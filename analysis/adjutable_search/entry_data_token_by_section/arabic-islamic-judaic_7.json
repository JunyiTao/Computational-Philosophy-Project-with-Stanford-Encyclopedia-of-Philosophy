    "main_text": "Ibn Tufayl\n8. Ibn Tufayl\n\nThe unique well-known work by the Spanish Arabo-Islamic philosopher\nIbn Tufayl (d. 1185), the Living Son of the Watchful\n(Hayy ben Yaqzan), exerted a substantially limited\n\u2018influence\u2019 over Medieval Jewish philosophy. For example,\nPines affirms that \u201cthere is no evidence to show that Maimonides\nwas in any way influenced by Ibn Tufayl\u2019s philosophic\ntale\u201d, although this influence cannot be totally excluded (Moses\nMaimonides 1963, 1:cviii; see also Davidson 2005, 115\u2013116).\n\nThe main one among the very few cases of a direct influence of Ibn\nTufayl on a relevant figure of Medieval Judaic thought is the\nanonymous Hebrew translation of his work (bearing the title\nIggeret Hayawan ben Yaqtsan), which was commented on by Moses\nNarboni; Narboni\u2019s commentary (apparently, the only extant one\non this text) was written in 1349 and has been very recently published\nby Maurice-Ruben Hayoun (Hayoun 2002). Narboni\u2019s commentary\nbears the title Epistle of Conjunction (Iggeret\nha-devequt), so showing that Narboni might have commented on this\nparticular text in order to find in it a substantial confirmation of\nthe well-known doctrine about the conjunction between man and the\nActive Intellect. As a matter of fact, like in the case of Ibn\nBajja\u2019s philosophical works, Narboni himself might have been the\ntranslator of this work from Arabic into Hebrew, or at least might\nhave assigned this translation to a member of his \u201cteam\u201d.\nNarboni\u2019s interpretation of Ibn Tufayl\u2019s work influenced a\nnumber of 15th-century Jewish philosophers, mostly in Spain\nand Italy, who knew and in some cases were strongly connected to\nAverroism (see Steinschneider 1893, 366\u2013368): Joseph Ibn Shem\nTov (living around 1450), Abraham Bibago (d. 1489), Isaac Arama, Isaac\nAbravanel (1437\u20131508), Yohanan Alemanno (living in the second\nhalf of the 15th century). Finally, it should be noted that\nIbn Tufayl\u2019s works (not only the Living Son of the\nWatchful, but also some minor works, apparently lost in their\noriginal Arabic texts) appeared among the main sources of a typical\nexample of eclectic \u201cJewish Avicennism\u201d in\n14th-century Spain: Joseph Ibn Waqqar\u2019s Treatise\nfor Reconciling Philosophy and Religious Law (see Vajda 1962,\n128, 132).\n",
