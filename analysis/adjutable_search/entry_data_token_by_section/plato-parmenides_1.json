The Introductory Section: Zeno\u2019s Argument 126a\u2013128e\n\n\nThe dialogue\u2019s narrator is Cephalus, who has just arrived in\nAthens after a trip from his home in Clazomenae. Cephalus runs\ninto Plato\u2019s half brothers, Adeimantus and Glaucon, and asks them\nto confirm the existence of someone who has completely memorized a\nconversation that Parmenides and Zeno once had with Socrates.\nAdeimantus confirms that his half brother, Antiphon, can recite the\nconversation in toto, having heard it from a friend of\nZeno\u2019s, Pythodorus, in whose house the conversation took\nplace. Cephalus, Adeimantus, and Glaucon then pay a visit to\nAntiphon, who, after a bit of prodding, agrees to replay the\nconversation. As most scholars agree, the conversation putatively\nrecorded by Pythodorus, passed on to Antiphon, and then recounted to\nCephalus, is almost certainly fictitious. This hypothesis partly\nexplains why Plato chose to frame the dialogue at third\nremove.\n\n\nAs Antiphon tells the story, the noted Eleatic philosophers, Parmenides\n(then around 65 years old) and Zeno (then around 40 years old), have\ncome to Athens for the Great Panathenaea. Having heard of their\narrival, a youthful Socrates (then around 20 years old) and some\nfriends of his have come to Pythodorus\u2019s house to listen to Zeno\nread from his book. At the end of Zeno\u2019s performance,\nPythodorus, Parmenides, and Aristotle, who have been waiting outside\nthe house, return and witness an exchange between Zeno and\nSocrates.\n\n\nThe exchange begins with Socrates\u2019 summary of the general\nstructure of one of Zeno\u2019s arguments:\n\nIf the things that are are many, then they are both like and\nunlike.\nNothing can be both like and unlike.\n\nSo,\n\nThe things that are are not many.\n\n\n\nZeno then explains that he intends this argument as a kind of\ndefense of Parmenides\u2019 monism: just as others have argued that\nmonism leads to absurd results (Zeno may be thinking here of the sorts\nof absurdities mentioned by Plato at Sophist 244b\u2013245e), so\npluralism suffers consequences that are, if anything, even more\nabsurd.\n",
