    "main_text": "\n\nFechner\u2019s philosophy is characterized by a clash between his\nmetaphysical interests and his positivist proclivities. His\nmetaphysical interests led him toward panpsychism: the doctrine that\nthe universe is created and governed by mind or the soul; his\npositivist leanings led him to uphold an early version of\nverificationism and phenomenalism. Fechner insisted that there was no\ndisparity between these tendencies, that the best scientific evidence\nsupported the view that the universe is psychic. His philosophy of\nmind is an early form of neutral monism.\n",
