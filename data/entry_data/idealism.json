    "main_text": "\n1. Introduction\n\nThe terms \u201cidealism\u201d and \u201cidealist\u201d are by no\nmeans used only within philosophy; they are used in many everyday\ncontexts as well. Optimists who believe that, in the long run, good\nwill prevail are often called \u201cidealists\u201d. This is not\nbecause such people are thought to be devoted to a philosophical\ndoctrine but because of their outlook on life generally; indeed, they\nmay even be pitied, or perhaps envied, for displaying a na\u00efve\nworldview and not being philosophically critical at all. Even within\nphilosophy, the terms \u201cidealism\u201d and\n\u201cidealist\u201d are used in different ways, which often makes\ntheir meaning dependent on the context. However, independently of\ncontext one can distinguish between a descriptive (or classificatory)\nuse of these terms and a polemical one, although sometimes these\ndifferent uses occur together. Their descriptive use is best\ndocumented by paying attention to the large number of different\n\u201cidealisms\u201d that appear in philosophical textbooks and\nencyclopedias, ranging from metaphysical idealism through\nepistemological and aesthetic to moral or ethical idealism. Within\nthese idealisms one can find further distinctions, such as those\nbetween subjective, objective and absolute idealism, and even more\nobscure characterizations such as speculative idealism and\ntranscendental idealism. It is also remarkable that the term\n\u201cidealism\u201d, at least within philosophy, is often used in\nsuch a way that it gets its meaning through what is taken to be its\nopposite: as the meaningful use of the term \u201coutside\u201d\ndepends on a contrast with something considered to be inside, so the\nmeaning of the term \u201cidealism\u201d is often fixed by what is\ntaken to be its opposite. Thus, an idealist is someone who is not a\nrealist, not a materialist, not a dogmatist, not an empiricist, and so\non. Given the fact that many also want to distinguish between realism,\nmaterialism, dogmatism, and empiricism, it is obvious that thinking of\nthe meaning of \u201cidealism\u201d as determined by what it is\nmeant to be opposed to leads to further complexity and gives rise to\nthe impression that underlying such characterizations lies some\npolemical intent.\n\nWithin modern philosophy there are sometimes taken to be two\nfundamental conceptions of idealism:\n\nsomething mental (the mind, spirit, reason, will) is the ultimate\nfoundation of all reality, or even exhaustive of reality, and\nalthough the existence of something independent of the mind is\nconceded, everything that we can know about this\nmind-independent \u201creality\u201d is held to be so permeated by\nthe creative, formative, or constructive activities of the mind (of\nsome kind or other) that all claims to knowledge must be considered,\nin some sense, to be a form of self-knowledge.\n\n\nIdealism in sense (1) has been called \u201cmetaphysical\u201d or\n\u201contological idealism\u201d, while idealism in sense (2) has\nbeen called \u201cformal\u201d or \u201cepistemological\nidealism\u201d. The modern paradigm of idealism in sense (1) might be\nconsidered to be George Berkeley\u2019s \u201cimmaterialism\u201d,\naccording to which all that exists are ideas and the minds, less than\ndivine or divine, that have them. (Berkeley himself did not use the\nterm \u201cidealism\u201d.) The fountainhead for idealism in sense\n(2) might be the position that Immanuel Kant asserted (if not clearly\nin the first edition of his Critique of Pure Reason (1781)\nthen in his Prolegomena to Any Future Metaphysics (1783) and\nin the \u201cRefutation of Idealism\u201d in the second edition of\nthe Critique) according to which idealism does \u201cnot\nconcern the existence of things\u201d, but asserts only that our\n\u201cmodes of representation\u201d of them, above all space and\ntime, are not \u201cdeterminations that belong to things in\nthemselves\u201d but features of our own minds. Kant called his\nposition \u201ctranscendental\u201d and \u201ccritical\u201d\nidealism, and it has also been called \u201cformal\u201d idealism.\nHowever, Kant\u2019s position does not provide a clear model of\nidealism at all. While Kant himself claimed that his position combined\n\u201cempirical realism\u201d with \u201ctranscendental\nidealism\u201d, that is, combined realism about external,\nspatio-temporal objects in ordinary life and science with the denial\nof the reality of space and time at the level of things as they are in\nthemselves, it also insisted upon the reality of things as they are in\nthemselves existing independently from our representations of them,\nthus denying their reducibility to representations or the minds that\nhave them. In this way, Kant\u2019s position actually combines the\ntranscendental ideality of space and time with a kind of realism about\nthe existence of things other than minds. \n\nSo instead of using Kant as any kind of model for epistemological\nidealism, in this entry we will distinguish between metaphysical and\nepistemological arguments for idealism understood as a metaphysical\ndoctrine, namely that everything that exists is in some way mental. We\nthus agree with A.C. Ewing, who wrote in 1934 that all forms of\nidealism \n\n\nhave in common the view that there can be no physical objects existing\napart from some experience, and this might perhaps be taken as the\ndefinition of idealism, provided that we regard thinking as part of\nexperience and do not imply by \u201cexperience\u201d passivity, and\nprovided we include under experience not only human experience but the\nso-called \u201cAbsolute Experience\u201d or the experience of a God\nsuch as Berkeley postulates. (Ewing 1934: 3) \n\n\nin other words, while reducing all reality to some kind of perception\nis one form of idealism, it is not the only form\u2014reality may be\nreduced to the mental on other conceptions of the latter. Thus Willem\ndeVries\u2019s more recent definition of idealism as the general\ntheory that reduces reality to some form or other of the mental is\njust: \n\n\nRoughly, the genus comprises theories that attribute ontological\npriority to the mental, especially the conceptual or ideational, over\nthe non-mental. (deVries 2009: 211) \n\n\nWe also agree with Jeremy Dunham, Iain Hamilton Grant, and Sean Watson\nwhen they write that \n\n\nthe idealist, rather than being anti-realist, is in fact \u2026 a\nrealist concerning elements more usually dismissed from reality.\n(Dunham, Grant, & Watson 2011: 4) \n\n\nnamely mind of some kind or other: the idealist denies the\nmind-independent reality of matter, but hardly denies the reality of\nmind (or, on their account, which goes back to Plato, Ideas or Forms\nas well as minds; we will not consider pre-modern forms of idealism in\nany detail). However, following Ewing (see his chapters II,\nIV\u2013V, and VIII), we will distinguish metaphysical from\nepistemological arguments for idealism. Metaphysical arguments proceed\nby identifying some general constraints on existence and arguing that\nonly minds of some sort or other satisfy such conditions;\nepistemological arguments work by identifying some conditions for\nknowledge and arguing that only objects that are in some sense or\nother mental can satisfy the conditions for being known. In\nparticular, epistemological arguments for idealism assume that there\nis a necessary isomorphism between knowledge and its object\nthat can obtain only if the object of knowledge is itself mental; we\npropose that this is the difference between\nepistemologically-motivated idealism and a more neutral position,\nwhich might be identified with philosophers such as Rudolf Carnap,\nW.V.O. Quine, and Donald Davidson, holding that of course we always\nknow things from some point of view, but any \u201cexternal\u201d\nquestion about whether or not our point of view\n\u201ccorresponds\u201d to independent reality is either meaningless\nor at least not answerable on theoretical grounds. It is in order to\npreserve the distinction between traditional idealism and positions\nsuch as the latter that we recommend retaining the claim that reality\nis in some way or other exclusively mental and thinking of\nepistemological arguments for idealism rather than epistemological\nidealism as such.\n\nOf course these strategies can be combined by a single philosopher.\nBerkeley does so, and so does Kant in arguing for the transcendental\nidealist part of his complex position. Others separate them, for\nexample F.H. Bradley and J.McT.E. McTaggart constructed metaphysical\narguments for idealism, while Josiah Royce and Brand Blanshard offered\nepistemological arguments.\n\nIn what follows, we will concentrate mainly on the discussion of\nphilosophical theories that either endorse or claim to endorse\nidealism on ontological and/or epistemological grounds. At some points\nin its complex history, however, above all in the social as well as\nphilosophical movement that dominated British and American\nuniversities in the second half of the nineteenth century and through\nthe first World War, idealism in either of its philosophical forms was\nindeed connected to idealism in the popular sense of progressive and\noptimistic social thought. This was true for figures such as Bradley\nand Royce and their predecessors and contemporaries such as Thomas\nHill Green and Bernard Bosanquet. There has recently been considerable\ninterest in British or more generally Anglophone idealism as a\nmovement in social philosophy, or even a social movement, but we will\nnot pursue that here (see Mander 2011; Boucher & Vincent 2012;\nMander [ed.] 2000; and Mander & Panagakou [eds.] 2016).\n\nOur distinctions between epistemological and ontological idealism, on\nthe one hand, and that between metaphysical and epistemological\narguments for idealism, on the other hand, has not always been clearly\nmade. However, the American philosopher Josiah Royce pointed in the\ndirection of our distinction at the end of the nineteenth century. On\nRoyce\u2019s definitions, epistemological idealism\n\n\ninvolves a theory of the nature of our human knowledge; and\nvarious decidedly different theories are called by this name in view\nof one common feature, namely, the stress that they lay upon the\n\u201csubjectivity\u201d of a larger or smaller portion of what\npretends to be our knowledge of things. (1892: xii\u2013xiii)\n\n\nMetaphysical idealism, he says, \u201cis a theory as to the\nnature of the real world, however we may come to know that\nnature\u201d (1892: xiii), namely, as he says quoting from another\nphilosopher of the time, \n\n\nthe \u201cbelief in a spiritual principle at the basis of the world,\nwithout the reduction of the physical world to a mere illusion\u201d.\n(1892: xiii; quoting Falckenberg 1886: 476). \n\n\nBut Royce then argued that epistemological idealism ultimately entails\na foundation of metaphysical idealism, in particular that \u201cthe\nquestion as to how we \u2018transcend\u2019 the\n\u2018subjective\u2019 in our knowledge\u201d, that is, the purely\nindividual, although it exists for both metaphysical realists and\nidealists, can only be answered by metaphysical idealists (1892: xiv).\nWe will argue similarly that while epistemology can entail idealism,\non the assumption that the isomorphism between knowledge and the known\nmust be in some sense necessary and that this can be so only if the\nknown as well as knowledge is in some sense mental, this should be\ndistinguished from the more general and extremely widespread view that\nour knowledge is always formed within our own point of view,\nconceptual framework, or web of belief. This view may well be the\ndefault position of much twentieth-century philosophy,\n\u201ccontinental\u201d as well as \u201canalytic\u201d, but does\nnot by itself entail that reality is essentially mental.\n\nOur distinction between epistemological and metaphysical arguments for\nidealism can also be associated with a distinction between two major\nkinds of motives for idealism: those which are grounded in\nself-conceptions, i.e., in convictions about the role that the self or\nthe human being plays in the world, and those based on what might\ncorrespondingly be called world-convictions, i.e., on conceptions\nabout the way the world is constituted objectively or at least appears\nto be constituted to a human subject. Concerning motives based on\nself-conceptions of human beings, idealism has seemed hard to avoid by\nmany who have taken freedom in one of its many guises (freedom of\nchoice, freedom of the will, freedom as autonomy) to be an integral\npart of any conception of the self worth pursuing, because the belief\nin the reality of freedom often goes together with a commitment to\nsome version of mental causation, and it is tempting to think that the\neasiest (or at least the most economical) way to account for mental\ncausation consists in \u201cmentalizing\u201d or idealizing all of\nreality, thus leading to ontological idealism, or at least to maintain\nthat the kind of causal determinism that seems to conflict with\nfreedom is only one of our ways of representing the world, thus\nleading to epistemological idealism. Motives for idealism based on\nworld-convictions can be found in many different attitudes towards\nobjectivity. If one is to believe in science as the best and only way\nto get an objective (subject-independent) conception of reality, one\nmight still turn to idealism, at least epistemological idealism,\nbecause of the conditions supposed to be necessary in order to make\nsense of the very concept of a law (of nature) or of the normativity\nof logical inferences for nature itself. If one believes in the\nnon-conventional reality of normative facts one might also be drawn to\nidealism in order to account for their non-physical\nreality\u2014Plato\u2019s idealism, which asserts the reality of\nnon-physical Ideas to explain the status of norms and then reduces all\nother reality to mere simulacra of the former might be considered a\nforerunner of ontological idealism motivated by concern for the\nreality of norms. An inclination toward idealism might even arise from\nconsiderations pertaining to the ontological status of aesthetic\nvalues (is beauty an objective attribute of objects?) or from the\ninability or the unwillingness to think of the constitution of social\nand cultural phenomena like society or religion in terms of physical\ntheory. In short: There are about as many motives and reasons for\nendorsing idealism as there are different aspects of reality to be\nknown or explained.\n\nAlthough we have just referred to Plato, the term\n\u201cidealism\u201d became the name for a whole family of positions\nin philosophy only in the course of the eighteenth century. Even then,\nthose whom critics called \u201cidealists\u201d did not identify\nthemselves as such until the time of Kant, and no sooner did the label\ncome into use than did those to whom it was applied or who used it\nthemselves attempt to escape it or refine it. As already mentioned,\nBerkeley, the paradigmatic idealist in the British tradition, did not\nuse the name for his own position, which he called rather\nimmaterialism; and Leibniz, at least some versions of whose monadology\nmight be considered idealist, also did not call his position by that\nname. Rather, in contrasting Epicurus with Plato, Leibniz called the\nlatter an idealist and the former a materialist, because according to\nhim idealists like Plato hold that \u201ceverything occurs in the\nsoul as if there were no body\u201d whereas on the materialism of\nEpicurus \u201ceverything occurs in the body as if there were no\nsoul\u201d (\u201cReply to the Thoughts on the System of\nPre-established Harmony contained in the Second Edition of Mr.\nBayle\u2019s Critical Dictionary, Article Rorarius\u201d, 1702,\nPPL: 578), although in this text Leibniz also says that his\nown view combines both of these positions. It seems to have been\nChristian Wolff who first used \u201cidealism\u201d explicitly as a\nclassificatory term. Wolff, often considered the most dedicated\nLeibnizian of his time (although in fact his position was more\neclectic than at least some versions of Leibniz\u2019s) set out to\nintegrate the terms \u201cidealism\u201d and\n\u201cmaterialism\u201d into his taxonomy of philosophical attitudes\nof those \u201cwho strive towards the knowledge and philosophy of\nthings\u201d in the Preface to the other [second] Edition of\nhis so-called German Metaphysics [Vern\u00fcnfftige\nGedancken von Gott, der Welt und der Seele des Menschen, auch allen\nDingen \u00fcberhaupt, den Liebhabern der Wahrheit mitgetheilet\n(Halle: Carl Hermann Hemmerde, 1747)]. Wolff distinguishes between two\nbasic attitudes, one of which he sees exemplified by the skeptic, the\nother by what he calls \u201cthe dogmatist\u201d. The skeptic doubts\nthe possibility of knowledge in general and thus refuses to defend any\npositive claim at all. By contrast, the dogmatist puts forward\npositive doctrines, and these can be divided into those which posit as\nfundamental either one single kind of entities [Art der\nDinge] or two different kinds. Wolff names the supporters of the\nfirst position \u201cmonists\u201d and the adherents of the second\n\u201cdualists\u201d. This amounts to the division of all dogmatic\ndoctrines, i.e., all knowledge-claims with respect to the ultimate\nconstitution of reality, into monistic and dualistic theories. Here is\nwhere the term \u201cidealist\u201d then makes its appearance in\nWolff\u2019s typology: he distinguishes within the monists between\nidealists and materialists. Idealists \u201cconcede only spirits or\nelse those things that do not consist of matter\u201d, whereas\nmaterialists \u201cdo not accept anything in philosophy other than\nthe corporeal and take spirits and souls to be a corporeal\nforce\u201d. Dualists, on the contrary, are happy \u201cto accept\nboth bodies and spirits as real and mutually independent\nthings\u201d. Wolff then goes on to distinguish within idealism\nbetween \u201cegoism\u201d and \u201cpluralism\u201d, depending on\nwhether an idealist thinks just of himself as a real entity or whether\nhe will allow for more than one (spiritual) entity; the first of these\npositions would also come to be called solipsism, so that solipsism\nwould be a variety of (ontological) idealism but not all idealism\nwould be solipsism.\n\nWolff\u2019s way of classifying a philosophical system was enormously\ninfluential in eighteenth-century Continental philosophy\u2014for\nexample, it was closely followed by Alexander Gottlieb Baumgarten in\nhis 1739 Metaphysica, which was in turn used by Kant as the\ntextbook for his metaphysics (and anthropology) lectures throughout\nhis career, and whose definition of dogmatic idealism, as contrasted\nto his own \u201ctranscendental\u201d or \u201ccritical\u201d\nidealism, would also be that it is the position according to which\nthere are only minds\u2014and so it is no surprise that almost all\ntalk about idealism was heavily influenced by Wolff\u2019s\ncharacterization. This is so because it reflects the main metaphysical\ndisputes in seventeenth- and early eighteenth-century philosophy on\nthe Continent quite well. In terms of Wolff\u2019s distinctions,\nthese disputes can be framed as disputes between (a) monists and\ndualists and (b) idealists and materialists; positions in this debate\nwere often influenced by perplexities surrounding the (ontological)\nquestion of the interaction of substances, although they were also\ninfluenced by the (epistemological) debate over innatism. Although\nneither dualism, whose main representative was Descartes (who asserted\nthe existence of both res cogitans and res extensa),\nnor monism, allegedly though debatably represented by Spinoza in its\nmaterialistic version (substantia, deus, natura) and by\nLeibniz in its idealistic form (monad, entelechy, simple substance)\nsucceeded in finding satisfying answers to this and related questions,\nin the early modern era these disputes shaped the conception of what\nthe object of metaphysics (metaphysica generalis sive\nontologia) was supposed to be.\n2. Idealism in Early Modern Rationalism\n\nPrior to Wolff, neither defending nor refuting idealism seems to have\nbeen a central issue for rationalist philosophers, and none of them\ncalled themselves idealists. Yet what are by later lights idealistic\ntendencies can nevertheless be found among them.\n\nWhile Descartes\u2019s \u201cfirst philosophy\u201d clearly defends\ndualism, he takes his target to be skepticism rather than idealism,\nand thus is from our point of view concerned to resist the adoption of\nepistemological grounds; Spinoza is often though controversially\nthought to defend a form of materialism, but takes his primary target\nto be pluralism as contrasted to monism; and Leibniz does not seem\noverly worried about choosing between idealist and dualist forms of\nhis \u201cmonadology\u201d, while his famous thesis that each monad\nrepresents the entire universe from its own point of view might be\ntaken to be a form of epistemological ground for idealism, but Leibniz\ndoes not seem to conceive of it as such. Nicolas Malebranche\u2019s\ntheory of \u201cseeing all things in God\u201d might be the closest\nwe find to an explicit assertion in seventeenth-century philosophy of\nan argument for idealism on both epistemological and ontological\ngrounds, and thus as a forerunner of the \u201cabsolute\u201d\nidealism of the nineteenth century. While from a later point of view\nit may seem surprising that these rationalists were not more concerned\nwith explicitly asserting or refuting one or both versions of\nidealism, perhaps they were more concerned with theological puzzles\nabout the nature and essence of God, metaphysical questions as to how\nto reconcile the respective conception of God with views about the\ninteraction of substances of fundamentally different kinds, and\nepistemological problems as to the possibility of knowledge and\ncognitive certainty than they were worried about whether the ultimate\nconstituents of reality were mental or material elements.\n\nHowever, if one were to situate their thoughts within the framework\nprovided by Wolff it is not that difficult to find traces of idealism\nderived from both ontological and epistemological grounds in their\nrespective positions. With respect to their metaphysical or\nontological teachings, this claim may seem surprising. Whereas\naccording to Wolff idealists are representatives of a species of\nmetaphysical monism Descartes is one of the most outspoken\nmetaphysical dualists. Hence to impute idealistic tendencies to\nDescartes\u2019 metaphysics looks like a mistake. And in the case of\nSpinoza one could argue that although he definitely is a (very\nradical) monist and thus could count as an idealist within\nWolff\u2019s taxonomy, he is traditionally considered to be rather a\nmaterialist in Wolff\u2019s sense. Consequently, it appears as if\nalready for conceptual reasons there is no basis to burden either\nDescartes or Spinoza with idealism as defined by Wolff. Leibniz,\nmeanwhile, often seems unwilling to commit himself to idealism even\nthough that is the most natural interpretation of his monadology,\nwhile only Malebranche, as noted, seems to come close to explicitly\nasserting epistemological and perhaps ontological arguments for\nidealism as well.\n\nNevertheless, both Descartes and Spinoza provide a starting point for\ntheir metaphysical doctrines with their conceptions of God, a starting\npoint that is already infected with idealistic elements if idealism is\nunderstood as implying a commitment to the primacy or at least the\nunavoidability and irreducibility of mental items in the constitution\nand order of things in general. Both agree that in order to gain\ninsight into the constitution of the world one has to find out what\nGod wants us, or maybe better: allows us to know about it (see, e.g.,\nDescartes: Meditations IV, 7\u20138 and especially 13;\nSpinoza: Ethics I, XVI). They also agree that the world is\ncreated by God although they have different views as to what this\nmeans. Whereas Descartes thinks of God as existing outside the world\nof the existing things He created (see Meditations III, 13\nand 22) Spinoza holds that whatever exists is just a peculiar way in\nwhich God is present (see Ethics I, XXV, Corollary). Of all\nexisting things all that God permits us to know clearly and distinctly\nis (again according to both Descartes and Spinoza) that their nature\nconsists either in thinking or in extension. This claim can be seen as\nproviding in the case of Descartes the basis for his justification of\nontological dualism. His distinction between extended and thinking\nsubstances is not just meant to give rise to a complete classification\nof all existing things in virtue of their main attributes but also to\nhighlight the irreducibility of mental (thinking) substances to\nphysical or corporeal (extended) substances because of differences\nbetween their intrinsic natures (see, e.g., Meditations VI,\n19, and Principles of Philosophy I, 51\u201354). In the case\nof Spinoza thinking and extension not only refer to attributes of\nindividual things but primarily to attributes of God (see Ethics\nII, Proposition I, II, and VII, Scholium), making them the\nfundamental ways in which God himself expresses his nature in each\nindividual thing. This move gives rise to his ontological monism\nbecause he can claim that all individual things are just modes in\nwhich God\u2019s presence is expressed according to these\nattributes.\n\nAlthough the idea that God is the creator of the world of individual\nexisting things (Descartes) or that God himself is manifested in every\nindividual existing thing (Spinoza) might already be considered to be\nsufficient as a motivating force for subsequent disputes as to the\ntrue nature of reality and thus might have given rise to what were\nthen called \u201cidealistic\u201d positions in ontology, other\npeculiarities within Descartes\u2019 and Spinoza\u2019s position\nmight well have led to the same result, i.e., to the adoption of\nidealism on ontological grounds. Especially their disagreement about\nGod\u2019s corporeality might have been such a motive. Whereas\nDescartes vigorously denies the corporeality of God (Principles of\nPhilosophy I, 23) and hence could be seen as endorsing idealism,\nSpinoza vehemently insists on God\u2019s corporeality (Ethics\nI, Proposition XV, Scholium) and thus could be taken to be in\nfavor of materialism.\n\nThings are different when it comes to epistemological grounds for\nidealism. It seems to be very difficult to connect Descartes\u2019\nand Spinoza\u2019s views concerning knowledge with conceptions\naccording to which knowledge has something to do with a cognizing\nsubject actively contributing to the constitution of the object of\nknowledge. This is so because both Descartes and Spinoza think of\ncognition as a result of a process in which we become aware of what\nreally is the case independently of us both with respect to the nature\nof objects and with respect to their conceptual and material\nrelations. Descartes and Spinoza take cognition to be a process of\ngrasping clear and distinct ideas of what is the true character of\nexisting things rather than a process of contributing to the formation\nof their nature. According to Descartes the sources of our knowledge\nof things are our abilities to have intuitions of the simple nature of\nthings and to draw conclusions from these intuitions via deduction\n(Rules for the Direction of the Mind III, 4 ff.). For him the\ncognitive procedure is a process of discovery (see Discourse on\nthe Method, Part 6, 6) of what already is out there as the real\nnature of things created by God by finding out the clear and distinct\nideas we can have of them (Discourse, Part 4, 3 and 7). In a\nsimilar vein Spinoza thinks of knowledge as an activity that in its\nhighest form as intuitive (or third genus of) cognition leads to an\nadequate insight into the essence of things (Ethics II,\nProposition XL, Scholium II, and Ethics V, Propositions\nXXV\u2013XXVIII), an insight that gives rise to general concepts\n(notiones communes) on which ratiocinationes, i.e.,\nthe processes of inference and deduction, are based (Ethics\nII, Proposition XL, Scholium I) the results of which provide the\nsecond genus of cognition (ratio). Thus the problem for both\nDescartes and Spinoza is not so much that of the epistemologically\nmotivated idealist, i.e., to uncover what we contribute through our\ncognitive faculties to our conception of an object, rather their\nproblem is to determine how it comes that we very often have a\ndistorted view of what there is and are accordingly led to misguided\nbeliefs and errors. Given what they take to be a basic fact that God\nhas endowed us with the capacity to know the truth (albeit within\ncertain limits), i.e., to know to a certain degree how or what things\nreally are, this interest in the possibility of error makes perfectly\ngood sense (Meditations IV, 3\u201317; Principles of\nPhilosophy I, 70\u201372; Ethics II, Proposition 49,\nScholium).\n\nIn his project for a \u201cuniversal characteristic\u201d, Leibniz\ncan be regarded as having taken great interest in a method\nfor inquiry, but he does not seem to have taken much interest in the\nepistemological issue of skepticism or the possibility of knowledge,\nand thus did not explicitly characterize his famous\n\u201cmonadology\u201d as a form of an epistemological ground for\nidealism. But he did take a great interest in the ontology of\nsubstances, God the infinite substance and everything else as finite\nsubstances (in contrast to Spinoza, he rejected monism). Yet while the\nlogic of his monadology clearly points toward idealism, Leibniz\nfrequently attempted to avoid this conclusion. One explicitly\nontological argument for the monadology that Leibniz often deploys is\nthat, on pain of infinite regress, everything composite must\nultimately consist of simples, but that since space and time are\ninfinitely divisible extended matter cannot be simple while thoughts,\neven with complex content, do not literally have parts, nor do the\nminds that have them, so minds, or monads, are the only candidates for\nthe ultimate constituents of reality. Thus the late text entitled\n\u201cThe Monadology\u201d begins with the assertions that \n\n\nThe monad which we are here to discuss is nothing but a\nsimple substance which enters into compounds, \n\n\nthat \n\n\nThere must be simple substances, since there are compounds, [and] the\ncompounded is but a collection or an aggregate of simples,\n\n\n\nbut that \n\n\nwhere there are no parts, it is impossible to have either extension,\nor figure, or divisibility \n\n\nand conversely where there is simplicity there cannot be extension or\nfigure or divisibility (\u00a7\u00a71\u20133). Yet monads must have\nsome qualities in order to exist (\u00a78) and to differ from one\nanother, as they must (\u00a79), and if the fundamental properties of\nmatter are excluded, this leaves the fundamental properties of mind,\nwhich Leibniz holds to be perception, \u201cThe passing state which\nenfolds and represents a multitude in unity\u201d (\u00a714) and\nappetition, \u201cthe internal principle which brings about change or\nthe passage from one perception to another\u201d (\u00a715; all from\nPPL: 643\u20134). This argument clearly seems to imply that\nall finite substances are ultimately mental in nature (and the\ninfinite substance, God, is obviously mental in nature), thus it seems\nto be a paradigmatic ontological argument for idealism, from which an\nepistemological argument for idealism would automatically follow,\nsince if there is knowledge of reality at all, which Leibniz hardly\nseems to doubt, and reality is ultimately mental, then knowledge too\nmust be of the mental.\n\nYet Leibniz often seems to avert such a conclusion by appeal to his\nidea of \u201cpre-established harmony\u201d, and this is possible\nbecause he himself interprets this idea in two different ways. Early\nin his career, in such texts as \u201cPrimary Truths\u201d\n(1680\u201384) and the \u201cDiscourse on Metaphysics\u201d (1686)\n(both texts unpublished in Leibniz\u2019s lifetime and not known to\nhis immediate successors such as Wolff and Baumgarten), Leibniz\nintroduces the doctrine of pre-established harmony on\ntruth-theoretical grounds. His argument is that everything that is\ntrue of a substance is so because the predicate of a true proposition\nis contained in the complete concept of its subject and because that\ncomplete concept reflects the properties or \u201ctraces\u201d in\nthe substance that is that subject; that there are true propositions\nlinking every substance in the world to every other, thus the complete\nconcept of each substance must be a complete concept of the universe\nitself and each substance must bear within itself as properties traces\nof every other in the universe; and thus that each substance must\nreflect, or, as mental, represent the entire universe. Yet since\n(finite) substances are also defined as existing independently of one\nanother (although not existing independently from the infinite\nsubstance, God), there is a question as to why each should truthfully\nrepresent all the others, which Leibniz answers by appeal to the idea\nof a pre-established harmony: although considered from the point of\nview of the concept of substance it does not seem necessary that every\nsubstance truly represent all the others, in his goodness, thus in his\npreference for a maximally harmonious world, God has nevertheless made\nit such that they do.\n\nIn this mood, Leibniz tends to explain the existence of body as an\nartifact of the fact that each monad represents the world from its own\npoint of view: physical locations and the bodies that occupy them are\njust the way in which the difference in the points of view of the\nmonads is represented by them, but have no deeper reality; or, as\nLeibniz often says, space, spatiality, and bodies are just\nphenomena bene fundata, i.e., \u201cwell-founded modes of\nour consideration\u201d (PPL: 270).\n\nHowever, sometimes Leibniz writes as if space and time are not merely\nthe way in which the pre-established harmony among monads presents\nitself to (their) consciousness, but as if the mental and physical or\nextended are two separate realms, each evolving entirely in accordance\nwith its own laws, but with a pre-established harmony between\nthem creating the appearance of interaction. Perhaps Leibniz was\ngenuinely undecided between two interpretations of the pre-established\nharmony and two conceptions of the reality of body, sometimes being a\ncommitted idealism and sometimes a dualist. (As we will see later,\neven among the most committed absolute idealists of the nineteenth\ncentury it is not always clear whether they are actually denying the\nexistence of matter or only subordinating it to mind in one way or\nanother).\n\nLeibniz\u2019s monadology could thus be seen as a forerunner of both\nepistemological and ontological arguments for idealism, and his\nconception of space and time as phenomena bene fundata was\nclearly a forerunner of Kant\u2019s transcendental idealism. But as\nwe have just seen, he did not himself unequivocally affirm idealism,\nand as we will shortly see subsequent Leibnizians such as Alexander\nBaumgarten argued for dualism and for a corresponding interpretation\nof pre-established harmony. Nicolas Malebranche was also a dualist,\ncommitted to the existence of both mind and body, and an\noccasionalist, who held that since causation is necessary connection\nand the only truly necessary connection is between God\u2019s\nintentions and their effects, bodies cannot directly cause\nmodifications of minds (or each other) but rather there can be a\ncausal relation between body and mind only if God intends the mind to\nundergo a certain modification upon the occasion of a certain change\nin a body (hence the term \u201coccasionalism\u201d). This is a\nmetaphysical argument. His further doctrine that the mind sees all\nthings in God, however, can be seen as an epistemological argument,\nfor it depends on his particular view of what modifications the mind\nundergoes in perception. He holds that sensations are\nliterally modifications in the mind, but that they are highly\nindeterminate, or in later terminology lack determinate intentional\nobjects, and that genuine understanding occurs only when and to the\nextent that the determinate ideas in the perfect intellect of\nGod are disclosed to finite, human minds, to the extent that they are.\nMalebranche\u2019s position can be considered a theological form of\nPlatonism: Plato held that the true Ideas or Forms of things have a\nkind of perfection that neither ordinary objects nor representations\nof them in human minds do, and therefore must exist someplace else;\nMalebranche takes the obvious further step of supposing that perfect\nideas can exist only in the perfect intellect of God. He then supposes\nthat human thought is intelligible to the extent that these ideas are\ndisclosed to it, on the occasion of various sensations themselves\noccasioned by God but not literally through those sensations. The\ncrucial point is that genuine understanding consists in the\napprehension of ideas, even though these are literally in the mind of\nGod rather than of individual human beings, rather than of physical\nobjects, even though the latter do exist. Malebranche had significant\ninfluence on both Berkeley and Hume, although neither the former and\ncertainly not the latter accepted his position in its entirety. His\nposition that knowledge consists in individual minds apprehending\nideas in some greater mind would also be recreated by idealists as\nlate as T.H. Green and Josiah Royce in the second half of the\nnineteenth century, as we will later see.\n\nBefore we turn to British or Anglophone versions of idealism, earlier\nor later, one last word about idealism within pre-Kantian rationalist\nphilosophy is in order. As earlier mentioned, dualism rather than\nidealism became the default position of the German successors to\nLeibniz, the so-called \u201cLeibnizo-Wolffians\u201d who dominated\nthe teaching of philosophy in many German universities for fifty years\nfrom the third decade of the eighteenth century until the time of Kant\nand in some cases even beyond, and they correspondingly opted for the\ninterpretation of the pre-established harmony as a relation between\nminds and bodies rather than among minds or monads alone. It may also\nbe noted that defending dualism by means of an explicit\n\u201crefutation of idealism\u201d became the norm among these\nphilosophers. This may be seen in Alexander Gottlieb\nBaumgarten\u2019s Metaphysica of 1739, which would become\nKant\u2019s textbook for his lecture courses in metaphysics and\n\u201canthropology\u201d (empirical psychology) until the very end\nof the eighteenth century. Baumgarten accepts that the ultimate\nconstituents of the world must be simples, hence monads of some kind.\nBut he does not suppose that monads are necessarily minds or\nintellects, hence a dualism of monads is at least possible. Idealism\nwould be the position that there are only intellectual monads; he says\nthat\n\n\nAn intellectual substance, i.e., a substance endowed with intellect,\nis a spirit (an intelligence, a person)\u2026. Whoever admits only\nspirits in this world is an idealist. (Metaphysics,\n\u00a7402, pp. 175\u20136)\n\n\nBaumgarten follows Wolff in distinguishing between two possible forms\nof idealism, first egoism, which admits the existence of only one\nspirit, that of the person contemplating such a doctrine, and then\nidealism proper, which allows the existence of multiple spirits. But\nboth are refuted by the same argument. This argument builds on a\nLeibnizian principle not hitherto mentioned, the principle of\nplenitude, or the principle that the perfection of the most perfect\nworld, which is the one that God created, consists in the maximal\nvariety of the universe compatible with its unity or coherence (e.g.,\n\u201cMonadology\u201d, \u00a758, PPL: 648), which was in\nturn the basis of one of Leibniz\u2019s arguments for the identity of\nindiscernibles. Baumgarten then argues simply that a universe that\ncontains not only more substances but also more kinds of\nsubstances rather than fewer is a more perfect universe, and\nnecessarily exists in preference to the other; and a universe that\ncontains not only multiple minds rather than a single mind but also\nbodies in addition to minds is therefore a more perfect universe than\neither of the former would be, and is therefore the kind of world that\nactually exists. In his words,\n\n\nthe egotistical world, such as an egoist posits, is not the most\nperfect. And even if there is only one non-intellectual monad possible\nin itself that is compossible with spirits in the world, whose\nperfection either subtracts nothing from the perfection of the\nspirits, or does not subtract from the perfection of the spirits so\nmuch as it adds to the perfection of the whole, then the idealistic\nworld, such as is posited by the idealist, is not the most perfect,\n(Metaphysics, \u00a7438, [2013: 183])\n\n\nand hence not the kind of world that exists. No one outside of the\nimmediate sphere of Leibnizianism would ever again proffer such a\nrefutation of idealism. But both Baumgarten\u2019s recognition of\nidealism and his refutation of it in a university textbook make it\nclear that by the middle of the eighteenth century idealism had become\na standard topic for philosophical discussion, a position it would\nretain for another century and a half or more.\n3. Idealism in Early Modern British philosophy\n\nThe relation between ontological and epistemological arguments for\nidealism is complex. Idealism can be argued for on ontological\ngrounds, and then bring an epistemological argument in its train. Or\nan epistemological argument can be offered independently of\nontological assumptions but lead to idealism, especially in the hope\nof avoiding skepticism. The first option may have been characteristic\nof some rationalists, such as Leibniz in his more strictly idealist\nmood. Both forms of argument are found within early modern British\nphilosophy. We find epistemological considerations pushing toward\nidealism in both Hobbes and Locke in spite of the avowed materialism\nof the first and dualism of the second, who therefore obviously did\nnot call themselves idealists. Berkeley argues for idealism on\nepistemological grounds and then adds ontological considerations in\norder to avert skepticism, although he calls his position\nimmaterialism rather than idealism. Berkeley\u2019s contemporary\nArthur Collier, who explicitly denies the existence of\nmind-independent matter without giving his own position a name, argues\nfirst in an epistemological mood, then moves from epistemology to\nontology. Hume, by contrast, although calling himself neither an\nimmaterialist nor an idealist, nevertheless adopts epistemological\narguments for idealism similar to some of Berkeley\u2019s, but then\nuses that position as the basis for a critique of traditional\nmetaphysical pretensions, including those to idealism\u2014while also\nbeing drawn to idealism in resistance to what he regards as the\nnatural tendency to dualism. Hume\u2019s critical attitude toward\nmetaphysics is subsequently taken up by Kant, although Kant famously\nasserts on practical grounds some of the very same metaphysical theses\nthat he argues cannot be asserted on theoretical grounds.\n\nThe British philosophers were all hostile toward dogmatic metaphysics\nin Wolff\u2019s sense, although until the time of Hume, who had some\nfamiliarity with Leibniz, the metaphysics with which they were\nfamiliar were those of Descartes, Aristotelian scholasticism, and\nNeo-Platonism, which had become domesticated in Britain through the\nwork of the Cambridge Platonists in the second half of the seventeenth\ncentury. All of these movements fed into the general movement of\nrationalism, while the British philosophers, typically lumped together\nunder the rubric of empiricism in spite of their own differences, all\nbelieved, albeit for different reasons, that the doctrines put forward\nby dogmatic metaphysicians rest on a totally unfounded conception of\nknowledge and cannot survive rational scrutiny (empiricists might\nthemselves be considered critical rationalists). Thus the primary task\nof philosophy for these philosophers became that of providing a theory\nof knowledge based on an adequate assessment of the constitution of\nhuman nature, for they were interested in knowledge only as a human\nachievement. However, it is not human nature in general that is of\ninterest in this context but the workings of those human powers or\nfaculties that are responsible for our human ability to relate to the\nworld in terms of knowledge-claims. (Thus Kant\u2019s attempt to\nargue on practical grounds for metaphysical theses that could not be\njustified on theoretical grounds would be a major departure from the\nmethods of the British empiricists.) These faculties were attributed\nby the British as well as their Continental opponents to what was\ncalled \u201cspirit\u201d or \u201cmind\u201d (mens,\nconsciousness, Bewu\u00dftsein), an attribution which\nresulted in moving the \u201coperations of the mind\u201d into the\ncenter of philosophical attention. Reflections on the conditions of\nthe possibility of knowledge led Hobbes and Locke to idealism in spite\nof their ontological commitments to materialism or dualism\nrespectively, while Berkeley concluded that their epistemology would\nlead to a skepticism that could be avoided only by his own more\nradical \u201cimmaterialist\u201d ontology. Hume\u2019s position\nremains complex and for this reason controversial. His thesis that our\nbeliefs in causation, external objects, and even the self are all\nfounded on \u201ccustom\u201d and imagination rather than\n\u201creason\u201d may be considered an epistemological position\nwithout ontological implications, thus not an argument for idealism;\nbut while he sometimes seems to attempt to avoid commitment on\nontological questions altogether, at other times, as in his argument\nthat the existence of external objects in addition to our impressions\nis only a fiction, he seems to infer idealism from his epistemology.\nIn spite of their differences, almost all British philosophers from\nHobbes up to and including Hume insisted that the highest priority for\nphilosophy is to give an analysis of the conditions and the origin of\nknowledge, while they gave not only somewhat different accounts of\nwhat these conditions consist in and how they contribute to a\nconvincing story about the origin of knowledge but they also had to\nface quite interesting \u201cmetaphysical\u201d consequences from\ntheir respective accounts.\n\nThis is easily confirmed by looking briefly at some of their main\nconvictions concerning knowledge, starting with Thomas Hobbes\n(1588\u20131679). As Hobbes points out in the chapters Of\nPhilosophy and Of Method in the first part\n(Computation or Logic) of the first section (Concerning\nBody) of his Elements of Philosophy (1655), knowledge is\nthe result of the manipulation of sensory input based on the\nemployment of logical rules of reasoning (ratiocination) in acts of\nwhat he calls \u201ccomputation\u201d. He describes the details of\nthis process most succinctly in a short passage in chapter 6 of the\nfirst part (Human Nature) of his The Elements of Law,\nNatural and Politic (1640), his first major philosophical work.\nAfter distinguishing what he calls \u201csense, or knowledge\noriginal\u201d from \u201cknowledge \u2026 which we call\nscience\u201d, he goes on to \u201cdefine\u201d knowledge \u201cto\nbe evidence of truth, from some beginning or principle of sense\u201d\nand formulates four principles that are constitutive of knowledge:\n\n\nThe first principle of knowledge therefore is that we have such and\nsuch conceptions; the second, that we have thus and thus named the\nthings whereof they are conceptions; the third is, that we have joined\nthose names in such manner, as to make true propositions; the fourth\nand last is, that we have joined those propositions in such manner as\nthey be concluding. (1640: I.6.4)\n\n\nThe message is straightforward with respect to both the basis and the\nformation of knowledge: senses (sensations) are basic to our\nacquisition of knowledge in that they lead to conceptions\n(representations) to which we attach names (concepts) which we then\nput together into propositions which, if true, already constitute\nknowledge, and from which there arise further knowledge if we draw\nconclusions in an orderly way from them.\n\nAlthough the account given by Hobbes of the origin and the formation\nof knowledge is rightly called empiricist because it traces all\nknowledge back to the senses or sensations and their non-sensory\ncauses, i.e., to what he calls \u201cthings without us\u201d, it is\nby no means directly committed to either idealism or dualism; on the\ncontrary, Hobbes\u2019s preferred ontological position is\nmaterialism. Nevertheless, his account may lead to an early form of\nepistemologically motivated idealism. This is so because although\nHobbes makes no claims as to either the constitution and the reality\nof what causes sensations or to any specific contribution on the part\nof the subject of knowledge to what we take to be the \u201caccidents\nor qualities\u201d of objects, he states, again most explicitly in\nthe part on Human Nature in The Elements of Law, (1)\nthat there are causes of our sensations which by way of their motions\ngive rise to what we sense as qualities, but (2) that these qualities\nonly have the status of \u201cseemings and apparitions\u201d. In his\nown words: \u201cThe things that really are in the world without us,\nare those motions by which these seemings are caused\u201d\n(Elements of Law, I.2.10). While he is confident that there\nare external objects, and thus has no intention of affirming idealism,\nnevertheless because in Hobbes\u2019s opinion we could have\nconceptions of these seemings even if there were no objects around\n(Elements of Law I.1.8) there is for him no basis on which to\nfound any metaphysical claims to the real existence of an external\nworld or any epistemological basis for claiming knowledge of the real\nconstitution of a subject-independent world or its real existence.\nThus, Hobbes\u2019s epistemology allows him at most agnosticism about\nthe existence of objects other than our representations of them, even\nif it does not force him into outright idealism. This is nicely\nconfirmed by a passage from part II (The First Grounds of\nPhilosophy) where he declares:\n\n\nNow things may be considered, that is, be brought into account, either\nas internal accidents of our mind, in which manner we consider them\nwhen the question is about some faculty of the mind; or as species of\nexternal things, not as really existing, but appearing only to\nexist, or to have a being without us [emphasis added]. And in\nthis manner we are now to consider them. (Elements of Law\nII.7.1)\n\n\nIn spite of a pre-reflective disposition toward dualism, an explicit\nargument for an agnostic attitude with respect to the ultimate\nconstitution of reality is also characteristic of John Locke\n(1632\u20131704). Already in The Epistle to the Reader of\nAn Essay concerning Human Understanding (1690) he denounces\nrationalist metaphysics as a \u201cSanctuary of Vanity and\nIgnorance\u201d and declares in the first book of his Essay\nright at the outset:\n\n\nI shall not at present meddle with the physical consideration of the\nmind; or trouble myself to examine, wherein its essence consists, or\nby what motions of our spirits, or alterations of our bodies, we come\nto have any sensation by our organs, or any ideas in our\nunderstandings; and whether those ideas do in their formation,\nany, or all of them, depend on matter or no [emphasis added]:\nThese are speculations, which, however curious and entertaining, I\nshall decline. (Book I, chap. I, 2; see also II.XXI.73)\n\n\nInstead he restricts his investigation to the \u201cpurpose to\nenquire into the original, certainty, and extent of human\nknowledge\u201d (Essay I.I.2). Such an investigation\npresupposes an acquaintance with our own minds, and thus according to\nLocke the most pressing task is to understand the mind or the\nunderstanding itself. And because for Locke the sole material the mind\nhas the ability to process are ideas, the most pressing task if one\nwants to understand the possibility of knowledge is to give an account\nof \u201chow he [the mind] comes by them [the ideas]\u201d\n(Essay II.I.1). There is no need to go into the details of\nLocke\u2019s conception of how the mind gets ideas and what the\nunderstanding does with them in order to arrive at knowledge. Although\nhis description of these processes differs in some interesting ways\nfrom the model Hobbes proposes, in the end both Hobbes and Locke share\nthe view (1) that whatever we can know depends on our having ideas\nwhich must be somehow based in sensation, (2) that there must be some\nexternal cause (Hobbes) or some source of affection (Locke) which\ngives rise to sensory ideas, yet (3) ultimately we are ignorant about\nthe real constitution of these causes and these sources. What we know\nis the content and structure of our own ideas, although we have no\nreason to deny the existence of external objects and even assume that\nin some regards external objects resemble our ideas of them (in the\ncase of primary qualities).\n\nObviously it is mainly point (3) that is of importance for the\nquestion of whether dualism or idealism is involved in Locke\u2019s\nversion of the operations of the mind. Again, as in the case of\nHobbes, it seems that Locke\u2019s position is meant to be neutral\nagainst and compatible with all these alternatives and that he wishes\nto stay agnostic with respect to them. This is indicated especially\nwell by his theory of substance and his remarks concerning the limits\nof knowledge. Substances, Locke famously holds, \n\n\nare such combinations of simple Ideas, as are taken to represent\ndistinct particular things subsisting by themselves. (Essay\nII.XII.6) \n\n\nIf one analyzes our concept of a substance one\n\n\nwill find he has no other Idea of it at all, but only a Supposition of\nhe knows not what support of such qualities, which are capable of\nproducing simple Ideas in us. (Essay II.XXIII.2)\n\n\nThe reasons for this supposition are two: (1) we cannot make sense of\nthe concept of an unsupported quality or of ideas subsisting by\nthemselves, (2) we know from experience that \u201ca certain number\nof these simple Ideas go constantly together\u201d or \u201cexist\ntogether\u201d (Essay II.XXIII.2\u20133). Although Locke\nthinks of these reasons as totally compelling, he sees quite well that\nthey do not justify any claim as to what a substance or a thing really\nis, what its nature or constitution consists in. Thus he never gets\ntired of emphasizing that we only have a confused idea of substance (a\nclaim also made by Leibniz about three-quarters of our knowledge,\nalthough he held that we have a clear concept of what substance is),\nand repeats quite often (at least three times in Essay book\nII, chap. XXIII alone) that\n\n\nWhatever therefore be the secret, abstract nature of substance in\ngeneral, all the ideas we have of particular distinct sorts of\nsubstances, are nothing but several combinations of simple ideas,\nco-existing in such, though unknown, cause of their union, as makes\nthe whole subsist of itself. (Essay II.XXIII.6)\n\n\nHe restricts this agnostic attitude not just to corporeal substances\nor bodies but extends it to spiritual substances or minds as well:\n\n\nIt is plain then, that the idea of corporeal substance in matter is as\nremote from our conceptions and apprehensions, as that of spiritual\nsubstance or spirit; and therefore from our not having any notion of\nthe substance of spirit, we can no more conclude its non-existence,\nthan we can for the same reason deny the existence of body; it being\nas rational to affirm there is no body, because we have no clear and\ndistinct idea of the substance of matter, as to say there is no\nspirit, because we have no clear and distinct idea of the substance of\na spirit. (Essay II.XXIII.5)\n\n\nThis criticism of any metaphysical claims concerning the ultimate\nconstitution of reality is accompanied by a more general warning\nagainst the overstepping of the natural limits of our cognitive\nfaculties. According to Locke it is just a fact about human nature\nthat there are limits to the powers of the understanding. These powers\nare meant to be bestowed to us by God to an extent sufficient for us\nto know \u201cWhatever is necessary for the Conveniences of Life, and\nInformation of Virtue\u201d (Essay I.I.5; see also\nII.XXIII.12) but only to that extent. If therefore the nature and the\nconstitution of substances both corporeal and spiritual are beyond our\ncognitive grasp then we should take this to be a hint that God has set\nlimits to what we can know because he sees no reason for us to know\neverything. Even if the powers He endowed on us would be magnified\ninfinitely we still would remain clueless as to what substances really\nare because we still would be stuck in a world of qualities (this is\none way of reading Essay II.XXIII.12). Thus, in the end\nmetaphysical knowledge of any kind is meant to be beyond our reach.\nThis, however, is nothing we should be concerned about:\n\n\nFor, though the comprehension of our understandings comes exceeding\nshort of the vast extent of things; yet we shall have cause enough to\nmagnify the bountiful author of our being, for that proportion and\ndegree of knowledge he has bestowed on us, so far above all the rest\nof the inhabitants of this our mansion. (Essay I.I.5)\n\n\nFor Locke, ontological agnosticism is an expression of piety.\nLocke\u2019s position may be regarded as a theological expression of\nthe most fundamental epistemological motivation for idealism: no\nmatter how much we know about objects and at what level of detail, we\nstill know them only from our own, human point of view, but whether\nobjects exist beyond our experience of them is really none of our\nbusiness. But neither is Locke prepared to assert that only spirits or\nminds exist; that too would exceed the bounds of human knowledge.\n\nThe agnosticism with respect to the ultimate constitution of\nsubstances and things or of the fundamentum in re of\n\u201cthe ideas thereof\u201d characteristic of Hobbes and Locke is\nchallenged forcefully by George Berkeley (1685\u20131753), for whom\ntheir agnosticism becomes a form of skepticism and even impiety. In\nhis Treatise Concerning the Principles of Human Knowledge\n(1710) he raises doubts about whether an agnostic stance along the\nlines of Hobbes and Locke can be upheld consistently if one thinks\nabout the origin and the properties of ideas the way they do. Although\nin his Treatise Berkeley does not mention Hobbes at all and\naddresses Locke not by his name but by formulas like \u201cesteemed\nphilosopher\u201d and \u201clearned author\u201d (1710:\nIntroduction, \u00a711) very few times, it is abundantly clear that he\nwants to confront especially Locke with a painful choice: either his\nconception of a substance or a thing has \u201cno distinct meaning\nannexed to\u201d it (1710: Part I, \u00a717) and is nonsense, or he\nhas to endorse not just epistemological agnosticism but full-blown\nidealism or, in Berkeley\u2019s term, immaterialism. In other words,\nBerkeley\u2019s point is that Locke cannot afford to be agnostic with\nrespect to the metaphysical status of substances and things if he\nwants us to think of ideas as the immediate objects of human\nknowledge. Arthur Collier (1680\u20131732) would make a similar\nargument.\n\nBerkeley offers both epistemological and metaphysical arguments for\nhis immaterialism. His epistemological arguments begin from the\npremise that ideas and only ideas are the objects of human knowledge,\na presupposition that he at least considered uncontroversial. Although\nhis taxonomy of the different kinds of ideas deviate in ways that are\nnot of interest here from Locke\u2019s classification, he agrees with\nLocke that ideas exist only \u201cin the mind\u201d (1710: Part I,\n\u00a72). He takes the mind to be a \u201cperceiving, active\nbeing\u201d which itself is not \n\n\nany one of my ideas, but a thing entirely distinct from them, wherein\nthey exist or, which is the same thing, whereby they are perceived.\n(1710: Part I, \u00a72) \n\n\nFrom these stipulations he derives his most fundamental and famous\nclaim (1) that \u201cthe existence of an idea consists in being\nperceived\u201d (1710: Part I, \u00a72) or that \u201ctheir\nesse is percipi\u201d (1710: Part I, \u00a73) by\nthe perceiving, active mind. Already here Berkeley has the means in\nplace to cast into doubt the meaningfulness of the assumption that\nthere might exist unperceived objects or things. This is due to his\nrestriction of existence to what is perceivable or, even narrower, to\nwhat is perceived: If the only objects that exist for a\nmind\u2014whether it is my own mind or the mind of other human beings\nor the divine mind\u2014are ideas because there is nothing else that\ncan exist for the mind, then the very concept of something that exists\nbut is not for the mind or is unperceived is a contradiction in terms.\nThus if, as Berkeley supposes Locke does, one thinks of things as\nconsisting of collections of ideas, he asks how could one take a thing\nto be something other than ideas and nevertheless to exist? This\nquestion underlies Berkeley\u2019s confidence in what is often\nreferred to as his \u201cmaster argument\u201d, the argument that\none cannot conceive of anything existing unconceived because in trying\nto do so one is still conceiving of the object (1710: Part I,\n\u00a723). This seems open to the obvious objection that he is\nconfusing the content of a proposition (for example, \u201cThe earth\nmay still exist after the extinction of all conscious life\u201d)\nwith the act of entertaining (\u201cconceiving\u201d) such a\nproposition, which of course cannot take place except in a conscious\nbeing; but if he is already committed to the thought that objects of\nknowledge are nothing but ideas, it is at least understandable that he\nshould overlook this distinction.\n\nThe second conviction, also meant to be damaging to Locke\u2019s view\nabout substances, on which Berkeley rests his case in favor of\nidealism is the more strictly metaphysical claim (2) that \u201can\nidea can be like nothing but an idea\u201d (1710: Part I, \u00a78).\nAlthough this claim is initially put forward in the context of his\nwell-known criticism of Locke\u2019s primary-secondary-quality\ndistinction, it is equally relevant for his denial that there are\nthings \u201cwithout the mind\u201d. The reasoning on which this\nclaim is based seems to be the following: For two items to stand in\nthe relation of likeness they must have something in common. However,\nif an idea is mind-dependent and if ideas are all there is for the\nmind, then what is \u201cwithout the mind\u201d must be different in\nevery respect from an idea. Thus a relation of likeness cannot obtain\nbetween ideas \u201cin the mind\u201d and things \u201cwithout the\nmind\u201d. Berkeley puts this point quite bluntly by appealing to\nobservation:\n\n\nIf we look but ever so little into our thoughts, we shall find it\nimpossible for us to conceive a likeness except only between our\nideas. Again, I ask whether those supposed originals or external\nthings, of which our ideas are the pictures or representations, be\nthemselves perceivable or no? if they are, then they are\nideas, and we have gained our point; but if you say they are not,\nI appeal to any one whether it be sense, to assert a colour is like\nsomething which is invisible; hard or soft, like something which is\nintangible; and so of the rest. (1710: Part I, \u00a78)\n\n\nThere is a third metaphysical claim that is essential to both\nBerkeley\u2019s criticism of Locke and the idealistic position he is\ngoing to adopt for himself. This is the claim (3) that ideas are\npassive and causally inert, i.e., they can neither produce nor alter\nanother idea (1710: Part I, \u00a725). This claim he also purports to\nbase on observation:\n\n\nwhoever shall attend to his ideas, whether of sense or reflection,\nwill not perceive in them any power or activity; there is therefore no\nsuch thing contained in them. A little attention will discover to us\nthat the very being of an idea implies passiveness and inertness in\nit, insomuch that it is impossible for an idea to do any thing, or,\nstrictly speaking, to be the cause of any thing. (1710: Part I,\n\u00a725)\n\n\nPerhaps this is intended as an epistemological premise for an\nontological claim. Be that as it may, again the primary function of\nthis claim is to discredit a Lockean view according to which we have\nto think of the primary qualities of things\u2014which are contents\nof the most fundamental ideas we have of them\u2014as the causes of\nsensations or of sensory ideas. It is, however, also meant to support\nthe untenability of the assumption that agnosticism with respect to\nthe real existence of mind-independent things is a viable option for a\nbeliever in Locke\u2019s model of how and by what means we acquire\nknowledge of objects.\n\nBerkeley\u2019s criticism of Locke\u2019s theory concerning\nsubstances is not carried out for its own sake. On the contrary, it is\nmeant to establish what Berkeley thinks to be the unavoidable\nmetaphysical consequences of a position that takes ideas \u201cin the\nmind\u201d to be the only material for the operations of the mind in\nits acquisition of knowledge. These metaphysical consequences consist\nin a thoroughgoing idealism or \u201cimmaterialism\u201d with\nrespect to the nature and constitution of things or substances.\nBerkeley\u2019s way of establishing this result is open to many\nquestions. However, the basic outline of his overall argument can be\nsketched thus: If existence is restricted to ideas (and minds) and if,\nwhat is undoubtedly the case, things or substances exist, then things\nor substances must be ideas (or minds) too. Now, as Locke has\nconvincingly shown, we can have ideas of particular things or\nsubstances, e.g., gold and lead, humans and sheep, distinguished by\nour ideas of their various properties, but we have only a confused or\nobscure idea of substance in general, which we suppose to underlie\nwhatever collection of ideas we take to be a thing or a substance of\none kind or another. But if we cannot have any ideas of things or\nsubstances other than our ideas of their properties, which clearly\nexist in minds, then the only clear ideas of things that we have is as\nideas, and in that case, if they do not seem to exist in our own\nindividual, human minds, then things or substances must be ideas in\nsome other non-human, i.e., divine mind. This divine mind cannot be\nitself an idea because it must be conceived as an active principle\nthat can be the cause of ideas, a principle of which we can have no\nidea but only a \u201cnotion\u201d (1710: Part I, \u00a726,\n\u00a727). Therefore, the very fact that we take things or substances\nto be real commits us to the claim that things are ideal entities\nperceived by the mind of God. Idealism, one could say, is the only\ntenable basis for a realistic stance for Berkeley, but it leads to a\nrealism about minds, human and divine, rather than of what he always\ncalls material substance. And if one is to accept his\nre-interpretation of causality as a purported relation between ideas\nin terms of his theory of marks and signs, in particular his theory\nthat what we think of as ideas of objects are signs of (God\u2019s\nplan for) future possible ideas for us (cf. 1710: Part I, \u00a765\nf.), then one also has to agree to idealism. In Berkeley\u2019s view,\nthe only alternative to idealism is not materialism but\nskepticism.\n\nUp until the point at which he introduces the mind of God into his\nargument, all of Berkeley\u2019s epistemological considerations might\nbe thought of as expressions of the basic insight that we can only\nconceive of reality from our own point of view, which are then\nextended into full-blown idealism in order to avoid the whiff of\nagnosticism or skepticism and supplemented with the existence of a\ndivine mind in order to satisfy an ineliminable tendency to believe in\nthe existence of something more than one\u2019s own mind or even of\nhuman minds in general. We will later see that the tendency to\npreserve both the impulse to idealism and the conviction that there is\nsomething more than ordinary human minds by positing a more than human\nmind is characteristic of many versions of idealism until the end of\nits glory days at the beginning of the twentieth century. This\ntendency is decidedly absent from the philosophy of David Hume,\nhowever.\n\nArthur Collier was a much more obscure clergyman than Berkeley. He\npublished his Clavis Universalis: Or, A New Inquiry after Truth,\nBeing a Demonstration of the Non-Existence, or Impossibility, of an\nExternal World in 1713, the same year that Berkeley\u2019s\nPrinciples of Human Knowledge appeared, and three years after\nBerkeley\u2019s Three Dialogues; however, he states that he\nhad originally conceived his position a decade earlier, so before he\ncould have read Berkeley. Although the work was not widely read, it\nwas translated into German by Johann Christian Eschenbach in 1756, and\nthen noticed by Thomas Reid and following him Dugald Stewart. It was\nrepublished in English in 1837 along with Collier\u2019s other\nphilosophical work, A Specimen of True Philosophy, in a\ncollection of Metaphysical Tracts edited by Samuel Parr, and\nthen again in 1909, edited with an introduction by Ethel Bowman. By\n\u201cexternal\u201d Collier meant \u201cindependent, absolute, or\nself-existent\u201d, and his position is that \u201call matter,\nbody, extension, &c.\u201d (which he also frequently calls\n\u201cexpansion\u201d) depends \u201con mind, thought, or\nperception, and that it is not capable of an existence, which is not\nthus dependent\u201d (Collier 1713 [1909: 6]). Collier\u2019s\nposition is thus full-throated idealism, which he emphasizes is\nneither skepticism nor a denial that bodies exist, but the position\nthat \n\n\nsuch and such bodies, which are supposed to exist, do not exist\nexternally; or in universal terms, that there is no such thing as an\nexternal world. (1713 [1909: 9]) \n\n\nCollier argues for his idealism on both epistemological and more\npurely metaphysical ground. His work, although a footnote in the\nhistory of philosophy, is interesting precisely because it so clearly\nillustrates the dual strategies for arguing for idealism,\n\nCollier\u2019s most purely epistemological argument is that we are\nall familiar with (visual) experiences that are assumed to be of\nexternal objects but which do not differ from similar experiences\nwhich are clearly not of external objects, yet that there is no\ndiscernible difference between the latter and the former, thus that if\nthe latter are in or entirely dependent upon the mind, then so must be\nthe former. He uses examples such as those of imaginary beings,\nchimeras or centaurs (1713 [1909: 17]), which he supposes we\n(visually) represent just as vividly (his term, anticipating Hume) as\nother objects, secondary qualities (1713 [1909: 21\u20132]), cases of\ndouble vision, cases of experiences which change, such as different\nphases of the moon, when no one would believe that the external\nobjects is changing (1713 [1909: 33]), and mirror images, which\neveryone believes exist in the mind, not in the piece of glass outside\nus, and yet are indiscernible from other images of their objects. He\nalso equates being visible with being \u201cpresent to the\nmind\u201d, and asks how something could be present to the mind if it\nwere elsewhere from the mind? (1713 [1909: 35]). He infers that to be\nvisible is to be in or dependent upon the mind, and thus that to be\noutside of the mind would necessarily be to be invisible (1713 [1909:\n56]).\n\nThis begins the more purely metaphysical part of Collier\u2019s\nargument: that to be visible is to be in the mind we can consider an\nepistemological premise, but then he argues that nothing can be both\nvisible and invisible at the same time, which is of course quite true\nindependently of epistemology. A further argument he makes is that\nsince God can give created minds any ideas directly, it would be\nneedless for him to give us our ideas indirectly, by creating\nindependent objects to cause ideas in us, and God does nothing useless\n(1713 [1909: 60\u20132]). This is a metaphysical, in this case\ntheological argument, directed against the occasionalists Nicholas\nMalebranche and his English follower John Norris rather than against\nLocke. The most interesting of Collier\u2019s metaphysical arguments\nfor idealism, however, take the form of antinomies, and have sometimes\nbeen held to anticipate Kant\u2019s first and second antinomies\n(Bowman in Collier [1713] 1909: xxiv). Collier argues that there are\nsound arguments that an external world must be both finite and\ninfinite in \u201cexpanse\u201d or extension (1713 [1909: 63]), that\nit must be both finitely and infinitely divisible (1713 [1909: 68]),\nand that it must both be in motion as a whole and have moveable parts,\nbut also cannot be either of these (1713 [1909: 78]). Since the\nconcept of an external world is in these ways contradictory, such a\nthing cannot exist. It is striking, however, that Collier does not\nactually provide the arguments for what would become the theses and\nantitheses of Kant\u2019s first two antinomies, instead providing\nonly a version of Zeno\u2019s paradox to prove the impossibility of\nmoving parts within an extended universe, an antinomy that Kant dos\nnot take over. \n\nIt is not inconceivable that Kant knew of Collier\u2019s work through\nEschenbach\u2019s translation, although there is no direct evidence\nfor that. It is more likely that Collier\u2019s argument that the\ndifference between what we ordinarily take to be a veridical\nperception and a mere imagination or hallucination is merely a matter\nof vividness, and that the latter can become as vivid as the former\nand thereby undermine any use of vividness as a criterion of\nexternality (1713 [1909: 19\u201320]), could have been known to Hume\nand influenced his formulation of the distinction between impressions\nand ideas in his Treatise of Human Nature (1739\u201340). So\nat this point we can turn to Hume.\n\nWhether or not David Hume (1711\u20131776) learned from Collier, he\nlearned a great deal from Berkeley, above all his empiricist\nepistemology, but for the most part he tried to avoid Berkeley\u2019s\noutright commitment to idealism. Hume\u2019s view that our knowledge\nconsists of our ideas, our recognition of \u201cphilosophical\u201d\nrelations among them, such as identity and difference, and our\nrecognition of \u201cnatural\u201d relations among them such as\ncausation, which are established by imagination and custom, could\nconstitute an epistemological ground for idealism\u2014causality, in\nparticular, which Hume regards as the basis of all our knowledge of\nexistence, is at the same time reduced to a way of feeling and\nthinking, in other words a state of mind. But depending on how he is\nread, Hume either accepts the skepticism about possible external\nobjects that Berkeley tries to avoid with his ontology that renders\nany external objects other than other human or divine minds\nimpossible, or else holds that even if there are valid arguments for\nskepticism it is psychologically impossible for human beings to remain\nin a skeptical frame of mind, thus we naturally even if not rationally\nbelieve in the existence of objects apart from our ideas of them.\nHowever, in those passages, prominently in Book I, Part IV of his\nearly Treatise of Human Nature (1739\u201340), where Hume\nentertains a kind of monism that sees both \u201cminds\u201d and\n\u201cobjects\u201d as nothing but different sets or\n\u201cbundles\u201d of one sort of thing, namely, perceptions,\nimpressions and their paler copies, ideas, his position might seem\nmuch like Berkeley\u2019s idealism, with the difference that while he\nreduces all reality to mental states like impressions and ideas he\ndoes not see these as properties that must inhere in substantial minds\nany more than in substantial bodies, both of which are fictions that\nwe introduce in order to explain continuities among those impressions\nor ideas (although it may be difficult to explain who is introducing\nthose fictions without resorting to substantial minds after all).\n\nHume\u2019s potentially idealist approach to causation is clearly on\nview in his 1748 Enquiry concerning Human Knowledge, which\nwas quickly translated into German and would eventually provide Kant\nwith the stimulus for his own aprioristic rather than empiricist\nargument for idealism with regard not only to causation but to all of\nwhat he called the categories of pure reason, including especially\nsubstance and interaction as well as causation. But since Kant was not\nfamiliar with the contents of Hume\u2019s earlier Treatise of\nHuman Nature, he did not know that Hume too had generalized his\napproach to causality to the cases of mind and body, nor did he know\nthat Hume may have tried to sidestep Berkeley\u2019s commitment to\nsubstances but not his idealism altogether by his theory of both minds\nand bodies as bundles of perceptions. Kant would try to avert\nBerkeley\u2019s version of idealism by a different stratagem, but\nbefore we come to that we must consider Hume\u2019s position more\nfully. Hume accepted from Locke and Descartes before him that the\nimmediate objects of consciousness are what they had called ideas,\nalthough he reserves that word for copies or subsequently recalled\nperceptions rather than the originally experienced perceptions that he\ncalls impressions. He also adopts the view of his predecessors that\nknowledge lies in the recognition of relations among impressions,\nideas, or both, and divides those relations into two kinds,\nphilosophical and natural. Philosophical relations are those\nimmediately evident on reflection on or comparison of particular\nideas, and include resemblance, identity, spatial and temporal\nrelations such as above and below or before and after, number and\ndegree, and logical contrariety (Hume 1739\u201340: I.I.5), while\nnatural relations are those that are not immediately evident on\nreflection on a single impression or idea or in a single comparison of\nany number, but which instead become evident, or more properly are\nformed, only through repeated experience. Hume\u2019s best known\nargument is then that causation is not a philosophical but a natural\nrelation: the causal relation is comprised by temporal succession,\nspatial contiguity, and necessary connection, and while the first two\nare philosophical relations that are immediately apparent, the\nnecessary connection between different ideas\u2014those of a cause\nand its separate effect\u2014is, unlike the necessary identity of two\nqualitatively similar ideas, not immediately apparent, as Hume puts\nit, to reason (1739\u201340: I.III.2), but instead grows only out of\nrepeated experience, the repeated experience of qualitatively similar\npairs of impressions which causes them to become linked in the mind,\nas we would ordinarily say, or at least in consciousness, as the\ncareful Hume should say at most (1739\u201340: I.III.6). In fact,\nHume\u2019s argument is that repeated experience itself has two\neffects: it creates a habit of thought such that upon the presentation\nof an impression of one kind that has repeatedly been experienced in\nspatial and temporal conjunction with one of another kind, a vivid\nversion of the idea of the kind of impression with which the first\nkind of impression has been repeatedly associated immediately\noccurs\u2014this is the essence of causal inference or belief,\nbecause a belief is nothing but an idea that is almost as vivid and\nforceful as the impression of which it was once a copy (1739\u201340:\nI.III.7\u20138; this is the thought Hume could have learned from\nArthur Collier)\u2014and further, there is an actual feeling of the\nmind (as we would ordinarily say) being tugged from the one impression\nto the other idea\u2014this is the basis of the idea of necessary\nconnection, a connection which the mind then \u201cspreads\u201d\nupon its objects to form the idea of a necessary connection among them\nor their states (1739\u201340: I.III.14).\n\nHume\u2019s theory of causation points toward idealism by relocating\nthe relation of causation from the external objects where we would\nordinarily suppose it to obtain to the mind, which we would ordinarily\nsuppose knows but does not constitute the relation known. In\nHume\u2019s words,\n\n\nTho\u2019 the several resembling instances, which give rise to the\nidea of power, have no influence on each other, and can never produce\nany new quality in the object, which can be a model of that\nidea [of power or causation], yet the observation of this\nresemblance produces a new impression in the mind, which is\nits real model\u2026. Necessity, then, is the effect of this\nobservation, and is nothing but an internal impression of the mind, or\na determination to carry our thoughts from one object to another.\n(1739\u201340: I.III.14, para. 20)\n\n\nSeveral things may be noted about this theory. For one, if it had been\nHume\u2019s intent to raise a general skepticism about causation,\nbased on the famous worry about induction that he himself raises,\nespecially in the subsequent Enquiry, namely that an\nassertion of causality claims that future impressions will occur in\nthe same patterns as past ones but there is no basis \u201cin\nreason\u201d for assuming that the future will resemble the past,\nthen the relocation of causation from the domain of objects to the\ndomain of the mind should make no difference, because we have no more\nreason to believe that the mind will behave the same way in the future\nas it has in the past than we do to believe that about anything else.\nSo we must either believe that Hume is very confused, not realizing\nthat his skepticism about induction as applied to external objects\nmust undermine our confidence in his application of induction to the\nmind itself, or else that he is very arch, and that he means us to do\nhis skeptical work for him by carrying over skepticism about induction\nto the case of the mind itself, or else that he is not really worrying\nabout issues of justification and thus of the threat of skepticism at\nall, but just means to be giving a plausible description of\nthe only possible basis for causal inference, namely the mind\u2019s\nexperience of itself. The last possibility may well seem to be the\nmost plausible, leading to the \u201cnaturalist\u201d reading of\nHume promoted by Norman Kemp Smith, Barry Stroud, and Don Garrett\nrather than the \u201cskeptical\u201d reading of Hume accepted by\nHume\u2019s contemporaries such as James Beattie and Thomas Reid and\ndefended recently and more skillfully by Robert Fogelin.\n\nThere is a further issue with Hume\u2019s treatment of causation that\nis largely suppressed in the Enquiry but that was evident in\nthe Treatise, namely, that although, as we saw in the last\npassage quoted, Hume sometimes describes necessary connection as being\ndisplaced from the object to the mind, on his own\nstrict interpretation of empiricism there is a problem in positing the\nexistence of either objects or minds distinct from perceptions. This\nis what pushes Hume towards his own form of idealism. That is,\nalthough we naturally speak of perceptions as being of\nobjects and in or by the mind, on the view that all\nknowledge is founded on perception and that in perception we are\nimmediately acquainted with nothing but perceptions, it becomes\nproblematic how we could have knowledge either of the mind itself or\nof any object of perceptions distinct from those perceptions. Hume\nputs the former point succinctly by arguing that we have no perception\nof the self distinct from our perception of its perceptual states:\n\n\nFor my part, when I enter most intimately into what I call\nmyself, I always stumble on some particular perception or\nother, of heat or cold, light or shade, love or hatred, pain or\npleasure. I can never catch myself at any time without a\nperception, and never can observe any thing but the perception.\n(1739\u201340: I.IV.6.3)\n\n\nHe then argues that in fact the self is\n\n\nnothing but a bundle of different perceptions, which succeed each\nother with an inconceivable rapidity, and are in a perpetual flux and\nmovement. (1739\u201340: I.IV.6.4)\n\n\nand that the idea of a continuous self is but a fiction or illusion\ncreated by relations of resemblance and continuity among perceptions\nin the bundle, just as both the idea of and belief in causal\nconnection were created by repetition of pairs of impressions. Without\nsaying that the objects of perception are also nothing but bundles of\nrelated perceptions, Hume presents a similar account of how the idea\nof objects distinct from our perceptions of them is generated by our\nimpression of continuity among perceptions: although only philosophers\nreflect on this, in fact we know that perceptions are fleeting and\ntransitory; we mistake continuity among them for enduring identity;\nand we then invent something other than perceptions, something not\nfleeting and transitory, to which to ascribe that enduring identity\n(1739\u201340: I.IV.2). In neither case, however, do we actually have\na clear idea of any object or substance distinct from our perceptions:\nwe do not have such an idea of external objects or their substance,\nbut neither do we have a clear idea of the mind or its substance. The\nonly ideas we have are copies of our impressions, or perceptions.\n\nHume\u2019s attack on the supposition that we have an idea of the\nmind as distinct from its impressions thus constitutes a rejection of\nBerkeley\u2019s commitment to the existence of mental substances, but\nnot of idealism altogether. On Hume\u2019s account, we are not\nentitled to assert the existence of both ideas and the minds, human or\ndivine, that have them, but only the existence of the former. At the\nsame time, he does not seem to think that we are forced into\nskepticism about either minds or external objects by his approach,\nthat is, into a position that there may really be minds and external\nobjects but we cannot know that fact or their real qualities; yet he\nstill has a lingering worry that although there are psychological\nmechanisms leading us to form the fictions of minds and bodies beyond\nperceptions, we do not really know what we are talking about when we\ntalk about such things, and thus cannot even coherently doubt whether\nwe have knowledge of them\u2014our talk about them is explicable but\nmeaningless. Hume thus seems to end up with an uneasy compromise\nbetween idealism and agnosticism.\n4. Kant\n\nThe first major philosopher actually to call himself an idealist was\nImmanuel Kant (1724\u20131804), although as soon as he did so he\nlabored to distinguish his position from Berkeley\u2019s by calling\nhis position empirical realism combined with transcendental idealism,\nby which he means that space and time are ineliminable properties of\nour experience and of things as they appear to us but not real\nproperties of things as they are in themselves. However, since Kant\nneither denies the existence of things independent from our\nrepresentations of them nor asserts that these things must be mental\nin nature, the transcendental idealist part of his position cannot be\nstraightforwardly identified with idealism as he understood it or as\nwe are understanding it here, namely, as the position that reality is\nultimately mental in nature. While Kant thinks that he has given a\nsound argument for the transcendental ideality of space and time, he\nthinks he has given no reason at all to question the existence of\nthings independent from our representations of them.\n\nThe sources as well as the form of Kant\u2019s position are complex.\nKant was deeply impressed by what he knew of Leibniz (many of the\ntexts that are crucial to later understandings of Leibniz, such as\n\u201cPrimary Truths\u201d, having been unknown in Kant\u2019s\ntimes, or others, such as the New Essays on Human\nUnderstanding, having been published only when he was well into\nhis career) and the view that space and time are phaenomena bene\nfundata as well as by what he knew of Hume and his view that\ncausation is a form of thinking that we impose upon our experience\nrather than something we directly experience. He was more generally\nimpressed by the empiricist argument that our knowledge of objects\ndepends upon experience of them. However, he thought that both the\nLeibnizian and the Humean approaches failed to account for the\npossibility of synthetic a priori knowledge, that is,\nknowledge that goes beyond the mere analysis of concepts, that thus\ndoes more than merely unpack explicit or tacit definitions, but yet\nlegitimately claims universal and necessary validity. But, unlike\nPlato, the original apriorist avant la lettre, he does not\nsee synthetic a priori knowledge as leading to realism about\nobjects having the features that we know a priori, nor, like\nMalebranche, the theological Platonist, does he see such knowledge as\nknowledge of the mind of God; rather, he sees it as providing the\nconclusive argument for the idealist aspect of his position through\nthe premise that we can only know to be necessary and therefore\nuniversally valid the forms that we ourselves impose upon our\nexperience. Thus precisely because we have a priori knowledge\nof space and time, in his view they can be only features of our own\nrepresentations of things, not properties or relations of those things\nas they are in themselves. At the same time, even though when he wrote\nhis main works he was not well-informed on the aporia about subjects\nand objects about which Hume had ultimately thrown up his arms in the\nTreatise, which has here been characterized as the tension in\nHume between agnosticism and idealism, Kant recognized that we cannot\ntalk about what he called appearances without conceding the real\nexistence of subjects to which objects appear as well as the objects\nthat appear to such subjects. Kant was thus led to what he called\n\u201ctranscendental idealism\u201d, a position that combines\nidealism about the main forms of objects, that is, the view that we\nourselves impose spatiality, temporality, substantiality, causality,\nand other forms upon our experience and precisely because we know\nthese forms a priori cannot regard them as also the real\nforms of objects independent of ourselves, with a kind of ontological\nrealism, the view that in some sense both our selves and our objects\nreally do exist independently of our representations of them. Although\nhe identifies his own \u201ctranscendental idealism\u201d with\n\u201cempirical realism\u201d he does not want to call his own\nposition \u201ctranscendental realism\u201d, because for him that\nwould be the view that objects independent of our representations do\nexist with the forms that we represent them as having; that\nis, in Kant\u2019s terms, transcendental realism would be the view\nthat things really are spatial and temporal independently of our\nrepresenting them as such. Neither would he even be happy to call this\nconception of things in themselves a kind of idealism, because it is\npart of his position that, at least from what he calls a theoretical\npoint of view, we cannot suppose that even our own minds are\nreally as they appear to us, nor can we assert that the reality that\nultimately underlies the appearance of minds is essentially different\nfrom the reality that ultimately underlies the appearance of bodies.\nYet he remains confident that we are entitled to assert the existence\nof some sort of reality underlying the appearance of both minds and\nbodies. And to make matters even more complicated, he is confident\nthat we can rationally believe both ourselves and God to be\nmental in nature from what he calls a \u201cpractical\u201d point of\nview, that is, as necessary presuppositions of rationally attempting\nto do what morality commands. A complete characterization of\nKant\u2019s position would thus be empirical realism about\nspace, time, causation, and the other categories, transcendental\nidealism about space and time but combined with\nrealism about the existence of things in themselves,\nand now practical idealism about the nature of ourselves as\nthings in themselves and the nature of God, as in both cases\nessentially mental or spiritual. \n\nKant had already published a number of substantial scientific as well\nas philosophical works before the \u201cgreat light\u201d of\ntranscendental idealism came to him in 1769, leading to his first\nstatement of it the following year in his inaugural dissertation,\nOn the Forms and Principles of the Sensible and Intelligible\nWorlds (1770). But it would then take him another decade, the\nso-called \u201csilent decade\u201d, to publish his full argument\nfor transcendental idealism in the first edition of the Critique\nof Pure Reason, which appeared in 1781, and even then the\nrelation between the empirical realism and transcendental idealism\nthat he developed in that work continued to vex him: the first\nsubstantial review of the book in 1782 charged him with Berkeleianism,\nin other words, with idealism, and Kant then tried to rebut that\naccusation in his attempted popularization of the Critique,\nthe Prolegomena to Any Future Metaphysics of 1783, and to\nfurther defend that rebuttal of ordinary idealism in the\n\u201cRefutation of Idealism\u201d that he added to the second\nedition of the Critique of Pure Reason in 1787. Even then he\nwas not done with the subject, as we know from a dozen further drafts\nof the \u201cRefutation\u201d that he composed after that\nsecond edition of the Critique. Indeed, Kant continued to\nstruggle with the clarification of his own position to the end of his\nlife, attempting a restatement of transcendental idealism in the\nuncompleted material for a final book that has come down to us under\nthe name of the Opus postumum. But since it was Kant\u2019s\npresentations of his position in the two editions of the\nCritique and the Prolegomena that were most\ninfluential in his own time and have been since, we shall concentrate\non those texts here. It was in these texts that Kant attempted to\nperfect his combination of empirical realism about space, time, and\nthe categories, transcendental idealism with regard to space and time,\nand yet realism (agnosticism) about the actual existence of things\ndistinct from our representations of them. It was then primarily in\nhis writings in moral philosophy, above all the Critique of\nPractical Reason of 1788, that he developed what we have called\nhis practical idealism about the real nature of the self and God. The\nsecond half of Kant\u2019s third and final critique, namely, the\nCritique of Teleological Judgment in the Critique of the Power of\nJudgment, uses Kant\u2019s complex position to justify the\nrevival of a teleological approach to nature that would seem to have\nalready been outmoded in Kant\u2019s time, but that will lie beyond\nthe purview of the present article (see Guyer 2005).\n\nKant\u2019s arguments for his transcendental idealism are distributed\nacross all parts of his Critique of Pure Reason. He gives a\ndirect argument for it in the Transcendental Aesthetic, supplemented\nby the Transcendental Analytic, and he gives an indirect argument for\nit in the Transcendental Dialectic by arguing that only his\ntranscendental idealism can allow us to avoid the paradoxes or\nconfusions of traditional metaphysics. We will comment first on\nKant\u2019s direct argument for transcendental idealism and then on\nhis indirect argument for it through the critique of traditional\nmetaphysics.\n\nThe direct argument is based on Kant\u2019s claim, substantiated in\nthe Transcendental Aesthetic, that we necessarily represent space and\ntime and objects in them by means of our a priori\nrepresentations of space and time, which are thus pure forms for the\nintuition of particular objects, and that we can construct proofs of\ntheorems about space and time by appeal to our a priori\nrepresentations or in \u201cpure intuition\u201d. But how does this\nlead to any form of idealism? Kant\u2019s chief argument is that\nspace and time can represent\n\n\nno property at all of any things in themselves nor any relations of\nthem to each other, i.e., no determination of them that attaches to\nobjects themselves and that would remain even if one were to abstract\nfrom all subjective conditions of intuition,\n\n\nand that space and time themselves can instead be only our\na priori representations of them and the spatial and temporal\nfeatures of objects in space and time only features of our\nrepresentations of them or of the \u201cappearances\u201d of\nobjects, because\n\n\nneither absolute nor relative determinations can be intuited prior to\nthe existence of the things to which they pertain, thus be intuited\na priori. (A 26/B 42)\n\n\nThe decisive point of this argument is the following: although because\nof our forms of intuition our particular representations\nnecessarily have spatio-temporal structure, any objects that\nhad that structure independently of our so representing them\nwould at best have such structure contingently, and thus the\nsupposedly synthetic a priori propositions about space, time,\nand their mathematics would not be necessarily true\nthroughout their domain. This argument thus exploits the key\nepistemological premise for idealism, namely that any isomorphism\nbetween knowledge and the known must be necessary. Kant is arguing\nthat since we have no ground to assert a necessary isomorphism between\nthe spatio-temporal structure of our experience and the\nspatio-temporal structure in things as they are in themselves, we must\ndeny the latter altogether. Kant makes this key move several times. In\nthe Critique, he poses the rhetorical question,\n\n\nIf there did not lie in you a faculty for intuiting a priori;\nif this subjective condition were not at the same time the universal\na priori condition under which alone the object\nof\u2026intuition is possible; if the object ([e.g.,] the triangle)\nwere something in itself without relation to your subject: then how\ncould you say that what necessarily lies in your subjective conditions\nfor constructing a triangle must also necessarily pertain to the\ntriangle in itself. (A 48/B 65)\n\n\nSimilarly, in the Prolegomena he writes that\n\n\nPure mathematics, and especially pure geometry, can have objective\nreality only under the single condition that it refers merely to\nobjects of the senses, with regard to which objects, however, the\nprinciple remains fixed, that our sensory representation is by no\nmeans a representation of things in themselves, but only of the way in\nwhich they appear to us,\n\n\nfor on the contrary supposition\n\n\nit absolutely would not follow from the representation of [e.g.]\nspace, a representation that serves a priori, with all the\nvarious properties of space, as foundation for the geometer, that all\nof this, together with what is deduced from it, must be exactly so in\nnature. The space of the geometer would [or could] be taken for mere\nfabrication and credited with no objective validity, because it is\nsimply not to be seen how things would have to agree necessarily with\nthe image that we form of them by ourselves and in advance. (\u00a713,\nNote I, 4:287)\n\n\nSo, Kant concludes, in order to be necessarily true throughout their\ndomain, the synthetic a priori propositions about space and\ntime\u2014and this includes not just the specific propositions of\ngeometry or mathematics more generally but also the general\npropositions derived in the metaphysical expositions, such as that\nspace and time are infinite singular wholes with parts rather than\ninstances\u2014must be true only of the representations on which we\nimpose our own forms of intuition, and cannot be true of things as\nthey are in themselves. This is Kant\u2019s chief argument for\ntranscendental idealism, the view that the way things appear to us\nessentially reflects our cognitive capacities rather anything\nintrinsic to them, combined with what we could call theoretically\nindeterminate ontological realism, the view that there are things\nindependent of our representations of them but because our most\nfundamental ways of representing things cannot be true of them we\ncannot know anything about them other than this fact\nitself\u2014until, that is, Kant brings his practical argument for\nour own ultimately mental nature and the mental nature of God on\nboard.\n\nIn a passage added to the second edition of the Critique,\nKant also points out that by arguing for the \u201ctranscendental\nideality\u201d of spatio-temporality\u2014that it is a necessary\nfeature of our representations of things but not a feature of things\nas they are in themselves at all\u2014he does not mean to degrade\nspace to a \u201cmere illusion\u201d, as did \u201cthe good\nBerkeley\u201d (B 71): his position is that it is a subjective but\nnecessary feature of our way of representing things, similar to\nsecondary qualities such as color or fragrance (B 70n) in being\nsubjective but unlike them in being necessary (see also A 29/B 45),\nand he thinks that by failing to see that the spatiality (in\nparticular) of our representations is necessary, Berkeley has\nunnecessarily \u201cdemoted\u201d it to a mere illusion.\nKant\u2019s larger objection to the charge that his position is not\ndifferent from Berkeley\u2019s is, however, that while denying the\nspatiality and temporality of things as they are in themselves, he has\nprovided no reason to deny that there are things distinct from our\nrepresentations of them and our own minds as representing them. But\nsince this larger objection is most clearly expounded and defended in\nthe Prolegomena and the \u201cRefutation of Idealism\u201d\nadded to the second edition of the Critique, which is\ninserted into the Transcendental Analytic, discussion of it can be\ndeferred for now.\n\nKant does not need to mount a separate argument for transcendental\nidealism in the Transcendental Analytic, because while that is aimed\nat showing that the use of certain concepts (the categories of pure\nunderstanding) and principles (the principles of pure understanding)\nare necessary conditions of any cognition of objects at all, indeed of\nself-consciousness (apperception) itself, but also yield knowledge\nonly when applied to intuitions, pure intuitions in the case of pure\nmathematical cognition and empirical intuitions in the case of\neverything else (thus Kant\u2019s famous statement \u201cWithout\nsensibility no object would be given to us, and without understanding\nnone would be thought. Thoughts without content are empty, intuitions\nwithout concepts are blind\u201d, A 51/B 75), since empirical\nintuitions have already been shown to yield appearances rather than\nthings in themselves, it automatically follows that the categories and\nprinciples of pure understanding will also yield cognition only of\nappearances. Nevertheless, Kant reaffirms transcendental idealism\nduring the course of the Transcendental Analytic.\n\nThe Transcendental Dialectic, the second half of the Critique of\nPure Reason in which Kant provides the critique of traditional\nmetaphysics is explicitly intended to give an indirect proof of\ntranscendental idealism (B xx). Specifically, the middle section of\nthe Dialectic, entitled \u201cThe Antinomy of Pure Reason\u201d, is\nsupposed to provide this indirect proof. All three sections of the\nDialectic, thus the preceding \u201cParalogisms of Pure Reason\u201d\nand the following \u201cIdeal of Pure Reason\u201d, are supposed to\nshow that the faculty of reason\u2019s inevitable conception of the\n\u201cunconditioned\u201d, that which is a condition for everything\nelse but itself has no condition, can never provide knowledge of any\nobject because knowledge requires intuition as well as concept, and\nintuition is always conditioned\u2014the representation of any region\nof space is conditioned by more surrounding it, and that of any region\nof time is likewise conditioned by the representation of more time\nbefore and after it. Reason can form \u201ctranscendental\nideas\u201d, more properly, \u201ctranscendent concepts\u201d (A\n327/B 384), that is, the ideas of an unconditioned subject (the self\nas substance), an unconditioned whole of all things and events (a\ncompleted world-whole), and an unconditioned ground of all possibility\n(God) (A 334/B 393). These ideas, according to Kant, may be useful as\nguidelines for scientific research and even necessary for the purposes\nof practical reason, but they outrun the limits of intuition and\ntherefore theoretical cognition. This general claim itself does not\nentail transcendental idealism, that is, it does not identify space\nand time with our own forms of intuition. However, Kant\u2019s claim\nis that the paradoxes diagnosed in the \u201cAntinomy of Pure\nReason\u201d can only be resolved on the basis of transcendental\nidealism. In the case of the first two antinomies he argues that both\nsides essentially concern space and time or the things in them (these\nare the arguments that as we saw were missing from Arthur\nCollier\u2019s anticipation of the first two antinomies), and that\nsince space and time as forms of intuition are indefinitely\nextendable and divisible, both sides of the debates, the theses and\nthe antitheses, are false: space and time and thus the totality of\nthings and events in them (the world) are neither bounded and finite\nor unbounded and infinite but indefinite (even though particular\nthings within space or periods within time may have determinate\nboundaries). In the case of the third and fourth antinomies, however,\nKant argues that the distinction between appearances and things in\nthemselves that is at the heart of transcendental idealism makes it\npossible for both sides to be considered true, since they concern\ndifferent objects: in the empirical world of experience, there are\nonly ever indefinitely extending chains of causes and effects, each\nmoment of which is necessary relative to its causal laws (the third\nantithesis) but contingent because no antecedent cause is absolutely\nnecessary or necessary considered in itself, but outside of the\nempirical world there is nothing to prevent there being an absolutely\nnecessary thing in itself (God) nor acts of absolute spontaneity on\nthe part of that absolutely necessary being or even lesser beings,\nsuch as finite agents. Thus, Kant argues that the antitheses of the\nthird and fourth antinomies are actually true of the world as it\nappears, while the theses of these two antinomies are possibly true of\nthings in themselves, namely of God as the ground of the entire world\nof appearance and of ourselves as spontaneous agents grounding our own\nappearances of action. Again, Kant\u2019s ultimate claim will be that\nwe have necessary and sufficient practical grounds for\naffirming both our own freedom and the existence of God, but these do\nnot yield theoretical cognition (B xxx).\n\nKant\u2019s antinomies led to the dialectical methods of Fichte,\nSchelling, and Hegel, and were thus to prove immensely influential.\nBut it was clearly controversial whether the antinomies in fact\nrequired the distinction between appearances and things in themselves;\nHegel, for example, surely thought not. For the argument that only\ntranscendental idealism can resolve the antinomies seems to be\ncircular: unless one assumes that our representations of\nspace and time give us not only reliable but also complete information\nabout the nature of space and time and all things in them, there is no\nreason to assume that the limits of our representations of\nspace and time\u2014their indefiniteness and the contingency of any\nstarting- or stopping-point in them\u2014are also in fact true of\nspace and time and everything in them in themselves. Kant\u2019s\nindirect proof for transcendental idealism therefore is not conclusive\n(see Guyer 1987: chapter 18).\n\nKant himself did not think so, of course. He was utterly committed to\ntranscendental idealism. When confronted with the challenge that\ntranscendental idealism was nothing but Berkeleianism, however, that\nis, the reduction of all reality to ideas and the minds that have\nthem, he recoiled. This objection was made in the first substantial\nreview of the first edition of the Critique, written from an\nempiricist point of view by Christian Garve and then redacted by J.H.\nFeder in 1782 (Garve-Feder 1782, Garve 1783, in Sassen 2000,\npp. 53\u20138, 59\u201377).  Kant defended himself by a more precise\nformulation of his doctrine in the Prolegomena (1783) and\nfurther by the insertion of a \u201cRefutation of Idealism\u201d,\nspecifically \u201cmaterial idealism\u201d, into the Transcendental\nAnalytic in the second edition of the Critique\n(1787). Kant\u2019s claim in the\nProlegomena is that his position should be called\n\u201cformal\u201d or \u201ccritical\u201d idealism rather than\n\u201cmaterial\u201d idealism because it merely identifies space and\ntime with our forms of intuition but does not otherwise deny the\nreality of the objects in space and time. As he puts it:\n\n\nThere are things given to us as objects of our senses existing outside\nus, yet we know nothing of them as they may be in themselves, but are\nacquainted only with their appearances, i.e., with the representations\nthat they produce in us because they affect our senses. Accordingly, I\nby all means avow that there are bodies outside us, i.e., things\nwhich, though completely unknown to us as to what they may be in\nthemselves, we know through the representations which their influence\non our sensibility provides for us, and to which we give the name of a\nbody\u2014which word therefore merely signifies the appearance of\nthis object that is unknown to us but is nonetheless real. Can this be\ncalled idealism? It is the very opposite of it. (4:288\u20139)\n\n\nAt this stage, Kant\u2019s response to the identification of his\nposition with traditional ontological idealism is basically\nincredulity: he cannot understand it because in his view he has only\ngiven reasons for removing space and time from things to our\nrepresentations of them, just as earlier philosophers had given\n(different) reasons for relocating properties like color from object\nto subject, but has provided no arguments against the existence of\nthose things themselves, which he, like any other sane person, takes\nfor granted.\n\nBy the time of the second edition of the Critique, however,\nKant must have come to see the need for a positive defense of the\nassumption of the existence of things in themselves that ground our\nspatio-temporal representations of body (although, since those things\nin themselves are not supposed to be spatio-temporal and causality is\nsupposed to be a spatio-temporal relation, they cannot precisely be\nsaid to cause our spatio-temporal representations).\nKant\u2019s argument\u2014which in the following years he would\nattempt to improve a dozen times (see Guyer 1983, Guyer 1987: Part IV, and Kant\n2005)\u2014is that we can only achieve \u201cempirically determined\nconsciousness\u201d of our own existence, or a determinate temporal\nordering of our own representations, by correlating them with\nsomething enduring outside of and distinct from them:\n\n\nThe perception of this persistent thing is possible only through a\nthing outside me and not through the mere\nrepresentation of a thing outside me. (B 275)\n\n\nSpatiality may be acknowledged to be only my way of\nrepresenting things outside me, but insofar as anything in\nspace is used to determine the order of my own representations it must\nbe regarded as being ontologically distinct from my representations of\nit even if its phenomenology is subjective, that is, even if\nspatiality is only our way of representing ontological independence\n(see A 22/B 37). In this way Kant proves, contra Berkeley who denies\nit and Descartes who doubts it, that our phenomenologically spatial\nrepresentations are \u201cgrounded\u201d in something ontologically\ndistinct from those representations. Kant\u2019s\n\u201cRefutation\u201d was intended precisely to demonstrate that\ntranscendental idealism, the argument that our most basic forms of\nknowledge in fact reflect only our own forms of intuition and\nconceptualization, could and must be combined with indeterminate\nontological realism, that is, assurance of the existence of objects\nindependent of our representations of them combined with ignorance of\ntheir nature, other than their non-spatio-temporality.\n\nIt may well be asked of Kant\u2019s \u201cRefutation of\nIdealism\u201d, as it had already been asked of his yet-to-be-named\ntranscendental idealism in 1770 by such distinguished contemporaries\nas Johann Heinrich Lambert, Johann Georg Sulzer, and Moses\nMendelssohn, whether it is really compatible with the transcendental\nideality of time, that is, whether it does not presuppose the\nreality of the temporality of the enduring object it proposes by means\nof which to determine the sequence of our own representations as well\nas of the self that has that sequence of representations (isn\u2019t\nthe sequence of representations, they essentially asked, really a\nsequence?). But we will not further pursue that question here, because\nall of Kant\u2019s successors were more concerned with the viability\nof Kant\u2019s general distinction between appearances and things in\nthemselves rather than with the specifics of Kant\u2019s argument for\ntranscendental idealism from a priori knowledge or of\nKant\u2019s proof that we can assert the existence of things in\nthemselves in spite of that distinction. This concern began with the\nfamous objection of F.H. Jacobi, made in the appendix to his 1787 book\non David Hume, that without the assumption of things in themselves he\ncould not enter into the critical system, but that with it he could\nnot remain within the system; that is, he felt that once the\ndistinction between appearances and things in themselves was made all\nground for the assumption of the existence of things other than our\nown representations was removed even if Kant had made no explicit\nargument against that existence. We will also not further explore what\nwe have called Kant\u2019s practical transcendental realism, that is,\nhis argument that morality requires us to believe that we have free\nwills and immortal souls and that there is an omniscient,\nomni-benevolent, and all-wise God, thus that those constituents of\nreality are essentially mental in nature. Rather, we now turn to\nKant\u2019s successors to see how they tried to save Kant\u2019s\ninsight into the idea that the most fundamental forms of knowledge\nultimately depend on fundamental operations of self-consciousness\nwithout ending up with Kant\u2019s combination of that with\nindeterminate ontological realism.\n5. German Idealism\n\nKant can thus be seen to have made two major points about\ntranscendental idealism. (1) Although he never questions the existence\nof something independent of our representations of it, he can claim to\nhave shown that when it comes to the ultimate constitution of this\nreality as it may be considered independently of the way it appears to\nbeings endowed with reason and (human) sensibility we can know nothing\non theoretical grounds; on practical grounds, as we have seen, he\ninsisted that we can rationally believe, for example, that we really\nare free. We neither can know whether\u2014to use a Hobbesian\nexpression again\u2014\u201cwithout us\u201d or\u2014to\nuse Kant\u2019s own term \u201cin itself\u201d\u2014there\nare material objects that consist of substances and their attributes\nstanding in spatio-temporal or other (e.g., causal) relations to each\nother and constituting a law-governed whole called nature. Nor can we\nknow whether whatever we experience as an object is in the end some\nmental product of a divine mind having creative powers totally\ndifferent from those of which we can make sense. Thus we are bound to\nbe agnostic with regard to any metaphysical theoretical claims as to\nthe real constitution of the world, and this implies that there is no\nway to convince us of either idealism or determinate realism about the\ncharacter of things in themselves. (2) However, whenever we talk about\nobjects of cognition, i.e., of objects that are addressed by us in\nterms of concepts and judgments, we have to accept them as being\nconceptual constructions based on our subjective forms of intuitions\nand on very specific conceptual rules for bringing together or\nunifying data: an object of cognition is that \u201cin whose\nconcept a manifold of what is given through sensibility is\nunited\u201d (Critique of Pure Reason, B 137). This means,\naccording to Kant, that the assumption of the conceptual constitution\nof objects of cognition is unavoidable. This is the part of his\nposition that Kant calls empirical realism.\n\nKant\u2019s Solomonic verdict was not much appreciated by the main\nrepresentatives of post-Kantian German idealism. Friedrich Heinrich\nJacobi, as already mentioned, immediately criticized Kant\u2019s\nallowance of things in themselves of unknown determinations, and\nreplaced it with a straightforward fideism about external existence\n(which he alleged to find in Hume\u2019s rejection of the\npsychological possibility of skepticism). However, the general\ntendency of the idealists, beginning with Johann Gottlieb Fichte, was\nto reject Kant\u2019s transcendental idealism by arguing that there\nis no real opposition between what is traditionally taken to be a\nsubject-independent world that is present to us in the mode of\n\u201cgivenness\u201d and \u201cbeing\u201d and a world that is\nconceived of as subject-dependent in that it is formed by conceptual\ntools or other \u201cthought-ingredients\u201d stemming from some\nsubjective activity or other. In other words, Kant\u2019s successors\nremoved his restriction of a necessary isomorphism between knowledge\nand the known to the case of appearances, and took it to be a general\nrelation between thought and being. This led to a new conception of\nidealism whose distinguishing character consists in the endorsement of\nthe claim of the \u201cinseparability of being and thinking\u201d\nwhere the term \u201cinseparability\u201d is meant to cover\nsometimes reciprocal dependence and sometimes strict identity. This\nconception was established primarily by epistemological considerations\nand realized by introducing entirely new ways of thinking about what\nultimately constitutes reality based on a dynamic conception of\nself-consciousness that the German idealists took to be at the heart\nof Kant\u2019s theory of the transcendental unity of apperception\n(and had been arrived at by Kant on the basis of\nepistemological, not: ontological, considerations!).\nAccording to this conception, reality has to be conceived as a result\nof an activity paradigmatically manifested in the unique manner in\nwhich consciousness of oneself arises. Reality is essentially mental,\nwhile the mental is essentially active. In order to find out the true\nnature of reality one has to gain insight into the operations of this\nactivity.\n\nThis approach to answering fundamental metaphysical questions by\ncasting into doubt the traditional distinction between ontology and\nepistemology not only leads to a different conception of what idealism\nis all about. Above all, it means that one has to sketch out the\ndifference between idealism and whatever is taken to be its opposite\n(realism, naturalism, materialism, sensualism etc.) not in terms of\ndifferent kinds of \u201cstuff\u201d either material or mental but\nto turn away from any \u201cmatter\u201d whatsoever. Rather,\nidealism is now defined in terms of the opposition between dynamic\nelements like activities and forces as the primary constituents of\nreality and more substantial items like material objects and\n(spiritual) persons. Idealism understood in this fashion becomes the\nname of a \u201cmetaphysical\u201d (in a non-traditional sense)\nworld-view that is opposed to what especially Fichte and Schelling\nliked to call \u201cdogmatism\u201d and is rooted in assumptions\nabout dynamic processes that are operative in the course of self- and\nobject-constitution. There is thus a fundamental difference between\nthe idealism of German idealism and the immaterialism of Berkeley:\nwhere Berkeley\u2019s idealism focused on ideas as the\n\u201cstuff\u201d of existence and assumed minds, whether human or\ndivine, as their repository, the German idealists focused on the mind\nas active and largely tried to suppress the traditional ontology of\nsubstances and their accidents within which Berkeley still worked,\nwhich Hume questioned but for which he supplied no alternative, and\nwhich Kant again defended by conceiving of substance and accident as\nrelational categories.\n\nAlthough overcoming the distinction between thought and being by\nrelying on self-relating activities might be seen as a common goal of\nall the major German idealistic thinkers, they pursued this project in\nvery different directions. The first post-Kantian philosopher who\nembarked explicitly on the project to elaborate a dynamic idealistic\nconception of reality that was based on what he took to be conditions\nof knowledge/cognition and agency and that was built on a specific\nconception of self-consciousness was Johann Gottlieb Fichte\n(1762\u20131814) while he was a professor at the university of\nSaxe-Weimar in Jena from 1794 to 1799. In his Doctrine of\nScience (1794/95) and in the First and Second\nIntroduction into the Doctrine of Science (1797) he famously set\nout to demonstrate that the primordial act of self-positing lies at\nthe basis of all reality as far as it is an object of\nknowledge/cognition and agency. His starting-point is an\nepistemological question: how does it come that we cannot help but\nexperience objective reality the way we do, i.e., in terms of\nspatio-temporal objects standing in determinate relations? Where do\nthese representations of objects, of relations and especially the\nbelief that they exist come from? And (most importantly): how can we\nhave knowledge of objective reality that is not subject to skeptical\ndoubts? In order to answer these questions Fichte pursues at different\ntimes different strategies. The best known and most influential of\nthese attempts is documented in the first published version of his\nDoctrine of Science. In what follows we will focus primarily\non the line of thought presented in this text, although Fichte changed\nhis arguments considerably in the First and Second\nIntroductions into the Doctrine of Science.\n\nFollowing the early Doctrine of Science, we must, according\nto Fichte, accept three fundamental principles\n(Grunds\u00e4tze) of human knowledge without which we could\nnot even make sense of the idea that we can know that there is\nsomething real at all. The first states that self-consciousness or the\nI is a spontaneous (unconditioned) act that in taking place creates or\nposits the I as having existence or being (ein Akt, der im Vollzug\nsein eigenes Sein schafft). The I understood as this\nself-positing act that gives rise to its own being and reality Fichte\ncharacterizes as \u201cdeed-act\u201d, also translated as\n\u201cAct\u201d (Tathandlung), and it is through this\ndeed-act/Act that what we take to be real or having being comes to the\nfore. Fichte arrives at what he presents as his first principle of\nhuman knowledge on the basis of two assumptions. The first is that we\ncan only properly be said to know assertions (judgments or\npropositions) which exhibit the character of certainty\n[Gewissheit], or those which thus express what is actually\nand certainly the case; the second maintains that a regress in the\nprocess of justification with regard to such assertions can only be\navoided if we are able to furnish some principle or fundamental\nproposition which is \u201cutterly unconditioned\u201d\n[schlechthin unbedingt] (as Fichte puts it), one, that is,\nwhich cannot be derived from any other principle, and which, for its\npart, is of such a kind that it alone guarantees the utter certainty,\nand thus the indubitability, that is, the immunity to skeptical\nobjections, of a given proposition. This second assumption leads him\nto the claim that the unquestionable certainty of a proposition can\nnever be demonstrated discursively (by appeal to purely conceptual\nconsiderations) or intuitively (by appeal to any sensuous perception),\nand that, on the contrary, the ground of unconditional certainty can\nonly be found in the constitution of self-consciousness itself. Fichte\nidentifies as an appropriate method by means of which the principle in\nquestion can be derived a procedure which he calls \u201cabstractive\nreflection\u201d. This kind of reflection, according to Fichte, takes\nits point of departure from a proposition which everyone regards as\nunquestionably certain, from a so-called \u201cfact of empirical\nconsciousness\u201d. From this fact, this indubitable proposition,\nthe process of reflection isolates (abstracts) the elements which\nbelong to the content of such a proposition, i.e., belong to that\nabout which the proposition asserts something. What is supposedly\nleft, after this abstraction, is simply the form of the proposition\nwhich consists precisely in affirming the ascription, or\nnon-ascription, of a predicate to a subject. The proposition which\nFichte selects as the point of departure for his \u201cabstractive\nreflection\u201d is the logical law of identity in the form\n\u201cA = A\u201d, a law that is rightly regarded as\nutterly certain, i.e., certain without recourse to any further grounds\nand thus as intrinsically certain. This fact alone already shows that\nwe have the capacity (the faculty) of claiming something as certain\nwithout reference to any further grounds, or, in Fichte\u2019s own\nterminology, of \u201cpositing\u201d something absolutely [etwas\nschlechthin zu setzen]. Reflection on this fact shows according\nto Fichte that the utter certainty of the law of identity is grounded\nin the positing activity of the I (which in this case posits\nidentity), an activity which consists precisely in postulating the\nbeing of what has been posited as identical. Otherwise this activity\nwould not be real, would have no being.\n\nThis result, however, is not yet sufficient to give us the first\nunconditioned and fundamental principle of all knowledge. This is so\nbecause we have arrived at the I as the guarantee of the absolute\ncertainty of a proposition only on the basis of an empirical fact,\nnamely the proposition \u201cA is A\u201d which has\nbeen presupposed as utterly certain. Fichte now rightly observes that\nthe \u201cI am\u201d, as the condition of the certainty of an\nempirical fact, itself merely possesses the status of an empirical\nfact [Tatsache]\u2014if the utterly certain proposition were\nnot given, one would never be able to affirm the utter certainty of\nthe \u201cI am\u201d. Up to this point the \u201cI am\u201d has\n\u201conly been grounded on a fact, and possesses no other validity\nthan that attaching to a fact\u201d (GA I, 2, 257). But in order to discover\nthe first utterly unconditioned principle of all knowledge, we must\nestablish not only the utter certainty of the law of identity, but\nalso the unconditional certainty of the \u201cI am\u201d in such a\nway that this certainty does not depend upon the presence of a fact at\nall. In other words: we must be able to answer the question how the\nutterly unconditioned certainty of the proposition \u201cI am\u201d\nis possible. It is Fichte\u2019s reflections on this question which\nlead to his conception of the I as a deed-act/Act\n(Tathandlung). He reasons along the following lines: we know\nfrom our analysis of the conditions of certainty of the law of\nidentity that the I has the capacity to posit something absolutely in\nthe I. But in order to be able to posit something absolutely in the I,\nthe I itself must be posited. We have also already seen that the\nabsolute positing of the I consists in the activity of positing being.\nIf this is so, and if the \u201cI am\u201d is to depend on nothing\nelse as its condition, we must think of the I as the product of its\nown positing activity, since it would otherwise be quite impossible to\nexplain its being. Now this, in turn, is supposed to imply that we\nmust think the I as an activity which posits its own existence insofar\nas it is active: the I \n\n\nis at the same time the actor and the product of the act; the actor,\nand that which the activity brings forth; act and deed are one and the\nsame; and the \u201cI am\u201d is therefore the expression of an\nAct. (GA I, 2, 259) \n\n\nFor Fichte, a deed-act/Act is not supposed to be a fact, that is,\nsomething which is simply already discovered as given, since the Act\nis logically and ontologically prior to any facts insofar as it\nultimately constitutes (posits) everything which can be a fact for an\nI. The I, understood as Act, is supposed to be something absolutely\nposited precisely because it posits itself, and this self-positing\nconstitutes its essence and guarantees its being, its reality. Again,\nas Fichte says: \u201cThat whose being (essence) merely consists in\npositing itself as being, is the I, as absolute subject\u201d (GA I,\n2, 259). This means, for Fichte, that the I, so understood, displays\nall the characteristics which make it an appropriate candidate for the\nfirst utterly unconditioned principle of all knowledge. Fichte tries\nout various formulations for expressing this first principle in a\nreally adequate fashion. His most accessible formulation is certainly\nthe one he furnishes at the end of section 10 of the first paragraph\nof the Doctrine of Science: \u201cThe I originally posits\nits own being absolutely\u201d (GA I, 2, 261). This insight that the\nI must be conceived as self-positing activity, an activity whose\nperformance consists in its self-realization is meant to make any\ndistinction between epistemological and metaphysical idealism\nobsolete.\n\nThe second principle postulates a necessary act of counter-positing\n(Entgegensetzen) to the self-positing activity of the I\nresulting in what Fichte calls a Non-I, and the third focuses on an\nactivity that gives rise to the concept of divisibility. Fichte\nattempts to justify the introduction of these two principle on\nsystematic grounds, although these principles can only be described as\nunconditional in a qualified respect, by exploiting his own\ndistinction between the form and the content of a proposition.\nAccording to Fichte, every proposition (judgment) can be treated as\neither conditioned or unconditioned in relation to its content, or to\nits form, or to both. If a proposition is unconditioned in either or\nboth of these respects, then it can be described, in Fichte\u2019s\nterminology, as a fundamental principle [Grundsatz]. While\nthe second principle is meant to establish (as a condition of\nknowledge/cognition!) the possibility of the reality of\n\u201cotherness\u201d, of something which is not the I, the third\nprinciple shows how to mediate between the self-positing and the\ncounter-positing acts of the I by reciprocal limitation, thereby\nintroducing a subject-object opposition within the I. Both these\nprinciples are presented as codifications of two further unconditional\nacts of positing on the part of the I. According to Fichte, the I\npossesses, in addition to the capacity for self-positing that is\ncaptured in the first principle, the further capacity of positing a\nnon-I freely and simply (without any further ground). That is to say,\nit has the ability, through what Fichte calls an \u201cabsolute\nact\u201d [absolute Handlung], to posit something as non-I\nthat is opposed to the I. Fichte\u2019s second principle codifies this act\nof \u201ccounter-positing\u201d. Finally, the I is further\ncharacterized by a third capacity, that of freely and simply positing\nthe divisibility of the I and the non-I. The third principle\nspecifically captures this notion of divisibility.\n\nIt is not difficult to grasp what Fichte is attempting to accomplish\nwith the introduction of his second principle. It is supposed to do\njustice to our inexpungible everyday conviction that there is an\nexternal world independent of ourselves, the objects of which are\noutside of and distinguished from us, and to which we can relate in\nterms of knowledge and action alike. But for Fichte this conviction is\njustified not because an external world independent of ourselves\ncompels us to understand it as characterized in such and such a way.\nOn the contrary, it is justified because it belongs to the distinctive\nstructure of the I to organize its world dichotomously through the\nsubject-object distinction or the opposition of the I and the non-I.\nIt is more difficult, on the other hand, to grasp the significance\nwhich Fichte wishes to ascribe to the third principle of divisibility.\nThe motivation for introducing it is obviously to present the non-I\nnot only as the negation of the reality which the I claims to posit in\npositing its own being, but rather to ascribe independent reality,\nindependent being, to the non-I. In pursuing this purpose by recourse\nto the concept of divisibility, Fichte appears to make the implicit\npresupposition that being or reality should be regarded as a kind of\nquantity, as something given in degrees (intensively considered) or\nparts (extensively considered). Once we accept this presupposition,\nthen we cannot in fact avoid bringing something like Fichte\u2019s third\nprinciple into play. For the assumption that we have to conceive\nreality as a distributable plurality, together with the notion that\nthere are real objects possessed of an existence independent of the\nsubject, means that it is necessary, within the Fichtean model of\npositing, to identify a factor responsible for distributing reality\nbetween the I, understood as the knowing subject (and not as absolute\nself-positing ego), and the non-I, understood as the object that it is\nto be known. \n\nOn the basis of these three principles and by reflecting on the\npurported interplay between self-positing and counter-positing in a\nhighly original way, Fichte arrives at a portrait of reality in which\nall \u201cordinary\u201d objects, like walls, trees and people, and\ntheir \u201cnormal\u201d interactions and dependencies, like causal,\nspatio-temporal, and physical force relations, find a place. This\nportrait is claimed to be idealistic because it is the outcome of an\ninsight into the dynamics of these fundamental and opposed positing\nacts and because in the end these activities, according to Fichte,\nare, metaphysically speaking, all there is: \u201cfor the philosopher\nthere is acting, and nothing but acting; because, as a philosopher, he\nthinks idealistically\u201d (Second Introduction, section 7;\nWerke I, 498). Idealism thus starts to become what could be\ncalled from a traditional point of view a\n\u201chybrid\u201d position that intimately connects epistemological\nand ontological elements in that it \u201cexplains \u2026 the\ndeterminations of consciousness\u201d. i.e., our common sense\nconception of reality as an object of knowledge/cognition and agency,\n\u201cout of the acting of the intellect\n[Intelligenz]\u201d without thinking of the intellect as\nsome sort of existing subject:\n\n\nFor idealism the intellect is an acting and absolutely nothing else;\none should not even call it something active because by this\nexpression one points to something substantial which is the subject of\nthis activity. (First Introduction, section 7, Werke\nI, 440)\n\n\nA consequence that Fichte explicitly draws from this understanding of\nidealism is that one can no longer think of realism as a position that\nis opposed to idealism. Rather\n\n\nrealism, \u2026 i.e., the assumption that objects totally\nindependently of us exist outside of us, is contained in idealism\nitself and becomes explained and deduced in it. (Second\nIntroduction, footnote at end of section 1, Werke I,\n455)\n\n\nBecause in Fichte\u2019s philosophical world everything is based on\nthe I as a pure activity, it is not that surprising that his idealism\nvery often was called \u201csubjective idealism\u201d, even though\nhe would resist any identification with Berkeley\u2019s\nsubstance-accident form of immaterialism. He avoids that conception by\nintroducing what could be called an ontology of pure action.\n\nFichte\u2019s dynamic conception of idealism was adopted almost\nimmediately by Friedrich Wilhelm Joseph Schelling (1775\u20131854),\nwho in the first period of his philosophical career became next to\nFichte the most outspoken defender of this hybrid variety of idealism.\nIn doing so he transformed Fichte\u2019s I-centered approach to\nreality via an analysis of the conditions of knowledge/cognition and\nagency into an idealistic version of a monistic ontology. In this he\nwas followed by Hegel. Whereas Fichte had mainly struggled to find an\nadequate expression for his activity-based conception of a\nself-positing I and had referred to anything outside the I only as the\nnon-I posited by the I itself, in his early writings on the philosophy\nof nature Schelling tries to supplement Fichte\u2019s approach by\ngiving a much fuller account of nature, understood as everything that\nappears to be independent of us, in terms of the I-constituting\nactivities. Because of Schelling\u2019s elevation of nature to a\ncentral topic in his presentation of an idealistic worldview his\nposition became characterized, although somewhat misleadingly, as\n\u201cobjective idealism\u201d. On his account, we have to think of\nreality as an original unity (urspr\u00fcngliche Einheit) or\na primordial totality (uranf\u00e4ngliche Ganzheit) of\nopposites that is internally differentiated in such a way that every\nparticular item within reality can be seen as a partial, incomplete,\nor one-sided expression, manifestation, or interpretation of the most\nbasic dynamic opposition characteristic of the whole of reality. This\nview of reality, which in early Schelling is quite explicitly linked\nto Spinoza\u2019s one-substance ontology, obviously does not lead\ndirectly to any idealism whatsoever: one could just as well give it a\nnaturalistic reading. In order to connect a monistic ontology to\nidealism, one has to somehow identify the activities at work in the\nconstitution of the world-whole with mental or spiritual elements that\nare supposed to give conceptual structure to reality. This can be and\nwas done by Schelling at different stages of his philosophical career\nin different ways. In the first edition (1797) of his book Ideas\nfor a Philosophy of Nature (Ideen zu einer Philosophie der\nNatur), he set out to prove idealism by trying to show that\n\u201cthe system of Nature is at the same time the system of our\nmind\u201d (IP 30; SW 1, 134). This claim is not\nmeant to state a reciprocal relation of dependence between nature and\nmind and their characteristic features, i.e., according to Schelling,\nmatter and concept, thereby presupposing that nature and mind, matter\nand concept nevertheless have some reality independently of each\nother. He rather wants us to think of nature and mind, matter and\nconcept as being identical in the sense of being the same: the one is\nthe other and vice versa. The reason why we as finite minds have to\ndifferentiate between them at all lies in a double perspective which\nis forced on us by our natural predisposition to distinguish the\n\u201coutside us\u201d from the \u201cin us\u201d (cf. IP\n39; SW 1, 138) when looking at reality\u2014thus Schelling\nsees dualism as a psychological tendency but not a philosophical\noption. If this disposition and its conditions were understood in the\nright way, we would comprehend that, as he famously writes,\n\u201cNature should be made Mind visible, Mind the invisible\nNature\u201d (IP 42; SW 1, 151) thereby making room\nfor an idealistic conception of reality as World-Soul\n(On the World-Soul is also the title of a 1798 publication by\nSchelling.)\n\nAs a systematic counterpart to the construction of the phenomena of\nnature out of different dynamic factors (forces, activities), in 1800\nSchelling presented his System of Transcendental Idealism.\nHere he set out to demonstrate the development of mental phenomena out\nof these factors which he here calls the unconscious and the conscious\nactivity starting with sensation (Empfindung) and intuition\n(Anschauung) until he arrives via acts of willing at the\naesthetic activity manifested in works of art. He thinks of these\ntranscendental idealistic demonstrations as a necessary complement to\nhis philosophy of nature (cf. SW III, 331 f.) and describes\ntheir mutual relation thus:\n\n\nAs the philosophy of nature brings idealism forth out of realism, in\nthat it spiritualizes the laws of nature into laws of intelligence, or\nadds the formal to the material, so does transcendental philosophy\nbring realism out of idealism, by materializing the laws of\nintelligence into laws of nature, or adds the material to the\nform. (SW III, 352)\n\n\nOn this conception both together, philosophy of nature and\ntranscendental idealism, exhaust the entire scope of philosophy, which\nreveals itself in the end to be nothing but a \u201cprogressive\nhistory of self-consciousness\u201d (fortgehende Geschichte des\nSelbstbewusstseins) (SW III 331).\n\nThis early approach to establishing an idealistic monism and thereby\nvindicating a Fichte-inspired dynamic version of ontological idealism\nwas in turn given up by Schelling a couple of years later in the\nsecond edition of the Ideas and criticized by him as\nproviding a basis only for what he now calls \u201crelative\nidealism\u201d (IP 52; SW 1, 163). It is replaced\nby what he now names \u201cabsolute idealism\u201d (IP 50;\nSW 1, 162). Both his criticism of his earlier World-Soul\nconception and his endorsement of absolute idealism are at least to a\ncertain degree due to Hegel\u2019s discussion of Schelling\u2019s\nphilosophy in his Difference between Fichte\u2019s and\nSchelling\u2019s System of Philosophy (1801). Schelling\u2019s\nnew conception, which underlies what came to be known as his\n\u201cSystem of Identity\u201d (Identit\u00e4tssystem),\ntakes reality to be a dynamic whole which he describes as the\n\u201cundivorced\u201d (ungeschieden) or undifferentiated\nunity of the absolute-ideal or subjectivity and the absolute-real or\nobjectivity in an \u201ceternal act of cognition\u201d (IP\n47; SW 1, 157). This eternal act is all there is, it is\n\u201cthe absolute\u201d. It is disclosed in two fundamentally\ndifferent forms, one of which is characterized by the prevalence of\nsubjectivity whereas in the other form objectivity prevails. These two\nforms give rise to the distinction between an \u201cideal\nworld\u201d and \u201cNature\u201d (IP 49; SW 1,\n161). However, according to Schelling these forms have to be\ndistinguished from the \u201ceternal cognitive act\u201d or the\nabsolute from which the ideal world and Nature originate. This act is\npure activity of knowing that creates its objects in the very act of\ncognition by giving them a form. Because reality is conceived thus as\na dynamic self-organizing cognitive process that lies at the basis of\neven the most fundamental opposition between subject and object,\nSchelling thinks of his ontological monism as a version of idealism.\nHe writes:\n\n\nIf we therefore define philosophy as a whole according to that wherein\nit surveys and presents everything, namely the absolute act of\ncognition, of which even Nature is again only one side, the Idea of\nall ideas, then it is Idealism. Idealism is and remains, therefore,\nthe whole of philosophy, and only under itself does the latter again\ncomprehend idealism and realism, save that the first absolute Idealism\nis not to be confused with this other, which is of a merely relative\nkind. (IP 50; SW 1, 162)\n\n\nIn the end, then, after 1800 Schelling (arguably as well as Fichte in\nhis post-Jena period) seems pushed toward a \u201cnon-dogmatic\u201d\nidealism that combines ontological as well as epistemological idealism\nwithin a monistic framework.\n\nAlthough Georg Wilhelm Friedrich Hegel (1770\u20131831) too embraces\na dynamical conception of idealism in the spirit of Fichte and\nSchelling, he deviates from both of them by not relying on mental\nactivities of some subject or other or on some primordial subjectless\ncognitive act as the most basic features of reality. He thus tries to\ntranscend any traditional form of idealism. Given his deep distrust of\nirreconcilable dichotomies, of anything unmediated and one-sided, one\ncannot expect Hegel to be an advocate of an idea of idealism that is\nconceived of in terms of an alternative to or an opposition against\nrealism or materialism or whatever else. He thus shares with Fichte\nand Schelling the hostility against any attempts to privilege idealism\nover and against realism (or something else) or the other way round,\nbut avoids the suspicion of a reversion to idealism in a monistic\nguise better than either of his predecessors. In the case of Hegel,\nthis hostility towards privileging idealism shows especially well in\nhis criticism of reductive programs as well as of\n\u201cbifurcating\u201d (entzweiend) or separating\npositions in metaphysics and epistemology. A reductive program\naccording to which either everything physical/material is reducible to\nsomething mental and thus confirms idealism or everything mental can\nbe reduced to something physical/material and thus gives rise to\nrealism or materialism is, in his eyes, \u201cridiculous\u201d (cf.\nGW 6, 290 ff). A bifurcating or separating position results\nfrom a project that is based on the claim that one has to distinguish\nbetween a world \u201cfor us\u201d and a world \u201cin\nitself\u201d, where the former is a subject-dependent and in this\nsense idealistic world while the latter is the \u201creal\u201d\nworld although it is essentially totally inaccessible by any\nsubjective cognitive means. It is because of its one-sidedness and its\nputting \u201cthe real\u201d outside of our grasp that such a\n\u201csubjective\u201d idealism is for Hegel unacceptable (see his\ncriticism of Kant in Faith and Knowledge, GW 4, 325\nff.). His objections to and his contempt for both idealism and realism\nin their mutually exclusive forms are well documented in almost all of\nhis writings throughout his philosophical career.\n\nThus, when Hegel in the second edition of his Science of\nLogic (1831) nevertheless claims that in the end \u201c[e]very\nphilosophy is essentially idealism or at least has it as its\nprinciple\u201d (GW 21, 142), he must mean by idealism\nsomething other than traditional idealism and certainly something\nother than Kant\u2019s indeterminate ontological realism. Rather, he\nmust mean by idealism a philosophical outlook that is immune against\nthe charge of grounding a philosophical system in a conception of\nreality that is committed to the acceptance of any irreconcilable\noppositions. Now, for Hegel the most fundamental opposition both from\na systematic and a historical perspective is the opposition between\nthinking and being, or rather, in the preferred terms, between subject\nand object. Looked at from a systematic perspective, this opposition\nis fundamental because of its apparent unavoidability, already at a\ndescriptive level, when it comes to an assessment of the ultimate\ncharacteristics of reality: after all, we want to be able to hold fast\nto the distinction between what is only (in) our (subjective) thought\nand what is (objectively) the case. Considered from a historical point\nof view it shows that\u2014at least within the tradition of\noccidental philosophy\u2014the opposition between thinking and being\nlies at the bottom of the most influential attempts (with very few\nexceptions like Parmenides and possibly Spinoza) to give a\nphilosophical account of the essence of reality and its multifarious\nways of appearing to us. The traditional conviction of the fundamental\nand irreconcilable opposition between thinking and being finds\nexpression in many different ways. These ways include the belief that\nthere is being that is totally independent of or without any relation\nto thinking, or the conviction that thinking is somehow external to\nbeing in that being is just the self-standing provider of material on\nwhich a by itself contentless (inhaltslos) thinking imposes a\ncertain conceptual form, or the assumption that even if there were no\nthinking there would be being and vice versa. However, according to\nHegel it can be demonstrated that to think of thinking and being as\nfundamentally opposed in any of these ways leads to inconsistencies\nresulting in contradictions, antinomies and other bewildering\ndeficiencies. Hence an idealistic philosophical system that is to\novercome these deficiencies has to get rid of the underlying\nfundamental opposition and to show that thinking and being are not\nopposed but ultimately the same. This claim as to the sameness or the\nidentity of thinking and being (subject and object) is the cornerstone\nof Hegel\u2019s metaphysical credo and together with some other\nassumptions leads relatively smoothly to a version of ontological\nmonism as the only convincing shape of an idealistic system.\n\nHowever, a closer look at how Hegel tries to realize a monistic\nidealism reveals that it proved rather complicated to establish a\nphilosophical system based on the identity of thinking and being or\nsubject and object. At the outset this project was to be realized\nwithin the boundaries of two conditions. The first was to present an\nargument in favor of the superiority of idealism that would not just\nmake the endorsement of idealism a question of individual character or\nwhat a person wants to be, a move he thought to be characteristic of\nboth Fichte\u2019s and Schelling\u2019s defense of idealism. The\nsecond was to abandon the view also, according to Hegel, sometimes to\nbe found in Fichte and Schelling, that one has to think of idealism as\nan alternative and in opposition to dogmatism/ realism/\nmaterialism. Not to meet these two conditions were in Hegel\u2019s\neyes two unacceptable shortcomings of any attempt to establish a\nconvincing idealistic worldview. He expressed his dissatisfaction with\nattempts of this kind to establish idealism as the superior approach\nin philosophy quite early (Faith and Knowledge, 1802) by\nreferring to them under the title \u201cphilosophy of reflection of\nsubjectivity\u201d (Reflexionsphilosophie der\nSubjektivit\u00e4t). This kind of philosophy of reflection,\nthough favoring subjectivity and hence giving priority to the\nconceptual and in this sense ideal contributions of the mind to what\nshows up as reality is still according to Hegel stuck in what he later\nused to call the \u201copposition of consciousness\u201d\n(Gegensatz des Bewusstseins) (in both the,\nPhenomenology and the Science of Logic). This kind\nof philosophy is committed to a mode of thinking that takes place\nwithin a framework in which the opposition of thinking and being or\nsubject and object is still basic, dissolved only superficially by\neither abstracting from one of the opposed sides or by establishing a\nrelation of domination between the elements opposed, without\ntranscending and transforming them into a whole, his renowned\n\u201cSubject-Object\u201d, a whole that is both constituted by\nthese elements, the subject and the object, and that at the same time\nconstitutes them as its own internal differentiations.  This way of\novercoming oppositions by thinking of the elements opposed as having\nsignificance only insofar as their mutual relation can be conceived of\nas being constituted by the unity they together form led Hegel to\nclaim that in order to avoid the idea of self-standing or irreducible\noppositions and hence to escape the charge of one-sidedness in cases\nwhere the prioritization of opposites is at stake, one has to follow\nthe methodological maxim that for every opposition there has to be a\nunity in place that consists of the elements opposed. Hegel took this\nprinciple to imply that the \u201cabsolute\u201d, the totality of\nwhat there is and can be, must be conceived of as what he sometimes\ncalls the \u201cidentity of identity and non-identity\u201d\n(Difference-Writing, beginning of Schelling chapter) or as\nthe \u201cunity of unity and multiplicity/diversity\u201d\n(Natural Law Essay, section II) where the terms\n\u201cidentity/unity\u201d in each of these formulations are meant\nto refer to both the whole that gives rise to what is opposed and to\none of the elements in opposition.\n\nBut does the acceptance of such a methodological recipe as a means by\nwhich to transcend oppositions in order to solve the problem of\none-sidedness not just give rise to a justification of an idealism\nthat is not just a one-sided alternative to\nrealism/dogmatism/materialism? It appears that on the basis of this\nmethodological device two sensible options are available both of which\ndo not settle the question of superiority. However, whereas the first\noption leads to a negative result regarding the alleged superiority of\nidealism, the second opens up at least the chance of a positive\nresult. Those favoring the negative option would start from the claim\nthat the very idea of a \u201cSubject-Object\u201d, i.e., of a whole\nthat is prior to and constitutive of its elements, cannot be defended\nby any rational means. They would end up recommending just giving up\non idealism as well as its opposites as positions whose superiority\ncan be defended philosophically, because there is no rational way to\ndecide which of them has to be favored over the other. It is in fact a\nreaction Hegel himself sometimes advocates when he states, e.g., in\nhis Lectures on the History of Philosophy (chapter on later\nskeptics) that both idealism and dogmatism have the status of\nproclamations/assurances and thus turn out to be equipollent.\nSupporters of the positive option would have to give credit to the\nrationality of the strategy, sketched above, of how to overcome\noppositions in a philosophically acceptable way and thus would allow\nfor a \u201cSubject-Object\u201d as the common whole in which the\nopposed sides can be united. But even such an admission would not lead\ndirectly to an argument for the superiority of idealism. It would only\nprovide a reason for favoring a position that could be described as\nreal-idealism (Real-Idealismus), a synthetic product that\nintegrates idealism and its opposites into a unity whose elements,\nthough still distinguishable, are at the same time in some sense\nidentical or (in Hegel\u2019s idiom) sublated (aufgehoben).\nIt is easy to show that most of the German idealists were strongly\nattracted by this positive solution. At some point in their\nphilosophical careers both Fichte and Schelling explicitly used the\nterm \u201cReal-idealism\u201d in order to characterize their views.\nEven Hegel late in life, in a review of a treatise by Ohlert\n(GW 16, 287 ff.), made use of this term as a name for his\nmetaphysical teachings.\n\nThis solution seems to have been in line with Hegel\u2019s way of\nconceiving of how to overcome oppositions in his early Jena writings.\nUnsurprisingly, however, he became dissatisfied with such a tactic\nbecause of its inherent limitations. This dissatisfaction shows\nexplicitly for the first time in the preface of the Phenomenology\nof Spirit. From then onwards he tried in different ways to find a\njustification of idealism in sensu stricto, i.e., a\njustification of a view that (1) attributes priority to non-sensible\nactivities, especially to the activity of thinking, that (2) makes\nrealism/materialism/dogmatism obsolete and that (3) allows for\nsubject-object identity without thereby being committed to\nReal-Idealism. The reasons for his dissatisfaction with attempts that\nlead to Real-Idealism (among them most of his own pre-phenomenological\nsystematic sketches) are quite simple. In the first place, it is\nrather obvious that the move to transcend oppositions by making the\nopposed elements parts of an integrating unity looks like a makeshift,\na terminological stipulation that cannot do justice to what it is\nmeant to achieve, namely, to allow the opposed elements to develop out\nof a unity that is prior to them. Instead of commencing with a\ndeveloping unity, this move, according to Hegel, remains damaged by\npresupposing the opposed components as self-standing, thereby making\nthe unity dependent on the elements and not the other way around.\nSecondly, the unity presented as resulting from a process of\nintegration of what is taken to be opposed cannot be conceived as\nrepresenting a real identity of opposites because of its status as a\nsynthetic product. Unities in order to qualify as real unities after\nHegel\u2019s taste could be pictured in analogy to the\n\u201cKippfiguren\u201d of Gestalt psychology.\nBoth these reasons (together with a couple of more idiosyncratic ones)\nled Hegel to believe that the method of overcoming oppositions by\nstipulating unities is not ultimately feasible for the task at hand,\nhence not able to solve the problem of one-sidedness and consequently\nof no use in the endeavor of justifying the superiority of\nidealism.\n\nThe question, then, is how to proceed in order to establish a version\nof the subject-object-identity idea that is neither subject to the\ncharge of one-sidedness nor to that of just postulating it without any\nargument as a given fact. Though this seems to be a purely technical\ntask, i.e., a task to conceptualize the Subject-Object unity/identity\nin a different way than had been done in the real-idealism approach,\nand although Hegel recognized early the insufficiencies of\nFichte\u2019s, Schelling\u2019s, and even his own initial\nsuggestions for overcoming oppositions, it took him quite a while to\ncome up with a proposal that both avoids the one-sidedness problem and\nthe suspicion that it operates with unfounded assumptions while at the\nsame time it supports the superiority of idealism as a metaphysical\ndoctrine. This is so because he had to realize that it is not just a\nmetaphysical/ontological question as to the status of the\nSubject-Object unity/identity that is at stake, but that there is an\nepistemological worry to be answered before the\nmetaphysical/ontological question can even be addressed. As became\nincreasingly clear to him, the task he had to face consists in\ndemonstrating two things: (1) that it is epistemologically\nwarranted to claim that there are indeed unities of basic oppositions\n(like subject-object, identity-nonidentity, unity-multiplicity,\nthinking-being) that precede their constitutive elements/parts in that\nthey are at the basis of their constitution while at the same time\nconsisting of them and (2) that it is\nmetaphysically/ontologically necessary to think of the most\nbasic unity/identity, i.e., that of subject and object in an\nidealistic fashion, i.e., as a spiritual/mental (geistig)\nitem paradigmatically realized in thinking. For Hegel it is the\nepistemological task that must be solved first before the\nmetaphysical task of giving an idealistic account of the\nsubject-object unity/identity in terms of the sameness of what is\ndifferent/opposed can be tackled. His idealism needs epistemology as\nwell as metaphysics.\n\nThe first task mentioned amounts to answering the question: how can\none convince what he calls in the Phenomenology a\n\u201cnatural consciousness\u201d (nat\u00fcrliches\nBewusstsein), i.e., an ordinary human being that is committed to\nthe common discursive/conceptual standards of reasoning\u2014how can\none convince such a subject by discursive means (and not just\nby appeal to some strange non-standard procedures like intellectual\nintuition or revelation) of the epistemic legitimacy of the assumption\nof a subject-object unity/identity that is prior to and constitutive\nof its parts/elements? Because the answer to this epistemological\nquestion is meant to ground the metaphysical/ontological claim\nconcerning the ultimate constitution of reality, Hegel thought fit to\naddress it in the form of an introduction to what subsequently had to\nbe elaborated in a systematic way as a metaphysical doctrine about\nwhat there ultimately is. This epistemological task turned out to be\nmuch more difficult than Hegel initially thought. This is documented\nby the surprisingly many numbers of different sketches of what he took\nto be an \u201cintroduction\u201d to his system even before he\npublished the best known version of this introduction, the\nPhenomenology of Spirit in 1807. Actually, the\nPhenomenology is not just the best known, it is the only\nversion of an introduction Hegel ever elaborated in detail, at least\nin print, that explicitly addressed the task at hand as an\nepistemological problem. In the second edition of the exposition\nproper of his system, the Encyclopedia of the Philosophical\nSciences in Outline published much later in 1827 (first edition\n1817) he chose a different introductory path to his metaphysical\nproject under the title \u201cPositions of Thought towards\nObjectivity\u201d (Stellungen des Gedankens zur\nObjektivit\u00e4t) for reasons that have to do with a different\nassessment of the epistemological task. However, the\nPhenomenology still remains the most straightforward attempt\nto settle the question as to the metaphysical priority of the\nsubject-object identity as an epistemological problem.\nAlthough looking at Hegel\u2019s different pre-phenomenological\nattempts to find a suitable introduction to his central\nmetaphysical/ontological doctrine is an interesting enterprise in its\nown right, it cannot be dealt with here in detail. It would lead to a\ndiscussion of why Hegel initially, i.e., from 1801 to maybe 1806,\nthought of what he in this early period called \u201clogic\u201d as\na discipline that could function as an introduction to his\nmetaphysics. Of all the fragments that were passed down to us from\nthis period the most complete \u201clogical\u201d version of an\nintroduction is the so-called Jena Systemdraft II from\n1804/05. This system-draft contains a so-called Logic as a\ndiscipline that is meant to present the process of\n\u201celevating\u201d (erheben) an epistemic subject\nequipped with traditionally accepted methodological and logical\nconvictions to the \u201cstandpoint of science\u201d (Standpunkt\nder Wissenschaft), i.e., to a standpoint that is based on the\nmetaphysical doctrine of Subject-Object identity. This process is\ndelineated by Hegel as an introductory logical process that proceeds\nby means of a criticism of standard logical forms like judgments and\ninferences as well as of object constituting concepts, i.e., of\nKantian categories.\n\nIn order to deal with the epistemological problem of demonstrating the\npriority of unities/identities over and against their opposed\nelements, in the Phenomenology Hegel starts with an analysis\nof the conditions of knowledge where knowledge is understood as an\nachievement of a subject\u2019s activity of dealing\ndiscursively/conceptually with the objective world or the world of\nobjects. For him an inquiry into the conditions of knowledge is the\nright starting point because knowledge understood as the activity of\ngaining conceptual access to the world is the only discursive\nattitude available to a subject towards determining what is\nobjectively real, i.e., towards the world. The approach Hegel is\npursuing in order to arrive at the desired result, i.e., the proof of\nthe priority of unity/identity, can be outlined thus: he first\nintroduces the conception of knowledge (Erkennen) that is\nleading his investigation. According to this conception knowledge is\nto be taken as a discursive/conceptual relation established between a\nsubject and an object that allows for some sort of correspondence\n(Entsprechung) between them. The possibility of this\ncorrespondence depends on getting hold of structural features that are\nshared by subject and object on the basis of which a knowledge\nrelation can be established. This is the assumption of isomorphism\nthat underlies any epistemologically-motivated move toward\nidealism.\n\nWith the concept of knowledge settled, Hegel chooses as the point of\ndeparture for his analysis a configuration of this knowledge relation\nbetween subject and object that proceeds on the assumption that the\nrelata of this relation, i.e., the subject and the object stand in\ncomplete opposition to each other, each of them being self-standing\nand a pure another to each other. This configuration is what Hegel\ncalls \u201csense certainty\u201d, a configuration in which the\nknowledge relation is supposed to obtain between two items, a\nsubject-this and an object-this, that are totally isolated from each\nother, have no conceptualizable internal connection whatsoever. Such a\nconception of the knowledge relation proves to be unwarranted because,\naccording to Hegel, it can be shown that the idea of a cognitive\nrelation between totally independent items makes no sense. Instead one\nhas to acknowledge that the very attempt to establish such a\n(unreasonable) conception already presupposes that there indeed is a\nstructural affinity between subject and object, an affinity that\nenables an object to be an object for a subject and that enables the\nsubject to relate to the object. Hegel wants us to think of this\nmutual affinity in terms of conceptual determinations necessary to\ncome up both with the concept of an object of knowledge and with a\ntenable account of a knowing subject. Thus in the case of e.g.,\n\u201csense certainty\u201d the affinity claim is expressed in the\nresult that in order to be an epistemic object an object of cognition\nhas to exhibit the conceptual characteristics of universality\n(Allgemeinheit) and singularity (Einzelnheit)\nprovided by the subject and that the subject itself in order to be\nthought of as an epistemic subject must have at its disposal the\nconceptual resources (in this case the concepts of universality and\nsingularity) necessary to determine the conceptual features of\nits object. The entire process run through in the\nPhenomenology is meant to enrich the features a subject and\nan object have to share in order to arrive at a complete concept of\nboth what a subject and an object are.\n\nIn the Phenomenology the initial scenario of \u201csense\ncertainty\u201d that is based on the absolute opposition between the\nknowing subject and the object known sets the stage for a long series\nof configurations or models of knowledge that is aimed at\ndemonstrating that knowledge in a complete or absolute sense can only\ntake place in a setting where subject and object share all\ntheir respective structural features, i.e., where both, the subject\nand the object, have the same conceptual determinations and thus are\nidentical. This amounts according to Hegel to the insight that if\nknowledge is analyzed in terms of a subject-object relation there is\nfor knowledge (Erkennen) in the end no difference\nbetween the subject and the object or, as he is fond of saying, that\nthere is a difference that is no difference (ein Unterschied, der\nkeiner ist). Among other things this means for Hegel that\nknowledge in the strict sense is ultimately self-knowledge or a state\nof affairs where a subject that stands in the relation of knowing\n(erkennen) to an object is \u201cin truth\u201d related to\nitself, or, as he famously puts it, in the act of knowing\n(Erkenntnisakt) the subject \u201cis in the other (the\nobject) with itself (exclusively related to itself)\u201d (im\nAnderen bei sich selbst sein).\n\nThis epistemological account presented in the Phenomenology\nof how the very possibility of discursive/conceptual knowledge is\nbased in an original identity of opposites or a subject-object\nunity/identity becomes metaphysical/ontological implications because\nof the conviction Hegel shares with the other post-Kantian idealists\nthat knowledge is a real relation. By this he and his idealistic\nallies mean (a) that knowledge is a relation between real relata and\n(b) that knowledge is real only if the relata are real. This\nconviction puts constraints on how to conceive of this unity/identity\nwhen it comes to its content (in a metaphorically analogous way in\nwhich, say, in propositional logic a semantics puts constraints on the\ninterpretation of its syntax). This unity/identity established as the\nbasis of knowledge has to meet (at least) two conditions. First of all\nit has to be such that the subject-object split can be grounded in it\nand secondly it must allow for an interpretation according to which it\nis real or has being (Sein). These conditions function as\nconstraints on how to conceive of subject-object-unity/identity\nbecause they specify what can count as an acceptable interpretation (a\nsemantics) of an otherwise purely structural item (a syntactic\nfeature). Without meeting these two conditions all we have by now\n(i.e., at the end of the Phenomenology) is a claim as to the\ngrounding function of a unity/identity of subject and object structure\n(a syntactic item) that is still lacking an interpretation as to the\ncontent (the semantic element) of all the terms involved in that\nstructure.\n\nIt is by providing an interpretation to the unity/identity structure\nthat Hegel arrives at a defense of idealism in a non-oppositional\nsense. Put somewhat distant from his terminology but relying heavily\non his own preliminary remarks on the question \u201cWith What must\nthe Beginning of Science be made?\u201d in the Science of\nLogic, his line of thought can be sketched roughly thus: the\nPhenomenology has demonstrated that knowledge can only be\nrealized if it establishes a relation between real items. These items\nhave to be structurally identical. Realized or \u201creal\u201d\nknowledge (wahres Wissen) in contradistinction to\nopinion/defective knowledge (what Hegel calls \u201cfalse\nknowledge\u201d) is a discursive/conceptual relation that can only be\nestablished by thinking. Hence if there is knowledge thinking must be\nreal, must have being (Sein haben). Now, thinking is an\nobjective, a real activity in the sense that it\ngives rise to determinations that constitute both the subject and the\nobject. Because it is a discursive/conceptual activity its\nreality/objectivity implies that what is constituted by it, i.e., the\nsubject and the object have to be conceived of as\ndiscursive/conceptual structures whose reality/being just consists in\nnothing else than their being thought\u2014not\ntheir being the object of thought. Conceived of that way\nthinking not only fulfills the two conditions mentioned above (i.e.,\nit grounds the subject-object divide and it is real, has being), it is\nat the same time the only candidate to satisfy them (because\nthere is no other discursive/conceptual activity available).\nTherefore, in order to account for a discursive/conceptual model of\nreality one has to start from the identity of thinking and being or\nfrom the fact that only thinking is real.\n\nFrom this argument as to the sole reality of thinking, it is easy to\nderive a new conception of idealism that is not subject to the\nobjections mentioned above that Hegel raised against (what were, in\nhis eyes) the one-sided attempts by his fellow post-Kantians, in\nparticular Fichte and Schelling. If all there is is thinking and if\nthinking is taken to be not only/primarily an activity of a (human)\nsubject or something that can be present to the senses, but is\nconceived of as self-standing discursive/conceptual and in this\nrespect ideal activity that opens up first and foremost a space for\nopposition in the general shape of subject and object then indeed, as\nhe puts it, \u201cevery philosophy is essentially idealism\u201d\n(GW 21, 142) as long as it shares (regardless of whether\nexplicitly or implicitly) this basic conviction of the reality of\nthinking. This idealism is non-oppositional, for it \u201cthe\nopposition between idealistic and realistic philosophy is therefore\nwithout meaning\u201d (GW 21, 142). One might doubt whether\nthe term \u201cidealism\u201d is a very fitting name for the\nposition Hegel endorses. In a way this term is rather misleading in\nthat it seems to suggest that for Hegel the term\n\u201cthinking\u201d has connotations that point in the direction of\nthe mental, the spiritual. Though Hegel definitely wants these\nconnotations to obtain in certain contexts, they play no role in his\nmetaphysical views. There the only relevant fact is the reality of\nthinking and the consequences of this fact. Hegel himself seems not to\nhave been too happy with the term \u201cidealism\u201d as a\ncharacterization of his philosophy. This is shown by the fact that he\nvery rarely uses it to this purpose. However, setting aside questions\nof terminology, it is safe to say that for Hegel\u2019s general\nconception and defense of idealism three points are the most important\nto acknowledge: (1) it is a metaphysical (and not primarily\nan epistemological) conception of idealism, (2) it is a conception\nthat establishes idealism by relying on the sole reality of thinking\nwhich in turn is taken to be an immediate fact, a given\n(Vorhandenes, cf. GW 21, 55f.) in an almost\nCartesian fashion, (3) however, contrary to the Cartesian \u201cI\nthink\u201d this real thinking is not conceived of as an activity of\na human or non-human subject but as an autochtonous activity that in\nthe process of its own determination gives rise to conceptions of both\nsubject and object founded in the primordial identity of thinking and\nbeing. Hegel certainly departs from Berkeley\u2019s substance-based\nidealism, on which all that exists is finite minds and their ideas and\nthe infinite mind and its, although it can certainly be asked what\npure thinking not grounded in thinkers is supposed to be.\n\nHegel\u2019s basic claim as to the identity of thinking and being\nmight be said to have some initial plausibility if one takes such a\nclaim to be a somewhat metaphorical expression of the view that in our\nways of thinking about objects some conceptual elements are invariably\ninvolved. Understood along these lines, Hegel\u2019s claim could be\nconsidered, as it often is, as nothing but a peculiar version of\nKant\u2019s empirical realism. Such an interpretation might even be\nsuggested by the impression that Hegel as well as Kant takes thinking\nto be an activity that is characterized by operating on and with\nconcepts and that what Hegel calls \u201cbeing\u201d can easily be\nidentified with what within Kant\u2019s epistemological framework is\ncalled \u201creality\u201d, that is, the empirical reality of\nintuited objects rather than their transcendent grounds. Although this\nimpression is by no means entirely groundless, it is still misleading\nbecause it does not do justice to the ontological connotations that\nHegel wants to connect with this claim. For Hegel\u2019s idealism it\nis indeed essential to convince us that it is a demonstrable fact that\nthe world ultimately has to be conceived of as a thought (and thus as\na conceptual item) that has objective existence or (in his\nterminology) that the world is the unique (because all-encompassing)\nConcept (written with a capital \u201cC\u201d) that is engaged in\nthe process of its own realization (its objective expression), i.e., a\nrealized concept. Therefore each individual object contained in the\nworld, be it a physical (a tree, a lemon), a social (a society, a\nstate) or a cultural (an artwork, a religion) object, has to be taken\nto be an element in this process, thus having the status of a partial\nmanifestation of the all-encompassing Concept/world (subject/object,\nthinking/being). Obviously this conception of what the world and the\nobjects it consists of really are\u2014if it is not meant to be just\nanother variation of either a dogmatic idealist claim in the spirit of\nBerkeley or a transcendental idealism \u00e0 la Kant\u2014has to\nuse the terms \u201cconcept\u201d and \u201creal\u201d in a way\nthat is different from their traditional or normal use in the history\nof modern philosophy since Descartes. And so it is. For Hegel a\nconcept is not a general representation in the mind of a subject nor\nis the term \u201creal\u201d meant to be restricted to hinting at\nthe presence of some type of matter either physical or mental. Rather,\nHegel thinks of a concept as providing what could be called a\n\u201cstructure plan\u201d for its own realization, and he takes the\nterm \u201creal\u201d to designate the successful realization of a\nstructure plan or a concept; thus Hegel attempts to use these terms in\na teleological sense without any mentalistic (i.e., psychological or\nrepresentationalistic) ontological commitments. Although these\nsomewhat unconventional connotations of Hegel\u2019s concepts of\n\u201cconcept\u201d and \u201creal\u201d (which have a certain\nbasis in a peculiar German use of these terms) might be confusing,\nthey are\u2014at least in his eyes\u2014by no means without\ndescriptive value. Thus, to use examples that Hegel mentions in the\nPreface to the Phenomenology of Spirit, it makes\nperfectly good sense to describe a fully grown oak-tree as the\nrealization of its concept, i.e., what is contained as genetic\nstructure in the acorn out of which the tree has developed, or to\nthink of a political state as a realization of what belongs to the\nconcept of a state, making the state the realization of a concept or\nan \u201cobjective thought\u201d. However, although these examples\ncan throw some light on why Hegel might think of his approach as\nleading to an ultimately idealistic conception of reality, the\nidealistic aspect of his view strictly speaking has to do with his\ntheory of what he calls \u201cthe Concept\u201d (with a\n\u201cC\u201d) whose realization is the world. It is this theory\nthat commits him not just to idealism because of its radical\nconceptualism but also to metaphysical monism because of the\nsingularity of the Concept, i.e., the world. Within the framework of\nthis theory the Concept is conceived of as providing something like\nthe master plan or the universal structure that governs not only the\nconceptual structure of individual kinds of objects but the structure\nof individual objects as well. This universal structure comes about by\nmeans of a process of conceptual self-determination that results in a\ncomplete exposition of the conceptual elements contained in the\nConcept, a process that is documented in Hegel\u2019s Science of\nLogic. This process of self-determination is understood by Hegel\nas the way in which the Concept realizes itself. After all, the\nConcept, being a thought-object or an object-thought itself, must also\nhave reality or being and thus has to realize itself.\n\nAlthough Hegel definitely wants to overcome what he takes to be\nshortcomings both of Kant\u2019s philosophy and of the positions of\nhis post-Kantian contemporaries Fichte and Schelling, at the same time\nhe does not want to give up on the post-Kantian project of\ntransforming Kant\u2019s transcendental idealism, which restricts\nknowledge to the subject\u2019s own experience, into a robust new\nidealism based on dynamic principles of world-constitution. He differs\nfrom Fichte and Schelling in that he does not ground these principles\neither in some activity of a subject (Fichte) or in a cognitively\ninaccessible primordial unity (Schelling) but in the idea of a\nthoroughly conceptual organization of reality giving rise to what he\ncalls in the introduction to the second edition of the Science of\nLogic an \u201cintellectual view of the universe\u201d\n(Intellektualansicht des Universums) (GW 21, 34). In\nthis way, Hegel does try to reconcile the need for conceptual elements\nconstitutive of traditional epistemological idealism with (most of)\nthe categorical commitments characteristic of traditional ontological\nidealism yet in a way that no longer requires the opposition between\nepistemology and ontology.\n6. Schopenhauer\n\nArthur Schopenhauer (1788\u20131860) heaped a great deal of invective\non Fichte, Schelling, and Hegel. For that reason, Schopenhauer is not\nalways included among the German idealists. And indeed, nothing could\nbe further from Hegel\u2019s version of absolute idealism than\nSchopenhauer\u2019s theory on which behind the realm of appearances\nconstructed in accordance with our own conceptions of space, time, and\ncausality\u2014his form of the empirical realism side of\ntranscendental idealism\u2014there is a unitary reality that is\nutterly irrational or at least arational\u2014his form of\nKant\u2019s ontological realism, but flipped from practical to\ntheoretical and from rational to arational. Nevertheless, since\nSchopenhauer works within a Kantian framework, and identifies\nunderlying reality with pure activity, although of an arational rather\nthan rational kind, it is useful to think of him within the framework\nof idealism.\n\nSchopenhauer puts forward his theory in his main work The World as\nWill and Representation (Die Welt als Wille und\nVorstellung), first published in December, 1818 (with an 1819\ndate on its title page), and then in a much-expanded second edition in\n1844 and yet another expanded edition in 1857. This book had been\npreceded by a doctoral dissertation On the Fourfold Root of the\nPrinciple of Sufficient Reason (1813), which Schopenhauer\nsubsequently regarded as the introduction to his magnum opus. The\nearlier work includes Schopenhauer\u2019s main modifications to the\nstructure of Kant\u2019s epistemology, while the later work accepts\nKant\u2019s idealist interpretation of this epistemology (Book I) and\nthen replaces Kant\u2019s version of the doctrine of things in\nthemselves with Schopenhauer\u2019s own version of the unitary\nnon-rational will underlying all appearance (Book II).\n\nSchopenhauer\u2019s acceptance of the empirical side of Kant\u2019s\ntranscendental idealism combined with his non-rational version of\nKant\u2019s ontological realism is, however, on display\nthroughout The World as Will and Representation. Schopenhauer\naccepts without reservation Kant\u2019s argument that space, time,\nand causality are forms of our own representation that we know a\npriori and impose upon the appearances of objects. He does\nprecede this acceptance with a Fichtean argument that \u201cThe world\nis my representation\u201d, where the sheer \u201cmineness\u201d of\nrepresentation is supposed to be a \u201cform\u2026more universal\nthan any other form\u201d, including space, time, and causality\n(WWR, \u00a71, p. 23). Schopenhauer holds that\n\n\nno truth is more certain, no truth is more independent of all others\nand no truth is less in need of proof than this one: that everything\nthere is for cognition (i.e., the whole world) is only an object in\nrelation to a subject, an intuition of a beholder. (WWR,\n\u00a71, pp. 23\u20134)\n\n\nThis simple and perhaps inescapable thought may be regarded as the\nmost fundamental epistemological motivation for any form of idealism.\nOn the basis of this proposition, Schopenhauer then tries to\ndistinguish his position from what he takes to be the skepticism of\nHume, that there is a real question about whether there is either a\nsubject or an object in addition to representations, and from the\ndogmatism of Fichte, that both of these can be proved; his own view as\ninitially stated is rather that\n\n\nthe object as such always presupposes the subject as its necessary\ncorrelate: so the subject always remains outside the jurisdiction of\nthe principle of sufficient reason. (WWR, \u00a75, p. 35)\n\n\nBut, speaking of dogmatism, he simply accepts from Kant that\n\n\nspace and time can not only be conceived abstractly, on their own and\nindependently of their content, but they can also be intuited\nimmediately,\n\n\nand that\n\n\nThis intuition is not some phantasm derived from repeated experience;\nrather, it is something independent of experience, and to such an\nextent that experience must in fact be conceived as dependent on it,\nsince the properties of time and space, as they are known a\npriori in intuition, apply to all experience as laws that it must\nalways come out in accordance with. (WWR, \u00a73, p. 27)\n\n\nBy this remark, Schopenhauer indicates his recognition that Kant\nderives his epistemological idealism from his understanding of the\nimplications of our a priori cognition of space and time, but\nhe does not attempt to explain Kant\u2019s inference or to add any\nargument of his own. Schopenhauer also does not doubt that there is\nsomething other than the representing subject beyond what it\nrepresents, an underlying reality beginning with its own body as it is\nrather than as it merely appears.\n\nSchopenhauer\u2019s fundamental departure from Kant is already\nsuggested in this passage:\n\n\nWe have immediate cognition of the thing in itself when it appears to\nus as our own body; but our cognition is only indirect when the thing\nin itself is objectified in other objects of intuition. (WWR,\n\u00a76, pp. 40\u20131)\n\n\nWhat Schopenhauer means is that although we have an experience of our\nown bodies, as it were from the outside, through the same forms of\nspace, time, and causality through which we experience all other\nbodies, including other animate bodies, and in this regard we\nexperience all bodies including our own as mere appearance through the\nforms we impose on experience, we also have another experience, each\nof us of his or her own body, as it were from the inside, namely we\nhave an experience of willing an action and of our bodies as the\ninstruments of our wills, with no separation between will and action\nand thus no relevance of spatial separation, temporal succession, or\ndifference between cause and effect. However\u2014and this is the\nargument of Book II\u2014our immediate experience of our own bodies\nas instruments of our wills is an experience of our actions being\nimmediately determined by desire rather than by reason. \u201cTo the\npure subject of cognition as such, [his] body is a representation like\nany other among objects\u201d, but\n\n\nwill\u2026and this alone gives him the key to his own\nappearance, reveals to him the meaning and shows him the inner\nworkings of his essence, his deeds, his movements; (WWR,\n\u00a718, p. 124)\n\n\nand what we discover when we look closely at our wills is that they\nare governed not by reason but by impulse, at its most fundamental\nlevel a \u201cdark, dull driving\u201d (WWR, \u00a727, p.\n174), and even at its highest, most clarified level, still desires or\napparently \u201ccreative drives\u201d that only \u201cseem to\nperform their tasks from abstract, rational motives\u201d\n(WWR, \u00a727, p. 182). It is not our planning and\ncalculating drives that best express the real nature of the will but\nour genitals (WWR, \u00a720, p. 133). Of course, it is well\nknown that following the lead of one\u2019s genitals is a pretty good\nformula for disappointment, and for Schopenhauer this reveals the\nfrustration to which a will driven by desire ultimately leads: either\none does not get what one wants, the object of one\u2019s desire, and\nis frustrated, or one does, but then one wants more, and either does\nnot get that, so is frustrated, or does, but then wants more, and so\non ad infinitum. Trying to truly satisfy desire is the height\nof irrationality, but for Schopenhauer there is nothing else we can\nwill\u2014we can at best try to escape from the clutches of will\naltogether, whether through art, asceticism, or compassion.\n\nBut of course, if the underlying nature of reality, the thing in\nitself, is nothing other than will, then escape from its clutches\nshould not really be possible but should at most be apparent. And not\nonly does Schopenhauer equate our experience of ourselves \u201cfrom\nthe inside\u201d as desire-driven will with our own ultimate reality,\nour character as things in themselves; he also argues that we have no\nchoice but to think of the underlying reality of all\nappearance in this way, because this is our only form of insight\ninto\u2014or acquaintance with\u2014anything as a thing in itself.\nWe can only \u201ctake the key to the understanding of the essence in\nitself of things\u201d to be the\n\n\nkey provided\u2026by the immediate cognition of our own essence, and\napply it to [the] appearances in the inorganic [and organic] world as\nwell,\n\n\neven appearances that are more remote from us than any others.\nUltimate reality, because, Schopenhauer assumes,\n\n\nit is everywhere one and the same,\u2026must be called will\nhere as well as there, a name signifying the being in itself of every\nthing in the world and the sole kernel of every appearance.\n(WWR, \u00a723, pp. 142\u20133)\n\n\nSchopenhauer devotes many pages to empirical descriptions of the\nsimilarities between the forces at work throughout the rest of nature\nand the merely apparently rational but really non-rational character\nof our own behavior, but of course the character of things in\nthemselves cannot be inferred directly from any amount of empirical\ndata; Schopenhauer derives his conclusion not from all this empirical\nillustration but rather from our allegedly immediate rather than\nempirical insight into the character of our own wills and the very\nproblematic premise that at bottom everything is essentially one. His\nposition thus begins from an epistemological premise, namely that we\ncan know ultimate reality through knowing ourselves, and reaches an\nontological conclusion, that ultimate reality must be like ourselves,\nbut in opposition to Kant and the other German idealists he assumes\nthat our own nature is essentially non-rational and therefore that the\nultimate character of reality, although it is in a certain sense like\nthe mental, is also fundamentally non-rational.\n7. Nietzsche (and a glimpse beyond)\n\nIt may seem far-fetched to think of Friedrich Nietzsche\n(1844\u20131900) as an idealist. After all, he presented himself as\nan almost fanatical anti-idealist throughout his life. In many of his\npublished and unpublished writings as well as in his letters he\nexpresses over and again his dislike and his disdain for what he calls\n\u201cidealism\u201d. A telling summary of his position concerning\nidealism is to be found in his letter to Malvida von Meysenburg (20\nOctober 1888):\n\n\nand I treat idealism as untruthfulness that has become an instinct, a\nnot-wanting-to-see reality at any price: every sentence of my writings\ncontains contempt for idealism. (Nietzsche, eKGWB\nBVN-1888, 1135)\n\n\n\nThis harsh assessment is by no means easy to understand given his\nknown sympathies with a perspectival approach to objects of cognition,\nhis insistence that falsification or tampering\n(Verf\u00e4lschung) is at the basis of most of our cognitive\njudgments, and his claims as to the dependence of knowledge on needs.\nConsiderations like these suggest that in spite of his protests,\nidealistic modes of thinking are not alien to Nietzsche. At least some\nof his beliefs are compatible with what has been called here\nepistemological arguments for idealism although Nietzsche himself\nwould have taken these beliefs to express a form of realism. However,\nbefore searching for and elaborating on possible idealistic tendencies\nin his own thoughts, we should find out what \u201cidealism\u201d\nmeant for Nietzsche and why he was so hostile to it.\n\nIdealism, for Nietzsche, seems to be a particularly unappealing form\nof metaphysics, in other words of philosophy as it has been practiced\nthroughout history from the era of the ancient Greeks up to his own\ntime (because of his contempt for Kant\u2019s postulates of pure\npractical reason, Nietzsche gave little credence to Kant\u2019s\ntheoretical critique of traditional metaphysics). Philosophy in this\ntraditional shape he took to be a somewhat enigmatic endeavor to\npursue the mutually excluding tasks of (culture-forming) art and\nreligion on the one hand and of (cognition-focused) science on the\nother (see Nachgelassene Fragmente: Notebook 19, [47], [62], [218]; KSA\n7. 434). It is doomed to failure because of two fundamental\nshortcomings. The first is that it gives a privileged status to truth\nin declaring truth to be the ultimate goal at which it aims. This\npreoccupation with truth is based on the implicit assumption that\ntruth has some overriding value. This assumption has never been\njustified, not even addressed by any philosopher. Nietzsche writes in\nthe Genealogy of Morals (1887: Section 24):\n\n\nTurn to the most ancient and most modern philosophies: all of them\nlack a consciousness of the extent to which the will to truth itself\nneeds a justification, here is a gap in every philosophy\u2014where\ndoes it come from? Because the ascetic ideal has so far been\nlord over all philosophy, because truth was set as being, as\ngod, as the highest authority itself, because truth was not\nallowed to be a problem. Do you understand this\n\u201callowed to be\u201d?\u2014From the very moment that faith in\nthe God of the ascetic ideal is denied, there is a new problem as\nwell: that of the value of truth.\u2014The will to\ntruth needs a critique\u2014let us hereby define our own\ntask\u2014the value of truth is tentatively to be called into\nquestion. (KSA 5. 401; Third Essay)\n\n\nHowever, it is not the problem of the value of truth but the second\nshortcoming that, in Nietzsche\u2019s eyes, leads directly to\nmetaphysics. It is the tendency of philosophers to deny the obvious,\nto neglect surfaces in favor of what is allegedly behind them, out of\nhabitual weakness and anxiety to prefer the stable and immutable over\nand against change and becoming. This critical sentiment Nietzsche\nexpresses quite often at different places in many of his published and\nunpublished writings. A nice example is the following note:\n\n\nOn the psychology of metaphysics. This world is\napparent\u2014consequently there is a true world. This world is\nconditioned\u2014consequently there is an unconditioned world. This\nworld is full of contradiction\u2014consequently there is a world\nfree from contradiction. This world is becoming\u2014consequently\nthere is an existing [seiende] world. All false inferences\n(blind trust in reason: if A is, there must be its opposing concept\nB). It is suffering that inspires these inferences: at bottom there\nare wishes that such a world might be; similarly hatred of a world\nthat causes suffering expresses itself through the imagination of\nanother world, one full of value: the ressentiment of the\nmetaphysicians against the actual world is here creative. (Notebook 8\n[2]; reprinted in KSA 12. 327)\n\n\nThis tendency to \u201cfalsify\u201d (verf\u00e4lschen) or\nto \u201cre-evaluate/reframe\u201d (umdeuten) reality out\nof resentment is, according to Nietzsche, especially well documented\nin the idealistic tradition in metaphysics, as is shown\nparadigmatically in Plato\u2019s idealism. It was Plato who invented\nthe idea of another world that is much more real, much more true than\nthe ever changing, always unstable world in which we live; he invented\nthe fiction of the supreme reality of an imperishable and everlasting\nideal world inhabited by archetypal ideas and immutable forms, a\n\u201cworld in itself\u201d in comparison to which the\n\u201cLebenswelt\u201d of everyday experience is just a\npale shadow. Yet Nietzsche seems undecided how to evaluate the real\nmotives that led Plato to his idealism. Sometimes he wants to\ndistinguish Plato from other idealists by crediting him with some\nobscure positive reason for endorsing idealism. In section 372 of\nThe Gay Science, entitled precisely \u201cWhy we are not\nidealists\u201d, he writes:\n\n\nIn sum: all philosophical idealism until now was something like an\nillness, except where, as in the case of Plato, it was the caution of\nan overabundant and dangerous health, the fear of overpowerful senses,\nthe shrewdness of a shrewd Socratic. (KSA 3. 623)\n\n\nHowever, there are other passages where Nietzsche is not in such a\ncharitable mood and where he presents the ultimate reasons for\nPlato\u2019s strong leanings towards idealism as rooted in weakness\nand resentment just as with all the other idealists in the history of\nphilosophy (e.g., Ecce Homo 3; reprinted in KSA 6.\n311). His ultimate verdict on metaphysics in all its ancient and\nmodern forms is nicely expressed in the following note:\n\n\nOn the psychology of metaphysics. The influence of fearfulness. What\nhas been most feared, the cause of the most powerful suffering (the\nlust for domination, sexual lust, etc.) has been treated by humans\nmost hostile and eliminated from the \u201ctrue\u201d world. Thus\nthey have step by step wiped out the affects\u2014claimed God to be\nthe opposite of the evil, i.e., reality to consist in the negation of\ndesires and affects (which is to say precisely in nothingness).\nLikewise they hate the irrational, the arbitrary, the accidental (as\nthe cause of countless physical suffering). Consequently they negate\nthis element in that-which-is-in-itself, they conceive it as absolute\n\u201crationality\u201d and \u201cpurposiveness\u201d. In the same\nway they fear change, transitoriness: therein is expressed an\noppressed soul, full of mistrust and bad experience (The case of\nSpinoza: an inverted sort of person would count this change as\ncharming). A playful being overladen with power would call precisely\nthe affects, unreason and change good in an eudaimonistic sense,\ntogether with their consequences, with danger, contrast, dissolution,\netc.. (KSA 13. 536)\n\n\nHowever, this thoroughly critical assessment of all forms of idealisms\nas abominable expressions of intellectual weakness and vindictiveness\nseems to be at odds with another of Nietzsche\u2019s cherished\nbeliefs, according to which we have to take reality to be not only\ndependent on but ultimately constituted by the respective perspectives\non or the respective ways of interpreting what we encounter. This\nNietzschean view can give rise to the impression that in the end he\nmight have been closer to endorsing some form of epistemologically\nmotivated idealism. This leads to the topics of perspectivism and\ninterpretation (Auslegung) in Nietzsche.\n\nAlthough the details are far from clear, the general tendency of his\nperspectivism is expressed quite well in aphorism 374 from The Gay\nScience:\n\n\nHow far the perspectival character of existence extends, indeed\nwhether it has any other character; whether an existence without\ninterpretation, without \u201csense\u201d, does not become\n\u201cnon-sense\u201d; whether, on the other hand, all existence is\nnot essentially an interpreting existence\u2014that cannot\nbe decided, as would be fair, even by the most studious and scrupulous\nanalysis and self-examination of the intellect; for in the course of\nthis analysis, the human intellect cannot avoid seeing itself under\nits perspectival forms, and solely in these.\u2026Rather,\nthe world has once again become infinite to us: insofar as we cannot\nreject the possibility that it includes infinite\ninterpretations. (KSA 3. 626)\n\n\nThis view, according to which, further, the world each of us is\nexperiencing is the product of an interpretation forced on us by some\nunconscious overriding drive (Trieb) that is the formative\nmark of the individual character of each of us, might be seen as\nendorsing a version of idealism if, as it is here, idealism is\nunderstood as the claim that what appears to be known as it is\nindependent of the mind is in the end inescapably marked by the\ncreative, formative, constructive activities of human mind, whether\nindividual or collective. However, it is far from clear whether\nNietzsche wants us to think of this process of interpretation which\nleads to a specific perspective as a mind-dependent activity.\nSometimes it seems as if he is favoring a quasi-Humean view according\nto which the intellect operates in the service of some anonymous\naffective and emotional drives in such a way that it just provides a\nset of necessary means to consciously realize what drives force us to\ndo. The following note, for example, points in this direction:\n\n\nAgainst positivism, which would stand by the position \u201cThere are\nonly facts\u201d, I would say: no, there are precisely no facts, only\ninterpretations. We can establish no fact \u201cin itself\u201d: it\nis perhaps nonsense to want such a thing. You say \u201cEverything is\nsubjective\u201d: but that is already an interpretation, the\n\u201csubject\u201d is not anything given, but something invented\nand added, something stuck behind\u2026To the extent that the word\n\u201cknowledge\u201d [Erkenntnis] has any sense, the world\nis knowable: but it is interpretable differently, it has no sense\nbehind it, but innumerable senses, \u201cperspectivism\u201d. It is\nour needs that interpret the world: our drives and their to and fro.\nEvery drive is a kind of domination, every one has its perspective,\nwhich it would force on all other drives as a norm. (Notebook 7 [60].\nKSA 12. 315)\n\n\nIn other passages Nietzsche seems to be more in line with a by and\nlarge Kantian view according to which the intellect provides some\nrules of transformation of what is given by the senses as individual\nand discrete data into more general representations. Thus we find him\nclaiming in section 354 of The Gay Science:\n\n\nThis is what I understand to be true phenomenalism and\nperspectivism: that due to the nature of animal\nconsciousness, the world of which we can become conscious is\nmerely a surface- and sign-world, a world turned into generalities and\nthereby debased to its lowest common denominator,\u2014that\neverything that enters consciousness thereby becomes superficial,\nthin, relatively stupid, general, a sign, a mark of the herd, that all\nbecoming-conscious involves a vast and fundamental corruption,\nfalsification, superficialization, and generalization. (KSA\n3. 593)\n\n\nBe this as it may, at least as far as epistemological idealism is\nconcerned it is by no means obvious that either his explicit criticism\nof idealism or his remarks on the ways we make up epistemic worlds\nprevent Nietzsche from coming close to an idealist position himself.\nThis is so because in epistemology his main enemy does not seem to be\nidealism but all forms of realism.\n\nAlthough his epistemology does not explicitly imply any ontological\nclaims, one could be tempted to see Nietzsche as toying with some\nontologically idealistic fantasies. His speculations concerning the\nwill to power as the ultimate dynamic foundation of all reality fall\ninto this category. For example,\n\n\nPerspectivism is only a complex form of specificity[.] My idea is,\nthat every specific body strives to become lord over all of space and\nto expand its force (\u2014its will to power) and to repel everything\nthat resists its own expansion. But it perpetually collides with the\nequal efforts of other bodies, and ends by making an arrangement\n(\u201cunifying\u201d) with those that are closely enough related to\nit:\u2014thus they conspire together to power. And the process goes\non\u2026. (Notebook 14 [186]. KSA 13. 373 f.)\n\n\nThis idea of conspiring forces as the supreme world-constituting\nentities can look like an allusion to Kant\u2019s physics of\nattraction and repulsion, but also to a version of ontological\nidealism like those of Fichte and Schelling because it too invites us\nto conceive of dynamic processes as ontologically prior to (physical\nor mental) objects and events. Thus, in the end there are no real\nobstacles to thinking of Nietzsche as an idealist on ontological as\nwell as epistemological grounds, although the speculations that lead\nhim in the former direction may be separable from the latter.\n\nHowever, even after the heyday of German idealism that ended with\nHegel\u2019s death, it is not just the work of Schopenhauer and\nNietzsche that show traces of idealistic thinking in the German\nspeaking world. Although it goes beyond the scope of this article,\nsome hints about the fate of idealism in Germany might be appropriate.\nInterest especially in metaphysical versions of idealism waned in\nGermany in the second half of the nineteenth century and the first\ndecades of the twentieth (although it remained lively in other parts\nof Europe, e.g., in Italy, in the person of Benedetto Croce), but\nengagement with idealist positions and points of view did not entirely\nvanish. The decline of interest in idealism during this period had to\ndo primarily with a certain aversion against what was taken to have\nbeen an excessive and extravagant usurpation of all fields of\nintellectual discourse by the classical German philosophers under the\npretext of idealism. This line of criticism was voiced most forcefully\nby influential natural scientists like Hermann von Helmholtz.\nMarginalization of idealism in these years also was an effect of the\nrise of Neo-Kantianism, which at least partly came into being both in\nits Marburg-school (Hermann Cohen, Paul Natorp, Ernst Cassirer) and in\nits Southwest(Heidelberg)-school (Wilhelm Windelband, Heinrich\nRickert, Emil Lask) version as a reaction against the German\nidealists. Although insofar as Neo-Kantianism was a reaction mainly to\nabsolute idealism it could not entirely reject epistemological\narguments of the kind that had traditionally led to idealism,\nespecially in its Kantian variety. Hence idealistic tendencies can be\nfound in Neo-Kantianism too, and Martin Heidegger\u2019s later\nversion of realism can be interpreted as a response to the idealism in\nNeo-Kantianism.\n\nDespite these critical attitudes towards idealism, which contributed\nto its decline as a major philosophical position in the German\nintellectual milieu before the first World War, idealistic claims\nbased on metaphysical and/or epistemological arguments can still be\nfound in the works of some of the (at least at that time) better known\nphilosophers. In particular, the writings of Friedrich Adolf\nTrendelenburg (1802\u20131872) and Rudolf Hermann Lotze\n(1817\u20131881) are documents of a lasting influence of idealistic\nfigures and practices of thought, as was highlighted in detail by\nBeiser (2013). Trendelenburg\u2019s interpretation of his central\nconcept of motion (Bewegung) and Lotze\u2019s vindication of\nhis theory of value (Wert) reveal quite tellingly their\nefforts to preserve essential idealistic features of both\nHegel\u2019s metaphysics (Trendelenburg) and Kant\u2019s\nepistemology (Lotze). It also has to be kept in mind that during this\nperiod there were still active right (old) and left (new) Hegelians\nwho were either critically or apologetically committed to a broadly\nHegelian or idealistic framework in philosophy. There were also those\naround who sympathized with certain aspects of Hegel\u2019s\nphilosophy. All these voices had some impact on philosophical\ndiscussions mainly about religion (e.g., Immanuel Hermann Fichte,\nChristian Hermann Weisse) and politics (e.g., Bruno Bauer, Ludwig\nFeuerbach, David Friedrich Strauss). A similar observation can be made\nwith respect to Karl Marx and the Marxists: although they were\noutspoken opponents of an idealism in Hegel\u2019s sense, their\nanti-idealism did not stop them from entertaining idealistic notions\nof the development of history or the unavoidability of social\nprogress, with eventually profound consequences for twentieth-century\nhistory. In spite of all this, it is fair to say that idealism fell\nout of fashion in the German speaking world, and has stayed that\nway.\n8. British and American Idealism\n\nThings were different in the English-speaking world, where idealism\nbecame an important topic in a wide spectrum of philosophical\ndiscussions ranging from metaphysics via aesthetics to moral and\nsocial theories. In England, Scotland, and Wales an idealism that was\nultimately both epistemological and ontological in motivation became\nthe dominant approach to philosophy for several decades, while in the\nUnited States idealism could not monopolize philosophy, having to\nshare the stage with and ultimately reach an accommodation with\npragmatism, but it nevertheless also flourished for several decades.\nThe best known and most outspoken spokesmen in favor of idealistic\nconceptions in metaphysics and elsewhere in Britain in these years\nwere Thomas Hill Green and Francis Herbert Bradley at Oxford and John\nMcTaggart Ellis McTaggart at Cambridge, while in the United States the\nmost prominent idealist was Josiah Royce at Harvard, where\nidealism\u2019s having to share the stage with pragmatism was\npersonified in Royce\u2019s friendly rivalry with William James and\nin Royce\u2019s ultimate attempt to synthesize his view with that of\nCharles Sanders Peirce. Although all of these figures are frequently\ncharacterized as being indebted to Hegel\u2019s writings and\nadvocating a Hegelian view of reality, their various positions are at\nbest in a somewhat indirect, almost only metaphorical, sense informed\nby Hegel\u2019s philosophy. In fact, these philosophers were more\nwilling to call themselves idealists than had been the earlier German\nidealists who supposedly inspired them, but who as has been argued\nwere just as interested in escaping as in accepting the label. This is\nshown most tellingly insofar as their approach to a defense of\nidealism goes back to a state of the discussion characteristic of the\nperiod prior to Hegel and German idealism in general, rather\nconnecting more directly to an understanding of idealism influenced by\neighteenth-century disputes in the wake of Berkeley. None of these\nfigures except perhaps Royce continued to explore a dynamic conception\nof idealism distinctive of Hegel and the other German\nidealists\u2014Royce in fact wrote more extensively and insightfully\non Hegel and his immediate predecessors than any of the others with\nthe exception of McTaggart. In general, the late nineteenth-century\nidealists were more inclined to think of idealism or, maybe more\naccurately, spiritualism again as a genuine alternative to materialism\nand embark again on the controversy whether matter or mind/spirit is\nthe ultimate \u201cstuff\u201d of reality. These philosophers were\nthus more willing to identify themselves as idealists than had been\ntheir predecessors. However, these philosophers were not all equally\nmonists. Both Bradley and McTaggart, for whom a defense of idealism\nconsists mainly in establishing the ontological point that reality is\nexclusively spirit, were, and thus their idealism could also be called\n\u201cspiritual monism\u201d. But both Green at the beginning of the\nmovement and Royce towards its end strove for more nuanced positions,\nnot excluding the existence of matter from their idealisms, and thus\nresisted monism. But all their efforts to establish a convincing form\nof idealism, whether in the form of spiritualism or in a form that\nallowed some role for matter as well, became rapidly unfashionable\neven during the lifetimes of all these philosophers (except for Green,\nwho died young) due to what was called \u201cthe revolt against\nidealism\u201d staged at the turn of the twentieth century in Britain\nby Bertrand Russell and G. E. Moore and a decade later in the United\nStates by a group of \u201cNew Realists\u201d. However, as we will\nsuggest at least Russell was himself pushed back in the direction of\nsome form of idealism, perhaps only on epistemological grounds, by the\ntime his own thought reached the stage of his \u201clogical\natomism\u201d. For the most part, however, after the attacks on\nBradley and Royce, explicit avowal of idealism became rare, with a few\nexceptions such as the prominent defense of idealism by Brand\nBlanshard in the 1930s and less prominent defenses by Timothy Sprigge\nand John Foster in the early 1980s\n\nThomas Hill Green (1836\u201382) was the first of the great Oxford\nidealists. He is best remembered for a lengthy polemic with Hume that\nhe published in the form of an introduction to a collected edition of\nHume that he co-edited and for his posthumously published\nProlegomena to Ethics, which is a polemic against\nutilitarianism from the point of view of a perfectionism inspired by\nKant as well as by Hegel. But the first of the four books of the\nProlegomena is a \u201cMetaphysics of Knowledge\u201d,\nbeginning with a statement of \u201cThe Spiritual Principle in\nKnowledge and in Nature\u201d (1893: 13), which argues for a form of\nidealism on both epistemological and ontological grounds, and\nGreen\u2019s posthumous works also included a set of lectures on Kant\nin which he engaged quite directly with Kant\u2019s form of idealism.\nGreen also left behind a set of Lectures on the Principles of\nPolitical Obligation that form one of the crucial documents of\nthe political and social philosophy of British idealism and of\nidealism in the broadest sense mentioned at the outset of this\nentry.\n\nGreen\u2019s motivation in arguing for idealism in the\nProlegomena is to prepare the way for a conception of the\nwill as free and creative as the foundation of his ethics\u2014in\nthis regard Green\u2019s view is as much in the spirit of\nKant\u2019s practical idealism as it is Hegelian. Green\u2019s\nidealism is expounded in three main steps. First, and here also much\ninfluenced by Kant, he argues that knowledge never consists in the\nmere apprehension of discrete items, but in the recognition of order\nor relation, and that such order or relation is not given but is\nconstituted by and in consciousness. Thus,\n\n\nThe terms \u201creal\u201d and \u201cobjective\u201d\u2026have\nno meaning except for a consciousness which presents its experiences\nto itself as determined by relations, and at the same time conceives a\nsingle and unalterable order of relations determining them, with which\nits temporary presentation, as each experience occurs, of the\nrelations determining it may be contrasted. (Prolegomena,\n1893: 17)\n\n\nFrom this he infers that\n\n\nexperience, in the sense of a consciousness of events as a related\nseries\u2014and in no other sense can it help to account for the\nknowledge of an order of nature\u2014cannot be explained by any\nnatural history, properly so called, (1893: 21\u201322)\n\n\nbut must instead be constituted by mind itself, or,\n\n\nthe understanding which presents an order of nature to us is in\nprinciple one with an understanding which constitutes that order\nitself. (1893: 23)\n\n\nThus far, Green\u2019s position could be considered an\nepistemological argument for idealism. However, he quickly moves\nbeyond a merely epistemological argument, because his next move is to\nargue that since the order of which any individual human being is in\nvarious ways and to various degrees aware obviously extends beyond\nwhat could plausibly be thought to be constituted just by that\nindividual, the order of which we are each aware must be constituted\nby a mind or intelligence greater than that of any of us, thus there\nmust be \u201can eternal intelligence realized in the related facts\nof the world\u201d, and the world must be \u201ca system of related\nfacts rendered possible by such an intelligence\u201d, which\nintelligence \u201cpartially and gradually reproduces itself in us,\ncommunicating piece-meal but in inseparable correlation\u201d aspects\nof that order to each of us if not complete knowledge of it to any of\nus (1893: 38). Green\u2019s insistence on a supra-individual\nintelligence as the source of cosmic order in which individual\nintelligences in some way participate is a decided move beyond\nepistemology, and in his own view it is also a significant departure\nfrom Kant, whose agnosticism about the real nature of things in\nthemselves, at least in the theoretical mood, \u201cwould at once\nwithhold us\u201d from such an inference to the \u201cspirituality\nof the real world\u201d (1893: 43). However, and here is the third\nmain thesis of Green\u2019s form of idealism, the participation of\nindividual human beings in the supra-individual intelligence which\nconstitutes the comprehensive system of relations can be seen as an\napprehension of some portion of that order by animal\norganisms:\n\n\nin the growth of our experience, in the process of our learning to\nknow the world, an animal organism, which has its history in time,\ngradually becomes the vehicle of an eternally complete consciousness;\n(1893: 72)\n\n\nit is the eternal consciousness,\n\n\nas so far realized in or communicated to us through modification of\nthe animal organism, that constitutes our knowledge, with the\nrelations, characteristic of knowledge, into which time does not\nenter, which are not in becoming but are once for all what they are.\n(1893: 73)\n\n\nGreen\u2019s form of spiritualism is thus not incompatible with\nontological dualism: the object of all knowledge is the complete and\neternal order of things, which must be constituted by an intelligence\ngreater than that of any individual human being, but individual human\nbeings are in fact organisms, thus matter, to which some aspect of\nthat intelligence is communicated. The epistemological aspect of\nGreen\u2019s idealism is complete, because knowledge on the part of\nan individual is understood as consisting in a grasp of an order that\nis itself mental, but his ontology is not exclusively mentalistic, for\nwhile it includes the necessary existence of a supra-individual\nintelligence or spirit but allows the existence of animal organisms\n(and thus presumably of other forms of matter as well).\n\nFrancis Herbert Bradley (1846\u20131924), however, argued for a more\nexclusive spiritualism, or an idealist ontology. Bradley presents his\nmetaphysical views on the constitution and the main characteristics of\nreality most explicitly in Appearance and Reality: A Metaphysical\nEssay, which was first published in 1893 and reprinted many times\nduring his lifetime. He famously proceeds from the claim that the\ntraditional and received \u201cideas by which we try to understand\nthe universe\u201d are contradictory (1893: 11 [1897: 9]). He\nsubstantiates this claim by examining a range of central concepts from\nmetaphysics and epistemology, among them the concepts of primary and\nsecondary qualities, of substance and attribute, of quality and\nrelation, space and time, of causality as well as the concept of a\nthing and that of the self. The best known of his destructive\narguments against these conceptions is that against qualities and\nrelations because it played a role in the discussion that arose at the\nturn of the twentieth century between Bradley, Russell and Moore\n(among others) about the logical and ontological status of relations,\ni.e., whether they are \u201cinternal\u2019\u2019 or\n\u201cexternal\u201d to their terms. As to qualities and relations\nBradley claims: \n\n\nThe arrangement of given facts into relations and qualities may be\nnecessary in practice, but it is theoretically unintelligible. The\nreality, so characterized, is not true reality, but is appearance.\n(1893: 25 [1897: 21]) \n\n\nHe starts with pointing out that \u201c[q]ualities are nothing\nwithout relations\u201d (ibid.). This is so because in order to be\nqualities they have to differ from other qualities and hence have to\nbe distinct. However, without relations they could not be distinct.\nBut distinctiveness presupposes plurality and plurality relations.\n\n\n\nTheir plurality depends on relation, and, without that relation, they\nare not distinct. But, if not distinct, then not different, and\ntherefore not qualities. (1893: 28 [1897: 24]) \n\n\nNot only without relations are qualities nothing,\n\u201c[u]nfortunately, taken together with them, they are equally\nunintelligible\u201d (1893: 30 [1897: 25]). The reason is that one\ncannot account for their distinctiveness if their distinctiveness is\nbased on their being different: \u201cIn short, qualities in a\nrelation have turned out as unintelligible as were qualities without\none\u201d (1893: 31\u201332 [1897: 27]). The same holds, according\nto Bradley, from the side of relations. \u201cThey are nothing\nintelligible, either with or without their qualities\u201d (1893: 32\n[1897: 27]). They are nothing intelligible without qualities because\n\u201ca relation without terms seems mere verbiage\u201d (ibid.).\nThey are nothing intelligible with qualities either for in order for a\nrelation to relate it must stand in a relation to what it relates\nwhich makes it into a quality that requires \u201ca new\nconnecting relation\u201d (ibid.) if it is to relate to that quality.\nBradley summarizes as the result: \n\n\nThe conclusion to which I am brought is that a relational way of\nthought\u2014any one that moves by the machinery of terms and\nrelations\u2014must give appearance, and not truth. (1893: 33 [1897:\n28]) \n\n\nThe result of his examination not just of the concepts of quality and\nrelation but of all the other concepts he deals with consists in the\nverdict that all attempts to capture the true nature of reality in\nterms of these categories are futile because all these concepts are\nunintelligible, inconsistent and in the end self-contradictory. This\nmeans that what is designated by means of them cannot be real, but can\nonly reflect the way the world appears to us, not the way it really\nis. This diagnosis is based on Bradley\u2019s fundamental conviction\nthat \u201cultimate reality is such that it does not contradict\nitself\u201d (1893: 136 [1897: 120]). He takes this to be \u201can\nabsolute criterion\u201d (ibid.). However, to be just appearance is\nnot to be unreal in the sense of an illusion. On the contrary,\nalthough appearance is \u201cinconsistent with itself\u201d, one\ncannot deny its existence or \u201cdivorce it from reality\u201d\nbecause \u201creality, set on one side and apart from all appearance,\nwould assuredly be nothing\u201d (1893: 132 [1897: 114]).\n\nBut does this ontological argument for idealism exclude epistemology\naltogether? That is, since appearance always proves to be an\ninadequate way in which reality is present to us, is it beyond our\nmeans ever to become acquainted with the true essence of ultimate\nreality or can we avoid skepticism and claim that it is indeed\npossible for us to have access to the constitutive nature of reality?\nBradley emphatically endorses the latter possibility. According to\nhim, the self-contradictoriness of what is appearance already implies\nthat there is positive knowledge of reality: reality has to be One in\nthe sense that it does not allow discord and it must be such that it\ncan include diversity (cf. 1893: 140 [1897: 123]), i.e., \u201cthe Absolute is \u2026 an\nindividual and a system\u201d (1893: 144 [1897: 127]). This character\nof reality as an internally diversified individual system is revealed\nto us in sentient experience. \u201cSentient experience \u2026 is\nreality, and what is not this is not real\u201d (ibid.). According to\nBradley it is this sentient experience that \u201cis commonly called\npsychical existence\u201d (ibid.). The material basis of sentient\nexperience is exhausted in feeling, thought, and volition. Thus\nreality consists in what has to be taken as the undifferentiated unity\nof these modes of sentient experience before these modes make their\nappearance as different aspects of experience. This leads Bradley to\nassume that what is ultimately real is just what gives rise to\nappearances where appearances have to be understood as specific forms\nunder which the underlying undifferentiated unity appears in each of\nthese different aspects of experience. In his words: \n\n\n\u2026 there is no way of qualifying the Real except by appearances,\nand outside the Real there remains no space in which appearances could\nlive. (1893: 551 [1897: 489]) \n\n\nAlthough he concedes \u201cour complete inability to understand this\nconcrete unity in detail\u201d he insists that this inability\n\u201cis no good ground for our declining to entertain it\u201d\n(1894: 160 [1897: 141]). And although he claims at the end of his\nmetaphysical essay that he does not know whether his\n\u201cconclusions\u201d are to be called Realism or Idealism (1893:\n547 [1897: 485]), at the very end he nevertheless abruptly states:\n\u201cWe may fairly close this work then by insisting that Reality is\nspiritual\u201d (1893: 552 [1897: 489). This might lead us to\nassume that, \u201cin the end\u201d (a favorite phrase of\nBradley\u2019s), it was primarily his search for a basis for\nspiritualism and not so much a defense of idealism understood as\nopposed to realism that motivated him to explore the true nature of\nreality; in other words, he was ultimately driven by an impulse toward\nidealism by ontological premises even though he had developed powerful\narguments epistemological arguments for idealism.\n The identification of idealism with spiritualism, thus again an\nontological interpretation of idealism, is most explicit in the works\nof John McTaggart Ellis McTaggart (1866\u20131925). His earliest\nwork, \u201cThe Further Determination of the Absolute\u201d (first published as a pamphlet in 1893, then as Chapter IX of Studies in Hegelian Cosmology [1901] and in Philosophical Studies [1934]), starts\nwith the following proclamation:\n\n\nThe progress of an idealistic philosophy may, from some points of\nview, be divided into three stages. The problem of the first is to\nprove that reality is not exclusively matter. The problem of the\nsecond is to prove that reality is exclusively spirit. The problem of\nthe third is to determine what is the fundamental nature of spirit.\n(1901 [1934: 210 f.])\n\n\nAnd the last of his writings published in his lifetime (\u201cAn\nOntological Idealism\u201d) starts with the confession, explicitly\nemploying the same terminology that we have used here:\n\u201cOntologically I am an Idealist, since I believe that all that\nexists is spiritual\u201d (1924 [1934: 273]). He takes spirit to be\nthe sum total of individual spirits or selves connected by the\nrelation of love and bases this conviction on the claim that only this\nconception of what ultimate reality consists in allows us to overcome\nunavoidable contradictions connected with all other attempts to\nreconcile unity and diversity as the distinguishing marks of reality.\nHarmony between unity and diversity can be established only on the\nbasis of an all-encompassing relation of love between all the\ncharacteristic elements of reality, which in turn presupposes thinking\nof ultimate reality as a community of spirits or as Spirit.\nThese\u2014as McTaggart himself admits (1924 [1934: 271\nf.])\u2014rather mystical-sounding assertions, which he adhered to\nall his life, he tries to back up by a number of different\nconsiderations. In his earliest writing he relies heavily on views\nheld by Bradley to the effect that we have to accept that\ncontradictions are a criterion for non-reality. However, he does not\nemploy this criterion as a logical maxim but transforms it into an\nontological principle according to which everything that prevents\nharmony cannot be real. In his last work, his attempt to present an\nargument for his ontological idealism is based mainly on (1)\nmereological considerations concerning the structure of substances\nwhich aim to show that only spirits can claim the status of a\nsubstance, and on (2) his theory of time, the unreality of which he\nfamously had proven in his magnum opus The Nature of\nExistence (1921/27). In the first volume of this work he attempts\nto prove by a priori reasoning (NE \u00a743) that\nall that really exists are substances. Substances according to\nMcTaggart are infinitely divisible and therefore cannot have simple\nparts. Between substances and their individual features there obtains\na relation of determining correspondence such that each feature\ndetermines and is determined by all the other. Given these a\npriori characteristics of what can exist the task McTaggart\ntackles in the second volume is to \n\n\nconsider various characteristics as to which our experience gives us\n\u2026 a prima facie suggestion that they are possessed either by\nall that exists, or by some existent things (NE \u00a7295)\n\n\n\nand to ask \n\n \u201cwhich of these characteristics can really be possessed by\nwhat is existent\u201d and \n \u201cof those which are found to be possible characteristics of\nthe existent, whether any of them can be known to be actual\ncharacteristics of it\u201d (NE \u00a7295). \n\n\nThis double task cannot be settled by a priori means but has\nto be approached by starting from empirical assumptions based on\nexperience. If one has to acknowledge that the ways we are bound to\nconceive of all these experiential or phenomenal characteristics lead\nto contradictions then these characteristics cannot be true of\nreality. McTaggart\u2019s strategy here is strongly reminiscent of\nBradley\u2019s procedure to downgrade many phenomena to appearances\nand to deny them the status of constitutive elements of reality. The\nempirically given characteristics McTaggart discusses primarily are\n(a) time, (b) matter, (c) sensa, (d) spirit and (e) cogitation. As to\n(a) time he denies that \u201canything existent [can] possess the\ncharacteristic of being in time\u201d (NE \u00a7303) where\ntime is understood as an ordering relation between events. He\ndistinguishes between two ways of ordering in time. The first gives\nrise to what he calls the \u201cA-series\u201d according to which\nevery state of affairs (event, thing) is either past or present or\nfuture. The second, the so-called \u201cB-series\u201d, relates\ntransitively and asymmetrically states of affairs in terms of earlier\nand later (cf. NE \u00a7306). He claims that the A-series is\nmore fundamental than the B-series because only the A-series can\naccount for change (NE \u00a7317) and goes on to demonstrate\nthat (a) the A-series and the B-series contradict each other in the\nsense that they belong together though they are incompatible (cf.\nNE \u00a7333) and that (b) the (more fundamental) A-series\nleads to time determinations of a state of affairs that are\ncontradictory. The result: \n\n\nWe conclude that the distinctions of past, present and future are\nessential to time, and that, if the distinctions are never true of\nreality, then no reality is in time. (NE \u00a7324) \n\n\nThough never true of reality these distinctions are not empty because\naccording to McTaggart they have to be taken as appearances of a third\nseries, the C-series, \u201ca series which is not a time series, but\nunder certain conditions appears to us to be one\u201d. This C-series\n\u201cdoes actually exist in every case in which there is the\nappearance of a time-series\u201d (NE \u00a7347). McTaggart\nthinks of the C-series (at least in The Nature of Existence)\nas an \u201cInclusion Series\u201d (NE \u00a7575) \n\n\nwhose members are connected by the relations \u201cinclusive\nof\u201d and \u201cinclusive in\u201d, so that of any two terms one\nwill be inclusive of the other, and the other will be included in it.\n(NE \u00a7575) \n\n\nConcerning (b) matter which he characterizes as \u201csomething which\npossesses the primary qualities\u201d (NE \u00a7355) he also\nwants to prove that it does not exist (NE \u00a7364). This is\nso because all that exists are substances that have to be infinitely\ndivisible. Matter, however, \n\n\ncannot be divided into parts of parts to infinity either in respect of\nits spatial dimensions, or of that dimension which appears as\ntemporal. And matter, as usually defines, and as we have defined it,\nhas no other dimensions. \u2026 And therefore it cannot exist.\n(NE \u00a7362) \n\n\nThe existence of matter can also not be inferred on the basis of the\nprima facie existence of what I perceive \u201cby means of the sense\norgans of our bodies\u201d, i.e., of what he calls\n\u201csensa\u201d (NE \u00a7373), because it is erroneous\nto believe that matter as the presumed outside cause of a sensum has\nthe same qualities as a sensum and thus has to exist (NE\n\u00a7365). He conjectures that if there are outside causes of sensa\nthey must be substances which are \u201cof a spiritual nature\u201d\n(NE \u00a7371). When it comes to (c) sensa McTaggart holds\nthat one has to distinguish between two classes of percepta, those\nperceived by introspection (mental states, spiritual data) and those\nthat are given by means of sense organs (sensa). The latter do not\nreally exist, they just lead to the illusion that they exist. This is\nso because of a confusion between a perception that is part of the\npercipient and therefore spiritual or mental in character and what is\nperceived, i.e., the object of a perception or the perceptum\n(NE \u00a7373). However, a perceptum as a sensum cannot,\naccording to McTaggart, have parts within parts to infinity and thus\ncannot really exist because what exists has no simple parts (cf. 355).\nHaving disposed of matter and sensa this way, he then discusses the\nontological status of (d) spirit or spirituality. He declares that\n\u201cthe quality of spirituality \u2026 is the quality of having\ncontent, all of which is the content of one or more selves\u201d\n(NE \u00a7381) and states that \u201cnothing can have this\nquality except substances, and so nothing but substances are\nspiritual\u201d and exist or are real (ibid.). A self or an I he\ntakes to be a simple quality of a substance which is known to me to be\nmyself by direct perception, i.e., is known by acquaintance, not by\ndescription. The distinction between knowledge by acquaintance and\nknowledge by description he explicitly takes up from Russell\n(NE \u00a7382). He then surmises that it is very likely that\nthe I, i.e., the substance that possesses the quality of being a self,\npersists through time because \u201cI perceive myself as persisting\nthrough time, or the real series which appears as a time-series\u201d\n(NE \u00a7395). He also holds that selves are conscious\nwithout having to be self-conscious (NE \u00a7397) and that\nno experience is possible \u201cwhich is not part of a self\u201d\n(NE \u00a7400) though it cannot belong to more than one self\n(NE \u00a7401). He concludes: \n\n\nAs all the content of spirit falls within some self, and none of it\nfalls within more than one self, it follows that all existent selves\nform a set of parts of that whole which consists of all existent\nspirits. (NE \u00a7404) \n\n\nAlthough written more than twenty years after G. E. Moore\u2019s\n\u201cThe Refutation of Idealism\u201d (see below) and without\nmentioning him at all, McTaggart thus arrives at the exact opposite to\nthe conclusion that Moore defended. Regarding (e) cogitations which\ncomprise perceptions, awarenesses of characteristics, judgments,\nassumptions, imaginings, only perceptions can form an infinite series\nrequired for existence (NE \u00a7406). Perception he\ncharacterizes as awareness of a substance as having such and\nsuch qualities (NE \u00a7407). The outcome he wants to have\nreached so far is this: \n\n\n\u2026 spirit, unlike matter and sense, can really exist. But it can\ndo so only if it contains no parts except perceptions and groups of\nperceptions. (NE \u00a7426) \n\n\nAll these considerations as to the character or the nature of time,\nmatter, sensa, spirit and cogitations are meant to establish two\nresults. The first is \u201cthat nothing which is spiritual is also\n\u201cmaterial or sensal\u201d (sic) [although this result]\nleaves it possible that what is really spiritual may appear\nas being material or sensal\u201d (NE \u00a7431). The second\nis McTaggart\u2019s version of idealism: \n\n\nNo substance has material or sensal qualities, and all reality is\nspirit. This conclusion I propose \u2026 to call by the name of\nIdealism (NE \u00a7432) \n\n\nin an ontological sense though, as he remarks, the terms\n\u201cSpiritualism\u201d or \u201cPsychism\u201d might be\n\u201cintrinsically better\u201d to characterize his point of view\n(NE \u00a7432). It is interesting to note that McTaggart does\nnot believe that his metaphysical (ontological) spiritual idealism\nexcludes a realistic stance in epistemology. This is so because he\ncharacterizes epistemological realism as a position that is based on a\ncorrespondence theory of truth according to which a belief is true if\nit corresponds to a fact. Because everything that is real is a fact\nand (according to McTaggart) nothing is unreal (although it may not\nexist), all beliefs about something are beliefs about facts and\nconsequently about something that is epistemologically real. Although\nthis concept of epistemological realism is vague, it suggests that\nMcTaggart thought of idealism not primarily in opposition to realism\nbut much more in terms of a doctrine that is opposed to materialism,\nthat is, as an ontological rather than epistemological doctrine.\nHowever, since McTaggart makes clear that since matter and mind are\nthe only candidates for genuine substantiality of which we\nknow, and thus that while only mind or spirit satisfies the\nontological conditions for substantiality, for all we know\nthere might be some other alternative, so his argument for idealism is\nnot conclusive. His argument is predominantly ontological, but does\npresuppose one crucial epistemological premise.\n\nIdealism was also a prominent mode of philosophy in the United States\nduring the late nineteenth century, alongside pragmatism, but while\npragmatism remained prominent throughout the twentieth century,\nwhether under that name or not, the reputation of idealism was\npermanently damaged by a movement toward \u201crealism\u201d early\nin the century (which also attacked pragmatism, although without the\nsame effect). Earlier in the nineteenth century, the popular essayist\nRalph Waldo Emerson, the most philosophical of the New England\n\u201cTranscendentalists\u201d, had struck many idealist themes, and\nafter the Civil War a school of \u201cSt. Louis Hegelians\u201d\nemerged, whose efforts were primarily exegetical. But the leading\nAmerican idealist was Josiah Royce (1855\u20131916). Deeply\ninfluenced by Charles Sanders Peirce, particularly the lectures that\nPeirce gave in Cambridge in 1898, Royce incorporated aspects of\nPeirce\u2019s pragmatism into his version of idealism, giving an\nidealist spin to Peirce\u2019s conception of truth as what would be\nknown at the end of inquiry were that ever to be reached. But\nRoyce\u2019s argument always remained that epistemology must\nultimately lead to what he himself called metaphysical idealism.\n\nA prolific author who published fifteen books before his early death\nat sixty, Royce launched his defense of idealism in his first book,\nThe Religious Aspect of Philosophy (1885). In this work he\nintroduced his first novel argument, for idealism, what he called the\nargument from error. Royce\u2019s claim is that skepticism begins\nwith insistence upon the possibility of error, but that recognition of\nthat possibility presupposes not just that there is\n\u201cabsolute truth\u201d (1885: 385) but that in some sense we\nhave to know that absolute truth, or at least some aspect of\nit, in order to have an object even for our erroneous claims, thus\nthat we must have some access to a \u201chigher inclusive\nthought\u201d even to make an erroneous knowledge claim. In his\nwords,\n\n\nEither then there is no error, or else judgments are true and false\nonly in reference to a higher inclusive thought, which they\npresuppose, and which must, in the last analysis, be assumed as\nInfinite and all-inclusive. (1885: 393)\n\n\nRoyce holds that we must have some sort of apprehension of the\n\u201chigher inclusive thought\u201d in order to be able even to\nmake our errors, and then that the growth of human knowledge over time\nconsists in increasing apprehension of this all-inclusive truth\nwithout any limit being prescribed by our subordinate status. This is\nthe epistemological optimism that pervades all Royce\u2019s work and\nhis subsequent debate with Bradley.\n\nThis account does not yet make clear why Royce thought that\nepistemology must lead to ontological idealism; that becomes clearer\nin his subsequent works. Royce\u2019s next major statement of his\nidealism came in The Spirit of Modern Philosophy (1892). The\nsecond part of the book more fully develops Royce\u2019s own\narguments for idealism. Here Royce gives a clear definition of his\nconception of idealism and adds to the previous argument from error a\nsecond argument, from meaning. The core of this argument is that the\nintended object of an expression or thought must itself be conceived\nor understood in some way, so that we always mean what are in some\nsense our own ideas, although of course at any particular moment we\nhardly know or understand everything about the object to which we\nrefer; that is why the idea that is the ultimate object of reference\nmay be much greater than the idea that refers. In Royce\u2019s\nwords,\n\n\nThe self that is doubting or asserting, or that is even feeling its\nprivate ignorance about an object, and that still, even in consequence\nof all this, is meaning, is aiming at such an\nobject, is in essence identical with the self for which this object\nexists in its complete and consciously known truth. (1892:\n370\u20131)\n\n\nBy means of this argument, any restriction of Royce\u2019s position\nto a purely epistemological one is eliminated: the possibility of\nmeaning requires an identity between what means and what is meant, and\nsince anything might be meant, anything at all must in some way be\nidentical with what means, subjects and their ideas and expressions,\neven though that identity can hardly be absolute, and the ordinary\nconscious subject may seem very different and more limited than the\n\u201cone Self\u201d (1892: 373) that underlies the\nappearances of both ordinary subjects and ordinary objects.\n\nRoyce develops an even more systematic argument for an idealism that\nis both epistemological and ontological in his magnum opus,\nthe two volumes of his 1899\u20131900 Gifford lectures published as\nThe World and the Individual. As the title suggests, a major\ntheme of this work is explicating in detail the relationship between\nunderlying reality and ordinary individual, conscious human selves. In\nthis book, Royce expounds his idealism as the last of the four\npossible \u201cconceptions of being\u201d. The first is the\n\u201crealistic conception of Being\u201d, which is defined by the\nconception of being as completely independent of thought, so\nthat whatever is true of it is true quite independently of what may be\nthought about it. The second conception of being is the mystical\nconception. As the defining notion of the realist conception was\nindependence, the defining notion of mysticism is the opposite, namely\nimmediacy, the idea that thought and its object must be one. The third\nconception of being, which Royce sometimes calls the theory of\n\u201cvalidity\u201d, is that \u201cTo be real now means,\nprimarily, to be valid, to be true, to be in essence the standard\nfor ideas\u201d (I:202). This conception of being tries to\nretain realism\u2019s recognition of independence through the thought\nthat \u201csome of my ideas are already, and apart from my private\nexperience, valid, true, well-grounded\u201d (I:204) and\nmysticism\u2019s identification of subject and object through the\nthought that reality is itself possible experience, but adds structure\nto the now unified realms of thought and being instead of eliminating\nstructure.\n\nThe fourth conception of being is a fuller development of the\nconception of meaning that Royce had introduced in The Spirit of\nModern Philosophy (1892). He now links meaning to purpose, and\nhis thought is that the meaning of a term is an intended purpose, a\nproblem to be solved, for example a mathematical problem to be solved\nor object to be constructed, and that in using a term the user already\nhas some approach to solving the problem in mind but the full solution\nremains to be developed, may never be fully developed in the life of a\nparticular individual, but is in some sense already included in the\nlarger thought that constitutes reality. Reaching back to both Hegel\nand Kant, Royce conceives of the progress of knowledge as making the\nmeaning of our ideas more determinate. In this he is also influenced\nby Peirce, and his notion of meaning is clearly a version of\nPeirce\u2019s approach to truth, on which a proposition is true if it\nwould be affirmed at the final stage of human inquiry, with the\ndifference that while for Peirce the final stage of human enquiry is\nessentially a regulative ideal without ontological commitment, for\nRoyce, the comprehensive meaning in which all ideas would be fully\ndeterminate is actually thought, although by a sort of super-self, not\nby any particular finite human self or even by all the selves thinking\nat any one time. Royce makes the transition from thought to being by\nstating that\n\n\nIn its wholeness the world of Being is the world of individually\nexpressed meanings, an individual life, consisting of the individual\nembodiments of the wills represented by all finite ideas. (1892:\nI:341\u20132)\n\n\nRoyce\u2019s arguments for idealism collectively, which in many ways\nreturn to the basic form of modern idealism pioneered by Green, whose\nProlegomena had been published just a couple of years before\nRoyce\u2019s own career began, illustrate the pressure that often\nforced a move from epistemology to an idealist ontology. The\nepistemological argument begins with the insight that our knowledge in\nsome way or another always reflects the structure of our own\nconsciousness and thought. But the difference between what any\nparticular individual believes or even knows at any particular time\nand what may be true and be known as a whole, at a time or over time,\nis too great to ignore, and must be resolved. But once it has been\nassumed that thought or mind itself is the proper object of knowledge,\nthe only way to do this is to make a contrast between individual\nthought and some sort of supra-individual thought. At the outset of\nmodern idealism, in Berkeley, that takes the form of the infinite\nmind, God, contrasted to individual, human minds; in later forms, such\nas those of Green and Royce, the supra-individual mind is not always\nidentified with God, but plays the same role. In the cases of both\nGreen and Royce, the union of epistemology and ontology also provided\nthe basis for a moral idealism based on an insistence upon the\nunderlying commonality of individual human selves in the larger self\nthat Royce called the Absolute. But we will not be able to trace that\nline of thought here, and will instead conclude with the suggestion\nthat many subsequent philosophers drew back from the full-blooded\nidealism offered by Green, Bradley, McTaggart, and Royce in favor of\nwhat was supposed to be an ontological realism, but which nevertheless\ncontinued to harbor at least epistemological grounds for idealism.\nThis might seem a surprising claim, since the immediate response both\nto the British idealists and to Royce in the U.S. came from\nphilosophers who identified themselves as realists. A case in point\nwould be Bertrand Russell.\n\nBefore we turn to Russell, however, we will pause for a look at\nCharles Sanders Peirce (1839\u20131914), who, as already suggested,\nwas a considerable influence on the later work of Royce. Whereas Royce\nwas convinced that epistemology must ultimately lead to metaphysical\nidealism, Peirce was led in his philosophical development from\nmetaphysical realism to metaphysical idealism while supporting all the\nway what has here been characterized as an epistemological ground for\nidealism. Peirce, definitely the most original American philosopher of\nhis era, was the son of a famous Harvard mathematician. He was a fired\nfrom a teaching post at Johns Hopkins because he had the temerity to\nbegin residence with the woman who would become his second wife before\nhis divorce from his first wife had been finalized, and was never able\nto get another academic position. He thus had to spend much of his\ncareer as an employee of United States Coast and Geodetic Survey, and\nthen lived his final years in independent but dire circumstances,\nsupported in part by subscription lecture series that William James\narranged for him to give in Cambridge. Although he was highly\nrecognized and even supported by many of his academically much more\nsuccessful philosophical contemporaries, among them Royce and James,\nand although he produced an impressive amount of writing (the Peirce\nEdition Project that is in charge of publishing his writings will, if\never finished, contain more than twenty volumes) he never succeeded in\nelaborating his ideas in book form. Instead he published most of his\nwork in intellectual and learned journals (Proceedings der\nAmerican Academy of Arts and Sciences, Journal of Speculative\nPhilosophy, The Nation, Popular Science, The Monist, The Open\nCourt) and encyclopedias (Baldwin\u2019s The Century\nDictionary and Cyclopedia). There are also quite a number of\nmanuscripts he wrote for different lecture series but never published.\nThey comprise the early Harvard lectures on The Logic of\nScience (1865) and the early Lowell Lectures on the same topic\n(1866) as well as the Cambridge Lectures on Reasoning and the\nLogic of Things (1898) and the later Harvard lectures on\nPragmatism (1903).\n\nPeirce\u2019s metaphysical view are intimately connected with his\nclaim \u201cthat logic is the science of representations in general,\nwhether mental or material\u201d (Chronological Edition =\nCE 1.169) and with his stipulations concerning the structure\nand status of what he calls \u201crepresentation\u201d. In his early\nwritings, while trying to answer the question as to the grounds of the\nobjective validity of synthetic inferences (a question which he takes\nto be at the center of Kant\u2019s theoretical philosophy), he\ndevelops a notion of representation according to which \n\n\n[A] representation is anything which is supposed to stand for another\nand which might express that other to a mind which truly could\nunderstand it. (CE 1.257) \n\n\nThis characterization of a representation is supposed to make the\nrepresentation \u201cmind-independent\u201d, so to speak: \n\n\ninstead of being restricted to something within the mind, [the\nrepresentation] is extended to things which do not even address the\nmind. (CE 1.323) \n\n\nPeirce might have come to this conception of a representation by\nrelying on a phenomenological analysis of what he takes to be\nconstitutive of every experience. For him \n\n\nexperience has three determinations\u2014three different references\nto a substratum or substrata, lying behind it and determining it.\n(CE 1.168) \n\n\nThis is so because every experience is determined (1) by an external\nobject, (2) by our soul and (3) by \u201cthe idea of a universal\nmind\u201d (an \u201carchetypal idea\u201d). Within representations\nhe distinguishes in the early writings between a copy (\u201ca\nrepresentation whose agreement with its object depends merely upon\nsameness of predicates\u201d, CE 1.257), a sign (\u201ca\nrepresentation whose reference to its object is fixed by\nconvention\u201d, CE 1.257) and a symbol (\u201ca\nrepresentation whose correspondence with its object is of the same\nimmaterial kind as a sign but is founded nevertheless in its very\nnature\u201d CE 1.323). Later he changed the terminology and\nused instead of \u201ccopy\u201d and \u201csign\u201d the terms\n\u201cIcon\u201d and \u201cIndex\u201d, which led to his better\nknown distinction between Icon, Index and Symbol as different kinds of\nrepresentations. Each of these different kinds is determined by a\ndifference in its way of denoting and/or connoting its object while\nall of them share the characteristics of having to have (1) a relation\nto an object (2) under a specific form (e.g., similarity, by\nconvention) and (3) a relation to an interpretant, i.e., to a\n\u201cconsciousness\u201d (cf. CE 1.272 f.). From his\nanalysis of the nature of a representation Peirce draws the\nmetaphysical conclusion that \u201c[w]hatever is is a\nrepresentation\u201d (CE 1.324) or \u201call is\nrepresentation\u201d (CE 1.326). He arrives at this\nconclusion in a somewhat obscure way that seems to be based on the\nconviction that everything there is represents itself or is a\nrepresentation of itself under an interpretation. Peirce does\nnot immediately recognize his position as a form of idealism. Rather,\nbecause representations are neutral with respect to their status of\nbeing material or mental he can think of material objects as\nrepresentations whose interpretant is either the representation itself\nor some (non-human) consciousness for which the representation can\nfunction as a symbol, and he can think of mental items like general\nterms or concepts as universals that exist \u201cout there\u201d in\na world that comprises next to copies and conventional signs what he\ncalls ideas (cf. CE 1.168). However, it is obvious that this\nview commits Peirce to a position that implies the (metaphysical)\nreality of universals, a position he explicitly and happily endorses\n(cf. CE 1.358 ff.). And the very fact that every\nrepresentation has both a denotative and a connotative function makes\nthe basic epistemological premise for idealism, namely the necessary\nisomorphism between knowledge and the known, an element of his\nview.\n\nWhereas in his earlier writings Peirce is very explicit about the\nmetaphysical/ontological implications of his representational\nposition, he is reluctant to go into metaphysical discussions in his\nlater writings, where he is primarily concerned with formulating and\ndefending his conception of Pragmatism. Instead he urges that his\nPragmatism is not a metaphysical doctrine and is in fact\nmetaphysically neutral. In a draft of a popular article on Pragmatism\n(1907), never published in his lifetime, he writes \n\n\nthat pragmatism is, in itself, no doctrine of metaphysics, no attempt\nto determine any truth of things. It is merely a method of\nascertaining the meanings of hard words and of abstract concepts.\n(The Essential Peirce = EP 2.400) \n\n\nHe proclaims, most unambiguously in his Harvard lectures on\nPragmatism (1903), that one can establish Pragmatism as a\nmethodological maxim on the basis of epistemological (in later years:\nsemiotic) considerations that have to start from a phenomenological\nanalysis of experience. To provide this analysis is the task of what\nhe calls Phenomenology (used explicitly in allusion to Hegel, cf.\nEP 2.143 f.) which is in Peirce\u2019s taxonomy the first of\nthe main branches of philosophy because on it rest what he takes to be\nthe other branches of philosophy, i.e., normative science and\nmetaphysics (cf. EP 2.146 f.). Phenomenology is the\ndiscipline \n\n\nwhose task is to make out what are the elements of appearance that\npresent themselves to us every hour and every minute whether we are\npursuing earnest investigations, or are undergoing the strangest\nvicissitudes of experience, or are dreamily listening to the tales of\nScheherazade. (EP 2.147) \n\n\nAccording to Peirce, phenomenological considerations, i.e.,\nconsiderations spelled out in the Phenomenology, show that in whatever\ncan be experienced there are at least two distinct series of\ncategories involved that make this experience possible. Some of them\nare universal, i.e., are constitutive of every phenomenon, others\nparticular, i.e., belong to a phenomenon if looked at under a specific\naspect (cf. EP 2.148) like its quantitative, qualitative,\nrelational etc. determinations. As universal categories he identifies\nthree which he names Firstness/Category the First/First,\nSecondness/Category the Second/Second, and Thirdness/Category the\nThird/Third respectively. He defines them thus: \n\n\nCategory the First is the Idea of that which is such as it is\nregardless of anything else. That is to say, it is a Quality\nof Feeling. Category the Second is the Idea of that which is such as\nit is as being Second to some First, regardless of anything else and\nin particular regardless of any law, although it may conform\nto a law. That is to say, it is Reaction as an element of the\nPhenomenon. Category the Third is the Idea of that which is such as it\nis as being a Third, or Medium, between a Second and its First. That\nis to say, it is Representation as an element of the\nPhenomenon. (EP 2.160) \n\n\nThese definitions are meant to capture what is essential to every\nphenomenon. They are interpreted in more familiar terms by Peirce as\nattributing to every phenomenon the characteristics of presentness or\nimmediacy (Firstness), struggle or resistance (Secondness) and what\nmay be described as general openness to conceptual interpretation\n(Thirdness) as fundamental and irreducible features. Peirce is ready\nto credit Hegel with a similar view (\u201cI consider Hegel\u2019s\nthree stages as being, roughly speaking, the correct list of Universal\nCategories\u201d, EP 2.148). However, he criticizes Hegel\nfor mistakenly not allowing these categories to be independent of each\nother. He believes that the reason for this failure on Hegel\u2019s\npart lies in his being \n\n\npossessed with the idea that the Absolute is One. \u2026\nConsequently, he wishes to make out that the three categories have not\ntheir several independent and irrefutable standings in thought.\nFirstness and Secondness must somehow be aufgehoben.\n(EP 2.177) \n\n\nAlthough this criticism might be justified from a Peircean\nphenomenological point of view it poses at the same time a problem for\nhim because he now has to give an account of how the professed\nindependence of his universal categories can be integrated into his\ngeneral representational picture of reality, a picture according to\nwhich everything that is real has to have the character of Thirdness\nand therefore is somehow related to everything else in virtue of its\ninterpretative or representational character, i.e., in virtue of its\nstatus as an interpretant.\n\nIt looks as if Peirce in his later years (after ca. 1905) tried to\nsolve this problem by giving his phenomenological claims a\nmetaphysical underpinning. For him metaphysics is that part of\nphilosophy that gives an account of the results of what\nphilosophy in the form of Phenomenology and as a normative science has\naccomplished. Here Peirce exploits the fundamental idealist premise\nthat there is a necessary isomorphism between thought and being:\naccording to him, \n\n\n[m]etaphysics consists in the results of the absolute acceptance of\nlogical principles not merely as regulatively valid, but as truths of\nbeing. Accordingly, it is to be assumed that the universe has an\nexplanation, the function of which, like that of every logical\nexplanation, is to unify its observed variety. It follows that the\nroot of all being is One; and so far as different subjects have a\ncommon character they partake of an identical being. This, or\nsomething like this, is the monadic clause of the law. Second, drawing\na general induction from all observed facts, we find all realization\nof existence lies in opposition, such as attractions, repulsions,\nvisibilities, and centres of potentiality generally\u2026. This is,\nor is a part of, a dyadic clause of the law. Under the third clause,\nwe have, as a deduction from the principle that thought is the mirror\nof being, the law that the end of being and highest reality is the\nliving impersonation of the idea that evolution generates.\n(CP 1.487) \n\n\nThe term \u201claw\u201d in this characterization is equivalent to\nwhat he terms \u201cregularity\u201d \u201cin the universe of\nrepresentations\u201d (cf. CP 1.480). The specific\nversion of metaphysics he is advocating shows up in his writings in\nthe shape of what he calls his doctrine of Synechism. He\ndefines Synechism as \n\n\nthat tendency of philosophical thought which insists upon the idea of\ncontinuity as of prime importance in philosophy and, in particular,\nupon the necessity of hypotheses involving true continuity. (Collected\nPapers = CP 6.169) \n\n\nThis synechistic doctrine, he declares, \n\n\ngives room for explanations of many facts which without it are\nabsolutely and hopelessly inexplicable; and further that it carries\nalong with it the following doctrines: first, a logical realism of the\nmost pronounced type; second, objective idealism; third, tychism, with\nits consequent thorough-going evolutionism. We also notice that the\ndoctrine presents no hindrances to spiritual influences, such as some\nphilosophies are felt to do. (CP 6.163) \n\n\nTychism \u201cor the doctrine that absolute chance is a factor of the\nuniverse\u201d (CP 6.201) he takes to be an essential\nelement of synechistic philosophy because it \n\n\nmust give birth to an evolutionary cosmology, in which all the\nregularities of nature and of mind are regarded as products of growth,\nand to a Schelling-fashioned idealism which holds matter to be mere\nspecialized and partially deadened mind. (CP 5.102) \n\n\nHe is committed to objective idealism as well as to logical realism\nbecause of his view that (to use a phrase favored very much by\nBradley) \u201cin the end\u201d everything there is is a\nrepresentation. It is within this synechistic framework based on\ntychism that, according to Peirce, the independence of Firstness and\nSecondness can be shown to be a necessary condition for Thirdness.\nThis is so because continuity (which he identifies with Thirdness) and\nchance (as the organizing principle of evolution) could not be\naccounted for if there were no independence of the three universal\ncategories. He is very explicit about this connection between his\nmetaphysical and his representational views when he writes: \n\n\nPermit me further to say that I object to having my metaphysical\nsystem as a whole called Tychism. For although tychism does enter into\nit, it only enters as subsidiary to that which is really, as I regard\nit, the characteristic of my doctrine, namely, that I chiefly insist\nupon continuity, or Thirdness, and, in order to secure to Thirdness\nits really commanding function, I find it indispensable fully [to]\nrecognize that it is a third, and that Firstness, or chance, and\nSecondness, or Brute reaction, are other elements, without the\nindependence of which Thirdness would not have anything upon which to\noperate. Accordingly, I like to call my theory Synechism, because it\nrests on the study of continuity. (CP 6.202) \n\n\nIn virtue of the robust idealistic elements contained in his synechism\nit is safe to say that Peirce\u2019s final philosophy exhibits all\nthe traits that are characteristic of metaphysical idealism prevalent\nin Anglo-American philosophy at the turn of the twentieth century.\n9. The Fate of Idealism in the Twentieth Century\n\nBoth epistemological and ontological idealism came under massive\nattack in Britain at the turn of the twentieth century by George\nEdward Moore (1873\u20131958) and Bertrand Russell (1872\u20131970),\nwhile in the United States Royce\u2019s position was attacked by a\nschool of younger \u201cNew Realists\u201d, to some extent inspired\nby his life-long interlocutor William James, who included E.B. Holt\nand his younger Harvard colleague Ralph Barton Perry, and later Roy\nWood Sellars (the father of Wilfrid Sellars, who later moved back to a\nform of Kantianism), and Arthur Lovejoy. Both Moore and Russell had\nmore of an enduring influence on the course of analytic philosophy\nthan did the American New Realists, but also reveal the continuing\nimpulse to idealism in spite of their own efforts, so we will focus on\nthem. Both of them take idealism to be spiritualism in the spirit of\nBerkeley and Bradley (neither of them mentions their own Cambridge\ntutor McTaggart!), i.e., they think of idealism as a position\ncharacterized by the claim that the universe (Moore) or whatever\nexists or whatever can be known to exist (Russell) is spiritual\n(Moore) or in some sense mental (Russell). Although their attack was\nso influential that even more than a hundred years later, any\nacknowledgment of idealistic tendencies is viewed in the\nEnglish-speaking world with reservation, it is by no means obvious\nthat they actually thought they had disproved idealism. On the\ncontrary, neither Moore nor Russell claimed to have demonstrated that\nthe universe or what exists or can be known to exist is not spiritual\nor mental. All that they take themselves to have shown is that there\nare no good philosophical (in contradistinction to, e.g., theological\nor psychological) arguments available to support such a claim. Moore\nespecially is very explicit about this point. He devotes the first\nfive pages of his famous piece from 1903, \u201cThe Refutation of\nIdealism\u201d, to assuring the reader over and over that\n\n\nI do not suppose that anything I shall say has the smallest tendency\nto prove that reality is not spiritual. \u2026 Reality may be\nspiritual, for all I know; and I devoutly hope it is. \u2026 It is,\ntherefore, only with idealistic arguments that I am\nconcerned; \u2026 I shall have proved that Idealists have no\nreason whatever for their conclusion. (Philosophical\nStudies, pp. 2 f.)\n\n\nAnd Russell in his The Problems of Philosophy (1912), in a\nsimilar vein, warns the reader, after emphasizing the strangeness of\nan idealistic position from a common sense point of view:\n\n\n[I]f there were good reasons to regard them [viz. physical objects] as\nmental, we could not legitimately reject this opinion merely because\nit strikes us as strange. (1912 [1974: 38])\n\n\nMoore and Russell found two main arguments for idealism to be\nfallacious. The first concerns Berkeley\u2019s idealistic principle\nthat being consists in being perceived, the second the converse claim,\nattributed to Bradley, that thought entails being. Their criticism of\nthe first as well as their rebuttal of the second argument stems from\ncertain convictions they share as to the nature of knowledge. The\nassault on Berkeley is staged by Moore most extensively in \u201cThe\nRefutation of Idealism\u201d (1903). Here he holds that if there is\nan argument to prove the idealistic claim that the universe is\nspiritual (1903: 433) then this reasoning must rely either at the\nbeginning or at some point later in the argument on the premise\nesse est percipi: \n\n\nI believe that every argument ever used to show that reality is\nspiritual has inferred this (validly or invalidly) from\n\u201cesse is percipere\u201d as one of its\npremisses; and that this again has never been pretended to be proved\nexcept by use of the premiss that esse is percipi.\n(1903: 437) \n\n\nAccording to Moore the proposition esse is percipi\n\u201cdoes at least assert that whatever is, is\nexperienced\u201d (1903: 437) which is meant in turn to\nassert \n\n\nthat wherever you have x [esse] you also have\npercipi; that whatever has the property x also has\nthe property that it is experienced. (1903: 440) \n\n\nAfter a lengthy analysis of this proposition he points out that the\nconception of the connection between an experience and what is\nexperienced that the idealist is entertaining has tenuous consequences\nthat give rise to the question: \n\n\nif we never experience anything but what is not an inseparable aspect\nof that experience, how can we infer that anything whatever,\nlet alone everything is an inseparable aspect of any\nexperience? (1903: 451) \n\n\nAn inference to such a conclusion cannot be justified. He concludes\nthat in order to avoid an idealistic position one is better off to\nendorse a view according to which \n\n\nI am as directly aware of the existence of material things in space as\nof my own sensations, and what I am aware of with regard to\neach is exactly the same\u2014namely that in one case the material\nthing, and in the other case my sensation does really exist (1903:\n453) \n\n\nThis line of reasoning, remarkably similar to what Kant had argued in\nthe Fourth Antinomy in the first edition of the Critique of Pure\nReason but rejected as an inadequate refutation of idealism in\nthe second edition, was picked up in an abbreviated form by Russell\nten years later in the chapter on idealism in his The Problems of\nPhilosophy, while the attack on Bradley, although foreshadowed in\nRussell\u2019s Problems, is spelled out rather lengthily\n(and a bit nastily) by Moore in \u201cThe Conception of\nReality\u201d from 1917\u201318. Their main objection against the\ntwo idealistic arguments seems to be that they rely on unjustly\npresupposing that the mental act of relating to an object (perceiving,\nthinking, knowing, experiencing) is a necessary condition for the\nexistence of this object. The fallacy involved here consists in\nfailing to make \u201cthe distinction between act and object in our\napprehending of things\u201d, as Russell (1912 [1974: 42]) puts it,\nor, in Moore\u2019s terminology of The Refutation, in\nwrongfully identifying the content of \u201cconsciousness\u201d with\nits object (1912 [1974: 19 ff.]). As soon as this identification is given up and that\ndistinction is made it is at least an open question whether things\nexist independently of the mind, and idealism insofar it neglects\nthis distinction and holds fast to that identification is refuted\nbecause based on an invalid argument.\n\nWhether this line of criticism of idealistic positions is indeed\nsuccessful might be controversial, and even if it strikes home against\nBerkeley the charge that they simply conflate knowledge and object\nhardly seems to do justice to the elaborate arguments of the late\nnineteenth-century idealists. However, if one is convinced of the\ncorrectness of this criticism (as no doubt Moore and Russell were)\nthen it makes way for interesting new perspectives in epistemology and\nmetaphysics. This is so because if this criticism is taken to be\nsuccessful it permits us to explore the possibility of a theory of\nknowledge that starts from the assumptions (a) that objects exist\nindependently of us and (b) that to know an object means to be\nimmediately related to the object as it is in itself (i.e., as it is\nundistorted by and independent from any mental activity). Both Moore\nand Russell can be understood to have embarked on this exploration in\nthe course of which they came to conceive a position which is aptly\ncalled by Peter Hylton \u201cPlatonic Atomism\u201d (2013: 329).\n\nThe basic idea of this Platonic atomism seems to be the following:\nKnowledge consists in standing in an immediate relation to an\nindependent individual object (assumption b). This immediate relation\nto individual objects is best known under Russell\u2019s term\n\u201cacquaintance\u201d. If, by stipulation, knowledge is\nultimately knowledge \u201cby acquaintance\u201d, then knowledge is\nrestricted to knowledge of individual objects. Knowledge basically is\nknowledge of something or non-propositional knowledge.\nHowever, although this rather frugal conception of knowledge might be\nsufficient to give an account of the possibility of non-propositional\nknowledge, it is not that easy to see how such a conception can give a\nsensible explanation of propositional knowledge, i.e., of knowledge\nthat something is so-and-so. Moore and Russell seem to have\nbeen acutely aware of this difficulty as is documented in their very\nexplicit efforts to avoid it. It might have been their different\nreactions to this difficulty which in the years to come led them to\nproceed on diverging routes in philosophy. As is easy to imagine,\nthere are two obvious reactions to the problem of propositional\nknowledge provided that assumption (b) is agreed upon. The first is to\nclaim that propositions (Moore prefers the term \u201cjudgment\u201d\nin this context) are individual objects with which the subject is\nacquainted (if he or she claims to know that something is\nso-and-so). The second is to broaden the concept of knowledge by not\nrestricting knowledge to knowledge by acquaintance but to allow for\nother forms of knowledge as well. The first reaction\napparently was the reaction of Moore and is formulated most\nprominently in his early piece \u201cThe Nature of Judgment\u201d\n(1899), while the second can be attributed to Russell and is\ndocumented most vividly in his The Problems of\nPhilosophy.\n\nAccording to Moore a proposition is composed out of concepts. If we\nare to be acquainted with propositions we have to take their elements,\ni.e., concepts, to have independent existence (because of assumption\na). Moore points out:\n\n\n\u2026 we have approached the nature of a proposition or judgment. A\nproposition is composed not of words, nor yet of thoughts, but of\nconcepts. Concepts are possible objects of thought; but that is no\ndefinition of them. It merely states that they may come into relation\nwith a thinker; and in order that they may do anything, they\nmust already be something. It is indifferent to their nature\nwhether anyone thinks them or not. They are incapable of change; and\nthe relation into which they enter with the knowing subject implies no\naction or reaction. It is a unique relation which can begin to cease\nwith a change in the subject; but the concept is neither cause nor\neffect of such a change. The occurrence of the relation has, no doubt,\nits causes and effects, but these are to be found only in the subject.\n(1899: para. 9)\n\n\nMoore is well aware that this analysis of the nature of a proposition\nleads to some version of what could be called \u201cconceptual\nrealism\u201d, according to which that what is \u201creally\u201d\nreal are concepts because they are the ultimate objects of\nacquaintance. He explicitly states:\n\n\nIt would seem, in fact, \u2026that a proposition is nothing other\nthan a complex concept. The difference between a concept and a\nproposition, in virtue of which the latter alone can be called true or\nfalse, would seem to lie merely in the simplicity of the former. A\nproposition is a synthesis of concepts; and, just as concepts are\nthemselves immutably what they are, so they stand in infinite\nrelations to one another equally immutable. A proposition is\nconstituted by any number of concepts, together with a specific\nrelation between them; and according to the nature of this relation\nthe proposition may be either true or false. What kind of relation\nmakes a proposition true, what false, cannot be further defined, but\nmust be immediately recognized (1899: para. 12)\n\n\nMoore also is very well aware that his view of the nature of concepts\ncommits him to the claim that the world insofar as it is an object\nof propositional knowledge consists of concepts because these are\nthe only things one can be acquainted with if acquaintance is a\ncondition of knowledge. Thus he writes:\n\n\nIt seems necessary, then, to regard the world as formed of concepts.\nThese are the only objects of knowledge. They cannot be regarded\nfundamentally as abstractions either from things or from ideas; since\nboth alike can, if anything is to be true of them, composed of nothing\nbut concepts. A thing becomes intelligible first when it is analyzed\ninto its constituent concepts. The material diversity of things, which\nis generally taken as starting-point, is only derived; and the\nidentity of the concept, in several different things, which appears on\nthat assumption as the problem of philosophy, will now, if it instead\nbe taken as the starting-point, render the derivation easy. Two things\nare then seen to be differentiated by the different relations in which\ntheir common concepts stand to other concepts. The opposition of\nconcepts to existents disappears, since an existent is seen to be\nnothing but a concept or complex of concepts standing in a unique\nrelation to the concept of existence. (1899: para. 16).\n\n\nMoore confesses that \u201cI am fully aware of how paradoxical this\ntheory must appear, and even how contemptible\u201d (1899: para. 14).\nAnd indeed one wonders whether such an account does not raise more\nproblems than it answers. Fortunately we do not have to be concerned\nwith this question here. However, if we ask whether Moore\u2019s\ntheory really manages to avoid idealism, it is hard not to conclude\nthat its metaphysical commitments are precisely a form of idealism,\neven if he has been led to his theory by an attempt to maintain\nepistemological realism! After all, to claim that only concepts are\nreal, that they have a mode of being outside of space and time, that\nthey are non-physical and completely unaffected by any activity of a\nthinking subject, does not sound very different from statements that\ncan rightly be attributed to, e.g., Hegel, or even ultimately Plato,\nand that are meant to assert idealism. The main difference in this\ncase is that Moore\u2019s conception of what a concept is has\nvirtually nothing to do with what Hegel means by\n\u201cconcept\u201d, but this does not suffice to establish\nontological anti-idealism. Although Moore might avoid identifying\nconcepts with the mental states of subjects by his insistence upon the\nmetaphysical independence of concepts, he comes dangerously close to\nthe point where the difference between ontological idealism and\nontological realism vanishes and this distinction becomes a question\nof terminology.\n\nRussell chooses a different path in the attempt to somehow reconcile\nthe idea that knowledge has to be understood as a relation of\nacquaintance with objects with the phenomenon of propositional\nknowledge. He is more flexible both with respect to kinds of knowledge\nand with respect to kinds of objects with which we can be acquainted\nthan Moore is. First of all, he distinguishes between knowledge of\nthings and knowledge of truths. He recognizes two kinds of knowledge\nof things: knowledge by acquaintance and knowledge by description.\nKnowledge by acquaintance obtains whenever\n\n\nwe have acquaintance with anything of which we are directly\naware, without the intermediary of any process of inference or any\nknowledge of truths. (1912 [1974: 46])\n\n\nKnowledge by (definite) description obtains\n\n\nwhen we know that it [i.e., the object] is \u201cthe\nso-and-so\u201d, i.e., when we know that there is one object, and no\nmore, having a certain property. (1912 [1974: 53])\n\n\nThe relation between these two kinds of knowledge is the\nfollowing:\n\n\n[K]nowledge concerning what is known by description is ultimately\nreducible to knowledge concerning what is known by acquaintance. (1912\n[1974: 58])\n\n\nKnowledge of truths is distinguished from these two kinds of\nknowledge of things. Knowledge of truths consists in pieces\nof knowledge that although they cannot be proven by experience are\nsuch that we nevertheless \u201csee\u201d their truth (1912 [1974:\n74]). Examples of truths that can be known this way are logical\nprinciples, the principle of induction, and everything we know a\npriori. This taxonomy of kinds of knowledge, Russell believes,\ncan account both for the possibility of non-propositional and\npropositional knowledge and at the same time retain the claim as to\nthe primacy of the acquaintance-relation for knowledge.\n\nThe obvious question now is: if all knowledge is ultimately based on\nacquaintance, what is it we can be acquainted with, i.e., what are the\nlegitimate objects of acquaintance? Because, according to Russell, the\nacquaintance relation is a relation to individual things this question\ntranslates into \u201cwhat are the individual things we can be\nacquainted with?\u201d Russell\u2019s answer to this question is\nthat there are exactly two kinds of things we can be acquainted with,\nnamely particulars, i.e., things that exist, and universals, i.e.,\nthings that subsist (cf. 1912 [1974: 100]). Particulars comprise\nsense-data, thoughts, feelings, desires and memories of \u201cthings\nwhich have been data either of the outer senses or of the inner\nsense\u201d (1912 [1974: 51]). Universals are\n\n\nopposed to the particular things that are given in sensation. We speak\nof whatever is given in sensation, or is of the same nature as things\ngiven in sensation, as a particular; by opposition to this, a\nuniversal will be anything which may be shared by many\nparticulars. (1912 [1974: 93])\n\n\nUniversals are conceptual entities: \u201cThese entities are such as\ncan be named by parts of speech which are not substantives; they are\nsuch entities as qualities or relations\u201d (1912 [1974: 90]).\nBecause universals and particulars alike are possible objects of\nacquaintance both have to be real. However, according to Russell they\nare real in a different sense. Particulars have existence in time\nwhereas universals have timeless being. The first ones exist, the\nother subsist. They form two different worlds in that the world of\nparticulars consists of items that are \u201cfleeting, vague, without\nsharp boundaries\u201d whereas the world of universals \u201cis\nunchangeable, rigid, exact\u201d (1912 [1974: 100]).\n\nThis rough outline of Russell\u2019s epistemic universe is meant to\nemphasize only those aspects of his position that are of relevance for\nan assessment of idealistic tendencies in his approach to knowledge.\nAs in the case of Moore it is tempting to interpret his commitment to\na timeless world of universals as pointing if not to an endorsement at\nleast to a toleration of a position that is difficult to distinguish\nfrom some version of an ontological idealism. But again one has to\nacknowledge that such a verdict is not very significant because one\ncould as well describe this position as a version of ontological\nrealism. It just depends on what is claimed to be the distinctive\nfeature of idealism. If idealism is a position characterized by taking\nfor granted the reality of conceptual entities that are not\nmind-dependent then both Moore and Russell endorse it. If idealism is\nmeant to be a position which takes conceptual items to be\nmind-dependent, that is, dependent on particular minds, then both are\nrealists with respect to concepts. However, it is hard to see how\nRussell can avoid the epistemological path to idealism given his views\nabout physical objects. This is so because of his sense-datum theory,\naccording to which what is immediately present to us, i.e., what we\nare acquainted with when we are acquainted with particulars, are just\nsense-data and not objects in the sense of individual things with\nqualities standing in relations to each other. For him \u201camong\nthe objects with which we are acquainted are not included physical\nobjects (as opposed to sense-data)\u201d (1912 [1974: 52]). Physical\nobjects are constructions we form out of sense-data together with some\ndescriptive devices, and only with respect to these constructions can\nwe have knowledge by description, i.e., propositional knowledge. If\nidealism is understood (as has been done here) as involving the claim\nthat what we take to be objects of knowledge are heavily dependent on\nsome activity of the knowing subject, then the very idea of an object\nas a construction guarantees the endorsement of idealism. Thus, in\ncontrast to their self-proclaimed revolt against the idealism of\nBerkeley and Bradley, the positions of both Moore and Russell are by\nno means free of traits that connect them rather closely to well known\ncurrents in modern idealism; and these features, above all the\nsupposition that knowers may be immediately presented with some sorts\nof informational atoms, whether properties, sense-data, or whatever,\nbut that all further knowledge, or all knowledge beyond immediate\nacquaintance, involves constructive activities of the mind, are common\nthroughout a great deal of recent philosophy.\n\nTo trace the subterranean presence of at least epistemological\nidealism throughout the remainder of twentieth-century philosophy\nwould exceed the brief for this entry. There is room here for just a\nfew hints of how such an account would go. At Oxford, some influence\nof idealism continued until World War II in the person of Robin George\nCollingwood, who was influenced by Hegel and the Italian philosopher\nBenedetto Croce but was a very original thinker. Collingwood\u2019s\nmost characteristic position might be his claim that metaphysics is\nthe study of the presuppositions of human knowledge, at various\nhistorical periods, rather than of independently existing entities;\nthus he might be considered as adopting a fundamental epistemological\npremise for idealism, although he does not seem to have drawn an\nontological conclusion from it\u2014perhaps as a practicing\narchaeologist as well as a philosopher, the physical world was just\ntoo real to him for that. In Germany, Neo-Kantianism, especially of\nthe Marburg school, from Hermann Cohen to Ernst Cassirer, thus from\nthe 1870s to the 1940s, stressed human conceptualization, in\nCassirer\u2019s case in the guise of \u201csymbolic forms\u201d,\nwhile trying to steer clear of traditional metaphysical questions;\ntheir position might thus also be considered a form of epistemological\nrather than ontological premise for but not outright acceptance of\nmetaphysical idealism. Neo-Kantianism in turn influenced the broader\nstream of analytic philosophy through the person of Rudolf Carnap,\nwhose Logical Construction of the World (1928) analyzes\nknowledge in terms of relations constructed on perceived similarities\nin qualities of objects, thus taking a subjectivist starting-point and\nthen adding constructive activities of the mind to it\u2014a form of\nepistemological idealism. Nelson Goodman\u2019s Structure of\nAppearance (1951) undertook a similar project. Subsequent to the\nLogical Construction, Carnap distinguished between questions\n\u201cinternal\u201d to a conceptual framework or system and\n\u201cexternal\u201d questions about which conceptual framework to\nadopt, which can be decided only on pragmatic or even aesthetic\ngrounds, and this too might be considered a form of epistemological\nidealism. Thomas Kuhn\u2019s famous conception of\n\u201cparadigms\u201d of science which are not automatically\nrejected because of refractory evidence but are given up only when an\nalternative paradigm comes to seem preferable can be seen as being in\nthe Carnapian tradition, as can Hilary Putnam\u2019s \u201cinternal\nrealism\u201d of the 1980s, and both these positions thus reflect\nsome of the motives for epistemological idealism. Even W.V. Quine, who\nwas a committed physicalist in the sense of believing that other\nsciences are in principle reducible to physics, nevertheless shared an\naspect of idealist epistemology in his conception of the \u201cweb of\nbelief\u201d, that is, the idea that knowledge consists in a body of\nbeliefs, from particular observation statements down to logical\nprinciples, which faces experience only as a whole and which can be\nmodified at any point within it in order to accommodate refractory\nexperience, as seems best. A similar idea was already to be found in\nCassirer\u2019s early work Substance and Function (1912),\nwhich points to the underlying impulse to epistemological idealism.\nWilfrid Sellars\u2019s conception of the \u201cspace of\nreasons\u201d, taken up in Robert Brandom\u2019s inferentialism,\nalso reflects this impulse, although Sellars always considered\nhimself, like his father, a scientific realist, and his most\nexplicitly Kantian work, Science and Metaphysics (1968),\ngives what might be regarded as a pragmatist rather than idealist spin\nto Kant\u2019s phenomena/noumena distinction, interpreting the\nnoumenal as what would be known if science were complete, an idea\nclearly inspired by Charles Sanders Peirce rather than by\nKant\u2014although not completely different in spirit from\nRoyce\u2019s idea that the error of our particular beliefs can be\nunderstood only by comparison to a body of complete and completely\ntrue beliefs, not to some independent, non-belief reality. These are\njust a few examples of how some of the most prominent paradigms, to\nborrow Kuhn\u2019s term, of analytic philosophy still reflect the\nimpulse to epistemological idealism even though the name\n\u201cidealism\u201d was anathematized by Moore, Russell, and the\nNew Realists.\n\nHowever, one mid-twentieth century philosopher who had no qualms about\nidentifying himself as an idealist was Brand Blanshard\n(1892\u20131987). The difference between Blanshard and many of the\nmid-twentieth century analytic philosophers is precisely that\nBlanshard accepted the assumption that there must be a necessary\nisomorphism between knowledge and its object, and so was not content\nto posit something real outside of the web of belief or space of\nreasons, but brought reality into the realm of thought. \n\nBlanshard was an undergraduate at the University of Michigan, then won\na Rhodes scholarship to Merton College, Oxford, where his tutor was\nH.W.B. Joseph and he also met Bradley, a lifelong research fellow at\nMerton. After earning an MA at Columbia, where he participated in a\nresearch project under John Dewey, and then World War I service in\nFrance, he completed his Oxford BA and then a PhD at Harvard under the\nsupervision of C.I. Lewis\u2014so he had a very diverse philosophical\neducation. He taught at Swarthmore College from 1925 to 1944 and at\nYale from 1944 until 1961. Remarkably, Blanshard was at different\npoints in this career in the same department as each of the\nSellarses\u2014he was an undergraduate at Michigan when Roy Wood\nSellars was a young teacher there, and was then Wilfrid\nSellars\u2019s colleague during the latter\u2019s tenure at Yale\nfrom 1958 to 1963. There are affinities between his views and theirs,\nespecially with Wilfrid Sellars\u2019s conception of\nconceptually-informed perception; but they differ decidedly on the\nissue of idealism vs. material realism. Blanshard\u2019s idealism was\nat full-strength in the two volumes of The Nature of Thought\n(1939), which was dedicated to the Oxford idealists H.H. Joachim and\nE.F. Carritt; many arguments remained the same but the inference to\nidealism was somewhat toned-down in his later trilogy, Reason and\nGoodness (1961), Reason and Analysis (1962), and\nReason and Belief (1974).\n\nThe affinity with Wilfrid Sellars lies in Book I of The Nature of\nThought, \u201cThought in Perception\u201d, in which Blanshard\nargues that we always perceive something \u201cas this rather than\nthat\u201d, thus that \u201cthe recognition of the universal and the\nplacing it in relation to other universals\u201d are always\ninseparable from perception (1939: volume I, p. 65). This recognition\nof the conceptually-infused character of perception, the position\nadopted by such Sellarsians as John McDowell (McDowell 1994) and\ncurrently known as \u201cconceptualism\u201d, does not by itself\nentail idealism. Rather, Blanshard\u2019s idealism is on display in\nVolume II, Book III of his work, \u201cThe Movement of\nReflection\u201d, where he offers his theory of truth. Here he argues\nthat coherence rather than correspondence is not only the\n\u201ctest\u201d but also the \u201cnature\u201d of truth: \n\n\nIt is hard to see \u2026 how anyone could consistently take\ncoherence as the test of truth unless he also took it as a character\nof reality. (1939: vol. II, p. 267) \n\n\nHere Blanshard evinces the premise that knowledge must be isomorphic\nwith the known that underlies many arguments for idealism. His next\nmove, the characterization of coherence as a character of reality in\nterms of systematicity, seems sufficiently abstract to remain neutral\nabout the ontology of reality. But he also argues that knowledge or\nthought must be part of a single system with its object, the\nworld, (1939: vol. II, p. 292), which, since knowledge is\nincontrovertibly mental, pushes the whole system in that direction.\nHis idealism becomes even clearer in his defense of the Bradleian\ndoctrine that all relations are internal relations, and as such\nnecessary relations, so that \n\n\nThese old sharp lines of mutual exclusion between essence, property,\nand accident are like the lines of a surveyor, of great convenience,\nno doubt, to ourselves, but misleading when taken as divisions marked\nout by nature. (1939: vol. II, p. 480) \n\n\nand when he further asserts \n\n\n(i) that all things are causally related, directly or\nindirectly; (ii) that being causally related involves being\nlogically related. (1939: vol. II, p. 492) \n\n\nThis makes sense if the character of reality is ultimately either\nconceptual or mental in nature, subject to logical relations, and not\npurely physical, subject merely to causal relations. Blanshard\u2019s\nstatement that the \u201cold sharp lines\u201d between essence and\naccident are not so sharp after all might sound like W.V.O.\nQuine\u2019s thesis that there is no sharp distinction between the\nanalytic and the synthetic (Quine 1951), but while this leads Quine to treat all our\nbeliefs as if they are synthetic, ultimately dependent upon our total\nresponse (the web of belief) to observation of external reality,\nBlanshard\u2019s position is more that all our beliefs are ultimately\nanalytic, that is, analyses of the conceptual structure of reality, or\nof reality as a conceptual structure. Blanshard concludes his lengthy\nargument with claims reminiscent of Hegel: \n\n\nThe aim of thought from its very beginning \u2026 was at\nunderstanding. The ideal of complete understanding would be achieved\nonly when this system that rendered it necessary was not a system that\nitself was fragmentary and contingent, but one that was all-inclusive\nand so organized internally that every part was linked to every other\nby intelligible necessity\u2026 . If our account of the end is\naccepted, it will be found to throw light backward alone the whole\ncourse of the inquiry. For it presents the goal which thought, from\nits first stirrings in perception, has more or less unknowingly been\nseeking, the end potential in every idea, the whole implicitly at work\nat every stage in the movement of reflection, exercising its steady\npressure against irrelevant excursions and toward the completion of\nfragmental knowledge into stable system. (1939: vol. II, p. 518) \n\n\nKnowledge must be knowledge of necessary connections, and reality\nitself must be an intrinsically intelligible system of connections or\ninternal relations. Blanshard\u2019s combination of the premise of\nthe necessary isomorphism of knowledge and the known with the doctrine\nof internal relations exemplifies both an epistemological and an\nontological argument for idealism.\n\nSince the work of Blanshard in the 1930s, very few Anglophone\nphilosophers have attempted an explicit defense of idealism. Both John\nFoster, in The Case for Idealism (1982) and Timothy Sprigge\nin The Vindication of Absolute Idealism (1983) constructed\ndefenses of what Foster defined by the three theses \n\n\n(1) Ultimate contingent reality is wholly mental. (2) Ultimate\ncontingent reality is wholly non-physical. (3) The physical world is\nthe logical product of facts about human sense-experience (Foster\n1982: 3) \n\n\nand what Sprigge called \u201cpanpsychism\u201d. In both cases their\ndefenses were based on the epistemological premise that the object of\nperception is fully present in the act of perception; Sprigge\nadded the argument that we must presuppose some noumenal ground for\nour phenomenal objects; but unlike Kant, who after he stripped things\nin themselves of their spatiality and/or temporality, insisted that we\nremain otherwise agnostic about their nature, Sprigge argued that \n\n\nthe noumenal backing or \u201cin itself\u201d of the physical by\nsaying that it consists in innumerable mutually interacting centres of\nexperience, or, what comes to the same, of pulses and flows of\nexperience. (Sprigge 1983: 85) \n\n\nIn other words, the noumenal \u201cbacking\u201d of the phenomenal\nis nothing but the sum total of actual and possible human experience,\nwhich Sprigge considers, in terms going back to Bradley, a\n\u201cconcrete universal\u201d. One could argue that this confused\nthe sum total of experience or thought about reality with reality\nitself, but Sprigge rejects that kind of distinction from the\nbeginning of his argument; basically, he holds all knowledge to be\nknowledge by acquaintance, and what we have when we subsume any\nexperience under a concept or universal is an immediate relation to\npart of a concrete universal\u2014so all of reality is itself mental\nin nature.\n\nThese arguments have remained outliers, for analytical philosophy has\nbeen overwhelmingly influenced by the paradigm of the natural\nsciences, and often committed to some form of naturalism. Or so it\nwould seem; however, as the examples of Green and Royce as well as\nearlier idealists such as Schelling make clear, there is no necessary\nincompatibility between idealism and some forms of naturalism. In\nparticular, naturalism, especially broadly understood as a methodology\nrather than ontology, is not automatically committed to the kinds of\nrealism, especially the na\u00efve realism of assuming that our\nrepresentations reproduce the physical constitution of external\nobjects, that were initially opposed to idealism. One might even get\nthe impression that in contemporary scientifically-oriented philosophy\nidealism is no longer considered a threat. The way in which in current\ndiscussions in the philosophy of mind some idealistic conceptions\nunder the general name of \u201cPanpsychism\u201d, already used by\nSprigge, are taken seriously (Thomas Nagel, David Chalmers) seems to\nbe a good indicator of this tendency.\n\nIn so-called \u201ccontinental\u201d philosophy, we might suggest,\nthe main alternative to the idealism of the nineteenth century and\nlingering tendencies to idealism in both Neo-Kantianism and Husserlian\nphenomenology has not been any straightforward form of realism, but\nrather the \u201clife philosophy\u201d (Lebensphilosophie)\npioneered by Wilhelm Dilthey (1833\u20131916), then extensively\ndeveloped by Martin Heidegger (1889\u20131976), and, without\nHeidegger\u2019s political baggage, by the French philosopher Maurice\nMerleau-Ponty (1908\u20131961). The central idea of this approach to\nphilosophy is that the starting-point of thought and knowledge is\nneither anything \u201csubjective\u201d like sense-data or ideas nor\nanything simply objective like the objects of science, but the lived\nexperience of \u201cbeing-in-the-world\u201d, from which both the\n\u201csubjective\u201d such as sense-data and the\n\u201cobjective\u201d such as objects theorized by science are\nabstractions or constructions made for specific purposes, but which\nshould not be reified in any way that creates a problem of getting\nfrom one side to the other, let alone any possibility of reducing one\nside to the other and thus ending up with a choice between idealism\nand realism. Apart from all issues of style, and whether this has been\nclear to the two parties or not, perhaps the deepest reason for the\non-going divide between \u201canalytical\u201d and\n\u201ccontinental\u201d philosophy is the on-going tension between\nthe impulse to epistemological idealism and the attraction of the idea\nthat \u201cbeing-in-the-world\u201d precedes the very distinction\nbetween subjective and objective. But then again, this underlying idea\nof the Heideggerian approach to philosophy may already be suggested in\nthe work of Schelling, so perhaps the fundamental debate within\ntwentieth-century philosophy has taken place within a framework itself\ninspired by a form of idealism, namely phenomenology. But this would\nbe a long story, for another day.\n\nAt the beginning of the twenty-first century, however, idealism,\nunderstood as a philosophical program, may be sharing the fate of many\nother projects in the history of modern philosophy. Originally\nconceived in the middle of the eighteenth century as a real\nalternative to materialistic and naturalistic perspectives, it may now\nbecome sublated and integrated into views about the nature of reality\nthat ignore metaphysical oppositions or epistemological questions\nconnected with the assumption of the priority of mind over matter or\nthe other way round. Instead the focus may be shifting to establishing\na \u201cneutral\u201d view according to which \u201canything\ngoes\u201d (Feyerabend) as long as it does not contradict or at least\nis not incompatible with our favored metaphysical, epistemological and\nscientific (both natural and social) methods and practices.\n",
