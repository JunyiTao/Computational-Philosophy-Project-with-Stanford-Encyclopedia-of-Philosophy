    "main_text": "\n\nHermeneutics is the study of interpretation. Hermeneutics plays a role\nin a number of disciplines whose subject matter demands interpretative\napproaches, characteristically, because the disciplinary subject\nmatter concerns the meaning of human intentions, beliefs, and actions,\nor the meaning of human experience as it is preserved in the arts and\nliterature, historical testimony, and other artifacts. Traditionally,\ndisciplines that rely on hermeneutics include theology, especially\nBiblical studies, jurisprudence, and medicine, as well as some of the\nhuman sciences, social sciences, and humanities. In such contexts,\nhermeneutics is sometimes described as an \u201cauxiliary\u201d\nstudy of the arts, methods, and foundations of research appropriate to\na respective disciplinary subject matter (Grondin 1994, 1). For\nexample, in theology, Biblical hermeneutics concerns the general\nprinciples for the proper interpretation of the Bible. More recently,\napplied hermeneutics has been further developed as a research method\nfor a number of disciplines (see, for example, Moules inter alia\n2015).\n\nWithin philosophy, however, hermeneutics typically signifies, first, a\ndisciplinary area and, second, the historical movement in which this\narea has been developed. As a disciplinary area, and on analogy with\nthe designations of other disciplinary areas (such as \u2018the\nphilosophy of mind\u2019 or \u2018the philosophy of art\u2019),\nhermeneutics might have been named \u2018the philosophy of\ninterpretation.\u2019 Hermeneutics thus treats interpretation itself\nas its subject matter and not as an auxiliary to the study of\nsomething else. Philosophically, hermeneutics therefore concerns the\nmeaning of interpretation\u2014its basic nature, scope and validity,\nas well as its place within and implications for human existence; and\nit treats interpretation in the context of fundamental philosophical\nquestions about being and knowing, language and history, art and\naesthetic experience, and practical life.\n",
