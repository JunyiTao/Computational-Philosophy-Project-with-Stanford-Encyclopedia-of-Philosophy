Should Everyone Receive Equal Voting Rights? || Democratic Challenges to One Person, One Vote\n6.1 Democratic Challenges to One Person, One Vote\n\nThe idea of \u201cOne person, one vote\u201d is supposedly grounded\non a commitment to egalitarianism. Some philosophers believe that\ndemocracy with equal voting rights is necessary to ensure that\ngovernment gives equal consideration to everyone\u2019s interests\n(Christiano 1996, 2008). However, it is not clear that giving every\ncitizen an equal right to vote reliably results in decisions that give\nequal consideration to everyone\u2019s interests. In many decisions,\nmany citizens have little to nothing at stake, while other citizens\nhave a great deal at stake. Thus, one alternative proposal is that\ncitizens\u2019 votes should be weighted by how much they have a stake\nin the decision. This preserves equality not by giving everyone an\nequal chance of being decisive in every decision, but by giving\neveryone\u2019s interests equal weight. Otherwise, in a system of one\nperson, one vote, issues that are deeply important to the few might\ncontinually lose out to issues of only minor interest to the many\n(Brighouse and Fleurbaey 2010).\n\nThere are a number of other independent arguments for this conclusion.\nPerhaps proportional voting enhances citizens\u2019 autonomy, by\ngiving them greater control over those issues in which they have\ngreater stakes, while few would regard it as significant loss of\nautonomy were they to have reduced control over issues that do not\nconcern them. Further, though the argument for this conclusion is too\ntechnical to cover here in depth (Brighouse and Fleurbaey 2010; List\n2013), it may be that apportioning political power according to\none\u2019s stake in the outcome can overcome some of the well-known\nparadoxes of democracy, such as the Condorcet Paradox (which show that\ndemocracies might have intransitive preferences, i.e., the majority\nmight prefer A to B, B to C, and yet also prefer C to A).\n\nHowever, even if this proposal seems plausible in theory, it is\nunclear how a democracy might reliably instantiate this in practice.\nBefore allowing a vote, a democratic polity would need to determine to\nwhat extent different citizens have a stake in the decision, and then\nsomehow weight their votes accordingly. In real life,\nspecial-interests groups and others would likely try to use vote\nweighting for their own ends. Citizens might regard unequal voting\nrights as evidence of corruption or electoral manipulation (Christiano\n2008: 34\u201345). \n",
