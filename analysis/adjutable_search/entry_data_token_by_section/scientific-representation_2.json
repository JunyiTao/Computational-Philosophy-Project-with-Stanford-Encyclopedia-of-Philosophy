    "main_text": "The Similarity Conception\n3. The Similarity Conception\n\nSimilarity and representation initially appear to be two closely\nrelated concepts, and invoking the former to ground the latter has a\nphilosophical lineage stretching back at least as far as Plato\u2019s\nThe\n Republic.[8]\n In its most basic guise the similarity conception of scientific\nrepresentation asserts that scientific models represent their targets\nin virtue of being similar to them. This conception has universal\naspirations in that it is taken to account for representation across a\nbroad range of different domains. Paintings, statues, and drawings are\nsaid to represent by being similar to their subjects, and Giere\nproclaimed that it covers scientific models alongside \u201cwords,\nequations, diagrams, graphs, photographs, and, increasingly,\ncomputer-generated images\u201d (2004: 243). So the similarity view\nrepudiates the demarcation problem and submits that the same\nmechanism, namely similarity, underpins different kinds of\nrepresentation in a broad variety of contexts.\n\nThe view offers an elegant account of surrogative reasoning.\nSimilarities between model and target can be exploited to carry over\ninsights gained in the model to the target. If the similarity between\n\\(M\\) and \\(T\\) is based on shared properties, then a property found\nin \\(M\\) would also have to be present in \\(T\\); and if the similarity\nholds between properties themselves, then \\(T\\) would have to\ninstantiate properties similar to \\(M\\).\n\nHowever, appeal to similarity in the context of representation leaves\nopen whether similarity is offered as an answer to the ER-Problem or\nthe Problem of Style, or whether it is meant to set Standards of\nAccuracy. Proponents of the similarity conception typically have\noffered little guidance on this issue. So we examine each option in\nturn and ask whether similarity offers a viable answer. We then turn\nto the question of how the similarity view deals with the Problem of\nOntology.\n",
