Important Characteristics of Thought Experiments\n\nTheorizing about thought experiments usually turns on the details or\nthe patterns of specific cases. Familiarity with a wide range of\nexamples is crucial for commentators, and the list is very long (see,\ne.g., Stuart et al. 2018, pp. 558\u2013560) We will provide a few\nhere. One of the most beautiful early instances (found in Lucretius,\nDe Rerum Natura 1.951\u2013987; see Bailey 1950, pp.\n58\u201359) attempts to show that space is infinite: if there is a\npurported boundary to the universe, we can toss a spear at it. If the\nspear flies through, it isn\u2019t a boundary after all; if the spear\nbounces back, then there must be something beyond the supposed edge of\nspace, a cosmic wall that stopped the spear, a wall that is itself in\nspace. Either way, there is no edge of the universe; thus, space must\nbe infinite.\n\nThis example nicely illustrates many of the most common features of\nwhat it means to engage in the conduct of thought experiments: we\nvisualize some situation that we have set up in the imagination; we\nlet it run or we carry out an operation; we see what happens; finally,\nwe draw a conclusion. The example also illustrates the fallibility of\nthought experiments. Since the time of Lucretius, we\u2019ve learned\nhow to conceptualize space so that it could be both finite and\nunbounded. Imagine a circle, which is a one-dimensional space. As we\nmove around, there is no edge, but it is nevertheless finite. The\nuniverse might be a three-dimensional version of this topology. It is,\ntherefore, true that we must try to be mindful of unexpected\nlimitations due to \u201cphysical scale effects\u201d (Klee 2008),\nor other such things, when imagining counterfactual scenarios.\n\n\n\nFigure 1. \u201cWelcome to the edge of\nthe Universe\u201d\n\n\nOften a real experiment that is meant to be the analogue of a thought\nexperiment is impossible to be carried out as such due to physical,\ntechnological, ethical, or financial limitations (see, e.g., Sorensen\n1992, pp. 200\u2013202); but physical unrealizability needn\u2019t\nbe a defining condition of thought experiments. Rather, the main point\nis that we seem able to get a grip on nature just by thinking, and\ntherein lies the great interest for philosophy. That was the position\nof Ernst Mach (see Mach, 1897 and 1905; for a most instructive\nassessments of his views see K\u00fchne 2006, pp. 165\u2013202, and\nSorensen 1992, pp. 51\u201375). Thought experiments are on a spectrum\nof different kinds of experiments. They allow us to tap into a great\nstore of \u201cinstinctive knowledge\u201d picked up from past\nexperience. We will get back to Mach\u2019s theory further down. His\naccount of thought experiments remains one of the major theories of\nhow thought experiments work. One of Mach\u2019s favourite examples\nis due to Simon Stevin (see Mach, 1883, pp. 48\u201358). When a chain\nis draped over a double frictionless plane, as in Fig. 2a, how will it\nmove? Add some links as in Fig. 2b. Now it is obvious. The initial\nsetup must have been in static equilibrium. Otherwise, we would have a\nperpetual motion machine; and according to our experience-based\n\u201cinstinctive knowledge,\u201d says Mach, this is impossible. We\ndo not have to perform the experiment in the real world, which we\ncould not do, anyway, since it would require a perfectly frictionless\nplane. Nevertheless the outcome seems compelling.\n\n\n\n\n(a)\n\n\n\n\n(b)\n\n\nFigure 2. \u201cHow will it\nmove?\u201d\n\n\nJudith Thomson provided one of the most striking and effective thought\nexperiments in the moral realm (see Thomson 1971). Her example is\naimed at a popular anti-abortion argument that goes something like\nthis: A fetus is an innocent person. All innocent persons have a right\nto life. Abortion results in the death of a fetus. Therefore, abortion\nis morally wrong. In her thought experiment, Thomson asks you to\nimagine a famous violinist falling into a coma. The society of music\nlovers determines from medical records that you and you alone can save\nthe violinist\u2019s life by being hooked up to him for nine months.\nThe music lovers break into your home while you are asleep and hook\nthe unconscious (and unknowing, hence innocent) violinist to you. You\nmay want to unhook him, but you are then faced with the following\nargument put forward by the music lovers: The violinist is an innocent\nperson. All innocent persons have a right to life. Unhooking him will\nresult in his death. Therefore, unhooking him is morally wrong.\nHowever, the argument, even though it has the same structure as the\nanti-abortion argument, does not seem convincing in this case. You\nwould be very generous to remain attached for nine months, but you are\nnot morally obligated to do so. The parallel with the abortion case is\nevident. Thomson\u2019s thought experiment is effective in\ndistinguishing two concepts that had previously been run together:\n\u201cright to life\u201d and \u201cright to what is needed to\nsustain life.\u201d The fetus and the violinist might each have the\nformer, but it is not evident that either has the latter. The upshot\nis that even if the fetus has a right to life (which Thomson does not\nbelieve but allows for the sake of the argument), it may still be\nmorally permissible to abort. Those opposed to Thomson\u2019s view\nhave two options. They can either dismiss her thought experiment as a\nuseless fiction. In fact, thought experiments as a method in ethics\nhave their critics (see, e.g., Dancy 1985). Alternatively, they can\nprovide a different version of the same scenario to challenge the\nconclusion. It is a very intriguing feature of thought experiments\nthat they can be \u201crethought\u201d (see Bokulich 2001). Real\nexperiments are frequently open to reinterpretation, too. In this\nrespect there does not seem to be a principled difference between the\ntwo classes of experiments.\n\nLike arguments, thought experiments can be criticized in different\nways. Perhaps the set up is faulty; perhaps the conclusions drawn from\nthe thought experiment are not justified. Similar criticisms can arise\nin real experiments. Counter thought experiments are perhaps another\nform of criticism. They do not target the premises or conclusions\ninvolved in a particular thought experiment but question the\nphenomenon, i.e. the non-propositional heart of an imagined scenario\n(see Brown 2007). For example, Daniel Dennett is convinced that Frank\nJackson\u2019s Mary thought experiment is poor evidence to oppose\nphysicalism in philosophy of mind. In Jackson\u2019s version, Mary,\nwho knows everything physics and the neurosciences can possibly know\nabout colours but grew up in a colourless environment (seeing only\nblack, white and grey things), allegedly learns something new when she\nsees a red tomato for the first time. Now she knows what it is like to\nexperience red. This is an argument for qualia as something over and\nabove the physical. Instead of a red tomato, Dennett, in his version\nof the thought experiment, presents Mary with a bright blue banana. In\nhis version of the story (which seems just as plausible as\nJackson\u2019s), Mary balks and says she is being tricked, since she\nknows that bananas are yellow, and this, says Mary, is a consequence\nof knowing everything physical about colour perception. Mary does not\nlearn anything new when she sees coloured objects for the first time,\nso there is no case against physicalism after all. Jackson\u2019s\ninitial thought experiment was very persuasive, but Dennett\u2019s\nseems equally so, thus, undermining Jackson\u2019s argument, although\nthere is greater resistence to the conclusion of the latter than the\nformer! Dennett complains a great deal about the ongoing\n\u201cMariology\u201d, as he calls the continuing acceptance of\nJackson\u2019s thought experiment as a poweful case against\nphysicalism.\n\nClearly, thought experiments are characterized by an intriguing\nplasticity, and this raises the interesting question of what it is\nthat preserves the identity of a thought experiment. Replacing a red\ntomato with a blue banana might still leave us with the same thought\nexperiment\u2013\u2013slightly revised. But, at what point do we get\na new thought experiment? This is not merely a question about\nconceptual vagueness. It helps to facilitate a discussion of the\nintuitively most plausible view about the cognitive efficacy of\nthought experiments, according to which this power depends on their\nbeing arguments, in a fairly strict sense of argument. John D. Norton\nholds such a view, which will be discussed below. In light of cases\nwhere the discussion of one and the same thought experiment played an\nimportant role in settling a dispute, the following problem arises:\nhow can one and the same thought experiment support opposing views\nabout a particular matter if the arguments that correspond to the\ndifferent versions of the thought experiment that were entertained by\nthe disputing parties are significantly different? The dilemma is: we\ncould say that if there is more than one argument then there is more\nthan one thought experiment involved in the dispute. But if that is\ntrue then the disputing parties simply talked past each other. One\nparty presented an argument that the other party ignored while\npresenting their own. Alternatively, we can say that one thought\nexperiment can correspond to many different arguments. But, if that is\ntrue then it becomes unclear in what non-trivial sense thought\nexperiments are supposed to be identical with arguments (see Bishop\n1999, and the response by Norton 2004, 63\u201364).\n\nThe plasticity of thought experiments coheres with another feature of\nthought experiments, namely that they seem to have \u201cevidential\nsignificance only historically and locally, i.e., when and where\npremises that attribute evidential significance to it [\u2026] are\nendorsed\u201d (McAllister 1996, p. 248).\n",
