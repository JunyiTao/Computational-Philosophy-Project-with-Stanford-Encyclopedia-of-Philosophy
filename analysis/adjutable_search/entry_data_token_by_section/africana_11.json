Africana Philosophy: Contributions\n\n\nSubstantial progress has thus been made in mitigating some of the\nimpediments that had long hampered recognition of and attending to the\nphilosophizing efforts of persons African and of African descent.\nNonetheless, still more mitigating work remains. There is the need, for\nexample, to bring to consideration for better appreciation the writings\nof several generations of especially thoughtful and insightful Black\nessayists and novelists, poets and musicians, artists and dancers,\npreachers and theologians, and other public-speaking Black\nintellectuals who, through their means of expression, have\nphilosophized about the conditions and prospects of Black folks and, in\nmany cases, have helped to sustain the will and determination to\nendure the assaults on the humanity, on the being, of\npersons and peoples African and of African descent. In this regard, too\nlittle attention has been given, for example, to the philosophical\nwriter-novelist Charles Johnson who, before he became a distinguished\nnovelist, was a graduate student in Philosophy. The articulated thought\nof many other Black writers, some of them novelists, also compel close,\nappreciative readings by philosophers for what these articulations\ndisclose of the writers coming to terms thoughtfully and creatively\nwith the exigencies of existence for Black folks as the writers\nimagined or re-imagined them in the locales and historical moments of\ntheir writerly creations. Likewise in many sermons, speeches, letters,\nsongs, and dances created and expressed, creatively very often, by\nthoughtful Black persons. Of necessity, then, Africana\nphilosophy must be an even more intensive and extensive\ninterdisciplinary enterprise.\n\n\nA principal impediment to the recognition and appreciation of the\nphilosophizings of Black folks have been the thorough investments in\nEurocentrism and White Racial Supremacy that have grounded and\nstructured so much of the historiography within the discipline of\nPhilosophy for so very many decades. Resolving these misconstruals of\nthe discipline\u2019s history will require substantial revisions,\nones inclusive of the philosophizings of persons of many excluded\ngroupings.  In so doing, careful work must be done to reclaim for\nwider distribution and careful study as many as possible of the\nearliest articulations\u2014many of which were never\npublished\u2014that helped pave the way to the development of African\nAmerican philosophy, of Africana philosophy more generally, as fields\nof discourse (Kuklick 2001; Kuklick 2008).\n\n\nWith hindsight, an especially crippling factor in the development of\nAfricana philosophy within academic Philosophy in the United States\n(throughout the African continent and the African Diaspora, in fact)\nhas been that far too little of the attention of the pioneers, and of\npresent practitioners, has been devoted to issues that are of\nsignificance to women African and of African descent even though, as\nhas been indicated through the narration of the history of\nphilosophizing born of struggles, the contributions of Black\nwomen have been significant though seldom with the prominence of\nattention they should have had outside of women\u2019s circles. As\nwas shown, in the New Worlds in which African peoples were being\nre-made/were remaking themselves into new persons and peoples of\nAfrican descent, numerous Black women across the generations were\nchallenged to think hard and long about the assaults on their\ncommunities, their families, their very bodies and souls. Here, then,\na compelling need to foster and support the philosophizing\nefforts of Black women who direct our attention to the lives and\nphilosophizing of Black women, historically and\ncontemporarily. Noteworthy in this regard are the groundbreaking,\ninspiring efforts of philosopher Kathryn Gines in founding the\nCollegium of Black Women Philosophers. The Collegium is bringing\ntogether women from across the country in conferences devoted to\nrecovering and recognizing the contributions of pioneering women\nphilosophers of African descent while exploring present issues and\nforging agendas of further work to be done.\n",
