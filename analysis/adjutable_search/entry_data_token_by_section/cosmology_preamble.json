    "main_text": "\n\nCosmology (the study of the physical universe) is a science that, due\nto both theoretical and observational developments, has made enormous\nstrides in the past 100 years. It began as a branch of theoretical\nphysics through Einstein\u2019s 1917 static model of the universe\n(Einstein 1917) and was developed in its early days particularly\nthrough the work of Lema\u00eetre\n (1927).[1]\n As recently as 1960, cosmology was widely regarded as a branch of\nphilosophy. It has transitioned to an extremely active area of\nmainstream physics and astronomy, particularly due to the application\nto the early universe of atomic and nuclear physics, on the one hand,\nand to a flood of data coming in from telescopes operating across the\nentire electromagnetic spectrum on the other. However, there are two\nmain issues that make the philosophy of cosmology unlike that of any\nother science. The first is,\n\nThe uniqueness of the Universe: there exists only one universe, so\nthere is nothing else similar to compare it with, and the idea of\n\u201cLaws of the universe\u201d hardly makes sense.\n\nThis means it is the historical science par excellence: it\ndeals with only one unique object that is the only member of its class\nthat exists physically; indeed there is no non-trivial class of such\nobjects (except in theoreticians\u2019 minds) precisely for this\nreason. This issue will recur throughout this discussion. The second\nis\n\nCosmology deals with the physical situation that is the context in the\nlarge for human existence: the universe has such a nature that our\nlife is possible.\n\nThis means that although it is a physical science, it is of particular\nimportance in terms of its implications for human life. This leads to\nimportant issues about the explanatory scope of cosmology, which we\nreturn to at the end.\n",
