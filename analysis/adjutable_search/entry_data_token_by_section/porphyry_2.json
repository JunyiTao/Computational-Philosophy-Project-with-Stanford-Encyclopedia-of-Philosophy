Philosophical Views\n\nIt seems safe to assume that before his encounter with Plotinus,\nPorphyry\u2019s philosophical views were shaped by Longinus, Numenius\nand other Middle Platonists, in addition to Plato, Aristotle and other\nclassics of Greek philosophy. After meeting with him he turned into a\nfollower of Plotinus, even if some of his Middle Platonist background\nshows through also in his post-Plotinian phase. This picture is\nstrongly suggested both by his Life of Plotinus and the\nSententiae, the only extant work in which he lays out his\nbasic philosophical views that is with certainty attributable to\nhim.\n\nFor Plotinus and Porphyry, there is a categorical gap between two\nrealms, the sensible and the intelligible. The latter realm contains\nthree \u201chypostases\u201d (three different ontological levels),\nthe One, Intellect and Soul. Of these, the One is the first cause of\neverything else; it is characterized by sheer unity which renders it\nbeyond thought and beyond description in language. Intellect is the\nsphere of real being, identified with the Platonic Forms, which are\nthe thoughts of a universal intellect. Soul, the lowest of the\nintelligible hypostases, is the intelligible item directly responsible\nfor the sensible realm. The sensible realm, which is an imperfect\nimage of the intelligible, also consists of levels: There are\norganisms, of which the sensible cosmos is one, comprising the other,\nlesser organisms. Organisms are ensouled beings and thus include an\nintelligible component. Below them on the scale are forms in matter,\nbodies, and matter itself. These too are results of Soul\u2019s\ncreative activity but are not intelligible entities.\n\nThe relationship between these levels is in general described in terms\nof a doctrine of double activity: each higher level has its\ncharacteristic internal activity which is accompanied by an external\npower or activity which constitutes the level below. This talk of\ninternal and external activities (powers) is equivalent to what is\nknown as the relationship between paradigms and imitations in\ntraditional Platonism.\n\nHuman beings have, so to speak, one leg in each realm: Through the\nbody and its non-rational soul (the seat of appetitive and spirited\ndesires and sense-perception) they belong to the sensible realm,\nthrough their higher soul (intellect) to the intelligible. Actually,\nthe true human being is to be identified with the intellect and the\nintelligible Man. It follows from this that the task set for human\nbeings is to free themselves from the sensible and live by the\nintelligible, which after all is their true or real nature.\n\nThis is Plotinus\u2019 philosophy, which Porphyry shares, in broad\noutline (see entry on\n Plotinus).\n There are, however, some differences in terminology, which show\nPorphyry to have a certain scholarly bent that Plotinus avoids, and\nPorphyry is in general more interested in reconciling Aristotle with\nPlatonism than Plotinus was. This is seen, for example, in\nPorphyry\u2019s more positive attitude towards the doctrine of\nAristotele\u2019s Categories. In what follows, we focus on\nsome points where Porphyry diverges from Plotinus or has been taken to\ndiverge from him, or may seem to develop his thought.\n",
