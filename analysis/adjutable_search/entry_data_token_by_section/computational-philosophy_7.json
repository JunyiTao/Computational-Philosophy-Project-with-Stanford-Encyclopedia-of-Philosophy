    "main_text": "Computational Philosophy by Example || From Theorem-Provers to Ethical Reasoning, Metaphysics, and Philosophy of Religion\n3.5 From Theorem-Provers to Ethical Reasoning, Metaphysics, and Philosophy of Religion\n\nMany of our examples of computational philosophy have been examples of\nsimulation\u2014often social simulation by way of agent-based\nmodeling. But there is also a strong tradition in which computation is\nused not in simulations but as a way of mechanizing and extending\nphilosophical argument (typically understood as deductive proof), with\napplications in philosophy of logic and ultimately in deontic logic,\nmetaphysics, and philosophy of\n religion.[10]\n\nEntitling a summer Dartmouth conference in 1956, the organizers coined\nthe term \u201cartificial intelligence\u201d. One of the high points\nof that conference was a computational program for the construction of\nlogical proofs, developed by Allen Newell and Herbert Simon at\nCarnegie Mellon and programmed by J. C. Shaw using the vacuum tubes of\nthe JOHNNIAC computer at the Institute for Advanced Study (Bringsjord\n& Govindarajulu 2018 [2019]). Newell and Simon\u2019s\n\u201cLogic Theorist\u201d was given 52 theorems from chapter two of\nWhitehead and Russell\u2019s Principia Mathematica (1910, 1912, 1913), of which it successfully\nproved 38, including a proof more elegant than one of Whitehead and\nRussell\u2019s own (MacKenzie 1995, Loveland 1984, Davis 1957\n[1983]). Russell himself was impressed:\n\n\nI am delighted to know that Principia Mathematica can now be\ndone by machinery\u2026 I am quite willing to believe that\neverything in deductive logic can be done by machinery. (letter to\nHerbert Simon, 2 November 1956; quoted in O\u2019Leary 1991: 52) \n\n\nDespite possible claims to anticipation, the most compelling of which\nmay be Martin Davis\u2019s 1950 computer implementation of Mojsesz\nPresburger\u2019s decision procedure for a fragment of arithmetic\n(Davis 1957), the Logic Theorist is standardly regarded as the first\nautomated theorem-prover. Newell and Simon\u2019s target, however,\nwas not so much a logic prover as a proof of concept for an\nintelligent or thinking machine. Having rejected geometrical proof as\ntoo reliant on diagrams, and chess as too hard, by Simon\u2019s own\naccount they turned to logic because Principia Mathematica\nhappened to be on his\n shelf.[11]\n\n\nSimon and Newell\u2019s primary target was not an optimized\ntheorem-prover but a \u201cthinking machine\u201d that in some way\nmatched human intelligence. They therefore relied in heuristics\nthought of as matching human strategies, an approach later ridiculed\nby Hao Wang:\n\n\nThere is no need to kill a chicken with a butcher\u2019s knife, yet\nthe net impression is that Newell-Shaw-Simon failed even to kill the\nchicken\u2026to argue the superiority of \u201cheuristic\u201d\nover algorithmic methods by choosing a particularly inefficient\nalgorithm seems hardly just. (Wang 1960: 3)\n\n\nLater theorem-provers were focused on proof itself rather than a model\nof human reasoning. By 1960 Hao Wang, Paul Gilmore, and Dag Prawitz\nhad developed computerized theorem-provers for the full first-order\npredicate calculus (Wang 1960, MacKenzie 1995). In the 1990s William\nMcCune developed Otter, a widely distributed and accessible prover for\nfirst-order logic (McCune & Wos 1997, Kalman 2001). A more recent\nincarnation is Prover9, coupled with search for models and\ncounter-examples in Mace4. Examples of Prover9 derivations are offered in Other Internet Resources. A contemporary alternative is Vampire, developed by Andrei Voronkov, Kry\u0161tof Hodere, and Alexander Rizanov (Riazanov & Voronkov 2002).\n\nTheorem-provers developed for higher-order logics, working from a\nvariety of approaches, include TPS (Andrews and Brown 2006), Leo-II\nand -III (Benzm\u00fcller, Sultana, Paulson, & Thei\u00df 2015;\nSteen & Benzm\u00fcller 2018), and perhaps most prominently HOL\nand particularly development-friendly\n Isabelle/HOL\n (Gordon & Melham 1993; Paulson 1990). With clever implementation\nand extension, these also allow automation of aspects of modal,\ndeontic, epistemic, intuitionistic and paraconsistent logics, of\ninterest both in their own terms and in application within computer\nscience, robotics, and artificial intelligence (McRobbie 1991; Abe,\nAkama, & Nakamatsu 2015).\n\nWithin pure logic, Portararo (2001 [2019]) lists a number of results\nthat have been established using automated theorem-provers. It was\nconjectured for 50 years that a particular equation in a Robbins\nalgebra could be replaced by a simpler one, for example. Even Tarski\nhad failed in the attempt at proof, but McCune produced an automated\nproof in 1997 (McCune 1997). Shortest and simplest axiomatizations for\nimplicational fragments of modal logics S4 and S5 had been studied for\nyears as open questions, with eventual results by automated reasoning\nin 2002 (Ernst, Fitelson, Harris, & Wos\n 2002).[12]\n\nTheorem provers have been applied within deontic logics in the attempt\nto mechanize ethical reasoning and decision-making (Meyer &\nWierenga 1994; Van Den Hoven & Lokhorst 2002; Balbiani, Broersen,\n& Brunel 2009; Governatori & Sartor 2010; Benzm\u00fcller,\nParent, & van der Torre 2018; Benzm\u00fcller, Farjami, &\nParent, 2018). Alan Gewirth has argued that agents contradict their\nstatus as agents if they don\u2019t accept a principle of generic\nconsistency\u2014respecting the agency-necessary rights of\nothers\u2014as a supreme principle of practical rationality (Gewirth\n1978; Beyleveld 1992, 2012). Fuenmayor and Benzm\u00fcller have shown\nthat even an ethical theory of this complexity can be formally encoded\nand assessed computationally (Fuenmayor & Benzm\u00fcller\n2018).\n\nOne of the major advances in computational philosophy has been the\napplication of theorem-provers to the analysis of classical\nphilosophical positions and arguments. From axioms of a metaphysical\nobject theory, Zalta and his collaborators use Prover9 and Mace to\nestablish theorems regarding possible worlds, such as the claim that\nevery possible world is maximal, modal theorems in Leibniz, and\nconsequences from Plato\u2019s theory of Forms (Fitelson & Zalta\n2007; Alama, Oppenheimer, & Zalta 2015; Kirchner, Benzm\u00fcller,\n& Zalta 2019).\n\nVersions of the ontological argument have formed an important thread\nin recent work employing theorem provers, both because of their\ninherent interest and the technical challenges they bring with them.\nProver9 and Mace have again been used recently by Jack Horner in order\nto analyze a version of the ontological argument in Spinoza\u2019s\nEthics (found invalid) and to propose an alternative (Horner\n2019). Significant work has been done on versions of Anselm\u2019s\nontological argument (Oppenheimer & Zalta 2011; Garbacz 2012;\nRushby 2018). Christoph Benzm\u00fcller and his colleagues have\napplied higher-order theorem provers, including including Isabelle/HOL\nand their own Leo-II and Leo-III, in order to analyze a version of the\nontological argument found in the papers of Kurt G\u00f6del\n(Benzm\u00fcller & Paelo 2016a, 2016b; Benzm\u00fcller, Weber,\n& Paleo 2017; Benzm\u00fcller & Fuenmayor 2018). A previously\nunnoticed inconsistency was found in G\u00f6del\u2019s original,\nthough avoided in Dana Scott\u2019s transcription. Theorem-provers\nconfirmed that G\u00f6del\u2019s argument forces modal\ncollapse\u2014all truths become necessary truths. Analysis with\ntheorem-provers makes it clear that variations proposed by C. Anthony\nAnderson and Melvin Fitting avoid that consequence, but in importantly\ndifferent ways (Benzm\u00fcller & Paleo 2014; Kirchner,\nBenzm\u00fcller, & Zalta\n 2019).[13]\n\nWork in metaphysics employing theorem-provers continues. Here of\nparticular note is Ed Zalta\u2019s ambitious and long-term attempt to\nground metaphysics quite generally in computationally instantiated\nobject theory (Fitelson & Zalta 2007; Zalta 2020).\n A link to Zalta\u2019s project can be found in the Other Internet Resources section below.\n\n",
