    "main_text": "Aesthetics, Epistemology and Metaphysics\n3. Aesthetics, Epistemology and Metaphysics\n\nEven a cursory glance through the writings of the romantics assures\nthe reader that their interest in art and aesthetics is closely tied\nto their epistemological and metaphysical concerns. The primacy that\nthe romantics attributed to aesthetics is explained by (but is not\nreduced to) the roles that art and beauty may play in the pursuits of\nepistemic and metaphysical goals. One such goal concerns what the\nGerman romantics, and following them, Coleridge, called the\n\u201cAbsolute\u201d [das Absolute].\n\nBriefly, this is how this explanation goes: in the aftermath of\nKant\u2019s philosophy, the romantics were concerned with the\nAbsolute, understood as the unconditioned totality of all conditions.\nLike Kant, they believed that such an unconditioned totality is\ninaccessible to discursive reason and is, to that extent,\nunknowable to human beings. But reason\u2019s natural drive towards\nthis \u201cAbsolute\u201d is nonetheless significant and valuable\n (\u00a73.1).\n In aesthetics they found a mode of life that best approximates (even\nif never reaches or grasps) the Absolute, insofar as the aesthetic\napproach to artworks (a) includes indeterminate affective aspect\n (\u00a73.2),\n (b) involves a sui generis normativity, constituting its own\nnorms in attunement with the artwork it faces\n (\u00a73.3),\n (c) is particularly suited to approach individual unities\n (\u00a73.4),\n and (d) is open-ended\n (\u00a73.5).\n",
