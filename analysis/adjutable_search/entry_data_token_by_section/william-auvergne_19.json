    "main_text": "The Soul || The Powers Characteristic of the Human Soul\n8. William\u2019s Influence\n\nScholars have devoted little attention to William\u2019s influence on\nlater writers. Nevertheless, it is clear that he gave rise to no\nschool of thought, and subsequent thinkers seem to have picked and\nchosen from his works the parts they would accept and the parts they\nwould reject. Thus, William\u2019s arguments that the world must have\na beginning probably influenced thinkers such as Bonaventure and Henry\nof Ghent, while his rejection of universal hylomorphism and his\nmetaphysics of being and essence may have influenced Aquinas, who\npresents similar views. There is also little doubt that some of\nWilliam\u2019s views were the subject of criticism, as for example\nhis apparent denial of genuine secondary causation (see Reilly 1953).\nThe large body of manuscripts in which William\u2019s works survive\nsuggests he was being read throughout the middle ages; Ottman 2005,\nfor example, lists 44 manuscripts known to contain On the\nUniverse. William\u2019s works were also published in a number\nof printed editions in the 16th and 17th\ncenturies.\n",
