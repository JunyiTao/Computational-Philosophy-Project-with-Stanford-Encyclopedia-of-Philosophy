The Puzzle of Political Authority: Philosophical Anarchism\n\n\nAt the root of all contemporary discussions of the legitimacy of\nauthority is the problem posed by Robert Paul Wolff concerning the\nincompatibility of moral autonomy and political authority. The problem\nis really only connected with the kinds of political authority that\nimply content independent duties to comply with authoritative commands.\nThe basic idea is that it is incompatible for a subject to comply with\nthe commands of an authority merely because it is the command of the\nauthority and for the subject to be acting morally autonomously. Wolff\nthinks that each person has a duty to act on the basis of his own moral\nassessment of right and wrong and has the duty to reflect on what is\nright and wrong in each particular instance of action. Such a person\nwould be violating his duty to act autonomously if he complies with\nauthoritative commands on grounds that are independent of the content\nof the commands. So the duty of autonomy is incompatible with the duty\nof obeying political authority. This is the challenge of philosophical\nanarchism (Wolff 1970).\n\n\nThe worry is that authority is never legitimate because the kind of\nobedience associated with authority is inconsistent with the autonomy\nof the subject. We can see, however, that this worry applies only to\ncertain accounts of authority, which imply duties to obey on the part\nof the subjects. The account of authority as justified coercion is not\naffected by this argument nor is the account of legitimate authority\nconsisting of a justification right affected by this worry. Still, most\naccounts of the nature of authority do imply content independent duties\non the part of the subjects. We can see that any content independent\nduty, whether it is a duty not to interfere with the authority's\ncommand or it is a duty to obey the authority, is called into question\nby this argument.\n",
