    "main_text": "\n\nPhilosophical skepticism is interesting because there are intriguing\narguments for it despite its initial implausibility. Many contemporary\nepistemological positions can be fruitfully presented as responding to\nsome aspect of those arguments. For example, questions regarding\nprinciples of epistemic closure and transmission are closely related\nto the discussion of what we will call Cartesian Skepticism, as are\nviews according to which we are entitled to dismiss skeptical\nhypotheses even though we do not have evidence against them. The\ntraditional issue of the structure of knowledge and justification,\nengendering Foundationalism, Coherentism, and Infinitism, can be seen\nas resulting from one main argument for what we will call Pyrrhonian\nSkepticism. In what follows we present these two forms of skepticism\nand assess the main arguments for them.\n",
