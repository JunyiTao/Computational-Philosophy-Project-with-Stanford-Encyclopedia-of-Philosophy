    "main_text": "Eight Ways of Dealing with the Repugnant Conclusion || Rejecting transitivity\n2.5 Rejecting transitivity\n\nWhat makes the Repugnant Conclusion so perplexing is that strong\narguments can be given which apparently force one into accepting the\nconclusion. In fact, several arguments to this effect\u2014with\naffinity to the mere addition reasoning outlined above\u2014have been\npresented (see e.g. Parfit 1986; Arrhenius 2000b; Kitcher 2000;\nT\u00e4nnsj\u00f6 2002; Rachels 2004). Roughly, the arguments share\nthe following structure: in comparison between three population\nscenarios the second scenario is considered better than the first and\nthe third better than the second, leading to the conclusion that the\nthird scenario is better than the first. By iterated application of\nthis line of reasoning one ends up with the Repugnant Conclusion (that\nZ is better than A). One of the more radical approaches\nto such arguments has been to reject the transitivity of the relation\n\u201cbetter than\u201d (or \u201cequally as good as\u201d).\nAccording to transitivity, if p is better than q,\nand q is better than r, then p is better\nthan r. However, if transitivity of \u201cbetter than\u201d\nis denied then the reasoning leading the Repugnant Conclusion is\nblocked (Temkin 1987, 2012; Persson 2004; Rachels 2004).\n\nOne of the questions raised by this radical proposal is whether\narguments like the mere addition paradox themselves justify the\nrejection of transitivity or whether further arguments are needed\nsince transitivity seems to be part of the meaning and logic of the\nrelation \u201cbetter than\u201d (Broome 2004). However, it has been\nsuggested that there are two \u201cbetter than\u201d-concepts, one\nbased on intrinsic value and one based on the stance that one ought to\ntake towards the evaluated objects (Arrhenius 2004; Rabinowicz 2012).\nThe former is transitive in virtue of its meaning whereas the latter\nis non-transitive over different alternative sets, just like\n\u201cought to be chosen\u201d. Moreover, Temkin (2012) argues that\nit is the latter \u201cbetter than\u201d-concept which is the\nimportant one for practical reasoning. This raises the question of the\nmore general implications of this proposal for morality and practical\nreasoning and some worry that giving up the transitivity of\n\u201cbetter than\u201d would demand a major revision of our notion\nof practical reasoning (Temkin 1987, 2012). A transitive preference\nordering has usually been assumed as part of the definition of a\nrational agent in economic and rational choice theory. For example, it\nseems that an agent with a non-transitive preference ordering can be\nexploited by a so-called \u2018money-pump\u2019 (see Section 5.1 of\nthe entry on the\n philosophy of economics).\n The main problem with non-transitive value orderings in moral theory,\nhowever, is that such an ordering cannot form the basis of a\nsatisfactory answer to the question of what one ought to choose.\nCoupled with the standard formulation of consequentialism (an action\nis right if and only if its outcome is at least as good as the\noutcomes of all the alternative actions, see the entry on\n consequentialism),\n for example, we get the counterintuitive result that no action is\nright in the mere addition paradox. Moreover, it has been shown that\nthe mere addition argument and the like can be reconstructed on the\nnormative level, in terms of what one ought to choose, without an\nappeal to transitivity (Arrhenius 2004). Instead of an non-transitive\nordering of populations, one gets a situation in which all of the\navailable actions are forbidden, i.e., a moral dilemma. Hence, it\ndoesn\u2019t look like we can exorcise the paradoxes of population\nethics by giving up some formal condition like the transitivity of\n\u201cbetter than\u201d.\n",
