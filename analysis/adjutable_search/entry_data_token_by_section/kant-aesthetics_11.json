    "main_text": "Teleology\n3. Teleology\n\nWhile Kant\u2019s ethical theory makes frequent reference to the ends\nor purposes adopted by human beings, the \u201cCritique of\nTeleological Judgment\u201d is concerned with the idea of ends or\npurposes in nature. (For the terms \u201cend\u201d and\n\u201cpurpose\u201d as translations of the German Zweck,\nsee footnote 2.) Among the most striking elements of Kant\u2019s\naccount of natural teleology are (i) his claim, in the \u201cAnalytic\nof Teleological Judgment\u201d, that organisms must be regarded by\nhuman beings in teleological terms, i.e., as \u201cnatural\npurposes\u201d, and (ii) his attempt, in the \u201cDialectic of\nTeleological Judgment\u201d, to reconcile this teleological\nconception of organisms with a mechanistic account of nature. These\nare described here in\n Section 3.3\n and\n Section 3.4,\n respectively. Prior to this,\n Section 3.1\n outlines Kant\u2019s notions of purpose and purposiveness in general\nand\n Section 3.2\n sketches nature\u2019s \u201cpurposiveness for our cognitive\nfaculties\u201d, i.e., its amenability to empirical scientific\nenquiry. The discussion of biological teleology and its relation to\nmechanism in Sections 3.3 and 3.4 is followed by two sections dealing\nwith further aspects of Kant\u2019s teleology:\n Section 3.5\n deals with Kant\u2019s view that nature as a whole may be regarded\nas a system of purposes, and\n Section 3.6\n with the implications of this teleological view of nature for\nmorality and religion.\n Section 3.7\n returns to Kant\u2019s biological teleology, considering briefly its\nimplications for contemporary biological thought.\n",
