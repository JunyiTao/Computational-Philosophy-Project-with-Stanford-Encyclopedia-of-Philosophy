Computer science impact\n\nWhen intuitionistic logic was first proposed early in the last\ncentury, it was presented as a challenge to the way traditional\nmathematicians were supposed to do business. Uses of the excluded\nmiddle and of proof-by-contradiction were considered suspect and\nproblematic, particularly in the presence of infinity. As\nintuitionistic logic concerns were developed into constructive\nmathematics, new constructive approaches have arisen to topics such as\ntopology, algebra, and analysis. Given that linear logic encompasses\nthe dynamics of proof (algorithm) and resources, its primary impact\nhas been not in traditional mathematics but in computer science.\nBefore overviewing the nature of that impact, we outline the various\nways in which logic more generally is used in computer science.\n\nLogic plays different roles in the specification of computations. We\ncan identify the following broad different approaches and note which\nroles have felt influences from linear logic.\n\nIn the computation-as-model approach, computations are\nencoded as mathematical structures and consist of such items as nodes,\ntransitions, and states. Logic is used externally to make\nstatements about those structures. That is, computations are\nused as models for logical expressions. Intensional operators, such as\nthe modals of temporal and dynamic logics or the triples of Hoare\nlogic, are often employed to express propositions about the change in\nstate. This use of logic to represent and reason about computation is\nprobably the most broadly successful use of logic for\nrepresenting computation. This role for logic has felt little\ninfluence from linear logic.\n\nIn the computation-as-deduction approach, pieces of\nlogic\u2019s syntax (such as formulas, terms, types, and proofs) are\nused directly as elements of the specified computation. In this more\nrarefied setting, there are two rather different approaches to how\ncomputation is modeled, called the proof normalization\napproach and the proof search approach.\n\nWe outline below the significant impacts that linear logic has had on\nboth of these different settings.\n",
