    "main_text": "Twentieth Century Classical Realism\n2. Twentieth Century Classical Realism\n\nTwentieth-century realism was born in response to the idealist\nperspective that dominated international relations scholarship in the\naftermath of the First World War. The idealists of the 1920s and 1930s\n(also called liberal internationalists or utopians) had the goal of\nbuilding peace in order to prevent another world conflict. They saw\nthe solution to inter-state problems as being the creation of a\nrespected system of international law, backed by international\norganizations. This interwar idealism resulted in the founding of the\nLeague of Nations in 1920 and in the Kellogg-Briand Pact of 1928\noutlawing war and providing for the peaceful settlements of disputes.\nU.S. President Woodrow Wilson, scholars such as Norman Angell, Alfred\nZimmern, and Raymond B. Fosdick, and other prominent idealists of the\nera, gave their intellectual support to the League of Nations. Instead\nof focusing on what some might see as the inevitability of conflict\nbetween states and peoples, they chose to emphasize the common\ninterests that could unite humanity, and attempted to appeal to\nrationality and morality. For them, war did not originate in an\negoistic human nature, but rather in imperfect social conditions and\npolitical arrangements, which could be improved. Yet their ideas were\nalready being criticized in the early 1930s by Reinhold Niebuhr and\nwithin a few years by E. H. Carr. The League of Nations, which the\nUnited States never joined, and from which Japan and Germany withdrew,\ncould not prevent the outbreak of the Second World War. This fact,\nperhaps more than any theoretical argument, contributed to the\ndevelopment of the realist theory. Although the United Nations,\nfounded in 1945, can still be regarded as a product of idealist\npolitical thinking, the discipline of international relations was\nprofoundly influenced in the initial years of the post-war period by\nthe works of \u201cclassical\u201d realists such as John H. Herz,\nHans Morgenthau, George Kennan, and Raymond Aron. Then, during the\n1950s and 1960s, classical realism came under challenge of scholars\nwho tried to introduce a more scientific approach to the study of\ninternational politics. During the 1980s it gave way to another trend\nin international relations theory\u2014neorealism.\n\nSince it is impossible within the scope of this article to introduce\nall of the thinkers who contributed to the development of\ntwentieth-century classical realism, E. H. Carr and Hans Morgenthau,\nas perhaps the most influential among them, have been selected for\ndiscussion here.\n",
