    "main_text": "Epistemology and Academic Skepticism || Probabilism\n2.2 Probabilism\n\nThe contribution for which Carneades is best known, however, came in\nreply to the Stoics\u2019 counter-argument in defense of the\ncognitive impression. In response to their contention that, without\ncognitive impressions, human beings would lack any basis for action or\ninquiry Carneades argued that such a basis could be found in so-called\nprobable impressions (from probabilis, that which lends\nitself to or invites approval, Cicero\u2019s Latin for Greek\n\u201cpithanos,\u201d persuasive) (see Allen, 1994; Obdrzalek, 2006;\nReinhardt, 2018). The theory of probable impressions went far beyond\nanything Arcesilaus had said and had an independent appeal which\nArcesilaus\u2019 response to the same challenge lacked.\nCarneades\u2019 defense of this theory is a main reason why he was\nthought to have departed from or moderated the stricter skepticism\nthought to have been espoused by Arcesilaus and the Middle Academy\n(S.E. Pyrrhoneae hypotyposes [henceforward PH]\n1.227\u201330; M 7.166\u201389 = L&S 69DE). It seemed\nto be complemented by the line he sometimes defended on opinion, and\nthat some of his successors took for his considered opinion, according\nto which assent to non-cognitive impressions and the opinions to which\nit gives rise are compatible with wisdom (Acad. 2.59, 67,\n78). But the interpretation of Carneades championed by Clitomachus,\naccording to which the wise will refrain from assent and so avoid\nopinion, also relied on probability as the basis for an alternative\nform of approval (Acad. 2.99-100, 104-3).\n\nCarneades\u2019 defense of probabilism can also be viewed, at least\nin the first instance, as a natural extension of the Academy\u2019s\ntradition of dialectical argument, however. The epistemological debate\nbetween the Stoa and the Academy extended over many years and was\nconducted with a great deal of energy and ingenuity on both sides. It\ntended toward impasse. If the burden of argument fell entirely upon\nthe Academy and the its members were restricted to premises that were\nstrictly implied by Stoic theory, the Academic case was not proven.\nThe Stoics were not required on pain of self-contradiction to accept\nall the premises the Academics needed. Nonetheless, by rejecting these\npremises, the Stoics often committed themselves to highly disputable\ncontentions. This mattered to them, because their aim was not simply\nto vindicate the internal consistency of their system. They claimed\nthat their views were true and uniquely consistent with common\nconceptions held by all human beings.\n\nIn effect, the Stoics claimed that no position apart from theirs could\ndo justice to a set of considerations that were not peculiar to their\nschool but were accepted by everyone. It should, then, be possible for\nthem to convince open-minded and intelligent auditors of the truth of\nStoicism. The challenge that Carneades accepted was to show that there\nwere alternatives which could do justice to the agreed upon\nconsiderations as well as or better than did the Stoic position, while\ndispensing with its most distinctive and contentious features. Though\nit does not restrict itself to premises that are already Stoic\ndoctrines, this form of argument is broadly dialectical. By aiming to\ndo justice to the considerations which the Stoics agree are relevant\nto the area in question, and directing his arguments to intelligent\nand open-minded auditors whom they are committed to taking seriously,\nCarneades, perhaps among other things, was trying to show the Stoics\nthat their position did not satisfy the standards they set for\nthemselves. Because the theories he put forward and defended to this\nend are not based solely on Stoic doctrines, they sometimes have a\nwider appeal, and it is easier to attribute them to their author.\nNonetheless, though they are Carneades\u2019 in the sense of being\nhis creations, they need not have expressed his convictions.\n\nIn keeping with this style of argument, Carneades prepared the way for\nhis theory of probability by setting out an epistemological framework\nwhich, though obviously indebted to Stoic views, was intended to\ncapture intuitions that were more widely shared. In this broadly\nfoundationalist framework it is natural to look for a criterion of\ntruth where the Stoics and other Hellenistic philosophers do, viz.\namong self-evident impressions of sense (S.E. M\n7.159\u201365 = L&S 70A). Yet the Academy\u2019s arguments\nagainst cognitive impressions seem to have shown that no such\nimpressions are to be found. With the aid of his account of\nprobability, Carneades undertook to show that, after all, they are not\nneeded. Rational action and inquiry are possible without the\nfoundation that cognitive impressions promised to provide because\nprobable impressions can serve in their place. And if this is right,\nor if it is sufficiently plausible, the Stoics\u2019 attempt to\nprovide indirect support for their contentions about the cognitive\nimpression by showing that there are no satisfactory alternatives will\nfail.\n\nThe account of probability explains how one can discriminate among\nimpressions by investigating whether an initially persuasive\nimpression agrees with one\u2019s other impressions or if there is\nsomething about the conditions in which it arose that undermines\nconfidence in it. The more such checks it survives, the more\nconfidence one will have in it. Depending on the amount of time\navailable and the importance of the matter in question, it is possible\nto perform more or fewer of them. Although no amount of checking is\nsufficient to eliminate any chance of error, it is possible to achieve\nthe degrees of confidence required in different circumstances to make\nrational action and theoretical inquiry possible (Acad. 2.32,\n110). Carneades\u2019 theory is thus an early instance of\nfallibilism. And he seems to have used it not only to counter the\nStoics\u2019 argument that there are no alternatives to their theory,\nbut also to suggest that that theory\u2019s reliance on self-evident\nperceptual impressions is misplaced, even when viewed as an\nepistemological ideal. According to Carneades\u2019 theory, the\nimprovement of which our faculties are capable is not a matter of\napproaching the condition of perfect discrimination of self-evident\nimpressions ever more closely; it consists instead in refining\none\u2019s appreciation for the complicated relations between\nimpressions in virtue of which they add to or detract from each\nother\u2019s value as evidence, which in some cases may lead us to\nreject apparently self-evident, true impressions.\n\nDrawing on his account of probable impressions, Carneades defended two\nviews about assent. He sometimes argued that the wise person will\nalways withhold assent, but will be able to act and inquire by\nfollowing or using probable impressions in a way that does not amount\nto assent, and so does not involve holding opinions about anything\n(Acad. 2.59, 99, 108). On other occasions, he maintained that\nthe wise person will assent to what is probable and so form opinions,\nbut with the proviso that he may be wrong (Acad. 2.59, 67,\n78, 112). In this way he gave his interlocutors a choice between two\nalternatives to Stoic orthodoxy, each of which describes a way of life\nwithout the certainty furnished by cognitive impressions. Either one\nlives entirely without opinions, while following probable impressions\nwithout assenting to them or one lives with opinions, but opinions\nthat are held in a self-consciously tentative spirit and subject to\nrevision in the light of new evidence.\n\nThe view according to which the wise person assents and forms opinions\nappealed to those convinced by the Academy\u2019s arguments that,\nthough certainty is unobtainable, well founded probabilities are\nwithin our grasp, among which is this view itself. Someone who thinks\nthis is likely to see little point in keeping a special kind of\napproval, assent, in reserve for a kind of certainty which he thinks\nis neither needed nor possible, though he cannot be certain of this\nany more than he can be certain of anything else. This view was, it\nseems, favored by Philo of Larissa among others (cf. Brittain, 2001),\nand it gave rise to a form of probabilism, as a positively endorsed\ntheory of knowledge, which is one of the New Academy\u2019s legacies.\nThe other view, which favors withholding assent while still relying on\nprobability, appealed to those who were attracted, as Zeno and\nArcesilaus had been, to the ideal of certain knowledge, for which it\npreserves assent while permitting a weaker form of approval. This is\nthe classical skeptical stance that was the New Academy\u2019s other\nlegacy, which was defended by Clitomachus, and it also influenced the\nother main ancient school of skepticism, the Pyrrhonists. It is\nnoteworthy that the more radical forms of skepticism defended by\nClitomachus and the Pyrhonists were less firmly attached to the\nskeptical proposition that nothing can be known than moderate\nskeptics, who assented vehemently to it (Acad. 2. 148).\n",
