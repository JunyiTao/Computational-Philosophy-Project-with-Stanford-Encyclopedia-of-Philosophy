Definitional Characteristics of Default Interpretations\n\nIt is evident from the sample of approaches presented above that the\nnotion of default meaning is used slightly differently in each of\nthem. We can extract the following differences in the understanding of\ndefault interpretations:\n\n[1a] Defaults belong to competence.\n\nvs.\n\n[1b] Defaults belong to performance.\n\n[2a] Defaults are context-independent.\n\nvs.\n\n[2b] Defaults can make use of contextual information.\n\n[3a] Defaults are easily defeasible.\n\nvs.\n\n[3b] Defaults are not normally defeasible.\n\n[4a] Defaults are a result of subdoxastic, automatic process.\n\nvs.\n\n[4b] Defaults can involve conscious pragmatic inference.\n\n[5a] Defaults are developments of the logical form of the uttered\nsentence.\n\nvs.\n\n[5b] Defaults need not enrich the logical form of the sentence but may\noverride it (which is orthogonal to the question as to whether\ndefaults have to be literal meanings)\n\n[6a] Defaults can all be classified as one type of pragmatic process.\n\nvs.\n\n[6b] Defaults come from qualitatively different sources in utterance\nprocessing.\n\nThere is also disagreement concerning the following properties, to be\ndiscussed below:\n\n[7a] Defaults are always based on a complete proposition.\n\nvs.\n\n[7b] Defaults can be \u2018local\u2019,\n\u2018sub-propositional\u2019, based on a word or a phrase.\n\n[8a] Defaults necessarily arise more quickly than non-default\nmeanings. Hence they can be tested for experimentally by measuring the\ntime of processing of the utterance.\n\nvs.\n\n[8b] Defaults do not necessarily arise more quickly than non-default\nmeanings because both types of meaning can be based on conscious,\neffortful inference. Hence, the existence of defaults cannot be tested\nexperimentally by measuring the time of processing of the\nutterance.\n\nThe \u2018whose meaning\u2019 question also give rise to\ncontroversies, such as those discussed in Section 4:\n\n[9a] Default meanings are static: they are intended, or recovered, or\n(normally) both.\n\nvs.\n\n[9b] Default meanings are dynamic, interactional, and as such are the\nresult of the joint construction of meaning in conversation.\n\nQuestions on the boundary of linguistics and ethics, linguistics and\nepistemology, or linguistics and law (to name a few) also give rise to\nrival positions, such as:\n\n[10a] Speakers are accountable only for the minimal semantic content\nof their utterances.\n\nvs.\n\n[10b] Speakers are accountable for standard, default (in one of the\nabove senses) interpretations or their utterances.\n\nThis may lead to more specific controversies, such as:\n\n[10a\u2032] What counts as a lie or an insult pertains to default (in\none of the above senses) content.\n\nvs.\n\n[10b\u2032] What counts as a lie or an insult pertains to minimal\nsemantic content.\n\nThese are addressed in Section 5.\n\n[1]\u2013[8] are the most standardly accepted characteristics of\ndefault interpretations in theoretical semantics and pragmatics. We\nshall not include here definitional characteristics of defaults in\ncomputational linguistics as these are a subject for a separate study.\nSome of the properties in [1]\u2013[8] are interrelated, some of the\nothers just tend to occur together. Levinson\u2019s presumptive\nmeanings, for example, are defeasible, i.e., fulfil [3a], local [7b],\npertain to competence [1a], and are faster to process than inferential\nmeanings [8a]. They are competence defaults of the type [1a] because\nthey arise independently of the situation of discourse and are\ntriggered by the construction alone, due to the presumed default\nscenario that it pertains to. For example, scalar inference from\n\u2018many\u2019 to \u2018not all\u2019 is a case of a\ncompetence-based, context-independent, local default. Similarly, the\nrhetorical structure rules of SDRT give rise to competence defaults.\n(15b) is a result of the common, shared knowledge that pushing\nnormally results in falling.\n\n(15a)You pushed me and I fell.\n(15b)You pushed me and as a result I fell.\n\nAs regards feature 7, it is at least conceivable that presumed\nmeanings arise as soon as the triggering word or construction has been\nprocessed by the hearer. For Levinson (1995, 2000), salient meanings\nhave this property of arising even before the processing of the\nsentence is completed but can subsequently be cancelled if further\ncontext witnesses against them.. In other words, they arise\npre-propositionally or locally. Discourse\ninterpretation proceeds incrementally and similarly the assignment of\ndefault meanings to the processed segments is incremental. For\nexample, the scalar term many in (16a) triggers the presumed\nmeaning not all as soon as it has been processed. The\nsubscript d in (16b) stands for the default meaning and is\nplaced immediately after the triggering construction.\n\n(16a)Many people liked Peter Carey\u2019s new novel.\n(16b)Many (d many but not all) people liked Peter\n    Carey\u2019s new novel.\n\nSimilarly, \u2018paper cup\u2019 and \u2018tea cup\u2019 give rise\nto presumed meanings locally, as in (17b) and (18b) respectively.\n\n(17a)Those paper cups are not suitable for hot drinks.\n(17b)Those paper cups (d cups made of paper) are not\n    suitable for hot drinks.\n(18a)I want three tea cups, three saucers and three spoons please.\n(18b)I want three tea cups (d cups used for drinking tea),\n    three saucers and three spoons please.\n\nInferences such as those in (17b) and (18b) are very common. They are,\nhowever, substantially different from the inference in (16b) in that\nthe resulting meaning is the lexical meaning of the collocation,\nsimilar to that of a compound. Other examples include \u2018pocket\nknife\u2019 vs. e.g., \u2018bread knife\u2019, and \u2018coffee\nspoon\u2019 vs. e.g., \u2018silver spoon\u2019. It is worth\nremembering that on Levinson\u2019s account, presumed, salient\ninterpretations can be explained through the principles of rational\ncommunicative behaviour summed up as his Q, I and M heuristics (see\nSection 1.2 and Levinson 1995, 2000). (16b) arises through the\nQ-heuristic, \u2018What isn\u2019t said isn\u2019t\u2019, while\n(17b) and (18b) arise through the I-heuristic, \u2018What is\nexpressed simply is stereotypically exemplified\u2019. Most\ngenerally, the defaults that arise through the Q-heuristic exploit a\ncomparison with what was not, but might have been, said. For example,\n\u2018most\u2019 triggers an inference to a denial of a stronger\nitem \u2018all\u2019; \u2018believe\u2019 triggers an inference to\n\u2018not know\u2019. At the same time, they are all easily\ncancellable, as (16c) illustrates.\n\n(16c)Many, and possibly all, people liked Peter Carey\u2019s new\n    novel.\n\nI-heuristic exploits only what there is in the sentence: it is an\ninference to a stereotype and as such is not so easily cancellable.\nFor example, (19) and (20) seem rather bizarre.\n\n(19)Those paper cups, I mean cups used for storing paper, are full.\n(20)I want three tea cups, I mean cups used for storing tea\n    leaves.\n\nPerhaps the fact that these defaults are not so easily cancellable\ncomes from their property of resembling lexical compounds and, like in\nthe case of compounds, the link between the juxtaposed lexemes is very\nstrong in their case. If indeed it is plausible to treat them on a par\nwith compounds, then they are not very useful as a supporting argument\nfor local defaults: instead of defaults, we have lexical meaning of\ncompounds.\n\nLocal defaults allow us to dispose of the level of an underspecified\npropositional representation in semantic theory. Since the inferences\nproceed incrementally, then as soon as the triggering expression is\nencountered, there is no level of a minimal proposition that would\nconstitute a foundation for further inferences. If there is one, it is\njust accidental, in that the triggering item may just happen to be\nplaced at the end of the sentence, for example \u2018tea cups\u2019\nin the first clause of (20) above. But it is also important to note\nthat the status of such defaults is still far from clear. For example,\nLevinson\u2019s defaults are local, but at the same time\n\u2018cancellable\u2019 to the extent that the context may prevent\nthem from arising. This leads to a difficulty in examples such as\n(21)\u2013(22).\n\n(21)You are allowed five attempts to get the prize.\n(22)You are allowed to do five minutes of piano practice today\n    because it is late.\n\nIt is clear that in (21) \u2018five\u2019 is to be understood as\n\u2018at most five\u2019. How are we to model the process of\nutterance interpretation for this case? Are we to propose that the\ninference from \u2018at least five\u2019 to \u2018exactly\nfive\u2019 takes place and is then cancelled? Or are we to propose\nthat \u2018five\u2019 is by default \u2018at least five\u2019 (or\nunderdetermined five, or \u2018exactly five\u2019, depending on the\norientation (see Horn 1992; Koenig 1993; Bultinck 2005) and becomes\naltered in the process of pragmatic inference to \u2018at most\nfive\u2019 in the context of \u2018allow\u2019? But then,\n\u2018allow\u2019 is also present in (22) and the inference to\n\u2018at most\u2019 is not at all salient: doing a longer piano\npractice is generally preferred but may not be what the addressee\nlikes doing and \u2018five\u2019 may end up, in this context, to\nmean \u2018as little as five\u2019 or \u2018five or more\u2019,\nstressing that more than five is not expected but allowed. In (23),\nthe problem is even more salient. If \u2018five\u2019 triggers\nlocally the \u2018exactly\u2019 meaning, then the default has to be\ncancelled immediately afterwards when \u2018are needed\u2019 has\nbeen processed and the \u2018at least\u2019 interpretation becomes\nobvious.\n\n(23)Five votes are needed to pass the proposal.\n\nAlternatively, we can stipulate that the first inference takes place\nafter the word \u2018needed\u2019. It is clear that a lot needs to\nbe done to clarify the notion of local defaults: most importantly, (i)\nwhat counts as the triggering unit, (ii) to what extent context is\nconsulted, and (iii) how common cancellation is. But it seems that if\ndefaults prove to be so local as to arise out of words or even\nmorphemes, then they are part of the computational power of grammar\nand they belong to grammar and lexicon rather than to semantics and\npragmatics. Chierchia (2004) and Landman (2000) represent this view.\nChierchia argues that since scalar implicatures do not arise in\ndownward-entailing contexts (contexts that license inference from a\nset to its subset), there is a clear syntactic constraint on their\nbehaviour (but see Chemla et al. 2011). Jaszczolt (2012)\ncalls such units that give rise to defaults or inferential\nmodification \u2018fluid characters\u2019, employing Kaplan\u2019s\n(1989) content-character distinction, to emphasise the fact that the\nunit of meaning that leads to inference or to a default meaning varies\nfrom context to context and from speaker to speaker: characters are\n\u2018fluid\u2019 because they correspond to \u2018flexible\ninferential bases\u2019 or \u2018flexible default bases\u2019. But\nmuch more theorizing and substantial empirical support are needed to\nestablish the exact size of such local domains and the corresponding\nfluid characters.\n\nAs far as feature [8] is concerned, experimental work helps decide\nbetween [8a] and [8b], measuring the recovery time for the default\nmeaning as opposed to the non-default one. The development of the\nability to use scalar inferences has also been tested (Noveck 2001,\n2018; Papafragou & Musolino 2003; Musolino 2004; Noveck and\nSperber 2004; Geurts 2010; see also contributions to Cummins and\nKatsos 2019 ). It has been argued on the basis of some evidence that\ndefault interpretations are not faster to produce and can be absent\naltogether from processing in the case of five-year old subjects.\nNoveck (2004) provides the following evidence against Levinson\u2019s\nautomatic and fast defaults. Children were presented with some\ndescriptions of situations in which the order of the events was\ninverted in narration. They had to assess whether the description was\ntrue or false. The outcome was that the children who agreed with the\ninverted description reacted faster than the ones who disagreed. It\nwas then concluded that enriching \u2018and\u2019 to \u2018and\nthen\u2019 is not automatic: it takes time. And, if pragmatically\nenriched responses take longer, then they cannot be the default ones\n(see Noveck 2004: 314). Similarly, with scalar terms, if one could\ndemonstrate that the enriched readings, such as \u2018some but not\nall\u2019 for \u2018some\u2019, arise faster than \u2018some but\nnot necessarily not all\u2019, one would have strong evidence in\nsupport of the defaults view.\n\nThe problem is that all these experiments assume Levinson\u2019s\nnotion of a fast and inference-free default while this is, as we have\nseen, by no means the only understanding of default interpretations,\nand, arguably, not even the most commonly assumed one. The\nexperimenters talk of arguments for and against \u2018the Default\nView\u2019, \u2018the Default Model\u2019 (see also Bezuidenhout\nand Morris 2004, Breheny et al 2006), while, in fact there is no such\nunique model to be falsified: there are very different understandings\nof defaultness even in post-Gricean pragmatics alone, as is evident\nfrom Section 1. The list of possible defining characteristics of\ndefault interpretations in [1]\u2013[8] shows that one cannot talk\nabout the default meaning. At the same time, it is much\nharder to provide any experimental evidence for or against salient\nmeaning that draw on some contextual information, arise late in\nutterance processing, and are not normally cancellable. The latter\nalso seem much more intuitively plausible than Levinson\u2019s rigid\ndefaults in that they are simply shortcuts through costly pragmatic\ninference and as such can be triggered by the situation itself rather\nthan by the properties of a lexical item or construction at large.\nThey are just normal, unmarked meanings for the context at hand and it\nis not improbable that such default, salient interpretations will\nprove to constitute just the polar end of a scale of degrees of\ninference rather than have qualitatively different properties from\nnon-default, clearly inference-based interpretations. They will occupy\nthe area towards the \u2018zero\u2019 end of the scale of inference\nbut will not trigger the dichotomy \u2018default vs. inferential\ninterpretation\u2019. But since it is debatable whether salience\nought to be equated with defaultness in he first place, our\nterminological quandary comes back with full strength (see Section\n3).\n\nIt is also difficult to pinpoint the boundary between default and\nnon-default interpretations when we allow context and inference to\nplay a role in default meanings, that is when we allow [2b] and [8b].\nThis does not mean, however, that we should pour them out with the\nbath water and resort to proposing nonce-inference in the case of\nevery single utterance produced in discourse. When context-dependence\nof defaults is allowed, then the main criterion for such meanings is\ntheir subdoxastic arrival. When conscious inference is allowed, then\nthe main criterion is the fact that only minimal contextual input is\nallowed, such as, say, the co-text in (24). In (24), the definite\ndescription \u2018the first daughter\u2019 has the attributive\nrather than referential reading.\n\n(24)The first daughter to be born to Mr and Mrs Brown will be called\n    Scarlett.\n\nOn a traditional Gricean view of post-propositional, sentence-based\npragmatic inference, we have here the default attributive reading: the\nexpression \u2018to be born\u2019 and the future auxiliary\n\u2018will\u2019 signal that no particular, extant, known individual\nis referred to. This is also the view followed in Default Semantics\n(Section 1.8) where both inference and defaults are \u2018assumed to\nbe global\u2019 \u2013 \u2018assumed\u2019 in the sense of a\nmethodological assumption put in place until we have the means to test\nthe actual length of fluid characters and the content of the\ncorresponding default bases. In other words, information arrived at\nthrough WS merges with that from CPI, CD and SCWD when all of\nthe WS is ready. But in Default Semantics there is no default involved\nin (24): we have WS merging with CPI to produce the attributive\nreading. On Levinson\u2019s presumptive meanings account (Section\n1.3), it can be stipulated that (24) would fall in-between GCIs and\nPCIs: the only context that is required is the sentence itself, so the\nexample is not different from any other cases of GCIs. But the\nlocality of the GCI is the problem: depending on how we construct the\nlength of the triggering expression, we obtain a GCI or a PCI. When we\nconstrue it as \u2018the first daughter\u2019, the sub-part of the\ndefinite noun phrase, then we obtain the referential reading as the\ndefault, to be cancelled by \u2018to be born\u2019. In short, we\ndon\u2019t know yet, at the current state of theorizing and\nexperimenting, which of the potential defining characteristics of\ndefaults to employ. Neither are we ready to propose the demarcation\nline between default and non-default interpretations. We can conceive\nof the first as shortcuts through inference but such a definition will\nnot suffice for delimiting a category. We can, however, concede that\ndefault interpretations are governed by principles of rational\nbehaviour in communication, be it Gricean maxims, neo-Gricean\nprinciples or heuristics, the logic of information structuring of\nSDRT, or a version of defeasible logic as presented above.\n\nAll in all, it appears that the diversity of default interpretations\npertains not only to their features listed in [1]\u2013[8] but also\nto their provenance. This diversified use makes the term heavily\ntheory-dependent. Next, we can move to orthogonal, albeit not less\nimportant, discussions of defaults vs. salience and defaults vs.\nliteral meaning.\n",
