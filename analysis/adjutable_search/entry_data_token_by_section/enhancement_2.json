What are the Proper Limits of Health Care?\nWhile much of the enhancement ethics literature leans towards\nthought experiments set in the future, it is grounded in a set of\nimportant debates about how health care should be defined today.\nIn these debates, the claim is often made that the distinction between\nusing biomedical tools to combat human disease and attempting to use\nthem to enhance human traits can provide practical guidance on a range\nof issues, including the limits of health professionals\u2019\nobligations (Miller, Brody and Chung 2000), the scope of health care\npayment plans (Daniels and Sabin 1994), and the prioritization of\nbiomedical research protocols (Mehlman, Berg, Juengst and Kodish 2011).\nIn each of these cases, the line between treatment and enhancement is\ndrawn to mark an upper boundary of professional and social obligations.\nJust as the concept of futile treatment is used to indicate the limits\nof a doctor\u2019s obligations when further intervention no longer can\nachieve therapeutic goals, enhancement interventions are thought to\nfall outside health care\u2019s proper domain of practice by going\n\u201cbeyond therapy\u201d in pursuit of other non-medical goals.\nThis means that patients have no role-related right to demand such\nservices from health professionals, fair insurance coverage plans may exclude\nthem, and those who do provide them bear a burden of justification for\ndoing so that does not apply to \u201cmedically necessary\u201d\ninterventions.\nAs a biomedical boundary marker, the distinction between treatment\nand enhancement has been enshrined in policies at both professional and\ngovernmental levels, and continues to inform much of the public\ndiscussion of new biomedical advances. However, this distinction is\nexplicated in several different ways, which have different merits as\nboundary markers for biomedical research and practice. In fact, with\nphilosophical scrutiny, the distinction often seems in danger of\ncollapsing entirely under conceptual critiques even before the question\nof its moral merits is entertained.\nWhen it is used as a medical boundary concept, enhancement, like\nfutility, plays both descriptive and normative roles. To use these\nconcepts, we need to be able to identify our efforts as either futile\nor enhancing and we need to know what the boundary means for going\nfurther. Part of the practical challenge for policy-makers\nis that for enhancement interventions, these descriptive and normative\nimplications seem to be at cross-purposes. While futile treatments do\nno good, enhancements are by definition and description\nimprovements in personal welfare. Yet, the boundary function\nof calling them \u201cenhancements\u201d in health policy settings is\nto place them outside of sanctioned interventions. For a field\ndedicated to pursuing improved welfare for its patients, the fact that\nenhancements often look just like all the other improvements that\nhealth care strives to achieve makes it difficult to discern when an\nintervention transgresses the normative boundary that the concept\npurports to mark.\nThis has provoked three major ways of operationalizing the\nenhancement concept, each of which seeks to redress the weaknesses of\nits predecessor, which are covered in the next three subsections.\n",
