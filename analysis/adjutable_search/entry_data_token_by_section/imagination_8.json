    "main_text": "Imagination in Cognitive Architecture || Imagination and Memory\n2.4 Imagination and Memory\n\nTo remember, roughly, is to represent\nsomething that is no longer the case. On the standard taxonomy, there\nare three types of memory. Nondeclarative memory involves mental\ncontent that is not consciously accessible, such as one\u2019s memory\nof how to ride a bike. Semantic declarative memory involves mental\ncontent that are propositional and not first-personal, such as\none\u2019s memory that Taipei is the capital of Taiwan. Episodic\ndeclarative memory involves mental content about one\u2019s own past,\nsuch as one\u2019s memory of the birth of one\u2019s child. (See\nthe entry on\n memory\n for a detailed discussion of this taxonomy, and especially the\ncriterion of episodicity.) In situating imagination in cognitive\narchitecture, philosophers have typically focused on similarities and\ndifferences between imagination and episodic declarative memory.\n\nThere are obvious similarities between imagination and memory: both\ntypically involve imagery, both typically concern what is not\npresently the case, and both frequently involve perspectival\nrepresentations. Thomas Hobbes (Leviathan: 2.3) claims that\n\u201cimagination and memory are but one thing, which for diverse\nconsideration has diverse names\u201d. In making this bold statement,\nHobbes represents an extreme version of continuism, a view on which\nimagination and memory refer to the same psychological mechanisms.\n\nThe orthodoxy on imagination and memory in the history of philosophy,\nhowever, is discontinuism, a view on which there are significant\ndifferences between imagination and memory, even if there are overlaps\nin their psychological mechanisms. Some philosophers find the\ndistinction in internalist factors, such as the\nphenomenological difference between imagining and\nremembering. Most famously, David Hume sought to distinguish the two\nin terms of vivacity\u2014\u201cthe ideas of the memory are\nmuch more lively and strong than those of the imagination\u201d\n(Treatise of Human Nature: 1.3; but see Kind 2017). Others\nwho have adopted a phenomenological criterion include Ren\u00e9\nDescartes, Bertrand Russell, and William James (De Brigard 2017).\nOther philosophers find the distinction in externalist factors, such\nas the causal connection that exists between memories and the\npast that is absent with imagination. Aristotle uses the causal\nconnection criterion to distinguish between imagination and memory\n(De Anima 451a2; 451a8\u201312; see De Brigard 2017).\nIndeed, nowadays the idea that a causal connection is essential to\nremembering is accepted as \u201cphilosophical common sense\u201d\n(see the entry on\n memory;\n but see also De Brigard 2014 on memory traces). As such, it is\nunsurprising that discontinuism remains the orthodoxy. As J. O. Urmson\n(1967: 83) boldly claims, \u201cOne of these universally admitted\ndistinctions is that between memory and imagination\u201d.\n\nIn recent years, two sets of findings from cognitive science has given\nphilosophers reasons to push back against discontinuism.\n\nThe first set of findings concern distortions and confabulations. The\ntraditional conception of memory is that it functions as an archive:\npast experiences are encapsulated and stored in the archive, and\nremembering is just passively retrieving the encapsulated mental\ncontent from the archive (Robins 2016). Behavioral psychology has\nfound numerous effects that challenge the empirical adequacy of the\narchival conception of memory. Perhaps the most well-known is the\nmisinformation effect, which occurs when a subject incorporates\ninaccurate information into their memory of an event\u2014even\ninaccurate information that they received after the event (Loftus 1979\n[1996]).\n\nThe second set of findings concern the psychological underpinnings of\n\u201cmental time travel\u201d, or the similarities between\nremembering the past and imagining the future, which is also known as\nmental time travel (see Schacter et al. 2012 for a review). Using\nfMRI, neuroscientists have found a striking overlap in the brain\nactivities for remembering the past and imagining the future, which\nsuggest that the two psychological processes utilize the same neural\nnetwork (see, for example, Addis et al. 2007; Buckner & Carroll\n2007; Gilbert & Wilson 2007; Schacter et al. 2007; Suddendorf\n& Corballis 1997, 2007). The neuroscientific research is preceded\nby and corroborated by works from developmental psychology (Atance\n& O\u2019Neill 2011) and on neurodivergent individuals: for\nexample, the severely amnesic patient KC exhibits deficits with\nremembering the past and imagining the future (Tulving 1985), and also\nexhibits deficits with the generation of non-personal fictional\nnarratives (Rosenbaum et al. 2009). Note that, despite the evocative\ncontrast between \u201cremembering the past\u201d and\n\u201cimagining the future\u201d, it is questionable whether\ntemporality is the central contrast. Indeed, some philosophers and\npsychologists contend that temporality is orthogonal to the comparison\nbetween imagination and memory (De Brigard & Gessell 2016;\nSchacter et al. 2012).\n\nThese two set of findings have given rise to an alternative conception\nthat sees memory as essentially constructive, in which remembering is\nactively generating mental content that more or less represent the\npast. The constructive conception of memory is in a better position to\nexplain why memories can contain distortions and confabulations (but\nsee Robins 2016 for complications), and why remembering makes use of\nthe same neural networks as imagining.\n\nIn turn, this constructive turn in the psychology and philosophy of\nmemory has revived philosophers\u2019 interest in continuism\nconcerning imagination and memory. Kourken Michaelian (2016)\nexplicitly rejects the causal connection criterion and defends a\ntheory on which remembering, like imagining, centrally involves\nsimulation. Karen Shanton and Alvin Goldman (2010) characterizes\nremembering as mindreading one\u2019s past self. Felipe De Brigard\n(2014) characterizes remembering as a special instance of hypothetical\nthinking. Robert Hopkins (2018) characterizes remembering as a kind of\nimagining that is controlled by the past. However, the philosophical\ninterpretation of empirical research remain contested; in dissent,\nDorothea Debus (2014, 2016) considers the same sets of findings but\nultimately concludes that remembering and imagining remain distinct\nmental kinds.\n",
