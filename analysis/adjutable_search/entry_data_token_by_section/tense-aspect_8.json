    "main_text": "Event Calculus || The Yale Shooting Scenario\n7.1 The Yale Shooting Scenario\n\nSuppose we have three kinds of actions/events\u2014Load,\nSmoke and Shoot\u2014and three time dependent\nproperties, the fluents Alive, Loaded and\n Dead.[6]\n Besides actions and fluents we will also need instants of time in our\nbasic ontology. The predicates listed in Table 4 are used to express\nactions and their effects and to locate them in time. \n\n\n\nFormula\nMeaning\n\nInitiates\\((\\alpha , \\beta , \\tau)\\)\nFluent \\(\\beta\\) starts to hold after action \\(\\alpha\\) at time\n\\(\\tau\\) \n\nTerminates\\((\\alpha , \\beta , \\tau)\\)\nFluent \\(\\beta\\) ceases to hold after action \\(\\alpha\\) at time\n\\(\\tau\\) \n\nInitially\\((\\beta)\\)\nFluent \\(\\beta\\) holds from time 0  \n\n\\(\\tau_1 \\lt \\tau_2\\)\nTime instant \\(\\tau_1\\) is before time instant\n\\(\\tau_2\\)  \n\nHappens\\((\\alpha , \\tau)\\)\nAction \\(\\alpha\\) happens at time \\(\\tau\\)  \n\nHoldsAt\\((\\beta , \\tau)\\)\nFluent \\(\\beta\\) holds at time \\(\\tau\\)  \n\nClipped\\((\\tau_1,\\beta ,\\tau_2)\\)\nFluent \\(\\beta\\) is terminated between times \\(\\tau_1\\) and\n\\(\\tau_2\\)  \n\nTable 4.\nPredicates of the simple event calculus (from Shanahan 1999)\n\n\nThe predicates are related to each other by a set of four simple\naxioms (34)\u2013(37). In these axioms, all variables are assumed to be universally\nquantified with maximal scope. We will come to the semantics of the\nimplication when we have introduced the complete scenario. \n34.\n\n \\(Initially(f) \\rightarrow HoldsAt(f, 0)\\)\n    35.\n\n \\(Initially(f) \\wedge \\neg Clipped(0, f, t) \\rightarrow HoldsAt(f, t)\\)\n    36.\n\n \\(Happens(a, t_1) \\wedge Initiates(a, f, t_1) \\wedge t_1 \\lt t_2\\ \\wedge\\)\n \\(\\neg Clipped(t_1, f, t_2) \\rightarrow HoldsAt(f, t_2)\\)\n    37.\n\n \\(Happens(a, t) \\wedge t_1 \\lt t \\lt t_2 \\wedge Terminates(a, f, t) \\rightarrow\\)\n \\(Clipped(t_1, f, t_2)\\)\n    \n\n The first three axioms state the conditions\nunder which a fluent can hold at a time \\(t\\): either it holds\nright from the start or it is initiated at a time \\(t_1\\)\nbefore \\(t\\) without a terminating action occurring in between the\ntwo. The fourth axiom defines the predicate Clipped\\((t_1,\nf,\nt_2)\\) saying that a fluent \\(f\\) is clipped\nbetween times \\(t_1\\) and \\(t_2\\) if it is\nterminated by some action \\(a\\) happening between\n\\(t_1\\) and \\(t_2\\). Simplifying a whole\nlot, the axioms (30)\u2013(33) formalize the notion of instantaneous\nchange, such as two balls colliding or somebody dying. Moreover, they\nembody a notion of inertia: fluents continue to hold unless\nterminated.\n\n\n\n\nNext, we have to translate the discourse (33) into the Simple Event\nCalculus. The first set of formulas (38)\u2013(40) states what the\nmentioned actions do. These formulas provide a crude sketch of the\nlexical meaning of load, smoke and shoot.\nThe effect of a Load action is to make the fluent\nLoaded hold, a Shoot action makes Dead hold\n(and Alive not hold) with Loaded being a\nprecondition. Finally, Smoke is assumed to have no effects\n(thus, there are no rules involving Smoke). \n38.\n\n\\(Initiates(Load, Loaded, t)\\)\n    39.\n\n\\(HoldsAt(Loaded, t) \\rightarrow Initiates(Shoot, Dead, t)\\)\n    40.\n\n\n\\(HoldsAt(Loaded, t) \\rightarrow Terminates(Shoot, Alive, t)\\)\n    \n\n(33) comprises a Load action followed by a Smoke\naction followed by a Shoot action. Using four arbitrarily\nchosen time points \\(T_1\\)\u2013\\(T_4\\) the\ndiscourse can be represented as follows: \n41.\n\n\\(Initially(Alive)\\)\n    42.\n\n\\(Happens(Load, T_1)\\)\n    43.\n\n\n\\(Happens(Smoke, T_2)\\)\n    44.\n\n\\(Happens(Shoot, T_3)\\)\n    45.\n\n\\(T_1 \\lt T_2 \\lt T_3 \\lt T_4\\)\n    \n\n\nFrom this little theory we want to derive\nHoldsAt(Dead, \\(T_4)\\). Unfortunately,\nthis sequent is not valid in the classical sense of being true in all\nmodels which satisfy the theory. Think for example of a situation in\nwhich the gun obscurely becomes unloaded while Vincent is smoking. In\nsuch a model, the precondition of the shooting action is clearly not\nmet and thus the action will lack any effects. Note that nothing rules\nout such a model since it is entirely consistent with our theory. We\nthus have to further constrain the models under consideration.\nCrucially, we have to find a way to deal with the non-effects of\nactions; this is the famous frame problem. \n\nHow to proceed? From the fact that no terminating action was\nmentioned, we want to conclude that no terminating event occurred. To\ndo so, we have to strengthen the assumptions of the theory in a way\nthat only those events are assumed to occur which have been explicitly\nstated in the discourse. The discourse model should be minimal,\nlinking discourse understanding intimately to closed world\nreasoning. It is important to note that this strategy forces\nreasoning to be non-monotonic: adding further premises to a theory can\nmake inferences invalid that were valid before (see the entry on \nnon-monotonic logic). \n",
