    "main_text": "Series, Ordinal Numbers and Real Numbers\n6. Series, Ordinal Numbers and Real Numbers\n\nWhitehead and Russell define a series in volume II of\nPrincipia Mathematica at \u2217204.01 as the class\nSer of all relations which is transitive, connected\nand irreflexive. A relation \\(R\\) is transitive when, if\n\\(xRy\\) and \\(yRz\\) then \\(xRz\\). It is connected when for\nany \\(x\\) and \\(y\\) for which it is defined, either \\(xRy\\) or\n\\(yRx\\). Finally, an irreflexive relation is one such that\nfor all \\(x\\), it is not the case that \\(xRx\\). Any relation that has\nthose properties forms a series of the things that it\nrelates. Such relations are now called \u201clinear orderings\u201d\nor simply, \u201corderings\u201d. Here the \u201clogical\nconstruction\u201d simply consists of an implicit definition of a\ncertain property of relations. There is certainly no thought that\nseries are merely invented \u201cfictions\u201d, and the symbol\n\u2018Ser\u2019 for them is\n\u201cincomplete\u201d only in that it can be explicitly defined as\nthe intersection of other classes (a class of classes) and classes are\nthemselves \u201cincomplete\u201d.\n\nRussell\u2019s definitions of ordinal numbers and real numbers\nresemble the definitions of natural numbers. Ordinal numbers are a\nspecial case of  relation numbers. Just as a cardinal number\ncan be defined as a class of similar classes where the similarity is\nsimply equinumerosity, the existence of a one to one mapping between\nthe two classes, a relation number is a class of similar classes which\nare ordered by some relation. Ordinal numbers are the relation numbers\nof well-ordered classes. \u201cRelation-Arithmetic\u201d is the\nsubject of Part IV of Volume II of Principia Mathematica,\nchapters \u2217150 to \u2217186. All of the properties of the\narithmetic of ordinal numbers are derived from the more general\narithmetic of relation numbers. Thus, for example, the addition of\nordinal numbers is not commutative. The first infinite ordinal\n\\(\\omega\\) is the relation number of the well-ordered classes similar\nto \\(1, 2, 3, \\ldots\\) etc. The sum \\(1 + \\omega\\) will be the\nrelation number of ordered classes which result from adding one\nelement at the beginning of the ordering, say \\(0, 1, 2, 3, \\ldots\\)\netc., which has the same ordinal number \\(\\omega\\). Thus \\(1 + \\omega\n= \\omega\\). On the other hand, adding an element at the\n\u201cend\u201d of such a well ordered class will give an ordering\nthat is not similar: \\(1, 2, 3, \\ldots \\text{etc.}, 0\\). Consequently,\n\\(1 + \\omega \\ne \\omega + 1\\). On the other hand addition of ordinals,\nand indeed relation numbers in general, is associative, that is,\n\\((\\alpha + \\beta) + \\gamma = \\alpha + (\\beta + \\gamma)\\), which is\nproved with certain restrictions in \u2217174. Ordinal numbers are\nthus defined exactly as natural numbers, as classes of similar\nclasses, in such a way that all the desired theorems can be proved.\nDescribing ordinal numbers as \u201cfictions\u201d,\n\u201cincomplete symbols\u201d and \u201cconstructions\u201d\napplies in the same way as in the case of natural numbers.\n\nThe class of real numbers, \u0398, is defined in Volume III of\nPrincipia Mathematica at \u2217310.01 as consisting of\n\u201cDedekindian series\u201d of rational numbers, which are in\nturn relation numbers of \u201cratios\u201d of natural numbers.\nWhitehead and Russell follow the account of real numbers as\nDedekind cuts of the rational numbers, and only differ from\nmore standard developments of the numbers in contemporary set theory\nby treating rational numbers as relation numbers of a certain sort,\nrather than ordered pairs of integers (the \u201cnumerator\u201d and\n\u201cdenominator\u201d). Like the construction of relation numbers\nas classes of similar classes, the \u201clogical construction\u201d\nof real numbers differs from the theory of definite descriptions and\nclasses in general in not defining \u201cincomplete symbols\u201d or\nby showing that these numbers are really \u201cfictions\u201d. They\nare best characterized as definitions that allow for the proof of\ntheorems about these numbers that would otherwise have to be\npostulated as axioms. They are the product of the \u201chonest\ntoil\u201d that Russell prefers.\n",
