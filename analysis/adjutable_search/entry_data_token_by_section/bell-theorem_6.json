Significance for Quantum Information Theory\n\nThe set-up envisaged in the proof of Bell\u2019s theorem highlights a\nstriking prediction of quantum theory, namely, long-distance\nentanglement, and experimental tests of the Bell inequalities provide\nconvincing evidence that it is a feature of reality. Moreover,\nBell\u2019s theorem reveals that the entanglement-based correlations\npredicted by quantum mechanics are strikingly different from the sort\nof locally explicable correlations familiar in a classical\ncontext.\n\nInvestigations into entanglement and the ways in which it can be\nexploited to perform tasks that would not be feasible with only\nclassical resources forms a key part of the discipline of quantum\ninformation theory (see Benatti, et al. eds. (2010), and the\nentries on\n quantum computing\n and\n quantum entanglement and information).\n In drawing attention to the import of entanglement and the ways in\nwhich it is different from anything in classical physics, Bell\u2019s\ntheorem and the experimental work derived from it provided, at least\nindirectly, some of the impetus to the development of quantum\ninformation theory.\n\nBell\u2019s theorem has played a direct role in the development of\ndevice independent quantum cryptography. One can exploit quantum\ncorrelations to devise a quantum key distribution protocol that is\nprovably secure on the assumption that, whatever the underlying\nphysics is, it does not permit superluminal signalling. The basic idea\nis that, if one has Bell inequality-violating correlations at\nspacelike separation, any predictability of the results beyond that\nafforded by the quantum probabilities could be exploited for\nsuperluminal signalling; the contrapositive of this is that impossibility of\nsignalling entails \u201cabsolute randomness\u201d \u2014 absolute\nin the sense of being independent of the details of the underlying\nphysics beyond the prohibition on superluminal\n signalling.[9]\n\n\nThe experiments demonstrating loophole-free violations of Bell\ninequalities take on particular significance in this context. The toy\nmodels demonstrating the reality of the detector inefficiency loophole\nlack physical plausibility, and, in the absence of conspiracies aimed\nat deceiving the experimenters, may be disregarded on the assumption\nthat nature, though subtle, is not malicious. Cryptography, on the\nother hand, by its very nature must take into account the possibility\nof a conspiracy aimed at deceiving the users of a cryptographic key,\nand so, in this context, it is essential to demonstrate security in\nthe presence of such a conspiracy. \n\nA result due to Colbeck and Renner (2011, 2016), building on work of\nBranciard et al. (2008), shows that this cannot be done if PI\nis satisfied. This result has significance both at the operational and\nthe fundamental level. It can be applied at the fundamental level to\nconclude that any theory with sharper probabilities than the quantum\npredictions must violate PI. In addition, even if some deterministic\ntheory (such as the de Broglie-Bohm theory) applies at the fundamental\nlevel, the Colbeck-Renner theorem can be applied at the operational\nlevel, where the probabilities involved may indicate limitations on\naccessible information about the physical state. A violation of PI at\nthe operational level would permit signalling. Thus, the theorem shows\nthat, as long as the no-signalling condition is satisfied, a would-be\neavesdropper attempting to subvert the privacy of a key distribution\nscheme by intercepting the particle pairs and substituting ones that\nwill yield results that she has some information about, cannot do so\nwithout disrupting the correlations between the particle pairs. See\nLeegwater (2016) for a clear exposition of the theorem.\n8. Philosophical/metaphysical implications\n\nBell inequalities follow from a number of assumptions that have\nintuitive plausibility and which, arguably, are rooted in the sort of\nworld-view that results from reflection on classical physics and\nrelativity theory. If one accepts that the experimental evidence gives\nus strong reason to believe that Bell inequality-violating\ncorrelations are features of physical reality, then one or more of\nthese assumptions must be given up. Some of these assumptions are of\nthe sort that have traditionally been regarded as metaphysical\nassumptions. The fact that a conjunction of theses of the sort usually\nregarded as metaphysical has consequences that can be subjected to\nexperimental test has led Shimony to speak\nof the enterprise of experimental testing for violations of Bell\ninequalities as \u201cexperimental metaphysics\u201d (Shimony 1984a, 35; 1993, 115). As may be\nexpected, the conclusions of experimental metaphysics are not\nunambiguous. Some prima facie plausible options are excluded,\nleaving a number of options open. In this section these are briefly\noutlined, with no attempt made to adjudicate between them.\n8.1. Options left open by experimental violation of Bell Inequalities\n\nSuppose that one accepts that the experimental evidence indicates that\nBell-inequality violating correlations are a real feature of the\nworld, even when the experiments are conducted at spacelike\nseparation, on the most stringent of conditions that advocates of a\ncollapse locality loophole might wish to impose (see section 3.2.3).\nAcceptance of the reality of such correlations requires rejection of\nthe conjunction of any set of assumptions sufficient to entail a Bell\ninequality. The analysis of the assumptions of the proof outlined in\nsection 3 affords a taxonomy of positions that one might adopt in\nlight of their experimental violation, as at least one of the\nassumptions must be rejected. The distinctive assumption is the\nPrinciple of Local Causality, which, when applied to the setup of\nBell-type experiments, is embodied in the factorizability condition.\nThis condition can be maintained only if one of the supplementary\nassumptions is rejected. We begin with options rejecting supplementary\nassumptions.\n8.1.1. Rejecting the supplementary assumptions\n\nAs we are considering implications of accepting Bell\ninequality violations as a feature of reality, even when the\nexperiments are performed at spacelike separation, we set aside the\ncollapse locality loophole. This leaves us with two options.\n\n\n\nReject unique outcomes. This is the option taken by\nEverettian, or Many-Worlds theories, and related interpretations of\nquantum mechanics. The question arises whether locality can be\nmaintained on this option. Posing the question of whether Bell\u2019s\ntheorem has implications for locality on Everettian or relative-state\ninterpretations requires that one first consider how to formulate\nlocality conditions in such a context, as the conditions formulated in\nsection 3.1, presuppose unique experimental outcomes. See Vaidman\n(1994), Bacciagaluppi (2002), Chapter 8 of Wallace (2012), Tipler\n(2014), Vaidman (2016), Brown and Timpson (2016), and Myrvold (2016)\nfor discussions of locality in Everettian interpretations, and Smerlak\nand Rovelli (2007) for a discussion in the context of relational\ninterpretations.\n\n\nReject the measurement independence assumption. There are\nessentially two ways to do this. One is to suppose a common cause in\nthe past that determines both experimental settings and experimental\noutcomes, as in the fanciful conspiracy story concocted by Shimony,\nHolt, and Clauser (1976). This sort of account has been called\nsuperdeterminism. Another avenue was suggested by Costa de\nBeauregard (1977), in a comment on the interchange between Bell and\nShimony, Holt, and Clauser. Costa de Beauregard objected that the\ndiscussants were disregarding the possibility of retrocausality, a\npossibility that he had advanced earlier (1976). If causal influence\nfrom future to past is admitted, then, even if the settings are\nregarded as free variables, they could influence the state of the\nsystem at the moment of preparation, contravening the assumption that\nthe preparation probability distribution be independent of\nexperimental settings.\n\nSuperdeterminism has gained some advocates, most notably Gerard\n\u2019t Hooft, who makes it a feature of his Cellular Automaton\nInterpretation of quantum mechanics (\u2019t Hooft 2016). It should\nbe noted that superdeterminism is a condition that is considerably\nstronger than mere determinism. It is uncontroversial that the sort of\ndevices that Bell speaks of, which have the effect of making the\nchoice setting of an experimental parameter depend on initial\nconditions in a way that is highly sensitive to small perturbations\nand which would ordinarily be accepted as effectively randomizing the\nchoice, do exist. Superdeterminism requires these settings to be\nnonetheless determined by the conditions at some past time, in such a\nway that the settings are distributed in just the right way to produce\nthe quantum statistics in Bell-type experiments, despite the\nunderlying physics being local, no matter what randomization\nmethod is employed. For example, in the experiment of Shalm\net al. (2015), the measurement decisions were determined by\napplying an XOR (exclusive or) operation to three bits from three\nindependent sources, one of which was a pseudorandom sequence\nconstructed from digits of \\(\\pi\\) and binary strings derived\nfrom various popular culture sources, including episodes of the movies\nMonty Python and the Holy Grail, the Back to the\nFuture trilogy, and episodes of Doctor Who, Saved by\nthe Bell, and Star Trek. A hypothetical cause that\nachieved the observed statistics via correlation between states of the\nphotons studied and the choice of measurements would have had to\nprecisely orchestrate the creative processes leading up to the\ndigitized versions of these cultural artifacts in such a way that,\nwhen processed in conjunction with the outputs of the random number\ngenerators, produced just the right sequence of experimental\nchoices.\n\nNo experiment can completely rule out the logical possibility of\nconspiracies of this sort. One can, however, conduct experiments that\nguarantee independence of the settings and the state of the systems at\nthe source on the basis of plausible physical assumptions. The\nexperiment of Scheidl et al. (2010) was the first to employ\nrandom-number generators operating at spacelike separation from the\ngeneration of the particle pairs at the source. Following a suggestion\nof Clauser, other tests have employed measurements on photons from\nMilky Way stars (Handsteiner et al. 2017) and from distant\nquasars (Rauch et al. 2018). In addition, the \u201cBig Bell\nTest\u201d ran experiments utilizing inputs provided by approximately\n100,000 volunteers (Abell\u00e1n et al. 2018). \n\n8.1.2. Rejecting Local Causality\n\nIf the auxiliary assumptions are accepted, then the lesson to be\ndrawn from the experimental violation of Bell inequalities is that the\ncondition that Bell called the Principle of Local Causality\nmust be rejected. As we have seen, this condition is a conjunction of\ntwo conditions: a causal locality condition (PLC-1, above), and the\nPrinciple of the Common Cause. The causal locality condition itself\ncan be regarded as stemming from the assumption that causes temporally\nprecede their effects and Lorentz invariance of the relation of\ntemporal precedence. If the relation of temporal precedence is to be Lorentz\ninvariant, then either it is the trivial relation that holds between\nany two spacetime points, or else the past of a spacetime point is its\npast light cone (Stein 1991, 2009).\n\nIn this context, it is useful to recall that the factorizability\ncondition can be thought of as a conjunction of outcome independence\n(OI) and parameter independence (PI). PI is a consequence of causal\nlocality (PLC-1), applied to the set-up of the Bell experiments,\nwhereas OI is a consequence of causal locality and the common cause\nprinciple. This leaves us with a dilemma. A rejection of\nfactorizability involves a rejection of PI or OI. A rejection of PI\ninvolves a rejection of causal locality. If causal locality is to be\nmaintained, then OI, and hence the Common Cause Principle, must be\nrejected.\n\nAny deterministic theory must satisfy OI, and hence, a deterministic\ntheory that rejects factorizability must reject causal locality. \n\nThese considerations yield a taxonomy of options for accepting the\nsupplementary assumptions while also accepting Bell-inequality\nviolating correlations. \n\n\n\nReject PLC-1. One option is to reject the assumption PLC-1 of\ncausal locality, and accept that there are causal relations between\nevents that are outside of each others\u2019 light-cones. There are\ntwo ways to do this.\n\nIntroduce non-relativistic spatiotemporal structure. One\noption, and perhaps the most straightforward one, is to reject the\nassumption of Lorentz invariant spatiotemporal structure at the\nfundamental level. This is the position that is involved in acceptance\nof the de Broglie-Bohm theory or any similar theory. On the de\nBroglie-Bohm theory, the velocity of a particle is a function not only\nof its own location but also of the location of any other particles it\nis entangled with. This means that the dynamics of the theory requires\na privileged relation of distant simultaneity.\nRetrocausality. Another option is to maintain the\nassumption that the past of an event is its past light cone, and\nthereby maintain Lorentz invariance of the spatiotemporal structure,\nbut to deny that causes must temporally precede their effects.\nTypically, those who take this option accept retrocausality,\nmaintaining that causal processes can propagated within light cones in\neither temporal direction. This avenue of explaining Bell-type\ncorrelations was introduced by Costa de Beauregard, and has been\nadvocated by Price and Wharton (Price 1994, 1996; Price and Wharton\n2015). It forms part of the Transactional Interpretation of quantum\nmechanics (Cramer 1986, 1988, 2016; Kastner 2013). \n\n\n\nReject the Principle of Common Cause. A stochastic theory,\nsuch as a dynamical collapse theory, that reproduces quantum\nprobabilities for Bell experiments, will involve correlated events at\nspacelike separation. It need not, however, involve any events in the\ncommon past of these events that screen off the correlations; these\ncorrelations will be built-in to the laws of the theory yielding\nprobabilities of events. Whether one is willing to extend talk of\ncause-effect relations to refer to the relation between such events is\nmerely a matter of terminology; it should be noted, however, that\nthere is nothing of the usual asymmetry between cause and effect in\nthe relation between these events. To accept this relation as a new\nsort of symmetric cause-effect relation removes any reason there is to\nthink that cause-effect relations between spacelike separated events\nare incompatible with relativistic spacetime structure.\n\nA more common view is that the lesson of Bell\u2019s theorem is that\nthere may be correlations that are not explicable in terms of\ncause-effect relations. This involves rejection of the Common Cause\nPrinciple (see, e.g., van Fraassen 1982, Fine 1989,\nButterfield 1992, Elby 1992). Others have maintained that, though the\nCommon Cause Principle as formulated by Reichenbach is to be rejected,\nthe principle has been formulated too narrowly, and  needs to\nbe reformulated in light of quantum phenomena. Some have suggested\nthat despite not satisfying Reichenbach\u2019s principle,\ncorrelations violating Bell inequalities are due to a common cause in\ntheir past, namely, the process that created entanglement (Unruh 2002,\n136). Hofer-Szabo, R\u00e9dei, and Szabo (1999, 2002) have suggested\na modification of the common cause principle, as have Leifer and\nSpekkens (Leifer 2006, Leifer and Spekkens 2011). See Cavalcanti and\nLal (2014) for discussion and a critique of these proposals.\n\n8.2. Quantum mechanics and relativity\n\nDoes Bell\u2019s theorem show that quantum theory is incompatible\nwith relativity? \n\nThe answer, of course, depends on what one takes relativity theory to\nrequire. It can be shown (Eberhard 1978, Ghirardi, Rimini & Weber\n1980, Page 1982) that, in the absence of nonlocal interaction terms in\nthe Hamiltonian, quantum correlations cannot be exploited to send\nsignals superluminally. There has been a tendency in some of the\nliterature to take this by itself to indicate compatibility with\nrelativity. That this is insufficient can be seen from the fact that\nthere can be theories, such as the de Broglie-Bohm theory, that\nrequire nonrelativistic spacetime structure for the formulation of\ntheir dynamical laws, while not permitting signalling (at least, as\nlong as the usual distribution postulate for particle positions is\nsatisfied). \n\nTake a relativistic spacetime structure to be a structure\nthat includes a relation of temporal precedence on which the past of a\nspacetime point is the set of points on or within its past lightcone,\nand its future, the set of points on or within its future lightcone,\nand other points are temporally unrelated to it, neither past nor\nfuture. One can ask whether a given account of the goings-on in the\nworld is compatible with a relativistic spacetime structure. If a\ntheory requires events outside of its lightcone to be partitioned into\nthose that are past, future, and simultaneous with a point, as does\nthe de-Broglie Bohm theory, it is not compatible with a relativistic\nspacetime structure. Compatibility of a theory with relativistic\nspacetime structure, in this sense, is a distinct issue from Lorentz\ncovariance of the equations expressing the theory\u2019s dynamical\nlaws. One can construct theories on which nonrelativistic\nspacetime structure is introduced dynamically, as is done by\nD\u00fcrr, Goldstein, M\u00fcnch-Berndl and Zangh\u00ec (1999), who\nformulate a Bohmian theory against a background of Minkowski spacetime\nby introducing an auxiliary field that picks out a distinguished\nfoliation that is then used to formulate the dynamics of the theory\n(see D\u00fcrr et al. 2014 for discussion). Berndl,\nD\u00fcrr, Goldstein, and Zangh\u00ec (1996) consider the class of\ntrajectory theories\u2014that is, theories that, like the de\nBroglie-Bohm theory, assign definite trajectories to\nparticles\u2014and prove that such theories could not satisfy the\nBorn-rule distribution postulate along arbitrary spacelike\nhyperplanes. The argument generalizes to any theories, such as modal\ninterpretations, that assign definite values to variables other\nthan position (Dickson and Clifton 1998, Arntzenius 1998, Myrvold\n2002). Theories of this sort, therefore, must invoke a distinguished\nfoliation.\n\nA deterministic theory must satisfy the condition of outcome\nindependence, and hence if one accepts \\((a)\\) that a violation\nof PI, that is, a situation in which the choice of an experiment on\none side changes the probability of an outcome on the other, is an\ninstance of causation, and \\((b)\\) that a cause must temporally\nprecede its effect, and then it follows that a deterministic theory\nthat satisfies the supplementary conditions and reproduces the quantum\ncorrelations is incompatible with relativistic spacetime structure.\nSuch a theory may, however, be Lorentz invariant at the phenomenal\nlevel, if (as in the de Broglie-Bohm theory) the distinguished\nfoliation is unobservable.\n\nA stochastic theory, such as a dynamical collapse theory, must involve\ncorrelations between spacelike separated events. A relation like that,\nhowever, is symmetric, and does not require that one of the events be\nin the past of the other. There is no prima facie need for\nnonrelativistic spacetime structure. Indeed, it is possible to\nformulate a fully relativistic dynamical collapse theory. A\nrelativistic generalization of the Ghirardi-Rimini-Weber (GRW) theory\nwas constructed by Dove (1996) and, independently, by Tumulka (2006).\nRelativistic versions of the Continuous Spontaneous Localization (CSL)\ntheory have been constructed by Bedingham (2011) and Pearle (2015).\nFor discussions of ontology for such theories, required to extract\nfrom them a sensible account of a world that includes macroscopic\nobjects, see Pearle (1997), Bedingham et al. (2014), and\nMyrvold (2019). \n\nShimony, in several of his writings (Shimony 1978, 1983, 1984a,b, 1986,\n1988, 1989, 1990, 1991) spoke of \u201cpeaceful coexistence\u201d\nbetween special relativity and quantum theory. The meaning of this\nvaried. In its initial formulation (1978), \u201cpeaceful\ncoexistence\u201d had to do with regarding experimental outcomes as\ntransitions from potentiality to actuality, something that, Shimony\nsays, requires further investigation to be understood. In later\nwritings, peaceful coexistence is \u201csuggested\u201d by the fact\nthat quantum correlations cannot be exploited for superluminal\nsignalling (Shimony 1983), though still associated with the notion\nthat quantum mechanics motivates a change in our conception of an\nevent (Shimony 1984a), and involves the requirement of a coherent\nmeshing of events as described with respect to different reference\nframes (1986). In other works peaceful coexistence seems to be simply\nidentified with the impossibility of exploiting quantum correlations\nfor signalling (Shimony 1984b, 1990, 1991). Convinced by Bell (1990)\nthat anthropocentric considerations such as manipulability have no\nplace in considerations of fundamental physics, Shimony became\ndissatisfied with this avenue of approach to reconciling relativity\nand quantum theory (Shimony 2009, 489). \n\nBell\u2019s own attitude towards the question of whether Bell\u2019s\ntheorem indicates a fundamental incompatibility between quantum theory\nand relativity seems to have varied with time. At the end of the 1964\narticle, he wrote \n\nIn a theory in which parameters are added to quantum mechanics to\ndetermine the results of individual measurements, without changing the\nstatistical predictions, there must be a mechanism whereby the\nsetting of one measuring device can influence the reading of another\ninstrument, however remote. Moreover, the signal involved must\npropagate instantaneously, so that such a theory could not be Lorentz\ninvariant (Bell 1964, 199; 1987b and 2004, 20).\n\n\nAt this point he is claiming incompatibility with relativity only for\ndeterministic hidden-variables theories. Later, however, he spoke of\n\u201cthe apparently essential conflict between any sharp formulation\n[of quantum theory] and fundamental relativity. That is to say, we\nhave an apparent incompatibility, at the deepest level, between the\ntwo fundamental pillars of contemporary theory\u2026\u201d (Bell\n1987b and 2004, 172; these are remarks from a meeting held in 1984).\nNote that this is hedged, and he speaks of \u201capparently\nessential\u201d conflict only. In the same year, he wrote, \u201cI\nam unable to prove, or even formulate clearly, the proposition that a\nsharp formulation of quantum field theory, such as that set out here,\nmust disrespect serious Lorentz invariance. But it seems to me that\nthis is probably so\u201d (1984, 7; 1987b and 2004, 180).\n\nA shift in attitude was occasioned by the publication of the GRW\ndynamical collapse theory (Ghirardi, Rimini, and Weber, 1986). In a\ncommentary on this theory, Bell wrote,\n\nI am particularly struck by the fact that the model is as Lorentz\ninvariant as it could be in the nonrelativistic version. It takes away\nthe ground of my fear that any exact formulation of quantum mechanics\nmust conflict with fundamental Lorentz invariance (1987a, 14; 1987b\nand 2004, 209).\n\n\nIn a lecture delivered in Trieste in the last year of his life, Bell\ndiscussed the prospects for a genuinely relativistic version of a\ndynamical collapse theory, and concluded that the difficulties\nencountered by Ghirardi, Grassi, and Pearle in producing a genuinely\nrelativistic version of the Continuous Spontaneous Localization theory\n(CSL), a theory that would be \u201cLorentz invariant, not just for\nall practical purposes but deeply, in the sense of Einstein,\neliminating entirely any privileged reference system from the\ntheory\u201d (2007, 2931), were \u201cSecond-Class\nDifficulties,\u201d technical difficulties, and not deep conceptual\nones. This seems to have been borne out by the construction of the\nfully relativistic collapse theories already mentioned.",
