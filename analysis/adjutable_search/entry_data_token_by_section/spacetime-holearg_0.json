Modern Spacetime Theories: A Beginner\u2019s Guide\n\nVirtually all modern spacetime theories are now built in the same way.\nThe theory posits a manifold of events and then assigns further\nstructures to those events to represent the content of spacetime. A\nstandard example is Einstein\u2019s general theory of relativity. As\na host for the hole argument, we will pursue one of its best known\napplications, the expanding universes of modern relativistic\ncosmology.\n\nThis one example illustrates the core content of the hole argument.\nWith only a little further effort, the argument can be made more\nprecise and general. This will be done concurrently in these\n notes,[1]\n intended for readers with some background in differential geometry\nand general relativity.\n\nHere are the two basic building blocks of modern, relativistic\ncosmology: a manifold of events and the fields defined on it.\n\nManifold of Events. Consider our universe, which\nrelativistic cosmologies attempt to model. Its spacetime is the\nentirety of all space through all time. The events of this spacetime\nare generalizations of the dimensionless points of ordinary spatial\ngeometry. A geometric point in ordinary spatial geometry is just a\nparticular spot in the space and has no extension. Correspondingly, an\nevent in spacetime is a particular point in a cosmological space at a\nparticular moment of time.\n\nSo far, all we have defined is a set of events. To be a\nfour-dimensional manifold, the set of events must be a little bit more\norganized. In a real spacetime, we have the idea that each event sits\nin some local neighborhood of events; and this neighborhood sits\ninside a larger neighborhood of events; and so on. That extra\norganization comes from the requirement that we can label the events\nwith four numbers\u2014or at least we can do this for any\nsufficiently small chunk of the manifold. These labels form coordinate\nsystems. The fact that four numbers are just sufficient to label the\nevents makes the manifold four-dimensional. We can now pick out\nneighborhoods of some event as the set of all points whose spacetime\ncoordinates differ from our starting event by at most one unit; or two\nunits; or three units; etc.. That gives us the nested neighborhoods of\nevents. Figure 1 illustrates how a set of events may be made into a\ntwo dimensional manifold by assigning \u201c\\(x\\)\u201d and\n\u201c\\(y\\)\u201d coordinates to the events.\n\n\n\nFigure 1. Forming a manifold of\nevents\n\n\nMetrical Structure and Matter Fields. In specifying\nthat events form a four dimensional manifold, there is still a lot we\nhave not said about the events. We have not specified which\nevents lie in the future and past of which other events, how much time\nelapses between these events, which events are simultaneous with\nothers so that they can form three dimensional spaces, what spatial\ndistances separates these events, and many more related\nproperties.\n\nThese additional properties are introduced by specifying the metric\nfield. To see how this field provides that information, imagine a\ncurve connecting a given pairs of events in spacetime. The information\nabout times elapsed and spatial distances is given by the times\nelapsed and distances along such curves. See Figure 2:\n\n\n\nFigure 2. The function of the metric\nfield.\n\n\nThat information could be supplied by a huge catalog that specifies\nthe spatial or temporal distance between pairs of events along curves\nconnecting them. Such a huge catalog would be massively redundant,\nhowever. If we know the distance from \\(A\\) to \\(B\\) and\nfrom \\(B\\) to \\(C\\) along some curve, then we know the\ndistance from \\(A\\) to \\(C\\) along that curve as well. The\nminimum information we need is the temporal and spatial distance\nbetween each event and all those (loosely speaking) infinitesimally\nclose to it. That information is what the metric field provides. It is\na \u201cfield\u201d since that information belongs just to one\nevent. We can then piece together temporal and spatial distance along\nany curve just by summing all the distances between successive\ninfinitesimally close points along the curve. \n\nThe matter of the universe is represented by matter fields. The\nsimplest form of matter\u2014the big lumps that make\ngalaxies\u2014can be represented by worldlines that trace out the\nhistory of each galaxy through time. In standard models, the galaxies\nrecede from one another and this is represented by a spreading apart\nof the galactic worldlines as we proceed to later times. See Figure\n3:\n\n\n\nFigure 3. Galaxies in an expanding\nuniverse.\n\n",
