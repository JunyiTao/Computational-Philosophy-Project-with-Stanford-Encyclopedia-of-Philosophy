    "main_text": "Soul and Nature\n4. Soul and Nature\nAccording to the second law of thermodynamics, structural and\ndispositional diversities present in the inanimate material world\nconverge towards irreversible entropy and disorder. In the biosphere,\nhowever, we witness a tendency to ever increasing diversification of\nnatural kinds and species. From a Neoplatonic point of view, this\nlatter fact is readily explained by the entirely non-Darwinian\nsupposition of eternal Forms of natural kinds in the hypostasis of\nConsciousness which gradually emerge in the world, limited by space\nand time, in some sort of evolutionary organic process. As has already\nbeen pointed out, the Neoplatonists assumed as axiomatic that nothing\ncould come to be here below that is not prefigured paradigmatically in\nthe intelligible realm.\nAlthough one might think that the phenomenon of evolution militates\nagainst Neoplatonic theory, it is actually compatible with it; to some\ndegree, it is precisely what we should expect as the empirical upshot\nof such metaphysical assumptions. Moreover, in distinction to the\nForms posited in the old Academy of Plato and his immediate\nsuccessors, the Forms of the Neoplatonists, far from being mere\nschemata, definitions, or ghostly blueprints of the natural world, are\nrather noetic entities teeming with conscious life. They actively and\ndynamically interrelate in such a way as to constitute a living noetic\ncosmos; and it is their rich inner life, the conscious activity of\nthoughts that they are, which is ultimately responsible for the\nappearance of images of them in space and time to make up the physical\nuniverse and everything contained in it. But this is by no means easy\nto understand. How exactly can images of eternal and immutable Forms,\nprefigured in Consciousness as such, become manifest in, and in fact\nconstitute, the material world?\nTo understand and explain how precisely it is that mind and matter\ninteract with one another in general is a considerable and perennial\nphilosophical problem. Approaches to it that start from modern\nmaterialist assumptions have not yielded plausible answers any more\nreadily than the Neoplatonists\u2019 idealist perspective. Even\nthough the Neoplatonists afforded it extensive treatment, they,\nunsurprisingly, have not satisfactorily explained it either. In a\nnutshell, the answer they gave has something to do with their\nfundamental understanding of the realm of the psychic. Plotinus in\nparticular struggled in long and meandering treatises to explicate the\nprecise functioning of the general phenomenon of what the ancients\ncalled \u201cSoul\u201d (psych\u00ea). Soul, a further\nhypostasis of being that effortlessly \u201cfalls out of\u201d the\ninner activity of Consciousness in a similar way as Consciousness\n\u201cfell out of\u201d the First, is the link that facilitates the\nmanifestation of form in matter. Their ingenious speculation about\nSoul, understood in its relationship to its cause (pure Consciousness)\non the one hand and its effect (the emergence of the living material\nuniverse) on the other, lies at the heart of Neoplatonism. In a manner\nof speaking, Neoplatonism is nothing but a philosophy of the soul, or\n\u201cpsychology\u201d in the original sense of that word.\nIn living beings, and human beings in particular, consciousness is\nbut one psychic activity among others. The realm of the psychic\nextends in a continuum from the loftiest processes of knowing, memory,\nand imagination down to the most rudimentary forms and expressions of\nlife that characterize the world\u2019s biosphere (natural processes\nof metabolism, growth, etc.). Many influential ancient thinkers, both\nphilosophers and poets, regarded the universe as a living being, not\nonly in its parts but also and especially as whole. In the\nTimaeus, Plato had described in detail the structure and\nfunction of the world soul, and had recounted the way in which it was\nput together by a divine craftsman (demiurge) and conjoined with the\nrealm of disorderly matter, upon which it controlled and imposed\norder.  Plotinus and his followers had a quite different view. There\nis no planning on account of anyone, no \u201cconstruction\u201d of\none metaphysical entity by another; instead, soul, that is to say the\ngeneral phenomenon of life capable of animating matter, is merely the\nmanifest outer aspect of the inner activity of Consciousness.\nThe general idea is that Soul, qua outer activity of\nConsciousness, looks back at its cause in order to understand\nitself so as to truly be what it is. Gazing thus at the forms and\nideas eternally present in Consciousness, it becomes\n\u201cinformed\u201d by them and carries forward, by some manner of\nbenevolent necessity, images of the eternal forms into the lower realm\nof Being. Giving birth to the entire universe and the biosphere on\nearth in this way, one could say that the sum total of the corporeal,\nsensible world rests in Soul, not the other way round, that soul\nresides in the bodies it animates.\nAccording to Neoplatonic theory, then, the world as we know and\nexperience it in its formal and structural characteristics is the\nouter effect of the activity and life of Consciousness, an activity\nthat was thought to be mediated \u201cfrom above\u201d by another,\nintermediate metaphysical entity, Soul. The precise ontological status\nof Soul as another hypostasis in its own right remains somewhat\nunderdetermined, for in a manner of speaking Soul is the very process\nof expressing the intelligible world in the derivative form of\nsensible natural living beings and the lives they live.\nThe Neoplatonists drew a distinction between \u201cSoul\u201d and\n\u201cNature\u201d (phusis) that amounts to a hierarchical\nseparation of higher and lower psychical functions. For the\nNeoplatonists, \u201cNature\u201d denotes not only the essence or\nnature of each natural being or the entirety of the natural world\n(Nature as a whole), but also, and in the first instance, a lower\naspect of conscious life (the \u201cautonomic\u201d life activities\nthat are not consciously controlled by the individual animal\u2019s\nconsciousness) which beholds, in a kind of diminished vision, relevant\naspects of the intelligible world and brings them forth in an act of\nsilent contemplation. Thus, every aspect of the natural world, even\nthe meanest piece of inorganic and apparently useless matter, has an\neternal and divine moment. For all the other-worldliness often\nassociated with Neoplatonic philosophy, then, it needs to be\nemphasized that the material world they inhabited was for this reason\nan essentially good and beautiful place, the effortless product of\ncosmic providence and divine power, and worthy of reverence.\n",
