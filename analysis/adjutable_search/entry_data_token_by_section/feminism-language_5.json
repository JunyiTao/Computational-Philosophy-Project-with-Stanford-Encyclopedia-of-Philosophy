Moreover, it may seem that they would be relatively easy to\ncorrect\u2014new terms can be invented, or alternative words can be\nused. Much feminist effort has been devoted to this endeavour, and a\nhuge variety of reforms have been proposed (see, for example, Miller\nand Swift 1976, 1980, and the papers in part two of Cameron\n1998a).\n\nOne especially successful reform effort has been the increasingly\naccepted singular use of the third-person gender-neutral pronoun\n\u2018they\u2019 (in place of \u2018he\u2019) as in the sentence\nbelow:\n\nSomebody left their sweater behind.\n\nA key reason for the success of this reform is perhaps the history of\nthe singular \u2018they\u2019. As Ann Bodine has noted (1975 [1998]), the\nsingular use of \u2018they\u2019 has a long history. It did not\nbegin to be criticized until the 19th century, and despite\nall the efforts of prescriptive grammarians it has remained very\npopular in speech. Due to feminist work on the effects of\n\u2018gender-neutral\u2019 use of \u2018he\u2019, even\nprescriptive grammarians are now becoming more accepting of\n\u2018they\u2019. In very recent years, it is also becoming\nincreasingly widespread to use \u2018they\u2019 as one\u2019s\nchosen personal pronoun, or, less frequently, to use another\ngender-neutral option such as \u2018ze\u2019 (Bennett 2016; Dembroff and Wodak 2017).\n\nOther reform efforts have met with greater difficulties. Even some\nthat have caught on seem to have backfired. Susan Erlich and Ruth King\n(1992 [1998]), for example, discuss the case of \u2018chairperson\u2019,\nintended to serve as a gender-neutral replacement for\n\u2018chairman\u2019. Instead, in many places it is often used to\nindicate women who fill the post of chair, while men are referred to\nas \u2018chairman\u2019. They take this to show that reforms cannot\nsucceed unless attitudes change as well.\n\nMoreover, feminist work on language has also indicated that there may\nbe problems which are simply not amenable to piecemeal linguistic\nreforms. Some difficulties that have been raised go well beyond a\nhandful of problematic terms or gaps. Deborah Cameron offers striking\nexamples of writing that take males as the norm without using any\nparticular terms to which one might object, such as the following,\nfrom The Sunday Times:\n\n\nThe lack of vitality is aggravated by the fact that there are so few\nable-bodied young adults about. They have all gone off to work or look\nfor work, leaving behind the old, the disabled, the women and the\nchildren. (Cameron 1985: 85)\n\n\nClearly, in the above example, \u2018able-bodied young adult\u2019\nis being used in such a way as to exclude women. Moreover, examples\nlike this (and others Cameron provides) pass unnoticed by newspaper\neditors and many readers. There is clearly a problem, but it is not a\nproblem that can be pinpointed by picking out some particular term as\nobjectionable and in need of reform. Eliminating language use that\ntakes males as the norm, then, must involve more than changing a few\nterms or usage rules.\n",
