    "main_text": "Fundamental Themes in Feminist Legal Philosophy || Multiple Methodologies\n1.6 Multiple Methodologies\n\nMethodologically, feminist philosophy of law draws a great deal from\nfeminist work in other areas of philosophy and has broken new ground\nas well. Feminist\n epistemological accounts\n of epistemic injustice and the social nature of knowledge are\nespecially salient to many questions about and within law (McKinnon\n2016). Trials, after all, depend on testimony. Fricker (2007)\nconsiders both testimonial injustice and hermeneutical injustice.\nTestimonial injustice occurs when people are discounted as credible\nbecause of stereotypes such as those rooted in sex or race; it may\nalso occur when people are assessed as overly credible for similar\nreasons, likely to the detriment of the credibility accorded others\n(Medina 2013). For example, a woman\u2019s testimony may be\ndiscounted in allegations of rape in the face of her assailant\u2019s\nclaim of consent. To take another example, claims of asylum seekers\nabout threats they face in their home countries may be disbelieved.\nHermeneutical injustice occurs when others do not even have the\nconcepts to understand what someone is saying, as when a victim of sex\ntrafficking claims she was coerced but police or immigration\nauthorities can only visualize her as an economic migrant. Work of\nAfrican-American feminists such as Dotson (2011) present especially\npowerful accounts of race-based epistemic injustice. An additional\nillustration of the importance of feminist epistemology is the\ndevelopment of understanding of first person standpoints. This work\nhas informed discussions of victim protection, for example (Schroeder\n1991).\n\nWork in relational metaphysics has helped in analysis of how legal\ninstitutions should reflect connections among people, including care\nrelationships (McClain 1992; West 1988). Many feminist writers in this\ntradition have taken pains to distance themselves from simplistic\nessentialist assumptions about the way women think or the role of\nwomen as caregivers, emphasizing instead the importance of context to\nunderstanding. Feminist theory has inspired and deployed new forms of\nlegal realism\u2014the view that law reflects its social\ncontext\u2014to criticize the frequent formalism of approaches to law\nin terms of economic relationships and rational choice (Nourse &\nShaffer 2009). Feminist scholarship on human rights\u2014viewed in\nthe abstract as universal\u2014has also emphasized the importance of\nlived experiences in context (Halley et al. 2006). Debate about\nwhether all forms of prostitution should be prohibited, or whether\nthere is room for a liberal view that would distinguish coerced\ntrafficking from voluntary sex work, is but one illustration of such\nscholarship. Legal archaeology, understood as exploration of cases in\ntheir full context, is a method developed by Threedy (2010) and others\nfor criticizing the formalism of much legal analysis and revealing the\nextent to which gendered norms permeate legal doctrines such as\ndefenses in contract law. Feminists interested in criticizing\nparadigms of rationality and breaking down supposed divisions between\nreason and emotion have questioned whether there is a too-ready\nwillingness to reject emotions in supposedly non-gendered contexts\nsuch as the law of evidence where the rules are constructed to\neliminate appeals to emotion as irrelevant\u2014but a too-ready\nacceptance of emotion in contexts where women are stereotyped and\ndisadvantaged, as with the Supreme Court\u2019s assertion that the\nstate has an interest in protecting women from partial birth abortion\nbecause they might later come to regret their decisions (Abrams &\nKeren 2010).\n\nIntersectionality theory is an especially important recent development\nin feminist methodology of relevance to philosophy of law. Feminists\nusing an analysis of intersections between race, sex, and other\nidentity categories discern essentialist tendencies that gloss the\ncomplexities of identity in the work of both radical and liberal\nfeminists (Crenshaw 2012, Harris 1990). Intersectionality theorizes\nhow locations in multiple socially constructed categories such as\ngender, race, class, or disability affect how people live (Jones 2013,\nHaslanger 2012). Theorizing without intersectionality made women of\ncolor and other multiply oppressed people invisible; keeping\ncategories such as race and sex separate made it more difficult to\nachieve justice for persons who were multiply oppressed.\nIntersectionality creates interlocking and superimposed axes of\nprivilege or disadvantage (Haslanger 2012). An illustration can be\nfound in ways that prison violence arguably tracks intersections\nbetween vulnerability and identity categories, with images of female\nvulnerability both reinforcing sexist thinking and contributing to the\noppression inflicted by the racist carceral state (Gilson 2016). \n",
