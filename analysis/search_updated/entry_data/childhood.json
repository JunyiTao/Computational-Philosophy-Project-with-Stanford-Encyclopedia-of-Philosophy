    "main_text": "\n1. What is a Child?\n\nAlmost single-handedly, Philippe Ari\u00e8s, in his influential\nbook, Centuries of Childhood (Ari\u00e8s, 1962), made the\nreading public aware that conceptions of childhood have varied across\nthe centuries. The very notion of a child, we now realize, is both\nhistorically and culturally conditioned. But exactly how the\nconception of childhood has changed historically and how conceptions\ndiffer across cultures is a matter of scholarly controversy and\nphilosophical interest (see Kennedy, 2006). Thus Ari\u00e8s argued,\npartly on the evidence of depictions of infants in medieval art, that\nthe medievals thought of children as simply \u201clittle\nadults.\u201d Shulamith Shahar (1990), by contrast, finds evidence\nthat some medieval thinkers understood childhood to be divided into\nfairly well-defined stages. And, whereas Piaget claims that his\nsubjects, Swiss children in the first half of the 20th Century, were\nanimistic in their thinking (Piaget, 1929), Margaret Mead (1967)\npresents evidence that Pacific island children were not.\n\nOne reason for being skeptical about any claim of radical\ndiscontinuity\u2014at least in Western conceptions of\nchildhood\u2014arises from the fact that, even today, the dominant\nview of children embodies what we might call a broadly\n\u201cAristotelian conception\u201d of childhood. According to\nAristotle, there are four sorts of causality, one of which is Final\ncausality and another is Formal Causality. Aristotle thinks of the\nFinal Cause of a living organism as the function that organism\nnormally performs when it reaches maturity. He thinks of the Formal\nCause of the organism as the form or structure it normally has in\nmaturity, where that form or structure is thought to enable the\norganism to perform its functions well. According to this conception,\na human child is an immature specimen of the organism type, human,\nwhich, by nature, has the potentiality to develop into a mature\nspecimen with the structure, form, and function of a normal or\nstandard adult.\n\nMany adults today have this broadly Aristotelian conception of\nchildhood without having actually read any of Aristotle. It informs\ntheir understanding of their own relationship toward the children\naround them. Thus they consider the fundamental responsibility they\nbear toward their children to be the obligation to provide the kind of\nsupportive environment those children need to develop into normal\nadults, with the biological and psychological structures in place\nneeded to perform the functions we assume that normal, standard adults\ncan perform.\n\nTwo modifications of this Aristotelian conception have been\nparticularly influential in the last century and a half. One is the\n19th century idea that ontogeny recapitulates phylogeny\n(Gould, 1977), that is, that the development of an individual\nrecapitulates the history and evolutionary development of the race, or\nspecies (Spock, 1968, 229). This idea is prominent in Freud (1950) and\nin the early writings of Jean Piaget (see, e.g. Piaget, 1933). Piaget,\nhowever, sought in his later writings to explain the phenomenon of\nrecapitulation by appeal to general principles of structural change in\ncognitive development (see, e.g., Piaget, 1968, 27).\n\nThe other modification is the idea that development takes places in\nage-related stages of clearly identifiable structural change.\nThis idea can be traced back to ancient thinkers, for example the\nStoics (Turner and Matthews, 1998, 49). Stage theory is to be found in\nvarious medieval writers (Shahar, 1990, 21\u201331) and, in the\nmodern period, most prominently in Jean-Jacques Rousseau\u2019s\nhighly influential work, Emile (1979). But it is Piaget who\nfirst developed a highly sophisticated version of stage theory and\nmade it the dominant paradigm for conceiving childhood in the latter\npart of the 20th Century (see, e.g., Piaget, 1971).\n\nMatthews (2008, 2009), argues that a Piagetian-type stage theory of\ndevelopment tends to support a \u201cdeficit conception\u201d of\nchildhood, according to which the nature of the child is understood\nprimarily as a configuration of deficits\u2014missing capacities that\nnormal adults have but children lack. This conception, he argues,\nignores or undervalues the fact that children are, for example, better\nable to learn a second language, or paint an aesthetically worthwhile\npicture, or conceive a philosophically interesting question, than\nthose same children will likely be able to do as adults. Moreover, it\nrestricts the range and value of relationships adults think they can\nhave with their children.\n\nBroadly Aristotelian conceptions of childhood can have two further\nproblematic features. They may deflect attention away from thinking\nabout children with disabilities in favour of theorizing solely about\nnormally developing children (see Carlson 2010), and they may distract\nphilosophers from attending to the goods of childhood when they think\nabout the responsibilities adults have towards the children in their\ncare, encouraging focus only on care required to ensure that children\ndevelop adult capacities.\n\nHow childhood is conceived is crucial for almost all the\nphilosophically interesting questions about children. It is also\ncrucial for questions about what should be the legal status of\nchildren in society, as well as for the study of children in\npsychology, anthropology, sociology, and many other fields.\n2. Theories of Cognitive Development\n\nAny well-worked out epistemology will provide at least the materials\nfor a theory of cognitive development in childhood. Thus, according to\nRen\u00e9 Descartes, a clear and distinct knowledge of the world can\nbe constructed from resources innate to the human mind (Descartes, PW,\n131). John Locke, by contrast, maintains that the human mind begins as\na \u201cwhite paper, void of all characters, without any ideas\u201d\n(Locke, EHC, 121). On this view all the \u201cmaterials of reason and\nknowledge\u201d come from experience. Locke\u2019s denial of the\ndoctrine of innate ideas was, no doubt, directed specifically at\nDescartes and the Cartesians. But it also implies a rejection of the\nPlatonic doctrine that learning is a recollection of previously known\nForms. Few theorists of cognitive development today find either the\nextreme empiricism of Locke or the strong innatism of Plato or\nDescartes completely acceptable.\n\nBehaviorism has offered recent theorists of cognitive development a\nway to be strongly empiricist without appealing to Locke\u2019s inner\ntheater of the mind. The behaviorist program was, however, dealt a\nmajor setback when Noam Chomsky, in his review (1959) of\nSkinner\u2019s Verbal Behavior (1957), argued successfully\nthat no purely behaviorist account of language-learning is possible.\nChomsky\u2019s alternative, a theory of Universal Grammar, which owes\nsome of its inspiration to Plato and Descartes, has made the idea of\ninnate language structures, and perhaps other cognitive structures as\nwell, seem a viable alternative to a more purely empiricist conception\nof cognitive development.\n\nIt is, however, the work of Jean Piaget that has been most influential\non the way psychologists, educators, and even philosophers have come\nto think about the cognitive development of children. Piaget\u2019s\nearly work, The Child\u2019s Conception of the World (1929),\nmakes especially clear how philosophically challenging the work of a\ndevelopmental psychologist can be. Although his project is always to\nlay out identifiable stages in which children come to understand what,\nsay, causality or thinking or whatever is, the intelligibility of his\naccount presupposes that there are satisfactory responses to the\nphilosophical quandaries that topics like causality, thinking, and\nlife raise.\n\nTake the concept of life. According to Piaget this concept is acquired\nin four stages (Piaget, 1929, Chapter 6)\n\nFirst Stage: Life is assimilated to activity in general\nSecond Stage: Life is assimilated to movement\nThird Stage: Life is assimilated to spontaneous movement\nFourth Stage: Life is restricted to animals and plants\n\n\nThese distinctions are suggestive, but they invite much more\ndiscussion than Piaget elicits from his child subjects. What is\nrequired for movement to be spontaneous? Is a bear alive during\nhibernation? We may suppose the Venus flytrap moves spontaneously. But\ndoes it really? What about other plants? And then there is the\nquestion of what Piaget can mean by calling the thinking of young\nchildren \u201canimistic,\u201d if, at their stage of cognitive\ndevelopment, their idea of life is simply \u201cassimilated to\nactivity in general.\u201d\n\nDonaldson (1978) offers a psychological critique of Piaget on\ncognitive development. A philosophical critique of Piaget\u2019s work\non cognitive development is to be found in Chapters 3 and 4 of\nMatthews (1994). Interesting post-Piagetian work in cognitive\ndevelopment includes Cary (1985), Wellman (1990), Flavel (1995),\nSubbotsky (1996), and Gelman (2003).\n\nPsychological research on concept formation has suggested that\nchildren do not generally form concepts by learning necessary and\nsufficient conditions for their application, but rather by coming to\nuse prototypical examples as reference guides. Thus a robin (rather,\nof course, than a penguin) might be the child\u2019s prototype for\n\u2018bird\u2019. The child, like the adult, might then be credited\nwith having the concept, bird, without the child\u2019s ever being\nable to specify, successfully, necessary and sufficient conditions for\nsomething to count as a bird. This finding seems to have implications\nfor the proper role and importance of conceptual analysis in\nphilosophy. It is also a case in which we should let what we come to\nknow about cognitive development in children help shape our\nepistemology, rather than counting on our antecedently formulated\nepistemology to shape our conception of cognitive development in\nchildren (see Rosch and Lloyd, 1978, and Gelman, 2003).\n\nSome developmental psychologists have recently moved away from the\nidea that children are to be understood primarily as human beings who\nlack the capacities adults of their species normally have. This change\nis striking in, for example, the work of Alison Gopnik, who writes:\n\u201cChildren aren\u2019t just defective adults, primitive grownups\ngradually attaining our perfection and complexity. Instead, children\nand adults are different forms of homo sapiens. They have very\ndifferent, though equally complex and powerful, minds, brains, and\nforms of consciousness, designed to serve different evolutionary\nfunctions\u201d (Gopnik, 2009, 9). Part of this new respect for the\ncapacities of children rests on neuroscience and an increased\nappreciation for the complexity of the brains of infants and young\nchildren. Thus Gopnik writes: \u201cBabies\u2019 brains are actually\nmore highly connected than adult brains; more neural pathways are\navailable to babies than adults.\u201d (11)\n3. Theories of Moral Development\n\nMany philosophers in the history of ethics have devoted serious\nattention to the issue of moral development. Thus Plato, for example,\noffers a model curriculum in his dialogue, Republic, aimed at\ndeveloping virtue in rulers. Aristotle\u2019s account of the logical\nstructure of the virtues in his Nicomachean Ethics provides a\nscaffolding for understanding how moral development takes place. And\nthe Stoics (Turner and Matthews, 1998, 45\u201364) devoted special\nattention to dynamics of moral development.\n\nAmong modern philosophers, it is again Rousseau (1762) who devotes the\nmost attention to issues of development. He offers a sequence of five\nage-related stages through which a person must pass to reach moral\nmaturity: (i) infancy (birth to age 2); (ii) the age of sensation (3\nto 12); (iii) the age of ideas (13 to puberty); (iv) the age of\nsentiment (puberty to age 20); and (v) the age of marriage and social\nresponsibility (age 21 on). Although he allows that an adult may\neffectively modify the behavior of children by explaining that bad\nactions are those that will bring punishment (1762 [1979, 90]), he\ninsists that genuinely moral reasoning will not be appreciated until\nthe age of ideas, at 13 and older. In keeping with his stage theory of\nmoral development he explicitly rejects Locke\u2019s maxim,\n\u2018Reason with children\u2019 (Locke, JLE), on the ground that\nattempting to reason with a child younger than thirteen years of age\nis developmentally inappropriate.\n\nHowever, the cognitive theory of moral development formulated by\nPiaget in The Moral Judgment of the Child (1965) and the\nsomewhat later theory of Lawrence Kohlberg (1981, 1984) are the ones\nthat have had most influence on psychologists, educators, and even\nphilosophers. Thus, for example, what John Rawls has to say about\nchildren in his classic work, A Theory of Justice (1971)\nrests heavily on the work of Piaget and Kohlberg.\n\nKohlberg presents a theory according to which morality develops in\napproximately six stages, though according to his research, few adults\nactually reach the fifth or sixth stages. In this respect\nKohlberg\u2019s theory departs from classic stage theory, as in\nPiaget, since the sequence of stages does not culminate in the\ncapacity shared by normal adults. However, Kohlberg maintained that no\none skips a stage or regresses to an earlier stage. Although Kohlberg\nsometimes considered the possibility of a seventh or eighth stage,\nthese are his basic six: the premoral (the 1st involving punishment\nand obedience, and the 2nd naive hedonism), the morality of\nconventional role conformity (the 3rd involving seeking good\nrelations, the 4th maintaining authority) and the morality of accepted\nprinciples (the 5th involving the morality of contract, individual\nrights and accepted law, the 6th individual principles of conscience).\n\n\nKohlberg developed a test, which has been widely used, to determine\nthe stage of any individual at any given time. The test requires\nresponses to ethical dilemmas and is to be scored by consulting an\nelaborate manual.\n\nOne of the most influential critiques of the Kohlberg theory is to be\nfound in Carol Gilligan\u2019s In a Different Voice (1982).\nGilligan argues that Kohlberg\u2019s rule-oriented conception of\nmorality has an orientation toward justice, which she associates with\nstereotypically male thinking, whereas women and girls are perhaps\nmore likely to approach moral dilemmas with a \u201ccare\u201d\norientation. One important issue in moral theory that the\nKohlberg-Gilligan debate raises is that of the role and importance of\nmoral feelings in the moral life (see the entry on\n feminist ethics).\n\nAnother line of approach to moral development is to be found in the\nwork of Martin Hoffman (1982). Hoffman describes the development of\nempathetic feelings and responses in four stages. Hoffman\u2019s\napproach allows one to appreciate the possibility of genuine moral\nfeelings, and so of genuine moral agency, in a very small child. By\ncontrast, Kohlberg\u2019s moral-dilemma tests will assign\npre-schoolers and even early elementary-school children to a pre-moral\nlevel.\n\nA philosophically astute and balanced assessment of the\nKohlberg-Gilligan debate, with appropriate attention to the work of\nMartin Hoffman, can be found in Pritchard (1991). See also Friedman\n(1987), Likona (1976), Kagan and Lamb (1987), and Pritchard\n(1996).\n\nWhile much of the discussion of children\u2019s moral development has\noccurred within psychology, some recent philosophical work on the\ntopic has emerged, with a particular focus on questions about whether\nchildren can be held resposible for either or both of morally\npraiseworthy actions and those that would be considered morally\nblameworthy if performed by adults (Burroughs 2020, Tiboris 2014).\n4. Children\u2019s Rights\n\nFor a full discussion of children\u2019s interests and\nchildren\u2019s rights see the entry on the\n rights of children.\n5. Childhood Agency and Autonomy\n\nClearly children are capable of goal-directed behavior while still\nrelatively young, and are agents in this minimal sense. Respect for\nchildren\u2019s agency is provided in legal and medical contexts, in\nthat children who are capable of expressing their preferences are\nfrequently consulted, even if their views are not regarded as decisive\nfor determining outcomes.\n\nThe exercise of childhood agency will obviously be constrained by\nsocial and political factors, including various dependency relations,\nsome of them imposed by family structures. Whether there are special\nethical rules and considerations that pertain to the family in\nparticular, and, if so, what these rules or considerations are, is the\nsubject of an emerging field we can call \u2018family ethics\u2019\n(Baylis and McLeod 2014, Blustein, 1982, Brighouse and Swift 2014,\nHoulgate, 1980, 1999).\n\nThe idea that, in child-custody cases, the preferences of a child\nshould be given consideration, and not just the \u201cbest\ninterest\u201d of the child, is beginning to gain acceptance in the\nU.S., Canada and Europe. \u201cGregory K,\u201d who at age 12 was\nable to speak rationally and persuasively to support his petition for\nnew adoptive parents, made a good case for recognizing childhood\nagency in a family court. (See \u201cGregory Kingsley\u201d in the\nOther Internet Resources.) Less dramatically, in divorce proceedings,\nolder children are routinely consulted for their views about proposed\narrangements for their custody.\n\nPerhaps the most wrenching cases in which adults have come to let\nchildren play a significant role in deciding their own future are\nthose that involve treatment decisions for children with terminal\nillnesses. (Kopelman and Moskop, 1989) The pioneering work of Myra\nBluebond-Langner shows how young children can come to terms with their\nown imminent death and even conspire, mercifully, to help their\nparents and caregivers avoid having to discuss this awful truth with\nthem (Bluebond-Langner, 1980).\n\nWhile family law and medical ethics are domains in which children\ncapable of expressing preferences are increasingly encouraged to do\nso, there remains considerable controversy within philosophy as to the\nkind of authority that should be given to children\u2019s\npreferences. There is widespread agreement that most children\u2019s\ncapacity to eventually become autonomous is morally important and that\nadults who interact with them have significant responsibility to\nensure that this capacity is nurtured (Feinberg 1980). At the same\ntime it is typical for philosophers to be skeptical about the capacity\nfor children under the age of ten to have any capacity for autonomy,\neither because they are judged not to care stably about anything\n(Oshana 2005, Schapiro 1999), lack information, experience and\ncognitive maturity (Levinson 1999, Ross 1998), or are too poor at\ncritical reflection (Levinson 1999).\n\nMullin (2007, 2014) argues that consideration of children\u2019s\ncapacity for autonomy should operate with a relatively minimal\nunderstanding of autonomy as self-governance in the service of what\nthe person cares about (with the objects of care conceived broadly to\ninclude principles, relationships, activities and things).\nChildren\u2019s attachment to those they love (including their\nparents) can therefore be a source of autonomy. When a person, adult\nor child, acts autonomously, he or she finds the activity meaningful\nand embraces the goal of the action. This contrasts both with a lack\nof motivation and with feeling pressured by others to achieve outcomes\ndesired by them. Autonomy in this sense requires capacities for\nimpulse control, caring stably about some things, connecting\none\u2019s goals to one\u2019s actions, and confidence that one can\nachieve at least some of one\u2019s goals by directing one\u2019s\nactions. It does not require extensive ability to engage in critical\nself-reflection, or substantive independence. The ability to act\nautonomously in a particular domain will depend, however, on whether\none\u2019s relationships with others are autonomy supporting. This is\nin keeping with feminist work on relational autonomy. See the entry on\n Feminist Perspectives on Autonomy.\n\nThe orthodox position that children are paradigmatic examples of a\nlack of autonomy has begun to change as more philosophers argue that\neven children far from the cusp of adulthood may be capable of acting\nautonomously in some areas of their lives (Bou-Habib and Olsaretti\n2104, Hannan 2018a, Mullin 2007, 2014). However, others argue that\neven when children have capacities like those possessed by adults,\nsocieties shold protect children rather than deferring to their\nautonomy when children\u2019s decisions might lead to very negative\nconsequences for them (Betzler 2022, Claassen and Anderson 2012,\nFranklin-Hall 2013).\n\nChildren\u2019s autonomy is supported when adults give them relevant\ninformation, reasons for their requests, demonstrate interest in\nchildren\u2019s feelings and perspectives, and offer children\nstructured choices that reflect those thoughts and feelings. Support\nfor children\u2019s autonomy in particular domains of action is\nperfectly consistent with adults behaving paternalistically toward\nthem at other times and in other domains, when children are\nill-informed, extremely impulsive, do not appreciate the long-term\nconsequences of their actions, cannot recognize what is in their\ninterest, cannot direct their actions to accord with their interests,\nor are at risk of significant harm (Mullin 2014).\n6. The Goods (and Bads?) of Childhood\n\n\u201cRefrigerator art,\u201d that is, the paintings and drawings of\nyoung children that parents display on the family\u2019s\nrefrigerator, is emblematic of adult ambivalence toward the\nproductions of childhood. Typically, parents are pleased with, and\nproud of, the art their children produce. But equally typically,\nparents do not consider the artwork of their children to be good\nwithout qualification. Yet, as Jonathan Fineberg has pointed out\n(Fineberg, 1997, 2006), several of the most celebrated artists of the\n20th century collected child art and were inspired by it. It may be\nthat children are more likely as children to produce art, the\naesthetic value of which a famous artist or an art historian can\nappreciate, than they will be able to later as adults.\n\nAccording to what we have called the \u201cAristotelian\nconception\u201d, childhood is an essentially prospective state. On\nsuch a view, the value of what a child produces cannot be expected to\nbe good in itself, but only good for helping the child to develop into\na good adult. Perhaps some child art is a counterexample to this\nexpectation. Of course, one could argue that adults who, as children,\nwere encouraged to produce art, as well as make music and excel at\ngames, are more likely to be flourishing adults than those who are not\nencouraged to give such \u201coutlets\u201d to their energy and\ncreativity. But the example of child art should at least make one\nsuspicious of Michael Slote\u2019s claim that \u201cjust as dreams\nare discounted except as they affect (the waking portions of) our\nlives, what happens in childhood principally affects our view of total\nlives through the effects that childhood success or failure are\nsupposed to have on mature individuals\u201d (Slote, 1983, 14).\n\nRecent philosophical work on the goods of childhood (Brennan 2014,\nGheaus 2014, Macleod 2010) stresses that childhood should not be\nevaluated solely insofar as it prepares the child to be a fully\nfunctioning adult. Instead, a good childhood is of intrinsic and not\nmerely instrumental value. Different childhoods that equally prepare\nchildren to be capable adults may be better or worse, depending on how\nchildren fare qua children. Goods potentially specific to childhood\n(or, more likely, of greatest importance during childhood) include\nopportunities for joyful and unstructured play and social\ninteractions, lack of significant responsibility, considerable free\ntime, and innocence, particularly sexual innocence. Play, for\ninstance, can be of considerable value not only as a means for\nchildren to acquire skills and capacities they will need as adults,\nbut also for itself, during childhood.\n\nEven more recently, some philosophers (Hannan 2018b, Hannan and Leland\n2018) have questioned whether there are features of childhood that\nmake childhood bad for children. Candidate bad-making features include\nchildren\u2019s impaired practical identity, their being\nasymmetrically physically and emotionally vulnerable to their parents\nand needing extensive control by them, and their lack of a fixed\npractical identity. Any evaluation of features that are particularly\nvaluable in childhood, and either uniquely or more easily accessed in\nchildhood, should be balanced against consideration of features that\nmake it a worse stage of life than adulthood. Bad-making features of\nchildhood may be traced either to aspects of childhood that cannot be\nchanged or to contingent social arrangements that may leave children\nvulnerable to abuse or neglect at the hands of their intimate\ncaregivers, without much opportunity for recourse.\n7. Philosophical Thinking in Children\n\nFor a full discussion of this topic see the entry on\n Philosophy for Children.\n8. Moral Status of Children\n\nIt is uncontroversial to judge that what Mary Anne Warren terms\nparadigmatic humans have moral status (Warren 1992). Paradigmatic\nhumans are adults with relatively standard cognitive capacities for\nself-control, self-criticism, self-direction, and rational thought,\nand are capable of moral thought and action. However, the grounds for\nthis status are controversial, and different grounds for moral status\nhave direct implications for the moral status of children. Jan\nNarveson (1988), for instance, argues that children do not have moral\nstatus in their own right because only free rational beings, capable\nof entering into reciprocal relations with one another, have\nfundamental rights. While Narveson uses the language of rights in his\ndiscussion of moral status (people have direct moral duties only to\nrights holders on his account), moral status need not be discussed in\nthe language of rights. Many other philosophers recognize children as\nhaving moral status because of their potential to become paradigmatic\nhumans without committing to children having rights. For instance,\nAllen Wood writes: \u201cit would show contempt for rational nature\nto be indifferent to its potentiality in children.\u201d (Wood 1998,\n198)\n\nWhen children are judged to have moral status because of their\npotential to develop the capacities of paradigmatic adults (we might\ncall these paradigmatic children), this leaves questions about the\nmoral status of those children who are not expected to live to\nadulthood, and those children whose significant intellectual\ndisabilities compromise their ability to acquire the capacities of\nparadigmatic adults. There are then three common approaches that grant\nmoral status to non-paradigmatic children (and other non-paradigmatic\nhumans). The first approach deems moral consideration to track species\nmembership. On this approach all human children have moral status\nsimply because they are human (Kittay 2005). This approach has been\ncriticized as being inappropriately speciesist, especially by animal\nrights activists. The second approach gives moral status to children\nbecause of their capacity to fare well or badly, either on\nstraightforwardly utilitarian grounds or because they have subjective\nexperiences (Dombrowski 1997). It has been criticized by some for\nfailing to distinguish between capacities all or almost all human\nchildren have that are not also possessed by other creatures who feel\npleasure and pain. The third approach gives moral status to\nnon-paradigmatic children because of the interests others with moral\nstatus take in them (Sapontzis 1987), or the relationships they have\nwith them (Kittay 2005). Jaworska and Tannenbaum (2018) offer a\nmore recent version of such an account by arguing that children who\nare human and raised in a person-rearing manner have moral status.\n\nSometimes the approaches may be combined. For instance, Warren writes\nthat young children and other non-paradigmatic humans have moral\nstatus for two sorts of reasons: \u201ctheir rights are based not\nonly on the value which they themselves place upon their lives and\nwell-being, but also on the value which other human beings place on\nthem.\u201d (1992. 197) In addition to these three most common\napproaches, Mullin (2011) develops a fourth: some non-paradigmatic\nchildren (and adults) have moral status not simply because others\nvalue them but because they are themselves capable of being active\nparticipants in morally valuable relationships with others. These\nrelationships express care for others beyond their serving as means\nfor one\u2019s own satisfaction. Approaches to moral status that\nemphasize children\u2019s capacity to care for others in morally\nvaluable relationships also raise interesting questions about\nchildren\u2019s moral responsibilities within those relationships\n(see Mullin 2010).\n\nFor more on this topic see the entry on the\n grounds of moral status.\n9. Other Issues\n\nThe topics discussed above hardly exhaust the philosophy of childhood.\nThus, we have said nothing about, for example, philosophical\nliterature on personhood as it bears on questions about the morality\nof abortion, or bioethical discussions about when it is appropriate\nfor parents to consent to children\u2019s participation in medical\nresearch or refuse medical treatment of their children. There has been\nincreasing attention in recent years to questions about the\nappropriate limits of parental authority over children, about the\nsource and extent of parents and the state\u2019s responsibilities\nfor children, and about the moral permissibility of parents devoting\nsubstantial resources to advancing the life prospects of their\nchildren. These and many other topics concerning children may be\nfamiliar to philosophers as they get discussed in other contexts,\nparticularly within family ethics and bioethics. Discussing them under\nthe rubric, \u2018philosophy of childhood,\u2019 as well in the\nother contexts, may help us see connections between them and other\nphilosophical issues concerning children.\n",
