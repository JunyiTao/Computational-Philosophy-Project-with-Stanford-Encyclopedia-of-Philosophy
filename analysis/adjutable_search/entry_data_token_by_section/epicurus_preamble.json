    "main_text": "\n\nThe philosophy of Epicurus (341\u2013270 B.C.E.) was a complete and\ninterdependent system, involving a view of the goal of human life\n(happiness, resulting from absence of physical pain and mental\ndisturbance), an empiricist theory of knowledge (sensations, together\nwith the perception of pleasure and pain, are infallible criteria), a\ndescription of nature based on atomistic materialism, and a\nnaturalistic account of evolution, from the formation of the world to\nthe emergence of human societies. Epicurus believed that, on the basis\nof a radical materialism which dispensed with transcendent entities\nsuch as the Platonic Ideas or Forms, he could disprove the possibility\nof the soul\u2019s survival after death, and hence the prospect of\npunishment in the afterlife. He regarded the unacknowledged fear of\ndeath and punishment as the primary cause of anxiety among human\nbeings, and anxiety in turn as the source of extreme and irrational\ndesires. The elimination of the fears and corresponding desires would\nleave people free to pursue the pleasures, both physical and mental,\nto which they are naturally drawn, and to enjoy the peace of mind that\nis consequent upon their regularly expected and achieved satisfaction.\nIt remained to explain how irrational fears arose in the first place:\nhence the importance of an account of social evolution. Epicurus was\naware that deeply ingrained habits of thought are not easily\ncorrected, and thus he proposed various exercises to assist the\nnovice. His system included advice on the proper attitude toward\npolitics (avoid it where possible) and the gods (do not imagine that\nthey concern themselves about human beings and their behavior), the\nrole of sex (dubious), marriage (also dubious) and friendship\n(essential), reflections on the nature of various meteorological and\nplanetary phenomena, about which it was best to keep an open mind in\nthe absence of decisive verification, and explanations of such\nprocesses as gravity (that is, the tendency of objects to fall to the\nsurface of the earth) and magnetism, which posed considerable\nchallenges to the ingenuity of the earlier atomists. Although the\noverall structure of Epicureanism was designed to hang together and to\nserve its principal ethical goals, there was room for a great deal of\nintriguing philosophical argument concerning every aspect of the\nsystem, from the speed of atoms in a void to the origin of optical\nillusions.\n",
