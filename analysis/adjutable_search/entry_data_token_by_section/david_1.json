    "main_text": "Extant writings\n3. The Problem of Authorship\n\n\nWe do not know whether the texts transmitted under the name of\n\u2018David\u2019 were written at a time when Olympiodorus was still\nalive and active, or whether they date to the last decades of the 6th,\nbeginning of the 7th, centuries. The inability precisely to date these\ntexts compounds the difficulties that surround the attribution to a\nphilosopher named \u2018David\u2019. These difficulties are\nthreefold:\n\n First, in the Greek tradition, we nowhere find evidence of an\nAlexandrian philosopher named David; neither the Suda nor Hesychius\nnor Photius nor anyone else seems to know of any such person. Second,\nthe texts we have were evidently widely distributed and read, and an\nabbreviated and simplified version of the \u2018Prolegomena to\nPhilosophy\u2019 was translated at some point into Armenian (our\nearliest manuscripts date from the 14th century). The Armenian version\nwas given a new title and attributed to \u2018David, the\nInvincible\u2019, who, according to the Armenian tradition, however,\nwas a theologian of the 5th century. It is impossible to believe that\nthe Armenian theologian and the (Alexandrian) philosopher a century\nlater were one and the same.  There is also no reason to believe that\nthe latter David was of Armenian origin. Here, the cross-fertilization\nof intellectual traditions has given rise to a great deal of confusion\nwhich, in the absence of earlier manuscripts, is quite impossible to\nclear up completely.\n\n The third difficulty concerns the Greek manuscript tradition. All\nof our older manuscripts (from the 11th century onwards) are either\nanonymous or attribute their contents to (1) Elias, or to (2) the saint David\nof Thessaloniki (who died around 530), or (3) to the 10th century\nByzantine scholar Nicetas of Paphlagonia who called himself by the\nmonastic name \u2018David\u2019. Only the 16th century manuscripts\nand one from the 14th century name \u2018David\u2019 at all as\nauthor, and it seems imprudent to put too much, if any, weight on this\nattribution. It is quite possible that the texts we have now under the\nname of David first circulated as anonymous lecture notes and were\nonly later attributed to an author with a good Christian name so as to\nenhance its importance and authority among Christian readers.\n",
