    "main_text": "Philosophical Enterprise\n2. Philosophical Enterprise\n\n\nAn examination of Albert\u2019s published writings reveals something\nof his understanding of philosophy in human culture. In effect he\nprepared a kind of philosophical encyclopedia that occupied him up to\nthe last ten years of his life. He produced paraphrases of most of the\nworks of Aristotle available to him. In some cases where he felt that\nAristotle should have produced a work, but it was missing, Albert\nproduced the work himself. If he had produced nothing else it would be\nnecessary to say that he adopted the Aristotelian\nphilosophical-scientific program and subordinated it to the Neoplatonic tradition. Albert\u2019s\nintellectual vision, however, was very great. Not only did he\nparaphrase \u201cThe Philosopher\u201d (as the medievals called\nAristotle) but Porphyry, Boethius, Peter Lombard, Gilbert de la\nPorr\u00e9e, the Liber de causis, and Ps.-Dionysius. He\nalso wrote a number of commentaries on the Bible. In addition to all\nof this work of paraphrasing and commenting, in which Albert labored\nto prepare a kind of unified field theory of medieval Christian\nintellectual culture, he also wrote a number of works in which he\ndeveloped his own philosophical-scientific-theological vision. Here\none finds titles such as De unitate intellectus, \nProblemata determinate, De fato, \nDe XV problematibus, De natura boni, \nDe sacramentis, De incarnatione, \nDe bono, De quattuor coaequaevis, \nDe homine, and his unfinished \nSumma theologiae de mirabilis scientia Dei.\n\n\nAlbert\u2019s labors resulted in the formation of what might be\ncalled a Christian reception of Aristotle in the Western Europe.\nAlbert himself had a strong bias in favor of Neo-Platonism,and his\nwork on Aristotle shows him to have had a deep understanding of the\nAristotelian program. Along with his student Thomas Aquinas he was of\nthe opinion that Aristotle and the kind of natural philosophy that he\nrepresented was no obstacle to the development of a Christian\nphilosophical vision of the natural order. In order to establish this\npoint Albert carefully dissected the method that Aristotle employed in\nundertaking the task of expounding natural philosophy. This method,\nAlbert decided, is experientially based and proceeds to draw\nconclusions by the use of both inductive and deductive\nlogic. Christian theology, as Albert found it taught in Europe rested\nfirmly upon the revelation of Sacred Scripture and the Church\nFathers. Therefore, he reasoned, the two domains of human culture are\ndistinct in their methodology and pose no threat to each other. Both\ncan be pursued for their own sake. Philosophy was not to be valued\nonly in terms of its ancillary relation to theology. As recent\nresearch has shown, Albert subordinated his use of Aristotle to his\nunderstanding of the Neoplatonic view of reality that he found in the\nwritings of Pseudo Dionysius and the Liber de causis. He saw\nall of reality in terms of the Neoplatonic categories of exit and\nreturn, which he referred to in his writings with the terms\nexitus, perfectio, and reductio. This\nschema gave him a framework into which he could develop the scientific\ninsights of Aristotle. But within this framework he insisted that natural science must investigate the causes that are operating in nature as based on empirical evidence.\n",
