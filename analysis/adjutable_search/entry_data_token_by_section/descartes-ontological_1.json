    "main_text": "The Distinction between Essence and Existence\n2. The Distinction between Essence and Existence\n\n\nIn the Fifth Meditation and elsewhere Descartes says that God\u2019s\nexistence follows from the fact that existence is contained in the\n\u201ctrue and immutable essence, nature, or form\u201d of a\nsupremely perfect being, just as it follows from the essence of a\ntriangle that its angles equal two right angles. This way of putting\nthe a priori argument has puzzled commentators and has led to\na lively debate about the ontological status of Cartesian essences and\nthe objects which are purported to \u201chave\u201d them. Some\ncommentators have thought that Descartes is committed to a species of\nPlatonic realism.  According to this view, some objects that fall\nshort of actual existence nevertheless subsist as abstract, logical\nentities outside the mind and beyond the physical world (Kenny, 1968;\nWilson, 1978).  Another commentator places Cartesian essences in God\n(Schmaltz 1991), while two recent revisionist interpretations\n(Chappell, 1997; Nolan, 1997) read Descartes as a conceptualist who\ntakes essences to be ideas in human minds.\n\n\nDescartes\u2019 reference to \u201cessences\u201d raises another important issue\nmore directly related to the ontological argument. In claiming that\nnecessary existence cannot be excluded from the essence of God,\nDescartes is drawing on the traditional medieval distinction between\nessence and existence. According to this distinction, one can say\nwhat something is (i.e. its essence), prior to knowing whether\nit exists. So, for example, one can define what a horse is \u2014\nenumerating all of its essential properties \u2014 before knowing whether\nthere are any horses in the world. The only exception to this\ndistinction was thought to be God himself, whose essence just is to\nexist. It is easy to see how this traditional distinction could be\nexploited by a defender of the ontological argument. Existence is\nincluded in the essence of a supremely perfect being, but not in the\nessence of any finite thing. Thus it follows solely from the essence of\nthe former that such a being actually exists. At times, Descartes\nappears to support this interpretation of the ontological argument. In\nthe Fifth Replies, for example, he writes that \u201cthe existence of a\ntriangle should not be compared with the existence of God, since the\nrelation between existence and essence is manifestly quite different in\nthe case of God from what it is in the case of the triangle. God is his\nown existence, but this is not true of the triangle\u201d (AT 7:383; CSM\n2:263). But Descartes\u2019 complete view is subtler and more sophisticated\nthan these remarks first suggest. Understanding this view requires a\nmore careful investigation of the distinction between essence and\nexistence as it appears in medieval sources. Although one often speaks\nof the \u201ctraditional\u201d distinction, the exact nature of the relation\nbetween essence and existence in finite things was the subject of a\nfierce debate among medieval philosophers. Seeing where Descartes\u2019\nposition fits within this debate will provide a deeper understanding of\nhis version of the ontological argument.\n\n\nThe distinction between essence and existence can be traced back as\nfar as Boethius in the fifth century. It was later developed by\nIslamic thinkers such as Avicenna. But the issue did not become a\nmajor philosophical problem until it was taken up by Aquinas in the\nthirteenth century. The issue arose not as part of an effort to\nestablish God\u2019s existence on a priori grounds (as mentioned\nabove, Aquinas was one of the staunchest critics of the ontological\nargument), but out of concern to distinguish God from finite spiritual\nentities such as angels. Like many scholastic philosophers, Aquinas\nbelieved that God is perfectly simple and that created beings, in\ncontrast, have a composite character that accounts for their finitude\nand imperfection. Earthly creatures are composites of matter and form\n(the doctrine of hylomorphism), but since purely spiritual beings are\nimmaterial, Aquinas located their composite character in the\ndistinction between essence and existence.\n\n\nSome of the details of Aquinas\u2019 account will emerge from our\ndiscussion below. The primary interest of his theory for our purposes,\nhowever, is that it led to a lively debate among his successors both as\nto how to interpret the master and about the true nature of the\nrelation between essence and existence in created things. This debate\nproduced three main positions:\n\nThe Theory of Real Distinction\nThe Intermediate Position\nThe Theory of Rational Distinction\n\n\n\nProponents of the first view conceived the distinction between essence\nand existence as obtaining between two separate things. In the eyes of\nmany Thomists, this view was considered to be quite radical,\nespecially as an interpretation of Aquinas\u2019 original position. The\nlatter is sometimes expressed by saying that essence and existence are\n\u201cprinciples of being\u201d rather than beings themselves. One\nproblem then with the theory of real distinction, at least as espoused\nby many of Aquinas\u2019 followers, was that it reified essence and\nexistence, treating them as real beings in addition to the created\nentity that they compose.\n\n\nThe theory of real distinction was also considered objectionable for\nphilosophical reasons. Following Aquinas, many participants in the\ndebate urged that essence and existence are related to each other as\npotency and act, so that existence can be said to\n\u201cactualize\u201d essence.  On the theory of real distinction,\nthis view leads to an infinite regress. If an essence becomes actual\nonly in virtue of something else \u2014 viz. existence\n\u2014 being superadded to it, then what gives existence its reality,\nand so on ad infinitum? (Wippel, 1982, 393f).\n\n\nIn response to these difficulties some scholastic philosophers\ndeveloped a position at the polar extreme from the theory of real\ndistinction. This was the view that there is merely a rational\ndistinction or a \u201cdistinction of reason\u201d between essence\nand existence in created beings. As the term suggests, this theory\nheld that essence and existence of a creature are identical in reality\nand distinguished only within our thought by means of reason. Needless\nto say, proponents of this theory were forced to distinguish purely\nspiritual entities from God on grounds other than real\ncomposition.\n\n\nGiving up the doctrine of real composition seemed too much for another\ngroup of thinkers who were also critical of the theory of real\ndistinction. This led to the development of a number of intermediate\npositions, including Duns Scotus\u2019 curious notion of a formal\ndistinction and the view that essence and existence are modally\ndistinct such that existence constitutes a mode of a thing\u2019s\nessence.\n\n\nLike Francisco Su\u00e1rez, his most immediate scholastic\npredecessor, Descartes sides with the proponents of a rational\ndistinction between essence and existence. His position is unique,\nhowever, insofar as it springs from a more general theory of\n\u201cattributes\u201d. Articulating this theory in an important\npassage in the\nPrinciples of Philosophy, Descartes claims that there is\nmerely a distinction of reason between a substance and any one of its\nattributes or between any two attributes of a single substance (1:62,\nAT 8A:30; CSM 1:214). For Descartes\u2019 purposes, the most significant\ninstance of a rational distinction is that which obtains between a\nsubstance and its essence \u2014 or what he sometimes refers to as its\n\u201cprincipal attribute\u201d (1:53, AT 8A:25; CSM 1:210). Since thought and\nextension constitute the essence of mind and body, respectively, a mind\nis merely rationally distinct from its thinking and a body is merely\nrationally distinct from its extension (1:63, AT 8A:31; CSM 1:215). But\nDescartes insists that a rational distinction also obtains between any\ntwo attributes of a substance. Since existence qualifies as an\nattribute in this technical sense, the essence and existence of a\nsubstance are also distinct merely by reason (1:56, AT 8A:26; CSM\n1:211). Descartes reaffirms this conclusion in a letter intended to\nelucidate his account of the relation between essence and\nexistence:\n[4]\u2026 existence, duration, size, number and all\nuniversals are not, it seems to me, modes in the strict sense\n\u2026. They are referred to by a broader term and called attributes\n\u2026 because we do indeed understand the essence of a thing in one\nway when we consider it in abstraction from whether it exists or not,\nand in a different way when we consider it as existing; but the thing\nitself cannot be outside our thought without its existence\n\u2026. Accordingly I say that shape and other similar modes are\nstrictly speaking modally distinct from the substance whose modes they\nare; but there is a lesser distinction between the other attributes\n\u2026. I call it a rational distinction \u2026. (To an unknown\ncorrespondent, AT 4:349; CSMK 3:280)\n\n\nIndications are given here as to how a rational distinction is\nproduced in our thought. Descartes explains that we regard a single\nthing in different abstract ways. Case in point, we can regard a thing\nas existing, or we can abstract from its existence and attend to its\nother aspects. In so doing, we have distinguished the existence of a\nsubstance from its essence within our thought. Like scholastic\nproponents of the theory of rational distinction, however, Descartes\nis keen to emphasize that this distinction is purely\nconceptual. Indeed, he goes on to explain that the essence and\nexistence of a substance are \u201cin no way distinct\u201d outside\nthought (AT 4:350; CSMK 3:280). In reality they are identical.\n\n\nWhile borrowing much from scholasticism, Descartes\u2019 account is\ndistinguished by its scope of application. He extends the theory of\nrational distinction from created substances to God. In general, the\nessence and the existence of a substance are merely rationally\ndistinct, and hence identical in reality.\n\n\nThis result appears to wreak havoc on Descartes\u2019 ontological\nargument. One of the most important objections to the argument is that\nif it were valid, one could proliferate such arguments for all sorts of\nthings, including beings whose existence is merely contingent. By\nsupposing that there is merely a rational distinction between essence\nand existence abroad in all things, Descartes seems to confirm this\nobjection. In general, a substance is to be identified with its\nexistence, whether it is God or a finite created thing.\n\n\nThe problem with this objection, in this instance, is that it\nassumes that Descartes locates the difference between God and creatures\nin the relation each of these things bears to its existence. This is\nnot the case. In a few important passages, Descartes affirms that\nexistence is contained in the clear and distinct idea of every single\nthing, but he also insists that there are different grades of\nexistence:\n[5] Existence is contained in the idea or concept of every\nsingle thing, since we cannot conceive of anything except as existing.\nPossible or contingent existence is contained in the concept of a\nlimited thing, whereas necessary and perfect existence is contained in\nthe concept of a supremely perfect being (Axiom 10, Second Replies; AT\n7:166; CSM 2:117).\n\n\nIn light of this passage and others like it, we can refine the\ntheory of rational distinction. What one should say, strictly speaking,\nis that God is merely rationally distinct from his necessary\nexistence, while every finite created thing is merely rationally\ndistinct from its possible or contingent existence.\nThe distinction between possible or contingent existence on the one\nhand, and necessary existence on the other, allows Descartes to account\nfor the theological difference between God and his creatures.\n\n\nNow, when Descartes says that a substance (be it finite or infinite)\nis merely rationally distinct from its existence, he always means an\nactually existing substance. So how are we to understand the claim that\na finite substance is merely rationally distinct from its\npossible existence? What is meant by \u201cpossible (or contingent)\nexistence\u201d? It is tempting to suppose that this term means non-actual\nexistence. But as we saw already with the case of necessary existence,\nDescartes does not intend these terms in their logical or modal senses.\nIf \u201cnecessary existence\u201d means ontologically independent existence,\nthen \u201cpossible existence\u201d means something like dependent\nexistence. After all, Descartes contrasts possible existence not with\nactual existence but with necessary existence in the traditional sense.\nThis account is also suggested by the term \u201ccontingent.\u201d Created things\nare contingent in the sense that they depend for their existence on\nGod, the sole independent being.\n\n\nThis result explains why Descartes believes that we cannot\nproliferate ontological arguments for created substances. It is not\nthat the relation between essence and existence is any different in God\nthan it is in finite things. In both cases there is merely a rational\ndistinction. The difference is in the grade of existence that attaches\nto each. Whereas the concept of an independent being entails that such\na being exists, the concept of a finite thing entails only that it has\ndependent existence.\n\n\nLooking back at the problematic passage cited above from the Fifth\nReplies, it becomes clear that Descartes intended something along\nthese lines even there. He says that \u201cthe existence of a\ntriangle should not be compared with the existence of God\u201d,\nreinforcing the point that it is the kind of existence involved that\nmakes God unique. And just before this statement, he writes, \u201cin\nthe case of God necessary existence\u2026applies to him alone and\nforms a part of his essence as it does of no other thing\u201d. Later\nhe adds: \u201cI do not \u2026 deny that possible existence is a\nperfection in the idea of a triangle, just as necessary existence is\nperfection in the idea of God\u201d (AT 7:383; CSM 2:263). Descartes\u2019\nfinal position then is that essence and existence are identical in all\nthings. What distinguishes God from creatures is his grade of\nexistence. We can produce an ontological argument for God, and not for\nfinite substances, because the idea of a supremely perfect being\nuniquely contains necessary \u2014 or ontologically independent\n\u2014 existence.\n",
