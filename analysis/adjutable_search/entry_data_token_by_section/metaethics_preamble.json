    "main_text": "\n\nMetaethics is the attempt to understand the metaphysical,\nepistemological, semantic, and psychological, presuppositions and\ncommitments of moral thought, talk, and practice. As such, it counts\nwithin its domain a broad range of questions and puzzles, including:\nIs morality more a matter of taste than truth? Are moral standards\nculturally relative? Are there moral facts? If there are moral facts,\nwhat are their origin and nature? How is it that they set an\nappropriate standard for our behavior? How might moral facts be\nrelated to other facts (about psychology, happiness, human\nconventions\u2026)? And how do we learn about moral facts, if there\nare any? These questions lead naturally to puzzles about the meaning\nof moral claims as well as about moral truth and the justification of\nour moral commitments. Metaethics explores as well the connection\nbetween values, reasons for action, and human motivation, asking how\nit is that moral standards might provide us with reasons to do or\nrefrain from doing as they demand, and it addresses many of the issues\ncommonly bound up with the nature of freedom and its significance (or\nnot) for moral\n responsibility.[1]\n",
