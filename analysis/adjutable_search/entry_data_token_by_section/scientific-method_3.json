    "main_text": "Logic of method and critical responses || Logical constructionism and Operationalism\n3.1 Logical constructionism and Operationalism\n\nAdvances in logic and probability held out promise of the possibility\nof elaborate reconstructions of scientific theories and empirical\nmethod, the best example being Rudolf Carnap\u2019s The Logical\nStructure of the World (1928). Carnap attempted to show that a\nscientific theory could be reconstructed as a formal axiomatic\nsystem\u2014that is, a logic. That system could refer to the world\nbecause some of its basic sentences could be interpreted as\nobservations or operations which one could perform to test them. The\nrest of the theoretical system, including sentences using theoretical\nor unobservable terms (like electron or force) would then either be\nmeaningful because they could be reduced to observations, or they had\npurely logical meanings (called analytic, like mathematical\nidentities). This has been referred to as the verifiability criterion\nof meaning. According to the criterion, any statement not either\nanalytic or verifiable was strictly meaningless. Although the view was\nendorsed by Carnap in 1928, he would later come to see it as too\nrestrictive (Carnap 1956). Another familiar version of this idea is\noperationalism of Percy William Bridgman. In The Logic of Modern\nPhysics (1927) Bridgman asserted that every physical concept\ncould be defined in terms of the operations one would perform to\nverify the application of that concept. Making good on the\noperationalisation of a concept even as simple as length, however, can\neasily become enormously complex (for measuring very small lengths,\nfor instance) or impractical (measuring large distances like light\nyears.)\n\nCarl Hempel\u2019s (1950, 1951) criticisms of the verifiability\ncriterion of meaning had enormous influence. He pointed out that\nuniversal generalizations, such as most scientific laws, were not\nstrictly meaningful on the criterion. Verifiability and operationalism\nboth seemed too restrictive to capture standard scientific aims and\npractice. The tenuous connection between these reconstructions and\nactual scientific practice was criticized in another way. In both\napproaches, scientific methods are instead recast in methodological\nroles. Measurements, for example, were looked to as ways of giving\nmeanings to terms. The aim of the philosopher of science was not to\nunderstand the methods per se, but to use them to reconstruct\ntheories, their meanings, and their relation to the world. When\nscientists perform these operations, however, they will not report\nthat they are doing them to give meaning to terms in a formal\naxiomatic system. This disconnect between methodology and the details\nof actual scientific practice would seem to violate the empiricism the\nLogical Positivists and Bridgman were committed to. The view that\nmethodology should correspond to practice (to some extent) has been\ncalled historicism, or intuitionism. We turn to these criticisms and\nresponses in\n section 3.4.[4]\n\nPositivism also had to contend with the recognition that a purely\ninductivist approach, along the lines of Bacon-Newton-Mill, was\nuntenable. There was no pure observation, for starters. All\nobservation was theory laden. Theory is required to make any\nobservation, therefore not all theory can be derived from observation\nalone. (See the entry on\n theory and observation in science.)\n Even granting an observational basis, Hume had already pointed out\nthat one could not deductively justify inductive conclusions without\nbegging the question by presuming the success of the inductive method.\nLikewise, positivist attempts at analyzing how a generalization can be\nconfirmed by observations of its instances were subject to a number of\ncriticisms. Goodman (1965) and Hempel (1965) both point to paradoxes\ninherent in standard accounts of confirmation. Recent attempts at\nexplaining how observations can serve to confirm a scientific theory\nare discussed in\n section 4\n below.\n3.2. H-D as a logic of confirmation\n\nThe standard starting point for a non-inductive analysis of the logic\nof confirmation is known as the Hypothetico-Deductive (H-D) method. In\nits simplest form, a sentence of a theory which expresses some\nhypothesis is confirmed by its true consequences. As noted in\n section 2,\n this method had been advanced by Whewell in the 19th\ncentury, as well as Nicod (1924) and others in the 20th\ncentury. Often, Hempel\u2019s (1966) description of the H-D method,\nillustrated by the case of Semmelweiss\u2019 inferential procedures\nin establishing the cause of childbed fever, has been presented as a\nkey account of H-D as well as a foil for criticism of the H-D account\nof confirmation (see, for example, Lipton\u2019s (2004) discussion of\ninference to the best explanation; also the entry on\n confirmation).\n Hempel described Semmelsweiss\u2019 procedure as examining various\nhypotheses explaining the cause of childbed fever. Some hypotheses\nconflicted with observable facts and could be rejected as false\nimmediately. Others needed to be tested experimentally by deducing\nwhich observable events should follow if the hypothesis were true\n(what Hempel called the test implications of the hypothesis), then\nconducting an experiment and observing whether or not the test\nimplications occurred. If the experiment showed the test implication\nto be false, the hypothesis could be rejected. If the experiment\nshowed the test implications to be true, however, this did not prove\nthe hypothesis true. The confirmation of a test implication does not\nverify a hypothesis, though Hempel did allow that \u201cit provides\nat least some support, some corroboration or confirmation for\nit\u201d (Hempel 1966: 8). The degree of this support then depends on\nthe quantity, variety and precision of the supporting evidence.\n3.3. Popper and falsificationism\n\nAnother approach that took off from the difficulties with inductive\ninference was\n Karl Popper\u2019s\n critical rationalism or falsificationism (Popper 1959, 1963).\nFalsification is deductive and similar to H-D in that it involves\nscientists deducing observational consequences from the hypothesis\nunder test. For Popper, however, the important point was not the\ndegree of confirmation that successful prediction offered to a\nhypothesis. The crucial thing was the logical asymmetry between\nconfirmation, based on inductive inference, and falsification, which\ncan be based on a deductive inference. (This simple opposition was\nlater questioned, by Lakatos, among others. See the entry on\n historicist theories of scientific rationality.)\n\nPopper stressed that, regardless of the amount of confirming evidence,\nwe can never be certain that a hypothesis is true without committing\nthe fallacy of affirming the consequent. Instead, Popper introduced\nthe notion of corroboration as a measure for how well a theory or\nhypothesis has survived previous testing\u2014but without implying\nthat this is also a measure for the probability that it is true.\n\nPopper was also motivated by his doubts about the scientific status of\ntheories like the Marxist theory of history or psycho-analysis, and so\nwanted to demarcate between science and pseudo-science. Popper saw\nthis as an importantly different distinction than demarcating science\nfrom metaphysics. The latter demarcation was the primary concern of\nmany logical empiricists. Popper used the idea of falsification to\ndraw a line instead between pseudo and proper science. Science was\nscience because its method involved subjecting theories to rigorous\ntests which offered a high probability of failing and thus refuting\nthe theory.\n\nA commitment to the risk of failure was important. Avoiding\nfalsification could be done all too easily. If a consequence of a\ntheory is inconsistent with observations, an exception can be added by\nintroducing auxiliary hypotheses designed explicitly to save the\ntheory, so-called ad hoc modifications. This Popper saw done\nin pseudo-science where ad hoc theories appeared capable of explaining\nanything in their field of application. In contrast, science is risky.\nIf observations showed the predictions from a theory to be wrong, the\ntheory would be refuted. Hence, scientific hypotheses must be\nfalsifiable. Not only must there exist some possible observation\nstatement which could falsify the hypothesis or theory, were it\nobserved, (Popper called these the hypothesis\u2019 potential\nfalsifiers) it is crucial to the Popperian scientific method that such\nfalsifications be sincerely attempted on a regular basis.\n\nThe more potential falsifiers of a hypothesis, the more falsifiable it\nwould be, and the more the hypothesis claimed. Conversely, hypotheses\nwithout falsifiers claimed very little or nothing at all. Originally,\nPopper thought that this meant the introduction of ad hoc\nhypotheses only to save a theory should not be countenanced as good\nscientific method. These would undermine the falsifiabililty of a\ntheory. However, Popper later came to recognize that the introduction\nof modifications (immunizations, he called them) was often an\nimportant part of scientific development. Responding to surprising or\napparently falsifying observations often generated important new\nscientific insights. Popper\u2019s own example was the observed\nmotion of Uranus which originally did not agree with Newtonian\npredictions. The ad hoc hypothesis of an outer planet\nexplained the disagreement and led to further falsifiable predictions.\nPopper sought to reconcile the view by blurring the distinction\nbetween falsifiable and not falsifiable, and speaking instead of\ndegrees of testability (Popper 1985: 41f.).\n3.4 Meta-methodology and the end of method\n\nFrom the 1960s on, sustained meta-methodological criticism emerged\nthat drove philosophical focus away from scientific method. A brief\nlook at those criticisms follows, with recommendations for further\nreading at the end of the entry.\n\nThomas Kuhn\u2019s The Structure of Scientific Revolutions\n(1962) begins with a well-known shot across the bow for philosophers\nof science:\n\n\nHistory, if viewed as a repository for more than anecdote or\nchronology, could produce a decisive transformation in the image of\nscience by which we are now possessed. (1962: 1)\n\n\nThe image Kuhn thought needed transforming was the a-historical,\nrational reconstruction sought by many of the Logical Positivists,\nthough Carnap and other positivists were actually quite sympathetic to\nKuhn\u2019s views. (See the entry on the\n Vienna Circle.)\n Kuhn shares with other of his contemporaries, such as Feyerabend and\nLakatos, a commitment to a more empirical approach to philosophy of\nscience. Namely, the history of science provides important data, and\nnecessary checks, for philosophy of science, including any theory of\nscientific method.\n\nThe history of science reveals, according to Kuhn, that scientific\ndevelopment occurs in alternating phases. During normal science, the\nmembers of the scientific community adhere to the paradigm in place.\nTheir commitment to the paradigm means a commitment to the puzzles to\nbe solved and the acceptable ways of solving them. Confidence in the\nparadigm remains so long as steady progress is made in solving the\nshared puzzles. Method in this normal phase operates within a\ndisciplinary matrix (Kuhn\u2019s later concept of a paradigm) which\nincludes standards for problem solving, and defines the range of\nproblems to which the method should be applied. An important part of a\ndisciplinary matrix is the set of values which provide the norms and\naims for scientific method. The main values that Kuhn identifies are\nprediction, problem solving, simplicity, consistency, and\nplausibility.\n\nAn important by-product of normal science is the accumulation of\npuzzles which cannot be solved with resources of the current paradigm.\nOnce accumulation of these anomalies has reached some critical mass,\nit can trigger a communal shift to a new paradigm and a new phase of\nnormal science. Importantly, the values that provide the norms and\naims for scientific method may have transformed in the meantime.\nMethod may therefore be relative to discipline, time or place\n\nFeyerabend also identified the aims of science as progress, but argued\nthat any methodological prescription would only stifle that progress\n(Feyerabend 1988). His arguments are grounded in re-examining accepted\n\u201cmyths\u201d about the history of science. Heroes of science,\nlike Galileo, are shown to be just as reliant on rhetoric and\npersuasion as they are on reason and demonstration. Others, like\nAristotle, are shown to be far more reasonable and far-reaching in\ntheir outlooks then they are given credit for. As a consequence, the\nonly rule that could provide what he took to be sufficient freedom was\nthe vacuous \u201canything goes\u201d. More generally, even the\nmethodological restriction that science is the best way to pursue\nknowledge, and to increase knowledge, is too restrictive. Feyerabend\nsuggested instead that science might, in fact, be a threat to a free\nsociety, because it and its myth had become so dominant (Feyerabend\n1978).\n\nAn even more fundamental kind of criticism was offered by several\nsociologists of science from the 1970s onwards who rejected the\nmethodology of providing philosophical accounts for the rational\ndevelopment of science and sociological accounts of the irrational\nmistakes. Instead, they adhered to a symmetry thesis on which any\ncausal explanation of how scientific knowledge is established needs to\nbe symmetrical in explaining truth and falsity, rationality and\nirrationality, success and mistakes, by the same causal factors (see,\ne.g., Barnes and Bloor 1982, Bloor 1991). Movements in the Sociology\nof Science, like the Strong Programme, or in the social dimensions and\ncauses of knowledge more generally led to extended and close\nexamination of detailed case studies in contemporary science and its\nhistory. (See the entries on\n the social dimensions of scientific knowledge\n and\n social epistemology.)\n Well-known examinations by Latour and Woolgar (1979/1986),\nKnorr-Cetina (1981), Pickering (1984), Shapin and Schaffer (1985) seem\nto bear out that it was social ideologies (on a macro-scale) or\nindividual interactions and circumstances (on a micro-scale) which\nwere the primary causal factors in determining which beliefs gained\nthe status of scientific knowledge. As they saw it therefore,\nexplanatory appeals to scientific method were not empirically\ngrounded.\n\nA late, and largely unexpected, criticism of scientific method came\nfrom within science itself. Beginning in the early 2000s, a number of\nscientists attempting to replicate the results of published\nexperiments could not do so. There may be close conceptual connection\nbetween reproducibility and method. For example, if reproducibility\nmeans that the same scientific methods ought to produce the same\nresult, and all scientific results ought to be reproducible, then\nwhatever it takes to reproduce a scientific result ought to be called\nscientific method. Space limits us to the observation that, insofar as\nreproducibility is a desired outcome of proper scientific method, it\nis not strictly a part of scientific method. (See the entry on\n reproducibility of scientific results.)\n\nBy the close of the 20th century the search for the\nscientific method was flagging. Nola and Sankey (2000b) could\nintroduce their volume on method by remarking that \u201cFor some,\nthe whole idea of a theory of scientific method is yester-year\u2019s\ndebate \u2026\u201d.\n4. Statistical methods for hypothesis testing\n\nDespite the many difficulties that philosophers encountered in trying\nto providing a clear methodology of conformation (or refutation),\nstill important progress has been made on understanding how\nobservation can provide evidence for a given theory. Work in\nstatistics has been crucial for understanding how theories can be\ntested empirically, and in recent decades a huge literature has\ndeveloped that attempts to recast confirmation in Bayesian terms. Here\nthese developments can be covered only briefly, and we refer to the\nentry on\n confirmation\n for further details and references.\n\nStatistics has come to play an increasingly important role in the\nmethodology of the experimental sciences from the 19th\ncentury onwards. At that time, statistics and probability theory took\non a methodological role as an analysis of inductive inference, and\nattempts to ground the rationality of induction in the axioms of\nprobability theory have continued throughout the 20th\ncentury and in to the present. Developments in the theory of\nstatistics itself, meanwhile, have had a direct and immense influence\non the experimental method, including methods for measuring the\nuncertainty of observations such as the Method of Least Squares\ndeveloped by Legendre and Gauss in the early 19th century,\ncriteria for the rejection of outliers proposed by Peirce by the\nmid-19th century, and the significance tests developed by\nGosset (a.k.a. \u201cStudent\u201d), Fisher, Neyman & Pearson\nand others in the 1920s and 1930s (see, e.g., Swijtink 1987 for a\nbrief historical overview; and also the entry on\n C.S. Peirce).\n\nThese developments within statistics then in turn led to a reflective\ndiscussion among both statisticians and philosophers of science on how\nto perceive the process of hypothesis testing: whether it was a\nrigorous statistical inference that could provide a numerical\nexpression of the degree of confidence in the tested hypothesis, or if\nit should be seen as a decision between different courses of actions\nthat also involved a value component. This led to a major controversy\namong Fisher on the one side and Neyman and Pearson on the other (see\nespecially Fisher 1955, Neyman 1956 and Pearson 1955, and for analyses\nof the controversy, e.g., Howie 2002, Marks 2000, Lenhard 2006). On\nFisher\u2019s view, hypothesis testing was a methodology for when to\naccept or reject a statistical hypothesis, namely that a hypothesis\nshould be rejected by evidence if this evidence would be unlikely\nrelative to other possible outcomes, given the hypothesis were true.\nIn contrast, on Neyman and Pearson\u2019s view, the consequence of\nerror also had to play a role when deciding between hypotheses.\nIntroducing the distinction between the error of rejecting a true\nhypothesis (type I error) and accepting a false hypothesis (type II\nerror), they argued that it depends on the consequences of the error\nto decide whether it is more important to avoid rejecting a true\nhypothesis or accepting a false one. Hence, Fisher aimed for a theory\nof inductive inference that enabled a numerical expression of\nconfidence in a hypothesis. To him, the important point was the search\nfor truth, not utility. In contrast, the Neyman-Pearson approach\nprovided a strategy of inductive behaviour for deciding between\ndifferent courses of action. Here, the important point was not whether\na hypothesis was true, but whether one should act as if it was.\n\nSimilar discussions are found in the philosophical literature. On the\none side, Churchman (1948) and Rudner (1953) argued that because\nscientific hypotheses can never be completely verified, a complete\nanalysis of the methods of scientific inference includes ethical\njudgments in which the scientists must decide whether the evidence is\nsufficiently strong or that the probability is sufficiently high to\nwarrant the acceptance of the hypothesis, which again will depend on\nthe importance of making a mistake in accepting or rejecting the\nhypothesis. Others, such as Jeffrey (1956) and Levi (1960) disagreed\nand instead defended a value-neutral view of science on which\nscientists should bracket their attitudes, preferences, temperament,\nand values when assessing the correctness of their inferences. For\nmore details on this value-free ideal in the philosophy of science and\nits historical development, see Douglas (2009) and Howard (2003). For\na broad set of case studies examining the role of values in science,\nsee e.g. Elliott & Richards 2017.\n\nIn recent decades, philosophical discussions of the evaluation of\nprobabilistic hypotheses by statistical inference have largely focused\non Bayesianism that understands probability as a measure of a\nperson\u2019s degree of belief in an event, given the available\ninformation, and frequentism that instead understands probability as a\nlong-run frequency of a repeatable event. Hence, for Bayesians\nprobabilities refer to a state of knowledge, whereas for frequentists\nprobabilities refer to frequencies of events (see, e.g., Sober 2008,\nchapter 1 for a detailed introduction to Bayesianism and frequentism\nas well as to likelihoodism). Bayesianism aims at providing a\nquantifiable, algorithmic representation of belief revision, where\nbelief revision is a function of prior beliefs (i.e., background\nknowledge) and incoming evidence. Bayesianism employs a rule based on\nBayes\u2019 theorem, a theorem of the probability calculus which\nrelates conditional probabilities. The probability that a particular\nhypothesis is true is interpreted as a degree of belief, or credence,\nof the scientist. There will also be a probability and a degree of\nbelief that a hypothesis will be true conditional on a piece of\nevidence (an observation, say) being true. Bayesianism proscribes that\nit is rational for the scientist to update their belief in the\nhypothesis to that conditional probability should it turn out that the\nevidence is, in fact, observed (see, e.g., Sprenger & Hartmann\n2019 for a comprehensive treatment of Bayesian philosophy of science).\nOriginating in the work of Neyman and Person, frequentism aims at\nproviding the tools for reducing long-run error rates, such as the\nerror-statistical approach developed by Mayo (1996) that focuses on\nhow experimenters can avoid both type I and type II errors by building\nup a repertoire of procedures that detect errors if and only if they\nare present. Both Bayesianism and frequentism have developed over\ntime, they are interpreted in different ways by its various\nproponents, and their relations to previous criticism to attempts at\ndefining scientific method are seen differently by proponents and\ncritics. The literature, surveys, reviews and criticism in this area\nare vast and the reader is referred to the entries on\n Bayesian epistemology\n and\n confirmation.\n5. Method in Practice\n\nAttention to scientific practice, as we have seen, is not itself new.\nHowever, the turn to practice in the philosophy of science of late can\nbe seen as a correction to the pessimism with respect to method in\nphilosophy of science in later parts of the 20th century,\nand as an attempted reconciliation between sociological and\nrationalist explanations of scientific knowledge. Much of this work\nsees method as detailed and context specific problem-solving\nprocedures, and methodological analyses to be at the same time\ndescriptive, critical and advisory (see Nickles 1987 for an exposition\nof this view). The following section contains a survey of some of the\npractice focuses. In this section we turn fully to topics rather than\nchronology.\n5.1 Creative and exploratory practices\n\nA problem with the distinction between the contexts of discovery and\njustification that figured so prominently in philosophy of science in\nthe first half of the 20th century (see\n section 2)\n is that no such distinction can be clearly seen in scientific\nactivity (see Arabatzis 2006). Thus, in recent decades, it has been\nrecognized that study of conceptual innovation and change should not\nbe confined to psychology and sociology of science, but are also\nimportant aspects of scientific practice which philosophy of science\nshould address (see also the entry on\n scientific discovery).\n Looking for the practices that drive conceptual innovation has led\nphilosophers to examine both the reasoning practices of scientists and\nthe wide realm of experimental practices that are not directed\nnarrowly at testing hypotheses, that is, exploratory\nexperimentation.\n\nExamining the reasoning practices of historical and contemporary\nscientists, Nersessian (2008) has argued that new scientific concepts\nare constructed as solutions to specific problems by systematic\nreasoning, and that of analogy, visual representation and\nthought-experimentation are among the important reasoning practices\nemployed. These ubiquitous forms of reasoning are reliable\u2014but\nalso fallible\u2014methods of conceptual development and change. On\nher account, model-based reasoning consists of cycles of construction,\nsimulation, evaluation and adaption of models that serve as interim\ninterpretations of the target problem to be solved. Often, this\nprocess will lead to modifications or extensions, and a new cycle of\nsimulation and evaluation. However, Nersessian also emphasizes\nthat\n\n\ncreative model-based reasoning cannot be applied as a simple recipe,\nis not always productive of solutions, and even its most exemplary\nusages can lead to incorrect solutions. (Nersessian 2008: 11)\n\n\nThus, while on the one hand she agrees with many previous philosophers\nthat there is no logic of discovery, discoveries can derive from\nreasoned processes, such that a large and integral part of scientific\npractice is\n\n\nthe creation of concepts through which to comprehend, structure, and\ncommunicate about physical phenomena \u2026. (Nersessian 1987:\n11)\n\n\nSimilarly, work on heuristics for discovery and theory construction by\nscholars such as Darden (1991) and Bechtel & Richardson (1993)\npresent science as problem solving and investigate scientific problem\nsolving as a special case of problem-solving in general. Drawing\nlargely on cases from the biological sciences, much of their focus has\nbeen on reasoning strategies for the generation, evaluation, and\nrevision of mechanistic explanations of complex systems.\n\nAddressing another aspect of the context distinction, namely the\ntraditional view that the primary role of experiments is to test\ntheoretical hypotheses according to the H-D model, other philosophers\nof science have argued for additional roles that experiments can play.\nThe notion of exploratory experimentation was introduced to describe\nexperiments driven by the desire to obtain empirical regularities and\nto develop concepts and classifications in which these regularities\ncan be described (Steinle 1997, 2002; Burian 1997; Waters 2007)).\nHowever the difference between theory driven experimentation and\nexploratory experimentation should not be seen as a sharp distinction.\nTheory driven experiments are not always directed at testing\nhypothesis, but may also be directed at various kinds of\nfact-gathering, such as determining numerical parameters. Vice\nversa, exploratory experiments are usually informed by theory in\nvarious ways and are therefore not theory-free. Instead, in\nexploratory experiments phenomena are investigated without first\nlimiting the possible outcomes of the experiment on the basis of\nextant theory about the phenomena.\n\nThe development of high throughput instrumentation in molecular\nbiology and neighbouring fields has given rise to a special type of\nexploratory experimentation that collects and analyses very large\namounts of data, and these new \u2018omics\u2019 disciplines are\noften said to represent a break with the ideal of hypothesis-driven\nscience (Burian 2007; Elliott 2007; Waters 2007; O\u2019Malley 2007)\nand instead described as data-driven research (Leonelli 2012; Strasser\n2012) or as a special kind of \u201cconvenience\nexperimentation\u201d in which many experiments are done simply\nbecause they are extraordinarily convenient to perform (Krohs\n2012).\n5.2 Computer methods and \u2018new ways\u2019 of doing science\n\nThe field of omics just described is possible because of the ability\nof computers to process, in a reasonable amount of time, the huge\nquantities of data required. Computers allow for more elaborate\nexperimentation (higher speed, better filtering, more variables,\nsophisticated coordination and control), but also, through modelling\nand simulations, might constitute a form of experimentation\nthemselves. Here, too, we can pose a version of the general question\nof method versus practice: does the practice of using computers\nfundamentally change scientific method, or merely provide a more\nefficient means of implementing standard methods?\n\nBecause computers can be used to automate measurements,\nquantifications, calculations, and statistical analyses where, for\npractical reasons, these operations cannot be otherwise carried out,\nmany of the steps involved in reaching a conclusion on the basis of an\nexperiment are now made inside a \u201cblack box\u201d, without the\ndirect involvement or awareness of a human. This has epistemological\nimplications, regarding what we can know, and how we can know it. To\nhave confidence in the results, computer methods are therefore\nsubjected to tests of verification and validation.\n\nThe distinction between verification and validation is easiest to\ncharacterize in the case of computer simulations. In a typical\ncomputer simulation scenario computers are used to numerically\nintegrate differential equations for which no analytic solution is\navailable. The equations are part of the model the scientist uses to\nrepresent a phenomenon or system under investigation. Verifying a\ncomputer simulation means checking that the equations of the model are\nbeing correctly approximated. Validating a simulation means checking\nthat the equations of the model are adequate for the inferences one\nwants to make on the basis of that model.\n\nA number of issues related to computer simulations have been raised.\nThe identification of validity and verification as the testing methods\nhas been criticized. Oreskes et al. (1994) raise concerns that\n\u201cvalidiation\u201d, because it suggests deductive inference,\nmight lead to over-confidence in the results of simulations. The\ndistinction itself is probably too clean, since actual practice in the\ntesting of simulations mixes and moves back and forth between the two\n(Weissart 1997; Parker 2008a; Winsberg 2010). Computer simulations do\nseem to have a non-inductive character, given that the principles by\nwhich they operate are built in by the programmers, and any results of\nthe simulation follow from those in-built principles in such a way\nthat those results could, in principle, be deduced from the program\ncode and its inputs. The status of simulations as experiments has\ntherefore been examined (Kaufmann and Smarr 1993; Humphreys 1995;\nHughes 1999; Norton and Suppe 2001). This literature considers the\nepistemology of these experiments: what we can learn by simulation,\nand also the kinds of justifications which can be given in applying\nthat knowledge to the \u201creal\u201d world. (Mayo 1996; Parker\n2008b). As pointed out, part of the advantage of computer simulation\nderives from the fact that huge numbers of calculations can be carried\nout without requiring direct observation by the\nexperimenter/\u200bsimulator. At the same time, many of these\ncalculations are approximations to the calculations which would be\nperformed first-hand in an ideal situation. Both factors introduce\nuncertainties into the inferences drawn from what is observed in the\nsimulation.\n\nFor many of the reasons described above, computer simulations do not\nseem to belong clearly to either the experimental or theoretical\ndomain. Rather, they seem to crucially involve aspects of both. This\nhas led some authors, such as Fox Keller (2003: 200) to argue that we\nought to consider computer simulation a \u201cqualitatively different\nway of doing science\u201d. The literature in general tends to follow\nKaufmann and Smarr (1993) in referring to computer simulation as a\n\u201cthird way\u201d for scientific methodology (theoretical\nreasoning and experimental practice are the first two ways.). It\nshould also be noted that the debates around these issues have tended\nto focus on the form of computer simulation typical in the physical\nsciences, where models are based on dynamical equations. Other forms\nof simulation might not have the same problems, or have problems of\ntheir own (see the entry on\n computer simulations in science).\n\nIn recent years, the rapid development of machine learning techniques\nhas prompted some scholars to suggest that the scientific method has\nbecome \u201cobsolete\u201d (Anderson 2008, Carrol and Goodstein\n2009). This has resulted in an intense debate on the relative merit of\ndata-driven and hypothesis-driven research (for samples, see e.g.\nMazzocchi 2015 or Succi and Coveney 2018). For a detailed treatment of\nthis topic, we refer to the entry\n scientific research and big data.\n6. Discourse on scientific method\n\nDespite philosophical disagreements, the idea of the\nscientific method still figures prominently in contemporary discourse\non many different topics, both within science and in society at large.\nOften, reference to scientific method is used in ways that convey\neither the legend of a single, universal method characteristic of all\nscience, or grants to a particular method or set of methods privilege\nas a special \u2018gold standard\u2019, often with reference to\nparticular philosophers to vindicate the claims. Discourse on\nscientific method also typically arises when there is a need to\ndistinguish between science and other activities, or for justifying\nthe special status conveyed to science. In these areas, the\nphilosophical attempts at identifying a set of methods characteristic\nfor scientific endeavors are closely related to the philosophy of\nscience\u2019s classical problem of demarcation (see the entry on\n science and pseudo-science)\n and to the philosophical analysis of the social dimension of\nscientific knowledge and the role of science in democratic\nsociety.\n6.1 \u201cThe scientific method\u201d in science education and as seen by scientists\n\nOne of the settings in which the legend of a single, universal\nscientific method has been particularly strong is science education\n(see, e.g., Bauer 1992; McComas 1996; Wivagg & Allchin\n 2002).[5]\n Often, \u2018the scientific method\u2019 is presented in textbooks\nand educational web pages as a fixed four or five step procedure\nstarting from observations and description of a phenomenon and\nprogressing over formulation of a hypothesis which explains the\nphenomenon, designing and conducting experiments to test the\nhypothesis, analyzing the results, and ending with drawing a\nconclusion. Such references to a universal scientific method can be\nfound in educational material at all levels of science education\n(Blachowicz 2009), and numerous studies have shown that the idea of a\ngeneral and universal scientific method often form part of both\nstudents\u2019 and teachers\u2019 conception of science (see, e.g.,\nAikenhead 1987; Osborne et al. 2003). In response, it has been argued\nthat science education need to focus more on teaching about the nature\nof science, although views have differed on whether this is best done\nthrough student-led investigations, contemporary cases, or historical\ncases (Allchin, Andersen & Nielsen 2014)\n\nAlthough occasionally phrased with reference to the H-D method,\nimportant historical roots of the legend in science education of a\nsingle, universal scientific method are the American philosopher and\npsychologist Dewey\u2019s account of inquiry in How We Think\n(1910) and the British mathematician Karl Pearson\u2019s account of\nscience in Grammar of Science (1892). On Dewey\u2019s\naccount, inquiry is divided into the five steps of\n\n\n(i) a felt difficulty, (ii) its location and definition, (iii)\nsuggestion of a possible solution, (iv) development by reasoning of\nthe bearing of the suggestions, (v) further observation and experiment\nleading to its acceptance or rejection. (Dewey 1910: 72)\n\n\nSimilarly, on Pearson\u2019s account, scientific investigations start\nwith measurement of data and observation of their correction and\nsequence from which scientific laws can be discovered with the aid of\ncreative imagination. These laws have to be subject to criticism, and\ntheir final acceptance will have equal validity for \u201call\nnormally constituted minds\u201d. Both Dewey\u2019s and\nPearson\u2019s accounts should be seen as generalized abstractions of\ninquiry and not restricted to the realm of science\u2014although both\nDewey and Pearson referred to their respective accounts as \u2018the\nscientific method\u2019.\n\nOccasionally, scientists make sweeping statements about a simple and\ndistinct scientific method, as exemplified by Feynman\u2019s\nsimplified version of a conjectures and refutations method presented,\nfor example, in the last of his 1964 Cornell Messenger\n lectures.[6]\n However, just as often scientists have come to the same conclusion as\nrecent philosophy of science that there is not any unique, easily\ndescribed scientific method. For example, the physicist and Nobel\nLaureate Weinberg described in the paper \u201cThe Methods of Science\n\u2026 And Those By Which We Live\u201d (1995) how\n\n\nThe fact that the standards of scientific success shift with time does\nnot only make the philosophy of science difficult; it also raises\nproblems for the public understanding of science. We do not have a\nfixed scientific method to rally around and defend. (1995: 8)\n\n\nInterview studies with scientists on their conception of method shows\nthat scientists often find it hard to figure out whether available\nevidence confirms their hypothesis, and that there are no direct\ntranslations between general ideas about method and specific\nstrategies to guide how research is conducted (Schickore & Hangel\n2019, Hangel & Schickore 2017)\n6.2 Privileged methods and \u2018gold standards\u2019\n\nReference to the scientific method has also often been used to argue\nfor the scientific nature or special status of a particular activity.\nPhilosophical positions that argue for a simple and unique scientific\nmethod as a criterion of demarcation, such as Popperian falsification,\nhave often attracted practitioners who felt that they had a need to\ndefend their domain of practice. For example, references to\nconjectures and refutation as the scientific method are abundant in\nmuch of the literature on complementary and alternative medicine\n(CAM)\u2014alongside the competing position that CAM, as an\nalternative to conventional biomedicine, needs to develop its own\nmethodology different from that of science.\n\nAlso within mainstream science, reference to the scientific method is\nused in arguments regarding the internal hierarchy of disciplines and\ndomains. A frequently seen argument is that research based on the H-D\nmethod is superior to research based on induction from observations\nbecause in deductive inferences the conclusion follows necessarily\nfrom the premises. (See, e.g., Parascandola 1998 for an analysis of\nhow this argument has been made to downgrade epidemiology compared to\nthe laboratory sciences.) Similarly, based on an examination of the\npractices of major funding institutions such as the National\nInstitutes of Health (NIH), the National Science Foundation (NSF) and\nthe Biomedical Sciences Research Practices (BBSRC) in the UK,\nO\u2019Malley et al. (2009) have argued that funding agencies seem to\nhave a tendency to adhere to the view that the primary activity of\nscience is to test hypotheses, while descriptive and exploratory\nresearch is seen as merely preparatory activities that are valuable\nonly insofar as they fuel hypothesis-driven research.\n\nIn some areas of science, scholarly publications are structured in a\nway that may convey the impression of a neat and linear process of\ninquiry from stating a question, devising the methods by which to\nanswer it, collecting the data, to drawing a conclusion from the\nanalysis of data. For example, the codified format of publications in\nmost biomedical journals known as the IMRAD format (Introduction,\nMethod, Results, Analysis, Discussion) is explicitly described by the\njournal editors as \u201cnot an arbitrary publication format but\nrather a direct reflection of the process of scientific\ndiscovery\u201d (see the so-called \u201cVancouver\nRecommendations\u201d, ICMJE 2013: 11). However, scientific\npublications do not in general reflect the process by which the\nreported scientific results were produced. For example, under the\nprovocative title \u201cIs the scientific paper a fraud?\u201d,\nMedawar argued that scientific papers generally misrepresent how the\nresults have been produced (Medawar 1963/1996). Similar views have\nbeen advanced by philosophers, historians and sociologists of science\n(Gilbert 1976; Holmes 1987; Knorr-Cetina 1981; Schickore 2008; Suppe\n1998) who have argued that scientists\u2019 experimental practices\nare messy and often do not follow any recognizable pattern.\nPublications of research results, they argue, are retrospective\nreconstructions of these activities that often do not preserve the\ntemporal order or the logic of these activities, but are instead often\nconstructed in order to screen off potential criticism (see Schickore\n2008 for a review of this work).\n6.3 Scientific method in the court room\n\nPhilosophical positions on the scientific method have also made it\ninto the court room, especially in the US where judges have drawn on\nphilosophy of science in deciding when to confer special status to\nscientific expert testimony. A key case is Daubert vs Merrell Dow\nPharmaceuticals (92\u2013102, 509 U.S. 579, 1993). In this case,\nthe Supreme Court argued in its 1993 ruling that trial judges must\nensure that expert testimony is reliable, and that in doing this the\ncourt must look at the expert\u2019s methodology to determine whether\nthe proffered evidence is actually scientific knowledge. Further,\nreferring to works of Popper and Hempel the court stated that\n\n\nordinarily, a key question to be answered in determining whether a\ntheory or technique is scientific knowledge \u2026 is whether it can\nbe (and has been) tested. (Justice Blackmun, Daubert v. Merrell Dow\nPharmaceuticals; see Other Internet Resources for a link to the\nopinion)\n\n\nBut as argued by Haack (2005a,b, 2010) and by Foster & Hubner\n(1999), by equating the question of whether a piece of testimony is\nreliable with the question whether it is scientific as indicated by a\nspecial methodology, the court was producing an inconsistent mixture\nof Popper\u2019s and Hempel\u2019s philosophies, and this has later\nled to considerable confusion in subsequent case rulings that drew on\nthe Daubert case (see Haack 2010 for a detailed exposition).\n6.4 Deviating practices\n\nThe difficulties around identifying the methods of science are also\nreflected in the difficulties of identifying scientific misconduct in\nthe form of improper application of the method or methods of science.\nOne of the first and most influential attempts at defining misconduct\nin science was the US definition from 1989 that defined misconduct\nas\n\n\nfabrication, falsification, plagiarism, or other practices that\nseriously deviate from those that are commonly accepted within the\nscientific community. (Code of Federal Regulations, part 50,\nsubpart A., August 8, 1989, italics added)\n\n\nHowever, the \u201cother practices that seriously deviate\u201d\nclause was heavily criticized because it could be used to suppress\ncreative or novel science. For example, the National Academy of\nScience stated in their report Responsible Science (1992)\nthat it\n\n\nwishes to discourage the possibility that a misconduct complaint could\nbe lodged against scientists based solely on their use of novel or\nunorthodox research methods. (NAS: 27)\n\n\nThis clause was therefore later removed from the definition. For an\nentry into the key philosophical literature on conduct in science, see\nShamoo & Resnick (2009).\n7. Conclusion\n\nThe question of the source of the success of science has been at the\ncore of philosophy since the beginning of modern science. If viewed as\na matter of epistemology more generally, scientific method is a part\nof the entire history of philosophy. Over that time, science and\nwhatever methods its practitioners may employ have changed\ndramatically. Today, many philosophers have taken up the banners of\npluralism or of practice to focus on what are, in effect, fine-grained\nand contextually limited examinations of scientific method. Others\nhope to shift perspectives in order to provide a renewed general\naccount of what characterizes the activity we call science.\n\nOne such perspective has been offered recently by Hoyningen-Huene\n(2008, 2013), who argues from the history of philosophy of science\nthat after three lengthy phases of characterizing science by its\nmethod, we are now in a phase where the belief in the existence of a\npositive scientific method has eroded and what has been left to\ncharacterize science is only its fallibility. First was a phase from\nPlato and Aristotle up until the 17th century where the\nspecificity of scientific knowledge was seen in its absolute certainty\nestablished by proof from evident axioms; next was a phase up to the\nmid-19th century in which the means to establish the\ncertainty of scientific knowledge had been generalized to include\ninductive procedures as well. In the third phase, which lasted until\nthe last decades of the 20th century, it was recognized\nthat empirical knowledge was fallible, but it was still granted a\nspecial status due to its distinctive mode of production. But now in\nthe fourth phase, according to Hoyningen-Huene, historical and\nphilosophical studies have shown how \u201cscientific methods with\nthe characteristics as posited in the second and third phase do not\nexist\u201d (2008: 168) and there is no longer any consensus among\nphilosophers and historians of science about the nature of science.\nFor Hoyningen-Huene, this is too negative a stance, and he therefore\nurges the question about the nature of science anew. His own answer to\nthis question is that \u201cscientific knowledge differs from other\nkinds of knowledge, especially everyday knowledge, primarily by being\nmore systematic\u201d (Hoyningen-Huene 2013: 14). Systematicity can\nhave several different dimensions: among them are more systematic\ndescriptions, explanations, predictions, defense of knowledge claims,\nepistemic connectedness, ideal of completeness, knowledge generation,\nrepresentation of knowledge and critical discourse. Hence, what\ncharacterizes science is the greater care in excluding possible\nalternative explanations, the more detailed elaboration with respect\nto data on which predictions are based, the greater care in detecting\nand eliminating sources of error, the more articulate connections to\nother pieces of knowledge, etc. On this position, what characterizes\nscience is not that the methods employed are unique to science, but\nthat the methods are more carefully employed.\n\nAnother, similar approach has been offered by Haack (2003). She sets\noff, similar to Hoyningen-Huene, from a dissatisfaction with the\nrecent clash between what she calls Old Deferentialism and New\nCynicism. The Old Deferentialist position is that science progressed\ninductively by accumulating true theories confirmed by empirical\nevidence or deductively by testing conjectures against basic\nstatements; while the New Cynics position is that science has no\nepistemic authority and no uniquely rational method and is merely just\npolitics. Haack insists that contrary to the views of the New Cynics,\nthere are objective epistemic standards, and there is something\nepistemologically special about science, even though the Old\nDeferentialists pictured this in a wrong way. Instead, she offers a\nnew Critical Commonsensist account on which standards of good, strong,\nsupportive evidence and well-conducted, honest, thorough and\nimaginative inquiry are not exclusive to the sciences, but the\nstandards by which we judge all inquirers. In this sense, science does\nnot differ in kind from other kinds of inquiry, but it may differ in\nthe degree to which it requires broad and detailed background\nknowledge and a familiarity with a technical vocabulary that only\nspecialists may possess.",
