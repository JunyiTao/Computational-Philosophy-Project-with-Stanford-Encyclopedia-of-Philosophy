    "main_text": "The Stag Hunt and the PD\n8. The Stag Hunt and the PD\n\nThe idea mentioned in the introduction that the PD models a problem of\ncooperation among rational agents is sometimes criticized because, in\na true PD, the cooperative outcome is not a nash equilibrium. Any\n\u201cproblem\u201d of this nature, the critics contend, would be an\nunsolvable one. (See for example, Sugden or Binmore 2005, chapter\n4.5.) By changing the payoff structure of the PD slightly, so that the\nreward payoff exceeds the temptation payoff, we obtain a game where\nmutual cooperation, as well as mutual defection, is a nash\nequilibrium. This game is known as the stag hunt. It might provide a\nbetter model for situations where cooperation is difficult, but still\npossible, and it may also be a better fit for other roles sometimes\nassigned to the PD. More specifically, a stag hunt is a two player,\ntwo move game with a payoff matrix like that for the PD given in\n section 1\n where the conditions PD1 are replaced by:\n\n(SH)  a.\n\\(R \\gt T\\)\n\n  b.\n\\(R \\gt P\\)\n\n  c.\n\\(P \\gt S\\)\n\n\n\nThe fable dramatizing the game and providing its name, gleaned from a\npassage in Rousseau's Discourse on Inequality, concerns a\nhunting expedition rather than a jail cell interrogation. Two hunters\nare are looking to bag a stag. Success is uncertain and, if it comes,\nrequire the efforts of both. On the other hand, either hunter can\nforsake his partner and catch a hare with a good chance of success. A\ntypical payoff matrix is shown below.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\\(\\bC\\)\n\\(\\bD\\) \n\n\\(\\bC\\)\n\\(4,4\\)\n\\(0,3\\) \n\n\\(\\bD\\)\n\\(3,0\\)\n\\(3,3\\)  \n\n\nHere the \u201ccooperative\u201d move is hunting stag with one's\npartner and \u201cdefection\u201d is hunting hare by oneself. The\n\u201ctemptation\u201d payoff in a stag hunt is no longer much of a\ntemptation, but we retain the payoff terminology for ease of\nexposition. In this case the temptation and punishment penalties are\nidentical, perhaps reflecting the fact that my partner's choice of\nprey has no effect on my success in hare-hunting. Alternatively we\ncould have temptation exceeding punishment, perhaps because hunting\nhare is more rewarding together than alone (though still less\nrewarding, of course, than hunting stag together), or we could have\npunishment exceeding temptation, perhaps because a second hare hunter\nrepresents unhelpful competition. Either way, the essence of the Stag\nHunt remains. There are two equilibria, one unanimously preferred to\nthe other. The stag hunt becomes a \u201cdilemma\u201d when\nrationality dictates that both players choose the action leading to\nthe inferior equilibrium. It is clear that if I am certain that my\npartner will hunt stag I should join him and that if I am certain that\nhe will hunt hare I should hunt hare as well. For this reason games\nwith this structure are sometimes called games of\n\u201cassurance\u201d or \u201ctrust.\u201d (But these should not\nbe confused with \u201ctrust game\u201d versions of the asynchronous\nPD discussed in the following section.) If I do not know what my\npartner will do, standard decision theory tells me to maximize\nexpectation. This requires, however, that I estimate the probability\nof my partner playing \\(\\bC\\) or \\(\\bD\\). If I lack information to\nform any such estimates, then one putative principle of rationality\n(\u201cindifference\u201d) suggests that I ought to treat all\noptions as equally likely. By this criterion I ought to hunt hare if\nand only if the following condition is met:\n\n(SHD) \\(T + P \\gt R +\nS\\)\n\n\nWhen SHD obtains, hare hunting is said to be the\n\u201crisk-dominant\u201d equilibrium. Let us call a stag hunt game\nwhere this condition is met a stag hunt dilemma. The matrix\nabove provides one example.\n\nAnother proposed principle of rationality (\u201cmaximin\u201d)\nsuggests that I ought to consider the worst payoff I could obtain\nunder any course of action, and choose that action that maximizes this\nvalue. Since the sucker payoff is the worst payoff in a stag hunt,\nthis principle suggests that any stag hunt presents a\ndilemma. Maximin, however, makes more sense as a principle of\nrationality for zero sum games, where it can be assumed that a\nrational opponent is trying to minimize my score, than for games like\nstag hunt, where a rational opponent may be quite happy to see me do\nwell, as long as he does so as well.\n\nThe stag hunt can be generalized in the obvious way to accommodate\nasymmetric and cardinal payoffs. The quadrilateral formed by the\ngames' graphical representation is convex, so the pure/impure\ndistinction no longer applies. (In other words, in a stag hunt no\nmixed strategies are ever preferred to mutual cooperation.) The most\nobvious way to generalize the game to many players would retain the\ncondition that there be exactly two equilibria, one unanimously\npreferred to the other. This might be a good model for cooperative\nactivity in which success requires full cooperation. Imagine, for\nexample, that a single polluter would spoil a lake, or a single leak\nwould thwart an investigation. If many agents are involved and, by\nappeal to indifference or for other reasons, we estimate a fifty-fifty\nchance of cooperation from each, then these examples would represent\nstag hunt dilemmas in an extreme form. Everyone would benefit if all\ncooperate, but only a very trusting fool would think it rational to\ncooperate himself. Perhaps some broader generalization to the\nmany-person case would represent the structure of other familiar\nsocial phenomena, but that matter will not be pursued here.\n\nThe cooperative outcome in the stag hunt can be assured by many of the\nsame means as are discussed here for the PD. As might be expected,\ncooperation is somewhat easier to come by in the two-person stag hunt\nthan in the two-person PD. Details will not be given here, but the\ninterested reader may consult Skyrms 2004, which is responsible for a\nresurgence of interest in this game.\n",
