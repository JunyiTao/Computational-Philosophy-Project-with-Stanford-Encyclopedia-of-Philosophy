Global Health Issues\n\nOne striking feature of the state of global health is that there are\nlarge inequalities in health outcomes and opportunities for health.\nConsider that life expectancy can vary a great deal. A person born in\nSierra Leone can expect to live about 40 years whereas one born in\nJapan can expect to live for 80 years. Malaria has been almost\nentirely eradicated in high-income countries, but it still kills about\na million people in developing countries per year (United Nations\n2009). A woman in Niger has a 1 in 7 chance of dying in childbirth,\nwhereas this is 1 in 11 000 for women in Canada (Benatar and Brock\n2011, 2021). The global burden of disease is by no means evenly spread\nnor does workforce capability correspond with areas of highest need.\nIn fact many of the countries that suffer from the greatest burdens of\ndisease have the fewest skilled healthcare workers. In addition,\npharmaceutical companies do not spend their research and development\nbudgets in ways that match where the needs are greatest. Rather,\nseeking the most profitable ventures, they are much more likely to\nspend resources developing drugs for lucrative markets where the\npayoffs are greatest, even when the marginal benefits to consumers are\nsmall. One example is the research and development resources\npharmaceutical companies frequently spend on developing drugs that are\nsimilar to others already available, rather than developing treatments\nfor diseases for which there are no cures. Historically, it is\nestimated that drug companies spent approximately 90% of their\nresearch and development resources in seeking treatment for about 10%\nof diseases and some argue that justice requires reorienting\nincentives for new research and development to better align with the\nglobal disease burden (Drugs for Neglected Diseases Working Group\n2001; Flory and Kitcher 2004).\n\nThe poor in developing countries are also often more vulnerable to\ndisease and less able to resist disease because of poor living\nconditions related to poverty. Lack of clean water, clean energy\nsources, inadequate nutrition, and other social determinants of health\nplay a key role in explaining this increased vulnerability. Living in\novercrowded houses can facilitate the spread of infectious diseases,\nsuch as tuberculosis. So, a number of issues that sustain poverty or\nexacerbate people\u2019s vulnerability to disease as a result of\npoverty should be of concern (Benatar and Brock 2021). As Norman\nDaniels argues, health inequalities among different social groups can\nbe considered unjust when they result from unjust distribution in\nfactors that are socially controllable that affect population health\n(Daniels 2011, 101). On this view many health inequalities that exist\nare ones that ought to be of concern as they meet this criterion. How\nshould responsibilities for improving this situation be allocated? In\nmany ways, but here we pick out just a few that have received\nconsiderable attention in the philosophical literature.\n\nThe current system of intellectual property rights is one troubling\narea. The World Trade Organization grants product patents for a twenty\nyear period which effectively renders many new medicines unaffordable\nfor the vast majority of the world\u2019s population and those in\ngreatest need. There are a number of innovative proposals aimed at\naddressing these issues. One prominent example is the Health Impact\nFund proposal developed by Thomas Pogge, which offers alternative ways\nto reward pharmaceutical companies, notably by how much impact they\nhave on actually curing diseases (Pogge 2008). The greater their\nimpact, the larger the share of the rewards they would receive from\nthe Health Impact Fund. Nicole Hassoun proposes a \u201cGlobal Health\nImpact\u201d certification program for rating pharmaceutical\ncompanies\u2019 contributions to the global poor (Hassoun 2020).\nCompanies would compete for the gold star rankings which could\nsignificantly affect consumption choices and thereby expected profits.\nIn both cases the aim is to create important incentives for key agents\nto care about how their products affect the global poor.\n\nThere are many other issues that concern philosophers in the domain of\nglobal health. There are worrying practices of experimentation on\ndisadvantaged subjects in developing countries (Emanuel et al. 2004).\nIncreasingly, clinical research has been outsourced to poor,\ndeveloping countries with populations that are often highly\nvulnerable. We might wonder about whether these populations are being\nexploited and whether the participants have compromised abilities to\nconsent to drug trials. In many cases the trials bring considerable\nhealth benefits that would not come their way were it not in the\ninterests of pharmaceutical companies to do clinical research in those\nlocations. If sufficient benefits accrue for local populations, some\nargue that these cases need not be of concern, while others disagree\n(Emanuel et al. 2004; London 2011).\n\nNew infectious diseases and the threat of pandemics are creating\nfurther questions about our responsibilities. Often the case is made\nthat national interests in public health in developed countries\nmandate concern for infectious diseases that originate in developing\ncountries. When resources for addressing these threats are limited,\nsome argue it is acceptable for states to prioritize their\npopulations, while others disagree (Hassoun 2021; Ferguson and Caplan\n2021; Savulescu 2020). There are also important debates about how to\ndistribute vaccines across borders and about whether other public\nhealth policies \u2013 e.g. immunity passports \u2013 violate\nindividual rights or are justified for protecting public health\n(Emanuel et al. 2020; Emanuel et al. 2021; Herlitz et al. 2021; Liu,\nSalwi, and Drolet 2020; Persad and Emanuel 2020; Voigt 2022; Jecker\n2022; Bramble 2020; Baylis and Kofler 2020a, 2020b; Jecker, Wightman,\nand Diekema, forthcoming). Some argue that global justice \u2013\nsolidarity and respect for human rights \u2013 demands addressing\ndiseases that are not as transmissible as COVID-19 and may not pose as\nsignificant threats to many people in developed countries (Daniels\n2007; Atuire and Hassoun 2023; Gould 2018; Lenard and Straehle 2012;\nBenatar and Brock 2021; Herlitz et al. 2021). There is also\nsignificant concern for fair procedures in addressing health crises\nglobally.\n\nFor more see also\n public health ethics,\n and\n justice, inequality, and health.\n",
