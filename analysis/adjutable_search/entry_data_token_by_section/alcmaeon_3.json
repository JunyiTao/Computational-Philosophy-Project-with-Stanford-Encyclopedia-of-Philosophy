    "main_text": "Life and Works || Alcmaeon\u2019s Book and the Evidence for Its Contents\n1.4 Alcmaeon\u2019s Book and the Evidence for Its Contents\n\nThe ancient tradition assigns one book to Alcmaeon, which came to bear\nthe traditional title of Presocratic treatises, On Nature\n(DK, A2), although this title probably does not go back to Alcmaeon\nhimself. Favorinus\u2019 report that Alcmaeon was the first to write\nsuch a treatise (DK, A1) is almost certainly wrong, since Anaximander\nwrote before Alcmaeon. Theophrastus\u2019 detailed report of\nAlcmaeon\u2019s account of the senses (DK, A5) and the fact that\nAristotle wrote a treatise in response to Alcmaeon (D.L. V. 25)\nsuggest that the book was available in the fourth century BCE. It is\nunclear whether Alcmaeon wrote in the Doric dialect of Croton or in\nthe Ionic Greek of the first Presocratics (Burkert, 1972, 222, n. 21).\nThe report that an Alcimon of Croton was the first to write animal\nfables might be a reference to a poet of a similar name. Fragment 5 in\nDK (\u201cIt is easier to be on one\u2019s guard against an enemy\nthan a friend.\u201d) sounds very much like the moral of such a fable\n(Gomperz 1953, 64\u20135). Diels and Kranz (=DK) identify five other\nfragments of Alcmaeon (Frs. 1, 1a, 2, 3, 4) and arrange the testimonia\nunder 18 headings. Fragments 1a, 3 and 4, however, are really\ntestimonia which use language of a later date, although some of\nAlcmaeon\u2019s terminology is embedded in them. The three lines of\nFragment 1, which probably began the book, and the half line in\nFragment 2 are the only continuous texts of Alcmaeon. Another brief\nfragment/testimonium should be added to the material in DK: \u201cthe\nearth is the mother of plants and the sun their father\u201d\n(Nicolaus Damascenus, De plantis I 2.44; see Kirk 1956 and\nLebedev 1993). There is also the possibility that Fr. 125 of the\nSpartan poet Alcman (\u201cExperience is the beginning of\nlearning.\u201d) should, in fact, be assigned to Alcmaeon (Lanza\n1965; Barnes 1982, 610).\n",
