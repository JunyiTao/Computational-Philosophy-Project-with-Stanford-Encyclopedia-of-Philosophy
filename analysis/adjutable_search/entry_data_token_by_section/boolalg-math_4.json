Decidability and undecidability questions\n\n\n A basic result of Tarski is that the elementary theory of Boolean\nalgebras is decidable. Even the theory of Boolean algebras with a\ndistinguished ideal is decidable. On the other hand, the theory of a\nBoolean algebra with a distinguished subalgebra is undecidable. Both\nthe decidability results and undecidablity results extend in various\nways to Boolean algebras in extensions of first-order logic.\n",
