    "main_text": "Scope of Decoherence || The world according to decoherence\n4.1 The world according to decoherence\n\nWhat seems very clear is that decoherence is crucial for the emergence\nof much of the macroscopic world around us, from the motions in the\nsolar system (cf. the discussion of the motion of Saturn\u2019s moon\nHyperion \u2013 for an assessment of which see Schlosshauer (2008))\nand down to the working of enzymes (which relies on their molecular\nshapes). The detailed picture of the world that emerges from\ndecoherence, however, is full of subtleties.\n\nFor one thing, while the more \u2018macroscopic\u2019 a system, the\nmore pervasive the effects of decoherence and the more complex the\nstructures that emerge through it, this is only a rule of thumb. Not\nall molecules are chiral (bound ammonia groups tend to be\nin superpositions for instance), and there is no clear-cut criterion\nfor when a system should count as macroscopic. Indeed, even apart from\nexamples like superconducting systems, there might be surprising cases\nin which not all interference effects have been suppressed by\ndecoherence even at the macroscopic level. A famous proposal by\nHameroff and Penrose (1996) links the phenomenon of consciousness with\nthe possibility of quantum superpositions within microtubules (and\ntheir subsequent active suppression via collapse); other authors\ninterpret the mathematically quantum-like effects described within\n\u2018quantum cognition\u2019 as actual quantum effects (for both, see the\nentry on\n quantum approaches to consciousness).\n At present, most macroscopic quantum effects remain speculative at\nbest, but plausible cases for the continuing relevance of quantum\nsuperpositions at the macroscopic level can be found in quantum\nbiology, notably the studies of possible quantum effects in the\nnavigational system of migrating birds (Cai, Guerreschi and Briegel\n2010).\n\nCloser to home, while the classical world is recognised as having been\nall the time a dynamical pattern emerging from quantum mechanics, it\nturns out to be less classical than we might have expected. One\ninteresting example is the description of classically chaotic systems.\nA straightforward application of the techniques allowing one to derive\nNewtonian trajectories at the level of components has been employed by\nZurek and Paz (1994) to derive chaotic trajectories in\nquantum mechanics. The problem with the quantum description of chaotic\nbehaviour is that prima facie it should be impossible. Chaos\nis characterised roughly as extreme sensitivity in the behaviour of a\nsystem on its initial conditions, in the sense that the distance\nbetween the trajectories arising from different initial conditions\nincreases exponentially in time (see the entry on\n chaos).\n Since the Schr\u00f6dinger evolution is unitary, it\npreserves all scalar products and all distances between quantum state\nvectors. Thus, it would seem, close initial conditions lead to\ntrajectories that are uniformly close throughout all of time, and no\nchaotic behaviour is possible (\u2018problem of quantum\nchaos\u2019). The crucial point that enables Zurek and Paz\u2019s\nanalysis is that the relevant trajectories defined by decoherence are\nat the level of components of the state of the system.\nUnitarity is preserved because the vectors in the environment, to\nwhich these different components are coupled, are and remain\northogonal: how the components themselves more specifically evolve is\nimmaterial. Explicit modelling yields a picture of quantum chaos in\nwhich different trajectories branch (a feature absent from classical\nchaos, which is deterministic) and then indeed diverge exponentially.\n(As with the crossing of trajectories in de Broglie\u2013Bohm theory\nin\n Section 3.2,\n one has behaviour at the level of components that is qualitatively\ndifferent from the behaviour derived for wave functions of an isolated\nsystem.) The qualitative picture is the same as we mentioned above in\n Section 1.3,\n of classical trajectories that are kicked slightly off course\n(trajectories with slight kinks). In the case of classically chaotic\nsystems, however, this has a dramatic effect. This means that systems\nlike the weather turn out to be \u2018branching\u2019 all the time\ndue to decoherence interactions, so that what we usually think of as\nclassical unpredictability is in fact quantum indeterminism! (For an\nexcellent discussion, see Wallace 2012a, Chapters 3 and 10.) \n\nAnd as we have also mentioned, quantum phenomena themselves\nare a feature of the world that emerges through decoherence (Zeh\n2003a, p. 33; see also Bacciagaluppi 2002, Section 6.2): not only the\nstability of the outcomes of laboratory measurements, and thus\n\u2018quantum phenomena\u2019 in the specific sense of Bohr, but\nalso quantum jumps or the appearance of \\(\\alpha\\)-particle trajectories\nare a direct consequence of decoherence. The classical world yielded\nby decoherence is thus one (or one of many!) punctuated by quantum\nphenomena.\n",
