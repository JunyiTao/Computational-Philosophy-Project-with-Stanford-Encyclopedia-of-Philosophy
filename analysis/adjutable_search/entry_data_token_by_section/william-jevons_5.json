    "main_text": "Unitarianism and Evolutionism\n6. Unitarianism and Evolutionism\n\n\nAlthough the bias regarding class, gender and race is obvious in\nJevons' work,  we should add that he was concerned with the\namelioration of society in general and the condition of the working\nclasses in particular. This attitude was inspired by the\nprogressive and Unitarian middle-class background from which Jevons\nemerged. Some remarks and reflections on religion can be found in\nhis diary and personal correspondence. \n\n\nAlthough Jevons does not discuss explicitly the Trinity, it is clear\nthat he believes in the existence of one God. He does not\ndescribe him as a personal being or father, but as a general principle\nof abstract goodness (Black 1973: 258). This abstract principle\nis in perfect accordance with scientific findings: he reports that his\nconception of God is derived from an examination of matter and\nmind. The world is a \u201cvast organism\u201d with order and\nform expressing intention and mind, which implies that God is\ninseparable from his works. He is visible \u201cin the wonderful\norder and simplicity of Nature, in the adaptation of means to ends, and\nin the creation of man to which everything refers, with power capable\nof indefinite improvement\u201d (Black & K\u00f6nekamp 1972:\n155). Jevons founds his faith \u201con Man and his\nfeelings\u201d, because humanity\u2019s mental feelings of love and\nsympathy are the only places where intentions of good can be\ndiscovered. Every religion refers to the same eternal principles\nor \u201cmoral truths\u201d, but the state of civilization determines\ntheir degree of misrepresentation. Different religions are merely\ncostumes thrown over these principles, and Unitarianism contains the\n\u201cmost simple and truth-like\u201d set of religious\nbeliefs. God is depicted as a principle of abstract goodness, and\nJesus is seen as the messenger who brought the eternal moral truths to\nhumankind. Whereas Newton was a genius of natural science and\nMozart of music, Jesus was a moral genius. The history of\nUnitarianism is also the history of a rational approach to religion,\nand a critical approach to the Holy Scripture. In general,\nUnitarians did not oppose scientific development, but on the contrary\nthey argued that science and religion should be seen as two sides of\nthe same coin.\n\n\nThe growing critical attitude of Unitarianism coincides historically\nwith the rise of evolutionary theory: especially Darwinism, but also\nwider theory such as the work of Auguste Comte and Herbert\nSpencer. Jevons was particularly favourable towards\nSpencer\u2019s evolutionary ethics. The evolutionary perspective\nallows Jevons to integrate his religious beliefs in a view on the world\nas growing towards higher moral consciousness and rationality. \nLike Spencer, Jevons argues that there is no conflict at all between\nscience and religion. On the contrary: they are both directed\ntowards truth, and therefore they cannot contradict each other. \nJevons congratulated John Herschel for his condemnation of the\nTheological Declaration of Scientific Man, which equated freedom of\ninquiry with a tendency to irreligion (Black 1977a: 60). Jevons\neven intended to write the Tenth Bridgewater Treatise (following\nCharles Babbage\u2019s Ninth Bridgewater Treatise) to show the perfect\ncompatibility between science and religion, but he never completed this\nwork.\n\n\nIn The Principles of Science Jevons devotes a (short)\nsection on the theory of evolution, followed by a section on the\npossibility of divine interference (Jevons 1874, pp. \n761\u20139). Jevons embraces Spencer\u2019s idea that the homogenous\nis unstable and differentiates itself in the process of evolutionary\ndevelopment. This explains why a variety of human institutions\nand characters emerged. He recognizes that evolutionary theory\nhas not been proved, but nevertheless he adheres to its\ntruthfulness. It is certainly not in conflict with theology,\nsince it does not lead to the conclusion that creation was and is\nimpossible. Evolutionary theory discloses several natural laws\nthat explain how primitive life evolved to humankind by processes of\nadaptation to changing circumstances \u2014 but the initial\ndistribution of atoms in the primeval world is very important as\nwell. Jevons argues that this initial distribution is the result\nof the \u201carbitrary choice of the Creator\u201d, which could have\nbeen very different and therefore present life would have been very\ndifferent as well. Evolutionary theory tells us only that similar\ncircumstances will lead to similar results since the same laws apply,\nbut this is not in conflict with an initial act of creation. In\nclose accordance with Spencer\u2019s First Principles, Jevons\nstates that it would be absurd to deny that anything exists, and that\nit therefore might be equally conceivable that the world was created\nout of nothing or that it existed from eternity. He also states\nclearly that science cannot disprove the possibility of divine\nintervention, which implies that a positivist attitude does not\nnecessarily lead to materialism or atheism. Jevons also takes\ndistance from Comte\u2019s positivistic philosophy, by arguing \u2014\nlike Spencer \u2014 that scientific reflection on higher notions of\ncreation must necessarily end up in contradictions.\n",
