    "main_text": "Physical Privacy\n2. Physical Privacy\n\nThere has been relatively little attention paid by philosophers to\nphysical privacy concerns in medicine compared to informational\nconcerns. Yet typical patients bring a bevy of strong expectations of\nmodesty, solitude and bodily integrity to doctors\u2019 offices,\nhospitals, telemedicine visits and other health care encounters. These\nexpectations that they will not be needlessly touched, crowded, gawked\nat or secretly filmed, recorded or imaged relate to the need for\npsychological comfort, dignity and security. The internet has made\ndelivering health care possible across vast distances. (Chepesiuk\n1999). Telemedicine, which grew exponentially during the first year if\nthe COVID-19 crisis, allowed doctors and nurses to evaluate common\nmedical complaints remotely without touching the patient. In the\nmeantime, health care typically involves physical contact with\nothers.\n",
