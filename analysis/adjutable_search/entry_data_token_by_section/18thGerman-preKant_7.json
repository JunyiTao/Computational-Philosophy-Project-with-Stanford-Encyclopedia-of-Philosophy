    "main_text": "Alexander Gottlieb Baumgarten\n4. Alexander Gottlieb Baumgarten\n\nA. G. Baumgarten is best known for authoring the textbook in\nmetaphysics that Kant used for his lectures on the topic, though he\nwas an important and innovative thinker in his own right. His\nphilosophical ambitions are, moreover, deeply informed by the\ncontroversy in Halle, as he had an abiding intellectual sympathy with\nWolffianism but theological and personal connections to the Pietists.\nAmong his students was the notable Wolffian philosopher Georg\nFriedrich Meier (1717\u201377), and his own influence extended to\nKant but also to Moses Mendelssohn and J. G. Herder.\n",
