    "main_text": "The Nature of Modality || Necessitarianism Vindicated\n2.1 Necessitarianism Vindicated\n\nWith this analysis in hand, let us return to Garrett\u2019s proposed\naccount of Spinoza\u2019s necessitarianism. Garrett claims in [iv]\nthat each particular mode, conceived in relation to all the other\nparticular modes, follows from God\u2019s nature, and he concludes\nthat therefore every finite mode exists necessarily. However,\naccording to [v], the same finite mode conceived independently of the\nrelation to every other finite modes fails to follow from God and so\nfails to exist necessarily. Spinoza\u2019s conceptual account of\nmodality explains why he thought modality works in this particular\nway.\n\nSuppose the entire collection of finite modes, considered as a whole,\nfollows from a necessarily existing infinite mode. Hence, the entire\ncollection as a whole exists necessarily. In order for a particular\nfinite mode in that collection to exist necessarily, it must be\nconceived as following from something that exists necessarily. How can\na finite mode be conceived as following from something that exists\nnecessarily? The answer is clear: by being conceived in relation to\nthe whole collection. That is, when finite modes are considered in\nrelation to all the other finite modes, the right conceptual\nconnection obtains and Spinoza\u2019s modal transfer principle is\nsatisfied. This provides an answer to (2\u2032) from the previous\nsection. Whether a mode is considered in relation to the rest of the\nseries is relevant to its modal status because (a) modal facts are\nsensitive to the conceptual relations that the considering relation\npicks up on and (b) considering a particular finite mode in relation\nto the whole series of finite modes tracks the relevant conceptual\nconnection that satisfies the modal transfer principle.\n\nOf course, not just any way of considering a finite mode will be\nrelevant for its modal status. Considered as \u201cthe largest piece\nof furniture in the office,\u201d the desk does not exist\nnecessarily. By Spinoza\u2019s lights, the way of conceiving the desk\nneeds to involve something that follows from God\u2019s nature if the\ndesk is to exist necessarily. This is why, if Garrett is correct,\nconsidering the desk in relation to the rest of the entire series of\nfinite objects is relevant for its modal status, whereas considering\nthe desk in other, less causally relevant or more isolated ways, is\n not.[15]\n",
