    "main_text": "The unity of nature and freedom || The great chasm\n7.1 The great chasm\n\nIn the Preface and Introduction to the Critique of the Power of\nJudgment, Kant announces that his goal in the work is to\n\u201cbring [his] entire critical enterprise to an end\u201d by\nbridging the \u201cgulf\u201d or \u201cchasm\u201d that separates\nthe domain of his theoretical philosophy (discussed mainly in the\nCritique of Pure Reason) from the domain of his practical\nphilosophy (discussed mainly in the Critique of Practical\nReason) (5:170, 176, 195). In his words: \u201cThe understanding\nlegislates a priori for nature, as object of the senses, for a\ntheoretical cognition of it in a possible experience. Reason\nlegislates a priori for freedom and its own causality, as the\nsupersensible in the subject, for an unconditioned practical\ncognition. The domain of the concept of nature under the one\nlegislation and that of the concept of freedom under the other are\nentirely barred from any mutual influence that they could have on each\nother by themselves (each in accordance with its fundamental laws) by\nthe great chasm that separates the supersensible from the\nappearances\u201d (5:195).\n\nOne way to understand the problem Kant is articulating here is to\nconsider it once again in terms of the crisis of the\n Enlightenment.[27]\n The crisis was that modern science threatened to undermine\ntraditional moral and religious beliefs, and Kant\u2019s response is\nto argue that in fact these essential interests of humanity are\nconsistent with one another when reason is granted sovereignty and\npractical reason is given primacy over speculative reason. But the\ntranscendental idealist framework within which Kant develops this\nresponse seems to purchase the consistency of these interests at the\nprice of sacrificing a unified view of the world and our place in it.\nIf science applies only to appearances, while moral and religious\nbeliefs refer to things in themselves or \u201cthe\nsupersensible,\u201d then how can we integrate these into a single\nconception of the world that enables us to transition from the one\ndomain to the other? Kant\u2019s solution is to introduce a third a\npriori cognitive faculty, which he calls the reflecting power of\njudgment, that gives us a teleological perspective on the world.\nReflecting judgment provides the concept of teleology or purposiveness\nthat bridges the chasm between nature and freedom, and thus unifies\nthe theoretical and practical parts of Kant\u2019s philosophy into a\nsingle system (5:196\u2013197).\n\nIt is important to Kant that a third faculty independent of both\nunderstanding and reason provides this mediating perspective, because\nhe holds that we do not have adequate theoretical grounds for\nattributing objective teleology to nature itself, and yet regarding\nnature as teleological solely on moral grounds would only heighten the\ndisconnect between our scientific and moral ways of viewing the world.\nTheoretical grounds do not justify us in attributing objective\nteleology to nature, because it is not a condition of\nself-consciousness that our understanding construct experience in\naccordance with the concept of teleology, which is not among\nKant\u2019s categories or the principles of pure understanding that\nground the fundamental laws of nature. That is why his theoretical\nphilosophy licenses us only in attributing mechanical causation to\nnature itself. To this limited extent, Kant is sympathetic to the\ndominant strain in modern philosophy that banishes final causes from\nnature and instead treats nature as nothing but matter in motion,\nwhich can be fully described mathematically. But Kant wants somehow to\nreconcile this mechanistic view of nature with a conception of human\nagency that is essentially teleological. As we saw in the previous\nsection, Kant holds that every human action has an end and that the\nsum of all moral duties is to promote the highest good. It is\nessential to Kant\u2019s approach, however, to maintain the autonomy\nof both understanding (in nature) and reason (in morality), without\nallowing either to encroach on the other\u2019s domain, and yet to\nharmonize them in a single system. This harmony can be orchestrated\nonly from an independent standpoint, from which we do not judge how\nnature is constituted objectively (that is the job of understanding)\nor how the world ought to be (the job of reason), but from which we\nmerely regulate or reflect on our cognition in a way that enables us\nto regard it as systematically unified. According to Kant, this is the\ntask of reflecting judgment, whose a priori principle is to regard\nnature as purposive or teleological, \u201cbut only as a regulative\nprinciple of the faculty of cognition\u201d (5:197).\n",
