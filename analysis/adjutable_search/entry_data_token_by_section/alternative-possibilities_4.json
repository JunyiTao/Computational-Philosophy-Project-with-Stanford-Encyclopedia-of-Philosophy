    "main_text": "Background || A Note on Freedom\n1.4 A Note on Freedom\n\nA final preliminary point concerns acting freely. A principle\nclosely related to PAP is the following (Audi 1974; van Inwagen 1983:\n161; Widerker & McKenna 2003: 2):\n\n\nFreedom Condition: a person is morally responsible\nfor what she has done only if she did it freely.\n\n\nThis principle raises many of the issues that will come up below. But\nit\u2019s stronger than PAP if, as is plausible, freedom requires\nmore than alternatives (see entry on\n free will).\n Being the source of one\u2019s action may be one such requirement;\nhaving properly functioning faculties could be another; agent-causing\none\u2019s action may be yet another. Investigating the Freedom\nCondition would thus bring in additional topics that cannot be\nexplored here. So the discussion to follow will skirt the problems of\nfree action (and free will) and instead focus on PAP\u2019s weaker\nrequirement. But at least this much is worth noting: if PAP is false,\nthen so is the Freedom Condition, assuming that one must have\nalternatives to act freely (see also Warfield 2007; McKenna 2008:\n353).\n",
