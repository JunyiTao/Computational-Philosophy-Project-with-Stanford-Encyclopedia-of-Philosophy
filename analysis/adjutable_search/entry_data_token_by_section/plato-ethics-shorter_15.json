    "main_text": "Euthydemus\n19. Euthydemus\n\nThe Euthydemus is more complex in structure than the other\ndialogues in this group. A substantial framing dialogue between\nSocrates and Crito surrounds and intrudes upon a reported discussion\ninvolving Socrates and two brothers, Euthydemus and Dionysodorus,\ntravelling teachers who have much in common with the sophists, and who\nclaim to teach virtue, rather than the forensic rhetoric expected of\nsuch experts (274d). The discussion takes place at the Lyceum, for the\nbenefit of the boy Clinias and his admirer Ctesippus. The main\nquestion in both the frame and the embedded dialogue concerns\neducation: To what sort of teaching should the young be entrusted?\n\nSocrates challenges the brothers to show that, in addition to teaching\nvirtue, they can convince a pupil that he should learn virtue from\nthem. Instead of rising to this challenge directly, the brothers\nentangle Clinias in two verbal traps and are preparing a third when\nSocrates interrupts with the diagnosis (obviously correct) that these\ntraps depend on ignoring the careful use of verbal distinctions\n(277d\u2013278a).\n\nSocrates then demonstrates his method of attracting a young person to\nthe pursuit of virtue and wisdom, which, by the end of the passage,\nhave been conflated into wisdom. With Clinias, he lists various good\nthings: Wealth, health, good looks, and honor comprise one list, while\ncourage, sound-mindedness, justice, and wisdom comprise another. Then\nSocrates surprises the boy by claiming that good fortune simply is\nwisdom; he defends the claim by arguing that no good thing is\nbeneficial unless its use is guided by wisdom. It follows that the\nitems on the first list are neither good nor bad in themselves (281d),\nand that the principal good to pursue is wisdom. We are probably left\nto suppose that the virtues on the second list are identical to\nwisdom. In any event, Clinias now expresses his wish to acquire\nwisdom.\n\nThe brothers intervene with new and more disturbing arguments: it is\nnot possible to speak false or to hold a false view or to contradict,\nthey say, possibly echoing theses of the sophist Protagoras.\n\nThe second conversation between Socrates and Clinias treats wisdom as\na\n techne \n and explores the subordination of one techne to another, as the art\nof the general (winning battles) is subordinate to the art of politics\n(making use of victories). The supreme techne he calls kingly\nor royal, and this is the techne that guides the use of all\nothers (291c), but this line of inquiry founders on a question that\nappears unanswerable: What is the specific knowledge that is given by\nthe kingly techne? A techne is supposed to have a\nwell-defined subject matter, but the kingly techne, which\nrequires general wisdom, would oversee all subject matter and\ntherefore would seem to have no subject matter proper to itself.\nPerhaps Socrates thinks the subject of this techne is good\nand evil, or perhaps virtue, but he does not say either, nor does he\nexplain how these could be the subjects of a\n techne.\n Because a techne is, by definition, teachable, Socrates\nwould have to establish that such knowledge can be taught, but as we\nsee from the\n Protagoras\n Socrates has grave doubts on this score.\n\nA few more traps are set by the brothers, who exploit the similarity\nbetween complete (or absolute) and incomplete (or relative)\npredication: the dog is a dog in any semantic context, but he is a\nfather in relation to his puppies only, and not to his master.\n\nSocrates returns to his framing discussion with Crito on the\noverarching theme of the dialogue, the question of what sort of study\nshould be pursued as philosophy, and this is left as a challenge for\nCrito. The dialogue ends, as do most in this group,\ninconclusively.\n",
