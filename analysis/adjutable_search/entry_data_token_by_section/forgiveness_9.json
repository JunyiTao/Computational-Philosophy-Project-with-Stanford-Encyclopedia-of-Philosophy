    "main_text": "Theories of Forgiveness || Butlerian Accounts\n5.2 Butlerian Accounts\n\nBishop Joseph Butler is commonly cited as the progenitor of emotion\naccounts. In a way, this is not surprising, for his legacy in the\nphilosophical literature on forgiveness rests on two of his\nFifteen Sermons (1726): Sermon VIII (\u201cUpon\nResentment\u201d) and Sermon IX (\u201cUpon Forgiveness of\nInjuries\u201d). Butler does indeed make clear that resentment and\nforgiveness are importantly related, and his interpreters have often\nattributed to him the view that forgiveness is the\nforswearing or overcoming of resentment (Murphy\n1988: 15; Haber 1991: 16; Holmgren 1993: 341)\n\nErnesto Garcia (2011) has called this interpretation of Butler the\n\u201cRenunciation Model\u201d, according to which Butler holds: (1)\nthat resentment is a \u201cnegative vindictive response that is\nincompatible with goodwill\u201d; and (2) that forgiveness occurs\n\u201conly insofar as we forswear or renounce our negative feelings\nof resentment towards our wrongdoers\u201d (2011: 2). Garcia and\nothers have convincingly argued, however, that Butler did not\nadvocate the Renunciation Model, for he advocated neither of these two\ntheses (Garcia 2011; Griswold 2007: 19\u201337, and Newberry 2001).\nThis is not the place to explore Butler\u2019s view in great detail.\nHowever, we can bring into relief enough of Butler\u2019s account of\nforgiveness to show why he does not advocate the Renunciation\nModel.\n\nConsider the claim that Butler held that resentment is a response to\ninjury that is incompatible with good-will and therefore forgiveness.\nWhat Butler actually says, however, is that forgiveness is perfectly\ncompatible with an attitude of resentment. Butler held that resentment\nhelps us to deal with those who harm us: it motivates us to insulate\nourselves from wrongdoers, and it motivates us to deter future\nwrongdoing via punishment. When resentment has these ends it serves\nthe public good and is therefore compatible with the general\nobligation to good-will [IX.9]. Indeed, as Butler puts it, resentment\nis both \u201cnatural\u201d [VIII. 11] and \u201cinnocent\u201d\n[VIII.19]. Therefore, resentment as such is compatible with\ngood-will.\n\nButler does say that resentment can be dangerous, but it is not\nresentment as such that is the problem. Rather, he claims that when\nresentment is allowed to become \u201cexcessive\u201d it can easily\nlead an agent to pursue revenge, not as a means to producing some\ngreater social good, but as a self-gratifying exercise that seeks\n\u201cthe misery of our fellow creatures\u201d [IX.10]. But to let\nresentment carry one this far is to violate a general obligation to\nbenevolence. To forgive, then, is simply to prevent resentment from\nhaving this effect on us. The divine command to benevolence is\ntherefore just the command to \u201cprevent [resentment] from having\nthis effect, i.e. to forgive injuries, is the same as to love\nour enemies\u201d [IX.13.]. Resentment itself is natural and\ninnocent. It is only when it is indulged and allowed to bleed into\nrevenge that a violation of goodwill occurs. But this is the work of\nforgiveness: to prevent resentment from leading us to seek revenge.\nTherefore, Butler does not think that forgiveness is the forswearing\nor overcoming of resentment.\n\nWhat, then, is forgiveness according to Butler? Griswold\nclaims that Butler\u2019s forgiveness involves two aspects: (1) the\nforswearing of revenge; and (2) a moderation of resentment to\nan appropriate level (2007: 36). Yet according to Ernesto Garcia,\n\u201cButlerian forgiveness simply amounts to being virtuously\nresentful by avoiding both excessive and deficient resentment against\nour wrongdoers\u201d (2011: 17). On Garcia\u2019s interpretation,\nButlerian forgiveness seems to require no emotional change at\nall\u2014one can be virtuously resentful without ever having been\nviciously resentful. It is unclear whether Griswold thinks that Butler\nwould require emotional change. If all that is required is that\nresentment be kept in check, this could be done without it ever having\nbeen excessive. On the other hand, if the requirement is that one must\ngo through the process of moderating one\u2019s resentment,\nthis would require some kind emotional change (although not one that\nwould require eliminating it entirely or even trying to do so). \n",
