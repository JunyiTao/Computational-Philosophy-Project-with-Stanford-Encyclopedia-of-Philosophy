    "main_text": "\n1. Introduction: The Continuous, the Discrete, and the Infinitesimal\n\nWe are all familiar with the idea of continuity. To be\n continuous[1]\n is to constitute an unbroken or uninterrupted whole, like the ocean\nor the sky. A continuous entity\u2014a continuum\u2014has\nno \u201cgaps\u201d. Opposed to continuity is discreteness:\nto be\n discrete[2]\n is to be separated, like the scattered pebbles on a beach or the\nleaves on a tree. Continuity connotes unity; discreteness,\nplurality.\n\nWhile it is the fundamental nature of a continuum to be\nundivided, it is nevertheless generally (although not\ninvariably) held that any continuum admits of repeated or successive\ndivision without limit. This means that the process of\ndividing it into ever smaller parts will never terminate in an\nindivisible or an atom\u2014that is, a part which,\nlacking proper parts itself, cannot be further divided. In a word,\ncontinua are divisible without limit or infinitely\ndivisible. The unity of a continuum thus conceals a potentially\ninfinite plurality. In antiquity this claim met with the objection\nthat, were one to carry out completely\u2014if only in\nimagination\u2014the process of dividing an extended magnitude, such\nas a continuous line, then the magnitude would be reduced to a\nmultitude of atoms\u2014in this case, extensionless points\u2014or\neven, possibly, to nothing at all. But then, it was held, no matter\nhow many such points there may be\u2014even if infinitely\nmany\u2014they cannot be \u201creassembled\u201d to form the\noriginal magnitude, for surely a sum of extensionless elements still\nlacks\n extension.[3]\n Moreover, if indeed (as seems unavoidable) infinitely many points\nremain after the division, then, following Zeno, the magnitude may be\ntaken to be a (finite) motion, leading to the seemingly absurd\nconclusion that infinitely many points can be \u201ctouched\u201d in\na finite time.\n\nSuch difficulties attended the birth, in the fifth century BCE, of the\nschool of atomism. The founders of this school, Leucippus and\nDemocritus, claimed that matter, and, more generally, extension, is\nnot infinitely divisible. Not only would the successive division of\nmatter ultimately terminate in atoms, that is, in discrete particles\nincapable of being further divided, but matter had in\nactuality to be conceived as being compounded from such atoms. In\nattacking infinite divisibility the atomists were at the same time\nmounting a claim that the continuous is ultimately reducible to the\ndiscrete, whether it be at the physical, theoretical, or perceptual\nlevel.\n\nThe eventual triumph of the atomic theory in physics and chemistry in\nthe nineteenth century paved the way for the idea of\n\u201catomism\u201d, as applying to matter, at least, to become\nwidely familiar: it might well be said, to adapt Sir William\nHarcourt\u2019s famous observation in respect of the socialists of\nhis day, \u201cWe are all atomists now\u201d. Nevertheless, only a\nminority of philosophers of the past espoused atomism at a\nmetaphysical level, a fact which may explain why the analogous\ndoctrine upholding continuity lacks a familiar name: that which is\nunconsciously acknowledged requires no name. Peirce coined the term\nsynechism (from Greek syneche,\n\u201ccontinuous\u201d) for his own philosophy\u2014a philosophy\npermeated by the idea of continuity in its sense of \u201cbeing\n connected\u201d.[4]\n In this article I shall appropriate Peirce\u2019s term and use it in\na sense shorn of its Peircean overtones, simply as a contrary to\natomism. I shall also use the term \u201cdivisionism\u201d for the\nmore specific doctrine that continua are infinitely divisible.\n\nClosely associated with the concept of a continuum is that of\n infinitesimal.[5]\n An infinitesimal magnitude has been somewhat hazily\nconceived as a continuum \u201cviewed in the small\u201d, an\n\u201cultimate part\u201d of a continuum. In something like the same\nsense as a discrete entity is made up of its individual units, its\n\u201cindivisibles\u201d, so, it was maintained, a continuum is\n\u201ccomposed\u201d of infinitesimal magnitudes, its ultimate\nparts. (It is in this sense, for example, that mathematicians of the\nseventeenth century held that continuous curves are\n\u201ccomposed\u201d of infinitesimal straight lines.) Now the\n\u201ccoherence\u201d of a continuum entails that each of its\n(connected) parts is also a continuum, and, accordingly, divisible.\nSince points are indivisible, it follows that no point can be part of\na continuum. Infinitesimal magnitudes, as parts of continua, cannot,\nof necessity, be points: they are, in a word,\nnonpunctiform.\n\nMagnitudes are normally taken as being extensive quantities,\nlike mass or volume, which are defined over extended regions of space.\nBy contrast, infinitesimal magnitudes have been construed as\nintensive magnitudes resembling locally defined intensive\nquantities such as temperature or density. The effect of\n\u201cdistributing\u201d or \u201cintegrating\u201d an intensive\nquantity over such an intensive magnitude is to convert the former\ninto an infinitesimal extensive quantity: thus temperature is\ntransformed into infinitesimal heat and density into infinitesimal\nmass. When the continuum is the trace of a motion, the associated\ninfinitesimal/intensive magnitudes have been identified as\npotential magnitudes\u2014entities which, while not\npossessing true magnitude themselves, possess a tendency to\ngenerate magnitude through motion, so manifesting\n\u201cbecoming\u201d as opposed to \u201cbeing\u201d.\n\nAn infinitesimal number is one which, while not coinciding\nwith zero, is in some sense smaller than any finite number. This sense\nhas often been taken to be the failure to satisfy the Principle of\nArchimedes, which amounts to saying that an infinitesimal number\nis one that, no matter how many times it is added to itself, the\nresult remains less than any finite number. In the engineer\u2019s\npractical treatment of the differential calculus, an infinitesimal is\na number so small that its square and all higher powers can be\nneglected. In the theory of limits the term\n\u201cinfinitesimal\u201d is sometimes applied to any sequence whose\nlimit is zero.\n\nThe concept of an indivisible is closely allied to, but to be\ndistinguished from, that of an infinitesimal. An indivisible is, by\ndefinition, something that cannot be divided, which is usually\nunderstood to mean that it has no proper parts. Now a partless, or\nindivisible entity does not necessarily have to be infinitesimal:\nsouls, individual consciousnesses, and Leibnizian monads all\nsupposedly lack parts but are surely not infinitesimal. But these have\nin common the feature of being unextended; extended entities such as\nlines, surfaces, and volumes prove a much richer source of\n\u201cindivisibles\u201d. Indeed, if the process of dividing such\nentities were to terminate, as the atomists maintained, it would\nnecessarily issue in indivisibles of a qualitatively different nature.\nIn the case of a straight line, such indivisibles would, plausibly, be\npoints; in the case of a circle, straight lines; and in the case of a\ncylinder divided by sections parallel to its base, circles. In each\ncase the indivisible in question is infinitesimal in the sense of\npossessing one fewer dimension than the figure from which it is\ngenerated. In the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries\nindivisibles in this sense were used in the calculation of areas and\nvolumes of curvilinear figures, a surface or volume being thought of\nas a collection, or sum, of linear, or planar indivisibles\nrespectively.\n\nThe concept of infinitesimal was beset by controversy from its\nbeginnings. The idea makes an early appearance in the mathematics of\nthe Greek atomist philosopher Democritus c. 450 BCE, only to be\nbanished c. 350 BCE by Eudoxus in what was to become official\n\u201cEuclidean\u201d mathematics. We have noted their reappearance\nas indivisibles in the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries: in this\nform they were systematically employed by Kepler, Galileo\u2019s\nstudent Cavalieri, the Bernoulli clan, and a number of other\nmathematicians. In the guise of the beguilingly named\n\u201clinelets\u201d and \u201ctimelets\u201d, infinitesimals\nplayed an essential role in Barrow\u2019s \u201cmethod for finding\ntangents by calculation\u201d (1670 [1916: 119]), which appears in\nhis Lectiones Geometricae of 1670. As \u201cevanescent\nquantities\u201d infinitesimals were instrumental (although later\nabandoned) in Newton\u2019s development of the calculus, and, as\n\u201cinassignable quantities\u201d, in Leibniz\u2019s. The Marquis\nde L\u2019H\u00f4pital, who in 1696 published the first treatise on\nthe differential calculus (entitled Analyse des Infiniments Petits\npour l\u2019Intelligence des Lignes Courbes), invokes the\nconcept in postulating that \u201ca curved line may be regarded as\nbeing made up of infinitely small straight line segments\u201d (1696:\n3 [Postulate II]), and that \u201cone can take as equal two\nquantities differing by an infinitely small quantity\u201d (1696: 2\n[Postulate 1]).\n\nHowever useful it may have been in practice, the concept of\ninfinitesimal could scarcely withstand logical scrutiny. Derided by\nBerkeley in the eighteenth century as \u201cGhosts of departed\nQuantities\u201d (1734: 59), in the nineteenth century execrated by\nCantor as \u201ccholera-bacilli\u201d infecting mathematics (1893\n[1965: 505], translated by Fisher 1981: 116), and in the twentieth\nroundly condemned by Bertrand Russell as \u201cunnecessary,\nerroneous, and self-contradictory\u201d (1903: 345), these useful,\nbut logically dubious entities were believed to have been finally\nsupplanted in the foundations of analysis by the limit concept which\ntook rigorous and final form in the latter half of the nineteenth\ncentury. By the beginning of the twentieth century, the concept of\ninfinitesimal had become, in analysis at least, a virtual\n\u201cunconcept\u201d.\n\nNevertheless the proscription of infinitesimals did not succeed in\nextirpating them; they were, rather, driven further underground.\nPhysicists and engineers, for example, never abandoned their use as a\nheuristic device for the derivation of correct results in the\napplication of the calculus to physical problems. Differential\ngeometers of the stature of Sophus Lie and \u00c9lie Cartan relied on\ntheir use in the formulation of concepts which would later be put on a\n\u201crigorous\u201d footing. And, in a technical sense, they lived\non in the algebraists\u2019 investigations of non-Archimedean\nfields.\n\nA new phase in the long contest between the continuous and the\ndiscrete has opened in the past few decades with the refounding of the\nconcept of infinitesimal on a solid basis. This has been achieved in\ntwo essentially different ways, the one providing a rigorous\nformulation of the idea of infinitesimal number, the other of\ninfinitesimal magnitude.\n\nFirst, in the 1960s Abraham Robinson, using methods of mathematical\nlogic, created nonstandard analysis, an extension of\nmathematical analysis embracing both \u201cinfinitely large\u201d\nand infinitesimal numbers in which the usual laws of the arithmetic of\nreal numbers continue to hold, an idea which, in essence, goes back to\nLeibniz. Here by an infinitely large number is meant one which exceeds\nevery positive integer; the reciprocal of any one of these is\ninfinitesimal in the sense that, while being nonzero, it is smaller\nthan every positive fraction \\(1/n\\). Much of the usefulness of\nnonstandard analysis stems from the fact that within it every\nstatement of ordinary analysis involving limits has a succinct and\nhighly intuitive translation into the language of infinitesimals.\n\nThe second development in the refounding of the concept of\ninfinitesimal took place in the 1970s with the emergence of\nsynthetic differential geometry, also known as smooth\ninfinitesimal analysis. Based on the ideas of the American\nmathematician F. W. Lawvere, and employing the methods of category\ntheory, smooth infinitesimal analysis provides an image of the world\nin which the continuous is an autonomous notion, not explicable in\nterms of the discrete. It provides a rigorous framework for\nmathematical analysis in which every function between spaces is smooth\n(i.e., differentiable arbitrarily many times, and so in particular\ncontinuous) and in which the use of limits in defining the basic\nnotions of the calculus is replaced by nilpotent\ninfinitesimals, that is, of quantities so small (but not actually\nzero) that some power\u2014most usefully, the square\u2014vanishes.\nSmooth infinitesimal analysis embodies a concept of intensive\nmagnitude in the form of infinitesimal tangent vectors to\ncurves. A tangent vector to a curve at a point \\(p\\) on it is a short\nstraight line segment \\(l\\) passing through the point and pointing\nalong the curve. In fact we may take \\(l\\) actually to be an\ninfinitesimal part of the curve. Curves in smooth\ninfinitesimal analysis are \u201clocally straight\u201d and\naccordingly may be conceived as being \u201ccomposed of\u201d\ninfinitesimal straight lines in de L\u2019H\u00f4pital\u2019s\nsense, or as being \u201cgenerated\u201d by an infinitesimal tangent\nvector.\n\nThe development of nonstandard and smooth infinitesimal analysis has\nbreathed new life into the concept of infinitesimal,\nand\u2014especially in connection with smooth infinitesimal\nanalysis\u2014supplied novel insights into the nature of the\ncontinuum.\n2. The Continuum and the Infinitesimal in the Ancient Period\n\nThe opposition between Continuity and Discreteness played a\nsignificant role in ancient Greek philosophy. This probably derived\nfrom the still more fundamental question concerning the One and the\nMany, an antithesis lying at the heart of early Greek thought (Stokes\n1971). The Greek debate over the continuous and the discrete seems to\nhave been ignited by the efforts of Eleatic philosophers such as\nParmenides (c. 515 BCE), and Zeno (c. 460 BCE) to establish their\ndoctrine of absolute\n monism.[6]\n They were concerned to show that the divisibility of Being into parts\nleads to contradiction, so forcing the conclusion that the apparently\ndiverse world is a static, changeless\n unity.[7]\n In his Way of Truth Parmenides asserts that Being is\nhomogeneous and continuous. However in asserting the\ncontinuity of Being Parmenides is likely no more than underscoring its\nessential unity. Parmenides seems to be claiming that Being is more\nthan merely continuous\u2014that it is, in fact, a single whole,\nindeed an indivisible whole. The single Parmenidean existent\nis a continuum without parts, at once a continuum and an atom. If\nParmenides was a synechist, his absolute monism precluded his being at\nthe same time a divisionist.\n\nIn support of Parmenides\u2019 doctrine of changelessness Zeno\nformulated his famous paradoxes of motion. (see entry on\n Zeno\u2019s paradoxes)\n The Dichotomy and Achilles paradoxes both rest\nexplicitly on the limitless divisibility of space and time.\n\nThe doctrine of\n Atomism,[8]\n which seems to have arisen as an attempt at escaping the Eleatic\ndilemma, was first and foremost a physical theory. It was mounted by\nLeucippus (fl. 440 BCE) and Democritus (b. 460\u2013457 BCE) who\nmaintained that matter was not divisible without limit, but composed\nof indivisible, solid, homogeneous, spatially extended corpuscles, all\nbelow the level of visibility.\n\nAtomism was challenged by Aristotle (384\u2013322 BCE), who was the\nfirst to undertake the systematic analysis of continuity and\ndiscreteness. A thoroughgoing synechist, he maintained that physical\nreality is a continuous plenum, and that the structure of a continuum,\ncommon to space, time and motion, is not reducible to anything else.\nHis answer to the Eleatic problem was that continuous magnitudes are\npotentially divisible to infinity, in the sense that they may be\ndivided anywhere, though they cannot be divided\neverywhere at the same time.\n\nAristotle identifies continuity and discreteness as attributes\napplying to the category of\n Quantity.[9]\n As examples of continuous quantities, or continua, he offers\nlines, planes, solids (i.e., solid bodies), extensions, movement, time\nand space; among discrete quantities he includes\n number[10]\n and\n speech.[11]\n He also lays down definitions of a number of terms, including\ncontinuity. In effect, Aristotle defines continuity as a\nrelation between entities rather than as an\nattribute appertaining to a single entity; that is to say, he\ndoes not provide an explicit definition of the concept of\ncontinuum. He observes that a single continuous whole can be\nbrought into existence by \u201cgluing together\u201d two things\nwhich have been brought into contact, which suggests that the\ncontinuity of a whole should derive from the way its parts\njoin up (see Physics V, 3).  Accordingly for Aristotle\nquantities such as lines and planes, space and time are continuous by\nvirtue of the fact that their constituent parts \u201cjoin together\nat some common boundary\u201d (Catergories, VI [MOMM]).  By\ncontrast no constituent parts of a discrete quantity can\npossess a common boundary.\n\nOne of the central theses Aristotle is at pains to defend is the\nirreducibility of the continuum to discreteness\u2014that a continuum\ncannot be \u201ccomposed\u201d of indivisibles or atoms, parts which\ncannot themselves be further divided.\n\nAristotle sometimes recognizes infinite\ndivisibility\u2014the property of being divisible into parts\nwhich can themselves be further divided, the process never terminating\nin an indivisible\u2014as a consequence of continuity as he\ncharacterizes the notion. But on occasion he takes the property of\ninfinite divisibility as defining continuity. It is this\ndefinition of continuity that figures in Aristotle\u2019s\ndemonstration of what has come to be known as the isomorphism\nthesis, which asserts that either magnitude, time and motion are\nall continuous, or they are all discrete.\n\nThe question of whether magnitude is perpetually divisible into\nsmaller units, or divisible only down to some atomic magnitude leads\nto the dilemma of divisibility (Miller 1982), a difficulty\nthat Aristotle necessarily had to face in connection with his analysis\nof the continuum. In the dilemma\u2019s first, or nihilistic\nhorn, it is argued that, were magnitude everywhere divisible, the\nprocess of carrying out this division completely would reduce a\nmagnitude to extensionless points, or perhaps even to nothingness. The\nsecond, or atomistic, horn starts from the assumption that\nmagnitude is not everywhere divisible and leads to the equally\nunpalatable conclusion (for Aristotle, at least) that indivisible\nmagnitudes must exist.\n\nAs a thoroughgoing materialist,\n Epicurus[12]\n (341\u2013271 BCE) could not accept the notion of potentiality on\nwhich Aristotle\u2019s theory of continuity rested, and so was\npropelled towards atomism in both its conceptual and physical senses.\nLike Leucippus and Democritus, Epicurus felt it necessary to postulate\nthe existence of physical atoms, but to avoid Aristotle\u2019s\nstrictures he proposed that these should not be themselves\nconceptually indivisible, but should contain conceptually\nindivisible parts. Aristotle had shown that a continuous magnitude\ncould not be composed of points, that is, indivisible units\nlacking extension, but he had not shown that an indivisible unit must\nnecessarily lack extension. Epicurus met Aristotle\u2019s argument\nthat a continuum could not be composed of such indivisibles by taking\nindivisibles to be partless units of magnitude possessing\nextension.\n\nIn opposition to the atomists, the Stoic philosophers Zeno of Cition\n(fl. 250 BCE) and Chrysippus (280\u2013206 BCE) upheld the\nAristotelian position that space, time, matter and motion are all\ncontinuous (Sambursky 1954 [1956], 1959; White 1992). And, like\nAristotle, they explicitly rejected any possible existence of void\nwithin the cosmos. The cosmos is pervaded by a continuous invisible\nsubstance which they called pneuma (Greek:\n\u201cbreath\u201d). This pneuma\u2014which was regarded as a kind\nof synthesis of air and fire, two of the four basic elements, the\nothers being earth and water\u2014was conceived as being an elastic\nmedium through which impulses are transmitted by wave motion. All\nphysical occurrences were viewed as being linked through tensile\nforces in the pneuma, and matter itself was held to derive its\nqualities from the \u201cbinding\u201d properties of the pneuma it\ncontains.\n3. The Continuum and the Infinitesimal in the Medieval, Renaissance, and Early Modern Periods\n\nThe scholastic philosophers of Medieval Europe, in thrall to the\nmassive authority of Aristotle, mostly subscribed in one form or\nanother to the thesis, argued with great effectiveness by the Master\nin Book VI of the Physics, that continua cannot be composed\nof indivisibles. On the other hand, the avowed infinitude of the Deity\nof scholastic theology, which ran counter to Aristotle\u2019s thesis\nthat the infinite existed only in a potential sense, emboldened\ncertain of the Schoolmen to speculate that the actual infinite might\nbe found even outside the Godhead, for instance in the assemblage of\npoints on a continuous line. A few scholars of the time, for example\nHenry of Harclay (c. 1275\u20131317) and Nicholas of Autrecourt (c.\n1300\u201369) chose to follow Epicurus in upholding atomism\nreasonable and attempted to circumvent Aristotle\u2019s\ncounterarguments (Pyle 1997).\n\nThis incipient atomism met with a determined synechist rebuttal,\ninitiated by John Duns Scotus (c. 1266\u20131308). In his analysis of\nthe problem of \u201cwhether an angel can move from place to place\nwith a continuous motion\u201d (Opus Oxoniense, see Grant 1974, \u00a752)\nhe offers a pair of purely\ngeometrical arguments against the composition of a continuum out of\nindivisibles. One of these arguments is that if the diagonal and the\nside of a square were both composed of points, then not only would the\ntwo be commensurable in violation of Book X of Euclid, they would even\nbe equal. In the other, two unequal circles are constructed about a\ncommon center, and from the supposition that the larger circle is\ncomposed of points, part of an angle is shown to be equal to the\nwhole, in violation of Euclid\u2019s axiom V.\n\nWilliam of Ockham (c. 1280\u20131349) brought a considerable degree\nof dialectical\n subtlety[13]\n to his analysis of continuity; it has been the subject of much\nscholarly\n dispute.[14]\n For Ockham the principal difficulty presented by the continuous is\nthe infinite divisibility of space, and in general, that of any\ncontinuum. The treatment of continuity in the first book of his\nQuodlibet of 1322\u20137 rests on the idea that between any\ntwo points on a line there is a third\u2014perhaps the first explicit\nformulation of the property of density\u2014and on the\ndistinction between a continuum \u201cwhose parts form a\nunity\u201d (QQ, 510) from a contiguum of juxtaposed\nthings. Ockham recognizes that it follows from the property of density\nthat on arbitrarily small stretches of a line infinitely many points\nmust lie, but resists the conclusion that lines, or indeed any\ncontinuum, consists of points.  Concerned, rather, to determine\n\u201cthe sense in which the line may be said to consist or to be\nmade up of anything\u201d (QQ, 507), Ockham claims that \u201cno\npart of the line is indivisible, nor is any part of a continuum\nindivisible\u201d (QQ, 507). While Ockham does not assert that a line\nis actually \u201ccomposed\u201d of points, he had the insight,\nstartling in its prescience, that a punctate and yet continuous line\nbecomes a possibility when conceived as a dense array of points,\nrather than as an assemblage of points in contiguous succession.\n\nThe most ambitious and systematic attempt at refuting atomism in the\nfourteenth century was mounted by Thomas Bradwardine (c. 1290 \u2013\n1349). The purpose of his Tractatus de Continuo (c. 1330) was\nto \u201cprove that the opinion which maintains continua to be\ncomposed of indivisibles is false\u201d (Murdoch 1957: 54). This was\nto be achieved by setting forth a number of \u201cfirst\nprinciples\u201d concerning the continuum\u2014akin to the axioms\nand postulates of Euclid\u2019s Elements\u2014and then\ndemonstrating that the further assumption that a continuum is composed\nof indivisibles leads to absurdities (Murdoch 1957).\n\nThe views on the continuum of Nicolaus Cusanus (1401\u201364), a\nchampion of the actual infinite, are of considerable interest. In his\nDe Mente Idiotae of 1450, he asserts that any continuum, be\nit geometric, perceptual, or physical, is divisible in two senses, the\none ideal, the other actual. Ideal division \u201cprogresses to\ninfinity\u201d; actual division terminates in atoms after finitely\nmany steps (see Stones 1928: 447).\n\nCusanus\u2019s realist conception of the actual infinite is reflected\nin his quadrature of the circle (Boyer 1939 [1959: 91]). He took the\ncircle to be an infinilateral regular polygon, that is, a\nregular polygon with an infinite number of (infinitesimally short)\nsides. By dividing it up into a correspondingly infinite number of\ntriangles, its area, as for any regular polygon, can be computed as\nhalf the product of the apothem (in this case identical with the\nradius of the circle), and the perimeter. The idea of considering a\ncurve as an infinilateral polygon was employed by a number of later\nthinkers, for instance, Kepler, Galileo and Leibniz.\n\nThe early modern period saw the spread of knowledge in Europe of\nancient geometry, particularly that of Archimedes, and a loosening of\nthe Aristotelian grip on thinking. In regard to the problem of the\ncontinuum, the focus shifted away from metaphysics to technique, from\nthe problem of \u201cwhat indivisibles were, or\nwhether they composed magnitudes\u201d to \u201cthe new\nmarvels one could accomplish with them\u201d (Murdoch 1957:\n325) through the emerging calculus and mathematical analysis. Indeed,\ntracing the development of the continuum concept during this period is\ntantamount to charting the rise of the calculus. Traditionally,\ngeometry is the branch of mathematics concerned with the continuous\nand arithmetic (or algebra) with the discrete. The infinitesimal\ncalculus that took form in the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries,\nwhich had as its primary subject matter continuous variation,\nmay be seen as a kind of synthesis of the continuous and the discrete,\nwith infinitesimals bridging the gap between the two. The widespread\nuse of indivisibles and infinitesimals in the analysis of continuous\nvariation by the mathematicians of the time testifies to the\naffirmation of a kind of mathematical atomism which, while logically\nquestionable, made possible the spectacular mathematical advances with\nwhich the calculus is associated. It was thus to be the infinitesimal,\nrather than the infinite, that served as the mathematical stepping\nstone between the continuous and the discrete.\n\nJohann Kepler (1571\u20131630) made abundant use of infinitesimals in\nhis calculations. In his Nova Stereometria of 1615, a work\nactually written as an aid in calculating the volumes of wine casks,\nhe regards curves as being infinilateral polygons, and solid bodies as\nbeing made up of infinitesimal cones or infinitesimally thin discs\n(Baron 1969 [1987: 108\u2013116]; Boyer 1939 [1959:\n106\u2013110]). Such uses are in keeping with Kepler\u2019s\ncustomary use of infinitesimals of the same dimension as the figures\nthey constitute; but he also used indivisibles on occasion. He spoke,\nfor example, of a cone as being composed of circles, and in\nhis Astronomia Nova of 1609, the work in which he states his\nfamous laws of planetary motion, he takes the area of an ellipse to be\nthe \u201csum of the radii\u201d drawn from the focus.\n\nIt seems to have been Kepler who first introduced the idea, which was\nlater to become a reigning principle in geometry, of continuous\nchange of a mathematical object, in this case, of a geometric\nfigure. In his Astronomiae pars Optica of 1604 Kepler notes\nthat all the conic sections are continuously derivable from one\nanother both through focal motion and by variation of the angle with\nthe cone of the cutting plane.\n\nGalileo Galilei (1564\u20131642) advocated a form of mathematical\natomism in which the influence of both the Democritean atomists and\nthe Aristotelian scholastics can be discerned. This emerges when one\nturns to the First Day of Galileo\u2019s Dialogues Concerning Two\nNew Sciences (1638). Salviati, Galileo\u2019s spokesman,\nmaintains, contrary to Bradwardine and the Aristotelians, that\ncontinuous magnitude is made up of indivisibles, indeed an infinite\nnumber of them. Salviati/Galileo recognizes that this infinity of\nindivisibles will never be produced by successive subdivision, but\nclaims to have a method for generating it all at once, thereby\nremoving it from the realm of the potential into actual realization:\nthis \u201cmethod for separating and resolving the whole of infinity\nat a single stroke\u201d (1638 [NE: 92\u201393; 1914: 48]) turns out\nsimply to the act of bending a straight line into a circle. Here\nGalileo finds an ingenious \u201cmetaphysical\u201d application of\nthe idea of regarding the circle as an infinilateral polygon. When the\nstraight line has been bent into a circle Galileo seems to take it\nthat that the line has thereby been rendered into indivisible parts,\nthat is, points. But if one considers that these parts are the sides\nof the infinilateral polygon, they are better characterized not as\nindivisible points, but rather as unbendable straight lines, each at\nonce part of and tangent to the\n circle.[15]\n Galileo does not mention this possibility, but nevertheless it does\nnot seem fanciful to detect the germ here of the idea of considering a\ncurve as a an assemblage of infinitesimal \u201cunbendable\u201d\nstraight\n lines.[16]\n\nIt was Galileo\u2019s pupil and colleague Bonaventura Cavalieri\n(1598\u20131647) who refined the use of indivisibles into a reliable\nmathematical tool (Boyer 1939 [1959]); indeed the \u201cmethod of\nindivisibles\u201d remains associated with his name to the present\nday. Cavalieri nowhere explains precisely what he understands by the\nword \u201cindivisible\u201d, but it is apparent that he conceived\nof a surface as composed of a multitude of equispaced parallel lines\nand of a volume as composed of equispaced parallel planes, these being\ntermed the indivisibles of the surface and the volume respectively.\nWhile Cavalieri recognized that these \u201cmultitudes\u201d of\nindivisibles must be unboundedly large, indeed was prepared to regard\nthem as being actually infinite, he avoided following Galileo into\nensnarement in the coils of infinity by grasping that, for the\n\u201cmethod of indivisibles\u201d to work, the precise\n\u201cnumber\u201d of indivisibles involved did not matter.\nIndeed, the essence of Cavalieri\u2019s method was the establishing\nof a correspondence between the indivisibles of two\n\u201csimilar\u201d configurations, and in the cases Cavalieri\nconsiders it is evident that the correspondence is suggested on solely\ngeometric grounds, rendering it quite independent of number. The very\nstatement of Cavalieri\u2019s principle embodies this idea: if plane\nfigures are included between a pair of parallel lines, and if their\nintercepts on any line parallel to the including lines are in a fixed\nratio, then the areas of the figures are in the same ratio. (An\nanalogous principle holds for solids.) Cavalieri\u2019s method is in\nessence that of reduction of dimension: solids are reduced to planes\nwith comparable areas and planes to lines with comparable lengths.\nWhile this method suffices for the computation of areas or volumes, it\ncannot be applied to rectify curves, since the reduction in this case\nwould be to points, and no meaning can be attached to the\n\u201cratio\u201d of two points. For rectification a curve has, it\nwas later realized, to be regarded as the sum, not of indivisibles,\nthat is, points, but rather of infinitesimal straight lines, its\nmicrosegments.\n\nRen\u00e9 Descartes (1596\u20131650) employed infinitesimalist\ntechniques, including Cavalieri\u2019s method of indivisibles, in his\nmathematical work. But he avoided the use of infinitesimals in the\ndetermination of tangents to curves, instead developing purely\nalgebraic methods for the purpose. Some of his sharpest criticism was\ndirected at those mathematicians, such as Fermat, who used\ninfinitesimals in the construction of tangents.\n\nAs a philosopher Descartes may be broadly characterized as a\nsynechist. His philosophical system rests on two fundamental\nprinciples: the celebrated Cartesian dualism\u2014the division\nbetween mind and matter\u2014and the less familiar identification of\nmatter and spatial extension. In the Meditations Descartes\ndistinguishes mind and matter on the grounds that the corporeal, being\nspatially extended, is divisible, while the mental is partless. The\nidentification of matter and spatial extension has the consequence\nthat matter is continuous and divisible without limit. Since extension\nis the sole essential property of matter and, conversely, matter\nalways accompanies extension, matter must be ubiquitous.\nDescartes\u2019 space is accordingly, as it was for the Stoics, a\nplenum pervaded by a continuous medium.\n\nThe concept of infinitesimal had arisen with problems of a geometric\ncharacter and infinitesimals were originally conceived as belonging\nsolely to the realm of continuous magnitude as opposed to that of\ndiscrete number. But from the algebra and analytic geometry of the\nsixteenth and seventeenth centuries there issued the concept of\ninfinitesimal number. The idea first appears in the work of\nPierre de Fermat (1601\u201365) on the determination of maximum and\nminimum (extreme) values, published in 1638 (Boyer 1939 [1959: 155]).\n\nFermat\u2019s treatment of maxima and minima contains the germ of the\nfertile technique of \u201cinfinitesimal variation\u201d, that is,\nthe investigation of the behavior of a function by subjecting its\nvariables to small changes. Fermat applied this method in determining\ntangents to curves and centers of gravity.\n4. The Continuum and the Infinitesimal in the Seventeenth and Eighteenth Centuries\n\nIsaac\n Barrow[17]\n (1630\u201377) was one of the first mathematicians to grasp the\nreciprocal relation between the problem of quadrature and that of\nfinding tangents to curves\u2014in modern parlance, between\nintegration and differentiation. In his Lectiones Geometricae\nof 1670, Barrow observes, in essence, that if the quadrature of a\ncurve \\(y = f(x)\\) is known, with the area up to \\(x\\) given by\n\\(F(x)\\), then the subtangent to the curve \\(y = F(x)\\) is measured by\nthe ratio of its ordinate to the ordinate of the original curve.\n\nBarrow, a thoroughgoing synechist, regarded the conflict between\ndivisionism and atomism as a live issue, and presented a number of\narguments against mathematical atomism, the strongest of which is that\natomism contradicts many of the basic propositions of Euclidean\ngeometry.\n\nBarrow conceived of continuous magnitudes as being generated by\nmotions, and so necessarily dependent on time, a view that seems to\nhave had a strong influence on the thinking of his illustrious pupil\nIsaac\n Newton[18]\n (1642\u20131727). Newton\u2019s meditations during the plague year\n1665\u201366 issued in the invention of what he called the\n\u201cCalculus of Fluxions\u201d, the principles and methods of\nwhich were presented in three tracts published many years after they\nwere written: De analysi per aequationes numero terminorum\ninfinitas; Methodus fluxionum et serierum infinitarum;\nand De quadratura curvarum. Newton\u2019s approach to the\ncalculus rests, even more firmly than did Barrow\u2019s, on the\nconception of continua as being generated by motion.\n\nBut Newton\u2019s exploitation of the kinematic conception went much\ndeeper than had Barrow\u2019s. In De Analysi, for example,\nNewton introduces a notation for the \u201cmomentary increment\u201d\n(moment)\u2014evidently meant to represent a moment or\ninstant of time\u2014of the abscissa or the area of a curve, with the\nabscissa itself representing time. This\n\u201cmoment\u201d\u2014effectively the same as the infinitesimal\nquantities previously introduced by Fermat and Barrow\u2014Newton\ndenotes by \\(o\\) in the case of the abscissa, and by \\(ov\\) in the\ncase of the area. From the fact that Newton uses the letter \\(v\\) for\nthe ordinate, it may be inferred that Newton is thinking of the curve\nas being a graph of velocity against time. By considering the moving\nline, or ordinate, as the moment of the area Newton established the\ngenerality of and reciprocal relationship between the operations of\ndifferentiation and integration, a fact that Barrow had grasped but\nhad not put to systematic use. Before Newton, quadrature or\nintegration had rested ultimately \u201con some process through which\nelemental triangles or rectangles were added together\u201d (Baron\n1969 [1987: 268]), that is, on the method of indivisibles.\nNewton\u2019s explicit treatment of integration as inverse\ndifferentiation was the key to the integral calculus.\n\nIn the Methodus fluxionum Newton makes explicit his\nconception of variable quantities as generated by motions, and\nintroduces his characteristic notation. He calls the quantity\ngenerated by a motion a fluent, and its rate of generation a\nfluxion. The fluxion of a fluent \\(x\\) is denoted by\n\\(\\dot{x}\\), and its moment, or \u201cinfinitely small increment\naccruing in an infinitely short time \\(o\\)\u201d, by \\(\\dot{x}\no\\). The problem of determining a tangent to a curve is transformed\ninto the problem of finding the relationship between the fluxions\n\\(\\dot{x}\\) and \\(\\dot{z}\\) when presented with an equation\nrepresenting the relationship between the fluents \\(x\\) and \\(z\\). (A\nquadrature is the inverse problem, that of determining the fluents\nwhen the fluxions are given.) Thus, for example, in the case of the\nfluent \\(z = x^n\\), Newton first forms \\(\\dot{z} + \\dot{z} o =\n(\\dot{x} + \\dot{x} o)^n\\), expands the right-hand side using the\nbinomial theorem, subtracts \\(z = x^n\\), divides through by \\(o\\),\nneglects all terms still containing \\(o\\), and so obtains \\(\\dot{z} =\nnx^{n-1} \\dot{x}\\).\n\nNewton later became discontented with the undeniable presence of\ninfinitesimals in his calculus, and dissatisfied with the dubious\nprocedure of \u201cneglecting\u201d them. In the preface to\nthe De quadratura curvarum he remarks that there is no\nnecessity to introduce into the method of fluxions any argument about\ninfinitely small quantities. In their place he proposes to employ what\nhe calls the method of prime and ultimate ratio. This method,\nin many respects an anticipation of the limit concept, receives a\nnumber of allusions in Newton\u2019s celebrated Principia\nmathematica philosophiae naturalis of 1687.\n\nNewton developed three approaches for his calculus, all of which he\nregarded as leading to equivalent results, but which varied in their\ndegree of rigor. The first employed infinitesimal quantities which,\nwhile not finite, are at the same time not exactly zero. Finding that\nthese eluded precise formulation, Newton focussed instead on their\nratio, which is in general a finite number. If this ratio is known,\nthe infinitesimal quantities forming it may be replaced by any\nsuitable finite magnitudes\u2014such as velocities or\nfluxions\u2014having the same ratio. This is the method of fluxions.\nRecognizing that this method itself required a foundation, Newton\nsupplied it with one in the form of the doctrine of prime and ultimate\nratios, a kinematic form of the theory of limits.\n\nThe philosopher-mathematician G. W. F.\n Leibniz[19]\n (1646\u20131716) was greatly preoccupied with the problem of the\ncomposition of the continuum\u2014the \u201clabyrinth of the\ncontinuum\u201d, as he called it. Indeed we have it on his own\ntestimony that his philosophical\nsystem\u2014monadism\u2014grew from his struggle with the\nproblem of just how, or whether, a continuum can be built from\nindivisible elements. Leibniz asked himself: if we grant that each\nreal entity is either a simple unity or a multiplicity, and that a\nmultiplicity is necessarily an aggregation of unities, then under what\nhead should a geometric continuum such as a line be classified? Now a\nline is extended and Leibniz held that extension is a form of\nrepetition, so, a line, being divisible into parts, cannot be a (true)\nunity. It is then a multiplicity, and accordingly an aggregation of\nunities. But of what sort of unities? Seemingly, the only candidates\nfor geometric unities are points, but points are no more than\nextremities of the extended, and in any case, as Leibniz knew, solid\narguments going back to Aristotle establish that no continuum can be\nconstituted from points. It follows that a continuum is neither a\nunity nor an aggregation of unities. Leibniz concluded that continua\nare not real entities at all; as \u201cwholes preceding\ntheir parts\u201d they have instead a purely ideal character. In this\nway he freed the continuum from the requirement that, as something\nintelligible, it must itself be simple or a compound of simples.\n\nLeibniz held that space and time, as continua, are ideal, and anything\nreal, in particular matter, is discrete, compounded of simple unit\nsubstances he termed monads.\n\nAmong the best known of Leibniz\u2019s doctrines is the\nPrinciple or Law of Continuity. In a somewhat\nnebulous form this principle had been employed on occasion by a number\nof Leibniz\u2019s predecessors, including Cusanus and Kepler, but it\nwas Leibniz who gave to the principle \n\n\na clarity of formulation which had previously been lacking and perhaps\nfor this reason regarded it as his own discovery. (Boyer 1939 [1959:\n217]) \n\n\nIn a letter to Bayle of 1687, Leibniz gave the following formulation\nof the principle: \n\n\nin any supposed transition, ending in any terminus, it is permissible\nto institute a general reasoning in which the final terminus may be\nincluded. (quoted in Boyer 1939 [1959: 217] which cites Leibniz,\nEarly Mathematical Manuscripts, p. 147)\n\n\nThis would seem to indicate that Leibniz considered\n\u201ctransitions\u201d of any kind as continuous. Certainly he held\nthis to be the case in geometry and for natural processes, where it\nappears as the principle Natura non facit saltus. According\nto Leibniz, it is the Law of Continuity that allows geometry and the\nevolving methods of the infinitesimal calculus to be applicable in\nphysics. The Principle of Continuity also furnished the chief grounds\nfor Leibniz\u2019s rejection of material atomism.\n\nThe Principle of Continuity also played an important underlying role\nin Leibniz\u2019s mathematical work, especially in his development of\nthe infinitesimal calculus. Leibniz\u2019s essays Nova\nMethodus of 1684 and De Geometria Recondita of 1686 may\nbe said to represent the official births of the differential and\nintegral calculi, respectively. His approach to the calculus, in which\nthe use of infinitesimals, plays a central role, has combinatorial\nroots, traceable to his early work on derived sequences of numbers.\nGiven a curve determined by correlated variables \\(x, y\\), he wrote\n\\(\\Dx\\) and \\(\\Dy\\) for infinitesimal differences, or\ndifferentials, between the values \\(x\\) and \\(y\\): and\n\\(\\Dy/\\Dx\\) for the ratio of the two, which he then took to represent\nthe slope of the curve at the corresponding point. This suggestive, if\nhighly formal procedure led Leibniz to evolve rules for calculating\nwith differentials, which was achieved by appropriate modification of\nthe rules of calculation for ordinary numbers.\n\nAlthough the use of infinitesimals was instrumental in Leibniz\u2019s\napproach to the calculus, in 1684 he introduced the concept of\ndifferential without mentioning infinitely small quantities, almost\ncertainly in order to avoid foundational difficulties. He states\nwithout proof the following rules of differentiation:\n\n\nIf \\(a\\) is constant, then  \n\n\\[\n\\begin{align}\n\\D a & = 0\\\\\n\\D (ax) & = a \\Dx\\\\\n\\D (x+y-z) & = \\Dx  + \\Dy  - \\D z\\\\\n\\D (xy)  & = x \\Dy  + y \\Dx  \\\\\n\\D (x/y) & = \\frac{[- x \\Dy  + y \\Dx ]}{y^2}\\\\\n\\D (x^p) & = px^{p-1}\\Dx\\text{, also for fractional \\(p\\)}\\\\\n\\end{align}\n\\]\n\n\n\nBut behind the formal beauty of these rules\u2014an early\nmanifestation of what was later to flower into differential\nalgebra\u2014the presence of infinitesimals makes itself felt, since\nLeibniz\u2019s definition of tangent employs both infinitely small\ndistances and the conception of a curve as an infinilateral\npolygon.\n\nLeibniz conceived of differentials \\(\\Dx , \\Dy\\) as variables ranging\nover differences. This enabled him to take the important step of\nregarding the symbol \\(\\D\\) as an operator acting on\nvariables, so paving the way for the iterated application of\n\\(\\D \\), leading to the higher differentials \\(\\D\\Dx = \\D^2 x\\),\n\\(\\D^3 x = \\D\\D^2 x\\), and in general \\(\\D^{n+1}x = \\D\\D^{n}x\\).\nLeibniz supposed that the first-order differentials \\(\\Dx\\),\n\\(\\Dy\\),\u2026. were incomparably smaller than, or infinitesimal\nwith respect to, the finite quantities \\(x\\), \\(y\\),\u2026, and, in\ngeneral, that an analogous relation obtained between the\n\\((n+1)^{\\textrm{th}}\\)-order differentials \\(\\D^{n+1}x\\) and the\n\\(n^{\\textrm{th}}\\)-order differentials \\(\\D^n x\\). He also assumed\nthat the \\(n^{\\textrm{th}}\\) power \\((\\Dx )^n\\) of a first-order\ndifferential was of the same order of magnitude as an\n\\(n^{\\textrm{th}}\\)-order differential \\(\\D^{n} x\\), in the sense that\nthe quotient \\(\\D^{n} x/(\\Dx )^n\\) is a finite quantity.\n\nFor Leibniz the incomparable smallness of infinitesimals derived from\ntheir failure to satisfy Archimedes\u2019 principle; and quantities\ndiffering only by an infinitesimal were to be considered equal. But\nwhile infinitesimals were conceived by Leibniz to be incomparably\nsmaller than ordinary numbers, the Law of Continuity ensured that they\nwere governed by the same laws as the latter.\n\nLeibniz\u2019s attitude toward infinitesimals and differentials seems\nto have been that they furnished the elements from which to fashion a\nformal grammar, an algebra, of the continuous. Since he regarded\ncontinua as purely ideal entities, it was then perfectly consistent\nfor him to maintain, as he did, that infinitesimal quantities\nthemselves are no less ideal\u2014simply useful fictions, introduced\nto shorten arguments and aid insight.\n\nAlthough Leibniz himself did not credit the infinitesimal or the\n(mathematical) infinite with objective existence, a number of his\nfollowers did not hesitate to do so. Among the most prominent of these\nwas Johann Bernoulli (1667\u20131748). A letter of his to Leibniz\nwritten in 1698 contains the forthright assertion that \u201cinasmuch\nas the number of terms in nature is infinite, the infinitesimal exists\nipso facto\u201d (Boyer 1939 [1959: 239], quoting Leibniz,\nMathematische Schriften, III (Part 2), 555). One of his\narguments for the existence of actual infinitesimals begins with the\npositing of the infinite sequence 1/2, 1/3, 1/4,\u2026. If there are\nten terms, one tenth exists; if a hundred, then a hundredth exists,\netc.; and so if, as postulated, the number of terms is infinite, then\nthe infinitesimal exists.\n\nLeibniz\u2019s calculus gained a wide audience through the\npublication in 1696, by Guillaume de L\u2019H\u00f4pital\n(1661\u20131704), of the first expository book on the subject, the\nAnalyse des Infiniments Petits Pour L\u2019Intelligence des\nLignes Courbes. This is based on two definitions:\n\nVariable quantities are those that continually increase or\ndecrease; and constant or standing quantities are those that continue\nthe same while others vary.\nThe infinitely small part whereby a variable quantity is\ncontinually increased or decreased is called the differential of that\nquantity.\n\n\nAnd two postulates:\n\nGrant that two quantities, whose difference is an infinitely small\nquantity, may be taken (or used) indifferently for each other: or\n(what is the same thing) that a quantity, which is increased or\ndecreased only by an infinitely small quantity, may be considered as\nremaining the same.\nGrant that a curve line may be considered as the assemblage of an\ninfinite number of infinitely small right lines: or (what is the same\nthing) as a polygon with an infinite number of sides, each of an\ninfinitely small length, which determine the curvature of the line by\nthe angles they make with each other.\n\n\nFollowing Leibniz, L\u2019H\u00f4pital writes \\(\\Dx\\) for the\ndifferential of a variable quantity \\(x\\). A typical application of\nthese definitions and postulates is the determination of the\ndifferential of a product \\(xy\\): \n\n\\[\n\\begin{align}\n\\D (xy) & = (x + \\Dx )(y +\\Dy ) - xy \\\\\n& = y \\Dx  + x \\Dy  + \\Dx  \\Dy  \\\\\n& = y \\Dx  + x \\Dy .\\\\\n\\end{align}\n\\]\n\n\nHere the last step is justified by Postulate I, since \\(\\Dx \\Dy\\) is\ninfinitely small in comparison to \\(y \\Dx + x \\Dy\\).\n\nLeibniz\u2019s calculus of differentials, resting as it did on\nsomewhat insecure foundations, soon attracted criticism. The attack\nmounted by the Dutch physician Bernard\n Nieuwentijdt[20]\n (1654\u20131718) in works of 1694\u20136  is of particular interest,\nsince Nieuwentijdt offered his own account of infinitesimals which\nconflicts with that of Leibniz and has striking features of its own\n(see Mancosu 1996: 158\u2013160).  Nieuwentijdt postulates a domain\nof quantities, or numbers, subject to a ordering relation of greater\nor less. This domain includes the ordinary finite quantities, but it\nis also presumed to contain infinitesimal and infinite\nquantities\u2014a quantity being infinitesimal, or infinite, when it\nis smaller, or, respectively, greater, than any arbitrarily given\nfinite quantity. The whole domain is governed by a version of the\nArchimedean principle to the effect that zero is the only quantity\nincapable of being multiplied sufficiently many times to equal any\ngiven quantity. Infinitesimal quantities may be characterized as\nquotients \\(b/m\\) of a finite quantity \\(b\\) by an infinite quantity\n\\(m\\). In contrast with Leibniz\u2019s differentials,\nNieuwentijdt\u2019s infinitesimals have the property that the product\nof any pair of them vanishes; in particular each infinitesimal is\nnilsquare, i.e., its square and all higher powers are zero\n(see Mancosu 1996: 159). This fact enables Nieuwentijdt to show that,\nfor any curve given by an algebraic equation, the hypotenuse of the\ndifferential triangle generated by an infinitesimal abscissal\nincrement \\(e\\) coincides with the segment of the curve between \\(x\\)\nand \\(x + e\\). That is, a curve truly is an infinilateral\npolygon.\n\nThe major differences between Nieuwentijdt\u2019s and Leibniz\u2019s\ncalculi of infinitesimals are summed up in the following table:\n\n\nLeibniz\nNieuwentijdt \n\nInfinitesimals are variables\nInfinitesimals are constants \n\nHigher-order infinitesimals exist\nHigher-order infinitesimals do not exist \n\nProducts of infinitesimals are not absolute zeros\nProducts of infinitesimals are absolute zeros \n\nInfinitesimals can be neglected when infinitely small with\nrespect to other quantities\n(First-order) infinitesimals can never be neglected \n\n\nIn responding to Nieuwentijdt\u2019s assertion that squares and\nhigher powers of infinitesimals vanish, Leibniz objected that it is\nrather strange to posit that a segment \\(\\Dx\\) is different from zero\nand at the same time that the area of a square with side \\(\\Dx\\) is\nequal to zero (Mancosu 1996: 161). Yet this oddity may be regarded as\na consequence\u2014apparently unremarked by Leibniz himself\u2014of\none of his own key principles, namely that curves may be considered as\ninfinilateral polygons. Consider, for instance, the curve \\(y = x^2\\).\nGiven that the curve is an infinilateral polygon, the infinitesimal\nstraight stretch of the curve between the abscissae 0 and \\(\\Dx\\) must\ncoincide with the tangent to the curve at the origin\u2014in this\ncase, the axis of abscissae\u2014between these two points. But then\nthe point \\((\\Dx , \\Dx ^2)\\) must lie on the axis of abscissae, which\nmeans that \\(\\Dx ^2 = 0\\).\n\nNow Leibniz could retort that that this argument depends crucially on\nthe assumption that the portion of the curve between abscissae 0 and\n\\(\\Dx\\) is indeed straight. If this be denied, then of course it does\nnot follow that \\(\\Dx ^2 = 0\\). But if one grants, as Leibniz does,\nthat that there is an infinitesimal straight stretch of the curve (a\nside, that is, of an infinilateral polygon coinciding with the curve)\nbetween abscissae 0 and \\(e\\), say, which does not reduce to a single\npoint then \\(e\\) cannot be equated to 0 and yet the above argument\nshows that \\(e^2 = 0\\). It follows that, if curves are infinilateral\npolygons, then the \u201clengths\u201d of the sides of these latter\nmust be nilsquare infinitesimals. Accordingly, to do full justice to\nLeibniz\u2019s (as well as Nieuwentijdt\u2019s) conception,\ntwo sorts of infinitesimals are required: first,\n\u201cdifferentials\u201d obeying\u2014as laid down by\nLeibniz\u2014the same algebraic laws as finite quantities; and second\nthe (necessarily smaller) nilsquare infinitesimals which measure the\nlengths of the sides of infinilateral polygons. It may be said that\nLeibniz recognized the need for the first, but not the second type of\ninfinitesimal and Nieuwentijdt, vice-versa. It is of interest to note\nthat Leibnizian infinitesimals (differentials) are realized in\nnonstandard analysis, and nilsquare infinitesimals in smooth\ninfinitesimal analysis (for both types of analysis see below). In fact\nit has been shown to be possible to combine the two approaches, so\ncreating an analytic framework realizing both Leibniz\u2019s and\nNieuwentijdt\u2019s conceptions of infinitesimal.\n\nThe insistence that infinitesimals obey precisely the same algebraic\nrules as finite quantities forced Leibniz and the defenders of his\ndifferential calculus into treating infinitesimals, in the presence of\nfinite quantities, as if they were zeros, so that, for\nexample, \\(x + \\Dx\\) is treated as if it were the same as \\(x\\). This\nwas justified on the grounds that differentials are to be taken as\nvariable, not fixed quantities, decreasing continually until reaching\nzero. Considered only in the \u201cmoment of their\nevanescence\u201d, they were accordingly neither something nor\nabsolute zeros.\n\nThus differentials (or infinitesimals) \\(\\Dx\\) were ascribed variously\nthe four following properties:\n\n\\(\\Dx \\approx 0\\)\nneither \\(\\Dx = 0\\) nor \\(\\Dx \\ne 0\\)\n\\(\\Dx ^2 = 0\\)\n\\(\\Dx \\rightarrow 0\\)\n\n\nwhere \u201c\\(\\approx\\)\u201d stands for \u201cindistinguishable\nfrom\u201d, and \u201c\\(\\rightarrow 0\\)\u201d stands for\n\u201cbecomes vanishingly small\u201d. Of these properties only the\nlast, in which a differential is considered to be a variable quantity\ntending to 0, survived the nineteenth century refounding of the\ncalculus in terms of the limit\n concept.[21]\n\nThe leading practitioner of the calculus, indeed the leading\nmathematician of the eighteenth century, was Leonhard\n Euler[22]\n (1707\u201383). Philosophically Euler was a thoroughgoing synechist.\nRejecting Leibnizian monadism, he favored the Cartesian doctrine that\nthe universe is filled with a continuous ethereal fluid and upheld the\nwave theory of light over the corpuscular theory propounded by\nNewton.\n\nEuler rejected the concept of infinitesimal in its sense as a quantity\nless than any assignable magnitude and yet unequal to 0, arguing: that\ndifferentials must be zeros, and \\(\\Dy/\\Dx\\) the quotient \\(0/0\\).\nSince for any number \\(\\alpha\\), \\(\\alpha \\cdot 0 = 0\\), Euler\nmaintained that the quotient \\(0/0\\) could represent any number\n whatsoever.[23]\n For Euler qua formalist the calculus was essentially a\nprocedure for determining the value of the expression \\(0/0\\) in the\nmanifold situations it arises as the ratio of evanescent\nincrements.\n\nBut in the mathematical analysis of natural phenomena, Euler, along\nwith a number of his contemporaries, did employ what amount to\ninfinitesimals in the form of minute, but more or less concrete\n\u201celements\u201d of continua, treating them not as atoms or\nmonads in the strict sense\u2014as parts of a continuum they must of\nnecessity be divisible\u2014but as being of sufficient minuteness to\npreserve their rectilinear shape under infinitesimal flow,\nyet allowing their volume to undergo infinitesimal change.\nThis idea was to become fundamental in continuum mechanics.\n\nWhile Euler treated infinitesimals as formal zeros, that is, as fixed\nquantities, his contemporary Jean le Rond d\u2019Alembert\n(1717\u201383) took a different view of the matter. Following\nNewton\u2019s lead, he conceived of infinitesimals or differentials\nin terms of the limit concept, which he formulated by the assertion\nthat one varying quantity is the limit of another if the second can\napproach the other more closely than by any given quantity.\nD\u2019Alembert firmly rejected the idea of infinitesimals as fixed\nquantities, and saw the idea of limit as supplying the methodological\nroot of the differential calculus. For d\u2019Alembert the language\nof infinitesimals or differentials was just a convenient shorthand for\navoiding the cumbrousness of expression required by the use of the\nlimit concept.\n\nInfinitesimals, differentials, evanescent quantities and the like\ncoursed through the veins of the calculus throughout the eighteenth\ncentury. Although nebulous\u2014even logically suspect\u2014these\nconcepts provided, faute de mieux, the tools for deriving the\ngreat wealth of results the calculus had made possible. And while,\nwith the notable exception of Euler, many eighteenth century\nmathematicians were ill-at-ease with the infinitesimal, they would not\nrisk killing the goose laying such a wealth of golden mathematical\neggs. Accordingly they refrained, in the main, from destructive\ncriticism of the ideas underlying the calculus. Philosophers, however,\nwere not fettered by such constraints.\n\nThe philosopher George Berkeley (1685\u20131753), noted both for his\nsubjective idealist doctrine of esse est percipi and his\ndenial of general ideas, was a persistent critic of the\npresuppositions underlying the mathematical practice of his day\n(Jesseph 1993). His most celebrated broadsides were directed at the\ncalculus, but in fact his conflict with the mathematicians went\ndeeper. For his denial of the existence of abstract ideas of any kind\nwent in direct opposition with the abstractionist account of\nmathematical concepts held by the majority of mathematicians and\nphilosophers of the day. The central tenet of this doctrine, which\ngoes back to Aristotle, is that the mind creates mathematical concepts\nby abstraction, that is, by the mental suppression of\nextraneous features of perceived objects so as to focus on properties\nsingled out for attention. Berkeley rejected this, asserting that\nmathematics as a science is ultimately concerned with objects of\nsense, its admitted generality stemming from the capacity of percepts\nto serve as signs for all percepts of a similar form.\n\nAt first Berkeley poured scorn on those who adhere to the concept of\ninfinitesimal. maintaining that the use of infinitesimals in deriving\nmathematical results is illusory, and is in fact eliminable. But later\nhe came to adopt a more tolerant attitude towards infinitesimals,\nregarding them as useful fictions in somewhat the same way as did\nLeibniz.\n\nIn The Analyst of 1734 Berkeley launched his most sustained\nand sophisticated critique of infinitesimals and the whole metaphysics\nof the calculus. Addressed To an Infidel\n Mathematician,[24]\n the tract was written with the avowed purpose of defending theology\nagainst the scepticism shared by many of the mathematicians and\nscientists of the day. Berkeley\u2019s defense of religion amounts to\nthe claim that the reasoning of mathematicians in respect of the\ncalculus is no less flawed than that of theologians in respect of the\nmysteries of the divine.\n\nBerkeley\u2019s arguments are directed chiefly against the Newtonian\nfluxional calculus. Typical of his objections is that in attempting to\navoid infinitesimals by the employment of such devices as evanescent\nquantities and prime and ultimate ratios Newton has in fact violated\nthe law of noncontradiction by first subjecting a quantity to an\nincrement and then setting the increment to 0, that is, denying that\nan increment had ever been present. As for fluxions and evanescent\nincrements themselves, Berkeley has this to say:\n\n\nAnd what are these fluxions? The velocities of evanescent increments?\nAnd what are these same evanescent increments? They are neither finite\nquantities nor quantities infinitely small, nor yet nothing. May we\nnot call them the ghosts of departed quantities? (1734: 59)\n\n\nNor did the Leibnizian method of differentials escape Berkeley\u2019s\nstrictures.\n\nThe opposition between continuity and discreteness plays a significant\nrole in the philosophical thought of Immanuel Kant (1724\u20131804).\nHis mature philosophy, transcendental idealism, rests on the\ndivision of reality into two realms. The first, the\nphenomenal realm, consists of appearances or objects of\npossible experience, configured by the forms of sensibility and the\nepistemic categories. The second, the noumenal realm,\nconsists of \u201centities of the understanding to which no objects\nof experience can ever correspond\u201d (K\u00f6rner 1955: 94), that\nis, things-in-themselves.\n\nRegarded as magnitudes, appearances are spatiotemporally extended and\ncontinuous, that is infinitely, or at least limitlessly, divisible.\nSpace and time constitute the underlying order of phenomena, so are\nultimately phenomenal themselves, and hence also continuous.\n\nAs objects of knowledge, appearances are continuous extensive\nmagnitudes, but as objects of sensation or perception they are,\naccording to Kant, intensive magnitudes. By an intensive\nmagnitude Kant means a magnitude possessing a degree and so\ncapable of being apprehended by the senses: for example brightness or\ntemperature. Intensive magnitudes are entirely free of the intuitions\nof space or time, and \u201ccan only be presented as\nunities\u201d. But, like extensive magnitudes, they are\ncontinuous. Moreover, appearances are always presented to the senses\nas intensive magnitudes.\n\nIn the Critique of Pure Reason (1781) Kant brings a new\nsubtlety (and, it must be said, tortuousity) to the analysis of the\nopposition between continuity and discreteness. This may be seen in\nthe second of the celebrated Antinomies in that work, which concerns\nthe question of the mereological composition of matter, or extended\nsubstance. Is it (a) discrete, that is, consists of simple or\nindivisible parts, or (b) continuous, that is, contains parts within\nparts ad infinitum? Although (a), which Kant calls the\nThesis and (b) the Antithesis would seem to\ncontradict one another, Kant offers proofs of both assertions. The\nresulting contradiction may be resolved, he asserts, by observing that\nwhile the antinomy \u201crelates to the division of\nappearances\u201d, the arguments for (a) and (b) implicitly treat\nmatter or substance as things-in-themselves. Kant concludes that both\nThesis and Antithesis \u201cpresuppose an inadmissible\ncondition\u201d and accordingly \u201cboth fall to the ground,\ninasmuch as the condition, under which alone either of them can be\nmaintained, itself falls\u201d.\n\nKant identifies the inadmissible condition as the implicit taking of\nmatter as a thing-in-itself, which in turn leads to the mistake of\ntaking the division of matter into parts to subsist independently of\nthe act of dividing. In that case, the Thesis implies that the\nsequence of divisions is finite; the Antithesis, that it is infinite.\nThese cannot both be true of the completed (or at least\ncompletable) sequence of divisions which would result from taking\nmatter or substance as a\n thing-in-itself.[25]\n Now since the truth of both assertions has been shown to follow from\nthat assumption, it must be false, that is, matter and\nextended substance are appearances only. And for appearances, Kant\nmaintains, divisions into parts are not completable in experience,\nwith the result that such divisions can be considered, in a startling\nphrase, \u201cneither finite nor infinite\u201d.  It follows that,\nfor appearances, both Thesis and Antithesis are false.\n\nLater in the Critique Kant enlarges on the issue of\ndivisibility, asserting that, while each part generated by a sequence\nof divisions of an intuited whole is given with the whole, the\nsequence\u2019s incompletability prevents it from forming a\nwhole; a fortiori no such sequence can be claimed to be\nactually infinite.\n5. The Continuum and the Infinitesimal in the Nineteenth Century\n\nThe rapid development of mathematical analysis in the eighteenth\ncentury had not concealed the fact that its underlying concepts not\nonly lacked rigorous definition, but were even (e.g., in the case of\ndifferentials and infinitesimals) of doubtful logical character. The\nlack of precision in the notion of continuous function\u2014still\nvaguely understood as one which could be represented by a formula and\nwhose associated curve could be smoothly drawn\u2014had led to doubts\nconcerning the validity of a number of procedures in which that\nconcept figured. For example it was often assumed that every\ncontinuous function could be expressed as an infinite series by means\nof Taylor\u2019s theorem. Early in the nineteenth century this and\nother assumptions began to be questioned, thereby initiating an\ninquiry into what was meant by a function in general and by a\ncontinuous function in particular.\n\nA pioneer in the matter of clarifying the concept of continuous\nfunction was the Bohemian priest, philosopher and mathematician\nBernard Bolzano (1781\u20131848). In his Rein analytischer\nBeweis of 1817 he defines a (real-valued) function \\(f\\) to be\ncontinuous at a point \\(x\\) if the difference \\(f(x + \\omega) - f(x)\\)\ncan be made smaller than any preselected quantity once we are\npermitted to take \\(w\\) as small as we please. This is essentially the\nsame as the definition of continuity in terms of the limit concept\ngiven a little later by Cauchy. Bolzano also formulated a definition\nof the derivative of a function free of the notion of infinitesimal\n(Bolzano 1851 [1950]). Bolzano repudiated Euler\u2019s treatment of\ndifferentials as formal zeros in expressions such as \\(\\Dy/\\Dx\\),\nsuggesting instead that in determining the derivative of a function,\nincrements \\(\\Delta x,\\) \\(\\Delta y,\\) \u2026, be finally\nset to zero. For Bolzano differentials have the status of\nideal elements, purely formal entities such as points and\nlines at infinity in projective geometry, or (as Bolzano himself\nmentions) imaginary numbers, whose use will never lead to false\nassertions concerning real quantities.\n\nAlthough Bolzano anticipated the form that the rigorous formulation of\nthe concepts of the calculus would assume, his work was largely\nignored in his lifetime. The cornerstone for the rigorous development\nof the calculus was supplied by the ideas\u2014essentially similar to\nBolzano\u2019s\u2014of the great French mathematician Augustin-Louis\nCauchy (1789\u20131857). In Cauchy\u2019s work, as in\nBolzano\u2019s, a central role is played by a purely arithmetical\nconcept of limit freed of all geometric and temporal intuition. Cauchy\nalso formulates the condition for a sequence of real numbers to\nconverge to a limit, and states his familiar criterion for\n convergence,[26]\n namely, that a sequence \\(\\langle s_n\\rangle\\) is convergent if and\nonly if \\(s_{n+r} - s_n\\) can be made less in absolute value than any\npreassigned quantity for all \\(r\\) and sufficiently large \\(n\\).\nCauchy proves that this is necessary for convergence, but as to\nsufficiency of the condition merely remarks \u201cwhen the various\nconditions are fulfilled, the convergence of the series is\nassured\u201d (Kline 1972: 951). In making this latter assertion he\nis implicitly appealing to geometric intuition, since he makes no\nattempt to define real numbers, observing only that irrational numbers\nare to be regarded as the limits of sequences of rational numbers.\n\nCauchy chose to characterize the continuity of functions in terms of a\nrigorized notion of infinitesimal, which he defines in the Cours\nd\u2019analyse as \u201ca variable quantity [whose value]\ndecreases indefinitely in such a way as to converge to the limit\n0\u201d (Kline 1972: 951). Here is his definition of\ncontinuity. Cauchy\u2019s definition of continuity of \\(f(x)\\) in the\nneighborhood of a value \\(a\\) amounts to the condition, in modern\nnotation, that \\(\\lim_{x\\rightarrow a}f(x) = f(a)\\). Cauchy defines\nthe derivative \\(f '(x)\\) of a function \\(f(x)\\) in a manner\nessentially identical to that of Bolzano.\n\nThe work of Cauchy (as well as that of Bolzano) represents a crucial\nstage in the renunciation by mathematicians\u2014adumbrated in the\nwork of d\u2019Alembert\u2014of (fixed) infinitesimals and the\nintuitive ideas of continuity and motion. Certain mathematicians of\nthe day, such as Poisson and Cournot, who regarded the limit concept\nas no more than a circuitous substitute for the use of infinitesimally\nsmall magnitudes\u2014which in any case (they claimed) had a real\nexistence\u2014felt that Cauchy\u2019s reforms had been carried too\nfar. But traces of the traditional ideas did in fact remain in\nCauchy\u2019s formulations, as evidenced by his use of such\nexpressions as \u201cvariable quantities\u201d, \u201cinfinitesimal\nquantities\u201d, \u201capproach indefinitely\u201d, \u201cas\nlittle as one wishes\u201d (Kline 1972: 951) and the\n like.[27]\n\nMeanwhile the German mathematician Karl Weierstrass (1815\u201397)\nwas completing the banishment of spatiotemporal intuition, and the\ninfinitesimal, from the foundations of analysis. To instill complete\nlogical rigor Weierstrass proposed to establish mathematical analysis\non the basis of number alone, to\n \u201carithmetize\u201d[28]\n it\u2014in effect, to replace the continuous by the discrete.\n\u201cArithmetization\u201d may be seen as a form of mathematical\natomism. In pursuit of this goal Weierstrass had first to formulate a\nrigorous \u201carithmetical\u201d definition of real number. He did\nthis by defining a (positive) real number to be a countable set of\npositive rational numbers for which the sum of any finite subset\nalways remains below some preassigned bound, and then specifying the\nconditions under which two such \u201creal numbers\u201d are to be\nconsidered equal, or strictly less than one another.\n\nWeierstrass was concerned to purge the foundations of analysis of all\ntraces of the intuition of continuous motion\u2014in a word, to\nreplace the variable by the static. For Weierstrass a variable \\(x\\)\nwas simply a symbol designating an arbitrary member of a given set of\nnumbers, and a continuous variable one whose corresponding set \\(S\\)\nhas the property that any interval around any member \\(x\\) of \\(S\\)\ncontains members of \\(S\\) other than \\(x\\). Weierstrass also\nformulated the familiar \\((\\varepsilon , \\delta)\\) definition of\ncontinuous\n function:[29]\n a function \\(f(x)\\) is continuous at \\(a\\) if for any \\(\\varepsilon\n\\gt 0\\) there is a \\(\\delta \\gt 0\\) such that \\(\\lvert f(x) -\nf(a)\\rvert \\lt \\varepsilon\\) for all \\(x\\) such that \\(\\lvert x -\na\\rvert \\lt\n \\delta\\).[30]\n\nFollowing Weierstrass\u2019s efforts, another attack on the problem\nof formulating rigorous definitions of continuity and the real numbers\nwas mounted by Richard Dedekind (1831\u20131916). Dedekind focussed\nattention on the question: exactly what is it that distinguishes a\ncontinuous domain from a discontinuous one? He seems to have been the\nfirst to recognize that the property of density, possessed by the\nordered set of rational numbers, is insufficient to guarantee\ncontinuity. In Continuity and Irrational Numbers (1872) he\nremarks that when the rational numbers are associated to points on a\nstraight line, \u201cthere are infinitely many points [on the line]\nto which no rational number corresponds\u201d (1872: section 3 [1999:\n770]) so that the rational numbers manifest \u201ca gappiness,\nincompleteness, discontinuity\u201d, in contrast with the straight\nline\u2019s \u201cabsence of gaps, completeness, continuity\u201d\n(1872: section 3 [1999: 771]). Dedekind regards this principle as\nbeing essentially indemonstrable; he ascribes to it, rather, the\nstatus of an axiom \u201cby which we attribute to the line its\ncontinuity, by which we think continuity into the line\u201d (1872\n[1999: 771\u2013772]. It is not, Dedekind stresses, necessary for\nspace to be continuous in this sense, for \u201cmany of its\nproperties would remain the same even if it were discontinuous\u201d\n(1872 [1999: 772]).\n\nThe filling-up of gaps in the rational numbers through the\n\u201ccreation of new point-individuals\u201d (1872 [1999: 772]) is\nthe key idea underlying Dedekind\u2019s construction of the domain of\nreal numbers. He first defines a cut to be a partition\n\\((A_1,\\) \\(A_2)\\) of the rational numbers such that every member of\n\\(A_1\\) is less than every member of \\(A_2\\). After noting that each\nrational number corresponds, in an evident way, to a cut, he observes\nthat infinitely many cuts fail to be engendered by rational numbers.\nThe discontinuity or incompleteness of the domain of rational numbers\nconsists precisely in this latter fact.\n\nIt is to be noted that Dedekind does not identify irrational numbers\nwith cuts; rather, each irrational number is newly\n\u201ccreated\u201d by a mental act, and remains quite distinct from\nits associated cut. Dedekind goes on to show how the domain of cuts,\nand thereby the associated domain of real numbers, can be ordered in\nsuch a way as to possess the property of continuity, viz.\n\n\n\nif the system \\(\\Re\\) of all real numbers divides into two classes\n\\(\\fA_1\\), \\(\\fA_2\\) such that every number \\(a_1\\) of the class\n\\(\\fA_1\\) is less than every number \\(a_2\\) of the class \\(\\fA_2\\),\nthen there exists one and only one number by which this separation is\nproduced. (1872: section 5 [1999: 776])\n\n\nThe most visionary \u201carithmetizer\u201d of all was Georg\n Cantor[31]\n (1845\u20131918). Cantor\u2019s analysis of the continuum in terms\nof infinite point sets led to his theory of transfinite numbers and to\nthe eventual freeing of the concept of set from its geometric origins\nas a collection of points, so paving the way for the emergence of the\nconcept of general abstract set central to today\u2019s mathematics.\nLike Weierstrass and Dedekind, Cantor aimed to formulate an adequate\ndefinition of the real numbers which avoided the presupposition of\ntheir prior existence, and he follows them in basing his definition on\nthe rational numbers. Following Cauchy, he calls a sequence \\(a_1,\\)\n\\(a_2 ,\\)\u2026, \\(a_n,\\)\u2026 of rational numbers a\nfundamental sequence if there exists an integer \\(N\\) such\nthat, for any positive rational \\(\\varepsilon\\), there exists an\ninteger \\(N\\) such that \\(\\lvert a_{n+m} - a_n \\rvert \\lt\n\\varepsilon\\) for all \\(m\\) and all \\(n \\gt N\\). Any sequence\n\\(\\langle a_n\\rangle\\) satisfying this condition is said to have a\ndefinite limit b. Dedekind had taken irrational numbers to be\nmental objects associated with cuts, so, analogously, Cantor\nregards these definite limits, as nothing more than formal\nsymbols associated with fundamental sequences (Dauben 1979:\n38). The domain \\(B\\) of such symbols may be considered an enlargement\nof the domain \\(A\\) of rational numbers. After imposing an\narithmetical structure on the domain \\(B\\), Cantor is emboldened to\nrefer to its elements as (real) numbers. Nevertheless, he\nstill insists that these \u201cnumbers\u201d have no existence\nexcept as representatives of fundamental sequences. Cantor then shows\nthat each point on the line corresponds to a definite element of\n\\(B\\). Conversely, each element of \\(B\\) should determine a definite\npoint on the line. Realizing that the intuitive nature of the linear\ncontinuum precludes a rigorous proof of this property, Cantor simply\nassumes it as an axiom, just as Dedekind had done in regard to his\nprinciple of continuity.\n\nFor Cantor, who began as a number-theorist, and throughout his career\ncleaved to the discrete, it was numbers, rather than geometric points,\nthat possessed objective significance. Indeed the isomorphism between\nthe discrete numerical domain \\(B\\) and the linear continuum was\nregarded by Cantor essentially as a device for facilitating the\nmanipulation of numbers.\n\nCantor\u2019s arithmetization of the continuum had the following\nimportant consequence. It had long been recognized that the sets of\npoints of any pair of line segments, even if one of them is infinite\nin length, can be placed in one-one correspondence. This fact was\ntaken to show that such sets of points have no well-defined\n\u201csize\u201d. But Cantor\u2019s identification of the set of\npoints on a linear continuum with a domain of numbers enabled the\nsizes of point sets to be compared in a definite way, using\nthe well-grounded idea of one-one correspondence between sets\nof numbers.\n\nCantor\u2019s investigations into the properties of subsets of the\nlinear continuum are presented in six masterly papers published during\n1879\u201384, \u00dcber unendliche lineare\nPunktmannichfaltigkeiten (\u201cOn infinite, linear point\nmanifolds\u201d). Remarkable in their richness of ideas, these papers\nprovide the first accounts of Cantor\u2019s revolutionary theory of\ninfinite sets and its application to the classification of subsets of\nthe linear continuum. In the fifth of these papers, the\nGrundlagen of 1883, are to be found some of Cantor\u2019s\nmost searching observations on the nature of the continuum.\n\nCantor begins his examination of the continuum with a tart summary of\nthe controversies that have traditionally surrounded the notion,\nremarking that the continuum has until recently been regarded as an\nessentially unanalyzable concept. It is Cantor\u2019s concern to \n\n\ndevelop the concept of the continuum as soberly and briefly as\npossible, and only with regard to the mathematical theory of\nsets. (1883 [1999: \u00a710, para. 2, p. 903]) \n\n\nThis opens the way, he believes, to the formulation of an exact\nconcept of the continuum. Cantor points out that the idea of the\ncontinuum has heretofore merely been presupposed by mathematicians\nconcerned with the analysis of continuous functions and the like, and\nhas \u201cnot been subjected to any more thorough inspection\u201d\n(1883 [1999: \u00a710, para. 3, p. 904]).\n\nRepudiating any use of spatial or temporal intuition in an exact\ndetermination of the continuum, Cantor undertakes its precise\narithmetical definition. Making reference to the definition of real\nnumber he has already provided (i.e., in terms of fundamental\nsequences), he introduces the \\(n\\)-dimensional arithmetical space\n\\(G_n\\) as the set of all \\(n\\)-tuples of real numbers \\(\\langle\nx_1,x_2 ,\\ldots ,x_n\\rangle\\), calling each such an arithmetical\npoint of \\(G_{n.}\\) The distance between two such points is given\nby \n\n\\[\n\\sqrt{(x'_1 - x_1)^2  + (x'_2 - x_2)^2 + \\ldots (x'_n - x_n)^2}\n\\]\n\n\nCantor defines an arithmetical point-set in \\(G_n\\) to be any\n\u201caggregate of points of the points of the space \\(G_n\\) that is\ngiven in a lawlike way\u201d (1883 [1999: \u00a710, para. 6, p.\n904]).\n\nAfter remarking that he has previously shown that all spaces \\(G_n\\)\nhave the same power as the set of real numbers in the interval (0,1),\nand reiterating his conviction that any infinite point sets has either\nthe power of the set of natural numbers or that of\n (0,1),[32]\n Cantor turns to the definition of the general concept of a continuum\nwithin \\(G_{n}.\\) For this he employs the concept of\nderivative or derived set of a point set introduced\nin a paper of 1872 on trigonometric series. Cantor had defined the derived\nset of a point set \\(P\\) to be the set of limit points of\n\\(P,\\) where a limit point of \\(P\\) is a point of \\(P\\) with\ninfinitely many points of \\(P\\) arbitrarily close to it. A point set\nis called perfect if it coincides with its derived\n set.[33]\n Cantor observes that this condition does not suffice to characterize\na continuum, since perfect sets can be constructed in the linear\ncontinuum which are dense in no interval, however small: as an example\nof such a set he offers the\n set[34]\n consisting of all real numbers in (0,1) whose ternary expansion does\nnot contain a \u201c1\u201d.\n\nAccordingly an additional condition is needed to define a continuum.\nCantor supplies this by introducing the concept of a\nconnected set. A point set \\(T\\) is connected in\nCantor\u2019s sense if for any pair of its points \\(t, t'\\) and any\narbitrarily small number \\(\\varepsilon\\) there is a finite sequence of\npoints \\(t_1,\\) \\(t_2,\\)\u2026, \\(t_n\\) of \\(T\\) for which the\ndistances \\([tt_1],\\) \\([t_1 t_2],\\) \\([t_2 t_3],\\) \u2026, \\([t_n\nt'],\\) are all less than \\(\\varepsilon\\). Cantor now defines a\ncontinuum to be a perfect connected point set.\n\nCantor has advanced beyond his predecessors in formulating what is in\nessence a topological definition of continuum, one that,\nwhile still dependent on metric notions, does not involve an order\n relation.[35]\nIt is interesting to compare Cantor\u2019s definition with the\ndefinition of continuum in modern general topology. In a well-known\ntextbook (Hocking & Young 1961: 43) on the subject we find\na continuum defined as a compact connected subset of a\ntopological space. Now within any bounded region of Euclidean\nspace it can be shown that Cantor\u2019s continua coincide with\ncontinua in the sense of the modern definition. While Cantor lacked\nthe definition of compactness, his requirement that continua be\n\u201ccomplete\u201d (which led to his rejecting as continua such\nnoncompact sets as open intervals or discs) is not far away from the\nidea.\n\nThroughout Cantor\u2019s mathematical career he maintained an\nunwavering, even dogmatic opposition to infinitesimals, attacking the\nefforts of mathematicians such as du Bois-Reymond and\nVeronese[36]\nto formulate rigorous theories of actual infinitesimals. As far as\nCantor was concerned, the infinitesimal was beyond the realm of the\npossible; infinitesimals were no more than \u201ccastles in the air,\nor rather just nonsense\u201d (1893 [1965: 506], translated by Fisher\n1981: 118), to be classed \u201cwith circular squares and square\ncircles\u201d (1893 [1965: 507], translated by Fisher 1981: 118). His\nabhorrence of infinitesimals went so deep as to move him to outright\nvilification, branding them as \u201cCholera-bacilli of\nmathematics\u201d (1893 [1965: 505], translated by Fisher 1981:\n116). Cantor\u2019s rejection of infinitesimals stemmed from his\nconviction that his own theory of transfinite ordinal and cardinal\nnumbers exhausted the realm of the numerable, so that no further\ngeneralization of the concept of number, in particular any which\nembraced infinitesimals, was admissible.\n6. Critical Reactions to Arithmetization\n\nDespite the great success of Weierstrass, Dedekind and Cantor in\nconstructing the continuum from arithmetical materials, a number of\nthinkers of the late nineteenth and early twentieth centuries remained\nopposed, in varying degrees, to the idea of explicating the continuum\nconcept entirely in discrete terms. These include the philosophers\nBrentano and Peirce and the mathematicians Poincar\u00e9, Brouwer\nand Weyl.\n\nIn his later years the Austrian philosopher Franz Brentano\n(1838\u20131917) became preoccupied with the nature of the continuous\n(Brentano [PISTC]). In its fundamentals Brentano\u2019s account\nof the continuous is akin to Aristotle\u2019s. Brentano regards\ncontinuity as something given in perception, primordial in nature,\nrather than a mathematical construction. He held that the idea of the\ncontinuous is abstracted from sensible intuition. Brentano suggests\nthat the continuous is brought to appearance by sensible intuition in\nthree phases. First, sensation presents us with objects having parts\nthat coincide. From such objects the concept of boundary is\nabstracted in turn, and then one grasps that these objects actually\ncontain coincident boundaries. Finally one sees that this is\nall that is required in order to have grasped the concept of a\ncontinuum.\n\nFor Brentano the essential feature of a continuum is its inherent\ncapacity to engender boundaries, and the fact that such boundaries can\nbe grasped as coincident. Boundaries themselves possess a quality\nwhich Brentano calls plerosis (\u201cfullness\u201d).\nPlerosis is the measure of the number of directions in which the given\nboundary actually bounds. Thus, for example, within a temporal\ncontinuum the endpoint of a past episode or the starting point of a\nfuture one bounds in a single direction, while the point marking the\nend of one episode and the beginning of another may be said to bound\ndoubly. In the case of a spatial continuum there are numerous\nadditional possibilities: here a boundary may bound in all the\ndirections of which it is capable of bounding, or it may bound in only\nsome of these directions. In the former case, the boundary is said to\nexist in full plerosis; in the latter, in partial\nplerosis. Brentano believed that the concept of plerosis enabled\nsense to be made of the idea that a boundary possesses\n\u201cparts\u201d, even when the boundary lacks dimensions\naltogether, as in the case of a point. Thus, while the present or\n\u201cnow\u201d is, according to Brentano, temporally unextended and\nexists only as a boundary between past and future, it still possesses\ntwo \u201cparts\u201d or aspects: it is both the end of the past and\nthe beginning of the future. It is worth mentioning that for Brentano\nit was not just the \u201cnow\u201d that existed only as a boundary;\nsince, like Aristotle he held that \u201cexistence\u201d in the\nstrict sense means \u201cexistence now\u201d, it\nnecessarily followed that existing things exist only as boundaries of\nwhat has existed or of what will exist, or both.\n\nBrentano took a somewhat dim view of the efforts of mathematicians to\nconstruct the continuum from numbers. His attitude varied from\nrejecting such attempts as inadequate to according them the status of\n \u201cfictions\u201d.[37]\n This is not surprising given his Aristotelian inclination to take\nmathematical and physical theories to be genuine descriptions of\nempirical phenomena rather than idealizations: in his view, if such\ntheories were to be taken as literal descriptions of experience, they\nwould amount to nothing better than\n\u201cmisrepresentations\u201d.\n\nBrentano\u2019s analysis of the continuum centered on its\nphenomenological and qualitative aspects, which are by their very\nnature incapable of reduction to the discrete. Brentano\u2019s\nrejection of the mathematicians\u2019 attempts to construct it in\ndiscrete terms is thus hardly surprising.\n\nThe American philosopher-mathematician Charles Sanders Peirce\u2019s\n(1839\u20131914) view of the\n continuum[38]\n was, in a sense, intermediate between that of Brentano and the\narithmetizers. Like Brentano, he held that the cohesiveness of a\ncontinuum rules out the possibility of it being a mere collection of\ndiscrete individuals, or points, in the usual sense. And even before\nBrouwer, Peirce seems to have been aware that a faithful account of\nthe continuum will involve questioning the law of excluded middle.\nPeirce also held that any continuum harbors an unboundedly\nlarge collection of points\u2014in his colorful terminology, a\nsupermultitudinous collection\u2014what we would today call\na proper class. Peirce maintained that if\nenough points were to be crowded together by carrying insertion of new\npoints between old to its ultimate limit they would\u2014through\na logical \u201ctransformation of quantity into\nquality\u201d\u2014lose their individual identity and become fused\ninto a true continuum.\n\nPeirce\u2019s conception of the number continuum is also notable for\nthe presence in it of an abundance of infinitesimals, Peirce\nchampioned the retention of the infinitesimal concept in the\nfoundations of the calculus, both because of what he saw as the\nefficiency of infinitesimal methods, and because he regarded\ninfinitesimals as constituting the \u201cglue\u201d causing points\non a continuous line to lose their individual identity.\n\nThe idea of continuity played a central role in the thought of the\ngreat French mathematician Henri\n Poincar\u00e9[39]\n (1854\u20131912). While accepting the arithmetic definition of the\ncontinuum, he questions the fact that (as with Dedekind and\nCantor\u2019s formulations) the (irrational) numbers so produced are\nmere symbols, detached from their origins in intuition. Unlike Cantor,\nPoincar\u00e9 accepted the infinitesimal, even if he did not regard\nall of the concept\u2019s manifestations as useful.\n\nThe Dutch mathematician L. E. J. Brouwer (1881\u20131966) is best\nknown as the founder of the philosophy of (neo)intuitionism\n(Brouwer [1975]; van Dalen 1998). Brouwer\u2019s highly idealist\nviews on mathematics bore some resemblance to Kant\u2019s. For\nBrouwer, mathematical concepts are admissible only if they are\nadequately grounded in intuition, mathematical theories are\nsignificant only if they concern entities which are constructed out of\nsomething given immediately in intuition, and mathematical\ndemonstration is a form of construction in intuition. While admitting\nthat the emergence of noneuclidean geometry had discredited\nKant\u2019s view of space, Brouwer held, in opposition to the\nlogicists (whom he called \u201cformalists\u201d) that arithmetic,\nand so all mathematics, must derive from temporal intuition.\n\nInitially Brouwer held without qualification that the continuum is not\nconstructible from discrete points, but was later to modify this\ndoctrine. In his mature thought, he radically transformed the concept\nof point, endowing points with sufficient fluidity to enable them to\nserve as generators of a \u201ctrue\u201d continuum. This fluidity\nwas achieved by admitting as \u201cpoints\u201d, not only fully\ndefined discrete numbers such as \\(\\sqrt{2},\\) \\(\\pi,\\) \\(e,\\) and the\nlike\u2014which have, so to speak, already achieved\n\u201cbeing\u201d\u2014but also \u201cnumbers\u201d which are in\na perpetual state of becoming in that there the entries in their\ndecimal (or dyadic) expansions are the result of free acts of choice\nby a subject operating throughout an indefinitely extended time. The\nresulting choice sequences cannot be conceived as finished,\ncompleted objects: at any moment only an initial segment is known. In\nthis way Brouwer obtained the mathematical continuum in a way\ncompatible with his belief in the primordial intuition of\ntime\u2014that is, as an unfinished, indeed unfinishable entity in a\nperpetual state of growth, a \u201cmedium of free development\u201d.\nIn this conception, the mathematical continuum is indeed\n\u201cconstructed\u201d, not, however, by initially shattering, as\ndid Cantor and Dedekind, an intuitive continuum into isolated points,\nbut rather by assembling it from a complex of continually changing\noverlapping parts.\n\nThe mathematical continuum as conceived by Brouwer displays a number\nof features that seem bizarre to the classical eye. For example, in\nthe Brouwerian continuum the usual law of comparability, namely that\nfor any real numbers \\(a, b\\) either \\(a \\lt b\\) or \\(a = b\\) or \\(a\n\\gt b\\), fails. Even more fundamental is the failure of the law of\nexcluded middle in the form that for any real numbers \\(a, b\\), either\n\\(a = b\\) or \\(a \\ne b\\). The failure of these seemingly\nunquestionable principles in turn vitiates the proofs of a number of\nbasic results of classical analysis, for example the\nBolzano-Weierstrass theorem, as well as the theorems of monotone\nconvergence, intermediate value, least upper bound, and maximum value\nfor continuous\n functions.[40]\n\nWhile the Brouwerian continuum may possess a number of negative\nfeatures from the standpoint of the classical mathematician, it has\nthe merit of corresponding more closely to the continuum of intuition\nthan does its classical counterpart. Far from being bizarre, the\nfailure of the law of excluded middle for points in the intuitionistic\ncontinuum may be seen as fitting in well with the character of the\nintuitive continuum.\n\nIn 1924, Brouwer showed that every function defined on a closed\ninterval of his continuum is uniformly continuous.  As a consequence\nthe intuitionistic continuum is indecomposable, that is,\ncannot be split into two disjoint parts in any way whatsoever. In\ncontrast with a discrete entity, the indecomposable Brouwerian\ncontinuum cannot be composed of its parts.  Brouwer\u2019s vision of\nthe continuum has in recent years become the subject of intensive\nmathematical investigation.\n\nHermann Weyl (1885\u20131955), one of most versatile mathematicians\nof the twentieth century, was preoccupied with the nature of the\ncontinuum (Bell 2000). In his Das Kontinuum of 1918 he\nattempts to provide the continuum with an exact mathematical\nformulation free of the set-theoretic assumptions he had come to\nregard as objectionable. As he saw it, there is an unbridgeable gap\nbetween intuitively given continua (e.g., those of space, time and\nmotion) on the one hand, and the discrete exact concepts of\nmathematics (e.g., that of real number) on the other. For Weyl the\npresence of this split meant that the construction of the mathematical\ncontinuum could not simply be \u201cread off\u201d from intuition.\nRather, he believed that the mathematical continuum must be treated\nand, in the end, justified in the same way as a physical theory.\nHowever much he may have wished it, in Das Kontinuum Weyl did\nnot aim to provide a mathematical formulation of the continuum as it\nis presented to intuition, which, as the quotations above show, he\nregarded as an impossibility (at that time at least). Rather, his goal\nwas first to achieve consistency by putting the\narithmetical notion of real number on a firm logical basis,\nand then to show that the resulting theory is reasonable by\nemploying it as the foundation for a plausible account of continuous\nprocess in the objective physical world.\n\nLater Weyl came to repudiate atomistic theories of the continuum,\nincluding that of his own Das Kontinuum. He accordingly\nwelcomed Brouwer\u2019s construction of the continuum by means of\nsequences generated by free acts of choice, thus identifying it as a\n\u201cmedium of free Becoming\u201d which \u201cdoes not dissolve\ninto a set of real numbers as finished entities\u201d (Weyl 1921,\n50). Weyl felt that Brouwer, through his doctrine of intuitionism, had\ncome closer than anyone else to bridging that \u201cunbridgeable\nchasm\u201d between the intuitive and mathematical continua. In\nparticular, he found compelling the fact that the Brouwerian continuum\nis not the union of two disjoint nonempty parts\u2014that it is\nindecomposable. \u201cA genuine continuum\u201d, Weyl says,\n\u201ccannot be divided into separate fragments\u201d. In later\npublications he expresses this more colorfully by quoting Anaxagoras\nto the effect that a continuum \u201cdefies the chopping off of its\nparts with a hatchet\u201d.\n7. Nonstandard Analysis\n\nOnce the continuum had been provided with a set-theoretic foundation,\nthe use of the infinitesimal in mathematical analysis was largely\nabandoned. And so the situation remained for a number of years. The\nfirst signs of a revival of the infinitesimal approach to analysis\nsurfaced in 1958 with a paper by C. Schmieden and D. Laugwitz. But the\nmajor breakthrough came in 1960 when it occurred to the mathematical\nlogician Abraham Robinson (1918\u20131974) that \n\n\nthe concepts and methods of contemporary Mathematical Logic are\ncapable of providing a suitable framework for the development of the\nDifferential and Integral Calculus by means of infinitely small and\ninfinitely large numbers. (preface of Robinson 1966: vii [1996: xiii])\n\n\n\nThis insight led to the creation of nonstandard\n analysis,[41]\n which Robinson regarded as realizing Leibniz\u2019s conception of\ninfinitesimals and infinities as ideal numbers possessing the same\nproperties as ordinary real numbers.\n\nAfter Robinson\u2019s initial insight, a number of ways of presenting\nnonstandard analysis were developed. Here is a sketch of one of\nthem.\n\nStarting with the classical real line \\(\\Re\\), a set-theoretic\nuniverse\u2014the standard universe\u2014is first\nconstructed over it: here by such a universe is meant a set \\(U\\)\ncontaining \\(\\Re\\) which is closed under the usual set-theoretic\noperations of union, power set, Cartesian products and subsets. Now\nwrite \\(\\fU\\) for the structure \\((U, \\in)\\), where \\(\\in\\) is the\nusual membership relation on \\(U\\): associated with this is the\nextension \\(\\cL(U)\\) of the first-order language of set theory to\ninclude a name \\(\\boldsymbol{u}\\) for each element \\(u\\) of \\(U\\).\nNow, using the well-known compactness theorem for first-order logic,\n\\(\\fU\\) is extended to a new structure \\(^*\\fU = (^*U\\), \\(^*{\\in})\\),\ncalled a nonstandard universe, satisfying the following key\nprinciple:\n\n\nSaturation Principle. Let \\(\\Phi\\) be a collection of\n\\(\\cL(U)\\)-formulas with exactly one free variable. If \\(\\Phi\\) is\nfinitely satisfiable in \\(\\fU\\), that is, if for any finite\nsubset \\(\\Phi '\\) of \\(\\Phi\\) there is an element of \\(U\\) which\nsatisfies all the formulas of \\(\\Phi '\\) in \\(\\fU\\), then there is an\nelement of \\(^*U\\) which satisfies all the formulas of \\(\\Phi\\) in\n\\(^*\\fU\\).\n\n\nThe saturation property expresses the intuitive idea that the\nnonstandard universe is very rich in comparison to the standard one.\nIndeed, while there may exist, for each finite subcollection \\(\\cF\\)\nof a given collection of properties \\(\\cP\\), an element of \\(U\\)\nsatisfying the members of \\(\\cF\\) in \\(\\fU\\), there may not\nnecessarily be an element of \\(U\\) satisfying all the members\nof \\(\\cP\\). The saturation of \\(^*\\fU\\) guarantees the existence of an\nelement of \\(^*U\\) which satisfies, in \\(^*\\fU\\), all the members of\n\\(\\cP\\). For example, suppose the set \\(\\bbN\\) of natural numbers is a\nmember of \\(U\\); for each \\(n \\in \\bbN\\) let \\(P_n (x)\\) be the\nproperty \\(x \\in \\bbN \\amp n \\lt x\\). Then clearly, while each finite\nsubcollection of the collection \\(\\cP = \\{P_n : n \\in \\bbN\\}\\) is\nsatisfiable in \\(\\fU\\), the whole collection is not. An element of\n\\(^*U\\) satisfying \\(\\cP\\) in \\(^*\\fU\\) will then be an \u201cnatural\nnumber\u201d greater than every member of \\(\\bbN\\), that is, an\ninfinite number.\n\nFrom the saturation property it follows that \\(^*\\fU\\) satisfies the\nimportant\n\n\nTransfer Principle. If \\(\\sigma\\) is any sentence of\n\\(\\cL(U)\\), then \\(\\sigma\\) holds in \\(\\fU\\) if and only if it holds\nin \\(^*\\fU\\).\n\n\nThe transfer principle may be seen as a version of Leibniz\u2019s\ncontinuity principle: it asserts that all first-order properties are\npreserved in the passage to or \u201ctransfer\u201d from the\nstandard to the nonstandard universe.\n\nThe members of \\(U\\) are called standard sets, or\nstandard objects; those in \\(^*U - U\\) nonstandard\nsets or nonstandard objects: \\(^*U\\) thus consists of\nboth standard and nonstandard objects. The members of \\(^*U\\) will also\nbe referred to as *-sets or *-objects Since \\(U\n\\subseteq ^*U\\), under this convention every set (object) is also a\n*-set (object) The \\(^*\\)-members of a *-set \\(A\\) are the\n*-objects \\(x\\) for which \\(x \\mathbin{^*{\\in}} A\\).\n\nIf \\(A\\) is a standard set, we may consider the collection\n\\(\\hat{A}\\)\u2014the inflate of \\(A\\)\u2014consisting of\nall the *-members of \\(A\\): this is not necessarily a set nor even a\n*-set. The inflate \\(\\hat{A}\\) of a standard set \\(A\\) may be regarded\nas the same set \\(A\\) viewed from a nonstandard vantage point. While\nclearly \\(A \\subseteq \\hat{A}\\), \\(\\hat{A}\\) may contain\n\u201cnonstandard\u201d elements not in \\(A\\). It can in fact be\nshown that infinite standard sets always get\n\u201cinflated\u201d in this way. Using the transfer principle, any\nfunction \\(f\\) between standard sets automatically extends to a\nfunction\u2014also written \\(f\\)\u2014between their inflates.\n\nIf \\(\\fA = (A, R)\\) is a mathematical structure, we may\nconsider the structure \\(\\hat{\\fA} = (\\hat{A},\\hat{R})\\).  From the\ntransfer principle it follows that \\(\\fA\\) and \\(\\hat{\\fA}\\) have\nprecisely the same first-order properties.\n\nNow suppose that the set \\(\\bbN\\) of natural numbers is a member of\n\\(U\\). Then so is the set \\(\\Re\\) of real numbers, since each real\nnumber may be identified with a set of natural numbers. \\(\\Re\\) may be\nregarded as an ordered field, and the same is therefore true of its\ninflate \\(\\hat{\\Re}\\), since the latter has precisely the same\nfirst-order properties as \\(\\Re\\). \\(\\hat{\\Re}\\) is called the\nhyperreal line, and its members hyperreals. A\nstandard hyperreal is then just a real, to which we shall refer for\nemphasis as a standard real. Since \\(\\Re\\) is infinite,\nnonstandard hyperreals must exist. The saturation principle implies\nthat there must be an infinite (nonstandard)\n hyperreal,[42]\n that is, a hyperreal \\(a\\) such that \\(a \\gt n\\) for every \\(n \\in\n\\bbN\\). In that case its reciprocal 1/\\(a\\) is infinitesimal in the\nsense of exceeding 0 and yet being smaller than 1/\\(n+1\\) for every\n\\(n \\in \\bbN\\). In general, we call a hyperreal a\ninfinitesimal if its absolute value \\(\\lvert a\\rvert\\) is less\nthan 1/\\(n+1\\) for every \\(n \\in \\bbN\\). In that case the set \\(I\\) of\ninfinitesimals contains not just 0 but a substantial number (in fact,\ninfinitely many) other elements. Clearly \\(I\\) is an additive subgroup\nof \\(\\Re\\), that is, if \\(a, b \\in I\\), then \\(a - b \\in I\\).\n\nThe members of the inflate \\(\\hat{\\bbN}\\) of \\(\\bbN\\) are called\nhypernatural numbers. As for the hyperreals, it can be shown\nthat \\(\\hat{\\bbN}\\) also contains nonstandard elements which must\nexceed every member of \\(\\bbN\\); these are called infinite\nhypernatural numbers.\n\nFor hyperreals \\(a, b\\) we define \\(a \\approx b\\) and say that \\(a\\)\nand \\(b\\) are infinitesimally close if \\(a - b \\in I\\). This\nis an equivalence relation on the hyperreal line: for each hyperreal\n\\(a\\) we write \\(\\mu(a)\\) for the equivalence class of \\(a\\) under\nthis relation and call it the monad of \\(a\\). The monad of a\nhyperreal \\(a\\) thus consists of all the hyperreals that are\ninfinitesimally close to \\(a\\): it may be thought of as a small cloud\ncentered at \\(a\\). Note also that \\(\\mu\\)(0) \\(= I\\).\n\nA hyperreal \\(a\\) is finite if it is not infinite; this means\nthat \\(\\lvert a\\rvert \\lt n\\) for some \\(n \\in \\bbN\\) . It is not\ndifficult to show that finiteness is equivalent to the condition of\nnear-standardness; here a hyperreal \\(a\\) is\nnear-standard if \\(a \\approx r\\) for some standard real\n\\(r\\).\n\nMuch of the usefulness of nonstandard analysis stems from the fact\nthat statements of classical analysis involving limits or the\n\\((\\varepsilon , \\delta)\\) criterion admit succinct, intuitive\ntranslations into statements involving infinitesimals or infinite\nnumbers, in turn enabling comparatively straightforward proofs to be\ngiven of classical theorems. Here are some examples of such\n translations:[43]\n\nLet \\(\\langle s_n\\rangle\\) be a standard infinite sequence of real\nnumbers and let \\(s\\) be a standard real number. Then \\(s\\) is the\nlimit of \\(\\langle s_n\\rangle\\) within \\(\\Re\\), \\(\\lim_{n\\rightarrow\n\\infty} s_n = s\\) in the classical sense, if and only if \\(s_n \\approx\ns\\) for all infinite subscripts \\(n\\).\nA standard sequence \\(\\langle s_n\\rangle\\) converges if and only\nif \\(s_n \\approx s_m\\) for all infinite \\(n\\) and \\(m\\).\n(Cauchy\u2019s criterion for convergence.)\n\n\nNow suppose that \\(f\\) is a real-valued function defined on some open\ninterval \\((a, b)\\). We have remarked above that \\(f\\) automatically\nextends to a function\u2014also written \\(f\\)\u2014on\n\\(\\widehat{(a,b)}\\). \n\nIn order that the standard real number \\(c\\) be the limit of\n\\(f(x)\\) as \\(x\\) approaches \\(x_0\\), \\(\\lim_{x\\rightarrow x_0}f(x) =\nc\\), with \\(x_0\\) a standard real number in \\((a, b)\\), it is\nnecessary and sufficient that \\(f(x) \\approx f(x_0)\\) for all \\(x\n\\approx x_0\\).\nThe function \\(f\\) is continuous at a standard real number \\(x_0\\)\nin \\((a, b)\\) if and only if \\(f(x) \\approx f(x_0)\\) for all \\(x\n\\approx x_0\\). (This is equivalent to saying that \\(f\\) maps the monad\nof \\(x_0\\) into the monad of \\(f(x_0\\).)\nIn order that the standard number \\(c\\) be the derivative of \\(f\\)\nat \\(x_0\\) it is necessary and sufficient that \n\n\\[ \\frac{f(x) - f(x_0)}{x - x_0} \\approx c \\]\n\n for all \\(x\n\\ne x_0\\) in the monad of \\(x_0\\).\n\n\nMany other branches of mathematics admit neat and fruitful nonstandard\nformulations.\n8. The Constructive Real Line and the Intuitionistic Continuum\n\nThe original motivation for the development of constructive\nmathematics was to put the idea of mathematical existence on a\nconstructive or computable basis. While there are a number of\nvarieties of constructive mathematics (Bridges & Richman 1987),\nhere we shall focus on Bishop\u2019s constructive analysis (Bishop\n& Bridges 1985; Bridges 1994, 1999; and Bridges & Richman\n1987) and Brouwer\u2019s intuitionistic analysis (Dummett 1977).\n\nIn constructive mathematics a problem is counted as solved only if an\nexplicit solution can, in principle at least, be produced. Thus, for\nexample, \u201cThere is an \\(x\\) such that \\(P(x)\\)\u201d means\nthat, in principle at least, we can explicitly produce an \\(x\\) such\nthat \\(P(x)\\). This fact led to the questioning of certain principles\nof classical logic, in particular, the law of excluded middle, and the\ncreation of a new logic, intuitionistic logic (see entry on\n intuitionistic logic).\n It also led to the introduction of a sharpened definition of real\nnumbers\u2014the constructive real numbers. A constructive real\nnumber is a sequence of rationals \\((r_n) = r_1, r_2,\\ldots\\) such\nthat, for any \\(k\\), a number \\(n\\) can be computed in such a way that\n\\(\\lvert r_{n+p} - r_{n}\\rvert \\le 1/k\\). Each rational number a may\nbe regarded as a real number by identifying it with the real number\n\\((\\alpha , \\alpha ,\\ldots)\\). The set \\(R\\) of all constructive real\nnumbers is the constructive real line.\n\nNow of course, for any \u201cgiven\u201d real number there are a\nvariety of ways of giving explicit approximating sequences for it.\nThus it is necessary to define an equivalence relation,\n\u201cequality on the reals\u201d. The correct definition here is:\n\\(r =_{\\Re} s\\) iff for any \\(k\\), a number \\(n\\) can be found so that\n\\(\\lvert r_{n+p} - s_{n+p}\\rvert \\le 1/k\\), for all \\(p\\). To say that\ntwo real numbers are equal is to say that they are equivalent in this\nsense.\n\nThe real number line can be furnished with an axiomatic description.\nWe begin by assuming the existence of a set \\(R\\) with\n\na binary relation \\(\\gt\\) (greater than)\na corresponding apartness relation \\(\\apart\\) defined by\n\\(x \\apart y \\Leftrightarrow x \\gt y\\) or \\(y \\gt x\\)\na unary operation \\(x \\mapsto -x\\)\nbinary operations \\((x, y) \\mapsto (x + y\\) (addition)\nand \\((x, y) \\mapsto xy\\) (multiplication)\ndistinguished elements 0 (zero) and 1 (one) with\n\\(0 \\ne 1\\)\na unary operation \\(x \\mapsto x^{-1}\\) on the set of elements\n\\(\\ne 0\\).\n\n\nThe elements of \\(R\\) are called real numbers. A real number\n\\(x\\) is positive if \\(x \\gt 0\\) and negative if\n\\(-x \\gt 0\\). The relation \\(\\ge\\) (greater than or equal to)\nis defined by \n\n\\[x \\ge y \\Longleftrightarrow \\forall z(y \\gt z \\Rightarrow x \\gt z).\\]\n\n\nThe relations \\(\\lt\\) and \\(\\le\\) are defined in the usual way; \\(x\\)\nis nonnegative if \\(0 \\le x\\). Two real numbers are\nequal if \\(x \\ge y\\) and \\(y \\ge x\\), in which case we write\n\\(x = y\\).\n\nThe sets \\(N\\) of natural numbers, \\(N^+\\) of positive integers, \\(Z\\)\nof integers and \\(Q\\) of rational numbers are identified with the\nusual subsets of \\(R\\); for instance \\(N^+\\) is identified with the\nset of elements of \\(R\\) of the form \\(1 + 1 + \\ldots + 1\\).\n\nThese relations and operations are subject to the following three\ngroups of axioms, which, taken together, form the system\nCA of axioms for constructive analysis, or\nthe constructive real numbers (Bridges 1999).\n\nField Axioms\n\n\\(x + y = y + x\\)\n\\((x + y) + z = x + (y + z)\\)\n\\(0 + x = x\\)\n\\(x + (-x) = 0 xy = yx\\)\n\\((xy)z = x(yz)\\)\n\\(1 x = x\\)\n\\(xx^{-1} = 1\\) if \\(x \\apart 0\\)\n\\(x(y + z) = xy + xz\\)\n\n\nOrder Axioms\n\n\\(\\neg(x \\gt y \\wland y \\gt x)\\)\n\\(x \\gt y \\Longrightarrow \\forall z(x \\gt z \\wlor z \\gt y)\\)\n\\(\\neg(x \\apart y) \\Longrightarrow x = y\\)\n\\(x \\gt y \\Longrightarrow \\forall z(x + z \\gt y + z)\\)\n\\((x \\gt 0 \\wland y \\gt 0) \\Longrightarrow xy \\gt 0\\).\n\n\nThe last two axioms introduce special properties of \\(\\gt\\) and\n\\(\\ge\\). In the second of these the notions bounded above, bounded\nbelow, and bounded are defined as in classical mathematics, and\nthe least upper bound, if it exists, of a\n nonempty[44]\n set \\(S\\) of real numbers is the unique real number \\(b\\) such\nthat\n\n\\(b\\) is an upper bound for \\(S\\), and\nfor each \\(c \\lt b\\) there exists \\(s \\in S\\) with \\(s \\gt\nc\\).\n\n\nSpecial Properties of \\(\\gt\\).\n\n\n Archimedean axiom. For each \\(x \\in R\\) such that \\(x\n\\ge 0\\) there exists \\(n \\in N\\) such that \\(x \\lt n\\).\n The least upper bound principle. Let \\(S\\) be a nonempty\nsubset of \\(R\\) that is bounded above relative to the relation\n\\(\\ge\\), such that for all real numbers \\(a, b\\) with \\(a \\lt b\\),\neither \\(b\\) is an upper bound for \\(S\\) or else there exists \\(s \\in\nS\\) with \\(s \\gt a\\). Then \\(S\\) has a least upper bound.\n\n\n\nThe following basic properties of \\(\\gt\\) and \\(\\ge\\) can then be\nestablished.\n\n\\(\\neg(x \\gt x)\\) \n\\(x \\ge x\\)\n\\(x \\gt y \\wland y \\gt z \\Longrightarrow x \\gt z\\)\n\\(\\neg(x \\gt y \\wland y \\ge x)\\) \n\\((x \\gt y \\ge z) \\Longrightarrow x \\gt z\\)\n\\(\\neg(x \\gt y) \\Longleftrightarrow y \\ge x\\) \n\\(\\neg \\neg(x \\ge y) \\Longleftrightarrow \\neg \\neg(y \\gt x)\\)\n\\((x \\ge y \\ge z) \\Longrightarrow x \\ge z\\) \n\\((x \\ge y \\wland y \\ge x) \\Longrightarrow x = y\\)\n\\(\\neg(x \\gt y \\wland x = y)\\)\n\\(x \\ge 0 \\Longleftrightarrow \\forall \\varepsilon \\gt 0(x \\lt\n\\varepsilon)\\)\n\\(x + y \\gt 0 \\Longrightarrow (x \\gt 0 \\wlor y \\gt 0)\\)\n\\(x \\gt 0 \\Longrightarrow -x \\lt 0\\)\n\\((x \\gt y \\wland z \\lt 0) \\Longrightarrow yz \\gt xz\\)\n\\(x \\apart 0 \\Longrightarrow x^2 \\gt 0\\)\n\\(1 \\gt 0\\)\n\\(x^2 \\gt 0\\)\n\\(0 \\lt x \\lt 1 \\Longrightarrow x \\gt x^2\\)\n\\(x^2 \\gt 0 \\Longrightarrow x \\apart 0\\)\n\\(n \\in N^{+} \\Longrightarrow n^{-1} \\gt 0\\)\nif \\(x \\gt 0\\) and \\(y \\ge 0\\), then \\(\\exists n\\in Z(nx \\gt\ny)\\)\n\\(x \\gt 0 \\Longrightarrow x^{-1} \\gt 0\\)\n\\(xy \\gt 0 \\Longrightarrow(x \\ne 0 \\wlor y \\ne 0)\\)\nif \\(a \\lt b\\), then \\(\\exists r\\in Q(a \\lt r \\lt b)\\)\n\n\nThe constructive real line \\(R\\) as introduced above is a model of\nCA. Are there any other models, that is, models not\nisomorphic to \\(R\\). If classical logic is assumed,\nCA is a categorical theory and so the answer is no.\nBut this is not the case within intuitionistic logic, for there it is\npossible for the Dedekind and Cantor reals to fail to be isomorphic,\ndespite the fact that they are both models of CA.\n\nIn constructive analysis, a real number is an infinite (convergent)\nsequence of rational numbers generated by an effective rule, so that\nthe constructive real line is essentially just a restriction of its\nclassical counterpart. Brouwerian intuitionism takes a more liberal\nview of the matter, resulting in a considerable enrichment of the\narithmetical continuum over the version offered by strict\nconstructivism. As conceived by intuitionism, the arithmetical\ncontinuum admits as real numbers not only infinite sequences\ndetermined in advance by an effective rule for computing their terms,\nbut also ones in whose generation free selection plays a part. The\nlatter are called (free) choice sequences. Without loss of\ngenerality we may and shall assume that the entries in choice\nsequences are natural numbers.\n\nWhile constructive analysis does not formally contradict classical\nanalysis, and may in fact be regarded as a subtheory of the latter, a\nnumber of intuitionistically plausible principles have been proposed\nfor the theory of choice sequences which render intuitionistic\nanalysis divergent from its classical counterpart. One such principle\nis Brouwer\u2019s Continuity Principle: given a relation\n\\(Q(\\alpha , n)\\) between choice sequences \\(\\alpha\\) and numbers\n\\(n\\), if for each \\(\\alpha\\) a number \\(n\\) may be determined for\nwhich \\(Q(\\alpha , n)\\) holds, then \\(n\\) can already be determined on\nthe basis of the knowledge of a finite number of terms of\n \\(\\alpha\\).[45]\n From this one can prove a weak version of the Continuity Theorem,\nnamely, that every function from \\(R\\) to \\(R\\) is continuous. Another\nsuch principle is Bar Induction, a certain form of induction\nfor well-founded sets of finite\n sequences.[46]\n Brouwer used Bar Induction and the Continuity Principle in proving\nhis Continuity Theorem that every real-valued function defined on a\nclosed interval is uniformly continuous, from which, as has already\nbeen observed, it follows that the intuitionistic continuum is\nindecomposable.\n\nBrouwer gave the intuitionistic conception of mathematics an\nexplicitly subjective twist by introducing the creative\nsubject. The creative subject was conceived as a kind of\nidealized mathematician for whom time is divided into discrete\nsequential stages, during each of which he may test various\npropositions, attempt to construct proofs, and so on. In particular,\nit can always be determined whether or not at stage \\(n\\) the creative\nsubject has a proof of a particular mathematical proposition \\(p\\).\nWhile the theory of the creative subject remains controversial, its\npurely mathematical consequences can be obtained by a simple postulate\nwhich is entirely free of subjective and temporal elements.\n\nThe creative subject allows us to define, for a given proposition\n\\(p\\), a binary sequence \\(\\langle a_n\\rangle\\) by \\(a_n = 1\\) if the\ncreative subject has a proof of \\(p\\) at stage \\(n\\); \\(a_n = 0\\)\notherwise. Now if the construction of these sequences is the only use\nmade of the creative subject, then references to the latter may be\navoided by postulating the principle known as Kripke\u2019s\nScheme\n\n\nFor each proposition \\(p\\) there exists an increasing binary sequence\n\\(\\langle a_n\\rangle\\) such that \\(p\\) holds if and only if \\(a_n =\n1\\) for some \\(n\\).\n\n\nTaken together, these principles have been shown to have remarkable\nconsequences for the indecomposability of subsets of the continuum.\nNot only is the intuitionistic continuum indecomposable (that is,\ncannot be partitioned into two nonempty disjoint parts), but, assuming\nthe Continuity Principle and Kripke\u2019s Scheme, it remains\nindecomposable even if one pricks it with a pin. The intuitionistic\ncontinuum has, as it were, a syrupy nature, so that one cannot simply\ntake away one point. If in addition Bar Induction is assumed, then,\nstill more surprisingly, indecomposability is maintained even when all\nthe rational points are removed from the continuum.\n\nFinally, it has been shown that a natural notion of infinitesimal can\nbe developed within intuitionistic mathematics (Vesley 1981), the idea\nbeing that an infinitesimal should be a \u201cvery small\u201d real\nnumber in the sense of not being known to be\ndistinguishable\u2014that is, strictly greater than or less\nthan\u2014zero.\n9. Smooth Infinitesimal Analysis\n\nA major development in the refounding of the concept of infinitesimal\ntook place in the 1970s with the emergence of synthetic\ndifferential geometry, also known as smooth infinitesimal\nanalysis\n (SIA).[47]\n Based on the ideas of the American mathematician F. W. Lawvere, and\nemploying the methods of category theory, smooth infinitesimal\nanalysis provides an image of the world in which the continuous is an\nautonomous notion, not explicable in terms of the discrete. It\nprovides a rigorous framework for mathematical analysis in which every\nfunction between spaces is smooth (i.e., differentiable arbitrarily\nmany times, and so in particular continuous) and in which the use of\nlimits in defining the basic notions of the calculus is replaced by\nnilpotent infinitesimals, that is, of quantities so small\n(but not actually zero) that some power\u2014most usefully, the\nsquare\u2014vanishes. Since in SIA all functions are continuous, it\nembodies in a striking way Leibniz\u2019s principle of continuity\nNatura non facit saltus.\n\nIn what follows, we use bold \\(\\bR\\) to distinguish the real line in\nSIA from its counterparts in classical and constructive analysis. In\nthe usual development of the calculus, for any differentiable function\n\\(f\\) on the real line \\(\\bR, y = f(x)\\), it follows from\nTaylor\u2019s theorem that the increment \\(\\delta y = f(x + \\delta x)\n- f(x)\\) in \\(y\\) attendant upon an increment \\(\\delta x\\) in \\(x\\) is\ndetermined by an equation of the form \n\n\\[\\tag{1}\n\\delta y = f '(x)\\delta x + A(\\delta x)^2,\\] \n\n\nwhere \\(f '(x)\\) is the derivative of \\(f(x)\\) and \\(A\\) is a quantity\nwhose value depends on both \\(x\\) and \\(\\delta x\\). Now if it were\npossible to take \\(\\delta x\\) so small (but not demonstrably\nidentical with 0) that \\((\\delta x)^2 = 0\\) then (1) would assume the\nsimple form \n\n\\[\\tag{2}\nf(x + \\delta x) - f(x) = \\delta y = f '(x) \\delta x.\\]\n\n\nWe shall call a quantity having the property that its square is zero a\nnilsquare infinitesimal or simply a microquantity.\nIn SIA \u201cenough\u201d microquantities are present to ensure that\nequation (2) holds nontrivially for arbitrary\nfunctions \\(f: \\bR \\rightarrow \\bR\\). (Of course (2) holds trivially\nin standard mathematical analysis because there 0 is the sole\nmicroquantity in this sense.) The meaning of the term\n\u201cnontrivial\u201d here may be explicated in following way. If\nwe replace \\(\\delta x\\) by the letter \\(\\varepsilon\\) standing for an\narbitrary microquantity, (2) assumes the form\n\n\n\\[\\tag{3}\nf(x + \\varepsilon) - f(x) = \\varepsilon f '(x).\\]\n\n\n\nIdeally, we want the validity of this equation to be independent of\n\\(\\varepsilon\\) , that is, given \\(x\\), for it to hold for\nall microquantities \\(\\varepsilon\\). In that case the\nderivative \\(f '(x)\\) may be defined as the unique quantity\n\\(D\\) such that the equation \n\n\\[f(x + \\varepsilon) - f(x) = \\varepsilon D\\]\n\n\nholds for all microquantities \\(\\varepsilon\\).\n\nSetting \\(x = 0\\) in this equation, we get in particular\n\n\\[\\tag{4}\nf(\\varepsilon) = f(0) + \\varepsilon D,\\]\n\n\nfor all \\(\\varepsilon\\). It is equation (4) that is taken\nas axiomatic in smooth infinitesimal analysis. Let us write\n\\(\\Delta\\) for the set of microquantities, that is, \n\n\\[\\Delta = \\{x: x \\in \\bR \\land x^2 = 0\\}.\\]\n\n\nThen it is postulated that, for any \\(f: \\Delta \\rightarrow \\bR\\),\nthere is a unique \\(D \\in \\bR\\) such that equation (4) holds\nfor all \\(\\varepsilon\\). This says that the graph of \\(f\\) is a\nstraight line passing through \\((0, f\\)(0)) with slope \\(\\Delta\\).\nThus any function on \\(\\Delta\\) is what mathematicians term\naffine, and so this postulate is naturally termed the\nprinciple of microaffineness. It means that\n\\(\\Delta\\) cannot be bent or broken: it is subject only to\ntranslations and rotations\u2014and yet is not (as it would\nhave to be in ordinary analysis) identical with a point. \\(\\Delta\\)\nmay be thought of as an entity possessing position and attitude, but\nlacking true extension.\n\nNow consider the space \\(\\Delta^{\\Delta}\\) of maps from \\(\\Delta\\) to\nitself. It follows from the microaffineness principle that the\nsubspace \\((\\Delta^{\\Delta})_0\\) of \\(\\Delta^{\\Delta}\\) consisting of\nmaps vanishing at 0 is isomorphic to\n \\(\\bR\\).[48]\n The space \\(\\Delta^{\\Delta}\\) is a\n monoid[49]\n under composition which may be regarded as acting on \\(\\Delta\\) by\nevaluation: for \\(f \\in \\Delta^{\\Delta},\\) \\(f \\cdot \\varepsilon = f\n(\\varepsilon)\\). Its subspace \\((\\Delta^{\\Delta})_0\\) is a submonoid\nnaturally identified as the space of ratios of\nmicroquantities. The isomorphism between \\((\\Delta^{\\Delta})_0\\)\nand \\(\\bR\\) noted above is easily seen to be an isomorphism of monoids\n(where \\(\\bR\\) is considered a monoid under its usual multiplication).\nIt follows that \\(\\bR\\) itself may be regarded as the space of ratios\nof microquantities. This was essentially the view of Euler, who\nregarded (real) numbers as representing the possible results of\ncalculating the ratio 0/0. For this reason Lawvere has suggested that\n\\(\\bR\\) be called the space of Euler reals.\n\nIf we think of a function \\(y = f(x)\\) as defining a curve, then, for\nany \\(a\\), the image under \\(f\\) of the \u201cmicrointerval\u201d\n\\(\\Delta + a\\) obtained by translating \\(\\Delta\\) to \\(a\\) is straight\nand coincides with the tangent to the curve at \\(x = a\\). In this\nsense each curve is \u201cinfinitesimally straight\u201d.\n\nFrom the principle of microaffineness we deduce the important\nprinciple of microcancellation, viz. \n\n\\[\n\\text{If } \\varepsilon a = \\varepsilon b \\text{ for all } \\varepsilon, \\text{ then } a = b.\n\\]\n\n\nFor the premise asserts that the graph of the function \\(g: \\Delta\n\\rightarrow \\bR\\) defined by \\(g(\\varepsilon) = a \\varepsilon\\) has\nboth slope \\(a\\) and slope \\(b\\): the uniqueness condition in the\nprinciple of microaffineness then gives \\(a = b\\). The principle of\nmicrocancellation supplies the exact sense in which there are\n\u201cenough\u201d infinitesimals in smooth infinitesimal\nanalysis.\n\nFrom the principle of microaffineness it also follows that all\nfunctions on \\(\\bR\\) are continuous, that is, send\nneighboring points to neighboring points. Here two points \\(x,\ny\\) on \\(\\bR\\) are said to be neighbors if \\(x - y\\) is in \\(\\Delta\\),\nthat is, if \\(x\\) and \\(y\\) differ by a microquantity. To see this,\ngiven \\(f: \\bR \\rightarrow \\bR\\) and neighboring points \\(x, y\\), note\nthat \\(y = x + \\varepsilon\\) with \\(\\varepsilon\\) in \\(\\Delta\\), so\nthat \n\n\\[\n\\begin{align}\nf(y) - f(x) & = f(x + \\varepsilon) - f(x)\\\\\n& = \\varepsilon f '(x).\\\\\n\\end{align}\n\\]\n\n\nBut clearly any multiple of a microquantity is also a microquantity,\nso \\(\\varepsilon f '(x)\\) is a microquantity, and the result\nfollows.\n\nIn fact, since equation\n (3)\n holds for any \\(f\\), it also holds for its derivative \\(f '\\); it\nfollows that functions in smooth infinitesimal analysis are\ndifferentiable arbitrarily many times, thereby justifying the use of\nthe term \u201csmooth\u201d.\n\nLet us derive a basic law of the differential calculus, the\nproduct rule: \n\n\\[(fg)' = f'g + fg'.\\]\n\n\nTo do this we compute \n\n\\[\n\\begin{align}\n(fg)(x + \\varepsilon) & = (fg)(x) + \\varepsilon(fg)'(x) \\\\\n& = f(x)g(x) + \\varepsilon(fg)'(x),\\\\\n(fg)(x + \\varepsilon) & = f(x + \\varepsilon)g(x + \\varepsilon) \\\\\n& = [f(x) + f'(x)]\\cdot[g(x) + g'(x)]\\\\\n& = f(x)g(x) + \\varepsilon(f'g + fg') + \\varepsilon^2 f'g'\\\\\n& = f(x)g(x) + \\varepsilon(f'g + fg'),\n\\end{align}\n\\]\n\n\nsince \\(\\varepsilon^2 = 0\\). Therefore \\(\\varepsilon(fg)' =\n\\varepsilon(f'g + fg')\\), and the result follows by\nmicrocancellation.\n\nA stationary point \\(a\\) in \\(\\bR\\) of a function \\(f\\):\n\\(\\bR \\rightarrow \\bR\\) is defined to be one in whose vicinity\n\u201cinfinitesimal variations\u201d fail to change the value of\n\\(f\\), that is, such that \\(f(a + \\varepsilon) = f(a)\\) for all\n\\(\\varepsilon\\). This means that \\(f(a) + \\varepsilon f '(a)= f(a)\\),\nso that \\(\\varepsilon f'(a) = 0\\) for all \\(\\varepsilon\\), whence it\nfollows from microcancellation that \\(f'(a) = 0\\). This is\nFermat\u2019s rule.\n\nAn important postulate concerning stationary points that we adopt in\nsmooth infinitesimal analysis is the\n\nConstancy Principle. If every point in an interval \\(J\\) is a\nstationary point of \\(f: J \\rightarrow \\bR\\) (that is, if \\(f'\\) is\nidentically 0), then \\(f\\) is constant.\n\n\nPut succinctly, \u201cuniversal local constancy implies global\nconstancy\u201d. It follows from this that two functions with\nidentical derivatives differ by at most a constant.\n\nIn ordinary analysis the continuum \\(\\bR\\) is connected in the sense\nthat it cannot be split into two non empty subsets neither of which\ncontains a limit point of the other. In smooth infinitesimal analysis\nit has the vastly stronger property of indecomposability: it\ncannot be split in any way whatsoever into two disjoint\nnonempty subsets. For suppose \\(\\bR = U \\cup V\\) with \\(U \\cap V =\n\\varnothing\\). Define \\(f: \\bR \\rightarrow \\{0, 1\\}\\) by \\(f(x) = 1\\)\nif \\(x \\in U, f(x) = 0\\) if \\(x \\in V\\). We claim that \\(f\\) is\nconstant. For we have \n\n\\[(f(x) = 0 \\text{ or } f(x) = 1) \\amp(f(x + \\varepsilon) = 0 \\text{ or } f(x + \\varepsilon) = 1).\\]\n\n\nThis gives four possibilities:\n\n \\(f(x) = 0 \\wamp f(x + \\varepsilon) = 0\\) \n \\(f(x) = 0 \\wamp f(x + \\varepsilon) = 1\\)\n \\(f(x) = 1 \\wamp f(x + \\varepsilon) = 0\\)\n \\(f(x) = 1 \\wamp f(x + \\varepsilon) = 1\\)\n\n\nPossibilities (ii) and (iii) may be ruled out because \\(f\\) is\ncontinuous. This leaves (i) and (iv), in either of which \\(f(x) = f(x\n+ \\varepsilon)\\). So \\(f\\) is locally, and hence globally, constant,\nthat is, constantly 1 or 0. In the first case \\(V = \\varnothing\\) ,\nand in the second \\(U = \\varnothing\\).\n\nWe observe that the postulates of smooth infinitesimal analysis are\nincompatible with the law of excluded middle of classical\nlogic. This incompatibility can be demonstrated in two ways, one\ninformal and the other rigorous. First the informal argument. Consider\nthe function \\(f\\) defined for real numbers \\(x\\) by \\(f(x) = 1\\) if\n\\(x = 0\\) and \\(f(x) = 0\\) whenever \\(x \\ne 0\\). If the law of\nexcluded middle held, each real number would then be either equal or\nunequal to 0, so that the function \\(f\\) would be defined on the whole\nof \\(\\bR\\). But, considered as a function with domain \\(\\bR,\\) \\(f\\)\nis clearly discontinuous. Since, as we know, in smooth infinitesimal\nanalysis every function on \\(\\bR\\) is continuous, \\(f\\) cannot have\ndomain \\(\\bR\\)\n there.[50]\n So the law of excluded middle fails in smooth infinitesimal analysis.\nTo put it succinctly, universal continuity implies the failure of\nthe law of excluded middle.\n\nHere now is the rigorous argument. We show that the failure of the law\nof excluded middle can be derived from the principle of infinitesimal\ncancellation. To begin with, if \\(x \\ne 0\\), then \\(x^2 \\ne 0\\), so\nthat, if \\(x^2 = 0\\), then necessarily not \\(x \\ne 0\\). This means\nthat\n\n(*)\n for all infinitesimal \\(\\varepsilon\\), not \\(\\varepsilon \\ne\n0\\). \n\n\nNow suppose that the law of excluded middle were to hold. Then we\nwould have, for any \\(\\varepsilon\\), either \\(\\varepsilon = 0\\) or\n\\(\\varepsilon \\ne 0\\). But (*) allows us to eliminate the second\nalternative, and we infer that, for all \\(\\varepsilon\\), \\(\\varepsilon\n= 0\\). This may be written\n\n\nfor all \\(\\varepsilon\\), \\(\\varepsilon \\cdot 1 = \\varepsilon\n\\cdot 0\\),\n\n\nfrom which we derive by microcancellation the falsehood \\(1 = 0\\). So\nagain the law of excluded middle must fail.\n\nThe \u201cinternal\u201d logic of smooth infinitesimal analysis is\naccordingly not full classical logic. It is, instead,\nintuitionistic logic, that is, the logic derived from the\nconstructive interpretation of mathematical assertions. In our brief\nsketch we did not notice this \u201cchange of logic\u201d because,\nlike much of elementary mathematics, the topics we discussed are\nnaturally treated by constructive means such as direct\ncomputation.\n\nWhat are the algebraic and order structures on\n\\(\\bR\\) in SIA? As far as the former is concerned, there is little\ndifference from the classical situation: in SIA \\(\\bR\\) is equipped\nwith the usual addition and multiplication operations under which it\nis a field. In particular, \\(\\bR\\) satisfies the condition that each\n\\(x \\ne 0\\) has a multiplicative inverse. Notice, however, that since\nin SIA no microquantity (apart from 0 itself) is provably \\(\\ne 0\\),\nmicroquantities are not required to have multiplicative inverses (a\nrequirement which would lead to inconsistency). From a strictly\nalgebraic standpoint, \\(\\bR\\) in SIA differs from its classical\ncounterpart only in being required to satisfy the principle of\ninfinitesimal cancellation.\n\nThe situation is different, however, as regards the order structure of\n\\(\\bR\\) in SIA. Because of the failure of the law of excluded middle,\nthe order relation \\(\\lt\\) on \\(\\bR\\) in SIA cannot satisfy the\ntrichotomy law \n\n\\[x \\lt y \\wlor y \\lt x \\wlor x = y,\\]\n\n\nand accordingly \\(\\lt\\) must be a partial, rather than a\ntotal ordering. Since microquantities do not have\nmultiplicative inverses, and \\(\\bR\\) is a field, any microquantity\n\\(\\varepsilon\\) must satisfy \n\n\\[\\neg \\varepsilon \\lt 0  \\wland \\neg \\varepsilon \\gt 0.\\]\n\n\nAccordingly, if we define the relation \\(\\lt\\) by \\(x \\lt y\\) iff\n\\(\\neg(y \\lt x)\\), then, for any microquantity \\(\\varepsilon\\) we\nhave \n\n\\[\\varepsilon \\le 0  \\wland \\varepsilon \\ge 0.\\]\n\n\nUsing these ideas we can identify three infinitesimal\nneighborhoods of 0 on \\(\\bR\\) in SIA, each of which is included\nin its successor. First, the set \\(\\Delta\\) of microquantities itself,\nnext, the set \\(I = \\{x \\in \\bR : \\neg x \\ne 0\\}\\) of elements\nindistinguishable from 0; finally, the set  \n\n\\[ J = \\{x \\in \\bR : x \\le 0 \\wland x \\ge 0\\}\\]\n\n\nof elements neither less nor greater than 0. These three may be\nthought of as the infinitesimal neighborhoods of 0 defined\nalgebraically, logically, and order-theoretically,\nrespectively.\n\nIn certain models of SIA the system of natural numbers\npossesses some subtle and intriguing features which make it possible\nto introduce another type of infinitesimal\u2014the so-called\ninvertible infinitesimals\u2014resembling those of\nnonstandard analysis, whose presence engenders yet another\ninfinitesimal neighborhood of 0 properly containing all those\nintroduced above.\n\nIn SIA the set \\(\\bN \\) of natural numbers can be defined to be the\nsmallest subset of \\(\\bR\\) which contains 0 and is closed under the\noperation of adding 1. In some models of SIA, \\(\\bR\\) satisfies the\nArchimedean principle that every real number is majorized by\na natural number. However, models of SIA have been constructed\n(Moerdijk & Reyes 1991) in which \\(\\bR\\) is not Archimedean in\nthis sense. In these models it is more natural to consider, in place\nof \\(\\bN \\), the set \\(\\bNs\\) of smooth natural numbers\ndefined by \n\n\\[\\bN^* = \\{x \\in \\bR: 0 \\le x \\wland  \\sin \\pi x = 0\\}.\\]\n\n\n\\(\\bNs\\) is the set of points of intersection of the smooth curve \\(y\n= \\sin \\pi x\\) with the positive \\(x\\)-axis. In these models \\(\\bR\\)\ncan be shown to possess the Archimedean property provided that in\nthe definition \\(\\bN \\) is replaced by \\(\\bNs\\). In these models,\nthen, \\(\\bN \\) is a proper subset of \\(\\bNs\\): the members of \\(\\bNs -\n\\bN \\) may be considered nonstandard integers. Multiplicative\ninverses of nonstandard integers are infinitesimals, but, being\nthemselves invertible, they are of a different type from the ones we\nhave considered so far. It is quite easy to show that they, as well as\nthe infinitesimals in \\(J\\) (and so also those in \\(\\Delta\\) and\n\\(I)\\) are all contained in the set\u2014a further infinitesimal\nneighborhood of 0\u2014 \n\n\\[K = \\{x \\in \\bR: \\forall n \\in \\bN (-\\tfrac{1}{n} \\lt x \\lt \\tfrac{1}{n})\\}\\]\n\n\nof infinitely small elements of \\(\\bR\\). The members of the\nset \n\n\\[\\In = \\{x \\in K: x \\ne 0\\}\\]\n\n\nof invertible elements of \\(K\\) are naturally identified as\ninvertible infinitesimals. Being obtained as inverses of\n\u201cinfinitely large\u201d reals (i.e., reals \\(r\\) satisfying\n\\(\\forall n\\in \\bN (n \\lt r) \\lor \\forall n\\in \\bN (r \\lt -n)\\)) the\nmembers of \\(\\In\\) are the counterparts in SIA of the infinitesimals\nof nonstandard analysis.\n\nFinally, a brief word on the models of SIA. These are the\nso-called smooth toposes, categories (see entry on\n category theory)\n of a certain kind in which all the usual mathematical operations can\nbe performed but whose internal logic is intuitionistic and in which\nevery map between spaces is smooth, that is, differentiable without\nlimit. It is this \u201cuniversal smoothness\u201d that makes the\npresence of infinitesimal objects such as \\(\\Delta\\) possible. The\nconstruction of smooth toposes (Moerdijk & Reyes 1991) guarantees\nthe consistency of SIA with intuitionistic logic. This is so despite\nthe evident fact that SIA is not consistent with classical logic.\n",
