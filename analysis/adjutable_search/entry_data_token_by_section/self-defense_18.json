    "main_text": "Defending Others || Other-Defense and Consent\n6.3 Other-Defense and Consent\nSeveral theorists argue that defending others is subject to an additional moral requirement: that the beneficiary of defense must consent to being defended (or, more plausibly, that the beneficiary must not validly refuse) (Fabre 2009b: 159\u2013160; Finlay 2010: 292; Parry 2017: 358).\nThere are different ways of understanding the rationale behind the consent requirement. On one view, the right to use defensive force initially applies only to the victim of aggression. In order for third-parties to be permitted to use force against the aggressor, this right must be \u201ctransferred\u201d by the victim (Fabre 2009b: 158). An alternative approach focuses on the victim\u2019s welfare, rather than their rights (Parry 2017: 370\u2013376). On this view, the consent requirement is grounded in the anti-paternalist idea that we may not act \u201cfor the good\u201d of another person if they refuse to be benefited (on paternalism, see Dworkin 2002 [2020]). If a victim validly refuses defensive assistance, then defenders cannot justify harming the aggressor by appeal to the benefit it would provide to the victim.\nThe consent requirement rests on the idea that victims occupy a privileged position within the ethics of defensive harm: It\u2019s their rights and interests that are at stake, so they get to decide whether they are defended. One important objection denies that victims have exclusive control over whether others may act on justifications for harming aggressors. For example, one might argue that victims\u2019 lives and interests are agent-neutrally valuable, and so any agent may act to preserve that value, regardless of the victim\u2019s will (Lazar 2016: 217). The plausibility of this objection will depend on its implications in other cases of non-consensual benefiting. Alternatively, one might argue that we have moral reasons to prevent wrongful attacks that are distinct from the moral reasons to protect victim\u2019s lives and welfare. Perhaps wrongdoing is impersonally bad (Parfit 2017: 354\u2013357; see also, Kamm 2014: 75\u201376) or bad for the wrongdoer (Tadros 2016c: 1\u20132, 164; Brownlee 2019). Either way, the consent sceptic can say to the victim: \u201cit\u2019s not all about you!\u201d The success of these objections will depend on whether these alternative moral reasons for defending victims are sufficiently strong to justify harming and killing (for skepticism, see Parry 2017: 379\u2013382; Oberman 2020: 447\u2013452).\nOne interesting puzzle about the consent requirement is how it applies in cases where multiple victims are threatened, and some victims refuse while others do not. One obvious answer is to adopt a majoritarian interpretation of the consent requirement. But this view generates counter-intuitive results. Consider the following example:\n\nAbuse: Your alcoholic neighbor is mercilessly beating his five adult children. You can rescue the children by defensively harming the neighbor. Four children explicitly and competently refuse defense, while one consents. Are you required to defer to the wishes of the majority in this case? (adapted from Altman & Wellman 2008: 244)\n\nMany find it intuitive that defense would be permissible, despite the refusal of the majority. This tracks the more general idea that individuals\u2019 basic rights place limits on majority rule. Reflection on this kind of case has led many to conclude that the consent requirement imposes only a minimal constraint in multiple victim cases: Provided some member(s) of the victim group do(es) not validly refuse, the consent requirement is satisfied (Altman & Wellman 2008: 243\u2013245; McMahan 2010: 52; Frowe 2014b: 109).\nThis skepticism has recently been challenged in favor of a more robust interpretation of the requirement (Parry 2017). On this view, if a victim validly refuses defensive assistance, we must exclude the benefit of rescue to that victim when evaluating whether the use of force is proportionate. Defending a group is permissible only if the benefits to the non-refusing victims is sufficient to render defense proportionate. Hence, this is known as the \u201cProportionate Consent Requirement\u201d (PCR).\nThe PCR captures the judgment that other-defense is permissible in Abuse. Since it would be proportionate to harm the father in order to defend just one victim, it is permissible to do so provided one victim consents. However, in other cases the justification for defending a group does requires appealing to the good of many victims (and potentially every victim). Consider:\n\nElevator: Five Victims are riding in an elevator. Aggressor begins to saw through the elevator cable in order kill Victims. Rescuer is able to kill Aggressor by throwing a grenade, thereby saving Victims. However, the blast from the grenade will kill innocent Bystander as a side-effect (Parry 2017: 385).\n\nLet\u2019s assume that it is permissible to kill one innocent person as a side-effect of saving five innocent persons, but not four. In Elevator, the permissibility of using defensive force involves appealing to the good of every member of the victim group. However, since four members have refused intervention on their behalf, the PCR holds that this refusal renders it impermissible to intervene. The good of the single consenting member of the group is insufficient to justify killing the innocent bystander as a side-effect. Indeed, in this case, the PCR holds that defense is only permissible if every victim consents (or does not validly refuse).\nOne important worry for the PCR is whether it is vulnerable to the same objection that plagued the majoritarian view. If it is objectionable to give a majority the power to veto the defense of a consenting minority, it seems even more objectionable to give a minority of dissenting victims the power to veto the defense of a much larger number of victims.\n",
