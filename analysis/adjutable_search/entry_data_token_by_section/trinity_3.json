    "main_text": "One-self Theories || One-self Theories and \u201cModalism\u201d in Theology\n1.3 One-self Theories and \u201cModalism\u201d in Theology\n\nInfluential 20th century theologians Karl Barth (1886\u20131968) and\nKarl Rahner (1904\u201384) endorse one-self Trinity theories, and\nsuggest replacements for the term \u201cPerson\u201d. They argue\nthat in modern times \u201cperson\u201d has come to mean a self. But\nthree divine selves would be three gods. Hence, even if\n\u201cPerson\u201d should be retained as traditional, its meaning in\nthe context of the Trinity should be expounded using phrases like\n\u201cmodes of being\u201d (Barth) or \u201cmanners of\nsubsisting\u201d (Rahner) (Ovey 2008, 203\u201313; Rahner 1997,\n42\u20135, 103\u201315).\n\nBarth\u2019s own summary of his position is:\n\nAs God is in Himself Father from all eternity, He begets Himself as\nthe Son from all eternity. As He is the Son from all eternity, He is\nbegotten of Himself as the Father from all eternity. In this eternal\nbegetting of Himself and being begotten of Himself, He posits Himself\na third time as the Holy Spirit, that is, as the love which unites Him\nin Himself. (Barth 1956, 1)\n\n\nAll of Barth\u2019s capitalized pronouns here refer to one and the\nsame self, the self-revealing God, eternally existing in three ways.\nSimilarly, Rahner says that God\n\n\u2026is \u2013 at once and necessarily \u2013 the unoriginate who\nmediates himself to himself (Father), the one who is in truth uttered\nfor himself (Son), and the one who is received and accepted in love\nfor himself (Spirit) \u2013 and\u2026 as a result of this,\nhe [i.e. God] is the one who can freely communicate himself. (Rahner\n1997, 101\u20132)\n\n\nSimilarly, theologian Alastair McGrath writes that\n\n\u2026when we talk about God as one person, we mean one person\nin the modern sense of the word [i.e. a self], and when we\ntalk about God as three persons, we mean three persons in the\nancient sense of the word [i.e. a persona or role that is\nplayed]. (McGrath 1988, 131)\n\n\nAll three theologians are assuming that the three modes of God are all\nessential and maximally overlapping.\n\nMainstream Christian theologians nearly always reject\n\u201cmodalism\u201d, meaning a one-self theory like that of\nSabellius (fl. 220), an obscure figure who was thought to teach that\nthe Father, Son, and Holy Spirit are sequential, non-essential modes,\nsomething like ways God interacts with his creation. Thus, in one\nepoch, God exists in the mode of Father, during the first century he\nexists as Son, and then after Christ\u2019s resurrection and\nascension, he exists as Holy Spirit (Leftow 2004, 327; McGrath 2007,\n254\u20135; Pelikan 1971, 179). Sabellian modalism is usually\nrejected on the grounds that such modes are strictly sequential, or\nbecause they are not intrinsic features of God, or because they are\nintrinsic but not essential features of God. The first aspect of\nSabellian modalism conflicts with episodes in the New Testament where\nthe three appear simultaneously, such as the Baptism of Jesus in\nMatthew 3:16\u20137. The last two are widely held to be objectionable\nbecause it is held that a doctrine of the Trinity should tell us about\nhow God really is, not merely about how God appears, or because a\ntrinitarian doctrine should express (some of) God\u2019s essence.\nSabellian and other ancient modalists are sometimes called\n\u201cmonarchians\u201d because they upheld the sole monarchy of the\nFather, or \u201cpatripassians\u201d for their (alleged) acceptance\nof the view that the Father (and not only the Son) suffered in the\nlife of the man Jesus.\n\nWhile Sabellian one-self theories were rejected for the reasons above,\nthese reasons don\u2019t rule out all one-self Trinity theories, such\nas ones positing the Three as God\u2019s modes in the sense of his\neternally having certain intrinsic and essential features. Sometimes\nthe Trinity doctrine is expounded by theologians as meaning just this,\nthe creedal formulas being interpreted as asserting that God\n(non-contingently) acts as Creator, Redeemer, and Comforter, or\ndescribing \u201cGod as transcendent abyss, God as particular yet\nunbounded intelligence, and God as the immanent creative energy of\nbeing\u2026 three distinct ways of being God\u201d, with the named\nmodes being intrinsic and essential to God, and not mere ways that God\nappears (Ward 2002, 236; cf. Ward 2000, 90; Ward 2015).\n",
