Nonetheless, theistic\nmystics typically claim that experiences of God\u2019s activity do\nnot result from their own endeavors. So too, most mystics are not\ninvolved in theurgic activity. The Jewish Kabbalah is the most\nprominent form of theurgic mysticism. In it, the mystic aims to bring\nabout a modification in the inner life of the Godhead (see\nIdel 1988).\n",
