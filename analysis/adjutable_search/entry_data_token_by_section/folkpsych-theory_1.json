    "main_text": "Varieties of Theory Theory || Modular Theory Theory\n2.1 Modular Theory Theory\n\nA popular explanatory proposal in cognitive science is that ToM laws\nor principles are instantiated or contained in a mental module, which\nis understood to be a special kind of cognitive device, gadget, or\nmechanism. A ToM module is solely dedicated to the special work of\nenabling us to predict and explain the actions of others by accurately\nattributing mental state contents to them. The common denominator in\nall TT modularist accounts is that ToM abilities, and by extension our\nFP competence, are best explained by a cognitive architecture with a\nparticular design and a dedicated, domain-specific function (Fodor\n1995; Segal 1996; Leslie, Friedman, & German 2004; Carruthers\n2006; Heyes 2018).\n\nFor some, the most important feature of modules, which separates them\nfrom other humdrum psychological mechanisms, is that they are assumed\nto be cognitive through and through. Fodor (1983), for example,\nmaintains that the knowledge base of ToM modules is conceptually based\nand has the structure and content of a set of semantically connected\npropositionally articulated principles. In line with this view, Fodor\n(1994, 1998) proposes that the core mentalistic concepts get their\nmeaning denotationally by means of special mechanisms that \u201clock\non\u201d to the relevant extensions. These concepts each play\ndistinctive roles in constituting the principles that make up the\nnetwork of laws comprising our folk theory of mind.\n\nA defining feature of mental modules, as per Fodor\u2019s (1983)\noriginal formulation, is that they are informationally encapsulated.\nInformation contained in each module is encapsulated from other\nmodules and encapsulated from the information available in the\ncognitive system. Modules have limited cognitive interests and\nconcerns: they operate on a strictly need-to-know basis. Because of\ntheir informationally encapsulated limited interests, ToM modules are\nnot informed and updated by the subject\u2019s wider set of\nbackground knowledge. It is assumed that modules work better and\nfaster by restricting their concerns to specialized dealings with only\ncertain topics.\n\nAccordingly, each type of mental module is assumed to be restricted to\ndealing only with the subject matter of its specialist concern.\nModules are domain-specific in the sense that only a circumscribed\nclass of inputs will activate them. Because they are thought to do\nsuch specialized work, ToM modules are dissociable: they can be\nselectively impaired, damaged, or disabled without affecting the\noperation of other systems and vice versa. Some argue that this\nfeature of ToM modules makes them particularly well suited to explain\nimpaired mindreading abilities exhibited by those with specific\nconditions. Such atypical cognitive profiles are hypothesized to be\nrooted in the damaged or malfunctioning neurocognitive machinery of a\nToM module. It has been hypothesized that impaired ToM modules are\nresponsible for the specific profiles of FP abilities displayed by\ncognitively diverse individuals \u2014 those with specific\npsychopathologies such as autism spectrum disorder, schizophrenia, and\nborderline personality disorder (e.g., Baron-Cohen, Leslie, &\nFrith 1985; Ozonoff, Pennington, & Rogers 1991; Frith 1992;\nBaron-Cohen 1995, 2000; Corcoran 2000; Br\u00fcne 2005; Sprong et al.\n2007, Fonagy & Luyten 2009; Arntz et al. 2009; Franzen et al.\n2011).\n\nSeveral practitioners and theorists question the explanatory value of\nattempts to explain various psychological conditions in terms of\nimpaired ToM modules (see, e.g., Hobson 1991, 2002; Williams 2004;\nShanker 2004; Belmonte 2009). Neurodiversity advocates argue that the\nentire framework of appealing to ToM deficits to explain putative\npsychopathological disorders is offensive. They hold that the atypical\ncognitive differences which are designated as psychopathologies should\nnot be characterized as cognitive deficits or disorders at all.\nInstead, we should merely recognize that there are diverse cognitive\nstyles associated with particular atypical cognitive profiles and that\nsome of these profiles have special advantages (see Yergeau 2013, and\nalso Rosqvist, Chown, & Stenning [eds] 2020 for a set of critical\npapers along these lines).\n\nA common denominator for those who posit the existence of ToM modules\nis that they assume that these mental devices are the means by which\neveryday social cognition is normally conducted by unimpaired members\nof our species. Beyond this point of agreement, advocates of\nModularist TT propose importantly different theories about the origins\nof ToM modules and how they are acquired.\n\nSome TT modularists are nativists. They assume that a ToM is a species\nuniversal, biologically inherited device forged in our pre-history.\nSuch modularists hold that a ToM comes with core concepts built-in as\nstandard for all normally developing members of our species (Fodor\n1983, Baron-Cohen 1999, Mithen 1996, 2000\u2014see Fenici &\nGarofoli 2017 for an alternative reading of the pre-historic\nevidence).\n\nToM nativism is compatible with the possibility that the development\nof ToM modules is shaped by environmental input. There are versions of\nmodular ToM theory that emphasize the role of the developmental\nenvironment in shaping children\u2019s ToMs. However, such versions\nof modularism hold that children are pre-set to acquire mentalistic\nconcepts automatically through a process of triggering and tuning when\nappropriately stimulated (Segal 1996; Scholl & Leslie 1999).\n\nOther TT modularists hold that ToM modules are acquired during\nontogeny, proposing that FP is enabled by an \u201cacquired\nmodule\u201d\u2014one that forms through the interaction of various\nin-built abilities with the social environment during development\n(Karmiloff-Smith 1995; Garfield, Peterson, & Perry 2001).\n\nThe idea of an acquired module opens up the possibility that our\neveryday ToM is a specialized neurocognitive mechanism, a cognitive\ngadget, that is embedded in our nervous systems through culturally\ninherited processes rather than by processes of natural selection\n(Heyes & Frith 2014; Heyes 2018). This proposal builds on the\nniche construction hypothesis that sociocultural practices construct\nand modify our environments in ways that are cognitively\nconsequential. To understand ToM as a culturally acquired module is to\nthink of it as akin to our culturally inherited capacities for print\nreading or literacy. These too cannot be explained by direct appeal to\ncognitive devices that may have been forged in the Pleistocene by\nnatural selection. Thinking of ToMs as culturally acquired cognitive\ngadgets opens up the possibilities that FP may not be pan-cultural,\nand that Lewis\u2019s platitudes may not be species universal.\n",
