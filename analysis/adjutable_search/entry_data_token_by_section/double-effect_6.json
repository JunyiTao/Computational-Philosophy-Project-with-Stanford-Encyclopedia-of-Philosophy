On his view, double\neffect \u201cdistinguishes between agency in which harm comes to some\nvictims, at least in part, from the agent\u2019s deliberately\ninvolving them in something in order to further his purpose precisely\nby way of their being so involved (agency in which they figure as\nintentional objects), and harmful agency in which either nothing is in\nthat way intended for the victims or what is so intended does not\ncontribute to their harm\u201d (1989, p. 343; see also Nelkin and\nRickless, 2014). Quinn explains that \u201cdirect agency requires\nneither that harm itself be useful nor that what is useful be causally\nconnected in some especially close way with the harm it helps bring\nabout\u201d (1989, p. 344). He acknowledges that \u201csome cases of\nharming that the doctrine intuitively speaks against are arguably not\ncases of intentional harming, precisely because neither the harm\nitself (nor anything itself causally very close to it) is\nintended\u201d (1991, p. 511).\n\nQuinn\u2019s reformulation of double effect is not absolutist in\ncharacter. He observes that a result brought about through direct\nagency might not be impermissible; instead it would require more\noffsetting benefit than the same result brought about through indirect\nagency in similar circumstances.\n\nQuinn\u2019s proposal would effectively broaden the category of\nresults that count as the more problematic form of direct agency in\ncausing harm. As a result, if we believe that some forms of direct\nagency that involve causing death are permissible, we will have to\nseek some other explanation than double effect\u2019s claim that the\nharms are indirect or merely foreseen. The soldier who throws himself\non the grenade in order to shield his fellow soldiers from the force\nof an explosion has directly involved himself in the protective\naction. Shelly Kagan (1999, 145) points out that if someone else were\nto shove the soldier on the grenade we would certainly say that that\nthe harm to the soldier was intended by the person who did the\nshoving, even if the shoving was intended to promote the goal of\nsaving the lives of others. Equally, we should say that it is intended\nin this case \u2013 not as a goal or as an end pursued for its own\nsake but as a means to an end. The same kind of argument can be made\nfor cases of killing in self-defense when overwhelming and lethal\nforce is used. If these are cases of permissible direct agency, and if\nQuinn is right that the distinction between direct and indirect agency\nexplains the intuitive appeal of double effect\u2019s contrast\nbetween intended means and foreseen side effects, then these cases\ncast doubt on the claim that double effect explains why the\nlife-saving actions in the Hysterectomy, Heroic Shielding and\nSelf-defense examples are permissible.\n",
