    "main_text": "Normative for what? || Logic as normative for reasoning\n2.1 Logic as normative for reasoning\n\nOne response\u2014perhaps the most common one\u2014is that logic\nsets forth norms for (theoretical) reasoning. Unlike\nthinking, which might consist merely of disconnected sequences of\nconceptual activity, reasoning is presumably a connected, usually\ngoal-directed, process by which we form, reinstate or revise doxastic\nattitudes (and perhaps other types of states) through inference.\nConsider the following two examples of how logic might give rise to\nnorms. First, suppose I am trying to find Ann and that I can be sure\nthat Ann is either in the museum or at the concert. I am now reliably\ninformed that she is not in the museum. Using logic, I conclude that\nAnn is at the concert. Thus, by inferring in conformity with the valid\n(by the standards of classical logic) logical principle of disjunctive\nsyllogism, I have arrived at a true belief about Ann\u2019s\nwhereabouts. Second, if I believe that Ann is either at the concert or\nthe museum, while at the same time disbelieving both of the disjuncts,\nit would seem that there is a tension in my belief set, which I have\nreason to rectify by revising my beliefs appropriately. Logic may thus\nbe thought to normatively constrain the ways we form and revise\ndoxastic attitudes. And it does so, presumably, in our everyday\ncognitive lives (as in our example), as well as in the context of more\nself-conscious forms of theoretical inquiry, as in mathematics, the\nsciences, law, philosophy and so on, where its normative grip on us\nwould seem to be even\n tighter.[5]\n\n",
