    "main_text": "Analyses of Disposition Ascriptions\n1. Analyses of Disposition Ascriptions\n\nMany terms have been used to describe what we mean by dispositions:\n\u2018power\u2019 (Locke\u2019s term), \u2018dunamis\u2019 (Aristotle\u2019s\nterm), \u2018ability\u2019, \u2018potency\u2019,\n\u2018capability\u2019, \u2018tendency\u2019,\n\u2018potentiality\u2019, \u2018proclivity\u2019,\n\u2018capacity\u2019, and so forth. In a very general sense, they\nmean disposition, or otherwise something close by. To avoid confusion,\nhowever, we will stick to the term \u2018disposition\u2019 (for a\nsubtle difference between dispositions and powers, see Bird 2016).\n\nAs noted earlier, philosophical interests in dispositions principally\ncentre around the issue of how to explain them in more readily\nunderstandable terms. This issue came to the prominence in the early\n20th century when philosophers aspired to construct an\nempiricist language in which all meaningful sentences including\ndispositional sentences can be analyzed in observational and\nextensional-logical terms. One early attempt at analyzing disposition\nascriptions on the empiricist program is made by Carnap (1928,\n1936\u20137) who considers the so-called reduction sentences as a way\nof introducing dispositional expressions into our language:\n\nR. \nFor each object \\(x\\), if \\(x\\) is put into water, it is\nsoluble iff it dissolves,\n\nwhere the conditional is understood as a material conditional. The\nidea behind \\(R\\) is that we can meaningfully tell whether or not a\ngiven item is soluble only if it is put into water. \\(R\\) thus provides\na rule for how to introduce the dispositional predicate\n\u2018soluble\u2019 in application to items that have in fact been\nput into water. But \\(R\\) is silent about whether \\(x\\) is soluble\nwhen it is not put into water, and this means that we cannot use \\(R\\)\nto completely eliminate the predicate \u2018soluble\u2019 from the\nlanguage. Though this is what Carnap explicitly embraced, many\nphilosophers found it deeply problematic. And so philosophers of\nempiricist leanings continued the search for a definition schema of\ndispositional expressions in an extensional language (Kaila 1939,\n1942; Storer 1951).\n\nNotwithstanding these attempts, however, it came to be widely accepted\nthat disposition ascriptions cannot be analyzed in an extensional\nlanguage (Burks 1951, 1955; Pap 1958; Sellars 1958). This had the\neffect of turning philosophers\u2019 attention to the connection\nbetween disposition ascriptions and counterfactual or subjunctive\nconditionals. In fact, it was generally recognised from the very\nbeginning of philosophical research about dispositions that\ndisposition ascriptions are closely linked with counterfactual\nconditionals: \u2018\\(x\\) is soluble at \\(t\\)\u2019 is\nassociated with \u2018\\(x\\) would dissolve if put into water at\n\\(t\\)\u2019. This idea, however, was overlooked for decades\npartly due to the then popular epistemology of radically empiricist\nkind and partly due to the lack of a proper semantic understanding of\ncounterfactual conditionals. But it later came to be brought into the\nspotlight largely due to the revival of the philosophy of modality\nfrom the early 1970s.
