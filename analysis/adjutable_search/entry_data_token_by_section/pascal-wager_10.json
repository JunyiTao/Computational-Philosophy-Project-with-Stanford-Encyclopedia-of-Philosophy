What Does It Mean to \u201cWager for God\u201d?\n\nLet us now grant Pascal that, all things considered (rationality and\nmorality included), you should wager for God. What exactly does this\ninvolve?\n\nA number of authors read Pascal as arguing that you should\nbelieve in God\u2014see e.g. Quinn 1994, and Jordan 1994a.\nBut perhaps one cannot simply believe in God at will; and rationality\ncannot require the impossible. Pascal is well aware of this objection:\n\u201c[I] am so made that I cannot believe. What, then, would you\nhave me do?\u201d, says his imaginary interlocutor. However, he\ncontends that one can take steps to cultivate such belief:\n\nYou would like to attain faith, and do not know the way; you would\nlike to cure yourself of unbelief, and ask the remedy for it. Learn of\nthose who have been bound like you, and who now stake all their\npossessions. These are people who know the way which you would follow,\nand who are cured of an ill of which you would be cured. Follow the\nway by which they began; by acting as if they believed, taking the\nholy water, having masses said, etc. \u2026\n\n\nBut to show you that this leads you there, it is this which will\nlessen the passions, which are your stumbling-blocks.\n\n\nWe find two main pieces of advice to the non-believer here: act like a\nbeliever, and suppress those passions that are obstacles to becoming a\nbeliever. And these are actions that one can perform at\nwill.\n\nBelieving in God is presumably one way to wager for God. This passage\nsuggests that even the non-believer can wager for God, by striving to\nbecome a believer. Critics may question the psychology of belief\nformation that Pascal presupposes, pointing out that one could strive\nto believe (perhaps by following exactly Pascal\u2019s prescription),\nyet fail. To this, a follower of Pascal might reply that the act of\ngenuine striving already displays a pureness of heart that God would\nfully reward.\n\nAccording to Pascal, \u2018wagering for God\u2019 and\n\u2018wagering against God\u2019 are contradictories, as there is no\navoiding wagering one way or another: \u201cyou must wager. It is not\noptional.\u201d The decision to wager for or against God is one that\nyou make at a time\u2014at \\(t\\), say. But of course Pascal does not\nthink that you would be infinitely rewarded for wagering for God\nmomentarily, then wagering against God thereafter; nor that you would\nbe infinitely rewarded for wagering for God sporadically\u2014only on\nthe last Thursday of each month, for example. What Pascal intends by\n\u2018wagering for God\u2019 is an ongoing action\u2014indeed, one\nthat continues until your death\u2014that involves your adopting a\ncertain set of practices and living the kind of life that fosters\nbelief in God. The decision problem for you at \\(t\\), then, is whether\nyou should embark on this course of action; to fail to do so is to\nwager against God at \\(t\\).\n",
