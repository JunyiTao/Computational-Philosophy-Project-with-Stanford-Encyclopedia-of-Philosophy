    "main_text": "The concept of impartiality\n1. The concept of impartiality\n\nIt is all too easy to assume that the word impartiality must denote a\npositive, unitary concept \u2013 presumably a concept closely linked\nwith, if not identical to, morality. This, however, is simply not the\ncase. Rather, there are various sorts of behavior that may be\ndescribed as \u2018impartial,\u2019 and some of these obviously have\nlittle or nothing to do with morality. A person who chooses an\naccountant on the basis of her friends\u2019 recommendations may be\nentirely impartial between the various candidates (members of the pool\nof local accountants) with respect to their gender, their age, or\nwhere they went to school. Yet if her choice is motivated solely by\nrational self-interested considerations then it is clear that the\nimpartiality she manifests is in no way a form of moral impartiality.\nTo take a more extreme case, consider an insane serial killer who\nchooses his victims on the basis of their resemblance to that some\ncelebrity. The killer may be impartial with respect to his\nvictims\u2019 occupations, religious beliefs, and so forth, but it\nwould be absurd to regard this as a form of moral impartiality.\n\nIt is also worth noting that some types of impartiality may in\nthemselves be immoral or morally questionable. Suppose that I decide\nto pass along a treasured family heirloom to one of my two sons, Bill\nand Phil. Flipping a coin would constitute one type of impartial\nprocedure for choosing between the two. But suppose that I have\nalready promised the heirloom to Phil on several occasions. In this\ncase it would be quite wrong to allow a coin toss to determine whether\nhe gets it. Deciding by means of a coin toss would be an impartial\nprocedure, but many would claim that it would be the wrong sort of\nimpartiality here, for it ignores the moral obligation created by my\nprevious promises.\n\nThe word \u2018impartiality\u2019, then, picks out a broad concept\nthat need not have anything to do with morality. In this broad sense,\nimpartiality is probably best characterized in a negative rather than\npositive manner: an impartial choice is simply one in which a certain\nsort of consideration (i.e. some property of the individuals being\nchosen between) has no influence. An analysis along these lines has\nbeen proposed by Bernard Gert, who holds that \u201cA is\nimpartial in respect R with regard to group G if and\nonly if A\u2019s actions in respect R are not\ninfluenced at all by which member(s) of G benefit or are\nharmed by these actions\u201d (Gert 1995, 104). Thus, for Gert,\nimpartiality is a property of a set of decisions made by a particular\nagent, directed toward a particular group.\n\nGert\u2019s analysis captures the important fact that one cannot\nsimply ask of a given agent whether or not she is impartial. Rather,\nwe must also specify with regard to whom she is impartial, and in what\nrespect. Gert\u2019s analysis, then, permits and indeed requires that\nwe make fairly fine-grained distinctions between various sorts of\nimpartiality. This is necessary, since one and the same agent might\nmanifest various sorts of partiality and impartiality towards various\ngroups of persons. Consider, for instance, a university professor who\nis also a mother of five children, and who is currently acting as a\nmember of a hiring committee. Such an agent might be impartial between\nher children with respect to the care they receive (while preferring\nher own children over others in this respect), and also impartial\nbetween the various job candidates; but it is clear that these two\nuses of the word \u2018impartial\u2019 denote very different\npractices. In particular, the idea of merit applies in one case but\nnot the other: to be impartial between job candidates is presumably to\nselect between them on the basis of merit, whereas to be impartial\nbetween one\u2019s children is not to think of merit at all,\nbut rather to provide equal protection and care to all.\n\nMany attempts to characterize impartiality fail to respect the\ndistinction between the broadest, most formalistic sense of the\nnotion, and a more specifically moral impartiality. To say, for\ninstance, that an impartial choice is one that is free of bias or\nprejudice is to presuppose that we are dealing with a certain sort of\nimpartiality, that which is required or recommended by morality, or at\nleast worthy of moral approbation. \u2018Bias\u2019 and\n\u2018prejudice\u2019 are loaded terms, suggesting not only that\nsome consideration is being excluded, but also that the exclusion is\nappropriate and warranted. Similarly, the idea that impartiality\nrequires that we give equal and/or adequate consideration to the\ninterests of all concerned parties goes well beyond the requirements\nof the merely formal notion. (In the coin toss case, it is quite clear\nthat Phil\u2019s claims to the heirloom are not being given equal or\nadequate consideration.) As a characterization of moral impartiality,\nhowever, this suggestion is perhaps more promising, at least in some\ncontexts.\n",
