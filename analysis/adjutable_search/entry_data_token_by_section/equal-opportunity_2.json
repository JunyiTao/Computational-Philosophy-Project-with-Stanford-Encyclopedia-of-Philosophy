    "main_text": "Formal Equality of Opportunity\n3. Formal Equality of Opportunity\n\nThe term Formal Equality of Opportunity is often used to pick out a\nparticular conception of Equality of Opportunity, but it may be better\nunderstood to refer to a family of conceptions under which\nEquality of Opportunity obtains when advantages are in some sense\n\u201copen to all\u201d, even though there are a potentially\nsignificant range of further background factors which will determine\nhow likely it is for individuals to be able to successfully secure\nthem. A particularly thin conception of Formal Equality of Opportunity\nmight hold that persons enjoy equal opportunities simply when there is\nno legal impediment or other coercive restriction on access to the\nposition or good. Laws against women serving in the military, for\ninstance, would mean that women lacked the Equality of Opportunity to\nserve, as would formal exclusion from consideration in the application\nprocess, or women being coercively intimidated not to apply to serve.\nOn this view of Equality of Opportunity, the only factors which render\nthe opportunities unequal are certain restrictions on the freedom of\nsome individuals to compete for or access the position or good in\nquestion.\n\nA slightly thicker conception of Equality of Opportunity might expand\nthis to include a greater range of restrictions on freedom, beyond\nlegal restriction, formal exclusion, and overt coercion. For instance,\nit might be argued that enjoying a meaningful opportunity to compete\nfor a position depends on being in a position to know about the\nexistence of the competition. For this reason, it might be thought\nthat Equality of Opportunity for positions requires that they be\npublicized to a reasonable degree. It might also be argued that\nEquality of Opportunity is undercut by artificially constructed\ntechnical barriers to success deliberately designed to effectively\nexclude certain persons. A clear case of this would be the US during\nthe late nineteenth and twentieth century where literacy tests and\n\u201cgrandfather voting clauses\u201d\u2014whereby voting was\ndisallowed unless one\u2019s grandfather had voted\u2014were aimed\nat the de facto exclusion of \u201cblack\u201d Americans\nfrom exercising their formal voting rights.\n\nThese very thin ways of conceiving of Equality of Opportunity identify\nonly a limited range of factors which count as\nopportunity-undermining. Thus understood, Equality of Opportunity\nrules out caste hierarchy and manifest constraints on competing for or\nobtaining a good but fails to address a broad swathe of other factors\nwhich might plausibly be considered relevant for Equality of\nOpportunity. For this reason, as a political ideal of society or as a\ngenerally appropriate standard for competitive selection in areas like\nemployment and education, these thin conceptions are often considered\nto be inadequate ways of thinking about Equality of Opportunity.\n\nA still thicker conception of Equality of Opportunity, but still\nappropriately classified as Formal, also holds that factors such as\nnepotism and direct discrimination based on factors such as race, sex,\nand religion undermine Equality of Opportunity. Such a way of thinking\nabout Equality of Opportunity thereby identifies a further range of\nfactors that are impermissible determinants of different\npersons\u2019 prospects for success. A useful shorthand is to think\nabout this conception of Equality of Opportunity as including an\nanti-discrimination principle, under which certain factors, like race\nand sex, should not enhance or detract from a person\u2019s prospects\nof success in a competitive application. This matter is complicated by\na number of further considerations. First, some racialized or\nsex-based characteristics may, for some positions or roles, be\nconsidered appropriate criteria for selection\u2014such as selecting\nan actor to play the part of a member of a particular racialized\ngroup. Second, there is a difference between taking certain factors as\nthemselves a reason to select someone and using those factors as\nproxies for identifying other reasons for selection\u2014such as\ntaking honesty and conscientiousness as criteria for selection and\ndrawing on profiling data which suggests that women are generally more\nlikely to have such qualities in greater measure. Third, even when\napplicants are not directly discriminated against on the basis of\nfactors such as race and sex, other criteria for selection might\nindirectly discriminate against individuals with those\ncharacteristics\u2014such as criteria which downgrade applicants who\nmay need extended leave and the potential this has to indirectly\ndiscriminate against women during and after pregnancy.\n",
