    "main_text": "The order of knowledge || Psychology and logic\n7.2 Psychology and logic\n\nOne aspect of Wundt\u2019s hierarchy of method and knowledge deserves\nspecial attention, namely the place of logic in the sciences. Like\nalmost all the similarly titled tomes produced by the German\nmandarins, Wundt\u2019s Logik (in two, later three 600-page\nvolumes in four editions) molders away in research libraries. Its\ncontents are for the most part unrecognizable as \u201clogic\u201d\nin any contemporary sense. What most philosophers meant by\n\u201cLogik\u201d in Wundt\u2019s day was the rules and\nprocedure of inference governing the sciences, where this often\nincluded lengthy treatments of the actual scientific application of\nthese rules. What we would expect to find in a book called\n\u201cLogik\u201d today, viz., symbolic or mathematical\nlogic, was called at that time \u201cLogistik\u201d, and\nwas considered by some a mathematical (that is, merely formal) game\nunworthy of philosophy\u2019s scientific (that is,\nsubstantive) role (cf., e.g., Natorp 1910: 4\u201310). Thus we should\nnot be surprised to read Wundt, too, declare logic\u2019s task to be\nthe justifying and accounting for \u201cthose laws of thinking active\nin scientific knowledge\u201d (L I: 1).\n\nFor Wundt, however, this task involves psychology, and indeed much of\nhis Logik is devoted to this topic. As he reasonably points\nout, logic comprises the rules of correct thinking, and the principles\nof logic are known to us as conscious representations (L I:\n76; 13; cf. Wundt 1920: 267); thinking and consciousness are objects\nof psychological inquiry; therefore any account of logic must include\na psychological description of the genesis of logical principles\n(L I: 13). Even the normative character of logic had, in his\nview, to be given a psychological interpretation (cf. L I:\n76). Inevitably Wundt was accused of logical\npsychologism\u2014the all-purpose term of abuse flung about\nin fin-de-si\u00e8cle German philosophical debate. Husserl, for\nexample, condemned him for expounding an \u201cextreme\u201d form of\npsychologism (Husserl 1901: 124\u20135; cf. Farber 1943: 123, 208,\nff.; cf. Wundt 1910b: 511, ff.), viz.\n\u201cspecies-relativism\u201d, the notion that \u201ctruth varies\nwith different species\u201d of animal (Kusch 1995: 49). Yet Wundt\nhimself calls his Logik the \u201cmost rigorous rejection of\nthe psychologism that reigned at the time [i.e., 1880]\u201d (Wundt\n1920: 264), and held that \u201clogical thinking is universally\nbinding for every thinker\u201d (Wundt 1920: 266). How can we\nreconcile these statements?\n\nWundt\u2019s view of logic is unusual, but fully in line with his\nrigorously anti-metaphysical monistic perspectivism. That is, there is\nno logical \u201cthird realm\u201d, but merely a single process\ncalled \u201cthinking [Denken]\u201d (L I: 6); it\nis an immediately given fact of thinking that there are logical laws\nthat stand over against all our other thoughts and representations as\nnorms (L I: 76). Their psychological immediacy does not,\nWundt thinks, compromise their normativity, since what is given in\nconsciousness precisely is their normative\n character.[51]\n Once this character is taken for granted, the science of logic\ndevelops its systems of correct deductions (Schliessen)\nwithout further worry about the source of that normativity. All that\nremains is \u201cdevelop[ing] the foundations and methods of\nscientific knowledge\u201d (L I: 8).\n\nAccording to Wundt, the three features of logical thinking that set it\napart from all other types of representational connection are its\n\u201cspontaneity, evidence, and universal validity\n[Spontaneit\u00e4t, Evidenz, Allgemeing\u00fcltigkeit]\u201d\n(L I: 76). Let us briefly describe these. Wundt\u2019s\nnotion of the spontaneity of logical thinking is perhaps the most\npsychologistic-sounding of the three. Because, as was described above,\nthinking is\n\n\nexperienced immediately as an inner activity, \u2026 we must regard\nit as an act of will [Willenshandlung], and accordingly\nregard the logical laws of thought [Denkgesetze] as laws of\nthe will. (L I: 76\u20137)\n\n\nIn other words, logical thinking is accompanied essentially by a\nfeeling of the thinking subject\u2019s freedom in thinking. But while\nlogical thinking may be accompanied by an especially strong\nself-awareness of the mind\u2019s own activity, this feeling is not\nunique to logical thinking, since active apperception more generally\nis also accompanied by the sense of subjective activity. By contrast,\nlogical evidence and universal validity are characteristics possessed\nby logical thinking \u201cto a higher degree than by any other\npsychic function\u201d (L I: 78). By \u201cevidence\u201d,\nWundt means the character of compelling necessity accompanying a\nlogical judgment, what we might call self-evidence (L I: 78,\n79). A thought (Gedanke) may exhibit immediate certainty,\nobvious without any mediating thought-acts; or a thought may be\nmediately certain, grounded in prior thought-acts. Immediate and\nmediate evidence have their source and foundation in intuition\n(Anschauung): immediate evidence immediately, mediate\nevidence mediately (L I: 82\u20133). Intuition is not\nidentical with evidence, for evidence only\n\n\ncomes to be at the moment when logical thinking relates the contents\nof intuition and presupposes the relations of such intuitive contents\nas objectively given. (L I: 83)\n\n\nWundt thus charts a middle course between, on the one hand, making\nlogical evidence a \u201ctranscendent or transcendental\u201d\nfunction of thinking (as Kant and \u201crecent speculative\nphilosophy\u201d are alleged to do), and, on the other hand,\nconsidering it an \u201cempirical trait of sensible objects\u201d\n(as do empiricists and positivists) (L I: 83).\n\nBy the standards of such philosophers as Husserl, Natorp, and Frege,\nWundt appears committed to a logical psychologism. But it is worth\nconsidering his response to this charge, for it again illustrates his\nmonistic perspectivism. While he rejects any interpretation of the\norigin of logical principles that would impugn their normative\ncharacter of necessity, he also rejects the opposite extreme, what he\ncalls \u201cLogizismus\u201d\u2014the complete divorce of\nlogical thinking from thinking as it actually occurs in minds. For\nWundt, the logicist makes a metaphysical leap as suspect as it is\nunnecessary in conjuring up a \u201cpure\u201d,\n\u201cabsolute\u201d, \u201ctranscendental\u201d, but in any case\nseparate source of logical normativity (cf. Wundt 1910b:\n515). Instead of solving the puzzle of logical normativity, he\nexacerbates it by adding the puzzles of the ontological status of a\nthird realm, or of a transcendental ego, or of \u201cpure\nthinking\u201d, and the influence of all of these on your\nthinking as you read this. Wundt finds a simpler solution in his\nperspectivism. The logical may be considered \u201cpurely\u201d from\na logical point of view, i.e., in terms of its normative character,\nor \u201cgenetically\u201d from a psychological point of\nview. But there are no logical laws that are not also describable\npsychologically, just as there is no psychological phenomenon not also\ndescribable physiologically. But being \u201cdescribable\u201d in\nthis sense is not the same as being explicable, and it is\nthis separate task of explanation that falls to logic and psychology,\nrespectively. The logical description saves the phenomenon of\nnormativity, just as the psychological description saves the\nphenomenon of the interiority of consciousness.\n",
