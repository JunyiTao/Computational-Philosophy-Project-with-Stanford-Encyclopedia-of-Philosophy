    "preamble": "\nIndian thinkers distinguish between literal and non-literal meaning early in their history. They do so within different intellectual disciplines (\u015b\u0101stra-s), each broadly philosophical, but with varying emphases. Within the grammatical discipline, Y\u0101ska\u2019s Semantic Explanation (Nirukta), an early (perhaps 6th century to 3rd century BCE) etymological treatise recognizes the difference between ordinary (laukika) and metaphorical language (upam\u0101). This text, possibly pre-dating the renowned Sanskrit grammarian P\u0101\u1e47ini (ca 4th century BCE), employs etymological analysis in order to ascertain the meanings of unfamiliar terms used in the Vedas, a collection of texts including religious hymns, poetry, and rituals. In portions of the Vedas called Upani\u1e63ads, widely recognized as proto-philosophical, the limits of language are made explicit: ordinary speech cannot characterize ultimate reality, though figurative language can hint at it. These early texts focus on topics which would give rise to three intellectual disciplines: Grammar, Philosophy, and Aesthetics. (Capital letters distinguish the schools of thought from their subject matter.)\nTwo of the three disciplines, Grammar and Philosophy, are identifiable by their relationship to early \u201croot\u201d texts which form the basis of later commentarial reflection. Within Grammar, the aforementioned Y\u0101ska, as well as P\u0101\u1e47ini, Pata\u00f1jali (ca 2nd century BCE), and Bhart\u1e5bhari (ca 5th century CE), are a few of the most crucial thinkers whose reflections\u2014on the structure of Sanskrit in particular, and by way of Sanskrit, language in general\u2014informed philosophical reflection on meaning. For instance, P\u0101\u1e47ini\u2019s analysis of the morphology, syntax, and semantics of Sanskrit, in his Eight Chapters (A\u1e63\u1e6d\u0101dhy\u0101y\u012b) continues to be cited by philosophers a thousand years later. The literal/non-literal distinction is a topic as well for the various philosophical schools, each one known as a dar\u015bana, roughly a \u201cviewpoint.\u201d Both those who accept the Vedas as authoritative and those who do not address the distinction in the context of testimony and theories of reference. Among the former Vedic thinkers, this article primarily treats the Ny\u0101ya and M\u012bm\u0101\u1e43s\u0101 philosophical traditions, and of the Veda-denying, the Buddhists and the Jainas. Finally, the tradition here called Aesthetics (ala\u1e43k\u0101ra) is primarily focused on the aesthetics of poetry and drama\u2014especially the courtly poetry known as k\u0101vya. It encompasses topics studied in rhetoric, poetics, and aesthetics. Ala\u1e43k\u0101ra, despite meaning \u201cembellishment\u201d or \u201cornamentation,\u201d (in reference to figures of speech), studies the psychology of utterances, their ensuing emotional states in audiences, and their logical or semantic structures. Until the highly influential Light on Suggestion (Dhvany\u0101loka) of \u0100nandavardhana (ca 9th century CE), aesthetic theory was primarily, though not exclusively, focused on taxonomies of figuration, but after \u0100nandavardhana, it drew on philosophical work, in particular M\u012bm\u0101\u1e43s\u0101, to theorize about meaning itself.\nWhat follows focuses on the conceptual space for Indian theorizing about literal and non-literal meaning in each of these three textual traditions. Since the article\u2019s structure is topical rather than historical, a chronology of major figures is appended to help orient readers. The focus of the article is the period demarcated roughly from 200 CE to 1300 CE, often characterized as the Classical Period of Indian philosophy.\n",

    "main_text": "\n1. Conceptions of language in Indian philosophy\nBefore delving into the various disputes in Indian philosophy over what is commonly termed \u201cliteral meaning,\u201d let us first identify the cluster of concepts and corresponding terms Indian philosophers use in their analysis of meaning. The Sanskrit term for \u201cmeaning,\u201d artha, has a semantic range that includes also \u201cobject,\u201d \u201cwealth,\u201d and \u201cgoal.\u201d It can be used both for external referents of words as well as meanings \u201cin the head,\u201d although the term for occurrent mental states is frequently j\u00f1\u0101na, usually translated as \u201ccognition\u201d or \u201cawareness.\u201d Both words and sentences are said to have meanings, although in what manner they have them, and how word- and sentence-meanings interrelate are subjects of debate.\n1.1 Identifying Linguistic Capacities\nWhether in the form of words or sentences, language has capacities\u2014it can refer to things, cause mental cognitions, impel action, prompt emotional states, and so on. That such an ability exists is accepted by everyone, although thinkers enumerate the linguistic capacities differently, and also identify different results for them. In terms of outcomes, the meaning which results from the most fundamental linguistic capacity of the word is said to be \u201cprincipal\u201d (mukhya) or \u201cdenoted\u201d (abhidh\u0101). This meaning is sometimes defined in terms of its being understood immediately after speech, by hearers. (The extent to which the phenomenology of language comprehension guides distinctions about meaning is addressed further below.) For some philosophers, from the cognition that this meaning causes, another linguistic capacity can subsequently operate, given certain conditions, to generate a new, \u201csecondary\u201d meaning. This further meaning is sometimes carved into two varieties: indication (lak\u1e63a\u1e47\u0101) and qualitative expression (gau\u1e47av\u1e5btti), something like metonymy and metaphor respectively, although this is to generalize over distinctions important especially in Aesthetics. Two other capacities are sometimes adduced: purport (t\u0101tparya) and suggestion (dhvani), which we will examine more closely below. Initially, let us characterize the first as something like speaker\u2019s intention and the second as encompassing phenomena such as connotations and implicatures which the other capacities putatively cannot explain. In English scholarship, the first two of these four capacities are referred to as \u201cprimary\u201d and \u201csecondary,\u201d and this article will follow this convention.\nWhatever the number of capacities, they can be characterized functionally; in fact, the term function (vy\u0101p\u0101ra) or operation (v\u1e5btti) is often used in place of the word for capacity more generally. In attempts to enumerate the capacities, philosophers consider questions such as what the basis of a linguistic function might be, and whether they are one-to-one or one-to-many functions (Ganeri 2006). Discussion of linguistic functions is important for understanding epistemology, a topic of interest primarily to Philosophy in contrast to Grammar and Aesthetics (see the entry on epistemology in classical Indian philosophy). These thinkers focus on how testimonial uses of language are authoritative ways of knowing (pram\u0101\u1e47a), whether in ordinary discourse or religious discourse such as the Vedas or the Buddha\u2019s speech. For one example, consider Ny\u0101ya (\u201cReasoning\u201d). In the Ny\u0101ya root text, Ny\u0101yas\u016btra (NS), attributed to Ak\u1e63ap\u0101da Gautama (ca 200 CE), speech is defined as the assertion of an authoritative person (NS 1.1.7). Since the cognitions resulting from testimony are an important basis for acting, Ny\u0101ya philosophers are concerned with what hearers understand from speech, in particular, from nouns (NS 2.2.56). It is in this context that they take up the relationship between primary and secondary meaning, and the basis for figurative language use. Specifically, they are concerned with whether the principal referent of a noun is\u2014a generic property, a particular thing, or some combination (their preferred view).\nAesthetic thinkers, especially beginning with \u0100nandavardhana (ca 9th century CE), focus on distinctions between the capacities of language. \u0100nandavardhana himself is primarily concerned to defend the existence of a new linguistic capacity, suggestion (on which see section 3 below). With illustrations drawn from poetry, drama, and the epic Mah\u0101bh\u0101rata, he argues that phonemes, words, sentences, and entire discourse units can suggest subtle meanings, associated with an aestheticized emotion or \u201cflavor\u201d (rasa). It is up to later philosophers of aesthetics to explain the status of suggestion with regard to the ordinary categories of linguistic capacities. Some, like Mukula Bha\u1e6d\u1e6da (ca 9th to 10th century CE) give a reductionist account on which it is equivalent to indication, whereas others, like Bha\u1e6d\u1e6da N\u0101yaka (ca 900 CE) deny that it is a linguistic capacity at all, but argue, rather, that it is psychological. Aesthetic arguments for and against the various linguistic capacities draw on Ny\u0101ya as well as M\u012bm\u0101\u1e43s\u0101 philosophical texts.\n1.2 Appeals to Phenomenology\nDefinitions of meaning often appeal to phenomenology, the way in which a cognition seems to arise from hearing a word or sentence. This focus on the psychology of language use is found in all three disciplines. For example, the M\u012bm\u0101\u1e43s\u0101 (\u201cHermeneutics\u201d) philosopher Kum\u0101rila Bha\u1e6d\u1e6da (ca 7th century CE, see entry on Kum\u0101rila) writes in his Exposition on Ritual Practice (Tantrav\u0101rttika, hereafter TV) that, like a face, the primary meaning is perceived first, before anything else, such as secondary meaning (TV 3.2.1). (The Sanskrit word for a face is mukha, etymologically related to mukhya, the term for primary meaning.) The Grammarian Bhart\u1e5bhari argues in his Treatise on Sentences and Words (V\u0101kyapad\u012bya) that division of sentences into words and phonemes is artificial. This is in part based his observation that hearers experience meaning as a unified whole. He claims that what conveys meaning is a spho\u1e6da, or \u201cburst,\u201d which is partless and different from the sequence of sounds composing a sentence (see section 4.3 and Matilal (1990: 84ff) for discussion about how precisely to characterize spho\u1e6da in relationship to meaning.)\nAesthetic theorists focus on the psychology of the poet and the hearer, in part to understand the relationship between ordinary language and poetic language, but also to distinguish among the varieties of poetic utterances. Among the psychological principles widely accepted by Indian thinkers is that ordinary conventional meanings are stronger than analytically-determined ones (Raja 1969). So the term pa\u1e45ka-ja has constituent parts which together mean \u201cmud-born\u201d but conventionally it refers to the lotus, and the latter meaning would come to a hearer\u2019s mind first. Aesthetic philosopher Mukula Bha\u1e6d\u1e6da argues in his Fundamentals of the Communicative Function (Abhidh\u0101v\u1e5bttam\u0101t\u1e5bk\u0101) that some words become so conventionalized that their status as secondary meaning is unavailable to the speaker, who takes herself to be speaking literally (McCrea 2008, Keating 2019).\nHowever, there is a limit to the role that reflection on psychology plays in the analysis of meaning. For early M\u012bm\u0101\u1e43s\u0101 philosophers, only Sanskrit terms have genuine expressive capacities.This conclusion is not due to an investigation of the psychology of non-Sanskrit speakers, but the principle of parsimony. It is explanatorily better to posit a fundamental language, where word and meaning are fixed in one-to-one correspondence, which has been corrupted by mispronunciation over time (see TV 1.3.24ff). So, hearing a foreign word like gavi, people understand its meaning, \u201ccow,\u201d through its similarity with the correct Sanskrit word (gau\u1e25), whether or not they are aware of the process. This view is challenged by other philosophers, such as Dharmak\u012brti in his V\u0101dany\u0101ya (Norms of Debate).\n1.3 Role of Sanskrit Language\nReflection on language in Indian philosophy, for the Brahminical, Veda-accepting traditions at least, begins and ends with the Sanskrit language, in what has been termed \u201cthe Sanskrit cosmopolis\u201d (Pollock 2006). It is not merely that Sanskrit is the vehicle for reflection on language, but the Sanskrit language itself is a target of inquiry. Pata\u00f1jali explains the reasons for this in his Great Commentary (Mah\u0101bh\u0101\u1e63ya), a commentary on K\u0101ty\u0101yana\u2019s 3rd century BCE commentary on P\u0101\u1e47ini\u2019s Eight Chapters. These reasons are largely centered on the preservation and correct performance of Vedic rituals. Along with these pragmatic aims, there comes the belief in a special metaphysical and epistemic status for Sanskrit\u2014it has natural (autpattika, intrinsic) connections to its referents, which other languages lack; thus, at least in the context of the Vedas, it can give us infallible knowledge about the world, without the corruption of fallible human intermediaries. This conception is not shared by all orthoprax thinkers, however, as Ny\u0101ya philosophers argue for the conventionality of language (NS 2.1.55).\nTraditions which reject Vedic authority also reject the primacy of Sanskrit, largely preferring to write in P\u0101li and Prakrit. At a certain point, however, and for unknown reasons, Buddhist thinkers such as N\u0101g\u0101rjuna begin to write in Sanskrit (Kelly 1996). Regardless of which language they employ, Buddhists reject the notion of an inherent connection between the Sanskrit language and reality\u2014indeed, they argue that no language has such a connection\u2014arguing as early on as the famous The Questions of King Milinda (Milindapa\u00f1h\u0101) that language is conventional. Still, the fact that Naiy\u0101yikas and Buddhists agree on the conventional nature of language shows that the religious prominence of Sanskrit does not necessarily entail specific philosophical commitments about its referential capacities. However, those who take on the assumption of an innate connection between Sanskrit word and referent then had explanatory burdens, such as how to explain linguistic innovation within Sanskrit and the referential capacities of non-Sanskrit languages.\n2. Primary and Secondary Meaning\nOne of the most central distinctions in Indian philosophy of language is that between primary and secondary meaning. While this could be characterized as the distinction between \u201cliteral\u201d and \u201cnon-literal\u201d meaning, for some philosophers, word meanings that seem intuitively literal are classified as being secondary. For instance, the word \u201ccow\u201d in the sentence \u201cA cow is to be led out to pasture\u201d would, according to M\u012bm\u0101\u1e43s\u0101 philosophers following Kum\u0101rila, be taken as an instance of secondary meaning, for reasons discussed below. Further, since the literal/non-literal distinction in Western philosophy of language is vexed (see the distinction \u201cliteral/non-literal\u201d in the entry on pragmatics), this entry henceforth avoids such terminology.\n2.1 Lexical Meaning\nMost classical Indian thinkers (some Buddhists being an important exception, see section 4.1) understand word meaning, or pad\u0101rtha, to refer to objects in the world, and to do so directly. For these thinkers\u2014Ny\u0101ya and Vai\u015be\u1e63ika, M\u012bm\u0101\u1e43s\u0101\u2014the referential function is primary. However, despite broad agreement about the basic referential function of words, they disagree about what its objects are. One such dispute, which has implications for the primary/secondary distinction, is over the relationship between words and universals. Kum\u0101rila argues that the primary referent of words is a universal. Kum\u0101rila\u2019s reasoning is that, without words denoting the universal property belonging to, for example, all cows, there would not be a permanent (nitya) relationship between word and referent. For if \u201ccow\u201d means a specific cow, Bessie, when Bessie goes out of existence, the word lacks denotation (\u015aV). Further, the Vedic injunction, \u201cA cow is to be tied up,\u201d can be followed in numerous rituals\u2014but if a specific cow were intended, it could be followed only once. (This argument is found in early Grammatical thought as well, see below.) Still, despite the fact that all M\u012bm\u0101\u1e43sakas accept the requirement of fixity of word and referent, they do not all accept the universal-denotation view. Some agree with another philosopher, roughly contemporaneous with Kum\u0101rila, Prabh\u0101kara (his followers are known as \u201cPr\u0101bh\u0101karas,\u201d with the first long \u201c\u0101\u201d equivalent to the English \u201c-an\u201d as in \u201cFregean\u201d). They reject the universal-denotation view in connection with their view of sentence meaning (see sections 4.3 and 5.1).\nIn contrast, in the NS and its commentaries, Ny\u0101ya philosophers argue that words refer to universals, forms, and individual things. They point out that universals are never instantiated without particular things, and so the universal alone cannot be the referent. But likewise, since universals are identified by form (a cow is recognized as having cowhood by its particular structure), we must also take it into account. Replying to M\u012bm\u0101\u1e43s\u0101 philosophers who defend and refine the universals-denotation view, along with other opponents who defend individual- and form-only views, Ny\u0101ya philosophers defend and refine the context-dependent view. V\u0101tsy\u0101yana, for example, in the Commentary on Ny\u0101ya (Ny\u0101yabh\u0101\u1e63ya, hereafter NBh), argues for an epistemic point, that \u201cIt is not known which among these is the object or meaning of the word, or whether all of them might be meant\u201d (NBh 2.2.59; Dasti and Phillips 2017). He takes on arguments from interlocutors who argue that only the individual or the universal is meant by words. V\u0101tsy\u0101yana observes that, to take the example of \u201ccow\u201d again, one never encounters a bare particular (individual). Rather, the individual cow is always found to be qualified by the universal. Ceteris paribus for universals, which do not exist apart from individuals. So it is possible that both universal and particular are meant together, along with form or shape (\u0101kr\u0323ti), though in a structured relationship where one is predominant and the others are subsidiary, the particular structure depending on context. See Dasti 2020 for a summary of early Ny\u0101ya arguments.\nGrammarians also consider the question of word reference. P\u0101\u1e47ini takes at least a partial position on the question, claiming that if words only refer to particulars, then someone who ties up one cow for a sacrifice, in response to a Vedic command, would be in error if they, in a later ritual, tie up another cow, as the command could only refer to a single specific animal (Eight Chapters 1.2.64). After him, Pata\u00f1jali, in the Great Commentary, refers to two earlier grammarians (whose work is not independently available), Vy\u0101\u1e0di and V\u0101japy\u0101yana, who differ on this topic. Vy\u0101\u1e0di argues that words primarily refer to particulars and V\u0101japy\u0101yana claims they refer to universals. Pata\u00f1jali splits the difference, claiming that both aspects are part of word-meaning, but which one is primary may vary (see Deshpande 2003; VM; and Matilal 1971.) Matilal illustrates the moves in the debate with the example of a compound, \u201ca brave-man\u201d (Sanskrit: v\u012bra-puru\u1e63a\u1e25). V\u0101japy\u0101yana would argue that if \u201cbrave\u201d refers to the attribute of braveness, and \u201cman\u201d to the attribute of manhood, then these two referents can be related together in an underlying, unifying substratum (sam\u0101n\u0101dhikara\u1e47a). But if his opponent, Vy\u0101\u1e0di, were correct, there would be no way to make sense of the compound, since both terms would refer to the same individual, and thus there would be repetition. However, by making use of the distinction between expressed meaning and the implied ground for the meaning, Vy\u0101\u1e0di could reply: yes, \u201cbrave\u201d strictly refers to a brave man, but this word is used because of the man\u2019s braveness, whereas the other word is used because of the man\u2019s being a man.\nWhether the primary word-function results in a particular or universal, philosophers understand its resultant cognition as a basis for unhesitating action. Word meaning is treated in the context of epistemology and the topic of verbal testimony. The two sets of philosophers above, M\u012bm\u0101\u1e43sakas and Naiy\u0101yikas, both agree that verbal testimony is a way of knowing. However, for Ny\u0101ya philosophers, testimony is authoritative because of the speaker\u2019s characteristics while M\u012bm\u0101\u1e43sakas emphasize the innately authoritative nature of statements, regardless of speaker, at at least when it comes to Vedic sentences. While they believe that sentences (v\u0101kya) are truth-bearers, and not individual words, since sentences are composed of words, Ny\u0101ya and M\u012bm\u0101\u1e43s\u0101 philosophers focus on the invariable contributions of words to sentences\u2014their primary meanings. This emphasis, we will see, is not shared by everyone, as the grammarian Bhart\u1e5bhari rejects any ultimate metaphysical distinction between words and sentences, arguing that such divisions are provisional and arbitrary, even if useful in some contexts.\n2.2 Varieties of Secondary Meaning\nIn what follows, we will classify any kind of derivative meaning, whether it be metaphor, metonymy, irony, hyperbole, punning, etc., as \u201csecondary.\u201d Again, we are in the realm of word-meanings, although there is discussion of sentence-level secondary meaning, primarily in M\u012bm\u0101\u1e43s\u0101, Ved\u0101nta, and Ala\u1e41k\u0101ra. While the task of precisely carving up varieties of secondary meaning was frequently left to philosophers working on aesthetics, other philosophers also took an interest in this question. Many stock examples of secondary meaning are shared among the textual traditions, although it is not until much later, in the seventeenth century, that Indian linguistic analysis becomes robustly interdisciplinary, in the work of Navya-Ny\u0101ya (see Bronner 2002). There are various ways to classify secondary meaning: it may be based on the logical relationship between primary and secondary meaning, on the semantic distance between them, or on the role of speaker intention.\nFor instance, Mukula Bha\u1e6d\u1e6da, the aforementioned philosopher of aesthetics, distinguishes between secondary meaning that is qualitative and secondary meaning that is free from qualities. The qualitative includes metaphorical cases such as \u201cThe person is an ox,\u201d where the stubbornness of the person and the ox are understood to be shared qualities. In contrast, cases like \u201cThe village is on the Ganges\u201d are typical of those that are free from qualities. Here, the word \u201cbank\u201d is understood so as to avoid the interpretation that the village is floating on the river itself\u2014but there are no properties shared between the village and the Ganges (or the bank). In point of fact, Mukula argues that a speaker may intend different secondary meanings with the same utterance type, since another reason someone might utter the sentence is to communicate that the village and the Ganges do share qualities\u2014the holiness of the Ganges river could be attributed to the village due to proximity. In this way, the Ganges sentence could exemplify a different utterance, one where there is \u201csemantic imbuing\u201d of the qualities of the river to the bank (Keating 2019:55, 117\u2013126). Thus whether a speaker intends or does not intend a secondary meaning becomes relevant to its characterization. Finally, both the qualitative and quality-free varieties may differ in terms of how closely related the primary and secondary meanings are. Mukula describes highly conventional language use as cases of \u201cabsorption\u201d\u2014for instance, using the term \u201cruler\u201d for to someone who is not from the ruling class (so not strictly a ruler), but who performs the functions a ruler does (such as protecting of people). In contrast, metaphors such as \u201cThe person is an ox\u201d are not absorption, but superimposition, since some difference is understood. (See Keating 2019, Cuneo 2020, and McCrea 2008 for further discussion of Mukula and \u0100nandavardhana on these topics.)\nAll of these varieties of secondary meaning require three conditions. First, there must be an obstacle in the primary meaning of the words. Second, there must some relationship\u2014of which kind, more below\u2014between the primary and secondary meaning. Third, there must be a warrant for the secondary meaning, such as a motivation on the speaker\u2019s part or some accepted conventional sense. To take a stock example, \u201cFeed the sticks,\u201d which means \u201cFeed the brahmins holding the sticks,\u201d word \u201csticks\u201d refers to something which is inanimate and which cannot be fed. Thus, the first condition is met\u2014an obstacle to what is called \u201csemantic fit\u201d (yogyat\u0101) which is necessary for a unified sentence. Second, there is a relationship of association between br\u0101hmin priests and sticks\u2014they carry walking sticks. Association is not the only possible relationship between primary and secondary meaning, but it is one, and it fulfills the second condition. Finally, a speaker using this phrase would be trading on a conventionalized use, and thus meets the third condition, of warrant.\nWhile this three-fold set of conditions is commonly accepted, given different analyses of primary word-meaning, the boundary between primary and secondary meaning will be drawn differently. For instance, Bh\u0101\u1e6d\u1e6da M\u012bm\u0101\u1e43sakas, who take the primary word-meaning to be a universal, find cases of secondary meaning more pervasive than Ny\u0101ya philosophers, for whom word-meaning in the primary sense is more flexible. Given the command, \u201cA cow is to be tied up,\u201d the correct thing to do is to find some single cow to fasten to a post. However, M\u012bm\u0101\u1e43sakas such as Kum\u0101rila argue that the primary meaning of \u201ccow\u201d in the command is cowhood, which cannot be fastened to a post. Thus there is an obstacle to the semantic fit of the sentence. To resolve this difficulty, Kum\u0101rila invokes the secondary meaning function known as indication (lak\u1e63a\u1e47\u0101), on which see McCrea 2020. In TV 1.3.10, he argues that indication causes hearers to understand that an individual cow is meant. Hearers understand this from the knowledge that \u201ccow\u201d means cowhood, that individual cows are qualified by cowhood, and yet that the sentence is uttered for the purpose of fulfilling sacrificial aims. Thus the relationship between the primary and secondary meanings here is inherence (a universal inheres in an individual), and the speaker aims to pick out a particular cow.\nOne of the central categories of secondary meaning is those meanings which have similarities with the primary meaning. For instance, Kum\u0101rila takes qualitative expression (gau\u1e47av\u1e5btti), figures based on similarities, to be one of the two major types of secondary meaning, where indication (lak\u1e63a\u1e47\u0101) is a catch-all category for figures based on any other kind of relationship. The figure of speech which rhetorical traditions tracing back to ancient Greece call \u201cmetaphor\u201d would fall under qualitative expression, although Indian thinkers generally focus on the logical structure underlying figures rather than a syntactic structure by which metaphor is often characterized (Gerow 1971). Kum\u0101rila discusses the common example \u201cDevadatta is a lion,\u201d saying that when people hear the utterance, they find the word \u201clion\u201d to be inexplicable as referring to Devadatta, and therefore conclude that the term must be used figuratively. However, while some thinkers would describe metaphors as involving a superimposition of lion on Devadatta, Kum\u0101rila explicitly rejects this analysis, saying that all that is meant is that there are similar properties that the two have, such as bravery. Otherwise, superimposition would mean there is confusion about the genuine difference between people and lions.\nOne might object that the three examples just given: \u201cFeed the sticks,\u201d \u201cA cow is to be tied up,\u201d and \u201cDevadatta is a lion\u201d do not all have the same kind of obstacle. Philosophers, in the Aesthetic discipline and elsewhere, work to make the nature of this obstacle precise. While initially the emphasis is on the semantic connection within the sentence itself, for Ny\u0101ya and M\u012bm\u0101\u1e43s\u0101 both, by the time of Ma\u1e47\u1e0dana Mi\u015bra (ca seventh century CE) and V\u0101caspati Mi\u015bra (ca tenth century CE), the failure is taken to be wider, including problems with the larger context. In the ninth century work of Mukula Bha\u1e6d\u1e6da, such a widening is apparent as he distinguishes between multiple features of context which may require a word to be taken in a secondary sense: a speaker, sentence, time, place, and circumstance. Sometimes there is a clash between a speaker and a sentence meaning, as in the case taken from courtly love poetry\u2014a common source of linguistic examples\u2014where a young woman utters words, \u201cI go alone to the forest along the riverbank\u201d to a neighbor. She is to be understood as conveying the opposite (she is not going alone) to her neighbor, but intending her husband to overhear and to believe she is telling the truth. Since we know facts (through the poetic context or genre) about the woman\u2019s personal life, Mukula argues that the sentence cannot be taken to mean the literal truth.\n2.3 Bitextuality and Polysemy\nAn important phenomenon in Indian poetry, double meaning (\u015ble\u1e63a), garnered the attention of philosophers of aesthetics and, to a lesser extent, philosophers and grammarians. At its most basic level, the figure involves using a single word in two or more different senses. It is akin to \u201cpunning\u201d but without the connotation of triviality that often accompanies puns, hence the term \u201cbitextuality\u201d (Bronner 2010). In fact, according to Rudra\u1e6da, in his Ornaments of Poetry (K\u0101vy\u0101la\u1e45k\u0101ra, ca 855 CE), bitextuality is the perfect figure of speech (Gerow 1977). The phenomenon in Sanskrit was not limited to a word or two, here and there, but entire compositions were written which admit of two different meanings. One of the most prominent examples is of poems which, read one way tell the story of the R\u0101m\u0101ya\u1e47a, and read another way, narrate the Mah\u0101bh\u0101rata. Examples are difficult to translate into English, since they rely on particularities of Sanskrit: word breaks which are frequently joined together, the ubiquity of compounds, and the fact of phonemic transformation at phonetic boundaries (sa\u1e43dhi) which can be reconstructed in multiple ways. For instance, d\u0101syas\u012btyuktv\u0101 can be disambiguated as d\u0101sy as\u012bty uktv\u0101 (saying, \u201cyou are my slave\u201d) or d\u0101syas\u012bty uktv\u0101 (saying [to myself] \u201cyou will give!\u201d) (Bronner 2010: xvii).\nThis particular linguistic device is not merely a figurative ornament, but is at the center of a major intellectual and literary movement. Poetic lexicons exist which contain stipulated meanings for syllables. These assist poets in creating bitextual compositions. Poetic commentaries tease out the multiplicities inherent in poems, whether or not they are intended by the author. Bronner (2010) identifies several ways in which the existence of bitextuality was a sticking point for theorists trying to give an account of word-meaning and the relationship between meaning and aesthetics. First, there is the difficulty of identifying a particular logical structure underpinning bitextuality. Second, there is the question of whether bitextuality\u2019s effects are due to word-meaning or to the sounds of words. Finally, there is the problem of the psychology of bitextuality.\nOne reason that bitextuality resists explanation is that the multiple \u201cregisters\u201d (ways of reading the text), such as the story of the R\u0101m\u0101ya\u1e47a and the Mah\u0101bh\u0101rata mentioned above, are not merely two distinct sets of unrelated meanings. Rather, similes or metaphors frequently connect the readings. For instance, Dhana\u00f1jaya\u2019s \u201cPoem of Two Targets,\u201d through setting the R\u0101m\u0101ya\u1e47a and the Mah\u0101bh\u0101rata \u201cside-by-side\u201d allows the reader to contrast the protagonists of the two epics (Bronner 2010: 110). Further, even where such relationships are not obvious, given the important principle that non-literal utterances must be supported by some warrant, whether conventional or due to speaker aims, most Sanskrit thinkers argued that no one would utter a sentence with two meanings that are unrelated. Mahima Bha\u1e6d\u1e6da (11th century CE), in his Analysis of \u201cManifestation\u201d (Vyaktiviveka), argues that paranomasia, as a kind of meaning, must be coherent in the sense of having semantic fit, even if, as a kind of secondary meaning, there are cues which lead the reader to go beyond the strictly literal sense. However, unlike cases of metaphor, where there is an obstacle to semantic fit, as in \u201cDevadatta is a lion,\u201d bitextuality requires that there be (at least) two sets of coherent meanings which have semantic fit and also that there be a way to bring both meanings together. Further, since the trigger for bitextuality cannot be a failure of semantic fit, there must be some cue other than just the mere possibility of reading a sentence in two ways (McCrea 2008). \u0100nandavardhana, however, who comes two centuries before Mahima Bha\u1e6d\u1e6da, argues that there may be bitextual poems in which two sets of meanings do not cause a further metaphor or simile (Bronner 2010: 204; McCrea 2008: 434).\n3. Suggested Meaning and Speaker\u2019s Intention\n\u0100nandavardhana argues for a new linguistic capacity, suggestion (dhvani or vya\u00f1jan\u0101), which he believes accounts for important phenomena not included within existing theories of secondary meaning. His commentator, Abhinavagupta, elaborates on this theory, though in a way which goes beyond \u0100nandavardhana\u2019s original text, and he also writes his own independent treatise on the topic. As a result of these two thinkers (authoring the Light on Suggestion and The Eye, respectively), a new debate opens. It centers on whether existing theories of language can account for the subtleties of meaning found in literature, such as courtly poetry, drama, and great epics. Those who agree that suggestion must be accepted discuss what kinds of suggested meaning ought to be adduced; those who reject suggestion generally try to show that for each putative category of suggested meaning, an equivalent explanation can be given, through already-accepted processes such as indication or inferential reasoning. This discussion is not much taken up in philosophical circles in the Classical period. For instance, the Ny\u0101ya philosopher Jayanta Bha\u1e6d\u1e6da (ca ninth century CE) has a stray remark disparaging suggestion in his Flower Garland of Logic (Ny\u0101yama\u00f1jar\u012b), but he does not engage substantively with arguments against it.\n3.1 Insufficiency of Existing Capacities\n\u0100nandavardhana proceeds by citing passages which are generally accepted to have various kinds of poetic effects, and then analyzing how these effects are attained by suggestion. He divides the content of what is suggested into implied meanings, implied figures, and aesthetic moods (rasa). He also distinguishes among varieties of suggested meaning according to other criteria such as the speaker\u2019s intention, how rapidly the hearer recovers the suggested content, and whether expressions or phonemes are the basis for what is suggested. When suggestion is a way of conveying the rasa, the dominant aesthetic mood described or intimated within a poem, it is called rasa-dhvani. \u0100nandavardhana tries to give an account of when it is that suggestion causes poetic beauty, and argues that rasa is the proper aim of all poetry. It is important to mark that, for \u0100nandavardhana, rasa is found within the text, and not the reader. The reader simply comes to have a cognition of the text\u2019s rasa. Thus it is easily understood as meaning, and not a reader\u2019s emotional state. After Abhinavagupta\u2019s commentary on \u0100nandavardhana, the emphasis shifts onto the reader\u2019s emotive experience, and how to understand rasa in relation to other kinds of meaning becomes more difficult. Even though many things may be suggested (figures of speech, facts), the ultimate aim of dhvani or suggestion in the poetic context is to suggest rasa.\nTake the case of \u201cThe village is on the Ganges.\u201d Here, \u0100nandavardhana argues that suggestion operates after both primary and secondary meaning. What is suggested is the purity of the village which is on the bank of the holy Ganges river. Note, though, that he does not think that both primary and secondary meaning are always necessary for suggestion. For instance, the word \u201cGanges\u201d itself could suggest purity without being in a metaphorical or otherwise figurative context (here, it is metonymical for the bank). \u0100nandavardhana also contrasts the function of suggestion with the primary meaning function. As for the latter, he says the relationship between the composition of words in a sentence and its primary meaning is a \u201cnatural relation.\u201d The sense in which the word\u2013referent relation is \u201cnatural\u201d is that it is fixed. A word\u2019s primary meaning is that meaning which is cognized in every single instance the word is employed. Suggestion, in contrast, is an \u201cartificial relation\u201d since it is a meaning that is not given by its natural word, and the relationship between suggested meaning and a suggestive word is not one\u2013to\u2013one.\nOn \u0100nandavardhana\u2019s view, the suggested meaning is a further step beyond the secondary meaning, but is not always understood through what is secondarily meant. For example, what is suggested in this case is understood through the primary meaning of \u201cGanges,\u201d since it is the river and not the bank which is associated with suggested properties (specified as its purity and coolness, according to later thinkers). The crucial aspect of \u0100nandavardhana\u2019s view is that while secondary meaning requires a failure of semantic fit, suggestion does not. A hearer\u2019s understanding of \u201con the Ganges\u201d as meaning \u201con the bank of the Ganges\u201d is necessary in order for the sentence not to cause a cognition of a village as floating upon the Ganges. In contrast, the suggested sense does not rectify any apparent semantic incompatibility in the literal meaning of the sentence.\n3.2 Varieties of Suggested Meaning\nWhile one can present a definitive number of types of suggestion (Abhinavagupta says there are thirty-five), \u0100nandavardhana himself says there are an endless number of combinations if we take into account all of the facts involved in creating suggested meaning. Whether this should be taken literally or as a rhetorical flourish, the point is that \u0100nandavardhana does not view his analysis as a complete taxonomy of suggested meaning. In keeping with this spirit, only a few of the important divisions are discussed below.\n\u0100nandavardhana subdivides suggestion in two ways based on two kinds of intentions a speaker has with regard to the expression she utters. This is consistent with his view that underlying all cases of suggestion there is a purpose (prayojana) the speaker has in choosing a particular expression. In particular, these intentions are defined in terms of the speaker\u2019s attitude towards the primary meaning of an expression. First, a speaker may intend to convey the primary meaning plus some suggested meaning. Second, she may not intend to convey the primary meaning, but only have an intention to convey a suggested meaning.\nAs an example of the first type, \u0100nandavardhana cites love poetry written by the Buddhist philosopher Dharmak\u012brti (ca 6th to 7th century CE, see the entry on Dharmak\u012brti). The poem describes images of birds and fruit which are meant to be taken literally. However, these images are juxtaposed in a way which suggests an additional sense consistent with the romantic tone of the poem. There is no explicit comparison between the images, but the comparison is suggested. This kind of suggestion is something like the phenomenon in Ezra Pound\u2019s famous imagist poem, \u201cIn a Station of a Metro\u201d\n\nThe apparition of these faces in the crowd;\nPetals on a wet, black bough. (Pound 1913)\n\nThere is no linguistic metaphor in the sense of an explicit predication between two things, such as faces and petals. However, the reader understands an implicit comparisons between the two images. Thus there is both primary and suggested meaning. Other times, \u0100nandavardhana says, the speaker intends only to convey a suggested meaning, so the primary meaning may be entirely replaced or set aside in some manner. For example, in this passage from the R\u0101m\u0101ya\u1e47a, the phrase \u201cblinded\u201d is not being used in a primary sense, but in a suggestive manner:\n\nThe sun has stolen our affection for the moon,\nwhose circle is now dull with frost\nand like a mirror blinded by breath,\nshines no more. (DL: 209)\n\nSince a mirror cannot, strictly speaking, be made blind\u2014breath merely fogs it\u2014this is a case where the speaker intends what is suggested to replace the primary meaning.\nWhile the previous categories are distinguished by the speaker\u2019s aims, the two other categories are distinguished by the hearer\u2019s experience. \u0100nandavardhana says that when hearers come to understand the suggested meaning of a poem, they can do so either instantaneously or else after a \u201creverberation\u201d\u2014some experienced temporal gap between recovering the literal meaning and recovering the suggested meaning. The suggested content characterized by reverberation may be similar to what contemporary philosophers talk about in terms of the metaphorical \u201cfelt gap\u201d between literal and metaphorical meanings in particular (e.g., Camp & Reimer 2008). However, it also includes the idea of a temporal gap between understanding the literal and suggested meaning. The phenomenological observation can, and should, be distinguished from a claim about content recovery. \u0100nandavardhana does not appeal to the phenomenology of suggested meanings as evidence that they are recovered in a certain way, though such a move was certainly available to him, as we have seen in section 1.2.\n\u0100nandavardhana categorizes a case of bitextuality (\u015ble\u1e63a) as involving reverberation, as both meanings do not occur to the reader simultaneously. Further he describes this as a case where the sentence (rather than individual words) suggests a second meaning, which comes like a \u201creverberation\u201d or some time after the first. This supports the idea that reverberation is about processing time, rather than (or in addition to) a felt tension. Elsewhere, \u0100nandavardhana points out that for many kinds of suggestion, hearers do not have a \u201creverberation\u201d or awareness of a gap between the primary meaning and what is suggested. Abhinavagupta gives an analogy to explain cases where there is no such reverberation. He says that when someone has taken to heart the relationship between smoke and fire, she will be able to reason inferentially to the existence of fire simply on the perceptual basis of smoke. There need not be any awareness of inferential processes on the part of the thinker.\n\u0100nandavardhana distinguishes in a number of other ways between varieties of suggestion. He identifies the basis of suggestion: word meanings, sentence meanings, discourse unit meanings, and even the sounds of individual phonemes can all give rise to suggested meaning. A poem\u2019s entire \u201cmeaning,\u201d that is, a comparison which may not be explicit in the poem, but is suggested throughout, can itself be the basis for a suggested rasa, such as love or heroism. At a more local level, individual phonemes within a poem may also suggest an aesthetic mood, through being sonorous or harsh, etc. These distinctions within suggested meaning underscore the need for caution in drawing equivalence between suggestion and analytic philosophical concepts, such as implicature (see the entry on implicature) which is roughly analogous to, but not co-extensive with, \u0100nandavardhana\u2019s dhvani, since \u0100nandavardhana denies that suggestion arises through inferential reasoning.\n3.3 Objections to Suggested Meaning\nAlthough \u0100nandavardhana\u2019s theory of suggested meaning was influential for many philosophers of aesthetics in the years following his Light on Suggestion, not everyone accepted the new model. There were two ways of rejecting suggestion: reducing it to a non-linguistic capacity or reducing it to an already-existing linguistic capacity\u2014primary or secondary meaning. The first strategy is followed, in different ways, by Bha\u1e6d\u1e6da N\u0101yaka and Mahima Bha\u1e6d\u1e6da, whereas the second is followed by Mukula Bha\u1e6d\u1e6da and members of the Pr\u0101bh\u0101kara school of M\u012bm\u0101\u1e43s\u0101.\nIn his Mirror of the Heart, Bha\u1e6d\u1e6da N\u0101yaka (ca. 900 CE) argues that \u0100nandavardhana is mistaken to think of rasa as something like linguistic meaning, and instead focuses on the emotional response of the reader (Pollock 2016, Ollett 2020). His argument is that rasa cannot be the kind of thing which is the meaning of a sentence\u2014it is an experiential event which is caused by sentences. Drawing on M\u012bm\u0101\u1e43s\u0101 hermeneutics, which emphasizes how Vedic language causes hearers to follow injunctions, Bha\u1e6d\u1e6da N\u0101yaka proposes a multi-part process in which the primary meaning function operates in a normal manner, but subsequently there is what Pollock calls an \u201caesthetic text-event\u201d that unifies the disparate parts of a poem through a generalizing power (bh\u0101vakatva, De 1960 and Pollock 2016). The audience has the ability to enjoy (Pollock: \u201cexperientialize\u201d) the result through a particular aesthetic capability (bhojakatva), and the result is a transcendent, rapturous experience of rasa. Though understanding N\u0101yaka\u2019s account is difficult, given some textual problems, Ollett 2020 argues that his idea of \u201cactualizing\u201d multiple parts of a text has a parallel with the process by which we understand a unified sentence meaning from the parts of a sentence. While rasa is not a linguistic meaning the way that a sentence meaning is, on this understanding, it, like sentence meaning, is something unified understood in dependence on multiple constituent parts.\nMahima Bha\u1e6d\u1e6da (ca. 1025 CE) does not consider rasa anything more than an emotion which has been stabilized into the object of a particular kind of aesthetic enjoyment. His Analysis of \u201cManifestation\u201d argues that, since the characters in a poem are unreal, the emotions they are experiencing are also unreal, and must be inferred or imputed to them. All of the talk of \u201cmanifesting\u201d rasa is itself a figure of speech, on Mahima Bha\u1e6d\u1e6da\u2019s view. In addition, he argues that any putative \u201csecondary meaning\u201d such as indication (lak\u1e63a\u1e47\u0101) is also inferred. Primary meaning plays an evidentiary role in inference based on rules of pervasion (vy\u0101pti) between the primary meaning and secondary or suggested meaning. This position is criticized by later thinkers, since the relationship between primary meaning and these other meanings does not easily admit of universalizable regularities, and suggested meanings are often defeasible (see the entry on logic in classical Indian philosophy for discussion of inference).\nLike Bha\u1e6d\u1e6da N\u0101yaka and Mahima Bha\u1e6d\u1e6da, Mukula Bha\u1e6d\u1e6da agrees with \u0100nandavardhana that there are poetic phenomena that require explanation. He argues that these meanings arise from the existing category of secondary meaning, indication (lak\u1e63a\u1e47\u0101), rather than the third linguistic capacity of suggested meaning. His Fundamentals of the Communicative Function, through analysis of many of the stock examples of suggestion in the Light on Suggestion, identifies the necessary features which trigger indication: an obstacle in the primary meaning, a relationship between the primary and indicated meaning, and a motive or conventional basis for the indicated meaning. Mukula argues that it is possible to have cases of indicated meaning which do not completely replace the primary meaning. Mukula\u2019s work comes to be widely influential through its incorporation into the Illumination of Poetry (K\u0101vyaprak\u0101\u015ba) written by later philosopher of aesthetics Mamma\u1e6da, who excerpts parts of it verbatim (McCrea 2008).\nRather than explain suggested meaning as part of secondary meaning, the Pr\u0101bh\u0101kara school of M\u012bm\u0101\u1e43s\u0101 prefers to incorporate it into primary meaning. Their position, which is discussed in more detail below, criticizes the Bh\u0101\u1e6d\u1e6da distinction between primary and secondary meaning. On their view, word meanings do not\u2014as per the Bh\u0101\u1e6d\u1e6da M\u012bm\u0101\u1e43s\u0101 view\u2014have a fixed primary meaning regardless of sentence context. Instead, the meaning of a word will vary depending on its relationship with other words in a given sentence. Thus a word can carry a putatively \u201csuggested\u201d meaning simply through force of context. \u0100nandavardhana himself implicitly criticizes this position, arguing that suggested meaning function has a different object, since it does not result directly from the word, but from the primary meaning of the word. For instance, the well-known case of \u201cA village is on the Ganges\u201d suggests the purity of the village\u2014but this cannot be the primary meaning of the word \u201cGanges\u201d even contextually. It is an additional meaning, conveyed subsequent to the ordinary meaning of \u201cGanges\u201d (DL).\n4. Criticizing the Distinction\nNot all thinkers accept that there is a genuine difference between primary and secondary meaning. The rejection of this distinction happens in several different ways. First, and most radically, one might flatten the distinction to the point at which all language is equally \u201cnon-literal,\u201d and reject the idea that there is a foundational stratus of meaning. This is the view of some Buddhists, although just how to cash out this idea is a significant question. Second, one might argue that while there is a pragmatic reason to distinguish between primary and secondary meaning, this distinction does not map onto any genuine facts about language or its relationship with the world. Loosely, this is the view of Grammarian Bhart\u1e5bhari, whose spho\u1e6da or \u201cburst\u201d theory is that words are simply useful heuristics, but not real in any robust sense. Finally, one might argue that word-meanings are highly context-dependent to the extent that it is not useful to think of a single \u201cprimary\u201d meaning for a word. This is the position of Pr\u0101bh\u0101kara M\u012bm\u0101\u1e43sakas who do, however, make room for secondary meaning in a sense.\n4.1 Buddhism\nBuddhism and Jainism, two so-called \u201cheteroprax\u201d (Veda-rejecting) traditions in India, put forward analyses of language which challenge the notion of a distinction between primary and secondary meaning, at least as drawn in the orthoprax schools. Significant textual work\u2014as well as secondary scholarship\u2014remains to be done in the area of how both of these traditions (especially Jainism) understand language, but there are some clear themes.\nBuddhist thinkers are broadly committed to error theories about ordinary language use. As noted already, early Buddhists, in texts such as The Questions of King Milinda (Milindapa\u00f1h\u0101), argue for a kind of conventionalism: language which seems to refer to persistent whole objects, such as chariots and persons, does not, as such objects are taken to lack true existence. Later philosophical reflection, such as in the Commentary on the Treasury of Dharma (Abhidharmako\u015babh\u0101\u1e63ya) of Vasubandhu (ca fourth to fifth century CE, see the entry on Vasubandhu), presents a kind of local fictionalism or reductionism, as the only truly existing things are atomic simples which exist momentarily. Thus, all language is, save for claims about ultimately real constituent parts, loose speech. Buddhist philosophy of language is famous for its \u201ctwo truths\u201d doctrine (see the entry on the theory of two truths in India), the notion that there is conventional truth and ultimate truth\u2014but this gets deployed variously among the later schools such as Yog\u0101c\u0101ra and Madhyamaka (see Siderits 2003 and Garfield 2006).\nA commitment to the ubiquitous nature of non-literal speech is seen explicitly in Buddhist texts which pick up on the existing categories in Grammarian and Aesthetic thought, such as cognitive superimposition or metaphor (upac\u0101ra), and employ them to undermine the orthoprax theories of language which were realist and referential in nature (Gold 2007 and Tzohar 2018). For instance, the Yog\u0101c\u0101ra Buddhist Sthiramati, in his Commentary on the Thirty Verses (Tri\u1e43\u015bik\u0101bh\u0101\u1e63ya) (ca sixth century CE), cites a common Grammarian definition of upac\u0101ra, noting that use of the term \u201cself\u201d and \u201cthings\u201d is an instance of such figurative talk (Tzohar 2018). Not only is the self, when talked about in apparently ordinary ways, really being talked about indirectly, but this is so for all words which, on Sthiramati\u2019s Yog\u0101c\u0101ra view, refer to an individual\u2019s conscious experience of qualities, and not things in themselves. For Sthiramati, at least, there is a sense in which all language is \u201cmetaphorical,\u201d though grounded in the conscious arising and perishing of experiential events, rather than a (putatively) objective external reality.\nAnother way in which this conventionalism plays out is in the development of the apoha theory of concepts, which has important implications for how language functions. The term apoha means \u201cexclusion.\u201d This theory first presented in the work of fifth to sixth century CE philosopher Di\u1e45n\u0101ga (see the entry on Dharmak\u012brti, and the discussion of the theory of apoha). The theory of exclusion is meant to explain how we can have conceptual connections (linguistic or otherwise) with the world even though, on this Buddhist view, reality is ultimately a series of unique, momentarily-existing, ineffable particulars. Without universals or qualities, the Buddhists have a difficulty explaining how talk of a \u201cblue lotus,\u201d for instance, is possible. Their ingenious solution, much debated after Di\u1e45n\u0101ga, is to propose that we carve up the world conceptually by negation. Blueness is not a universal, but the exclusion of all non-blue particular things\u2014it is to be \u201cnot non-blue.\u201d How this theory works in detail is the subject of Dharmak\u012brti\u2019s work (ca sixth to seventh century CE) and a whole host of later thinkers, such as Ratnak\u012brti (ca eleventh century CE). The philosopher of aesthetics Bh\u0101maha (ca sixth to seventh century CE) criticizes apoha in his Ornaments of Poetry (K\u0101vy\u0101la\u1e45k\u0101ra), but not with regard to any distinction between primary and secondary meaning. Rather, he argues that the sense of a word is positive, and that on apoha, Buddhists are assigning two capacities to words\u2014exclusion and positive designation\u2014when there is only one (KB). M\u012bm\u0101\u1e43s\u0101 and Ny\u0101ya philosophers likewise criticize apoha extensively on these and similar grounds.\nBuddhist thought also takes up the distinction between kinds of meaning in its approach to hermeneutics, with regard to the interpretation of s\u016btra passages, not unlike the way in which Vedic hermeneutics both informs and is informed by M\u012bm\u0101\u1e43s\u0101 philosophical reflection on language. Buddhist hermeneutics, despite its being positioned \u201coutside\u201d of the orthopraxy, employs lists of figures which pre-date the rise of the textual tradition of Sanskrit poetics, in a way which demonstrates that there were links between the Grammarian, Ny\u0101ya, M\u012bm\u0101\u1e43s\u0101, and Buddhist theories of meaning (Tzohar 2018). A crucial concept in Buddhist hermeneutics, which approaches a distinction between literal and non-literal, is that of up\u0101ya or \u201cskillful means.\u201d With the assumption that the Buddha speaks both truthfully and with an eye towards the abilities of his particular audience, the notion of \u201cskillful means\u201d allows Buddhist hermeneuticists to explain apparently contradictory elements within Buddhist texts. As with Bh\u0101\u1e6d\u1e6da M\u012bm\u0101\u1e43s\u0101 use of secondary meaning for Vedic interpretation, recourse to secondary meaning in the face of apparent contradiction, skillful means allowed for truth-preservation while constraining the interpretive process.\n4.2 Jainism\nOriginating with Mah\u0101v\u012bra, who lives around the same time as Siddh\u0101rtha Gautama, the founder of Buddhism (sixth century BCE), Jainism is known for its emphasis on language\u2019s representational limitations. This is because of its view that reality is multi-faceted (anek\u0101ntav\u0101da) and any single description will necessarily involve some apparent contradiction, due to the fact that it is incomplete (Balcerowicz 2001). Without relativization to a standpoint (naya), the sentences \u201co is P\u201d and \u201co is not-P\u201d are contradictory. To address this, Jainas propose that there are seven ways to characterize any purported fact, each one preceded by a marker of uncertainty, sy\u0101t. Any object o and its property P can be described as:\n\no is P.\no is not-P.\no is both P and not-P.\no is beyond words.\no is beyond words and P.\no is beyond words and not-P.\no is beyond words and both P and not-P.\n\nThis seven-fold schema is found in many Jaina texts, from the early works of Kundakunda (3rd to 6th centuries) up to the to the important Flower Garland of Conditional Predication (Sy\u0101dv\u0101dama\u00f1jar\u012b) of Malli\u1e63e\u1e47a (13th century CE). While some, like Priest (2008), have argued that this seven-fold classification scheme lends itself to a paraconsistent (and perhaps also dialethic) formalization, it need not be, as within the scheme, each of the seven standpoints follows the law of non-contradiction, though within a many-valued truth-system (Ganeri 2002; Schang 2013). On this interpretation, the truth of an utterance is relativized to a particular context, in the sense that each standpoint restricts the context, as Balcerowicz argues, through indices such as space, time, convention, and so on (Balcerowicz 2001). (Balcerowicz also questions whether modern formalization is an eisegetical enterprise, reading into the text conceptions of axiomatization which were not present; see Balcerowicz 2015.) Minimally, according to Siddhar\u1e63iga\u1e47i (ca tenth century CE), one must include in one\u2019s analysis of any given utterance the speaker\u2019s intention and the relevant linguistic connections (Clerbout, Gorisse, & Rahman 2018). The schema, further, is hierarchically ordered, so that each standpoint includes more indices than the prior, according to Malli\u1e63e\u1e47a (Balcerowicz 2001).\nEmphasis on speaker\u2019s intention is crucial for Jainas, especially insofar as they hold to a division between two standpoints: the ordinary standpoint (vyavah\u0101ranaya) and the transcendent or ultimate standpoint (ni\u015bcayanaya, p\u0101ram\u0101rthikanaya). Ultimately speaking, language cannot be said to have any inherent communicative power, but rather it functions due to the speaker\u2019s authority and position as having unmediated access to the truth. In fact, the Jainas hold that scriptures containing the words of Mah\u0101v\u012bra are not efficacious due to the words themselves\u2014a stark contrast to the M\u012bm\u0101\u1e43s\u0101 view of an unauthored Veda\u2014but due to a unique suggestive power as well as the religious purity of the listener. As a result of these principles, any single utterance is susceptible to a number of different analyses. Fl\u00fcgel (2010) distinguishes between four kinds of analysis in Jaina thinking about language:\n\nPrinciples and criteria for religious speech\nGeneral rules and clauses for language usage\nContext-sensitive rules for proper ways of speaking\nExamples considering social implications\n\nThe existence of normative criteria governing language use, aiming at the avoidance of harm (ahi\u1e41s\u0101) and the preservation of truth (satya) can be compared to Gricean conversational maxims, although the intentional flouting of these principles does not lead to conversational implicatures. In fact, Jaina doctrines discourage ambiguity and emphasize precise speech (Fl\u00fcgel 2010).\n4.3 Pr\u0101bh\u0101kara M\u012bm\u0101\u1e43s\u0101\nIn their explanation of word-meaning, Pr\u0101bh\u0101kara M\u012bm\u0101\u1e43sakas emphasize the relationship of words with one another in a token utterance. \u015a\u0101likan\u0101tha (ca. 7th century CE), in his Monograph in Five Chapters (Prakara\u1e47apa\u00f1cik\u0101), argues that, to avoid multiplying denotative capacities for words in different contexts, one should posit the ability for words to denote meanings-in-relation. This position is called \u201cdenotation of what is related\u201d (anvit\u0101bhidh\u0101na) and it is opposed to the Bh\u0101\u1e6d\u1e6da M\u012bm\u0101\u1e43s\u0101 analysis discussed earlier (abhihit\u0101nvaya). The principle of parsimony is central to Pr\u0101bh\u0101kara arguments. On the Bh\u0101\u1e6d\u1e6da view, there are multiple levels of meaning and a complex process of moving from a word to a word meaning to a unified sentence which connects those meanings. \u015a\u0101likan\u0101tha argues that it would be better to explain the resultant connections (anvaya) among word meanings as being understood directly from the word. The idea that the same operation is responsible for unifying the word meanings into a sentence anticipates, to a degree, Frege\u2019s idea of word meanings as unsaturated entities, although \u015a\u0101likan\u0101tha is not thinking in the same ontological terms (see the discussion of semantic power and the reduction of semantic properties in the entry on analytic philosophy in the entry on early modern India, and Siderits 1991).\nPr\u0101bh\u0101kara thinkers deny that the meaning of a \u201ccow\u201d is a universal and that indication is necessary to shift the generic referent of the noun to a particular. \u015a\u0101likan\u0101tha argues that while it may be true that something the same is remembered in each case when someone says \u201ccow,\u201d this remnant of memory is not the same thing as a word meaning (PS: 381ff, Ollett 2020b). Meaning has to do with the role that a word\u2019s cognition plays within a sentence. Further, he argues that a word conveys the universal and the particular together, since the first cannot be understood without the second. So, while he agrees with the Bh\u0101\u1e6d\u1e6das that a series of universals cannot be connected together in a qualificative relationship, he concludes that this is a reason to reject the view that words primarily communicate generalities (s\u0101m\u0101nya), arguing that they must communicate a qualified thing (vi\u015be\u1e63ana).\nHowever, \u015a\u0101likan\u0101tha does leave room for the distinction between primary and secondary meaning in cases like \u201cThe village is on the Ganges\u201d and \u201cThe boy is a lion.\u201d He argues that where the ordinary meaning of words cannot form a connective relationship then there is recourse to secondary meaning. So in the case of words like \u201cGanges\u201d and \u201clion,\u201d the meaning\u2013in\u2013relation which is in connection with other word meanings is the secondary meaning, not the primary meaning. Despite this allowance for a distinction, the Pr\u0101bh\u0101kara view is often touted as a radically contextualist approach. For instance, Abhinavagupta, who lived after the highly influential \u015a\u0101likan\u0101tha, characterizes the Pr\u0101bh\u0101kara position as one on which there is no distinction between primary meaning, secondary meaning, or suggestion. He says that their view is that the meaning of the word is simply its final result (1.4b The Eye, DL). He points, however, out that the Pr\u0101bh\u0101kara M\u012bm\u0101\u1e43s\u0101 must accept different kinds of statements in the Vedas for exegetical purposes\u2014some more direct than others\u2014and thus they should have no problem in principle allowing for suggested meaning.\nPr\u0101bh\u0101karas emphasize three concepts in their account of word and sentence meaning: expectancy (\u0101k\u0101\u1e45k\u1e63\u0101), cognitive proximity (sannidhi), and semantic fittingness (yogyat\u0101). Depending on the word\u2019s role in a sentence, it will have different expectancies. This expectancy also varies depending on which word meanings are presented to the subject\u2019s mind as candidates for connection\u2014or which meanings have cognitive proximity (these may not be words which uttered in sequence, as a connected subject and verb may be separated by a dependent clause). Finally, the goal of a sentence is to convey something meaningful, so the word meanings in relation must work together semantically: a sentence such as \u201cSprinkle the garden with fire\u201d would fail to have semantic fittingness. These three criteria determine what the meaning-in-relations are which result in a sentence. Secondary meaning is resorted to when there is no relation possible (anvay\u0101nupapatti), such as when the word \u201cvillage\u201d cannot be related to \u201con the Ganges,\u201d since this expression would lack semantic fittingness. These three concepts are not restricted to Pr\u0101bh\u0101karas, however, but are discussed and refined in various ways by nearly all of the intellectual traditions treating language (see section 5.1).\n4.4 Spho\u1e6da Theory\nIn his Treatise on Sentences and Words, the grammarian Bhart\u1e5bhari (ca. 450 CE) takes up the distinction between primary and secondary meaning in more detail than previous grammarians such as P\u0101\u1e47ini and Pata\u00f1jali. His work is difficult\u2014he is aware of, and engages with, Buddhist, Jaina, and M\u012bm\u0101\u1e43s\u0101 views of language, but not in a straightforward dialectical manner, as is the style of many other Indian thinkers. This causes controversy over his established views (for discussion of which see Cardona 1999). In terms of his position on the division between primary and secondary meaning, the interpretive debate centers on the implications of the spho\u1e6da-theory for the possibility of such a distinction.\nIn Bhart\u1e5bhari\u2019s work, the term spho\u1e6da, meaning \u201cburst,\u201d refers to the indivisible nature of the utterance\u2014it is a sound which carries meaning, and which cannot be subdivided into words or particular phonemes. (One might think here of Wittgenstein\u2019s Philosophical Investigations, e.g., 1953 [2001]: 191, and the idea of grasping meaning in a \u201cflash\u201d\u2014and indeed, this connection has been explored in Bhattacharyya 2002 and elsewhere.) On one prevailing understanding of spho\u1e6da, Bhart\u1e5bhari is committed to a kind of linguistic monism, which not only denies the divisibility of utterances into grammatical categories, but asserts the identity of speech and reality. Thus any apparent distinctions between categories\u2014letters, words, semantic powers\u2014are illusory. He uses common examples of illusion in Indian philosophy to underscore this point: from far away, a large tree may look like an elephant; at a glance, a rope may appear to be a snake. However, these are misperceptions, as are the putative semantic distinctions we make (Raja 1969).\nJan E.F. Houben, in his translation of the \u201cExposition on (Semantic) Relationship\u201d (Sambandhasamudde\u015ba) chapter of the Treatise, which treats figurative language extensively, argues that Bhart\u1e5bhari does distinguish between primary and secondary meaning, but on pragmatic grounds (Houben 1995). Houben thinks that Bhart\u1e5bhari is a linguistic perspectivist, in the sense that his concern is not to argue against any particular philosophical position, but to show the limits of formal analysis itself. On this view, when Bhart\u1e5bhari appeals to the analogy with perceptual illusion, it is merely to dismantle the commitment to a certain theory of reference: that which presupposes words refer to external reality. Recently, Tzohar has argued that Bhart\u1e5bhari holds a \u201cpan-figurative\u201d account, on which all words \u201cfiguratively signify\u201d (Tzohar 2018: 70). On this view, word reference does not require a relationship with external referents. In contrast, all language use is \u201cfigurative\u201d in the sense that it does not require correspondence. This interpretation incorporates but goes beyond Houben\u2019s perspectivism, drawing out implications for the limits of language in connecting with reality.\nOn the linguistic monism view, Bhart\u1e5bhari is anticipating later Advaita Ved\u0101nta monism, on which empirical reality is illusory and Brahman, without having any genuine properties, is the basis for this illusion. His linguistic analysis, however, need not rely on these metaphysical assumptions in order to underscore the centrality of the sentence for meaning. Saying that grammatical categories and stable word-meanings are constructed (kalpita) based on theoretical needs, is to observe the priority of ordinary use and the role of context for actual communication. The perspectivist interpretation emphasizes the epistemic elements in theory-construction, understanding the analogical argument from illusion as less concerned with error than the pragmatic grounds to our judgments.\n5. Implications of the Distinction\nDifferent positions on the distinction between primary and secondary meaning have implications for related philosophical topics. In the realm of philosophy of language, theories of sentence meaning depend on how word meaning is understood. Within philosophy of religion, scriptural hermeneutics is also contingent upon approaches to meaning. Finally, there are normative implications for speaking and producing works of poetry, given the distinction.\n5.1 Sentence Meaning\nWhile much of the discussion about primary and secondary meaning is centered on words, there are significant implications for sentence meaning. Among those who accept the genuine compositionality of sentences, contra the spho\u1e6da theorists above, there are two theories of how words combine in context to convey a unified meaning which differ over the role of secondary meaning.\nOn the \u201cconnection of denoted meanings\u201d view (abhihit\u0101nv\u0101ya) accepted by Bh\u0101\u1e6d\u1e6da M\u012bm\u0101\u1e43sakas, words convey their meanings, and then, in conjunction with three conditions, these meanings are related together through secondary meaning (lak\u1e63a\u1e47\u0101). The three conditions mentioned in section 4.3 are expectancy of connections (\u0101k\u0101\u1e45k\u1e63\u0101), semantic fit (yogyat\u0101), and cognitive contiguity (\u0101satti or sannidhi). Expectancy of connections is defined either syntactically or in terms of a hearer\u2019s psychological state of desiring words to fit together. Semantic fit is the requirement that the sentence makes sense, prima facie, and contiguity is the requirement that words are uttered in a temporally adjacent sequence or that they are closely related in the hearer\u2019s mind. The view that the meaning of a sentence is due to the secondary signification of words is not necessarily connected to Bh\u0101\u1e6d\u1e6da view that words denote universals, as V\u0101caspati, in his Drop of Truth (Tattvabindu), defends this position despite elsewhere subscribing to Ny\u0101ya theories of meaning. V\u0101caspati argues explicitly that indication is responsible for the relationship (anvaya) between word-meanings and argues that it is commensurate with a Naiy\u0101yika position (Sastri 2014; Phillips 2015).\nIn favor of this view, its defenders observe that there must be some common word-meaning among sentences such as \u201cBring the cow,\u201d \u201cSee the cow,\u201d \u201cBring the sheep,\u201d and \u201cSee the sheep\u201d in order for hearers to understand what is being communicated. What we learn as language-users, through trial and error and association of these various sentences with the world, is the invariable meaning of the words. Against this \u201cconnection of denoted meanings\u201d view, \u015a\u0101likan\u0101tha and other Pr\u0101bh\u0101kara philosophers, as discussed earlier, argue that what is remembered on hearing an individual word does not constitute a genuine meaning without its being connected to the other words\u2014emphasizing the inferential element of meaning. Their view, the \u201cdesignation of meanings-as-connected\u201d (anvit\u0101bhidh\u0101na), rejects the role of secondary meaning as a sentence-unifier.\nJayanta Bha\u1e6d\u1e6da, a Ny\u0101ya philosopher, takes up a third position, on which word-purport (t\u0101tparya) plays the unifying functional role. This sense of t\u0101tparya is different from later uses of the term to mean speaker intention. His theory of word-purport is accepted by Abhinavagupta who includes it in The Eye 1.4 among his list of functions (v\u1e5btti-s) of language: the primary, secondary, word-purport, and suggestion (Graheli 2016). For both Jayanta and Abhinavagupta, the idea that the secondary meaning function is also responsible for sentential unity was unacceptable. Abhinavagupta summarizes the four capacities and their characteristics as\n\nPrimary meaning (abhidh\u0101) \u2013 conveys the individual word-meanings in their ordinary sense, according to convention\nPurport (t\u0101tparya) \u2013 conveys the entire sentence meaning which would not otherwise be intelligible\nSecondary meaning (lak\u1e63a\u1e47\u0101) \u2013 along with factors like blocking the ordinary sense, conveys another meaning\nSuggestion (dhvani) \u2013 along with the hearer\u2019s imaginative abilities, based on the first three powers, it suggests another meaning.\n\nThe crucial distinction between the \u201cconnection of denoted meanings\u201d view and the two others is whether the secondary meaning function has a role to play before the sentence meaning is understood. Abhinavagupta explicitly says that it is not possible to have an obstacle for primary meaning without first understanding the syntactical connections among words. Thus secondary meaning can only occur after the capacity of purport. He distinguishes between nonsensical but syntactically acceptable sentences such as \u201cThere are a hundred elephants on the tip of my finger\u201d and phrases which are syntactically faulty, \u201cTen pomegranates, six pancakes\u201d (DL: 1.4b L, page 86).\nFinally, Mukula Bha\u1e6d\u1e6da identifies a theory, most likely his own, which he calls \u201cthe combined view\u201d (Keating 2019). It takes secondary meaning to apply both before and after sentence meaning. His understanding of secondary meaning is broader than both \u015a\u0101likan\u0101tha and Abhinavagupta, as it does not always replace the primary meaning. So it can play the role of purport and can also encompass the function of suggestion. Thus, where the division between primary and secondary meaning is made, and how secondary meaning is characterized has important consequences for all these views of sentence meaning.\n5.2 Scriptural Hermeneutics\nPrimary and secondary meaning, and the boundaries between them, figured significantly in discussion over scriptural interpretation. The topic is implicated in general discussions about how to approach hermeneutics, in particular by M\u012bm\u0101\u1e43s\u0101 and Ved\u0101nta philosophers. Particular doctrinal or philosophical positions presented in, for example, the Upani\u1e63ads or the Vedas, are subject to scrutiny based on whether they should be taken literally or not. The M\u012bm\u0101\u1e43s\u0101 system of hermeneutics, as Rajendran (2001) and McCrea (2008) have shown, subsequently comes to influence the analysis of poetic meaning.\nWhile he is not a M\u012bm\u0101\u1e43saka (he is called a sarva-tantra-sva-tantra, someone for whom all systems are his own), even V\u0101caspati, in his Drop of Truth mentioned above, takes up the question of the impact of theories of secondary meaning on the interpretation of the Vedas. He is a proponent of the view that indication acts as \u201cglue,\u201d metaphorically speaking, and secures the relationship between word-meanings\u2014but this might threaten the possibility that the Vedas convey meaning secondarily, since indication requires appeal to speaker intention to make sense. This, says his opponent, threatens Vedic authority. While V\u0101caspati\u2019s initial dry remark is to say, well, so much for Vedic authority, he steps back by postulating that the ordinary use of elders (vrddhavyavah\u0101ra) lets us understand, lacking a genuine person who authors the words. He thus preserves the principle that Vedic and ordinary language are cut from the same cloth, as both require indication for sentence meaning (Sastri 2014; Phillips 2015).\nIn the Thorough Investigation of Truth (Tattvasam\u012bk\u1e63\u0101), a commentary on Ma\u1e47\u1e0dana Mi\u015bra\u2019s The Demonstration of Brahman (Brahmasiddhi), V\u0101caspati argues for the truth of the Upani\u1e63adic claim of non-duality between self and reality, against an interlocutor who would interpret the Upani\u1e63ads in a figurative manner. At stake is the role of language in relationship to other sources of knowledge. The opponent objects to the conflict between sense perception and the putatively ordinary meaning of the Upani\u1e63ads, since this would entail that sense perception\u2014which delivers knowledge of a world apart from the self\u2014is flawed. They argue that, when such conflicts arise, perception should prevail, and a figurative meaning should be preferred. V\u0101caspati objects on a number of grounds, first noting that there must be a relationship between a primary and secondary meaning (one cannot simply leap to a secondary meaning when it is convenient). Then he appeals to the principle already described in detail\u2014when it is not possible to interpret the ordinary meaning in a sensible manner, this is the impetus for secondary meaning. Conflict with other knowledge sources is not the catalyst for figurative interpretation (V\u0101caspatimi\u015bra, VT: 29\u201332).\n5.3 Normative Implications\nIn addition to contentful philosophical implications, the distinction between primary and secondary meaning has an impact on how philosophy is done. For instance, NS 1.2.10ff, in outlining the appropriate terms of philosophical debate, defines the flaw of casuistry (vim\u0101\u1e43sa) as misusing words to mislead one\u2019s opponent. There are a number of types of casuistry, one of which is figurative. V\u0101tsy\u0101yana, in his commentary (NBh 1.2.14), cites one of the stock examples of secondary meaning of the indicative type: \u201cThe stands are shouting.\u201d Here, where the meaning is that people seated on wooden structures are shouting, it would be casuistry to reply, \u201cNo, the stands are not shouting, but the people are shouting.\u201d This overly literal interlocutor pretends to misunderstand the speaker\u2019s intention, and makes there to be conflict when there is none. Whether or not this kind of debate flaw is an importantly unique kind of casuistry (there is some discussion about this in the commentaries), Ny\u0101ya philosophers emphasize that verbal hair-splitting without charity towards one\u2019s debate opponent constitutes a condemnable manner of intellectual speech (NS 1.2.2, Todeschini 2010).\nWe have already seen in section 4.2 that Jainas emphasize careful speech using the ordinary, not figurative, meanings of words. M\u012bm\u0101\u1e43s\u0101 has a similar emphasis on correct speech, especially in the context of Vedic rituals. The utterances of mantras\u2014parts of the Veda which accompany ritual practice\u2014had to be performed precisely in order to guarantee the efficacy of the procedure (and mispronunciation in a ritual context was equal to sinful lying). Thus the study of grammatical rules was important, as these included pronunciation and modification of words to fit a new context (declining nouns into the plural, adjusting utterances to incorporate different deity names, and so forth). Further, grammar was a corrective to ordinary use, which is only an imperfect a guide to correct interpretation of Vedic words. Distinguishing between commands in the primary sense of words and figurative language exhortations was also crucial for M\u012bm\u0101\u1e43s\u0101, since the proper interpretation of the latter was relevant for the performance of the ritual. For example, the exhortation, \u201cThe grass-bedding is the ritual patron\u201d (TV 1.4.13) is a case of secondary meaning of the qualitative type (gau\u1e47av\u1e5btti), which praises the central role of the ritual patron. Kum\u0101rila observes that misunderstanding this meaning would lead to absurdity, since the grass-bedding (a woven mat of grass on which ritual implements are placed) is burned up\u2014and taking the phrase literally would mean putting an early stop to the ritual process if the patron himself were burned (Harikai 2017).\nFinally, Aesthetics interweaves normative implications throughout. Poetry is not merely for pleasure, but incorporates moral figures (one is instructed to be like R\u0101ma, the hero of the R\u0101m\u0101ya\u1e47a, and not like R\u0101va\u1e47a, the evil demon) and presupposes an entire moral structure. Abhinavagupta, in his independent works, takes up the theory of suggestion into the philosophy of Kashmir \u015aaivism, a tantric tradition which devotes itself to the deity \u015aiva. For Abhinavagupta, rasa is not merely an aesthetic phenomenon, but it is a profound sense of unity with transcendent reality, found in the rasa of peacefulness (\u015b\u0101nti) which encompasses all others. Still, one need not go so far as Abhinavagupta\u2019s work to see the normative dimension in Aesthetics, since even in \u0100nandavardhana\u2019s more ordinary understanding of rasa, there are certain emotions which are appropriate to bring into existence, and others which ought to be avoided. What is appropriate is dependent on the character\u2019s social position, gender, and so on. These norms also constrain the interpretive possibilities of suggested meaning, providing a conventional basis for the creative use of language.\n",
