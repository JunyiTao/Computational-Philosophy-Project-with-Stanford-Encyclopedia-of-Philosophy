    "main_text": "The Cognitive Science of Cultural Capacities || Culture and Individual Learning\n3.2 Culture and Individual Learning\n\nWhile social learning is a central concern to those focused on\nculture, other forms of learning are also important for understanding\nthe range of interactions between cognition, culture and its\naccumulation, and perhaps the evolution of cultural capacities\nthemselves. For instance, while social learning appears to be suited\nto contribute to the rapid spread of new behaviors and\nbeliefs in a population, individual learning may be better suited to\ncontribute to the initial generation of new behaviors, novel\nbeliefs, and to the production of innovations on existing\ncultural variants. Theorists have carved out different positions on\nhow the distinction between individual and social learning should be\nconceived, and how these two facets of cultural capacities might\ninteract.\n\nCognitive scientists have traditionally been interested in learning,\nbroadly defined as the acquisition by individuals of new information,\nknowledge, and skills. There is also an established history of\nresearch on related cognitive phenomena such as attention, perception\nand memory, much of which focuses on identifying functions and causal\nmechanisms, and on developing methods to optimize learning and memory\n(De Houwer & Hughes 2020). Historically speaking, the distinction\nbetween social and individual learning does not seem to have been\ngiven much theoretical significance. Those participating in cognitive\nscience\u2019s recent cultural turn accord it greater importance.\n\nEfforts to articulate a precise and theoretically useful version of\nthat distinction have run into complications, however, and have not\nalways yielded intuitive results. For example, an episode of learning\ncan be plausibly classified as social if a conspecific facilitates the\nacquisition of new information (Heyes 1994, 2012). Individual\nlearning, on the other hand, is often construed as acquiring new\ninformation directly from the environment. But these specifications\nare not mutually exclusive, and together they entail that many\nepisodes of human learning qualify as both individual and\nsocial. The environments that our species inhabits are often\nthemselves engineered, and are thus to a large extent shaped by other\nhumans, often in ways specifically designed to facilitate learning\n(Sterelny 2012; J. Henrich 2016; Lewens 2017). As many have noted,\nthis is an important form of (epistemic) niche construction and\necological inheritance. It bears important similarities to behaviors\nfound in a range of other species whose members live in environments\nthat are deeply shaped by other members (and sometimes previous\ngenerations) of their own species (Laland, Odling-Smee, & Feldman\n2000; Kendal, Tehrani, & Odling-Smee 2011; Aaby & Ramsey\nforthcoming). In response to such difficulties, others have urged that\nindividual learning should be distinguished from social learning in\nthat only episodes of the latter involve social transmission,\nunderstood as happening when \u201cthe behaviour of an individual\n[comes] to resemble the behaviour of others through social\ninteraction\u201d (Heyes 2021: 228; also see R. Boyd, Richerson,\n& Henrich 2011).\n\nAside from the question of how specific episodes of learning should be\nclassified, there seems to be something close to consensus about\nfunctionality. Broadly construed, the primary adaptive function of\nindividual learning is to generate information that is useful for\ndealing with (often novel features of) one\u2019s environment. The\nadaptive value of social learning, on the other hand, comes from\navoiding the costs of individual learning, allowing an individual to\nacquire useful information from others without having to go through\nthe trouble of figuring it out on their own. This consensus, however,\ngives rise to a puzzle whose solution remains a matter of controversy\n(Rogers 1988). What has become known as Rogers\u2019 paradox centers\non the question of how capacities for social learning could have\nevolved. The difficulty arises from the thought that pure social\nlearners would be unable to help increase the mean fitness of the\npopulations they invade or in which they live, because they would be\nunable to contribute any innovations or useful new information. They\nwould just imitate others, copying what is already there. From this\nperspective, social learners are free-riders, exploiting the knowledge\nand skills created by the epistemic work of individual learners while\nproviding nothing novel or beneficial in return (Laland 2004).\n\nNevertheless, social learning is undeniably found in a range of\nspecies, with humans exhibiting especially sophisticated forms of\nsocial transmission. Some proposed solutions to Rogers\u2019 paradox\nhave emphasized that capacities for social learning can be adaptive\n(and thus evolve and spread) if social learning is selective.\nIndividuals can use mixed strategies, strategically switching between\nindividual and social learning in different circumstances (Enquist,\nEriksson, & Ghirlanda 2007). They can also be selective about who\nthey learn from, when, and in what domains of knowledge (J. Henrich\n& McElreath 2003; Buttelman et al. 2013; Koenig & Sabbagh\n2013). Others hold that capacities for social learning likely evolved\nfrom capacities for individual learning, in a process of descent with\nmodification that was driven by gene-culture coevolutionary processes\nand the kind of epistemic niche construction mentioned above (Sterelny\n2021: chapter 1; Kendal, Boogert, et al. 2018; also see Heyes 2018a\nand Taylor, et al 2021).\n",
