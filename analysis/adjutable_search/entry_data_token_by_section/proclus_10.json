    "main_text": "Philosophical views || Theurgy\n3.6 Theurgy\n\n\nRelying on Plato, Theaetetus 176a-b late Platonists saw the\nassimilation to god (homoi\u00f4sis the\u00f4i) as\nthe goal (telos) of philosophy. Proclus was faithful to this\nideal, as is attested by his biographer Marinus (Life of\nProclus \u00a7 25). There was a fundamental discussion in late\nNeoplatonism on how this assimilation to the divine was\npossible for humans. Damascius (In Phaed. I \u00a7 172\nWesterink) distinguishes two tendencies: Plotinus and Porphyry\npreferred philosophy, which makes us understand the divine principles\nof reality through rational explication, while others like Iamblichus\nand his followers, Syrianus, and Proclus, gave priority to hieratic\npractice or theurgy (theourgia, hieratik\u00ea [sc.\ntechn\u00ea]). Their different evaluation of respectively\ntheory and theurgy as means of salvation may be explained by their\ndifferent views on the human soul and its possibilities of ascent to\nthe divine realm. While Plotinus and Porphyry claimed that the\nsuperior part of the human soul always remains within the intelligible\nrealm, in touch with the divine principles, and never completely\ndescends into the body, Iamblichus, followed by Proclus, criticised\nsuch a view.  The soul does indeed wholly descend into the body (Steel\n1978, 34\u201351). Hence the importance of theurgic rites established\nby the gods themselves, to make it possible for the human soul to\novercome the distance between the mortal and the divine, which cannot\nbe done through increasing philosophical\nunderstanding. In Theol. Plat. I 25, Proclus\nexpresses his great admiration for the power of theurgy, which\nsurpasses all human knowledge.\n\n\nAllegedly, Neoplatonic theurgy originated with Julian the theurgist,\nwho lived in the time of emperor Marcus Aurelius. At first sight,\ntheurgy seems to share many characteristics with magic (theory of\ncosmic sympathy, invocations, animation of statues of gods and demons),\nbut it is, as far as we can judge from the extant sources, clearly\ndifferent from it. In his De Mysteriis Iamblichus\ndeveloped a theology of the hieratic rituals from Platonic principles,\nwhich clearly sets them apart from the vulgar magical practices. While\nmagic assumes that the gods can be rendered subservient to the\nmagicians, Platonic philosophers consider this impossible. According to\nPlato\u2019s principles of theology (Republic II and\nLaws X), the gods are immutable, unchangeable, and cannot be\nbribed by means of sacrifices. Proclus\u2019 views on theurgy (of which\nonly some fragments belonging to his treatise On Hieratic Art\n[i.e., theurgy] survived) are fully in line with these fundamental\nPlatonic axioms. But how, then, does theurgy work? The theurgists take\nup an old belief, shared also by many philosophers, namely the natural\nand cosmic \u2018sympathy\u2019 (sumpatheia) pervading all\nreality. As with an organism, all parts of reality are somehow linked\ntogether as one. Another way of expressing this idea is in the\nNeoplatonic principle, going back at least to Iamblichus, that\neverything is in everything (panta\nen pasin). According to Proclus, all reality,\nincluding its most inferior level, matter, is directed upwards towards\nthe origin from which it proceeds. To say it in the words of Theodorus\nof Asine, whom Proclus quotes in his Commentary on the Timaeus\n(I 213.2\u20133): \u201cAll things pray except the First.\u201d \n\n\nAs stated before (cf. 3.3), the human soul contains the principles\n(logoi) of all reality within itself. The soul carries,\nhowever, also sumbola or sunth\u00eamata which\ncorrespond to the divine principles of reality. The same symbols also\nestablish the secret correspondences between sensible things (stones,\nplants, and animals) and celestial and divine realities. Thanks to\nthese symbols, things on different levels (stones, plants, animals,\nsouls) are linked in a \u2018chain\u2019 (seira) to the divine principle on\nwhich they depend, as the chain of the sun and the many solar beings,\nor the chain of the moon. Of great importance in the rituals was also\nthe evocation of the secret divine names. In his Commentary on the\nCratylus, Proclus compares divine names to statues of the gods\nused in theurgy (In Crat. \u00a7 46), pointing to\nthe fact that also language is an important means in the ascent to the\ndivine.\n\n\nProclus evokes the Platonic background of his theurgical beliefs,\nnamely his theory of love (er\u00f4s) as expressed in\nthe Symposium and the Phaedrus, in his\ntreatise On Hieratic Art:\n\n\nJust as lovers move on from the beauty perceived by the\nsenses until they reach the sole cause of all beautiful and\nintelligible beings, so too, the theurgists (hieratikoi),\nstarting with the sympathy connecting visible things both to one\nanother and to the invisible powers, and having understood that all\nthings are to be found in all things, established the hieratic\nscience. (trans. Ronan, modified)\n\n\nIn the wake of an article of Anne Sheppard (1982), scholars usually\ndistinguish between three kinds of theurgy in Proclus. The first kind,\nas described in the above quoted treatise On Hieratic Art, was\nmainly concerned with animating statues (in order to obtain oracles or\nto evoke divine apparitions) or, in general, with activities related to\nphysical phenomena or human affairs (influencing the weather, healing\nillnesses etc.) (see Life of Proclus \u00a7 28\u201329). As emerges\nfrom our sources, it is this kind of theurgy that involved much\nritualistic practice, including hymns and prayers. The second kind of\ntheurgy makes the soul capable of ascending up to the level of the\nhypercosmic gods and the divine intellect. This second kind too\noperates by means of prayers and invocations and it seems especially\ncharacteristic of Proclus\u2019 Hymns. And finally, the third\nkind of theurgy establishes unity with the first principles, that is\nthe One itself. This third kind corresponds to the level of the highest\nvirtues (i.e., \u2018theurgic virtues\u2019) in the scale of virtues.\nIt is not clear whether some form of ritual is involved here at all.\nFor this last stage of the Platonic homoi\u00f4sis\nthe\u00f4i the following elements are of major importance:\nnegative theology (culminating in the negation of the negation), mystic\nsilence and the intriguing notion of faith (pistis), which\nthus enters with a non-Platonic meaning - though even for the latter\nnotion Proclus will search for confirmation in the Platonic\ndialogues.\n\n\nThose who hasten to be conjoined with the Good, do no longer\nneed knowledge and activity, but need to be established and a stable\nstate and quietness. What then is it which unites us to the Good? What\nis it which causes in us a cessation of activity and motion? What is it\nwhich establishes all divine natures in the first and ineffable unity\nof goodness? [\u2026] It is, in short, the faith (pistis) of\nthe Gods, which ineffably unites all the classes of Gods, of daemons,\nand of blessed souls to the Good. For we should investigate the Good\nnot through knowledge (gn\u00f4stik\u00f4s) and in an\nimperfect manner, but giving ourselves up to the divine light, and\nclosing the eyes, to become thus established\nin the unknown and occult unity of beings. For such a kind of faith is\nmore venerable than cognitive activity, not in us only, but with the\nGods themselves. (Proclus, Platonic Theology,\nI 25, trans. Th. Taylor, modified).\n",
