    "main_text": "Mathematical explanation in the empirical sciences || Explanatory indispensability arguments\n1.4 Explanatory indispensability arguments\n\nMany philosophers are interested in non-causal mathematical\nexplanations in science because they seem to support an explanatory\nindispensability argument for a platonist interpretation of pure\nmathematics. Colyvan and Baker have been the most ardent defenders of\nsuch an argument (Colyvan 2001, 2010, Baker 2005, 2009a, 2022). In his\n2001 book Colyvan presented a general indispensability argument for\nthe existence of mathematical entities like the natural numbers:\n\n1.\nWe ought to have ontological commitment to all and only those\nentities that are indispensable to our best scientific theories;\n2.\nMathematical entities are indispensable to our best scientific\ntheories.\n\n\nTherefore:\n\n3.\nWe ought to have ontological commitment to mathematical entities\n(Colyvan 2001, 11).\n\n\nThis notion of ontological commitment was first articulated by Quine\n(Quine 2004, Putnam 2010). These commitments reflect what one should\nbelieve exists. Premise 1 is tied to a naturalistic approach to these\nbeliefs that claims they should be determined by the character of our\nbest scientific theories. For Quine, one\u2019s ontological\ncommitments are settled by the best regimentation of one\u2019s\nscientific theories into first-order logic, where what makes a\nregimentation the best is determined by ordinary scientific criteria\nlike consistency and simplicity. Some of Colyvan\u2019s cases in his\nbook invoked the explanatory contribution that mathematical entities\nmake to our best theories. If we suppose that one aim of science is to\nexplain, then a regimentation may be the best in part because it\naffords explanations of various scientific phenomena.\n\nAn explanatory version of this indispensability argument became more\nprominent after Melia\u2019s exchange with Colyvan (Melia 2000, 2002,\nColyvan 2002). Melia argued that indispensable quantification over\nmathematical entities was not sufficient for ontological commitment.\nAny such commitments could be canceled by a \u201cweaseling\u201d\nmaneuver that added \u201cbut I do not accept the existence of any\nmathematical entities.\u201d For example, one could use numbers to\ncount how many apples and pears one has and conclude that there are\nmore apples than pears. But Melia would then add that he rejected the\nexistence of natural numbers, thereby canceling that commitment.\nColyvan replied that such an addition was incoherent when the\nmathematical entities were explaining something, and Melia agreed:\n\u201cWere there clear examples where the postulation of mathematical\nobjects results in an increase in the same kind of utility as that\nprovided by the postulation of theoretical entities, then it would\nseem that the same kind of considerations that support the existence\nof atoms, electrons and space-time equally supports the existence of\nnumbers, functions and sets\u201d (Melia 2002, 75\u201376). The\ndebate about indispensability and platonism then largely turned to the\nevaluation of cases. \n\nBaker took up Melia\u2019s challenge by reformulating the argument so\nthat the explanatory question became central. Baker also introduced\nnew cases like the cicada case where the parallel between atoms and\nnumbers was meant to be clearer. In Baker\u2019s formulation, the\nargument is:\n\n1\u2032.\n We ought rationally to believe in the existence of any entity\nthat plays an indispensable explanatory role in our best scientific\ntheories.\n2\u2032.\n Mathematical objects play an indispensable explanatory role in\nscience.\n3\u2032.\n Hence, we ought rationally to believe in the existence of\nmathematical objects (Baker 2009a, 613, premises renumbered).\n\n\nThe emphasis on explanation in premise 1\u2032 is of course\nconsistent with Quine\u2019s process of regimentation. For example,\nwe opt for the theory of cicadas that best explains their character.\nIf we then work out the best regimentation of this theory, we will\nfind that it will entail that prime numbers exist. All premise\n1\u2032 maintains, then, is that one should endorse whatever these\nontological commitments turn out to be. However, a second way to\nsupport premise 1\u2032 is available: one could appeal to inference\nto the best explanation and its use to support scientific realism\nabout unobservable entities like electrons. Baker sometimes ties the\nappeal of his indispensability argument to scientific realism:\n\u201cA crucial plank of the scientific realist position involves\ninference to the best explanation (IBE) to justify the postulation in\nparticular cases of unobservable theoretical entities \u2026 the\nindispensability debate only gets off the ground if both sides take\nIBE seriously, which suggests that explanation is of key importance in\nthis debate\u201d (Baker 2005, 225). The appeal to IBE avoids the\nQuinean process of regimentation by directing our attention to some\nexplanatory target such as the length of the life-cycles of some\nspecies of cicada. If we are scientific realists, then we accept the\nuse of IBE in support of our claims about the existence of various\nentities. So if we find that the best explanation also includes\nabstract objects like prime numbers, then we should also accept their\nexistence.\n\nThree worries about this explanatory indispensability argument can be\nfruitfully distinguished. The first worry is that the argument is\nsomehow circular, begs the question or else fails to correctly\nidentify the basis for our knowledge of the existence of mathematical\nentities. The point was forcefully presented by Steiner in 1978.\nSteiner argues for the existence of mathematical explanations and also\nclaims to know of the existence of abstract, mathematical entities.\nHowever, \u201cno explanatory argument can establish the existence of\nmathematical entities\u201d (1978b, 20). The reason for this is\nattributed to Morgenbesser: \u201cWe cannot say what the world would\nbe like without numbers, because describing any thinkable experience\n(except for utter emptiness) presupposes their existence\u201d\n(1978b, 19\u201320). The point seems to be that we must be able to\ncompare mathematical and non-mathematical explanations of some target\nin order to get an explanatory argument going. But if the target\nalways \u201cpresupposes\u201d the existence of some mathematical\nentities, then this comparison is not possible. Bangu has developed\nthis point by noting how many of the cases discussed have targets that\nare mathematical in character, as with the prime periods of the\ncicadas (Bangu 2008, 2012, see Baker 2021a for a response). So, the\nworry continues, mathematical explanations are only indispensable in\nscience if we have used mathematical entities to characterize the\ntarget phenomena. Pincock has a somewhat similar concern: if the\ntargets are characterized in weak mathematical terms, then only weak\nmathematical theories will be needed to explain these targets, and\nthese theories can be easily supplied with a nominalistic\ninterpretation that preserves these theories\u2019 explanatory power\n(Pincock 2012, see Baker 2015b for a reply to these worries).\n\nAnother worry accepts that there are in some sense mathematical\nexplanations in science. However, premise 2\u2032 is rejected because\nthese explanations fail to involve the existence of any mathematical\nobjects. Saatsi has developed this criticism by claiming that\nmathematics only explains by representing some non-mathematical\nfeatures of the physical world (Saatsi 2007, 2011). On this reading,\npremise 2\u2032 requires the existence of some\n\u201cdistinctively\u201d or \u201cgenuinely\u201d mathematical\nexplanations, but there are no such explanations. As Saatsi puts the\nworry, \u201cwhat really matters for the indispensability argument\n\u2013 all that matters! \u2013 is whether or not mathematics plays\nthe kind of explanatory role that we should take as ontologically\ncommitting\u201d (Saatsi 2016, 1051). Until the defenders of the\nargument clarify what distinctively mathematical explanations are and\nhow they involve mathematical objects, it seems that premise 2\u2032\nis in trouble. Other versions of this objection may be found in Daly\n& Langford 2009, Rizza 2011, Tallant 2013, Liggins 2016, Busch\n& Morrison 2016, Barrantes 2019 and Boyce 2021 (see also Panza\n& Sereni 2016 for a helpful overview of these debates).\n\nA third kind of worry about premise 2\u2032 is developed by\nmathematical fictionalists like Yablo and Leng (Leng 2010, 2021, Yablo\n2012, 2020). Fictionalists accept the existence of distinctively\nmathematical explanations and yet argue that these explanations do not\npresuppose the existence of any mathematical objects. For example,\nLeng argues that \u201cwe can generate mathematical explanations of\nphysical phenomena that do not appeal to any abstract mathematical\nobjects, but instead only require modal truths about what follows\nlogically from our mathematical assumptions, together with the\nrecognition that the assumptions of our mathematical theories are true\nwhen interpreted as about the physical system under examination\u201d\n(Leng 2021, 10437). Leng can thus endorse the very same unified\nderivation of the features of Baker\u2019s cicadas, and yet refrain\nfrom accepting the existence of mathematical objects. While Saatsi\ntakes the physical features of the system to be the genuine\nexplainers, Leng uses those same features to interpret the\nmathematical theories that are doing the explanatory work. Either way,\npremise 2\u2032 of the indispensability argument comes out false.\n\nColyvan and Baker\u2019s strategy for supporting premise 2\u2032 has\nlargely involved cases where it appears that mathematical objects play\na role in the explanation that is analogous to what unobservable\nentities like electrons play in other explanations. For example, in\nthe cicada case, the prime numbers afford a unified derivation of the\ntarget of the explanation. This strategy would be most effective\nagainst representational approaches to mathematical explanation. The\nbasic idea is that scientists value these explanations, and so any\nreinterpretation of them in non-mathematical terms risks privileging\nan unmotivated philosophical theory over some legitimate scientific\npractice. As Baker and Colyvan put the point in a reply directed at\nDaly and Langford (2009): \u201cCommitments to philosophical theories\nsuch as nominalism, a causal theory of explanation, or the\n\u2018indexing\u2019 view of mathematical applications are not good\nreasons for rejecting well-supported scientific and mathematical\nclaims\u201d (Baker & Colyvan 2011, 332).\n\nA second strategy that Colyvan has pursued is to challenge critics to\nrecast these explanations in non-mathematical terms. The refusal to do\nthis involves an \u201ceasy road\u201d to nominalism that Colyvan\nthinks is untenable: \u201cwhen some piece of language is delivering\nan explanation, either that piece of language must be interpreted\nliterally or the non-literal reading of the language in question\nstands proxy for the real explanation\u201d (Colyvan 2010, 300). This\nstrategy is most effective against fictionalists. It involves a\nconception of scientific explanation that requires that every genuine\nexplanation be presentable in literal, non-metaphorical language: to\nsay why something is the case, we must literally say what is\nresponsible for what, and so it must be in principle possible to avoid\nfictional or metaphorical tools. If fictionalists are right about pure\nmathematics, then mathematics is simply such a tool, and so they\nshould be able to sketch a non-mathematical version of the\nexplanations at issue. The fictionalist response is to deny this\nconception of explanation.\n\nYet another kind of criticism of premise 2\u2032 accepts both the\nexistence of mathematical explanations and that these explanations\ninvolve mathematical objects, but maintains that these explanations\nare dispensable from our best science. That is, either the best\nregimentation of our scientific theories will avoid quantification\nover mathematical objects or no appeal to IBE will actually support\nadopting such an explanation. This sort of criticism can be traced\nback to Field\u2019s pioneering Science without numbers\n(Field 1980). There Field contrasts \u201cintrinsic\u201d\nexplanations with \u201cextrinsic\u201d explanations. He claims that\nall mathematical explanations are extrinsic and that for every\nextrinsic explanation of some target, there is a superior, intrinsic\nexplanation of that very target (Field 1980, 43\u201344; see Marcus\n2013). The explanations championed by Colyvan, Baker and others\nsuggest that it is not clear that a mathematical explanation is always\nextrinsic or that a non-mathematical explanation that is intrinsic is\nsuperior in all respects. Consider again the non-causal explanation of\nthe impossibility of traversing the bridges of K\u00f6nigsberg or the\nevolutionary explanation of the prime periods of the cicada. While\nsome non-mathematical derivation of these targets is surely available,\nthis does not settle whether or not these derivations should count as\nexplanations or what their explanatory virtues might be.\n\nPerhaps the most promising defense of premise 2\u2032 would be to\nprovide a positive account of distinctively mathematical explanations\nthat would clarify how endorsing such explanations commits one to the\nexistence of some mathematical objects. The recent literature on this\nissue again seems to lead to a kind of standoff. Consider, for\nexample, Baron\u2019s \u201cPythagorean\u201d proposal for these\nexplanations (Baron forthcoming). Baron defines a Pythagorean to be\nsomeone who not only believes in mathematical objects as abstract\nentities, but who claims that some of the intrinsic properties of\nthese abstract entities are also possessed by concrete entities. This\nis possible because the salient intrinsic properties of the\nmathematical entities are structural properties that are found in the\nconcrete world whenever the concrete entities are arranged in the\nright structure. These shared, structural properties and their\nnecessary mathematical relations thus enable mathematical truths to\nexplain features of physical systems such as the bridges or cicadas.\nIn addition, Baron is clear that \u201cStructural properties on my\naccount make indispensable reference to abstract objects\u201d (Baron\nforthcoming, 25). So one defense of premise 2\u2032 involves adopting\nBaron\u2019s Pythagoreanism.\n\nOther accounts of distinctively mathematical explanation support the\nrejection of premise 2\u2032. For example, Lange\u2019s modal\ninterpretation of distinctively mathematical explanations leads him to\nendorse what he calls an \u201cAristotelian realist\u201d\ninterpretation of pure mathematics in terms of a special kind of\nabstract property, without the recourse to any abstract objects (Lange\n2021b, see also Franklin 2008). According to Lange, the best way to\nmake sense of the explanatory power of mathematical truths is to\nsuppose that \u201cmathematics concerns mathematical properties\npossessed by physical systems\u201d (Lange 2021b, 50). As with Baron,\nthese mathematical properties can help to explain why these physical\nsystems have some other properties. For Lange the main benefit of such\nan Aristotelian interpretation is that the salient modal features of\nthe physical systems arise from the presence of the mathematical\nproperties. This helps to clarify in what sense the mathematical truth\nand the properties it invokes may be explanatorily prior to some\ntarget property. Crucially, though, for Lange this interpretation of\npure mathematics eliminates the need to invoke abstract objects. If\nLange is right, then, premise 2\u2032 of the explanatory\nindispensability argument is false. (See also Knowles & Saatsi\n2021, Knowles 2021a, Knowles 2021b and Baker 2022 on additional\nchallenges to this premise.)\n\nOne diagnosis of the problems with indispensability arguments is that\nthe conclusion of the argument concerns the interpretation of pure\nmathematics while the premises of the argument consider how\nmathematics is used in science. Perhaps, then, a platonist would be\nbetter served by focusing on explanatory considerations that arise\nwithin the practice of pure mathematics. This is the focus of section\n2.\n",
