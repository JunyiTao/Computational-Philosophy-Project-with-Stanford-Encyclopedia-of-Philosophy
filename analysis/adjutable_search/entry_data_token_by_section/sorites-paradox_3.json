    "main_text": "Responses to the Paradox || Ideal Language Approaches\n3.1 Ideal Language Approaches\n\nCommitted as Frege and Russell (see entries on\n Gottlob Frege\n and\n Bertrand Russell)\n were to ideal language doctrines, it is not surprising to find them\npursuing a type (1) response (e.g., Frege 1903[1960], Russell 1923). A\nkey attribute of the ideal language is said to be its precision; hence\nthe vagueness of natural language, including all soritical terms, is a\ndefect to be eliminated. If that\u2019s right, then contrary to what\nmany theorists believe, soritical terms cannot be marshalled to\nchallenge classical logic. Logic simply does not apply to them.\nEchoing this response, Quine contends that although eliminating vague\nterms may incur some cost to ordinary ways of talking, it\u2019s a\ncost worth paying insofar as it allows us to preserve the \u201csweet\nsimplicity\u201d of classical logic (1981: 31\u201337).\n\nHowever, with the demise of ideal language doctrines and subsequent\nrevival of interest in ordinary language, vagueness was no longer\nregarded as a superficial or easily dispensable feature. If logic was\nto have teeth, it had to apply to natural language as it stands;\nsoritical expressions are unavoidable and the paradox must be faced\nhead on. Responses of type (2) do just this and are the most common\nfamily of responses. Logic is seen as applicable to natural language,\nin particular to the paradoxical argument, and the latter is diagnosed\nas resting on a faulty premise. \n",
