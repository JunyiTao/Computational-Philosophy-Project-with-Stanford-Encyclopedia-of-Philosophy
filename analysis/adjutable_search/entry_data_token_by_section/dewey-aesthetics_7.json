    "main_text": "Art as Experience || Culture and Art\u2019s Significance\n2.6 Culture and Art\u2019s Significance\n\nDewey\u2019s take on culture also shows the moderate character of his\naesthetic naturalism. He does not consider culture an illusory or in\nsome other way irreal phenomenon, something that should be explained\naway by reducing it to natural reality. Dewey even finds it\nunfortunate how often the term \u201cnaturalism\u201d has been\nwrongly thought \u201cto signify a disregard of all values that\ncannot be reduced to the physical and animal\u201d (AE:\n156). In contrast, Dewey believes that humans are both natural and\ncultural creatures through and through and that the real challenge is\nto investigate how these two ineliminable sides of human life, nature\nand culture, are intertwined. Dewey, in fact, became so interested in\nthis issue that he even had plans of naming his late philosophy\n\u201ccultural naturalism\u201d (Alexander 2013).\n\nDewey explains culture as a form of \u201cemergence\u201d, that is,\nculture is something that in time emerges from nature. In other words,\n\n\n\nculture is the product not of efforts of men put forth in a void or\njust upon themselves, but of prolonged and cumulative interaction with\nenvironment. (AE: 34\u201335) \n\n\nNature and culture are two different layers of human life. The two key\nconcepts in this instance are rhythm and ritual. Rhythm is for Dewey a\nfundamental feature of the world, whose existence in nature predates\n\u201cpoetry, painting, architecture and music\u201d (AE:\n147). He, again, refers to such rhythmic processes in nature as\n\u201cdawn and sunset, day and night, rain and sunshine\u201d,\n\u201cthe circular course of the seasons\u201d, \u201cthe\never-recurring cycles of growth\u201d, and \u201cthe never-ceasing\nround of births and deaths\u201d, which he believes created a\nrhythmic space for human experience already from its very dawn. Dewey\nargues further that new layers emerged into human existence once\nhumans no longer merely observed the rhythmic changes of nature but\nstarted to participate in them in the form of rituals and other\ncommunal gatherings. Humans came to use the rhythms of nature to\ncelebrate their relationship with nature and to commemorate their most\nintense experiences. Dewey writes: \n\n\nExperiences of war, of hunt, of sowing and reaping, of the death and\nresurrection of vegetation, of stars circling over watchful shepherds,\nof constant return of the inconstant moon, were undergone to be\nreproduced in pantomime and generated the sense of life as drama.\n(AE: 153)\n\n\nWith these rituals Dewey believes humans\u2019 relationship to the\nsurrounding world rose to a level where they started to reflect on\ntheir place in the order of things more intently. And the rituals\nformed in response to the cycles of nature started to embody the\nworldviews and values of the human groups that they gathered together.\nThe rituals created a sense of community with one\u2019s immediate\nfellows, as well as a sense of continuity of past generations, thereby\nwidening and enriching \u201cthe designs of living\u201d\n(AE: 29). In Dewey\u2019s view, these rituals were\n\u201cesthetic\u201d, but they were \u201calso more than\nesthetic\u201d, for \n\n\neach of these communal modes of activity united the practical, the\nsocial, and the educative in an integrated whole having esthetic form.\n(AE: 330\u2013331) \n\n\nCulture is, then, for Dewey something \u201csituated\u201d as well\nas \u201csituating\u201d (Alexander 2013: 13).\n\nAn important value that Dewey sees in art is related to these communal\nsides of experience. Although Dewey believes each culture is held\ntogether by its own individuality, it is still possible to create\ncontinuity and community between cultures by expanding experience to\nabsorb the attitudes and values of other cultures. In the end, Dewey\nregards works of art as \n\n\nthe only media of complete and unhindered communication between man\nand man that can occur in a world full of gulfs and walls that limit\ncommunity of experience. (AE: 110) \n\n\nFor example, \n\n\nbarriers are dissolved, limiting prejudices melt away, when we enter\ninto the spirit of Negro and Polynesian art. (AE: 337) \n\n\nAs a result of such engagements we start to \u201clearn to\nhear\u201d with someone else\u2019s \u201cears\u201d and\n\u201csee\u201d with someone else\u2019s \u201ceyes\u201d. Works\nof art are, then, for Dewey \u201cthe most intimate and energetic\nmeans of aiding individuals to share in the arts of living\u201d\n(AE: 339).\n\nThere has been considerable discussion in aesthetics whether art has\nintrinsic value or whether its value is dependent on some external\ngoal it helps to fulfill. Dewey rejects the dichotomy, because he\nthinks talk of art\u2019s utilitarian aspects tends to involve a too\nnarrow conception of utility. The utility of an artwork is different\nin kind from the utility of an umbrella or a mower. While these and\nsimilar utilitarian objects serve \u201ca particular and limited\nend\u201d, an artwork \u201cserves life\u201d, for example by\ncarrying us to \u201ca refreshed attitude toward the circumstances\nand exigencies of ordinary experience\u201d (AE: 140, 144).\nArtworks can serve life through their evocative function; they can\nraise experiences that educate us. Dewey also emphasizes how the work\nof the artwork does not end at the close of the immediate experience,\nbut \u201ccontinues to operate in indirect channels\u201d\n(AE: 144).\n\nLike all important experiences, our engagements with artworks can also\nlead to what Philip Jackson calls \u201cexperiential growth\u201d\n(Jackson 1998: 111). Here Jackson follows Dewey\u2019s notion of\ngrowth, which is central to his philosophy of education. The idea of\ngrowth is also related to Dewey\u2019s naturalist underpinnings; when\nthe organism overcomes some problematic situation, there is at least\nsome minimal degree of growth. The organism learns something and can\nuse the experience in new circumstances in the future. Growth, in\nother words is, for Dewey, \n\n\nessentially the ability to learn from experience; the power to retain\nfrom one experience something which is of avail in coping with the\ndifficulties of a later situation. (DE: 49) \n\n\nThrough the different types of experiences artworks can evoke, art too\ncan be an important source of this sort of growth. This is why Dewey\nthinks we should feel a similar type of respect toward \u201cthe\ncreators\u201d of perceptive artworks as we do toward \u201cthe\ninventors of microscopes and microphones\u201d; in both cases we are\ndealing with artefacts, which can train us in new modes of perception\nand \u201copen new objects to be observed and enjoyed\u201d\n(EN: 293).\n",
