Combating conceptual conservativism: Paul Feyerabend on incommensurability\n\nAn examination of Feyerabend\u2019s use and development of the idea\nof incommensurability of scientific theories reveals just how\nwidespread it was prior to 1962. It also reveals the veiled common\ncore of Feyerabend\u2019s philosophy of science, which otherwise\nappears to be a series of critical papers on unrelated topics\n(Oberheim 2005, 2006). That common core is the use of the idea of\nincommensurability to challenge many different forms of conceptual\nconservativism in science and philosophy. Conceptual conservativism\nunjustly favors existing ideas over potential improvements offered by\nincommensurable alternatives. Feyerabend used the notion of\nincommensurability to attack the following forms of conceptual\nconservativism: Heisenberg\u2019s idea of closed theories (1951),\nattempts to distinguish philosophical accounts of ontology from\nphysics (1954), the foundational role of the stability thesis in\nlogical positivism (1951, 1958a), Bohr\u2019s principle of\ncomplementarity (1958b, 1961, 1962, 1965b, 1970a), and the logical\nempiricists\u2019 models of explanation and reduction (1962, 1963a).\nHe also used the idea of incommensurability to attack forms of\nconceptual conservativism implicit in the models of theory testing\npromoted by classical empiricists, the logical positivists, the\nlogical empiricists, Popper, and Kuhn (1958a, 1962, 1963a, 1965b,\n1970a), Kantian transcendental necessities (1962, 1965b, 1965c),\ntraditional philosophical conundrums like the problem of the existence\nof the external world, the problem of the existence of other minds,\nand especially the mind-body problem (1962, 1965b, 1967, 1969a),\ncertain aspects of Wittgenstein\u2019s later philosophy, as well as\nthe linguistic philosophical movement that takes the utility of\neveryday concepts as given and merely attempts to analyze them,\nwithout changing their meanings (or \u2018arguments from\nsynonymy\u2019) (1962, 1963a, 1965b, 1969b, 1970a), Popper\u2019s\nconception of verisimilitude (1970b), and scientific realist\ncharacterizations of scientific knowledge and scientific advance\n(1970b). Feyerabend argued that all of these views cannot accommodate\nthe fact that the history of science reveals revolutionary\ndevelopments in which incommensurable alternatives replaced existing\nideas in the course of progress.\n",
