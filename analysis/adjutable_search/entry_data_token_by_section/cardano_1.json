    "main_text": "Life, Knowledge, and Nature\n2. Life, Knowledge, and Nature\n\nCardano\u2019s cosmological views belong to a long-established system\nof astro-biological doctrines whose origins go back to Aristotelian\nphysics, Hippocratic vitalism, and fundamental assumptions underlying\nthe tradition of astrological and meteorological learning, reshaped\nthrough a series of Hebrew and Arabic mediations. His account of the\nsupralunary world combines elements from Neoplatonic philosophy and\nChristian theology. In line with many of his contemporaries, Cardano\nmaintains that there is a clear division between the supralunary and\nsublunary world. The life of the universe is the result of varying\ndegrees of celestial energy overflowing from the One, i.e., God. From\nGod to matter, cohorts of the most disparate souls mediate between\nthese two extremes. From a material point of view, the connective\nelement between heaven and earth is celestial heat. The principal\nconstituents of the sublunary world are matter (earth, water and air),\ncelestial heat, and a wide variety of souls (spanning from demonic\nminds to substantial forms understood as specific principles of\nlife).\n\nIn line with the principles of Greek ontology (and showing an evident\ninterest in the Renaissance recovery of Parmenides\u2019 philosophy),\nCardano maintains that nothing comes out of nothing; rather, all\nthings derive from something, and this something cannot be infinite\n(Hyperchen, OO, I, 284b; De natura, OO, II, 284a).\nAristotle called this something \u201chyle or prime matter,\u201d\nbut Cardano prefers to discard this notion of an intermediate entity\nbetween being and non being, replacing it with the view of the\nelements (earth, water and air) as the material starting point and\ncelestial heat as the efficient active principle, \u201cfor otherwise\nthe elements would be completely redundant if there were prime\nmatter\u201d (De natura, OO, II, 284b). The elements, which\nrepresent the first level of organization in matter, are three (and\nnot four as demanded by Aristotelian and scholastic physics): earth,\nwater and air (De arcanis aeternitatis, OO, X, 9a). As for\nfire, Cardano considers this to be a product of celestial heat, which\nis one of the various streams of vital energy flowing from the\nsupralunary sources of life and knowledge and which pervade the\nuniverse as one living organism. Innate heat of a celestial origin is\nthe active element that mediates between the state of utter immobility\nwhich characterizes intelligible substances and the incessant mobility\nthat defines the life of material beings. Through an exercise in\nintrospective analysis, Cardano enumerates three principles that\nregulate both our inner life and the life of all created things: one\n\u201cis moved and does not move, resulting from the heavy\nelements;\u201d another \u201cmoves, and it is not moved, that is,\nthe soul;\u201d the third, finally, \u201cis moved by the\nsoul\u201d and moves the body, i.e., the innate heat\n(Theonoston, OO, II, 304b). To the question of whether the\nsoul can be identified with celestial heat, Cardano replies that,\nunlike the latter, the former is incorporeal, does not occupy any\nplace and therefore is never in motion. Also, that which is in motion\ndoes not have that level of self-stability that is necessary for a\nbeing to be able to perceive (sentire) or to think\n(intelligere) (Theonoston, OO, II, 304b).\n\nIn Cardano\u2019s metaphysics, matter and form are complementary, in\nthat in nature there cannot be matter without form, and forms are\nalways with a body. Forms represent the primordial stage in the\nprocess through which the created universe becomes one living being.\nThe difference between souls and forms is that souls, albeit involved\nin the animation of bodies, remain nevertheless unaffected by\ncorporeal reality. Up on a higher level, minds are souls that are\ncompletely independent of matter, bodies and motion. However, even\nwithin the ontological sphere of the minds, there are varying degrees\nof embodiment. While the highest celestial intelligences are wholly\nseparated from the material cosmos, demonic substances, albeit\nincorporeal, can affect the corporeal world through forces\n(vires) and influences (influxus) of various kind.\nOne of these is \u201cthat force which is connected to demons,\nregardless of whether this power is corporeal and depends on humours,\nor it is incorporeal.\u201d Cardano maintains that it is through\nforces of this nature that \u201cthe parts of the universe are\naroused by demons, stars or some other hidden cause\u201d\n(Paralipomena, in OO, X, 446b\u2013447a. See also De\nsubtilitate, OO, III, 670a). The principle that in a way collects\nand administers all these currents of celestial energy is the soul of\nthe world (anima mundi). In Cardano\u2019s system of\nastro-biological determinism, the universal soul keeps the whole\ncosmos together and performs paramount operations in accordance with\nthe original plan devised by God and implemented by the planetary\nintelligences, for \u201call things are influenced by the higher\nheaven and are moved at the command of the soul of the world.\u201d\nThe soul of the world, which \u201ccannot be understood without\nGod,\u201d directs the work of nature, and, \u201cin the process of\ngenerating things, produces supercelestial lives and\nmultiplicity\u201d (De arcanis aeternitatis, OO, X, 6a). In\nthe sublunary world, the major operations of life and generation are\nperformed by nature, understood as a source of teleological activity\nsupervised by the intellect and the soul of the world (De\nsubtilitate, OO, III, 360a; ed. Nenci, 63). The complex\nrelationship between soul and nature, and the role played by celestial\nforces, is a crucial point in Cardano\u2019s philosophy (On\nCardano\u2019s cosmological views, see Ingegno 1980, 1\u201378,\n209\u2013271; Maclean 1984; Grafton 1999).\n\nRegarding the hierarchical arrangement of the ontological principles,\nthere is a certain oscillation in the way Cardano distributes them\nalong the various degrees of being, but by and large we can say that\nGod understood as the One represents the ultimate source of order and\nactivity in the universe, and all the rest emanates from it in the\nform of increasingly more plural and less integrated entities, from\nintellects to souls, from the soul of the world to individual souls,\nfrom the soul to nature, from celestial to earthly animals, from forms\nto scattered matter. In De arcanis aeternitatis, Cardano\nlists fourteen genera of beings, a number that, in his opinion,\n\u201cmatches the structure of the universe:\u201d three elements\n(earth, water, air), celestial heat, stones, plants, living creatures\ngenerated from putrescent matter (animantia ex putredine),\nquadrupeds, birds, fish, reptiles, human beings, demons, and God\n(De arcanis aeternitatis, OO, X, 8b).\n\nHigher animals are divided into four main classes: quadrupeds, birds,\nfish and reptiles. In the diagram he attaches to his discussion,\n\u201cthe nature of the animals is connected to the human one only in\none point,\u201d which is located in the area corresponding to the\nquadrupeds. See Figure 1:\n\n\n\nFigure 1.\n\n\nHowever, the margin of interaction between human beings and the rest\nof living creatures is ampler. In keeping with a number of Renaissance\nphilosophers, Cardano maintains that man is at the centre of micro-\nand macro-cosmic exchanges within the universe: \u201csince the human\ncircle corresponds to each single part of the whole domain of living\nbeings, all the properties and natures that can be found in living\nbeings will also be present in human beings\u201d (De arcanis\naeternitatis, OO, X, 8a). In Paralipomena, Cardano\ndefines the human species as an amalgam of forms (tota humana\nspecies congeries quaedam est), a \u201cmass\u201d that is in\nconstant evolution (succrescitat que decrescit):\n\nthis excellent human matter conceals the forms of all animals: the\nforms of the ox (although they do not feed on hay); of the snake (but\nthey do not kill with their bite); of the lion (but they have no\nclaw). By all means, the characteristics of the soul are exactly the\nsame (perhaps even worse); however, since these animal forms\n[concealed in the human nature] lack their corresponding bodily\norgans, they do not really seem to be the same (Paralipomena,\nOO, X, 446a).\n\n\nHuman nature includes all the forms of nonhuman nature, but they lie\ndormant, as it were, in a state of virtual energy. Cardano always pays\nspecial attention to those aspects of human nature that seem to\nindicate a close link with animals and lower forms of life.\nUnsurprisingly, comparative analyses between humans and animals abound\nin his works. Among the questions dealing with the relationships\nbetween human and nonhuman animals, Cardano is particularly interested\nin exploring whether reason is an exclusive prerogative of human\nbeings or it should rather be seen as the result of biological\ndevelopment (De natura, OO, II, 283b\u2013284a).\n\nAbove nonhuman and human animals, Cardano posits a universe teeming\nwith the most diverse kinds of incorporeal minds. He acknowledges that\nto count the number of celestial substances populating the supralunary\nworld would go way beyond the power of reason; and yet Denis the\nPseudo-Areopagite, \u201crelying on Platonic arguments and the\nvisions of St Paul\u201d divided them into nine orders. Within these\norders Cardano identifies \u201cseven natures.\u201d The first\nnature is the \u201cthe infinite, or God,\u201d eternal in itself.\nThe second nature is \u201cthe soul of all things or lives,\u201d\nwhich represents the first breaking up of the original unity; then\ncomes the already mentioned soul of the world, whose loss of\nontological unity and independence begins to manifest itself, being\n\u201cone principle resulting out of many and eternal ones because of\nsomething else\u2019s intervention.\u201d The fourth nature is the\nsoul which moves the universe, the primum movens, not eternal\nin itself, but through eternal temporal succession. The fifth nature,\nthe souls of the various planets, derives from the combined action of\nthis primary mover and the soul of the world. Various orders of souls\nemanates from the fifth nature: \u201cheroic\u201d souls, minds that\nare capable of having sense perceptions (mentes sensiles) and\nthe soul that presides over all sentient lives (communis\nsensilis). This last type of soul divides itself not only into\nindividual beings, but also into parts, \u201cfor everything is\nalive.\u201d The next nature, therefore, the sixth one \u2013 the\n\u201ccommon and vital soul\u201d (anima communis atque\nvitalis) \u2013 belongs to plants, lower animals and the\nelements. The last order is \u201cthe soul conceived in\nmatter,\u201d which \u201cPlato called idea,\u201d and Cardano\nsimply characterizes as \u201clife.\u201d Relying on later Platonic\nauthors, from Iamblichus to Denis the Pseudo-Areopagite, Cardano\ndescribes the universe as one single entity, seamlessly interrelated\nthroughout its vital expanse, placed between the two extremes of God,\nabsolute eternity and unity, and matter, the domain of absolute\ntransience and multiplicity (De arcanis aeternitatis, OO, X,\n6ab).\n",
