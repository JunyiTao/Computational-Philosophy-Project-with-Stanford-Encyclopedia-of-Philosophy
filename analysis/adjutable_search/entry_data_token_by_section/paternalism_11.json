    "main_text": "Libertarian Paternalism || Transparency\n4.3 Transparency\n\nOne issue with many nudges is what the person being nudged knows about\nthe nudge. In the Cafeteria example the students are aware that food\nhas been placed at different levels of eyesight. In that sense the\nnudge is transparent to them. It is not like subliminal messaging in\nwhich they are not aware of messages directed to them. Let us call\nnudges which are transparent in this sense narrow nudges.\n\nFor an example of a nudge that is not even narrowly transparent\nconsider the experiment where, in order to increase office\nworker\u2019s payments for the coffee they take from the coffee\nmachine a painting of a pair of eyes is hung above the coffee pot.\nThis did increase the rate of payment. Most workers questioned about\nthe painting either had not noticed it at all or made no connection\nwith the issue of payment.\n\nIn the cafeteria example while aware that the food is on different\nlevels the students are not aware that the placing of the food has\nbeen done in order to promote a certain end\u2014eating more healthy\nfoods. The placement of the food is not random, nor motivated by\naesthetic considerations. It is deliberate and motivated by a\nparticular set of considerations. Some nudges are more transparent in\nthe sense that it is obvious they have been deliberately introduced\nand their motivation is also clear. For example, the warnings on\ncigarette packages that smoking is dangerous to one\u2019s health.\nCall these broad nudges.\n\nThere is some evidence that making nudges broad does not interfere\nwith their efficacy. A recent study in the context of end-of-life care\nshowed the effect of a default is not weakened when people are told\nthat a default was chosen because it is usually effective (Lowenstein\net al. 2014).\n\nNote that there could be an even more transparent feature of\nnudges\u2014call them very broad nudges. This would be when the\nmechanism by which the nudge influences is made public as well.\nSuppose we presented an opt-out set up and said (1) we are doing this\nto increase participation in the retirement program, and (2) if this\nis effective it is because people have a tendency to stick with the\nstatus-quo.\n\nNudges which are neither narrow nor broad\u2014such as subliminal\nmessages to movie-goers to buy fruit instead of popcorn\u2014might be\nan effective way of encouraging consumption of healthier food. But\nthey seem to have a morally dubious character. Even if the facts are\nthat such messages have rather weak efficacy we object to their\nby-passing any possibility to avoid or resist them.\n\nSunstein has put forward what he calls a transparency condition:\n\n\nChoice architecture should be transparent and subject to public\nscrutiny, certainly if public officials are responsible for it. At a\nminimum, this proposition means that when such officials institute\nsome kind of reform, they should not hide it from the public\u2026If\nofficials alter a default rule so as to promote clean energy or\nconservation, they should disclose what they are doing. (2015: 19)\n\n\n\nThis formulation leaves open a number of issues. Are\n\u201ctransparent\u201d and \u201csubject to public scrutiny\u201d\ndifferent conditions? The \u201cminimum\u201d interpretation is only\na condition of publicity about what officials are doing. The\ngovernment could announce in advance that they are going to use\nsubliminal messages on television programs to promote health. Sunstein\nbelieves that this would satisfy his transparency condition but that\nit might be objectionable on grounds of manipulation.\n\nIt remains open for discussion how to formulate a norm which is closer\nto the intuitive idea of transparency, to distinguish various sense of\ntransparency\u2014such as narrow and broad\u2014and to debate\nwhether such transparency is a necessary component of legitimate\nnudges. Must, for example, the public utility which hopes to encourage\nenergy conservation preface its informational message about the\naverage consumption of your neighbors with the fact that they are\nsending this information because they think it will encourage\nconservation? Does it have to disclose they believe it may do so\nbecause people have a tendency to conform to what their neighbors are\ndoing?\n\nWhy is transparency required? One possible objection to\nnon-transparency is that it interferes with the autonomy of those\ninfluenced. It seems too strong to think that this is true of all\nnon-transparent nudges but a more limited claim is that a nudge limits\nautonomy when it influences an agent\u2019s choices and were she\naware of the nudge she would reject the influence and the influence\nwould no longer be effective in her choices.\n\nAnother issue concerning autonomy is whether it is affected by both\nintentional and unintentional nudges. If the cafeteria manager places\nthe food at random she will still be influencing people\u2019s\nchoices. Are the choices more autonomous in this case than in a case\nin which the food is placed in exactly the same way but deliberately\nin order to affect the choices?\n",
