    "main_text": "Detecting Drift Empirically || Recent Empirical Issues Concerning Drift\n4.3 Recent Empirical Issues Concerning Drift\n\nHayley Clatterbuck, Elliott Sober, and Richard Lewontin (2013) argue\nthat it doesn\u2019t make sense to talk of drift\n\u201cdominating\u201d selection or being \u201cstronger\nthan\u201d selection. (Among many such claims, this would challenge\nDietrich and Millstein\u2019s (2008) claim, discussed in the previous\nsection, that the best way to understand the nearly neutral theory is\nas weak selection dominated by drift). Clatterbuck, Sober, and\nLewontin take selection and drift to be a population-level process or\nprocesses (they don\u2019t take a stand on whether there is a one\nprocess or two, but they are clearly \u201ccausalists\u201d rather\nthan \u201cstatisticalists\u201d), but they raise concerns for the\nway that biologists have understood the value \\(Ns\\), which is the\neffective size of the population multiplied by the selection\ncoefficient. After some initial controversies over how to interpret\nthis value, most biologists eventually came to the view that\n\n\nselection \u201cdominates\u201d drift when \\(Ns\\) is much greater\nthan some specified number and that drift \u201cdominates\u201d\nselection when \\(Ns\\) is much less than that number,\n\n\nwith proposed numbers including 1/4, 1/2, and 1; in between values are\nthought to be where the two causes are more or less equal\n(Clatterbuck, Sober, and Lewontin 2013). Clatterbuck, Sober, and\nLewontin point out that on the standard picture, the values of\nN and s do not predict one gene frequency outcome;\nrather, they predict a probability distribution of possible gene\nfrequency outcomes. But, they argue, you can change this distribution\nby changing N or by changing s, with values\n\u201cchosen so that the first change makes more of a difference, or\nless, or the same, as you please\u201d; thus, it is \u201carbitrary\nto focus on comparisons that give drift the upper hand, or that do the\nsame for selection\u201d (Clatterbuck, Sober, and Lewontin 2013:\n538). Here, the suggestion seems to be that N represents the\ndrift cause and that s represents the selection\ncause\u2014although it\u2019s not clear why drift-as-cause should be\nequated with population-size-as-a-cause\u2014with the conclusion that\nthe causes are not separable. To say that they are separable would,\nClatterbuck, Sober, and Lewontin say, would be akin to asking whether\nthe result of four heads of a fair coin tossed ten times is due to the\nfairness of the coin or the number of tosses. They also suggest that\nit is impossible to have a population that is not undergoing drift,\nsince even in an infinite population there could be deviation from\nselective expectations (again, making it hard to separate the causes).\nFinally, they argue that it doesn\u2019t make sense to say that with\nidentical setups that producing differing outcomes, that selection\ndominates in some (when the favored allele increases in frequency) and\ndrift in others (when the favored allele decreases in frequency).\n\nRobert Brandon and Lenore Fleming (2014) point out, however, that\nClatterbuck, Sober, and Lewontin\u2019s analysis of a seemingly\nempirical question is not based on an empirical discovery, but rather,\na conceptual analysis, and that as a conceptual analysis, it is not\nfully consistent; that is, they do not consistently treat drift as a\ncausal process, but sometimes treat it as an outcome (as in the last\npoint described in the previous paragraph). Brandon and Fleming cite\nseveral recent empirical studies where biologists seek to provide\nevidence that drift dominates selection, not relying on the simple\n\\(Ns\\) to come to that conclusion, and point out that there are other\nmethods for testing the relative strengths of drift and selection,\nsuch as the McDonald-Kreitman (MK) test. In Brandon and\nFleming\u2019s view, \u201cdrift is not a process. It is, however, a\npredictable result of a process, namely probabilistic sampling\u201d\n(2014: 581). It is somewhat unclear, however, how on their view the\ndrift outcome (which outcome?) is \u201cswamping\u201d or\n\u201coverriding\u201d the selective outcome (presumably by the\noutcome being the cause of some further, as yet unidentified,\noutcome). Further elaboration on this point would be useful.\n\nIt has also been suggested, most notably by John Gillespie (2000a,b,\n2001), that many purported instances of genetic drift are in fact due\nto \u201cgenetic draft.\u201d Genetic draft is a process of linked\nselection (a hitchhiking process) where it is a matter of chance which\nof two neutral alleles (in a two-locus model) happens to be linked to\na site that undergoes an advantageous mutation, and where the timing\nof these mutations, followed by a rapid selective \u201csweep\u201d\nto fixation, is random. As Skipper (2006) discusses, one of the\ninteresting properties of genetic draft is that it can produce an\noutcome similar to that which one would expect from genetic drift in\nsmall populations, namely, a reduction in genetic variation (thus the\nsimilar name). Gillespie argues that draft is less sensitive to\npopulation size than drift, which leads him to claim that draft is a\nmore significant cause of evolution than drift (Skipper 2006). Thus,\ndraft introduces yet another relative significance debate (Beatty\n1995, 1997) to add to the others discussed in this article: drift vs.\nselection, Wright\u2019s SBT vs. Fisher\u2019s mass selection,\nneutralist vs. nearly neutralist vs. selectionist molecular evolution.\nHowever, it is worth noting that while draft can produce one of the\nsame outcomes that drift can (reduction in heterozygosity), it would\nnot give rise to fluctuating gene frequencies from one generation to\nthe next. So, not all drifty outcomes can be accounted for by\ndraft.\n\nWilliam Provine (2014) has taken the reduction of drift\u2019s role a\nstep further, calling random genetic drift a \u201cfallacy\u201d and\narguing that no such phenomenon exists in nature, period. Provine\nnotes that for both Fisher and Wright (and even Kimura), drift was\ndeeply intertwined with inbreeding, to the extent that one was\nsometimes confused for the other, which seems warranted\u2014or, at\nleast, that the relationship between the two was never fully clarified\n(see, e.g., Wright 1931a). Provine defines random drift as\n\u201cfortuitous extinction of genes\u201d at a genic locus on a\nchromosome. According to Provine,\n\n\nWright believed that random sampling of gametes in Mendelism produced\n\u201crandom genetic drift\u201d at every locus [on every\nchromosome] in small populations, and also that inbreeding led to\nrampant \u201crandom genetic drift\u201d in small populations\n(Provine 2014: 54).\n\n\nHere, Provine treats drift as an outcome, and as that outcome seems\nphysically unlikely or even impossible due to gene linkage, there is,\non his view, no drift. Wright did assert that\n\n\n[j]ust because the direction of drift is accidental, the result is a\nkaleidoscopic shifting of the average characters of the population\nthrough predominant types which practically are never repeated,\n(1931b: 207; see also Wright 1930: 354)\n\n\nbut that makes drift sound like a cause, not an outcome, and it does\nnot explicitly state that the \u201cshifting\u201d occurs at every\nlocus on every chromosome. But even if he did, Wright could certainly\nhave been mistaken about the effects of drift without being mistaken\nabout the phenomenon itself; notably, Provine does not deny the\nexistence of the random (i.e., indiscriminate) sampling of gametes,\nalthough he does object to the seeming reification of the term\n\u201cgene pool\u201d and the neglect of the relevance of\nchromosomes, points that are well-taken.\n",
