Capacity and Nature, Words and Meaning, and the Debate on Naturalness\n\nFrom He Yan and Wang Bi to the Seven Worthies of the Bamboo Grove and\nGuo Xiang, the main contours of Neo-Daoism can be discerned. Sharing\nthe same philosophical vocabulary and reacting to a common heritage,\nthe proponents of the new Learning in the Profound may appear to be\nspeaking with a single voice. On closer examination, it becomes\napparent that they seek in their own way to make sense of the mystery\nof Dao. Friendship and patronage do play an important role in early\nmedieval Chinese literati culture, but they do not diminish the\npremium placed on intellectual independence, rigor, and originality.\nThis is best reflected in the many debates that populate the world of\nNeo-Daoist learning.\n\nThe view of He Yan that the sage is by nature absolutely impartial,\nabove the fray of the emotions, attracted a great deal of attention at\nthat time. The Sanguo zhi (Chapter 28, commentary), for\nexample, reports that Zhong Hui (225\u2013264), who rivaled Wang Bi\nas one of the brightest intellectual stars of the age, and others all\nelaborated on it. Wang Bi, as we have seen, put forward a dissenting\nview, which on the basis of a particular logic of nothingness grounds\nthe possibility of sagehood in an original nature untainted by\ncognitive distortions and affective disturbances. Later, Guo Xiang\nsought a new resolution by aligning sagehood with self-realization.\nThe role of the emotions and the natural differences based on\nqi endowment may be admitted, but in the being of the sage\nthe burden of value attachment that they bring has been totally\n\u201cforgotten\u201d or lifted in the light of the equality of\nthings (e.g., see Guo Xiang, commentary to Zhuangzi 2).\nBearing directly on the question of sagehood is the larger debate on\nthe relationship between a person\u2019s capacity and nature.\n\nAlthough it is generally agreed that nature is inborn and formed by\nqi energies, whether it is solely responsible for a\nperson\u2019s capacity, be it intellectual, physical, psychological\nor moral, remains an issue. This is important not only because it\nconcerns the nature of sagehood, whether it is an attainable goal or\ndetermined by an essential sage nature, but also because the right\ntalent must be identified for public office. A late second-century or\nearly third-century work by Liu Shao, the Renwu zhi\n(translated into English as The Study of Human Abilities) has\nalready broached the question and attempted to map out the various\ntypes of talent and the signs by which they might be identified. This\ndeveloped into a major debate, on which Zhong Hui composed a treatise\ncalled \u201cOn the Four Roots of Capacity and Nature\u201d\n(Caixing siben lun).\n\nZhong\u2019s work has not survived, but it is widely reported that\nthe debate involved four distinct positions\u2014namely, that\ncapacity and nature are \u201cidentical\u201d (tong); that\nthey are \u201cdifferent\u201d (yi); that they\n\u201ccoincide\u201d (he); and that they\n\u201cdiverge\u201d (li) from each other.\n\nThe first view is represented by Fu Jia (also pronounced Fu Gu,\n209\u2013255), who emerged as a major policy maker during the Wei-Jin\ntransition. On this account, both nature and capacity are determined\nby one\u2019s qi endowment. Whereas nature is the inner\nsubstance, capacity reaches outward in functional ability and conduct.\nThis view finds eloquent support in another third-century work, the\n\u201cDisquisition on Capacity and Nature\u201d (Caixing\nlun) by Yuan Zhun, who was on good terms with Ruan Ji. According\nto Yuan, beings can be either excellent or of a poor quality. Whereas\nthe former are endowed with \u201cpure qi,\u201d the latter\nare constituted by energies of a more \u201cturbid\u201d\ncomposition. It is like a piece of wood, Yuan adds; whether it is\ncrooked or straight is a matter of nature, on the basis of which it\nhas a certain capacity that can be made to serve particular ends.\n\nThe second is represented by Li Feng (d. 254), according to whom Fu\nJia had misconstrued the relationship between capacity and nature.\nThis is because whereas nature is inborn, capacity is shaped by\nlearning. What nature provides is simply the biological apparatus or\nfaculties that enable a person to grow and to learn; the person one\nbecomes, in contrast, is the result of learning and putting into\npractice the teaching of the sages. Any accomplishment, including the\nattainment of sagehood, ultimately depends on effort. Yu Huan, a noted\nthird-century historian, provides a helpful analogy to explain the\npoint\u2014the effect of learning on a person, he says, is like\nadding color to a piece of plain silk (Sanguo zhi 13,\ncommentary).\n\nZhong Hui himself held the third view, which attempts to mediate\nbetween the first two positions. Although native endowment is\nnecessary for realized capacity, it is not sufficient. What is\nendowed, in other words, marks a person\u2019s potential, which must\nbe carefully nurtured and brought to fruition. For sages and\nimmortals, who are different in kind because of their exceptional\nqi constitution, innate capacity naturally manifests itself\ncompletely in extraordinary achievements. For ordinary human beings,\nhowever, nature does not amount to actual ability but only furnishes\ncertain aptitude, dispositions or directions of development. Of\ncourse, if the native endowment is extremely poor, there is not much\nthat can be done. Nevertheless, the real challenge to Fu Jia\u2019s\nidentity thesis is that an excellent endowment may go to waste because\nthe person succumbs to desire and would not learn.\n\nFinally, Wang Guang (d. 251) argued for the last position, which is\nstronger than Li Feng\u2019s and appears to be directed especially\nagainst Zhong Hui\u2019s modified identity thesis. Inborn nature does\nnot provide the necessary fertile ground for cultivation; rather, it\nneeds to be rectified by learning. Human beings are inherently driven\nby desire and therefore must rely on rituals and instruction to become\nresponsible individuals. In this sense, capacity and nature do not\ncoincide but diverge from each other.\n\nIt has been suggested that the debate should be understood in the\ncontext of the power struggle between the main rival factions in Wei\npolitics. Specifically, Fu Jia and Zhong Hui both sided with the\nfaction that was to emerge victorious and strike down Li Feng and Wang\nGuang. Political affiliation, like patronage, is certainly important,\nbut it does not dictate philosophical opinion in Neo-Daoism. He Yan,\nfor example, would favor Fu Jia\u2019s identity thesis, given his\nunderstanding of human nature, despite the fact that the latter had\ncriticized him openly. Similarly, Ji Kang would find Zhong Hui\u2019s\nattempt to accommodate learning and effort agreeable, even though he\nhad rejected Zhong\u2019s overtures to befriend him and in the end\nwas put to death at Zhong\u2019s instigation.\n\nAnother key debate in Neo-Daoist philosophy concerns the relationship\nbetween \u201cwords\u201d (yan) and \u201cmeaning\u201d\n(yi). The debate has its roots in the Yijing, where\nConfucius is made to ask whether words can fully disclose meaning.\nThis goes beyond the interpretation of any one work, but probes the\nnature of understanding itself. As common experience seems to suggest,\nwords often fail to express intense emotions or complex ideas. A\nminority view, represented by the late third-century thinker Ouyang\nJian, defended the thesis that meaning is completely\n\u201cexhausted\u201d or expressed by words (yan jin yi).\nThe majority of Xuanxue scholars, however, regarded words as\nnecessary but insufficient to understanding.\n\nA spokesman for the position that \u201cwords cannot fully express\nmeaning\u201d (yan bu jin yi) was Xun Can (ca.\n212\u2013240), who gained considerable notoriety for his claim that\nthe classics were but the \u201cchaff\u201d of the sages\u2019\nprofound learning. The conclusion is inescapable, according to Xun,\nfor meaning transcends the limiting confines of language. Wang Bi\nsupplies a fuller and more nuanced argument. Although meaning is\nmediated by words and images, the means of interpretation must not be\nconfused with the end itself. Words can in fact become an obstacle to\nunderstanding if they are made the focus of interpretation. Citing the\nZhuangzi, Wang maintains that the words and images that make\nup a text must be \u201cforgotten\u201d before its meaning can be\ncomprehended. To understand a poem, for example, it is not enough to\nassemble an exhaustive list of definitions. The words are\n\u201cforgotten\u201d or left behind in the sense that understanding\nreaches into the underlying world of ideas where a deeper meaning\nresides. Guo Xiang also makes clear that although ideas issue from\nwords, they cannot be reduced to their literal, surface meaning. This\nis especially important to understanding the Zhuangzi, which\nemploys a large number of parables and metaphors, often involving\nspiritual figures or supernatural exploits. Taken literally, they\nverge on the fantastic; understood properly, they intimate the wonder\nof the Dao and the order of ziran.\n\nThis diverges sharply from the Han hermeneutical model, which\ntypically on the basis of a kind of correspondence theory assumes that\nwords have fixed meanings located in external referents. Specifically,\nunder the dominance of yin-yang theories, the classics were seen to\nrefer to particular cosmological phenomena. For example, Han\ncommentators commonly took the word \u201cone\u201d to mean the pole\nstar. In contrast, Neo-Daoist writings show little interest in\ncosmological speculation. This does not mean that the authors had\nabandoned the yin-yang cosmology; rather, they took the classics to be\nconcerned with issues more profound than naming the various components\nof the cosmos. A poem may depict actual objects or events; but sense\nis not limited to reference, and the meaning of the whole transcends\nthe identity of its parts. From a new hermeneutical perspective,\nproponents of Xuanxue thus endeavor to reverse an\n\u201coutward\u201d interpretive course to return to the\n\u201croots\u201d; that is to say, to recapture the perceived core\nteachings of the sages. This may suggest direct illumination or\nintuition, a sudden apprehension of meaning. However, it should be\nremembered that all the major Neo-Daoists discussed here excelled in\nthe art of argumentation, which is to say that there is no substitute\nfor careful philosophical analysis. Once the chain of references is\nbroken, once the hermeneutical perspective is altered, interpretation\nis free to pursue the deeper meaning of the \u201cdark\u201d and\nprofound, which in the final analysis is what Xuanxue is all\nabout.\n\n\n\n\nFrom a broader perspective, given the dissatisfaction with Han\nConfucianism, many of the debates in Xuanxue revolve around\nthe relationship between \u201corthodox teachings\u201d\n(mingjiao)\u2014the normative \u201cnaming\u201d\n(ming) that determines standards and values\u2014and\nziran. Both offer an idealized picture of the world, an\nimagined state in which order and harmony prevailed and to which the\ntroubled world of the present must seek to return. Does the former,\nbound by doctrines of propriety, rituals, and government, oppose\nnaturalness and thwart all aspiration toward a life of \u201ccarefree\nwandering\u201d? The debate on \u201cnourishing life,\u201d for\nexample, reflects this concern. Two main approaches may be\ndistinguished, whose impact far exceeds the quiet preserves of the\nphilosophers\u2019 \u201cbamboo grove,\u201d to spark new trends in\nboth politics and culture.\n\nFor Wang Bi, it is clear that government and society should ideally\nconform to the principles of ziran, as they stem from the\nsame \u201croot.\u201d Guo Xiang is even more specific in arguing\nthat the norms and rites that define civilization are not alien to\nziran but in principle flow spontaneously from it. The\nnatural bond between mother and child, for example, attests to the\ninherent harmony between ideal mingjiao and ziran.\nAlthough decay and corruption may have set in, the ethics of\nnaturalness does not seek to escape from the roles and\nresponsibilities of sociopolitical life.\n\nTo Wang Bi, it is imperative that the ruler and those in power\n\u201creturn\u201d to \u201cemptiness and quiescence,\u201d in\nwhich state the right policies would naturally prevail, resulting in\npeace and abundance, and more importantly, simplicity, genuineness and\ncontentment. To Guo Xiang, the hierarchical structure of society need\nnot be oppressive, for each and every person is \u201cequal\u201d\nand self-sufficient, which enables an inner transcendence that is the\nmark of authenticity and the full realization of one\u2019s nature\nand capacity.\n\nDifferences in interpretation notwithstanding, Wang Bi and Guo Xiang\nconverge in recognizing the place of certain basic normative patterns\nand principles in the order of nature, and the need to ensure that\nthey do not deviate from it. This is the first main approach to the\ndebate between mingjiao and ziran. It is perhaps not\nincorrect to speak of their having brought together Confucian and\nDaoist concerns, inasmuch as Confucianism pays special attention to\npropriety and government, whereas Daoism focuses on naturalness. The\nsame may be said for Xiang Xiu, who wrote an essay entitled \u201cOn\nConfucianism and Daoism\u201d (Ru Dao lun) in his youth.\nAlthough he apparently discarded it and we have no knowledge of its\ncontent, the famous poet Xie Lingyun (385\u2013433) later spoke of\nXiang Xiu as having treated \u201cConfucianism and Daoism as\none.\u201d Nevertheless, Xuanxue is not a kind of\nscholasticism that pitches one school against another. Instead of\nseeing them as attempting to reconcile Confucianism with Daoism, it\nmay be suggested that they were primarily concerned with the\nsubstantive issue of the relationship between mingjiao and\nziran.\n\nJi Kang and Ruan Ji took the stronger view that the then prevalent\northodox teachings impinged on naturalness. The burden of worldly\nstriving, ultimately driven by desire, has become so great that it\nwould not be possible to maintain an inner purity and transcendence\nwhile following the norms and rites of society and tradition. Genuine\nfreedom is possible only if one goes beyond the strictures of\nnormative orthodox teachings and aligns oneself completely with\nziran, as Ji Kang boldly asserts in \u201cOn Dispelling\nSelf-interest.\u201d Going beyond mingjiao does not mean\nleaving the world behind in this context; again, the point is not\nrenunciation, but radical change, by reorienting one\u2019s sense of\npropriety and value. This not only invites philosophical debate but\nalso gives impetus to an avant-garde counter-culture development,\nwhich adds a tinge of romanticism to the Xuanxue\nmovement.\n\nAs the idea of naturalness gained currency, many prominent men of\nletters came to appreciate strong emotions as a sign of authenticity.\nThus, Wang Rong, the youngest member of the Seven Worthies of the\nBamboo Grove, did not try to contain his grief in accordance with the\nrequirement of ritual when his son died. The sage may be oblivious to\nthe call of the emotions, he explains, and men of inferior nature are\nincapable of experiencing true affection; \u201cit is precisely in\npeople like us that the deepest and most intense emotions find their\nplace\u201d (Shishuo xinyu 17.4). Although there is some\ndispute whether these words should be attributed to Wang Rong or his\ncousin, Wang Yan, the point remains that naked emotions had come to be\ncherished as a Neo-Daoist ideal. In the same spirit, Xun Can was\ndevastated by the death of his wife. In response to Fu Jia\u2019s\ncriticism that he was overreacting, Xun simply lamented that it would\nbe difficult to find again a woman of true beauty. His grief was so\nintense, we are told, that he died shortly after at the age of\ntwenty-eight (Sanguo zhi 10, commentary; cf. Shishuo\nxinyu 35.2).\n\nThe unaffected display of emotion often came into conflict with the\ncode of conduct sanctioned by orthodox teachings. Ruan Ji was\ncriticized on several occasions for his unorthodox behavior. These\naccounts, more than a record of events, serve to underscore the vast\ndivide that separates an idealized naturalness from the artificial and\noften hypocritical observance of orthodox customs in early medieval\nChina. Once unconventional behavior is seen to express naturalness and\nauthenticity, it is perhaps inevitable that more radical gestures\nwould come to create a colorful but nonetheless extremely slippery\nslope. For example, Liu Ling, another member of the Seven Worthies, is\nwell known for his fondness for wine. Never without a bottle in hand,\nwhen travelling he would ask an attendant to carry a shovel, so that\nhe could be buried on the spot should he die from a bout of\ndrunkenness (Jin shu 49). Answering his critics, who found\nhim naked, drinking with abandon in his house, Liu said, \u201cI take\nheaven and earth to be my dwelling, and my rooms are my coat and\npants; so what are you gentlemen doing in my pants?\u201d\n(Shishuo xinyu 23.6)\n\nAs Pure Conversation and Xuanxue culture captivated high\nsociety, many literati were quick to imitate such behavior. It became\nfashionable to give free rein to one\u2019s impulses, and many had\nhoped to acquire a reputation as a high-minded intellectual of pure\ncharacter and lofty ideals by opposing established norms and rituals.\nWhether this represents a deterioration of Neo-Daoism need not concern\nus. The point to note is that serious implications follow from a\nphilosophy of ziran. Of course, there were Neo-Daoists who\nobjected to this trend. For example, Yue Guang\n(252\u2013304)\u2014whom Wang Rong, Wang Yan, and other leading\nscholars praised as a rare talent capable of taking Xuanxue\nto new heights\u2014was obviously unimpressed by the extent to which\nmany of his contemporaries had gone in search of a\n\u201ccarefree\u201d life. \u201cIn mingjiao itself there\nis a blissful abode,\u201d he asks, \u201cso why go to such\nextremes?\u201d (Jin shu 43)\n",
