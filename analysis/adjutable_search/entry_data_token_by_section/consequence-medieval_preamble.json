    "main_text": "\n\nLatin medieval theories of consequence are systematic analyses by\nLatin medieval\n authors[1]\n of the logical relations between\n sentences[2],\n in particular the notions of entailment and valid inference, but also the semantics of conditionals. When\ndoes a sentence B follow from a sentence A? (For example, from\n\u2018Every human is an animal\u2019 one may infer \u2018Some\nanimal is a human\u2019.) What are the grounds for the relation of\nentailment/consequence? Are there different kinds of consequences?\nThese and other questions were extensively debated by these\nauthors.\n\nTheories of consequence explicitly acquired an autonomous status only\nin the 14th century, when treatises specifically on the\nconcept of consequence began to appear; but some earlier\ninvestigations also deserve the general title of \u2018theories of\nconsequence\u2019, in view of their scope, sophistication and\nsystematicity. Taken as a whole, medieval theories of consequence\nrepresent the first sustained attempt at adopting a\nsentential/propositional\n perspective[3]\n since the Stoics in Greek antiquity, and \u2014 unlike Stoic logic,\nwhich had little historical influence \u2014 provide the historical\nbackground for subsequent developments leading to the birth of modern\nlogic in the 19th century. Indeed, it may be argued that\nthe medieval concept of consequentia (in its different\nversions) is the main precursor of the modern concept of logical\nconsequence.\n",
