    "main_text": "Why Holist Explanations are Indispensable || The Argument from Differing Explanatory Interests\n2.5 The Argument from Differing Explanatory Interests\n\nThe argument from differing explanatory interests asserts that holist\nexplanations are indispensable insofar as they are capable of\nsatisfying explanatory interests that are distinct from the interests\nthat individualist explanations are able to satisfy. The argument has\nthe following basic structure. First, it is made clear that a certain\nnotion of explanation is adopted. By appeal to this notion, it is then\nargued that some holist explanations may serve explanatory interests\nthat cannot be satisfied by individualist explanations. It is\nconcluded that since the social sciences should satisfy these\nexplanatory interests, holist explanations are indispensable.\n\nThe argument has mainly been advanced since the early 1980s. One\ncommon version of it relies on the erothetic model of explanation,\naccording to which an explanation is an answer to a why-question. It\nhas been presented by Alan Garfinkel, and subsequently by other\ntheorists as well (see e.g., Garfinkel 1981; Haslanger 2016, 2018;\nKincaid 1996, 1997; Risjord 2000; Weber and Van Bouwel 2002). The\nprincipal point made is that some why-questions can only be adequately\nanswered by offering holist explanations. Consequently, since an\ninterest in answers to these why-questions should be met, holist\nexplanations are indispensable. Another well-known version of the\nargument from differing explanatory interests relies on the causal\ninformation view of explanation. It states that an explanation\nprovides information about the causal process leading to the event in\nneed of explanation. The key idea is that some information can only be\nprovided via holist explanations. Since an interest in this\ninformation should be satisfied, holist explanations are thus\nindispensable. This version of the argument has been presented by\nFrank Jackson and Philip Pettit (see Jackson and Pettit 1992a, 1992b;\nfor a comparison of the erothetic and the causal information view of\nexplanation, see Marchionni 2007). Their influential account will be\nexamined in more detail.\n\nEquipped with the causal information view of explanation, Jackson and\nPettit consider the explaining of particular events (Jackson and\nPettit 1992a). A holist explanation provides information about the\nmanner in which the instantiation of a social property, S,\nresulted in a certain event. Now, due to social properties being\nsupervenient on individualist ones, it is always possible to offer a\ncorresponding individualist explanation of the same event: the\nindividualist explanation offers information as to how the individuals\nwho realized S produced the event in question. For example,\nassume that the particular event in need of explanation is a rise in\ncrime. Here, the holist explanation might be that the rise in crime\nwas the result of a rise in unemployment, whereas the individualist\nexplanation might state that the crime rate went up because individual\na, b, c, etc. lost their jobs, and felt\nfrustrated about having little money and no job opportunities.\n\nThe key claim made by Jackson and Pettit is that these two\nexplanations provide different information. The holist explanation\nconveys that given the rise in unemployment, an increase in crime was\nalmost bound to occur. The reason is that\n\n\nhad the motivations and opportunities of those particular individuals\nnot changed, the motivations of others would have done so. (1992a:\n11)\n\n\nThus the holist explanation provides modally comparative information,\nthat is, information that brings out that what happened in the actual\nworld would also have taken place in a variety of possible worlds. By\ncontrast, the individualist explanation confines itself to pointing\nout that these particular individuals, with their changed job\nsituations and altered motivations, were responsible for the rise in\ncrime. As such, it offers modally contrastive information, that is,\ninformation that sets the actual world apart from other possible\nworlds. Because of this divergence in the information provided,\nJackson and Pettit conclude that holist explanations are\nindispensable. Unlike individualist explanations, holist explanations\nmay satisfy an explanatory interest in modally comparative\ninformation, and an interest in this sort of information should be\nmet.\n\nJackson and Pettit\u2019s version of the argument from differing\nexplanatory interests has been criticized for not taking into account\nthat pragmatic considerations may determine whether the information\nprovided by a holist explanation is considered to be of more\u2014or\nless\u2014interest than that offered by an individualist explanation\n(see Weber and Van Bouwel 2002). The idea that pragmatic\nconsiderations have a role to play is given center stage in the\nargument from pragmatic concerns.\n",
