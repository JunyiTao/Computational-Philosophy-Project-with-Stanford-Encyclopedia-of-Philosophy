Early Theories: Cost-Benefit Models\n\nEarly rational choice models of conformity maintained that, since\nnorms are upheld by sanctions, compliance is merely a\npayoff-maximizing strategy (Rommetveit 1955; Thibaut & Kelley\n1959): when others\u2019 approval and disapproval act as external\nsanctions, we have a \u201ccost-benefit model\u201d of compliance\n(Axelrod 1986; James Coleman 1990). Rule-complying strategies are\nrationally chosen in order to avoid negative sanctions or to attract\npositive sanctions. This class of rational choice models defines norms\nbehaviorally, equating them with patterns of behavior (while\ndisregarding expectations or values). Such approach relies heavily on\nsanctions as a motivating factor. According to Axelrod (1986), for\nexample, if we observe individuals to follow a regular pattern of\nbehavior and to be punished if they act otherwise, then we have a\nnorm. Similarly, Coleman (1990) argues that a norm coincides with a\nset of sanctions that act to direct a given behavior.\n\nHowever, it has been shown that not all social norms involve sanctions\n(Diamond 1935; Hoebel 1954). Moreover, sanctioning works generally\nwell in small groups and in the context of repeated interactions,\nwhere the identity of participants is known and monitoring is\nrelatively easy. Still, even in such cases there may be a so-called\nsecond-order public goods problem. That is, imposing negative\nsanctions on transgressors is in everybody\u2019s interest, but the\nindividual who observes a transgression faces a dilemma: she is to\ndecide whether or not to punish the transgressor, where punishing\ntypically involves costs; besides, there is no guarantee that other\nindividuals will also impose a penalty on transgressors when faced\nwith the same dilemma. An answer to this problem has been to assume\nthat there exist \u201cmeta-norms\u201d that tell people to punish\ntransgressors of lower-level norms (Axelrod 1986). This solution,\nhowever, only shifts the problem one level up: upholding the meta-norm\nitself requires the existence of a higher-level sanctioning\nsystem.\n\nAnother problem with sanctions is the following: a sanction, to be\neffective, must be recognized as such. Coleman and Axelrod typically\ntake the repeated prisoner\u2019s dilemma game as an example of the\nworking of sanctions. However, in a repeated prisoner\u2019s dilemma\nthe same action (\u201cC\u201d or \u201cD\u201d) must serve as\nboth the sanctioning action and the target action. By simply looking\nat behavior, it is unclear whether the action is a function of a\nsanction or a sanction itself. It thus becomes difficult to determine\nthe presence of a norm, or to assess its effect on choice as distinct\nfrom the individual strategies of players.\n\nA further consideration weakens the credibility of the view that norms\nare upheld only because of external sanctions. Often we keep\nconforming to a norm even in situations of complete anonymity, where\nthe probability of being caught transgressing is almost zero. In this\ncase fear of sanctions cannot be a motivating force. As a consequence,\nit is often argued that cases of \u201cspontaneous\u201d compliance\nare the result of internalization (Scott 1971): people who have\ndeveloped an internal sanctioning system feel guilt and shame at\nbehaving in a deviant way. Yet, we have seen that the Parsonian view\nof internalization and socialization is inadequate, as it leads to\npredictions about compliance that often run counter to empirical\nevidence.\n\nIn particular, James Coleman (1990) has argued in favor of reducing\ninternalization to rational choice, insofar as it is in the interest\nof a group to get another group to internalize certain norms. In this\ncase internalization would still be the result of some form of\nsocialization. This theory faces some of the same objections raised\nagainst Parsons\u2019 theory: norms that are passed on from parents\nto children, for example, should be extremely resistant to change;\nhence, one should expect a high degree of correlation between such\nnorms and behavior, especially in those cases where norms prescribe\nspecific kinds of actions. However, studies of normative beliefs about\nhonesty\u2014which one typically acquires during childhood\u2014show\nthat such beliefs are often uncorrelated with behavior (Freeman &\nAta\u00f6v 1960).\n\nBicchieri (1990, 1997) has presented a third, alternative view about\ninternalization. This view of internalization is cognitive, and is\ngrounded on the assumption that social norms develop in small,\nclose-knit groups where ongoing interactions are the rule. Once an\nindividual has learned to behave in a way consistent with the\ngroup\u2019s interests, she will tend to persist in the learned\nbehavior unless it becomes clear that\u2014on average\u2014the cost\nof upholding the norm significantly outweighs the benefits. Small\ngroups can typically monitor their members\u2019 behavior and\nsuccessfully employ retaliation whenever free-riding is observed. In\nsuch groups an individual will learn, maybe at some personal cost, to\ncooperate; she will then uphold the cooperative norm as a\n\u201cdefault rule\u201d in any new encounter, unless it becomes\nevident that the cost of conformity has become excessive. The idea\nthat norms may be \u201csluggish\u201d is in line with well-known\nresults from cognitive psychology showing that, once a norm has\nemerged in a group, it will tend to guide the behavior of its members\neven when they face a new situation (or are isolated from the original\ngroup; Sherif 1936).\n\nEmpirical evidence shows that norm-abiding behavior is not, as the\nearly rational choice models would have it, a matter of cost/benefit\ncalculation. Upholding a norm that has led one to fare reasonably well\nin the past is a way of economizing on the effort one would have to\nexert to devise a strategy when facing a new situation. This\nkind of \u201cbounded rationality\u201d approach explains why people\ntend to obey norms that sometimes put them at a disadvantage, as is\nthe case with norms of honesty. This does not mean, however, that\nexternal sanctions never play a role in compliance: for example, in\nthe initial development of a norm sanctions may indeed play an\nimportant role. Yet, once a norm is established, there are several\nmechanisms that may account for conformity.\n\nFinally, the view that one conforms only because of the\nthreat of negative sanctions does not distinguish norm-abiding\nbehavior from an obsession or an entrenched habit; nor does that view\ndistinguish social norms from hypothetical imperatives enforced by\nsanctions (such as the rule that prohibits naked sunbathing on public\nbeaches). In these cases avoidance of the sanctions associated with\ntransgressions constitutes a decisive reason to conform, independently\nof what others do. In fact, in the traditional rational choice\nperspective, the only expectations that matter are those about the\nsanctions that follow compliance or non-compliance. In those\nframeworks, beliefs about how other people will act\u2014as opposed\nto what they expect us to do\u2014are not a relevant explanatory\nvariable: however, this leads to predictions about norm compliance\nthat often run counter to empirical evidence.\n",
