    "main_text": "Properties: Basic Ideas || Relations\n1.5 Relations\n\nA relation is typically attributed to a plurality of objects. These\njointly instantiate the relation in question, if the\nattribution is veridical. In this case, the relata (as\narguments) and the relation (as attributed) are constituents of a\nstate of affairs. Depending on the number of objects that it can\nrelate, a relation is usually taken to have a number of\n\u201cplaces\u201d or a \u201cdegree\u201d (\u201cadicity\u201d,\n\u201carity\u201d), and is thus called \u201cdyadic\u201d\n(\u201ctwo-place\u201d), \u201ctriadic\u201d\n(\u201cthree-place\u201d), etc. For example, before and\nbetween are dyadic (of degree 2) and triadic (of degree 3),\nrespectively. In line with this, properties and propositions are\n\u201cmonadic\u201d and \u201czero-adic\u201d predicables, as they\nare predicated of one, and of no, object, respectively, and may then\nbe seen as limiting cases of relations (Bealer 1982, where properties,\nrelations and propositions are suggestively grouped under the acronym\n\u201cPRP;\u201d Dixon 2018; Menzel 1986; 1993; Swoyer 1998; Orilia\n1999; Van Inwagen 2004; 2015; Zalta 1983). This terminology is also\napplied to predicates and sentences; for example, the predicate\n\u201cbetween\u201d is triadic, and the sentence \u201cPeter is\nbetween Tom and May\u201d is zero-adic. Accordingly, standard\nfirst-order logic employs predicates with a fixed degree, typically\nindicated by a superscript, e.g., \\(P^1\\), \\(Q^2\\), \\(R^3\\), etc.\n\nIn natural language, however, many predicates appear to be\nmultigrade or variably polyadic; i.e., they can be\nused with different numbers of arguments, as they can be true of\nvarious numbers of things. For example, we say \u201cJohn is lifting\na table\u201d, with \u201clifting\u201d used as dyadic, as well as\n\u201cJohn and Mary are lifting a table\u201d, with\n\u201clifting\u201d used as triadic. Moreover, there is a kind of\ninference, called \u201cargument deletion\u201d, which also suggests\nthat many predicates that prima facie could be assigned a\ncertain fixed degree are in fact multigrade. For example, \u201cJohn\nis eating a cake\u201d suggests that \u201cis eating\u201d is\ndyadic, but since, by argument deletion, it entails \u201cJohn is\neating\u201d, one could conclude that it is also monadic and thus\nmultigrade. Often one can resist the conclusion that there are\nmultigrade predicates. For example, it could be said that \u201cJohn\nis eating\u201d is simply short for \u201cJohn is eating\nsomething\u201d. But it seems hard to find a systematic and\nconvincing strategy that allows us to maintain that natural language\npredicates have a fixed degree. This has motivated the construction of\nlogical languages that feature multigrade predicates in order to\nprovide a more appropriate formal account of natural language (Grandy\n1976; Graves 1993; Orilia 2000a). Since natural language predicates\nappear to be multigrade, one may be tempted to take the properties and\nrelations that they express to also be multigrade, and the metaphysics\nof science may lend support to this conclusion (Mundy 1989).\n\nSeemingly, relations are not jointly instantiated\nsimpliciter; how the instantiation occurs also plays\na role. This comes to the fore in particular with non-symmetric\nrelations such as loving. For example, if John loves Mary,\nthen loving is jointly instantiated by John and Mary in a\ncertain way, whereas if it is Mary who loves John, then\nloving is instantiated by John and Mary in another way.\nAccordingly, relations pose a special problem: explicating the\ndifference between facts, such as Abelard loves Eloise and\nEloise loves Abelard, that at least prima facie\ninvolve exactly the same constituents, namely a non-symmetric relation\nand two other items (loving, Abelard, Eloise). Such facts are\noften said to differ in \u201crelational order\u201d or in the\n\u201cdifferential application\u201d of the non-symmetric relation\nin question, and the problem then is that of characterizing what this\nrelational order or differential application amounts to.\n\nRussell (1903: \u00a7218) attributed an enormous importance to this\nissue and attacked it repeatedly. Despite this, it has been pretty\nmuch neglected until the end of last century, with only few others\nconfronting it systematically (e.g., Bergmann 1992; Hochberg 1987).\nHowever, Fine (2000) has forcefully brought it again on the\nontological agenda and proposed a novel approach that has received\nsome attention. Fine identifies standard and\npositionalist views (analogous to two approaches defended by\nRussell at different times (1903; 1984); cf. Orilia 2008). According\nto the former, relations are intrinsically endowed with a\n\u201cdirection\u201d, which allows us to distinguish, e.g.,\nloving and being loved: Abelard loves\nEloise and Eloise loves Abelard differ, because they\ninvolve two relations that differ in direction (e.g., the former\ninvolves loving and the latter being loved).\nAccording to the latter, relations have different\n\u201cpositions\u201d that can somehow host relata:\nAbelard loves Eloise and Eloise loves Abelard\ndiffer, because the two positions of the very same loving\nrelation are differently occupied (by Abelard and Eloise in one case\nand by Eloise and Abelard in the other case). Fine goes on to propose\nand endorse an alternative, \u201canti-positionalist\u201d\nstandpoint, according to which relations have neither direction nor\npositions. The literature on this topic keeps growing and there are\nnow various proposals on the market, including new versions of\npositionalism (Orilia 2014; Donnelly 2016; Dixon 2018), and\nprimitivism, according to which differential application\ncannot be analyzed (MacBride 2014).\n\nRussell (1903: ch. 26) also had a key role in leading philosophers to\nacknowledge that at least some relations, in particular\nspatio-temporal ones, are external, i.e., cannot be reduced\nto monadic properties, or the mere existence, of the relata,\nin contrast to internal relations that can be so reduced. This was a\nbreakthrough after a long tradition tracing back at least to Aristotle\nand the Scholastics wherein there seems to be hardly any place for\nexternal relations (see entry on\n medieval theories of relations).[4]\n",
