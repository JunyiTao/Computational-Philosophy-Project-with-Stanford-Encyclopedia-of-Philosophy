Contrary to his remarks in the First\nMeditation, he notes that dreams are only rarely connected to\nwaking memories and are often discontinuous, as when dream characters\nsuddenly appear or disappear. He then introduces the coherence\ntest:\n\n\nBut when I perceive objects with regard to which I can distinctly\ndetermine both the place whence they come, and that in which they are,\nand the time at which they appear to me, and when, without\ninterruption, I can connect the perception I have of them with the\nwhole of the other parts of my life, I am perfectly sure that what I\nthus perceive occurs while I am awake and not during sleep.\n(Meditation VI. 24) \n\n\nFor all practical purposes, he has now found a mark by which dreaming\nand waking can be distinguished (cf. Meditation I.7), and\neven if the coherence test is not fail-safe, the threat of dream\ndeception has been averted.\n\nDescartes\u2019 remarks about the discontinuous and ad hoc nature of many\ndreams are backed up by empirical work on dream bizarreness (see\nHobson 1988; Revonsuo & Salmivalli 1995). Still, many of his\ncritics were not convinced this helped his case against the skeptic.\nEven if Descartes\u2019 revised phenomenological description characterizes\nmost dreams, one might occasionally merely dream of successfully\nperforming the test (Hobbes 1641), and in some dreams, one might seem\nto have a clear and distinct idea but this impression is false\n(Bourdin 1641). Both the coherence test and the criterion of clarity\nand distinctness would then be unreliable.\n\nHow considerations of empirical plausibility impact the dream argument\ncontinues to be a matter of debate. Grundmann (2002) appeals to\nscientific dream research to introduce an introspective criterion:\nwhen we introspectively notice that we are able to engage in critical\nreflection, we have good reason to think that we are awake and not\ndreaming. However, this assumes critical reasoning to be uniformly\nabsent in dreams. If attempts at critical reasoning do occur in dreams\nand if they generally tend to be corrupted, the introspective\ncriterion might again be problematic (Windt 2011, 2015a). There are\nalso cases in which even after awakening, people mistake what was in\nfact a dream for reality (Wamsley et al. 2014). At least in certain\nsituations and for some people, dream deception might be a genuine\ncause of concern (Windt 2015a).\n",
