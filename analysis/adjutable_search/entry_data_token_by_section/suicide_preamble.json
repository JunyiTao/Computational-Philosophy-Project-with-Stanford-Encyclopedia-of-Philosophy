    "main_text": "\n\nThroughout history, suicide has evoked an astonishingly wide range of\nreactions\u2014bafflement, dismissal, heroic glorification, sympathy,\nanger, moral or religious condemnation\u2014but it is never\nuncontroversial. For example, suicide has long been a central concern\nwithin many academic disciplines, including sociology, anthropology,\npsychology, and psychiatry. These disciplines converge in the\nmultidisciplinary field of suicidology. But there remain many\ncontroversies within suicidology, including which methodologies are\nbest suited to identify the causes of suicide and whether the study of\nsuicide can be fully disentangled from researchers\u2019 political or\ninstitutional commitments. (Maung 2020; for concerns about the\npolitical dimensions of suicide research, see work within\n\u2019critical suicidology\u2019 such as White et al. 2016)\n\nBut perhaps the most enduring controversies surrounding suicide are\nphilosophical. For philosophers, suicide raises a host of conceptual,\nmoral, and psychological questions. Among these questions are: What\nmakes a person\u2019s behavior suicidal? What motivates such\nbehavior? Is suicide morally permissible, or even morally required in\nsome extraordinary circumstances? Is suicidal behavior rational? Is\naiding others to commit suicide morally permissible or even required\nin some extraordinary circumstances? This article will examine the\nmain currents of historical and contemporary Western philosophical\nthought surrounding these questions.\n",
