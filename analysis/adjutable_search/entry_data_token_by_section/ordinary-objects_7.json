    "main_text": "Against Conservative Ontologies || Debunking Arguments\n2.6 Debunking Arguments\n\nWe encounter some atoms arranged treewise and some atoms arranged\ndogwise, and we naturally take there to be a dog and a tree. But there\nare different ways we might have carved up such a situation into\nobjects. Instead of taking there to be a tree there, we might instead\nhave taken there to be a trog: a partly furry, partly wooden object\ncomposed of the dog and the tree-trunk.\n\nWhy, though, do we naturally take there to trees rather than trogs?\nPlausibly, this is largely the result of various biological and\ncultural contingencies. If so, then there arguably is little reason to\nexpect that our beliefs about which objects there are would be even\napproximately correct. This realization, in turn, is meant to debunk\nour beliefs about which objects there are:\n\n(DK1)\nThere is no explanatory connection between how we believe the\nworld to be divided up into objects the how the world actually is\ndivided up into objects.\n(DK2)\nIf so, then it would be a coincidence if our object beliefs turned\nout to be correct.\n(DK3)\nIf it would be a coincidence if our object beliefs turned out to\nbe correct, then we shouldn\u2019t believe that there are trees.\n(DK4)\nSo, we shouldn\u2019t believe that there are trees.\n\n\nThe idea behind DK1 is that we are inclined to believe in trees rather\nthan trogs largely because prevailing conventions in the communities\nwe were born into generally prohibit treating some things as the parts\nof a single object unless they are connected or in some other way\nunified. These conventions themselves likely trace back to an innate\ntendency to perceive only certain arrays of qualities as being borne\nby a single object and its being adaptive for creatures like us to so\nperceive the world. But the facts about which distributions of atoms\ndo compose something, or about which arrays of qualities truly are\nborne by a single object, have no role to play in explaining why this\nis adaptive. Thus, it would seem that we divide up the world into\nobjects the way that we do for reasons having nothing at all to do\nwith how the world actually is divided up.\n\nThe idea behind DK2 is that if there truly is this sort of disconnect\nbetween the object facts and the factors that lead us to our object\nbeliefs, then it could only be a lucky coincidence if those factors\nled us to beliefs that lined up with the object facts. And the idea\nbehind DK3 is that since we have no rational grounds for believing\nthat we got lucky, we shouldn\u2019t believe that we did, in which\ncase we should suspend our beliefs about which objects there are and,\nin particular, our belief that there are\n trees.[38]\n\n\nSuch debunking arguments fall short of establishing that eliminativism\nis true or that conservatism is false. But, if successful, they do\nlend powerful support to eliminativism, by effectively neutralizing\nany reasons we might take ourselves to have for accepting conservatism\nor for wanting to resist the arguments for\n eliminativism.[39]\n\nThe arguments also lend indirect support to permissivism, insofar as\npermissivists are well positioned to deny DK2. By permissivist lights,\nhaving accurate beliefs about which kinds of objects there are is a\ntrivial accomplishment (not a coincidence), since there are objects\nanswering to virtually every way that we might have perceptually and\nconceptually divided up a situation into objects. The ordinary and\nextraordinary objects are all already out there waiting to be noticed;\nall that our conventions do is determine which ones are selected for\n attention.[40]\n\nDeflationists also seem well positioned to deny DK2. Relativists will\nsay that, while we could easily have divided up the world differently,\nwe could not easily had divided up the world incorrectly. For had we\ndivided the world into trogs rather than trees, we would then have had\na different conceptual scheme, and we would have correctly believed\nthat trogs exist-relative-to-that-scheme. Quantifier variantists will\nsay that, had we divided the world into trogs but not trees, we would\nthen have correctly believed that trogs\n exist*.[41]\n\nAlternatively, one might try to resist DK1 by identifying an\nexplanatory connection between the way the world is divided up and our\nbeliefs about how it is divided up. For instance, one might say that\nwe have the object beliefs that we do as a result of intelligent\ndesign: God, wanting us to have largely accurate beliefs, arranged for\nus to have experiences that represent trees and not trogs. Or one\nmight take a rationalist line, according to which, through some\ncapacity for rational insight, we intellectually apprehend relevant\nfacts about which objects together compose something. Or one might opt\nfor an anti-realist line and insist that there is a mind-to-world\nexplanatory connection: object beliefs determine the object facts and\nare therefore an excellent guide to which kinds\n exist.[42]\n",
