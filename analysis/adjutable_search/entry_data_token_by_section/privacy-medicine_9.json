    "main_text": "Physical Privacy || Bodily Modesty\n2.2 Bodily Modesty\n\nPhilosophers in the virtue ethics and Christian ethics traditions have\nidentified modesty as a moral virtue (Schueler 1999). Modesty is a\nform of physical privacy of special interest to medical ethics. If\npatients are to receive the best care, they must be willing to expose\ntheir bodies to medical personnel and technicians. Removing\none\u2019s clothing for purposes of examination and testing is\nroutine for most health care consumers. Busy emergency rooms and\nneighborhood clinics may be unable to cloak or seclude patients at\nall. Harried physicians may forget \u201cbedside manners\u201d and\nfail sufficiently to honor patients\u2019 modesty expectations.\nIn-patients in teaching hospitals are expected to adapt to diminished\nphysical privacy, since medical students and researchers accompany\nattending physicians on rounds and participate in care.\n\nYet feelings of modesty and felt obligations of bodily modesty are\ncommonplace. Many individuals understand bodily modesty as a moral\nvirtue, and act accordingly. Under some religious traditions, such as\nthose of Muslims, Orthodox Jews and the Amish, bodily modesty is a\nrequirement of faith. Being asked to disrobe, even for a good reason,\nmay impose the cost of going against principle or desire (Kato and\nMann 1996).\n\nHealth care providers respond to the modesty values of their patients\nin a number of ways. They provide special modesty garments and\nsheeting to minimize nudity. They ask patients to uncover only those\nportions of the body which must be exposed, and then only for the\nperiod of time necessary. While hospitals cannot offer every\nin-patient a private room, shared rooms are generally dividable by\ncurtains that grant patients some degree of physical seclusion (and\nassociational intimacy with visiting family and friends). Male\ngynecologists and obstetricians help patients cope with sex-specific\nmodesty norms and sexual abuse concerns by working with female\nassistants. Some health care providers maintain medical procedures\nstaffing policies sensitive to modesty and harassment concerns.\nIndeed, mammograms on women are generally performed by female\ntechnicians. On the other hand, the radiologists and radiology\ntechnicians who deliver prolonged, intimate radiation services to\nbreast cancer patients are likely to be male. Patients may encounter\nhealth institutions and providers who are unwilling to honor what they\nmay regard as impractical or discriminatory preferences for same-sex\nor same race caregivers, preferences sometimes motivated rightly or\nwrongly by modesty concerns.\n",
