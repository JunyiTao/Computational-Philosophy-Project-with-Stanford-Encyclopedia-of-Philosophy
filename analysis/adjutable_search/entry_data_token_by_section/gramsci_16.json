    "main_text": "Prison Writings || The Modern Prince\n4. Reception of the Prison Writings\n\nGramsci\u2019s prison writings were first published in Italy after\nthe Second World War: his letters from prison in 1947 (see GLP),\nwinning the Viareggio literary prize that year; and his\nNotebooks in six, thematic volumes of selections between 1948\nand 1951. A complete, \u201ccritical\u201d edition of the\nNotebooks (in four volumes) was published in 1975 (see\nQC).\n\nThe distance in time since their drafting, and the fragmented nature\nof the texts themselves, meant that the prison writings did not\ndirectly address the new environment into which they emerged. The\nmeaning and implications of his thinking were therefore heavily\nmediated by national and geopolitical concerns through which,\ninevitably, the Notebooks were read. Over time\u2014as his\nwritings became available and scholarship on his thought\nimproved\u2014recognition of his distinctiveness as a thinker has\ngrown around the world. Gramsci\u2019s account of hegemony,\nespecially, has been a highly effective resource for cultural and\npolitical analysis (see Martin 2022).\n\nWhere precisely did Gramsci\u2019s philosophical innovations lie for\nhis later readers? Over the years, different, interpretations of\nGramsci have tended to emphasize competing aspects of his thought as\nits philosophical \u201ccore\u201d (see Liguori 2012 [2022]).\n\nThe initial reception of Gramsci\u2019s writings was shaped by the\nItalian Communist Party (Partito comunista italiano, or PCI),\nparticularly by its leader since the mid-1920s, Palmiro Togliatti, who\nemphasized their significance for a renewed communist strategy. To\ndemonstrate allegiance to Stalin and the USSR, Togliatti presented an\n\u201cacceptable\u201d version of Gramsci that suited the\nPCI\u2019s cautious post-war politics. Selective editing of the\nNotebooks downplayed overt conflict with Stalin, emphasizing\nGramsci\u2019s continuity with the Soviet philosophical orthodoxy of\n\u201cdialectical materialism\u201d and a Leninist model of\nrevolution. However, following Stalin\u2019s death in 1953 Togliatti\nunderscored Gramsci\u2019s unique formulation of Marxism and his\ncontinuity with native Italian currents of philosophy. This endorsed\nTogliatti\u2019s own view of the PCI as a pragmatic, mass-based party\npursuing its own \u201cItalian road to socialism\u201d; operating as\na \u201ccollective intellectual\u201d to mobilize the proletariat\nand its allies in a uniquely national and democratic project (see\nTogliatti 1979).\n\nNow a canonical figure in Italian Marxism, Gramsci\u2019s reading of\nhistory\u2014particularly his view of the Risorgimento as a failed\nbourgeois revolution\u2014was called into question in the late 1950s.\nIn one notable debate, liberal historian Rosario Romeo disputed that\neconomic conditions could have permitted the nineteenth-century\nbourgeoisie to act as a \u201cJacobin\u201d force by mobilizing the\npeasantry and other subaltern classes. Gramsci\u2019s reasoning (and,\nby extension, the PCI\u2019s sense of its distinctive national\nstrategy) was premised on a moral and political, rather than genuinely\nobjective, interpretation of history (Liguori 2012 [2022:\n121\u201323]; Davis 1979).\n\nAlthough Romeo\u2019s critique was disputed by Gramscian historians,\nfrom the 1960s, as more of his writings were published and\ntranslations became available, Gramsci was increasingly read\nindependently of (and in opposition to) the PCI\u2019s strategic\nconcerns (see Mouffe 1979). His seemingly \u201cheretical\u201d\nformulation of Marxist theory came to occupy his readers, especially\nas regards his debt to Crocean historicism, his ambiguous relation to\nmaterialism and to Leninism (see Bobbio 1979). More widely,\nGramsci\u2019s exploration of cultural and political superstructures\nresulted in a tendency to categorize him as a \u201cwestern\u201d\nMarxist, concerned less with economic conditions or coercion and more\nwith ideological barriers to class consciousness (see Anderson 1976,\n1976\u201377). Hegemony was associated with a general theory of\ncultural and ideological domination relevant to the critique of\nconsumer capitalism.\n\nThrough the late 1960s and 70s, as western states experienced economic\nand ideological crises, Gramsci\u2019s analyses were applied\nseparately from communist strategy or philosophical idealism. Marxist\nsociologists such as Nicos Poulantzas (1968 [1973]) and, later, Bob\nJessop (1990) found in hegemony a resource to explore the permutations\nof the capitalist state and its shifting class coalitions. British\nCultural Studies\u2014especially the work of Raymond Williams and\nStuart Hall\u2014saw in Gramsci an inventive, \u201ccultural\nMarxist\u201d framework for examining popular lived experience of\nclass domination. Debates over the functions of mass media and\npopulist ideology, particularly with the emergence of\n\u201cThatcherism\u201d in the 1980s, were uniquely attuned to the\ndynamics of hegemonic politics suggested in Gramsci\u2019s writings\n(see Hall 1988; Jessop et al. 1988).\n\n\u201cPost-Marxist\u201d approaches to hegemony from the 1980s built\non the established popularity of Gramsci\u2019s thought, particularly\nits application in the field of ideology studies. Ernesto Laclau and\nChantal Mouffe\u2019s Hegemony and Socialist Strategy (1985)\nrecast hegemony as the theoretical basis to a strategy of\n\u201cradical democracy\u201d, aimed at unifying multiple and\ndiverse social struggles. Drawing on \u201cpoststructuralist\u201d\nphilosophies, hegemony was conceived as a general principle of\n\u201cdiscursive articulation\u201d\u2014the contingent formation\nof a collective identity\u2014with no \u201cnecessary\u201d\nfoundation in economic class. For them, Gramsci\u2019s core\nphilosophical insight lay in demonstrating hegemony\u2019s political\n\u201clogic\u201d, rather than any sociological concerns. They\nsought to discard the residual economism in his thinking and thus the\nautomatic privilege granted by Marxism to class agency in hegemonic\npolitics. In their view, various hegemonic formations co-exist, and a\nradical democratic politics does not require working class\nleadership.\n\nGramsci\u2019s Notebooks continued to attract scholarly\ninterest after the demise of the Soviet Union and the dissolution of\nthe PCI. Recent approaches have been drawn, increasingly, to the\nnuances and inflections in his analyses, often neglected in the\ntendency to focus on \u201chegemony\u201d and its relation to\nMarxist theory. While the concept remains important, there is growing\nappreciation of other themes in Gramsci\u2019s philosophy of politics\nand their relevance to a variety of fields. His ideas remain a source\nof insight for non-orthodox Marxisms (see Thomas 2009), and his\nconcepts have been extended to academic fields such as International\nRelations and Global Political Economy (see Gill 1993) and to\nsocio-political contexts beyond Europe and the \u201cWest\u201d (see\nMorton 2007; Fonseca\n2016).  Gramsci\u2019s own experience as an internal migrant who\n\u201clooked at modernity from the bottom of its peripheries\u201d\n(Urbinati 1998: 371), and his particular attention to the struggles of\n\u201csubaltern\u201d classes in the formation of national cultures,\nhave inspired forms of postcolonial literary criticism and politics\nquite at odds with the communist frame in which his ideas originated\n(see Srivastava & Bhattacharya 2012).\n",
