Preliminaries\n\nThe term \u201cgeneralized quantifier\u201d reflects that these\nentities were introduced in logic as generalizations of the standard\nquantifiers of modern logic, \\(\\forall\\) and\n \\(\\exists\\).[1]\n In retrospect one may say that \\(\\forall\\) and \\(\\exists\\) have been\nfound to be just two instances of a much more general concept of\nquantifier, making the term \u201cgeneralized\u201d superfluous.\nToday it is also common to use just \u201cquantifier\u201d for the\ngeneral notion, but \u201cgeneralized quantifier\u201d is still\nfrequent for historical reasons. This article employs both terms, with\na tendency to insert \u201cgeneralized\u201d in logical contexts,\nand to drop it in linguistic contexts.\n\nWe distinguish quantifier expressions from what they signify\nor denote, the (generalized) quantifiers themselves. In logical\nlanguages, quantifier expressions are variable-binding operators.\nThus, \\(\\exists\\) is the familiar operator such that in a formula\n\\(\\exists\n x\\f\\),[2]\n \\(\\exists x\\) binds all free occurrences of x in \\(\\f\\). It\nsignifies the quantifier \u201cthere exists\u201d\u2014we\u2019ll\nsee shortly exactly what this object is. Likewise, the symbol \\(Q_0\\)\nis often used as a variable-binding operator signifying \u201cthere\nexist infinitely many\u201d.\n\nIn natural languages a variety of expressions have been seen as\nquantifier expressions, for example, each of the following English\nexpressions: \n\n\neverything, nothing, three books, the ten\nprofessors, John, John and Mary, only John, firemen, every, at least\nfive, most, all but ten, less than half of the, John\u2019s, some\nstudent\u2019s, no\u2026except Mary, more male than female,\nusually, never, each\n other.[3]\n\n\nWhat, then, are generalized quantifiers? Before answering that\nquestion, a brief historical prelude is helpful.\n",
