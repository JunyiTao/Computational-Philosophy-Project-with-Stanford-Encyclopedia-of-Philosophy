While offering new exciting\npotentials, concerns have also been raised about the social and\nethical implications of the new techno-scientific strategies.\n\nSystems medicine, the medical application of systems biology, aims for\nmajor breakthroughs towards understanding of complex diseases such as\ncancer and heart conditions (Voit & Brigham 2008; Wolkenhauer et\nal. 2013). Ambitious projects within systems biology such as the\nVirtual Physiological Human raise intriguing questions about\nhow computational modeling will influence future biomedical research\n(Kohl & Noble 2009; Kolodkin et al. 2011; Hunter et al. 2013).\nMulti-scale cardiac models are already being developed with important\nimplications for the potential to address physiological variability,\nand for philosophical discussions of model validation and the relation\nbetween experiment and simulation (Carusi et al. 2012; Carusi\n2014).\n\nDevelopments in systems and synthetic biology have encouraged\nphilosophers to revisit traditional conceptions of disease as\ndysfunctional states (Holm 2013, 2014), or broken mechanisms (Gross\n2011). Rather than focusing on the function or dysfunction of specific\ngenes or molecular mechanisms, network approaches to disease may\nsuggest a more dynamic approach to disease that accounts for an\nincreasing number of integrated processes (Del Sol et al. 2010; Huang\net al. 2009). Cancer research is a major priority of systems biology\nresearch, and exemplifies a field where data-intensive approaches may\nbe needed to address biological complexity (Plutynski 2021).\nDevelopments in cancer genomics have revealed an astonishing diversity\nof tumor types, suggesting that finer-grained disease-categories and\nmore targeted treatments may be needed. This line of research has\nopened new research venues, such as the development of multi-action\nremedies targeting numerous disease-related pathways identified via\ngenomic analysis. The discovered diversity of mutations identified in\nsequenced tumors has, however, also led to heated debates on whether\nthe behavior and identity of cancer cells can fully be understood at\nthe molecular level. Some have stressed the need to move beyond\ngene-centric or cell-centric approaches and to consider cancer as a\nproblem of tissue-organization (Soto & Sonnenschein 2011).\nAlthough some systems biological explanations of cancer illustrate the\npossibility of integrating \u201ctop-down\u201d and\n\u201cbottom-up\u201d approaches (Bertolaso 2016; Plutynski and\nBertolaso 2018), systems biology research also displays a variety and\nsometimes conflicting approaches to cancer. These debates not only\nhave philosophical implications for discussions about reductionism but\nalso\u00a0practical implications for how cancer should be approached\nexperimentally and treated in clinical practice (Bertolaso 2011; Soto\net al. 2008).\n\nOne of the important problems in contemporary medicine is how to\naccount for patient-specific variation. Systems medicine is sometimes\nhighlighted as a route to personalized or precision medicine (Hood et\nal. 2015). The aim to personalize medicine is as old as the medical\nprofession itself, but it is now promoted through data-intensive\ncomputational strategies with exciting new potentials (Tutton 2014).\nProponents are optimistic that large-scale modeling of\npatient-specific data can result in a paradigm-shift from a\none-size-fits-all model in traditional medicine, toward a more\nefficient systemic approach that can tailor disease prevention,\ndiagnosis, and treatment to individual patients. Against this\noptimism, some have raised concerns about uncertainties and potential\nharmful results associated with genetic risk profiling, including the\nrisk of overdiagnosis and unnecessary medicalization of healthy\nindividuals (Green & Vogt 2016; Vogt et al. 2016, 2019).\nPhilosophers and social scientists have also critically examined how\nrisk information is communicated to the public by companies\ncapitalizing on personalized genomics, and discussed how such\ninformation may affect health outcomes and perceptions of health\n(Bartol 2013; Prainsack 2017; Reydon et al. 2012). More generally,\nsystems medicine has spurred debates about whether the vision to\npredict and control future health outcomes is compatible with a\nhumanistic approach to medicine and social complexity (Tutton 2014;\nVogt et al. 2014). Moreover, combination of systems medicine and\nsynthetic biology applications opens also for what O\u2019Malley\n(2011a) termed constructive personalized medicine, where\npredictive modeling and synthetic interventions are combined.\nPromising technologies for these purposes now include CRISPR-Cas9 gene\nediting, organ-on-chip models, 3D bioprinting and organoid-based\nmodels for replacement therapies. While creating unprecedented\npotentials for disease treatment, they also raise ethical questions\nabout artificial chimerism and human enhancement (Pio-Lopez 2021).\n\nIn the context of synthetic biology, discussions often center on\nwhether the attempt to create synthetic organisms and the use of\ndesign metaphors can compromise our perspective on and respect for\nlife (Christiansen 2016a; Douglas et al. 2013; McLeod and Nerlich\n2017). Other ethical debates consider the risk of negative\nconsequences of specific synthetic applications. Discussions often\ninvolve so-called dual-use problems where the benefits of genetically\nmodified organisms are weighted against potential problems and risks.\nExamples are biohazards associated with intentional or unintentional\nrelease of synthetic pathogens, or the possibility that synthetic\nproduction of biomedical compounds opens for efficient and inexpensive\nproduction of illegal drugs (Christiansen 2016b). Concerns have also\nbeen raised about the commercialization of biotechnologies. Examples\nare applications of broad patents concerning minimal genomes or\nsynthetic genes (O\u2019Malley et al. 2008), and considerations about\nstructural injustice if industrial production via synthetic organisms\noutcompete conventional farming in developing countries (Christiansen\n2016b). Thus, the strong push to address societal problems through\nsystems and synthetic biology gives rise to new exciting possibilities\nbut also calls for critical examination from philosophers and social\nscientists.\n",
