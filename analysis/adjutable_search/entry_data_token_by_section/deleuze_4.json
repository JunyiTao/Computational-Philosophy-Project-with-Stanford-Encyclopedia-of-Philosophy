    "main_text": "Collaboration with Guattari\n4. Collaboration with Guattari\n\nFollowing his work in the philosophy of difference, Deleuze meets\nGuattari in the aftermath of May 1968. These famous\n\u201cevents,\u201d which have marked French culture and politics\never since, brought together students and workers, to the befuddlement\nof the established guardians of the revolution, the French Communist\nParty. Days of general strikes and standoffs with the police led the\nFrench President Charles de Gaulle to call a general election. De\nGaulle\u2019s call for a parliamentary solution to the crisis was\nbacked by the Communists, who were evidently as scared of any\nrevolution from below\u2014which by definition would lack the party\ndiscipline they so craved\u2014as were the official holders of State\npower, to whose position they aspired. The worker-student movement\neventually collapsed, leaving memories of non-scripted social\ninteractions and revealing the investments of the Party, lampooned\nthereafter as \u201cbureaucrats of the revolution,\u201d in\nFoucault\u2019s words in his Preface to the English translation of\nAnti-Oedipus. The French Communist Party\u2019s agreement\nwith De Gaulle to allow a parliamentary solution to the social crisis\nwas a glaring example of the horizon of identity (the desire that\nsomeone be in control of a central State bureaucracy) that allowed an\nopposition (of the Gaullists and the Communists as rivals for control\nof the State) to shackle difference.\n\nThe government response to May 1968 changed French academic life in\ntwo ways. First, institutionally, by the creation of Paris VIII\n(Vincennes) where Deleuze taught; and second, in the direction of the\nphilosophy of difference, which became explicitly political post-1968.\nIt became, in fact, a politics of philosophy dedicated to exposing the\nhistorical force relations producing identity in all its ontological\nand epistemological forms. In other words, the philosophy of\ndifference now set out to show how the unified objects of the world,\nthe unified subjects who know and hence control them, the unified\nbodies of knowledge that codify this knowledge, and the unified\ninstitution of philosophy that polices the whole affair, are products\nof historical, political forces in combat with other forces.\n\nIn purely philosophical terms, the works with Guattari naturalize the\nstill-Kantian framework of Difference and Repetition. By the\ntime of Anti-Oedipus and A Thousand Plateaus Deleuze\nand Guattari explicitly thematize that the syntheses they investigate\nare fully material syntheses, syntheses of nature in geological as\nwell as biological, social, and psychological registers (Welchman\n2009). Not just organic syntheses, but inorganic ones as well, are\n\u201cspatio-temporal dynamisms.\u201d With this full naturalization\nof syntheses, the question of panpsychism is brought into full relief\n(Protevi 2011), since material syntheses are as much syntheses of\nexperience as they are syntheses of things, as we see in the title of\nChapter 3 of A Thousand Plateaus: \u201cThe Geology of\nMorals: Who does the earth think it is?\u201d\n",
