Mathematical Tools: Models and Proofs\n\nTwentieth Century technical work on the notion of logical\nconsequence has centered on two different mathematical tools, proof\ntheory and model theory. Each of these can be seen as explicating\ndifferent aspects of the concept of logical consequence, backed by\ndifferent philosophical perspectives.\n",
