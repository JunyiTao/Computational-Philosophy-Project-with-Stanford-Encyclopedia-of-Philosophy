One thing that is meant by it is, roughly, that the\nmeanings of certain terms seem to divide the world up in a way that is\nmore natural for men than for women. Good examples of this come from\nthe terms \u2018foreplay\u2019 and \u2018sex\u2019.\n\u2018Sex\u2019 is generally taken to refer to an act that is\ndefined in terms of male orgasm, while the sexual activities during\nwhich many women have their orgasms are relegated to secondary status,\nreferred to by terms like \u2018foreplay\u2019. These terms, then,\ncan be seen as based in a male perspective on sex. (It is worth noting\nthat the \u2018male perspective\u2019 claim need not rest on the\n(implausible) idea that this perspective is shared by all men. Rather,\nit can rest on claims about what is typical for men, or on the claim\nthat the only perspective from which certain understandings make sense\nis a male one.) As a result, these terms may serve as a barrier to\naccurate communication or even thought about women\u2019s experiences\nof sex (Cameron 1985; Moulton 1981b; Spender 1980 [1985]). Catharine\nMacKinnon and Sally Haslanger also discuss legal definitions of\n\u2018rape\u2019 as (among other things) involving more than\n\u2018the normal level of force\u2019, an understanding that seems\ncommitted to the idea that some level of force is acceptable in sexual\nrelations (Haslanger 1995: 109; MacKinnon 1989: 173).\n\nLanguages may also lack words for things that matter a great deal to\nwomen. This sort of gap is another way that a language can be seen as\nencoding a male worldview. The term \u2018sexual harassment\u2019,\nfor example, is a recent feminist innovation. Women\u2019s discussion\nof their experiences led them to see a certain common element to many\nof their problems, and as a result they invented the term\n\u2018sexual harassment\u2019. Once the problem was named, it became\nmuch easier to fight sexual harassment, both legally and by educating\npeople about it (Farley 1978; Spender 1985).\n\nMiranda Fricker (2007) calls gaps such as that before the invention of\nthe term \u2018sexual harassment\u2019 a form of hermeneutical\ninjustice. Roughly speaking, this is what occurs when \u201csome\nsignificant area of one\u2019s social experience [is] obscured from\ncollective understanding owing to\u201d (2007: 155) a gap in communal\nlinguistic/conceptual resources that is more damaging to those from a\nsocially disadvantaged group (to which one belongs). In her\nEpistemic Injustice, Fricker connects this up with issues in\nboth ethics and epistemology, especially epistemology of\ntestimony.  We discuss this more fully in 2.4, below. \n",
