Khayyam the Mathematician and Scientist\n\nAnd the part of philosophy known as mathematics is the easiest of its parts to grasp both as to conception and as to assent. As to the numerical part of it, it is a very evident matter. And as to the geometrical, likewise hardly anything of it will be unknown to someone who has an unimpaired constitution, a sharp view, an excellent intuition. (Commentary on the Difficulties of Certain Postulates of Euclid\u2019s Work, Rashed and Vahabzadeh, 2000, 217\u2013218).\n\nIn several respects Khayyam\u2019s mathematical writings are similar to his texts in other genres: they are relatively few in number, but deal with well-chosen topics and carry deep implications. Some of his mathematics relate in passing to philosophical matters (in particular, reasoning from postulates and definitions), but his most significant work deals with issues internal to mathematics and in particular the intersection between geometry and algebra.\nKhayyam\u2019s mathematical works with recent editions and publications are:\n\n\u201cTreatise on the division of a quadrant of a circle\u201d (Ris\u0101la f\u012b taqs\u012bm rub\u2018 al-d\u0101\u2018ira) in Hakim Omare Khayyam as an Algebraist, Arabic text and Persian translation in Mossaheb, 1960, 59\u201374, 251\u2013291; English translation and critical edition in Rashed and Vahabzadeh, 2000, 165\u2013180.\n\u201cTreatise on Algebra\u201d (Ris\u0101la fi\u2019l-bar\u0101h\u012bn \u2018al\u0101 mas\u0101\u2019il al-jabr wa\u2019l-muq\u0101bala) in Hakim Omare Khayyam as an Algebraist, Persian translation in Mossaheb, 1960, 159\u2013250; English translation and critical edition in Rashed and Vahabzadeh, 2000, 111\u2013164.\n\u201cCommentary on the Difficulties of Certain Postulates of Euclid\u2019s Work\u201d (Shar\u1e25 m\u0101 ashkal min mu\u1e63\u0101dir\u0101t al-uqlidis) in D\u0101nish n\u0101mah-yi Khayy\u0101m\u012b, Malik (ed.) 1377 (A.H.s.), 71\u2013112; English translation and critical edition in Rashed and Vahabzadeh, 2000, 217\u2013255.\n\u201cProblems of Arithmetic\u201d (Mushkil\u0101t al-\u1e25is\u0101b), (only the title page is extant at the University of Leiden library collection Cod. or. 199, but Khayyam references the work in his Algebra).\n\n",
