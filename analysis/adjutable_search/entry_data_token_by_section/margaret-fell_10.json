    "main_text": "Criticisms of Quaker defences of women\n5. Criticisms of Quaker defences of women\n\n\nModern critics identify several problems with describing Quaker\ndefences of women as \u201cfeminist\u201d. They point to the fact\nthat, despite their affirmations of spiritual equality, the Quakers\nstill uphold a negative conception of sexual difference, they suggest\nthat women preachers must typically transcend or efface their female\nsexuality, and they do not call for wider socio-political changes for\nwomen.\n",
