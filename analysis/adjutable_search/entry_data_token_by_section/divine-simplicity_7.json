But how is this possible if, as DDS\nimplies, God is utterly sui generis and unique in his very\nmode of uniqueness? It might not be possible at all, in which case\nsilence might be the most appropriate response. But let\u2019s not\ngive up just yet. Vallicella (1992) suggests that God is assimilable\nto a self-exemplifying property, a Platonic Form. Hughes goes\nnominalist with his idea that God is something like a singleton set.\nMann assimilates God to a property instance or trope. Hugh McCann,\nrejecting Mann\u2019s view, proposes that we think of God as a\nconcrete state of affairs. Such are to be distinguished from abstract\nstates of affairs. Contrast Booth\u2019s assassinating\nLincoln with Booth assassinating Lincoln. Both are\nstates of affairs, but only the former is concrete in the sense of\ncausally active/passive. Whereas the former is an act (act-token), the\nlatter is an act-type. The former was causally efficacious; the latter\nis disbarred from causal efficacy by its ontological category.\nMcCann\u2019s proposal, then, is that God be thought of as a concrete\nstate of affairs along the lines of Michaelangelo\u2019s creating\nof the Sistine Chapel\u2019s ceiling.\n\nThus is concretion secured, but whither simplicity? A concrete state\nof affairs such as Socrates\u2019 being pale is a complex both the\nsubject and the property constituent of which are necessary for its\nidentity. Property instance or tropes, by contrast, are simples: the\npaleness trope in Socrates, though it cannot \u2018migrate\u2019 to\nPlato, does not have Socrates as a constituent and so is not tied to\nthe philosopher for its identity. Now McCann is well aware that the\nontological complexity of concrete states of affairs does not comport\nwell with divine simplicity. But he thinks it is the best we can\ndo.\n\nAlthough McCann doesn\u2019t say it, it seems to follow from his\nwhole approach that God cannot be a member of any extant ontological\ncategory: he cannot be a universal or a set or a trope \u2026 or a\nconcrete state of affairs. Indeed, if he is absolutely sovereign, then\nGod must somehow be the creative source of the ontological categories\nthemselves, how many they are and what they are, and not merely the\nsource of the natures (essences) of the members of categories. God\nmust transcend all categories. Taken to the limit, absolute\nsovereignty would seem to imply absolute transcendence\u2014 and\nabsolute ineffability. Clearly, this is what the simplicity doctrine\nculminates in and is meant to preserve. So there is a tension here if\nnot a contradiction: it cannot be true both that God is beyond all\nontological categories and is a member of the category of concrete\nstates of affairs. But if we are to have any conception of God at all,\nwe must force him into some extant category or other, and for McCann\nthe category of concrete state of affairs is the best we can do. One\nwalks a tightrope when one attempts to avoid negative theology with\nits \u201cnothing can be said positively about God.\u201d Citing\nvarious texts of Aquinas, Eleonore Stump (2016, 195\u2013198) shows\nthat radical agnosticism about the divine nature is unwarranted. To\nknow what God is not, one must have some knowledge of what God is. The\nclaim that God is not a body, for example, rests on such affirmations\nas that God is the prime mover and is purely actual.\n",
