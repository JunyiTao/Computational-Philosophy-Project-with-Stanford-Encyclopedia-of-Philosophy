    "main_text": "Social Choice\n4. Social Choice\n\nThe theory of social choice in its modern incarnation originated in\nArrow\u2019s pioneering work. Arrow himself described it as a\n\u2018subversive\u2019 attempt to \u2018operationalize\u2019 the\nBergson-Samuelson approach (Arrow 1983, 26), but it could equally be\nviewed as extending the tradition of earlier work on voting and\ncommittee decisions, going back to Condorcet and Black. It has\ndeveloped into an immense literature, with many ramifications to a\nvariety of subfields and topics. The social choice framework is,\npotentially, so general that one may think of using it to unify\nnormative economics. In a restrictive definition, however, social\nchoice is considered to deal with the problem of synthesizing\nheterogeneous individual preferences into a consistent ranking.\nSometimes an even more restrictive notion of \u201cArrovian social\nchoice\u201d is used to name works which faithfully adopt\nArrow\u2019s particular axioms.\n\nThere are many surveys of social choice theory, in broad and\nrestrictive senses: Arrow, Sen and Suzumura (1997, in particular chap.\n3, 4, 7, 11, 15; 2002, in particular chap. 1, 2, 3, 4, 7, 10; 2011, in\nparticular chap. 13, 14, 17\u201320), Sen (1970, 1977a, 1986, 1999,\n2009), Anand, Puppe and Pattanaik (2009). See also the entry on\n social choice theory.\n",
