    "main_text": "Envy and Justice || Egalitarianism and Envy\n3.1 Egalitarianism and Envy\n\nA recurring suggestion in the history of philosophical and political\nthought has been that envy supplies the psychological foundations of\nthe concern for justice, and, especially, of egalitarian conceptions\nof\n justice.[16]\n Both the proponents of this charge and those who contest it have\ncommonly taken it to be a damaging suggestion for\n egalitarianism.[17]\n It is worth distinguishing genetic versions of the charge from\noccurrent ones. Genetic versions concern the historical or\ndevelopmental sources of a concern for equality. Freud, for instance,\nheld that concern with justice is the product of childhood envy of\nother children leading to concern for equal treatment, and thereby to\n\u2018group spirit\u2019: \u201cIf one cannot be the favorite\noneself, at all events nobody else shall be the favorite.\u201d (p.\n120). Nietzsche can be read as tendering an account of the origins of\negalitarian values or ideals in envy in his account of the\n\u201cslave revolt in\n morality.\u201d[18]\n Whatever their merits, these claims should be distinguished from the\nclaim that those who defend egalitarian views of justice are motivated\nby occurrent bouts of envy or propensities to\n them.[19]\n\nDefense of the charge that egalitarianism is occurrently motivated by\nenvy hinges both on the commitments of egalitarianism and on the\nnature of envy. The common motif is that egalitarians wish to do away\nwith the advantages of the better off, and that they wish to do this\nbecause they are bothered by the very fact that the better off are\nbetter off. This is supposed to show that egalitarians are motivated\nby envy. Whether this is a fair characterization of any prominent\negalitarian position is certainly open to\n question.[20]\n But in any case, in light of the distinction between envy and\nresentment, it is clear that there can be no direct move from the\nclaim that egalitarians are \u2018bothered\u2019 by the advantages\nof the better off to the claim that they are envious. For another\npossibility is that what they feel is resentment, occasioned by the\nthought that the present distribution is\n unjust.[21]\n Note that the claim that what is felt is resentment does not depend\nupon showing that the resentment is fitting\u2014that the\ndistribution really is unjust. It would suffice to show that the\nresponse really is a moral evaluation, justified or not.\n\nIt seems clear that the occurrent version of the charge is only\ndamaging to egalitarianism if the basic distinction between envy and\nresentment is accepted. Otherwise, envy could be granted to motivate\negalitarianism, but this would not impute any concern aside from\nconcerns with justice to the position. With the distinction in hand,\nhowever, the charge is difficult to defend. Envy does not arise in\ncases where inequalities favor the subject. So defenders of the charge\nappear to be committed to the falsifiable thesis that egalitarians are\ninconsistent in their commitment to\n inequality.[22]\n If the charge were true, egalitarians should oppose only the\ninequalities that are unfavorable to their own interests. To the\nextent that egalitarians are sincere and consistent in the embrace of\ntheir principles, this counts against the charge that their occurrent\nmotivation is\n envy.[23]\n",
