    "main_text": "The Most Prominent Pythagoreans of the Fifth and Fourth Century || Eurytus\n2.2 Eurytus\n\nIn the ancient sources, Eurytus is most frequently mentioned in the\nsame breath as Philolaus, and he is probably the student of Philolaus\n(Iamblichus, VP 148, 139). Aristoxenus (4th c. BCE) presents\nPhilolaus and Eurytus as the teachers of the last generation of\nPythagoreans (Diogenes Laertius VIII 46) and Diogenes Laertius reports\nthat Plato came to Italy to meet Philolaus and Eurytus after the death\nof Socrates (III 46). In order to be the pupil of Philolaus, who was\nborn around 470, and teach the last generation of Pythagoreans around\n400, Eurytus would need to be born between 450 and 440. The sources\nare very confused as to which S. Italian city he was from, Croton\n(Iamblichus, VP 148), Tarentum (Iamblichus, VP 267;\nDiogenes Laertius VIII 46) or Metapontum (Iamblichus, VP 266\nand 267). It may be that the Eurytus from Metapontum is a different\nEurytus. It is possible that Archytas studied with Eurytus, since\nTheophrastus (Aristotle\u2019s successor in the Lyceum) cites\nArchytas as the source for the one testimony we have about the\nphilosophy of Eurytus (Metaph. 6a 19\u201322). In the\ncatalogue of Pythagoreans at the end of Iamblichus\u2019 On the\nPythagorean Life (267), Eurytus appears between Philolaus and\nArchytas in the list of Pythagoreans from Tarentum, which may thus\nsuggest that he was regarded as the pupil of Philolaus and a teacher\nof Archytas.\n\nAccording to Theophrastus (Metaph. 6a 19\u201322), Eurytus\narranged pebbles in a certain way in order to show the number which\ndefined things in the world, such as a man or a horse. Aristotle\nrefers to the same practice (Metaph. 1092b8 ff.), and\nAlexander provides commentary on the Aristotelian passage\n(CAG I. 827.9). Aristotle introduces Eurytus as someone who\nregarded numbers as causes of substances by being the points that\nbound spatial magnitudes. He says that Eurytus made likenesses of the\nshapes of things in the natural world with pebbles and thus determined\nthe number which belongs to each thing by the number of pebbles\nrequired. Scholars often treat Eurytus\u2019 procedure as puerile and\nhave sometimes not taken him seriously (Kahn 2001, 33), or suggested\nthat Theophrastus is ironical in his presentation (e.g., Zhmud 2012,\n410\u2013411). There is, however, no obvious irony in\nTheophrastus\u2019 remarks. He, in fact, presents Eurytus very\npositively as someone who showed in detail how specific parts of the\ncosmos arose out of basic principles, in contrast to other thinkers,\nwho posit basic principles but do not go very far in explaining how\nthe world arises from those principles. This positive presentation may\nreflect Theophrastus\u2019 source, Archytas, who perhaps saw Eurytus\nas attempting to carry out Philolaus\u2019 project of determining the\nnumbers that give us knowledge of things in the world (Huffman 2005,\n55; see also Netz 2014, 173\u2013178).\n\nHow are we, then, to understand Eurytus\u2019 procedure? It does not\nseem plausible to suppose that he simply drew a picture or an outline\ndrawing of a man or a horse and then counted the number of pebbles\nrequired to make the outline (Riedweg 2005, 86) or fill in the\npicture, since the number would vary with the size of the drawing and\nthe size of the pebbles. A large picture of a man would require many\nmore pebbles than a small one, so that it would seem arbitrary which\nnumber to associate with man. This interpretation treats Eurytus as a\nmosaicist and is largely derived from Alexander\u2019s testimony.\nAristotle\u2019s presentation supports another interpretation. He\ndraws a parallel with those who arrange numbers of pebbles into\nshapes, such as a triangle or a square. This suggests that Eurytus had\nobserved that, e.g., any three points in a plane determine a triangle\nand any four a quadrilateral. He may then have drawn the general\nconclusion that any shape or structure was determined by a unique\nnumber of points and tried to represent these by setting out the\nnecessary number of pebbles. Thus, the complex structure of a\nthree-dimensional object such as the human body would require a large\nnumber of points, but the number of points required to determine a\nhuman being could be expected to be unique and to differ from the\nnumber that determined any other object in the natural world, such as\na horse (Kirk and Raven 1957, 313 ff.; Guthrie 1962, 273 ff.; Barnes\n1982, 390\u2013391; Cambiano 1998). It is important to note that\nnothing in these reports suggests that Eurytus thought that things\nwere composed of numbers or that he regarded the points that defined a\ngiven thing as atoms of which things were made, as has sometimes been\nsupposed (Cornford 1922\u20131923, 10\u201311). Instead, he is best\nunderstood as making a bold attempt to show that the structure of all\nthings is determined by number and thus to provide specifics for\nPhilolaus\u2019 general thesis that all things are known through\nnumber. Another approach is to argue that no reference is being made\nto creating a picture out of pebbles. The pebbles refer instead to\ncounters on an abacus, which the Greeks used for calculations. In this\ncase Eurytus can be supposed to have started by identifying certain\nbasic numerical properties with features of the world and then\nderiving the number of man or horse through calculations using the\nabacus (Netz 2014, 173\u2013178).\n",
