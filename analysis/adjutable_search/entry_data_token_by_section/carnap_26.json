    "main_text": "Final Years and Legacy\n9. Final Years and Legacy\n\nIn 1951, Herbert Feigl approached Paul Schilpp, the editor of the\nLibrary of Living Philosophers, about doing a volume not on a\nparticular philosopher, but on logical empiricism as a movement.\nCarnap and Reichenbach were to be in the foreground, as representative\nfigures for the movement as a whole. Schilpp was sufficiently\ninterested that he persisted with the idea even after\nReichenbach\u2019s sudden death in 1953; the volume was now to be\nfocused on Carnap alone. Carnap invested a great deal of time in the\nproject. He took the task of writing an autobiography seriously,\nreviewing many of his old papers, including his extensive diaries, in\npreparation for it. The resulting autobiography was much too long, and\nhad to be cut by a third before publication. (The cut portions are\navailable at the Young Research Library, University of California at\nLos Angeles, Special Collections, Collection 1029 (Rudolf Carnap), Box\n2, CM3, mostly in folder marked \u201cM-A5\u201d; extensive\nquotations and references can be found in Carus 2007a.)\n\nUnfortunately, publication was delayed by a series of mishaps, and\nwhen the book finally appeared in 1963, logical empiricism was no\nlonger at the forefront of interest. Analytic philosophers had largely\nbeen swayed by Quine\u2019s critique of Carnap over the past decade,\nand philosophers of science were captivated by Thomas Kuhn\u2019s\nbook The Structure of Scientific Revolutions, published the\nyear before in the International Encyclopedia of Unified Science,\nco-edited by Carnap. Logical empiricism no longer inspired passions,\neither for or against; it seemed to belong to the past. Carnap saw in\nthe anti-war and student movements of the 1960s an American version of\nthe Youth Movement that had played such an important role in his own\ndevelopment half a century earlier, but insofar as the students of the\n1960s were interested in philosophy, it was not in logical empiricism.\nA few weeks before his death, Carnap prepared a report for an American\nPhilosophical Association committee about his meeting in the summer of\n1970 with some philosophers imprisoned in Mexico. It illustrates his\ncontinued interest in social and political matters and in his fellow\nphilosophers, and appeared posthumously, in December of that year, in\nthe Journal of Philosophy. When Carnap died in Los Angeles in\n1970, the philosophical world at large (as opposed to the major\nfigures whose views he had shaped, such as Quine, Goodman, Putnam,\nJeffrey, or Stein) had lost interest in him. But half a century later,\nit is fair to say that Carnap\u2019s work is as much in the\nforeground of philosophical discussion as it has ever been.\n",
