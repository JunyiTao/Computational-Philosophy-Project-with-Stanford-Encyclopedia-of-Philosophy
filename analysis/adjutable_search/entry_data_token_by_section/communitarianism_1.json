    "main_text": "The Debate Over the Self\n2. The Debate Over the Self\n\nCommunitarian thinkers in the 1980s such as Michael Sandel and Charles\nTaylor argued that Rawlsian liberalism rests on an overly\nindividualistic conception of the self. Whereas Rawls argues that we\nhave a supreme interest in shaping, pursuing, and revising our own\nlife-plans, he neglects the fact that our selves tend to be defined or\nconstituted by various communal attachments (e.g., ties to the family\nor to a religious tradition) so close to us that they can only be set\naside at great cost, if at all. This insight led to the view that\npolitics should not be concerned solely with securing the conditions\nfor individuals to exercise their powers of autonomous choice, as we\nalso need to sustain and promote the social attachments crucial to our\nsense of well-being and respect, many of which have been involuntarily\npicked up during the course of our upbringing. First, however, let us\nreview the ontological or metaphysical debate over the self that led\nto this political conclusion. \n\nIn an influential essay titled \u201cAtomism\u201d, Charles Taylor\nobjected to the liberal view that \u201cmen are self-sufficient\noutside of society\u201d. (Taylor 1985, 2000) Instead, Taylor defends\nthe Aristotelian view that \u201cMan is a social animal, indeed a\npolitical animal, because he is not self-sufficient alone, and in an\nimportant sense is not self-sufficient outside a polis\u201d (Taylor\n1985, 190). Moreover, this atomistic view of the self can undermine\nliberal society, because it fails to grasp the extent to which\nliberalism presumes a context where individuals are members of, and\ncommitted to, a society that promotes particular values such as\nfreedom and individual diversity. Fortunately, most people in liberal\nsocieties do not really view themselves as atomistic selves.\n\nBut do liberal thinkers actually defend the idea that the self is\ncreated ex-nihilo, outside of any social context and that\nhumans can exist (and flourish) independently of all social contexts?\nIn fact, Taylor\u2019s essay was directed at the libertarian thinker\nRobert Nozick. As it turns out, the communitarian critique of the\natomistic self does not apply to Rawslian liberalism: in Part III of\nTheory of Justice, Rawls pays close attention to the\npsychological and social conditions that facilitate the formation of\nliberal selves committed to justice. But few readers ever got to Part\nIII of Rawls\u2019 massive tome, so communitarians got quite a bit of\nmileage from their critique of liberal atomism. This charge\ndidn\u2019t stick, however.\n\nWhile liberals may not have been arguing that individuals can\ncompletely extricate themselves from their social context,\nthe liberal valuation of choice still seemed to suggest an image of a\nsubject who impinges his will on the\n world.[9]\n Drawing on the insights of Heidegger and Wittgenstein, communitarians\nargued that this view neglects the extent to which individuals are\nembodied agents in the world. Far from acting in ways designed to\nrealize an autonomously arrived-at life-plan, vast areas of our lives\nare in fact governed by unchosen routines and habits that lie in the\nbackground. More often than not we act in ways specified by our social\nbackground when we walk, dress, play games, speak, and so on without\nhaving formulated any goals or made any choices. It is only when\nthings break down from the normal, everyday, unchosen mode of\nexistence that we think of ourselves as subjects dealing with an\nexternal world, having the experience of formulating various ways of\nexecuting our goals, choosing from among those ways, and accepting\nresponsibility for the outcomes of our actions. In other words,\ntraditional intentionality is introduced at the point that our\nordinary way of coping with things is insufficient. Yet this breakdown\nmode is what we tend to notice, and philosophers have therefore argued\nthat most of our actions are occasioned by processes of reflection.\nLiberals have picked up this mistaken assumption, positing the idea of\na subject who seeks to realize an autonomously arrived-at life-plan,\nlosing sight of the fact that critical reflection upon one\u2019s\nends is nothing more than one possibility that arises when our\nordinary ways of coping with things is insufficient to get things\ndone.\n\nSome liberals have replied by recognizing the point that vast areas of\nour lives are governed by unchosen habits and routines, that the\ndeliberate, effortful, choosing subject mode may be the exception\nrather than the rule. They emphasize, however, that the main\njustification for a liberal politics concerned primarily with securing\nthe conditions for individuals to lead autonomous lives rests on the\npossibility and desirability of normative self-determination,\nthat is, on the importance of making choices with respect to things\nthat we value (Doppelt 1989). While it may be true that\ncertain communal practices often, or even mostly, guide our behavior\nbehind our backs, it doesn\u2019t follow that those practices ought\nto be valued, or reflectively endorsed in non-ordinary moments of\nexistence, much less that the government ought somehow to promote\nthese practices. And what liberals care about ultimately is the\nprovision of the rights, powers, and opportunities that individuals\nneed to develop and implement their own conceptions of the good\nlife.\n\nThis qualified version of the liberal self, however, still seems to\nimply that moral outlooks are, or should be, the product of individual\nchoice. One\u2019s social world, communitarians can reply, provides\nmore than non-moral social practices like table manners and\npronunciation norms\u2014it also provides some sort of orientation in\nmoral space. We cannot make sense of our moral experience\nunless we situate ourselves within this given moral space, within the\nauthoritative moral horizons. What Charles Taylor calls \u201chigher,\nstrongly evaluated goods\u201d (Taylor 1989)\u2014the goods we\nshould feel committed to, those that generate moral obligations on us\nregardless of our actual preferences are not somehow invented by\nindividuals, but rather they are located within the social world which\nprovides one\u2019s framework of the lower and the higher. Thus, the\nliberal ideal of a self who freely invents her own moral outlook, or\nprivate conception of the good, cannot do justice to our actual moral\nexperience.\n\nBut once again, liberals need not deny the assumption that our social\nworld provides a framework of the higher and the lower nor need it be\npresumed that we must regard our own moral outlook as freely invented.\nWill Kymlicka, for example, explicitly recognizes that things have\nworth for us in so far as they are granted significance by our\nculture, in so far as they fit into a pattern of activities which is\nrecognized by those sharing a certain form of life as a way of leading\na good life (Kymlicka 1989, 166). That one\u2019s social world\nprovides the range of things worth doing, achieving, or being does\nnot, however, undermine the liberal emphasis on autonomy, for there is\nstill substantial room for individual choice to be made within this\nset. The best life is still the one where the individual\nchooses what is worth doing, achieving, or being, though it\nmay be that this choice has to be made within a certain framework\nwhich is itself unchosen.\n\nCommunitarians can reply by casting doubt on the view that choice is\nintrinsically valuable, that a certain moral principle or\ncommunal attachment is more valuable simply because it has been chosen\nfollowing deliberation among alternatives by an individual subject. If\nwe have a highest-order interest in choosing our central projects and\nlife-plans, regardless of what is chosen, it ought to follow that\nthere is something fundamentally wrong with unchosen attachments and\nprojects. But this view violates our actual self-understandings. We\nordinarily think of ourselves, Michael Sandel says, \u201cas members\nof this family or community or nation or people, as bearers of this\nhistory, as sons or daughters of that revolution, as citizens of this\nrepublic\u201d, (Sandel 1981, 179) social attachments that more often\nthan not are involuntarily picked up during the course of our\nupbringing, rational choice having played no role whatsoever. I\ndidn\u2019t choose to love my mother and father, to care about the\nneighborhood in which I grew up, to have special feelings for the\npeople of my country, and it is difficult to understand why anyone\nwould think I have chosen these attachments, or that I ought to have\ndone so. In fact, there may even be something distasteful about\nsomeone who questions the things he or she deeply cares\nabout\u2014certainly no marriage could survive too long if\nfundamental understandings regarding love and trust were constantly\nthrown open for discussion! Nor is it obvious that, say, someone who\nperforms a good deed following prolonged calculation of pros and cons\nis morally superior than a Mother-Teresa type who unreflectively,\nspontaneously acts on behalf of other people\u2019s interests.\n\nLiberals can reply that the real issue is not the desirability of\nchoice, but rather the possibility of choice. There may well\nbe some unchosen attachments that need not be critically reflected\nupon and endorsed, and it may even be the case that excessive\ndeliberation about the things we care about can occasionally be\ncounter-productive. But some of our ends may be problematic and that\nis why we have a fundamental interest in being able to question and\nrevise them. Most important is not choosing our own life-plans;\nrather, liberalism founded on the value of self-determination requires\nonly that we be able to critically evaluate our ends if need\nbe, hence that \u201cno end or goal is exempt from possible\nre-examination\u201d (Kymlicka 1989, 52; Dworkin 1989, 489; Macedo\n1990, 247). For example, an oppressed woman has a fundamental interest\nin being able to critically reflect upon traditional understandings of\nwhat it means to be a good wife and mother, and it would be unjust to\nforeclose her freedom to radically revise her plans.\n\nThis response, however, still leaves open the possibility of a deep\nchallenge to liberal foundations. Perhaps we are able to reexamine\nsome attachments, but the problem for liberalism arises if there are\nothers so fundamental to our identity that they cannot be set aside,\nand that any attempt to do so will result in serious and perhaps\nirreparable psychological damage. In fact, this challenge to\nliberalism would only require that communitarians be able to identify\none end or communal attachment so constitutive of one\u2019s identity\nthat it cannot be revised and rejected. A psychoanalyst, for example,\nmay want to argue that (at least in some cases) it is impossible to\nchoose to shed the attachment one feels for one\u2019s mother, and\nthat an attempt may lead to perverse and unintended consequences. A\nfeminist theorist may point to the mother-child relationship as an\nexample of a constitutive feature of one\u2019s identity and argue\nthat any attempt to deny this fails to be sensitive to women\u2019s\nspecial needs and experiences (Frazer & Lacey 1993, 53\u201360).\nAn anthropologist may argue on the basis of field observations that it\nis impossible for an Inuit person from Canada\u2019s far north to\nsuddenly decide to stop being an Inuit and that the only sensible\nresponse is to recognize and accept this constitutive feature of his\nidentity. Or a gay liberation activist may claim that it is both\nimpossible and undesirable for gays to repress their\nbiologically-given sexual identity. These arguments are not\nimplausible, and they seem to challenge the liberal view that no\nparticular end or commitment should be beyond critical reflection and\nopen to revision.\n\nLet us assume, for the sake of argument, that we can identify one\nparticular attachment so deeply-embedded that it is impossible to\nreally bring to conscious awareness and so significant for one\u2019s\nwell-being that an individual can only forsake commitment to its good\nat the cost of being seriously psychologically disturbed. This end is\nbeyond willed change and one loses a commitment to it at the price of\nbeing thrown into a state of disorientation where one is unable to\ntake a stand on many things of significance (Taylor 1989, 26\u20137).\nDoes this really threaten liberal politics? It may, if liberal\npolitics really rests on the liberal self. Fortunately, that is not\nthe case. Rereading some of the communitarian texts from the 1980s,\nthere seems to have been an assumption that once you expose faulty\nfoundations regarding the liberal self, the whole liberal edifice will\ncome tumbling down. The task is to criticize the underlying philosophy\nof the self, win people on your side, and then we can move on to a\nbrand new communitarian society that owes nothing to the liberal\ntradition. This must have been an exhilarating time for would-be\nrevolutionaries, but more level-headed communitarians soon realized\nthat overthrowing liberal rights was never part of the agenda. Even if\nliberals are wrong to deny the existence of constitutive\nends\u2014even if the philosophical justifications for a liberal form\nof social organization founded on the value of reflective choice are\nrotten to the core\u2014there are still many, relatively pragmatic\nreasons for caring about rights in the modern world. To name some of\nthe more obvious benefits, liberal rights often contribute to\nsecurity, political stability and economic modernization.\n\nIn short, the whole debate about the self appears to have been\nsomewhat misconceived. Liberals were wrong to think they needed to\nprovide iron-clad philosophies of the self to justify liberal\npolitics, and communitarians were wrong to think that challenging\nthose foundations was sufficient to undermine liberal politics. Not\nsurprisingly, both sides soon got tired of debating the pros and cons\nof the liberal self. By the early 1990s, this liberal-communitarian\ndebate over the self had effectively faded from view in Anglo-American\n philosophy.[10]\n\nSo what remains of the communitarian conception of the self? What may\nbe distinctive about communitarians is that they are more inclined to\nargue that individuals have a vital interest in leading decent\ncommunal lives, with the political implication that there may be a\nneed to sustain and promote the communal attachments crucial to our\nsense of well-being. This is not necessarily meant to challenge the\nliberal view that some of our communal attachments can be problematic\nand may need to be changed, thus that the state needs to protect our\npowers to shape, pursue, and revise our own life-plans. But our\ninterest in community may occasionally conflict with our other vital\ninterest in leading freely chosen lives, and the communitarian view is\nthat the latter does not automatically trump the former in cases of\nconflict. On the continuum between freedom and community,\ncommunitarians are more inclined to draw the line towards the\nlatter.\n\nBut these conflicts cannot be resolved in the abstract. Much turns on\nempirical analyses of actual politics\u2014to what extent our\ninterest in community is indeed threatened by excess liberal politics,\nto what extent the state can play a role in remedying the situation,\nto what extent the nourishment of communal ties should be left to\ncivil society, and so on. This is where the political communitarians\nof the last decade have shed some light. Let us now turn to the\npolitics of community, the third major strand of the communitarian\nthought.\n",
