    "main_text": "Voltaire\u2019s Enlightenment Philosophy || Newtonian Empirical Science\n2.5 Toward Science without Metaphysics\nVoltaire also contributed directly to the new relationship between science and philosophy that the Newtonian revolution made central to Enlightenment modernity. Especially important was his critique of metaphysics and his argument that it be eliminated from any well-ordered science. At the center of the Newtonian innovations in natural philosophy was the argument that questions of body per se were either irrelevant to, or distracting from, a well focused natural science. Against Leibniz, for example, who insisted that all physics begin with an accurate and comprehensive conception of the nature of bodies as such, Newton argued that the character of bodies was irrelevant to physics since this science should restrict itself to a quantified description of empirical effects only and resist the urge to speculate about that which cannot be seen or measured. This removal of metaphysics from physics was central to the overall Newtonian stance toward science, but no one fought more vigorously for it, or did more to clarify the distinction and give it a public audience than Voltaire.\nThe battles with Leibnizianism in the 1740s were the great theater for Voltaire\u2019s work in this regard. In 1740, responding to Du Ch\u00e2telet\u2019s efforts in her Institutions de physiques to reconnect metaphysics and physics through a synthesis of Leibniz with Newton, Voltaire made his opposition to such a project explicit in reviews and other essays he published. He did the same during the brief revival of the so-called \u201cvis viva controversy\u201d triggered by du Ch\u00e2telet\u2019s treatise, defending the empirical and mechanical conception of body and force against those who defended Leibniz\u2019s more metaphysical conception of the same thing. In the same period, Voltaire also composed a short book entitled La Metaphysique de Newton, publishing it in 1740 as an implicit counterpoint to Ch\u00e2telet\u2019s Institutions. This tract did not so much articulate Newton\u2019s metaphysics as celebrate the fact that he avoided practicing such speculations altogether. It also accused Leibniz of becoming deluded by his zeal to make metaphysics the foundation of physics. In the definitive 1745 edition of his \u00c9l\u00e9ments de la philosophie de Newton, Voltaire also appended his tract on Newton\u2019s metaphysics as the book\u2019s introduction, thus framing his own understanding of the relationship between metaphysics and empirical science in direct opposition to Ch\u00e2telet\u2019s Leibnizian understanding of the same. He also added personal invective and satire to this same position in his indictment of Maupertuis in the 1750s, linking Maupertuis\u2019s turn toward metaphysical approaches to physics in the 1740s with his increasingly deluded philosophical understanding and his authoritarian manner of dealing with his colleagues and critics.\nWhile Voltaire\u2019s attacks on Maupertuis crossed the line into ad hominem, at their core was a fierce defense of the way that metaphysical reasoning both occludes and deludes the work of the physical scientist. Moreover, to the extent that eighteenth-century Newtonianism provoked two major trends in later philosophy, first the reconstitution of transcendental philosophy \u00e0 la Kant through his \u201cCopernican Revolution\u201d that relocated the remains of metaphysics in the a priori categories of reason, and second, the marginalization of metaphysics altogether through the celebration of philosophical positivism and the anti-speculative scientific method that anchored it, Voltaire should be seen as a major progenitor of the latter. By also attaching what many in the nineteenth century saw as Voltaire\u2019s proto-positivism to his celebrated campaigns to eradicate priestly and aristo-monarchical authority through the debunking of the \u201cirrational superstitions\u201d that appeared to anchor such authority, Voltaire\u2019s legacy also cemented the alleged linkage that joined positivist science on the one hand with secularizing disenchantment and dechristianization on the other. In this way, Voltaire should be seen as the initiator of a philosophical tradition that runs from him to Auguste Comte and Charles Darwin, and then on to Karl Popper and Richard Dawkins in the twentieth century.\n",
