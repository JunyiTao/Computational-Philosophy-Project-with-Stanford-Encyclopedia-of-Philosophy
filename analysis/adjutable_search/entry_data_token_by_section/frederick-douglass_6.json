    "main_text": "Universal Human Brotherhood\n7. Universal Human Brotherhood\n\nDouglass\u2019s conception of providence, with its American themes of\nindividualism, anti-supernaturalism, and activism, and his view of\nnatural law influenced his understanding of universal human\nbrotherhood (Sundstrom 2003 and 2008: 11\u201335). He believed that\nthe idea of universal human brotherhood was consistent with the high\nideals of American Republicanism and Christianity. It was a doctrine\ndearly held by Douglass, and he offered it as a response to the rise\nin the United States of Samuel Morton\u2019s (1799\u20131851) racial\ntheory of polygenesis, that Josiah Nott and George\nGliddon\u2019s Types of Mankind (1854) popularized (Martin\n1984; Myers 2008).\n\nDouglass put considerable effort into countering arguments that blacks\nwere subhuman, intellectually and morally inferior, and fit to be\ndominated as children, forever to be a race in nonage. To counter\nthese claims, he turned to his natural law arguments. He argued that\nby the standards of Christian theology, blacks, as humans and\ncreations of the divine, were all equally the children of God, no\nmatter their present condition. One of his slogans, drawn directly\nfrom the title of a poem by the Scottish poet Robert Burns, got to the\npoint: \u201cA man\u2019s a man for a\u2019 that\u201d\n (1795).[22]\n Douglass argued that the Christian Bible had to be correct on this\nscore, that the authority of the biblical text relied on the\naffirmation of the unity of the human family:\n\n\nWhat, after all, if they are able to show very good reasons for\nbelieving the Negro to have been created precisely as we find him on\nthe Gold Coast\u2014along the Senegal and the Niger\u2014I say, what\nof all this?\u2014\u201cA man\u2019s a man for a\u2019\nthat\u201d. I sincerely believe, that the weight of the argument\nis in favor of the unity of origin of the human race, or\nspecies\u2014that the arguments on the other side are partial,\nsuperficial, utterly subversive of the happiness of man, and insulting\nto the wisdom of God. Yet, what if we grant they are not so? What, if\nwe grant that the case, on our part, is not made out? Does it follow,\nthat the Negro should be held in contempt? Does it follow, that to\nenslave and imbrue him is either just or wise? I\nthink not. Human rights stand upon a common basis; and by all the\nreason that they are supported, maintained and defended, for one\nvariety of the human family, they are supported, maintained and\ndefended for all the human family; because all mankind have\nthe same wants, arising out of a common nature. A diverse origin does\nnot disprove a common nature, nor does it disprove a united destiny.\n(1854 [SFD: 147] [FDP1 v.2: 523])\n\n\nHe emphasized that not only was slavery against natural law and\nChristian morality but that the very arguments concerning the subhuman\nstatus of blacks that slavery\u2019s apologists used to justify\nattempted slavery contradicted the Bible and were heretical. Douglass,\nin short, leveraged the Bible and America\u2019s reverence for it\nagainst the rising tide of polygenesis race theory. He stated:\n\n\nThe unity of the human race\u2014the brotherhood of man\u2014the\nreciprocal duties of all to each, and of each to all, are too plainly\ntaught in the Bible to admit of cavil.\u2014The credit of the Bible\nis at stake\u2014and if it be too much to say, that it must stand or\nfall, by the decision of this question, it is proper to say,\nthat the value of that sacred Book\u2014as a record of the early\nhistory of mankind\u2014must be materially affected, by the decision\nof the question. (1854 [SFD: 126] [FDP1 v.2: 505])\n\n\nThe doctrine of universal human brotherhood for Douglass, and the\nabolitionists, was based on the Bible\u2019s creation story and Acts\n17:26 [KJV]: \u201cAnd hath made of one blood all nations of men for\nto dwell on all the face of the earth\u201d.\n\nThese words were not mere words for Douglass and the abolitionists;\nthey were not just-so stories. The Christian doctrine of the unity of\nthe human family or human brotherhood contained the world-historical\ninsight of equal human dignity, which implied\u2014unleashed, as seen\nin several revolutions in the eighteenth and nineteenth\ncenturies\u2014an uncompromising demand for moral equality and equal\nliberty.\n",
