A direct method takes sentential information from\nsome reliable source, such as word sense glosses in WordNet or\ndescriptive and narrative text in encyclopedias such as Wikipedia, and\nmaps this information into a (more) formal syntax for expressing\ngeneric knowledge. Indirect methods abstract (more or less) formal\ngeneric knowledge from the patterns of language found in miscellaneous\nreports, stories, essays, weblogs, etc.\nReliably extracting knowledge by the direct method requires\nrelatively deep language understanding, and consequently is far from a\nmature technology. Ide and V\u00e9ronis (1994) provide a survey of early\nwork on deriving knowledge from dictionary definitions, and the\ndifficulties faced by that enterprise. For the most part knowledge\nobtained in this way to date has been either low in quantity or in\nquality (from an inference perspective). More recent work that shows\npromise is that of Moldovan and Rus (2001), aimed at interpreting\nWordNet glosses for nominal artifact concepts, and that of Allen et\nal. (2013), aimed at forming logical theories of small clusters of\nrelated verbs (e.g., sleeping, waking up, etc.) by\ninterpreting their WordNet glosses.\nThe most actively researched approach to knowledge extraction from\ntext in the last two decades has been the indirect one, beginning with\na paper by Marti Hearst demonstrating that hyponymy relations could be\nrather simply and effectively discovered by the use of lexicosyntactic\nextraction patterns (Hearst 1992). For example, extraction patterns\nthat look for noun phrases separated by \u201csuch as\u201d or\n\u201cand other\u201d will match word sequences like \u201cseabirds\nsuch as penguins and albatrosses\u201d or \u201cbeans, nuts, and\nother legumes\u201d, leading to hypotheses that\nseabird is a hypernym of penguin and\nalbatross, and that beans and nuts are\nhyponyms of legumes.  By looking for known hyponym-hypernym\npairs in close proximity, Hearst was able to expand the initial set of\nextraction patterns and hence the set of hypotheses. Many variants\nhave been developed since then, with improvements such as automation\nof the bootstrapping and pattern discovery methods, often with machine\nlearning techniques applied to selection, weighting and combination of\nlocal features in the immediate vicinity of the relata of\ninterest. Relations other than hyponymy that have been targeted, of\nrelevance to language understanding, include part-of relations, causal\nrelations, and telic relations  (such as that the use of\nmilk is to drink it).  \nWhile knowledge extraction using Hearst-like patterns is narrowly\naimed at certain predetermined types of knowledge, other approaches\nare aimed at open information extraction (OIE).  These seek to\ndiscover a broad range of relational knowledge, in some cases\nincluding entailments (in a rather loose sense) between different\nrelations. An early and quite successful system of this genre was Lin\nand Pantel's DIRT system (Discovery of Inference Rules from Text),\nwhich used collocational statistics to build up a database of\n\u201cinference rules\u201d (Lin and Pantel 2001). An example of a\nrule might be \u201cX finds a solution to Y\n\u2248 X solves Y.\u201d The statistical techniques\nused included clustering of nominals into similarity groups based on\ntheir tendency to occur in the same argument positions of the same\nverbs, and finding similar relational phrases (such as \u201cfinds a\nsolution to\u201d and \u201csolves\u201d), based their tendency to\nconnect the same, or similar, pairs of nominals. Many of the rules\nwere later refined by addition of type constraints to the variables,\nobtained by abstracting from particular nominals via WordNet (Pantel\net al.  2007).  \nAn approach to OIE designed for maximum speed is exemplified by the\nTextRunner system (Banko et al. 2007).  TextRunner is\nextraction pattern-based, but rather than employing patterns tuned to\na few selected relations, it uses a range of patterns obtained\nautomatically from a syntactically parsed training corpus, weighted\nvia Bayesian machine learning methods to extract miscellaneous\nrelations sentence-by-sentence from text. A rather different approach,\ntermed \u201copen knowledge extraction\u201d (OKE), derives logical forms from\nparsed sentences, and simplifies and abstracts these so that they will\ntend to reflect general properties of the world. This is exemplified\nby the Knext system (KNowledge EXtraction from Text)\n(e.g., Schubert and Tong 2003). For example, the sentence \n\u201cI read a very informative book about China\u201d allows KNEXT to abstract\n\u201cfactoids\u201d to the effect that a person may occasionally read a book,\nand that books may occasionally be informative, and may occasionally\nbe about a country. (Note that the specific references to the speaker\nand China have been abstracted to classes.) Another interesting\ndevelopment has been the extraction of script-like sequences of\nrelations from large corpora by collocational methods (see Chambers\nand Jurafsky 2009). For example, the numerous newswire reports about\narrest and prosecution of criminals can be mined to abstract typical\nevent types involved, in chronological order, such as arrest,\narraignment, plea, trial, and so on. A difficulty in all of this work\nis that most of the knowledge obtained is too ambiguously and\nincompletely formulated to provide a basis for inference chaining (but\nsee for example Van Durme et al. 2009; Gordon and Schubert\n2010; Schoenmackers et al. 2010).\n",
