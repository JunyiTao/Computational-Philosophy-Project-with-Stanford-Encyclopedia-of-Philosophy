Contextualism vs. Invariantism\n\nA question that has received increasing attention in recent years is\nwhether causation is an \u2018invariant\u2019 relation or whether,\ninstead, the truth of a given causal claim varies according to the\ncontext within which it is under discussion. (Note that\n\u2018invariant\u2019 is often used to describe a causal\nrelationship that is stable across a wide range of different\ncircumstances; this is not the meaning of \u2018invariant\u2019 as\nit is being used here.) There is a wealth of evidence that\npeople\u2019s causal judgements are sensitive to contextual factors\n(Hilton & Slugoski 1986; Cheng & Novick 1991; Knobe &\nFraser 2008; Hitchcock & Knobe 2009; Clarke et al. 2015; Kominsky\net al. 2015; Icard et al. 2017); however, in principle one might hold\nthe invariantist line and insist that what varies with context is not\ntruth but merely assertibility.\n\nConsider a standard problem case: the gardener and the Queen equally\nfail to water my flowers while I\u2019m on holiday, and their\nsubsequent death (e) counterfactually depends equally on their\nomissions. But many people\u2019s judgement is that only the\ngardener\u2019s \u2013 and not the Queen\u2019s \u2013 omission is\na genuine cause of their death (Beebee 2004b, McGrath 2005, Livengood\n& Machery 2007). We might accommodate that judgement by claiming\nthat it is false that the Queen\u2019s omission was a cause of\ne, and conclude that we need some additional constraint on\ncausation aside from counterfactual dependence, e.g. that causes must\nbe \u2018deviant\u2019 or abnormal: the gardener\u2019s behaviour\nwas deviant (he was supposed to, or perhaps normally does, water my\nflowers) but the Queen\u2019s was entirely normal (she never waters\nmy flowers, nor would anyone expect her to). Or we might accommodate\nthe judgement by appealing to pragmatic factors such as salience: the\ngardener\u2019s and the Queen\u2019s omissions are both, equally,\ncauses of e, but in most conversational contexts the\nQueen\u2019s omission simply isn\u2019t relevant. For example, if\nI\u2019m interested in finding out who is to blame for the\nflowers\u2019 death, the Queen\u2019s neglect is simply irrelevant\nto my investigation since it\u2019s obvious that she is not to\nblame.\n\nLewis himself takes this latter, invariantist approach (Lewis 2004b).\nThe causes of any given event are many and varied, and in any given\nexplanatory context most of them fail to be salient; that is why it\nstrikes us as wrong to mention them (Lewis 1986d). Lewis\u2019s\napproach is to explain (some of) the phenomena that motivate\ncontextualism by appealing to a broadly Gricean story about\nconversational implicature. An advantage of invariantism is that it\nallows us to conceive of causation as a fully objective,\nmind-independent \u2013 or, as Menzies (2009: 342) puts it, a\n\u2018natural\u2019 \u2013 relation.\n\nIt is unclear, however, that all alleged cases of context-dependence\ncan be dealt with in this manner. Suzy\u2019s theft of the coconut\ncake from the shop caused her subsequent illness: having bought the\ncake, she ate it \u2013 but (as she soon discovered) she\u2019s\nallergic to coconut. Or did it? It depends, it would seem, on what we\ncontrast her theft of the coconut cake with. If she\u2019d left the\nshop empty-handed \u2013 or stolen a Bath bun instead \u2013 she\nwouldn\u2019t have been ill. But if she\u2019d paid for the cake\ninstead of stealing it, she still would have been ill. We sometimes\nmark the intended contrast by, for example, stress: Suzy\u2019s theft\nof the coconut cake caused her illness, but her theft of\nthe coconut cake didn\u2019t.\n\nLewis\u2019s original theory of events (1986b) was tailor-made to\ndeal with such cases \u2013 or so it might seem. According to that\ntheory, an event is a set of spatio-temporal regions of worlds. We can\ndistinguish between, for example, the event that is essentially\nSuzy\u2019s theft of a cake (e1) and the event that\nis essentially her acquiring (one way or another) a coconut cake\n(e2): the two events consist in two different (but\noverlapping) sets of spatio-temporal regions of worlds that share\ntheir actual-world member, namely what actually happened in the cake\nshop. And so \u2013 at least on the face of it \u2013 we can say\nthat e2 was a cause of her illness but\ne1 was not (since had she not stolen a cake, she\nwould have bought the coconut cake instead).\n\nIt is unclear, however, that appeal to the essential features of\nevents successfully deals with the problem. After all, what if, had\nSuzy not stolen a cake, the cake she would have bought was a Bath bun\nand not the coconut cake she actually stole? (She really wanted a cake\nbut didn\u2019t have enough money for the coconut cake.) And in any case,\nLewis\u2019s own official view is that in supposing a putative cause\nc absent we \u2018imagine that c is completely and cleanly\nexcised from history, leaving behind no fragment or approximation of\nitself\u2019 (2004a: 90). So we don\u2019t appear to be able to recover the\ntruth of the claim that Suzy\u2019s theft of the cake was not a\ncause of her subsequent illness. Moreover, Lewis\u2019s 2000 theory of\ncausation as influence abandons the distinction between the essences\nof events to which the above response appealed: we have various\nalterations of the theft of the coconut cake (c) \u2013\nincluding the purchase of a coconut cake and the theft of a Bath bun,\nfor example \u2013 some of which would have resulted in an alteration\nof the effect e (Suzy\u2019s illness) and some of which would not\nhave. The degree of influence of c on e either is or is\nnot sufficient to make it the case that c was a cause of\ne; either way, \u2018Suzy\u2019s theft of the coconut cake was a\ncause of her illness\u2019 comes out either true or false\nindependently of context, which \u2013 according to the contextualist\n\u2013 is the wrong result. (The invariantist, however, might insist\nthat there is no real problem here. \u2018Because she stole a coconut\ncake\u2019 would be an inappropriate response to the question\n\u2018Why is Suzy ill?\u2019 if the request comes from the doctor,\nwho is not interested in how she procured the cake; but it would be an\nappropriate response in the context of a discussion about, say, Suzy\ngetting her comeuppance from her shoplifting habit.)\n\nCei Maslen (2004), Jonathan Schaffer (2005) and Robert Northcott\n(2008) all defend \u2018contrastive\u2019 accounts of causation. Schaffer\nconceives causation as a four-place relation \u2013 c rather\nthan c* caused e rather than e* \u2013 and\nclaims that context (or other devices, such as stress on a particular\nword) generally fixes the implied contrasts (c* and e*)\nin our ordinary, two-place causal talk, thereby playing a role in the\ntruth or falsity of our (two-place) causal claims. Note that\ncontrastivism about causation is a distinct position from the view\nthat explanations are (always or sometimes) contrastive (see e.g.\nLewis 1986d, \u00a7VI; Lipton 1991; Hitchcock 1999). On a contrastivist\nview of explanation, explanations (always or sometimes) take the form\n\u2018Why P rather than Q?\u2019, where the contrast\n(Q) may be explicitly stated or implied by the context in which\nthe question \u2018Why P?\u2019 is asked. Such a view is entirely\ncompatible with an invariantist view of causation, since the role of\nthe contrast may merely be to select which of P\u2019s causes is\ncited appropriately in answering the question. Note also that\ncontrastivism about explanation does not appear to solve the (alleged)\nproblem at hand. In the case of Suzy\u2019s theft of the cake, it is the\ncontrast on the side of causes (and hence explananda) that is at\nissue, and not the contrast on the side of the effect (explanandum);\nit is unclear how we might vary the contextually salient contrast to\n\u2018Suzy became ill\u2019 in such a way that different contrasts\ndeliver different verdicts on whether \u2018Suzy stole the coconut\ncake\u2019 is an appropriate explanans.\n\nWhile the contrastivist account of causation is generally considered\nto be a version of causal contextualism, contrastivism is nonetheless\ninvariantist in the sense that there is a context-independent fact of the matter about\nwhich four-place causal relations hold: it\u2019s just plain true that Suzy\u2019s stealing the cake\nrather than leaving empty-handed caused her to be ill rather than\nwell, and false that her stealing rather than buying the cake caused\nher to be ill rather than well. The contrastivist account might therefore be seen as a\nkind of middle road between invariantism and contextualism. (See\nSteglich-Petersen 2012 and Montminy & Russo 2016 for critical\ndiscussions of contextualism/contrastivism.)\n\nThe contextualist/invariantist debate arises in a slightly different\nform in much of the debate about the structural equations framework\n(see\n \u00a75.5\n below), to which we now turn.\n",
