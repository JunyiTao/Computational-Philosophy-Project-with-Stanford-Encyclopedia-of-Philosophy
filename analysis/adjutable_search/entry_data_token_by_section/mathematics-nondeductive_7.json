    "main_text": "Alternative Non-deductive Methods || Experimental Mathematics\n3.1 Experimental Mathematics\n\nThe role of non-deductive methods in empirical science is readily\napparent and relatively uncontroversial (pace Karl Popper).\nIndeed the canonical pattern of justification in science is a\nposteriori and inductive. What makes empirical science empirical\nis the crucial role played by observation, and\u2014in\nparticular\u2014by experiment. A natural starting point, therefore,\nin a survey of non-deductive methods in mathematics, is to look at the\nrise of a genre known as \u201cexperimental mathematics.\u201d The\npast 15 years or so have seen the appearance of journals (e.g.,\nThe Journal of Experimental Mathematics), institutes (e.g.,\nthe Institute for Experimental Mathematics at the University of\nEssen), colloquia (e.g., the Experimental Mathematics Colloquium at\nRutgers University), and books (e.g., Borwein and Bailey 2003 and\n2004) devoted to this theme. These latter authors also argue, in\nBorwein and Bailey (2015), for the significance of experimental\nmathematics within mathematical practice more generally, while\nSorensen (2016) provides a broader historical and sociological\nanalysis of experimental mathematics. \n\nAgainst the background of the traditional dichotomy between\nmathematical and empirical routes to knowledge, the very term\n\u201cexperimental mathematics\u201d seems at best oxymoronic and at\nworst downright paradoxical. One natural suggestion is that\nexperimental mathematics involves performing mathematical\nexperiments, where the term \u201cexperiment\u201d here is\nconstrued as literally as possible. This is the approach adopted by\nvan Bendegem (1998). According to van Bendegem, an experiment involves\n\u201cthe manipulation of objects, \u2026 setting up processes in\nthe \u2018real\u2019 world and \u2026 observing possible outcomes\nof these processes\u201d (Van Bendegem 1998, 172). His suggestion is\nthat the natural way to get an initial grip on what a mathematical\nexperiment might be is to consider how an experiment in this\nparadigmatic sense might have mathematical ramifications.\n\nOne example that van Bendegem cites dates back to work done by the\n19th-century Belgian physicist Plateau on minimal surface\narea problems. By building various geometrical shapes out of wire and\ndipping these wire frames into a soap solution, Plateau was able to\nanswer specific questions about the minimum surface bounding various\nparticular shapes, and\u2014eventually\u2014to formulate some\ngeneral principles governing the configurations of such\n surfaces.[6]\n One way of understanding what is going on in this example is that a\nphysical experiment\u2014the dipping of a wire frame into a soap\nsolution\u2014is producing results that are directly relevant to a\ncertain class of mathematical problem. The main drawback of this way\nof characterizing experimental mathematics is that it is too\nrestrictive. Examples of the sort van Bendegem cites are extremely\nrare, hence the impact of mathematical experiments of this sort on\nactual mathematical practice can only be very limited at best.\nMoreover, it cannot be only this, literal sense of experiment that\nmathematicians have in mind when they talk about\u2014and\ndo\u2014experimental mathematics.\n\nSo much for the most literal reading of \u201cmathematical\nexperiment.\u201d A potentially more fruitful approach is to think in\nanalogical or functional terms. In other words, perhaps\n\u201cexperimental mathematics\u201d is being used to label\nactivities which function within mathematics in a way analogous to the\nrole of experiment in empirical science. Thus mathematical experiments\nmay share some features with literal experiments, but not other\nfeatures (Baker 2008; McEvoy 2008, 2013; Sorensen 2010; van Kerkhove\n2008). Before proceeding with this line of analysis, it may be helpful\nto look briefly at a case study.\n\nA nice example of current work in experimental mathematics appears in\none of the two recent books by Borwein and Bailey (1995b, Ch. 4). A\nreal number is said to be normal in base n if every sequence\nof digits for base n (of any given length) occurs equally often in its\nbase-n expansion. A number is absolutely normal if it is\nnormal in every base. Consider the following hypothesis:\n\nConjecture: Every non-rational algebraic number is absolutely normal.\n\n\nBorwein and Bailey used a computer to compute to 10,000 decimal digits\nthe square roots and cube roots of the positive integers smaller than\n1,000, and then they subjected these data to certain statistical\ntests.\n\nThere are a couple of striking features of this example that may point\nto a more general characterization of experimental mathematics.\nFirstly, the route from evidence to hypothesis is via enumerative\ninduction. Secondly, it involves the use of computers. In what\nfollows, these two features will be examined in turn.\n",
