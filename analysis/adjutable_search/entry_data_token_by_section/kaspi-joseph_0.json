    "main_text": "Life\n1. Life\n\nRecent studies have shed light on Kaspi\u2019s life such as his place\nof birth and the dates of his death and marriage. We can distinguish\nthree periods in Kaspi\u2019s life:\n\n1. Kaspi\u2019s birth until his return from Egypt. Joseph b.\nAbba Mari ibn Kaspi was born circa 1280 in Arles in Provence (or in\nArgenti\u00e8re, in the Languedoc region). In 1314, he traveled to\nEgypt in 1314 for five months:\n\nTwenty years ago, I was exiled to a place reputed for learning\u2026\nI crossed to Egypt, where I visited the College of that renowned and\nperfect sage, the Guide [=Maimonides]. I found there the fourth and\nfifth generations of his holy seed, all righteous, but none devoted to\nscience. In all the Orient there were no scholars\u2026 (Sefer\nHaMussar p.98)\n\n\nAs we see, his expectations\u2014of delving into Maimonidean thought\nthrough learning from Rabbi Abraham the Nagid\u2014were not\nmet. However, his exegesis was enriched by the things he saw on the\njourney.\n\nWe do not know of independent books by Kaspi from this period. He\nwrote a supercommentary on Ibn Ezra\u2019s commentary on the Bible,\nand a commentary on Sefer HaRikma by Ibn Janah.\n\n2. Kaspi\u2019s second Proven\u00e7al period\n(1314\u20131330), where he chiefly first in Arles, then\nin Tarascon. During this period, Kaspi apparently married and his\ntwo children, David, the eldest and Shlomo (1320), were born. In Arles\nKaspi completed his philosophical work Tirat Kesef (1317),\nwhich was harshly criticized by the scholars of Salon through\nKalonymus (1318). \n\n3. The Spanish period in Kaspi\u2019s life: 1330\u20131345.\nIn 1330, Kaspi moved from Tarascon to Spain, living with his family\nfor several years in Perpignan (from 1336), followed by Barcelona,\nMajorca, Valencia and Tudela. We know that Kaspi died in Majorca in\n1345 but now how he lived there. It seems that he traveled there to be\nalone and write, though this is uncertain. In the Spanish period Kaspi\nwrote many books, including three books on logic and linguistics:\n\u1e92eror HaKesef, a brief summary of parts of\nthe Organon for his son; Retuqot Kesef, an\napplication of the rules of logic to Hebrew and Hebrew grammar;\nSharshot Kesef, a Hebrew dictionary. These three books\nare among the most original and essential of Kaspi\u2019s work, and\nnone of them has been printed. Kaspi was well educated. Besides Hebrew\nand Proven\u00e7al, he was apparently also proficient in Arabic and\nLatin. He was familiar with the classical Hebrew religious literature,\nsuch as the Talmud and earlier Bible commentaries, and well-versed in\nthe works of Maimonides and his translator, Samuel ibn Tibbon. He was\nprobably also familiar with Falaquera\u2019s commentary on The\nGuide of the Perplexed. However, his knowledge of Halakhic\nliterature was limited by his own admission. Among the philosophers,\nhe mentions Averroes, Avicenna, Boethius, al-F\u0101r\u0101bi, and\nGalen, in addition to Plato and Aristotle.\n",
