    "main_text": "Logical Approaches || Circumscription\n5.5 Circumscription\n\nIn circumscription (McCarthy 1982; McCarthy 1986; Lifschitz 1988), one\nor more predicates of the language are selected for minimization\n(there is, in addition, a further technical question of which\npredicates to treat as fixed and which to treat as variable). The\nnonmonotonic consequences of a theory \\(T\\) then consist of all\nthe formulas that are true in every model of \\(T\\) that minimizes\nthe extensions of the selected predicates. One model \\(M\\) of\n\\(T\\) is preferred to another, \\(M'\\), if and only if,\nfor each designated predicate \\(F\\), the extension of \\(F\\)\nin \\(M\\) is a subset of the extension of \\(F\\) in\n\\(M'\\), and, for some such predicate, the extension in\n\\(M\\) is a proper subset of the extension in\n\\(M'\\).\n\nThe relation of circumscriptive consequence has all the desirable\nmeta-logical properties. It is cumulative (satisfies Cut and Cautious\nMonotony), strongly absorptive, and distributive. In addition, it\nsatisfies Consistency Preservation, although not Rational\nMonotony.\n\nThe most critical problem in applying circumscription is that of\ndeciding on what predicates to minimize (there is, in addition, a\nfurther technical question about which predicates to treat as fixed\nand which as variable in extension). Most often what is done is to\nintroduce a family of abnormality predicates \\(ab_1, ab_2\\),\netc. A default rule then can be written in the form: \\(\\forall x((F(x)\n\\amp \\neg ab_i (x) ) \\rightarrow G(x))\\), where\n\u201c\\(\\rightarrow\\)\u201d is the ordinary material conditional of\nclassical logic. To derive the consequences of a theory, all of the\nabnormality predicates are simultaneously minimized. This simple\napproach fails to satisfy the principle of Specificity, since each\ndefault is given its own, independent abnormality predicate, and each\nis therefore treated with the same priority. It is possible to add\nspecial rules for the prioritizing of circumscription, but these are,\nof necessity, ad hoc and exogenous, rather than a natural result of\nthe definition of the consequence relation.\n\nCircumscription does have the capacity of representing the existence\nof undercutting defeaters. Suppose that satisfying predicate\n\\(F\\) provides a prima facie reason for supposing something to be\na \\(G\\), and suppose that we use the abnormality predicate\n\\(ab_1\\) in representing this default rule. We can\nstate that the predicate \\(H\\) provides an undercutting defeater\nto this inference by simply adding the rule: \\(\\forall x\n(H(x) \\rightarrow ab_1 (x))\\),\nstating that all \\(H\\)s are abnormal in respect number 1.\n",
