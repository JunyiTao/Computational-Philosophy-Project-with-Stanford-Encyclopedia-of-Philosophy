    "main_text": "Classification Schemes in the Epistemology of Modality || Mental Capacities and Inferential Methods\n2.1 Mental Capacities and Inferential Methods\n\nThe distinction between mental capacities and inferential\nmethods is a natural starting point for addressing the Access\nQuestion. The mental capacities that are most discussed in\nthe epistemology of modality are: conceivability, understanding,\nimagination, intuition, and perception. The\ninferential methods are: deduction, induction, and\nabduction. We will see how those notions are spelled out more\nprecisely in the different theories. Mental capacities and/or\ninferential methods that are central to a theory of modal knowledge\noffer a main criterion for classifying theories. Furthermore, theories\nof modal knowledge need not restrict themselves to adopting only one\nmental capacity or inferential method. In fact, they sometimes combine\nthem in various ways.\n\nTheories should not only investigate which specific capacities and\nmethods are involved with modal knowledge, but also in virtue of what\nsuch capacities and methods yield the correct results. Mallozzi\n(2021e) accordingly distinguishes between descriptive and\nnormative tasks with regard to modal reasoning and modal\nknowledge. The descriptive task involves identifying and describing\nthe belief-formation processes and methods that subjects actually\ncarry out in modal reasoning (for example counterfactual reasoning, or\ndeductive inference). The descriptive task does not in itself involve\nanswering the question of how the processes are\ntruth-conducive. This question takes center stage in the normative\ntask, which targets the correctness conditions for such processes and\nmethods. More precisely, a chief normative task for the epistemology\nof modality is to elucidate what constrains such processes or methods,\ni.e., in virtue of what their outputs are correct or incorrect. As a\nnormative inquiry, the epistemology of modality is centrally concerned\nwith what Vaidya and Wallner (2021) call the Problem of Modal\nEpistemic Friction (PMEF). This problem concerns the normative\nrestrictions on candidate capacities or methods. Take, e.g.,\nimagination as a candidate mental capacity in our pursuit for\nmodal knowledge. In order for us to be properly guided to modal\nknowledge, we cannot apply imagination in a completely\nunrestricted manner. If no restrictions would apply, we could\nimagine all sorts of impossible things like water without hydrogen,\ntransparent iron etc. Hence, some restrictions, or\n\u201cepistemic friction creators\u201d, as Vaidya and\nWallner call them, have to be in place. The PMEF asks what the\nepistemic friction creators are and how we come to know them or at\nleast how we come to adequately deploy them in our application of\nvarious capacities and methods in order to be properly guided to modal\nknowledge.\n\nWhile descriptive tasks and normative tasks are distinct, they need\nnot be pursued independently. Normative modal epistemology may, for\nexample, be informed by empirical psychology (the study of\ncounterfactuals is a prominent example), and vice-versa.\n",
