Death\n\n\nAs Schlick was leaving class on June 22, 1936, he was shot four times\nin the legs and abdomen by Johann Nelb\u00f6ck, a former philosophy\nstudent who had been threatening Schlick for several years. In fact,\nNelb\u00f6ck had been confined in an asylum for observation and\ndiagnosed as a paranoid schizophrenic. Eventually, other factors\n\u2013both social and political- emerged which may also have\ninfluenced Nelb\u00f6ck. The number of possible motivations make it\nnearly impossible to fully understand what was in Nelb\u00f6ck\u2019s mind\nat the time of his murderous actions.  But the result of his misdeed\nis clear: with the death of Moritz Schlick, philosophy lost one of its\nmost creative thinkers. See Stadler 2001 (Part 2, Sec. 3\u20133.2) for a\ncomprehensive account of Schlick\u2019s death. \n",
