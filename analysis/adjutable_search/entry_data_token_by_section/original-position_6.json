    "main_text": "Other Conditions on Choice in the Original Position || Publicity and other Formal Constraints of Right (TJ \u00a723)\n5.2 Publicity and other Formal Constraints of Right (TJ \u00a723)\n\nThere are five \u201cformal constraints\u201d associated with the\nconcept of right that Rawls says the parties must take into account in\ncoming to agreement on principles of justice. The more a conception of\njustice satisfies these formal constraints of right, the more reason\nthe parties have to choose that conception. The formal constraints of\nright are: generality, universality in application, ordering of\nconflicting claims, publicity, and finality. The ordering\ncondition says that a conception of justice should aspire to\ncompleteness: it should be able to resolve conflicting claims and\norder their priority. Ordering implies a systematicity requirement:\nprinciples of justice should provide a determinate resolution to\nproblems of justice that arise under them; and to the degree that a\nconception of justice is not able to order conflicting claims and\nresolve problems of justice, that gives greater reason against\nchoosing it in the original position compared with those that do. The\nordering condition is important in Rawls\u2019s argument against\npluralist moral doctrines he calls \u201cIntuitionism.\u201d\n\nSidgwick attaches a great deal of importance to the ordering\ncondition, and contends that \u201cUniversal Hedonism\u201d is the\nonly reasonable moral doctrine that can satisfy it (Sidgwick 1907\n[1981], 406). Rawls would have to concede that justice as fairness\ndoes not possess, at least theoretically, the same degree of\nsystematic ordering of claims as does hedonistic utilitarianism which\nhas cardinal measures of utility. For example, Rawls\u2019s priority\nprinciples can resolve conflicting claims regarding the priority of\nbasic liberties over fair equality of opportunity, fair opportunity\nover the difference principle, the difference principle over the\nprinciple of efficiency and the general welfare, as well as many\ndisputes arising within the difference principle itself regarding\nmeasures that maximally promote the position of the least advantaged.\nBut there is no priority principle or algorithm to resolve many\nconflicts between basic liberties themselves (e.g. conflicts between\nfreedom of speech vs. rights of security and integrity of persons in\nhate speech cases; or the conflict between free speech and the fair\nvalue of equal political liberties in restrictions on campaign finance\ncontributions). Often in such conflicts we have to weigh competing\nconsiderations and come to a decision about where the greater balance\nof reasons lies, much like intuitionist views. (See Hart, 1973). Rawls\nin \u2018Basic Liberties and their Priority,\u2019 1980, PL ch.VIII,\naddresses this problem to some degree with the idea of the\nsignificance of a basic liberty to the development and full and\ninformed exercise of the moral powers.) The lack of a priority or\nalgorithmic ordering principle does not mean the balance of reasons in\nsuch conflicts regarding basic liberties is indeterminate but rather\nthat reasonable individuals will often disagree, and that final\ndecisions practically will have to be made through the appropriate\ndemocratic, judicial, or other procedures (which of course can be\nmistaken). But for Rawls a moral conception\u2019s capacity to\nclearly order conflicting claims is not dispositive, but one among\nseveral formal and substantive moral conditions that a conception of\njustice should satisfy (ultimately in reflective equilibrium).\n\nThe publicity condition says that the parties are to\nassume that the principles of justice they choose will be publicly\nknown to members of society and recognized by them as the bases\nfor their social cooperation. This implies that people will not be\nuninformed, manipulated, or otherwise have false beliefs about the\nbases of their social and political relations. There are to be no\n\u201cnoble lies\u201d, false ideologies, or \u201cfake news\u201d\nobscuring a society\u2019s principles of justice and the moral bases\nfor its basic social institutions. The publicity of principles of\njustice is ultimately for Rawls a condition of respect for persons as\nfree and equal moral persons. Rawls believes that individuals in a\ndemocratic society should know the bases of their social and political\nrelations and not have to be deceived about them in order to cooperate\nand live together peacably and on fair terms. Publicity plays an\nimportant role in Rawls\u2019s arguments against utilitarianism and\nother consequentialist conceptions. The idea of publicity is further\ndeveloped in Political Liberalism through the ideas of public\njustification and the role of public reason in political\ndeliberation.\n\nRelated to publicity is that principles should be universal in\napplication. This implies not simply that \u201cthey hold for\neveryone in virtue of their being moral persons\u201d (TJ 132/114\nrev.). It also means that everyone can understand the principles of\njustice and use them in their deliberations about justice and its\nrequirements. Universality in application then imposes a limit on how\ncomplex principles of justice can be\u2014they must be understandable\nto common moral sense, and not so complicated that only experts can\napply them in deliberations. For among other things, these principles\nare to guide democratic citizens in their judgments and shared\ndeliberations about just laws and policies.\n\nBoth publicity and universality in application (as Rawls defines it)\nare controversial conditions. Utilitarians, for example, have argued\nthat the truth about morality and justice is so complicated and\ncontroversial that it might be necessary to keep fundamental moral\nprinciples (the principle of utility) hidden from most\nindividuals\u2019 awareness. For morality and justice often require\nmuch that is contrary to peoples\u2019 beliefs and personal\ninterests. Also sometimes it\u2019s just too complicated for people\nto understand the reasons for their moral duties. So long as they\nunderstand their individual duties, it may be better if they do not\nunderstand the principles and reasons behind them. So Sidgwick argues\nthat the aims of utilitarianism might better be achieved if it remains\nan \u201cesoteric morality,\u201d knowledge of which is confined to\n\u201can enlightened few\u201d (Sidgwick 1907 [1981], 489\u201390).\nThe reason Rawls sees publicity and universality as necessary relates\nto the conception of the person implicit in justice as fairness. If we\nconceive of persons as free and equal moral persons capable of\npolitical and moral autonomy, then they should not be under any\nillusions about the bases of their social relations, but should be\nable to understand, accept, and apply these principles in their\ndeliberations about justice. These are important conditions Rawls\ncontends for the freedom, equality, and autonomy (moral and political)\nof democratic citizens.\n\nFinally, the generality condition is straightforward in that\nit requires that principles of justice not contain any proper names or\nrigged definite descriptions, which Rawls says rules out free-rider\nand other forms of egoism together with the ordering condition. The\nfinality condition says that moral principles of justice\nprovide conclusive reasons for action, providing \u201cthe final\ncourt of appeal in practical reasoning.\u201d They override demands\nof law and custom, social rules, and reasons of personal prudence and\nself-interest. (TJ 135\u201336/116\u201317). Finality is one of\nseveral Kantian conditions Rawls imposes that have been questioned by\ncritics on grounds that it underestimates inevitable and sometimes\nirresolvable conflicts of moral reasons with other values. For\nexample, should reasons of justice always be given priority\nover special obligations owed to specific persons or associations?\nShould moral reasons always be given priority over reasons of love,\nprudence, or even self-interest? (See Williams 1981, chs.1, 5; Wolf,\n2014, chs.2, 3, 9)\n",
