    "main_text": "Sentence Implicature\n3. Sentence Implicature\n\nAs we observed in\n \u00a71,\n Grice defined implicating as a form of speaker meaning. But Grice and\nothers nevertheless began applying \u201cimplicate\u201d to\nsentences, analogous to the way \u201cimply\u201d,\n\u201cpresuppose\u201d, and \u201cmean\u201d apply to sentences as\nwell as\n people.[22]\n If an implicature is conventional in either sense (that is, either\nsemantic or generalized), we may say that the sentence\nimplicates it, or has the\n implicature.[23]\n Even though Barb implicates that she is not going to Paul\u2019s\nparty, \u201cI have to work\u201d does not itself implicate this.\nBut \u201cSome athletes smoke\u201d implicates that not all do even\nthough speakers can use the sentence without implicating this.\n(Analogy: plane means \u201cairplane\u201d even though\nspeakers can use plane without meaning\n\u201cairplane\u201d.) Similarly,\n (4b)\n implies that Trump is a stable genius even though speakers can use it\nwithout implying that.\n\nWhereas knowledge of what speakers implicate is essential to fully\nunderstand speakers, knowledge of what sentences implicate is a\ncritical component of our knowledge of a language. This is obvious for\nsentences with semantic implicatures like\n (3a).\n But speakers are not fully competent with \u201csome\u201d unless\nthey know that it is related to \u201call\u201d in a way it is not\nrelated to \u201cseveral\u201d or \u201ctwo\u201d. A man using\n (5a)\n may mislead others if he does not realize that it implicates\n [5b],\n and fail to communicate if he thinks it implicates \u201cIt is not\nthe case that several athletes smoke\u201d.\n",
