    "main_text": "The Notion of the Aesthetic || The Problem\n4.2 The Problem\n\nThere are worries: is the contemporary classification\n\u201caesthetic\u201d arbitrary? What is it that distinguishes\njudgments as aesthetic? What do they have in common? How do they\ndiffer from other kinds of judgment? Do these judgments form a\nwell-behaved kind?\n\nIt may be worth mentioning in passing that the notion of an aesthetic\njudgment should obviously not be elucidated in terms of the idea of a\nwork of art; we make aesthetic judgments about nature and we make\nnonaesthetic judgments about works of art.\n\nThe articulation and defense of the notion of the aesthetic in modern\ntimes is associated with Monroe Beardsley (1958, 1982) and Frank\nSibley (1959, 1965). But their work was attacked by George Dickie, Ted\nCohen and Peter Kivy among others (Dickie 1965, Cohen 1973, Kivy\n1975).\n\nAs noted in Section 2.4, Beardsley claimed, heroically, that aesthetic\nexperience is distinguished by its unity, intensity and complexity.\nDickie argued, in reply, that such characteristics were either not\nplausibly necessary conditions of aesthetic experience, or else that\nBeardsley\u2019s description of them was inadequate. Part of\nDickie\u2019s attack was beside the point, since he confused\naesthetic experiences with the experiences of works of art; the fact\nthat some experiences of works of art are not as Beardsley describes\nis irrelevant. But it cannot be denied that Dickie was right that even\nif the problems with characterizing the three features were resolved,\nit would still not be plausible that the three Beardsleyian features\nare necessary (or sufficient) conditions of aesthetic experience.\nNevertheless, all that would show would be that\nBeardsley\u2019s account of the aesthetic is inadequate.\nThat Beardsley\u2019s extraordinary and heroic trinitarian doctrine\ncannot be maintained does not mean that the notion of the aesthetic\nshould be abandoned. That would be a flawed induction from a single\ninstance.\n\nSibley claimed that the discernment of aesthetic properties requires a\nspecial sensitivity, whereas the discernment of nonaesthetic\nproperties could be achieved by anyone with normal eyes and ears.\nFurthermore, Sibley claimed that it was distinctive of aesthetic terms\nor concepts that they were not \u201ccondition-governed\u201d, in\nthe sense that they had no nonaesthetic positive criteria for their\napplication. He thought of the faculty of taste as special mental\nfaculty, possessed by people with a distinctive sensitivity. This\naccount of the aesthetic was inadvisable, since it allowed critics\nlike Cohen and Kivy to argue that ascribing many aesthetic properties\ndid not in fact require a special faculty, since anyone can\ndistinguish a graceful line from an ungraceful line. Moreover, some\naesthetic ascriptions, such as elegance, do seem to be\nnonaesthetically \u201ccondition-governed\u201d, in Sibley\u2019s\nsense. Nevertheless\u2014once again\u2014that\nSibley\u2019s positive account of the aesthetic is\nimplausible should not lead us to despair about the aesthetic. On the\nother hand, a pessimistic induction, now with two instances under its\nbelt, is perhaps looking a little less unhealthy\u2014especially\ngiven two such distinguished exponents.\n\nDespite this, Sibley was surely minimally right to think that\nascribing aesthetic properties to a thing requires more than merely\nknowing its nonaesthetic properties. Whether or not the extra\nsomething is distinctively difficult, erudite, sophisticated or\nnon-condition-governed, it is something over and above nonaesthetic\nunderstanding. So perhaps we should keep on trying to articulate the\nnotion of the aesthetic, or at least a useful notion of the\naesthetic.\n",
