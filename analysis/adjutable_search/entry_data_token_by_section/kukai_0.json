    "main_text": "Biography\n1. Biography\n\nK\u016bkai grew up during the Nara period (710\u2013784CE) when the\nNara Buddhist schools flourished and the country was centralized under\nthe rule of the imperial family. And he was active during the\nbeginning of the Heian period (794\u20131185CE) when\ninstitutionalized Nara Buddhism underwent reform due to the influence\nof newer ideas coming from China, including K\u016bkai\u2019s own\nimportations. He comes from an aristocratic family, the Saeki, and as\na boy, he was educated by his maternal uncle, a Confucian scholar. At\nthe age of seventeen or eighteen, he entered the state university at\nthe then-capital Nagaoka but was soon disillusioned with its Confucian\neducation. He suddenly dropped out of the university and retired into\nthe natural setting of the mountains, where as legend has it, he\ndevoted himself to various forms of esoteric practices. A few years\nlater at the age of 24, he completed the final version of his first\ntreatise, the Sang\u014d sh\u012bki (Indications of the\nGoals of the Three Teachings) that covers and compares the\nteachings of Confucianism, Taoism, and Buddhism. Herein one can\ndiscern K\u016bkai\u2019s reasons for turning from Confucianism to\nBuddhism. In the text, K\u016bkai relates how as a student he met a\nBuddhist priest who taught him an esoteric meditative practice called\nthe Kok\u016bz\u014dgumonji no ho\n(\u201c\u0100k\u0101\u015bagarbha\u2019s method for seeking hearing\nand retaining\u201d), which involved the recitation of a mantra a\nmillion times and was supposed to endow the practitioner with\nmiraculous powers of memory and understanding.\n\nWhat K\u016bkai found in Buddhism was a concrete path towards\nenlightenment (and liberation from suffering) that involves bodily\npractice and direct experience rather than mere theoretical\nspeculation. K\u016bkai however did not involve himself in the\nofficial schools of the Nara Buddhist orthodoxy for they emphasized\nthe exegetical study of the scriptures without providing any\ntheoretical grounding for ritual practice. Instead he remained in the\nremote mountain regions of his native Shikoku as an unofficial and\nprivately ordained mendicant. It appears that between the ages of 24\nand 31, he wandered through its various mountains and sacred sites,\npracticing asceticism. Noticing the many different branches and\ns\u016btras (scriptures) of Buddhism, he hoped to find its\nunifying essence that would also bridge the gap between ritual and\nexperience on the one hand and doctrine and theory on the other hand.\nIt was during this search that he came across the mid-seventh century\nesoteric Buddhist text of the Dainichi-ky\u014d (Skrt:\nMah\u0101vairocana S\u016btra; Chn: Ta-ji Ching;\n\u201cGreat Sun scripture\u201d). Intuiting that this text, with its\ndual emphasis upon esoteric practice and doctrine, would provide the\nkind of knowledge that he was seeking, K\u016bkai decided to travel to\nChina to study it.\n\nIt was only in 804 at the age of 30 or 31 that K\u016bkai was thus\nofficially ordained so that he could travel with an official\ngovernment embassy to China. He travelled to Ch\u2019ang-an, the\ngreat cosmopolitan capital of the T\u2019ang (Tang) dynasty, where he\nresided for thirty months. During this period, he studied Indian\nBuddhism, Hindu teachings, and Sanskrit with two Indian monks. But\nmore significantly he met Hui-kuo (Huiguo; Jpn: Keika)\n(746\u2013805), the seventh patriarch of Chen-yen (Zhenyan; Jpn:\nShingon; Skrt: Mantray\u0101na) Buddhism, from whom he received\ninitiation into the two lineages of Chen-yen esoteric Buddhism, one\ncentered around the Vajradh\u0101tu (Diamond realm) mandala based on\nthe Vajra\u015bekhara S\u016btra (\u201cAdamantine {or\nDiamond} Pinnacle scripture\u201d) and the other focussing upon the\nGarbha (Womb) mandala based on the Mah\u0101vairocana\nS\u016btra. K\u016bkai\u2019s accomplishment during his stay in\nChina is phenomenal in that not only did he manage to succeed Hui-kuo\nin becoming the eighth patriarch of esoteric Buddhism, he also managed\nto study Sanskrit, Chinese poetry and calligraphy, and various other\nminor arts.\n\nK\u016bkai returned to Japan in 806 at the age of 33. He arrived in\nKyushu with a voluminous amount of s\u016btras, collections of mandala\npaintings, treatises and commentaries, books of poetry, and ritual\nparaphernalia. In Kyushu, he composed the Shorai mokuroku\n(A Memorial Presenting a List of Newly Imported S\u016btras and\nOther Items) that gives a brief account of his activities in\nChina, describes what distinguishes esoteric Buddhism, and lists the\nitems he had collected and brought back to Japan. However he was not\npermitted to enter the capital due to political unrest and was obliged\nto remain in Kyushu for another three years. Only with the retirement\nof Emperor Heizei (r. 806\u2013809), did the new Emperor Saga order\nK\u016bkai in 809 to move to the new capital of Kyoto to reside at\nTakaosan-ji, the center of the Kyoto Buddhist world, where he remained\nuntil 823. Under the patronage of the new emperor, K\u016bkai became\nappointed over the years to various administrative positions of\nseveral important official temples. This allowed him to perform the\nfirst public esoteric ritual for \u201cnation-protection,\u201d\nfollowed by other public esoteric ceremonies, including mass\ninitiation rituals and the founding of an annual ritual (the\nMishuh\u014d) to be held at court, hence gaining official\nrecognition for the efficacy of esoteric Buddhism and preparing the\nrise of Buddhism as an ideological force in medieval Japan.\n\nIt was during his period at Takaosan-ji that he wrote some of his\nmajor treatises of philosophical interest to us, such as\nBenkenmitsu nikky\u014dron (Treatise on the Differences\nBetween Esoteric and Exoteric Teachings) around 814, and the\nso-called Sanbu-sho (\u201cThree Writings\u201d) of\nSokushinj\u014dbutsugi (On the Meaning of\n\u201cAttaining Buddhahood in this Very Embodied\nExistence\u201d), Sh\u014djijiss\u014dgi (On the\nMeanings of \u201cSound, Sign, and Reality\u201d), and\nUnjigi (On the Meaning of the Syllable\nH\u016b\u1e43) in the 820s. And towards the end of his life he\ncompleted in 830 what has been considered to be his magnum\nopus, the Himitsu mandara j\u016bj\u016bshinron\n(Treatise on the Ten States of the Mind as a Secret Mandala)\nin ten volumes, and soon afterward, completed its summary version, the\nHiz\u014d h\u014dyaku (The Precious Key to the Secret\nTreasury) in three volumes. \n\nIn 816 K\u016bkai began building a monastic center in Mt. K\u014dya,\nand there he died in 835 at the age of 61. In 921, he posthumously\nreceived from Emperor Daigo and his court, the honorific title,\nK\u014db\u014d Daishi (\u201cGreat Teacher Who Spread the\nDharma\u201d).\n",
