    "main_text": "Philosophy of technology\n4. Philosophy of technology\n\nSafety and the avoidance of risk are major concerns in practical\nengineering. Safety engineering has also increasingly become the\nsubject of academic investigations. However, these discussions are\nlargely fragmented between different areas of technology. The same\nbasic ideas or \u201csafety philosophies\u201d are discussed under\ndifferent names for instance in chemical, nuclear, and electrical\nengineering. Nevertheless, much of the basic thinking seems to be the\nsame in the different areas of safety engineering (M\u00f6ller and\nHansson 2008). \n\nSimple safety principles, often expressible as rules of thumb, have a\ncentral role in safety engineering. Three of the most important of\nthese are inherent safety, safety factors, and multiple barriers.\n\nInherent safety, also called primary prevention, consists in the\nelimination of a hazard. It is contrasted with secondary prevention\nthat consists in reducing the risk associated with a hazard. For a\nsimple example, consider a process in which inflammable materials are\nused. Inherent safety would consist in replacing them by\nnon-inflammable materials. Secondary prevention would consist in\nremoving or isolating sources of ignition and/or installing\nfire-extinguishing equipment. As this example shows, secondary\nprevention usually involves added-on safety equipment. The major\nreason to prefer inherent safety to secondary prevention is that as\nlong as the hazard still exists, it can be realized by some\nunanticipated triggering event. Even with the best of control\nmeasures, if inflammable materials are present, some unforeseen chain\nof events can start a fire. \n\nSafety factors are numerical factors employed in the design process\nfor our houses, bridges, vehicles, tools, etc., in order to ensure\nthat our constructions are stronger than the bare minimum expected to\nbe required for their functions. Elaborate systems of safety factors\nhave been specified in norms and standards. A safety factor most\ncommonly refers to the ratio between a measure of the maximal load not\nleading to a specified type of failure and a corresponding measure of\nthe maximal expected load. It is common to make bridges and other\nconstructions strong enough to withstand twice or three times the\npredicted maximal load. This means that a safety factor of two or\nthree is employed.\n\nSafety factors are also used in regulatory toxicology and\necotoxicology. For instance, in food toxicology, the highest dose\nallowed for human exposure has traditionally been calculated as one\nhundredth of the highest dose (per kilogram body weight) that gave no\nobservable negative effect in experimental animals. Today, higher\nsafety factors than 100 have become common (Dourson and Stara 1983;\nPressman et al. 2017).\n\nSafety barriers are often arranged in chains. Ideally, each barrier is\nindependent of its predecessors so that if the first fails, then the\nsecond is still intact, etc. For example, in an ancient fortress, if\nthe enemy managed to pass the first wall, then additional layers would\nprotect the defending forces. Some engineering safety barriers follow\nthe same principle of concentric physical barriers. Others are\narranged serially in a temporal or functional rather than a spatial\nsense. One of the lessons that engineers learned from the\nTitanic disaster is that improved construction of early\nbarriers is not of much help if it leads to neglect of the later\nbarriers (in that case lifeboats).\n\nThe major problem in the construction of safety barriers is how to\nmake them as independent of each other as possible. If two or more\nbarriers are sensitive to the same type of impact, then one and the\nsame destructive force can get rid of all of them in one swoop. For\ninstance, if three safety valves are installed in one and the same\nfactory hall, each with the probability 1/1,000 of failure, it does\nnot follow that the probability of all three failing is \\(1 \\times\n10^{-9}\\). The three valves may all be destroyed in the same fire, or\ndamaged by the same mistake in maintenance operations. This is a\ncommon situation for many types of equipment. \n\nInherent safety, safety factors, and multiple barriers have an\nimportant common feature: They all aim at protecting us not only\nagainst risks that can be assigned meaningful probability estimates,\nbut also against dangers that cannot be probabilized, such as the\npossibility that some unanticipated type of event gives rise to an\naccident. It remains, however, for philosophers of technology to\ninvestigate the principles underlying safety engineering more in\ndetail and to clarify how they relate to other principles of\nengineering design (Doorn and Hansson 2015). \n\nMany attempts have been made to predict the risks associated with\nemerging and future technologies. The role of philosophers in these\nendeavours has often been to point out the difficulties and\nuncertainties involved in such predictions (Allhoff 2009; Gordijn\n2005). Experience shows that even after extensive efforts to make a\nnew product safe, there is a need for post market surveillance (PMS)\nin order to discover unexpected problems. For instance, before the\nmassive introduction of automobile air bags around 1990, safety\nengineers performed laboratory tests of different crash scenarios with\ndummies representing a variety of body weights and configurations\n(including infants and pregnant women). But in spite of the\nadjustments of the construction that these tests gave rise to,\ninflated airbags caused a considerable number of (mostly minor)\ninjuries. By carefully analyzing experiences from actual accidents,\nengineers were able to substantially reduce the frequency and severity\nof such injuries (Wetmore 2008). For pharmaceutical drugs and some\nmedical devices, post market surveillance is legally required in many\njurisdictions.\n",
