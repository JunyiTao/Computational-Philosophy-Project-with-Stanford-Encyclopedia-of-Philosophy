    "main_text": "False Statement || Negation\n6.1 Negation\n\n\nThe Stranger made a serious mistake about negation in the puzzles\nabout not-being earlier in the dialogue (highlighted at\nSophist 240b, 240d), in supposing that the negation in\n\u201cnot-being\u201d indicates the opposite\n(enantion) of being. The opposite of being is\nnothing, and Parmenides is right that we cannot speak or\nthink about nothing: if we speak or think at all, we speak or think\nabout something. But Parmenides mistakenly thought that all\ntalk about not-being is attempted talk about nothing.\n\n\nThe Stranger solves the problem of not-being by recognizing two \nthings: (1) the negation operates on the predicate, not the \nsubject; (2) the negation need not specify the opposite of the item \nwhose name is negated but only something different from it.\n\n\nSome scholars think that the Stranger extends his machinery to include\nnegative predication, as well as non-identity, at the end of the\nsection on great kinds. He appears to switch his focus from the\nsubject-kind to the attribute, since he speaks of being and not-being\n\u201cabout\u201d the subject. He sums up his conclusions about\nchange and generalizes to other kinds saying: \u201cAnd so\nnecessarily not-being applies to (epi) change and\nto (kata) all the other kinds\u201d\n(Sophist 256d); and then: \u201cSo about\n(peri) each of the forms the being is much and the not-being\nis unlimited in multitude\u201d (Sophist 256e). Some\nscholars take the not-being applicable to change to include negative\nfeatures (e.g., not quick) as well as kinds it differs from (e.g.,\nrest) (for interpretations of this sentence, see McDowell 1982 and\nFrede 1992).\n\n\nThe Stranger calls attention to the mistake about negation and offers\na solution. Here too he focuses on the predicate:\n\n\nWhen we say \u201cnot being\u201d (m\u00ea on), as it\nseems, we don\u2019t mean something opposite to being, but only\ndifferent.\u2014How?\u2014For instance, when we call\nsomething \u201cnot large,\u201d we don\u2019t indicate by the expression\nthe small any more than the equal.\u2014Of course\u2014So we won\u2019t\nagree when someone says a negation signifies an opposite; we will\nagree only to this much, that the \u201cnot\u201d when prefixed to\nthe names following it reveals something different [from the\nnames], or rather from the things which the names uttered\nafter the negation designate. (Sophist 257b\u2013c)\n\n\n\n\nApparently, when one says, \u201cSimmias is not large,\u201d one \nindicates by the \u201cnot\u201d merely something \ndifferent from large. Simmias could be equal or small in \ncomparison with someone else.\n\n\nNow there is a pressing interpretive question. Does the statement\n\u201cSimmias is not large\u201d assert that largeness is different\nfrom every attribute Simmias has (manhood, bravery, red-hair,\nblue-eyes, and so on)? (Keyt 1973 and Brown 2008 call this the\n\u201cOxford interpretation.\u201d For a recent defense of it, see Crivelli 2012.) The discussion of \u201cnot\nlarge\u201d itself suggests otherwise. \u201cDifferent from\nlarge,\u201d while not meaning the opposite of largeness (the polar\ncontrary smallness), means some size other than largeness\n(smallness being one possibility among others). The negation\ndesignates something within a wider kind, and the predicate negated\n(say \u201clarge\u201d) indicates that wider kind.\n\n\nIn characterizing the nature of difference, the Stranger compares it\nto knowledge (Sophist 257c\u2013d) (on this analogy, cf. Lee\n1972). Knowledge is a categorial kind, and many species of knowledge\ndiffer structurally from one another (cf. below \u00a7 7.2). Even so,\nthe comparison is instructive because some branches of knowledge, such\nas applied mathematics, are distinguished from one another, not by\nintrinsic differences in the structure of the expertise, but simply by\ndifferences in the objects to which the same expertise applies (e.g.,\ncalculation in surveying and navigation). Like varieties of applied\nmathematics, whose content derives from the domain to which the\nknowledge applies, parts of difference acquire their content from the\nitem whose name is negated.\n\n\nThe visitor gives a second example of negation, and the example helps\nto clarify his proposal. A part of difference called \u201cthe\nnot-beautiful\u201d is set in opposition to the beautiful and differs\nfrom the nature of the beautiful (Sophist 257d). He says:\n\n\nDoesn\u2019t it turn out in this way that the not-beautiful, having\nbeen marked off from (aphoristhen) some one kind\namong beings, is also again in turn set in opposition\n(antitethen) to some one of the things that are?\n(Sophist 257e)\n\n\n\n\nThe Stranger mentions two kinds in addition to the not-beautiful,\nsince he marks off the not-beautiful from some one kind among beings,\nand then sets it in opposition to the nature of the beautiful. The\nnot-beautiful is not just anything other than beautiful, but something\nother than beautiful within a kind that covers both (call it\n\u201cthe aesthetic\u201d). On this view a part of difference gets\nits categorial content in two ways from the item whose name is\nnegated. First, the part falls within a wider kind (such as size,\ntemperature, the aesthetic) determined by the positive attribute\nF-ness, and that wider kind is divided into subkinds which exclude one\nanother and jointly exhaust the genus; and second, the part has an\nattribute different from F-ness within that genus. All individuals\nlocated under the genus occupy one and only one subkind. The subkinds\ncan form an incompatibility range\u2014an ordered continuum\nunder a covering kind, such as degrees of coldness and heat under\ntemperature or degrees of smallness and largeness under size\u2014but\nthey need not constitute an ordered series. They can instead\nconstitute an incompatibility set, such as circle, square,\ntriangle, and other species under shape; or man, ox, horse, and other\nspecies under animal. The earlier mistake about negation was the\nassumption that \u201cthe not-F\u201d specifies the opposite of\nF-ness. According to the new proposal \u201cthe not-F\u201d\nspecifies the complement of F-ness under a wider\nkind\u2014that is, all the disjoint subkinds under the wider kind\nother than F-ness. Any individual characterized as \u201cnot-F\u201d\nfalls under the complement of F-ness and has some feature other than\nF-ness within the wider kind. Thus, for example, when you say\n\u201cSimmias is not large,\u201d you indicate that Simmias has some\ndefinite size other than largeness, either the polar contrary\nsmallness or some intermediate size. (Brown, 2008, calls this\ntreatment of negation the \u201cincompatibility range\u201d\ninterpretation; see also Ferejohn 1989, Szaif 1996, and M. L. Gill,\n2012, ch. 5.)\n",
