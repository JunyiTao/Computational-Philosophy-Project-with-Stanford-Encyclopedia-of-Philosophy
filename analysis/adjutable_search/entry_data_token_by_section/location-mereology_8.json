McDaniel's formulation of the objection, which is similar\nto Sider's, runs as follows:\n\n\nThe state of affairs in which [a simple] object x occupies a\nparticular region of space R (at t) is distinct from the\nstate of affairs in which [some other simple] object y occupies\nthe same region (at the same time). From the fact that the first state\nof affairs obtains, we can infer nothing about the location of\ny. Both states of affairs obtain contingently. If any\nrecombination of distinct, contingent states of affairs yields a\ngenuine possibility, as I am inclined to hold, then there are possible\nworlds at which both x and y occupy R (at\nt). (2007a: 241)\n\n\nLet o1 and o2 be two different\nobjects, let r be a region, and consider the following states\nof affairs:\n\ns1\no1's being simple and exactly located at\nr\ns2\no2's being simple and exactly located at\nr\n\n\nThen we can reconstruct McDaniel's argument as follows:\n\nPremise 1\ns1 is a contingent state of affairs.\nPremise 2\ns2 is a contingent state of affairs.\nPremise 3\ns1 is distinct from s2.\nPremise 4\nFor any x and any y, if x and y are\neach contingent states of affairs, and if they are distinct from each\nother, then possibly, both x and y obtain.\nTherefore\nConclusion\nPossibly, both s1 and s2\nobtain.\n\n\nIf it's possible for both s1 and\ns2 to obtain, then it's possible for a given region\nto be the exact location of two different simples. And since no two\nsimples can overlap, this would mean that it's possible for disjoint\nthings (the simples) to have identical (hence overlapping) exact\nlocations.\n\nIs the argument successful? As Sider and McDaniel are well aware, the\nterm \u2018distinct from\u2019 needs to mean something other than\n\u2018not identical to\u2019, if the recombination principle,\nPremise 4, is to get off the ground. After all, the state of affairs\nof o's being 2 kg in mass and the state of affairs of\no's being 3 kg in mass are both contingent, and they\nare not identical to each other, but presumably it is not possible\nthat they both obtain. (Presumably it's not possible that\nsomething is both 2 kg and 3 kg in mass.)\n\nBut it is no easy matter to give \u2018distinct from\u2019 a meaning\nthat makes Premises 3 and 4 simultaneously plausible. If it means\n\u2018shares no parts or constituents with\u2019, then Premise 4\navoids the counterexample given above, but Premise 3 ceases to be\nplausible, since s1 and s2 do\nplausibly share a constituent, namely r. If \u2018s is\ndistinct from s*\u2019 is defined as \u2018(i) possibly,\ns obtains and s* does not, (ii) possibly, s does\nnot obtain and s does, (iii) possibly, neither s nor\ns* obtains, and (iv) possibly, both s and s*\nobtain\u2019, then Premise 4 is trivially true, but Premise 3 begs\nthe question.\n\nFor additional arguments in favor of interpenetration, including a\nmore detailed recombination argument, see Section 1.1 of the\nsupplementary document\n Additional Arguments.\n",
