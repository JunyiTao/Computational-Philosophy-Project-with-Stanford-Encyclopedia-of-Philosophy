The Epistemological Status of Computer Science\u00a0\n\nBetween the 1960s and the 1970s, computer science emerged as an\nacademic discipline independent from its older siblings, mathematics\nand physics, and with it the problem of defining its epistemological\nstatus as influenced by mathematical, empirical, and engineering\nmethods (Tedre and Sutien 2008, Tedre 2011, Tedre 2015, Primiero\n2020). A debate is still in place today concerning whether computer\nscience has to be mostly considered as a mathematical\ndiscipline, a branch of engineering, or as a scientific\ndiscipline.\n",
