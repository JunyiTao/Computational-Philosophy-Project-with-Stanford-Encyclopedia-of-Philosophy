    "main_text": "The Logic of Action in Linguistics || Speech acts\n2.1 Speech acts\n\nThe study of speech acts goes back to Austin (1957) and Searle (1969). Both emphasise that using language is to perform certain acts. Moreover, there is not just one act but a whole gamut of them (Austin himself puts the number in the magnitude of \\(10^3)\\). The classification he himself gives involves acts that are nowadays not considered as part of a separate science: the mere act of uttering a word (the phatic act) or sentence is part of phonetics (or phonology) and only of marginal concern here. By contrast, the illocutionary and perlocutionary acts have been the subject of intense study. An illocutionary act is the linguistic act performed by using that sentence; it is inherently communicative in nature. By contrast, the perlocutionary act is an act that needs surrounding social contexts to be successful. The act of naming a ship or christening a baby, for example, are perlocutionary. The sentence \u201cI hereby pronounce you husband and wife\u201d has the effect of marrying two people only under certain well-defined circumstances. By definition, perlocutionary acts take us outside the domain of language and communication.\n\nSearle and Vanderveken (1985) develop a logic of speech acts which they call illocutionary logic. This was refined in Vanderveken 1990 and Vanderveken 1991. Already, Frege used in his Begriffsschrift the notation \u201c\\(\\vdash \\phi\\)\u201d, where \\(\\phi\\) denotes a proposition and \u201c\\(\\vdash\\)\u201d the judgment sign. So, \u201c\\(\\vdash \\phi\\)\u201d says that \\(\\phi\\) is provable, but other interpretations of \\(\\vdash\\) are possible (accompanied by different notation; for example, \u201c\\(\\models \\phi\\)\u201d says that \\(\\phi\\) is true (in the model), \u201c\\(\\dashv \\phi\\)\u201d says that \\(\\phi\\) is refutable, and so on). An elementary speech act is of the form \\(F(\\phi)\\), where \\(F\\) denotes an illocutionary point and \\(\\phi\\) a proposition. In turn, an illocutionary force is identified by exactly seven elements:\n\na point,\nthe mode of achievement of the illocutionary point,\nthe degree of strength of the illocutionary point,\nthe propositional content conditions,\nthe preparatory conditions,\nthe sincerity conditions,\nthe degree of strength of the sincerity conditions.\n\n\nThere are exactly five points according to Searle and Vanderveken (1985):\n\nThe assertive point is to say how things are.\nThe commissive point is to commit speaker to doing something.\nThe directive point is to get other people to do things.\n The declarative point is to change the world by saying so.\nThe expressive point is to express feelings and attitudes.\n\n\nLater treatments of this matter tend to disregard much of the complexity of this earlier approach for the reason that it fails to have any predictive power. Especially difficult to handle are \u201cstrengths\u201d, for example. Modern models try to use update models instead (see Section 2.3 below). Van der Sandt 1991 uses a discourse model with three different slates (for each speaker, and one common slate). While each speaker is responsible for maintaining his own slate, changes to the common slate can only be made through communication with each other. Merin 1994 seeks to reduce the manipulations to a sequential combination of so-called elementary social acts: claim, concession, denial, and retraction.\n\nUttering a sentence is acting. This action can have various consequences, partly intended partly not. The fact that utterances as actions are embedded in a bigger scheme of interaction between humans has been put into focus recently (see, for example, Clark 1996). Another important aspect that has been highlighted recently is the fact that by uttering a sentence we can change the knowledge state of an entire group of agents, see Balbiani et al. 2008. After publicly announcing \\(\\phi\\), \\(\\phi\\) becomes common knowledge among the entire group. This idea sheds new light on a problem of Gricean pragmatics, where certain speech acts can only be successful if certain facts are commonly known between speaker and hearer. It is by means of an utterance that a speaker can establish this common knowledge in case it wasn\u2019t already there.\n",
