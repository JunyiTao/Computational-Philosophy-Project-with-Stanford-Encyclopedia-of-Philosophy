    "main_text": "Leibniz on Space and Time || Against Absolute Space and Time\n5.1 Against Absolute Space and Time\n\n\nIn his correspondence with Leibniz, Clarke defends what has become \nknown as an absolute theory of space and time. The version championed\nby Clarke on Newton\u2019s behalf might briefly be characterized for our \npurposes as having four central theses. First, space and time are \nlogically and metaphysically prior to physical bodies and events. \nThat is to say, although space and time could exist even if there \nwere no physical bodies or events, the existence of things like \nplanets and flashes could not exist without space and time. Second, \nphysical bodies and events exist within space and time \n\u2013 the beach ball is collocated with a region of space equal to \nits volume; the explosion endures through a determinate measure of \nabsolute time. Third, although we may distinguish regions, or \n\u201cparts,\u201d of space and time, neither space nor time \nstrictly speaking are divisible since no region of space or time \ncould be separated, or \u201cpulled apart,\u201d from any other \nregion. Fourth, ontologically speaking, space and time may be \nidentified with attributes of God: infinite space just is the \nattribute of God\u2019s Immensity, while infinite time just is \nthe attribute of God\u2019s Eternity. \n\n\nLeibniz introduces three main lines of attack against the \nClarke-Newton conception of absolute space and time. The first line \nfocuses on the suggestion that space and time might be identified \nwith the divine attributes, and on Newton\u2019s claim \u2013 made in his\n Optics[31]\n \u2013 that space is, as it were, the sensorium of God. \nLeibniz, at root, argues that such claims are deeply misleading at \nbest, heretical at worst. Thus, for example, against the suggestion \nthat space might be identified with God\u2019s Immensity, he \nwrites to Clarke, \u201cif space is a property of God \u2026 space\nbelongs to the essence of God. But space has parts: therefore there \nwould be parts in the essence of God\u201d (Fifth Paper, paragraph \n43; G VII.399/Alexander 68). Likewise, he argues that if time were \nidentified with God\u2019s Immensity, then we would have to say \nthat since things are in time, they are in God\u2019s Immensity, \nand thus in God\u2019s essence, \u201cStrange expressions; which plainly \nshow, that the author [i.e. Clarke] makes a wrong use of terms\u201d\n(Fifth Paper, paragraph 44; G VII.399/Alexander \n 68).[32]\n Finally, from his first letter on, Leibniz seizes on what he takes to\nbe the impious implication of Newton\u2019s suggestion that space might in\nsome sense be considered the seat of divine perception or cognition, \nwriting, \u201cSir Isaac Newton says, that space is an organ, which \nGod makes use of to perceive things by. But if God stands in need of \nany organ to perceive things by, it will follow, that they do not \ndepend altogether upon him, nor were produced by him\u201d (First \nPaper, paragraph 3; G VII.352/Alexander 11). \n\n\nA second, more philosophical, line of attack pivots on Leibniz\u2019s \ncommitment to the Principle of Sufficient Reason (PSR). In \nthe present context we can understand the PSR as demanding that there be \nsome reason for God\u2019s creating the world in one way rather than \nanother since \u201cA mere will without any motive, is a fiction, \nnot only contrary to God\u2019s perfection, but also chimerical and \ncontradictory\u201d (Fourth Paper, paragraph 2; G \nVII.371\u20132/Alexander 36). Leibniz argues that if the PSR is granted, \nthe apparent possibility of absolute space and time can be \nundermined. For, on the supposition that God creates the world in an \ninfinite, homogenous, absolute space, there could be no reason for \nhis creating the world oriented in one way with respect to that space\nrather than another way \u2013 that is, there could be no reason to \nprefer the world situated in one way rather than, say, rotated in \nspace by ninety degrees. Since the supposition of absolute space thus\nleads to a violation of the PSR, the supposition itself must be \nrejected as chimerical or confused according to Leibniz. Similarly, \non the supposition that God creates the world in an infinite, \nhomogenous, absolute time, there could be no reason for God\u2019s \ncreating the world at one time rather than at another time. Again, \nsince the supposition leads to a violation of the PSR, Leibniz \nmaintains that the supposition itself must be rejected as chimerical \nor confused. \n\n\nA third line of attack offered by Leibniz against the Newtonian \nconception of space and time draws on another principle familiar from\nLeibniz\u2019s metaphysics, namely, the Principle of the Identity of \nIndiscernibles (PII). In the present context we may understand \nthe PII as ruling out the possibility of two things being distinct, \nbut not distinct in virtue of some discernible property. It thus \nsuggests that where we cannot identify a recognizable difference \nbetween two things or possibilities, those two are in fact only one \n\u2013 that is, as Leibniz puts it, that \u201cTo suppose two \nthings indiscernible, is to suppose the same thing under two \nnames\u201d (Fourth Paper, paragraph 6; G VII.372/Alexander 37). \nArmed with the PII, Leibniz argues once again that the apparent \npossibility of absolute space and time can be undermined. For on the \nsupposition of absolute space, the world oriented in one way with \nrespect to space would have to be a distinct possibility from the \nworld oriented in another way with respect to absolute space. But, \naccording to Leibniz, two such purported possibilities would be \nindiscernible since no being \u2013 not even God or an angel \u2013\ncould recognize any difference between them. Leibniz thus concludes \nthat since the supposition of absolute space leads to a violation of \nthe PII, the supposition itself must be rejected. By essentially the \nsame reasoning, Leibniz argues similarly that the apparent \npossibility of absolute time is also inconsistent with the PII and so\ntoo must be rejected as chimerical or confused. \n",
