    "main_text": "What is Cultural Heritage? || Cultural Heritage vs. Natural Heritage\n1.5 Cultural Heritage vs. Natural Heritage\n\nCulture has historically been distinguished from nature, but that\ndichotomy has come under attack in many disciplines: the study of\nheritage is no exception (Harrison 2015). A sharp distinction between\nthe two seems particularly ill-placed in cultural contexts where\nnature figures prominently, as is the case in many indigenous and\naboriginal cultural contexts. For instance, if relationships with the\nland (Figueroa & Waitt 2010) or particular plant and animal\nspecies (Whyte 2017) are of particular cultural significance, then a\ndichotomy between natural and cultural heritage can fail to accurately\nrepresent the beliefs and practices of these cultures. Moreover, some\nendeavor to illuminate theoretical approaches to the value of cultural\nheritage via conceptual tools from work on the value of nature,\narguing that we should treat heritage conservation like nature\nconservation, importing common thinking about the intrinsic value of\nnature into our thinking about cultural heritage (Harding 1999).\nHowever, dissolution of the contrast between natural and cultural\nheritage is also subject to objections. For instance, discourse\nsurrounding nature can bring with it methods and understandings that\nreintroduce problems into discussion of cultural heritage, such as the\nelevation of cultural heritage to a \u201cuniversal\u201d value\n(discussed further in\n section 2.2)\n that can disenfranchise or displace local cultural communities\n(O\u2019Neill 2002), or as a non-renewable resource on par with\ncommon thinking about the value of nature, leading to state\nintervention (Meskell 2011). As a consequence of the collapse between\nthese two domains, some argue\n\n\nthat the legacies of enclosure, eviction and salvage that developed\naround sites of natural value have indelibly informed our\nunderstanding and management of cultural places.
