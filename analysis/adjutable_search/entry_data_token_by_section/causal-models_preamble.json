    "main_text": "\n\nCausal models are mathematical models representing causal\nrelationships within an individual system or population. They\nfacilitate inferences about causal relationships from statistical\ndata. They can teach us a good deal about the epistemology of\ncausation, and about the relationship between causation and\nprobability. They have also been applied to topics of interest to\nphilosophers, such as the logic of counterfactuals, decision theory,\nand the analysis of actual causation.\n",
