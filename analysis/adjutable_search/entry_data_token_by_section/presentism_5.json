    "main_text": "Definitional Concerns || Existence Presentism\n3.3 Existence Presentism\n\nAs we\u2019ve seen, standard ways of characterizing presentism face\ndefinitional worries. So, let\u2019s change tack for a moment.\nTypically, presentism is presented as the view that only present\nthings exist. But it might seem natural to suppose that there\u2019s\nmore to presentism than a claim about the extent of our ontological\ncommitments. That is, presentism shouldn\u2019t just be seen as a\nlist of which objects exist (the present ones), but a claim about\nexistence itself. For instance, Dean Zimmerman (1996) characterizes\npresentism as the view that \u201cto be present just is to\nbe real or to exist\u201d (1996: 117). When presentism is\ncharacterized in this way, we can label it \u201cExistence\nPresentism\u201d, following Jonathan Tallant (2014).\n\nTrenton Merricks gives a more thorough expression of this picture, as\nfollows:\n\n\n[Standard] definitions, even though they get at something important,\nfail to get at what separates presentism most fundamentally from\neternalism. \u2026 [Presentism] and eternalism differ most\nfundamentally with respect to the nature of time and, relatedly, with\nrespect to what it is to exist at a time (and to have properties at a\ntime). (2007: 119\u201320)\n\nPresentists and eternalists alike say that those things that exist at\nthe present time really do exist and, moreover, that properties had at\nthe present time really are had. Thus one might think that, while\npresentism and eternalism part ways with respect to other times, they\nagree about the nature of the present time and, relatedly, agree about\nwhat it is to exist (and have properties) at the present time. But\nthey do not agree about these things. Indeed, their differences with\nrespect to the nature of, and existence at, the present time are as\nimportant as their differences with respect to the past and the\nfuture. (2007: 123)\n\n[Presentists] insist that there are objects that exist at the\npresent time (or, equivalently, that presently exist).\nSince they do not believe in a region called the \u201cpresent\ntime\u201d, presentists cannot reduce existing at the present\ntime to being located at that region. I think presentists should,\ninstead, say that existing at the present time just is\nexisting. Thus, given presentism, if something exists, then,\nobviously enough, it exists at the present time. So, given presentism,\nsince everything exists, everything exists at the present time. (2007:\n125)\n\n\nThis way of characterizing presentism challenges the orthodoxy\n(sketched in\n \u00a71),\n which takes the main difference between presentism and eternalism\n(etc.) to be their distinct ontological commitments. On this revised\nway of thinking, such ontological disagreements are a consequence of\nthe view, rather than what\u2019s truly distinctive about it.\nInstead, what\u2019s crucial to presentism is a claim about the\nnature of existence. To exist is to be present.\n\nHow, if at all, does this way of thinking about presentism help with\nthe definitional worries? This move might help us to identify a new\nkind of disagreement between presentists and non-presentists.\nPresentists can endorse an identity claim, \u201cexisting at the\npresent time is existing\u201d and, thus, draw new battlelines. This\nidentity claim is present-tensed and true now; it\ndoesn\u2019t face the same worries as the other statements of\npresentism (P1,\nP2, or P3).\nNonetheless, the claim is distinctive; it\u2019s not something to\nwhich eternalists can assent. Eternalists don\u2019t agree that\nexisting now is existing.c\n",
