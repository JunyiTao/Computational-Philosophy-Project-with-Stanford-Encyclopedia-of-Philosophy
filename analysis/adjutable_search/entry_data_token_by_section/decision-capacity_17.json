A\nnumber of critics of the model remain convinced that failure to attend\nto emotion in capacity assessment is problematic (White 1994; Charland\n1998b; Halpern 2011, 2012; Bursztajn et al. 1991; Breden &\nVollmann 2004; Hermann et al. 2016).\n\nWhen they think of emotion, most people think of discrete emotional\nepisodes, for example, particular experiences of anger, sadness or\njoy. While these are no doubt important, the realm of emotional\nphenomena is much broader, something that some theorists capture by\ntalking more generally of \u201caffect\u201d or \u201caffective\nphenomena\u201d. In addition to particular episodes of emotion,\npeople have emotional dispositions, moods and longer-term emotionally\nshaped outlooks. For example, someone who is depressed experiences\nmuch more than just a single discrete episode of sadness. To be\ndepressed is to view many things through a dark emotional lens that\ncan shape how a person views her life, what she cares about, and what\nshe sees as worth pursuing. \n\nThere are now a number of published studies that report that depressed\npatients are often decisionally capable and compare well with matched\ncontrols (Appelbaum & Grisso 1995; Vollmann et al. 2003;\nAppelbaum, Grisso, et al. 1999). However, what is being reported is\nthat these patients did well when assessed using instruments like\nthe MacCAT-T which is based on the four abilities model. Because\nthe authors of the studies have faith in that model they clearly\nintend their results to license normative conclusions. However,\ncritics worry that negative emotional outlooks can lead depressed\npatients to weigh risks and benefits differently (Elliot 1997; Rudnick 2002). Since such patients do not care as much about themselves or their own lives, they may not\ncare about risks in the same way they would if not depressed.\nSuch patients are cognitively intact: they understand the relevant\nfacts and grasp that the facts apply to them. But depressed affect may\nstill (so it is argued) undermine their ability to decide. More\nrecently it has been suggested that those who assess the capacity of\npersons with severe depression may need to consider their ability to\nproject themselves into the future as this may relate to hope or loss\nof hope that may impact on decision-making (Halpern 2012; Meynen 2011;\nOwen, Freyenhagen, et al. 2015; Owen, Martin, & Gergel 2018). Some\ntheorists have argued that affect and emotion play a central role in\nmany other mental disorders, even those not necessarily thought of as\ndisorders of affect. On that basis they have argued that the problems\noutlined here\u2014problems related to the fact that the\nfour-abilities model ignores emotion\u2014may also arise with these\npatients. Examples include addiction (Charland 2011), patients with\nOCD (Ruissen 2015; Ruissen et al. 2016), and patients with anorexia\nnervosa (Charland, Hope, et al. 2013; Charland 2015).\n\nCertainly it is true that emotional influences on decision-making can\nbe profound. Our cultural bias (no doubt elicited by the previous\nexample) is to think of emotions as making decisions worse (Charland,\n1998a: 359). But this is to overlook the very real ways that\nemotion\u2014even strong emotion\u2014can improve decision-making.\nMoreover, although it is not often acknowledged, it is only because we\nare creatures with affective capacities that we care about\nthings. A creature completely devoid of emotion or affect would\npresumably not care about anything and so would have no basis for\nmaking decisions (Charland 1998a,b).\n\nStill, the difficulty of focusing on emotions in the current context\nis that we do not have a principled way of distinguishing between the\ngood influences of emotion on decision-making and the bad influences.\nMoreover we need a way to draw this distinction that is independent of\nour opinion about the goodness or badness of the choices being made.\nMost of us tend to see the influence of emotion as bad when we think\nthe decision reached is bad, and vice versa. But value neutrality and\nthe related commitment to a process-based approach rule this out.\nFinally, some theorists have recently voiced worries about what might\nhappen if emotionality were included in capacity assessments in\nthe wrong way. Including emotionality might be good for some\npatients, e.g., those with depression, but might result in too much\nloss of freedom for autistic persons or other neurodiverse people\nwhose emotional responses are different from the norm but who arguably\nare quite able to make decisions for themselves (Mackenzie & Watts\n2011a,b).\n",
