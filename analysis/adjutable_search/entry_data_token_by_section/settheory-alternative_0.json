    "main_text": "Why Set Theory?\n1. Why Set Theory?\n\nWhy do we do set theory in the first place? The most immediately\nfamiliar objects of mathematics which might seem to be sets are\ngeometric figures: but the view that these are best understood as sets\nof points is a modern view. Classical Greeks, while certainly aware of\nthe formal possibility of viewing geometric figures as sets of points,\nrejected this view because of their insistence on rejecting the actual\ninfinite. Even an early modern thinker like Spinoza could comment that\nit is obvious that a line is not a collection of points (whereas for\nus it may hard to see what else it could be; Ethics, I.15,\nscholium IV, 96).\n\nCantor\u2019s set theory (which we will not address directly here as\nit was not formalized) arose out of an analysis of complicated\nsubcollections of the real line defined using tools of what we would\nnow call topology (Cantor 1872). A better advertisement for the\nusefulness of set theory for foundations of mathematics (or at least\none easier to understand for the layman) is Dedekind\u2019s\ndefinition of real numbers using \u201ccuts\u201d in the rational\nnumbers (Dedekind 1872) and the definition of the natural numbers as\nsets due to Frege and Russell (Frege 1884).\n\nMost of us agree on what the theories of natural numbers, real\nnumbers, and Euclidean space ought to look like (though constructivist\nmathematicians will have differences with classical mathematics even\nhere). There was at least initially less agreement as to what a theory\nof sets ought to look like (or even whether there ought to be a theory\nof sets). The confidence of at least some mathematicians in their\nunderstanding of this subject (or in its coherence as a subject at\nall) was shaken by the discovery of paradoxes in \u201cnaive\u201d\nset theory around the beginning of the twentieth century. A number of\nalternative approaches were considered then and later, but a single\ntheory, the Zermelo-Fraenkel theory with the Axiom of Choice\n(ZFC) dominates the field in practice. One of the strengths\nof the Zermelo-Fraenkel set theory is that it comes with an image of\nwhat the world of set theory is (just as most of us have a common\nnotion of what the natural numbers, the real numbers, and Euclidean\nspace are like): this image is what is called the \u201ccumulative\nhierarchy\u201d of sets.\n",
