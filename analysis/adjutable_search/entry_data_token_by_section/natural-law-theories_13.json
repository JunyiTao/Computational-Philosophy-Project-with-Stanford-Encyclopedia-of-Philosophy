    "main_text": "Other elements of natural law theory || Intention in action and utterance\n6.1 Intention in action and utterance\n\n\nRules of law are propositions of practical reason, apt for being taken\nas directive in the deliberations of law\u2019s individual subjects towards\njudgment, choice (decision), and action (including chosen\nforbearance). So a sound theory of law will have an integrated and\ncritical understanding of the structure of chosen action, particularly\nof the relationships between the intending of ends, the adoption of\nmeans, the dual character of almost all ends as also means, and of\nalmost all means as also ends, and the necessity and normal\npossibility of freely choosing between options which embody or promise\nbenefits and disadvantages incommensurable (incompletely\ncommensurable) (Finnis 1997) with the benefits and disadvantages of\nthe alternative options. Such an understanding will clarify the often\nsomewhat crude accounts given in criminal law dogmatics (case law and\ntextbooks) of actus reus andmens rea, accounts which\noften fail to distinguish been action as a physically or\nconventionally demarcated chunk of behavior and action as the carrying\nout of the choice of an option, that is of a proposal shaped and thus\ngiven a privileged description in the deliberations of the acting\nsubject. The difference between intended or chosen means (or ends) and\nforeseeable or even fully foreseen effects\n(\u201cside-effects\u201d), like the consequent difference between\nthe moral and, presumptively, legal standards applicable respectively\nto intended and not-intended effects, is psychologically and morally\nreal. But it is often distorted by a simplistic legal dogmatics too\naverse to the (very real) risk that defendants will prevaricate about\nwhat they had in mind. What counts, and can often be inferred despite\nprevarication, is the act-description under which the behavior chosen\nwas attractive to the defendant in his or her actual deliberations (as\ndistinct from rationalizing act-descriptions adopted to present that\nmotivation in a better light).\n\n\nThe reality of intention in the distinct but related field of\ncommunication of meaning will also be explored and defended by a\nnatural law theory of law. This does not involve an unqualified and\nsimple originalism in constitutional interpretation, or a simple\ndenial of the characteristic insistence of legal dogmatics that the\nintention of the parties to agreements or declarations is to be\nascertained \u201cobjectively (not subjectively),\u201d that is, by\nreference to what a reasonable observer would have taken the statement\nin issue to mean. For: such an observer (and thus the\n\u201cobjective\u201d viewpoint) will presumptively have given\nprimacy in this interpretation to what (as far as the observer can\ndiscern in the circumstances of the statement\u2019s making [= utterance])\nthe statement\u2019s author actually (\u201csubjectively\u201d) meant (=\nintended to express/state).\n",
