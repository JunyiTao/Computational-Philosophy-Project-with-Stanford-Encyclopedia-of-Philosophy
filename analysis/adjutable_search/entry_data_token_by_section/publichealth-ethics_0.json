What Makes Public Health, And Therefore Public Health Ethics, Distinctive?\n\nThere is no standard way of organizing the ethics of clinical\npractice, public health, and biomedical science. These different\nfields are often presented as discrete areas of inquiry that fall\nunder the broader, umbrella term of bioethics, but sometimes bioethics\nis presented as the equivalent of medical ethics or in contrast to\npublic health or population-level bioethics. Whichever approach is\npreferred, a key question remains: what distinguishes public health\nethics from these other fields, and especially from the ethics of\nclinical care? The answer lies in two characteristics of public health\nthat make it distinctive and that mark morally relevant differences\nbetween public health and clinical care- first, public health\u2019s\nfocus on the health of populations and second, the large role that\ngovernment plays in this pursuit.\n",
