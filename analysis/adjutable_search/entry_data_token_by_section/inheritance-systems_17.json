    "main_text": "Developmental and Evolutionary Implications || The ontogeny of inheritance systems\n4.3 The ontogeny of inheritance systems\n\nInheritance systems themselves develop so as to be able to store,\ntransmit, and receive hereditary information. Put differently, the\ninheritance of the capacity for inheritance may itself involve\ndevelopmental reconstruction processes. These developmental processes\nmay depend on two types of resources: resources and cues from other\ninheritance channels (e.g., the genetic system specifies elements of\nthe brain, which are required for behavioral inheritance), and cues\nthat are transmitted through the same channel and affect its further\ndevelopment (e.g., linguistic cues affecting linguistic abilities).\nRecent research on chromatin dynamics makes it clear that genetic\ninheritance relies on multiple epigenetic mechanisms, and suggests\nthat we should be cautious with the distinction between a genetic\ninheritance system and cellular epigenetic inheritance systems (Lamm\n2011, 2014).\n\nAn interesting example from recent research is the suggestion that\nsensorimotor experience plays a role in the development of the\ncapacity for imitation in the human brain (Catmur, Walsh, & Heyes\n2009). It is argued that if this model is correct, then \u201chuman\nimitation is not only a channel, but also a product of cultural\ninheritance\u201d (Catmur et al. 2009: 2376), since imitation not\nonly takes part in cultural inheritance, it is shaped by it as well.\nThus, cultural inheritance may provide scaffolding for the development\nof imitation abilities in humans, which further affect behavioral and\ncultural inheritance.\n",
