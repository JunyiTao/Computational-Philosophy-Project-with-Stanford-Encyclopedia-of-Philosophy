    "main_text": "Life and Works || Works\n1.1 Works\n\nLeibowitz\u2019s philosophy found expression in numerous essays that\nfirst appeared in Hebrew periodicals and were subsequently collated,\nwith some overlap, into a handful of volumes published at irregular\nintervals, most significantly Torah u-Mitzvot ba-Zeman ha-Zeh\n[Torah and Commandments in Our Time] (1954); Yahadut, Am Yehudi\nu-Medinat Yisrael [Judaism, Jewish People, and the State of\nIsrael] (1975); and Emunah, Historiah, va-Arakhim [Faith,\nHistory, and Values] (1982). 1982 also saw the publication of the\ntranscripts of his study-group on Maimonides\u2019 Shemoneh\nPerakim \u2013 the section of Maimonides\u2019 Commentary to\nthe Mishnah that serves as an introduction to Tractate\nAvot (generally known in English as the Ethics of the\nFathers). A number of his contributions to Israeli television and\nradio also appeared in print \u2013 including series on the philosophy\nof Maimonides and on the weekly Torah reading \u2013 and continue to do\nso posthumously, along with transcripts of further study-group\ndiscussions. Though far better known in Israel than in the\nEnglish-speaking world, the publication in English translation of a\ncollection of his writings in 1992 \u2013 Judaism, Human Values,\nand the Jewish State \u2013 opened the way to a growing critical\nengagement with his thought beyond those oft disputed borders. While\nas recently as 2015 it was possible for one scholar to state that his\n\u201coriginal and unique concept of Jewish religiosity has hardly\nbeen adopted by other Jewish thinkers and practitioners, in Israel and\nabroad\u201d (Benbassat 2015, 141), one now finds a broadening of\nLeibowitz scholarship beyond exclusively Jewish concerns and the\nKantian comparisons that were the staple of early critical work, to a\nclutch of recent attempts to place his work in proximity to that of\nEmmanuel Levinas, whose work Leibowitz held in high\n regard,[2]\n and S\u00f8ren Kierkegaard. His radio broadcasts on Maimonides and on the\nweekly Torah reading of 1985\u20131986 are now also available in\nEnglish.\n",
