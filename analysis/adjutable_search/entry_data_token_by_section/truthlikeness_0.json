The Logical Problem\n\nTruth, perhaps even more than beauty and goodness, has been the target\nof an extraordinary amount of philosophical dissection and\nspeculation. By comparison with truth, the more complex and much more\ninteresting concept of truthlikeness has only recently become the\nsubject of serious investigation. The logical problem of truthlikeness\nis to give a consistent and materially adequate account of the\nconcept. But first, we have to make it plausible that there is a\ncoherent concept in the offing to be investigated.\n",
