    "main_text": "From Languages of Art to Reconceptions: New Looks at Aesthetic Issues || Conditions of Identity for Works of Art\n4.3 Conditions of Identity for Works of Art\n\nGoodman\u2019s theory of symbol systems, as composed of schemes of\ncharacters that are governed, depending on the sort of system, by\ndifferent syntactical rules, and correlated to their extensions\naccording to differing semantic rules, is at the basis of his claims\non the identity conditions of works of art of different kinds. Given\nthe syntactic and semantic characteristics of notational systems, the\ndifferent art forms can be arranged on a spectrum made of the sorts of\nsystems that stand between a pure notation\u2014where there is\nperfect preservation of identity between replicas (or performances) of\nthe work\u2014and fully dense pictorial systems\u2014where every\nwork is an original.\n\nGoodman relates the issue of identity of works to whether a\nwork\u2019s history of production is integral to the work or\nnot. In brief, it appears that in painting and related art forms, such\nas drawing, watercolor, and the like (where there is only one instance\nof a work), but also in etching, woodcut, and the like (where there\ncan be multiple instances of the same work), aspects of the\nwork\u2019s history of production are indeed essential to the\nidentity of the work. Only the actual canvas that was painted by\nRaphael in 1505 counts as the Madonna del Granduca, and only\nthose prints that come from the original plate used by Rembrandt for\nhis Self-Portrait with a Velvet Cap with Plume (1638) count\nas the originals of that work\u2014anything else is a copy, however\napparently indistinguishable from the original. Art forms like\npainting and etching are for this reason named by Goodman\n\u201cautographic\u201d arts: \u201ca work of art is autographic if\nand only if the distinction between original and forgery of it is\nsignificant; or better, if and only if even the most exact duplication\nof it does not thereby count as genuine\u201d (1976, 113). You are\nlooking at Raphael\u2019s Madonna or at Rembrandt\u2019s\nSelf-Portrait only if you are looking at specific items\nproperly connected, historically, to the artist who produced them. By\ncontrast, music, dance, theater, literature, architecture seem to\nallow, although in different ways, for instantiations of the work that\nare independent of the work\u2019s history of production. You can\nlisten to a performance of Beethoven\u2019s Fifth Symphony\neven if it is performed (as it would normally be) from a contemporary\nprint of the score. Art forms like music, dance, etc., accordingly,\ncan be called \u201callographic.\u201d\n\nAs the examples above already illustrate, the distinction between\nautographic and allographic arts is not the same as that between arts\nthat are singular and those that are multiple. Etching, for instance,\nis still autographic although multiple. Incidentally, this could allow\nGoodman to account for the interesting hypothesis, advanced by Gregory\nCurrie (1989), of superxerox machines capable of reproducing paintings\nin a molecule-by-molecule faithful way. Such a cloning technique,\nGoodman could say, would transform the art of painting from singular\nto multiple, and yet without changing it from autographic to\nallographic.\n\nNor is the autographic/allographic distinction to be confused with\nthat between one- and two-stage art forms, so distinguished according\nto whether the realization of the work requires some form of\nexecution. A painting (which is autographic) is accessible once\ncompleted, while a theatrical play (allographic) requires a\nperformance. Yet, allographic arts, too, can be one-stage, e.g., in\nthe case of a novel, and autographic arts be two-stage\u2014woodcut\nfor example.\n\nMore relevantly, Goodman articulates his theory of work identity by\naddressing whether a given art form allows for a notational system,\ni.e., for a \u201cscore\u201d that would \u201cspecify the\nessential properties a performance must have to belong to the\nwork\u201d (1976, 212). Accordingly, Goodman\u2019s can also be seen\nas a novel way to account for the fact that some art\nforms\u2014painting and sculpture for instance\u2014do not allow for\nperformances, while other art forms\u2014such as music and\ndance\u2014do. Advanced at first as a tentative approach, and indeed,\nthroughout presented as open to revisions, the proposal is developed\nsomewhat systematically, with the clear intent of showing its\npotential for becoming a general and comprehensive theory. Music,\npainting, literature, theater, dance, and architecture are all\naddressed with respect to the question of their relationships with the\nsyntactic and semantic requirements of a notation. Goodman\u2019s\nframework ends up being quite technical, given the need to refer to\nand explain the syntactic and semantic characteristics of notational\nsystems. Also, such terms as \u201cscore,\u201d\n\u201cscript,\u201d and \u201csketch,\u201d which all acquire\nspecialized meanings. By the same token, the questions are not asked\nhypothetically or just as a mental exercise\u2014in that sense,\ntrivial notations could be devised for any art form (Goodman,\nElgin 1988, Chap. 7). Rather, the questions are addressed with\nreference to the systems of notations already existing, when they do,\nand, more generally, with awareness of the actual history of the\nvarious art forms.\n\nNaturally, music and painting (and with the latter, of course,\nsculpture) end up standing on opposite sides of the spectrum, the\nfirst being allographic and allowing for a notation, the second\nautographic and not admitting of any notation compatible with\npractice. A work of music is, for Goodman, \u201cthe class\nof performances compliant with a character\u201d (1976, 210), where\nthe character is the musical work\u2019s score. Consider that music\nwritten in standard musical notation is, for the most part\u2014or,\nmore precisely, for the \u201cmain corpus of peculiarly musical\ncharacters\u201d (Goodman 1976, 183), i.e., for the flags arranged on\nthe pentagram\u2014in a notational language. All and only those\nperformances that fully correspond to, or \u201ccomply with,\u201d\nthe score count as performances of the work. Even one small mistake on\nthe part of the performer, say, in replacing one note for another, is\nsufficient to declare that, technically, a different work has been\nperformed. On the other hand, other, important aspects of standard\nmusical notation are not in a notational system: indications\nof tempo, for instance, as well as the convention of letting the\nperformer choose the cadenza, give great latitude to the performer.\nHence, in Goodman\u2019s view, while two performances that sound\nalmost exactly alike may not be performances of the same work,\nradically differently sounding performances may be. Notice, however,\nhow the question of identity is here sharply distinct from the\nquestion of value: \u201cthe most miserable performance without\nactual mistakes does count as [a genuine instance of a work], while\nthe most brilliant performance with a single wrong note does\nnot\u201d (Goodman 1976, 186).\n\nOne might be tempted to dismiss Goodman\u2019s proposals for their\nconflicting with ordinary language and musical practice. Yet, it is\nmost important to remember that Goodman is aware of ordinary practice\nand does not expect it to comply with the philosopher\u2019s\ntechnical requirements (as \u201cone hardly expects chemical purity\noutside the laboratory\u201d [1976, 186]). Nor is he interested in\nreforming ordinary language: \u201cI am no more recommending that in\nordinary discourse we refuse to say that a pianist who misses a note\nhas performed a Chopin Polonaise than that we refuse to call a whale a\nfish, the earth spherical, or a grayish-pink human white\u201d\n(Goodman 1976, 187). Indeed, Goodman\u2019s approach to the question\nof notation is, in an important sense, grounded in previous practice,\nfor a notational system is an acceptable one only when projected\nfrom a previous classification of works. Furthermore, the history\nof an art form may include (as music did) an autographic stage, which\nonly at a later time made room for the establishment of a notation, on\nthe grounds of previous practice. Nor is Goodman\u2019s approach\nlacking in application to real musical cases, as his discussion of\nalternative musical notations proves. Without, again, evaluating the\ndifferent systems of musical notation, Goodman shows how an\nalternative system, such as the one proposed by John Cage, is not\nnotational, and is indeed in important ways closer to a\n\u201csketch,\u201d hence to a drawing, than to a score (Goodman\n1976, 187\u2013190).\n\nWhat was just said about music also applies largely, in\nGoodman\u2019s view, to the art of dance. While dance does\nnot yet have a standard notation, Goodman finds the tentative notation\nproposed by Rudolf Laban (which indeed Laban proposed for movement in\ngeneral) to be a good candidate for a notational system, indeed one\nwith fewer departures from notationality than standard musical\nnotation. And here is one of the many areas where the results of an\naesthetic investigation, however tentative, may be relevant to other\nareas of human knowledge and activity. Goodman points out how a\nsuccessful notation for human movement could be of great assistance in\nstudies ranging from psychology to industrial engineering, in which it\nis of utmost importance to find criteria for determining whether, say,\na subject or an experimenter has repeated the same behavior: and\n\u201cthe problem of formulating such criteria is the problem of\ndeveloping a notational system\u201d (1976, 218).\n\nThe conclusion that Goodman reaches about architecture is\nalso a good indicator of the importance placed, in his analysis, on\nthe actual history of an art form. Goodman claims that architecture\ndoes have, in the architect\u2019s plans, something quite close to a\nnotational system, and hence is, because of that, an allographic art:\ndifferent buildings, built in different locations and even with\ncertain differences in materials, would be instances of the same\nwork, provided that they correspond to the same plan. Yet, aware\nof the history of the art form, namely, of its origins as an\nautographic art and of a certain dependence, even today, on the\nparticular history of production of the particular building, Goodman\nconcludes that in fact \u201carchitecture is a mixed and transitional\ncase\u201d (1976, 221). \n\nAs said, painting stands at the opposite extreme from a\nnotational system, since works in this art form are\n\u201canalogs,\u201d characters in syntactically and semantically\ndense systems. It is important to emphasize how that does not mean\nthat a classification of paintings according to a notational system\ncould not be found, or even found easily: a library-type\nclassification for paintings for instance. What it does mean, however,\nis that, given the history of the medium and of the ways of\nclassifying works of painting, a library-type notation would be\nincompatible with established artistic practice. The painting itself\n(or, in the case of etching, only the prints using the original plate)\ncounts (or count) as the work. And what is true of painting\nis true of the sketches that precede the painting. The sketch itself\nis a work of art, and one that is autographic, in spite of its being\nused as a guide to the production of the final work (Goodman 1976,\n192\u2013194).\n\nSince the question of whether a notational system can be devised for a\ngiven art form is ultimately a question on the possibility of a\n\u201clanguage\u201d for that art form, i.e., at least of a\nnotational scheme, art forms that use natural language bear\ninteresting and sometimes surprising results. With a novel, poem, or\nthe script used for a play or movie, the text is a character in a\nnotational scheme. However, what counts as a work in such art forms is\ndifferent. In theater or drama, a work is a set of\nperformances compliant with what established in the script. As in the\ncase of music, Goodman\u2019s analyses involve a departure from the\nordinary use of language: the dialogue of a play really works as a\n\u201cscore,\u201d while stage directions and the like are a\n\u201cscript\u201d\u2014the former is fully notational,\nsyntactically and semantically, the latter does not uniquely determine\nthe performance, nor is it uniquely determined by the performance\n(1976, 210\u201311). It is the \u201cscore\u201d part of the text\nthat allows, in theater, for the work to be located in the set of\nperformances. By contrast, with a novel or a poem,\nwhere no \u201cscore\u201d is part of the text, and hence the text\nis a \u201cscript,\u201d the work, Goodman claims, is the text\nitself (understood as a set of inscriptions fully corresponding, in\nspelling and punctuation, with each other). Even in the later work,\nReconceptions, Goodman reemphasizes this claim (1988a,\n49-65). While endorsing pluralism with regard to the number of correct\ninterpretations (i.e., \u201capplications\u201d) a text may\nyield\u2014indeed considering it often a positive feature of the\nartistic use of language\u2014Goodman insists that the work, in\nliterary art, is the text. Hence, in Jorge Luis\nBorges\u2019s famous Pierre Menard case (that of a fictional\nFrench author trying to write a novel word-for-word identical to\nCervantes\u2019s Don Quixote [Borges 1962]), Goodman claims\nthat what Menard produced was another inscription of Don\nQuixote\u2019s text, hence an instance of the same work, albeit\nwith his actions Menard may have suggested a possible, new\ninterpretation of that work. Incidentally, the contrast between\ntheater and the literature more narrowly conceived (i.e., as not\nincluding drama) may raise a question regarding poetry. Qua text with\nmeaning (or \u201capplications\u201d, a poetic work is the text\nitself; yet, qua text to be performed, e.g., recited out loud for an\naudience, the poem would seem to be considered a character in a\nnotational system, a \u201cscore\u201d with as its field of\nreference the sounds to be uttered. On the other hand, in\ncinema, an art form Goodman does not address, again, one\ncould identify, within the screenplay, a \u201cscore\u201d in the\nparts that indicate dialogue, a \u201cscript\u201d in the scene and\ninstructions, with the ontology of the film itself, however, being\nthat of a multiple art form made of the concrete reproductions of the\nvisual and audio recordings that are displayed in the movie theater or\non the TV screen.\n\nGoodman\u2019s theory of notation, and the analysis of the differing\nways in which different art forms relate to that notion, establish\nalmost a system for the arts, one that perhaps has not yet received\nsufficient credit from theorists working in aesthetics. Instead, for\nthe most part contemporary discussion has concentrated on individual\nart forms and problematic examples.\n\nWithin the ontology of music, the claim for which the score fully, and\nsolely, individuates the work has received the most attention.\nSeparating ontological from evaluative claims, as seen above, Goodman\ncould not state his stance on the matter more clearly: \u201cthe most\nmiserable performance without actual mistakes\u201d counts as an\ninstance of a work, \u201cwhile the most brilliant performance with\none wrong note does not\u201d (1976, 186). Of the two claims, that\ncompliance with a score is necessary for a performance to be\nconsidered a bona fide instance of a musical work has been received\nwith way more controversy than the one for which full compliance is\nsufficient to declare a performance a legitimate work instance. The\nformer claim may seem naturally problematic. First of all, it clearly\nconflicts with actual practice. Of course, as mentioned, Goodman does\nnot aim at reforming ordinary usage. Hence, his view is a form of what\nin art ontological discussions has become known as\n\u201crevisionism\u201d (versus \u201cdescriptivism\u201d; cf.\nDodd 2012) only in the sense that it separates ontological claims from\nactual artistic and art critical practices, thus allowing for even\nradical departures from such practices\u2014yet, again, without\nadvocating their modification. Even if all that is granted, to many,\nincluding thinkers who are sympathetic to the approach, Goodman\u2019s\nleaving no wiggle-room, so as to allow the inclusion of performances\nthat defer from the score for just minor mistakes (when not welcome\nchanges), is problematic. Indeed, and further, there seems to be a\nconceptual problem in making sense of the claim on brilliant and yet\nwrong performances. For, of course, if a performance is wrong, hence\nfails to be an instance of a work, how can it then be referred to as\n\u201cbrilliant,\u201d i.e., a brilliant performance, ultimately,\nof such work (Ridley 2013)? The more general and interesting\nquestion, here, may be whether Goodman\u2019s theory has the resources to\naccount for the kinship an incorrect performance of Beethoven\u2019s\nFifth Symphony has to the Fifth, which other musical\npieces (performances of Three Blind Mice to use\nGoodman\u2019s example) lack. Again, on Goodman\u2019s behalf, dividing,\nhere, might be the only way to conquer. The ontological claim on what\nindividuates an artwork\u2014hence, on what counts as a bona fide\ninstance or performance of a work\u2014is in itself independent of\nclaims, in themselves not even philosophical, on what makes a musical\npiece recognizably similar (or virtually identical) to another. None\nof Goodman\u2019s ontological claims need to deny such empirical facts.\nFurther, recognizability, here, may interestingly intersect with\nsymbolization. After all, Goodman is keenly interested in the symbolic\nrelations between works of art (including, e.g., works that count as\nvariations on the same theme; see 1976, 260\u2013261, and Goodman,\nElgin 1988, Chap. 4). A performance that aims, say, at an especially\nintense and driven rendering of a piece and, as a consequence of that,\nincludes, perhaps unavoidably, departures from the prescribed notes,\nmay be considered a (brilliant) rendering of such a piece by\nvirtue of reference to, including exemplication of, the piece as\nindividuated by the original score, although, ontologically, be\nconsidered\u2014as it should be, Goodman would insist\u2014an\ninstance of a distinct work.\n\nEspecially when concentrating on just one art form and, hence,\npossibly losing sight of Goodman\u2019s more general and systematic\nproject, it might pass unnoticed that the separation between\nevaluative and ontological claims, in Goodman, is borne by an approach\nfor which whatever individuates an artwork in the different art forms\ndoes not necessarily individuate all of the artwork\u2019s\nproperties, in which, aesthetically, we are interested. What Goodman\nsays, e.g., about literature applies to all art forms: \u201cdefining\nliterary works no more calls for setting forth all their significant\naesthetic properties than defining metals calls for setting forth all\ntheir significant chemical properties\u201d (1976, 210). After all,\nin art forms like music written according to traditional Western\nnotation, which have developed a notation, we are legitimately\ninterested in the different performances of a work of art\u2014and in\nthe best ones among them\u2014precisely because what defines them as\nperformances of a work is not the same as the set of aesthetic\nproperties the work has to offer. On the other hand, one might be\nsuspicious of the degree of inclusiveness of aesthetic properties\n(i.e., of non-work-defining properties that may nonetheless be the\nobject of aesthetic attention) Goodman allows. That is, one might\nwonder whether the sufficiency claim, for which mere\ncompliance with a \u201cscore\u201d (in Goodman\u2019s technical sense\nof the term) is all that is needed to identify, within art forms that\nhave notations, bona fide work instances. With respect to the\nallographic arts, Goodman is opposed to making any concession to the\nrelevance of historical properties to the individuation of\nartworks\u2014it\u2019s all left to the rules of the notation, at the\nsyntactic or, if applicable, the semantic level. Hence, a work of\nmusic is whatever the \u201cscore,\u201d semantically, individuates;\nand a work of literature is the text itself, the\n\u201cscript,\u201didentified by the syntactic requirements of\nnotations. Yet, in either case, there would be room for a modified\nnotion of the allographic (investigated, for music, by Levinson 1980),\naccording to which a \u201cscore\u201d or a \u201cscript\u201d are\nbest understood, not just as structures, but as ones projected within\ngiven contexts. Such a move would allow restricting the range of\naesthetic properties a given artwork can comprise. A performance of\nBeethoven\u2019s Fifth executed so as to last a year, within\nsuch a notion of the allographic, could be considered the performance\nof a derivative (and bizarre) work, not of the Fifth.\nSimilarly, interpretations of a novel that were to run against what is\ncompatible with a given historically located projection (say, because\nanachronistic, or because incompatible with the genre a work is in)\ncould, then, be declared inadmissible, or admissible as\ninterpretations of an identical text, yet one projected within a\ndifferent context and effectively amounting to a different work.\n\nIt is worth emphasizing how Goodman, although he begins his\ninvestigation with the autographic/allographic distinction (indeed\nintroduced as a rough approximation), aims at developing an account of\nthe role notation, at the syntactic or semantic level, plays within\ncertain arts but not others. The result is not just an explanation of\nthe autographic nature of some arts and the allographic nature of\nothers. It is a way more articulated account of the variety of ways in\nwhich notationality, when present, has authority in identifying\nartworks in the various arts, hence in differently determining the\nlocalization of what counts as the artwork. To sum up, where a\n\u201cscore\u201d is present, hence syntactic and semantic\nnotationality, usually, the work is a compliance class of\nperformances. Where a \u201cscript\u201d is present, hence a\nnotation only at the syntactic level, usually, the work is a class of\ninscriptions compliant with such script. Where notation is not\nestablished at either the semantic or the syntactic level, there is a\n\u201csketch,\u201d which is usually the work itself, as a concrete\nindividual or series of concrete individuals.\n\nThe complexity of the approach invites caution towards dismissing\nGoodman\u2019s reasoning on the grounds of alleged counterexamples.\nIt is quite clear how Goodman, throughout his work, takes himself as\nmostly offering \u201csuggestions\u201d towards a theory, not yet a\ncomplete one. Further, what he says about architecture, and the art\nform\u2019s being a \u201cmixed and transitional\u201d case, or\nabout drama, and its comprising, in the text of the play,\n\u201cscore\u201d and \u201cscript,\u201d suggests looking at\nways, which Goodman seems to foresee, of combining parts of his\naccount, and achieving more fine-grained results than the mere verdict\non whether an art form is allographic or autographic, notational or\nnot. Hence, in addition to what mentioned above about poetry and\ncinema, it is worth wondering what Goodman could say of certain forms\nof installation and conceptual art. For example, when Sol LeWitt gave\ninstructions to create hisWall Drawings (works that were,\nthen, realized by other individuals), was he producing works that\nrepresent an insurmountable challenge to Goodman\u2019s distinctions\n(cf. Pillow 2003)? One possibility would be to consider LeWitt\u2019s\ninstructions as a \u201cscript,\u201d which could in itself be\ncounted as an artwork (much as a literary work), but, also, as\ninstructions for the production of distinct works, constituted by the\ndrawings actually realized. Such drawings, in turn, could be\nconsidered variations on the \u201ctheme\u201d indicated by those\ninstructions, while each an individual work, a concrete\n\u201csketch\u201d; or, perhaps, each of LeWitt\u2019s Wall\nDrawings is best considered a work with unusual mereology, a\ncompound made of the \u201csketches\u201d\u2014one by one or all\ntogether \u2014and those instructions. Whatever the answer to the\nquestions arising in individual cases, the Goodmanian framework, with\nall its limits and underdeveloped areas, can clearly offer a range of\npossibilities and conceptual intersections. Somewhat relatedly,\nGoodman\u2019s willingness to claim that there are cases, as with the\nclass of performances of a John Cage\u2019s composition embodied in a\nnon-conventional score that qualifies as a \u201csketch,\u201d in\nwhich work identity fails to be established (Goodman 1972b, 83-84),\nmay be worthy of further consideration, as the various developments\nwithin art may have to make room for cases in which the identity of a\nwork is uncertain. \n",
