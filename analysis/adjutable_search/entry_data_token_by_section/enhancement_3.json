    "main_text": "What are the Proper Limits of Health Care? || Professional Domain Accounts\n2.1 Professional Domain Accounts\nThe first approach to defining the line between treatment and\nenhancement appeals to the health professions\u2019 conventional\nvision of their proper domain. Accordingly, \u201ctreatments\u201d\nare any interventions that the professional standards of care endorse,\nwhile \u201cenhancements\u201d are any interventions that the\nprofessions declare to be beyond their purview. Attempts by\nprofessional societies to police their own frontiers by discouraging\nparticular practices as \u201cenhancement\u201d rather than\n\u201ctreatment\u201d reflect this approach, as do appeals to\n\u201ccommunity standards\u201d by health care payers seeking to\ndistinguish \u201celective\u201d from \u201cmedically\nnecessary\u201d interventions for payment.\nFor those committed to a particular account of the goals of health\ncare, this approach can offer normative guidance for internal\ncriticism of suspect professional practices (Kass 1985). But of\ncourse, there are numerous competing philosophies of health care, none\nof which command universal allegiance within the health\nprofessions. In fact, this approach also resonates well with those who\nargue that the health professions have no intrinsic domain of\npractice, beyond that which they can negotiate with patients (Good\n1994). For those influenced by this libertarian view of professional\nautonomy, the normative lesson for professionals concerned about their\nobligations in specific cases can be simple: whatever interventions\ntheir patients will accept can be considered \u201ctreatments\u201d,\nwhile \u201cenhancements\u201d are simply those interventions which\nindividual health professionals refuse to provide (Engelhardt\n1990). Unfortunately, medical historians and sociologists point out\nthat the health professions have always been adept at adapting to the\ncultural beliefs and social values of the institutions and communities\nthey serve. This is done by \u2018medicalizing\u2019 new problems so\nthat they come to be seen as a legitimate part of medicine\u2019s\njurisdiction (Conrad 2007). Given the health professions\u2019\nphilosophical pluralism and political autonomy, their own conventions\nseem to provide no principled way to exclude new interventions from\ntheir domain. To the extent that useful \u201cupper-boundary\u201d\nconcepts are required at the policy level (e.g., for societies making\nhealth care allocation decisions) this impotence is an important\nfailing for this approach to drawing the distinction.\n",
