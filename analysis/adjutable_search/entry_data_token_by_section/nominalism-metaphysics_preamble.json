    "main_text": "\n\n\nNominalism comes in at least two varieties. In one of them it is the\nrejection of abstract objects; in the other it is the rejection of\nuniversals. Philosophers have often found it necessary to postulate\neither abstract objects or universals. And so Nominalism in one form or\nanother has played a significant role in the metaphysical debate since\nat least the Middle Ages, when versions of the second variety of\nNominalism were introduced. The two varieties of Nominalism are\nindependent from each other and either can be consistently held without\nthe other. However, both varieties share some common motivations and\narguments. This entry surveys nominalistic theories of both\nvarieties.\n",
