    "main_text": "Free Speech, Conscience, and Dialectical Inquiry\n8. Free Speech, Conscience, and Dialectical Inquiry\n\nIn 1523 as Speaker of the House of Commons, More delivered an oration\nrequesting freedom of speech in the House of Commons (c. 1556\nRoper\u2019s Life of More [EW 1387.80\u201386,\n1393\u201394]). He argued that though the king and his prudent\nadvisors had, with \u201cdue diligence\u201d, called upon \u201cthe\nmost discreet persons out of every quarter\u201d to give \u201cright\nsubstantial counsel\u201d, yet since a person\u2019s \u201cmind is\noften so occupied with the matter\u201d being discussed, it might\nhappen that the person \u201crather studieth what to say\nthan how\u201d to say it\u2014or another person might be\n\u201cso fervent in a matter\u201d that he might \u201cspeak in\nsuch a wise as he would afterward wish to have uttered\notherwise\u201d. So, to be\n\n\nutterly discharged of all doubt and fear how anything that it should\nhappen them to speak, should happen of your Highness to be taken,\n\n\nMore requested that\n\n\nour most benign and godly King \u2026 give to all your Commons here\nassembled your most gracious licence and pardon, freely, without doubt\nof your dreadful displeasure, every man to discharge his conscience,\nand boldly in everything incident among us to declare his advice.\n(EW 1394.19\u201371)\n\n\nHere, and consistently throughout his writings, this\n\u201cdischarge\u201d of one\u2019s conscience was ordered\n\u201cto declar[ing] \u2026 the very truth\u201d as one saw it\nafter \u201cthe matter [had been] thoroughly debated \u2026 using\ndiligence and troth\u201d (1 February 1533/4 letter to Thomas\nCromwell [EW 376.12, 62]; The Debellation of Salem and\nBizance [CW 10: 162.14\u201315, 26]; also c. 1513\nHistory of King Richard III [EW 125.65], 1533\nAnswer to a Poisoned Book [EW 918.40\u201343],\n<August 1534> letter of Margaret Roper to Alice Alington\n[EW 1318.52], 1535 Paris Newsletter [EW\n1385.10 and 25], 1548 Hall\u2019s Chronical [EW\n1389.50]; see esp. More\u2019s two 1534 letters to Wilson\n[EW 1320\u201323]).\n\nMore\u2019s case for free deliberation \u201cusing diligence and\ntroth\u201d\u2014i.e., for genuine dialectical inquiry\u2014in\nParliament and legal matters was similar to the case he made for\ndeliberating political and theological matters. For example,\n\u201cEpigram 198: What Is the Best Form of Government?\u201d opens\nas a debate regarding which is better, a hereditary monarchy or a\nsenate. After giving arguments on both sides and after presenting the\nchoice as between one person who by \u201cblind chance\u201d is\n\u201cruler of his advisers\u201d and a group of persons\n\u201celected by the people to rule\u201d by \u201creasonable\nagreement [certum consilium]\u201d (EW 249), the\npoem\u2019s narrator abruptly ends the debate, leaving the reader to\nponder the issue.\n\nThis concern for genuine dialectical inquiry free from self-interest\nwas expressed by More most dramatically to Henry VIII after the king\nfirst asked his support in 1527 for his divorce from Queen Catherine.\nMore studied all the materials he was given, discussing them with the\nadvisors Henry identified. After doing so, he suggested to Henry that\nMore himself and Henry\u2019s other advisors might not give the king\nthe best advice because \u201cbeing all your Grace\u2019s own\nservants\u201d and because of \u201cyour manifold benefits daily\nbestowed on us\u201d, they could be \u201cinclined to deceive\nyou\u201d. Therefore, More advised Henry to consult the counselors\nmost fit to help \u201cunderstand the truth\u201d of his case:\n\u201cSaint Jerome, Saint Augustine, and diverse other old holy\ndoctors, both Greeks and Latins\u201d (Roper\u2019s Life of\nMore [EW 1399]). One of More\u2019s objectives as a\nyoung man in studying Greek had been to read the Greek Church Fathers,\nand throughout his life, he studied both the Latin and Greek\n\u201cold holy doctors and fathers\u201d to determine the\n\u201cconsent of the common Catholic Church\u201d regarding\ncontested matters (7 December <1532> letter against John Frith\n[EW 361.59, 368.36], 1529 Dialogue of Sir Thomas More,\nKnight [EW 607.28\u201355]). Even at his trial, More\nemphasized the importance of international councils to study matters,\naware of the influence exerted by national or historical interests. At\nhis trial, for example, he said:\n\n\nFor one bishop who agrees with you, I have easily a hundred, including\nsome who are among the saints. And for your one council, Parliament,\nand your statute\u2014what it is worth the great good God\nknows\u2014on my side are all the general councils celebrated during\nthe last thousand years. (1535 Guildhall Report 10 [EW\n1361])\n\n\nAt that trial, he went on to argue that England\u2019s unilateral\naction was \u201ccontrary to the unity and concord\u201d of\n\u201cthe whole Christian world\u201d (EW 1361.47\u201350,\nGuildhall Report 12)\u2014a determination More made after his\n\u201cstudy during the whole of the last seven years\u201d; he\nfinally made public this determination (after years of silence)\n\u201cfor the exoneration of my conscience\u201d (1535 Guildhall\nReport 8 [EW 1361.16\u201319]).\n",
