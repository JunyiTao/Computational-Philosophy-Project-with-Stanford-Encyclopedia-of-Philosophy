    "main_text": "Meta-mathematics || Reverse mathematics\n5.6 Reverse mathematics\n\nIn reverse mathematics one tries to establish for mathematical\ntheorems which axioms are needed to prove them. In intuitionistic\nreverse mathematics one has a similar aim, but then with respect to\nintuitionistic theorems: working over a weak intuitionistic theory,\naxioms and theorems are compared to each other. The typical axioms\nwith which one wishes theorems to compare are the fan principle and\nthe bar principle, Kripke\u2019s schema and the continuity\naxioms.\n\nIn (Veldman 2011), equivalents of the fan principle over a basic\ntheory called Basic Intuitionistic Mathematics are studied. It is\nshown that the fan principle is equivalent to the statement that the\nunit interval [0,1] has the Heine-Borel property, and from this many\nother equivalents are derived. In (Veldman 2009), the fan principle is\nshown to also be equivalent to Brouwer\u2019s Approximate Fixed-Point\nTheorem. In (Lubarsky et al. 2012), reverse mathematics is applied to\na form of Kripke\u2019s schema, which is shown to be equivalent to\ncertain topological statements.\n\nThere are many more of such examples from intuitionistic reverse\nmathematics. Especially in the larger field of constructive reverse\nmathematics there are many results of this nature that are also\nrelevant from the intuitionistic point of view.\n",
