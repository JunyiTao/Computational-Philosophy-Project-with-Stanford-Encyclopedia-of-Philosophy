    "main_text": "Phaedrus\n5. Phaedrus\n\nReaders of the Phaedrus have often wondered how the dialogue\nhangs together. The first \u201chalf\u201d seems to be about love,\nand the second about rhetoric. A slightly closer look reveals that any\nsuch simple characterization is misleading, because the first half is\nalso about rhetoric, in several different ways. To begin with, the\nfirst half of the dialogue contains explicit reflections on rhetoric;\nfor example, Socrates draws the distinction between what we would call\nthe \u201cform\u201d and the \u201ccontent\u201d of a discourse\n(235a). Still further, it consists in part in three speeches, at least\nthe first of which (\u201cLysias\u2019 speech\u201d) is a rhetorical\nset-piece. The other two are rhetorical as well, and presented as\nefforts to persuade a young beloved. All three are justly viewed as\nrhetorical masterstrokes by Plato, but for different reasons. The\nfirst is a brilliantly executed parody of the style of Lysias (an\norator and speech writer of significant repute). The second speech\nsimultaneously preserves aspects of its fictional frame (the first was\na paradoxical sounding address by a \u201cnon-lover\u201d to a\n\u201cbeloved\u201d), develops that frame (the non-lover is\ntransformed into a concealed lover), and deepens the themes in an\nimpressive and philosophically enlightening way. The third (referred\nto as the \u201cpalinode\u201d or recantation speech) contains some\nof the most beautiful and powerful images in all of Greek literature.\nIt is mostly an allegory cast in the form of a myth, and tells the\nstory of true love and of the soul\u2019s journeys in the cosmos human and\ndivine. That is, the rhetoric of the great palinode is markedly\n\u201cpoetic.\u201d Especially noteworthy for present purposes is\nthe fact that the theme of inspiration is repeatedly invoked in the\nfirst half of the dialogue; poetic inspiration is explicitly\n discussed.[27]\n\nThe themes of poetry and rhetoric, then, are intertwined in the\nPhaedrus. It looks initially as though both rhetoric and\npoetry have gained significant stature, at least relative to their\nstatus in the Ion, Republic, and Gorgias. I\nwill begin by focusing primarily on rhetoric, and then turn to the\nquestion of poetry, even though the two themes are closely connected\nin this dialogue.\n",
