    "main_text": "\n1. The Distinctiveness of Self-Knowledge\n\nWhat is special about self-knowledge, compared to knowledge in other\ndomains? Self-knowledge is thought to differ from other sorts of\nknowledge in one or more of the following ways.\n\nSelf-knowledge is especially secure, epistemically.\nSelf-knowledge is (sometimes) acquired by use of an exclusively\nfirst-personal method.\nOur capacity for self-knowledge reflects our cognitive\nagency.\nOne\u2019s pronouncements about one\u2019s own mental states\ncarry a special authority or presumption of truth.\n\n\nThe differences between these are subtle. Statement (1) identifies the\ndistinctive feature of self-knowledge as the epistemic status of a\ncertain class of beliefs, whereas statement (2) identifies it by the\nmethod one uses in forming these beliefs. Statement (3) emphasizes the\nsubject\u2019s agency, typically in relation to attitudes like\nbeliefs and intentions, which are sensitive to reasons. Statement (4)\nfocuses on the way that self-ascriptions of mental states, such as\nsaying \u201cI\u2019m in pain\u201d, are treated by others.\nStatements (1) and (2) are ways of cashing out the notion that we\nenjoy \u201cprivileged access\u201d to our own mental states. Only\nthese first two statements construe the distinctive feature of\nself-knowledge as plainly epistemic; however, most who endorse (3)\nalso claim that this agential relation grounds a special epistemic\nrelation. A minority of philosophers denies that self-knowledge is\nspecial at all (see Section 2).\n1.1 Epistemic security\n\nThe strongest epistemic claims on behalf of self-knowledge are\ninfallibility and omniscience. One is infallible about one\u2019s own\nmental states if and only if (hereafter, \u201ciff\u201d)\none cannot have a false belief to the effect that one is in a certain\nmental state. One is omniscient about one\u2019s own states\niff being in a mental state suffices for knowing that one is\nin that state. (This omniscience thesis is sometimes expressed by\nsaying that mental states are self-intimating or\nself-presenting.) Few if any contemporary philosophers\nmaintain that we are infallible or omniscient about all of our mental\nstates. Here is a simple example that challenges both infallibility\nand omniscience. Kate trusts her therapist\u2019s insights into her\nown psychology, and so she believes him when he tells her that she\ndistrusts her mother. But the therapist is mistaken\u2014in fact,\nKate trusts her mother. Hence, Kate\u2019s self-ascription I\ndistrust my mother shows that she is fallible about her own\nattitudes (mistakenly taking herself to distrust her mother) and that\nshe is not omniscient (she fails to recognize that she trusts her\nmother).\n\nIn the case described, Kate\u2019s belief about her attitude is based\non the testimony of another person. A more restricted infallibility\nthesis would limit the relevant domain to self-ascriptions based on an\nexclusively first-personal method\u2014perhaps\nintrospection. Descartes thought that we could in principle\nachieve infallibility in this circumscribed realm, but only by\nexercising meticulous care:\n\n\nThere remains sensations, emotions and appetites. These may be clearly\nperceived provided we take great care in our judgments concerning them\nto include no more than what is strictly contained in our\nperception\u2014no more than that of which we have inner awareness.\nBut this is a very difficult rule to observe, at least with regard to\nsensations. (Descartes 1644/1984: I.66, p. 216)\n\n\nA common objection to even restricted infallibility claims is the\nidea, often attributed to Wittgenstein, that where one cannot be\nwrong, one cannot be right either. For instance, Wright maintains that\nthe possibility of error is required for concept application, which is\nin turn required for substantial\nself-knowledge.\u201c[E]rror\u2014if only second-order\nerror\u2014has to be possible, if a genuine exercise of concepts is\ninvolved\u201d (Wright 1989: 634).\n\nIn its unqualified form, the omniscience thesis seems even less\nplausible than the unqualified infallibility\n thesis.[1]\n On pain of regress, omniscience seems to require that self-knowledge\nis not always a matter of grasping one mental state by being in\nanother: that is, it seems to require that some mental states\ncomprehend themselves (so to speak). James rejected this idea.\n\n\nNo subjective state, whilst present, is its own object; its object is\nalways something else. (James 1884: 2)\n\n\nSome modify the omniscience thesis by claiming that, for some states,\nanyone who is in a state of that kind is justified in believing that\nshe is, even if the thinker doesn\u2019t actually have this belief\n(Peacocke 1999; Siewert 1998; Silins 2012; Smithies 2012). Horgan and\nKriegel (2007) defend a modified omniscience thesis, based on the idea\nthat sensations are by definition conscious.\n\nOthers argue that we are infallible or omniscient about our beliefs\nand other attitudes because there is a constitutive connection between\nthe first-order attitude and the belief that one has that attitude\n(see 3.6 and 3.7). This connection varies. On some views, so long as\nwe are rational and have the relevant concepts, believing that p\nconstitutes a belief that one believes that p (Shoemaker\n1994). Others reverse the constitution relation: taking oneself to\nbelieve that p can constitute believing that\np (Coliva 2012a, Bauman 2017).\n\nClaims of infallibility and omniscience concern general relations\nbetween beliefs about mental states and those mental states\nthemselves. The most famous philosophical argument involving\nself-knowledge, Descartes\u2019 cogito argument (Descartes\n1641/1895), does not concern these general relations. Instead, it\nconcerns the certainty of a particular instance of belief.\nDescartes aims to demonstrate that, so long as you are carefully\nattending to your own thoughts, you can know with certain that\nyou\u2019re thinking\u2014and, hence, that you exist. This can be\ncertain even if there is a supremely powerful evil genius who controls\nyour thoughts and seeks to deceive you.\n\nPerhaps the most widely accepted view along these lines is that\nself-knowledge, even if not absolutely certain, is more secure,\nepistemically, than other kinds of empirical knowledge\u2014most\nobviously, perceptual knowledge. Some who take this line maintain that\nthere is a causal gap between a perceptual state and its object, and\nthis gap introduces sources of error that are absent in direct\nintrospective apprehension of a sensation (Russell 1917; Chalmers\n2003; Gertler 2012; Horgan 2012; Siewert 2012).\n1.2 Special method\n\nMost philosophers accept that there is some method of grasping\none\u2019s own mental states that is special in the sense\nthat it is available exclusively to the subject. Traditionally, this\nspecial method was construed as a kind of \u201cinward\u201d gaze,\ndirected at the mental state to be grasped.\n\nThe term \u201cintrospection\u201d\u2019\u2014literally,\n\u201clooking within\u201d\u2014captures a traditional way of\nconceiving how we grasp our own mental states. This term uses a\nspatial metaphor to express a divide between the \u201cinner\u201d\nworld of thought and the \u201cexternal\u201d world. The term\n\u201cintrospection\u201d is used in various ways in the\nself-knowledge literature. Perhaps the most common usage is that\nsuggested by the term\u2019s literal meaning: on this usage,\nintrospection is inner observation\u2014or \u201cinwardly directed\nattention\u201d (Goldman 2006: 246)\u2014that, when successful,\nyields awareness of a mental state. The notion that inner observation\nis the special method by which we achieve self-knowledge is central to\nthe acquaintance and inner sense accounts (see\n 3.1\n and\n 3.2\n below).\n\nWhile the term \u201cintrospection\u201d connotes a looking within,\na view that has recently gained prominence envisions the method unique\nto self-knowledge as requiring precisely the opposite. On this view,\nwe ascertain our own thoughts by looking outward, to the states of the\nworld they represent. This is known as the transparency\nmethod, in that self-knowledge is achieved by \u201clooking\nthrough\u201d the (transparent) mental state, directly to the state\nof the world it represents. This view is associated with a famous\npassage from Evans.\n\n\n[I]n making a self-ascription of belief, one\u2019s eyes are, so to\nspeak, or occasionally literally, directed outward\u2014upon the\nworld. If someone asks me \u201cDo you think there is going to be a\nthird world war?\u201d, I must attend, in answering him, to precisely\nthe same outward phenomena as I would attend to if I were answering\nthe question \u201cWill there be a third world war?\u201d (Evans\n1982: 225)\n\n\nThe idea that the special method by which we achieve self-knowledge\ninvolves transparency is central to empiricist transparency\naccounts (see\n 3.4)\n and to some agentialist accounts (see\n 3.7).\n1.3 Agency\n\nMany of our mental states, such as itches and tickles, are states we\nsimply undergo. But some argue that others are active. \u201cOur\nrational beliefs and intentions are not mere mental attitudes, but\nactive states of normative commitment\u201d (Korsgaard 2009: 39).\nThis idea inspires the claim, central to many versions of agentialism,\nthat the truly distinctive kind of self-knowledge is knowledge of\nthese \u201cactive states of normative commitment\u201d\n (see 3.7).\n Such self-knowledge is distinctive because believing and intending\nare things we do. According to these agentialists, this means\nthat rational beliefs and intentions are not known simply through\nobservation, which is the means by which we know other empirical\nphenomena (including sensations). \n1.4 First-person authority\n\nThe views just described take the subject to be in a special epistemic\nposition, vis-\u00e0-vis her own mental states. But a competing\napproach, sometimes attributed to Wittgenstein (Wright 1989),\nmaintains that the special authority of self-ascriptions is primarily\na matter of social-linguistic practices, which dictate that we should\ntreat subjects as authoritative about their own states. On this view,\none who responds to a self-ascription like \u201cI believe that\nit\u2019s raining\u201d with \u201cno, you don\u2019t\u201d (in\nordinary circumstances) exhibits a misunderstanding of\nsocial-linguistic norms.\n\nThe first-person authority view diagnoses the authority granted to\nself-ascriptions as deriving from social norms rather than from the\nsubject's privileged epistemic position. Strictly speaking, then, this\nposition is not concerned with self-knowledge. However, some\ncontemporary expressivist accounts (see\n 3.8)\n regard the phenomenon of first-person authority as centrally\nimportant to understanding self-knowledge.\n2. Doubts about the distinctiveness of self-knowledge\n2.1 General doubts\n\nThe idea that self-knowledge is not profoundly special was especially\nprevalent during the heyday of behaviorism. For instance, Ryle (1949)\nsuggests that the difference between self-knowledge and\nother-knowledge is at most a matter of degree, and stems from the\nmundane fact that each of us is always present to observe our own\nbehavior.\n\nDoubts about self-knowledge are also fueled by more general\nepistemological concerns, such as doubts about the possibility of\ntheory-free observations (Dennett 1991), and the familiar worry that\nthe observational process unavoidably alters the target of observation\n(Hill\n 1991).[2]\n Others argue that while self-attributions may express self-knowledge,\nthey are not epistemically superior to other kinds of beliefs.\n\n\nI suspect \u2026 [that our] judgments about the world to a large\nextent drive our judgments about our experience. Properly so, since\nthe former are the more secure. (Schwitzgebel 2008: 268)\n\n\nIn the same vein, some (including Stich 1983) deny that self-knowledge\nis special, relative to knowledge of others\u2019 states, by claiming\nthat ordinary (\u201cfolk\u201d) concepts of psychological states\nare theoretical concepts. If psychological states are theoretical\nentities, both self-ascriptions and other-ascriptions will proceed by\ninference from observed data\u2014presumably, behavior. (See the\nentry on\n folk psychology as a theory.)\n\nSkepticism of a different kind stems from a puzzle raised by\nBoghossian (1989). On most accounts, attitudes such as desires and\nbeliefs are individuated in part by their relations to other states\nand/or the\n environment.[3]\n For example, a desire for lemonade partly consists in being disposed\nto go to the refrigerator when one believes that there is lemonade\nthere, and to feeling happy at the prospect of drinking lemonade.\nBelieving there is lemonade in the refrigerator partly\nconsists in being disposed to go to the refrigerator when one desires\nlemonade, and to feeling surprise if one finds the refrigerator empty.\nMore generally, dispositional (or \u201cstanding\u201d) beliefs and desires\nconsist, partly or wholly, in dispositions to reason, behave, and\naffectively react in certain ways, relative to circumstances\n (see the entry on belief).\n Boghossian\u2019s puzzle concerns how we could have privileged\naccess to our relationally-individuated mental states. He considers\nthree ways that self-knowledge could be achieved: (a) on the basis of\ninner observation, (b) on the basis of inference, or (c) on the basis\nof nothing. He argues that (a) would not allow for knowledge of\nrelationally-individuated states, and that (b) and (c) do not provide\nfor access that is truly privileged. The result is a trilemma\nregarding self-knowledge.\n\nPhilosophers have responded to Boghossian\u2019s trilemma in a\nvariety of ways. Some deny the assumption that recognizing a\nrelationally-individuated state requires identifying the relational\nproperties that make it the state that it is (Burge 1988; Heil 1988).\nOthers argue that self-knowledge can be privileged even if it rests on\ninference (Dretske 1994; Byrne 2005; Lawlor 2009). And some maintain\nthat we can know our attitudes through introspective observation, and\nthat this weakens the case for relational construals of attitudes\n(Pitt 2004).\n2.2 Doubts based on empirical results\n\nEmpirical work in psychology constitutes another source of doubt about\nthe epistemic status of self-ascriptions. In a widely cited paper,\nNisbett and Wilson (1977) present studies showing that subjects\nroutinely misidentify the factors that influenced their reasoning\nprocesses. For instance, subjects in one study explained their\npreference for a product by its apparent quality, when in fact the\nproducts were all precisely alike: the subjects\u2019 preferences\nwere apparently driven by the product\u2019s spatial position\nrelative to its competitors seemed to drive the preferences.\n\n\nThe accuracy of subject reports is so poor as to suggest that any\nintrospective access that may exist is not sufficient to produce\ngenerally correct or reliable reports. (1977: 33)\n\n\nWhile these studies are instructive, Wilson acknowledges that their\nresults are limited in that they apply only to the unconscious sources\nof decisions; they are silent as to our privileged access to our\ncurrent states. \n\n\n[T]o the extent that people\u2019s responses are caused by the\nconscious self, they have privileged access to the actual causes of\nthese responses; in short, the Nisbett and Wilson argument was wrong\nabout such cases. (Wilson 2002: 106)\n\n\nSchwitzgebel (2002) has marshalled other sorts of empirical evidence\nto show that introspective reports are unreliable. But he has also\nsuggested that our attitudes about introspection may be particularly\nobstinate. This conclusion is borne out by his collaboration with a\npsychologist on a study of introspection using a method called\nExperience Sampling (Hurlburt and Schwitzgebel 2007). Strikingly,\ntheir careful analysis of the study\u2019s results does not resolve\ntheir differences about the reliability of introspection: Hurlburt\nremains \u201coptimistic\u201d about introspection\u2019s\nreliability while Schwitzgebel remains \u201ca skeptic\u201d).\n\nThis outcome suggests that not only careful empirical work, but also\ndifficult conceptual work, is required for determining the scope and\ndegree of introspection\u2019s reliability\u2014solving what Goldman\naptly terms \u201cthe problem of calibration\u201d (Goldman 2004:\n14). Some targets of introspection, such as sensations, can be\nidentified only through introspection itself: third-personal methods\n(for instance, identifying pain via a brain scan) depend on prior\ncorrelations between third-personal and introspective data. Goldman\nnotes that, for this reason, we can fix the range of introspective\nreliability only by using introspection and evaluating its\nresults for internal coherence and for consistency with other sources.\nBut since there is no clear consensus as to how to evaluate the\nresults of introspection, or how to weigh its results against other\nsources of evidence about mental states, the problem of calibration is\nespecially thorny and complex as it relates to introspection. Spener\n(2015) proposes that we calibrate introspection by reference to\nabilities that we could not possess unless introspection were reliable\n(relative to certain circumstances, and about certain states). For\nexample, our ability to focus binoculars on a distant object suggests\nthat introspection is reliable in identifying when things look\nblurry.\n3. Accounts of Self-Knowledge\n\nAccounts of self-knowledge vary across a number of dimensions,\nincluding: how self-knowledge is achieved; the kind and degree of\nepistemic security that self-ascriptions possess; the nature of our\n(epistemic) privilege and (social-linguistic) authority relative to\nour mental states; and the role of our observational, rational,\nagential, and expressive powers in explaining first-person privilege\nand authority.\n\nThese accounts also differ as to their scope. Acquaintance theorists\nmainly aim to explain how we know what we\u2019re currently thinking\nand feeling (our \u201coccurrent\u201d states). Reasons theorists and\nAgentialists are exclusively concerned with self-knowledge of those\nattitudes that represent our commitments, such as beliefs and\nintentions. Proponents of the Inner Sense, Self-Interpretation,\nEmpiricist Transparency, Rationalist, and Expressivist accounts differ\nas to the scope of these accounts. Each of these is taken, by at least\none of its proponents, to apply to all kinds of mental states. This\nvariety means that hybrid views are possible. For instance, one might\nthink that an Acquaintance account explains how we know our sensations\nwhile Agentialism best explains self-knowledge of beliefs.\n\nIn what follows, I proceed from broadly empiricist accounts, which\ntake self-knowledge to be a form of empirical knowledge, to accounts\nthat emphasize the role of a priori reasoning in\nself-knowledge, and finally to accounts that take the special features\nof self-knowledge to derive from our capacity for agency or\nself-expression.\n3.1 Acquaintance Accounts\n\nThe idea that we know our mental states through acquaintance\nwith them is usually associated with Russell (1917), but such accounts\ntrace their lineage at least to Descartes (see the entry on\n knowledge by acquaintance vs. description).\n According to these accounts, our awareness of our mental states is\nsometimes peculiarly direct in both an epistemic sense and a\nmetaphysical sense. It is epistemically direct in that I need not rely\non awareness of something else in order to be aware of my mental\nstate. It is metaphysically direct in that no event or process\nmediates between my awareness and the mental state itself. By\ncontrast, my awareness of last night\u2019s rain is epistemically\nindirect in that I achieve it only through being aware of something\nelse (such as the wet pavement). This awareness is metaphysically\nindirect in that various factors, including the wet pavement and\nperhaps my visual experience thereof, mediate between my awareness of\nthe rain and the rain itself.\n\nAcquaintance accounts hold special appeal for epistemic\nfoundationalists, who claim that all of our knowledge rests on a\nfoundation of beliefs that are justified, but not justified by other\nbeliefs.\n\nThe claim that introspective access is both epistemically and\nmetaphysically direct is most plausible for sensations like pain. This\nis because how a sensation appears\u2014how it seems to the\nsubject\u2014and how it actually is (its nature) are,\naccording to many philosophers, one and the same. That is,\n\u201cthere is no appearance/reality distinction in the case of\nsensations\u201d (Hill 1991: 127; compare Kripke 1980:\n152\u20133).\n\nLimiting acquaintance accounts to self-knowledge of\nsensations\u2014or, more strictly, to self-knowledge of mental states\nindividuated by phenomenology\u2014does not entirely fix their scope,\nas philosophers disagree as to which kinds of mental states are\nindividuated by phenomenology. Recently, the idea that\nthoughts have a distinctive phenomenology has received\nrenewed attention (see the entry on\n consciousness and intentionality).\n Pitt (2004) uses the fact that we seem able to know what we\u2019re\nthinking in a direct, highly secure way\u2014one that is best\nexplained by an acquaintance model of introspection\u2014to argue\nthat thoughts have distinctive phenomenological properties with which\nwe are acquainted. Some philosophers also argue that conscious\nattitudes, such as judgments, have distinctive phenomenologies.\n\nThe purported epistemic and metaphysical directness of introspection\ndoes not imply that we are either infallible or omniscient about our\nown states, since it is an open question whether all of our states are\nintrospectible. But if introspection involves epistemically and\nmetaphysically direct access to one\u2019s phenomenal states, then\nits proper use may allow the relevant self-attributions to achieve a\nhigh degree of certainty. And some philosophers have drawn on the\nconcept of acquaintance to argue that at least some mental states,\nsuch as intense sensations, may be \u201cluminous\u201d: that is, that being in\na state of that kind may ensure that one can know that one is\n(Weatherson 2004; Duncan 2018). These arguments are responses to\nWilliamson\u2019s (2000) \u201canti-luminosity\u201d argument, which seeks to\nestablish that no mental states are luminous.\n\nThe idea that we know (even some of) our sensations by acquaintance\nremains highly controversial. The idea that we know our beliefs or\nother attitudes by acquaintance is even more controversial. As James\n(1884) observed, self-knowledge requires more than even direct contact\nwith a mental state: it requires that one properly conceptualize the\nstate, classifying it as e.g. pain or coldness. The\ngreatest challenge for acquaintance accounts is to explain how this\nconceptualization occurs. In particular, they must show that awareness\nof a mental state that is direct and immediate can also be an\nepistemically substantial grasp of the state as a state of a\ncertain kind.\n\nOne approach to this challenge draws on the phenomenon of\ndemonstrative reference (Gertler 2001; Chalmers 2003). Demonstrative\nreference often involves literal pointing: by pointing to my desk, I\ncan demonstratively refer to it as \u201cthat (desk)\u201d. When it\ncomes to experiences, we don\u2019t pick them out by pointing but,\ninstead, by attending to them. As Sosa aptly observes,\n\u201cSelective attention is the index finger of the mind\u201d\n(2003: 279). By attending to how an experience feels (or appears), one\ncan use this appearance\u2014e.g., the itchiness of an itch\u2014to\nrefer to the feature demonstratively, as \u201cthis\nquality\u201d. One can then register the presence of the itch by\nthinking \u201cI\u2019m now experiencing this\nquality\u201d Since reference is secured by attending to the\nitchiness, one grasps the feature in question, as itchiness.\nChalmers refers to this grasp of phenomenal features as a\n\u201cdirect phenomenal concept\u201d.\n\n\nThe clearest cases of direct phenomenal concepts arise when a subject\nattends to the quality of an experience, and forms a concept wholly\nbased on the attention to the quality, \u201ctaking up\u201d the\nquality into the concept. (Chalmers 2003: 235)\n\n\nOne worry about acquaintance accounts stems from the observation that\nwe sometimes err about our experiences. However, most acquaintance\ntheorists will concede that we can be wrong about our own phenomenal\nstates. The theory implies only that, under certain conditions, an\nexperience\u2019s phenomenal reality\u2014the \u201cquality\u201d in\nChalmers\u2019 terms\u2014constitutes how it appears to the\nthinker\u2014the \u201cconcept\u201d of that quality (see also Horgan and\nKriegel 2007; Gertler 2012). When those conditions are met, we are\naware of the experience in a way that could not occur in the absence\nof that experience, and so our self-ascription of the experience will\nbe true.\n\nSome critics charge that acquaintance accounts construe introspective\nbeliefs as too close to their objects to qualify as genuine knowledge\n(Wittgenstein 1953; Stalnaker 2008). In effect, this objection denies\nthat direct introspective attention to an instance of a phenomenal\nquality can provide an epistemically substantial grasp of that\nquality.\n3.2 Inner Sense Accounts\n\nWhile acquaintance accounts construe introspection as fundamentally\ndifferent from perception in its epistemic and metaphysical\ndirectness, inner sense accounts take the opposite tack: they construe\nintrospection as similar to perception in crucial respects.\n\nLocke, an early inner sense theorist, described the introspective\nfaculty as follows.\n\n\nThis Source of Ideas, every Man has wholly in himself \u2026 And\nthough it be not Sense, as having nothing to do with external Objects;\nyet it is very like it, and might properly enough be call\u2019d\ninternal Sense. (Locke 1689/1975: II.1.iv.)\n\n\nInner sense accounts construe introspection as similar to perception\nin that it involves a monitoring mechanism or \u201cself-scanning\nprocess\u201d (Armstrong 1993: 324) that takes mental states as input\nand yields representations of those states as output. The monitoring\nmechanism involved in inner sense forms representations of the mental\nstates it takes as input. This process is reliable, according to some\ninner sense accounts, because the mechanism \u201credeploys\u201d\nthe content of the input state in the representation of those states\nthat is its output (Nichols and Stich 2003; Goldman 2006). On such\naccounts, and in contrast to acquaintance accounts, the connection\nbetween the introspected state (the input) and the introspective state\n(the output) is causal and contingent. But inner sense accounts allow\nthat introspection also differs from perception in significant ways.\nPerception is achieved through dedicated organs such as eyes and ears,\nwhereas there is no (literal) organ of introspection. Perception\nordinarily involves sensory experiences, whereas \u201cNo one thinks\nthat one is aware of beliefs and thoughts by having sensations or\nquasi-sense-experiences of them\u201d (Shoemaker 1994: 255).\n\nBecause inner sense accounts construe introspection as a causal\nprocess, they are particularly well-suited to reliabilist (or, more\nbroadly, epistemically externalist) approaches to self-knowledge. For\nexample, Armstrong characterizes the introspective process as \u201ca\nmere flow of information or beliefs\u201d (Armstrong 1993: 326). The\ncausal connections involved in self-monitoring need not be known by\nthe subject in order to deliver self-knowledge, and inner sense\naccounts generally regard knowledge based in introspection as\nnon-inferential. Inner sense is a first-personal method because the\nrelevant scanners or monitoring mechanisms are directed only towards\none\u2019s own states. Strikingly, however, this asymmetry of access\nis merely contingent. It is possible, in principle, for one\u2019s\n\u201cinner sense\u201d mechanism to be linked to someone\nelse\u2019s mental states, thereby allowing for \u201cdirect [read:\nnon-inferential] awareness of the mental states of others\u201d,\nthrough a kind of telepathic scanning (Armstrong 1993: 124).\n\nPerhaps the chief benefit of inner sense accounts is that they are\nespecially conducive to a broadly naturalistic picture of mentality.\nBy assimilating introspection to perception, inner sense accounts\nconstrue mentality as epistemically continuous with the nonmental, and\nthus allow a single overarching epistemology to apply to both\nself-knowledge and knowledge of external things. Since most of the\nleading arguments for mind-body dualism depend on the claim that our\nepistemic relations to mental states diverge in crucial ways from our\nepistemic relations to physical objects, the claim that the mental is\nepistemically continuous with the nonmental paves the way for\nassimilating mentality to the nonmental realm ontologically as\n well.[4]\n\nShoemaker (1994) offers a sustained critique of inner sense accounts.\nHis main objection centers on the charge that, in construing the\ncapacity for self-knowledge as similar to sensory capacities like\nvision, inner sense accounts imply that the capacity for\nself-knowledge is one that a rational person might lack. As he puts\nthis, they imply that a rational creature could be\n\u201cself-blind\u201d, unable to recognize its own mental states.\nBut, he says, self-blindness is impossible in a rational creature (at\nleast, one with ordinary mental states and who possesses mental state\nconcepts). Shoemaker\u2019s discussion has been as influential for\nits positive suggestion\u2014that our capacity for self-knowledge is\nclosely tied to rationality (see\n 3.6\n and\n 3.7)\u2014as\n for its critical treatment of inner sense accounts.\n\nKind (2003) contends that the possibility of self-blindness does not\ndirectly threaten inner sense accounts. Even if Shoemaker is right\nthat rational creatures will generally be capable of self-awareness,\nthis conclusion is silent as to how such awareness occurs. So\nit does not rule out the possibility that it is achieved through inner\nsense. Gertler (2011a: ch. 5) argues that the inner sense theorist can\nblock Shoemaker\u2019s objection by stipulating that no creature\nqualifies as rational if it is self-blind. \u201cNo rational\ncreature is self-blind\u201d would then be a de dicto truth and,\nas such, is compatible with the inner sense account. Shoemaker\u2019s\nchallenge to inner sense views requires a stronger thesis, namely that\nthe capacity for self-knowledge is a de re necessary\ncharacteristic of rational beings: that is, rational beings must be\ncapable of self-knowledge in order to exist at all.\n\nAnother objection to inner sense accounts targets their epistemic\nexternalism. Inner sense accounts are not likely to appeal to those\nwho take self-knowledge to involve internal or accessible reasons for\nbelief (Peacocke 1999: 224). \n3.3 Self-Interpretation Accounts\n\nSome philosophers maintain that grasping our beliefs and\ndesires\u2014and perhaps also our emotions\u2014requires engaging in\na process of self-interpretation (Lawlor 2009; Carruthers 2011; Cassam\n2015). Self-interpretation accounts are one response to a point\nmentioned earlier (sec.\n 2.1):\n that our attitudes are partly defined by their causal roles,\nincluding how they dispose us to reason, behave, and affectively react\n(see the entries on\n belief\n and\n desire).\n Whether a given state plays the relevant causal role seems not to be\nknowable simply by introspective observation. (This point echoes the\nfirst horn of Boghossian\u2019s trilemma. See also Peterson 2019.) We\ncan know this only by interpreting our current thoughts or feelings,\nexplaining them as manifestations of a particular belief, desire, or\nother attitude. Since this interpretive process relies on inference,\nself-interpretation accounts are sometimes labelled \u201cinferentialism\u201d.\nBut inferentialism is a broader category, encompassing some\ntransparency accounts (sec. 3.4).\n\nLawlor uses the following example. A woman named Katherine finds\nherself thinking \u201chave another\u201d as she stands by her son\u2019s crib.\nHearing those words (in \u201cinner speech\u201d) does not, on its own, provide\nher with knowledge about whether she wants to have another child. She\nmust interpret this thought: is it a genuine longing or just an idle\ndaydream? The best interpretation is the one that best explains the\nintrospected thought. Arriving at this explanation will often involve\nimaginative exercises: e.g., Katherine may imagine a newborn baby in\nher arms and, noticing that this leads her to feel happy, infer that\nshe desires another child. Lawlor\u2019s approach is supported by\nresearch suggesting that \u201cpeople can detect their nonconscious\ndispositions and motives by vividly imagining a future situation and\nattending to how it would make them feel.\u201d (Wilson and Dunn 2004,\ndescribing a study by Schultheiss and Brunstein (1999).)\n\nCarruthers\u2019 (2011) Interpretive-Sensory Access account similarly\ntakes self-knowledge to require self-interpretation. Rejecting the\nidea that there is an \u201cinner sense\u201d, a cognitive faculty dedicated\nspecifically to self-knowledge, Carruthers proposes that a single\n\u201cmindreading\u201d system detects both one\u2019s own mental\nstates and the mental states of others. In fact, he hypothesizes that\nour \u201cmindreading\u201d system \u201cevolved for outward-looking\nsocial purposes\u201d and was only later co-opted for self-knowledge\n(2011:69). This system takes sensory data as input; interprets these\ndata by drawing on situational facts and background information; and\nyields representations of mental states as output.\n\nLike the inner sense view, Carruthers\u2019 account takes the output\nof these states to qualify as knowledge on epistemically externalist\ngrounds--roughly, because of the system\u2019s reliability. By\ncontrast, Lawlor\u2019s account is friendly to epistemic internalism.\nSelf-interpretation is based on internal, accessible evidence\nincluding thoughts and feelings, as well as evidence from one\u2019s\nown behavior.\n\nThe idea that we must engage in interpretation to know our own\nattitudes and emotions echoes Ryle\u2019s (1949) view that our means\nof achieving self-knowledge is broadly similar to our means of knowing\nothers\u2019 states. In particular, self-interpretation theorists\nmaintain that, just as we know others\u2019 attitudes by inference\nfrom what they say, self-knowledge often involves inference from inner\nspeech. (I\u2019m indebted here to Byrne 2012a.) Ryle suggests that\nthe experience of inner speech is a maximally effective type of\n\u201ceavesdropping\u201d.\n\n\nWe eavesdrop on our own voiced utterances and our own silent\nmonologues. \u2026 [T]here is nothing intrinsically proprietary about\nthis activity. I can pay heed to what I overhear you saying as well as\nto what I overhear myself saying, though I cannot overhear your silent\ncolloquies with yourself. (Ryle 1949: 184)\n\n\nSelf-interpretation accounts do recognize differences between\nself-knowledge and other-knowledge. Most crucially, in our own case we\nhave access to introspective evidence (about our experiences), whereas\nour only evidence for others\u2019 states is their behavior,\nprominently including their verbal behavior. \n\nIs our access to introspective evidence also inferential, in a way\nthat threatens a regress? Self-interpretation theorists maintain that\neven understanding what you\u2019re currently feeling will require\nself-interpretation. Cassam explains this using Lawlor\u2019s\nexample: \u201cWhen you identify your feeling as the yearning for another\nchild what you are doing is interpreting it\u201d (Cassam 2015:\n163). Cassam argues that this process is holistic, as you rely on\nknowledge of your recent mental life (e.g., recently feeling envy\nabout others\u2019 pregnancies) and perhaps your recent behavior\n(going out of your way to visit a friend with a newborn) to interpret\nyour current feelings.\n\nThe self-interpretation view is compatible with the idea that we know\nsome of our states non-inferentially. Carruthers argues that\ninterpretation is not required for knowledge of any state that can be\nrecognized solely on the basis of raw sensory data, since sensory data\nare the inputs to the mindreading system. Cassam is more circumspect\nabout this possibility, pointing out that even knowledge of basic\nsensations like pains sometimes requires cognitive effort (2015:\n164).\n\nCritics of self-interpretation accounts contend that it neglects the\nprofound asymmetry between self-knowledge and other-knowledge: that\nour rationality guarantees that we have non-inferential access to our\nown attitudes (Shoemaker 1994) or that the need to engage in\nself-interpretation implies that we are alienated from our attitudes\n(Moran 2001). These claims form the basis for some rationalist and\nagentialist views (see 3.6 and 3.7).\n3.4 Empiricist Transparency Accounts\n\nTransparency accounts are inspired by the idea discussed above in\nconnection with Gareth Evans\u2019 famous remark: that if asked\nwhether you believe that there will be a third world war, you answer\nby directly considering the likelihood of a third world war. The\nmetaphor of transparency expresses the notion that one \u201clooks\nthrough\u201d the (transparent) mental state to directly consider\nwhat it represents.\n\nSome philosophers use the idea that mental states are \u201ctransparent\u201d to\nadvance rationalist or agentialist accounts of self-knowledge, which\nare non-empiricist (see 3.6\n and 3.7).\n The current subsection concerns transparency accounts that see\nEvans\u2019 procedure as generating empirical justification or\nwarrant for self-ascriptions (Dretske 1994; Fern\u00e1ndez 2003,\n2013; Byrne 2005, 2018).\n\nDretske describes self-knowledge as \u201ca form of perceptual\nknowledge that is obtained\u2014indeed, can only be obtained\u2014by\nawareness of non-mental objects\u201d (Dretske 1994: 264). E.g., I\ncan know that I\u2019m thinking it\u2019s snowing only by\ninference from my awareness of a non-mental object, such as the\nfalling snow. This account secures first-person privilege, since my\nawareness of the snow would not similarly support an inference about\nanyone else\u2019s mental state. The account requires that we rely on\nbackground beliefs to justify the inference from seeing snow to\nI\u2019m thinking that it\u2019s snowing. One worry about\nthis account is that it\u2019s not clear that the relevant background\nbeliefs will be available or justified (Aydede 2003).\n\nFern\u00e1ndez\u2019s version of the transparency account avoids\nthis worry by taking self-knowledge to be non-inferential. He argues\nthat a single state can serve as the basis for both the belief that\np and the belief that one believes that p. For\nexample, seeing snow falling will ordinarily result in the belief that\nit\u2019s snowing; this visual experience may also form the basis for\nthe self-ascription I believe that it\u2019s snowing.\nFern\u00e1ndez (2013) labels this \u201cthe bypass model\u201d, to\nindicate that it takes self-attributions of belief to be based\ndirectly on the basis for the first-order belief,\n\u201cbypassing\u201d the first-order belief itself. The\nself-ascription is justified in a way that is \u201cpartly\ninternalist\u201d (ibid.: 44) in that I have access to the basis for\nmy belief that I believe that it\u2019s snowing, namely the fact that\nI (seem to) see falling snow. The account is also \u201cpartly externalist\u201d\n(ibid): my self-ascription is warranted because my perceptual state\nthat is its basis tends to correlate with the belief that it\u2019s\nsnowing.\n\nThe bypass method is exclusively first-personal, since only I can base\na belief directly on my perceptual state. And it is more\nsecure than others\u2019 knowledge of my mental states. Others know\nmy states only by inference\u2014from my behavior, and/or their\nobservations of the evidence available to me. But self-knowledge that\nsatisfies the bypass model is non-inferential, since the\nself-ascription (e.g., the belief that I believe that it\u2019s\nsnowing) is not inferred from its basis (e.g., seeing falling\nsnow).\n\nBy contrast, Byrne\u2019s (2005, 2018) transparency account is\nexplicitly inferentialist. He claims that we know our beliefs by\nreasoning according to the \u201cdoxastic schema\u201d (Gallois\n1996). \n\n\\[\\frac{p}{\\mbox{I believe that } p}\\]\n\n\nByrne argues as follows. To reason in accord with the doxastic schema\nis to infer I believe that p from the premise p; one\ndoes not infer from a premise unless one believes the premise; so such\nreasoning will yield true self-ascriptions. The doxastic schema is\nthus\n self-verifying.[5]\n And it is self-verifying regardless of whether the premise is\njustified, or even whether the thinker regards it as justified.\n\nByrne\u2019s main thesis, that self-knowledge is achieved through use\nof the doxastic schema, rests on two basic claims. The first claim is\nthat it\u2019s independently plausible that we actually use the\ndoxastic schema (as Evans\u2019 remarks suggest). The second claim is\nthat the hypothesis that we use the doxastic schema best explains the\nspecial security and asymmetry of self-knowledge. On his proposal, the\nspecial epistemic security of self-knowledge is a matter of\nexternalist warrant: the doxastic schema is not only self-verifying\nbut also yields self-ascriptions that are \u201csafe\u201d in that\nthey could not easily have been\n false.[6]\n The asymmetry of self-knowledge consists in the fact that following\nthis schema will not yield knowledge of others\u2019 states.\nReasoning from it\u2019s snowing to you/they believe\nthat it\u2019s snowing will not reliably yield true\nbeliefs about others\u2019 beliefs.\n\nOne objection to transparency accounts is that answering the question\n\u201cDo you believe that p?\u201d by directly considering\nwhether p may not shed light on what one believed before the\nquestion arose (Shah and Velleman 2005). For example, to answer the\nquestion \u201cDo you believe that there will be a third world\nwar?\u201d by considering geopolitical matters may produce a new\nbelief rather than revealing a pre-existing belief. In general,\nreflection on accessible evidence about whether p may\nactually change a pre-existing belief on this issue (Wilson and Kraft\n1993). The transparency theorist cannot avoid this worry by\nstipulating that, when considering whether p, one should not\ndraw a new conclusion. Avoiding new conclusions would require\nalready knowing one\u2019s beliefs, that is, which conclusions one\nhad already drawn.\n\nTransparency theorists can respond by arguing that the objection\nmisconstrues the aim of these accounts. The objection charges that the\naccount may not explain first-person access: how it is that,\nif you believe that p, you can know that you do. Transparency\naccounts may be intended to address a different question, namely, what\nkind of exclusively first-personal method could deliver\nself-ascriptions that constitute knowledge. And even if considering\ngeopolitical matters produced a new belief that a third world war is\nlikely, the inference that Byrne describes\u2014from a third\nworld war is likely to I believe that a third world war is\nlikely\u2014would arguably yield self-knowledge. Still, the\nobjection exposes a possible limitation of transparency accounts.\nBecause they cannot distinguish newly-formed judgments from previous\ndispositional beliefs, they cannot account for our apparent ability to\nknowledgeably answer the question \u201cDo you believe that\np?\u201d, where that question concerns what one believes at\nthe time the question is posed (Gertler 2011b).\n\n\nAnother objection concerns these accounts\u2019 presumption that\nself-knowledge need not meet epistemically internalist conditions on\nknowledge. Boyle (2011) targets Byrne\u2019s view on this point,\narguing that even if the inference from p to I believe\nthat p reliably yields true (and safe) self-ascriptions, this\ninference cannot explain self-knowledge since it will not appear\nreasonable to the thinker: after all, in general the fact\nthat p doesn\u2019t imply that I believe\nthat p. Fern\u00e1ndez addresses this worry, in arguing\nthat beliefs formed through the bypass method will seem reasonable to\nthe subject. Other critics argue that the transition from p\nto I believe that p is not a genuine inference. Valaris\n(2011) argues that, unlike genuine inferences, this transition cannot\nbe used in hypothetical contexts\u2014e.g., when one reasons from a\npremise one doesn\u2019t believe, to see what follows from\nit. Barnett (2016) argues that this transition violates plausible,\nbroadly evidentialist restrictions on inferences.\n\nFern\u00e1ndez limits his account to explaining self-knowledge of\nbeliefs and desires, while Byrne extends his account to encompass\nself-knowledge of all of our mental states. Critics express skepticism\nabout extending the transparency account beyond beliefs: to desires\n(Ashwell 2013a, 2013b), to thoughts or intentions (Samoilova 2016), or\nto beliefs held with less than 100% confidence (Tang 2017).\n3.5 Reasons Accounts\n\nAbove, we saw that on standard views of beliefs and desires, these\nattitudes are at least partly constituted by dispositions to reason,\nbehave, and affectively react. This is one basis for thinking that\nself-knowledge of attitudes must be inferential. After all,\ndispositions seem to be linked with counterfactual truths, and such\ntruths can be known only through inference.\n\nThe reasons account of self-knowledge, first advanced by\nPeacocke (1999), says that we can sometimes know our beliefs without\nrelying on inference. While beliefs are dispositional states,\njudgments are occurrent: a judgment that p is an\nevent. Peacocke argues that judging it\u2019s\nsnowing (say) provides you with a reason to think that you have\nthe dispositions associated with the belief that it\u2019s\nsnowing\u2014e.g., to put on boots when leaving the house (if you\ndesire dry feet). In other words, Peacocke thinks that judging\nit\u2019s snowing gives you reason to believe that you\nbelieve that it\u2019s snowing.\n\nNotably, on this view the judgment can serve as a reason for the\ncorresponding self-ascription of belief so long as the judgment is\nconscious. You need not be aware of the judgment. An analogy\nmay illuminate the basic idea here. An itch can serve as a reason for\nscratching even if there is no further conscious state (distinct from\nthe itch) that constitutes an awareness of the itch. Peacocke\nargues that, in a broadly similar way, a conscious judgment that\np can serve as a direct reason for my self-ascribing the\nbelief that p, without my introspecting the judgment and\ninferring that I believe that p, or even having any distinct\nawareness of that judgment. (Compare Silins 2012.)\n\nThe non-inferential transition from judging that p (a\nconscious, occurrent state) to believing that one believes that\np (that is, to self-ascribing a belief) is a rational one, on\nthis view, because judging is conceptually linked with believing:\nmaking a judgment \u201cis the fundamental way to form a\nbelief\u201d (Peacocke 1999: 238). Similarly, since remembering that\np is conceptually linked with believing that p, a\nconscious memory that p can justify the belief that one\nbelieves that p. And anyone in a position to self-ascribe a\nbelief will possess the concept of belief, and so will grasp\u2014or\nat least, manifest cognitive dispositions appropriately\nreflecting\u2014these conceptual\n truths.[7]\n\nDrawing on Peacocke, Paul (2012) develops a reasons account of how we\nknow our intentions. On this account, the transition from deciding to\ndo something (or remembering that one has so decided) to believing\nthat one intends to do that thing is rational, since it is a\nconceptual truth that deciding normally suffices for intending.\n\nSilins (2020) presents a different argument for the reasons account as\napplied to belief. He thinks that judgments like it\u2019s\nsnowing but I don\u2019t believe that it is\u2014known as\n\u201cMoore-paradoxical judgments\u201d\u2014are plainly irrational. But if the\njudgment that p didn\u2019t provide justification for\nself-ascribing the belief that p, these judgments could be\nperfectly rational. Silins concludes that judging that p\nprovides (propositional) justification for self-ascribing the belief\nthat p. This explains why Moore-paradoxical judgments are\nirrational: in making such a judgment \u201cyou flout the justification\ngiven to you by your judgment that p\u201d (Silins 2020: 334).\n\nColiva (2008) objects that judgments cannot rationalize\nself-ascriptions of belief in the way the reasons theorist contends,\nbecause they are not suitably accessible. Her argument rests, in part,\non a claim reminiscent of the self-interpretation view: that the\nphenomenology of a conscious thought\u2014such as \u201cthings will\nlook up\u201d\u2014does not indicate whether this is the content of\na judgment or, instead, of a wish. McHugh (2012) responds on behalf of\nthe reasons account, arguing that there is a \u201cphenomenology\ncharacteristic of judging that p\u201d that is present in\ncases where ordinary self-knowledge is possible (2012: 148). This\ndispute suggests that the prospects for the reasons account, as an\naccount of self-knowledge of the attitudes, may depend in part on\nwhether attitudes have \u201cproprietary phenomenology\u201d (Pitt\n2004). (For more on that question, see the entry on\n consciousness and intentionality.)\n3.6 Rationalist Accounts \n\nRationalist accounts of self-knowledge maintain that our status as\nrational thinkers guarantees our capacity for self-knowledge. Some\nagentialist accounts (discussed in the next subsection) agree with\nthat claim, but on agentialist views this guarantee stems from the\nagency exercised in rational deliberation. I reserve the term\n\u201crationalist\u201d for accounts that focus on rationality and\nare independent of claims about agency. As we saw in\n 3.2,\n Shoemaker (1994) contends that no rational thinker (who possesses the\nrelevant mental state concepts) could be \u201cself-blind\u201d, that is,\nincapable of self-knowledge. He reasons as follows. A self-blind\nperson would (i) fall into certain conceptual errors, such as making\nirrational Moore-paradoxical judgments like it\u2019s snowing but\nI don\u2019t believe that it is; (ii) be unable to communicate\ntheir beliefs, and hence to engage in cooperative endeavors; (iii)\nregard themselves \u201cas a stranger\u201d, e.g. in observing themselves taking\naspirin without grasping that they were in pain. Yet a rational\nthinker would not commit these errors, be incapacitated in this way,\nor suffer this kind of self-alienation. So rational thinkers cannot be\nself-blind.\n\n\nShoemaker explains the link between rationality and self-knowledge\nwith his \u201cconstitutivist\u201d\n [8]\n thesis, namely: for rational thinkers with the appropriate conceptual\nrepertoire, being in certain mental states constitutes\nknowledge that one is in them. What it is for a rational creature to\nfeel pain is, in part, for that creature to believe that they are in\npain; what it is for a rational creature to believe that p\nis, in part, for it to believe that it believes that p; etc.\nShoemaker cashes out this idea with a functionalist analysis of mental\nstates, proposing that in rational creatures, the causal role defining\na mental state are also sufficient for belief that one is in that\nmental state (Shoemaker 1994: 287\u20139).\n\nInspired in part by Shoemaker\u2019s arguments, Stoljar (2018, 2019)\nhas recently proposed an ambitious, systematic explanation of the\n(supposed) fact that rational thinkers are necessarily capable of\nself-knowledge. Stoljar posits that what it means to be\nrational is to be guided by the rules of rationality, which\ninclude the following \u201cintrospective principle\u201d:\n\n\nIf one is in a conscious state C, \u2026 one will believe that one is in\nC. (Stoljar 2019: 405; ellipsis in original)\n\n\n(The ellipsis indicates that further conditions must be added; the\ndetails are not crucial here.) If rationality partly consists in\nfollowing this principle, then no rational creature will be\nself-blind. Stoljar (2019) argues that his proposal also explains why,\nas Evans claimed, we can know that we believe that p by\nconsidering p. He proposes that a belief is conscious, in the\nrelevant sense, when one attends to its content\u2014e.g., to\nit\u2019s snowing. Together with the introspective principle\nabove, this means that a rational person who believes that p,\nand who attends to p, will believe that they believe that\np.\n\nSmithies (2019) also defends the idea that rational thinkers are\nnecessarily capable of knowing their beliefs. His starting point is\nthe claim that Moore-paradoxical beliefs are always irrational. He\nnotes that such beliefs may seem rational if a thinker\ndoesn\u2019t know what they believe: e.g., if someone believes that\np but has misleading evidence suggesting that they\ndon\u2019t believe that p. Smithies concludes that, since\nsuch beliefs are always irrational, a rational thinker will know all\nof their beliefs. \u201cRationality requires knowing what you believe,\nsince otherwise you\u2019re liable to fall into an irrational Moorean\npredicament\u201d (ibid.: 174). To explain how we are able to know all of\nour beliefs, he proposes a nonstandard conception of belief: \u201cto\nbelieve that p is to be disposed to judge that p\nwhen you consciously entertain whether p\u201d (ibid.: 175\u20136).\nGiven that conception, beliefs are necessarily accessible to the\nsubject, since they consist in dispositions to conscious judgments.\nThis means that a rational thinker who believes that p will\nhave (available) justification for believing that they believe that\np.\n\nRationalist accounts face two related challenges. First, to defend the\nidea that rationality guarantees the capacity for self-knowledge,\nthese accounts must adopt a fairly demanding conception of what it is\nto be rational. But if a conception of rationality is too demanding,\nthen it is questionable whether it applies to cognitively flawed\ncreatures like us (Kornblith 2012; Cassam 2015). Second, in order to\nexplain how we can meet their demanding standards for\nrationality\u2014how we can follow Stoljar\u2019s introspective\nprinciple, or can know all of our beliefs\u2014rationalists tend to\ninvoke nonstandard conceptions of \u201cconscious\u201d or \u201cbelief\u201d. The\nchallenge here is to show that the process of achieving self-knowledge\nis psychologically realistic and that it applies to the kinds of\nstates that we actually possess.\n\nMany philosophers share the intuition that, necessarily, no rational\nthinker is self-blind. The success of rationalist accounts of\nself-knowledge depends on whether there are conceptions of\nrationality, consciousness, belief, etc. that are robust enough to\nexclude the possibility of self-blindness yet psychologically\nrealistic enough to explain the cognitive achievements of actual human\nbeings.\n3.7 Agentialist Accounts\n\nThe accounts of self-knowledge canvassed thus far treat self-knowledge\nas a largely epistemic phenomenon. But as noted in\n Section 1,\n some philosophers deny that the special character of self-ascriptions\nis primarily epistemic. One version of this denial charges that by\nfocusing on our access to our mental states, standard\naccounts of self-knowledge portray the introspective thinker as\npassive, a mere spectator (or detector) of a cognitive show.\nAgentialists contend that the special character of self-knowledge\nstems from the fact that we exercise agency over our mental states,\nand hence are responsible for them. \n\n\nThe privilege of first-person knowledge is \u2026 really more like the\nknowledge of a person driving a car as opposed to that of her\npassenger. The passenger may very well see where the driver is going,\nbut still does not know in the immediate executive sense of\nthe driver herself. (McGeer 1996: 505)\n\nThe phenomena of self-knowledge \u2026 are themselves based as much\nin asymmetries of responsibility and commitment as they are in\ndifference in capacities or in cognitive access. (Moran 2001: 64)\n\n\nMany versions of agentialism are inspired by a broadly Kantian\napproach to reason and agency (Burge 1996; Moran 2001; Bilgrami 2006;\nBoyle 2009). On this approach, a thinker\u2019s most basic\nself-conception (as an \u201cI\u201d) is agential: we see ourselves\nas authors of our beliefs and intentions, rather than as an\ninert thing in which attitudes merely occur. This authorial agency is\nessentially rational: it is exercised when we believe or intend on the\nbasis of reasons. Agentialism differs from rationalism in taking our\ncapacity for self-knowledge to derive from our agency and not (just)\nfrom our rationality. Agentialists maintain that our rational agency\nguarantees that we are capable of\u2014or even that we\npossess\u2014self-knowledge.\n\nAgentialists differ as to the precise link between agency and\nself-knowledge. I begin with Burge, who argues that our responsibility\nfor our beliefs entitles us to belief self-ascriptions. Burge\nuses the following reasoning. Our rational agency confers on us the\nobligation to (try to) satisfy certain rational norms: that\none\u2019s beliefs should conform to one\u2019s evidence; that a\nbelief set should be internally consistent; etc. In order to satisfy\nthese rational norms\u2014e.g., to assess our beliefs for conformance\nwith our evidence, or for consistency with other beliefs\u2014we must\nrely on judgments as to which beliefs we have. So our responsibility\nto satisfy rational norms epistemically entitles us to those judgments\nabout our beliefs (and other attitudes) that are crucial for\nsatisfying those norms.\n\n\n[I]f one lacked entitlement to judgments about one\u2019s attitudes,\none could not be subject to rational norms governing how one ought to\nalter those attitudes given that one had reflected on them. (Burge\n1996:\n 101)[9]\n\n\nThis appears to be a version of \u201cought implies can\u201d reasoning. The\nupshot is that being responsible for one\u2019s attitudes requires,\nand thereby implies, that we can know those attitudes. \n\nBurge's reasoning has a distinctly transcendental flavor (see the\nentry on\n transcendental arguments).\n Transcendental reasoning also fuels Moran\u2019s agentialism. But\nwhile Burge uses it to establish a general entitlement to\nself-ascriptions, Moran deploys it to show that self-knowledge can be\nachieved in a specific way, namely by reflection on reasons. He\nreasons as follows. We could not engage in rational thought unless we\nhad the \u201cepistemic right\u201d to the assumption that our attitudes are\nshaped by our reasons. (This is \u201csomething like a Transcendental\nassumption of Rational Thought\u201d (Moran 2003: 406).) So we do\nhave the epistemic right to that assumption. And our right to that\nassumption gives us the epistemic right to use the transparency method\nassociated with Evans\u2019 famous remarks: to answer the question\n\u201cdo you believe that p?\u201d by considering reasons bearing\non p (ibid.) So the self-ascriptions produced by the\ntransparency method constitute knowledge.\n\nMoran\u2019s agentialist transparency account differs markedly from\nempiricist transparency accounts\n (3.4).\n For empiricists, the transparency method provides for self-knowledge\nbecause it is reliable or generates self-ascriptions that could not\neasily be false. For agentialists, our entitlement to use the\ntransparency method is rooted in a normative fact: that we are\nresponsible for our attitudes.\n\nSome worry that Moran\u2019s account is too demanding. O\u2019Brien\nargues that I am not justified in self-attributing the belief that\nthere will be a third world war, on the basis of considering\ngeopolitics, unless I recognize that my reasons for expecting a third\nworld war constitute evidence that I believe it will occur. But this\nrecognition in turn requires a reflective grasp of the nature of\ndeliberation that seems unnecessary for ordinary self-attributions\n(O\u2019Brien 2003: 379\u201381).\n\nOther philosophers have supplemented Moran\u2019s argument by\nclaiming that the agentialist transparency account is needed to make\nsense of various phenomena. Keeling (2018) cites the fact that we\nconfabulate reasons for our attitudes (Nisbett and Wilson 1977) as\nshowing that, as rational agents, we take ourselves to be obligated to\nknow the rational basis for our attitudes, and hence to be justified\nin taking our attitudes to reflect our reasons. Marcus and Schwenkler\n(2019) argue that we cannot satisfy the honesty norm for assertions\nunless we have non-empirical knowledge of what we believe, of the sort\nprovided by the transparency method.\n\nLike Burge and Moran, Bilgrami (2006) regards self-knowledge as\nintimately tied to the phenomenon of rational agency. But his view is\nnot merely that, as rational agents, we are necessarily capable of\nknowing our attitudes. He argues that we could not exercise the agency\ninvolved in believing unless we actually knew our beliefs.\nBeliefs are necessarily known by the thinker because they are\ncommitments.\n\n\n[C]ommitments [such as beliefs] \u2026 are states that, were we not\nto live up to them, we should be prepared to criticize ourselves and\nbe prepared also to try and do better, by way of living up to them\n\u2026 We cannot therefore have commitments without believing that\nwe have them. \u2026 Thus the very condition for having a commitment\npresupposes that one has a second-order belief that one has that\ncommitment. (2006: 287)\n\n\nBoyle also thinks that our responsibility for our attitudes means that\nwe must be generally aware, at least tacitly, of our conscious\nbeliefs. The capacity to deliberate about whether p requires\nan awareness of how p is being represented: e.g., awareness\nthat it is represented as a settled matter, as opposed to a hypothesis\nto be examined (Boyle 2019: 1034). This means that a rational thinker\nwho consciously believes that p has a tacit awareness of that\nbelief. Importantly, for Boyle this awareness is not higher-order: the\nbelief that p is not an object of a separate state\nof awareness. Instead, it is an in-built awareness:\n\n\n[F]or a person who consciously believes that p, being aware\nof her own belief and seeing the world from the perspective of\np-believer are two aspects of the same awareness. (ibid.:\n1018)\n\n\nThe agentialist views discussed thus far have been inspired by the\nKantian idea that we are responsible for our beliefs and intentions\nbecause, in believing or intending, we exercise a distinctive type of\nagency, viz. rational agency. Whether positive this\ndistinctive type of agency is needed to explain the epistemic and\nnormative aspects of self-knowledge invoked by agentialists is a\nmatter of controversy (Gertler 2018; Sorgiovanni 2019).\n\nSome agentialist views are independent of the idea that our attitudes\nare exercises of rational agency. McGeer\u2019s (1996) view, a\npioneer of empiricist agentialism, takes self-ascriptions to be\n\u201ccommissive\u201d: in self-ascribing an attitude, we commit to behaving in\nways that fit that attitude.\n\n\n[W]e are actors as well as observers and so can be good, even\nexcellent, \u201cpredictors\u201d of our future behavior because we\nhave the power to make these \u201cpredictions\u201d come true. \u2026 [W]e do not\njust wait to see if our actions make sense in light of intentional\nself-attributions, but rather make them make sense. (McGeer\n1996: 507)\n\n\nMcGeer\u2019s account does not invoke the idea of rational agency.\nThis means that it does not rest on positing a distinctive agential\nfaculty, and allows its scope to extend beyond reasons-sensitive\nattitudes such as beliefs and intentions. For example, saying (or\njudging) \u201cI want to go to the beach\u201d commits one to act in ways that\nmake sense given that desire: e.g., to go to the beach when an\nopportunity presents itself. The normativity of this commitment stems\nnot from the requirements of rationality but, instead, from our\nordinary practical obligations. In expressing an attitude, we provide\nothers with ways of explaining and predicting our behavior; this\nobligates us to behave in ways that fit the attitudes we express or\nself-ascribe (or to convey that our attitudes have changed). \n\nColiva (2012a) develops a related view concerning self-ascriptions of\ncommitments\u2014which for her include not only beliefs and\nintentions but also rationally held conative attitudes, such as\ndesires. Provided that a thinker is rational and has the relevant\nconcepts, their self-ascriptions of commitments will be true because\nthey will create the attitudes ascribed.\n\n\n[A] judgement (or a sincere assertion) such as \u2028\u201cI\nbelieve/desire/intend/wish/hope that P\u201d is like a\nperformative, namely like \u201cI promise to buy you an\nice-cream\u201d\u2026 : it makes a certain thing happen,\nfor it does create the first-order propositional attitude as a\ncommitment. \u2026 [J]udging \u201cI\nbelieve/desire/intend/wish/hope that P\u201d becomes just an\nalternative way of undertaking the same commitments one would make by\njudging that P (is worth pursuing or having)\u2026 (Coliva\n2012a: 235\u20136)\n\n\nThe agency operative in Coliva\u2019s account is our power to\nundertake commitments through self-ascriptions. This contrasts with\nthe kind of agency at work in Kantian agentialist views, which is\nexercised simply in having beliefs or intentions. However,\nColiva\u2019s account still has a rationalist element in that\nself-ascriptions involve committing to there being good\nreasons for the attitude.\n\nWe now consider the prospects for agentialism generally. The\nagentialist\u2019s primary burden is to explain the epistemic\ndimension of self-knowledge. After all, most cases of knowledge\ninvolve a belief being controlled by what is known: e.g., I know my\ndog\u2019s location only if my belief about his location is\ncontrolled by (sensitive to) his actual location. By contrast, the\nagential approach focuses on our control over what is known.\nAgentialism is not a genuine competitor to the accounts of\nself-knowledge unless it explains how agency relative to our attitudes\nprovides for self-knowledge. (Parrott\u2019s (2015) non-epistemic\nversion of agentialism is explicitly not a competitor to those\naccounts, as its aim is to explain why it is reasonable to defer to\nothers\u2019 self-ascriptions.) Because the various versions of\nagentialism differ as to the way that agency secures justification or\nwarrant for self-ascriptions, their responses to this challenge will\ndiffer.\n\nA possible drawback of agentialism is its limited application. Most\nversions of agentialism apply only to attitudes are sensitive to\nreasons. (McGeer\u2019s is an exception.) But arguably,\nnon-instrumental desires and some other types of attitudes are\ninsensitive to reasons: this is part of the motivation for\nself-interpretation accounts (3.3). And some beliefs and intentions\nare insensitive to reasons. Beliefs that are deeply entrenched (such\nas superstitions) or comforting (as in wishful thinking) sometimes\npersevere in the face of counter-evidence. Intentions that run counter\nto one\u2019s goals (e.g. akratic or self-sabotaging intentions)\nsometimes withstand practical deliberation.\n\nAgentialists generally hold that we can know such recalcitrant\nattitudes, but only through a process of self-observation, which they\nregard as problematic. (McGeer is again an exception.) Agentialists\nargue that if I can know about my own attitude only through\nobservation, then I am \u201calienated\u201d (Moran 2001) from that\nattitude; my relation to it, qua agent, is \u201cbrute, contingent,\nnon-rational\u201d (Burge 1996); and I can view it only from a\n\u201cthird-person perspective\u201d (Bilgrami 2006) and not\n\u201cas my own\u201d (Boyle\n 2009).[10]\n Some of agentialism\u2019s critics maintain that knowing an attitude\nthrough an observational process does not preclude a thinker from\nregarding it as her own in the relevant sense (Reed 2010;\nBorgoni 2015). Some even claim that a detached perspective on\none\u2019s own attitudes can be especially enlightening: it can help\nus to recognize and combat recalcitrant attitudes (McGeer 2008; Levy\n2016), and it may be necessary for genuine self-understanding (Doyle\n2019). \n3.8 Expressivist Accounts \n\nExpressivist views highlight similarities between utterances like\n\u201cI\u2019m in pain\u201d and direct expressions of one\u2019s\nmental states, such as wincing or saying \u201couch!\u201d\n(Wittgenstein 1953; Finkelstein 2003; Bar-On 2004; Campbell 2020). In\nparticular, these views center on the idea that utterances like\n\u201cI\u2019m in pain\u201d\u2014avowals\u2014directly\nexpress the mental states they ascribe. The most radical version of\nexpressivism\u2014what Bar-On (2004) calls Simple Expressivism,\nsometimes attributed to Wittgenstein\u2014says that avowals, like\nnon-linguistic expressions of mental states such as wincing, are\nneither true nor false. On that view, avowals do not express\nknowledge any more than wincing does. Most contemporary\nexpressivists take avowals to express self-knowledge. Since our\nconcern is with self-knowledge, our discussion will be limited to\nthose views.\n\nAvowals include thoughts like I want some water as well as\nutterances like \u201cI\u2019m in pain\u201d. According to the expressivist,\nthe relation between an avowal and the mental state it expresses is\ndirect in two respects. First, no judgment to the effect that\nI\u2019m in pain or desire water intervenes between my pain or desire\nand my avowal. Just as a wince flows from my pain directly, a\nspontaneous avowal flows from my pain (or desire) directly, unmediated\nby any judgment. Second, the knowledge expressed in such avowals is\nepistemically \u201cgroundless\u201d in that it is not based on\nevidence that one is in pain or desires water. Obviously, the\nsubject can directly express only her own mental states.\n\nExpressivist approaches differ as to the feature of avowals that they\naim to explain. Finkelstein and Bar-On focus on the social-linguistic\naspect of avowals, known as first-person authority: we ordinarily\ndefer to others about their own mental states, so avowals are presumed\nto be true. Campbell focuses on the epistemic aspect of avowals, known\nas first-person privilege: our capacity to avow our mental states\nconstitutes a privileged epistemic position vis-a-vis those\nstates.\n\nFinkelstein allows that my avowal \u201cI\u2019m so happy!\u201d\nmay be caused by my happiness. But he denies that this is a matter of\nbrute causation, as hitting someone\u2019s knee with a hammer brutely\ncauses his leg to kick out. Rather, what differentiates these cases is\nthat my happiness and my spontaneous avowal \u201chave, we might say, a\nparticular kind of intelligibility\u201d (Finkelstein 2003: 126). This does\nnot mean that my happiness rationalizes the avowal. (A relevant\ncontrast here is with the reasons account.) Instead, he says, my\navowal, like my smiling, makes sense together with my happiness in\nsomething like the way that a dog\u2019s pain and its moaning make\nsense together, in \u201cthe logical space of animate life\u201d.\n\n\nSince dogs are not usually thought to possess self-knowledge, this\nanalogy raises the question: Does my avowal \u201cI\u2019m\nhappy\u201d express knowledge that I\u2019m happy? The\nanswer is complex, on Finkelstein\u2019s view. Whether the avowing\nsubject is to be credited with self-knowledge depends, he thinks, on\nhow one understands \u201cknowledge\u201d: in particular, avowals do\nnot express knowledge if knowledge requires an epistemic grounding in\nevidence.\n\nBar-On\u2019s account focuses on the fact that avowals enjoy a\npresumption of truth. To use one of her examples: if I say\n\u201cI\u2019m so happy!\u201d, it would be inappropriate (in\nordinary circumstances) for you to question whether I am the\none who is happy, or whether what I\u2019m feeling is\nhappiness. This presumption of truth is explained, on\nBar-On\u2019s account, by the fact that my avowal flows directly from\nmy happy feeling. That is, my avowal is not based on evidence about\nhow I feel, and no judgment to the effect that I\u2019m happy\nmediates between my happiness and the avowal.\n\nBar-On maintains that avowals can represent \u201cgenuine and\nprivileged self-knowledge\u201d (Bar-On 2004: 405), although the\navowing subject typically has not \u201cformed the active judgment\n[that he is happy] on some basis\u201d, and cannot offer evidence\nbearing on his happiness (ibid.: 363). She is not committed to a\nparticular account of how avowals constitute knowledge, but\nshe presents a number of approaches compatible with her view, which\nshe calls Neo-Expressivism.\n\nOn one of these approaches, a conscious state can provide epistemic\nwarrant for a self-ascription directly, in the two senses of\ndirectness mentioned earlier: that is, without mediation by a judgment\nand without serving as evidence for the avowal. \n\n\n[A]vowing subjects enjoy a special epistemic warrant, since their\npronouncements, when true, are epistemically grounded in the very\nstates they ascribe to themselves, which states also serve as the\nreasons for their acts of avowing. (Bar-On 2004: 405)\n\n\n(By \u201cepistemically grounded\u201d, Bar-On simply means\nwarranted: such avowals are not based on evidence.)\n\nAlthough both Finkelstein and Bar-On maintain that avowals may qualify\nas knowledge, providing an epistemology of self-knowledge is, for\nthem, at most a peripheral goal. These views are concerned with\navowals that issue directly from the states they express, in something\nlike the way a dog's moaning issues directly from its pain. But to\nsome critics, this spontaneous, reflexive quality of\navowals\u2014that they are not informed by evidence or\nreasoning\u2014means that they cannot represent to the kind of\nepistemic achievement required for knowledge.\n\nCampbell (2020) draws on the idea at the core of\nexpressivism\u2014that only the subject can directly express their\nmental states\u2014to explain our special epistemic position relative\nto our own mental states. Her account contrasts with\nFinkelstein\u2019s and Bar-On\u2019s in taking the epistemic\ndimension of avowals (first-person privilege) to be the basis for\ntheir social-linguistic dimension (first-person authority).\n\nCampbell proposes that an avowal like \u201cI\u2019m in pain\u201d can express\nnot only pain but also knowledge that I\u2019m in\npain (2020: 15). This proposal draws on her Rational Response account\nof knowledge, which says that knowing that p is \u201cbeing able\nto rationally respond to or operate with, the fact\nthat p\u201d (ibid.: 12). On this account, to know that I want\nwater is to have the rational capacities to act on, express, and\nreason with my desire for water. I exercise these capacities when I\nrationally respond to my desire in any of a variety of ways: pouring\nmyself a glass of water, or altering my route so that I will pass a\ndrinking fountain, or saying \u201cI want some water\u201d. The utterance \u201cI\nwant some water\u201d expresses self-knowledge, of the uniquely\nfirst-personal kind, if it is a direct, rational response to my desire\nfor water. This response must be direct in the ways described\nearlier: not based on an intermediate judgment or on evidence about my\ndesire. The requirement that it be rational distinguishes\nexpressions of self-knowledge from brute reactions, e.g. a dog\u2019s\nresponding to his thirst by going to his water bowl.\n\nThis last point highlights an aspect of Campbell\u2019s account that\ndeserves further discussion. The account rests on distinguishing\nrational responses to the fact that p from non-rational (or\n\u201cbrute\u201d) reactions. If the account is to explain rather than\npresuppose first-person privilege, what makes a response\nrational must not be analyzed in epistemic terms. E.g., the\nrationality of a response must not lie in its being justified or\nwarranted. This is a fruitful area for future work on this new\ncontribution to the self-knowledge literature.\n",
