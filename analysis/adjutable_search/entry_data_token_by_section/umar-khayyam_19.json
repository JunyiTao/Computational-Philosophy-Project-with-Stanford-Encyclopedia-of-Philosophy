    "main_text": "Khayyam the Mathematician and Scientist || Root Calculations and the Binomial Theorem\n4.3 Root Calculations and the Binomial Theorem\nWe know that Khayyam wrote a treatise, now lost, titled \u201cProblems of Arithmetic,\u201d involving the determination of \\(n\\)-th roots (Youschkevitch and Rosenfeld 1973, 325\u2013326). In his Algebra Khayyam writes that methods for calculating square and cube roots come from India, and that he is the first to extend these methods to the determination of roots of any order (Rashed and Vahabzadeh 2000, 6). Even more interestingly, Khayyam states that he has demonstrated the validity of his methods using proofs that \u201care only numerical demonstrations based on the arithmetical Books of the Elements\u201d (Rashed and Vahabzadeh 2000, 116\u2013117). If both of these statements are true, then it is hard to avoid the conclusion that Khayyam had used the binomial theorem\n\\[(a + b)^n = a^n + na^{n-1}b + \\cdots + nab^{n-1}+ b^n\\]\n\nin his method, improving on and extending Ab\u016b Bakr al-Karaj\u012b\u2019s (ca. 953\u20131029) work on binomial expansions. \u201cPascal\u2019s\u201d celebrated arithmetic triangle is a triangular arrangement of the binomial expansion terms\u2019 coefficients. Scholars such as Ch\u0101vosh\u012b advocate renaming Pascal\u2019s triangle as \u201cal-Kharaj\u012b-Khayyam\u2019s\u201d triangle, given how European mathematicians adopted the same method of extracting roots as Khayyam\u2019s (Ch\u0101vosh\u012b 1380 A.H.s., 262\u2013273).\nThe history of Pascal\u2019s triangle appears to originate in India with Acharya Pingala\u2019s (ca. 200 BCE) study of meter and sound combinations in Sanskrit poetry. The Indian commentator Halayudha wrote a commentary on Pingala\u2019s Chandahsutra at the end of the 10th century CE giving the first appearance of a triangular arrangement of the binomial coefficients, solely as a means of finding the number of combinations of short and long syllable patterns. Meanwhile in China, Jia Xian (ca. 1050) had also discovered the method of finding \\(n\\)-th roots with Pascal\u2019s triangle, as relayed by the 13th century mathematician Yang Hui. However, Jia Xian\u2019s work is not extant. Thus, we rely on two lost manuscripts, over approximately the same time period, to determine the Islamic and Chinese origins of Pascal\u2019s triangle as a means for finding \\(n\\)-th roots (Joseph 2011, 247, 270\u2013281, 354\u2013355).\n",
