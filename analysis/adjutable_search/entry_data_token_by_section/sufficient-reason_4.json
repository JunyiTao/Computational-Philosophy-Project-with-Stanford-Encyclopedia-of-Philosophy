    "main_text": "Leibniz || Why Did Leibniz Believe the PSR?\n3.2 Why Did Leibniz Believe the PSR?\n\nLeibniz argues for the PSR in three distinct ways: (1) from the\nconcept of a sufficient reason and the concept of a\n\u201crequisite\u201d; (2) from his theory of truth; and (3)\ninductively.\n\nIn some texts, Leibniz argues that the PSR is a conceptual truth that\nis derivable from the concepts of a sufficient reason and the concept\nof a requisite (A VI, ii, 483; see also G VII 393, LC L5.18; A\nVI.iii.133). The concept of a requisite is that of a necessary\ncondition. In this context, Leibniz defines a sufficient reason as a\nsufficient condition. If something exists, then all of its requisites\nhave been posited. Leibniz then asserts that if all of a things\nrequisites have been posited, then it exists. Thus, all of a\nthing\u2019s requisites are a thing\u2019s sufficient reason. The\nquestion-begging assumption is that all the necessary conditions for\nsomething to exist are jointly sufficient for it to exist. Anybody who\ndenies the PSR will not agree with this assumption and it is clearly\nnot encoded in the definitions of requisite and\nsufficient reason provided by Leibniz (for further\ndiscussion, see Harrop 2020).\n\nIn other texts, Leibniz argues that the PSR follows from the\nconceptual containment theory of truth (A VI.iv.1645/L 268; AG 31).\nEvery truth is such that the concept of the predicate is contained the\nconcept of the subject. This conceptual connection is the sufficient\nreason for the truth. Thus every truth has a sufficient reason.\n\nIt is worth noting that Leibniz believed the PSR before he developed\nhis conceptual containment Theory of Truth. In fact, the PSR is one of\nLeibniz\u2019s earliest and most stable philosophical commitments\n(see, for example, Leibniz\u2019s 1671 letter to Wedderkopf A\nII.ii.117f/L146). This observation has led some scholars to conclude\nthat rather than deriving the PSR from the conceptual containment\ntheory of truth, Leibniz was in fact led to the conceptual containment\ntheory from his antecedent commitment to the PSR. The conceptual\ncontainment theory explains how there could be a sufficient reason for\nevery truth by guaranteeing that there will be an explanation in terms\nof conceptual relations (see Adams 1994: 69). Moreover, in at least\none text, it is not at all clear whether, for Leibniz, the conceptual\ncontainment theory of truth motivates the PSR, or rather it is the PSR\nwhich motivates the conceptual containment theory of truth: see\nLeibniz, Philosophical Writings, 172).\n\nIn his Fifth paper to Clarke, Leibniz argues for the PSR inductively.\nHe says that there are many cases where a fact has a sufficient reason\nand no cases where fact is known not to have a sufficient reason. He\nthen says that it is reasonable to assume that the PSR holds in all\ncases where we do not know that sufficient reason. Leibniz describes\nthis as \u201cthe method of experimental philosophy, which proceeds\na posteriori\u201d (G VII 420; LC, L5.129).\n",
