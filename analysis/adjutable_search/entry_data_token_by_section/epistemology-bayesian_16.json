    "main_text": "Synchronic Norms (I): Requirements of Coherence || Chance-Credence Principles\n3.5 Chance-Credence Principles\n\nRecall the Coin Case discussed above: one\u2019s credence in\n\u201cthe coin will land heads the next time it is tossed\u201d\nconditional on \u201cthe coin is fair\u201d is equal to 0.5. This\n0.5 conditional credence seems to be the only permissible alternative\nuntil the result of the next coin toss is observed. This example\nsuggests a general norm, which connects chances to conditional\ncredences:\n\n\n\n\nThe Principal Principle/Direct Inference\nPrinciple. Let \\(\\Cr\\) be one\u2019s prior, i.e., the credence\nassignment that one has at the beginning of an inquiry. Let \\(E\\) be\nthe event that such and such things will happen at a certain future\ntime. Let \\(A\\) be a proposition that entails \\(\\Ch(E) = c\\), which\nsays that the chance for \\(E\\) to come out true is equal to \\(c\\).\nThen one\u2019s prior \\(\\Cr\\) ought to be such that \\(\\Cr(E \\mid A) =\nc\\), if \\(A\\) is an \u201cordinary\u201d proposition in that it is\nlogically equivalent to the conjunction of \\(\\Ch(E) = c\\) with an\n\u201cadmissible\u201d proposition.\n\n\n\nThe if-clause refers to \u201cadmissible\u201d propositions, which\nare roughly propositions that give no more information about whether\nor not \\(E\\) is true than is already contained in \\(\\Ch(E) = c\\). To\nsee why we need the qualification imposed by the if-clause, suppose\nfor instance that the event \\(E\\) is \u201cthe coin will land heads\nthe next time it is tossed\u201d. If the conditioning proposition\n\\(A\\) is \u201cthe coin is fair\u201d, it is a paradigmatic example\nof an \u201cordinary\u201d proposition. This reproduces the Coin\nCase, with the conditional credence being the chance 0.5.\nAlternatively, if the conditioning proposition \\(A\\) is the\nconjunction of \u201cthe coin is fair\u201d and \\(E\\), then the\nconditional credence \\(\\Cr(E \\mid A)\\) should be 1 rather than the 0.5\nchance of \\(E\\) that \\(A\\) entails. After all, to be given this \\(A\\)\nis to be given a lot of information, which entails \\(E\\). So this case\nis supposed to be ruled out by an account of \u201cadmissible\u201d\npropositions. Lewis (1980) initiates a systematic quest for such an\naccount, which has invited counterexamples and responses. See Joyce\n(2011: sec. 4.2) for a survey.\n\nThe Principal Principle has been defended with an argument based on\nconsiderations about the accuracies of credences (Pettigrew 2012), and\nwith a nonstandard Dutch Book argument (Pettigrew 2020a: sec.\n2.8).\n\nThe Principal Principle is important perhaps mainly because of its\nextensive applications in Bayesian statistics, in which this principle\nis more often called the Direct Inference Principle. To illustrate,\nsuppose that you are somehow certain that one of the following two\nhypotheses is true: \\(H_1 =\\) \u201cthe coin has a bias 0.4\u201d\nand \\(H_2 =\\) \u201cthe coin has a bias 0.6\u201d, which are\nparadigmatic examples of \u201cordinary\u201d hypotheses. Then your\ncredence in the first hypothesis \\(H_1\\) given evidence \\(E\\) that the\ncoin lands heads ought to be expressible as\n follows:[6]\n \n\\[\\begin{align}\n        \\Cr(H_1 \\mid E)\n        &= \\frac{ \\Cr(E \\mid H_1) \\cdot \\Cr(H_1) }{ \\sum_{i =1}^2 \\Cr(E \\mid H_i) \\cdot \\Cr(H_i) } &{\\text{by Bayes' Theorem}\\\\ \\text{(as stated in \u00a72)}}\n        \\\\\n        &= \\frac{ 0.4 \\cdot \\Cr(H_1) }{ 0.4 \\cdot \\Cr(H_1) + 0.6 \\cdot \\Cr(H_2) } &{\\text{by the Principal}\\\\ \\text{Principle}}\n    \\end{align}\\]\n\n\nSo Bayes\u2019 Theorem works by expressing posterior credences in\nterms of some prior credences \\(\\Cr(H_i)\\) and some prior conditional\ncredences \\(\\Cr(E \\mid H_i)\\). The latter, called\nlikelihoods, are subjective opinions, but they can\nbe replaced by objective chances thanks to the Principal\nPrinciple. So this principle is often taken to be an important way to\nreduce some subjective factors in the Bayesian account of scientific\ninference. For discussions of other subjective factors, see\n section 4.1.\n\nEven though the Principal Principle has important, extensive\napplications in Bayesian statistics as just explained, de Finetti\n(1970 [1974]) argues that it is actually dispensable and thus need not\nbe accepted as a norm. To be more specific, he argues that the\nPrincipal Principle is dispensable in a way that changes little of the\nactual practice of Bayesian statistics. His argument relies on his\nexchangeability theorem. See Gillies (2000: 69\u201382) for\na non-technical introduction to this topic; also see Joyce (2011: sec.\n4.1) for a more advanced survey.\n\n",
