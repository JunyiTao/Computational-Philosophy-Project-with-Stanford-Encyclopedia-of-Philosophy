    "main_text": "Knowledge and Deeds: the Purpose of Human Being\n3. Knowledge and Deeds: the Purpose of Human Being\n\n\nLike any engaged Neoplatonist, Ibn Gabirol is first and foremost\ninterested in understanding the nature and purpose of human being: we\nmust understand what we are (our nature) so that we know how to live\n(our purpose). This set of interconnected human questions is what Ibn\nGabirol is interested in even in the midst of what might sometimes seem\nto be rather laborious cosmological and metaphysical explorations. Ibn\nGabirol, like other Neoplatonists, explores layers of cosmological and\nmetaphysical realities in an attempt to understand how to live the best\nhuman life possible.\n\n\nEmphasizing that this is Ibn Gabirol's main concern, we find\nin the opening pages of his Fons Vitae text a reminder that\nthe goal of the entire inquiry is to understand why human beings were\nmade (\u201cQuare factus est homo?,\u201d \u201cWhy was man\nmade?\u201d\u2014Fons Vitae 1.1, p. 2, line 8)\u2014which \nis to say, to understand the ends (or purpose) of human being\n(the Fons Vitae teaches that a human ought to \u201cpursue\nknowledge of his final cause [or: purpose] according to which he was\ncomposed,\u201d Fons Vitae 1.2, p. 4, lines 8\u20139). In spelling\nout the true, divinely ordained goal of human life (the purpose of the\nhuman life is described as a product of God's Will\nat Fons Vitae 1.2, p. 4, lines 10\u201312), the text describes a\ntwofold endeavor: the pursuit of knowledge and the doing of good deeds\n(Fons Vitae 1.2, p. 4, line 27).\n\n\nWhile the remaining hundreds of pages of the Fons Vitae go\non to offer highly obscure elaborations on matter and form, the overall\npoint of the entire study (and one might argue, of Ibn Gabirol's\nentire oeuvre of poetry as well) is not obscure at all: his\ngoal is to understand the nature of being and human being so that he\nmight better understand and better inspire the pursuit of knowledge and\nthe doing of good deeds:\n\n\nKnowledge indeed leads to deeds, and deeds separate the soul from\nthe contraries which harm it\u2026In every way, knowledge and deeds\nliberate the soul from the captivity of nature and purge it of its\ndarkness and obscurity, and in this way the soul returns to its higher\nworld. (Fons Vitae 1.2, p. 5, line 27\u2013p. 6, line 4)\n\n\n\u201cAnd in this way, the soul returns to its higher world.\u201d\nThe ends of humanity (reached through the pursuit of truth and\ngoodness) are imagined by Ibn Gabirol\u2014as we find is the case\namong Neoplatonists more generally\u2014through the evocative image\nof a \u201creturn\u201d coupled with the image of a \u201chigher\nworld\u201d:\n\nStudent: What is the purpose of man?\n\nTeacher: The inclination [applicatio] of his soul to the\nhigher world in order that everyone might return to his like.\n\n(Fons Vitae 1.2, p. 4, lines 23\u201325)\n\n\n\nThe joint imagery of a \u201creturn\u201d and a \u201chigher\nworld\u201d are themselves part of a conceptual framework in which all\nof existence is seen to follow a principle of similitude whereby lesser\nbeings mirror higher beings. This idea, often expressed as the idea\nthat \u201cthe microcosm mirrors the macrocosm\u201d\u2014a common\nPlatonic, Pythagorean, and Neoplatonic trope\u2014has a strongly\nprescriptive overtone: it's not simply that lesser things mirror\ngreater things, but that in this mirroring, we find the purpose of the\nlesser things, viz. to be just like the greater things. Depending on\nthe context, the \u201clesser things\u201d and \u201cgreater\nthings\u201d might vary, but the most popular version of this\n\u201cmicrocosm mirrors the macrocosm\u201d idea, and the one at play\nin the above Ibn Gabirol passage, envisions the human being (sometimes\nhuman soul, sometimes human intellect) as the \u201clesser\nthing\u201d and the wisely ordered cosmos (and sometimes, relatedly,\nthe mind of God or, alternatively, the cosmic Intellect) as the\n\u201cgreater thing.\u201d In this descriptive idea that humans\nmirror something greater there emerges the strongly prescriptive\nreminder that we ought to emulate that which is better than ourselves\n(viz. through the pursuit of knowledge and good deeds). This\nprescriptive call to human perfection through truth and goodness is the\nessence of the idea of Neoplatonic Return, and it is this idea which\nlies at the core of Ibn Gabirol's claim that we ought purge our\nsouls of darkness and \u201creturn to our like[ness]\u201d.\n\n\nIn one especially important Fons Vitae passage, we find a\ndescription of this Neoplatonic return which very much reflects\nPlotinus' own famous ascent passage (at Enneads 4.8.1),\na passage reproduced (with important changes) in what misleadingly\nbecame known as the Theology of Aristotle, an Arabic\ncompilation-edition of books 4\u20136 of Plotinus'\n Enneads.[17]\nHere is the final part of Ibn Gabirol's version:\n\n\n\u2026But if you should lift yourself to the first universal\nmatter and [are] illumined by its shadow, you will then see the most\nwondrous of wonders. Devote yourself to this and be filled with love\nfor it, since here lies the meaning for which the human soul exists,\nand here lies too amazing delight and utmost happiness (Fons\nVitae 3.56; my translation from the Arabic and Latin; for Wedeck\ntranslation, see his Fountain of Life (Ibn Gabirol 1962/2008),\npp. 110\u2013111)\n\n\nIn addition to many other changes from Plotinus and the Theology\nof Aristotle, one special point of difference is the reference\nhere to universal matter (see section 5). It is precisely Ibn\nGabirol's unique focus on \u201cuniversal matter\u201d (a grade\nof spiritual materiality at the very core of existence) which leads him\nto uniquely envision the ultimate moment of Neoplatonic return as a\nmoment of \u201cilluminated shadow\u201d: since there is a material\nelement just \u201cabove\u201d Intellect for Ibn Gabirol, the return\nto Intellect will be characterized by the light of Wisdom set within\nthe shade of the supernal first matter.\n\n\nIn the closing sentences of the Fons Vitae, Ibn Gabirol\nfurther describes this state of \u201creturn\u201d as a liberation\nfrom death and a cleaving to the source of life (\u201cEvasio\nmortis et applicatio ad originem vitae,\u201d Fons Vitae\n5.43, p. 338, line 21). Following on general Neoplatonic intuitions,\nthis means that when one has attained the heights of truth and\ngoodness, one will have reverted to one's truest life, a pure\nstate of soul which transcends mortal life\u2014we might describe it\nas a kind of immortality while in the mortal body. This directly\nresonates with what A.H. Armstrong, in his study of Plotinus, has\ndescribed as the Neoplatonic doctrine of \u201cDouble Selfhood,\u201d\na sensitivity to the human condition being at one and the same time (1)\nalready fully imbued with the fullest state of intellect, but somewhat\nparadoxically also (2) fallen from\u2014and needing to return to\u2014the \nfullest state of intellect.\n\n\nWhile Ibn Gabirol's quest towards the Neoplatonic Return\ncenters, as we have seen, on the pursuit of truth and goodness, it also\nincludes an attempt to know the unknowable God. In laying out the kinds\nof truth that the human soul must aim to acquire, the Fons\nVitae speaks of \u201cthe knowledge of all things according to\nwhat they are\u201d (Fons Vitae 1.4, p. 6, lines 13\u201314), and\nmost of all of the knowledge of the First Essence [Latin, essentia\nprima, Arabic, adh-dh\u00e2t\nal-\u2019\u00fbl\u00e2, as evidenced in some\nof the extant Arabic fragments of the Fons Vitae; see Pines\n1958/77 and Fenton 1976] that sustains and moves all things. While we\nare asked to know God\u2014understood by Ibn Gabirol in tripart\nterms as a hidden First Essence and as an active, manifesting Will and\nWisdom\u2014we are cautioned a few lines later that it is impossible\nto truly know the First Essence, and that we can only aspire to know\nthe things which He makes and sustains (Fons Vitae 1.4, p. 6,\nlines 19\u201322). As it relates to Ibn Gabirol's more general\ncharacterization of God in the Fons Vitae in tripart terms as\nan essential hidden reality and an active manifesting Will and Wisdom,\nwe might say that for Ibn Gabirol, we can only know God through the\nmanifestation of his Will and Wisdom in the ordered structure of\nexistents in the universe (i.e. through the things which He makes and\nsustains, and in particular, through the wisdom revealed by them).\n",
