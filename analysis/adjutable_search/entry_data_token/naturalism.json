Its current usage derives from debates in\nAmerica in the first half of the last century. The self-proclaimed\n\u201cnaturalists\u201d from that period included John Dewey, Ernest\nNagel, Sidney Hook and Roy Wood Sellars. These philosophers aimed to\nally philosophy more closely with science. They urged that reality is\nexhausted by nature, containing nothing \u201csupernatural\u201d,\nand that the scientific method should be used to investigate all areas\nof reality, including the \u201chuman spirit\u201d (Krikorian 1944,\nKim 2003).\nSo understood, \u201cnaturalism\u201d is not a particularly\ninformative term as applied to contemporary philosophers. The great\nmajority of contemporary philosophers would happily accept naturalism\nas just characterized\u2014that is, they would both reject\n\u201csupernatural\u201d entities, and allow that science is a\npossible route (if not necessarily the only one) to important truths\nabout the \u201chuman spirit\u201d.\nEven so, this entry will not aim to pin down any more informative\ndefinition of \u201cnaturalism\u201d. It would be fruitless to try\nto adjudicate some official way of understanding the term. Different\ncontemporary philosophers interpret \u201cnaturalism\u201d\ndifferently. This disagreement about usage is no accident. For better\nor worse, \u201cnaturalism\u201d is widely viewed as a positive\nterm in philosophical circles\u2014only a minority of philosophers nowadays\nare happy to announce themselves as\n\u201cnon-naturalists\u201d.[1]\n This inevitably leads to a divergence in\nunderstanding the requirements of \u201cnaturalism\u201d. Those\nphilosophers with relatively weak naturalist commitments are inclined\nto understand \u201cnaturalism\u201d in a unrestrictive way, in\norder not to disqualify themselves as \u201cnaturalists\u201d,\nwhile those who uphold stronger naturalist doctrines are happy to set\nthe bar for \u201cnaturalism\u201d\nhigher.[2]\nRather than getting bogged down in an essentially definitional\nissue, this entry will adopt a different strategy. It will outline a\nrange of philosophical commitments of a generally naturalist stamp,\nand comment on their philosophical cogency. The primary focus will be\non whether these commitments should be upheld, rather than on whether\nthey are definitive of \u201cnaturalism\u201d. The important thing\nis to articulate and assess the reasoning that has led philosophers in\na generally naturalist direction, not to stipulate how far you need to\ntravel along this path before you can count yourself as a paid-up\n\u201cnaturalist\u201d.\nAs indicated by the above characterization of the\nmid-twentieth-century American movement, naturalism can be separated\ninto an ontological and a methodological component. The ontological\ncomponent is concerned with the contents of reality, asserting that\nreality has no place for \u201csupernatural\u201d or other\n\u201cspooky\u201d kinds of entity. By contrast, the methodological\ncomponent is concerned with ways of investigating reality, and\nclaims some kind of general authority for the scientific method.\nCorrespondingly, this entry will have two main sections, the first\ndevoted to ontological naturalism, the second to methodological\nnaturalism.\nOf course, naturalist commitments of both ontological and\nmethodological kinds can be significant in areas other than\nphilosophy.  The modern history of psychology, biology, social science\nand even physics itself can usefully be seen as hinging on changing\nattitudes to naturalist ontological principles and naturalist\nmethodological precepts. This entry, however, will be concerned solely\nwith naturalist doctrines that are specific to philosophy. So the\nfirst part of this entry, on ontological naturalism, will be concerned\nspecifically with views about the general contents of reality that are\nmotivated by philosophical argument and analysis. And the second part,\non methodological naturalism, will focus specifically on\nmethodological debates that bear on philosophical practice, and in\nparticular on the relationship between philosophy and science.\n", "toc": [{"#OntNat": "1.

Ontological Naturalism\n1.1 Making a Causal Difference\nA central thought in ontological naturalism is that all\nspatiotemporal entities must be identical to or metaphysically\nconstituted by \nphysical[3] \nentities. Many ontological naturalists thus\nadopt a physicalist attitude to mental, biological, social and other such\n\u201cspecial\u201d subject matters. They hold that there is\nnothing more to the mental, biological and social realms than\narrangements of physical entities.\nThe driving motivation for this kind of ontological naturalism is\nthe need to explain how special entities can have physical effects.\nThus many contemporary thinkers adopt a physicalist view of the mental\nrealm because they think that otherwise we will be unable to explain\nhow mental events can causally influence our bodies and other\nphysical items. Similar considerations motivate ontologically\nnaturalist views of the biological realm, the social realm, and so\non.\nIt may not be immediately obvious why this need to account for\nphysical effects should impose any substantial naturalist constraints\non some category. After all, there seems nothing a priori\nincoherent in the idea of radically unscientific\n\u201csupernatural\u201d events exerting a causal influence on\nphysical processes, as is testified by the conceptual cogency of\ntraditional stories about the worldly interventions of immaterial\ndeities and other outlandish beings.\nHowever, there may be a posteriori objections to such\nnon-natural causal influences on the physical world, even if there are\nno a priori objections. We shall see below how modern\nscientific theory places strong restrictions on the kinds of entities\nthat can have physical effects. Given that mental, biological and\nsocial phenomena do have such effects, it follows that they must\nsatisfy the relevant restrictions.\nNote how this kind of argument bites directly only on those\ncategories that do have physical effects. It places no immediate\nconstraints on categories that lack any such effects, which arguably\ninclude the mathematical and modal realms, and perhaps the moral\nrealm.  We shall return to the question of whether there are any\nfurther reasons for ontologically naturalist views about such putatively\nnon-efficacious categories in sections 1.7\nand 1.8 below.\n1.2 Modern Science and Causal Influence\nThere is an interesting history to modern science\u2019s views\nabout the kinds of things that can produce physical effects (Papineau 2001). It will\nbe worth rehearsing this history in outline, if only to forestall a\ncommon reaction to ontological naturalism. It is sometimes suggested\nthat ontological naturalism rests, not on principled grounds, but on\nsome kind of unargued commitment, some ultimate decision to nail\none\u2019s philosophical colours to the naturalist\nmast.[4] And\nthis diagnosis seems to be supported by the historical contingency of\nontologically naturalist doctrines, and in particular by the fact that they have\nbecome widely popular only in the past few decades. However,\nfamiliarity with the relevant scientific history casts the matter in a\ndifferent light. It turns out that naturalist doctrines, far from\nvarying with ephemeral fashion, are closely responsive to received\nscientific opinion about the range of causes that can have physical\neffects.\nA short version of this history runs like this: (1) the mechanistic\nphysics of the seventeenth century allowed only a very narrow range of\nsuch causes; (2) early Newtonian physics was more liberal, and indeed\ndid not impose any real restrictions on possible causes of physical\neffects; (3) however, the discovery of the conservation of energy in\nthe middle of the nineteenth century limited the range of possible\ncauses once more; (4) moreover, twentieth-century physiological\nresearch has arguably provided evidence for yet further\nrestrictions.\nLet us now rehearse this story more slowly.\n(1) The \u201cmechanical philosophers\u201d of the early\nseventeenth century held that any material body maintains a constant\nvelocity unless acted on, and moreover held that all action is due to\nimpact between one material particle and another. So stated, the\nmechanical philosophy immediately precludes anything except impacting\nmaterial particles from producing physical effects. Leibniz saw this\nclearly, and concluded that it discredited Descartes\u2019\ninteractive dualism, which had a non-material mind influencing the\nphysical world (Woolhouse 1985). (Of course, Leibniz did not therewith\nreject dualism and embrace the physicalist view that minds are\ncomposed of material particles, but instead opted for\n\u201cpre-established harmony\u201d.  Views which avoid ontological\nnaturalistic views of the mind by denying that mental events have any physical\neffects will be discussed further in\nsection 1.6 below.)\n(2) At the end of the seventeenth century Newtonian physics\nreplaced the mechanical philosophy of Descartes and Leibniz. This\nreinstated the possibility of interactive dualism, since it allowed that\ndisembodied forces, as well as impacts, could cause physical\neffects. Newtonian physics was open-ended about the kinds of forces\nthat exist. Early Newtonians posited fundamental mental and vital\nforces alongside magnetic, chemical, cohesive, gravitational and\nimpact forces. Accordingly, they took sui generis mental\naction in the material world to be perfectly consistent with the\nprinciple of physics. Moreover, there is nothing in the original\nprinciples of Newtonian mechanics to stop mental forces arising\nautonomously and spontaneously, in line with common assumptions about\nthe operation of the mind (Papineau 2001: Section 7).\n(3) In the middle of the nineteenth century the conservation of\nkinetic plus potential energy came to be accepted as a basic principle\nof physics (Elkana 1974). In itself this does not rule out fundamental\nmental or vital forces, for there is no reason why such forces should\nnot be \u201cconservative\u201d, operating in such a way as to\ncompensate losses of kinetic energy by gains in potential energy\nand vice versa. (The term \u201cnervous energy\u201d is a\nrelic of the widespread late nineteenth-century assumption that mental\nprocesses store up a species of potential energy that is then released\nas kinetic energy in action.) However, the conservation of energy does imply that any\nsuch special forces must be governed by strict deterministic laws: if\nmental or vital forces arose spontaneously, then there would be\nnothing to ensure that they never led to energy increases.\n(4) During the course of the twentieth century received\nscientific opinion became even more restrictive about possible\ncauses of physical effects, and ruled out any sui generis\nmental or vital causes, even of a law-governed and predictable\nkind. Detailed physiological research, especially into the operation of nerve cells,\ngave no indication of any physical effects that cannot be explained\nin terms of basic physical forces that also occur outside living\nbodies. By the middle of the twentieth century, belief in sui\ngeneris mental or vital forces had become a minority view. This\nled to the widespread acceptance of the doctrine now known as the\n\u201ccausal closure\u201d or the \u201ccausal completeness of\nthe physical\u201d, according to which all physical effects have\nfully physical causes.\n1.3 The Rise of Physicalism\nThis historical sequence casts light on the evolution of\nontologically naturalist doctrines. In the initial seventeenth-century\nmechanical phase, there was a tension, as Leibniz observed, between\nthe dominant strict mechanism and interactive dualism. However, once\nmechanism was replaced by a more liberal understanding of forces in the second Newtonian phase, science ceased to raise any objections to\ndualism and more generally to non-physical causes of physical effects.\nAs a result, the default philosophical view was a non-naturalist\ninteractive pluralism which recognized a wide range of fundamental\nnon-physical influences, including spontaneous mental influences (or\n\u201cdeterminations of the soul\u201d as they would then have been\ncalled).\nIn the third phase, the nineteenth-century discovery of the\nconservation of energy continued to allow that sui generis\nnon-physical forces can interact with the physical world, but\nrequired that they be governed by strict force laws. Sui\ngeneris mental and vital forces were still widely accepted, but\nan extensive philosophical debate about the significance of the\nconservation of energy led to a widespread recognition that any such\nforces would need to be law-governed and thus amenable to scientific\ninvestigation. We might usefully view this as a species of\nontological naturalism that falls short of full physicalism.  Mental\nand other special forces were still sui generis and non-physical, but even so they fell within the realm of\nscientific law and so could not operate spontaneously. (As many commentators\nat the time recognized, this weaker form of naturalism already\ncarried significant philosophical implications, particularly for the\npossibility of free \nwill.[5]) \nIn the final twentieth-century phase, the acceptance of the causal\nclosure of the physical led to full-fledged physicalism. The causal\nclosure thesis implied that, if mental and other special causes are to\nproduce physical effects, they must themselves be physically\nconstituted. It thus gave rise to the strong physicalist doctrine that\nanything that has physical effects must itself be physical.\nIn support of this understanding of the twentieth-century history, it is\nnoteworthy how philosophical arguments in favour of physicalism began to appear from the 1950s onwards. Some of these arguments appealed\nexplicitly to the causal closure of the physical realm (Feigl 1958,\nOppenheim and Putnam 1958). In other cases, the reliance on causal\nclosure lay below the surface. However, it is not hard to see that\neven in these latter cases the causal closure thesis played a crucial\nrole.\nThus, for example, consider J.J.C. Smart\u2019s (1959) thought\nthat we should identify mental states with brain states, for otherwise\nthose mental states would be \u201cnomological danglers\u201d which\nplay no role in the explanation of behaviour. Or take David\nLewis\u2019s (1966) and David Armstrong\u2019s (1968) arguments\nthat, since mental states are picked out by their causal roles, and\nsince we know that physical states play these roles, mental states\nmust be identical with those physical states. Finally, consider Donald\nDavidson\u2019s (1970) argument that, since the only laws governing\nbehaviour are those connecting behaviour with physical antecedents,\nmental events can only be causes of behaviour if they are identical\nwith those physical antecedents. At first sight, it might not be\nobvious that these arguments require the causal closure thesis. But a\nmoment\u2019s thought will show that none of these arguments would\nremain cogent if the closure thesis were not assumed, and it were thus\nleft open that some physical effects (the movement of matter in arms,\nperhaps, or the firings of the motor neurones which instigate those\nmovements) were not determined by prior physical causes at all, but\nby sui generis mental causes.\nQuantum mechanics is often taken to involve a departure from\ndeterminism.  Sometimes it is suggested that indeterminism of this\nsort creates room for sui generis non-physical causes to\ninfluence the physical world. However, even if quantum mechanics\nimplies that some physical effects are themselves undetermined, it\nprovides no reason to doubt a quantum version of the causal closure\nthesis, to the effect that the chances of those effects are\nfully fixed by prior physical circumstances. And this alone is enough\nto rule out sui generis non-physical causes. For such sui\ngeneris causes, if they are to be genuinely efficacious, must\npresumably make an independent difference to the chances of physical\neffects, and this in itself would be inconsistent with the quantum\ncausal closure claim that such chances are already fixed by prior\nphysical circumstances. Once more, it seems that anything that makes a\ndifference to the physical realm must itself be physical.\n1.4 Reductive and Non-Reductive Physicalism\nIt will be worth being explicit about the way the causal closure\nprinciple supports physicalism. First we assume that mental causes\n(biological, social, \u2026) have physical effects. Then the causal\nclosure principle tells us that those physical effects have physical\ncauses. So, in order to avoid an unacceptable proliferation of causes\nfor those physical effects (no \u201csystematic\noverdetermination\u201d), we need to conclude that the mental\n(biological, social, \u2026) causes of those effects are not\nontologically separate from their physical causes.\nHowever, even if this general line of argument is accepted, there\nis room for differing views about exactly what its denial of\nontological separateness requires. Let us agree that causes are\n\u201cevents\u201d (or \u201cfacts\u201d) that involve\ninstantiations of \nproperties.[6]\n So, if some special cause is not\nontologically separate from some physical cause, the property\ninstantiations that it involves cannot themselves be ontologically\nseparate from the property instantiations involved in the physical\ncause. At this point, however, there are divergent views about how\ntight a constraint this imposes.\nOne school holds that it requires type-identity, the strict\nidentity of the relevant special properties with physical\nproperties. On the other side stand \u201cnon-reductive\u201d\nphysicalists, who hold that the causal efficacy of special causes will\nbe respected as long as the properties they involve are\n\u201crealized by\u201d physical properties, even if they are not\nreductively identified with them.\nType-identity is the most obvious way to ensure the\nnon-separateness of special and physical causes: if exactly the same\nproperties comprise the special and physical cause, the two causes\nwill themselves be fully identical. Still, type-identity is a very\nstrong doctrine. Type identity about thoughts, for example, would\nimply that the property of thinking about the square root of two is\nidentical with some physical property. And this seems highly\nimplausible. Even if all human beings with this thought must be\ndistinguished by some common physical property of their\nbrains\u2014which itself seems unlikely\u2014there remains the\nargument that other life-forms, or intelligent androids, will also be\nable to think about the square root of two, even though their brains\nmay share no significant physical properties with ours (Fodor 1974,\nBickle 2013).\nThis \u201cvariable realization\u201d argument has led many\nphilosophers to seek an alternative way of reconciling the efficacy of\nmental and other special causes with the causal closure thesis, one\nwhich does not require the strict identity of non-physical and\nphysical properties. The general idea of this \u201cnon-reductive\nphysicalism\u201d is to allow that instantiations of a given special\nproperty will always be grounded in or metaphysically determined by\ninstantiations of physical properties, but to add that these\n\u201crealizing\u201d physical properties might be different in\ndifferent cases. So, for example, any being who thinks about the\nsquare root of two will do so in virtue of instantiating some physical\nproperties, but these can be different physical properties in\ndifferent cases\u2014in one human being it may be one set of neural\narrangements, in another a different set, and in other life forms it\nmight involve nothing like neural properties at all.\nThere are various more detailed ways of filling out this idea of\nnon-reductive physicalism. A common feature is the requirement that\nspecial properties should metaphysically supervene on physical\nproperties, in the sense that any two beings who share the realizing\nphysical properties will necessarily share the same special\nproperties, even though the physical properties which so realize the\nspecial ones can be different in different beings. This arguably\nensures that nothing more is required for any specific instantiation\nof a special property than its physical realization\u2014even God\ncould not have created your brain states without thereby creating your\nfeelings\u2014yet avoids any reductive identification of special\nproperties with physical ones. (This is a rough sketch of the\nsupervenience formulation of physicalism. For more see Stoljar\n2015.)\nSome philosophers object that non-reductive physicalism does not in\nfact satisfy the original motivation for physicalism, on the grounds\nthat it does not really reconcile the efficacy of mental and other\nspecial causes with the causal closure thesis (Kim 1998, Robb and Heil\n2014: Section 6). According to non-reductive physicalism, special\nproperties are not type-identical with any strictly physical\nproperties, even though they supervene on them. And this then seems to\nimply that any given special cause will be distinct from the\nphysical cause that realizes it, since it involves the\ninstantiation of a different property. (The property of thinking about\nthe square root of two is definitely a different property from the\nneural property that realizes it in me, say, since another being could\nshare the former property without sharing the latter.)\nThe opponents of non-reductive physicalism then insist that this\ngives us an unacceptable proliferation of causes for the physical\neffects of special causes after all\u2014both the physical cause\nimplied by the causal closure thesis and the distinct special\ncause. In response, advocates of non-reductive physicalism respond\nthat there is nothing wrong with such an apparent duplication of\ncauses if it is also specified that the latter metaphysically\nsupervene on the former.\nThe issue here hinges on the acceptability of different kinds of\nsystematic overdetermination (Bennett 2003). All can agree that it\nwould be absurd if the physical effects of special causes always had\ntwo metaphysically independent causes. Plugging this into the causal\nclosure argument for physicalism, we can conclude that there can be\nno metaphysically independent non-physical causes (such as Cartesian\ndualist mental causes) for effects that already have full physical\ncauses. However, even if \u201cstrong overdetermination\u201d by\ntwo ontologically independent causes is so ruled out, this does not\nnecessarily preclude \u201cweak overdetermination\u201d by both a\nphysical cause and a metaphysically supervenient special cause.\nAdvocates of non-reductive physicalism argue that this kind of\noverdetermination is benign and consistent with the causal\nargument\u2019s denial of strong overdetermination, since now the\ntwo causes are not metaphysically distinct\u2014the special cause\nisn\u2019t genuinely additional to the physical cause (nothing more\nis needed for your feelings than your brain states).\n1.5 Physicalist Downwards Causation\nSome recent writers have explored a different way of upholding the\ncausal efficacy of non-reduced mental and other special causes. Where\nthe \u201cbenign overdetermination\u201d option says certain effects\nhave a special cause as well as a physical cause, these\nwriters urge that some effects have a special cause instead\nof a physical cause.\nSuppose a pigeon pecks at crimson tiles. Is the pecking caused by\nthe specific shade, crimson, or the more generic colour, red? The\nnatural answer is that it depends. If the pigeon pecks only at crimson\ntiles, and not at other shades of red, then it is the crimsonness that\nis causing the pecking; but if the pigeon pecks at any shade of\nred, it is the redness. Examples like these have led a number of\nwriters to require that causes be proportional to their\neffects (Yablo 1992; Menzies 2008; List and Menzies 2009, 2010).  We\nshould attribute the effect to that property that is specific enough\nto suffice for it, but no more specific than that.\nThis suggests that sometimes special causes and not their\nphysical realizers might be responsible for physical effects. Suppose\nI want to hail a taxi, and that this desire is realized by some brain\nstate, and that I then wave my arm. It seems that it will then be the\ndesire that is proportional to the waving, not the brain state, in\nthat I would still have waved my arm if my desire had been differently\nrealized, though not if I hadn\u2019t had the desire at all.\nSome will say that in such cases the desire\ncausally explains the waving, but that it is still the brain\nstate that causes it. This thought appeals to the intuition\nthat real causal relations are always constituted by basic physical\ninteractions, by bits of matter bumping into each other. But this\nintuition is not decisive, and a number of theoretical considerations\nspeak against it.  For instance, the \u201cdifference-making\u201d\naccount of causation developed by James Woodward implies that generic\nproperties often eclipse their more specific realizations as\ncauses (Woodward 2005), as does the view that causation is a\nrelatively macroscopic phenomenon whose temporal asymmetry is\nanalogous to the temporal asymmetries of thermodynamics (Loewer 2007,\nPapineau 2013).\nIt is worth observing that physicalists who advocate this kind of\ndownwards special causation are in some danger of sawing off the\nbranch they are sitting on, in that they now seem to be advocating\ncounter-examples to the causal closure of the physical. If my\narm\u2019s waving is caused by my desire and not by my brain state,\nit would seem to have a mental cause and not a physical cause, and thus run counter to\nthe closure thesis that every physical effect has some fully physical\ncause. Since the original rationale for embracing physicalism was\nsupposed to be science\u2019s discovery that the physical realm is\ncausally closed, this may seem to leave physicalists in an awkward\nposition.\nHowever, even if the examples of \u201cdownwards\u201d causation\ndo undermine the thesis of the causal closure of the physical, it\nmay still be possible to rework the original argument for\nphysicalism in terms of closure under nomological determination,\nrather than causal\n closure.[7]\n Nothing in the idea of proportional\ncausation threatens the idea that modern physics shows that all\nphysical effects (or their chances) are fully nomologically\ndetermined by physical antecedents, even if they aren\u2019t always caused by them. And this in itself argues that metaphysically independent special causes would imply an unacceptable strong overdetermination of physical events.\n1.6 Conscious Properties and Closure Arguments\nSome philosophers take there to be compelling arguments against the\nview that conscious states are metaphysically constituted by\nphysical states. This rejection of physicalism about conscious properties certainly\nhas the backing of intuition. (Don\u2019t zombies\u2014beings who\nare physically exactly like humans but have no conscious\nlife\u2014intuitively seem metaphysically possible?) However,\nwhether this intuition can be parlayed into a sound argument is a\nhighly controversial issue, and one that lies beyond the scope of\nthis entry.  A majority of contemporary philosophers probably hold\nthat physicalism can resist these\narguments.[8]\nBut a significant minority take the other side.\nThis minority has a number of options. One is to hold that conscious properties are \"epiphenomenal\" and do not exert any influence on brain processes or subsequent behaviour (Jackson 1982, 1986; Chalmers\n1996).[9] Another is to embrace the \"overdeterminationist\" view that the physical results of conscious causes are always strongly overdetermined , both by their normal physical antecedents and by the metaphysically independent conscious causes (Mellor 1995, Kroedel 2015). Still, neither of these positions is attractive. They require us to posit odd causal structures, either involving a species of effects that are never themselves causes, or a species of effects that are always strongly overdetermined. Given that nature displays no other examples of such causal structures, general principles of theory choice would seem to argue against both epiphenomenalism and overdeterminationism.\nIn consequence, a yet further option has become increasingly popular among those who are persuaded that consciousness must transcend the physical realm. This is the Russellian monist option that locates conscious properties among the basic categorical properties that play the dispositional roles described by physical science. This option has the virtues of separating consciousness from the world described by physics without positing any special causal structures operating in the brain (Alter and Pereboom 2019).\nIt is an interesting question whether Russellian monism is necessarily opposed to physicalism rather than a special case of it (Montero 2015, Brown 2017). In any case, we should note that Russellian monism is designed to conform to the causal (or determinational) closure of the physical realm, as indeed are epiphenomenalism and overdeterminationism. It is striking that nearly all contemporary views of the mind-brain relations are naturalist at least to the extent that they respect this closure thesis. Strongly interactionist views that allow the conscious mind to make an independent difference to the physical world have few defenders nowadays (but see Lowe 2000, 2003; Steward 2015).\n1.7 Moral Facts\nG.E. Moore\u2019s well-known \u201copen question\u201d argument\nis designed to show that moral facts cannot possibly be identical to\nnatural facts. Suppose that the natural properties of some situation\nare completely specified. It will always remain an open question,\nargued Moore, whether that situation is morally good or bad (Moore\n1903).\nMoore took this argument to show that moral facts constitute a\ndistinct species of non-natural fact. However, any such non-naturalist\nview of morality faces immediate difficulties, deriving ultimately\nfrom the kind of causal closure thesis discussed above. If all\nphysical effects are due to a limited range of physically-grounded\nnatural causes, and if moral facts lie outside this range, then it\nfollow that moral facts can never make any difference to what happens\nin the physical world (Harman 1986). At first sight this may seem\ntolerable (perhaps moral facts indeed don\u2019t have any physical\neffects). But it has awkward epistemological consequences. For beings\nlike us, knowledge of the spatiotemporal world is mediated by physical\nprocesses involving our sense organs and cognitive systems. If moral\nfacts cannot influence the physical world, then it is hard to see how\nwe can have any knowledge of them.\nThe traditional non-naturalist answer to this problem is to posit a\nnon-natural faculty of \u201cmoral intuition\u201d that gives us\nsome kind of direct access to the moral realm (as explained in Ridge\n2014: Section 3). However, causal closure once more makes it\ndifficult to make good sense of this suggestion. Presumably at some\npoint the posited intuitive faculty will need to make a causal\ndifference in the physical world (by affecting what people say and\ndo, for example). And at this point the causal closure argument will\nbite once more, to show that a non-natural intuitive faculty would implausibly imply that some of our actions are strongly overdetermined by two metaphysically independent antecedents.\nMoral non-naturalism has had something of a revival in recent years, with defenders including Russ Shaffer-Landau (2003), Ralph Wedgwood (2007), Derek Parfit (2011) and David Enoch (2011). Still, the challenge of accounting for our access to non-natural moral facts remains, and it is debatable whether any of these writers has found a satisfactory alternative to a causally problematic faculty of intuition. Perhaps the most developed suggestion is Enoch\u2019s (2011) appeal to the indispensability of non-natural moral facts to moral reasoning, a line of argument that is analogous to Hilary Putnam\u2019s case for non-natural mathematical objects, to be discussed in the next section below. But Enoch\u2019s appeal arguably faces many of the same general objections as Putnam\u2019s argument, as well as objections specific to the moral realm (see Leng 2016).\nIn light of the difficulties facing moral non-naturalism, most\ncontemporary moral philosophers opt instead for some species of\nnaturalist view. We can divide the naturalist options here into two\nbroad categories: irrealist and realist. Irrealist moral naturalists\naim to account for moral discourse by offering naturalist accounts of\nthe social and linguistic and practices that govern it, but without\nsupposing that moral utterances report on moral facts with a\nsubstantial independent existence (Joyce 2015). By contrast,\nnaturalist moral realists agree with moral non-naturalists that\nsubstantial moral facts exist, but seek to locate them in the natural\nrealm rather than in some sui generis non-natural realm\n(Lenman 2014).\nBoth these broad categories have further sub-divisions. Among the\nirrealists, we can distinguish explicitly non-cognitivist views like\nemotivism and prescriptivism which deny that moral judgements express\nbeliefs (Hare 1952, Blackburn 1993, Gibbard 2003) from cognitivist\nviews that accept that moral judgements do express beliefs but deny a\nsubstantial reality to the putative facts to which they answer; and\namong the latter cognitivist views we can distinguish error-theoretic\nfictionalist options which view moral judgements as simply false\n(Mackie 1977, Kalderon 2005) from projectivist options which hold that\nmoral discourse is sufficiently disciplined for its judgements to\nqualify for a species of truth even though they do not report on\nindependently existing causally significant facts (Wright 1992, Price\n2011). \nNaturalist moral realism also comes in different varieties. In\nrecent debates two versions have figured prominently; \u201cCornell\nrealism\u201d, which includes moral facts among the causally\nsignificant facts but resists their type-reducibility to non-moral\nfacts (Sturgeon 1985, Boyd 1988), and \u201cmoral\nfunctionalism\u201d which is happy to equate moral facts with\nstraightforwardly descriptive facts (Jackson 1998). \nAny kind of moral naturalist realist needs to reject Moore\u2019s\nopen question argument. There are two alternatives here. One is to\ninsist that Moore\u2019s posited openness is relatively superficial,\nand that there is no principled barrier to inferring moral facts a\npriori from the non-moral natural facts, even if such inferences\nwill sometimes require a significant amount of information and reflection. The\nother is to argue that the constitution of moral facts by non-moral\nnatural facts is an a posteriori matter, akin to the relation\nbetween water and H2O, and that therefore Moore\u2019s\nopenness only points to a conceptual gap, not a metaphysical one\n(Ridge 2014: Section 2).\nThis sub-section has focused on morality. But there are other\ntopics which arguably involve matters of value, such as aesthetics, the normativity of theoretical and practical reason, and so on. The constraints placed\non theories of moral facts by naturalist considerations will\napply, mutatis mutandis, in these areas too, militating\nagainst theories that posit non-natural value-bearing facts and in\nfavour of naturalist alternatives, of either a realist or irrealist\nstripe.\n1.8 Mathematical Facts\nMathematics raises many of the same issues for ontological\nnaturalism as morality. Mathematical claims typically involve a\ncommitment to abstract objects like numbers and sets, eternal entities\noutside space and time. This might seem cogent at first sight, but\nonce more epistemological difficulties quickly arise. Abstract objects\ncan have no effects in the spatiotemporal world. How then can\nspatiotemporal being like ourselves come to know about them?\nHowever the mathematical case does not fully parallel the moral\none.  One of the options in the moral case was naturalist realism,\nwhich reads moral claims as about natural facts which play causal\nroles in the spatiotemporal world. However, given the explicit\ncommitment of mathematical claims to abstract objects without\nspatiotemporal location, this option does not seem available in the\nmathematical case (but see Maddy 1990). So we seem required to choose\nbetween non-naturalist realism about non-spatiotemporal mathematical\nentities or naturalist irrealism.\nAs in the moral case, non-naturalist realism faces epistemological\nchallenges, to which one response is to posit a\nfaculty of intuition which gives us access to the abstract\nmathematical realm.  Kurt G\u00f6del arguably favoured a view along\nthese lines (Parsons 1995). However, once more this only seems to push\nthe problem back.  There seems no good way for the posited faculty to\nbridge the causal gap between the abstract and the spatiotemporal\nrealms without generating implausible overdetermination.\nAn alternative version of non-naturalist realism aims to vindicate\nmathematical and modal claims as essential parts of our best overall\ntheories of the world. According to this line of thought, defended by\nHilary Putnam, our empirically best-supported scientific theories\ncommit us to mathematical entities; ergo, we are entitled to believe\nin such entities (Putnam \n1971).[10]\nHowever, it is contentious whether our best-supported empirical\ntheories do commit us to abstract mathematical entities. The most\nprominent version of naturalist irrealism about mathematics, Hartry\nField\u2019s fictionalism, disputes precisely this claim. According\nto Field, we can construct \u201cnominalist\u201d\nversions of scientific theories that avoid commitment to abstract\nmathematical objects yet are explanatorily\nsuperior to the \u201cplatonist\u201d alternatives. Field argues\nthat we do not have to regard mathematics itself as literally true in\norder to understand its use in science and other applications. Rather\nit can be viewed as a \u201cuseful fiction\u201d which facilitates\ninferences between nominalistic scientific claims, but is not itself\nimplicated in our most serious beliefs about the world (Field 1980,\n1989).\nNot all philosophers of mathematics are convinced that Fieldian\nnominalizations are available to replace all scientific references to\nabstract mathematical objects. In particular, some have argued that\ncertain explanations of nominalist facts make essential reference to\nabstract objects (Baker 2005, Batterman 2010). In response, others\nhave sought to show that there are in fact good nominalist\nexplanations of the facts in question (Daly and Langford 2009,\nButterfield 2011, Menon and Callender 2013). In any case, it is not\nclear that Field\u2019s metaphysical stance requires a full execution\nof his nominalizing programme, as opposed to a case for its cogency:\ndifficulties in constructing nominalist theories can always be\nattributed to limitations of human ingenuity rather than the reality\nof abstract mathematical objects (Leng 2013).\nPerhaps the most popular contemporary alternative to fictionalism\nis the version of non-naturalist realism offered by the neo-Fregean\nthesis that abstract mathematical beliefs can be justified as analytic\ntruths that follow from logic and certain meaning stipulations. The\nidea has been most fully developed in connection with arithmetic,\nwhere Crispin Wright has shown how Peano\u2019s postulates can be\nderived within the framework of second-order logic from nothing except\nthe Humean principle that the same number attaches to equinumerous\nconcepts.  According to Wright, this principle can be viewed as an\nimplicit definition of our concept of number. If this is right, then\nit has indeed been shown that arithmetic, and therewith the existence\nof numbers as abstract objects, follows from logic and definition\nalone (Wright 1983, Hale and Wright 2003). There has also been some\nattempt to extend the programme to mathematical analysis (Shapiro\n2000, Wright 2000).\nOne query that might be put to this programme is whether the Humean\nprinciple and analogous assumptions can really be viewed as analytic\ndefinitions. If they commit us to numbers and other abstract objects\nwhose existence cannot established without them, then they are\narguably doing more than definitions should. A related issue is\nwhether the overall neo-Fregean position is properly viewed as\nrealist. From its perspective, the role of abstract mathematical\nobjects in the overall scheme of things seems to be exhausted by their\nmaking our mathematical statements true; given this, it might seem\nbetter to classify it as a species of irrealism (MacBride 2003).\nTo complete this discussion of ontological naturalism, let us\nbriefly consider the realm of modality, understood as the subject\nmatter of claims that answer to something more than\nactuality. Modality raises many of the same issues as mathematics, but\nthe topic is complicated by the prior question of the content of modal\nclaims, and in particular about whether they quantify over non-actual\npossible worlds. Whereas there is little dispute about the initial\nsemantic analysis of mathematical claims\u2014they purport to refer\nto abstract numbers, sets, functions and so on\u2014there is somewhat\nless unanimity about the possible worlds analysis of modal claims\n(Nolan 2011b).\nTo the extent that modal claims do quantify over possible worlds,\nthe ontological points made about mathematics apply well here too.\nSince non-actual worlds do not inhabit our spatiotemporal realm, an\nontologically naturalist realism seems to be ruled out from the\nstart.  The remaining alternatives are irrealism or non-naturalist\nrealism. The former alternative has been explored in recent years by\nmodal fictionalists (Rosen 1990; Nolan 2011a). The options under\nthe latter heading meet the same epistemological challenges as in\nthe mathematical case: brute intuition faces causal problems; it is\ncontentious whether we should take our best scientific theories to\ncommit us to possible worlds; and, if modal knowledge is to be\nanalytically a priori, on the model of mathematical\nneo-Fregeanism, then it is not obvious that it can take us to\nknowledge of possible worlds construed realistically.  \n2. Methodological Naturalism\n2.1 Philosophy and Science\nIn what follows, \u201cmethodological naturalism\u201d will be\nunderstood as a view about philosophical practice. Methodological\nnaturalists see philosophy and science as engaged in essentially the\nsame enterprise, pursuing similar ends and using similar methods.\nAmong philosophers of religion, \u201cmethodological\nnaturalism\u201d is sometimes understood differently, as a thesis about natural\nscientific method itself, not about philosophical method. In this\nsense, \u201cmethodological naturalism\u201d is the view that religious\ncommitments have no relevance within science: natural science itself\nrequires no specific attitude to religion, and can be practised just\nas well by adherents of religious faiths as by atheists or agnostics\n(Draper 2005). This thesis is of interest to philosophers of religion\nbecause many of them want to deny that methodological naturalism in\nthis sense entails \u201cphilosophical naturalism\u201d, understood\nas atheism or agnosticism. You can practice natural science in just\nthe same way as non-believers, so this line of thought goes, yet\nremain a believer when it comes to religious questions. Not all defenders of religious belief endorse this kind of\n\u201cmethodological naturalism\u201d, however. Some think that religious\ndoctrines do make a difference to scientific practice, yet are\ndefensible for all that (Plantinga 1996). In any case, this kind of\n\u201cmethodological naturalism\u201d will not be discussed further\nhere. Our focus will be on the relation between philosophy and\nscience, not between religion and science.\nWhat exactly is involved in adopting a methodologically naturalist attitude to the relation between philosophy and science? In order to focus what follows, let us understand methodological naturalism as the specific claim that philosophy and science are both concerned to establish\nsynthetic knowledge about the natural world, and moreover to achieve\nthis by a posteriori investigation.\nMethodological naturalists will of course allow that\nthere are some differences between philosophy and science. But they\nwill say that these are relatively superficial, a matter of focusing on different\nquestions rather than any radical difference of approach. For one thing, philosophical questions are often\ndistinguished by their great generality. Where scientists think about\nviruses, electrons or stars, philosophers think about spatiotemporal\ncontinuants, properties, causation or time, categories that\nstructure all our thinking about the natural world. Another common feature of philosophical questions is that they involve some kind of\ntheoretical tangle. Our thinking supports different lines of thought that lead\nto conflicting conclusions. Progress requires an unravelling of\npremises, including perhaps an unearthing of implicit assumptions\nthat we didn\u2019t realize we had.\nFor both these reasons, philosophical issues are rarely resolved by new observational data. The normal philosophical predicament is that we have all the observational data we could want, but aren\u2019t sure of the best way of accommodating them. Still, methodological naturalists will urge, this doesn\u2019t mean that a posteriori synthetic theories are not the aim of philosophy. A theory produced by unravelling the theoretical tangles surrounding some general category can still be an a posteriori synthetic theory, even if no new observational findings went into its construction.\nFrom the methodological naturalist perspective, then, philosophical views are synthetic claims that answer to the overall tribunal of a posteriori observational evidence. The obvious objection to this view, however, is that it does not accord with philosophical practice. In particular, it seems in tension with the central role that intuitions play in philosophy. The typical way to assess philosophical views is arguably to test them against intuitive judgements about possible cases, not against a posteriori observational data. So, for example, the description theory of names is challenged by our intuitions about Kripke\u2019s imagined counterexamples, the tripartite theory of knowledge by our intuitive reactions to Gettier cases, and so on. At first pass, this certainly suggests that philosophy is centrally concerned with the analysis of everyday concepts, not the construction of synthetic theories: it is using intuitions about possible cases to uncover the structure implicit in our concepts. The reliance on intuitions thus argues that, far from delivering synthetic a posteriori knowledge, philosophy uses a priori methods to deliver analytic conclusions.\nMethodological naturalists can respond to this challenge at a number of points. For one thing, they can ask whether intuitions really do play a central role in philosophy. For another, they can query whether, even if they do, they are really a priori intuitions. And finally, they can dispute whether, even if the intuitions are a priori, they are genuinely analytic. It will be convenient to consider these different responses in reverse order.\n2.2 The Canberra Plan\nOne influential strand in contemporary philosophy is quite explicit in claiming that analytic intuitions play a central role in philosophy. Inspired by David Lewis, and led by Frank Jackson and David Chalmers, this is widely known as the \u201cCanberra Plan\u201d. On this conception, philosophy starts with an initial analysis\nof concepts employed by everyday thought, such as free will,\nsay, or knowledge, or moral value, or conscious\nexperience. Once this stage has been completed, philosophy\ncan then turn to \u201cserious metaphysics\u201d to demonstrate how\na limited number of ingredients (for example, physical ingredients)\nmight satisfy these everyday concepts. This second stage is likely to\nappeal to synthetic a posteriori scientific knowledge about\nthe fundamental nature of reality. But the purely analytic first\nstage, according to the Canberra plan, also plays an essential part in setting the\nagenda for the subsequent metaphysical investigation.(Jackson 1998, Braddon-Mitchell and Nola 2009, Chalmers 2012.)\nAn initial question about this programme relates to its scope. It\nis by no means clear that all, or indeed any, philosophically\ninteresting concepts can be subject to the relevant kind of\nanalysis. Jackson himself assumes that pretty much all everyday\nconcepts can be analysed as equivalent to \u201cthe kind which\nsatisfies such-and-such folk\nassumptions\u201d.[11] \nBut it is arguable that many everyday\nconcepts are not so constituted, but rather have their semantic\ncontents fixed by observational, causal or historical relations to\ntheir referents.\nStill, we can let this point pass. Even if we suppose, for the sake\nof the argument, that a range of philosophically interesting everyday\nconcepts do have their contents fixed in the way the Canberra\nprogramme supposes, there are further objections to its understanding\nof philosophical method.\nLet us look a bit more closely at the posited initial\nagenda-setting stage of the Canberra programme. Upon closer\nexamination, it is not clear that this makes any essential appeal to\nanalytic knowledge.  Defenders of the Canberra plan\ncharacteristically explain their strategy in terms of \u201cRamsey\nsentences\u201d (e.g., Jackson 1998: 140). Suppose \\(T(F)\\) is the\nset of relevant everyday assumptions involving some philosophically\ninteresting concept. For example, F may be the concept\nbelief, and the assumptions in T may include\n\u201ccharacteristically caused by perceptions\u201d,\n\u201ccombines with desires to generate actions\u201d, and\n\u201chas causally significant internal structure\u201d. Then the\nRamsey sentence corresponding to \\(T(F)\\) is \u201c\\(\\exists!\\Phi\n(T(\\Phi))\\)\u201d.[12] \nFor the concept belief, this would say: there is some unique kind that is characteristically caused by perceptions, combines with desires to generate actions, and has causally significant internal structure.\n The Canberra suggestion is then that, once we\nhave articulated the relevant Ramsey sentence, we will be in a\nposition to turn to serious metaphysics to identify the underlying\nnature of the F that plays the relevant role.\nHowever, if this is the Canberra procedure, then there is no reason\nto think of it as appealing to analytic knowledge at any stage. A\nRamsey sentence of the kind at issue says that there actually exists\nsome entity satisfying certain requirements (there is a kind of state\nthat is caused by perceptions \u2026). Sentences like this make\neminently synthetic and falsifiable claims. It is not a matter of\ndefinition that humans actually have internal states that play the\ncausal role associated with the concept of belief. The Canberra\nstrategy thus seems no different from the prescription that philosophy\nshould start with the synthetic theories endorsed by everyday thought,\nand then look to our more fundamental theories of reality to see what,\nif anything, makes these everyday theories true. This seems entirely\nin accord with methodological naturalism\u2014philosophy is in the\nbusiness of assessing and developing synthetic theories of the\nworld.\nThe crucial point here is that Ramsey sentences don\u2019t define\nconcepts like belief, but eliminate them. They give us a way of saying\nwhat our everyday theories say without using the relevant concept\n(there is a kind of state that is caused by perceptions \u2026) If\nwe want definitions, then we need \u201cCarnap sentences\u201d, not\nRamsey sentences (Lewis 1970). The Carnap sentence corresponding to\n\u201c\\(\\exists!\\Phi(T(\\Phi))\\)\u201d is \u201cIf\n\\(\\exists!\\Phi(T(\\Phi)\\), then \\(T(F)\\)\u201d.  (If there is\na kind of state that is caused by perceptions \u2026, then\nit\u2019s belief.) Carnap sentences can plausibly be viewed as akin\nto stipulations that fix the reference of the relevant concepts, and\nto that extent as analytic claims that can be known a\npriori. But this certainly does not mean that Ramsey sentences,\nwhich make substantial claims about the actual world, are also\nknowable via a priori analysis. (Note how you can accept a\nconditional Carnap sentence even if you reject the corresponding\nunconditional Ramsey sentence. You can grasp the folk concept of\nbelief even if you reject the substantial folk theory of belief.)\nCan\u2019t defenders of the Canberra programme argue that it is\nthe analytic Carnap sentences that are crucial in setting\nphilosophical agendas, not the synthetic Ramsey sentences? But this\nseems wrong. We will want to know about the fundamental nature of\nbelief if we suppose that there is a kind of state that is\ncharacteristically caused by perceptions, and so on. That is certainly\na good motivation for figuring out whether and how the fundamental\ncomponents of reality might constitute this state. But the mere fact\nthat everyday thought contains a concept of such a state in itself\nprovides no motivation for further investigation. (In effect, the\nfunction of a Carnap sentence is to provide a shorthand for talking\nabout the putative state posited by the corresponding Ramsey\nsentence. It is hard to see how any important philosophical issues\ncould hang on the availability of such a shorthand.)\nTo emphasize the point, consider the everyday concept of a soul,\nunderstood as something that is present in conscious beings and survives\ndeath. This concept of a soul can be captured by the analytic Carnap\nsentence: \u201cIf certain entities inhabit conscious beings and\nsurvive death, then they are souls\u201d. Accordingly, this Carnap\nsentence will be agreed by everybody who has the concept of soul,\nwhether or not they believe in souls. Yet this Carnap sentence will\nnot per se raise any interesting metaphysical questions for\nthose who deny the existence of souls. These deniers won\u2019t start\nwondering how the fundamental constituents of reality realize\nsouls\u2014after all, they don\u2019t believe in souls. It is only\nthose who accept the corresponding Ramsey sentence (\u201cThere are\nparts of conscious beings that survive death\u201d) who will see a\nmetaphysical issue here. Moreover, the Ramsey sentence will pose this\nmetaphysical issue whether or not it is accompanied by some analytic\nCarnap sentence to provide some shorthand alternative terminology. In\nshort, the methodological naturalist can insist that anybody\ninterested in \u201cserious metaphysics\u201d should start by\narticulating the substantial existential commitments of our folk\ntheories, as articulated in their synthetic Ramsey sentences. Any\nfurther analytic conceptual commitments add nothing of philosophical\nsignificance.\nThe point generalizes beyond the contrast between Ramsey and Carnap\nsentences. On reflection, it is hard to see why any purely\ndefinitional analytic truths should matter to philosophy. Synthetic\neveryday truisms can certainly be philosophically significant, and so\ntheir articulation and evaluation can play an important philosophical\nrole. But there is no obvious motive for philosophy to concern itself\nwith definitions that carry no implications about the contents of\nreality. \n2.3 Synthetic A Priori Intuitions?\nIt is worth noting that not all philosophers who advertise themselves as engaging in \u201cconceptual\nanalysis\u201d are committed to the idea that this involves analytic a priori knowledge. In many cases philosophers who describe themselves in this way go on to explain that in their view \u201cconceptual\nanalysis\u201d is a matter of articulating synthetic claims and assessing them against a posteriori evidence. A particularly clear version of this picture of conceptual analysis is offered by Robert Brandom (2001). Similarly, recent advocates of \u201cconceptual engineering\u201d are explicit that in their view \u201cconcepts\u201d embody substantial commitments which are open to criticism on a posteriori grounds (Cappelen 2018, Cappelen, Plunket and Burgess 2019). In the end, it is not clear what differentiates \u201cconceptual analysis\u201d in this sense from the a posteriori assessment of theories. In any case, this species of conceptual analysis seems perfectly consistent with methodological naturalism. (See also Goldman 2007.)\nOther philosophers are also explicit that \u201cconceptual\nanalysis\u201d issues in synthetic claims, but simultaneously regard\nit as a source of a priori knowledge (e.g. Jenkins 2008,\n2012). This combination of views is less straightforward. In\nparticular, it seems open to the traditional query: how is such\nsynthetic a priori knowledge possible? If some claim is not\nguaranteed by the structure of our concepts, but answers to the nature\nof the world, then how is it possible to know it without a\nposteriori evidence?\nYet other philosophers distance themselves from talk of conceptual\nanalysis, but even so feel that philosophical reflection is a source\nof synthetic a priori intuition (Sosa 1998, 2007). They too\nwould seem to face the traditional query of how synthetic a\npriori knowledge is possible.\nIn this context, Timothy Williamson has recently argued that the\ntraditional distinction between a priori and a\nposteriori knowledge is less than clear-cut, and in particular\nthat it breaks down in connection with the intuitions on which\nphilosophers rely. In Williamson\u2019s view, there is a distinctive\nphilosophical method in which intuitive judgements play a central\nrole, but there is no warrant for classifying the relevant intuitions\nas a priori rather than a posteriori (Williamson\n2013).\nHowever, it is arguable that this does not so much address as\nby-pass the underlying question. Perhaps philosophical intuitions are\nnot best classified as clearly \u201ca priori\u201d. But,\nif philosophy\u2019s distinctive methodology relies on synthetic\nintuitions, this still seems to call for some explanation of their reliability.\nDoubts about the reliability of philosophical intuitions have been\namplified over the past few years by the findings of\n\u201cexperimental philosophy\u201d. Empirical studies have\nindicated that many central philosophical intuitions are by no means\nuniversal, but rather peculiar to certain cultures, social classes and\ngenders (Knobe and Nichols 2008, 2017). This variability of intuitions is in\nobvious tension with their reliability. If different people have\nopposed philosophical intuitions, then it cannot be that intuitions of\nthis kind are always true.\nTimothy Williamson has responded to this challenge from\nexperimental philosophy by suggesting that, while the intuitions of\nordinary people on philosophical matters might be unreliable, those of\nphilosophers in particular can be trusted. In his view, a proper\nphilosophical training winnows out mistaken philosophical reactions\n(2007: 191; 2011).  However, this position still seems to call for a\npositive explanation of how synthetic philosophical knowledge might be\nestablished without a posteriori evidence, even if it is\nrestricted to trained philosophers.\nThe possibility of such an explanation is not of course to be\ndismissed out of hand. There is no contradiction in\nthe idea of experience-independent access to synthetic truths. After\nall, until the eighteenth century no modern philosopher doubted that\nGod had bestowed on us powers of reason that would enable us to\narrive at perception-independent knowledge of a range of synthetic\nclaims. Even if few contemporary philosophers would still appeal to\nGod in this context, there are other possible mechanisms that could\nplay an equivalent role.[13] It is not to be ruled out that our\nbiological heritage, for example, has fixed a range of beliefs in us\nwhose reliability owes nothing to our individual ontogenetic\nexperience.  Indeed there is a case for viewing certain aspects of\nour cultural heritage as playing a similar role, imbuing us with\ncertain beliefs whose justification rests on ancestral rather than\nindividual experience.[14]\nHowever, it is one thing to point to the general possibility of\nbiological and cultural mechanisms constituting\nexperience-independent sources of reliable knowledge, another to\nshow that such mechanisms operate within philosophy. Even if there\nare areas of thought which rest on such foundations, this does not\nshow that the intuitions of philosophers in particular have a\nsimilar backing. Moreover, there is arguably direct reason to doubt\nthat they do. It is not just the intuitions of everyday people on\nphilosophical matters that have a poor track record. The same applies\nto philosophers through history. It is not hard to think of\ndeep-seated intuitions appealed to by past philosophers that have\nsince been discredited. (A purely mechanical being cannot reason;\nspace must be Euclidean; an effect cannot be greater than its cause;\nevery event is determined; temporal succession cannot be relative.)\nIn the next section we will see that there is reason to suppose that\nthis unreliability is intrinsic to the nature of philosophy.\n2.4 A Role for Intuitions\nThe challenge to philosophical intuitions is clear enough. Either\nthey are analytic, in which they contain no substantial information,\nor they are synthetic, in which case they are of dubious\nreliability.[15] \n Given this, a number of philosopher of\nnaturalist inclinations advocate a revisionary attitude to\nphilosophical method. Philosophy should turn away from intuitions, and\ninstead engage directly with proper observational evidence. (Kornblith\n2002, Knobe and Nichols 2008.)\nHowever, this is not the only possible reaction. We would do well to remember that intuitions arguably plays a role in science as well as philosophy. The history of science displays a number of important thought experiments, like Galileo\u2019s analysis of free fall, or the Einstein\u2019s argument against the completeness of quantum mechanics. And intuition functions here very much as it does in philosophy. The scientist imagines some possible situation, and then makes an intuitive judgement about what would happen.\nIn such cases, it is clearly not mere analytic definitions that are at issue. An eminently synthetic claim\u2014say, that heavier bodies fall faster\u2014is undermined by a contrary intuition\u2014if a big and small body are tied together, they will be heavier than the big one, but will not fall faster. This thought is clearly not guaranteed by concepts alone, but by synthetic assumptions about the way the world works.\nStill, this kind of example still faces the second horn of the dilemma about intuitions. If the intuitions involve substantial synthetic claims, why should we take them to be reliable? The historical track record of intuitions is scarcely any better in science than in philosophy. In both realms it would seem wiser to avoid unreliable intuitions and engage directly with observational evidence.\nHowever, there is a way of understanding the role of intuitions in both science and philosophy that evades this worry. Instead of viewing them as designed to elicit authoritative judgments to which philosophical theories must defer, they can instead be seen as devices\nwhich help us to articulate our implicit assumptions when we are\nthreatened with paradox and have difficulty finding a solution.\nRecall a point made at the beginning of our discussion of\nmethodological naturalism. Philosophical problems are typically\noccasioned by some kind of theoretical tangle. Different but equally\nplausible lines of though lead us to conflicting conclusions.\nUnraveling this tangle requires that we lay out different theoretical\ncommitments and see what might be rejected or modified. A useful\nheuristic for this purpose may well be to use intuitions about\nimaginary cases to uncover the implicit synthetic assumptions that are\nshaping our thinking. This can help us better to appreciate our\noverall theoretical alternatives, and assess which gives the best\noverall fit with the a posteriori evidence.\nThis perspective on philosophical thought experiments shows why we\nshould positively expect many of the intuitions they elicit to prove\nwanting. Perhaps there are contexts outside philosophy where various\nkinds of a priori intuitions can be relied upon. But if\nphilosophical problems typically arise because we are unsure about\nwhat exactly is amiss in the overall set of synthetic claims we bring\nto the world, then it would seem only to be expected that the fault\nwill often lie in the implicit intuitions driving our judgements about cases.\nIt is worth noting that this often happens with scientific thought\nexperiments too. Galileo\u2019s intuition that light bodies fall as\nfast as heavy ones was vindicated by subsequent physics. But the\nverdict can also go the other way. For example, the assumption behind\nthe Einstein\u2019s argument against the completeness of quantum\nmechanics is nowadays rejected. But this certainly did not mean that\nhis thought experiment was worthless. On the contrary, it led J. S.\nBell to the derivation of the eponymous inequality whose experimental\nconfirmation ruled out local hidden variable theories.\nIt is not hard to think of similar philosophical cases. The worth\nof philosophical thought-experiments does not always require that the\nintuitions they elicit are sound. Consider the classic Lockean set-up\nwhere someone\u2019s memories are transferred to a new body. We all\nhave an intuition that the person goes with the memories, not the old\nbody, as evidenced by our reactions to the many fictions which trade\non just this kind of scenario. But few philosophers of personal\nidentity would nowadays hold that this intuition is decisive in favour\nof Lockeanism. Again, consider the intuition that conscious properties\nare ontologically distinct from physical ones, as displayed in our\nimmediate reaction to zombie scenarios. Here too, few would suppose\nthat these intuitions by themselves decide the case. Still, even those\nwho reject Lockeanism and dualism will allow that reflection on\nmemory-switching and zombie cases has played a crucial role in\nclarifying what is at issue in the debates. The evocation of\nintuitions by philosophical thought experiments is important, not\nbecause they provide some special kind of a priori evidence,\nbut simply because they need to be made explicit and assessed against\nthe overall a posteriori evidence.[16]\nThis perspective on thought experiments shows that there is a sense\nin which recent developments within \u201cexperimental\nphilosophy\u201d can be viewed as complementing traditional armchair\nmethods. In the previous section we saw that some of the findings of\nexperimental philosophy carry the implication that everyday intuitions\nare not generally reliable. But in addition to this\n\u201cnegative\u201d message, there is also room for experimental\nphilosophy to make a positive philosophical contribution, even in\ncases where there is no variation in intuitions.\nCareful experimental probing can helpfully augment traditional\narmchair methods as a way of identifying the structure of implicit\nassumptions that drive intuitive judgments about test cases.\nSometimes thought experiments may be enough. But in more complicated\ncases systematic questionnaires and surveys may well be a better way\nof identifying the implicit cognitive structures behind our\nphilosophical reactions.\nNote that experimental philosophy, even when viewed in this\npositive light, is at most an addition to our philosophical armoury,\nnot a new way of doing philosophy. For once we have sorted out the\nintuitive principles behind our philosophical judgements, whether by\narmchair reflection or empirical surveys, we still need to assess\ntheir worth.  Even if the claim that we think a certain way is\nsupported by hard empirical data, this doesn\u2019t make that way\nof thinking correct.  That can only be shown by subjecting that way\nof thinking itself to proper a posteriori evaluation.\n2.5 Mathematical, Modal and Moral Knowledge\nMethodological naturalism fits more naturally with some areas of\nphilosophy than others. It is perhaps not hard to understand, at least\nin outline, how work in areas like metaphysics, philosophy of mind,\nmeta-ethics and epistemology might be aimed at the construction of\nsynthetic theories supported by a posteriori evidence. But in\nother philosophical areas the methodologically naturalistic project\nmay seem less obviously applicable. In particular it might be unclear\nhow it applies to those areas of philosophy that make claims about\nmathematics, first-order morality or modality.\nOne possibility would be for methodological naturalists to make\nexceptions for these areas of philosophy. It would still be a\nsignificant thesis if methodological naturalism could be shown to\napply to a number of central areas of philosophy, even if some specialist\nareas call for a different methodology.\nThis final subsection will address two issues raised by this suggestion. The first relates specifically to the idea that modal claims constitute a specialism within philosophy. Perhaps mathematical investigation and even first-order moralizing can be regarded as specialist subfields within philosophy. But it is arguable that a concern with the modal realm runs through all of philosophy. If so, then a challenge to the naturalist status of modal claims will threaten the naturalist status of all philosophy.\nThe second issue will be more directly about the methodologically naturalist status of the three areas mentioned\u2014including mathematics and morality, along with modality. How far do methodological naturalists need to allow that mathematics, morality and modality constitute exceptions to their position in the first place?\n\nOn the first issue, Bertrand Russell said\n [A philosophical proposition] must not deal\nspecially with things on the surface of the earth, or with the solar\nsystem, or with any other portion of space and time. \u2026 A\nphilosophical proposition must be applicable to everything that exists\nor may exist. (1917: 110)\n However, one can agree with Russell that\nphilosophy automatically has implications for the modal realm\n(\u201ceverything that \u2026 may exist\u201d), without accepting\nthat the aim of philosophy is to explore the modal realm as such. We\nneed to distinguish here between an interest in claims which, as it\nhappens, have modal implications, on the one hand, and an interest in\nthose modal implications themselves, on the other.  It is\nuncontentious that most of the claims of interest to philosopher have\nmodal implications. But it does not follow from this that most of\nphilosophy is interested in the modal realm itself.\nPhilosophy is largely concerned with claims about identity and\nconstitution, claims which as it happens will be necessary if they are\ntrue. When philosophers ask about knowledge, names, persons,\npersisting objects, free will, causation, and so on, they are seeking\nto understand the identity or constitution of these kinds. They want\nto know whether knowledge is the same as true justified belief,\nwhether persisting objects are composed of temporal parts, and so\non. And so any truths they might establish about such matters will\ninevitably be necessary rather than contingent, and so carry\nimplications about a realm beyond the actual.\nBut the fact that p implies necessarily p does\nnot mean that anyone who is interested in the former must be\ninterested in the latter, any more than someone who is interested in\nJohn\u2019s age being 47 must be interested in its being a prime\nnumber.\nThis makes room for methodological naturalists to insist that most\nprimary philosophical concerns are synthetic and a\nposteriori, even if they imply additional modal claims which are\nnot. Natural science provides a good analogy here. Water is\nH2O. Heat is molecular motion. Stars are made of hot\ngas. Halley\u2019s comet is made of rock and ice. Since all these\nclaims concern matters of identity and constitution, they too are\nnecessary if true. But science is interested in these synthetic a\nposteriori claims as such, rather than their modal\nimplications. Chemistry is interested in the composition of actual\nwater, and not with what happens in other possible\nworlds. Methodological naturalists can take the same line with\nphilosophical claims. Their focus is on whether knowledge is actually\nthe same as true justified belief, or whether persisting objects are\nactually composed of temporal parts\u2014issues which they take to be\nsynthetic and a posteriori\u2014and not with whether these\ntruths are necessary\u2014issues which may well have a different\nstatus.\nLet us now turn to the second issue flagged above. How far do\nmethodological naturalists in fact need to allow that\nmodality\u2014and mathematics and first-order morality\u2014do have\na different status from the synthetic a posteriori character\nthey attribute to philosophy in general?\nThe issues here are by no means clear-cut. In\nsections 1.7 and 1.8 above\nwe saw how the arguments for ontological naturalism placed general\nconstraints on the epistemological options in these area. By and large, these constraints tend to favour naturalism about philosophical method. There is no\nquestion of exploring these epistemological issues fully here, but\nsome brief comments will be in order.\nFor mathematics and modality, the epistemological possibilities\nwere restricted to irrealism and ontologically non-naturalist\nrealism. In the moral case, there were again irrealist options, and\nalso ontologically naturalist realisms that identified moral facts\nwith causally significant spatiotemporal facts.\nFor those who endorse irrealist options in any of these areas,\nthere would seem to be no tension with methodological\nnaturalism. After all, irrealist analyses deny that there is any\nsubstantial knowledge to be had in mathematics, modality or morality,\nand so will not think of object-level claims in these areas as\nthemselves contributing to philosophy. (This is consistent with\nthinking that a meta-understanding of the workings of mathematical,\nmodal or moral discourse is important to philosophy; but then there\nseems no reason why such a meta-understanding should be problematic\nfor methodological naturalism.)\nSimilarly, there seems no reason why the naturalist realist options\nin the moral case should be in tension with methodological naturalism.\nThe details deserve to be worked through, but on the face of things we\nmight expect knowledge of causally significant spatiotemporal moral\nfacts to be synthetic and a posteriori.\nThis leaves us with non-naturalist realist accounts of mathematical\nand modal knowledge. As we saw earlier, the best options here appeal\nto the neo-Fregean programme of grounding knowledge of the\nmathematical and modal realms in a priori analytic\nprinciples. If this programme could be vindicated, then it would\nindeed violate the requirements of methodological naturalism. But, as\nobserved earlier, it seems at best an open question whether analytic\nprinciples have the power to take us to realist knowledge of the\nmathematical and modal realms.\n", "bibliography": {"categories": [], "cat_ref_text": {"ref_list": ["Alter, T. and Pereboom, D., 2019, \u201cRussellian Monism\u201d, <em>The\nStanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy</em> (Fall 2019 edition), Edward\nN.
