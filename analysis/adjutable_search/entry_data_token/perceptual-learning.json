Defining Perceptual Learning\n\nIn 1963, the psychologist Eleanor Gibson wrote a landmark survey\narticle on perceptual learning in which she purported to define the\nterm. According to Gibson, perceptual learning is \u201c[a]ny\nrelatively permanent and consistent change in the perception of a\nstimulus array, following practice or experience with this\narray\u2026\u201d (1963:\n 29).[1]\n Gibson\u2019s definition has three basic parts. First, perceptual\nlearning is long-lasting. Second, it is perceptual. Third, it is the\nresult of practice or experience. This entry expands on each of these\nfeatures of the definition.\n1.1 Perceptual Learning as Long-Term Perceptual Changes\n\nPerceptual learning involves long-term changes in perception.\nThis criterion rules out short term perceptual changes due to sensory\nadaptation (for more on sensory adaptation see Webster 2012). In the\nwaterfall illusion, for instance, a person who looks at a waterfall\nfor a minute, and then looks away at some rocks, sees the rocks as\nmoving even though they are not. This is a short-term change in\nperception, lasting perhaps for fifteen to thirty seconds. Since it is\nnot a long-term change in perception, however, it does not count as\nperceptual learning. In another short term adaptive change, a person\nwho goes indoors after walking through a blizzard may have trouble as\nher eyes adjust to the new lighting. There is a change in her\nperception as a result of her experience in the blizzard. But it is\nnot a long-term change, and so it does not count as perceptual\nlearning.\n\nWhile there are clear cases of long-term experience-induced perceptual\nchanges and clear cases of short-term experience-induced perceptual\nchanges, there may be intermediary cases where it is difficult to tell\nwhether they count as long-term or not. In such cases, in order to\ndetermine whether the case is a genuine case of perceptual learning,\nit may be necessary to look at the mechanisms involved (see\n section 2\n below on the mechanisms of perceptual learning). If the mechanisms\ninvolved are characteristic of other cases of perceptual learning,\nthen that is a reason to count the case as an instance of perceptual\nlearning. If the mechanisms involved are uncharacteristic of\nperceptual learning, then that is a reason not to count the case as an\ninstance of perceptual learning.\n1.2 Perceptual Learning as Perceptual Changes\n\nPerceptual learning involves changes in\n perception.[2]\n This rules out mere changes in aesthetic taste, among other things.\nFor instance, imagine a contrarian who likes things only insofar as\nother people do not like those things. Suppose he finds out that\neveryone else has come to like his favorite microbrew. This might\ncause him to change how he judges that beer aesthetically. However,\nthe beer may well taste the same to him. So, it is not a case of\nperceptual learning, but a mere change in the person\u2019s aesthetic\njudgment. The fact that perceptual learning involves changes in\nperception also rules out mere changes in belief. Suppose someone\nacquires the belief that the symphony movement they are hearing is a\nscherzo. If nothing changes in that person\u2019s perception, this is\nnot a case of perceptual learning. It is a change in the\nperson\u2019s belief, not a change in the person\u2019s\nperception.\n\nIt is important here to distinguish perceptual learning from learning\nthat is simply based on perception (see Dretske 2015: fn.\n 6).[3]\n Perceptual learning involves changes in perception, while learning\nthat is based on perception need not. Looking at my table, I might\nlearn that the cup is on the table. However, this does not involve any\nlong-term changes in perception. It is learning that is based on\nperception, but it is not perceptual learning. Furthermore, I might\nlearn to put the cup on the table into the dishwasher every time it is\nempty. Again, this is learning that is based on perception (I need to\nperceive the cup in order to move it). However, it is not perceptual\nlearning. \n\nOne of the main reasons for holding that improvements in perceptual\ndiscrimination can be genuinely perceptual is due to somewhat recent\nevidence from neuroscience. As Manfred Fahle puts it, during the 1970s\nand 1980s, it tended to be the case that improvements in perceptual\ndiscrimination were thought to be cognitive rather than perceptual\n(2002: xii). However, during the 1990s, pressure was put on the\ncognitive interpretation due to new neuroscientific evidence in\nperceptual learning studies. In particular, studies found that\nlearning-induced plasticity occurs in the adult primary sensory\ncortices much more than researchers had previously thought (Fahle\n2002: xii). Neurological evidence of plasticity in adult primary\nsensory cortices due to learning provides some evidence that changes\nin perceptual discrimination can be due to perceptual learning. (See\nalso Garraghty & Kass 1992: 522; Gilbert 1996: 269; Goldstone\n2003: 238; Gilbert & Li 2012: 250; and Sagi 2011:\n1552\u201353).\n1.3 Perceptual Learning as Resulting from Practice or Experience\n\nPerceptual learning involves perceptual changes of a particular kind,\nnamely, those that result from practice or experience. For this\nreason, laser eye surgery or cataracts removal do not count as\ninstances of perceptual learning. They are not really cases of\nlearning because they do not result from practice or experience. So,\nwhile such cases involve long-term changes in perception, they do not\ncount as cases of perceptual learning.\n\nTo be authentic cases of learning, perceptual changes have to be the\nresult of a learning process. As a contrast case, suppose someone\nundergoes a long-term change in their perception due to a brain\nlesion. Such a change in perception does not result from a learning\nprocess, since the change in perception comes from the lesion, rather\nfrom practice or experience. Because of this, the case does not count\nas an instance of perceptual learning, even though it involves a\nlong-term change in perception.\n1.4 Potential Further Criteria for Defining Perceptual Learning\n\nThe conversation above roughly follows Eleanor Gibson\u2019s\ndefinition of perceptual learning. However, there are also other\naccounts in the psychology literature. Robert Goldstone\u2019s\naccount of perceptual learning, for instance, agrees with\nGibson\u2019s account in many respects, but it additionally offers a\nstory of why perceptual changes occur. On his account, \n\n\nPerceptual learning involves relatively long-lasting changes to an\norganism\u2019s perceptual system that improve its ability to respond\nto its environment and are caused by this environment. (1998:\n587, italics added for emphasis) \n\n\nThis definition offers an answer to the question as to why perceptual\nlearning occurs at all. On Goldstone\u2019s account, perceptual\nlearning occurs to improve an organism\u2019s ability to respond to\nthe environment.\n\nGoldstone\u2019s account admits of two different interpretations. On\none interpretation, the account places a condition on perceptual\nlearning: that to count as an instance of perceptual learning, a\nlong-term perceptual change has to improve an organism\u2019s ability\nto respond to the environment. Such an account gains plausibility if\none thinks of \u201clearning\u201d as a success-term. The idea then\nis that each genuine instance of perceptual learning leads to success\nfor the organism, namely, it improves the organism\u2019s ability to\nrespond to the environment. On a second interpretation of\nGoldstone\u2019s account, however, it is not that each instance of\nperceptual learning has to improve an organism\u2019s ability to\nrespond to the environment. Rather, it is that perceptual learning is\na general capacity for improving an organism\u2019s ability to\nrespond to the environment, even if perceptual learning fails to do so\nin some instances. Why might organisms have such a capacity? One\npossibility is that the capacity is a trait that improves fitness and\nis the product of natural selection. However, the biological origin of\nperceptual learning is an area of research that still needs to be\ncarefully explored. \n1.5 Contrast Classes\n1.5.1 Perceptual Development\n\nHow much of the perceptual development we undergo as infants and young\nchildren is the result of learning? There are many difficulties\ndistinguishing development from learning, conceptually (for some\ndiscussion, see Carey 2009, especially pp. 11\u201314). The issue of\nhow to distinguish development from learning bears on the traditional\nphilosophical debate between nativists and empiricists (see Markie\n2015, for a summary of that debate). In the perceptual learning\nliterature, for instance, Kellman and Garrigan reject the view that\nall perceptual development is the result of learning, a view that they\nconsider to be empiricist (2009: 57). Specifically, they think that\ndata on infant perception collected in and around the 1980s provide\nevidence that at least some perceptual development is innate:\n\n\nWhat this research has shown is that the traditional empiricist\npicture of perceptual development is incorrect. Although perception\nbecomes more precise with age and experience, basic capacities of all\nsorts \u2013 such as the abilities to perceive objects, faces,\nmotion, three-dimensional space, the directions of sounds, coordinate\nthe senses in perceiving events, and other abilities \u2013 arise\nprimarily from innate or early-maturing mechanisms (Bushnell, Sai,\n& Mullin 1989; Gibson et al., 1979; Held 1985; Kellman &\nSpelke 1983; Meltzoff & Moore 1977; and Slater, Mattock, &\nBrown 1990). (Kellman & Garrigan 2009: 57)\n\n\nIn short, according to Kellman and Garrigan, evidence on infant\nperception\u2014including evidence about object perception, the\nperception of faces, and the perception of three-dimensional\nspace\u2014tells against the view that all perceptual development is\nlearned.\n\nIf not all perceptual development is learned, while all perceptual\nlearning is learned, then there is a distinction between perceptual\ndevelopment and perceptual learning. One way to draw the distinction\nmore fully is the following. Perceptual development involves\nperceptual learning. However, it does not just involve perceptual\nlearning. It also involves what is called maturation. For\ninstance, the abilities that Kellman and Garrigan describe above\n(object perception, the perception of faces, the perception of\nthree-dimensional space, etc.) fall under the category of\nmaturation.\n\nThere are many ways to try to draw the further distinction between\nperceptual maturation and perceptual learning. Some such ways are\nfound in the debate between nativism and empiricism (see Samet 2008\nand Markie 2015) and specifically in the difference between innate and\nacquired characteristics (see Griffiths 2009 and Cowie 2016). One\npotential criterion here is that cases of perceptual maturation\ninvolve perceptual abilities that are typical of the species, while\ncases of perceptual learning involve perceptual abilities that are not\ntypical of the species. This criterion seems to get it right for some\ninstances of perceptual learning, say, for those involved in\nbirdwatching. After all, the perceptual abilities acquired in\nbirdwatching are unique to birdwatchers, not typical of the entire\nhuman species. However, the criterion seems to get it wrong for other,\nmore universal, instances of perceptual learning. For instance, since\nhuman faces are both ubiquitous and important to humans, the\nperceptual learning involved in face perception is in fact typical of\nthe species.\n\nIn the literature on perceptual learning, by contrast, the distinction\nbetween perceptual learning and perceptual maturation is often drawn\nin terms of the role of the environment. On Goldstone\u2019s account\nof perceptual learning, to count as perceptual learning, perceptual\nchanges must be caused by the environment. It is important to\nunderstand why exactly Goldstone thinks that caused by the\nenvironment is a crucial feature of the definition. He thinks it\nis crucial since this criterion distinguishes between perceptual\nchanges that are simply the result of maturation, and perceptual\nchanges that are the result of learning. As Goldstone puts it,\n\u201cIf the changes are not due to environmental inputs, then\nmaturation rather than learning is implicated\u201d (1998: 586).\nManfred Fahle puts it similarly by saying that the term\nmaturation \u201cascribe[s] the main thrust of the changes\nin a behavior to genetics, not the environment\u201d (2002: xi). For\nFahle, this is what distinguishes it from perceptual learning. \n1.5.2 Perception-Based Skills\n\nA further point of contrast with perceptual learning is\nperception-based skills, such as dart-throwing or racecar driving. To\nunderstand the relationship between perceptual learning and\nperception-based skills, start by considering the following case.\nWilliams and Davids (1998) reported that when expert soccer players\ndefend opponents, they focus longer on their opponent\u2019s hips\nthan non-experts do. This tuned attention is a long-term change in\nperception that results from practice or experience. That is, it is an\ninstance of perceptual learning (see\n section 2.3\n below). Such changes certainly serve to enable perception-based\nskills. For instance, attending to the hips is part of what enables\nthe soccer players to defend well. Since the hips provide a cue for\nwhat the offensive player will do next, when the defender attends\nthere, it helps them to do all sorts of things: to keep the offensive\nplayer from dribbling by them; to keep the offensive player from\ncompleting a pass; and to keep them from shooting and scoring. Without\nthe attentional tuning, the expert soccer players would not be able to\nperform as high above baseline as they do.\n\nPerceptual learning can enable perception-based skills, yet it is\nimportant to distinguish these skills from perceptual learning. In\nfact, arguably, as Stanley and Krakauer (2013) claim, perceptual\nlearning does not in itself give you a skill, properly speaking. One\nreason why, drawing on Stanley and Krakauer, is that skills quite\nplausibly require instruction (at least initially), or observation of\nsomeone else (2013: 3). Perceptual learning, by contrast, can at times\nbe unsupervised learning (see Goldstone 2003: 241 and Goldstone &\nByrge 2015: section 3). Long-term, learning-induced changes in\nperception sometimes happen through mere exposure to stimuli, and\nwithout any instruction whatsoever. Furthermore, arguably, as Stanley\nand Krakauer put it, \u201cour skilled actions are always under our\nrational control\u2026\u201d (2013: 3; see also Stanley &\nWilliamson forthcoming: 6). Yet, there is an important sense in which\none cannot control a tuned attentional pattern like that of the expert\nsoccer players mentioned above. Goldstone, for instance, cites a study\non attentional tuning by Shiffrin and Schneider (1977). In that study,\nletters were used first as targets in the experiment, but later\nletters were used as distractors to be ignored (Goldstone 1998: 589).\nDue to their prior training with the letters, the subjects\u2019\nattention became automatic with respect to the letters in the scene,\neven though they were trying to deliberately ignore them. More\ngenerally, after training, it is difficult to rationally control a\ntuned attentional pattern because the attention is automatic toward\nparticular properties.\n1.5.3 Cognitive Penetration\n\nPerceptual learning involves changes in perception that are\nlong-term. This long-term criterion rules out some cases of\ncognitive penetration, that is, cases where one\u2019s beliefs,\nthoughts, or desires influence one\u2019s perception (see Macpherson\n2012: 24). For instance, to borrow a case from Susanna Siegel (2012),\nif Jill sees Jack as angry because she just now believes Jack is\nangry, this need not be a case of perceptual learning, since it need\nnot be a long-term change. After all, if Jill changes her belief that\nJack is angry shortly after, she will no longer see his neutral face\nas angry. It would be a short-term change in her perception, not a\nlong-term one. And so it would not be a case of perceptual\nlearning.\n\nSimply because some cases of cognitive penetration are not cases of\nperceptual learning, however, it does not follow that no cases of\ncognitive penetration are cases of perceptual learning. Jerry Fodor\ndistinguishes between synchronic penetration and diachronic\npenetration, where only the latter involves \u201cexperience and\ntraining\u201d (1984: 39). The case of Jack and Jill is a case of\nsynchronic penetration, one where the penetration does not involve\nexperience and training. However, at least some cases of perceptual\nlearning might more plausibly fit into the category of diachronic\npenetration. (For more on the relationship between perceptual learning\nand cognitive penetration, see\n section 3.2)\n1.5.4 Machine Learning\n\nMachine perception seeks \u201cto enable man-made machines to\nperceive their environments by sensory means as human and animals\ndo\u201d (Nevatia 1982: 1). Standard cases of machine perception\ninvolve computers that are able to recognize speech, faces, or types\nof objects. Some types of machine perception are simply programmed\ninto the device. For instance, some speech recognition devices\n(especially older ones) are simply programmed to recognize speech, and\ndo not learn beyond what they have been programmed to do. Other types\nof machine perception involve \u201cmachine learning\u201d where the\ndevice learns based on the inputs that it receives, often involving\nsome kind of feedback.\n\nLike cases of perceptual learning, machine learning can be either\nsupervised or unsupervised, although these distinctions mean something\nvery specific in the machine case. In supervised learning, builders\ntest the machine\u2019s initial performance on, say, the recognition\nof whether a given image contains a face. They then measure the\nperformance error and adjust the parameters of the machine to improve\nperformance (LeCun, Bengio, & Hinton 2015: 436). Importantly, in\ncases of supervised learning, engineers program into the machine which\nfeatures it should look for when, say, identifying a face. In cases of\nunsupervised learning, by contrast, the machine does not have\ninformation about its target features. The machine merely aims to find\nsimilarities in the given images, and if it is successful, the machine\ncomes to group all the faces together according to their similarities\n(Dy & Brodley 2004: 845).\n\nIn machine learning, one major difficulty is that machines can develop\nracist and sexist patterns (for several examples, see Crawford 2016).\nThe problem is often that engineers input a biased set of images (such\nas a set of images that include too many white people) into the\nmachine, from which the machine builds its model (Crawford 2016). This\nsuggests a potential corresponding source of bias in human perceptual\nlearning, based on the inputs that humans receive through media. \n2. Varieties of Perceptual Learning\n\nThe psychology literature provides ample evidence of perceptual\nlearning. Goldstone (1998) helpfully distinguishes between four\ndifferent types of perceptual learning in the literature:\ndifferentiation, unitization, attentional weighting, and stimulus\nimprinting. This section surveys these four types of perceptual\nlearning (for further review, see Goldstone 2003; Goldstone,\nBraithwaite, & Byrge 2012; and Goldstone & Byrge 2015).\n2.1 Differentiation\n\nWhen most people reflect on perceptual learning, the cases that tend\nto come to mind are cases of differentiation. In\ndifferentiation, a person comes to perceive the difference between two\nproperties, where they could not perceive this difference before. It\nis helpful to think of William James\u2019 case of a person learning\nto distinguish between the upper and lower half of a particular kind\nof wine. Prior to learning, one cannot perceive the difference between\nthe upper and lower half. However, through practice one becomes able\nto distinguish between the upper and lower half. This is a paradigm\ncase of differentiation.\n\nPsychologists have studied differentiation in lab environments. In one\nsuch study, experimenters took six native Japanese speakers who had\nlived in the United States from between six months and three years\n(Logan, Lively, & Pisoni 1991). The subjects were not native English speakers. The\nexperimenters found that they were able to train these subjects to\nbetter distinguish between the phonemes /r/ and /l/. This is a case of\nimproved differentiation, where the subjects became better at\nperceiving the difference between two properties, which they had more\ntrouble telling apart before.\n2.2 Unitization\n\nUnitization is the counterpart to differentiation. In unitization, a\nperson comes to perceive as a single property, what they previously\nperceived as two or more distinct properties. One example of\nunitization is the perception of written words. When we perceive a\nwritten word in English, we do not simply perceive two or more\ndistinct letters. Rather, we perceive those letters as a single word.\nPut another way, we perceive written words as a single unit (see Smith\n& Haviland 1972). This is not the case with non-words. When we\nperceive short strings of letters that are not words, we do not\nperceive them as a single unit. Goldstone and Byrge provide a list of\nitems for which there is empirical evidence of such unitization: \n\n\nbirds, words, grids of lines, random wire structures, fingerprints,\nartificial blobs, and three-dimensional creatures made from simple\ngeometric components. (2015: 823)\n\n\nWhile unitization and differentiation are converses, the one unifying\nand the other distinguishing, Goldstone and Byrge also conceive of\nthem as \u201cflip sides of the same coin\u201d (2015: 823). This is\nbecause, as they put it, both unitization and differentiation\n\u201cinvolve creating perceptual units\u2026\u201d (2015: 823).\nRegardless of whether the unit arises from the fusion or the\ndifferentiation of two other units, both instances of perceptual\nlearning involve the creation of new perceptual units.\n2.3 Attentional Weighting\n\nIn attentional weighting, through practice or experience people come\nto systematically attend toward certain objects and properties and\naway from other objects and properties. Paradigm cases of attentional\nweighting have been shown in sports studies, where it has been found,\nfor instance, that expert fencers attend more to their\nopponents\u2019 upper trunk area, while non-experts attend more to\ntheir opponents\u2019 upper leg area (Hagemann et al., 2010). Practice or experience\nmodulates attention as fencers learn, shifting it towards certain\nareas and away from other areas.\n\nIn the case of the expert fencer, a shift in the weight of attention\nto the opponents\u2019 upper trunk area facilitates the\nexpert\u2019s fencing skills. However, shifts in attentional\nweighting can also fail to facilitate skills or even stifle them. For\nexample, a new golfer with inadequate coaching might develop the bad\nhabit of attending to their putter while putting, rather than learning\nto keep their \u201ceye on the ball.\u201d This unhelpful shift in\nattentional weighting may well stifle the new golfer\u2019s ability\nto become a skillful putter.\n\nOne way to understand weighted attention is as attention that has\nbecome automatic with respect to particular properties. In\nother words, when the expert fencer attends to the upper trunk area,\nthis attention is no longer governed by her intention (see Wu 2014:\n33, for more on this account of automaticity). Rather, as the result\nof practice, the expert fencer\u2019s attention is now automatic\nwith respect to the trunk area. This italicized part is\nimportant. On Wayne Wu\u2019s account of attention, for instance, one\nmight ask whether attention is automatic with respect to different\nfeatures of the process of attention: \u201cwhere attention is\ndirected and in what sequence, how long it is sustained, to what\nspecific features in the scene, and so on\u201d (p. 34). In the case\nof the expert fencer, plausibly her attention is automatic with\nrespect to the trunk area, even if it is not automatic in other\nrespects. This automaticity is the product of her learning\nprocess.\n2.4 Stimulus Imprinting\n\nRecall that in unitization, what previously looked like two or more\nobjects, properties, or events later looks like a single object,\nproperty, or event. Cases of \u201cstimulus imprinting\u201d are\nlike cases of unitization in the end state (you detect a whole\npattern), but there is no need for the prior state\u2014no need for\nthat pattern to have previously looked like two or more objects,\nproperties, or events. This is because in stimulus imprinting, the\nperceptual system builds specialized detectors for whole stimuli or\nparts of stimuli to which a subject has been repeatedly exposed\n(Goldstone 1998: 591). Cells in the inferior temporal cortex, for\ninstance, can have a heightened response to particular familiar faces\n(Perrett et al., 1984, cited in Goldstone 1998: 594). One area where\nthese specialized detectors are helpful is with unclear or quickly\npresented stimuli (Goldstone 1998: 592). Stimulus imprinting happens\nentirely without guidance or supervision (Goldstone 2003: 241).\n3. The Philosophical Significance of Perceptual Learning\n\nPerceptual learning is philosophically significant both in itself, and\nfor the role that it has played in prior philosophical discussions.\nSections\n 3.1\u20133.4\n will focus on the latter. However, there are good reasons to see\nperceptual learning as philosophically significant in itself,\nindependently from the role that it has played in prior philosophical\ndiscussions.\n\nWhy is perceptual learning philosophically significant? One reason is\nthat it says something about the very nature of perception\u2014that\nperception is more complex than it might seem from the first-person\npoint of view. Specifically, the fact that perceptual learning occurs\nmeans that the causes of perceptual states are not just the objects in\nour immediate environment, as it seems at first glance. Rather, given\nthe reality of perceptual learning, there is a long causal history to\nour perceptions that involves prior perception. When the expert\nwine-taster tastes the Cabernet Sauvignon, for example, that glass of\nwine alone is not the sole cause of her perceptual state. Rather, the\ncause of her perceptual state includes prior wines and prior\nperceptions of those wines. One way to put this is to say that\nperception is more than the immediate inputs into our senses. It is\ntied to our prior experiences.\n\nAnother way in which perceptual learning is philosophically\nsignificant is because it shows how perception is a product of both\nthe brain and the world. In this respect, there are some similarities\nbetween the role of constancy mechanisms and the role of perceptual\nlearning, in that both involve the brain playing a role in structuring\nperception in a way that goes beyond the perceptual input. Constancy\nmechanisms, such as those involved in shape, size, and color\nconstancy, are brain mechanisms that allow us to perceive shapes,\nsizes, and colors more stably across variations in distance or\nillumination. In cases of constancy, the brain manipulates the input\nfrom the world, and this allows the perceiver to track the shape,\nsize, or color more easily. Similarly, in cases of perceptual\nlearning, the brain manipulates the input from the world. In many\ncases, this may actually make the perception more helpful, as when\nthrough learning the perceptual system weights attention in a\nparticular way, say, towards the features relevant for identifying a\nCabernet Sauvignon. Perceptual learning might upgrade the epistemic\nstatus of perception, putting the perceiver in a better position with\nrespect to knowledge (see Siegel 2017). At the same time, people can\nlearn incorrectly, leading to perceptions that are unhelpful, as when\na new golfer with inadequate coaching develops the bad habit of\nattending to their putter while putting, rather than attending to the\ngolf ball.\n\nPerceptual learning is philosophically significant in itself. In\naddition, the rest of section 3 goes on to explore the role that\nperceptual learning has played in prior philosophical discussions.\n3.1 The Contents of Perception\n\nIn the philosophy literature, cases of perceptual learning have often\nbeen used to show that through learning we come to represent new\nproperties in perception, which we did not represent prior to\nlearning. Siegel (2006, 2010), for instance, asks us to suppose that\nwe have been tasked to cut down all and only the pine trees in a\nparticular grove of trees. After several months pass, she says, pine\ntrees might begin to look different to us. This is a case of\nperceptual learning, a long-term change in our perception following\npractice or experience with pine trees. Siegel uses the case to argue\nthat perception comes to represent kind properties, like the property\nof being a pine tree. The idea is that the best way to\nexplain the change in perception is that perception represents the\nproperty of being a pine tree after, but not before, learning\ntakes place. That property becomes part of the content of perception:\nit comes to be presented in perceptual experience (for more background\non the contents of perception, see Siegel 2016).\n\nThomas Reid\u2019s notion of acquired perception has\nrecently been interpreted in a way similar to Siegel\u2019s pine tree\ncase. According to Reid, some of our perceptions, namely acquired\nperceptions, are the result of prior experience. For instance, Reid\nwrites about how through experience we might come to \u201cperceive\nthat this is the taste of cyder,\u201d or \u201cthat this is the\nsmell of an apple,\u201d or that \u201cthis [is] the sound of a\ncoach passing\u201d ([1764] 1997: 171). Rebecca Copenhaver (2010,\n2016) has interpreted Reid as claiming that through experience\nproperties like being a cider, being an apple, and\nbeing a coach can come to be part of the content of our\nperception. \n\nCases of perceptual learning might also be used to show that through\nlearning we come to represent new properties in perception, even if\nthose properties are simply low-level properties like colors, shapes,\ntextures, and bare sounds, rather than high-level kind properties like\nbeing a pine tree or being a cider. For instance, in\ndiscussing the perceptual expertise of jewelers, the\n14th-century Hindu philosopher Ved\u0101nta De\u015bika\nwrites, \n\n\n[T]he difference among colours [of a precious stone], which was first\nconcealed by their similarity, is eventually made apparent as\nsomething sensual\u2026. (Freschi [trans.] manuscript,\nOther Internet Resources,  pp. 12\u201313)\n\n\nIn this case, the jeweler comes to perceive new colors in the\ngemstone, which others cannot perceive. This is a case where through\nlearning someone comes to perceive a new low-level property.\n\nThe cases from both Reid and Ved\u0101nta De\u015bika both speak to\nthe internal complexity of perception mentioned in the previous\nsection. If Ved\u0101nta De\u015bika\u2019s description of the\njeweler case is accurate, then perception is more than the inputs into\nour senses, since both an expert jeweler and a non-expert can have the\nsame visual inputs, but have different perceptions. Similarly, to take\na new example from Reid, suppose that a farmer acquires the ability to\nliterally see the rough amount corn in a heap ([1764] 1997: 172).\nSince both a farmer and a non-farmer can have the same visual inputs,\nbut have different perceptions, the causes of their perceptions are\nnot just restricted to the immediate objects out in their environment.\nPerception is more complex than that.\n\nOne of the most detailed contemporary discussions of cases of\nperceptual learning is found in Siewert (1998: section 7.9). Siewert\ndiscusses in detail the role that learning plays in altering\nperceptual phenomenology, although he stops short of saying that this\naffects the high-level contents of perception. He writes, for\ninstance, that there is a difference in perceptual phenomenology\nbetween just seeing \u201csomething shaped, situated, and colored in\na certain way,\u201d and recognizing that thing as a sunflower (or\nanother type) (1998: 255). Siewert also writes that a person might\nlook different to you after you know them for a long time than they\ndid the first time you met them, and that your neighborhood might look\ndifferent to you after you have lived there for a long time than the\nfirst time you moved in (pp. 256, 258). Furthermore, he writes about\nhow a chessboard in midgame might look differently to a chess player\nthan to a novice, and how a car engine might look differently to a\nmechanic than to someone unfamiliar with cars (1998: 258). These are\nall examples where learning affects one\u2019s sensory\nphenomenology.\n\nSeveral cases of perceptual learning in the philosophical literature\ninvolve language learning, both in the case of written and spoken\nlanguage. As an example of the former, Christopher Peacocke writes\nthat there is a difference \n\n\nbetween the experience of a perceiver completely unfamiliar with\nCyrillic script seeing a sentence in that script and the experience of\none who understands a language written in that script. (1992: 89) \n\n\nWith regard to spoken language, as Casey O\u2019Callaghan (2011)\npoints out, several philosophers have made the claim that after a\nperson learns a spoken language, sounds in that language comes to\nsound different to them (O\u2019Callaghan cites Block 1995: 234;\nStrawson 2010: 5\u20136; Tye 2000: 61; Siegel 2006: 490; Prinz 2006:\n452; and Bayne 2009: 390). Ned Block, for instance, writes,\n\u201c[T]here is a difference in what it is like to hear sounds in\nFrench before and after you have learned the language\u201d (1995:\n234). It is tempting to think that this difference is explicable in\nterms of the fact that, after learning a language, a person hears the\nmeanings of the words, where they do not before learning the language.\nOn such a view, meanings would be part of the contents of auditory\nperception. However, O\u2019Callaghan (2011) denies this (see also\nO\u2019Callaghan 2015 and Reiland 2015). He argues that the\ndifference is in fact due to a kind of perceptual learning.\nSpecifically, through learning we come to hear phonological features\nspecific to the new language. As O\u2019Callaghan argues, these\nphonological features, not the meanings, explain what it\u2019s like\nto hear a new language.\n\nBy contrast, Brogaard (forthcoming) argues that meanings are in fact\npart of the content of perception (see also Pettit 2010). After\noffering arguments against the opposing view, she relies on evidence\nabout perceptual learning to help make the positive case for her view.\nIn particular, she uses evidence about perceptual learning to rebut\nthe view that we use background information about context and combine\nit with what we hear, in order to get meanings. Instead, she argues,\nlanguage learning is perceptual in nature. She points to changes in\nhow we perceive utterances, more in chunks rather than in parts, as a\nresult of learning. Background information directly influences what we\nhear, she argues, altering how language sounds to us.\n\nBoth Siegel\u2019s pine tree case and the case of hearing a new\nlanguage fundamentally involve phenomenal contrasts. That is, the\nmotivating intuition in both cases is that there is a contrast in\nsensory phenomenology between two perceptual experiences.\nInterestingly, in both cases the phenomenal contrast is due to\nlearning. The question in both the pine tree case and the new language\ncase is what explains the difference in sensory phenomenology. Siegel\nargues that the best explanation in the pine tree case is that the\nproperty of being a pine (and, more generally, natural kind\nproperties) can come to be represented in perception.\nO\u2019Callaghan (2011) argues that the best explanation for the\ndifference in sensory phenomenology in the new language case is that\nwe come to hear phonological features specific to the new language.\nBrogaard (forthcoming) argues that the best explanation in that case\nis that we come to hear meanings in the new language.\n3.2 Cognitive Penetration\n\nRecall that cases of cognitive penetration are cases where one\u2019s\nbeliefs, thoughts, or desires influence one\u2019s perception (see\nMacpherson 2012: 24). One role of perceptual learning in the\nphilosophical literature has been to explain away putative cases of\ncognitive penetration. For instance, it might seem at first glance\nthat Siegel\u2019s pine tree case is a case of cognitive penetration,\na case where one\u2019s newly acquired concept of a pine tree\ninfluences one\u2019s perception. Connolly (2014b) and Arstila (2016), however, have\nboth argued that the best way to understand Siegel\u2019s pine tree\ncase is not as a case of cognitive penetration, but rather through the\nparticular mechanisms of perceptual learning. Connolly counts it as a\ncase of attentional weighting, while Arstila understands it as\ninvolving both unitization and differentiation. \n\nOne reason why perceptual learning is a good instrument for explaining\naway putative cases of cognitive penetration is the following. In\ncases of perceptual learning, it is the external environment that\ndrives the perceptual changes. As Raftopoulos puts it,\n\u201cperceptual learning does not necessarily involve cognitive\ntop-down penetrability but only data-driven processes\u201d (2001:\n493). For putative cases of cognitive penetration, the strategy for\nthe perceptual learning theorist is to show how the perceptual changes\ninvolved may have been data-driven instead of top-down. Several\nphilosophers have used this strategy at times, including Pylyshyn\n(1999: section 6.3), Brogaard and Gatzia (2015: 2), as well as Stokes\n(2015: 94), and Deroy (2013) might be interpreted in that way as\nwell.\n\nOne exception to the trend of explaining away putative cases of\ncognitive penetration in terms of perceptual learning is Cecchi\n(2014). Cecchi argues that a particular case of perceptual\nlearning\u2014that found in Schwartz, Maquet, and Frith\n(2002)\u2014should count as a case of cognitive penetration. The\nstudy in question found changes in the primary visual cortex due to\nlearning, and also that these changes were brought about by higher\nareas in the brain influencing the primary visual cortex. Because the\nperceptual changes were the result of top-down influence, Cecchi\nargues that this case of perceptual learning should count as a case of\ncognitive penetration.\n3.3 The Theory-Ladenness of Observation\n\nOne traditional debate in the philosophy of science is whether\nscientific observation is permeated with the theory of the scientist,\nor theory-laden (see the entry on \n theory and observation in science). \n As Raftopoulos and Zeimbekis point out, when\nasking whether observation is theory-laden, the answer will depend in\npart on what it means for a subject to possess a theory (2015: 18). On\ntheir view, theories can be tacit, rather than just \u201chaving a\nset of beliefs and concepts\u201d (p. 18).\n\nAssuming that theories can be held tacitly, perceptual learning might\nplausibly play a role in making observation theory laden. Raftopoulos\nand Zeimbekis, for instance, ask us to imagine a scientist who has\nundergone perceptual learning in her expert domain (2015: 19).\nSpecifically, through repeated exposure to items in her expert domain,\nshe has developed perceptual sensitivity to certain features, in\naccordance with her professional needs. This includes learned\nattention to particular dimensions, and involves physical changes\nearly in her visual system (p. 19). As a result, the scientist might\nquite literally see the world differently within her expert domain\nthan someone from outside her expertise would see it.\n\nSuch a case suggests that perceptual learning can make observation\ntheory-laden. The scientist\u2019s perceptual system comes to shape\nthe kind of visual information that makes it into the\nscientist\u2019s conscious perception, and does so based on her\nprofessional needs. As Raftopoulos and Zeimbekis put it, the case\nsuggests \n\n\nthat non-cognitive, clearly perceptual influences on incoming visual\ninformation can be indirect bearers of the kinds of theoretical\ncommitments that we usually think of as the content of conceptually\ncouched theories. (2015: 19) \n\n\nAlthough the case does not involve explicit beliefs directly\ninfluencing perception, arguably it involves a theory being held\ntacitly and appropriated into one\u2019s perceptual system.\n3.4 Modularity\n\nAccording to the modular view of the mind (Fodor 1983), the basic systems involved\nin perception are encapsulated from information outside of it,\nexcluding its inputs (see Robbins 2015, for a summary of modularity).\nIt might then seem at first glance that cases of perceptual learning\nchallenge the view that the mind is modular, at least insofar as they\ninvolve the modulation of perception through any background theory\nthat the subject has. However, it is important to note that Fodor\nhimself seems to allow for such cases of perceptual learning. While he\nthinks that perception is synchronically impenetrable, he allows for\nthe possibility of diachronic penetration, that is, cases where\n\u201cexperience and training can affect the accessibility of\nbackground theory to perceptual mechanisms\u201d (1984: 39).\n\nWhy think that a modular view of the mind should allow for diachronic\npenetration? When Fodor allows for diachronic penetration, he does so\nbecause the alternative is to say that all modular systems are\nspecified endogenously (1984: 39). Fodor admits that this alternative\nwould be too extreme, and he points out, for instance, that children\nlearn something from hearing a language. In other words, the modules\nfor language are not just specified endogenously. However, Fodor is\nconservative about the scope of diachronic penetration, suggesting\nthat it may only happen within strict limits, perhaps limits that are\nthemselves endogenously defined (1984: 39\u201340).\n\nOther philosophers have argued that diachronic penetration of\nperception undermines modularity. Churchland (1988), for instance,\nsees Fodor\u2019s allowance of diachronic penetration as\n\u201cgrudgingly conceded,\u201d and he argues that diachronic\npenetration is in fact widespread, rather than something that happens\nwithin strict limits (p. 176). One such case, raised by Churchland, is\nthe case of perceiving music. Churchland argues that a person who\nknows the relevant music theory and vocabulary \u201cperceives, in\nany composition whether great or mundane, a structure, development,\nand rationale that is lost on the untrained ear\u201d (1988: 179).\nFodor replies that it is unclear whether such cases are genuinely\nperceptual (1988: 195). He suggests another possibility, which is that the\nperson who knows the relevant music theory does not perceive it\ndifferently, but rather forms different beliefs about the music.\nFurthermore, even if the case is genuinely perceptual, Fodor replies\nthat it could be that a trained ear results simply from repeated\nexposure to the relevant music, rather than through knowledge of\ntheory (1988: 195).\n", "bibliography": {"categories": [], "cat_ref_text": {"ref_list": ["Ahissar, Merav &amp; Shaul Hochstein, 2004, \u201cThe Reverse\nHierarchy Theory of Visual Perceptual Learning\u201d, <em>Trends in\ncognitive sciences</em>, 8(10): 457\u2013464.\ndoi:10.1016/j.tics.2004.08.011", "Arstila, Valtteri, 2016, \u201cPerceptual Learning\nExplains Two Candidates for Cognitive Penetration\u201d,\n<em>Erkenntnis</em>, 81(6): 1151\u20131172.\ndoi:10.1007/s10670-015-9785-3", "Bao, Min, Lin Yang, Cristina Rios, Bin He, &amp; Stephen A.
