Ontological and Metaphysical Commitments in Biomedicine\n\nBiomedicine is built around a conception of disease as a disfunction\nof particular physical parts (organs, tissues, cells) of the body.\nDespite being hegemonic in the global research community,\nbiomedicine\u2019s ontological and metaphysical commitments are not\nself-evident, historically long-lived, nor universally embraced. In\ncontrasting Classical Chinese Medicine with biomedicine, Lee explains\nthat biomedicine is set apart by \n\n\nthe metaphysical thesis that only what is ascertainable by means of\nthe five senses and by extension the use of instrumentation is real\nand exists \n\n\nand a connected epistemic claim that legitimate health knowledge must\ncome to us via those means (Lee 2017: 2).\n",
