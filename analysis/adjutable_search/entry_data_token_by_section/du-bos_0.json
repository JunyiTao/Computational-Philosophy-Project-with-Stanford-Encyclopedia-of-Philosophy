    "main_text": "Life and works\n1. Life and works\n\nDu Bos was born in Beauvais on 14 December 1670. Little is known of\nhis family or childhood. He was educated in Paris, where he received a\nMaster of Arts in 1688 and a Bachelor of Theology in 1692. Although\nlater in life he was a titular abb\u00e9 and canon, he seems to have\nhad little interest in the ecclesiastical life. He was more interested\nin politics and in the life of a man of letters and he soon moved in\nleading intellectual circles. His friends included Nicolas\nBoileau-D\u00e9spreaux, an important poet and literary critic,\nCharles Perrault, another major poet, and Pierre Bayle, the famous\nphilosopher. He was a friend of Jean Jacques-Rousseau though, as was\noften the case with Rousseau\u2019s friendships, the friendship did\nnot endure. Du Bos was particularly closely associated with Bayle, who\nhad an important impact on Du Bos\u2019s thought. Du Bos traveled\nextensively in Europe in his capacity as a diplomat and in order to\nmeet the leading intellectuals of the day. Lombard (1913) remains the\nstandard account of his life.\n\nDu Bos\u2019s first book was Histoire de Quatre Gordiens,\nprouv\u00e9e et illustr\u00e9e par les M\u00e9dailles\n(History of the Four Gordians, Proven and Illustrated by\nMedallions) (1695). In this work, he argued, on the basis of\nnumismatic evidence, that there had been four, not three Gordian\nemperors. His hypothesis was quickly refuted by historians.\n\nDu Bos worked as a diplomat and was involved in negotiating a peace\ntreaty between the Netherlands and France. In this connection, he\nwrote Les Interests de l\u2019Angleterre mal entendus dans la\nguerre pr\u00e9sente (England\u2019s Interests in the\nPresent War Misunderstood) (1703).\n\nHis next book was L\u2019Histoire de la Ligue de\nCambray (History of the League of Cambrai). This was a\nclear and engaging history of the alliance, including France,\nassembled by Pope Julius II to wage war against the Venetian Republic\nbetween 1508 and 1516. The book was praised by, among others,\nVoltaire.\n\nDu Bos travelled to England in 1698 to meet John Locke at the request\nof their mutual friend Nicolas Toinard. Toinard wanted advice on the\npreparation of a translation of Locke\u2019s Essay concerning\nHuman Understanding. Locke and Du Bos became close friends and\nLocke asked his French friend to review the French translation of the\nEssay. The influence of Locke\u2019s empiricism is evident\nthroughout the Critical Reflections.\n\nIn 1719 Du Bos published R\u00e9flexions critiques sur la\npo\u00e9sie et sur la peinture (Critical Reflections on\nPoetry and Painting), the book on which his posthumous reputation\ndepends. Further editions appeared in 1732, 1733, 1740, 1746, 1755,\n1760, and 1770. The work was significantly expanded and revised for\nthe 1740 and subsequent editions. It was translated into German,\nDutch, and English. Largely on the basis of the Critical\nReflections, Du Bos was elected to the Acad\u00e9mie\nfran\u00e7aise in 1720. He became perpetual secretary of the\nAcad\u00e9mie in 1723.\n\nDu Bos\u2019s final major work was the Histoire critique de\nl\u2019\u00e9tablissement de la monarchie fran\u00e7aise dans les\nGaules (Critical History of the Establishment of the French\nMonarchy in Gaul) (1734). The book\u2019s thesis is that the\nFranks did not conquer Gaul. Rather, according to Du Bos, the Gauls\ninvited them to become the rulers of what became France. The book won\nthe praise of many, including Edward Gibbon, but it was effectively\ncriticized by Montesquieu in The Spirit of the Laws.\n\nBy all accounts, Du Bos was a pleasant and charming man. Many\naffectionate remembrances were published in the wake of his death on\n23 March 1742.\n",
