Absent a distinctively constructivist semantics, some think\nthat constructivism is best understood as \u201ca family of\nsubstantive moral theories\u201d (Darwall et al. 1992: 140;\nHussain & Shah 2006, 2013; Enoch 2009; Hussain 2012; Ridge 2012).\nFor some this means that constructivism does not qualify as a\nmetaethical theory: in seeking to understand normative concepts as\nreferring to solutions to practical problems, constructivism does not\nmove \u201cup to metaethics\u201d, insofar as this talk of problems\nand their solutions \u201cis itself normative talk\u201d (Ridge\n2012).\n\nThis criticism rests on the assumption that there is a sharp division\nbetween normative ethics and metaethics. The constructivist project is\nto advance our understanding of moral principles and their limits by\n\u201cclarifying our understanding of the reasons that make familiar\nmoral principles ones that no one could reasonably reject\u201d\n(Scanlon 1998: 246\u2013247; 2003a: 429\u2013435). The purpose of\ntheorizing in ethics is partly interpretive and partly normative.\nThus, there seems to be a disagreement between constructivists and\ntheir critics about what it takes to engage in a metaethical inquiry.\nFor the constructivist, there is an interesting continuity between\nnormative discourse and metaethics.\n\nFurthermore, some constructivists account for their lack of interest\nin semantics with the conviction that the semantic task with which\ntraditional metaethics is preoccupied is positively misguided\n(Korsgaard 1996a, 2003; Street 2008a: 239). The philosophical issue\nworth thinking about is normativity, and this is not something that we\ncan explain solely via semantics. For Kantians, explaining normativity\nrequires philosophers to engage in philosophical investigation into\nthe ideas of autonomy, agency, and practical rationality (see\n section 7).\n\nWhile also preoccupied with explaining normativity, other\nconstructivists view the semantic task as worthwhile (Street 2010;\nRichardson 2013). In fact, they take themselves to discharge the\nsemantic task with their account of what is constitutive of the\nattitude of valuing. By identifying the constitutive norms that one\nmust be following in order to count as a rational valuer at all, some\nconstructivists have sketched \n\n\na so-called inferentialist semantics for normative terms: the meaning\nof normative terms is explained by identifying the kinds of inferences\n(for example, about means and ends) one must be making in order to\ncount as employing normative concepts at all. (Street 2010:\n239\u2013242) \n\n\nThis reply commits the constructivist to showing that her proposal has\nsome advantages over its competitors.\n",
