    "main_text": "Objections to the Theory of Descriptions || The challenge to Russell\u2019s truth conditions\n5.1 The challenge to Russell\u2019s truth conditions\n\nStrawson (1950) objected that Russell\u2019s theory is simply\nincorrect about the truth conditions of sentences like \u2018The\npresent king of France is bald\u2019. According to Russell\u2019s\nanalysis, this sentence is false (since it contains an existence claim\nto the effect that there is a present king of France), but according\nto Strawson, this does not conform to our intuitions about the truth\nof an utterance of that sentence. In Strawson\u2019s view, an\nutterance of the sentence in a world where there is no present king of\nFrance is neither true nor false; perhaps the sentence has a truth\nvalue gap, or perhaps it fails to express a determinate proposition\n(Strawson vacillated on this), but either way it does not appear to be\nfalse. Strawson held that this fact supported a referential\ninterpretation of expressions like \u2018The present king of\nFrance\u2019.\n\nIf there is no present king of France, then an utterance containing\nsuch an expression is somehow defective. It is as if I looked into my\ndesk drawer, not allowing you to see what I was looking at, and said\n\u2018that is a fine green one.\u2019 Strawson held that utterances\nlike these do not entail the existence of a fine green one or the\npresent King of France, but rather presuppose their\nexistence. If the expressions fail to refer, then there is a\npresupposition failure and the utterance fails to have a determinate\ntruth value. (Notice that this sort of failure is not supposed to\nundermine the meaningfulness of the sentences that we utter; for\nStrawson, sentences are meaningful in and of themselves, independently\nof the utterance situation. Utterances of meaningful sentences may be\ntrue or false or, if here is a presupposition failure, they may be\nneither.)\n\nFor his part, Russell (1957) argued that, despite Strawson\u2019s\nprotestations, the sentence was in fact false:\n\nSuppose, for example, that in some country there was a law that no\nperson could hold public office if he considered it false that the\nRuler of the Universe is wise. I think an avowed atheist who took\nadvantage of Mr. Strawson\u2019s doctrine to say that he did not hold\nthis proposition false would be regarded as a somewhat shifty\ncharacter.\n\n\nDoes this whole debate come down to a case of intuition swapping?\nThomason (1990; 327) and Soames (1976; 169) seemed to think so, and\nStrawson himself (1964) also came to doubt whether the entailment vs.\npresupposition debate could be settled by \u201cbrisk little formal\nargument[s]\u201d. However, Neale (1990) maintained that the matter\ncould be settled in Russell\u2019s favor, and supported the claim by\ncollecting a number of previously observed cases in which intuitions\nabout truth conditions clearly do not support Strawson\u2019s view.\nFor example, \u2018My mother is dating the present king of\nFrance\u2019 seems clearly false, as does \u2018The present king of\nFrance cleans my swimming pool\u2019, and he concluded that these are\nclearly cases where the Strawsonian truth conditions have gone\nawry.\n\nBut truth value judgments for cases like this are extremely sensitive.\nLasersohn (1993), von Fintel (2004), Yablo (2006, 2009) and Schoubye\n(2009, 2011) have collected a number of examples where subtle changes\nto the example give rise to different judgments of truth value.\nConsider the following minimal pairs, where the examples marked with\n\u2018#\u2019 indicate ambivalence about assigning a truth value,\nand \u2018F\u2019 indicates it is more plausible to assign a value\nof falsehood.\n\n\n\n\n(34)\na.\n# The present king of France is bald. \n\n\u00a0\nb.\nF The present king of France is a bald Nazi. \n\n(35)\na.\n# The present king of France is sitting in a chair. \n\n\u00a0\nb.\nF The present king of France is sitting that chair. \n\n(36)\na.\n# The present king of France read Anna Karenina.\n\n\n\u00a0\nb.\nF The present king of France wrote Anna Karenina.\n\n\n(37)\na.\n# The present king of France heard about Goldbach\u2019s\nconjecture. \n\n\u00a0\nb.\nF The present king of France proved Goldbach\u2019s\nconjecture.  \n\n\n\nVon Fintel and Yablo offer an explanation for these minimal pairs that\ndraws upon the nature of belief revision. Their idea is that the false\npresupposition is added to the evaluator\u2019s set of beliefs and is\ntested against that set of beliefs. So, if we test \u2018The king of\nFrance read Anna Karenina\u2019 against a typical set of beliefs,\nthere is no clash with existing beliefs. But if we test \u2018The\nking of France wrote Anna Karenina\u2019 against this set of\nbeliefs, we get a clash. These are the cases where we judge the\nsentence false.\n\nSchoubye (2009, 2011) has argued that the von Fintel/Yablo story fails\nin key places, in particular with cases where there is no previously\nexisting conflicting belief. We typically believe that Anna\nKarenina was written by Tolstoy, who was not and is not the king\nof France, but do we really have a belief in which the king of France\nwas not a bald Nazi? Where would that belief come from? A general\nbelief that royals can\u2019t be Nazis? That seems implausible.\n\nMore significantly, Schoubye observes that with some modest contextual\nframing the truth value judgments on these examples can flip. In other\nwords, we don\u2019t even need to change the example sentences.\nSuppose, for example, that someone says that all the royalty at a\nparty are standing and someone utters \u2018The present king of\nFrance is sitting in a chair\u2019. Here Schoubye suggests that our\ntruth value judgments firm up and flip from being indeterminate to\nbeing clear judgments of falsity.\n\nSchoubye\u2019s positive proposal is that the divergent judgments\nabout truth conditions key off of whether a speaker\u2019s utterance\ncan be interpreted as being cooperative. Here Schoubye draws on\nRobert\u2019s (1998, 2004) idea of the \u201ctopic under\ndiscussion.\u201d In the example just given, where we are talking\nabout who is sitting at a particular party, someone who utters (35a)\nis being an uncooperative discourse partner, in that they are not\naddressing the topic under discussion.\n\nThe literature on presuppositional accounts of definite descriptions\nhas become vast, although not entirely uniform in its criticism of\nRussellian doctrine. Earlier, we noted that on Russell\u2019s view\ndefinite descriptions pack within them an existence claim, a\nuniqueness claim, and a maximality claim. Different presuppositional\naccounts have targeted different parts of this package, arguing that\nthe relevant component is not entailed but is presupposed.\n\nFor example, beginning with Strawson and the work cited above, we have\nnumerous writers arguing that the existence claim is presupposed. The\nidea that uniqueness is presupposed is suggested in work by Heim\n(1991), von Fintel (2004), Elbourne (2005, 2013), Rothschild (2007),\nand Schoubye (2013). It is possible to understand Cooper (1983), Heim\n(1983), Chemla (2009), Schlenker (2008, 2009) and Romoli (2015) as\nholding that the maximality component is presupposed. Combinations are\npossible. The idea that both the existence claim and the uniqueness\nclaim is presupposed can be attributed to Abbott (2008), Hawthorne and\nManley (2012) and Schoubye (2013), among others.\u00a0 For a detailed\ndefense of the Strawsonian position, see Elbourne (2013).\n",
