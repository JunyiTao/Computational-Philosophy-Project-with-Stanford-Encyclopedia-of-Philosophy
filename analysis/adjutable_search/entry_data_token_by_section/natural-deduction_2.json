    "main_text": "Natural Deduction Systems || Gentzen and Ja\u015bkowski\n2.1 Gentzen and Ja\u015bkowski\n\nGentzen\u2019s method for natural deduction\u2014his \\(\\mathcal{N}\\)\ncalculi\u2014were given in a tree format with occurrences of formulas\nappearing as nodes of the tree. The root of the tree is the formula to\nbe proved, and the \u201csuppositions\u201d are at the leaves of the\ntree. The following is such a proof tree for the theorem\n\n\\[(((p\\rightarrow q) \\land (\\neg r\\rightarrow \\neg q))\\rightarrow(p\\rightarrow r))\\]\n\n\nin Gentzen\u2019s \\(\\mathcal{N}\\) calculus. (As an aid in following\nthis proof, it should be mentioned that Gentzen\u2019s main rule for\nindirect proofs first generated \\(\\bot\\) (\u201cthe absurd\nproposition\u201d) from the two parts of a contradiction, and then\ngenerated the negation of the relevant\n assumption.[5]\n\n\n\nFigure 1: Gentzen style proof. [An\n extended description of figure 1\n is in the supplement.]\n\n\nThe lines indicate a transition from the upper formula(s) to the one\njust beneath the line, using the rule of inference indicated on the\nright edge of the line. (We might replace these horizontal lines with\nvertical or splitting lines to more clearly indicate tree-branches,\nand label these branches with the rule of inference responsible, and\nthe result would look even more tree-like). Gentzen uses the numerals\non the leaves as a way to keep track of subproofs. Here the antecedent\nof the conditional to be proved is entered (twice, since there are two\nseparate things to do with it) with the numeral \u20181\u2019, the\nantecedent of the consequent of the main theorem is entered with\nnumeral \u20182\u2019, and the formula \\(\\neg r\\) (to be used in the\nreductio part of the proof) is entered with numeral \u20183\u2019.\nWhen the relevant \u201cscope changing\u201d rule is applied\n(indicated by citing the numeral of that branch as part of the\ncitation of the rule of inference, in parentheses) this numeral gets\ncrossed out, indicating that this subproof is finished.\n\nCompletely independent from Gentzen, Ja\u015bkowski (1934) described\ntwo methods. Of interest to us in this article is the one found in a\nlengthy footnote, where he describes a pictorial method that he had\nannounced\n earlier.[6]\n The pictorial method involved the drawing of \u201cboxes\u201d\naround portions of a proof, to indicate that the enclosed formulas are\n\u201cconsidered as following only under a\nsupposition\u201d\u2014or as we might say, they are a subproof that\nfollows from an assumed\n premise.[7]\n\n\n\nFigure 2: Ja\u015bkowski style proof.\n[An\n extended description of figure 2\n is in the supplement.]\n\n\nThe fundamental notion of making a supposition (= assumption) and\nseeing where it leads is indicated in Ja\u015bkowski\u2019s by the\nintroduction of a box, the first line of which is the supposition and\nall the consequences of that assumption are retained inside that box.\nMoreover, further suppositions can be made within the\nprevious box by generating a subordinate box. The fundamental rule of\nConditionalization is that a conditional whose antecedent is the\nsupposition and whose consequent is the final line inside the box can\nbe entered as the next line outside the box. Once a box has\nbeen constructed, no formula within it can be used to justify any line\nof the proof outside of the box. A similar rule of supposition is the\nReductio, or Negation Introduction, rule, where two\ncontradictory lines inside the same box can trigger a completion\n(closing) of the box and the unnegated supposition as the next line\noutside the box. A theorem of the language is a formula that can be\ngenerated by these rules and is outside of all boxes. As with\nthe Gentzen proof, we see that Ja\u015bkowski\u2019s use of the rule\nReductio ad Absurdum deletes a negation sign from the\nassumption. This is Ja\u015bkowski\u2019s way to move from\nintuitionistic logic to classical logic. (Again, see\n note 23\n for methods of strengthening intuitionistic logic to classical\nlogic.)\n",
