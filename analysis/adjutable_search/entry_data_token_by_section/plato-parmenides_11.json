The Deductions 137c\u2013166c\n\n\nEach Deduction consists of separate stretches of reasoning (call\nthem \u201cArguments\u201d) leading to a number of logically\ninterconnected results (call them \u201cConclusions\u201d). The\nsummary to follow is governed by the following notational\nconventions. Each Deduction receives a number (\u201cD1\u201d\nfor the first Deduction, \u201cD2\u201d for the second Deduction, and\nso on) and each Argument within each Deduction receives a number\n(\u201cA1\u201d for the first Argument, \u201cA2\u201d for the\nsecond Argument, and so on). (The Appendix to the first two\nDeductions will be called \u201cApp\u201d.) If an Argument has\nexactly one Conclusion, the single Conclusion will be referred to as\n\u201cC\u201d. If an Argument has more than one Conclusion, the\nConclusions will be numbered (\u201cC1\u201d for the first\nConclusion, \u201cC2\u201d for the second Conclusion, and so\non).\n",
