    "main_text": "\n\nThere is unanimous agreement that N\u0101g\u0101rjuna (ca\n150\u2013250 CE) is the most important Buddhist philosopher after the\nhistorical Buddha himself and one of the most original and influential\nthinkers in the history of Indian philosophy. His philosophy of the\n\u201cmiddle way\u201d (madhyamaka) based around the\ncentral notion of \u201cemptiness\u201d\n(\u015b\u016bnyat\u0101) influenced the Indian philosophical\ndebate for a thousand years after his death; with the spread of\nBuddhism to Tibet, China, Japan and other Asian countries the writings\nof N\u0101g\u0101rjuna became an indispensable point of reference for\ntheir own philosophical inquiries. A specific reading of\nN\u0101g\u0101rjuna\u2019s thought, called\nPr\u0101sa\u1e45gika-Madhyamaka, became the official\nphilosophical position of Tibetan Buddhism which regards it as the\npinnacle of philosophical sophistication up to the present day.\n",
