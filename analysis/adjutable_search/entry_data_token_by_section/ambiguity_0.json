    "main_text": "Introduction\n1. Introduction\n\nAmbiguity is generally taken to be a property enjoyed by signs that\nbear multiple (legitimate) interpretations in a language or, more\ngenerally, some system of signs.  \u2019legitimate\u2019 is a cover\nterm I\u2019m using to nod to the fact that many signs can, in principle,\nbear just about any interpretation.  The relativization is to\nprevent ambiguity in terms like like \u2018leaped\u2019\nwhich means leaped in English but loved in German.  In\ncommon parlance, the word \u2018ambiguity\u2019 is used loosely:\noften simple underspecificity will suffice for a charge of ambiguity.\nThe U.S.\u2019s policy towards the unification of China and Taiwan\nhas been described as a policy of \u2018strategic ambiguity\u2019,\none that allows the U.S. to be non-specific with respect to the status\nof Taiwan. \u2018Jane\u2019s sister will come to visit\u2019 is\nsometimes thought to be ambiguous when Jane has multiple sisters. A\nmovie with a character that heads to surgery at the end, leaving it\nopen whether he lives or dies, is said to have an ambiguous ending.\nThere is a medical condition known as \u2018ambiguous\ngenitalia\u2019 in which the genitals don\u2019t categorize clearly, or\nexclusively, into male or female genitalia.\n\nIn many domains, however, theorists have found it useful to divide the\nphenomenon of ambiguity from other phenomena (e.g.,\nunderspecification, vagueness, context sensitivity). Ambiguity is of\ninterest to philosophers for a variety of reasons, some of which we\nwill look at below. First, ambiguity makes vivid some of the\ndifferences between formal languages and natural languages and\npresents demands on the usage of the former to provide\nrepresentations of the latter. Second, ambiguity can have a\ndeleterious effect on our ability to determine the validity of\narguments in natural language on account of possible equivocation.\nThird, ambiguity in art can intentionally (or unintentionally)\nincrease the interest in a work of art by refusing to allow easy\ncategorization and interpretation. Fourth, ambiguity in the statement\nof the law can undermine their applicability and our ability to\nobey them. Finally, ambiguity resolution is an important feature of our\ncognitive understanding and interpretative abilities. Studying\nambiguity and how we resolve it in practice can give us insight into both thought\nand interpretation.\n\nAmbiguity has excited philosophers for a very, very long time. It was\nstudied in the context of the study of fallacies in Aristotle\u2019s\nSophistical Refutations. Aristotle identifies various\nfallacies associated with ambiguity and\n amphiboly[1]\n writing:\n\n\nThere are three varieties of these ambiguities and amphibolies: (1)\nWhen either the expression or the name has strictly more than one\nmeaning\u2026 (2) when by custom we use them so; (3) when words that\nhave a simple sense taken alone have more than one meaning in\ncombination; e.g. \u2018knowing letters\u2019. For each word, both\n\u2018knowing\u2019 and \u2018letters\u2019, possibly has a single\nmeaning: but both together have more than one-either that the letters\nthemselves have knowledge or that someone else has it of them.\n(Sophistical Refutations bk. 4)\n\n\nThe stoics were also intrigued by ambiguity (see Atherton 1993).\nChrysippus claimed at one point that every word is\nambiguous \u2013 though by this he meant that the same person may\nunderstand a word spoken to him in many distinct ways. Philosophers\nconcerned with the relation between language and thought, particularly\nthose who argue for a language of thought, concerned\nthemselves with whether the language in which we think could contain\nambiguous phrases. Ockham, for example, was willing to countenance\nambiguities in mental sentences of a language of thought but not\nmental terms in that language (see Spade p. 101). Frege contemplated\nnon-overlap of sense in natural language in a famous footnote,\nwriting:\n\n\n\u2026So long as the reference remains the same, such variations of\nsense may be tolerated, although they are to be avoided in the\ntheoretical structure of a demonstrative science and ought not to\noccur in a perfect language. (Frege 1948 [1892], p. 210 fn. 2)\n\n\nFrege\u2019s hostility to ambiguity remains with\nus today. Frequently we use formal languages precisely so that we can\ndisambiguate otherwise ambiguous sentences (brackets being a paradigm\nexample of a disambiguating device).\n\nGiving an account of ambiguity (and disambiguation) requires one to\ndiscern the bearer(s) of ambiguity. Propositions, for example, are\npresumably unambiguous (since they are meanings they can\u2019t be\nsubject to further considerations of meaning). This leaves a range of\npotential objects: utterances, utterances relative to a context,\nsentences, sentences relative to a context, discourses,\ninscriptions\u2026. The differences aren\u2019t trivial: a written\ndown sentence corresponds to many possible ways of being uttered in\nwhich features such as prosody can prevent certain meanings that the\nwritten down sentence seems capable of enjoying. Two written\nutterances may sound the same (if they contain words that sound alike)\nwithout being spelt alike (if the words aren\u2019t co-spelled) thus\nresulting in phonological ambiguity without corresponding orthographic\nambiguity.  I\u2019m going to (somewhat perversely) simply use\n\u2018sentence\u2019 and \u2018phrase\u2019 ambiguously, and I\nwill attempt to disambiguate when necessary. We will also look briefly\nat the application of ambiguity to discourse transitions. \n\nOne important question regarding ambiguity is how we ought to\nrepresent ambiguities. With structural ambiguities there is no\nindependent issue but with lexical ambiguities there is a real issue.\nIt\u2019s tempting to see this as a question we could answer in any\nnumber of equally good ways. For example, we may choose to represent\nthe meaning of \u2018bank\u2019 disjunctively or we may choose to\nindividuate \u2018bank\u2019 as multiple lexical items that simply\nsound and look alike, perhaps using subscripts. Both are potentially\nproblematic if taken as analyses: disjunctive meanings are not unique\nto ambiguity (I can introduce any term I like with a single\ndisjunctive meaning), and representation using subscripts simply masks\nthe question of what the subscripts represent. This suggests that the\nissue is more like a problem than a nuisance or a trivial choice and\nactually has serious ramifications for how to pursue truth conditional\nsemantics. (See Davidson 1967, Gillon 1990, and Saka 2007 (Ch. 6) for\nan interesting account of the problem regarding representing\nambiguity.) I\u2019ll proceed as though lexical ambiguities are properly\nrepresented as two separate words/lexical items that overlap with\nrespect to some significant feature (phonologically, graphemically,\npictorially\u2026).\n\nA brief terminological point: \u2018polysemy\u2019 refers to a\nphenomenon that is closely related to ambiguity, but often is\ncharacterized as a term with multiple meanings that are, in some hard\nto specify sense, interestingly related. For example, \u2018in\u2019\nis often thought to be a paradigm of polysemy: to be in a car, in my\nthoughts and in trouble seem to play on notions of containment but\nthere is clearly a difference in how we interpret \u2018in\u2019 in\neach case. It is sometimes characterized as a phenomenon subsumable\nunder ambiguity (basically, an ambiguity with the meanings that are\ntightly related meanings) but sometimes it is taken to be a different\nphenomenon altogether. One traditional carving is that ambiguity in\nwords is a matter of two or more lexical entries that correspond to\nthe same word and polysemy a single lexeme that has multiple\nmeanings.[2] For\nthe rest of this article, I will assume that polysemy is simply\nambiguity with tightly corresponding meanings and I will not try to\ndistinguish polysemy from ambiguity very carefully.  Many cognitive\nlinguists contend that there there is no principled way to divide\nthese in any case. It\u2019s worth noticing that terms could be both\nambiguous and polysemous if it had three meanings, two of which were\nsuitably related and one which was quite far apart from the other\ntwo. See Vicente and Falkum (2017) for a detailed look at\npolysemy.  \n",
