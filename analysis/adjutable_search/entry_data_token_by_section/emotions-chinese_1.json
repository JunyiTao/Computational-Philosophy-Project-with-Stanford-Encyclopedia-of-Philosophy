    "main_text": "Emotions, Affective Sensitivity, and Chinese Philosophy || Emotions in Chinese Philosophy\n1.2 Emotions in Chinese Philosophy\n\nIn Chinese philosophy, however, emotions are not necessarily or fully\nunderstood as subjective feelings. Nor is it characterized as an\nirrational or excessive urge of passion that disrupts or challenges\nrational thinking. Instead, emotions play broad psychological and\nmoral roles in the cultivation of virtue and the political order and\nstability of society. From this unique Chinese perspective, one can\nunderstand that one\u2019s affective interaction with the personal,\nsocial, and physical environments constitutes one\u2019s moral agency\nand an essential property of the interdependent and communal self. For\nexample, Confucius states that the duty of serving one\u2019s parents\n(filial piety) has no meaning if one does not have genuine affection\ntoward one\u2019s parents (Analects, 2.7) and ritual\npropriety becomes a blind rule following behavior if one does not have\ncaring heart for others (Analects, 3.3). Mozi (Mozi,\n13.1) states that a ruler cannot govern his or her state successfully\nwithout understanding the affective dispositions and circumstances of\npeople. That is, emotions are not simply inner subjective feelings but\ninteractive, perceptual, cognitive, motivational, and affective states\nof the mind in their constant dealings with the world that in itself\nis affectively constituted and embedded. As Vir\u00e1g (2017: 194)\nstates, emotions in early Chinese philosophy \u201cdid not simply\nrepresent the individual realm of subjective experience\u201d but\nconstitute \u201cthe crucial interface between self and the world,\nmind and cosmos\u201d. Cheng (2001: 79) captures this holistic and\ninteractive viewpoint with a broad notion of the mind in Chinese\nphilosophy. \n\n\nMind is not simply an intellectual entity or a mechanism for thinking\nor reasoning. It is rather an inter-linked entity of sensibility,\nfeeling, awareness, thinking and willing as testified by common\nexperience of reflective subjectivity of the self-identified as the\n\u201cI\u201d. \n\n\nTherefore, emotions, in Chinese philosophy, are understood as the\nholistic affectivity of the sensing, thinking, and feeling mind that\nis always related to and interactive with the world.\n",
