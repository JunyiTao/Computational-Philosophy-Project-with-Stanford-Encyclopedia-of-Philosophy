It was due to Avicenna that the\nprimum cognitum, the first object of knowledge became a\ncentral topic of medieval Latin metaphysics. The question of the\nprimum cognitum was variously answered. For Guibert of\nTournai, Bonaventure and Henry of Ghent, God is the primum\ncognitum (Goris 1999), for Thomas Aquinas and Duns Scotus being\n(ens), for Berthold of Moosburg the good (bonum). An\nexample of a primum cognitum theory influenced by Avicenna is\nThomas Aquinas\u2019. There cannot be an infinite regress, neither in\nthe order of demonstration, nor in the order of definition, Thomas\nargues. This is why there is a first concept: \u201cbeing\u201d. It\nis what is first grasped by the mind, and it is unrestrictedly\nuniversal. It is specific for Thomas, however, that the order of\ndefinition and of demonstration are not on the same level. The\nprinciple of contradiction rests (fundatur) on a conceptual\nbasis, since it can be reduced to the terms out of which it is\ncomposed, among which \u201cbeing\u201d is the first (In\nMetaph. IV.6; Aertsen 1996, 146\u2013151).\n\nAvicenna\u2019s theory of primary concepts was an important source\nfor the theory of transcendental concepts, which scholastic\nphilosophers developed in the thirteenth century, taking their cue\nfrom Aristotle, Avicenna and the Dionysian tradition (Aertsen 2008;\nAertsen 2012; Pini 2012). Avicenna bequeathed to the discussion of the\ntranscendentals not only specific teachings about the notions\n\u201cbeing\u201d, \u201cone\u201d and \u201cthing\u201d, but\nalso the general idea that, ontologically, the primary concepts are\nmost common since they are true of everything, and that,\nepistemologically, they are first known since they are self-evident\nand not reducable to prior concepts.\n",
