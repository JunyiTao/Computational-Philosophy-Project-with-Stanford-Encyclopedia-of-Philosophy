    "main_text": "Does altruism exist? || Psychological egoism: strong and weak versions\n2.1 Psychological egoism: strong and weak versions\n\nAccording to a doctrine called \u201cpsychological egoism\u201d, all\nhuman action is ultimately motivated by self-interest. The\npsychological egoist can agree with the idea, endorsed by common\nsense, that we often seek to benefit others besides ourselves; but he\nsays that when we do so, that is because we regard helping others as a\nmere means to our own good. According to the psychological egoist, we\ndo not care about others for their sake. Altruism, in other words,\ndoes not exist.\n\nSince we have distinguished several different ways of using the term\n\u201caltruism\u201d, it will be helpful to make similar\ndistinctions between different varieties of psychological egoism.\nRecall that an act is altruistic in the weak sense if it is motivated,\nat least in part, by the fact that it benefits someone else (or the\nfact that it will not injure anyone else). Psychological egoism, as\ndefined in the preceding paragraph, denies that altruism in this sense\nexists. That is the strongest form of this doctrine; it is usually\nwhat philosophers have in mind when they discuss psychological egoism.\nBut we can imagine weaker versions. One of them would deny that\naltruism is ever pure; it would say, in other words, that whenever we\nact, one of our motives is a desire for our own good. Another\nweaker form of psychological egoism would hold that we never\nvoluntarily do what we foresee will sacrifice our well-being to some\nextent. This third form of psychological egoism would admit that\nsometimes one of our reasons for acting is the good we do for others\nfor their sake; but it claims that we never act for the good of others\nwhen we think that doing so would make us worse off.\n",
