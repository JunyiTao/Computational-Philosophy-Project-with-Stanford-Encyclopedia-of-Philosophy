Industry Sponsored Research\n\nThe fundamental ethical challenge posed by clinical research is\nwhether it is acceptable to expose some to research risks for the\nbenefit of others. In the standard formulation, the one we have been\nconsidering to this point, the benefits that others enjoy as the\nresult of participants\u2019 participation in clinical research are\nmedical and health benefits, better treatments for disease, better\nmethods to prevent disease.\n\nIndustry funded research introduces the potential for a very different\nsort of benefit and thereby potentially alters, in a fundamental way,\nthe moral concerns raised by clinical research. Pharmaceutical\ncompanies typically focus on generating profit and increasing stock\nprice and market share. Indeed, it is sometimes argued that\ncorporations have an obligation to their shareholders to pursue\nincreased market share and share price (Friedman 1970). This approach\nmay well lead companies to pursue new medical treatments which have\nlittle or no potential to improve overall health and well-being\n(Huskamp 2006; Croghan and Pittman 2004). \u201cMe-too\u201d drugs\nare the classic example here. These are drugs identical in all\nclinically relevant respects to approved drugs already in use. The\ndevelopment of a me-too drug offers the potential to redistribute\nmarket share without increasing overall health and well-being.\n\nThere is considerable debate regarding how many me-too drugs there\nreally are and what is required for a drug to qualify as effectively\nidentical (Garattini 1997). For example, if the existing treatment\nneeds to be taken with meals, but a new treatment need not, is that a\nclinically relevant advance? Bracketing these questions, a drug\ncompany may well be interested in a drug which clearly qualifies as a\nme-too drug. The company may be able, by relying on a savvy marketing\ndepartment, to convince physicians to prescribe, and consumers to\nrequest the new one, thus increasing profit for the company without\nadvancing health and well-being.\n\nThe majority of clinical research was once conducted by governmental\nagencies. For example, the US NIH is likely the largest governmental\nsponsor of clinical research in the world. However, its research\nbudget has declined over the past 20 years (Mervis 2004, 2008), and it\nis estimated that a majority, perhaps a significant majority of\nclinical research studies are now conducted by industry: \u201cas\nrecently as 1991 eighty per cent of industry-sponsored trials were\nconducted in academic health centers\u2026Impatient with the slow\npace of academic bureaucracies, pharmaceutical companies have moved\ntrials to the private sector, where more than seventy per cent of them\nare now conducted\u201d (Elliott 2008, Angell 2008, Miller and Brody\n2005).\n\nIn addition to transforming the fundamental ethical challenge posed by\nclinical research, industry sponsored research has the potential to\ntransform the way that many of the specific ethical concerns are\naddressed within that context. For example, the possibility that\ninvestigators and funders may earn significant amounts of money from\ntheir participation in clinical research might, it is thought, warp\ntheir judgment in ways that conflict with appropriate protection of\nresearch participants (Fontanarosa, Flanagin, and DeAngelis 2005).\nWhen applied to investigators and funders this concern calls into\nquestion the very significant percentage of research funded by and\noften conducted by for-profit organizations. Skeptics might wonder\nwhether the goal of making money has any greater potential to\ninfluence judgment inappropriately compared to many other motivations\nthat are widely accepted, even esteemed in the context of clinical\nresearch, such as gaining tenure and fame, impressing one\u2019s\ncolleagues, or winning the Nobel Prize.\n\nFinancial conflicts of interest in clinical research point to a\ntension between relying on profits to motivate research versus\ninsulating drug development and testing from the profit motive as a\nway of protecting research participants and future patients (Psaty and\nKronmal 2008). Finally, if a company can make billions of dollars a\nyear from a single drug, one wonders what constitutes an appropriate\nresponse to the participants who were vital to its development. On a\nstandard definition, whether a given transaction is fair depends on\nthe risks and burdens that each party to the transaction bears and the\nextent to which others benefit from the party\u2019s participation in\nthe transaction (see entry on\n exploitation).\n A series of clinical research studies can result in a company earning\ntens of billions of dollars in profits. Recognizing that a fair level\nof benefit is a complex function of participants\u2019 inputs\ncompared to the inputs of others, and the extent to which third\nparties benefit from those inputs, it is difficult to see how one\nmight fill in the details of this scenario to show that the typically\nminimal, or non-existent compensation offered to research participants\nis fair.\n\nAt the same time, addressing this potential for exploitation by\noffering substantial payments to research participants who contribute\nto especially lucrative studies would introduce its own set of ethical\nconcerns: is payment an appropriate response to the kind of\ncontribution made by research participants; might payment constitute\nan undue inducement to participate; will payment undermine other\nparticipants\u2019 altruistic motivations; to what extent does\npayment encourage research participants to provide misleading or false\ninformation to investigators in order to enroll and remain in research\nstudies?\n",
