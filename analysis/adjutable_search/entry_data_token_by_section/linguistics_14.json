A psychogrammar, to the extent that it corresponds to a\ngenerative grammar, might be thought to equip a speaker to know (at\nleast in principle) absolutely whether a string is in the language.\nHowever, elicited metalinguistic judgments are uncontroversially a\nmatter of degree. A question arises concerning the scale on which\nthese degrees of acceptability should be measured.\n\nLinguists have implicitly worked with a scale of roughly half a dozen\nlevels and types of acceptability, annotating them with prefixed\nsymbols. The most familiar is the asterisk, originally used simply to\nmark strings of words as ungrammatical, i.e., as not belonging to the\nlanguage at all. Other prefixed marks have gradually become\ncurrent:\n\n\n\nprefix\napproximate meaning \n\n#\nsemantically anomalous: unacceptable in virtue of a bizarre\nmeaning \n\n%\nsubject to a \u2018dialect\u2019 split: judged grammatical\nonly by some speakers  \n\n\nBut other annotations have been used to indicate a gradation in the\nextent to which some sentences are unacceptable. No scientifically\nvalidated or explicitly agreed meanings have been associated with\nthese marks, but a tradition has slowly grown up of assigning prefixes\nsuch as those in Table 2 to signify degrees of unacceptability:\n\n\n\n\nprefix\napproximate meaning \n\n(no prefix)\nacceptable and thus presumably grammatical \n\n?\nof dubious acceptability, though probably grammatical \n\n??\nclearly unacceptable but possibly grammatical \n\n?*\nunacceptable enough to suggest probable ungrammaticality\n\n\n*\nunacceptable enough to suggest clear ungrammaticality \n\n**\ngrossly unacceptable, suggesting extreme ungrammaticality\n \n\n\nTable 2: Prefixes used to mark levels of\nacceptability\n\n\nSuch markings are often used in a way that suggests an ordinal\nscale, i.e. a partial ordering that is silent on anything\nother than equivalence in acceptability or ranking in degree of\nunacceptability.\n\nBy contrast, Bard et al. (1996: 39) point out, it is possible to use\ninterval scales, which additionally measure distance\nbetween ordinal positions. Interval scales of acceptability would\nmeasure relative distances between strings\u2014how much\nmore or less acceptable one is than another. Magnitude\nestimation is a method developed in psychophysics to measure\nsubjects\u2019 judgments of physical stimuli on an interval scale.\nBard et al. (1996) adapted these methods to linguistic acceptability\njudgments, arguing that interval scales of measurement are required\nfor testing theoretical claims that rely on subtle judgments of\ncomparative acceptability. An ordinal scale of acceptability can\nrepresent one expression as being less acceptable than another, but\ncannot support quantitative questions about how much less. Many\ngenerative Essentialist theorists had been suggesting that violation\nof different universal principles led to different degrees of\nunacceptability. According to Bard et al. (34\u201335), because there\nmay be \u201cdisproportion between the fineness of judgments people\ncan make and the symbol set available for recording them\u201d it\nwill not suffice to use some fixed scale such as this one:\n\n? < ?? < ?* < * < **\n\nindicating absolute degrees of unacceptability. Degrees of relative\nunacceptability must be measured. This is done by asking the informant\nhow much less acceptable one string is than another.\n\nMagnitude estimation can be used with both informal and experimental\nmethods of data collection. And data that is measured using interval\nscales can be subjected to much more mathematically sophisticated\ntests and analyses than data measured solely by an ordinal scale,\nprovided that quantitative data are available.\n\nIt should be noted that the value of applying magnitude estimation to\nthe judgment of acceptability has been directly challenged in two\nrecent papers. Weskott and Fanselow (2011) and Sprouse (2011) both\npresent critiques of Bard et al. (1996). Weskott and Fanselow compared\nmagnitude estimation data to standard judgments on binary and 7-point\nscales, and claim that magnitude estimation does not yield more\ninformation than other judgment tasks, and moreover can produce\nspurious variance. And Sprouse, on the basis of recent formalizations\nof magnitude estimation in the psychophysics literature, presents\nexperimental evidence that participants cannot make ratio judgments of\nacceptability (for example, a judgment that one sentence is precisely\nhalf as acceptable as another), which suggests that the magnitude\nestimation task probably provides the same interval-level data as\nother judgment tasks.\n",
