    "main_text": "International Law as Law || Lack of Centralized Enforcement Mechanisms\n2.1 Lack of Centralized Enforcement Mechanisms\n\nAt the domestic level, law is enforced through both executive power\n(police, tax authorities, regulatory bodies, etc) and judicial power.\nInternational law does not benefit from a comprehensive system of\nexecutive and judicial enforcement that is comparable to what\ndeveloped domestic legal systems can offer. The UN, as the principal\ninternational organization, does perform a unique role particularly in\nthe area of collective peace and security; and its most powerful\norgan, the Security Council, is empowered to adopt decisions under\nChapter VII of the UN Charter that are binding on all member states of\nthe UN and can involve the use of military force. The Security Council\nhas used its enforcement powers since the end of the Cold War, most\nnotably during the First Gulf War in 1990\u20131991 when it\nauthorized its member States to use force to liberate Kuwait following\nIraq\u2019s aggression and invasion. But there are many examples of\ngrave breaches of international law that are not met with any\nenforcement action by the Security Council. As for judicial\nenforcement, international law lacks a centralized dispute settlement\nmechanism that operates independently of the consent of states. It is\ntrue, however, that the role of the International Court of Justice and\nthe proliferation of other international courts and\ntribunals\u2014with jurisdiction over areas such as human rights,\ntrade, investment, international crimes\u2014mean that, in practice,\ninternational law does benefit today from a far greater measure of\nenforcement through courts and tribunals than ever in the past.\n\nSome legal philosophers have responded to the problem of limited\nenforcement by fashioning a theory of international law on the basis\nof the hypothesis\u2014admitted to be a\n\u201cfantasy\u201d\u2014that an international court with\ncompulsory jurisdiction exists and that there are reliable\ninternational institutional mechanisms for giving effect to its\ndecisions (Dworkin 2013;\n section 4.4 below).\n Some have also given a normative interpretation of the relation\nbetween law and enforceability that makes in principle, rather than\nactual, enforceability a touchstone of legality. Thus, according to\nLiam Murphy, when it comes to law\n\n\nwe would regard it as obviously appropriate for provision to be made\nwithin the normative order itself for effective enforcement. Properly\nregulated third-party enforcement is always in principle appropriate.\n(Murphy 2017: 221).\n\n\nAnother solution draws attention to the existence of decentralized\nmodes of enforcement, e.g., \u201coutcasting\u201d, which operate\nnot through centralized institutions, but by denying law-breakers the\nbenefits of membership and cooperation (Hathaway & Shapiro 2011;\nKelsen 1952 [2012: 20\u201325]; Goodman & Jinks, 2013). Finally,\nand more radically, some reject the thesis that enforcement\nmechanisms, centralized or not, are necessary for full-fledged legal\nstatus. It is a mainstream view in contemporary legal philosophy,\nshared by philosophers as diverse as H.L.A. Hart, John Finnis, and\nJoseph Raz, that the concept of law does not involve the idea of\ncoercion as a necessary element (Hart 1961 [2012: 199\u2013200];\nFinnis 2011; Raz 1999: 159; and in relation to international law,\nO\u2019Connell 2008: 62\u20138. For a different view, see Schauer\n2015).\n\nThis mainstream view rejects the command theory of law (e.g., John\nAustin), which construes law as orders of a sovereign backed by the\nthreat of sanctions; the view that the function of law is to identify\ndelicts (conduct characterized as illegal) which are the condition of\na sanction (a coercive act against the law-breaker) (e.g., Kelsen); as\nwell as predictive theories of law (e.g., Oliver Wendell Holmes) which\nreduce law to predictions about the application of sanctions (Hart\n1961 [2012]). Instead, the primary function of law is to provide a\nstructure for generating norms that guide human behaviour, with or\nwithout the existence of effective sanctions, as in Joseph Raz\u2019s\nhypothetical \u201csociety of angels\u201d (Raz 1999: 159). On this\nview, enforcement mechanisms operate as a mere contingent back-up plan\nfor cases where law fails in its primary function.\n\nAs a matter of historical fact, municipal legal systems have\nextensively relied on centralized enforcement mechanisms to encourage\ncompliance, but this does not amount to a conceptual constraint on the\nexistence of law. It is also worth noting Hart\u2019s observation\nthat in the international domain\u2014where it is difficult for\nviolence and wrong-doing to remain hidden from public view\u2014there\nmay be less of a practical need for sanctions to secure compliance\n(Hart 1961 [2012: 218]).\n\nOn this view, what matters for the existence of international law is a\nsufficient level of compliance to underwrite its operation as a\npractically effective system of normative ordering. Though some query\nwhether international legal norms genuinely exert compliance pull of\ntheir own accord, as opposed to on the basis of independent (e.g.,\nself-interested) reasons that favour adopting the pattern of behaviour\nprescribed by law (Goldsmith & Posner 2005), in the famous words\nof Louis Henkin, it is arguably still the case that\n\n\nalmost all nations observe almost all principles of international law\nand almost all of their obligations almost all the time. (Henkin 1979:\n47)\n\n",
