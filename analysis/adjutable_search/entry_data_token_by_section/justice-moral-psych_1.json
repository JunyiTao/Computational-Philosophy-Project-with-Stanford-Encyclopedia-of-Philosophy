    "main_text": "Dictator Games and Fairness\n2. Dictator Games and Fairness\nIt turns out that this trend is not specific to ultimatum\ngames\u2014research on dictator games went through the same\nevolution. We said that ultimatum games are relatively simple two\nperson games with an offerer and a responder. In the standard dictator\nsetup, things are even simpler. Call the two people involved the\n\u201cdictator\u201d and the \u201crecipient\u201d, Using our $10\nexample, the dictator is told that she can give any amount between $0\nand $10, inclusive, to another person. And whatever the dictator\ndecides, that is the end of the story. So if the dictator wants to\nkeep $8 and give $2 to the recipient, then that is what each person\nwalks away with.\nBeginning with the traditional game-theoretic framework, the\nprediction for what participants serving as dictators would do is\nstraightforward\u2014keep all the money (Forsythe et al. 1994: 348;\nDana et al.  2006: 193). Since there is no threat of rejection by the\nrecipient, and since all that matters is promoting one\u2019s\nself-interest, there is every reason to keep all of the money. Or so\none might think.\nBut once again, that is not what most participants actually did. In\nthe same Forsythe study, while 21% gave nothing to the recipient, the\nremaining 79% gave something, with 21% giving an equal amount of the\n$10 (Forsythe et al. 1994: 362). Kahneman also ran a version of a\ndictator game where students in a psychology course could divide $20\nwith an anonymous fellow student, or keep $18 for themselves and give\n$2 to the other student. Strikingly, 76% choose the even division\n(Kahneman et al. 1986: S291). In addition, 74% of participants were\nsubsequently willing to pay $1 to punish an unfair dictator and in the\nprocess reward a fair one, even though this would reduce their own\nmonetary payment in the process (1986: S291). Van Dijk and\nVermunt (2000) found that information asymmetries were not as\nprevalent as in ultimatum games. Specifically, there wasn\u2019t a\nsignificant effect observed based on whether dictators knew that\nrecipients were aware of the total amount dictators had to\nallocate. As they conclude,\n\n whereas the dictator game evokes a true concern\nfor fairness, allocators in the ultimatum game only appear to behave\nfairly\u2026. (2000: 19; for a review of results in dictator games,\nsee Camerer 2003; Murnighan and Wang 2016)\n\n Overall, according one review of the literature,\ngiving in dictator games amounts to roughly 15\u201320% of what a\nparticipant receives in the first place (Camerer 2003: 57\u201358), which\nis less than fair but more than completely self-interested. As a quick\naside, it is worth noting the implicit assumption in much of this\nliterature that a 50/50 split is the fair distribution, whereas\nkeeping most of the money for oneself would be considered\nunfair. Philosophically this might be a contested matter, and there\ncould also be some variability in terms of which cultures tend to\naccept this assumption more so than others.\nIf the same trend holds that we saw in the previous section, then\nwe know to expect that alternative egoistic stories about motivation\nin dictator games will have emerged as a result of more recent results\nchallenging the fairness motivational hypothesis. Here are two\nexamples of such results:\n\na. In the baseline condition of John List\u2019s study (2007), both\npeople in the dictator game setup were given $5 to start with. Then\nthe dictator received another $5 and was given the chance to allocate\nanywhere from $0 to all $5 to the other person. Three additional\nconditions had interesting twists. In the Take ($1) condition, the\nsetup was the same including the chance to allocate money, but now\ninstead there was an option to take $1 from the other person. The Take\n($5) condition, as its name suggests, allowed up to $5 to be taken\nfrom the other person (or $5 allocated, or nothing taken or\nallocated). Finally, in the Earnings condition, everything was the\nsame as Take ($5) except the dictator earned the $10 for performing a\n30-minute task beforehand. Here were the results (List 2007: 487):\n\n\n\nGiving a Positive Amount\nMean Offer\n\n\nBaseline\n71%\n$1.33\n\n\nTake ($1)\n35%\n$0.33\n\n\nTake ($5)\n10%\n\u2212$2.48\n\n\nEarnings\n6%\n\u2212$1.00\n\n\n\nStrikingly, when given the chance to take money from a stranger,\ndictators would less frequently allocate money to the stranger, and\ntheir average allocation would be smaller. Plus if they felt like they\nearned the money as opposed to just being given it by the\nexperimenter, then almost none of the dictators would be willing to\npart with their money, being more inclined to take rather than to\ngive.\nb. Jason Dana and his colleagues (2006) had dictators make their\nallocation decision using $10. They were told that recipients would be\ninformed about what the dictator knew when making his choice. But\nbefore recipients actually were told anything, dictators were given\nanother choice. They could keep $9 for themselves, $0 would go to the\nrecipient, and crucially, the recipient would not learn anything about\nthe dictator game at all. This exit option would thereby allow dictators to\nkeep a large payoff while also knowing that they had not disappointed\nthe recipient. And the dictator would not have to worry about\nappearing selfish by keeping most of the money (Dana et al. 2006:\n196). Eleven out of 40 dictators (28%) ended up taking this exit option,\nwith 2 of them initially planning to keep the $10 (2006: 197). The\nremaining 9 participants had planned on giving some money to the\nrecipient, and now did not have to.\n28%, while an interesting result, is still not that large. The\nmajority of participants both did not exit and gave some of the $10 to\nthe recipient. However, in a second study, Dana did two things. First\nhe replicated the results of his first study, and this time 43% exited\n(2006: 199). But in a new condition, dictators were told at the very\nbeginning that recipients would be oblivious to the dictator\ngame\u2014they would just receive a note that said, \u201cThank you\nfor your time today. An additional payment of $__ is attached to this\nnote\u201d (2006: 198; Dana did not explain what would happen if the\namount was $0). Thus dictators knew that they could make any offer\nthey wanted to without worrying about how it would be viewed by the\nreceiver. So they chose their allocation, and then were given the $9\nexit option.  And here is the interesting result. Now only 4% of\nparticipants took the exit option, and 54% chose to give $0 and to not\nexit (2006: 199; see also Dana et al. 2007 for additional related\nstudies).\n\nAs with ultimatum games, a diverse array of more sophisticated\negoistic motivational explanations have been proposed to account for\nthe behavior of dictators. Here are examples of a few of them:\n\nA desire to feel good by giving.\nA desire to not appear selfish, or to appear to be fair.\nA desire to give what others expect one to give (or not to\ngive).\n(for an overview, see Dana et al. 2006: 194\u2013195, 200; Dana et al. 2007: 68\u201369, 78)\n\nFor what it\u2019s worth, my view is that it is unlikely any one\nof the proposed motives in the ultimatum and dictator literatures is\ngoing to be sufficient by itself to explain the observed patterns of\nbehavior. Nor, to be fair, are they usually intended by researchers to\nbe sufficient either. Rather, motives concerned with good (monetary)\noutcomes for the self are no doubt part of the story. But so too are\nmotives concerned with fairness. And so too are one or more additional\negoistic motives, such as not wanting to appear selfish. A complex,\nmulti-motive model is what is needed going forward (see also Forsythe\net al. 1994: 362; Roth 1995; G\u00fcth 1995; Kagel et al. 1996: 102;\nPillutla and Murnighan 2003: 254; Dana et al. 2006: 195; Dana et al. 2007: 78; Murnighan and Wang 2016: 87).\nLet me end with a cautious note. Recently there have been some doubts raised about the external validity of dictator games, or the extent to which the results generated in these lab studies carry over to non-artificial or natural settings. For instance, Jeffrey Winking and Nicholas Mizer (2013) had a confederate approach an individual at a bus stop in Las Vegas, and \u201cpretended to notice chips in his pocket, stopped briefly and claimed to the participant that he was late for a ride to the airport and asked the individual if he/she wanted the casino chips, which he did not have time to cash in,\u201d and which were worth $20 (2013: 290). Ten feet away with his back turned to the participant was another confederate. The confederate with the chips would also add, \u201cI don\u2019t know, you can split it with that guy however you want\u201d while pointing towards the second confederate (2013: 290). However, in stark contrast to the results earlier, here every single participant kept all $20 for themselves (2013: 291). Several writers have claimed that external validity might be limited because the laboratory results for dictator games could be heavily influenced by experimenter demand effects (Zizzo 2010, 2013, Winking and Mizer 2013.\n",
