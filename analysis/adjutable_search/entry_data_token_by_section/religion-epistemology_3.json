    "main_text": "Natural theology\n4. Natural theology\n\n\nTheistic philosophers may, of course, grant evidentialism and even\ngrant its hegemony, but defend theism by providing the case which\nevidentialists demand. Here the details of the arguments are not\nwithin the scope of an article on epistemology. What is of interest is\nthe kind of argument put forward. For a start there is the\nproject of demonstrating God\u2019s existence, and this project is\nnot restricted to neo-Thomists. (See Craig 1979, Braine 1988, Miller\n1991.) To show the justifiability of full belief that there is a God\nit is sufficient (a) to have a deductively valid argument from\npremisses which are themselves justifiably held with full belief\nunless defeated by an objection and (b) to have considered and\ndefeated all available objections to either the premisses, the\nconclusion or any intermediate steps. Some of the premisses of these\narguments are said to be self-evident, that is, obvious once you think\nabout it. (E.g., the denial of the explanatory power of an infinite\ncausal regress, or the principle that the existence of any composite\nthing needs to be explained). And that raises a further\nepistemological problem. Does something\u2019s being self-evident to you\njustify your full belief in it even if you know of those of equal or\ngreater intellectual ability to whom it is not self-evident?\n\n\nMany natural theologians have, however, abandoned the search for\ndemonstrative arguments, appealing instead to ones which are probable,\neither in the sense of having weight but being inconclusive or in the\nsense of having a mathematical probability assigned to them. Notable\nin this regard are Mitchell\u2019s cumulative argument (Mitchell 1973) and\nSwinburne\u2019s Bayesian reliance on probability (Swinburne 1979). In a\npopular exposition of his argument Swinburne appeals instead to an\ninference to the best explanation (Swinburne 1995; see also Forrest\n1996). While there are differences of approach, the common theme is\nthat there is evidence for theism but evidence of a probable rather\nthan a conclusive kind, justifying belief but not full belief.\n",
