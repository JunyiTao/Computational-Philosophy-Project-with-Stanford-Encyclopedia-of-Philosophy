    "main_text": "Ontological Naturalism || Making a Causal Difference\n1.1 Making a Causal Difference\nA central thought in ontological naturalism is that all\nspatiotemporal entities must be identical to or metaphysically\nconstituted by \nphysical[3] \nentities. Many ontological naturalists thus\nadopt a physicalist attitude to mental, biological, social and other such\n\u201cspecial\u201d subject matters. They hold that there is\nnothing more to the mental, biological and social realms than\narrangements of physical entities.\nThe driving motivation for this kind of ontological naturalism is\nthe need to explain how special entities can have physical effects.\nThus many contemporary thinkers adopt a physicalist view of the mental\nrealm because they think that otherwise we will be unable to explain\nhow mental events can causally influence our bodies and other\nphysical items. Similar considerations motivate ontologically\nnaturalist views of the biological realm, the social realm, and so\non.\nIt may not be immediately obvious why this need to account for\nphysical effects should impose any substantial naturalist constraints\non some category. After all, there seems nothing a priori\nincoherent in the idea of radically unscientific\n\u201csupernatural\u201d events exerting a causal influence on\nphysical processes, as is testified by the conceptual cogency of\ntraditional stories about the worldly interventions of immaterial\ndeities and other outlandish beings.\nHowever, there may be a posteriori objections to such\nnon-natural causal influences on the physical world, even if there are\nno a priori objections. We shall see below how modern\nscientific theory places strong restrictions on the kinds of entities\nthat can have physical effects. Given that mental, biological and\nsocial phenomena do have such effects, it follows that they must\nsatisfy the relevant restrictions.\nNote how this kind of argument bites directly only on those\ncategories that do have physical effects. It places no immediate\nconstraints on categories that lack any such effects, which arguably\ninclude the mathematical and modal realms, and perhaps the moral\nrealm.  We shall return to the question of whether there are any\nfurther reasons for ontologically naturalist views about such putatively\nnon-efficacious categories in sections 1.7\nand 1.8 below.\n",
