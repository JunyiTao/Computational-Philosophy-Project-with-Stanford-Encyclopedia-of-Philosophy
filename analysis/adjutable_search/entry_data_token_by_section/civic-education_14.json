Modern Forms of Civic Education\n\nIn the United States, most students are required to take courses on\ngovernment or civics, and the main content is essentially political\nscience for high school students. In other words, they use textbooks\nand other written materials to learn about the formal structure and\nbehavior of political institutions, from local government to the\nUnited Nations (Godsay et al., 2012). The philosophical justifications\nfor this kind of curriculum are rarely developed fully, but probably\nan underlying idea is that citizens ought to play certain concrete\nroles--voting, monitoring the news, serving on juries, petitioning the\ngovernment--and to do so effectively requires a baseline understanding\nof the political system. Another implicit goal may be to increase\nyoung people\u2019s appreciation of the existing constitutional\nsystem so that they will be motivated to preserve it.\n\nMichael Rebell (2018) argues that both the United States Constitution\nand most states\u2019 constitutional provisions regarding public\neducation provide support for a right to adequate civic\neducation. Specific policies should result from a deliberative\nprocess to define the educational opportunities that all students must\nreceive and to select appropriate outcomes for civic education \u2013\nall overseen by a court concerned with assessing whether civic\neducation is constitutionally \"adequate.\"\n\nState standards are regulatory documents that affect the curriculum in\npublic schools. All 50 states and the District of Columbia have\nadopted standards for civics as part of social studies (Godsay et al,\n2012). The  College, Career, and Civic Life (\"C3\") Framework for\nSocial Studies State Standards (National Council for the Social\nStudies, 2013) provides a general framework for states to use as they\ndesign or revise these standards. It organizes civics \u2013 along\nwith history, geography and economics \u2013 into one \"Inquiry Arc\"\nthat extends from \"Developing Questions and Planning Inquiries,\" to\n\"Applying Disciplinary Concepts and Tools,\" to \"Evaluating Sources and\nEvidence,\" to \"Communicating Conclusions and Taking Informed Action.\"\nThe Arc is presented as applicable from kindergarten through high\nschool, but with increasingly demanding content. The logic of moving\nfrom question-generation to (ultimately) action suggests an implicit\ntheory of civic engagement.\n\nIn the subsequent sections, we examine some proposals for alternative\nforms of civic education that are also philosophically\ninteresting.\n",
