    "main_text": "Kant\u2019s Philosophy of Religion during the Critical Period || The Highest Good\n3.4 The Highest Good\n\nKant\u2019s doctrine of the highest good is the foundation of his\npositive philosophy of religion. With the exception of some musings\n(esp. in the Critique of Pure Reason) about an assent driven\nby our regulative employment of purposiveness (cf. B426, A670/B698 and\nA826/B854), the path to religion is through the highest good. It is\nthrough this doctrine that Kant endorses belief in God\u2019s\nexistence as well as the immortality of the soul. It is also through\nthis doctrine that Kant sets out what in the Religion he\ncalls the Pure Rational System of Religion. Therein, Kant appraises\nChristian doctrines to determine whether or not they are conducive to\nour duty to pursue the highest good (see\n section 3.6.4\n and\n section 3.7\n below).\n\nIn the Critique of Practical Reason, Kant distinguishes\nbetween the \u201csupreme\u201d, the \u201ccomplete\u201d, and\n\u201chighest\u201d good. By \u201csupreme good\u201d, he means\nthe good that is \u201cnot subordinate to any other\u201d (AK 5:110\n[1788]). That is, if there are a plurality of values, the supreme good\nis the one that overrides the rest. Hence, if pleasure were taken as a\nvalue, its value would be subordinate to morality, and thus its value\nwould be defeated or overridden if the pleasure comes through a\nviolation of the moral law.\n\nThe \u201ccomplete good\u201d is one that \u201cis not part of a\nstill greater whole of the same kind\u201d (AK 5:110 [1788). Kant\nthen explains that while morality is the supreme good, it is not the\ncomplete good \u201cas the object of the faculty of desire of\nrational finite beings\u201d (AK 5:110). This is because in addition\nto morality, finite rational beings also desire happiness. So,\nalthough happiness is subordinate to morality, morality is not the\n\u201ccomplete good\u201d because it does not encompass all that we\ndesire.\n\nKant then presents the highest good as a synthesis of morality and\nhappiness in order to meet the axiological principles of supremacy and\ncompleteness. More specifically, he presents the highest good as an\nideal state of affairs in which there is a proportional distribution\nof happiness in accordance with moral worth (A809/B837, AK 5:110 &\n5:145 [1788]; AK 5:471 [1790]; AK 6:8n & 6:99 [1793]; AK 8:139\n[1785a]; AK 8:281 [1764]). Nevertheless, some interpreters have\nproposed that Kant withdrew this formulation in later years,\nsupporting instead the notion that the highest good reflects the idea\nof maximal happiness and maximal morality as two independent variables\n(Reath 1988, Guyer 2011, Moran 2012). However, Pasternack (2017a)\nargues at length that the corpus neither supports this nor the\nputative abandonment of one or both of the postulates of God and\nimmortality (see\n section 3.5.2\n below).\n",
