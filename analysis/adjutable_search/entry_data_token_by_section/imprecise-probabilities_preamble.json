    "main_text": "\n\n\nIt has been argued that imprecise probabilities are a natural and\nintuitive way of overcoming some of the issues with orthodox precise\nprobabilities.  Models of this type have a long pedigree, and interest\nin such models has been growing in recent years.  This article\nintroduces the theory of imprecise probabilities, discusses the\nmotivations for their use and their possible advantages over the\nstandard precise model.  It then discusses some philosophical issues\nraised by this model.  There is also a historical appendix which\nprovides an overview of some important thinkers who appear sympathetic\nto imprecise probabilities.\n\n",
