    "main_text": "Explanatory Approaches to Development || Genetics\n3.1 Genetics\n\nMany philosophers have turned to explanations of development over the\npast two decades in an effort to esteem or deflate claims about the\ncausal power of genes (Keller 2002; Neumann-Held and Rehmann-Sutter\n2006; Rosenberg 2006; Robert 2004; Waters\n 2007a).[9]\n Genetic explanations touch the philosophical theme of reductionism\nand appear to constitute the bulk of empirical success accruing to\ndevelopmental biology over the past several\n decades.[10]\n Statements from developmental biologists reinforce this\nperspective:\n\n\nDevelopmental biology \u2026 deals with the process by which the\ngenes in the fertilized egg control cell behavior in the embryo and so\ndetermine its pattern, its form, and much of its behavior \u2026\ndifferential gene activity controls development. (Wolpert et al. 1998:\nv, 15)\n\n\nThese types of statements are sometimes amplified in appeals to a\ngenetic program for development.\n\n\n[Elements of the genome] contain the sequence-specific code for\ndevelopment; and they determine the particular outcome of\ndevelopmental processes, and thus the form of the animal produced by\nevery embryo. \u2026 Development is the execution of the genetic\nprogram for construction of a given species of organism (Davidson\n2006: 2,\n 16).[11]\n\n\nAt other times, statements concentrate on genetics as the primary\nlocus of causation in ontogeny: \u201cDevelopmental complexity is the\ndirect output of the spatially specific expression of particular gene\nsets and it is at this level that we can address causality in\ndevelopment\u201d (Davidson and Peter 2015: 2). Whether or not these\nstatements can be substantiated has been the subject of intense\n debate.[12]\n The strongest claims about genetic programs or the genetic control of\ndevelopment have empirical and conceptual drawbacks that include an\ninattention to plasticity and the role of the environment, an\nambiguity about the locus of causal agency, and a reliance on\nmetaphors drawn from computer science (Gilbert and Epel 2009; Keller\n2002; Moss 2002; Robert 2004). However, this leaves intact the\ndifference-making principle of genetic explanation exhibited in\nmolecular genetics (Waters 2007a), which yields more narrow and\nprecise causal claims under controlled experimental conditions, and is\napplicable to diverse molecular entities that play causal roles during\ndevelopment, such as regulatory RNAs, proteins, and environmental\nsignals. We can observe this briefly by reconsidering the example of\nvertebrate cardiogenesis\n (Section 1.2).\n\nAre there problems with claiming that genes contain all of the\ninformation (see the entry on\n biological information)\n to form vertebrate hearts? Is there a genetic program in the DNA\ncontrolling heart development? Are genes the primary supplier and\norganizer of material resources for heart development, largely\ndetermining the phenotypic outcome? Existing studies of heart\ndevelopment have identified a role for fluid forces in specifying the\ninternal form of the heart (Hove et al. 2003) and its left/right\nasymmetry (Nonaka et al. 2002). Biochemical gradients of extracellular\ncalcium are responsible for activating the asymmetric expression of\nthe regulatory gene Nodal (Raya et al. 2004) and inhibition\nof voltage gradients scrambles normal asymmetry establishment (Levin\net al. 2002). Mechanical cues such as microenvironmental stiffness are\ncrucial for key transitions from migratory cells into organized sheets\nduring heart formation (Jackson et al. 2017). A number of genes are\nclearly difference makers in these processes (Asp et al. 2019;\nSrivastava 2006; Brand 2003; Olson 2006), but the conclusion that\ngenes carry all the information needed to generate form features of\nthe heart seems unwarranted. While it may be warranted empirically in\nsome cases to privilege DNA sequence differences as causal factors in\nspecific processes of ontogeny (Waters 2007a), such as hierarchically\norganized networks of genetic difference makers explaining tissue\nspecification (Peter and Davidson 2011), the diversity of entities\nappealed to in molecular genetics and the extent of their individual\nand joint roles in specifying developmental outcomes implies that\ndebates about the meaning, scope, and power of genetic explanations\nwill continue (Griffiths and Stotz 2013). However, a shift away from\ngenetic programs and genetic determinism to DNA, RNA, and proteins as\ndifference makers that operate conjointly suggests that we\nconceptualize other causal factors in a similar way.\n",
