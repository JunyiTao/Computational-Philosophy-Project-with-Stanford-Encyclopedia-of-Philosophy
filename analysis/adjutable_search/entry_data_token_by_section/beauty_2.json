    "main_text": "Philosophical Conceptions of Beauty || The Classical Conception\n2.1 The Classical Conception\n\nThe art historian Heinrich W\u00f6lfflin gives a fundamental\ndescription of the classical conception of beauty, as embodied in\nItalian Renaissance painting and architecture:\n\n\nThe central idea of the Italian Renaissance is that of perfect\nproportion. In the human figure as in the edifice, this epoch strove\nto achieve the image of perfection at rest within itself. Every form\ndeveloped to self-existent being, the whole freely co-ordinated:\nnothing but independently living parts\u2026. In the system of a\nclassic composition, the single parts, however firmly they may be\nrooted in the whole, maintain a certain independence. It is not the\nanarchy of primitive art: the part is conditioned by the whole, and\nyet does not cease to have its own life. For the spectator, that\npresupposes an articulation, a progress from part to part, which is a\nvery different operation from perception as a whole. (W\u00f6lfflin\n1932, 9\u201310, 15)\n\n\nThe classical conception is that beauty consists of an arrangement of\nintegral parts into a coherent whole, according to proportion,\nharmony, symmetry, and similar notions. This is a primordial Western\nconception of beauty, and is embodied in classical and neo-classical\narchitecture, sculpture, literature, and music wherever they appear.\nAristotle says in the Poetics that \u201cto be beautiful, a\nliving creature, and every whole made up of parts, must \u2026\npresent a certain order in its arrangement of parts\u201d (Aristotle,\nvolume 2, 2322 [1450b34]). And in the Metaphysics: \u201cThe\nchief forms of beauty are order and symmetry and definiteness, which\nthe mathematical sciences demonstrate in a special degree\u201d\n(Aristotle, volume 2, 1705 [1078a36]). This view, as Aristotle implies,\nis sometimes boiled down to a mathematical formula, such as the golden\nsection, but it need not be thought of in such strict terms. The\nconception is exemplified above all in such texts as Euclid\u2019s\nElements and such works of architecture as the Parthenon,\nand, again, by the Canon of the sculptor Polykleitos (late\nfifth/early fourth century BCE).\n\nThe Canon was not only a statue deigned to display perfect\nproportion, but a now-lost treatise on beauty. The physician Galen\ncharacterizes the text as specifying, for example, the proportions of\n\u201cthe finger to the finger, and of all the fingers to the\nmetacarpus, and the wrist, and of all these to the forearm, and of the\nforearm to the arm, in fact of everything to everything\u2026. For\nhaving taught us in that treatise all the symmetriae of the\nbody, Polyclitus supported his treatise with a work, having made the\nstatue of a man according to his treatise, and having called the\nstatue itself, like the treatise, the Canon\u201d (quoted in\nPollitt 1974, 15). It is important to note that the concept of\n\u2018symmetry\u2019 in classical texts is distinct from and richer\nthan its current use to indicate bilateral mirroring. It also refers\nprecisely to the sorts of harmonious and measurable proportions among\nthe parts characteristic of objects that are beautiful in the\nclassical sense, which carried also a moral weight. For example, in\nthe Sophist (228c-e), Plato describes virtuous souls as\nsymmetrical.\n\nThe ancient Roman architect Vitruvius epitomizes the classical\nconception in central, and extremely influential, formulations, both\nin its complexities and, appropriately enough, in its underlying\nunity:\n\n\nArchitecture consists of Order, which in Greek is called\ntaxis, and arrangement, which the Greeks name\ndiathesis, and of Proportion and Symmetry and Decor and\nDistribution which in the Greeks is called oeconomia.\n\nOrder is the balanced adjustment of the details of the work\nseparately, and as to the whole, the arrangement of the proportion\nwith a view to a symmetrical result.\n\nProportion implies a graceful semblance: the suitable display of\ndetails in their context. This is attained when the details of the\nwork are of a height suitable to their breadth, of a breadth suitable\nto their length; in a word, when everything has a symmetrical\ncorrespondence.\n\nSymmetry also is the appropriate harmony arising out of the details of\nthe work itself: the correspondence of each given detail to the form\nof the design as a whole. As in the human body, from cubit, foot,\npalm, inch and other small parts come the symmetric quality of\neurhythmy. (Vitruvius, 26\u201327)\n\n\nAquinas, in a typically Aristotelian pluralist formulation, says that\n\u201cThere are three requirements for beauty. Firstly, integrity or\nperfection\u2014for if something is impaired it is ugly. Then there\nis due proportion or consonance. And also clarity: whence things that\nare brightly coloured are called beautiful\u201d (Summa\nTheologica I, 39, 8).\n\nFrancis Hutcheson in the eighteenth century gives what may well be the\nclearest expression of the view: \u201cWhat we call Beautiful in\nObjects, to speak in the Mathematical Style, seems to be in a compound\nRatio of Uniformity and Variety; so that where the Uniformity of Bodys\nis equal, the Beauty is as the Variety; and where the Variety is\nequal, the Beauty is as the Uniformity\u201d (Hutcheson 1725, 29).\nIndeed, proponents of the view often speak \u201cin the Mathematical\nStyle.\u201d Hutcheson goes on to adduce mathematical formulae, and\nspecifically the propositions of Euclid, as the most beautiful objects\n(in another echo of Aristotle), though he also rapturously praises\nnature, with its massive complexity underlain by universal physical\nlaws as revealed, for example, by Newton. There is beauty, he says,\n\u201cIn the Knowledge of some great Principles, or universal Forces,\nfrom which innumerable Effects do flow. Such is Gravitation, in Sir\nIsaac Newton\u2019s Scheme\u201d (Hutcheson 1725, 38).\n\nA very compelling series of refutations of and counter-examples to the\nidea that beauty can be a matter of any specific proportions between\nparts, and hence to the classical conception, is given by Edmund Burke\nin A Philosophical Enquiry into the Origin of our Ideas of the\nBeautiful and the Sublime:\n\n\nTurning our eyes to the vegetable kingdom, we find nothing there so\nbeautiful as flowers; but flowers are of every sort of shape, and\nevery sort of disposition; they are turned and fashioned into an\ninfinite variety of forms. \u2026 The rose is a large flower, yet it\ngrows upon a small shrub; the flower of the apple is very small, and\nit grows upon a large tree; yet the rose and the apple blossom are\nboth beautiful. \u2026 The swan, confessedly a beautiful bird, has a\nneck longer than the rest of its body, and but a very short tail; is\nthis a beautiful proportion? we must allow that it is. But what shall\nwe say of the peacock, who has comparatively but a short neck, with a\ntail longer than the neck and the rest of the body taken together?\n\u2026 There are some parts of the human body, that are observed to\nhold certain proportions to each other; but before it can be proved,\nthat the efficient cause of beauty lies in these, it must be shewn,\nthat wherever these are found exact, the person to whom they belong is\nbeautiful. \u2026 For my part, I have at several times very\ncarefully examined many of these proportions, and found them to hold\nvery nearly, or altogether alike in many subjects, which were not only\nvery different from one another, but where one has been very\nbeautiful, and the other very remote from beauty. \u2026 You may\nassign any proportions you please to every part of the of the human\nbody; and I undertake, that a painter shall observe them all, and\nnotwithstanding produce, if he pleases, a very ugly figure. (Burke\n1757, 84\u201389)\n\n",
