    "main_text": "Esotericism\n8. Conclusion\n\n\nHow one assesses Maimonides\u2019 philosophy depends on one\u2019s own\nphilosophic view. For a traditional theist like Aquinas, he is right to\nsay that there are issues, e.g. creation, that cannot be resolved by\ndemonstration and to insist that all attempts to anthropomorphize God\nare misguided. The problem is that in rejecting anthropomorphism, he\nmay have gone too far. If God bears no likeness to the created order,\nand if terms like wise, powerful, or lives\nare completely ambiguous when applied to God and us, the conception of\ndivinity we are left with is too thin for the average worshipper to\nappreciate.\n\n\nFor a naturalist like Spinoza, Maimonides is too willing to dismiss\nscience and take refuge in traditional concepts like creation and\ndivine volition. Granted that medieval astronomy did not have a good\nexplanation of planetary motion; with the advent of the scientific\nrevolution, it found one \u2013 at least in Spinoza\u2019s opinion.\nIf Maimonides were to remain true to his word and accept the strongest\nargument wherever it leads, as far as Spinoza\u2019s is concerned, he\nwould have to embrace the new science, the eternity of the world, and\nthe necessity of every event that takes place in it. In order to do\nthis, he would have to abandon the idea that the Bible is a source of\nphilosophic and scientific truth and look to it only for the light it\nsheds on how to live. Needless to say, this would be a disaster for\nMaimonides.\n\n\nEven if Maimonides were to make this move and read the Bible for its\nethical content, problems would remain. Maimonides is an elitist.\nCloseness to God is measured by how much knowledge one acquires. The\nresult is that people whose situations prevent them from pursuing\nadvanced studies cannot be close to God or love God. Whether it is\nright or wrong, this view offends modern sensibilities, which are much\nmore democratic.\n\n\nFinally for an atheist, Maimonides\u2019 philosophy shows us what happens\nif you remove all anthropomorphic content from your conception of God:\nyou remove all content of any kind. In the end, you are left with a God\nwhose essence is unknowable and indescribable.  Of what possible value is\nsuch a conception either to philosophy or religion?\n\n\nAt his trial for impiety in 399 B.C., Socrates was asked how it is\nthat the wisest person in Athens claims to be ignorant of the\nknowledge he seeks. His answer (Apology 23a-b) is that he is\nwise because unlike others, he recognizes that when measured against\ndivine wisdom, human wisdom is of little or no value. Although it is\ndoubtful that he read Socrates\u2019 words, there is little question that\nthis is the insight Maimonides is trying to preserve. That person is\nwisest who recoils in awe and humility in the face of something\ninfinitely greater than he or she can fathom. This insight explains\nwhy, despite his best efforts, Maimonides was unable to find airtight\ndemonstrations for many of his insights about God, creation, and\nrevelation and is often content just to tip the scales in one\ndirection or present an honest assessment of the problem.  In a recent\nwork, Alfred Ivry (2016, 4) contends that Maimonides himself is\none of the perplexed for whom the Guide was written.\n\nViewed in a sympathetic light, Maimonides\u2019 elitism stems\nfrom the recognition that few people will be satisfied with this.\nAlthough not everyone in the history of philosophy would agree, there\nis no question that Maimonides\u2019 view has a long history and remains a\npowerful alternative.\n",
