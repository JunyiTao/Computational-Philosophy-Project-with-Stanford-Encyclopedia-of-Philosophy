    "main_text": "Theory of Universals and the Logic of Place || Absolute Nothingness\n3.1 Absolute Nothingness\n\n\nThe topos of absolute nothingness is the ultimate \u201cwithin\nwhich\u201d all reality takes place.  It can be understood as an\nalternative to a transcendent determiner of the world as\nconceptualized, for example, in medieval philosophy\u2019s notion of God,\nFichte\u2019s transcendental ego, or Husserl\u2019s transcendental\nsubjectivity. Nishida did use the language of transcendence to explain\nabsolute nothingness, saying it transcended the opposition between\nbeing and non-being, for example; but such language did not indicate\nany thing, power, or consciousness beyond the world. Absolute\nnothingness is infinitely determinable and its determinates form the\nactual world, but this \u201cself-determination\u201d occurs\n\u201cwithout anything that does the determining,\u201d like an agency without an agent. Equally paradoxical are the positive\ndescriptions Nishida gives it, in spite of the implicit claim that it\ndefies description. Rather than a mere absence of being, meaning, or\nfunction, absolute nothingness is active and creative in forming the\nactual world; and it manifests or awakens to itself through\nself-awareness. It is the foundation of the world and of the self\nwhich is a focal point of the world; but it is an uncommon kind of\nfoundation in that it functions through self-negation. It cannot be\ncalled \u201cabsolute\u201d unless it negates any particular\ndetermination of it and simultaneously enfolds them all. It is the\nuniversal of universals. Nishida was not able to combine these various\ndescriptions into one coherent notion, but they partially converge in\nthe sense of an undifferentiated whole that includes all its\ndifferentiations.\n",
