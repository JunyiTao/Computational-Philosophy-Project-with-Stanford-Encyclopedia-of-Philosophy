    "main_text": "Promises and Other Fields || Promises and Speech Acts\n6.1 Promises and Speech Acts\n\nPromises have often been cast as speech acts, or actions that we\nperform by speaking. The locus classicus for this issue is J.\nL. Austin\u2019s 1962 book How to Do Things with Words. In\nit Austin defines two sorts of speech acts, or\n\u201cperformatives\u201d: illocutions and perlocutions. Illocutions\nare those actions that we perform by uttering the words alone. Austin\nlists requesting, warning and announcing as examples. Alternatively,\nperlocutions are actions performed by speaking which require some\nparticular effect of the speech in order to be successful.\nAustin cites persuading, explaining and alarming as examples of the\nlatter sort of locution.\n\nAustin takes promising to be an illocutionary act, that is, he takes\nit that promising is merely a matter of a certain form of\nutterance, under certain conditions. Moreover the reason he takes this\nto be is that he thinks that promising is a conventional act,\none that invokes a certain practice to formalize the action. Austin\nthinks that in this way promises are just of a piece with many sorts\nof obligation-producing actions, such as betting, buying and\ncontracting (Austin 1962 [1975: 19])\n\nAustin\u2019s linguistic distinction mirrors the crucial difference\nbetween the expectational and conventional theories of promising. On\nthe conventionalist view that Austin adopts, promises are\n\u201cconventional\u201d moves in the game, and as such one promises\nby \u201cmaking the right moves\u201d, i.e., saying the right sorts\nof things and otherwise obeying the rules of the game.\n\nSearle, taking up the speech-act framework pioneered by J. L.\nAustin\u2014similarly makes promises out to be a particular form of\nspeech act\u2014(see Searle 1963, 1965, 1965, 1979) a non-verbal\naction affected by speech, of a piece with \u201cordering\u201d and\n\u201cagreeing\u201d. Searle, like Austin, is a paradigmatic\nconventionalist his work has been widely influential, and has helped\nto grow the literature on both promises and speech act theory (cf.\nSearle et al. 1980, inter alia)\n\nThe investigation of promises as speech acts is furthered in the work\nof Rawls (1955), William Alston (1964, 1994), John Searle (1963, 1965,\n1979, 1980, 1985), David Jones (1966), Otto Hanfling (1975), and\nMichael Pratt (2003, 2007), Christina Corredor (2001), and Vincent\nBlok (2013) among others.
