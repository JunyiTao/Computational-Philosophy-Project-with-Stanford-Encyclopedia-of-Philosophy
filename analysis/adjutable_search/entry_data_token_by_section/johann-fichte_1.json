    "main_text": "Fichte\u2019s Philosophical Project\n2. Fichte\u2019s Philosophical Project\n\nThe primary task of Fichte\u2019s system of philosophy (the\nWissenschaftslehre) is to reconcile freedom with necessity,\nor, more specifically, to explain how freely willing, morally\nresponsible agents can at the same time be considered part of a world\nof causally conditioned material objects in space and time.\nFichte\u2019s strategy for answering this question\u2014at least in\nhis early writings, which are the ones upon which his historical\nreputation as a philosopher has (at least until recently) been\ngrounded and hence are the ones to be expounded here\u2014was to\nbegin simply with the ungrounded assertion of the subjective\nspontaneity and freedom (infinity) of the I and then to proceed to a\ntranscendental derivation of objective necessity and limitation\n(finitude) as a condition necessary for the possibility of the former.\nThis is the meaning of his description, in his \u201cFirst\nIntroduction to the Wissenschaftslehre,\u201d of\nphilosophy\u2019s task as that of \u201cdisplaying the foundation of\nexperience\u201d or \u201cexplaining the basis of the system of\nrepresentations accompanied by a feeling of necessity.\u201d Fichte\nderived this conception of the task and strategy of philosophy from\nhis study of Kant, and no matter how far his own system seemed to\ndiverge from \u201cthe letter\u201d of the Critical philosophy,\nFichte always maintained that it remained true to \u201cthe\nspirit\u201d of the same. Central to this \u201cspirit,\u201d for\nFichte, is an uncompromising insistence upon the practical certainty\nof human freedom and a thoroughgoing commitment to the task of\nproviding a transcendental account of ordinary experience that could\nexplain the objectivity and necessity of theoretical reason\n(cognition) in a manner consistent with the practical affirmation of\nhuman liberty. Though Fichte attributed the discovery of this task to\nKant, he believed that it was first accomplished successfully only in\nthe Wissenschaftslehre, which he therefore described as the\nfirst \u201csystem of human freedom.\u201d\n\nIn an effort to clarify the task and method of transcendental\nphilosophy, Fichte insisted upon the sharp distinction between the\n\u201cstandpoint\u201d of natural consciousness (which it is the\ntask of philosophy to \u201cderive,\u201d and hence to\n\u201cexplain\u201d) and that of transcendental reflection, which is\nthe standpoint required of the philosopher. He thus insisted that\nthere is no conflict between transcendental idealism and the\ncommonsense realism of everyday life. On the contrary, the whole point\nof the former is to demonstrate the necessity and unavailability of\nthe latter.\n\nHowever \u201cKantian\u201d in spirit Fichte\u2019s enterprise\nmight have been, he was at the same time all too keenly aware of what\nhe considered to be certain glaring weaknesses and inadequacies in\nKant\u2019s own execution of this project. Taking to heart the\ncriticisms of such contemporaries as F. H. Jacobi, Salomon Maimon, and\nG. E. Schulze, Fichte propounded a radically revised version of the\nCritical philosophy. First of all, he argued that the very concept of\na \u201cthing in itself,\u201d understood as a mind-independent,\nexternal \u201ccause\u201d of sensations, is indefensible on\nCritical grounds. In addition, he maintained that Kant\u2019s denial\nof the possibility of \u201cintellectual intuition,\u201d though\ncertainly justified as a denial of the possibility of any non-sensory\nawareness of external objects, is nevertheless difficult to reconcile\nwith certain other Kantian doctrines regarding the I\u2019s immediate\npresence to itself both as a (theoretically) cognizing subject (the\ndoctrine of the transcendental apperception) and as a (practically)\nstriving moral agent (the doctrine of the categorical imperative).\n\nHis study of the writings of K. L. Reinhold convinced Fichte that the\nsystematic unity of the Critical philosophy\u2014specifically, the\nunity of theoretical and practical reason, of the First and Second\nCritiques\u2014was insufficiently evident in Kant\u2019s\nown presentation of his philosophy and that the most promising way to\ndisplay the unity in question would be to provide both theoretical and\npractical philosophy with a common foundation. The first task for\nphilosophy, Fichte therefore concluded, is to discover a single,\nself-evident starting point or first principle from which one could\nthen somehow \u201cderive\u201d both theoretical and practical\nphilosophy, which is to say, our experience of ourselves as finite\ncognizers and as finite agents. Not only would such a strategy\nguarantee the systematic unity of philosophy itself, but, more\nimportantly, it would also display what Kant hinted at but never\ndemonstrated: viz., the underlying unity of reason itself.\n\nSince it is a central task of philosophy, so construed, to establish\nthe very possibility of any knowledge or science\n(Wissenschaft) whatsoever, Fichte proposed to replace the\ndisputed term \u201cphilosophy\u201d (or \u201clove of\nwisdom\u201d) with the new term Wissenschaftslehre or\n\u2018Theory of Science\u2019\u2014a name intended to highlight the\ndistinctively \u201csecond order\u201d character of philosophical\nreflection. Though Fichte\u2019s proposal never caught on as a\ngeneral name for what was once called \u201cphilosophy,\u201d it did\nbecome the universally acknowledged name for his own distinctive\nversion of transcendental idealism. Here again, it is important to\nkeep in mind that \u201cWissenschaftslehre\u201d is not the\nname of any particular Fichtean treatise, but is instead the general\nname for his entire system or project\u2014an allegedly\nall-encompassing system that consists of a number of interrelated\nparts or systematic subdisciplines and an overarching project that\ncould and would be expounded in a series of radically different\npresentations, employing a bewildering variety of systematic\nvocabularies.\n",
