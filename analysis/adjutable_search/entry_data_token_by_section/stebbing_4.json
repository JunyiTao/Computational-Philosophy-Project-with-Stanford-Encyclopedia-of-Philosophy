Politics and Critical Thinking\n\nDuring the mid 1930s, Stebbing engaged increasingly with a general or\neven popular, as opposed to an exclusively philosophical or academic,\naudience. This development in her work was driven by her belief that\nthe structures and principles of formal logic need not be seen as a\nclosed, isolated system, but rather could profitably be applied to the\nproblems and issues of modern life. This was coupled with a commitment\nto the practical analysis of the texts in which these problems were\npresented and discussed, in order to identify any illogical, flawed or\nmisleading thinking. In Logic in Practice (1934) she had\nalready aimed at a more general readership, including more overt\npolitical commentary than in A Modern Introduction to Logic,\noffering examples drawn from political speeches and newspaper reports\nto demonstrate examples of muddled argument and biased description. In\nPhilosophy and the Physicists (1937), her focus was on the\nlanguage used by scientists to explain their ideas\u2014particularly\nby scientists who proposed to present these ideas in a way that was\npalatable, and indeed entertaining, to a popular audience. Stebbing\nworried that imprecise, impressionistic or sensational uses of\nlanguage obscured the nature of recent scientific advances and, worse\nstill, encouraged unjustified inferences and beliefs to be drawn from\nthem.\n\nOne of Stebbing\u2019s main targets was Sir Arthur Eddington, a then\nprominent public figure whose photographs of the eclipse in 1919 had\nhelped to confirm Einstein\u2019s theory of relativity. Eddington\nliked to grip his readers\u2019 attention and their imagination by\nrequiring them to consider everyday experiences in the light of\nscientific discoveries. In this passage from his popular book The\nNature of the Physical World (1935), he is concerned with the\natomic theory of matter:\n\n\nI am standing on the threshold about to enter a room. It is a\ncomplicated business. In the first place I must shove against an\natmosphere pressing with a force of fourteen pounds on every square\ninch of my body. I must make sure of landing on a plank traveling at\ntwenty miles a second round the sun\u2014a fraction of a second too\nearly or too late, the plank would be miles away. I must do this\nwhilst hanging from a round planet head outward into space, and with a\nwind of aether blowing at no one knows how many miles a second through\nevery interstice of my body. The plank has no solidity of substance.\nTo step on it is like stepping on a swarm of flies. Shall I not slip\nthrough? No, if I make the venture one of the flies hits me and gives\na boost up again; I fall again and am knocked upwards by another fly;\nand so on. I may hope that the net result will be that I remain about\nsteady; but if unfortunately I should slip through the floor or be\nboosted too violently up to the ceiling, the occurrence would be, not\na violation of the laws of Nature, but a rare coincidence. (1935:\n328)\n\n\nStebbing disliked this way of explaining physics, because of the\ncasual misuse it made of everyday language, and also because of the\nmuch larger implications Eddington encouraged his reader to draw from\nit. In Philosophy and the Physicists she drew attention to\nthese issues. She argued, for instance, that it simply made no sense\nto say \u201cthe plank has no solidity of substance\u201d. The word\n\u201csolid\u201d just means having properties such as those of a\nplank. Whatever developments in physics may indicate, a plank with no\nsolidity is simply a nonsense, or a contradiction. Science must find\nother language in which to express these findings, since using\neveryday language to do so will only mislead and confuse. In fact,\nalthough Eddington ignored or even concealed this fact, scientists had\nfound it necessary to develop new and highly formal systems for\nexpressing their findings, since they were describing a very different\ntype of reality from that of everyday experience. Eddington\u2019s\npersistent use of everyday language to describe scientific knowledge\nwas designed to have an emotional rather than an informative impact on\nhis readership. Here is Stebbing\u2019s own version of the business\nof walking into a room:\n\n\nI enter my study and see the blue curtains fluttering in the breeze,\nfor the windows are open. I notice a bowl of roses on the table; it\nwas not there when I went out. Clumsily I stumble against the table,\nbruising my leg against its hard edge; it is a heavy table and\nscarcely moves under the impact of my weight. I take a rose from the\nbowl, press it to my face, feel the softness of the petals, and smell\nits characteristic scent. I rejoice in the beauty of the graded\nshading of the crimson petals. In short\u2014I am in a familiar room,\nseeing, touching, smelling, familiar things, thinking familiar\nthoughts, experiencing familiar emotions. (1937: 45)\n\n\nStebbing\u2019s point is that ordinary language very adequately and\nindeed very accurately describes everyday experience. That description\ndoes not coincide with the scientific understanding of matter, and nor\nshould it; for that a different type of language is necessary. The\ndanger was that once Eddington had got his readership thinking about\nthe scientific conception of matter in relation to everyday language,\nhe was able to manipulate their understanding of the possible\nconsequences of recent scientific developments for our understanding\nof other areas of human experience, including the spiritual and even\nthe religious. Eddington argued that the behaviour of material objects\nwas now shown to be random and unpredictable, rather than controlled\nby determinate laws of physics. Our understanding of the world around\nus as relatively stable and ordered was imposed on reality by our own\nperceptions. This, in turn, opened up the possibility of the scientific\nviability of other types of truth or reality, including the mental,\nthe spiritual and, for Eddington, the divine.\n\nIf Philosophy and the Physicists was written to guard its\nreadership against imprecise or misleading use of language by\nscientists, Stebbing\u2019s next major publication had an even more\nearnest and urgent purpose. Thinking to Some Purpose was\npublished in 1939. It was a direct result of the increasing pressure\non Stebbing to become a more prominent commentator on current affairs\nand to contribute to public intellectual debate; the BBC commissioned\na series of talks from Stebbing which she was unable to deliver\nbecause of ill health but which she published instead in the newly\nestablished Penguin series of \u201coriginal non-fiction books on\ncontemporary issues\u201d. Although Stebbing was reluctant to play a\nprominent public role, she was committed to the necessity of academics\ncontributing to the discussion of crucial social and political issues.\nThinking to Some Purpose was written before the beginning of\nthe Second World War, but it was produced at a time when Stebbing,\nlike many others, was well aware of the gravity of the national and\ninternational situation, and of what was at stake. She was convinced\nthat it was imperative that the electorate, now universally franchised\nand generally literate, should be equipped to deal with the type of\nrhetoric that was being directed at them:\n\n\nthe citizens must be able to think relevantly, that is, to think to\nsome purpose. Thus to think is difficult. Accordingly, it is not\nsurprising, however saddening it may be, that many of our statesmen do\nnot trust the citizens to think, but rely instead upon the arts of\npersuasion. (1939: 14)\n\n\nThe book is full of analyses of actual uses of language by those\ntrying to persuade others to take a particular course of action:\nadvertisers, journalists, clergymen and, particularly, politicians.\nStebbing urged readers to hone their critical skills in order to\nidentify uses of language that introduce assumptions rather than make\ndirect statements, or that hide parts of an argument that in logic\nwould need to be made explicit. A repeated target is Sir Stanley\nBaldwin, several times Conservative Prime Minister. For instance,\nStebbing quoted the following extract from a speech he gave while\ncampaigning on behalf of the National Government in the 1931 General\nElection. Baldwin\u2019s task was to explain how it would be possible\nfor Liberals and Conservative to work together in Government.\n\n\nThere must undoubtedly be some difficulty over the question of\ntariffs. Liberals would approach the problem with a Free Trade bias\nbut with an open mind to examine and decide whether there were\nmeasures of dealing with the problem apart from tariffs. Conservatives\nwould start with an open mind but with a favour for tariffs. They\nwould start with an open mind to examine alternative methods, and the\nCabinet as a whole would sit down with perfect honesty and sincerity\nto come to a decision on that matter. (quoted by Stebbing 1939:\n66)\n\n\nStebbing focussed on some of Baldwin\u2019s specific lexical\nchoices:\n\n\nYou will notice that Baldwin speaks of a Liberal bias for\nFree Trade and of a Conservative favour for tariffs. The word\n\u201cbias\u201d carries with it an emotional significance of having\nprejudged the matter in a way that could hardly be regarded\nas consistent with having an \u201copen mind\u201d. The word\n\u201cfavour\u201d does not, I think, have this significance. (1939:\n66\u20137)\n\n\nIn numerous other examples in Thinking to Some Purpose,\nStebbing drew attention to the ways in which speakers and writers can\npotentially have a strong influence on the beliefs and actions of\ntheir audiences, not just through what they literally say but through\nhow their choice of words introduces ideological assumptions or\ndisguises necessary steps in an argument.\n",
