    "main_text": "The Public Justification Principle || Granularity\n2.2 Granularity\n\nWhat is the object of public justification? What is the thing that we\npublicly justify? Answers differ, and we can classify them by their\n\u201cgranularity.\u201d Some exercises of political power and state\ncoercion are small, like legal regulations, while others are broader,\nlike constitutions. If we take laws as our object of justification, we\ntake a fine-grained approach. But if constitutions are our object, we\ntake a coarse-grained approach.\n\nRawls (2005, 140) adopts a coarse-grained approach, applying public\njustification to \u201cconstitutional essentials\u201d and\n\u201cbasic questions of justice.\u201d Jonathan Quong (2004,\n233\u2013259) adopts a fine-grained approach. He applies public\njustification first to laws. Gaus (2011, 495) focuses on laws that\nlack \u201cstrong interactive effects\u201d with other laws. For\ninstance, a smoking ban lacks strong interactive effects with a corn\nsubsidy, and so they should be justified separately.\n\nGaus\u2019s case for fine-grained \u201cindividuation\u201d of\nproposals involves two arguments. We must justify at a level narrow\nenough to identify which forms of behavior are permitted or not. But\nwe must justify at a level wide enough to see rules as governing\nclasses of behavior (Gaus 2011, 122\u2013125). This entry\u2019s\nformulation of the PJP focuses on law \\(L\\) for brevity, and it\nacknowledges that public justification theorists work with other\nobjects of justification.\n",
