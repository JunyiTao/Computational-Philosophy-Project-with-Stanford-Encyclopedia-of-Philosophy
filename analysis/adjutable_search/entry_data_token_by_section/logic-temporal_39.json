    "main_text": "Combining temporal and other logics || Spatial-temporal logics\n9.3 Spatial-temporal logics\n\nSpace and time are intimately related in the physical world, and they\nhave become inseparable in modern physical theories. While early\nphysical theories, culminating in Newton\u2019s classical mechanics,\npresuppose an absolute notion of time independent from space,\nEinstein\u2019s relativity theory views time and space as\ninextricably interwoven, as modeled by Minkowski\u2019s\nfour-dimensional space-time manifold.\n\nCombined logical reasoning about space-time is discussed in Rescher\nand Urquhart (1971, Chapter XVI). In Goldblatt (1980), the Diodorean\nmodal logic of Minkowski space-time was studied and proved to be\nexactly the modal logic D4.2; further results are provided in Uckelman\nand Uckelman (2007). Logical investigations into relativity theory\nhave been conducted as well, see e.g. Andr\u00e9ka et al.\n(2007).\n\nIn Artificial Intelligence, space-time reasoning has been actively\nevolving over the past decades, particularly in the context of\nspatio-temporal databases, ontologies, and constraint networks. The\nmain focus here is on the logical characterization of spatio-temporal\nmodels, expressiveness, and computational complexity (Gabelaia et al.\n2005; Kontchakov et al. 2007).\n\nAnother interesting line of research is triggered by the theory of\nbranching space-times developed in Belnap (1992). This theory relates\nto space-time just as Prior\u2019s theory of branching time relates\nto linear time; that is, it combines space-time reasoning with\nindeterminism. See e.g. M\u00fcller (2013) and Placek (2014), where\nthe topology of branching space-times is studied against the\nbackground of relativity theory. An extensive overview of branching space-times can be found in Belnap et al. (2022).\n",
