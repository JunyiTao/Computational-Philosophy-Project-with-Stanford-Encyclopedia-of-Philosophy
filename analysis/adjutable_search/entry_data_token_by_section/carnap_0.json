    "main_text": "General Characterization of Carnap\u2019s Philosophy || Rational Reconstruction and Explication\n1.1 Rational Reconstruction and Explication\n\nCarnap differed fundamentally from the western philosophical tradition\nin his conception of philosophy and his attitude toward philosophical\nproblems. These supposed problems, he thought, were largely artifacts\nof our inadequate tools\u2014they originate in confusions due to the\nlanguages our species has evolved over millennia to deal with the\npractical problems of a pre-scientific and pre-technological everyday\nlife. These primitive tools leave us unequipped even to express, let\nalone to address, the traditional problems of philosophy coherently;\nour inherited languages distort the picture too badly, and to see\nthings more adequately we need to devise new concepts and organize our\nthoughts in less parochial categories. Just as we have devised new\nconcepts and vocabularies to find out about the world in systematic\nscientific inquiry, so we have to leave behind our traditional ways of\narticulating how everything fits together, how we should understand\nour place in the world, and how we should shape our lives in\nresponse.\n\nSo philosophical inquiry became, for Carnap, a kind of\n\u201cconceptual engineering\u201d (see Creath 1990, Flocke\nforthcoming-b) rather than a form of inquiry or search for knowledge.\nIt did not ask how things are, in Carnap\u2019s view, but rather\nhow\u2014within the constraints of our available tools and the\nknowledge available from the sciences\u2014we want things to\nbe. This form of \u201cvoluntarism\u201d (Jeffrey 1992) lies at the\nbasis of Carnap\u2019s philosophy from beginning to end.\n\nCarnap applied this voluntaristic conceptual engineering in many\ndifferent ways to many different problems, at different levels and on\ndifferent scales. He applied it both within science and to larger\nproblems about science (e.g., scientific language), or about\nthe place of science in our lives. He applied it both to local\nreconstructions or explications of particular concepts (e.g.,\nconfirmation), and more globally, to entire language frameworks (see\n section 1.2\n below). And he wanted the local and global to fit together; precise\ndefinitions of explicated concepts were to be situated within such\nlarger frameworks.\n\nThe terminology evolved over the years. Carnap tended to think of his\nfirst engineering projects as \u201crational reconstruction\u201d;\nlater he favored the term \u201cexplication\u201d. Both refer to the\nreconstruction or replacement of particular terms or concepts within\nour more primitive ordinary languages (or vestiges of them in\nscientific languages) rather than to the design and development of\nentire languages or language frameworks. There was a progressive\nchange of emphasis over the course of Carnap\u2019s career in the\ngoals and the scope of this reconstructive engineering. In the early\nyears Carnap (along with most of his colleagues in the 1920s Vienna\nCircle) saw these engineering projects in much the same light as the\neighteenth-century Encyclop\u00e9distes and\nnineteenth-century positivists had seen them. Ordinary language and\ntraditional concepts were to be overcome; they were to be\nreplaced by better and more scientific ones. Later,\nCarnap\u2019s view became more pluralistic and dialectical (Stein\n1992); he increasingly recognized the practical nature of conceptual\nengineering and allowed more room for the standpoint of the language\nuser, as well as the differing priorities and value systems involved\nin the choice of language frameworks or explications. Recently,\nCarnap\u2019s idea of explication has attracted a good deal of\nattention (Maher 2007; Kitcher 2008; Carus 2007a; Dutilh Novaes &\nReck 2017; Brun 2016; several papers in Wagner 2012), particularly\namong authors seeking to define the proper role of the new\nsubdiscipline of experimental philosophy (Justus 2012; Shepherd &\nJustus 2015; Schupbach 2017) or of the methodology of mathematical\nphilosophy (Leitgeb 2013). More details are to be found in the\nsupplement on\n Methodology.\n (For more on conceptual engineering more generally, see, e.g.,\nCappelen 2018.)\n",
