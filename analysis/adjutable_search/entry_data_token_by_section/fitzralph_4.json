Memory\nunderstanding and willing are to be found in the soul\u2019s complete\nnature but the soul is not to be found completely in any one of\nthem. As regards the relationship between willing and\nunderstanding, Wodeham will later specifically oppose FitzRalph for\ntreating them as distinct. FitzRalph, on the other hand, opposed\nAquinas for regarding memory and understanding as the same. For\nFitzRalph, memory, understanding and willing are not the same (which\nwas the position of Scotus and that adopted by Chatton against Ockham),\nneither are they really distinct but are distinguished inasmuch as the\nsoul expresses itself differently through these powers. Finally,\nfor FitzRalph actual knowledge is really distinct from the species in\nmemory, i.e., there is a real distinction between the powers.\n\n\nThe topic was a traditional one but FitzRalph\u2019s treatment\nshows how such a tradition was capable of renewal in the light of\ncontemporary developments such as the debate regarding the distinction\nbetween the mind and its powers and that between the powers itself, as\nwell as the species in memoria.\n",
