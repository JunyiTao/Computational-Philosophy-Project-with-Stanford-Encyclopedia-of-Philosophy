It seems that in all these cases, the Faculty members are\nmanifesting their agency\u2014they are all equally expressing their\ndissatisfaction with the cuts\u2014even if Larry does so by\n(intentionally) not doing something. Such cases of\nrefrainings and intentional omissions seem paradigmatic instances of\nagency and yet they do not seem to be cases of action: after all, the\nagent did nothing. But how could the absence of an action be a\nmanifestation of agency? One might be tempted to avoid any puzzling\nconclusions by simply denying that omissions are absences; by, for\ninstance, proposing that Larry\u2019s intentional omission consists\nin doing whatever acting he did instead of engaging in the\nomitted action. So if he goes to the bar instead of going to the\nholiday party, Larry omits to go to the party by going to the\nbar and so his going to the bar and his omitting to go to the party\nare the same event. However, this view immediately encounters\ndifficulties as it seems that I can intentionally omit to do things\nwithout engaging in any positive act. I can refrain from laughing at\nmy enemy\u2019s jokes just by staying still and I can intentionally\nomit things even while asleep (Clarke 2014): indeed, instead of going\nto the bar, Larry could have omitted to go to the party by simply\nsleeping through it.\n\nEarly attempts to explain how an agent might intentionally\nnot do something, without claiming that intentional omissions\nand refraining are actions, go back at least to Ryle (1973); Ryle\nargues that negative \u201cactions\u201d are not actions, but what\nhe calls \u201clines of actions\u2019, a category that also includes\ngeneral policies such as \u201dTake only cold baths\u201c. More\nrecently, Alvarez (2013) argues that the fact that omissions and\nrefrainings can also manifest agency is a consequence of the fact that\nthe power to act (intentionally) is a two-way power: a power to either\ndo or not do something. Thus, when I refrain from driving my\ncar, I manifest my agency not by engaging in an action, but rather by\nsettling on not driving it (See Steward 2012; 2020 for\nfurther defense of the idea of agency as a two-way power).\n",
