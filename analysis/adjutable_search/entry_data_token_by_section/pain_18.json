    "main_text": "Eliminativism about pain || Other arguments for eliminativism\n6.2 Other arguments for eliminativism\n\nIn her book, The Myth of Pain (1999), Valerie Hardcastle also\nargued for eliminating the commonsense understanding of pain and much\nof the ordinary pain talk. She argues that the commonsense notion of\npain conceives of pains as simple subjective sensations devoid of any\ncomplexity. According to Hardcastle, pain is a complex phenomenon\nconsisting of many dissociable dimensions. To the two components\n(sensory-discriminative and affective-motivational) we discussed\nabove, she adds, following Melzack and Wall (1988) and others, a\ncognitive component (involving judgments, beliefs, memories,\nperception of environment and patient\u2019s own history). Hardcastle\nclaims that to the extent to which these components are ignored by the\ncommonsense conception of pain, to that extent it\u2019s inadequate.\nMoreover, on her view, it is a fatal mistake to take this subjective\nsensation of pain as the nature of pain because she thinks that a\nbiologically more realistic objective understanding of pain involving\nthe various systems processing nociceptive information will serve our\nscientific purposes much better and the commonsense understanding of\npain should follow that.\n\nJennifer Corns (2015) critically discusses both Dennett\u2019s and\nHardcastle\u2019s eliminativism about pain, and argues that we need\nto make a distinction between scientific eliminativism and traditional\neliminativism (about folk concepts). She argues that even if a case\nmay be made for scientific eliminativism about pain as a natural kind\n(see her 2012), nothing follows about eliminating the folk concept of\npain in so far as the latter serves a variety of useful functions in\nordinary life.\n\nThere are other ways of being eliminativist about pains having to do\nwith the nature of qualia or the alleged existence of apparent\nphenomenal objects. Some philosophers, feeling that qualia or\nphenomenal objects cannot be accommodated by an emerging scientific\nnaturalism, tend to conclude that they simply don\u2019t exist as we\nphilosophically conceive of them (Dennett 1988, Rey 1997). This is a\nparticularly vivid worry for intransitive bodily sensations in general\nand for pain in particular, because they seem to impress upon us as if\nin having them we were literally confronted with phenomenal objects\nthat cannot be part of the natural world order. If one comes to the\nconclusion that none of the theories offered has any chance of\nsucceeding in helping us understand how a purely physical world could\ncontain pains, tickles, itches, orgasms, etc., then one way to go is\nto say that they don\u2019t exist \u2014 rather than giving up on\nnaturalism or physicalism. But the issues here are more general,\npertaining to broader concerns in the philosophy of mind.\n",
