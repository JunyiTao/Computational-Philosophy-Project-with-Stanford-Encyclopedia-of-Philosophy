    "main_text": "Arendt\u2019s Theory of Judgment || Judgment and Kant\u2019s Aesthetics\n5.4 Judgment and Kant\u2019s Aesthetics\n\n\nThe foregoing account has explored the way in which Arendt attempted\nto connect the activity of thinking to our capacity to judge. To be\nsure, this connection of thinking and judging seems to operate only in\nemergencies, in those exceptional moments where individuals, faced\nwith the collapse of traditional standards, must come up with new ones\nand judge according to their own autonomous values. There is, however,\na second, more elaborated view of judgment which does not restrict it\nto moments of crisis, but which identifies it with the capacity to\nthink representatively, that is, from the standpoint of everyone\nelse. Arendt called this capacity to think representatively an\n\u201cenlarged mentality,\u201d adopting the same terms that Kant\nemployed in his Third Critique to characterize aesthetic judgment. It\nis to this work that we must now turn our attention, since Arendt\nbased her theory of political judgment on Kant\u2019s aesthetics rather\nthan on his moral philosophy.\n\n\nAt first sight this might seem a puzzling choice, since Kant himself\nbased his moral and political philosophy on practical reason and not\non our aesthetic faculties. Arendt, however, claimed that the\nCritique of Judgment contained Kant\u2019s unwritten political\nphilosophy, and that the first part of it, the \u201cCritique of\nAesthetic Judgment,\u201d was the most fruitful basis on which to\nbuild a theory of political judgment, since it dealt with the world of\nappearances from the point of view of the judging spectator and took\nas its starting point the faculty of taste, understood as a faculty of\nconcrete and embodied subjects (BPF, 219\u201320).\n\n\nFor Arendt the capacity to judge is a specifically political ability\ninsofar as it enables individuals to orient themselves in the public\nrealm and to judge the phenomena that are disclosed within it from a\nstandpoint that is relatively detached and impartial. She credits Kant\nwith having dislodged the prejudice that judgments of taste lie\naltogether outside the political realm, since they supposedly concern\nonly aesthetic matters. She believes, in fact, that by linking taste\nto that wider manner of thinking which Kant called an \u201cenlarged\nmentality\u201d the way was opened to a revaluation of judgment as a\nspecific political ability, namely, as the ability to think in the\nplace of everybody else. It is only in Kant\u2019s Critique of\nJudgment that we find a conception of judgment as the ability to\ndeal with particulars in their particularity, that is, without\nsubsuming them under a pre-given universal, but actively searching the\nuniversal out of the particular. Kant formulated this distinction as\nthat between determinant and reflective judgments.\nFor him judgment in general is the faculty of thinking the particular\nas contained under the universal. If the universal, (the rule,\nprinciple, or law) is given, then the judgment which subsumes the\nparticular under it is determinant. If, however, only the particular\nis given and the universal has to be found for it, then the judgment\nis reflective. For Kant determinant judgments were cognitive, while\nreflective judgments were non-cognitive. Reflective judgment is seen\nas the capacity to ascend from the particular to the universal without\nthe mediation of determinate concepts given in advance; it is\nreasoning about particulars in their relation to the universal rather\nthan reasoning about universals in their relation to the\nparticular. In the case of aesthetic judgment this means that one can\nunderstand and apply the universal predicate of beauty only through\nexperiencing a particular object that exemplifies it. Thus, upon\nencountering a flower, a unique landscape, or a particular painting, one\nis able to say that it is an example of beauty, that it possesses\n\u201cexemplary validity.\u201d\n\n\nFor Arendt this notion of exemplary validity is not restricted to\naesthetic objects or to individuals who exemplified certain virtues.\nRather, she wants to extend this notion to events in the past that\ncarry a meaning beyond their sheer enactment, that is, to events that\ncould be seen as exemplary for those who came after. It is here that\naesthetic judgment joins with the retrospective judgment of the\nhistorian. The American and French Revolutions, the Paris Commune, the\nRussian soviets, the German revolutionary councils of 1918\u201319, the\nHungarian uprising of 1956, all these events possess the kind of\nexemplary validity that makes them of universal significance, while\nstill retaining their own specificity and uniqueness. Thus, by\nattending to these events in their particularity the historian or\njudging spectator is able to illuminate their universal import and\nthereby preserve them as \u201cexamples\u201d for posterity.\n\n\nFor Arendt it is the spectators who have the privilege of judging\nimpartially and disinterestedly, and in doing so they exercise two\ncrucial faculties, imagination and common sense.\nImagination is the faculty of representing in one\u2019s mind that which\nhas already appeared to one\u2019s senses. Through the imagination one can\nrepresent objects that are no longer present and thus establish the\ndistance necessary for an impartial judgment. Once this distancing has\noccurred, one is in a position to reflect upon these representations\nfrom a number of different perspectives, and thereby to reach a\njudgment about the proper value of an object.\n\n\nThe other faculty that spectators have to appeal to is common sense or\nsensus communis, since without it they could not share their\njudgments or overcome their individual idiosyncrasies. Kant believed\nthat for our judgments to be valid we must transcend our private or\nsubjective conditions in favor of public and intersubjective ones, and\nwe are able to do this by appealing to our community sense, our\nsensus communis.\n\n\nThe criterion for judgment, then, is communicability, and the\nstandard for deciding whether our judgments are indeed communicable is\nto see whether they could fit with the sensus communis of\nothers. Arendt points out that the emphasis on the communicability of\njudgments of taste, and the correlative notion of an enlarged\nmentality, link up effortlessly with Kant\u2019s idea of a united mankind\nliving in eternal peace. She argues that \u201cIt is by virtue of\nthis idea of mankind, present in every single man, that men are human,\nand they can be called civilized or humane to the extent that this\nidea becomes the principle not only of their judgments but of their\nactions. It is at this point that actor and\nspectator become united; the maxim of the actor and the\nmaxim, the \u2018standard,\u2019 according to which the spectator\njudges the spectacle of the world, become one\u201d (LKPP, 75).\n\n\nIn her reflections on Kant\u2019s Third Critique Arendt acknowledges the\nlinks between the standpoint of the actor and that of the\nspectator. Let us now examine the way in which judgment operates from\nthe standpoint of the actor.\n",
