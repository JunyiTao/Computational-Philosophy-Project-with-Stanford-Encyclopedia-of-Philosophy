    "main_text": "Introduction\n1. Introduction\n\nAround 500 B. C. Heraclitus wrote the following:\n\nEverything flows and nothing abides; everything gives way and nothing\nstays fixed.\n\n\nYou cannot step twice into the same river, for other waters and yet\nothers, go flowing on.\n\nTime is a child, moving counters in a game; the royal power is a\n child\u2019s.[1]\n\n\nTransience is basic, and the present is primary. Those things which\nexist now do not abide. They slip into the past and non-existence,\ndevoured by time, as all experience attests.\n\nA generation or so later we have a classic statement of the opposing\nview by Parmenides:\n\nThere remains, then, but one word by which to express the [true] road:\nIs. And on this road there are many signs that What Is has no\nbeginning and never will be destroyed: it is whole, still, and without\nend. It neither was nor will be, it simply is\u2014now, altogether,\none, continuous\u2026\n\n\nPermanence is basic. No things come to be or, slipping into the past,\ncease to be. Past, present, and future are distinctions not marked in\nthe static Is. Time and becoming are at best secondary, at worst\nillusory, as our understanding of the world confirms.\n\nTurn now to modern times and to a paragraph in Rudolf Carnap\u2019s\nintellectual autobiography (Carnap 1963, pp. 37\u201338):\n\nOnce Einstein said that the problem of the Now worried him seriously.\nHe explained that the experience of the Now means something special\nfor man, something essentially different from the past and the future,\nbut that this important difference does not and cannot occur within\nphysics. That this experience cannot be grasped by science seemed to\nhim a matter of painful but inevitable resignation. I remarked that\nall that occurs objectively can be described in science; on the one\nhand the temporal sequence of events is described in physics; and, on\nthe other hand, the peculiarities of man\u2019s experiences with\nrespect to time, including his different attitude towards past,\npresent, and future, can be described and (in principle) explained in\npsychology. But Einstein thought that these scientific descriptions\ncannot possibly satisfy our human needs; that there is something\nessential about the Now which is just outside the realm of science. We\nboth agreed that this was not a question of a defect for which science\ncould be blamed, as Bergson thought. I did not wish to press the\npoint, because I wanted primarily to understand his personal attitude\nto the problem rather than to clarify the theoretical situation. But I\ndefinitely had the impression that Einstein\u2019s thinking on this\npoint involved a lack of distinction between experience and knowledge.\nSince science in principle can say all that can be said, there is no\nunanswerable question left. But though there is no theoretical\nquestion left, there is still the common human emotional experience,\nwhich is sometimes disturbing for special psychological reasons.\n\n\nThis difference as expressed here between Einstein and Carnap (that\nis, between the Heraclitean and Parmenidean attitude towards time and\nchange) is the subject of this article, which will use modern\nphysics\u2014especially modern spacetime theories\u2014as a set of\nlenses through which it is hoped the riddles of time will come into\nsharper focus. There are many ways, however, to approach these\nquestions. Early in the twentieth century, Anglo-American philosophy\nturned to consideration of language as a way to clarify philosophical\ndisputes. Philosophers of time debated the relations between and the\nrelative primacy of tensed language (concerning the notions of\npresent, past, and future) and tenseless language (concerning the\nrelations of simultaneity and temporal precedence). Our considerations\nof physics will generally, though not completely, skirt linguistic\ndisputes. The reader interested in following these debates can find a\nuseful introduction in the entry on\n time,\n a classic presentation in Gale (1968), a review and discussion in\nTooley (1999), and Dyke (2007 chapter 3, 2013).\n\nOther philosophers have been influenced by analogies between time and\nmodality. The reader interested in this way of thinking about time\nshould consult the article on\n temporal logic.\n The present article will focus on time in physics and the relations\nbetween time and space. Other philosophical approaches focus on the\nprimacy of experience in our understanding of time. The reader\ninterested in these approaches may wish to consult the entry\n the experience and perception of time.\n",
