    "main_text": "Mood, Force and Convention\n4. Mood, Force and Convention\n\n\nNot only does content underdetermine force; content together with\ngrammatical mood does so as well. \u2018You\u2019ll be more punctual in\nthe future\u2019 is in the indicative grammatical mood, but as we\nhave seen, that fact does not determine its force. The same may be\nsaid of other grammatical moods. Although I overhear you utter the\nwords, \u2018shut the door\u2019, I cannot infer yet that you are\nissuing a command. Perhaps instead you are simply describing your own\nintention, in the course of saying, \u201cI intend to shut the\ndoor.\u201d If so, you\u2019ve used the imperative mood without issuing a\ncommand. So too with the interrogative mood: I overhear your words,\n\u2018who is on the phone.\u2019 Thus far I don\u2019t know whether\nyou\u2019ve asked a question, since you may have so spoken in the course of\nstating, \u201cJohn wonders who is on the phone.\u201d Might either\nor both of initial capitalization or final punctuation settle the\nissue? Apparently not: What puzzles Meredith is the following\nquestion: Who is on the phone?\n\n\nMood together with content underdetermine force. On the other hand it\nis a plausible hypothesis that grammatical mood is one of the devices\nwe use (together with contextual clues, intonation, and the like) to\nindicate the force with which we are expressing a content. Understood\nin this weak way, it is unexceptionable to construe the interrogative\nmood as used for asking questions, the imperatival mood as used for\nissuing commands, and so on. So understood, we might go on to ask how\nspeakers indicate the force of their speech acts given that\ngrammatical mood and content cannot be relied on alone to do so.\n",
