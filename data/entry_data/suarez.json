    "preamble": "\n\nFrancisco Su\u00e1rez\n (1548\u20131617)[1]\n was a highly influential philosopher and theologian of the Second\nScholastic (or \u201cEarly Modern Scholasticism\u201d), that is, the\nrevitalized philosophical and theological inquiry of the sixteenth and\nseventeenth centuries, conducted within the tradition shaped by Thomas\nAquinas, Duns Scotus, and other medieval scholastics. While\nSu\u00e1rez is commonly praised for his comprehensive, exhaustive,\nand systematic exposition of more or less everything known in\nphilosophy up to his time (certainly, at any rate, in metaphysics),\nhis achievement in this regard should not be permitted to overshadow\nthe depth, power, and originality of his own ideas. He worked in a\ngreat variety of fields, including metaphysics, natural theology,\nphilosophy of mind, philosophy of action, ethics, political\nphilosophy, and law. In all these areas he made contributions the\ninfluences of which are so widespread and commonplace that they\nsometimes escape notice. Still, it is noteworthy that figures as\ndistinct from one another in place, time, and philosophical\norientation as Leibniz, Grotius, Pufendorf, Schopenhauer, and\nHeidegger, all found reason to cite him as a source of inspiration and\ninfluence. Grotius, for instance, praised the Jesuit doctor as a\ntheologian and philosopher of such depth, breadth, and penetration\nthat \u201che hardly had an equal\u201d (Grotius, Letter of 15\nOctober, 1633; 2001: 194).

    "main_text": "\n1. Life and Works\n\nFrancisco Su\u00e1rez was born in Granada on 5 January 1548, the son\nof Gaspar Su\u00e1rez de Toledo and Antonia V\u00e1zquez de Utiel.\nHe made a famously slow start. Thus, for example, his application to\njoin the Society of Jesus at the age of sixteen was the only one of\nfifty to be rejected: his health was weak and his intellect seemed\nunpromising. After appeal, he was finally admitted to the novitiate,\nbut only as a lowly ranked indiferente\u2014someone whose\npermanent rank within the Society would be determined at a later date.\nEven after being admitted, it took some time\u2014and some\npraying\u2014before Su\u00e1rez's talent for philosophy and\ntheology began to emerge. Eventually, however, they emerged as fully\nand undeniably apparent, and he rose to a position of great\nprofessional and academic\n prominence.[2]\n\nSu\u00e1rez's intellectual landscape was marked by the revival of\nIberian scholasticism, triggered in part by Francisco de Vitoria. His\nworks should therefore, in the first instance, be read as\ncontributions to this far-reaching theological and philosophical\nmovement and research program. The revival was very widespread,\nengaging dozens, if not hundreds, of theologians, not only across\nEurope and in the centers of learning and universities of Iberian\nAmerica (such as Lima, Quito, and Mexico), but as distant from the\nIberian peninsula as Japan, China, the Philippines, India and\nEthiopia. In all these lands philosophically minded missionaries,\nmainly Jesuits, promulgated his\n works.[3]\n Consider as an illustration that the Jesuit missionary Martino\nMartini, based at Hangzhou, even attempted a Chinese translation of\nSu\u00e1rez's great masterpiece, the Metaphysical\nDisputations, in the mid-seventeenth\n century.[4]\n\nSu\u00e1rez was thoroughly educated within the framework of this\nrevival, receiving two years of philosophy and four of theology,\nbefore he himself started teaching at the Jesuit School in Segovia.\nThis first appointment was followed by positions at Avila, Valladolid,\nAlcal\u00e1, Salamanca, the Jesuit School at Rome (the Collegio\nRomano), and, for almost twenty years, at Coimbra, in Portugal. While\nan unsuccessful preacher (his few attempts failed because of his\ntendency to digress into the abstruse points of doctrine, the\nsubtleties of which tended to be lost on his auditors), Su\u00e1rez\nproved to be a dedicated and original teacher, if not always a popular\none. His method departed from the norm: instead of merely repeating\nthe opinions of others, he believed in taking a fresh look at the\nissue under consideration, examining, as he used to say, the very root\nof the problem (Scorraille 2005: I, 156).\n\nLike many of his fellow Jesuits, Su\u00e1rez was frequently accused\nof straying too far and too often from views attributed to Thomas\nAquinas. During Su\u00e1rez's own lifetime and shortly after,\nallusions to a \u201cSuarista\u201d party (here in opposition to the\nThomists) became popular. Su\u00e1rez himself resisted these\ndistinctions as false and as resting on fabricated oppositions. He\ndenied being any sort of \u201cinventor of a new school\u201d or as\n\u201cin opposition to or creating a faction against anybody\u201d\n(Scorraille 2005: I, 310). He also faced opposition within his own\norder, in particular, from the other great theologian of his time,\nGabriel V\u00e1zquez\u2014an opposition which developed into a\nlife-long rivalry and a partisanship which survived their deaths.\n\nBeyond authoring works of highly abstract metaphysics and\nphilosophical theology, Su\u00e1rez wrote a number of polemical\ntracts motivated by the political upheavals of his day. In De\nimmunitate ecclesiastica, written in 1606, he defended\necclesiastical rights against alleged encroachments by the Republic of\nVenice. In Defensio fidei, published in 1613 at the behest of\nthe papal nuncio in Madrid, Decio Caraffa, he offered a response to\nJames I of England's defence of his requirement that Catholic subjects\ntake an oath of fidelity. This work went beyond its original purpose,\nto the point where it provided something close to a full-fledged\ntheory of political power. Seen as undermining the foundations of\nregal absolute rule, it was publicly burned, not only in London at the\nend of 1613, but also the following year in the courtyard of the\nParliament in Paris.\n\nThese unhappy events, though, came towards the end of Su\u00e1rez's\nlife, the last two decades of which were spent in the more peaceful\nsurroundings of Coimbra, then an intellectual hub of the\nrevitalization of scholastic philosophy. Philip II of Spain (Philip I\nof Portugal), who imposed his rule on the whole of the Iberian\npeninsula in 1580, sought to appoint a distinguished theologian to the\nmost eminent university of this new part of the realm. After initially\naccepting Su\u00e1rez's personally tendered apologies, given on\ngrounds of ill-health, Philip reconsidered and then insisted in a\nsecond letter that Su\u00e1rez take up a post in Coimbra. Clearly,\nSu\u00e1rez could not decline. Travels apart, Su\u00e1rez would\nremain in Coimbra until shortly before his death on 25 September 1617,\naged almost seventy, after convalescing for two weeks in Lisbon from\nwhat may have been dysentery.\n\nDuring his working life, Su\u00e1rez was both remarkably prolific\nand industrious (according to Fichter 1940: 327, he wrote about 21\nmillion words, more than twice the output of Thomas Aquinas), not only\nwriting but equally involving himself in all manner of editorial\nmatters. Given his eminence and popularity, almost as soon as\nSu\u00e1rez published a book, unauthorized copies were printed in\nplaces such as Paris, Vienna, Cologne, Geneva, Lyons, and Mainz.\n\nTwenty-two volumes of Su\u00e1rez's works were published, nine of\nthem posthumously under the care of his friend Baltasar Alvarez.\nWithin this corpus most of the philosophical interest has gone to the\nmonumental Disputationes metaphysicae (Metaphysical\nDisputations, 1597), a work in which Su\u00e1rez collects and\nthoughtfully assesses the views of numerous authors, on a vast array\nof problems, before offering his own solutions; De legibus\n(1612), where he outlines his natural law theory; and De\nanima (1621), where he offers a critical exposition of\nAristotelian approaches to life and cognition.\n\nA number of writings have been lost, including his commentaries on\nAristotle, which Su\u00e1rez had used for his classroom\npresentations during his first tenure at Salamanca. His oeuvre has\nbeen collected, most recently in the 28 volumes (including indexes),\nand published in Paris between 1856 and 1878 (Opera omnia).\nWe also have a collection of responsa (Conselhos e\nPareceres).\n2. The Metaphysical Disputations\n\nIt is scarcely credible that there is no complete English translation\nof Suarez's great masterpiece of metaphysics, the Metaphysical\n Disputations[5]\u2014though,\n happily, we do possess a translation into\n Spanish.[6]\n It is a work of surpassing sophistication and comprehensiveness,\nserving at once as a kind of authoritative epitome of ancient\n and[7]\n medieval metaphysics and as a free-standing, incisive, and original\ndiscussion of all topics pertaining to metaphysics, conceived,\naccording to Su\u00e1rez's understanding of this subject, as the\nstudy of being. As Schopenhauer remarked, the work is \u201can\nauthentic compendium of the whole scholastic tradition\u201d.\nExtending to fifty-four disputations, each in its own right\neffectively a dedicated monograph on a discrete topic, the work\ncontains 7,709 references, citing some 245 authors, led in typical\nscholastic fashion by Aristotle, who receives 1,735 references,\nfollowed by Thomas Aquinas, with whose philosophy Su\u00e1rez\nretains an animating sympathy, who receives 1,008 (Iturrioz 1949).\nStill, Su\u00e1rez is hardly beholden to Aristotle, Thomas Aquinas,\nor any other thinker: he is, as his Metaphysical Disputations\nmakes manifest, a thinker of fearless originality and innovation.\n\nAs shown in this work, Su\u00e1rez has a conception of metaphysics\nwhich initially seems much more narrowly focused than that subject as\nit is conceived today. Still, even given this narrower concentration,\nmetaphysics as practiced by Su\u00e1rez opens itself into many of\nthe topics commanding the attention of current day metaphysicians. His\navowedly narrow focus results from his taking metaphysics to have but\none, exclusive object: \u201cthe study of being insofar as it is real\nbeing\u201d (DM I\n 1.26).[8]\n In this sense, Su\u00e1rez understands metaphysics in a broadly\nAristotelian manner as the study of being and its causes. This study\nwas rechristened in the seventeenth century as\n \u201contology\u201d,[9]\n literally, the study of to on, or being, in view of the then\nbroadening sweep of metaphysics whereby it came to include the\ninvestigation of minds and bodies, causation, numbers, identity and\nother relations, properties and propositions, modality, and,\neventually, the nature of abstract entities, including fictional ones.\nRelative to this broader conception, ontology, as the study of being,\nseems highly specific. Still, this appearance is misleading,\nespecially where Su\u00e1rez is concerned, since he addresses most\nof the topics on this list in one way or another, if in an idiom alien\nto those unschooled in Aristotelianism. For, as it turns out, he\nunderstands \u201cthe study of being\u201d and its causes very\nbroadly indeed.\n\nThis is partly because he looks at being as a subject matter requiring\nconsideration of the categories; of terms or properties which\ntranscend the categories; of infinite and finite beings; and\neven\u2014as indispensable but falling outside the remit of the\nmetaphysician proper\u2014the study of beings of reason (entia\nrationis), that is, beings which do not in fact exist, such as\nfictitious entities, privations, and various forms of abstraction, all\nof which, Su\u00e1rez insists, force themselves into view, despite\ntheir non-existence.\n\nAltogether, then, Su\u00e1rez's Metaphysical Disputations\ncomprises fifty-four questions, or topics for discussion, constituting\nseven unequal sections, ordered first under a general division of\nbeing in general (DM I\u2013XXVII) and then being as divided\ninto infinite and finite being (DM\n XXVIII\u2013LIII):[10]\n\nThe nature of metaphysics (DM I)\nThe transcendentals (DM II\u2013XI)\nThe causes of being (DM XII\u2013XXVII)\nFinite and infinite being (DM XXVIII\u2013XXXI)\nSubstance and accident, pertaining to finite beings (DM\nXXXII\u2013XXXVIII)\nThe nine categories of accident (DM\nXXXIX\u2013LIII)\nReal and conceptual being (DM LIV)\n\n\nThe first and last of these, which in different ways stand outside of\nthe subject matter proper of the Metaphysical Disputations,\nwe have already characterized briefly.\n\nThe second topic (DM II\u2013XI) treats transcendental\nterms, including being (ens), but also good (bonum)\nand true (veritas), which are transcendental in the sense\nthat they may be predicated of beings in any category (a quality is a\nbeing, an ens, just as a substance is an ens, and so\non for every category of being). Every being is, as such, according to\nSu\u00e1rez, one; hence being one is predicated across the\nfull range of categories as well. So, too, but less obviously and more\ncontroversially, according to Su\u00e1rez, every single being is\nsomething true, in some suitably ontological sense of true\n(as in \u201ctrue propositions are simply facts\u201d) and also\nsomething good. So, these terms require dedicated treatment at the\nhands of the metaphysician.\n\nThe remaining sections of the Metaphysical Disputations are\ncentrally and recognizably discussions of kinds of being: infinite\nbeing, that is, God; finite being, what is created by God; and then\nthe nature and features of finite beings, again as delineated by a\ntheory of categories: substance and accident, and then all of the\nkinds of accident there may be. We will restrict ourselves mainly to\n(3), the causes of being, since doing so provides a clear picture of\nthe character of Suarez's inquiry in the Metaphysical\nDisputations. \n\nBefore doing so, however, because of its relative obscurity and\ninaccessibility to present-day readers, it will be helpful to offer a\ncomplete outline of the fifty-four disputations.\n\nThe nature of metaphysics (DM I)\nBeing as such (DM II)\n\n\nThe transcendentals (DM III\u2013XI)\n\n\nThe attributes of being in general (DM III)\nUnity (DM IV\u2013VII)\n\n\nTranscendental unity in general (DM IV)\nIndividual unity and individuation (DM V)\nUniversals and unity (DM VI)\nDistinguishing various kinds of unity (DM VII)\n\nTruth (DM VIII\u2013IX)\n\n\nTruth as an attribute of being (DM VIII)\nFalsity (DM IX)\n\nGoodness (DM X\u2013XI)\n\n\nTranscendental goodness (DM X)\nEvil (DM XI)\n\n\nThe causes of being (DM XII\u2013XXVII)\n\n\nThe causes of being in general (DM XII)\nThe material cause (DM XIII\u2013XIV)\n\n\nThe material cause of substance (DM XIII)\nThe material cause of accidents (DM XIV)\n\nThe formal cause (DM XV\u2013XVI)\n\n\nThe formal cause of substance (DM XV)\nThe formal cause of accident (DM XVI)\n\nThe efficient cause (DM XVII\u2013XXII)\n\n\nThe efficient cause in general (DM XVII)\nThe requisites of causality (DM XVIII)\nNecessary and contingent causes (DM XIX)\nThe first cause (DM XX\u2013XXII)\n\n\nCreation: the first action of the first cause (DM\nXX)\nConservation: the second action of the first cause (DM\nXXI)\nConcurrence: the third action of the first cause (DM\nXXII)\n\n\nThe final cause (DM XXIII\u2013XXIV)\n\n\nThe final cause in general (DM XXIII)\nThe ultimate final cause (DM XXIV)\n\nThe exemplar cause (DM XXV)\nProperties common to all causes (DM XXVI\u2013XXVII)\n\n\nThe relation of causes to their effects (DM XXVI)\nThe relation of causes to one another (DM XXVII)\n\n\n\nBeing, infinite and finite (DM XXVIII\u2013LIII)\n\n\nThe distinction between finite and infinite being (DM\nXXVIII)\nInfinite being (DM XXIX\u2013XXX)\n\n\nThe existence of the first being, as known by natural reason\n(DM XXIX)\nThe nature of the first being, as known by natural reason\n(DM XXX)\n\nFinite being (DM XXXI\u2013LIII)\n\n\nThe essence and individuation of finite beings (DM\nXXXI)\nThe distinction between substance and accident (DM\nXXXII)\nCreated substance (DM XXXIII\u2013XXXVI)\n\n\nCreated substance in general (DM XXXIII)\nPrimary substance (the suppositum) (DM\nXXXIV)\nImmaterial substance (DM XXXV)\nMaterial substance (DM XXXVI)\n\nAccidents in general (DM XXXVII\u2013XXXVIII)\n\n\nThe nature of accidents (DM XXXVII)\nThe relation of accident to substance (DM XXXVIII)\n\nThe nine categories of accident (DM XXXIX\u2013LIV)\n\n\nThe nine highest genera (DM XXXIX)\nQuantity (DM XL\u2013XLII)\n\n\nContinuous quantity (DM XL)\nDiscrete quantity (DM XLI)\n\nQuality (DM XLII\u2013XLVI)\n\n\nQuality in general (DM XLII)\nPotentiality and actuality (DM XLIII)\nHabits (DM XLIV)\nContrariety among qualities (DM XLV)\nIntensity of quality (DM XLVI)\n\nRelation (DM XLVII)\nAction (DM XLVIII)\nPassion (DM XLIX)\nTime (DM L)\nPlace (DM LI)\nPosition (DM LII)\nHaving (DM LIII)\n\n\n\nBeings of reason (entia rationis) (DM LIV)\n\n\nAs is clear from this list of topics, the Metaphysical\nDisputations covers a great deal of territory. In fact, again, if\nin a different idiom, Su\u00e1rez traverses virtually all of the\ntopics of concern to metaphysicians practicing in the periods which\nfollowed him, down even to the present day.\n2.1 Su\u00e1rez's Nominalism\n\nSu\u00e1rez conducts his metaphysical inquiries against the backdrop\nof a pervasive commitment to nominalism, according to which only\nindividuals exist: all extra-mental entities are singular and\nindividual (DM VI 1.2; cf. DM V passim). Since\nwhatever is singular and individual is not common, it follows, in\nSu\u00e1rez\u2019s preferred idiom, that \u2018formal unity, as it\nexists in a thing, is incommunicable\u2019 (DM VI 1.11).\nThis is to say, then, that nothing extra-mental is fully shared by\nmore than one being; hence, there are no universals, where these are\nconceived as mind- and language-independent entities capable of being\nwholly present in more than one place at one time.\n\nThose approaching Su\u00e1rez\u2019s works for the first time,\nhowever, are confronted with not a few passages in which he seems to\nassert exactly the opposite. For instance:\n\n\nThings which are denominated universals truly exist in reality (res\nquae universales denominatur vere in re existunt). First it must be\nestablished that those things we denominate universal and common are\nreal and exist in things themselves; for we do not fabricate them\nmentally, but rather apprehend them and understand them to be in\nthings, and we produce definitions, construct demonstrations, and we\nseek knowledge of them thus conceived (DM VI 2.1).\n\n\nSo, some work is required to come to terms with his approach to this\nissue. The effort required is, however, productive, since once one\nappreciates Su\u00e1rez\u2019s nominalism, many otherwise obscure\nremarks he makes become immediately intelligible.\n\nIn order to come to terms with Su\u00e1rez\u2019s position, the\nfirst point to appreciate is that a nominalist of his day faced an\nimmediate, inescapable problem. It is, in fact, the very problem\nmentioned by Su\u00e1rez in the passage cited: Aristotelian science\npresupposes a conception of the organization of knowledge according to\nwhich a science must proceed via demonstrations, that is, deductions,\nor logically valid syllogisms, the premises of which are necessary,\nbetter known than their conclusions, and universal in scope\n(cf. Aristotle, APo. 71b16\u201325, 77b5\u201373a6; Met.\n981a5\u201330, 1006a6\u201318, 1039b27\u20131040a7). If the premises are universal in\nscope, however, then that is presumably due to their featuring\nuniversals as terms. This is why, in part, Su\u00e1rez is\ninclined to take the claims of realism about universals\nseriously. Like others of his time, he embraces an Aristotelian theory\nof demonstration and so must confront its evident commitment to\nrealism.\n\nThe easy way to address this commitment, of course, would simply be to\nembrace realism about universals. Su\u00e1rez does not take the easy\nroute. Instead, when he considers an argument for the existence of\nuniversals conceived as mind- and language-independent entities (in,\nfor instance DM VI 1.4), he offers in response the\n\u2018true and contrary opinion\u2019 (DM VI 1.8\u201312).\nThis is that in all real things, there is a formal unity per se,\nbelonging to each essence or nature (DM VI 1.8). As a result,\nevery individual is not only one in number but one essentially. Formal\nunity is distinguished from singular unity by reason (per\nrationem) (DM VI 1.9). An individual unity does not\nbelong to some common essence just by itself; something must be added,\nnamely formal unity. That is to say, then, nothing is a \u03c6, a human\nbeing say, merely in virtue of its being one thing; that one thing\nmust have in addition some definite formal character, namely\nbeing-\u03c6. The claim that something is a unity tells us nothing\ndeterminate about an individual beyond that it is some one thing or\nother. By contrast, formal unity takes us directly to an essence,\nwithout any addition, even by reason. This is what Su\u00e1rez means\nwhen he says that formal unity and singular unity are not one and the\nsame. Even so, this difference is not given by the extra-mental\nindividual (ex parte rei), but by reason alone (sed\nratione tantum) (DM VI 1.10)\n\nThe common essence and the singular entity are distinguished, then,\nnot on the basis of the nature of the thing (ex natura rei),\nbut by reason; hence, again, there is no world-given distinction\nbetween something\u2019s existing as an individual and its existing\nas this or that kind of individual: reason makes this distinction.\nThis permits Su\u00e1rez to insist that formal unity, as it exists\nin a thing, is incommunicable (unitas formalis prout in re\nexistit, incommunicabilis est) (DM VI 1.11). The formal\nunity marches in step with the nature of a thing, and in real things\nthere is no common nature; instead, \u2018nature and essence are\nmultiplied as many times as there are individuals\u2019 (DM\nVI 1. 12). So, while formal unity at the individual level is mind- and\nlanguage-independent, formal unity as common is not: it is supplied by\nthe operations of the mind.\n\nSo, why does he say, then, that \u2018things which are denominated\nuniversals truly exist in reality (res quae universales\ndenominatur vere in re existunt; DM VI 2.1)? The crucial\nand characteristically subtle coloration comes from the word\n\u2018denominated\u2019 (denominatur). Su\u00e1rez is\nthinking, in fact, that things called \u2018universals\u2019 really\ndo exist\u2014but what they turn out to be are extrinsic\ndenominations, that is, in this case, features of individuals brought\nforth by the workings of the mind. He says, for instance:\n\n\nUniversals in reality are not separate from singulars. Secondly, it\nmust be supposed that these things or natures which we denominate\nuniversals, are not really separated from singular things, since, as\nhas been demonstrated above, every thing which exists is necessarily\nsingular and individual \u2026 (DM VI. 2. 2).\n\n\nHis position, then, is that only individuals exist, but that a\ncollection of individual \u03c6-things can be\u2014and indeed are in\nscientific demonstrations\u2014regarded as having a common nature,\nbeing-\u03c6. This is just to say, for example, that the universal\npredicate \u2018\u2026 is a human\u2019 is applied equally and\nrightly to Peter and Paula by a discerning mind; but that is not to\nsay that there is a universal in which they equally partake.\n\nThat this common predication is \u2018rightly\u2019 made derives\nfrom the fact, according to Su\u00e1rez, that there is an objective\nsimilarity obtaining between Peter and Paula\u2014this similarity is\nnot imposed by the mind, but is rather reflected in the mental\napprehension ascribing a common predicate to them. This permits him to\nsay, then:\n\n\nAnd it follows from these considerations, first, that although some\nindividuals may be, a parte rei, formally one apart from the\nthinking of the mind, nevertheless several individuals which are said\nto be of the same nature are not one thing with the true unity which\nis in the things, but only either by way of being grounded or through\nthe intellect \u2026 It follows, secondly, that it is one thing to\nspeak of formal unity and another thing to speak of the community of\nthis unity, for unity is in things, as has been insisted; community,\nhowever, properly and strictly is not in things, for no unity which\nexists in things is common, as we have shown, but there is in singular\nthings a certain similarity in their formal unities in which their\ncommunity is grounded, which community the intellect is able attribute\nto such a nature, as conceived by it, which similarity is not properly\nunity, since it does not represent the undividedness of the entities\non which it is based but only their congruence or their relation or\ntheir co-existence with one another (DM VI 1.12).\n\n\nHis view is, then, nominalistic. Since, however, the word\n\u2018nominalist\u2019 is used in different ways by different\nphilosophers, and is, indeed, used rather austerely by some of the\nphilosophers with whom Su\u00e1rez was acquainted, we should specify\nprecisely his variety of nominalism, in a single sentence: a universal\nis a being of reason (an ens rationis), properly regarded as\nan extrinsic denomination grounded in the intrinsic individual formal\nunities of mind- and language-independent things (res), as\nmediated by non-formally representing intelligible species related to\ntheir objects predicatively by some manner of analogy of attribution.\nThat the representations are non-formal is, in this context, just to\nsay that they represent their objects not as universals, but as\nindividuals regarded as being the same, which manner of regarding them\nis grounded in a real fact about them, namely that they are\nobjectively similar.[11]\n\n\nOne may wish to question whether Su\u00e1rez's position is\ndefensible. What is required for understanding his conception of\nmetaphysics, however, is recognizing that this is his position. For\nbetter or worse, Su\u00e1rez is a nominalist, in the sense\nspecified. His investigation of the causes of being respects this\nconstraint throughout.\n2.2 The Causes of Being\n\nSu\u00e1rez devotes a great deal of energy to an investigation of\ntopics pertaining to causation, broadly construed. This is because he\nis interested in the first instance, as a metaphysician, in an\ninvestigation into the causes of being (DM XII\u2013XXVII),\nan approach to metaphysics colored by the writings of Aristotle, the\nbroad idiom of which Su\u00e1rez, in common with other scholastics,\nembraces. More specifically, first, in keeping with the Aristotelian\nconception of science (scientia), Su\u00e1rez supposes that\nto understand anything we must grasp and understand the causes of that\nthing; so, as a special case, to understand being (ens) we\nmust investigate and understand the causes of being, taken in its most\ngeneral and abstract aspect. Second, as he conceives it, causal\ninquiry proceeds within the context of an Aristotelian four-causal\nframework of explanatory adequacy: material, formal, efficient, and\nfinal. Su\u00e1rez supposes, however, that to execute his study of\nthe causes of being, it is first of all incumbent on him to understand\nprecisely what it is for something to be a cause, but then\nalso further, as a distinct matter, what it is for a cause to\nexercise its causality.\n\nAs Su\u00e1rez approaches these issues, the question of\nwhat a cause is differs crucially from the question of\nhow a cause actively brings about its effects\u2014two\nquestions which were often run together in later periods of\nphilosophy. According to Su\u00e1rez, one might truly say, for\ninstance, that a doctor is a cause of health, without yet\nunderstanding the precise activity of the doctor in virtue of which he\nis a cause, how it is that his activity on a specific occasion\nqualifies as an instance of healing\u2014how, that is, the cause\nexercises its causality (DM XII 2.13). To have a full\nunderstanding of the science of medicine, then, one must understand\nthe causes of health and, further, how those causes exercise their\ncausality, that is, how those causes manage to have the effects they\nhave. So too, then, with the causes of being. To understand being, we\nmust understand what brings being about, in the broadest possible\nsense\u2014what is responsible for being (ens). Thereafter,\nwe must come to terms with what causes individual beings\n(entia) to come into existence, or to change their manner of\nexistence once they have come into existence. This involves reflection\non all the causes of being, however many and of whatever kinds they\nmay be. It further involves reflection on the narrower question of how\nthe causes of being exercise their causality\u2014how precisely, that\nis, such causes come to be responsible for being. This, then,\nlicenses, or indeed requires, Su\u00e1rez to engage in a thorough\nexamination of causation itself.\n\nThe fifteen disputations in which Su\u00e1rez explores these matters\n(DM XII\u2013XXVII) consequently contain extended, intricate\ndiscussions of each of the four causes, as well as detailed\nexplorations of how each cause effects its causality on a specific\noccasion. In general, he urges, a cause is a sort of origin or source\n(a principium). But what sort of source or origin? Not every\nsource or origin qualifies as a cause (a journey from Athens to\nJerusalem begins in Athens, but Athens is not the cause of this\njourney). Su\u00e1rez notes that certain of his contemporaries\nsought to characterize the relevant sort of principle simply as that\non which other things depend as such (DM XII 2.4: causa\nest id a quo aliquid per se\n pendet);[12]\n but he sets aside this formulation in favor of one which, if\ninitially odder sounding, is more contentful and characteristic of the\nidiom within which he works. He thinks that a cause is the sort of\nprinciple that \u201cin its own right imparts being to something\nelse\u201d (causa est principium per se influens esse in\naliud: DM XII 2.4). One reason his approach sounds odd\nis that talk of one thing's \u201cimparting being\u201d, or perhaps\neven of one thing's \u201cflowing being into\u201d (influens\nesse) another thing, is initially hard to fathom. This fact does\nnot escape Su\u00e1rez, however. Indeed, he calls attention to this\nvery word \u201cflowing\u201d (influens) and glosses it\nsimply as \u201cgiving\u201d or \u201ccommunicating\u201d being to\nanother thing (dandi vel communicandi esse alteri). So at the\nmost general level, a cause is the sort of principle or source which\ncan impart being to another being\u2014that is to say, then, that a\ncause is something that makes something exist or makes something\nalready existing come to exist in a new and different way.\n\nOf course, this generic formulation by itself tells us very little,\nbut that too is by design. On the overarching approach favored by\nSu\u00e1rez, causation is initially very broadly characterized: a\ncause, taken most generically, is responsible for the existence or\nfeatures of some being beyond itself; and an exercise of causality is\nprecisely the activity by which a cause imparts existence to another,\nby creating it, or altering its features once it exists. As he moves\nthrough each of the four ways one thing might be responsible for the\nexistence or features of another, Su\u00e1rez brings content and\nspecificity to his first generic notion, by explicating the various\nways each of four causes manages to impart being to some being beyond\nitself.\n\nIn fact, this general approach to causation encourages Su\u00e1rez\nto treat the subject so broadly that, for instance, he devotes an\nentire disputation (DM XIX, of some 39,000 words), one of the\nsix disputations given over to efficient causation (DM\nXVII\u2013XXII), to the topics of necessity and contingency, fate and\nluck, freedom of the will, and issues pertaining to God's freedom in\ncreation. He even indulges in this disputation on efficient causation\nin a discussion of the question of whether there could be contingency\nin the world if\u2014(in his view) contrary to modal fact\u2014God\nwere necessitated to create the world as it is. This discussion offers\na good example of the richly metaphysical character of Su\u00e1rez's\ngeneral philosophical outlook: he very often engages not only in\ncounterfactual reasoning, but in counterfactual reasoning featuring\ncounterfactuals with impossible antecedents. Such reasoning permits\nhim to make fine-grained, highly intensional discriminations that\nwould otherwise be inaccessible to him. Thus, with respect to the\ncurrent illustration, he concludes that there could indeed be\ncontingency in the world if it were the case that God, per\nimpossibile, was necessitated to create the world just as we find\nit. This finding, whether or not ultimately defensible, then permits\nhim to make further, finer-grained distinctions among different types\nof contingency, and so also among different types of modality:\nphysical, nomic, and logical.\n\nWhen focusing on the nature of the individual causes seriatim,\nSu\u00e1rez begins by dividing the four causes into the\ninternal and external (or intrinsic and extrinsic;\nDM XII 3.19). Formal and material causes are internal,\nwhereas efficient and final causes are external. A thing's matter\naccounts for the material features of the thing which it constitutes,\nwithout actually being that thing; and the same again for the\nform. So, for example, a statue is malleable because it is made of\nbronze, though that quantity of bronze in virtue of which it is\nmalleable is not identical with the statue, since it may exist when\nthe statue does not; and the bronze statue is a statue of Hermes\nbecause of its form, which, like its matter, can be readily thought of\nas a constituent of the statue without being identified with the\nstatue, which is itself neither exhaustively matter nor form, but a\ncomposite of both. In Su\u00e1rez's terms, then, matter and form\nconform to the general definition of a cause, because each in its own\nway infuses something beyond itself\u2014the statue\u2014with its\nexistence and features. Each manages to give some manner of being\n(esse) to the statue, even they are in different ways\ninternal to the entity whose being they influence. By contrast,\nneither of the statue's external causes\u2014the efficient cause,\nthat is, the sculptor who sculpts the bronze so as to give it this or\nthat form, and its final cause, that is, the goal or reason the\nsculptor has in view when sculpting\u2014is a constituent of the\nstatue. They are thus external causes in Su\u00e1rez's terminology.\n\n\nWithin this overarching framework, Su\u00e1rez proceeds to\ninvestigate each of the four causes minutely. One immediately\nappreciates when studying his treatment of these issues a level of\ndetail and sophistication plainly lacking in many of the accounts of\ncausation written in the several centuries after his death. It is\ndifficult to believe, for example, that Hume's modest and cursory\nsuggestion, in An Enquiry Concerning Human Understanding,\nthat a cause is \u201can object, followed by another, and where all\nthe objects similar to the first, are followed by objects similar to\nthe second\u201d (Hume 1993 [1748], II.7) is an advance in nuance or\nsophistication over Su\u00e1rez's the protracted discussions of the\nMetaphysical Disputations.\n\nHowever that may be, one is confronted in this work with a discussion\nwhich is by any measure rich, intricate, and comprehensive. Each of\nthe four causes receives it own extended treatment in the sections of\nthe Metaphysical Disputations dedicated to the causes of\nbeing (DM XII\u2013XXVII). To come to see the character of\nthese discussions, we may reflect especially on Suarez's presentation\nof two of the four causes in particular, one internal and one\nexternal. His treatments of formal and final causes are in any case of\nspecial note, since each in its own way represents a departure and\ndevelopment from the very Aristotelian tradition which forms the basic\nfoundation for Su\u00e1rez's metaphysics.\n2.3 Formal Causation and the Existence of Substantial Forms\n\nSu\u00e1rez's treatment of formal causation provides a good example.\nHe begins his treatment of the formal cause in his typical fashion, by\nshowing it conforms to his overarching causal framework. A standard\ntextbook account of formal causation familiar to Su\u00e1rez holds\nsimply that \u201cform in an internal cause that gives being to a\nthing\u201d (causa intrinseca quae dat esse rei: DM\nXII 3.3). This approach certainly comports with his basic framework\nfor causation, at least in general terms. Su\u00e1rez is, however,\nunwilling to adopt this formula unqualifiedly, since he thinks the\nother internal cause, matter, has a causal efficacy of its own, not\nparasitic on the causality of form. Thus, when he comes to give an\naccount of the most significant kind of formal cause, the substantial\nform, he offers the following definition:\n\n\nx is a substantial form =df x is a definite\nsimple and incomplete substance, which, as the actuality of matter,\nconstitutes with it the essence of composite substance (forma est\nsubstantia quaedam simplex et incompleta, quae ut actus materiae cum\nea constituit essentiam substantiae compositae: DM XV\n5.1)\n\n\nSu\u00e1rez here insists that it is the form together with the\nmatter (cum ea) which constitutes the essence of a\nsubstantial composite. He thinks, then, that matter has, so to speak,\nits own independent causal pathway as an internal cause. Even though\nthe substantial form is the actuality of the matter, this does not\ndeprive matter of its causal efficacy. In this respect, he parts\ncompany from a good many of his contemporaries and predecessors, who\nhad opted for the simpler formulation, often by representing the\ncausal efficacy of matter as somehow parasitic on the causality of the\nform.\n\nIf this shows some development by acknowledging the independent role\nof matter in causation and explanation, it is also likely to appear\nretrograde in its basic appeal to the apparatus of formal causation.\nIndeed, in Metaphysical Disputations XV Su\u00e1rez takes\nup in detail a question about substantial forms which has a special\nresonance because of the contumely poured on this doctrine by\nphilosophers writing in the centuries after his death, many of whom\nwere self-consciously concerned to distance themselves from the entire\nidea of formal causation\u2014a doctrine they regarded as noxious,\nobscurantist, and explanatorily vacuous. Locke, for instance, in his\nEssay Concerning Human Understanding, derided his\npredecessors for their \u201cfruitless Enquiries after substantial\nForms, wholly unintelligible, and whereof we have scarce so much as\nany obscure, or confused Conception in general.\u201d (Locke 1976\n[1690]:\n 3.6.10)[13]\n\n\nLocke's reaction was in many ways typical of the general tenor of\npost-scholastic rejections of substantial form in that he founded his\ncharges of unintelligibility largely on epistemic considerations: the\nfruitlessness of substantial forms, he thinks, is shown most readily\nby their empirical inadequacy. We have, he complains, no experience of\nthem at all, and therefore, no idea of what we might be taking\nourselves to be positing. This is in part because Locke conflates the\nnotion of substance with that of substratum, which he derides\nas a something \u201cI know not what, [introduced] to support those\nideas we call accidents\u201d (Locke 1976 [1690]: 2.23.15).\n\nIt is striking that Su\u00e1rez, a staunch defender of substantial\nforms, in a way agrees the Locke's dominant complaint. At any rate, he\nthinks that we might have only two reasons for accepting substantial\nforms:\n\n\nThe first reason for doubting that substantial forms exist is that\nthey cannot be known by any experience (ratio dubitandi est primo\nquia formae substantiales nullo experimento cognosci possunt);\nnor are they necessary [to account for] the actions and differences in\nthings which we do experience. Therefore, lacking any [sufficient]\nreason, they are not to be introduced (DM XV 1.1).\n\n\nThere are two distinct succinctly stated arguments here. First, if we\ncan have no experience of substantial forms, we have reason for\ndoubting their existence. Second, if we have no need to posit them to\nexplain the phenomena we do experience, then, again, we have reason to\ndoubt their existence. These arguments are clearly connected, though\ndiscrete, in that the second becomes dialectically salient precisely\nwhen the first is endorsed. If one grants that we have reason to doubt\nthe existence of substantial forms insofar as we never experience them\ndirectly, the question immediately arises as to whether we have some\nindirect, non-experiential reason for granting them. The proponent of\nthe second argument contends that we do not.\n\nWhat is striking is that Su\u00e1rez simply grants the first premise\nof the first argument, and so effectively cedes the point on which\nLocke later laid so much emphasis: we have no direct experience of\nsubstantial forms. Hence, he agrees, we have some reason for doubting\ntheir existence. Needless to say, however, Su\u00e1rez does not join\nLocke or any of the many philosophers who followed him in finally\ncasting substantial forms aside. This is because he roundly rejects\nthe first premise of the second argument, according to which it is not\nnecessary to posit substantial forms to explain other data known to us\nthrough experience. Su\u00e1rez counters that, on the contrary,\nsubstantial forms have significant explanatory work to do. He\nconcludes, then, that to the extent that this is so, we have reason to\ncountenance their existence after all.\n\nHis argument for the existence of substantial forms is thus\neffectively abductive: for some range of data or phenomena,\nSu\u00e1rez contends, some explanation is required, and the only,\nor, more weakly, the best, explanation of these phenomena involves a\ncommitment to substantial forms. So, his general argument schema is\nclear: (i) some phenomenon \u03c6 requires explanation; (ii) the only\nor best explanation of \u03c6 is the existence of substantial forms;\nhence, (iii) there are substantial forms. The argument thus assumes\nthat the phenomena in question both obtain and are not primitive, that\nis, that we are confronted with some data for which some form of\nexplanation is both wanting and available.\n\nWhat are these phenomena? In Metaphysical Disputations XV,\nSu\u00e1rez appeals most forcefully to the following four: first, we\nfind accidents unified in a single subject (DM XV 1.7);\nsecond, as a related matter, we observe various properties in a single\nsubject, both essential and accidental, standing in superordination\nand subordination relations to one another (DM XV 1.14);\nthird, we experience various entities coming into and going out of\nexistence, suffering, in his preferred idiom, generation and\ncorruption (DM XV 1.7); and finally, we observe various\nphysical systems, including especially (but not only) living beings\nmanifesting equilibrium states which they maintain unless put under\npressure, and to which they return when a pressure applied has been\nrelieved (DM XV 1.8).\n\nThe arguments for these claims are varied, but in each case show great\nsensitivity to matters of systematicity and unity. To explicate the\nfirst, by way of illustration, Su\u00e1rez appeals to the simple\nthought that there are privileged unities in our world. He thinks it\nplain\u2014and does not dally to offer an argument\u2014that, for\ninstance, Socrates is a unified being, who exists in a specific place\nand time, that he is a human being who eats, sleeps, grows, diminishes\nand dies. By contrast, the mereological sum of Socrates, the\nPinturricchio frescoes in the Bufalini Chapel in Rome, and a volume of\nwater equal to one pint in somewhere in the Indian Ocean is no such\nunity. There is, of course, a mereological sum of these three diverse\nitems; but this sum does not exhibit the form of unity we observe in\nSocrates. By the same token, Socrates is himself a mereological sum of\nvarious atoms. Su\u00e1rez takes it for granted that he is\nalso a mind- and language-independent privileged unity. If he\nis right, then this further fact is either primitive or explicable.\nSu\u00e1rez thinks it explicable rather than primitive and tenders\nthe existence of substantial forms\u2014in this case the form of\nbeing a human being\u2014as the appropriate explanatory posit.\n\nNeedless to say, this last step requires further amplification and\ndefence if it is to be at all credible. Again, however, one can see,\nat a bare minimum, that Su\u00e1rez has fully anticipated objections\nto his views later taken as decisive; yet many of those unreflectively\nsatisfied by those later objections seem to show no awareness of his\nanticipations.\n2.4 Final Causation\n\nIn offering his spirited and protracted defense of substantial forms,\nand of formal causation more generally, Su\u00e1rez shows himself\naware of the need to articulate and defend core features of his\nbroadly Aristotelian framework, including some which later came in for\nharsh criticism. Indeed, in the case of substantial forms, these\ncriticisms were finding voice already during his lifetime; he was, for\ninstance, an older contemporary of Descartes (b. 1596), who was twenty\nyears old when Su\u00e1rez died in 1617. Descartes simply reports\nwithout argument that substantial forms are \u201ca philosophical\nbeing unknown to me\u201d (Letter to Morin, 12 September 1638;\nDescartes 1984: 122). Because he is alert to such concerns, and\naddresses them directly, Su\u00e1rez appears to many historians of\nphilosophy as a sort of bridge figure between scholastic and early\nmodern philosophy. That may or may not be so, depending on the\nprinciples of periodization presupposed by those offering this sort of\njudgment. What is clearly true, however, is that he very often\ndevelops Aristotelian theses in a manner betraying a willingness to\nabandon those features of Aristotelianism which were to come in for\nthe harshest treatment by philosophers subsequent to him.\n\nOne such thesis pertains to his attitude towards teleological\ncausation. He endorses its centrality to his framework, but recognizes\nthat it requires articulation and defense. In the Metaphysical\nDisputations it receives both:\n\n\nAlthough a final cause is in a certain way more eminent than all\nothers and even prior [to them], its nature of causing is,\nnevertheless, more obscure and for that reason was almost entirely\nunknown to the ancient philosophers\u2026 For this reason \u2026\nin order to explain this more thoroughly and to resolve the\ndifficulties, it should first be inquired as to whether an end is a\ncause, then in what manner and what it causes, and also how many kinds\nof ends there are and what the nature of causing is for each one of\nthem (DM XXIII 1.1)\n\n\nHere, as elsewhere, Su\u00e1rez shows himself to be aware of many of\nthe sorts of problem that came to form the basis for the widespread\nrejection of teleological causation. Whether this redounds to his\ncredit, given his affirmation of their centrality to causation in\ngeneral, is an independent question.\n\nWe find him wondering expressly whether we are right to call the final\ncause a cause at all:\n\n\nBut that any whichever of these is a true cause can easily be proven\nindeed in the case of material, formal, and efficient [causes], for\nany whatever of these manifestly inflows some being\u2026 But\nconcerning the final cause there can be some reason for doubting,\nsince no real being is presupposed in it by which it could cause\n(De fine vero potest esse nonnulla dubitandi ratio, quia nullum\nesse reale in eo praesupponitur, quo causare possit: DM\nXIII 3.3)\n\n\nThe worry, according to Su\u00e1rez is that the final cause perhaps\nhas no \u201creal being\u201d (esse reale), in which case\nit could not enter into any kind of causal relation. In so speaking,\nhe is not just saying in a colorful way that perhaps the final cause\ndoes not exist, but rather that it is perhaps a mere fictum,\nthat possibly all of our appeals to final causation are merely\nconvenient fictions, able in principle to be replaced by appeals to\nother kinds of cause, those with real being, like efficient causes. If\nPonce de Le\u00f3n travelled to Florida in order to find the\nFountain of Youth, that is well and good; but the Fountain of Youth\ndoes not exist\u2014it has no esse reale\u2014and so\nit hardly caused him to do anything at all.\n\nIn more detail, Su\u00e1rez offers six distinct worries about final\ncausation (DM XXIII 1.1\u20136): (i) Every cause is a\nprincipium, but no end is a principium; hence, no\nend is a cause of any kind; (ii) every cause infuses being\n(influit esse) into its effect; no end does so; hence, no end\nis a cause: (iii) a form is an end; if an end were a real cause, form\nwould thus have to cause itself; nothing causes itself; hence the end\nis not a real cause; (iv) if an end is real cause, then it is also a\nmoving principle, and no end is a moving principle; hence, no end is a\ncause; (v) natural agents (here Su\u00e1rez is thinking of elements\nand beasts) have determinate propensities; the postulation of ends for\nbeings with determinate propensities is idle; hence, the postulation\nof final causes for natural agents lacks sufficient foundation; (vi)\none cannot specify what or in relation to what (quid vel circa\nquid) a final cause causes; if not, then a final cause does not\nimpart motion; hence, a final cause is not a cause.\n\nIn different ways, these objections call into question the status of\nthe final cause as cause. Some of them directly anticipate and address\nthe sorts of considerations which came to dominate later, often\ncaustic rejections of final causation.\n\nBe that as it may, Su\u00e1rez roundly affirms final causation. It\nis noteworthy, however, that he does so by offering significant\nconcessions to what came to be the textbook rejections of final\ncausation:\n\n\nAlthough the end is last in execution, nevertheless it is first in\nintention and under that aspect has the true nature of a principle.\nMoreover, the principle is not a fictum but is true and real\n(verum et reale), since it truly excites and moves. Hence,\njust as it has sufficient being by which it can exercise the sort of\nnature a principle has, so also it has the nature of a cause\n(DM XII 3.3).\n\n\nThe endorsement is clear. The concession comes in the phrases\n\u201cfirst in intention\u201d (primum in intentione) and\n\u201cunder that aspect\u201d (sub ea ratione), where\nSu\u00e1rez allows that a final cause qualifies as a cause only\nbecause and to the degree that it is conceived by an intentional\nagent. This, then, removes final causation from the realm of\nnon-intentional nature, even while affirming that final causes play an\nineliminable role in psychological explanation, particularly as\nregards intentional action.\n\nIn a positive vein, Su\u00e1rez argues on behalf of final causes by\nmeans of a simple counterfactual argument. One might say, for\ninstance, that someone made a journey to the store in order to buy\nmilk. The buying of milk, then, is the final cause of that\njourney. If it were discovered that store had unfortunately run out of\nmilk, then, suggests Su\u00e1rez, the milk, or the buying of the\nmilk, would remain the final cause of the action all the same;\notherwise there would have been no journey. To the rejoinder that the\nactual cause was not the milk, but the agent's desire to buy\nmilk, coupled with her belief that milk was to be had at the store,\nSu\u00e1rez readily agrees\u2014but then insists that the desire\nwould not be the desire it was were it not a desire for buying\nmilk. He contends, in other words, that the identity conditions\nof any desire to buy milk derive from the end, which is to say that\nfinal causation remains in play in the sphere of intentional action by\nproviding the very identity conditions of the desires which serve as\nefficient causes of intentional action. Still, this reasoning,\npositive though it is, also contains a large concession: final causes\nare implicated in the efficient causal realm only under the aspect of\nintentionality. This is why Su\u00e1rez ultimately concludes:\n\n\nI say first: in order for an end to cause, it is altogether necessary\nthat it be cognised in advance. (Dico ergo primo: ut finis causet,\nnecessarium omnino est ut praecognitus sit: DM XXIII\n7.2)\n\n2.5 Beings of Reason (entia rationis)\n\nSu\u00e1rez seems to have conceded a great deal to the critics of\nfinal causation in allowing that every final cause remains at root\nimplicated in the realm of the intentional. Still, again, he makes\nthis concession only by way of affirming the existence of final\ncauses. He has thereby also, however, evidently maneuvered himself\ninto an uncomfortable position whereby the Fountain of Youth, for\ninstance, is a final cause, even though it has no real being (esse\nreale). Yet he himself insists that nothing is a cause, or\nprincipium in general, without having real being. He thus\nowes an explanation of how he avoids falling into a direct\ncontradiction on this point. The Fountain of Youth cannot both lack\nreal being and be a cause, of any kind.\n\nHe offers his explanation in last chapter of his Metaphysical\nDisputations, which is dedicated to beings of reason (entia\nrationis). This disputation is independently interesting because\nit engages a question which has continued to fascinate metaphysicians\ndown to the present day, though it has taken various forms in various\nperiods of inquiry. This is the question of how we are to speak (or\nthink) about things that are not. If something is unavailable to be\nspoken or thought about, then, presumably, we do not speak or think\nabout it. After all, as Su\u00e1rez notes, non-existing\nbeings of reason about which we pretend to think or speak\n\n\nare neither true, real beings, because they are not capable of real\nand true existence, nor indeed do they have any true likeness with\nreal beings. (DM LIV 1.4)\n\n\nStill, according to Su\u00e1rez, we can and do think and speak about\nbeings of reason. It follows, then, that we do speak and think about\nthings which do not exist. It falls to the metaphysician to offer an\naccount of how this might be so. Indeed, for better or worse, the\nmetaphysician must address the topic of beings of reason, not least\nbecause, invariably and inevitably, such (non-)beings force themselves\ninto view along the periphery of any inquiry into real beings. To take\nbut one example, even if we think that there is no void, indeed even\nif we think that it is impossible that there should be a void, and so\nthink that the void is merely a being of reason, we will find\nourselves discussing \u201cthe void\u201d when investigating the\ncharacteristics of space, motion, matter, and quantity. We may ask,\nfor instance, whether the existence of motion requires the existence\nof the void, and, even if we decide that it does not, our inquiry into\nspace and motion\u2014certainly appropriate topics of inquiry for the\nmetaphysician\u2014has led us to consideration of a non-existing\nbeing, the void. So, in Su\u00e1rez's terms, inquiry into beings\ninevitably propels the metaphysician into consideration of\nnon-existing beings of reason. So, entia rationis\u2014these\nnon-beings\u2014require a treatment by the student of being.\n\nIt is first of all striking in Su\u00e1rez's treatment that the\nclass of entia rationis includes a seeming motley of cases,\nextending beyond non-existing objects of thought and reference (and so\nbeyond non-existent final causes). In addition to final causes which\nare not, the student of being finds himself confronted with\ntrue-sounding appeals to phantasmagorical and mythical beasts and\ncreatures of fiction of various sorts, even though their subjects have\nvacuous reference (\u201cPegasus is a winged horse\u201d). More\nimportantly, Su\u00e1rez countenances a whole range of other\nnon-beings among entia rationis, some of which are more\npedestrian than creatures of fiction: negations, such as being\nnot-human; privations, that is, lacks keyed to positive properties,\nsuch as blindness; and also (what he takes to be mere) logical\nabstractions, such as being a consequent or an antecedent; and\ntaxonomical categories, which, in view of his general nominalism, he\ntakes to be mere metaphysical abstractions, such as species and\ngenus.\n\nThe first thing to notice about this list is its heterogeneity.\nSu\u00e1rez is interested in a group of entities, broadly conceived,\nthat end up in metaphysical discourse even though they do not exist.\nNote, too, that he does not say that such entities do not exist\n\u201cstrictly speaking\u201d or \u201cfully\u201d or\n\u201creally\u201d or that they exist \u201cin the mind or\nimagination only\u201d. Instead he insists: they do not exist. Even\nso, in metaphysics and physics, we speak of genera and species; in\nlogic, of antecedents and consequences; in causation and metaphysics\nmore broadly, of privations; and in many walks of life, of\nnon-existent entities, often enough innocently imputing causal\nprofiles to them.\n\nFocusing on the last case, which is in any case the most colorful and\ncaptivating, Su\u00e1rez argues that it falls to the metaphysician\nto come to terms with such true sentences such as \u201cThe gryphon\nis fierce\u201d, \u201cGryphons do not exist\u201d, and even\n\u201cThe gryphon frightened the children to the point where some of\nthem began to cry uncontrollably\u201d. How can these sentences be\ntrue, when there is nothing here about which one may talk or think?\nWhat must be the case, if these sentences are to be accepted as true?\nPerhaps, one may think, the gryphon must exist in some way, if it is\nto be fierce; that if it can be said not to exist, then it\u2014the\nthing about which the speaker is speaking\u2014must exist in some one\nway but not in some other; and, most of all, that if it is to be\nimplicated in the causal network, it certainly must exist\u2014or\nelse it could not stand in a causal relation to anything at all.\nIndeed, Su\u00e1rez himself gives voice to just these sorts of\ncontention in other contexts. For example, this last observation is\nperfectly reflected in a claim he makes about the necessary conditions\nof formal causation: \u201cThe first requisite [for formal causation]\nis the actual existence of a form itself\u201d (prima est\nactualis existentia ipsius formae: DM XV 6.3). The\nquestion, then, is how beings of reason can enter the causal network\nif they fail this first requirement of any cause: that it exist.\n\nAt first it may seem as if Su\u00e1rez intends to hold that beings\nof reason do, in fact, have some mode of existence, perhaps some sort\nof subsistence or some mode of being short of the sort manifested by\nwhat he calls \u201ctrue, real beings\u201d. For instance, he\ncontends that \u201cbeings of reason must be granted\u201d\n(DM XLIV 1.4), and then hastens to add that:\n\n\nsuch beings are neither true, real beings, because they are not\ncapable of real and true existence, nor indeed do they have any true\nlikeness with real beings\u2014[any likeness, that is,] in terms of\nwhose account they would have a common concept of being with them.\n(DM XLIV 1.4).\n\n\nHe also insists that: \u201cfictitious things \u2026 or beings of\nreason, are not said to endure truly and properly, because they do not\nexist\u201d (DM L 1.1). So, again, it may seem as if he\nmeans to contend that they exist, though not in the manner of true and\nreal beings, or, again, insofar as they may be said to endure at all,\nthey do so not truly or but rather only improperly.\n\nThis is not at all, however, his view of entia rationis. His\napproach to them is in one way disarmingly simple: he insists that\nthey do not exist (Shields 2012b). Even so, he maintains, one may\nfreely speak of them as if they existed. Indeed, just as\n\u201cthey are fashioned or apprehended as if they truly existed,\nthey are further conceived as if they endured\u201d. His view, more\nfully:\n\n\nAgain, that objective being, even though the being of reason in itself\nis nothing, still necessarily supposes some real being, on which it is\nfounded, or from whose denomination or relation that objective being\nquasi-results (quasi resultet). Therefore, that cause which\nproduced such a real being is the cause of the being of reason\n(DM LIV 2.3).\n\n\nHis picture is that beings of reason are such that, although they do\nnot exist, one may speak and think as if they existed, where\nthe thinking in question is a real, existing formal structure in the\nmind of an actual thinker. Thinking is in this way contentful, because\nfounded in some real feature of some real thinker, but not therefore\nsuch as to take an object. One may think of Socrates or one may think\nof a gryphon; the gryphon's being thought, however, unlike Socrates's\nbeing thought, is not an extrinsic denomination of the gryphon, as it\nis of Socrates; for Socrates is and the gryphon is not. Were there a\ngryphon, says Su\u00e1rez, the formal structure of the thinker would\nindeed give rise to an extrinsic denomination of it, no more or less\nthat Socrates's being thought gives rise to such a feature of him.\nStill, he insists, because there is not such a gryphon, there is not\nsuch a feature to be had by him.\n\nIn short, then, the content of the thought derives from the real,\nformal structure in the mind of the thinker and not from the object.\nThat holds fixed across all episodes of thought. It is just that some\nthoughts are about something and others about nothing at all. Their\nbeing about nothing, insists Su\u00e1rez, hardly robs them of their\ncontentfulness: the motion of a missed punch is a real motion, and not\nthe same as the motion of a missed kick; but neither makes contact,\nand so in neither case is there something contacted, something kicked\nor punched. On the contrary, nothing is kicked in a missed kick, and\nnothing punched in a missed punch. In the same way, then, nothing is\nthought or referred to when there is no object of thought or\nreference. In such cases, all the causation involved eventuates from\nand reaches only the actual formal structures of an actual mind:\n\n\nall that efficient [causation] is terminated\u2014as to a terminus of\nreal production\u2014at the formal concept of the mind itself, and it\nstops there. (tota vero illa efficientia, ut ad terminum realis\nproductionis terminatur ad formalem conceptum ipsius mentis, et ibi\nsistit: DM LIV 2.3)\n\n\nTaking all that together, S can speak of the gryphon, though\nthere is no gryphon there to be spoken of; and the thinking in this\ncase is in all respects like the thinking that goes on in one who is\nthinking of Socrates. The difference is that Socrates comes to have an\nextrinsic denomination\u2014being thought of by\nS\u2014whereas the gryphon, who does not exist, does not acquire\nthis or any other denomination, extrinsic or intrinsic. There is,\nnonetheless, a fact about the world such that were there to be a\ngryphon, it would have acquired such a denomination, precisely because\nsome actual person would have been in the relevant state of thinking\nabout it.\n\nExactly the same holds true, according to Su\u00e1rez, of the other\nsorts of entia rationis he countenances: negations,\nprivations, and abstractions. They are not, but this does not preclude\nour thinking of them and speaking about them. Our doing so in no way\ninvests them with existence of any kind. This is how Su\u00e1rez\ninsists that entia rationis \u201cmust be granted\u201d\neven though they lack \u201cany true likeness with real beings\u201d\n(DM LIV 1.4).\n2.6 Metaphysical Theology\n\nNeedless to say, Su\u00e1rez regarded God as a being and not a being\nof reason. He also thought that unaided natural reason could go a long\nway towards providing a philosophically tenable description of the\nnature of God. Because of this, he devoted two book-length\ndisputations, Metaphysical Disputations XXIX and XXX\nto the topics of God\u2019s existence and nature, the second of\nwhich, devoted to God\u2019s nature, comprises 17 sections covering\nhis essence and attributes, insofar as these are accessible to human\nreasoning.\n\nIn his treatment of God\u2019s attributes, Su\u00e1rez concentrates\non perfection, \n infinitude,[14], \n simplicity, immutability, oneness,\ninvisibility incomprehensibility, and ineffability; he also\ninvestigates God\u2019s life, knowledge, will, omnipotence, and\n omnipresence.[15]\n The breadth, extension, and detail of\nSu\u00e1rez\u2019s discussion makes it impossible to consider all\nof these topics here. We may, however, consider a subset of these\nattributes as representative of his approach: perfection, infinitude,\nsimplicity, and immensity or omnipresence. Here we\ntreat only the foundational topic of God\u2019s perfection.\n\nSu\u00e1rez maintains, in common with many others of his period,\nthat God\u2019s attributes can be known by us as they truly are only\nby means of a manifest vision of him, something made possible only\nthrough his supernatural aid. Even so, natural reason can offer a\nlimited knowledge of God and can proceed, according to Su\u00e1rez,\nin two different ways. It can deduce divine attributes from the\nknowledge of the effects of divine operation (a posteriori).\nAlternatively, it can proceed by deducing one attribute from another\n(a priori) (DM XXX.1. intro). Su\u00e1rez applies\nboth of these demonstrative methods to each of the divine attributes\nin turn.\n\nCan it be demonstrated by natural reason that God is by his essence an\nabsolutely perfect being? This question is immediately complicated by\nthe fact that Su\u00e1rez recognizes two central senses of\n\u2018perfection\u2019 (DM XXX.1.1). In one sense, which he\ncalls \u2018privative\u2019, what is perfect is whole and lacks\nnothing required by its nature; in these sense we could\nspeak, for instance, of a perfect horse. In a second sense, which\nSu\u00e1rez calls \u2018negative or absolute\u2019, we refer to\nwhat is absolutely perfect\u2014perfect, that is, not relative to the\nstandard set by a thing\u2019s nature but in absolute terms. Such\nperfect entities necessarily have or contain every other perfection.\nSu\u00e1rez wishes to demonstrate that it belongs to the essence of\nGod to be perfect in both of these senses.\n\nSu\u00e1rez believes that imperfection in the sense of lacking\nsomething that is due to nature always comes from external causes. A\nhorse without tail is a horse which had its tail removed or was\nsomehow prevented from growing one. But there is nothing capable of\nmaking God less than perfect in this sense: nothing can damage him or\notherwise interfere with his perfection. God is not vulnerable to\nimperfection coming from without (DM XXX.1.2). This can be\nshown a priori, Su\u00e1rez contends, by reasoning from\nGod\u2019s other attributes. In the first instance, we can deduce\nGod\u2019s perfection from his simplicity; because he is simple, God\nis non-composite. Since partless entities cannot be partially\ndiminished, but either exist totally or are totally destroyed, it\nfollows that if God is simple, and exists, he must be perfect in the\nsense of being complete (DM XXX.1.2).\n\nLet us turn now to absolute perfection. Every perfection, says\nSu\u00e1rez, is either created or uncreated. If a perfect entity is\nuncreated, that entity must be God. If, however, something is created,\nit owes its existence to God. Created perfection is the effect of a\ncause able to bring about such an effect . According to a causal\nprinciple held in common by Su\u00e1rez and many of his peers, this\ncause must be more noble and more excellent than its effect (if only\nin the sense that it possesses perfection in itself and not as caused\nby something else). From this, Su\u00e1rez deduces that it belongs\nto the essence of God to posses in some way the perfections of all\ncreated beings in a mode that is more noble than the way in which\nthese perfections exist in created beings. This, then, constitutes his\na posteriori proof for God\u2019s absolute perfection\n(DM XXX 1.4).\n\nSu\u00e1rez thinks that God\u2019s absolute perfection can also be\ndemonstrated a priori. As the first cause of everything and\nthe most necessary being, it is necessary that God is also first in\nabsolute perfection. Su\u00e1rez adds that the very idea of\nperfection requires us to posit a completely perfect thing to serve as\nstandard for other beings admitting of degrees of perfection. This\nstandard, he infers, must be God (DM XXX.1.5).\n\nSu\u00e1rez notes, however, that his view that the most perfect\nbeing must be understood as containing the perfections of all\nother beings is not self-evident and requires being argued for as it\nis liable to be wrongly interpreted. Human beings are more perfect\nthan kangaroos, for example, but do not contain within themselves the\nperfections of kangaroos (for one thing, we cannot hop as high)\n(DM XXX 1.5).\n\nSu\u00e1rez maintains instead that God is not simply and in fact\nmore perfect than all other beings: he is more perfect in so far as he\nis the first principle or origin of all the perfections of\nall other beings. To be the first principle or origin of another is\nnot just to be more perfect than every other thing: a first principle\nmust additionally be more perfect in a determinate way than\nthe perfections of the beings for whose perfections he serves as an\norigin. This determinate way of being perfect Su\u00e1rez labels\n\u2018eminent\u2019.\n\nA second a priori proof offered by Su\u00e1rez (DM\nXXX.1.6) is that: (i) God is the most perfect not only of all existing\nbeings but also of all possible beings; (ii) therefore\u2014for\nreasons explained below\u2014God must be perfect in a higher sense than\nall other possible beings; (iii) this higher sense of perfection\nconsists in containing the perfections of all other possible\nbeings. The first premise (i) is shown thus: if there is a more\nperfect being than God, either it is a necessary being and exists in\nact, or it is not yet existent and would be produced by something else\nin order to exist. If this other, productive entity already exists,\nthen we do not have a\npossible being which more perfect than every actual\nbeing. On the other hand, this entity could not be merely possible,\nsince a less perfect being cannot create a more perfect being. The\nquestion thus arises: who or what would be able to create it? It\nfollows, then, that it is not possible to think of a possible being more\nperfect than God. That (ii) follows from (i) is shown thus: if the\nfirst being does not contain all the perfections of other beings, it\nis not the most perfect of all possible beings since in that instance\none could think of a possible being that is at least as perfect as the\nfirst being. It would then contain all the other perfections.\n\nSu\u00e1rez suggests a third a priori proof as well: the\nfirst being must be more perfect than any other being not in specific\nrespects but absolutely, which is to say in all respects.\nThus, for instance, human beings are more perfect than dogs in most\nrespects, but not as concerns their olfactory capacity. God must be\nmore perfect in every respect and for this reason he must include all\nthe perfections of lesser beings (DM XXX.1.7).\n\nOne might be tempted to infer on this basis that God must have the\nperfections of all lesser beings in the same mode as they exist in\nthose beings. Su\u00e1rez rejects this inference. Following other\ntheologians, he distinguishes between absolute and secundum\nquid perfections. Absolute perfections are those that can\ninhere without conflict or opposition in the same thing. These, then,\nbelong to the very idea (or \u201cformal concept\u201d) of God. By\ncontrast, the secundum quid perfections can be\nincompatible with one another and can be hypothetical in the sense\nthat they presuppose some imperfection in that in which they inhere\n(for example, sensory perception seems to involve the imperfection of\nbeing unable to know the qualities of things perceived in an\nunmediated way. So, we could not say that God \u201csees\u201d in\nthe sense we see). So, God has that perfection\n\u201ceminently\u201d, which means that his creative essence has the\ncapacity to communicate to or cause these perfections in beings (for\nexample to communicate the capacity of vision to us) (DM\nXXX.1.8).\n\nThe absolute (non-secundum quid) perfections are\npossessed by God formally (that is, not eminently). These perfections\nare also attributed to creatures, but not, then, in the same way. God\nis wise, but his wisdom has only some formal fittingness\n(covenientia) to ours. For Su\u00e1rez, our talk about\nGod\u2019s absolute perfections is analogical.\n3. Moral Theory and Natural Law\n\nSu\u00e1rez thus entered deeply into the metaphysical debates of his\nday. He was hardly, however, therefore indifferent to other, more\npractical areas of philosophy and society. Along with his fellow\nscholastic theologians, Su\u00e1rez was deeply interested in moral\nand social goodness and cared greatly about the sphere of human\naction. Also like his fellow scholastics, he tended to preface his\ntreatment of the moral goodness and badness of human actions with a\ndiscussion on the nature of the morality of action as such. The\nmorality of human actions, he held, is that by virtue of which a human\naction can contract the species of goodness or badness (De\nbonitate et malitia actuum humanorum, disp. 1, proem, in\nSu\u00e1rez, Opera omnia IV). To use an analogy: there is\nbad art and good art, but there are also properties which make an\nobject a work of art, that is, an object which can be specified as\ngood or bad qua work of art. For Su\u00e1rez, in\ndistinction to some present-day moral theorists, the nature of an act\ncannot be divorced from the mode of its production; neither, then, can\nits normative evaluation.\n\nSu\u00e1rez operated in a context where the two main competing views\nof the nature of morality were that: (1) the morality of the act\nconsists in its being in principle able to conform to the external\nstandards provided by reason; and (2) the morality of the act belongs\nto the act itself, quite apart from any external standards.\n\nSu\u00e1rez, against V\u00e1zquez (V\u00e1zquez 1608: I, 414, d.\n73 c. 9 n. 43), held the second view. For him, the morality of the act\nconsists in its dependence on volition as the productive impetus\nbehind the act and on reason as the guiding set of rules that the\nagent takes herself to be guided by in shaping the precise\ncharacteristics of the act (De bonitate, sect. 2, n. 15).\nSu\u00e1rez provides the parallel of the production of an artefact.\nAn artefact can be evaluated by the standards applying to artefacts\n(say, beauty or ugliness), because its producer took herself to be\nguided, in the act of production, by the rules of her art (De\nbonitate, sect. 2, n. 17). The mode of production defines the\nnature of the object. Thus, two objects that look identical may be\nsusceptible to different standards of judgment, because one might be\nan artefact (say, a carved stone) and the other not (say, a stone\nwhich fell from a cliff and broke, resulting in the same shape as the\ncarved stone).\n\nFor Su\u00e1rez, it was important to argue that the morality of\nhuman action belongs to the act itself. This he regarded as a\nnecessary precondition to arguing that the moral goodness or badness\nof actions can be ascertained regardless of the presence of commanding\nor prohibiting divine law. If acts are to have pre-positive moral\nproperties, they must also have a pre-positive aptitude to be morally\ngood or bad.\n\nOperating within this basic framework of morality, Su\u00e1rez\ndeveloped a theory of natural law that has attracted much attention\ndespite his consciously attempting to position himself midway between\ntwo radically opposed views about natural law. There was, on the one\nhand, extreme naturalism, which he attributed to Gregory of Rimini\n(DL II, 6.3). According to extreme naturalism, the moral law\ndoes not require an exercise of legislative will by God. The natural\ngoodness and badness of actions exhaustively generates all our moral\nobligations. Even if God had not have given us laws, or even, indeed,\nif God had not existed at all, on the version of extreme naturalism\nfavored by Gregory of Rimini, all the presently existing moral duties\nwould still apply.\n\nAt the other extreme was the voluntarism attributed by Su\u00e1rez\n(rightly or wrongly) to William of Ockham and to a lesser extent also\nto Duns Scotus (DL I, 6.4). According to this view, actions\nhave no intrinsic (pre-positive) goodness or badness (or, even if they\nhave some goodness and badness, this does not determine or constrain\nwhat we ought to do). Obligations come from divine commands resulting\nfrom the free exercise of God's will. Further, in this view, God is\nentirely free as to the content of the moral law. Should God command\nus to hate him, then this is what we ought to do.\n\nAs is characteristic of his general approach to his predecessors,\nSu\u00e1rez disagrees with both views without wholly disregarding\neither. He agrees that natural law, if it is genuine\n\u201claw\u201d, requires an act of imperium, a command by\nthe legislator expressing his will. Therefore, any obligation falling\nunder natural law derives its moral force from God's legislative act\n(DL I, 5.13). In Su\u00e1rez's terminology, natural law is\nnot \u201cindicative\u201d; it is not merely a way of telling us\nabout what is good and what is morally bad in itself. Rather it is\n\u201cpreceptive\u201d: it creates obligations that would otherwise\nnot exist.\n\nSo far, then, Su\u00e1rez's position agrees with voluntarism. He\nalso, however, believes that what is naturally good is necessarily\ncommanded by God and what is naturally bad is necessarily prohibited.\nTherefore, the content of natural law, unlike its binding\nforce, does not have a positive source. Rather, it is dictated by\ncreated nature itself, to which God's commands respond.\n\nInterpreters disagree on whether Su\u00e1rez leaves room for\npre-positive moral duties (that is, moral duties which do not draw\ntheir binding force from God's commands) and on whether, if this is in\nfact the case, such duties are compatible with his general account of\nnatural law. At the center of the debate is Su\u00e1rez's assertion\nthat the performance of an intrinsically bad action constitutes\nsinning and involves culpa (guilt/blame) regardless of a\nprohibition from above. According to John Finnis, this amounts to\npositing the existence of pre-positive obligations incompatible with\nSu\u00e1rez's view that all law involves the expression of the will\nof a superior (Finnis 1980: 46\u201349). Thomas Pink construes\nSu\u00e1rez's theory of natural law in a way that aims to avoid the\nincoherence produced by pre-positive obligations. On his construal,\nthe expression of a superior's will gives us additional\nreasons to perform an act that is already obligatory by reason of its\nintrinsic moral properties (Pink 2005: 42). \n\nStill, thus far Finnis's charge of incoherence remains a threat. After\nall, Su\u00e1rez does say that the force to oblige (vis\nobligandi) can only come from an act of will. A solution\nis provided by Terence Irwin. In his reading, what intrinsic moral\nproperties of actions generate are not obligations, but rather duties\n(debita) (Irwin 2012). Obligations, unlike duties, involve a\nsort of \u201cmoral motion\u201d. The idea is that obligations\nconstitute an act of imposing an obligation, an obliging.\nObliging is the tool the holder of legitimate power has in order to\nmove those under his command to do some actions and refrain from\nothers. As is clear from Su\u00e1rez's discussions on the influx of\ndivine grace, God's grace moves us morally (rather than physically) by\nmaking the performance of some good actions more attractive to reason\nthan they would otherwise be (De Gratia Dei seu de Deo\nSalvatore, III.41.3, in Su\u00e1rez, Opera omnia\nVIII). Intrinsic goodness does not involve an obliging because it is\nnot impelling us to do anything; unlike the presence of law or the\neffect of grace, intrinsic goodness is not a new influx that was not\nthere before. But this is not to say that intrinsic goodness does not\nexert a rational attraction on moral agents; it is simply that our\nnatural tendency to do what is good is not the result of any sort of\nmoving or pushing. In this reading, there is no contradiction between\nmaking room for the existence of pre-positive duties and insisting\nthat obligations only originate in law. The distinction between\nobligations and duties is not merely a verbal one, but points to the\ndifference between what in Aristotelian terms would be an efficient\nand final cause of motion.\n\nIt emerges, then, that Su\u00e1rez's theory of natural law is less\ncomprehensive than some have thought: it covers, qua lawful,\nonly those \u201coughts\u201d that result from the command of the\nsuperior.\n4. Political Authority\n\nWhat, if anything, makes political subjection legitimate? For\nSu\u00e1rez, the question is compelling given that \u201cman is by\nhis nature free and subject to no one, save only to the Creator\u201d\n(DL III, 1.1).\n\nAs Su\u00e1rez conceives of the basic position of humanity, the\ninhabitants of a hypothetical pre-political state would have two main\nreasons to try to transcend it. First, families, the basic unit of\nhuman organization, are not self-sufficient: they contain within\nthemselves neither the offices nor the arts necessary for survival.\nThey simply lack the requisite knowledge. Secondly, evoking the idea\nof a state of war, Su\u00e1rez argues that if families were divided\nfrom one another, peace could hardly be preserved among men, nor could\nwrongs be duly averted or avenged (Defensio fidei catholicae, et\napostolicae adversus anglicanae sectae errores, III.1.4, in\nSu\u00e1rez, Opera omnia XXIV). Inhabitants of the\npre-political state are thus capable of envisaging a possible\npolitical state, in which cooperation between families exists for some\ncommon purpose. They can thus realize that power must be vested in one\nor some individuals because \u201cnobody can be preserved unless\nthere exists some principle whose function is to provide for and seek\nits common good\u201d (DL III, 1.4\u20135).\n\nThe constitutive act of the community cannot simply be a decision by\neach family to live in proximity to each other and interact\npeacefully. This would create, at most, a certain familiarity or\nfriendship, but would fail to generate what Su\u00e1rez terms a\n\u201cmoral union\u201d. This moral union originates instead in the\nassumption of the duties and obligations that make political life\npossible. These, in turn, are incurred by an act of \u201cexpress or\ntacit pact\u201d between the would-be citizens to help each other,\ntogether with their consent to subordinate themselves to a superior\n(De opere sex dierum, V.7.3, in Su\u00e1rez, Opera\nomnia\n III).[16]\n\nThis view places Su\u00e1rez very close to the social contract\nschool. It is a central tenet of this school that the citizens\ncontract an obligation towards the political authority because they\nhave given express, tacit, or hypothetical consent to it. Some of\nSu\u00e1rez's interpreters have resisted this conclusion, arguing\nthat, for him, although consent creates the state, it does not\ndirectly cause political obligation. In this interpretation, just as\nthe right of a person to rule over his body \u201cnaturally\nresults\u201d (to use Su\u00e1rez's phrase) from his being a person\nand is independent from the means by which he was generated (so that,\nsay, an in vitro generated human being would also have these\nrights), so the right of the ruler(s) to rule over the city naturally\nflows from the fact that the city is a city, independently from the\nconsent that generated it.\n\nOther interpreters, such as Schwartz, argue that, for Su\u00e1rez,\nconsent directly causes political obligation without the mediation of\nthe political community (Schwartz 2008). What the political community\ncauses by \u201cnatural resultancy\u201d is not the citizens'\npolitical subjection to the ruler. Rather, it is the community's\noriginal rightful incumbency to the role of the ruler (its\nself-mastership). For Su\u00e1rez, to say that the self-mastership\nof the political community emanates by natural resultancy is simply a\nway of saying that this mastership has no external cause (such as\nGod). The right to self-rule of the political community has the same\norigin as the political community itself: consent. This effect is not\nmediated by any intervening cause.\n\nNote that for Su\u00e1rez the ruler's power is not the result of a\ntransfer or alienation of individual self-rule rights. Hence,\nSu\u00e1rez's ruler is not, as in Hobbes, the depositary of a part\nof the citizens' right over themselves. The seat of power remains\nalways, if only latently, with the community (Schwartz 2008: 71).\n5. Distributive Justice\n\nSu\u00e1rez's highly original discussion of distributive justice has\nbeen unjustly neglected. Its originality resides in the rejection of\nsome of the main principles of the Aristotelian conception of\ndistributive justice that significantly shaped the modern conception,\nincluding that of, for instance, John Rawls. Among these were the\nprinciples that distributive justice operates only when total funds\nare insufficient to meet some ideal or desired standard and that a\njust distribution is a just division and so presupposes a\ndivisible good and multiple recipients.\n\nHis fundamental break with Aristotelianism, however, resulted from his\nrejection of the view that distributive justice distinctly aims at\nproportional allocation. For Su\u00e1rez, the types of justice\nshould be distinguished by the type of right which they oversee rather\nthan by the ideal distributional pattern at which they should aim.\nDistributive justice oversees a right to the thing, rather\nthan a right in the thing (a ius ad rem rather than a ius\nin rem). The ius ad rem was usefully defined by Austin\nas \u201ca right of compelling you to pass me a right in\nrem\u201d (Austin, 1869: 993). Unlike infringements of iura\nin rem, those of iura ad rem do not call for\nrestitution. For example, if in a competition for public office, the\nbest candidate is not chosen, he has an actionable claim against the\nappointment committee, but he cannot say that he has been deprived of\nsomething that was his.\n\nFor Su\u00e1rez, in order to have a distributive justice claim it is\nnot enough to exhibit the quality that in principle entitles you to a\nshare. He provides this illustration: if someone works in your\nvineyard without your knowledge or consent, this does not mean that\nyou owe him wages. Distributive justice requires a background pact\nbetween the owner of the common stock (the community) and its members.\nThis pact defines the criteria that allow members to have actionable\nclaims to the receipt of a share of the common stock.\n\nAlthough this pact creates rights, the rights have pre-positive\nfoundations. In order to ground a debt to a reward an action must be\nof a value commensurate to the reward. Not all posited conditions\nindebt the promisor as a matter of justice, but only those that\ncorrespond to a pre-contractual fittingness or commensurability\nbetween the reward and the action or personal quality.\n\nDistributive justice, insofar as it is the sovereign's justice,\ngoverns also the enjoyment of property rights. The sovereign (in the\npolitical case, the community or its appointee) retains a form of\nsuperior ownership (which he terms \u201csupreme dominium\u201d)\nover private possessions (Disputatio de Iustitia 1.12, in\nSu\u00e1rez, Opera omnia XI). This means that the sovereign\ncan withdraw your property rights, say over your car, and transfer\nthem to someone else (say, to be used for security patrols). You could\nlodge a complaint that your private ownership of the car was more\nconducive to social utility (say, because you are a doctor). By\nlodging this complaint, however, you would not be claiming a violation\nof your property rights (as in the case of theft), but rather, of your\nright to property rights under agreed, public criteria\nregulating their allocation.\n6. Just War\n\nSu\u00e1rez extended his conception of justice to the arena of war,\nwriting one of the most exhaustive and lucid treatments of the justice\nof war available in the scholastic corpus. It covers justice ad\nbellum, in bello and, also, post bellum.\n\nThe discussion of ad bellum justice concerns the fundamentals\nof just war theory, including: the moral permissibility of war; the\ndifference between defensive and offensive war; legitimate authority\nto declare war; the requirement of a reasonable hope of victory; the\nconstraints imposed by charity in any resort to war; and the moral\nimplications of the domestic costs of wars which are in principle\njust. It also contains a compelling discussion of the duty of\nparticipants in war to investigate the presence of a just cause, as it\napplies to decision-makers, advisors, and various types of combatants,\nincluding mercenaries.\n\nHis discussion of ius in bello considers, among other things:\nthe category of \u201cinnocents\u201d and their immunities; the\n\u201cdoctrine of double effect\u201d as applied to war; the\nself-defence rights of collateral victims; the attendant possibility\nof a war that is just on both sides (if the collateral victims decide\nto defend themselves); and the peculiarities of civil war and the\npermissibility of deceiving the enemy. It also dwells on topics that\nare not typically discussed by today's just war theorists. These\ninclude the difference between participating in highly risky missions\nand using suicide as a weapon, the justice of concerted confrontations\n(both mutually agreed and forced by one of the parties), the\npermissibility of military alliances with infidels, the rights of\nsoldiers against the sovereign, and justice in the distribution of\nbooty.\n\nInterwoven in these discussions one can find topics that today would\nbe classed in the ius post-bellum category, in particular, on\nwhether victory, regardless of its justice, confers rights, and on the\nrights of just victors to the property found in enemy territory. Here,\nto appreciate the basic tenor of his approach, we may survey the\nad bellum just cause requirement.\n\nA just cause of war is \u201ca grave wrong which cannot be avenged or\nrepaired in any other way\u201d (DDB\n 4.1).[17]\n Examples are the unjust seizure of property of the prince or\nsubjects, violations to the rights of nations, and, controversially,\ngrave injuries to the honor or reputation of the prince or the\nsubjects (DDB 4.3).\n\nSu\u00e1rez places significant moral weight on the distinction, only\ntacitly present in Thomas Aquinas's treatment, between defensive and\noffensive or aggressive war. The defensive use of force aims to foil\nan attempt to inflict a wrong. The offensive use of force, by\ncontrast, aims at obtaining some form of satisfaction for wrongful\nharms that have been already perpetrated (DDB 1.6).\nSu\u00e1rez devotes some attention to cases in which applying this\nbinary distinction becomes complicated. Because aggressive or\noffensive war seems morally more problematic, it was natural for\nSu\u00e1rez to devote the most attention to it. Offensive war is an\nessentially a punitive response to the refusal to redress\npast wrongful harms. In the same way that domestic peace requires\nempowering the republic to punish domestic wrongs, so international\npeace requires that someone be vested with the power to punish\ninternational wrongs. Su\u00e1rez reasons that, given the absence of\na commonly acknowledged superior, this power must belong to each\nsovereign. Sovereigns thus assume the role of judges. A just offensive\nwar is therefore the meting out of just punishment (DDB\n4.5).\n\nJustice, however, is not likely to be served if the judge is also a\nparty to the dispute. Su\u00e1rez is well aware of this problem but\ntries to downplay it. He notes that rulers are less inclined than\nprivate persons to act on emotion and the thirst of vengeance.\nMoreover, they are regularly assisted by the more temperate opinion of\ntheir expert advisors. Recognizing that this may not be enough to\nsurmount the problem, Su\u00e1rez candidly says that once we accept\nthat someone must have the power to punish in the international arena,\nfor all their faults, there are simply no better candidates for this\nrole than sovereigns (DDB 4.7). Furthermore, the unjust party\nhas only itself to blame for the judge's partiality since, by refusing\nto give satisfaction, it exposed itself to sentencing by a biased\njudge. The argument comes across as flawed, since whether or not\nsatisfaction was due is precisely part of what is at stake.\n\nThe presence of a just cause of war is not always sufficient to make\nwar morally permissible. Some wars may be just but nevertheless\nviolate other moral injunctions. This may happen, for instance, when a\nwealthy and prosperous country demands satisfaction for a wrong done\nby a poor country, knowing it is impossible for it to do so without\nfalling into utmost deprivation. In these circumstances, resorting to\nwar may be just but nevertheless uncharitable. However, violations of\nthe duties of charity do not impose a posterior duty to restitute, so\nlong as justice has not been infringed (DDB 4.8).\n\nThere is another sense in which the presence of a just cause is not\nsufficient to make war morally permissible. While making decisions\nabout war, the ruler must consider not only whether his cause is just,\nbut also whether its prosecution by the sword is beneficial to the\nrealm's subjects. A war may pursue a just cause and yet involve\ninjustice towards the subjects of the warring country if it manifestly\nharms the subjects' common good. In such cases, the ruler acts as\ntyrant; the subjects are merely treated as means to avenge wrongs done\nto him, while they themselves suffer serious loss (DDB\n4.8).\n\nFor war to be morally permissible, is it necessary that, in addition\nto having a just cause, it is also certain that the just cause will be\nachieved? The Renaissance Thomist commentator, Cardinal Thomas de Vio,\nknown as Cajetan, thought\n so.[18]\n Su\u00e1rez considered such absolute certainty to be unachievable,\nand requiring it to be undesirable: waiting to attain this degree of\ncertainty could result in a dangerous postponement of the business of\njustice. In addition, he thought that this requirement discriminated\nagainst weaker countries by making it more difficult for them to\npursue justice as compared to stronger countries (DDB\n4.10).\n",
