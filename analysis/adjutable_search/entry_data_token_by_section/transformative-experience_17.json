    "main_text": "Applied Ethics: In Light of Transformation, How Should We Treat Others? || Choosing for Others\n6.1 Choosing for Others\n\nPlausibly, it\u2019s wrong to interfere with the autonomy of others,\nespecially when it comes to important personal decisions. As Akhlaghi\n(2022, 7) points out, interference is even less defensible when\nothers are choosing to undergo transformative experiences because\nthere is a\n\n\nmoral duty not to interfere with the autonomous self-making of others,\nthrough their choosing to undergo transformative experience to\ndiscover who they will become.\n\n\nHowever, people often find themselves in situations in which they need\nto make decisions on behalf of others that may lead to transformative\nexperiences. In fact, those who take the leap and become parents then\nfind themselves in a position to make transformative decisions on\nbehalf of their children. For instance, some parents of deaf children\nmust decide whether to get cochlear implants for their child. Ideally,\nchildren receive these implants when they are extremely young, usually\nbefore the age of three. The early age at which the decision must be\nmade forces parents to choose on behalf of their children. In addition\nto being a choice that affects how their children will perceive and\nnavigate the world, the choice carries incredibly significant social\nconsequences. Deaf communities offer distinctive goods that hearing\ncommunities cannot, and vice versa. Furthermore, as disability\nadvocates point out, the difference between being deaf and non-deaf is\n\u201cmere-difference\u201d rather than \u201cbad-difference\u201d\n(see, e.g., Barnes 2014). This offers a further reason to believe that\nthe decision to give a child a cochlear implant is a transformative\none that must be made on the basis of the child\u2019s future\nexperiences as deaf or hearing as opposed to on the basis of\nvalue.\n\nPut this way, parental choices, especially significant ones like\ndeciding whether to get a child a cochlear implant, also resemble the\nnon-identity problem. Parfit (1984) raises the non-identity problem as\na puzzle for decisions that affect who will exist in the\nfuture. For instance, suppose a potential parent is choosing between\nimplanting one of two embryos, and chooses one that has a genetic\ndefect that causes monthly migraines that the other embryo lacks.\nGiven that there are no other relevant differences between the two\nembryos, it appears that the parent has done something wrong by\nbringing into existence a person who will have a lower level of\nwelfare than the other person who could have existed instead. However,\nit\u2019s not obvious who the potential parent has harmed.\nAssuming the migraine-inflicted person prefers existing to never\nhaving existed, they have not been harmed since the alternative is\nnon-existence. If that\u2019s right, then perhaps the parents have\ndone nothing wrong since no one has been harmed.\n\nSimilarly, the personally transformative aspect of transformative\nexperiences affects who exists after undergoing the experience.\nReceiving a cochlear implant and growing up in a hearing community\nwill transform the child into a radically different person from who\nthe child would be if they did not receive an implant and grew up in a\ndeaf community. The person who develops won\u2019t have grounds to\ncomplain since wishing their parents had chosen otherwise would be\nlike wishing they did not exist. But even if one does not believe that\nthe cochlear implant is an existence-affecting decision point, the\nfact that the two potential futures are so foreign to each other means\nthat a person situated in one of those futures cannot project what it\nwould be like to have had the other life. If the earlier points about\nprojecting value are correct, the person who has grown up in the deaf\ncommunity cannot assign a subjective value to the alternate life in\nwhich they had the cochlear implant, and vice versa. Without those\nvalue assignments, it doesn\u2019t appear that either person can\nclaim that they would have been better off in the alternate scenario.\nThus, whether the person receives the cochlear implant or not,\narticulating how that transformation harmed them will be challenging.\nPerhaps the parent can choose either option without harming or\nwronging anyone. The situation is also similar from the perspective of\nthe parents and their preferences, for they will have grown to love\ntheir child and the particular person into whom they have\ndeveloped.\n\nPhilosophers diverge on how parents should choose in these cases.\n(See, e.g., Harman (2015) for an interesting discussion on when\n\u201cI\u2019ll be glad I did it\u201d reasoning is appropriate.)\nHowever, there\u2019s a more interesting lesson to be drawn from\nthese types of cases. Recall from\n \u00a74.1\n and\n \u00a74.2\n that Paul objects to certain types of decision-making strategies\nbecause they treat future selves as if they were third persons rather\nthan integrated parts of the same self. These cases show that even in\nthe third person case, standard decision-making procedures are not\nparticularly helpful. Transformative experiences still create major\nchallenges for decision-making.\n\nAt the other end of life, decisions must sometimes be made for people\npost-transformation. People suffering from dementia or\nAlzheimer\u2019s transform in myriad ways, and their preferences\noften diverge from the preferences of their earlier selves. Sometimes,\nthese preferences regard end of life care. Since the person with\ndementia or Alzheimer\u2019s is not considered legally competent to\nchange their advanced directives, others must make important medical\ndecisions on their behalf. These people must decide whether to respect\nthe preferences of the past self, or the current one. In some ways,\nthis a questions about the weight that ought to be assigned to past\npreferences, and we might resolve in the way Pettigrew (2019) suggests\nby constructing a general value function that aggregates the past and\ncurrent preferences. However, if the personal transformation is taken\nseriously, the current self is a different person. Binding them to the\npreferences of the past self is akin to binding them to the\npreferences of another person.\n",
