    "main_text": "Five Widely Accepted Assumptions (And a Sixth, More Controversial One) || Inclusivity\n5.1 Inclusivity\n\nThe inclusiveness constraint derives entirely from the needs of\npractice. No matter what theory of decisional capacity we develop, it\nmust turn out that most ordinary adults count as having capacity most\nof the time (Buchanan & Brock 1989: 21; Appelbaum 1998). In other\nwords, as a society we are morally committed to imposing minimal\nrestraints on individual choice. Most people are free to make most\nchoices in their lives for themselves, even including self-harming\nchoices. It would therefore be intolerable if our account of\ndecisional capacity in medicine were to differ significantly from that\nnorm, especially given that the doctrine of informed consent arose in\nthe context of a movement aiming to give greater decisional power to\npatients and research subjects. Thus, it is generally recognized that\nfailure of a theory to be inclusive enough would be sufficient by\nitself for rejecting an account of decisional capacity.\n",
