    "main_text": "Plato\n3. Plato\n\nIf the objections to intellectualism are warranted, Plato makes\nsignificant progress by having his character Socrates suppose that the\nsoul has desires that are not always for what is good. This allows for\nthe complexities of moral psychology to become an important issue in\nthe account of virtue. That development is found in Plato\u2019s\nmature moral theory. In the Republic, especially in its first\nfour books, Socrates presents the most thorough and detailed account\nof moral psychology and virtue in the dialogues.\n\nIt all begins with the challenge to the very notion of morality,\nunderstood along traditional lines, mounted by Callicles in the second\nhalf of the Gorgias and by Thrasymachus in Republic\nI. Callicles thinks that moral convention is designed by the numerous\nweak people to intimidate the few strong ones, to keep the latter from\ntaking what they could if they would only use their strength. No truly\nstrong person should be taken in by such conventions (Gorg.\n482e ff). Thrasymachus argues that justice is the advantage of the\nmore powerful; he holds that justice is a social practice set up by\nthe powerful, i.e., rulers who require their subjects through that\npractice to act against their own individual and group self-interest\n(Rep. 338d ff). No sensible person should, and no\nstrong-willed person would, accept rules of justice as having any\nlegitimate authority over them. In answer to the latter challenge, in\nRepublic II, Glaucon and Adeimantus repeatedly urge Socrates\nto show what value justice has in itself, apart from its rewards and\nreputation. They gloss the intrinsic value of justice as what value it\nhas in the soul (358b\u2013c), what it does to the soul simply and\nimmediately by its presence therein. Before giving what will be a new\naccount of the soul, Socrates introduces his famous comparison between\nthe soul and the city. As he develops his account of the city,\nhowever, it becomes clear that Socrates is talking about an ideal\ncity, which he proceeds to construct in his discussion.\n\nThis city has three classes (gen\u00ea) of citizens. The\nrulers are characterized by their knowledge about and devotion to the\nwelfare of the city. The auxiliaries are the warrior class that helps\nthe rulers. These two are collectively the guardians of the city\n(413c\u2013414b; 428c\u2013d). Finally, there are the farmers,\nartisans, and merchants \u2013 in general those concerned with the\nproduction of material goods necessary for daily life\n(369b\u2013371e). The importance of this structure is that it allows\nSocrates to define virtues of the city by relations among its parts.\nThese virtues are justice, wisdom, courage, and moderation. For\ninstance, justice in the city is each one performing that function for\nwhich he is suited by nature and not doing the work that belongs to\nothers (433a\u2013b). One\u2019s function, in turn, is determined by\nthe class to which he belongs. So rulers should rule and not amass\nwealth, which is the function of the farmers, artisans, and merchants;\nif the rulers turn from ruling to money-making they are unjust.\n\nCompleting the analogy, Socrates gives an account of the soul. He\nargues that it has three parts, each corresponding to one of the\nclasses in the city. At this point, we should note the difficulty of\ntalking about parts of the soul. In making his argument about conflict\nin the soul, Socrates does not usually use a word that easily\ncorresponds to the English \u2018part.\u2019 Sometimes he uses\n\u2018form\u2019 (eidos) and \u2018kind\u2019\n(genos) (435b\u2013c), other times a periphrasis such as\n\u2018that in the soul that calculates\u2019 (439d\u2013e),\nalthough in the subsequent account of virtue, we do find\nmeros, which means part (442b\u2013d). So, insofar as\nvocabulary is concerned, one should be cautious about taking the\nsubdivisions of the soul to be independent agents. Perhaps the least\nmisleading way of thinking about the parts is as distinct functions.\nReason is the function of calculating, especially about what is good\nfor the soul. The appetites for food, drink, and sex are like the\nproducing class \u2013 they are necessary for bodily existence\n(439c\u2013e). These two parts are familiar to the modern reader, who\nwill recognize the psychological capacity for reasoning and\ncalculating, on the one hand, and the bodily desires, on the other.\nLess familiar is the part of the soul that corresponds to the\nauxiliaries, the military class. This is the spirited part\n(thymos or thymoeides). Associated with the heart,\nit is an aggressive drive concerned with honor. Thumos is\nmanifested as anger with those who attack one\u2019s honor. Perhaps\nmore importantly, it is manifested as anger with oneself when failing\nto do what one knows he should do (439e\u2013440d).\n\nThe importance of this account is that it is a moral psychology, an\naccount of the soul which serves as a basis for explaining the\nvirtues. Socrates\u2019 account also introduces the idea that there\nis conflict in the soul. For instance, the appetites can lead one\ntoward pleasure which reason recognizes is not good for the whole\nsoul. In cases of conflict, Socrates says the spirited part sides with\nreason against appetite. Here we see in rough outline the chief\ncharacters in a well-known moral drama. Reason knows what is good both\nfor oneself and in the treatment of others. The appetites,\nshort-sighted and self-centered, pull in the opposite direction. The\nspirited part is the principle that sides with reason and enforces its\ndecrees.\n\nWhile the opposition between reason and appetite establishes their\ndistinctness, it has another, more profound consequence. Most\ncommentators read this section of the argument as implying that reason\nlooks out for what is good for the soul while appetite seeks food,\ndrink, and sex, heedless of their benefit for the soul (437d ff).\nAlthough open to various interpretations, the difference between\nreason and appetite does seem aimed at one of the central paradoxes of\nSocratic intellectualism. Common experience seems to contradict the\nclaim that if one knows what is good he will do it; there seem to be\nobvious instances where someone does what she, in some sense, knows is\nnot good, while having options to act otherwise. By introducing\nnon-rational elements in the soul, the argument in the\nRepublic also introduces the possibility of doing what one\nknows, all things considered, not to be good. In such cases, one is\nmotivated by appetite, which lacks the capacity to conceive of what is\ngood, all things considered.\n\nSome interpret this heedlessness as appetite\u2019s being\ngood-independent, whereas reason is good-dependent. Thus, appetite\npursues what it pursues without reference to whether what it pursues\nis good; reason pursues what it pursues always understanding that what\nit pursues is good. In this kind of interpretation, Socrates in the\nRepublic accepts the possibility of akrasia because\nsome parts of the soul, which are indifferent to the good, can\nmotivate actions that do not aim at what is good. Others interpret\nthis heedlessness as appetite\u2019s operating on a constrained\nnotion of good; for instance, for appetite only pleasure is good. By\ncontrast, reason operates on a larger notion, i.e., what is good, all\nthings considered. In this interpretation, akrasia is also\npossible, but now because some parts of the soul, which motivate\naction, do so with a constrained view of good. In any event, the stage\nis set for conflict in the soul between reason and appetite. If we\nassume that either can motive action on its own, the possibility\nexists for the soul\u2019s pursuing bodily pleasure in spite of\nreason\u2019s determination that doing so is not good, all things\nconsidered. This potential gives rise to a separate strain of thinking\nabout virtue. While, for Socratic intellectualism, virtue just is\nknowledge, in the aftermath of the argument for subdividing the soul,\nvirtue comes to have two aspects. The first is to acquire the\nknowledge which is the basis of virtue; the second is to instill in\nthe appetites and emotions \u2013 which cannot grasp the knowledge\n\u2013 a docility so that they react in a compliant way to what\nreason knows to be the best thing to do. Thus, non-rational parts of\nthe soul acquire reliable habits on which the moral virtues\ndepend.\n\nGiven the complexity of the differences among the parts, we can now\nunderstand how their relations to one another define virtue in the\nsoul. Virtue reduces the potential for conflict to harmony. The master\nvirtue, justice, is each part doing its function and not interfering\nwith that of another (441d\u2013e; 443d). Since the function of\nreason is to exercise forethought for the whole soul, it should rule.\nThe appetites, which seek only their immediate satisfaction, should\nnot rule. A soul ruled by appetites is the very picture of\npsychological injustice. Still, to fulfill its function of ruling,\nreason needs wisdom, the knowledge of what is beneficial for each of\nthe parts of the soul and for the whole. Moderation is a harmony among\nthe parts based on agreement that reason should rule. Courage is the\nspirited part carrying out the decrees of reason about what is to be\nfeared (442b\u2013d). Any attentive reader of the dialogues must feel\nthat Socrates has now given an answer to the questions that started\nmany of the aporetic dialogues. At this point, we have the fully\ndeveloped moral psychology that allows the definition of the moral\nvirtues. They fall into place around the tripartite structure of the\nsoul.\n\nOne might object, however, that all Socrates has accomplished is to\ndefine justice and the other virtues as they operate within\nthe soul. While each part treats the others justly, so to speak, it is\nnot clear what justice among the parts of someone\u2019s soul has to\ndo with that person treating other people justly. Socrates at first\naddresses this issue rather brusquely, saying that someone with a just\nsoul would not embezzle funds, rob temples, steal, betray friends,\nbreak oaths, commit adultery, neglect parents, nor ignore the gods.\nThe reason for this is that each part in the soul does its own\nfunction in the matter of ruling and being ruled (443a\u2013b).\nSocrates does not explain this connection between psychic harmony and\nmoral virtue. However, if we assume that injustice is based in\noverweening appetite or unbridled anger, then one can see the\nconnection between restrained appetites, well-governed anger and\ntreating others justly. The man whose sexual appetite is not governed\nby reason, e.g., would commit the injustice of adultery.\n\nThis approach to the virtues by way of moral psychology, in fact,\nproves to be remarkably durable in ancient moral theory. In one way or\nanother, the various schools attempt to explain the virtues in terms\nof the soul, although there are, of course, variations in the\naccounts. Indeed, we can treat the theory of the Republic as\none such variation. While the account in Republic IV has\naffinities with that of Aristotle in Nicomachean\nEthics, for instance, further developments in\nRepublic V\u2013VII make Plato\u2019s overall account\naltogether unique. It is in these books that the theory of forms makes\nits appearance.\n\nIn Republic V, Socrates returns to the issue of political\nrule by asking what change in actual cities would bring the ideal city\ncloser to realization. The famous answer is that philosophers should\nrule as kings (473d). Trying to make the scandalous, even ridiculous,\nanswer more palatable, Socrates immediately begins to explain what he\nmeans by philosophers. They are the ones who can distinguish between\nthe many beautiful things and the one beautiful itself. The beautiful\nitself, the good itself, and the just itself are what he calls forms.\nThe ability to understand such forms defines the philosopher\n(476a\u2013c). Fully elaborated, this extraordinary theory holds that\nthere is a set of unchanging and unambiguous entities, collectively\nreferred to as being. These are known directly by reason in a way that\nis separate from the use of sensory perception. The objects of sensory\nperception are collectively referred to as becoming since they are\nchanging and ambiguous (508d). This infallible grasp means that one\nknows what goodness is, what beauty is, and what justice is. Because\nonly philosophers have this knowledge \u2013 an infallible grasp of\ngoodness, beauty, and justice \u2013 they and only they are fit to be\nrulers in the city.\n\nWhile moral theory occupies a significant portion of the\nRepublic, Socrates does not say a lot about its relation to\nthe epistemology and metaphysics of the central books. For instance,\none might have expected the account to show how, e.g., reason might\nuse knowledge of the forms to govern the other parts of the soul.\nIndeed, in Book VI, Socrates does say that the philosopher will\nimitate in his own soul the order and harmony of the forms out of\nadmiration (500c\u2013d). Since imitation is the heart of the account\nof moral education in Books II\u2013III, the idea that one might\nimitate forms is intriguing; but it is not developed. In fact, the\nrelation between virtues in the soul and the metaphysics and\nepistemology of the forms is not an easy one. For instance, Socrates\nsays that virtue in the soul is happiness (580b\u2013c). However, he\nalso says that knowledge and contemplation of the forms is happiness\n(517c\u2013d). Since having or exercising the virtues of wisdom,\nmoderation, courage, and justice is different from knowledge and\ncontemplation of forms, the questions naturally arises about how to\nbring the two together into an integrated life. In the dialogues, the\nrelation between knowledge of forms and virtues such as moderation,\njustice, and courage is an issue that never seems to be fully resolved\nbecause it receives different treatments.\n\nIn RepublicIX, Socrates offers a sketch of one way to bring\nthese two dimensions together. Toward the end of the book, Socrates\nconducts a three-part contest to show the philosophical, or\naristocratic, man is the happiest. In the second of these contests, he\nclaims that each part of the soul has its peculiar desire and\ncorresponding pleasure. Reason, for instance, desires to learn;\nsatisfying that desire is a pleasure distinct from the pleasure, e.g.,\nof eating (580d\u2013e). One can now see that the functions of each\nof the parts has a new, affective dimension. Then, in the last of the\ncontests, Socrates makes an ontological distinction between true\npleasure of the soul and less true pleasure of the body. The former is\nthe pleasure of knowing being, i.e., the forms, and the latter is the\npleasure of filling bodily appetite. The less true pleasures also give\nrise to illusions and phantoms of pleasure; these illusions and\nphantoms recall the images and shadows in the allegory of the cave\n(583b\u2013586c). Clearly, then, distinctions from the metaphysics\nand epistemology of the central books are being made relevant to the\ndivisions within the soul. Pleasures of reason are on a higher\nontological level than those of the bodily appetites; this difference\ncalls for a modification of the definitions of the virtues from Book\nIV. For instance, in Book IV, justice is each part fulfilling its own\nfunction; in Book IX, that function is specified in terms of the kinds\nof pleasure each part pursues. Reason pursues the true pleasure of\nknowing and the appetites the less true pleasure of the body. Appetite\ncommits injustice if it pursues pleasure not proper to it, i.e., if it\npursues bodily pleasures as though they were true pleasures\n(586d\u2013587a). The result is an account of virtue which\ndiscriminates among pleasures, as any virtue ethics should; but the\ncriterion of discrimination reflects the distinction between being and\nbecoming. Rational pleasures are more real than bodily pleasures,\nalthough bodily pleasures are not negligible. Happiness, in turn,\nintegrates the virtue of managing bodily appetites and pleasures with\nthe pleasures of learning, but definitely gives greater weight to the\nlatter.\n\nHowever, in the Phaedo, we find another approach to the\nrelation between knowledge of forms and virtues in the soul. Socrates\nidentifies wisdom with kowledge of such forms as beauty, justice, and\ngoodness (65d\u2013e). The philosopher can know these only by reason\nthat is detached from the body as much as possible (65e\u201366a). In\nfact, pure knowledge is found only when the soul is completely\ndetached from the body in death. With such a severe account of the\nknowledge of the forms it is not surprising that courage, justice, and\nmoderation are subordinated to wisdom. When Socrates says the true\nexchange of pleasures, pains, and fears is for wisdom, he invokes\nmoderation, justice, and courage as virtues that serve this exchange\n(68b\u201369e). This passage suggests, for instance, that moderation\nwould control bodily pleasures and pains and fears so that reason\ncould be free of these disturbances in order to pursue knowledge. This\nnotion of virtues differs from the account in the first books of the\nRepublic in that the latter presents a comprehensive picture\nof the welfare of all the parts of the soul whereas the\nPhaedo, by implication, subordinates to reason those parts\ncharacterized by pleasures, pain, and fears.\n\nIn the Symposium, we find yet another configuration of the\nrelation between virtue and the forms, in which the non-rational parts\nof the soul disappear \u2013 or are sublimated. In Diotima\u2019s\ndiscourse on eros, she argues that the real purpose of love\nis to give birth in beauty (206b\u2013c). This idea implies two\ndimensions: inspiration by what is itself beautiful and producing\nbeautiful objects. Although Diotima talks about the way these concepts\nwork in sexual procreation, her real interest is in their\npsychological manifestations. For instance, the lover, inspired by the\nphysical beauty of the beloved, will produce beautiful ideas. In turn,\nthe beauty of a soul will inspire ideas that will improve young men\n(210a\u2013d). Finally, Diotima claims that the true object of erotic\nlove is not the beautiful body or even the beautiful soul \u2013 but\nbeauty itself. Unlike the beauty of bodies and of souls, this beauty\ndoes not come to be nor pass away, neither increases nor decreases.\nNor does it vary according to aspect or context. It is not in a face\nor hands but is itself by itself, one in form (211a\u2013c). Since\nthis paradigm of beauty is the true object of eros, it\ninspires its own particular product, i.e., true virtue, distinct from\nthe images of virtue inspired by encounters with beauty in bodies and\nsouls (212a\u2013c). While this passage highlights the relation\nbetween eros and the form of beauty in motivating virtue, it\nis almost silent on what this virtue might be. We do not know whether\nit just is the expression of love of beauty in the lover\u2019s\nactions, or its concretization in the dispositions of the\nlover\u2019s soul, or another manifestation. Clearly, this account in\nthe Symposium works without the elaborate theory about parts\nof the soul and their function in virtue, found in Republic\nI\u2013IV.\n\nAs with other ancient theories, this account of virtue can be called\neudaimonist. Plato\u2019s theory is best represented as holding that\nvirtue, together with its active exercise, is the most important and\nthe dominant constituent of happiness (580b\u2013c). One might object\nthat eudaimonist theories reduce morality to self-interest. We should\nrecall however that eudaimonia in this theory does not refer\nprimarily to a feeling. In the Republic, it refers to a state\nof the soul, and the active life to which it leads, whose value is\nmultifaceted. The order and harmony of the soul is, of course, good\nfor the soul because it provides what is good for each of the parts\nand the whole, and so makes the parts function well, for the benefit\nof each and of the whole person. In this way, the soul has the best\ninternal economy, so to speak. Still, we should not overlook the ways\nin which order and harmony in the soul are paired with order and\nharmony in the city. They are both modeled on the forms. As a\nconsequence, virtue in the soul is not a private concern artificially\njoined to the public function of ruling. Rather, the philosopher who\nimitates forms in ruling her soul is equally motivated to imitate\nforms in ruling the city. So, insofar as virtue consists in imitating\nthe forms, it is also a state of the soul best expressed by exercising\nrule in the city \u2013 or at least in the ideal city.\nEudaimonia, then, includes looking after the welfare of\nothers.\n\nIndeed, the very nature of Plato\u2019s account of virtue and\nhappiness leaves some aspects of the link between the two unclear.\nWhile virtue is the dominant factor in happiness, we still cannot tell\nwhether for Plato one can have a reason for being, e.g., courageous\nthat does not depend directly on happiness. Plato, even though he has\nforged a strong link between virtue and happiness, has not addressed\nsuch\u00a0issues. In his account, it is still possible that one might\nbe courageous just for its own sake while at the same time believing\ncourage is also reliably linked to happiness. In the\nRepublic, Socrates tries to answer the question what value\njustice has by itself in the soul; it does not follow that he is\ntrying to convince Glaucon and Adeimantus that the value of justice is\nexhausted by its connection to one\u2019s own happiness.\n\n(For further developments in Plato\u2019s moral theory in dialogues\nusually thought to postdate the Republic (especially\nPhilebus), see\n Plato\n entry, especially the section on\n Socrates\n and the section on\n Plato\u2019s indirectness.)\n",
