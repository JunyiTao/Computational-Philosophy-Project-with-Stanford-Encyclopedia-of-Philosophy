    "main_text": "The Physical Principles || The Principle of Predominance\n3.4 The Principle of Predominance\n\n\nFragment B12 ends with a further discussion of mixture and separation,\nand Anaxagoras\u2019 enunciation of what has come to be called the\n\u201cPrinciple of Predominance.\u201d After reasserting that no\ningredient is ever fully dissociated or separated from any other\n(except for nous, which is not an ingredient),\nAnaxagoras adds that all nous is alike (that is, cosmic\nnous and mind in us share the same nature), but\n\u201cNothing else is like anything else, but each one is and was\nmost manifestly those things of which there are the most in it.\u201d\nThus, something is hot, if hot predominates over the cold in it, flesh\nif flesh predominates over other ingredients, and so on. The principle\ndoes not claim that there is any single predominating ingredient at\neach place in the mixture. Rather, the predominance seems to be along\nnumerous lines of possibility: more flesh than blood, more hot than\ncold, more red than green, and so on (Furley 2002).  This need not\nmean that there is more humanity than doghood in a human being (indeed\nit could not mean this, on the account advanced in this article, which\nrules out dogs and humans as Anaxagorean ingredients). Rather, to be a\nhuman being is to have a certain set of predominant characteristics\narranged in a certain way (that arrangement may be the work of soul\n\u2014 perhaps nous \u2014 in a living thing).\n\n\nA problem for the Principle of Predominance is to determine what it is\nto be a predominant ingredient, especially given the\nEverything-in-Everything and No Smallest principles. A classic example\nis the following: the gold in this gold ring is that discontinuous\npart of the total mixture in which gold predominates. But now, as\nStrang says, \u201cConsider the gold which predominates as an\ningredient: does it also, like the original piece of gold, contain\nwithin it an admixture of all other substances? If so, it is gold\nbecause gold predominates in it as an ingredient; and we can ask the\nsame question about the ingredient of the ingredient, and so on ad\ninfinitum\u201d (Strang 1963, 101; see also Cornford\n1930). Because there can be no pure gold (there is no pure anything),\nit becomes difficult to see what the gold could be that predominates\nin anything. But if I cannot determine what predominates in it, I\ncannot determine what anything is.\n\n\nStrang 1963 proposes a solution to the problem. While acknowledging\nthat there can never be pure instances of any ingredient in actuality,\nthere could be such instances in analysis. I can analyze mixtures and\ndetermine predominant ingredients, but I will never be able to produce\na pure instance of such an ingredient.  The problem here is how this\nwould be worked out, and why I can be certain that there are such\nnatures (as we might call them).  Anaxagoras suggests two\nthings. First, in B12 he stresses that nous has the\npower to know and understand all the ingredients (indeed cosmic\nnous apparently knew all this before the rotation began; see\nquotation above). Second, in B21 and B21a he suggests how\nhuman nous (nous in us) can come to such an\nunderstanding by relying on sense perception but moving beyond it in\nthought (see sect. 5. Knowledge). Finally, because the ingredients are\ngenuinely basic entities in the sense required to ground a rational\ncosmology in the Eleatic sense, they must be stable natures in the\nParmenidean sense (for a related account, see Marmodoro\n2015). Anaxagoras is committed to the arguments that ground Eleatic\nmetaphysics; thus he can claim an a priori reason to think\nthat the ingredients can be knowable in the sense required by the\nPrinciple of Predominance.  His epistemological view that humans can\nreach understanding through beginning with sense experience then fits\nwith these metaphysical commitments.\n",
