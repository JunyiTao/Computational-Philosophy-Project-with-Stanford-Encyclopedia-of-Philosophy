The teaching of sancong \u4e09\u5f9e\nfirst appears in the Liji and is widely circulated in the\nlater Confucian\n texts.[9]\n As explained in the Liji in conjunction with the marriage\nrite:\n\n\nWomen are the ones who follow others; when they are young they follow\ntheir fathers and elder brothers, when they are married they follow\ntheir husbands, and when their husbands die they follow their sons.\n\u201cHusband\u201d denotes supporter. A husband uses wisdom to lead\nothers. (Liji, \u201cJiaotesheng\u201d\nchapter)\n\n\nTo be compliant was generally advised as the way of married women. As\nrecorded in the Mencius, \u201cTo look upon compliance\n(shun \u9806) as their correct course is the way of married\nwomen\u201d (3B2; for other translations see Lau 1970 [2003]).\n\nSince marriage is the only socially sanctioned venue open to women, to\nsuccessfully navigate the marriage life is essential for women; the\nteaching of \u201cfour [womanly] virtues\u201d (side\n\u56db\u5fb7) is meant to explicitly spell out four essential\nareas for women\u2019s self-cultivation, much like the teaching of\n\u201cfive social relations\u201d (wulun \u4e94\u502b)\nfor men as they journey outward from family, state, to the world at\nlarge (Mencius 3A4; Zhongyong, Ch. 20;\nDaxue). The teaching of side was first introduced in\nthe Liji as an intensive three-month training curriculum for\nthe bride-to-be in the context of the marriage rite; the betrothed\nyoung maiden is to be instructed on four areas of being a wife:\nvirtue, speech, comportment, and work (Liji,\n\u201cHunyi\u201d chapter). And Ban Zhao\u2019s\nN\u00fcjie then provided a clear summation and explanation of\nwhat each area consists of.\n\nThe basic tenet of side is diligence and sincerity; these\nfour areas of self-cultivation are achievable ideals for women in much\nthe same way as the virtue of ren \u4ec1 is an achievable\nideal for Confucius. As Ban Zhao wrote,\n\n\nThese four are women\u2019s utmost virtues, therefore one cannot be\nwithout them. With intentional sincerity, they are easy to accomplish.\nConfucius is said to have commented: \u201cIs ren far? If I\ndesire ren, ren is here. This is what it\nmeans\u201d. (N\u00fcjie, Ch. 4:\n\u201cFuxing\u201d; also see Analects 7.30)\n\n\nThe parity of side for women and ren as the highest\nConfucian ideal (for men) is clear. Even though the virtue of\nren is non-gendered in Confucian texts, the necessary\nconcentric expansion of one\u2019s moral cultivation from family,\nstate, to the world at large is not accessible to women, and hence in\neffect, the highest achievable moral ideal for women is side,\nthat focuses on practical training in the areas of ritual propriety,\ncautious speech, modest comportment, and household management in the\nroles of wife and mother.\n",
