    "main_text": "Ideological commitment\n3. Ideological commitment\n\nBecause their aim is clearly salvation, it has often been supposed\nthat the Ras\u00e2\u2019il were inspired by the\nSh\u00ee\u2018ites, or perhaps even the Ism\u00e2\u2018\u00eelis,\nboth of whom claim the ideological commitment of the encyclopedia. For\nMarquet (1975, 585) the encyclopedia is the most ancient general\nexposition of the Ism\u00e2\u2018\u00eeli doctrine. In 1150, the\nSunni orthodoxy in the person of the caliph al-Mustanjid judged the\nwork heretical and sent the existing versions to be burnt. Yet in\nspite of this, the encyclopedia survived and was translated into\nPersian and Turkish (Corbin, 1964, 193\u2013194). A harsh judgment on\nthe Ikhw\u00e2n was delivered by the famous Maml\u00fbk muft\u00ee\nand theologian Taq\u00ee al-D\u00een Ahmad ibn Taymiyya (d. 1328).\nHe considered them as Sh\u00ee\u2018i esotericists whose doctrines\ncontradict the religion of Islam. For this reason, he rejected the\nattribution of the Ras\u00e2\u2019il to such an eminent\nreligious scholar as Ja\u2018far al-S\u00e2diq (Michot 2008).\n\nAttempts to define the Ikhw\u00e2n's ideological commitment have been\nmade, but there has been no consensus on the matter. The\nIkhw\u00e2n's view of \u2018Al\u00ee as the Prophet's legitimate\nlegate (wal\u00ee) persuaded some scholars to link them to\nthe Sh\u00ee\u2018a, though scattered references in\nnegative terms to the \u201chidden\u201d im\u00e2m appear\ncontrary to twelver Sh\u00ee\u2018ism. Other elements have been\nalleged as proofs of the Ikhw\u00e2n's Ism\u00e2\u2018\u00eeli\ninspiration, such as the hierarchical structure of universe,\nreferences to septenary cycles, distinction between elect and masses,\nthe use of Ism\u00e2\u2018\u00eeli symbols (e.g., the bee as symbol\nof the im\u00e2m, etc.). Already Stanislas Guyard in 1874\npublished a fragment of the Ikhw\u00e2n reporting it to\nIsm\u00e2\u2018\u00eelism; and so Paul Casanova in 1898,\ndiscovering a manuscript of Ris\u00e2la al-J\u00e2mi\u2018a\n(Daftary 2007, 28 and 235; Hamdani, Soufan 2019,\n10\u201311). Corbin (1964, 190) openly and radically affirmed\nthat the Ikhw\u00e2n belonged to Ism\u00e2\u2018\u00eelism. He\ngave an esoterical interpretation of the religious, philosophical, and\nthe Brotherhood rites described in Epistle 50 On the kinds of\nadministration (Corbin 1950). Hamdani (1996, 146) considers this\ntreatise to be \"the most explicitly Sh\u00ee\u2018i or\nIsm\u00e2\u2018\u00eeli\" of the entire encyclopedia. The main lines\nof Corbin's presentation are shared, though in more nuanced terms, by\nMattila 2016. Corbin was followed by Marquet (1968, 1071) who stressed\ntheir attacks on Mu\u2018tazili and Ash\u2018arite ideas. Stern\n(1964, 416\u2013417) and Diwald (1975, 26ff.) remarked that the\nEpistles exercised their influence on the Ism\u00e2\u2018\u00eelis\nonly from the twelfth century. The concepts and historical ideas that\nare at least close to those of the Sh\u00ee\u2018a \u2013\nsuch as deprecation of the slaughter of Karbal\u00e2\u2019, the\nallegorical interpretation of the Qur\u2019\u00e2n and prophecy, or\nthe aversion to political governments and the hope that they will fall\nwhen the present septenary cycle comes to an end (cf. Baffioni 2019b)\n\u2013 show according to Stern (1964, 421) and later Bausani that the\nauthors were representative of an Ism\u00e2\u2018\u00eeli tendency,\nbut not of the official da\u2018wa (propaganda) (Bausani\n1978, 14\u201316; Bausani 1977, 323; Bausani 1978-1, 267, note 1).\nConsidering Epistles 50 and 48, Bausani agrees, albeit cautiously, on\nthe hypothesis of an Ism\u00e2\u2018\u00eelism of the Ikhw\u00e2n\n(Bausani 1978-1, 270; 278 and note 2), identified in their\n\u201cencyclopedic\u201d approach to knowledge (Bausani 1985, 145;\ncf. also Daftary 1998, 2 and 83). Marquet 1973, on the other hand,\nrecognizes in the encyclopedia (in Epistle 48 in particular, On\nthe invitation (da\u2018wa) to God) the official\nIsm\u00e2\u2018\u00eeli organization at the time (see also Marquet\n1981, 95; Marquet 1998, 5, 7\u20138), and remarks that the propaganda\nappeals here to philosophers, mystics, and rulers. According to\nHamdani (1996, 150), the event expected by the Ikhw\u00e2n is the\nadvent of the Fatimids. Epistle 48, Marquet claims, was written before\n910, and almost entirely preserved in its original form; but even if\nit was composed after the advent of the Fatimids, its meaning would\nnot have been perverted (Marquet 1984, 77\u201378). Other scholars\nhave remarked that even when discussing number seven, so linked to\nIsm\u00e2\u2018\u00eeliyya, the Ikhw\u00e2n criticize the\n\"supporters of the seven\" (Hamdani 1979, 68; Netton 1996,\n28\u201329). Non-Ism\u00e2\u2018\u00eeli ideas can also be found\nin the work, for example the invitation to celibacy proper of Sufism\n(but for contrary views see above). In general, the evidence\nsupporting such theories derives mostly from doctrines or parts of\ndoctrines hinted at in the encyclopedia. In denying the Brethren's\nIsm\u00e2\u2018\u00eeli commitment, for instance, Netton (1996, 28)\nremarks that, if the issue of such an allegiance is widely debated,\nscholars have much less addressed the \"broader topic [...] of whether\nthe Ikhw\u00e2n al-Saf\u00e2\u2019 should even be considered to be\nMuslims.\" The enormous variety of its contents and, often, their\ninconsistency seem to have hindered scholars from reaching unanimous\nconclusions on the authors' religious (or rather ideological)\ncommitment and, consequently, on their goals. The main lines of\nresearch in this field were resumed in Kraemer 1992, 165\u2013178;\ncf. Hamdani 1999, 79 ; Hamdani, Soufan 2019, 10ff.).\n",
