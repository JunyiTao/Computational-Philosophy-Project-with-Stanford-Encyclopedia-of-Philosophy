Part of the explanation for this\ndevelopment can be traced to the publication in 1958 of G. E. M.\nAnscombe\u2019s seminal article \u201cModern Moral\nPhilosophy.\u201d In that paper Anscombe argued that Kantianism and\nutilitarianism, the two major traditions in western moral philosophy,\nmistakenly placed the foundation for morality in legalistic notions\nsuch as duty and obligation. To do ethics properly, Anscombe argued,\none must start with what it is for a human being to flourish or live\nwell. That meant returning to some questions that mattered deeply to\nthe ancient Greek moralists. These questions focussed on the nature of\n\u201cvirtue\u201d (or what we might think of as admirable moral\ncharacter), of how one becomes virtuous (is it taught? does it arise\nnaturally? are we responsible for its development?), and of what\nrelationships and institutions may be necessary to make becoming\nvirtuous possible. Answers to these ancient questions emerge today in\nvarious areas of philosophy, including ethics (especially virtue\nethics), feminist ethics, political philosophy, philosophy of\neducation, and philosophy of literature. Interest in virtue and\ncharacter was also indirectly the result of a more practical turn in\npolitical philosophy, inspired by the publication of John\nRawls\u2019s A Theory of Justice in 1971. Especially in Part\nIII of A Theory of Justice, Rawls provided a picture of how\nindividuals might be brought up in a just state to develop the virtues\nexpected of good citizens. Although his interest was not in moral\neducation per se, his discussion of how individuals acquire a sense of\njustice and of how they develop what he called self-respect stimulated\nother philosophers to explore the psychological foundations of virtue\nand the contributions made by friendship, family, community, and\nmeaningful work to good moral character.\n\nThis entry provides a brief historical account of some important\ndevelopments in philosophical approaches to good moral character.\nApproximately half the entry is on the Greek moralists Socrates,\nPlato, Aristotle, and the Stoics. Of these, most attention is given to\nAristotle\u2019s views, since most other philosophical discussions of\ncharacter are indebted to his analysis. The latter half of the entry\nexplores how other philosophers have responded to the concerns first\nraised by the Greeks. Some philosophers, such as Hugo Grotius and\nImmanuel Kant, represent a \u201cmodern\u201d approach to character\nthat subordinates it to other moral notions such as duty and obedience\nto law. Other philosophers, such as David Hume, Karl Marx, John Stuart\nMill, and T. H. Green take an interest in the psychology of moral\ncharacter that is more reminiscent of the Greeks. Finally, this entry\nindicates the directions taken by some contemporary philosophers in\nrecent work on or related to moral character.\n", "toc": [{"#Ter": "1. Terminology"}, {"#SomAncGreVie": "2.

Terminology\n\nThe English word \u201ccharacter\u201d is derived from the Greek\ncharakt\u00ear, which was originally used of a mark\nimpressed upon a coin. Later and more generally,\n\u201ccharacter\u201d came to mean a distinctive mark by which one\nthing was distinguished from others, and then primarily to mean the\nassemblage of qualities that distinguish one individual from another.\nIn modern usage, this emphasis on distinctiveness or individuality\ntends to merge \u201ccharacter\u201d with \u201cpersonality.\u201d\nWe might say, for example, when thinking of a person\u2019s\nidiosyncratic mannerisms, social gestures, or habits of dress, that\n\u201che has personality\u201d or that \u201che\u2019s quite a\ncharacter.\u201d\n\nAs the Introduction above has suggested, however, the philosophical\nuse of the word \u201ccharacter\u201d has a different linguistic\nhistory. At the beginning of Book II of the Nicomachean\nEthics, Aristotle tells us that there are two different kinds of\nhuman excellences, excellences of thought and excellences of\ncharacter. His phrase for excellences of character \u2013\n\u00eathikai aretai \u2013 we usually translate as\n\u201cmoral virtue(s)\u201d or \u201cmoral excellence(s).\u201d\nThe Greek \u00eathikos (ethical) is the adjective cognate\nwith \u00eathos (character). When we speak of a moral virtue\nor an excellence of character, the emphasis is not on mere\ndistinctiveness or individuality, but on the combination of qualities\nthat make an individual the sort of ethically admirable person he\nis.\n\nThis entry will discuss \u201cmoral character\u201d in the Greek\nsense of having or lacking moral virtue. If someone lacks virtue, she\nmay have any of several moral vices, or she may be characterized by a\ncondition somewhere in between virtue and vice, such as continence or\nincontinence.\n2. Some ancient Greek views\n2.1 Why character matters\n\nThe views of moral character held by Socrates, Plato, Aristotle, and\nthe Stoics are the starting point for most other philosophical\ndiscussions of character. Although these ancient moralists differed on\nsome issues about virtue, it makes sense to begin with some points of\nsimilarity. These points of similarity will show why the Greek\nmoralists thought it was important to discuss character.\n\nMany of Plato\u2019s dialogues (especially the early or so-called\n\u201cSocratic\u201d dialogues) examine the nature of virtue and the\ncharacter of a virtuous person. They often begin by having Socrates\nask his interlocutors to explain what a particular virtue is. In\nreply, the interlocutors usually offer behavioral accounts of the\nvirtues. For example, at the beginning of Plato\u2019s\nLaches the character Laches suggests that courage consists of\nstanding one\u2019s ground in battle. In the Charmides,\nCharmides suggests that temperance consists in acting quietly. In the\nRepublic, Cephalus suggests that justice consists in giving\nback what one has borrowed. In each of these cases, Plato has Socrates\nreply in the same way. In the Republic Socrates explains that\ngiving back what one has borrowed cannot be what justice is, for there\nare cases where giving back what one has borrowed would be foolish,\nand the just person recognizes that it is foolish. If the person from\nwhom you have borrowed a sword goes mad, it would be foolish for you\nto return the sword, for you are then putting yourself and others in\ndanger. The implication is that the just person can recognize when it\nis reasonable to return what he has borrowed. Similarly, as Socrates\nexplains in the Laches, standing firm in battle cannot be\ncourage, for sometimes standing firm in battle is simply a foolish\nendurance that puts oneself and others at needless risk. The\ncourageous person can recognize when it is reasonable to stand his\nground in battle and when it isn\u2019t.\n\nThe trouble one encounters in trying to give a purely behavioral\naccount of virtue explains why the Greek moralists turn to character\nto explain what virtue is. It may be true that most of us can\nrecognize that it would be foolish to risk our lives and the lives of\nothers to secure a trivial benefit, and that most of us can see that\nit is unjust to harm others to secure power and wealth for our own\ncomfort. We don\u2019t have to be virtuous to recognize these things.\nBut the Greek moralists think it takes someone of good moral character\nto determine with regularity and reliability what actions are\nappropriate and reasonable in fearful situations and that it takes\nsomeone of good moral character to determine with regularity and\nreliability how and when to secure goods and resources for himself and\nothers. This is why Aristotle states in Nicomachean Ethics\nII.9 that it is not easy to define in rules which actions deserve\nmoral praise and blame, and that these matters require the judgment of\nthe virtuous person.\n2.2 Virtue and happiness\n\nMost of the Greek moralists think that, if we are rational, we aim at\nliving well (eu z\u00ean) or happiness\n(eudaimonia). Living well or happiness is our ultimate end in\nthat a conception of happiness serves to organize our various\nsubordinate ends, by indicating the relative importance of our ends\nand by indicating how they should fit together into some rational\noverall scheme. So the Stoics identify happiness with \u201cliving\ncoherently\u201d (homologoumen\u00f4s z\u00ean), and\nAristotle says that happiness is \u201cperfect\u201d or\n\u201ccomplete\u201d (teleios) and something distinctively\nhuman. When we are living well, our life is worthy of imitation and\npraise. For, according to the Greek moralists, that we are happy says\nsomething about us and about what we have achieved, not simply about\nthe fortunate circumstances in which we find ourselves. So they argue\nthat happiness cannot consist simply in \u201cexternal goods\u201d\nor \u201cgoods of fortune,\u201d for these goods are external to our\nown choosing and deciding. Whatever happiness is, it must take account\nof the fact that a happy life is one lived by rational agents who act\nand who are not simply victims of their circumstances.\n\nThe Greek moralists conclude that a happy life must give a prominent\nplace to the exercise of virtue, for virtuous traits of character are\nstable and enduring and are not products of fortune, but of learning\nor cultivation. Moreover, virtuous traits of character are excellences\nof the human being in that they are the best exercise of reason, which\nis the activity characteristic of human beings. In this way, the Greek\nphilosophers claim, virtuous activity completes or perfects human\nlife.\n2.3 Some Greek disagreements about virtue\n\nAlthough the Greek philosophers agree that happiness requires virtue\nand hence that a happy person must have virtuous traits of character\nsuch as wisdom, bravery, temperance, and justice, they disagree about\nhow to understand these traits. As explained in Section 2.1 above,\nseveral of Plato\u2019s dialogues criticize the view that virtues are\nmerely tendencies to act in particular ways. Bravery requires more\nthan standing up against threats to oneself and others. Bravery also\nrequires recognizing when standing up to these threats is reasonable\nand appropriate, and it requires acting on one\u2019s recognition.\nThis led the Greek moralists to conclude that virtuous traits of\ncharacter have two aspects: (a) a behavioral aspect \u2013 doing\nparticular kinds of action and (b) a psychological aspect \u2013\nhaving the right motives, aims, concerns, and perspective. The Greek\nphilosophers disagree mostly about what (b) involves. In particular,\nthey differ about the role played in virtuous traits of character by\ncognitive states (e.g., knowledge and belief) on the one hand and\naffective states (e.g., desires, feelings, and emotions) on the other.\nSocrates and the Stoics argued that only cognitive states were\nnecessary for virtue, whereas Plato and Aristotle argued that both\ncognitive and affective states were necessary.\nSocrates (469\u2013399 BCE)\n\nIn Plato\u2019s Protagoras, Socrates seems to identify\nhappiness with pleasure and to explain the various virtues as\ninstrumental means to pleasure. On this view (later revived by\nEpicurus, 341\u2013271 BCE), having a virtuous character is purely a\nmatter of being knowledgeable of what brings us more pleasure rather\nthan less. In the Protagoras, Socrates recognizes that most\npeople object to this view. The \u201cmany\u201d suppose that having\na virtuous character requires more than knowledge, because knowledge\ndoes not guarantee that one will act on one\u2019s knowledge and do\nthe virtuous action. Someone may be overcome by anger, fear, lust, and\nother desires, and act against what he believes will bring him more\npleasure rather than less. He can, in other words, be incontinent or\nweak-willed. Socrates replies that such cases should be understood\ndifferently. When, for example, a cowardly person flees from battle\nrather than endanger his life, even though he may seem to be pursuing\nthe more pleasant action, he is really just ignorant of the greater\npleasure to be achieved by entering battle and acting bravely. In\nother words, incontinence is not possible, according to Socrates. \nPlato (428\u2013347 BCE)\n\nThe \u201cmany\u201d\u2019s worry about the inadequacy of knowledge\nto ensure virtuous action suggests that virtuous character includes\nnot only a cognitive element, but also some affective element. Both\nPlato and Aristotle argue that virtuous character requires a\ndistinctive combination of cognitive and affective elements. In the\nRepublic, Plato divides the soul into three parts and gives\nto each a different kind of desire (rational, appetitive, or\nspirited). As types of non-rational desire, appetitive and spirited\ndesires can conflict with our rational desires about what contributes\nto our overall good, and they will sometimes move us to act in ways we\nrecognize to be against our greater good. When that happens, we are\nincontinent. To be virtuous, then, we must both understand what\ncontributes to our overall good and have our spirited and appetitive\ndesires educated properly, so that they agree with the guidance\nprovided by the rational part of the soul. Plato describes the\neducation of the non-rational parts of the soul in Books II and III of\nthe Republic. A potentially virtuous person learns when young\nto love and take pleasure in virtuous actions, but must wait until\nlate in life to develop the understanding that explains why what he\nloves is good. Once he has learned what the good is, his informed love\nof the good explains why he acts as he does and why his actions are\nvirtuous. \n2.4 Aristotle (384\u2013322 BCE)\n\nAristotle accepts Plato\u2019s division of the soul into two basic\nparts (rational and non-rational) and agrees that both parts\ncontribute to virtuous character. Of all the Greek moralists,\nAristotle provides the most psychologically insightful account of\nvirtuous character. Because many modern philosophical treatments of\ncharacter (see Sections 3 and 4 below) are indebted to\nAristotle\u2019s analysis, it is best to discuss his position in some\ndetail.\nAristotle\u2019s definition of good moral character\n\nAristotle defines virtuous character in Nicomachean Ethics\nII.6: \n\nExcellence [of character], then, is a state concerned with choice,\nlying in a mean relative to us, this being determined by reason and in\nthe way in which the man of practical wisdom (phronimos)\nwould determine it. Now it is a mean between two vices, that which\ndepends on excess and that which depends on defect.\n(1106b36\u20131107a3)\n\n\nBy calling excellence of character a state, Aristotle means that it is\nneither a feeling nor a capacity nor a mere tendency to behave in\nspecific ways. Rather it is the settled condition we are in when we\nare well off in relation to feelings and actions. We are well off in\nrelation to our feelings and actions when we are in a mean or\nintermediate state in regard to them. If, on the other hand, we have a\nvicious character, we are badly off in relation to feelings and\nactions, and we fail to hit the mean in regard to them.\n\nSo it is not easy to hit the mean. \u201cAnyone can get angry \u2013\nthat is easy \u2013 or give or spend money; but to do this to the\nright person, to the right extent, at the right time, with the right\naim, and in the right way, that is not for everyone, nor is it\neasy.\u201d That is why goodness is praiseworthy (epaineton)\nand fine (kalon) (Nicomachean Ethics\n1109a26\u201330).\nVirtue as a mean state\n\nAristotle emphasizes that the mean state is not an arithmetic mean,\nbut one relative to the situation. The different particular virtues\nprovide illustrations of what Aristotle means. Each virtue is set over\nor concerned with specific feelings or actions. The virtue of mildness\nor good temper, for example, is concerned with anger. Aristotle thinks\nthat a mild person ought to be angry about some things (e.g.,\ninjustice and other forms of mistreatment) and should be willing to\nstand up for himself and those he cares about. Not to do so would, in\nAristotle\u2019s view, indicate the morally deficient character of\nthe inirascible person. It would also be inappropriate to take offense\nand get angry if there is nothing worth getting angry about. That\nresponse would indicate the morally excessive character of the\nirascible person. The mild person\u2019s reactions are appropriate to\nthe situation. Sometimes intense anger is appropriate; at other times\ncalm detachment is. \nThe psychological unity of the virtuous person and the disunity of non-virtuous conditions\n\nThat the virtuous person\u2019s emotional responses are appropriate\nto the situation indicates that her emotional responses are in harmony\nwith her correct reasoning about what to do. Aristotle says that the\nnon-rational part of a virtuous person\u2019s soul \u201cspeaks with\nthe same voice\u201d (homoph\u00f4nei, Nicomachean\nEthics 1102b28) as the rational part. That the virtuous\nperson\u2019s soul is unified and not torn by conflict distinguishes\nthe state of being virtuous from various non-virtuous conditions such\nas continence (enkrateia), incontinence (akrasia),\nand vice (kakia) in general. \n\nAristotle seems to think that, at bottom, any non-virtuous person is\nplagued by inner doubt or conflict, even if on the surface she appears\nto be as psychologically unified as virtuous people. Although a\nvicious person may appear to be single-minded about her disdain for\njustice and her pursuit of material goods and power, she must seek out\nothers\u2019 company to forget or ignore her own actions. Aristotle\nseems to have this point in mind when he says of vicious people in\nNicomachean Ethics IX.4 that they are at odds with themselves\nand do not love themselves. Virtuous persons, on the other hand, enjoy\nwho they are and take pleasure in acting virtuously.\n\nLike the morally vicious person, the continent and incontinent persons\nare internally conflicted, but they are more aware of their inner\nturmoil than the morally vicious person. Continence is essentially a\nkind of self-mastery: the continent person recognizes what she should\ndo and does it, but to do so she must struggle against the pull of\nrecalcitrant feelings. The incontinent person also in some way knows\nwhat she should do, but she fails to do it because of recalcitrant\nfeelings.\n\nAristotle\u2019s position on incontinence seems to incorporate both\nSocratic and Platonic elements. Recall that Socrates had explained\napparently incontinent behavior as the result of ignorance of what\nleads to the good. Since, he thought, everyone desires the good and\naims at it in his actions, no one would intentionally choose a course\nof action believed to yield less good overall. Plato, on the other\nhand, argued that incontinence can occur when a person\u2019s\nnon-rational desires move him to act in ways not endorsed by his\nrational desire for the greater good. Aristotle seems to agree with\nSocrates that the cognitive state of the incontinent person is\ndefective at the moment of incontinent behavior, but he also agrees\nwith Plato that a person\u2019s non-rational desires cause the\nincontinent action. This may be what Aristotle means when he writes\nthat \u201cthe position that Socrates sought to establish actually\nseems to result; for it is not what is thought to be knowledge proper\nthat the passion overcomes \u2026 but perceptual knowledge\u201d\n(Nicomachean Ethics, 1147b14\u201317).\nMoral education and the human function\n\nBecause Aristotle thinks that virtue is a unified, unconflicted state\nwhere emotional responses and rational assessments speak with the same\nvoice, he, like Plato, thinks that the education of our emotional\nresponses is crucial for the development of virtuous character. If our\nemotional responses are educated properly, we will learn to take\npleasure or pain in the right things. Like Plato, Aristotle thinks\nthat we can take a person\u2019s pleasures and pains to be a sign of\nhis state of character. \n\nTo explain what the virtuous person\u2019s pleasures are like,\nAristotle returns to the idea that virtue is an excellent state of the\nperson. Virtue is the state that makes a human being good and makes\nhim perform his function well (Nicomachean Ethics\n1106a15\u201324). His function (his ergon or characteristic\nactivity) is rational activity, so when we exercise our fully\ndeveloped rational powers well, when we realize our nature as rational\nbeings, we are good (virtuous) human beings and live well (we are\nhappy) (Nicomachean Ethics, I.7). \n\nAccording to Aristotle, human beings can reason in ways that non-human\nanimals cannot. They can deliberate about what to do, about what kind\nof lives to live, about what sort of persons to be. They can look for\nreasons to act or live one way rather than another. In other words,\nthey can engage in practical reasoning. They can also think about the\nnature of the world and why it seems to behave as it does. They can\nconsider scientific and metaphysical truths about the universe. This\nis to engage in theoretical reasoning (\u201ccontemplation\u201d or\nthe\u00f4ria). There is no agreement among scholars as to\nwhether, and how, these types of reasoning can be distinguished. (For\na discussion of theoretical and practical reason in Aristotle, see the\nrelated entry on\n Aristotle\u2019s ethics.)\n But as we shall see when we discuss Aristotle\u2019s\nPolitics, we can assume, for the purposes of this discussion,\nthat theoretical and practical rational activity are at least related\ntypes of rational activity, in that each involves exercising\none\u2019s abilities to think and to know and to consider truths that\none has figured out.\n\nHow do one realize these powers fully? Not by becoming adept at every\nkind of activity in which deliberating and judging on the basis of\nreason is called for. For then one would have to master every kind of\ncultural, scientific, and philosophical activity. Rather,\nAristotle\u2019s idea is that an individual develops these abilities\nto the extent that he enjoys and values the exercise of his realized\nrational powers in a wide variety of different and even seemingly\nunconnected activities. When that happens, his exercise of these\nabilities is a continuing source of self-esteem and enjoyment. He\ncomes to like his life and himself and is now a genuine self-lover\n(Nicomachean Ethics 1168b28\u20131169a3).\n\nIn Nicomachean Ethics) IX.8, Aristotle clarifies the motives\nand reasoning of virtuous people by contrasting genuine self-love with\na defective type that is reproachable. People with reproachable\nself-love want most to have the biggest share of money, honors, and\nbodily pleasures (cf. Nicomachean Ethics I.5). Because one\nperson cannot have a big share without denying these goods to others,\nthese are the goods that are contested and fought over. This\ncompetitive approach to these external goods leads to all sorts of\nmorally vicious behavior, for example, overreaching\n(pleonexia), aggression, wasteful luxury, intemperance,\nboastfulness, and vanity. In contrast to reproachable self-lovers,\ngenuine self-lovers will take pleasure in the right things (they will\nenjoy the exercise of their deliberative and decision-making powers\nrather than the accumulation of wealth or power). As a result, they\nwill avoid many of the actions, and will be unattracted to many of the\npleasures, of the common vices. Because they have the proper attitude\ntoward external goods, they will be ready to sacrifice such goods if\nby doing so they achieve what is fine. They recognize that when\neveryone concentrates on doing what is fine, their actions promote the\ncommon good (Nicomachean Ethics 1169a6). The virtuous\nperson\u2019s reasoning reflects his correct conception of how to\nlive (he has phron\u00easis or practical wisdom) and his\nconcern for the fine: he sees that his own good is included in the\ngood of the community (Nicomachean Ethics\n1169a3\u20136).\nThe need for relationships and community\n\nBecause an individual\u2019s good is included in the good of\ncommunity, the full realization of an individual\u2019s rational\npowers is not something he can achieve or maintain on his own. It is\nhard, Aristotle says in Nicomachean Ethics IX.9, for a\nsolitary person to be continuously active, but it is easier with\nothers. To realize our powers fully we need at least a group of\ncompanions who share our interests and with whom we can cooperate to\nachieve our mutually recognized goals. In this kind of cooperative\nactivity, we are parts of a larger enterprise, so that when others\nact, it is as though we are acting, too. In this way, these activities\nexpand our conception of who \u201cwe\u201d are, and they make the\nuse of our powers more continuous and more stable. Examples listed by\nAristotle include sailors on a ship, soldiers on an expedition,\nmembers of families, business relationships, religious associations,\ncitizens of a political community, and colleagues engaged in\ncontemplative activity. As Aristotle explains in Rhetoric\nII.4, if we and our cooperative partners do their parts responsibly,\neach will develop feelings of friendship for the others involved. In\nthis way, successful cooperative activity transforms persons\u2019\ndesires and motivations. Although we may have initiated activity for\nself-interested reasons, the psychological result is that we come to\nlike our cooperative partners and to develop a concern for their good\nfor their own sakes. This change, Aristotle indicates, is caused to\noccur in us. It is not chosen. Once bonds of friendship are formed, it\nis natural for us to exhibit the social virtues Aristotle describes in\nNicomachean Ethics IV.6\u20138, which include generosity,\nfriendliness, and mildness of temper. \n\nAristotle thinks that, in addition to friendships, wider social\nrelations are required for the full development of our rational\npowers. He says in Nicomachean Ethics I.7 that we are by\nnature political beings, whose capacities are fully realized in a\nspecific kind of political community (a polis or city-state).\nAristotle\u2019s ideal political community is led by citizens who\nrecognize the value of living fully active lives and whose aim is to\nmake the best life possible for their fellow citizens, thereby\npromoting the common good (Politics 1278b19\u201326, cf.\n1280b8\u201312). When citizens deliberate and legislate about the\ncommunity\u2019s educational, office-holding, and economic policies,\ntheir goal is to determine and promote the conditions under which\ncitizens can fully develop their deliberative and decision-making\npowers (Politics 1332b12\u201341).\n\nThus Aristotle recommends in Politics VII-VIII that the city\nprovide a system of public education for all citizens, a\nrecommendation that was radical for his time. He envisions that young\npeople will learn not simply to read and write, but also to appreciate\nthe beauty of the world around them and to gain some understanding of\nhow the universe works. If education is successful, young people will\nwant to use their powers in deciding, judging, and discriminating.\nThey will then be well-positioned to take their place as\ndecision-makers in the citizen assembly and judicial system and,\nbecause of sortition and a system of office rotation, as eventual\nholders of public office. The city\u2019s economic policies support\nthe aim of the political and educational institutions. Because\nAristotle sees that citizens need material resources if they are to\nparticipate fully in public life, he recommends that the state\ndistribute parcels of land to all. Yet there is no need, in his view,\nto establish economic equality, as long as existing inequalities are\nnot large enough to promote the formation of elite groups or to\nprovoke justified anger or envy. These various policies \u2013\neducational, political, economic \u2013 make it possible for a sense\nof justice to pervade the city, as they serve to confirm that all\ncitizens are valued as equal practical deliberators and\npolicy-makers.\n\nAristotle\u2019s criticisms of deviant political states take a\nrelated line: states that encourage the consumption and accumulation\nof external goods for their own sake, or states that promote warfare\nand military supremacy as an end in itself, mistake the nature of the\nbest human life. Citizens of such states will grow up to love most\nsomething other than the exercise of realized human rational powers,\nand as a result they will be prone to such traditional vices as\ninjustice, lack of generosity, and intemperance. \n\nThat living well requires active political deliberation and\npolicy-making explains why Aristotle excludes natural slaves, women,\nand manual workers from citizenship, and helps to clarify his view\nthat citizens should be private property-owners. In Aristotle\u2019s\nview, natural slaves lack the capacity for deliberation and\ndecision-making that is required for living well. Women have a\ndeliberative capacity, but it is not \u201cauthoritative.\u201d\nManual laborers are occupied with the production of necessities. They\nhave decision-making powers, but their exercise is limited by the\nlaborer\u2019s need to survive, for he must conform to the demands of\nhis working conditions. Moreover, manual work is often dull and\nrepetitive, making little demand on workers\u2019 rational powers.\nAs private property-owners, citizens are not vulnerable to these\nproblems. With private property, an individual has a supply of\nresources that is under his control; his decision determines what\nhappens to it. Thus he is able to take pleasure from generous action\n\u2013 from helping his friends, guests, and companions.\n\nFor more detailed discussion of the relation between Aristotle\u2019s\nethical and political views, see Irwin (1985, 1996, 2007), Kraut\n(2002) and Schofield (2006). On Aristotle\u2019s discussions of\nfriendship, see Cooper (1980). \nSummary\n\nPlato and Aristotle agree that excellent moral character involves more\nthan a Socratic understanding of the good. They think that virtue\nrequires a harmony between cognitive and affective elements of the\nperson. Aristotle tries to explain what this harmony consists in by\nexploring the psychological foundations of moral character. He thinks\nthat the virtuous person is characterized by a nonstereotypical\nself-love that he understands as a love of the exercise of fully\nrealized rational activity. Yet this self-love is not an individual\nachievement. Its development and preservation require (a) friendships\nin which individuals desire the good of others for others\u2019 own\nsakes and (b) a political community where citizens are equal and\nsimilar, and where political and economic arrangements promote the\nconditions under which self-love and friendship flourish. \n2.5 Stoic views of character\n\nThe Stoic school of philosophy existed for about five centuries, from\nits founding around 300 BCE to the second century CE. Like Socrates,\nPlato, and Aristotle, the Stoic philosophers differed on some issues\nabout the virtues, but they seemed also to have shared a common core\nof views. This section of the entry on character will briefly discuss\ntheir common views.\n\nThe Stoic philosophers have a view of character that is close to\nSocrates\u2019, but they reach it through agreement with Aristotle.\nThe Stoics assume that the good life for human beings is a life in\naccord with nature. They agree with Aristotle that the human\nbeing\u2019s essence is a life in accord with reason. So to find what\naccords with nature, they look to the development of the human\nbeing\u2019s rational powers. They think that as a person begins to\nuse reason instrumentally to satisfy and organize his desires and\nappetites, he comes to value the exercise of reason for its own sake.\nHe realizes that conduct that exhibits a rational order is far more\nvaluable than any of the natural advantages (such as health,\nfriendship, or community) pursued by his individual actions. Human\ngood, after all, as Aristotle argued, should be stable, under our\ncontrol, and hard to take from us. The Stoics conclude that human good\nconsists in excellent rational activity, for a person can guide his\nactions by rational choice, no matter what misfortunes he may\nencounter. The virtuous person becomes the sage (sophos) who\nhas and acts on knowledge of the good. His actions are informed by his\ninsights about the advantages of perfecting one\u2019s rationality by\nacting in agreement with the rational order of nature. Like Socrates,\nthe Stoic view of virtue focuses on the virtuous person\u2019s\ncognitive state: it is his knowledge of the rational order of the\nuniverse and his desire to accord with that rational order that leads\nhim to act as he does.\n\nTo be virtuous, there is no need to develop any capacities other than\ncognitive capacities, for the Stoics claim against Plato and Aristotle\nthat there is really no non-rational part of the soul. Although the\nStoics admit that there are passions such as anger, fear, and so on,\nthey treat them as mistaken judgments about what is good and evil.\nSince the sage or virtuous person is wise and has no mistaken\njudgments about the good, he has no passions. So if the sage loses any\nnatural advantages in misfortune, he has no emotion about them.\nRather, he views them as \u201cindifferents\u201d\n(adiaphora). One might wonder, then, how the sage can truly\nbe said to be virtuous. For if he views the health and welfare of\nhimself and others as indifferents, why would he act to secure or\nprotect his or others\u2019 welfare, as presumably a virtuous person\nwould? The Stoics reply that natural advantages are still pursued, but\nonly to achieve agreement with nature and to realize fully one\u2019s\nrational powers. They are \u201cpreferred indifferents.\u201d\n\nUnlike Plato and Aristotle, the Stoics did not think virtue was\ndeveloped and sustained by any particular kind of community. Granted,\nsocial relationships and community are among the preferred\nindifferents in that they are to be preferred to the opposite\nconditions of hostility, war, and enmity. But they are not necessary\nfor anyone\u2019s happiness. If we lose them, it is not a loss of a\ngenuine good. So the Stoic Epictetus (c. 55\u2013c.135), a freed slave,\nargued that the death of one\u2019s family members is no real loss\nand is no worse than the breaking of a cup. The community that did\nmatter to the Stoics was cosmic. When persons achieve perfect\nrationality, they accord with the rational order of a universe ruled\nby divine reason. This shows that all of us, virtuous or not, are\nruled by one law and so belong to one universal community. As rational\nbeings, we recognize this for we recognize that we share reason with\nother human beings. The Stoic Marcus Aurelius (121\u2013180), a Roman\nemperor, makes the connections in this way: \u201cIf this be so\n[i.e., that reason is shared], then also the reason which enjoins what\nis to be done or left undone is common. If this be so, law also is\ncommon; if this be so, we are citizens; if this be so, we are\npartakers in one constitution; if this be so, the Universe is a kind\nof Commonwealth\u201d (Marcus Aurelius, The Meditations,\niv.4). The Stoics concluded that, as rational beings, we have no\nreason not to extend our concern beyond our family, friends, and\nimmediate community to our fellow-citizens of the world community.\n\nThe Stoics came to represent a way of life according to which someone\nmight strive for the well-being of others, whether friend or stranger,\nwithout caring about material rewards or worldly success. Because\ntheir view of virtue was independent of any particular social or\npolitical structure, their message held an appeal for all sorts of\npeople, Greek or non-Greek, slave or free, rich or poor.\n\nFor more detailed discussion of Greek views of character, see Dent\n(1975), Irwin (1989, 1996), and Sherman (1989).\n3. Virtue and moral character after the Greeks\n\nSince the publication of Anscombe\u2019s \u201cModern Moral\nPhilosophy\u201d in 1958 (see Introduction above), it has become\nroutine to say that virtue and moral character have been neglected\ntopics in the development of western moral philosophy since the\nGreeks. Rather than thinking about what it is to flourish and live\nwell, moral philosophers, it is argued, became focused on a different\nset of notions: obligation, duty, and law.\n\nAnscombe and others have suggested how such a move might have taken\nplace. The Stoic ideas outlined above may have influenced early\nChristians such as St. Paul to develop the idea of a natural law that\napplies to all human beings. Once Christianity became more widespread,\nnatural law could be understood in terms of God\u2019s directives in\nthe Bible. Still later, after the European political revolutions of\nthe 17th and 18th centuries, there was\nintellectual room for secularized versions of the same idea to take\nhold: duty or obligation was understood in terms of obedience to moral\nlaw(s) or principles that do not come from God but are devised by\nhuman beings. Morally right action was action in accord with moral\nlaw(s) or principles. On such a view, where the central focus is on\nobedience to moral law, the virtues and moral character are secondary\nto action in accordance with law. Someone who acts rightly may develop\nstanding habits or dispositions of doing so, and these habits then\nconstitute the virtues or good character.\n\nThis section of the entry on moral character will provide a brief\nsummary of some important developments both in this\n\u201cmodern\u201d approach to moral character and in what appear to\nbe revivals of the pre-Christian Greek interest in the psychological\nfoundations of character.\n3.1 Early natural law theorists\n\nIn the writings of the early natural law theorists, Greek views of\nvirtue sometimes came under strong criticism. Hugo Grotius\n(1583\u20131645), for example, objected to Aristotle\u2019s approach\nto virtue and especially to his attempts to find a mean in terms of\nwhich to understand justice. It does not matter, Grotius complained,\nwhat moves someone to act unjustly \u2013 the only thing that matters\nis that unjust action violates the rights of others. Grotius\nacknowledged that one may develop emotional habits that support right\naction, but he thought this was a matter of having reason control\npassions and emotions so that they do not interfere with right action.\nThat reason should control passions indicates that the desired state\nis for one part of us to rule the other, not for both parts, in\nAristotle\u2019s words, to speak with the same voice. On this view,\nmoral character is a state closer to what the Greeks considered\nself-mastery or continence than it is to what they considered virtue.\n\n\nEven though the natural law theorists tended to assimilate virtue to\ncontinence, they still admitted that that there was an area of moral\nlife in which motive and character mattered. That was the area of\n\u201cimperfect duty\u201d (as contrasted with \u201cperfect\nduty\u201d). Under a perfect duty what is owed is specific and\nlegally enforceable by political society or courts; but action in\naccord with imperfect duty cannot be compelled, and what is owed under\nan imperfect duty is imprecise. Generosity is an example of the\nlatter, justice of the former. In the case of generosity, one has a\nduty to be generous, but one cannot be legally compelled to be\ngenerous, and when or how generosity is shown is not precisely\nspecifiable. But in the case of generosity, the motive of the agent\ncounts. For if I give money to a poor person I encounter on the street\nand do so because I want others to think well of me, I have not acted\ngenerously and performed my imperfect duty. When I give generously, I\nmust do so out of concern for the good of the person to whom I give\nthe money.\n\nFor more detailed discussion of Grotius and the natural law theorists,\nand of the modern developments Anscombe attacked, see Schneewind\n(1990, 1998). For a discussion of the persistence of Aristotelian\nethics in the early modern period and a response to Schneewind, see\nFrede (2013).\n3.2 Kant\n\nThe tendencies to find room for motive and character in the area of\nimperfect duty, and to assimilate virtue with continence, resurface in\nthe writings of several moral philosophers of the 17th and\n18th centuries. Immanuel Kant (1724\u20131804) is an\nillustrative case. In the Metaphysics of Morals, Kant divides\nmoral philosophy into two domains, that of justice or law on the one\nhand (the Doctrine of Right), and that of ethics or virtue on\nthe other (the Doctrine of Virtue). The duties that form the\nsubject matter of the Doctrine of Right are like the natural\nlaw theorists\u2019 perfect duties: they are precise, owed to\nspecifiable others, and can be legally enforced. They require that we\ntake or forego certain actions. Other duties (which form the subject\nmatter of the Doctrine of Virtue) are duties to adopt certain\nends. Many of them are imperfect, in that they do not specify how,\nwhen, or for whom (in the case of duties to others) they should be\nachieved. Examples are the duty not to let one\u2019s talents rust or\nthe duty not to deny help to others. Because we cannot be compelled to\nadopt ends, but must do so from free choice, these duties are not\nlegally enforceable. They require inner, not outer, legislation, so we\nmust impose them on ourselves. Because, according to Kant, we are\nalways fighting against the impulses and dispositions that oppose the\nmoral law, we need strength of will and self-mastery to fulfill our\nimperfect duties. This self-mastery Kant calls courage. \n\nThat virtue is a form of continence for Kant is also suggested by his\ntreatment of other traits such as gratitude and sympathy. Although\nKant thinks that feelings cannot be required of anyone, some feelings\nare nevertheless associated with the moral ends we adopt. If we adopt\nothers\u2019 happiness as an end, we will not take malicious pleasure\nin their downfall. On the contrary, we will naturally feel gratitude\nfor their benevolence and sympathy for their happiness. These feelings\nwill make it easier for us to perform our duties and are a sign that\nwe are disposed to do so. Kant remarks of sympathy that \u201cit is\none of the impulses that nature has implanted in us to do what the\nrepresentation of duty alone would not accomplish\u201d (Kant,\nMetaphysics of Morals, Ak. 457).\n\nThus it matters to Kant that we perform the duties of virtue with the\nproperly cultivated emotions. But to do so is not to develop our\nnature so that the two parts of us, reason and passion, are unified\nand speak with the same voice. Rather, if we perform our duties of\nvirtue in the right spirit, one part of us, reason, retains control\nover the other part, passion. Kant writes that virtue \u201ccontains\na positive command to a man, namely to bring all his capacities and\ninclinations under his (reason\u2019s) control and so to rule over\nhimself \u2026 for unless reason holds the reins of government in\nits own hands, man\u2019s feelings and inclinations play the master\nover him\u201d (Kant, Metaphysics of Morals, Ak. 408).\n\nFor more detailed discussion of Kant\u2019s views on virtue, see\nO\u2019Neill (1996).\n\nYet there are other philosophers for whom an interest in virtue or\ngood character takes a turn more reminiscent of the Greeks. This\nrevival of Greek ideas can be seen in philosophers who show an\ninterest in the psychological foundations of good character.\n3.3 Hume\n\nDavid Hume (1711\u20131776) explicitly professes a preference for\nancient ethics (Hume, Enquiries, 318), claiming that morals\nare the one science in which the ancients are not surpassed by the\nmoderns (Hume, Enquiries, 330). Like some of the Greek\nmoralists, Hume thought morality must be rooted in our passional\nnature. For morality moves us to action whereas reason alone, Hume\nthought, does not. His preference for ancient ethics is most obviously\nseen in his focus on the nature of the virtues and in his efforts to\nexplain how virtues arise from our feelings and desires.\n\nHume divides the virtues into two types: artificial and natural.\nArtificial virtues include justice, promise-keeping, and allegiance to\nlegitimate government. Natural virtues include courage, magnanimity,\nambition, friendship, generosity, fidelity, and gratitude, among many\nothers. Whereas each exercise of the natural virtues normally produces\ngood results, the good of artificial virtues is indirect in that it\ncomes about only as a result of there being an accepted practice of\nexercising these virtues.\n\nHume\u2019s discussion of justice illustrates how the artificial\nvirtues emerge from our feelings and desires. Hume notes that\nfollowing the rules of justice does not always produce good results.\nConsider the judges who \u201cbestow on the dissolute the labour of\nthe industrious; and put into the hands of the vicious the means of\nharming both themselves and others\u201d (Hume, Treatise,\n579). Hume thinks that as persons become aware that stability of\npossessions is advantageous to each individually, they also realize\nthat stability is not possible unless everyone refrains from\ndisturbing others\u2019 possessions. As this awareness becomes more\nwidespread and effective in people\u2019s behaviors, there arises a\nconvention to respect the possessions of others. This redirection of\nself-interest, aided by our natural tendency to sympathize with the\nfeelings of others who benefit from stability of possession, gives\nrise to our approval of justice. In this way, Hume argues, the virtue\nof obeying laws arises naturally from our feelings and desires.\n\nHume\u2019s indebtedness to Greek ethics can be seen even more\nclearly in his discussion of the natural virtues. Of these, one\nimportant group (consisting of courage, magnanimity, ambition, and\nothers) is based on, or may even be a form of, self-esteem:\n\u201c[W]hatever we call heroic virtue, and admire under the\ncharacter of greatness and elevation of mind, is either nothing but a\nsteady and well-established pride and self-esteem, or partakes largely\nof that passion. Courage \u2026 and all the other shining virtues of\nthat kind, have plainly a strong mixture of self-esteem in them, and\nderive a great part of their merit from that origin\u201d (Hume,\nTreatise, 599\u2013600). Yet these virtues based on\nself-esteem must be tempered by a second group that includes\ngenerosity, compassion, fidelity, and friendship; otherwise traits\nlike courage are \u201cfit only to make a tyrant and public\nrobber\u201d (Hume, Treatise, 603). This second group of\nvirtues is based on broadly-based feelings of good will, affection,\nand concern for others.\n\nHume acknowledges that his second group of natural virtues owes a debt\nto the Stoic view that a virtuous person ought to be concerned with\nthe welfare of all human beings, whether they be intimate or stranger;\nand in describing the first group of natural virtues, Hume looks to\nSocrates as someone who has achieved a kind of inner calm and\nself-esteem. In addition, his general approach to the natural virtues,\nthat some are based on self-esteem and others on friendly feelings and\ngood will, is reminiscent of Aristotle\u2019s exploration of the\npsychological foundations of virtue.\n\nHume believes that we develop self-esteem from what we do well, if\nwhat we do well expresses something distinctive and durable about us,\nand he seems to recognize that realized deliberative abilities are\namong the most durable features of ourselves. As we gain a facility at\ndeliberation, we come to develop self-esteem and enjoy who we are,\nlike Aristotle\u2019s virtuous person who enjoys most the exercise of\nhis developed deliberative powers. Moreover, Hume\u2019s recognition\nthat self-esteem must be tempered by benevolence is reflected in\nAristotle\u2019s argument that the development and preservation of\nproper self-love requires friendships in which persons come to care\nfor others for others\u2019 own sakes.\n\nIn addition to exploring these psychological foundations of virtue,\nHume seems to accord them a role that is reminiscent of the\nAristotelian view that virtue is a state in which reason and passion\nspeak with the same voice. Instead of making virtue and good character\nsubordinate to the requirements of reason, as we saw in the natural\nlaw theorists and in Kant, Hume appears to give virtue and good\ncharacter room to guide and constrain the deliberations of agents so\nas to affect what they determine to be best to do. By doing so, Hume\ngoes some way toward indicating how good character is different from\ncontinence.\n\nHume\u2019s account of how we determine what is right and wrong\nilluminates the role character plays. When Hume\u2019s\n\u201cjudicious spectator\u201d determines what is right and wrong,\nshe fixes on some \u201csteady and general\u201d point of view and\n\u201cloosens\u201d herself from her actual feelings and interests.\nIt appears that someone who has developed an enjoyment in the\nactivities of deliberating and reflecting, and whose self-esteem is\nbased on that enjoyment, will be more likely to take up the point of\nview of the judicious spectator and to perform the subtle corrections\nin response that may be necessary to loosen oneself from one\u2019s\nown perspective and specific passions. Someone whose self-esteem is\nbased on an enjoyment taken in deliberation will be attuned to wider\ncomplications and will have the wider imaginative powers needed for\ncorrect deliberation from a steady and general point of view.\nHume\u2019s view of the relation between passion and deliberation is\nreminiscent of the Aristotelian view that someone with proper\nself-love will also be practically wise, in that his self-love will\nenable him to size up practical situations correctly and determine\ncorrectly what it is best to do.\n\nFor more detailed discussion of Hume\u2019s view of the virtues, see\nBaier (1991). On Hume\u2019s indebtedness to Greek ethics, see Homiak\n(2000). \n3.4 Marx and Mill\n\nAnother illustration of the use of Greek views of character can be\nfound in the writings of Karl Marx (1818\u20131883) and John Stuart\nMill (1806\u20131873). Although Marx is best known for his virulent\ncriticism of capitalism and Mill for his exposition and defense of\nliberal utilitarianism, these philosophers are treated together here\nbecause their approach to character is at crucial points deeply\nAristotelian. Both Marx and Mill accept Aristotle\u2019s insight that\nvirtue and good character are based on a self-esteem and\nself-confidence that arises from a satisfaction taken in the fully\nrealized expression of the rational powers characteristic of human\nbeings. They also accept Aristotle\u2019s recognition that the\nproduction and preservation of this type of self-esteem require that\nindividuals be part of specific socio-political structures. Aristotle\nemphasized the need for a special type of political community. Marx\nattended to smaller democratic workplaces. Mill\u2019s focus, still\ndifferent, was on political equality and equality in the family. \n\nMarx\u2019s early Economic and Philosophic Manuscripts of\n1844 is famous for the discussion of how the organization of work\nunder capitalism alienates workers and encourages them to accept the\nvalues of capitalist society. Workers who are committed to capitalist\nvalues are characterized primarily by self-interested attitudes. They\nare most interested in material advancement for themselves, they are\ndistrustful of others\u2019 seemingly good intentions, and they view\nothers primarily as competitors for scarce positions. Given these\nattitudes, they are prone to a number of vices, including cowardice,\nintemperance, and lack of generosity.\n\nMarx\u2019s discussion of alienated labor suggests how work can be\nre-organized to eliminate alienation, undermine commitment to\ntraditional capitalist values and goals, and produce attitudes more\ncharacteristic of Aristotle\u2019s virtuous person. The key to this\ntransformation lies in re-organizing the nature of work so that\nworkers can express what Marx calls their \u201cspecies-being\u201d\nor those features of the self that are characteristically human. Very\nmuch like Aristotle, Marx seems to mean by this an individual\u2019s\nability to reason, and in particular his powers of choosing, deciding,\ndiscriminating, and judging. If work is re-organized to enable workers\nto express their rational powers, then each worker will perform tasks\nthat are interesting and mentally challenging (no worker will perform\nstrictly monotonous, routine, unskilled tasks). In addition, workers\nwill participate in deliberations about the ends to be achieved by the\nwork they do and how to achieve those ends. And, finally, these\ndeliberations will be organized democratically so that the opinions of\neach worker are fairly taken into account. When these conditions are\nput into place, labor is no longer \u201cdivided\u201d between\nskilled and unskilled or between managerial and non-managerial. Marx\nsuggests that if work is reorganized in these ways, it will promote\nfeelings of solidarity and camaraderie among workers and eventually\nbetween these workers and those in similar situations elsewhere. For\nthe fact that workers can express their characteristic human powers in\naction, coupled with the egalitarian conditions in the workplace, can\nupset competitive feelings and promote respect by removing the bases\nfor inferiority and superiority. Workers then come to exhibit some of\nthe more traditional virtues such as generosity and trustfulness, and\navoid some of the more traditional vices such as cowardice,\nstinginess, and self-indulgence.\n\nThat Marx\u2019s views seem derivative of Aristotle\u2019s in\nimportant ways is not surprising, for, unlike Hume whose knowledge of\nAristotle is not fully known, Marx explicitly drew upon\nAristotle\u2019s works. For further discussion of the extent to which\nMarx drew on Aristotle, see DeGolyer (1985).\n\nJohn Stuart Mill (1806\u20131873) defended a version of liberal\nutilitarianism, but scholars disagree about what kind of\nutilitarianism that was. We can safely say that, as a utilitarian,\nMill thought human conduct should promote the happiness or welfare of\nthose affected. But was Mill an act-utilitarian, who thought that\nright acts are those that promote as much happiness as can be done on\nthe particular occasion, given the alternatives available to the\nagent? Or was he a rule-utilitarian, who thought that right conduct\nwas conduct permitted by rules that, when publicly known to be\ngenerally accepted or followed, would maximize happiness or welfare?\nOr was he a motive-utilitarian, who thought that one should act as the\nperson with the motives or virtues most productive of happiness should\nact? (For a discussion of these interpretive questions, see the\nrelated entry on\n Mill\u2019s moral and political philosophy.)\n Although this entry will steer clear of these interpretive hurdles\nand will concentrate on Mill\u2019s discussion of the nature of\nhappiness and of some of the institutional structures that can promote\nhappiness, these questions of interpretation will be relevant to a\nfinal assessment of Mill in Section 4, below.\n\nIn his essay On Liberty Mill claims that his version of\nutilitarianism rests on a conception of happiness that is appropriate\nto people as \u201cprogressive\u201d beings (Mill 1975, 12). And in\nUtilitarianism he suggests that this conception is focused on\nthe \u201chigher pleasures\u201d that serve to distinguish humans\nfrom animals (Mill 1979, 7\u201311). These higher pleasures turn out\nto be the activities and pursuits that exercise what in\nAristotle\u2019s view are our powers of practical deliberation\n\u2013 of choosing, judging, deciding, and discriminating. In On\nLiberty, Mill writes: \u201cHe who lets the world \u2026\nchoose his plan of life for him has no need of any other faculty than\nthe ape-like one of imitation. He who chooses his plan for himself\nemploys all his faculties. He must use observation to see, reasoning\nand judgment to foresee, activity to gather materials for decision,\ndiscrimination to decide, and when he has decided, firmness and\nself-control to hold his deliberate decision\u201d (Mill 1975, 56).\nAs a person develops his powers of practical deliberation and comes to\nenjoy their exercise, he gains the self-esteem that is the basis of a\nvirtuous and well-lived life.\n\nFor further discussion of Mill\u2019s view of happiness, see Brink\n(1992).\n\nMill argued that seriously unequal societies, by preventing\nindividuals from developing their deliberative powers, mold\nindividuals\u2019 character in unhealthy ways and impede their\nability to live virtuous lives. For example, Mill argued, in deep\ndisagreement with the views of his own time, that societies that have\nsystematically subordinated women have harmed both men and women,\nmaking it almost impossible for men and women to form relationships of\ngenuine intimacy and understanding. In The Subjection of\nWomen, Mill wrote that the family, as constituted at his time,\nwas a \u201cschool of despotism,\u201d which taught those who\nbenefited from it the vices of selfishness, self-indulgence, and\ninjustice. Among working class men, the fact that wives were\nexcessively dependent on their husbands inspired meanness and\nsavagery. In chapter IV of The Subjection of Women, Mill goes\nso far as to claim that \u201c[a]ll the selfish propensities, the\nself-worship, the unjust self-preference, which exist among mankind,\nhave their source and root in, and derive their principal nourishment\nfrom, the present constitution of the relation between men and\nwomen\u201d (Mill 1988, 86). Women who have been legally and socially\nsubordinated to men become meek, submissive, self-sacrificing, and\nmanipulative. In brief, men evidence the vices of the slave master,\nwhile women evidence the vices of the slave. For moral lives and\npsychologically healthy relationships to be possible, Mill called for\naltered marital arrangements, supported by changes in law, that would\npromote the development and exercise of women\u2019s deliberative\npowers along with men\u2019s. Only under such conditions could women\nand men acquire feelings of real self-esteem rather than feelings of\nfalse inferiority and superiority.\n\nLike Aristotle, Mill recognized the power of political institutions to\ntransform individuals\u2019 desires and aims and to improve them\nmorally. In chapter III of Considerations on Representative\nGovernment, Mill writes approvingly of the democratic\ninstitutions of ancient Athens. He believed that by participating in\nthese institutions, Athenians were called upon to rise above their\nindividual partialities and to consider the general good. By\nco-operating with others in governing their community, he wrote, each\ncitizen \u201cis made to feel himself one of the public, and whatever\nis their interest to be his interest\u201d (Mill 1991, 79).\n\nAnd like Marx, Mill recognized the morally disturbing effects of a\nlife limited to routine and unskilled labor. In Principles of\nPolitical Economy, he recommended that relations of economic\ndependence between capitalists and workers be eliminated in favor of\ncooperatives either of workers with capitalists or of workers alone.\nIn these associations members were to be roughly equal owners of\ntools, raw materials, and capital. They worked as skilled\ncraftspersons under self-imposed rules. They elected and removed their\nown managers. By elevating the dignity of labor, Mill thought such\ncooperatives could convert \u201ceach human being\u2019s daily\noccupation into a school of the social sympathies and the practical\nintelligence\u201d and bring people as close to social justice as\ncould be imagined (Mill 1900, vol. 2, 295).\n3.5 T. H. Green\n\nT. H. Green (1836\u20131882) began as a student and teacher of\nclassics before turning to philosophy. He knew Plato\u2019s and\nAristotle\u2019s Greek texts well. In developing his view of a\nperson\u2019s good in Book III of his Prolegomena to Ethics,\nGreen finds his own views anticipated in Plato and Aristotle and\nespecially in Aristotle\u2019s treatment of happiness, the human\ngood, and the particular virtues. Green aims to show that a\nperson\u2019s good consists in his \u201cself-satisfaction\u201d or\n\u201cself-realization.\u201d To realize the self requires that one\nfully develop his capacities as a rational agent. And that requires\naiming at the good of others for their own sake. Green thought\nAristotle was right about the nature of the virtuous person\u2019s\nmotive. In Prolegomena 263 he notes Aristotle\u2019s view\nthat the virtuous person acts tou kalou heneka (for the sake\nof the fine), and he recognizes that acting in this way requires that\nthe agent have concern for the good of the community. So the\nagent\u2019s good is connected to the good of others. \n\nTo illustrate his reading of Aristotle, Green discusses two of\nAristotle\u2019s virtues: courage and temperance. He notes that both\nvirtues appear to be more restricted in scope than commonsense would\nsuggest. In discussing courage, Aristotle limits courage to facing\nfear in danger of death in defense of one\u2019s city\n(Nicomachean Ethics 1115a25\u201329). A man who faces death\nby drowning or disease is not courageous. Courage is restricted to\nfacing death in battle for one\u2019s city because such action aims\nat the common good and is the finest form of death. Green uses these\npoints in Aristotle\u2019s discussion to show that Aristotle\u2019s\nview rests on a general principle that can widen the circumstances of\ncourage in a way that Green accepts. In Green\u2019s view, courage is\na matter of facing the danger of death \u201cin the service of the\nhighest public cause which the agent can conceive\u201d (1969, 260).\n\n\nGreen explains Aristotle\u2019s restrictions on temperance in a\nsimilar way. Not every form of restraint counts as temperance for\nAristotle. It is limited to restraint of the pleasures of appetitive\ndesires for food, drink, and sex, the pleasures we share with\nnon-human animals. The intemperate person is like the gourmand who\nprayed that his throat might become longer than a crane\u2019s: he is\ninterested in sensation and does not value the exercise of his\nrational capacities. Green recognizes that Aristotle needs to check\nthese appetitive desires because intemperance is a danger to the\ncommon good. He writes: \u201csuch a check should be kept on the\nlusts of the flesh as might prevent them from issuing in what a Greek\nknew as hubris \u2013 a kind of self-assertion and\naggression upon the rights of others \u2026 which was looked upon as\nthe antithesis of the civil spirit\u201d (1969, 263). \n\nGreen was right to find his views anticipated in the Greeks. He saw,\nas Aristotle did, that living well requires the exercise of\none\u2019s developed rational powers, and that persons who have\nrealized their powers and have formed virtuous traits of character aim\nat the common good, which is a part of their own good. Like Aristotle,\nGreen thought that such development required that one be a participant\nin a special kind of political community \u2013 one \u201cwhere the\nfree combination of mutually respecting citizens\u201d enact equal\nlaw and the common good (1969, 263). \n\nFor further discussion of Green\u2019s interpretation and use of\nAristotle\u2019s views, see Irwin (2009).\n3.6 Rawls\n\nAs indicated in the introduction to this entry, a renewed\nphilosophical interest in questions of virtue and character was\nindirectly the result of the publication in 1971 of John Rawls\u2019s\nA Theory of Justice. In contrast to many of his\ncontemporaries who focused on meta-ethical questions and the meaning\nof moral terms, Rawls (1921\u20132002) moved moral and political\nphilosophy in a practical direction and stimulated modern philosophers\nto explore the psychological grounding of good moral character. Early\nin Part II of A Theory of Justice, Rawls makes what he calls\na \u201cperfectly obvious\u201d point \u2013 that the social system\nshapes the wants and aspirations that its citizens come to have. It\ndetermines \u201cin part the sort of persons they want to be as well\nas the sort of persons they are\u201d (1999a, 229). These points,\nRawls claims, have always been recognized. \n\nHow do just institutions shape our wants and aims and affect the sort\nof people we become? The institutions of interest to Rawls are those\nthat make up a society\u2019s \u201cbasic structure\u201d. These\nare the institutions that make social cooperation possible and\nproductive. They include the political constitution, the structure of\nthe economy, legalized forms of property ownership, the family in some\nform, and others. Rawls defends two principles of justice as\nregulations for the basic structure of his just society: (1) the equal\nliberties principle, according to which each person has the same claim\nto a fully adequate scheme of basic liberties. (2) and a second\nprinciple that specifies two conditions that must be satisfied in\norder for socio-economic inequalities to be permissible. These\nconditions are fair equality of opportunity and the difference\nprinciple.\n\nConsider Rawls\u2019s discussion of the guarantee of equal liberties\nunder the first principle of justice. This principle covers two types\nof liberties, personal liberties and political liberties. Under this\nprinciple, each person is entitled to liberties of both kinds as a\nbasic right. But Rawls goes further to argue that political liberties\nmust be assured their \u201cfair value\u201d (1999a, 243). This\nmeans that chances to hold office and to exercise political influence\nmust be independent of socio-economic position. Otherwise,\n\u201cpolitical power rapidly accumulates and becomes unequal\u201d\n(1999a, 199). To preserve fair value, Rawls does not follow\nAristotle\u2019s strategy of making political participation a\nrequirement of all citizens. Yet he shares with Aristotle the view\nthat the guarantee of fair value has the aim of promoting and\nsustaining citizens\u2019 common status as equal citizens (1999a,\n205\u2013206). Moreover, Rawls agrees with Mill that political\nparticipation contributes to the moral development of citizens. As\nnoted in Section 3.4 above, when praising Athenian democracy, Mill\nwrites that when a citizen participates in public deliberation,\n\u201che is called upon \u2026 to weigh interests not his own, to\nbe guided, in case of conflicting claims by another rule than his\nprivate partialities; to apply at every turn principles and maxims\nwhich have for their reason of existence the general good \u2026 .\nHe is made to feel himself one of the public, and whatever is their\ninterest to be his interest\u201d (1991, 79). The guarantee of\npolitical liberty both strengthens citizens\u2019 sense of their own\nvalue and enlarges their moral sensibilities.\n\nIn part III, Rawls turns to the question of how individuals acquire a\ndesire to act justly, and to do so for the right reasons, when they\nhave lived under and benefited from just institutions (1999a, 399).\nRawls\u2019s account is indebted to Aristotle\u2019s views in\nseveral ways. First, Rawls holds, as Aristotle did, that if proper\ninstitutions are in place, then the attitudes and behaviors associated\nwith the desire to act justly will emerge naturally, as a result of\npsychological tendencies persons experience in ordinary life. For,\nother things being equal, it is part of human psychology to enjoy most\nthe exercise of one\u2019s realized powers (see Rawls\u2019s\ndiscussion of what he calls the Aristotelian Principle), to enjoy the\nrealization of others\u2019 powers (see his discussion of the\n\u201ccompanion effect\u201d to the Aristotelian principle), and to\nform ties of attachment and friendship to persons and institutions who\npromote one\u2019s good. Second, and again like Aristotle, Rawls\nargues that if citizens are fortunate to live in a community that\nprovides the basic goods they need for realizing their powers and that\noffers them opportunities to develop and use their abilities in shared\nactivities with others, then they will develop a stable sense of their\nown value that is based on their own accomplishments and their status\nas equal citizens, rather than on a position more advantaged relative\nto others. With a stable sense of their own value and a reasonable\nhope of achieving their aims, citizens will want to act justly for the\nright reasons. They will not be prone to rancor, jealousy, and hostile\nenvy, \u201cone of the vices of hating mankind\u201d (1999a,\n466).\n\nOnly a brief discussion of these points of coincidence is possible\nhere. Consider, first, sections 72\u201375 of A Theory of\nJustice, where Rawls outlines what he calls the three stages of\nmoral development, governed by three psychological laws. These laws\nexplain how individuals come to have new, non-derivative, final ends\nas they acquire ties of love, friendship, affection, and trust. As\nAristotle recognized, these ties are caused to occur in individuals as\nthey come to recognize others\u2019 evident intention to act for\ntheir good, and to enjoy what they and others can do.\n\nAt the first stage of moral development, on the assumption that family\ninstitutions are just, children come to love their parents as a result\nof their parents\u2019 demonstrating clearly that their children are\nenjoyed and valued. At the second stage, on the assumption that\ncooperative associations are fairly arranged and known to be so,\nmembers of reasonably successful cooperative associations\n(Rawls\u2019s \u201csocial unions\u201d) come to enjoy and value\ntheir cooperative partners. This happens when members do their parts\nresponsibly, each contributing to a mutually recognized goal, and\nwhere all participants display appropriate abilities. Under these\nconditions, participants come to enjoy their own participation, to\nenjoy the display of others\u2019 skills and abilities, and to form\nties of friendship and trust with their cooperative partners. Because\nthe activities are complementary, individuals can see themselves in\nwhat others do. In this way, individuals\u2019 sense of what they are\ndoing is worthwhile. Their self-love, to use Aristotelian language,\nbecomes a group achievement.\n\nFinally, at the third stage, as individuals come to realize how the\ninstitutions regulated by the principles of justice promote their good\nand the good of their fellow citizens, they become attached to these\nprinciples and develop a desire to apply and to act in accordance with\nthem. Like the major institutions of Aristotle\u2019s ideal\npolis, the institutions regulated by Rawls\u2019s two\nprinciples of justice have as their aim to promote citizens\u2019\ngood by providing the social bases of individuals\u2019 self-worth\n(Rawls\u2019s primary good of \u201cself-respect\u201d). The\nprovision of equal liberties in accordance with the first principle of\njustice enables citizens to form the associations in which their\ncommon aims and ideals can be pursued. As we have seen, these\nassociations are necessary for self-respect to be produced and\nmaintained. The guarantee of the fair value of political liberty,\nalong with fair equality of opportunity under Rawls\u2019s second\nprinciple of justice, prevent excessive accumulation of property and\nwealth and maintain equal opportunity of education for all, enabling\neveryone with similar motivation and ability to have roughly equal\nprospects of culture and achievement (1999a, 63). Taken together,\nthese two principles ensure that persons have reasonable hopes of\nachieving their aims. Finally, the difference principle serves to\nensure everyone a decent standard of living, no matter what individual\ncitizens\u2019 social position, natural talents, or fortune may be.\nThe difference principle, Rawls writes, corresponds to the \u201cidea\nof not wanting to have greater advantages unless this is to the\nbenefit of others who are less well off\u201d (1999a, 90). In these\nvarious ways, the two principles, in combination, amount to a publicly\nacknowledged recognition that each citizen has equal worth.\n\nOnce these just institutions are in place, Rawls thinks that the worst\naspects of the social division of labor can be overcome. No one, he\nwrites, \u201cneed be servilely dependent on others and made to\nchoose between monotonous and routine occupations which are deadening\nto human thought and sensibility\u201d (1999a, 464). Here Rawls notes\nthe same problems with many types of paid labor that so disturbed\nAristotle. Paid labor often limits the worker\u2019s exercise of her\ndecision-making powers and requires her to conform to the direction of\nothers. Of course, Rawls does not suggest solving these problems as\nAristotle did. But he thinks that they need to be solved, and that a\njust society can solve them, perhaps by adopting Mill\u2019s proposal\n(see Section 3.4 above) to restructure workplaces to become\nworker-managed cooperatives (2001, 178).\n\nFor further discussion of Rawls\u2019s views on how institutions\nshape our characters, see Freeman (2007, ch. 6) and Edmundson (2017,\nch. 3).\n4. Contemporary Questions About Character\n\nMarx, Mill, and Rawls suggest how character can be molded by\nantecedent circumstances \u2013 Marx by economic structures; Mill by\npaid work, political life, and family relationships; Rawls by the\ninstitutions regulated by the two principles of justice. Yet these\ninsights about the effect of institutions on character seem to raise\nother, more troubling questions: if our character is the result of\nsocial and political institutions beyond our control, then perhaps we\nare not in control of our characters at all and becoming decent is not\na real possibility. \n\nAmong contemporary philosophers, Susan Wolf is one of several who\naddress these worries. In her Freedom Within Reason Wolf\nargues that almost any morally problematic upbringing could be\ncoercive and could render a person unable to see what he ought morally\nto do or render him unable to act on that recognition. As examples,\nWolf cites ordinary citizens of Nazi Germany, white children of slave\nowners in the 1850s, and persons brought up to embrace conventional\nsex roles. Wolf thinks that there is no method for determining which\nupbringings and influences are consistent with an ability to see what\nshould be done and to act accordingly, and hence she thinks there is\nalways the risk that we are less responsible for our actions than we\nmay hope. \n\nSuch skepticism may be misplaced. For if good character is based on\nnaturally occurring psychological responses that most people\n(including persons brought up to embrace racist and sexist beliefs)\nexperience without difficulty, then most people should be able to\nbecome better and to be responsible for actions that express (or could\nexpress) their character. \n\nStill, this is not to say that changing one\u2019s character is easy,\nstraightforward, or quickly achieved. If character is formed or\nmalformed by the structures of political, economic, and family life,\nthen changing one\u2019s character may require access to the\nappropriate transforming forces, which may not be available. In modern\nsocieties, for example, many adults still work at alienating jobs that\ndo not afford opportunity to realize the human powers and to\nexperience the pleasures of self-expression. Women in particular,\nbecause of unequal domestic arrangements, nearly total responsibility\nfor childcare, and sex segregation in the workplace, often endure\nlow-paying, dead-end jobs that encourage feelings of self-hatred. In a\nfamily where economic, and hence psychological, power is unequal\nbetween women and men, affection, as Mill recognized, may harm both\nparties. Thus many women and men today may not be well-positioned to\ndevelop fully the psychological capacities Aristotle, Marx, Mill, and\nRawls considered foundational to virtuous character.\n\nThese considerations indicate why character has become a central issue\nnot only in ethics, but also in feminist philosophy, political\nphilosophy, philosophy of education, and philosophy of literature. If\ndeveloping good moral character requires being members of a community\nin which citizens can fully realize their human powers and ties of\nfriendship, then one needs to ask how educational, economic,\npolitical, and social institutions should be structured to make that\ndevelopment possible. Some contemporary philosophers are now\naddressing these issues. For example, Martha Nussbaum uses\nAristotelian virtues to outline a democratic ideal in (1990b). In\n(1996) Andrew Mason explores how capitalist market forces make it\ndifficult for virtues to flourish. In (1987) Jon Elster interprets\nMarx as offering a conception of the good life that consists in active\nself-realization, which can be promoted or blocked by economic and\npolitical institutions. In (1993) John Bernard Murphy reconstructs\nAristotle\u2019s views on practical deliberation and decision-making\nto show how they can yield a theory of productive labor that helps us\nsee what is wrong with work in the contemporary world and how to\nre-organize it. Rosalind Hursthouse applies an Aristotelian view of\nthe emotions to an investigation of racist attitudes in (2001). In\n(2010) Marcia Homiak develops Aristotle\u2019s and Mill\u2019s views\non the transformative power of institutions to explore the\npossibilities for living virtuously in an imperfect world. Laurence\nThomas (1989) uses Aristotle\u2019s discussions of self-love and\nfriendship to argue that friendship helps to develop and maintain good\nmoral character. And if one is interested in understanding what the\nnature of moral character is and the extent to which it can be\naltered, one will find useful examples of both good and bad moral\ncharacter in literary writers. For philosophical discussion of\nliterary writers\u2019 use of character, see Taylor (1996) and\nNussbaum (1990a).\n\nFinally, it might be useful to note that this brief discussion of the\nhistory of philosophical views of character indicates that character\nhas played, or can play, an important role in a variety of western\nethical traditions, from Greek virtue-centered views to Kantianism to\nutilitarianism to Marxism. So Anscombe\u2019s provocative claim with\nwhich this entry began \u2013 that the two major traditions in modern\nmoral theory (Kantianism and utilitarianism) have ignored questions of\nvirtue and character to their detriment \u2013 does not seem\naltogether true. Nevertheless, some of the views surveyed here seem to\ngive a more prominent role to character and virtue than do others. It\nis not easy to explain precisely what this prominence consists in.\nAlthough a full treatment of these issues is beyond the scope of this\nessay, a preliminary indication of how they might be addressed can be\nprovided. For further discussion of these questions, see Trianosky\n(1990), Watson (1990), Homiak (1997), and Hursthouse (2001).\n\nAs this entry has indicated, Kant\u2019s views do provide a role for\nvirtue, for it matters to Kant that we perform our imperfect duties\nwith the right spirit. The virtuous person has the properly cultivated\ntendencies to feel that make it easier for her to perform her\nimperfect duties. These feelings support her recognition of what is\nright and are a sign that she is disposed to perform her duties.\nBecause Kant views the emotions as recalcitrant and in continual need\nof reason\u2019s control, virtue amounts to a kind of self-mastery or\ncontinence. One might put this point by saying that, for Kant,\nvirtuous character is subordinate to the claims of practical\nreason.\n\nAristotle\u2019s view, on the other hand, is usually considered a\nparadigm example of a \u201cvirtue ethics\u201d, an ethical theory\nthat gives priority to virtuous character. To see what this might\nmean, recall that Aristotle\u2019s virtuous person is a genuine\nself-lover who enjoys most the exercise of her abilities to think and\nknow. This enjoyment guides her practical determinations of what\nactions are appropriate in what circumstances and renders her\nunattracted to the pleasures associated with the common vices. Her\nproperly cultivated emotional tendencies are not viewed as\nrecalcitrant aspects of her being that need to be controlled by\nreason. Rather, her practical decisions are informed and guided by the\nenjoyment she takes in her rational powers. One might put this point\nby saying that, in Aristotle\u2019s view, practical deliberation is\nsubordinate to character.\n\nOne might then ask of other ethical views whether they take practical\ndeliberation to be subordinate to character or vice versa. As this\nentry has indicated, Hume appears to side with Aristotle and to give\ncharacter priority over practical deliberation. For he suggests that\nsomeone with the natural virtues based on self-esteem will have the\nwider imaginative powers needed for correct deliberation from the\nstandpoint of the judicious spectator. Whether character is\nsubordinate to reason for Mill may depend on what sort of\nutilitarianism Mill can be shown to espouse. If he is a\nmotive-utilitarian who thinks that one should act as the person with\nthe motives or virtues most productive of happiness would act, then a\ncase could be made for his giving character priority over practical\nreason. If, on the other hand, he is an act- or rule-utilitarian, he\nwould seem to give character a role that is subordinate to reason.\nThese brief remarks indicate that the question of whether an ethical\ntheorist gives priority to character can only be determined by a\nthorough analysis of the various critical elements of that\nphilosopher\u2019s view.\n5. Moral Character and Empirical Studies\n5.1 The challenge posed by situationism\n\nThis section will begin with a brief discussion of some recent\nphilosophical work on character that relies on results in experimental\nsocial psychology. This philosophical work calls into question the\nconceptions of character and virtue that are of concern especially to\nthe ancient Greek moralists and to contemporary philosophers whose\nwork derives from ancient views. Philosophers impressed by this\ntradition in experimental social psychology \u2013 which is often\nlabeled \u201csituationism\u201d\u2013 have denied that traits of\ncharacter are stable, consistent, or evaluatively integrated in the\nway that ancient or contemporary philosophers suggest. The ancient\nmoralists assumed that virtues are, in John Doris\u2019s description,\n\u201crobust traits: if a person has a robust trait, they\ncan be confidently expected to display trait-relevant behavior across\na wide variety of trait-relevant situations, even where some or all of\nthese situations are not optimally conducive to such behavior\u201d\n(2002, 18). Doris and others argue that traits are not robust in this\nsense. They are not stable or consistent and are wrongly invoked to\nexplain why people act as they do. Rather, these philosophers argue,\nand as the experimental tradition indicates, much of human behavior is\nattributable to seemingly trivial features of the situations in which\npersons find themselves. Hence the appropriateness of the label\n\u201csituationist\u201d for the philosophers espousing these views.\nFor variations on this view, see Harman (1999, 2000), Doris (2002),\nand Vranas (2005). \n\nIt is beyond the scope of this entry to discuss this work in detail.\nSome summary remarks, however, are in order. (For a detailed\ndiscussion, see the entries on\n empirical approaches to moral character,\n section 1, and\n moral psychology: empirical approaches,\n section 4.)\n\nSkepticism about robust traits of character emerges from some famous\nexperiments in social psychology. For example, in one experiment\npersons who found a dime in a phone booth were far more likely to help\na confederate who dropped some papers than were those who did not find\na dime. Another experiment involved seminary students who agreed to\ngive a talk on the importance of helping those in need. On the way to\nthe building where their talks were to be given, they encountered a\nconfederate slumped over and groaning. Those who were told they were\nalready late were much less likely to help than those who were told\nthey had time to spare. These experiments are taken to show that minor\nfactors without moral significance (finding a dime, being in a hurry)\nare strongly correlated with people\u2019s helping behavior.\n\nPerhaps most damning for the robust view of character are the results\nof the experiments conducted by Stanley Milgram in the 1960s. In these\nexperiments the great majority of subjects, when politely though\nfirmly requested by an experimenter, were willing to administer what\nthey thought were increasingly severe electric shocks to a screaming\n\u201cvictim.\u201d These experiments are taken to show that if\nsubjects did have compassionate tendencies, these tendencies cannot\nhave been of the type that robust traits require.\n\nPhilosophers influenced by the experimental tradition in social\npsychology conclude that people do not have the broadly based, stable,\nconsistent traits of character that were of interest to the ancient\nand modern moralists, or to contemporary philosophers working with\nsome version of those views. Rather, the psychological studies are\ntaken to show that persons generally have only narrow,\n\u201clocal\u201d traits that are not unified with other traits into\na wider behavioral pattern. Persons are helpful when in a good mood,\nsay, but not helpful when in a hurry, or they are honest at home but\nnot honest at work. This skepticism about robust traits thus poses a\nchallenge to contemporary philosophers, especially those who work with\nsome version of the ancient views, to develop an account of character\nthat is consistent with empirical results.\n5.2 Some replies to situationism\n\nThese interpretations of the experiments in social psychology have\nbeen challenged by both psychologists and philosophers, especially by\nphilosophers working in the tradition of virtue ethics (see related\nentry on\n virtue ethics),\n who claim that the character traits criticized by situationists have\nlittle to do with the conception of character associated with the\nancient and modern moralists. The objectors say that the situationists\nrely on an understanding of character traits as isolated and often\nnon-reflective dispositions to behave in stereotypical ways. They\nwrongly assume that traits can be determined from a single type of\nbehavior stereotypically associated with that trait.\n\nConsider again the payphone and seminarian studies. It may seem\nobvious that one cannot respond to all appeals for help, and it may\nseem doubtful that any reflective person thinks one should. This\nsuggests that being a helpful person requires some thinking about what\nis most important in one\u2019s life, for calls of help can\njustifiably go unanswered if the individual believes that responding\nwill interfere with her doing something else that she takes to be of\nhigher moral importance. So we should not expect helping behavior to\nbe wholly consistent, given the complex situations in which persons\nfind themselves. Some of the philosophers discussed in this entry,\nsuch as the natural law theorists (in section 3.1) and Kant (in\nsection 3.2), might make this point by reminding us of the distinction\nbetween perfect and imperfect duties. Unlike perfect duties, which\nrequire that we take or forego certain actions, the duty to assist\nothers in need is imperfect, in that how, when, and whom we assist is\nnot precisely specifiable and so is within the individual\u2019s\ndiscretion. The general point, on which most of the ancient and modern\nmoralists would agree, is that being helpful cannot be understood in\nisolation from other values, aims, and traits that the individual has.\n(For discussion of how values can be unified, see Wolf 2007.)\n\nOr consider the Milgram experiments. During the experiments, many of\nthe subjects protested even while continuing to obey the\nexperimenter\u2019s commands. In post-experiment interviews with\nsubjects, Milgram noted that many were completely convinced of the\nwrongness of what they were doing. But the presence of conflict need\nnot indicate an absence, or loss, of character. On a traditional\nconception of character, as examined in this entry, many of\nMilgram\u2019s subjects are best described as incontinent. They have\ncharacter, but it is neither virtuous nor vicious. Many of us seem to\nfall into this category. We often recognize what it is right to do but\nwe nevertheless do not do it.\n\nIn short, the objectors say that the situationists rely on a\nsimplified view of character. They assume that behavior is often\nsufficient to indicate the presence of a trait of character, and they\nignore the other psychological aspects of character (both cognitive\nand affective) that, for most of the philosophers discussed in this\nentry, form a more or less consistent and integrated set of beliefs\nand desires. In particular, the objectors say, the situationists\nignore the role of practical deliberation (or, in the case of virtuous\ncharacter, practical wisdom).\n\nFor variations on these replies to the situationists, see Kupperman\n(2001), Kamtekar (2004), Radcliffe (2007), Sabini and Silver (2005),\nSreenivasan (2013), and cf. von Wright (1963,136\u2013154).\n5.3 Some empirical approaches to Aristotelian views of character\n\nSome recent philosophical work on character aims to meet the\nskepticism of the situationist challenge directly, by developing a\ntheory of virtue grounded in psychological studies that are compatible\nwith the existence of robust traits. This section provides a brief\nsummary of two such approaches to virtue.\n\nFor extensive and nuanced discussion, see Miller (2013, 2014) and\nSection 2 of the entry on\n empirical approaches to moral character,\n section 2. \n\nOne approach is inspired by the \u201ccognitive-affective personality\nsystem\u201d (the so-called CAPS model) that has been developed by\nsocial and cognitive psychologists. Rather than looking for empirical\nevidence of robust traits in behavioral regularities across different\ntypes of situations, the CAPS model (and philosophers impressed by\nthis model) focus on the importance of how agents understand the\nsituations they are in. The model views the structure of personality\nas the organization of relationships among \u201ccognitive-affective\nunits\u201d. These units are clusters of dispositions to feel,\ndesire, believe, and plan that, once activated, cause various\nthoughts, feelings, and behavior to be formed. Philosophers who ground\ntheir understanding of virtue in this type of psychological theory\nextend the CAPS model to cover robust virtuous traits of character.\nThese traits are viewed as enduring dispositions that include the\nappropriate clusters of thinking (practical reason), desire, and\nfeeling, manifested in cross-situational behavior.\n\nFor detailed discussion of the CAPS model and its possible value to\nphilosophers, see Miller (2003, 2014), Russell (2009) and Snow\n(2010).\n\nOther philosophers do not find the extension of the CAPS model\nespecially helpful, for it does not seem to move us past what we\ncommonsenically recognize as virtue. We are prepared to begin with the\nidea that being virtuous is not just being disposed to act, but also\nto feel, respond, and to reason. And not simply to reason, but to\nreason well. For this approach to be helpful, we need some account of\nwhat excellent practical reasoning consists in.\n\nSome philosophers aim to provide what is needed by looking to\npsychological studies of enjoyment. They propose that virtues are\nanalogous to (some) skills, in that the kind of habituation involved\nin developing and acting from virtuous character is like the sort of\nintelligent habituation typical of the development and exercise of\n(some) complex skills. The empirical studies of enjoyment show that,\nother things being equal, we enjoy the exercise of developed\nabilities, and the more complex the ability, the more we enjoy its\nexercise. If the acquisition and exercise of virtue is analogous to\nthe development and exercise of complex ability, we can, this approach\nsuggests, explain a variety of central points about virtuous activity\n\u2013 for example, that, like (some) skills, virtuous activity is\nexperienced as being its own end, as being enjoyable in itself, and\nthus as valued for its own sake. For discussion of virtue as similar\nto complex skill, see Annas (2011), Bloomfield (2014), Stichter (2007,\n2011), and cf. Sherman (1989).\n\nSituationists might nevertheless reply that to emphasize the role of\nexpertise in practical reasoning is to make good moral character an\nideal that too few of us, if any, can achieve. On some conceptions of\nmoral knowledge, such as that proposed by Plato in the\nRepublic, acquiring the knowledge necessary for virtue takes\nover 50 years of psychological and intellectual training. And on\nAristotle\u2019s view, as this entry has indicated in Section 2.4\nabove, the full realization of our rational powers that is required\nfor good moral character is not something that we can achieve on our\nown. The development and preservation of good moral character requires\npolitical institutions that promote the conditions under which\nself-love and friendship flourish. The situationist might wonder how\nuseful traditional conceptions of good character can be, if acquiring\nvirtuous character is a long and difficult process made possible by\nsocial institutions that do not yet exist. The situationist may take\nthese problems as support for his view that we are better off thinking\nin terms of local traits rather than robust traits.\n\nIn ending, it is appropriate to recall the discussion in Section 4,\nabove. On the one hand, on a view of character such as\nAristotle\u2019s, which relies on ordinary capacities to experience\nthe pleasures of self-expression and to respond with friendly feelings\nto others\u2019 efforts to help, almost everyone is capable of\nbecoming better. On the other hand, if Aristotle and others\n(such as Marx, Mill, T. H. Green, and Rawls) are correct that\ncharacter is shaped by the institutions of political, economic, and\nfamily life, then becoming good will require access to the\nappropriate institutions. Yet this is not to suggest that becoming\ngood is out of our reach. It may be helpful here to recall\nRawls\u2019s description of a \u201crealistic utopia\u201d in\nThe Law of Peoples when, following Rousseau in The Social\nContract, he writes that just institutions take \u201cmen as\nthey are\u201d and \u201claws as they might be.\u201d (Rawls,\n1999b, 7) Our psychological natures and the institutions that promote\ngood qualities of character are, in his view and in the views of\nothers discussed throughout this entry, congruent.\n", "bibliography": {"categories": ["<a name=\"PriLit\">Primary Literature</a>", "<a name=\"SecLit\">Secondary Literature</a>"], "cat_ref_text": {"<a name=\"PriLit\">Primary Literature</a>": ["</h3>\n<ul class=\"hanging\">", "Aristotle, <em>Nicomachean Ethics</em>, and <em>Politics</em>, in\n<em>The Complete Works of Aristotle</em>, J.
