Until the advent of automatic\ncomputing machines, this was the occupation of many thousands of\npeople in business, government, and research establishments. These\nhuman rote-workers were in fact called \u201ccomputers\u201d. Human\ncomputers used effective methods to carry out some aspects of the work\nnowadays done by electronic computers. The Church-Turing thesis is\nabout computation as this term was used in 1936, viz. human\ncomputation (to read more on this, turn to\n Section 7).\n\nFor instance, when Turing says that the operations of an L.C.M.\ninclude all those needed \u201cin the computation of a number\u201d,\nhe means \u201cin the computation of a number by a human\nbeing\u201d, since that is what computation was in those days.\nSimilarly, \u201cnumbers which would naturally be regarded as\ncomputable\u201d are numbers that would be regarded as being\ncomputable by a human computer, a human being who is working solely in\naccordance with an effective method.\n",
