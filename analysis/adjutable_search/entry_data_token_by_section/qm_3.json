    "main_text": "Quantum Mechanics\n3. Quantum Mechanics\n\n\nFour basic principles of quantum mechanics are: \n\n(3.1)\nPhysical States.\nEvery physical system is associated with a Hilbert Space, every unit\nvector in the space corresponds to a possible pure state of the system,\nand every possible pure state, to some vector in the\n space.[7]\n(3.2)\nPhysical Quantities.\nHermitian operators in the Hilbert space associated with a system\nrepresent physical quantities, and their eigenvalues represent the\npossible results of measurements of those quantities. \nThere is an operator, called the Hamiltonian, that plays a special\nrole in quantum theory because the dynamics of a system can be\nconveniently formulated by tracking its evolution. The Hamiltonian\n\u2013 written \\(H\\), or \\(\\hat{H}\\) \u2013 stands for the total\nenergy of the system. Its eigenvalues are the possible results that\nmight be obtained in measurements of total energy. It is given by\nsumming over the kinetic and potential energies of the system\u2019s\ncomponents.\n(3.3)\nComposition.\nThe Hilbert space associated with a complex system is the tensor\nproduct of those associated with the simple systems (in the standard,\nnon-relativistic, theory: the individual particles) of which it is\ncomposed. \n(3.4)\nDynamics.\n\na.\nContexts of type 1: Given the state of a system at\n\\(t\\) and the forces and constraints to which it is subject, there is\nan equation, \u2018Schr\u00f6dinger\u2019s\nequation\u2019, that gives the state at any other time \\(U\n\\ket{v_t} \\rightarrow \\ket{v_{t'}}\\).[8]\n The important properties of \\(U\\) for our\npurposes are that it is deterministic, which is to\nsay that it takes the state of a system at one time into a unique\nstate at any other, it is unitary, which means that\nit is an automorphism of the Hilbert space on which it acts (i.e., a\nmapping of that space onto itself that preserves the linear space\nstructure and inner product), and it is linear, which\nis to say that if it takes a state \\(\\ket{A}\\) onto the state\n\\(\\ket{A'}\\), and it takes the state \\(\\ket{B}\\) onto the state\n\\(\\ket{B'}\\), then it takes any state of the form \\(\\alpha \\ket{A} +\n\\beta \\ket{B}\\) onto the state \\(\\alpha \\ket{A'} + \\beta\n\\ket{B'}\\).\nb.\nContexts of type 2 (\u201cMeasurement\n Contexts\u201d):[9]\nCarrying out a \u201cmeasurement\u201d of an observable \\(B\\) on a\nsystem in a state \\(\\ket{A}\\) has the effect of collapsing the system\ninto a \\(B\\)-eigenstate corresponding to the eigenvalue observed. This\nis known as the Collapse\nPostulate. Which particular \\(B\\)-eigenstate it\ncollapses into is a matter of probability, and the probabilities are\ngiven by a rule known as Born\u2019s Rule:\n\n\\[\n\\Pr(b_i) = |\\braket{A}{B=b_i}|^2\n\\]  \n\n\n\nThere are two important points to note about these two kinds of\ncontexts:\n\nThe distinction between contexts of type 1 and 2 remains to be made\nout in quantum mechanical terms; nobody has managed to say in a\ncompletely satisfactory way, in the terms provided by the theory, which\ncontexts are measurement contexts, and\nEven if the distinction is made out, it is an open interpretive\nquestion whether there are contexts of type 2; i.e., it is an\nopen interpretive question whether there are any contexts in which\nsystems are governed by a dynamical rule other than\nSchr\u00f6dinger\u2019s equation.\n\n",
