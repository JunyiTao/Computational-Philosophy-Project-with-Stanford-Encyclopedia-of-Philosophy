    "main_text": "General Jurisprudence || The Normativity of Law\n1.2 The Normativity of Law\n\n\nThroughout human history the law has been known as a coercive\ninstitution, enforcing its practical demands on its subjects by means\nof threats and violence. This conspicuous feature of law made it very\ntempting for some philosophers to assume that the normativity of law\nresides in its coercive aspect. Even within the legal positivist\ntradition, however, the coercive aspect of the law has given rise to\nfierce controversies. Early legal positivists, such as Bentham and\nAustin, maintained that coercion is an essential feature of\nlaw, distinguishing it from other normative domains. Legal positivists\nin the 20th century have tended to deny this, claiming that coercion is\nneither essential to law, nor, actually, pivotal to the fulfillment of\nits functions in society. Before we unpack the various issues involved\nin this controversy, it might be worth noting that the debate about\nlaw\u2019s coercive aspect is one good example of debates in jurisprudence\nthat focus on what might be an essential or a necessary feature of law,\nregardless of its particular manifestations in this or that legal\nsystem. How to understand these claims about the essence of law, and\nthe question of whether these claims are about metaphysics or something\nelse, perhaps about morality, will be discussed in section 2.1.\n\n\nReturning to law\u2019s coercive aspect, there are several issues\nentangled here, and we should carefully separate them. John Austin\nfamously maintained that each and every legal norm, as such, must\ncomprise a threat backed by sanction. This involves at least two\nseparate claims: In one sense, it can be understood as a thesis about\nthe concept of law, maintaining that what we call \u201claw\u201d can\nonly be those norms which are backed by sanctions of the political\nsovereign. In a second, though not less problematic sense, the intimate\nconnection between the law and the threat of sanctions is a thesis\nabout the normativity of law. It is a reductionist thesis about law\u2019s\nnormative character, maintaining that the normativity of law consists\nin the subjects\u2019 ability to predict the chances of incurring punishment\nor evil and their presumed desire to avoid it.\n\n\nIn addition to this particular controversy, there is the further\nquestion, concerning the relative importance of sanctions for the\nability of law to fulfill its social functions. Hans Kelsen,\nfor instance, maintained that the monopolization of violence in\nsociety, and the law\u2019s ability to impose its demands by violent means,\nis the most important of law\u2019s functions in society. Twentieth century\nlegal positivists, like H.L.A. Hart and Joseph Raz, deny this,\nmaintaining that the coercive aspect of law is much more marginal than\ntheir predecessors assumed. Once again, the controversy here is\nactually twofold: is coercion essential to what the law does?\nAnd even if it is not deemed essential, how important it is, compared\nwith the other functions law fulfills in our lives?\n\n\nAustin\u2019s reductionist account of the normativity of law,\nmaintaining that the normative aspect of law simply consists in the\nsubjects\u2019 desire to avoid sanctions, was discussed extensively,\nand fiercely criticized, by H.L.A. Hart. Hart\u2019s fundamental\nobjection to Austin\u2019s reductionist account of law\u2019s\nnormativity is, on his own account, \u201cthat the predictive\ninterpretation obscures the fact that, where rules exist, deviations\nfrom them are not merely grounds for prediction that hostile reactions\nwill follow\u2026. but are also deemed to be a reason or\njustification for such reaction and for applying the sanctions\u201d\n(Hart 1961, 82). This emphasis on the reason-giving function of rules\nis surely correct, but perhaps not enough. Supporters of the\npredictive account could claim that it only begs the further question\nof why people should regard the rules of law as reasons or\njustifications for actions. If it is, for example, only\nbecause the law happens to be an efficient sanction-provider, then the\npredictive model of the normativity of law may turn out to be correct\nafter all. In other words, Hart\u2019s fundamental objection to the\npredictive model is actually a result of his vision about the main\nfunctions of law in society, holding, contra Austin and Kelsen, that\nthose functions are not exclusively related to the ability of the law\nto impose sanctions.\n\n\nIt is arguable, however, that law\u2019s functions in our culture are\nmore closely related to its coercive aspect than Hart seems to have\nassumed. Contemporary use of \u201cgame theory\u201d in the law tends\nto show that the rationale of a great variety of legal arrangements can\nbe best explained by the function of law in solving problems of\nopportunism, like the so called Prisoner\u2019s Dilemma situations. In these\ncases, the law\u2019s main role is, indeed, one of providing coercive\nincentives for the mutual benefit of all parties concerned. Be this as\nit may, we should probably refrain from endorsing Austin\u2019s or Kelsen\u2019s\nposition that law\u2019s only function in society is essentially tied to its\ncoercive aspects. Solving recurrent and multiple coordination problems,\nsetting standards for desirable behavior, proclaiming symbolic\nexpressions of communal values, resolving disputes about facts, and\nsuch, are important functions which the law serves in our society, and\nthose have very little to do with law\u2019s coercive aspect and its\nsanction-imposing functions.\n\n\nThe extent to which law can actually guide behavior by providing its\nsubjects with reasons for action has been questioned by a very\ninfluential group of legal scholars in the first half of the\n20th century, called the Legal Realism school. American\nLegal Realists claimed that our ability to predict the outcomes of\nlegal cases on the basis of the rules of law is rather limited. In the\nmore difficult cases which tend to be adjudicated in the appellate\ncourts, legal rules, by themselves, are radically indeterminate as to\nthe outcome of the cases. The Legal Realists thought that lawyers who\nare interested in the predictive question of what the courts will\nactually decide in difficult cases need to engage in sociological and\npsychological research, striving to develop theoretical tools that\nwould enable us to predict legal outcomes. Thus Legal Realism was\nmainly an attempt to introduce the social sciences into the domain of\njurisprudence for predictive purposes. To what extent this scientific\nproject succeeded is a matter of controversy. Be this as it may, Legal\nRealism paid very little attention to the question of the normativity\nof law, that is, to the question of how the law does guide behavior in\nthose cases in which it seems to be determinate enough.\n\n\nA much more promising approach to the normativity of law is found in\nJoseph Raz\u2019s theory of authority, which also shows how such a theory\nabout the normativity of law entails important conclusions with respect\nto the conditions of legal validity (Raz 1994). The basic insight of\nRaz\u2019s argument is that the law is an authoritative social institution.\nThe law, Raz claims, is a de facto authority. However, it is\nalso essential to law that it must be held to claim legitimate\nauthority. Any particular legal system may fail, of course, in its\nfulfillment of this claim. But law is the kind of institution which\nnecessarily claims to be a legitimate authority.\n\n\nAccording to Raz, the essential role of authorities in our practical\nreasoning is to mediate between the putative subjects of the authority\nand the right reasons which apply to them in the relevant\ncircumstances. An authority is legitimate if and only if it helps its\nputative subjects to comply better with the right reasons relevant to\ntheir actions\u2014i.e., if they are more likely to act in compliance\nwith these reasons by following the authoritative resolution than they\nwould be if they tried to figure out and act on the reasons directly\n(without the mediating resolution). For example, there may be many\nreasons that bear on the question of how fast to drive on a particular\nroad\u2014the amount of pedestrian traffic, impending turns in the\nroad, etc.\u2014but drivers may comply better with the balance of\nthose reasons by following the legal speed limit than if they tried to\nfigure out all the trade-offs in the moment. The legitimacy of the\nlegal speed limit would thus be derived from the way in which it aids\npeople in acting in better compliance with the balance of the right\nreasons.\n\n\nNow, it follows that for something to be able to claim legitimate\nauthority, it must be of the kind of thing capable of claiming\nit, namely, capable of fulfilling such a mediating role. What kinds of\nthings can claim legitimate authority? There are at least two such\nfeatures necessary for authority-capacity: First, for something to be\nable to claim legitimate authority, it must be the case that its\ndirectives are identifiable as authoritative directives,\nwithout the necessity of relying on those same reasons which the\nauthoritative directive replaces. If this condition is not met, namely,\nif it is impossible to identify the authoritative directive as such\nwithout relying on those same reasons the authority was meant to rely\non, then the authority could not fulfill its essential, mediating role.\nIn short, it could not make the practical difference it is there to\nmake. Note that this argument does not concern the efficacy of\nauthorities. The point is not that unless authoritative directives can\nbe recognized as such, authorities could not function effectively. The\nargument is based on the rationale of authorities within our practical\nreasoning. Authorities are there to make a practical difference, and\nthey could not make such a difference unless the authority\u2019s directive\ncan be recognized as such without recourse to the reasons it is there\nto decide upon. In other words, it is pointless to have an\nauthoritative directive if, in order to discover what the directive is,\nyou have to engage in the same reasoning that reliance on the directive\nis supposed to replace. Secondly, for something to be able to claim\nlegitimate authority, it must be capable of forming an opinion on how\nits subjects ought to behave, distinct from the subjects\u2019 own reasoning\nabout their reasons for action; authority requires some authorship.\n\n\nRaz\u2019s conception of legal authority provides very strong support for\nexclusive legal positivism because it requires that the law,\nqua an authoritative resolution, be identifiable on its own\nterms, that is, without having to rely on those same considerations\nthat the law is there to resolve. Therefore a norm is legally valid\n(i.e., authoritative) only if its validity does not derive from moral or\nother evaluative considerations that the law is intended to replace.\nNotably, Raz\u2019s theory challenges both Dworkin\u2019s anti-positivist legal\ntheory, and the inclusive version of legal positivism. This challenge,\nand the controversies it gave rise to, form one of the main topics\ndiscussed in contemporary general jurisprudence.\n\n\nExplaining the rationale of legal authority, however, is not the only\ncomponent of a theory about the normativity of law. If we hold the\nlegal positivist thesis that law is essentially founded on social\nconventions, another important question arises here: how can a\nconventional practice give rise to reasons for action and, in\nparticular, to obligations? Some legal philosophers claimed that\nconventional rules cannot, by themselves, give rise to obligations. As\nLeslie Green observed, Hart\u2019s \u201cview that the fundamental\nrules [of recognition] are \u2018mere conventions\u2019 continues to\nsit uneasily with any notion of obligation,\u201d and this Green\nfinds troubling, because the rules of recognition point to the\n\u201csources that judges are legally bound to apply\u201d\n(Green 1996, 1697). The debate here is partly about the conventional\nnature of the rules of recognition, and partly about the ways in which\nconventions can figure in our reasons for action. According to one\ninfluential theory, inspired by David Lewis (1969) conventional rules\nemerge as solutions to large-scale and recurrent coordination\nproblems. If the rules of recognition are, indeed, of such a\ncoordination kind, it is relatively easy to explain how they may give\nrise to obligations. Coordination conventions would be obligatory if\nthe norm subjects have an obligation to solve the coordination problem\nwhich initially gave rise to the emergence of the relevant\nconvention. It is doubtful, however, that the conventions at the\nfoundations of law are of a coordinative kind. In certain respects the\nlaw may be more like a structured game, or an artistic genre, which\nare actually constituted by social conventions. Such constitutive\nconventions are not explicable as solutions to some pre-existing\nrecurrent coordination problem. The conventional rules constituting\nthe game of chess, for example, are not there to solve a coordination\nproblem between potential players. Antecedent to the game of chess,\nthere was no particular coordination problem to solve. The\nconventional rules of chess constitute the game itself as a kind of\nsocial activity people would find worthwhile engaging in. The\nconstitutive conventions partly constitute the values inherent in the\nemergent social practice. Such values, however, are only there for\nthose who care to see them. Constitutive conventions, by themselves,\ncannot ground an obligation to engage in the practice they\nconstitute.\n\n\nFrom a moral point of view, the rules of recognition, by themselves,\ncannot be regarded as sources of obligation to follow the law. Whether\njudges, or anybody else, should or should not respect the rules of\nrecognition of a legal system, is ultimately a moral issue, that can\nonly be resolved by moral arguments (concerning the age old issue of\npolitical obligation). And this is more generally so: the existence of\na social practice, in itself, does not provide anyone with an\nobligation to engage in the practice. The rules of recognition only\ndefine what the practice is, and they can say nothing on the question\nof whether one should or should not engage in it. But of course, once\none does engage in the practice, playing the role of judge or some\nother legal official, as it were, there are legal obligations\ndefined by the rules of the game. In other words, there is nothing\nspecial in the idea of a legal obligation to follow the rules\nof recognition. The referee in a soccer game is equally obliged to\nfollow the rules of his game, and the fact that the game is\nconventional poses no difficulty from this, let us say,\n\u201cinternal-player\u2019s\u201d perspective. But again, the\nconstitutive rules of soccer cannot settle for anyone the question of\nwhether they should play soccer or not. Similarly, the rules of\nrecognition cannot settle for the judge, or anyone else for that\nmatter, whether they should play by the rules of law, or not. They only\ntell us what the law is. Unlike chess or soccer, however, the\nlaw may well be a kind of game that people have an obligation to play,\nas it were. But if there is such an obligation, it must emerge from\nexternal, moral, considerations, that is, from a general moral\nobligation to obey the law. The complex question of whether there is\nsuch a general obligation to obey the law, and whether it depends on\ncertain features of the relevant legal system, is extensively discussed\nin the literature on political obligation. A complete theory about the\nnormativity of law must encompass these moral issues as well. (See the\n entries on\n political obligation\n and\n legal obligation.)\n\nMore recently, however, a number of philosophers have started to\nquestion the idea that there is something unique to the normativity of\nlaw, inviting us to see how laws might affect our reasons for action\nin ways that are not closely tied to the nature of law (Greenberg\n2014, Enoch 2011, Marmor 2016 [2018]). Some of these views (e.g., Enoch,\nMarmor) purport to show that there are different ways in which the\nexistence of various norms bear on people\u2019s reasons for action,\npresent in law as elsewhere, without denying that the law often makes\na difference; these views only deny that there is something unique to\nthe way law changes its subjects\u2019 reasons for action, compared with\nother types normative demands. Others challenge law\u2019s normativity from\nan opposite angle (Greenberg 2014, Hershovitz 2015), arguing that the\nonly aspect of law that is of normative significance is the moral\ndifference that it makes to people\u2019s reasons for action.\n\n\nIn the last two decades of the 20th century, new challenges to general\njurisprudence, and particularly to legal positivism, have taken an\ninteresting methodological turn. This methodological turn gained\nmomentum with the publication of Dworkin\u2019s\nLaw\u2019s Empire (1986), arguing that not only the law, as a\nsocial practice, is a profoundly interpretative (and thus partly, but\nnecessarily, evaluative in nature), but that any theory about the\nnature of law is also interpretative in a similar way, and thus,\nequally evaluative. Many of those who do not necessarily share\nDworkin\u2019s views about the interpretative nature of legal practice, or\nthe specifics of his theory of interpretation, have joined him in this\nmethodological skepticism about the traditional aims of general\njurisprudence, that is, about the possibility of developing a theory\nabout that nature of law that would have general application and remain\nmorally neutral. These, and other resultant methodological challenges\nto traditional general jurisprudence are taken up in the next\nsection.\n\nIt would be fair to say, however, that in the last few years, many\nlegal philosophers have expressed a growing frustration with these\ntraditional debates about the nature of law, calling for legal\nphilosophy to move beyond the Hart-Dworkin debates and explore new\navenues of research. Some of these new critics are content to abandon\nthe project altogether, declaring the death of general jurisprudence\n(Hershovitz 2015). Others, however, are engaged in exploring new\nchallenges. One emerging area of research concerns the artifact nature\nof law, aiming to learn something about the nature of law from the\nfact that law seems to be an artifact, created and sustained by humans\nfor particular purposes. (See, for example, Burazin et al. eds., 2018.)\nOthers explore connections between law\u2019s features as artifact and\nfictionalism, suggesting that their underlying logic and metaphysics\nshare a great deal in common (Marmor 2018). Another new and\npotentially fruitful area of research focuses on applications of\nphilosophy of language to law, brining new developments in philosophy\nof language, particularly in pragmatics, to bear on questions of legal\ninterpretation and understanding of legal content (Asgeirsson\nforthcoming, Asgeirsson 2015, Marmor 2014). This linguistic direction\nis not uncontroversial, however; some legal philosophers express\nskepticism about the idea that legal content is determined by\nlinguistic factors (Greenberg 2011) and there is an ongoing debate\nabout these issues. Finally, there also seems to be a growing interest\nin recent developments in metaphysics that might bear on a theory\nabout the nature of law, and even debates about meta-metaphysics are\nbeginning to emerge in the context of general jurisprudence,\npurporting to show that ways in which we think about the tasks of\nmetaphysical inquiry may bear on ways we think about the law (Rosen\n2010). For example, if the main task of metaphysics is to determine\nwhat really exists in the world, irrespective of what we think about\nit or ways in which we represent the world, metaphysics may not have\nmuch to say about the nature of law or, perhaps, it may indicate that\nonly a scientific approach to jurisprudence can yield metaphysically\nrespectable results. If, however, the task of metaphysical inquiry is\nalso to figure out what is more foundational than something else,\ngiving us a hierarchical structure of the world, where some things\nground others, then metaphysics might be a very fruitful framework to\nwork with in trying to elucidate the foundations of legality and legal\nphenomena more generally. This potential metaphysical interest in\njurisprudence is at its infancy presently, and time will tell if this\nnew approach gets us interesting results.\n",
