    "main_text": "Varieties of Transformative Experience || Love and Relationships\n1.3 Love and Relationships\n\nLove has the power to transform us little by little. In fact, this\nincremental change is one of the fascinating features of love when put\nin the context of transformative experience (see Paul 2014). Smiling\nat a new acquaintance is not transformative, nor is grabbing coffee\nwith them. Once you\u2019ve had coffee, eating dinner together is not\ntransformative either. On and on each step goes. Yet, by the end of\nthings, when you look back at a relationship that\u2019s decades\nlong, you realize that you could not have imagined what it would be\nlike to bond with another person in such an intimate way. The way you\napproached life, the preferences and life projects you developed, and\nthe way love\u2019s rose-tinted glasses filtered the way you see the\nworld have radically changed you. On the flip side, ending this sort\nof relationship is also wildly transformative, especially if\nyou\u2019ve formed a sense of identity that revolves around your\nbeloved. Furthermore, because it\u2019s not clear that reason ever\nrequires that you love someone in a romantic way, it\u2019s difficult\nto explain how choosing love or rejecting it could be done rationally.\nThus, opening oneself up to love or boldly ending it invites\ntransformation and raises questions about whether doing so could ever\nbe defended rationally.\n",
