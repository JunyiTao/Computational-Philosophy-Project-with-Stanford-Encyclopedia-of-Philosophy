    "main_text": "The Roman Republic and Cicero || De re publica\n6.2 De re publica\n\nDe re publica was composed by Cicero between 54 and 51 BCE, a\nturbulent period of strife in Roman politics. Its dramatic setting is\nin 129 BCE during the crisis caused by Tiberius Gracchus, a consul who\nhad championed a property redistribution law for the people and whom\nmembers of the Senate had violently suppressed as a putative threat to\nRoman civil order. All of it except the \u201cDream of Scipio\u201d\n(Book VI) was lost from the Middle Ages onward; it has been\nreconstructed from references and excerpts in later authors,\nsupplemented by a palimpsest of much of Books I\u2013III discovered\nin 1819. Framed as a dialogue between Scipio Aemilianus, a hero of the\nresistance against Tiberius Gracchus and his like-minded brother, and\nseveral others of his actual contemporaries, the dialogue has a\ndiscernible structure identified by E.M. Atkins (2000: 490): Books\nI\u2013II treat \u201cthe best condition of the res\npublica\u201d; Books III\u2013IV treat \u201cjustice and human\nnature\u201d, topics common to the best city and the best citizen;\nand Books V\u2013VI treat the \u201cbest citizen\u2019 in\ndiscussing the statesman and in the Dream of Scipio.\n\nWhile justice was for Cicero, as for the Greeks, the fundamental bond\nof the commonwealth, he offered distinctive and influential linked\ndefinitions of the res publica (\u201dcommonwealth\u201c,\nor more literally the \u201dpublic thing\u201c) as the res\npopuli, the \u201dproperty/thing of the people\u201c, and of a\npopulus or \u201dpeople\u201c in turn as \u201dan\nassemblage associated with one another by agreement on\n\u201claw\u201d [iuris consensu] and community of interest\n[utilitatis communione]\u201c (both, I.39). This could be\ninterpreted either as a strong normative claim\u2014the people agree\non \u201dlaw\u201c [ius], also translatable as right or\njustice, and share a common interest\u2014or alternatively in a\nweaker deflationary manner, the people nominally accepting a common\nlaw and sharing a common conception of their self-interest which may\nor may not be in accord with\n justice.[14]\n Such ambiguity would be famously exploited by Augustine, who used\nCicero\u2019s definition to argue that lacking justice, conflicted\nand divided republican Rome had been no commonwealth, before offering\nhis own even weaker definition of a \u201dpeople\u201c as those\nunited in (any) common love (City of God, II.21). In\nCicero\u2019s own hands, the definitions were used to stress that the\ncommonwealth was the property of the people, who entrusted it to the\nmagistrates to be used for the common good (I.51\u20132), and that\nthe \u201dwelfare of the people is the supreme law\u201c\n(\u201dsalus populi suprema lex\u201c, De leg. III.8; this\nwas a reference to a maxim in the ancient \u201dTwelve Tables\u201c\ncompendium of Roman law). It followed too that just as Plato denied\nthe title of a (single unified) regime to the imperfect regimes torn\nby civil discord, so Cicero inferred that a corrupt regime was not\nstrictly speaking a res publica at all (III.43\u201348). The\nrole of the statesman (rector rei publicae) is to aim at the\nhappiness of the citizens, defined in a laxer way than most Greek\nphilosophers would allow, as wealth, true glory, and virtue all\ncombined.\n\nThe character Scipio adheres to Greek philosophical principles in\ndeclaring that \u201dthe commonwealth cannot possibly function\nwithout justice\u201c (II.70), adhering to the standard abstract\ndefinition in an Aristotelian vein of justice as \u201dgiving each\ntheir due\u201c (ius suum cuique tribuere). In Book III, two\nother dialogue participants present respectively the famous arguments\ngiven on one day for justice, and on the next day against justice, by\nthe skeptical Greek philosopher and ambassador to Rome Carneades\nduring the embassy in 156/155 BCE mentioned above. Cicero\u2019s\npresentation reverses the order, no doubt to give justice the last\nword.\n\nIn Cicero\u2019s hands, Carneades\u2019 case against justice avails\nitself of the nomos/phusis contrast and of the kind of\nambition for power expressed by Plato\u2019s character Callicles in\nthe Gorgias. Justice is not natural, as it differs radically\namong different peoples; it conflicts with wisdom, which tells us\n\u201dto rule over as many people as possible, to enjoy pleasures, to\nbe powerful, to rule, to be a lord\u201c (III.24b), and it is fatal\nfor states and empires, which can\u2019t survive without injustice.\nIn reply, the speech for justice avails itself of Stoic themes:\n\u201dtrue law is right reason, consonant with nature\u201c; there\nis \u201done eternal and unchangeable law\u201c [i.e. what has come\nto be known as \u201dnatural law\u201c] (III.33). This includes rule\nof the best over the weakest for the benefit of the latter (III.36):\nas in Plato\u2019s Republic, the justice of rulership is not\nexploitation but paternalistic benefit. And as in Plato\u2019s\nRepublic Book X, where the myth of Er supplies a revisionary\nreligious justification for justice (it will help you to choose your\nnext reincarnation well), so Cicero\u2019s Republic\nconcludes with a dream recounted by Scipio Aemilianus about his even\nmore eminent Roman ancestor, Scipio Africanus. The dream describes the\ndivine order which not only rewards humans for just service to their\ncity (VI.13), but also puts human affairs in a cosmic perspective\ndesigned to embolden them to care more for justice than for petty\nhuman advantage:\n\nyou must always look at these heavenly bodies and scorn what is human.\nWhat fame can you achieve in what men say, or what glory can you\nachieve that is worth seeking?\u201d (VI.20)\n\nIn a dramatic rejection even of the traditional Roman motives of honor\nand glory as conventional motivations to virtue, the imagined elder\nstatesman asks: \u201c\u2026and even the people who talk about\nus\u2014how long will they do that?\u201d (VI.21). As Jed W. Atkins\nhas observed (2013:76), glory is in the Dream \u201cfirst devalued,\nand then revalued\u201d, in a Platonically inspired image of\n\u201cthe glory of the heavenly realm to which good statesmen will\nreturn\u201d (2013: 77\u201378).\n",
