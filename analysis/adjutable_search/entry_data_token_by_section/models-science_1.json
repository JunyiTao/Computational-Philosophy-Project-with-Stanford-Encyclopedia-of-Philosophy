    "main_text": "Ontology: What Are Models?\n2. Ontology: What Are Models?\n\nWhat are models? That is, what kind of object are scientists dealing\nwith when they work with a model? A number of authors have voiced\nskepticism that this question has a meaningful answer, because models\ndo not belong to a distinctive ontological category and anything can\nbe a model (Callender and Cohen 2006; Giere 2010; Su\u00e1rez 2004;\nSwoyer 1991; Teller 2001). Contessa (2010) replies that this is a\nnon sequitur. Even if, from an ontological point of view,\nanything can be a model and the class of things that are referred to\nas models contains a heterogeneous collection of different things, it\ndoes not follow that it is either impossible or pointless to develop\nan ontology of models. This is because even if not all models are of a\nparticular ontological kind, one can nevertheless ask to what\nontological kinds the things that are de facto used as models\nbelong. There may be several such kinds and each kind can be analyzed\nin its own right. What sort of objects scientists use as models has\nimportant repercussions for how models perform relevant functions such\nas representation and explanation, and hence this issue cannot be\ndismissed as \u201cjust sociology\u201d.\n\nThe objects that commonly serve as models indeed belong to different\nontological kinds: physical objects, fictional objects, abstract\nobjects, set-theoretic structures, descriptions, equations, or\ncombinations of some of these, are frequently referred to as models,\nand some models may fall into yet other classes of things. Following\nContessa\u2019s advice, the aim then is to develop an ontology for\neach of these. Those with an interest in ontology may see this as a\ngoal in its own right. It pays noting, however, that the question has\nreverberations beyond ontology and bears on how one understands the\nsemantics and the epistemology of models.\n",
