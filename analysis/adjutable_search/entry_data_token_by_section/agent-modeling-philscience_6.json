    "main_text": "Central Research Questions || Peer-disagreement in science\n2.5 Peer-disagreement in science\n\nScientific disagreements are commonly considered vital for scientific\nprogress (Kuhn 1977; Longino 2002; Solomon 2006). They typically go\nhand in hand with theoretical diversity (see\n Section 2.1\n and\n 2.2)\n and stimulate critical interaction among scientists, important for\nthe achievement of scientific objectivity. Nevertheless, an inadequate\nresponse to disagreements may lead to premature rejections of fruitful\ninquiries, to fragmentation of scientific domains and hence to\nconsequences that are counterproductive for the progress of science.\nThis raises the question: how should scientists respond to\ndisagreements with their peers, to lower the chance of a hindered\ninquiry? Which epistemic and methodological norms should they follow\nin such situations?\n\nThis issue has been discussed in the context of the more general\ndebate on peer-disagreement in social epistemology. The problem of\npeer disagreement concerns the question: what is an adequate doxastic\nattitude towards p, upon recognizing that one\u2019s peer\ndisagrees on p? Should one follow a \u201cConciliatory\nNorm\u201d, demanding, for instance, to lower the confidence in\np, split the difference by taking the middle ground between the\nopponent\u2019s belief and one\u2019s own on the issue, or to\nsuspend one\u2019s judgment on p? Or should one rather follow\na \u201cSteadfast Norm\u201d demanding to stick to one\u2019s guns\nand keep the same belief with the same confidence as before\nencountering a disagreeing peer? (For initial arguments in favor of\nthe Conciliatory Norm see, e.g., Elga 2007, Christensen 2010, Feldman\n2006; for arguments in favor of the Steadfast Norm see, e.g., De Cruz\n& De Smedt 2013, Kelp & Douven 2012; for reasons why norms are\ncontext-dependent see, e.g., Kelly 2010 [2011], Konigsberg 2013,\nChristensen 2010, Douven 2010; for a recent critical review of the\ndebate as applied to scientific practice see Longino 2022.)\n\nSimilarly, in case of scientific disagreements and controversies we\ncan ask: should a scientist who is involved in a peer disagreement\nstrive towards weakening her stance by means of a conciliatory norm,\nor should she remain steadfast? What makes this issue particularly\nchallenging in the context of scientific inquiry is that we are not\nonly interested in the epistemic question of an adequate doxastic\nresponse to a disagreement, but also in the methodological (or\ninquisitive) question of how the norms impact the success of\ncollective inquiry as a process. In particular, if scientists\nencounter multiple disagreements throughout their research on a\ncertain topic, will their collective inquiry benefit more from\nindividuals adopting conciliatory attitudes or steadfast ones? ABMs\nnaturally lend themselves as a method for investigating these issues:\nby modeling scientists as guided by different normative responses to a\ndisagreement, we can study the impact of the norms on the communal\ninquiry. We will look at the models studying these issues in\n Section 4.5.\n",
