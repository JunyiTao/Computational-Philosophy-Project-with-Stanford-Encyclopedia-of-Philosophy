    "main_text": "Three Jury Theorems || Condorcet\u2019s Jury Theorem\n2.1 Condorcet\u2019s Jury Theorem\n\nCondorcet\u2019s (1785) jury theorem will be discussed first on\ngrounds of simplicity and historic importance, setting aside concerns\nabout its premises and conclusions. Condorcet\u2019s text does not\nfollow modern mathematics, but many later authors have stated his\ntheorem formally (e.g., Grofman 1975; Grofman, Owen, & Feld\n 1983).[3]\n The theorem operates in a simple formal framework, with only the\nfollowing ingredients:\n\nPrimitives of Condorcet\u2019s Jury Theorem: correctness\nevents \\(R_{1},\\) \\(R_{2}, \\ldots,\\) defined relative to a probability\nspace.\n\nIn these primitives (and those of the two other jury theorems in this\nsection), the correctness events could be replaced by more basic\nprimitives, namely the following random variables: votes (judgments)\nof the individuals \\(1, 2, \\ldots,\\) whose values are alternatives,\nand a \u201cstate\u201d variable, whose value is, or more generally\ndetermines, the correct alternative. Each correctness event \\(R_{i}\\)\nis then defined as the event that \\(i\\)\u2019s vote equals the\ncorrect alternative, and the whole analysis stays unchanged. For\ninstance, in a court\u2019s decision problem, the votes of judges\ncould take values in \\(\\{\\text{convict},\\text{acquit}\\}\\) and the\nstate could take values in \\(\\{\\text{guilty},\\text{innocent}\\}\\),\nwhere \\(\\text{convict}\\) is correct if the state is \\(guilty\\), and\n\\(\\text{acquit}\\) is correct if the state is \\(innocent\\).\nEquivalently, and more parsimoniously, votes and state could all take\nvalues in \\(\\{0,1\\}\\), where \\(R_{i}\\) is the event that \\(i\\)\u2019s\nvote equals the\n state.[4]\n\nCondorcet\u2019s theorem assumes that correctness is independent\nacross individuals and has (the same) probability greater\n\\(\\frac{1}{2}\\) for each individual. Formally:\n\nUnconditional Independence (UI). The individual\ncorrectness events \\(R_{1},\\) \\(R_{2}, \\ldots\\) are (unconditionally)\nindependent.\n\nUnconditional Competence (UC). The (unconditional)\nindividual correctness probability \\(P(R_{i})\\)\u2014the general\ncompetence\u2014exceeds \\(\\frac{1}{2}\\) and is the same for all\nindividuals \\(i\\).\n\nCondorcet\u2019s Jury Theorem: Assuming UI and UC,\nthe probability of majority correctness, \\(P(\\Maj_{n})\\), increases in\n (odd[5])\n group size \\(n\\) and converges to 1.\n\nThis theorem paints an optimistic picture of the wisdom of crowds, by\nconcluding that majority outcomes are not only increasingly reliable\nas voters are added, but also infallible in the limit.\n\n\n\nFigure 1. The probability of majority\ncorrectness for different group sizes and competence levels. [An\n extended description of Figure 1\n is in the supplement.]\n\n\nFigure 1\n illustrates increasing majority reliability, for different levels of\nindividual competence \\(p=P(R_{i})\\). Note the fast convergence to\none, even for just slightly competent individuals.\n\nWhy does this theorem hold? Intuitively, UI and UC imply that the\nindividual judgments behave like independent tosses of the same coin\nbiased towards the truth. The more often the coin is tossed, the more\nlikely the majority of the tosses are \u201ccorrect\u201d, and this\nlikelihood converges to one.\n\nTechnically, the increasing-reliability conclusion follows via a\nnon-trivial combinatorial argument. The infallibility conclusion has\nan easy proof, which can be sketched here. By UC, general competence\n\\(p=P(R_{i})\\) is voter-independent. The group\u2019s proportion of\ncorrect votes is a random variable that converges stochastically to\n\\(p\\) by the law of large numbers, using UI. So, as\n\\(p>\\frac{1}{2}\\) by UC, the probability that this proportion\nexceeds \\(\\frac{1}{2}\\), which is precisely \\(P(\\Maj_{n})\\), converges\nto 1 as \\(n\\rightarrow\\infty\\).\n\nAlthough \u201cincreases\u201d should be read as \u201cweakly\nincreases\u201d in Condorcet\u2019s and the other two jury theorems,\nthe stronger conclusion of strictly increasing \\(P(\\Maj_{n})\\) holds\nin all non-degenerate cases of these\n theorems.[6]\n",
