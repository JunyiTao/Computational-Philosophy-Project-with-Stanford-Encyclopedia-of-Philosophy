    "main_text": "Sensation\n13. Afterword\n\nThis has been a short tour\u2014concentrating on the philosophy of\nlanguage and mind\u2014through but a patch of the rich philosophical\nlandscape that Ryle has charted. Left out are a number of themes and\ninterests of Ryle, for example, his discussion of traditions in\nphilosophy from Plato, through the Phenomenological tradition and the\nwork of Brentano, Husserl, and then Heidegger, through the trenchant\nexposition of Wittgenstein\u2019s Tractatus, to his\ncriticism of Carnap, to Collingwood, and Anderson. I have not\ncommented on the dissolution of philosophical problems\nhe presented in his Tarner Lectures; nor have I been able to include\ndiscussions on morality, feelings, pleasure, and much more. Nor is\nthis reading of Ryle a standard one: even many of his students\ninterpreted him as a behaviourist and irrealist. I hope it is enough,\nhowever, to raise the possibility that his work has been widely\nmisunderstood, is presently underestimated, and that he has a lot to\ncontribute to today\u2019s debates.\n",
