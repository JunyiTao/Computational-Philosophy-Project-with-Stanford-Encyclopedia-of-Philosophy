The\naccount is a retrocausal picture based on Hamilton\u2019s principle\nand the symmetric constraint of both initial and final boundary\nconditions to construct equations of motion from a Lagrangian, and is\na natural setting for a perspectival interventionist account of\ncausality. Wharton treats external measurements as physical\nconstraints imposed on a system in the same way that boundary\nconstraints are imposed on the action integral of Hamilton\u2019s\nprinciple; the final measurement does not simply reveal preexisting\nvalues of the parameters, but constrains those values (just as the\ninitial boundary condition would). Wharton\u2019s model has been\ndescribed as an \u201call-at-once\u201d approach, since the dynamics\nof physical systems between an initial and final boundary emerges\nen bloc as the solution to a two-time boundary value\nproblem.\n\nOn this interpretation, one considers reality exclusively between two\ntemporal boundaries as being described by a classical field \\(\\phi\\)\nthat is a solution to the Klein-Gordon equation: specification of\nfield values at both an initial and final boundary (as opposed to\nfield values and their rate of change at only the initial boundary)\nconstrains the field solutions between the boundaries. Wharton argues\nthat constraining such fields at both an initial and a final boundary\n(or a closed hypersurface in spacetime) generates two strikingly\nquantum features: quantization of certain field properties and\ncontextuality of the unknown parameters characterizing the field\nbetween the boundaries. (That there are unknown parameters before the\nimposition of the final condition is ensured due to the\nunderdetermination of the classical field by specifying only the field\nvalues, and not their rate of change, in the initial data.)\n\nFrom within Wharton\u2019s picture, an invariant joint probability\ndistribution associated with each possible pair of initial and final\nconditions can be constructed, and the usual conditional probabilities\ncan be formed by conditioning on any chosen portion of the boundary\n(Wharton 2010a,b). Probability is then a manifestation of our\nignorance: if one knew only the initial boundary, one would only be\nable to describe the subsequent field probabilistically (due to the\nfuture constraint); given the final boundary as well, one would then\nbe able to retrodict the field values between the two boundaries. (See\nEvans, Gryb, and Th\u00e9bault 2016 for a proposed extension of this\nschema to the cosmological context.)\n\nIn more recent work (Wharton 2016), Wharton explores the prospects for\na realist retrocausal interpretation of quantum theory based on the\nFeynman path integral formalism (Feynman 1942). In that formalism as\napplied to a single particle undergoing position measurements at\nspacetime points \\((\\mathbf{x_0},t_0)\\) and \\((\\mathbf{x_1},t_1)\\),\nthe joint probability distribution for all pairs of points and given\ntimes \\(t_0\\) and \\(t_1\\) is given by  \n\\[\\tag{5}\nP(\\mathbf{x_0},\\mathbf{x_1})=\\left|\\sum_{\\mathbf{x_0}\\mapsto\\mathbf{x_1}}\\exp(iS/\\hbar)\\right|^2\\,.\\label{eq:feynman}\n\\]\n\n\nThe sum in this formula is to be understood as the infinitesimal limit\nof a discretized set of spacetime trajectories connecting\n\\((\\mathbf{x_0},t_0)\\) and \\((\\mathbf{x_1},t_1)\\). S is the\nclassical action of the particle along the respective trajectory.\n\nA straightforward but naive interpretation of this equation according\nto which the probability reflects ignorance concerning the path taken\ndoes not work because the right hand side of Eq. (\\ref{eq:feynman}) is\nnot a sum of positive numbers (interpretable as probabilities of\ntrajectories) but rather a positive number obtained by taking the\nmodulus squared of a sum of complex numbers. Wharton explores the\nprospects for giving an ignorance interpretation of the path integral\nalong less straightforward lines, noting that Eq. (\\ref{eq:feynman})\ncan be brought into the form  \n\\[\\tag{6}\nP(\\mathbf{x_0},\\mathbf{x_1})=\\sum_{c_i}\\left|\\sum_{A\\in c_i}\\exp(iS_A/\\hbar)\\right|^2\\,,\\label{eq:wharton}\n\\]\n\n\nwhere the \\(\\left|c_i\\right|\\) are distinct groups of\ntrajectories A. The form Eq. (\\ref{eq:wharton}), according\nto Wharton, invites an interpretation of the probability in terms of\nignorance concerning the actual group of trajectories \\(c_i\\), and he\ntentatively proposes a field interpretation of the \\(c_i\\). The\ninterpretation is retrocausal because the probabilities over groups of\ntrajectories are influenced by the future measurement time and\nsetting. Open questions for this approach concern the grouping of\ntrajectories, which is so far inherently ambiguous, the details of the\nsuggested field interpretation, as well as generalizations to\nmany-particle and other more general settings.\n6.7 The Q-based interpretation\n\nThe Husimi Q-function (Husimi 1940) is a non-negative distribution\nfunction on phase space with a wide applicability, e.g. in quantum\noptics. It is obtained from the better known Wigner function (Wigner\n1932) by smoothening with a Gaussian filter. The Q-based\ninterpretation (Drumond and Reid 2020; Friederich 2021) assumes that\nany quantum system has a precise phase space location, and that phase\nspace locations are distributed according to the Q-function. As a\nconsequence, all dynamical variables of all quantum systems have\ndefinite values in this interpretation, and the measurement problem is\navoided.\n\nDrummond and Reid (2020) argue that this interpretation avoids the\nno-go theorems discussed in\n \u00a73\n via the retrocausality loophole. In support of this claim, they point\nto a result by Drummond (2021), according to which, for a wide class\nof quantum field theories, the Q-function evolves via diffusion\nbackward in time for half of all degrees of freedom (and forward for\nthe other half). Friederich (2021) suggests that failure of temporal\nlocality, independently motivated by Adlam (2018, 2022), could also\nmake those theorems inapplicable to the Q-based interpretation.\n\nIt is not immediately obvious that the Q-based interpretation is\nempirically adequate since it does not exactly reproduce the quantum\nprobabilities derived from the Born rule. However, as argued by\nDrummond and Reid (2020), for various measurement setups and at the\nlevel of macroscopic measurement devices, the discrepancy with\nstandard quantum mechanics based on the Born rule may not be\ndetectable. Friederich (2021) provides a general argument that the\nQ-based interpretation is practically indistinguishable from standard\nquantum mechanics at the level of measurement devices, parallelling\nthe standard argument for the empirical adequacy of Bohmian mechanics,\nas sketched in the entry on\n Bohmian mechanics,\n \u00a710. Interestingly, a version of Bohmian mechanics that also\ntreats the Husimi function as the actual phase space probability\ndistribution was earlier suggested by de Polavieja (1996).\n7. Objections Against Retrocausality in Quantum Mechanics\n\nThis final section reviews some of the most common, and then two of\nthe most significant, objections against the proposal of\nretrocausality in quantum mechanics.\n7.1 General Arguments Against Retrocausality\n\nThere is a tradition in philosophy for regarding the very idea of\nretrocausality as incoherent. The most prominent worry (Flew 1954,\nBlack 1956), is the so-called \u201cbilking argument\u201d (see the\nentry on\n time travel).\n Imagine a pair of events, a cause, C, and an effect, E,\nwhich we believe to be retrocausally connected (E occurs\nearlier in time than C). It seems possible to devise an\nexperiment which could confirm whether our belief in the retrocausal\nconnection is correct or not. Namely, once we had observed that\nE had occurred, we could then set about ensuring that C\ndoes not occur, thereby breaking any retrocausal connection that could\nhave existed between them. If we were successful in doing this, then\nthe effect would have been \u201cbilked\u201d of its cause.\n\nThe bilking argument drives one towards the claim that any belief an\nagent might hold in the positive retrocausal correlation between event\nC and event E is simply false. However, Dummett (1964)\ndisputes that giving up this belief is the only solution to the\nbilking argument. Rather, according to Dummett, what the bilking\nargument actually shows is that a set of three conditions concerning\nthe two events, and the agent\u2019s relationship to them, is\nincoherent:\n\nThere exists a positive correlation between an event C and\nan event E.\nEvent C is within the power of an agent to perform.\nThe agent has epistemic access to the occurrence of event E\nindependently of any intention to bring it about.\n\n\nIt is interesting to note that these conditions do not specify in\nwhich order events C and E occur. On simple reflection,\nthere is a perfectly natural reason why it is not possible to bilk\nfuture effects of their causes, since condition (iii) fails\nto hold for future events: we simply have no access to which future\nevents occur independently of the role we play as causal agents to\nbring the events about. When we lack that epistemic access to past\nevents, the same route out of the bilking argument becomes\navailable.\n\nDummett\u2019s defense against the bilking argument is especially\nrelevant to quantum mechanics. In fact, once a suitable specification\nis made of how condition (iii) can be violated, we find that there\nexists a strong parallel between the conditions which need to hold to\njustify a belief in bringing about the past and the structure of\nquantum mechanics. Price (1996: 174) points out that bilking is\nimpossible in the following circumstances: rather than suppose that a\nviolation of condition (iii) entails that the relevant agent has\nno epistemic access to the relevant past events independently\nof any intention to bring them about, suppose that the means by which\nknowledge of these past events is gathered breaks the claimed\ncorrelation between the agent\u2019s action and those past events.\nSuch a condition can be stated as follows:\n\nThe agent can gain epistemic access to the occurrence of event\nE independently of any intention to bring it about and without\naltering event E from what it would have been had no epistemic\naccess been gained.\n\n\nThe significance of this weakened violation of condition (iii) is that\nit is just the sort of condition one would expect to hold if the\nsystem in question were a quantum system. The very nature of quantum\nmechanics ensures that any claimed positive correlation between the\nfuture measurement settings and the hidden variables characterizing a\nquantum system cannot possibly be bilked of their causes because\ncondition (iv) is perennially violated. Moreover, so long as we\nsubscribe to the epistemic interpretation of the wavefunction, we lack\nepistemic access to the \u201chidden\u201d variables of the system\nand we lack this access in principle as a result of the\nstructure of quantum theory.\n\nAnother prominent challenge against the very idea of retrocausality is\nthat it inevitably would give rise to vicious causal loops (Mellor\n1998). (See Faye 1994 for a response and the entry on\n backward causation\n for a more detailed review of the objections raised against the idea\nof retrocausality.)\n7.2 Retrocausality Just Is Superdeterminism\n\nRecall\n (\u00a73.1)\n that retrocausality can be motivated as an explicit violation of the\nassumption of measurement independence (Eq. (\\ref{eq:independence}))\nas a means of circumventing Bell\u2019s theorem. But there is another\npossible mechanism that might underpin violations of measurement\nindependence, namely, superdeterminism. This is the idea that, in the\nterminology of\n \u00a73,\n the joint past of (i) the measurement setting \\(\\alpha\\) and (ii) the\nhidden state of the measured system \\(\\lambda\\) determines both of\nthem completely and induces the relevant quantum correlations between\nthem (see the entry on\n Bell\u2019s Theorem,\n \u00a78.1.1, and references therein). Hossenfelder (2020) argues\nagainst referring to violations of measurement independence as\n\u2018retrocausality\u2019, preferring to consider such violations\nas exclusively instances of \u2018superdeterminism\u2019, since\n\u201cthe idea of a cause propagating back in time is\nmeaningless\u201d (2020:10; see also Hossenfelder and Palmer (2020)).\nThe essential point of contention here, and Hossenfelder points this\nout explicitly, is that each of retrocausality and superdeterminism\ninvokes a different understanding of the nature of causality.\n\nThe characterisation of causality that Hossenfelder (2020: 10) takes\nto undermine the proposal of retrocausality is that A is a\ncause of B if and only if A and B are correlated\nand B is in the forward lightcone of A: \u201cIf you\nthink you have a situation where B \u201dretrocauses\u201c A,\nthen this merely means A causes B\u201d. In this way,\nsuch correlations between events should never be understood as\nretrocausal, and should always be understood as superdeterministic.\nThis characterization of causality is reminiscent of Hume\u2019s\nconventionalism about cause and effect, according to which it is\nsimply a matter of terminology that causes must precede their effects\n(see the entry on\n Backward Causation,\n \u00a72.3). As noted in the metaphysical preliminaries set out in\n \u00a72.1,\n the conception of causality that most naturally coheres with the\nproposal of retrocausality is an interventionist one. Hossenfelder\nacknowledges this, and argues that the reason the interventionist\naccount of causation is inappropriate as a proposal in the quantum\ncontext \u201cis that \u201dagents\u201c and their\n\u201dinterventions\u201c are macroscopic terms that do not appear\nin quantum mechanics\u201d.\n\nWhat Hossenfelder\u2019s critique emphasizes is that retrocausality\nrequires a certain package of metaphysical views to be a viable\nproposal. Hossenfelder\u2019s analysis relies on a conception of\ncausality that is at odds with the interventionist account, especially\nas understood along perspectival lines, as outlined in\n \u00a72.1.\n As a result, a defence of retrocausality against Hossenfelder\u2019s\nobjection would need to defend the fruitfulness of this account of\ncausality.\n7.3 Retrocausality Requires Fine Tuning\n\nCausal modeling (Spirtes, Glymour, & Scheines 2000; Pearl 2009) is\na practice that has arisen from the field of machine learning that\nconsists in the development of algorithms that can automate the\ndiscovery of causes from correlations in large data sets. The causal\ndiscovery algorithms permit an inference from given statistical\ndependences and independences between distinct measurable elements of\nsome system to a causal model for that system. As part of the\nalgorithms, a series of constraints must be placed on the resulting\nmodels that capture general features that we take to be characteristic\nof causality. Two of the more significant assumptions are (i) the\ncausal Markov condition, which ensures that every statistical\ndependence in the data results in a causal dependence in the\nmodel\u2014essentially a formalization of Reichenbach\u2019s common\ncause principle\u2014and (ii) faithfulness, which ensures that every\nstatistical independence implies a causal independence, or no causal\nindependence is the result of a fine-tuning of the model.\n\nIt has long been recognized (Butterfield 1992; Hausman 1999; Hausman\n& Woodward 1999) that quantum correlations force one to give up at\nleast one of the assumptions usually made in the causal modeling\nframework. Wood and Spekkens (2015) argue that any causal model\npurporting to causally explain the observed quantum\ncorrelations must be fine-tuned (i.e., must violate the faithfulness\nassumption). More precisely, according to them, since the observed\nstatistical independences in an entangled bipartite quantum system\nimply no signaling between the parties, when it is then assumed that\nevery statistical independence implies a causal independence (which is\nwhat faithfulness dictates), it must be inferred that there can be no\n(direct or mediated) causal link between the parties. Since there is\nan observed statistical dependence between the outcomes of\nmeasurements on the bipartite system, we can no longer account for\nthis dependence with a causal link unless this link is fine tuned to\nensure that the no-signaling independences still hold. There is thus a\nfundamental tension between the observed quantum correlations and the\nno-signaling requirement, the faithfulness assumption and the\npossibility of a causal explanation.\n\nFormally, Wood and Spekkens argue that the following three assumptions\nform an inconsistent set: (i) the predictions of quantum theory\nconcerning the observed statistical dependences and independences are\ncorrect; (ii) the observed statistical dependences and independences\ncan be given a causal explanation; (iii) the faithfulness assumption\nholds. Wood and Spekkens conclude that, since the faithfulness\nassumption is an indispensable element of causal discovery, the second\nassumption must yield. The contrapositive of this is that any\npurported causal explanation of the observed correlations in an\nentangled bipartite quantum system falls afoul of the tension between\nthe no-signaling constraint and no fine tuning and, thus, must violate\nthe assumption of faithfulness. Such causal explanations, so the\nargument goes, including retrocausal explanations, should therefore be\nruled out as viable explanations.\n\nAs a brief aside, this fine-tuning worry for retrocausality in the\nquantum context arises in a more straightforward way. There is no good\nevidence to suggest that signaling towards the past is possible; that\nis, there is no retrocausality at the operational level. (Pegg 2006,\n2008 argues that this can be explained formally as a result of the\ncompleteness condition on the measurement operators, introducing an\nasymmetry in normalization conditions for preparation and\nmeasurement.) Yet, despite there being no signaling towards the past,\nretrocausal accounts assume causal influences towards past. That these\ncausal influences do not show up as statistical dependences\nexploitable for signaling purposes raises exactly the same fine-tuning\nworry as Wood and Spekkens raise.\n\nAn obvious response to the challenge set by Wood and Spekkens is to\nsimply reject the assumption of faithfulness. But this should not be\ntaken lightly; the intuition behind the faithfulness assumption is\nbasic and compelling. When no statistical correlation exists between\nthe occurrences of a pair of events, there is no reason for supposing\nthere to be a causal connection between them. Conversely, if we were\nto allow the possibility of a causal connection between statistically\nuncorrelated events, we would have a particularly hard task\ndetermining which of these uncorrelated sets could be harboring a\nconspiratorial causal connection that hides the correlation. The\nfaithfulness assumption is thus a principle of parsimony\u2014the\nsimplest explanation for a pair of statistically uncorrelated events\nis that they are causally independent\u2014much the same way that\nSpekkens\u2019 (2005) definition of contextuality is, too (see\n \u00a73.2);\n indeed, Cavalcanti (2018) argues that contextuality can be construed\nas a form of fine-tuning.\n\nThere are, however, well-known examples of systems that potentially\nshow a misapplication of the faithfulness assumption. One such\nexample, originating in Hesslow (1976), involves a contraceptive pill\nthat can cause thrombosis while simultaneously lowering the chance of\npregnancy, which can also cause thrombosis. As Cartwright (2001: 246)\npoints out, given the right weight for these process, it is\nconceivable that the net effect of the pills on the frequency of\nthrombosis be zero. This is a case of \u201ccancelling paths\u201d,\nwhere the effect of two or more causal routes between a pair of\nvariables cancels to achieve statistical independence. In a case such\nas this, since we can have independent knowledge of the separate\ncausal mechanisms involved here, there are grounds for arguing that\nthere really is a causal connection between the variables despite\ntheir statistical independence. Thus, it is certainly possible to\nimagine a scenario in which the faithfulness assumption could lead us\nastray. However, in defense of the general principle, an example such\nas this clearly contains what Wood and Spekkens refer to as fine\ntuning; the specific weights for these processes would need to match\nprecisely to erase the statistical dependence, and such a balance\nwould generally be thought as unstable (any change in background\nconditions, etc. would reveal the causal connection in the form of a\nstatistical dependence).\n\nN\u00e4ger (2016) raises the possibility that unfaithfulness can occur\nwithout conspiratorial fine tuning if the unfaithfulness arises in a\nstable way. In the quantum context, N\u00e4ger suggests that the\nfine-tuning mechanism is what he calls \u201cinternal cancelling\npaths\u201d. This mechanism is analogous to the usual cancelling\npaths scenario, but the path-cancelling mechanism does not manifest at\nthe level of variables, but at the level of values. On this view, such\nfine tuning would occur as a result of the particular causal and/or\nnomological process that governs the system, and it is in this sense\nthat the cancelling paths mechanism is internal, and it is the fact\nthat the mechanism is internal that renders the associated fine tuning\nstable to external disturbances. Thus \n\n\nif the laws of nature are such that disturbances always alter the\ndifferent paths in a balanced way, then it is physically impossible to\nunbalance the paths. (N\u00e4ger 2016: 26) \n\n\nThe possibility raised by N\u00e4ger would circumvent the problem that\nviolations of faithfulness ultimately undermine our ability to make\nsuitable inferences of causal independence based on statistical\nindependence by allowing only a specific kind of\nunfaithfulness\u2014a principled or law-based unfaithfulness that is\n\u201cinternal\u201d and is thus stable to background\nconditions\u2014which is much less conspiratorial, as the fine-tuning\nis a function of the specific process involved. Evans (2018) argues\nthat a basic retrocausal model of the sort envisaged by Costa de\nBeauregard (see\n \u00a71)\n employs just such an internal cancelling paths explanation to account\nfor the unfaithful (no signaling) causal channels. See also Almada et\nal. (2016) for an argument that fine tuning in the quantum context is\nrobust and arises as a result of symmetry considerations. Furthermore,\nEvans (2021) argues that, to the letter of Wood and Spekkens\u2019\nanalysis, cases of fine tuning may be more ubiquitous than we suspect,\nand so we should not be so worried about such quantum cases.\n7.4 Contextuality for Exotic Causal Structures\n\nRecall\n (\u00a73.2)\n that Spekkens\u2019 (2005) claim that no noncontextual ontological\nmodel can reproduce the observed statistics of quantum theory based on\nhis principle of parsimony (that there can be no ontological\ndifference without operational difference) was sidestepped by\nretrocausal approaches due to the explicit assumption of the\nontological models framework that the ontic state is independent of\nthe measurement procedure (i.e., that there is no retrocausality). It\nwas noted there the possibility that Spekkens\u2019 principle of\nparsimony might be recast to apply more generally to retrocausal\nmodels. Shrapnel and Costa (2018) achieve just this in a no-go theorem\nthat applies to any exotic causal structure used to sidestep the\nontological models framework, including retrocausal accounts,\nrendering such models contextual after all.\n\nShrapnel and Costa\u2019s result is based on a generalization of the\nontological models framework which replaces the operational\npreparation, transformation, and measurement procedures with the\ntemporally and causally neutral notions of local controllables and\nenvironmental processes that mediate correlations between different\nlocal systems, and generate the joint statistics for a set of events.\n\u201cThese include any global properties, initial states, connecting\nmechanisms, causal influence, or global dynamics\u201d (2018: 5).\nFurthermore, they replace the ontic state \\(\\lambda\\) with the ontic\n\u201cprocess\u201d \\(\\omega\\):\n\n\nour ontic process captures the physical properties of the world that\nremain invariant under our local operations. That is, although we\nallow local properties to change under specific operations,\nwe wish our ontic process to capture those aspects of reality\nthat are independent of this probing. (2018: 8)\n\n\nAs a result, the notion of \\(\\lambda\\)-mediation (encountered in\n \u00a74.1)\n is replaced by the notion of \\(\\omega\\)-mediation, in which the ontic\nprocess \\(\\omega\\) completely specifies the properties of the\nenvironment that mediate correlations between regions, and screens off\noutcomes produced by local controllables from the rest of the\nenvironment. Shrapnel and Costa (2018: 9) define the notion of\n\u201cinstrument noncontextuality\u201d as a law of parsimony (along\nthe lines of Spekkens\u2019 own definition of noncontextuality):\n\u201cOperationally indistinguishable pairs of outcomes and local\ncontrollables should remain indistinguishable at the ontological\nlevel\u201d. They then show that no instrument noncontextual model\ncan reproduce the quantum statistical predictions.\n\n\nCrucially, what is contextual is not just the traditional notion of\n\u201cstate\u201d, but any supposedly objective feature of the\ntheory, such as a dynamical law or boundary condition. (2018: 2)\n\n\nSince preparations, transformations, and measurements have been\nreplaced by local controllables, there is no extra assumption in\nShrapnel and Costa\u2019s framework that \\(\\omega\\) is correlated\nwith some controllables but independent of others. Thus the usual\nroute out of the ontological models framework, and so the no-go\ntheorems of\n \u00a73,\n open to retrocausal approaches\u2014that the framework assumes no\nretrocausality\u2014is closed off in the Shrapnel-Costa theorem,\nrendering retrocausal approaches contextual along with the rest of the\nmodels captured by the ontological models framework.\n\nThis presents a significant worry for retrocausal approaches to\nquantum theory. If the main motivation for pursing the hypothesis of\nretrocausality is to recapture in some sense a classical ontology for\nquantum theory (see\n \u00a73.4),\n then the Shrapnel-Costa theorem has made this task either impossible,\nor beholden to the possibility of some further story explaining how\nthe contextual features of the model arise from some noncontextual\nfooting. On this latter point, it is difficult to see how this story\nmight be told without significantly reducing the ideological economy\nof the conceptual framework of retrocausality, again jeopardizing a\npotential virtue of retrocausality (see Evans 2020 for further\ndiscussion of this point).\n\nAs mentioned above\n (\u00a77.3),\n contextuality can be construed as a form of fine tuning (Cavalcanti\n2018; Adlam 2021), especially when the demand for noncontextuality is\nunderstood as a requirement of parsimony, as above. The worries raised\nin this section and the last underline the fact that the challenge to\naccount for various types of fine tuning is the most serious\nprincipled obstacle that retrocausal accounts continue to face.",
