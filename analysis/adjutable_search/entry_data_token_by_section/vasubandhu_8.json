    "main_text": "Major Yog\u0101c\u0101ra Arguments and Positions || Disproof of Sensory Objects\n4.2 Disproof of Sensory Objects\n\nIn order to disprove the possibility of external objects, Vasubandhu\ndelves into the atomic theory of the Kashimiri Vaibh\u0101\u1e63ikas\nas well as that of the (\u201corthodox\u201d/Hindu)\n Vai\u015be\u1e63ikas.[39]\n The purpose here is to undermine every possible theory that might\naccount for perception as caused by non-mental entities.\nVasubandhu\u2019s argument at this stage is entirely based in\nmereology\u2014the study of the relations between parts and wholes.\nHe argues first that atomism\u2014the view that things are ultimately\nmade up of parts that are themselves partless\u2014cannot work. Then,\nhe argues that any reasonable explanation of objects of perception\nmust be atomic, by arguing that the alternative\u2014an\nextended, partless whole\u2014is incoherent. Vasubandhu takes it that\ntogether, these conclusions prove that external objects must be unreal\nappearances.\n\nI can only summarize Vasubandhu\u2019s sophisticated mereological\narguments. He begins with the assertion that anything that serves as a\nsensory object must be a whole made up of basic parts, a bare\nmultiplicity of basic parts, or an aggregate. But none of these can\nwork. A whole made up of parts is rejected on the grounds that things\nare not perceived over and above their parts. This is a well-developed\nBuddhist \u0100bhidharmika view, which coheres with the rejection of a\nself over and above the aggregates. A bare multiplicity of partless\nparts is rejected on the grounds that separate atoms are not perceived\nseparately. Thus the only sensible option is a grouping of\nparts\u2014an aggregate\u2014that somehow becomes perceptible by\nbeing joined together.\n\nThe combination of partless entities, however, is conceptually\nimpossible. Vasubandhu points out that if they if they combine on one\n\u201cside\u201d with one atom and another \u201cside\u201d with\nanother\u2014those \u201csides\u201d are parts. The opponent must\naccount for the relation between those parts and the whole, and we are\nbrought back to the beginning. Furthermore, if they are infinitesimal,\nthey cannot be combined into larger objects.\n\nIt is proposed, instead, that perhaps a partless entity may be\nextended in space, and so perceived. But perception is generated by\ncontact between a sensory organ and its object. This requires the\nobject to put up some kind of resistance. But if a thing has no parts,\nthen its near side is its far side, which means that to be adjacent to\nit is to have passed it by. Partless atoms are therefore logically\nincapable of providing the resistance that is definitive of\nphysicality and the basis for sensory contact (Vasubandhu says that\nthey cannot produce light on one side and shade on the other). This\nconfirms that entities must be combined into larger groupings in order\nto be functional and perceptible, which has already been shown\nimpossible.\n\nIf atoms and extended partless entities are impossible, so also are\nunitary sensory objects. Vasubandhu is well practiced in the\nAbhidharma arguments reducing apparent wholes to their composite\nentities. Suppose we say I see something that has both blue and yellow\nin it. How, if it is one unitary thing, can I see these two colors at\ndifferent points? What makes one point in an object different from\nanother point, if the object is of a single nature? This is clearly\nparallel to the argument against \u012a\u015bvara as a single cause of\nall things. A similar case is movement across an extended thing. As\nwith a partless atom, to step on the near side of a partless extended\nsingular entity would be to step on its far side, too. So there can be\nno gradual movement across a singular entity. As Vasubandhu concludes,\none cannot but derive the need for partless, atomic units from such\nreasoning. But partless atomic units are imperceptible. So, perception\nis impossible; apparently perceived objects are only apparent.\n\nThe main part of his argument settled, Vasubandhu entertains another\nset of counterarguments, which are the charges of solipsism and moral\nnihilism: How, the internal objector asks, can beings interact with\none another? What is the karmic benefit of helping or harming, when we\nare all merely apparent beings? Vasubandhu\u2019s direct, candid\nresponse to these challenges may be viewed as a failure of\nimagination, or a surprising willingness to bite the bullet of\nanti-realism. Mental streams, he says, interact in essentially the\nsame way as we imagine physical objects to interact. Minds affect\nminds directly. When you speak to me, and I hear you, we ordinarily\nthink that your mind causes your mouth to produce sounds that my ears\npick up and transform into mental events in my mind. Vasubandhu takes\nOccam\u2019s razor to this account and says that\u2014given that we\nhave no sensible account of physicality, let alone mental causation of\na physical event and physical causation of a mental event\u2014it\nmakes more sense if we eliminate everything but the evident\ncause and the result: Your mind and mine.\n\nNote that Vasubandhu is not saying that nothing in our appearances\nexists; he is saying, on the contrary, that mere appearances bear all\nthe reality that we need for full intersubjectivity and moral\nresponsibility. It seems worth noting in this context that something\nsimilar to Vasubandhu\u2019s option just may be the only option\navailable for a modern physicalist who believes that human minds are\nconstituted by, or out of, neurons. Human persons, for such a modern,\ndo not exist as we imagine them to, and are not causally constituted\nin ways that we can intuit or even comprehend, except vaguely. Does\nthis mean that we must advert to moral nihilism or solipsism?\nVasubandhu\u2019s alternative is to affirm our pragmatic acceptance\nof our own, and others\u2019 experiences and causal responsibilities,\nand not to imagine that we must await an account of physicality before\ntrusting the effectiveness of our mental, moral, causality. Read in\nthis way, Vasubandhu seems much closer to Madhyamaka philosophy than\nis ordinarily assumed; see Nagao (1991).\n",
