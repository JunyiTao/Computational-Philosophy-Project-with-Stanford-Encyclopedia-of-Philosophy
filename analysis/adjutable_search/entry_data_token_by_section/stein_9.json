    "main_text": "Spirituality and Theological Works\n5. Spirituality and Theological Works\n\nStein\u2019s deep interest in spirituality was initiated by her\nreading of Theresa of Avila\u2019s Book of Her Life, but\ndeepened through her reading of Thomas Aquinas, St. John of the Cross,\nJohn Henry Newman, and Dionysius the Areopagite. Studying Aquinas\nconvinced her that it was possible to serve God and also do\nintellectual work, and she combined her spirituality with intellectual\nendeavors. She wrote several mystical studies, most notably\nScience of the Cross (Stein 2003). Science of the\nCross studies John of the Cross\u2019s mysticism, his search for\nspiritual oneness, and his devotion to love. Stein engages in a\npersonal meditation on the symbolism of the cross and of night (the\ndominant symbol in John of the Cross, Stein 2003: 31[38]). Night is\nsomething natural, invisible and formless, yet not nothing (2003:\n32[39]); it is like a foretaste of death (2003: 32[40]). For Stein,\n\u201cthe night denotes the profound darkness of faith\u201d\n(1950/2006: 35[27]). The mystical night comes not from without but\nfrom within (2003: 34[41]). Only by feeling the weight of the cross\ncan one learn the \u201cscience of the cross\u201d (scientia\ncrucis) which is \u201cburied in the soul like a seed\u201d\n(2003: 5[9\u201310]). The soul must be educated to know God and the\nspiritual side of human being must detach itself from the senses\n(2003: 95[115]). Surrendering to God in faith makes us pure spirits,\nfreed from all images and thus in darkness (2003: 97[118]).\n\u201cDark contemplation\u201d is the secret ladder to God.\n\nOne of Stein\u2019s posthumous publications was a scholarly essay,\n\u201cWays to Know God\u201d, (in Stein 1993) on the Christian\nmystic, Pseudo-Dionysius the Areopagite. For Stein, Dionysius\u2019\nmystical theology is not a scientific discipline but a way to speak\nabout God. Just as perception always points beyond itself, similarly\nour experience of the world points beyond itself to its divine source\n(1993: 27[99]). This world is the basis for natural theology. God is\nthe \u201cprimary theologian\u201d (Ur-Theologe; 1993:\n27[100]) and the whole of creation is his symbolic theology.\nAffirmative theology is based on the analogia entis; negative\ntheology is based on the dissimilarity between creatures and God. For\nStein, negative theology \u201cclimbs the scale of creatures\u201d\nto discover that at each level God is not found there: \u201cWe draw\nnear to God by denying what he is not\u201d (1993: 19[88]).\n\nBut Stein defends human freedom: \u201cthe soul has a right to make\ndecisions for itself\u201d (2003: 134[161]). She was aware that very\nfew people live in their inner depths and even less from out of their\ninner depths (2003: 132[159]). In her Ways to Stillness she\nwrote: \u201cEach of us is perpetually on the razor\u2019s edge: on\none side, absolute nothingness; on the other, the fullness of divine\nlife\u201d (1987: 12).\n",
