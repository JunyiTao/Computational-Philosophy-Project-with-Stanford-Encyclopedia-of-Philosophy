Turning\nto the former, we must distinguish two forms of reductionism,\nphenomenalist and physicalist reductionism. Phenomenalism holds\nstatements to be cognitively significant if they can be reduced to\nstatements about one\u2019s experience, be it outer (senses) or inner\n(introspection). Physicalism holds statements to be cognitively\nsignificant if they can be reduced or evidentially related to\nstatements about physical states of affairs. Here it must be noted not\nonly that the Vienna Circle is typically remembered in terms of the\napparently phenomenalist ambitions of Carnap\u2019s Aufbau\nof 1928, but also that already by the early 1930s some form of\nphysicalism was favoured by some leading members including Carnap\n(1932b) and that already in the Aufbau the possibility of a\ndifferent basis for a conceptual genealogy than the phenomenal one actually chosen had been indicated. Thus one\nmust not only ask about the reductionism in the Aufbau but\nalso consider just how reductivist in intent the physicalism was meant\nto be.\n\nConsiderations can begin with an early critique that has given rise in\nsome quarters to a sharp distinction between Viennese logical\npositivism and German logical empiricism, with the former accused of\nreductionism and the latter praised for their anti-reductionism, a\ndistinction which falsely discounts the changing nature and variety of\nVienna Circle doctrines. Reichenbach\u2019s defense of empiricism\n(1938) turned on the replacement of the criterion of strict\nverifiability with one demanding only that the degree of probability\nof meaningful statements be determinable. This involved opposition\nalso to demands for the eliminative reduction of non-observational to\nobservational statements: both phenomenalism and reductive physicalism\nwere viewed as untenable and a correspondentist realism was advanced\nin their stead. Now it is true that of the members of the Vienna\nCircle only Feigl ever showed sympathies for scientific realism, but\nit is incorrect that all opposition to it in the Circle depended on\nthe naive semantics of early verificationism. Again, of course, some\nVienna Circle positions were liable to Reichenbach\u2019s\ncriticism.\n\nAnother misunderstanding to guard against is that the Vienna\nCircle\u2019s ongoing concern with \u201cfoundational issues\u201d\nand the \u201cfoundations of science\u201d does in itself betoken\nfoundationalism. (In the Vienna Circle\u2019s days, foundationalism\nhad it that the basic items of knowledge upon which all others\ndepended were independent of each other, concerned phenomenal states\nof affairs and were infallible; nowadays, foundationalists drop\nphenomenalism and infallibility.) Already the manifesto sought to make\nclear the Circle\u2019s opposition when it claimed that \u201cthe\nwork of \u2018philosophic\u2019 or \u2018foundational\u2019\ninvestigations remains important in accord with the scientific world\nconception. For the logical clarification of scientific concepts,\nstatements and methods liberates one from inhibiting prejudices.\nLogical and epistemological analysis does not wish to set barriers to\nscientific enquiry; on the contrary, analysis provides science with as\ncomplete a range of formal possibilities as is possible, from which to\nselect what best fits each empirical finding (example: non-Euclidean\ngeometries and the theory of relativity).\u201d (Carnap-Hahn-Neurath\n1929 [1973, 316]) This passage can be read as an early articulation of\nthe project of a critical-constructivist meta-theory of science that\nabjures a special authority of its own beyond that stemming from the\napplication of the methods of the empirical and formal sciences to\nscience itself, but instead remains open to what the actual practice\nof these sciences demands.\n\nHow then can Vienna Circle philosophy be absolved of foundationalism? As\nnoted, it is the Aufbau (and echoes of it in the manifesto)\nthat invites the charge of phenomenalist reductionism. To begin with,\none must distinguish between the strategy of reductionism and the\nambition of foundationalism. Concerning the Aufbau it has\nbeen argued that its strategy of reconstructing empirical knowledge\nfrom the position of methodological solipsism (phenomenalism without\nits ontological commitments and some of its epistemological ambitions)\nis owed not to foundationalist aims but to the ease by which this\nposition seemed to allow the demonstration of the interlocking and\nstructural nature of our system of empirical concepts, a system that\nexhibited unity and afforded objectivity, which was Carnap\u2019s\nmain concern. (See Friedman\u2019s path-breaking 1987 and 1992, and Richardson 1990, 1998, Ryckman\n1991, Pincock 2002, 2005. For the wide variety of influences on the\nAufbau more generally, see Damb\u00f6ck 2016.) However, it is\nhard to deny categorically that Carnap ever harbored foundationalist\nambitions. Not only did Carnap locate his Aufbau very close\nto foundationalism in retrospect (1963a), but a passage in his (1930)\nled Uebel (2007, Ch.6) to claim that around 1929/30 Carnap was motivated by\nfoundationalist principles and reinterpreted his own Aufbau\nalong these lines (around the same time that Wittgenstein\nentertained a psychologistic reinterpretation of his own\nTractatus that was reported back to the Circle by Waismann).\nTo correct this foundationalist aberration was the task of the\nCircle\u2019s subsequent protocol-sentence debate about the content,\nform and status of the evidence statements of science.\n\nThis concession to the foundationalist misinterpretation of Vienna\nCircle philosophies generally must not, however, be taken to tell\nagainst the new reading of the Aufbau or the epistemologies\ndeveloped from 1930 onwards on the physicalist wing of the Circle. In fact, the Aufbau itself fails when it is read as\na foundationalist project, as it was by Quine (1951a) who pointed out\nthat no eliminative definition of the relation \u2018is at\u2019 was\nprovided (required for locating objects of consciousness in physical\nspace). Yet other failures of reduction were detected by Richardson (1998, Ch.3), further questioning the Aufbau\u2019s supposed foundationalist intent. Ultimately it was a still different failure of reduction that prompted Carnap to abandon as\nmistaken reconstructions of the scientific language on the basis of\nmethodological solipsism (though not logical investigations of such languages for their own sake, as noted in his 1961a). Initially Carnap had not been prepared to draw this conclusion even though Neurath (1931b, 1932a) argued that such a type of\nrational reconstruction traded on objectionable\ncounterfactual presuppositions (methodological solipsism did not\nprovide a correct description of the reasoning involved in cognitive\ncommerce with the world around us). At the time Carnap\nmerely conceded that it was more \u201cconvenient\u201d to\nreconstruct the language of science on a physicalistic basis (1932e). Only the failure of reducing dispositional predicates to observational ones convinced him to abandon the methodologically solipsist approach (1936\u201337, 464 and 10) and to adopt an exclusively physicalist basis for his reconstructions of the language of science from then on (a decision explicitly reaffirmed in 1963b). \nCarnap\u2019s initial reluctance to draw this conclusion is best interpreted, not as hankering after epistemological foundations, but as indicating the growing conviction that philosophical methodology had to be built on logical reasons and should not be \u201centangled with psychological\nquestions\u201d (1934/37, \u00a772). Moreover, already Carnap\u2019s initial hope for a phenomenalist reduction in the Aufbau as well as his decision in (1932e) to loosen the methodologically solipsist claim on epistemology were motivated by logical considerations, the former by mistaken ideas in Untersuchungen zur allgemeinen Axiomatik (2000, unpublished at the time) and the latter partly as a consequence of G\u00f6del\u2019s advice on a faulty definition of analyticity in a draft of Logical Syntax (see Ricketts 2010 and Awodey and Carus 2007 respectively).\n\nIt could likewise be asked concerning physicalism whether it represented, on a different basis, the pursuit of a\nfoundationalist agenda. But that Carnap later in\n(1936/37) called his non-eliminative definitions of disposition\nterms \u201creduction sentences\u201d already indicates that it was enough\nfor him to provide a basis for the applicability of these terms by\nmerely sufficient but not necessary conditions. Likewise,\nCarnap\u2019s proposal (1939) to conceive of theoretical terms as\ndefined by implicit definition in a non-interpreted language, selected terms of which were, however, linked via non-eliminative\nreductive chain to the observational language, suggests that what concerned him\nprimarily was the capture of indicator relations to sustain in\nprinciple testability of statements containing the terms in question.\nThis is best understood as an attempt to preserve the empirical\napplicability of the formal languages constructed for high-level theory, but\nnot as reductivism with regard to some foundational given.\n\nBy contrast, Neurath never advocated methodological solipsism. Consider that his\ncomplex conception of the form of protocol statements (1932b)\nexplicated the concept of observational evidence in terms that\nexpressly reflected debts to empirical assumptions which called for\ntheoretical elaboration in turn. For unlike the logician of science\nCarnap, who left it to psychology and brain science to determine more\nprecisely what the class observational predicates were that could\nfeature in protocol statements (1936/37), the empirically oriented\nmeta-theoretician of science Neurath was concerned to encompass and\ncomprehend the practical complexities of reliance on scientific\ntestimony: the different clauses (embeddings) of his proposed protocol\nstatements stand for conditions on the acceptance of such testimony\n(see Uebel 2009). In addition, Neurath\u2019s theory of protocol\nstatements also makes clear that his understanding of physicalism did\nnot entail the eliminative reduction of the phenomenon of\nintentionality but, like Carnap (1932c), merely sought its integration\ninto empiricist discourse.\n\nGiven these different emphases of their respective physicalisms,\nmention must also be made of the significant differences between\nCarnap\u2019s and Neurath\u2019s conceptions of unified science:\nwhere the formalist Carnap once preferred a hierarchical ordering of\nfinitely axiomatized theoretical languages that allowed at least\npartial cross-language definitions and derivations\u2014these\nrequirements were liberalized over the years (1936b), (1938),\n(1939)\u2014the pragmatist Neurath opted from the start to demand\nonly the interconnectability of predictions made in the different\nindividual sciences (1935a), (1936c), (1944). (Metereology, botany and\nsociology must be combinable to predict the consequences of a forest\nfire, say, even though each may have its own autonomous theoretical\nvocabulary.) Here too it must be remembered that, unlike Carnap,\nNeurath only rarely addressed issues in the formal logic of science\nbut mainly concerned himself with the partly contextually fixed\npragmatics of science. (One exception is his 1935b, a coda to his\nprevious contributions to the socialist calculation debate with Ludwig\nvon Mises and others.) Not surprisingly, at times the priorities set\nby Neurath for the pragmatics of science seemed to conflict with those\nof Carnap\u2019s logic of science. (These tensions often were\npalpable in the grand publication project undertaken by Carnap and\nNeurath in conjunction with Morris, the International Encyclopedia of\nthe Unity of Science; see Reisch 2003.) That said, however, note that\nCarnap\u2019s more hierarchical approach to the unity of science also\ndoes not support the attribution of foundationalist ambitions.\n\nBut for a brief lapse around 1929/30 and perhaps in some pre-Vienna years, then,\nCarnap fully represents the position of Vienna Circle\nanti-foundationalism. In this he joined Neurath whose long-standing\nanti-foundationalism is evident from his famous simile, first used in\n1913, that likens scientists to sailors who have to repair their boat\nwithout ever being able to pull into dry dock (1932b). Their positions\ncontrasted at least prima facie with that of Schlick (1934)\nwho explicitly defended the idea of foundations in the Circle\u2019s\nprotocol-sentence debate. Even Schlick conceded, however, that all\nscientific statements were fallible ones, so his position on\nfoundationalism was by no means the traditional one. The point of his\n\u201cfoundations\u201d remained less than wholly clear and\ndifferent interpretation of it have been put forward (e.g., Oberdan 1998, Uebel 1996, 2020). (On the protocol\nsentence debate as a whole, which included not only the debate between\nCarnap and Neurath but also debates between the physicalists and Schlick and other occasional participants,\nsee, e.g., the differently centered accounts of Uebel 1992, 2007,\nOberdan 1993, Cirera 1994.) While all in the Circle thus recognized as\nfutile the attempt to restore certainty to scientific knowledge\nclaims, not all members embraced positions that rejected\nfoundationalism tout court. Clearly, however, attributing\nfoundationalist ambitions to the Circle as a whole constitutes a total\nmisunderstanding of its internal dynamics and historical development,\nif it does not bespeak wilfull ignorance. At most, a foundationalist\nfaction around Schlick can be distinguished from the so-called left\nwing whose members pioneered anti-foundationalism with regard to both\nthe empirical and formal sciences.\n",
