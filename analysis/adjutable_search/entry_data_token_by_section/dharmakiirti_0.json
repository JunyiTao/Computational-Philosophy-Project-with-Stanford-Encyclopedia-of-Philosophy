    "main_text": "Metaphysics\n1. Metaphysics\n\nThe Dign\u0101ga-Dharmak\u012brti school\u2014contrary to certain\nglobally anti-realist Buddhist schools like the\nMadhyamaka\u2014recognizes that there are, indeed must be, some\nentities that are fully real. It is, however, a school that is\nthoroughly nominalist. What is real for them is only the\nparticular (svalak\u1e63a\u1e47a). By contrast, anything\nthat is a universal (s\u0101m\u0101nyalak\u1e63a\u1e47a) is\nunreal; at most it is a customarily recognized fiction needed for\nthought and language. What demarcates the real from the fictional is\nthat the former has causal powers and exists in a purely punctual way,\na new entity each moment. Both Dign\u0101ga and Dharmak\u012brti were,\nin their final positions, followers of the Yog\u0101c\u0101ra\nidealism, although they clearly went to great effort to make their\npositions largely acceptable to proponents of external objects and to\nidealists alike. Indeed in Dharmak\u012brti\u2019s case, most of his\nphilosophy is presented from a point of view in which external objects\n(b\u0101hy\u0101rtha) are (provisionally at least) accepted\nas real. Idealism only enters the picture after verse 194 of the third\nchapter of Pram\u0101\u1e47av\u0101rttika. He certainly does\nhave sophisticated arguments to prove idealism, that is, the view for\nhim that there are no external objects, that \u201ceverything\ncognizable is internal\u201d (antarj\u00f1eyav\u0101da),\n\u201conly mere data\u201d (vij\u00f1aptim\u0101tra),\n [5]\n and that subject (gr\u0101haka) and object\n(gr\u0101hya) are not two distinct entities. Nonetheless, it\nis striking that the main thrust of Dharmak\u012brti\u2019s\nmetaphysics\u2014his nominalism, his proofs of impermanence and his\ncausal theories of properties\u2014is largely unaffected by the\nchoice of external realism or idealism. Similarly for his\nepistemology, philosophy of language and logic, with a few adjustments\nhere and there. Even on matters of solipsism and other minds, the\nchoice of idealism makes little difference for Dharmak\u012brti. In\nthe Sa\u1e43t\u0101n\u0101ntarasiddhi, for example, he goes\nto great length to show that the Yog\u0101c\u0101ra idealist can use\nthe same arguments for other minds\u2013i.e., the argument from\nanalogy\u2014as the Sautr\u0101ntika realist, and just as the realist\ncan avoid solipsism so the idealist supposedly can\n too.[6]\n For our purposes, essentially for simplicity and conciseness, we\nshall treat of Dharmak\u012brti\u2019s philosophy as accepting external\nobjects, with the proviso that most of the same ideas can be\nreinterpreted to conform to idealism. Another way to put it is that\nwe\u2019ll read the Pram\u0101\u1e47av\u0101rttika along the\nbroad lines of what Tibetan siddh\u0101nta (grub\nmtha\u2019) literature terms the \u201cposition common to\nSautr\u0101ntika [external realism] and Cittam\u0101tra\n[idealism]\u201d (mdo sde pa dang sems tsam pa thun mong ba\u2019i\nlugs).\n1.1. Nominalism\n\n\nIt [i.e., the universal present in one instance] does\nnot go [to another], it was not there [before the\ninstances], nor is it there after [them], nor does it have\nparts. [And even when in other places] it does not leave the previous\nlocus. Oh my! It\u2019s just one disaster after another.\n(Pram\u0101\u1e47av\u0101rttika\n I.152)[7]\n\n\nNo doubt the fundamental intuition in Buddhist nominalism, just as in\nother nominalisms, is that universals are occult pseudo-entities that\nshould not be taken seriously by a responsible thinker concerned with\nontology. As the above quotation from\nPram\u0101\u1e47av\u0101rttika shows, Dharmak\u012brti lists\na series of anomalies: they don\u2019t go anywhere, don\u2019t exist before\nor after their instances, they are partless, are in several\nplaces at one time, and so and so on. Such bogusness of\npseudo-entities becomes a recurrent theme in Buddhist Epistemology. A\nlater Indian Buddhist writer, Pa\u1e47\u1e0dit A\u015boka, inspired\nby Dharmak\u012brti and Dign\u0101ga, ridiculed real universals as\nfollows in his S\u0101m\u0101nyad\u016b\u1e63a\u1e47a\n(\u201cRefutation of Universals\u201d):\n\n\nOne can clearly see five fingers in one\u2019s own hand. One who commits\nhimself to a sixth general entity fingerhood, side by side with the\nfive fingers, might as well postulate horns on top of his\n head.[8]\n\n\nThe collection of intuitive anomalies and appeal to seriousness may\nvery well be the most powerful strategies nominalists East and West\nhave, even though their realist adversaries will predictably maintain\nthat they are untouched because universals are not the kind of things\nthat need to be in one place at one time, etc. However, there are\nother considerations for Dharmak\u012brti besides the intuitive ones.\nThere are metaphysical arguments and even an underlying political\nstance behind his nominalism (see\n section 4).\n The recurring Buddhist metaphysical argument against the reality of\nuniversals is that they would be subject to an intractable\n\u201cone-many\u201d problem: the universal, which would be one\nthing, would have to be somehow present in and share the nature of\nseveral different particulars. The problem for Dharmak\u012brti would\nthen be that because the universal would share the multiple natures of\nthe various particulars it, too, would itself have to be many\ndifferent\n things.[9]\n The alternative whereby the universal would be a radically separate\nentity (arth\u0101ntara) from the particulars and remain\nunitary in nature is dismissed as irreconcilable with the obvious fact\nthat we say that several things possess the same property. Buddhists,\nnot surprisingly, have to consecrate considerable attention to the\nNy\u0101ya idea that universals are indeed such radically\nseparate entities but linked to particulars via an inherence\n(sam\u0101v\u0101ya) relation. The counter-arguments in\nPram\u0101\u1e47av\u0101rttika and\nSambandhapar\u012bk\u1e63\u0101 become technical, turning in\npart on the unreality of relations, but again the intuitive Buddhist\nstance is clearly that inherence, like universals, is an occult\nentity, posited ad hoc and without any discernible effects in the\nworld.\n1.2. Reality and momentariness\n\nWhat figures again and again in Dharmak\u012brti\u2019s philosophical\narguments against universals and other pseudo-entities\u2014and is a\nmajor innovation upon Dign\u0101ga\u2014is the principle that what is\nreal must actually affect things and bring about a change. More\nexactly, the criterion for something being real is that it must have\n\u201ccausal powers\u201d (arthakriy\u0101samartha) and\n\u201cperform causal roles\u201d\n (arthakriy\u0101k\u0101ritva).[10]\n And crucially, particulars have such powers and perform such roles\nwhile universals and other pseudo-entities do not.\nPram\u0101\u1e47av\u0101rttika III.3 (with Manorathanandin\u2019s\nadditions in brackets) summarizes his idea:\n\n\nWhatever has causal powers (arthakriy\u0101samartha), that\nreally exists (param\u0101rthasat) in this context [i.e.,\nwhen we examine reality]. Anything else is declared to be [just]\ncustomarily existent (sa\u1e43v\u1e5btisat) [because it is\npractically accepted through mere conceptual fictions]. These two\n[i.e., the real and the customary] are [respectively] particulars and\n universals.[11]\n\n\nThings, properties, powers, whatever they may be, if real and causally\nefficient, must occupy just one location in time (k\u0101la)\nand space (de\u015ba) and have only a singular nature\n(svabh\u0101va), by which Dharmak\u012brti means that nothing\nreal can span, or be present in, several distinct objects over\ndifferent times and places, and possess the many natures of the\nvarious\n particulars.[12]\n This not only rules out \u201chorizontal universals\u201d\n(tiryaglak\u1e63a\u1e47a), like blueness, which would have\nto be present in several blue particulars at one time, but it also\nrules out \u201cvertical universals\u201d\n(\u016brdhvat\u0101lak\u1e63a\u1e47a), or substances\npersisting throughout time, the numerically identical individual that\nwould be present in each time-slice of a\n thing.[13]\n It is only series of qualitatively similar moments that constitute\nwhat we customarily take to be enduring objects, but there is actually\nnothing that remains numerically the same for more than one\ninstant.\n1.3 Two arguments for momentariness\n\nDharmak\u012brti has two arguments for the momentariness\n(k\u1e63a\u1e47ikatva) of all that exists, one quite\nobscure and unconvincing, which he inherited from previous writers\nlike Vasubandhu (5 century C.E.), and the other more\n promising.[14]\n The first argument, which nowadays is commonly known as the\nvin\u0101\u015bitv\u0101num\u0101na, or \u201cthe inference\nof things perishing [spontaneously],\u201d turns on the long-attested\nBuddhist idea that perishing must be of the intrinsic nature of any\nobject. Perishing due to its intrinsic nature, something will always\nperish as soon it\n exists.[15]\n The point is that such moment by moment destruction is spontaneous\n(\u0101kasmika) and is the uncaused real nature of things,\nbecause it cannot be an effect of any cause. The effect of such a\ncause, i.e., the absence of the entity, would have to be a type of\nnon-being (abh\u0101va), and non-being is unreal.\n\nA key underlying principle of the\nvin\u0101\u015bitv\u0101num\u0101na is that negative facts,\nsuch as absences, are not part of the ultimate furniture of the\nworld but are just fictional conceptual constructions, as they\nare devoid of causal powers. Equally, a fiction lacking causal powers\nis not the effect of something else. While it is obviously impossible\nto deny that hammers smash pots, the absence (abh\u0101va) of\nthe pot, i.e., the non-existent pot, is not an effect, just as other\nnon-existent things (abh\u0101va), like horns of rabbits, are\nnot effects of anything either. Hammers and the like are thus not\nactually causes of the pot\u2019s absence but of it turning into potsherds.\nThat idea is perhaps defensible, in that arguably the mere absence of\nsomething\u2014a purely negative fact\u2014might be less real and\nless efficacious than the presence of other\n things.[16]\n Nonetheless, the rest of the argument looks to consist in a number of\nnon-sequiturs going from that difference in efficacy and\nreality between absences and presences to the idea that perishing is\nsomehow the real nature of things, that it must be intrinsic to them,\nand that therefore things must perish spontaneously moment after\nmoment. Let\u2019s grant the Buddhist view that the perishing of x\nis the real property of changing into a new thing, and not just\nx becoming absent. If it is accepted that hammer blows\ndo change pots into potsherds, then why couldn\u2019t someone\nskeptical about the Buddhist\u2019s arguments just take that as\nthe model of how things perish when they do? It does not follow from\nthat model of perishing that a pot could not endure for quite a\nwhile.\n\nThere is, fortunately, a much better argument for intrinsic\nmomentariness than the problematic\nvin\u0101\u015bitv\u0101num\u0101na. This argument is known\nas \u201cthe inference [of things\u2019 momentariness] from the [mere]\nfact of [them] existing\u201d (sattv\u0101num\u0101na), and\nseems to be largely Dharmak\u012brti\u2019s own invention, first developed\nin the second chapter of his\nPram\u0101\u1e47avini\u015bcaya. If anything exists and is a\nspecific thing rather than another, it is because of its causal\nefficacy (arthakriy\u0101), or powers to produce such and\nsuch effects. Thus, the sattv\u0101num\u0101na reasoning,\nconcisely formulated, is that things are impermanent, i.e., are new\nthings moment after moment, because they are always causally efficient\nin some way. (Although not stated, it seems to be presupposed that\nreal things are every moment causing some or another\ndifferent effect. The differences between effects would be subtle ones\nthat often escape our perception.) The key step in the argument is\nthat nothing causes new effects while itself remaining the same.\nDharmak\u012brti, in the opening passages of the\nV\u0101dany\u0101ya, argues that if something were permanent\n(nitya), it would be causally inert as it would neither\nproduce its effects all at once (yaugapadyena) nor serially\n(kramena). Of course, it is the second hypothesis that is the\nmost attractive possibility for an espouser of permanently enduring\nthings: he would hold that a permanent unchanging cause would produce\na series of different effects, not because the cause changes in any\nway, but simply because of the presence of new and different\nsurrounding circumstances.\n\n\nSuppose it said that a permanent thing has successive concomitant\ncircumstances in dependence upon which it brings about a collection of\neffects\n serially.[17]\n\n\nTo this objection, Dharmak\u012brti, and especially the later\ncommentators like \u015a\u0101ntarak\u1e63ita and\nKamala\u015b\u012bla, reply that if a would-be cause remained\nunchanged over time and if it was only the concomitant circumstances\nthat changed, then it would have to be the new circumstances that were\nthe actual cause of the new effects. After all, the permanent thing\nwould be present unchanged both when the new effects are present and\nwhen they are absent. This failure of the co-presence and co-absence\n(anvayavyatireka) conditions for determining cause and effect\nwould show, for Dharmak\u012brti, that the ever-present thing is not\nthe actual cause of the new developments, but that something else is.\nThis is not unreasonable. If an epidemiologist, for example, found\nthat certain factors had been constant for quite some time before the\noutbreak of an infectious disease and remained unchanged at the time\nof the outbreak, he would tend to discount them as being responsible\nfor the epidemic. And if he found that some new powerful factors\nimmediately preceded the outbreak, he most likely would pin the\ncausality on them rather than on what had remained constant all along.\nThe logic in these arguments against permanence can be generalized to\nvarious would-be entities, including notably the non-Buddhist idea of\nthe permanent creator God (\u012b\u015bvara) who remains the\nsame throughout time while supposedly producing a series of\neffects.\n1.4 A causal theory of properties\n\nWe seem to have in Dharmak\u012brti what would nowadays be termed a\ntype of \u201ccausal theory of\n properties.\u201d[18]\n Particulars have causal properties, that is, powers\n(\u015bakti) or \u201cfitness\u201d (yogyat\u0101)\nto produce such and such results, in that they will produce those\nresults when the right \u201ccomplete collections\u201d\n(s\u0101magr\u012b) of circumstances and other properties are\nunited. And what makes any property what it is consists in the\ncontribution it makes to the potential causal behaviour of what has\nit.\n\nThe question then arises in what way particulars have properties or\npowers. It is important to emphasize that for Dharmak\u012brti and\nmany other Buddhists particulars are not separate entities that\nown or have separately existing properties/powers.\nMuch of the argument here in Buddhist Epistemology (and in other\nschools of Buddhism) is essentially an appeal to perceptual evidence\nand common sense: particulars are real and must be objects of\nperception; nobody perceives a particular without its properties, and\nindeed nobody can see a difference between the bearer of the\nproperties and the properties themselves; hence any such distinction\nis unreal. These reasons are also fleshed out into a fundamental\nposition, initially strongly advocated by Dign\u0101ga, that\nsubject-predicate differences in language do not mirror a\ncorresponding difference between substances and properties in reality\n(see\n section 2.2).\n Bare particulars that somehow have properties, or in which properties\nare instantiated, would thus be ruled\n out.[19]\n\nAre the powers themselves particulars or universals? It can be argued\nthat Dharmak\u012brti and his fellow Buddhists are best understood as\ntrope theorists: the powers/properties that make up\nparticulars are themselves particular entities, differing according to\neach location in space and time (see\n section 2.2.2).\n Charles Goodman and others have made a persuasive case that\nproperties (dharma) for \u0100bhidharmika Buddhists are\nindeed tropes, i.e., properties that are particular\u2014a blueness,\na heat, or a hardness specific to one place-time and not common to\nseveral. The Epistemologists\u2019 version of dharmas would be no\nexception in that respect of being particulars rather than\n universals.[20]\n The causal theory, however, does make for some significant\ndifferences from \u0100bhidharmikas. Many important\n\u0100bhidharmikas, i.e., those of the Sarv\u0101stiv\u0101da school,\nregarded dharmas from a complex double perspective: a) their\nintrinsic natures (svabh\u0101va), i.e., what they\nare, and b) their present causal activity\n(k\u0101ritra) along with their capabilities\n(s\u0101marthya) to lead to effects when the appropriate\ncircumstances obtain. The intrinsic natures of dharmas are\ngiven in terms of categorical properties\u2014being blue, being\nsquare, being hard, etc\u2014and are treated like quiddities, what\ndharmas simply are in themselves. The activities and\ncapabilities, on the other hand, are presented in causal terms, e.g.,\ngiving rise to perceptions of blue and square, producing subsequent\nsimilar things, etc. Not surprisingly, there are involved Abhidharma\ndebates on the relationship between the intrinsic natures and causal\nactivities/capabilities, a rather typically evasive\nSarv\u0101stiv\u0101din response (i.e., that of Sa\u1e45ghabhadra)\nbeing that they are neither the same nor\n different.[21]\n The most radical way out of this problem of the relationship between\nthe intrinsic and the causal is to say, as do N\u0101g\u0101rjuna and\nhis M\u0101dhyamika followers, that there cannot really be any\nintrinsic natures at all: if anything had a quiddity intrinsically, as\n\u0100bhidharmikas and others hold, it would absurdly need to have it\ncompletely acausally\u2014nothing could ever cause a thing to be what\nit is intrinsically. A less radical strategy is a causal theory that\nmakes no separation at all between what something is and what\nit does. That is the strategy that Dharmak\u012brti ably\n pursued.[22]\n\nLet us grant that for Dharmak\u012brti particulars are somehow\nidentified with appropriate causal powers. Is it then an essential or\nan accidental feature of a thing x that it will produce\ny under the appropriate conditions, and is it essential or\naccidental to y that it is caused by x? In a causal\ntheory of properties these features are generally taken to be\nessential. To what degree does Dharmak\u012brti subscribe to that? The\npoint needs analysis. On the one hand, Dharmak\u012brti does very\nstrongly advocate a type of connection that seems to be more than an\naccidental feature of things. This is the so-called \u201cconnection\nby essential natures\u201d (svabh\u0101va\u00adpratibandha)\n [23]\n between cause and effect, and this connection will guarantee that\nthere is a \u201cnexus where [the effect] will not be without [the\ncause]\u201d (avin\u0101bh\u0101vaniyama). Arguments\ninvoking this nexus can, for example, be seen in the\nPram\u0101\u1e47av\u0101rttikasvav\u1e5btti\u2019s discussion of\nI.34\u201347. He begins by introducing verse 34 as follows:\n\n\nWell, if observation and non-observation were no basis for knowing the\nco-presence and co-absence [of smoke and fire], how then does one know\nthat smoke does not deviate (na vyabhicarati) from\n fire?[24]\n\n\nDharmak\u012brti then argues that whatever is smoke must have\noriginated from fire in order for it to be smoke\u2014otherwise it\u2019s\njust a smoke-like thing, a pseudo-smoke. And he also says that if\nsomething like a \u201ctermite tower\u201d\n(\u015bakram\u016brdhan) did actually have the causal\nproperties of fire\u2014i.e., the fitness (yogyat\u0101) to\nproduce real smoke\u2014then it indeed would be on fire (see\nDunne 2004, 335\u2013338).\n\nThat said, on the other hand, there certainly is no development of a\nmodal logic of necessity and possibility and talk of possible worlds\nin Dharmak\u012brti, nor in Indian philosophy generally for that\n matter.[25]\n Although Buddhist Epistemologists do often talk of non-existent\nthings, like rabbit\u2019s horns\n(\u015ba\u015bavi\u1e63\u0101\u1e47a), it is far from clear\nthat they would predicate positive properties (say, sharpness) of them\nin such and such possible situations or \u201cworlds.\u201d What\nthen is the force of the \u201cmust\u201d in the smoke-fire cases,\nand more generally when terms have a \u201cnexus\u201d so that one\nwill not be without the other? Words that are typically used in these\nkind of Dharmak\u012brtian discussions are ni\u015bcaya\n(certainty) and avyabhic\u0101ra (not-deviating). Many modern\ninterpreters have used the term \u201cnecessity\u201d in\ninterpreting these and related terms (See e.g., Dunne 2004, ch. 3;\nIwata 2004); this might lead one to think that when F and\nG have a nexus, it is a necessary truth (i.e., true in all\npossible worlds) that for all x, if x is F\nthen x is G. A more likely interpretation, however,\nis that Dharmak\u012brti is dealing with the actual world and that\nthese key terms are to be interpreted epistemically in terms of\njustification: given such and such natural connections between\nF and G, we can be sure that for all\nx, if x is F then x is G.\nTaking ni\u015bcaya in this way, his point would not be about\nmetaphysical necessity throughout worlds but more about justified very\nstrong confidence that a universally quantified material implication\nholds without exception in the actual world because of natures in this\n world.[26]\n1.5 Humean and Dharmak\u012brtian causality\n\nA comparison with Hume may bring the tensions in Dharmak\u012brti\u2019s\nposition into better focus. Hume had famously said in Section 7 of his\nEnquiry Concerning Human Understanding: \u201cWe may define\na cause to be an object followed by another, and where all the\nobjects, similar to the first, are followed by objects similar to the\nsecond.\u201d Causal connections are said to consist in\ncontingent regularities established by observation. What the\nabove-cited passage from the\nPram\u0101\u1e47av\u0101rttikasvav\u1e5btti suggests,\nhowever, is that for Dharmak\u012brti such mere regularities are\nsomehow not enough and that something stronger is at stake: there are\nfeatures \u201cin\u201d the causal relata themselves. Indeed his\ncausal theory of properties allows him to assert that fire, being what\nit is, must cause smoke under the right conditions and that smoke,\nbeing smoke, must be caused by fire. That being said, there\nare also very important passages in Dharmak\u012brti\u2019s works\nwhere he does speak of establishing causality because one observes an\neffect when there is a particular cause and does not observe it when\nthat cause is absent. As in the case of Hume, this too is an\nobservation of regularities and would seem to be fallible, subject to\nexceptions. It is the Indian method of observing successive\nco-presence (anvaya) and co-absence (vyatireka) and\nis a type of induction used throughout Indian philosophy to establish\nconnections between two types of things. Dharmak\u012brti relies on a\nmulti-step procedure that is sometimes explained in terms of a\nthreefold combination of observations (upalabdhi) and\nnon-observations (anupalabdhi) and sometimes in terms of\nfive. Thus we have the so-called \u201ctriple\u201d or\n\u201cfivefold examination\u201d\n(trikapa\u00f1cakacint\u0101) of causality that is\ndeveloped by later Buddhist writers, such as Dharmottara,\nJ\u00f1\u0101na\u015br\u012bmitra and\n Mok\u1e63\u0101karagupta.[27]\n Other provisos are also added in an attempt to rule out certain bogus\ncircumstances that would vitiate the procedure (see e.g., Lasic 1999).\nThe details and problems cannot be taken up here. This method of\nanvaya and vyatireka has been profitably compared\nwith J.S. Mill\u2019s \u201cMethod of Agreement and Difference\u201d to\nestablish causation (see Matilal 1998,17; cf. Tillemans 2004,\n265\u2013269).\n\nSo how are these passages in Dharmak\u012brti and the commentarial\nliterature to be taken? How do his two positions hang together? One\ninterpretation might be to say that Dharmak\u012brti, somewhat\nna\u00efvely, thought he could arrive at a thoroughly\ninfallible inductive procedure by ever more adroit qualifications of\nthe observations and non-observations. Gillon (1991) is an attempt to\nshow that Dharmak\u012brti\u2019s philosophy, in attempting to come up with\nsuch a watertight procedure, ran up against a problem of induction\nthat wouldn\u2019t go away. A more charitable exegesis is to say that his\nphilosophy recognizes that the way we find out through a\nposteriori methods whether or not x and y are\ncausally related is a quite different matter from what causality\nis\u2014the latter, as we had remarked, involves causal\nproperties of things that make them what they are. Thus we might have\nto discover empirically that fire will burn fuel under such and such\nconditions, but nonetheless that property is not one that it could do\nwithout and still be fire. The more sophisticated interpretation of\nDharmak\u012brti would then be that causality between things is a\nmore-than-contingent connection due to the constitutive properties of\nthings in this world, but nonetheless one that is established a\nposteriori. To take a modern analogy in a Kripkean vein, while\nwater must be H2O and whales must be mammals, we discover those facts,\nwhich in some sense could not be otherwise, through empirical\nmethods and fallibly  .\n2. Epistemology and philosophy of language\n\nHere is the basic epistemological stance that Dharmak\u012brti\ninherited from Dign\u0101ga\u2019s Pram\u0101\u1e47asamuccaya.\nJust as there are only two kinds of objects of knowledge, real\nparticulars and fictional universals, there are only two types of\nknowledge, or more exactly \u201csources of knowledge\u201d\n(pram\u0101\u1e47a), viz., \u201cperception\u201d\n(pratyak\u1e63a) and \u201cinference\u201d\n(anum\u0101\u1e47a). Perception is always purely\nnon-conceptual and non-linguistic whereas inference is conceptual,\nlinguistic\n thinking[28]\n that proceeds on the basis of good reasons. Particulars are the\nobjects of perception and universals are the objects of\ninference\u2014one sees specific shapes, colors, but when one thinks\n\u201cred is a color\u201d the subject and predicate terms range\nover several things. Perception has the special status of giving\ndirect access to the real, whereas conceptual thought is, in an\nimportant way, distorted (bhr\u0101nta) because it\n\u201csuperimposes\u201d universals that aren\u2019t actually there in\nthe particulars themselves.\n\nFor Dign\u0101ga (and his successors) this split between perception\nand conceptual thought was part and parcel of a type of\nfoundationalism. Perception is directly causally bound to particulars\nand \u201cfixed\u201d (niyata) by them: its internal\nrepresentation (\u0101k\u0101ra) of the object is causally\ndetermined by, and corresponds to, the particular itself. It is for\nthat reason that perception is the fundamental \u201ccontact\u201d\nwith the world upon which the superstructure of conceptual cognition\nrests; conceptual cognition, on the other hand, is not fixed in this\nway by particulars and can to a large degree think what it will about\nwhatever it chooses. The separation between perception and conceptual\nthinking in Pram\u0101\u1e47asamuccaya is thus radical\nindeed and yields what seems to be a counterintuitive consequence. For\nDign\u0101ga it would seem that one and the same object could never be\nboth perceived and thought about. Non-Buddhist thinkers, such as\nNaiy\u0101yikas and M\u012bm\u0101\u1e43sakas, did not have this\nproblem. They could cheerfully allow that when one person sees a vase\nand another thinks about it, the type of understanding may be\ndifferent but the object is the same in that the conceptual thought\ngrasps a real universal vaseness that inheres in the same particular\nvase that is perceived. But Dign\u0101ga could not go that route as a\nnominalist. For him if the object of thought is vaseness, that object\nis unreal and thus quite different from the real particular vases that\none sees.\n\nTwo problems loom large in Dign\u0101ga\u2019s account: (1) What are the\nnecessary and sufficient conditions of a source of knowledge\n(pram\u0101\u1e47a) and when are we justified in thinking\nthat these conditions are met? (2) Given that only perception has\ndirect access to the real and is causally bound to it, how is it that\nconceptual thought could ever be about real particulars at\nall and be considered a genuine source of knowledge? We\u2019ll take up the\nquestions one by one.\n2.1 Pram\u0101\u1e47as and justification\n\nDign\u0101ga had left the problem of the nature of\npram\u0101\u1e47as largely open, as he did with the issue of\njustification. These matters were left to Dharmak\u012brti, who\ndefines a \u201csource of knowledge\u201d in\nPram\u0101\u1e47av\u0101rttika II.1 as a \u201creliable\n(avisa\u1e43v\u0101din) cognition\n(j\u00f1\u0101na),\u201d by which he means that the\ncognition is right and reliable as a basis for\n action.[29]\n Some commentators, such as Dharmottara, have unpacked\n\u201creliability\u201d as meaning that the cognition leads to one\nobtaining (pr\u0101paka) the object one desires, a position\nwhich, along with passages concerning arthakriy\u0101, might\nseem to reinforce the view of some modern scholars that\nDharmak\u012brti was a pragmatist (see e.g., Powers 1994; Cabezon\n2000; Katsura 1984).\n [30]\n Tillemans (1999, 6\u201312) examines this would-be pragmatism,\nseeing the theory of truth in Dharmak\u012brti as a weak form of\ncorrespondence. The pragmatism is better taken as a pragmatic theory\nof justification rather than truth. We can justifiably affirm that a\ncognition is correct if we can \u201cconfirm causal efficacy\u201d\n(arthakriy\u0101sthiti), by which it is meant that we come to\nunderstand that the object does in fact have the causal powers we\nexpected. We can justifiably conclude, for example, that we saw a vase\nand not some vase-like illusion because after the initial perception\nwe then confirmed that what we saw does really hold water, as we\nexpected and wished (i\u1e63\u1e6da). Note that while most\nsense perceptions are to be confirmed by subsequent perceptions or\ninferences, there is no infinite regress here: some\nperceptions\u2014e.g., those of very familiar objects or of the\ncapacity of such objects to produce effects\u2014need no subsequent\nconfirmation. Logical inference too needs no ulterior confirmation.\nThese are said to be \u201cintrinsically sources of knowledge\u201d\n(svata\u1e25 pr\u0101m\u0101\u1e47ya) and are prima\nfacie reliable in that they will be trusted as knowledge unless\nit is shown that some cause of error is\n present.[31]\n\nIt is important to emphasize, against a simplistic pragmatic\ninterpretation of Dharmak\u012brti\u2019s position, that a reliable\ncognition is not one that just happens to be right and works\nto enable one to obtain what one seeks. It must also be a cognition\nthat came about via a reliable route, i.e., an appropriate causal\npathway or a set of good reasons. Tibetan scholars will emphasize that\nto conceptually know P the knower must herself ascertain\nP (Tib. nges pa = Skt. ni\u015bcaya,\nni\u015bcita) with a pram\u0101\u1e47a, and that this\nascertainment must itself involve antecedent reliable cognitions\n(i.e., perceptual or conceptual pram\u0101\u1e47as) in order\nto be genuine. Thus, for example, one ascertains P\non the basis of good reasons Q, R, etc., whose\ncharacteristics one has ascertained earlier. If, however, one rightly\nthinks P is the case, but did \u201cnot [first] ascertain\nwith a pram\u0101\u1e47a\u201d (tshad mas ma nges\npa) the characteristics of Q, R, this is deemed\nto be, in Geluk (dge lugs) texts, a \u201ctrue presumption\nwhere the [character of the] reason was not determined\u201d (Tib.\nrgyu mtshan gtan la ma phab pa\u2019i yid dpyod), or following the\nSakya (sa skya) thinkers, a mere \u201cdoubt that is in\naccord with the real\u201d (Tib. the tshom don mthun). For\nboth these Tibetan schools, such an understanding of P is not\nitself a pram\u0101\u1e47a. This is a credible account of\nwhat Dharmak\u012brti held. In short, pram\u0101\u1e47as do\nwork out as we wish, but only because they are cognitions that have\nfollowed the requisite reliable route.\n\nBut does this talk of ascertainment then mean that the Buddhist\nEpistemologist adopts an internalist account of epistemic\njustification? Is the Buddhist saying that when you genuinely know\nsomething, you need to know that you know it, i.e., be able to\nestablish to yourself and others that you have the requisite\njustification?\n [32]\n It is not at all clear that Dharmak\u012brti or his Tibetan\ninterpreters were internalists about epistemic justification. Nothing\nin his own talk of \u201cascertainment\u201d clinches an internalist\ninterpretation that the person who infers must also himself access the\nreason and ascertain with a pram\u0101\u1e47a that it does\njustify the inference. When the debater ascertains the characteristics\nof the reason, all this may mean is that a person making an inference\nmust only in fact have followed a number of reliable\nprocedures to initially determine the characteristics of the reason.\nIt need not mean that when one knows something inferentially one must\nalso be aware of the justification basis, i.e., the reason, and know\nthat it does indeed justify the inference.\n\nIt might be retorted that Dharmak\u012brti\u2019s idea of all awareness\nbeing \u201creflexive awareness\u201d (svasa\u1e43vedana)\nshows his internalism. But \u201creflexive\nawareness\u201d\u2014often termed \u201cself-awareness\u201d (even\nthough for Buddhists it is emphatically not an awareness of a\nself and its states)\u2014will not get us all the way to internalism\nabout justification either. Following Williams (1998), Kellner (2010)\nand Arnold (2010), there seem to be to be two basic themes in the\npositions from Dign\u0101ga and Dharmak\u012brti to\n\u015a\u0101ntarak\u1e63ita that all consciousness is\nnon-conceptually reflexive: (1) that the mind perceives such and\nsuch objects as well as how it experiences those objects; it is thus\nnon-conceptually aware of the objective and subjective aspects\n(\u0101k\u0101ra), or appearances\n(\u0101bh\u0101sa), of all its states; (2) that reflexive\nawareness is a condition of sentience: an experience is not just a\nmaterial process (like, say, digestion), but can lead to subsequent\nmemory and conceptualization because it is non-conceptually\n \u201cauto-illuminated.\u201d[33]\n On both versions, however, while someone could be aware that she is\nnow inferring P in reliance upon a reason Q, it is\nhard to see that her simple awareness of processes \u201cgoing on in\nher head\u201d would also mean that she herself would know that or\nwhy the inference was justified. Reflexive awareness is aware of\nwhatever conscious processes are occurring, be they delusions\nor reliable. So, while a person would be aware of the brute fact that\nthoughts were occurring, their credentials are another matter.\n2.2 Aboutness: the theory of apoha\n\nAt the heart of Dign\u0101ga\u2019s and Dharmak\u012brti\u2019s philosophies is\nthe principle that particulars, i.e., what is real, are only properly\ngrasped by perception; the way they are in themselves is thus said to\nbe \u201cineffable\u201d (avyapade\u015bya; Tib. bstan\nbya min), \u201cnot an object of words\u201d\n (\u015babdasy\u0101vi\u1e63aya).[34]\n Now, obviously, we do in some way manage to talk about\nparticulars\u2014otherwise language would be useless in daily life.\nBut why then say that language and thought fail to capture them?\nThe answer is twofold. First of all, grammatical elements, like\nsubject and predicate, qualifier and qualificand, agent and action,\netc., have no corresponding ontological features, as particulars are\nunities admitting no distinctions between possessors of properties\n(dharmin) and properties (dharma). Dharmak\u012brti\nputs the point as follows in Pram\u0101\u1e47av\u0101rttika\nI.61:\n\n\nIn all cases words expressing substances and their properties just\nmake this [conceptual] distinction. Thus there is no difference\nwhatsoever in the [object] to which they\n refer.[35]\n\n\nSecondly, and perhaps more decisively, the kinds or universals that we\nthink and talk about are not features of the particulars themselves\nbut are merely fictions. Of course, the fact that we do use terms like\n\u201ccow\u201d non-arbitrarily may easily lead us to think that the\nterm must have corresponding real \u201cgrounds for its\napplication\u201d (prav\u1e5bttinimitta),\nand that cow particulars themselves are grouped in a natural\nkind due to their common essential properties. But the\nclear upshot of the Buddhist\u2019s nominalist position about universals is\nthat there are no such natural kinds, and that the usage of terms is\nnot explicable by matching up terms with them.\n\nIneffability thus unpacks as a thorough mismatch between\nrepresentations due to thought and language on the one hand and what\nthere is on the other. For Buddhist Epistemologists this mismatch\nmeans that they cannot adopt unnuanced the predominant Brahmanical\napproach of vy\u0101kara\u1e47a, a grammatically oriented\nmetaphysics in which genuine ontological features would be revealed by\nthe features of Sanskrit grammar (such as case and gender accord\nbetween adjectives and nouns, connections between substantives via the\ngenitive case, etc. Much of Dign\u0101ga\u2019s philosophy of language is\nindeed an attempt to account for such Sanskrit grammatical phenomena,\nbut without the realist baggage.) However, it also leads to a larger\nmatter. The problem is that if the real world is composed only of\nparticulars that are ineffable, it becomes difficult to see how\nlanguage could nonetheless somehow refer to real things or ever be\nabout entities in the world. The Buddhist Epistemologists\nare, in effect, to borrow an idea of Donald Davidson (1984),\nsubscribers to a rigid separation between a conceptual scheme\nand a perceptual content free from the scheme\u2019s additions and\ndistortions, and their problem then becomes how to bridge that very\nscheme-content gap so that thought and language are still somehow\nabout reality. To solve this problem of \u201caboutness\u201d\nDign\u0101ga had devised the theory of concepts, i.e., apoha\n(\u201cexclusions\u201d). Dharmak\u012brti reinterpreted this\ntheory, once again, in terms of causal relations. Here are the broad\n outlines.[36]\n2.2.1 Dign\u0101ga\u2019s apoha\n\nLet us speak about two Buddhist approaches to bridge the\nscheme-content gap, \u201ctop-down\u201d, or descriptive, approaches\nand \u201cbottom-up\u201d, or causal, approaches. By\n\u201ctop-down\u201d we shall mean an account which maintains that\nit is because of some specific (and perhaps ingenious) features of the\nfictional proxy, or concept, that it pertains to particular things.\nEven though it does not have the ontological baggage of a real\nuniversal, the fictional proxy determines the reference of the words\nbecause the descriptive content it provides does in some way have its\ncounterpart in the objects. Thus on a top-down approach, the fictional\nstand-in for a universal like \u201cblueness\u201d would behave like\na property, a sense or a meaning, that belongs to the conceptual\nscheme but would nonetheless qualify and serve to pick out the real\nblue particulars in the world. This can be accomplished, according to\nBuddhist Epistemologists, because the fictional proxies are, or can be\nanalyzed to be, \u201cexclusions of what is other\u201d\n(any\u0101poha), a type of double negation which applies to\nparticular patches of blue in the sense that each such patch is\n non-non-blue.[37]\n As Dign\u0101ga had put it in his\nS\u0101m\u0101nyapar\u012bk\u1e63\u0101 (\u201cAnalysis of\nUniversals\u201d):\n\n\nA word talks about entities only as they are qualified by the negation\nof other\n things.[38]\n\n\nIn fact, Dign\u0101ga applied his analysis both to things and to the\nwords that express them: non-non-blue is the universal-qua-object\n(arthas\u0101m\u0101nya) signified by the term\n\u201cblue\u201d, and non-non-\u201cblue\u201d is the\nuniversal-qua-word (\u015babdas\u0101m\u0101nya) that applies\nto particular articulations of the word \u201cblue\u201d. For\nDign\u0101ga, the signified-signifier (v\u0101cyav\u0101caka)\nrelation holds between these two\n quasi-universals.[39]\n\nWhy are they \u201cquasi\u201d and not full-fledged universals? The\nreasoning is not explicit in Dign\u0101ga. However, it can be\nplausibly reconstructed. Buddhist Epistemologists generally subscribed\nto the principle that mere absences of properties are of a lesser\nontological status than positive things. They would stress that\nnegative facts, like x not being blue, heavy, etc., are\nconstituted by our mere interests (i.e., we seek a blue thing at such\nand such a location and come away empty-handed), and are less real\nthan the fact that x causes perceptions of blue, a fact which\nis what it is objectively and independently of interests. It seems\nthat it is this general Buddhist intuition of the unreality of\nabsences upon which Dign\u0101ga relied. As the \u201cexclusion of\nwhat is other\u201d is itself only a negative property/absence of\nsomething rather than a presence, we are spared commitment to there\nbeing real universals in addition to real particulars.\n\nDign\u0101ga\u2019s approach in the fifth chapter of\nPram\u0101\u1e47asamuccaya is indeed top-down in that he\nrelies upon the descriptive content of the apoha to pick out\nthe appropriate particulars. And top-down is also how the\n\u201cexclusion theory\u201d (apohav\u0101da) is presented\nin the works of non-Buddhist opponents of Dign\u0101ga, as well as in\nmodern works treating of the subject. Bimal K. Matilal interpreted the\ntheory in this fashion (see Matilal 1971, 41), as did Hans Herzberger.\nHerzberger (1975), developed an ingenious logical strategy, using some\npossibilities offered by Emil Post\u2019s theory of twofold propositions,\nto come up with what he termed a \u201cresourceful nominalism,\u201d\none that would explain how predicates applied non-arbitrarily to\nindividual things, that would account for our na\u00efve semantic\nintuitions, and that would nonetheless avoid ontological commitment to\nuniversals. Every proposition would be analyzable as an ordered pair\nof content and commitment\u2014\u201capohist double negation\u201d\nwould affirm content but deny ontological commitment. In what seems to\nbe at least partially a top-down approach, Mark Siderits has taken the\nrelevant double negation as involving two different types of negation,\nchoice and exclusion, so that it is the combination of the two that\npicks out a class of individuals, all the while staying\nnominalistically unengaged to universals (Siderits 1995; 2005).\nFinally, perhaps the most striking modern use of a comparable double\nnegation\u2014i.e., difference from others\u2014 is\nthe view in the Cours de linguistique\ng\u00e9n\u00e9rale of Ferdinand de Saussure\nthat word-types and phonemes are only characterized by their\ndifferences from other ones in a system, although this\n19th\u201320th century Swiss structuralist was\nneither aware of possible 6th century parallels in Indian\nphilosophy nor motivated primarily by nominalist ontological\nworries (see D\u2019Ottavi 2010).\n\nIt remains far from clear, however, how genuine nominalist mileage is\nto be gained on a top-down approach, ingenious as it may be. The usual\ncharge against it by non-Buddhist critics, like Kum\u0101rila and\nUddyotakara, is circularity: if an understanding of blue is to be\nanalyzed as an understanding of non-non-blue and any negation\npresupposes understanding the negandum, then understanding what\nnon-non-blue is would depend on understanding blue\u2014we go round\nin circles. Hugon (2011) gives Dharmak\u012brti\u2019s response to that\ncharge, which consists essentially of a tu quoque\nargument\u2014one needs to understand what a term excludes as much as\nwhat it applies to. Hale (2011) reformulates the difficulty as being\nthat the Buddhist seems to run counter to the compositionality of\nlanguage; he argues that the non-Buddhist criticism will thus remain.\nThe problem is discussed intensely by Indo-Tibetan thinkers, like\n\u015a\u0101ntarak\u1e63ita (for further discussion, see the entry on\n \u015a\u0101ntarak\u1e63ita)\n and Sa skya Pa\u1e47\u1e0dita (see Hugon 2008, 479\u2013485,\n205\u2013210). What is striking is that while it can certainly be\nargued\u2014as these thinkers do\u2014that a meaningful term\npresents both a class of things to which it applies and another to\nwhich it does not apply, it is difficult to see how the latter would\nor should occupy a privileged place. Why would we understand words\nfirst and foremost by the via negativa?\n2.2.2 Dharmak\u012brti\u2019s causal version of apoha\n\nOn a bottom-up approach, on the other hand, the double exclusion plays\na comparatively minor role, and thus some of the\nKum\u0101rila-Uddyotakara criticisms may be less telling. Causal\nchains and error are what serve to bridge the scheme-content gap,\nrather than the descriptive content of the apoha. It is\nnotable that such reliance on causality seems to be entirely absent in\nDign\u0101ga: it is Dharmak\u012brti\u2019s major contribution to the\ntheory. The way words link to things is thus primarily explained\nthrough the existence of a causal chain from particular things to\nperceptions to thoughts and to the utterances of words\u2014in short\nwe have a type of causal theory of\n reference.[40]\n While modern day causal theories of reference\u2014such as that of\nSaul Kripke\u2014are typically used to explain how proper names can\nrefer without descriptive content, the theory can be extended in\nvarious ways to kind terms. Such is the move of Hilary Putnam who\nemphasized that descriptive content, or at its simplest just\n\u201cwhat is in one\u2019s head,\u201d is not enough to distinguish\nbetween seemingly similar kinds. Dharmak\u012brti\u2019s causal theory too\nis not restricted to the reference of proper names, but also seeks to\nexplain causally reference to kinds of things. The causal connection\nis needed to guarantee \u201ccontact\u201d with the world, i.e.,\nthat language ultimately must rest upon perception, which is\nnon-abitrary in that it is \u201cfixed\u201d by things.\nDharmak\u012brti thus explains how an individual (to be called\n\u201cJones\u201d) can think about and refer to such and such an\nobject in the world through a complex and long causal chain from the\nparticular objects to the mental invention of a quasi-universal and\nthe use of a word on a specific occasion. Thoughts and talk of blue\nare thus about blue things because only blue things play the\nappropriate causal role in leading to the thought and finally the\n word.[41]\n\nHere are the bare bones of the causal account as we find it in the\nPram\u0101\u1e47av\u0101rttika: Jones sees particular blue\nthings and they cause perceptual images (\u0101k\u0101ra) in\nhis mind; these images (and often other factors, like longstanding\nhabits) cause him to make the \u201csame judgment\u201d\n(ekapratyavamar\u015ba), \u201cThis is blue,\u201d a\njudgment to which appears an apoha, i.e., a generic\nrepresentation of non-non-blue. Because the particular perceptual\nimages all have the same effect in leading to the same judgment\n\u201cThis is blue\u201d, they all therefore share a key causal\npower and are grouped together. The judgments and resulting use of\nwords are about blue things, and not red things, precisely because\nthere is a causal chain from blue particulars and there isn\u2019t one from\nred\n particulars.[42]\n\nSo much for causal connections replacing real universals to group\nentities. How then do words refer to grouped entities via a causal\nchain? And how does the causal chain get passed on over time in a\ncommunity of speakers? It looks like we have something much like the\ntwo-fold process of reference-fixing and reference-borrowing that\nfigure in causal theories of\n reference.[43]\n\nThe initial reference-fixing is done \u201cat the time of\n[establishing] the linguistic convention\u201d\n (sa\u1e43ketak\u0101le)[44]\n by dubbing a sample case with the words, \u201cThis is blue\u201d.\nThis dubbing is a purely causal event not dependent on any descriptive\ncontent. It is an arbitrary choice, or speech-intention\n(vivak\u1e63\u0101), of the dubber to designate a blue\nsample with the term \u201cblue\u201d rather than\n another.[45]\n Other things will then also be grouped together under\n\u201cblue\u201d by the combination of perception and judgment\ndescribed above. This initial reference-fixing is then preserved in a\ncommonly respected convention that transmits the original intention\nand dubbing from speaker to\n speaker.[46]\n Subsequently \u201cat the time of using [language]\nconventions\u201d (vyavah\u0101rak\u0101le) other speakers\nwill rely on their previous habits, or \u201cimprints\u201d\n(v\u0101san\u0101), and the earlier reference-fixing that is\nnow a well-established convention in the community. Although speakers\ncould in principle use the word \u201cblue\u201d to refer to, say,\nthe colour of chocolate, practical considerations generally mean that\nthey won\u2019t: if someone wishes to tap into the causal chain transmitted\nfrom the initial dubbing, she will use \u201cblue\u201d for blue\nthings exclusively.\n\nDharmak\u012brti\u2019s version of the apoha theory is developed\nin long sections in several chapters of\nPram\u0101\u1e47av\u0101rttika. No doubt, many questions\nneed a fuller treatment. Here are two of the main ones. (1) Given that\nthis is a causal rather than descriptive account of aboutness, what\nrole remains for the apoha, i.e., the double negations upon\nwhich Dign\u0101ga had placed so much emphasis? (2) Wouldn\u2019t having\nthe same powers to produce such and such a judgment depend on having\nsome common universals, or even itself be a common universal, and thus\nforce us to reinstate realism?\n\n(1)\nDharmak\u012brti and his commentators constantly account for the\nmental content of thought in terms of generic representations that are\n\u201cexclusions of what is other\u201d (any\u0101poha),\nthis from the \u201ctime of [establishing] the linguistic\nconvention\u201d (sa\u1e43ketak\u0101la) to the \u201ctime\nwhen one uses the convention\u201d\n(vyavah\u0101rak\u0101la). But if aboutness is indeed assured\ncausally, what is the theoretical interest of any\u0101poha?\nEither Dharmak\u012brti\u2019s theory of reference is not purely causal,\nbut is a hybrid theory involving both causal and descriptive\n elements,[47]\n or any\u0101poha is not there in Dharmak\u012brti\u2019s theory\nto assure aboutness/reference but is his response to another type of\nconcern. Although there certainly are modern hybrid theories of\nreference combining the causal and the descriptive, it is not clear\nhow (or if) Dharmak\u012brti proposes to do that. What seems more\nlikely following\nPram\u0101\u1e47av\u0101rttikasvav\u1e5btti ad 68\u201375\nand ad 128 (see Dunne 2004, 134\u2013136 and 339\u2013352) is that\nany\u0101poha is there in the theory essentially to answer\nmetaphysical worries. Granted that we think that the mental content,\ni.e., the generic representation, has a distribution (anvaya)\nover several instances, is it genuinely distinct from or the same as\nthe instances? In the former case, it would not apply to them; in the\nlatter case it would itself be a particular and unable to apply to\nother particulars. The postulate of any\u0101poha is designed\nto avoid that dilemma of a quasi-universal being the same or\ndifferent\u2014it is neither as it unreal. As Dunne (2004, 136) puts\nit: \u201c\u2026by relegating distribution to a negation,\nDharmak\u012brti blocks any attempt at raising distribution (or a\ndistributed entity) to the level of ultimate reality.\u201d\n(2)\nThat multiple particulars all have the same power to produce the\nsame judgment is not, for Dharmak\u012brti, itself based on any\nunderlying same intrinsic features that would explain why this is so.\nIn Pram\u0101\u1e47av\u0101rttika III.73\u201374 he cites a\nfamous example of different plants that all have the capacity to\nalleviate fever, but where one cannot point out any features in common\nthat would account for the fact that all the various plants work as\nfebrifuges. Similarly for particulars all causing the same judgment:\nthere is no common property that would explain why this\n happens.[48]\n But can\u2019t one say that all of them having that capacity just\nis possession of a common universal, i.e. having the power to\nproduce the same judgment? Lacking that common universal-feature, how\ncould we judge that the particulars have the same power? This argument\nshould seem d\u00e9j\u00e0 vu for the nominalist. We\u2019ve\ncome full circle back to realist\u2019s basic worry: how could we group\nthings without there being some real universal in common?\nDharmak\u012brti\u2019s response is to say that in fact particulars don\u2019t\nreally possess a common power, if one means by that a power that would\nitself be a universal. The powers themselves are all particulars and\ndiffer from each other\u2014the way one plant works is not the way\nthe other works to cure fever and the way one blue particular causes\nthe judgment \u201cThis is blue\u201d differs from the way another\ndoes. These multiple ways exhibit no intrinsic properties in common\nthat would explain why they all work to produce a desired common\neffect. At most there is just the negative grouping of being distinct\nfrom everything which lacks the power, and that, as we know by now, is\nan apoha and not a real property.\n\n3. Logic and Philosophy of logic\n\nThe way the Dign\u0101ga-Dharmak\u012brti school represent the mental\nprocess of reasoning is that one thinks: \u201cA is\nB because of being C, like D.\u201d More\nspecifically, one invokes a logical reason C to prove the\ntruth of the conclusion A is B; the example\nD, which is actually sometimes omitted, is a commonly\nacknowledged case of B-ness and C-ness that permits\nan individual to understand that all Cs are indeed\nBs. The latter generalization is known as\n\u201cpervasion\u201d (vy\u0101pti; Tibetan khyab\npa) of C by B\u2014a universally generalized\nmaterial implication, for all x: if x is C then x is B, with\nthe interesting feature that the quantification ranges over both\nactual and non-actual items. (The indispensability or dispensability\nof the example for one to ascertain/establish the pervasion becomes a\nhotly debated topic amongst later\n theoreticians.[49])\n\nThere is also an important variant where the truth of\n\u201cA is B\u201d is not being established, but\nonly the fact that it would follow from an acceptance\n(abhyupagama) of A being C. Thus a debater\ncan present an opponent with a prasa\u1e45ga (consequence)\nof the sort: \u201cIt would follow absurdly that A would be\nB, because of being C.\u201d Such a consequence\nwill constitute the key step in a proof by reductio ad absurdum, a\nproof that will culminate in a type of contraposition, turning on\nmodus tollens. When the pervasion in the consequence holds\nand the opponent understands that A is not in fact\nB, the opponent will then be led by a \u201ccontraposition\nof the consequence\u201d (prasa\u1e45gaviparyaya, literally\n\u201creversing the consequence\u201d) to understand that A\nis not in fact C because of not being B. Both these\nstructures, i.e., proofs by logical reasons and consequences, are to\nbe found in Indian and Tibetan writing on a variety of subjects.\n3.1 Good reasons and the triple criterion\n\nSince T. Stcherbatsky\u2019s two volume study and translation of\nDharmak\u012brti\u2019s Ny\u0101yabindu, entitled Buddhist\nLogic (i.e., Stcherbatsky 1930/32), one often sees the Buddhist\ntheory of reasons/indices designated as \u201clogic,\u201d a term\nthat sometimes has the unwanted effect of leading readers to think\nthat good reasons for Buddhists are simply those that are formally\nvalid. In fact, the notion of formal validity (i.e., the conclusion\u2019s\nbeing guaranteed true, provided the premises are true) is not\nitself explicitly discussed by Buddhist\ntheoreticians; it is in any case not distinguished from other, more\ninformal, considerations. Instead of formally valid reasons, Buddhist\ntheoreticians developed the notion of a good reason\n(saddhetu, Tibetan rtags yang dag), i.e., one which\nsatisfies a triple criterion (trair\u016bpya). These three\ncriteria for \u201cgoodness\u201d are given in the following fashion\nfrom Dharmak\u012brti on:\n\npak\u1e63adharmatva (the logical reason\u2019s being a\nproperty of the subject): the subject A is ascertained\n(ni\u015bcita) as having the property C;\nanvayavy\u0101pti (pervasion [that is formulated] as\nco-presence ): C is ascertained as present in only instances\nthat are similar (sapak\u1e63a) to A insofar as\nthey possess B;\nvyatirekavy\u0101pti (pervasion [formulated] as\nco-absence): C is ascertained as wholly absent from instances\ndissimilar (vipak\u1e63a) to A insofar as they do\nnot possess\n B.[50]\n\n\nTrue, in texts like the Hetucakra of Dign\u0101ga (which was\ntaken up in detail by Dharmak\u012brti in\nPram\u0101\u1e47av\u0101rttika IV and\nPram\u0101\u1e47avini\u015bcaya III), a version of the\ntriple criterion (trair\u016bpya) for good reasons and the\noperators \u201cpartial presence,\u201d \u201ccomplete\npresence,\u201d and \u201ccomplete absence\u201d were correlated to\nyield a series of nine types of reasons, types that are\nabstracted from content and subject matter. Not inappropriately, the\ngreat historian of logic, Innocentius Boche\u0144ski, in the chapter\non Indian Logic in his History of Formal Logic, stated that\nthe Hetucakra thus suggested an awareness of formal\nconsiderations. R.S.Y. Chi, in his Buddhist Formal Logic (Chi\n1984), went several steps further and attempted to show that the\nHetucakra, taken in its formal aspects, might present a\nnumber of interesting features to a modern logician. That being said,\nthere is certainly much more to \u201cgood reasons\u201d satisfying\nDharmak\u012brti\u2019s triple criterion than simple formal validity. The\nterm \u201cascertained\u201d (ni\u015bcita), when unpacked\nby Dharmak\u012brti and his commentators, demands that good reasons\nmust be sound (i.e., the premises must in fact be true and the\nconclusion must follow from them), that their three characteristics\nmust be ascertained, and that the opponent have the appropriate\n\u201cdesire to know\u201d (jij\u00f1\u0101s\u0101)\nsomething new that he does not already know. This latter demand leads\nto a host of other requirements: in order to be convinced of something\nnew the opponent must have the requisite doubt, understand the terms\nand accept the subject of debate. In short, good reasons involve\nformal considerations (what follows from what?); factual\nconsiderations (what is so? what is true?); epistemic considerations\n(what needs to be known in order for people to genuinely know\nsomething else? when is doubt possible?); and what can be termed\n\u201crhetorical considerations\u201d (what is newly convincing to\nwhom? when does the debate have a point and when does it fall flat?).\nThe weighting of these aspects in the theory of the \u201ctriple\ncriterion\u201d changes over history in complex fashions. At certain\npoints what were factual matters become epistemic matters, and this\neven leads to interesting reorientations of the triple\n criterion.[51]\n3.2 Inference-for-others\n\nLater theoretical elaborations by Dign\u0101ga, Dharmak\u012brti, et\nal. about how to present publicly (i.e., verbally) a good\nreason (saddhetu) to an adversary in a debate prescribe the\nuse of complex verbal forms known as prayoga (formal\nreasonings). Thus, for example, the standard formal reasoning that\nDharmak\u012brti and his Indo-Tibetan successors prescribed\nwas a two-membered form, known as an\n\u201cinference-for-others\u201d\n(par\u0101rth\u0101num\u0101na):\n\n\nAll Cs are Bs, like D.\n\nA is C.\n\n\nCommentators make an explicit correlation with the triple criterion\n(trair\u016bpya). Thus the first statement perspicuously\nexpresses the pervasion (i.e., the anvayavy\u0101pti and\nvyatirekavy\u0101pti) and the second expresses the fact of\nthe reason being a property of the subject\n(pak\u1e63adharmatva). The statement of the conclusion,\nA is B, is omitted. Indeed it is explicitly ruled\nout in later prescriptive accounts of how Buddhists should argue.\nDharmak\u012brti\u2019s own position on this hardens over time to arrive,\nin the V\u0101dany\u0101ya, at the view that stating the\nconclusion is actually a \u201cpoint of defeat\u201d\n(nigrahasth\u0101na). The irrelevance of the conclusion is\nsupposedly because the only function of an inference-for-others is to\nshow \u201cprovers\u201d (s\u0101dhana), and a conclusion\ncannot prove itself. Although A is B, i.e.,\n\u201cwhat is to be proved\u201d (s\u0101dhya), can be\nunderstood indirectly, it should not be stated. While the\ninference-for-others has often been thought to somehow formally\nresemble a syllogism in Aristotelian logic, it is apparent that the\npresence and absence of conclusions in syllogisms and\ninferences-for-others respectively as well as the idea of what\nconstitutes a \u201cprover\u201d for Buddhists, means that\npar\u0101rth\u0101num\u0101na and Aristotelian syllogisms are\naccounted for in terms of considerably different philosophies of logic\n(see Tillemans 1999, 69\u201387).\n3.3 Opaque contexts\n\nWhile provers (s\u0101dhana), i.e., logical reasons and\nexamples, can of course be expressed in words, as in a\n\u201cpublic\u201d inference-for-others, they are not themselves\nwords. Although Dharmak\u012brti et al. speak in terms of one\nstate of affairs, or one entity (artha), proving another, in\nfact the picture has all the complex features of the scheme-content\ngap and its bridges: logical reasoning is a mental process that\ndirectly treats of fictional proxies, i.e., concepts, which are in\nturn connected in apoha-fashion to real particular entities.\nNot surprisingly, the idea that provers are apoha-properties\nrather than words has its philosophical complexities. When do we have\nthe same property and when do they differ? When a pervasion is\nbidirectional, or \"equal\" (samavy\u0101pti), as in the case\nof being impermanent (anityatva) and being produced\n(k\u1e5btakatva), it\u2019s quite easy to see that the\nimpermanent particulars will be identical with the produced\nparticulars. Given that the bidirectional pervasion analyzes as\n\u201cfor all x, x is produced if and only if\nx is impermanent\u201d, the extension of the two concepts\n(i.e., the set of impermanent particulars and the set of produced\nparticulars) is the same for Buddhists. Nonetheless, substitutivity of\none term for the other would seem to lead to an invalid inference\nwhere the premises are true but the conclusion is not. To bring out\nthe problem, take the following tempting, but invalid, inference:\n\n\n\n\nBeing a product is a good reason for proving that sound is\nimpermanent. \n\nBeing a\nproduct is coextensive with being impermanent (i.e., for all\nx: x is a product if and only if x is\nimpermanent). \n\nTherefore, being impermanent is a good reason for proving that\nsound is impermanent.  \n\n\n\nWe go from two true premises to a false conclusion, for it is clear\nthat for a Buddhist (as for most people) arguing that something is so\nsimply because it is so is not giving a good reason. And yet\nit might also be thought that the move from premises to conclusion is\nan acceptable application of the principle of substitutivity of\nidenticals for identicals salva veritate. What went\nwrong?\n\nDharmak\u012brti, in Pram\u0101\u1e47av\u0101rttika I verse\n40 et sq. and Svav\u1e5btti, diagnosed the problem as one of\nbidirectional pervasions (i.e., coextensive concepts) seeming to force\nus to accept pratij\u00f1\u0101rthaikade\u015bahetu\n\u201creasons that are one part of the thesis\u201d (e.g., when one\nsays \u201csound is impermanent because it is impermanent,\u201d\nthen the reason \u201cbeing impermanent\u201d is also a part of the\nthesis that is being proved). He saw this undesirable consequence as\none of the main challenges to logical thought, i.e.,\n\u201cinference,\u201d being a source of knowledge\n(pram\u0101\u1e47a), for unless one can somehow rule out the\nproblematic substitutions in what I have called the \u201ctempting\ninference,\u201d we would be saddled with having to accept as good a\nhuge number of singularly uninformative reasons.\n\nThe problem is recognizably the familiar one of substitutivity in\nreferentially opaque contexts, such as propositional attitudes and\nmodal\n contexts.[52]\n Talk of good reasons being ones where the debater has a desire to\nknow P but not an equivalent Q is indeed an opaque\ncontext. To analyse what goes wrong in the tempting inference,\nDharmak\u012brti, in effect, made a recognizable move by\ndistinguishing between types of identities: \u201cbeing\nimpermanent\u201d and \u201cbeing produced\u201d are extensionally\nidentical, but somehow not intensionally so\u2014what he terms being\nthe same concept, i.e., exclusion (apoha;\nvy\u0101v\u1e5btti). And in the opaque context substitution\nshould only be made between conceptually identical terms.\n\nIn fact, though, it could be said that the usual idea of an\nintensional identity (one that is understood to hold between\nproperties F and G when the biconditional for\nall x: x is F if and only if x is G is true in all possible\nworlds) will not get us very far out of the woods, as being\nimpermanent and being produced are arguably identical in that\nway, and it would thus seem that if that is what conceptual\nidentity is about for a Buddhist Epistemologist it should be\npossible to make the substitution in the opaque contexts under\ndiscussion. Dharmak\u012brti\u2019s idea of concepts F and\nG being identical thus demands a much stronger criterion than\nthe necessary truth of the biconditional for all x: x is F iff x\nis G. In his Svav\u1e5btti ad verse 40 and in\nconsiderable detail in the Tibetan Geluk (dge lugs)\n\u201cCollected Topics\u201d (bsdus grwa) literature and\ncommentaries on Pram\u0101\u1e47av\u0101rttika, we find the\nmakings of an idea of \u201cconceptual identity/difference\u201d\n(Tibetan ldog pa gcig/tha dad) such that to each meaningful\nsubject or predicate term in a language there is a different\nconcept\u2014synonyms, for example, will express different concepts.\nInterestingly enough, although this individuation of\nexclusions/concepts might seem to lead to an undesirable proliferation\nof strange ultra-intensional entities, at least certain\nEpistemologists\u2014e.g., \u015a\u0101ntarak\u1e63ita,\nKamala\u015b\u012bla and very clearly the twelfth-thirteenth century\nTibetan Sa skya Pa\u1e47\u1e0dita (in the first chapter of his\nTshad ma rigs gter)\u2014emphasized that concepts were just\nfictions, fa\u00e7ons de parler for different states of\nmind, and even that concepts were not to be reified as any\nkind of object (vi\u1e63aya; Tibetan yul) at all.\nThe states of mind could be individuated unproblematically, and so\nderivatively we could somehow perhaps individuate the concepts too\nwithout committing ourselves to a plethora of occult objects, one for\neach word. It remains to be seen, however, whether shifting the burden\nto states of mind gets us out of the woods or still leaves us with\n\u201csubsistent\u201d entities that should make ontologically\nscrupulous nominalists cringe in horror.\n4. Religion and ethics\n\nFinally, what of the Buddhist religion? While Dharmak\u012brti has\nsometimes been depicted as a dry practitioner of an essentially\nsecular philosophy, this seems hardly defensible. Technical logical\nand epistemological discussions on sources of knowledge were not just\npursued for their own sake. They were also used to establish Buddhist\nreligious doctrines, like the Four Noble Truths, the proofs of the\nBuddha being an authoritative/reliable person\n(pram\u0101\u1e47apuru\u1e63a, Tibetan tshad ma\u2019i skyes\nbu), the law of retribution of acts (karman),\nreincarnation, compassion, omniscience, the innate Buddha-nature,\nabsence of real personal identity,\n etc.[53]\n All these topics are treated in extenso in the second\nchapter of Pram\u0101\u1e47av\u0101rttika, and some form the\nsubject of independent treatises by later Epistemologists. There is\nalso a concern with direct perception of religious truths and the\nmethods leading to that extraordinary type of knowledge. In the third\nchapter of Pram\u0101\u1e47av\u0101rttika and in the\nperception chapters of the Ny\u0101yabindu and\nPram\u0101\u1e47avini\u015bcaya, for example,\nDharmak\u012brti seeks to explain and rationalize the perception of a\nyogin (yogipratyak\u1e63a). He advocates a quite remarkable\nmethod of meditation\u2014more literally \u201ccultivation\u201d\n(bh\u0101van\u0101; abhy\u0101sa)\u2014in which\nphilosophical analysis plays an indispensable role (see e.g., Taber\n2009; see Tillemans 2016, chapter 10, on Dharmak\u012brti-style\nmeditation, its epistemological challenges and the contrast with Chan\nBuddhist approaches).\n\nThe whys and wherefores of Dharmak\u012brti\u2019s philosophy of religion\nare no doubt partly explained by the historical context in which he\nlived, one in which Buddhist institutions and power were confronted\nwith forceful challenges of a reinvigorated\n Brahmanism.[54]\n Indeed, not just on matters of Buddhist doctrine but also on many\nmetaphysical issues was there a religious dimension to his arguments.\nIn the latter half of the first chapter of\nPram\u0101\u1e47av\u0101rttika, Dharmak\u012brti proceeds to\na detailed attack on the authority of the Vedas, the Brahmins that\nexpound them, the Brahmanical ideas about the efficacy of mantras, and\nthe system of caste (see Eltschinger 2000). It is noteworthy that a\nfrequent Sanskrit term for \u201cuniversal\u201d,\n\u201ckind\u201d, i.e., j\u0101ti, is also the term for\n\u201ccaste.\u201d As Eltschinger (2000) shows, the discussions on\nthe unreality of universals and the unreality of caste were related\nfor Dharmak\u012brti and were explicitly taken to be related by\ncommentators like \u015a\u0101kyabuddhi and Kar\u1e47akagomin. Castes\nwere natural kinds explainable through universals for non-Buddhists,\nand they were not arbitrary or man-made customary distinctions. An\nobvious pay-off of Dharmak\u012brti\u2019s nominalism, then, was that\nBuddhists could further distance themselves from Brahmanical\nprinciples of social organization and ethics by attacking the\nmetaphysical foundations of caste.\n\nThe debate with Brahmanical schools on specific doctrinal questions\nnaturally moved to long and involved discussions on issues of\nscriptural authority, such as the M\u012bm\u0101\u1e43saka school\u2019s\njustification of the Vedas as being eternal, uncreated by\nhumans (apauru\u1e63eya) and hence authoritative because\nfree from any human influence. (The Buddhist retort is essentially\nthat if per impossibile scriptures were uncreated, they would\nbe incomprehensible, for there would be no speakers\u2019 intentions to\nmean one thing rather than another in using a specific\nword.) On the role of scripture Dharmak\u012brti actually had a\nnuanced position. In Pram\u0101\u1e47av\u0101rttika\nI.213\u2013217 et sq. and in IV.48\u2013108 he maintains that\nscripture shouldn\u2019t be used on factual or rationally decidable\nmatters; perception and logical reasoning trump the scriptures of\none\u2019s own school; one is not to be faulted for rejecting one\u2019s\nschool\u2019s scriptures when reason dictates it; on rationally undecidable\nmatters, however, that is on so-called \u201cradically inaccessible\nthings\u201d (atyantaparok\u1e63a), like the specific\ndetails of the law of karman (exactly what actions in past\nlives lead to what results in the future?), scriptural accounts need\nto be relied upon because of the absence of any other means\n(agaty\u0101) (I.216). Scripture, if it passes certain\nconditions, can be designated as being an inferential source of\nknowledge, but is always fallible and not to be considered a\nfull-fledged source of knowledge, as \u201cit has no claim to\ncertainty\u201d (n\u0101to ni\u015bcaya\u1e25), unlike bona\nfide inferences (Svav\u1e5btti ad I.318). The eighth century\ncommentator \u015a\u0101kyabuddhi summarizes things interestingly in\nhis commentary to I.216: scripture is simply needed by (indeed,\nindispensable to) those who wish to set out upon the spiritual path\n(prav\u1e5bttik\u0101ma), but it is not grounded in any\nobjective facts (vastutas) (Tillemans 1999, ch. 2).\n\nThis is a surprisingly fallibilist and pragmatic position for a deeply\nreligious thinker. Taken further, it would have major consequences for\nBuddhist ethics. The use of appeals to \u201cradically\ninaccessible\u201d facts to justify ethical positions was recognized\nby Dharmak\u012brti to be flawed in public debate. Indeed he seems to\nhave been quite aware that invoking such purely scriptural positions\nwould fall flat outside the context of convinced\n Buddhists.[55]\n The lesson could have been that Buddhists should genuinely privilege\nrational considerations debatable by all, rather than heavily\nweighting \u201cproofs\u201d that were for the faithful.\nUnfortunately, however, over history the later Indo-Tibetan Buddhist\nscholastic apologists transformed the Dharmak\u012brtian view on\nscripture, indeed all of his religious philosophy, into an\nincreasingly rigid\n edifice.[56]\n Dharmak\u012brti became the defender of the Buddhist\nfaith\u2014the \u201clord of reasoning\u201d (Tib. rigs pa\u2019i\ndbang phyug). It is regrettable that much of the thought of this\nhighly inquisitive and subtle philosopher often became, in later\nIndian and Tibetan Buddhism, a series of unquestioned formulae to\nsecure Buddhist fundamentalism.\n5. Editions and translations of the Pram\u0101\u1e47av\u0101rttika\n\nAn ongoing bibliography of editions and translations of\nDharmak\u012brti\u2019s seven works and those of other major Buddhist\nauthors on epistemology and logic is presented on the site\nEpistemology and Argumentation in South Asia and Tibet\n(www.east.ikga.oeaw.ac.at). Here are what we consider to be principal\neditions and translations of Dharmak\u012brti\u2019s main work, the\nPram\u0101\u1e47av\u0101rttika.\n\nThe Sanskrit and Tibetan texts of the verses of\nPram\u0101\u1e47av\u0101rttika are edited in Miyasaka\n(1971/72). The Sanskrit of the autocommentary\n(Svav\u1e5btti) is edited in Gnoli (1960). Partial\neditions are also found in several of the translations. Chapter I\nand autocommentary are partially translated in several publications:\nI.1\u201310 plus autocommentary is translated into English in Gillon\nand Hayes (1991); I.1\u201351 plus autocommentary are translated into\nEnglish in Mookerjee and Nagasaki (1964). For a German translation of\nChapter I.40\u2013185 plus autocommentary, see Frauwallner (1932;\n1933). Steinkellner (2013) is a German translation\nof various parts of Chapter I and the\nautocommentary that pertain to the theory of logical\nreasons. Eltschinger (2007) gives a French translation of\nI.213\u2013268. Eltschinger, Krasser, and Taber (2012) contains an\nEnglish translation of I.312-340 and the autocommentary.\nEltschinger, Taber, Much, and Rati\u00e9 (2018) is an English\ntranslation of I.40\u201391 and the autocommentary. Dunne (2004)\ngives English translations of I.34\u201337, 68\u201375,\n137\u2013142, 214\u2013223 and autocommentary. Chapter II.1-6\nalong with selections from the commentaries of Devendrabuddhi\nand  \u015a\u0101kyabuddhi are translated in Dunne\n(2004): II.1-7 are translated in van Bijlert\n(1989); II.34-72 along with the commentary of\nPraj\u00f1\u0101karagupta are translated into English in Franco\n(1997);  Vetter (1990) gives a German translation of\nII.131cd-285. Pecchia (2015) contains an English translation of\nII.190\u2013216 and the commentary of Manorathanandin.
