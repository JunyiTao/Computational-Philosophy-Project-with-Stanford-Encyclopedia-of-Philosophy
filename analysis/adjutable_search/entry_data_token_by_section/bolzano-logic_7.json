    "main_text": "The analysis of propositions\n5. The analysis of propositions\n\nIf Bolzano\u2019s thesis of semantic atomism is correct, then there\nis a finest form for every proposition; namely, the one in\nwhich every simple idea in the proposition is considered independently\nvariable. We can see from this the task that confronts someone who\nseeks to define the concept of a proposition as a certain kind of\nstructured whole using formation rules: this would require not only a\nspecification of all possible syntactic structures, but also a\ncomplete set of semantic categories (since different sites of\nvariation may come with different classes of admissible items).\nMoreover, it would be necessary to do this not just for a formal\nlanguage of our own devising, or for a single natural language, but\nfor any possible language. Seen in this light, Bolzano\u2019s\nforthright admission that he could find no satisfactory definition of\nthe concept of a proposition is hardly surprising.\n\nInstead of trying to begin with simple ideas and construct\npropositions from them, Bolzano works from the outside in, trying to\ndistinguish parts within propositions, generally following what Quine\ncalled the \u201cmaxim of shallow analysis\u201d, namely,\n\u201cexpose no more logical structure than seems useful for the\ndeduction or other inquiry at hand\u201d (Quine, 1960: \u00a733;\n160). Since propositions in themselves are causally inert, this cannot\nbe done by inspecting them. Rather, one considers linguistic\nexpressions, drawn from a variety of languages, along with one\u2019s\nown thoughts, and attempts to identify features of logical\nsignificance, bearing in mind that \u201ccommon usage does not aim at\nlogical correctness but rather at brevity and sufficient\ndistinctness.\u201d (TS, \u00a7170 [II.213]; see also\n\u00a7350, 366).\n\nBolzano makes a number of specific proposals concerning the analysis\nof propositions, most of them now of merely historical interest. We\nwill briefly present a few of these here.\n\nFirst, he argues that every proposition belongs to the\nsubject-predicate form \u2018\\(A\\) has \\(b\\)\u2019 (TS,\n\u00a7 127; recall that this does not prevent them from also belonging\nto other forms.) He acknowledges that he has no conclusive argument\nfor his thesis, but claims that he has been able to find acceptable\nsubject-predicate paraphrases of all the sentence forms that have\noccurred to him (Bolzano 1843: 48).\n\nIn true propositions of this form, the place marked by\n\u2018\\(A\\)\u2019 is occupied by an idea that has one or more\nobjects, while the place marked by \u2018\\(b\\)\u2019 is occupied by\nan idea representing one or more attributes. The copula, expressed by\n\u2018has\u2019, understood to be without tense or number, indicates\nthe possession of an attribute. Tense is dealt with by adding temporal\ndeterminers to the subject-idea. For example, \u2018Smith is in\npain\u2019 would be more distinctly expressed as \u2018Smith at the\npresent moment\u2013has (tenselessly)\u2013pain\u2019 (\u00a7127,\nno. 5).\n\nSince both the subject- and predicate-ideas may be general, we must\nunderstand \u2018\\(A\\) has \\(b\\)\u2019 to convey that every object\nstanding under the idea [\\(A\\)] has an attribute standing under the\nidea [\\(b\\)] (\u00a7131). Accordingly, he takes propositions of the\nform \u2018All \\(A\\) have \\(b\\)\u2019 to be synonymous with those of\nthe forms \u2018Each \\(A\\) has \\(b\\)\u2019 and \u2018\\(A\\) has\n\\(b\\)\u2019, e.g., \u2018All men have mortality\u2019, \u2018Each\nman has mortality\u2019, and \u2018Man has mortality.\u2019\n\nBolzano believes that the subject-predicate form can accommodate\nrelational claims, interpreting them as statements about collections.\nFor instance, a claim that items \\(A, B, C, \\ldots\\) are equal in the\nsense of all having attributes \\(b, b', b'', \\ldots\\) could be\ninterpreted as a claim about a collection containing two unordered\nsub-collections (Mengen), i.e., \\(\\langle (A, B, C, \\ldots),\n(b, b', b'', \\ldots)\\rangle\\), stating that the collection has the\nattribute that every item in the first sub-collection has each of the\nattributes in the second sub-collection (cf. \u00a7135, no.15).\n\nFor Bolzano, truth and falsity (or lack-of-truth) are properties of\npropositions. Given his assumption that all propositions belong to the\nform \u2018\\(A\\) has \\(b\\)\u2019, he is able to offer the following\ndefinition of truth (TS, \u00a728):\n\n\nA proposition is true when it states what belongs to its object. \n That is,\n\n\n\n[A has b] has truth iff A has b. \n\n\nBolzano\u2019s analysis of existential claims such as \u2018There\nare prime numbers greater than 100\u2019 is also noteworthy. What we\nmean in such cases, he says, is that the idea [prime number greater\nthan 100] has objectuality (\u00a7137). This analysis shows its worth\nin the case of true negative existentials such as \u2018Round squares\ndo not exist\u2019, allowing him to solve the associated riddle of\nnon-being. For this sentence says the same as the more distinct\n\u2018[Round square] has lack-of-objectuality\u2019 according to\nBolzano, and, in this case, we have an objectual subject-idea (its\nobject is the idea [round square]) and ascribe to its object\na property that it has (namely, objectlessness) (\u00a7138).\n\nBolzano proposes similar analyses of forms such as \u2018Some \\(A\\)\nare \\(B\\)\u2019 and \u2018No \\(A\\) is \\(B\\)\u2019. These are taken\nto be more distinctly expressed as follows: \u2018[\\(A\\), which has\n\\(b\\)] has objectuality\u2019, and \u2018[\\(A\\), which has \\(b\\)]\nhas non-objectuality\u2019, respectively (\u00a7137,138).\n\nClaims of objectuality are not to be confused with claims of\nactuality (\u00a7142). Though, for example, Bolzano\nmaintained that there are (es gibt) propositions and ideas in\nthemselves, as well as geometrical points and other mathematical\nobjects, he denied at the same time that they had actual existence\n(i.e., they do not act, or enter into causal relations, no spatial or\ntemporal determinations attach to them, etc.). The ideas [proposition\nin itself], [geometrical point], etc., that is, have objectuality but\npropositions, points, etc., lack the property of actuality.\n\nBolzano distinguishes predicate and propositional negation, the former\ntaking the form \u2018\\(A\\) has non-\\(b\\)\u2019, the latter\n\u2018[\\(A\\) has \\(b\\)] has non-truth\u2019 (\u00a7189, 1(e); cf.\n\u00a7136). The two forms are not equivalent, since, for example,\n[Mozart\u2019s 35th piano concerto is not in E-flat] is false, its\nsubject-idea being objectless, while [[Mozart\u2019s 35th piano\nconcerto is in E-flat] has non-truth] is true.\n\nMaterial disjunctions, i.e., claims of the forms \u2018\\(A\\) or \\(B\\)\nor \\(C \\ldots\\)\u2019 are paraphrased as follows (\u00a7181):\n\u2018[True proposition in the collection (\\([A], [B], [C],\n\\ldots\\))] has objectuality\u2019 (inclusive disjunction) or as\n\u2018[True proposition in the collection \\(([A], [B], [C],\n\\ldots\\))] has objectuality and [Plurality of true propositions in the\ncollection (\\([A], [B], [C], \\ldots\\))] has non-objectuality\u2019\n(exclusive disjunction).\n\nWe hope this is enough to give some sense of Bolzano\u2019s approach\nand some of its limitations. More details may be found in the\nsecondary literature.\n",
