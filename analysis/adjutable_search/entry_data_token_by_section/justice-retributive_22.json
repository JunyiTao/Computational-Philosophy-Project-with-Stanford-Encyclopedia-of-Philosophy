    "main_text": "The Question of Justification || Vindicating victims by defeating wrongdoers\n5.3 Vindicating victims by defeating wrongdoers\n\nJean Hampton tried to improve upon the unfair advantage theory by\nfocusing on the idea that what wrongdoers (at least those who have\nvictims) do is an affront to the victim, not just to the\nwhole community. Her view is that punishment must somehow annul this\naffront. As she puts it:\n\n\nIf I have value equal to that of my assailant, then that must be made\nmanifest after I have been victimized. By victimizing me, the\nwrongdoer has declared himself elevated with respect to me, acting as\na superior who is permitted to use me for his purposes. A false moral\nclaim has been made\u2026 The retributivist demands that the false\nclaim be corrected. The lord must be humbled to show that he isn't the\nlord of the victim. \u2026 [R]etributive punishment is the defeat of\nthe wrongdoer at the hands of the victim (either directly or\nindirectly through an agent of the victim's, e.g., the state) that\nsymbolizes the correct relative value of wrongdoer and victim. It is a\nsymbol that is conceptually required to reaffirm a victim's equal\nworth in the face of a challenge to it. (Murphy & Hampton 1988:\n125\u2013126)\n\n\nThis theory too suffers serious problems. First, why think that a\nwrongful act seriously challenges the equal moral standing of all? It\nmay imply that the wrongdoer thinks of himself as above either the law\nin general or his victim in particular. But he's simply mistaken.\nUnless there is a danger that people will believe he is right, it is\nnot clear why there is a pressing need to correct him.\n\nSecond, even if the message is offensive in a way that calls for\ncorrection, why isn't the solution simply to reaffirm the moral status\nof the victim, to censor the wrongdoer, and perhaps to require the\nwrongdoer to make compensation? The answer may be that \u201cactions\nspeak louder than words\u201d. Perhaps some punishment may then be\nnecessary to show that we really mean it when we say that he was\nmistaken. But why wouldn't it be sufficient to inflict \u201cthe\npunishment\u201d\u2014whatever that is\u2014to reinforce the point?\nIt's unclear why the punishment should rise above some baseline-level,\nin proportion with the gravity of the wrong, to show that \u201cwe\nmean it\u201d.\n\nThird, the message of equality through turning the tables seems\npeculiar. If the victim, with the help of others, gets to take her\nturn being lord, it is not clear how that sends the message of\nequality, rather than simply the message that this particular\nwrongdoer lost in the competition to be \u201clord\u201d.\n\nFourth, Hampton seems to have fallen into a trap that also was a\nproblem for Morris, namely substituting one wrong for another. The\nwrong of being raped is not the message that the rapist\nsends; it is the rape. (For variations on these criticisms, see\nDolinko 1991: 551\u2013554; for Hampton's replies to her critics, see\nHampton 1992.)\n",
