    "preamble": "\n\nRegarding Bohr\u2019s correspondence principle, the historian of\nphysics Max Jammer writes, \u201c[T]here was rarely in the history of\nphysics a comprehensive theory which owed so much to one principle as\nquantum mechanics owed to Bohr\u2019s correspondence principle\u201d\n(Jammer 1966, p. 118). The correspondence principle not only played a\npivotal role in the discovery of quantum mechanics but was also the\ncornerstone of Bohr\u2019s philosophical interpretation of quantum\nmechanics, being closely tied to his better known thesis of\ncomplementarity and to the Copenhagen interpretation.\n\nAlthough the importance of Bohr\u2019s correspondence principle is\nlargely undisputed, there is far less agreement concerning how the\ncorrespondence principle should be defined. It is important to\ndistinguish between Bohr\u2019s own understanding of this principle\nand what it came to mean for the larger physics community. Even if one\nrestricts oneself to Bohr\u2019s writings, however, there is still a\ndisagreement among Bohr scholars regarding precisely which of the\nseveral relations between classical and quantum mechanics that Bohr\ndiscovered should be designated as the correspondence principle. There\nare three primary candidate-definitions in the literature. First,\nthere is the frequency interpretation, according to which the\ncorrespondence principle is a statistical asymptotic agreement between\none component in the Fourier decomposition of the classical frequency\nand the quantum frequency in the limit of large quantum numbers.\nSecond, there is the intensity interpretation according to\nwhich it is a statistical agreement in the limit of large quantum\nnumbers between the quantum intensity, understood in terms of the\nprobability of a quantum transition, and the classical intensity,\nunderstood as the square of the amplitude of one component of the\nclassical motion. Finally, there is the selection rule\ninterpretation, according to which the correspondence principle\nis the statement that each allowed quantum transition between\nstationary states corresponds to one harmonic component of the\nclassical motion.\n\nThe correspondence principle was first articulated in 1913 in the\ncontext of the old quantum theory. Nonetheless, Bohr argued that this\nprinciple survived the replacement of the old quantum theory by modern\nquantum mechanics. The correspondence principle is still referred to\ntoday in the physics literature as a subject of current research,\nthough arguably with a meaning that is somewhat different from\nBohr\u2019s own understanding of this principle.

    "main_text": "\n1. Background and Scientific Context\n\nNiels Bohr was a Danish physicist who lived from 1885 until 1962; he\nwas born and died in Copenhagen. He is best known as one of the\nfounders of quantum theory and for his work on the structure of atoms,\nwhich earned him the Nobel Prize in Physics in 1922. In addition to\nhis scientific work, he devoted much of his career to the\nphilosophical interpretation of quantum mechanics. He was involved in\na famous long-standing debate with Albert Einstein over whether\nquantum mechanics was a complete description of atomic phenomena (the\n\u201cEinstein-Bohr Debate\u201d), and his lasting contributions to\nthe philosophical interpretation of quantum theory include the\nCopenhagen interpretation, the thesis of complementarity, and the\ncorrespondence principle.\n\nThe correspondence principle was first introduced in the context of\nthe old quantum theory, which was developed in the period between 1900\nand 1925. The old quantum theory was an \u201cinterim\u201d theory\ndeveloped in response to the recognition that Newtonian mechanics and\nclassical electrodynamics are inadequate for the description of atomic\nsystems. Although the old quantum theory had remarkable empirical\nsuccesses, it was criticized for having what many thought were\ninconsistent foundations. The old quantum theory was ultimately\nreplaced by modern quantum mechanics with Werner Heisenberg\u2019s\ndevelopment of matrix mechanics in 1925 and Erwin\nSchr\u00f6dinger\u2019s development of wave mechanics in 1926.\n\nIn order to understand the substance of the correspondence principle,\nit is necessary to first understand the basic framework of the old\nquantum theory. Niels Bohr first articulated the postulates of the old\nquantum theory in 1913, in a three-part paper titled \u201cOn the\nConstitution of Atoms and Molecules\u201d (Bohr 1913). Bohr had\nadopted Ernest Rutherford\u2019s model of the atom, according to\nwhich most of the mass of the atom is concentrated in a small central\nnucleus, while the electrons orbit the nucleus in planetary\ntrajectories. The key challenge facing Rutherford\u2019s model was\nthat it was unstable: according to classical electrodynamics, the\nelectron, which is an accelerated charged body, should radiate energy\nand so rapidly collapse into the nucleus. Bohr\u2019s solution was to\nincorporate Max Planck\u2019s theory of radiation, which postulates\nthat \u201cthe energy radiation from an atomic system does not take\nplace in the continuous way assumed in ordinary electrodynamics, but\nthat it, on the contrary, takes place in distinctly separated\nemissions\u201d (Bohr 1913, p. 4; BCW 2, p.\n 164).[1]\n\nBohr summarized his quantum theory by means of two assumptions or\npostulates. According to the first postulate, electrons cannot travel\nin any path around the nucleus; rather, atomic systems can only exist\nin one of a series of discrete \u201cstationary states,\u201d in\nwhich the electron is in a particular allowed stable periodic orbit\nand is not emitting radiation. Intuitively, these stationary states\ncan be thought of as a series of concentric circular orbits around the\nnucleus, along which the electron travels; these stationary states are\nlabeled by means of the principal quantum number \\(n\\), with the\nlowest allowed orbit (the \u201cnormal\u201d or ground state)\nlabeled \\(n = 1\\), the next stationary state of higher energy\n\\(n = 2\\), and so on. Bohr postulates that when the electron is\nin one of these stationary states, its motions can be adequately\ndescribed by means of classical mechanics; however, when the electron\nmakes a transition from one stationary state to another, the classical\ntheory no longer applies. The second postulate of Bohr\u2019s old\nquantum theory is that, when there is a transition between different\nstationary states, \\(n'\\) and \\(n''\\), the\nemitted radiation is of a single frequency, \\(\\nu\\), that is given by the\ndifference in the energy of the two states,\n\\((E_{n'} - E_{n''})\\), divided by Planck\u2019s\nconstant.\n\n\\[\\tag{1}\n\\nu = \\frac{E_{n'} - E_{n''}}{h}\n\\]\n\n\nThis formula is typically referred to as the \u201cBohr-Einstein\nfrequency condition.\u201d The second postulate constituted a\nsignificant break from classical electrodynamics, according to which a\nvariety of radiation frequencies would be emitted and those\nfrequencies would be determined solely by the motion of the\nsource.\n\nIt is important to note that while it is now accepted that this\nemitted radiation is a photon, Bohr himself was surprisingly skeptical\nof the photon concept up until as late as the mid-1920s (Stachel\n2009). Bohr preferred to think of the emitted or absorbed radiation as\na wave, rather than as a particle. Bohr\u2019s hesitation in\naccepting the existence of photons during this period seems to arise\nfrom his concern that such a particle conception of light would be\nirreconcilable with familiar interference phenomena. For example, Bohr\nwrites in 1921,\n\nThus according to this theory of light quanta, electromagnetic\nradiation from an atom should not spread as a system of spherical\nwaves, but should be propagated in a definite direction as a\nconcentrated entity, containing within a very small volume the energy\n\\(h\\nu\\). On one hand such a conception seems to offer the only\nsimple possibility of accounting for the phenomena of photoelectric\naction, if we adhere to an unrestricted application of the notions of\nconservation of energy and momentum. On the other hand, it does not\nappear reconcilable with the phenomena of interference of light, which\nconstitute our only means of analysing radiation in its harmonic\nconstituents and determining the frequency and state of polarisation\nof each of these constituents. (Bohr 1921a unpublished; BCW 3, pp.\n412\u2013413)\n\n\nIt is interesting that Bohr\u2019s initial rejection of the photon\nconcept was also tied to the importance of being able to analyze\nradiation into its harmonic components, which was essential for the\napplication of his correspondence principle (discussed below). As John\nStachel notes, \u201cIt was indeed, his reliance on the\ncorrespondence principle that seems to have been a principal motive\nfor Bohr\u2019s distrust of the photon concept and his related\nwillingness to give up energy-momentum conservation to save the\nclassical electrodynamic picture of radiation\u201d (Stachel 2009,\np.72). Stachel argues that it was, in part, the results of the\nBothe-Geiger and Compton-Simon experiments that finally led Bohr to\nembrace the concept of the photon. For these historical reasons, care\nneeds to be exercised in invoking the photon concept when discussing\nBohr\u2019s early views; nonetheless the concept of photons can be\nvery helpful in understanding the physics behind the correspondence\nprinciple (as well as Bohr\u2019s views after the early-1920s), and\nhence, will be invoked in the following exposition.\n\nReturning to the outline of the old quantum theory, Bohr\u2019s two\npostulates were not yet enough to pick out, from all of the\nclassically allowed orbits, those orbits corresponding to stationary\nstates. In order to determine the stationary states, the following\n\u201cquantum condition\u201d also needs to be introduced:\n\n\\[\\tag{2}\n\\oint p_{\\theta} d\\theta = nh \\,.\n\\]\n\n\nwhere the integral is taken over one period of the electron orbit, and\n\\(p_{\\theta}\\) is the angular momentum, \\(\\theta\\) is the angle in the plane of the electron orbit,\nand \\(n\\) is the quantum number.[2] As Max Jammer summarizes, applying the old\nquantum theory consists of essentially three steps: \u201cfirst, the\napplication of classical mechanics for the determination of the\npossible motions of the system; second, the imposition of certain\nquantum conditions for the selection of the actual or allowed motions;\nand third, the treatment of the radiative processes as transitions\nbetween allowed motions subject to the Bohr frequency formula\u201d\n(Jammer 1966, p. 90). The old quantum theory was a blending of\nclassical and quantum ideas: while it is assumed that the motion of an\nelectron within a particular stationary state can still be\ndescribed on the basis of the classical theory, the radiation given\noff in a transition between stationary states (the\n\u201cquantum jumps\u201d) cannot.\n\nIn order to understand the substance of the correspondence principle\nit is helpful to consider a simplified model of the atom as a\none-dimensional system, where the electron is undergoing simply\nperiodic motion. Classically the trajectory of the electron is given\nby \\(x(t)\\), which is the solution to Newton\u2019s\nequation of motion, and is periodic, which means it simply retraces\nits steps over and over again with a frequency, \\(\\omega\\), known as the\nfundamental frequency. Because the motion is periodic, the position of\nthe electron can be represented by a Fourier series as\n follows:[3]\n\n\\[\\tag{3}\nx(t) = C_1\\cos(\\omega t) + C_2\\cos(2\\omega t) + C_3\\cos(3\\omega t) + \\cdots\\,.\n\\] \n\n\nEach of these terms in the sum is known as a harmonic, and the\n\\(\\tau\\)th harmonic is given in terms of the time, \\(t\\),\nan amplitude, \\(C_{\\tau}\\), and a frequency,\n\\(\\omega_{\\tau}\\), which is an integer multiple of the\nfundamental frequency, \\(\\omega_{\\tau} = \\tau \\omega\\) (these\nmultiples of the fundamental frequency are referred to as the\n\u201covertones\u201d). According to classical\nelectrodynamics, the frequencies of the radiation emitted by this atom\nshould just be given by the frequencies in the harmonics of the\nmotion: \\(\\omega,\\) \\(2\\omega,\\) \\(3\\omega,\\) etc.; hence the spectrum of this\nclassical system should be a series of discrete evenly spaced\nlines.\n\nAccording to Bohr\u2019s old quantum theory, by contrast, the\nradiation is not a result of the accelerated motion of the electron in\nits orbit, but rather of the electron jumping from one stationary\nstate to another; and rather than giving off all of the harmonic\n\u201covertones\u201d together, only a single frequency, \\(\\nu\\), is\nemitted, and the value of that frequency is given by the Bohr-Einstein\nfrequency condition (Equation 1). The spectral lines are built up by a\nwhole ensemble of atoms undergoing transitions between different\nstationary states, and these spectral lines, though they exhibit a\npattern of regularity, are not evenly spaced\u2014except in the limit\nof large quantum numbers.\n\nFollowing Bohr, one can label the difference between the\n\\(n'\\) stationary state and the \\(n''\\)\nstationary state by \\(\\tau\\); that is, if the electron jumps to the\nnearest stationary state, \\(\\tau = 1\\); if it jumps two stationary states\naway, \\(\\tau = 2\\); and so on. Although according to the classical\ndefinition \\(\\tau\\) specifies a particular harmonic component of the\nclassical motion, according to the quantum mechanical definition \\(\\tau\\)\nspecifies the change in the quantum number in a particular jump.\n2. The Correspondence Principle Defined\n\nAmong current Bohr scholars there is a consensus that Bohr did not\nintend his correspondence principle to designate some sort of general\nrequirement that quantum mechanics recover the predictions of\nclassical mechanics in the classical limit, despite the prevalence of\nthis interpretation in the physics literature (see Section 6). There\nis far less agreement, however, concerning precisely which relation\nbetween classical and quantum mechanics Bohr intended to designate by\nthe correspondence principle. There are three prominent contenders in\nthe literature, all of which find support in Bohr\u2019s writings.\nThese three interpretations can be labeled: the frequency\ninterpretation, the intensity interpretation, and the selection rule\ninterpretation.\n\nAccording to the frequency interpretation, the correspondence\nprinciple is defined as a statistical asymptotic agreement between the\n(quantum) frequency, \\(\\nu_{n' \\rightarrow n''}\\), of radiation\nemitted in a quantum jump of difference \\(\\tau\\) from state \\(n'\\) to\n\\(n''\\) and the (classical) frequency \\((\\omega_{\\tau})\\) in the\n\\(\\tau\\)th harmonic of the classical motion in the \\(n'\\)\nstationary state, namely\n\n\\[\\tag{4}\n\\nu_{n' \\rightarrow n''} = \\omega_{\\tau} = \\tau \\omega, \\text{ for\nlarge } n,\n\\]\n\n\nwhere, \\(n' - n'' = \\tau\\).\n\nNote that this equality between the quantum frequency and one\ncomponent of the classical frequency only holds in the limit of\nlarge quantum numbers\u2014not for low quantum-number\ntransitions. Moreover there is only a statistical agreement since\nclassically all the frequencies will be given off together, while\nquantum mechanically only a single photon is emitted with a single\nfrequency in any given transition between stationary states; hence,\none must consider a statistical ensemble of atoms to compare with the\nclassical spectrum.\n\nAccording to the intensity interpretation, the correspondence\nprinciple is defined as the agreement, in the limit of large quantum\nnumbers, between the probability, \\(P_{n' \\rightarrow n''}\\), of a\ntransition between two stationary states separated by \\(\\tau\\) and the\nsquare of the amplitude, \\(C_{\\tau}\\), of the \\(\\tau\\)th\nharmonic component of the classical motion:\n\n\\[\\tag{5}\nP_{n' \\rightarrow n''} \\propto |C_{\\tau}(n)|^2 \\text{ for large } n.\n\\]\n\n\nThus in the limit of large \\(n\\) the amplitudes of the harmonic\ncomponents of the electron\u2019s classical orbit can be used to\ncalculate the intensities of the spectral lines. While classically the\nintensity of radiation is determined by its amplitude, quantum\nmechanically the intensity of a spectral line is determined by how\nmany photons are emitted at that particular frequency. Hence, the more\nprobable a particular quantum transition is, the more photons will be\ngiven off, and the greater the intensity. Note that, as with the\nfrequency interpretation, this is a correspondence that holds only\nstatistically and only in the limit of large quantum\n numbers.[4]\n\nAccording to the selection rule interpretation, Bohr\u2019s\ncorrespondence principle is best understood as the statement that\neach allowed quantum transition between stationary states\ncorresponds to one harmonic component of the classical motion.\nMore precisely, Bohr\u2019s selection rule states that the transition\nfrom a stationary state \\(n'\\) to another stationary state\n\\(n''\\) is allowed if and only if there exists a\n\\(\\tau\\)th harmonic in the classical motion of the electron in\nthe initial stationary state; if there is no \\(\\tau\\)th\nharmonic in the classical motion, then transitions between stationary\nstates whose separation is \\(\\tau\\) are not allowed quantum mechanically.\nThe essence of Bohr\u2019s correspondence principle is depicted in\nFigure 1.\n\n\nFigure 1.\nA classical periodic orbit, \\(x(t)\\), can be represented as a Fourier\nsum of \u201charmonics\u201d which are integer multiples of the\nfundamental frequency, \\(\\omega\\), representing the periodicity of the\nmotion. According to the selection rule interpretation, the\ncorrespondence principle is Bohr\u2019s insight that each allowed\ntransition between stationary states corresponds to one harmonic\ncomponent of the classical motion. (Based on Fig. 3 of Fedak and\nPrentis 2002)\n\n\nBohr\u2019s selection rule can be illustrated by the following\nsimplified\n example.[5]\n Suppose that the solution to Newton\u2019s equation,\n\\(F = m d^2 x/dt^2\\),\nand the quantum condition \\(\\oint pdx = nh\\)\n is[6]\n\n\\[\\tag{6}\nx(t,n) = n\\cos(n^{\\frac{1}{2}}t) + n^{\\frac{1}{2}}\\cos(3n^{\\frac{1}{2}}t),\n\\]\n\n\nwhich is the Fourier decomposition of the classical periodic motion of\nthe electron in an allowed stationary state \\(n\\). For this\nstationary state \\(n\\), the fundamental frequency (i.e.,\nperiodicity of the electron motion) is \\(\\omega = n^{\\frac{1}{2}}\\). Note that there are only the first\n\\((\\tau = 1)\\) and third \\((\\tau = 3)\\) harmonics present in the classical\nmotion (Equation 6). According to Bohr\u2019s selection rule, this\nmeans that there can only be quantum jumps between stationary states\nthat are one or three stationary states apart. So, for example, there\ncan be transitions from the \\(n = 100\\) stationary state to the\n\\(n = 99\\) or \\(n = 97\\) stationary states; but there cannot\nbe transitions from the \\(n = 100\\) stationary state to the\n\\(n = 98\\) stationary state, because there is no second harmonic\nin the classical electron orbit.\n\nUnlike the frequency and intensity interpretations of the\ncorrespondence principle, the selection rule interpretation is not an\nasymptotic relation\u2014it applies to all quantum number\ntransitions, including small \\(n\\).\n\nIt is important to recognize that Bohr discovered and wrote about all\nthese correspondence relations; the disagreement among Bohr scholars\nis simply which (if any) of these correspondence relations\nBohr meant to designate as the correspondence principle. Some scholars\nhave even gone so far as to doubt whether Bohr ever had a well-defined\nand unvarying definition of the correspondence principle at all. These\nand other interpretations of the correspondence principle are\nelaborated in more detail in Section 5 below.\n3. Bohr\u2019s Writings on the Correspondence Principle (1918\u20131928)\n\nMost of Bohr\u2019s writings on the correspondence principle are\ncollected in Volume 3 of Niels Bohr Collected Works\n(abbreviated here BCW), which is titled The Correspondence\nPrinciple (1918\u20131923). As Bohr himself reports (Bohr 1922),\nthe first germ of the correspondence principle can be found in his\n1913 lecture \u201cOn the constitution of molecules and atoms,\u201d\nalthough the term does not appear in his writings until 1920. In the\nyears before Bohr adopted the expression \u201ccorrespondence\nprinciple,\u201d he described the relation as an analogy between\nclassical and quantum mechanics. For example, in his 1918 paper\n\u201cOn the Quantum Theory of Line Spectra.\u201d (which he refers\nto as \u201cQ.o.L.\u201d) Bohr writes, \u201cIt seems possible to\nthrow some light on the outstanding difficulties by trying to trace\nthe analogy between the quantum theory and the ordinary theory of\nradiation as closely as possible\u201d (Bohr 1918, p. 4; BCW 3, p.\n70). In his later writings, however, Bohr explicitly rejects this view\nthat the correspondence principle can be thought of as an analogy. He\nwrites,\n\nIn Q.o.L [Bohr 1918] this designation has not yet been used, but the\nsubstance of the principle is referred to there as a formal analogy\nbetween the quantum theory and the classical theory. Such expressions\nmight cause misunderstanding, since in fact\u2014as we shall see\nlater on\u2014this Correspondence Principle must be regarded purely\nas a law of the quantum theory, which can in no way diminish the\ncontrast between the postulates and electrodynamic theory. (Bohr\n[1923] 1924, fn. p. 22)\n\n\nNot only does Bohr reject the view that the correspondence principle\nis an analogy, but the fact that he refers to it as a law of\nquantum theory suggests, first, that he takes it to be a\nuniversal principle (not just applicable in a limited\ndomain), and, second, that it is an essential part of quantum theory\nitself, not some sort of general methodological constraint coming from\noutside of quantum theory.\n\nIn his 1920 paper where the terms \u201ccorrespondence\u201d and\n\u201ccorrespondence principle\u201d first appear (Nielsen 1976, p.\n21), Bohr writes,\n\n[A]lthough the process of radiation can not be described on the basis\nof the ordinary theory of electrodynamics, according to which the\nnature of the radiation emitted by an atom is directly related to the\nharmonic components occurring in the motion of the system, there is\nfound, nevertheless, to exist a far-reaching correspondence\nbetween the various types of possible transitions between the\nstationary states on the one hand and the various harmonic components\nof the motion on the other hand. This correspondence is of such a\nnature, that the present theory of spectra is in a certain sense to be\nregarded as a rational generalization of the ordinary theory of\nradiation. (Bohr 1920, pp. 23\u201324; BCW 3, pp. 245\u2013246)\n\n\nThe correspondence Bohr describes here is between allowed transitions\nfrom one stationary state to another and the harmonic components of\nthe classical motion. Moreover, he takes this correspondence to be the\nground or justification for the view that quantum theory is a rational\ngeneralization of classical mechanics (for a discussion of this latter\nview see Bokulich and Bokulich 2005). A few pages later, in a section\ntitled \u201cThe Correspondence Principle,\u201d Bohr goes on to\ndescribe both the frequency correspondence and the intensity\ncorrespondence:\n\nThis correspondence between frequencies determined by the two methods\nmust have a deeper significance and we are led to anticipate that it\nwill also apply to the intensities. This is equivalent to the\nstatement that, when the quantum numbers are large, the relative\nprobability of a particular transition is connected in a simple manner\nwith the amplitude of the corresponding harmonic component in the\nmotion. This peculiar relation suggests a general law for the\noccurrence of transitions between stationary states. Thus we\nshall assume that even when the quantum numbers are small the\npossibility of transition between two stationary states is connected\nwith the presence of a certain harmonic component in the motion of the\nsystem. (Bohr 1920, pp. 27\u201328; BCW 3, pp. 249\u2013250)\n\n\nIn typical Bohr style, he fails to come out and clearly say whether\none, all, or none of these correspondences is what he means to\ndesignate by \u201cthe correspondence principle.\u201d\n\nBohr also argues that the correspondence principle is something which\nexplains why only certain spectral lines are observed in experiments.\nHe writes,\n\nThe above view, which may be termed the correspondence principle\n\u2026 has offered an immediate interpretation of the apparent\ncapriciousness, involved in the application of the principle of\ncombination of spectral lines, which consists in the circumstance,\nthat only a small part of the spectral lines, which might be\nanticipated from an unrestricted application of this [Rydberg-Ritz\ncombination] principle, are actually observed in the experiments.\n(Bohr 1921b unpublished; BCW 4, p. 150)\n\n\nBokulich (2008, and 2009 [Other Internet Resources]) has argued that\ninterpreting the correspondence principle in terms of the selection\nrule not only illuminates Bohr\u2019s claim that it explains the\ncapriciousness of the spectral lines, but also his claim that the\ncorrespondence principle is a law of quantum theory. Indeed, the\ncorrespondence that he refers to as a \u201claw\u201d is the\nselection rule correspondence, which holds also for small quantum\nnumbers, not just in the classical limit. It is a law because\nit is a universal (i.e., applying to all \\(n)\\) restriction on\nthe allowed quantum transitions. To understand why it is a law of\nquantum theory (as opposed to a law of classical electrodynamics)\nit is helpful to consider Bohr\u2019s following remarks:\n\n[T]he occurrence of radiative transitions is conditioned by the\npresence of the corresponding vibrations in the motion of the atom. As\nto our right to regard the asymptotic relation obtained as the\nintimation of a general law of the quantum theory for the occurrence\nof radiation, as it is assumed to be in the Correspondence Principle\nmentioned above, let it be once more recalled that in the limiting\nregion of large quantum numbers there is no wise a question of a\ngradual diminution of the difference between the description by the\nquantum theory of the phenomena of radiation and the ideas of\nclassical electrodynamics, but only an asymptotic agreement of the\nstatistical results. (Bohr [1923] 1924, p. 23; BCW 3, p. 480)\n\n\nIn this passage it is clear that Bohr takes quantum mechanics to be a\nuniversal theory. Despite the statistical agreement of results in this\nlimit, the physics of the frequencies and intensities, for example,\nremains different, and Bohr is insistent that it is the quantum\naccount that is the strictly correct one\u2014even in this high\n\\(n\\) or \u201cclassical\u201d limit. Hence, when Bohr\ndiscovered that the allowable quantum transitions are those for which\nthere is a corresponding harmonic in the classical motion, what he had\ndiscovered was something about quantum theory.\n\nIn his 1922 lectures on atomic theory in G\u00f6ttingen, Bohr again\nemphasizes that the correspondence principle holds even for low\nquantum number transitions. This can particularly be seen in his\ndiscussion of the well-known red and green spectral lines of the\nBalmer series in the visible part of the hydrogen spectrum. The red\nspectral line (which really is red at a wavelength of around 656 nm)\nis typically labeled \\(\\rH_{\\alpha}\\), and is the result of\nradiation emitted in the jump from the \\(n = 3\\) to \\(n =\n2\\) stationary state. The green line (labeled \\(\\rH_{\\beta}\\) with a\nwavelength of around 486 nm) is a result of the electron in a hydrogen\natom jumping from the \\(n = 4\\) to \\(n = 2\\) stationary\nstate.\n\n\n\n\nFigure 2.\nRed and green spectral lines of the Balmer series in the visible part\nof the hydrogen atom\n\n\nRegarding these low-quantum-number transitions Bohr writes,\n\nWe may regard \\(\\rH_{\\beta}\\) as the octave of \\(\\rH_{\\alpha}\\),\nsince \\(\\rH_{\\beta}\\) corresponds to a jump of 2 and\n\\(\\rH_{\\alpha}\\) to a quantum jump of 1. It is true that\n\\(\\rH_{\\beta}\\) does not have twice the frequency of\n\\(\\rH_{\\alpha}\\), but it corresponds to the octave. This\nrelationship we call the \u2018correspondence principle.\u2019 To\neach transition there corresponds a harmonic component of the\nmechanical motion. (Bohr 1922 unpublished lecture; BCW4, p. 348)\n\n\nIn other words, although the \u201cfrequency correspondence\u201d\ndoes not hold for these low quantum numbers (nor can the intensities\nof these lines be calculated directly from the classical amplitudes\nvia the \u201cintensity correspondence\u201d), what Bohr is here\ncalling the more general correspondence principle does hold;\nspecifically, these \\(\\tau = 1\\) and \\(\\tau = 2\\) transitions are allowed\nbecause there is, in the Fourier decomposition of the electron\u2019s\nclassical orbit in the initial stationary state, a first and second\nharmonic component. Such passages are a challenge for those who want\nto interpret the correspondence principle as some sort of asymptotic\nrelation holding in the classical limit.\n\nThere is a remarkable continuity in Bohr\u2019s statements on the\ncorrespondence principle. In 1923 one again finds Bohr emphasizing\nthat the allowed or possible transitions between stationary states are\nconnected to the harmonic components present in the classical\nmotion.\n\n\n[T]he possibility of the occurrence of a transition, accompanied by\nradiation, between two states of a multiply periodic system, of\nquantum numbers for example \\(n_1', \\ldots, n_u'\\) and \\(n_1'',\n\\ldots, n_u''\\), is conditioned by the presence\nof certain harmonic components in the expression given by [the Fourier\nseries expansion of the classical electron motion]. The frequencies\n\\(\\tau_1\\omega_1 + \\ldots + \\tau_u\\omega_u\\) of these\nharmonic components are given by the following equation\n\n\\[\n\\tau_1 = n_1' - n_1'' \\quad\\ldots\\quad \\tau_u = n_u' - n_u''.\n\\]\n\n\nWe, therefore, call these the \u201ccorresponding\u201d harmonic\ncomponents in the motion, and the substance of the above statement we\ndesignate as the \u201cCorrespondence Principle.\u201d (Bohr [1923]\n1924, p. 22; BCW 3, p. 479)\n\n\nIn 1925 Werner Heisenberg published his famous \u201cUmdeutung\u201d\npaper introducing matrix mechanics (Heisenberg 1925). This would be\nthe beginning of modern quantum mechanics, which replaced the old\nquantum theory. In a supplement to Nature published in\nDecember of 1925, Bohr describes what he takes to be the relationship\nof the new quantum mechanics to his correspondence principle. He\nbegins with a statement of the correspondence principle.\n\nThe demonstration of the asymptotic agreement between spectrum and\nmotion gave rise to the formulation of the \u201ccorrespondence\nprinciple,\u201d according to which the possibility of every\ntransition process connected with emission of radiation is conditioned\nby the presence of a corresponding harmonic component in the motion of\nthe atom. Not only do the frequencies of the corresponding harmonic\ncomponents agree asymptotically with the values obtained from the\nfrequency condition in the limit where the energies of the stationary\nstates converge, but also the amplitudes of the mechanical oscillatory\ncomponents give in this limit an asymptotic measure for the\nprobabilities of the transition processes on which the intensities of\nthe observable spectral lines depend. (Bohr 1925, pp. 848\u2013849;\nBCW 5, pp. 276\u2013277)\n\n\nIn this quotation Bohr notes all three correspondence relations: the\nselection rule correspondence, the asymptotic frequency\ncorrespondence, and the asymptotic intensity correspondence. Bohr then\nturns to a discussion of Heisenberg\u2019s matrix mechanics paper,\narguing that\n\nIt [the new matrix mechanics] operates with manifolds of quantities,\nwhich replace the harmonic oscillating components of the motion and\nsymbolise the possibilities of transitions between stationary states\nin conformity with the correspondence principle\u2026 In brief, the\nwhole apparatus of the quantum mechanics can be regarded as a precise\nformulation of the tendencies embodied in the correspondence\nprinciple. (Bohr 1925, p. 852; BCW 5, p. 280)\n\n\nWhat Bohr seems to be saying in this passage is that the new quantum\nmechanics symbolizes the allowed transitions in conformity with his\nselection rule.\n\nBohr continued to discuss the correspondence principle even after the\nadvent of modern quantum mechanics. In his 1928 Como lecture, for\nexample, he writes,\n\nThe aim of regarding the quantum theory as a rational generalisation\nof the classical theories led to the formulation of the so-called\ncorrespondence principle. The utilisation of this principle for the\ninterpretation of spectroscopic results was based on a symbolical\napplication of classical electrodynamics, in which the individual\ntransition processes were each associated with a harmonic in the\nmotion of the atomic particles to be expected according to ordinary\nmechanics. (Bohr 1928, p. 584; BCW 6, p. 152)\n\n\nNote that Bohr here speaks of a \u201csymbolic\u201d application of\nclassical electrodynamics\u2014the electron trajectories in the\nstationary states, for example, are not to be interpreted literally or\neven \u201cformally.\u201d This shift in Bohr\u2019s understanding\nof the status of the electron trajectories being employed in the\ncorrespondence principle has been emphasized in particular by Olivier\nDarrigol (Darrigol 1997, p. 558).\n\nNonetheless, as in 1920 when he first introduced the term\ncorrespondence principle, Bohr is here in 1928 (after the replacement\nof the old quantum theory by modern quantum mechanics) interpreting\nthe correspondence principle as a connection between transition\nprocesses and harmonics in the classical motion of the particles.\nMoreover, just as in 1920, he is explicitly tying the correspondence\nprinciple to his view that quantum mechanics is a rational\ngeneralization of classical mechanics. The correspondence principle\nthus provided a conceptual link between classical mechanics (and\nelectrodynamics), the old quantum theory, and modern quantum\nmechanics. This rational generalization thesis in turn was the\nfoundation of Bohr\u2019s views on complementarity, and more broadly,\nhis Copenhagen interpretation of quantum mechanics. Thus the\ncorrespondence principle was not only technically important in the\ndiscovery of modern quantum mechanics, as Jammer (1966, p. 118) has\nemphasized, but it was also was the very foundation of Bohr\u2019s\nphilosophy.\n4. Early Responses\n\nEarly responders to Bohr\u2019s correspondence principle can be\nroughly divided into three categories: those who misunderstood the\nprinciple (e.g., Born and Rosenfeld), those who embraced and developed\nit (e.g., Kramers and van Vleck), and those who seemed to understand\nit, but nevertheless mistrusted it (e.g., Sommerfeld, Pauli, and\nHeisenberg).\n\nIt is unclear how well many of Bohr\u2019s contemporaries understood\nwhat he meant by the correspondence principle. For example, even\nL\u00e9on Rosenfeld, one of Bohr\u2019s closest students and\ncollaborators, recalls Bohr\u2019s annoyance over his failure to have\ncorrectly understood the substance of this principle (Rosenfeld [1973]\n1979, p. 690). This is perhaps not entirely surprising given the\nturbidity of Bohr\u2019s writings. Bohr himself was quite conscious\nof the fact that his dense writing style often led others to\nmisunderstand him. In a letter to Arnold Sommerfeld, Bohr laments,\n\nIn the last few years I have often felt myself scientifically\nvery lonesome, under the impression that my efforts to develop the\nprinciples of the quantum theory systematically to the best of my\nability have been received with very little understanding\u2026 I\nunderstand quite well how little the matters are clarified as yet, and\nhow helpless I am at expressing my thoughts in easily accessible\nform. (Bohr to Sommerfeld, April 30, 1922; BCW 3, p. 39)\n\n\nIndeed one quickly sees a wide variety of different interpretations of\nthe correspondence principle emerging in the physics\nliterature\u2014a variety of interpretations that persists to this\nday. Hence, it is important to distinguish Bohr\u2019s own views on\nthe correspondence principle from what the correspondence principle\ncame to mean to the broader physics community (for a detailed account\nof how the correspondence principle drove research and discussions in\nthis period, see J\u00e4hnert 2019). Both Hendrik Kramers and John van\nVleck, for example, used and extended the term \u201ccorrespondence\nprinciple\u201d to cover a wide range of correspondence-type\narguments that were important in the development of quantum mechanics\n(see, for example, Duncan and Janssen 2007; 2019).\n\nAmong those who seemed to correctly understand the core of\nBohr\u2019s correspondence principle, even fewer embraced it. Indeed\nmany of Bohr\u2019s contemporaries were distrustful of the principle,\ndespite their willingness to opportunistically make use of it to\nobtain concrete results when other methods failed. Into this third\ncategory fall three of the most important contemporaneous critics of\nthe correspondence principle: Arnold Sommerfeld, Wolfgang Pauli, and\nWerner\n Heisenberg.[7]\n4.1 Sommerfeld\n\nOne of the earliest and most forceful critics of Bohr\u2019s\ncorrespondence principle was Arnold Sommerfeld (1868\u20131951). As\nDarrigol has recounted in detail, Sommerfeld was never comfortable\nwith Bohr\u2019s correspondence principle, and only begrudgingly\nadmitted its fertility (Darrigol 1992, pp. 138\u2013145). Sommerfeld\npreferred to view quantum theory as a self-contained set of formal\nrules, and wanted to derive the selection rules \u201cby a remarkably\nrigorous manner of deduction, reminiscent of the incontrovertible\nlogic of numerical calculations\u201d (Sommerfeld [1919] 1923, pp.\n265\u2013266). In the first edition of his book Atombau und\nSpektrallinen (Atomic Structure and Spectral Lines)\nSommerfeld disparagingly refers to Bohr\u2019s correspondence\nprinciple as a \u201cmagic wand\u201d:\n\nBohr has discovered in his principle of correspondence a\nmagic wand (which he himself calls a formal principle), which allows\nus immediately to make use of the results of the classical wave theory\nin the quantum theory. (Sommereld [1919] 1923, p.\n 275)[8]\n\n\nIn the second edition of Atombau Sommerfeld softens his\ncriticism of the correspondence principle, noting its great fertility.\nIn a letter written to Bohr in November of 1920 Sommerfeld writes,\n\nIn the appendices of my book, you can see that I have taken some pains\nto show the value of your correspondence principle better than in the\n1. edition\u2026 Nonetheless, I must confess that the origin of your\nprinciple, which is foreign to quantum theory, is still distressing to\nme, however much I recognize that through it a most important\nconnection between quantum th. and classical electrodynamics is\nrevealed. (Sommerfeld to Bohr, 11 November 1920; BCW 3, p. 690)\n\n\nSuman Seth (2008) has argued that Sommerfeld\u2019s dissatisfaction\nwith the correspondence principle stemmed not so much from a\ncommitment to formal rules as Darrigol suggests, but more from his\ngeneral distrust of analogical thinking and what he took to be an\nillegitimate mixing of quantum and classical concepts. We see this,\nfor example, in Sommerfeld\u2019s 1924 article on Bohr\u2019s atomic\nmodels, where he writes,\n\nThe magic of the correspondence principle has proved itself generally\nthrough the selection rules of the quantum numbers, in the series and\nband spectra\u2026 Nonetheless I cannot view it as ultimately\nsatisfying on account of its mixing of quantum-theoretical and\nclassical viewpoints. (Sommerfeld 1924, p. 1048; quoted also in Seth\n2008, p. 345).\n\n\nSommerfeld\u2019s critical attitude toward the correspondence\nprinciple would prove influential on Wolfgang Pauli and Werner\nHeisenberg, both of whom were his doctoral students.\n4.2 Pauli\n\nIn his lecture accepting the Nobel Prize (which was awarded in 1945\nfor his discovery of the exclusion principle) Wolfgang Pauli describes\nthe fundamental methodological differences between Bohr and\nSommerfeld:\n\nAt that time there were two approaches to the difficult problems\nconnected with the quantum of action. One was an effort to bring\nabstract order to the new ideas by looking for a key to translate\nclassical mechanics and electrodynamics into quantum language which\nwould form a logical generalization of these. This was the direction\nwhich was taken by Bohr\u2019s \u201ccorrespondence\nprinciple.\u201d Sommerfeld, however, preferred, in view of the\ndifficulties which blocked the use of the concepts of kinematical\nmodels, a direct interpretation, as independent of models as possible,\nof the laws of spectra in terms of integral numbers\u2026 (Pauli\n1946, p. 27)\n\n\nAlthough in hindsight, Pauli claims that both methodologies influenced\nhim, in his correspondence dating from 1924 and 1925, one finds Pauli\nalmost exclusively defending a Sommerfeldian approach, dismissing both\nthe correspondence principle and model-based reasoning more generally.\nPauli\u2019s critical remarks about Bohr\u2019s correspondence\nprinciple center on two issues. First, Pauli objected to the use of\neven a \u201cformal\u201d notion of an electron orbit, which is\ncentral to the application of the correspondence principle (e.g.,\nPauli to Bohr, February 21st 1924). Second, Pauli doubted that the\ncorrespondence principle would be able to explain the closing of the\nelectron shells as Bohr had hoped. In 1924 Pauli wrote to Bohr:\n\nI have already often said to you that I am of the opinion that the\nCorrespondence Principle has in reality nothing to do with the problem\nof the closing of the groups in the atom\u2026 The exclusion of\ncertain stationary states (not transitions), which is what is\nin question here, has more similarity in principle with the exclusion\nof the state \\(m = 0\\) or \\(k = 0\\) in the H-atom than, for\nexample, with the selection rule \\(\\Delta k = \\pm 1\\). Do you\nstill cling to your \u2026 application of the Correspondence\nPrinciple in this case? \u2026 There is moreover no need whatever to\ntalk of harmonic interplay. (Pauli to Bohr, December 12th, 1924;\nquoted in Serwer 1977, p. 235)\n\n\nReading between the lines, Pauli seems to understand Bohr\u2019s\ncorrespondence principle as a selection rule about transitions between\nstationary states that are connected with harmonics in the classical\nmotion. His objection is not to this correspondence principle, but\nrather with attempts at extending this principle to explain the\nclosing of electron groups in the atom\u2014the sort of extension of\nthe correspondence principle that Pauli elsewhere referred to as\n\u201ccorrespondence principle imperialism\u201d (Imperialismus\ndes Korrespondenzprinzips) (Pauli to Heisenberg, February 28th,\n1925; quoted in Serwer 1977, p.233). The closing of electron shells\nwould ultimately be explained by Pauli\u2019s exclusion principle,\nthough initially Pauli was dissatisfied with such an explanation\ninsofar as his exclusion rule could not be given a more general\ngrounding and justification. When Bohr suggested that the\ncorrespondence principle might provide such a grounding for the\nexclusion principle, Pauli replied,\n\nI personally do not believe, however, that the correspondence\nprinciple will lead to a foundation of the rule\u2026 For weak men,\nwho need the crutch of the idea of unambiguously defined electron\norbits and mechanical models, the rule can be grounded as follows:\n\u2018If more than one electron have the same quantum numbers in\nstrong fields, they would have the same orbits and would therefore\ncollide\u2026 The justification of the exclusion of the\nabove-mentioned cases in the H-atom by pointing to the collision with\nthe nucleus has never pleased me much. It would be much more\nsatisfying if we could understand directly on the grounds of\na more general quantum mechanics (one that deviates from classical\nmechanics). (Pauli to Bohr December 31st, 1924; quoted in Heilbron\n1983, p. 306 and Serwer 1977, p. 236)\n\n\nIn the above quotation we see Pauli siding with Sommerfeld, in his\ndistrust of the correspondence principle and model-based reasoning in\ngeneral, and in his preference for a \u201cdirect\u201d\ninterpretation in terms of a new quantum mechanics.\n4.3 Heisenberg\n\nAs Jagdish Mehra and Helmut Rechenberg (1982) have recounted, when\nWerner Heisenberg first arrived in Copenhagen to work with Bohr in\n1924, he enthusiastically embraced the correspondence principle and\ntook up the task of defending this principle to the broader physics\ncommunity. This is especially clear in a letter Heisenberg wrote to\nPauli on September 30th, 1924:\n\nTogether with Bohr I have again examined the problem carefully, and we\narrived at the conclusion that it is not\u2014as Sommerfeld\nsays\u2014that the sum-rules cannot be understood with the help of\nthe correspondence principle; on the contrary they are a necessary\nconsequence of the correspondence principle\u2026 We are very\nhappy about this interpretation for now the attacks against the\ncorrespondence principle are completely refuted\u2026 [S]ince\nrecently the correspondence principle has been blamed so much, it\nwould be good to publish it [your results confirming the\ncorrespondence principle] ad majorem correspondentiae principii\ngloriam [for the greater glory of the correspondence principle].\n(Heisenberg to Pauli, September 30th, 1924; quoted in Mehra\nand Rechenberg pp. 156\u2013157)\n\n\nBy 1925, however, Heisenberg increasingly began to distance himself\nfrom the correspondence principle. Daniel Serwer attributes this shift\nin Heisenberg\u2019s views to Pauli\u2019s influence:\n\n[I]n early March 1925, Pauli came to Copenhagen. This visit was\ncrucial to Heisenberg. Under pressure from Pauli, he began to change\nhis views on many issues\u2026[including] the Correspondence\nPrinciple. \u2026But until Pauli\u2019s visit, Heisenberg had\nremained convinced that \u2026 the Correspondence Principle would\nbring results. (Serwer 1977, p. 222)\n\n\nDespite the fact that Heisenberg relied heavily on the correspondence\nprinciple in developing matrix mechanics, he no longer publicly\ndefended\n it.[9]\n Indeed as Mara Beller has noted, \u201cHeisenberg does not cite\nBohr\u2019s work at all [in the 1925 matrix mechanics paper], despite\nthe fact that the paper was built on Bohr\u2019s correspondence\nprinciple in a fundamental way\u2026 Instead Heisenberg\n[inaccurately] presented his work as flowing from the positivist\nprinciple of elimination of unobservables\u201d (Beller 1999, p.\n 140).[10]\n Heisenberg expresses his increasing ambivalence towards the\ncorrespondence principle in his book The Physical Principles of\nthe Quantum Theory:\n\nIt is true that an ingenious combination of arguments based on the\ncorrespondence principle can make the quantum theory of matter\ntogether with a classical theory of radiation furnish quantitative\nvalues for the transition probabilities\u2026 Such a formulation of\nthe radiation problem is far from satisfactory, however, and easily\nleads to false conclusions. (Heisenberg 1930, p. 82)\n\n\nWhile Heisenberg is willing to admit the limited utility of the\nprinciple, he does not view it as a fundamental principle of quantum\ntheory the way that Bohr does. Instead Heisenberg argues that\n\u201c[i]t must be emphasized that this [correspondence] is a purely\nformal result; it does not follow from any of the physical principles\nof quantum theory\u201d (Heisenberg 1930, p. 83). In other words, the\ncorrespondence is to be interpreted as a purely mathematical result,\nnot as revealing any deep connection between the quantum and classical\ntheories, and certainly not as a principle of quantum theory itself.\nFor Heisenberg, quantum mechanics is a closed theory\n[Abgeschlossene Theorie], an axiomatic system complete in\nitself, not one that in any way depends on classical\n mechanics.[11]\n5. Interpretations in the History and Philosophy Literature\n\nArguably any interpretation of the correspondence principle faces the\nfollowing four challenges: First, determining which (or which\ncombination) of the various analogies or relations between classical\nand quantum mechanics Bohr intended to designate by the correspondence\nprinciple; second, determining the scope of the correspondence\nprinciple (i.e., does it apply only to large quantum numbers or all\nquantum numbers); third, offering an explanation for why Bohr thought\nthat the correspondence principle should be thought of as a\nlaw of quantum theory; and finally, offering an explanation\nfor why Bohr thought that the correspondence principle had been\nformalized, and hence preserved, in modern (matrix) quantum\nmechanics.\n\nOne of the most influential discussions of Bohr\u2019s correspondence\nprinciple appears in Max Jammer\u2019s 1966 book The Conceptual\nDevelopment of Quantum Mechanics. Jammer takes the correspondence\nprinciple to be a relation between the kinematics of the electron and\nthe properties of the emitted radiation. Like many interpreters of the\ncorrespondence principle, he focuses primarily on the frequency\nrelation. He notes that Bohr also found an asymptotic correspondence\nbetween the intensities of the spectral lines and the amplitudes in\nthe classical harmonic components, as well as a correspondence between\nthe polarization of the emitted radiation and the character of the\nclassical motion. Although Jammer notes these other correspondences,\nhe seems to interpret the frequency correspondence as the primary\ncorrespondence principle. Regarding the status of this correspondence\nas a principle, Jammer writes,\n\nIn the limit, therefore, the quantum-theoretic frequency\n\\(\\nu_{qu}\\) coincides with the classical\nmechanical frequency \\(\\nu_{cl}\\). By demanding\nthat this correspondence remain approximately valid also for moderate\nand small quantum numbers, Bohr generalized and modified into a\nprinciple what in the limit may be regarded formally as a theorem.\n(Jammer 1966, p. 111)\n\n\nAccording to Jammer, the correspondence principle, interpreted as the\nfrequency relation, applies by fiat to all quantum numbers and hence\nobtains the status of a \u201cprinciple,\u201d even though it is an\n\u201capproximate\u201d relation that is only exact for large\nquantum numbers.\n\nJammer is rather dismissive of Bohr\u2019s claim that the\ncorrespondence principle should be thought of as a law of quantum\ntheory. He writes,\n\nFor taking resort to classical physics in order to establish\nquantum-theoretic predictions, or in other words, constructing a\ntheory whose corroboration depends on premises which conflict with the\nsubstance of the theory, is of course a serious inconsistency from the\nlogical point of view. Being fully aware of this difficulty, Bohr\nattempted repeatedly to show that \u2018the correspondence principle\nmust be regarded purely as a law of the quantum theory\u2019. (Jammer\n1966, p. 116)\n\n\nOn Jammer\u2019s view, Bohr\u2019s claim that the correspondence\nprinciple is a law is simply an attempt to cover up the inconsistent\nfoundations of the old quantum theory. In opposition to Bohr\u2019s\nclaim that quantum theory is a rational generalization of classical\nmechanics, Jammer interprets Bohr as viewing quantum and classical\nmechanics as irreconcilable, and hence interprets the correspondence\nprinciple as only a \u201cformal analogy of heuristic value.\u201d\nAt the end of his discussion of the correspondence principle, Jammer\nconcludes \u201chis [Bohr\u2019s] numerous and often somewhat\nconflicting statements, made from 1920 to 1961, on the essence of the\ncorrespondence principle make it difficult, if not impossible, to\nascribe to Bohr a clear-cut unvarying conception of the\nprinciple\u201d (Jammer 1966, p. 117).\n\nIt is perhaps for this reason that Jagdish Mehra and Helmut Rechenberg\n(1982), in their comprehensive history of the development of quantum\ntheory, make no concrete commitment as to which of the several\ncorrespondence relations discussed by Bohr should be designated as the\ncorrespondence principle. Like Jammer they struggle to understand why\nBohr thought the correspondence principle applied to small quantum\nnumbers and why it should be considered a law of quantum theory. They\nwrite, \u201c[T]he extension of the analogy \u2018in some way\u2019\nto small quantum numbers represented a most daring assumption\u2026\n[Bohr] felt confident that an extension of his relations for\nfrequencies and intensities, which were valid in the high quantum\nnumber limit, might eventually be justified also when low quantum\nnumbers were involved\u201d (Mehra and Rechenberg 1982, p. 250).\nAlthough they offer one of the more technically detailed discussions\nof the correspondence principle, they do not discuss either\nBohr\u2019s claim that it should be considered a law nor Bohr\u2019s\nclaim that the correspondence principle is formalized into the new\nquantum mechanics.\n\nAn alternative interpretation of Bohr\u2019s correspondence principle\nhas been defended by Olivier Darrigol in his excellent and highly\nreadable history of quantum theory From \\(c\\)-Numbers to\n\\(q\\)-Numbers. Instead of viewing the correspondence\nprinciple as a statement about quantum and classical frequencies, he\ninterprets it as what was earlier called the intensity\ncorrespondence: The quantum transition probability between two\nstationary states separated by \\(\\tau\\) is proportional to the squared\nmodulus of the classical amplitude of the \\(\\tau\\)th harmonic\nvibration, which classically is a measure of the intensity (see\nEquation 5).\n\nDarrigol writes,\n\nBohr assumed that, even for moderately excited states, the probability\nof a given quantum jump was approximately given by the intensity of\nthe \u2018corresponding\u2019 harmonic component of the motion in\nthe initial stationary state. This is what Bohr called \u2018the\ncorrespondence principle\u2019. (Darrigol 1997, p. 550; see also\nDarrigol 1992, p. 126)\n\n\nStrictly speaking this intensity correspondence is exact only in the\nlimit of large quantum numbers, and cannot be extended to small\nquantum numbers. The one exception to this is when the classical\namplitude is zero, the quantum transition probability will also be\nzero (a special case of what was earlier called Bohr\u2019s\nselection rule), which does hold for all quantum numbers.\n\nUnlike some interpreters of the correspondence principle Darrigol does\nbelieve that there is a coherent and rational account of Bohr\u2019s\ncorrespondence principle in terms of the intensity correspondence. He\nargues that Bohr is justified in calling it a law of quantum\ntheory because \u201c[i]t was indeed a relation between two\nquantum theoretical concepts: the probability of a quantum jump, and\natomic motion\u201d (Darrigol 1997, p. 553). Moreover, Darrigol\ncogently argues that this correspondence was incorporated directly\ninto matrix mechanics in Heisenberg\u2019s 1925 paper, thus\nvindicating Bohr\u2019s claim that the new quantum mechanics can be\nregarded as \u201ca precise formulation of the tendencies embodied in\nthe correspondence principle\u201d (Bohr 1925, p. 852; BCW 5, p.\n280).\n\nDespite this continuity, Darrigol argues that there was a fundamental,\nthough implicit, shift in Bohr\u2019s understanding of the\ncorrespondence principle:\n\nOriginally, the motion to which the \u2018correspondence\u2019 was\napplied was the motion in stationary states, formally described by the\norbiting electrons. In the end, this motion had nothing to do with the\ndescription of stationary states, it was purely\n\u2018symbolic.\u2019 (Darrigol 1997, p. 558)\n\n\nBy \u2018formally\u2019 Darrigol means that the space-time relations\nand dynamical relations were retained in the description of the\nelectron\u2019s motion of the atom, although it was recognized that\nthere was no possibility of actually observing this motion. Once it\nbecame a \u2018symbolic\u2019 relation, the space-time description\nwas lost completely.\n\nHans Radder has also argued that Bohr\u2019s understanding of the\ncorrespondence principle evolved over his career. Radder (1991)\nidentifies three different phases. In the first phase (from about 1913\nto 1915) the correspondence principle was merely a \u201cnumerical\ncorrespondence\u201d; that is, it concerned a numerical agreement of\nthe values of certain quantities in classical mechanics (and\nelectrodynamics) and the old quantum theory. In the second phase,\nlasting between 1916 and 1922, the correspondence principle was not\njust a numerical agreement but involved a conceptual continuity as\nwell: \u201cThe same fundamental concepts \\(\\omega_{n,\\tau}\\) and\n\\(C_{n,\\tau}\\), which govern the motion of the electrons in their\norbits, and the same function \\(f\\) determining the transition\nprobabilities are claimed to underlie both kinds of theory\u201d\n(Radder 1991, p. 206). In the third phase from 1923 until 1925 when\nthe new matrix (quantum) mechanics was introduced, the conceptual\ncontinuity was abandoned in favor of a \u201cformal\u201d\ncorrespondence. Radder means something different than Darrigol when he\ndescribes the correspondence principle as \u201cformal.\u201d He\nexplains,\n\nNow conceptual correspondence, linked as it was to the mechanical\norbital model was rejected as a basis for atomic theory and the\norbital model was provisionally replaced by the so-called\n\u2018virtual field model\u2019\u2026 [T]hese relations between\nterms are formal (not conceptual) correspondences,\nexpressing the existence of certain relations of mathematical identity\nor substitution. (Radder 1991, p. 207)\n\n\nRadder\u2019s chief concern is relating the various incarnations of\nBohr\u2019s correspondence principle to the more general\ncorrespondence and heuristics arguments in the philosophy of science\nliterature (see Section 7 below).\n\nOther recent interpretations of Bohr\u2019s correspondence principle\ninclude Robert Batterman\u2019s, according to which \u201cthe CP is\na statement to the effect that the radiative processes to which the\nsecond postulate \\([h\\nu = E' - E'']\\) applies are\n\u2018correlated\u2019 with, or \u2018correspond\u2019 to,\nmechanical vibrations or periodic motions of the charged particles,\nthe electrons, in the atom\u201d (Batterman 1991, p. 203). Batterman\nrightly notes that the correspondence principle is not the claim that\nquantum mechanics must contain classical mechanics as a limiting case,\nand argues that the asymptotic agreement of classical and quantum\nfrequencies (the frequency interpretation) is not the correspondence\nprinciple, but rather something that is justified and\nexplained by the correspondence principle.\n\nSimilarly, Scott Tanona (2004) rejects the view that Bohr\u2019s\ncorrespondence principle is about an asymptotic agreement of quantum\nand classical theories. He argues instead that Bohr\u2019s\ncorrespondence principle should be understood primarily as a\nconnection between spectra (radiation) and orbital motion. More\nbroadly, Tanona argues that the correspondence principle should not be\nunderstood as a heuristic tool for theory construction, but rather as\nan epistemological tool, whose \u201cmain purpose within Bohr\u2019s\nempirical approach was to bridge the epistemological gap between\nempirical phenomena and the unknown atomic structure \u2026 by\nassociating classical properties of spectra with atomic\nproperties\u201d (Tanona 2004, p. 683).\n\nMore recently, Alisa Bokulich (2008, and 2009 [Other Internet\nResources]) has argued that Bohr\u2019s correspondence principle\nshould be understood in terms of what she calls Bohr\u2019s\nselection rule. This selection rule states that \u201cthe\ntransition from a stationary state \\(n'\\) to another\nstationary state \\(n''\\) is allowed if and only if\nthere exists a \\(\\tau\\)th harmonic in the classical motion of\nthe electron in the stationary state; if there is no\n\\(\\tau\\)th harmonic in the classical motion, then transitions\nbetween stationary states whose separation is \\(\\tau\\) are not allowed\nquantum mechanically\u201d (Bokulich 2008, p. 85). Thus, the\ncorrespondence principle, on this reading of Bohr, is defined as the\nstatement that each allowed quantum transition between stationary\nstates corresponds to one harmonic component of the classical motion.\nShe argues that the asymptotic agreements of frequencies and\nintensities emphasized by Jammer and Darrigol respectively are\napplications or consequences of the correspondence principle,\nbut not the correspondence principle itself. Moreover, she argues that\nthe selection rule interpretation of Bohr\u2019s correspondence\nprinciple best makes sense of Bohr\u2019s claims that the\ncorrespondence principle applies to small \\(n\\), that it is a law\nof quantum theory, and that it is formalized and preserved in matrix\nmechanics.\n6. Interpretations in the Current Physics Literature\n\nOne typically finds a very different understanding of Bohr\u2019s\ncorrespondence principle in the current physics literature. Even as\nearly as Max Born\u2019s classic text on the new quantum\n theory,[12]\n first published in 1933, one finds the correspondence principle\ndefined as follows:\n\nThe leading idea (Bohr\u2019s correspondence principle,\n1923) may be stated broadly as follows. Judged by the test of\nexperience, the laws of classical physics have brilliantly justified\nthemselves in all processes of motion\u2026 It must therefore be\nlaid down as an unconditionally necessary postulate, that the new\nmechanics \u2026 must in all these problems reach the same results\nas the classical mechanics. In other words, it must be demanded that,\nfor the limiting cases of large masses and of orbits of large\ndimensions, the new mechanics passes over into classical mechanics.\n(Born [1933] 1957, p. 103).\n\n\nThere are two strands to Born\u2019s rereading of Bohr\u2019s\ncorrespondence principle that have become quite common in the physics\nliterature: first, the correspondence principle as a very general\nrequirement that quantum mechanics ought to be able to recover the\nempirical successes of classical mechanics; and, second, the more\nspecific requirement that it recover the predictions of classical\nmechanics in the limit of large masses and orbits of large\ndimension\u2014this latter limit is typically expressed as \\(n\n\\rightarrow \\infty\\).\n\nIn David Bohm\u2019s classic textbook on standard quantum mechanics,\nthe correspondence principle is similarly interpreted as a general\nrelation between the two theories: \u201c[T]he correspondence\nprinciple, which was first given by Bohr \u2026 states that the laws\nof quantum physics must be so chosen that in the classical limit,\nwhere many quanta are involved, the quantum laws lead to the classical\nequations as an average\u201d (Bohm 1951, p. 31).\n\nIn his 1984 Physics Today article \u201cThe Correspondence\nPrinciple Revisited,\u201d Richard Liboff argues that Bohr\u2019s\ncorrespondence principle is not a general claim about recovering\nclassical mechanics from quantum mechanics, but the following more\nrestricted claim: \u201cthe quantum frequency spectrum of a periodic\nsystem approaches the classical spectrum in the limit of large\n\\(n\\)\u201d (Liboff 1984, p. 52). Liboff goes on to note that even\nthis restricted form of the correspondence principle is violated for\nsystems such as a particle in a box and a rigid rotor. He notes that\n\u201c[i]n both of these cases, the limit \\(h \\rightarrow 0\\) leads\nto frequency correspondence, but the limit \\(n \\rightarrow \\infty\\)\ndoes not\u201d (Liboff 1984, p. 52).\n\nFollowing on Liboff, Ghazi Hassoun and Donald Kobe (1989) have argued\nthat in order to obtain a meaningful classical limit of quantum\nmechanical eigenvalues it is necessary that \u201cboth formulations\n[of the correspondence principle] are used concurrently in the sense\nthat the Planck constant goes to zero and the appropriate quantum\nnumber goes to infinity \u2026 subject to the constraint that \\(nh =\nJ\\), where \\(J\\) is the appropriate classical action\u201d (Hassoun\nand Kobe 1989, p. 658). On this reading, Bohr\u2019s correspondence\nprinciple is construed simply as the limit \\(n \\rightarrow\n\\infty\\). Although they call this limit \u201cBohr\u2019s\ncorrespondence principle\u201d, they note that Bohr was able to\nobtain the correct classical orbital frequency precisely\n\u201cbecause he did not take the mathematical limit as the quantum\nnumber goes to infinity. Instead, Bohr considered that for large\nquantum numbers the quantum result was very nearly the classical\nresult. Thus the quantum number \\(n\\), say, was \\(n \\gg 1\\), but was\nnot infinite\u201d (Hassoun and Kobe 1989, p.  661). They conclude\nthat the correspondence principle is \u201coften thought to be\nimprecise because of Bohr\u2019s use of large, but not infinite,\nquantum numbers. However, when the Bohr and Planck formulations are\nsynthesized, as shown in this article, the correspondence principle\nhas a precise mathematical form\u201d (Hassoun and Kobe 1989,\np. 661). The correspondence principle on this reading is understood\nbroadly as the attempt to get a mathematically precise formulation of\nthe classical limit.\n\nMuch of the contemporary physics community\u2019s interest in\nBohr\u2019s correspondence principle (variously understood) is in\nprima facie violations of this principle by particular classes of\nphysical systems. For example, Joseph Ford and Giorgio Mantica, in\ntheir article, \u201cDoes Quantum Mechanics Obey the Correspondence\nPrinciple? Is It Complete?\u201d define the correspondence principle\nas requiring that \u201cany two valid physical theories which have an\noverlap in their domains of validity must, to relevant accuracy, yield\nthe same predictions for physical observations\u201d (Ford and\nMantica 1992, p. 1087). Their concern is whether quantum mechanics can\naccount for the behavior of chaotic classical systems. Similarly,\nWojciech Zurek defines the correspondence principle as a demand for an\nagreement between the \u201cquantum and classical expectation\nvalues\u201d (Habib et al. 1998), arguing that without the phenomenon\nof decoherence, the correspondence principle is violated.\n\nWhile the contemporary physics literature\u2019s understanding of the\ncorrespondence principle is largely in line with Max Born\u2019s\nconstrual of this principle (given above), it was not what Bohr\nhimself meant by the correspondence principle. Although Bohr agreed\nthat quantum mechanics ought to be able to recover the empirically\nconfirmed predictions of classical mechanics, he explicitly rejected\nthis reading of the correspondence principle. Indeed L\u00e9on\nRosenfeld recounts Bohr\u2019s frustration at the continued\nmisunderstanding of his principle. When Rosenfeld off-handedly\nsuggested to Bohr that the correspondence principle was about the\nasymptotic agreement of quantum and classical predictions, Bohr\nemphatically protested and replied, \u201cIt is not the\ncorrespondence argument. The requirement that the quantum theory\nshould go over to the classical description for low modes of\nfrequency, is not at all a principle. It is an obvious requirement for\nthe theory\u201d (Rosenfeld 1973, p. 690).\n7. Generalized Correspondence Principle\n\nFinally, it is important to distinguish between Bohr\u2019s\ncorrespondence principle and what some philosophers of science have\nreferred to as the \u201cgeneralized correspondence principle\u201d\n(alternately the \u201cgeneral correspondence principle\u201d).\n\nIn his classic essay \u201cCorrespondence, Invariance and Heuristics:\nIn Praise of Conservative Induction\u201d Heinz Post defines this\nprinciple as follows:\n\nThe most important heuristic restriction is the General\nCorrespondence Principle. Roughly speaking, this is the\nrequirement that any acceptable new theory \\(L\\) should account\nfor the success of its predecessor \\(S\\) by\n\u2018degenerating\u2019 into that theory under those conditions\nunder which \\(S\\) has been well confirmed by tests. (Post 1971,\np. 228)\n\n\nThe generalized correspondence principle here is seen both as a\nconstraint on the development of new theories and as an account of how\nsuccessor theories are related to their predecessors. Typically in\nphysics, Post\u2019s notion of \u2018degenerating\u2019 is cashed\nout as the limit of some parameter whereby the equations of a\nsuccessor theory are recovered as the limit of the equations of\npredecessor theory. Regarding the specific case of the\nquantum-classical relation, Post argues that the general\ncorrespondence principle fails:\n\nParadoxically, the only counterexample we have been able to find to\nthe General Correspondence Principle is the paradigm example of the\nrelation of quantum mechanics to classical mechanics. Contrary to the\nimpression that may be given in some textbooks, it is not possible to\nreduce quantum to classical mechanics\u2026 This failure to\nestablish a general correspondence between quantum mechanics and\nclassical physics (in the limit where\n\\(\\Delta P\\Delta Q \\gg h\\) should in our\nview be regarded as a shortcoming of quantum mechanics \u2026 in its\nclaim to the status of \\(L\\)-theory, rather than as a breakdown\nof the General Correspondence Principle. (Post 1971, pp.\n233\u2013234)[13]\n\n\nAlthough Post\u2019s generalized correspondence principle bears some\nsimilarity to the physicist\u2019s conception of Bohr\u2019s\ncorrespondence principle, it is quite different from Bohr\u2019s own\nunderstanding. Indeed, according to Post, the generalized\ncorrespondence principle does not even hold for the specific theory\npair that was Bohr\u2019s subject.\n\nIn contrast to Post, Radder (1991) has claimed that the generalized\ncorrespondence principle does apply to the case of the\nquantum-classical relation (p. 215), and that Bohr\u2019s\ncorrespondence principle, which he interprets largely as a heuristic\ntool, can be seen as an instance of the generalized correspondence\nprinciple (p. 208).\n",
