While\nmost of the thinkers and ideas are from the classical period of Islam\n(ca. 800\u20131300) in a few cases we have extended our survey to the\nseventeenth century to include influential post-classical thinkers,\nlike Mulla \u1e62adr\u0101. Despite this limitation, the period\ncovered was one of the most intellectually robust periods in the\ndevelopment of Islamic philosophy of religion. While most of the\ntopics covered in this entry are common to philosophy of\nreligion\u2014such as the existence of God, God\u2019s relation to\nthe cosmos, the issue of evil and the like\u2014Muslims and those\nunder the influence of Islam frequently imprinted these issues with\ntheir own unique stamp. Such unique moments include the thoroughly\ndeveloped occasionalism of Muslim theologians, the development by\nphilosophers and theologians of a Necessary Being theology and even\nframing the problem of evil differently from the one frequently seen\namong contemporary western philosophers of religion.\n",

    "main_text": "\n1. Faith and Reason\n\nA foundational question in the philosophy of religion concerns the\nrelation between faith and reason. As with perhaps all religions, the\nspectrum of Muslim responses is broad. Before looking at these\nresponses, it is important to note that \u2018reason\u2019 is used\nin two distinct senses. In one sense, reason refers to the ability,\npower or faculty by which we understand, judge and explain things.\nReason in this sense corresponds with our intellect\n(\u02bfaql). In a second sense, reason refers to the\nphilosophical and scientific explanations and theories about the\nthings that the intellect understands, judges and explains. In this\nsense, reason corresponds with science or philosophy. Analogously,\n\u2018faith\u2019 has at least two meanings. In one sense, it may\nrefer to an epistemic notion and mean to believe or to trust in\nsomething, perhaps uncritically (taql\u012bd), usually based\non the authority of some (religious) source. In a second sense, faith\nmay refer to a particular religion, understood as the body of\nknowledge encompassed in one\u2019s sacred scriptures and religious\ntraditions as in the sense of the \u2018Islamic faith\u2019. These\ndifferent senses of reason and faith in turn give rise to no less than\nthree distinct questions concerning what the relation between faith\nand reason is:\n\nWhat role, if any, does the unaided human intellect play in\nacquiring religious knowledge?\nWhat role, if any, does the intellect play in justifying specific\nbeliefs?\nHow should one reconcile conflicts between one\u2019s religious\nbelief and the finding of one\u2019s best science or philosophical\nsystem?\n\n\nAs one may expect, these questions were raised and debated in the\nIslamicate world.\n1.1 Reason and religious knowledge\n\nThe first way that the faith-reason question may be understood\ninvolves the extent, if any, to which the unaided human intellect can\ndiscover the various claims of a religion, whether theological or\nethical. In answer to this question, Muslim philosophers and\ntheologians defended three major positions. One is that unaided human\nreason is sufficient to reach true knowledge about what can (or needs\nto) be known about God and our moral duties. A second position is that\nunaided reason can discover at least the basic claims of a religion,\nlike God exists and is absolutely perfect, but this basic knowledge\nmust be augmented by truths that only a prophet can provide. The third\nposition is that human reason cannot reach the knowledge that religion\nprovides, and so a religious source is required for true knowledge\nabout God and what God demands of us.\n\nA purported representative of the first position is the physician and\nphilosopher Ab\u016b Bakr al-R\u0101z\u012b (865\u2013925; see entry\non\n al-R\u0101z\u012b).\n He is reported to have held that human reason is sufficient to\nunderstand all that is necessary for a devout life, and thus scripture\nis at best superfluous and at worse deceptive and a source of\ndissension (A. H. R\u0101z\u012b Proofs of Prophecy: 2.1 and\n5.1, pp. 24\u20136 & 131\u20134). This is an extreme\n position.[1]\n At the other extreme some Muslim scholars in general dismissed the\nuse of unaided reason in religious matters. There must be religious\nauthority in the form of a prophet who teaches others what they should\nknow about God and who establishes rules that must be observed in\nindividual and social life. Such a position not only dismissed\nindependent reasoning about one\u2019s religion, but also discouraged\nmetaphorical interpretations of sacred writ. Between these extremes,\nMuslim philosophers and theologians believed that while there is a\nplace for unaided reason in acquiring certain religious beliefs, a\nneed for scripture is also essential to that understanding, albeit\nthey disagreed about the nature and extent of that need. Let us begin\nwith the position of most of the Muslim philosophers.\n\nPhilosophers most generally defended the view that at least\nindividuals of sufficient intellect could independently acquire a\nknowledge of all the fundamental claims of religion.They maintained\nthat non-philosophers who constitute the majority of people, in\ncontrast, must rely on religious sources. Those sources, however, the\nphilosophers continue, ultimately agree with what can be rationally\nknown, albeit in a way that describes philosophically correct views in\nmetaphors and symbols so as to be accessible to the masses. One may\ninclude al-F\u0101r\u0101b\u012b (d. 950), Ibn S\u012bn\u0101 (or\nAvicenna, d. 1037), Ibn \u1e6cufayl (d. 1185) and Ibn Rushd (or\nAverroes, d. 1198) among these philosophers.\n\nF\u0101r\u0101b\u012b appears to be the originator of the general view\nof the Muslim philosophers (F\u0101r\u0101b\u012b Perfect\nState: 276\u201385 & al-Milla & b, \u00b6\u00b6\n4\u20136). Humans divided into three classes based on their\nintellectual capacities. One class is persuaded of divine truths\nsolely on the basis of demonstrative proofs. These proofs produce a\nbelief that is certain and are discovered independent of scripture.\nThe second class is persuaded on the basis of dialectical proofs.\nThese proofs produce a belief that is highly probable, and so\nscripture is necessary to confirm the true beliefs and correct any\nfalse ones. The final and the most numerous class consists of those\nwho are easily persuaded by rhetorical proofs involving images that\nhold out threats of torment for non-belief and promises of pleasures\nfor belief. Scripture is of most use for this class, for it provides a\nsimplified version of the religious truths necessary for a devout\nlife, but now put into a language that captures the imagination of\neven the most dull-witted. Thus, F\u0101r\u0101b\u012b\u2019s\nposition has two elements:\n\nthe truths relevant to religion can be rationally known, and\nyet\nreligious authority is also needed, albeit not by all.\n\n\nF\u0101r\u0101b\u012b\u2019s view can be found in Ibn\n\u1e6cufayl\u2019s philosophical novel \u1e24ayy ibn\nYaq\u1e93\u0101n (HIY, especially 161\u20135). The novel\nrelates the story of a child raised by a deer on a desert island, and\nwhat he was able to learn through unaided reason, and then his\nsubsequent encounter with a religious community. The story concludes\nwith the protagonist resigning himself to the fact that some people do\nnot want to be intellectually challenged. Ibn Rushd also endorses\nF\u0101r\u0101b\u012b\u2019s tripartite division of humanity in his\nlegal treatise, The Decisive Treatise (Ibn Rushd\nDecisive: 1\u201312, esp. 8).\n\nSome theologians gave a similar, but different, answer to this\nquestion. They asked whether one who is mentally sound and has reached\nthe age of discernment is accountable before God for their religious\nbeliefs and practices, even if they have never heard the message of\nIslam. Answering this question, the Mu\u02bftazilite theologian,\nal-Q\u0101d\u012b \u02bfAbd al-Jabb\u0101r (d. 1025) and Ab\u016b\nMan\u1e63\u016br al-M\u0101tur\u012bd\u012b (d. 944), the eponymous\nfounder of the M\u0101tur\u012bd\u012b school of theology, held that\nindividuals at the age of discernment are responsible in believing,\nfor example, that God exists, that God is just, that God sends\nmessengers, that there is life after death and that one should lead a\nmorally good life (\u02bfAbd al-Jabb\u0101r SUK: 62\u20138,\n122\u20134, 563\u20136 and M\u0101tur\u012bd\u012b KT: 3\u20137,\n156\u201362; also see Hourani 1971: 129\u201339). A common position\namong later M\u0101tur\u012bd\u012b and Ash\u02bfar\u012b theologians\nslightly modified this view: In addition to the fundamental truths\nabout God and his relation to the world just mentioned, human reason\ncan verify that Muhammad was a genuine prophet. Having verified\nMuhammad\u2019s prophecy, one now can go on to endorse all the claims\nrevealed in the Qur\u2019an, which is different than merely\n\u2018believing by faith\u2019 (taql\u012bd) since the\nacceptance of the Quranic claims are grounded in an initial proof for\nthe veracity of the Qur\u2019an as a revelatory source of knowledge\n(Nasaf\u012b TA: II 12\u201328; Juwayn\u012b Proofs,\n165\u20137; Ghaz\u0101l\u012b Moderation, treatises\n3\u20134; also see Frank 1989).\n1.2 The role of reason in justifying specific beliefs\n\nThe first faith-reason issue concerned the role, if any, of unaided\nreason in understanding general religious claims. The second issue\nconcerns the role of reason relative to a specific religion and has\ntwo parts: (1) the role of reason in having a justified belief in\none\u2019s specific religion, like Islam, and (2) the role of reason\nin interpreting a specific religion\u2019s sacred sources. As one\nmight expect, this second set of issues is closely tied to the first.\nConsequently, the various responses to the second issue frequently\nmirror those to the first, albeit with additional nuances.\n1.2.1 Reason and justified religious beliefs\n\nMuslim philosophers and Mu\u02bftazilite theologians, might broadly be\ndescribed as evidentialists. They held that reason, in the form of\nrational first principles or proofs based upon them, is essential for\njustified beliefs, even those found in religion, although in nuanced\nways. As for the philosophers, only those who have demonstrative\nproofs of their beliefs are rationally and truly justified in those\nbeliefs. As for non-philosophers, insofar as they accept a\n\u2018true\u2019 religion\u2014i.e., one that the philosopher would\naccept on the basis of demonstration\u2014and they do so based upon\neither highly probably opinions or images from sacred texts that\nsymbolically capture truths that philosophers demonstrate, members of\nthese other two classes are likewise justified, to the extent that\nthey can be, in their beliefs.\n\nIn addition to knowledge of certain general religious claims, some\nMu\u02bftazilite theologians extended this general knowledge to\nspecific credal beliefs (Frank 1978, esp. 124\u20139). Their strategy\nwas to observe that having come to recognize that God exists and has\ncertain attributes, one should further speculate about what God wants\nfrom us. This speculation leads to certain general ethical axioms;\nhowever, more importantly, it leads to the belief that such a wise and\npowerful being would send a messenger, that is, a prophet, to make the\ndivine intentions known. Once one has reached this point, one would be\nmotivated to seek out self-proclaimed prophets and test them. Upon\nhaving tested a prophet and identifying them as a true prophet, then\nanything based upon that prophetic message would also be rationally\njustified.\n\nMuslim theologians who denied or limited the role of reason were\npresented with a problem. Muslim philosophers and Mu\u02bftazilite\ntheologians maintained, to varying degrees, something like the\nfollowing Evidentialist Premise:\n\n(EP)\nOne is rationally justified in one\u2019s belief (as opposed to\nbelieving out of fear, believing arbitrarily or even because it is\nabsurd) if and only if one has a reason for that belief that appeals\nto the human intellectual capacity to acquire the truth about the\nsubject of that belief.\n\n\nThe philosophers and certain theologians leveled a challenge against\nthe Ash\u02bfarites, Maturidites and more traditional theologians like\nA\u1e25mad Ibn \u1e24anbal (d. 855). Since with few exceptions these\nlatter held that reason is limited in its capacity to acquire those\ntruths or even is incapable, these thinkers either cannot be\nrationally justified in their beliefs or at best they are only\npartially justified. Moreover, if one holds a belief without some\nrational justification, it appears as if one holds that belief\narbitrarily or even irrationally.\n\nThere were varying responses to this challenge. At the core of these\nresponses, often, is simply a denial of (EP). The theologians\u2019\ndenial, however, is not obviously arbitrary or irrational, as they\nnote, since (EP) assumes that humans have the intellectual capacity to\nacquire the truth about either general or specific religious beliefs,\nand yet this issue is the very one at stake. In some cases, these\ntheologians suggested alternative models of justification. For\nexample, Im\u0101m al-\u1e24aramayn al-Juwayn\u012b (d. 1085) appears\nto have had a coherentist theory of justification, at least with\nrespect to prophecy (Juwayn\u012b Proofs, 165\u20137; also\nsee Siddiqui 2019: ch. 4). For Juwayn\u012b, while reason alone is\nunable to acquire the tenets of Islam, that inability does not make\nthose tenets irrational, in the sense of being contrary to reason;\nrather, upon hearing the tenets, one determines that they are at least\ncoherent in which case one is justified in believing them.\n1.2.2 Reason and interpreting (ta\u02bew\u012bl) religious sources\n\nThe second aspect to the question of what role reason plays in\njustifying specific beliefs concerns hermeneutics, namely, what is the\nrole of reason in interpreting one\u2019s own sacred sources, like\nthe Qur\u2019an and sayings of the prophet Muhammad? Within the\ncontext of Islam, the issue is whether a Muslim must take the\nQur\u2019an and prophetic traditions at face-value or should use\ncertain interpretative tools, such as metaphorical readings and\nanalogical reasoning, when approaching scripture and prophetic\nsayings. On one side, there are positions like that of\nF\u0101r\u0101b\u012b. True religious beliefs are the symbolic\nexpressions of the philosophical truths that philosophy and science\nprovide. Hence when there is a divergence between philosophical\ntheories and religious teachings, one should keep in mind that\nreligious texts are not literal expressions of the truth and perhaps\nmore like \u2018noble lies\u2019 (F\u0101r\u0101b\u012b Perfect\nState: 276\u201385). On the other side of this issue, there is\nthe legal theorist Ibn \u1e24anbal, who is usually associated with\nthe position that only the Qur\u2019an and the sayings of Muhammad\nare sufficient and necessary for an intellectually complete\nunderstanding of God, the world and our place in it. Moreover, one\nmust simply accept the claims of these sources as literally true, even\nthe most anthropomorphic ones about God and the divine attributes,\nsuch as those about the hands of God, God\u2019s speech and that God\nis seated or established on the Throne. Between these two positions\nthere were a host of intermediate views.\n\nFor example, the Ash\u02bfar\u012bte theologian, Ab\u016b\n\u1e24\u0101mid al-Ghaz\u0101l\u012b (d. 1111), made room for a\nmetaphorical interpretation (ta\u02bew\u012bl) of certain\npassage from the Qur\u2019an and the sayings of the prophets. In\nparticular Ghaz\u0101l\u012b maintained that literal anthropomorphic\ndescriptions of God, particularly ones ascribing to God a body, had to\nbe rejected and interpreted metaphorically. Thus, in On Moderation\nof Belief (I, 8), he divides Muslims into the general public and\nthe scholars. The general public should be disabused of any\nanthropomorphic reading of God in the Qur\u2019an, and if they ask\nwhat such verses and sayings mean, they simply should be told it is\nnot theirs to investigate such matter. In contrast, Ghaz\u0101l\u012b\ncontinues, it is suitable for the scholar to pursue and to understand\nmetaphorically Qur\u2019anic passages, such as \u201cThe Merciful is\nseated/established on (istaw\u0101 \u02bfal\u0101) the\nThrown\u201d (20:5, trans. by authors), which suggest that God has a\nbody or at least is localized in some specific place. For\nGhaz\u0101l\u012b it is unthinkable that the Qur\u2019an could\ncontain contradictions, and yet he believes that he can rationally\nprove that anything bodily must be subject to temporal becoming,\nwhereas God cannot be subject to temporal becoming. Consequently, for\nGhaz\u0101l\u012b no bodily state can literally be ascribed of God on\npain of contradiction and yet again the Qur\u2019an is free of any\ncontradiction. In general, Ghaz\u0101l\u012b claims that any religious\nclaims that \u201cthe intellect judges impossible\u201d (m\u0101\nqa\u1e0d\u0101 al-\u02bfaql bi-isti\u1e25\u0101latihi) must be\ninterpreted metaphorically.\n\nIronically, the philosopher Ibn Rushd, who was a critic of\nGhaz\u0101l\u012b, shared a similar view. In his legal work the\nDecisive Treatise (Ibn Rushd Decisive: \u00a7III.B),\nhe notes that Islamic religious sources either treat some given\nsubject of a demonstration or they do not. If the religion does not\nspeak to a given subject, the demonstrated conclusion should not be a\nmatter of religious dispute and one is free to hold the position. If\nthe Islamic sources do treat a given subject of demonstration, then\nthe two either agree or disagree. If they agree, then again there\nshould be no religious dispute. If, however, there is a disagreement\nbetween the literal sense of the religious sources and the conclusion\nof a demonstration, then those intellectually capable can apply\nmetaphorical interpretation to reconcile the conflict.\n\nThe issue is how to determine which Qur\u2019anic passages and\nprophetic statements must be taken literally and which ones\nmetaphorically. Ibn Rushd\u2019s view concerning theoretical matters\ntreated in religion, though not in practical and ethical issues, is\nthat there simply is no consensus (ijm\u0101\u02bf). Muslim\nscholars, for Ibn Rushd, simply do not universally agree as to which\nscriptures and traditions must be taken literally and which can be\ntaken metaphorically. Hence, there is no religious basis for\nprecluding metaphorical interpretation of any text or prophetic saying\ntreating theoretical issues whose apparent meaning conflicts with a\ndemonstration. The only obligation on the religious scholar is that he\nmust not share metaphorical interpretations of sacred sources with\nthose who are incapable of grasping a demonstration. The greatest\nproponent of Islamic philosophical mysticism, Ibn \u02bfArab\u012b (d.\n1240), also shared this inclusive view of scripture\u2019s intended\nmeaning. For him, every word, verse and chapter of the Qur\u2019an\nhave an indefinite number of senses and interpretations, and God\nintended all of them. Thus, in the Meccan Revelations, he\nwrites,\n\n\nWhen a meaning repeats itself for someone who is reciting the\nQur\u2019an, he has not recited it as it should be. This is proof of\nhis ignorance. (cited in Chittick 2005: 18 = (Ibn al-\u02bfArab\u012b\nal-Fut\u016b\u1e25\u0101t\n\nal-Makkiyya (a), IV, 367.3)\n\n1.3 Conflicts between religious teachings and science/philosophy\n\nThe third faith-reason issue involves responses to apparent conflicts\nbetween the teachings of one\u2019s specific religion and the\npurported demonstrated conclusions of one\u2019s best science or\nphilosophical account. At the heart of this issue is the notion of\ndemonstration (burh\u0101n). A demonstration proceeds from\npurportedly absolutely certain, necessary and true first principles\nfrom which one validly deduces some conclusion. Since the conclusion\nvalidly follows from purportedly absolutely certain, necessary and\ntrue premises, the conclusion is likewise absolutely certain,\nnecessary and true (see F\u0101r\u0101b\u012b\u2019s account of\ncertainty = MR07: 63\u20136; also see Black 2006). Since, for the\nphilosophers, the conclusions of demonstration are certain and\nnecessarily true, any claim apparently contradicting a demonstrated\nconclusion cannot be literally true. Yet, within Islamic authoritative\nsources there are claims that are at odds with some of the\nphilosophers\u2019 purported demonstrative conclusions. Few Muslim\nphilosophers were willing to say that the Qur\u2019an and the sayings\nof the prophets are simply false. Instead, many philosophers appealed\nto their epistemic hierarchy of human intellectual capacities seen\nabove. For them, both Islamic religious sources and demonstrated\nconclusion at heart express the same truth, although expressed\ndifferently depending upon the intended audience.\n\nEven if some theologians recognized the difficulty with taking all\nreligious statements literally, there still was pushback against the\nphilosophers and particularly their unquestioning faith in\n\u2018demonstrative\u2019 conclusions. Thus, several Muslim\ntheologians, like Ghaz\u0101l\u012b, \u02bfAbd al-Kar\u012bm\nShahrast\u0101n\u012b (d. 1153) and Fakhr al-D\u012bn\nal-R\u0101z\u012b (d. 1210), to name a few, took it upon themselves to\nfamiliarize themselves with the philosophers\u2019 demonstrative\nmethod and show that even by the philosophers\u2019 own standards\nthey had not demonstrated their conclusions.\n\nGhaz\u0101l\u012b\u2019s Incoherence of the Philosophers\n(Tah\u0101fut al-fal\u0101sifa) provides an excellent example\nof this approach. There he vigorously criticizes the\nphilosophers\u2019 attempts to demonstrate twenty\nphilosophical-theological theses, arguing that in all cases the proofs\nfall short of true demonstration. His strategy is to call into\nquestion the supposedly self-evident, certain and necessary character\nof the premises used in the philosophers\u2019 proofs. He does so by\narguing that either those premises fail to have these characteristics\nand so are not first principles or, if a premise is not a first\nprinciple, the philosophers have failed to demonstrate the\npremise\u2019s necessity. While Ghaz\u0101l\u012b believes that on at\nleast three counts the philosophers\u2019 positions lead to unbelief,\non several other issues he accepts the conclusion of the philosophers\neven while denying their demonstrative character.\n\nGhaz\u0101l\u012b\u2019s general concern in both the\nIncoherence and other works where he criticizes the\nphilosophers is their claim to having demonstrated truths of religion\nindependent of sacred sources. That is because this position,\ncomplains Ghaz\u0101l\u012b, has led some of those with lesser\nintellects to accept the philosophers\u2019 arguments uncritically,\nand so think that they can dispense with religion and religious\nsources (Ghaz\u0101l\u012b Deliverance, 60\u201370,\n83\u20136 and Incoherence, religious preface and\nintroduction 4). Ghaz\u0101l\u012b\u2019s own position is that while\nthere is a duty to provide a rational defense of the basic tenets of\none\u2019s religion, this duty falls only on those intellectually\nsuited and religiously trained and must be prohibited of those who\nlack this training (Ghaz\u0101l\u012b Moderation,\nintroductions 1\u20133).\n2. Proofs for the existence of God (All\u0101h)\n\nAmong the basic religious beliefs that some Muslim theologians and\nphilosophers thought that reason alone could establish is the\nexistence of God. To this end various, Muslim thinkers developed\ndifferent proofs as well as criticisms of each other\u2019s\narguments. Here we consider three such arguments and sets of\nobjections: the argument from temporal coming-to-be, the argument from\nthe nature of necessity and possibility/contingency and the argument\nfrom knowledge by presence.\n2.1 An argument from temporal coming-to-be (hud\u016bth)\n\nMuslim theologians, that is, proponents of kal\u0101m, and even\ncertain philosophers like as Ab\u016b Y\u016bsuf al-Kind\u012b (d. ca.\n866), had several arguments for the existence of God, all of which in\nsome way appeal temporal coming-to-be (see, for example,\nAsh\u02bfar\u012b TAAT: 6\u20138; Juwayn\u012b Proofs,\n9\u201316; Ghaz\u0101l\u012b Moderation, 27\u201341;\nShahrast\u0101n\u012b Summa, 1\u201325) and which fall under\nthe umbrella expression, \u2018kal\u0101m cosmological\nargument\u2019. William Lane Craig has defended and brought to the\nattention of contemporary philosophers of religion the kal\u0101m\ncosmological argument (see section in entry on\n cosmological arguments).\n In its simplest form, the argument runs like this:\n\nEverything that begins to exist after not having\nexisted has a cause for its existence.\nThe world began to exist after not having\nexisted.\nTherefore, the world has a cause for its\nexistence, which is God.\n\n\nPremise (1)\n is just a particular instance of the general principle that nothing\ncomes from nothing. Within the medieval Islamic world, the principle\nis associated with the notion of preponderation\n(tarj\u012b\u1e25), which at least within the context of the\nkal\u0101m cosmological argument, states that for any action, motion\nor change some cause or reason exist for that action or change.\n\nThe more controversial premise is\n (2),\n for unlike the theologians, certain philosophers, like\nF\u0101r\u0101b\u012b, Ibn S\u012bn\u0101 and Ibn Rushd, maintained\nthat the world has existed infinitely into the past. Consequently,\nthese philosophers reject the world\u2019s coming to exist after some\npoint of not having existed. The theologians\u2019 response was\neither simply to claim that the intellect asserts that the existence\nof an infinity is rationally impossible or to show that positing an\ninfinity leads to consequences known to be rationally impossible.\nThose who took the latter strategy drew upon the arguments of the late\nNeoplatonic Christian philosopher, John Philoponus (d. 570; see entry\non\n Philoponus).\n Two examples should provide a sense of the general strategy.\n\nFirst, according to the astronomy of the time, the world consists of\nthe Earth, which was thought to be (approximately) at the center of\nthe cosmos, and the various celestial bodies\u2014the Moon, Sun, five\nvisible planets and stars\u2014that were believed to orbit the Earth.\nNow, assume that the world has existed infinitely into the past. In\nthat case, the various celestial bodies that apparently orbit the\nEarth would have all made an infinite number of revolutions; however,\nthe celestial bodies have different periods. For instance, the Moon\norbits the earth approximately once a month, that is, twelve times a\nyear, while the apparent revolution of the Sun is only once a year.\nConsequently, while the Sun has made an infinite number of apparent\nrevolutions around the Earth, the Moon has made twelve times the\nrotations of the Sun, that is, twelve times infinity, and so seemingly\na greater number than that of the Sun. Since it is assumed that there\nis nothing greater than infinity, reason recoils at the notion of a\nnumber greater than that which nothing is greater. The theologians,\nthen, conclude that the assumption of the world\u2019s existing\ninfinitely into the past leads to absurdity and so must be\nrejected.\n\nPhilosophers who accepted the eternity of the world rejected this\nargument, claiming that the infinity in question is only a potential\ninfinity and not an actual one, that is, one in which all the members\nof an actually infinite set would presently exist. As such, they\ncontinued, there does not exist actual sets of revolutions that can be\ncompared, which had led to the absurdity. The theologians\u2019\nsecond kind of argument cuts off this form of escape. First, they note\nthat for the philosophers, species are eternal, that is, for example,\nthere have always existed human into the infinite past and there will\nalways exists humans into the infinite future. They then continue that\nthe leading philosophers, like Ibn S\u012bn\u0101, believe that they\nhave demonstrated that the human soul continues to exist after the\ndeath of the\n body.[2]\n In that case, if the world together with the human species existed\ninfinitely into the past, then even if only one human a day were to\ndie, there would presently and actually exist an infinite number of\nhuman souls, and that number would increase infinitely as humans died\nmoving into the infinite future. In short, the distinction between\npotential and actual infinities does not save the philosophers from\nthe purportedly absurd consequences. Thus, the assumption that the\nworld has existed infinitely into the past must be rejected.\nConsequently, the world must have begun to exist after not having\nexisted, and so the second premise of the kal\u0101m cosmological\nargument is secured.\n\nWe set aside the philosophers\u2019 defense(s) of the thesis that the\nworld always has existed infinitely into the past and merely note that\nthis issue was one of the most vigorously debated one between\ntheologians and philosophers in the Islamicate world.\n2.2 An argument from necessity/possibility (wuj\u016bb/imk\u0101n)\n\nCertainly, one of the most discussed arguments for the existence of\nGod in the medieval Islamic world was Ibn S\u012bn\u0101\u2019s\nBurh\u0101n al-Sidd\u012bq\u012bn, which can be translated as\n\u2018the demonstration of the truthful\u2019 (Avicenna\nal-Naj\u0101t, 261\u20135 & 271\u20133 = MR07:\n211\u201316 & ITN1: 4.16\u201320; see also Morewedge 1979; Mayer\n2001; McGinnis 2010b: 163\u20138; Byrne 2019 and Zarepour 2022). Ibn\nS\u012bn\u0101\u2019s proof is unique in that it does not appeal to\nthe impossibility of infinite causal series, as most cosmological\narguments, and even entertains the possibility of an actual infinity\nof causes existing simultaneously, although the argument ultimately\nshows that such a causal series is impossible. Additionally, it shows\nthat the world is causally dependent upon God for its existence at\nevery moment that it exists, even infinitely into the past.\n\nThe proof is embedded within Ibn S\u012bn\u0101\u2019s own modal\nmetaphysics (see entry on\n Ibn S\u012bn\u0101\u2019s metaphysics).\n He began by laying out the logical space when considering existents,\nand conceptually distinguishes between a necessary existent through\nitself (w\u0101jib al-wuj\u016bd bi-dh\u0101tihi) and a\npossible or contingent existent through itself (mumkin\nal-wuj\u016bd bi-dh\u0101tihi). The necessary existent through\nitself would be an entity whose existence is self-explaining and so\nexists simply on account of what it is\u2014it cannot not exist. In\ncontrast, a possible existent in itself exists on account of something\nother than itself (bi-ghayrihi)\u2014it can not exist, and\nso there is something other that explains why it exists when it does.\nAgain, these distinctions are merely the logically possible ways of\nthinking of existents. We can safely take it that at least some\nthings, perhaps all things, are possible existents in themselves, for\ncertainly most things around us, considered in themselves, are\nindifferent to whether they exist or do not exist. The question is\nwhether the conceptual space of the necessary existent through itself\nis empty or occupied.\n\nTo this question, Ibn S\u012bn\u0101 begins by considering what would\neven count as such an existent. At least one feature of such an\nentity, Ibn S\u012bn\u0101 argues, is that it must be absolutely\nsimple. His argument assumes two modest mereological claims: one, a\nwhole (jumla) exists through its parts and, two, parts are\nother than the whole. Now assume that the whole of the necessary\nexistent through itself is not simple and so consists of parts. On the\nbasis of the first mereological assumption, if the whole of the\nnecessary existent through itself consisted of parts, then its\nnecessary existence would be through those parts; however,\nfrom the second assumptions those parts are other than the\nwhole. Consequently, the whole of the necessary existent through\nitself would be necessary through another. To be \u2018through\nanother\u2019, however, is to be through what is not itself.\nWe have a contradiction: the whole of the necessary existent\nthrough itself exists through not itself. Ibn\nS\u012bn\u0101 concludes, the necessary existent through itself,\nshould it exist, must be simple. Again, Ibn S\u012bn\u0101 is not\nclaiming that anything meets this description. He is merely describing\nwhat would count as a necessary existent through itself. It is still\nan open question whether anything exists as absolutely simple and\nnecessary through itself.\n\nWith these preliminaries in place, we turn to Ibn\nS\u012bn\u0101\u2019s proof proper. Clearly, something, x,\nexists, and so must be either a necessary or a possible existent\nthrough itself\u2014these exhaust the possibilities. If x is\na necessary existent through itself, the argument is complete. If\nx is a possible existent through itself, then Ibn\nS\u012bn\u0101 asks us to consider x along with all and only\nthe other possible existents through themselves, y,\nz \u2026 n, which currently exist. Let the whole of all and\nonly things that are possible existents in themselves be W.\nSince W currently exists, it itself must be either a\nnecessary or possible existent in itself, given Ibn\nS\u012bn\u0101\u2019s modal ontology. W cannot exist as\nnecessary through itself, since it consists of the parts x,\ny, z \u2026 n, which are possible\nexistents, and as seen what is a necessary existent through itself\ncannot have parts but is absolutely simple. Consequently, W\nis possible through itself but exists through another. This other,\no, either is included within W or is outside of\nW. If o is within W, then, because\no exists, it is either a necessary or a possible existent\nthrough itself. It cannot be a necessary existent through itself,\nsince only possible existents were included in W,\nand so there would be a contradiction. Likewise, o cannot be\na possible existent through itself, for it is through o that\nW and so all the members of W exist, which includes\no. Thus, o would exist through itself, and so would\nbe a necessary existent through itself. Even if one allowed circular\ncausation, which Ibn S\u012bn\u0101 subsequently rebuts, o\nultimately, albeit indirectly, still would be necessary through\nitself. We assumed, however, that o was a possible existent\nthrough itself, a contradiction. Since o cannot exist in\nW either as a necessary or as a possible existent through\nitself on pain of contradiction, and yet those are the only\nconceptually possible ways something can exist, o must exist\noutside of W. Since W included all and only possible\nexistents through themselves, the only thing outside of W is\nthe Necessary Existent through itself, which Ibn S\u012bn\u0101\nidentified with God.\n2.3 An argument from knowledge by presences (\u02bfilm \u1e25u\u1e0d\u016br\u012b)\n\nThe discussion of proofs for the existence of God by \u1e62adr\nal-D\u012bn Muhammad Sh\u012br\u0101z\u012b, simply known as\nMull\u0101 \u1e62adr\u0101 (d. 1636), is very much embedded within\nhis own process ontology (see\n section on the proof in the entry on Mulla Sadra).\n That ontology itself is an outgrowth of his mystic-inspired\nphilosophical vision of religion, which gives precedence to the direct\nexperience or presence of God. While he believes that there is a\ndefinite proof for God, he is skeptical of the earlier traditional\narguments for God. In most general terms, his concern with earlier\nproofs is that they all proceed from the existence of something other\nthan God and then infer to the existence of God, and yet God is the\nvery ground for the existence of everything else. If anything, God is\nproof of that other. More specifically, Mull\u0101 \u1e62adr\u0101\ncriticizes the fact that all earlier proofs begin with certain\nconcepts or essences, like necessity and possibility, which are\nmental, and then illicitly infer from concepts of things to their\nexistence, which is extra-mental. This claim is even true for the\nkal\u0101m cosmological argument, which begins with the concept of\n\u2018the world\u2019, and then from the assumption that that\nconcept refers and so exists infers the existence of God. For\nMull\u0101 \u1e62adr\u0101 one simply cannot move from mere concepts\nto existence\u2014one must begin with existence itself\u2014and so\nall of these earlier arguments fail.\n\nMull\u0101 \u1e62adr\u0101\u2019s own \u2018proof\u2019 for the\nexistence of God is less a proof for God\u2019s existence than a\npointer that directs one to an experience that one already has and\nthen clarifies that experience. It would be analogous to one who has\nexperienced frogs, toads and salamanders, but then claims that they\nhave never experienced an amphibian. The proof that one has\nexperienced amphibians is to lead them to recognize that their\nexperience of frogs, toads and salamanders is an amphibian-experience.\nIn this vein, Mull\u0101 \u1e62adr\u0101 draws on the Qur\u2019anic\nverse\u2014\u201cGod (All\u0101h) is witness that there is no god\nbut He\u201d (Qur\u2019an 3.18). He suggests that we all have\nexperienced God, even if we have not recognized that the experience is\nabout God. That is because existence never can be negated or denied.\nFor even if there is non-existence, there is a sense that there\nis something, and while as simple as it might be, that something\nexists. There simply cannot not be existence argues\nMull\u0101 \u1e62adr\u0101, and indeed the experience or knowledge of\nthis existence is present to everyone. Nothing, then, stands above\nexistence (not even non-existence), and yet God just is that existence\nabove which nothing stands. For Mull\u0101 \u1e62adr\u0101 existence\nis not something static but dynamic, a single reality that varies in\nintensity and modulation (tashk\u012bk). God is existence at\nits greatest intensity and perfection. To be sure, while the\nexperience or belief that there is this existence is basic\nfor everyone, it is not necessary for everyone to experience this\nexistence as God. To be sure, recognizing this existence\nas God might take long practice and training as prescribed by\nSufi masters. Still, one\u2019s experience of this existence as God\nand consequent belief that it is God, which follows upon a knowledge\nby presence, is for Mull\u0101 \u1e62adr\u0101, properly basic and in\nneed of no further proof.\n3. God and the universe: creation and conservation/maintenance of the universe\n\nA question closely related to the existence of God is that of\nGod\u2019s relation to other existents, that is, the universe. There\nare two distinct but related aspects to this question. The first is\nwhether God is the cause of the universe\u2019s existence, for there\nhave been thinkers, like Aristotle, who believe both that God (or at\nleast a first unmoved mover) exists and is related to the cosmos,\nwhile denying that God is the cause of the universe\u2019s very\nexistence. The question here is whether God is a creator. The second\naspect to the question of God\u2019s relation to the universe assumes\nthat God is a creator and further asks, \u201cWhat is God\u2019s\nimmediate and present causal relation to the universe?\u201d Some\nthinkers, like deists, maintain that God creates the universe and then\nproverbially steps back and lets the world continue on its own like a\nwell-made clock. Others, in contrast, hold that at every moment that\nthe world exists, it is causally and ontologically dependent upon\nGod\u2019s conserving power and should God remove his proverbial\nhand, the cosmos would slip into nothingness and oblivion. Muslim\nphilosophers and theologians alike had decided views on both of these\nissues.\n3.1 Creation\n\nMuslim theologians and philosophers, with rare exceptions, agreed that\nGod is a creator and that the cosmos\u2019 existence is in some way\ncausally dependent or grounded upon God. (Ibn Rush, who follows\nAristotle and denies that God is strictly an efficient cause of the\nworld, is clearly an outlier.) What was at issue among these thinkers,\nand where there was virulent disagreement, was the nature of this\ncausal dependence and grounding. There were three competing models to\nexplain God\u2019s divine creative act. Many, but not all,\nphilosophers viewed the world as emanating or flowing\n(faya\u1e0d\u0101n) from the very being of God. Theologians\nas a group favored a model of temporal coming-to-be, occurrence or\norigination (i\u1e25d\u0101th), which frequently resulted in\nsome form of occasionalism. Finally, the third model presents creation\nas a manifestation (ma\u1e93hir) of one single reality, a\nparadigm that Sufis or thinkers with a mystical orientation mainly\nupheld. Closely aligned with the nature of God\u2019s causal relation\nto the world is the issue of the age of the universe, and particularly\nwhether the cosmos has existed infinitely into the past. While the\nquestion of the world\u2019s age is not the primary focus here, a\nparticular answer to it frequently is tied to a given model of the\ndivine creative act. Let us consider each of these models.\n3.1.1 Creation as emanation (fay\u1e0d)\n\nMany of the Muslim philosophers, although again not all, adopted some\nversion of creation by \u2018emanation\u2019 (fay\u1e0d or\nfaya\u1e0d\u0101n) to explain God\u2019s causal relation to\nthe universe. In general, the emanation thesis makes two claims:\n\nthat the universe proceeds from God eternally and\nthat God\u2019s causation is mediated so that lower things come\nfrom higher ones, not directly from God.\n\n\nThe details of this general thesis frequently differed among different\nthinkers. Here we consider the details of Ibn S\u012bn\u0101\u2019s\nversion of emanation.\n\nWe have seen Ibn S\u012bn\u0101\u2019s proof for the existence of the\nNecessary Existent through itself, which in effect shows that at any\ninstant that the universe, understood as the whole of all\npossible/contingent things, exists, God must be conserving it in\nexistence. We have also seen his proof for divine simplicity (see\n \u00a72.2).\n Ibn S\u012bn\u0101 believes that these two doctrines further imply\nthat God\u2019s creative act must be eternal, and so likewise the\neffect of that creative act must also be eternal. In that case, the\ncosmos, if not eternal, is at least sempiternal\n(sarmad\u012b) and perpetual (dahr) (Acar 2010).\nWhile Ibn S\u012bn\u0101 has a number of independent proofs by which\nhe argues that the world has always existed (Avicenna MetaH: 9.1 &\nPhysH: 3.11), one need merely consider how he conceives the\nworld\u2019s relation to God and the nature of God\u2019s creating\nto grasp why he held this position. His account is embedded within his\ndiscussion of God\u2019s knowledge of the world (Avicenna MetaH: 8.6\n[6\u201322] & 8.7).\n\nOne of the divine attributes is knowledge. In human intellects,\nknowledge occurs when we interact with an already existing world, and\nthe things in the world in some way act upon our intellects so that\nour potential to understand is realized and our intellect in a sense\nreceives some concept that it previously did not have. For numerous\nreasons such an account of intellect cannot apply to the deity. First,\nGod is free of potentiality, inasmuch as potentiality refers to\nsomething possible or contingent, and God as the Necessary Existent in\nitself is outside of the whole of possible existents. Second, if God\nwere to receive anything, there would be both that which is received\nand what receives, and so God would be composite, which is impossible\ngiven Ibn S\u012bn\u0101\u2019s doctrine of divine simplicity. Faced\nwith these issues Ibn S\u012bn\u0101 introduces a different model of\ndivine knowledge, which additionally explains God\u2019s creative\nact.\n\nAccording to Ibn S\u012bn\u0101\u2019s model, what God knows directly\nand primarily is the divine self. Because God is perfect, and indeed\nabove perfection, God must know himself perfectly. In that case, he\nmust know that he is the ultimate cause and grounds of all existence,\nbut in order to know a cause perfectly, one must likewise know the\neffect of that cause perfectly, which just is the cosmos in this case.\nUnlike with human knowledge, where our knowledge of a thing,\nx, is in some way caused by x\u2019s\nexistence, in divine knowledge God\u2019s knowledge of x\ncauses x to exist. In other words, there emanates from\nGod\u2019s self-knowledge the very existence of the cosmos, which Ibn\nS\u012bn\u0101 identifies with the order of the good. Since God\nexisted infinitely into the past and will exist infinitely into the\nfuture and is always self-knowing, the emanation of the cosmos must\nlikewise have existed infinitely into the past and will continue\ninfinitely into the future.\n\nNot merely does Ibn S\u012bn\u0101 think that God must create\neternally, he also thinks it is all but heresy\n(il\u1e25\u0101d) to claim that God started to create at\nsome first moment in the finite past (Avicenna PhysH: 3.11 [9]). That\nis because if God were not creating the cosmos eternally, there would\nbe some time when the divinity is not willing the creation of the\nworld and some time when it is willing the creation of the world.\nConsequently, there would be a change in the divine will, and so God\nwould have changed. Whatever is subject to change, Ibn S\u012bn\u0101\ncontinues, must be composite in some way, for there is that which\nperdures throughout the change and that which is either lost or comes\nto be. The idea of temporal creation is thus incompatible with divine\nsimplicity, and to adopt it is for Ibn S\u012bn\u0101 is to forgo the\ndoctrine of God\u2019s oneness/uniqueness\n(taw\u1e25\u012bd), which is central to Islam.\n\nThere is one further point about Ibn S\u012bn\u0101\u2019s conception\nof God\u2019s relation to creation that should be made, namely, the\nextent to which Ibn S\u012bn\u0101\u2019s deity creates as an act of\nvolition. For Ibn S\u012bn\u0101 a willful agent (1) recognizes the\naction it is doing, (2) is not forced to act and (3) is content or\nsatisfied (ri\u1e0dan) with its action (Avicenna MetaH: 9.4\n[3]). Ibn S\u012bn\u0101 distinguishes an act of will from either an\nact of intention (qa\u1e63d) or an act of nature\n(\u1e6dab\u02bf). God\u2019s act is not by way of nature,\nsince such actions proceed from the agent independent of knowledge and\nconsent, and yet there is nothing about the Necessary Existing through\nitself that it does not perfectly know and to which it does not\nperfectly consent. Ibn S\u012bn\u0101 likewise denies that God acts\nintentionally. That is because intentional actions involve the\nagent\u2019s conceptualizing some good, then a separate act of\nacquiring that good and finally the good that is acquired.\nConsequently, only an agent who is composite and not simple acts out\nof intention, but again Ibn S\u012bn\u0101\u2019s deity is absolutely\nsimple. These considerations likewise explain why for Ibn\nS\u012bn\u0101, God\u2019s creating does not, and indeed cannot,\nrequire choice among options, and yet it is a free act of the will. It\nis a free, precisely because God knows he is creating, consents to\nthat creation and in no way is forced to create.\n3.1.2 Creation as origination (\u1ecbd\u0101th) after non-existence\n\nThe theologians were not impressed with the emanationist account of\nGod\u2019s creative act. Despite Ibn S\u012bn\u0101\u2019s move to\nre-interpret volitional action, emanation seemed to the theologians to\nbe little more than an act of nature, as if the sun were to know and\nto be glad that it shines, but also having no choice in the matter. A\nfree act of the will, they maintained, essentially involves choice,\nand so any action not involving choice is not free. The theologians\nwere likewise not impressed with arguments from simplicity that\nconcluded that if God were to choose, God would not be simple. For\nsome of them, like the early Ghaz\u0101l\u012b, were happy to deny the\nstrong conception of divine simplicity, which many philosophers\nfavored, since it seemed contrary to their belief that God has a\nnumber of distinct divine attributes, like life, power, knowledge and\nwill (McGinnis 2022).\n\nA potentially serious challenge to the theologians came in explaining\na change in the divine will, namely, the change from\nwilling-not-to-create to willing-to-create. The issue now is what\ncaused that change in God, for if God is the Cause of causes, then\nnothing outside of God could explain that change of will, whereas if\ncreating is essential to God, it is no longer clear how the\ntheologians\u2019 position substantially differs from some version of\nemanation. Ghaz\u0101l\u012b provided what becomes the standard\nAsh\u02bfarite theological response: From all eternity God freely\nwilled the creation of the world at the moment that it comes to be\n(Ghaz\u0101l\u012b Incoherence, disc. 1, [13]). Thus, if one\nimagines the whole of time as forming a timeline, where God creates at\nsome given moment, t then at every moment on that timeline,\nGod wills the creation of the world at t. Of course, God\ncould have willed from all eternity to create at some moment other\nthan t or indeed not to create at all. Regardless of the\ncase, there would have been no change in the divine will.\n\nThere was push back against this account of the immutability of\nGod\u2019s eternal will from multiple directions, perhaps the most\npressing is that it only changes the focus of the original concern,\nnamely that there still must be a cause of God\u2019s willing some\ngiven moment to be the first moment of creation. More specifically,\nassume that God eternally willed to create our universe some fourteen\nbillion years ago. Of course, if God is truly omnipotent (and this\ndivine attribute was non-negotiable for Ash\u02bfarite theologians),\nthen God eternally could have willed to create the world fifteen or\nsixteen billion years ago or even as early as ten-thousand years ago.\nIndeed, there are an infinite number of moments, all of which seem\nequally likely candidates for when God could have created our cosmos.\nThus, either there is some cause for God\u2019s choosing to create at\nthe moment he does or the choice is haphazard and random and so not\nthe act of an agent acting from knowledge. In short, either there is a\nreason for God\u2019s creating at the moment that he does\u2014and\nso God\u2019s action is caused\u2014or there is no reason\u2014and\nso God\u2019s action is without reason, and so is irrational. Neither\noption seems appealing.\n\nGhaz\u0101l\u012b had a response, which again became the standard one\namong Ash\u02bfarites (Ghaz\u0101l\u012b Incoherence, disc. 1\n[45\u20136]). According to him, the essential function of the will is\nsimply to choose among indiscernibles independent of any cause for the\nparticular choice made. Of course, there is a sense in which the\nchoice is \u2018arbitrary\u2019, but only in the sense that the\naction is a result of the will and nothing else. The standard example\nof this point is that of a starving man presented with identical\npieces of food, who is also equally disposed to all of them, e.g., one\npiece is not closer to the man nor is the man either left- or\nright-handed, etc. The man will certainly take one piece and eat\ndespite lacking any reason for taking that particular piece of food,\nand yet assuredly the act is one of a rational agent, for only an\nimbecile under these circumstances would starve in indecision. This\ngeneral account of will holds not only for humans but also for God.\nThus, maintained Ghaz\u0101l\u012b, from all eternity God wills to\ncreate (and so God\u2019s will does not change), yet purely as an act\nof the will does God will to create at the particular moment that he\ndoes (for that, according to Ghaz\u0101l\u012b, is exactly what it\nmeans to be a rational volitional agent).\n3.1.3 Creation as manifestation (ma\u1e93hir) of a single reality\n\nA yet third way that the world\u2019s dependence upon God was\nenvisioned within the Islamicate world is that of Mull\u0101\n\u1e62adr\u0101, who drew inspiration from Ibn \u02bfArab\u012b\n(Mull\u0101 \u1e62adr\u0101 Penetrations, 68\u201371; also\nsee Rahman 1975: 59\u201363 and Kalin 2014: 104\u201319). Mull\u0101\n\u1e62adr\u0101\u2019s account appeals to his theory of\ntashk\u012bk al-wuj\u016bd (literally, \u2018the ambiguity\nof existence\u2019, but which contemporary scholar commonly label\n\u2018the modulation of existence\u2019) as well as his novel notion\nof \u2018substantial motion\u2019 (al-\u1e25araka\nl-jawhariyya). (See the\n section on monism and pluralism in the entry on Mulla Sadra.)\n\nBoth notions are complex and even to provide a general sense of how\nMull\u0101 \u1e62adr\u0101 conceives God\u2019s causal relation to\ncreation would be a move away from the philosophy of religion into\ngeneral metaphysics. Still, brief, even if inadequate, comments are\nwarranted. As for the modulation of existence, according to Mull\u0101\n\u1e62adr\u0101, God is existence at existence\u2019s maximally\nperfect, eternal and unchanging limit, and only God is perfect,\ninfinite, eternal and unchanging. Creation is the manifestation of\nexistence at degrees that fall short of the divine infinite existence.\nThis is Mull\u0101 \u1e62adr\u0101\u2019s doctrine of the\n\u2018modulation of existence\u2019. Mull\u0101\n\u1e62adr\u0101\u2019s doctrine of \u2018substantial motion\u2019\ncomplements this ontology. It is the idea that all changes, whether\nchange of location, state or the like, are ultimately the result of\ncontinuous change in the very substance and essences of things. This\nview is radical in that Mull\u0101 \u1e62adr\u0101 is suggesting that\nabsolutely nothing persist through change. There are no perduring\nmatter, forms, species and essences. Everything, apart from God, is in\na constant state of evolution. Not random evolution, to be sure, but\nunceasing evolution directed toward God with creation forever becoming\nmore godlike.\n\nGiven the doctrines of the modulation of existence and substantial\nmotion, Mull\u0101 \u1e62adr\u0101 offers a unique response to the\nquestion of the world\u2019s age. Since the very substances and\nessences of things are in a state of constant change, nothing other\nthan God is eternal, existing infinitely into the past and into the\nfuture. Instead, everything other than God, and this includes the\nuniverse as a whole, comes to exist after not having existed. Thus,\namong created things there simply can be no existent, such as the\nuniverse itself, that has persisted infinitely into the past.\nConsequently, with the theologians, Mull\u0101 \u1e62adr\u0101 agrees\nthat creation must be viewed in terms of temporal coming to be, in the\nsense of coming to be after not having existed. Be that as it may, his\nconception of substantial motion also allows, in the spirit of the\nemanationists, that infinitely into the past and infinitely into the\nfuture God is the wellspring of existence constantly creating with\ncreation constantly evolving. Thus, while God\u2019s creative act can\nbe eternal, nothing in the creaturely order, like matter, forms or\nessences, remains the same as to have always perdured.\n3.2 God\u2019s conservation of the universe\n\nMuslim theologians and most, but not all, Muslim philosophers agreed\nthat the world cannot conserve its own existence and so its existence\nat every moment that it exists is in some way dependent upon God. The\nreal issue for these thinkers is what role, if any, do creatures play\nin the ongoing processes that constitute the world? Specifically, do\nor can creatures have causal powers or is God not merely the Cause of\ncauses but the only Cause? Broadly, there were three responses to this\nquestion: that of the philosophers, which appeals to their theories of\nessential causation in the form of emanation and natural causation\namong creatures; that of the Mu\u02bftazilite theologians, which tends\ntoward divine occasionalism yet reserved some causal efficacy for\nrational agents; and that of the Ash\u02bfarites and Maturidite\ntheologians, which is also occasionalist, but reserves all or at least\nvirtually all causal efficacy for God alone. Here we focus primarily\non the philosophers\u2019 theory of essential causation and the\ntheory of occasionalism that the theologians shared.\n3.2.1 Essential causation and providence\n\nPhilosophers such as Kind\u012b, F\u0101r\u0101b\u012b, Ibn\nS\u012bn\u0101 and Ibn Rushd all adopted some form of essential or\nnatural causation, some more influenced by the Neoplatonic\nemanationist framework, others less influenced by that framework\n(Kind\u012b RKF: 214\u201337 = MR07: 1\u201316;\nF\u0101r\u0101b\u012b Perfect State, ch. 8; Avicenna PhysH:\nbk. 1.5 (= MR07: 156\u201363) & 1.9\u201312 and Ibn Rushd\nMetaphysics, 105\u201312 & Questions,\n11\u201314). (Ibn Rushd explicitly rejected emanation, whether from\nGod or from creatures, while allowing that creatures have natural\ncausal powers, i.e., that their natures were the source of actions\nthat are strictly speaking their own; see Kogan 1985, esp. ch. 3 and\n5.) For present purposes, we focus on Ibn S\u012bn\u0101\u2019s\nemanationist-influenced theory of causation, since it would become\nboth the preferred approach of supporters as well as the preferred\ntarget of detractors in the post-Avicennan period. Ibn\nS\u012bn\u0101\u2019s proof for the existence of the Necessary\nExistent through itself is set up in terms of explaining the existence\nof the whole of all possible/contingent things that exist at any given\nmoment. Given its setup, that proof likewise shows that the\nworld\u2014understood as all the possible things that have, presently\ndo or will exist\u2014is dependent upon God as that which conserves\nit in existence at every moment that the world exists. The causal\nmechanism explaining this dependency relation again is emanation,\nwhere, on Ibn S\u012bn\u0101\u2019s own unique theory of emanation,\nit is a possible existent that emanates from the Necessary Existent in\nitself.\n\nHere it is worth noting that for many philosophers, while ultimately\neverything in the world traces its existence back to the divine\nemanation, God is not the immediate cause of everything.\nInstead, God is only the immediate cause of a single effect,\nidentified with the First Intellect. Ibn S\u012bn\u0101 is adamant on\nthis point: \u2018From the One only one proceeds\u2019 (Avicenna\nMetaH: 9.4 [5]; also see Amin 2020 and Dadikhuda 2020). Still, from\nthat one effect a plethora of effects, i.e., other possible existents,\ncascade downward, all of which are mediately but ultimately dependent\non God for their conservation and their continued existence at every\nmoment that they exist. In other words, the created order overflows\nfrom the Necessary Existent in coherent grades of existents, namely, a\nhierarchy of immaterial creatures, like intellects or angels, followed\nby the material realm. In each case the higher-grade functions as the\nimmediate causal principle of the next lower grade.\n\nThis emanationist cosmology is rooted in the Neoplatonic principle\nthat \u201cevery activity in the world is in some sense double\ninsofar as it possesses both an inner and an outer aspect\u201d (see\nentry on\n neoplatonism).\n The inner aspect is the thing\u2019s nature, which is the principle\nand cause of those activities that are essential to being a certain\nkind of thing. For example, the inner activity of a tree, which the\ntree\u2019s nature determines, gives rise to its producing the shape,\nleaves, fruit etc. specific to that kind of tree. Another common\nexample is fire\u2019s burning cotton, for fire\u2019s nature is to\nburn, while cotton is of a nature that when in contact with fire, the\ncotton is burnt. Our world, for the philosophers, then, is a network\nof possible existents each having causal powers specific to their\nkind, all of which are ultimately dependent upon God for their\nexistence.\n\nFinally, while Ibn S\u012bn\u0101 insists that God is not acting with\nthe intention of the world\u2019s good, our world still is the\nbeneficiary of God\u2019s providence. That is because in knowing\nhimself God knows the order of the good in the most perfectly possible\nway, and God\u2019s self-knowledge, as seen in the discussion of Ibn\nS\u012bn\u0101\u2019s account of creations (see\n \u00a73.1.1),\n is his very act of emanation. Consequently, what emanates from him is\nan order that is the most perfectly possible commensurate with the\nchain of possible existents. This optimal ordering of existents, whose\nreality is grounded in the Necessary Existent, just is, for Ibn\nS\u012bn\u0101, providence (\u02bfin\u0101ya).\n\nHere it is certainly worth noting that, for Ibn S\u012bn\u0101, and\nothers like F\u0101r\u0101b\u012b and Ibn Rushd (F\u0101r\u0101b\u012b\nPerfect State, \u00a7\u00a76\u20137, Avicenna MetaH: 8.6\n[6]\u20138.7 and Ibn Rushd Metaphysics ad Textus\n51), God does not know particulars in their particularity, e.g., that\nyou are reading this sentence at this very moment; rather, God knows\nparticulars only universally. Moreover, God does not act for our sake\nsuch that our good is the final end of God\u2019s creative act, even\nthought we are the benefactors of the divine goodness\n(F\u0101r\u0101b\u012b al-Siy\u0101sa, 47\u20138 = MR07:\n91\u20132 [\u00b6\u00b6 31\u20132]; Avicenna MetaH: 8.3 [1\u20133]\n& al-Naj\u0101t, 146\u20139 = MR07: 216\u201319 and Ibn\nRushd Metaphysics ad Textus 52). Despite these\ncaveats, Ibn S\u012bn\u0101 believes that God\u2019s universal\nknowledge is sufficient to ensure that\n\n\nnot even the weight of a dust speck, whether in the heavens or on the\nEarth, escapes your Lord\u2019s notice (Qur\u2019an 10:61).\n(Avicenna al-Naj\u0101t, 247 = MR07: 217).\n\n\nThus by Ibn S\u012bn\u0101\u2019s lights divine providence is still\nensured. Ibn Rushd makes a similar point about divine providence (Ibn\nRushd Metaphysics ad Textus 52).\n3.2.2 Occasionalism\n\nMany Muslim theologians viewed the philosophers\u2019 idea of natures\nwith causal powers as one that impugned God\u2019s omnipotence and\nhis divine sovereignty over all that is. In addition, they found the\nphilosophers\u2019 argumentation for essential or natural causation\nwanting. First, Muslim theologians were not impressed with either the\ntheory of emanation or the philosophers\u2019 account of essential or\nnatural causation. In the Incoherence of the Philosophers,\nafter faithfully presenting the philosophers\u2019 discussion of\nemanation, Ghaz\u0101l\u012b says,\n\n\nWhat they have said is arbitrary and really just shadows in the dark.\nWere someone to utter this while dreaming, we would think they were\ndelirious! (Ghaz\u0101l\u012b Incoherence, disc. 3 [48])\n\n\nAs for the philosophers\u2019 theory of natures and natural\ncausation, even before Ghaz\u0101l\u012b, Ab\u016b Bakr\nal-B\u0101qill\u0101n\u012b (d. 1013), a rough contemporary of Ibn\nS\u012bn\u0101\u2019s and whom Ghaz\u0101l\u012b subsequently\nfollows, challenged the philosophers\u2019 account of natures\n(B\u0101qill\u0101n\u012b al-Tamh\u012bd, 34\u201347 and\nGhaz\u0101l\u012b Incoherence, disc. 17). These theologians\nnote that the philosophers\u2019 reason for insisting on natures with\ncausal powers and natural necessitation is purportedly drawn from\nempirical observations: One regularly observes, for example,\nfire\u2019s contact with cotton and the burning of the cotton or the\nimbibing of alcohol and the intoxication of the imbiber and a\nmultitude of other such regularities. The philosophers maintain that\nthese regularities require that the nature of fire, for example,\ncauses the cotton to burn because the nature of cotton is to be so\naffected and similarly for the rest of regularities in the natural\norder. B\u0101qill\u0101n\u012b and Ghaz\u0101l\u012b push back on\nthis last assumption. We do not observe causal connections, they note,\nbut merely constant conjunctions: one event followed by another. While\nnatural causation could explain these constant conjunctions,\nGod\u2019s habit (\u02bf\u0101da) or custom of creating a\ngiven event after another could equally explain them.\n\nIn place of natural causation, many Muslim theologians held some\ntheory of occasionalism (Fakhry 1958 and Perler & Rudolph, 2000:\n13\u2013124). For them, God is not simply the Cause of causes, he in\nfact is the only cause. God not merely brought the world into\nexistence at some moment in the past, but indeed at every instance, he\nre-creates the world anew. In its extreme form, there is only the\nillusion of a continuity between moments or a creature\u2019s\npersisting through time. Changes in the world, thus, are solely the\nresult of God\u2019s re-creating the world slightly differently at\neach subsequent moment. Consequently, nothing other than God can truly\nbe an agent of change or action.\n\nSome might find the theologians\u2019 theory of occasionalism\nmetaphysically exotic. For many theologians, it was simply an\nimplication of God\u2019s absolute omnipotence: God truly has\nall power, and so no concession is made to creatures (see\nWolfson 1976: VII.I). Even Ghaz\u0101l\u012b, who concedes that humans\nhave a modicum of power, hastens to add that when compared to\nGod\u2019s omnipotence our power resembles impotence\n(Ghaz\u0101l\u012b Moderation, 99). B\u0101qill\u0101n\u012b\nhimself (B\u0101qill\u0101n\u012b al-Tamh\u012bd,\n34\u201347) has a more philosophically rather than theologically\nengaged answer. He argues that occasionalism is metaphysically\npreferable to the theory of natural causation on the grounds of a\nPrinciple of Paucity: Given two theories each of which equally well\nexplains the same phenomena, the simpler theory should be preferred.\nThe philosophers must posit at least two ontologically distinct kinds\nof causes: divine causation and natural causation (which itself\nburgeons into a passel of further ontologically distinct kinds of\ncauses). In contrast, occasionalism, B\u0101qill\u0101n\u012b\nobserves, needs posit only one kind of cause, God, and so should be\npreferred.\n4. Prophecy and Miracles\n\nAssuming that God exists and stands in some ontological relation with\ncreation, does God, in some way, directly make his will and\nprovidential care known to us? For Muslim theologians and some\nphilosophers, humans receive guidance in how to construct a\nwell-ordered society through the message of prophets. These messages\nare a source of correct beliefs about God, how we should live, our\nplace in the cosmos and our ultimate destiny in the hereafter. Given\nthe centrality of prophecy (nubuwwa) to Islam, two distinct\nquestions faced Muslim philosophers and theologians alike. One is\njustifying and even explaining prophecy as a source of true justified\nbeliefs. The other is identifying a true prophet and distinguishing\nhim from a charlatan, trickster or even sorcerer.\n4.1 Prophecy\n\nConcerning the first issue of justifying and explaining prophecy,\nproponents of prophecy were faced with a challenge. Since humans are\nrational, presumably they can acquire knowledge of reality and the\nrules of conduct regarding their individual and social life on their\nown. Thus, one may ask, \u201cWhy are prophets necessary for\nacquiring true beliefs and proper rules of conduct?\u201d Indeed,\nMuslims did encounter opposition to their belief in prophecy, ranging\nfrom those who claimed it was redundant\u2014at least as the,\nadmittedly hostile, reports about Ab\u016b Bakr al-R\u0101z\u012b\nrelate\u2014to those who thought it was simply impossible\u2014a\nposition that Muslim theologians ascribed to Ibn al-R\u0101wand\u012b\n(b. ca. 815) and the Bar\u0101hima, arguably the Brahmans of\nIndia (see Stroumsa 1999). Detractors of prophecy formulated the\nproblem regarding the need for prophecy as a dilemma (A. H.\nR\u0101z\u012b Proofs of Prophecy: 24\u20136 &\n131\u20134; Juwayn\u012b Proofs, 165; Nasaf\u012b TA: vol.\nII, 1\u20133). If, on the one hand, that which a prophet teaches on\nthe basis of revelation agrees with that which reason can show, there\nis no need for prophecy. If, on the other hand, that which a prophet\nteaches is inaccessible to reason, then it is not rational, and so to\nbe rejected. The argument continues that it seems impossible that God\nshould act in vain, but if he were to send prophets, he would be\nacting in vain, since the presence of prophets is either redundant or\ntheir message is in a sense irrational.\n\nTheologians and certain Muslim philosophers both wanted to justify and\nto explain prophecy in light of this challenge. Theologians preferred\nto show why, despite the above dilemma, prophecy is possible and not\nvain: If anything, it is a sign of God\u2019s grace. Certain\nphilosophers aimed to show that in addition to prophecy\u2019s being\npossible, there is a natural explanation for it grounded in natural\nphilosophy. While both groups\u2019 approaches are significantly\ndifferent, they share a common feature. Both recognized that human\ncognitive capacities differ and that not all humans are equal with\nregard to those capacities. Indeed, most humans need the symbolic and\nsimplified message of a prophet to reach genuine knowledge of the key\nreligious, ethical and social elements necessary for a devout\nlife.\n\nJuwayn\u012b followed by his student Ghaz\u0101l\u012b are\nrepresentatives of the theologians (Juwayn\u012b\nal-Irsh\u0101d, 302\u20137 = Juwayn\u012b Proofs,\n165\u20137 and Ghaz\u0101l\u012b Moderation, 188\u201395;\nalso see Griffel 2004). For them, it is reasonable that different\nindividuals with different intellectual capacities may know one and\nthe same truth in different ways. One way, however, need not make\nanother way redundant, let alone impossible. Also, even if on their\nown some humans can learn certain specific religious claims, reaching\nthem frequently is difficult and requires a lengthy and diligent\ninquiry, which not all either are willing to do or even capable of\ndoing. Hence, these theologians conclude, it is appropriate, although\nnot obligatory, that God makes such truths available through prophets\nin order that people who do not have the time nor capacity to pursue\nsuch an inquiry still can learn about God and things divine. In this\nrespect, prophecy, far from being vain, is a sign of God\u2019s grace\nand concession to human diversity and weakness.\n\nThe philosophers\u2019 have multiple strategies when treating\nprophecy. For example, Ibn Rushd maintains that while philosophy and\nscience provide the most complete theoretical account of the\nworld and God\u2019s relation to it, prophecy and religion more\ngenerally provide a practical knowledge of what is good and\nright with respect to one\u2019s actions (see Taylor 2018). Ibn Rushd\nmakes this point when identify which kinds of purported miracles are\ngenuine signs of a prophet. He likens a prophet to a physician. If two\nindividuals were both to claim to be physicians, and one says,\n\u201cHere is my proof\u201d, and then walks on water, whereas the\nother heals the sick, it is the latter\u2019s proof that is truly\nrelevant and convincing that he is a physician. Similarly, if two\nindividuals claim to be prophets, and so bearers of a message about\nwhat God wants of us in order to live well and devoutly, and one gives\nas proof some seemingly supernatural act, while the other provides\nlaws and knowledge that actually allow one to live well and devoutly,\nit is the latter who is the genuine prophet (Ibn Rushd\nExpositions, 104\u20135). It is noteworthy that like\nF\u0101r\u0101b\u012b, Ibn Rushd distinguishes between philosophers\nand those incapable of grasping philosophical proof. As for prophetic\nmessages, the latter group needs only know that prophecy conveys what\nis necessary for living a religious life, while any theoretical\naccount of prophecy must be withheld from them. The fact is that it is\nunclear whether Ibn Rushd has or even thinks that there can be a\ntheoretical account of prophecy, since in his works exclusively for\nphilosophers (mu\u02beawwal) he is prone to be completely\nsilent or at most raises unanswered puzzles about prophecy.\n\nA theoretical account of prophecy and the mechanism through which it\npurportedly occurs are seen in the works of F\u0101r\u0101b\u012b and\nIbn S\u012bn\u0101 (F\u0101r\u0101b\u012b Perfect State: ch.\n14 and Avicenna DA: 5.6 = MR07: 204\u20135; also see Walzer 1957 and\nMarmura 1964). Both philosophers would agree with Ibn Rushd that the\nprimary aspect of prophecy and revelation is grounded in the need for\nlaws and political institutions. That is because these laws and\npolitical institutions delineate and support actions directed toward\nthe proper end of humans, namely, happiness or flourishing\n(sa\u02bf\u0101da), which intimately involves a knowledge of\nGod (F\u0101r\u0101b\u012b al-Tanb\u012bh = MR07:\n104\u201320 Avicenna MetaH: 10.2). Unlike Ibn Rushd, they\nadditionally want to provide a theoretical account of prophecy. This\ntheoretical account attempts to show that far from being a\nsupernatural act, as the theologians believe, prophecy is a natural\nphenomenon and as such has a naturalistic explanation. This attempt at\na naturalistic explanation of prophecy is grounded in both their\nemanationist metaphysics and philosophy of mind (see entry on\n Arabic and Islamic psychology and philosophy of mind).\n The details of their positions are complex, so the following is\nsimply to provide a general sense of their strategy.\n\nAs seen, for F\u0101r\u0101b\u012b and Ibn S\u012bn\u0101, there\nemanates from God the order of the good in the form of a cascade of\ngrades of dependent or possible existents, each of which can itself be\na source of emanation and a principle of a lower grade. Human\ncognition is itself part of this overflowing: Human intellects receive\nthis emanation once they are suitably prepared and to the extent that\nthey are capable, which in turn perfects the intellects so that they\ncome to have knowledge of our world and God. Next, as noted earlier,\nthe philosophers recognize varying degrees among human cognitive\ncapacities. At the very apex of these varying degrees of capacity is\nthe intellect and imaginative power of prophets. The prophets\u2019\ncognitive powers are wholly and perfectly disposed to receive this\nemanation, and to the greatest extent possible for humans they grasp\nthe divine order of the good as it emanates from God. Moreover, from\ntheir intellects the cascade of emanation continues, now entering into\ntheir imagination such that they sensibly experience as symbols and\nimages what they perfectly know through receiving this ultimately\ndivine emanation. It is these symbols and images that the prophets use\nto convey God\u2019s proverbial plan to those who are otherwise\nincapable of acquiring this knowledge. While the above presentation\noverly emphasizes the \u2018metaphysical\u2019 aspect of their\ntheory of prophecy, the fact is that the bulk of the theory is\ndiscussed and developed in natural philosophy, particularly in works\ncorresponding with Aristotle\u2019s De anima and discussions\nin the novel reworking of the Arabic version of Aristotle\u2019s\nParva Naturalia (for the Arabic verion of the Parva\nNaturalia see Hansberger 2010). In a real sense, the aim is to\nnaturalize prophecy. Thus, prophecy, for these philosophers, is\npossible precisely because it is the natural, even necessary, outcome\nof certain rare, but wholly natural, psychological processes.\n4.2 Miracles\n\nThe second issue again is distinguishing the true prophet from a\ncharlatan, trickster or even sorcerer. If it is reasonable that God\nappoints prophets, the question that immediately arises is how to\nrecognize them and to justify their claims to prophethood. In response\nto this challenge many thinkers in the Islamicate world, theologians\nand philosophers alike, identified performing miracles as a decisive\nsign of one\u2019s rightful claim to being a prophet (\u02bfAbd\nal-Jabb\u0101r SUK: 568\u20139; Juwayn\u012b Proofs,\n167\u20138; Ibn F\u016brak Mujarrad Maq\u0101l\u0101t,\n176\u201380; and B\u0101qill\u0101n\u012b al-Tamh\u012bd,\n141\u201360).\n\nThe Arabic term for a prophet\u2019s miracle is\nmu\u02bfjiza, which means that which shows the\nimpotence of others. Specifically, a miracle is a challenge\nby the prophet to others to perform a similar act, which the others\nare presumably incapable of doing. In general, then, a miracle is any\nextraordinary event that confirms an individual\u2019s claims to\nprophethood (Juwayn\u012b Proofs, 168\u201372). Muslims\nrecognize two kinds of such extraordinary events. The first is any\nevent that follows upon the prophet\u2019s challenge and that is\nhighly unexpected albeit not strictly a violation of the natural\norder. For example, the occurrence of a plague, which ensues after the\nprophet predicts it. Also, the very inimitability of the Qur\u2019an\n(i\u02bfj\u0101z) seems to fall within this category and\noften is cited as the only, yet most convincing, proof of\nMuhammad\u2019s claim to prophethood.\n\n\nAnd if you are in any doubt about what we (God) have sent down to our\nservant, produce a s\u016bra of the like of [this\nQur\u2019an]. (Qur\u2019an 2:23; also see 11:13, 10:38, 17:88 and\n52: 34)\n\n\nThose who were so challenged apparently were impotent to rise to the\nchallenge. The second class of extraordinary events requires the\nactual suspension of natural laws. Examples include, the virgin birth\nand the raising of the dead back to life. (Peterson et al. 2013:\n208\u20139). To distinguish this class from the first, let us call\nthem \u2018supernatural\u2019 miracles or events, namely, something\nthat is both extra-ordinary and indeed outside of the natural order of\nthings.\n\nAlthough many, if not most, medieval Islamic scholars acknowledged\nprophetic miracles, the issue of whether there truly were both kinds\nof miracles remained an important topic of discussion. The theologians\nchampioned the position that there are both kinds. The philosophers,\nwhile not denying that extraordinary acts confirm one\u2019s\nprophethood, maintained that although miracles are exceptionally rare,\nthey remain part of the natural order, and so they held a position\nabout miracles much like the naturalized view of prophecy. Let us look\nat the philosophers\u2019 position and then turn to the\ntheologians\u2019 response to it.\n\nIbn S\u012bn\u0101\u2019s position may be highlighted here (Avicenna\nDA: 198\u2013200 & ITN2: 105; also see Davidson 1992: 121\u20132\nand Al-Akiti 2004). For Ibn S\u012bn\u0101, performing miracles is one\nof three properties that identify a prophet. We have already seen the\nother two, namely, (1) to divine future and/or absent events and (2)\nto relate religious truths in symbolic form that all can grasp. Ibn\nS\u012bn\u0101 explains miracles in much the same way that he explains\nthese other two properties of the prophet. The intellect and\nimagination of prophets are of the highest degree possible for humans,\nand so the prophet fully grasps and understands the order of the good\nthat has its ultimate sources in the divine emanation. Additionally,\nIbn S\u012bn\u0101 recognizes the well-established fact that\none\u2019s mind and emotions can produce psychosomatic responses even\nin people of limited intellectual power; however, while for the most\nparts these responses are limited to one\u2019s own body, in the case\nof the prophets their minds can affect other bodies, whether animate\nor inanimate. In so doing, they can cause winds to blow, or rains to\nfall and even earthquake as well as healing or bringing illness on\nothers. While for us to day the Avicennan account of miracles might\nappear to border on the occult, within the scientific framework in\nwhich he was working, his position provided a legitimate natural\nexplanation of what otherwise could only be called the miraculous. To\nbe sure, not all philosophers accepted Ibn S\u012bn\u0101\u2019s\nsuggested naturalistic mechanism to explain the apparently miraculous.\nStill, few denied miracles outright. Thus, even Ibn Rushd apparently\nallowed that there are miracles\u2014as seen in the\nmiraculous practical value of the laws and religious claims embodied\nin Qur\u2019an\u2014while remaining virtually silent on how\nsuch a miracle as the Qur\u2019an could occur.\n\nGhaz\u0101l\u012b provides the theologians\u2019 response to the\nphilosophers in his Incoherence of the Philosophers\n(Ghaz\u0101l\u012b Incoherence, disc. 17; also see Fakhry\n1958: 56\u201378; Marmura 1989; L\u00f3pez-Farjeat 2016:\n131\u2013140). To begin, the Qur\u2019an contains accounts of\nmiracles, some of which clearly appear to be of the supernatural kind,\ne.g., the virgin birth and resurrection from the dead. A literal\nreading of these miracle-stories requires violations of essential or\nnatural causation, that is, regular, non-divine causal series that\npurportedly necessitate their effects. Ghaz\u0101l\u012b complains\nthat on the philosophers\u2019 account, the Quranic stories of\nsupernatural miracles cannot be taken literally.\n\n\nWhoever renders the habitual courses [of nature] a necessary constant,\nmakes all these [miracles] impossible. [The philosophers] have thus\ninterpreted what is said in the Qur\u2019an about the revivification\nof the dead metaphorically. (Ghaz\u0101l\u012b Incoherence,\n163 [23])\n\n\nWhile again Ghaz\u0101l\u012b allows for limited metaphorical readings\nof the Qur\u2019an, he does so only in those cases where he believes\nthat the literal sense leads to a genuine absurdity or even\ncontradiction. For example, Quranic passage that when taken literally\nimply that God has a body, for Ghaz\u0101l\u012b, must be read\nmetaphorically, for to be embodied is to be limited and yet\nGod is unlimited. Miracles of the supernatural kind, that is,\nviolations of natural causation and necessitation, in contrast, do not\ninvolve absurdities or outright contradictions. They are admittedly\nrare, but seemingly possible. Moreover, as we have seen, the\ntheologians view natural causation as nothing more than presumption on\nthe part of the philosophers, preferring occasionalism instead. Thus,\nfor Ghaz\u0101l\u012b, absent a proof for the impossibility of\nsupernatural miracles, one should accept the Qur\u2019anic stories as\nliteral accounts of real events. Still, Ghaz\u0101l\u012b does not\nultimately believe that these supernatural miracles should be the\nonly, even the primary, basis for one\u2019s belief in the veracity\nof the Qur\u2019an and Muhammad\u2019s prophethood\n(Ghaz\u0101l\u012b al-Munqidh, 41\u20134\n[Deliverance, 83\u20137]). As for the true proof for the\ninspired nature of the Qur\u2019an, Ghaz\u0101l\u012b, in a way that\nforeshadows and even may have influenced Ibn Rushd\u2019s views,\npoints to the effect of a careful study of the Qur\u2019an and the\ntraditions surrounding Muhammad, the effect of which is the\npurification of hearts (ta\u1e63fiyat al-qul\u016bb) Both\nthe miraculous and the practical confirm the divine sovereignty and\ngovernance of all events and testify to the prophetic and miraculous\nnature of the Qur\u2019an.\n5. The Problem of evil\n\nOne of the important problems for Abrahamic religions is to explain\nthe presence of evil given the assumption that an all-wise, all-just,\nall-powerful and all-loving God created and is continuously conserving\nthe world. Modern philosophical discussions of the so-called problem\nof evil frequently focus on whether the presence of evil provides\nevidence against the existence of such a God, and so against classical\nmonotheism more generally. In contrast, for medieval Muslim\nphilosophers and theologians, the existence of God was never in\nquestion. Instead, \u2018the problem\u2019 of evil for these\nthinkers is a cluster of related issues, not the least of which is\n\u201cWhat is evil?\u201d and \u201cIs our world the best possible\nworld?\u201d Additionally, these thinkers wanted to reconcile the\ndivine attributes with the presence of evil or to determine which of\nthe divine attributes, particularly between divine justice and\nGod\u2019s omnipotence, trumps the others.\n\nOne strategy for explaining the presence of evil was to emphasize\nGod\u2019s transcendence and sovereignty over the universe.\nConsidering human actions, we judge that some cases of causing others\npain are justified, e.g., in disciplining someone or administering\njustice, while others are not, e.g., gratuitous violence. Given the\nbelief that God created the universe and controls the course of events\nin the world, how can we explain the suffering that animals,\nespecially humans, undergo? In this regard, some argued that the\nethical rules applicable among humans are not applicable to God.\nSupporters of this account, predeterminists (jabriyya),\nemphasize that the relation between God and the universe is one\nbetween property and owner. Just as a person can do what he wants with\nhis property, so also God has the right to treat his property in\nwhatever way he wants (\u02bfAbd al-Jabb\u0101r SUK: 483\u20135).\nAb\u016b al-\u1e24asan \u02bfAl\u012b b. Ism\u0101\u02bf\u012bl\nal-Ash\u02bfar\u012b (d. 935/6), founder of the Ash\u02bfarite\ntheological school, seems to have defended such a position at an early\nstage in his career. He highlights God\u2019s absolute control over\nthe course of events in the world (Ash\u02bfar\u012b EIF: 50\u20131).\nThus, the suffering that affects animals and humans, does not need any\nfurther justification, since the universe is God\u2019s property and\nGod can treat creatures the way he pleases. He can punish an innocent\nperson and can hold people responsible to do that which they cannot do\n(Ash\u02bfar\u012b EIF: 111\u201313).\n\nInstead of emphasizing God\u2019s sovereignty over creation, another\napproach, which is usually associated with Mu\u02bftazilite\ntheologians, is to consider if there is any reason that justifies an\ninstance of suffering independent of whether the cause of that\nsuffering is God or a human agent (see Hourani 1971 and Vasalou 2008).\nIf one understands evil as unjustified suffering, then in such cases\nof suffering where there is a valid justification\u2014like a certain\nderived benefit or as punishment\u2014the suffering cannot be\nconsidered evil, at least not in the sense of unjustified suffering\n(\u02bfAbd al-Jabb\u0101r SUK: 485\u20136). Consequently, in\nconsidering whether some case of suffering is evil, one must take into\naccount, not only the conditions of the agent, that is, whether God or\na creature caused it, but also whether there are justifying reasons\nfor the suffering. Since God is good and just, there must be reasons\njustifying any instance of suffering that is traced back to the divine\naction\u2014excluding human free actions. Mu\u02bftazilite\ntheologians identified some of these reason as compensation\n(\u02bfiwa\u1e0d), admonition (\u02bfibr),\npunishment, some kind of benefit (ma\u1e63la\u1e25a) or\neven grace (lu\u1e6df) (\u02bfAbd al-Jabb\u0101r SUK:\n487\u20139 and Ibn al-Mal\u0101him\u012b al-F\u0101\u02beiq,\n261\u201374). Thus, the Mu\u02bftazilite theologians argued that the\nexistence of suffering in the world is compatible with the goodness,\ngenerosity and justice of God.\n\nThe standards by which Mu\u02bftazilite theologians evaluate what is\ngood and just is the same for both God and humans. Their objective\nstandard of goodness and justice had further implications about the\npresence of evil in our world. One notable implication is that God\nmust do what is best (a\u1e63la\u1e25). Initially certain\nMu\u02bftazilites maintained that God must do what is best only in\nreligious matters, namely, commands and prohibitions (Ibn Mattawayh\nal-Tadhkira, II, 332\u20133, 360). Ultimately, most\nMu\u02bftazilite theologians came to agree that since God is generous\nand good, he does what is best in all his actions, whether religious\nmatters or creating and ordering the universe (Ibn\nal-Mal\u0101him\u012b al-F\u0101\u02beiq, 119 and \u02bfAbd\nal-Jabb\u0101r al-A\u1e63la\u1e25: XIV, 53). Consequently,\neven if the Mu\u02bftazilite theologians do not emphasize this\nimplication, for them this world is the best possible world.\n\nThe Neoplatonic-inspired philosophers, like F\u0101r\u0101b\u012b and\nIbn S\u012bn\u0101, had yet another strategy to explain the presence\nof evil, which Ibn S\u012bn\u0101 exemplifies well\n(F\u0101r\u0101b\u012b al-Ta\u02bfl\u012bq\u0101t, \u00a739\nand Avicenna MetaH: 9.6, 339\u201347). Ibn S\u012bn\u0101 takes up\nthe problem of evil within the context of divine providence (see above\n \u00a73.2.1).\n The question is how can the existence of evil in the universe be\nexplained, if the whole universe emanates from an absolutely good God?\nFollowing the Neoplatonist tradition, he associates goodness with\nexistence or being and evil with non-being or the imperfection of\nbeing proper to a thing. Since evil is in a sense a non-thing, and the\nnon-existent does not have a cause, it is a category mistake to ask\nwhat is the cause of evil absolutely speaking or to suggest that God\ncauses. it.\n\nStill, Ibn S\u012bn\u0101 recognizes that some apparent evils, most\nnotably suffering, cannot simply be reduced to imperfections and the\nprivation of a proper existence. There are events, or conditions, that\nactively can cause suffering. Ibn S\u012bn\u0101 argues that evil as\nsuffering is applicable only to a small part of the whole universe,\nand yet is indispensable to that part, a \u2018necessary evil\u2019,\nif you will. This part of the universe consists of things that are\nsubject to generation and corruption. The sphere of generation and\ncorruption, according to Neoplatonic cosmology, is limited to the\nEarth, its inhabitants and the immediate atmosphere enveloping the\nEarth. Thus, in order for there to be absolutely no evil in the entire\ncosmos the sphere of generation and corruption either would have\nneeded not to exist or to be deprived of the properties that make\ngenerable and corruptible things what they are. Divine providence\nprecludes both options, Ibn S\u012bn\u0101 argues, for roughly the\nsame reason in both cases, namely, the universe overall would be less\ngood than it actually is, even given the presence of some evil. An\nexample drawn from Ibn S\u012bn\u0101 clarifies his point. Certainly,\na poor man who loses his family and possessions to a fire, suffers an\nevil. Yet the fact that fire is essentially hot, so as to cook flesh\nand to burn wood, is in itself good. Likewise, that wood and flesh are\nessentially such as to be cooked by fire are in themselves good. To\neliminate fire\u2019s power to burn and the powers by which wood and\nflesh are cooked is to eliminate those very things. Thus, to eliminate\nthe possibility of this kind of suffering would be to eliminate an\nentire class of existents, namely, those subject to generation and\ncorruption. Consequently, an entire class of objective good in the\nuniverse would be lost, and so make the world overall less good. For\nIbn S\u012bn\u0101, such a loss is simply incompatible with his\nconception of divine providence, God is ultimately the source of an\norder that is the most perfectly possible commensurate with the chain\nof all possible existents.\n\nWhile both Ibn S\u012bn\u0101\u2019s and the Mu\u02bftazilite\nexplanations of the presence of evil imply that God has created the\nbest possible world, neither explicitly make this claim in their\nworks. It was Ghaz\u0101l\u012b, who explicitly argued that the actual\nworld is the best of all possible worlds (see Ormsby 1984). \u201cIn\nthe realm of the possible\u201d, Ghaz\u0101l\u012b assures us,\n\n\nthere is nothing at all more wondrously beautiful than [this world]\nnor more complete nor more perfect (laysa f\u012b-l-imk\u0101n\nabda\u02bf a\u1e63lan a\u1e25sana minhu wa l\u0101 atamma wa l\u0101\nakmala)\n\n\nor as it was popularized in the rhyming couplet,\n\n\nIn the realm of all the possible, nothing than what is is more\nwonderful. (laysa f\u012b-l-imk\u0101n abda\u02bf mimm\u0101\nk\u0101n) (Ghaz\u0101l\u012b FDU: 45\u20136 and\nGhaz\u0101l\u012b Forty Principles, 259)\n\n\nThe imperfection that we see in the world is a result of the limits of\nour knowledge. The reason that this must be the best possible world is\nbecause if a better universe were possible and God did not create it,\nyet could have created it, he would have been miserly; however, God is\nomnibenevolent, and so this claim must be false. If God did not create\nthis purportedly better possible world because he could not do so,\nthen God would be impotent in some respect; however, God is\nomnipotent, and so this claim must be false. In short, none of these\nor similar options for explaining a less than optimal world are\nacceptable, for they all impugn God\u2019s majesty. To be sure,\nGhaz\u0101l\u012b is not claiming that there is no evil in the world;\nrather, for him, evil, as imperfection and suffering, is an essential\ningredient of the perfection of the world. While we might not fully\nrecognize how certain specific cases of evil contribute to the\nworld\u2019s overall perfection, nonetheless, those very\nimperfections can help one appreciate the contrasting good in the\nworld. Thus the actual universe, with the evil included in it, is the\nbest possible universe.\n6. Religious/theological language\n\nTheological language has a special status that presents a challenge\nfor thinkers particularly within the Abrahamic traditions since God is\nconsidered to be completely different from creation, while our\nlanguage applies mainly, if not solely, to creatures. Thus, to express\nwhat and how God is proves a difficult challenge. The follow section\nconsiders earlier Islamic approaches to understanding theological\nlanguage and how to read the Qur\u2019an\u2019s claims about God.\nThe next section\n (\u00a76.2)\n considers how later Muslim philosophers and the various schools of\nMuslim theologians developed these approaches with an eye to their\ndiscussions of the divine attributes.\n6.1 Early approaches to theological language\n\nThe earliest developments in Islamic theological language emphasized\nGod\u2019s absolute unity/simplicity (taw\u1e25\u012bd) and\nperhaps most importantly, since God is unlike creatures\n(mukh\u0101lafa li-l-\u1e25aw\u0101dith), his transcendence\n(tanz\u012bh). The proponents of divine transcendence, the\neponymous Jahmiyya, named after the movement\u2019s founder Jahm ibn\n\u1e62afw\u0101n (696\u2013745), denied that God has any attributes\n(see Sch\u00f6ck 2016: 55\u201377). Consequently, critics referred to\nthese theologians as apophaticists\n(Mu\u02bfa\u1e6d\u1e6dila, literally, \u2018those who\nvoid\u2019) to indicate that this position voids religious texts of\ntheir literal meaning since God transcends anything that we can say or\nunderstand about him. In response to this emphasis on divine\ntranscendence, there emerged those who stressed a hyper-literal\nreading of Qur\u2019anic verses\u2014such as Qur\u2019an 48: 10\n& 38, 71; 2: 115 and 11: 37 with their references to God\u2019s\nhands, face and eyes respectively\u2014and the prophetic traditions.\nBased on a literal reading, they made God similar to creatures and\nascribed to him a physical body, and so were labeled anthropomorphists\n(mushabbiha, literally, \u2018simulators\u2019) and\ncorporealists (mujassima) (see Van Ess 2000). A reaction to\nthese two earlier positions was that of the traditionalist\n(salaf\u012b) who claimed to follow the example of the\nearliest generation (salaf) of Muslims, i.e., the companions\nof the Prophet and the followers of the companions. They attempted to\nprovide a middle path between the apophatic and anthropomorphic\nunderstandings of God. They wanted neither to void the Qur\u2019an of\nits literal meaning by emphasizing divine transcendence nor to make\nGod similar to bodily creatures by taking the Qur\u2019an out of its\nbroader theological context. In general, they maintained that while\none knows that God has the various anthropomorphic characters\nthat the Qur\u2019an attributes to him, one should not delve into\nhow (kayf) God has those attributes, i.e., their\nmode of existence. All the major approaches developed later in the\nmedieval Islamic world, such as those of the Mu\u02bftazilites,\nAsh\u02bfarites, Maturidites and philosophers, can be traced back to\nand are modifications of these three approaches (Winter 2008:\n33\u2013141; Rudolph 1996 [2015]: 23\u2013121; and Watt 1973:\n242\u201350, 279\u2013318; 1992: 46\u201355, 64\u201397).\n\nUnderlying the apophatic, anthropomorphic and traditionalist positions\nabout divine attributes is a common assumption, namely, when one talks\nabout God and about creation, one must use univocal language. In other\nwords, it was assumed that if language is to be literal and\ninformative, properties predicated of God and of creatures must have\nexactly the same sense. Thus, if, as the Qur\u2019an purports, God\nhas hands, eyes and speaks, having hands, eyes and speaking must have\none the same meaning when predicated of God and of creatures. For\nMuslim Apophatic theologians, since we cannot take attributes\npredicated of God univocally in the way they are predicated of\ncreation, we must take them as negations about God. Conversely,\ngranting the assumption of univocal predication, Muslim\nanthropomorphists maintained it is legitimate to draw the implications\nthat God has bodily parts similar to those of creatures from the\nQur\u2019anic statements about God. Muslim Traditionalists, with the\nsame assumption, affirmed the literal meaning of religious texts that\npredicate of God creaturely properties, but they understood them as\ngoverned by the principle that God is unlike creation, and so those\nproperties that are found in creation and predicated of God may be\nacknowledged without additionally drawing their ordinary\nimplications.\n6.2 Theological language and the divine attributes\n\nIssues associated with how God or the divine self (dh\u0101t)\nis related to his properties or attributes (\u1e63if\u0101t)\ndrove further developments among medieval Islamic scholars. One common\nclassification of the divine attributes was into (1) essential\nproperties or attributes (\u1e63if\u0101t bi-dh\u0101t) and\n(2) properties of action (\u1e63if\u0101t bi-fi\u02bfl).\nEssential properties in turn are divided into negative\n(salb\u012b) properties and \u2018properties of\nma\u02bfn\u012b\u2019, that is, properties with a positive\n(thub\u016bt\u012b) meaning, and so add some further sense to\nwhat it is to be God. Negative properties indicate God\u2019s\ntranscendence and include unity, eternity (qidam), permanence\n(baq\u0101\u02be), self-subsistence (qiy\u0101m bi\nnafsihi), dissimilarity to the creation (mukh\u0101lafa\nli-l-\u1e25aw\u0101dith) and one may also include simplicity,\nalthough it is not usually included in the list. This list consists of\n\u2018formal properties\u2019 in the sense that they do not indicate\nany perfection per se but an absence of limitations on God,\ne.g., non-temporal, immutable and non-dependent (Burrell 1986:\n46\u201350). In general, all of these negative properties express a\ndissimilarity to creation, since each one of them indicates how God is\nnot like creation in a certain respect. The positive\nproperties (properties of ma\u02bf\u0101n\u012b) include\npower (qudra), will (ir\u0101da), knowledge\n(\u02bfilm), life (\u1e25ay\u0101t), speech\n(kal\u0101m), hearing (sam\u02bf) and sight\n(ba\u1e63ar). Properties of action include creation and the\nconservation of the universe, commanding, determining what happens\n(qadar) in the universe, etc. Positive properties and\nproperties of action imply some similarity to creation. One may add as\nanother sub-category of properties found in the Qur\u2019an those\nthat necessarily imply similarity with creaturely existence, like\nhaving a face, eyes, being seated, etc. In general later Muslim\ntheologians and philosophers understood this last set of properties\nmetaphorically. How to understand the sense and status of the divine\nessential properties with a positive meaning, however, remained an\nimportant problem for medieval Muslim scholars. The three most\nprominent and developed views were those of the Mu\u02bftazilite\ntheologians, the Ash\u02bfarite and Maturidite theologians and the\nphilosophers. Let us consider each school in turn.\n6.2.1 The Mu\u02bftazilites and theological language\n\nMu\u02bftazilite theologians strongly emphasized both God\u2019s\ndissimilarity to creation and his absolute oneness or simplicity. They\nask one to consider the properties or perfections found in humans and\nalso attributed to God, like, knowledge, power and will. As these\nproperties exist in humans there is a distinction between the thing\nthat possesses the perfections and the perfections themselves. Is the\nsame true of God? The answer for the Mu\u02bftazilites is a resounding\n\u2018no!\u2019 That is because if the divine attributes are\ndistinct from the divine self, then there would be a multiplicity of\ndivine, eternal entities, namely, the eternal and divine subject of\nattribution and the eternal and divine attributes. Consequently, they\nconclude, divine oneness and unity is lost and indeed one sinks into a\nform of polytheism far from the monotheism of Islam, a position that\nthe Mu\u02bftazilites found wholly untenable. For Mu\u02bftazilites,\nthe relation between God\u2019s self and his attributes must be\neither one of negation (salb), namely, to deny that God is in\nany way limited in the way creatures are, or one of identity, namely,\nthe divine attributes are not distinct from the divine self that bears\nthose attributes.\n\nIn the case of interpreting divine attributes as negations,\nMu\u02bftazilites modified a version of the earlier Muslim\napophaticists. For instance, to say that \u201cGod is knowing\u201d,\nmeans that God is not ignorant\u201d, or to say that \u201cGod is\npowerful\u201d means that \u201cGod is not weak or not\npowerless\u201d. The rest of the divine attributes are interpreted\nalong the same lines (Ash\u02bfar\u012b MI: 155\u201377, 183\u20135\n& 486 and \u02bfAbd al-Jabb\u0101r SUK: 182\u2013213). Such\nattributions are helpful in understanding and speaking about God in\njust they way that eliminating possible choices from a multiple-choice\nquestion is helpful. One with such negative knowledge is certainly in\na better position than one who does not possesses it or is merely\nguessing or who wrongly believes that they know what is true.\nMoreover, informative, negative ascriptions do not require assigning\nto God a plurality of distinct positive properties, which in fact are\nmore fitting of creatures. Thus, in the case of negative ascriptions,\nboth God\u2019s transcendence and simplicity are safeguarded.\n\nAs for identifying God\u2019s self and attributes, Mu\u02bftazilites\nbegan by acknowledging that human language cannot avoid distinguishing\na subject and the properties predicated of that subject, and indeed\nthe Qur\u2019an addresses humans in human language. This feature is a\nlimit of human language and our cognitive capacities but not of God.\nIn the case of God, there is an identity of the subject and\nperfections predicated of the divine subject, even though human\nthinking and speaking cannot avoid distinguishing these as separate\n(Ash\u02bfar\u012b MI: 155\u201385 and \u02bfAbd al-Jabb\u0101r SUK:\n182\u2013213). Unfortunately, identifying the divine properties of\nperfection with God Himself is not as simple as it might first appear.\nIf divine properties are identical to God, then they must be identical\nto each other, and yet, for example, despite adages to the contrary,\nknowledge seems to be truly distinct from power. Additionally, if God\nis identical to his properties, God would be a property, which hardly\nseems like an object worthy of worship (Ghaz\u0101l\u012b\nIncoherence, discs. 5\u20136; cf. Plantinga 1980:\n26\u201361 and McGinnis 2022).\n\nOne Mu\u02bftazilite response to this objection was that of Ab\u016b\n\u1e24\u0101shim al-Jubb\u0101\u02be\u012b (d. 933). In order to\nexplain, both why and how identifying positive properties with God\ndoes not lead to these absurdities, he argued that such properties are\nlike states (a\u1e25w\u0101l) of an entity\u2014e.g.,\nsitting\u2014which can differ depending upon how one considers them.\nThus, if a state is taken on its own, it does not really exist out\nthere\u2014there is no \u2018sitting\u2019 that exists out there\nsimply as sitting. Still, the fact that a state as some independent\nproperty does not exist out there does not mean that it is an\nabsolutely non-existent; rather, it exists by virtue of the existence\nof the entity in that state. Thus, to say that \u201cGod is\nknowing\u201d is to indicate a certain state of God and to say that\n\u201cGod is powerful\u201d is to indicate another state of God, yet\nin neither case, does the state indicate what God himself is\n(\u02bfAbd al-Jabb\u0101r SUK: 128\u20139; also see Schmidtke 2016a:\n162\u20134).\n6.2.2 Ash\u02bfarites/Maturidites and theological language\n\nAsh\u02bfarite and Maturidite theologians accused the Mu\u02bftazilite\ntheologians of all the problems following upon identifying the divine\nself and its attributes implies, such as the loss of distinction among\nthe divine attributes and that ultimately God would be identical with\na property. In opposition to the Mu\u02bftazilites, the Ash\u02bfarite\nand Maturidite theologians affirmed the distinction between the\npositive divine attributes, like knowledge, power and will, and God as\nthe bearer of those attributes. Thus, the problem facing them was to\nexplain how a multiplicity of divine things, and so a violation of\ndivine oneness, does not ensue if God\u2019s self and his distinct\nproperties of perfection are all divine and eternal.\n\nThey adopted two main strategies to address this problem. One early\nstrategy was to argue that properties predicated of God with some\npositive connotation\u2014properties that are not simply\nnegations\u2014are neither different from nor identical to the divine\nself. One challenge to such a view is that it seems to violate the Law\nof Excluded Middle, for a divine attribute must either be identical to\nthe divine self or not identical to it, in which case it would be\ndifferent from the divine self. Two early Ash\u02bfarite theologians,\nB\u0101qill\u0101n\u012b and Juwayn\u012b, apparently tried to adopt\nthe Mu\u02bftazilite theory of states to address this concern.\nConsidered in themselves, the divine attributes are not identical to\nGod, while considered relative to God\u2019s possession of those\nattributes they are identical to God (Shahrast\u0101n\u012b\nal-Milal, I 82 & Summa, 52\u201360; F. D.\nR\u0101z\u012b Opinions, 61\u20134 and\nTaft\u0101z\u0101n\u012b Creed, 51\u20135).\n\nAnother way that Ash\u02bfarites and Maturidites attempted to observe\ndivine transcendence while upholding the meaningfulness of theological\nlanguage was to emphasize that when an attribute is predicated of God,\n\u201cGod is not like others that have that attribute\u201d. For\nexample, al-M\u0101tur\u012bd\u012b, in his Kit\u0101b\nal-Taw\u1e25\u012bd, begins by criticizing the anthropomorphic\nposition by indicating certain shortcomings of conceiving God in a\nmanner similar to creation (M\u0101tur\u012bd\u012b KT: 43\u20137;\nalso see Rudolph 1996 [2015: 282\u20134]). He then explains how God\nis unlike creation. When properties predicated of creation are\npredicated of God, they are used in such a way that all the creaturely\nimplications are stripped off; they are, as it were, a \u2018winnowed\nconcept\u2019 (cf. Alston 1985). He also acknowledges that in order\nto know God, we must use the language that is used to talk about\ncreatures. Accordingly, we predicate perfections of God, but take into\naccount the principle that God is unlike creatures. For example, one\nmay say \u201cGod knows but His knowledge is unlike, knowledge\nbelonging to creatures\u201d. This way of predicating attributes of\nGod also found supporters among Mu\u02bftazilite theologians, like\n\u02bfAbd al-Jabbar, who offers and defends the same strategy and\nformula. The strategy, however, has its challenges, for if one\ninterprets \u2018unlike\u2019 in the strict sense, theological\nlanguage seems to lose its informative function, while if it is not\ntaken in a strict sense, it is not clear that divine transcendence is\nsecured.\n6.2.3 Philosophers and theological language\n\nTo varying degrees most, if not all, philosophers accepted some form\nof a negative theology when discussing the divine attributes\n(Kind\u012b PWK: \u201cOn First Philosophy\u201d, \u00a7\u00a7\nXIX\u2013XX; F\u0101r\u0101b\u012b Perfect State, ch. 1; and\nAvicenna MetaH: 8.4). For them, many, if not all, of the attributes\nascribed to God are in fact merely descriptions of ways that God is\nunlimited or infinite in some respect or other. The\nphilosophers\u2019 general strategy is the same as the\nMu\u02bftazilites (see\n \u00a76.2.1),\n where the basic idea, again, is that negative ascriptions, while\ninformative, do not involve God\u2019s necessarily possessing a\nplurality of positive attributes, which would jeopardize both divine\nsimplicity and God\u2019s transcendence.\n\nCertain philosophers, like Ibn S\u012bn\u0101 and Ibn Rushd, likewise\nrepeated the Mu\u02bftazilite position that the divine self is\nidentical with its essential attributes, like life, knowledge and\npower (Avicenna al-Naj\u0101t, 264 = MR07: 214 & MetaH:\n1.7 & 8.4 and Ibn Rushd Tahafut, 299\u2013301 [1954:\n177\u20139]). Ibn Rushd notes that in a limited sense this\nidentification of some entity with its essential attributes is true\neven of creatures. He provides the example of the definition of\n\u2018man\u2019 as a \u2018rational animal\u2019. Both rationality\nand animality are parts of the definition of \u2018man\u2019, but\nthey are not distinct parts constituting the flesh-and-blood man in\nthe world in the way that color and shape are. This analogy is not to\nsuggest that one can have a definition of God, which Ibn Rushd flatly\ndenies, but only to indicate that the way humans conceive an entity\nneeds not perfectly reflect how that entity exists in the world.\nIndeed, Ibn Rushd goes further and provides a principled Aristotelian\nreason why no creature could ever form a definition of God or fully\ngrasp the divinity (Ibn Rushd Tahafut, 345\u20136 [1954:\n207]). He notes that according to Aristotelian principles to grasp\nwhat a thing is essentially, so as to be able to have a definition,\nrequires that in some sense the intellect becomes the very thing\ngrasped. Thus, since a finite human intellect can never grasp the\ninfinite\u2014indeed, to whatever extent it does grasp it, the very\nact of grasping it limits it so that it is finite in the human\nintellect\u2014it can never form a definition of God nor fully grasp\nGod\u2019s essential existence. Thus, by necessity the human\nintellect conceives a plurality of attributes in its conception of God\nwhere in fact none exists. Admittedly, this discussion comes from one\nof Ibn Rushd\u2019s popular works and not from one intended solely\nfor the philosophers, and so whether it presents his considered view\non the subject remains unclear. As for Ibn S\u012bn\u0101, he is more\nforthcoming, arguing that all the various (positive) essential\nattributes said of God really are nothing more than alternative\ndescriptions of a single reality, namely, necessary existence through\nitself (w\u0101jib al-wuj\u016bd bi-dh\u0101tihi), which is\nidentical with and unique to God.\n7. Ethics in Islam\n\nIn addition to the role of reason in justifying specific ethical\njudgments like what is morally right and wrong (al-\u1e25usn\nwa-l-qub\u1e25)\u2014a discussion that mirrors those about\nreason and faith in Islam more generally\n (\u00a71.2)\u2014Muslim\n thinkers also were concerned with the ontological status of normative\nproperties, like goodness and badness (see Emon 2010). With respect to\nthis issue, one asks whether ethical facts exist independently of God\nor do they originate from and have their morally binding force as a\nresult of a divine command. On the one hand, if the demands of morally\ngood and bad actions are independent of God, then is God subject to\nthose demands or not? If so, then does God observe them as a matter of\nnecessity, in which case God\u2019s power seems limited, or does he\nobserve them as a matter of will or choice, in which case were he not\nto observe them would he be morally bad, since again these demands\ndetermine morally good and bad actions? On the other hand, if ethical\ndicta have their source and force in God\u2019s commanding them,\ncould God have commanded contrary to what he did and so invert right\nand wrong? For example, could God have commanded us to lie, in which\ncase lying would have been obligatory and even morally good?\n7.1 The Mu\u02bftazilites on the morally right and wrong (al-\u1e25usn wa-l-qub\u1e25)\n\nMu\u02bftazilite theologians defended the view that reason can acquire\na knowledge of what is morally right and wrong, precisely because\nstandards of right and wrong are purportedly objective and not\narbitrary, and so are independent of God\u2019s merely commanding\nthem. Their views are laid out within the context of moral\nresponsibility (see Hourani 1971 & 1985 and Vasalou 2008). For\nMu\u02bftazilite theologians, while perhaps reason cannot discover all\nof those actions for which one is religiously responsible in order to\nbe a devout Muslim (such as praying five times daily or avoiding\npork), one could come to know the more general ethical human\nresponsibilities (such as avoiding lying and honoring one\u2019s\nbenefactor). This is because according to the Mu\u02bftazilites, the\nproperties that make an action good or bad, and for which one is\nmorally responsible, are objective qualities relative to the action,\nto the consequence(s) of the action or to the agent of the action.\nThese moral properties are objective precisely because we\nobserve\u2014whether through self-reflection or inference from the\noutward behavior of others\u2014the benefit or the harm that an\naction causes. Thus, in a consequentialist vein, these\nMu\u02bftazilites relate the morally good with what is genuinely\nbeneficial and the morally bad with what is harmful. Religion then\nconfirms what reason knows about the moral status of an action and its\nconsequence(s).\n\nSince for these thinkers the ethical status of an action does not\ndepend on a divine command, the question arises whether God is bound\nto behave ethically. \u02bfAbd al-Jabb\u0101r argued that ethical\ndemands are binding and applicable not only to human agents but also\nto God and his action as well (\u02bfAbd al-Jabb\u0101r\nal-Ta\u02bfd\u012bl: 52\u201370). Thus, he argues that if\none denies that God is bound to do and to command the morally good,\nthe commands and prohibitions given in scripture would be not only\narbitrary but possibly even mutable and unreliable. For example, if\none allowed that God could lie, then God or the prophets could be\nlying about what is required for salvation or what leads to damnation,\nin which case all the religious teaching would be under suspicion, a\nposition which that \u02bfAbd al-Jabb\u0101r simply found\nunacceptable.\n7.2 Responses to the Mu\u02bftazilites\n\nMost medieval Muslim thinkers, whether philosophers, theologians or\nSufis, recognized some need for religion in order to possess a\ncomplete understanding of things ethical. Although they generally\ngranted that humans have some intuitive recognition of virtues and\nwhat is morally good and bad, they emphasized that various human\nconditions limit our ability always to judge correctly about the\nethical status of particular actions. One such limit is our inherent\ncognitive limits. Thus, the Sufi master Ibn \u02bfArab\u012b complains\nthat because the moral goodness or badness of actions may depend on\ncertain conditions that human reason cannot comprehended, divine\nrevelation is needed to inform us of the ethical status of our actions\n(Ibn al-\u02bfArab\u012b al-Fut\u016b\u1e25\u0101t\nal-Makkiyya (b), I 459\u201360 & VII 326). For instance,\nwhat we \u2018observe\u2019 or judge to be a benefit may, all things\nconsidered, actually be harmful and similarly for our judgments about\nwhat is harmful. Only from a \u2018God\u2019s eye perspective\u2019\ncan one be assured that in fact all things have been considered. In\naddition to our inherent cognitive limits, personal and social\nconditions affect the reliability of our ethical judgments. For\nexample, the Sunni jurist, \u1e24ak\u012bm al-Tirmidh\u012b (d. ca.\n869), noted that while reason has some share in making sound moral\njudgments, selfishness and the human desire for material benefits and\npleasures hinders our ability always to reason correctly and\nobjectively about what is ethically right and wrong (Tirmidh\u012b\nKit\u0101b Ithb\u0101t al-\u02bfilal, 67\u201378).\nF\u0101r\u0101b\u012b and Ibn S\u012bn\u0101 identify yet another\nhuman condition that requires religion to aid reason in determining\nright ethical rules. They maintained that ethical and political\njudgments are not a priori necessary truths, but well-known\nand commonly accepted specific rules\n(taf\u1e63\u012bl\u0101t) acquired from attending to various\npractices over long periods of time. Thus, without knowing this\nsocio-cultural history that religion preserves, one cannot know what\nis efficacious for living a good and virtuous life here on earth\n(F\u0101r\u0101b\u012b Perfect State, 77\u20138 and Avicenna\nMetaH: 10.2\u20134; also see Erlwein 2019).\n\nAsh\u02bfarite and Maturidite theologians in general vehemently\ncriticized the Mu\u02bftazilite position that reason alone can\ndiscover even general ethical demands incumbent upon humans and God\nalike. Their criticisms highlight the unacceptable theological\nimplications of the Mu\u02bftazilite position and the inherent limits\nof human reason. The most common criticism comes from the theological\nimplication that God is compelled or obligated to do the good. Recall\nthat the general Mu\u02bftazilite position, as \u02bfAbd\nal-Jabb\u0101r articulated it, holds that good and bad are inherent\nproperties of actions regardless of their agents, and so since God is\ngood, God is morally compelled to do good. One obvious implication of\nthis view is that if God cannot do bad actions, then God\u2019s power\nis limited, and so God is not wholly omnipotent. From a theological\npoint of view, Ash\u02bfarite theologians found this implication\nunacceptable. Consequently, they denied that good and bad are inherent\nproperties of actions and instead demanded that all ethical standards\nare dependent on what God himself commands.\n\nAs for criticisms against the Mu\u02bftazilite position from the\nnature of human reason, Ash\u02bfarite and Maturidites theologians\navailed themselves of all the argument we have already seen about the\nlimits of our cognitive capacities and the constraints of our human\ncondition. Thus, for example, M\u0101tur\u012bd\u012b presses the\npoint that while humans may have some inkling of general ethical\nprinciples and what is morally good and bad, these judgments are\nalways shaky given the frailty of our cognitive capacities.\nConsequently, religion is always needed to set our moral judgments on\nfirm ground (M\u0101tur\u012bd\u012b KT: 346\u201351).\n\nAsh\u02bfarite and Maturidite scholars also added further arguments to\nthe arsenal of criticisms against the Mu\u02bftazilite ethical theory.\nFor instance, in The Guide to Conclusive Proofs, Juwayn\u012b\nputs forth an account of the good and bad, which in certain ways\nanticipates the moral theory of David Hume seven hundred years later\n(Juwayn\u012b Proofs, 141\u20136). The Mu\u02bftazilite\nposition rests on two key elements: (1) that some actions are either\ninherently and rationally good or bad and (2) the implicit assumption\nthat a rational agent must act in a rational way. Juwayn\u012b simply\ndenies that moral actions are inherently rational and that\nconsequently there is anything irrational when one does a good or bad\naction. To be sure, actions can be obligatory and praiseworthy or\nprohibited and blameworthy, but not rational. Instead, continues\nJuwayn\u012b, when through self-reflection or inference one recognizes\nthat certain actions are seemingly beneficial and others harmful, one\nmerely instinctually recognizes that those actions produce pleasure or\npain. It is the human\u2019s (and all animals\u2019) natural\ninstinct to seek pleasure and to avoid pain that motivates the action,\nnot some inherent rational property of the object that reason\ngrasps.\n\nGhaz\u0101l\u012b likewise rejected the Mu\u02bftazilites\u2019\nposition, which he claimed rested upon an ambiguity in the meanings of\nthe terms \u2018good\u2019, \u2018bad\u2019 and\n\u2018obligatory\u2019 (w\u0101jib). For Ghaz\u0101l\u012b,\nwhen one says an action is \u2018good\u2019 or \u2018bad\u2019,\nthose value judgments must be understood in terms of the intention or\npurpose relative to the agent or the one affected by the action. So\nunderstood, an action is good if it achieves the intended purpose and\nbad if it does not. While reason can direct and set one\u2019s\nintentions, so can imagination and estimation (wahm) as well\nas our passions and appetites. These latter faculty, however,\nfrequently fail to get at what is ultimately beneficial and harmful\nfor us, and so they fail to get at what an agent would intend all\nthings considered. Divine law provides precisely the\n\u2018all-things-considered\u2019 view.\n\nAs for human reason\u2019s determining what is morally incumbent upon\nGod, Ghaz\u0101l\u012b continues that since good and bad are related\nto the intentions of the agent, it is impossible for reason alone to\ndetermine whether God\u2019s actions are good or bad since we simply\ndo not know God\u2019s intentions independent of revelation. Fakhr\nal-D\u012bn al-R\u0101z\u012b developed a similar defense (F. D.\nR\u0101z\u012b al-Ma\u1e6d\u0101lib, 289\u2013304; also see\nShihadeh 2006 and 2021). Now instead of understanding good and bad\nrelative to an agent\u2019s intentions, Razi explains them in\nconsequentialist terms: Actions are good when, relative to the agent\nor one affected by the action, they are beneficial or pleasurable and\nbad when they are harmful or painful. Since God is in no need of\nbenefit and in no way can be pained, there is a sense in which his\nactions are simply beyond good and evil.\n\nIn light of their denial that there is any objective, God-independent\nstandard of right and wrong to which God is beholden, Ash\u02bfarites\nwere accused of undermining God\u2019s justice and making the\ngoodness or badness of actions arbitrary. That is because if there\nwere no limits to what God can morally command, then what God willed\nin the past to be good or bad, he could in the future will and so\ncommand to be contrariwise. Indeed, God may inflict pain on an\ninnocent for no reason whatsoever, and yet that action would be good\nprecisely because God commanded it. The Ash\u02bfarites were not\ninsensitive to this complaint. While both al-Juwayn\u012b and\nGhaz\u0101l\u012b insist on God\u2019s absolute omnipotence and so\nGod\u2019s possibility to act arbitrarily, they also note that an\naction is only actually arbitrary if it is actually carried out, not\nif its occurrence is merely possible. Thus, a preferred Ash\u02bfarite\nresponse to the arbitrariness complaint was that the possibility of\nthe occurrence is not the occurrence of the possibility; God confirms\nvia revelation that he gives reward for good actions and he may punish\nonly those who do not fulfill what is decreed by revelation\n(Juwayn\u012b Proofs, 157\u201364, 209\u201311 and\nGhaz\u0101l\u012b Moderation, 172\u201388).\n",
