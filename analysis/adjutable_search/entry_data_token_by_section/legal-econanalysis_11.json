    "main_text": "The Normativity of Law || Interpreting Choice\n4.1 Interpreting Choice\n\nConsider Liza who has gone to a restaurant with friends. The menu\noffers two main courses: beef and tofu. Liza must choose one. Suppose\nLiza chooses tofu. How can we understand or rationalize her\nchoice?\n\nA rational choice explanation will refer to her preferences, her\nbeliefs, and the environment in which she chooses. Liza might choose\ntofu because she prefers tofu to meat. She might choose tofu because\nshe prefers healthy meals to unhealthy meals and she believes that\ntofu is healthier than meat. She might choose tofu because she is\nbudget-constrained and tofu is cheaper than meat. Or Liza might have\nmore complex preferences. Perhaps all of Liza\u2019s friends have\nchosen tofu and Liza has a taste for conformity.\n\nSuppose, however, that Liza believes that it is wrong to inflict pain\non sentient creatures. She believes she has a moral obligation not to\neat meat. She thus chooses tofu. How does the rational choice model\naccommodate this belief? It might accommodate this moral attitude by\nincorporating it into her preferences in one of two ways. Liza, that\nis, might internalize the norm in two distinct ways. Liza might\ndevelop a substantive preference for tofu over meat. She would\ninternalize the content of the norm. On this account, if her\nmoral view changed, Liza\u2019s preference for tofu over meat would\nremain. The moral norm, or Liza\u2019s endorsement of that norm,\nwould not have had any (direct) influence on her behavior. \n\nOr she might have a preference for norm compliance; that is, all other\nthings equal, she prefers actions that conform to the norm to actions\nthat violate it. One might say that Liza incurs a \u201ccost\u201d\nfrom non-compliance with a norm. Then, if she prefers meat to tofu,\nall else equal, she will choose tofu when the cost of norm violation\nis sufficiently high. If Liza\u2019s moral views changed, she would\nrevert to eating meat. The two forms of internalization thus yield\ndifferent behavioral predictions. This account of normativity,\nhowever, has an ad hoc quality to it as the cost of norm violation is\nnot directly observable. \n",
