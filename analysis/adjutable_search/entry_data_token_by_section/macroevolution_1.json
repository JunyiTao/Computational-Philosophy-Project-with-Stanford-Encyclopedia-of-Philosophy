    "main_text": "Species Selection\n2. Species Selection\n\nIf punctuated equilibria (PE) was the first innovative idea about\nmacroevolution to emerge during the 1970s, species selection followed\nclose on its heels. Just how the two ideas are related is itself a\ntopic of some philosophical interest (Turner 2010). According to\nEldredge and Gould (1972), driven or directional change is\nonly part of the theoretical story about the evolution of morphology;\nit is not, perhaps, even a geologically common narrative. Directional\nselection is selection that changes a population, pushing its\ndistribution of traits from one pattern of trait expression to\nanother. More typical, according the Eldredge and Gould, are cases of\neither non-directional change or even stasis. Like\ndirectional selection, nondirectional selection also changes a\npopulation, but not towards any particular distribution of\ntraits\u2014it just moves a population from one pattern to another.\nStabilizing selection is selection that keeps a population the same,\nnudging it back to its trait distribution pattern whenever it starts\nto stray away. PE as originally formulated favors stabilizing\nselection, suggesting that both individuals and species are inherently\nstable homeostatic systems\u2014systems that are \u201camazingly\nwell-buffered to resist change and maintain stability in the face of\ndisturbing influences\u201d (Eldredge & Gould 1972: 114). On this\nview, whatever the mechanisms that \u201cresist change and maintain\nstability\u201d are, they are in conflict with and must be overcome\nby directional natural selection in order for natural selection to\nsuccessfully push for or \u201cforce\u201d directional change.\nWhether natural selection is properly thought of as a force is itself\nan interesting philosophical issue (Sober 1984; Walsh 2000; Matthen\n& Ariew 2002; Walsh, Lewens, & Ariew 2002; Bouchard &\nRosenberg 2004; Stephens 2004; Brandon 2006; Millstein 2006; Filler\n2009). Setting that question aside, however, allows us to consider the\nsuggestion that species might be homeostatic systems which\n\u201cresist change by self-regulation\u201d (Eldredge & Gould\n1972: 114)\u2014as this is a suggestion rife with implications for\nmacroevolutionary theory.\n\nAt first, the idea that species are homeostatic systems may have been\na way of addressing critics of PE, who wondered what sort of\nbiological mechanisms could maintain stasis over long stretches of\ngeological time. However, it is a short step from thinking of species\nas homeostatic systems to thinking of them as the sort of thing that\ncould be a unit of selection. Eldredge and Gould thought that\nvariation introduced amongst organisms is typically isolated within\nthe population and constrained by stabilizing selection, unless\ngeographic separation creates the conditions for rapid evolutionary\nchange. During allopatric speciation events, the adaptive forces\nnegate the stabilizing ones effectively enough to disrupt the stasis\nof the species and cause the formation of a new lineage. Eventually\nthough, the stabilizing forces (re)assert themselves upon the emergent\nspecies and (re)establish stasis. Most biologists think of stabilizing\nselection as an ordinary microevolutionary process (Schmalhausen\n1949); however, the suggestion that a species is a homeostatic system\nmakes it look like some form of stabilizing selection might be\noperating (in some sense) as a mechanism that maintains equilibrium at\nthe level of populations.\n\nWhen modeling how these interactions generate macroevolutionary\npatterns, PE presents the dominant (i.e., equilibrium) state as one of\npopulation-level morphological stasis\u2014a state in which\nspeciation attempts often occur but generally fail to take. These\nperiods of stasis are occasionally interrupted (i.e., punctuated) by\nperiods of population-level morphological change\u2014periods of\nsuccessful speciation. This bifurcated model (depicting states of both\nstasis and change) is one in which species behave a little bit like\norganisms: speciation begins to look like reproduction, and extinction\nbegins to look like death. Crucial to this picture is the claim that\nonce a new species comes into existence, it mostly exhibits stasis.\nThe analogy is by no means perfect (Havstad 2016 in Other Internet\nResources), but it did open up a new field of theoretical exploration.\nWhat if the differential speciation and extinction of whole lineages\nis a lot like the differential survival and reproduction of\nindividuals in a population? PE may not logically imply species\nselection, but it does point in that direction by suggesting that\nspecies resemble organisms in relevant ways\u2014for instance, by\nhaving comparable integration and cohesion, enough for populations to\nblock directional change in favor of stasis.\n\nInitially, Eldredge and Gould (1972) were quite explicit that they did\nnot see their model as entailing a new type of selection. They\nstraightforwardly wrote \u201cwe postulate no \u2018new\u2019 type\nof selection\u201d (Eldredge & Gould 1972: 112). But in 1975, the\npaleontologist and evolutionary theorist Steven M. Stanley dubbed\nEldredge and Gould\u2019s population-level selection process a form\nof species selection, and by 1977 the inventors of PE concurred. They\nwrote that they nonetheless understood species selection as\nrepresenting \u201cno more than the operation of natural selection at\nhigher levels\u201d (Gould & Eldredge 1977: 139), but still, this\ninterpretation presents a challenge to one typical way of\ninstantiating the dominant model of natural selection.\n\nRegarding the dominant model: classically and summarily described (see\nGodfrey-Smith 2007), evolution occurs when individuals in a population\naccumulate a change to the degree that this change becomes a feature\nin the population. On this view, natural selection requires variation,\nfitness, and heritability (Lewontin 1970; though see Brandon 1990).\nWhen all three of these things coincide within populations, and change\nresultantly accumulates, evolution occurs. Proponents of species\nselection argue that these three conditions are met at the species\nlevel.\n\nBut on a typical way of instantiating this rather abstract model of\nnatural selection, one can identify what plays the role of the\nindividuals in this model (organisms) and what plays the role of the\npopulations (species). This popular view treats organisms as the units\nof selection and species as the units of evolution. Species evolve,\nowing to the differential survival and reproduction of organisms. This\nemphasis on organism-level selection and species-level evolution is\nanother which dates back to Darwin\u2019s Origin of Species,\nalthough Darwin also countenanced family selection (Darwin 1859),\nsexual selection (Darwin 1871) and group selection (Stauffer 1975).\nSome early proponents of the modern synthesis (e.g., Mayr 1942, 2001)\nalso shared this basic picture in which selection acts on organisms,\nwhile species evolve. To propose that selection occurs at the level of\nspecies as opposed to that of organisms, is to suppose that not only\ncan organisms act as the units of selection but that species can\ntoo.\n\nSo, if the proper way to understand natural selection casts organisms\nas the units of selection, and species as the unit of evolution, then\nGould and Eldredge\u2019s model of PE challenges that view.\nAlternatively, if the proper way to understand natural selection\nmerely names biological individuals as the units of selection and\nbiological populations as the unit of evolution, and species can be\nbiological individuals too, then Gould and Eldredge\u2019s model of\nPE is not really a challenge to the model of natural selection, it is\njust a new instance of it. This is because the notion of\n biological individual (see entry)\n is more expansive than that of biological organism; biological\nindividuals include but are not limited to biological organisms.\nBiofilms, coral reefs, insect colonies, obligate symbionts,\nsiphonophores, slime molds, and viruses are just a few of the many\nbiological entities that we might want to consider as individuals,\nalthough they are not organisms (see Buss 1983; J. Wilson 1999; Clarke\n2010, 2013; and R.A. Wilson & Barker 2013, among others). If\nspecies are themselves individuals (Ghiselin 1974; Hull 1976), then\nthe traditional evolutionary theorist may be able to accommodate\nspecies-level selection\u2014in this sense, it is just another flavor\nof individual-level selection. Note that is it is very easy for this\ndispute to become an instance of what the philosopher John Beatty\n(1997) calls a \u201crelative significance\u201d debate\u2014one in\nwhich proponents move from arguing about whether something is possible\n(species acting as the unit of selection) to whether that thing is\nsignificant (as opposed to a mere oddity).\n\nMany of these issues\u2014such as how to understand stabilizing\nmechanisms and selection, what biological individuals are, whether\nspecies are individuals, and whether species-level selection is\nreducible to individual-level selection\u2014are ongoing. In the\ndecades since Eldredge and Gould first outlined the theory of\npunctuated equilibria, various biological theorists have attempted to\nprovide definitive and irreducible examples of species-level\nselection\u2014ones that cannot be recreated at lower levels such as\nthat of the organism. Species-level traits like range size (where a\nspecies may be wide-ranging even though its organisms are not; see\nJablonski 1987) and rate of speciation (where a species may be slow to\n\u201creproduce\u201d although its organisms are not; see Vrba 1987)\nare especially promising candidates. In addition to the issue of\nproviding definitive examples of irreducible species selection, there\nis also the issue of providing a satisfactory definition of the\nconcept itself. The biologist Elisabeth Vrba (1984) posits that all\nproposed definitions of species selection ought to identify causes, be\nrestricted enough for testing, and employ a concept of selection that\nis consistent with how selection is understood to act at other levels\nas well. See Vrba (1984), Cracraft (1985), Grantham (1995), Jablonski\n(2008), and Turner (2011b: chapters 4 and 5) for further discussion of\nspecies selection.\n",
