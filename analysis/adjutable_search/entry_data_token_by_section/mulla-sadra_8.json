It is separate from (but attached to) the body and is the true\nbearer of identity (Mulla Sadra 2004: 467). As we saw above in the\ndoctrine of substantial motion, the soul is on the path of perfection\ntowards simplicity and unity and its reversion to its origins in the\nOne. In itself the soul is eternal and incorruptible and does not die\nwith the body but reverts to its origins with the One (Mulla Sadra\n2004: 515). Where does the soul come from? Given the Neoplatonic\ninfluence on Mulla Sadra, one would expect him to insist upon the\npre-existence of the soul and various texts are adduced in favour of\nsuch a position. However, he makes a distinction between the species\n\u2018soul\u2019 which he calls the \u2018Adamic soul\u2019 and\nthe individual human soul. The basic problem with allowing for the\npre-existence of the individual soul is that it potentially opens the\nway for a belief in metempsychosis which he rejects, as we shall see.\nIn the Wisdom of the Throne, he argues for the pre-existence\nof the human soul as a category:\n\nThe Adamic soul has an existence preceding the body without this\nentailing metempsychosis or necessitating the pre-eternity of the\nindividual soul, which is the well-known doctrine of Plato. This mode\nof pre-existence does not require the multiplicity of individuals of a\nsingle species or their differentiation without reference to matter or\nany disposition towards matter. Nor does it entail the soul\u2019s\nbeing divided after it had been one in the manner of continuous\nessences. Nor does it suppose the soul\u2019s inactivity before being\nunited with bodies (Mulla Sadra 1981, 140\u20131).\n\n\nThe individual soul is the bearer of its body, its vehicle (Mulla\nSadra 2001\u20135, IX: 63\u20134). It comes into existence with the\nbody and still retains the sense of being the entelechy of the body\nwhich is why the two cannot be detached (Mulla Sadra 2004: 240). Just\nas existence is not an accident of essence but is the principle to\nwhich an essence is attached, similarly the soul is not an accident of\nthe body (Mulla Sadra 1981: 139). He cannot admit the pre-existence of\nparticular human souls because that might open the way towards\nmetempsychosis which is a doctrine that he vehemently rejects in his\neschatology.\n",
