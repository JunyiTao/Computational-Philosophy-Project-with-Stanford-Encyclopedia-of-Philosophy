    "main_text": "The Nature of Grounding || Strict ordering\n2.3 Strict ordering\n\nSome claim that grounding is a strict order\u2014it\u2019s\ntransitive, irreflexive, and asymmetric (Correia 2010; Fine 2012a;\nRaven 2013). One way to argue that grounding has some or all of these\nfeatures is to embrace separatism (grounding is\ndeterminationG) and argue that\ndeterminationG or determination in general has\nsome or all of them (Audi 2012a). Another option is to embrace\nunionism (grounding is explanationG), focusing on\nthe features of explanationG or explanation in\ngeneral (Raven 2015). Another way, still, is to argue that, given\neither separatism or unionism, grounding plays the theoretical roles\nnormally assigned to it only if it has some or all of these features\n(Kovacs 2018). These strategies can be used to argue that grounding\nhas further properties as well. For example, Litland (2013) and Raven\n(2015) claim that explanation in general is non-monotonic, so, given\nunionism, grounding is as well; and Audi (2012a) claims that\ndetermination in general is non-monotonic, so, given separatism,\ngrounding is as well.\n\nWhile the view that grounding is a strict-order is the prevailing\nview, what reasons might there be to think otherwise? (As Bliss &\nPriest [2018b] note, there are various possible combinations of formal\nproperties that we may wish to ultimately consider.) Let\u2019s begin\nwith transitivity. Consider the following case, adapted from one that\nSchaffer (2012) proposes. Suppose that the following claims are true,\nwhere g is a metal globe:\n\n(1)\n[g is dented in thus-and-so way] grounds [g has\ndeterminate shape S].\n(2)\n[g has determinate shape S] grounds [g\nis more-or-less spherical].\n\n\nIf grounding is transitive, then the following is true as well:\n\n(3)\n[g is dented in thus-and-so way] grounds [g is\nmore-or-less spherical].\n\n\nYou might think, however, that\n (3)\n is false\u2014as Schaffer puts the idea, \u201cThe thing is\nmore-or-less spherical despite the minor dent, not because of\nit\u201d (2012: 127). Note that\n (1)\n concerns merely partial grounding, while\n (2)\n concerns full grounding. But, as any merely partial ground is a\npartial ground, and any full ground is a partial ground, we can read\n(1)\u2013(3) as targeting partial grounding, so there is no\nequivocation here.\n\nHow might proponents of transitivity respond? Litland (2013) proposes\nthat we can add a fact to the merely partial ground for [g\nhas determinate shape S] to get a full ground:\n\n(4)\n[g is dented in thus-and-so way], [g elsewhere\nhas determinate shape \\(S'\\)] fully grounds [g has\ndeterminate shape S].\n\n\nGiven that\n (2)\n also concerns full grounding, the transitive inference from\n (4)\n and\n (2)\n is the following:\n\n(5)\n[g is dented in thus-and-so way], [g elsewhere\nhas determinate shape \\(S'\\)] fully grounds [g is\nmore-or-less spherical].\n\n\nLitland claims that\n (5)\n is plausible, or at least as plausible as\n (1)\n and\n (2).\n And, provided that any collection of facts that is a full ground is\nsuch that any fact among that collection is a partial ground,\n (3)\n follows from\n (5).\n (See Raven 2015 for a similar treatment of this case; see also\nRodriguez-Pereyra 2015 and Tahko 2013 for potential counterexamples to\ntransitivity involving truth.)\n\nTurning to irreflexivity, Bliss (2018) critically assesses the general\ntheoretical motivations for thinking that grounding is irreflexive.\nLowe (1998: 145) suggests that self-explanatory states of affairs are\nepistemically possible, so perhaps a characterization of grounding\nshouldn\u2019t rule this out. Historically, certain influential\nthinkers have thought that the fact that God exists, for example, is a\nself-explanatory state of affairs. Fine (2010) and Kr\u00e4mer (2013)\nalso discuss various cases that seem to involve violations of\nirreflexivity. Here is a case along the lines of those they\ndiscuss\u2014consider the following fact: [Some fact or other\nobtains]. Some facts do indeed obtain, so of course [Some fact or\nother obtains] itself obtains. And it seems that any fact that obtains\nis something that grounds this fact. Since [Some fact or other\nobtains] is itself a fact that obtains, it follows that this fact\ngrounds itself!\n\nIn response to cases like this, Woods (2018) distinguishes between\nwhat he calls vacuous and non-vacuous grounding.\nWoods suggests that cases like [Some fact or other obtains] involve\nvacuous grounding, and, while vacuous grounding isn\u2019t\nirreflexive, non-vacuous grounding is. Roughly speaking, \\([P],\\)\n\\([P'],\\) \u2026 vacuously grounds \\([Q]\\) when the former grounds\nthe latter, yet the identity and nature of the constituents of\n\\([P],\\) \\([P'],\\) \u2026 aren\u2019t explanatorily relevant to\n\\([Q]\\) obtaining. Perhaps [The truck is red] is a vacuous ground for\n[Some fact or other obtains]\u2014while the former grounds the\nlatter, it seems that the identity and nature of the truck and the\nproperty of being red don\u2019t contribute to explaining why [Some\nfact or other] obtains.\n\nTurning to asymmetry, Bliss (2014) and Thompson (2016, 2018)\ncritically assess the general theoretical motivations for thinking\nthat grounding is asymmetric and propose potential counterexamples.\nThompson suggests that, given the functional relationship between\nmass, volume, and density (the density of a substance is its mass\ndivided its volume), we should accept that, say, [g has\n3cm3 volume] grounds [g has 2g/cm3\ndensity] and vice versa. It\u2019s worth noting, however, that many\nreciprocal functional relationships don\u2019t involve symmetric\ngrounding. As Alexander Skiles has suggested to us in conversation,\nthere is, for example, a reciprocal functional relationship between\nhow many things are Socrates and how many members Socrates\u2019\nsingleton has, but it\u2019s clear in which direction the grounding\nruns in this case.\n",
