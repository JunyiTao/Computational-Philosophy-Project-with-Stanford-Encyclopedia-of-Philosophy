    "main_text": "Arguments for Narrow Content || Argument from Phenomenal Intentionality\n3.4 Argument from Phenomenal Intentionality\n\nA more recent argument for the existence of narrow content is an\nargument from phenomenal intentionality (Loar 2003; Horgan and Tienson\n2002; Horgan, Tienson and Graham 2004; Kriegel 2013). To understand\nthis argument, we first need to understand what its proponents mean by\n\u201cphenomenal intentionality.\u201d (For a detailed overview of\nthe topic of phenomenal intentionality, including connections with\nnarrow content, see the entry on\n phenomenal intentionality.)\n Philosophers of mind have traditionally drawn a sharp distinction\nbetween two sorts of properties of mental states, phenomenal\nproperties and intentional properties. Phenomenal properties have to\ndo with the felt character of conscious experience, with \u201cwhat\nit\u2019s like,\u201d in Thomas Nagel\u2019s famous phrase (Nagel\n1974). Intentional properties have to do with the representational\ncharacter of mental states, i.e. with their content. One view of the\nrelation between phenomenal and intentional properties, called\n\u201cseparatism\u201d by Horgan and Tienson (2002), is that they\nare independent of one another: any given phenomenal character could\nbe accompanied by any intentional properties (or none), and vice\nversa. According to Lycan (2008 \u00a79), this view was \u201cthe\nstandard attitude among philosophers of mind between the 1950s and the\n1980s.\u201d On another view of the relation between the intentional\nand the phenomenal, known as representationalism, the phenomenal\ncharacter of experience is completely determined by its intentional\nnature. The key thesis of phenomenal intentionality is that, while\nrepresentationalism is correct that there is an intimate connection\nbetween phenomenology and intentionality, the determination runs in\nthe opposite direction: there is a kind of intentional content,\nphenomenal intentionality, which is entirely constitutively determined\nby the phenomenal character of a mental state. \n\nThis thesis is one premise of the argument from phenomenal\nintentionality to narrow content. The other premise is that the\nphenomenal character of experience is itself narrow. Putting the two\npremises together, we get the following argument for the existence of\nnarrow content: \u201c(1) There is pervasive intentional content that\nconstitutively depends on phenomenology alone. (2) Phenomenology\nconstitutively depends only on narrow factors. So, (3) There is\npervasive intentional content that constitutively depends only on\nnarrow factors\u201d (Horgan and Tienson 2002, p. 527; cf. Horgan,\nTienson and Graham 2004, p. 300).\n\nBoth premises of this argument are controversial. The second premise,\nthat phenomenology is narrow, is rejected by phenomenal externalists\n(Lycan 2008, \u00a714), while the controversial character of the first\npremise, that there is intentional content that is entirely determined\nby phenomenology, can be seen in the fact that its proponents have\nadvanced it as a departure from orthodoxy. Defenders of phenomenal\nintentionality have supported both premises by appeal to brain-in-vat\nscenarios. Suppose that alien beings synthesize a structure identical\nto your own brain, and connect it to a computer-controlled apparatus\nthat provides inputs to this brain-like object which maintain its\nsimilarity to your brain over a substantial period of time. (See\nHorgan, Tienson and Graham 2004 for further details. This fairly\nelaborate brain-in-vat scenario avoids some of Burge\u2019s\nobjections (Burge 2003, pp. 443\u2013445) to Loar\u2019s\nless-fully-described version (Loar 2003).) Defenders of phenomenal\nintentionality find it intuitively plausible that by virtue of its\nphysical similarity with your brain, the brain-like object will also\nshare your phenomenology, supporting the narrowness of phenomenology;\nand that the brain-like object will, by virtue of sharing your\nphenomenology, also share many of the contents of your mental states,\nsupporting the existence of phenomenally-determined intentionality.\n(For these two uses of the brain-in-vat scenario, see Horgan, Tienson\nand Graham 2004, p. 302. For additional arguments for the existence of\nphenomenal intentionality, see Kriegel 2013, \u00a72.1. Criticisms of\nphenomenal intentionality may be found in Bailey and Richards 2014 and\nWerner 2015.)\n\nThe most immediately plausible purported example of phenomenal\nintentionality is the content of perceptual experience. If perceptual\nexperience is a genuine example of phenomenally determined\nintentionality, but also the only example, then the argument from\nphenomenal intentionality would show the existence of narrow contents\nof perceptual states, but would be silent on whether other mental\nstates such as beliefs and desires have narrow contents. However, some\ndefenders of phenomenal intentionality (e.g. Horgan, Tienson and\nGraham 2004 and several of the contributors to Bayne and Montague\n2011) would go further, arguing that there are distinctive\nphenomenologies of agency and of propositional attitudes including\nbeliefs and desires; that the phenomenal properties of these mental\nstates also constitutively determine intentional properties; and\nmoreover that all intentionality either is identical with, or\nis derived from, phenomenal intentionality. If these bolder theses are\ncorrect, then the argument from phenomenal intentionality would give\nreason to think that all of the propositional attitudes have narrow\ncontents, and that their wide contents, if any, are derived from these\nnarrow contents.\n",
