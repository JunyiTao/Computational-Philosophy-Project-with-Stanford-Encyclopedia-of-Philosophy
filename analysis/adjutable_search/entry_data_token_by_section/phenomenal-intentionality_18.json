You feel a sudden panic;\nyou think perhaps you have locked yourself out; you try to remember\nwhere you put the keys, then recall switching them to your coat pocket\nearlier; you reach and find them there\u2014relief. (Siewert 1998:\n277) \n\n\n\nI meet a friend, and she asks me, \u201cDid you bring the\nbook?\u201d For a moment I am at a loss as to what book she\u2019s\ntalking about\u2014and then I realize in an instant what book it is.\n(Siewert 2011: 258) \n\n\nSiewert claims that such realizations needn\u2019t involve any verbal\nor perceptual imagery. In the case of the first example, you\ndon\u2019t think the words \u201cI have locked myself out\u201d or\nvisualize your keys. Siewert takes these and other similar examples to\nshow that thought has a proprietary phenomenology. \n\nSimilarly, in order to argue that the phenomenal properties of thought\nare not merely associated with verbal imagery, Horgan and Tienson\n(2002) point to examples of spontaneous thoughts we have when engaging\nin activities such as cooking or working in a garage or woodshop:\n\n\nThere is something that it is like to think that a certain tool is\njust there\u2014in that cabinet, say\u2014but such beliefs are\ntypically not verbalized either vocally or subvocally or by way of\nverbal imagery. (Horgan and Tienson 2002: 523) \n\n\nLike Siewert\u2019s examples, this example helps motivate the claim\nthat thought has a proprietary phenomenology. \n\nThis line of argument relies heavily on introspection. Unfortunately, detractors of\ncognitive phenomenology (for example, Robinson 2011 and Tye &\nWright 2011) claim that their own observations of sudden realization\nreveal less phenomenology, resulting in an apparent stalemate. \n",
