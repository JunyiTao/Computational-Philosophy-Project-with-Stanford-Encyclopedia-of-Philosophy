    "main_text": "\n\n\nDescartes\u2019 ontological (or a priori) argument is both one of\nthe most fascinating and poorly understood aspects of his\nphilosophy. Fascination with the argument stems from the effort to\nprove God\u2019s existence from simple but powerful premises. Existence is\nderived immediately from the clear and distinct idea of a supremely\nperfect being. Ironically, the simplicity of the argument has also\nproduced several misreadings, exacerbated in part by Descartes\u2019\ntendency to formulate it in different ways.\n\n\nThe main statement of the argument appears in the Fifth Meditation.\nThis comes on the heels of an earlier causal argument for God\u2019s\nexistence in the Third Meditation, raising questions about the order\nand relation between these two distinct proofs. Descartes repeats the\nontological argument in a few other central texts including the\nPrinciples of Philosophy. He also defends it in the First,\nSecond, and Fifth Replies against scathing objections by some of the\nleading intellectuals of his day.\n\n\nDescartes was not the first philosopher to formulate an ontological\nargument. An earlier version of the argument had been vigorously\ndefended by St. Anselm in the eleventh century, and then criticized by\na monk named Gaunilo (Anselm\u2019s contemporary) and later by St. Thomas\nAquinas. Aquinas\u2019 critique was regarded as so devastating that\nthe ontological argument died out for several centuries. It thus came\nas a surprise to Descartes\u2019 contemporaries that he should attempt to\nresurrect it. Although he claims not to be familiar with Anselm\u2019s\nversion of the proof, Descartes appears to craft his own argument so as\nto block traditional objections.\n\n\nDespite similarities, Descartes\u2019 version of the argument differs\nfrom Anselm\u2019s in important ways. The latter\u2019s version is\nthought to proceed from the meaning of the word \u201cGod,\u201d by\ndefinition, God is a being a greater than which cannot be\nconceived. Descartes\u2019 argument, in contrast, is grounded in two\ncentral tenets of his philosophy \u2014 the theory of innate ideas\nand the doctrine of clear and distinct perception. He purports to rely\nnot on an arbitrary definition of God but rather on an innate idea\nwhose content is \u201cgiven.\u201d Descartes\u2019 version is also\nextremely simple. God\u2019s existence is inferred directly from the\nfact that necessary existence is contained in the clear and distinct\nidea of a supremely perfect being. Indeed, on some occasions he\nsuggests that the so-called ontological \u201cargument\u201d is not\na formal proof at all but a self-evident axiom grasped intuitively by\na mind free of philosophical prejudice.\n\n\nDescartes often compares the ontological argument to a geometric\ndemonstration, arguing that necessary existence cannot be excluded\nfrom idea of God anymore than the fact that its angles equal two right\nangles, for example, can be excluded from the idea of a triangle. The\nanalogy underscores once again the argument\u2019s supreme\nsimplicity. God\u2019s existence is purported to be as obvious and\nself-evident as the most basic mathematical truth. It also attempts to\nshow how the \u201clogic\u201d of the demonstration is rooted in our\nordinary reasoning practices.\n\n\nIn the same context, Descartes also characterizes the ontological\nargument as a proof from the \u201cessence\u201d or\n\u201cnature\u201d of God, arguing that necessary existence cannot\nbe separated from the essence of a supremely perfect being without\ncontradiction. In casting the argument in these terms, he is\nimplicitly relying on a traditional medieval distinction between a\nthing\u2019s essence and its existence. According to this tradition, one\ncan determine what something is (i.e. its essence), independently of\nknowing whether it exists. This distinction appears useful to\nDescartes\u2019 aims, some have thought, because it allows him to specify\nGod\u2019s essence without begging the question of his existence.\n",
