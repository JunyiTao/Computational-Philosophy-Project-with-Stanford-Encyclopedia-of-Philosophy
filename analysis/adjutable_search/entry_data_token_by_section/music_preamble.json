    "main_text": "\n\nPhilosophy of music is the study of fundamental questions about the\nnature and value of music and our experience of it. Like any\n\u201cphilosophy of X,\u201d it presupposes knowledge of its target.\nHowever, unlike philosophy of science, say, the target of philosophy\nof music is a practice most people have a significant background in,\nmerely as a result of being members of a musical culture. Many people\ntake music to play a significant and valuable role in their lives.\nThus, as with the central questions of metaphysics, epistemology, and\nethics, not only can most people quickly grasp the philosophical\nquestions music raises, they tend to have thought about some of those\nquestions before encountering the academic discipline itself.\n\nMusic arguably presents more philosophical puzzles than any other art.\nUnlike painting, its works often have multiple instances, none of\nwhich can be identified with the work itself. Thus, the question of\nwhat exactly the work is is initially more puzzling than the\nsame question about works of painting, which appear (at least\ninitially) to be ordinary physical objects. Unlike much literature,\nthe instances of a work are performances, which offer interpretations\nof the work, yet the work can also be interpreted (perhaps in a\ndifferent sense) independent of any performance, and performances\nthemselves can be interpreted. This talk of\n\u201cinterpretation\u201d points to the fact that we find music an\nart steeped with meaning, and yet, unlike drama, music\u2014at least\n\u201cpure\u201d instrumental music\u2014has no obvious semantic\ncontent. This quickly raises the question of why we should find music\nso valuable. Central to many philosophers\u2019 thinking on these\nsubjects has been music\u2019s apparent ability to express emotions\nwhile remaining an abstract art in some sense.\n\nThis entry focuses almost exclusively on contemporary philosophy of\nmusic (i.e., work since the mid-twentieth century) in an analytic\nvein. For a historical overview, see the entries on the\n history of Western philosophy of music: antiquity to 1800\n and\n history of Western philosophy of music: since 1800.\n For much broader introductions to philosophy of music, covering its\nhistory, major figures, connections with other disciplines, and a\nwider range of topics, see Gracyk & Kania 2011 and McAuley,\nNielsen, & Levinson 2021. Useful single-author overviews include\nScruton 1997, Kivy 2002, Hamilton 2007, and Kania 2020.\n\nMost analytic work has primarily discussed Western classical music.\n(For criticism of this tendency, see Alperson 2009.) In the last 25\nyears, there has been increasing recognition that different musical\npractices may not only suggest different answers to the same\nphilosophical questions, but also raise different philosophical\nquestions. Apart from Western classical music, popular Western\ntraditions, such as rock and jazz, have received the most attention.\nNon-Western musical traditions have received little attention.\n(Exceptions include S. Davies 2001: 254\u201394 and 2007; Alperson,\nNguyen, & To 2007; S. P. Walton 2007; and Higgins 2007.)\n",
