    "main_text": "Types and Universals\n3. Types and Universals\n\n\nAre types universals? They have usually been so conceived, and with\ngood reason. But the matter is controversial. It depends in part on\nwhat a universal is. (See the entry on\n properties.)\n Universals, in contrast to particulars, have been characterized as\nhaving instances, being repeatable, being abstract, being acausal,\nlacking a spatio-temporal location and being predicable of\nthings. Whether universals have all these characteristics cannot\nbe resolved here. The point is that types seem to have some, but not\nall, of these characteristics. As should be clear from the preceding\ndiscussion, types have or are capable of having instances, of being\nexemplified; they are repeatable. To many, this is enough to count as\nuniversals. With respect to being abstract and lacking a\nspatio-temporal location, types are also akin to universals\u2014that\nis, they are if universals are. On certain views of types and\nuniversals, types, unlike their instances, are abstract and lack a\nspatio-temporal location. On other views, types and universals are\nin their instances and hence are neither abstract nor\nacausal; far from lacking a spatio-temporal location, they usually\nhave many. (For more details, see \u00a75 below, The Relation\nbetween Types and Tokens.) So far, then, types appear to be a\nspecies of universal, and most metaphysicians would so classify\nthem. (Although a few would not. Zemach (1992), for example, holds\nthat there are no universals, but there are types, which are\nrepeatable particulars\u2014the cat may be in many different\nplaces at the same time.)\n\n\nWhen it comes to being predicable, however, most types\ndiverge from such classic examples of universals as the property of\nbeing white or the relation of being east of. They\nseem not to be predicable, or at least not as obviously so as the\nclassic examples of universals. That is, if the hallmark of a\nuniversal is to answer to a predicate or open sentence such as\nbeing white answers to \u2018is white\u2019, then most\ntypes do not resemble universals, as they more readily answer to\nsingular terms.  This is amply illustrated by the type talk exhibited\nin \u00a72 above. It is also underscored by the observation that it is\nmore natural to say of a token of a word\u2014\u2018infinity\u2019,\nsay\u2014that it is a token of the word \u2018infinity\u2019 than\nthat it is an \u2018infinity\u2019.  That is to say, types seem to\nbe objects, like numbers and sets, rather than properties or\nrelations; it's just that they are not concrete particulars but\nare general objects\u2014abstract objects, on some views. If, then,\nwe follow Gottlob Frege (1977) in classifying all objects as being the\nsort of thing referred to by singular terms, and all properties as the\nsort of thing referred to by predicates, then types would be\nobjects. Hence they would not fall into the same category as the\nclassic examples of universals such as being white and\nbeing east of, and thus perhaps should not be considered\nuniversals at all. (Although perhaps all this shows is that they are\nnot akin to properties, but are their own kind of universal.)  A\ngeneral exception to what has just been claimed about how we refer to\ntypes (with singular terms) might be inferred from the fact that we do\nmore often say of an animal that it is a tiger, rather than that it is\na member of the species Felis Tigris. This raises the\nquestion as to whether the species Felis Tigris is just the\nproperty of being a tiger, and if it isn't, then what\nthe relation between these two items is.\n\n\nWollheim (1968, p. 76) insightfully puts the point that types seem\nto be objects as that the relationship between a type and its tokens is\n\u201cmore intimate\u201d than that between (a classic example of) a\nproperty and its instances because \u201cfor much of the time we think\nand talk of the type as though it were itself a kind of token, though a\npeculiarly important or pre-eminent one\u201d. He (1968, p. 77)\nmentions two other differences worth noting between types and the\nclassic examples of universals. One is that although types and the\nclassic examples of properties often satisfy the same predicates, there\nare many more predicates shared between a type and its tokens than\nbetween a classic example of a property and its instances.\n(Beethoven's Symphony No. 9 is in the same key, has the\nsame number of measures, same number of notes, etc. as a great many of\nits tokens.) Second, he argues that predicates true of tokens in virtue\nof being tokens of the type are therefore true of the type (Old\nGlory is rectangular) but this is never the case with classic\nproperties (being white is not white.)\n\n\nThese considerations may not suffice to show that types aren't\nuniversals, but they do point to a difference between types and the\nclassic examples of properties.\n",
