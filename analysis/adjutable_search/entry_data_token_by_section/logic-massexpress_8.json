    "main_text": "Logical relations\n7. Logical relations\n\n\nIn what precedes, we have looked at the semantics of various kinds\nof sentences where mass nouns appear. But we haven\u2019t considered whether\nthere are logical relations between such sentences, i.e., whether the\nsemantics makes up for an adequate logic of mass nouns. This is the\ntopic of this section. An appropriate semantics for mass nouns should\nguarantee things like what follows. (For a more detailed discussion,\nsee Pelletier & Schubert 2003: 63\u201374.)\n\n\nExistential generalization: there are many sentences whose truth\nentails the truth of an existential generalization. For instance:\n\nThe wine is on the table. So some wine is on the table.\n\nUniversal instantiation: as mentioned in section 2, this kind of\nreasoning also seems to be valid:\n\nThis is gold. All gold is metal. Therefore, this is\nmetal.\n\nAlso, sentences like the following should come out as always true,\ngiven the meanings of the words involved: All gold is gold.\nAnd in any situation in which there is some gold in Zurich, this should\nalso be true: The gold in Zurich is gold.\n\n\nMass nouns can also be used in generic sentences, which express\ngeneralizations: Gold is metal. So one would need a semantics\nfor generic sentences to check, for instance, if this reasoning is\nvalidated: This is gold. Gold is metal. Therefore, this is\nmetal. However, the semantics of genericity is a vast topic, which\nfalls out of the scope of this entry (see also note 7).\n\n\nFinally, mass nouns can also be used as count nouns: Gold is a\nmetal. So a full-blown semantics, covering both mass nouns and\ncount nouns, should be able to validate syllogisms like the following,\nwhich involve mass and count uses of a mass noun: This is gold.\nGold is a metal. Therefore, this is a metal.\n\n\nFor illustration, let us see how the mixed set-theoretic and\nmereological framework developed in sections 4 and 6 handles some of\nthese cases. According to section 4:\n\nThe wine is on the table is true iff [the wine]\n\u2286 [on the table],\n\nwhere [the wine] denotes the\nsum of the wine, and [on the table] denotes the set containing\neverything that is on the table.\n\nSome wine is on the table is true iff [wine]\n\u2229 [on the table] \u2260 \u2205,\n\nwhere [wine] is the set containing everything that is wine (a\njoin semi-lattice).\n\n\nSince [wine] is the join semi-lattice\ncontaining everything that is wine, it contains in particular the sum\nof the wine. So, given how the semantics is set-up, the truth\nof The wine is one the table guarantees that of Some wine\nis on the table.\n\n\nFor a different case, according to sections 4 and 6:\n\nThis is gold is true iff [this] \u2286\n[gold]\nAll gold is metal is true iff [gold] \u2229\n[metal] = [gold]\n\nSo the truth of This is gold and All gold is metal\nguarantees that [this] \u2286 [metal] and so that\nThis is metal is true.\n",
