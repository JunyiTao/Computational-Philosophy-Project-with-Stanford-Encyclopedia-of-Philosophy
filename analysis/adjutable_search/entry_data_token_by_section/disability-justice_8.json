    "main_text": "Justice, Disability Identities, and Epistemic Injustice\n5. Justice, Disability Identities, and Epistemic Injustice\n\nThere are many categories or groups into which people can place\nthemselves, and be placed, on the basis of their varying\ncharacteristics. The salience and appeal of these categories depend on\nsocial and historical context as well as individual preferences and\nvalues. Identity and identity politics become important as members of\nhistorically excluded groups challenge their status and work for\ninclusion. Many women gained a sense of group identity in opposing\nlaws that limited voting and other political rights to men; racial\nidentities have been forged in the fight against segregation. Although\npeople with disabilities are not always understood as sharing an\nidentity, their awareness of membership in an oppressed group has been\nshaped by exclusionary laws and customs, from \u201cugly laws\u201d\nprohibiting people with physical deformities from appearing in public\nto the state-sponsored involuntary sterilization of \u201cmental\ndefectives\u201d. A sense of group identity has been further\nencouraged by welfare, social security and other laws that place\npeople with various disabilities in a single category, even if they\ndefine that category in different ways.\n\nThe importance of disability as a social category was increased by the\nmovement to establish civil rights for people with disabilities. As in\nthe case of other stigmatized groups, the characteristics used as a\nground for exclusion became a basis for mobilization and a source of\npride. The social model of disability, which informed the movement for\ndisability rights, emphasized what people with various impairments\nhave in common\u2014their stigmatization and exclusion\u2014and\nthereby promoted the emergence of disability as a powerful social\nidentity.\n\nCritics like Fraser argue that the importance of social identity\ncannot be adequately captured in any metric of individual advantage.\nAn effective social response to stigmatized identities requires both\nrecognition and transformation\u2014changes in cultural framing and\nsocial perception that are poorly served by redistribution. An\nemphasis on redistribution is often self-defeating, exacerbating\nstigma and reinforcing the impression of the stigmatized group as\ndeficient (Fraser 1995, 1997; see Olsen 2001). Yet as we will discuss, some\nways of transforming social identity have significant dangers as\nwell.\n\nFor proponents of recognition, one issue is whether justice requires\nnot only respect for individual members of society, but also respect\nfor their group or cultural identities. Must a just society recognize\n\u201cgroup-specific cultural identity\u201d or merely \u201cthe\nstatus of group members as full partners in social interaction\u201d\n(Fraser 2001: 23, 24)? Are these separate requirements, or does\nrespect for an individual entail respect for her social or cultural\nidentities? These questions have been addressed primarily with respect\nto religious, ethnic, racial, and sexual minorities. Very little work\nhas been done on the question of what a disability identity would look\nlike and what sorts of recognition claims it would implicate.\n\nA somewhat parallel issue has been raised in distributive\njustice\u2014must society allocate resources, broadly construed, to\nsupport the group and cultural identities of its members? That support\ncould be based on the claim that such identities are a constituent,\nperhaps an irreducible one, of the well-being of the individual\nmembers of society. This claim has been suggested by justice theorists\nwho argue for the importance of culture as a \u201ccontext of\nchoice\u201d for individuals (e.g., Kymlicka 1989, Sparrow 2005). An\nindividual deprived of a culture through which he has experienced and\ninterpreted the world will find it far more difficult to flourish. As\nwe will discuss, however, it is doubtful that disability in general,\nor particular impairments, play such a comprehensive role in the lives\nof many\u2014let alone all\u2014people with\n disabilities.[8]\n\nWe begin by describing the different characteristics of an\nindividual\u2019s \u201cidentity\u201d. One sense of this term is\nthat of numerical identity over time: what makes some person at time\nt1 the same person as the person at time t2? (see SEP entry on\n identity over time).\n This is, in the first instance, a metaphysical question and not our\ninterest here. A different sense of \u201cidentity\u201d refers to\nthose characteristics that make one the particular person one is, as\njudged both by oneself and by others. This includes narrative,\nbiographical, and practical identities. It is less about criteria for\nsameness over time and more about the constitutive or defining\nfeatures of one\u2019s self- (or social) conception. This is the\nsense of \u201cidentity\u201d we will be concerned with.\n\nThe sense of individual identity most directly relevant to respect and\nrecognition is arguably that of practical identity. Following\nKorsgaard (1996, 2009), we can understand a practical identity to be a\ndescription under which a person values herself, where valuing oneself\ninvolves treating oneself as a source of reasons. For example, someone\nwho identifies as a mother in this sense values herself under the\ndescription \u201cmother\u201d and for that reason treats the fact\nthat she is a mother as a source of (normative practical) reasons.\nMoreover, to \u201cdrop\u201d this identification is not like\ndropping a desire or short-term goal. It involves changing one\u2019s\nsense of who one is as a person and what gives one\u2019s life\nvalue.\n\nOn this view, a person\u2019s practical identities should be\nnormatively significant for other people as well. For one thing, many\nof a person\u2019s significant interests are derived from\nher practical identities. Since it is uncontroversial that respect and\nconcern require giving appropriate weight to the interests of others,\nit follows that respect and concern require giving appropriate weight\nto other people\u2019s practical identities, at least insofar as they\ngenerate (legitimate) interests. In addition, respecting a\nperson\u2019s practical identities plausibly falls under a more\ngeneral requirement of respect for personal autonomy. Personal\nautonomy is a foundational value of liberal democracies, whose laws\nand policies do not require individuals to organize their lives around\nany particular identity, but rather give them the latitude to make of\ntheir identities what they will (Appiah 2005; Appiah and Gutmann 1996;\nsee also the SEP entry on\n identity politics).\n This can be seen as a part of liberalism\u2019s broader commitment\nto neutrality about conceptions of the good (e.g., Rawls 1993).\n\nThese issues become especially charged if we move from individual to\ngroup identities, bringing us closer to the question of disability\nidentities. As K. Anthony Appiah points out, though individual\nidentity is different from group identity, it nevertheless has a\ncollective or social dimension (Appiah 2005: 21). For example,\nPalestinians living in the West Bank have a distinct collective\nidentity. This is different from, though certainly compatible with,\nsome specific West Bank resident having as part of his individual\nidentity being a\n Palestinian.[9]\n It is important to bear this distinction between individual and\ncollective identities in mind, because the latter, to a greater extent\nthan the former, is imposed or \u201cascribed\u201d by the larger\nsociety rather than chosen by the individual.\n\nBeing disabled, like being a member of a minority race, subjects one\nto particular treatment. But one can experience that treatment without\nfeeling compelled to regard one\u2019s disability or minority status\nas part of one\u2019s individual identity in the practical sense of\nbeing a description under which one values oneself. Often, having a\ndisability identity ascribed to one, like having a racial identity\nascribed, consists in part in being the object of, and provides an\nexcuse for, discriminatory, demeaning or degrading treatment of\nvarious sorts. This is so both for people whose impairments are\nimmediately observable and for those whose impairments are hidden but\nsubject to exposure and ridicule by a temporary change in appearance,\ne.g., a person with epilepsy who has a seizure in public (Schneider\nand Conrad 1985; more generally, Davis 2005). And since this social\nidentity is often part of one\u2019s individual identity, such\ntreatment is likely to be injurious to the self-respect of the one\nwith this identity, and in that sense constitute an instance of\nmisrecognition. Ironically, the fact of being unfairly stereotyped can\nitself shape the identities of those who are treated in this way, as\nAppiah notes, even if initially they did not identify strongly with\nthe group in question.\n\nDesirable change with respect to social identities is possible in at\nleast two ways. First, even if some important aspects of one\u2019s\nself are not chosen\u2014say, the fact that one has paraplegia or\ndeafness\u2014how central they are to one\u2019s self-conception,\nhow much they matter to one\u2019s interests and plans, is to some\nextent within one\u2019s voluntary control. On some views, notably\nKorsgaard\u2019s, reflective endorsement of an identity is a\nnecessary condition of its being normative for the agent, i.e.,\nproviding reasons for her. At the same time, the extent to which\none\u2019s identifications are voluntary depends on the constraints\nof the social environment. One cannot simply decide to make\none\u2019s disability a less salient feature of one\u2019s\nbiographical identity, at least, especially if one\u2019s disability\nis not \u201chidden\u201d. If the identity is ascribed, and\nemphasized, by the larger society, it may be difficult to reduce its\nimportance in one\u2019s own practical reasoning. But one still has\nsome choice about whether to accept or resist that emphasis.\n\nSecond, there can be a change in the valence of the label, as\nthere has been with the term \u201cqueer\u201d: what was once a\nnegative label, accompanied by unjust treatment of various sorts, can\nbe transformed into a positive label and championed as a source of\nself-respect and pride for those who share in the collective identity.\nJohn Lawson discusses how special education for disabled children,\nonce seen as a major factor in the creation of a negative,\nsecond-class identity, can be transformed into \u201csites for the\npositive promotion of disability as a cultural identity\u201d (Lawson\n2001: 203\u201321). Neither sort of change\u2014in identification or\nvalence\u2014can be accomplished without struggle, personal as well\nas political, but partial success is sometimes achievable.\n\nEven if disability is not and does not have to be a central component\nof every disabled person\u2019s identity, this does not negate the\nsignificance of disability as an organizing principle of political\naction. But when the social and political recognition of disability\nbecomes the objective of political action, as it is in identity\npolitics, it gives rise to the \u201cdilemma of difference\u201d\n(Minow 1990). Consider special education for children: On the one\nhand, labeling a child \u201cdisabled\u201d risks stigmatizing and\nisolating the child. In this sense, to be \u201cdifferent\u201d is\nto be inferior. Alternatively, being labeled \u201cdisabled\u201d is\na way for parents to secure attention to the child\u2019s particular\nways of learning and functioning. In this sense, to be\n\u201cdifferent\u201d is to be entitled to appropriate educational\nassistance.\n\nThe dilemma may not be insurmountable. The movement for universal\ndesign in education aims to refashion classrooms and teaching\npractices to encourage the participation of all students. To the\nextent that the movement is successful, it will minimize the need for\n\u201cspecial education\u201d (Biklen 1992; Gartner and Lipsky 2002;\nLipsky and Gartner 1996). Law and public policy must think creatively\nabout ways to solve this dilemma so that the stigma they seek to\neliminate is not in effect reinforced. Success in resolving the\ndilemma of difference may reduce the importance of disability identity\nfor justice. If disability is simply a characteristic to be taken\naccount of in social arrangements, it could become as significant or\ninsignificant as height or aptitude.\n\nThere are at least two other risks for an identity politics of\ndisability. One involves the danger of assuming that the members of a\nparticular marginalized group all share the same culture, be it\nAfrican-American culture or disability culture. This assumption is not\nrequired by a mature identity politics, but it may be encouraged by\nefforts to mobilize diverse individuals around a single identity. Two\nconsiderations may help to resist this tendency. First, we must\nrecognize that culture is a complex concept, and that defining it is\nno easy task. Second, we must recognize that on any plausible\ndefinition, people with the same disability (let alone different\ndisabilities) need not share a common culture. There are some examples\nof a shared disability culture: Deaf culture is perhaps the best\nknown. But many people who are deaf, particularly those who do not\nsign, do not identify as Deaf or take part in Deaf culture (Tucker\n1997[10]\n And even for those who participate, Deaf culture does not appear to\nbe the kind of \u201cencompassing\u201d or\n\u201ccomprehensive\u201d culture claimed by Kymlicka, Margalit, and\nRaz to provide a \u201ccontext of choice\u201d for its\n members.[11]\n\nThe second, related risk involves privileging one identity over\nothers. This is especially important for people with multiple or\n\u201cintersectional\u201d identities. People who are\nAfrican-American and disabled, or female and disabled, or disabled and\nLGBT may sometimes feel a conflict between those identities. In one\nstudy, for example, African-American women with mobility impairments\nreported that they felt estranged from the disability-rights movement,\npartly because its leadership seemed predominantly white, and partly\nbecause some of its principal goals\u2014to maximize\nindependence\u2014went against their more communal values, which\nemphasized family and co-dependence (Feldman and Tegart 2003). More\ngenerally, although there has been comparatively little discussion of\nthe intersection between disability and race within philosophical work\non disability (though see Stubblefield 2009), more discussion can be\nfound in disability studies more generally (e.g., Bell 2011). Also,\nsome have noted that mainstream feminism\u2019s focus on independence\nand self-sufficiency has tended to exclude women with disabilities,\nwho are perceived as lacking in these cardinal virtues (Crawford and\nOstrove 2003; Wendell 1996). At the same time, disabled women are\noften particularly vulnerable to the injustices that motivate the\nfeminist movement: they are frequently victims of sexual exploitation\n(Crawford and Ostrove 2003), encounter many obstacles to leaving\ndissatisfying relationships because of physical, psychological and\nfinancial dependency (Olkin 2003), and have median incomes below the\npoverty line and substantially lower than those of their male\ncounterparts (Crawford and Ostrove 2003; Olkin 1999).\n\nIn addition to these potential risks associated with emphasizing\nidentity politics for persons with disabilities and other stigmatized\nminorities, there have been several major challenges in mobilizing\npeople with disabilities around an affirmative group or cultural\nidentity. The first, addressed by the disability rights movement, was\ngetting people with disabilities to recognize that they have something\nin common with others who are differently impaired but also suffer\nstigma and exclusion because of their impairment. This has been\ndifficult because people who are born with disabilities or acquire\nthem in childhood come from widely dispersed socioeconomic, geographic\nand racial groups (Scotch 1988) and so are less likely to grow up with\na sense of group identity. Another obstacle has been the\noverwhelmingly negative connotation of the label\n\u201cdisabled\u201d. Indeed, the challenge for people with visual,\nmotor, and psychiatric impairments has been to recognize that they\nshare a \u201cdisabled\u201d identity while denying that this makes\nthem dependent, child-like, or powerless (Asch 1985; Scotch 1988);\nsuch a self-identity would quite literally disable\none\u2019s capacity for social participation and political\naction.\n\nIt is instructive to compare how the medical and social models would\naddress these challenges. The medical model suggests a disability\nidentity that is both fragmented and negative. Because the medical\nmodel defines disability in terms of particular physical or mental\nimpairments, the primary commonalities it recognizes among disabled\npeople are strictly functional; it views the blind person and the deaf\nperson as having very different problems. Although it could recognize\nthe fact that such biomedically distinct conditions had similar social\nconsequences\u2014stigmatization and exclusion\u2014it would treat\nthose similar consequences merely as secondary effects of the two\nconditions. Even within a single impairment, a medical model\nencourages distinctions based on etiology. For example, it would\ndistinguish blindness due to Leber\u2019s congenital amaurosis from\nblindness due to retinaopathy of prematurity, focusing on genetic\ntesting for the former and treatment for the latter, and placing less\nemphasis on the shared challenges of living with blindness. Although\nthis narrow focus may be appropriate for the purposes of clinical\nintervention, it obscures the recognition of disability as a social\nand political problem, except insofar as it raises perennial questions\nabout how to distribute scarce health-care resources (Barnartt et al.\n2001).\n\nIn contrast, the various social models were explicitly formulated to\nsupport a disability identity that could serve as the basis for claims\nof respect and recognition. The inclusion of people with a vast array\nof different impairments in United States and other national civil\nrights laws, and the creation of the United Nations convention on the\nrights of persons with disabilities, have helped to forge a shared\ndisability identity. The emergence of disability studies as a\nrecognized field of academic inquiry has also contributed. The\nminority group model promotes a trans-impairment identity by treating\npeople with disabilities as a \u201cdiscrete and insular\nminority\u201d making claims on a generally stigmatizing able-bodied\nmajority. Though the minority group model has proven extremely useful\nin passing anti-discrimination laws, it may do so at the expense of\nemphasizing the differences between people with disabilities\nand people without them, rather than highlighting the many ways in\nwhich identity need not be tied to the presence or absence of an\nimpairment. The human variation model tempers this emphasis, and\nresists essentialism about disability identity, by treating the group\nitself as socially constructed. It sees the category of \u201cthe\ndisabled\u201d as resting on an artificial dichotomy imposed on a\ncontinuum of variation. The conceptualization of disability as just\none source of difference, and as a difference in kind more than\ndegree, can undercut a sense of disability as the basis for a unique\nand exclusive identity.\n\nThe more the redesign of the physical and social environment is guided\nby a thoroughgoing human-variation model, the less dominant disability\nidentity and identity politics may become for people with\ndisabilities. A society in which disabilities lack the social and\npractical significance they currently have may be one in which the\nequality of people with disabilities can be fully recognized without\nhaving to treat disability as a salient feature of their\nidentities.\n\nIt may be, though, that the physical, sensory, or psychic experience\nof a particular impairment turns out to be central and salient to how\nthose with the impairment live\u2014even in a society deeply\ncommitted to inclusion, participation, and non-discrimination. Perhaps\ncommunicating primarily gesturally and not vocally, or moving through\nthe world with wheels and not on legs, or focusing on detail rather than context, makes the lives of people who are deaf, or\nparalyzed, or autistic sufficiently distinctive that they feel a\nstrong affinity and connection with others who have the same\nimpairment (see SEP entry on\n disability: definitions, models, experience\n for a discussion of this claim.) Disability theorists who adopt\ndifferent social model approaches might profitably consider how\ndifferent views about group and individual identity apply to people\nwith disabilities.\n\nThe connection between different models of disability and different\nways of understanding disability identity points us in the direction\nof an important category of injustice, in addition to the distributive\nand relational conceptions already discussed. This is epistemic\ninjustice (Fricker 2007; Barnes, 2016). Epistemic injustice\nconsists in a person\u2019s being wronged in her capacity as an\nepistemic subject. Testimonial injustice consists in\nsomeone\u2019s being wronged in her capacity as a subject of\nknowledge, while hermeneutical injustice consists in\nsomeone\u2019s being wronged in her capacity as a subject of\nunderstanding. More specifically, testimonial injustice consists in\nsomeone\u2019s testimony being given less credence than the evidence\nwarrants due to prejudice on the part of the hearer, while\nhermeneutical injustice consists in someone\u2019s experiences being\nobscured from individual and collective understanding due to wrongful\nexclusion from the practices by which those understandings are\ngenerated. Both have clear implications for disability, justice, and\nidentity.\n\nFor example, consider the use of quality-adjusted life years (QALYs)\nto assess the prospective benefits of health care interventions. The\nstandard method of \u201cquality adjustment\u201d involves (i)\nassigning a value of 1 to each life-year one can reasonably expect to\nsave through a given intervention, and (ii) discounting each life-year\nthat would be lived by a person with a disability by some coefficient\n(between 0 and 1) which is thought to reflect the badness of living\nwith the disability in question. These coefficients are typically\narrived at by asking people how many years of life with the\ndisability people would be willing to exchange for each year of life\nwithout the disability. For example, suppose survey data\nindicate that people would trade 8 years of life with blindness for 4\nyears of life with sight. The method of quality-adjustment would\nassign a QALY of 0.5 to each year of life lived with blindness. The\nupshot is that saving nondisabled life-years provides more \u201cbang\nfor your buck\u201d in the QALY model, and as such is to be preferred\nto saving disabled life-years.\n\nThis implication has led some to criticize the method of\nquality-adjustment on the grounds that it produces a kind of\n\u201cdouble jeopardy:\u201d people with disabilities are\ndisadvantaged twice-over, first by having the disability itself,\nsecond by having their health care needs discounted for that very\nreason (e.g., Singer et al. 1995; Bognar 2011; John et al. 2017). But\nthere is another way of thinking about QALYs which takes issue with\nboth quality-adjustment and an assumption behind the double-jeopardy\ncriticism. When the \u201cexchange rate\u201d between disabled and\nnon-disabled life-years is calculated, it is primarily or exclusively\nbased the judgments of able-bodied people. This feature is\ncriticizable on two distinct grounds. One is that it disrespects the\nfirst-person authority of people with disabilities, who know\nfirst-hand what it\u2019s like to have the disability in question\n(and, if disabled as adults, know also what it\u2019s like\nnot to have the disability). This disrespect for first-person\nauthority is plausibly an example of testimonial injustice, at least\ninsofar as it reflects prejudicial or otherwise biased attitudes on\nthe part of the able-bodied. A second, related criticism is that this\napproach exaggerates the difference in quality between able-bodied and\ndisabled lives, relative to an approach that appropriately\nincorporated and weighed the perspectives of people with disabilities.\nAble-bodied people often overestimate how bad it would be to have a\ngiven disability, given popular stereotypes which depict life with\ndisability as tragic, occlusive of life\u2019s major goods, and so\non. This is plausibly an example of hermeneutical injustice, insofar\nas the poor understanding of disabled people\u2019s experiences and\nidentities results from their exclusion from the public sphere. This\nis only one example; much work remains to be done exploring the\nimplications of epistemic injustice for people with disabilities.\n",
