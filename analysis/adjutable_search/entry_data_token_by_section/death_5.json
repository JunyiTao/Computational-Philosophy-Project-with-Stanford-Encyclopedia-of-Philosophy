    "main_text": "Death || Life and Death\n2.1 Life and Death\n\nAccording to the compositional account of life discussed in the\nprevious section, objects that are alive have a distinctive capacity\nto control what they are composed of, fixing these constituents\ntogether in various ways, by virtue of the fact that their\nconstituents can engage in various self-modifying activities that are\nintegrated in conformity with information they carry. Let us call\nthese vital activities.\n\nIt is one thing to have the capacity to engage in vital activities and\nanother actually to engage in them, just as there is a difference\nbetween having the ability to run and actually running. Being alive\nseems to involve the former. It consists in having the relevant\ncapacity. To die is to lose this capacity. We can call this the\nloss of life account of death.\n\nThe event by which the capacity to engage in vital activities is lost\nis one thing, and the state of affairs of its having been lost it is\nanother. \u2018Death\u2019 can refer to either. However, the\ncapacity to engage in vital activities may be lost gradually, rather\nthan all at once, so it is reasonable to speak of a process of dying.\nIn some cases that process is especially complicated, because the\nself-modifying activities of some organisms result in the construction\nof complex physiological systems that must remain largely intact for\nthe self-modifying activities of these organisms to remain integrated.\nIn defining death, some theorists focus on these systems, and claim\nthat an organism\u2019s life ends when that organism\u2019s\nphysiological systems can no longer function as an integrated whole,\nor when this loss becomes irreversible (Christopher Belshaw 2009;\nDavid DeGrazia 2014).\n",
