    "main_text": "Quid and Quiddity\n4. Quid and Quiddity\n\n\nDietrich\u2019s account of quid and quiditas is more\nlimited. He takes up these concepts in his De quiditatibus\nentium. Where ens, entitas, esse, and\nessentia are all existential terms answering the question\nwhether something exists, in the De quiditatibus he considers\nthe question \u201cWhat is it that exists?\u201d He begins the\ntreatise by distinguishing quid and quiditas from\nthe existential terms, and then proceeds to consider the differences\nwith respect to being in substance, in logical concepts or intentions,\nand in accidents. Again, unlike Aquinas who equated essentia\nand quiditas, Dietrich sees these metaphysical concepts are\nbeing different, but not totally unrelated.And while Aquinas accepts\nthe separability of accidents, Dietrich rejects the notion.\n\n\nThe analysis which De quiditatibus provides is subtle. The\nterm \u201cquid\u201d denotes the essential mode of the\nbeing of a thing, that is, the mode of being by which it exists as a\nbeing of a certain kind. It answers the question \u201cWhat is\nit?\u201d On the other hand, quiditas denotes the formality\nby means of which a thing is a quid. It is tempting to see a\nconnection here between ens, entitas and\nquid, quiditas such that the second is the condition\nof the first. This may lead unwary reasoners, as Dietrich no doubt\nfelt Thomas Aquinas and others were, into equating entitas\nand quiditas. But quiditas denotes the formal\ndetermination of a thing. This is something over and above the being\nof the thing. It is a form, the form of a thing. But it is not the\nsame as the thing. Hence it cannot be equated with either the\nens or the entitas of the thing. Of course quiddity\npresupposes ens and esse; without its existence\nthere could be no determination of a thing.\n\n\nAccording to Dietrich quiddity is properly defined as the formal\ndetermination of a being, giving it its specific intrinsic character\nby means of which it can also be known. Strictly speaking, therefore,\nquiddity is found only in composite beings since it implies a formal\naspect of a being. Unlike Aquinas Dietrich will not allow quiddity to\ndesignate the whole composite, even if the designation is understood\nto be abstract. Strictly speaking, therefore, quiddity is not applied\nto simple beings. Maurer suggests that the reason for this is\nDietrich\u2019s adhering closely to Aristotle who in the seventh book of\nthe Metaphysics maintains that predication with respect to\nquiddity must be of another thing, hence of a composite, because it\nanswers the question why \u201cthis\u201d of \u201cthat\u201d?\nThere must be a \u201cthat\u201d in order meaningfully to ask the\nquestion \u201cwhy this?\u201d In everything having a quiddity it is\nthus necessary that there be a distinction between the quiddity and\nthat which possesses the quiddity.\n\n\nOne consequence of Dietrich\u2019s metaphysics of quiddity is that God and\nwhat the medievals call the \u201cintelligences\u201d do not have\nquiddities since they are simple beings. Aquinas on the other hand\ninsisted that for God essentia, esse and\nquiditas are identical while for all creatures the\nesse is other than the quiddity or the essence. Indeed, this\nis how Aquinas distinguishes a creature from the creator. The essence\nof the creator alone is the same as his act of existing. But, besides\nthe arguments Dietrich has raised against Thomas concerning the lack\nof such identity in creatures Dietrich finds that Aquinas\u2019 system\nfails to properly account for intelligences because as simple beings\nthere is nothing that distinguishes their essence from their act of\nexisting\u2014nothing except their being creatures. But to introduce\ncreaturehood as the distinguishing feature is to render useless the\nimportance of defining creatures in terms of the lack of identity of\ntheir essence and their act of existing. This is not a problem for\nDietrich. For him some creatures are composite, some not, but in both\nsimple and composite beings esse is the same as\nessentia. What remains problematic is the distinction of\nsimple and composite creatures in terms of quiddity. To solve this\nproblem Dietrich turns to the traditional Christian Neoplatonic notion\nof the hierarchy of being.\n",
