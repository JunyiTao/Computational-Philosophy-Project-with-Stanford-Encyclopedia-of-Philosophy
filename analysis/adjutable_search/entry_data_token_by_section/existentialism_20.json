    "main_text": "Contemporary Relevance\n7. Contemporary Relevance\n\n\nExistentialism has had a profound impact on how philosophers\nconceptualize and understand the human condition, with rich accounts\nof affectivity and embodiment, facticity (or worldliness), and the\nways in which we are constituted intersubjectively. It has opened new\npaths for philosophy to engage with concrete and acute human problems,\nfrom sexuality, race, disability, and old age to broader issues of\nsocial and political violence and oppressive relations in general. And\nthe movement continues to thrive in the academy today. Not only is the\nSociety for Phenomenology and Existential Philosophy (SPEP)\nflourishing as the second largest philosophical organization in the\nEnglish-speaking world, with smaller research groups (or\n\u201cCircles\u201d) devoted to every major figure. There is a\ncascade of scholarship published every year in leading journals and\nacademic presses that captures the enduring relevance of\nexistentialist thought, including important new work engaging the\nsignificance of French existentialism as an ethical theory (Webber\n2018), reframing our conceptions of virtue and human flourishing\n(McMullin 2019), and even addressing current analytic debates in\nphilosophies of life-extension, anti-natalism, and transhumanism\n(Buben 2022). Indeed, the core ideas and major figures of\nexistentialism are not just alive and well; they are shaping\ndevelopments in a diverse range of areas across the humanities and\nsocial sciences.\n",
