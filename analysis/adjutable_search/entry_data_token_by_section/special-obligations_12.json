    "main_text": "Extending the Moral Domain\n10. Conclusion\n\nWe have seen that the issue as to whether we have special obligations\nis relevant to some of the central issues in contemporary ethics,\nincluding the viability of consequentialism as a moral theory, the\npossibility and nature of agent-relative reasons, the relationship\nbetween voluntary action or association and the acquisition of duties\nor responsibilities, and the nature of self, family, friendship, and\npolitical community. In attempting to ground special obligations, the\ndefender of special obligations must face issues about the role of the\nmetaphysics of personal identity in determining features of morality\nand questions in moral epistemology, among other issues. Thus, the\ntopic of special obligations is central to debates in both normative\nand meta- ethics.\n",
