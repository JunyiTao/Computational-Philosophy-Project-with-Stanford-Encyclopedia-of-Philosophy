    "main_text": "Correlative Cosmology\n5. Correlative Cosmology\n\nNear the end of the Warring States Period, new assumptions about\ncosmology and metaphysics appeared that dominated the Han dynasty and\nprofoundly influenced the development of Chinese thought. This new\nview has come to be known as \u201ccorrelative cosmology,\u201d but\nit was not a single cosmology as much as several cosmological\nprinciples (Brindley 2012,\n 2\u20133).[8]\n Its core elements are various schema for sorting phenomena into kinds\n(lei \u985e) and a theory of causality based on stimulus\nand response (ganying \u611f\u61c9). These elements\nappear together in a paradigmatic statement from the L\u00fcshi\nchunqiu:\n\n\nThings of the same kind summon each other, those with the same vital\nenergy join together, and sounds that match resonate. Thus if you\nstrum a gong note other gong will resonate; if you\nstrum a jue note other jue will vibrate. Use a\ndragon to bring rain; use the form to move the shadow. The masses of\npeople think that fortune and misfortune come from fate\n[ming]. How could they know from where they truly come! (Chen\nQiyou 1984, 20/4: 1369)\n\n\nThe categories used could be more or less specific, so on one side\nmight be \u201chuman being\u201d or \u201canimal\u201d while on\nthe most general side all things could be classified as either\nyin or yang. Another of the most common categories\nwere wood, earth, fire, water, and metal, known as the five phases\n(wuxing). Yet another set were based on the Yi Jing,\nusing either the eight trigrams or sixty-four hexagrams. These systems\nof categorization were eventually integrated, so that categories from\none could be translated into the others. Given the underlying ontology\nof change and process, categorization is not based on inherent\nqualities or essences but on typical ways of acting and\nreacting\u2014does it tend to expand or contract, work gradually or\nswiftly, manifest itself obviously or subtly? Since these traits are\nrelational, the same \u201cthing\u201d may not always be in the same\ncategory (it might act like wood in one context but metal in another),\nand because they are dynamic, the categories give immediate\ninformation on how things can be controlled, directed, or diminished.\nThe application of the categories depends on context and the context\ndepends on our particular purposes, but they are meant to express real\nproperties of things.\n\nConsider the use of the most general categories, yin and\nyang. Yang labels the tendency to expand and\ndominate; yin labels the tendency to draw things in by\nyielding. Anything can be put in one of these two categories, but\nyin and yang are not inherent properties. The same\nthing that might be active and dominating in one relationship might be\nsofter and yielding in another (as is commonly the case in Chinese\nmedicine). The function of the labels can be compared to the way we\nlabel cause and effect. We can designate a cause and an effect in any\nchange, but being a cause is not an essential property. Everything is\nsimultaneously the cause of many effects and the effect of many\ncauses. As cause and effect illustrate, even a set of binary\ncategories can be helpful in analyzing situations, and\nyinyang could be specified in various ways. In the Yi\nJing, lines representing either yin (a divided line) or\nyang (a straight line) can be combined into groups of three\nto form eight trigrams, or groups of six to form 64 categories. Each\nof these lines could be taken as more or less stable, leading to 4096\npossible situations.\n\nThe conception of causality at work here has come to be labeled with\nthe Chinese phrase ganying \u611f\u61c9, \u201cstimulus\nand response\u201d. This way of approaching causality reflects the\nfact that existence is inherently active and dynamic: nothing is\npurely passive or inert. The effects of a stimulus depend on the\nreceptive and responsive capacities of the thing stimulated. One\ncommon model for ganying was resonance, as in the quotation\nabove where the vibrations of one string stimulate vibrations in\nstrings tuned to the same note.\n\nThe final element is the role of correlations. To place phenomena in\nthe same category is to situate them as having similar functions in\nanalogous configurations. To be yin is to have a relationship\nto something that is yang, to be wood-like is to stand in\ncertain relationships to fire, metal, earth, and water. This way of\ncategorizing allows correlations across what would seem to be very\ndifferent kinds of things. For example, an illness that is\nyang (expansive or overactive) can be treated with foods that\nare yin (receptive or calming). This kind of thinking is\nrooted in a concern for acting in harmony with natural patterns, going\nback to the concept of shi \u6642, which refers to the\nseasons, to the temporal configuration of a given moment, and to the\nability to act according to the demands of that moment (Sellman 2002).\nThese correlations were based on empirical observations, but as the\ncategories were integrated and extended to all phenomena, the\nconnections become less and less apparent, sometimes seeming forced\nand arbitrary. For example, for the first month that starts spring,\nthe L\u00fcshi chunqiu correlates certain days of the month,\nscaly animals, the musical note jue, sour tastes, and the\nnumber eight, but it also recommends surveying the land to set the\nboundaries of fields (so that conflicts are settled before planting\nbegins), bans killing young animals and destroying eggs (so as to\navoid shortages later), and forbids conscripting groups for war or\nmajor construction (so that they have time to plant the fields) (Chen\nQiyou 1984, 1/1: 1\u20132). These are essentially rules for\nsustainability.\n\nThe model that dominated modern European thinking about\ncausality\u2014linear causality through collision (on the model of\nbilliard balls)\u2014was not central to Chinese reflections on\ncausality (as it was not central in Europe before the late\nRenaissance). For Chinese philosophers, the paradigms for causality\nwere things like the effects of music over a distance, the\nrelationship between spring and the growth of plants, and the\ninfluence between a teacher and student. This orientation followed\nfrom belief that all things are interconnected and are ultimately\ncomposed of the same stuff, qi. It also reflected practical\nconcerns\u2014How does culture work so that people can live together\nharmoniously? How do we relate to nature in a way that is sustainable?\nApproaching causality from this direction, though, is notoriously\ndifficult. Han dynasty philosophers were basically starting from what\nwe might now call ecological thinking or theories of complexity.\n\nCorrelative cosmology posited a systematically ordered universe whose\npatterns could be grasped and mastered. The earlier quote from the\nL\u00fcshi chunqiu ends with a powerful message: people think\nsome things happen without reason or cause, attributing it to fate,\nbut they are wrong. Nothing happens without a cause, and the system of\ncauses can be known and controlled. This view placed human beings in\ncontrol of their fates.\n\nThe elevation of human power appears in the way the system of\ncorrelations provided a metaphysical foundation for what would seem to\nbe human constructs. One early example was the correlation of leniency\nand violence (or the civil, wen \u6587, and the martial,\nwu \u6b66) with the spring and the fall. This correlation\nmade the use of violence a necessary and natural principle, while also\nrestricting it to certain times. The paradigm for justifying social\norder through correlations is the Chunqiu fanlu\n\u6625\u79cb\u7e41\u9732, traditionally attributed to Dong\nZhongshu (179\u2013104 BCE). In this text, yin and\nyang remain complementary but shift from equal forces driving\ngeneration to markers for hierarchical positions in a system of\ncorrelated arrangements (R. Wang 2005). To give just one example:\n\n\nThe righteous [relationships] between ruler and minister, husband and\nwife, and father and son all derive from the Way of yin and yang. The\nruler is yang; the minister is yin. The father is yang; the son is\nyin. The husband is yang; the wife is yin. There are no places where\nthe Way of yin circulates alone. At the beginning [of the yearly\ncycle], yin is not permitted to arise by itself. Likewise, at the end\n[of the yearly cycle], yin is not permitted to share in [the glories]\nof yang\u2019s achievements. Such is the righteous principle of\n\u201cjoining.\u201d Thus, the minister joins his achievements to\nthe lord; the son joins his achievements to the father; the wife joins\nher achievements to the husband; yin joins its achievements to yang;\nand Earth joins its achievements to Heaven (trans. from Queen and\nMajor 2016, 426\u201327)\n\n\nThis cosmology ends up doing much of the work that was done by\nanthropomorphism in the European tradition. In both cases, human\nculture is seen as mirroring structures at the foundation of the\nnatural world. In the case of Europe, that foundation is seen as\nhuman-like in that we are made in the image of God, thus\nanthropomorphizing nature. In Chinese correlative cosmology, the\nopposite occurs, where specifically human phenomena are theorized as\nnatural. In both cases, social and political hierarchies are given a\nmetaphysical basis. The fact that similar oppressive hierarchies were\nrationalized and naturalized by radically different metaphysical views\nsuggests the ease with which metaphysics comes to serve the interests\nof power.\n\nHan dynasty philosophy could still be quite critical. The elevation of\nyang over yin in the Chunqiu fanlu is\npartly driven by a desire to minimize state violence, which it\ncorrelates with yin. A more radical political alternative\nappears in the Huainanzi \u6dee\u5357\u5b50, a text\ncompiled around 139 BCE. The Huainanzi emphasizes the\ninherent tendency of being toward diversification. Correlative\ninfluences generate a world that is too complex to grasp or master;\npolitically, that justifies decentralization, minimal state power, and\nthe value of diversity. Later in the Han dynasty, Wang Chong\n\u738b\u5145 (27\u2013100 CE) offers more fundamental criticisms,\nemphasizing the limits of human power to control and predict natural\nphenomena, the disjunction between virtue and worldly success, and the\narbitrariness of explanations in terms of categories like the five\nphases. This argument is grounded in metaphysics. Wang Chong\nexplicitly argues against beliefs that the world is ordered according\nto anything like a human design, claiming instead that everything\narises spontaneously, by ziran (see McLeod 2019; Henderson\n1984, 97\u2013101).\n\nThe Han dynasty collapsed in 220 CE, leading to a long period of\nfragmentation, instability, and uncertainty. The dominant\nphilosophical movement is known as Xuanxue \u7384\u5b78,\n\u201cProfound Learning.\u201d The term xuan means dark,\nobscure, or profound, but it also has a sense of what precedes any\ndivision, as it is used in the first chapter of the Laozi.\nThe best known works from this movement are the commentaries by Wang\nBi (226\u2013249) (on the Laozi and Yi Jing) and by\nGuo Xiang (?\u2013312 CE) (on the\n Zhuangzi).[9]\n Because of the centrality of the Laozi and\nZhuangzi, the movement is sometimes known in English as\n\u201cNeo-Daoism.\u201d Different philosophers held different\npositions, but the core metaphysical issue was how to understand\ndao as ultimate ground, particularly how to interpret\ndescriptions of dao as no-being (wu \u7121) and\nhow to understand the relations between dao and the concrete\nworld of experience.\n\nXuanxue was important for establishing the metaphysical\nvocabulary used in later Chinese philosophy. One of the most important\nterms is li \u7406, which in its original use was a verb\nfor laying out borders according to the contours of the land, or for\ncarving jade according to its own inherent structure. Both Wang Bi and\nGuo Xiang use li as a technical term\u2014for Wang Bi\nli refers to the patterns of coherence represented by the\nhexagrams of the Yi Jing, while for Guo Xiang li\nrefers to patterns of differentiation that spontaneously arise in the\nworld (Ziporyn 2014: 137\u201384). Li was later used by\nChinese Buddhists to refer to emptiness and by Neo-Confucians to refer\nto patterns of coherence. The latter is discussed in Section 7.\n\nA second key concept to arise is the pairing of ti \u9ad4\nand yong \u7528 (see Ziporyn 2014: 149\u2013155; Zhang\n2002: 252\u201353; Cua 2002; Cheng 2002). Yong means use or\nfunction. Ti originally refers to an organized form, a\npattern that can be recognized, or to a body or part of the body. The\npairing of tiyong was applied in different ways, but what is\nmost consistent through these uses is that ti is singular and\nyong is multiple. For example, the same piece of wood\n(ti) could have many different uses (yong): to fuel\na fire, to build a house, to carve into bowls, and so on. As in this\nexample, the multiplicity of yong comes through involvement\nin concrete circumstances or purposes. In this way, ti is\nusually less determinate than yong. In fact, the ultimate\nti was generally taken as fully indeterminate, thus allowing\nfor infinite determinate uses (yong). The contrast between\nti and yong sometimes looks like a contrast between\nthe thing itself and the various ways it can be used. Such a contrast\nis highlighted in the translation of ti as substance, but\nthis translation is misleading in several ways. First, like\nyin and yang, the labels ti and\nyong are contextual and thus the very same thing might be\nconsidered as ti in one context but as yong in\nanother. Second, the ultimate ti is almost never taken to be\nindividuated\u2014it is emptiness or vital energy or the patterns of\ncoherence (li) that all things share. So, individuation\noccurs more on the level of yong than ti. It is\nworth noting that the phrase chosen to translate the ontos in\nontology was benti \u672c\u9ad4, literally the\n\u201croot\u201d ti, a term that was prominent in\nNeo-Confucianism.\n",
