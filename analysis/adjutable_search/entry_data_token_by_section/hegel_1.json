    "main_text": "Hegel\u2019s Philosophy\n2. Hegel\u2019s Philosophy\nHegel\u2019s own pithy account of the nature of philosophy given\nin the Preface to his Elements of the Philosophy of\nRight captures a characteristic tension in his philosophical\napproach and, in particular, in his approach to the nature and limits\nof human cognition. \u201cPhilosophy\u201d, he says there, \u201cis\nits own time comprehended in thoughts\u201d (PR: 21).\nOn the one hand we can clearly see in the phrase \u201cits own\ntime\u201d the suggestion of an historical or cultural\nconditionedness and variability which applies even to the highest form\nof human cognition, philosophy itself. The contents of philosophical\nknowledge, we might suspect, will come from the historically changing\ncontents of its cultural context. On the other, there is the hint of\nsuch contents being raised to some higher level,\npresumably higher than other levels of cognitive functioning such as\nthose based in everyday perceptual experience, for example, or those\ncharacteristic of other areas of culture such as art and\nreligion. This higher level takes the form of conceptually articulated\nthought, a type of cognition commonly taken as capable of\nhaving purportedly eternal contents (think of Plato and Frege, for\nexample, who both have the truths of mathematics in mind). In line\nwith such a conception, Hegel sometimes referred to the task of\nphilosophy as that of recognising the concept (Der\nBegriff) in the mere representations (Vorstellungen) of\neveryday life.\nThis antithetical combination within human cognition of the\ntemporally-conditioned and the eternal, a combination which reflects a\nbroader conception of the human being as what Hegel describes\nelsewhere as a \u201cfinite-infinite\u201d, (SL: 114) has led to\nHegel being regarded in different ways by different types of\nphilosophical readers.  For example, an historically-minded pragmatist\nlike Richard Rorty, distrustful of all claims or aspirations to the\nso-called God\u2019s-eye view, could praise Hegel as a\nphilosopher who had introduced this historically reflective dimension\ninto philosophy (and set it on the characteristically\nromantic path which has predominated in modern\ncontinental philosophy) but who had unfortunately still remained\nbogged down in the remnants of the Platonistic idea of the search for\nahistorical truths (Rorty 1982).  Those adopting such an approach to\nHegel tend to have in mind the (relatively) young author of\nthe Phenomenology of Spirit and have tended to dismiss as\n\u201cmetaphysical\u201d later and more systematic works like\nthe Science of Logic. In contrast, the British Hegelian\nmovement at the end of the nineteenth century tended to ignore\nthe Phenomenology and the more historicist dimensions of his\nthought, and found in Hegel a systematic metaphysician\nwhose Logic provided the basis for a definitive philosophical\nontology. This latter traditional metaphysical view of\nHegel dominated Hegel reception for most of the twentieth century, but\nfrom the 1980s came to be challenged by scholars who offered an\nalternative non-metaphysical, post-Kantian\nview. By \u201cnon-metaphysical\u201d these thinkers had in\nmind metaphysics in the sense that Kant had been critical of, a point\nsometimes missed by critics. But in turn, this post-Kantian reading\nhas been challenged by a revised metaphysical view, critical\nof the purported over-assimilation of Hegel to Kant by the\npost-Kantians. In the revised metaphysical view, appeal is often made\nto Aristotelian or Spinozist conceptual realist features of\nHegel\u2019s thought, as well as to features of recent analytic\nmetaphysics.\nBefore surveying these competing views, however, something needs to\nbe said about the confusing term \u201cidealism\u201d, and about the\nvariety of idealism that is characteristic of Hegel and other German\nidealists.\n",
