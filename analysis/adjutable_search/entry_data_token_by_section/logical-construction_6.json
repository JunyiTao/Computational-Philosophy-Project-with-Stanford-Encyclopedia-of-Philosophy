    "main_text": "Mathematical Functions\n7. Mathematical Functions\n\nMathematical functions are not mentioned by Russell in the 1924 list\nof \u201clogical constructions\u201d although the analysis of\nmathematical functions is the principal application of the theory of\ndefinite descriptions in PM. The basic \u201cfunctions\u201d of PM\nare propositional functions. The Greek letters \\(\\phi, \\psi, \\theta,\n\\ldots\\) are variables for propositional functions, and, with\nindividual variables \\(x, y, z, \\ldots\\) go together to form open\nsentences \\(\\phi(x), \\psi(x,y)\\), etc. This is the familiar syntax of\nmodern predicate logic. Mathematical functions, such as the\nsine function and addition, are represented as  term\nforming operators such as \\(\\sin x\\), or \\(x + y\\). In\ncontemporary logic they are symbolized by function letters that are\nfollowed by the appropriate number of arguments, \\(f(x),g(x,y)\\), etc.\nIn chapter \u221730 Whitehead and Russell propose a direct\ninterpretation of such expressions for mathematical functions in terms\nof definite descriptions, which they call \u201cdescriptive\nfunctions\u201d. Consider the relation between a number and its sine,\nthe relation which obtains between \\(x\\) and \\(y\\) when \\(y = \\sin\nx\\). Call this relation \u201c\\(\\text{Sine}(x,y)\\)\u201d or more\nsimply, \u201c\\(\\bS(x,y)\\)\u201d, as a two-place relation. The\nmathematical function can then be expressed with a definite\ndescription, interpreting our expression \u201cthe sine of\n\\(x\\)\u201d not as \u201c\\(\\sin(x)\\)\u201d, but literally as\n\u201cthe Sine of \\(x\\)\u201d, with a definite description,\nor \u201cthe \\(y\\) such that \\(\\text{Sine}(x,y)\\)\u201d. Using the\nnotation of the theory of definite descriptions, this is \u2018\\((\\iota\nx)\\bS(x,y)\\)\u2019. The effect of\nthis analysis is that Whitehead and Russell can replace all\nexpressions for mathematical functions with definite descriptions\nbased on relations. This definition involves relations in\nextension, which are represented with upper case Roman letters\nand with the relation symbol between the variables. The definition in\nPM is: \u221730.01. \\(R`y = (\\iota x)xRy\\), with the notation\n\\(R`y\\) to be read as \u201cthe \\(R\\) of \\(y\\).\u201d As with the\ntheory of descriptions, the result of this definition is to facilitate\nthe proofs of theorems which capture the logical properties of\nmathematical functions that will be needed in the further work of\nPM.\n\nThe logical analysis of function expressions in PM presents them as a\nspecial case of definite descriptions, \u201cthe \\(R\\) of\n\\(x\\)\u201d. In the Summary of \u221730 we find:\n\nDescriptive functions, like descriptions in general, have no meaning\nin isolation, but only as constituents of propositions. (Whitehead and\nRussell 1910\u201313, 232)\n\n\nMathematical or descriptive functions are thus explicitly included\namong the incomplete symbols of Principia Mathematica.\n",
