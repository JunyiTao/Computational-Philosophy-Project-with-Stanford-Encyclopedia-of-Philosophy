    "main_text": "Explanatory Approaches to Development || Physics\n3.2 Physics\n\nFluid flow, as a physical force, is also a difference maker during the\ndevelopment of the heart, and ontogeny more generally, and\ndevelopmental biologists appeal to physical difference makers, which\nare understood as factors in producing the morphological properties of\ndevelopmental phenomena (Forgacs and Newman 2005). A physical\ncausation approach was on display in the late 19th century work of\nWilhelm His (Hopwood 1999, 2000; Pearson 2018) and especially visible\nin the early 20th century work of D\u2019Arcy Thompson and others\n(Thompson 1992 [1942]; Keller 2002: ch. 2; Olby 1986). This occurred\nin the milieu of increasing attention to the chromosomal theory of\ninheritance and attempts to explore developmental phenomena via\nclassical genetic methods (Morgan 1923, 1926, 1934). Thompson appealed\nto differential rates of growth and the constraints of geometrical\nrelationships to explain how organismal morphology originates. Visual\nrepresentations of abiotic, mechanical analogues provided the\nplausibility, such as the shape of liquid splashes or hanging drops\nfor the cup and bell configurations of the free-swimming sexual stage\nof jellyfish. If physical forces generated specific morphologies in\nviscoelastic materials, then analogous morphologies in living species\nshould be explained in terms of physical forces operating on the\nviscoelastic materials of the developing embryo. Yet morphogenetic\nprocesses that produce the shape and structure of morphology have been\nseen primarily, if not exclusively, in terms of genetics for the last\nhalf-century. Physical approaches moved into the background as\nmolecular genetics approaches went from strength to strength (Fraser\nand Harland 2000).\n\nThe molecularization of experimental embryology is one of the most\nstriking success stories of contemporary biology as genes and genetic\ninteractions (e.g., in transcriptional networks and signaling\npathways; see\n Section 1.3)\n were discovered to underlie specific details of differentiation,\nmorphogenesis, pattern formation, and growth when structure originates\nduring development. Genetic approaches predominate in contemporary\ndevelopmental biology and physical modes of causation are often\nneglected. The frustration among researchers interested in physical\ncausation during embryogenesis has been palpable.\n\n\nTo the molecular types, a cause is a molecule or a gene. To explain a\nphenomenon is to identify genes and characterize proteins without\nwhich the phenomenon will fail or be abnormal. A molecule is an\nexplanation: a force is a description; to argue otherwise brings pity,\nat best (Albert Harris to John Trinkaus, 12 March 1996; Source: Marine\nBiological Laboratory Library Archives).\n\n\nDespite this predominance of genetic explanatory approaches and the\nfrustration among researchers utilizing other approaches, a\ngroundswell of interest has been building around physical explanations\nof development, especially in terms of their integration with genetic\nexplanations (Miller and Davidson 2013; Newman 2015). Some\nphilosophers have argued that the biomechanical modeling of physical\ncausal factors constitutes a rejection of certain forms of reductive\nexplanation in biology (Green and Batterman 2017).\n",
