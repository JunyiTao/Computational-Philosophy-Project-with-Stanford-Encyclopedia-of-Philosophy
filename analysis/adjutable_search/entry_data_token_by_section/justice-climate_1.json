Assessing Climate Impacts\n\nOne question of justice that arises is \u201cWhat account of\npersons\u201d interests should be employed to evaluate the impacts of\nclimate change?\u2019 Such an account is needed for several reasons.\nFirst, we need it to design adaptation policies for we need to know\nwhat kind of protection people are entitled to and what interests\nought to be protected. In addition to this, when we are considering\nproposed temperature targets we need to be able to evaluate them, and\nto do this we need to have some account of persons\u2019 interests by\nwhich to compare the different possibilities. For many years the\nappropriate temperature target was assumed by many to be that of\nkeeping the increase in global mean temperatures from pre-industrial\ntimes to below 2\u00b0C. However, some have campaigned for lower\ntargets. This is reflected in the Paris Agreement (2015,\n Other Internet Resources)\n which specified that the target should be \n\n\n[h]olding the increase in the global average temperature to well below\n2\u00b0C above pre-industrial levels and pursuing efforts to limit the\ntemperature increase to 1.5\u00b0C above pre-industrial levels.\n(Article 2.1(a)) \n\n\nOthers, by contrast, have argued that higher temperatures are\npermissible. For example, William Nordhaus, a leading climate\neconomist, has argued that if we implement what he deems to be the\n\u201coptimal\u201d climate policy the temperature increase would be\n3.5\u00b0C in 2100 (when compared to a 1900 baseline) (Nordhaus 2018:\n348 Fig 4).\n\nTheories of distributive justice concern the just distribution of\nburdens and benefits. We therefore need to know how we should conceive\nof \u201cburdens\u201d and \u201cbenefits\u201d. Different\ntheories of distributive justice have put forward different accounts\nof what it is that persons should have fair shares of (the\ndistribuendum) (see entries on\n distributive justice\n and\n egalitarianism).\n\nWhen we consider climate change, different accounts of the\ndistribuendum are highly likely to converge in very many\ncases. Climate change results in many dying (because of severe weather\nevents, such as extreme heatwaves, flooding, and storm surges). It\nleads to droughts and crop failure and thus threatens people\u2019s\ninterests in food and water. It leads to an increase in certain\ndiseases. These impacts\u2014threats to life, food and water, and to\nhealth\u2014would be condemned by many, if not all, theories of\ndistributive justice. (For a detailed discussion of the implications\nof different accounts of the distribuenda of distributive\njustice for the evaluation of climatic impacts see Page [2006:\n50\u201377].)\n\nSome, however, would argue that to limit our focus to these interests\n(in life, health, food and water) is too narrow. They hold that some\npersons have deep attachments to certain places, such as the land that\nthey have traditionally inhabited, and that being rooted in a\nparticular place is an integral part of what makes their life go well.\nOn this view, forcible displacement results in a non-substitutable\nloss. This is highly pertinent in the case of climate change since\nmany indigenous peoples will be forcibly displaced from traditional\nhomelands. This is true both of those in small island states and\ncoastal settlements, as well as of inland communities forced to move\nbecause of environmental degradation to their traditional lands. Many\nargue, on this basis, that climate change constitutes a form of\ncultural injustice (de Shalit 2011, Heyward 2014, Whyte 2016). An\nadequate theory of climate justice must then consider whether\npersons\u2019 have such cultural rights. \n\nThis last example also helps to underscore another important point,\nnamely that which account of persons\u2019 interests is adopted can\nhave considerable practical implications, affecting what temperature\ntarget to employ and what form adaptation should take.\n\nThe key issue here concerns the relationship between persons\u2019\ninterests, on the one hand, and changes in the climate system, on the\nother. On some views people\u2019s interests are such that a change\nin the climate system might\u2014at least in principle\u2014be made\nup for through adaptation and/or through the provision of other goods.\nIf, for example, one thinks that distributive justice is concerned\nsolely with persons\u2019 wealth and income, then the loss of a good\n(such as one\u2019s house) because of climatic changes can be\ncompensated for by a transfer of wealth and/or income.\n\nOther accounts of persons\u2019 interests will not, however, sanction\nthis kind of \u201ccompensation\u201d. Those who think that some\npersons\u2019 good is bound up with a certain place or territory will\nthink that climate change inflicts on such people a loss that cannot\nbe compensated for. Protecting their interests necessarily requires\nthe environment to be a certain way (de Shalit 2011; Heyward 2014 esp.\n156\u2013157; Whyte 2016).\n\nTo put the point in other words, the key concern is about\n\u201csubstitutability\u201d (Neumayer 2003: 37\u201340). The\nquestion is whether one can substitute the loss of nature with the\nprovision of other goods. Different accounts of justice will yield\ndifferent answers to this. This take us to a long-standing debate in\necological economics and ethics between proponents of what has been\ntermed \u201cweak sustainability\u201d (which permits the\nsubstitution of capital for the loss of nature) and proponents of\n\u201cstrong sustainability\u201d (which denies the possibility of\nsuch substitution) (Neumayer 2003).\n\nFour further points are in order.\n\nFirst, it would be a mistake simply to employ an account of the\ndistribuendum and then apply that to evaluate climatic\nimpacts without considering whether that account adequately reflects\nthe values and ethical orientations of affected communities. See, in\nthis context, Krushil Watene\u2019s (2016) evaluation of the extent\nto which the \u201ccapability\u201d approach can accommodate the\ninsights of Maori philosophy concerning the value of nature. (See\nentry on\n capability approach\n for information on the capability approach and relevant sources.)\n\nSecond, it is worth noting that once one has an account of the\nrelevant interests a further question is how one incorporates them\ninto a theory of justice. For example, some have argued that many of\nthe adverse impacts described above can accurately be described as\nthreatening people\u2019s human rights (Caney 2010b). This view\nmaintains that persons have certain human rights\u2014to life,\nhealth, water, food, not to be displaced\u2014and that climate change\nis unjust because it violates these human rights. Others are sceptical\nof the applicability of human rights, arguing that they are too\ninflexible and are unable to provide guidance when trade-offs are\nnecessary (Moellendorf 2014: 24\u201326 & 230\u2013235).\n\nMoellendorf suggests that we should instead adopt what he terms an\n\u201cAntipoverty Principle\u201d: this judges climate impacts (and\nclimate policies) in terms of their impact on poverty (Moellendorf\n2014: 22\u201324). This, however, will be vulnerable to the objection\nthat it is unduly narrow in its focus, for climate change has harmful\neffects that cannot simply be reduced to its effect on poverty levels\n(such as its effects on political self-determination, \npeople\u2019s ability to practise their traditional ways of life, and\ntheir right not to be displaced) (Gardiner 2017: 441\u2013443).\n\nAnother approach would be to follow the practice of many climate\neconomists. They employ what they term the \u201csocial cost of\ncarbon\u201d where this calculates \u201ca monetized value of the\npresent and future damages caused by the emission of a ton of\nCO2\u201d (Fleurbaey et al. 2019: 84). What stance one\nadopts here will, then, depend on one\u2019s more general theory of\njustice and normative public policy.\n\nThird, the focus so far has been on the entitlements of individuals.\nHowever, some will argue that this is too restrictive and that a\ncomprehensive account would include the rights of collective units to\nbe self-determining. The clearest and starkest (but not, of course,\nthe only) illustration of this is the destruction of small island\nstates.\n\nFourth, the focus, so far, has been on the impacts on human beings. On\nsome accounts, this is incomplete for it excludes nonhuman animals\n(Cripps 2013: chapter 4). Clearly, evaluating such claims raises\nquestions that go beyond this entry. The point here is just that if\nthe interests of other creatures are included then this will have\nimplications for the evaluation of climatic impacts.\n",
