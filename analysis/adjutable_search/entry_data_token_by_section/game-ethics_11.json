    "main_text": "Analyzing Morally Significant Social Issues || Nuclear Conflict\n5.1 Nuclear Conflict\n\nMany of the early advances in game theory were made during World War\nII and the early stages of the Cold War by individuals working with\norganizations interested in advancing our understanding of nuclear\nconflict. John von Neumann, for instance, whose early contributions to\ngame theory we described in section 1, did work for the Manhattan\nProject that was instrumental in the development of nuclear weapons,\nand he is often credited with having developed the strategy of\nmutually assured destruction (MAD) that played a prominent role in\nCold War nuclear policy (Macrae 1992). MAD is a policy governing the\nuse of nuclear weapons whereby nuclear powers avoid nuclear conflict\nby credibly threatening to retaliate against a nuclear first strike\nwith a nuclear strike that would be destructive enough to negate any\nstrategic or tactical advantage of a first strike.\n\nUnsurprisingly, ethical issues associated with the use of nuclear\nweapons would eventually receive extensive attention in the\nphilosophical literature. Much of this work focused on how nuclear\nethics raises problems for utilitarian or deontological approaches to\nethics, especially the question of whether it\u2019s acceptable to\nthreaten great evil so that it might be avoided. And, while most of\nthe philosophers working in this area made little use of game theory,\nmany of the questions they addressed were framed by the important work\nof Gregory Kavka, Russell Hardin, and a few others who made extensive\nuse of both formal and informal game theoretic tools (see, e.g., Kavka\n1987; R. Hardin 1983; Gauthier 1984; MacLean 1984). In particular,\nthis work helped identify a number of paradoxes associated with MAD\nand other theories of deterrence, clarified the case both for and\nagainst unilateral disarmament, and would have implications for more\ngeneral debates about rationality (especially debates concerning the\nnature of intentions and whether modularity is a demand of\nrationality).\n\nThe analysis of nuclear conflict was also responsible for many of the\nearly developments in cooperative game theory. Among the earliest\nexamples of this kind of work was Lloyd Shapley and Martin\nShubik\u2019s effort to predict the behavior of members of the United\nNations Security Council (Shapley & Shubik 1954). The\nShapley-Shubik power index quantifies the likelihood that any given\nmember of a voting body casts a deciding vote. This provides a measure\nof the influence of each member and helps us analyze how likely\nvarious coalitions are to form, how stable those coalitions will be,\nand how the gains secured by a winning coalition will be\ndistributed.\n\nPerhaps the most influential application of game theory to problems\nassociated with nuclear conflict is found in Schelling\u2019s seminal\nworks The Strategy of Conflict (1960)and Arms and\nInfluence (1966) which together reshaped the game-theoretic\nanalysis of conflict. One of Schelling\u2019s most important insights,\nwhich the prospect of nuclear war makes especially clear, was the\nobservation that only in rare circumstances are the interests of\nparties engaged in conflict completely opposed. This led Schelling to\nemphasize the ways conflict creates and shapes opportunities for\nbargaining and cooperation. These were issues that had increasingly\ncome to be studied using the tools of cooperative game theory, but\nSchelling would revitalize non-cooperative game theory by showing how\nsuch issues could be more productively analyzed through\nnon-cooperative approaches. Arms races to develop more effective\nnuclear weapons, and the extensive efforts that governments make to\nguard nuclear secrets, are also emblematic of the importance of\ninformation and timing to the analysis of conflict, and the emphasis\nSchelling placed on these issues would lead game theorists to\nre-prioritize the extensive form analysis of games that is better able\nto capture the influence of incomplete information and the dynamic\nnature of conflict. Finally, tying together many of the issues\nsketched above is Schelling\u2019s early work on commitment and\nthreats. As Schelling showed, by pre-committing to a costly course of\naction (or by limiting one\u2019s future options) an agent can\ninfluence the actions of other agents with whom she is engaged in\nconflict. In fact, Schelling showed that in some cases irrationality\ncan even be an advantage, an argument that Kavka (1987) would develop\nfurther in the context of deterrence.\n",
