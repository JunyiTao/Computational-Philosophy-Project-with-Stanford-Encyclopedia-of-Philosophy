    "main_text": "Misinterpretations\n3. Misinterpretations\n\nDoes the principle of double effect play the important explanatory\nrole that has been claimed for it? To consider this question, one must\nbe careful to clarify just what the principle is supposed to explain.\nThree misinterpretations of the principle\u2019s force or range of\napplication are common.\n\nFirst, the Doctrine of Double Effect does not claim that the fact that\na harm was foreseen and not intended by an agent is sufficient to\nexplain the permissibility of causing it. Applications of double\neffect always presuppose that some kind of proportionality condition\nhas been satisfied and plausible accounts of double effect require\nagents to minimize harms brought about as side effects. Classifying\ncivilian casualties during wartime as merely foreseen but unintended\nside effects of pursuing a military objective does not show that the\nagents were not morally responsible for these consequences or that\nthey were permissibly brought about. Quite obviously, a\nphysician\u2019s justification for administering drugs to relieve a\npatient\u2019s pain while foreseeing the hastening of death as a side\neffect does not depend only on the fact that the physician foresees\nbut does not intend the hastening of death; that explanation could not\njustify treating the pain of kidney stones with a lethal dose of\nmorphine.\n\nA second misinterpretation is fostered by applications of double\neffect that contrast the foreseen harms that one permissibly\nallows to occur with intended harms that one impermissibly\ncauses by acting to promote a good end. The distinction\nbetween causing and allowing can be distinguished from the distinction\nbetween intended and merely foreseen consequences of acting (see\n Doing vs. Allowing Harm).\n\nA third misinterpretation of double effect bases the impermissibility\nof causing harm as a means to a good end on the fact that it is\nwrongful in itself to intend to cause harm. There are many\ncircumstances in which agents may cause harms as a means to a good end\nand in such cases, producing a harm as a means to a good end is\ncompatible with having an appropriate attitude toward the harm.\nSurgeons may amputate limbs to save lives while regretting the damage,\nthe disfigurement, and the disability that their actions will cause. A\ndentist may apologetically probe while instructing her patient\n\u201ctell me where it hurts\u201d. This is why plausible accounts\nof double effect insist on the importance of the proportionality\ncondition and the requirement to minimize harm and to seek less\nharmful alternatives: it is directed at agents who aim at good ends\nand seek guidance about what they may do to promote them.\n",
