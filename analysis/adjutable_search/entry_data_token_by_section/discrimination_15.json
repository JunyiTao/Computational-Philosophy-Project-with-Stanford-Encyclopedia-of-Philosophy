    "main_text": "Intersectionality\n7. Intersectionality\n\n\nKimberl\u00e9 Crenshaw (1998 [1989]) introduced the idea of\nintersectionality in her account of the distinctive form of\ndiscrimination faced by black women. Intersectionality refers to the\nfact that one and the same person can belong to several distinct\ngroups, each of whose members are victimized by widespread\ndiscrimination. This overlapping membership can generate experiences\nof discrimination that are very different from those of persons who\nbelong to just one, or the other, of the groups.  Thus, Crenshaw\nargues that \u201cany analysis that does not take intersectionality\ninto account cannot sufficiently address the particular manner in\nwhich Black women are subordinated\u201d (1998: 315).\n\n\nCrenshaw\u2019s idea of intersectionality applies beyond race and\ngender to cover any social groups against which discrimination is\ndirected: discrimination is inflected in different ways depending\non the particular combination of social groups to which those persons\ndiscriminated against belong. And one implication of\nintersectionality is that the disadvantages suffered by some persons\nwho are discriminated against on account of belonging to a\ncertain group might be offset, partially or fully, by advantages those\nsame persons gain by being discriminated in favor of due to\ntheir belonging to other groups. As Crenshaw notes, women who are\nwealthy and white are \u201crace- and class-privileged,\u201d even as\nthey are disadvantaged by their gender (1998: 314).\n\n\nThe idea of intersectionality threatens to destabilize the concept of\ndiscrimination. The idea highlights what is problematic about any\naccount of discrimination that abstracts from how different salient\nidentities converge to shape the experiences of persons. But, taken to\nthe hilt, the idea of intersectionality might appear to undermine any\nfeasible account of discrimination. Reflection on Crenshaw\u2019s own\nintersectional account illustrates the point: she examines the\nintersection of race and gender but abstracts from other salient\nsocial identities, such as disability status, sexual orientation, and\nreligion. Any of those additional identities can and do converge with\nrace and gender to form distinctive experiences of discrimination, and\nso abstracting from those identities seems problematic from the\nperspective that the idea of intersectionality opens to us. Yet, no\nfeasible treatment can take into account all of those identities and\nthe many more socially salient identities that persons have in\ncontemporary societies.\n\n\nNonetheless, judgments about discrimination can and do reveal genuine\nwrongs that persons suffer due to their salient group membership and\nexpose actual patterns of disadvantage and deprivation that amount to\nsystemic injustices against the members of certain salient\ngroups. It is not necessary to take account of everything\nrelevant to a phenomenon in order to understand and represent important\naspects of it. Thus, notwithstanding the complications introduced\nby intersectionality, judgments about direct and indirect\ndiscrimination can tell us something important about who is wrongfully\ndisfavored, and who is wrongfully favored, by the actions of individual\nand collective agents and by the rules of society\u2019s major\ninstitutions.\n",
