    "main_text": "Standards of Proof || Minimizing expected costs\n5.3 Minimizing expected costs\n\nExpected utility theory recommends agents to take the course of action\nthat, among the available alternatives, maximizes expected utility. On\nthis view, the standard of proof is met whenever the expected utility\n(or cost) of a decision against the defendant (say, a conviction) is\ngreater (or lower) than the expected utility (or cost) of a decision\nin favor of the defendant (say, an acquittal) (DeKay 1996; Hamer 2004;\nKaplan 1968). Let \\(c(CI)\\) be the cost of convicting a factually\ninnocent defendant and \\(c(AG)\\) the cost of acquitting a factually\nguilty defendant. For a conviction to be justified, the expected cost\nof convicting an innocent\u2014that is, \\(c(CI)\\) discounted by the\nprobability of innocence \\([1-\\Pr(G\\pmid E)]\\)\u2014must be lower\nthan the expected cost of acquitting a guilty defendant\u2014that is,\n\\(c(AG)\\) discounted by the probability of guilt \\(\\Pr(G\\pmid E)\\).\nThis holds just in case  \n\n\\[\\frac{\\Pr(G\\pmid E)}{1- \\Pr(G\\pmid E)} > \\frac{c(CI)}{c(AG)}.\\]\n\nThis inequality serves to identify the probability threshold that should be met for decisions against the defendant. When the\ncost ratio \\(\\slashfrac{c(CI)}{c(AG)}\\) is set to 9\u2014which\nmight be appropriate in a criminal case since convicting an innocent\nis often considered more harmful than acquitting a guilty defendant\n(however, see Laudan 2016)\u2014the inequality holds only if \\(\\Pr(G\n\\pmid E)\\) meets the .9 threshold. The same analysis mutatis\nmutandis applies to civil cases in which mistaken decisions\ncomprise mistaken attributions of liability (false positives) and\nmistaken failures to attribute liability (false negatives). If the\ncost ratio is one\u2014as might be appropriate in a civil case in\nwhich false positives and false negatives are equally\nharmful\u2014the inequality holds only if the probability that the\ndefendant is liable meets the .5 threshold.\n\n\n\n\nFigure 8 [An\n extended description of figure 8\n is in the supplement.]\n\n\nThis analysis only considers the costs of mistaken decisions, but\nleaves out the benefits associated with correct decisions. More\ncomprehensive analyses would consider both (Lillquist 2002; Laudan and Saunders 2009), but the basic insight\nwould remain the same. Trial decision-making is viewed as one\ninstrument among others for maximizing overall social welfare (Posner\n1973). On this account of proof standards, the stringency of the\nthreshold depends on costs and benefits, and thus different cases may\nrequire different thresholds. Cases in which the charge is more\nserious than others\u2014say, murder compared to petty\ntheft\u2014may require higher thresholds so long as the cost of a\nmistaken decision against the defendant is more significant. Whether\nor not standards of proof should vary in this way is debated (Kaplow\n2012; Picinali 2013; see also the entry on\n the legal concept of evidence).\n\nThe standard \u201cproof beyond a reasonable doubt\u201d is often\npaired with the Blackstone ratio, the principle that it is better that\nten guilty defendants go free rather than even just one innocent be\nconvicted. The exact ratio is in fact a matter of controversy (Volokh\n1997). It is tempting to think that, say, the .9 threshold guarantees\na 1:9 ratio between false convictions and false acquittals. But this\nwould be hasty for at least two reasons. First, probabilistic\nthresholds affect the expected rate of mistaken decisions. The actual\nrate may deviate from its expected value (Kaye 1999). Second, if the\nthreshold is .9, at most 10% of decision against defendants\nare expected to be mistaken (false convictions) and at most\n90% of the decisions in favor of the defendant are expected to be\nmistaken (false acquittals). The exact ratio will depend on the\nprobabilities assigned to defendants and how they are distributed\n(Allen 2014). What can be said, in general, is that the threshold that\nminimizes the expected rate of incorrect decisions overall, no matter\nthe underlying distribution, lies at .5 (see Kaye 1982, 1999; Cheng\n& Pardo 2015 for a proof).\n",
