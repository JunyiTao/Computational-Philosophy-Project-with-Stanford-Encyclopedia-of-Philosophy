    "main_text": "Main Philosophical Works || On the Divine Things and Their Revelation (1811)\n4. Retrospect (1815\u20131819)\n\nJacobi retired from the Munich Academy of Sciences in 1812 and\ndedicated himself to publishing his Collected Works, whose first\nvolume went out that same year. Beyond the many corrections and\nadditions he made to his past publications, Jacobi wrote two important\ntexts that must be considered here. These texts provide a clear\nself\u2013assessment and constitute an insightful summary of\nJacobi\u2019s own philosophical views. They include the general\n\u2018Introduction\u2019 to his opera omnia, which was\npublished in its second volume (1815), and the \u2018Foreword\u2019\nto the fourth volume (1819). They bring to light a much\u2013needed\nclarification of the relationship between reason and understanding,\nnamely that between the immediate apprehension of things (both finite\nand divine) and the systematic determination of the conditioned. A\nfinal word on the rationality of the connection between unconditioned\nand conditioned was not only needed to clarify Jacobi\u2019s ideas,\nwhich necessarily evolved over the years, but also to present his\ncontribution to a major debate in Classical German Philosophy. This\nclarification also serves the purpose of mitigating his rejection of\nidealism. Jacobi moves from a clear definition of a major portion of\nthe history of Western philosophy: ever since Aristotle, priority was\ngiven to the understanding; hence, rationality has primarily been the\ncapacity used to reflect upon objects only to connect them or their\nproperties to other objects or other properties (Jacobi, 1994(2):\n540\u2013541 and JWA 2, 1: 378\u2013379). As a consequence,\nabstraction and reflection are the only operations that have qualified\nthinking as a scientific endeavor. Jacobi stands against this\nprioritization and gives Kant credit for having redressed the original\nsupremacy of reason, the faculty of revelation and perception.\n\nJacobi stresses the need for the understanding to acquire the content\nof knowledge from two distinct faculties of perception, one\nrepresented by the senses (for finite things) and the other\nrepresented by reason (for divine things). If Jacobi seems to be\nsteering away somewhat from the theism theorized in the \u2018Von den\ng\u00fcttlichen Dingen\u2019, where reason plays a fundamental role\nin both horizons (finite and divine) (JWA 3: 85), he eventually\nconfirms that reason is the faculty that oversees our capacity to\nthink and know. Still, this supremacy does not revoke the\nepistemological function of the understanding, which, with its\nmediating and connecting, gives knowledge its subject matter and, by\ndoing so, validates the identity of the Self. This text is significant\nprecisely because it gives the understanding a specific role in the\nconstitution of the self\u2013consciousness, updating Jacobi\u2019s\nanalysis of the understanding (Jacobi, 1994(2): 547\u2013548 and JWA\n2, 1: 386. See Ivaldo, 2003: 122]. The same collaboration between\nreason and understanding in the overall project of the definition of\nthe I is again at the center of the 1819 \u2018Foreword\u2019, which\nfurther elaborates this teamwork by defining the nature of science\nitself. Science does not reject the idea of God or that of divine\nthings; rather, it limits its knowledge to finite objects, without\ndismissing the knowledge of a higher and original being, which must\nplay the role of the presupposition for all cognition. Consequently,\nthe human being finds himself in the search for God, inasmuch as he\nadmits the limitations of his own knowledge. Recalling\nSocrates\u2019s and Saint Paul\u2019s teachings, Jacobi concludes\nhis intellectual career with a Kantian admission of the essential\nreligious outcome of our self\u2013discovery, eventually exhibiting\nthe necessity of a higher order of reality.\n",
