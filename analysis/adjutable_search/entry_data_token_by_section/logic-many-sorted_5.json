    "main_text": "Calculus || Deductive Calculi\n2.1 Deductive Calculi\n\nIt is common in model theory to regard\na logic as comprising at least three different things: a class of\nstructures, a formal language to describe these structures, and a\nsatisfaction relation that determines when a formula of the language\nis true with respect to a given structure. A deductive calculus might be\nadded.\n\nIn fact, any calculus for one-sorted first-order logic can be easily\nextended to a many-sorted one; the only rules which need to be adapted\nare the ones dealing with quantifiers and substitution, as they have\nto take into consideration the variety of sorts admitted. In the entry\n classical logic\n the rules that need to be changed are: introduction and elimination\nof universal quantifier (\\(\\forall \\mathbf{I}\\) and \\(\\forall\n\\mathbf{E}\\)), introduction and elimination of existential quantifier\n(\\(\\exists \\mathbf{I}\\) and \\(\\exists \\mathbf{E}\\)) as well as the\nrules dealing with equality (\\(=\\mathbf{I}\\) and \\(=\\mathbf{E}\\)).\n\nThe sequent calculus presented in Manzano (1996: 240\u2013257) is the\nmany-sorted extension of the one in Ebbinghaus, Flum, and Thomas\n(1984). Hao Wang (1952: 106), one of the pioneering logicians working\non many-sorted logic, already introduced an axiomatic calculus for\nthis logic in his seminal work (see the\n supplement on early history\n for more information).\n\nAs usual, to symbolize derivability of a formula from a set\nof formulas we write, \\(\\Delta \\vdash \\varphi\\). We will write the\nderivability sign \\(\\vdash\\) with a subscript when needed; namely,\n\\(\\vdash _{\\MSL}\\). In any of these calculi the notion of proof is\neffective in the sense that there is a method by which whenever a\nfinite sequence of sequents of formulas is given, it can always be\neffectively determined, whether it is a proof or not. Any of these\ncalculi is undecidable, as there is not an algorithm to check\nif \\(\\vdash \\varphi\\) or not. In fact, it could not be otherwise as\nthe satisfiability problem (i.e., determining validity, or\nequivalently, testing for satisfiability of given formulas) for\nmany-sorted logic is undecidable. So, we are in the same situation\nencountered in one-sorted first-order logic.\n\nOf course, if a calculus is to be helpful it would never allow\nerroneous reasonings: it is not going to drive us from true hypotheses\nto false conclusions. It must be a sound calculus. Further,\nit is highly desirable that all the consequences of a set \\(\\Gamma\\)\nof hypotheses could be derived from \\(\\Gamma\\). That is, we would like\nto have a strongly complete calculus. In our\n section 2.3\n you will find the sketch of such a completeness proof.\nMaximal consistency and the property of having witnesses\n\nAlso standard are the definitions of the syntactic\n concepts;[7]\n namely those of consistency, maximal consistency\nand the property of having witnesses. In the present\ncircumstance, a set of formulas contains witnesses if each\nexistential formula comes with a witness (\\(\\exists x^{i}\\varphi \\in\n\\Delta\\) implies \\(\\varphi (t/x^{i})\\in \\Delta\\) for a term \\(t\\) of\nsort \\(i\\)). All three are properties of formulas and/or sets of\nformulas and in their definition we use derivability; i.e., the\ndeductive calculus.\n\nConsistency can be seen as the syntactic counterpart of\nsatisfiability, in the same sense as \\(\\vdash\\) and \\(\\models\\) would\ncorrespond to one another. In fact, Henkin\u2019s completeness proof\nbasically consists in the construction of a model for each consistent\nset.\n",
