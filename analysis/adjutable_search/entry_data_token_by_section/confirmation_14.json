    "main_text": "Bayesian confirmation theories || New evidence, old evidence, and total evidence\n3.6 Paradoxes probabilified and other elucidations\n\nThe theory of Bayesian confirmation as relevance indicates when and\nwhy the HD idea works: if \\(h \\wedge k\\) (but not \\(k\\)) entails\n\\(e\\), then \\(h\\) is relevance-confirmed by \\(e\\) (relative to \\(k\\))\nbecause the latter increases the probability of the\nformer\u2014provided that \\(P(e\\mid k) \\lt 1\\). Admittedly,\nthe meaning of the latter proviso partly depends on how one handles\nthe problem of old evidence. Yet it seems legitimate to say that\nBayesian relevance confirmation (unlike the firmness view)\nretains a key point of ordinary scientific practice which is embedded\nin HD and yields further elements of clarification. Consider the\nfollowing illustration.\n\n\\((e_{1})\\) tigers\ncarry the ND1 gene\n\\((e_{2})\\) elephants\ncarry the ND1 gene\n\\((e_{2}^*)\\) lions\ncarry the ND1 gene\n\\((h)\\) all mammals\ncarry the ND1 gene\n\n\nQualitative confirmation theories comply with the idea that \\(h\\) is\nconfirmed both by \\(e_{1} \\wedge e_{2}\\) and by \\(e_{1} \\wedge\ne_{2}^*.\\) In the HD case, it is clear that \\(h\\) entails both\nconjunctions, given of course \\(k\\) stating that tigers, lions, and\nelephants are all mammals (an Hempelian account could also be given\neasily). Bayesian relevance confirmation unequivocally yields the same\nqualitative verdict. There is more, however. Presumably, one might\nalso want to say that \\(h\\) is more strongly confirmed by \\(e_{1}\n\\wedge e_{2}\\) than by \\(e_{1} \\wedge e_{2}^*,\\) because the former\noffers a more varied and diverse body of positive evidence\n(interestingly, on experimental investigation, this pattern prevails\nin most people\u2019s judgment, including children, see Lo et al.\n2002). Indeed, the variety of evidence is a fairly central issue in\nthe analysis of confirmation (see, e.g., Bovens and Hartmann 2002,\nSchlosshauer and Wheeler 2011, and Viale and Osherson 2000). In the\nillustrative case above, higher variety is readily captured by lower\nprobability: it just seems a priori less likely that species\nas diverse as tigers and elephants share some unspecified genetic\ntrait as compared to tigers and lions, that is, \\(P(e_{1} \\wedge\ne_{2}\\mid k)\\lt P(e_{1} \\wedge e_{2}^*\\mid k).\\) By (SP) above, then,\none immediately gets from the relevance confirmation view the sound\nimplication that \\(C_{P}(h, e_{1} \\wedge e_{2}\\mid k)\\gt C_{P}(h,\ne_{1} \\wedge e_{2}^*\\mid k).\\)\n\nPrinciple (SP) is also of much use in the ravens problem. Posit \\(h =\n\\forall x(raven(x)\\rightarrow black(x))\\) once again. Just as HD,\nBayesian relevance confirmation directly implies that \\(e = black(a)\\)\nconfirms \\(h\\) given \\(k = raven(a)\\) and \\(e^* =\\neg raven(a)\\)\nconfirms \\(h\\) given \\(k^* =\\neg black(a)\\) (provided, as we know,\nthat \\(P(e\\mid k)\\lt 1\\) and \\(P(e^*\\mid k^*)\\lt 1).\\) That\u2019s\nbecause \\(h \\wedge k\\vDash e\\) and \\(h \\wedge k^*\\vDash e^*.\\) But of\ncourse, to have \\(h\\) confirmed, sampling ravens and finding a black\none is intuitively more significant than failing to find a raven while\nsampling the enormous set of the non-black objects. That is, it seems,\nbecause the latter is very likely to obtain anyway, whether or not\n\\(h\\) is true, so that \\(P(e^*\\mid k^*)\\) is actually quite close to\nunity. Accordingly, (SP) implies that \\(h\\) is indeed more strongly\nconfirmed by \\(black(a)\\) given \\(raven(a)\\) than it is by \\(\\neg\nraven(a)\\) given \\(\\neg black(a)\\)\u2014that is, \\(C_{P}(h, e\\mid\nk)\\gt C_{P}(h, e^*\\mid k^*)\\)\u2014as long as the assumption\n\\(P(e\\mid k)\\lt P(e^*\\mid k^*)\\) applies. \n\nWhat then if the sampling in not constrained \\((k = \\top)\\) and the\nevidence now amounts to the finding of a black raven, \\(e = raven(a)\n\\wedge black(a)\\), versus a non-black non-raven, \\(e^* =\\neg black(a)\n\\wedge \\neg raven(a)\\)? We\u2019ve already seen that, for either\nHempelian or HD-confirmation, \\(e\\) and \\(e^*\\) are on a par: both\nHempel-confirm \\(h\\), none HD-confirms it. In the former case, the\noriginal Hempelian version of the ravens paradox immediately arises;\nin the latter, it is avoided, but at a cost: \\(e\\) is declared flatly\nirrelevant for \\(h\\)\u2014a bit of a radical move. Can the Bayesian\ndo any better? Quite so. Consider the following conditions:\n\n \\(P[raven(a)\\mid h] = P[raven(a)] \\gt 0\\) \n \\(P[\\neg raven(a) \\wedge black(a)\\mid h] = P[\\neg raven(a) \\wedge\nblack(a)]\\)\n\n\nRoughly, (i) says that the size of the ravens population does not\ndepend on their color (in fact, on \\(h\\)), and (ii) that the size of\nthe population of black non-raven objects also does not\ndepend on the color of ravens. Note that both (i) and (ii) seem fairly\nsound as far as our best understanding of our actual world is\nconcerned. It is easy to show that, in relevance-confirmation terms,\n(i) and (ii) are sufficient to imply that \\(e = raven(a) \\wedge\nblack(a)\\), but not \\(e^* = \\neg raven(a) \\wedge \\neg\nblack(a)\\), confirms \\(h\\), that is \\(C_{P}(h,e) \\gt C_{P}(h,e^*) =\n0\\) (this observation is due to Mat Coakley). So the Bayesian\nrelevance approach to confirmation can make a principled difference\nbetween \\(e\\) and \\(e^*\\) in both ordinal and qualitative\nterms. (A much broader analysis is provided by Fitelson and Hawthorne\n2010, Hawthorne and Fitelson 2010 [Other Internet Resources]. Notably,\ntheir results include the full specification of the sufficient and\nnecessary conditions for the main inequality \\(C_{P}(h, e) \\gt\nC_{P}(h, e^*)\\).)\n\nIn general, Bayesian (relevance) confirmation theory implies that the\nevidential import of an instance of some generalization will often\ndepend on the credence structure, and relies on its formal\nrepresentation, \\(P\\), as a tool for more systematic analyses.\nConsider another instructive example. Assume that \\(a\\) denotes some\ncompany from some (otherwise unspecified) sector of the economy, and\nlabel the latter predicate \\(S\\). So, \\(k = Sa\\). You are informed\nthat \\(a\\) increased revenues in 2019, represented as \\(e = Ra\\). Does\nthis confirm \\(h = \\forall x(Sx \\rightarrow Rx)\\)? It does, at least\nto some degree, one would say. For an expansion of the whole sector\n(recall that you have no clue what this is) surely would account for\nthe data. That\u2019s a straightforward HD kind of reasoning (and a\nsuitable Hempelian counterpart reconstruction would concur). But does\n\\(e\\) also confirm \\(h^* = Sb \\rightarrow Rb\\) for some further\ncompany \\(b\\)? Well, another obvious account of the data \\(e\\) would\nbe that company \\(a\\) has gained market shares at the expenses of some\ncompetitor, so that \\(e\\) might well seem to support \\(\\neg h^*,\\) if\nanything (the revenues example is inspired by a remark in Blok, Medin,\nand Osherson 2007, 1362).\n\nIt can be shown that the Bayesian notion of relevance confirmation\nallows for this pattern of judgments, because (given \\(k\\)) evidence\n\\(e\\) above increases the probability of \\(h\\) but may well have the\nopposite effect on \\(h^*\\) (see Sober 1994 for important remarks along\nsimilar lines). Notably, \\(h\\) entails \\(h^*\\) by plain instantiation,\nand so contradicts \\(\\neg h^*\\). As a consequence, the implication\nthat \\(C_{P}(h,e\\mid k)\\) is positive while \\(C_{P}(h^*,e\\mid k)\\) is\nnot clashes with each of the following, and proves them unduly\nrestrictive: the Special Consequence Condition (SCC), the Predictive\nInference Condition (PIC), and the Consistency Condition (Cons). Note\nthat these principles were all evaded by HD-confirmation, but all\nimplied by confirmation as firmness (see above).\n\nAt the same time, the most compelling features of \\(F\\)-confirmation,\nwhich the HD model was unable to capture, are retained by confirmation\nas relevance. In fact, all our measures of relevance confirmation\n(\\(D, L\\), and \\(Z\\)) entail the ordinal extension of the Entailment\nCondition (EC) as well as \\(C_{P}(h, e\\mid k) = -C_{P}(\\neg h, e\\mid\nk)\\) and thereby Confirmation Complementarity in all of its forms\n(qualitative, ordinal, and quantitative). Moreover, the Bayesian\nconfirmation theorist of either the firmness or the relevance strand\ncan avail herself of the same quantitative strategy of \u201cdamage\ncontrol\u201d for the main specific paradox of HD-confirmation, i.e.,\nthe irrelevant conjunction problem. (See statement (CIC) above, and\nCrupi and Tentori 2010, Fitelson 2002. Also see Chandler 2007 for\ncriticism, and Moretti 2006 for a related debate.)\n\nWe\u2019re left with one last issue to conclude our discussion, to\nwit, the blite paradox. Recall that \\(blite\\) is so defined:\n\n\\[blite(x) \\equiv (ex_{t\\le T}(x)\\rightarrow black(x)) \\wedge (\\neg\nex_{t\\le T}(x)\\rightarrow white(x)).\\]\n\n\nAs always heretofore, we posit \\(h = \\forall x(raven(x)\\rightarrow\nblack(x)),\\) \\(h^* = \\forall x(raven(x)\\rightarrow blite(x)).\\) We\nthen consider the set up where \\(k = raven(a) \\wedge ex_{t\\le T}(a),\\)\n\\(e= black(a),\\) and \\(P(e\\mid k)\\lt 1.\\) Various authors have noted\nthat, with Bayesian relevance confirmation, one has that \\(P(h\\mid\nk)\\gt P(h^*\\mid k)\\) is sufficient to imply that \\(C_{P}(h, e\\mid\nk)\\gt C_{P}(h^*,e\\mid k)\\) (see Gaifman 1979, 127\u2013128; Sober\n1994, 229\u2013230; and Fitelson 2008, 131). So, as long as the black\nhypothesis is perceived as initially more credible than its blite\ncounterpart, the former will be more strongly confirmed than the\nlatter. Of course, \\(P(h\\mid k)\\gt P(h^*\\mid k)\\) is an entirely\ncommonsensical assumption, yet these same authors have generally, and\nquite understandably, failed to see this result as philosophically\nilluminating. Lacking some interesting, non-question-begging story as\nto why that inequality should obtain, no solution of the paradox seems\nto emerge. More modestly, one could point out that a measure of\nrelevance confirmation \\(C_{P}(h, e\\mid k)\\) implies (i) and (ii)\nbelow.\n\nNecessarily (that is, for any \\(P\\in \\bP\\)), \\(e\\) confirms \\(h\\)\nrelative to \\(k\\).\nPossibly (that is, for some \\(P\\in \\bP\\)), each one of the\nfollowing obtains:\n\n\n\\(e\\) confirms that a raven will be black if examined after \\(T\\),\nthat is, \\((raven(b)\\wedge \\neg ex_{t\\le T}(b)) \\rightarrow\nblack(b),\\) relative to \\(k\\); and\n\\(e\\) does not confirm that a raven will be white if\nexamined after \\(T\\), that is, \\((raven(b)\\wedge \\neg ex_{t\\le T}(b))\n\\rightarrow white(b),\\) relative to \\(k\\).\n \n\n\nWithout a doubt, (i) and (ii) fall far short of a satisfactory\nsolution of the blite paradox. Yet it seems at least a legitimate\nminimal requirement for a compelling solution (if any exists) that it\nimplies both. It is then of interest to note that confirmation as\nfirmness is inconsistent with (i), while Hempelian and HD-confirmation\nare inconsistent with (ii).\n",
