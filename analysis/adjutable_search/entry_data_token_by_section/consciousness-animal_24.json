    "main_text": "Special Topics in the Study of Animal Consciousness || Mental Time Travel\n7.4 Mental Time Travel\n\nA debate has unfolded in the literature over whether other animals,\nlike humans, are capable of thinking about past and future\nevents. Suddendorf and Corballis (1997, 2007) have argued that\nso-called \u2018Mental Time Travel\u2019 is unique to humans, and\nindeed plays a major role in explaining what is cognitively unique\nabout humans, including capacities for language and culture.\n\nMany mammals, birds and fish exhibit behavior such as food caching,\nnest building, tool use, or migration that seems to suggest\nforesight. For example, tayras \u2014 a members of the weasel family\nfound in Central and South America \u2014 hide bunches of bananas\ninside of bromeliads, recovering them only when the bananas are ripe\n(Soley et al. 2011). Skeptics are quick to point out that many of\nthese examples may be either a) \u2018instinctive\u2019 fixed-action\npatterns shaped by natural selection or b) the result of classical or\noperant conditioning, rather than behavior that is mediated by\n\u2018cognitive\u2019 processes such as episodic memory, insight, or\nunderstanding. However, the novelty, flexibility and ability to make\nsituation-specific adjustments often calls such dismissals into\nquestion. For example, tayras cache several species of bananas, and\naccurately judge for bananas of each species when the banana is mature\nenough to continue ripening once picked. This includes domestic\nbananas, to which tayras have not been exposed over evolutionary\ntime-scales (Soley et al. 2011). \n A variety of careful\nexperimental work with animals shows impressive abilities for\nintegrated what-where-when memory \u2014 the ability to recall\ndetails of an event together with its location and time. This work was\npioneered by Clayton and colleagues with scrub jays, focusing on their\ncaching behavior \u2014 wherein the birds bury food and later recover\nit (Clayton et al. 2003). For example, if scrub jays are prevented\nfrom recovering their caches for long enough, they will recover only\nnonperishable items (peanuts, in the study), ignoring their caches of\notherwise preferred but perishable food (mealworms, in the study)\n(Clayton et al. 2003). Recent work has also documented what is\nreferred to as \u2018episodic-like memory\u2019 in rats (Crystal\n2009), and the apparent ability to plan for the future (including in\nnovel ways that are not plausible ruled out as \u2018mere\ninstinct\u2019) in several animals, including nonhuman primates,\nbirds, rats and other mammals (Feeney et al. 2011 for an example of\nrecent experimental work; see Roberts 2012 for a review and\ndiscussion). \n This debate has been somewhat complicated by the fact that\nproponents of the human-uniqueness of mental time travel tend to rely\non descriptions of the ability that are laden with researchers\u2019 and\nsubjects\u2019 phenomenological, introspective or intuitive descriptions of\nthe way their own minds work (e.g. Tulving 1985; Suddendorf and\nCorbalis 2007), whereas animal behavior researchers must rely on\nstrict standards of behavioral evidence to support their\nclaims. Animal behavior researchers are typically circumspect in their\ninterpretations, limiting their claims to operationalizable terms such\nas \u2018what-where-when\u2019 memory, or\n\u2018episodic-like\u2019 memory, rather than making claims about\nthe nature of the experience that may be involved in an animal\u2019s\nperforming a task.  The situation may therefore represent a double\nstandard in the interpretation of evidence about human and nonhuman\nanimal subjects, with researchers uncritically making liberal\nassumptions about human cognition that would not be allowed for animal\nresearchers \u2014 an example of what Buckner (2013) has called\n\u2018anthropofabulation\u2019. The question of to what extent, and\nin what ways, humans\u2019 awareness of time differs from that of other\nanimals remains an open one, and an active line of research. \n",
