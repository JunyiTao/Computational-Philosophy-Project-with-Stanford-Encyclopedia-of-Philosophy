So do moral\nprinciples and moral commitments. Assuming that filial loyalty and\npatriotism are moral considerations, then Sartre\u2019s student faces\na moral conflict. Recall that it is one thing to model the metaphysics\nof morality or the truth conditions of moral statements and another to\ngive an account of moral reasoning. In now looking at conflicting\nconsiderations, our interest here remains with the latter and not the\nformer. Our principal interest is in ways that we need to structure or\nthink about conflicting considerations in order to negotiate well our\nreasoning involving them. \n\nOne influential building-block for thinking about moral conflicts is\nW. D. Ross\u2019s notion of a \u201cprima facie\nduty\u201d. Although this term misleadingly suggests mere appearance\n\u2013 the way things seem at first glance \u2013 it has stuck. Some\nmoral philosophers prefer the term \u201cpro tanto\nduty\u201d (e.g., Hurley 1989). Ross explained that his term provides\n\u201ca brief way of referring to the characteristic (quite distinct\nfrom that of being a duty proper) which an act has, in virtue of being\nof a certain kind (e.g., the keeping of a promise), of being an act\nwhich would be a duty proper if it were not at the same time of\nanother kind which is morally significant.\u201d Illustrating the\npoint, he noted that a prima facie duty to keep a promise can\nbe overridden by a prima facie duty to avert a serious\naccident, resulting in a proper, or unqualified, duty to do the latter\n(Ross 1988, 18\u201319). Ross described each prima facie duty as a\n\u201cparti-resultant\u201d attribute, grounded or explained by one\naspect of an act, whereas \u201cbeing one\u2019s [actual]\nduty\u201d is a \u201ctoti-resultant\u201d attribute resulting from\nall such aspects of an act, taken together (28; see Pietroski 1993).\nThis suggests that in each case there is, in principle, some function\nthat generally maps from the partial contributions of each prima\nfacie duty to some actual duty. What might that function be? To\nRoss\u2019s credit, he writes that \u201cfor the estimation of the\ncomparative stringency of these prima facie obligations no\ngeneral rules can, so far as I can see, be laid down\u201d (41).\nAccordingly, a second strand in Ross simply emphasizes, following\nAristotle, the need for practical judgment by those who have been\nbrought up into virtue (42). \n\nHow might considerations of the sort constituted by prima\nfacie duties enter our moral reasoning? They might do so\nexplicitly, or only implicitly. There is also a third, still weaker\npossibility (Scheffler 1992, 32): it might simply be the case that if\nthe agent had recognized a prima facie duty, he\nwould have acted on it unless he considered it to be overridden. This\nis a fact about how he would have reasoned. \n\nDespite Ross\u2019s denial that there is any general method for\nestimating the comparative stringency of prima facie duties,\nthere is a further strand in his exposition that many find\nirresistible and that tends to undercut this denial. In the very same\nparagraph in which he states that he sees no general rules for dealing\nwith conflicts, he speaks in terms of \u201cthe greatest balance of\nprima facie rightness.\u201d This language, together with\nthe idea of \u201ccomparative stringency,\u201d ineluctably suggests\nthe idea that the mapping function might be the same in each case of\nconflict and that it might be a quantitative one. On this conception,\nif there is a conflict between two prima facie duties, the\none that is strongest in the circumstances should be taken to win.\nDuly cautioned about the additive fallacy (see\n section 2.3),\n we might recognize that the strength of a moral consideration in one\nset of circumstances cannot be inferred from its strength in other\ncircumstances. Hence, this approach will need still to rely on\nintuitive judgments in many cases. But this intuitive judgment will be\nabout which prima facie consideration is stronger in the\ncircumstances, not simply about what ought to be done. \n\nThe thought that our moral reasoning either requires or is benefited\nby a virtual quantitative crutch of this kind has a long pedigree. Can\nwe really reason well morally in a way that boils down to assessing\nthe weights of the competing considerations? Addressing this question\nwill require an excursus on the nature of moral reasons. Philosophical\nsupport for this possibility involves an idea of practical\ncommensurability. We need to distinguish, here, two kinds of practical\ncommensurability or incommensurability, one defined in metaphysical\nterms and one in deliberative terms. Each of these forms might be\nstated evaluatively or deontically. The first, metaphysical sort of\nvalue incommensurability is defined directly in terms of what is the\ncase. Thus, to state an evaluative version: two values are\nmetaphysically incommensurable just in case neither is better than the\nother nor are they equally good (see Chang 1998). Now, the\nmetaphysical incommensurability of values, or its absence, is only\nloosely linked to how it would be reasonable to deliberate. If all\nvalues or moral considerations are metaphysically (that is, in fact)\ncommensurable, still it might well be the case that our access to the\nultimate commensurating function is so limited that we would fare ill\nby proceeding in our deliberations to try to think about which\noutcomes are \u201cbetter\u201d or which considerations are\n\u201cstronger.\u201d We might have no clue about how to measure the\nrelevant \u201cstrength.\u201d Conversely, even if metaphysical\nvalue incommensurability is common, we might do well, deliberatively,\nto proceed as if this were not the case, just as we proceed in\nthermodynamics as if the gas laws obtained in their idealized form.\nHence, in thinking about the deliberative implications of\n incommensurable values,\n we would do well to think in terms of a definition tailored to the\ndeliberative context. Start with a local, pairwise form. We may say\nthat two options, A and B, are deliberatively commensurable just in\ncase there is some one dimension of value in terms of which, prior to\n\u2013 or logically independently of \u2013 choosing between them,\nit is possible adequately to represent the force of the considerations\nbearing on the choice. \n\nPhilosophers as diverse as Immanuel Kant and John Stuart Mill have\nargued that unless two options are deliberatively commensurable, in\nthis sense, it is impossible to choose rationally between them.\nInterestingly, Kant limited this claim to the domain of prudential\nconsiderations, recognizing moral reasoning as invoking considerations\nincommensurable with those of prudence. For Mill, this claim formed an\nimportant part of his argument that there must be some one, ultimate\n\u201cumpire\u201d principle \u2013 namely, on his view, the\nprinciple of utility. Henry Sidgwick elaborated Mill\u2019s argument\nand helpfully made explicit its crucial assumption, which he called\nthe \u201cprinciple of superior validity\u201d (Sidgwick 1981; cf.\nSchneewind 1977). This is the principle that conflict between distinct\nmoral or practical considerations can be rationally resolved only on\nthe basis of some third principle or consideration that is both more\ngeneral and more firmly warranted than the two initial competitors.\nFrom this assumption, one can readily build an argument for the\nrational necessity not merely of local deliberative commensurability,\nbut of a global deliberative commensurability that, like Mill and\nSidgwick, accepts just one ultimate umpire principle (cf. Richardson\n1994, chap. 6). \n\nSidgwick\u2019s explicitness, here, is valuable also in helping one\nsee how to resist the demand for deliberative commensurability.\nDeliberative commensurability is not necessary for proceeding\nrationally if conflicting considerations can be rationally dealt with\nin a holistic way that does not involve the appeal to a principle of\n\u201csuperior validity.\u201d That our moral reasoning can proceed\nholistically is strongly affirmed by Rawls. Rawls\u2019s\ncharacterizations of the influential ideal of\n reflective equilibrium\n and his related ideas about the nature of justification imply that we\ncan deal with conflicting considerations in less hierarchical ways\nthan imagined by Mill or Sidgwick. Instead of proceeding up a ladder\nof appeal to some highest court or supreme umpire, Rawls suggests,\nwhen we face conflicting considerations \u201cwe work from both\nends\u201d (Rawls 1999, 18). Sometimes indeed we revise our more\nparticular judgments in light of some general principle to which we\nadhere; but we are also free to revise more general principles in\nlight of some relatively concrete considered judgment. On this\npicture, there is no necessary correlation between degree of\ngenerality and strength of authority or warrant. That this holistic\nway of proceeding (whether in building moral theory or in\ndeliberating: cf. Hurley 1989) can be rational is confirmed by the\npossibility of a form of justification that is similarly holistic:\n\u201cjustification is a matter of the mutual support of many\nconsiderations, of everything fitting together into one coherent\nview\u201d (Rawls 1999, 19, 507). (Note that this statement, which\nexpresses a necessary aspect of moral or practical justification,\nshould not be taken as a definition or analysis thereof.) So there is\nan alternative to depending, deliberatively, on finding a dimension in\nterms of which considerations can be ranked as \u201cstronger\u201d\nor \u201cbetter\u201d or \u201cmore stringent\u201d: one can\ninstead \u201cprune and adjust\u201d with an eye to building more\nmutual support among the considerations that one endorses on due\nreflection. If even the desideratum of practical coherence is subject\nto such re-specification, then this holistic possibility really does\nrepresent an alternative to commensuration, as the deliberator, and\nnot some coherence standard, retains reflective sovereignty\n(Richardson 1994, sec. 26). The result can be one in which the\noriginally competing considerations are not so much compared as\ntransformed (Richardson 2018, chap. 1)\n\nSuppose that we start with a set of first-order moral considerations\nthat are all commensurable as a matter of ultimate, metaphysical fact,\nbut that our grasp of the actual strength of these considerations is\nquite poor and subject to systematic distortions. Perhaps some people\nare much better placed than others to appreciate certain\nconsiderations, and perhaps our strategic interactions would cause us\nto reach suboptimal outcomes if we each pursued our own unfettered\njudgment of how the overall set of considerations plays out. In such\ncircumstances, there is a strong case for departing from maximizing\nreasoning without swinging all the way to the holist alternative. This\ncase has been influentially articulated by Joseph Raz, who develops\nthe notion of an \u201cexclusionary reason\u201d to occupy this\nmiddle position (Raz 1990). \n\n\u201cAn exclusionary reason,\u201d in Raz\u2019s terminology,\n\u201cis a second order reason to refrain from acting for some\nreason\u201d (39). A simple example is that of Ann, who is tired\nafter a long and stressful day, and hence has reason not to act on her\nbest assessment of the reasons bearing on a particularly important\ninvestment decision that she immediately faces (37). This notion of an\nexclusionary reason allowed Raz to capture many of the complexities of\nour moral reasoning, especially as it involves principled commitments,\nwhile conceding that, at the first order, all practical reasons might\nbe commensurable. Raz\u2019s early strategy for reconciling\ncommensurability with complexity of structure was to limit the claim\nthat reasons are comparable with regard to strength to reasons of a\ngiven order. First-order reasons compete on the basis of strength; but\nconflicts between first- and second-order reasons \u201care resolved\nnot by the strength of the competing reasons but by a general\nprinciple of practical reasoning which determines that exclusionary\nreasons always prevail\u201d (40). \n\nIf we take for granted this \u201cgeneral principle of practical\nreasoning,\u201d why should we recognize the existence of any\nexclusionary reasons, which by definition prevail independently of any\ncontest of strength? Raz\u2019s principal answer to this question\nshifts from the metaphysical domain of the strengths that various\nreasons \u201chave\u201d to the epistemically limited viewpoint of\nthe deliberator. As in Ann\u2019s case, we can see in certain\ncontexts that a deliberator is likely to get things wrong if he or she\nacts on his or her perception of the first-order reasons. Second-order\nreasons indicate, with respect to a certain range of first-order\nreasons, that the agent \u201cmust not act for those\nreasons\u201d (185). The broader justification of an exclusionary\nreason, then, can consistently be put in terms of the commensurable\nfirst-order reasons. Such a justification can have the following form:\n\u201cGiven this agent\u2019s deliberative limitations, the balance\nof first-order reasons will likely be better conformed with if he or\nshe refrains from acting for certain of those reasons.\u201d\n\nRaz\u2019s account of exclusionary reasons might be used to reconcile\nultimate commensurability with the structured complexity of our moral\nreasoning. Whether such an attempt could succeed would depend, in\npart, on the extent to which we have an actual grasp of first-order\nreasons, conflict among which can be settled solely on the basis of\ntheir comparative strength. Our consideration, above, of casuistry,\nthe additive fallacy, and deliberative incommensurability may combine\nto make it seem that only in rare pockets of our practice do we have a\ngood grasp of first-order reasons, if these are defined, \u00e0 la\nRaz, as competing only in terms of strength. If that is right, then we\nwill almost always have good exclusionary reasons to reason on some\nother basis than in terms of the relative strength of first-order\nreasons. Under those assumptions, the middle way that Raz\u2019s idea\nof exclusionary reasons seems to open up would more closely approach\nthe holist\u2019s.\n\nThe notion of a moral consideration\u2019s \u201cstrength,\u201d\nwhether put forward as part of a metaphysical picture of how\nfirst-order considerations interact in fact or as a suggestion about\nhow to go about resolving a moral conflict, should not be confused\nwith the bottom-line determination of whether one consideration, and\nspecifically one duty, overrides another. In Ross\u2019s example of\nconflicting prima facie duties, someone must choose between\naverting a serious accident and keeping a promise to meet someone.\n(Ross chose the case to illustrate that an \u201cimperfect\u201d\nduty, or a duty of commission, can override a strict, prohibitive\nduty.) Ross\u2019s assumption is that all well brought-up people\nwould agree, in this case, that the duty to avert serious harm to\nsomeone overrides the duty to keep such a promise. We may take it, if\nwe like, that this judgment implies that we consider the duty to save\na life, here, to be stronger than the duty to keep the promise; but in\nfact this claim about relative strength adds nothing to our\nunderstanding of the situation. Yet we do not reach our practical\nconclusion in this case by determining that the duty to save\nthe boy\u2019s life is stronger. The statement that this duty is here\nstronger is simply a way to embellish the conclusion that of the two\nprima facie duties that here conflict, it is the one that\nstates the all-things-considered duty. To be \u201coverridden\u201d\nis just to be a prima facie duty that fails to generate an\nactual duty because another prima facie duty that conflicts\nwith it \u2013 or several of them that do \u2013 does generate an\nactual duty. Hence, the judgment that some duties override others can\nbe understood just in terms of their deontic upshots and without\nreference to considerations of strength. To confirm this, note that we\ncan say, \u201cAs a matter of fidelity, we ought to keep the promise;\nas a matter of beneficence, we ought to save the life; we cannot do\nboth; and both categories considered we ought to save the life.\u201d\n\n\nUnderstanding the notion of one duty overriding another in this way\nputs us in a position to take up the topic of\n moral dilemmas.\n Since this topic is covered in a separate article, here we may simply\ntake up one attractive definition of a moral dilemma.\nSinnott-Armstrong (1988) suggested that a moral dilemma is a situation\nin which the following are true of a single agent:\n\nHe ought to do A.\nHe ought to do B.\nHe cannot do both A and B.\n(1) does not override (2) and (2) does not override (1).\n\n\nThis way of defining moral dilemmas distinguishes them from the kind\nof moral conflict, such as Ross\u2019s\npromise-keeping/accident-prevention case, in which one of the duties\nis overridden by the other. Arguably, Sartre\u2019s student faces a\nmoral dilemma. Making sense of a situation in which neither of two\nduties overrides the other is easier if deliberative commensurability\nis denied. Whether moral dilemmas are possible will depend crucially\non whether \u201cought\u201d implies \u201ccan\u201d and whether\nany pair of duties such as those comprised by (1) and (2) implies a\nsingle, \u201cagglomerated\u201d duty that the agent do both\nA and B. If either of these purported principles of\nthe logic of duties is false, then moral dilemmas are possible. \n\nJonathan Dancy has well highlighted a kind of contextual variability\nin moral reasons that has come to be known as \u201creasons\nholism\u201d: \u201ca feature that is a reason in one case may be no\nreason at all, or an opposite reason, in another\u201d (Dancy 2004).\nTo adapt one of his examples: while there is often moral reason not to\nlie, when playing liar\u2019s poker one generally ought to lie;\notherwise, one will spoil the game (cf. Dancy 1993, 61). Dancy argues\nthat reasons holism supports moral particularism of the kind discussed\nin\n section 2.2,\n according to which there are no defensible moral principles. Taking\nthis conclusion seriously would radically affect how we conducted our\nmoral reasoning. The argument\u2019s premise of holism has been\nchallenged (e.g., Audi 2004, McKeever & Ridge 2006). Philosophers\nhave also challenged the inference from reasons holism to\nparticularism in various ways. Mark Lance and Margaret Olivia Little\n(2007) have done so by exhibiting how defeasible generalizations, in\nethics and elsewhere, depend systematically on context. We\ncan work with them, they suggest, by utilizing a skill that is similar\nto the skill of discerning morally salient considerations, namely the\nskill of discerning relevant similarities among possible worlds. More\ngenerally, John F. Horty has developed a logical and semantic account\naccording to which reasons are defaults and so behave holistically,\nbut there are nonetheless general principles that explain how they\nbehave (Horty 2012). And Mark Schroeder has argued that our holistic\nviews about reasons are actually better explained by supposing that\nthere are general principles (Schroeder 2011). \n\nThis excursus on moral reasons suggests that there are a number of\ngood reasons why reasoning about moral matters might not simply reduce\nto assessing the weights of competing considerations. \n",
