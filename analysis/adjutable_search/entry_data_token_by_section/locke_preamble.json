    "main_text": "\n\nJohn Locke (b. 1632, d. 1704) was a British philosopher, Oxford\nacademic and medical researcher. Locke\u2019s monumental An Essay\nConcerning Human Understanding (1689) is one of the first great\ndefenses of modern empiricism and concerns itself with determining the\nlimits of human understanding in respect to a wide spectrum of topics.\nIt thus tells us in some detail what one can legitimately claim to\nknow and what one cannot. Locke\u2019s association with Anthony\nAshley Cooper (later the First Earl of Shaftesbury) led him to become\nsuccessively a government official charged with collecting information\nabout trade and colonies, economic writer, opposition political\nactivist, and finally a revolutionary whose cause ultimately triumphed\nin the Glorious Revolution of 1688. Among Locke\u2019s political\nworks he is most famous for The Second Treatise of Government\nin which he argues that sovereignty resides in the people and explains\nthe nature of legitimate government in terms of natural rights and the\nsocial contract. He is also famous for calling for the separation of\nChurch and State in his Letter Concerning Toleration. Much of\nLocke\u2019s work is characterized by opposition to authoritarianism.\nThis is apparent both on the level of the individual person and on the\nlevel of institutions such as government and church. For the\nindividual, Locke wants each of us to use reason to search after truth\nrather than simply accept the opinion of authorities or be subject to\nsuperstition. He wants us to proportion assent to propositions to the\nevidence for them. On the level of institutions it becomes important\nto distinguish the legitimate from the illegitimate functions of\ninstitutions and to make the corresponding distinction for the uses of\nforce by these institutions. Locke believes that using reason to try\nto grasp the truth, and determine the legitimate functions of\ninstitutions will optimize human flourishing for the individual and\nsociety both in respect to its material and spiritual welfare. This in\nturn, amounts to following natural law and the fulfillment of the\ndivine purpose for humanity.\n",
