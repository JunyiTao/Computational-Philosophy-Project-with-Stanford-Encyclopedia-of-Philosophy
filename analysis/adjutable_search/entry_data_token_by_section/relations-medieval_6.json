    "main_text": "Relations in Medieval Philosophy || Realism without Polyadic Properties\n3.3 Realism without Polyadic Properties\n\n\nIf we take anti-realism to be the view that (a) nothing in extramental\nreality corresponds to our relational concepts and (b) nothing is\nrelated independently of the activity of the mind, it is not hard to\nsee why most medieval philosophers would reject it. Like most of us,\nthey recognize the utter implausibility of saying that facts like\nSimmias\u2019s being taller than Socrates are somehow dependent on\nthe activity of the\n mind.[15]\n Indeed, as they often point out, this sort of anti-realism is\ninconsistent with even such basic facts as the real structure of the\nuniverse, the existence of real composition, causality, spatial\nproximity, or even the objectivity of mathematical knowledge. Speaking\nfor the majority, Ockham says in his Ordinatio:\n\n\nThe intellect does nothing to bring it about that the universe is one,\nor that a whole is composed [of its parts], or that causes in spatial\nproximity [to their effects actually] cause [their effects], or that a\ntriangle has three [angles], etc. \u2026 any more than [the\nintellect] brings it about that Socrates is white or that fire is hot\nor water cold. (Ordinatio I, d. 30, q. 1 in Opera\nTheologica iv, 316\u2013317. Cf. also Scotus, Ordinatio II,\nd. 1, q. 5, n. 224 in Opera Omnia; Aquinas, De\npotentia, q. 7, a. 9.)\n\n\n\n\nIn addition to such common sense considerations, the medievals also\nidentify various philosophical and theological grounds for opposing\nanti-realism about relations. Here we shall mention just two. First, it\nis hard to see how such anti-realism is to be squared with the\nstandard interpretation of the Aristotelian categories. \u201cFor\nnothing is placed in a category\u201d as Aquinas says \u201cunless\nit is something existing outside the soul\u201d (De\npotentia, q. 7, a. 9). Again, this sort of anti-realism seems\nincompatible with the orthodox Christian view of the Trinity. Indeed,\nit is precisely for this reason that the existence of real relations\nin God is affirmed at the Council of Rheims in 1148, and that shortly\nthereafter it becomes customary to say that the denial of this entails\na form of heresy known as Sabellianism (Cf., e.g., Aquinas, Summa\nTheologiae I, q. 28, a. 1 and De potentia q. 8,\na.1).\n\n\nBut of course, all of this raises a question. How is it that\nmedieval philosophers maintain a form of realism about relations while\nat the time rejecting the existence of polyadic properties? In\nparticular, what do they say about arguments such as Auriol\u2019s,\nwhich in effect deny the coherence of realism without polyadic\nproperties? Here it is useful to consider the work of Albert\nthe Great. Although he writes a generation before Auriol, he explicitly\naddresses his sort of argument, and the reply he offers appears to be\nperfectly standard.\n\n\nAccording to Albert, the problem with arguments of the sort Auriol\ngives is that they rely on a questionable assumption, namely: if\nthere are no real polyadic forms or properties, then there is nothing\nin extramental reality to correspond to our relational concepts.\nThis assumption would be true, he suggests, if our conceptual\nframework displayed an exact isomorphism to the structure of the\nworld. But it does not, and hence there is no reason in principle why\na polyadic concept cannot have something non-polyadic corresponding to\n it.[16]\n In making this sort of reply, Albert aligns himself with a medieval\ntradition of rejecting the view that for every distinct type of\nconcept there is a distinct type of entity. This view is often\nassociated in medieval philosophy with Plato and his followers, and by\nthe time of Ockham it is regarded, somewhat hyperbolically, as the\nsource or root (radix) of the greatest errors in\nphilosophy. \u201cTo multiply beings according to the multiplicity of\nterms\u201d Ockham says \u201cis erroneous and leads far\naway from the truth\u201d (Summa Logica I, c. 51 in\nOpera Philosophica i, 171; cf. Loux, 1974, 171).\n\n\nFor most medieval philosophers, then, the question is not\nwhether there are any things in extramental reality\ncorresponding to our relational concepts, but what these\nthings are like in themselves. Having ruled out the possibility of\ntheir being polyadic, however, the medievals don\u2019t leave\nthemselves with many options. Indeed, because they accept a broadly\nAristotelian ontology, they have no choice but to identify relations\nwith either individual substances or their monadic properties.\n\n\nAs we noted earlier, philosophers throughout the medieval period are\nattracted to the view suggested by Aristotle\u2019s\nCategories that relations (or the items corresponding to our\nrelational concepts) are accidents. Of course, as we also noted, the\nmedievals cannot take this view to be perfectly general, since they\nalso admit cases, especially theological ones, which involve relations\nbut no accidents. But even so, until the fourteenth century, this view\nis taken to apply so widely that it functions as a kind of paradigm\nfor thinking about relational situations. Thus, if a predication of\nthe form \u2018aRb\u2019 is true, it is generally assumed\nthat what makes it true is a pair of individuals, a and\nb, and a pair of accidents, F and G. As we\nshall see in the next section, it is within the context of this\nparadigmatic analysis of relational situations that one of the most\nhotly disputed and intractable debates of all the Middle Ages\narises.\n",
