    "main_text": "\n\nAbner of Burgos (Alfonso de Valladolid; c. 1260\u20131347) was\nperhaps the most important philosopher in the stream of Jewish Spanish\nrabbi-apostates in the 14th and 15th centuries.\nIn the first part of his life, Abner was an Aristotelian Jewish\nphilosopher. However, at the age of 60 (if Pablo de Santa Maria is a\nreliable source) after years of hesitation, he became a Neo-Platonic\nChristian, making him one of the very few philosophers (much less\nphilosopher-rabbis) to change his philosophical opinion (and religion)\nduring the Middle Ages. The majorities of his works are primarily\npolemical, and try to convince his former fellow Jews to become\nChristian, as he did. However, in his polemical writings, Abner built\nan original philosophical critique of both traditional Judaism and the\nAristotelian (and Maimonidean) philosophical interpretation of\nJudaism. Another part of his philosophical aim was a very radical\ninterpretation of Christianity aimed at convincing his Jewish audience\nthat his Christianity was superior to traditional and philosophical\nJudaism. Abner was one of the first philosophical and scientific\ncritics of Aristotle, as well as one of the more radical Neo-Platonic\nthinkers of Christianity during the Middle Ages. His works had a very\nimportant impact on Jewish philosophy at the latter end of the Middle\nAges, and some of his opinions influenced, through Rabbi Hasdai\nCrescas, general Western philosophy.\n",
