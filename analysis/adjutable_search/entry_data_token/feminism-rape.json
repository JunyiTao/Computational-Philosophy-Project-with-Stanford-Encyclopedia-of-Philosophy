Common Themes and the Liberal-to-Radical Continuum\n\nVirtually all feminist thinking about rape shares several underlying\nthemes. First among these is feminists\u2019 emphasis on\n\u201cbreaking the silence\u201d around rape. Feminist thought and\nactivism have challenged the myth that rape is rare and exceptional,\nshowing that it is in fact a common experience in the lives of girls\nand women. In recent decades, this awareness emerged in feminist\n\u201cspeakouts\u201d and consciousness-raising groups, where women\nshared their experiences of rape and other forms of abuse. It has now\nbeen amply confirmed by research: according to one study of over\n16,000 Americans, 18.3% of women report having been victims of rape or\nattempted rape at some time in their lives (Black et al., 2011). Of\nthese women, 42.2% were under age eighteen when they were first raped;\nan earlier study showed that these women were twice as likely to\nreport having been raped as adults (Tjaden and Thoennes, 2000).\nIndeed, many women suffer multiple rapes in their lives: in the same\nearlier study, among those who reported having been raped in the past\nyear, the average number of rapes per woman during that time period\nwas 2.9.\n\nAn accurate estimate of rape\u2019s frequency requires a clear\nunderstanding of rape itself and of the varied circumstances in which\nit occurs. Often contributing to the underestimation of rape\u2019s\nfrequency is a narrow and stereotypical conception of what rape is:\nfor instance, the image of a stranger jumping out from behind the\nbushes, brandishing a weapon at a woman he has never seen before.\nWhile such rapes do occur, the great majority of rapes are committed\nby a man or men known to the victim: dates, relatives, friends,\nbosses, husbands, neighbors, co-workers, and more. (For this reason,\nagain contrary to stereotype, most rapes are intraracial.) In the\nstudy of over 16,000 Americans mentioned above, 51.1% of female\nvictims were raped by an intimate partner, and 40.8% by an\nacquaintance (Black et al., 2011). Remarkably few assailants are\npunished: with estimated U.S. state conviction rates of two to nine\npercent of total rapes (Kim 2012, 264), \u201cninety-four to\nninety-eight percent of total rapists and approximately eighty-four\npercent of reported rapists go free\u201d (Kim 2012, 272).\n\nPerhaps the most basic challenge that feminists have posed to\ntraditional views of rape lies in the recognition of rape as a crime\nagainst the victim herself. For much of recorded history women were\nthe property of men, with their value as property measured largely by\ntheir sexual \u201cpurity.\u201d In this context, rape was regarded\nas a property crime against a woman\u2019s husband or father\n(Burgess-Jackson 1996, 44-49). A raped woman or girl was less valuable\nas property, and penalties for rape often involved fines or other\ncompensation paid to her husband or father (Burgess-Jackson 1996, 68).\nThe marital rape exemption in law, which survived in the U.S. into the\n1990\u2019s, is clearly a remnant of this approach, assuming as it\ndoes that no crime is committed when a man forces intercourse upon his\nwife, since she is his own property; the property status of enslaved\nAfrican-American women was also thought to entitle their owners to the\nwomen\u2019s unrestricted sexual use. A further corollary of this\nview was that women who were not the private property of any\nindividual man\u2014for instance, prostitutes\u2014were unrapeable,\nor at least that no one important was harmed by their rape (Dworkin\n1997, 196\u2013202, Burgess-Jackson 1996, 46-47, 69). Given this\nentrenched historical and cultural legacy, feminists\u2019\nredefinition of \u2018rape\u2019 as a crime against the woman\nherself is nothing short of revolutionary.\n\nSadly, the rate of rape reporting remains low; studies using random\nsample surveys of large numbers of women find reporting rates ranging\nfrom 16% to 36% (Anderson 2003, 78). Rates of conviction, too, remain\nsubstantially lower than for other violent crimes; some studies\nestimate a conviction rate of 5% (Caringella 2008) in the U.S.\nFeminists\u2019 recognition of the severity and pervasiveness of\nrape\u2019s harms, and of how infrequently victims receive justice,\nhas inspired decades of activism for social and legal change.\nFeminists in many U.S. states have succeeded not only in changing\nlegal definitions of rape (see below), but also in ending many\ndamaging and sexist practices in rape trials. For instance,\n\u201crape shield\u201d laws now restrict the admissibility of\nevidence about a victim\u2019s sexual history, and most jurisdictions\nhave eliminated the \u201cprompt reporting\u201d requirement, the\ncorroboration requirement, and the reciting of the traditional\n\u201ccautionary rule\u201d (that rape is a charge easy to make and\nhard to disprove). All of these practices reflect sexist and false\nassumptions\u2014for instance, that rape only happens (or only\nmatters when it happens) to sexually \u201cpure\u201d or\n\u201cvirtuous\u201d women, and that women are likely to lie about\nhaving been raped\u2014while increasing the trauma of rape trials for\nvictims and decreasing the likelihood of convictions. In addition to\npressing for changes in law and in police and prosecutorial practices,\nfeminists have founded and staffed rape crisis centers and hotlines to\nsupport victims, whether or not they choose to pursue charges against\ntheir attackers.\n\nFeminist views of rape can be understood as arrayed on a continuum\nfrom liberal to radical. Liberal views tend to regard rape as a\ngender-neutral assault on individual autonomy, likening it to other\nforms of assault and/or illegitimate appropriation, and focusing\nprimarily on the harm that rape does to individual victims. More\nradical views, in contrast, contend that rape must be recognized and\nunderstood as an important pillar of patriarchy. Johnson defines\npatriarchy as a social system in which men disproportionately occupy\npositions of power and authority, central norms and values are\nassociated with manhood and masculinity (which in turn are defined in\nterms of dominance and control), and men are the primary focus of\nattention in most cultural spaces (2005, 4-15). Radical feminists see\nrape as arising from patriarchal constructions of gender and sexuality\nwithin the context of broader systems of male power, and emphasize the\nharm that rape does to women as a group.\n\nIn addition, radical feminist approaches to rape often share one or\nmore of the following three features. First, they regard the\ndeprivation of women\u2019s bodily sovereignty\u2014in particular,\nmale control over the sexual and reproductive uses of women\u2019s\nbodies\u2014as a central defining element of patriarchy (Whisnant\n2007). As a result, they analyze rape as one of multiple forms of\nmen\u2019s sexual violence and exploitation, looking at their\ninterconnections and how they work in concert to maintain and\nreinforce women\u2019s oppression. Second, they expand the definition\nof \u2018rape\u2019 to encompass more than just overt physical force\nand violence (or the explicit threat thereof). Recognizing the ways in\nwhich broad patterns of male power systematically compromise\nwomen\u2019s bodily and sexual freedom, and challenging the equation\nof female submission with meaningful consent, they tend to see a kind\nof continuum (rather than a bright dividing line) between rape and\nmuch \u201cnormal\u201d heterosexual activity. Third, the focus on\ngroup-based oppression has also led many radical feminist thinkers to\nexamine the role of rape itself, and of ideologies about rape, in\ncreating and reproducing not only patriarchy but multiple systems of\ndomination, including racism and colonialism.\n2. Criteria: What Counts?\n\nFeminists are committed to ensuring that women\u2019s and\ngirls\u2019 experiences of sexual violation are taken seriously as\nsuch, that the harm they suffer therein is recognized, and that those\nwho inflict that harm are held accountable. Achieving these goals has\noften involved arguing that certain kinds of encounters that have\npreviously not been socially or legally recognized as rape should be\nso recognized\u2014thus, challenging overly restrictive ideas (often\nencoded in law) about what counts as rape (Burgess-Jackson 1996,\n77-86; Sanday 1996, 161-183; Bevacqua 2000). Obvious examples include\nthe abolition of marital-rape exemptions and the recognition of date\nand acquaintance rape. Feminists have also challenged the idea\n(derived from English common law) that, in order for an encounter to\ncount as rape, the victim must have displayed \u201cutmost\u201d (or\neven any) physical resistance, as well as the assumption that rape\nmust involve vaginal penetration by a penis (victims are raped orally,\nanally, and/or with fingers or objects).\n\nThere are varying feminist views about whether and how the concept of\nrape, and hence its framing in the law, requires further renegotiation\nor expansion.\n2.1 Consent\n\nBoth social and legal understandings of rape are typically based at\nleast partly on the notion of consent. (Many laws also include a force\nrequirement, about which more below.) To consent to something is to\nreverse a prima facie supposition about what may and may not\nbe done. In most contexts, there is a standing presumption that one\ndoes not have access to and may not make use of another\u2019s body,\nproperty, personal information, or other elements of his or her\npersonal domain. This presumption is reversed, however, when (and for\nas long as) the other consents to such access. Consent thus alters the\nstructure of rights and obligations between two or more parties.\n\nAssuming for the moment that, in sexual encounters, rape exists where\nconsent is lacking, the question then becomes what counts as consent.\nWomen\u2019s sexual consent has in many instances been understood\nquite expansively, as simply the absence of refusal or resistance;\nfeminists have criticized this approach on the grounds that, among its\nother untoward implications, it regards even unconscious women as\nconsenting (MacKinnon 1989b, 340; Archard 1998, 85). Furthermore, it\nhas too often been assumed that a woman\u2019s appearance, attire,\nstatus, location, prior sexual history, or relationship to the man in\nquestion either function as stand-ins for consent (that is, as\n\u201casking for it\u201d) or render her consent irrelevant or\nunnecessary. A vital task on the feminist agenda has been to challenge\nand discredit such ideas\u2014to deny that what a woman wears, where\nshe goes and with whom, or what sexual choices she has made in the\npast have any relevance to whether she should be seen as having\nconsented to sex on a particular occasion.\n\nConsent in general may be understood as either attitudinal or\nperformative (Kazan 1998). Attitudinal accounts see consent as a\nmental state of affirmation or willingness, while performative\naccounts see it as a certain kind of action or utterance (for\ninstance, saying \u201cyes\u201d or nodding). Because the kinds of\nbehaviors mentioned above (such as wearing revealing clothes, going\nsomewhere alone with a man, or engaging in heavy petting) have often\nbeen claimed by perpetrators to constitute evidence that a woman was\nin a mental state of willingness to have intercourse, feminists have\noften rejected attitudinal accounts in favor of performative ones;\nwith a performative account, in contrast, a defendant can be\nchallenged to articulate exactly what the woman said or did that\nconstituted her consent to intercourse. An added advantage of a\nperformative account is that it suggests that sexual consent is not a\nwoman\u2019s implied default state, but rather must be actively and\naffirmatively granted. Again, this is in contrast to traditional\npatriarchal views, which often assumed that unless a woman physically\nresisted\u2014again, even \u201cto the utmost\u201d\u2014a\nman\u2019s attempt to have intercourse, she was consenting (or at\nleast he was justified in proceeding on that assumption).\n\nOne limitation of a purely performative account of consent is that it\ndoes not take into account the context in which the relevant behavior\nor utterance occurs. For instance, if a woman says \u201cyes\u201d\nor even feigns sexual enthusiasm in order to keep a knife-wielding\nattacker from becoming angry and hurting or killing her, it would be\nabsurd to regard her behavior or utterance as consent (or at least as\nmeaningful consent). The question is what other contextual constraints\nand pressures may also undermine the validity of a woman\u2019s\n(apparent) consent. To put the point another way, having granted that\n\u201cno\u201d always means no, we must recognize that, in some\ncases, \u201cyes\u201d also means no. There are many kinds of\nexplicit and implicit threats that render a woman\u2019s consent to\nsex less than meaningful: the man may threaten to sue for custody of\ntheir children, to derail her green card application, to evict her, or\nsimply to sulk and make her life miserable for days should she refuse\nto have sex. Which (if any) such nonviolent coercive pressures should\nbe regarded as rape, either morally or legally, is a matter of some\ncontroversy (Schulhofer 1998; Burgess-Jackson 1996, 91-106).\n\nThe question is especially important from a feminist point of view,\nsince it is to be expected that in a patriarchal society men\nfrequently hold positions of social, legal, and/or institutional power\nover women and are thus positioned to withhold important benefits from\nwomen who refuse them sexual access, in addition to threatening harms\nand penalties. Viewing at least certain kinds of nonviolent coercive\npressures as incompatible with meaningful consent may yield the\nconclusion that some quid pro quo sexual harassment is also\nrape (Falk 1998). Furthermore, some radical feminists\u2019\ndescription of prostitution as \u201ccommercial sexual\nviolence\u201d (Jeffreys 1997) reflects an expansive understanding of\nthe economic and other coercive pressures that often compel\nwomen\u2019s consent to sexual acts in prostitution (even where\nphysical violence does not play a role).\n2.2 Mens rea\n\nA further complicating question is whether the criminal law\u2019s\nusual requirement of mens rea (or \u201cguilty mind\u201d)\nshould apply to rape and, if so, how that requirement should be\ninterpreted. In the most general terms, a mens rea\nrequirement means that the prosecution must show not only that\nnonconsensual sex occurred, but also that the man was in a certain\nstate of mind with regard to the woman\u2019s lack of consent. Just\nwhat that state of mind is\u2014what counts as mens rea in\ncases of rape\u2014is a matter of some dispute (Burgess-Jackson 1996,\n137\u2013161).\n\nThe most conservative position\u2014defended most famously in the\n1976 DPP v Morgan decision (Baron 2001,\n9\u201314)\u2014holds that a man has mens rea only if he\nbelieves the woman is not consenting (or that she is at least probably\nnot consenting). On this view, a man who sincerely believes that the\nwoman is consenting is not guilty of rape, no matter how unreasonable\nhis belief may be under the circumstances. A more moderate view is\nthat a man has mens rea if he either believes the woman is\nnot consenting or believes unreasonably that she is consenting. Thus,\nin jurisdictions where this understanding of mens rea is in\nforce, the question of whether the woman actually consented often\ngives way\u2014particularly in cases of date and acquaintance\nrape\u2014to the question of whether the man reasonably believed she\nconsented.\n\nTheorists have different views about the conditions under which it is\nreasonable for a man to believe that a woman is consenting to sexual\nintercourse. Husak and Thomas (1992) argue that there are social and\nbehavioral conventions (or \u201ccourtship rituals\u201d) by which\nwomen manifest their willingness to have sex, and that where a woman\nhas engaged in such conventions, it is reasonable for a man to believe\nshe is consenting to sexual intercourse. Archard (1997) argues\nforcefully against this view, however, pointing out that any such\nconventions are likely to be ambiguous and not universally understood\n(particularly since research shows that men routinely interpret\nwomen\u2019s behavior in more sexual terms than women mean or\nintend), that a man risks doing serious harm by relying on his beliefs\nabout such conventions, and that there is a ready alternative to\nrisking such harm, namely, inquiring explicitly as to his\npartner\u2019s consent or lack thereof.\n\nOne influential interpretation of \u201creasonable belief\u201d in\nsexual consent is that of Lois Pineau (1989), who points out that\njudgments of reasonableness in this area must be based on some\nnormative conception of healthy, normal sexual interaction. The\nprevailing conception, which she calls the\n\u201caggressive-contractual model,\u201d holds that women\u2019s\nsexually provocative behavior generates enforceable agreements to have\nsex, that male sexuality is uncontrollable past a certain point, and\nthat women are not to be trusted in matters of sexuality. Pineau\nbelieves that this model is the backdrop against which many people\nbase their judgments about reasonable belief in rape cases. The\naggressive-contractual model should be replaced, she argues, with a\nmodel of \u201ccommunicative sexuality,\u201d one that emphasizes\n\u201can atmosphere of comfort and communication, a minimum of\npressure, and an on-going checkup on one\u2019s partner\u2019s\nstate\u201d (1989, 231). Communicative sexuality is most likely to be\nrewarding for both parties, allows them to promote each other\u2019s\nsensual ends non-manipulatively and non-paternalistically, and\nobserves norms appropriate to friendship and trust. Because it is\nthrough communication that one gains knowledge of one\u2019s\npartner\u2019s desires or lack thereof, Pineau contends that\n\u201cwhere communicative sexuality does not occur, we lack the main\nground for believing that the sex involved was consensual.\u201d She\ncontinues:\n\nwhere a man does not engage in communicative sexuality, he acts either\nout of reckless disregard, or out of willful ignorance. For he cannot\nknow, except through the practice of communicative sexuality, whether\nhis partner has any sexual reason for continuing the encounter. And\nwhere she does not, he runs the risk of imposing on her what she is\nnot willing to have. All that is needed, then, in order to provide\nwomen with legal protection from date rape is to make both reckless\nindifference and willful ignorance a sufficient condition of mens\nrea, and to make communicative sexuality the accepted norm of sex\nto which a reasonable woman would agree. (239\u201340)\n\n\nIn short, if a man does not engage in communicative sexuality, then he\ndoes not really know whether his partner is consenting; thus, if he\nnonetheless believes that she is consenting, then that belief is\nunreasonable.\n\nFinally, some feminists have argued that rape should be a strict\nliability offense, that is, one with no mens rea requirement\nat all. According to MacKinnon, a mens rea requirement means\nthat \u201cthe man\u2019s perceptions of the woman\u2019s desires\ndetermine whether she is deemed violated,\u201d and this approach is\nproblematic because \u201cmen are systematically conditioned not even\nto notice what women want\u201d (1989, 180\u201381). Adopting a\n\u201creasonable belief\u201d standard does not help, in her view,\nbecause the standard for \u201creasonableness\u201d masquerades as\nobjectivity while almost inevitably relying on patriarchal and\npornographic assumptions; thus \u201cmeasuring consent from the\nsocially reasonable, meaning objective man\u2019s, point of view\nreproduces the same problem under a more elevated label\u201d\n(181).\n\nHere MacKinnon speaks to a broader debate in feminist legal theory, in\nwhich some feminists have argued for the adoption of a\n\u201creasonable woman standard\u201d in matters ranging from sexual\nharassment to stalking, battering, and rape. Proponents of this\napproach believe that a gender-neutral standard of reasonableness is\nimpossible given the differences between men\u2019s and women\u2019s\nsocial positioning. They point out, for instance, that men have\ngreater social and (in most cases) physical power than women and,\nrelatedly, that women\u2019s beliefs and reactions are shaped by the\nconstant threat of male violence with which women live (Kerns 2001).\nBecause of these differences, women and men often have divergent\nperceptions of interpersonal behavior (Scheppele 1991, 45): for\ninstance, behavior that men see as merely flirtatious may be\nexperienced by women as offensive or even threatening, and women may\nsee advances as physically intimidating that men see as aggressively\namorous. Proponents thus contend, in the words of Hubin and Haely (who\nreject this approach), that \u201cwhen we seek to determine whether\nthe actions and words of the victim constitute or indicate consent to\nsexual intercourse \u2013 it is the standard of the reasonable\nwoman we must employ\u201d (1999, 119). Thus, for example,\nin assessing the reasonableness of an alleged victim\u2018s judgment\nthat it would be dangerous to resist a particular sexual advance, a\njury would ask whether a reasonable woman in that situation\nwould so judge. Opponents of the reasonable woman standard contend\nthat it is both possible and desirable to account for common\ndifferences between men\u2019s and women\u2019s physiologies, social\nexperiences, and perceptions without importing gender into the\ndefinition of reasonableness itself. For instance, while granting that\na reasonable person standard should often yield different conclusions\nfor men than for women, Hubin and Haely contend that \u201cthis is\nnot because the reasonable person standard fails to present a single\n(gender neutral) standard, but because the standard we are employing\nis sensitive to features of the agent and the situation that are\ncorrelated with gender\u201d (1999, 133).\n2.3 Force\n\nIn many jurisdictions, the law defines the crime of rape as comprising\ntwo separate elements: force and lack of consent. As West observes, in\nsuch jurisdictions\n\nsex that is undeniably forced is, nevertheless, not rape if\nthe victim \u201cconsented\u201d to it; and \u2026 sex that is\nundeniably nonconsensual is, nevertheless, not rape if there was no\nforce used to obtain it. (1996, 233)\n\n\nWest explains that, historically, rape law has seen two kinds of\nforced sex as consensual: first, the sex that a man forces on his wife\n(since she was thought to have \u201cconsented\u201d permanently and\nirrevocably to sex by getting married); and second, submission or\nacquiescence in the face of a show of force and/or a threat of more\nviolence to come. Furthermore, she points out, women are often\nportrayed in both pornographic and mainstream media as enjoying, and\n(the assumption is) therefore consenting to, forceful and even violent\nsex; such assumptions often derail rape cases, as when a defendant\nclaims that the encounter was simply \u201crough sex\u201d that was\nenjoyed by the victim. Underlying the inclusion of a nonconsent\nrequirement over and above the force requirement, according to West,\nis the view that \u201cwomen consent to forced sex all the\ntime\u2014so forced sex alone can\u2019t be rape\u201d (239). Cases\nof nonconsensual but unforced sex, on the other hand, include those in\nwhich the victim is induced to have sex through fraudulent\nmisrepresentation (for instance, a doctor telling her that sex with\nhim is necessary for her cure), and those in which she is coerced\nthrough nonviolent means (for instance, a professor telling her that\nshe must have sex with him to pass the course). The tendency of the\nlaw to see such encounters as meaningfully consensual departs\nstrikingly from how consent is understood in other areas; as West\nobserves, \u201cfraud or coercion that vitiates consent in\nnonsexual contexts constitutes either criminal or tortious\nactivity\u201d (240).\n\nMost feminists see the dual requirement of force and nonconsent as\nredundant at best and, at worst, as defining many rapes out of\nexistence. Feminists differ, however, as to how rape laws should\nideally be structured. Perhaps the most common view is that the force\nrequirement should be eliminated, and rape defined simply as\nnonconsensual sex, with differing degrees of severity depending on\nwhether and how much force and violence are employed (Estrich 1987).\nWhile some state statutes are now written this way, they often build\nphysical force into the definition of non-consent; thus in practice\nthey function very much like the dual requirement of force and\nnon-consent (Anderson 2005a, 630).\n\nAnother alternative is to eliminate the nonconsent requirement,\ndefining rape simply as forced sex. MacKinnon defends a variant of\nthis strategy, contending that \u201cRape should be defined as sex by\ncompulsion, of which physical force is one form. Lack of consent is\nredundant and should not be a separate element of the crime\u201d\n(1989, 245). This approach has the advantage of focusing on what the\nperpetrator did, rather than on how the victim responded (that is, on\nwhether her behavior constituted, or could reasonably have been seen\nby the perpetrator as constituting, consent).\n\nA third approach is to separate the two elements into two separate\ncrimes, one based on the use of force and the other on the lack of\nconsent. McGregor defends this idea, proposing that:\n\nIf either the offender engaged in sexual activity through the use of\nforce or he failed to secure meaningful consent, then [he] has\ncommitted an offense \u2026. Rather than requiring both conditions,\nas the current statutes do, or attempting to pack all cases into one\nor the other of the conjuncts \u2026 this approach recognizes that\nthere are at least two different offenses \u2026 for which there are\ndifferent conditions and different levels of seriousness. (1996, 190)\n\n\nSchulhofer (1998) argues, in a similar vein, that the law should\nrecognize two different offenses: sexual assault, which involves the\nuse of \u201cphysical force to compel another person to submit to an\nact of sexual penetration\u201d (283); and sexual abuse, a lesser\n(though still felonious) crime, which involves sexual penetration\nwithout the other person\u2019s affirmative and freely given consent.\nSome commentators have observed that developing such a lesser offense\nmay aid in winning convictions, as juries are reluctant to convict\nnonviolent offenders of rape. Anderson (2005a) criticizes this\napproach, however, pointing out that survivors of what she calls\n\u201call-American rape\u201d (nonconsensual sex without extrinsic\nforce or violence, usually committed by an acquaintance) suffer trauma\nat least as severe as do survivors of forceful rape. She contends that\n\u201call-American rape\u201d should retain the powerful label (and\npotentially severe penalty) of rape, while rapists who employ violence\nextrinsic to the rape itself should be charged with rape and\nother offenses (such as kidnapping or aggravated assault) as\nappropriate.\n2.4 Other approaches\n\nRecent scholarship includes some novel approaches to the legal\ndefinition of rape. MacKinnon, for instance, has recommended that a\nbroadened understanding of force (as including hierarchies of power)\nshould be supplemented not by a nonconsent requirement, but by a\nstandard of \u201cwelcomeness.\u201d A consent standard, she\nobserves, incorporates gender hierarchy by assuming that men initiate\nsexual contact which women then either accept or refuse, whereas a\nwelcomeness standard suggests the centrality of \u201cchoice,\nmutuality, and desire\u201d (2005, 243). She explains her approach as\nfollows:\n\nThe idea here is not to prohibit sexual contact between hierarchical\nunequals per se but to legally interpret sex that a hierarchical\nsubordinate says was unwanted in the context of the forms of force\nthat animate the hierarchy between the parties. To counter a claim\nthat sex was forced by inequality, a defendant could (among other\ndefenses) prove the sex was wanted\u2014affirmatively and freely\nwanted\u2014despite the inequality, and was not forced by the\nsocially entrenched forms of power that distinguish the parties.\n(247\u201348)\n\n\nMacKinnon also recommends the passage of new, sex-equality-based civil\nrights laws that sexual assault victims can use against their\nattackers. Such laws, in her view, would offer survivors a kind of\ndignity and control that criminal prosecutions often do not, while\nattaching the \u201cstigma of bigotry\u201d to perpetrators\n(248).\n\nAnderson (2005b) urges the elimination of both the force requirement\nand the nonconsent requirement, and the adoption in their place of\nwhat she calls the \u201cnegotiation model.\u201d She contrasts her\napproach with the two most common \u201creform\u201d positions,\nwhich she calls the No Model and the Yes Model. According to the No\nModel, a sexual act is consensual unless the victim says no or resists\nphysically. According to the Yes Model, a sexual act is rape unless\nconsent is affirmatively granted (by verbal or physical behavior).\nAgainst the No Model, Anderson points out that many victims suffer\nperitraumatic paralysis and/or dissociation\u2014that is, conditions\nat the time of trauma that render them unable to protest or resist.\nFurthermore, both the No and Yes models rely heavily on men\u2019s\nability to interpret women\u2019s nonverbal behavior, despite strong\nevidence showing that men routinely fail in this endeavor: the No\nModel, for instance, allows a man to infer consent from a\nwoman\u2019s silence and lack of physical resistance. Finally, both\nmodels in practice tend to assume that a woman\u2019s willing\nparticipation in non-penetrative sexual activity is a reliable\nindicator of her consent to penetration (for instance, Anderson points\nout that according to Schulhofer, an advocate of the Yes Model, a\nwoman\u2019s engaging in heavy sexual petting typically indicates her\naffirmative willingness to have intercourse). This assumption,\nAnderson emphasizes, is not only often untrue but, in the age of AIDS,\nespecially dangerous.\n\nLike MacKinnon, Anderson sees a fundamental problem in the notion of\nsexual consent as \u201ca woman\u2019s passive acquiescence to male\nsexual initiative\u201d (1406). Negotiation, in contrast,\n\u201csuggests not the granting of permission for the actions of\nanother \u2026 but an active consultation with someone else to come\nto a mutual agreement\u201d (1421). The negotiation model thus\nrequires \u201cconsultation, reciprocal communication, and the\nexchange of views before a person initiates sexual penetration\u201d\n(1421). (This requirement of consultation before penetration\ndistinguishes Anderson\u2019s approach from Pineau\u2019s, despite\ntheir shared emphasis on communication; in addition, Pineau\u2019s\nmodel retains an overall consent standard whereas Anderson abandons\nthat standard.) Unless and until a relational context has been\nestablished that enables partners to interpret reliably each\nother\u2019s nonverbal behavior, the negotiation must be verbal. The\nnegotiation model is gender-neutral, requiring that any person who\ninitiates sexual penetration consult verbally with his or her partner\n(of either gender) to come to a mutual understanding of whether both\nparties want penetration to occur. Such communication, Anderson\nobserves, \u201cexpresses an interest in the other person\u2019s\nperspective \u2026 [and] a willingness to consider the other\nperson\u2019s inclinations and humanity. It expresses that the other\nperson matters\u201d (1423). The negotiation model thus differs at\nleast in spirit from even a version of the Yes Model that requires\nverbal consent, in that it emphasizes mutuality rather than a\none-sided permission-seeking.\n\nMart\u00edn Alcoff, having emphasized that the legal system is not\nalways the best, and certainly not the only, arena for reaching truth\nand understanding regarding rape, also suggests that we \u201cmove\naway from simplistic binary categories\u201d (for instance, rape\nversus not-rape) and embrace the broader, more flexible and capacious\nnotion of sexual violation. \u201cTo violate,\u201d she\nobserves,\u201c is to infringe on someone, to transgress, and it can\nalso mean to rupture or break. Violations can happen with stealth,\nwith manipulation, with soft words and a gentle touch to a child, to\nan employee, or anyone who is significantly vulnerable to the offices\nof others\u201d (2018, 12). Among the benefits of this approach, in\nAlcoff\u2019s view, is to make room for the complex experiences of\nsurvivors, who often struggle and/or evolve over time in developing\nand articulating their interpretations of what was done to them. \n\nLegal theorist Jane Kim has argued that \u201crape tolerance\u201d\nin the United States\u2014evidenced by low rates of arrest,\nprosecution, and conviction of rapists at the state\nlevel\u2014indicates a need for new legal approaches (2012, 273). In\nher view, \u201crape should be considered a form of slavery\nprohibited by the Thirteenth Amendment of the Constitution, allowing\nfor the creation of a federal criminal regime to prosecute and\nprioritize rape in conjunction with state regimes\u201d (266). She\nargues that the Thirteenth Amendment was intended to prohibit slavery\nand involuntary servitude in all of its forms, and that neither the\nbrief duration of many rapes nor concerns about a \u201cslippery\nslope\u201d warrant excluding rape from its purview. \u201cIn order\nto construct and prosecute rape in a manner consistent with its\npurported gravity,\u201d Kim contends, \u201crape must be\neffectively prosecuted, prohibited, protected against, and abolished\nunder the Thirteenth Amendment\u201d (267).\n\nIt bears noting that successful rape prosecutions depend not only on\nhow rape is legally defined but, at least equally importantly, on the\ngeneral public\u2019s willingness to believe women\u2019s testimony\n(rather than seeing them as lying or confused) and to recognize\nparticular encounters as instances of the applicable legal definition\n(that is, to see this behavior as force, or this\nutterance as expressing nonconsent). Also posing a challenge to\nsuccessful prosecution is what Estrich calls the \u201cassumption of\nrisk approach to culpability\u201d: the common belief that, as she\nputs it, \u201cwomen who put themselves in compromising positions\nshouldn\u2019t complain when they are compromised\u201d (1992, 10).\nThe continuing prevalence of such rape-supportive beliefs can render\neven well-intentioned prosecutors unwilling to pursue legitimate\ncases, given the likelihood that juries will refuse to convict.\n3. The Wrongs and Harms of Rape\n\nAny legal definition of \u2018rape\u2019 implies some correlative\nidea of what is morally wrong with rape: its illegitimate use of\nforce, its disregard of the victim\u2019s nonconsent, and so on.\nFeminist theorists have often sought to articulate a more richly\ntextured sense of rape\u2019s wrongness, and of its distinctive\nharms, than the law alone can provide. They have thus developed a\nnumber of interpretive frames\u2014ideas about what rape is most\nclosely akin to, and/or a form of\u2014for understanding rape\u2019s\nwrongs and harms. No doubt both the wrong and the harm of rape are\ncomplex and multifarious; these interpretive frames suggest emphases\nthat may be illuminating in different contexts and for different\npurposes.\n3.1 Harms to individual victims\n\nThe view most commonly identified with feminism in popular discourse\nis that rape is a crime of \u201cviolence, not sex\u201d\u2014that\nis, a form of assault whose sexual nature is irrelevant, and which is\nanalogous to other violent crimes. While this view has rarely been\ndefended by feminist philosophers, it has been prominent in some\nfeminist anti-rape public education and activism. (One feminist\ntheorist often claimed to have held this view is Susan Brownmiller\n(1975); see Cahill 2001, 16-28.) Such efforts often seek to challenge\nviews of rape as a \u201ccrime of passion,\u201d motivated by the\nperpetrator\u2019s overwhelming lust (presumably in response to the\nvictim\u2019s sexual attractiveness and/or provocation). Thus, in\naddition to challenging victim-blaming assumptions, feminists often\nemphasized rapists\u2019 non-sexual motivations, such as anger and\nthe desire for dominance and control; on this view, the rapist is a\nviolent criminal like other violent criminals, not just a guy seeking\nsex a bit too vigorously. Similarly, this approach emphasizes that\nrape victims are real crime victims, not vaguely titillating people\nwho had some overly rough sex and might just have liked it.\n\nThe limitations of the \u201cviolence, not sex\u201d approach,\nhowever, are fairly glaring. Rape\u2019s sexual nature is central to\nunderstanding both its perpetrators\u2019 motivations and its effects\non victims, not to mention the crime\u2019s broader social and\nideological roots and consequences. While perpetrators differ in their\nstrongest occurrent motivations, it is important to ask why so many\nmen who wish to harm or violate women do so in a sexual manner.\nFurthermore, some rapes do occur because a man wants to have sex, and\nperhaps would even prefer it if his partner consented, but is prepared\nto proceed without her consent. Rape\u2019s sexual character is\ncentral from the perspective of both actual and potential victims; as\nCahill observes, \u201cfew women would agree that being raped is\nessentially equivalent to being hit in the face\u201d (2001, 3).\nFurthermore, many rape survivors are damaged specifically in their\nsexuality, facing difficulties in their sexual relationships in the\nmonths and years following the rape. Finally, because many rapes do\nnot involve overt extrinsic violence, the \u201cviolence, not\nsex\u201d slogan may make it more difficult for people to recognize\nless obviously violent experiences of sexual force as rape. In short,\nrape is forced, abusive, and/or violent sex; recognizing\nrape\u2019s sexual nature is crucial to understanding not only its\nwrongs and harms, but also the cultural and political meaning of sex\nin patriarchal cultures. As MacKinnon observes, \u201cso long as we\nsay that [rape, sexual harassment, and pornography] are abuses of\nviolence, not sex, we fail to criticize what has been made of sex,\nwhat has been done to us through sex\u201d (1987, 86\u201387).\n\nThe violation of bodily and sexual autonomy is no doubt among\nrape\u2019s most central harms. In their classic discussion, Frye and\nShafer (1977) employ the concept of \u201cdomain\u201d to elaborate\non such violation. A person\u2019s domain\u2014\u201cthe physical,\nemotional, psychological, and intellectual space it lives in\u201d\n(338)\u2014defines the range of matters over which the person has\nrightful power of consent. Because a person\u2019s body is at the\nvery center of her domain and is the locus of the properties and\ncapacities that make her a person, the intentional invasion of the\nbody is an especially egregious attack: \u201cto presume to wield an\neffective power of consent over the personal properties and/or the\nbody of [a] creature \u2026 is ipso facto to deny that there is a\nperson there at all\u201d (340). Thus, rape treats the victim not as\na person but as an object, and one with a purely sexual function. Frye\nand Shafer emphasize that rape\u2019s communication of this message\nconstitutes one significant element of its harm: \u201c[rape] gives\n[the victim] a picture of herself as a being within someone\u2019s\ndomain and not as a being which has domain \u2026. Whether it is the\nrapist\u2019s intention or not, being raped conveys for the woman the\nmessage that she is a being without respect, that she is not a\nperson\u201d (341\u201342). Hampton sounds a similar theme,\ncontending that through its expressive\ncontent\u2014\u201crepresenting the rapist as master and the victim\nas inferior object\u201d\u2014rape does an objective \u201cmoral\ninjury\u201d to its victim\u2019s value (1999, 135). It is not\nsurprising, then, that many rape survivors describe feeling not only\nworthless, but also numb, absent, or deadened. The reaction is\nunderstandable since, as Cahill observes, \u201cRape, in its total\ndenial of the victim\u2019s agency, will, and personhood, can be\nunderstood as a denial of intersubjectivity itself \u2026. The self\nis at once denied and \u2026 stilled, silenced, overcome\u201d\n(2001, 132).\n\nSome recent discussions emphasize that a full account of rape\u2019s\nharm must incorporate both its denial of victims\u2019 personhood and\nits intimate, sexual and bodily nature. According to Cahill,\n\u201crape must be understood fundamentally \u2026 as an affront to\nthe embodied subject \u2026. a sexually specific act that destroys\n(if only temporarily) the intersubjective, embodied agency and\ntherefore personhood of a woman\u201d (2001, 13). Anderson, seeking\nto define rape\u2019s harm based on the \u201clived\nexperience\u201d of those who go through it, cites\n\u201cdehumanization, objectification, and domination\u201d as\nprominent in the accounts of both rapists and rape victims (2005,\n641). Rape, she concludes, is best understood not only as the denial\nof sexual autonomy, but as \u201csexually invasive\ndehumanization\u201d (643).\n\nLinda Mart\u00edn Alcoff, too, emphasizes rape\u2019s specifically\nsexual harm, arguing in particular that sexual violations can be both\nidentified and criticized on the basis of their damage to\nvictims\u2019 sexual subjectivity. Alcoff contends that \u201cAs a\nconcept, sexual subjectivity provides an alternative to the singular\nfocus on the violation of our consent, desire, the capacity for\npleasure, or will . . . our central concern with sexual violations\nshould be their inhibiting and transformative effects on sexual\nsubjectivity or our self-making capacities\u201d (2018, 111). Sexual\nsubjectivity, in her view, includes the capacity for sexual agency,\nbut more broadly amounts to \u201cour concernful making relationship\nto ourselves as sexual subjects\u201d (121). Survivors of sexual\nviolations, Alcoff contends, suffer damage to their ability to develop\nand live out, in a caring, reflective, and flexible way, their own\nsexual selfhood. \u201cWhat is violated,\u201d she writes, \u201cis\nnot a substantive set of normative or normal desires, but the\npractical activity of caring for the self. Trauma atrophies\npossibilities\u201d (145).\n\nThe humiliation and shame often experienced by rape victims are\npredictable results of experiencing total subjugation and the intimate\nloss of control of one\u2019s body. These reactions\u2014not to\nmention victims\u2019 feelings of contamination, of having been\ndefiled or desecrated\u2014are often exacerbated by cultural\njudgments of raped women as dirty and impure, or as \u201cdamaged\ngoods.\u201d In some cultures, these ideas are so powerful that a\nwoman who is raped (or who has consensual illicit sex) is thought to\nbring shame on her entire family; such women sometimes become the\nvictims of so-called \u201chonor killings\u201d at the hands of male\nrelatives (Banerjee 2003, Baxi et al. 2006, Ruggi 1998).\n\nA distinctive set of harms enters the picture when, as is increasingly\ncommon, women and girls are violated while unconscious, often with\npictures or videos taken and circulated. As Kelly Oliver points out,\n\u201clack of consent is valorized within popular culture to the\npoint that sexual assault has become a spectator sport and creepshot\nentertainment on social media \u2026 sex with unconscious girls,\nespecially accompanied by photographs as trophies, has become a goal\nof some boys and men\u201d (2016, 59\u201360). In such cases, Oliver\nobserves, \u201cThe trauma of victimization not only becomes public\nbut also infinitely repeatable. It can go viral. It doesn\u2019t go\naway\u201d (91). Cressida Heyes (2016) provides a phenomenological\naccount of the devastating harms of raping an unconscious victim.\nRaping someone who is unconscious, Heyes contends,\n\nexploits and reinforces a victim\u2019s lack of agency and exposes\nher body in ways that make it especially difficult for her to\nreconstitute herself as a subject. It damages both her ability to\nengage with the world in four dimensions (through a temporally\npersisting body schema) and her ability to retreat from it into\nanonymity \u2026 Sexual assault while unconscious can make the\nrestful anonymity of sleep impossible, leaving only the violent\nexposure of a two-dimensional life. (2016, 365)\n\n\nThe assumption that such rapes are less harmful than the rapes of\nconscious victims--since the rape itself is not directly\nexperienced--is therefore badly mistaken, Heyes argues. The victim of\nunconscious rape, she points out, \u201cstruggles to feel safe\nlapsing into the one form of anonymity that is biologically and\nexistentially necessary for human life, yet ultimately she will have\nno choice but to revisit this place over and over \u2026 no one can\navoid going to sleep for very long\u201d (2016, 379).\n\nMany rapes lead to additional harms beyond those intrinsic to the rape\nitself. Some rapes cause pregnancy or sexually transmitted diseases\n(including HIV infection), and some rapists physically injure their\nvictims. Victims who do not reveal their rapes to others, whether due\nto shame or to the expectation that they will not be believed,\nexperience profound isolation and lack of support; and indeed, many\nwho do report their rapes are disbelieved or blamed by friends,\nfamily, and/or police. Even those survivors who are believed too often\nface, as Alcoff points out, a kind of \u201cpreemptive\ndisauthorization or assumption that [they] are incapable of measured\nand thoughtful analysis\u201d (2018, 50). Due to both low reporting\nlevels and low conviction rates, relatively few victims see their\nrapists punished; many of those raped by relatives, co-workers,\nfriends, or other ongoing acquaintances must then face continuing\ninteraction with the rapist, while those raped by strangers often fear\nthat the rapist will find and re-victimize them.\n\nWith or without these additional harms (but especially with them),\nrape constitutes severe trauma. Undergoing trauma shatters the\nvictim\u2019s most basic assumptions about herself and her safety in\nthe world. According to Brison, who survived a violent rape and\nattempted murder, trauma\n\nintroduces a \u201csurd\u201d\u2014a nonsensical entry\u2014into\nthe series of events in one\u2019s life, making it seem impossible to\ncarry on with the series \u2026 . Not only is it now impossible to\ncarry on with the series, but whatever sense had been made of it in\nthe past has been destroyed. The result is an uneasy paralysis. I\ncan\u2019t go, I can\u2019t stay. All that is left is the\npresent, but one that has no meaning, or has, at most, only the\nshifting sense of a floating indexical, the dot of a \u201cnow\u201d\nthat would go for a walk, if only it knew where to go. (2002,\n103\u2013104)\n\n\nWith its profound effects on social connection, cognition, memory, and\nemotion, trauma disrupts the continuity of the self. It is strikingly\ncommon for a trauma survivor to feel that she is not the same person\nshe was prior to the trauma, and even that at least a part of her has\ndied; as Brison puts it, \u201cI felt as if I was experiencing things\nposthumously \u2026 as though I\u2019d somehow outlived\nmyself\u201d (8\u20139). To reconstitute the self in a new form, the\nsurvivor must construct a meaningful narrative that incorporates the\ntrauma, but many survivors face obstacles in this endeavor such as\ndisordered cognition, memory gaps, feelings of despair and futility,\nand the lack of an audience willing to hear, believe, and understand\ntheir story. Such isolation is exacerbated when the trauma was humanly\ninflicted (as with rape), since such assaults, as Brison puts it,\n\u201c[sever] the sustaining connection between the self and the rest\nof humanity\u201d (40). Brison\u2019s own account emphasizes the\n\u201cextent to which the self is created and sustained by others\nand, thus, is able to be destroyed by them\u201d (62); this\nrelational element is central both to trauma itself and to any\npossible recovery. Because \u201cviolent intrusions by others\n\u2026 severely impair our ability to be connected to humanity in\nways we value\u201d (61), recovery requires slowly repairing\nconnections\u2014both to others and to damaged parts of\noneself\u2014and rebuilding a sense of trust (again, of both oneself\nand others).\n\nFor many women, rape is not a one-time event; rather sexual violence\nand exploitation are, for at least some period of time, routine\nconditions of their lives. Such women experience female sexual\nslavery, defined by Barry as any situation in which\n\nwomen or girls cannot change the immediate conditions of their\nexistence; where regardless of how they got into those conditions they\ncannot get out; and where they are subject to sexual violence and\nexploitation. (1984, 40)\n\n\nAs Barry observes, such situations include battering relationships,\nmost prostitution, and the sexual abuse of girl children, all of which\nare common around the world. It is thus important to consider the\ndistinctive effects of such repeated and routine sexual trauma. Herman\nhas recommended the adoption of a new diagnosis, complex\npost-traumatic stress disorder, to describe accurately the\npsychological impact of \u201cprolonged, repeated trauma\u201d\n(1997, 119). (This diagnosis is intended to encompass various forms of\nhumanly inflicted trauma, not only sexual trauma.) The damage of such\nprolonged trauma to a victim\u2019s personality may be so severe as\nto constitute what Frye has called mayhem: a psychic\n\u201cmaiming\u201d in which the exploiter instills in his victim\nsuch a grossly distorted perspective on herself, her function, and her\nworth that she becomes (whether temporarily or permanently) unable to\nidentify or pursue her own interests, assert her rights, or defend\nherself against further aggression (1983, 70).\n3.2 Harms to women as a group\n\nRape is unquestionably a gendered crime: 91% of rape victims are\nfemale, while almost 99% of perpetrators are male (Greenfield 1997).\nIn light both of these numbers and of rape\u2019s broader ideological\ndynamics and social consequences, feminists have long contended that\nrape harms not only its individual victims, but also women as a class.\nBrison, for instance, calls rape \u201cgender-motivated violence\nagainst women, which is perpetrated against women collectively, albeit\nnot all at once and in the same place\u201d (2002, 98). Understanding\nhow rape harms women as a group requires analyzing it not only as an\nindividual act but also as an institution\u2014that is, a structured\nsocial practice with distinct positions and roles, and with (explicit\nor implicit) rules that define who may (or must) do what under what\ncircumstances (Card 1991). Feminists have highlighted the ways in\nwhich the institution of rape reinforces the group-based subordination\nof women to men: for instance, by making women fearful, and by\nenforcing patriarchal dictates both about proper female behavior and\nabout the conditions of male sexual entitlement to women\u2019s\nbodies. As Burgess-Jackson puts it, \u201cRape\u2014the act and the\npractice\u2014subjugates an entire class of individuals (women) to\nanother (men) \u2026. every woman, qua woman, is wronged by\nit\u201d (2000, 289).\n\nFeminists have long claimed that, in patriarchal cultures, rape is not\nanomalous but paradigmatic\u2014that it enacts and reinforces, rather\nthan contradicting, widely shared cultural views about gender and\nsexuality. As Dworkin puts it, \u201crape is not committed by\npsychopaths or deviants from our social norms\u2014rape is committed\nby exemplars of our social norms \u2026. Rape is no excess,\nno aberration, no accident, no mistake\u2014it embodies sexuality as\nthe culture defines it\u201d (1976, 45\u201346). A core dynamic of\npatriarchal sexuality, on this view, is the normalizing and\nsexualizing of male (or masculine) control and dominance over females\n(or the feminine). This dynamic finds expression in a number of\nbeliefs about what is natural, acceptable, and even desirable in\nmale-female sexual interaction: that the male will be persistent and\naggressive, the female often reluctant and passive; that the male is\ninvulnerable, powerful, hard, and commanding, and that women desire\nsuch behavior from men; that \u201creal men\u201d are able to get\nsexual access to women when, where, and how they want it; that sexual\nintercourse is an act of male conquest; that women are men\u2019s\nsexual objects or possessions; and that men \u201cneed\u201d and are\nentitled to sex.\n\nOne study of undetected, self-reported acquaintance rapists found that\nthese individuals\u2019 propensity to rape was significantly related\nnot only to their acceptance of rape myths and of traditional ideas\nabout male and female sexuality, but also to their belief that male\nsexual aggression is normal (Hinck and Thomas 1999, 816). Such beliefs\nhave repeatedly been shown to play a role not only in men\u2019s\nself-reported likelihood of committing rape, but also in\npeople\u2019s tendency to define rape more restrictively, and to\nattribute responsibility and blame to rape victims (1999, 816). (The\ninfluence of rape myths on people\u2019s definitions of rape explains\nwhy most men who report engaging in \u201csexually assaultive,\nabusive, or coercive behavior in order to procure sexual\nintercourse\u201d (1999, 816) do not define their own behavior as\nrape.) Feminists have coined the term \u2018rape culture\u2019 to\ndescribe the pervasiveness and acceptability of rape-supportive\nmessages in media and popular discourse. Some have further contended\nthat many rapes, being at least partially motivated by group-based\nanimus as expressed in rape-supportive beliefs, should be categorized\nas hate crimes (Wellman 2006).\n\nOn this view, rape is a political practice by which spurious beliefs\nabout gender and sexuality are expressed, inscribed, and enforced via\nthe violation and control of women\u2019s bodies. Hampton thus claims\nthat \u201crape as it occurs in our society \u2026 is a moral\ninjury to all women \u2026 insofar as it is part of a pattern of\nresponse of many men toward many women that aims to establish their\nmastery qua male over a woman qua female \u2026.\nRape confirms that women are \u2018for\u2019 men: to be used,\ndominated, treated as objects\u201d (1999, 135). This underlying\ngender ideology helps to explain why, when men and boys are raped\n(almost always by other males), they are often seen as having been\nfeminized, treated like women and thus rendered shamefully\nwoman-like.\n\nMany feminists have emphasized the role of rape in controlling\nwomen\u2019s behavior through fear. Dworkin contends that, due to the\nthreat of rape, \u201call women live in constant jeopardy, in a\nvirtual state of siege\u201d (1976, 37); and several feminists have\ndrawn analogies between rape and lynching as forms of terrorizing,\ngroup-based social control (Burgess-Jackson 2000, 286-88). Card argues\nthat rape is a terrorist institution, one which\u2014despite its\nadmitted differences from acts more normally labeled terrorism, such\nas bombing and hijacking\u2014advances its political purpose, the\ncontinued subordination of women, by terrorizing a target population\n(1991). Like all terrorism, she contends, rape has two targets: the\ndirect victims, who are seen as expendable, and the broader population\nto whom a message is sent, and who can then be manipulated by fear\ninto complying with demands they would otherwise reject. In response\nto the threat of rape, women scrutinize and restrict their own\nchoices\u2014what they wear, where they go and with whom, whether\nthey drink, what \u201cmessages\u201d they may be inadvertently\nsending men, and so on\u2014to ensure that they are following the\nunwritten rules that govern female behavior and that (supposedly)\ndistinguish the bad girls who get raped from the good girls who do\nnot. Even women who, because of their conformity to these rules, do\nnot feel afraid of being raped have nonetheless, Card points out, been\nterrorized into compliance.\n\nA central element of rape as a terrorist institution, Card claims, is\na protection racket in which men, as the group both creating the\ndanger and proposing to deliver women from it, dole out\nprotection\u2014sometimes temporary, sometimes permanent, often\nillusory\u2014in exchange for women\u2019s service, loyalty, and\ncompliance. In this system, \u201cgood\u201d men protect virtuous\nand deserving women from \u201cbad\u201d men, and part of what\ndefines a woman as deserving protection is her conformity to rules of\npatriarchal femininity. Women who are not offered protection, or who\ndecline it when offered, are then frequently blamed for being raped.\nFurthermore, as Card points out, the rules of the institution often\ngrant \u201cprotectors\u201d\u2014whether husbands, boyfriends, or\npimps\u2014sexual access to the woman or women whom they protect, so\nthat nothing they do to those women is taken to count as rape. The\ninstitution thus requires a woman to give up her sexual autonomy in\nrelation to one man, in order to gain his (conditional and unreliable)\n\u201cprotection\u201d from other men.\n\nThe threat of rape, with its false promise that by being\n\u201cgood\u201d we can avoid disaster, plays an important role in\ntraining women in the requirements of femininity. Describing a\n\u201cfeminine bodily comportment that is marked by fear,\u201d\nCahill observes that the female body well-trained in femininity\n\u201cis that of a pre-victim\u201d (2001, 157). The feminine body\nis marked by hesitancy, relative weakness, delicacy, and\nrestraint\u2014qualities that in fact render women more vulnerable to\nviolence\u2014and yet the woman or girl is taught to view her sexual\nbody as dangerously provocative because inherently\n\u201crapable\u201d (159). Hence her duty to control, conceal, and\nmonitor her body and its movements, so as not to bring disaster upon\nherself. \u201cThe socially produced feminine body,\u201d Cahill\nclaims, \u201cis the body of the guilty pre-victim \u2026.\nshe was somewhere she should not have been, moving her body in ways\nshe should not have, carrying on in a manner so free and easy as to\nconvey an utter abandonment of her responsibilities of self-protection\nand self-surveillance\u201d (160). By molding women both to\nfemininity and to self-blame, the threat of rape thus systematically\nundermines women\u2019s capacity to resist not only rape itself, but\nvarious other elements of their oppression as well. The threat is so\npervasive in the cultural environment that, according to Brison, girls\n\u201center womanhood freighted with postmemories of sexual\nviolence\u201d (2002,\n 87)[1],\n and years of peremptory warnings and cautionary tales lead many\nvictims to experience rape as \u201ca threat fulfilled\u201d (Cahill\n2001, 164).\n\nMany feminists contend that even as the institution of rape\nsystematically disadvantages women, it benefits men as a class by\nunderwriting beliefs about the naturalness of male dominance, defining\nwomen of certain kinds or in certain circumstances as \u201cfair\ngame,\u201d rendering women dependent on and thus beholden to men for\nprotection, and giving men a competitive advantage by restricting\nwomen\u2019s freedom of action and movement. May and Strikwerda\ncontend that \u201cjust as the benefit to men distributes throughout\nthe male population in a given society, so the responsibility (for\nrape) should distribute as well\u201d (1994, 148); in their view, men\nas a group bear collective responsibility for rape. Rape\u2019s role\nin increasing the burden of fear in women\u2019s and girls\u2019\nlives leads Burgess-Jackson to highlight it as an issue of\ndistributive justice (1996, 181-205). He contends that the\nstate\u2019s obligation to advance justice requires that it take\nsteps to redistribute fear so that women no longer bear it as an\nunfair and disproportionate burden; furthermore, he claims, since men\nas a class are overwhelmingly the cause of women\u2019s fear, most or\nall of the costs of such redistribution should be borne by men.\n3.3 Rape and racism\n\nRape is a tool not only of patriarchy, but also of racism,\ncolonialism, nationalism, and other pernicious hierarchies. These and\nother power relationships in turn make women and girls even more\nvulnerable to rape. In virtually any situation where women and girls\nbelonging to especially desperate or powerless populations are at the\nmercy of men in authority\u2014from female inmates and girls in\nfoster care, to undocumented immigrants, to refugees dependent on U.N.\npeacekeepers and/or humanitarian aid workers for survival\u2014some\nof those men use their authority to force or extort sexual access.\n\nIn the United States, the racial dynamics of rape are shaped by a long\nhistory of white men raping their African-American female slaves.\nBecause the women were chattel property, the owners (and often\noverseers) could and did use them sexually at will, with complete\nlegal and social impunity. Because children born of slave mothers were\nslaves, regardless of their paternity, many slave owners benefited\nfrom rape by producing more slaves for themselves. Roberts emphasizes,\nhowever, that\n\nthe rape of slave women by their masters was primarily a weapon of\nterror that reinforced whites\u2019 domination over their human\nproperty. Rape was an act of physical violence designed to stifle\nBlack women\u2019s will to resist and to remind them of their servile\nstatus \u2026 . Whites\u2019 sexual exploitation of their slaves,\ntherefore, should not be viewed simply as either a method of\nslave-breeding or the fulfillment of slaveholders\u2019 sexual urges.\n(1997, 29-30)\n\n\nSlaves were frequently forced into undesired sexual liaisons with each\nother as well, based on the whims or the breeding plans of their\nowners. Ultimately, as Collins observes, \u201cBlack women as a class\nemerged from slavery as collective rape victims\u201d (2005, 223),\nand the rape of black women, like the lynching of black men, was a\ncenterpiece of Klan activity post-Emancipation. Collins points out,\nhowever, that unlike lynching, black women\u2019s sexual abuse by\nwhite men during and after slavery did not become a central or\nuniversally understood icon of American racism. The legacy of slavery\nand its attendant ideologies has meant that, both legally and\nsocially, \u201cfor most of American history the crime of rape of a\nBlack woman did not exist\u201d (Roberts 1997, 31).\n\nBlack women\u2019s unrapeability was not only written into law, but\nreinforced by a racial ideology that defined them as lascivious and\npromiscuous by nature. This same racial ideology stereotyped black men\nas savagely oversexed and thus sexually dangerous, especially to white\nwomen. The post-Civil War terror campaign of lynching, which continued\nthrough the 1930\u2019s, was frequently claimed to be punishment for\nblack men who had raped white women, although in fact only a minority\nof lynching victims were even accused of having done any such thing\n(Hall 1983, 334; Davis 1981, 189), and of those, many had in fact had\nconsensual relationships with white women (Hall 1983, 340). The racist\nassociation of rape with black men rendered rape by white men\ncomparatively invisible, thus making white men as a group\nunaccountable for rape (Davis 1981, 199), a dynamic that continued\nwell into the 20th century (Dorr 2008).\n\nThese destructive racial stereotypes remain powerful today, exerting\ninfluence on people\u2019s judgments of whether a rape has occurred,\nhow serious an offense it is, and who is to blame (Foley et al. 1995;\nDonovan and Williams 2002; George and Martinez 2002). Popular culture\nplays an important role in conveying and legitimizing these\nstereotypes. For instance, the image of sexually savage and\nanimalistic black masculinity is a central trope of the popular\n\u201cinterracial\u201d genre of pornography, marketed to white men,\nin which black men are often depicted as damaging white women\u2019s\nbodies with their unusually large penises (Dines 1998, 2006). As\nCollins observes, \u201cmovies, films, music videos, and other mass\nmedia spectacles that depict Black men as violent and that punish them\nfor it have replaced the historical spectacles provided by live,\npublic lynchings\u201d (2005, 242).\n\nThe stereotype of black women as sexually deviant and aggressive\n\u201cJezebels\u201d finds one contemporary reflection in the\n\u201choochie\u201d image, which is increasingly prominent in black\nas well as white cultural and media venues (Collins 2000,\n81\u201384). One study, designed in part to measure the influence of\nthe Jezebel stereotype on young black women\u2019s perceptions of\ntheir own rapes, found that the \u201cstereotype of Black women as\nsexually loose appeared to be internalized by Black participants and\nidentified as an important reason why they were raped\u201d (Neville\net al. 2004, 91). Another researcher, having found that the\nAfrican-American women in her study were less likely than white women\nto have disclosed their rapes (Wyatt 1992, 86), attributes this\ndifference in part to the fact that \u201cAfrican American women\n\u2026. do not anticipate that they will be protected by traditional\nauthorities and institutions\u201d (88). Meanwhile, both the\nstereotypes of black women and their structural vulnerabilities\ncontribute to a situation in which, for too many, sexual abuse is a\nroutine condition of life: \u201cbeing routinely disbelieved by those\nwho control the definitions of violence, encountering mass media\nrepresentations that depict Black women as \u2018bitches,\u2019\n\u2018hoes,\u2019 and other controlling images, and/or experiencing\ndaily assaults such as having their breasts and buttocks fondled by\nfriends and perfect strangers \u2026 may become so routine that\nAfrican American women cannot perceive their own pain\u201d (Collins\n2005, 229).\n\nBlack women who have been raped by black men are sometimes silenced,\neither in order to maintain their own hard-won image as\n\u201crespectable\u201d or to avoid further tarnishing the public\nimage of black manhood. They may be penalized or shunned by their\nfamilies and communities for speaking out, and thus cut off from\nimportant sources of support (Collins 2005, 226-27).\n\nRacist ideologies about rape are also prominent in the history of\ncolonialism and genocide against Native Americans. Ideas about Native\nmen as savage rapists, Native women as downtrodden and raped squaws,\nand white men as heroic saviors of both white and Native women were\nessential to the \u201ccolonial imagination\u201d that explained and\njustified the taking of Native lands (Smith 2005, 7\u201333). These\nideas were conveyed in widely read captivity narratives,\nstories\u2014usually apocryphal, and often written by white\nmen\u2014of the abduction and brutal treatment of a white woman by\nthe \u201csavages\u201d (Smith 2005, 21\u201322; Faludi 2007,\n200\u2013279). The message was that white women desperately needed\nwhite men\u2019s protection, not only in the usual form of\nrestrictions on the women\u2019s behavior and mobility, but also by\nthe men\u2019s efforts to control and kill off dangerous natives. As\nfor supposedly downtrodden Native women, white men proposed to deliver\nthem from their oppression by civilizing them, assimilating them to\nmore enlightened European values and culture. In short, the ideology\nheld that \u201cNative women can only be free while under the\ndominion of white men, and both Native and white women have to be\nprotected from Indian men, rather than from white men\u201d (Smith,\n23). In fact, the reality was quite the contrary. Smith argues that\nrape was a key method of forcibly instituting patriarchal values in\nwhat had been relatively egalitarian Native cultures:\n\nIn order to colonize a people whose society was not hierarchical,\ncolonizers must first naturalize hierarchy through instituting\npatriarchy. Patriarchal gender violence is the process by which\ncolonizers inscribe hierarchy and domination on the bodies of the\ncolonized. (23)\n\n\nHistory bears out Smith\u2019s claim, as white men routinely raped\nand brutalized Native people\u2014first as prisoners and in massacres\n(Smith 2005, 7\u201323), and later in epidemic levels of sexual abuse\nof Native children in white-run boarding schools (Smith 2006).\n3.4 War rape and genocidal rape\n\nRape is a common, indeed arguably universal, form of abuse in war. It\ntakes many forms, including the mass rape of female civilians as\nrecreation and/or as a prize for military victory, the mass rape of\nfemale civilians as a strategy or weapon of war, and the enslavement\nof women and girls to provide sexual service for soldiers and\nofficers. The latter is frequently practiced both by official armies\n(as in the enslavement of mostly Korean and Chinese women and girls by\nJapanese forces during World War II) and by rebel militias (as in the\nabduction of women and girls as \u201cbush wives\u201d for rebels in\nSierra Leone). Additionally, as more women enter military forces, the\nrape of military women by their own male colleagues is an increasingly\nreported abuse (Jeffreys 2007).\n\nSeifert criticizes the common view of rape as simply a regrettable\nbyproduct of wartime social breakdown and lack of military discipline\n(as well as of naturally aggressive male sexuality), contending that,\nin fact, rape is a routine element of military strategy, aimed at\nundermining the will, morale, cohesion, and self-conception of the\nenemy population. She observes that, during wartime,\n\nthe women are those who hold the families and communities together.\nTheir physical and emotional destruction aims at destroying social and\ncultural stability \u2026. in many cultures [the female body]\nembodies the nation as a whole \u2026. The rape of women of a\ncommunity, culture, or nation can be regarded \u2026 as a symbolic\nrape of the body of that community. (1996, 39)\n\n\nIt is thus not surprising that rape in war often involves heightened\nsadism, as well as additional abuses such as forcing men to watch the\nrape of their wives or daughters and forcing women to engage in sex\nwith their own sons, brothers, or other family members. In these and\nother cases, according to MacKinnon, the rape of female civilians is\noften \u201ca humiliation rite for the men on the other side who\ncannot (in masculinity\u2019s terms) \u2018protect\u2019 their\nwomen. Many of these acts make women\u2019s bodies into a medium of\nmen\u2019s expression, the means through which one group of men says\nwhat it wants to say to another\u201d (2006, 223).\n\nBecause rape in war frequently seeks to undermine and destroy bonds of\nfamily, community, and culture, there are important points of\nconnection between rape in war and genocidal rape (Nenadic 2011).\nGenocide is the attempt to destroy a racial, ethnic, religious, or\nnational group as such, in whole or in part, by committing any of a\nnumber of acts against the group\u2019s members; the acts include not\nonly killing, but also causing serious bodily or mental harm, creating\nconditions of life intended to destroy the group physically, and\nimposing restrictions intended to prevent births within the group.\nWhen such acts are committed with genocidal intent, the victim is not\nonly the individual targeted, but the group itself. As Sarah Clark\nMiller observes, rape is an extraordinarily effective genocidal\nstrategy, since it \u201ccorrupts women\u2019s roles as caretakers\nof relationships, conveyors of cultural practices, and sustainers of\nmeaning \u2026 . In these ways, genocidal rapists twist the way in\nwhich women are pivotal to the life of a community, rendering them\npivotal to its destruction\u201d (Miller 2009, 513\u2013514).\n\nGenocidal rape has been recognized and condemned by both the\nInternational Criminal Tribunal for Rwanda (ICTR) and the\nInternational Criminal Tribunal for the Former Yugoslavia (ICTY)\n(Askin 2003, Nenadic 2011). In both cases, rape was employed\nsystematically against the women of a certain group, as part of an\norganized campaign to destroy that group. In Rwanda, the\ninterahamwe raped hundreds of thousands of women and girls\nbelonging to the Tutsi ethnic group, as part of an effort to\nexterminate the Tutsi people entirely. MacKinnon describes the\ngenocidal rape of Muslim and Croatian women in Bosnia-Herzegovina\nas\n\nethnic rape as an official policy of war in a genocidal campaign for\npolitical control \u2026. It is specifically rape under orders\n\u2026. It is also rape unto death, rape as massacre, rape to kill\nand to make the victims wish they were dead. It is rape as an\ninstrument of forced exile, rape to make you leave your home and never\nwant to go back \u2026. It is rape to drive a wedge through a\ncommunity, to shatter a society, to destroy a people. (2006, 187)\n\n\nThe Serbian mass rape campaign was distinguished not only by its\nextraordinary brutality and notorious \u201crape camps,\u201d but\nalso by the systematic forced impregnation of Muslim and Croatian\nwomen and girls. The aim was to claim and colonize the women\u2019s\nbodies reproductively as well as sexually, while increasing the\npopulation of children identified as Serb: \u201cCroatian and Muslim\nwomen [were] being raped, and then denied abortions, to help make a\nSerbian state by making what the perpetrators imagine[d] as Serb\nbabies\u201d (MacKinnon 2006, 188). Goodhart points out that in such\nforced impregnation, the soldiers\u2019 (and their commanders\u2019)\nhope is to \u201ccreate a baby (a son) who will infiltrate,\nundermine, or destroy the mother\u2019s group\u201d (2007, 309). The\nresulting children are in fact seen by the maternal community as\n\u201cchildren of the enemy \u2026 a sort of nascent fifth column\nwithin an already victimized community\u201d (310) and are thus often\nstigmatized, mistreated, or abandoned. Goodhart argues that the\nrapist-fathers have violated the rights not only of the women they\nrape, but also of the children thereby produced. The rapists are\nguilty of wrongful procreation, a \u201cdeliberate, malicious, and\nsadistic\u201d use of procreative power with the intent of creating a\nchild who is unlikely to be able to enjoy his or her human rights\n(317-18).\n\nSome have puzzled over how war rape aimed at enforced pregnancy and\nbirth can be genocidal, since it aims to produce rather than prevent\nbirths within the targeted population. In the case of mass rapes in\nBosnia, some Serb perpetrators may have believed they were producing\n\u201clittle Chetniks [Serbs].\u201d But Claudia Card points out\nthat such a belief, even if sincerely held, does not provide good\ngrounds for regarding these rapes as genocidal, since \u201cin terms\nof biological parentage, the child will be as much non-Serb as Serb,\nand the child\u2019s culture will almost certainly not be\nSerbian\u201d (2008, 184). Thus, she seeks to explain the genocidal\nnature of rape aimed at enforced pregnancy without appealing to\nperpetrators\u2019 beliefs about the ethnic identity of any resulting\nchildren. A better explanation, in her view, emphasizes that the\nSerbian campaign of forced impregnation \u201cimposed a social death\non its victims \u2026 it turned them into living (and gestating)\ncorpses. \u2026 Whether the perpetrators thought they were producing\nlittle Serbs is irrelevant. What counts is the attack on the social\nmeanings of the lives of the women they tortured\u201d (185). Card\nalso develops and expands Beverly Allen\u2019s proposal (1996) that\nmilitary rape aimed at enforced pregnancy employs sperm as a weapon of\nbiological warfare. Such attacks meet the criteria for biological\nwarfare found in international documents, she points out, since\n\na product of a living organism (the rapist) is used to attack a\nbiological system (the reproductive system) in members of the enemy\npopulation. Although this attack need not produce illness, it is\ndesigned to produce social chaos \u2026 . Sperm so used becomes a\nsocial and psychological toxin, poisoning the futures of victims and\ntheir communities by producing children who, if they survive, will\nremind whoever raised them of their traumatic origins in torture.\n\u2026 Unlike bacteria and viruses, sperm is easily containable,\nstorable, preservable, and deliverable by means of men\u2019s bodies.\n(187)\n\n\nSchott takes a different approach to explaining the genocidal nature\nof military rape aimed at enforced pregnancy, drawing centrally on\nHannah Arendt\u2019s concept of natality. War rape aimed at forced\nimpregnation, Schott observes, \u201c[transforms] birth into a weapon\nof death. This is so for women who are raped, who lose a sense of\nbeing at home in their own bodies and of having a future, and it is so\nfor the children born of forced maternity, who may suffer expulsion\nfrom the mother\u2019s community\u201d (2011, 14). Thus such rape\nundermines natality, or the capacity for new beginnings, which Arendt\nregarded as fundamental to human political life. Thus, Schott\ncontends, \u201cwar rape can be understood not only as a tool for the\nunmaking of the social and cultural world, but also a tool for the\nunmaking of the political world\u201d (2009, 86).\n\nRape is used as an instrument of genocide because it is extremely\neffective in doing what genocides do: destroying not only individual\ngroup members, but \u201cthat aspect of the group whole that is more\nthan the sum of its individual parts \u2026 the substance and glue\nof community that lives on when individual members die\u201d\n(MacKinnon 2006, 225). This is especially true when the rapes leave\nchildren motherless, the victims with AIDS, other diseases,\ninfertility, fistulas, and/or other internal injuries, and families\nbroken as victims are abandoned and shunned by their husbands or other\nrelatives. Even absent these additional harms, however, sexual assault\nmay be especially well suited to creating a kind of self-annihilating\nshame in its victims, a shame that can focus on one\u2019s group\nidentity. MacKinnon points out that\n\nsexual atrocities can reasonably produce revulsion to the identity\nthat marked the person for the intimate violation, making the raped\nwant to abandon who they are forever. When the shared identity for\nwhich one is raped is ruined, shattered in oneself and relationally\nbetween oneself and others, the group quality of the group so defined\nis destroyed. (229)\n\n\nSmith underlines this point, and its special applicability to\ngenocidal contexts, observing that \u201cin my experience as a rape\ncrisis counselor, every Native survivor I ever counseled said to me at\none point, \u2018I wish I was no longer Indian\u2019\u201d (2005,\n8).\n\nIn February 2001, the ICTY found three Serbian soldiers guilty of rape\nas a crime against humanity. Crimes against humanity are certain\nextraordinarily inhumane acts (including murder, torture, enslavement,\nand deportation) when those acts are systematically committed against\ncivilian populations in the course of armed conflict. The ICTY\njudgment marked international humanitarian law\u2019s first official\nrecognition of rape as a crime against humanity. According to\nCampbell,\n\nthe axiological foundation of the crime against humanity \u2026 lies\nin a conception of a fundamental trauma to a social body, which\nconsists of the denial of the humanity of others. This model of rape\nas a crime against humanity therefore involves not only a physical and\npsychic trauma to the subject but also a symbolic trauma to\n\u201chumanity.\u201d (2003, 510)\n\n\nThe ICTY verdict thus conveyed a judgment that the Serbian\nperpetrators of mass rape, in addition to violating their individual\nvictims and damaging the cultural and religious groups to which those\nvictims belonged, also insulted and injured humanity as such. Debra\nBergoffen (2012) points out that, in addition, the ICTY verdict\ncreated a new human right to sexual self-determination--a right\ngrounded neither in the agency of an autonomous and inviolable subject\n(implicitly gendered male) nor in an assumed feminine weakness needing\nmale protection, but rather in the dignity of a humanly shared\nvulnerability.\n4. Conclusion\n\nFeminist theorizing about rape draws on a rich tradition of feminist\nscholarship in many disciplines, as well as on women\u2019s insights\ninto their own rape experiences and on the knowledge gained through\ndecades of feminist anti-violence activism. As such theorizing\ncontinues to develop\u2014growing both more radical in its challenges\nto patriarchal social and sexual assumptions, and more global and\n intersectional[2]\n in its analysis\u2014it constitutes an essential support for\nfeminist movements against sexual violence.\n", "bibliography": {"categories": ["<a name=\"WorCit\">Works Cited</a>", "<a name=\"OthImpWor\">Other Important Works</a>"], "cat_ref_text": {"<a name=\"WorCit\">Works Cited</a>": ["</h3>\n<ul class=\"hanging\">", "Alcoff, L.
