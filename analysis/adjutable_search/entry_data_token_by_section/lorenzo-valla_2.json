Valla\u2019s \u201cReform\u201d of Aristotelian Logic\n\nAfter Valla\u2019s attack on what he calls the fundamenta\n(foundations) of Aristotelian-scholastic metaphysics and natural\nphilosophy, he turns to dialectic in Books II and III of his\nRepastinatio. For Valla, argumentation should be approached\nfrom an oratorical rather than a logical point of view. What counts is\nwhether an argument works, which means whether it convinces\none\u2019s adversary or public. The form of the argument is less\nimportant. Dialectic is a species of confirmation and refutation; and,\nas such, it is merely a component of invention, one of the five parts\nof rhetoric (Repastinatio, 1:175; 2:447; DD 2:3).\nCompared to rhetoric, dialectic is an easy subject and does not\nrequire much time to master, since it considers and uses only the\nsyllogism \u201cbare\u201d, as Valla puts it, that is, in isolation\nfrom its wider argumentative context; its sole aim is to teach. The\nrhetorician, on the other hand, uses not only the syllogism, but also\nthe enthymeme (incomplete syllogism), epicheireme (a kind of extended\nreasoning) and example. The orator has to clothe everything in\npersuasive arguments, since his task is not only to teach but also to\nplease and to move. This leads Valla to downplay the importance of the\nAristotelian syllogism and to consider forms of argumentation that are\nnot easily forced into its straightjacket. Among these are captious\nforms of reasoning such as the dilemma, paradox, and heap argument\n(sorites), and Valla offers an interesting analysis of these\nforms in the last book of the Repastinatio.\n\nWithout rejecting the syllogism tout court, Valla is scathing\nabout its usefulness. He regards it as an artificial type of\nreasoning, unfit to be employed by orators since it is does not\nreflect the natural way of speaking and arguing. What is the use, for\nexample, of concluding that Socrates is an animal if one has already\nstated that every man is an animal and that Socrates is a man? It is a\nsimple, puerile, and pedantic affair, hardly amounting to a real\nars (art). Valla\u2019s treatment of the syllogism clearly\nshows his oratorical perspective. Following Quintilian, he stresses\nthat the nature of syllogistic reasoning is to establish proof. One of\nthe two premises contains what is to be proven (que\nprobatur), and the other offers the proof (que probat),\nwhile the conclusion gives the result of the proof\u2014into which\nthe proof \u201cgoes down\u201d (in quam probatio\ndescendit). It is not always necessary, therefore, to have a\nfixed order (major, minor, conclusion). If it suits the occasion\nbetter, we can just as well begin with the minor, or even with the\nconclusion. The order is merely a matter of convention and custom\n(Repastinatio, 1:282\u2013286; 2:531\u2013534; DD\n2:216\u201339).\n\nThese complaints about the artificiality of the syllogism inform\nValla\u2019s discussion of the three figures of the syllogism.\nAristotle had proven the validity of the moods of Figure 2 and 3 by\nconverting them to four moods of Figure 1; and this was taught, for\nexample, by Peter of Spain (thirteenth century) in his widely read\nhandbook on logic, the Summulae logicales, certainly\nconsulted by Valla here. Valla regards this whole business of\nconverting terms and transposing propositions in order to reduce a\nparticular syllogism to one of these four moods of Figure 1 as useless\nand absurd. While he does not question the validity of these four\nmoods, he believes that there are many deviant syllogisms that are\nalso valid, for instance: God is in every place; Tartarus is a place;\ntherefore, God is in Tartarus. Here the \u201cevery\u201d or\n\u201call\u201d sign is added to the predicate in the major\nproposition. He says, moreover, that an entirely singular syllogism\ncan be valid: Homer is the greatest of poets; this man is the greatest\nof poets; therefore, this man is Homer. And he gives many other\nexamples of such deviant schemes. Valla thus deliberately ignores the\ncriteria employed by Aristotle and his commentators\u2014that at\nleast one premise must be universal, and at least one premise must be\naffirmative, and that if the conclusion is to be negative, one premise\nmust be negative\u2014or, at any rate, he thinks that they\nunnecessarily restrict the number of possible valid figures.\n\nIn his discussion of the syllogism Valla does not refer to an\nimportant principle employed by Aristotle and his commentators:\ndici de omni et nullo (to be said/predicated about all and\nabout none). To quote Peter of Spain\u2019s Summulae\nlogicales: \u201cTo be said of every [dici de\nomni] is when there is nothing to to be taken under the subject\n[nichil est sumere sub subiecto] of which the predicate may\nnot be said, like \u2018every man runs\u2019: here, running is said\nof every man, and under man there is nothing to to be taken of which\nrunning is not said. To be said of none [de nullo]\nis when there is nothing to be taken under the subject from which the\npredicate may not be eliminated, like \u2018no man runs\u2019: here,\nrunning is eliminated from any man at all [quolibet\nhomine]\u201d (ed. L. M. de Rijk 1972, 43; ed. Copenhaver et\nal., 2014, 170). This principle led Aristotle to conclude that only\nfour moods of the first figure were immediately valid. That Valla does\nnot make use of this fundamental condition is understandable from his\noratorical point of view, since it would be an uninteresting or even\nirrelevant criterion of validity. It is therefore not surprising that\nhe thinks that we might as well \u201creduce\u201d the first figure\nto the second rather than vice versa. Likewise, from his oratorical\npoint of view, he can only treat the third figure of the syllogism\nwith contempt: it is a \u201ccompletely foolish\u201d form of\nreasoning; no one reasons as follows: every man is a substance; every\nman is an animal; therefore, some animal is a substance. In a similar\nvein, he rejects the use of letters in the study of syllogisms\n(Repastinatio, 1:297\u2013300; 2:546\u2013548; DD\n2:264\u201371).\n\nValla\u2019s insistence on examining and assessing arguments in terms\nof persuasion and usefulness leads him to criticize not only the\nsyllogism but also other less formal modes of argumentation. These\nmodes usually involve interrogation, resulting in an unexpected or\nunwanted conclusion or an aporetic situation. Some scholars have\nregarded Valla\u2019s interest in these less formal or non-formal\narguments as an expression of a skeptical attitude towards the\npossibility of certainty in knowledge in general. Others have raised\nserious doubts about this interpretation. What we can say for sure,\nhowever, is that Valla was one of the first to study and analyze the\nheap argument, dilemma, and suchlike. The heap argument is supposed to\ninduce doubts about the possibility of determining precise limits,\nespecially to quantities. If I subtract one grain from a heap, is it\nstill a heap? Of course. What if I subtract two grains? And so forth,\nuntil the heap consists of just one grain, which, to be sure, is an\nunacceptable conclusion. It seems impossible to determine the exact\nmoment when the heap ceases to be a heap, and any attempt to determine\nthis moment seems to involve an ad hoc decision, for a heap does not\ncease to be a heap due to the subtraction of just one single grain.\nValla discusses a number of similar cases, and comments on their\nfallacious nature.\n\nDilemma, too, receives extensive treatment from him. This type of\nargument had been widely studied in antiquity. The basic structure is\na disjunction of propositions, usually in the form of a double\nquestion in an interrogation, which sets a trap for the respondent,\nsince whichever horn of the dilemma he chooses, he seems to be caught\nup in a contradiction and will lose the debate (\u201cIf he is\nmodest, why should you accuse someone who is a good man? If he is bad,\nwhy should you accuse someone who is unconcerned by such a\ncharge?\u201d, Cicero, De inventione 1.45.83, cited by Valla\nRepastinatio, 1:321; DD 2:332). It was also\nrecognized that the respondent could often counter the dilemma by\nduplicating the original argument and \u201cturning it back\u201d\n(convertere) on the interrogator, using it as a kind of\nboomerang (\u201cif he is modest, you should accuse him because he\nwill be concerned by such a charge; if he is bad, you should also\naccuse him because he is not a good man\u201d). Alternatively, he\ncould escape the dilemma by questioning the disjunction and showing\nthat there is a third possibility. There were many variations of this\nsimple scheme, and it was studied from a logical as well as a\nrhetorical point of view with considerable overlap between these two\nperspectives.\n\nIn medieval times, dilemma does not seem to have attracted much\ntheoretical reflection, though there was an extensive literature on\nrelated genres such as insolubilia and paradoxes, which were\ngenerally treated in a logical manner. It is, therefore, interesting\nto see Valla discussing a whole range of examples of dilemma. The\nrhetoric textbook by the Byzantine \u00e9migr\u00e9 George of\nTrebizond (1396\u20131486), composed about 1433, was probably an\nimportant source for him. This work might also have led Valla to\nexplore the relevant places in Quintilian, Cicero, the Greek text of\nAristotle\u2019s Rhetoric and perhaps other Greek sources.\nThe example Valla discusses most extensively comes from Aulus Gellius\nand concerns a lawsuit between Protagoras and his pupil Euathlus\n(Repastinatio, 1:312\u2013319; 2:562\u2013568; DD\n2:312\u201328. Aulus Gellius, Noctes Atticae, 5.10.5\u201316).\nThe pupil has promised to pay the second installment of the fees as\nsoon as he has won his first case. He refuses to undertake any cases,\nhowever, and Protagoras takes him to court, putting the case in the\nform of a dilemma. If Euathlus loses the case, he will have to pay the\nrest of the fee, on account of the verdict of the judges; but if\nEuathlus wins, he will also have to pay, this time on account of his\nagreement with Protagoras. Euathlus, however, cleverly converts the\nargument: in neither case will he have to pay, on account of the\ncourt\u2019s decision (if he wins), or on account of the agreement\nwith Protagoras (if he loses). Aulus Gellius thinks that the judges\nshould have refrained from passing judgment because any decision would\nbe inconsistent with itself. But Valla rejects such a rebuttal\n(antistrephon or conversio) of the dilemma and\nthinks that a response may be formulated as long as one concentrates\non the relevant aspects of the case. He carefully considers the\nperspectives of all parties, the words employed, the feelings of the\njudges, and all the circumstances of the case. In a highly rhetorical\nanalysis of the case in which Valla makes speeches on behalf of\nProtagoras, Valla says in the end that Euathlus cannot have it both\nways and must choose one or the other alternative, not both: he must\ncomply either with his agreement with Protagoras (and pay the rest of\nthe fees) or with the verdict passed by the judges. If he loses the\ncase, a refusal to obey the sentence of the judges shows contempt; if\nhe wins the case, he has to pay the rest of the fee to Protagoras. At\nany rate, there is no reason for the judges to despair; Aulus Gellius\nis, therefore, wrong in thinking that they should have refrained\nfrom passing a judgment. In all such cases, Valla argues, the\nconversion is not a rebuttal, but at best a correction of the initial\nargument (a correction, however, is not a refutation), and at worst a\nsimple repetition or illegitimate shift of the initial position.\n\nAn important way of seeing through deceptive arguments is to consider\nthe weight of words carefully, and Valla gives some further examples\nof fallacies which can easily be refuted by examining the meaning and\nusage of words and the contexts in which they occur\n(Repastinatio, 1:320\u2013334; 2:568\u2013578; DD\n2:328\u201369). He considers the fallacies \u201ccollected by Aristotle in\nhis Sophistical Refutations as for the most part a puerile\nart,\u201d quoting the Rhetorica ad Herennium (2.11.16) to\nthe effect that \u201cknowledge of ambiguities as taught by\ndialecticians is of no help at all but rather a most serious\nhindrance.\u201d Valla is not interested in providing a comprehensive\nlist of deceptive arguments and errors or in studying rules for\nresolving them. He does not mention, for example, the basic division\nbetween linguistic (in dictione) and extra-linguistic\n(extra dictionem) fallacies. In a letter to a friend, Valla\nlists some \u201cdialecticians\u201d\u2014Albert of Saxony (c.\n1316\u20131390), Albert the Great (c. 1220\u20131280), Ralph Strode\n(fl. 1350\u20131400), William of Ockham, and Paul of Venice (c.\n1369\u20131429) \u2014but there is no sign that he had done more\nthan leaf through their works on sophismata and\ninsolubilia (Valla 1984, 201). The few examples he gives seem\nto come from Peter of Spain\u2019s Summulae logicales. Nor\nwas it necessary to have more than a superficial acquaintance with the\nworks of these dialecticians in order to realize that their approach\ndiffered vastly from his. As he repeatedly states, what is required in\norder to disambiguate fallacies is not a deeper knowledge of the rules\nof logic but a recognition that arguments need to be evaluated within\ntheir wider linguistic and argumentative context. Such an examination\nof how words and arguments function will easily lay bare the\nartificial and sophistical nature of these forms of argumentation.\n\nThis approach is also evident in Valla\u2019s analysis of the\nproposition of which a syllogism or argument consists. Propositions\nare traditionally divided according to quantity (universal of\nparticular) and to quality (affirmative and negative). Quantity and\nquality are indicated by words that are called signa\n(markers, signs): \u201call,\u201d \u201cany,\u201d\n\u201cnot,\u201d \u201cno one,\u201d and so forth. In Book II of\nthe Repastinatio, Valla considers a much wider range of words\nthan the medieval logicians, who had mainly worked with\n\u201call,\u201d \u201csome,\u201d \u201cnone,\u201d and\n\u201cno one\u201d. To some extent, his aim is not unlike that of\nthe dialecticians whom he so frequently attacks, that is, to study\nsigns of quality and negation and how they determine the scope of a\nproposition. But for him there is only one proper method of carrying\nout such a study: examining carefully the multifarious ways in which\nthese words are used in refined and grammatically correct Latin. Not\nsurprisingly, Valla criticizes the square of contraries\u2014the\nfourfold classification of statements in which the distinction between\nuniversal and particular and that between affirmative and negative are\ncombined. A similar critique of the rather arbitrary restriction to a\nlimited set of words is applied to the scholastic notion of modality\n(Valla Repastinatio, 1:237\u2013244; 2:491\u2013497;\nDD 2:126\u201343). Scholastics usually treat only the following\nsix terms as modals: \u201cpossible,\u201d \u201cimpossible,\u201d\n\u201ctrue,\u201d \u201cfalse,\u201d \u201cnecessary,\u201d and\n\u201ccontingent.\u201d Latin, however, is much more resourceful in\nexpressing modality. Using criteria such as refinement and utility,\nValla considers terms such as \u201clikely/unlikely,\u201d\n\u201cdifficult/easy,\u201d \u201ccertain/uncertain,\u201d\n\u201cuseful/useless,\u201d \u201cbecoming/unbecoming,\u201d and\n\u201chonorable/dishonorable.\u201d This amounts to introducing a\nwholly new concept of modality, which comes close to an adverbial\nqualification of a given action.\n\nValla\u2019s principal b\u00eates noires are Aristotle,\nBoethius, Porphyry, and Peter of Spain, but he also speaks in general\nterms of the entire natio peripatetica (nation of\nPeripatetics). He frequently refers to isti (those), a\nsuitably vague label for the scholastic followers of\nAristotle\u2014including both dialecticians and theologians. It has\noften been claimed that Valla is attacking late medieval\nscholasticism; but it must be said that he does not quote any late\nmedieval scholastic philosophers or theologians. He generally steers\nclear of their questions, arguments, and terminology. If we compare\nValla\u2019s Repastinatio with, for example, Paul of\nVenice\u2019s Logica parva (The Small\nLogic), we quickly perceive the immense difference in attitude,\nargument, and approach. Moreover, as noted above, Valla\u2019s\ngrammatical and oratorical approach is fundamentally different from\nOckham\u2019s terminism. He probably thought that he did not need to\nengage with the technical details of scholastic works. It was\nsufficient for him to establish that there was a huge distance between\nhis own approach and that of the scholastics. Once he had shown that\nthe scholastic-Aristotelian edifice was built on shaky foundations, he\ndid not care to attack the superstructure, so to speak. And Valla\nproved to his own satisfaction that these foundations were shaky by\nshowing that the terminology and vocabulary of the scholastics rested\non a misunderstanding of Latin and of the workings of language in\ngeneral. But even though his criticisms are mainly addressed to\nAristotle, Boethius, and Porphyry, his more general opinion of\nAristotelianism was, of course, formed by what he saw in his own time.\nHe loathed the philosophical establishment at the universities, their\nmethods, genres, and, above all, their style and terminology. He\nthought that they were slavishly following Aristotle. In his view,\nhowever, a true philosopher does not hesitate to re-assess any opinion\nfrom whatever source; refusing to align himself with a sect or school,\nhe presents himself as a critical, independent thinker\n(Repastinatio, 1:1\u20138; 2:359\u2013363; DD\n1:2\u201312). Whether scholasticism had, indeed, ossified by the time Valla\ncame on the scene is a matter of debate; but there is no question that\nthis is how he and the other humanists saw it.\n",
