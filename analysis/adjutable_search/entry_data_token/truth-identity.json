The identity theory maintains, against this, that\nat least some truth-bearers are not made true by, but are\nidentical with, facts. The theory is normally applied not at\nthe level of declarative sentences, but to what such sentences\nexpress. It is these items\u2014or, again, some of them\u2014that\nare held to be identical with facts. Identity theorists diverge over\nthe details of this general picture, depending on what exactly they\ntake declarative sentences to express, whether Fregean thoughts (at\nthe level of sense), Russellian propositions (at the level of\nreference), or both, and depending also on how exactly facts are\nconstrued. But, to give a precise illustration, an identity theorist\nwho thinks that declarative sentences express Russellian propositions\nwill typically hold that true such propositions are identical with\nfacts. The significance of the identity theory, for its supporters, is\nthat it appears to make available the closing of a certain gap that\nmight otherwise be thought to open up between language and world\nand/or between mind and world. If its supporters are right about this,\nthe identity theory of truth potentially has profound consequences\nboth in metaphysics and in the philosophies of mind and language.\n", "toc": [{"#DefiPrelExpo": "1.

Definition and Preliminary Exposition\n\nDeclarative sentences seem to take truth-values, for we say things\nlike\n\n(1)\n \u201cSocrates is wise\u201d is true.\n\n\nBut sentences are apparently not the only bearers of truth-values: for\nwe also seem to allow that what such sentences express, or mean, may\nbe true or false, saying such things as\n\n(2)\n \u201cSocrates is wise\u201d means that Socrates is\n wise,[1]\n\n\nand\n\n (3)\n That Socrates is wise is true\n\n\nor\n\n (4)\n It is true that Socrates is wise.\n\n\nIf, provisionally, we call the things that declarative sentences\nexpress, or mean, their contents\u2014again provisionally,\nthese will be such things as that Socrates is wise\u2014then\nthe identity theory of truth, in its most general form, states that\n(cf. Baldwin 1991: 35):\n\n (5)\n A declarative sentence\u2019s content is true just if that\ncontent is (identical with) a fact.\n\n\nA fact is here to be thought of as, very generally, a way things\nare, or a way the world is. On this approach, the\nidentity theory secures an intimate connection between language (what\nlanguage expresses) and world. Of course there would in principle be\ntheoretical room for a view that identified not the content of, say,\nthe true declarative sentence \u201cSocrates is wise\u201d\u2014let\nus assume from now on that this sentence is true\u2014with the fact\nthat Socrates is wise, but rather that sentence itself. But\nthis is not a version of the theory that anyone has ever advanced, nor\ndoes it appear that it would be plausible to do so (see Candlish\n1999b: 200\u20132; K\u00fcnne 2003: 6). The early Wittgenstein does\nregard sentences as being themselves facts, but they are not identical\nwith the facts that make them true.\n\nAlternatively, and using a different locution, one might say that, to\ncontinue with the same example,\n\n (6)\n That Socrates is wise is true just if that Socrates\nis wise is the case.\n\n\nThe idea here is that (6) makes a connection between language and\nreality: on the left-hand side we have something expressed by a piece\nof language, and on the right-hand side we allude to a bit of reality.\nNow (6) might look truistic, and that status has indeed been claimed\nfor the identity theory, at least in one of its manifestations. John\nMcDowell has argued that what he calls true \u201cthinkables\u201d\nare identical with facts (1996: 27\u20138, 179\u201380). Thinkables\nare things like that Socrates is wise regarded as possible\nobjects of thought. For we can think that Socrates is wise;\nand it can also be the case that Socrates is wise. So the\nidea is that what we can think can also be (identical with) what is\nthe case. That identity, McDowell claims, is truistic. On this\napproach, one might prefer one\u2019s identity theory to take the\nform (cf. Hornsby 1997: 2):\n\n(7)\n All true thinkables are (identical with) facts.\n\n\nOn this approach the identity theory explicitly aims to secure an\nintimate connection between mind (what we think) and world.\n\nA point which has perhaps been obscured in the literature on this\ntopic, but which should be noticed, is that (7) asserts a relation of\nsubordination: it says that true thinkables are a (proper or improper)\nsubset of facts; it implicitly allows that there might be facts that\nare not identical with true thinkables. So (7) is not to be confounded\nwith its converse,\n\n(8)\n All facts are (identical with) true thinkables,\n\n\nwhich asserts the opposite subordination, and says that facts are a\n(proper or improper) subset of true thinkables, implicitly allowing,\nthis time, that there might be true thinkables that are not identical\nwith facts. (8) is therefore distinct from (7), and if (7) is\ncontroversial, (8) is equally or more so, but for reasons that are at\nleast in part different. (8) denies the existence of facts that cannot\nbe grasped in thought. But many philosophers hold it to be evident\nthat there are, or at least could be, such facts\u2014perhaps certain\nfacts involving indefinable real numbers, for example, or in some\nother way going beyond the powers of human thought. So (8) could be\nfalse; its status remains to be established; it can hardly be regarded\nas truistic. Accordingly, one might expect that an identity theorist\nwho wished to affirm (7), and certainly anyone who wanted to say that\n(7) (or (6)) was truistic, would\u2014at least qua identity\ntheorist\u2014steer clear of (8), and leave its status sub\njudice. In fact, however, a good number of identity theorists,\nboth historical and contemporary, incorporate (8) as well as\u2014or\neven instead of\u2014(7) into their statement of the theory. Richard\nCartwright, who published the first modern discussion of the theory in\n1987, wrote that if one were formulating the theory, it would say\n\u201cthat every true proposition is a fact and every fact a true\nproposition\u201d (1987: 74). McDowell states that\n\n\ntrue thinkables already belong just as much to the world as to minds\n[i.e., (7)], and things that are the case already belong just as much\nto minds as to the world [i.e., (8)]. It should not even seem that we\nneed to choose a direction in which to read the claim of identity.\n(2005: 84)\n\n\nJennifer Hornsby takes the theory to state that true thinkables and\nfacts coincide (1997: 2, 9, 17, 20)\u2014they are the same\nset\u2014so that she in effect identifies that theory with the\nconjunction of (7) and (8), as also, in effect, does Julian Dodd\n(2008a: passim). Now, (8) is certainly an interesting thesis\nthat merits much more consideration than it has hitherto received (at\nleast in the recent philosophical literature), and, as indicated, some\nexpositions of the identity theory have as much invested in (8) as in\n(5) or (7): on this point see further\n \u00a72\n below. Nevertheless, it will make for clarity of discussion if we\nassociate the identity theory of truth, more narrowly, with something\nalong the lines of (5) or (7), and omit (8) from this particular\n discussion.[2]\n That will be the policy here.\n\nWhether or not (6) is truistic, both (5) and (7) involve technical or\nsemi-technical vocabulary; moreover, they have been advanced as moves\nin a technical debate, namely one concerning the viability of the\ncorrespondence theory of truth. For these reasons it seems difficult\nto regard them as truisms (see Dodd 2008a: 179). What (5) and (7)\nmean, and which of them one will prefer as one\u2019s statement of\nthe identity theory of truth, if one is favorably disposed to that\ntheory\u2014one may of course be happy with both\u2014will depend,\namong other things, on what exactly one thinks about the nature of\nsuch entities as that Socrates is wise. In order to get clear\non this point, discussion of the identity theory has naturally been\nconducted in the context of the Fregean semantical hierarchy, which\ndistinguishes between levels of language, sense, and reference. Frege\nrecognized what he called \u201cthoughts\u201d (Gedanken)\nat the level of sense corresponding to (presented by) declarative\nsentences at the level of language. McDowell\u2019s thinkables are\nmeant to be Fregean thoughts: the change of terminology is intended to\nstress the fact that these entities are not thoughts in the sense of\ndated and perhaps spatially located individual occurrences (thinking\nevents), but are abstract contents that are at least in principle\navailable to be grasped by different thinkers at different times and\nplaces. So a Fregean identity theory of truth would regard both such\nentities as that Socrates is wise and, correlatively, facts\nas sense-level entities: this kind of identity theory will then state\nthat true such entities are identical with facts. This approach will\nnaturally favor (7) as its expression of the identity theory.\n\nBy contrast with Frege, Russell abjured the level of sense and (at\nleast around 1903\u20134) recognized what, following Moore, he called\n\u201cpropositions\u201d as worldly entities composed of objects and\nproperties. A modern Russellian approach might adopt these\npropositions\u2014or something like them: the details of\nRussell\u2019s own conception are quite vague\u2014as the referents\nof declarative sentences, and identity theorists who followed this\nline might prefer to take a particular reading of (5) as their slogan.\nSo these Russellians would affirm something along the lines of:\n\n(9)\n All true Russellian propositions are identical with facts (at the\nlevel of reference),\n\n\nby contrast with the Fregean\n\n(10)\n All true Fregean thoughts are identical with facts (at the level\nof sense).\n\n\nThis way of formulating the relevant identity claims has the advantage\nof suggesting that it would, at least in principle, be open to a\ntheorist to combine (9) and (10) in a hybrid position that (i)\ndeparted from Russell and followed Frege by admitting both a\nlevel of Fregean sense and one of reference, and also, having\nadmitted both levels to the semantic hierarchy, (ii) both\nlocated Fregean thoughts at the level of sense and located\nRussellian propositions at the level of reference. Sense being mode of\npresentation of reference, the idea would be that declarative\nsentences refer, via Fregean thoughts, to Russellian\npropositions (for this disposition, see Gaskin 2006: 203\u201320;\n2008: 56\u2013127). So someone adopting this hybrid approach would\naffirm both (9) and (10). Of course, the facts mentioned in (9) would\nbe categorially different from the facts mentioned in (10),\nand one might choose to avoid confusion by distinguishing them\nterminologically, and perhaps also by privileging one set of facts,\nontologically, over the other. If one wanted to follow this\nprivileging strategy, one might say, for instance, that only\nreference-level facts were genuine facts, the relata\nof the identity relation at the level of sense being merely\nfact-like entities, not bona fide facts. That would\nbe to give the combination of (9) and (10) a Russellian spin.\nAlternatively, someone who took the hybrid line might prefer to give\nit a Fregean spin, saying that the entities with which true Fregean\nthoughts were identical were the genuine facts, and that the\ncorresponding entities at the level of reference that true Russellian\npropositions were identical with were not facts as such, but fact-like\ncorrelates of the genuine facts. Without more detail, of course, these\nprivileging strategies leave the status of the entities they are\ntreating as merely fact-like unclear; and, as far as the\nFregean version of the identity theory goes, commentators who identify\nfacts with sense-level Fregean thoughts usually, as we shall see,\nrepudiate reference-level Russellian propositions altogether, rather\nthan merely downgrading their ontological status, and so affirm (10)\nbut reject (9). We shall return to these issues in\n \u00a74\n below.\n2. Historical Background\n\nThe expression \u201cthe identity theory of truth\u201d was first\nused\u2014or, at any rate, first used in the relevant sense\u2014by\nStewart Candlish in an article on F. H. Bradley published in 1989. But\nthe general idea of the theory had been in the air during the 1980s:\nfor example, in a discussion first published in 1985, concerning John\nMackie\u2019s theory of truth, McDowell criticized that theory for\nmaking \n\n\ntruth consist in a relation of correspondence (rather than identity)\nbetween how things are and how things are represented as being. (1985\n[1998: 137 n. 21]) \n\n\nThe implication is that identity would be the right way to conceive\nthe given relation. And versions of the identity theory go back at\nleast to Bradley (see, e.g., Bradley 1914: 112\u201313; for further\ndiscussion and references, see Candlish 1989; 1995; 1999b:\n209\u201312; T. Baldwin 1991: 36\u201340), and to the founding\nfathers of the analytic tradition (Sullivan 2005: 56\u20137 n. 4).\nThe theory can be found in G. E. Moore\u2019s \u201cThe Nature of\nJudgment\u201d (1899), and in the entry he wrote on\n\u201cTruth\u201d for J. Baldwin\u2019s Dictionary of\nPhilosophy and Psychology (1902\u20133; reprinted Moore 1993:\n4\u20138, 20\u20131; see T. Baldwin 1991: 40\u20133). Russell\nembraced the identity theory at least during the period of his 1904\ndiscussions of Meinong (see, e.g., 1973: 75), possibly also in his\nThe Principles of Mathematics of 1903, and for a few years\nafter these publications as well (see T. Baldwin 1991: 44\u20138;\nCandlish 1999a: 234; 1999b: 206\u20139). Frege has a statement of the\ntheory in his 1919 essay \u201cThe Thought\u201d, and may have held\nit earlier (Frege 1918\u201319: 74 [1977: 25]; see Hornsby 1997:\n4\u20136; Milne 2010: 467\u20138).\n\nWittgenstein\u2019s Tractatus (1922) is usually held to\npropound a correspondence rather than an identity theory of truth;\nhowever this is questionable. In the Tractatus, declarative\nsentences (S\u00e4tze) are said to be facts (arrangements of\nnames), and states of affairs (Sachlagen,\nSachverhalte, Tatsachen) are also said to be facts\n(arrangements of objects). If the Tractatus is taken to put\nforward a correspondence theory of truth, then presumably the idea is\nthat a sentence will be true just if there is an appropriate relation\nof correspondence (an isomorphism) between sentence and state of\naffairs. However, the problem with this interpretation is that, in the\nTractatus, a relation of isomorphism between a sentence and\nreality is generally conceived as a condition of the\nmeaningfulness of that sentence, not specifically of its\ntruth. False sentences, as well as true, are isomorphic with\nstates of affairs\u2014only, in their case the states of affairs do\nnot obtain. For Wittgenstein, states of affairs may either obtain or\nfail to obtain\u2014both possibilities are, in general, available to\n them.[3]\n Correlatively, it has been suggested that the Tractatus\ncontains two different conceptions of fact, a factive and a\nnon-factive one. According to the former conception, facts necessarily\nobtain or are the case; according to the latter, facts may fail to\nobtain or not be the case. This non-factive conception has been\ndiscerned at Tractatus 1.2\u20131.21, and at 2.1 (see\nJohnston 2013: 382). Given that, in the Tractatus, states of\naffairs (and perhaps facts) have two poles\u2014obtaining or being\nthe case, and non-obtaining or not being the case\u2014it seems to\nfollow that, while Wittgenstein is committed to a correspondence\ntheory of meaning, his theory of truth must be (some\nversion of) an identity theory, along the lines of \n\n\nA declarative sentence is true just if what it is semantically\ncorrelated with is identical with an obtaining state of affairs (a\nfactive fact). \n\n\n(Identity theorists normally presuppose the factive conception of\nfacts, so that \u201cfactive\u201d is redundant in the phrase\n\u201cfactive facts\u201d, and that is the policy which will be\nfollowed here.) Though a bipolar conception of facts (if indeed\nWittgenstein has it) may seem odd, the bipolar conception of states of\naffairs (which, it is generally agreed, he does have) seems quite\nnatural: here the identity theorist says that a true proposition is\nidentical with an obtaining state of affairs (see Candlish &\nDamnjanovic 2018: 271\u20132).\n\nPeter Sullivan has suggested a different way of imputing an identity\ntheory to the Tractarian Wittgenstein (2005: 58\u20139). His idea is\nthat Wittgenstein\u2019s simple objects are to be identified with\nFregean senses, and that in effect the Tractatus contains an\nidentity theory along the lines of (7) or (10). Sullivan\u2019s\nground for treating Tractarian objects as senses is that, like\nbona fide Fregean senses, they are transparent: they\ncannot be grasped in different ways. An apparent difficulty with this\nview is that there is plausibly more to Fregean sense than just the\nproperty of transparency: after all, Russell also attached the\nproperty of transparency to his basic objects, but it has not been\nsuggested that Russellian basic objects are really senses, and the\nsuggestion would seem to have little going for it (partly, though not\nonly, because Russell himself disavowed the whole idea of Fregean\nsense).The orthodox position, which will be presupposed here, is that\nthe Tractarian Wittgenstein like Russell, finds no use for a level of\nFregean sense, so that his semantical hierarchy consists exclusively\nof levels of language and reference, with nothing of a mediatory or\nsimilar nature located between these levels. (Wittgenstein does appeal\nto the concepts of sense and reference in the\nTractatus, but it is generally agreed that they do not figure\nin a Fregean way, according to which both names and sentences, for\nexample, have both sense and reference; for Wittgenstein, by contrast,\nsentences have sense but not reference, whereas names have reference\nbut not sense.)\n3. Motivation\n\nWhat motivates the identity theory of truth? It can be viewed as a\nresponse to difficulties that seem to accrue to at least some versions\nof the correspondence theory (cf. Dodd 2008a: 120, 124). The\ncorrespondence theory of truth holds that truth consists in a relation\nof correspondence between something linguistic or quasi-linguistic, on\nthe one hand, and something worldly on the other. Generally, the items\non the worldly end of the relation are taken to be facts or\n(obtaining) states of affairs. For many purposes these two latter\nkinds of entity (facts, obtaining states of affairs) are assimilated\nto one another, and that strategy will be followed here. The exact\nnature of the correspondence theory will then depend on what the other\nrelatum is taken to be. The items mentioned so far make\navailable three distinct versions of the correspondence theory,\ndepending on whether this relatum is taken to consist of\ndeclarative sentences, Fregean thoughts, or Russellian propositions.\nModern correspondence theorists make a distinction between\ntruth-bearers, which would typically fall under one of these\nthree classifications, and\n truth-makers,[4]\n the worldly entities making truth-bearers true, when they are true.\nIf these latter entities are facts, then true declarative sentences,\nFregean thoughts, or Russellian propositions\u2014whichever of these\none selects as the relata of the correspondence relation on the\nlanguage side of the language\u2013world divide\u2014correspond to\nfacts in the sense that facts are what make those sentences, thoughts,\nor propositions true, when they are true. (Henceforth we shall\nnormally speak simply of thoughts and propositions, understanding\nthese to be Fregean thoughts and Russellian propositions respectively,\nunless otherwise specified.)\n\nThat, according to the correspondence theorist (and the identity\ntheorist can agree so far), immediately gives us a constraint on the\nshape of worldly facts. Take our sample sentence \u201cSocrates is\nwise\u201d, and recall that this sentence is here assumed to be true.\nAt the level of reference we encounter the object Socrates and\n(assuming realism about\n properties)[5]\n the property of wisdom. Both of these may be taken to be entities in\nthe world, but it is plausible that neither amounts to a fact: neither\namounts to a plausible truth-maker for the sentence \u201cSocrates is\nwise\u201d, or for its expressed thought, or for its expressed\nproposition. That is because the man Socrates, just as such, and the\nproperty of wisdom, just as such, are not, so the argument goes,\npropositionally structured, either jointly or severally, and so do not\namount to enough to make it true that Socrates is wise (cf. D.\nArmstrong 1997: 115\u201316; Dodd 2008a: 7; Hofweber 2016: 288). Even\nif we add in further universals, such as the relation of\ninstantiation, and indeed the instantiation of instantiation to any\ndegree, the basic point seems to be unaffected. In fact it can\nplausibly be maintained (although some commentators disagree; Merricks\n2007: ch. 1, passim, and pp. 82, 117, 168; Asay 2013:\n63\u20134; Jago 2018: passim, e.g., pp. 73, 84, 185, 218,\n250, though cf. p. 161) that the man Socrates, just as such, is not\neven competent to make it true that Socrates exists; for that we need\nthe existence of the man Socrates. Hence, it would appear\nthat, if there are to be truth-makers in the world, they will have to\nbe structured, syntactically or quasi-syntactically, in the same\ngeneral way as declarative sentences, thoughts, and propositions. For\nconvenience we can refer to structure in this general sense as\n\u201cpropositional structure\u201d: the point then is that neither\nSocrates, nor the property of wisdom, nor (if we want to adduce it)\nthe relation of instantiation is, just as such, propositionally\nstructured. Following this line of argument through, we reach the\nconclusion that nothing short of full-blown, propositionally\nstructured entities like the fact that Socrates is wise will\nbe competent to make the sentence \u201cSocrates is wise\u201d, or\nthe thought or proposition expressed by that sentence, true. (A\nquestion that arises here is whether tropes might be able to provide a\n\u201cthinner\u201d alternative to such ontologically\n\u201crich\u201d entities as the fact that Socrates is\nwise. One problem that seems to confront any such strategy is\nthat of making the proposed alternative a genuine one, that is, of\nconstruing the relevant tropes in such a way that they do not simply\ncollapse into, or ontologically depend on, entities of the relatively\nrich form that Socrates is wise. For discussion see Dodd\n2008a: 7\u20139.)\n\nThe question facing the correspondence theorist is now: if such\npropositionally structured entities are truth-makers, are they\ntruth-makers for sentences, thoughts, or propositions? It is at this\npoint that the identity theorist finds the correspondence theory\nunsatisfactory. Consider first the suggestion that the worldly fact\nthat Socrates is wise is the truth-maker for the\nreference-level proposition that Socrates is wise (see, e.g.,\nJago 2018: 72\u20133, and passim). There surely are such\nfacts as the fact that Socrates is wise: we talk about such\nthings all the time. The problem would seem to be not with the\nexistence of such facts, but rather with the relation of\ncorrespondence which is said by the version of the correspondence\ntheory that we are currently considering to obtain between the fact\nthat Socrates is wise and the proposition that Socrates\nis wise. As emerges from this way of expressing the difficulty,\nthere seems to be no linguistic difference between the way we talk\nabout propositions and the way we talk about facts, when these\nentities are specified by \u201cthat\u201d clauses. That suggests\nthat facts just are true propositions. If that is right, then\nthe relation between facts and true propositions is not one of\ncorrespondence\u2014which, as Frege famously observed (Frege\n1918\u201319: 60 [1977: 3]; cf. K\u00fcnne 2003: 8; Milne 2010:\n467\u20138), implies the distinctness of the\nrelata\u2014but identity.\n\nThis line of argument can be strengthened by noting the following\npoint about explanation. Correspondence theorists have typically\nwanted the relation of correspondence to explain truth: they\nhave usually wanted to say that it is because the proposition\nthat Socrates is wise corresponds to a fact that it is true,\nand because the proposition that Socrates is\nfoolish\u2014or rather: It is not the case that Socrates is\nwise (after all, his merely being foolish is not enough to\nguarantee that he is not wise, for he might, like James I and VI, be\nboth wise and foolish)\u2014does not correspond to a fact that it is\nfalse. But the distance between the true proposition that Socrates\nis wise and the fact that Socrates is wise seems to be\ntoo small to provide for explanatory leverage. Indeed the identity\ntheorist\u2019s claim is that there is no distance at all. Suppose we\nask: Why is the proposition that Socrates is wise true? If we\nreply by saying that it is true because it is a fact that Socrates\nis wise, we seem to have explained nothing, but merely repeated\nourselves (cf. Strawson 1971: 197; Anscombe 2000: 8; Rasmussen 2014:\n39\u201343). So correspondence apparently gives way to identity as\nthe relation which must hold or fail to hold between a proposition and\na state of affairs if the proposition is to be true or false: the\nproposition is true just if it is identical with an obtaining state of\naffairs and false if it is not (cf. Horwich 1998: 106). And it would\nseem that, if the identity theorist is right about this disposition,\nexplanatory pretensions will have to be abandoned: for while it will\nbe correct to say that a proposition is true just if it is identical\nwith a fact, false otherwise, it is hard to see that much of substance\nhas thereby been said about truth (cf. Hornsby 1997; 2; Dodd 2008a;\n135).\n\nIt might be replied here that there are circumstances in which we\ntolerate statements of the form \u201cA because\nB\u201d when an appropriate identity\u2014perhaps even\nidentity of sense, or reference, or both\u2014obtains between\n\u201cA\u201d and \u201cB\u201d. For example, we say\nthings like \u201cHe is your first cousin because he is a child of a\nsibling of one of your parents\u201d (K\u00fcnne 2003: 155). But here\nit is plausible that there is a definitional connection between\nleft-hand side and right-hand side, which seems not to hold of \n\n\nThe proposition that Socrates is wise is true because it is a\nfact that Socrates is wise. \n\n\nIn the latter case there is surely no question of definition; rather,\nwe are supposed, according to the correspondence theorist, to have an\nexample of metaphysical explanation, and that is just what, according\nto the identity theorist, we do not have. After all, the identity\ntheorist will insist, it seems obvious that the relation, whatever it\nis, between the proposition that Socrates is wise and the\nfact that Socrates is wise must, given that the proposition\nis true, be an extremely close one: what could this relation be? If\nthe identity theorist is right that the relation cannot be one of\nmetaphysical explanation (in either direction), then it looks as\nthough it will be hard to resist the insinuation of the linguistic\ndata that the relation is one of identity.\n\nIt is for this reason that identity theorists sometimes insist that\ntheir position should not be defined in terms of an identity between\ntruth-bearer and truth-maker: that way of expressing the theory looks\ntoo much in thrall to correspondence theorists\u2019 talk (cf.\nCandlish 1999b: 200\u20131, 213). For the identity theorist, to speak\nof both truth-makers and truth-bearers would imply that the things\nallegedly doing the truth-making were distinct from the things that\nwere made true. But, since in the identity theorist\u2019s view there\nare no truth-makers distinct from truth-bearers, if the latter are\nconceived as propositions, and since nothing can make itself true, it\nfollows that there are no truth-makers simpliciter, only\ntruth-bearers. It seems to follow, too, that it would be ill-advised\nto attack the identity theory by pointing out that some (or all)\ntruths lack truth-makers (so Merricks 2007: 181): so long as truths\nare taken to be propositions, that is exactly what identity theorists\nthemselves say. From the identity theorist\u2019s point of view,\ntruth-maker theory looks very much like an exercise in splitting the\nlevel of reference in half and then finding a bogus match between the\ntwo halves (see McDowell 1998: 137 n. 21; Gaskin 2006: 203; 2008:\n119\u201327). For example, when David Armstrong remarks that \n\n\nWhat is needed is something in the world which ensures that a\nis F, some truth-maker or ontological ground for\na\u2019s being F. What can this be except the state of\naffairs of a\u2019s being F? (1991: 190) \n\n\nthe identity theorist is likely to retort that a\u2019s being\nF, which according to Armstrong \u201censures\u201d that\na is F,just is the entity (whatever it is)\nthat a is F. The identity theorist maps conceptual\nconnections that we draw between the notions of proposition, truth,\nfalsity, state of affairs, and fact. These connections look trivial,\nwhen spelt out\u2014of course, an identity theorist will counter that\nto go further would be to fall into error\u2014so that to speak of an\nidentity theory can readily appear too grand (McDowell 2005:\n83; 2007: 352. But cf. David 2002: 126). So much for the thesis that\nfacts are truth-makers and propositions truth-bearers; an\nexactly parallel argument applies to the version of the correspondence\ntheory that treats facts as truth-makers and thoughts as\ntruth-bearers.\n\nConsider now the suggestion that obtaining states of affairs, as the\ncorrespondence theorist conceives them, make declarative\nsentences (as opposed to propositions) true (cf. Horwich 1998:\n106\u20137). In this case there appears to be no threat of triviality\nof the sort that apparently plagued the previous version of the\ncorrespondence theory, because states of affairs like that\nSocrates is wise are genuinely distinct from linguistic items\nsuch as the sentence \u201cSocrates is wise\u201d. To that extent\nfriends of the identity theory need not jib at the suggestion that\nsuch sentences have worldly truth-makers, if that is how the relation\nof correspondence is being glossed. But they might question the\nappropriateness of the gloss. For, they might point out, it does not\nseem possible, without falsification, to draw detailed links between\nsentences and bits of the world. After all, different sentences in the\nsame or different languages can \u201ccorrespond\u201d to the same\nbit of the world, and these different sentences might have very\ndifferent (numbers of) components. The English sentence \u201cThere\nare cows\u201d contains three words: are there then three bits in the\nworld corresponding to this sentence, and making it true? (cf. Neale\n2001: 177). The sentence \u201cCows\nexist\u201d contains only two words, but would not the correspondence\ntheorist want to say that it was made true by the same chunk of\nreality? And when we take other languages into account, there seems in\nprinciple to be no reason to privilege any particular number and say\nthat a sentence corresponding to the relevant segment of reality must\ncontain that number of words: why might there not, in\nprinciple, be sentences of actual or possible languages such that, for\nany n \u2265 1, there existed a sentence comprising n\nwords and meaning the same as the English \u201cThere are\ncows\u201d? (In fact, is English not already such a language? Just\nprefix and then iterate ad lib. a vacuous operator like\n\u201cReally\u201d.)\n\nIn a nutshell, then, the identity theorist\u2019s case against the\ncorrespondence theory is that, when the truth-making relation is\nconceived as originating in a worldly fact (or similar) and having as\nits other relatum a true sentence, the claim that this\nrelation is one of correspondence cannot be made out; if, on the other\nhand, the relevant relation targets a proposition (or\nthought), then that relation must be held to be one of identity, not\ncorrespondence.\n4. Identity, Sense, and Reference\n\nIdentity theorists are agreed that, in the case of any particular\nrelevant identity, a fact will constitute the worldly relatum\nof the relation, but there is significant disagreement among them on\nthe question what the item on the other end of the relation\nis\u2014whether a thought or a proposition (or both). As we have\nseen, there are three possible positions here: (i) one which places\nthe identity relation exclusively between true thoughts and facts,\n(ii) one which places it exclusively between true propositions and\nfacts, and (iii) a hybrid position which allows identities of both\nsorts (identities obtaining at the level of sense will of course be\nquite distinct from identities obtaining at the level of reference).\nWhich of these positions an identity theorist adopts will depend on\nwider metaphysical and linguistic considerations that are strictly\nextraneous to the identity theory as such.\n\nIdentity theorists who favor (i) generally do so because they want to\nhave nothing to do with propositions as such. That is to say,\nsuch theorists eschew propositions as reference-level\nentities: of course the word \u201cproposition\u201d\nmay be, and sometimes is, applied to Fregean thoughts at the level of\nsense, rather than to Russellian propositions at the level of\nreference. For example, Hornsby (1997: 2\u20133) uses\n\u201cproposition\u201d and \u201cthinkable\u201d interchangeably.\nSo far, this terminological policy might be considered neutral with\nrespect to the location of propositions and thinkables in the Fregean\nsemantic hierarchy: that is to say, if one encounters a theorist who\ntalks about \u201cthinkables\u201d and \u201cpropositions\u201d,\neven identifying them, one does not, just so far, know where in the\nsemantic hierarchy this theorist places these entities. In particular,\nwe cannot assume, unless we are specifically told so, that our\ntheorist locates either propositions or thinkables at the level of\nsense. After all, someone who houses propositions at the\nlevel of reference holds that these reference-level entities are\nthinkable, in the sense that they are graspable in\nthought (perhaps via thoughts at the level of sense). But they\nare not thinkables if this latter word is taken, as it is by\nMcDowell and Hornsby, to be a technical term referring to entities at\nthe level of sense. For clarity the policy here will be to continue to\napply the word \u201cproposition\u201d exclusively to Russellian\npropositions at the level of reference. Such propositions, it is\nplausible to suppose, can be grasped in thought, but by definition\nthey are not thoughts or thinkables, where these two latter terms\nhave, respectively, their Fregean and McDowellian meanings. It is\nworth noting that this point, though superficially a merely\nterminological one, engages significantly with the interface between\nthe philosophies of language and mind that was touched on in the\nopening paragraph. Anyone who holds that reference-level propositions\ncan, in the ordinary sense, be thought\u2014are thinkable\u2014is\nlikely to be unsatisfied with any terminology that seems to limit the\ndomain of the thinkable and of what is thought to the level of sense\n(On this point see further below in this section, and Gaskin 2020:\n101\u20132).\n\nUsually, as has been noted, identity theorists who favor (i) above\nhave this preference because they repudiate propositions as that term\nis being employed here: that is, they repudiate propositionally\nstructured reference-level entities. There are several reasons why\nsuch identity theorists feel uncomfortable with propositions when\nthese are understood to be reference-level entities. There is a fear\nthat such propositions, if they existed, would have to be construed as\ntruth-makers; and identity theorists, as we have seen, want to have\nnothing to do with truth-makers (Dodd 2008a: 112). That fear could\nperhaps be defused if facts were also located at the level of\nreference for true propositions to be identical with. This move would\ntake us to an identity theory in the style of (ii) or (iii) above.\nAnother reason for suspicion of reference-level propositions is that\ncommentators often follow Russell in his post-1904 aversion\nspecifically to false objectives, that is, to false\npropositions in re (Russell 1966: 152; Cartwright 1987:\n79\u201384). Such entities are often regarded as too absurd to take\nseriously as components of reality (so T. Baldwin 1991: 46; Dodd 1995:\n163; 1996; 2008a: 66\u201370, 113\u201314, 162\u20136). More\nespecially, it has been argued that false propositions in re\ncould not be unities, that the price of unifying a proposition at the\nlevel of reference would be to make it true: if this point were\ncorrect it would arguably constitute a reductio ad absurdum\nof the whole idea of reference-level propositions, since it is\nplausible to suppose that if there cannot be false reference-level\npropositions, there cannot be true ones either (see Dodd 2008a: 165).\nIf, on the other hand, one is happy with the existence of propositions\nin re or reference-level propositions, both true and\n false,[6]\n one is likely to favor an identity theory in the style of (ii) or\n(iii). And, once one has got as far as jettisoning (i) and deciding\nbetween (ii) and (iii), there must surely be a good case for adopting\n(iii): for if one has admitted propositionally structured entities\nboth at the level of sense (as senses of declarative sentences) and at\nthe level of reference (propositions), there seems no good reason not\nto be maximally liberal in allowing identities between entities of\nthese two types and, respectively, sense- and reference-level kinds of\nfact (or fact-like entities).\n\nAgainst what was suggested above about Frege\n (\u00a72),\n it has been objected that Frege could not have held an identity\ntheory of truth (Baldwin 1991: 43); the idea here is that, even if he\nhad acknowledged states of affairs as bona fide elements of\nreality, Frege could not have identified true thoughts with them on\npain of confusing the levels of sense and reference. As far as the\nexegetical issue is concerned, the objection might be said to overlook\nthe possibility that Frege identified true thoughts with facts\nconstrued as sense-level entities, rather than with states of\naffairs taken as reference-level entities; and, as we have\nnoted, Frege does indeed appear to have done just this (see Dodd &\nHornsby 1992). Still, the objection raises an important theoretical\nissue. It would surely be a serious confusion to try to construct an\nidentity across the categorial division separating sense and\nreference, in particular to attempt to identify true Fregean thoughts\nwith reference-level facts or states of\n affairs.[7]\n It has been suggested that McDowell and Hornsby are guilty of this\n confusion;[8]\n they have each rejected the\n charge,[9]\n insisting that, for them, facts are not reference-level entities, but\nare, like Fregean thoughts, sense-level\n entities.[10]\n\nBut, if one adheres to the Fregean version of the identity theory ((i)\nabove), which identifies true thoughts with facts located at the level\nof sense, and admits no correlative identity, in addition, connecting\ntrue propositions located at the level of reference with facts or\nfact-like entities also located at that level, it looks as though one\nfaces a difficult dilemma. At what level in the semantical hierarchy\nis the world to be placed? Suppose first one puts it at the level of\nreference (this appears to be Dodd\u2019s favored view: see 2008a:\n180\u20131, and passim). In that case the world will contain\nno facts or propositions, but just objects and properties hanging\nloose in splendid isolation from one another, a dispensation which\nlooks like a version of Kantian transcendental idealism. (Simply\ninsisting that the properties include not merely monadic but also\npolyadic ones, such as the relation of instantiation, will not in\nitself solve the problem: we will still just have a bunch of separate\nobjects, properties, and relations.) If there are no true\npropositions\u2014no facts\u2014or even false propositions to be\nfound at the level of reference, but if also, notwithstanding that\nabsence, the world is located there, the objects it contains will, it\nseems, have to be conceived as bare objects, not as things of certain\nsorts. Some philosophers of a nominalistic bias might be happy with\nthis upshot; but the problem is how to make sense of the idea of a\nbare object\u2014that is, an object not characterized by any\nproperties. (Properties not instantiated by any objects, by contrast,\nwill not be problematic, at least not for a realist.)\n\nSo suppose, on the other hand, that one places the world at the level\nof sense, on the grounds that the world is composed of facts, and that\nthat is where facts are located. This ontological dispensation is\nexplicitly embraced by McDowell (1996: 179). The problem with this way\nout of the dilemma would seem to be that, since Fregean senses are\nconstitutively modes of presentation of referents, the strategy under\ncurrent consideration would take the world to be made up of modes of\npresentation\u2014but of what? Of objects and properties? These are\ncertainly reference-level entities, but if they are presented by items\nin the realm of sense, which is being identified on this approach with\nthe world, then again, as on the first horn of the dilemma, they would\nappear to be condemned to an existence at the level of reference in\nsplendid isolation from one another, rather than in propositionally\nstructured combinations, so that once more we would seem to be\ncommitted to a form of Kantian transcendental idealism (see Suhm,\nWagemann, & Wessels 2000: 32; Sullivan 2005: 59\u201361; Gaskin\n2006:199\u2013203). Both ways out of the dilemma appear to have this\nunattractive consequence. The only difference between those ways\nconcerns where exactly in the semantic hierarchy we locate the world;\nbut it is plausible that that issue, in itself, is or ought to be of\nless concern to metaphysicians than the requirement to avoid divorcing\nobjects from the properties that make those objects things of certain\nsorts; and both ways out of the dilemma appear to flout this\nrequirement.\n\nTo respect the requirement, we need to nest reference-level objects\nand properties in propositions, or proposition-like structures, also\nlocated at the level of reference. And then some of these structured\nreference-level entities\u2014the true or obtaining ones\u2014will,\nit seems, be facts, or at least fact-like. Furthermore, once one\nacknowledges the existence of facts, or fact-like entities, existing\nat the level of sense, it seems in any case impossible to\nprevent the automatic generation of facts, or fact-like entities,\nresiding at the level of reference. For sense is mode of\npresentation of reference. So we need reference-level facts or\nfact-like entities to be what sense-level facts or fact-like entities\npresent. One has to decide how to treat these variously\nhoused fact-like entities theoretically. If one were to insist that\nthe sense-level fact-like entities were the genuine and only\nfacts, the corresponding reference-level entities would be no\nbetter than fact-like, and contrariwise. But, regardless\nwhether the propositionally structured entities automatically\ngenerated in this way by sense-level propositionally structured\nentities are to be thought of as proper facts or merely as fact-like\nentities, it would seem perverse not to identify the world with these\n entities.[11]\n For to insist on continuing to identify the world with sense-level\nrather than reference-level propositionally structured entities would\nseem to fly in the face of a requirement to regard the world as\nmaximally objective and maximally non-perspectival. McDowell himself\nhopes to avert any charge of embracing an unacceptable idealism\nconsequent on his location of the world at the level of sense by\nrelying on the point that senses present their references directly,\nnot descriptively, so that reference is, as it were, contained in\nsense (1996: 179\u201380). To this it might be objected that the\nrequirement of maximal objectivity forces an identification of the\nworld with the contained, not the containing, entities in this\nscenario, which in turn seems to force the upshot\u2014if the threat\nof Kantian transcendental idealism is really to be obviated\u2014that\nthe contained entities be propositionally structured as such, that is,\nas contained entities, and not simply in virtue of being\ncontained in propositionally structured containing entities. (For a\ndifferent objection to McDowell, see Sullivan 2005: 60 n. 6.)\n5. Difficulties with the Theory and Possible Solutions\n5.1 The modal problem\n\nG. E. Moore drew attention to a point that might look (and has been\nheld to be) problematic for the identity theory (Moore 1953: 308; Fine\n1982: 46\u20137; K\u00fcnne 2003: 9\u201310). The proposition\nthat Socrates is wise exists in all possible worlds where\nSocrates and the property of wisdom exist, but in some of those worlds\nthis proposition is true and in others it is false. The fact that\nSocrates is wise, by contrast, only exists in those worlds where\nthe proposition both exists and is true. So it would seem that the\nproposition that Socrates is wise cannot be identical with\nthe fact that Socrates is wise. They have different modal\nproperties, and so by the principle of the indiscernibility of\nidenticals they cannot be identical.\n\nNote, first, that this problem, if it is a problem, has nothing\nespecially to do with the identity theory of truth or with facts. It\nseems to arise already for true propositions and propositions taken\nsimpliciter before ever we get to the topic of facts. That\nis, one might think that the proposition that Socrates is\nwise is identical with the true proposition that Socrates is\nwise (assuming, as we are doing, that this proposition\nis true); but we then face the objection that the proposition\ntaken simpliciter and the true proposition differ in their\nmodal properties, since (as one might suppose) the true proposition\nthat Socrates is wise does not exist at worlds where the\nproposition that Socrates is wise is false, but the\nproposition taken simpliciter does. Indeed the problem, if it\nis a problem, is still more general, and purported solutions to it go\nback at least to the Middle Ages (when it was discussed in connection\nwith Duns Scotus\u2019 formal distinction; see Gaskin 2002 [with\nreferences to further relevant literature]). Suppose that Socrates is\na cantankerous old curmudgeon. Now grumpy Socrates, one would think,\nis identical with Socrates. But in some other possible worlds Socrates\nis of a sunny and genial disposition. So it would seem that Socrates\ncannot be identical with grumpy Socrates after all, because in these\nother possible worlds, while Socrates goes on existing, grumpy\nSocrates does not exist\u2014or so one might argue.\n\nCan the identity theorist deal with this problem, and if so how? Here\nis one suggestion. Suppose we hold, staying with grumpy Socrates for a\nmoment, that, against the assumption made at the end of the last\nparagraph, grumpy Socrates does in fact exist in worlds where\nSocrates has a sunny disposition. The basis for this move would be the\nthought that, after all, grumpy Socrates is identical with\nSocrates, and Socrates exists in these other worlds. So\ngrumpy Socrates exists in those worlds too; it is just that he is not\ngrumpy in those worlds. (Suppose Socrates is very grumpy;\nsuppose in fact that grumpiness is so deeply ingrained in his\ncharacter that worlds in which he is genial are quite far away.\nSomeone surveying the array of possible worlds, starting from the\nactual world and moving out in circles, and stumbling at long last\nupon a world with a pleasant Socrates in it, might register the\ndiscovery by exclaiming, with relief, \u201cOh look! Grumpy Socrates\nis not grumpy over here!\u201d.) Similarly, one might contend, the\ntrue proposition, and fact, that Socrates is wise goes on\nexisting in the worlds where Socrates is not wise, because the true\nproposition, and fact, that Socrates is wise just is\nthe proposition that Socrates is wise, and that proposition\ngoes on existing in these other worlds, but in those worlds that true\nproposition, and fact, is not a true proposition, or a fact. (In\nScotist terms one might say that the proposition that Socrates is\nwise and the fact that Socrates is wise are really\nidentical but formally distinct.)\n\nThis solution was, in outline, proposed by Richard Cartwright in his\n1987 discussion of the identity theory (Cartwright 1987: 76\u20138;\ncf. David 2002: 128\u20139; Dodd 2008a: 86\u20138; Candlish &\nDamnjanovic 2018: 265\u20136). According to Cartwright, the true\nproposition, and fact, that there are subways in Boston\nexists in other possible worlds where Boston does not have subways,\neven though in those worlds that fact would be not be a fact.\n(Compare: grumpy Socrates exists in worlds where Socrates is genial\nand sunny, but he is not grumpy there.) So even in worlds where it is\nnot a fact that Boston has subways, that\nfact, namely the fact that Boston has subways, continues to\nexist. Cartwright embellishes his solution with two controversial\npoints. First, he draws on Kripke\u2019s distinction between rigid\nand non-rigid designation, suggesting that his solution can be\ndescribed by saying that the expression \u201cThe fact that\nBoston has subways\u201d is a non-rigid designator. But it is\nplausible that that expression goes on referring to, or being\nsatisfied by (depending on how exactly one wants to set up the\nsemantics of definite descriptions: see Gaskin 2008: 56\u201381), the\nfact that Boston has subways in possible worlds where Boston\ndoes not have subways; it is just that, though that fact exists in\nthose worlds, it is not a fact there. But that upshot does not appear\nto derogate from the rigidity of the expression in\nquestion. Secondly, Cartwright allows for a true\nreading of \u201cThe fact that there are subways in Boston\nmight not have been the fact that there are subways in\nBoston\u201d. But it is arguable that we should say that this\nsentence is just false (David 2002: 129). The fact that there are\nsubways in Boston would still have gone on being the same\nfact in worlds where Boston has no subways, namely the fact\nthat there are subways in Boston; it is just that in those\nworlds this fact would not have been a fact. You\nmight say: in that world the fact that there are subways\nin Boston would not be correctly described as a fact, but in\ntalking about that world we are talking about it from the point of\nview of our world, and in our world it is a fact. (Similarly with\ngrumpy Socrates.)\n\nNow, an objector may want to press the following point against the\nabove purported solution to the difficulty. Consider again the fact\nthat Socrates is wise. Surely, it might be said, it is more\nnatural to maintain that that fact does not exist in a\npossible world where Socrates is not wise, rather than that it exists\nthere all right, but is not a fact. After all, imagine a conversation\nabout a world in which Socrates is not wise and suppose that Speaker\nA claims that Socrates is indeed wise in that world. Speaker\nB might counter with \n\n\nNo, sorry, you\u2019re wrong: there is no such fact in that world;\nthe purported fact that Socrates is wise simply does not\nexist in that world. \n\n\nIt might seem odd to insist that B is not allowed to say this\nand must say instead \n\n\nYes, you\u2019re right that there is such a fact in that world,\nnamely the fact that Socrates is wise, but in that world\nthat fact is not a fact;. \n\n\nHow might the identity theorist respond to this objection? One\npossible strategy would be to make a distinction between fact\nand factuality, as follows. Factuality, one might\nsay, is a reification of facts. Once you have a fact, you also get, as\nan ontological spin-off, the factuality of that fact. The\nfact, being a proposition, exists at all possible worlds where the\nproposition exists, though in some of these worlds it may not be a\nfact: it will not be a fact in worlds where the proposition is false.\nThe factuality of that fact, by contrast, only exists at those worlds\nwhere the fact is a fact\u2014where the proposition is true.\nSo factuality is a bit like a trope. Compare grumpy Socrates again.\nGrumpy Socrates, the identity theorist might contend, exists at all\nworlds where Socrates exists, though at some of those worlds he is not\ngrumpy. But Socrates\u2019 grumpiness\u2014that particular\ntrope\u2014exists only at worlds where Socrates is grumpy. That seems\nto obviate the problem, because the suggestion being canvassed here is\nthat grumpy Socrates is identical not with Socrates\u2019\ngrumpiness\u2014so that the fact that these two entities have\ndifferent modal properties need embarrass no one\u2014but rather with\nSocrates. Similarly, the suggestion is that the proposition\nthat Socrates is wise is identical not with the\nfactuality of the fact that Socrates is wise, but\njust with that fact. So the identity theorist would\naccommodate the objector\u2019s point by insisting that\nfacts exist at possible worlds where their\nfactualities do not exist.\n\nThe reader may be wondering why this problem was ever raised against\nthe identity theory of truth in the first place. After all, the\nidentity theorist does not say that propositions simpliciter\nare identical with facts, but that true propositions are\nidentical with facts, and now true propositions and facts surely have\nexactly the same modal properties: for regardless how things\nare with the sheer proposition that Socrates is wise, at any\nrate the true proposition that Socrates is wise must\nsurely be thought to exist at the same worlds as the fact that\nSocrates is wise, whatever those worlds are. However, as against\nthis quick way with the purported problem, there stands the intuition,\nmentioned and exploited above, that the true proposition that\nSocrates is wise is identical with the proposition that\nSocrates is wise. So long as that intuition is in play, the\nproblem does indeed seem to arise\u2014for true propositions, in the\nfirst instance, and then for facts by transitivity of identity. But\nthe identity theorist will maintain that, as explained, the problem\nhas a satisfactory solution.\n5.2 The \u201cright fact\u201d problem\n\nCandlish, following Cartwright, has urged that the identity theory of\ntruth is faced with the difficulty of getting hold of the \u201cright\nfact\u201d (Cartwright 1987: 74\u20135; Candlish 1999a: 238\u20139;\n1999b: 202\u20134). Consider a version of the identity theory that\nstates:\n\n(11)\n The proposition that p is true just if it is\nidentical with a\n fact.[12]\n\n\nCandlish\u2019s objection is now that (11)\n\n\ndoes not specify which fact has to be identical with the\nproposition for the proposition to be true. But what the identity\ntheory requires is not that a true proposition be identical with\nsome fact or other, it is that it be identical with the\nright fact. (1999b: 203)\n\n\nIn another paper Candlish puts the matter like this:\n\n\nBut after all, any proposition might be identical with some\nfact or other (and there are reasons identified in the\nTractatus for supposing that all propositions are themselves\nfacts), and so all might be true. What the identity theory needs to\ncapture is the idea that it is by virtue of being identical\nwith the appropriate fact that a proposition is true. (1999a:\n239)\n\n\nThe reference to the Tractatus is suggestive. Of course, it\nmight be objected that the Tractatus does not have\npropositions in the sense of that word figuring here: that is, it does\nnot recognize Russellian propositions (propositions at the level of\nreference). Nor indeed does it appear to recognize Fregean thoughts.\nIn the Tractatus, as we have noted\n (\u00a72),\n declarative sentences (S\u00e4tze) are facts (arrangements\nof names), and states of affairs (Sachlagen,\nSachverhalte, Tatsachen) are also facts\n(arrangements of objects). Even so, Candlish\u2019s allusion to the\nTractatus reminds us that propositions (in our sense)\nare Tractarian inasmuch as they are structured\narrangements of entities, namely objects and properties.\n(Correlatively, thoughts are structured arrangements of senses.) False\npropositions (and false thoughts) will equally be arrangements of\nobjects and properties (respectively, senses). So the difficulty that\nCartwright and Candlish have identified can be put like this.\nPlausibly any proposition, whether or not it is true, is\nidentical with some fact or other given that a proposition is\nan arrangement of entities of the appropriate sort. But if\npropositions just are facts, then every proposition\nis identical with some fact\u2014at the very least, with\nitself\u2014whether it is true or false. So the right-to-left\ndirection of (11) looks incorrect.\n\nJ. C. Beall (2000) attempts to dissolve this problem on the identity\ntheorist\u2019s behalf by invoking the principle of the\nindiscernibility of identicals. His proposal works as follows. If we\nask, in respect of (11), what the \u201cright\u201d fact is, it\nseems that we can answer that the \u201cright\u201d fact must at\nleast have the property of being identical with the proposition\nthat p, and the indiscernibility principle then guarantees\nthat there is only one such fact. This proposal is open to an obvious\nretort. Suppose that the proposition that p is false.\nThat proposition will still be identical with itself, and if we are\nsaying (in Wittgensteinian spirit) that propositions are facts, then\nthat proposition will be identical with at least one fact, namely\nitself. So it will satisfy the right-hand side of (11), its falsity\nnotwithstanding. But reflection on this retort suggests a patch-up to\nBeall\u2019s proposal: why not say that the right fact is\nthe fact that p? We would then be able to gloss (11)\nwith\n\n(12)\n The proposition that p is true just if (a) it is\na fact that p, and (b) the proposition that\np is identical with that fact.\n\n\nFalsity, it seems, now no longer presents a difficulty, because if it\nis false that p then it is not a fact that\np, so that (a) fails, and there is no appropriate\ncandidate for the proposition that p to be identical\n with.[13]\n Notice that, in view of the considerations already aired in\nconnection with the modal problem ((i) of this section), caution is\nhere required. Suppose that it is true that p in the\nactual world, but false in some other possible world. According to the\nstrategy that we have been considering on the identity\ntheorist\u2019s behalf, it would be wrong to say that, in the\npossible world where it is false that p, there is no\nsuch fact as the fact that p. The strategy has it that\nthere is indeed such a fact, because it is (in the actual world) a\nfact that p, and that fact, and the true proposition,\nthat p, go on existing in the possible world where it\nis false that p; it is just that that fact is\nnot a fact in that possible world. But (12), the identity\ntheorist will maintain, deals with this subtlety. In the possible\nworld we are considering, where it is false that p,\nthough the fact that p exists, it is not a fact\nthat p, so (a) fails, and there is accordingly no risk\nof our getting hold of the \u201cwrong\u201d fact. Note also that if\na Wittgensteinian line is adopted, while the (false) proposition that\np will admittedly be identical with a fact\u2014at\nthe very least with itself\u2014it will be possible, given the\nfailure of (a), for the identity theorist to contend with a clear\nconscience that that fact is the wrong fact, which does not\nsuffice to render the proposition true.\n5.3 The \u201cslingshot\u201d problem\n\nIf the notorious \u201cslingshot\u201d argument worked, it would\npose a problem for the identity theory of truth. The argument exists\nin a number of different, though related, forms, and this is not the\nplace to explore all of these in\n detail.[14]\n Here we shall look briefly at what is one of the simplest and most\nfamiliar versions of the argument, namely Davidson\u2019s. This\nversion of the argument aims to show that if true declarative\nsentences refer to anything (for example to propositions or facts),\nthen they all refer to the same thing (to the \u201cGreat\nProposition\u201d, or to the \u201cGreat Fact\u201d). This upshot\nwould be unacceptable to an identity theorist of a Russellian cast,\nwho thinks that declarative sentences refer to propositions, and that\ntrue such propositions are identical with facts: any such theorist is\nnaturally going to want to insist that the propositions referred to by\ndifferent declarative sentences are, at least in general, distinct\nfrom one another, and likewise that the facts with which distinct true\npropositions are identical are also distinct from one another.\nDavidson expresses the problem that the slingshot argument purportedly\nthrows up as follows:\n\n\nThe difficulty follows upon making two reasonable assumptions: that\nlogically equivalent singular terms have the same reference; and that\na singular term does not change its reference if a contained singular\nterm is replaced by another with the same reference. But now suppose\nthat \u201cR\u201d and \u201cS\u201d abbreviate any\ntwo sentences alike in truth value. (1984: 19)\n\n\nHe then argues that the following four sentences have the same\nreference:\n\n(13)\n \\(R\\)\n\n\n(14)\n \\(\\hat{z}(z\\! =\\! z \\amp R) = \\hat{z}(z\\! =\\! z)\\)\n\n\n(15)\n \\(\\hat{z}(z\\! =\\! z \\amp S) = \\hat{z}(z\\! =\\! z \\))\n\n\n(16)\n \\(S\\)\n\n\n(The hat over a variable symbolizes the description operator: so\n\u201c\\(\\hat{z}\\)\u201d means the \\(z\\) such that \u2026)\nThis is because (13) and (14) are logically equivalent, as are (15)\nand (16), while the only difference between (14) and (15) is that (14)\ncontains the expression (Davidson calls it a \u201csingular\nterm\u201d) \u201c\\(\\hat{z} (z\\! =\\! z \\amp R)\\)\u201d whereas (15)\ncontains \u201c\\(\\hat{z} (z\\! =\\! z \\amp S)\\)\u201d,\n\n\nand these refer to the same thing if S and R are alike\nin truth value. Hence any two sentences have the same reference if\nthey have the same truth value. (1984: 19)\n\n\nThe difficulty with this argument, as a number of writers have pointed\nout (see, e.g., Yourgrau 1987; Gaskin 1997: 153 n. 17; K\u00fcnne\n2003: 133\u201341), and the place where the identity theorist is\nlikely to raise a cavil, lies in the first assumption on which it\ndepends. Davidson calls this assumption \u201creasonable\u201d, but\nit has been widely questioned. It states \u201cthat logically\nequivalent singular terms have the same reference\u201d. But\nintuitively, the ideas of logical equivalence and reference seem to be\nquite distinct, indeed to have, as such, little to do with one\nanother, so that it would be odd if there were some a priori\nreason why the assumption had to hold. And it is not difficult to\nthink of apparent counterexamples: the sentence \u201cIt is\nraining\u201d is logically equivalent to the sentence \u201cIt is\nraining and (either Pluto is larger than Mercury or it is not the case\nthat Pluto is larger than Mercury)\u201d, but the latter sentence\nseems to carry a referential payload that the former does not. Of\ncourse, if declarative sentences refer to truth-values, as Frege\nthought, then the two sentences will indeed be co-referential, but to\nassume that sentences refer to truth-values would be question-begging\nin the context of an argument designed to establish that all true\nsentences refer to the same thing.\n5.4 The congruence problem\n\nA further objection to the identity theory, going back to an\nobservation of Strawson\u2019s, takes its cue from the point that\ncanonical names of propositions and of facts are often not\nstraightforwardly congruent with one another: they are often not\nintersubstitutable salva congruitate (or, if they are, they\nmay not be intersubstitutable salva veritate) (Strawson 1971:\n196; cf. K\u00fcnne 2003: 10\u201312). For example, we say that\npropositions are true, not that they obtain, whereas we say that facts\nobtain, not that they are true. How serious is this point? The\nobjection in effect presupposes that for two expressions to be\nco-referential, or satisfied by one and the same thing, they must be\nsyntactically congruent, have the same truth-value potential, and\nmatch in terms of general contextual suitability. The assumption of\nthe syntactic congruence of co-referential expressions is\ncontroversial, and it may be possible for the identity theorist simply\nto deny it (see Gaskin 2008: 106\u201310, for argument on the point,\nwith references to further literature; cf. Dodd 2008a: 83\u20136.).\nWhether co-referential expressions must be syntactically congruent\ndepends on one\u2019s conception of reference, a matter that cannot\nbe further pursued here (for discussion see Gaskin 2008: ch. 2; 2020:\nchs. 3\u20135).\n\nThere has been a good deal of discussion in the literature concerning\nthe question whether an identification of facts with true propositions\nis undermined not specifically by phenomena of syntactic\nincongruence but rather by failure of relevant intersubstitutions to\npreserve truth-values (see, e.g., King 2007: ch. 5; King in\nKing, Soames, & Speaks 2014: 64\u201370, 201\u20138; Hofweber\n2016: 215\u201323; Candlish & Damnjanovic 2018: 264). The\ndiscussion has focused on examples like the following:\n\n(17)\n Daniel remembers the fact that this is a leap year;\n\n\n(18)\n Daniel remembers the true proposition that this is a leap\nyear;\n\n\n(19)\n The fact that my local baker has shut down is just\nappalling;\n\n\n(20)\n The true proposition that my local baker has shut down is just\nappalling.\n\n\nThe problem here is said to be that the substitution of \u201ctrue\nproposition\u201d for \u201cfact\u201d or vice versa generates\ndifferent readings (in particular, readings with different\ntruth-values). Suppose Daniel has to memorize a list of true\npropositions, of which one is the proposition that this is a leap\nyear. Then it is contended that we can easily imagine a scenario in\nwhich (17) and (18) differ in truth-value. Another way of putting the\nsame point might be to say that (17) is equivalent to\n\n(21)\n Daniel remembers that this is a leap year,\n\n\nbut that (18) is not equivalent to (21), because\u2014so the argument\ngoes\u2014(18) but not (21) would be true if Daniel had memorized his\nlist of true propositions without realizing that they were\ntrue. Similar differences can be argued to apply, mutatis\nmutandis, to (19) and (20). Can the identity theorist deal with\nthis difficulty?\n\nIn the first place one might suggest that the alleged mismatch between\n(17) and (18) is less clear than the objector claims. (17) surely does\nhave a reading like the one that is said to be appropriate for (18).\nSuppose Daniel has to memorize a list of facts. (17) could then\ndiverge in truth-value from\n\n(22)\n Daniel remembers the fact that this is a leap year as a\nfact.\n\n\nFor there is a reading of (17) on which, notwithstanding (17)\u2019s\ntruth, (22) is false: this is the reading on which Daniel has indeed\nmemorized a list of facts, but without necessarily realizing that the\nthings he is memorizing are facts. He has memorized the\nrelevant fact (that this is a leap year), we might say, but not\nas a fact. That is parallel to the reading of (18) according\nto which Daniel has memorized the true proposition that this is a leap\nyear, but not as a true proposition. The identity theorist\nmight then aver that, perhaps surprisingly, the same point actually\napplies to the simple (21), on the grounds that this sentence can mean\nthat Daniel remembers the propositional object that this is a leap\nyear (from a list of such objects, say, that he has been asked to\nmemorize), with no implication that he remembers it either as a\nproposition or as a fact. So, according to this\nresponse, the transparent reading of (18)\u2014which has Daniel\nremember the propositional object, namely that this is a leap\nyear, but not necessarily remember it as a fact, or even\nas the propositional object that this is a leap year (he\nremembers it under some other mode of presentation)\u2014is also\navailable for (17) and for (21).\n\nWhat about the opaque reading of either (17) or (21), which implies\nthat Daniel knows for a fact that this is a leap\nyear\u2014is that reading available for (18) too? The identity\ntheorist might maintain that this reading is indeed available, and\nthen explain why we tend not to use sentences like (18) in the\nrelevant sense, preferring sentences of the form of (17) or (21), on\nthe basis of the relative technicality of the vocabulary of (18). The\nidea would be that it is just an accident of language that we prefer\neither (17) or (21) to (18) where what is in question is the sense\nthat implies that Daniel has propositional knowledge that this is a\nleap year (is acquainted with that fact as a fact), as opposed to\nhaving mere acquaintance, under some mode of presentation or other,\nwith the propositional object which happens to be (the fact) that\nthis is a leap year. And if we ask why we prefer (17) or (21)\nto\n\n(23)\n Daniel remembers the proposition that this is a leap year,\n\n\nthen the answer will be the Gricean one that (23) conveys less\ninformation than (17) or (21), under the reading of these two\nsentences that we are usually interested in, according to which Daniel\nremembers the relevant fact as a fact, for (23) is compatible with the\nfalsity of \u201cThis is a leap year\u201d. Hence to use (23) in a\nsituation where one was in a position to use (17) or (21) would carry\na misleading conversational implicature. That, at any rate, is one\npossible line for the identity theorist to take. (It is worth noting\nhere that, if the identity theorist is right about this, it will\nfollow that the \u201cknow that\u201d construction will be subject\nto a similar ambiguity as the \u201cremember that\u201d\nconstruction, given that remembering is a special case of knowing.\nThat is: \u201cA knows that p\u201d will mean\neither \u201cA is acquainted with the fact that\np, and is acquainted with it as a fact\u201d or\nmerely \u201cA is acquainted with the fact that\np, but not necessarily with it as\nsuch\u2014either as a fact or even as a propositional\nobject\u201d.)\n5.5 The individuation problem\n\nIt might appear that we individuate propositions more finely than\nfacts: for example, one might argue that the fact that Hesperus is\nbright is the same fact as the fact that Phosphorus is\nbright, but that the propositions in question are different (see\non this point K\u00fcnne 2003: 10\u201312; Candlish & Damnjanovic\n2018: 266\u20137). The identity theorist has a number of strategies\nin response to this objection. One would be simply to deny it, and\nmaintain that facts are individuated as finely as propositions: if one\nis a supporter of the Fregean version of the identity theory, this is\nlikely to be one\u2019s response (see, e.g., Dodd 2008a: 90\u20133).\nAlternatively, one might respond by saying that, if there is a good\npoint hereabouts, at best it tells only against the Fregean and\nRussellian versions of the identity theory, not against the hybrid\nversion. The identity theory in the hybrid version can agree that we\nsometimes think of facts as extensional, reference-level entities and\nsometimes also individuate propositions or proposition-like entities\nintensionally. Arguably, these twin points do indeed tell against\neither a strict Fregean or a strict Russellian version of the identity\ntheory: they tell against the strict Fregean position because, as well\nas individuating facts intensionally, we also, sometimes, individuate\nfacts extensionally; and they tell against the strict Russellian\nposition because, as well as individuating facts extensionally, we\nalso, sometimes, individuate facts intensionally. But it is plausible\nthat the hybrid version of the identity theory is not touched by the\nobjection, because that version of the theory accommodates\npropositionally structured and factual entities at both levels of\nsense and reference, though different sorts of these entities at these\ndifferent levels\u2014either propositions at the level of sense and\ncorrelative proposition-like entities at the level of reference or\nvice versa, and similarly, mutatis mutandis, for\nfacts and fact-like entities. It will follow, then, for this version\nof the identity theory, that Fregean thoughts and Russellian\npropositions are available, if true, to be identical with the factual\nentities of the appropriate level (sense and reference, respectively),\nand the individuation problem will not then, it seems, arise.\nPropositions or propositionally structured entities will be\nindividuated just as finely as we want them to be individuated, and at\neach level of resolution there will be facts or fact-like entities,\nindividuated to the same resolution, for them to be identical with, if\n true.[15]\n5.6 Truth and Intrinsicism\n\nThe solutions to these problems, if judged satisfactory, seem to\ndirect us to a conception of truth that has been called\n\u201cintrinsicist\u201d (Wright 1999: 207\u20139), and\n\u201cprimitivist\u201d (Candlish 1999b: 207). This was a conception\nrecognized by Moore and Russell who, in the period when they were\nsympathetic to the identity theory, spoke of truth as a simple and\nunanalysable property (Moore 1953: 261; 1993: 20\u20131; Russell\n1973: 75; Cartwright 1987: 72\u20135; Johnston 2013: 384). The point\nhere would be as follows. There are particular, individual\nexplanations of the truth of many propositions. For example, the true\nproposition that there was a fire in the building will be explained by\nalluding to the presence of combustible material, enough oxygen, a\nspark caused by a short-circuit, etc. So, case by case, we will (at\nleast often) be able to provide explanations why given propositions\nare true, and science is expanding the field of such explanations all\nthe time. But according to the intrinsicist, there is no prospect of\nproviding a general explanation of truth, in the sense of an\naccount that would explain, in utterly general terms, why any\ntrue proposition was true. At that general level, according to the\nintrinsicist, there is nothing interesting to be said about what makes\ntrue propositions true: there are only the detailed case-histories. An\nintrinsicist may embrace one or another version of the identity theory\nof truth: what has to be rejected is the idea that the truth of a true\nproposition might consist in a relation to a distinct\nfact\u2014that the truth of the true proposition that Socrates is\nwise, for example, might consist in anything other than\nidentity with the fact that Socrates is wise. On this\napproach, truth is held to be both intrinsic to propositions, and\n primitive.[16]\n Intrinsicism was not a popular position, at least until recently:\nCandlish described it as \u201cso implausible that almost no one else\n[apart from Russell, in 1903\u20134] has been able to take it\nseriously\u201d (1999b: 208); but it may be gaining in popularity now\n(see, e.g., Asay 2013).\n\nCandlish (1999b: 208) thinks that intrinsicism and the identity theory\nare competitors, but perhaps that view is not mandatory. Intrinsicism\nsays that truth is a simple and unanalysable property of propositions;\nthe identity theory says that a true proposition is identical with a\nfact (and with the right fact). These statements will seem to clash\nonly if the identity theory is taken to propound a heavy-duty analysis\nof truth. But if, following recent exponents of the theory, we take it\nrather to be merely spelling out a connection between two entities\nthat we have in our ontology anyway, namely true propositions and\nfacts, and which turn out (like Hesperus and Phosphorus) to be\nidentical, on the basis of a realization that an entity like that\nSocrates is wise is both a true proposition and a fact, then any\nincipient clash between intrinsicism and the identity theory will, it\nseems, be averted. On this approach, a natural thing to say will be\nthat the identity theory describes the way in which truth is\na simple and unanalysable property.\n", "bibliography": {"categories": [], "cat_ref_text": {"ref_list": ["Anscombe, G.
