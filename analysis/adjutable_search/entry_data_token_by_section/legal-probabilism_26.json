    "main_text": "Naked Statistical Evidence || Revisionist responses\n6.3 Revisionist responses\n\nThe puzzles of naked naked statistical evidence are some of the most\ndifficult for legal probabilism. They directly challenge the claim\nthat a high probability should suffice for a judgment of criminal or\ncivil liability. One line of response that legal probabilists can\npursue is to recommend revising our intuitions in hypothetical cases\nand questioning their relevance as a guide for theorizing about\nstandards of proof. Legal probabilists can argue that the preference\nfor traditional forms of evidence over statistical evidence is an\nunwarranted bias (Laudan 2006; Papineau forthcoming). They can point\nout that research in psychology and cognitive science has shown that\neyewitness testimony and fingerprint evidence are often unreliable\n(Simons and Chabris 1999), prone to manipulation (Loftus 1979\n[1996]), and influenced by subjective considerations and matters of\ncontext (Dror, Charlton, and P\u00e9ron 2006; Zabell 2005).\nRelying on statistical evidence, on the other hand, should improve the\noverall accuracy of trial decisions (Koehler and Shaviro 1990).\nLegal probabilists can also argue that the puzzles of naked\nstatistical evidence are confined to hypotheticals, and our judgments\nabout statistical evidence may well differ in more realistic cases\n(Hedden and Colyvan 2019; Ross 2021).\n\nFew have defended such revisionist views, however. The literature\nhas predominantly tried to vindicate the intuitive difference between\nnaked statistical evidence and other forms of evidence. What follows\nis a discussion of some of the proposals in the literature, focusing\nspecifically on the probabilistic ones. An examination of the\nnon-probabilistic solutions to the paradoxes of naked statistical\nevidence falls outside the scope of this entry (for critical surveys,\nsee Redmayne 2008; Gardiner 2018; Pardo 2019).\n",
