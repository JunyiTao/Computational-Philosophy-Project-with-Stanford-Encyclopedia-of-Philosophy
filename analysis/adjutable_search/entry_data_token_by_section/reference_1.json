    "main_text": "Proper Names\n2. Proper Names\n\nProper names have long taken center stage in debates about linguistic\nreference. For present purposes, we\u2019ll treat these as roughly\nco-extensive with what ordinary (non-philosophically trained) speakers\nstandardly call \u2018names\u2019. So expressions like \u2018Barack\nObama\u2019, \u2018Kyoto\u2019, and \u2018Mount Kilimanjaro\u2019\nwill all count as proper names for our purposes. What do these\nexpressions have in common? In virtue of what do they constitute a\ngenuine class of linguistic expressions? At least at first\nglance, these would appear to be syntactically simple\nexpressions that refer, or at least purport to refer, to\nparticular objects or individuals. Thus, \u2018Barack\nObama\u2019 refers to a particular man, \u2018Kyoto\u2019 refers to\na particular city, and \u2018Mount Kilimanjaro\u2019 refers to a\nparticular mountain. And, even though it is questionable whether\nexpressions such as \u2018Santa Claus\u2019 and \u2018Sherlock\nHolmes\u2019 actually refer to anything, there can be no\ndoubt that they at least purport to refer: to Santa Claus and\nSherlock Holmes, respectively. They are thus to be counted as proper\nnames as well for present purposes.\n\nWith respect to proper names, there are two basic orientations that\nhave long captured philosophers\u2019 attention: one that views names on\nthe model of tags, and another that views them on the model of\ndescriptions. We\u2019ll briefly survey these two views, along with some\ncomplications that arise for each. Then we\u2019ll turn to a problem that\narises for both sorts of view: explaining how reference works for\nnames with more than one bearer.\n",
