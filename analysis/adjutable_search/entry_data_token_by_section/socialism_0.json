    "main_text": "Socialism and Capitalism\n1. Socialism and Capitalism\n\nSocialism is best defined in contrast with capitalism, as socialism\nhas arisen both as a critical challenge to capitalism, and as a\nproposal for overcoming and replacing it. In the classical, Marxist\ndefinition (G.A. Cohen 2000a: ch.3; Fraser 2014: 57\u20139),\ncapitalism involves certain relations of production. These\ncomprise certain forms of control over the productive\nforces\u2014the labor power that workers deploy in\nproduction and the means of production such as natural\nresources, tools, and spaces they employ to yield goods and\nservices\u2014and certain social patterns of economic interaction\nthat typically correlate with that control. Capitalism displays the\nfollowing constitutive features:\n\n\n (i) The bulk of the\nmeans of production is privately owned and\ncontrolled.\n (ii) People legally\nown their labor power. (Here capitalism differs from slavery and\nfeudalism, under which systems some individuals are entitled to\ncontrol, whether completely or partially, the labor power of\nothers).\n (iii) Markets\nare the main mechanism allocating inputs and outputs of production and\ndetermining how societies\u2019 productive surplus is used, including\nwhether and how it is consumed or invested.\n\n\n\nAn additional feature that is typically present wherever\n(i)\u2013(iii) hold, is that:\n\n\n (iv) There is a\nclass division between capitalists and workers, involving\nspecific relations (e.g., whether of bargaining, conflict, or\nsubordination) between those classes, and shaping the labor market,\nthe firm, and the broader political process.\n\n\n\nThe existence of wage labor is often seen by socialists as a necessary\ncondition for a society to be counted as capitalist (Schweickart 2002\n[2011: 23]). Typically, workers (unlike capitalists) must sell their\nlabor power to make a living. They sell it to capitalists, who (unlike\nthe workers) control the means of production. Capitalists typically\nsubordinate workers in the production process, as capitalists have\nasymmetric decision-making power over what gets produced and how it\ngets produced. Capitalists also own the output of production and sell\nit in the market, and they control the predominant bulk of the flow of\ninvestment within the economy. The relation between capitalists and\nworkers can involve cooperation, but also relations of conflict (e.g.,\nregarding wages and working conditions). This more-or-less\nantagonistic power relationship between capitalists and workers plays\nout in a number of areas, within production itself, and in the broader\npolitical process, as in both the economic and political domains\ndecisions are made about who does what, and who gets what.\n\nThere are possible economic systems that would present exceptions, in\nwhich (iv) does not hold even if (i), (ii) and (iii) all obtain.\nExamples here are a society of independent commodity producers or a\nproperty-owning democracy (in which individuals or groups of workers\nown firms). There is debate, however, as to how\nfeasible\u2014accessible and stable\u2014these are in a modern\neconomic environment (O\u2019Neill 2012).\n\nAnother feature that is also typically seen as arising where\n(i)\u2013(iii) hold is this:\n\n\n (v) Production is\nprimarily oriented to capital accumulation (i.e., economic\nproduction is primarily oriented to profit rather than to the\nsatisfaction of human needs). (G.A. Cohen 2000a; Roemer\n2017).\n\n\n\nIn contrast to capitalism, socialism can be defined as a type of\nsociety in which, at a minimum, (i) is turned into (i*):\n\n\n (i*) The bulk of the\nmeans of production is under social, democratic control.\n\n\n\nChanges with regard to features (ii), (iii), and (v) are hotly debated\namongst socialists. Regarding (ii), socialists retain the view that\nworkers should control their labor power, but many do not affirm the\nkind of absolute, libertarian property rights in labor power that\nwould, e.g., prevent taxation or other forms of mandatory contribution\nto cater for the basic needs of others (G.A. Cohen 1995). Regarding\n(iii), there is a recent burgeoning literature on \u201cmarket\nsocialism\u201d, which we discuss below, where proposals are advanced\nto create an economy that is socialist but nevertheless features\nextensive markets. Finally, regarding (v), although most socialists\nagree that, due to competitive pressures, capitalists are bound to\nseek profit maximization, some puzzle over whether when they do this,\nit is \u201cgreed and fear\u201d and not the generation of resources\nto make others besides themselves better-off that is the dominant,\nmore basic drive and hence the degree to which profit-maximization\nshould be seen as a normatively troubling phenomenon. (See Steiner\n2014, in contrast with G.A. Cohen 2009, discussing the case of\ncapitalists amassing capital to give it away through charity.)\nFurthermore, some socialists argue that the search for profits in a\nmarket socialist economy is not inherently suspicious (Schweickart\n2002 [2011]). Most socialists, however, tend to find the profit motive\nproblematic.\n\nAn important point about this definition of socialism is that\nsocialism is not equivalent to, and is arguably in conflict with,\nstatism. (i*) involves expansion of social power\u2014power based on\nthe capacity to mobilize voluntary cooperation and collective\naction\u2014as distinct from state power\u2014power based on the\ncontrol of rule-making and rule enforcing over a territory\u2014as\nwell of economic power\u2014power based on the control of material\nresources (Wright 2010). If a state controls the economy but is not in\nturn democratically controlled by the individuals engaged in economic\nlife, what we have is some form of statism, not socialism (see also\nArnold n.d. in\n Other Internet Resources (OIR);\n Dardot & Laval 2014).\n",
