    "main_text": "Plato\u2019s myths in the Platonist tradition\n8. Renaissance illustrations of Plato\u2019s myths\n\nPlato was a celebrated figure in the Renaissance but only a few\nillustrations of Platonic mythical motifs can be found. Perhaps\nPlato\u2019s attitude to visual representation\u2014claiming so\noften that the highest philosophical knowledge is devoid of it, and\nattacking poets and artists in general more than once\u2014inhibited\nand discouraged attempts to capture in painting, sculpture or prints,\nthe mythical scenes Plato himself depicted so vividly in words.\nPerhaps artists simply felt themselves unequal to the task. McGrath\n(2009) reviews and analyzes the rare illustrations of Platonic\nmythical figures and landscapes in Renaissance iconography: the\nandrogyne of the Symposium, the charioteer of the\nPhaedrus, the Cave, and the spindle of the universe\nhandled by Necessity and the Fates of the Republic.\n",
