    "main_text": "Reasoning and Formal Methods\n7. Method, Science, and Faith\n\nPart IV begins by rehearsing the defense of metaphysical and\nscientific knowledge against skeptical philosophy. Following\nDescartes, it is argued that some items can be so distinctly perceived\nthat they cannot be sincerely doubted. That one must exist in order to\nthink, credited to Augustine rather than Descartes, is cited as an\nexample. \u201cThe whole is greater than the part\u201d and similar\nprinciples constitute another set of examples which were not much\ndisputed. The same holds for geometrical propositions, but when\nCartesians took these as being true of the essence of matter,\nsceptical resistance was plentiful. Against this, the authors\u2019\nonly counter is that careful attention reveals the truth as they see\nit.\n\nChapter 2 introduces a version of the crucial distinction between the\nmethods of analysis (sometimes called resolution) and\nsynthesis (sometimes called composition). The authors regard\nanalysis as more important method because it is a method for\ndiscovering truths. Synthesis is the presentation of knowledge as\nfollowing from given premises. The material might be presented as\nformal deductions as in logic texts including Part III of the\nLogic. An alternative kind of synthetic presentation finds a\nconclusion in geometrical style as following from definitions and\naxioms. Descartes argued that the main function of synthesis is to\ninstruct others in what is already known\u2014especially to compel\ntheir assent if they are \u201cargumentative or stubborn\u201d\n(Meditations, Replies to second set of objections [CSM II,\n110\u2013111]).\n\nAn analytic treatment begins with the question under\nexamination\u2014the item that is to be analytically demonstrated. A\nsuccessful analysis separates out what is contained in the question\nuntil some previously known items are found. One example the authors\nprovide is a sketch of an analysis of magnetic phenomena, summarizing\na case that Descartes dealt with in some detail (IV.2, 236; Descartes\nRules, rule 12 [CSM I, 49\u201350] and Descartes 1644, Part\n4 [CSM I, 276\u2013279]. Carefully attending to a lodestone, the goal\nis to\n\n\ndistinctly conceive a certain combination of beings and natures that\nare known to us so as to produce all the effects we see in\nmagnets.\n\n\nIf the previously known \u201cbeings and natures\u201d are revealed\nto have been contained in the question and thus to analytically follow\nfrom it, the analysis is complete. If instead some absurdity or\nimpossibility is contained in the question, the analysis shows it is\nfalse. Because analysis depends on this kind of careful attention to\nwhat is contained, the method \u201cconsists more in judgment and\nmental skill than in particular rules\u201d (IV.2, 238).\n\nThis description is closely related to the general principle that the\nLogic laid down for the evaluation of syllogisms. That\nprinciple required that one take the conclusion of a syllogism as true\nand then examine or inspect what is contained in the conclusion in\nsearch of a more general truth from which the conclusion follows.\nAlthough the Logic does not explicitly state that formal\nrules for syllogisms should be valued less than the analytic method,\nit is clear that this is what the authors had in mind when saying that\nthe only point in learning formal rules for syllogisms is obtaining\nmental exercise. Synthetic demonstrations are cheap because whenever\none has successfully performed an analysis, one is trivially in\npossession of a synthesis as well. The methods of analysis and\nsynthesis,\n\ndiffer only as the route one takes in climbing a mountain from a\nvalley differs from the route taken in descending from the mountain to\nthe valley, or as the two ways differ that are used to prove that a\nperson is descended from St. Louis. One way is to show that this\nperson had a certain man for a father who was the son of a certain\nman, and that man was the son of another, and so on up to St. Louis.\nThe other way is to begin with St. Louis and show that he had a\ncertain child, and this child had others, thereby descending to the\nperson in question (IV.2, 238)\n\nThe analogy is that if a proposition (or a genealogy) is unknown, then\none ascends to more general truths (the ancestor), but if the\nproposition (or the genealogy) is known, then one descends to the\nconclusion (the descendants). In other words, the analysis and the\nsynthesis of an item is just the same demonstration, the only\ndifference being the route or direction, i.e., whether one begins or\nends with the proposition in question (Rogers & Nelson 2015). This\nalso makes clear the sense in which method is a matter of ordering\nknowledge. In analysis one puts the conclusion first in the order and\nproceeds to find the truths that it contains. Synthesis reverses this\nbeginning with propositions that are already known and then\nunderstanding that the conclusion follows.\n\nChapters 3\u201310 are concerned in one way or another with axiomatic\npresentations of geometry. This is understandable given the reputation\nof Euclid\u2019s Elements as a model of rigorous reasoning\nand certain results. It is interesting therefore that the\nLogic also, while acknowledging the virtues of the work of\nEuclid and other geometers, offers some pointed criticisms. Applying\nlogical method to geometry was among Arnauld\u2019s many special\ninterests. He wrote a book entitled, New Elements of Geometry\n(1667) in which he attempted to remedy the faults discussed here in\nPart IV of the Logic. The authors treatment begins with some\nrules for synthetic demonstrations, especially in geometry. There are\nno surprises here. Terms must be scrupulously defined; propositions\nthat are taken to be axiomatic must be completely certain, and so on.\nAs stated, the rules might appear obvious, but they are elaborated in\na decidedly Cartesian way. The point of rules for definitions, for\nexample, is to ensure that linguistic terms become precisely\nassociated with distinct ideas. It follows that definitions\nwill be useless for those who do not have prior access to the ideas in\nquestion. Regarding rules for axioms, the main point that emerges is\nthat they must be distinctly perceived in the Cartesian sense put\nforward in Part I on ideas and Part II on propositions. This means\nthat axioms derive from innate resources and not from sensory\nexperience and that attributes must be clearly and distinctly\nperceived as included in subjects. It also means that no sincere\nskeptical questions can arise from properly chosen axioms. A good deal\nof Part IV recapitulates Descartes\u2019 unfinished manuscript,\nRules for the Direction of the Native Intellect (c. 1628).\nThis was unpublished in Latin until after the fifth edition of the\nLogic, but Arnauld had access to at least part of some\nversion of the manuscript. Chapter 7 offers as examples of \u201csome\nimportant axioms\u201d others provided by Descartes in his replies to\nthe second set of objections to the Meditations (CSM II,\n116\u2013117).\n\nThe rules for synthetic demonstrations lead to a list of criticisms of\n\u201cgeometers\u201d. Chapter 4 notes some equivocations in\nEuclid\u2019s use of \u201cangle\u201d, \u201cratio\u201d, and\n\u201cproportion.\u201d Later mathematicians are criticizes for not\nrespecting the distinction between nominal and real definitions. The\nformer should be stipulations about how words are associated with\nideas. The latter should characterize the nature of the object being\ndefined. Examples are given about disputes among prominent\nmathematicians over nominal definitions as if they were real (IV.5).\nAnother mistake the authors find geometers making is \u201cproving\nthings that do not need to be proved\u201d (IV.9, 254). This mistake\nis attributed to inattention to the connection between truth and clear\nand distinct perception. Euclid proves that that any two sides of a\ntriangle are greater than the third side. Because this is immediately\nevident, the proof violates method by mis-ordering what is known.\nAnother mistake Euclid makes in ordering is tacking back and forth\nfrom more general to more specific cases; a number of examples are\nprovided. Proper order requires always moving from more simple items\nto more complex ones. A more significant disagreement with geometrical\npractice is about indirect proofs by reductio ad absurdum.\nBecause the denial of a true proposition is always confused, the\nderivation of a contradiction will usually offer no insight into why\nthe conclusion is true (IV.9, 255\u201356). It is conceded, however,\nthat indirect proofs might be necessary when no direct proof can be\nfound, and they can be useful when a result is already obtained\ndirectly.\n\nThe Logic ends in a way befitting a treatise associated with\nthe Port-Royal abbey. The last four chapters consider how to fit into\nthe method the deliverances of knowledge derived from authority\ninstead of from reason. Knowledge from authority is of two kinds:\nknowledge from God, which is called faith, and knowledge from humans\n\u201cworthy of credence\u201d, which is called belief or opinion\n(IV.12, 260). God\u2019s deliverances are infallible, but human\nauthorities differ in their reliability. The best opinions come from\nthe constant testimony of many sources. These can reach moral\ncertainty, i.e., all the certainty that is required for practical\npurposes. Faith and opinion are, however, underwritten by reason\nbecause, according to the authors, reason reveals that God is\ninfallible and that skepticism about reliable human authority is\ngroundless.\n\nThere follow some commonsensical rules for handling opinions. For\nexample, for a proposition to be accepted as true, it need not be\nnecessary and the possibility of a proposition\u2019s truth should\nnot automatically lead to its acceptance. These rules are applied to\nevaluating claims of miracles. One should take care to evaluate all of\nthe available evidence before accepting a particular claim.\nOutstanding authorities should be generally trusted. The miracles\nrelated by Augustine, for example, will be accepted as such by\n\u201ca person of good sense\u201d (IV.14, 267). In Chapter 15, the\ncommonsensical principles for evaluating testimony are applied to some\ncases of then current interest regarding the disputed authorship of\nvarious letters and texts. Chapter 16 concludes the Logic\nwith the topic of judgments regarding the future. The authors point\nout that it is a common error to overemphasize great future harms or\nbenefits when these outcomes are very unlikely and to underemphasize\nsmall harms or benefits that are very likely or repeatable. Infinite\nbenefits require a different strategy. The observation that the\nauthors view as most important is the case made famous by fellow\nJansenist, Blaise Pascal.\n\nOnly infinite things such as eternity and salvation cannot be equalled\nby any temporal benefit. Thus we ought never balance them off against\nanything worldly. This is why the slightest bit of help for acquiring\nsalvation is worth more than all the goods of the world taken\ntogether. And the least peril of being lost is more important than all\ntemporal harms considered merely as harms.\n\nThat is enough to make all reasonable people draw this conclusion with\nwhich we will end this Logic: that the greatest of all\nfollies is to use one\u2019s time and life for something other than\nwhat may be useful for acquiring a life that will never end, since all\nthe goods and harms of this life are nothing in comparison to those of\nthe other life, and the danger of falling into those harms, as well as\nthe difficulty of acquiring these goods, is very great (IV.16,\n275)\n\nThe book\u2019s conclusion one again stresses that formal logic and\neven science are at best instrumental to the goal of living well.\n",
