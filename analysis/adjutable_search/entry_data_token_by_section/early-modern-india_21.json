TS 47). It\nis alleged by the Naiy\u0101yikas that any piece of perceptual\nknowledge must be of this form, and further that most cases\nin which we claim just to be seeing an object (e.g. \u201cI see the\ncar\u201d) are really cases of seeing something as a car. In a\n\u2018qualificative\u2019 perception, it is the qualificand which is\nin sensory connection with the perceiver. How then does the qualifier\nenter the picture? The Ny\u0101ya claim that:\n\nPrinciple 2: In every case of perception, the\nqualifier is a previously perceived entity (substance, quality, motion\nor universal) which is recalled by the perceiver and\n\u2018superimposed\u2019 upon the qualificand.\n\n\nThe intuitive idea is that the qualifying feature is a concept,\nempirically acquired by the perceiver, and now used to categorise the\nobject perceived. To see that the passing animal is a horse, one must\nfirst possess the concept horse, by means of previous\nacquaintance with the type. (Use of the term \u2018concept\u2019\nhere does not imply that the features are in any sense\nsubjective\u2014for the Ny\u0101ya they are objective entities or\nconstructions out of objective entities). The Ny\u0101ya thus use\ntheir theory of memory (initial experience causing dispositional trace\ncausing memory event) as a theory of concept-possession.\n\nPrinciple 2 has a number of consequences:\n\nIf every case of seeing an object a as f is\npreceded by a prior perception of f, and if that prior\nperception were itself of f as qualified by some qualifier\ng, we would get an infinite regress. The Ny\u0101ya (cf. TS\n47) therefore state that, in addition to qualificative perceptions,\nthere are also \u2018non-qualificative\u2019 (nirvikalpaka =\nni\u1e63prak\u0101raka) perceptual experiences. In such\nexperiences, on sees both the object and its qualifier, but not as\nbeing qualified by the qualifier.\nTo illustrate the general theory, suppose I perceive for the first\ntime a vase having a particular shade of blue which I have never\nbefore seen. The theory states that, prior to seeing the vase as being\nqualified by that shade, I first see the vase, together with (but not\nqualified by) the shade, and then, recalling that shade, impose it\nupon the vase.\nPerceptual illusions, hallucinations, etc., are all explained as\ncases in which a wrong feature is recalled from memory (or the concept\nbank). Suppose I misperceive the coiled object in the corner as being\na snake. The account given by the Ny\u0101ya is that I recall and\nsuperimpose the feature snakehood, on the basis presumably of its\nclose similarity with the true feature ropehood. Similarly, if I\nhallucinate a dagger, the account entails that I am superimposing the\nmemory of some previously encountered dagger upon the region of space\nin front of me (there must be some qualificand, by Principle\n1). This is called the \u2018mislocation\u2019\n(anyath\u0101khy\u0101ti) theory of perceptual error. Note\nthat, if all error is a product of qualifier-mislocation, then no\nerror is possible with respect to the qualificand with which one is in\nsensory connection. Note too that the Ny\u0101ya make no appeal to\n\u2018images\u2019, \u2018ideas\u2019 or any other subjective\ncontent to explain illusion\u2014it is an externalist account of\nerror. This shows that the so-called argument from illusion, from the\nphenomenal indistinguishability of veridical and non-veridical\nperceptual experiences to their having a shared subjective content, is\nfalse. It is not clear, however, that one can always find a suitable\nqualificand (is a region of space really perceived in a\nhallucination?) or a suitable qualifier (e.g. when one sees a stick as\nbent, because partially submerged in water, where does the feature\n\u2018being bent thus\u2019 come from?\u2014the Ny\u0101ya actually\nclaim that it is an objective feature causally produced by the act of\nperceiving!)\nThis theory allows the Ny\u0101ya to say that locutions like\n\u201cI see (visually) that the air is cold\u201d or \u201cI see\nthat the mango is sweet\u201d, in which the qualifier, though\nperceptible is not a visible property, are genuine cases of\nperception. They classify them as a type of\n\u2018extra-ordinary\u2019 perception, called\nj\u00f1\u0101na-lak\u1e63a\u1e47\u0101-praty\u0101satti.\n(The other types of extra-ordinary perception sometimes admitted are\n\u2018s\u0101m\u0101nyalak\u1e63a\u1e47a\u2019, in which\nall the bearers of a property are perceived by perceiving the\nproperty, and yogic perception.)\nThe Ny\u0101ya state that experience amounts to a\nknowledge-episode when and only when it is true, i.e. when the\nqualifier actually qualifies the qualificand. The Manual of\nReason (TS 69 iii) says that the gu\u1e47a or special\ncausal factor for perceptual knowledge when the qualifier imposed by\nthe perceiver onto the sensorily connected qualificand is actually\npresent in the qualificand. There may, however, be scope for\nGettier-style counter-examples to this definition.\n\n",
