    "main_text": "\n\n\nIn its most expansive sense, Latin American philosophy is philosophy\nproduced in Latin America or philosophy produced by persons of Latin\nAmerican ancestry who reside outside of Latin America. It is typically\ntaken to exclude philosophy produced in non-Iberian former colonies,\nwith the occasional exception of former French colonies in the\nCaribbean. Other names have also been used to refer to the whole or\npart of Latin American philosophy, including Spanish American, Hispanic\nAmerican, Iberoamerican, and Latino/a philosophy. The first two refer\nspecifically to the philosophy of former Spanish colonies, the third to\nthat of former Iberian colonies, and the fourth to the philosophy\nproduced in the United States by descendants of Latin Americans.\n\n\nLatin American philosophy is usually taken to have originated around\n1550, when Spanish conquerors founded the first schools in Latin\nAmerica and began to teach and publish philosophical treatises.\nRecently, there has been an effort on the part of historians to\ninclude pre-Columbian thought in Latin American philosophy, although\nthe pre-Columbian texts cited are often fragmentary and religious in\ntone and intention. In terms of traditions, style, and influence,\npost-Columbian Latin American philosophy is part of the Western\nphilosophical tradition. Indeed, philosophical discussions in Latin\nAmerica have and continue to be dominated by European philosophical\ninfluences. Even those Latin American philosophers who have endeavored\nto develop original theories have frequently framed their own\ncontributions in the terms of European thinkers. Partly in response to\nthis phenomenon, there has arisen a large body of literature concerned\nwith the identity, authenticity, and originality of Latin American\nphilosophy.\n\n\nLatin American philosophy has been both original and derivative. Much\nof its history involves work that is derivative of European\nphilosophical figures and movements. At the same, time Latin American\nphilosophy has produced important philosophers, original approaches to\nold philosophical problems, and formulations of new problems not\nalready within the European philosophical tradition. Moreover,\nvirtually all historical European philosophical traditions have been\npresent in Latin America, as are most contemporary movements in the\nUnited States and Europe. Finally, there has been a significant\ninterest in social concerns among Latin American philosophers, partly\nas a reaction to the social and economic circumstances of Latin\nAmerica. This has led Latin American philosophical work to be\ncomparatively more concerned with social issues than philosophy in,\nfor example, the United States.\n\n\nThe influence of Latin American philosophy outside of Latin America\nhas thus far been relatively small. Although the situation has been\nimproving, very few Latin American philosophers are currently read\noutside of Latin America. This situation is made worse by the paucity\nof English-language translations of Latin American philosophical\nworks. Moreover, internal to Latin America, philosophers read and\nrespond to each other with less frequency than one might expect or\nwish. However, the philosophy of liberation has had some impact both\nin North America and in developing countries in Africa, and Latinos/as\nhave participated actively in the discussion of a variety of topics,\nespecially those having to do with race, ethnicity, and social\nidentities in the United States. In the past few years, some of these\nphilosophers have occupied positions of leadership in the\nphilosophical establishment and their work has been the subject of\ndiscussion by prominent non-Latino/a philosophers.\n\n\nThis article is divided into three main parts: history, the\ncontemporary period, and problems and topics. We begin with a sketch of\nthe history of Latin American philosophy.\n",
