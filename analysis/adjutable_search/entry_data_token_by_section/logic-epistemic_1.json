    "main_text": "The Modal Approach to Knowledge\n2. The Modal Approach to Knowledge\n\nUntil relatively recently, epistemic logic focused almost exclusively\non propositional knowledge. In cases of propositional knowledge, an\nagent or a group of agents bears the propositional attitude of knowing\ntowards some proposition. For example, when one says: \u201cZoe knows\nthat there is a hen in the yard\u201d, one asserts that Zoe is the\nagent who bears the propositional attitude knowing towards\nthe proposition expressed by the English sentence \u201cthere is a\nhen in the yard\u201d. Now imagine that Zoe does not know whether\nthere is a hen in the yard. For example, it might be the case that she\nhas no access to information about whether there is or is not a hen in\nthe yard. In this case her lack of information means that she will\nconsider two scenarios as being possible, one in which there is a hen\nin the yard and one in which there is not.\n\nPerhaps she has some practical decision that involves not only hens\nbut also the presence of frightening dogs in the yard. She might wish\nto feed the hens but will only do so if there is no dog in the yard.\nIf she were ignorant of whether there is a dog in the yard, the number\nof scenarios she must consider in her deliberations grows to four.\nClearly, one needs to consider epistemic alternatives when one does\nnot have complete information concerning the situations that are\nrelevant to one\u2019s decisions. As we shall see below, possible\nworlds semantics has provided a useful framework for understanding the\nmanner in which agents can reason about epistemic alternatives.\n\nWhile epistemic logicians had traditionally focused on knowing\nthat, one finds a range of other uses of knowledge in natural\nlanguage. As Y. Wang (2018b) points out, the expressions knowing\nhow, knowing what, knowing why are very common,\nappearing almost just as frequently (sometimes more frequently) in\nspoken and written language as knowing that. Recently\nnon-standard epistemic logics of such know-wh expressions have been\ndeveloped, to which we will come back in\n Section 4.\n In the remainder of this section, we will introduce the basics of the\nepistemic logic of knowing that.\n",
