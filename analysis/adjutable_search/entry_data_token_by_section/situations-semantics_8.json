    "main_text": "Exemplification and exhaustive interpretations\n9. Situation semantics and Davidsonian event semantics\n\nSituations and events seem to be the same kinds of things. If\nsituations are particulars, so are events. If situations are built\nfrom relations and individuals standing in those relations, so are\nevents. We don\u2019t seem to need both of those things. We\ndon\u2019t seem to need both situation semantics and Davidsonian\nevent semantics (see entries\n Donald Davidson\n and\n events).\n\nThe core of a Davidsonian event semantics are predications like the\nfollowing:\n\n(58)\nswim(Ewan)(e)\n\n\n(58) is the classical Davidsonian formalization of the tenseless\nsentence Ewan swim. The predication in (58) is standardly\nread as \u201ce is a swim by Ewan\u201d. Crucially, this\nformula is not understood as \u2018e is an event that\ncontains a swim by Ewan\u2019 or as \u201ce is an event\nin which Ewan is swimming\u201d. In other words, unlike the\nbasic predications in situation semantics, Davidsonian basic\npredications have a built-in minimality condition. This is a major\ndifference between situation semantics and Davidsonian event\nsemantics, maybe the difference. Without the minimality\ncondition, we couldn\u2019t do many things we want to do with a\nDavidsonian semantics. As an illustration, consider the following\nexample:\n\n(59)\n\n\na.\nEwan swam for 10 hours.\nb.\n\u2203e [swim(Ewan)(e) &\nfhour(e) = 10]\n \n\n\nIf the simple predication swim(Ewan)(e) in 59(b) could be\nunderstood as \u201ce is an event in which Ewan\nswims\u201d, then 59(b) could describe an event where Ewan swam for\njust five minutes, but a lot of other things went on as well in that\nevent: He rode his bike, his sister slept, his mother harvested\nshallots, his father irrigated fields, and taken together, those\nactivities took a total of 10 hours. 59(a) doesn\u2019t describe\nevents of this kind, hence 59(b) couldn\u2019t be a formalization of\n59(a). The standard way of understanding 59(b) is as saying that there\nwas a swim by Ewan that took 10 hours.\n\nBut what is a swim by Ewan? A swim is typically a self-connected\nsituation in which someone is swimming, and which is\n\u201cminimal\u201d in a sense that it excludes other activities\nlike riding a bike, sleeping or farm work. It doesn\u2019t exclude\nparts of the actual swimming, like movement of arms and legs. Most\nimportantly, a swim by Ewan doesn\u2019t literally have to\nbe a minimal situation in which Ewan is swimming, which would be a\nvery short swim, if there are minimal swimming situations at all. The\nrelevant notion of minimality is by now familiar: a swim by Ewan is a\nsituation that exemplifies the proposition \u201cEwan is\nswimming\u201d. This suggests that the exemplification relation can\nbe used to actually define basic Davidsonian event predications within\na situation semantics. The exemplification relation relates possibly\nvery complex sentences to their exemplifying situations. Davidsonian\nevent predications emerge as those special cases where the sentences\nthat are related to exemplifying situations are atomic.\n\nIf verbs have an event argument, as Davidson proposed, then simple\nsentences consisting of a verb and its arguments always involve\nDavidsonian event predication, and hence exemplification. Importing\nDavidsonian event semantics into situation semantics, the proposition\nexpressed by 59(a), for example, might be formalized as follows:\n\n(60)\n\u03bbs [past(s) & \u2203e\n[e \u2264p s &\nswim(Ewan)(e) & fhour(e) =\n10] ]\n\n\nThe formula in (60) incorporates the usual notation for Davidsonian\nevent predication. Within a situation semantics, this notation is just\na convenient way to convey that swim(Ewan)(e) is to be\ninterpreted in terms of exemplification: we are not talking about\nsituations in which Ewan swims, but about situations that exemplify\nthe proposition \u201cEwan swims\u201d.\n\nIf Davidsonian event predication is part of the antecedent of a\nconditional, exemplification may come in more than once when\ndetermining the situations the conditional quantifies over. This is\ncrucial for examples like (61):\n\n(61)\nWhenever a man rides a donkey, the man gives a treat to the\ndonkey.\n\n\n(61) quantifies over situations that contain just one man and just one\ndonkey, but it does not seem to quantify over minimal donkey rides.\nThere is no pressure to keep the rides short and multiply the treats\naccordingly. A single shift from descriptions of merely verifying to\nexemplifying situations would not yield the correct quantification\ndomain for (61). If we tried to keep the situations small enough so as\nto contain no more than a single man and a single donkey we would have\nto keep the rides short as well. However, if the antecedent of (61)\ncontains Davidsonian event quantification, we can keep the situations\nquantified over small enough to prevent the presence of more than one\nman or donkey, but still big enough to contain complete donkey rides.\nThe proposition expressed by the antecedent of (61) would be (62):\n\n(62)\n\u03bbs \u2203x \u2203y\n[man(x)(s) & donkey(y)(s)\n& \u2203e [e \u2264p\ns & ride(y)(x)(e)] ]\n\n\nIf the domain for the event quantifier in (62) is established on the\nbasis of some suitable counting criterion, it could quantify over\nmaximal spatiotemporally connected donkey rides. The proposition in\n(62) can then be exemplified by minimal situations that contain a\nsingle man x and a single donkey y and a maximal\nspatiotemporally connected event of riding y by\nx.\n\nThe goal of bringing together situation semantics and Davidsonian\nevent semantics, at least in certain areas, is pursued in a number of\nworks, including Lasersohn (1988, 1990), Zucchi (1988), Portner\n(1992), Cooper (1997), and Kratzer (1998).\n",
