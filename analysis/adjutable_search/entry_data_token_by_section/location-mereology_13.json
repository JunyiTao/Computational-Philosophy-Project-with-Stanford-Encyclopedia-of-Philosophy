    "main_text": "Extended Simples || For Extended Simples #3: from Recombination\n5.3 For Extended Simples #3: from Recombination\n\nAs we noted in\n Section 4.4,\n Sider, McDaniel, and Saucedo have argued for the possibility of\ninterpenetration by appeal to principles of recombination. They have\nalso marshaled these principles in support of the possibility of\nextended simples (Sider 2007; McDaniel 2007b; Saucedo 2011). Here is\nthe core of McDaniel's argument:\n\n\n(NNC): Let F and G be accidental, intrinsic properties;\nlet R be a fundamental relation; let x and y be\ncontingently existing non-overlapping entities. Then it is not the\ncase that, necessarily, Rxy only if\n(Fx if and only if Gy)\u2026if we accept\nthe Humean premise that there are no necessary connections between the\naccidental, intrinsic properties of regions of space and the\naccidental, intrinsic properties of material objects, then we should\nhold that there are no necessary connections between the mereological\nstructure of a material object and the mereological structure of the\nregion it occupies. Specifically, it is not true that, necessarily, a\nmaterial object is a simple if and only if it occupies a simple (read:\npointsized) region of spacetime. It follows that extended material\nsimples are possible. (2007b: 135\u2013137)\n\n\nIf we let o and r be contingently existing,\nnon-overlapping entities, then McDaniel's argument can be\nreconstructed as follows:\n\n(3)\nExact location is a fundamental relation.\n(4)\nbeing simple is an accidental, intrinsic\nproperty.\n(5)\nbeing a simple region is an accidental\nintrinsic property.\n(6)\nObject o and region r are contingently existing,\nnon-overlapping entities.\n(7)\nFor any accidental, intrinsic properties F and G,\nany fundamental relation R, and any contingently existing\nnon-overlapping entities x and y, it is not the case\nthat, necessarily if Rxy then (if Fx then\n Gy).[8]\nTherefore\n(8)\nIt is not the case that necessarily, if o is exactly\nlocated at r, then: if o is simple then r is a\nsimple region.\n\n\nSupersubstantivalists will deny that exact location is a fundamental\nrelation. Others might take aim at McDaniel's recombination principle.\nLet F be the property being round and let\nG be the property not being square. These may seem to\nbe accidental and intrinsic. But if they are, and if exact location is\nfundamental, then McDaniel's principle tells us that it is possible\nfor a round object to be exactly located at a square region, which\nsome might take as a reductio of (7). McDaniel (2007b) and\nSkow (2007), however, take this to show that the given shapes are not\nintrinsic properties. For a more detailed discussion of recombination\nprinciples such as (7), and a defense of the view that shapes are\nintrinsic, see Kleinschmidt (2015).\n\nFor further arguments in favor of extended simples, including a more\ndetailed recombination argument, see Section 2.1 of the supplementary\ndocument\n Additional Arguments.\n",
