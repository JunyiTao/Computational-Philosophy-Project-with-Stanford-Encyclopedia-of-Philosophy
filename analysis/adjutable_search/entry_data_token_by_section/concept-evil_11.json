    "main_text": "Contemporary Theories of Evil Action || Evil and Harm\n3.2 Evil and Harm\n\nMost theorists writing about the concept of evil believe that evil\nactions must cause or allow significant harm to at least one victim\n(see, e.g., Card 2002; Kekes 2005; Veltlesen 2005; Calder 2013 and\n2019; Formosa 2013 and 2019; Goldberg 2019). However, three sorts of\narguments have been used to contest this claim.\n\nFirst, some theorists argue that evil actions need not cause or allow\nsignificant harm because we can perform evil actions by attempting (or\nseriously risking) to cause harm, even if we fail. For example, on\nthis view, it would be evil to attempt to detonate a bomb in a room\nfull of innocent people, even if the attempt is thwarted by the police\n(See Kramer 2011, 204\u2013205; Russell 2014 52\u201353; Formosa\n2019, 263\u2013262).\n\nSecond, some theorists argue that evil actions need not cause or allow\nsignificant harm because we can perform evil actions by merely taking\npleasure in a victim\u2019s suffering (Calder 2002, 56; Garrard 2002,\n327; Kramer 2011, 211; Formosa 2019, 262\u2013263). For instance, imagine\nthat Alex takes pleasure in witnessing Carol\u2019s extreme\nsuffering, but that Alex does not cause Carol\u2019s suffering. Some\npeople would call this act of sadistic voyeurism evil even though it\ncauses no additional harm to the victim (we can imagine that Carol is\nnot aware that Alex takes pleasure in her suffering so that the\nwitnessing of her suffering does not aggravate the harm). \n\nTheorists who believe that cases of failed attempts and/or sadistic\nvoyeurism show that evil actions need not cause or allow significant\nharm nevertheless tend to believe that evil actions must be connected\nin an appropriate way to significant harm (See, e.g., Kramer 2011,\n203\u2013223; Russell 2007, 676; Formosa 2019, 262\u2013265). However,\nothers dispute this contention. These theorists argue instead that\nthere can be cases of \u201csmall-scale evil\u201d where evil\nactions involve very little or no harm (De Wijze 2018; Garrard 1998\nand 2002; Morton 2004, 60). These cases constitute the third sort of\nargument against the claim that evil actions must cause or allow\nsignificant harm. For example Eve Garrard has suggested that\nschoolyard bullies perform evil actions even though they do not cause\nvery much harm (Garrard 1998, 45), while Stephen de Wijze has argued\nthat torturing and killing what you know to be a lifelike robot would\nbe evil even if the robot has no conscious life (De Wijze 2018,\n34).\n\nTwo sorts of responses can be given to these sorts of cases. First, we\ncan argue that, while the action in question is evil, it does, in\nfact, involve significant harm. This sort of response seems\nappropriate for the bullying case (See Kramer 2011, 218). Second, we\ncan argue that, while the action in question wouldn\u2019t be\nharmful, it wouldn\u2019t be evil either. This sort of response seems\nappropriate for the robot case.\n\nFurthermore, in response to all three arguments for the claim that\nevil actions need not cause or allow significant harm (i.e. failed\nattempts, sadistic voyeurs, and small-scale evil), we can argue that\ntheorists who deploy these arguments confuse evil actions with evil\ncharacters. For example, we can argue that failed attempts seem evil\nbecause attempting to perform an evil action is an indication that the\nagent performing the action has an evil character and not because the\naction itself is evil (See Calder 2015a, 121). Similarly, we can argue\nthat given their intentions, motives, and feelings, sadistic voyeurs\nand robot torturers are evil persons even though they do not perform\nevil actions (for more about evil character see Section 4).\n\nAssuming that harm is an essential component of evil, the question\nthen becomes how much, or what type of, harm is required for evil? In\nthe Roots of Evil John Kekes argues that the harm of evil\nmust be serious and excessive (Kekes 2005, 1\u20133). In an earlier\nwork, Kekes specifies that a serious harm is one that\n\u201cinterferes with the functioning of a person as a full-fledged\nagent.\u201d (Kekes 1998, 217). Claudia Card describes the harm of\nevil as an intolerable harm. By an intolerable harm, Card means a harm\nthat makes life not worth living from the point of view of the person\nwhose life it is. Examples of intolerable harms include severe\nphysical or mental suffering as well as the deprivation of basics such\nas food, clean drinking water, and social contact (Card 2002, 16).\nAccording to Paul Formosa, evil actions involve significant harms,\nwhich are typically instantiated by life-ending, life-wrecking, or\nseverely autonomy impairing harms (Formosa 2013 and 2019). (For\nfurther discussion of the harm component see Russell 2014,\n64\u201368).\n",
