    "main_text": "Medieval Empiricism || A Cognitive Empiricism\n5. Conclusion\n\nThose sympathetic to empiricism may be inclined to portray this\nhistory as a progress from darkness to light. But a moment\u2019s\nreflection suggests it deserves a more cautious evaluation. These\nancient and medieval thinkers certainly laid the foundations on which\nearly modern and modern empiricists would build. But they also\nbequeathed a series of problems, some of which have never been\nsatisfactorily resolved.\n\nThere are, first of all, the problems faced by the Epicureans, who\nwere genetic but not explanatory empiricists, favouring the atomist\ntheory of Leucippus and Democritus. As Democritus seems to have\nrealized, while the atomist doctrine can be supported by observable\nfacts (such as the fact of motion), once formulated it seems to\nundercut a belief in the reliability of such observations. At the very\nleast, it suggests a distinction between what would later be called\n\u201cprimary\u201d and \u201csecondary\u201d qualities, narrowing\nthe range of the kind of experiences to which natural philosophers\nwould appeal.\n\nThe Epicureans also seem to have come up against another enduring\nproblem: that of the underdetermination of theory by data. If the\nsenses cannot directly \u201cbear witness\u201d to the existence of\nwhat cannot be observed, being able only to bear witness against it,\nthere may be a number of apparently equally acceptable hypotheses\nabout the unobservable. One could argue, as Epicureans seem to have\ndone, that these should all be regarded as true, in the sense of being\nrealized somewhere and at some time. But this seems unsatisfactory\nwhen it comes to explaining particular events.\n\nMore broadly, there is the problem of just what experience can show.\nCan experience be a source of mathematical or logical knowledge? Can\nit reveal the causal relations that are traditionally regarded as the\ngoal of science? Aristotle, as we saw, seems to have held that the\nmind has the power of identifying the causal powers that belong to\nparticular kinds of entities. But it was never clear that experience\nalone could achieve such an insight. Medieval discussions of the\n\u201cagent intellect\u201d tended to regard it as an external\npower, or, at least, a human faculty that participates in a divine\nlight. Thinkers such as Henry of Ghent went further, embracing the\nAugustinian idea that an act of divine illumination is required on\neach occasion we attain such insights. Under the impact of\nAristotelian naturalism this idea was abandoned, but without (it must\nbe said) any clear alternative.\n\nLater empiricists could (and did) follow Ockham in denying that there\nare universals to be discovered; they professed to be undisturbed by\nthe fact that we cannot grasp the \u201creal essences\u201d of the\nobjects we perceive (Locke Essay 3.6.9). But the problems of\nempiricism did not go away. Even one of the empiricist\u2019s\nfavorite ideas\u2014the \u201ccovering law\u201d account of\nscientific explanation\u2014assumes we can arrive at true\ngeneralizations, propositions that apply to all members of a\nparticular class. But for those who take Ockham\u2019s nominalism to\nits logical conclusion, a law of nature can be nothing more than a\ncontingently true proposition. Since the similarities that fix class\nmembership have no metaphysical grounding, not being based on a shared\nnature, we cannot know the truth of the law by any kind of rational\ninsight. The only way of testing such a proposition is by observation.\nIt is at this point that there arises the \u201cproblem of\ninduction,\u201d first discussed by Sextus Empiricus and picked up by\nNicholas of Autrecourt, but made famous in the eighteenth century by\nDavid Hume.\n\nIn our own time, the wheel has turned. On the one hand, talk of\n\u201cessences\u201d and necessary truths has become fashionable\nagain, at least in some circles (Haldane 2018). In particular, if we\nwant to distinguish laws of nature from accidental generalizations,\ncontingently true propositions do not seem sufficient for science.\nLaws of nature on this view must embody modal knowledge, particularly\nas this relates to contrary-to-fact conditionals (Armstrong 1978:\n274). This brings us back to Aristotle, for his conception of\nscientific knowledge (epist\u0113m\u0113) involved knowing\nthat given a posited cause, the fact to be explained cannot be\notherwise (APo. 71b11). The problem for the empiricist is:\nHow can sense perception yield modal knowledge of this kind? On the\nother hand, William of Ockham\u2019s nominalism can be thought to\nanticipate the work of contemporary thinkers who would \u201clower\nthe bar\u201d (as it were), no longer demanding that we gain\nknowledge of what is necessarily the case. Taken to its logical\nconclusion, Ockham\u2019s view can be thought to hold that the\n\u201cuniversals\u201d that were the goal of Aristotelian science\nare no more than \u201csets of competencies in classifying things\ntogether\u201d, which have no grounding outside the practices in\nwhich we engage (King 2003: 225). (For a less sceptical reading of\nOckham, see Colvert 2000: 265.) Is a radical nominalism of this kind\ntenable? The question has not yet been answered.\n\nThis article began with the observation that we should not approach\nancient thinkers in a \u201cWhiggish\u201d fashion; nor should we\nforce their thought into modern categories. But what this history\nshows is that there is no need to do so. Once we understand what these\nthinkers were saying, we can see that we are still grappling with the\nissues they raised.\n",
