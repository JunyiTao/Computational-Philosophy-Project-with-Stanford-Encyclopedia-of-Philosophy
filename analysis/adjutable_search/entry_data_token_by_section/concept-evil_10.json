    "main_text": "Contemporary Theories of Evil Action || Evil and Wrongdoing\n3.1 Evil and Wrongdoing\n\nMost philosophers, and laypeople, assume that wrongfulness is an\nessential component of evil action (See e.g., Card 2002, Garrard 1998,\nFormosa 2008). It seems that, to be evil, an action must, at least, be\nwrong. However, this claim is not universally accepted (Calder 2013).\nThe central question for most theorists is: what more is required for\nevil than mere wrongdoing? One controversial answer to this question\nis that nothing more is required: an evil action is just a very\nwrongful action (Russell 2007 and 2014). This position is resisted by\nmost evil-revivalists who claim instead that evil is qualitatively,\nrather than merely quantitatively, distinct from mere wrongdoing (See,\ne.g., Steiner 2002; Garrard 1998 and 2002; Calder 2013 and\n2019).\n\nTo determine whether evil is qualitatively distinct from mere\nwrongdoing we must first understand what it is for two concepts to be\nqualitatively distinct. According to some theorists two concepts are\nqualitatively distinct if, and only if, all instantiations of the\nfirst concept share a property which no instantiation of the second\nconcept shares (Steiner 2002; Garrard 1998, 2002; Russell, 2007). For\ninstance, Hillel Steiner claims that \u201cevil acts are\ndistinguished from ordinary wrongs through the presence of an extra\nquality that is completely absent in the performance of ordinary\nwrongs\u201d (Steiner 2002, 184). According to Steiner, the extra\nquality shared by all evil actions and lacking from merely wrongful\nactions, is the perpetrator\u2019s pleasure; evil action consists in\ntaking pleasure in doing wrong. No merely wrongful action is\npleasurable for its doer (for more about Steiner\u2019s theory of\nevil see Section 3.4).\n\nTodd Calder (2013) disputes this understanding of what it is for two\nconcepts to be qualitatively distinct, arguing instead that two\nconcepts are qualitatively distinct provided they do not share all of\ntheir essential properties. Thus, evil actions are qualitatively\ndistinct from merely wrongful actions provided the essential\nproperties of evil actions are not also the essential properties of\nmerely wrongful actions but had to a greater degree.\n\nCalder argues that on plausible theories of evil and wrongdoing, evil\nand wrongdoing do not share all of their essential properties, and\nthus, evil and wrongdoing are qualitatively distinct. For instance,\nCalder argues that it is an essential property of evil actions that\nthe evildoer intends that his victim suffer significant harm while it\nis not an essential property of wrongful actions that the wrongdoer\nintend to cause harm. For instance, cheating, lying, and risky\nbehaviour can be wrongful even if the wrongdoer does not intend to\ncause harm (Calder 2013).\n\nHallie Liberto and Fred Harrington go even further than Calder in\narguing that two concepts can be non-quantitatively distinct even\nthough instantiations of the two concepts share properties (Liberto\nand Harrington 2016). According to Liberto and Harrington, two\nconcepts are non-quantitatively distinct provided one of the concepts\nhas a property which determines the degree to which that concept is\ninstantiated that does not determine the degree to which the second\nconcept is instantiated. For instance, Liberto and Harrington suggest\nthat both altruistic and heroic actions have the following essential\nproperties: (1) they are performed for the sake of others, and (2)\nthey are performed at some cost or risk to the agent. However, the\ndegree to which an action is altruistic is determined by the degree to\nwhich it is performed for the sake of others (and not by the degree to\nwhich it is performed at some cost or risk to the agent) while the\ndegree to which an action is heroic is determined by the degree to\nwhich it is performed at some cost or risk to the agent (and not by\nthe degree to which it is performed for the sake of others). They call\nthis form of concept distinctness \u201cquality of emphasis\ndistinctness\u201d (Liberto and Harrington 2016, 1595).\n\nImportantly, if Liberto and Harrington are right that two concepts can\nbe non-quantitatively distinct by being quality of emphasis distinct,\nthen Calder is wrong to think that two concepts can be\nnon-quantitatively distinct only if they do not share all of their\nessential properties. Liberto and Harrington argue further that evil\nand wrongdoing are non-quantitatively distinct in the sense of being\nquality of emphasis distinct. Consider, for example, Claudia\nCard\u2019s theory of evil according to which \u201cevil is\nreasonably foreseeable intolerable harm, produced by inexcusable\nwrongs\u201d (Card 2010, 16). Liberto and Harrington argue that using\nthis theory we could say that degrees of evil are determined by\ndegrees of harm, while degrees of wrongdoing are not. If so, evil and\nwrongdoing are non-quantitatively distinct by being quality of\nemphasis distinct. (For a rebuttal of Liberto\u2019s and Harrington\u2019s\nquality of emphasis account of non-quantitative distinctness see\nCalder 2019, 225\u2013226.)\n",
