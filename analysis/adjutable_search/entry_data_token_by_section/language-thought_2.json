    "main_text": "Mental Language || Compositional Semantics\n1.2 Compositional Semantics\n\nNatural language is\n compositional:\n complex linguistic expressions are built from simpler linguistic\nexpressions, and the meaning of a complex expression is a function of\nthe meanings of its constituents together with the way those\nconstituents are combined. Compositional semantics describes\nin a systematic way how semantic properties of a complex expression\ndepend upon semantic properties of its constituents and the way those\nconstituents are combined. For example, the truth-condition of a\nconjunction is determined as follows: the conjunction is true iff both\nconjuncts are true.\n\nHistorical and contemporary LOT theorists universally agree that\nMentalese is compositional:\n\n\nCompositionality of mental representations\n(COMP): Mental representations have a compositional\nsemantics: complex representations are composed of simple\nconstituents, and the meaning of a complex representation depends upon\nthe meanings of its constituents together with the constituency\nstructure into which those constituents are arranged.\n\n\nClearly, mental language and natural language must differ in many\nimportant respects. For example, Mentalese surely does not have a\nphonology. It may not have a morphology either. Nevertheless, COMP\narticulates a fundamental point of similarity. Just like natural\nlanguage, Mentalese contains complex symbols amenable to semantic\nanalysis.\n\nWhat is it for one representation to be a \u201cconstituent\u201d of\nanother? According to Fodor (2008: 108), \u201cconstituent structure\nis a species of the part/whole relation\u201d. Not all parts\nof a linguistic expression are constituents: \u201cJohn ran\u201d is\na constituent of \u201cJohn ran and Mary jumped\u201d, but\n\u201cran and Mary\u201d is not a constituent because it is not\nsemantically interpretable. The important point for our purposes is\nthat all constituents are parts. When a complex representation is\ntokened, so are its parts. For example, \n\n\nintending that \\(P \\amp Q\\) requires having a sentence in your\nintention box\u2026 one of whose parts is a token of the very same\ntype that\u2019s in the intention box when you intend that \\(P\\), and\nanother of whose parts is a token of the very same type that\u2019s\nin the intention box when you intend that \\(Q\\). (Fodor 1987: 139)\n\n\n\nMore generally: mental event \\(e\\) instantiates a complex mental\nrepresentation only if \\(e\\) instantiates all of the\nrepresentation\u2019s constituent parts. In that sense, \\(e\\) itself\nhas internal complexity.\n\nThe complexity of mental events figures crucially here, as highlighted\nby Fodor in the following passage (1987: 136):\n\n\nPractically everybody thinks that the objects of intentional states\nare in some way complex\u2026 [For example], what you believe when\nyou believe that \\(P \\amp Q\\) is\u2026 something composite, whose\nelements are\u2014as it might be\u2014the proposition that P\nand the proposition that Q. But the (putative) complexity of\nthe intentional object of a mental state does not, of course,\nentail the complexity of the mental state itself\u2026 LOT claims\nthat mental states\u2014and not just their propositional\nobjects\u2014typically have constituent structure.\n\n\nMany philosophers, including Frege and Russell, regard propositions as\nstructured entities. These philosophers apply a part/whole model to\npropositions but not necessarily to mental events during which\nthinkers entertain propositions. LOTH as developed by Fodor applies\nthe part/whole model to the mental events themselves: \n\n\nwhat\u2019s at issue here is the complexity of mental events and not\nmerely the complexity of the propositions that are their intentional\nobjects. (Fodor 1987: 142) \n\n\nOn this approach, a key element of LOTH is the thesis that mental\nevents have semantically relevant complexity.\n\nContemporary proponents of LOTH endorse RTT+COMP. Historical\nproponents also believed something in the vicinity (Normore 1990,\n2009; Panaccio 1999 [2017]), although of course they did not use\nmodern terminology to formulate their views. We may regard RTT+COMP as\na minimalist formulation of LOTH, bearing in mind that many\nphilosophers have used the phrase \u201clanguage of thought\nhypothesis\u201d to denote one of the stronger theses discussed\nbelow. As befits a minimalist formulation, RTT+COMP leaves unresolved\nnumerous questions about the nature, structure, and psychological role\nof Mentalese expressions.\n",
