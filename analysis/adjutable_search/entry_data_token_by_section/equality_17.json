    "main_text": "The Value of Equality: Why Equality?\n6. The Value of Equality: Why Equality?\n\nDoes equality play a major role in a theory of justice, and if so,\nwhat is this role? A conception of justice is egalitarian\nwhen it views equality as a fundamental goal of justice. Temkin has\nput it as follows:\n\n\u2026 an egalitarian is any person who attaches some value\nto equality itself (that is, any person that cares at\nall about equality, over and above the extent it promotes other\nideals). So, equality needn\u2019t be the only value, or even the ideal she\nvalues most\u2026\u2009. Egalitarians have the deep and (for them)\ncompelling view that it is a bad thing \u2013 unjust and unfair\n\u2013 for some to be worse off than others through no fault of their\nown. (Temkin 1986, p. 100, cf. 1993, p. 7)\n\n\nIn general, the focus of the modern egalitarian effort to realize\nequality is on the possibility of a good life, i.e., on an equality of\nlife prospects and life circumstances \u2013 interpreted in various\nways according to various positions in the \u201cequality of\nwhat\u201d debate (see above).\n6.1. Kinds of Egalitarianism\n\nIt is apparent that there are three sorts of egalitarianism: intrinsic,\ninstrumental and constitutive. (For a twofold distinction cf. Parfit\n1997, Temkin 1993, p. 11, McKerlie, 1996, p. 275.)\n\nIntrinsic egalitarians view equality as a good in itself. As\npure egalitarians, they are concerned solely with equality, most of\nthem with equality of social circumstances, according to which it is\nintrinsically bad if some people are worse off than others through no\nfault of their own. But it is in fact the case that people do not\nalways consider inequality a moral evil. Intrinsic egalitarians\nregarde quality as desirable even when the equalization would be of no\nuse to any of the affected parties, such as when equality can only be\nproduced through depressing the level of well being of everyone\u2019s\nlife. But something can only have an intrinsic value when it is good\nfor at least one person, when it makes one life better in some way or\nanother.\n\nThe following \u201cleveling-down\u201d objection indicates\nthat doing away within equality in fact ought to produce better\ncircumstances; it is otherwise unclear why equality should be desired.\n(For such an objection, cf. Nozick 1974, p. 229, Raz 1986, chap. 9, p.\n227, 235, Temkin 1993, pp. 247\u20138.) Sometimes inequality can only be\nended by depriving those who are better off of their resources,\nrendering them as poorly off as everyone else. (For anyone looking for\na drastic literary example, Kurt Vonnegut\u2019s 1950 science-fiction story\nHarrison Bergeron is recommended.) This would have to be an\nacceptable approach according to the intrinsic conception. But would\nit be morally good if, in a group consisting of both blind and sighted\npersons, those with sight were rendered blind because the blind could\nnot be offered sight? That would be morally perverse. Doing away with\ninequality by bringing everyone down contains \u2013 so the objection\ngoes \u2013 nothing good. Such leveling-down objections would of\ncourse only be valid if there were indeed no better and equally\negalitarian alternatives available, but there are nearly always such\nalternatives: e.g. those who can see should have to help the blind,\nfinancially or otherwise. When there are no alternatives, in order to\navoid such objections, intrinsic egalitarianism cannot be strict, but\nneeds to be pluralistic. Then intrinsic egalitarians could\nsay there is something good about the change, namely greater equality,\nalthough they would concede that much is bad about it. Pluralistic\negalitarians do not have equality as their only goal; they also admit\nother values and principles, above all the principle of welfare,\naccording to which it is better when people are doing better. In\naddition, pluralistic egalitarianism should be moderate\nenough to not always grant equality victory in the case of conflict\nbetween equality and welfare. Instead, they must accept reductions in\nequality for the sake of a higher quality of life for all (as with\nRawls\u2019 difference principle).\n\nAt present, many egalitarians are ready to concede that equality in\nthe sense of equality of life circumstances has no compelling value in\nitself, but that, in a framework of liberal concepts of justice, its\nmeaning emerges in pursuit of other ideals, like universal freedom,\nthe full development of human capacities and the human personality,\nthe mitigation of suffering and defeat of domination and\nstigmatization, the stable coherence of modern and freely constituted\nsocieties, and so forth (Scanlon 1996, 2018). For those who are worse\noff, unequal circumstances often mean considerable (relative)\ndisadvantages and many (absolute) evils; as a rule, these (relative)\ndisadvantages and (absolute) evils are the source of our moral\ncondemnation of unequal circumstances. But this does not mean that\ninequality as such is an evil. Hence, the argument goes, fundamental\nmoral ideals other than equality stand behind our aspiring for\nequality. To reject inequality on such grounds is to favor equality\neither as a byproduct or as a means, and not as a goal or intrinsic\nvalue. In its treatment of equality as a derived virtue, the sort of\negalitarianism \u2013 if the term is actually suitable \u2013 here\nat play is instrumental.\n\nAs indicated, there is also a third, more suitable approach to the\nequality ideal: a constitutive egalitarianism. According to\nthis approach, to the aspiration to equality is rooted in other moral\ngrounds, namely because certain inequalities are unjust. Equality has\nvalue, but this is an extrinsic value, since it derives from another,\nhigher moral principle of equal dignity and respect. But it is not\ninstrumental for this reason, i.e., it is not only valued on account\nof moral equality, but also on its own account. (For the distinction\nbetween the origin of a value and the kind of value it is, cf.\nKorsgaard 1996.) Equality stands in relation to justice as does a part\nto a whole. The requirement of justification is based on moral\nequality, and in certain contexts, successful justification leads to\nthe above-named principles of equality, i.e., formal, proportional\nequality and the presumption of equality. Thus, according to\nconstitutive egalitarianism, these principles and the resulting\nequality are required by justice, and by the same token constitute\nsocial justice.\n\nIt is important to further distinguish two levels of egalitarianism\nand non-egalitarianism, respectively. On a first level, a constitutive\negalitarian presumes that every explication of the moral standpoint is\nincomplete without terms such as \u2018equal,\u2019\n\u2018similarly,\u2019 etc. In contrast, a non-egalitarianism\noperating on the same level considers such terms misplaced or\nredundant. On a second level, when it comes to concretizing and\nspecifying conceptions of justice, a constitutive egalitarian gives\nequality substantive weight. On this level, more and less egalitarian\npositions can be found, according to the chosen currency of equality\n(the criteria by which just equality is measured) and according to the\nreasons for unequal distributions (exemptions of the presumption of\nequality) that the respective theories regard as well grounded.\nEgalitarianism on the second level thus relates to the kind, quality\nand quantity of things to be equalized. Because of such variables, a\nclear-cut definition of second level egalitarianism cannot be\nformulated. In contrast, non-egalitarians on this second level\nadvocate a non-relational entitlement theory of justice.\n6.2 Equality vs. Priority or Sufficiency\n\nAlongside the often-raised objections against equality mentioned in\nthe section on \u201csimple equality\u201d (3.1. above) there is a\ndifferent and more fundamental critique formulated by first level\nnon-egalitarians: that equality does not have a foundational role in\nthe grounding of claims to justice. While the older version of a\ncritique of egalitarianism comes mainly from the conservative end of\nthe political spectrum, thus arguing in general against\n\u201cpatterned principles of justice\u201d (Nozick 1974, esp. pp.\n156\u2013157), the critique\u2019s newer version also often can be heard in\nprogressive circles (Walzer 1983, Raz 1986, chap. 9, Frankfurt 1987,\n1997, Parfit 1997, Anderson 1999). This first-level critique of\nequality poses the basic question of why justice should in fact be\nconceived relationally and (what is here the same) comparatively.\nReferring back to Joel Feinberg\u2019s (1974) distinction between\ncomparative and non-comparative justice, non-egalitarians object to\nthe moral requirement to treat people as equals, and the many demands\nfor justice emerging from it. They argue that neither the postulate\nnor these demands involve comparative principles, let alone any\nequality principles. They reproach first-level egalitarians for a\nconfusion between \u201cequality\u201d and \u201cuniversals.\u201d\nAs the non-egalitarians see things, within many principles of justice\n\u2013 at least the especially important ones \u2013 the\nequality-terminology is redundant. Equality is thus merely a byproduct\nof the general fulfillment of actually non-comparative standards of\njustice: something obscured through the unnecessary insertion of an\nexpression of equality (Raz 1986, p. 227f.). At least the central\nstandards of dignified human life are not relational but\n\u201cabsolute.\u201d As Harry Frankfurt puts it: \u201cIt is\nwhether people have good lives, and not how their lives compare with\nthe lives of others\u201d (Frankfurt 1997, p. 6). And again:\n\u201cThe fundamental error of egalitarianism lies in supposing that\nit is morally important whether one person has less than another\nregardless of how much either of them has\u201d (Frankfurt 1987, p.\n34).\n\nFrom the non-egalitarian perspective, what is really at stake in\nhelping those worse off and improving their lot is humanitarian\nconcern, a desire to alleviate suffering. Such concern is not\nunderstood as egalitarian, as it is not focused on the difference\nbetween the better off and the worse off as such (whatever the applied\nstandard), but on improving the situation of the latter. Their\ndistress constitutes the actual moral foundation. The wealth of those\nbetter off only furnishes a means that has to be transferred for the\nsake of mitigating the distress, as long as other, morally negative\nconsequences do not emerge in the process. The strength of the impetus\nfor more equality lies in the urgency of the claims of those worse\noff, not in the extent of the inequality. For this reason, instead of\nequality the non-egalitarian critics favor one or another\nentitlement theory of justice, such as Nozick\u2019s (1974)\nlibertarianism (cf. 3.2. above) and Frankfurt\u2019s (1987) doctrine of\nsufficiency, according to which \u201cWhat is important from the\nmoral point of view is not that everyone should have the same\nbut that each should have enough. If everyone had enough, it\nwould be of no moral consequence whether some had more than\nothers\u201d (Frankfurt 1987, p. 21).\n\nParfit\u2019s (1997) priority view accordingly calls for a focus\non improving the situation of society\u2019s weaker and poorer members, and\nindeed all the more urgently the worse off they are, even if they can\nbe less helped than others in the process. Parfit (1995) distinguishes\nbetween egalitarianism and prioritarianism. According to\nprioritarians, benefiting people is more important the worse off those\npeople are. This prioritising will often increase equality, but they\nare two distinct values, since in an important respect equality is a\nrelational value while priority is not. However, egalitarians and\nprioritarians share an important feature, in that both hold that the\nbest possible distribution of a fixed sum of goods is an equal one. It\nis thus a matter of debate whether prioritarianism is a sort of\negalitarianism or a (decent) inegalitarianism. In any case,\nentitlement-based non-egalitarian arguments can practically result in\nan equality of outcome as far-reaching as egalitarian theories. Hence\nthe fulfillment of an absolute or non-comparative standard for\neveryone (e.g. to the effect that nobody should starve) frequently\nresults in a certain equality of outcome, where such a standard\ncomprises not only a decent but a good life. Consequently, the debate\nhere centers on the basis \u2013 is it equality or something else?\n\u2013 and not so much on the outcome \u2013 are persons or groups\nmore or less equal, according to a chosen metric? Possibly, the\ndifference lies even deeper, in their respective conceptions of\nmorality in general.\n\nEgalitarians can respond to the anti-egalitarian critique by conceding\nthat it is the nature of some (however certainly far from all)\nessential norms of morality and justice to be concerned primarily with\nthe adequate fulfillment of the separate claims of individuals.\nHowever, whether a claim can itself be considered suitable can be\nascertained only by asking whether it can be agreed on by all those\naffected in hypothetical conditions of freedom and equality. (See,\ne.g., Casal 2007 for a deeper discussion and critique of the doctrine\nof sufficiency.) This justificatory procedure is more necessary if it\nis less evident that what is at stake is actually suffering, distress,\nor an objective need. In the view of the constitutive egalitarians,\nall the judgments of distributive justice should be approached\nrelationally, by asking which distributive scheme all concerned\nparties can universally and reciprocally agree to. As described at\nsome length in the pertinent section above, many egalitarians argue\nthat a presumption in favor of equality follows from this\njustification requirement. In the eyes of such egalitarians, this is\nall one needs for the justification and determination of the\nconstitutive value of equality.\n\nSecondly, even if \u2013 for the sake of argument \u2013 the\nquestion is left open as to whether demands for distribution according\nto objective needs (e.g. alleviating hunger) involve non-comparative\nentitlement-claims, it is nonetheless always necessary to resolve the\nquestion of what needy individuals are owed. And this is tied in a\nbasic way to the question of what persons owe one another in\ncomparable or worse situations, and how scarce resources (money,\ngoods, time, energy) must be invested in light of the sum total of our\nobligations. While the claim on our aid may well appear\nnon-relational, determining the kind and extent of the aid must always\nbe relational, at least in circumstances of scarcity (and resources\nare always scarce). Claims are either \u201csatiable\u201d (Raz\n1986, p. 235) \u2013 i.e., an upper limit or sufficiency level can be\nindicated, after which each person\u2019s claim to X has been fulfilled\n\u2013 or they are not. For insatiable claims, to stipulate any level\nat which one is or ought to be sufficiently satisfied is arbitrary. If\nthe standards of sufficiency are defined as a bare minimum, why should\npersons be content with that minimum? Why should the manner in which\nwelfare and resources are distributed above the poverty level not also\nbe a question of justice? If, by contrast, we are concerned solely\nwith claims that are in principle \u201csatiable,\u201d such claims\nhaving a reasonable definition of sufficiency, then these standards of\nsufficiency will most likely be very high. In Frankfurt\u2019s definition,\nfor example, sufficiency is reached only when persons are satisfied\nand no longer actively strive for more. Since people find themselves\nourselves operating, in practice, in circumstances far beneath such a\nhigh sufficiency level, they (of course) live under conditions of\n(moderate) scarcity. Then the above mentioned argument holds as well\n\u2013 namely, that in order to determine to what extent it is to be\nfulfilled, each claim has to be judged in relation to the claims of\nall others and all available resources. In addition, the moral urgency\nof lifting people above dire poverty cannot be invoked to demonstrate\nthe moral urgency of everyone having enough. In both forms of scarcity\n\u2013 i.e., with satiable and insatiable claims \u2013 the social\nright or claim to goods cannot be conceived as something absolute or\nnon-comparative. Egalitarians may thus conclude that distributive\njustice is always comparative. This would suggest that distributive\nequality, especially equality of life-conditions, should play a\nfundamental role in any adequate theory of justice in particular, and\nof morality in general.",
