Aristotle writes that\nthere is a smallest size of material substrate on which it is possible\nfor the form of a given natural tissue to occur. Blood and bone, say,\nare all materially composed of given proportions of earth, air, fire,\nand water: there needs to be a certain minimal amount of these\nmaterial components present before the form of blood or bone can\noccur. This doctrine\u2014while surely compatible with\nAristotle\u2019s view that the material components are nonetheless\ncontinuous and divisible at any point\u2014is sometimes read by\nNeoplatonist commentators and later sources interested in\nrapprochement with atomism as evidence that Aristotle\nendorsed the existence of minimal physical parts.\n\nIn late antiquity, this debate seems to have moved away from the\nradical solution of positing minimal physical parts or atoms\u2014a\nview that seems to have had few advocates\u2014into a puzzle about\nthe possibilities of \u2018bottom up\u2019 explanation versus the\nneed to regard emergent properties as \u2018supervening\u2019 and\nnot mere products of the necessary material base. The term\ntraditionally translated \u2018supervene\u2019\nhere\u2014epigignomai\u2014refers to the idea that forms\nare thought to come from a distinct source and inhere in suitable\nmaterial, rather than to be produced by the material substrate: it\ndoes not exactly correspond to the technical notion of supervenience\nformulated in late-20th century philosophy of mind. The reasons for\npositing minimal thresholds for the supervenience of form in John\nPhiloponus concern the inadequacy of material explanation because\nchanges in the matter do not correlate numerically to\u2014and hence\ncannot fully explain\u2014changes in qualities, and not because of\nconcerns about minimal parts (Berryman 2002).\n\nScholars have highlighted the importance of Islamic philosophers in\ndeveloping what came to be known in medieval Latin philosophy as the\ndoctrine of minima naturalia (Dijksterhuis 1961, 205; Glasner\n2001; McGinnis 2015). Giles of Rome particularly developed the notion\nof a natural minima in Thomistic thought: the notion of a minimum size\nfor a given substance was linked in these discussions to the problem\nthat a given quantity of one element could only be rarefied so far\nbefore it becomes a different element (Duhem 1985, 35\u201345).\n\nBook 4 of Aristotle\u2019s Meteorology was sometimes\nregarded as inauthentic in the past because of its use of explanations\nof the microstructure of matter, explanations that some scholars\nargued were too much of a concession in the direction of atomism to be\nAristotle\u2019s own. These arguments are no longer widely\naccepted.\n",
