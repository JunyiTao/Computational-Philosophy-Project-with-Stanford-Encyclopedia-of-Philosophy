    "main_text": "History of social choice theory || Borda, Carroll, Black, and others\n1.3 Borda, Carroll, Black, and others\n\nCondorcet and Arrow are not the only founding figures of social choice\ntheory. Condorcet\u2019s contemporary and co-national Jean-Charles de\nBorda (1733\u20131799) defended a voting system that is often seen as\na prominent alternative to majority voting. The Borda count,\nformally defined later, avoids Condorcet\u2019s paradox but violates\none of Arrow\u2019s conditions, the independence of irrelevant\nalternatives. Thus the debate between Condorcet and Borda is a\nprecursor to some modern debates on how to respond to Arrow\u2019s\ntheorem.\n\nThe origins of this debate precede Condorcet and Borda. In the Middle\nAges, Ramon Llull (c1235\u20131315) proposed the aggregation method\nof pairwise majority voting, while Nicolas Cusanus (1401\u20131464)\nproposed a variant of the Borda count (McLean 1990). In 1672, the\nGerman scholar and jurist Samuel von Pufendorf (1632\u20131694)\ncompared simple majority, qualified majority, and unanimity rules and\noffered an analysis of the structure of preferences that can be seen\nas a precursor to later discoveries (e.g., on\nsingle-peakedness, discussed below) (Gaertner 2005).\n\nIn the 19th century, the British mathematician and\nclergyman Charles Dodgson (1832\u20131898), better known as Lewis\nCarroll, independently rediscovered some of Condorcet\u2019s and\nBorda\u2019s insights and also developed a theory of proportional\nrepresentation. It was largely thanks to the Scottish economist Duncan\nBlack (1908\u20131991) that Condorcet\u2019s, Borda\u2019s, and\nDodgson\u2019s social-choice-theoretic ideas were drawn to the\nattention of the modern research community (McLean, McMillan, and\nMonroe 1995). Black also made several discoveries related to majority\nvoting, some of which are discussed below.\n\nIn France, George-Th\u00e9odule Guilbaud ([1952] 1966) wrote an\nimportant but often overlooked paper, revisiting Condorcet\u2019s\ntheory of voting from a logical perspective and sparking a French\nliterature on the Condorcet effect, the logical problem\nunderlying Condorcet\u2019s paradox, which has only recently received\nmore attention in Anglophone social choice theory (Monjardet 2005). In\nparticular, Guilbaud anticipated some of the ideas underlying recent\nwork on the aggregation of judgments. For further contributions on the\nhistory of social choice theory, see McLean, McMillan, and Monroe\n(1996), McLean and Urken (1995), McLean and Hewitt (1994), and a\nspecial issue of Social Choice and Welfare, edited by Salles\n(2005).\n",
