    "main_text": "Philosophical Issues || Basic Semantic Methodology\n5.2 Basic Semantic Methodology\n\nAmbiguity has been used methodologically as a way to shield a theory\nfrom counter-example. Kripke laments this tendency explicitly:\n\n\nIt is very much the lazy man\u2019s approach in philosophy to posit\nambiguities when in trouble. If we face a putative counterexample to\nour favorite philosophical thesis, it is always open to us to protest\nthat some key term is being used in a special sense, different from\nits use in the thesis. We may be right, but the ease of the move\nshould counsel a policy of caution: Do not posit an ambiguity unless\nyou are really forced to, unless there are really compelling\ntheoretical or intuitive grounds to suppose that an ambiguity really\nis present.(Kripke 1977, p.268)\n\n\nGrice (1975) counsels a methodological principle: \u2018Senses are\nnot to be multiplied beyond necessity\u2019.\n\nThis general moral seems right. It is worryingly easy to deflect a\ncounter-example or to explain an intuition by claiming differences in\nmeaning. On the other hand, in philosophical discourse, distinctions\nthat are quite fine can be made that may well be missed by normal\nusers of the language who are inclined to miss\ndifferences in meaning that are slight. One thus often will be tempted\nto posit ambiguity as a way to reconcile differences between two\nplausible hypotheses about the meanings of words and phrases\n(\u2018evidence\u2019 has both an internal sense and an external\nsense, \u2018right action\u2019 has both a utilitarian sense and a\ndeontic sense\u2026) A neat case of this is Gilbert Ryle\u2019s\ncontention that \u2018exists\u2019 is ambiguous mentioned above:\n\n\n\u2026two different senses of \u2018exist\u2019, somewhat as\n\u2018rising\u2019 has different senses in \u2018the tide is\nrising\u2019, \u2018hopes are rising\u2019, and \u2018the average\nage of death is rising\u2019. A man would be thought to be making a\npoor joke who said that three things are now rising, namely the tide,\nhopes and the average age of death. It would be just as good or bad a\njoke to say that there exist prime numbers and Wednesdays and public\nopinions and navies; or that there exist both minds and bodies. (Ryle\n1949, p. 23)\n\n\nRyle here makes use of the conjunction reduction test mentioned above\nand has been the target of much scorn for his intuitions on this\nmatter. This may just go to show how hard it is to (dis)prove a claim\nto ambiguity using the tests.\n",
