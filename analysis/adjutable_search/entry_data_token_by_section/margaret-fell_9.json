    "main_text": "Other Quaker defences of women\u2019s preaching\n4. Other Quaker defences of women\u2019s preaching\n\n\nFell\u2019s arguments are echoed in the works of later Quaker\nwomen. In 1683, Elizabeth Bathurst published The Sayings of\nWomen (1683), the only other seventeenth-century tract after\nFell\u2019s to be \u201cexclusively devoted to the vindication of\nwomen\u2019s speaking\u201d (Apetrei 2010, 174). Like Womens\nSpeaking, this work is more than just a collection of quotations\nfrom the Bible: it is intended to show that, following Christ\u2019s\nrestitution of humanity, women once again share a spiritual equality\nwith men. In the \u201cPostscript\u201d to this work, Bathurst\ncontrasts the state of women after the fall with the state of women\nfollowing Christ\u2019s redemption. She points out that \u201cAs\nby Woman came in the Transgression and Degeneration; So by\nWoman also came the Reconciliation and Restoration, to wit,\nChrist, who came of the Woman\u2019s Seed\u201d (Bathurst\n1683, 24). Like Fell, Bathurst highlights the fact that women play a\nspecial role in redemptive history and, with the coming of Christ,\n\u201cMale and Female are made all one\u201d (24).\n\n\nOther Quaker women who assert the spiritual equality of men and\nwomen include Anne Docwra in her Epistle of Love (1683),\nDorcas Dole in Once more a Warning (1683), and an anonymous\nauthor in \u201cA Seventeenth-Century Quaker Women\u2019s\nDeclaration\u201d (c. 1675\u201380), a piece that may have been\nthe work of Fell\u2019s daughter, Sarah (Speizman & Kronick,\n1975).\n",
