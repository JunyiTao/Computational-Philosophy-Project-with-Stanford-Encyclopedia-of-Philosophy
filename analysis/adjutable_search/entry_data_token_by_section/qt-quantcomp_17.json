    "main_text": "Philosophical Questions || (Quantum) Computation and Scientific Explanation\n5.7 Are There Computational Kinds?\n\nFinally, another philosophical implication of the realisation of a\nlarge scale quantum computer regards the long-standing debate in the\nphilosophy of mind on the autonomy of computational theories of the\nmind (Fodor 1974). In the shift from strong to weak artificial\nintelligence, the advocates of this view tried to impose constraints\non computer programs before they could qualify as theories of\ncognitive science (Pylyshyn 1984). These constraints include, for\nexample, the nature of physical realisations of symbols and the\nrelations between abstract symbolic computations and the physical\ncausal processes that execute them. The search for the computational\nfeature of these theories, i.e., for what makes them\ncomputational theories of the mind, involved isolating some\nfeatures of the computer as such. In other words, the\nadvocates of weak AI were looking for computational properties, or\nkinds, that would be machine independent, at least in the\nsense that they would not be associated with the physical constitution\nof the computer, nor with the specific machine model that was being\nused. These features were thought to be instrumental in debates within\ncognitive science, e.g., the debate between functionalism and\nconnectionism (Fodor and Pylyshyn 1988).\n\nNote, however, that once the physical Church-Turing thesis is\nviolated, arguably some computational notions cease to be autonomous.\nIn other words, given that quantum computers may be able to\nefficiently solve classically intractable problems, hence re-describe\nthe abstract space of computational complexity (Bernstein and Vazirani\n1997), computational concepts and even computational kinds such as\n\u2018an efficient algorithm\u2019 or \u2018the class NP\u2019,\nbecome machine-dependent, and recourse to \u2018hardware\u2019\nbecomes inevitable in any analysis thereof (Hagar 2007).\n\nAdvances in quantum computing may thus militate against the\nfunctionalist view about the unphysical character of the\ntypes and properties that are used in computer science. In fact, these\ntypes and categories may become physical as a result of this\nnatural development in physics (e.g., quantum computing, chaos\ntheory). Consequently, efficient quantum algorithms may also serve as\ncounterexamples to a-priori arguments against reductionism (Pitowsky\n1996).\n",
