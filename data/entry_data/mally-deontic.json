    "main_text": "\n1. Introduction\n\nIn 1926, the Austrian philosopher Ernst Mally (1879-1944) proposed the\nfirst formal system of deontic logic. In the book in which he\npresented this system, The Basic Laws of Ought: Elements of the\nLogic of Willing, Mally gave the following motivation for his\nenterprise:\n\nIn 1919, everybody was using the word self-determination. I wanted to\nobtain a clear understanding of this word. But then, of course, I\nimmediately stumbled on the difficulties and obscurities surrounding\nthe concept of Ought, and the problem changed. The concept of Ought is\nthe basic concept of the whole of ethics. It can only serve as a\nusable foundation for ethics when it is captured in a system of\naxioms. In the following I will present such an axiomatic\n system.[1]\n\n\nAs Mally\u2019s words indicate, he was not primarily interested in deontic\nlogic for its own sake: he mainly wanted to lay the foundation of\n\u201can exact system of pure ethics\u201d (eine exakte reine\nEthik). More than half of his book is devoted to the development\nof this exact system of ethics. In the following, we will, however,\nconcentrate on the formal part of his book, both because it is its\n\u201chard core\u201d and because it is the part that has attracted\nthe most interest.\n2. Mally\u2019s Formal Language\n\nMally based his formal system on the classical propositional calculus\nas formulated in Whitehead\u2019s and Russell\u2019s Principia\nMathematica (vol.\u00a01, 1910).\n\nThe non-deontic part of Mally\u2019s system had the following vocabulary:\nthe sentential letters A, B, C, P and Q (these symbols refer to states\nof affairs), the sentential variables M and N, the sentential\nconstants V (the Verum, Truth) and \u039b (the\nFalsum, Falsity), the propositional quantifiers \u2203 and\n\u2200, and the connectives \u00ac, &, \u2228, \u2192 and \u2194.\n\u039b is defined by \u039b = \u00acV.\n\nThe deontic part of Mally\u2019s vocabulary consisted of the unary\nconnective !, the binary connectives f and \u221e, and the sentential\nconstants U and \u2229.\n\nMally read !A as \u201cA ought to be the case\u201d (A soll\nsein) or as \u201clet A be the case\u201d (es sei\nA).\nHe read A f B as \u201cA requires B\u201d (A fordert\nB).\nHe read A \u221e B as \u201cA and B require each\nother.\u201d\nHe read U as \u201cthe unconditionally obligatory\u201d (das\nunbedingt Geforderte).\nHe read \u2229 as \u201cthe unconditionally forbidden\u201d\n(das unbedingt Verbotene).\n\n\nf, \u221e and \u2229 are defined by:\n\n\nDef. f .\nA f B = A \u2192 !B (Mally 1926, p.\u00a012) \n\nDef. \u221e .\nA \u221e B = (A f B) & (B f A) \n\nDef. \u2229.\n\u2229 = \u00acU \n\n\nMally did not only read !A as \u201cit ought to be the case that\nA.\u201d Because a person\u2019s willing that a given state of affairs A\nbe the case is often expressed by sentences of the form \u201cA ought\nto be the case\u201d (for example, someone might say \u201cit ought\nto be the case that I am rich and famous\u201d to indicate that she\nwants to be rich and famous), he also read !A as \u201cA is\ndesirable\u201d or \u201cI want it to be the case that A.\u201d As\na result, his formal system was as much a theory about Wollen\n(willing) as a theory about Sollen (ought to be the case).\nThis explains the subtitle of his book. In modern deontic logic, the\nbasic deontic connective O is seldom read in this way.\n\nWe have just described one respect in which Mally\u2019s deontic logic was\ndifferent from more modern proposals. There are two other conspicuous\ndifferences:\n\nMally was only interested in the deontic status of states of\naffairs; he paid no special attention to the deontic status of\nactions. Thus, his Deontik was a theory about\nSeinsollen (what ought to be the case) rather than\nTunsollen (what ought to be done). Modern authors often\nregard the concept of Tunsollen as fundamental.\nIn modern deontic logic, the notions of prohibition F, permission\nP and waiver W are usually defined in terms of obligation O: FA =\nO\u00acA, PA = \u00acFA, WA = \u00acOA. Such definitions are not to be\nfound in Mally\u2019s book.\n\n3. Mally\u2019s Axioms\n\nMally adopted the following informal deontic principles (Mally 1926,\npp.\u00a015-19):\n\n\n(i)\nIf A requires B and if B then C, then A requires C. \n\n(ii)\nIf A requires B and if A requires C, then A requires B and\nC. \n\n(iii)\nA requires B if and only if it is obligatory that if A then\nB. \n\n(iv)\nThe unconditionally obligatory is obligatory. \n\n(v)\nThe unconditionally obligatory does not require its own\nnegation. \n\n\nMally did not offer much support for these principles. They simply\nseemed intuitively plausible to him.\n\nMally formalized his principles as follows (Mally 1926,\npp.\u00a015-19):\n\n\nI.\n((A f B) & (B \u2192 C)) \u2192 (A f C) \n\nII.\n((A f B) & (A f C)) \u2192 (A f (B & C)) \n\nIII.\n(A f B) \u2194 !(A \u2192 B) \n\nIV.\n\u2203U !U \n\nV.\n\u00ac(U f \u2229) \n\n\nAxiom\u00a0IV is strange:\n\n!U is a more natural formalization of (iv).\nAxiom\u00a0IV seems redundant: !A \u2192 !A is a tautology, so we\nhave !A f A by Def.\u00a0f, whence !(!A \u2192 A) by\nAxiom\u00a0III(\u2192), whence \u2203M !M by existential\ngeneralization. Axiom\u00a0IV seems to add nothing to this.\nAxiom\u00a0IV is the only axiom or theorem mentioned by Mally in\nwhich U occurs as a bound variable: in Axiom\u00a0V and in theorems\n(15)\u2013(17), (20)\u2013(21), (23), (23\u2032) and\n(27)\u2013(35) (to be displayed below), U is either a constant or a\nfree variable. One should treat it in the same way in the\nformalization of (iv).\n\n\nFor these reasons, we replace Axiom\u00a0IV by the following\n axiom:[2]\n\n\nIV.\n!U \n\n\nMally could hardly have objected to this version of Axiom\u00a0IV\nbecause it is equivalent with his theorem (23\u2032), i.e., V f U, in\nvirtue of Def.\u00a0f. In the following \u201cAxiom\u00a0IV\u201d\nwill always refer to our version of Axiom\u00a0IV rather than Mally\u2019s.\n\n\nUsing Def.\u00a0f, Axioms\u00a0I-V may also be written as follows\n(Mally 1926, pp.\u00a015-19 and p.\u00a024):\n\n\nI\u2032.\n((A \u2192 !B) & (B \u2192 C)) \u2192 (A \u2192 !C)\n\n\nII\u2032.\n((A \u2192 !B) & (A \u2192 !C)) \u2192 (A \u2192 !(B &\nC)) \n\nIII\u2032.\n(A \u2192 !B) \u2194 !(A \u2192 B) \n\nIV\u2032.\nV f U \n\nV\u2032.\n\u00ac(U \u2192 !\u2229) \n\n4.

Surprising Consequences\n\nMally called theorems (1), (2), (7), (22) and (27)\u2013(35)\n\u201csurprising\u201d (befremdlich) or even\n\u201cparadoxical\u201d (paradox). He viewed (34) and (35)\nas the most surprising of his surprising theorems. But Mally\u2019s reasons\nfor calling these theorems surprising are puzzling if not\nconfused.\n\nConsider, for example, theorem (1). Mally interpreted this theorem as\nfollows: \u201cif A requires B, then A requires everything that is\nthe case\u201d (Mally 1926, p.\u00a020). He regarded this as a\nsurprising claim, and we agree. However, Mally\u2019s interpretation of (1)\nis not warranted. (1) only says that if A requires B, then A requires\nthe Verum. The expression \u201cif A requires B, then A\nrequires everything that is the case\u201d is to be formalized as\n\n\n(1\u2032)\n(A f B) \u2192 (C \u2192 (A f C)) \n\n\nThis formula is an immediate consequence of (1) in virtue of\nAxiom\u00a0I. In other words, Mally should have reasoned as follows:\n(1\u2032) is surprising; but (1\u2032) is an immediate consequence\nof (1) in virtue of Axiom\u00a0I; Axiom\u00a01 is uncontroversial; so\n(1) is to be regarded as surprising.\n\n\nA similar pattern is to be seen in many of Mally\u2019s other remarks about\ntheorems which surprised him. He generally read too much into them and\nconfused them with some of the consequences they had in his\nsystem:\n\nMally was surprised by (2) because he thought that it says that if\nA requires B and B is not the case, then A requires every state of\naffairs whatsoever (Mally 1926, p.\u00a021). But (2) says no such\nthing. Mally\u2019s paraphrase is a paraphrase of (A f B) \u2192 (\u00acB\n\u2192 (A f C)) (a consequence of (2) in virtue of Axiom\u00a0I)\nrather than (2).\nMally paraphrased (7) as \u201cif anything is required, then\neverything that is the case is required\u201d (Mally 1926,\np.\u00a028), which is indeed surprising. However, Mally\u2019s paraphrase\ncorresponds with !A \u2192 (B \u2192 !B) (a consequence of (7) in\nvirtue of Axiom\u00a0I) rather than (7).\nMally paraphrased (22) as \u201cthe facts ought to be the\ncase\u201d (Mally 1926, p.\u00a024). We grant that this is a\nsurprising claim. But the corresponding formula in Mally\u2019s language is\nA \u2192 !A (a consequence of (22) in virtue of Axiom\u00a0I), not\n(22).\nMally read (27) as \u201cif something which ought not to be the\ncase is the case, then anything whatsoever ought to be the case\u201d\n(Mally 1926, pp.\u00a024, 33), but this is a paraphrase of !\u00acA\n\u2192 (A \u2192 !B) (a theorem of Mally\u2019s system) rather than\n(27).\nMally paraphrased (33) as \u201cwhat is not the case is not\nobligatory\u201d (Mally 1926, p.\u00a025) and as \u201ceverything\nthat is obligatory is the case\u201d (Mally 1926, p.\u00a034). These\nassertions are indeed surprising, but Mally\u2019s readings of (33) are not\nwarranted. They are paraphrases of !A \u2192 A rather than (33).\nMally made the following remark about (34) and (35):\n\n\n\nThe latter sentences, which seem to identify being obligatory with\nbeing the case, are surely the most surprising of our\n\u201csurprising\n consequences.\u201d[4]\n\n\nHowever, (34) and (35) do not assert that being obligatory is\nequivalent with being the case, for the latter statement should be\nformalized as A \u2194 !A. The latter formula is a theorem of Mally\u2019s\nsystem, as will be shown in a moment, but it is not to be found in\nMally\u2019s book. \n\n\nMally regarded theorems (28)\u2013(32) as surprising because of their\nrelationships with certain other surprising theorems:\n\n(28)\u2013(30) are instantiations of (27). But this is not sufficient\nto call these theorems surprising. Mally actually viewed (28) as less\nsurprising than (27): one might use it to justify retaliation and\nrevenge (Mally 1926, p.\u00a024).\n(31) implies (28)\u2013(30) and is therefore at least as surprising as\nthose theorems.\nMally viewed (32) as surprising because the surprising theorem\n(33) is an immediate consequence of (32) and the apparently\nnon-surprising theorem (25).\n\n\nMally\u2019s list of surprising theorems seems too short: for example, (24)\nis equivalent with A \u2192 !A in virtue of Def.\u00a0f. But A \u2192\n!A may be paraphrased as \u201cthe facts ought to be the case,\u201d\nan assertion which Mally regarded as surprising (Mally 1926,\np.\u00a024). So then why didn\u2019t he call (24) surprising? Did it not\nsurprise him after (22)?\n\nEven though Mally regarded many of his theorems as surprising, he\nthought that he had discovered an interesting concept of\n\u201ccorrect willing\u201d (richtiges Wollen) or\n\u201cwilling in accordance with the facts\u201d which should not be\nconfused with the notions of obligation and willing used in ordinary\ndiscourse. Mally\u2019s \u201cexact system of pure ethics\u201d was\nmainly concerned with this concept, but we will not describe this\nsystem because it belongs to the field of ethics rather than deontic\nlogic.\n6. Menger\u2019s Criticism\n\nMally\u2019s enterprise was received with little enthusiasm. As early as\n1926, it was noted that \u201cMr. Mally\u2019s deductions are frequently\nso amazingly obtuse and irrelevant that (despite his elaborate\nsymbolic apparatus) it is only necessary to state one or two of them\nto show how far his discussion has strayed from its self-appointed\ntask\u201d (Laird 1926, p. 395).\n\nIn 1939, Karl Menger published a devastating attack on Mally\u2019s system.\nHe first pointed out that A \u2194 !A is a theorem of this system. In\nother words, if A is the case, then A is obligatory, and if A ought to\nbe the case then A is indeed the case. As we have already noted in\nconnection with theorems (34) and (35), Mally made the same claim in\ninformal terms, but the formula A \u2194 !A does not occur in his\nbook.\n\nMenger\u2019s theorem A \u2194 !A may be proven as follows (Menger\u2019s proof\nwas different; PC denotes the propositional\ncalculus).\n\nFirst, A \u2192 !A is a theorem:\n\n\n1.\nA \u2192 ((!B \u2192 !B) & (B \u2192 A))\n[ PC\n ][5]\n\n\n2.\n((!B \u2192 !B) & (B \u2192 A)) \u2192 (!B\n\u2192 !A)\n[ I\u2032 ] \n\n3.\nA \u2192 (!B \u2192 !A)\n[ 1, 2, PC ] \n\n4.\n!B \u2192 (A \u2192 !A)\n[ 3, PC ] \n\n5a.\n!U\n[ Ax.\u00a0IV ] \n\n5b.\n!(!A \u2192 A)\n[ III\u2032(\u2192), PC ] \n\n6.\nA \u2192 !A\n[ 4, either 5a or 5b, PC ]\n\n\n \n\n\nSecond, !A \u2192 A is a theorem:\n\n\n1.\n((U \u2192 !A) & (A \u2192 \u2229)) \u2192 (U \u2192\n!\u2229)\n[ I\u2032 ] \n\n2.\n\u00ac((U \u2192 !A) & (A \u2192 \u2229))\n[ 1, V\u2032, PC ] \n\n3.\n\u00ac((U \u2192 !A) & (A \u2192 \u2229)) \u2192 (!A \u2192\nA)\n[ PC\n ][6]\n\n\n4.\n!A \u2192 A\n[ 2, 3, PC ] \n\n\nBecause A \u2192 !A and !A \u2192 A are theorems, A \u2194 !A is a\ntheorem as well.\n\nMenger gave the following comment:\n\n\nThis result seems to me to be detrimental for Mally\u2019s theory, however.\nIt indicates that the introduction of the sign ! is superfluous in the\nsense that it may be cancelled or inserted in any formula at any place\nwe please. But this result (in spite of Mally\u2019s philosophical\njustification) clearly contradicts not only our use of the word\n\u201cought\u201d but also some of Mally\u2019s own correct remarks about\nthis concept, e.g. the one at the beginning of his development to the\neffect that p \u2192 (!q or !r) and p \u2192 !(q or r) are not\nequivalent. Mally is quite right that these two propositions are not\nequivalent according to the ordinary use of the word\n\u201cought.\u201d But they are equivalent according to his theory\nby virtue of the equivalence of p and !p (Menger 1939,\np.\u00a058).\n\n\nAlmost all deontic logicians have accepted Menger\u2019s verdict. After\n1939, Mally\u2019s deontic system has seldom been taken seriously.\n7. Where Did Mally Go Wrong?\n\nWhere did Mally go wrong? How could one construct a system of deontic\nlogic which does more justice to the notion of obligation used in\nordinary discourse? Three types of answers are possible:\n\nMally should not have added his deontic axioms to classical\npropositional logic;\nSome of his deontic principles should be modified; and\nBoth of the above. Menger advocated the latter view: \u201cOne of\nthe reasons for the failure of Mally\u2019s interesting attempt is that it\nwas founded on the 2-valued calculus of propositions\u201d (Menger\n1939, p.\u00a059).\n\n\nThe first two suggestions turn out to be sufficient, so the third\nproposal is overkill.\n\n\nIn the following we will point out three facts:\n\n\nFirst, if Mally\u2019s deontic principles are added to a system in which\nthe so-called paradoxes of material and strict implication are\navoided, many of the \u201csurprising\u201d theorems (such as (34)\nand (35)) are no longer derivable and A \u2194 !A is no longer\nderivable either (section 8).\n\n\nSecond, if Mally\u2019s deontic principles are added to a system in which\nthe so-called law of the excluded middle is avoided, the unacceptable\nconsequence A \u2194 !A is no longer derivable, but almost all\ntheorems that Mally derived himself are still derivable (section 9).\n\n\nThird, if Mally\u2019s deontic principles, e.g., Def.\u00a0f and\nAxiom\u00a0I, are slightly modified, the resulting system is almost\nidentical with the system nowadays known as standard deontic logic\n(section 10).\n\n8. Alternative Non-Deontic Bases 1: Relevance Logic\n\nMally\u2019s informal postulates (i)\u2013(iii) and (v) are conditionals or\nnegations of conditionals, i.e., of the form \u201cif \u2026 then\n\u2014\u201d or \u201cnot: if \u2026 then \u2014.\u201d\nF\u00f8llesdal and Hilpinen (1981, pp.\u00a05-6) have suggested that\nsuch conditionals should not be formalized in terms of material\nimplication and that some sort of strict implication would be more\nappropriate. But this suggestion is not altogether satisfactory, for\nboth A \u2192 !A and A \u2194 !A are derivable in the very weak system\nS0.90 plus I\u2032 and III\u2032, where\n\u2192 is the symbol of strict\n implication.[7]\n\nIn systems of strict implication the so-called paradoxes of material\nimplication (such as A \u2192 (B \u2192 A)) are avoided, but the\nso-called paradoxes of strict implication (such as (A & \u00acA)\n\u2192 B) remain. What would happen to Mally\u2019s system if both\nkinds of paradoxes were avoided? This question can be answered by\nadding Mally\u2019s axioms to a system in which none of the so-called\n\u201cfallacies of relevance\u201d can be derived (see the entry on\n relevance logic).\n\nIn the following, we will add Mally\u2019s axioms to the prominent\nrelevance logic R. The result is better than in the\ncase of strict implication: most of the theorems which Mally regarded\nas surprising are no longer derivable, and Menger\u2019s theorem A \u2194\n!A is not derivable either. But many \u201cplausible\u201d theorems\ncan still be derived.\n\nRelevant system R with the propositional constant t\n(\u201cthe conjunction of all truths\u201d) has the following axioms\nand rules (Anderson & Belnap 1975, ch.\u00a0V; \u2194 is defined\nby A \u2194 B = (A \u2192 B) & (B \u2192 A)):\n\n\nSelf-implication.\nA \u2192 A \n\nPrefixing.\n(A \u2192 B) \u2192 ((C \u2192 A) \u2192 (C \u2192 B))\n\n\nContraction.\n(A \u2192 (A \u2192 B)) \u2192 (A \u2192 B) \n\nPermutation.\n(A \u2192 (B \u2192 C)) \u2192 (B \u2192 (A \u2192 C))\n\n\n& Elimination.\n(A & B) \u2192 A, (A & B) \u2192 B \n\n& Introduction.\n((A \u2192 B) & (A \u2192 C)) \u2192 (A\n\u2192 (B & C)) \n\n\u2228 Introduction.\nA \u2192 (A \u2228 B), B \u2192 (A \u2228 B) \n\n\u2228 Elimination.\n((A \u2192 C) & (B \u2192 C)) \u2192 ((A \u2228 B) \u2192\nC) \n\nDistribution.\n(A & (B \u2228 C)) \u2192 ((A & B) \u2228 C) \n\nDouble Negation.\n\u00ac\u00acA \u2192 A \n\nContraposition.\n(A \u2192 \u00acB) \u2192 (B \u2192 \u00acA) \n\nAx.\u00a0t.\nA \u2194 (t \u2192 A) \n\nModus Ponens.\nA, A \u2192 B / B \n\nAdjunction.\nA, B / A & B \n\n\nA relevant version RD of Mally\u2019s deontic system may\nbe defined as follows:\n\nThe language is the same as the language of R,\nexcept that we write V instead of t, add the propositional constant U\nand the unary connective !, and define \u039b, \u2229, f and \u221e\nas in Mally\u2019s system.\nAxiomatization: add Mally\u2019s Axioms\u00a0I-V to the axioms and\nrules of R.\n\n\nRD has the following properties.\n\nAxioms\u00a0I, II and III may be replaced by the following three\nsimpler\n axioms:[8]\n\n\nI*.\n(A \u2192 B) \u2192 (!A \u2192 !B) \n\nII*.\n(!A & !B) \u2192 !(A & B) \n\nIII*.\n!(!A \u2192 A) \n\n\nFormulas I\u2032\u2013V\u2032, (3), (4), (6), (8)\u2013(11), (14),\n(16)\u2013(18), (23\u2032) and (30) are theorems of\n RD.[9]\nFormulas (1), (2), (5), (7), (12), (13), (15), (19)\u2013(23),\n(24)\u2013(29), (31)\u2013(35), A \u2192 !A and !A \u2192 A are not\n derivable.[10]\nThere are 12 mismatches between RD and Mally\u2019s\nexpectations: (5), (12)\u2013(13), (15), (19)\u2013(21), (23) and (24)\u2013(26) are\nnot derivable even though Mally did not regard these formulas as\nsurprising, and (30) is a theorem even though Mally viewed it as\nsurprising.\nFormulas (34) and (35) (the formulas which Mally viewed as the\nmost surprising theorems of his system) are in a sense stranger than\nMenger\u2019s theorem A \u2194 !A because the latter theorem is derivable\nin RD supplemented with (34) or (35) while neither\n(34) nor (35) is derivable in RD supplemented with A\n\u2194\n !A.[11]\n\n\nAlthough most of Mally\u2019s surprising theorems are not derivable in\nRD, this has nothing to do with Mally\u2019s own reasons\nfor regarding these theorems as surprising. They are not derivable in\nRD because they depend on fallacies of relevance.\nMally never referred to such fallacies to explain his surprise. His\nconsiderations were quite different, as we have already described.\n\nRD is closely related to Anderson\u2019s relevant deontic\nlogic ARD, which is defined as R\nsupplemented with the following two axioms (Anderson 1967, 1968,\nMcArthur 1981; Anderson used the unary connective O instead of !):\n\n\nARD1.\n!A \u2194 (\u00acA \u2192 \u2229) \n\nARD2.\n!A \u2192 \u00ac!\u00acA \n\n\nAll theorems of RD are theorems of\n ARD.[12]\nARD1( \u2192 ) is not a theorem of\n RD+ARD2.[13]\n This formula does not occur in Mally\u2019s book. According to Anderson,\nBohnert (1945) was the first one to propose\n it.[14]\nARD2 is not a theorem of\n RD+ARD1.[15]\n This formula does not occur in Mally\u2019s book, but Mally endorsed the\ncorresponding informal principle: \u201ca person who wills correctly\ndoes not will (not even implicitly) the negation of what he wills;\ncorrect willing is free of\n contradictions.\u201d[16]\nRD supplemented with ARD1( \u2192 ) and ARD2 has\nthe same theorems as\n ARD.[17]\n\n\nAnderson\u2019s system has several problematical features (McArthur 1981,\nGoble 1999, 2001) and RD shares most of these\nfeatures. But we will not go into this issue here. It is at any rate\nclear that RD is better than Mally\u2019s original\nsystem.\n9. Alternative Non-Deontic Bases 2: Intuitionistic Logic\n\nIt was recently pointed out that it is also possible to base Mally\u2019s\ndeontic logic on intuitionistic propositional logic\nIPC rather than classical propositional logic\n(Lokhorst 2013; see also Centrone 2013).\n\nHeyting\u2019s intuitionistic propositional calculus IPC\nhas the following axioms and rules (see Van Dalen 2002 and the entry\non\n intuitionistic logic):\n\n\n\nA \u2192 (B \u2192 A) \n\n(A \u2192 (B \u2192 C)) \u2192 ((A \u2192 B) \u2192 (A \u2192\nC)) \n\n(A & B) \u2192 A \n\n(A & B) \u2192 B \n\nA \u2192 (B \u2192 (A & B)) \n\nA \u2192 (A \u2228 B) \n\nB \u2192 (A \u2228 B) \n\n(A \u2192 C) \u2192 ((B \u2192 C) \u2192 ((A \u2228 B) \u2192\nC)) \n\n\u22a5 \u2192 A \n\nmodus ponens \n\nsubstitution \n\n  \n\n\nIf we add to these axioms and rules the following:\n\nAbbreviations: \u00ac A = A \u2192 \u22a5, A \u2194 B = (A \u2192 B)\n& (B \u2192 A), T = A \u2192 A,\n\nthen we can formulate ID (an intuitionistic\nreformulation of Mally\u2019s deontic logic) as IPC plus\nMally\u2019s axioms I \u2013 V and\n\n\n\n(34)\nU \u2194 T \n\nVI\n!(A \u2228 \u00ac A) \n\n  \n\n\nAxiom VI follows from Mally\u2019s theorem (12d) (see Mally 1926, ch. 2,\nsec. 5, p. 29 and Morscher 1998, p.\n 122).[18]\n\nFACT 1. ID can alternatively be axiomatized as\nIPC plus axioms !A \u2194 \u00ac \u00ac A and\n (34).[19]\n Classical propositional logic, CPC, is\nIPC plus A \u2228 \u00ac A. MD\n(\u201cMally\u2019s Deontik\u201d) is ID plus\nCPC.\n\n\nFACT 2. A \u2194 !A is a theorem of\n MD.[20]\n\nIn modern deontic logic, P A (\u201cit is permitted that A\u201d) is\ndefined as P A = \u00ac !\u00ac A. If we adopt this definition,\nID provides !A \u2194 P A (because\nIPC provides \u00ac \u00ac A \u2194 \u00ac \u00ac \u00ac\n\u00ac A). Mally did not discuss permission. His approval of !A \u2192\n\u00ac !\u00ac A (which is usually regarded as characteristic for\ndeontic logic) is clear from Mally 1926, ch. 4, sec. 10, p. 49,\nad (V).\n\nMally objected to !(A \u2228 B) \u2192 (!A \u2228 !B) and Menger objected\nto A \u2194 !A (see Mally 1926, ch. 2, sec. 4, p. 27, ad (II)\nand the quote in Section 6 above). ID avoids these\nobjections:\n\nFACT 3. Neither !(A \u2228 B) \u2192 (!A \u2228 !B) nor !A \u2192 A is a\ntheorem of\n ID.[21]\n\n\nOnly one of the theorems presented by Mally is not derivable in\nID, namely (13b): \u00ac (A & \u00ac !B) \u2194\n(\u00ac A \u2228\n !B).[22]\n\nFACT 4. For any extension X of ID (in the language of\nID): X provides (13b) if and only if X provides !(A\n\u2228 B) \u2192 (!A \u2228\n !B).[23]\n\n\nID plus (13b) does not provide !A \u2192\n A.[24]\n\nThe intuitionistic reformulation of Mally\u2019s deontic logic that we have\nproposed is successful in so far as it avoids both Menger\u2019s and\nMally\u2019s own objections while preserving almost all the theorems that\nMally noticed himself. However, it is unacceptable as a system of\ndeontic logic in its own right. We mention only two reasons:\n\n1. Theorem A \u2192 !A is intuitively invalid. No deontic system,\nexcept Mally\u2019s, has this theorem.\n\n2. It is unclear how permission is to be represented. If we use the\nstandard definition (P A = \u00ac !\u00ac A), then P A \u2194 !A is a\ntheorem, but P A and !A are not equivalent according to the ordinary\nuse of the words \u201cpermitted\u201d and\n\u201cobligatory.\u201d\n\nThe relevantist reformulation of Mally\u2019s system that was discussed\nabove does not have these defects.\n\nAlthough ID is unacceptable as a system of deontic\nlogic, it does make sense as a system of lax logic, as we will\nnow show. Lax logic is used in the areas of hardware verification in\ndigital circuits and access control in secure systems, where !\nexpresses a notion of correctness up to constraints. The term\n\u201clax\u201d was chosen \u201cto indicate the looseness\nassociated with the notion of correctness up to constraints\u201d\n(Fairtlough and Mendler 1997, p. 3). There is a considerable\nliterature on lax logic (Goldblatt 2011).\n\nPropositional lax logic PLL is defined as\nIPC plus (A \u2192 !B) \u2194 (!A \u2192 !B)\n(Fairtlough and Mendler 1997, p. 4, Lemma 2.1). Lax logic\nPLL* is PLL plus !A \u2194 \u00ac\n\u00ac A (Fairtlough and Mendler 1997, p. 23).\n\nFACT 5. ID is an alternative axiomatization of lax\nlogic PLL* plus\n (34).[25]\n\n\nMally\u2019s deontic logic and lax logic arose from quite different\nconsiderations. It is therefore remarkable that the intuitionistic\nreformulation of Mally\u2019s logic that we have discussed is identical\nwith lax logic PLL* plus (34).\n10. Alternative Deontic Principles\n\nInstead of changing the non-deontic propositional basis of Mally\u2019s\nsystem, one might also modify the specifically deontic axioms and\nrules. This might of course be done in various ways, but the following\napproach works well without departing too much from Mally\u2019s original\n assumptions.[26]\n\nFirst, regard f as primitive and replace Mally\u2019s definition of f in\nterms of \u2192 and ! (Def.\u00a0f, the very first specifically\ndeontic postulate in Mally\u2019s book) by the following definition of ! in\nterms of V and f :\n\n\nDef. !.\n!A = V f A \n\n\nSecond, replace Axiom\u00a0I, which may also be written as (B \u2192\nC) \u2192 ((A f B) \u2192 (A f C)), with the following rule of\ninference:\n\n\nRule f.\nB \u2192 C / (A f B) \u2192 (A f C) \n\n\nWe may then derive:\n\n\n1.\nB \u2192 C / !B \u2192 !C\n[ Def.\u00a0!, R f ] \n\n2.\n(!A & !B) \u2192 !(A & B)\n[ Def.\u00a0!, Ax.\u00a0II ] \n\n3.\n!V\n[ 1, Ax.\u00a0IV, PC ] \n\n4.\n\u00ac!\u039b\n[ 1, Ax.\u00a0III(\u2190), Ax.\u00a0V, PC (ex\nfalso) ] \n\n\nThe so-called standard system of deontic logic KD is\ndefined as PC supplemented with 1-4 (except that ! is\nusually written as O: see the entry on\n deontic logic),\n so the new system is at least as strong as KD. It is\nnot difficult to see that it is in fact identical with\nKD supplemented with OU (Mally\u2019s Axiom\u00a0IV) and\nthe following definition of f : A f B = O(A \u2192 B). In modern\ndeontic logic, the notion of commitment is sometimes defined\nin this way.\n\nIn the new system, Mally\u2019s theorems have the following status.\n\nII\u2032, IV\u2032, (1)\u2013(5), (7)\u2013(11), (13)\u2013(15), (17),\n(20)\u2013(24) and (27)\u2013(32) are derivable.\nI\u2032, III\u2032, V\u2032, (6), (12), (16), (18)\u2013(19),\n(25)\u2013(26), (33)\u2013(35), A \u2192 !A and !A \u2192 A are not\nderivable.\nThere are 20 mismatches with Mally\u2019s deontic expectations: 10\n\u201cplausible\u201d formulas are no longer derivable, namely\nI\u2032, III\u2032, V\u2032, (6), (12), (16), (18)\u2013(19) and\n(25)\u2013(26), and 10 \u201csurprising\u201d theorems are still\nderivable, namely (1), (2), (7), (22) and (27)\u2013(32).\nAlthough (34) and (35) are not derivable, adding them would by no\nmeans lead to the theoremhood of A \u2194 !A.\n\n\nThere were only 12 mismatches in the case of RD, so\nthe new system does less justice to Mally\u2019s deontic expectations than\nRD did. But it agrees better with his general outlook\nbecause it is still based on classical propositional logic, a system\nto which Mally did not object (not that he had much choice in the\n1920s).\n\nMany of Mally\u2019s surprising theorems are derivable in\nKD, but they have, as it were, lost their sting:\nthose theorems lead to surprising consequences when combined with\nMally\u2019s Axiom\u00a0I and his definition of f , but they are completely\nharmless without these postulates.\n\nThe standard system of deontic logic has several problematical\nfeatures. The fact that each provable statement is obligatory is often\nregarded as counterintuitive, and there are many other well-known\n\u201cparadoxes.\u201d The revised version of Mally\u2019s system shares\nthese problematical features. But we will not discuss these issues\nhere. The standard system is at any rate better than Mally\u2019s original\nproposal.\n11. Conclusion\n\nMally\u2019s deontic logic is unacceptable for the reasons stated by Menger\n(1939). But it is not as bad as it may seem at first sight. Only\nrelatively minor modifications are needed to turn it into a more\nacceptable system. One may either change the non-deontic basis to get\neither a system that is similar to Anderson\u2019s system or a system that\nis identical with intuitionistic or constructive propositional logic\nwith double negation as an obligation-like operator, or apply two\npatches to the deontic postulates to obtain a system similar to\nstandard deontic logic.\n\nSome authors have refused to view Mally\u2019s deontic logic as a\n\u201creal\u201d deontic system and say that they \u201cmention it\nonly by way of curiosity\u201d (Meyer and Wieringa 1993, p.\u00a04).\nThe above shows that this judgment is too harsh. It is only a small\nstep, not a giant leap, from Mally\u2019s system to modern systems of\ndeontic logic, so Mally\u2019s pioneering effort deserves rehabilitation\nrather than contempt.\n",
