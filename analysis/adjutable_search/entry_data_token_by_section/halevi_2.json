    "main_text": "The Introductory Exchanges\n3. The Introductory Exchanges\n\n\nThe dialogue proper begins to unfold only after the king, upon\nrealizing in his dream that he must try to find out what actions are\ntruly pleasing to God, turns to a philosopher and asks him about his\nbeliefs. Why he seeks out the philosopher first and focuses\nspecifically on his beliefs as opposed to his knowledge or his actions\nis not explained, although it is plausible to suppose that the nature\nof the king's invitation to his various interlocutors indicates in\nadvance what he expects to hear from each one and perhaps also what he\ndoes not expect to hear. In any case, the unnamed philosopher provides\nwhat is generally acknowledged to be both a masterful and concise\nexposition of the Neoplatonic-Aristotelian world-view that dominated\nso much of medieval intellectual life from the 10th century on. While\nmost of the claims put forward were common to all medieval\nAristotelians, three ideas in particular suggest the influence of\nHalevi's contemporary, Ibn Bajjah (d. 1138), the foremost Aristotelian\nof his generation in Spain. These ideas are that union with the Active\nIntellect is possible during one's lifetime, that such union implies\ncognitive identity with other thinkers who know the truth, and that a\nphilosopher's life is essentially a solitary regimen.\n\n\nThe philosopher opens his presentation with a sharply negative\nappraisal of the presuppositions underlying the king's dream and\noffers a brief critical analysis to explain why he rejects each\none. Specifically, he denies that God is the kind of being who is\neither pleased or displeased about anything, has knowledge of\nparticular persons, actions, or events, or even can be regarded as the\n\u201cCreator\u201d of human beings, unless one understands this in\npurely metaphorical terms. What warrants these confident denials is\nthe philosopher's conception of a perfect being and how this\nshapes his understanding of divinity. Thus, a God who is capable of\nbeing pleased and displeased must have various aims and desires, all\nof which signify privation of that which is aimed at or desired, until\nit is provided. However, any being who is subject to privation and\nlack could hardly be considered perfect or divine. It would constantly\nbe in a deficient state and also dependent on others to provide\nwhatever is desired. Thus, Divinity as a perfect being is simply\nincompatible with having or experiencing privation. Accordingly, God,\nin contrast to all that is non-divine, is entirely beyond having\ndesires and aims because he lacks no perfection worthy of the\nname.\n\n\nSimilarly, God could hardly be the kind of being who knows\nparticular people, actions, intentions, or events, since these things\nchange with the passage of time. Were God to have knowledge of mutable\nthings, he, too, would be ever changing and always in need of being\ninformed of each new development. Far from being the exemplar of\nperfect being and knowledge, lacking nothing worth knowing, the God of\nthe Khazar king's dream turns out to be at all times the most\nepistemically needful and mutable of beings. This outcome also explains\nwhy God cannot be conceived in any literal sense as the Creator of the\nuniverse or humankind through some act of will meant to realize a\ndivine intention. For even if one were to assume that God's\nintention had always been to create the world at a particular time,\nt, and that this remained as true at\nt + 1 as it was\nat t \u2013 1, God would\nhave had to will the\nappropriate change at time t\nor to have performed some act resulting in the world's\ncreation at that time, lest there be no grounds whatsoever for claiming\nthat God actually caused the world to exist. However, once God is\nunderstood to be capable of changing in accordance with an intention,\nvolition, action, or relation, so as to become the Creator of the\nuniverse, it becomes problematic to think of God as a perfect being.\nOnce again, the suggestion that God changes by exercising his will in\ndifferent ways at different times also suggests that there is privation\nor potentiality within God, both before the act of creation, when\nGod's intention was as yet unrealized, and even more so\nafterwards, because of all the new and variable relationships\nestablished with the creation of the world. For these and similar\nreasons, the philosopher concludes that God is better conceived of as\nthe cause of all causes involved in the creation of every created\nthing, not through any intention or aim, but rather through an eternal\nand essentially changeless process of emanation.\n\n\nAt this point, the philosopher turns his attention away from\nan analysis and critique of the king's theological assumptions to\na systematic, topical exposition of his own largely\nNeoplatonic-Aristotelian views on cosmology and the prerequisites for\nhuman flourishing in the world as it is. Thus, he confidently maintains\nthat God did not create man at all because the world is eternal, and\nhuman beings have never ceased coming into being from those who\npreceded them. The universe itself turns out to be a complex system of\ninteracting causes and effects, which are necessarily connected to one\nanother on various levels. Human beings, naturally enough, are\nconstituted by and within this complex whole and combine within\nthemselves diverse forms, dispositions, character traits, and qualities\nthat reflect essentially three kinds of influences. These are, first,\ninfluences associated with one's parents and relatives, although\nwe are not told whether these are primarily biological or psychological\nin nature; second, those associated with environmental conditions, both\nproximate and remote, such as air, climate, geographic location, types\nof food and water, as well as the movements of celestial bodies; third\nand finally, those associated with education and training, which\nrealize and perfect each person's particular potentialities as\nfully as possible in order to complete an individual's\ndevelopment. Inevitably, these influences give rise to a wide array of\nindividuals, with diverse aptitudes, perfections, and deficiencies in\nvarious combinations and proportions. Together, they constitute the\nentire human species, ranging from the most perfect and least deficient\nto the exact opposite.\n\nThe philosopher, it turns out, is the one human type provided with all\nof the dispositions needed to actualize the natural, moral,\nintellectual, and practical virtues that bring about human flourishing\nin the fullest sense. Thus, he alone is said to lack nothing pertaining\nto perfection. What human perfection and flourishing ultimately consist\nof is a state of intellectual illumination by the Active Intellect, in\nwhich the passive or material intellect of the perfect individual\nperceives itself as reaching the level of attachment to, and, indeed,\nunion with its light. The Active Intellect belongs to the divine\nhierarchy. More specifically, it is the tenth and lowest of the\nincorporeal Intelligences in the philosopher's cosmology, which\npresides over the sub-lunar sphere and all it contains. Insofar as this\nIntellect comprehends the forms of everything that exists or occurs\nwithin our world, it is also capable of communicating what it knows,\neither partially or completely, in the form of intellectual\nilluminations (the aforementioned \u201clight\u201d) to any\nindividual whose material intellect is suitably prepared to receive it.\nHere, knowing follows the Aristotelian paradigm of becoming one with\nthe thing known, albeit in an immaterial way. Attachment to or union\nwith the Active Intellect thereby contributes to human perfection and\nflourishing by first providing the individual with the pleasures of\ndiscovery and genuine intellectual understanding and, second,\ninfluencing the subsequent activities of the individual in practical\nmatters so completely that his limbs perform only the most perfect\nactions, at the most appropriate times, in accordance with the best\nconditions, \u201cas if they were the organs of the Active Intellect\nitself.\u201d Broadly speaking, the attainment of intellectual union\nis presented as culminating in a life of rational self-sufficiency in\nwhich one always recognizes what the most rational course of action is\nand acts accordingly.\n\nThe philosopher comes closest to addressing the Khazar king's\nspecific concern with actions pleasing to God or pleasing in\nthemselves, when he outlines what is required in order to reach this\nlevel. Thus, the soul must be purified of doubts and acquire knowledge\nof the universals belonging to the sciences as they really are. It must\nalso keep to the way of justice regarding both character traits and\nactions, for these activities help the soul in conceiving of what is\ntrue and persevering in its inquiries. When these prerequisites are\nfulfilled, it will come to be like an angel, presumably, in the sense\nof actively and continuously contemplating the true realities of what\nit understands. Among the other consequences associated with this way\nof life, the philosopher indicates that the soul ceases to fear bodily\nextinction, but delights in life instead. It does this, in part,\nbecause it joins and becomes one with great thinkers ranging from the\nsemi-divine Hermes Trismegistus and Aesculapius to Socrates, Plato, and\nAristotle, suggesting, at the very least, that those who genuinely know\nthe truth are of one mind regarding it. Consequently, if anything\nsymbolizes \u201cGod's being pleased,\u201d it is just such\nunion with the Active Intellect. Furthermore, the shift from passivity\nto activity in conceiving the true realities also generates\ncontentment, modesty, and submissiveness along with every other\ndesirable character trait, including reverence for the First Cause.\nHowever, this reverence has nothing to do with hoping for its favor or\nbeing spared its wrath; the philosopher lives beyond such hopes and\nfears. Rather, philosophic reverence arises because it prompts one to\nimitate the Active Intellect by preferring truth to falsehood with the\nresult that one always accepts the truth and describes it in a fitting\nway. In effect, one reveres the First Cause because it is\nuseful.\n\nThe question of identifying specific acts through which one's\nreverence might be expressed is ultimately a matter of indifference to\nthe philosopher. Thus, he advises the king not to be concerned about\nwhich \u201cdivine Law\u201d to follow and what language, speech, or\nactions to employ in worship. If something is nevertheless deemed\nnecessary in order to cultivate the appropriate character traits or,\nbeyond that, to govern oneself and others, then the king should simply\ncreate his own religion or adopt one of the intellectual\nnomoi already composed by the philosophers to\nserve as his religion. Still, all of this is peripheral to the\nprincipal task, that of purifying one's soul of doubts, errors,\nmisunderstandings, and other defects after acquiring genuine knowledge\nof the universals belonging to the sciences, for this alone facilitates\nattachment to the Active Intellect. Once this occurs, if indeed it\ndoes, the philosopher allows that\nperhaps the Active Intellect will\nprovide the king, at some future time, with knowledge of hidden matters\nand even commands conveyed through veridical dreams and apposite\nimagery. Notwithstanding this tentatively encouraging observation, the\nphilosopher seems to conclude his exposition very much as he began it,\nby casting doubt upon the credibility of the king's dream,\ninasmuch as the king has obviously not reached this level, even while\noutlining with utmost brevity what a philosophic theory of prophetic\ndreams might look like.\n\nIn subsequent exchanges between the Khazar king and his interlocutors,\nHalevi goes on to furnish important additional information about both\nthe speakers themselves and also about the principles, themes, and\ncriteria of judgment that will be invoked to advance the dialogue and\nto evaluate the views and justifications offered to support them. This\napplies especially to his depiction of the king. Accordingly, the king\nresponds to the philosopher's speech by acknowledging that he\nfound it persuasive, but then immediately qualifies this by adding that\nit was nonetheless unresponsive to his request for practical guidance.\nThis divided response confirms from the outset that the king is himself\na divided man, someone open to and impressed by philosophy, but at the\nsame time open and plainly responsive to the claims of religion and\nparticularly claims regarding the importance of correct action. As the\ndialogue unfolds, therefore, he will often draw upon the\nphilosopher's skeptical stance or the various ideas introduced by\nhim in responding to other speakers in different contexts. However, the\nimportance he accords to his own experience and that of others\npossessing genuine empirical knowledge will play a decisive role in how\nhe seeks to have his particular concerns addressed and in the decisions\nhe ultimately makes regarding his own beliefs and actions.\n\n\nTo illustrate, he denies the need to purify his soul because\nhe already knows from his dream experience that his soul is pure. After\nall, his intentions were described as pleasing to God, but his actions\nwere not. Surely, then, pure intention is not enough; certain actions\nmust be pleasing in themselves. Moreover, if\nthis consideration is not sufficiently probative, the collective\nexperience of both Christians and Muslims is offered to establish the\npoint. Together, they divide the entire inhabited world among\nthemselves and sincerely direct their intentions towards pleasing God,\neven to the point of killing each other and readily sacrificing\nthemselves in their wars. Yet, however similar they may be in the\npurity of their intentions, their forms of religious praxis are at\nodds. Even more to the point, it is rationally\nimpossible for both Muslims and Christians to be\nright. Whether Halevi's point, here, is to\nemphasize the importance of collective experience through time in\ndeciding matters of correct behavior or to point out instead that the\nphilosopher's general indifference to praxis beyond recommending\nprudent behavior as an aid to philosophical understanding borders on\nrelativism is not clear; his purpose may be either or both. What is\nclear is that the king's rejoinder represents the beginning of a\ncritical appraisal of the philosopher's position that continues\nlong after the philosopher has left the scene.\n\n\nThis becomes clearer still after the philosopher replies\nthat the religion of the philosophers does not allow for killing either\nof the contending parties\u2014surely, a humane consideration that no\nvictim of religious discrimination or persecution, and especially no\nJew, could fail to appreciate. Yet, even though the king evidently\nshares the philosopher's doubts about the religious doctrine of\ncreation in six days and goes on to highlight his own skepticism about\nthe possibility of divine-human contact in connection with it, he\nnevertheless points out a glaring discrepancy between the\nphilosopher's theoretical account of prophecy and its\nprerequisites and actual experience. He notes that given the\nphilosopher's exemplary standards for virtuous behavior,\nknowledge of the sciences, and personal effort, prophecy should have\nbeen well known and widespread among them. They should also have had a\nreputation for performing wondrous feats. However, the facts show that\nthis is not the case. On the contrary, veridical or prophetic dreams do\ncome at times to people who are unconcerned with the sciences and\npurifying their souls, and they do not come to those who have\ndeliberately sought such things. From this, the king concludes that the\ndivine order of things (al-\u2019amr\nal-\u2019il\u00e2h\u00ee\n) and the souls of certain human beings have a secret character that\ndiffers from what the philosopher described. This reference to the\ndivine order and to the mysterious character of the souls of those who\nhave prophetic experiences associated with it introduces one of the\ncentral themes of the\nKuzari. While it will ultimately be a\nJewish scholar who explicates and illustrates these notions for the\nking, it is nonetheless significant that the king is the one who first\nmentions them. His doing so raises, at the very least, the possibility\nthat a pious pagan who acknowledges what is hidden or mysterious may\nperceive reality more completely and accurately than an overconfident\nphilosopher who immediately dismisses such things. The king's\nstatement also calls attention to the fact that whatever the divine\norder may signify in subsequent discussions, a pious pagan and\npresumably any others who come to speak of it are familiar with its\nmeaning and general use. In other words, the basic concept is not\nunique to any particular religion.\n\n\nAfter the philosopher departs, the king decides to speak\nwith the Christians and the Muslims on the assumption that one of their\nforms of practice must be pleasing to God, but he declines to speak\nwith the Jews owing to their paltry numbers, despicable condition, and\nthe universal contempt in which they are held. Accordingly, he asks a\nChristian scholar and then a Muslim scholar about his \u201cknowledge\nand actions\u201d (\u2018ilm\nwa-l-\u2018amal), and each replies, in turn,\nwith an affirmation of his faith, a brief history of his religion, and\nat least an adumbration of its practice. In their attempt to address\nthe king's practical concerns, each one also presents his\nreligion as the culmination of a prophetic tradition going back to the\nexperiences of biblical Israel. Nevertheless, the king rejects both\npresentations, in the former case, because its principal claims are\njudged to be at odds with reason, and in the latter, because it fails\nto provide adequate empirical evidence that a revelation actually\noccurred and that its alleged content is itself miraculous. Despite\nthese negative appraisals, both exchanges (K 1:4\u20139) have the positive\neffect of making clear that what the king seeks is a statement of\npraxis supported by incontrovertible evidence that grips the heart\ncompletely. Building upon the paradigm of how natural scientists\nexplain extraordinary phenomena, the king maintains that if direct\nexperience, however unlikely or unexpected, is well founded and grips\nthe heart, it must be accepted. This is because experience is primary\nand foundational, while the task of theory is to show rationally how\nwhat initially seemed unlikely is actually plausible. Ultimately, he\nproposes four criteria for evaluating claims of divine contact with\nflesh and blood. The evidence in favor of a convincing claim must be:\n(1) genuinely miraculous in the sense of describing effects that are\nclearly transformative and beyond human powers to produce; (2)\nwitnessed by multitudes; (3) seen with their own eyes; and (4) capable\nof being studied and examined repeatedly.\n\n\nBecause both his Christian and Muslim interlocutors had\ngrounded their beliefs on God's widely attested revelation to\nancient Israel, the king concludes that he has no alternative but to\nspeak with a Jewish sage and ask about his belief. The sage replies\nwith an affirmation of his faith in the God of Abraham, Isaac, and\nIsrael, who is described as having miraculously rescued all of the\nchildren of Israel from Egyptian bondage, provided for them in the\nwilderness, given them the Holy Land, and sent Moses with the divine\nLaw. To this, he adds that God subsequently sent thousands of prophets\nto support this Law through their promises and warnings. In addition to\nthe statement's remarkable brevity, it is significant in several\nways. While asked to state his belief\n(i\u2019tiqad) in the sense of opinion or\nreasoned conviction, the Jewish sage replies instead with a profession\nof faith (iman), signifying\ntrust or steadfast reliance, which is typically the result of lived\nexperiences that culminate in special relationships and understandings.\nThe statement is also notable for not basing faith on one momentous\nexperience within a single individual's lifetime, but rather for\nlinking it with a long series of memorable experiences over the\nlifetime of an entire people. Beyond this, the narrative alludes\ndirectly and indirectly to divine contacts with human beings that were\nsupported by public, empirical, and miraculous evidence that could be\nstudied, re-examined, and, in some sense, tested repeatedly. Indeed,\nthe dispatch of thousands of prophets in support of the Law over the\ncenturies suggests that there was a recurrent need for re-studying the\nevidence and testing its import with the passage of time. Finally, the\nstatement is programmatic insofar as it identifies many topics and\nthemes to be addressed later, such as evidence for believing in the\nexistence of God, the relationship between familial ties and experience\nof the divine, prophets and prophecy, revelation and divine Law, the\nHoly Land and its significance, and divine providence, among others.\nThis is probably why the sage concludes his statement by noting that\nthe Jewish faith embraces everything taught in the Torah, \u201cbut\nthe story is long.\u201d (K 1:11)\n\n\nIn the discussion that immediately follows, Halevi puts\nforward the first of a series of distinctions and rejoinders that\ncollectively amount to a broad-ranging critique of the\nphilosopher's statement and even of philosophy as such. Still, as\nwill become clear, his critique is not so comprehensive that it\nprecludes selective appropriation and adaptation of certain\nphilosophical ideas for his own purposes. Thus, the king expresses\nsurprise that the sage said nothing about God's being the Creator\nof the world, who orders and governs it in such a way that people\nstrive to imitate God's wisdom and justice in their own actions.\nTo this, the sage replies that the king is referring to the kind of\nsyllogistic, governmental religion to which speculation leads. In\ncontemporary terms, this would now be called a civil religion designed\nto govern and educate human passions based on practical reason. The\nsage continues by saying that the king is overlooking the fact that\nsuch religions contain many doubtful claims. What is more, he adds, the\nking will find that the philosophers do not agree on any single action\nor belief, and this is contrary to the idealized picture of union and\nunanimity among the great thinkers that is mentioned in the\nphilosopher's speech. To be sure, they make many claims, but only\nsome of these are strictly demonstrable. Others are, at best, merely\nprobable or persuasive, and still others do not even reach that level.\nHere, then, one finds the sage using basic philosophical distinctions\nabout the varying degrees of validity and soundness by which premises\nand syllogisms are classified as either demonstrative, dialectical,\nrhetorical, poetic, or sophistical, to call into question the presumed\nsoundness and certainty of whatever the philosophers have to say. By\ncontrast, however, the sage contends that matters of direct\nobservation, such as those he had described in his opening statement,\nrequire neither proof nor demonstration. They are and ought to be\naccepted as foundational. The king quickly indicates that he regards\nthe sage's critical observations as more likely to be persuasive\nthan his opening statement was, but he requests additional proof. When\ntold that the sage's opening statement was\nthe proof, he is plainly at a loss to understand how that is\npossible. It is with this expression of puzzlement (K 1:16) that the\nintroductory exchanges between the king and his successive\ninterlocutors comes to an end. Clearly, the Jewish sage has not taken\nthe king very far from his skeptical moorings, but he has nevertheless\nsucceeded where his predecessors did not. He has caused the king to\nwonder just how a person as critical and astute as the sage seems to be\ncould regard his extraordinary claims as constituting proof for their\nown veracity. His success, simply stated, was to engage the\nking's latent interest in his reply and, by doing so, to keep\ntheir conversation going.\n",
