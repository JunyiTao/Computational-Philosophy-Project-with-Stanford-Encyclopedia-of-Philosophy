Justification: Liberty and Consequences\n\nThe justificatory issue might therefore be confronted directly,\nwithout invoking any sort of history or genealogical narrative.\n\nIn dealing with the pros and cons of private property as an\ninstitution, it has sometimes been suggested that the general\njustification of private property and the distribution of particular\nproperty rights can be treated as separate issues, rather in the way\nthat some philosophers suggested that the general justification of\npunishment can be separated from the principles governing its\ndistribution (Hart 1968, p. 4; see also Ryan 1984, p. 82 and Waldron\n1988, p. 330). In neither case, though, is the separation complete: it\nholds for some general justifications and not for others. In the\ntheory of punishment, a retributivist will believe that the principles\ngoverning punishment in general necessarily also regulate its\nparticular distribution. And there are analogues in the theory of\nproperty. Robert Nozick (1974) argued that a theory of historical\nentitlement, along Lockean lines, provides both a complete\njustification of the institution and a set of strict criteria that\ngovern its legitimate distribution. Property rights, according to\nNozick, constrain the extent to which we are entitled to act on our\nintuitions and theories about distributive justice. Consequentialist\ntheories, however, may be able to separate the institutional and\ndistributive issues in this way, and some theories of liberty may be\nable to do this also (though the distribution of liberty is itself\nsomething about which most libertarians have firm\u2014and\negalitarian!\u2014views). As we assess various distributive\narguments, then, it is a good idea to keep in mind the question of\nwhether or not they have direct or indirect distributive\nimplications.\n\nOn the other hand, it is surely important to keep in view the\n\u2018big picture\u2019 that a system of property presents (Singer\n2000 and Purdy 2011). What overall model of community is generated by\na given system of property rights and by the way they circulate in\nsociety? What kinds of inter-personal relations does a given\nsystem of property foster? What ethos of economic interaction does it\ngive rise to: an obsession with efficiency, an ethic of\ncompetitiveness, or a shared concern for those who are less well-off?\nThese questions are not distinct from questions about distribution,\nbut they look at them in a different light, not just asking about\ntheir moral justification one by one.\n\nThe most common form of justificatory argument is consequentialist:\npeople in general are better off when a given class of resources is\ngoverned by a private property regime than by any alternative system.\nUnder private property, it is said, the resources will be more wisely\nused, or used to satisfy a wider (and perhaps more varied) set of\nwants than under any alternative system, so that the overall enjoyment\nthat humans derive from a given stock of resources will be increased.\nThe most persuasive argument of this kind is sometimes referred to as\n\u2018the tragedy of the commons\u2019 (Hardin 1968). If everyone is\nentitled to use a given piece of land, then no one has an incentive to\nsee that crops are planted or that the land is not over-used. Or if\nanyone does take on this responsibility, they themselves are likely to\nbear all the costs of doing so (the costs of planting or the costs of\ntheir own self-restraint), while any benefits of their prudence will\naccrue to all subsequent users. And in many cases there will be no\nbenefits, since one individual\u2019s planning or restraint will be futile\nunless others cooperate. So, under a system of common property, each\ncommoner has an incentive to get as much as possible from the land as\nquickly as possible, since the benefits of doing this are in the\nshort-term concentrated and assured, while the long-term benefits of\nself-restraint are uncertain and diffused. However, if a piece of\nhitherto common land is divided into parcels and each parcel is\nassigned to a particular individual who can control what happens\nthere, then planning and self-restraint will have an opportunity to\nassert themselves. For now the person who bears the cost of restraint\nis in a position to reap all the benefits; so that if people are\nrational and if restraint (or some other form of forward-looking\nactivity) is in fact cost-effective, there will be an overall increase\nin the amount of utility derived.\n\nArguments of this sort are familiar and important, but like all\nconsequentialist arguments, they need to be treated with caution. In\nmost private property systems, there are some individuals who own\nlittle or nothing, and who are entirely at the mercy of others. So\nwhen it is said that \u2018people in general\u2019 are better off\nunder private property arrangements, we have to ask \u2018Which\npeople? Everyone? The majority? Or just a small class of owners whose\nprosperity is so great as to offset the consequent immiseration of the\nothers in an aggregative utilitarian calculus?\u2019 (Wenar 1998).\nJohn Locke hazarded the suggestion that everyone would be better off. \nComparing England, whose commons were swiftly being enclosed by\nprivate owners, to pre-colonial America, where the natives continued\nto enjoy universal common access to land, Locke speculated that\n\u2018a King of a large and fruitful Territory there [i.e. in\nAmerica] feeds, lodges, and is clad worse than a day Labourer in\nEngland.\u2019 (Locke 1988 [1689], II, para. 41) The laborer may not\nown anything, but his standard of living is higher on account of the\nemployment prospects that are offered in a prosperous privatized\neconomy. Alternatively, the more optimistic of the consequentialists\ncast their justifications in the language of what we would now call\n\u2018Pareto-improvement\u2019. Maybe the privatization of\npreviously common land does not benefit everybody: but it benefits\nsome and it leaves others no worse off than they were before. The\nhomelessness and immiseration of the poor, on this account, is not a\nresult of private property; it is simply the natural predicament of\nmankind from which a few energetic appropriators have managed to\nextricate themselves.\n\nSo far we have considered the consequentialist case for private\nproperty over common property. The consequentialist case for private\nproperty over collective property has more to do with markets than\nwith the need for responsibility and self-restraint in resource use.\nThe argument for markets is that in a complex society there are\ninnumerable decisions to be made about the allocation of particular\nresources to particular production processes. Is a given ton of coal\nbetter used to generate electricity which will in turn be used to\nrefine aluminum for manufacturing cooking pots or aircraft, or to\nproduce steel which can be used to build railway trucks, which may in\nturn be used to transport either cattle feed or bauxite from one place\nto another? In most economies there are hundreds of thousands of\ndistinct factors of production, and it has proved impossible for\nefficient decisions about their allocation to be made by central\nagencies acting in the name of the community and charged with\noverseeing the economy as a whole. In actually existing socialist\nsocieties, central planning turned out to be a way of ensuring\neconomic paralysis, inefficiency and waste (Mises 1951). In market\neconomies, decisions like these are made on a decentralized basis by\nthousands of individuals and firms responding to price signals, each\nseeking to maximize profits from the use of the productive resources\nunder its control, and such a system often works efficiently. Some\nhave speculated that there could be markets without private property\n(Rawls, 1971, p. 273), but this seems hopeless. Unless individual\nmanagers in a market economy are motivated directly or indirectly by\nconsiderations of personal profit in their investment and allocation\ndecisions, they cannot be expected to respond efficiently to prices.\nSuch motivation will occur only if the resources are privately owned,\nso that the loss is theirs (or their employer\u2019s) when a market signal\nis missed and the gain is theirs (or their employer\u2019s) when a\nprofitable allocation is secured.\n\nI said earlier that a consequentialist defense is in trouble unless it\ncan show that everyone is better off under a private property system,\nor at least that no-one is worse off. Now, a society in which all\ncitizens derive significant advantages from the privatization of the\neconomy is perhaps not an impossible ideal. But in every existing\nprivate property system there is a class of people who own little or\nnothing and who are arguably much worse off under that system than\nthey would be under a socialist alternative. A justificatory theory\ncannot ignore their predicament, if only because it is their\npredicament that poses the justificatory issue in the first place\n(Waldron 1993). A hard-line consequentialist may insist that the\nadvantages to those who profit from private ownership outweigh the\ncosts to the underclass. Philosophically, however, this sort of hard\nline is quite disreputable (Rawls 1971, pp. 22\u201333; Nozick 1974,\npp. 32\u20133). If we take the individual rather than a notional\nentity like \u2018the social good\u2019 as the focal point of moral\njustification, then there ought to be something we can say to\neach individual why the institution we are defending is\nworthy of her support. Otherwise it is not at all clear why\nshe should be expected to observe its rules (except when we\nhave the power and the numbers to compel her to do so).\n\nMaybe the consequentialist argument can be supplemented with an\nargument about desert in order to show that there is justice in some\npeople\u2019s enjoying the fruits of private property while others languish\nin poverty. If private property involves the wiser and more efficient\nuse of resources, it is because someone has exercised virtues of\nprudence, industry, and self-restraint. People who languish in\npoverty, on this account, do so largely because of their idleness,\nprofligacy or want of initiative. Now, theories like this are easily\ndiscredited if they purport to justify the actual distribution of\nwealth under an existing private property economy (Nozick 1974, pp.\n158\u20139; Hayek 1976). But there is a more modest position which\ndesert theorists can adopt: namely, that private property alone offers\na system in which idleness is not rewarded at the expense of industry,\na system in which those who take on the burdens of prudence and\nproductivity can expect to reap some reward for their virtue which\ndistinguishes them from those who did not make any such effort (Munzer\n1990, pp. 285 ff.).\n\nMany of the alleged market-advantages accrue only if private property\nis distributed in certain ways. Monopolistic control of the main\nfactors of production by a few individuals or corporations can play\nhavoc with market efficiency; and it can also lead to such great\nconcentrations of private power as to offset any argument for property\nbased on freedom, dissent or democracy. Distributive equity may be\ncrucial also for non-consequentialist arguments. The idea that\nproperty-owning promotes virtue is, as we have seen, as old as\nAristotle; and even today it is used by civic republicans as an\nargument against economic collectivism. According to this argument, if\nmost economic resources are owned in common or controlled collectively\nfor everyone\u2019s benefit, there is no guarantee that citizen\u2019s\nconditions of life will be such as to promote republican virtue. In a\ncommunist or collectivist society, citizens may behave either as\npassive beneficiaries of the state or irresponsible participants in a\ntragedy of the commons. If a generation or two grow up with that\ncharacter then the integrity of the whole society is in danger. These\narguments are interesting, but it is worth noting how sensitive they\nare to the distribution of property (Waldron 1986, pp. 323\u201342).\nAs T.H. Green observed, a person who owns nothing in a capitalist\nsociety \u2018might as well, in respect of the ethical purposes which\nthe possession of property should serve, be denied rights of property\naltogether\u2019 (Green 1941 [1895], p. 219).\n\nWe must also consider justificatory arguments that connect property\nwith liberty. Societies with private property are often described as\nfree societies. Part of what this means is surely that owners are free\nto use their property as they please; they are not bound by social or\npolitical decisions. (And correlatively, the role of government in\neconomic decision-making is minimized.) But that cannot be all that is\nmeant, for it would be equally apposite to describe private property\nas a system of unfreedom, since it necessarily involves the\nsocial exclusion of people from resources that others own. All\nproperty systems distribute freedoms and unfreedoms; no system of\nproperty can be described without qualification as a system of\nliberty. Someone may respond that the liberty to use what belongs to\nanother is license not liberty, and so its exclusion should not really\ncount against a private property system in the libertarian calculus. \nBut the price of this maneuver is very high: not only does it commit\nthe libertarian to a moralized conception of freedom of the sort that\nhe usually shies away from (as in case of positive liberty), but it\nalso means that liberty, so defined, can no longer be invoked to\nsupport property except in a question-begging way (Cohen 1982).\n\nTwo other things might be implied by the libertarian characterization.\nThe first is a point about independence: a person who owns a\nsignificant amount of private property\u2014a home, say, and a source\nof income\u2014has less to fear from the opinion and coercion of\nothers than the citizen of a society in which some other form of\nproperty predominates. The former inhabits, in a fairly literal sense,\nthe \u2018private sphere\u2019 that liberals have always treasured\nfor individuals\u2014a realm of action in which he need answer to\nno-one but himself. But like the virtue argument, this version of the\nlibertarian case is also sensitive to distribution: for those who own\nnothing in a private property economy would seem to be as\nunfree\u2014by this argument\u2014as anyone would be in a socialist\nsociety.\n\nThat last point may be too quick, however, for there are other\nindirect ways in which private property contributes to freedom (Purdy\n2005). Milton Friedman (1962) argues that political liberty is\nenhanced in a society where the means of intellectual and political\nproduction (printing presses, photocopying machines, computers) are\ncontrolled by a number of private individuals, firms, and\ncorporations\u2014even if that number is not very large. In a\ncapitalist society, a dissident has the choice of dealing with several\npeople (other than state officials) if he wants to get his message\nacross, and many of them are prepared to make their media available\nsimply on the basis of money, without regard to the message. In a\nsocialist society, by contrast, those who are politically active\neither have to persuade state agencies to disseminate their views, or\nrisk underground publication. More generally, Friedman argues, a\nprivate property society offers those who own nothing a greater\nvariety of ways in which they earn a living\u2014a larger menu of\nmasters, if you like\u2014than they would be offered in a socialist\nsociety. In these ways, private property for some may make a positive\ncontribution to freedom\u2014or at least an enhancement of\nchoice\u2014for everyone.\n\nFinally, in this review of direct normative arguments about property,\nwe should consider the moral importance property might have in respect\nof what it is, rather than what it does or brings about. Property\nrights in and of themselves give people a certain status and\nrecognition in society: a property owner is respected in his or her\ncontrol of a resource (Dorfman 2012). This is surely important; it\nwas, as we saw, one of the themes of the approach taken in Hegel 1967\nand in Kant 1991 (see Byrd and Hruschka 2006). But it can have critical\nimplications for property too, for if property is unevenly\ndistributed, if inequality is radical and some are more or less\ncomprehensively bereft of property rights, then acute issues have to\nbe faced about the uneven distribution of the bases of respect. We\ncannot take seriously the good that property rights do in regard to\nmoral recognition without also considering the inherent harm of\nabsence of such recognition in the case of those who own nothing.\n",
