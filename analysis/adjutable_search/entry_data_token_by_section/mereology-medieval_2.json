    "main_text": "Forums for medieval mereology || The Topics\n1.2 The Topics\n\n\u201cTopic\u201d is the standard translation for the Latin term\nlocus. (Note that the translators of Peter of Spain (2014)\nhave chosen to render it as \u201cplace\u201d, which is the basic\nmeaning of the Latin term.) As Stump (1978, Part 2, and 1982) and\nGreen-Pedersen (1984) have pointed out, the notion of the Topic\nevolves over the course of its use in ancient and medieval logic, but\nroughly put, medieval logicians think that the study of the Topics\nhelps one to discover a number of self-evidently true propositions, or\n\u201cmaximal propositions\u201d, that can serve as warrants for\narguments. (See Peter of Spain, Tractatus V.3\u20134 (2014,\n198\u2013205).) For example, suppose that someone makes this\ninference:\n\nIf Socrates is human, Socrates is animal.\n\n\nStudents of the Topics claim that this inference is warranted by the\nfollowing maximal proposition:\n\nIf a species is predicated of something, that species\u2019 genus is\nalso predicable of that thing.\n\n\nThe student of medieval mereology will be extremely interested in the\nmaximal propositions presented in treatments of the Topic from the\nwhole and the Topic from the part.\n\nFollowing a well-established Ancient tradition, the Topic from the\nwhole is usually divided into two sub-Topics:\n\nThe Topic from the universal whole.\nThe Topic from the integral whole.\n\n\nFrom the beginning, the best medieval philosophers are aware of the\nsubtleties of ordinary language. In particular, they are mindful of\nthe distributive function of the adjectival term \u201cwhole\u201d\n(totus/tota/totum). That is, the term\n\u201ctotus\u201d can act like a universal quantifier and,\nhence, the phrase \u201ctotus x\u201d can mean\n\u201call the parts of x taken together\u201d or \u201cthe\nentire x\u201d (see\n Section 2\n below). This sensitivity to the distributive sense of\n\u201ctotus\u201d might be what motivates medieval\nlogicians to add further refinements to the theory of the Topics.\nSpecifically, the Topic from the whole is routinely divided in a\nsix-fold manner (see, e.g., Peter of Spain Tractatus\nV.11\u201318 (2014, 210\u201319); following Boethius\u2019 terse\nremarks in De topicis differentiis II, 1189A\u2013C; trans.\nStump 1978, 52\u201353). In addition to the Topic from the universal\nwhole and the Topic from the integral whole, there are these\nadditional Topics:\n\nThe Topic from the whole in quantity.\nThe Topic from the whole in a respect (in modo).\nThe Topic from the whole in place.\nThe Topic from the whole in time.\n\n\nThe Topic from the whole in quantity classifies and considers\npropositions where the term is taken universally, such as \u201cEvery\nx is a y\u201d, or \u201cNo x is a\ny\u201d. The Topic from the whole in a respect considers a\nterm in respect to some limiting qualification. So, for example, if\nx is white on its surface, then every part of\nx\u2019s surface is white. The Topic from the whole\nin place classifies propositions bounded by the term\n\u201ceverywhere\u201d or its cognates. So, if water is\neverywhere, then water is here (where\n\u201chere\u201d designates a \u201cpart in place\u201d). And,\nfinally, the Topic from the whole in time considers inferences that\none can make from propositions bounded by the term\n\u201calways\u201d or \u201cnever\u201d.\n\nA full account of medieval mereology would consider carefully the\ndetails of all six sub-Topics. But of special interest to us are the\ntreatments of the Topic from the integral whole and of the Topic from\nthe integral part. In these discussions, medieval philosophers often\nconsider whether the traditional maximal propositions associated with\nthese Topics in fact describe the logical and metaphysical relations\nthat hold between an integral whole and an integral part.\nSpecifically, the maximal proposition that applies to integral wholes\nis:\n\nIf the whole is, then the part is.\n\n\nThe maximal proposition said to apply to the integral part in relation\nto its whole is:\n\nIf the part is not, the whole is not.\n\n\nThese maximal propositions are quite startling. They seem to entail,\nfor example, that if Socrates exists, then his hand must exist, and if\nSocrates\u2019 hand ceases to exist, then Socrates ceases to exist.\nAs we will see in\n Section 4.2,\n such consequences do not escape the notice of medieval philosophers,\nand much of interest regarding the metaphysical implications of the\nTopics and their maximal propositions ensues.\n",
