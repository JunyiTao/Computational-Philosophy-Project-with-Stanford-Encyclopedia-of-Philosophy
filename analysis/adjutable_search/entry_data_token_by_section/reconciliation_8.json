    "main_text": "Processes of Reconciliation || Lustration\n3.6 Lustration\n\nLustration refers to legal measures that permit or require the\ninvestigation of individuals running for election, serving in the\nmilitary, or working in government agencies, universities, or the\nmedia. Individuals found to have connections to past injustices or\nperpetrating groups may then be publicly exposed or excluded from\nserving in public roles (David 2011). Such measures are frequently\nadopted during postwar occupations or in countries transitioning to\ndemocracy. Lustration is sometimes conceived of as a punitive measure,\nwhich opens practitioners up to charges of engaging in collective\nforms of punishment that ignore individual desert and violating\nprohibitions on retroactive law (Cohen 1995, Meierhenrich 2006).\nLustration has also been defended in forward-looking terms as a means\nof securing peace or a political transition as well as reestablishing\ntrust in government by assuring the public that past wrongdoers will\nno longer be in power (Chiu 2011). Criticisms of lustration as a means\nof pursuing political reconciliation highlight the potential for\nbiased application of the law (Cohen 1995), warn of the difficulties\nof re-establishing a functional government when much of the\nexperienced and educated workforce is excluded from participation\n(Hollywood 2007), and worry that lustration encourages the\ncontinuation of suspicion rather than cooperation among former enemies\n(Govier 2006).\n",
