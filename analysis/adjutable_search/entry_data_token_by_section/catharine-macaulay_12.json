    "main_text": "Thoughts on progress, liberty and education || Feminism\n5.3 Feminism\n\nOne reason why Catharine Macaulay\u2019s work has not received as much\nattention as it arguably deserves, is that contemporary interest in\nthe writings of historical women has tended to be motivated by\nfeminism, and some earlier commentators suggested that Macaulay was\nuninterested in the rights of women (Staves 1989). More recently, her\neducational views, commitment to acknowledging the influence of\nhistorical women, and recognition of her influence on Wollstonecraft\nis resulting in a fairer assessment of her importance to the history\nof English feminism (Gunther-Canada 1998, 2003; Hicks 2002; Hill 1995;\nTitone 2004; Berges 2013).\n\nIn speaking of the education of girls, Macaulay asserts, \u201cmy\npride and my prejudices lead me to regard my sex in a higher light\nthan as the mere objects of sense\u201d (Macaulay 1790, 62). Indeed,\nshe believes that both sexes ought to aspire to virtue, which, since\nit involves understanding and acting on moral principles discernible\nby reason, is the same for both sexes. In order to justify the\negalitarian educational program that she proposes, she argues against\nRousseau that there are no characteristic differences between the\nsexes, that most of what is observed is the result of education, and,\nturning Pope\u2019s words around, that \u201cA perfect man is a woman\nformed after a courser mold\u201d (Macaulay 1790, 204). Against\nRousseau\u2019s attempt to make a single moral person out of the union of\nthe two sexes, she asserts that it outdoes, for contradiction and\nabsurdity, \u201cevery metaphysical riddle that was ever formed in\nthe schools\u201d (Macaulay 1790, 206).\n\nMary Wollstonecraft favourably reviewed Macaulay\u2019s Letters on\nEducation in November 1790, commenting on Macaulay\u2019s chapter\ntitled, \u201cNo characteristic difference in sex\u201d that\n\u201cthe observations on this subject might have been carried much\nfarther\u201d (Wollstonecraft 1989, 7.31; Hill 1995; Coffee 2019). Her\nVindication of the Rights of Women does exactly that,\nextending Macaulay\u2019s critique of Rousseau, and adding a great deal of\nfurther material criticising other authors who had contributed to\nrendering women objects of contempt. She echoes in her formulations\nthe arguments which Macaulay had given for providing an equal\neducation, according to which \u201cthere is but one rule of right\nfor the conduct of all rational beings \u2026 that true wisdom\n\u2026 is as useful to women as men\u201d and that, as in the next\nworld \u201cour state of happiness may possibly depend on the degree\nof perfection we have attained in this, we cannot justly lessen, in\none sex or the other, the means by which perfection \u2026 is\nacquired\u201d (Macaulay 1790, 201\u20132).\n\nMacaulay\u2019s belief that moral truth is not a matter of mere custom or\nconvention is central to her rejection of the contemporary situation\nof women. For despite the near universal custom of the subjection of\nwomen to the arbitrary power of men, she argues that\n\n\n\u2026 justice, in its more abstract or general sense, should be\nlittle considered, or little understood, by those who can believe that\nit is agreeable to the wisdom and goodness of an all-perfect Being to\nform two species of creatures of equal intelligence and similar\nfeelings, and consequently capable of an equal degree of suffering\nunder injuries, and should consign one of these species as a kind of\nproperty to a different species of their fellow-creatures, not endowed\nwith any qualities of mind sufficient to prevent the enormous abuse of\nsuch a power. (Macaulay 1783, 158)\n\n\nThus, although feminist rhetoric was not central to her histories and\nearlier pamphlets, she was fully convinced that the subjection of\nwomen to men was not compatible with rational principles of justice.\nIndeed, her assertion, in her response to Burke, that there should be\n\u201ca fair and equal representation of the\nwhole people\u201d could be interpreted as implying that she\nbelieved in the representation of women, for her choice in this\ninstance of sex-neutral language is surely intentional.\n",
