    "main_text": "The firm in society || Corporate social responsibility\n7.1 Corporate social responsibility\n\n\u201cCorporate social responsibility\u201d, or CSR, is typically\nunderstood as actions by businesses that are (i) not legally required,\nand (ii) intended to benefit parties other than the corporation (where\nbenefits to the corporation are understood in terms of return on\nequity, return on assets, or some other measure of financial\nperformance). The parties who benefit may be more or less closely\nassociated with the firm itself; they may be the firm\u2019s own\nemployees or people in distant lands.\n\nA famous example of CSR involves the pharmaceutical company Merck. In\nthe late 1970s, Merck was developing a drug to treat parasites in\nlivestock, and it was discovered that a version of the drug might be\nused treat Onchocerciasis, or river blindness, a disease that causes\ndebilitating itching, pain, and eventually blindness in people. The\nproblem was that the drug would cost hundreds of millions of dollars\nto develop, and would generate little or no revenue for Merck, since\nthe people usually afflicted with river blindness were too poor to\nafford it. Ultimately Merck decided to develop the drug. As expected,\nit was effective in treating river blindness, but Merck made no money\nfrom it. As of this writing in 2021, Merck, now in concert with\nseveral nongovernmental organizations, continues to manufacture and\ndistribute the drug throughout the developing world for free.\n\nThe scholarly literature on CSR is dominated by social scientists.\nTheir question is typically whether, when, and how socially\nresponsible actions benefit firms financially. The conventional wisdom\nis that there is a slight positive correlation between corporate\nsocial performance and corporate financial performance, but it is\nunclear which way the causality goes (Vogel 2005; Zhao & Murrell\n2021). That is, it is not clear whether prosocial behavior by firms\ncauses them to be rewarded financially (e.g., by consumers who value\ntheir behavior), or whether financial success allows firms to engage\nin more prosocial behaviors (e.g., by freeing up resources that would\notherwise be spent on core business functions).\n\nMany writers connect the debate about CSR with the debate about the\nends of corporate governance. Thus Friedman (1970) objects to CSR,\nsaying that managers should be maximizing shareholder wealth instead.\n(Friedman also thinks that CSR is a usurpation of the democratic\nprocess and often wasteful, since managers aren\u2019t experts in\nsolving social problems.) Stakeholder theory (Freeman et al. 2010) is\nthought to be more accommodating of prosocial activity by firms, since\nit permits firms to do things other than increase shareholder\nwealth.\n\nWe do not need, however, to see the debate about CSR a debate about\nthe proper ends of corporate governance. We can see it as a debate\nabout the nature and scope of firms\u2019 moral duties, i.e., what\nobligations (e.g., of rescue or beneficence) they must discharge,\nwhatever their goals are (Hsieh 2004; Mejia 2020).\n\nMany writers give broadly consequentialist reasons for CSR. The\narguments tend to go as follows: (1) there are serious problems in the\nworld, such as poverty, conflict, environmental degradation, and so\non; (2) any agent with the resources and knowledge necessary to\nameliorate these problems has a moral responsibility to do so,\nassuming the costs they incur on themselves are not excessively high;\n(3) firms have the resources and knowledge necessary to ameliorate\nthese problems without incurring excessively high costs; therefore,\n(4) firms should ameliorate these problems (Dunfee 2006a).\n\nThe view that someone should do something about the\nworld\u2019s problems seems true to many people. Not only is there an\nopportunity to increase social welfare by alleviating suffering,\nsuffering people may also have a right to assistance. The\ncontroversial issue is who should do something to help, and how much\nthey should do. Thus defenders of the above argument focus most of\ntheir attention on establishing that firms have these duties,\nagainst those who say that these duties are properly assigned to\nstates or individuals. O. O\u2019Neill (2001) and Wettstein (2009)\nargue that firms are \u201cagents of justice\u201d, much like states\nand individuals, and have duties to aid the needy (see also Young\n2011). Strudler (2017) legitimates altruistic behavior by firms by\nundermining the claim that shareholders own them, and so are owed\ntheir surplus wealth. Hsieh (2004) says that, even if we concede that\nfirms do not have social obligations, individuals have them, and the\nbest way for many individuals to discharge them is through the\nactivities of firms (see also McMahon 2013; Mejia 2020).\n\nDebates about CSR are not just debates about whether specific social\nills should be addressed by specific corporations. They are also\ndebates about what sort of society we want to live in. While\nacknowledging that firms benefit society through CSR, Brenkert (1992)\nthinks it is a mistake for people to encourage firms to engage in CSR\nas a practice. When we do so, he says, we cede a portion of the public\nsphere to private actors. Instead of deciding together how we want to\nameliorate social ills affecting our fellow community members, we\nleave it up to private organizations to decide what to do. Instead of\nsharpening our skills of democracy through deliberation and collective\ndecision-making, and reaffirming social bonds through mutual aid, we\nallow our skills and bonds to atrophy through disuse.\n",
