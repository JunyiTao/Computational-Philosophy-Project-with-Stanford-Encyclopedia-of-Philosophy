    "main_text": "Atomism in the Seventeenth Century || Mechanical Reductions and the Problem of Transdiction\n2.2 Mechanical Reductions and the Problem of Transdiction\n\n\nExplaining complex properties by reducing them to more elementary ones\nwas not an enterprise unique to the mechanical philosophers. After\nall, it was a central Aristotelian thesis that the behaviour of\nmaterials was due to the proportions of the four elements in them,\nwhilst the elements themselves owed their properties to the\ninteraction of the hot and the cold and the wet and the dry, the\nfundamental active principles in nature. What a mechanical atomist\nlike Boyle needed, and attempted, to do was establish that they could\nprovide examples of successful mechanical reductions that were clear\nand intelligible. It was to this end that Boyle stressed how the\nworkings of a key could be explained in terms of nothing other than\nits shape and size relative to the lock and the workings of a clock\ncan be explained by appeal to nothing other than the properties of its\nparts.\n\n\nThere is a basic problem with this type of illustration of and support\nfor the mechanical philosophy. Firstly, whilst the examples may indeed\nbe examples of successful reductions, they are not strict mechanical\nreductions, and they are certainly not reductions to the mechanical\nproperties of atoms. The functioning of a key depends on its rigidity\nwhilst that of clocks and watches depend crucially on the weight of\npendulum bobs or the elasticity of springs. On a number of occasions\nBoyle himself observed that explanations that appealed to such things\nas elasticity, gravity, acidity and the like fall short of the kind of\nexplanations sought by a mechanical atomist (Chalmers, 1993).\n To attempt to produce examples of reduction that conform to the\nideal of the mechanical atomists is, in effect, to attempt to bolster\nthe arguments from intelligibility with empirical arguments. The issue\nof empirical support for mechanical atomism, or any other version of\natomism, raises a fundamental problem, a problem that Maurice\nMandelbaum (1964, 88\u2013112) has called \u2018the problem of\ntransdiction\u2019. How are we to reach knowledge of unobservable\natoms from knowledge of the bulk matter to which we have observational\nand experimental access? Mandelbaum credits Boyle with proposing a\nsolution to the problem and he is endorsed by Newman (2006). Roughly\nspeaking, the solution is that knowledge that is confirmed at the\nlevel of observation, that is found to apply to all matter whatsoever,\nand is scale invariant can be assumed to apply to atoms also. There is\nno doubt that an argument of this kind is to be found in Boyle, but it\nis highly problematic and can hardly be regarded as the solution to\nthe epistemological problems faced by a seventeenth-century\natomist.\n\n\nThere is something to be said for an appeal to scale invariance along\nthe lines that laws that are shown to hold at the level of observation\nin a way that is independent of size should be held to hold generally,\nand in particular, on a scale so minute that it is beyond what can be\nobserved. Boyle draws attention to the fact that the law of fall is\nobeyed by objects independently of their size and that the same appeal\nto mechanism can be applied alike to explain the workings of a large\ntown clock and a tiny wristwatch (Stewart, 1979, 143). The question is\nto what extent recognition of scale invariance of this kind can aid\nthe atomist. There is a range of reasons for concluding that it\ncannot.\n\n\nA key problem is that laws established at the level of observation and\nexperiment involve or imply properties other than the primary ones of\nthe mechanical atomist. As mentioned above, the mechanisms of clocks\ninvolve the elasticity of springs, the weight of pendulum bobs and the\nrigidity of gear wheels and the law of fall presupposes a tendency for\nheavy objects to fall \u2018downwards\u2019. So the mechanical\natomist cannot apply knowledge of this kind, scale invariant or\notherwise, to atoms that are presumed to lack such properties. If we\nare looking for an empirical case for the list of properties that can\nbe applied to atoms then it would appear that we need some criteria\nfor picking out that subset of properties possessed by observable\nobjects that can be applied to atoms also. Boyle offered a solution to\nthis problem. He suggested that only those properties that occur in\nall observable objects whatsoever should be transferred to\natoms. Since all observable objects have some definitive shape and\nsize then atoms do also. By contrast, whilst some observable objects\nare magnetic, many are not, and so atoms are not magnetic. This\nstrategy does not give an atomist what is needed. All observable\nobjects are elastic to some degree and are even divisible to some\ndegree and yet mechanical atoms are denied such\nproperties. Conversely, no observable macroscopic object is absolutely\nimpenetrable whereas Boyle assumes that atoms posses precisely that\nproperty. Perhaps it should not be surprising that the mechanical\natomists of the seventeenth century lacked the resources to forge\nlinks between their conjectured atoms and experimental findings.\n",
