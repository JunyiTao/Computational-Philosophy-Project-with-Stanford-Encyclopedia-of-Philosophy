    "main_text": "Categories and Universals || Semantic Categories\n4.1 Semantic Categories\n\nThe categories are categories of simple terms, ultimately concepts\n(e.g., substance, redness) but also the words of\nconventional languages (e.g., \u2018substance,\u2019\n\u2018redness\u2019), that pick out extra-mental things of various\nkinds. Chatton describes a category in the traditional manner as:\n\nan essential order of predicables, through which the intellect is\nnaturally apt to descend from a transcendental concept by dividing and\ncompounding to assemble a specific definition of some thing.\n(Lectura I, d. 8, q. 1, a. 3, paragraph 118)\n\n\nA category is an ordered set of predicates, produced by the activity\nof the intellect, arranged according to degree of generality from a\nmost general genus concept (substance) down to a least\ngeneral species concept (human being), passing through the\nintermediate levels of more or less general genus concepts\n(body, organism, animal). Above the\ncategories are \u2018transcendental\u2019 concepts like\nbeing, which signify the items of more than one category and\nare, therefore, even more general than the concepts of any one\ncategory. Below the categories are individual concepts like this\nhuman being or Socrates that pick out one and only one\nthing.\n\nCategory concepts are important for constructing the definitions with\nwhich we express the essential properties of things. Chatton\u2019s\nparticular interest are the real definitions of species concepts\n\u2013 \u201cspecific definitions\u201d \u2013 and the things that\nthose concepts signify, which are, to use modern terminology, natural\nkinds like human beings and roses. Specific definitions are\nconstructed by compounding a genus concept and an essential difference\nconcept. For example, the definition of human being is\nrational animal, where \u2018rational\u2019 is the\nessential difference and \u2018animal\u2019 is the genus; the\ndefinition of animal is sentient organism, where\n\u2018sentient\u2019 is the essential difference and\n\u2018organism\u2019 the genus. Two key semantic features, connected\nto definitions, were commonly ascribed to category concepts, which are\n(1) essential and (2) universal predicates. The terms\n\u2018animal\u2019 and \u2018sentient\u2019 are essentially\npredicable of each and every term falling under \u2018animal,\u2019\ne.g., \u2018cat,\u2019 \u2018human being,\u2019\n\u2018frog,\u2019 etc., precisely because \u2018animal\u2019 and\n\u2018sentient\u2019 appear in the definitions of \u2018cat,\u2019\netc.\n\nAlthough categorial items are not extra-mental things, Chatton\nmentions classes of categorial things, suggesting there are things in\ncategories and genera. He explains that an individual\n(individuum), an extra-mental thing, is in a category if the\nspecies concept that signifies it can be essentially predicated by all\nthe genus concepts within its categorial line (Lectura I, d.\n8, q. 1, a. 1, paragraph 93). Socrates is in the category of\nsubstance, in a manner of speaking, because substance,\nbody, organism, and animal are all\nessentially predicable of human being and human\nbeing is essentially predicable of the individual concept\nSocrates or this human being, pointing to\nSocrates.\n\nIn asking how we arrive at the canonical ten categories, Chatton\nargues against Peter Auriol and Ockham\u2019s view that the\ncategories are generated by asking ten different questions of a\nsubstance. On this view, the responses to \u201cwhat is it\u201d\nform the category substance (e.g., \u2018animal,\u2019\n\u2018body\u2019), to \u201chow many\u201d or \u201chow\nmuch\u201d form the category quantity (e.g.,\n\u2018three\u2019), to \u201chow is it\u201d form the category\nquality (e.g., \u2018brown,\u2019 \u2018curved\u2019), to\n\u201cwhose is it\u201d or \u201cin respective of what is it\u201d\nform the category relation (e.g., \u2018mother,\u2019\n\u2018similar\u2019) and so on. Chatton objects to this view on\nthree grounds: (1) we can ask many more questions of substance than\nthese ten so the choice is arbitrary without further elaboration; (2)\nwhy limit the questions to questions about substance? Why not ask\n\u201chow much\u201d or \u201cwhat is it\u201d of quality too? And\nfinally (3) God would end up in all or most of the categories since we\ncan ask these questions of him.\n",
