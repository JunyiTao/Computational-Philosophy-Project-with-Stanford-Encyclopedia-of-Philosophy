Reason and Revelation in Dialogue\n\n Having seen the difference between the \u201claws of reason\u201d\nand the \u201claws of revelation,\u201d we get an even better sense\nof Saadya's uniquely religious epistemological stance by looking more\ngenerally at how reason and revelation relate to one another in his\nsystem. Broadly considering ways in which reason and revelation come\ntogether for Saadya, we find the complexity of Saadya's\nepistemological sensibility, the sense, that is, in which revelation\nis both brought in support of, but also itself supported by,\nreason. \n\n First, Saadya provides what he takes to be a reason-based account of\nwhy the \u201claws of reason\u201d were included by God in the\nrevealed Bible at all \u2014 after all, if they are the sorts of\nthings that reasonably sensible human beings ought to arrive at on\ntheir own, why did God bother revealing them? To this question, Saadya\ncan be taken as providing two answers:\n\n 1. God, in His benevolence, did not see fit to leave us to figure\nmorality out on our own; even though we could arrive at certain\nkey moral ideas on the basis of our own human reasoning, God, by\nrevealing these moral ideas to us, essentially gives us a shortcut, as\nit were.\n\n \u2026the Lord (be He exalted and glorified) has informed us\nthrough the words of His prophets that he wishes us to lead a\nreligious life by following the religion which He instituted for\nus. This religion contains laws (shar\u00ee\u2018a), which he\nhas prescribed for us, and which it is our duty to keep and to fulfill\nin sincerity\u2026His messengers established these laws for us by\nwondrous signs and miracles, and we commenced to keep and fulfill them\nforthwith. Later we found that speculation confirms the necessity of\nthe law for us. It would, however, not have been appropriate to\nleave us to our own devices\u2026 (Altmann, 95; italics added)\n\n\n For Saadya, it is only reasonable that God in His kindness reveal to\nus even those laws which we could, in theory, arrive at on the basis\nof our own reasoning, for this both expedites as well as ensures our\nengagement with proper norms for living. Human reason is in this way\nshown to be helped by revelation. And yet, in this very act of\nanalysis \u2014 in which a reasoned account of the importance of\nrevelation is given \u2014 Saadya essentially at one and the same\ntime shows us how revelation is helped \u2014 at least in the sense\nof supported \u2014 by reason.\n\n 2. Following a further line of reasoning (itself outlined more fully\nbelow in our treatment of Saadya's analysis of why God issued\n\u201claws of revelation\u201d), Saadya explains how, by including\n\u201claws of reason\u201d in the list of divinely revealed\ncommandments and prohibitions, God, in effect, allows His subjects to\ndo what they would be doing anyway (viz. acting in accordance with\nbasic, reason-based moral ideals), but enables them to get the\nadditional bonus of being rewarded for \u2018doing God's\nbidding\u2019. \n\n When faced with this statement [viz. that the commandments and\nprohibitions are a divine gift], the first impulse of reason will be\nto object that God should have been able to bestow upon men perfect\nbliss and to grant them everlasting happiness without imposing upon\nthem commandments and prohibitions. Moreover, it would seem that in\nthis way His goodness would have been more beneficial to them, seeing\nthat they would have been free from the necessity of making any\nlaborious effort. My answer to this objection is that, on the\ncontrary, the order instituted by God, whereby everlasting happiness\nis achieved by man's labours in fulfillment of the law, is\npreferable. For reason judges that one who obtains some good in return\nfor work which he has accomplished enjoys a double portion of\nhappiness in comparison with one who has not done any work and\nreceived what he receives as a gift of grace. reason does not deem it\nright to place both on the same level. This being so, our Creator has\nchosen for us the more abundant portion, namely, to bestow welfare on\nus in the shape of reward, thus making it double the benefit which we\ncould expect without an effort on our part\u2026 (Altmann, 94)\n \n\n God gives His followers more opportunity to reap rewards by making\neven the self-evident norms of moral living matters of divine\nobeisance.  We might say that for Saadya, God supplements a natural\nlaw ethics (and/or a Virtue Theory ethics) with a divine command\ntheory for the purpose of increasing human rewards. reason, in this\nway, is helped by revelation. And yet again, in the very composition\nof an account of the reasonableness of revelation, Saadya here too\nshows revelation to be helped \u2014 at least in the sense of\nsupported \u2014 by reason.\n\n Regarding the larger question of obeisance to God, Saadya (in chapter\n3 of the Am\u00e2n\u00e2t) provides what he takes to be a\nreason-based account of why one ought to follow God and obey His laws,\nand can in this way be seen as providing a reason-based appraisal of\nrevelation most broadly construed. This argument is provided in 4\nparts, and centers, in turn, on the reasonableness of God's expecting\nus to render thanks to Him, the reasonableness of God expecting us to\nrespect Him and His name, the reasonableness of God's expecting us to\nact rightly towards fellow humans, and the reasonableness of God's\ngiving us commands and prohibitions for the express purpose of being\nable to give us rewards. In this discussion, Saadya in yet another way\nemploys reason in support of revelation.  Here, revelation is once\nagain helped \u2014 at least in the sense of supported \u2014 by\nreason.\n\n In fact, Saadya even provides what he takes to be a reason-based\naccount of the \u201claws of revelation\u201d \u2014 the very laws\n\u201cregarding which reason passes no judgment\u201d and which, as\nsuch, are not, in his very own opinion on the matter, subject to human\nevaluation at all! According to Saadya, humans don't know what God has\nin mind regarding this class of laws, and yet, champion of reason as\nSaadya appears to be, he nonetheless decides (albeit tentatively, and\nwith qualification) to provide reasons for these laws. In fact, Saadya\nnot only gives reasons for the \u201claws of revelation\u201d as a\nclass of law in general, but he then additionally offers explanations\nfor the particularities of individual cases in point of such laws. In\nthis latter effort, Saadya not only provides numerous possible reasons\nfor the particularities of any given \u201claw of revelation,\u201d\nbut attempts in his explanations to show how the law in question is\nactually of practical benefit to humans. \n\n Starting with the first, more general level of explanation, Saadya\nprovides a reason for God's having commanded \u201claws of\nrevelation\u201d broadly speaking: First, it was a benevolent act\ndesigned by God to give humans extra opportunities to serve Him, and,\nthereby, extra opportunities to increase their rewards and\nhappiness:\n\n But our Lord has given us an abundance of such commandments and\nprohibitions [viz. laws of revelation] in order to increase our reward\nand happiness through them, as is said, \u2018The Lord was pleased,\nfor His righteousness\u2019 sake, to make the law great and\nglorious\u2019 (Isa. 42.21). That which belongs to the things\ncommanded by God assumes the character of \u2018good\u2019, and that\nwhich belongs to the things forbidden by Him assumes the character of\n\u2018evil\u2019 on account of the Service thereby\nperformed\u2026\u201d (Altmann, 97-98)\n \n\n By having more opportunities to serve God, we are given more\nopportunities to reap divine rewards. For Saadya, nothing could be\nmore reasonable.\n\n An example, then, of Saadya's subsequent attempt to provide even\nfurther reasons for the particulars of specific \u201claws of\nrevelation\u201d (reasons, moreover, which point to the practical\nbenefits of those laws) can be seen in his two attempted explanations\nof the Jewish dietary laws:\n\n The prohibition not to eat certain animals has this advantage: it\nmakes it impossible to liken any of the animals to the Creator since\nit is unthinkable that one should permit oneself either to eat or to\ndeclare as impure what one likens to God; also it prevents people from\nworshiping any of the animals, since it is unthinkable that one should\nworship either what serves for food or what one declares as impure\n(Altmann, 101)\n \n\n In both his more general and more individualized attempts to explain\nthe reasonableness of the \u201claws of revelation,\u201d Saadya\nonce again employs reason in support of revelation. \n\n And yet, turning to some stronger senses in which, on the contrary,\nreason is supported by revelation, Saadya (in a section in chapter 3\nof the Am\u00e2n\u00e2t addressing why it is necessary for\nGod to send \u201cmessengers and prophets\u201d) provides a general\nexplanation not only (as above) of why the \u201claws of\nreason\u201d are themselves revealed, but of why the \u201claws of\nreason\u201d must be further accompanied by additional revealed\ninformation. In this discussion, Saadya stresses that even the most\nrational moral ideal is beset with vagueness about the details of how\nbest to effect the sought after result; and so, while reason can tell\nus that we ought not commit adultery, it doesn't necessarily provide\nus with the sorts of \u2018when, where and how\u2019 details\nthat are needed to translate even the best moral theory into\nactual practice. In effect, Saadya explains that,\n\n \u2026mankind is fundamentally in need of the prophets, not solely\non account of the revelational laws, which had to be announced, but\nalso on account of the rational laws, because their practice cannot be\ncomplete unless the prophets show us how to perform them. Thus, for\ninstance, reason commands gratitude toward God for the blessings\nreceived from Him, but does not specify the form, time, and posture\nappropriate to the expression of such gratitude. So we are in need of\nprophets. They gave it a form which is called \u2018prayer\u2019;\nthey fixed its times, its special formulae, its special modes and the\nspecial direction which one is to face when praying\u2026 (Altmann,\n103-104)\n \n\n In one sense, this too can be seen as another reason (supplementing\nthe two provided above) why the \u201claws of reason\u201d are\nthemselves revealed in the Bible: different from anything addressed\nabove, here the idea would be that the Biblical revelation includes\ndetails for action that human reason on its own does not provide. And\nyet, it seems worth noting that Saadya in this section of his text (as\nrepresented by the above quote) seems to focus explicitly on those\nrequisite details that are provided by the rabbinic tradition\n(details about times of prayer, etc.). This seems to suggest that this\nline of reasoning about the relationship of reason and revelation is\nslightly different from what we have addressed above. And so: whereas\nabove, the question was \u2018Why are the \u201claws of\nreason\u201d revealed in the Bible?\u2019, here, the question is\n\u2018Why are the \u201claws or reason\u201d accompanied by\nrevealed Oral law traditions about these laws?\u2019 Seeing Saadya's\nline of reasoning here in this way, we may highlight the link between\nthe notions of revelation, prophecy and tradition, here precisely in\nthe sense of rabbinic tradition. As discussed above, for Saadya, the\nauthority of the written Bible and the oral law (or, rabbinic\ntradition) are on equal footing.  Here again, though now with\nimplications for the role of rabbinic tradition, we see that, for\nSaadya, reason is helped by revelation (here, it would seem, in the\nsense of rabbinic tradition).\n\n In further support of some stronger senses in which Saadya employs\nrevelation in support of reason, there seems to emerge what we might\nidentify as a kind of \u2018illuminationist\u2019 strain in Saadya's\nepistemology, a strain in light of which human reason seems ultimately\ngrounded upon a personal divine revelation of sorts. Consider how\nSaadya, right at the Am\u00e2n\u00e2t's outset, revealingly\nqualifies the nature of human reason in a discussion of his own role\nas \u2018knower\u2019 through an especially evocative image of\nsinking men in the hands of a salvific diver. Describing his reaction\nto the state of his community's ignorance and doubt, Saadya says:\n\n \u2026my heart grieved for my race, the race of mankind, and my\nsoul was moved on account of our own people Israel, as I saw in my\ntime many of the believers clinging to unsound doctrine and mistaken\nbeliefs while many of those who deny the faith boast of their unbelief\nand despise the men of truth, although they are themselves in error. I\nsaw men sunk, as it were, in a sea of doubt and covered by the waters\nof confusion, and there was no diver to bring them up from the depths\nand no swimmer to come to their rescue. But as my Lord has granted\nunto me some knowledge which I can use for their support, and endowed\nme with some ability which I might employ for their benefit, I felt\nthat to help them was my duty, and guiding them aright an obligation\nupon me, as the Prophet says, \u201cThe Lord God hath given me the\ntongue of them that are taught, that I should know how to sustain with\nwords him that is weary\u201d (Isa.  50.4), although I confess to the\nshortcomings of my knowledge\u2026 (Altmann, 29)\n \n\n Saadya sees himself as the able swimmer setting out to rescue the\npeople Israel \u2014 and all of mankind \u2014 from their drowning\nfates, and yet, in his image, his own reliance upon the hand of God is\nimmediately evident: Saadya sees himself as the salvific diver, or, to\nchange imagery, the \u2018tongue\u2019 that through books might\nspeak people out of their quandaries, and yet, as he states above, it\nis \u201cmy Lord [who] has granted unto me some knowledge\u2026 and\nendowed me with some ability.\u201d Finding in himself a guiding\nvoice, he is quick to find too that his is a voice that is received\nfrom above: His voice is that of the \u201cthem that are\ntaught\u201d \u2014 his ability to help save those who are drowning\nis not his own, but is, rather, \u2018taught,\u2019 a gift given to\nhim by God. \n\n In this, there emerges an important sense in which, for Saadya,\nreason rests on a kind of personal revelation. And so, here too,\nrevelation is ultimately brought in support of reason.\n\n The importance of revelation as a ground in Saadya can be further\nseen in his understanding of the commandments and prohibitions as\nthemselves gracious gifts from God:\n\n The first of His acts of kindness towards His creatures was the gift\nof existence\u2026Thereafter He offered them a gift by means of which\nthey are able to obtain complete happiness and perfect bliss\u2026\n(Altmann, 93)\n \n\n In his sensitive responsiveness to even existence itself as divine\ngift, Saadya finds in the commandments and prohibitions of revelation\na God-given path to salvation: by following these God-given precepts,\none can hope to secure his or her welfare. In this, his understanding\nof Jewish law as heavenly gift, we can already see the sense in which\nfor Saadya, revelation is a ground for living \u2014 it is the basis\nupon which a person can live in the light of divine favor.\n",
