    "main_text": "Background: Sophists and Scientists\n10. Background: Sophists and Scientists\n\nAristophanes depicted Socrates in the Clouds (421 BCE) as a\nparticipant in the two revolutions that constituted the new learning\nof the period, which were both exciting and disturbing to ordinary\nAthenians: one introduced by the new science, and the other by the\ntravelling teachers known as sophists. \n\nNatural scientists. Thinkers of the period were developing\nexplanations for natural phenomena that displaced the gods from their\ntraditional roles as causes. Socrates is depicted in the\nClouds as involved in this sort of explanation. But Plato\ntakes pains in the Apology and later works to show that the\nmature Socrates is not interested in this project (Phaedo\n96a\u2013d, Phaedrus 229c\u2013e).\n\nSophists.\n \n The Fifth Century saw an explosion of interest in traveling teachers,\nlater known as sophists, who taught a number of subjects, including\nthe art of words, later known as rhetoric. Although the art of words\nwas widely used for entertainment, it also had applications in\ndeliberative and forensic contexts, and the sophists were accused of\nteaching their pupils how to win on behalf of a bad cause\u2014by\nmaking the worse argument into the stronger. Socrates is accused of\nthis in the Clouds: a student emerges from his instruction\nwith an argument that purports to justify a son\u2019s whipping his\nfather.\n\nClever techniques of argument were taught by some sophists, as were\nserious devices for the effective staging of adversary debate, on\nwhich the city-states of those periods depended, both for decisions\nabout policy and for verdicts in criminal cases. Some people felt that\nthese techniques corrupted political and legal processes. Plato took\npains to depict Socrates not only as different from the sophists, but\nas opposed to them on many points. This is a theme in several\ndialogues in our group: Euthydemus, Hippias Minor,\nHippias Major, and Protagoras.\n",
