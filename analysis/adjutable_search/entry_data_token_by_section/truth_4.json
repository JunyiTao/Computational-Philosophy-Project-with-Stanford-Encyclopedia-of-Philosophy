Many of these modern\ntheories, notably correspondence theories, draw on ideas developed by\nTarski.\n\nIn this regard, it is important to bear in mind that his seminal work\non truth (1935) is very much of a piece with other works in\nmathematical logic, such as his (1931), and as much as anything this\nwork lays the ground-work for the modern subject of model theory\n\u2013 a branch of mathematical logic, not the metaphysics of truth.\nIn this respect, Tarski\u2019s work provides a set of highly useful\ntools that may be employed in a wide range of philosophical projects.\n(See Patterson (2012) for more on Tarski\u2019s work in its\nhistorical context.)\n\nTarski\u2019s work has a number of components, which we will consider\nin turn.\n",
