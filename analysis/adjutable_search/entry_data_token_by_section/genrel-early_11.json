This particular argument for metric\nconventionalism has generated substantial controversy on its own, but\nis better understood through an account of its genesis in\nReichenbach\u2019s early neo-Kantianism. Independently of that\ngenesis, the thesis becomes the paradigmatic illustration of\nReichenbach\u2019s broad methodological claim that conventional or\ndefinitional elements\u2014\u201ccoordinative definitions\u201d\nassociating mathematical concepts of the physical theory with\n\u201celements of physical reality\u201d\u2014are a necessary\ncondition for empirical cognition in the mathematical sciences of\nnature. At the same time, Reichenbach\u2019s thesis of metrical\nconventionalism is part and parcel of an audacious program of\nepistemological reductionism regarding spacetime structures. This was\nfirst attempted in his \u201cconstructive axiomatization\u201d\n(1924) of the theory of relativity on the basis of \u201celementary\nmatters of fact\u201d (Elementartatbestande) regarding the\nobservable behavior of lights rays, and rods and clocks. Here, and in\nthe more widely read treatment (1928), metrical properties of\nspacetime are deemed less fundamental than topological ones, while the\nlatter are derived from the concept of time ordering. But time order\nin turn is reduced to that of causal order and so the whole edifice of\nstructures of spacetime is considered epistemologically derivative,\nresting upon ultimately basic empirical facts about causal order and a\nprohibition against action-at-a-distance. The end point of\nReichenbach\u2019s epistemological analysis of the foundations of\nspacetime theory is then \u201cthe causal theory of time\u201d, a\ntype of relational theory of time that assumes the validity of the\ncausal principle of action-by-contact\n(Nahewirkungsprinzip).\n\nHowever, Reichenbach\u2019s first monograph on relativity (1920) was\nwritten from within a neo-Kantian perspective. As Friedman (1994) and\nothers (Ryckman 2005) have discussed in detail Reichenbach\u2019s\ninnovation, a modification of the Kantian conception of synthetic\na priori principles, rejecting the sense of \u201cvalid for all\ntime\u201d while retaining that of \u201cconstitutive of the object\n(of knowledge)\u201d, led to the conception of a theory-specific\n\u201crelativized a priori\u201d. According to Reichenbach,\nany physical theory presupposes the validity of systems of certain,\nquite general, principles which however may vary from theory to\ntheory. These coordinating principles, as they are then\ntermed, are indispensable for the ordering of perceptual data; they\ndefine the objects of knowledge within the theory. The epistemological\nsignificance of relativity theory, according to the early Reichenbach,\nis to have shown, contrary to Kant, that these systems may contain\nmutually inconsistent principles, and so require emendation to remove\ncontradictions. Thus a \u201crelativization\u201d of the Kantian\nconception of synthetic a priori principles is the direct\nepistemological result of the theory of relativity. But this finding\nis also taken to signal a transformation in the method of\nepistemological investigation of science. In place of Kant\u2019s\n\u201canalysis of Reason\u201d, \u201cthe method of analysis of\nscience\u201d (der wissenschaftsanalytische Methode) is\nproposed as \u201cthe only way that affords us an understanding of\nthe contribution of our reason to knowledge\u201d (1920: 71 [1965:\n74]). The method\u2019s raison d\u2019\u00eatre is to\nsharply distinguish between the subjective role of (coordinating)\nprinciples\u2014\u201cthe contribution of Reason\u201d\u2014and\nthe contribution of objective reality, represented by theory-specific\nempirical laws and regularities (\u201caxioms of connection\u201d)\nwhich in some sense have been \u201cconstituted\u201d by the former.\nRelativity theory itself is a shining exemplar of this method for it\nhas shown that the metric of spacetime describes an \u201cobjective\nproperty\u201d of the world, once the subjective freedom to make\ncoordinate transformations (the coordinating principle of general\ncovariance) is recognized (1920: 86\u20137 [1965: 90]). The thesis of\nmetric conventionalism had yet to appear.\n\nBut soon it did. Still in 1920, Schlick objected, both publicly and in\nprivate correspondence with Reichenbach, that \u201cprinciples of\ncoordination\u201d were precisely statements of the kind that\nPoincar\u00e9 had termed \u201cconventions\u201d (see Coffa 1991:\n201ff.). Moreover, Einstein, in a lecture of January 1921, entitled\n\u201cGeometry and Experience\u201d, appeared to lend support to\nthis view. Einstein argued that the question concerning the nature of\nspacetime geometry becomes an empirical question only on certain\npro tem stipulations regarding the \u201cpractically rigid\nbody\u201d of measurement (pro tem in view of the\ninadmissibility in relativity theory of the concept \u201cactually\nrigid body\u201d). In any case, by 1922, the essential pieces of\nReichenbach\u2019s mature conventionalist view had emerged. The\nargument is canonically presented in \u00a78 (entitled \u201cThe\nRelativity of Geometry\u201d) of Der Philosophie der\nRaum-Zeit-Lehre (completed in 1926, published in 1928). In a move\nsuperficially similar to the argument of Einstein\u2019s\n\u201cGeometry and Experience\u201d, Reichenbach maintained that\nquestions concerning the empirical determination of the metric of\nspacetime must first confront the fact that only the whole theoretical\nedifice comprising both geometry and physics admits of observational\ntest. Einstein\u2019s gravitational theory is such a totality.\nHowever, unlike Einstein, Reichenbach\u2019s \u201cmethod of\nanalysis of science\u201d, later re-named \u201clogical analysis of\nscience\u201d, is directed to the epistemological problem of\nfactoring this totality into its conventional or definitional and its\nempirical components.\n\nThis is done as follows. The empirical determination of the spacetime\nmetric by measurement requires choice of some \u201cmetrical\nindicators\u201d: this can only be done by laying down a\ncoordinative definition stipulating, e.g., that the metrical\nnotion of length is coordinated to some physical object or process. A\nstandard choice coordinates lengths with \u201cinfinitesimal\nmeasuring rods\u201d supposed rigid (e.g., Einstein\u2019s\n\u201cpractically rigid body\u201d). This however is only a\nconvention, and other physical objects or processes might be chosen.\n(In Schlick\u2019s fanciful example, the Dali Lama\u2019s heartbeat\ncould be chosen as the physical process to which units of time are\ncoordinated.) Of course, the chosen metrical indicators must be\ncorrected for certain distorting effects (temperature, magnetism,\netc.) due to the presence of physical forces. Such forces are termed\n\u201cdifferential forces\u201d to indicate that they affect various\nmaterials differently. However, Reichenbach argued, the choice of a\nrigid rod as standard of length is tantamount to the claim that there\nare no non-differential\u2014\u201cuniversal\u201d\u2014distorting\nforces that affect all bodies in the same way and cannot be screened\noff. In the absence of \u201cuniversal forces\u201d the coordinative\ndefinition regarding rigid rods can be implemented and the nature of\nthe spacetime metric empirically determined, for example, finding that\npaths of light rays through solar gravitational field are not\nEuclidean straight lines. Thus, the theory of general relativity, on\nadoption of the coordinative definition of rigid rods\n(\u201cuniversal forces = 0\u201d), affirms that the geometry of\nspacetime in a given region is of a non-euclidean kind. The point,\nhowever, is that this conclusion rests on the convention governing\nmeasuring rods. One could, alternately, maintain that the geometry of\nspacetime was Euclidean by adopting a different coordinative\ndefinition, for example, holding that measuring rods expanded or\ncontracted depending on their location in spacetime, a choice\ntantamount to the supposition of \u201cuniversal forces\u201d. Then,\nconsistent with all empirical phenomena, it could be maintained that\nEuclidean geometry was compatible with Einstein\u2019s theory if only\none allowed the existence of such forces. Thus whether general\nrelativity affirms a Euclidean or a non-euclidean metric in the solar\ngravitational field rests upon a conventional choice regarding the\nexistence of non-zero universal forces. Either hypothesis may be\nadopted since they are empirically equivalent descriptions; their\njoint possibility is referred to as \u201cthe relativity of\ngeometry\u201d. Just as with the choice of standard synchrony in\nReichenbach\u2019s analysis of the conventionality of simultaneity, a\nchoice also held to be \u201clogically arbitrary\u201d, Reichenbach\nrecommends the \u201cdescriptively simpler\u201d alternative in\nwhich universal forces do not exist. To be sure, \u201c descriptive\nsimplicity has nothing to do with truth\u201d, i.e., has no bearing\non the question of whether the spacetime metric really has a\nnon-Euclidean structure (1928: 47 [1958: 35]).\n",
