    "main_text": "Game Structure and Game Logics || Simultaneous Moves and Imperfect Information\n2.8 Simultaneous Moves and Imperfect Information\n\nIn the extensive form games of\n Section 2.1,\n players move in sequence and can base their decisions on full\ninformation of what has happened so far. The other extreme were games\nin strategic form, where agents move in parallel or, in the\ninterpretation of strategy selection, have no means of picking up\ninformation during actual play. There are ample scenarios in between\nthese extremes. Public good games with optional retribution against\nnon-cooperators (Andrighetto et al.\n2013), for instance, combine moments where some or all players\nmake simultaneous moves with information collection along the way.\nSuch parallel action can be mimicked in sequential games by limiting\nthe information available to players at various states of the game.\nThe resulting games of imperfect information will be discussed in\n Section 3,\n alongside other sources of imperfect information.\n\nFurther well-known logical approaches to parallel action employ STIT\nlogic (Horty & Belnap 1995; Broersen\n2009), and temporal logics such as ATL (Alur,\nHenzinger, & Kupferman 2002) or its\nepistemic variant ATEL (van der Hoek &\nWooldridge 2003).\n\n",
