    "main_text": "Life and Works || Works\n1.2 Works\n\nOne work of Ammonius clearly survives in the written form he gave it,\nhis \u2018commentary\u2019 (hupomn\u0113ma) on\nAristotle\u2019s De Interpretatione. His commentary on\nPorphyry\u2019s Introduction (in Isag.), is\ndescribed in the manuscripts variously as \u2018Ammonius the\nPhilosopher\u2019s Exegesis (or Prolegomena or Commentary) of the\nFive Sayings\u2019 and is perhaps another work given its final form\nby Ammonius; but its present Prooemium is, in any case, considered\ninauthentic, and other passages are also interpolations (Busse,\nCAG IV.3 p. vi).\n\nWe hear of other works published by Ammonius, but these are mostly\nsingle book-rolls, monographs on particular points:\n\nOn Phaedo 69d4\u20136, in which he defended Plato\nagainst the charge that in the Phaedo he was ambivalent about\nthe immortality of the soul (Olympiodorus, in Phd. 8\n\u00a717,6\u20137).\nOn hypothetical syllogisms (fragment at Ammonius, in An.\nPr. 67,32\u201369,28).\nOn the fact that Aristotle made God not only the final but also\nthe efficient cause of the whole world (Simplicius, in Cael.\n271,13\u201321, in Phys. 1363,8\u201312).\nOn the Astrolabe. That Ammonius wrote on this topic is mentioned\nby Philoponus at the start of his own book on the use, construction,\nand inscriptions of the astrolabe. A work entitled \u201cExplanation\nof the use of the astrolabe\u201d, said in the manuscripts to be by\none \u2018Aegyptius\u2019, is thought rather to be the work of\nAmmonius, perhaps an epitome of a lost work of his (cf. Hase 1839,\n158\u2013171 and Pingree 1973, 33 n. 7). Ammonius taught Damascius\nPtolemy\u2019s Syntaxis and was known, along with his\nbrother Heliodorus, for his work on astronomy (cf. the\nobservations\u2014one said to have been made by the brothers\ntogether, on 22 Feb. 503\u2014recorded by Heliodorus in his copy of\nPtolemy: Heiberg 1907, xxxv-xxxvii).\n\n\nIn addition, the commentary by an Ammonius on Aristotle\u2019s\nTopics mentioned in Syriac and Arabic authors was perhaps\nwritten by our Ammonius (cf. Stump 1978, 212 and Militello 2014, 92).\n\n\nThe other works of Ammonius which survive are all derived, directly or\nindirectly, from his lectures, taken down by his students and hence\nmostly described as being \u2018from the voice (apo t\u0113s\nph\u014dn\u0113s, or: the lectures [skhol\u014dn]) of\nAmmonius\u2019. Two of these are transmitted under the name of\nAmmonius himself, but are thought to come from the notes of anonymous\nstudents from Ammonius\u2019 lectures:\n\nOn Aristotle\u2019s Categories (in Cat.):\n\u2018Prolegomena to the Ten Categories from the Voice of Ammonius\nthe Philosopher\u2019.\nOn Aristotle\u2019s Prior Analytics I (in An.\nPr.): \u2018Notes (skholia) on the first book of the\nPrior Analytics from the Voice of Ammonius\u2019.\n\n\nTwo courses bear the name of Asclepius (ca. 465- ?):\n\nOn Aristotle\u2019s Metaphysics 1\u20137\n(in Metaph.); the title of the first book of this commentary\nis: \u2018Notes on the greater first book of the Metaphysics  of\nAristotle coming from Asclepius from the Voice of\nAmmonius\u2019.\nOn Nicomachus\u2019 Introduction to Arithmetic (in\nNicomachi Intro. Arith.): \u2018Asclepius the Philosopher of\nTralles\u2019 Notes on the first book of the Arithmetical\nIntroduction of Nicomachus\u2019.\n\n\nFour courses are transmitted under the name of John Philoponus (ca.\n490-ca. 570):\n\nOn Aristotle\u2019s Prior Analytics (in An.\nPr.): \u2018John the Grammarian of Alexandria\u2019s school\nannotations (skholikai apos\u0113mei\u014dseis) on the first\nbook of the Prior Analytics from the seminars of Ammonius son of\nHermeias\u2019.\nOn Aristotle\u2019s Posterior Analytics (in An.\nPost.): \u2018John of Alexandria\u2019s school annotations from\nthe seminars of Ammonius son of Hermeias with some of his own\nobservations (epistaseis) on the first book of the Posterior\nAnalytics\u2019 (what is transmitted as the commentary on Book II is\nperhaps spurious).\nOn Aristotle\u2019s On Generation and Corruption (in\nGC): \u2018John the Grammarian of Alexandria\u2019s school\nannotations from the seminars of Ammonius son of Hermeias with some of\nhis own observations on the first of the books On Generation and\nCorruption of Aristotle\u2019.\nOn Aristotle\u2019s On the Soul (in DA;\nauthorship of the commentary on Book III is disputed): \u2018John of\nAlexandria\u2019s school annotations from the seminars of Ammonius\nson of Hermeias with some of his own observations on Aristotle\u2019s\nOn the Soul\u2019.\n\n\nThe titles of three of Philoponus\u2019 Aristotle courses do not\nmention Ammonius, and these were probably perceived as representing\nrather the lectures of Philoponus than those of Ammonius. These are:\n\n\nOn Aristotle\u2019s Categories (in Cat.); but\nthis might have been based on the notes published under\nAmmonius\u2019 own name.\nOn Aristotle\u2019s Physics (in Phys.):\n\u2018John Philoponus on the first book of Aristotle\u2019s Lecture\non Physics\u2019; this mentions the date of 10 May 517, when Ammonius\nwas still alive, but shows signs of later revision.\nOn Aristotle\u2019s Meteorology (in\nMeteor.).\n\n\nHowever, On Nicomachus\u2019 Introduction to Arithmetic\n(in Nicomachi Intro. Arith.) is thought to be lectures by\nPhiloponus based on Asclepius\u2019 publication (see above) of his\nown notes on Ammonius\u2019 lectures (cf. Tar\u00e1n 1969,\n10\u201313).\n",
