Those who take\nsupersubstantivalism to be a necessary truth are likely to be hostile\nto the possibility of extended simples\u2014or at least to the\npossibility of extended simple material objects. For they are likely\nto endorse the following argument:\n\n(9)\nNecessarily, all material objects are regions.\n(10)\nNecessarily, all extended regions are complex.\nTherefore\n(11)\nNecessarily, all extended material objects are complex. In other\nwords, it is impossible for a material object to be an extended\nsimple.\n\n\nMost defenders of extended simples will resist this argument by\ndenying (9). They tend to think of material objects as being\nnon-identical to, and indeed mereologically disjoint from, the regions\nat which they are exactly located (Markosian 1998; McDaniel 2007b,\n2009; Parsons 2007; Saucedo 2011). A different option is to reject\n(10) in favor of the view that there are, or at least could be,\nextended simple spacetime regions (Braddon-Mitchell and Miller\n2006).\n\nThe above argument yields only a weak, restricted version of NXS, the\nban on extended simples. It leaves open the possibility of extended\nsimples that are not material objects.\n\nNXS does follow from Supersubstantivalism+, according to which it's a\nnecessary truth that each entity is identical to anything at which it\nis exactly located. For suppose that x is exactly located at\ny and that y is complex. Then, given\nSupersubstantivalism+, x=y, hence x is complex\ntoo.\n",
