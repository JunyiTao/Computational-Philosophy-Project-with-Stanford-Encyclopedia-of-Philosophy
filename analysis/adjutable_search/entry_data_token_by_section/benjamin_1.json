Early Works: Kant and Experience\n\n\nThe importance of Benjamin\u2019s early unpublished fragments for an\nunderstanding his wider philosophical project has been emphasised by a\nnumber of scholars (Wolfharth 1992; Caygill 1998; Rrenban 2005).\nIndeed, without them it becomes difficult to understand the\nintellectual context and historical tradition out of which Benjamin is\nwriting and therefore nearly impossible to grasp the philosophical\nunderpinnings of his works. Of Benjamin\u2019s earliest published\nwriting his attempt in the essay entitled \u2018Experience\u2019\n(\u2018Erfahrung\u2019, 1913/1914) to distinguish an\nalternative and superior concept of experience provides a useful\nintroduction to a central and enduring preoccupation of his\nthought. Benjamin\u2019s concern with delineating an immediate and\nmetaphysical experience of spirit is valuable in providing a thematic\ndescription of a conceptual opposition working throughout his\nthought. Filtered here through the cultural ideals of the Youth\nMovement, this contrasts the empty, spiritless [Geistlosen]\nand unartistic \u201cexperiences\u201d accumulated over a life\nmerely lived-through [erlebt] with that privileged kind of\nexperience which is filled with spiritual content through its enduring\ncontact with the dreams of youth (SW 1, 3\u20136). The influence of\nNietzsche in these earlier texts is discernible (McFarland 2013),\nparticularly, in the importance the young Benjamin places upon\naesthetic experience in overcoming the embittered nihilism of\ncontemporary values (although he is unable to articulate this cultural\ntransformation here beyond a vague appeal to the canon of German\npoets: Schiller, Goethe, H\u00f6lderlin, and Stefan George).\nBy 1918 the attempt at a more systematic and philosophically\nsophisticated understanding of a \u201chigher concept of\nexperience\u201d (SW 1, 102) within what Benjamin now calls \u201cthe\ncoming philosophy\u201d is articulated in relation to Kant\u2019s\ntranscendental idealism. Benjamin argues that the value of Platonic and\nKantian philosophy lies in its attempt to secure the scope and depth of\nknowledge through justification, exemplified in the way Kant conducts a\ncritical inquiry into the transcendental conditions of knowledge. But\nthis Kantian attempt to grasp a certain and timeless knowledge is in\nturn based upon an empirical concept of experience which is restricted,\nBenjamin argues, to that \u201cnaked, primitive, self evident\u201d\nexperience of the Enlightenment, whose paradigm is Newtonian physics\n(SW 1, 101). Despite Kant\u2019s introduction of a transcendental\nsubject, his system remains tied to a na\u00efve empiricist\nunderstanding of experience, of the kind privileged in the positivist\nscientific tradition as the encounter between a distinct subject\n(conceived as a cognizing consciousness receiving sensible intuitions)\nand object (understood as a sensation-causing thing-in-itself).\nIn contrast, the pre-Enlightenment concept of experience invested\nthe world with a deeper and more profound significance, because the\nCreation assumes a revelatory religious importance. This is apparent\nnot only in the deeply Christian world-view of mediaeval Europe, but\nsurvives in secularized form in Renaissance and Baroque humanism, and\nin \u201cCounter-Enlightenment\u201d thinkers such as J. G. Hamann,\nGoethe, and the Romantics. Benjamin suggests that the \u201cgreat\ntransformation and correction which must be performed upon the concept\nof experience, oriented so one-sidedly along mathematical-mechanical\nlines, can be attained only by relating knowledge to language, as was\nattempted by Hamann during Kant\u2019s lifetime\u201d (SW 1, 107\u20138).\nIn the essay \u2018On Language as Such and the Language of Man\u2019\n(\u2018\u00dcber Sprache \u00fcberhaupt und \u00fcber die Sprache\ndes Menschen\u2019, c. 1916), Benjamin offers a theological\nconception of language which draws on Hamann\u2019s discussion of Creation\nas the physical imprint of the divine Word of God, to claim that there\n\u201cis no event or thing in either animate or inanimate nature that\ndoes not in some way partake of language\u201d (SW 1,\n62\u20133). This implies that all experience\u2014including\nperception\u2014is essentially linguistic, whilst all human language\n(including writing, typically associated with mere convention) is\ninherently expressive and creative.  Language is privileged as a model\nof experience in these early essays precisely because it undermines\nand transgresses the neat divisions and limitations operating in the\nKantian system, including that fundamental one that distinguishes\nbetween the subject and object of sensations. If both are\nconstitutively linguistic, language serves as a medium of experience\nthat binds the ostensible \u201csubject\u201d and\n\u201cobject\u201d in a more profound, perhaps mystical,\nrelationship of underlying kinship. More generally, Hamann\u2019s\nmetacritique provides Benjamin with a sense of the hypocrisy of the\nKantian separation of understanding and sensibility on the basis of an\nempty and purely formal notion of pure reason, which can itself only\nbe postulated according to the concrete, aesthetic content of\nlanguage.\n\nWhilst Benjamin is not interested in returning to the pre-critical\nproject of a rationalist deduction of experience, nor to a directly\nreligious conception of the world, he is interested in how the\nscientific concept of experience that Kant is utilising distorts the\nstructure of Kant\u2019s philosophical system, and how this might be\ncorrected with the use of theological concepts. Epistemology must\naddress not only \u201cthe question of the certainty of knowledge that\nis lasting\u201d, but also the neglected question of \u201cthe\nintegrity of an experience that is ephemeral\u201d (SW 1, 100).\nBenjamin\u2019s suggestion as to how this project might be formulated\nwithin the Kantian system is sketchy, but nonetheless indicates some of\nthe preoccupying concerns of his later writings. In general, it\ninvolves the expansion of the limited spatio-temporal forms and\nessentially causal-mechanistic categories of Kant\u2019s philosophy\nthrough the integration of, for example, religious, historical,\nartistic, linguistic and psychological experiences. Benjamin\u2019s\nenduring concern with the new, the outmoded and the heteronomous\nreflect this attempt to integrate more speculative phenomenological\npossibilities of experience into the remit of philosophical\nknowledge. It resists privileging any single discipline of knowledge,\npreserving a multiplicity that implicates truth in the problem of\naesthetic representation. This would lead Benjamin to attempt a radical\nrethinking of the philosophical concept of the Idea, away from its\ndualistic associations with a timeless and purely rational essence of\nthings.\nBenjamin also believes that a more speculative metaphysics would\nnecessitate the abolishment of the sharp distinction between Nature\nand Freedom\u2014or causal mechanism and moral willing\u2014in\nKant\u2019s architectonic. Since it is a specific understanding of\n\u201cdialectic\u201d which mediates between these two spheres in\nKant\u2019s critical system, this entails a speculative rethinking of the\nKantian dialectic. This suggests that new possibilities of syllogistic\nlogical relations might themselves be opened up, including what he\ncalls \u201ca certain nonsynthesis of two concepts in another\u201d\n(SW 1, 106; cf. Weber 2008, 48). The relation of nonsynthesis hinted\nat here can be seen to inform Benjamin\u2019s understanding of the Idea as\na constellation of extremes in the Origin of the German\nMourning-Play and of the dialectical image in his mature\nwritings. In this sense, Benjamin\u2019s metacritique of Kant represents an\nattempt to construct an alternative post-Kantian tradition to that of\nHegelian dialectics. It therefore required a new philosophy of\nhistory.\n",
