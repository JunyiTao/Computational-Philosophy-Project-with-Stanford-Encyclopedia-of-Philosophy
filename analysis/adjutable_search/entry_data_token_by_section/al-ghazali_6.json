    "main_text": "Causality in al-Ghaz\u00e2l\u00ee || Occasionalism versus Secondary Causality\n7.1 Occasionalism versus Secondary Causality\n\nAl-Ash\u2019ari (873\u2013935), the founder of the theological\nschool that al-Ghaz\u00e2l\u00ee belonged to, had rejected the\nexistence of \u201cnatures\u201d (tab\u00e2\u2019i\u2019\n) and of causal connections among created beings. In a radical attempt\nto explain God\u2019s omnipotence, he combined several ideas that\nwere developed earlier in Muslim kal\u00e2m to what became\nknown as occasionalism. All material things are composed of atoms that\nhave no qualities or attributes but simply make up the shape of the\nbody. The atoms of the bodies are the carrier of\n\u201caccidents\u201d (singl. \u2018arad), which are\nattributes like weight, density, color, smell, etc. In the cosmology\nof al-Ash\u2019ar\u00ee all immaterial things are considered\n\u201caccidents\u201d that inhere in a \u201csubstance\u201d\n(jawhar). Only the atoms of spatially extended bodies can be\nsubstances. A person\u2019s thoughts, for instance, are considered\naccidents that inhere in the atoms of the person\u2019s brain, while\nhis or her faith is an accident inhering in the atoms of the heart.\nNone of the accidents, however, can subsist from one moment\n(waqt) to the next. This leads to a cosmology where in each\nmoment God assigns the accidents to bodies in which they inhere. When\none moment ends, God creates new accidents. None of the created\naccidents in the second moment has any causal relation to the ones in\nthe earlier moment. If a body continues to have a certain attribute\nfrom one moment to the next, then God creates two identical accidents\ninhering in that body in each of the two subsequent moments. Movement\nand development generate when God decides to change the arrangement of\nthe moment before. A ball is moved, for instance, when in the second\nmoment of two the atoms of the ball happen to be created in a certain\ndistance from the first. The distance determines the speed of the\nmovement. The ball thus jumps in leaps over the playing field and the\nsame is true for the players\u2019 limbs and their bodies. This also\napplies to the atoms of the air if there happen to be some wind. In\nevery moment, God re-arranges all the atoms of this world anew and He\ncreates new accidents\u2014thus creating a new world every moment\n(Perler/Rudolph 2000, 28\u201362).\n\nAll Ash\u2019arite theologians up to the generation of\nal-Ghaz\u00e2l\u00ee\u2014including his teacher\nal-Juwayn\u00ee\u2014subscribed to the occasionalist ontology\ndeveloped by al-Ash\u2019ar\u00ee. One of al-Juwayn\u00ee\u2019s\nlate works, the Creed for Niz\u00e2m al-Mulk\n(al-\u2018Aq\u00eeda al-Niz\u00e2miyya), shows, however,\nthat he already explored different ontological models, particularly\nwith regard to the effects of human actions (al-Juwayn\u00ee 1948,\n30\u201336; Gimaret 1980, 122\u201328). A purely occasionalist model\nfinds it difficult to explain how God can make humans responsible for\ntheir own actions if they do not cause them. As a viable alternative\nto the occasionalist ontology, al-Ghaz\u00e2l\u00ee considered the\nAvicennan model of secondary causes. When God wishes to create a\ncertain event He employs some of His own creations as mediators or\n\u201csecondary causes.\u201d God creates series of efficient causes\nwhere any superior element causes the existence of the inferior ones.\nAvicenna stresses that no causal series, in any of the four types of\ncauses, can regress indefinitely. Every series of causes and effects\nmust have at least three components: a first element, a middle\nelement, and a last element. In such a chain only the first element is\nthe cause in the real sense of the word (\u2018illa mutlaqa)\nof all subsequent elements. It causes the last element of that\nchain\u2014the ultimate effect\u2014through one or many\nintermediaries (singl. mutawassat), which are the middle\nelements of the chain. Looking at a chain of efficient causes, the\n\u201cfiniteness of the causes\u201d (tan\u00e2h\u00ee\nl-\u2019ilal) serves for Avicenna as the basis of a proof of\nGod\u2019s existence. Tracing back all efficient causes in the\nuniverse will lead to a first efficient cause, which is itself\nuncaused. When the First Cause is also shown to be incorporeal and\nnumerically one, one has achieved a proof of God\u2019s existence\n(Avicenna 2005, 257\u20139, 270\u20133; Davidson 1987,\n339\u201340).\n",
