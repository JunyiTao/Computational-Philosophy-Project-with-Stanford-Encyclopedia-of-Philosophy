    "main_text": "Temporal Boundaries\n2. Temporal Boundaries\n\nWhen writing the history of a segment of the past there is always a\ndegree of arbitrariness in demarcating its temporal boundary. Early\nmodern philosophy spans the early sixteenth century to the late\neighteenth century, but where to draw the precise boundaries will\nforever garner debate. In the history of economics, there is little\nquestion that Adam Smith constitutes the founding authority on the\nsubject. A few general treatises appeared before Adam Smith\u2019s,\nstarting with Antoine de Montchr\u00e9tien\u2019s\nTraict\u00e9 de l\u2019\u00e9conomie politique (1615),\nPierre de Boisguilbert, Dissertation de la nature des\nrichesses (1707) and culminating with Turgot\u2019s\nR\u00e9flexions sur la formation et la distribution des\nrichessess (1766), James Steuart\u2019s Principles of\nPolitical \u0152conomy (1767), and Condillac\u2019s Le\nCommerce et le gouvernement consid\u00e9r\u00e9s relativement\nl\u2019un \u00e0 l\u2019autre (1776). Nevertheless, Adam\nSmith\u2019s Wealth of Nations (1776) was the definitive\nwork of the period, although it took about two decades to reach that\nstature, and serve as the founding text for the classical school of\npolitical economy of the nineteenth century.\n\nAs Michel Foucault discerned in Les mots et les choses\n(The Order of Things, 1966 [1970]), there was a significant\ntransformation in economic discourse circa 1800, but not for the\nreasons he gave. It was not that the concept of wealth was merely\nrepresented before 1800, and then gained materiality. What\ndistinguishes early modern economics from the classical period that\ntook hold in the early nineteenth century was that the latter\norganized their analysis around \u201cthe economy\u201d. Prior to\nthat, the various core phenomena were either treated separately or, if\nbundled together, were for the most part treated as part of the\nnatural order (see Schabas 2005).\n\nIt is important to recognize that \u201cthe economy\u201d is a\ntheoretical construct, an emergent order that sits upon patterns of\nhuman activity directed at production, distribution, and consumption.\nAs a social kind, recognition of \u201cthe economy\u201d took hold\nwith Ricardo (1817) and John Stuart Mill (1848), among others (see\nTribe 1981). This shift in part reflected the great economic\ntransformation of the time, what has come to be known as the\nIndustrial Revolution. Smith and his predecessors were still under the\ngrip of a pre-industrial world, one of mercantile and agrarian\ncapitalism, with only fleeting acknowledgments of the industrial\ntake-off that had commenced by the 1760s.\n\nFinally, the adjective \u201cpolitical\u201d became paramount in the\nnineteenth century, but was seldom used in the early modern period.\nThe primary name for economics in the eighteenth century was the\n\u201cscience of commerce\u201d, as is evident in the titles of a\nnumber of leading texts at the time, for example by Forbonnais,\nCantillon, Tucker, and Condillac. Moreover, the primary focus was on\npublic debt, and appeals to significant political reforms were\nperipheral rather than central. As Hume observed in 1741, \u201ctrade\nwas never esteemed an affair of state till the last century\u201d\n(\u201cOf Civil Liberty\u201d, [1987: 88])\u2014Niccol\u00f2\nMachiavelli made no mention of trade; moreover, it might prove too\nchallenging to arrive at \u201cgeneral truths in politics\u201d\n(ibid. [1987: 87\u201388]). When Smith took up the \u201cscience of\npolitical economy\u201d in Book Four of the Wealth of\nNations, he limited it to the policies of the legislator and\npublic finance. Notwithstanding attention to the political\nrestrictions on trade and commerce, the leading economists of the\nlatter half of the eighteenth century, namely Hume, Quesnay, Turgot,\nand Smith, were inclined to downplay the influence of politics, and\nwere conservative when it came to property rights. It was an age\ndominated by Montesquieu in France, and Edmund Burke in Britain, and\nthe revolutions of 1776 and 1789 were bourgeois rather than socialist\n(see Pocock 1985; Sonenscher 2007).\n\nIn this respect as well, political economy of the nineteenth century\nwas significantly different in tenor; it put center-stage the plight\nof the poor, the expansion of suffrage to working men, and their\nentitlement to form trade unions. Socialist economic thought only\nemerged in the beginning of the nineteenth century, particularly in\nFrance. There were antecedents, such as the English Levellers Gerrard\nWinstanley and John Lilburne, and the Dutch reformers Johan De Witt\nand Pieter de la Court, but they were not important contributors to\neconomic discourse. To a significant degree, Smith served as the\ninflection point, with his famous statement that \u201cno society can\nsurely be flourishing and happy, of which the far greater part of the\nmembers are poor and miserable\u201d, or that merchants \u201chave\nan interest to deceive and even to oppress the public\u201d (Smith\n1776 [1976: 96, 267]). British and French economic thought, with some\nexceptions, leaned primarily toward socialism throughout the\nnineteenth century. Ricardo exposed the parasitical standing of the\nlandowning class, and spawned a radical following that included both\nJames and John Stuart Mill, as well as a group known as the Ricardian\nsocialists. In fact, many of the early neoclassical economists, for\nexample William Stanley Jevons, Alfred Marshall, and L\u00e9on\nWalras, were democratic socialists of one stripe or another. It is not\na challenge to plaster a very different and far more conservative\ntenor to mainstream economics of the twentieth century, whether one\nlooks to Vilfredo Pareto, Irving Fisher, Schumpeter, Hayek or\nFriedman. Attending to the political hue of economic discourse serves\nall the more to distinguish the early modern period from the classical\nschool of political economy of the nineteenth century or the\nneoclassical school that persists to the present.\n\nWhile there is no single definition of economics, most of the\ndiscourse of the early modern period centered upon a set of phenomena\nsuch as prices, trade, taxes, money and banking. In the nineteenth\ncentury, most texts foregrounded the laws that govern production and\ndistribution and, starting in the 1870s, exchange and consumption. In\nthe twentieth century, the best known definition is the one offered by\nLionel Robbins in 1932:\n\n\nEconomics is the science which studies human behaviour as a\nrelationship between ends and scarce means which have alternative\nuses. (Robbins 1932: 15)\n\n\nConsumers maximize utility (preferences) and firms maximize profits\n(expected returns), and this seeps into virtually every facet of life.\nGiven some limiting assumptions, modern welfare theory can prove that\nan economy in general equilibrium attains Pareto optimality, that it\nis the most efficient and the most just.\n",
