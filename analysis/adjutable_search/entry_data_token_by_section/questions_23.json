    "main_text": "Embedded (or indirect) questions || Responsive, rogative, and anti-rogative predicates\n4.9 Pointers to further reading\n\nA detailed uniform treatment of declarative and interrogative\ncomplements of responsive predicates in the context of inquisitive\nsemantics can be found in Theiler et al. 2018. On this\ntheory, declarative and interrogative complements are of the same\nsemantic type, which allows each responsive verb to have a single\nlexical entry.\n\nFor a detailed critique of the recent literature on knowledge-wh, see\nChapter 2 of Stanley 2011. Parent (2014) provides a survey of the\nrecent literature about knowledge-wh organized around three issues:\nthe reducibility of knowledge-wh to knowledge-that, the relativity of\nknowledge-wh to a contrast proposition, and the issue of whether the\ncontext-sensitivity of knowing-wh is to be understood as a semantic or\na pragmatic phenomenon. Uegaki (2019) provides an overview of recent\nwork on the semantics of responsive predicates generally and is\norganized around four approaches: the reduction of questions to\npropositions, the reduction of propositions to questions, the\nuniformity approach (on which declarative and interrogative\ncomplements of a responsive predicate are of the same semantic type),\nand the ambiguity approach (which postulates distinct\nproposition-taking and question-taking readings of a given responsive\npredicate). \n",
