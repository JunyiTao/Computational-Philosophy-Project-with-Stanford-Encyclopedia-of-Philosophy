    "main_text": "Pleasure, Motivation, and the Brain || Motivation-Based Analyses and Their Problems\n3.1 Motivation-Based Analyses and Their Problems\n\nPleasure has traditionally been connected with motivation, although\ntraditions differ on how. Plato (Charmides 167e1\u20133),\nAristotle (Rhetoric I, 11:1370a16\u201318; DA II,\n3:414b2\u20136 and II, 9:4332b3\u20137; EE II,\n7:1223a34\u201335), and the common sense for which they speak are\npluralist about human motivation. For all these, while one\nsalient kind of motive involves longing for pleasure or pleasant\nthings, people also have other ultimate goals. They compete\nfor honors and other purely competitive goods, seek revenge, and\npursue and avoid other things as well. And sometimes they do so\nbecause of evaluative judgments based in ultimately nonhedonic\ngrounds. Hedonists argued that spontaneous pleasure-seeking is\nevidence of pleasure\u2019s unique status as our ultimate goal and\ngood, as evidenced by the unenculturated and therefore uncorrupted\nappetites and values of infants. The ancient Stoics interpreted these\nphenomena so as to block this hedonist appeal to nature\u2019s\nauthority: pleasure is rather a by-product of the achievement of\nother ends, starting right from the infant\u2019s innate\nimpulses, not toward pleasure, but rather toward biological goods such\nas food, guided by a natural instinct directed toward its\npreservation, which rational motivation may later supersede (Long and\nSedley, 1987, 65A3\u20134; Brunschwig 1986). Augustine influentially\nbuilt on the Stoics in attributing pleasure to the will (CD\nXIV,6); later Western Christian thought mainly followed him.\n\nModern Western philosophers, following Aristotle\u2019s account of\nthe unity of motivation (DA 433a30\u2013b13) and\nAugustine\u2019s counting all motives as loves of the will (but often\nignoring the pluralism about kinds of motive on which they and their\ntraditions equally insisted), have often treated \u2018desire\u2019\nas including all motivation and as of a single kind to be explained on\nthe same pattern. Between 1600 and 1900 they often regarded desire as\nuniformly directed toward one\u2019s own pleasure, along lines\nsuggested by the simple picture. Joseph Butler (1726) responded to\nthis view of human nature as hedonistically selfish by renewing the\nStoic insistence on the priority of motivation to pleasure and also\nthe related medieval view that pleasure always consists in the\nsatisfaction of some appetite. He thereby could argue that\npleasure-seeking without prior motivation would be impossible since\npleasure always consists in the satisfaction of some motive (in his\nlanguage, \u2018passion\u2019) and that altruistic motives are thus\nin principle as capable of leading to a high level of fulfilled\ndesire, and thus of pleasure, as any others. \n\nThere are, however, prima facie counterexamples to taking\ndesire satisfaction to be a necessary condition for pleasure, as Plato\nlong ago pointed out (Philebus 51A\u201352C): we often enjoy\nthings such as sights, sounds, and fragrances that may surprise us\nwithout our having wanted them before, clinging to them when they are\nwith us, or craving them after they are gone. But Butler presumably\nfollowed Plato and his medieval successors in implicitly understanding\nunconscious internally represented needs as of a kind with desires.\nTimothy Schroeder does similarly today (2001, 2004), but in an account\non which pleasure does not require the actual existence of desires or\ntheir satisfaction, but is rather a defeasible sensing of an increase\nin their net satisfaction. However, the basis for such an\ninformational interpretation in the neuroscience appealed to seems\nvery slim (Katz 2005c). Older desire satisfaction accounts of pleasure\nwere susceptible to counterexamples based in desires that expire\nbefore their satisfaction (Brandt 1982). Recent writers avoid these by\nproposing instead the satisfaction of current desires, such as\naffective desire for the continuation of one\u2019s present\nexperiences (Madell 2002, pp.\u00a097\u201398). Other contemporary\nwriters on pleasure, with analytic reductionist projects in folk\npsychology (Davis, 1981a, 1981b, 1982) and metaethics (Heathwood 2006,\n2007), have claimed that pleasure is definable as believed\nsatisfaction of current desire. However, we often don\u2019t enjoy things\nthat we continue to desire, at least for a time. And addiction offers\nsalient cases of such cravings that hang around for a very long time\nwithout leading to pleasure when indulged. And distinguishing\nbelieving or sensing that we are now getting what we want from now\nactually getting it doesn\u2019t generally solve this class of\nproblem. So it appears that it won\u2019t do to make either desire or\nits satisfaction or sensings or beliefs in that satisfaction\nsufficient for pleasure, let alone identical to it, as these\nphilosophers have variously proposed. \n\nOne cannot help suspecting that the attraction of such desire\nsatisfaction related views of pleasure owes something to unconscious\nequivocation between someone\u2019s feeling satisfied and\ndesires\u2019 being satisfied (i.e., fulfilled) merely by\ntheir satisfaction conditions coming to pass, as they might long after\nthe desirer is dead and gone. (This latter use is analogous to the way\nlogicians speak of satisfaction, without any felt contentment or\nhappiness of the linguistic objects considered being in question.) One\nmay view someone\u2019s success in a way that makes\nmere project fulfillment count toward it, but it is hard to\nsee why anything like that, or sensing (Schroeder 2001, 2004) or\nbelieving (Davis and Heathwood) it, should figure directly in an\naccount of someone\u2019s pleasure even while alive. To\nadapt the example of Plato\u2019s Socrates that scandalized his\nCallicles (Gorgias 494A\u2013495A) to apply to Madell, one\nmay intensely and affectively desire to continue one\u2019s\nexperience of scratching one\u2019s itch or rubbing oneself, which\ndesire is simultaneously fulfilled, without oneself experiencing\npleasure in so doing. Fulfilling compulsive or addictive cravings in\ntheir time need not be pleasant. And appropriately limiting\nthe kind of desires, to avoid all such counterexamples, would seem to\nrequire building a relation to pleasure or the like into the desires,\nthus giving up the reductive project. Consonantly with the foregoing,\ndecades of social psychological research using self-ratings of\nhappiness (e.g., Strack, Argyle, and Schwarz 1991) indicates a hedonic\ncomponent (or two, one for positive and one for negative affect)\nunderlying such self-reports that tracks how good people feel but that\nis independent of the component tracking their beliefs about their\nachievement of desired or valued goals. People care about both, but\nfor different reasons.\n\nProblems also face analyzing pleasure in motivational terms other than\n\u201cdesire\u201d more closely tied to behavior. Henry Sidgwick\nrejected simple relational accounts of pleasure as \u201ca feeling we\nseek to bring into consciousness and retain there\u201d or the\n\u201cmotive power\u201d toward this as incapable of giving the\ncorrect \u2018quantitative\u2019 answers about degree of pleasure\ndemanded of any serious definition. He argued that, while\n\u201cpleasures of repose, a warm bath, etc.\u201d might be handled\nby moving to an account in terms of motivational dispositions,\nexcitement often adds motivation disproportionate to \npleasure\u00a0\u2013 an\nobjection that applies to similar behavioral and motivational accounts\ncurrent\n today.[28]\n\n",
