The Principle Theories\u2014Constructive Theories Distinction\n\nThere is much that is original in Einstein\u2019s philosophy of science as\ndescribed thus far. At the very least, he rearranged the bits and\npieces of doctrine that he learned from others\u2014Kant, Mach,\nDuhem, Poincar\u00e9, Schlick, and others\u2014in a strikingly\nnovel way. But Einstein\u2019s most original contribution to\ntwentieth-century philosophy of science lies elsewhere, in his\ndistinction between what he termed \u201cprinciple theories\u201d\nand \u201cconstructive theories.\u201d\n\nThis idea first found its way into print in a brief 1919 article in\nthe Times of London (Einstein 1919). A constructive theory,\nas the name implies, provides a constructive model for the phenomena\nof interest. An example would be kinetic theory. A principle theory\nconsists of a set of individually well-confirmed, high-level empirical\ngeneralizations, \u201cwhich permit of precise formulation\u201d\n(Einstein 1914, 749). Examples include the first and second laws of\nthermodynamics. Ultimate understanding requires a constructive theory,\nbut often, says Einstein, progress in theory is impeded by premature\nattempts at developing constructive theories in the absence of\nsufficient constraints by means of which to narrow the range of\npossible constructive theories. It is the function of principle\ntheories to provide such constraint, and progress is often best\nachieved by focusing first on the establishment of such principles.\nAccording to Einstein, that is how he achieved his breakthrough with\nthe theory of relativity, which, he says, is a principle theory, its\ntwo principles being the relativity principle and the light\nprinciple.\n\nWhile the principle theories-constructive theories distinction first\nmade its way into print in 1919, there is considerable evidence that\nit played an explicit role in Einstein\u2019s thinking much earlier\n(Einstein 1907, Einstein to Sommerfeld 14 January 1908, CPAE, vol. 5,\nDoc. 73, Einstein 1914). Nor was it only the relativity and light\nprinciples that served Einstein as constraints in his theorizing.\nThus, he explicitly mentions also the Boltzmann principle, \\(S = k\n\\log W\\), as another such:\n\nThis equation connects thermodynamics with the molecular theory. It\nyields, as well, the statistical probabilities of the states of\nsystems for which we are not in a position to construct a\nmolecular-theoretical model. To that extent, Boltzmann\u2019s magnificent\nidea is of significance for theoretical physics \u2026 because it\nprovides a heuristic principle whose range extends beyond the domain\nof validity of molecular mechanics. (Einstein 1915, p. 262).\n\n\nEinstein is here alluding the famous entropic analogy whereby, in his\n1905 photon hypothesis paper, he reasoned from the fact that black\nbody radiation in the Wien regime satisfied the Boltzmann principle to\nthe conclusion that, in that regime, radiation behaved as if it\nconsisted of mutually independent, corpuscle-like quanta of\nelectromagnetic energy. The quantum hypothesis is a constructive model\nof radiation; the Boltzmann principle is the constraint that first\nsuggested that model.\n\nThere are anticipations of the principle theories-constructive\ntheories distinction in the nineteenth-century electrodynamics\nliterature, James Clerk Maxwell, in particular, being a source from\nwhich Einstein might well have drawn (see Harman 1998). At the turn of\nthe century, the \u201cphysics of principles\u201d was a subject\nunder wide discussion. At the turn of 1900, Hendrik A. Lorentz\n(Lorentz 1900, 1905; see Frisch 2005) and Henri Poincar\u00e9 (for\nexample, Poincar\u00e9 1904; see, Giedymin 1982, Darrigol 1995)\npresented the opposition between the \u201cphysics of\nprinciples\u201c and the \u201cphysics of models\u201c as\ncommonplace. In a similar vein, Arnold Sommerfeld opposed a\n\u201cphysics of problems\u201c, a style of doing physics based on\nconcrete puzzle solving, to the \u201cpractice of principles\u201c\ndefended by Max Planck (Seth 2010). Philipp Frank (1908, relying on\nRey 1909) defined relativity theory as a \u201c conceptual\ntheory\u201c based on abstract, but empirically well confirmed\nprinciples rather than on intuitive models. Probably many other\nexamples could be find. . But however extensive his borrowings (no\nexplicit debt was ever acknowledged), in Einstein\u2019s hands the\ndistinction becomes a methodological tool of impressive scope and\nfertility. What is puzzling, and even a bit sad, is that this most\noriginal methodological insight of Einstein\u2019s had comparatively little\nimpact on later philosophy of science or practice in physics. Only in\nrecent decades, Einstein constructive-principle distinction has\nattracted interest in the philosophical literature, originating a\nstill living philosophical debate on the foundation of spacetime\ntheories (Brown 2005, Janssen 2009, Lange\n 2014).[4]\n",
