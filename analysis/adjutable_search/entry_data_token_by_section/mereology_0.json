    "main_text": "\u2018Part\u2019 and Parthood\n1. \u2018Part\u2019 and Parthood\n\nA preliminary caveat is in order. It concerns the very notion of\n\u2018part\u2019 that mereology is about, which does not have an\nexact counterpart in ordinary language. Broadly speaking, in English\nwe can use \u2018part\u2019 to indicate any portion of a given\nentity. The portion may itself be attached to the remainder, as in\n(1), or detached, as in (2); it may be cognitively or functionally\nsalient, as in (1)\u2013(2), or arbitrarily demarcated, as in (3);\nself-connected, as in (1)\u2013(3), or disconnected, as in (4);\nhomogeneous or otherwise well-matched, as in (1)\u2013(4), or\ngerrymandered, as in (5); material, as in (1)\u2013(5), or\nimmaterial, as in (6); extended, as in (1)\u2013(6), or unextended,\nas in (7); spatial, as in (1)\u2013(7), or temporal, as in (8); and\nso on.\n\n\n(1)\nThe handle is part of the mug. \n\n(2)\nThe remote control is part of the stereo system. \n\n(3)\nThe left half is your part of the cake. \n\n(4)\nThe cutlery is part of the tableware. \n\n(5)\nThe contents of this bag is only part of what I bought.\n\n\n(6)\nThat area is part of the living room. \n\n(7)\nThe outermost points are part of the perimeter. \n\n(8)\nThe first act was the best part of the play. \n\n\nAll of these uses illustrate the general notion of \u2018part\u2019\nthat forms the focus of mereology, regardless of any internal\ndistinctions. (For more examples and tentative taxonomies, see Winston\net al. 1987, Iris et al. 1988, Gerstl and Pribbenow\n1995, Pribbenow 2002, Westerhoff 2004, and Simons 2013.) Sometimes,\nhowever, the English word is used in a more restricted sense. For\ninstance, it can be used to designate only the cognitively salient\nrelation of parthood illustrated in (1), the relevant notion of\nsalience being determined by Gestalt factors (Rescher and Oppenheim\n1955; Bower and Glass 1976; Palmer 1977) or other perceptual and\ncognitive factors at large (Tversky 2005). Or it may designate only\nthe functional relation reflected in the parts list included in the\nuser's manual of a machine, or of a ready-to-assemble product, as in\n(2), in which case the parts of an object x are just its\n\u201ccomponents\u201d, i.e., those parts that are available as\nindividual units regardless of their actual interaction with the other\nparts of x. (A component is a part of an object,\nrather than just part of it; see e.g. Tversky 1989, Simons\nand Dement 1996.) Clearly, the properties of such restricted relations\nmay not coincide with those of parthood understood more broadly, and\nit will be apparent that pure mereology is only concerned with the\nlatter. \n\nOn the other hand, the English word \u2018part\u2019 is sometimes\nused in a broader sense, too, for instance to designate the relation\nof material constitution, as in (9), or the relation of mixture\ncomposition, as in (10), or the relation of group membership, as in\n(11):\n\n\n(9)\nThe clay is part of the statue. \n\n(10)\nGin is part of martini. \n\n(11)\nThe goalie is part of the team. \n\n\nThe mereological status of these relations, however, is controversial.\nFor instance, although the constitution relation exemplified in (9)\nwas included by Aristotle in his threefold taxonomy of parthood\n(Metaphysics, \u0394, 1023b), many contemporary authors\nwould rather construe it as a sui generis, non-mereological\nrelation (see e.g. Wiggins 1980, Rea 1995, Baker 1997, Evnine 2011) or\nelse as the relation of identity (Noonan 1993, Pickel 2010), possibly\ncontingent or occasional identity (Gibbard 1975, Robinson 1982,\nGallois 1998). Similarly, the ingredient-mixture relationship\nexemplified in (10) is of dubious mereological status, as the\ningredients may undergo significant chemical transformations that\nalter the structural characteristics they have in isolation (Sharvy\n1983, Bogen 1995, Fine 1995a, Needham 2007). As for cases such as\n(11), there is disagreement concerning whether teams and other groups\nshould be regarded as genuine mereological wholes, and while there are\nphilosophers who do think so (from Oppenheim and Putnam 1958 to\nQuinton 1976, Copp 1984, Martin 1988, and Sheehy 2006), many are\ninclined to regard groups as entities of a different sort and to\nconstrue the relation of group membership as distinct from parthood\n(see e.g. Simons 1980, Ruben 1983, Gilbert 1989, Meixner 1997,\nUzquiano 2004, Effingham 2010b, and Ritchie 2013 for different\nproposals). For all these reasons, here we shall take mereology to be\nconcerned mainly with the principles governing the relation\nexemplified in (1)\u2013(8), leaving it open whether one or more such\nbroader uses of \u2018part\u2019 may themselves be subjected to\nmereological treatments of some sort. \n\nFinally, it is worth stressing that mereology assumes no ontological\nrestriction on the field of \u2018part\u2019. In principle, the\nrelata can be as different as material bodies, events, geometric\nentities, or spatio-temporal regions, as in (1)\u2013(8), as well as\nabstract entities such as properties, propositions, types, or kinds,\nas in the following examples:\n\n\n(12)\nRationality is part of personhood. \n\n(13)\nThe antecedent is the \u2018if\u2019 part of the\nconditional. \n\n(14)\nThe letter \u2018m\u2019 is part of the word\n\u2018mereology\u2019. \n\n(15)\nCarbon is part of methane. \n\n\nThis is not uncontentious. For instance, to some philosophers the\nthought that such abstract entities may be structured mereologically\ncannot be reconciled with their being universals. To adapt an example\nfrom Lewis (1986a), if the letter-type \u2018m\u2019 is part of the\nword-type \u2018mereology\u2019, then so is the letter-type\n\u2018e\u2019. But there are two occurrences of \u2018e\u2019 in\n\u2018mereology\u2019. Shall we say that the letter is part of the\nword twice over? Likewise, if carbon is part of\nmethane, then so is hydrogen. But each methane\nmolecule consists of one carbon atom and four hydrogen atoms. Shall we\nsay that hydrogen is part of methane four times\nover? What could that possibly mean? How can one thing be part of\nanother more than once? These are pressing questions, and the friend\nof structured universals may want to respond by conceding that the\nrelevant building relation is not parthood but, rather, a\nnon-mereological mode of composition (Armstrong 1986, 1988). However,\nother options are open, including some that take the difficulty at\nface value from a mereological standpoint (see e.g. Bigelow and\nPargetter 1989, Hawley 2010, Mormann 2010, Bader 2013, and Forrest\n2013, forthcoming; see also D. Smith 2009: \u00a74, K. Bennett 2013,\nFisher 2013, and Cotnoir 2013b: \u00a74, 2015 for explicit discussion\nof the idea of being part-related \u201cmany times over\u201d).\nWhether such options are viable may be controversial. Yet their\navailability bears witness to the full generality of the notion of\nparthood that mereology seeks to characterize. In this sense, the\npoint to be stressed is metaphilosophical. For while Le\u015bniewski's\nand Leonard and Goodman's original formulations betray a nominalistic\nstand, reflecting a conception of mereology as an ontologically\nparsimonious alternative to set theory, there is no necessary link\nbetween the analysis of parthood relations and the philosophical\nposition of\n nominalism.[5]\n As a formal theory (in Husserl's sense of \u2018formal\u2019, i.e.,\nas opposed to \u2018material\u2019) mereology is simply an attempt\nto lay down the general principles underlying the relationships\nbetween an entity and its constituent parts, whatever the nature of\nthe entity, just as set theory is an attempt to lay down the\nprinciples underlying the relationships between a set and its members.\nUnlike set theory, mereology is not committed to the existence of\nabstracta: the whole can be as concrete as the parts. But\nmereology carries no nominalistic commitment to concreta\neither: the parts can be as abstract as the whole.\n\nWhether this way of conceiving of mereology as a general and\ntopic-neutral theory holds water is a question that will not be\nfurther addressed here. It will, however, be in the background of much\nthat follows. Likewise, little will be said about the important\nquestion of whether one should countenance different (primitive)\npart-whole relations to hold among different kinds of entity (as urged\ne.g. by Sharvy 1980, McDaniel 2004, 2009, and Mellor 2006), or perhaps\neven among entities of the same kind (Fine 1994, 2010). Such a\nquestion will nonetheless be relevant to the assessment of certain\nmereological principles discussed below, whose generality may be\nclaimed to hold only in a restricted sense, or on a limited\nunderstanding of \u2018part\u2019. For further issues concerning the\nalleged universality and topic-neutrality of mereology, see also\nJohnston (2005, 2006), Varzi (2010), Donnelly (2011), Hovda (2014),\nand Johansson (2015). (Some may even think that there are no parthood\nrelations whatsoever, e.g., because there are there are no causally\ninert non-logical properties or relations, and parthood would be one\nsuch; for a defense of this sort of mereological anti-realism, see\nCowling 2014.)\n",
