Since the political (and legal) arrangements in a society are very powerful in solidifying such associations through various institutions and practices, \u201cPolitical Education\u201d is \u201cthe key-stone of the arch\u201d (Mill 1992, 193). Not only is government responsible for fostering proper habits and associations with good laws, justice and the eradication of corruption, according to Mill; but also, government should be held accountable when it failed to do so.\nGiven that \u201cour opinions are the fathers of our actions,\u201d Mill argued amidst the debate on parliamentary representation, it is vital that individuals do not take the opinions of others upon trust or let others choose for them what is in their interest to pursue. It was thus quite an important educational task to foster habits of examining the evidence which grounds opinions (Mill 1826, 10\u201311, 13\u201314; Mill 1992, 122, 126\u2013130). Inattention to evidence made the detection of fallacious thinking, lying underneath a host of prejudices, impossible. Especially since those \u201cwho stand on the vantage ground of power,\u201d Mill warned, had made an art of defending power through, what he called, \u201cthe logic of power\u201d: the misrepresentation of facts, suppression of evidence, begging the question, argument from authority, appealing to fear, and inter alia, ridicule (Mill 1824, 465). Due to the ever-present danger that political, legal and social institutions might foster \u201chabits of servility and toleration of arbitrary power,\u201d the \u201cLiberty of the Press\u201d is a vital counteracting social influence, and, for that reason, \u201can inestimable blessing\u201d to good government (Mill 1813b, 211\u2013212, Mill 1992, 117\u2013123; Grint 2017). The press functions thus as a sort of \u201chigh and constant observer\u201d of government acts (Mill 1992, 107) through apt diffusion of praise and blame to public functionaries.\n",
