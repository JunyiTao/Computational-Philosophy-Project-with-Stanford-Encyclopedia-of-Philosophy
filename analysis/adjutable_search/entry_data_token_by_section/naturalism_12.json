    "main_text": "Methodological Naturalism || A Role for Intuitions\n2.5 Mathematical, Modal and Moral Knowledge\nMethodological naturalism fits more naturally with some areas of\nphilosophy than others. It is perhaps not hard to understand, at least\nin outline, how work in areas like metaphysics, philosophy of mind,\nmeta-ethics and epistemology might be aimed at the construction of\nsynthetic theories supported by a posteriori evidence. But in\nother philosophical areas the methodologically naturalistic project\nmay seem less obviously applicable. In particular it might be unclear\nhow it applies to those areas of philosophy that make claims about\nmathematics, first-order morality or modality.\nOne possibility would be for methodological naturalists to make\nexceptions for these areas of philosophy. It would still be a\nsignificant thesis if methodological naturalism could be shown to\napply to a number of central areas of philosophy, even if some specialist\nareas call for a different methodology.\nThis final subsection will address two issues raised by this suggestion. The first relates specifically to the idea that modal claims constitute a specialism within philosophy. Perhaps mathematical investigation and even first-order moralizing can be regarded as specialist subfields within philosophy. But it is arguable that a concern with the modal realm runs through all of philosophy. If so, then a challenge to the naturalist status of modal claims will threaten the naturalist status of all philosophy.\nThe second issue will be more directly about the methodologically naturalist status of the three areas mentioned\u2014including mathematics and morality, along with modality. How far do methodological naturalists need to allow that mathematics, morality and modality constitute exceptions to their position in the first place?\n\nOn the first issue, Bertrand Russell said\n [A philosophical proposition] must not deal\nspecially with things on the surface of the earth, or with the solar\nsystem, or with any other portion of space and time. \u2026 A\nphilosophical proposition must be applicable to everything that exists\nor may exist. (1917: 110)\n However, one can agree with Russell that\nphilosophy automatically has implications for the modal realm\n(\u201ceverything that \u2026 may exist\u201d), without accepting\nthat the aim of philosophy is to explore the modal realm as such. We\nneed to distinguish here between an interest in claims which, as it\nhappens, have modal implications, on the one hand, and an interest in\nthose modal implications themselves, on the other.  It is\nuncontentious that most of the claims of interest to philosopher have\nmodal implications. But it does not follow from this that most of\nphilosophy is interested in the modal realm itself.\nPhilosophy is largely concerned with claims about identity and\nconstitution, claims which as it happens will be necessary if they are\ntrue. When philosophers ask about knowledge, names, persons,\npersisting objects, free will, causation, and so on, they are seeking\nto understand the identity or constitution of these kinds. They want\nto know whether knowledge is the same as true justified belief,\nwhether persisting objects are composed of temporal parts, and so\non. And so any truths they might establish about such matters will\ninevitably be necessary rather than contingent, and so carry\nimplications about a realm beyond the actual.\nBut the fact that p implies necessarily p does\nnot mean that anyone who is interested in the former must be\ninterested in the latter, any more than someone who is interested in\nJohn\u2019s age being 47 must be interested in its being a prime\nnumber.\nThis makes room for methodological naturalists to insist that most\nprimary philosophical concerns are synthetic and a\nposteriori, even if they imply additional modal claims which are\nnot. Natural science provides a good analogy here. Water is\nH2O. Heat is molecular motion. Stars are made of hot\ngas. Halley\u2019s comet is made of rock and ice. Since all these\nclaims concern matters of identity and constitution, they too are\nnecessary if true. But science is interested in these synthetic a\nposteriori claims as such, rather than their modal\nimplications. Chemistry is interested in the composition of actual\nwater, and not with what happens in other possible\nworlds. Methodological naturalists can take the same line with\nphilosophical claims. Their focus is on whether knowledge is actually\nthe same as true justified belief, or whether persisting objects are\nactually composed of temporal parts\u2014issues which they take to be\nsynthetic and a posteriori\u2014and not with whether these\ntruths are necessary\u2014issues which may well have a different\nstatus.\nLet us now turn to the second issue flagged above. How far do\nmethodological naturalists in fact need to allow that\nmodality\u2014and mathematics and first-order morality\u2014do have\na different status from the synthetic a posteriori character\nthey attribute to philosophy in general?\nThe issues here are by no means clear-cut. In\nsections 1.7 and 1.8 above\nwe saw how the arguments for ontological naturalism placed general\nconstraints on the epistemological options in these area. By and large, these constraints tend to favour naturalism about philosophical method. There is no\nquestion of exploring these epistemological issues fully here, but\nsome brief comments will be in order.\nFor mathematics and modality, the epistemological possibilities\nwere restricted to irrealism and ontologically non-naturalist\nrealism. In the moral case, there were again irrealist options, and\nalso ontologically naturalist realisms that identified moral facts\nwith causally significant spatiotemporal facts.\nFor those who endorse irrealist options in any of these areas,\nthere would seem to be no tension with methodological\nnaturalism. After all, irrealist analyses deny that there is any\nsubstantial knowledge to be had in mathematics, modality or morality,\nand so will not think of object-level claims in these areas as\nthemselves contributing to philosophy. (This is consistent with\nthinking that a meta-understanding of the workings of mathematical,\nmodal or moral discourse is important to philosophy; but then there\nseems no reason why such a meta-understanding should be problematic\nfor methodological naturalism.)\nSimilarly, there seems no reason why the naturalist realist options\nin the moral case should be in tension with methodological naturalism.\nThe details deserve to be worked through, but on the face of things we\nmight expect knowledge of causally significant spatiotemporal moral\nfacts to be synthetic and a posteriori.\nThis leaves us with non-naturalist realist accounts of mathematical\nand modal knowledge. As we saw earlier, the best options here appeal\nto the neo-Fregean programme of grounding knowledge of the\nmathematical and modal realms in a priori analytic\nprinciples. If this programme could be vindicated, then it would\nindeed violate the requirements of methodological naturalism. But, as\nobserved earlier, it seems at best an open question whether analytic\nprinciples have the power to take us to realist knowledge of the\nmathematical and modal realms.\n",
