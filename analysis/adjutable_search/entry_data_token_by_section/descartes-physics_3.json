The Strategy of Cartesian Physics\n\nLike many of his contemporaries (e.g., Galileo and Gassendi),\nDescartes devised his mechanical theory in large part to refute the\nwidely held Aristotelian-based Scholastic explanation of natural\nphenomena that employed an ontology of \u201csubstantial forms\u201d\nand \u201cprimary matter\u201d. Briefly, Scholastic natural\nphilosophy viewed a material body as comprising both an inert\nproperty-less substratum (primary matter) and a quality-bearing\nessence (substantial form), with the latter providing the body\u2019s\ncausal capacities. A quantity of matter, for example, possesses\nweight, color, texture, and all of the other bodily properties, only\nin virtue of being conjoined with a determinate form (of a billiard\nball, chair, etc.). Descartes admits that he had earlier held such a\nview of gravity, envisioning the substantial form as a kind of\ngoal-directed (teleological) mental property of bodies: \u201cwhat\nmakes it especially clear that my idea of gravity was taken largely\nfrom the idea I had of the mind is the fact that I thought that\ngravity carried bodies towards the centre of the earth as if it had\nsome knowledge of the centre within itself. For this surely could not\nhappen without knowledge, and there can be any knowledge except in a\nmind\u201d (AT VII 442). In a revealing passage from The\nWorld, Descartes declares the Scholastic hypothesis to be both an\nunintelligible and inadequate methodological approach to explaining\nnatural phenomena:\n\nIf you find it strange that I make no use of the qualities one calls\nheat, cold, moistness, and dryness\u2026, as the philosophers [of\nthe schools] do, I tell you that these qualities appear to me to be in\nneed of explanation, and if I am not mistaken, not only these four\nqualities, but also all the others, and even all of the forms of\ninanimate bodies can be explained without having to assume anything\nelse for this in their matter but motion, size, shape, and the\narrangement of their parts (AT XI 25\u201326).\n\n\nDescartes\u2019 plan is to reduce the class of metaphysically suspect\nproperties, such as heat, weight, taste, to the empirically\nquantifiable attributes of size, shape, and motion. In other words,\nDescartes intends to replace the \u201cmentally\u201d influenced\ndepiction of physical qualities in Scholastic natural philosophy with\na theory that requires only the properties of extension to describe\nthe manifest order of the natural world. Consequently, Descartes was\nan early exponent of what came to be known as the\n\u201cprimary/secondary\u201d property distinction, a concept that\nwas very much \u201cin the air\u201d among the critics of\nScholasticism.\n\nNevertheless, even if Descartes\u2019 mechanistic natural philosophy\nshunned the metaphysics of substantial forms, his underlying\nmethodology or approach to science remained very close to the\nScholastic tradition. By the time of the composition of the\nPrinciples, Descartes had formulated a method that, like the\nScholastics, strived to explain natural phenomena based on the\nallegedly simple and irrefutable \u201cfacts\u201d and/or\nobservations, drawn from rational reflection on concepts or from\neveryday experience, about the most fundamental aspects of reality.\nThese supposedly basic facts thereby provide the requisite\nmetaphysical foundation for his physical hypotheses: in other words,\none proceeds from our \u201cclear and distinct\u201d knowledge of\ngeneral metaphysical items, such as the nature of material substance\nand its modes, to derive particular conclusions on specific types of\nphysical processes, for instance the laws of nature. This method of\nconducting science is quite contrary to the modern approach, needless\nto say, since modern scientists do not first engage in a metaphysical\nsearch for first principles on which to base their work. Yet, this is\nexactly the criticism that Descartes leveled at Galileo\u2019s\nphysics (in a letter to Mersenne from 1638): \u201cwithout having\nconsidered the first causes of nature, [Galileo] has merely looked for\nthe explanations of a few particular effects, and he has thereby built\nwithout foundations\u201d (AT II 380; see, also, the Preface to the\nFrench translation of the Principles, AT IXB 5\u201311). The\nstructure of the Principles, Descartes\u2019 most\ncomprehensive scientific work, reflects these priorities: Part I\nrecapitulates the arguments (well-known from the Meditations)\nfor the existence of God, mental substance, and other metaphysical\ntopics; whereas the remaining Parts proceed to explain the nature of\nmaterial substance, physics, cosmology, geology, and other branches of\nscience, supposedly based on these fundamental metaphysical truths.\nThis preoccupation with metaphysical foundations, and the causal\nexplanations of natural phenomena derived from them, might also\naccount for the absence in the Principles of Descartes\u2019\nmore mathematical work in physics, such as his discovery of the law of\nlight refraction. As he argued in the Rules for the Direction of\nthe Mind (1628), pure mathematicians are only concerned with\nfinding ratios and proportions, whereas natural philosophers are\nintent on understanding nature (AT X 393\u2013395). The development\nof modern physics, which is inextricably intertwined with modern\nmathematics, thus stands in sharp contrast to the latent Scholasticism\nevident in Descartes\u2019 metaphysical approach to physics.\n",
