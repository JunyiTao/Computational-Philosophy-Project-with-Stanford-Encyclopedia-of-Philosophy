    "main_text": "Arguments for Fictionalism || The paradox of existence\n3.3 The paradox of existence\n\nHere is a kind of puzzle or paradox that several philosophers have\nstressed. On the one hand, existence questions seem hard. The\nphilosophical question of whether there are abstract entities does not\nseem to admit of an easy or trivial answer. At the same time, there\nseem to be trivial arguments settling questions like this in the\naffirmative. Consider for instance the arguments, \u201c2+2=4. So\nthere is a number which, when added to 2, yields 4. This something is\na number. So there are numbers\u201d, and \u201cFido is a dog. So\nFido has the property of being a dog. So there are properties.\u201d\nHow should one resolve this paradox? One response is: adopt\nfictionalism. The idea would be that in the philosophy room we do not\nspeak fictionally, but ordinarily we do. So in the philosophy room,\nthe question of the existence of abstract entities is hard; outside\nit, the question is easy. When, ordinarily, a speaker utters a\nsentence that semantically expresses a proposition that entails that\nthere are numbers, what she says is accurate so long as according to\nthe relevant fiction, there are numbers. But when she utters the same\nsentence in the philosophy room, she speaks literally and then what\nshe asserts is something highly non-trivial. The fictionalism that\nwould seem to be motivated by this reasoning is use fictionalism.\n\n(See, e.g., Yablo 2000a, Szab\u00f3 2001, Hofweber 2000, and\nThomasson 2013 for discussion of this type of argument. However, of\nthese authors, only Yablo uses the paradox of existence to motivate\nfictionalism. Szab\u00f3, Hofweber and Thomasson all offer other\ndiagnoses.) \n",
