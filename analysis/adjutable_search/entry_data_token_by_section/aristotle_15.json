    "main_text": "Rhetoric and the Arts\n13. Rhetoric and the Arts\n\n\n           \nAristotle regards rhetoric and the arts as belonging to the productive\nsciences. As a family, these differ from the practical sciences\nof ethics and politics, which concern human conduct, and from the\ntheoretical sciences, which aim at truth for its own sake. \nBecause they are concerned with the creation of human products broadly\nconceived, the productive sciences include activities with obvious,\nartefactual products like ships and buildings, but also agriculture and\nmedicine, and even, more nebulously, rhetoric, which aims at the\nproduction of persuasive speech (Rhet. 1355b26; cf.\nTop. 149b5), and tragedy, which aims at\nthe production of edifying drama (Poet.\n1448b16\u201317).   If we bear in mind that Aristotle\napproaches all these activities within the broader context of his\nteleological explanatory framework, then at least some of the highly\npolemicized interpretative difficulties which have grown up around his\nworks in this area, particularly the Poetics, may be sharply\ndelimited. \n\n\n           \nOne such controversy centers on the question of whether\nAristotle\u2019s Rhetoric and Poetics are primarily\ndescriptive or prescriptive\n works.[25] \n To the degree that they are indeed\nprescriptive, one may wonder whether Aristotle has presumed in these\ntreatises to dictate to figures of the stature of Sophocles and\nEuripides how best to pursue their crafts. To some\nextent\u2014but only to some extent\u2014it may seem that he\ndoes. There are, at any rate, clearly prescriptive elements in\nboth these texts. Still, he does not arrive at these\nrecommendations a priori. Rather, it is plain that\nAristotle has collected the best works of forensic speech and tragedy\navailable to him, and has studied them to discern their more and less\nsuccessful features. In proceeding in this way, he aims to\ncapture and codify what is best in both rhetorical practice and\ntragedy, in each case relative to its appropriate productive goal.\n\n\nThe general goal of rhetoric is clear. Rhetoric, says Aristotle,\n\u2018is the power to see, in each case, the possible ways to\npersuade\u2019 (Rhet. 1355b26). Different contexts, however,\nrequire different techniques. Thus, suggests Aristotle, speakers will\nusually find themselves in one of three contexts where persuasion is\nparamount: deliberative (Rhet. i 4\u20138), epideictic\n(Rhet. i 9), and judicial (Rhet. i 10\u201314). In each\nof these contexts, speakers will have at their disposal three main\navenues of persuasion: the character of the speaker, the emotional\nconstitution of the audience, and the general argument\n(logos) of the speech itself (Rhet. i 3). Rhetoric\nthus examines techniques of persuasion pursuant to each of these\nareas. \n\n\nWhen discussing these techniques, Aristotle draws heavily upon topics\ntreated in his logical, ethical, and psychological writings. In this\nway, the Rhetoric illuminates Aristotle\u2019s writings in these\ncomparatively theoretical areas by developing in concrete ways topics\ntreated more abstractly elsewhere. For example, because a successful\npersuasive speech proceeds alert to the emotional state of the\naudience on the occasion of its delivery, Aristotle\u2019s\nRhetoric contains some of his most nuanced and specific\ntreatments of the emotions.    Heading in another\ndirection, a close reading of the Rhetoric reveals that\nAristotle treats the art of persuasion as closely akin to dialectic\n(see \u00a74.3 above). Like dialectic, rhetoric trades in\ntechniques that are not scientific in the strict sense (see \u00a74.2\nabove), and though its goal is persuasion, it reaches its end best if\nit recognizes that people naturally find proofs and well-turned\narguments persuasive (Rhet. 1354a1, 1356a25,\n1356a30).   Accordingly, rhetoric, again like dialectic,\nbegins with credible opinions (endoxa), though mainly of the\npopular variety rather than those endorsed most readily by the wise\n(Top. 100a29\u201335; 104a8\u201320; Rhet.\n1356b34). Finally, rhetoric proceeds from such opinions to\nconclusions which the audience will understand to follow by cogent\npatterns of inference (Rhet. 1354a12\u201318,\n1355a5\u201321). For this reason, too, the rhetorician will do\nwell understand the patterns of human reasoning. \n\n\nFor more on Aristotle\u2019s rhetoric, see the entry on \n Aristotle\u2019s Rhetoric.\n\n\nBy highlighting and refining techniques for successful speech, the\nRhetoric is plainly prescriptive\u2014but only relative to\nthe goal of persuasion.   It does not, however, select its\nown goal or in any way dictate the end of persuasive speech: rather,\nthe end of rhetoric is given by the nature of the craft itself. \nIn this sense, the Rhetoric is like both the Nicomachean\nEthics and the Politics in bearing the stamp of\nAristotle\u2019s broad and encompassing teleology. \n\n\nThe same holds true of the Poetics, but in this case the\nend is not easily or uncontroversially articulated. It is often\nassumed that the goal of tragedy is catharsis\u2014the\npurification or purgation of the emotions aroused in a tragic\nperformance. Despite its prevalence, as an interpretation of what\nAristotle actually says in the Poetics this understanding is\nunderdetermined at best. When defining tragedy in a general way,\nAristotle claims:\n\n\nTragedy, then, is an imitation of an action that is serious and\ncomplete, and which has some greatness about it. It imitates in words\nwith pleasant accompaniments, each type belonging separately to the\ndifferent parts of the work. It imitates people performing actions and\ndoes not rely on narration. It achieves, through pity and fear, the\ncatharsis of these sorts of feelings. (Poet.\n1449b21\u201329)\n\n\n\n\nAlthough he has been represented in countless works of scholarship\nas contending that tragedy is for the sake of catharsis,\nAristotle is in fact far more circumspect. While he does contend\nthat tragedy will effect or accomplish catharsis, in so speaking he\ndoes not use language which clearly implies that catharsis is in itself\nthe function of tragedy. Although a good blender will achieve a\nblade speed of 36,000 rotations per minute, this is not its function;\nrather, it achieves this speed in service of its function, namely\nblending. Similarly, then, on one approach, tragedy achieves\ncatharsis, though not because it is its function to do so.  \nThis remains so, even if it is integral to realizing its function that\ntragedy achieve catharsis\u2014as it is equally integral that it makes\nus of imitation (mim\u00easis), and does so by using words\nalong with pleasant accompaniments (namely, rhythm, harmony, and song;\nPoet. 1447b27). \n\n\n           \nUnfortunately, Aristotle is not completely forthcoming on the question\nof the function of tragedy.   One clue towards his attitude\ncomes from a passage in which he differentiates tragedy from historical\nwriting:\n\n\nThe poet and the historian differ not in that one writes in meter and\nthe other not; for one could put the writings of Herodotus into verse\nand they would be history none the less, with or without meter.  The\ndifference resides in this: the one speaks of what has happened, and\nthe other of what might be. Accordingly, poetry is more philosophical\nand more momentous than history. The poet speaks more of the\nuniversal, while the historian speaks of particulars. It is universal\nthat when certain things turn out a certain way someone will in all\nlikelihood or of necessity act or speak in a certain way\u2014which\nis what the poet, though attaching particular names to the situation,\nstrives for (Poet. 1451a38\u20131451b10).\n\n \n\n\nIn characterizing poetry as more philosophical, universal, and\nmomentous than history, Aristotle praises poets for their ability to\nassay deep features of human character, to dissect the ways in which\nhuman fortune engages and tests character, and to display how human\nfoibles may be amplified in uncommon circumstances. We do not,\nhowever, reflect on character primarily for entertainment value. \nRather, and in general, Aristotle thinks of the goal of tragedy in\nbroadly intellectualist terms: the function of tragedy is\n\u2018learning, that is, figuring out what each thing is\u2019\n(Poet. 1448b16\u201317). In Aristotle\u2019s view,\ntragedy teaches us about ourselves. \n\n\n           \nThat said, catharsis is undoubtedly a key concept in Aristotle\u2019s\nPoetics, one which, along with imitation\n(mim\u00easis), has generated enormous\n controversy.[26] \n These\ncontroversies center around three poles of interpretation: the\nsubject of catharsis, the matter of the catharsis,\nand the nature of catharsis. To illustrate what is\nmeant:  on a na\u00efve understanding of catharsis\u2014which may\nbe correct despite its na\u00efvet\u00e9\u2014the audience\n(the subject) undergoes catharsis by having the emotions (the\nmatter) of pity and fear it experiences purged (the\nnature). By varying just these three possibilities, scholars have\nproduced a variety of interpretations\u2014that it is the actors or\neven the plot of the tragedy which are the subjects of catharsis, that\nthe purification is cognitive or structural rather than emotional, and\nthat catharsis is purification rather than purgation. On this\nlast contrast, just as we might purify blood by filtering it, rather\nthan purging the body of blood by letting it, so we might refine our\nemotions, by cleansing them of their more unhealthy elements, rather\nthan ridding ourselves of the emotions by purging them\naltogether. The difference is considerable, since on one view the\nemotions are regarded as in themselves destructive and so to be purged,\nwhile on the other, the emotions may be perfectly healthy, even though,\nlike other psychological states, they may be improved by\nrefinement. The immediate context of the Poetics does\nnot by itself settle these disputes conclusively. \n\n\n           \nAristotle says comparatively more about the second main concept of the\nPoetics, imitation (mim\u00easis). Although\nless controversial than catharsis, Aristotle\u2019s conception of\nmim\u00easis has also been\n debated.[27] \n Aristotle thinks that\nimitation is a deeply ingrained human proclivity. Like political\nassociation, he contends, mim\u00easis is\nnatural. We engage in imitation from an early age,\nalready in language learning by aping competent speakers as we learn,\nand then also later, in the acquisition of character by treating others\nas role models. In both these ways, we imitate because we learn\nand grow by imitation, and for humans, learning is both natural and a\ndelight (Poet. 1148b4\u201324). This same tendency, in\nmore sophisticated and complex ways, leads us into the practice of\ndrama. As we engage in more advanced forms of\nmim\u00easis, imitation gives way to representation\nand depiction, where we need not be regarded as attempting to\ncopy anyone or anything in any narrow sense of the term. \nFor tragedy does not set out merely to copy what is the case, but\nrather, as we have seen in Aristotle\u2019s differentiation of tragedy\nfrom history, to speak of what might be, to engage universal themes in\na philosophical manner, and to enlighten an audience by their\ndepiction. So, although mim\u00easis is at root simple\nimitation, as it comes to serve the goals of tragedy, it grows more\nsophisticated and powerful, especially in the hands of those poets able\nto deploy it to good effect. \n",
