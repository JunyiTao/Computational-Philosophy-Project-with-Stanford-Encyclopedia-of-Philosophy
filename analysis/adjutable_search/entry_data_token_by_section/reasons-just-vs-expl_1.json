    "main_text": "Normative Reasons\n2. Normative Reasons\n\nA reason is said to be a \u201cnormative reason\u201d for acting\nbecause it favours someone\u2019s acting. But what does it mean to\nsay that a reason \u201cfavours\u201d an action? One way of\nunderstanding this claim is in terms of justification: a reason\njustifies or makes it right for someone to act in a certain way. This\nis why normative reasons are also called \u201cjustifying\u201d\nreasons.\n\nThe term \u201cnormative reason\u201d derives from the idea that\nthere are norms, principles or codes that prescribe actions: they make\nit right or wrong to do certain things. To take a relatively trivial,\nculturally-determined example, the norms of etiquette in some\ncountries say that when meeting someone for the first time, the right\nthing to do is to shake hands, whereas in other countries, the right\nthing to do is to kiss them on both cheeks. So the fact that in the UK\nshaking hands is the norm of etiquette is a reason that makes it right\nto do so in the UK when you meet someone for the first time. There are\nmany other, often more important, norms, principles and values,\nimplicit or explicit, that make it right to do or not do certain\nthings. The existence of these norms or values depends on a variety of\nthings: logical and natural relations, conventions, rules and\nregulations, etc. And the norms or values may be moral, prudential,\nlegal, hedonic (relating to pleasure) or of some other kind. There are\nnormative reasons, therefore, corresponding to the variety of values\nand norms: normative reasons that are moral, prudential, legal,\nhedonic, etc.\n\nThe variety of norms or values that underpin normative reasons\nrequires some modification of the claim that reasons that favour\nactions make those actions right. If a reason favours my doing\nsomething, then I have a \u201cpro-tanto\u201d reason to do\nit: it is pro tanto (i.e., to that extent) right for me to do\nit. But there may be a reason against my doing it: a\npro-tanto reason not to do it. The fact that a joke is funny\nmay be a reason to tell it; but the fact that it\u2019ll embarrass\nsomeone may be a reason against doing so. In that case, I have a\npro-tanto reason to tell the joke and a different\npro-tanto reason not to tell it. Whether it would be right\nfor me to tell the joke, whether I have an\n\u201call-things-considered\u201d reason to tell it, will depend on\nwhether either of the reasons is stronger than the other. If so, that\nreason will override or \u201cdefeat\u201d the other reason. Only if\nthe pro-tanto reason for telling the joke is undefeated will\nit be right or justified all things considered for me to tell the\njoke.\n\nBut what sort of thing is a normative reason? What gives reasons their\nnormative force, so that they can make it right for someone to do\nsomething? And what determines whether there is such a reason and to\nwhom it applies? These and related questions have received much\nphilosophical attention in recent years.\n\nThere is consensus that normative reasons are facts (Raz 1975; Scanlon\n1998), though the consensus is not universal. The question is\ncomplicated by disagreement about what facts of any kind are: are they\nconcrete or abstract entities? Is a fact the same as the corresponding\ntrue proposition, or is the fact the \u201ctruth-maker\u201d of the\nproposition? Are there any facts other than empirical facts, e.g.,\nlogical, mathematical, moral or aesthetic facts? For instance, it has\nbeen argued, notably by John Mackie, that there are no moral facts.\nMackie argued against the existence of moral facts partially on the\ngrounds that they would be metaphysically \u201cqueer\u201d. He held\nthat, if there are any moral facts, they would have to be both\nobjective and necessarily motivating to those who are aware of them,\nand he claimed that it was wholly implausible that anything could have\nsuch properties (Mackie 1977). If Mackie is right that there are no\nmoral facts, then either moral reasons are not normative reasons; or\nat least some normative reasons namely, moral reasons, are not\nfacts.\n\nAmong those who hold that normative reasons are facts, some hold that\nfacts are true propositions and hence that reasons are also true\npropositions (Darwall 1983; Smith 1994; Scanlon 1998). Others reject\nthe idea that normative reasons could be true propositions; for\ninstance, Dancy (2000) does so on the grounds that propositions are\nabstract and representational (they represent the way the world is)\nbut reasons must be concrete and non-representational (they are ways\nthe world is). These problems are complex and have many ramifications\nbut we cannot and perhaps need not resolve them here because the view\nthat normative reasons are facts is generally meant to imply a very\nundemanding notion of facts. Thus Raz says that, \u201cwhen saying\nthat facts are reasons\u201d he is using the term \u201cfact\u201d\nto designate \n\n\nthat in virtue of which true or justified statements are true or\njustified. By \u201cfact\u201d is meant simply that which can be\ndesignated by the use of the operator \u201cthe fact that\n\u2026\u201d. (1975: 17\u201318)\n\n\nThere is less consensus about the basis of the normativity of\npractical reasons: the capacity of reasons to justify actions. On one\nproposal, the normativity of practical reasons depends on the\ngoodness, intrinsic or instrumental, of doing what there is reason to\ndo. This view is associated with Aristotle who, in the Nicomachean\nEthics, links what is right to do (what one has reason to do)\nwith what is conducive to the good (whether intrinsically or\ninstrumentally). The idea was prevalent among medieval philosophers,\nfor example Thomas Aquinas (Summa Theologiae, 1a, q.82), and\nin the 20th century it was central to Elizabeth\nAnscombe\u2019s discussion of intentional actions (1957). Many\ncontemporary philosophers (e.g., Raz 1999 and Dancy 2000) have offered\naccounts of the normativity of reasons in line with this idea, so a\nreason is a normative reason to do something because it picks the\ngood-making features or value of the relevant action. As Raz puts it,\n\u201creasons are facts in virtue of which (\u2026) actions are\ngood in some respect and to some degree\u201d (1999: 23). There are\nother accounts that ground the normativity of reasons on the concept of\nrationality (e.g., Korsgaard 1996, who is influenced by Kant; and\nSmith 1994 and Gert 2004, who base their accounts on the concept of\nthe \u201cideally rational agent\u201d). A different proposal, which\nechos Hume\u2019s views about the relation between reason and\npassions, claims that the normativity of reasons is based on their\nrelation to our desires. Accordingly, what one has reason to do\ndepends ultimately on one\u2019s desires and motivations. Roughly,\nsomeone\u2019s having a reason to act requires their having some\nmotivation that would be served by acting in the way favoured by the\nputative reason. The motivation may be such things as desires, plans,\nlong-standing projects or values. And it may be something the agent\nactually has, or something she would have if she reasoned properly\nfrom her current motivations. Desire-based accounts of this sort have\nbeen defended recently by Williams 1979 and 1989, Schroeder 2008, and\nGoldman 2009.\n\nHowever we explain their normativity, normative reasons should be\ncapable of motivating agents to act\u2014though of course they may\noften fail to do so. Therefore, any account of normative reasons must\noffer a plausible explanation of the relationship between the\nnormativity of reasons and the capacity that reasons have to motivate\nagents to act. An account must explain how thinking that there is a\nreason for me to do something can motivate me to act, and to act\nfor that reason. Desire-based accounts of reasons might seem\nto have the edge here. If the reasons that apply to me depend on my\nantecedent motivations (desires, plans), then it is plausible that I\nshall be motivated to do what I believe will contribute to the\nsatisfaction or furthering of those motivations. But desire-based\naccounts fare less well in accommodating another central claim about\nnormative reasons. For it seems equally plausible that there are\nreasons (for instance, moral reasons) that apply to agents regardless\nof their motivations. Arguably, we all have reason to do what morality\ndictates, whether or not we are (or would be, if we reasoned\nconsistently from our current motivations), motivated by those\nreasons. (For a detailed discussion of these issues, see the entry on\n reasons for action: internal vs. external.)\n\nThe claim that something is a normative reason for action is generally\nthought to be a \u201crelational\u201d claim: it establishes a\nrelation between a fact, an agent, and an action kind. The relation is\nthat of \u201cbeing a reason for\u201d (see Raz 1975 and 1998, Dancy\n2004, Cuneo 2007). For example, the fact that a person has ingested a\nlethal poison may be a reason for the paramedics to give the person an\nantidote. According to some, the relation involves not just a person,\na reason and an action, but more aspects: a time, circumstances, etc.\n(Skorupski 2010 and Scanlon 2014). This relational view of reasons\ngives a minimal sense in which claims about normative reasons are\n\u201cagent-relative\u201d: they relate agents to reasons (a more\nsubstantial sense is developed in Nagel 1970 and 1986 and discussed in\nthe entry\n reasons for action: agent-neutral vs. agent-relative).\n But even in the minimal sense, the agent-relativity of reasons raises\nquestions about the conditions that determine when a reason for acting\napplies to a particular agent. One such question, mentioned in the\nprevious paragraph, is whether the reasons that apply to you depend on\nyour desires and motivations. Another question is whether they depend\non your knowledge and beliefs. To go back to the example of Othello:\non the one hand it seems clear that Othello has no reason to kill\nDesdemona, and the reason he thinks he has\u2014that she is\nunfaithful\u2014is no reason at all. On the other hand, it might seem\nthat Othello does have a reason, for he believes that Desdemona is\nunfaithful and believes, moreover, that his reputation has been\ndamaged and needs to be restored with her death. And those beliefs\nappear to give him a reason to do what he does, at least from his\nperspective.\n\nPhilosophers disagree about how to reconcile these competing claims.\nOne way of resolving the tension between them is to say that Othello\nhas no normative reason to kill Desdemona but has a\nmotivating reason: viz., the falsehood he believes. Smith\n(1994) and Dancy (2000) both offer suggestions of this sort (though\nSmith calls Othello\u2019s beliefs \u201chis normative\nreasons\u201d). Others, e.g., Schroeder (2008), talk about\n\u201cobjective\u201d and \u201csubjective\u201d normative\nreasons, so that Othello would have a subjective normative reason but\nno objective normative reason to kill Desdemona. These positions are\nall \u201cobjectivist\u201d in that they presuppose that whether an\nagent has an (objective) normative reason to act depends solely on the\nfacts and not on the agent\u2019s beliefs (see Williams 1979).\n\u201cPerspectivists\u201d take a different view. They claim that\nwhether someone has a normative reason to do something is not\nindependent of her perspective, which includes her beliefs (see Fantl\nand McGrath 2009 and Gibbons 2010). Certain cases of ignorance and\nmistake help to bring out their view. A much discussed case introduced\nby Williams (1979) concerns an agent, call him Sam, who orders a gin\nand tonic and, when served a glass with a liquid that looks like gin\nand tonic, forms the belief that it is gin and tonic, when in fact the\nglass contains petrol and ice. Does Sam have a normative reason to\ndrink what\u2019s in the glass? The objectivists say that the answer\ndepends solely on the facts, so Sam has no normative reason to drink\nthe liquid. Perspectivists, by contrast, say that given Sam\u2019s\nperspective, which includes a reasonable (though false) belief that\nthe liquid is gin and tonic, Sam does have a normative reason to drink\nwhat\u2019s in the glass.\n\nPerspectivists tend to defend their position by reference to\nconsiderations of rationality. Agents are often in situations in which\nthey don\u2019t know all the relevant facts. And yet, perspectivists\nsay, these agents often do what is reasonable or rational for them to\ndo, given their perspective. If, as seems plausible, one acts\nrationally when one acts for reasons that make it rational for one to\nso act, then perspectivism must be right: agents who act in error or\nignorance often act rationally and, when they do, they act for reasons\nthey have to do what they do. In short, as perspectivism says, the\nnormative reasons an agent has depend in an important sense on his\nepistemic perspective, and so an agent can have a normative reason\nthat is a false belief. Similar arguments are articulated in relation\nto justification (though often questions about rationality and\njustification are run together). Surely, the argument goes, what an\nagent is justified in doing depends on whether he has reasons that\njustify his doing that thing. But, again, there are cases where an\nagent would surely be justified in doing something even though there\nare conclusive reasons against doing it; and he would be justified\nprecisely because he doesn\u2019t know about those reasons. For\nexample, the fact that the cake is poisoned is a conclusive reason not\nto offer it to your guests. But you might be justified in offering it\nto them, the perspectivist says, if you don\u2019t know about the\npoison. So considerations about the justification of action also seem\nto support perspectivism because they show that what reasons you have\ndepends on your perspective.\n\nThere are several moves that an opponent of perspectivism can make in\nresponse here. She can concede that an agent who acts according to his\nepistemic perspective but guided by a false belief acts rationally,\nbut deny that acting rationally requires that the agent act for\nnormative reasons. Instead, the objectivist may say, acting rationally\nonly requires acting in a way that is consistent with one\u2019s\nbeliefs, so long as these are themselves rational. This response could\nrely on, e.g., Derek Parfit\u2019s conception of rationality, which\nrequires acting guided by one\u2019s real or apparent reasons (Parfit\n2001, an \u201capparent reason\u201d is a falsehood that an agent\nbelieves to be true, and treats as a normative reason but which is not\na normative reason; see also Kolodny 2005). As for the justification\nof action, the objectivist can deny that the actions of agents who act\nin ignorance or guided by a mistaken belief are justified. Whether the\naction is justified, the objectivist will say, depends purely on\nwhether the facts make it the right thing to do, and not on the\nagent\u2019s beliefs. So in the cake example above, the action of\noffering the poisoned cake to his guests is not justified: there is no\nnormative reason that makes it the right thing to do. And that is so\nregardless of what the agent knows or believes. A different question,\nthe objectivist will say, is whether an agent who does something wrong\nbecause of his false beliefs or ignorance is himself justified and/or\nblameworthy for so acting. If our host\u2019s ignorance about the\npoison is not culpable, he will most likely not be blameworthy and the\nagent may be justified. But in saying this, the objectivist need not\nbe conceding that the action was justified, i.e., done for a\nnormative reason, only that the host may be exculpated for doing the\nwrong thing. As Austin noted (1957), we must distinguish between a\njustification and an excuse. When accused of wrongdoing, one may offer\na justification, which aims to show that in fact the thing done was\nright because there was reason for doing it. Alternatively, one may\noffer an excuse: admit that one did the wrong thing but plead to be\npartly or wholly exculpated\u2014for instance, because it was done\nout of ignorance or mistake. (There are other excuses, such as\naccidents or coercion but those need not concern us here.) To return\nto the cake example, our agent might be excused for doing the wrong\nthing (poisoning the guests) if he was non-culpably ignorant about the\npoison. By contrast, it might be possible to give a justification for\npoisoning the guests: for instance, that they were in fact some\npsychopaths intent on causing his family mortal harm. If so, poisoning\nthem with the cake may have been the right thing to do and, depending\non whether our agent was aware of the relevant facts and acted guided\nby them, it may be that he was justified in poisoning them.\nThis example shows how questions about normative reasons bear directly\non the justification of agents, as distinct from the justification of\ntheir actions, by raising questions about motivating reasons, to which\nwe now turn.\n",
