    "main_text": "General Observations\n1. General Observations\n\nThe range of issues, puzzles and questions that fall within\nmetaethics\u2019 purview are consistently abstract. They reflect the\nfact that metaethics involves an attempt to step back from particular\nsubstantive debates within morality to ask about the views,\nassumptions, and commitments that are shared by those who engage in\nthe debate. By and large, the metaethical issues that emerge as a\nresult of this process of stepping back can be addressed without\ntaking a particular stand on substantive moral issues that started the\nprocess. In fact, metaethics has seemed to many to offer a crucial\nneutral background against which competing moral views need to be seen\nif they are to be assessed properly. Indeed, some metaethicists go so\nfar as to hold that their own work makes no substantive moral\nassumptions at all and has no practical\n implications.[2]\n Whether any view that is recognizably still a view about the nature\nand status of ethics could manage this is dubious. But there is no\ndoubt that, whatever metaethics\u2019s substantive assumptions and\npractical implications might be, it involves reflecting on the\npresuppositions and commitments of those engaging in moral thought,\ntalk, and practice and so abstracting away from particular moral\njudgments.\n\nSuch reflection quickly reveals the extent to which various aspects of\nmorality might reasonably be seen as both intellectually and\npractically problematic. On the intellectual side, many have worried\nthat there is no good way to vindicate the assumptions and commitments\nof morality. A careful and clear-eyed study of morality will reveal,\nsome argue, that it is a myth that there are moral values, duties, or\nresponsibilities; others argue that the various principles that are\npresented as authoritative standards for all are actually merely\nexpressions of emotion or projections of the idiosyncratic attitudes\nof those advocating the principles; still others argue that in some\nother way morality is not what it pretends to be and not what it needs\nto be if it is to be legitimate. On the practical side, many have\npressed the difficulty of getting people to judge themselves and\nothers impartially; others have worried that, while we have an\ninterest in convincing others to conform to morality, we ourselves\nrarely have any reason, really, to conform; still others have thought\nthat the sort of freedom morality assumes is not available to humans\nas they actually are.\n\nOf course these worries and arguments regularly find counterparts on\nthe other side, with people maintaining that, properly understood,\nmorality is no myth, that its pretensions can be vindicated, that we\nhave all the reason we need to embrace morality and meet its demands,\nand that people, at least some people under some circumstances, have\nwhatever sort of freedom it is that morality might require.\n\nNone of the arguments, on either side, can go quickly or easily. They\nall depend, first, on identifying and defending the presuppositions\nand commitments one takes to be at issue and then, second, on showing\nthat those commitments either cannot, or can, be defended. What is at\nstake is, at least, an understanding of what is an important part of\nmost peoples\u2019 lives. Yet there is potentially a lot more at\nstake to the extent the presuppositions and commitments people take\nfor granted turn out to be suspect. For then, not only will our\nunderstanding of moral thought, talk, and practice be\ncompromised, our sense that morality is important may well disappear\nas well.\n\nDespite the abstract and deeply controversial nature of metaethics,\nits central concerns arise naturally\u2014perhaps even\ninevitably\u2014as one reflects critically on one\u2019s own moral\nconvictions. So it is no surprise that, in Plato\u2019s\nRepublic, Polemarchus\u2019 off-hand claim that being a just\nperson enhances one\u2019s life developed quickly into a decidedly\nmetaethical discussion of the origin and nature of justice. Early in\nBook I, for instance, Thrasymachus defends the idea that justice is\nwhatever is in the interest of the stronger, arguing that morality is\na human creation designed by the rich and powerful to control and\nexploit others. A myth for the weak-minded, arranged for the advantage\nof a few, justice imposes burdens most have reason to set aside. So\nThrasymachus argues. Glaucon follows up, in Book II, with an\nalternative, and less cynical, proposal. While he too sees morality as\na human creation, he sees it as a salutary solution to the serious\nproblems we would otherwise face. He argues that people naturally find\nthemselves unable successfully to ensure that their own wills will\nrule while, simultaneously, being subject regularly to the will of\nothers. The principles of justice are, he thinks, reasonably\nintroduced and enforced by all as a good way to ensure peace and\nstability in society. Socrates, in contrast, rejects the idea that\njustice is a human invention and argues instead that justice provides\nindependent and eternal standards against which human practices,\nconventions, and institutions can be judged. These different views\nwill likely have implications for what value justice might have. At\nthe same time, though, accepting one or the other view of the nature\nof justice is compatible with a range of substantive views about what,\nspecifically, justice consists in and about its value. On the one\nhand, one might see justice as a social convention while still holding\nthat the relevant conventions are in place whenever they are enforced\nby the powerful or that only mutually advantageous conventions\nestablish justice. On the other hand, one might see justice as\ntranscending human invention and conventions entirely and yet hold\nthat they either demand treating others with respect or with promoting\ntheir happiness.\n",
