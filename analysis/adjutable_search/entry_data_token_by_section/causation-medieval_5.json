Causality, Knowledge and Necessity\n\n\nThere is a persistent supposition \u2013 see, for example, (Gilson\n1937) \u2013 that Ockham, and many of his fourteenth-century\nfollowers, had a basically Humean position on causality; this\nsupposition has deep historical roots (Nadler 1996), but is inaccurate\n(Adams 1987, pp.  741ff.).\n\n\nThe supposedly Humean position has three basic assertions: that\nthere is nothing more to causality than the regular sequence of\nphenomena, that such a regular sequence cannot give a necessary\nconnection, and that, consequently, we can have no certain knowledge of\ncausal relations.\n\n\nOne item in this chain of argument has some textual support in\nOckham: he did not believe that the relation of efficient causality was\na thing distinct from its relata (Ockham,\nQuodlibet VI, qu. 12: Opera Theologica IX, pp.\n629ff.) However, one can still believe this and hold that causality is\na real relation, and Ockham did so believe (Adams 1987, p.\n744; White 1990b). So this link in the chain is not found in\nOckham.\n\n\nThe \u201cHumean\u201d argument, in addition, makes a detour through\npsychology: as Adams analyses it, it relies on a premise like \u201cThere\ncan be nothing more in concepts than there actually is in intuitions\u201d\n(Adams 1987, p. 744). But such a detour through psychology, though\nwidely practiced in the eighteenth century, was somewhat foreign to\nmedieval thought (White 1990a). And one should generally be very\ncircumspect in interpreting medieval texts on issues like\nthese: key terms tend to be used in subtly different ways \nthan in the modern literature, and controversies tend to be\nabout issues which are rather different from our controversies\n(Zupko 2001).\n\n\nEven though pseudo-Humean arguments of this sort cannot reasonably\nbe ascribed to Ockham or to most other medieval thinkers \u2013 with the\npossible exception of Nicholas of Autrecourt \u2013 there still remains the\nquestion of what their views on these questions actually were. Since\nthe medievals generally did not conflate ontological and\nepistemological issues, there are two questions: first about the\nnecessity of causality, and second about whether we can know causal\npropositions with certainty.\n",
