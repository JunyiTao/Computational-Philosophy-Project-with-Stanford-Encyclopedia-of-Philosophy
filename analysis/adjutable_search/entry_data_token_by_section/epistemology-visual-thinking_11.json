    "main_text": "A priori and a posteriori roles of visual experience || Evidential uses of visual experience\n6.1 Evidential uses of visual experience\nA plausible example of the evidential use of sensory experience is\nthe case of a child coming to know that \\(5 + 3 = 8\\) by counting on\nher fingers. While there may be an important \\(a\\) priori\nelement in the child\u2019s appreciation that she can reliably\ngeneralise from the result of her counting experiment, getting that\nresult by counting is an a posteriori route to it. For\nanother example, consider the question: how many vertices does a cube\nhave? With the background knowledge that cubes do not vary in shape\nand that material cubes do not differ from geometrical cubes in number\nof vertices (where a \u201cvertex\u201d of a material cube is a\ncorner), one can find the answer by visually inspecting a material\ncube. Or if one does not have a material cube to hand, one can\nvisually imagine a cube, and by attending to its top and bottom faces\nextract the information that the vertices of the cube are exactly the\nvertices of these two quadrangular faces. When one gets the answer by\ninspecting a material cube, the visual experience contributes to\none\u2019s grounds for believing the answer and that contribution is\npart of what makes the belief state knowledge. So the role of the\nvisual experience is evidential; hence the resulting knowledge is not\na priori. When one gets the answer by visually imagining a\ncube, one is drawing on the accumulated cognitive effects of past\nexperiences of seeing material cubes to bring to mind what a cube\nlooks like; so the experience of visual imagining has an indirectly\nevidential role in this case.\nDo such examples show that mathematics is not an a priori\nscience? Yes, if an a priori science is understood to be one\nwhose knowable truths are all knowable only in an a\npriori way, without use of sense experience as evidence. No, if\nan a priori science is one whose knowable truths are all\nknowable in an a priori way, allowing that some may be\nknowable also in an a posteriori way.\n",
