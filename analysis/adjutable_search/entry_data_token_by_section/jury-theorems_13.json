Diversity affects not only the judgment profile in the group at\nany given moment, and hence the aggregation process, but also the\ndeliberation process. Deliberation owes its richness and fruitfulness\nlargely to diversity. Non-diverse bodies gain little from\ndeliberating: their members already reason similarly, take similar\nperspectives, know similar things, etc. In diverse bodies,\ndeliberation can broaden the informational, perspectival, and\nmethodological horizon. The more diversity, the more potential for\njudgment revision through deliberation.\n\nCausal graphs help to understand how diversity affects deliberation.\nThink of the votes (judgments) as embedded in a causal graph. Each\nindividual\u2019s vote is a (probabilistic) causal consequence of\nthis individual\u2019s judgment sources: informational sources,\nintellectual influences, etc. The more the sources differ across\nindividuals, the more diverse the group is. In deliberation, members\nshare their sources. This changes the causal structure: whenever a\nsource is shared with an individual \\(i\\), a causal arrow is added\nfrom that source to \\(i\\)\u2019s vote. This enlarges a voter\u2019s\nspectrum of sources.\n\n\n\nFigure 4. Source sharing through\ndeliberation. [An\n extended description of Figure 4\n is in the supplement.]\n\n\nFigure 4\n gives an illustration with just two sources and three individuals.\nSource sharing makes the basis of judgments more similar across\nindividuals, possibly letting judgments converge. Ideal deliberation\nachieves full source sharing, as in Figure 4. The more diverse the\ngroup was initially, the more sources there are to share, hence the\nmore deliberation can \u201cdo\u201d.\n\nWhile deliberation reduces interindividual diversity by removing\nsource asymmetries, it creates intraindividual diversity by widening\nthe spectrum of someone\u2019s sources. Individuals\n\u201cinternalise\u201d diversity when deliberating.\n",
