    "main_text": "Evaluation of Legal Rules and Institutions || Preference and Well-being\n6.1 Preference and Well-being\n\nCall an ordering that incorporates every consideration that the agent\nviews as relevant to her decision \u201can extended preference\nordering\u201d. Kaplow and Shavell include the agent\u2019s moral\nconcerns in this extended preference ordering. We may call this\napproach the \u201cstrategy of incorporation.\u201d \n\nA complete argument that the extended preference ordering does not\ncorrespond to a morally compelling conception of well-being would\nrequire articulation of the concept of well-being, a task well beyond\nthe scope of this entry. Here we outline two formal arguments against\nthe strategy of incorporation that treats the agent\u2019s moral\nconcerns, her views about equality, fairness, and distributive and\ncorrective justice more generally, as elements of well-being.\n\nWe broached the first formal argument in section 4. There we noted\nthat not every norm could be integrated with self-interested concerns\ninto an all-things-considered set of judgments that satisfied the\nformal conditions of a preference. To succeed, the strategy of\nincorporation must show that each of the agent\u2019s moral\n\u201ctastes\u201d or concerns have a normative structure that is\ncompatible with her underlying, self-interested preferences. The\nstrategy of incorporation thus might fail because of the structure of\nthe obligations that the agent endorses.\n\nSecond, a welfarist theory distinguishes between the well-being of\neach agent and the criteria that determine the structure of the social\nwelfare\n function.[31]\n The theory, that is, distinguishes what makes an individual\u2019s\nlife go better and the concerns that determine how one integrates the\nwell-being of individuals into \u201csocial welfare.\u201d These\nlatter concerns weigh the well-being of individual J against\nthe well-being of individual K. Consider two states of the\nworld s and t. Agent J\u2019s well-being is\nhigher in state s than in state t while agent\nK\u2019s well-being is higher in state t than in state\ns. To rank the two states, society must determine the relative\nimportance of the well-being of the two individuals. \n\nMoral norms perform precisely this function. A moral norm determines\nwhen the well-being of agent J should take precedence over the\nwell-being of agent K. Indeed, we say that agent J has a\nright against agent K precisely when we think that the\ndecisions or choices of agent J should prevail over the\ndecisions or choices of agent K. The moral concerns of each\nagent thus reflect the agent\u2019s views about the structure of the\nsocial choice function, not (necessarily) her views about what\nconstitutes her own well-being. \n\nOf course, an agent might believe that her life goes better if she\nlives in a more egalitarian society. But she might also believe to the\ncontrary that her life would go better if she lived in a more\nhierarchical society. Then, the social structure would affect the\nagent\u2019s well-being. The choice of social structure, however, is\nnot dependent on the agent\u2019s well-being. The structure of the\nsocial choice function rather determines the social structure. Thus,\nan agent may believe that an egalitarian social welfare function is\nappropriate (or perhaps even \u201cbetter than\u201d a hierarchical\nsocial welfare function, but she may nonetheless believe that her own\nwell-being would be higher in a hierarchical society than in an\negalitarian one. \n\nThe social welfare function resolves conflicts of\n\u201cinterest\u201d between individuals. Moral disagreements,\nhowever, reflect not conflicts of interest but a dispute over how such\nconflicts should be resolved. The resolution of a moral conflict\ndetermines whose well-being counts not how much well-being the agent\nhas. The strategy of incorporation confuses these two\n concepts.[32]\n\nMany of the concerns that, under the strategy of incorporation, are\nincluded in an individual\u2019s extended preference ordering thus\nbear on the structure of the social choice function; they do not\nnecessarily make the agent\u2019s life go better. Concerns for\ndistributive justice, for example, reflect moral judgments about how\nto integrate different distributions of well-being. They do not\nreflect judgments about how well-off each agent\n is.[33]\n Similarly, respect for deontological constraints on action reflect\nthe judgment that the effects on the well-being of the constrained\nagent do not bear on our assessment of the social state. \n\nThe social welfare function aggregates or integrates the well-being of\neach individual in society into a social ranking of states. It does\nnot integrate or aggregate the differing views of the individuals\nconcerning the appropriate social welfare function. Conflicts over the\nappropriate social welfare function must be resolved through some\nseparate process. Society for example might vote on which social\nwelfare function to adopt. Such a vote might be justified on epistemic\ngrounds; it cannot be justified on social welfare grounds. We do not\nchoose our social welfare function in order to maximize social\n welfare.[34]\n\n",
