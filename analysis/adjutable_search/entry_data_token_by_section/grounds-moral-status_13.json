    "main_text": "Grounds of Moral Status || Special Relationships\n5.5 Special Relationships\n\nSome views attempt to ground strong reasons not to interfere, and\nperhaps also to aid and treat fairly, not only by appeal to\nsophisticated cognitive capacities but also by appeal to special\nrelationships (these are therefore disjunctive accounts). On such\naccounts, specific agents must not interfere with an\nindividual or must respect that individual\u2019s rights in virtue of\nbeing in a relationship with that individual. On one popular version,\nthe relevant relationship is being a fellow member of a community,\nwhere the community is composed of all those of the same biological\nspecies (Nozick 1997 and possibly Scanlon 1998, p.185).\n\nThe motivation for this version of the Special Relationship account\ncomes from thinking about the species relationship as analogous to\nother relationships (biological, social, etc.) that generate special\nduties and rights. For example, the relationship between a parent and\nhis child creates an especially strong reason for the parent not to\nkill and to aid his child. Also, some people believe that even a\ngamete donor has special reason to aid the resulting child.\n\nOther authors focus on non-species relationships, either as sufficient\nconditions for FMS or as merely enhancers of moral status. Kittay\n(2005) holds that the biosocial relation of being someone\u2019s\nchild is sufficient for FMS while Stienbock (1992, pp.9, 13, and\n69\u201370) maintains that being someone\u2019s child only enhances\none\u2019s moral status. So, for example, having a well-being,\nsentience, or consciousness (all of which both animals and humans\nhave) might be sufficient for some moral status (e.g., weak rights not\nto be harmed and to be aided), but the status is full (e.g., the\nrights are at full strength) when the individual is in a specific\nrelationship with a moral agent. Instead of being someone\u2019s\nchild, the relationship might be co-belonging to a community where the\ncommunity\u2019s membership requirements need not be strictly\nbiological, but could be both biological and cognitive (see\nQuinn\u2019s discussion of rights of humanity 1984, pp.32\u201333\nand 50\u201354), or both biological and social (Warren 1997, p.\n176).\n\nAccording to Anderson (2004), the capacity for reciprocal\naccommodation with moral agents is a necessary (not sufficient)\ncondition of having rights (pp. 287\u20139). This may appear to be a\n5.3 type of view. However, unlike the capacities in 5.3, a rat, for\nexample, might fail to have this mutual accommodation capacity\nvis-\u00e0-vis most humans, and so would not have the right to be\nkilled by these humans; but the rat might nonetheless have this\ncapacity vis-\u00e0-vis other moral agents (human rat lovers,\nangels, etc.), and so might be able to gain this right from these\nagents based on additional conditions. When this capacity for mutual\naccommodation is combined with membership in the human society (which\ndoes not require being a human), then, according to Anderson, this is\nsufficient for a relationship that grounds rights to non-interference\nand aid from human beings, though perhaps not as strong as those\nassociated with FMS (p. 284).\n\nAll of these Special Relationship accounts escape one drawback of the\nMember of a Cognitively Sophisticated Species account. The reason not\nto interfere (or aid, etc.) is not based on being a token of a type\nwith morally irrelevant criteria for membership. Merely belonging to a\nspecies or other type of group is not the source of the reason not to\ninterfere. Instead, by being a member of a species or another group, a\ntoken individual is thereby in a relationship with another token\nmember of the group and this relationship is taken to be the source of\nthe reason not to interfere.\n\nInstead of the capacity for reciprocal accommodation, Gilbert\n(2018) holds that if the rights associated with FMS involve the\nauthority to demand respect for these rights, then such rights must be\ngrounded in an actual joint commitment (p. 332).\n\nA central problem with these approaches is that they do not truly\noffer an account of moral status, but only of particular agents\u2019\nreasons vis-\u00e0-vis the individual at issue. A being\u2019s\nmoral status should give every moral agent, whether human or not,\nreasons to protect that being (see section 2.4). But on these\naccounts, by contrast, only those moral agents who are members of the\nsame species, or are in some other special relationship with the\nbeing, have a reason, let us say, not to kill the being (McMahan 2005,\np. 355). For example, a human being, in virtue of being in a special\nrelationship (via species community) with a human infant, has a reason\nnot to kill the infant, but a Martian, if there were one, would not\nhave this reason, since he would lack this special relationship with\nthe human infant. Similarly, a human being does not have a reason not\nto kill an ape infant, even if adult apes are cognitively\nsophisticated, because the two are not in a special species-based\nrelationship. Reasons of this sort, constitutive of special\nobligations, are different in kind from, and contrasted with, reasons\nconstitutive of moral status, which are impartial. Recall the contrast\nbetween two reasons a parent has not to kill his child: the reason\nconstitutive of his parental obligation versus the impartial reason\nconstitutive of the child\u2019s moral status (section 2.4).\n\nPerhaps some Special Relationship accounts (e.g., Quinn\u2019s\ndiscussion of rights of humanity as distinct from rights of respect)\ndo not take themselves to be offering an account of FMS but rather\nonly to be capturing, e.g., a strong right against others to not be\nkilled (the key component of FMS). If so, they leave behind both the\nterm \u201cmoral status\u201d and the concept of impartiality. Other\nspecial relationship accounts (Steinbock\u2019s and Kittay\u2019s)\ndo use the term \u201cmoral status\u201d leaving it unclear whether\nthey think that special relationships could somehow generate impartial\nreasons.\n\nAnother concern with those Special Relationship accounts that attempt\nto ground rights and requirements analogous to those of FMS is that\nthey are overinclusive (although see exceptions below). If the\nrelevant relationship is one with those in one\u2019s social\ncommunity then, depending on how this is interpreted, any animal\nincorporated into human social communities (e.g., dogs) would gain\nstrong rights, contrary to the commonsense view. If the relevant\nrelationship is instead one with those in one\u2019s species\ncommunity, then all humans are in a special species relationship with\nan anencephalic human baby and so, according to such an account, owe\nit a high level of moral protection. But, as noted earlier, some would\nfind this counterintuitive. A related problem emerges once we notice\nthat humans might have more of a relationship with other\n\u201cembodied minds\u201d (i.e., any being with both a body and\nmind, such as an animal) than with human organisms that lack minds\n(such as an anencephalic baby). The Special Relationship approach\nwould then be committed to claiming that animals have stronger rights\nthan some cognitively impaired humans (McMahan 2002, pp.\n225\u2013226). But the account would not welcome these implications\nof its own approach and, if it did so, it would then suffer the\nproblem of overinclusiveness with respect to animals.\n\nQuinn\u2019s view (1984), although quite similar to the species\ncommunity relationship view, may not be overinclusive with respect to\nanencephalics or animals. Though Quinn does not consider this case, he\nwould likely conclude that anencephalic infants are mere human\norganisms, not human beings (because they lack the capacity to learn),\nor are at most partially, rather than fully, existent human beings.\nThus, they do not stand in a special relationship with other human\nbeings to the degree that unimpaired infants or cognitively impaired\nhuman beings with the capacity to learn do. Moreover, it is plausible\nto accept that we have more of a relationship with human beings in\nQuinn\u2019s sense, which are human embodied minds, than with\nnon-human embodied minds, such as animals. Steinbock\u2019s view also\nwould not be overinclusive with respect to anencephalics or animals,\nsince the full strength of rights she discusses requires both\nconsciousness and being someone\u2019s child.\n\nIt is less clear whether a view like Gilbert\u2019s (2018) is under-\nor overinclusive from the commonsense point of view. Making a joint\ncommitment requires exercising sophisticated cognitive capacities. If\nonly those who actually make joint commitments (to recognize the\nrights associated with FMS) thereby get such rights, then the view is\neven more underinclusive than those described in 5.1, since not all\nthose who can make such joint commitments actually do so (pp.\n341\u2013342). However, if the recipients of rights do not need to be\nmembers of the joint commitment that bestows such rights on them, then\nthe view could end up being overinclusive \u2013 the rights\nassociated with FMS could be extended to anencephalics and all\nanimals.\n\nInsofar as Special Relationship accounts intend to ground the notion\nof FMS without denying that cognitive sophistication alone can ground\nFMS, they will also suffer from another problem encountered earlier:\nthey are not unified since they offer two unconnected routes to FMS\n(sophisticated cognitive capacities or special relationships).\n",
