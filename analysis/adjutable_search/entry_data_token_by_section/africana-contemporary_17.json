    "main_text": "Reading the contemporary\u2014evolving themes || Political thought in context\n7.3 Political thought in context\n\nA third theme in contemporary work also has obvious roots in older\ntrends. As an enterprise \u201cborn of struggle,\u201d Africana\nphilosophy attends with unusual frequency and consistency to the\nethical and political issues facing its inquirers. The ethical\nimplications of studies in nearly every area, including metaphysics\n(related, say, to the concept of the person) and epistemology\n(related, say, to issues of testimonial injustice), are rarely far\nfrom view. But straightforward political philosophy remains as lively\nan area of investigation as it was when Odera Oruka famously\nidentified \u201cnationalist-ideological\u201d theorizing as one of\nthe four major areas of African philosophical activity (Oruka 1981,\nn.p.).\n\nAfricana philosophies of politics constitute much too massive an area\nto cover responsibly in anything like the space available here. In\naddition, this is an area in which regional and local differences loom\nparticularly large, thereby complicating any broad generalizations.\nNevertheless, three trends are worth noting.\n\nFirst, commentary on iconic figures remains a common undertaking,\nthough the range of figures available for this treatment has of course\nchanged over time. The iconic figures in each region remain live\noptions for study, as evidenced by recent special issues of the\nJournal on African Philosophy on Nkrumah and Azikiwe,\npersistent interest in a variety of venues in Du Bois and Cooper, and\nrecent attempts to rethink the legacies of Senghor and\n Cesaire.[12]\n The contemporary difference is that this work now more often shares\nspace with studies of people like C.L.R. James, Huey Newton, Lorraine\nHansberry, and bell\n hooks.[13]\n\nSecond, and similarly, while scholars continue to undertake\ncontext-sensitive investigations of particular, local issues, those\nissues have changed in the wake of certain epochal, geopolitical\nshifts. The sheer range of issues in play here is particularly\ndaunting, but Ivan Karp and D. A. Masolo provide a helpfully capacious\nframe. They suggest three roughly ten-year stages in the development\nof post-independence African philosophy. The 1970s, they say, were\nabout the ethnophilosophy debates, while the 1980s were about\ncriticizing African modes of cultural production, from traditional\npractices to elite intellectual work. The 1990s, meanwhile, took up a\nnew challenge:\n\n\nThis new phase \u2026 is both a response to and an attempt to\ntheorize the crisis of the postcolonial African state, and it\ncoincides with the emergence of economic, social, and environmental\nproblems that were not imagined to be possible in the utopian worlds\nof newly independent nations. (Karp and Masolo 2000, 2, as quoted in\nAfayolan and Falola 2017, 9)\n\n\nKarp and Masolo\u2019s (2000) description of this new, post-utopian\nphase tracks important dynamics unfolding in Africana communities\nacross the world. In some places it often took the form of reflections\non the disappointments of post-racialism, in many places focused\nintently on the exaggerated optimism and subsequent disappointments of\nthe Obama era. Elsewhere it took the form of reflections on\nneoliberalism or on the imperatives not of anti-colonial struggle or\npost-colonial critique but of decolonial transformation. Central to\nall these cases, though, was the challenge of adapting Africana\nphilosophical resources to evolving political conditions in the wake\nof the Cold War, in the throes of a global war on terror and a\nmultipolar scramble for post-imperial influence.\n\nA third trend shaping Africana philosophies of politics is simply that\na variety of new theories and concepts have come into play. Some of\nthese come, as we have seen, from exercises in critical\nethnophilosophy, like the ubuntu debates in South Africa. Others\nresult from creative conceptual engineering by attentive scholars\ngrappling with their social worlds. Consider here the notion of\nAfropolitanism, first authoritatively theorized in the early 2000s by\nAchille Mbembe, who used it to argue that \u201cthe meaning of\n\u2018being African\u2019 had to be dislodged from race \u2026 and\nbe opened to the flows of global networks and worldly\nhybridities\u201d (Balakrishnan 2017, \u00a74, par. 5). Or consider\nTommie Shelby\u2019s introduction and refusal of the \u201cmedical\nmodel\u201d of social theorizing in relation to urban\n\u201cghettos\u201d (Shelby 2016). Or, finally, consider the\ncontinuing reverberations from Mills\u2019s enormously influential\nracial contract argument (1997).\n\nMills and Shelby are particularly noteworthy in this connection. Until\ntheir early work earned the attention it now enjoys around the world\nand across academic disciplines, it was easier to worry that analytic\napproaches to Africana thought did relatively little with the\ntransformative potential that Africanaity brings to professional\nphilosophy (see Taylor 2009, Gordon 2006). But both have\nrecently called explicitly for \u201cblack radical\u201d approaches\nto standard political-theoretic positions like egalitarianism and\nliberalism (Mills 2017, Shelby 2016). And both have backed up this\ncall by reinventing core theoretical resources from one tradition in\nlight of the other. For example, Mills (1997) reworks the social\ncontract tradition by examining it from the perspective of (a kind of)\ndecolonial or black radicalism, while Shelby (2005) uses elements of\nRawlsian contract theory to rework the black nationalism of figures\nlike Crummell, Du Bois, and Karenga.\n",
