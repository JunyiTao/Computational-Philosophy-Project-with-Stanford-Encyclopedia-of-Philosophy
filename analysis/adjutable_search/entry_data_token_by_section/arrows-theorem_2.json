    "main_text": "Arrow\u2019s Framework || Individual Preferences\n2.1 Individual Preferences\nArrow assumed that social orderings will be derived, if at all,\nfrom information about people\u2019s preferences. This information is, in\nhis framework, merely ordinal. It is the kind of information\nthat is implicated in Condorcet\u2019s paradox of voting,\nin Section 1, where each person ranks the\nalternatives from better to worse but there is nothing beyond this\nabout how strong anybody\u2019s preferences are, or about how the\npreferences of one person compare in strength to those of another. In\nconfining aggregation procedures to ordinal information, Arrow argued\nthat:\n\n [I]t seems to make no sense to add the utility of\none individual, a psychic magnitude in his mind, with the utility of\nanother individual. (Arrow 1951 [1963]: 11)\n\n His point was that even if people do have\nstronger and weaker preferences, and even if the strengths of their\npreferences can somehow be measured and made available as a basis for\nsocial decisions, nevertheless ordinal information is all that\nmatters because preferences are \u201cinterpersonally\nincomparable\u201d. Intuitively, what this means is that there is no\nsaying how much more strongly someone must prefer one thing to\nanother in order to make up for the fact that someone else\u2019s\npreference is just the other way around. Arrow saw no reason to\nprovide aggregation procedures with information about the strength of preferences\nbecause he thought that they cannot put such information to\nmeaningful use. \nAccordingly, the preferences of individual people are represented\nin Arrow\u2019s framework by binary relations \\(R_{i}\\) among the\nalternatives: \\(xR_{i}y\\) means that individual \\(i\\) weakly\nprefers alternative \\(x\\) to alternative \\(y\\). That is, either\n\\(i\\) strictly prefers \\(x\\) to \\(y\\), or else \\(i\\)\nis indifferent between them, finding them equally good. Each\nindividual preference relation \\(R_{i}\\) is assumed to\nbe connected (for all alternatives \\(x\\) and \\(y\\), either\n\\(xR_{i}y\\), or \\(yR_{i}x\\), or both) and transitive (for all\n\\(x\\), \\(y\\) and \\(z\\), if \\(xR_{i}y\\) and \\(yR_{i}z\\), then\n\\(xR_{i}z\\)). That these relations have these structural properties\nwas, for Arrow, a matter of the \u201crationality\u201d of the\npreferences they represent; for further discussion, see the entries on\nPreferences and Philosophy of Economics. Connected, transitive\nrelations are called weak orderings. They are\n\u201cweak\u201d in that they allow ties\u2014in this connection,\nindifference.\n\nA preference profile is a list \\(\\langle R_{1}, \\ldots,\nR_{n}\\rangle\\) of weak orderings of the set \\(X\\) of alternatives, one\nfor each of the people \\(1, \\ldots, n\\). The list of three\nindividual orderings in the paradox of voting is an example of a\npreference profile for the alternatives \\(A\\), \\(B\\), and \\(C\\) and people\n1, 2, and 3. A profile is a representation of the individual\npreferences of everybody who will be consulted in the choice among the\nalternatives. It is in the form of profiles that Arrow\u2019s aggregation\nprocedures receive information about individual preferences. Often it\nis convenient to write \\(\\langle R_{i}\\rangle\\) instead of \\(\\langle\nR_{1}, \\ldots, R_{n}\\rangle\\). Other profiles are written \\(\\langle\nR^*_{i}\\rangle\\), and so on.\nIn restricting individual inputs to weak orderings of the\nalternatives, Arrow overlooked the possibility that people could input\ninformation about their preferences in the form of ordinal scores or\ngrades. Graded inputs enable an \u201cescape\u201d from Arrow\u2019s\nimpossibility that is explained in Section\n5.3. Amartya Sen extended Arrow\u2019s framework to take into account\nnot only ordinal information about people\u2019s preferences among pairs of\nalternatives, but also cardinal information about the utility\nthey derive from each one. In this way he was able to investigate the\nconsequences of other assumptions than Arrow\u2019s about the measurability\nand interpersonal comparability of individual\npreferences. See Section 5.4 and the\nentry social choice theory for details\nand references.\n",
