    "main_text": "\n\nSimpson\u2019s Paradox is a statistical phenomenon where an\nassociation between two variables in a population emerges, disappears\nor reverses when the population is divided into subpopulations. For\ninstance, two variables may be positively associated in a population,\nbut be independent or even negatively associated in all\nsubpopulations. Cases exhibiting the paradox are unproblematic from\nthe perspective of mathematics and probability theory, but\nnevertheless strike many people as surprising. Additionally, the\nparadox has implications for a range of areas that rely on\nprobabilities, including decision theory, causal inference, and\nevolutionary biology. Finally, there are many instances of the\nparadox, including in epidemiology and in studies of discrimination,\nwhere understanding the paradox is essential for drawing the correct\nconclusions from the data.\n\nThe following article provides a mathematical analysis of the paradox,\nexplains its role in causal reasoning and inference, compares theories\nof what makes the paradox seem paradoxical, and surveys its\napplications in different domains.\n",
