Political Ventures and Misadventures\n\nIt should be clear by this point that the philosophical stakes\ninvolved in the Kyoto School\u2019s thought are high\u2014indeed\nthey invite us to rethink many of our most basic concepts and ways of\nexperiencing the world and ourselves. For this very reason Kyoto\nSchool thinkers promise to be especially valuable partners in any\npost-Eurocentric forum of philosophical dialogue. Genuine philosophy,\nafter all, thrives on the opportunity to call its fundamental\npresuppositions into question, even if stubbornly Eurocentric\nphilosophers fail to heed this crucial calling of their discipline.\nUnfortunately, the world of politics tends to be a far less\nself-critical and thus less genuinely dialogical forum of\nintercultural relations. The history of Western imperial domination of\nAsia is well documented (see Panikkar 1969), and post-colonial\ncritique of Western imperialism plays a prominent role in contemporary\nacademia. At the same time, in the field of East Asian studies, Kyoto\nSchool thinkers are frequently accused of contributing to the\npolitical ideology of Japanese imperialism in the 1930s and early\n1940s. However, we need to carefully examine the sense in which and\nthe extent to which the political thought of the Kyoto School is\ndeserving of its tainted reputation in this regard.\n",
