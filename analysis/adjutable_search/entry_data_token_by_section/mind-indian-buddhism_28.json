    "main_text": "Mind and Epistemology || Epistemic Accounts of Perception\n7.3 Reflexive Awareness and Intentionality\n\n\nBuddhist authors are divided on the issue of the possibility of \nreflexive awareness (svasa\u1e43vedana). In general, \nphilosophers of the Dign\u0101ga-Dharmak\u012brti school accept the \nreality of reflexive awareness in the classical Yog\u0101c\u0101ra \nsense of self-luminosity (svaprak\u0101\u015ba) and support \ntheir arguments with the example of a lamp that illuminates itself \nwhile at the same time revealing other objects. However, this notion \nthat consciousness or cognitive awareness is inherently reflexive is \nrejected by M\u0101dhyamika authors such as Candrak\u012brti (ca. \n600\u2013650) and \u015a\u0101ntideva (fl. 8th century), who contend \nthat consciousness cannot be thought of as being inherently reflexive, even on a\nconventional level, since that would imply that consciousness is \nself-validating (see e.g., Madhyam\u0101kavat\u0101ra VI, \n74\u201375). Candrak\u012brti takes issue in particular with the \ncharacteristically Yog\u0101c\u0101ra view that the object of \ncognition is not extrinsic to cognition, but is an aspect of that \ncognition itself.\n\n\nBuddhist philosophers who take consciousness to be inherently reflexive are generally \nclassified in the doxographical literature as \nS\u0101k\u0101rav\u0101dins. Following \u015a\u0101ntarak\u1e63ita's\nOrnament of the Middle Way \n(Madhyamak\u0101la\u1e43k\u0101ra 11\u201392) five \nepistemological positions may be identified on the nature of \nconsciousness and the subject-object relation (see Kajiyama 1968; \n1978, 117\u2013132; Blumenthal 2004, 91 and passim): \n\n\n\ni\nSarv\u0101stiv\u0101da \ndharmas, external objects, and mental representations are real; \n\n\nii\nSautr\u0101ntika\nthe external world exists but it is imperceptible; physical objects \nexist only as a support for cognition, which can only apprehend mental representations;\n\n\niii\nSaty\u0101k\u0101rav\u0101da-Yog\u0101c\u0101ra\ncognition does not apprehend external objects but only perceptual and\n mental aspects, which are real modifications of the mental stream; cognition is inherently reflexive;\n\n\niv\nAl\u012bk\u0101k\u0101rav\u0101da-Yog\u0101c\u0101ra\nonly the reality of reflexive awareness can be ascertained; that \nof cognitive aspects resulting from modifications in the mental stream cannot;\n\n\nv\nMadhyamaka\nneither reflexive awareness, nor internal\n cognitive aspects, nor external objects can in any way be established\n as possessing their characteristics intrinsically; all dharmas lack\n inherent existence.\n\n\n\n\n\nIt suffices to mention that the epistemologists, who adopt an \nontological position that most closely aligns with the \nSautr\u0101ntikas, take consciousness to be inherently reflexive \nand describe it not with the aid of mirror \nmetaphors\u2014consciousness as a mirror reflecting back the nature of\nperceived phenomena\u2014but rather with plastic metaphors in which \nconsciousness is said to assume the form of whatever object it \ncognizes.\n\n\nIt is generally agreed that the main argument for reflexive awareness\nis offered by Dign\u0101ga. As we saw above, Dign\u0101ga, following \nVasubandhu, adopts a dual-aspect theory of cognition. Ultimately, \nthe adoption of this theory reflects his commitment to an internalist\nepistemology, which he develops at length in his Investigation of\nCognitive Support. But unlike his Brahmanical opponents \n(chiefly the Naiy\u0101yikas and the \nM\u012bm\u0101\u1e43s\u0101kas), Dign\u0101ga is also committed to \nthe view that the instruments or sources of knowledge themselves (the\npram\u0101\u1e47as) are not different from the ensuing\ncognitions (pram\u0101\u1e47a-phala). This view is\nmotivated, at least in part, by a radical and essential separation of\nperception from conception. For Dign\u0101ga, as for all Buddhist\nepistemologists, only perception can provide an empirical foundation\nand a neutral ground for ascertaining the nature of particulars\n(svalak\u1e63a\u1e47as).\n\n\nDign\u0101ga's views may be summarised as follows (after his \nCollection on Valid Cognition):\n\nThe phenomenal content of a perceptual event is just the\ninternal aspect (\u0101k\u0101ra) of that cognitive awareness\narising as the apprehension of external objects. The instrument or\nsource of cognition (pram\u0101\u1e47a), in this case\nperception, is not different from the object apprehended. Rather, as\nDign\u0101ga claims: \u201cthat which appears in cognition is the\nknown object (prameya), the reliable cognition\n(pram\u0101\u1e47a) and its result, are [respectively] the\nsubjective aspects [of the cognition] and the cognition\n[itself]\u201d (PS I, 10; Hattori 1968, 97).\nEach cognition arises having a double aspect: it appears as an\napprehending subject and as an apprehended objected. In terms of its\nappearance to itself, cognition manifests as self-awareness\n(svasa\u1e43vitti), which (as we saw above\nin \u00a77.1) is one of the four modes of cognitive\nawareness under the rubric of perception.\nThis subjective aspect of cognition\n(gr\u0101hak\u0101k\u0101ra) is just the individual's\nself-awareness as a cognizing agent, while the objective aspect\n(gr\u0101hy\u0101k\u0101ra) captures the intentional\ncharacter of cognition or its object-directedness. Thus, for\nDign\u0101ga, just as for Husserl, perception is ultimately constituted\nby intentional content. \nIn its double aspect as (i) evidential ground for knowledge and as\n(ii) as a direct means for the apprehension of objects, perception is\nultimately the only warranted type of cognitive awareness.\n\n\n\nThe epistemologists who follow Dign\u0101ga's account of \nperception thus agree that cognitive awareness is a self-revealing \ntype of cognition. As such it accompanies (by virtue of arising \ntogether with) each perceptual event. And perception, specifically \nany type of perception lacking conceptual elaboration \n(kalpan\u0101po\u1e0dha), is associated with knowledge of \nparticulars. It is precisely this aspect of Dign\u0101ga's theory of \nperception that is an object of criticism by M\u0101dhyamika \nphilosophers like Candrak\u012brti (see \nMadhyam\u0101kavat\u0101ra VI, 72\u201378), even if only \nindirectly: Candrak\u012brti's arguments target primarily the \nYog\u0101c\u0101ra doctrine of three natures. As explained in works \nsuch as Vasubandhu's Trisvabh\u0101vanirde\u015ba and \nMadhy\u0101ntavibh\u0101gabh\u0101\u1e63ya, the three \nnatures or forms of existence are:\n\n the imagined or the conceptualized\n(parikalpita)\u2014this stands for entities that appear as\nhaving physical properties and spatio-temporal extension, but in fact\nare just the products of imagination. \nthe dependent (paratantra)\u2014stands for things just\nas they are: the causal flow of the ultimate elements of existence\nand/or experience.\nthe ultimate or the perfected\n(parini\u1e63panna)\u2014this is understood relationally as\nthe absence of the first nature in the second nature: that is, as a\npure awareness of the causal flow of experience devoid of any\nconceptual elaborations. \n\n\n\nFor the Yog\u0101c\u0101ras all phenomena and all aspects of the \nmental domain can be subsumed under these there natures (cf. Nagao \n1991, 62 and passim). Similarly, Dign\u0101ga's \nunderstanding of direct perception \n(nirvikalpa-pratyak\u1e63a) as lacking any conceptual \nelaboration captures the sense of the perfected nature.\n\n\nAn axiomatic principle of all Madhyamaka philosophy, following \nN\u0101g\u0101rjuna's Foundation of the Middle Way, is that \nall things, including all cognitive episodes, by virtue of being the \nproduct of cause and conditions, lack inherent existence \n(svabh\u0101va) and are thus empty \n(\u015b\u016bnya). That is, nothing truly exits on its own, \nand no entity or mental state has its characteristics intrinsically. \nCandrak\u012brti's critique of reflexive awareness, then, targets \nthis notion that there is a class of cognitive events that are \nessentially self-characterizing: they reveal their own content \nwithout recourse to an additional instance of cognitive awareness. \nMore specifically, Candrak\u012brti rejects the notion that reflexive\nawareness has this unique property of giving access to the pure datum\nof experience (as Tillemans (1990: 49, n.109) observes, \nCandrak\u012brti does not seem to want to concede that there is a \ndifference between \u2018seeing\u2019 and \u2018seeing as,\u2019 \nand rests his criticism of reflexivity on the notion that all seeing \nis in effect seeing as).\n\n\nIt is precisely with the intention of answering critics like \nCandrak\u012brti that \u015a\u0101ntarak\u1e63ita identifies the \ncharacter of cognition as being contrary to insentient objects: \n\u201cCognitive awareness arises as something that is excluded from \nall insentient objects. This reflexive awareness of that cognition is\nnone other than its non-insentience\u201d \n(Tattvasa\u1e43graha 2000). In effect, \n\u015a\u0101ntarak\u1e63ita simply follows Dharmak\u012brti's \ncritique of the physicalist claim that consciousness arises from the \nfour elements. Dharmak\u012brti rejects the physicalist view on the \ngrounds that if the four elements, or a special transformation \nthereof, are the ultimate basis of consciousness, then consciousness \nought to arise whenever the elements occur, which is to say \neverywhere (see Praj\u00f1\u0101kagupta's PVBh ad II, 35; \nFranco 1997, 171f). Even if consciousness were said to arise at a \nparticular point in time, claims Dhamak\u012brti, it cannot arise \nfrom something that is not sentient.\n\n\nSimilarly, Dharmottara, as an innovative interpreter of \nepistemologists\u2019 account of the reflexive nature of awareness, \nclarifies the issue by invoking in his Commentary on \nDharmak\u012brti's Drop of Reasoning \n(Ny\u0101yabindu\u1e6dik\u0101; hereafter NB\u1e6c) the \nintentional character of cognition: what sets apart the occasioning \nof a cognitive event is that it accomplishes more that the causal \nprocess by which it arises allows for it\u2014that is, it \naccomplishes its goal by revealing the object as the pragmatic \noutcome of cognition (NB\u1e6c ad I, 1, 4.1). \nDharmottara contrasts the intentional character of cognitive \nawareness with merely causal accounts of generation, such as is the \ncase with seeds and sprouts: \u201cSprouts are not established [as \nthe result] though their production is invariably concomitant with \n[causes like] seeds. Thus, even though a cognition arises as \nestablishing a given object, it has the function of causing it to \narrive as [its object] necessarily, by means of which its goal is \naccomplished.\u201d (NB\u1e6c ad I, 19, 14.21). Elsewhere,\nDharmottara explains that the relation between cognition and object \ncognized is unlike that of elements in a causal chain, which exist as\nthe relation between producer and produced. Rather, it is like the \nrelation between the establishing factor and what it has established \n(vyavasth\u0101pravyavasth\u0101pakabh\u0101va), that is, \nbetween reflexive awareness and the intentional object as intended \n(NB\u1e6c ad I, 19, 15.3).\n\n\nFor the epistemologists, then, consciousness as reflexive \nawareness is not just another phenomenon in the chain of \ndependently arising phenomena: rather, it is precisely that which has\nthe unique function of disclosing itself in the process of revealing \nthe other. For as Dharmak\u012brti declares in the Ascertainment \nof Valid Cognition (PVin I, 55): \u201cIf ascertaining were not\nitself [directly] perceived, the perception of objects would not be \nestablished.\u201d\n\n\nThe Indian Buddhist account of reflexive awareness has also been\ninterpreted as corresponding to certain positions in Western\nphilosophy. Thus, Paul Williams (1998, 234f) notes that\n\u015a\u0101ntarak\u1e63ita's assertion of the unity of consciousness\nas reflexive awareness goes against the sort of reductive explanation\nof cognition that discriminates between agent, act, and object or\ncognizer, cognized, and cognizable. As such, it parallels Aristotle's\nview of reflexivity as found in De Anima and, more recently,\nthe views of Brentano and Sartre, who contend that to talk about\nconsciousness as lacking self-intimation effectively amounts to\naltogether denying the possibility of conscious awareness itself [for\na defense of the Madhyamaka critique of the notion of reflexive\nawareness, drawing primarily from the reception of this debate in\nTibet see Garfield 2006]. Similarly, Arnold (2005a, 88; 2005b, 78)\nproposes that the Indian philosophical debates concerning the nature\nof svasa\u1e43vedana, which he translates as apperception,\nparallel Kant's discussion of the transcendental unity of\napperception, and indeed post-Kantian debates on the precise meaning\nof this doctrine. Contrasting Dharmak\u012brti's views on reflexive\nawareness with Husserl's account of intentionality Dreyfus (2007, 109)\nargues for the notion that perception, at least in meditative states,\ndisplays something like a phenomenal type of intentionality. Recently,\nDign\u0101ga's understanding of reflexive awareness\nhas also been interpreted as being analogous to the notion of embodied\nself-awareness developed by Merleau-Ponty in his phenomenological\naccount of perception (see Coseru 2012). On this view, the intentional\ncharacter of reflexive awareness may be understood as corresponding to\nthe immediate sense of embodied agency that is characteristic of\ninternal states such as desire, pain, etc. \n",
