Stevenson\u2019s Legacy\n\nStevenson remains a central figure in current day metaethics, a result\nof his development of at least four key ideas:\n\nProgress in ethical theory begins by focusing in the first\ninstance on moral thought\u2014on what it is to think that\nsomething is good, bad, evil, etc.\nMoral thoughts are essentially constituted at least in part by\nattitudes or interests, that is, those feelings, attitudes, or other\naffective states that are most closely related to motivation and\naction, which can be generally characterized as states of being\nfor or being against.\nAttitudes or interests can be, and often are, rationally\ngovernable.\nMoral sentences have both emotive and descriptive meaning.\n\n\nThese four ideas remain central to current day expressivists, such as\nBlackburn (1984, 1993) and Gibbard (1990, 2003), whose work arises\nespecially from ideas 1\u20133. Indeed, the title of Gibbard 1990,\nWise Choices, Apt Feelings, suggests all three ideas. Current\nday hybrid theorists and relational expressivists,\nsuch as David Copp (2001, 2009), Stephen Barker (2002), Michael Ridge\n(2006, 2014), Daniel Boisvert (2008), and Teemu Toppinen (2013) hold\nthat moral language is used conventionally to express both beliefs and\nattitudes\u2014or states of being in some suitably related belief-\nand attitude states\u2014and, thereby, continue to develop in\ndifferent ways Stevenson\u2019s idea that moral sentences have both emotive\nand descriptive meaning (see also Schroeder 2009; 2013; Fletcher and\nRidge 2014; Toppinen 2018).\n",
