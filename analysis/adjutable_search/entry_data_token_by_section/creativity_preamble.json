    "main_text": "\n\nFew things shape the human experience as profoundly or as pervasively\nas creativity does. And creativity raises a wealth of philosophical\nissues. Since art is such a salient domain of creativity, you might\nassume, at first, that the philosophy of creativity is the philosophy\nof art or aesthetics, or a branch thereof. But creativity invites\nquestions of its own that go beyond the purview of those other\nfields.\n\nNote that the adjective \u201ccreative\u201d can be applied to three\nkinds of things: a person (\u201cBeyonc\u00e9 is\ncreative\u201d), a process or activity (\u201cTell us about\nyour creative process\u201d), or a product, where the latter\nis taken broadly to include an idea in someone\u2019s mind or an\nobservable performance or artifact (\u201cThat\u2019s a creative\ndesign\u201d).\n\nNow suppose you are looking at a creative product, like a painting or\nsculpture. The philosophy of art may ask, \u201cWhat makes this a\nwork of art?\u201d and aesthetics may ask, \u201cWhat makes this\nbeautiful?\u201d. By contrast, the philosophy of creativity asks,\n\u201cWhat makes this creative? Is it just that it\u2019s new, or\nmust it meet further conditions?\u201d We may ask the same question\nnot just of artworks but of any creative product, whether it\nbe a new scientific theory, a technological invention, a philosophical\nbreakthrough, or a novel solution to a mathematical or logical puzzle.\nBeyond creative products, we can ask about the creative\nprocess: Must it proceed without following rules? Is it\nconscious, unconscious, or both? Must it be an expression of the\ncreator\u2019s agency, and, if so, must that agency be exercised\nintentionally? Exactly how does the process manage to produce new\nthings? Can it be explained scientifically? Furthermore, we can ask\nabout creative persons, or more generally, creators.\nWhat does it mean for a person to be creative? Is it a virtue to be\ncreative? What capacities and characteristics does a being need to\nhave in order to be creative? Could a computer be creative? These are\nthe kinds of questions animating the literature we\u2019ll survey\nbelow.\n\nSome of these questions have an empirical dimension, most obviously\nthose which pertain to how the creative process is actually carried\nout. Thus, much of the research we\u2019ll canvass falls under the\ninter-disciplinary umbrella of cognitive science, with contributions\nnot only from philosophers but also from researchers in neighboring\nfields like psychology, neuroscience, and computer science.\n",
