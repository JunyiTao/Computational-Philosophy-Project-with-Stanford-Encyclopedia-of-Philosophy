    "main_text": "Life and Work || Meinong\u2019s Life and Work\n1.2 Meinong\u2019s Life and Work\n\nMeinong\u2019s father was an Austrian Major General whose ancestors\ncame from southwestern Germany (Handschuchsheim, near Heidelberg).\nMeinong repeatedly stressed that he was German, and he also joined\npolitical organizations of German nationalists. On the other hand, he\nwas a loyal Austrian and emphasized his distance from extreme,\nPan-Germanist groups like those that had taken up the ideas of Georg\nvon Sch\u00f6nerer.\n\nMeinong showed a strong inclination to music, practically as well as\ntheoretically. He performed chamber music in a proficient way (the\npiano and especially the violin), was an amateur composer (mainly of\nLieder) and took an interest in theoretical questions\nconcerning music (for example, he was engaged in discussions with\nGuido Adler, Christian von Ehrenfels, Stephan Witasek, and Joseph\nMarx, and he wrote reviews of Carl Stumpf\u2019s\nTonpsychologie, Vol. I and II).\n\nMeinong suffered from an inherited semi-blindness, a handicap that he\nalways tried to conceal, but which was already a hindrance in his\nearly years and deteriorated to almost complete blindness in the\ncourse of his life. Eventually, he needed people like his wife to read\nto him. So it was rather difficult for him to become acquainted with\nthe literature of his time. In spite of such unfavorable circumstances\nand although Meinong rather shunned social, political and cultural\nexposure (including the giving of public lectures and participation in\nconferences), he was still able to exert considerable influence on the\nacademic community of his time. Meinong\u2019s great achievements\nwere due in part to his ambition and perseverance, combined with\ndiligence and a disciplined way of working. To a considerable extent\nMeinong\u2019s accomplishments were facilitated by a well-organized\nfamily life for which his wife Doris bears much of the responsibility\nand credit. Meinong is a paradigmatic example of a bourgeois academic\nscholar \u2014 of an \u201cOrdinarius\u201d \u2014 around the turn\nof the century.\n\nLife-time friendships begun in Meinong\u2019s Viennese academic\nperiod included those with the musicologist Guido Adler and the\nphilosophers (also his pupils) Christian von Ehrenfels, Alois\nH\u00f6fler, and Anton von Oelzelt-Newin. During the time of his\nprofessorship in Graz he also became the teacher of, among others,\nEduard Martinak, Stephan Witasek, Anton Faist, Rudolf Ameseder,\nVittorio Benussi, Ernst Mally, Joseph Marx, Franz Weber, Ferdinand\nWeinhandl, and Fritz Heider.\n\nAlthough Meinong was a Roman Catholic, his early work already showed a\ncritical and distanced attitude towards the Catholic Church. Like\nArnold of Brescia, Meinong advocated the separation of religious and\nsecular affairs as well as the idea of the political equality of all\ndenominations. Furthermore, Meinong criticized the religious education\nin Austria\u2019s \u201cMittelschulen\u201d [high schools]\nas inadequate, since he considered it to be a restriction on freedom\nof opinion. Meinong suggested that historians (and not priests) should\ninstead teach the history of the development of religions and the\nvarious ways of satisfying religious needs.\n\nHis early essays, the \u201cHume Studies\u201d, I (1877) and II\n(1882) \u2014 his only investigations with an explicit historical\norientation \u2014 are, as the subtitles foreshadow, nonetheless\ncritical and systematic treatises. Written under the influence of his\nViennese mentor Franz Brentano, they show Meinong\u2019s tendency\ntowards British Empiricism (rather than Kantianism and German\nIdealism) and became relevant in the development of his object\ntheory.\n\nL Meinong\u2019s first book On Philosophical Science and its\nPropaedeutics (1885) plays a pivotal role for the understanding\nof Meinong\u2019s research as well as his teaching activities.\nOriginally, this book was written with the intention to criticize\ninstructions issued by the Ministry of Culture and Instruction to cut\ndown the hours of high school teaching in Philosophical Propaedeutics\n[philosophisch-prop\u00e4deutischer Unterricht], i.e.,\npsychology, logic and philosophy. But the book can also be read as a\nprogrammatic essay on Meinong\u2019s own views on philosophy and\npsychology. He makes it clear that philosophy can be done in a\nscientific rather than in a speculative manner, and he considers\npsychology as a fundamental subdiscipline of philosophy. Teaching\npsychology and philosophy cannot consist in the attempt to present\nfinished results or accepted theories; it has to be done by performing\nexperiments and engaging in discussion, respectively. Uncertainty in\nthe domain of knowledge is not to be considered as an obstacle, but\nrather as a didactically fertile challenge and an opportunity for\nmaking progress. Because of this practically-oriented view of\nphilosophy and science, Meinong proposed the establishment of both a\nPsychological Laboratory and a Philosophical Seminar as university\ninstitutions in Graz. As an academic philosopher he made it his duty\nto find extra time to discuss philosophical matters with his students,\nfriends, and colleagues.\n\nIn his Psychological-Ethical Investigations in Value\nTheory (1894), Meinong discussed the subjectivist economic value\ntheories of the Austrian economists Carl Menger and Friedrich von\nWieser. He took over, in principle, their subjectivist approach, but\nhe criticized and modified their theory of marginal utility in certain\nways. On the one hand, he extended it to values in general, over and\nabove mere economic values, on the other hand, he applied it to other\naxiological domains, especially to ethics. He also developed in detail\nhis idea that ethics was entirely determined by the\nvalue\u2013disvalue [Wert\u2013Unwert]\ndistinction. Beginning with his paper from 1912 \u201cF\u00fcr die\nPsychologie ...\u201d and then with On Emotional\nPresentation (1917) and other later works on value theory (1921;\n1923), Meinong took an objectivist point of view and combined the\npsychological analysis of values with his theory of objects. Values\nand norms (\u201coughts\u201d, [Sollen]) are to be seen as\nspecial kinds of objects, and there are not only personal values but\nalso impersonal ones.\n\nMeinong\u2019s psychological works are more concerned with the\nmethodology of psychology and with what Brentano called\n\u201cdescriptive psychology\u201d \u2014 a kind of classification\nor taking of an inventory of the mental furniture \u2014 than with\n\u201cgenetic psychology\u201d, i.e., the experiment-based, causal\ntheory of mental (and physiological) occurrences (cf. Antonelli 2018:\n3\u2013100). Stimulated by Twardowski (1894) but also in critical\ndistance to this treatise, Meinong combined descriptive-psychological\nmatters with epistemological and ontological themes in his essay\n\u201cOn Objects of Higher Order and Their Relationship to Internal\nPerception\u201d (1899).\n\nMeinong\u2019s mature epistemological views, which are both\nanti-skeptical and fallibilistic, are to be found in his 1906, 1910,\nand 1915. He propagated a theory of evidence as the basis of\njustification partly similar to Brentano\u2019s (as far as the\n\u201cdirect\u2013indirect\u201d and \u201ca\npriori\u2013a posteriori\u201d distinctions are\nconcerned), partly in sharp contrast to it, because already in 1886\nMeinong added the \u201cevidence for presumption\u201d\n[Vermutungsevidenz] to the \u201cevidence for\ncertainty\u201d, something of which Brentano strongly\ndisapproved.\n\nIn his later works (1902; 1904b; 1906; 1907; 1910; 1915; 1917; 1918)\nthe various aforementioned philosophical disciplines are intertwined,\nonly the emphasis of the subject matters differs. Although the topics\nof the monographs seem to be narrowly demarcated (On\nAssumptions (1902, 1910); On Possibility and Probability\n(1915); On Emotional Presentation (1917)), Meinong deals with\na broad range of subjects so that one can make out the development of\na complete system of philosophy. A work of a more general character is\n\u201cThe Theory of Objects\u201d (1904b), a kind of manifesto,\nwhich was continued by the apologetic and also programmatic book\nOn the Place of the Theory of Objects in the System of\nSciences (1907).\n\nIn 1918, Meinong published his last major work \u2014 an attempt at\nproving the law of universal causation, i.e. the principle that\nassures the unexceptional causal determination of all occurrences\n(states, events). He provides two arguments in favor of this\nprinciple. First, he argues, following Hobbes and Brentano, that\nuncaused events turn out to be infinitely improbable. Second, Meinong\nuses an a priori proof of his own which claims that\nexceptionless determinacy is necessary as no occurrence can be without\na state of affairs that Meinong calls its \u201cimplicans\u201d\n(1918: 45\u201366; cf. Hartmann 1920). Meinong not only supports\ndeterminism, he also defends compatibilism because determinism, and\nnot indeterminism, allows us to ascribe responsibility (for being\nguilty, or meritorious etc.) to persons (1894, \u00a768; 1918: 92:\n\u201cFreedom is not indeterminacy, and determinacy is not compulsion\nor coercion\u201d).\n\nNear the end of his life he wrote the short and yet comprehensive\nintellectual autobiography \u201cA. Meinong\u201d (1921a). Further\nbiographical information is provided in D\u00f6lling 1999, the first\nbiographical monograph on Meinong, and in D\u00f6lling 2001, Eder\n1995, Kindinger 1965, Lindenfeld 1980 (Chapt. III), Raspa 2016.\n",
