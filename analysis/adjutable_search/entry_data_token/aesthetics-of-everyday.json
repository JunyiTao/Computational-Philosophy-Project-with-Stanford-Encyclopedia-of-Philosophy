However, beginning with the nineteenth\ncentury, the discourse has become increasingly focused on the fine\narts. This narrowing attention occurred despite the prominence of the\naesthetic attitude theory in modern aesthetics, according to which\nthere is virtually no limit to what can become a source of aesthetic\nexperience. The tendency to equate aesthetics with the philosophy of\nart became widespread in twentieth century aesthetics, particularly\nwithin the Anglo-American tradition.\n\nChallenges to this rather limited scope of aesthetics began during the\nlatter half of the twentieth century with a renewed interest in nature\nand environment, followed by the exploration of popular arts. Everyday\naesthetics continues this trajectory of widening scope by including\nobjects, events, and activities that constitute people\u2019s daily\nlife. However, it is more accurate to characterize this recent\ndevelopment as restoring the scope of aesthetics rather than\nopening a new arena.\n\nIn addition, many cultural traditions outside the Western sphere have\nlong been concerned with the aesthetics of daily life. In some\ncultural traditions, such as Inuit and Navajo, aesthetic\nconsiderations are thoroughly integrated in daily activities,\nincluding making things such as tools (Papanek 1995; Witherspoon\n1996). Even in other traditions, such as Japanese and Chinese, with\ndistinctive art-making practices of paintings, literature, theater,\nand the like, aesthetic practices permeate people\u2019s daily life.\nOne of the findings of comparative aesthetics is that a greater\nemphasis is placed on the aesthetics of everyday life in many\nnon-Western cultures than in the West (Higgins 2005).\n\nThus, the perception that everyday aesthetics is a new frontier of\naesthetics discourse needs to be situated in the context of late\ntwentieth-century Anglo-American aesthetics. That is, it was\nestablished as a reaction against what was considered to be an undue\nrestriction on the scope of aesthetics. It aims to give due regard to\nthe entirety of people\u2019s multi-faceted aesthetic life, including\nvarious ingredients of everyday life: artifacts of daily use, chores\naround the house, interactions with other people, and quotidian\nactivities such as eating, walking, and bathing. Everyday aesthetics\nalso seeks to liberate aesthetic inquiry from an almost exclusive\nfocus on beauty (and to a certain extent sublimity) characteristic of\nmodern Western aesthetics. It includes within its purview those\nqualities that pervade everyday experience, such as pretty, cute,\nmessy, gaudy, tasteful, dirty, lively, monotonous, to name only a few.\nThese items and qualities are characterized by their ubiquitous\npresence in the daily life of people, regardless of their identity,\noccupation, lifestyle, economic status, social class, cultural\nbackground, and familiarity with art.\n\nBeyond attending to more items and qualities for its inquiry, everyday\naesthetics also raises theoretical issues that have not received\nadequate attention from the prevailing mainstream Western aesthetics.\nThese include: indeterminate identity of the object of aesthetic\nexperience due to a lack of an institutionally agreed-upon framing;\nchanges and modifications everyday objects go through; general\nanonymity of the designer and creator, as well as absence of any clear\nauthorship behind everyday objects; bodily engagements with objects\nand activities and their pragmatic outcome; perceived lack of criteria\nfor aesthetic judgments. By raising these issues, everyday aesthetics\nchallenges long-held assumptions underlying art-centered aesthetics\ndiscourse. However, everyday aesthetics advocates pose these\nchallenges not as a way of invalidating the established aesthetics\ndiscourse. Rather, they are meant to shed new light on the prevailing\ndiscourse. Just as new forms of art often introduce qualities and\nvalues that were not considered before and enrich the artworld, as\nsuggested by Arthur Danto, everyday aesthetics proposes to help\ndevelop the overall aesthetics discourse by adding new avenues of\ninquiry. Accordingly, the account of everyday aesthetics that follows\nwill focus on these issues that have been raised to illuminate and\nchallenge the prevailing aesthetics discourse in contemporary Western\nphilosophy.\n", "toc": [{"#RecHis": "1.

Recent History\n\nWith the establishment of environmental aesthetics, efforts to open\nthe field of aesthetics beyond the fine arts started during the latter\nhalf of twentieth century. Almost all writers on everyday aesthetics\nderive inspiration from John Dewey\u2019s Art as Experience,\nfirst published in 1934. In particular, his discussion of\n\u201chaving an experience\u201d demonstrates that\naesthetic experience is possible in every aspect of people\u2019s\ndaily life, ranging from eating a meal or solving a math problem to\nhaving a job interview. By locating \u2018the aesthetic\u2019 in the\ncharacter of an experience rather than in a specific kind of object or\nsituation, Dewey paves the way for everyday aesthetics advocates to\nexplore diverse aspects of people\u2019s aesthetic lives without a\npre-configured boundary.\n\nIf Dewey\u2019s aesthetics can be considered as the classic for\neveryday aesthetics discourse, Arnold Berleant\u2019s early works on\naesthetic field and engagement continue the trajectory. Despite\nfocusing on the experience of art and without specifically referring\nto the term \u2018everyday aesthetics,\u2019 Berleant\u2019s early\nworks provide a phenomenological account of aesthetic experience by\nemphasizing the interactive process between the experiencing agent and\nthe object of experience. This notion of \u2018engagement\u2019 as a\nmodel for aesthetics is applicable to one\u2019s experience beyond\nart. Indeed, his subsequent works on environmental aesthetics, both\nnatural and built, and more recently on social aesthetics and negative\naesthetics, have been consistently opening the scope of aesthetic\ninquiry.\n\nBesides works on environmental aesthetics that addresses built\nenvironments (see the entry on \n environmental aesthetics), \n other notable\nearly works specifically addressing issues of everyday aesthetics\ninclude Melvin Rader and Bertram Jessup\u2019s Art and Human\nValues (1976), Joseph Kupfer\u2019s Experience as Art:\nAesthetics in Everyday Life (1983), David Novitz\u2019s The\nBoundaries of Art: A Philosophical Inquiry into the Place of Art in\nEveryday Life (1992), Thomas Leddy\u2019s \u201cEveryday\nSurface Aesthetic Qualities: \u2018Neat,\u2019 \u2018Messy,\u2019\n\u2018Clean,\u2019 \u2018Dirty\u2019\u201d (1995) and\n\u201cSparkle and Shine\u201d (1997), Wolfgang Welsch\u2019s\nUndoing Aesthetics (1997), Ossi Naukkarinen\u2019s\nAesthetics of the Unavoidable: Aesthetic Variations in Human\nAppearance (1999), and Marcia Eaton\u2019s Aesthetics and\nthe Good Life (1989) and Merit, Aesthetic and Ethical\n(2001).\n\nThe first anthology on this topic, The Aesthetics of Everyday\nLife, edited by Andrew Light and Jonathan M. Smith, published in\n2005, includes many articles that together lay the groundwork for more\nrecent literature on everyday aesthetics. Often cited among them are\nArto Haapala\u2019s \u201cOn the Aesthetics of the Everyday:\nFamiliarity, Strangeness, and the Meaning of Place\u201d and Tom\nLeddy\u2019s \u201cThe Nature of Everyday Aesthetics.\u201d \n\nThe first monograph with the specific title Everyday\nAesthetics, accompanied by the subtitle Prosaics, the Play of\nCulture and Social Identities, was written by Katya Mandoki and\npublished in 2007. She offers an extensive critique of the prevailing\nWestern aesthetics discourse burdened by what she characterizes as\n\u201cfetishes\u201d regarding art and beauty, as well as a detailed\nsemiotic analysis of aesthetics involved in areas ranging from\nreligion and education to family and medicine. Almost immediately\nafter the publication of Mandoki\u2019s book, Yuriko Saito\u2019s\nEveryday Aesthetics was published. These works were followed\nby Thomas Leddy\u2019s The Extraordinary in the Ordinary: The\nAesthetics of Everyday Life (2012). They together secured the\ninitial foothold for the subsequent development of everyday\naesthetics.\n\nParalleling these early works are monographs and anthologies dedicated\nto specific aspects of daily life, such as gustatory aesthetics\n(Korsmeyer 1999, 2005; Perullo 2016; van der Meulen and Wiese 2017),\ndomestic aesthetics (McCracken 2001), body aesthetics (Shusterman\n1999, 2013; Bhatt 2013; Irvin 2016), functional beauty (Parsons and\nCarlson 2008), the aesthetics of design (Forsey 2013), and olfactory\naesthetics (Drobnick 2005; Shiner forthcoming), as well as a\ncollection of essays dealing with the notion of\n\u201cartification\u201d in practices ranging from business and\neducation to science and sports (Naukkarinen and Saito, 2012).\n\nAll of these works together have given rise to an increasingly lively\ndebate on the subject in journals such as Aisthesis, The\nBritish Journal of Aesthetics , Contemporary Aesthetics,\nEspes, The Journal of Aesthetics and Art Criticism,\nThe Nordic Journal of Aesthetics, Proceedings of the\nEuropean Society for Aesthetics, and Studi di Estetica\n(Italian Journal of Aethetics), to name only a few that feature\nor include articles in English. In addition, more anthologies on\neveryday aesthetics have been published recently, namely the \nAisthesis volume dedicated to the subject of Everyday Objects\n(2014), Experiencing the Everyday (Friberg and Vasquez 2017),\nand Paths from the Philosophy of Art to Everyday Aesthetics\n(Kuisma, et al. 2019). These anthologies and journals are particularly\nhelpful to those Anglophone readers who lack the language facility to\naccess many European aestheticians\u2019 works, some monographs, that\nare written in their own languages. Among them are Gioia Iannilli,\nGiovanni Matteucci, Dan Eugen Ratiu, and Elisabetta di Stefano. Their\nEnglish language articles included in these anthologies and journals\nare valuable in making their important works available to Anglophone\nreaders.\n\nAs was the case with her Everyday Aesthetics, Saito\u2019s\nrecent monograph, Aesthetics of the Familiar: Everyday Life and\nWorld-Making (2017a) includes extensive discussion of Japanese\naesthetics. However, the first explicitly and specifically\nmulti-cultural exploration of everyday aesthetics appeared in the form\nof an anthology, Aesthetics of Everyday Life: East and West\n(2014), edited by Liu Yuedi and Curtis Carter, with a number of pieces\non Chinese aesthetics. Similar to the case of European languages, most\nAnglophone readers lack the language ability to access many works on\nChinese aesthetics written in Chinese. English language papers\nincluded in this anthology and other journal articles by scholars\nprovide a good entry into a rich legacy of living aesthetics in the\nChinese tradition that is garnering a renewed attention today.\nFinally, although not specifically dedicated to everyday aesthetics,\nmany essays collected in the Special Volume 3 of Contemporary\nAesthetics (2011) on Aesthetics and the Arts of Southeast Asia,\nthe same journal\u2019s Special Volume 6 (2018) on Aesthetic\nConsciousness in East Asia, and Artistic Visions and the Promise\nof Beauty: Cross Cultural Perspectives (Higgins, et al 2017)\nprovide valuable resources for non-Western aesthetics.\n2. \u2018Everyday\u2019 and \u2018Aesthetics\u2019 in Everyday Aesthetics\n\nBecause everyday aesthetics was initially proposed as a way of\novercoming modern Western aesthetics\u2019 limitation on what\ncomprises people\u2019s aesthetic life as its subject matter, its\nscope has not been clearly defined except as including what has not\nbeen covered by art-centered aesthetics. With the development of this\ndiscourse, however, questions emerged as to what constitutes\n\u2018everyday\u2019 and \u2018aesthetics\u2019 in everyday\naesthetics. Inclusion of not only daily activities like eating,\ngrooming, dressing, and cleaning but also occasional and even rare\nevents such as parties, sporting events, holidays, weddings, and\ntravelling calls into question whether \u2018everyday\u2019 should\nbe understood literally. \n\nFurthermore, what may count as an everyday activity for one person may\nbe a special occasion for other people. Working on a farm constitutes\na farmer\u2019s everyday life, while it is a rare experience sought\nby a city dweller who participates in a tour that incorporates work\nexperience, such as a day working in a vineyard. Besides\npeople\u2019s occupation and lifestyle, diverse living environments\ndetermine what is included in their everyday life. For those residents\nin a densely populated urban area with a developed network of public\ntransportation, as well as for those living in different parts of the\nworld, riding in a car may be a rare occasion, while it is a daily\nroutine for many living in typical American suburbs. Finally, some\npeople\u2019s daily lives consist of constant travels, as in the case\nof a famed conductor, Valery Gergiev (Puolakka 2019).\n\nThe notion of \u2018everyday\u2019 thus becomes hopelessly unwieldy,\nand it is impossible to come up with a list of objects and activities\nthat belong to it. However, one could point to some core activities\nand objects that transcend individual and cultural differences, such\nas eating, dressing, grooming, shelter, and basic utilitarian objects,\nsuch as clothing, furniture, and eating implements (Melchionne 2013).\nThe most important factor for the purpose of everyday aesthetics,\nhowever, is not so much an inventory of objects and activities but\nrather the typical attitude we take toward them. We tend to experience\nthese objects and activities mostly with practical considerations that\neclipse their aesthetic potentials (Bullough 1912\u201313; Stolnitz\n1969; Ziff 1997). These experiences are generally regarded as\nordinary, commonplace, and routine. Such characterization may be the\nbest way to capture \u2018everyday,\u2019 allowing diverse\noccupations, lifestyles, and living environments that give rise to\ndifferent ingredients of everyday life. \n\nMany advocates of everyday aesthetics, however, also include rare,\nstandout, and more artistically-charged occasions in its scope. For\nexample, a holiday celebration is laden with all kinds of aesthetic\nconsiderations, ranging from interior and exterior decorations to\nspecial dishes, a carefully-arranged table setting and festive music.\nMany of us specifically attend to these aesthetic aspects both as\nproviders and as receivers, giving aesthetics a predominant role in\nthese experiences. In light of these different kinds of experiences,\nsome suggest allowing gradation among various objects and activities,\nwith one end designating the most quotidian objects and activities\nthat are experienced primarily with a practical mindset, and the other\nend those occasions standing out from daily life and marked by much\nmore conscious attention to the aesthetic dimension, rendering the\nexperience more like art appreciation (Naukkarinen 2013; Leddy\n2015).\n\nThus, recent discussion of the notion of everyday emphasizes\nrelationality and lability, a temporary framework that responds to\nspecific time and place, whether it regards the course of an\nindividual\u2019s life (such as a painting becoming a part of\none\u2019s everyday life after being purchased and hung on the living\nroom wall), or a general societal change, such as the increasing\npresence of the digital world today. Accordingly, the distinction\nbetween ordinary/extraordinary, familiar/unfamiliar, and\nevent-like/routine-like that dominate the discussion of everyday\nshould not be understood as something stationary, static, and fixed\n(Haapala 2017; Potgieter 2017).\n\nDebates surrounding what constitutes \u2018aesthetics\u2019 in\neveryday aesthetics are not unique to this discourse. The nature of\naesthetics has been a perennial point of contention in aesthetics at\nlarge, whether regarding fine arts, nature, popular culture or\neveryday objects and activities (see in particular the entries on the\nConcept of the Aesthetic and Dewey\u2019s Aesthetics). However, there\nare at least two points of particular interest and significance\nregarding the notion of \u2018aesthetics\u2019 in everyday\naesthetics. First is the status of bodily sensations. They can be felt\nby us as we receive sensory stimulation such as the wafting smell of\nbaked goods, the sensation of silk against our skin, the taste of\nsushi, or the feeling of massage. They can also result from bodily\nactivities, such as running, chopping vegetables, using tools, or\nmowing the lawn. The debate regarding whether or not these bodily\nsensations belong to the realm of aesthetics proper is not new. The\nbest-known classical treatment of this issue is Immanuel Kant\u2019s\ndistinction between the beautiful and the agreeable or the pleasant.\nMany contemporary art projects also give rise to this discussion\nthrough the creation of olfactory art, art happenings that include\ncooking and eating, and participatory art that requires the\naudience\u2019s bodily engagement. However, the issue becomes more\nacute with everyday aesthetics because our daily experience is\npermeated by sensory experiences and bodily activities (see Sections 7\nand 8 for further discussion).\n\nAnother important issue regarding the term \u2018aesthetics\u2019 in\neveryday aesthetics is the distinction between its honorific and\nclassificatory use. In both aesthetics discourse and common\nvernacular, the term \u2018aesthetic\u2019 is generally used in the\nhonorific sense. Hence, something having an aesthetic property is\ngenerally regarded positively and gaining an aesthetic experience is\nunderstood to mean that it is a meaningful and satisfying experience.\nHowever, increasing number of everyday aestheticians return to the\nroot meaning of \u2018aesthetic\u2019 as sensory perception gained\nwith sensibility and imagination, whatever its evaluative valence may\nbe. Some things strike us with powerful positive aesthetic values, as\nin a great work of art or a spectacular landscape, while other things\ndo not affect us much because they are boring, non-descript, or plain.\nThen there are those objects and phenomena that offend or disturb us\nprofoundly because their sensuous appearance is hideous, monstrous, or\nappalling, without any overall redeeming value such as an artistic\nmessage. Everyday aesthetics casts a wide net for capturing these\ndiverse dimensions of our aesthetic life. It is noteworthy that in\nacademic discourses outside of philosophical aesthetics,\n\u2018aesthetics\u2019 is often regarded in the classificatory\nsense, such as the aesthetics of manners, which includes both polite\nand rude behaviors, and the aesthetics of politics which, among other\nthings, refers to the social and political construction of what counts\nas the sensible (Mandoki 2007; Ranci\u00e8re 2009; Vihalem\n2018).\n\nSome recent writers propose that everyday aesthetics will be better\nserved by characterizing the aesthetic as a specific mode of\nperception. Everyday aestheticians who emphasize the difference of\neveryday aesthetic experience from a typical experience of art tend to\ncharacterize the former\u2019s passivity and minimize the mediation\nof various conceptual considerations, emotional involvement, and\nimaginative engagement typically required in experiencing art. While\nit is agreed that the aesthetic is based upon our sensory perception,\nwithout a more active, creative, and imaginative involvement, those\ncritics point out, there is nothing distinctly aesthetic about mere\nsensations. One suggested solution is to characterize an aesthetic\nexperience as a dynamic and dialectic process of sensory perception\nand reflectivity that form aisthesis which leads to a\ndialogical relationship with the object we are perceiving (Matteucci\n2017). This more general theory of aesthetic perception will help\novercome the aforementioned two issues everyday aestheticians were\ngrappling with, namely inclusion of all sensory modes and rendering\nthe term valence-neutral. As will be discussed later in Section 8, one\nof the issues everyday aesthetics needs to determine is whether it\ncarves out an independent arena of aesthetics or it is rather a\ncontinuation of aesthetics that had been established with art as the\nprimary model. Those who advocate the continuity model argue that the\ndialogical mode of perception that integrates reflectivity provides\nthe specifically aesthetic character to everyday experience (Nielsen\n2005; Mateucci 2017; Potgieter 2017).\n3. Defamiliarization of the Familiar\n\nIf \u2018everyday\u2019 is characterized as the familiar, ordinary,\ncommonplace, and routine, regardless of the specific content that\nvaries from people to people depending upon their lifestyle,\noccupation, living environment, and other factors, what makes its\naesthetic appreciation possible? The following response dominates\neveryday aesthetics discourse: the aesthetic appreciation of everyday\nlife requires defamiliarization, making strange, or casting an aura.\nBecause we are most of the time preoccupied by the task at hand in our\ndaily life, practical considerations mask the aesthetic potential of\ncommonplace objects and ordinary activities. Furthermore, such\nexperiences lack any coherent structure consisting of unity, pervasive\ncharacter, and a clear beginning and an end. In short, according to\nDewey, our everyday humdrum proceeds mechanically without any internal\norganic evolution, hence \u201canesthetic.\u201d Only when we have\nan experience with all the structural requirements fulfilled\ndoes our everyday life gain aesthetic merit. Once we have an\nexperience with a different attitude and perceptual gear and/or a\ncohesive internal structure, we can unearth latent aesthetic values in\nthe most ordinary and routine. This view can be interpreted as a\nfaithful application of the claim made by the aesthetic attitude\ntheory that theoretically anything can be an object of aesthetic\nexperience. Mundane objects can acquire a kind of \u2018aura\u2019\nthat heightens their aesthetic value (Leonhardt 1985; Tuan 1993;\nVisser 1997; Gumbrecht 2006; Leddy 2008, 2012a; Al Qudowa 2017).\nAccording to this interpretation, what is new about everyday\naesthetics is its illumination of those aspects of our lives that are\nnormally neglected or ignored because they are eclipsed by standout\naesthetic experiences we often have with works of art and nature. More\ncareful attention and a different mindset can reveal a surprisingly\nrich aesthetic dimension of the otherwise mundane, non-memorable,\nordinary parts of our daily life. Many works of art are helpful in\nguiding us through the morasses of everyday life toward a rewarding\naesthetic experience (Dillard 1974; Prose 1999; Stabb 2002; Martin\n2004, Leddy 2012a; Nanay 2016, 2018). This trajectory of everyday\naesthetics is welcomed by a number of thinkers for its contribution to\nenriching life experiences, encouraging mindful living, and\nfacilitating happiness without problematic consequences that often\naccompany a hedonistic lifestyle (Irvin 2008b; Shusterman 2013;\nMelchionne 2014; Leddy 2014b).\n\nAt the same time, some point out the danger of over-emphasizing\ndefamiliarization as a precondition for everyday aesthetics. That is,\nthis way of accounting for everyday aesthetics risks losing the very\neveryday-ness of everyday experience, thereby becoming unable to\ncapture the aesthetic texture of everyday life characterized by its\nfamiliar, ordinary, and mundane quality (Felski 2002, 2009; Highmore\n2004, 2011a; Haapala 2005; Saito 2017a). The challenge then becomes\nhow to capture the very ordinary everyday-ness of everyday life while\nengaging aesthetically. That is, experiencing and appreciating the\nordinary as extraordinary follows a rather well-trodden path in\naesthetics discourse, while experiencing and appreciating the ordinary\nas ordinary poses a specific challenge to everyday aesthetics\ndiscourse.\n\nSeveral responses have been given to account for the aesthetics of the\nordinary as ordinary. One proposed response is to regard qualities\nsuch as the familiar and the ordinary as positively appreciable as a\ncounterpart to those qualities that make some experiences stand out\nfor being intense and extraordinary. Though not stunning or intense,\nthose qualities characterizing ordinary life provide a quiet calm,\ncomfort, stability, and security to our life experience (Haapala\n2005). It is difficult to imagine how we can handle, let alone enjoy,\na constant series of extraordinary, intense experiences with no\nrestful period. Many aspects of domestic life instead offer comfort,\nstability, and respite, in short hominess, because of the very\nordinary and repetitive nature, and such qualities are indispensable\nfor good life and appreciable in their own right (Highmore 2004,\n2011a; Irvin 2008b; Melchionne 2014).\n\nHowever, this response is challenged for failing to explain what is\ndistinctly aesthetic about the sense of comfort and stability. The\nvalue of these feelings, according to the critics, is rather\nexistentially-oriented and possibly relies on the instrumental role\nthey play in assuring a secure foundation for life. An alternative\nsolution to the dilemma proposed is to focus on the functional use of\nobjects of daily life that is not separate from our management and\nflow of daily life or the cultural context and knowledge required for\nits use. When an object functions particularly well, the pleasure we\ngain is still embedded in our daily life and does not render the\nexperience out of gear from the flow of everyday (Forsey 2014).\n\nThis move can also be characterized as a variation of\ncognitively-oriented aesthetics widely discussed in environmental\naesthetics regarding nature. Instead of natural sciences that inform\nthe aesthetic appreciation of nature, the suggestion is that everyday\naesthetic experience be informed by common sense knowledge about the\nobject\u2019s function, significance, and place in our lives that\nprovides the familiarity sought for in aesthetically experiencing the\nfamiliar as familiar (Carlson 2014).\n\nThese solutions address familiarity experienced as familiar as a\npositive value whether regarding hominess or excellent functionality.\nHowever, those who are concerned with developing the classificatory\nsense of aesthetics point out that the the lack of coherent structure,\nslackness, monotony, and humdrum that, according to Dewey, generate\nexperiences that are \u201canesthetic\u201d actually also\ncharacterize the aesthetic texture of everyday life (Highmore 2011a;\nMollar 2014; Saito 2017a). Deficiency in positive aesthetic qualities,\nsuch as exciting intensity, coherent narrative structure, or pervasive\nunifying theme, does not necessarily mean lack of aesthetic qualities.\nThose aspects of our lives can still be regarded as permeated by\naesthetic qualities, though negative, such as dreariness and painful\nmonotony. Such negative characterization of everyday life has often\nbeen the subject of Marxist interpretations of workers\u2019 daily\nlives, whether at work or at home, providing a platform for rebellious\nmovements, such as the Situationist International (Highmore 2010).\n4. Negative Aesthetics\n\nThis account of everyday life as pervaded by negative aesthetic\nqualities rather than lacking any aesthetic qualities gives rise to\n\u2018negative aesthetics.\u2019 This notion may at first appear to\nbe an oxymoron, if \u2018aesthetics\u2019 is understood in the usual\nhonorific sense. Katya Mandoki and Arnold Berleant stress the\nimportance of attending to this aesthetically negative aspect of\npeople\u2019s lives that is unfortunately all too common (Mandoki\n2007; Berleant 2010, 2012). Negative aesthetic qualities such as\nugliness, grotesqueness, repulsiveness, and disgust have not been\nabsent in the prevailing aesthetics discourse, but they don\u2019t\noccupy a prominent place (notable exceptions being Korsmeyer 2011,\nForsey 2016). Furthermore, more often than not, these negative\nqualities become justified as a necessary means to facilitating an\nultimately positive aesthetic experience. For example, a disgusting\ncontent of art may be necessary for conveying an overall message, such\nas an expos\u00e9 and critique of social ills, or a repulsive sight\nin nature, such as a predator devouring its prey, can be appreciated\nas an integral part of nature\u2019s process.\n\nNegative aesthetic qualities experienced as negative, in comparison,\nare unfortunately quite pervasive in everyday life and they directly\naffect the quality of life. They range from less noteworthy qualities\nsuch as the boring, the monotonous, the uninspiring, the banal, and\nthe dull to \u201caesthetic violence,\u201d \u201caesthetic\npain,\u201d \u201caesthetic poisoning,\u201d or \u201caesthetic\nassault,\u201d such as the hideous, the offensive, the repulsive, and\nthe vulgar (Mandoki 2007). These more dramatically negative qualities\ncan be experienced in a squalid urban space, deafening noise,\ncluttered billboard with gaudy signage and sordid visual images,\nstench from a nearby factory, and the like. In light of the fact that\naesthetics has tended to confine its scope to positive qualities and\nexperiences, everyday aesthetics challenges us to pay serious\nattention to the aesthetically negative aspects of our lives because\nof their immediate impact on the quality of life.\n\nThe focus on negative aesthetics is particularly important in everyday\naesthetics discourse because it leads to what may be regarded as its\nactivist dimension. When confronted with negative aesthetic qualities,\nwe generally don\u2019t remain a mere spectator but rather spring\ninto action to eliminate, reduce, or transform them. Even if we\ndon\u2019t or can\u2019t act, we wish we could do so and we think we\nshould. According to the prevailing mode of aesthetic analysis\nregarding art, and to a certain extent nature, our aesthetic life is\nprimarily characterized from a spectator\u2019s point of view. We are\nnot literally engaged in an activity with the object other than\naesthetic engagement. Even if we are inspired to act by art or nature,\nthe resultant action is generally indirect, such as joining a\npolitical movement or making a contribution to an organization.\n\nIn comparison, the action we undertake motivated by negative\naesthetics in daily life has a direct impact on life. On a personal\nlevel, we launder a stained shirt and iron it, clean the carpet soiled\nby spilled wine, repaint the living room wall, open a window to get\nfresh air after cooking fish indoors, tidy up the guest room, reformat\na document for a clearer look, and the list goes on (Forsey 2016;\nSaito 2017a). These actions are taken primarily in response to our\nnegative aesthetic reaction against stain, wrinkle, unpleasant color\nof the wall, fishy smell, mess and clutter, and disorganized look. On\na community level, eyesore-like abandoned structures get torn down or\ngiven a make-over, a squalid neighborhood gets cleaned up, and\nordinances are created to eliminate factory stench and cluttered\nbillboards. At least we often work, or believe we should work, toward\nimproving the aesthetics of everyday environment and life. Negative\naesthetic experiences are thus useful and necessary in detecting what\nis harmful to the quality of life and environment and provide an\nimpetus for improvement (Berleant 2012).\n5. Everyday Aesthetic Qualities\n\nHowever, questions can be raised as to whether qualities such as\nmessiness and clutter belong to aesthetics discourse. Appreciation of\nmore typical aesthetic qualities, such as beauty, sublimity, elegance,\ngrace, artistic excellence, powerful expression, and the like, is\nthought to require a certain degree of aesthetic sensibility or\n\u2018taste\u2019 that needs to be cultivated. Moreover, their\nappreciation often demands a certain conceptual understanding of\nthings, such as the object\u2019s historical and cultural context,\nthe artist\u2019s oeuvre, and some basic information regarding\nnature, among others. Aesthetic experience, after all, is expected to\npromote a dialogical process between the experiencing agent and the\nobject, thereby widening and deepening one\u2019s sensuous,\nemotional, imaginative, and intellectual capacity. Sometimes\ncharacterized as Bildung, it should be an educational and\nempowering experience.\n\nIn comparison, the detection of the everyday aesthetic qualities in\nquestion, such as messiness, shabbiness, cuteness, and prettiness,\nseems to result from an almost knee-jerk reaction without any\nbackground knowledge, aesthetic sophistication or reflective process,\nand, as such, does not make a worthy subject matter for\naesthetics.\n\nTwo responses have been given to this challenge. First, even if some\nqualities can be experienced without the same kind and degree of\naesthetic sensibility or sophistication required for art appreciation,\nthis alone does not render them outside the realm of aesthetics. Even\na seemingly unreflective response to qualities \u2013 such as dirty,\nmessy, and disorganized \u2013 is not free of a cultural and\ncontextual framework (Douglas 2002; Saito 2007). Second, it is\npossible to provide a kind of sliding scale with one end requiring\nutmost sensibility often obtained after extensive education and\npractice, such as the ability to appreciate twelve-tone music,\nJoyce\u2019s novels, Japanese Noh theater, and bogs, and the other\nend requiring very little education and practice, such as Norman\nRockwell paintings, a military march, a sparkling jewelry piece, and a\ncolorful flower garden. Some aesthetic qualities can be considered\n\u2018major league\u2019 or heavy-weight while other aesthetic\nqualities are \u2018minor league\u2019 or light-weight, without\ndisqualifying the latter from the realm of the aesthetic altogether.\nAfter all, they refer to our qualitative response to the sensory\nexperience of the objects and phenomena and some experiences are more\nintense and profound than others without thereby denying the aesthetic\ndimension of more simple and easy experiences (Leddy 1995, 1997,\n2012a, 2012b; Harris 2000; Ngai 2012; Postrel 2013; Mollar 2014).\n\nIf minor league aesthetic qualities lack sophistication and profundity\ncompared to major league aesthetic qualities, a case can be made that\nthey make up for this lack by their pervasiveness in daily life with\nserious consequences. While we do experience beauty and sublimity in\nour daily life, such occasions are rather rare. More often than not,\nin our everyday life, we judge things for being pretty, nice,\ninteresting, cute, sweet, adorable, boring, plain, drab, dowdy,\nshabby, gaudy, ostentatious, and the like. It is particularly\nimportant to attend to these qualities because, due to their\nprevalence and relatively easy recognition, they exert a powerful\ninfluence on our decisions and actions regarding mundane matters.\nIndeed, strategies in advertising, political campaigning, and\npropaganda often make use of these qualities to direct people\u2019s\nbehavior (Postrel 2003; Mandoki 2007; Saito 2007, 2017a, 2018b;\nSartwell 2010). Those who are concerned with both the prevalence and\nuncritical acceptance of aestheticization of life argue for a more\nactive, engaged, reflective mode of perception instead of passively\nexperiencing and being affected by aestheticization ploys, thereby\ncultivating aesthetic literacy and vigilance (Vihalem 2016; Matteucci\n2017; Potgieter 2017).\n\nAnother worry has been raised about the aesthetic worthiness, or\n\u201caesthetic credentials,\u201d of some experiences (Dowling\n2010). It concerns the purely bodily-oriented responses such as the\nsensation of scratching an itch, receiving a massage, drinking tea, or\nsmelling fishy odor (Irvin 2008a,b). There is a concern that they are\ntoo private and subjective to allow any inter-subjective discussion\nand critical discourse, resulting in subjective relativism and\ncompromising the possibility of  sensus communis.\nKant\u2019s distinction between the beautiful and the merely\nagreeable is often invoked to support this criticism (Parsons and\nCarlson 2008; Soucek 2009; Dowling 2010).\n\nIn response, some thinkers point out that it is a mistake to treat\nthese bodily sensations as an isolated, singular sensory experience.\nAccording to them, in ordinary life, we almost never have an\nexperience of smell, taste, or touch by itself. Instead, our\nexperiences are usually multi-sensory or synaesthetic and take place\nin a specific context (Howes 2005; Howes and Classen 2014). Scratching\nan itch can be a part of experiencing a mosquito-infested bog, or\nexperienced as an annoyance caused by the stiff fabric label sewn on\nthe inside of a new shirt collar. The taste of tea cannot be separated\nfrom its aroma, visual appearance, and the tactile sensations of\ntexture and warmth as one holds the mug and presses the lip against\nits rim. All of these sensory experiences take place in a certain\nsurrounding and situation with its own ambiance, as well as within the\nspecific flow of one\u2019s daily life. One may grab a cup of tea on\nthe run and gulp it down to get the caffeine kick as one rushes to a\nmeeting, or savor each sip as one sits in front of a fireplace\nrelaxing, or participate in the Japanese tea ceremony. Even if the tea\nitself were to remain the same, the experience surrounding its\ningestion changes, sometimes even affecting our experience of the\ntaste of tea itself (Irvin 2009a; Melchionne 2011, 2014; Perullo 2016;\nSaito 2017a). Thus, purely bodily sensation can be folded into the\natmosphere or ambiance constituted by many ingredients. Then what we\nappreciate is not merely a singular bodily sensation in isolation such\nas the tactile sensation or smell but the fittingness or, one may even\nsay, Kantian \u2018purposiveness,\u2019 or lack thereof, created by\nthe relationship between and among factors making up the\natmosphere.\n\nPresumed subjective relativism regarding a purely bodily sensation,\ntherefore, can be mitigated at least to a certain extent if it is\nregarded as one of the many ingredients that make up a larger whole\npermeated by a unified atmosphere, such as a sense of well-being,\ncontentment, comfort, or negatively, a sense of isolation, discomfort,\nuneasiness, or anxiety. Such an appreciation (or depreciation) allows\nsome degree of inter-subjective communication and sharing; indeed many\nliterary narratives provide a rich reservoir of such experiences.\n6. Ambient Aesthetics and Social Aesthetics\n\nThis attention to atmosphere or ambiance of a certain situation\nconstituted by various ingredients has a long tradition in Japanese\naesthetics (Saito 2005). It was also the main point of the\nassociationist aesthetics advocated by Archibald Alison\n(1757\u20131839). Today ambient aesthetics is garnering a renewed\nattention primarily due to works by Gernot B\u00f6hme who suggests\nthat atmosphere should be the central focus of new aesthetics. In our\ndaily life, we often experience the atmospheric character of a\nsituation: tense or relaxed, cheerful or melancholic, exuberant or\nsubdued, inviting or alienating, electrifying or dull. Sometimes a\ndistinct character of a situation is intentionally orchestrated,\noftentimes in a special occasion like a wedding or a funeral, with\nspecifically selected music, decorations, attire, and choreographed\nmovements, to name a few. Some other times, a unified atmosphere\narises spontaneously when various elements making up the physical\nenvironment and human interactions and movements within it happen to\ncongeal (B\u00f6hme 1993, 1998; Miyahara 2014; di Stefano 2017).\n\nAlthough in our daily life we experience and appreciate (or\ndepreciate) a certain atmosphere or ambiance quite frequently, it has\nnot received adequate attention in the aesthetics discourse primarily\nbecause of the lack of clearly defined and delineated\n\u2018object\u2019 of the experience. Without a clear\n\u2018frame\u2019 around the object of experience, critics suggest,\ninter-subjective discussion of its aesthetics is not possible. Nor are\nthere clear criteria, such as art historical conventions, that are\nhelpful in determining what is and is not a part of the aesthetic\nexperience (Parsons and Carlson 2008). Ambiance, air, or atmosphere is\nindeed subjectively-oriented in the sense that one\u2019s experience\nbecomes colored accordingly. However, it should also be noted that it\nis not purely subjective or private, as claimed by critics, insofar as\nit refers to objectively identifiable features of the environment and\nsituation. Furthermore, some contemporary works of art specifically\naim at creating a certain atmosphere that envelops the audience (Z.\nWang 2018).\n\nAmbient aesthetics also highlights the important role played by\nnon-visual sensory experiences that permeate our lived life. The\nrelevance of the so-called lower senses in everyday aesthetics has\nalready been mentioned (Section 5). However, possibly with an\nexception of the gustatory, non-visual sensory experiences, namely the\nauditory, the olfactory, and the haptic, tend to be eclipsed by the\nvisual, although their contribution to our everyday aesthetic\nexperience is undeniable (Ackerman 1991; Tuan 1993; Brady 2005; Howes\n2014; Korsmeyer 2017; Interference Journal (Issue 7, 2019); Shiner\nforthcoming). Sometimes they enrich an overall ambiance, such as a\ncalming ambient sound and a weather-beaten smooth surface of a\nbuilding, while other times they constitute negative aesthetics, such\nas a blaring car stereo sound and a stench from a nearby factory.\nFurthermore, the lack of sounds and smell may be a welcome relief\nwhile at other times it may render the experience deficient (Drobnick\n2005; Anderson forthcoming). Everyday aesthetics encourages attention\nto these non-visual experiences, which helps sharpen our sensibility.\nAttention to these sensory experiences is also critical in\narchitectural practice and urban planning which tend to be dominated\nby the visual orientation (Pearson 1991; Pallasmaa 1999).\n\nPart of what determines the ambiance or atmosphere is human\ninteractions. The character of such interactions is constituted by the\nparticipants\u2019 personality and relationships with others that are\nsubject to aesthetic considerations. In addition to what one does and\nsays, one can be considered warm, cold, formal, aloof, friendly,\nintimidating, gentle, and so forth, largely due to aesthetic factors\nsuch as tone of voice, way of speaking, facial expression, bodily\ngesture and posture, and outward presentation such as clothing, hair\nstyle, ornamentation, and the like. Sometimes the moral character of\none\u2019s action is assessed by aesthetic dimensions over and beyond\nwhat the action accomplishes. For example, one may gobble up a\nlovingly prepared and meticulously arranged meal carelessly and\nindifferently, or one may take time and savor every bite respectfully\nand mindfully to show one\u2019s appreciation for the cook. One can\nclose a door roughly, making a loud noise and startling others, or one\ncan close it gently and carefully so as not to disturb others.\nFinally, one can help a person in need grudgingly and spitefully or do\nso with care and good cheer (Buss 1999; Sherman 2005; Naukkarinen\n2014; Shusterman 2016; Saito 2016, 2017a).\n\nIn these examples, important desiderata in aesthetic experiences can\nalso be regarded as desirable in human relationships: open-mindedness\nto accept and appreciate diversity, respect and reciprocity, full and\nsincere engagement, among others. Established as a sub-category of\neveryday aesthetics by Arnold Berleant, social aesthetics calls\nattention to the fact that the aesthetics plays a surprisingly and\noften unrecognized role in determining the moral character of actions,\npersons, and human interactions (Berleant 2005b, 2010, 2012,\n2017).\n\nFurthermore, social aesthetics promotes cultivating virtues through\neveryday practice. One\u2019s kindness, compassion, thoughtfulness,\nand respect require appropriate expressions guided by aesthetic\nsensibility and skills, in addition to accomplishing a certain deed.\nHarmonious and cooperative interaction with others also requires not\nonly appropriate cultural knowledge but also aesthetic sensibility to\ndecipher group dynamics and determine how best to help create a\ncertain atmosphere (Naukkarinen 2014). A mere conceptual understanding\nof the importance of aesthetics in these interactions is not\nsufficient. Embodied practice is required to contribute to\naesthetically-minded social interactions.\n7. Action-Oriented Aesthetics\n\nSocial aesthetics also sheds light on another new avenue of inquiry\nushered in by everyday aesthetics: the aesthetic dimension of\ndoing things instead of, or in addition to, the experience\ngained as a spectator or beholder. The traditional mode of aesthetic\ninquiry is primarily concerned with analyzing the aesthetic experience\nof a spectator who derives aesthetic pleasure from contemplating an\nobject (or a phenomenon or an event). Even in such an experience, as\nDewey\u2019s characterization of \u2018undergoing\u2019 and\n\u2018doing\u2019 and Berleant\u2019s engagement model indicate,\nthe person is never passive; she is actively engaged with the object\nthrough exercising imagination and interacts with it perceptually,\nintellectually, and emotionally. However, in the most literal sense,\nshe is still an onlooker of the object: a painting, a symphony, a tea\nbowl, a figure skating performance, a flower garden, a piece of\nfurniture, an automobile, a house, and a freshly laundered shirt.\n\nWhile everyday aesthetics includes such spectator-oriented aesthetics,\na major part constituting the flow of everyday life is our active\nengagement with doing things by handling an object, executing an act,\nand producing certain results, all motivated by aesthetic\nconsiderations. Until recently, very little had been explored of the\naesthetic dimensions of active involvement in painting a canvas,\nplaying a violin, skating, gardening, repairing a garment, hanging\nlaundry outdoors, and giving birth (Rautio 2009; Brook 2012; Lintott\n2012). Perhaps food aesthetics illustrates this contrast most clearly.\nFood aesthetics generally focuses on the taste of the food rather than\nthe experience of eating itself or the activity of cooking (except for\nCurtin and Heldke 1992; Visser 1997; Giard 1998; Korsmeyer 1999;\nShusterman 2013; Perullo 2016).\n\nThe difficulty of accounting for the aesthetics involved in these\nactivities from the participants\u2019 perspective is the same\ndifficulty facing ambient aesthetics: the lack of clear delineation of\nobject-hood of aesthetic experience. The constituents of an aesthetic\nobject are more or less clear in the case of a painting or a flower\ngarden appreciated from the spectator\u2019s point of view.\nFurthermore, there is an object one can point to for\nintersubjectivity. However, there is no equivalent\n\u2018object\u2019 of aesthetic experience when it comes to an\nactivity one undertakes. This lack, according to some thinkers,\nsignals the demise of any reasonable discussion as the subject matter\nbecomes hopelessly private with little possibility of intersubjective\ndiscourse. While we can meaningfully debate the aesthetic merit of a\npainting or a flower garden by giving reasons to justify our judgment,\nit is difficult to imagine an equivalent discussion of my experience\nof bodily engagement when executing brush ink painting or digging the\nground and planting flowers for the flower garden.\n\nIf one accepts John Dewey\u2019s notion of having \u201can\nexperience\u201d which gives an aesthetic character to whatever\nexperience one is undergoing, it becomes a challenge to facilitate a\ncritical discourse to determine whether or not one is truly having\n\u201can experience.\u201d The act of planting flowers involves a\nmulti-sensory experience and bodily engagement, as well as designing\nthe garden\u2019s layout. These ingredients may come together in a\nunified manner to give rise to a sense of joy felt by the gardener at\nthe arrival of spring and the anticipation of fully-blossomed flowers.\nIt is difficult to imagine how this gardener\u2019s experience can be\nsubjected to a critical discourse in the same way the flower bed gets\nevaluated aesthetically for its design. Can we have a debate about\nwhether the gardener\u2019s experience was truly aesthetic or whether\nit provided a rich or only mediocre aesthetic experience? If not, is\nthis aspect of our life forever closed to any mode of aesthetic\ninquiry?\n\nThe difficulty felt here regarding the aesthetics of ambiance and\nactions could be attributed to the mode of contemporary Western\naesthetic inquiry which is predominantly judgment-oriented (B\u00f6hme\n1993). Much of mainstream aesthetic debate surrounds the objectivity\nand justifiability of aesthetic judgment. A judgment presupposes the\ndeterminability of an object and its intersubjectively sharable\nexperience. Anything falling outside of it is considered hopelessly\nsubjective and relativistic. However, phenomenological accounts of\nbodily engagement in cooking, sports, and other mundane activities are\nplentiful not only in some aestheticians\u2019 writings but also,\nperhaps more commonly, in writings by practitioners and literary\nauthors (Curtin and Heldke 1992; Giard 1998; Rautio 2009; Tainio\n2015). Body aesthetics is also garnering more attention in recent\nphilosophy and a large part of its concern is the bodily engagement in\naesthetic experience (Bhatt 2013; Irvin 2016).\n\nFurthermore, some agree that the practice of mundane activities,\ndomestic chores in particular, provides an opportunity for one to\nexercise imagination and creativity to inspire an aesthetic experience\n(McCracken 2001; Lee 2010; Highmore 2011a). For example, the activity\nof outdoor laundry hanging can be a chance for the person to arrange\nand hang the items in an aesthetically pleasing way to express her\nrespect and thoughtfulness toward her neighbors and passersby who are\ninevitably exposed to the visual parade of laundered items. At the\nsame time, this activity will occasion her appreciation of the arrival\nof spring after a long winter, as well as anticipation of the sweet\nsmell and crisp texture of dried items thanks to the sunshine and\nfresh air carried by the breeze (Rautio 2009; Saito 2017a). Dismissing\nthese experiences from aesthetic discourse because they do not fit the\nexpected format of analysis and cannot be subjected to a\nverdict-oriented discourse unduly impoverishes the rich content of our\naesthetic life. In addition, these experiences are not hopelessly\nprivate and it is possible that they are generated and shared\ncommunally. Gardening, cooking, and participation in sporting\nactivities can be a group activity and the participants can share and\nhelp with each other to mutually enrich and enhance aesthetic\nexperiences by pointing out the aesthetic contribution of some aspects\nthat others may have missed.\n\nIndeed, it is crucial for everyday aesthetics that these private\nexperiences to be intersubjectively communicable. If the aesthetic\ndimensions of our everyday life are important (and this conviction is\nwhat gave rise to everyday aesthetics in the fist place), then one of\nits tasks is to justify the value of seemingly monadistic experiences\nby facilitating what aesthetic experience in general does best:\nencouraging openness by sharing others\u2019 experiences, viewing the\nworld from perspectives different from one\u2019s own, and enlarging\none\u2019s horizon and vision (Ratiu 2017a). Aesthetic experience\nunderstood in this way supports its educability, educational value,\nand contribution to enhancing life (Potgieter 2017).\n8. Blurring the Line between Art and Life\n\nThe emergence of everyday aesthetics discourse parallels the\nincreasing attempt at blurring the distinction between art and life in\ntoday\u2019s artworld. Although there have been many examples\nthroughout art history of depicting slices of everyday life,\nsuch as Dutch still life paintings, twentieth-century art introduced\nand experimented with different modes of appropriating everyday life,\nmost famously with the use of ready-mades. Since then, artists have\nbeen trying to overcome the presumed separation between art and real\nlife in a number of ways: rejecting the art institutional setting as a\nlocation for their art; denying the necessity of authorial authority;\nembracing various changes made to their works both by nature and human\nagency; blurring the creator/spectator dichotomy by collaborating with\nthe general public to create art as a joint venture; changing the role\nof the artist from the creator/choreographer to a facilitator who\nprovides an occasion or an event for things to happen; literally\nimproving the environment and society by planting trees, cleaning a\nriver, and playing the role of a social worker to promote a dialogue\namong people in conflict; and engaging in mundane activities like\ncooking and farming with tangible products for consumption. These\nattempts have given rise to a number of genres, including situationist\nart, conceptual art, environmental art, happening, performance,\nactivist art, socially engaged art, and art projects characterized as\nembodying \u201crelational aesthetics\u201d or \u201cdialogical\naesthetics\u201d (Kaprow 1993; Spaid 2002, 2012; Bourriaud 2002;\nKester 2004, 2011; Dezeuze 2006; Johnstone 2008; Bishop 2012).\n\nParalleling the movement of art to embrace everyday life, there is a\nmovement in the opposite direction: for everyday life to embrace art.\nWhile aestheticization of life is not a new phenomenon, what is\nnoteworthy in the so-called organizational aesthetics and artification\nstrategy is that they deploy art and art-like ways of thinking and\nacting in those areas of life which have not been traditionally\nassociated with art or aesthetics: medicine, business, education,\nsports, and science, among others, as well as organizational life in\ngeneral (Dars\u00f8 2004; Naukkarinen and Saito 2012; Ratiu 2017b).\nThese professional practices typically privilege rational discourse\ncomprised of logic and rules, but they cannot ignore their aesthetic\ndimensions. Art and aesthetics in this context are not regarded as\ndecorative amenities or prettifying touches. Rather, organizational\naesthetics and artification strategy are based upon the premise that\nhumans negotiate life, whatever the context may be, through sensory\nknowledge and affective experiences by interacting with others and the\nenvironment. As such, working with the aesthetic dimensions of these\nprofessional activities and environments cannot but help achieve the\nrespective goals and, perhaps more importantly, contribute to the\nwellbeing of the members and participants. Art and aesthetics can be a\npowerful ally in directing human endeavors and actions and determining\nthe quality of activities and environments. Such effects range from\nfacilitating creativity and imagination in educational and business\nventures and providing humane and healing environments for vulnerable\npopulations, such as hospital patients and nursing home residents, to\nrendering scientific data easily graspable (Pine and Gilmore 1998;\nLinstead 2000; Postrel 2003; Howes 2005, 2013; Duncum 2007; Tavin\n2007; Dee 2010, 2012; Schulze 2013; Moss and O\u2019Neill 2013, 2014;\nRatiu 2017b; Krawczyk forthcoming).\n\nAs stated at the beginning of this entry, everyday aesthetics was\nfirst proposed as a way of accounting for those aesthetically charged\ndimensions of our lives that had not been adequately addressed by\nart-centered aesthetics. However, early works of everyday aesthetics,\nsuch as given by Saito (2007), are criticized for a rather outdated\nand overly restrictive characterization of so-called art-centered\naesthetics. The presumed distinguishing conditions of art-aesthetics,\nsuch as a relatively clear frame, privileging higher sense, authorial\nidentity, stable identity of the object, and the spectator mode of\nexperience, are no longer applicable to many examples of art today.\nConsequently, the critics urge everyday aesthetics to go beyond simply\nproviding a venue to enumerate those aesthetic dimensions of everyday\nlife that had previously been overlooked and to provide a conceptual\nfoundation. In particular, they advocate conceiving everyday\naesthetics as a continuation of aesthetics discourse that had\npreviously been focused on art (the view variously characterized as a\nweak formulation, continuistic pole, extraordinarist stance, or\nmonolithist model), rather than as something distinct and separate\nfrom art aesthetics (a strong formulation, discontinuistic pole,\nfamiliarity stance, or pluralist model) (see Dowling 2010; Ratiu 2013;\nIannilli 2016; Matteucci 2016 for a clear and helpful\n\u201cmapping\u201d and \u201cnomenclature\u201d of these strands\nof everyday aesthetics).\n\nThose who support the continuity model are specifically concerned to\nprovide a basis for intersubjectivity and normativity for everyday\naesthetics by referencing these features that support aesthetics\ndiscourse in general. Without such a framework, the worry is that\neveryday aesthetics may degenerate into a totally subjective, laissez\nfaire affair which would render the entire project trivial. Unless we\npresuppose the possibility of a sensus communis, that is,\ncommunicability though not necessarily commonality, which makes\nsharing and understanding the other\u2019s experience possible, we\nare locked into a subjective, solipsistic silo. Furthermore, they\npoint out that the monadic characterization of everyday aesthetics\nwithin the general aesthetics discourse is not conducive to fruitfully\naccounting for the ways in which everyday life and art interact and\nform a continuous, ongoing flux of a person\u2019s embodied\nexperience of the lived world. Popular and socially engaged forms of\nart permeate people\u2019s everyday life more than ever and there is\nno reason not to consider experiencing them as a pervasive dimension\nof their lived world. Ultimately, the nature of art is open and\ndynamic and is very much an integral part of people\u2019s life, and\neveryday aesthetics is better served by considering the continuity\nbetween art and everyday. In other words, the initial reactionary mode\nof everyday aesthetics needs to be recast as a proactive mode that\naddresses the totality of our aesthetic engagement with the world,\nwhich includes art, nature, and everyday (Ratiu 2013; Potgieter 2017).\nAlthough approaching the issue from a different angle, another\npossibility is to develop Ranci\u00e8re\u2019s distribution of the\nsensible and explore what is deemed aesthetically relevant within a\nspecific cultural/historical/social context. For the consideration of\nthe regime of the sensible, the presumed distinction between art and\nlife becomes irrelevant (Vihalem 2018).\n9. Significance of Everyday Aesthetics\n\nAs the increasingly prevalent phenomenon of aestheticization of life\nindicates, the aesthetic has a significant power to influence,\nsometimes determine, the quality of life and society. While the power\nof everyday aesthetics can be harnessed to improve the quality of\nlife, it can also be used to serve a political agenda or a business\ngoal. As stated in the sections on the Everyday Aesthetic Qualities\nand Action-Oriented Aesthetics above, everyday aesthetic responses\noften guide people\u2019s actions in the most direct way. If\nsomething attracts us with its aesthetic appeal, we tend to protect\nit, purchase it, or try to maintain its aesthetic value; on the other\nhand, if we don\u2019t find an object or an environment aesthetically\nappealing, we tend to be indifferent to its fate, discard it, or try\nto make it more attractive (Nassauer 1995; Orr 2002). In particular,\ntoday\u2019s global capitalist economy is fueled by \u2018perceived\nobsolescence\u2019 regarding products\u2019 fashionableness and\nstylishness with little to no improvement in their functional values.\nAdditional aesthetic \u2018hidden persuaders\u2019 include branding,\nadvertising campaigns, and environments aesthetically orchestrated for\nstores (Pine and Gilmore 1998, 2013; Postrel 2003; Schulze 2013;\nB\u00f6hme 2017). These positive aesthetic values of and surrounding a\nproduct often hide various instances of \u2018ugliness\u2019\ninvolved in its manufacturing process and afterlife. The negative\naesthetics associated with manufacturing includes environmental\ndevastation caused by resource extraction and pollution, and dismal\nworking conditions of the factory workers, often in developing\nnations, who are forced to endure aesthetic deprivation, not to\nmention health and safety hazards. The negative aesthetics of the\nproduct\u2019s afterlife can be seen in the ever-increasing volume of\ndiscarded items, no longer considered trendy and fashionable, not only\nin municipal landfills but in the ocean. Such \u2018trash\u2019 is\nalso shipped to developing nations where re-usable, and often toxic,\nparts are harvested by local people with no protective gear (Saito\n2018b).\n\nNegative consequences of people\u2019s aesthetic preference can also\nbe found in the uniformly perfect appearance of fruits and vegetables\non the store shelf. The deformed and misshapen items are sometimes\ndiscarded, causing not only literal waste but also creation of methane\ngas from rotting produce. Some other times, a niche market emerges to\ndivert such imperfect items earmarked for free giveaway to the needy\nand to commodify them for cheap sale to the general public, thereby\nexacerbating the food insecurity of the vulnerable population. The\nAmerican attraction to the weed-free, velvety-smooth, uniformly green\nlawn has serious environmental ramifications, such as excessive water\nuse and chemical fertilizer, herbicide, and insecticide. When outdoor\nlaundry hanging and wind turbines are judged to be an eyesore,\ncommunities create an ordinance to prohibit them, preventing the\nopportunity to create a more sustainable way of living (Duerksen and\nGoebel 1999; Gipe 2002; Saito 2004, 2017a; Gray 2012). \n\nContrariwise, the success of sustainable design and goods produced\nunder humane conditions often depends upon the acceptance of new\naesthetic paradigms, such as gardens consisting of wildflowers or\nedible plants, garments and furniture made with recycled or reused\nmaterials, and green buildings that reduce literal footprints on the\nland as well as carbon footprints (Walker 2006, 2017; Salwa 2019).\nSome work has also been done to explore the ways in which moral\nvirtues such as respect, thoughtfulness, and humility can be expressed\nnot only by persons but also by the aesthetic features of objects and\nbuilt structures and environments (Norman 1990; Whiteley 1993, 1999;\nSep\u00e4nmaa 1995a, 1995b; Pallasmaa 1999; Taylor 2000; Orr 2002;\nBerleant 2005, 2010, 2012; Berleant and Carlson 2007; Saito 2007,\n2017a). In addition, as indicated by social aesthetics, cultivation of\naesthetic sensibility and practice of aesthetic skills can contribute\nto facilitating respectful, thoughtful, and humane social\ninteractions\n\nThe relationship between the aesthetic and the ethical has been one of\nthe contested issues in the aesthetics discourse regarding art.\nDebates ensue regarding the aesthetic relevance of the moral content\nof art, the artist\u2019s or performer\u2019s character, and the\nprocess involved in creating a work of art. The positions range from\ntheir complete separation supported by aestheticism to their\nintegration advocated by moralists. However, the ethical implications\nof art (at least in its more conventional form) do not have a\ndirect bearing on changing the world. They may affect the\naudience\u2019s perception, attitude, and worldview, which may lead\nthem toward a certain action, but the impact is indirect. In\ncomparison, the aesthetic impact of everyday affairs often leads to\ndirect consequences that change the state of the world. Just as in\nart-centered aesthetics, however, there are differing views on whether\nor not and to what degree the ethical implications should affect the\naesthetic value of the object. Some prefer to separate them and\nprotect the autonomous realm of the aesthetic (Forsey 2013). Others\nadvocate integration by calling for an aesthetic paradigm shift (Orr\n2002; Saito 2007, 2017a, 2018b; Maskit 2011) not only by explicitly\nincluding the moral dimensions of objects and environments in their\naesthetics but also by rethinking the fundamental ways in which we\nhumans interact with the material world. At least according to the\nWestern tradition, the material world lacks any agency in a morally\nrelevant sense and its value is exhausted by its instrumental utility\nto humans. However, just as the long-held Western anthropocentric\nattitude toward nature has come under scrutiny, some thinkers propose\na more respectful attitude toward and interaction with the material\nworld (Ingold 2000; Nielsen 2005; Brook 2012; Perullo 2016; Saito\n2018b).\n\nThe moral, social, and political significance of everyday aesthetics\nis perhaps most acute in body aesthetics. Culturally- and\nsocially-constructed, and often impossible to achieve, aesthetic\nstandards of the human body lead people to engage in various beauty\npractices, ranging from cosmetic surgery and extreme dieting to\ningestion of dangerous substances and bleaching of the skins, which\noften compromise health (Brand 2000, 2012; Lintott 2003; Rhode 2010;\nArcher and Ware 2018; Widdows 2018). Aesthetics is also implicated as\na primary instrument of justifying the societal oppression of\ndisabled, sexed, gendered, or racialized bodies. Those individuals\nwhose bodies do not meet the aesthetic standard suffer from an\nunfounded perception that their physical appearance correlates with\ntheir competence, intelligence, and moral character, and are subjected\nto many forms of injustice and discrimination in employment, social\nstanding, personal relationships, and economic status. Aesthetic\nqualifications for an ideal body can be explicitly institutionalized\nas in Nazism or policies requiring a certain appearance of employees,\nor implicitly referenced to reinforce the existing stereotype of the\noppressed groups (Garland-Thomson 2009; Siebers 2010; Irvin 2016; P.\nTaylor 2016; also see the entries on\n feminist perspectives on the body,\n feminist perspectives on disability, and\n feminist perspectives on objectification).\n \n\nThe utilization of aesthetics as a strategy for consumerism and\npolitical agenda has thus been a concern for everyday aesthetics.\nAesthetic appeal can entice people to embrace, support, and promote\nproblematic causes that may be ultimately contrary to their wellbeing\nand quality of life, as well as to the ideal of justice and democracy.\nInstead of nurturing citizens and civil society engaged in a\nthoughtful and informed exchange, discussion, and critical reflections\nof ideas, aestheticization of everyday life is often used to cultivate\nconsumers for the market, audience for political spectacles, and\naccomplices in perpetuating oppression and injustice. However, this\ndanger of aestheticization of everyday life is not necessarily\ninevitable. Some argue that it is possible and indeed critical that we\nencourage an aestheticization strategy in the service of promoting\njustice, democracy, citizenry, and civil discourse (Nielsen 2005;\nMatteucci 2017; Saito 2017a, 2018b).\n10. New and Future Developments\n\nWhile everyday aesthetics has matured significantly since its\nrelatively recent emergence in the Western aesthetics discourse, there\nstill remain many tasks to be tackled. In light of the new\ndevelopments described below, possibilities and opportunities abound\nto guide the future of everyday aesthetics.\n\nFirst, many critics, as well as supporters, of everyday aesthetics\npoint out that it needs to be anchored in a firm theoretical\nfoundation (Forsey 2013a; Ratiu 2013; Iannilli 2016). Among the\npossibilities suggested are finding roots in phenomenology,\nstructuralism and poststructuralism, in addition to pragmatism that is\noften cited as the primary root (Potgieter 2017). Also suggested is to\nframe everyday aesthetics as a practical philosophy with its emphasis\non practical knowledge that is contingent and relational as well as\nproviding agency for acting for common good (Vihalem 2016; Ratiu\n2017a). Another suggestion is to provide a theory of aesthetic\nperception based upon a specific mode of attention (Nanay 2016, 2018).\nThese suggestions are made specifically to address and possibly\nresolve the perceived conflicts and tensions debated by everyday\naestheticians between everyday and non-everyday, life and art, theory\nand practice, ordinary and extraordinary, routine and non-routine,\nfamiliar and unfamiliar, and bodily-oriented (lower) senses and\ncognitively-oriented (higher) senses. A firm theoretical footing\nshould also support intersubjectivity of aesthetic experience so as\nnot to render everyday aesthetics hopelessly subjective and trivial,\none of the common criticisms lodged against it. In addition, a\ntheoretical foundation is thought to help illuminate the political\ndimensions of everyday aesthetics, specifically the politically\ncharged regime of the sensible and the increasing aestheticization of\ncommerce and politics that treats people more as consumers than as\ncitizens.\n\nSecond, as was discussed in Section 2, what counts as everyday is a\ncomplicated matter, and one of the complications is the fact that our\nlived world is changing rapidly due to technology as well as climate\nchange. We cannot imagine our everyday life today without the use of\ninternet, social media, Googling, big data, virtual reality, and the\nlike. The future with self-driving vehicles, wearable technology, and\nAI is already here. Although it is safe to assume that in the\nforeseeable future we humans will still negotiate our lives surrounded\nby and interacting with various objects in the way that has always\nbeen familiar to us, our everyday life will increasingly include and\nbe affected by technological advancements. Furthermore, many\npeople\u2019s physical environments consisting of nature and built\nstructures are bound to be transformed by climate change, drastically\nchanging their everyday affairs and cultural practices (Nomikos\n2018).\n\nIf everyday aesthetics has been focused on what has been characterized\nas a relatively stable environment consisting of familiar surroundings\nand material objects, the challenge is to explore whether and how\nrapid changes to the familiar everyday affects the nature of everyday\naesthetics as a discourse. Some works have already begun, indicated by\nthe research on the effects of self-driving vehicles (Mladenovi\u0107,\net al 2019), cartographical tools (Iannilli 2014; Lehtinen 2019), and\nthe prevalence of all kinds of machine in general (Naukkarinen 2019).\nThese researches explore whether and how these machines facilitate an\nengaged experience of the users, how they move aesthetics discourse\nfrom the emphasis on contemplative experiences to immediate,\nbodily-engaged experiences guided by the functionality of the object,\nand how they impact privacy as well as the nature of aesthetics as an\nacademic discipline. It may be the case that the new normal for our\neveryday world becomes a rapid and constant change rather than\nstability and familiarity that have been considered a hallmark of\neveryday life to date. This future projection may require everyday\naestheticians to review some of the presuppositions that have\nsupported their discussion.\n\nThird, everyday aesthetics has become influential in various\ndisciplines and practices outside of philosophical discourse. As\nindicated by many works included in the bibliography, everyday\naesthetics has been embraced as providing both principles and\nstrategies by fields ranging from business, consumerism, healthcare,\nsports, law, science, and education to urban studies, sustainability,\nfashion, and design. This wide acceptance and utilization of everyday\naesthetics is due to its insight regarding the prevalence of\naesthetics in everyone\u2019s lived world, as well as its aspiration\nthat cultivation of aesthetic literacy and sensibility will contribute\nto improving one\u2019s wellbeing, social interactions, and the state\nof the society and the world. But the challenge, as well as\nopportunity, posed by these heterogeneous discipline-specific\npractices is to inquire whether there is an overarching unifying\nnotion of aesthetic experience and aesthetic practice. Even if there\nis a unifying notion, a further question is whether we should arrive\nat such a notion by building on case studies from these various\ndisciplines (Vihalem 2016).\n\nFinally, in light of an increasing attention to the culture-specific\nnature of various discourses, everyday aesthetics faces both the\nopportunity and challenge for situating its place in a global context.\nGlobalization of aesthetics is actively sought particularly regarding\nart, as indicated by decolonizing the discourses of art, art history,\nand museum practice. It was explained at the beginning of this entry\nthat everyday aesthetics\u2019 emergence was historically and\nculturally situated to challenge what was considered to be\nart-centered aesthetics that dominated the Western aesthetics of the\nlast century. In many cultural traditions, including those that do not\nhave a concept equivalent to the Western notion of art, there is a\nlong legacy of aesthetic interests and concerns permeating, informing,\nand guiding people\u2019s lives, whether regarding the management of\ndaily life, social relationships, spiritual rites, cultural\nactivities, or creation of objects (see Higgins 1996 and Higgins, et\nal. 2017 for a collection of essays representing diverse non-Western\naesthetic traditions). For example, the long-held Chinese tradition of\n\u201caesthetics of living\u201d that has been practiced as a way of\nenhancing the quality of lived experience and contributing to\npeople\u2019s happiness and wellbeing, rather than conceived as an\nabstract theory, is receiving a renewed attention by Chinese scholars\nwho are working on a cross-cultural dialogue (Liu 2014, 2017, 2018;\nPan 2014; Q. Wang 2014). Similarly, Japanese cultural tradition is\ngarnering an increasing interest by those who are exploring how its\naesthetics goes beyond the established arts to inform people\u2019s\neveryday lives (Ikegami 2005; Sasaki 2013; Otabe 2018). Researching\nhow different cultural traditions promote their respective everyday\naesthetic practices helps to highlight the cultural situatedness of\nsome of the assumptions of Western philosophy and aesthetics, such as\nthe relationships between art and life, the theoretical and the\npractical, the subject and the object, as well as between and among\nthe aesthetic, the moral, the social, the practical, the existential,\nand the spiritual.\n\nEveryday aesthetics began its task in the spirit of inclusivity by\nexpanding the materials for deliberation. The discourse continues its\ntask with the same spirit of inclusivity by encouraging\nculture-specific, discipline-specific, and future-speculative\nexplorations, while at the same time searching for a theoretical\nfoundation that allows for intersubjective, intercultural, and\ninterdisciplinary exchanges.\n", "bibliography": {"categories": [], "cat_ref_text": {"ref_list": ["Ackerman, Diane, 1991, <em>A Natural History of the Senses</em>,\nNew York: Vintage Books.", "Al Qudowa, Salem Y., 2017, \u201cAesthetic Value of Minimalist\nArchitecture in Gaza\u201d, <em>Contemporary Aesthetics</em>, 15: article 14.\n [<a href=\"https://digitalcommons.risd.edu/liberalarts_contempaesthetics/vol15/iss1/14/\" target=\"other\">Al Qudowa 2017 available online</a>]", "Ameel, Lieven and Sirpa Tani, 2011, \u201cEveryday Aesthetics In\nAction: Parkour Eyes and the Beauty of Concrete Walls\u201d,\n<em>Emotion, Space and Society</em>, 5(3): 164\u2013173.", "Anderson, Erik, forthcoming, \u201cAesthetic Appreciation of\nSilence\u201d, <em>Contemporary Aesthetics</em>.", "Archer, Alfred and Lauren Ware, 2018, \u201cBeyond the Call of\nBeauty: Everyday Aesthetic Demands Under Patriarchy\u201d, <em>The\nMonist</em>, 101(1): 114\u2013127.", "Attfield, Judy, 2000, <em>Wild Things: The Material Culture of\nEveryday Life</em>, Oxford: Berg.", "Bennett, Jane, 2010, <em>Vibrant Matter: A Political Ecology of\nThings</em>, Durham: Duke University Press.", "Bennett, Jill, 2012, <em>Practical Aesthetics: Events, Affects and\nArt after 9/11</em>, London: I.B.Tauris.", "Barthes, Roland, 1990, <em>Mythologies</em>, Annette Lavers\n(trans.), New York: The Noonday Press.", "Berleant, Arnold, 1970, <em>Aesthetic Field: A Phenomenology of\nAesthetic Experience</em>, Springfield: Thomas.", "\u2013\u2013\u2013, 1991, <em>Art and Engagement</em>,\nPhiladelphia: Temple University Press.", "\u2013\u2013\u2013, 1992, <em>The Aesthetics of\nEnvironment</em>, Philadelphia: Temple University Press.", "\u2013\u2013\u2013, 1997, <em>Living in the Landscape: Toward\nan Aesthetics of Environment</em>, Lawrence: University Press of\nKansas.", "\u2013\u2013\u2013, 2004, <em>Re-thinking Aesthetics: Rogue\nEssays on Aesthetics and the Arts</em>, Aldershot: Ashgate.", "\u2013\u2013\u2013, 2005a, <em>Aesthetics and Environment:\nVariations on a Theme</em>, Aldershot: Ashgate.", "\u2013\u2013\u2013, 2005b, \u201cIdeas for a Social\nAesthetic\u201d, in <em>The Aesthetics of Everyday Life</em>, Andrew\nLight and Jonathan M.
