Multiple Moves and the Optional PD\n\nSpeaking generally, one might say that a PD is a game in which a\n\u201ccooperative\u201d outcome obtainable only when every player\nviolates rational self-interest is unanimously preferred to the\n\u201cselfish\u201d outcome obtained when every player adheres to\nrational self-interest. We can characterize the selfish outcome either\nas the result of each player pursuing its dominant (strongly dominant)\nstrategy, or as the unique weak (strong) nash equilibrium. In a two\nmove game the two characterizations come to the same thing\u2014a\ndominant move pair is a unique equilibrium and a unique equilibrium is\na dominant move pair. As the payoff matrix below shows, however, the\ntwo notions diverge in a game with more than two moves.\n\n\n\n\n\\(\\bC\\)\n\\(\\bD\\)\n\\(\\bN\\) \n\n\\(\\bC\\)\n\\(R,R\\)\n\\(S,T\\)\n\\(T,S\\) \n\n\\(\\bD\\)\n\\(T,S\\)\n\\(P,P\\)\n\\(R,S\\) \n\n\\(\\bN\\)\n\\(S,T\\)\n\\(S,R\\)\n\\(S,S\\)  \n\n\nHere each player can choose \u201ccooperate\u201d, (\\(\\bC\\))\n\u201cdefect\u201d (\\(\\bD\\) ), or \u201cneither\u201d\n(\\(\\bN\\)),and the payoffs are ordered as before. Defection is no\nlonger dominant, because each player is better off choosing \\(\\bC\\)\nthan \\(\\bD\\) when the other chooses \\(\\bN\\). Nevertheless \\((\\bD,\n\\bD)\\) is still the unique equilibrium. Let us label a game like this\nin which the selfish outcome is the unique equilibrium an\nequilibrium PD, and one in which the selfish outcome is a\npair of dominant moves a dominance PD. As will be seen below,\nattempts to \u201csolve\u201d the PD by allowing conditional\nstrategies can create multiple-move games that are themselves\nequilibrium PDs.\n\nThree-move games with a slightly different structure have received\nattention under the label \u201coptional PD.\u201d See, for example,\nKitcher (2011), Kitcher (1993), Batali and Kitcher, Szab\u00f3 and\nHauert, Orbell and Dawes (1993), and Orbell and Dawes (1991). The\nfirst three sources take optional games also to allow players to\nsignal willingness to engage (i.e., play \\(\\bC\\) or \\(\\bD\\) against)\nparticular opponents. The simple three-move games without signaling\ndiscussed in this section are called \u201csemi-optional\u201d in\nBatali and Kitcher. \\(S,R,P\\) and \\(T\\) payoffs are ordered as before,\nbut the payoff matrix now contains, in addition, an\n\u201copt-out\u201d value, \\(O\\), that lies between \\(P\\) and\n\\(R\\).\n\n\n\n\\(\\bC\\)\n\\(\\bD\\)\n\\(\\bN\\) \n\n\\(\\bC\\)\n\\(R,R\\)\n\\(S,T\\)\n\\(O,O\\) \n\n\\(\\bD\\)\n\\(T,S\\)\n\\(P,P\\)\n\\(O,O\\) \n\n\\(\\bN\\)\n\\(O,O\\)\n\\(O,O\\)\n\\(O,O\\) \n\n\nIn this version of the game, defection is no longer a dominant move\nand mutual defection is no longer an equilibrium outcome. If Column\ncooperates, Row does best by defecting; if Column defects, Row does\nbest by playing \\(\\bN\\); and if Column plays \\(\\bN\\), then Row does\nequally well by playing any move. From the outcome of mutual \\(\\bD\\)\neither player can benefit by unilaterally switching to \\(\\bN\\). But\nfrom the outcome of mutual \\(\\bN\\), neither party can benefit by\nunilaterally changing moves. So the optional PD is a weak equilibrium\nPD, with \\(\\bN\\) playing the role of defection. Orbell and Dawes (1991\nand 1993) add the additional condition that the opt-out payoff \\(O\\)\nis equal to zero. In an optional PD, a rational player will engage\n(i.e., play either \\(\\bC\\) or \\(\\bD\\)) if and only if she expects her\nopponent to cooperate. For, if her opponent does cooperate, she will\nbe guaranteed at least \\(R\\) by engaging and exactly \\(O\\) by not\nengaging, whereas if her opponent does not cooperate she will be\nguaranteed at most \\(P\\) by engaging and exactly \\(O\\) by not\nengaging. This feature becomes especially salient when \\(O\\) is zero,\nfor then the payoff for engaging is positive if and only if one's\nopponent cooperates.\n\nThe description of the \u201cneither\u201d move and\n\u201copt-out\u201d payoffs varies somewhat in accounts of the\noptional PD. For Kitcher they frequently represent a choice to\n\u201cgo solo.\u201d For example, a baboon, rather than thoroughly\nor sloppily grooming a partner in exchange for being groomed\nthoroughly or sloppily by its partner, may choose to groom itself.\nOften, on the other hand, it is suggested is that \\(\\bN\\) represents a\nchoice to \u201csit out\u201d the game, perhaps in order to obtain a\nmore suitable partner with whom to play later. The significance of\nthis difference, if any, will emerge in iterated and evolutionary\nversions of the game. (See sections 11\u201317 below.) Those who\nwrite about the optional PD often express the hope that it might\nprovide a suitable model to investigate the idea that cooperation can\nbe achieved if agents select the partners with whom they interact.\nThat idea is modeled somewhat differently, and perhaps more directly,\nin Social Network Games discussed in\n section 19\n below. Further discussion of the idea is left to that section.\n\nOrbell and Dawes are particularly concerned with an explanation for\ncooperative behavior that rests on the empirically supported\nhypothesis that individuals often base expectations about behavior of\nothers on their knowledge of their own behavior and tendencies. This\nhypothesis suggests that a cooperator is more likely than a defector\nto expect others to cooperate and therefore, if he is rational, more\nlikely to engage in the optional PD. Orbell and Dawes (1991)\ndemonstrate that, if a cooperator is substantially more likely than a\ndefector to expect his opponent to cooperate, then (provided the odds\nof his opponent cooperating are sufficiently high), a cooperator can\nactually expect a higher return than a defector in the optional PD.\nOrbell and Dawes (1993) present experimental evidence that\nparticipants in an optional PD do receive higher average payouts than\nthose in the corresponding PD lacking the \\(\\bN\\) move. They provide\nclever statistical arguments to support the following hypotheses:\nintending cooperators (those who cooperate when they must engage) do\nbetter in the optional PD than in the corresponding PD; intending\ndefectors generally do worse in the optional PD; under some conditions\nthese gains and losses are sufficient to make the intending\ncooperators better off than the intending defectors (as might be\npredicted by the theoretical result of the previous paper); and,\nfinally, those who expect cooperation from others (as evidenced by\ntheir engagement) do so on the basis of their own tendency to\ncooperate rather rather than any direct discernment of the character\nof their opponent.
