    "main_text": "Life and Work\n1. Life and Work\n\nAristotle was born in Stagira on the northern Aegean coast in 384BCE.\nHis father Nicomachus was physician to King Amyntas III of Macedon,\nand his mother was of a wealthy family from the island of Euboea. He\nwas sent at the age of 17 to Athens, where he studied in Plato\u2019s\nAcademy for 20 years, until Plato\u2019s death in 347. By then he had\ndeveloped his own distinctive philosophical ideas, including his\npassion for the study of nature. He joined a philosophical circle in\nAssos on the coast of Asia Minor, but soon moved to the nearby island\nof Lesbos where he met Theophrastus, a young man with similar\ninterests in natural science. Between the two of them they originated\nthe science of biology, Aristotle carrying out a systematic\ninvestigation of animals, Theophrastus doing the same for plants.\n\nIn 343 Aristotle was asked by Philip II of Macedon to tutor his son\nAlexander. By 335 he had returned to Athens, now under the control of\nhis former student Alexander. With Theophrastus he founded a\n\u2018school\u2019 in a public sanctuary known as the Lyceum. He\nheaded the Lyceum until the death of Alexander the Great in 323. With\nanti-Macedonian feelings running high in Athens, Aristotle retired to\nhis mother\u2019s birthplace. He died there in 322BCE.\n\nThe surviving corpus of Aristotle derives from medieval manuscripts\nbased on a 1st century BCE edition. There were no\ncommentaries on the biological works written until they were\ncollectively translated into Arabic. The first appearance of\nAristotle\u2019s biological writings in the West are Latin\ntranslations, by Michael Scot, of an Arabic edition, which forms the\nbasis of Albertus Magnus\u2019 De animalibus. In the\n13th century, William of Moerbeke produced a Latin\ntranslation directly from the Greek. The first printed editions and\ntranslations date to the late 15th century, the most widely\ncirculated being that of Theodorus Gaza. In addition to the three\nworks traditionally referred to as History of Animals\n(HA), Parts of Animals (PA) and\nGeneration of Animals (GA), there are a number of\nbriefer \u2018essays\u2019 on more specialized topics: On animal\nmotion, On animal locomotion, On respiration,\nOn life and death, On youth and old age, On\nlength and shortness of life, On sleeping and waking,\nOn the senses and their objects (the last six being included\nin the so-called Parva naturalia). Whether one should\nconsider De Anima (On the soul) part of this project\nor not is a difficult question. What is certainly clear, however, is\nthat there are important connections between the theoretical approach\nto the relationship between body and soul defended in that work and\nthe distinctive way that Aristotle approaches the investigation of\nanimals.\n\nIn order to understand Aristotle\u2019s distinctive approach to the\nstudy of living things, it is imperative to situate it within his\nnatural philosophy and his philosophy of science. The first book of\nAristotle\u2019s Parts of Animals is, in fact, largely\ndevoted to doing just that, and after a brief discussion of\nAristotle\u2019s general views about scientific inquiry and\nexplanation, we will turn to it.\n",
