    "main_text": "Main Schools and Lineages || Tianshi dao\n3.1 Tianshi dao (Way of the Celestial Masters)\n\nIn one of his transformations, Laojun (Lord Lao) appeared\u2014in 142\nCE, according to the traditional date\u2014to Zhang Daoling and\nestablished with him the Covenant with the Powers of Orthodox Unity\n(zhengyi mengwei). Zhang Daoling, who may have been a healer,\nwas named Celestial Master (tianshi), and he in turn pledged\nto establish a community that would follow Daoist principles. His\ngrandson and third Celestial Master, Zhang Lu, created and presided\nover a politically and economically autonomous \u201ctheocracy\u201d\nin Hanzhong (in present-day Sichuan), subdivided into 24 zhi\n(\u201cadministrations\u201d, sometimes rendered as\n\u201cparishes\u201d by scholars who see analogies with the early\nChristian Church).\n\nSince its origins, Tianshi dao, or the Way of the Celestial\nMasters, proposed to provide an exemplary and comprehensive model of\nreligious and social organization (Hendrischke 2000; Schipper 2008;\nKleeman 2010 and 2016). The population was organized and governed on the basis\nof \u201cregisters\u201d (lu), which existed in two forms:\nhousehold registers (recording births, marriages, and deaths) and\nindividual registers (conferring rank in the social and celestial\nbureaucracies, and listing the spirits under a person\u2019s command,\nwhose number increased according to age). Healing rites were one of\nthe main practices. Importantly, illnesses were seen as owed neither\nto demonic influences (as in exorcism) nor to imbalance of cosmic forces (as in classical medicine), but to moral\nfaults. As part of the healing ritual, an officiant submitted\npetitions\u2014reporting the petitioner\u2019s fault, confession,\nrepentance, and request for aid\u2014to the Officers of Earth, Water,\nand Heaven, the three main original Tianshi dao deities. An analogous\nemphasis on ethics and morals is the main feature of the best-known\nearly Tianshi dao text, a partially-preserved commentary to the\nDaode jing (Bokenkamp 1997: 29\u2013148).\n\nThe diaspora of the Celestial Masters\u2019 communities after the end\nof the Han (early 3rd century) had the unintended result of\nspreading the religion throughout China. Under the name Way of the\nCorrect Unity (Zhengyi dao), Tianshi dao is in the present day one of the two\nmain branches of Daoism, where it takes charge of\nthe main forms of communal ritual.\n",
