    "main_text": "Other issues || Mental causation\n6.1 Mental causation\n\nDescartes accepted the common assumption that not only do physical\nevents have mental effects, but mental events have physical effects\n(for example, thinking about the political situation makes me write a\nletter). The difficulty for his dualism, it was thought, was to\nunderstand how the nonphysical could have effects on the physical. But\nif zombies are possible \u2014 which requires the physical world to\nbe causally closed \u2014 there is no work for nonphysical qualia to\ndo. In that case the difficulty is to understand how, in spite of\nappearances, the nonphysical could fail to have effects on\nthe physical. Still supposing zombies are possible, it then becomes\nhard to see any alternative to parallelism or epiphenomenalism, with\nthe radical revision of common assumptions about mental causation that\nthose views entail. True, the friends of zombies do not seem compelled\nto be epiphenomenalists or parallelists about the actual\nworld. They may be interactionists, holding that our world is not\nphysically closed, and that as a matter of actual fact nonphysical\nproperties do have physical effects. Or they may adopt some variety of\npanpsychism, according to which what is metaphysically fundamental is\nnot physical properties, but phenomenal or perhaps\n\u2018protophenomenal\u2019 ones (Chalmers 1991, 297\u2014299;\n1999, 492; Goff 2017; Strawson 2008) \u2014 a view arguably\ncompatible with the causal closure of the physical. But neither of\nthose options is easy. Abandoning causal closure appears to conflict\nwith empirical evidence; while the idea that phenomenal or\nquasi-phenomenal properties are fundamental remains obscure.\n",
