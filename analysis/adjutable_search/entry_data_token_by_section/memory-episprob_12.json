    "main_text": "Justification and Beyond || Knowledge-How\n3.4 Knowledge-How\n\nThis entry has discussed memory and knowledge, but only one type of\nknowledge. The type is knowledge-that, or propositional knowledge.\nWhat is known here is, or has the form of, a proposition. Maria knows\nthat the 49ers should have won Super Bowl LIV, and this is\npropositional knowledge, or knowledge-that. Another type of knowledge\nis knowledge-how (see entry on\n knowledge how).\n Maria knows how to throw a football. This is knowledge-how.\n\nThere is much discussion of how these two types of knowledge relate. A\nstandard view is that they are importantly distinct types. A\ncontroversial view, however, is that knowledge-how consists in or\nrequires knowledge-that. This view is intellectualism. The\nphilosophy and psychology of memory might shed light on how the two\ntypes of knowledge relate. There is evidence that the two types rely\non distinct memory systems (Michaelian 2011c). Not all knowledge-how\ninvolves knowledge-that. Thus, intellectualism appears false.\nAdditionally, memory for how to execute physical actions, or\nremembering-how, appears closely related to knowledge-how.\nRemembering-how can endure longer than related propositional\nknowledge, allowing individuals with dementia to retain certain skills\n(Sutton & Williamson 2014). If remembering-how suffices for\nknowledge-how, this may be further evidence against intellectualism.\nThe subject has lost the knowledge-that while keeping the relevant\nknowledge-how.\n",
