    "main_text": "Beauty and Love\n3. Beauty and Love\n\n\nIn the thought of Judah Abrabanel, the concepts of beauty\n(bellezza) and love (amore) become technical terms\nthrough which he examines virtually every traditional philosophical\nissue. Frequently, however, his discussion of one of these terms\nis predicated on the existence of the other; as a result, beauty and\nlove are inseparable in the Dialoghi, undoubtedly mirroring\nJudah\u2019s understanding of the way in which these two principles\noperate in the universe. The intimate relationship between these\ntwo principles may be witnessed in his definition of beauty as that\n\u201cwhich delights the mind that recognizes it and moves it to\nlove\u201d (dilettando l\u2019animo col suo conoscimento, il\nmuove ad \n amare).[20]\n Without Beauty, in other words, the intellect is\nunable to desire something outside of itself and, thus, it is\neffectively unable to cognize. Judah subsequently argues that the lower\nsenses (i.e., taste, smell or touch) cannot grasp Beauty; only the\nhigher senses (e.g., sight and hearing) can\u2014in addition, of\ncourse, to the imagination and the\n intellect.[21] \n Moreover, since Beauty is\nmirrored throughout the universe, physical objects (notes, melodies,\netc.) both participate in and point the way towards this incorporeal\nBeauty:\n\n\nBeauty is only found in the objects of sight (oggetti del\nviso), such as beautiful forms and shapes and beautiful pictures,\nthe perfect symmetry of the parts with the whole, well-proportioned\nlimbs, beautiful colors and clear light, the sun, the moon and the\nstars, and the heavens in all their splendor. This grace exists\nin objects of sight by reason of their spiritual nature, and it is the\ncustom to enter through the clear and spiritual eyes, to delight our\nsoul and move it to a love of such an object; and this is what it is\nthat we call beauty. It is also found in objects of hearing, such\nas beautiful oratory, voices, speech, song music, consonance,\nproportion and harmony. For in the spiritual nature of these\nthings is found grace which moves the soul to delight and to love\nthrough the medium of the spiritual sense of hearing. Thus grace\nand beauty are found among beautiful things that are endowed with a\nspiritual nature (sensi \n spirituali).[22]\n\n\nBased on this and other passages, Judah argues that it is primarily\nby means of the beauty of created things that the individual is able to\napprehend and move towards incorporeal or spiritual Beauty. Love\nis what is ultimately responsible for directing the soul and the\nintellect of the individual to increasingly spiritual matters.\n",
