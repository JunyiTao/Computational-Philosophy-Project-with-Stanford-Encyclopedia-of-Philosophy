    "main_text": "The Combination Question: How Do Thick Concepts Relate Evaluation and Description? || Separabilist Views\n3.1 Separabilist Views\n\nAccording to Separability, the evaluative and non-evaluative aspects\nof thick terms and concepts are distinct components that can at least\nin principle be disentangled from one another. In this section\nwe\u2019ll discuss how Separabilists may specify the non-evaluative\ndescriptive content and its relation to the evaluative content. By way\nof preliminaries, note that many Separabilists take the evaluative\ncontent of thick terms to be located in their truth-conditions, but if\nthose evaluations are some other kind of features of thick terms or\ntheir uses, they will be separable from the non-evaluative descriptive\ncontents of thick terms in whatever way such features are in general\nseparable from truth-conditional meaning (see\n section 4).\n While Separabilists often take this evaluative content to be thin,\nSeparability as such doesn\u2019t require this. The evaluative\ncontent of \u201cWhat you did was tactless\u201d might not be\n\u201cWhat you did was pro tanto bad\u201d but more like\n\u201cWhat did you did was bad in a certain way\u201d, where the\nspecification of the \u201ccertain way\u201d will introduce\ndescriptive information, such as \u201cpertaining to manners\u201d.\nAlternatively the evaluative contents of thick terms might be given by\naffective concepts such as admirable or amusing\n(Tappolet 2004; for criticism, see Harcourt\nand Thomas 2013). On neither view does Separability entail Thin\nCentralism, although if admirable means simply worthy of\nadmiration, Thin Centralism can be maintained. Note that when we\nsee below some Separabilists proposing an \u201canalysis\u201d of\nthick terms, they needn\u2019t be understood as claiming that any\nactual language allows us to give a satisfactory statement of a\nputative analysis of a thick term or concept. Our inability to provide\nsuch a statement doesn\u2019t show that the term or concept is\nunanalyzable or that Inseparability is true.\n\nIn what kind of relation does the evaluative content E of a\nthick term stand to its non-evaluative descriptive content D if\nthey are separable? In\n section 2.1\n we saw a simple view about the connection: D entails E.\nBut this threatens an is-ought gap which many want to\nmaintain, commits you to Descriptive Equivalence, and makes you\nvulnerable to the anti-disentangling argument. (From any such\nD we can construct an independently intelligible purely\nnon-evaluative description with the same extension as the thick term\nin question.) We also think that in some way selfish actions are bad\nin a certain way because or in virtue of the agent\ngiving a certain degree of priority to herself over others; the\nconnection doesn\u2019t seem merely conjunctive. Separabilists might\nthen seek to analyze thick terms or concepts as featuring a relation\nwhich is explanatory but where D doesn\u2019t entail\nE. In this vein, Stephan Burton suggests that thick terms can\nbe analyzed as meaning \u201cx is E in virtue of some\nparticular instance of D\u201d (Burton 1992; see also Tappolet\n2004). Selfish, for instance, would mean something like\n\u201cbad in a certain way in virtue of some particular instance of\ngiving priority to oneself over others\u201d. For E to hold in\nvirtue of some particular instance of D is for E to\ndepend on \u201cthe various different characteristics and\ncontexts\u201d of D. You might not count as selfish if you\nbenefit yourself over benefiting two other people to the same degree\neach as you benefit yourself but things may be different if seven\nother people are in the mix, and what counts as the relevant kind of\nprioritizing of oneself varies depending on whether the context\nconcerns emotional or financial selfishness, and so on. So D\nalone isn\u2019t sufficient for E, and the further\nnon-evaluative detail about particular instances of D which is\nneeded for E isn\u2019t built into the meaning of\nselfish (Burton 1992: 31). This avoids the anti-disentangling\nargument. For although E is still (contextually) separable from\nD, D won\u2019t be coextensive with selfish\nand an outsider\u2019s grasp of the extension of D won\u2019t\nbe enough for her to master how insiders apply selfish.\nSeparabilists might also have other ways of securing these benefits.\nBrent Kyle argues that Separabilists have no reason to accept an\nanalysis which inserts an explanatory relation into the content of\nthick concepts, and offers an alternative (discussed below) which also\navoids the anti-disentangling argument (Kyle 2020: 916\u201317, 923).\n\n\nSince Separabilists can deny Descriptive Equivalence, the\nanti-disentangling argument cannot establish Inseparability. But what\nis meant to constrain the selection of the non-evaluative\n\u201ccharacteristics and contexts\u201d which are needed to\ndetermine whether a thick term applies? And can these be grasped\nwithout drawing on our antecedent understanding of the thick term? If\nnot, those drawn to Thin Centralism won\u2019t be satisfied, and\nBurton\u2019s proposal will also fall short as a non-circular\nanalysis of meaning. Here we\u2019ll consider two other Separabilist\nproposals for solving these problems about how thick terms combine\nevaluative and non-evaluative information.\n\nDaniel Elstein and Thomas Hurka offer two patterns of analysis for\nthick terms as \u201csketches intended to illustrate the general\nresources the reductive view has\u201d in solving these problems\n(Elstein and Hurka 2009: 531). Each allows Separabilists to accept\nThin Centralism while explaining why an outsider to the relevant\nevaluative practice couldn\u2019t grasp the extension of a given\nthick term. Each of Elstein and Hurka\u2019s patterns of analysis\nlocates evaluation in the meanings of thick terms. On the first, the\nnon-evaluative content of a thick term is only partially specified\nwithin its meaning: its meaning specifies good-making (or bad-making)\nnon-evaluative properties of a general type, but may not specify what\nexactly these good-making properties are. An example they give is that\n\u201cx is distributively just\u201d means\n\n\nx is good, and there are properties X, Y, and\nZ (not specified) that distributions have as distributions, or\nin virtue of their distributive shape, such that x has\nX, Y, and Z, and X, Y, and Z\nmake any distribution that has them good. (Elstein and Hurka 2009:\n522)\n\n\nThis analysis separates non-evaluative description from evaluation,\nand grasping it requires grasping good. But\ngrasping the non-evaluative information that distributively\njust only applies to distributions won\u2019t be enough to know\njust which distributions fall into its extension. That requires\nknowing which properties of distributions are good making. Similarly,\nmastering how insiders apply distributively just requires\nknowing which properties they take to make distributions good. In this\nway, Separabilists can agree that \u201cevaluation drives\nextension\u201d (a phrase from Blackburn 1992; see also Gibbard\n1992). Thus they can accept the second premise of the\nanti-disentangling argument while rejecting its first premise (which\npresupposes Descriptive Equivalence).\n\nOn Elstein and Hurka\u2019s first pattern of analysis, a thick term\ninvolves only a \u201cglobal\u201d evaluation that \u201cgoverns\nthe whole concept\u201d: anything to which distributively\njust applies is good, and we can identify the general\nnon-evaluative type to which it belongs independently of any\nevaluation. Their second pattern of analysis, which is meant to fit\nmany virtue and vice concepts, supplements the global thin evaluation\nwith a further thin evaluation that is embedded within non-evaluative\ndescription. An example they give is that \u201cact x is\ncourageous\u201d means something like\n\n\nx is good, and x involves an agent\u2019s accepting\nharm or the risk of harm for himself for the sake of goods greater\nthan the evil of that harm, where this property makes any act that has\nit good. (Elstein and Hurka 2009: 527)\n\n\nThe reference to \u201cgoods\u201d is an \u201cembedded\u201d\nevaluation: you can\u2019t even specify the general type of those\nactions which courageous evaluates globally as good without\nknowing what count as good goals. But determining this will again\nrequire evaluations which an outsider cannot access simply by knowing\nthe non-evaluative content of courageous (Elstein and Hurka\n2009: 526\u20137). Note how global and embedded evaluations differ:\nyou can grasp the embedded evaluation of what count as good goals\nwithout any view on what counts as courageous (or even without having\nthe concept), but not so with the global evaluation. (To have a view\nof what property of the relevant type makes anything that has it good\nis to have a view on what counts as courageous, on their\nanalysis.) Below \u201cevaluation\u201d means global evaluation\nunless noted otherwise.\n\nBrent Kyle proposes a different way for Separabilists to avoid the\nanti-disentangling argument. According to his positive account of the\nmeaning of thick concepts, the Expansion View, thick concepts are\nexpanded contents of thin terms. An expanded content is, roughly, the\nsemantic content of a predicate with modifiers: that Chuck is ready to\nparty and that Chuck is ready for work are among the expanded contents\nthat \u201cChuck is ready\u201d can express in different contexts of\nutterance, and likewise for \u201cShaq is agile\u201d and the\nproposition that Shaq is agile for a basketball player. Kyle proposes\nthat, similarly, admirable is an expanded\ncontent of worthy, namely worthy-[of-admiration],\nthat courageous\ncan be analyzed as some such expanded\ncontent of true as true-[to-a-good-cause-despite-risk],\nand that kind\ncan be analyzed as some such expanded content\nof good as good-[to-someone-as-an-end]\n(Kyle 2020:\n918\u201322). The Expansion View contends that all thick concepts\nhave correct analyses of the sort which these rough approximations\naim to illustrate. One question about it is how to distinguish, say,\ncourageous from at least certain utterances of\nreckless in a non-circular way. Many reckless acts satisfy at\nleast the toy analysis of courageous as true-[to-a-good-cause-despite-risk].\nThe Expansion View is\na form of Separability because it requires that thick concepts are\ncomposed in part of thin ones (for details, see Kyle 2020:\n924\u201325). But it doesn\u2019t imply that any thick concept can\nbe disentangled into a thin evaluative content plus a non-evaluative\ndescription that is co-extensive with the thick concept. \n\nSeparability promises to make it clear how thick terms are both\nevaluative and descriptive. Unless we accept also Descriptive\nEquivalence, the evaluative contents of thick terms will be provided\nby independently intelligible evaluative concepts (thin concepts, or\naffective concepts, or good-in-a-way concepts), and their\nnon-evaluative meanings will be inherited from distinct non-evaluative\ninformation. Conjoining Separability with Thin Centralism would also\npromise theoretical economy: we could explicate a wide range of\nevaluative concepts on the basis of just a few basic thin concepts and\nnon-evaluative concepts which we need to recognize anyway. (This\nputative advantage assumes Inherently Evaluative. It isn\u2019t\nguaranteed by Separability as such; Kyle\u2019s Expansion View yields\na form of Separability which accepts Inherently Evaluative but\ndoesn\u2019t require Thin Centralism.) The converse won\u2019t\nfollow from Inseparabilism even if Thick Centralism is true, since\nthick terms are much more numerous than thin terms. Below we\u2019ll\ndiscuss whether Inseparabilists can provide as clear an\nexplanation.\n\nSeparability has also been claimed vital for normative criticism of\nthick concepts. Simon Blackburn claims that those who apply\ncute to adult women\n\n\nreact to an infantile, unthreatening appearance or self-presentation\nin women \u2026 with admiration or desire (the men) or envy and\nemulation (the women)\n\n\nand that we couldn\u2019t criticize this attitude as objectionable if\nthe non-evaluative aspects of cute were inseparable from the\nadmirability or enviability which those non-evaluative aspects are\ntaken to ground (Blackburn 1998: 101). In response one might point out\nthat Inseparability allows that thick terms and concepts entail\nnon-evaluative descriptions of the sort of general type that figures\nin Elstein and Hurka\u2019s analyses (\u201chas to do with\ninfantile, unthreatening appearance\u201d), so long as these\nentailments don\u2019t exhaust their descriptive aspects. This in\nturn opens up room for the specifically normative criticism that no\nspecific features of this general type make admiration or envy\nappropriate when possessed by adult women. But Inseparabilists must be\nable to square this idea with their account of how thick terms are\nevaluative. So let\u2019s now turn to Inseparability.\n",
