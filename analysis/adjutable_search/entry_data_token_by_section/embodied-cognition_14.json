A hot oven is also a cause of the\nscone\u2019s rising, but it is not a constituent of the scone. You\neat baking powder when you eat a scone, but you do not eat a hot oven.\nAccording to computational cognitive science, the constituents of a\ncognitive system are brain processes, where these processes are\nperforming computations. The causes of cognition will be whatever\ncauses these brain processes\u2014stimulation to the body from the\nenvironment, for instance. Many embodied cognition theorists believe\nthat this account of the constituents of cognition is incorrect. The\nconstituents of a cognitive system extend beyond the brain, to include\nthe body and the environment. A difficulty for this view is justifying\nthe claim that the body and world are better construed as constituents\nof cognition rather than causes. Why are they more like baking powder\nthan a hot oven?\n",
