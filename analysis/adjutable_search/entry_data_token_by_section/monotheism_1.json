    "main_text": "An Argument from God\u2019s Simplicity\n2. An Argument from God\u2019s Simplicity\n\n\nGod is often thought to be simple in the sense that each of God\u2019s\nreal properties is identical with each of his other real properties,\nand with his being or nature. For example, God\u2019s knowledge is identical\nwith his power, and both are identical with his being. Just as\n\u201cthe teacher of Plato\u201d and \u201cthe husband of\nXanthippe\u201d don\u2019t mean the same yet refer to the same individual\n(namely, Socrates), so \u201cthe wisdom of God\u201d and \u201cthe\npower of God\u201d have different meanings but refer to the same thing\n(namely, the infinitely perfect divine life or activity). If God\nis simple, however, it seems that there can be only one\ngod.\n\n\nFor consider the following argument. Suppose that there are two\nsimple beings, x and y. x has the property\nof simplicity, S, and whatever property, P, suffices\nfor identity with x. And because x is simple,\nS=P. But y, too has S. y\nmust therefore have P as well and, hence,\ny=x (Leftow, 199\u2013200).\n\n\nNotice, however, that God\u2019s simplicity is a second-order\nproperty, that is, a property of God\u2019s first-order properties such as\nwisdom, power, goodness, and the like. The doctrine of simplicity\nmay entail that God\u2019s (real) first-order properties are\nidentical. But does it entail that all of God\u2019s (real)\nsecond-order properties are identical with his (real) first order\nproperties (and thus that God\u2019s simplicity is identical with whatever\nfirst-order properties suffice for identity with God)? It isn\u2019t clear\nthat it does. Since simplicity and other divine second-order\nproperties supervene on his first-order properties, the latter entail\nthe former; nothing could instantiate each of God\u2019s (real) first-order\nproperties without instantiating such properties as simplicity. But the\nconverse may not be true. For couldn\u2019t a thing be simple in the defined\nsense (namely, having all its first-order real properties identical\nwith each other and with its being) without having the divine\nproperties? (Numbers might be an example.) If it could, then simplicity\nis not identical with the real first-order properties that suffice to\nmake God God.\n\n\nWe needn\u2019t suppose that God\u2019s second-order properties are identical\nwith his first-order properties to mount an argument from simplicity,\nhowever. Suppose that God is simple in the sense that, for any two of\nhis first-order properties, P and Q, either\nP is identical with Q or P is logically\nequivalent to Q (that is, it is impossible for him to possess\nP without possessing Q, and vice versa). Let us also\nsuppose that there are two gods. If both are God, then both possess the\nfirst-order properties essential to divinity. Call these D. If\nthe two differ, each possesses at least one first-order property which\nthe other lacks. Suppose, for example, that the first possesses a\nfirst-order property, H, and the second possesses its\ncomplement, non-H. Since each is God, each is simple. Hence,\neither H is identical with D and non-H is\nidentical with D, or H is logically equivalent to\nD and non-H is logically equivalent to D.\nTherefore, either H is identical with non-H or\nH is logically equivalent to non-H. But this is\nincoherent and, even if it were not, the possession of H and\nnon-H could not be used to distinguish the two, since either\nH and non-H are the same property or H and\nnon-H are logically equivalent properties. It therefore seems\nthat if God is simple, there can\u2019t be two gods.\n\n\nThere are at least two problems with this argument, though. First,\nthe doctrine of divine simplicity is highly controversial\u2014not\nall theists accept it. Second, even if the doctrine is accepted, the\nmost that may be required is that God\u2019s essential (real)\nproperties are either identical with each other or equivalent to each\nother. God also appears to have (real) contingent properties, however,\nand, if he does, these properties can\u2019t be identical with or equivalent\nto his essential properties. For consider the property of being the\nultimate cause of my existence or the property of knowing that I am the\nauthor of this entry. Since acting and knowing are paradigmatic cases\nof real properties, being the ultimate cause of my existence or knowing\nthat I am the author of this entry would seem to be real properties of\nGod. (Pace Thomas Aquinas and others who implausibly insist that they\naren\u2019t even though God really has them, that is, even though God really\ndoes stand in these relations to me.) But they are also\ncontingent properties of God, since there are possible worlds\nin which God exists and doesn\u2019t create me, and possible worlds in which\nGod exists but doesn\u2019t know that I am the author of this entry\n(because, for example, I never write it). Since God has his essential\nproperties in every possible world in which he exists and does not have\nhis contingent properties in every possible world in which he exists,\nhis contingent properties can\u2019t be identical with, or equivalent to,\nhis essential properties. It follows that if H and non-H are real but\ncontingent properties of two divine beings, they are neither identical\nwith nor equivalent to D. The argument from simplicity thus fails\nbecause it leaves open the possibility that two gods could be\ndistinguished by a difference in their real contingent properties.\n",
