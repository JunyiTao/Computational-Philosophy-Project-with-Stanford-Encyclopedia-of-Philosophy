    "main_text": "Preliminaries || Illustrative cases\n1.4 Illustrative cases\n\nSo far, we have considered four grounding claims, namely:\n\n[The truckers are picketing] grounds [The truckers are\nstriking].\n[The truck exists] grounds [Thus-and-so particular redness\nexists].\n[The bowl\u2019s constituent atoms are bonded in thus-and-so way]\ngrounds [The bowl is brittle].\n[The bowl is brittle], [The truckers are striking] grounds [The\nbowl is brittle and the truckers are striking].\n\n\nNow, you might think there is something to grounding, yet at the same\ntime, think that these claims aren\u2019t true. As for the second and\nfourth examples above, perhaps there are no modes or conjunctive\nfacts. But these are illustrative cases\u2014these claims, whether\ntrue or not, help communicate the relevant notion of grounding and\nthus contribute to fixing the topic of discussion. Let\u2019s try to\nget a better sense of what the range of illustrative cases looks\nlike.\n\nWhile there are perhaps different ways of usefully typing illustrative\ncases, here we focus on three categories. Importantly, this taxonomy\nisn\u2019t intended to be exhaustive, and it may be that these\ncategories aren\u2019t exclusive either. First, there are\nmetaphysical cases, cases in which entities that \\([P],\\)\n\\([P'],\\) \u2026 concern are metaphysically linked with entities\n\\([Q]\\) concerns. Our initial example of the truckers picketing is\nsuch a case. In this case, [The truckers are picketing] concerns the\nproperty of picketing, and the [The truckers are striking] concerns\nthe property of striking. Plausibly, the property of striking is a\nfunctional property (a property whose nature is exhausted by its\ncausal role), one functionally realized by the property of picketing\non this occasion (as opposed to, say, the property of engaging in a\nwork slowdown). The brittleness and mode examples look like\nmetaphysical cases as well, where mereological realization and mode\ndetermination yoke the relevant entities in these cases, respectively.\nFor other cases of this type, consider the following sentences, where\n\"{Beijing}\" refers to the set whose sole member is Beijing,\nand <The truck is red> refers to the proposition that the truck\nis red:\n\n[Beijing exists] grounds [{Beijing} exists].\n[The grains of sand exist] grounds [The heap of sand exists].\n[The truck is red] grounds [<The truck is red> is\ntrue].\n\n\nPlausibly, Beijing stands in the set formation relation to {Beijing},\nthe grains of sand compose the heap, and the truck is a truthmaker for\n<The truck is red> (i.e., the former makes the latter true).\n\nSecond, there are logical cases, grounding claims that\ncorrespond to certain logical inference rules, particularly\nintroduction rules (cf. McSweeney 2020 and Merlo 2020). Just which\nintroduction rules are relevant here will depend, in part, upon\nwhether grounding is worldly in nature (see\n \u00a72.1\n for discussion). The conjunctive case concerning the bowl being\nbrittle and the truckers striking above is such a case, which of\ncourse corresponds to conjunction introduction. For other examples,\nconsider the following two cases, which correspond to disjunction and\nexistential introduction, respectively:\n\n[The truck is red] grounds [The truck is red or the bowl is\nbrittle].\n[The truck is red] grounds [Something is red].\n\n\nThird, there are conceptual cases, grounding claims that\ncorrespond to certain conceptually necessary conditionals (cf.\nSmithson 2020). For example, you might think that it\u2019s\nconceptually necessary that if the truck is burgundy then the truck is\nred. The corresponding grounding claim:\n\n[The truck is burgundy] grounds [The truck is red].\n\n\nFor further examples of this type, consider:\n\n[Trucks are essentially artifacts] grounds [It\u2019s necessary\nthat any truck is an artifact].\n[The figure is a rectangle with sides of equal length] grounds\n[The figure is a square].\n\n\nThe thought is that it\u2019s conceptually necessary that if trucks\nare essentially artifacts, then it\u2019s necessary that any truck is\nan artifact; and it\u2019s conceptually necessary that if the figure\nis a rectangle with sides of equal length, then the figure is a\nsquare.\n\nAs mentioned above, these categories are aren\u2019t intended to be\nexclusive or exhaustive. With respective to exclusivity, the example\nof the burgundy truck above is perhaps both conceptual and\nmetaphysical, as burgundy and red stand in the\ndeterminate-determinable relation, a relation that plausibly\nunderwrites metaphysical links between properties.\n\nSo far, we\u2019ve focused on specific grounding claims (i.e., claims\nto the effect that this collection of facts grounds that fact), but\nvarious generic grounding claims are illustrative cases as well. There\nare illustrative generic grounding claims corresponding to the\nspecific grounding claims discussed above, such as:\n\nFacts concerning the instantiation of determinate properties\nground facts concerning the instantiation of determinable\nproperties.\n\n\nHere\u2019s another example, one not connected to any specific\ngrounding claim we have discussed so far:\n\nChemical facts ground biological facts.\n\n\nThis last example speaks to the idea that grounding relations between\ndifferent kinds of facts are that in virtue of which the world has a\nlayered structure (see\n \u00a73.2\n for related discussion).\n",
