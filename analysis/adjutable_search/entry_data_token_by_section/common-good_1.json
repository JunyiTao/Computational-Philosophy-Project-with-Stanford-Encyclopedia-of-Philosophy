    "main_text": "Second Contrast: Public Goods\n2. Second Contrast: Public Goods\n\nAnother important contrast to draw is between the common good and a\npublic good. In economic theory, a public good is a particular type of\ngood that members of a community would not possess if they were each\nmotivated only by their own\n self-interest.[4]\n Here is an example. Imagine that the residents in a town could enjoy\na mosquito free summer if most every resident treats her lawn with a\nbug spray. The spray costs money, but every resident would be better\noff having paid for the spray and enjoying life without mosquitoes. If\nmost every resident sprays her lawn, everyone in the town will enjoy\nthe benefit, even those residents who do not spray their lawns. But\nthere is no feasible way to exclude the nonsprayers from enjoying the\nbenefit.\n\nThe problem posed by a public good is that the optimal course of\naction for each individual, from the standpoint of her egoistic\nrationality, is for her not to contribute to the provision of the\ngood, even though everyone would be better off if they all did so (see\nOlson 1965). Take any resident in the town I just described. From the\nstandpoint of her own self-interest, she should not spray her lawn: If\nthe other residents spray their lawns, she would get the benefit\nwithout paying the cost. And if the other residents do not spray their\nlawns, she would save herself the cost of spraying her lawn. It\nfollows that as long as residents are moved only by their own\nself-interest, they will not produce the good of a mosquito free\nsummer.\n\nIn both academic and nonacademic discussions, people often confuse the\ncommon good with a public good or a set of public goods. But it is\nimportant to keep the two ideas distinct. The facilities that make up\nthe common good resemble public goods because they are often\nfacilities that are supposed to be open and available to everyone\n(e.g., a public library). This means that it is not possible to\nexclude those who do not contribute from enjoying the benefits.\nNonetheless, the facilities that make up the common good are\nconceptually different from public goods because these facilities may\nnot be a net benefit for each member of the community. The facilities\nthat make up the common good serve a special class of\ninterests that all citizens have in common, i.e., the interests that\nare the object of the civic relationship. But each citizen will have\nvarious private interests in addition to these common interests, so\nfor any particular citizen, the private interests affected by some\nfacility may be more important from the standpoint of her egoistic\nrationality than the interests that belong to the special class of\ncommon interests. As such, the facility may not be a net benefit to\nher.\n\nConsider the case of a public library. Suppose that a certain library\nis part of the common good in a political community because it serves\nan interest in the privileged class of common interests. Suppose the\nrelevant interest is an interest in guaranteed access to the\nstorehouse of human knowledge. Some individual X owns a\nbakery. Her bakery is profitable, but it would be even more profitable\nif people were not able to read certain cookbooks at the library and\nso could not make her carrot muffins at home. X has an interest\nin guaranteed access to the storehouse of human knowledge, but she\nalso has an interest in her bakery\u2019s profitability. If her\nprivate interest in a muffin monopoly is more important from her\negoistic perspective than her interest in guaranteed access to the\nstorehouse of human knowledge, then she is actually worse off because\nof the public\n library.[5]\n In this case, the public library is part of\nthe common good, but it is not a public good because there is someone\nin the community who is worse off in virtue of the library\u2019s\nexistence.\n\nBefore moving on, note that people sometimes use \u201cthe\npublic good\u201d to refer to something other than the technical\nnotion of a public good in economic theory. In academic and\nnonacademic discussions, people sometimes use \u201cthe public\ngood\u201d in a way that is more or less synonymous with \u201cthe\ncommon good\u201d. This use of the term was especially prevalent\namong political philosophers, roughly from the 16th century\nto the 19th century. For example, in the Second Treatise of\nGovernment (1698), John Locke defines political\npower as the right to make binding laws and the right to mobilize the\ncommunity in defense of these laws, where both of these powers are\n\n\n\nto be directed to no other end, but the Peace,\nSafety, and publick good of the People. (1698 [1988:\n353]). \n\n\nHere Locke uses the term \u201cpublic good\u201d to refer to\ninterests that are common to all members of a political community\n(e.g., the interest in bodily security and property), where members\nhave a relational obligation to care for these common interests. The\n\u201cpublic good\u201d in this sense basically refers to the common\ngood, though philosophers who use the term \u201cpublic good\u201d\ntypically favor a thinner conception of the political relationship and\na more limited view of the powers of government.\n",
