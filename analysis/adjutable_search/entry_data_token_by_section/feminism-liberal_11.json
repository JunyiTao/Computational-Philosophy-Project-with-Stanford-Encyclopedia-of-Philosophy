    "main_text": "Classical-Liberal Feminism || Justification\n2.6 Criticism\n\nSome criticism of classical-liberal feminism addresses the\nconsequentialist argument offered in support of classical-liberal\nfeminism. The consequentialist argument says that the political\narrangements recommended by classical-liberalism, as compared with the\nalternatives, will provide women with more of what is good for them\n(see\n \u00a72.5).\n Following Ashlie Warnick, we can distinguish the claim that\nparticular liberty-restricting policies are bad for women (and that\nsome liberty-enhancing policies are good for women) from the claim\nthat all liberty-restricting policies harm women, or that a minimal\nstate (or no state) would be better for women overall (Warnick 2003).\nIt is surely possible to cite liberty-restricting policies that are\nbad for women\u2014laws limiting women\u2019s employment\noptions\u2014and thus to cite liberty-enhancing policies that are\ngood for women\u2014not having such laws. But it is also possible to\ncite liberty-restricting policies that are good for women\u2014for\nexample the legal prohibition against sex discrimination in\nemployment, education, and public accommodations (which\nclassical-liberal feminists recommend dismantling (see\n \u00a72.4)).\n Of course, if sex discrimination is rare, as some classical-liberal\nfeminists contend (see\n \u00a72.2.1),\n laws prohibiting it will not produce much benefit. But, as\negalitarian-liberal feminists Deborah Rhode and Ann Cudd argue, sex\ndiscrimination remains a significant problem (Rhode 1997: 156; Cudd\n2006: 140\u2013142). Think also of the classical-liberal feminist\nrecommendation that women and men be treated exactly the same by the\nstate (see\n \u00a72.1\n and\n \u00a72.4).\n While different treatment can stigmatize and entrench stereotypes,\nsame treatment can disadvantage women if they are not similarly\nsituated to men\u2014which, arguably, is the case (Minow 1990). So\nthe larger case\u2014that all liberty-restricting policies harm\nwomen, or that a minimal state (or no state) would be better for women\noverall\u2014has not been made convincingly (Warnick 2003). Another\nconcern about the larger case is that much of the support offered is\nspeculative, for example Roderick Long\u2019s assertion that\n\u201cthe explosion of prosperity\u201d classical liberal\narrangements would bring about \u201dwould go a long way toward\nproviding women with an economic safety net more effective than any\ngovernment welfare program\u201d (Long 1997\u2014see\n Other Internet Resources).\n\nSome criticism addresses non-consequentialist arguments for\nclassical-liberal feminism. These arguments say that, regardless of\nthe consequences, women and men should be treated as self-owners with\nrights to property justly acquired and to freedom from coercive\ninterference because this is what they deserve as ends in themselves,\nbecause this is what insight into natural law teaches, or because this\nis what their perfection requires (see\n \u00a72.5).\n Critics contend that even if we concede the relevant\nclassical-liberal premises\u2014that women and men should be treated\nin ways they deserve as ends in themselves, or as natural law teaches,\nor in ways their perfection requires\u2014it does not follow that the\nstate should treat individuals merely as self-owners entitled only to\nproperty justly acquired and freedom from coercive interference. For\nexample, egalitarian-liberal feminism suggests that treating\nindividuals as ends in themselves requires legal measures to protect\nwomen\u2019s personal and political autonomy\u2014measures such as\nanti-discrimination law, workplace changes to accommodate caregiving\nresponsibilities, and adequate material means (see\n \u00a71.1.4\n and\n \u00a71.2.1).\n Since classical-liberal feminism rejects such measures,\negalitarian-liberal feminism suggests that it fails to treat women as\nends in themselves. Also, that treating individuals as ends in\nthemselves means treating them as entitled merely to protection from\ncoercive interference is plausible only if one ignores the fact of\nhuman dependency. By the fact of human dependency is meant the fact\nthat all human beings are utterly dependent on the caregiving of\nothers for many years at the start of life, that many come to need the\ncaregiving of others due to temporary or permanent disability later in\nlife, and that many require caregiving when they become infirm at the\nend of life; and also, that those who provide caregiving for those who\ncannot care for themselves become dependent on others for support\n(Kittay 1995: 10). If human beings are dependent in these ways, then\ntreating them as ends in themselves will, at least for some of the\ntime, mean something other than merely leaving them alone. Failure to\nrecognize this suggests that classical-liberal feminism assumes that\nthere is a nonpolitical \u201crealm of private life in which the\nreproductive and nurturant needs of human beings are taken care\nof\u201d (Okin 1989: 75). Such an assumption makes it impossible to\nevaluate the justice of the arrangements under which caregiving is\ngiven and received and removes from our consideration the nature of\nobligations to, and entitlements of, members of society who require\ncaregiving to survive and thrive. Some worry that one form of\nclassical liberalism\u2014libertarianism\u2014seriously\nmisunderstands the political relevance of caregiving because it\nconstrues one key caregiving arrangement, the parent-child\nrelationship, as one of ownership (see Okin 1989: 80\u201385; see\nalso Nozick 1974; Andersson 2007; and Jeske 1996). As Jennifer Roback\nMorse, herself a libertarian puts it: \u201dI think it is well to\nadmit\u2026 that our inattention to family life and community\nresponsibility has left libertarians open to the charge that we do not\ncare very much about these matters\u201d (Morse 2001: 28).\n",
