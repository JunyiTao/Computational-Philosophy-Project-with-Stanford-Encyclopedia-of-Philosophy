    "main_text": "The Neo-Confucian Era || Factions and Political Independence\n4.1 Factions and Political Independence\n\nWilliam de Bary, one of the most influential Western scholars of\nNeo-Confucianism, has said an important \u201ctrouble with\nConfucianism\u201d is that it imposed tremendous moral demands on the\nConfucian superior person (junzi) without providing the\npolitical power to fulfill them. The superior person shoulders the\nresponsibility of cultivating humane monarchs and fashioning social\nand political institutions that work for the public weal, but\nConfucians are also committed to a system that gives superior people\nvery little leverage with which to accomplish these herculean tasks.\nThey deprive themselves of this leverage in various ways, some of them\nobvious (Confucianism embraces powerful and largely unchecked\nmonarchical government) and some of them subtle. One of the ways of\nundermining Confucians\u2019 own power is by refusing to pander to\nspecific constituencies or factions, standing on the side of the right\nand the public good rather than with allies or friends of convenience.\nTheir weakness, de Bary argues, is\n\n\nin their indisposition or inability to establish any power base of\ntheir own.\u2026 [E]xcept on rare, momentary occasions, they faced\nthe state, and whoever controlled it in the imperial court, as\nindividual scholars unsupported by an organized party or active\nconstituency. (de Bary 1991: 49)\n\n\nIndeed, there is no question that the role of the Confucian minister\nis complex and often vexed. This section highlights one of its key\ndimensions.\n\nLet us start with some context. From late-classical times down into\nthe early Song, the term \u201cfaction\u201d (pengdang) was\ninvariably derogatory, referring to associations of \u201cpetty\npeople\u201d who aimed to use their roles in government to further\ntheir own, selfish ends. There is a certain degree of support for this\nunderstanding of \u201cfaction\u201d in even earlier texts, but it\nis significant for our purposes that some passages in early texts like\nConfucius\u2019s Analects also suggest that superior people\n(junzi) can form associations, so long as they do not act in\npartisan ways (Levine 2008: 25\u20136 and 34\u20135; LY 12:24). A\nkey question that emerges in the midst of the political and\nintellectual wrangling of the Northern Song is whether horizontal\naffiliations among equals are in any way appropriate, or whether the\nonly axis of loyalty is the vertical one, from individuals upward to\nthe ruler (and beyond, to the Way or to cosmic Pattern\ntianli]).\n\nWe can identify three different positions on this question. The most\ncommon is the long-held view that factions and factionalism are the\nexclusive domains of the self-centered; superior people, in contrast,\nare individually loyal. The radical alternative to this was the claim,\nmade most forcefully by Ouyang Xiu (1007\u20131072), that genuine\nfactions\u2014which he understands as long-lasting associations\norganized collectively to pursue the common good\u2014are only formed\nby superior people. The affiliations of petty people are only\ntemporary, for personal gain (Levine 2008: 47\u201356; Ouyang\u2019s\nessay is translated in de Bary and Bloom 1999). Crucially, Ouyang adds\nthat genuinely superior people will unite around a shared Way\n(tongdao), so disputatiousness at the ruler\u2019s court is\ninevitably seen as sign of self-centeredness. Finally, a third\nposition agrees with the first in using \u201cfaction\u201d as a\nterm for selfish associations that ignore the common good, but agrees\nwith the second view that superior people can and should collaborate\nwith one another for their mutual edification: \u201cWhen superior\npeople cultivate themselves and regulate their heartminds, their Way\nis one of collaboration with others\u201d (Levine 2008: 58). So,\naccording to this third position, while superior people should not\nengage in factional wrangling at court, they should work together to\ncultivate themselves and pursue the common good.\n\nWhat, then, should be done about factions in practice, and about\nministerial disagreement more generally? Again, there are three main\npositions. Those who believe that superior people should be\nindividually loyal tend to argue that the ruler should try to wipe out\nall factions. One strong argument for this view maintains that even if\nthere is a faction of superior people, they will be outnumbered by\nfactions of the selfish; factionalism itself is destructive, so should\nbe rooted out (Levine 2008: 46\u20137). Ouyang Xiu\u2019s radical\nview holds that the true faction of superior people can be identified\nas such, and their one voice\u2014which, after all, is unified around\npursuit of the common good\u2014should be heeded. False factions of\npetty people should be suppressed. The third view, finally,\nacknowledges that factionalism seems inevitable and calls for a strong\nand wise ruler who is able to encourage vertical loyalty and to judge\namong the competing ministerial arguments. By relying on the ruler in\nthis way, this third view is able consistently to maintain that\nsuperior people need not themselves form ministerial factions, even\nthough they should collaborate to encourage mutual ethical\ndevelopment.\n\nIn his own day, Ouyang Xiu\u2019s radical view fails to win out, but\nover time the idea that there is one genuine faction becomes\nwidespread within Neo-Confucianism. Zhu Xi encourages his\ncontemporaries to support the formation of such a \u201cfaction of\nsuperior people\u201d, to join it themselves, and even to see that\nthe emperor himself becomes part of this faction. For Zhu, it is this\nfaction of superior people\u2014those who have grasped the\n\u201csuccession of the Way\u201d\u2014who have the ultimate\nlegitimacy in society, thus even the emperor needs to be properly\neducated so that he can strive to join this group. Zhu is also\nexplicit that it is crucial to maintain the ethical purity of those in\nthe faction; \u201cif there are those who are wicked and evil, then\nyou ought to expel them completely\u201d (WJ vol. 21, p. 1244).\nSimilar views can be found among the leaders of\nNeo-Confucianism\u2019s most famous faction, the Donglin. This\nlate-Ming dynasty movement is multi-faceted, including a broad ethical\nrevitalization movement, a national Confucian \u201cmoral\nfellowship\u201d, and a ministerial faction in Beijing; the whole\nmovement takes its name from its institutional base in the privately\nfunded Donglin Academy in southern China (Dardess 2002). The Donglin\nfaction goes to extreme lengths to promote its cause, driven by its\nmembers\u2019 conviction that theirs is a battle of the good and\npublic-spirited against the evil and self-centered. Donglin partisans\ncontribute to a toxic political atmosphere in which each side\ndemonizes its opponents. The crucial moment in the struggle comes when\na Donglin figure issues a public document explicitly accusing a\nleading palace figure of gross immorality. In a modern scholar\u2019s\nwords, this document is written in the \u201clanguage of moral\nterrorism\u201d: language that is uncompromising, \u201cheated to\nthe highest possible degree of emotional incandescence\u201d (Dardess\n2002: 71). Not long after this comes a violent backlash in which key\nDonglin figures are arrested, tortured, and killed, the academy razed,\nand the movement crushed.\n\nReflecting on Neo-Confucian ideas of faction, three observations are\nin order. First, returning to de Bary\u2019s conception of the\n\u201ctrouble with Confucianism\u201d with which we began this\nsection, Neo-Confucian principles make it difficult for proper\nConfucian ministers to establish a power-base of their own, in part\nbecause they are not supposed to have special commitments or loyalties\nto groups. Second, even if the primary axis of loyalty is vertical (to\nthe emperor, public good, and more abstract notions like the Way),\nhorizontal solidarity fits very well with key aspects of Neo-Confucian\nviews of self-cultivation, such as the part that one\u2019s community\nplays in developing an ethical \u201ccommitment\u201d. In this\nlight, and given the excesses to which the \u201cone true\nfaction\u201d view can lead, it is tempting to conclude that the\nthird view of factions described above is most attractive. Finally,\nrecent scholars have disagreed about the significance of Neo-Confucian\nviews of faction. One opines that\n\n\nhad Confucian gentry been able to transmit their local influence to\nthe provincial and national levels through legitimized factional\norganizations such as the Donglin academy, it is interesting to\nspeculate what sorts of political forces would have been released into\nConfucian political culture;\n\n\nhe goes on to suggest a parallel to \u201cthe trend against\nabsolutist monarchy and toward parliamentary rule in the West\u201d\n(Elman 1989: 389). In contrast, another scholar argues that\n\n\nthe Donglin affair was no harbinger of some possible future\nparliamentarian democracy. Donglin Confucian thought was monarchical\nand authoritarian to its core. (Dardess 2002: 7)\n\n",
