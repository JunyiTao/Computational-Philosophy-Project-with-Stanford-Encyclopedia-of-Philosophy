    "main_text": "The Problem\n1. The Problem\n\nThree intuitions are at stake in the nonidentity problem. (1) The\nfirst is the person-affecting, or person-based,\nintuition itself. According to that intuition, an act can be\nwrong only if that act makes things worse for, or\n(we can say) harms, some existing or future person. Acts, in\nother words, that maximize wellbeing for each and every\nexisting or future person cannot be wrong. As Parfit put it: the\n\u201cbad\u201d act must be \u201cbad for\u201d someone (Parfit\n1987, 363).\n\n(2) The second intuition is that an act that confers on a person an\nexistence that is, though flawed, worth having in a case in which that\nsame person could never have existed at all in the absence of that\nact does not make things worse for, or harm, and is not\n\u201cbad for,\u201d that person. In other words, conferring the\nexistence that is unavoidably flawed and yet not so flawed\nthat it is less than worth having does not make things worse\nfor, or harm, and is not \u201cbad for,\u201d the person whose\nexistence it is. \n\n(3) The third intuition is what the nonidentity cases themselves seem\nclearly to show: that the existence-inducing acts under scrutiny in\nthe various nonidentity cases are in fact wrong.\n\nAnalogous intuitions similarly collide when our question is whether a\ngiven world is, all things considered, morally worse than another.\n\n\nSince the nonidentity problem became well-known through the work of\nDerek Parfit, James Woodward and Gregory Kavka in the early 1980s,\nmost philosophers have accepted it as showing that at least one of the\naforementioned intuitions must be false. Here, the most frequently\nidentified culprit is intuition (1), that is, the person-based\nintuition. But if that intuition is false, then the question is raised\nwhether morality should be understood to have a structure that is\nimpersonal at least in part. Does moral law, that is, provide\nthat agents on occasion do wrong even though they have at the same\ntime successfully maximized wellbeing for each person who\ndoes or ever will exist?\n\nIf we answer this question in the affirmative, we must of course then\ntake up the challenge of explaining just how acts that make things\nworse for no one can be wrong. Classical utilitarians think we can\nmeet this challenge with ease. They would quickly agree that the\nperson-based intuition is false and could indeed put that fact forward\nto bolster their position that moral law is impersonal in nature and\nthat aggregating wellbeing levels across particular populations at the\nrelevant worlds is exactly the right way to determine whether an act\nis permissible or one world is better than another. Some\nnon-consequentialists might also be happy to accept the result that\nthe person-based intuition is false. They might consider that result\nto support their position that wrongdoing must be grounded in facts\nabout the agent\u2019s character, motives or intentions and not in\nthe consequences the act under scrutiny generates for any particular\nperson. Still other impersonalists \u2013 philosophers, for example,\nwho reject classical utilitarianism (perhaps on the ground that it\nleads to the repugnant conclusion; see the entry on the\n repugnant conclusion)\n but remain compelled by the idea that acts, as opposed to agents, are\nto be evaluated in light of their consequences \u2013 face a more\nserious challenge. They must identify a \u201cTheory X\u201d (Parfit\n1987, 378) that accounts for the wrongdoing within a consequentialist\nframework but does not bring to bear either the principles of\nclassical utilitarianism or any pre-analytic sense we think we have\nthat the choice under scrutiny has made things worse for, or harmed,\nor failed to maximize wellbeing for, the people who have been made to\nsuffer by that wrong choice.\n\nIt is hard to appreciate the importance of the nonidentity problem\nuntil one understands its sweep. It isn\u2019t just close-to-home\nchoices relating to procreation \u2013 for example, the choice to\nconceive a child with one person rather than another \u2013 that seem\nsusceptible to the nonidentity analysis. For that narrow range of\ncases, the exculpatory implication from intuitions (1) and (2) might\nseem perfectly on target and the rejection of intuition (3) at least\nplausible. Thus: was it wrong for my parents to choose to have a child\nwith each other rather than each to have a child with some alternate\npartner who (let\u2019s suppose) would have brought to the table a\nsuperior genetic contribution? We might think that it wasn\u2019t.\nEven if I suffer from being less tall, strong, smart or healthy than\nalternate children my parents could have produced with alternate\npartners in my place, my existence remains worth having. Moreover,\nthere is nothing they or anyone else \u2013 consistent with existing\nmedical and genetic technologies \u2013 could have done to bring\nme into a better existence. If in that case an intuitive,\nperson-based moral theory instructs that no wrong has been done, that\nresult might well seem plausible to us. The case might not, that is,\nstrike us as a convincing counterexample against the person-based\nintuition itself. \n\nIt is when we realize that the exculpatory implication applies not\njust to close-to-home cases of procreative choice but also to a\ndisturbingly large segment of all our future-directed choices\n\u2013 including choices that don\u2019t seem on the face of things\nto have anything to do with whether one person is brought into\nexistence rather than another \u2013 that we begin to appreciate the\nsignificance of the nonidentity problem. In at least some of those\ncases, we are (likely) going to find intuition (3) itself compelling;\nwe are (likely) going to be convinced \u2013 as we shall see \u2013\nthat the choice under scrutiny is clearly wrong. We will then seem\nforced to abandon either intuition (1) or (2). If it\u2019s the\nformer we let go of rather than the latter, then our challenge is to\naccount for the fact that the choice is wrong despite the\nfact that same choice seems to be good for \u2013 indeed\nmaximizing for \u2013 each and every existing and future\nperson. If it\u2019s the latter, then our challenge is to explain how\na choice can make things worse for, or harm, or in some way be\nbad for, a given person despite the fact that\nit is maximizing for that person.\n",
