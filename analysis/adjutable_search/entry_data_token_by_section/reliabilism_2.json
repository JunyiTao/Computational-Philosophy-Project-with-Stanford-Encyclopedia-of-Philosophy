    "main_text": "A Paradigm Shift in Analytic Epistemology || Justified vs. Unjustified Beliefs: Some Examples\n1.2 Justified vs. Unjustified Beliefs: Some Examples\n\nIs it true, as process reliabilism claims, that beliefs formed by\nreliable processes are (intuitively) considered justified and that\nbeliefs formed by unreliable processes are (intuitively) considered\nunjustified? Here are some examples of processes that frequently lead\nto false beliefs: wishful thinking, reliance on emotional attachment,\nmere hunch or guesswork, and hasty generalization. Beliefs produced by\nsuch processes would all be considered, intuitively, unjustified. So\nthere is a high correlation between process-unreliability and\nunjustifiedness. Similarly, here are some examples of processes that\ncommonly lead to true beliefs: standard perceptual processes, good\nreasoning, and introspection. Here again there is a strong correlation\nbetween process-reliability and justified belief.\n\nWe should notice, of course, that justifiedness is not a purely\ncategorial concept. We can and do regard certain beliefs as more\ncertain and more justified than others. Furthermore, our intuitions of\ncomparative justifiedness go along with our beliefs about the\ncomparative reliability of the belief-causing processes (Goldman 1979;\n1986: 103\u20134; 1992; 2008). This comports well with process\nreliabilism.\n",
