The norms\nare typically construed as norms of action, most commonly as\nprescriptions, but could also be construed axiologically. That is, the\nclaim need not be that the relevant norms guide our use of concepts,\nbut could just be that it is a property essential to their having\ncontent that certain mental states (true beliefs, for instance) are\nvaluable.\n\nAs in the case of meaning, we may distinguish between more or less\ndirect arguments. One way to provide a direct argument for CE\nnormativity would be to proceed from the notion of correctness\nconditions, in analogy with the simple argument (Boghossian 2003: 85).\nJust as meaningful expressions have correctness conditions\nessentially, along the lines of\n (CM),\n so do concepts: The concept green, for instance, applies to\nan object \\(x\\) if and only if \\(x\\) is green. However, unlike in the\ncase of (CM), the application relation here is just that between a\nconcept and the objects that \u201cfall under\u201d it. For\nnormativity to enter some connection has to be made with the subject\nwho employs the concepts, with her mental states.\n\nThe standard normativist strategy consists in appealing to the use of\nconcepts in propositional attitudes, and to derive the normativity of\ncontent from that of the propositional attitudes. We shall consider\ntwo such common arguments: one that goes via the nature of belief, and\none that goes via ideas about concept grasp.\n3.1.1 The Argument from Belief\n\nThe argument from belief proceeds in two steps: It is argued, first,\nthat belief is essentially normative, and second, that there is an\nessential connection between belief and content such that if belief is\nessentially normative it follows that content is, too. Our main\nconcern here is not with the normativity of belief, but some comments\nconcerning the first step are required.\n\nAccording to the most common proposal, the normativity of belief\nderives from the connection between belief and truth. The proposal is\nnot merely that beliefs, essentially, have contents that are true or\nfalse, but that beliefs, by their very nature, generate a normative\nrequirement that establishes that they are correct or incorrect as a\nresult of their content being true or false. Such a requirement is\ndistinctive of belief and provides a \u201cdecisive reason\u201d for\nhaving or not having a particular belief (Wedgwood, 2002: 268. See\nalso Velleman 2000; Engel 2001, 2013; Noordhof 2021; Wedgwood 2007,\n2013; Boghossian 2003; Gibbard 2003, 2005, 2012; Shah 2003; Speaks\n2009; Nolfi 2015; Fassio 2016).\n\nIn response, it has been argued that what is essential to belief is\nmerely that beliefs have contents that are true or false, not that one\nought to believe a content if and only if it is true. The appearance\nof normativity, it is suggested, derives from other sources. For\ninstance, as epistemic agents, we seek truth. And having true beliefs\nis essential to fulfilling our goals. This just shows that true\nbeliefs have an instrumental value, and fails to support the\nnormativity of belief thesis. Moreover, it is argued, even if it is\nclaimed that truth has a non-instrumental value, the value in question\nis derived from moral or other values, not from the nature of belief\nas such (Papineau & Tanney 1999, 2013; Dretske 2000; Davidson\n2001a; Horwich 2013; Bergamaschi Ganapini 2021).\n\nQuestions have also been raised concerning how the norm of belief is\nto be understood. With respect to meaning the question arose whether\n \\((\\ME_1)\\)\n violates the principle that ought implies can. In\nthe case of belief, a similar worry arises if the norm of belief is\nformulated in a parallel fashion, by proceeding from the correctness\nconditions of beliefs to normative consequences:\n\n(CB)\nThe belief that \\(p\\) is correct if and only if \\(p\\).\n\\((\\NB_1)\\)\n\\( S\\) ought to believe that \\(p\\) if and only if \\(p\\).\n\n\nThe trouble is that\n \\((\\NB_1)\\)\n implies that \\(S\\) ought to believe everything that is true, an\nimpossible task. This difficulty, it has been argued, is not solved by\nappealing to a wide-scope reading of \u201cought\u201d since there\nare values of \\(p\\) that are such that \\(S\\) could neither bring it\nabout that \\(p\\) is false, nor bring it about that she believes \\(p\\)\n(Bykvist & Hattiangadi 2007:\n 284).[45]\n The most common reaction, instead, is to weaken the norm (Boghossian\n2003: 37):\n\n\\((\\NB_2)\\)\n\\( S\\) ought to believe that \\(p\\) only if \\(p\\).\n\n\nThis norm does not imply that \\(S\\) ought to believe everything that\nis true, and hence does not put impossible demands on \\(S\\). However,\nas noted in the discussion of\n \\((\\ME_1)\\)\n above, the question arises whether \\((\\NB_2)\\) suffices to provide\nany real constraints on \\(S\\)\u2018s belief formation. If \\(p\\) is\ntrue it does not follow that \\(S\\) ought to believe \\(p\\), and if\n\\(p\\) is false it merely follows that it is not the case that \\(S\\)\nought to believe \\(p\\)\u2014not that \\(S\\) ought not to believe \\(p\\)\n(Bykvist & Hattiangadi 2007:\n 280).[46]\n In response, normativists have made the same move as in the case of\nmeaning, and suggested that the \u201cought\u201d in\n \\((\\NB_1)\\)\n is replaced with a \u201cmay\u201d (Whiting 2010: 216\u2013217;\n2013: 125). It has been objected that this is too weak since it\nundermines the fundamental role of the norm of truth when it comes to\nexplaining other evidential and inferential norms (Bykvist &\nHattiangadi 2013: 113\u2013114) and to accounting for some key\nfeature of doxastic deliberation (Sullivan-Bissett & Noordhof\n 2020).[47]\n\nAdopting a different tack the normativist could say that the relevant\nnorms should be understood in terms of the \u201ctelos\u201d of\nbelief: Just as a map is a map (giving a correct or incorrect picture\nof the world) only insofar as it is designed to represent the world,\nand in this sense ought to represent the world correctly, so a belief\ncan be said to be correct or incorrect only insofar as representing\nthe world belongs to its telos, to what it ought to do. Since this\ntype of \u201cought\u201d applies to the representing objects (such\nas maps or beliefs) and not to agents, it is argued, they are not\naction-guiding and the principle that ought implies\ncan does not apply (Jarvis\n 2012).[48]\n\nAnother set of questions concerns the fact that\n \\((\\NB_1)\\)\n is an objective\n norm.[49]\n Unlike a subjective norm, such as \u201c\\(S\\) ought to believe that\n\\(p\\) only if \\(S\\) has evidence for \\(p\\)\u201d, \\((\\NB_1)\\) does\nnot engage with \\(S\\)\u2018s reasons, her beliefs and desires, and\nthis raises the question of how \\((\\NB_1)\\) can serve to guide our\nbelief formation. Objective norms can guide only via our beliefs, and\nit has been argued that this raises two worries for \\((\\NB_1\\)). In\norder to be guided by \\((\\NB_1\\)), \\(S\\) would have to have a belief\nabout whether \\(p\\) is true. This means, first, that in order to be\nguided by \\((\\NB_1\\)) the subject would already have had to form a\nbelief as to whether \\(p\\) and hence the guidance comes too late; and,\nsecond, that whatever conclusion the subject comes to as to whether\n\\(p\\), the norm tells her to hold that very belief (if she forms the\nbelief that \\(p\\) the norm gives her a reason to believe \\(p\\) and if\nshe forms the belief that not-\\(p\\) the norm gives her a reason to\nbelieve not-\\(p\\)) (Gl\u00fcer & Wikforss 2009:\n 44).[50]\n It is therefore disputed whether \\((\\NB_1)\\) can be said to be a norm\nof belief, regulating our belief\n formation.[51]\n\nAnother key challenge to the idea that belief is essentially normative\nis that belief seems to be subject to multiple normative standards. In\naddition to the idea that one should only believe what is true or\nfollow the evidence, there are now also several arguments for the\nclaim that at times pragmatic and moral norms govern belief as well\nand these may be normatively heavier than any epistemic norm at play\n(Maru\u0161i\u0107 2011; Reisner 2018; Basu 201; Leary 2017; Rinard\n2019) . If so, then there are no essential or constitutive normative\nrequirements for belief: though there might be distinctive correctness\nconditions for belief (as in CB) these do not appear to be genuinely\nnormative or do not seem to explain what \u201cone just plain\nought\u201d to believe such and such (Maguire & Woods 2020;\nBergamaschi Ganapini 2021).\n\nFinally, assuming that belief is intrinsically normative,\nhowever, the decisive question is whether this has any implications\nfor content. Why should the fact that belief is normative imply that\ncontent is? Indeed, it has been suggested that the opposite is true\nsince if belief is normative the appearance of normativity of content\ncan simply be explained by appealing to the normativity of belief\n(Speaks 2009: 409). According to Boghossian, the normativity of\ncontent derives from the fact that there is a constitutive connection\nbetween the notion of content and the notion of belief (Boghossian\n2003). This is so, he argues, since we could not grasp the notion of\ncontent without first grasping the role contents play in belief.\nMoreover, Boghossian argues, although contents play a role in other\nattitudes as well, there are reasons to think that the concept of\nbelief is conceptually primary: For instance, \\(S\\) could not have the\nconcept of desire without first having the concept of belief (2003:\n42\u201343). If so, the normativity of belief supports CE\nnormativity.\n\nThe claim that the concept of belief is primary to that of desire can\nbe questioned. Thus, there is empirical evidence from developmental\npsychology that children acquire the concept of desire prior to\nacquiring that of belief (Wellman 1993). It has also been argued that\nbelief and desire are conceptually interdependent (Miller 2008). More\nimportantly, even if it can be shown that the concept of belief is\nprimary to that of desire, and of the other propositional attitudes,\nthe question arises whether indeed one could not grasp the concept of\ncontent without grasping that of belief. Prima facie,\ngrasping the concept of a propositional attitude such as belief is\nrather distinct from grasping the concept of content, since it\ninvolves the idea of taking up an attitude towards\n content.[52]\n Moreover, Boghossian is committed to the strong claim that opponents\nof content normativity fail to grasp the concept of content (or,\nalternatively, that they operate with a different concept).\n\nAn alternative strategy would be to avoid the appeal to conceptual\nentailments and argue that there is a metaphysical connection between\nmental content and belief such that if belief is essentially\nnormative, content is. Such an argument may be more or less direct,\ngoing via more or less contentious assumptions about mental\n content.[53]\n\nFor instance, versions of conceptual role semantics imply that there\nis an essential link between mental content and belief as do versions\nof informational theories of content (Dretske 1981; Fodor 1990),\nalthough the latter are typically coupled with a non-normativist\naccount of belief. Another line of reasoning appeals to the idea that\nthere is a constitutive connection between grasping a concept,\nunderstanding a content, and using it in the propositional\nattitudes.\n3.1.2 Use in Keeping with Content\n\nTo possess a concept, it is sometimes suggested, is to have the\ncapacity to use the concept in various propositional attitudes. Since\nit is essential to the propositional attitudes that they stand in\ncertain rational interconnections with one another, it is argued, this\nessential normativity transfers to concepts and contents. Possessing a\nconcept, grasping it, incurs a commitment to use the concept \u201cin\nkeeping with its content\u201d, in the various propositional\nattitudes. If the speaker fails to do so, she has misused the\nconcept in question (Millar 2004; McDowell & Pettit 1986; Gibbard\n2012: chapter 6).\n\nThis argument runs parallel to the argument from understanding in\nsupport of ME normativity\n (section 2.1.2).\n Even if that argument is accepted, however, the question arises\nwhether it can be applied to concepts and content, since the notion of\nfailing to use a concept in \u201ckeeping with its content\u201d\nappears more problematic than the notion of failing to use a word in\naccordance with its meaning (McGinn 1984: 146\u2013147; Millar 2004:\n180\u2013181). It is relatively unproblematic to speak of\nunderstanding the meaning of an expression (or misunderstanding it),\nbut in the case of concepts there is nothing corresponding to the\nexpression. To \u201cunderstand\u201d a concept is simply to possess\nit, to use it in thoughts. Hence there seems to be little or no room\nfor the idea that \\(S\\) misunderstands a concept either. If \\(S\\)\nreasons as if she possesses the concept ancient rather than\nthe concept arcane, it would seem to follow not that there is\nany misuse of concepts but that she has another concept.\n\nOne strategy is to distinguish between possession conditions and\nattribution conditions (Peacocke 1992: 27\u201333). This separates\nthe conditions that determine \\(S\\)\u2019s concepts from conditions\nfor the attribution of the concept to \\(S\\). As a consequence, there\nis a potential gap between how \\(S\\) uses the concept, her grasp of\nit, and how it should be used if she were to use it in keeping with\nits content. To illustrate the distinction, it is common to appeal to\nTyler Burge\u2019s discussion of how social factors, under certain\nconditions, serve to determine content (Burge 1979; Peacocke 1992: 29;\nMillar 2004: 181\u2013188). Burge gives an account of concept\nattribution that goes via word meaning. To be attributed the concept\narcane, on this view, it suffices that \\(S\\) uses the\nexpression \u201carcane\u201d by and large correctly, \u201cin\nkeeping with its content\u201d\u2014if she is committed to her\ncommunity practice of using the corresponding expression\n\u201carcane\u201d. What determines her concept, thus, is not merely\nfacts about her use and dispositions to stand corrected, but facts\nabout the use of the term in the wider practice. It follows that\nspeakers typically have an incomplete grasp of the concepts they think\nwith and, as a result, tend to misuse these concepts.\n\nLeaving aside the controversial question of whether we can separate\npossession conditions of concepts from attribution conditions, it\nmight be asked whether Burge\u2019s social externalism can be\nemployed to support CE normativity. Burge\u2019s argument depends on\nthe (empirical) assumption that the individual is committed to the\ncommunity practice (Burge 1979: 94\u201395, 101\u2013102; Millar\n2004: 182). But if the normativity in question is made conditional on\nthe individual\u2019s commitment to the community, it does not follow\nthat content is essentially normative. After all, an individual who is\nnot thus committed would still have concepts. (Equally, in the case of\nthe experts, the suggested normative dimension would seem to drop\nout.) What would be required, rather, is an argument to the effect\nthat the concept expressed is necessarily determined by the community\npractice, independently of \\(S\\)\u2018s commitments.\n\nArguments from concept grasp, again, typically appeal to the idea that\nthere are rationality constraints on concept attributions. As noted in\nthe discussion of ME normativity, the question has been raised whether\nthe idea that there are such constraints coheres with normativism. It\nhas been suggested that this question is particularly pressing in the\ncase of content. When it comes to meaning, there is the option of\nattributing meaning errors and explaining the error by appealing to\nthe subject\u2019s mistaken conception of the meaning of an\nexpression, thereby rationalizing her reasoning and actions. In the\ncase of concepts, this option is not available, since the error is\nsaid to occur at the level of content. It would either have to be\nargued that the error can be rationalized some other way, or the claim\nthat there are rationality constraints on content attributions would\nhave to be rejected (see Brown 2004, Wikforss 2015 and 2017).\n3.2 Content Determining Normativity\n\nLike MD normativism, CD normativism is a foundational claim:\nIntentional content is (at least partially) metaphysically determined\nby rules or norms, content facts are, if you will, (at least\npartially) \u201cgrounded\u201d by normative facts. Since the\nrelevant norms or rules govern intentional mental states, the CD\nnormativist typically tries to find a particular kind of state\nplausibly subject to rules or norms that by the same token (at least\npartially) determine contents for states of this kind. As truth and\ninference are intimately connected with both content and belief, the\ndebate focuses on norms for belief.\n\nBesides truth norms like\n (\\(\\NB_1)\\)\n and \\((\\NB_2)\\) above, two further kinds of candidate norms of belief\nhave been discussed: knowledge norms, and norms of\nrationality, justification, or\n inference.[54]\n CD normativism then is the claim that beliefs cannot have content\nunless rules or norms of at least one of these kinds are in force for\nthem. Strong versions of CD normativism hold that CD norms also\ndetermine which contents beliefs have. And again, being in force can\nroughly be interpreted in three ways: As requiring the subject to\nfollow the relevant rule or norm \\(R\\), to accept\n\\(R\\) in a sense not requiring (general) following, or as\nindependent of the subject\u2019s attitudes and intentional states\ntowards \\(R\\) (see above,\n section 2.2.1).\n\nAs in the case of meaning, CD normativism most often is a form of\nguidance normativism construing belief formation as an\nessentially rule-guided activity. Those inspired by pragmatism and/or\nWittgensteinian anti-platonism might also think of the relevant rules\nas \u201cof our own making\u201d (Baker & Hacker 1985; Brandom\n1994). A fairly common idea is that believers follow basic, objective\nnorms such as truth or knowledge norms by means of being\nguided by subjective ones such as the rules of rationality (Boghossian\n2003), but others take subjective rules as\n basic,[55]\n or argue that the nature of belief is given by subjective and\nobjective norms in combination (Wedgwood 2007: 162).\n\nUnsurprisingly, norms or rules for (rational) reasoning\nreceive a lot of attention. Prime examples are inference rules such as\nmodus ponens or the law of non-contradiction. Purely formal\nrules would arguably be too weak for the purposes of strong CD\nnormativism; normative inferentialists such as Brandom (1994; 2000) or\nPeregrin (2008) therefore include norms governing material implication\namong the content determining rules. In general, principles governing\nepistemic rationality (as, for instance, formalized in Bayesian\nepistemology) are further examples, and for those who hold that there\ncan be good practical reasons for belief, principles of practical\nreasoning are also\n relevant.[56]\n\nAs we have already seen in\n section 2.2\n above, regress worries arise if CD normativism takes the form of\nguidance normativism. Here, a pragmatic conception of rule guidance\nsuch as Brandom\u2019s normative version of inferentialism (Brandom\n1994) might help. To avoid regresses, Brandom takes norms implicitly\n\u201cinstituted\u201d by our practices to be basic and proposes a\npragmatic phenomenalism about such norms. Objective\n\u201cdeontic statuses\u201d are to be explained in terms of our\nnormative attitudes. Something\u2019s being correct, that\nis, is to be explained in terms of the attitude of taking it to be\ncorrect, making the norms in question \u201cin some sense\ncreatures of ours\u201d (1994: 626); yet, the goal is to secure and\nexplain the \u201cobjectivity of concepts\u201d (1994:\n xvii).[57]\n As attitudes of taking something to be correct can themselves be\ncorrect or incorrect, being correct ultimately has to be\nexplained in terms of being correctly taken to be correct. In\nthis sense, the normativity is irreducible\u2014it is \u201cnorms\nall the way down\u201d (1994: 44; 625).\n\nQuestions that have been raised for pragmatic phenomenalism include\nwhether it in fact can account for contents the truth of which is\nindependent of our attitudes. Because it explains normative statuses\nby means of further normative statuses, pragmatic phenomenalism might\nnot be able to tell us anything informative about how we make or\n\u201cinstitute\u201d the basic norms implicit in our practices (cf.\nRosen 2001, Hattiangadi 2003) or to account for the difference between\ninstituting and merely being in accordance with a norm. Yet another\nregress worry has also been raised: if for any normative status to be\ninstituted by an implicit norm a further normative status already\nneeds to be so instituted, an infinite regress of (implicit) norms\nmight ensue despite the pragmatist nature of the proposal (cf.\nHattiangadi 2007: 197; Gl\u00fcer & Wikforss 2009: 60ff). This\nregress might not be vicious if the project is interpreted as an\nexpressivist one, however.\n\nEven if guidance normativism would inescapably lead to some form of\nregress, one might still hold on to the claim that there are\ncontentful intentional states only if for instance the rules of\nrationality are in force for them. As we noted already in the previous\nversion of this entry, such force might require acceptance, but not\n(general) guidance, or it might be completely independent of the\nattitudes of thinkers. Highlighting both these options, it has\nrecently been argued that guidance normativism is unnecessarily\ndemanding.\n\nFor one thing, even if the relevant rules require some sort of\nacceptance to be in force, not every performance governed by them\nneeds to actually be guided by them (cf. Hlobil 2015; Tracy 2020).\nPlausible as this might initially seem, especially when thinking along\nthe lines of the game analogy, a general observation of this kind does\nnot yet substantiate the claim that an account of constitutive\nrules\u2019 being in force that implements this possibility would be\napplicable to CD rules or\n norms.[58]\n Moreover, it should be noted that for CD rules or norms, making this\nmove might not just amount to acknowledging that not every instance of\nbelief formation has to be rule-guided. If the move is to stop an\nintentional condition on rule-following from giving rise to a regress,\nwe might end up having to say that every instance of rule-guided\nbelief formation requires the unguided formation of at least\none other belief or intentional state. For every rule that is followed\n(on a particular occasion), that is, there is another that governs,\nbut cannot guide, the formation of a further intentional\nstate of the rule-follower (on that\n occasion).[59]\n This is at least a surprising situation to end up in for a defender\nof the view that belief is essentially governed by rules that can\nguide belief\n formation.[60]\n CD normativism might thus prove viable only if the force of the\nrelevant rules or norms can plausibly be construed in complete\nindependence of the attitudes of the thinkers.\n4. Concluding Remarks: Normativism and Naturalism\n\nThe idea that the normative in some sense is not part of nature goes\nback at least to Kant (see, for instance, Critique of Pure\nReason [1781 [A 547]]). Already Hume (in the Treatise\n[1739\u20131740]) argued against the metaethical naturalist that\nought cannot be derived from is\u2014to try to do\nso would be to commit a so-called \u201cnaturalistic fallacy\u201d.\nWith the \u201copen question argument\u201d, Moore (in Principia\nEthica [1903]) added a weapon to the anti-naturalist\u2019s\narsenal also against giving naturalistic accounts of moral\nevaluations: According to the open question argument, there is no\nnaturalistic (set of) concept(s) analytically equivalent to the moral\nconcept of goodness, since no matter what naturalistic definition is\ngiven, the question whether all and only things satisfying it are good\nstill makes sense. Much of recent normativism about meaning/content\ncontinues in this anti-naturalist tradition; many normativists about\nmeaning/content hold that the essential normativity of meaning/content\nmakes at least (fully) reductive naturalism untenable.\n\nMany have construed Kripke\u2019s Wittgenstein as saying exactly\nthat: it is part of his skeptical campaign against semantic facts in\ngeneral that such facts cannot be reduced to whatever precisely is\nallowed in a naturalistic supervenience base for meaning/content. An\nargument for this could take a weaker, intensionalist, and a stronger,\nextensionalist, form (cf. Boghossian 1989a: 532ff). The stronger\nargument concludes that no reductive naturalist account of\nmeaning/content will be extensionally correct: For any\nmeaning/concept, such an account will either include objects in its\nextension that, intuitively, do not belong there, or exclude objects\nfrom its extension that, intuitively, do belong there, or both. As we\nsaw above\n (section 2.2.1),\n this \u201cproblem of error\u201d is a problem for many\nnaturalistic accounts of meaning/content, but as such it does not yet\nhave anything to do with normativity. To that, the normativist could\nrespond that it is precisely because of their essential normativity\nthat no naturalistic account of meaning/content can be extensionally\ncorrect. The weaker argument grants extensional correctness, but\nargues that no naturalistic reduction will get the intension of the\nnotion of meaning/content right; it will inevitably miss the normative\ncharacter of what is semantically correct, its deontic or axiologic\ncharacteristics.\n\nDespite the normativists\u2019 argument, it seems fair to say that at\nthis point in time, the case from normativism against reductive\nnaturalism about meaning/content has not yet been fully made. To make\ntheir case, the semantic normativist could resort to adopting a\nmetaethical approach: arguments in the tradition of Hume and Moore\nmight well be adaptable to their case (cf. Miller 1998, 188ff;\nHattiangadi 2007, 38ff; Gibbard 2012; Zalabardo 2012). As Hattiangadi\nargues, though, the semantic normativist\u2019s case ends up being\nhostage to whatever controversial assumptions these arguments rely on\n(motivational internalism, for instance, might be such an issue), thus\nremoving normativism further from being the pre-theoretical constraint\non acceptable accounts of meaning/content that Kripke\u2019s skeptic\nmeant it to be. What\u2019s more, one might worry that the topic of\n\u201creduction\u201d is itself more nuanced than the normativist\nmakes it to be. As we have seen in\n section 2.2,\n it is still possible to argue that some (set of) dispositions might\nplay a role in meaning-determination. Alternatively, it is possible to\nendorse partially reductive accounts construing meaning/content as\ndetermined by a dispositional and a non-semantic, but normative,\ncomponent.\n\nFurthermore, even if normativism about meaning/content might exclude\n(fully) reductive naturalism about meaning/content, it should be noted\nthat adopting normativism would not seem to be the only option for the\nanti-reductivist (cf. Mulligan 1999: 136f; Gl\u00fcer & Wikforss\n2009: 63ff). What the normativist construes as norms or rules of\nmeaning/content, principles such as\n (CM)\n or inferential rules such as modus ponens, might also be construed in\na very different way: As, or in analogy with what Frege called\n\u201claws of truth\u201d (Frege 1918 [1986: 30]). In the same vein,\nHusserl called the \u201claws of logic\u201d \u201cideal\u201d\n(Husserl 1913: 56)). These \u201claws\u201d are neither\nprescriptions for thinking, nor nomological generalities of our\npsychology. Their \u201cvalidity\u201d or necessity is sui\ngeneris; if anything, it is what we might today call\n metaphysical.[61]",
