    "main_text": "Early Responses || Pauli\n4.2 Pauli\n\nIn his lecture accepting the Nobel Prize (which was awarded in 1945\nfor his discovery of the exclusion principle) Wolfgang Pauli describes\nthe fundamental methodological differences between Bohr and\nSommerfeld:\n\nAt that time there were two approaches to the difficult problems\nconnected with the quantum of action. One was an effort to bring\nabstract order to the new ideas by looking for a key to translate\nclassical mechanics and electrodynamics into quantum language which\nwould form a logical generalization of these. This was the direction\nwhich was taken by Bohr\u2019s \u201ccorrespondence\nprinciple.\u201d Sommerfeld, however, preferred, in view of the\ndifficulties which blocked the use of the concepts of kinematical\nmodels, a direct interpretation, as independent of models as possible,\nof the laws of spectra in terms of integral numbers\u2026 (Pauli\n1946, p. 27)\n\n\nAlthough in hindsight, Pauli claims that both methodologies influenced\nhim, in his correspondence dating from 1924 and 1925, one finds Pauli\nalmost exclusively defending a Sommerfeldian approach, dismissing both\nthe correspondence principle and model-based reasoning more generally.\nPauli\u2019s critical remarks about Bohr\u2019s correspondence\nprinciple center on two issues. First, Pauli objected to the use of\neven a \u201cformal\u201d notion of an electron orbit, which is\ncentral to the application of the correspondence principle (e.g.,\nPauli to Bohr, February 21st 1924). Second, Pauli doubted that the\ncorrespondence principle would be able to explain the closing of the\nelectron shells as Bohr had hoped. In 1924 Pauli wrote to Bohr:\n\nI have already often said to you that I am of the opinion that the\nCorrespondence Principle has in reality nothing to do with the problem\nof the closing of the groups in the atom\u2026 The exclusion of\ncertain stationary states (not transitions), which is what is\nin question here, has more similarity in principle with the exclusion\nof the state \\(m = 0\\) or \\(k = 0\\) in the H-atom than, for\nexample, with the selection rule \\(\\Delta k = \\pm 1\\). Do you\nstill cling to your \u2026 application of the Correspondence\nPrinciple in this case? \u2026 There is moreover no need whatever to\ntalk of harmonic interplay. (Pauli to Bohr, December 12th, 1924;\nquoted in Serwer 1977, p. 235)\n\n\nReading between the lines, Pauli seems to understand Bohr\u2019s\ncorrespondence principle as a selection rule about transitions between\nstationary states that are connected with harmonics in the classical\nmotion. His objection is not to this correspondence principle, but\nrather with attempts at extending this principle to explain the\nclosing of electron groups in the atom\u2014the sort of extension of\nthe correspondence principle that Pauli elsewhere referred to as\n\u201ccorrespondence principle imperialism\u201d (Imperialismus\ndes Korrespondenzprinzips) (Pauli to Heisenberg, February 28th,\n1925; quoted in Serwer 1977, p.233). The closing of electron shells\nwould ultimately be explained by Pauli\u2019s exclusion principle,\nthough initially Pauli was dissatisfied with such an explanation\ninsofar as his exclusion rule could not be given a more general\ngrounding and justification. When Bohr suggested that the\ncorrespondence principle might provide such a grounding for the\nexclusion principle, Pauli replied,\n\nI personally do not believe, however, that the correspondence\nprinciple will lead to a foundation of the rule\u2026 For weak men,\nwho need the crutch of the idea of unambiguously defined electron\norbits and mechanical models, the rule can be grounded as follows:\n\u2018If more than one electron have the same quantum numbers in\nstrong fields, they would have the same orbits and would therefore\ncollide\u2026 The justification of the exclusion of the\nabove-mentioned cases in the H-atom by pointing to the collision with\nthe nucleus has never pleased me much. It would be much more\nsatisfying if we could understand directly on the grounds of\na more general quantum mechanics (one that deviates from classical\nmechanics). (Pauli to Bohr December 31st, 1924; quoted in Heilbron\n1983, p. 306 and Serwer 1977, p. 236)\n\n\nIn the above quotation we see Pauli siding with Sommerfeld, in his\ndistrust of the correspondence principle and model-based reasoning in\ngeneral, and in his preference for a \u201cdirect\u201d\ninterpretation in terms of a new quantum mechanics.\n",
