    "main_text": "Epistemology: The Cognitive Functions of Models || Understanding with models\n3.4 Understanding with models\n\nMany authors have pointed out that understanding is one of the central\ngoals of science (see, for instance, de Regt 2017; Elgin 2017; Khalifa\n2017; Potochnik 2017). In some cases, we want to understand a certain\nphenomenon (e.g., why the sky is blue); in other cases, we want to\nunderstand a specific scientific theory (e.g., quantum mechanics) that\naccounts for a phenomenon in question. Sometimes we gain understanding\nof a phenomenon by understanding the corresponding theory or model.\nFor instance, Maxwell\u2019s theory of electromagnetism helps us\nunderstand why the sky is blue. It is, however, controversial whether\nunderstanding a phenomenon always presupposes an\nunderstanding of the corresponding theory (de Regt 2009: 26). \n\nAlthough there are many different ways of gaining understanding,\nmodels and the activity of scientific modeling are of particular\nimportance here (de Regt et al. 2009; Morrison 2009; Potochnik 2017;\nRice 2016). This insight\ncan be traced back at least to Lord Kelvin who, in his famous 1884\nBaltimore Lectures on Molecular Dynamics and the Wave Theory of\nLight, maintained that \u201cthe test of \u2018Do we or do we\nnot understand a particular subject in physics?\u2019 is \u2018Can\nwe make a mechanical model of it?\u2019\u201d (Kelvin 1884 [1987: 111]; see also Bailer-Jones 2009: Ch.\u00a02; and de Regt 2017: Ch.\u00a06). \n\nBut why do models play such a crucial role in the understanding of a\nsubject matter? Elgin (2017) argues that this is not despite, but\nbecause, of models being literally false. She views false models as\n\u201cfelicitous falsehoods\u201d that occupy center stage in the\nepistemology of science, and mentions the ideal-gas model in\nstatistical mechanics and the Hardy\u2013Weinberg model in genetics as\nexamples for literally false models that are central to their\nrespective disciplines. Understanding is holistic and it concerns a\ntopic, a discipline, or a subject matter, rather than isolated claims\nor facts. Gaining understanding of a context means to have \n\n\nan epistemic commitment to a comprehensive, systematically linked body\nof information that is grounded in fact, is duly responsive to reasons\nor evidence, and enables nontrivial inference, argument, and perhaps\naction regarding the topic the information pertains to (Elgin 2017:\n44) \n\n\nand models can play a crucial role in the pursuit of these epistemic\ncommitments. For a discussion of Elgin\u2019s account of models and\nunderstanding, see Baumberger and Brun (2017) and Frigg and Nguyen\n(forthcoming).\n\nElgin (2017), Lipton (2009), and Rice (2016) all argue that models can be used to understand\nindependently of their ability to provide an explanation. Other\nauthors, among them Strevens (2008, 2013), argue that understanding\npresupposes a scientific explanation and that\n\n\nan individual has scientific understanding of a phenomenon just in\ncase they grasp a correct scientific explanation of that phenomenon.\n(Strevens 2013: 510; see,\nhowever, Sullivan and Khalifa 2019) \n\n\nOn this account, understanding consists in a particular form of\nepistemic access an individual scientist has to an explanation. For\nStrevens this aspect is \u201cgrasping\u201d, while for de Regt\n(2017) it is \u201cintelligibility\u201d. It is important to note\nthat both Strevens and de Regt hold that such \u201csubjective\u201d\naspects are a worthy topic for investigations in the philosophy of\nscience. This contrasts with the traditional view (see, e.g., Hempel\n1965) that delegates them to the realm of psychology. See Friedman\n(1974), Trout (2002), and\nReutlinger et al. (2018) for further discussions of understanding.\n",
