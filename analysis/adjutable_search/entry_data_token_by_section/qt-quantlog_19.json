Classical Representations\n\nThe perennial question in the interpretation of quantum mechanics is\nthat of whether or not essentially classical explanations are\navailable, even in principle, for quantum-mechanical phenomena.\nQuantum logic has played a large role in shaping (and clarifying) this\ndiscussion, in particular by allowing us to be quite precise about\nwhat we mean by a classical explanation. \n",
