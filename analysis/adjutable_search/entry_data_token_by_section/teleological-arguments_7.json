    "main_text": "Alternative Explanation || Indirect Causation, Design and Evidences\n3.2 Indirect Causation, Design and Evidences\n\nHistorically, design cases were in fact widely understood to allow for\nindirect intelligent agent design and causation, the very\ncausal structures producing the relevant phenomena being themselves\ndeliberately designed for the purpose of producing those\n phenomena.[9]\n For instance, it was typically believed that God could have initiated\nspecial conditions and processes at the instant of creation which\noperating entirely on their own could produce organisms and other\nintended (and designed) results with no subsequent agent intervention\nrequired. Paley himself, the authors of the Bridgewater\nTreatises and others were explicitly clear that whether or not\nsomething was designed was an issue largely separable from the means\nof production in question. Historically it was insisted that design in\nnature did track back eventually to intelligent agency\nsomewhere and that any design we find in nature would\nnot\u2014and could not\u2014have been there had there ultimately\nbeen no mind involved. But commentators (including many scientists) at\nleast from the early 17th century on (e.g., Francis Bacon and Robert\nBoyle) very clearly distinguished the creative initiating of nature\nitself from interventions within the path of nature once initiated.\nFor instance, over two centuries before Darwin, Bacon wrote:\n\nGod \u2026 doth accomplish and fulfill his divine will [by ways] not\nimmediate and direct, but by compass; not violating Nature, which is\nhis own law upon the creation. (Quoted in Whewell 1834, 358)\n\n\nIndeed, if the Rs in question did directly indicate the\ninfluence of a mind, then means of production\u2014whether unbroken\ncausation or gappy\u2014would be of minimal evidential importance.\nThus, the frequent contemporary claim that design arguments all\ninvolve appeal to special divine intervention during the course of\nnature\u2019s history\u2014that in short design arguments are\n\u201cGod-of-the-gaps\u201d arguments\u2014represents serious\nhistorical (and present) inaccuracy.\n\nHowever, if Rs result from gapless chains of natural causal\nprocesses, the evidential impact of those Rs again threatens\nto become problematic and ambiguous, since there will a\nfortiori be at the immediate level a full natural causal account\nfor\n them.[10]\n Design will, in such cases, play no immediate mechanistic explanatory\nrole, suggesting its superfluousness. But even if such conceptions\nwere explanatorily and scientifically superfluous at that level, that\ndoes not entail that they are conceptually, alethically, inferential,\nor otherwise superfluous in general. The role of mind might be\nindirect, deeply buried, or at several levels of remove from the\nimmediate production mechanism but would still have to be present at\nsome level. In short, on the above picture Darwinian evolution will\nnot meet condition (e) for explaining away design, which is not itself\na shortcoming of Darwinian evolution.\n\nBut any gap-free argument will depend crucially upon the Rs\nin question being ultimately dependent for their eventual\noccurrence upon agent activity. That issue could be integrated back\ninto an altered Schema 2 by replacing (6) with:\n\n(6a) Design-like properties (R) are (most probably) not\nproducible by means ultimately devoid of\nmind/intention\u2014i.e., any phenomena exhibiting such Rs\nmust be a product (at least indirectly) of intentional design.\n\n\nThe focus must now become whether or not the laws and conditions\nrequired for the indirect production of life, intelligent life, etc.,\ncould themselves be independent of intention, design, and mind at some\ndeep (perhaps primordial, pre-cosmic) point. In recent decades,\nexactly that question has arisen increasingly insistently from within\nthe scientific community.\n",
