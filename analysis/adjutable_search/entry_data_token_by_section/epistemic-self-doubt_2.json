    "main_text": "Conditional Principles || What Would the Maximally Rational Subject Do?\n2.2 What Would the Maximally Rational Subject Do?\n\nAnother way of representing self-doubt using conditional probability\nfollows the intuitive thought that I should tailor my first-order\ndegree of belief to the confidence I think the maximally rational\nsubject would have if she were in my situation (Christensen 2010b:\n121). This would be a sensible explanation of the authority of higher\norder beliefs, of why taking them into account would be justified. It\ngives half of an answer to the question when the first-order should\nand shouldn\u2019t defer to the second order by identifying a class\nof second-order statements to which the first order must always defer.\nHowever it pushes back the question of which individual statements\nthose are to the question of which probability function is the\nmaximally rational.\n\nA conditional principle that would capture the idea of deferring to\nthe view of an ideal agent who was in one\u2019s shoes is:\n\n\\[\nCr(q\\mid P_{M}(q) = x) = x\n\\]\n\n\n(Christensen 2010b) which says that one\u2019s credence in q\ngiven that the maximally rational subject in one\u2019s situation has\ncredence x in q, should be x. The maximally\nrational subject obeys the probability axioms and possibly has further\nrationality properties that one might not possess oneself, though she\nis assumed to be in your situation, having no more evidence than you\ndo. If one obeys the probability axioms oneself, then this principle\nbecomes:\n\n\nRatRef\n\n\\(P(q\\mid P_{M}(q) = x) = x \\) \n\n\nThis says that your credence in q should be whatever you take\nthe maximally rational credence to be for your situation, an idea that\nseems hard to argue with. It is a variant of a principle used by Haim\nGaifman (1988) to construct a theory of higher-order probability.\nThere the role of \\(P_{M}\\) was given to what has become known as an\nexpert function corresponding, in his use, to the\nprobabilities of a subject who has maximal knowledge.\n\nRatRef gives a sensible account of cases like the underslept doctor.\nIt would say the reason that the realization she is sleep-deprived\nshould make her less confident of her diagnosis is that a maximally\nrational person in her situation would have a lower confidence.\nMoreover this provides us with a way of representing the state of\nself-doubt coherently, even with perfect knowledge of what one\u2019s\nbelief states are. One can have degree of belief y in q,\nand one can even believe that one has degree of belief y, that\nis, believe that \\(P(q) = y\\), consistently with believing that the\nmaximally rational agent has degree of belief x, i.e.,\n\\(P_{M}(q) =x\\), because these are two different probability\nfunctions.\n\nBecause self-doubt is not defined as a violation of the conditional\nprobability RatRef, as it was with SR, we can also see a revision that\ntakes you from self-doubt to having your confidence match that of the\nmaximally rational subject as rational according to\nconditionalization. You may have degree of belief y in\nq, discover that the maximally rational subject has degree of\nbelief x, and because you have the conditional probability\nRatRef put yourself in line with that ideal subject. Note that it is\nnot necessary to have an explicit belief about what your own degree of\nbelief in q is for this revision to occur or to be\nrational.\n\nRatRef has problems that are easiest to see by considering a\ngeneralization of it:\n\n\nRational Reflection (RR)\n\n\\(P(q\\mid P' \\textrm{ is ideal}) = P'(q) \\) \n\n\nRational Reflection (Elga 2013) maintains the idea that my degree of\nbelief in q should be in line with that I think the maximally\nrational subject would have in my situation, but also highlights the\nfact that my determining what this value is depends on my identifying\nwhich probability function is the maximally rational one to have. I\ncan be coherent while being uncertain about that, and there are cases\nwhere that seems like the most rational option. This by itself is not\na problem because RR is consistent with using an expected value for\nthe ideal subject, a weighted average of the values for q of\nthe subjects I think might be the maximally rational subject. But it\nis not only I who may be uncertain about who the maximally rational\nsubject is. Arguably the maximally rational subject herself may be\nuncertain that she is\u2014after all, this is a contingent fact, and\none might think that anyone\u2019s confidence in it should depend on\nempirical evidence (Elga 2013).\n\nThe possibility of this combination of things leads to a problem for\nRR, for if the subject who is actually the maximally rational one is\nunsure that she is, then if she follows RR she won\u2019t fully trust\nher own first-order verdict on q but will as I do correct it to\na weighted average of the verdicts of those subjects she thinks might\nbe the maximally rational one. In this case my degree of belief in\nq given that she is the maximally rational subject\nshould not be her degree of belief in q. It should be the one\nshe would have in case she were certain that she were the maximally\nrational subject:\n\n\nNew Rational Reflection (NRR)\n\n\\(P(q\\mid P' \\textrm{ is ideal}) = P'(q\\mid P' \\textrm{ is ideal}) \\)\n\n\n\nThis principle (Elga 2013) also faces problems, which are developed\nbelow through the approach to self-doubt via higher-order\nevidence.\n\nThe approach asking what the maximally rational subject would do gives\na motivation for the idea that second-order evidence has authority\nwith respect to first-order beliefs, and like the SR approach puts the\nsecond order in the driver\u2019s seat by having a statement of\nprobability in the condition of the conditional probability. This may\nappear to give unconditional authority to second-order evidence, but\nsecond-order evidence won\u2019t change the subject\u2019s\nfirst-order verdict if she believes the latter is already what the\nmaximally rational subject would think. The approach represents\nself-doubt as a coherent state that one can also coherently revise via\nconditionalization. It identifies a state of matching between the\norders\u2014matching one\u2019s confidence to one\u2019s best guess\nof the maximally rational subject\u2019s confidence. This gives a\ngeneral rule, and demands that same matching for all cases, though\ngives no explicit guidance about how to determine which is the\nmaximally rational subject or degree of belief.\n",
