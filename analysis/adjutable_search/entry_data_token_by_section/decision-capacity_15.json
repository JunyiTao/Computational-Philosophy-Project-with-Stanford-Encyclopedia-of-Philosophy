    "main_text": "Five Widely Accepted Assumptions (And a Sixth, More Controversial One) || Risk and Symmetry\n5.6 Risk and Symmetry\n\nPart of what is involved in reasoning about a particular course of\naction and reaching a decision is weighing the risks and benefits\nassociated with the likely consequences of proposed options. In health\ncare contexts where consent is at issue, this normally amounts to a\ndecisional problem that is framed in symmetrical terms: either one\nconsents to a given treatment option, or one refuses that same option.\nThis way of framing things seems to assume that both poles of the\ndecision are symmetrical and that mental capacity necessarily remains\nfixed as one evaluates the two options. Yet this is an assumption that\ncan be philosophically challenged.\n\nIt is sometimes argued that consent and refusal to the same proposed\nintervention should not always be treated symmetrically, by which it\nis meant that an individual could sometimes be competent to consent to\na treatment that she is not competent to refuse. The reasoning is that\nthe risks respectively associated with consenting to or refusing\ntreatment are not always the same. From this it is inferred that the\ndecisions are not the same and that therefore, decisions to consent or\nrefuse the very same treatment should not automatically be\ntreated symmetrically.\n\nTo see what is at stake consider a case where a patient is refusing a\nlow risk treatment that is highly beneficial for those with her\ncondition. And suppose as well that the patient will die without it.\nOf course, it is always true of any patient in any situation that she\nmight make a mistake, i.e., a judgment that does not really serve her\ninterests even as she understands them. But in this case if refusal is\na mistake it is a mistake with much worse consequences for the\npatient. Since in this case the harms associated with mistaken refusal\nare much greater than the harms associated with mistaken consent, the\nlevel of competence required to refuse can legitimately be set higher.\n\n\nThere have been substantial debates over the symmetricality question\n(Brock 1991; Buller 2001; Cale 1999; Checkland 2001; Skene 1991;\nWicclair 1991, 1999; Wilks 1997, 1999). A key feature of the debate is\nwhether or not mental capacity should be considered a fixed mental\ncommodity (Buchanan & Brock 1989: 60). In other words, relative to\na particular yes-or-no decision such as the one described above,\nshould we articulate a single threshold (a certain level or degree of\nunderstanding, appreciation, etc. that the patient must have) such\nthat any patient above the threshold should be free to either consent\nor refuse? Or is it better to view such a choice as two different\ndecisions and so articulate two different thresholds, one for\nacceptance and one for refusal, setting the threshold higher for those\npatients inclined to refuse?\n\nThose who are skeptical of this approach point out that it is highly\ncounterintuitive to say that mental capacity can vary\naccording to external circumstances. Moreover, as some critics claim,\n\n\n\nOne point of determining whether a person is competent to make a\ndecision about medical treatment is to allow a competent patient to\nmake any decisions he wants regarding that kind of treatment. (Culver\n& Gert 1990: 620; Culver & Gert 2004) \n\n\nIn a way, it is true that abilities don\u2019t change simply because\nthe risks of exercising them do. To illustrate with a simple,\nnon-medical analogy, consider a cooking student who has learned to\nmake a perfect omelet and now succeeds in making one nine out of ten\nattempts. This is her current ability level and it does not change\neven if the consequences of failure change. In one case, perhaps,\nfailure simply means she has no omelet, but only scrambled eggs, for\nbreakfast, whereas in another case failure to make the omelet properly\nmight cost her admission to chef school. But the odds of failure are\nthe same in each case: 1 in 10. In effect those who favor an\nasymmetrical requirement think that it is fair to require a higher\nlevel of ability (and so a lower chance of failure) when the negative\nconsequences of failure are higher. And this does seem to be about\nprotection rather than ability per se.\n\nHowever, the moral rationale for the approach appeals to a more\ngeneral, overarching rationale for assessing capacity in the first\nplace (Buchanan & Brock 1989: 51). The claim is that we assess\ncapacity because we recognize the need to strike a balance between two\ndistinct and potentially conflicting values. On the one hand, as a\nsociety we place a very high value on personal autonomy and free\nchoice. But if that was our only societal value we would not bother to\nassess capacity but would simply honor any choice that a patient made\n(as long as she could express it). That we don\u2019t do this\ndemonstrates that we also clearly value patient welfare and recognize\nthat as mental capacities become more and more compromised the risk to\nwelfare posed by free choice increases. From the start then, setting\nthresholds for decision-making capacity is an exercise in trying to\nstrike the right balance between giving people as much freedom as\npossible while protecting the most vulnerable among us.\n\nThe asymmetrical approach to decisions simply extends this basic\nidea\u2014this desire to balance concern for autonomy and protection\nof welfare\u2014further. Once we recognize that choosing one way can\nplace welfare at much greater risk than choosing the other way, it\nmakes sense to strike the autonomy-welfare balance differently for\neach prong of the choice. Since welfare is more at risk in one case\nthan the other, we set the threshold for selecting that option higher\n(thereby slightly reducing the chance that the subject will be free to\nmake it). But since welfare is not at risk in the other case, the\nthreshold remains low, to maximize the chance that the patient will be\nfree to make that choice if she is inclined to.\n",
