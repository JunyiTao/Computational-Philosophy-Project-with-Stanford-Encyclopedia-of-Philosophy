    "main_text": "Contrastive Underdetermination, Empirical Equivalents, and Unconceived Alternatives || Empirically Equivalent Theories\n3.3 Unconceived Alternatives and A New Induction\n\nStanford (2001, 2006) concludes that no convincing general case has\nbeen made for the presumption that there are empirically equivalent\nrivals to all or most scientific theories, or to any theories besides\nthose for which such equivalents can actually be constructed. But he\ngoes on to insist that empirical equivalents are no essential part of\nthe case for a significant problem of contrastive underdetermination.\nOur efforts to confirm scientific theories, he suggests, are no less\nthreatened by what Larry Sklar (1975, 1981) has called\n\u201ctransient\u201d underdetermination, that is, theories which\nare not empirically equivalent but are equally (or at least\nreasonably) well confirmed by all the evidence we happen to have in\nhand at the moment, so long as this transient predicament is also\n\u201crecurrent\u201d, that is, so long as we think that there is\n(probably) at least one such (fundamentally distinct) alternative\navailable\u2014and thus the transient predicament\nre-arises\u2014whenever we are faced with a decision about whether to\nbelieve a given theory at a given time. Stanford argues that a\nconvincing case for contrastive underdetermination of this recurrent,\ntransient variety can indeed be made, and that the evidence for it is\navailable in the historical record of scientific inquiry itself.\n\nStanford concedes that present theories are not transiently\nunderdetermined by the theoretical alternatives we have actually\ndeveloped and considered to date: we think that our own scientific\ntheories are considerably better confirmed by the evidence than any\nrivals we have actually produced. The central question, he argues, is\nwhether we should believe that there are well confirmed alternatives\nto our best scientific theories that are presently\nunconceived by us. And the primary reason we should believe that\nthere are, he claims, is the long history of repeated transient\nunderdetermination by previously unconceived alternatives\nacross the course of scientific inquiry. In the progression from\nAristotelian to Cartesian to Newtonian to contemporary mechanical\ntheories, for instance, the evidence available at the time each\nearlier theory dominated the practice of its day also offered\ncompelling support for each of the later alternatives (unconceived at\nthe time) that would ultimately come to displace it. Stanford\u2019s\n\u201cNew Induction\u201d over the history of science claims that\nthis situation is typical; that is, that \u201cwe have, throughout\nthe history of scientific inquiry and in virtually every scientific\nfield, repeatedly occupied an epistemic position in which we could\nconceive of only one or a few theories that were well confirmed by the\navailable evidence, while subsequent inquiry would routinely (if not\ninvariably) reveal further, radically distinct alternatives as well\nconfirmed by the previously available evidence as those we were\ninclined to accept on the strength of that evidence\u201d (2006, 19).\nIn other words, Stanford claims that in the past we have repeatedly\nfailed to exhaust the space of fundamentally distinct theoretical\npossibilities that were well confirmed by the existing evidence, and\nthat we have every reason to believe that we are probably also failing\nto exhaust the space of such alternatives that are well confirmed by\nthe evidence we have at present. Much of the rest of his case is taken\nup with discussing historical examples illustrating that earlier\nscientists did not simply ignore or dismiss, but instead genuinely\nfailed to conceive of the serious, fundamentally distinct\ntheoretical possibilities that would ultimately come to displace the\ntheories they defended, only to be displaced in turn by others that\nwere similarly unconceived at the time. He concludes that \u201cthe\nhistory of scientific inquiry itself offers a straightforward\nrationale for thinking that there typically are alternatives to our\nbest theories equally well confirmed by the evidence, even when we are\nunable to conceive of them at the time\u201d (2006, 20; for\nreservations and criticisms concerning this line of argument, see\nMagnus 2006, 2010; Godfrey-Smith 2008; Chakravartty 2008; Devitt 2011;\nRuhmkorff 2011; Lyons 2013). Stanford concedes, however, that the\nhistorical record can offer only fallible evidence of a distinctive,\ngeneral problem of contrastive scientific underdetermination, rather\nthan the kind of deductive proof that champions of the case from\nempirical equivalents have typically sought. Thus, claims and\narguments about the various forms that underdetermination may take,\ntheir causes and consequences, and the further significance they hold\nfor the scientific enterprise as a whole continue to evolve in the\nlight of ongoing controversy, and the underdetermination of scientific\ntheory by evidence remains very much a live and unresolved issue in\nthe philosophy of science.\n",
