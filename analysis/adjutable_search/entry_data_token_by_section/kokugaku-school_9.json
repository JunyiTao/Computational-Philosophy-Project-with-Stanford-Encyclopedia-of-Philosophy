One such\nindividual was Yano Harumichi or Gend\u014d (1823\u20131887) who\nworked with like-minded Kokugaku scholars, Shinto priests, and\neducators in reviving ancient institutions and rites as an essential part of modern society. Harumichi was a retainer of \u014czu\ndomain. After moving to Edo, he studied at Sh\u014dheik\u014d academy\nand enrolled as a posthumous disciple of Hirata Atsutane. He served as\nan instructor to the Shirakawa family from 1863 and became the\nacademic head of the Yoshida Shinto school in 1867. During the\nRestoration and the revival of imperial rule, Harumichi worked with\nIwakura Tomomi, Tamamatsu Misao, and others in government planning and\nissuing memoranda. During the Meiji years he served in the Council of\nDivinity (Jingikan) to research genealogies at the Imperial\nHousehold Ministry.\n\nIn the twelfth month of 1867 (Keio 3), Harumichi issued his Humble\nPetition of a Fool (Kenkin sengo) just after the\nimperial court declared the \u201cRestoration of Imperial Rule\u201d\n(\u014csei fukko). This seminal treatise is a comprehensive Kokugaku prospectus on the politics of\nrestoring imperial politics, calling for a revival of ancient\ngovernment practices. Harumichi begins by declaring the Tokugawa regime\u2019s return of political authority to the imperial\ncourt to be the grandest event in over 600 years since the establishment\nof the first samurai government in the Kamakura shogunate of the late twelfth century. He then asserts three principles for imperial\ngovernance: the \u201crites\u201d (saishi) to worship gods\nand ancestors as did the ancient sage kings of China; the\n\u201cbenevolent government\u201d (jinsei) that cares for\nthe people like foremost \u201ctreasures\u201d as practiced from\nancient times according to the decree of the Imperial Ancestral Gods;\nand the \u201cauthority\u201d (ibu) to protect loyal\nsubjects and to quell those who dare to resist.\n\nHarumichi presents various proposals for the new Meiji government\nincluding the creation of a university or daigakk\u014d in\nthe palace in Kyoto. In terms of rites, he asserts the primary\nimportance of restoring the Daij\u014dsai, the inaugural Great New\nFood Festival ceremony to offer the first crops of rice to the\nancestral gods in the eleventh month following the new emperor\u2019s\nascension to the throne. For his textual authorities, Harumichi cites\nhis readings of the classical works of Japan beginning with The\nRecord of Ancient Matters (Kojiki), The Chronicles\nof Japan (Nihon shoki and Jingishiki), and\nKokugaku writings such as Motoori Norinaga\u2019s Commentaries on\nthe Record of Ancient Matters (Kojikiden) and Hirata\nAtsutane\u2019s Lectures on Ancient History\n(Koshiden). He also cites Chinese classics beginning with the\nAnalects, the Book of Filial Piety, and Six\nClassics, as well as writings of Western learning, astronomy, and\ngeography.\n\nAlthough Harumichi asserted lofty ideals for the Restoration at the\noutset, by the early years of Meiji, the state leaders increasingly\nadopted Western ideas and institutions. Furthermore, the efforts of\nradical members of the Hirata faction were suppressed and after a few\nyears the National University was closed. In disappointment, Harumichi\ncomposed the following poem:\n\n\nMy assumption\n Kashiwara no \n\nthat we were returning\n miyo ni kaeru to \n\nto the divine age of Kashiwara\n omoishi wa \n\nhas become nothing more than\n aranu yume nite \n\nthe impossible dream. \narikeru mono wo\n\n (quoted in Walthall 1998:\n301)\n\n\nHarumichi lamented that the dream of resurrecting the ideal ancient\nsociety of the seventh century shaped exclusively by Shinto and\nKokugaku doctrine would not be realized. Harumichi\u2019s sentiment\nwas shared by many others in the Hirata school.\n\n",
