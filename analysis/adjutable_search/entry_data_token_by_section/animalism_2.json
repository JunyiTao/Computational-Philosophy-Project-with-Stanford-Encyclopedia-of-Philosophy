    "main_text": "Formulating Animalism || Our Persistence\n1.2 Our Persistence\n\nWhile it is a claim about our fundamental nature that is most readily\nassociated with the name, animalism also incorporates a view about our\npersistence. Stated in its most general form, this view asserts the\nfollowing:\n\n(2)\nThe conditions\nwhose satisfaction is necessary and sufficient for a past or future\nbeing to be identical with a human person that exists now just are\nthose whose satisfaction is necessary and sufficient for a past or\nfuture being to be identical with an animal that exists\nnow.\n\n\nAll animalists subscribe to (2), so far as it goes. But it does not go\nvery far. What exactly are the conditions of (human) animal\ncontinuity? Although animalists are mostly in agreement, there is a\nsubtle and seldom acknowledged rift between two camps of animalist\nthinking about the answer to this question.\n\nAccording to the first camp, remaining alive is both a necessary and a\nsufficient condition for the persistence of human animals.\nHuman-animal persistence thus consists in the continuation of those\nprocesses constitutive of biological life. As Olson puts it,\n\u201cone survives just in case one\u2019s purely animal\nfunctions\u2014metabolism, the capacity to breathe and circulate\none\u2019s blood, and the like\u2014continue\u201d (1997: 16). On\nthis view, an animal\u2019s life is understood as\n\n\na self-organizing biological event that maintains the organism\u2019s\ncomplex internal structure. The materials that organisms are made up\nof are intrinsically unstable and must therefore be constantly\nrepaired and renewed, or else the organism dies and its remains decay.\nAn organism must constantly take in new particles, reconfigure and\nassimilate them into its living fabric, and expel those that are no\nlonger useful to it. An organism\u2019s life enables it to persist\nand retain its characteristic structure despite constant material\nturnover. (Olson 2007: 28)\n\n\nThis first animalist answer to the persistence question, then, can be\nglossed as follows:\n\n(2a)\n Given a human\nanimal, x, existing at one time, \\(t_1\\), and something,\ny, existing at a later time, \\(t_2\\), y is identical\nwith x if and only if y continues the life processes\npreviously undergone by x.\n\n\nOnce (2a) is conjoined with the animalist answer to the fundamental\nnature question, (1), we have a view that might be labeled\n\u201corganic animalism\u201d. Notable advocates of this view\ninclude Olson and van Inwagen (1990). Of course, it follows from the\norganicist view that death will constitute the end of our existence.\nWhatever else may remain following our deaths, each of us will cease\nto exist when we die. Indeed, strictly speaking on this view, there is\nno such thing as a dead animal (or perhaps\u2014if \u2018dead\u2019\nis a non-attributive adjective like \u2018fake\u2019\u2014that a\n\u201cdead animal\u201d is not an animal).\n\nThose in the second animalist camp deny that being alive is a\nnecessary condition for the persistence of human animals. On their\nview, a human animal (like all organisms) is a functionally organized\nphysical object whose membership in a particular species is attributed\nto its origin and structure. Only if it is so gruesome as to destroy\nthis structure will an organism\u2019s death bring about its\nnonexistence. We persist, David Mackie puts it, \u201cas long as this\norganisation of [our] constituent parts remains sufficiently nearly\nintact\u201d (1999b: 237).\n\nBut this focus on the functional organization of animal bodies should\nbe taken neither as discounting altogether the significance of the\nlife processes emphasized by organicists nor as affirming a\ntraditional bodily criterion of persistence. On the contrary, on this\nview, a human animal\u2019s \n\n\nlife is both a consequence or inseparable function of its origin and\nthe continuing explanation of its structure and parts at any moment of\nits existence. Life is essential to the thing in so far as it is\ninconceivable that it (this thing) should have come into existence as\na non-living thing. (Ayers 1991: vol. 2: 224)\n\n\n\u201cBut\u201d, Ayers continues, \u201cthat is not to say that\nwhen it dies the thing itself will cease to exist: merely that an\nexplanation of the existence and structure of the thing will then\nrefer to a life that is over\u201d (ibid.).\n\nIn contrast with their organicist counterparts, these animalists\nanswer the persistence question along the following lines:\n\n\nthe persistence of biological organisms depends on their retaining\n(enough of) the organisation of parts that is the product of their\nnatural biological development, and that makes them apt for life,\nwhile stopping short of saying that life itself is necessary. (D.\nMackie 1999b: 236) \n\n\nIn short:\n\n(2b)\nGiven a human\nanimal, x, existing at one time, \\(t_1\\), and something,\ny, existing at a later time, \\(t_2\\), y is identical\nwith x if and only if y retains a sufficient degree of\nthe life-apt structure of constituent parts previously exhibited by\nx.\n\n\nHereafter, \u2018somatic animalism\u2019 will refer to the\nconjunction of (1) and (2b). In addition to Ayers and Mackie, notable\nsomaticists include Carter (1989, 1999) and Feldman (1992).\n\nIt is worth emphasizing that the debate between somatic and organic\nanimalists is not merely verbal and that the sort of linguistic\nevidence sometimes marshaled (e.g., by D. Mackie 1999b) is\u2014while\ngermane\u2014unlikely to settle the question at issue. The debate\nbetween somaticist and organicist conceptions of the conditions of\nanimal continuity reflects a substantive (if, as yet, inadequately\nexplored) disagreement about the nature of (human) animals. (Are they\nessentially living? How ought life itself be understood?) Moreover,\nwhile the issue of whether something can be both an animal and dead\nillustrates the somaticist-organicist debate, it is hardly\nthe only context in which that debate manifests itself. The same\ndebate could be illustrated when considering unborn human fetuses,\nhuman animals in suspended animation, etc.\n",
