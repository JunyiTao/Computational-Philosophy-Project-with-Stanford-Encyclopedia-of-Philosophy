Machine discovery\n\nEarlier critics of AI-based theories of scientific discoveries argued\nthat a computer cannot devise new concepts but is confined to the\nconcepts included in the given computer language (Hempel 1985:\n119\u2013120). It cannot design new experiments, instruments, or\nmethods. Subsequent computational research on scientific discovery was\ndriven by the motivation to contribute computational tools to aid\nscientists in their research (Addis et al. 2016). It appears that\ncomputational methods can be used to generate new results leading to\nrefereed scientific publications in astrophysics, cancer research,\necology, and other fields (Langley 2000). However, the philosophical\ndiscussion has continued about the question of whether these methods\nreally generate new knowledge or whether they merely speed up data\nprocessing. It is also still an open question whether data-intensive\nscience is fundamentally different from traditional research, for\ninstance regarding the status of hypothesis or theory in\ndata-intensive research (Pietsch 2015). \n\nIn the wake of recent developments in machine learning, some older\ndiscussions about automated discovery have been revived. The\navailability of vastly improved computational tools and software for\ndata analysis has stimulated new discussions about computer-generated\ndiscovery (see Leonelli 2020). It is largely uncontroversial that\nmachine learning tools can aid discovery, for instance in research on\nantibiotics (Stokes et al, 2020). The notion of \u201crobot\nscientist\u201d is mostly used metaphorically, and the vision that\nhuman scientists may one day be replaced by computers \u2013 by\nsuccessors of the laboratory automation systems \u201cAdam\u201d and\n\u201cEve\u201d, allegedly the first \u201crobot scientists\u201d\n\u2013 is evoked in writings for broader audiences (see King et al.\n2009, Williams et al. 2015, for popularized descriptions of these\nsystems), although some interesting ethical challenges do arise from\n\u201csuperhuman AI\u201d (see Russell 2021). It also appears that,\non the notion that products of creative acts are both novel and\nvaluable, AI systems should be called \u201ccreative,\u201d an\nimplication which not all analysts will find plausible (Boden\n2014)\n\nPhilosophical analyses focus on various questions arising from the\nprocesses involving human-machine complexes. One issue relevant to the\nproblem of scientific discovery arises from the opacity of machine\nlearning. If machine learning indeed escapes human understanding, how\ncan we be warranted to say that knowledge or understanding is\ngenerated by deep learning tools? Might we have reason to say that\nhumans and machines are \u201cco-developers\u201d of knowledge\n(Tamaddoni-Nezhad et al. 2021)? \n",
