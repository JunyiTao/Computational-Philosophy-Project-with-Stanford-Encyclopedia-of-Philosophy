    "main_text": "Transactional Theories || Fairness\n4.2 Fairness\n\nEven if we cannot be said to have meaningfully consented to them, it\nseems clear that (reasonably just) political authorities do provide us\nwith crucially important benefits, such as security and the rule of\nlaw. Some have pointed to these benefits to justify our duty to obey\nand support the authorities in question. The core idea here is that\nthose who benefit from a fair scheme of cooperation have a duty to do\ntheir allotted part under that scheme. In other words, if others obey\nthe law to our benefit, we owe them a duty not to take a free-ride on\ntheir compliance (Hart 1955; Rawls 1964).\n\nUpon closer look, however, some of the worries that afflict consent\ntheories crop up here as well. For intuitively it\u2019s only when\nthe benefits produced by a cooperative scheme are accepted by\nits members that the existence of fair-play obligations is\nuncontroversial. If a scheme of cooperation simply thrusts benefits on\npeople as the unavoidable fall-out of the cooperative activity of\nothers\u2014even very valuable benefits\u2014it is doubtful that we\nhave a duty to comply with the scheme. However, it\u2019s unclear in\nwhat sense we can be said to have accepted the benefits provided by\nthe state. After all, the central benefits of an effective legal\nsystem, including security and order, are the sort of non-excludable\npublic goods that Simmons (1979: 138\u2013139) calls \u201copen\nbenefits\u201d. They are provided to all those living in the\nterritory over which the state claims authority, regardless of whether\nthe benefits in question are welcomed or not. Rarely can these\nbenefits be avoided, and when they can, it\u2019s only at great cost.\nMore importantly, states typically claim the same type of authority\nboth over those who accept the benefits and over those who don\u2019t\n(Nozick 1974; Rawls 1964; Simmons 2001: Chapters 1\u20132).\n\nIn reply, some have argued that although it is true that, normally,\nacceptance is required in order to incur fair-play obligations, this\nis not the case when it comes to the sort of \u201cpresumptively\nbeneficial\u201d goods that states provide. Since goods like security\nand order are necessary for any acceptable life, we can presume that\neveryone would pursue these benefits, if doing so were necessary to\nreceive them. Failing to do so would be irrational after all (Klosko\n1991, 2005; see also Arneson 1982; Dagger 1997, 2018). The problem\nwith this argument is that we often make choices that are irrational\nin this sense but\u2014leaving aside cases where paternalistic\ninterference might be justified\u2014this is normally enough to\nshield us from incurring the costs associated with making the\nreasonable choice. Although it might be irrational not to buy a\nparticular life-insurance policy, if I refuse to do so, you\u2019re\nnot allowed to provide me with the policy and expect me to pay for it.\nWhy think that refusing to accept the benefits provided by the state\nshould not protect us in the same way from incurring the costs\nattached to them? After all, these obligations are meant to rule out\nattempts to take advantage of the members of a cooperative scheme by\nexploiting their sacrifices and reaping the benefits produced by the\nscheme without bearing any of the costs associated with their\nproduction. But if I don\u2019t accept the relevant benefits because,\nperhaps foolishly, I fail to appreciate their value, I am not trying\nto take advantage of anyone.\n\nThings are more complicated than we might think at first here because\nit\u2019s not unrealistic that, at least in some cases, the rejection\nof essential open benefits that we know we are going to receive anyway\nmight be the product of motivationally-biased beliefs triggered by a\ndesire to free-ride (i.e., irrational beliefs that we have developed,\nperhaps unconsciously, in order to receive those benefits without\nhaving to contribute our fair share to their production). And\nit\u2019s plausible that when this is what explains our failure to\naccept the benefits in question, our fair-play obligations are not\nundermined (Renzo 2014). But there is no reason to think that this\nexplanation will be valid in every case in which the benefits provided\nby the state are rejected. Realistically, some cases of rejection will\nbe genuine, and in those cases, fairness seems unable to vindicate our\nobligation to obey the law.\n\nA further complication concerns the fact that, despite being\nnon-excludable in the sense that they cannot be selectively provided\nonly to those who ask for them, many of the \u201copen\nbenefits\u201d provided by states are not fairly distributed among\nall citizens. Even in societies that present themselves as liberal and\negalitarian, minorities are often discriminated against and suffer\nserious injustice at the ends of their government. When this is the\ncase, the idea that obedience might required as a way of doing\none\u2019s fair share in maintaining a cooperative scheme for\nreciprocal benefit surely lose much of its force (Shelby 2016; see\nalso Kelly 2022 and Yankah 2022).\n",
