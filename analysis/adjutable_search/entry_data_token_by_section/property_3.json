Genealogies of Property\n\nIn our philosophical tradition, arguments about the justification of\nproperty have often been presented as genealogies: as stories about\nthe way in which private property might have emerged in a world that\nwas hitherto unacquainted with the institution.\n\nThe best known are Lockean stories (Locke 1988 [1689] and Nozick\n1974). One begins with a description of a state of nature and an\ninitial premise about land belonging to nobody in particular. And then\none tells a story about why it would be sensible for individuals to\nappropriate land and other resources for their personal use and about\nthe conditions under which such appropriations would be justified.\nIndividuals have needs and they find themselves surrounded with\nobjects capable of satisfying those needs. But each person,\nX, is vaguely aware that the objects have not been furnished\nby God or nature for X\u2019s use alone; others have a need for\nthem as well. So what is X to do? One thing is clear: if\nX has to wait for some general meeting of everyone who might\nbe affected by his use of the resources in his vicinity before he is\nallowed to use them then, as Locke put it, \u2018man had starved,\nnotwithstanding the plenty God had given him\u2019 (Locke 1988\n[1689], II, para. 28). So the individual goes ahead and takes what he\nneeds (ibid., I, para. 86). He \u2018mixes his labor\u2019 with the\nobject he needs, and by doing so he fulfills his fundamental duty of\nself-preservation, while also increasing the value of the resources he\nworks on for the indirect benefit of others. The first phase of\nLocke\u2019s story involves individuals satisfying their needs out of the\ncommon largesse in this virtuous and self-reliant way. The second\nphase of the story involves their exchanging surplus goods that they\nhave appropriated with one another; rather than saying that such\nsurpluses lapse back into the common heritage, Locke allows\nindividuals to acquire, grow, or make more than they can use so that\nmarkets become possible and prosperity general (ibid., II, paras.\n46\u201351). With markets and prosperity, however, comes inequality,\navarice and envy, and the third and last stage of Locke\u2019s account is\nthe institution of government to protect the property rights that have\ngrown up in this way (ibid., II, paras. 123 ff.) The story assumes\nthat individuals are able to reason through these issues of who is\nentitled to appropriate and use and exchange goods without the\ntutelage of government, and that at neither the first stage nor the\nsecond stage is any social or political decision-making about property\nrequired.\n\nIn its most basic aspect, Locke\u2019s genealogy has the character of a\nFirst Occupancy story. In the first instance, the legitimacy of an\nindividual\u2019s appropriation stems largely from the fact that it does\nnot involve the direct expropriation of anyone else: by definition the\n\u2018first occupancy\u2019 is peaceful. There are, of course,\nstrong elements of utilitarian and virtue theory in Locke\u2019s account\ntoo\u2014the productivity of labor and the privileging of what Locke\ncalls \u2018the Industrious and the Rational\u2019 over the\n\u2018Covetousness of the Quarrelsom and Contentious\u2019 (ibid.,\nII, para. 34). But the issue of historical priority is indispensable.\nWhose use of a given resource came first is crucial, and the order in\nwhich goods were subsequently transferred from hand to hand is\nindispensable for understanding the legitimacy of current\nentitlements. Robert Nozick (1974) has done more than anyone else to\nelucidate the form of this kind of \u2018historical\nentitlement\u2019 theory.\n\nNot all genealogies of property have this shape. David Hume tells a\ncompletely different sort of story. On his approach, we begin by\nassuming that since time immemorial, people have been fighting over\nresources, so that the distribution of de facto possession at\nany given time is arbitrary, being driven by force, cunning, and luck.\nNow it is possible that such fighting will continue indefinitely. But\nit is also possible that it may settle down into a sort of stable\nequilibrium in which those in possession of significant resources and\nthose tempted to grab resources from others find that the marginal\ncosts of further predatory activity are equal to their marginal gains.\nUnder these conditions, something like a \u2018peace dividend\u2019\nmay be available. Maybe everyone can gain, in terms of the diminution\nof conflict, the stabilizing of social relations, and the prospects\nfor market exchange, by an agreement not to fight any more over\npossessions.\n\nI observe, that it will be for my interest to leave another in the\npossession of his goods, provided he will act in the same manner with\nregard to me. He is sensible of a like interest in the regulation of\nhis conduct. When this common sense of interest is mutually express\u2019d,\nand is known to both, it produces a suitable resolution and\nbehaviour\u2026 (Hume 1978 [1739], p. 490).\n\n\nSuch a resolution, if it lasts, may amount over time to a ratification\nof de facto holdings as de jure property. As with\nLocke\u2019s account, the state comes into the picture much later to\nreinforce conventions of property that emerge informally in this way\n(ibid., pp. 534 ff.). But notice how much more modest Hume\u2019s story is\nthan the Lockean account in the moral claims that it makes (see\nWaldron 1994). The stability of the emergent distribution has nothing\nto do with its justice, nor with the moral quality of the actions by\nwhich goods were appropriated. It may be fair or unfair, equal or\nunequal, but the parties already know that they cannot hope for a much\nbetter distribution by pitching their own strength yet again against\nthat of others. (See also Buchanan 1975 for a modern version of this\napproach.)\n\nAs an account of the genesis of property, Hume\u2019s theory has the\nadvantage over its main rivals of acknowledging that the early eras of\nhuman history are eras of conflict largely unregulated by principle\nand opaque to later moral enquiry. It does not require us to delve\ninto history to ascertain who did what to whom, and what would have\nhappened if they had not. Once a settled pattern of possession\nemerges, we simply draw an arbitrary line and say, \u2018Property\nentitlements start from here.\u2019 The model has important\nnormative consequences for the present as well. Those who are tempted\nto question or disrupt an existing distribution of property must\nrecognize that far from ushering in a new era of justice, their best\nefforts are likely to inaugurate an era of conflict in which all bets\nare off and in which virtually no planning or cooperation is possible.\nThe weakness of the Humean approach is the obverse of its strength.\nThe moral considerations that it marginalizes actually do matter to\nus. For example, we would not be happy with a Humean convention\nratifying slavery or cannibalism, but for all that Hume shows it may\nwell be a feature of the equilibrium emerging from the age of conflict\nthat some people are in possession of others\u2019 bodies. The point is\nthat even if Hume is right that the sentiment of justice is built up\nout of a convention to respect one another\u2019s de facto\npossessions, that sentiment once established can take on a life of its\nown, so that it can subsequently be turned against the very\nequilibrium that engendered it (Waldron 1994).\n\nA third variety of property-story makes the state and the social\ncontract more fundamental than it is in either Locke\u2019s or Hume\u2019s\napproach. We are to imagine a period where people try and rely on\ntheir own physical and moral initiative to take possession of the\nresources which they need or want, but in which it become increasingly\napparent that institution of reliable property arrangements is going\nto have to involve a social decision. Eventually property must be\nbased on consent\u2014the consent of everyone affected by decisions\nabout the use and control of a given set of resources. This theory is\nassociated with the normative political philosophy of Jean-Jacques\nRousseau (1968 [1762]) and Immanuel Kant (1991 [1797]). As we have\nseen, the Lockean critique of this sort of approach was always that\nurgency of material need left no time for social consent. In fact the\nRousseau/Kant approach has little difficulty with this point. There\ncan be provisional appropriations made unilaterally (Ryan 1984, p.\n80). But every such appropriation is subject in principle to the\nconsent of all and must be offered up for social ratification. In\nother words, the urgency of immediate need is not taken as a basis of\ndiscrediting the review and redistribution of possession by society as\na whole if serious distributive anomalies are emerging.\n\nWhat all this actually yields in the way of a legitimate assignment of\nresources to individuals is a matter of the distributive principles\nthat survive the test of ratification by the general will. Rawlsian,\negalitarian and utilitarian approaches are all imaginable under the\nauspices of this account. The essence of the Rousseau/Kant approach is\nthat society\u2019s deployment of principles like these to evaluate\nexisting distributions is never trumped by the history of entitlements\nand it is never excluded by the Humean conventions that may have\nemerged as a cosy equilibrium among those who are actually in\npossession.\n\nWhat claims are being made in and about these stories? Are we to\nassume that one of them is literally true? Or what are we to infer\nfrom their falsity (if they are historically inaccurate)? Does it\nfollow that property is illegitimate? A number of philosophers have\nsuggested recently that a genealogy can make an important contribution\nto our understanding of a phenomenon even when it is not literally\ntrue: Bernard Williams (2002) has suggested this about language and\nthe emergence of truth-telling, following Edward Craig (1990)\u2019s\ngenealogical account of our possession of the concept of knowledge.\nRobert Nozick has also discussed the value of what he calls\n\u2018potential explanations\u2019\u2014stories that would explain\nhow something happened if certain things were the case (some of which\nin fact are not the case): \u2018To see how in principle, a whole\nrealm could fundamentally be explained greatly increases our\nunderstanding of the realm\u2026We learn much by seeing how the\nstate could have arisen, even if it didn\u2019t arise that way\u2019\n(Nozick 1974, pp. 8\u20139).\n\nThe genealogies we have considered may differ in this regard. The\nRousseau/Kant approach helps us understand why private property is\ninherently a matter of social concern and the Humean approach helps us\nsee the value of property in providing people with a fixed and\nmutually acknowledged basis on which the rest of social life can be\nbuilt, whether or not it answers to our independent intuitions of\njustice. But the Lockean genealogy may explain little or nothing about\nproperty entitlements unless it is actually true. As Nozick\nacknowledges (1974, pp. 151\u20132), a modern state should not feel\nmorally constrained by property holdings which might have had a\nLockean pedigree but in fact do not. In this regard it is interesting\nthat one of the main uses of Lockean theory these days is in defending\nthe property rights of indigenous people\u2014where a literal claim\nis being made about who had first possession of a set of resources and\nabout the need to rectify the injustices that accompanied their\nsubsequent expropriation (see Waldron 1992).\n\nFinally, we should not forget that not all genealogies set out to\nflatter the practices or institutions they purport to explain. Karl\nMarx\u2019s account of primitive accumulation (1976 [1867]) and\nJean-Jacques Rousseau\u2019s non-normative description of the invention of\nproperty in the Discourse on the Origins of Inequality\n(Rousseau 1994 [1755]) are genealogies written more in a Nietzschean\nspirit of pathology than as part of any quest for justification. Such\nnegative genealogies reminds us of the importance of Mill\u2019s\nobservation that in approaching the justification of private property\nwe must remember that, \u2018we must leave out of consideration its\nactual origin in any of the existing nations of Europe\u2019 (Mill\n1994 [1848], p. 7).\n",
