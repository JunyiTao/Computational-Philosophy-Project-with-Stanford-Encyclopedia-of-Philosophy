    "main_text": "Eliminative vs. Non-Eliminative Structuralism || Consolidation and Further Discussions in the 1980s\n1.2 Consolidation and Further Discussions in the 1980s\n\nOne way to understand Benacerraf\u2019s discussion in his 1965\narticle is that he proposes to treat the natural number structure as a\nnew kind of abstract entity, different from set-theoretic objects and\nsystems of objects. All depends then on what exactly that amounts to,\nincluding whether one should treat such structures as objects\nthemselves, thus reifying them in some substantive and still to be\nworked out way, or not. Benacerraf himself was reluctant to do the\nlatter, in line with his overall hesitancy to talk about mathematical\nobjects. \n\nOne subsequent writer who picked up on Benacerraf\u2019s ideas in the\nearly 1980s and tried to spell them out further, while still\nrefraining from treating structures as full-fledged objects, is\nMichael Resnik (cf. Resnik 1981, 1982, 1988, and, most systematically,\n1997). For him too, modern mathematics involves a \u201cstructuralist\nperspective\u201d.  This includes a kind of pattern recognition; and\none of Resnik\u2019s main goals is to spell out the corresponding\nepistemology further. Along Benacerraf\u2019s lines, mathematical\nobjects are viewed as \u201cpositions\u201d in corresponding\npatterns; and this is meant to allow us to take mathematical\nstatements \u201cat face value\u201d, in the sense of seeing\n\u20180\u2019, \u20181\u2019, \u20182\u2019, etc. as singular\nterms referring to such positions.  At the same time, doing so is not\nsupposed to require reifying the underlying structures, which would\nmean specifying precise criteria of identity for them, something\nResnik avoids intentionally. (He presents himself as a Quinean on this\npoint, in the sense of adopting Quine\u2019s slogan: \u201cNo entity\nwithout identity!\u201d)\n\nStewart Shapiro is a second philosopher of mathematics who, in the\nearly 1980s, attempts to build on Benacerraf\u2019s paper (see\nShapiro 1983, 1989, and most systematically, Shapiro 1997). By\nfocusing more on metaphysical questions and leaving behind hesitations\nabout structures as objects, Shapiro\u2019s goal is to defend a more\nthoroughly realist version of mathematical structuralism, thus\nrejecting nominalist and constructivist views (more on that\nbelow). Such realism includes the semantic aspect mentioned above\n(taking mathematical statements at face value); but Shapiro also wants\nto clarify the talk about \u201cpositions in structures\u201d\nfurther.  He distinguishes two perspectives on them. According to the\nfirst, the positions at issue are treated as \u201coffices\u201d,\ni.e., as slots that can be filled or occupied by various objects\n(e.g., the position \u201c0\u201d in the natural number structure is\noccupied by \\(\\emptyset\\) in the series of finite von Neumann\nordinals).  According to the second perspective, the positions are\ntreated as \u201cobjects\u201d themselves; and so are the abstract\nstructures.\n\nFor Shapiro, the structures at issue thus have a dual nature: they are\n\u201cuniversals\u201d, in the sense that the natural number\nstructure, say, can be instantiated by various relational systems (the\nsystem consisting of the finite von Neumann ordinals, or of the\nZermelo ordinals, etc.); but they are also \u201cparticulars\u201d,\nto be named by singular terms and treated as objects themselves. To\ndefend the latter further, Shapiro develops a general structure\ntheory, i.e., an axiomatic theory that specifies which structures\nexist. While modeled on set theory, this theory is justified\nindependently (more on how below). As such, it is meant to underwrite\n\u201cante rem structuralism\u201d.  Shapiro\u2019s\nterminology of \u201cante rem versus in re\u201d\ninvolves an explicit reference to Medieval discussions of universals.\nThe crucial point in our context is that the structures specified in\nhis theory are meant to be ontologically independent of, indeed\nprior to, any instantiations of them. In other\nwords, the structures do not just exist \nin their instantiations, but separate to and \nbefore them. \n\nWhile Resnik\u2019s and Shapiro\u2019s structuralist positions are\nsometimes identified, this is somewhat misleading given the\ndifferences already mentioned. Nevertheless, there is significant\noverlap. Both recognize mathematical structures as certain patterns\nwith positions in them etc. (whether these patterns are then treated\nas full-fledged objects, in a realist sense, or not). And for both\nResnik and Shapiro, the notion of isomorphism is crucial (or some\nrelated, more general notion of equivalence; see Resnik 1997 and\nShapiro 1997). That is to say, for both a relevant structure/pattern\ncan be instantiated by any of a relevant class of isomorphic\nrelational systems. This corresponds to the fact that the axiomatic\nsystems at issue, for the natural numbers, the real numbers, and\nsimilar cases, are all categorical (or quasi-categorical in the case\nof set theory). Not every mathematical axiom system has that feature,\nof course, e.g., the axiom systems for group or ring theory allow for\nnon-isomorphic instances or models. For Resnik as well as Shapiro,\nsuch \u201calgebraic\u201d theories are to be treated in a\ndifferent, more derivative way; their structuralist point of view is\nmeant to apply primarily to \u201cnon-algebraic\u201d theories,\nparadigmatically arithmetic.\n\nThere is another structuralist position from the 1980s that is quite\ndifferent and explicitly not realist, namely that introduced by\nGeoffrey Hellman (cf. Hellman 1989, 1996, and later articles). While\nfor Resnik and Shapiro the inspiration was Benacerraf\u2019s 1965\narticle, the starting point for Hellman is Putnam\u2019s 1967\narticle. In fact, Hellman\u2019s \u201cmodal structuralism\u201d is\nmeant to be a systematic development of Putnam\u2019s modalized\nif-then-ism.  The modal aspect is now spelled out in detail and with\nreal ingenuity, including for the case of set theory (building on work\nby Zermelo etc.). For Hellman, a sentence such as\n\u201c\\(2+3\n= 5\\)\u201d is analyzed as follows: \n\n\nNecessarily, for all relational systems M, if M is a\nmodel of the Dedekind-Peano axioms, then \\(2_M +3_M =5_M\\). \n\n\nTo avoid the non-vacuity problem, he adds the following\nassumption:\n\n\nPossibly, there exists an M such that M is a model of\nthe Dedekind-Peano axioms. \n\n(We will come back to its justification below.)\n\nAs Hellman makes clear, his goal is to develop a form of\n\u201cstructuralism without structures\u201d (Hellman 1996), since\nthe existence of abstract structures, postulated by Resnik and\nShapiro, is replaced by the modal aspects of his position (and\ncorresponding assumptions about necessity and possibility). In fact,\nHellman\u2019s position is meant to be a form of nominalism, i.e., to\neliminate the appeal to any kind of abstract entity (not only abstract\nstructures but also sets etc.). Yet it is also not meant to rely\non possibilia, i.e., possible objects existing in some\nshadowy sense. This leads Hellman to a specific understanding of the\nmodalities at issue. They are meant to be basic, i.e., the relevant\npossibilities and necessities are not reducible to anything\nfurther. On the other hand, they are specified precisely in terms of\nlaws of modal logic (those of the system S5).\n",
