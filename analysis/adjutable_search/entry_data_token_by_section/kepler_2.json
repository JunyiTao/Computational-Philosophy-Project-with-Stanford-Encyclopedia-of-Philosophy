The five regular solids\n\nPhilosophical, geometrical and even theological speculations related\nto the five regular polyhedra, the cube or hexahedron, the\ntetrahedron, the octahedron, the icosahedron and the dodecahedron,\nwere known at least from the time of the ancient Pythagoreans. Since\nPlato\u2019s Timaeus, these five geometrical solids played a\nleading role, and for the later tradition they became known as the\n\u201cfive Platonic solids\u201d.\n\n\nFigure 1.\nTable 3 in Mysterium Cosmographicum, with Kepler\u2019s\nmodel illustrating the intercalation of the five regular solids\nbetween the imaginary spheres of the planets (cf. KGW 1,\npp. 26\u201327).\n\n\nPlato establishes at the physical and chemical level a correspondence\nbetween them and the five elements\u2014earth, water, air, fire and\nether\u2014and tries to provide this correspondence with geometrical\ngrounds. A further source of historically decisive importance is the\nfact that the five regular polyhedra are treated in Euclid\u2019s\nElements of Geometry, a work that for Kepler, especially in\nthe Platonic approach of Proclus, has a central position. At the very\nbeginning of HM Kepler complains about the fact that the modern\nphilosophical and mathematical school of Peter Ramus (1515\u20131572)\nhad not been able to understand the architectonic structure of the\nElements, which are crowned with the treatment of the five\nregular polyhedra. In addition, a revival of Platonic philosophy was\ntaking place in Kepler\u2019s time and inspired not only philosophers\nand mathematicians but also architects, artists and illustrators (see\nField 1997).\n\nAmidst this general interest in the regular polyhedra during the\nRenaissance, Kepler was specifically concerned with their application\nin the resolution of a cosmological problem, namely the reality of the\nCopernican system (see Section 5 below). To achieve this goal, he\nintroduced his polyhedral hypothesis already in MC, where he looked\nfor an \u201ca priori\u201d foundation of the Copernican system (see\nAiton 1977, Di Liscia 2009). The background for such an approach seems\nto be that the \u201ca posteriori\u201d way, which according to\nKepler was taken over by Copernicus himself, cannot lead to a\nnecessary affirmation of the reality of the new world system, but only\nto a probable, and hence to an \u201cinstrumental\u201d,\nrepresentation of it as a computational device. This is the\n\u201cOsiander\u201d or \u201cWittenberg Interpretation\u201d of\nCopernicus which Kepler directly attacked not only in his MC but also\nlater in his AN (see Westman 1972, 1975 and 2011). In MC, he claimed\nto have found an answer to the following three main questions: 1) the\nnumber of the planets; 2) the size of the orbits, i.e., the distances;\n3) the velocities of the planets in their orbits. By referring to the\npolyhedral hypothesis (see Figure 1), Kepler found a definitive and\nsimple answer to the first question. By intercalating the polyhedra\nbetween the spheres which carry the planets, one must inevitably\nfinish with the sphere of Saturn surrounding the cube\u2014there are\nno more polyhedra to be intercalated and, as remains the standard case\nfor Renaissance and modern astronomy, there are no more planets to be\ncarried by the spheres. It is absolutely decisive for the consistency\nof the argument that the necessity of the hypothesis is guaranteed by\nthe fact that it already exists as a mathematical demonstration (by\nEuclid, Elements XIII, prop. 18, schol.), according to which\nthere are only five regular (\u201cPlatonic\u201d for the tradition)\npolyhedra. For the second and third questions the answer is, of\ncourse, not as evident as for the first one. However, Kepler was able\nto show that distances which are derived from the geometrical model of\nthe five regular bodies fit much better with the Copernican system\nthan with that of Ptolemy. The answer to the third question needs, in\naddition, the introduction of a notion of power that emanates from the\nSun and extends to the outer limit of the universe (see Stephenson\n1987, pp. 9\u201320).\n\nIn HM, Kepler continues his investigations of the polyhedra at a\ncosmological as well as a mathematical level. In the second book,\ndealing with \u201ccongruence\u201d (which here does not mean, as it\ndoes today, \u201cthe same size and shape\u201d, but the property of\nfigures filling the surface together with other regular polygons\n\u2013 on the plane\u2014or, to build closed geometric solids\n\u2013 hence, in space), Kepler made new mathematical discoveries\nworking with tessellations. He discovered two new solids, the\nso-called \u201csmall and great stellated dodecahedrons\u201d.\n\nThe treatment of the regular polyhedra constitutes one of the two\nprincipal pillars of HM, Book 5 (chapters 1\u20132), where the third\nlaw is formulated (see Caspar in KGW 6, Nachbericht, p. 497, and Engl.\ntrans. p. xxxiii). Following his approach from MC and complementing it\nwith occasional references to his EAC, Kepler makes use again of the\nPlatonic solids to determine the number of the planets and their\ndistances from the Sun. Meanwhile, he has learned that the application\nof his old polyhedral hypothesis has limits. As he tells us in a\nfootnote in the second edition of his MC from 1621, he was earlier\nconvinced of the possibility of explaining the eccentricities of the\nplanetary orbits by values derived \u201ca priori\u201d from this\nhypothesis (MC, Engl. trans., p. 189). Now, with access to the\nobservational data of Tycho, Kepler had to exclude this explanation\nand look for another. And this is one of the most significant\nachievements of his basic harmonies (which in turn are derived from\nthe regular polygons), constituting the second great pillar of Book\n5.\n",
