Objections to virtue ethics\n\nA number of objections have been raised against virtue ethics, some of\nwhich bear more directly on one form of virtue ethics than on others.\nIn this section we consider eight objections, namely, the a)\napplication, b) adequacy, c) relativism, d) conflict, e)\nself-effacement, f) justification, g) egoism, and h) situationist\nproblems.\n\na) In the early days of virtue ethics\u2019 revival, the approach was\nassociated with an \u201canti-codifiability\u201d thesis about\nethics, directed against the prevailing pretensions of normative\ntheory. At the time, utilitarians and deontologists commonly (though\nnot universally) held that the task of ethical theory was to come up\nwith a code consisting of universal rules or principles (possibly only\none, as in the case of act-utilitarianism) which would have two\nsignificant features: i) the rule(s) would amount to a decision\nprocedure for determining what the right action was in any particular\ncase; ii) the rule(s) would be stated in such terms that any\nnon-virtuous person could understand and apply it (them)\ncorrectly.\n\nVirtue ethicists maintained, contrary to these two claims, that it was\nquite unrealistic to imagine that there could be such a code (see, in\nparticular, McDowell 1979). The results of attempts to produce and\nemploy such a code, in the heady days of the 1960s and 1970s, when\nmedical and then bioethics boomed and bloomed, tended to support the\nvirtue ethicists\u2019 claim. More and more utilitarians and\ndeontologists found themselves agreed on their general rules but on\nopposite sides of the controversial moral issues in contemporary\ndiscussion. It came to be recognised that moral sensitivity,\nperception, imagination, and judgement informed by\nexperience\u2014phronesis in short\u2014is needed to apply\nrules or principles correctly. Hence many (though by no means all)\nutilitarians and deontologists have explicitly abandoned (ii) and much\nless emphasis is placed on (i).\n\nNevertheless, the complaint that virtue ethics does not produce\ncodifiable principles is still a commonly voiced criticism of the\napproach, expressed as the objection that it is, in principle, unable\nto provide action-guidance.\n\nInitially, the objection was based on a misunderstanding. Blinkered by\nslogans that described virtue ethics as \u201cconcerned with Being\nrather than Doing,\u201d as addressing \u201cWhat sort of\nperson should I be?\u201d but not \u201cWhat should I do?\u201d as\nbeing \u201cagent-centered rather than act-centered,\u201d its\ncritics maintained that it was unable to provide\naction-guidance. Hence, rather than being a normative rival to\nutilitarian and deontological ethics, it could claim to be no more\nthan a valuable supplement to them. The rather odd idea was that all\nvirtue ethics could offer was, \u201cIdentify a moral exemplar and do\nwhat he would do,\u201d as though the university student trying\nto decide whether to study music (her preference) or engineering (her\nparents\u2019 preference) was supposed to ask herself, \u201cWhat\nwould Socrates study if he were in my circumstances?\u201d\n\nBut the objection failed to take note of Anscombe\u2019s hint that a\ngreat deal of specific action guidance could be found in rules\nemploying the virtue and vice terms (\u201cv-rules\u201d) such as\n\u201cDo what is honest/charitable; do not do what is\ndishonest/uncharitable\u201d (Hursthouse 1999). (It is a noteworthy\nfeature of our virtue and vice vocabulary that, although our list of\ngenerally recognised virtue terms is comparatively short, our list of\nvice terms is remarkably, and usefully, long, far exceeding anything\nthat anyone who thinks in terms of standard deontological rules has\never come up with. Much invaluable action guidance comes from avoiding\ncourses of action that would be irresponsible, feckless, lazy,\ninconsiderate, uncooperative, harsh, intolerant, selfish, mercenary,\nindiscreet, tactless, arrogant, unsympathetic, cold, incautious,\nunenterprising, pusillanimous, feeble, presumptuous, rude,\nhypocritical, self-indulgent, materialistic, grasping, short-sighted,\nvindictive, calculating, ungrateful, grudging, brutal, profligate,\ndisloyal, and on and on.)\n\n(b) A closely related objection has to do with whether virtue ethics\ncan provide an adequate account of right action. This worry can take\ntwo forms. (i) One might think a virtue ethical account of right\naction is extensionally inadequate. It is possible to perform a right\naction without being virtuous and a virtuous person can occasionally\nperform the wrong action without that calling her virtue into\nquestion. If virtue is neither necessary nor sufficient for right\naction, one might wonder whether the relationship between\nrightness/wrongness and virtue/vice is close enough for the former to\nbe identified in terms of the latter. (ii) Alternatively, even if one\nthought it possible to produce a virtue ethical account that picked\nout all (and only) right actions, one might still think that at least\nin some cases virtue is not what explains rightness (Adams\n2006:6\u20138).\n\nSome virtue ethicists respond to the adequacy objection by rejecting\nthe assumption that virtue ethics ought to be in the business of\nproviding an account of right action in the first place. Following in\nthe footsteps of Anscombe (1958) and MacIntyre (1985), Talbot Brewer\n(2009) argues that to work with the categories of rightness and\nwrongness is already to get off on the wrong foot. Contemporary\nconceptions of right and wrong action, built as they are around a\nnotion of moral duty that presupposes a framework of divine (or moral)\nlaw or around a conception of obligation that is defined in contrast\nto self-interest, carry baggage the virtue ethicist is better off\nwithout. Virtue ethics can address the questions of how one should\nlive, what kind of person one should become, and even what one should\ndo without that committing it to providing an account of \u2018right\naction\u2019. One might choose, instead, to work with aretaic\nconcepts (defined in terms of virtues and vices) and axiological\nconcepts (defined in terms of good and bad, better and worse) and\nleave out deontic notions (like right/wrong action, duty, and\nobligation) altogether.\n\nOther virtue ethicists wish to retain the concept of right action but\nnote that in the current philosophical discussion a number of distinct\nqualities march under that banner. In some contexts, \u2018right\naction\u2019 identifies the best action an agent might perform in the\ncircumstances. In others, it designates an action that is commendable\n(even if not the best possible). In still others, it picks out actions\nthat are not blameworthy (even if not commendable). A virtue ethicist\nmight choose to define one of these\u2014for example, the best\naction\u2014in terms of virtues and vices, but appeal to other\nnormative concepts\u2014such as legitimate expectations\u2014when\ndefining other conceptions of right action.\n\nAs we observed in section 2, a virtue ethical account need not attempt\nto reduce all other normative concepts to virtues and vices.\nWhat is required is simply (i) that virtue is not reduced to\nsome other normative concept that is taken to be more fundamental and\n(ii) that some other normative concepts are explained in\nterms of virtue and vice. This takes the sting out of the adequacy\nobjection, which is most compelling against versions of virtue ethics\nthat attempt to define all of the senses of \u2018right action\u2019\nin terms of virtues. Appealing to virtues and vices makes it\nmuch easier to achieve extensional adequacy. Making room for normative\nconcepts that are not taken to be reducible to virtue and vice\nconcepts makes it even easier to generate a theory that is both\nextensionally and explanatorily adequate. Whether one needs other\nconcepts and, if so, how many, is still a matter of debate among\nvirtue ethicists, as is the question of whether virtue ethics even\nought to be offering an account of right action. Either way virtue\nethicists have resources available to them to address the adequacy\nobjection.\n\nInsofar as the different versions of virtue ethics all retain an\nemphasis on the virtues, they are open to the familiar problem of (c)\nthe charge of cultural relativity. Is it not the case that different\ncultures embody different virtues, (MacIntyre 1985) and hence that the\nv-rules will pick out actions as right or wrong only relative to a\nparticular culture? Different replies have been made to this charge.\nOne\u2014the tu quoque, or \u201cpartners in crime\u201d\nresponse\u2014exhibits a quite familiar pattern in virtue\nethicists\u2019 defensive strategy (Solomon 1988). They admit that,\nfor them, cultural relativism is a challenge, but point out\nthat it is just as much a problem for the other two approaches. The\n(putative) cultural variation in character traits regarded as virtues\nis no greater\u2014indeed markedly less\u2014than the cultural\nvariation in rules of conduct, and different cultures have different\nideas about what constitutes happiness or welfare. That cultural\nrelativity should be a problem common to all three approaches is\nhardly surprising. It is related, after all, to the\n\u201cjustification problem\u201d\n (see below)\n the quite general metaethical problem of justifying one\u2019s moral\nbeliefs to those who disagree, whether they be moral sceptics,\npluralists or from another culture.\n\nA bolder strategy involves claiming that virtue ethics has less\ndifficulty with cultural relativity than the other two approaches.\nMuch cultural disagreement arises, it may be claimed, from local\nunderstandings of the virtues, but the virtues themselves are not\nrelative to culture (Nussbaum 1993).\n\nAnother objection to which the tu quoque response is\npartially appropriate is (d) \u201cthe conflict problem.\u201d What\ndoes virtue ethics have to say about dilemmas\u2014cases in which,\napparently, the requirements of different virtues conflict because\nthey point in opposed directions? Charity prompts me to kill the\nperson who would be better off dead, but justice forbids it. Honesty\npoints to telling the hurtful truth, kindness and compassion to\nremaining silent or even lying. What shall I do? Of course, the same\nsorts of dilemmas are generated by conflicts between deontological\nrules. Deontology and virtue ethics share the conflict problem (and\nare happy to take it on board rather than follow some of the\nutilitarians in their consequentialist resolutions of such dilemmas)\nand in fact their strategies for responding to it are parallel. Both\naim to resolve a number of dilemmas by arguing that the conflict is\nmerely apparent; a discriminating understanding of the virtues or\nrules in question, possessed only by those with practical wisdom, will\nperceive that, in this particular case, the virtues do not make\nopposing demands or that one rule outranks another, or has a certain\nexception clause built into it. Whether this is all there is to it\ndepends on whether there are any irresolvable dilemmas. If there are,\nproponents of either normative approach may point out reasonably that\nit could only be a mistake to offer a resolution of what is, ex\nhypothesi, irresolvable.\n\nAnother problem arguably shared by all three approaches is (e), that\nof being self-effacing. An ethical theory is self-effacing if,\nroughly, whatever it claims justifies a particular action, or makes it\nright, had better not be the agent\u2019s motive for doing it.\nMichael Stocker (1976) originally introduced it as a problem for\ndeontology and consequentialism. He pointed out that the agent who,\nrightly, visits a friend in hospital will rather lessen the impact of\nhis visit on her if he tells her either that he is doing it because it\nis his duty or because he thought it would maximize the general\nhappiness. But as Simon Keller observes, she won\u2019t be any better\npleased if he tells her that he is visiting her because it is what a\nvirtuous agent would do, so virtue ethics would appear to have the\nproblem too (Keller 2007). However, virtue ethics\u2019 defenders\nhave argued that not all forms of virtue ethics are subject to this\nobjection (Pettigrove 2011) and those that are are not seriously\nundermined by the problem (Martinez 2011).\n\nAnother problem for virtue ethics, which is shared by both\nutilitarianism and deontology, is (f)\n \u201cthe justification problem.\u201d\n Abstractly conceived, this is the problem of how we justify or ground\nour ethical beliefs, an issue that is hotly debated at the level of\nmetaethics. In its particular versions, for deontology there is the\nquestion of how to justify its claims that certain moral rules are the\ncorrect ones, and for utilitarianism of how to justify its claim that\nall that really matters morally are consequences for happiness or\nwell-being. For virtue ethics, the problem concerns the question of\nwhich character traits are the virtues.\n\nIn the metaethical debate, there is widespread disagreement about the\npossibility of providing an external foundation for\nethics\u2014\u201cexternal\u201d in the sense of being external to\nethical beliefs\u2014and the same disagreement is found amongst\ndeontologists and utilitarians. Some believe that their normative\nethics can be placed on a secure basis, resistant to any form of\nscepticism, such as what anyone rationally desires, or would accept or\nagree on, regardless of their ethical outlook; others that it\ncannot.\n\nVirtue ethicists have eschewed any attempt to ground virtue ethics in\nan external foundation while continuing to maintain that their claims\ncan be validated. Some follow a form of Rawls\u2019s coherentist\napproach (Slote 2001; Swanton 2003); neo-Aristotelians a form of\nethical naturalism.\n\nA misunderstanding of eudaimonia as an unmoralized concept\nleads some critics to suppose that the neo-Aristotelians are\nattempting to ground their claims in a scientific account of human\nnature and what counts, for a human being, as flourishing. Others\nassume that, if this is not what they are doing, they cannot be\nvalidating their claims that, for example, justice, charity, courage,\nand generosity are virtues. Either they are illegitimately helping\nthemselves to Aristotle\u2019s discredited natural teleology\n(Williams 1985) or producing mere rationalizations of their own\npersonal or culturally inculcated values. But McDowell, Foot,\nMacIntyre and Hursthouse have all outlined versions of a third way\nbetween these two extremes. Eudaimonia in virtue ethics, is\nindeed a moralized concept, but it is not only that. Claims about what\nconstitutes flourishing for human beings no more float free of\nscientific facts about what human beings are like than ethological\nclaims about what constitutes flourishing for elephants. In both\ncases, the truth of the claims depends in part on what kind\nof animal they are and what capacities, desires and interests the\nhumans or elephants have.\n\nThe best available science today (including evolutionary theory and\npsychology) supports rather than undermines the ancient Greek\nassumption that we are social animals, like elephants and wolves and\nunlike polar bears. No rationalizing explanation in terms of anything\nlike a social contract is needed to explain why we choose to live\ntogether, subjugating our egoistic desires in order to secure the\nadvantages of co-operation. Like other social animals, our natural\nimpulses are not solely directed towards our own pleasures and\npreservation, but include altruistic and cooperative ones.\n\nThis basic fact about us should make more comprehensible the claim\nthat the virtues are at least partially constitutive of human\nflourishing and also undercut the objection that virtue ethics is, in\nsome sense, egoistic.\n\n(g) The egoism objection has a number of sources. One is a simple\nconfusion. Once it is understood that the fully virtuous agent\ncharacteristically does what she should without inner conflict, it is\ntriumphantly asserted that \u201cshe is only doing what she\nwants to do and hence is being selfish.\u201d So when the\ngenerous person gives gladly, as the generous are wont to do, it turns\nout she is not generous and unselfish after all, or at least not as\ngenerous as the one who greedily wants to hang on to everything she\nhas but forces herself to give because she thinks she should! A\nrelated version ascribes bizarre reasons to the virtuous agent,\nunjustifiably assuming that she acts as she does because she\nbelieves that acting thus on this occasion will help her to achieve\neudaimonia. But \u201cthe virtuous agent\u201d is just\n\u201cthe agent with the virtues\u201d and it is part of our\nordinary understanding of the virtue terms that each carries with it\nits own typical range of reasons for acting. The virtuous agent acts\nas she does because she believes that someone\u2019s suffering will\nbe averted, or someone benefited, or the truth established, or a debt\nrepaid, or \u2026 thereby.\n\nIt is the exercise of the virtues during one\u2019s life that is held\nto be at least partially constitutive of eudaimonia, and this\nis consistent with recognising that bad luck may land the virtuous\nagent in circumstances that require her to give up her life. Given the\nsorts of considerations that courageous, honest, loyal, charitable\npeople wholeheartedly recognise as reasons for action, they may find\nthemselves compelled to face danger for a worthwhile end, to speak out\nin someone\u2019s defence, or refuse to reveal the names of their\ncomrades, even when they know that this will inevitably lead to their\nexecution, to share their last crust and face starvation. On the view\nthat the exercise of the virtues is necessary but not sufficient for\neudaimonia, such cases are described as those in which the\nvirtuous agent sees that, as things have unfortunately turned out,\neudaimonia is not possible for them (Foot 2001, 95). On the\nStoical view that it is both necessary and sufficient, a\neudaimon life is a life that has been successfully lived\n(where \u201csuccess\u201d of course is not to be understood in a\nmaterialistic way) and such people die knowing not only that they have\nmade a success of their lives but that they have also brought their\nlives to a markedly successful completion. Either way, such heroic\nacts can hardly be regarded as egoistic.\n\nA lingering suggestion of egoism may be found in the misconceived\ndistinction between so-called \u201cself-regarding\u201d and\n\u201cother-regarding\u201d virtues. Those who have been insulated\nfrom the ancient tradition tend to regard justice and benevolence as\nreal virtues, which benefit others but not their possessor, and\nprudence, fortitude and providence (the virtue whose opposite is\n\u201cimprovidence\u201d or being a spendthrift) as not real virtues\nat all because they benefit only their possessor. This is a mistake on\ntwo counts. Firstly, justice and benevolence do, in general, benefit\ntheir possessors, since without them eudaimonia is not\npossible. Secondly, given that we live together, as social animals,\nthe \u201cself-regarding\u201d virtues do benefit others\u2014those\nwho lack them are a great drain on, and sometimes grief to, those who\nare close to them (as parents with improvident or imprudent adult\noffspring know only too well).\n\nThe most recent objection (h) to virtue ethics claims that work in\n\u201csituationist\u201d social psychology shows that there are no\nsuch things as character traits and thereby no such things as virtues\nfor virtue ethics to be about (Doris 1998; Harman 1999). In reply,\nsome virtue ethicists have argued that the social psychologists\u2019\nstudies are irrelevant to the multi-track disposition (see above) that\na virtue is supposed to be (Sreenivasan 2002; Kamtekar 2004). Mindful\nof just how multi-track it is, they agree that it would be reckless in\nthe extreme to ascribe a demanding virtue such as charity to people of\nwhom they know no more than that they have exhibited conventional\ndecency; this would indeed be \u201ca fundamental attribution\nerror.\u201d Others have worked to develop alternative, empirically\ngrounded conceptions of character traits (Snow 2010; Miller 2013 and\n2014; however see Upton 2016 for objections to Miller). There have\nbeen other responses as well (summarized helpfully in Prinz 2009 and\nMiller 2014). Notable among these is a response by Adams (2006,\nechoing Merritt 2000) who steers a middle road between \u201cno\ncharacter traits at all\u201d and the exacting standard of the\nAristotelian conception of virtue which, because of its emphasis on\nphronesis, requires a high level of character integration. On his\nconception, character traits may be \u201cfrail and\nfragmentary\u201d but still virtues, and not uncommon. But giving up\nthe idea that practical wisdom is the heart of all the virtues, as\nAdams has to do, is a substantial sacrifice, as Russell (2009) and\nKamtekar (2010) argue.\n\nEven though the \u201csituationist challenge\u201d has left\ntraditional virtue ethicists unmoved, it has generated a healthy\nengagement with empirical psychological literature, which has also\nbeen fuelled by the growing literature on Foot\u2019s Natural\nGoodness and, quite independently, an upsurge of interest in\ncharacter education (see below).\n",
