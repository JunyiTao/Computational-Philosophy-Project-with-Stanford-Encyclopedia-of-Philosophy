Representationalism and Phenomenalism\n\nAmong realists about non-conceptual representations, the central\ndivision is between representationalists (also called\n\u201crepresentationists\u201d and \u201cintentionalists\u201d)\n\u2013 e.g., Dretske (1995), Harman (1990), Leeds (1993), Lycan\n(1987, 1996), Rey (1991), Thau (2002), Tye (1995, 2000, 2009) \u2013\nand phenomenalists (also called \u201cphenomenists\u201d)\n\u2013 e.g., Block (1996, 2003), Chalmers (1996, 2004), Evans (1982),\nLoar (2003a, 2003b), Peacocke (1983, 1989, 1992, 2001), Raffman\n(1995), Shoemaker (1990). Representationalists claim that the\nphenomenal content of a non-conceptual representation \u2013 i.e.,\nits phenomenal character \u2013 is reducible to a kind of intentional\ncontent, naturalistically construed (\u00e0 la Dretske). On this\nview, phenomenal contents are extrinsic properties represented by\nnon-conceptual representations. In contrast, phenomenalists claim that\nthe phenomenal content of a non-conceptual mental representation is\nidentical to its intrinsic phenomenal properties.\n\nThe representationalist thesis is often formulated as the claim that\nphenomenal properties are representational or intentional. However,\nthis formulation is ambiguous between a reductive and a non-reductive\nclaim (though the term \u2018representationalism\u2019 is most often\nused for the reductive claim. See Chalmers 2004a). As a reductive\nclaim, it means that the phenomenal content of an experience, the\nproperties that characterize what it is like to have it (i.e.,\nqualia), are certain extrinsic properties it represents. For\nexample, the blueness one might mention in describing one\u2019s\nexperience (perceptual representation) of a clear sky at noon is a\nproperty of the sky, not of one\u2019s experience of it. Blueness is\nrelevant to the characterization of one\u2019s experience because\none\u2019s experience represents it, not because one\u2019s\nexperience instantiates it. An experience of the sky no more\ninstantiates blueness than a thought that snow is cold instantiates\ncoldness. On this view, the phenomenal content of sensory experience\nis explained as its representation of extrinsic properties. (See Byrne\nand Tye 2006, Dretske 1995, Harman 1990, Lycan 1987, 1996 and Tye\n2014, 2015 for elaboration and defense of this \u201cqualia\nexternalism.\u201d See Thompson 2008 and Pitt 2017 for objections to\nthis account.) (See also the entry on\n representational theories of consciousness.)\n\nAs a non-reductive claim, it means that the phenomenal content of an\nexperience is its intrinsic subjective phenomenal properties, which\nare themselves representational. One\u2019s experience of the sky\nrepresents its color by instantiating phenomenal blueness. Among\nphenomenalists there is disagreement over whether non-conceptual\nrepresentation requires complex structuring of phenomenal properties\n(Block and Peacocke, op. cit., Robinson 1994) or not (Loar 2003b).\nSo-called \u201cGanzfeld\u201d experiences, in which, for example,\nthe visual field is completely taken up with a uniform experience of a\nsingle color, are a standard test case: Do Ganzfeld experiences\nrepresent anything? (It may be that doubts about the\nrepresentationality of such experiences are simply a consequence of\nthe fact that (outside of the laboratory) we never encounter things\nthat would produce them. Supposing we routinely did (and especially if\nwe had names for them), it seems unlikely such skepticism would\narise.)\n\nMost (reductive) representationalists are motivated by the conviction\nthat one or another naturalistic explanation of intentionality (see\nthe next section) is, in broad outline, correct, and by the desire to\ncomplete the naturalization of the mental by applying such theories to\nthe problem of phenomenality. (Needless to say, many phenomenalists\nare just as eager to naturalize the phenomenal \u2013 though not in\nthe same way.)\n\nThe main argument for representationalism appeals to the\ntransparency of experience (cf. Tye 2000: 45\u201351). The\nproperties that characterize what it\u2019s like to have a sensory\nexperience are presented in experience as properties of objects\nperceived: in attempting to attend to an experience, one seems to\n\u201csee through it\u201d to the objects and properties it is\nexperiences\n of.[2]\n They are not presented as properties of the experience itself. If\nnonetheless they were properties of the experience,\nperception would be massively deceptive. But perception is not\nmassively deceptive. In veridical perception, these properties are\nlocally instantiated; in illusion and hallucination, they are not. On\nthis view, introspection is indirect perception: one comes to know\nwhat phenomenal features one\u2019s experience has by coming to know\nwhat objective features it represents. (Cf. also Dretske 1996,\n1999.)\n\nIn order to account for the intuitive differences between conceptual\nand sensory representations, representationalists appeal to structural\nor functional properties. Dretske (1995), for example, distinguishes\nexperiences and thoughts on the basis of the origin and nature of\ntheir functions: an experience of a property P is a state of\na system whose evolved function is to indicate the presence\nof P in the environment; a thought representing the property\nP, on the other hand, is a state of a system whose\nassigned (learned) function is to calibrate the output of the\nexperiential system. Rey (1991) takes both thoughts and experiences to\nbe relations to sentences in the language of thought, and\ndistinguishes them on the basis of (the functional roles of) such\nsentences\u2019 constituent predicates. Lycan (1987, 1996)\ndistinguishes them in terms of their functional-computational\nprofiles. Tye (2000) distinguishes them in terms of their functional\nroles and the intrinsic structure of their vehicles: thoughts are\nrepresentations in a language-like medium, whereas experiences are\nimage-like representations consisting of \u201csymbol-filled\narrays.\u201d (Cf. the account of mental images in Tye 1991.)\n\nPhenomenalists tend to make use of the same sorts of features\n(function, intrinsic structure) in explaining some of the intuitive\ndifferences between thoughts and experiences; but they do not suppose\nthat such features exhaust the differences between phenomenal and\nnon-phenomenal representations. For the phenomenalist, it is the\nphenomenal properties of experiences \u2013 qualia themselves \u2013\nthat constitute the fundamental difference between experience and\nthought. Peacocke (1992), for example, develops the notion of a\nperceptual \u201cscenario\u201d (an assignment of phenomenal\nproperties to coordinates of a three-dimensional egocentric space),\nwhose content is \u201ccorrect\u201d (a semantic property) if in the\ncorresponding \u201cscene\u201d (the portion of the external world\nrepresented by the scenario) properties are distributed as their\nphenomenal analogues are in the scenario.\n\nAnother sort of representation appealed to by some phenomenalists\n(e.g., Chalmers (2003), Block (2003)) is what Chalmers calls a\n\u201cpure phenomenal concept.\u201d A phenomenal concept in general\nis a concept whose denotation is a phenomenal property, and it may be\ndiscursive (\u2018the color of ripe bananas\u2019), demonstrative\n(\u2018this color\u2019; Loar 1990/96)), or even more\ndirect. On Chalmers\u2019s view, a pure phenomenal concept\nis (something like) a conceptual/phenomenal hybrid consisting of a\nphenomenological \u201csample\u201d (an image or an occurrent\nsensation) integrated with (or functioning as) a conceptual component\n(see also Balog 1999 and Papineau 2002). Phenomenal concepts are\npostulated to account for the apparent fact (among others) that, as\nMcGinn (1991b) puts it, \u201cyou cannot form [introspective]\nconcepts of conscious properties unless you yourself instantiate those\nproperties.\u201d One cannot have a phenomenal concept of a\nphenomenal property P, and, hence, phenomenal\nbeliefs about P, without having experience of\nP, because P itself is (in some way)\nconstitutive of the concept of P. (Cf. Jackson 1982,\n1986 and Nagel 1974.) (The so-called \u201c phenomenal concept\nstrategy\u201d puts pure phenomenal concepts to use in defending the\nKnowledge Argument against physicalism. See Loar 1990/96, Chalmers\n2004a. Alter and Walter 2007 is an excellent collection of essays on\nphenomenal concepts. See Conee 1994 and Pitt 2019 for skeptical\nresponses to this strategy.)\n",
