    "main_text": "Idealist Religion and History\n5. Idealist Religion and History\n\nGreen had profoundly moralized conceptions of religion and history.\nBoth conceptions were influenced by his idealist metaphysics and\nethics.\n\nGreen was a deeply religious person, but his conception of\nChristianity was unorthodox and animated by moral and humanistic\nprinciples. He was raised in the Evangelical faith by his father, an\nEvangelical minister. At Balliol, his religious sensibility was shaped\nin part by Jowett, who sought to present fundamental Christian\nprinciples in a contemporary and rational idiom, free of superstition,\nritual, and dogma. Jowett\u2019s example shaped Green\u2019s\ndeveloping conception of a form of Christianity that admits of\nrational philosophical reconstruction, that denies the literal\nsignificance to miracles or other supernatural events described in the\nBible, and that finds Christianity\u2019s best expression in social\nand political service in pursuit of a common\n good.[9]\n\nGreen\u2019s own conception of God is ambivalent. On the one hand, he\nidentifies the eternal self-consciousness of absolute idealism with\nGod. Green thinks that self-conscious minds are conditions of\nconscious experience and not themselves part of conscious experience,\nwith the result that they are outside of space and time. What is true\nof individual minds is true of the corporate mind that Green thinks\nmakes objectivity possible. This would make God a transcendent\nreality. On the other hand, Green has strong reason to regard God as\nimmanent in the world. Self-consciousness expresses itself in the\nwill, which is the cause of action. If so, self-consciousness cannot\nbe outside of space and time. Moreover, Green saw God as immanent in\nindividuals and in history. The higher principle of practical reason\nwithin each person that regulates his desires and makes him a moral\nagent is a divine principle, the common good is the proper object of\nthe divine principle in humanity, and its progressive realization in\nhuman laws and institutions is how God manifests himself to the world\n(Works III 223\u201327). One cannot separate Green\u2019s\nunorthodox form of Christianity from his idealist philosophy and his\nethical demand that individuals subordinate their lower selves to the\npursuit of a higher, common good.\n\nAs we have seen, Green treats perfection, freedom, and the common good\nas regulative ideals at which we aim, which humanity better\napproximates over time. This is illustrated in the gradual expansion\nof the scope of the common good to include persons previously excluded\nfrom full moral personality, such as slaves, women, and workers\n(PE Book III, esp. \u00a7\u00a7205\u2013206, 271, 285). It\nis also illustrated in our progressively more adequate conception of\nthe conditions of self-realization and the demands on government to\npromote the perfection of its citizens. Like Hegel, Green has a\nprogressive view of history, which he sees as the progressively more\nadequate realization of the demands of perfection, the common good,\nand true freedom (PE \u00a7\u00a7172\u201376;\n\u201cFreedom,\u201d Works II 330; LPPO\n\u00a76).\n",
