    "main_text": "Reconstructing an old document\n8. Conclusion\n\nFinally, it should be pointed out that doxographic works are tools of\na sort. They constitute a type of secondary literature of a fluid and\nunstable character, both as to form and as to contents. Shorter and\nlonger versions may be available alongside each other; in fact, for\nall the losses sustained by ancient literature, some still are.\nMaterials may be added, or lost, or added again in a continuous\nprocess of epitomizing and enlarging and updating\u2014and it\nremained possible, of course, to inspect and excerpt original sources\nat least in some cases. \n\nIn order the better to understand the value of the available evidence\npertaining to lost philosophical works from Antiquity one therefore\nshould attempt to understand the traditions and transmissions that are\ninvolved as a whole. One should take the rationale of the extant\noverviews into account, and try to discover the intentions of authors\nwho made use of doxographies. A na\u00efve use of the available\ncollections of philosophical fragments, implying the putting on the\nsame level of reliability of most of the evidence that remains, does\nnot always produce good results.\n",
