    "main_text": "Problems, Objections and Response Strategies || The Wishful Thinking Objection, Moral Reasoning, and Moral Uncertainty\n4.2 The Wishful Thinking Objection, Moral Reasoning, and Moral Uncertainty\n\nA well-known objection to non-cognitivism pays close attention to the\ndistinction between explaining logical relations on the one hand, and\nexplaining the use of moral judgments in reasoning on the other. Even\nif the embedding problem is solved, so that we know what moral\nutterances mean and what complex sentences embedding them also mean,\nwe might still think it irrational to reason in accordance with\nordinary logical principles applied to such judgments. The basic idea\nhere is that conditionals with moral antecedents and nonmoral\nconsequents should, together with the moral judgment in the\nantecedent, license acceptance of the consequent. Thus someone who\naccepts such conditionals would be rational to infer the consequent\nupon coming to accept the antecedent. But if expressivism is correct,\naccepting the antecedent just is holding a non-cognitive attitude.\nThus the licensed inference is really a form of wishful thinking, for\na non-cognitive change of attitude has licensed a change of belief.\nFor example, suppose someone accepts a judgment expressible by saying,\n\u201cIf doing an action is wrong, George will do it.\u201d Normally\nwe think that it would be rational for that person to infer the belief\nthat George will hit Sam upon coming to accept that hitting Sam is\nwrong. But according to non-cognitivism, coming to accept that hitting\nSam is wrong is just a change of non-cognitive attitude, and it can\nseem wrong to think that a change in such attitudes can rationalize a\nchange in belief. It looks like the non-cognitivist is committed to\napproving of something analogous to wishful thinking. That is they\nbelieve something, not because of a change in their evidence but\nbecause of a change in attitude alone (Dorr 2002). Enoch (2003)\npresents an early response which is criticized in (Schroeder 2011,\nchapter 9). See also (Budolfson 2011; Lenman 2003; Mabrito 2013;) who\ngenerally support the idea that solving the Frege-Geach problem will\nbe sufficient for handling Dorr\u2019s wishful thinking objection.\nBut van Roojen (2019) argues that Dorr is right to want something\nbeyond a solution to Frege-Geach. Logic can rule out certain\ncombinations of belief, but does not on its own tell us which member\nof a bad combination to get rid of. But the difference between good\nand bad reasoning may depend on which is retained, and this in turn\ndepends on one\u2019s evidence. Dorr\u2019s argument might then\nsuggest that noncognitivists need to explain how the relevant\nnoncognitive attitudes can relate badly or well to such evidence. And\nthis may contravene Humean arguments for noncognitivism.\n\nAnother issue to do with moral reasoning has to do with uncertainty,\ninsofar as we can be uncertain of our moral judgements and this will\naffect how we reason with them. Michael Smith (2002) argues that\nnon-cognitivists have insufficient resources to distinguish variations\nin moral certainty from differences in both the perceived importance\nof what is being judged right or wrong and in the stability of such\njudgements under the influence of new information. The gradable\ndimensions of desire seem to be strength and stability. If strength is\nused to represent importance and stability to capture stability of\njudgements in the face of new information, desires will lack a\ndimension to represent the certainty with which the moral judgement is\nheld. Cognitivists, by contrast, can allow perceived importance to be\ncaptured by a further belief \u2013 the belief that the matter is of\na certain importance. So they can let certainty just be a matter of\ncredence and robustness in the face of new evidence be just what it\nseems. Non-cognitivists, as usual, won\u2019t just concede the point.\nRather they will explain how their theories have the resources to make\nthe needed distinctions. Lenman (2003c), Sepielli (2012), Eriksson and\nFranc\u00e9n Olinder (2016), and Ridge (2020) are responses in this\nvein. A series of papers and a book by Krister Bykvist and co-authors\n(Bj\u00f6rkholm, Bykvist, & Olson, 2021; Bykvist & Olson 2009,\n2012, 2017; MacAskill, Bykvist & Ord 2020) criticizes each of the\nafformentioned noncognitivist proposals. Finally, Staffel (2019)\noffers an original account of credence for non-cognitivists and\nresponds to Smith\u2019s argument along the way.\n",
