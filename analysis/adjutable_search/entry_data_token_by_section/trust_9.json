    "main_text": "Trust and the Will\n4. Trust and the Will\n\nTrust may not be warranted (i.e., plausible) because the agent has\nlost the ability to trust or simply cannot bring themselves to trust.\nPeople can lose trust in almost everyone or everything as a result of\ntrauma (Herman 1991). The trauma of rape, for example, can profoundly\nreduce one\u2019s sense that the world is a safe place with caring\npeople in it (Brison 2002). By contrast, people can lose trust just in\nparticular people or institutions. They can also have no experience\ntrusting in certain people or institutions, making them reluctant to\ndo so. They or others might want them to become more trusting. But the\nquestion is, how can that happen? How can trust be restored or\ngenerated?\n\nThe process of building trust is often slow and difficult (Uslaner\n1999; Baier 1986; Lahno 2020), and that is true, in part, because of\nthe kind of mental attitude trust is. Many argue that it is not the\nsort of attitude we can simply will ourselves to have. At the same, it\nis possible to cultivate\n trust.[17]\n This section focuses on these issues, including what kind of mental\nattitude trust is (e.g., a belief or an emotion). Also discussed\nbriefly is what kind of mental attitude distrust is. Like trust,\ndistrust is an attitude that people may wish to cultivate,\nparticularly when they are too trusting.\n\nConsider first why one would think that trust can\u2019t be willed.\nBaier questions whether people are able \u201cto trust simply because\nof encouragement to trust\u201d (1986: 244; my emphasis). She\nwrites,\n\n\n\u201cTrust me!\u201d is for most of us an invitation which we\ncannot accept at will\u2014either we do already trust the one who\nsays it, in which case it serves at best as reassurance, or it is\nproperly responded to with, \u201cWhy should and how can I, until I\nhave cause to?\u201d. (my emphasis; 1986: 244)\n\n\nBaier is not a voluntarist about trust, just as most people are not\nvoluntarists about belief. In other words, she thinks that we\ncan\u2019t simply decide to trust for purely motivational rather than\nepistemic reasons (i.e., merely because we want to, rather than\nbecause we have reason to think that the other person is or could be\ntrustworthy; Mills 1998). That many people feel compelled to say,\n\u201cI wish I could trust you\u201d, suggests that Baier\u2019s\nview is correct; wishing or wanting is not enough. But Holton\ninterprets Baier\u2019s view differently. According to him,\nBaier\u2019s point is that we can never decide to trust, not that we\ncan never decide to trust for motivational purposes (1994). This\ninterpretation ignores, however, the attention that Baier gives to\nsituations in which all we have is encouragement (trusting\n\u201csimply because of encouragement\u201d). The\n\u201ccause\u201d she refers to (\u201cWhy should and how can I,\nuntil I have cause to [trust]?\u201d; 1986: 244) is an epistemic\ncause. Once we have one of those, we can presumably decide whether to\ntrust on the basis of\n it.[18]\n But we cannot decide to trust simply because we want to, according to\nBaier.\n\nIf trust resembles belief in being non-voluntary, then perhaps trust\nitself is a belief. Is that right? Many philosophers claim that it is\n(e.g., Hieronymi 2008; McMyler 2011; Keren 2014), while others\ndisagree (e.g., Jones 1996; Faulkner 2007; D\u2019Cruz 2019). The\nformer contend that trust is a belief that the trustee is trustworthy,\nat least in the thin sense that the trustee will do what he is trusted\nto do (Keren 2020). Various reasons exist in favour of such theories,\ndoxastic reasons (see Keren 2020) including that these theories\nsuggest it is impossible to trust a person while holding the belief\nthat this person is not trustworthy, even in the thin sense. Most of\nus accept this impossibility and would want any theory of trust to\nexplain it. A doxastic account does so by saying that we can\u2019t\nbelieve a contradiction (not knowingly anyway; Keren 2020: 113).\n\nThose who say that trust is not a belief claim that it is possible to\ntrust without believing the trustee is\n trustworthy.[19]\n Holton gives the nice example of trusting a friend to be sincere\nwithout believing that the friend will be sincere (1994: 75).\nArguably, if one already believed that to be the case, then one would\nhave no need to trust the friend. It is also possible to believe that\nsomeone is trustworthy without trusting that person, which suggests\nthat trust couldn\u2019t just be a belief in someone\u2019s\ntrustworthiness (McLeod 2002: 85). I might think that a particular\nperson is trustworthy without trusting them because I have no cause to\ndo so. I might even distrust them despite believing that they are\ntrustworthy (Jones 1996, 2013). As Jones explains, distrust can be\nrecalcitrant in parting \u201ccompany with belief\u201d\n(D\u2019Cruz 2019: 940; citing Jones 2013), a fact which makes\ntrouble for doxastic accounts not just of trust but of distrust too\n(e.g., Krishnamurthy 2015). The latter must explain how distrust could\nbe a belief that someone is untrustworthy that could exist alongside\nthe belief that the person is trustworthy.\n\nAmong the alternatives to doxasticism are theories stating that trust\nis an emotion, a kind of stance (i.e., the participant stance; Holton\n1994), or a disposition (Kappel 2014; cited in Keren 2020). The most\ncommonly held alternative is the first: that trust is an emotion.\nReasons in favour of this view include the fact that trust resembles\nan emotion in having characteristics that are unique to emotions, at\nleast according to an influential account of them (de Sousa 1987;\nCalhoun 1984; Rorty 1980; Lahno 2001, 2020). For example, emotions\nnarrow our perception to \u201cfields of evidence\u201d that lend\nsupport to the emotions themselves (Jones 1996: 11). When we are in\nthe grip of an emotion, we therefore tend to see facts that affirm its\nexistence and ignore those that negate it. To illustrate, if I am\nreally angry at my mother, then I tend to focus on things that justify\nmy anger while ignoring or refusing to see things that make it\nunjustified. I can only see those other things once my anger subsides.\nSimilarly with trust: if I genuinely trust my mother, my attention\nfalls on those aspects of her that justify my trust and is averted\nfrom evidence that suggests she is untrustworthy (Baker 1987). The\nsame sort of thing happens with distrust, according to Jones (Jones\n2019). She refers to this phenomenon as \u201caffective\nlooping\u201d, which, in her words, occurs when \u201ca prior\nemotional state provides grounds for its own continuance\u201d (2019:\n956). She also insists that only affective-attitude accounts of trust\nand distrust can adequately explain it (2019).\n\nThere may be a kind of doxastic theory, however, that can account for\nthe affective looping of trust, if not of distrust. Arnon Keren, whose\nwork focuses specifically on trust, defends what he calls an\n\u201cimpurely doxastic\u201d theory. He describes trust as\nbelieving in someone\u2019s trustworthiness and responding\nto reasons (\u201cpreemptive\u201d ones) against taking precautions\nthat this person will not be trustworthy (Keren 2020, 2014). Reasons\nfor trust are themselves reasons of this sort, according to Keren;\nthey oppose actions like those of carefully monitoring the behavior of\nthe trustee or weighing the available evidence that this person is\ntrustworthy. The trustor\u2019s response to these preemptive reasons\nwould explain why this person is resistant (or at least not attune) to\ncounter evidence to their trust (Keren 2014, 2020).\n\nDeciding in favour of an affective-attitude theory or a purely or\nimpurely doxastic one is important for understanding features of trust\nlike affective looping. Yet it may have little bearing on whether or\nhow trust can be cultivated. For, regardless of whether trust is a\nbelief or an emotion, presumably we can cultivate it by purposefully\nplacing ourselves in a position that allows us to focus on evidence of\npeople\u2019s trustworthiness. The goal here could be\nself-improvement: that is, becoming more trusting, in a good way so\nthat we can reap the benefits of justified trust. Alternatively, we\nmight be striving for the improvement of others: making them more\ntrustworthy by trusting them therapeutically. Alternatively still, we\ncould be engaging in \u201ccorrective trust\u201d. (See the above\ndiscussions of therapeutic and corrective trust.)\n\nThis section has centered on how to develop trust and how to account\nfor facts about it such as the blinkered vision of the trustor.\nSimilar facts about distrust were also mentioned: those that concern\nwhat kind of mental attitude it is. Theorizing about whether trust and\ndistrust are beliefs, emotions or something else allows us to\nappreciate why they have certain features and also how to build these\nattitudes. The process for building them, which may be similar\nregardless of whether they are beliefs or emotions, will be relevant\nto people who don\u2019t trust enough or who trust too much.\n",
