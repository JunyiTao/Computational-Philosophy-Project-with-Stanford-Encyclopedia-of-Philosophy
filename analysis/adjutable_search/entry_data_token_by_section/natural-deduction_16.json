    "main_text": "IntElim and some Possible Philosophical Consequences || IntElim as the Correct View of Logic\n7.2 Logic\u2019s Relations with Language and Metaphysics\n\nThe general picture of harmonious Int-Elim rules has not only fuelled\na theory of The One True Logic (as in Read 2006) but also has been the\nbacking for a theory of \u201csemantics\u201d (both of formal logic\nand also of natural language usage) called Inferentialism. As Read\n(2010: 558) puts it,\n\n\nTraditionally, semantics has been denotational and representational,\nconsisting in a homomorphic valuation from expressions to some range\nof objects. This approach risks ontological explosion, first in\nhypostatizing denotations for empty names, predicates, conjunctions,\nprepositions and so on\u2026, then in seeking values for false\npropositions in the form of non actual states of affairs. It is also\nregressive, since a criterion is now needed to determine which\nnon-actual states of affairs are possible, which simply repeats the\ninitial problem. Talk of possible worlds is an attractive metaphor,\nbut does little useful philosophical work and much harm.\n\nInferentialism, in contrast, is ontologically neutral. Expressions are\nmeaningful if there are rules governing their use, in particular,\nlogical expressions are given meaning by the introduction-rules,\nspecifying the grounds for assertion of propositions containing them,\nand elimination-rules drawing inferences from those assertions.\n\n\nThe works mentioned above concerned themselves with introducing\nconnectives in logic, as is appropriate for an entry \u201cNatural\nDeduction in Logic\u201d. But as Read (2010) points out, the general\nviewpoint is consonant with \u201cuse theories of meaning\u201d that\nhave been prominent in philosophy of\n language.[25]\n The chain of inference here seems to be (something like):\n\nSystems of formal logic are best characterized by their natural\ndeduction formalizations.\nThe best sort of natural deduction formalism is by means of a set\nof Int-Elim rules, ones that will lead us to normalizability of proofs\nand will show a harmony in their formalizations.\nGiven the way that such Int-Elim rules operate in formal\nderivations, they should be organized into harmonious pairs. And it is\nclear that this specifies the entirety of the meaning of such\nconnectives.\nNot only is this true of a connective\u2019s meaning within\nlogical systems, but\u2014more widely\u2014it is true of the\nmeanings natural language terms that correspond to such logical\noperators: their meanings are also entirely given by these Int-Elim\nrules.\nHence, it is therefore plausible to suppose that a feature related\nto introduction and elimination should be the entire meaning of\nany (and all) natural language meaning.\n\n\nThis argument from logic to natural language meaning is reminiscent of\nslippery slope reasoning: it might be challenged at any of the sliding\npoints. For instance, one might argue that there is no real reason (=\nno reason other than to try to establish the overall conclusion about\nnatural language meaning) to prefer natural deduction formulations of\nlogic over Frege-Hilbert axiomatic ones. Or one might point to an\nalleged \u201cvast gulf\u201d between logical systems (and the\nreasoning employed in them) and natural language (and the variety of\nuses to which natural language lends itself). Still, the project has\nseemed not just possible but a straightforwardly correct path to\ninvestigate.\n\nSome work in the informal side of this idea is illustrated by Brandom\n(1994, 2000), under the title \u2018Inferentialism\u2019; and on the\nmore formal side by Francez (2015, 2021), under the title\n\u2018Proof-theoretic Semantics\u2019. Arguing both for the formal\nside and for the informal side of this viewpoint is Dummett (1973,\n1977, 1978, 1991), which has been much of the inspiration for the\ncurrent interest in the notion of harmony of inference rules in\nlogical systems as well as in natural language.\n\n\nDummett (1973: 453): Learning to use a statement of a given form\ninvolves learning two things: The conditions under which one is\njustified in making the statement; and what constitutes acceptance of\nit, i.e., the consequences of accepting it.\n\nBrandom (2000: 63): What corresponds to an introduction rule\nfor a propositional content is the set of sufficient\nconditions for asserting it, and what corresponds to an\nelimination rule is the set of necessary\nconsequences of asserting it, that is, what follows from doing so.\n\n\nFrancez (2021: 55\u20136) puts the aim of Proof-Theoretic Semantics\n(PTS) like this (italics and bold in the original):\n\n\nThe PTS programme as a theory of meaning can be described as follows:\n\u2026 Replace the received approach of taking sentential\nmeanings as truth-conditions \u2026 by taking them\nas canonical derivability conditions \u2026 within\na \u201cdedicated\u201d meaning-conferring natural-deduction\nproof-system in which the derivability conditions are formulated.\n\u2026 The proof system should reflect the \u201cuse\u201d of the\nsentences (their inferential roles) \u2026, and should allow\nrecovering pre-theoretic properties of the meanings of sentences, such\nas entailment and consequence drawing (inference).\n\u2026 Such a system has two kinds of rules: Introduction\nrules [and] Elimination rules.\n\n\nA feature of (logical) intuitionism is a denial of the law of\nbivalence, and its characteristic denial of the truth of formulas such\nas \\((p\\lor\\neg p)\\). The intuitionistic interpretation of theoremhood\nis said to be provability, and it may be that neither \\(p\\)\nnor \\(\\neg p\\) is provable, so hence \\((p\\lor\\neg p)\\) should not be\nprovable. In Dummett\u2019s version, the provability constraint is\nreplaced by warranted assertibility\u2026which in turn is\nbased on having rules for being justified in introducing some piece of\nlanguage into a conversation and rules that justify the exploitation\nof the piece (\u2018exploitation\u2019 being the standard term used\nin discussing natural language corresponding to the\n\u2018elimination\u2019 used when one exploits a logical operator).\nA rallying cry of such theorists might be that\n\n\nThe meaning of any term or phrase or linguistic item whatsoever is\ngiven by, and only by, the set of rules for the introduction of such\nan item into discourses and for exploiting them once they have been\nintroduced.\n\n\nOne can see ties from this rallying cry to other views concerning\nmeaning, such as \u201cDon\u2019t ask for the meaning, ask for the\nuse\u201d, or \u201cThe rules of the language game are what\ndetermine, and wholly describe, what is the meaning of linguistic\nitems\u201d.\n\nMichael Dummett has turned this discussion of \u201cuse\u201d into a\nmetaphysical position. (See especially Dummett 1991; but this builds\non Dummett 1977 [e.g., p. 682], and even Dummett 1973 [e.g., p. 377],\nas well as many of his other works.) The basic idea seems to be this:\nintuitionism as applied to logic urges meaning to be given by rules of\nhow to use the connectives. Classical logic, on the other hand,\nassumes that there is a pre-given notion of reference and designation,\nemploying notions like TRUE and FALSE.\nIt follows, he says, that classical logic\nis going to be committed to a pernicious form of \u201cmeaning\nholism\u201d that makes language learning impossible. (To some it\nseems counterintuitive that Dummett should think that classical logic\nwith a meaning-presupposition of reference and denotation is committed\nto \u201ctotal meaning holism\u201d, when that is a more usual\ncriticism of meaning-as-use theories. But that is indeed his view, as\nelaborated in Dummett (1975 [1978]), and elsewhere.) The doctrine that\nfollows from this is called anti-realism by Dummett, and\nentails that there are no \u201crealistic\u201d facts or items that\nground the correctness of logical operations. There is only the\n\u201clearning of how the community uses the relevant\nterms\u201d.\n\nThis is Dummett\u2019s argument from the Manifestation Criterion:\nthere must be some way for language learners to become able to use\nterms of language (in the first instance, learn the terms expressing\nthe logical notions)\u2014there must be some criterion that is\nmanifest in their (language-learning) experience. Dummett claims this\nis where classical semantic theories fail: there is no way, short of\nan all-embracing meaning holism for them to do so, since there is no\naccess to an independent semantic realm apart from language\nitself.\n\nThe literature on Dummett\u2019s version of anti-realism is huge. An\nearly and incisive critique Dummett\u2019s (and also of some of his\ncritics\u2019) thoughts on the Manifestation Criterion is by Michael\n(1999), who argues that classical logic is not actually committed to a\ntotal meaning holism, but only to an innocuous \u201cmolecular holism\nof meaning\u201d. Interested readers might consult Khlentzos (2021)\nfor a general discussion of realism and varieties of anti-realism and\nin particular its \u00a73 for the particular linguistic aspects that\nare relevant to the current subsection.\n",
