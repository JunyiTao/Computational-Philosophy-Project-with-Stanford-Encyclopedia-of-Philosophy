The \u201cPlatonic\u201d turn (after 1324): the new ontology (and semantics) of the macro-objects\n\nAlthough he defended moderate realism at the beginning of his career,\nBurley turned to an original form of radical, somehow Platonic,\nrealism after 1324. This can be found in the prologue to his final\ncommentary on the Physics, in his final commentary on the\nArs Vetus, and in TdU, where he fully develops and\nexplains his new semantic and ontological view. As noted above, the\nchange was brought about by Ockham\u2019s critique of the traditional\nrealist view. In his Summa Logicae (pars I, chs. 14\u201315,\nand 40\u201341) and Commentary on the Categories (prologue,\nand chs. 7, \u00a71 and 8, \u00a71), the Venerabilis Inceptor\nhad shown that many unacceptable consequences follow from the idea\nthat universals are something existing in re, really\nidentical with their particulars considered as instances of a type\n(e.g., the universal man qua man is identical with Socrates),\nbut different considered as properly universal (e.g., man qua\nuniversal is different from Socrates). That is because whatever is\npredicated of the particulars must be predicated of their universals\ntoo, and so a unique common nature would possess contrary attributes\nsimultaneously via the attributes of different particulars. Also, God\ncould not annihilate Socrates or any other singular substance without\nat the same time destroying the whole category of substance and\ntherefore every created being, since every accident depends on\nsubstance for its existence. For these and other similar reasons,\nOckham concluded that the thesis that universals exist in re\nmust be rejected.\n\nBurley was persuaded that Ockham\u2019s objections are sufficient to show\nthat the traditional realist account of the relation between\nuniversals and particulars is unacceptable, but not that realism as a\nwhole is untenable. Thus, in his later years he developed an ontology\nof macro-objects based on a threefold real distinction\nbetween categorial items or simple objects and state of affairs (his\npropositiones in re), between universals and individuals, and\namong the ten categories.\n\nOn Burley\u2019s later view, macro-objects (i.e., what is signified by a\nproper name or definite description such as Socrates or some\nparticular horse) are basic components of the world. They are\naggregates made up of primary substances together with a host of\nsubstantial and accidental forms, both universal and singular,\nexisting in them and through them. Primary substances and substantial\nand accidental forms are simple objects or categorial items, each\npossessing a unique, well-defined nature. These simple objects belong\nto one of ten main types or categories, each really distinct from the\nothers. Although they are simple, some of these components are in a\nsense composite because they are reducible to something \nelse\u2014for example, primary substance is composed of a particular form and\nmatter (EP, ch. de substantia, fol. 22ra). Primary\nsubstance differs from the other components of a macro-object because\nof its peculiar mode of being as an autonomous and independently\nexisting object\u2014in contrast to the other categorial items,\nwhich necessarily presuppose it for their existence (EP, ch.\nde substantia, fol. 22ra\u2013b). Primary substances are therefore\nsubstrates of existence and predication in relation to everything\nelse. The distinction between substantial and accidental forms derives\nfrom their different relations to primary substances, which\ninstantiate substantial forms (which in turn, qua\ninstantiated, are secondary substances), so that such universal forms\ndisclose the natures of particular substances. By contrast, those\nforms that simply affect primary substances without being actually\njoined to their natures are accidental forms. In Burley\u2019s words, the\nforms in relation to which particular substances are the\nsupposita are substantial forms (or secondary substances),\nwhereas those forms in relation to which particular substances are the\nsubiecta are accidental forms (TdU, pp.\n58\u201359). As a result, the macro-object is not simply a primary\nsubstance but an orderly collection of categorial items, so that\nprimary substance, even though it is the most important element, does\nnot contain the whole being of the macro-object.\n\nThe main feature of this metaphysical conception is Burley\u2019s claim\nthat universals fully exist outside the mind and are really distinct\nfrom the individuals in which they are present and of which they are\npredicated. According to him, if universals are no longer actual\nconstituent parts of their particulars, then the inconsistencies\npointed to by Ockham vanish. Furthermore, from a metaphyisical point\nof view, causes must be proportional to their effects. But the causes\nof a particular thing must be particular, whereas those of a common\nnature must be universal. Therefore, individual substances cannot be\ncomposed of anything except particular forms and matter, whereas\nuniversals are composed of a genus and specific difference as well as\nby any other universal form above the genus. Consequently, the lowest\nspecies is not a constitutive part of the individuals in which it is\npresent and of which it is predicated, but only a form coming together\nwith their essences, making their metaphysical structure known\n(EP, ch. de substantia, fol. 23rb\u2013va). Hence, Burley\nsharply distinguishes between two main kinds of substantial form: one\nsingular (forma perficiens materiam) and the other universal\n(forma declarans quidditatem). The former affects (a\nparticular) matter and, together with it, brings the substantial\ncomposite (or hoc aliquid) into existence. The latter, the\nlowest species, discloses the nature of the particular substance in\nwhich it exists and of which it is predicated, but it is not one of\nits constituent parts. So particular substances are in and of\nthemselves really distinct from their species and from each other.\nEvery individual really differs from its species because the latter is\nnot part of its essence, but a form existing in it, as well as really\ndistinct from other individuals belonging to the same species because\nof its own particular form and matter (EIs, ch. de\nspecie, fol. 10va; EP, chs., de substantia,\nfol. 23va\u2013b; de quantitate, fol. 31rb; see also Tractatus\nde formis, pp. 9\u201310). Secondary substances belong to the\ncategory of substance only insofar as they are predicated of the\nessence of particular substances (in quid) (EP, ch.\nde substantia, fol. 22ra), whereas particular substantial\nforms and particular matter do not properly belong to the category of\nsubstance because they do not fulfill the above conditions for being a\nsubstance (EP, ch. de substantia, fol. 22ra).\nBurley\u2019s exposition here amounts to equating the essence of a thing,\nits forma totius (qua really different from the forma\npartis), and its universal (or secondary) substance (namely, the\nspecies of the thing at issue) with one another. The essence so viewed\nincludes substantial form and matter in equal measure. It is\ninterpreted as the main common, immanent form of a certain set of\nindividuals and represents the unchanging and basic properties of that\nset of things. Although the essence is one and the same item in all\nthe singulars of which it is predicated, it is not one in number, but\none according to the species (una et eadem res secundum\nspeciem). It has some sort of unity and identity other than\nnumerical, specifies Burley. As a consequence, it can be present in\ndifferent places, say in Rome and in Oxford, at the same time, since\nthis is compatible with its other-than-numerical unity. The unity of\nthe essence is a transcendental (and so trans-categorial and merely\nintelligible) and not a numerical (i.e, quantitative) unity.\nTherefore, universal essences cannot be counted with their\nindividuals.\n\nBurley uses the standard 13th-century division of\nuniversals into ante rem, in re, and post\nrem (LsP, ch. de forma, fol. 53rb;\nTdU, passim), but he follows Auriol and the earlier\nOckham in positing another mental universal, distinct from the act of\nunderstanding (the \u2018standard\u2019 post rem conceptual\nuniversal), and existing in the mind only as its object (habens\nesse obiectivum in intellectu\u2014EP, ch. de\npriori, fol. 48vb; TdU, pp. 60\u201366). By introducing\na second mental universal existing obiective in the mind,\nBurley hopes to account for the fact that we can grasp the meaning of\na general noun even though we have not experienced any of its\nsupposits, and thus without properly knowing the universal it directly\nsignifies.\n\nBurley identifies secondary substance with the quale quid and\nprimary substance with the hoc aliquid, but quale\nquid and hoc aliquid are what are signified by general\nand discrete nouns, respectively, of the category (EP, ch.\nde substantia, fols. 25vb\u201326ra). Therefore, he argues that\nsecondary substances are metaphysical entities existing outside our\nminds that are necessary conditions for our language to be meaningful,\nas general names would be meaningless if they did not signify\nsomething that both exists in reality, and have the peculiar feature\nof being common to (i.e., present in) many individual things. Only by\nassociating general names with such objects as their proper\nsignificatum did Burley think we could explain how a general\nname can stand for many things at once and name all of them in the\nsame way. According to him, a general name supposits for and names\n(appellare) a set of individual things only through the\ncommon nature or universal which it directly signifies and which is\npresent in that set of individuals (EP, ch. de\nsubstantia, fol. 26ra). Since common natures connect general\nnames with their extensions by determining the class(es) of the things\nto which they are correctly applied, and since they are what general\nnames stand for when they have simple supposition (see De\npuritate, tr. 1\u00b0, pars 1a, ch. 3, pp. 7\u20139),\nthey are actually the intensions of general names\u2014or rather,\nthe hypostatizations of these intensions, seeing that they are\nindependent entities existing outside our minds. On the other hand,\nfrom a merely ontological point of view, universals and particulars\nare connected by the relation of instantiation, so that primary\nsubstances are tokens of secondary substances, since each particular\ninstantiates its associated universal and is recognizable as a token\nof a given type by virtue of its conformity to it and its likeness to\nother particular substances (EP, ch. de substantia,\nfol. 26ra\u2013b). Therefore, in Burley\u2019s system, common natures (i.e.,\nuniversals) and particulars (or simple objects) are related both as\nintensions to extensions and as types to tokens. A certain type or\nuniversal is nothing but the intension of a general name when it is\nconsidered in relation to the extension itself, and conversely, the\nextension of a general name (i.e., a class of individuals) is nothing\nbut the set of tokens of a given type considered in relation to the\nsimple expressions that name them. Thus, the relation holding between\nthe intension and extension of a term is the same as between types and\ntokens. It is a sort of categorization, which can be described in\nterms of the elaboration and acquisition of patterns of\nidentification. Moreover, since Burley now admits two kinds of mental\nuniversals, the first of which is an act of understanding and the\nsecond of which is the object of the former (i.e., its semantic\ncontent apprehended by the mind), the intension and the extension of a\ngeneral term (i.e., the universal nature and the individuals which\ninstantiate it), considered together, are the significatum of\nthe general term, while the concept habens esse obiectivum in\nintellectu provides its sense, or cognitive meaning. Therefore,\naccording to Burley\u2019s final view, the sense/significatum\ndichotomy is not equivalent to the intension/extension dichotomy, the\nlatter being a sub-division of the former. This result makes his\ntheory of meaning very similar to the one developed recently by R.\nCann (Formal Semantics, Cambridge 1993; see especially pp.\n10\u201312; 215\u2013224; and 263\u201369).\n\nAn analogous schema holds for complex expressions, since Burley adds a\nfifth kind of proposition to the ones he recognized before,\ncorrelating them in a similar way, since he now admits spoken,\nwritten, two kinds of mental, and real propositions.\n\nAs we saw above, the distinction between simple and complex objects,\nor (roughly) between objects and states of affairs, is fundamental to\nBurley\u2019s ontology. This distinction is the objective counterpart of\nthe linguistic distinction between simple and compound expressions\n(i.e., nouns vs. sentences or propositions). Thus, Burley can view\nstates of affairs as propositions existing in re. In the\nprologue to his final commentary on the Categories, he claims\nthat a mental proposition is what is signified by a spoken (or\nwritten) sentence. The mental proposition in turn signifies something\nelse, because it is composed of concepts, which are themselves signs.\nAs a result, the ultimate significatum of this chain must be\nsomething that is signified but does not signify, and which has the\nsame logical structure as the mental proposition\u2014i.e., it must\nbe a proposition in re (fols. 17vb\u201318ra; see also ch. de\npriori, fol. 47va). Such a real proposition is an ens\ncopulatum formed by the entity for which the subject and the\npredicate stand together with an identity-relation, if the proposition\nis affirmative, or a non-identity relation, if the proposition is\nnegative (EP, prooem., fol. 18va; EPh,\nprol., fol. 66ra\u2013b). These complex objects differ from\naggregates (the significata of concrete accidental terms),\nwhich are also made up of items belonging to different categories\nsince mere aggregates do not include the identity (or non-identity)\nrelation, and, like simple objects, cannot be true nor false\n(EP, ch. de oppositione, fol. 45va). In the chapter\nde priori, he maintains that there are four kinds of\nproposition, written, spoken, mental, and real, and specifies that the\nmental proposition is twofold: the first, existing in the mind as in a\nsubject (habens esse subiectivum in intellectu), is composed\nof acts of understanding; the second, existing in the mind as the\nobject of the preceding complex act of understanding (habens esse\nobiectivum in intellectu), is what we grasp by means of the mind\nand compare with reality to determine the truth or falsity of a\nproposition. This is the semantic link between the written, spoken,\nand (first) mental propositions on the one hand, and the real\nproposition (the state of affairs) they signify on the other. It\nexists even if the written, spoken, and (first) mental propositions\nare false and nothing corresponds to them in reality (fol. 48vb).\nAccordingly, the proposition habens esse obiectivum in\nintellectu is now the sense of a sentence, and not its extension.\nOn the other side, the new real proposition is the\nsignificatum of the sentence and its truth-maker, since those\nsentences that signify a complex object existing in reality are true,\nwhereas those sentences that do not signify such a complex object, but\nto which only the two (simple) objects designated by the subject and\npredicate correspond in reality, are false.\n\nThe problems connected with his first theory of the semantics of\npropositions are thereby solved. The real proposition of his first\ntheory is split into the mental proposition habens esse obiectivum\nin intellectu and the (new) proposition in re, both of\nwhich have a well-defined semantic and ontological status. In\naddition, false propositions have meaning (i.e., the mental\nproposition habens esse obiectivum in intellectu), but no\nreference, as no real proposition matches them. However, a new\nquestion could arise: if universals and singulars, and the ten\ncategories, are really distinct, how can Burley maintain that there\nmust be an identity relation holding between the things signified by\nthe subject and predicate of every true affirmative sentence?\n\nBurley\u2019s solution is the same as in his first version of the theory:\nin a true, affirmative statement, the significata of the\nsubject and predicate are different, but the things for which they\nstand in personal supposition (i.e., the individual substance or\nsubstances) are the same (EP, prooem., fol. 18va;\nch. de relatione, fol. 37ra; EPh, prol.,\nfol. 66ra\u2013b). This obviously implies that an affirmative proposition\nis true if and only if its extremes have personal supposition for the\nsame thing or things. For example, \u2018Sortes est\nhomo\u2019 (\u2018Socrates is a man\u2019) is true if and only\nif \u2018homo\u2019 in this context has personal\nsupposition for Socrates, that is, if the abstract form of humanity\n(humanitas) is present in Socrates. In this way, the real\ndistinction between universals and particulars, and among the ten\ncategories, is safe, without affecting his theories of correspondence\nand identity.\n\nComplex objects (or states of affairs\u2014Burley\u2019s\npropositiones in re, the ultimate significatum of a\nwritten, spoken or mental proposition) and what we have called\n\u2018aggregates\u2019 (the significatum of a concrete\naccidental term) are not identical with macro-objects, but definite\naspects of them. An aggregate is nothing but the union of one of the\ncountless accidental forms of a macro-object with its primary\nsubstance, and a complex object is the union of two forms of a\nmacro-object (one of which, i.e., the one designated directly or\nindirectly by the subject-term of the proposition, must be\nsubstantial) with and by means of the primary substance. This\nis trivially true not only for propositions in re, such as\nhominem esse animal (man being an animal) or hominem esse\nalbum (man being white)\u2014where the two connected forms are\nhumanity and animality or whiteness respectively, and where what\nunites them is each particular substance that instantiates both of\nthem in the case of man being animal, and which instantiates\nthe form of humanity and is the substrate of inherence of the\nform of whiteness in the case of man being white\u2014but\nalso for propositions in re, such as Sortem esse\nhominem (Socrates being a man). In this case, the two forms\ninvolved are the forma perficiens materiam of Socrates (i.e.,\nhis soul) and the related but distinct forma declarans\nquidditatem (i.e., the species man). What unites them is Socrates\nhimself, since he has the forma perficiens materiam as an\nessential element and instantiates the forma declarans\nquidditatem.\n",
