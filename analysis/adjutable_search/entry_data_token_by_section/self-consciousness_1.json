    "main_text": "Self-Consciousness in the History of Philosophy || Ancient and Medieval Discussions of Self-Consciousness\n1.1 Ancient and Medieval Discussions of Self-Consciousness\n\nAlthough it is occasionally suggested that a concern with\nself-consciousness is a peculiarly modern phenomenon, originating with\nDescartes (Brinkmann 2005), it is in fact the topic of lively ancient\nand medieval debates, many of which prefigure early modern and\ncontemporary concerns (Sorabji 2006). Aristotle, for example, claims\nthat a person must, while perceiving any thing, also perceive their\nown existence (De Sensu 7.448a), a claim suggestive of the\nview that consciousness entails self-consciousness. Furthermore,\naccording to Aristotle, since the intellect takes on the form of that\nwhich is thought (Kahn 1992), it \u201cis thinkable just as the\nthought-objects are\u201d (De Anima 3.4.430), an assertion\nthat was interpreted by Aristotle\u2019s medieval commentators as the\nview that self-awareness depends on an awareness of extra-mental\nthings (Cory 2014: ch. 1; Owens 1988).\n\nBy contrast, the Platonic tradition, principally through the influence\nof Augustine, writing in the fourth and fifth centuries, is associated\nwith the view that the mind \u201cgains the knowledge of [itself]\nthrough itself\u201d (On the Trinity 9.3; Matthews 1992;\nCary 2000) by being present to itself. Thus, on this view,\nself-awareness requires no awareness of outer things. In a similar\nvein, in the eleventh century, Avicenna argues, by way of his Flying\nMan thought experiment, that a newly created person floating in a\nvoid, with all senses disabled, would nevertheless be self-aware. Thus\nthe self that one cognises cannot be a bodily thing of which one is\naware through the senses (Kaukua & Kukkonen 2007; Black 2008;\nKaukua 2015). On such views, and in contrast to the Aristotelian\npicture, basic self-awareness is neither sensory in nature nor\ndependent on the awareness of other things. This latter claim was\naccepted by Aquinas, writing in the thirteenth century, who can be\nseen as synthesising aspects of the Platonic and Aristotelian\ntraditions (Cory 2014). For not only does Aquinas claim that there is\na form of self-awareness\u2014awareness that one exists\u2014for\nwhich, \u201cthe mere presence of the mind suffices\u201d, there is\nanother form\u2014awareness of one\u2019s essence\u2014that, as\nAristotle had claimed, is dependent on cognising other things and so\nfor which \u201cthe mere presence of the mind does not suffice\u201d\n(Summa 1, 87, 1; Kenny 1993: ch. 10).\n\nThis ancient and medieval debate concerning whether the mere presence\nof the mind is sufficient for self-awareness is related to another\nconcerning whether self-awareness is itself sensory in character or,\nput another way, whether the self is or is not perceptible. Aquinas\nhas sometimes been interpreted as offering a positive answer to this\nquestion, sometimes a negative answer (see Pasnau 2002: ch. 11, and\nCory 2014: ch. 4, for differing views). These issues were also\ndiscussed in various Indian (Hindu, Jain, and Buddhist) debates\n(Albahari 2006; Siderits, Thompson, & Zahavi 2013; Ganeri\n2012a,b), with a variety of perspectives represented. For example, in\nthe writing of the eleventh century Jain writer Prabh\u0101candra,\nthere appears an argument very much like Avicenna\u2019s Flying Man\nargument for the possibility of self-awareness without awareness of\nthe body (Ganeri 2012a: ch. 2), whereas various thinkers of the\nAdvaita Vend\u0101nta school argue that there is no self-awareness\nwithout embodiment (Ram-Prasad 2013). There were, therefore,\nwide-ranging debates in the ancient and medieval period not only about\nthe nature of self-consciousness, but also about its relation to other\naspects of the mind, most notably sensory perception and awareness of\nthe body.\n",
