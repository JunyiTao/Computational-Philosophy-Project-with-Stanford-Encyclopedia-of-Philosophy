Conservativity\n\nIt was observed early on that type \\({\\langle}1,1{\\rangle}\\)\nquantifiers denoted by determiners in natural languages have the\nfollowing property:\n\n(22) Conservativity\n(Conserv):\n\n\n    For all M and all \\(A,B\\subseteq M\\), \\[Q_M(A,B) \\iff  Q_M(A,A\\cap B).\\]\n\n\nThis can be seen from sentence pairs such as the following, where it\nis clear that the second sentence is just an awkward way of expressing\nthe first:\n\n(23)  a.\nMost students smoke.\n\n  b.\n Most students are\nstudents who smoke. \n(24)  a.\nAt least five professors\nwere absent. \n  b.\n At least five\nprofessors were absent professors. \n(25)  a.\nMore than one third of\nthe graduate students are foreigners. \n  b.\nMore than one third of\nthe graduate students are foreign graduate students.\n\n\n\nConserv says that only the part of B\nwhich is common to A matters for the truth of \\(Q_M(A,B)\\).\nThat is, the part \\(B-A\\) in Figure 1 doesn\u2019t matter. This\nappears to hold for all determiner denotations, but it fails for\nperfectly natural logical quantifiers, such as MO and\nI from the list \\eqref{ex-qlist3} above. The reason is that it\nis characteristic of determiner denotations that the restriction\nargument restricts the domain of quantification to that\nargument. \n",
