    "main_text": "Descartes\u2019 Early Mathematical Researches (ca. 1616\u20131629) || Texts and sources\n2.1 Texts and sources\n\nBased on the autobiographical narrative included in Part One of the\nDiscourse on Method (1637), where Descartes describes what he\nlearned when he was \u201cat one of the most famous schools in\nEurope\u201d (AT VI, 5; CSM I, 113), it is generally agreed that\nDescartes\u2019 initial study of mathematics commenced when he was a\nstudent at La Fleche. He reports in the Discourse that, when\nwe he was younger, his mathematical studies included some geometrical\nanalysis and algebra (AT VI, 17; CSM I, 119), and he also mentions\nthat he \u201cdelighted in mathematics, because of the certainty and\nself-evidence of its reasonings\u201d (AT VI, 7; CSM I, 114).\nHowever, no specific texts or mathematical problems are mentioned in\nthe 1637 autobiographical sketch. Thus, we rely on remarks made in\ncorrespondence for the more specific details of Descartes\u2019 study\nof mathematics at La Fleche, and these remarks strongly suggest that\nClavius was a key figure in Descartes\u2019 earliest (perhaps even\ninitial) study of mathematics. For instance, in a letter from March\n1646 written by John Pell to Charles Cavendish, we have good reason to\nbelieve that ca. 1616, while a student at La Fleche, Descartes read\nClavius\u2019s Algebra (1608). Reporting on his meeting with\nDescartes in Amsterdam earlier that same year, Pell writes in\nparticular that \u201c[Descartes] says he had no other instructor for\nAlgebra than ye reading of Clavy Algebra above 30 years ago\u201d\n(cited in Sasaki 2003, 47; cf. AT IV, 729\u2013730 and Sasaki 2003,\n45\u201347 for other relevant portions of that letter). Moreover, in\na 13 November 1629 letter written to Mersenne, Descartes refers to the\nsecond (1589) edition of Clavius\u2019s annotated version of\nEuclid\u2019s Elements, in which, as noted above, Clavius\npresents his pointwise construction of the quadratrix and uses the\ncurve to solve the problem of squaring the circle (AT I, 70\u201371;\nthe portion of the letter that references Clavius is translated in\nSasaki (2003), 47). And following Sasaki (2003), it is reasonable to\nconclude that Descartes was at least aware of Clavius\u2019 textbook\nGeometria practica (1604), which was included as part of the\nmathematics curriculum of La Fleche. (See Sasaki 2003, Chapter Two on\nClavius\u2019 influence on and inclusion in the mathematics\ncurriculum of Jesuit schools in the early 1600s.)\n\nAlthough our evidence of the mathematics that Descartes studied at La\nFleche is sketchy, we are quite certain that Descartes\u2019 entrance\ninto the debates of early modern mathematics began in earnest when he\nmet Isaac Beeckman in Breda, Holland in 1618. Among other things,\nBeeckman and Descartes explored the fruitfulness of applying\nmathematics to natural philosophy and discussed issues pertaining to\nphysico-mathematics. It is in this period that Descartes composed his\nCompendium musicae for Beeckman, a text in which he addresses\nthe application of mathematics to music and also famously discusses\nthe law of free fall. (Compare Koyr\u00e9 1939, 99\u2013128 and\nSchuster 2013, Chapter 3.5 on Descartes\u2019 treatment of free fall\nin this early text. For discussion of Descartes\u2019 pursuit of\ncausal knowledge in his physico-mathematical researches in optics\nduring this period, see Schuster 2013, Chapter 3.6.)\n\nBeyond having a common interest in applied mathematics, Beeckman and\nDescartes also discussed problems of pure mathematics, both in\ngeometry and in algebra, and Descartes\u2019 interest in such\nproblems extended to 1628\u20131629, when he returned to Holland to\nmeet Beeckman after his travels through Germany, France, and Italy.\nOur understanding of what Descartes accomplished in pure mathematics\nduring this eleven year period relies on the following sources:\n\nFive letters written to Beeckman in 1619, which Beeckman\ntranscribed in his Journal. Beeckman\u2019s Journal\nwas recovered in 1905 and published in 4 volumes by DeWaard some 35\nyears later, hereafter Beeckman (1604\u20131634). The excerpts of\nthese letters that are relevant to Descartes\u2019 mathematics are\nincluded in AT X. (For more details on how these letters became\navailable to us, see Sasaki 2003, 95\u201396.)\nThe Cogitationes privatae (Private Reflections),\nwhich dates from ca. 1619\u20131620 and which Leibniz copied in 1676.\nThis text is included in AT X. (For more details on how this text\nbecame available to us, see Bos 2001, 237, Note 17 and Sasaki 2003,\n109.)\nThe Progymnasmata de solidorum elementis, a geometry text\nwhich dates from around 1623 and which Leibniz partially copied in\n1676. It has been translated into English by Pasquale Joseph Federico\n(1982) and into French by Pierre Costabel (1987).\nA specimen of general algebra, which Descartes gave to Beeckman\nafter he returned to Holland in 1628. It was transcribed by Beeckman\nin his Journal under the title Algebra Des Cartes\nspecimen quoddam and can be found in Volume III of Beeckman\n(1604\u20131634).\nSome texts on algebra that were given to Beeckman in early 1629.\nThese were transcribed by Beeckman in his Journal in February\n1629 and can be found in Volume IV of Beeckman (1604\u20131634).\nSeveral letters written to Mersenne in the 1630s in which\nDescartes refers to some of the mathematical researches he completed\nduring the 1618\u20131629 period.\n\n\nA look at some of the problems and proposals found in these\nmathematical works will help situate Descartes in his early modern\nmathematical context and will also help to highlight the results from\nthis period that have an important connection to what is found in the\nopening books of the 1637 La G\u00e9om\u00e9trie. To make\nthese connections clear, the brief narrative below emphasizes the\nproposals Descartes made during the 1618\u20131629 period concerning\n(1) the criteria for geometrical curves and legitimately geometrical\nconstructions, and (2) the relationship between algebra and\ngeometry.\n",
