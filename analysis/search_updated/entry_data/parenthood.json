    "preamble": "\n\nThe ethics of parenthood and procreation apply not only to daily acts\nof decision-making by parents and prospective procreators, but also to\nlaw, public policy, and medicine. Two recent social and technological\nshifts make this topic especially pressing. First, changing family\ndemographics mean that children are increasingly reared in blended\nfamilies, by single parents, or by same-sex partners, prompting\nquestions of who should be considered a child\u2019s parent and what\ngood parenting requires. Second, the development and proliferation of\n\u201cAssisted Reproductive Technology\u201d (ART) raises questions\nconcerning access to the technology, its permissibility, and its use\nto enhance future children or prevent the birth of children with\ncertain conditions. Recent debate in ethics and political philosophy\nhas focused on the following questions:\n\nAre there any procreative rights? If so, what are they? What, if\nanything, limits them? When, if at all, is it morally permissible to\nprocreate? What may procreators permissibly aim at in choosing\ncharacteristics of potential children? What are the moral constraints\non the means of procreation? \nWhat are the grounds of parenthood? In what respects is parenthood a\nbiological or natural relationship, and in what respects a social or\nconventional one? \nWhat are the scope and limits of parental rights and responsibilities?\nWhat must parents provide for their children? How should their\nparental responsibilities weigh against other obligations? What should\nparents be allowed to do, and when may, or must, public agencies\nintervene? What, if anything, does society owe parents? What do\nco-parents owe each other? \n\n\nIn the following entry, we divide these questions into three\nsequential stages: the ethics of procreation (creating a child), to\nwhich we devote two sections, and then becoming parents (acquiring\nparental rights and responsibilities) and being parents (holding and\ndischarging parental rights and responsibilities).\n",

    "main_text": "\n1. Foundations\n\nA parent is someone with weighty rights and responsibilities regarding\na given child. Parents usually have decision-making rights over most\nareas of their child\u2019s life and rights to exclude others from\nmaking such decisions. So long as parents fulfill requirements to\nnourish, educate, and provide healthcare for their children, they may\nmake many decisions over how and what their child eats, dresses,\nplays, studies, and with whom he or she interacts.\n Section 5\n surveys controversies regarding the content of these rights and\nresponsibilities.\n\n\u201cParenthood\u201d has distinct senses: biological, social,\nlegal, and moral. These categories present problems at the margins.\nWhile the idea of a biological parent seems self-evident, modern\nreproductive technology complicates it, as a child can have genetic\nparents (gamete providers, who supply the sperm or egg) and a third,\ngestational, parent. Each of these is a biological parent, by virtue\nof making a biological contribution to producing the child. The recent\ntechnology of mitochondrial replacement therapy, in which the nucleus\nof a fertilized egg is transferred to a second egg for medical\nreasons, introduces further complications, as additional genetic\nmaterial\u2014mitochondrial DNA\u2014is supplied by the donor egg\ncell.\n\nBiological parents are commonly distinguished from social parents, who\nrear the child and are socially perceived as responsible for it.\nAdoptive parents, or parents who rear children created with donated\ngametes and gestated by a third party, are social, but not biological,\nparents. (Biological parents need not be social parents, as biological\nparents give up children for adoption, donate gametes, or work as\ngestational parents.) The category of social parent presents\nborderline cases when a given community does not socially recognize\nthose rearing a child as parents. This might occur with a\nmother\u2019s unmarried partner, two friends rearing children\ntogether, other relatives like grandparents rearing the child, or when\na community participates in child-rearing. Legal and moral criteria\nfor the acquisition of parental rights and responsibilities should\nclearly designate whom society should recognize as having them.\n\nLegal parenthood consists in possessing legal parental rights and\nresponsibilities. Historically, in the US, a pregnant woman\u2019s\nhusband has been presumed to be her child\u2019s legal father:\nmarriage, not biology, underpins the legal relation. This has faced\nlegal challenges from genetic fathers (Rosenman 1995; see Hubin 2003\non fatherhood). Law in different jurisdictions is also increasingly\nrecognizing legal parental rights on the basis of same-sex marriage.\nThe rise of ART has prompted many questions regarding assignment of\nlegal parenthood when there are contending claims\u2014as between a\ncouple who commissioned a contract pregnancy and the contracting\ngestational parent. They have also stretched the understanding of\nparenthood, as when the Ontario Court of Appeal recognized three legal\nparents (A.A. v. B.B., 2007 ONCA 2)\u2014a lesbian couple\nand sperm donor. The wider use of ART and gamete donation, along with\nbroader recognition of same-sex marriage and changing social attitudes\ntowards polyamory, have led some philosophers to argue for rethinking\nthe family to include more than two social and legal parents, on\ngrounds including child welfare, social justice, and environmental\nimpact (see, e.g., Cutas 2011, Shrage 2018, Gheaus 2019, Grill\n2020).\n\nLegal, social, and biological parenthood can be conceptually\ndistinguished; however, parenthood is arguably fundamentally a moral\nrelationship, and its moral grounds and obligations should be\nconsidered in resolving the borderline cases. Moral parenthood is\npossession of moral parental rights and responsibilities. These may\ndiffer in content from legal rights and responsibilities\u2014we\nmight think parents morally ought to do more than they are legally\nrequired to do, for example. The moral grounds for assigning parental\nrights can also differ from their legal assignment. Of course, legal\nassignment of parenthood may trigger moral obligations, due to a\ngeneral moral obligation to obey the law or because the legal parent\nis best-placed to rear the child. But moral theories of parenthood\ngive independent grounds for parental rights, on the basis of which\nparticular legal arrangements may be criticized.\n\nThe interrelation of legal, moral, social, and biological parenthood\ndepends on the particular moral theory of how one becomes a parent.\nFor example, on a genetic account, biology determines moral parental\nstatus, whereas on an intentional account, biology will be less\nmorally salient.\n Section 4\n reviews these theories.\n2. Procreative Autonomy\n\n20th-century international human rights documents\nexplicitly codify the right \u201cto marry and found a family\u201d\n(United Nations 1948, Article 16), and thus some writers argue that\nliberal constitutions implicitly enshrine a right to procreate (Hill\n1991). A right to procreate could be construed negatively or\npositively. As a negative right, it would be a right against coercive\ninterference in decisions regarding procreation. As a positive right,\nit would be an entitlement to assistance in procreation.\n\nThis entry does not consider abortion. Although positions on\nprocreative autonomy are not independent of positions on abortion, the\nextensive philosophical debate about abortion must be dealt with\nindependently. The issue of contraception can be touched on briefly\nhere. While some religious views oppose contraception, this position\nis not widely defended in philosophical ethics. However, philosophical\ndebate has recently emerged over \u201cconscientious\nobjections\u201d by pharmacists. In some jurisdictions, pharmacists\nopposing abortion have a legal right to refuse to dispense emergency\ncontraception, on the (medically controversial) basis that it acts as\nan abortifacient. This right has been defended on the grounds that\npharmacists\u2019 freedom of conscience outweighs the inconvenience\nto women (if they can obtain the drug elsewhere). Others have argued\nthat such refusals constitute serious harms to women, not mere\ninconveniences, and that similar objections would not be permitted in\nnon-procreative cases, such as a vegetarian pharmacist who refused to\ndispense materials tested on animals (LaFollette and LaFollette 2007;\nFenton and Lomasky 2005; McLeod 2010; Kelleher 2010; McLeod 2020).\n2.1 Defenses of a right to procreate\n\nA negative moral right to procreate\u2014also discussed under the\nlabel of \u201creproductive liberty\u201d or \u201cprocreative\nliberty\u201d\u2014may be grounded in autonomy rights to control\none\u2019s body and make certain important decisions for oneself\n(Dworkin 1993). Violations could involve direct physical coercion such\nas rape or forced abortion or sterilization, or coercive interference\nwith decisions regarding sexual activity or contraception. Involuntary\nphysical interventions such as forced contraception, sterilization, or\nabortion were practiced in twentieth-century eugenic movements. Their\nwrongness is now generally acknowledged, but critics see continuity\nbetween such racist policies and contemporary moderately coercive\npolicies such as making contraceptive implants the condition of\nmedical aid for impoverished women, particularly for women of color\n(see Roberts 1997).\n\nA right to procreate may also be grounded in the strong interest\npeople have in creating a child, giving birth, and parenting\n(Robertson 1994). Because this justification does not concern a right\nto use one\u2019s body, but to realize the important interest in\ncreating and rearing a child, it can be taken to imply a positive (as\nwell as a negative) right to procreate. Such a positive right could\nalso entail a claim to sufficient environmental resources to raise\nchildren justly (Gheaus 2016a; Roberts 2015) or to funding for ART\n(Robertson 1994). Given that a distinct right to parent could be met\nthrough adoption, some suggest that financial barriers to ART where\nchildren are available for adoption would be justified (De Wispelaere\nand Weinstock 2014). Others have criticized the way that focusing on a\nright to procreate perpetuates the \u201cbiogenetic bias\u201d that\nfavors genetic ties over social ones (Boucai 2016) or challenged the\nidea that the value of establishing a parenting relationship can\nground a right to create someone with the special vulnerabilities of\nchildren to their parents (Hannan and Leland 2018).\n\nLiberal theory has tended to support some sort of right to procreative\nautonomy. At its strongest, the \u201crepro-libertarian\u201d\napproach opposes regulations on reproductive decisions and ART unless\nthey can be shown to threaten harm to others. Repro-libertarianism is\ngrounded in the values of individual equality and autonomy (Feinberg\n1986; Dworkin 1993). The basic thought is that interfering in\nprocreation involves illiberal interference with the person and her\nchoices. Further, some authors hold that ART ought to be universally\navailable provided it does not harm others, because any restrictions\nwould constitute unequal treatment of those who cannot conceive\nthrough sexual intercourse (whether due to infertility or because they\ndo not form a \u201ctraditional\u201d family) (Harris 1998).\n\nRepro-libertarians have been concerned to show that assumptions about\nthe inherent wrongness or harmfulness of ART are not justified. In\nparticular, they have argued that conservative opposition to cloning,\ngenetic selection, surrogacy, and harvesting fetal ovarian tissue is\nbased in undefended traditionalism (Harris 1998; cf. Glover 1998;\nBuchanan et al. 2000, chap. 2).\n2.2 Conservative perspectives on procreative autonomy\n\nCommunitarian conservative approaches to procreative liberty\ntend to regard procreation as part of a dense web of practices that\ngain their meaning and value from being part of a comprehensive way of\nlife. Efforts to increase procreative autonomy\u2014particularly\nthrough biotechnology\u2014risk meddling with such ways of life\n(Sandel 2007). Thus, communitarian conservatives view ART with\nsuspicion. The 20th-century record of Nazi\n\u201ceugenics\u201d programs, forced abortion as a\npopulation-control mechanism, and widespread nonconsensual\nsterilization in many countries, including the United States, is\nadduced as support for pessimism about technological, policy-driven,\nor self-indulgent interventions in procreation (Meilaender 1987).\n\nCommunitarian conservatives typically oppose the use of ART. They also\ncriticize talk of rights in discussion of procreation and parent-child\nrelations. As Murray writes: \u201cProcreative liberty\u2019s\nproblems began when it appropriated the abstract principle\u2014the\nright to choose\u2014and ripped it out of the rich context that\nprovided its moral heft\u201d (Murray 2002, 42).\n\nCommunitarian conservatives need not deny that persons have a strong\ninterest in autonomy regarding procreative decisions. The point is\nthat this interest is both generated and delimited by a particular\ncommunal context. They believe there is no right to reproductive\nautonomy, because reproductive choices gain their meaning and value\nfrom this context.\n\nSome philosophers argue for limiting the moral right to procreate to\nmarried or long-term male-female couples on harm-based grounds (Almond\n2006). Some claim that same-sex and single parenting harm children.\nWhile the empirical debate cannot be addressed here, there seems to be\na lack of evidence that same-sex parenting harms children. For\nexample, an American Sociological Association review finds a\n\u201cclear consensus in the social science literature\u201d that\nchildren of same-sex parents are no worse off than children of\ndifferent-sex parents (see Manning et al., 2014). In any case, since\nevidence suggests that high-conflict families or divorce can harm\nchildren, such arguments risk inconsistency if not applied to\nmale-female couples at risk of divorce or sub-par parenting.\n2.3 Feminist perspectives on procreative autonomy\n\nFeminist perspectives on procreative autonomy are diverse, but they\nshare a commitment to opposing patriarchy and promoting people\u2019s\n(particularly women\u2019s) abilities to determine the shape of their\nown lives, where this includes sexual and reproductive autonomy. While\nsome feminists also take communitarian, repro-libertarian, or more\nnuanced liberal perspectives, other feminists criticize those\napproaches. One general theme of feminist criticism is that mainstream\nprocreative ethics often employs abstractions which obscure the impact\nof policies on women\u2019s bodies, as well as the real-world context\nof socio-economic pressures (e.g., Overall 2012). Much feminist work,\nthen, begins with women\u2019s embodied experience in pregnancy, as\ncaregivers, and as subject to distinct, gendered, social and economic\npressures (e.g., Mullin 2005; Satz 2010; Gheaus 2016b).\n\nThe feminist concern to enable women to control their own lives and\nbodies suggests sympathy with the repro-libertarians\u2019 focus on\nautonomy and equality. But many feminists are skeptical of the\nreproductive biotechnology establishment, which remains preponderantly\nwhite, upper-middle class, male, and corporate. Hence feminists have\ncharged that repro-libertarianism would exacerbate existing power\ninequalities (Corea 1985; Sherwin 1987, 1992; Rothman 1989; Dodds and\nJones 1989a; Baron 2019). While this establishment represents itself\nas empowering women, many feminists charge that it succeeds only in\ndisempowering them: it conscripts poorer women into service for people\nwho are usually wealthier; it creates new expectations that may subtly\ncoerce women to pursue fertility treatments or other medical\ninterventions; and it inevitably reflects the cultural, economic,\nsexist, and racist biases of the society at large (Brazier 1998;\nRoberts 1997).\n\nSome feminists have also raised the concern that any putative right to\nprocreate threatens to give men power over women. In addition to\nempowering the mostly male scientific establishment, a right to\nprocreate could empower a man to prevent his erstwhile partner from\naborting her pregnancy (Overall 1993). Thus the importance of a right\nnot to procreate has led many feminists to place the various strands\nof procreative autonomy within a nexus of interests.\n\nCritiques of the concept of procreative autonomy as misleading or\nempty rhetoric reflect a larger feminist project critical of autonomy\nconstrued as individual choice: within an inegalitarian social and\neconomic system, some feminists argue, pressures on choice will ensure\nthat supposedly free choices disadvantage women (e.g. Dodds and Jones,\n1989a). This is particularly problematic when the medical\nestablishment presents burdensome technologies as the expected norm.\nChoices are shaped by the salient alternatives, so that the widespread\nadoption of new medical technologies will affect women\u2019s choices\n(as the normalization of testing for Downs\u2019 syndrome shapes\nwomen\u2019s choice to undergo such testing). The point is not that\nadopting new technology is always problematic, but that the\nrepro-libertarian framework for evaluating it is na\u00efve and\nmisleading (Sherwin 1992; see also\n 3.5\n below, State Policies). These concerns extend to the way in which\nreproductive policy and technologies shape, and are shaped by, race as\nwell as gender (Roberts 1997; Russell 2018).\n\nA further feminist concern is that the rhetoric surrounding\nreproductive biotechnology commodifies women\u2019s bodies, devalues\nwomen\u2019s role in reproduction, and treats women as mere means\nrather than ends in themselves. For instance, some reproductive\nservices entail so-called \u201cwomb rental,\u201d \u201cegg\nharvesting,\u201d or \u201csurrogate motherhood\u201d (Rothman\n1989; Ber 2000; Anderson 1990; Baron 2019). Feminists such as Corea\nargue that the reproductive biotechnology establishment relies on a\ndistorted and stereotyped picture of the nature, desires, and needs of\nwomen, as well as the success rate of the technologies it purveys, and\nthat these technologies result in physical harms to women (Corea 1985;\nBrazier 1998).\n\nBy conceptualizing women and their fetuses or newborns as having\nconflicting interests, rather than as in symbiotic harmony (as they\nusually are), the medical establishment promotes an adversarial view\nwhich lends itself to overriding pregnant women\u2019s treatment\ndecisions. Such interventions, such as court-ordered C-sections, are\nespecially problematic when similar interventions would not be imposed\non parents to save a born child\u2019s life (such as a court-ordered\nblood transfusion); this inconsistency suggests a bias against\npregnant women\u2019s decision-making capacity. Understandings of\npregnancy and motherhood, feminists argue, need to be enriched by\nconsidering women\u2019s experience of pregnancy and moving away from\nan antagonistic medical model, as well as appreciating how that model\nhas been socially constructed (Purdy 1990; Kukla 2005; Mullin\n2005).\n\nFeminist care ethics, which early on took the mother-child\nrelationship as the model of caring (e.g., Held 1987), has provided a\nrich conceptual resource for feminist procreative ethics. The\ninfluence of care ethics can be seen, for example, in arguments which\nforeground the value of intimate mother-fetus relationships in\nexamining the moral basis of parenthood and the legitimacy of contract\npregnancy (e.g., Gheaus 2016b). In light of the challenge to\ntraditional understandings of parenthood posed by new ARTs, Mary\nLyndon Shanley has argued for caregiving as the ground of moral\nparenthood (Shanley 2018).\n\nFinally, much feminist scholarship has focused on the unequal division\nof labor between parents within the household and its effect on\ngirls\u2019 life chances, and hence on the state\u2019s role in\naddressing this gendered division of parenting labor and defining the\nlegal institution of the family (Okin 1989, Card 1996, Schouten 2019;\nsee also\n 3.5\n below). Feminist perspectives appear throughout the discussion below.\n(See also the entry on\n feminist perspectives on the family.)\n2.4 Anti-natalism\n\nA further set of objections to the unburdened exercise of procreative\nautonomy is anti-natalist. Anti-natalism is opposition to procreation.\nIn its local form anti-natalism applies only to particular people in\ncertain instances. In the case where a child would predictably\nexperience a life so miserable as to be not worth living, it may be\nargued that procreation would be wrongful. Whether there are such\nlives\u2014and if so, what characterizes them\u2014is controversial,\nbut it is not unreasonable to suppose that a life can be so\nirremediably miserable that it is of no benefit to the individual who\nendures it. Arguably, the lives of those born with Tay-Sachs disease\nfit this description, and many argue that it is immoral to knowingly\nbring such children into the world. Some authors go much further than\nthis, arguing that procreating is wrong unless the parent has reason\nto think he or she can provide the child with a good chance of a\nnormal life. The general claim is that certain types of individuals\nhave an interest in not being brought into existence on account of the\nquality of life they would have were they created (McMahon 1998;\nRoberts 1998). ARTs allowing post-menopausal women to give birth have\nprompted objections to post-menopausal motherhood on grounds of child\nwelfare; but such arguments seem to employ double standards (see Cutas\n2007). Cassidy holds that prospective parents who believe they will\nnot be sufficiently competent should not procreate (Cassidy 2006).\nRelatedly, Benatar argues that autonomy rights cannot permit risking\nsevere harm to children; those who risk transmitting HIV, for\ninstance, cannot assert a right to reproduce (Benatar 2010). Local\nanti-natalism is also supported by the judgment that wrongful birth,\nbirth which wrongfully imposes undue risk and harm on a resulting\nchild, is possible (Shiffrin 1999).\n\nGlobal anti-natalism opposes procreation in general. One global\nanti-natalist position holds that in all cases procreation is a harm\nto those brought into being. Benatar argues that while existence\nbrings pains as well as pleasures, non-existence is a lack of pains\nand pleasures. While pain is bad, absence of pain and pleasure is not\nbad, so it is always worse to be than not to be (Benatar 1997, 2006;\nsee also discussion of Shiffrin 1999, below; for responses, see\nOverall 2012, Benatar and Wasserman 2015). Other global anti-natalist\npositions focus on harms or costs to others. An environmentalist\nanti-natalism argues that procreation is wrong for the same reasons\noverconsumption is (Young 2001, MacIver 2015). An opportunity-cost\nanti-natalism argues that the money spent on rearing a child would be\nbetter spent on ameliorating the lives of those already existing\n(Rachels 2014). And a misanthropic anti-natalism argues that humans\ncause so much harm \u2013 to other humans, non-human animals, and the\nenvironment \u2013 that there is a duty not to procreate (Benatar\n2015). Others have argued that the availability of children needing\nhomes creates strong moral reasons to adopt rather than to procreate\n(Friedrich 2013, Rulli 2014). There are also intermediate positions.\nFor example, Sarah Conly argues that the interests that ground a right\nto procreate can be satisfied with only one child and so it may be\npermissible to restrict the number of children an individual creates\nwhen costs to third parties from overpopulation are substantial (Conly\n2005, 2016; see also Statman 2005).\n\nNote that anti-natalists do not always defend legal restrictions,\nbecause interfering with procreation may involve intolerably illiberal\ncoercion of the person. Even those who do think that there are\ncircumstances in which interference with procreation can be justified\naccept that there are important countervailing values. For example,\nBenatar notes that the moral costs of forced abortion or sterilization\nare \u201cimmense,\u201d but thinks that the moral costs of moderate\ncoercion or directive counseling should be weighed against the moral\ncosts of harm to future children (Benatar 2010; see also the\ndiscussion of parental licensing in Section 5.2 below).\n\nOne response to anti-natalist views is to provide a justification for\nthe decision to procreate. Some authors, agreeing that procreation\nrequires a justification and that many common reasons for procreating\ncarry no moral weight, locate a possible justification in the unique\nnature of the parent-child relationship, the desire for pregnancy, or\nthe desire to pass on valuable family traits (Overall 2012, Rulli\n2016, Brake 2015, Ferracioli 2018; on whether one can make a rational\ndecision to have a child, see Paul 2015 and Krishnamurthy 2015).\n3. The Morality of Procreation\n\nFor the most part, secular debates about the morality of procreation\nfocus on whether and when procreation is impermissible, rather than\nwhether it might be obligatory (though see Smilansky 1995 and Gheaus\n2015 on whether there could be a duty to procreate). The debates\nconcerning the impermissibility of procreation raise deep issues in\nmetaphysics and value theory (Belshaw 2003; Holtug 2001; Kavka 1982;\nRachels 1998). We restrict our discussion to moral issues rather than\nlegal ones, and assume throughout that reproduction is fully voluntary\nand informed\u2014that is, neither coerced nor accidental.\n3.1 The Non-Identity Problem and Impersonal Considerations\n\nIt might be hoped that we could give a full account of permissible\nprocreation by appealing only to the interests of the individuals\naffected by procreative decisions. Unfortunately, there is reason to\nthink that this may not be possible. Consider the following sort of\ncase, introduced into the literature by Parfit (1984), and known as\nthe non-identity problem (Hanser 1990; Harman 2004; Woodward 1986;\nentry on\n the nonidentity problem):\n\n\nMarie is taking a drug that she knows will cause a birth\ndefect\u2014say, a withered arm\u2014in any child that she conceives\n(call this child \u201cAmy\u201d). In 3 months this drug will have\npassed from her body, and she will be able to conceive a child free\nfrom this defect (call this child \u201cSophie\u201d). Intuitively,\nMarie does something wrong in deciding to have Amy rather than\nSophie.\n\n\nNon-identity cases of this kind are called \u201csame-number\u201d\ncases because they involve comparing situations that contain the same\nnumber of individuals. Other versions of the non-identity problem\ninvolve different-number (or non-comparative) choices:\n\n\nSri has a genetic condition that she knows will cause any child she\nconceives to be born with a serious cognitive disability. Despite\nknowing this fact, Sri deliberately conceives and gives birth to a\nseriously cognitively disabled child, Aarav.\n\n\nAssume, plausibly, that Amy and Aarav have lives that are worth\nliving. Does Marie do something wrong in conceiving and giving birth\nto Amy? Does Sri do something wrong conceiving and giving birth to\nAarav? Many are inclined to think that they do, but it is unclear how\nwe can capture this wrongness by appeal only to the interests of the\nindividuals involved. This is because wronging someone seems to\npresuppose that things could have gone otherwise for that individual,\nbut things could not have gone otherwise for either Amy or Aarav.\nSri\u2019s putative wrong consists in creating Aarav, and doing\notherwise would have entailed creating no one. Her action has no\nvictim and therefore sets back no one\u2019s interests. Amy\nisn\u2019t made worse off by Marie\u2019s actions, for had Marie\nwaited another three months before conceiving she would have given\nbirth to a different child (Sophie) instead of Amy. It is therefore\ndifficult to see how Marie might have harmed or wronged Amy.\n\nIt is also prima facie implausible that the interests of other parties\nexplain why these actions would be wrong: they are wanted and their\nbirths don\u2019t harm their community.\n\nThe non-identity problem is not solely a problem for the morality of\nprocreation. Anyone who affects the welfare of future people in\nidentity-affecting ways may face it. Readers interested in general\napproaches to the non-identity problem should consult the relevant\nentry. Here we discuss just those aspects bearing on the ethics of\nbecoming parents (see also Hanser 1990; Vehmas 2002).\n\nFeinberg (1992) compares situations like the Marie and Sri cases with\ncases in which someone is harmed in the course of being saved from a\ngreater harm (e.g., his leg is broken while his life is being saved).\nIn both cases an evil or harm is justified in virtue of the fact that\nit is a necessary condition of a greater good\u2014in the one case\nsaving a person\u2019s life, in the other case bringing a life into\nexistence. Shiffrin (1999), however, holds that harming someone to\nsave them from a greater harm is morally distinct from harming them to\nimpose a \u201cpure benefit\u201d on them. Shiffrin claims that we\nhave serious qualms about harming someone without their consent to\nsecure a pure benefit for them, even when we can be sure that they\nwould regard the pure benefit as far outweighing the harm (see also\nSteinbock and McClamrock 1994). She concludes that procreation is\nroutinely more morally problematic than is generally recognized.\n\nShiffrin\u2019s attempt to drive a wedge into Feinberg\u2019s\nanalogy raises questions of its own. First, one might challenge the\nassumption that life is a pure benefit. Even if we assume that\nAmy\u2019s life would be worth living, creating her would be a\nbenefit only on a rather peculiar conception of what a\n\u201cbenefit\u201d entails. Amy is not better off than she\notherwise would have been, for there is no way that she otherwise\nwould have been. Furthermore, the argument may prove too much. If one\nis never justified in harming someone (without their consent) to\nimpose a pure benefit on them, and if existence always involves some\nform of harm, then it must always be wrong to bring someone into\nexistence. A global form of anti-natalism (see\n Section 2.4)\n thereby seems to be the price of this solution to the non-identity\nproblem.\n\nA number of authors, including Parfit, argue that we need to appeal to\nimpersonal considerations to solve the non-identity problem. Several\nof these solutions appeal to the role morality of parents. According\nto Freeman, \u201cThe principle of parental responsibility requires\nthat individuals should desist from having children unless certain\nminimum conditions can be satisfied. Responsible parents want their\nchildren to have good and fulfilling lives\u201d (1997, 180). Freeman\ngoes on to claim that the principle of parental responsibility entails\nthat the very young and very old should not become parents. Similarly,\nPurdy claims that one shouldn\u2019t reproduce unless one can ensure\nthat one\u2019s children will have a decent life, with clean water,\nnutritious food, shelter, education, and medical care counting as\nbasic prerequisites (Purdy 1995). Purdy\u2019s position seems to\nimply that many\u2014even most\u2014of the world\u2019s children\nhave been wrongly brought into existence. More recently, Wasserman has\nargued that whether it is permissible to bring a child into existence\nwith certain characteristics (such as impairments), depends on the\nreasons the prospective parents have for creating such a child. These\nshould be reasons that concern the good of the child, which can still\nsupport creating a child whose life will predictably go worse than\nthat of another child who could be created instead (Wasserman 2005).\nOthers have taken similar reasoning to show that prospective parents\ncan be morally criticized for their attitudes to future children, such\nthat the desire to have a child with a harmful condition is wrongful\n(Kahane 2009).\n\nNot all of those who have written on the non-identity problem accept\nthat Marie does wrong in deciding to have Amy rather than Sophie, or\nthat Sri does wrong in reproducing. Indeed, some find the suggestion\nthat it is wrong to (knowingly) bring disabled children into the world\nabhorrent due to the implications of such views for individuals with\ndisabilities. Asch holds that a woman has a right to an abortion, but\nalso that it would be wrong to have an abortion to prevent the birth\nof a disabled child. Abortion on such grounds is immoral, she argues,\nbecause it communicates that \u201cdisability is so terrible it\nwarrants not being alive\u201d (Asch 1999, 387). The argument could\neasily be extended to decisions about whether to conceive a certain\ntype of child. Does prenatal diagnosis and selective abortion, or\npreimplantation genetic diagnosis, communicate that disability is so\nterrible it warrants not being alive? On its face this claim is\ncontestable; the associated decisions are highly specific to each\ncase. And even if such acts did communicate something, it is unclear\nthat it would be a thesis about relative qualities of life (see also\nBuchanan et al. 2000, chap. 7). For more discussion of the ethics of\ncreating people with disabilities see encyclopedia article on\n disability: health, well-being, and personal relationships.\n3.2 Assisted Reproductive Technologies\n\nSuppose that competent adults have the liberty to procreate. Are there\nlimits on the means that they may take in order to do so? In this and\nthe following section we focus on three methods of ART that have\ngenerated controversy: gamete donation, in vitro fertilization (IVF),\nand commercial surrogacy. (Here we focus on technologies already\nwidely used; for a discussion of reproductive human cloning, see the\nentry on\n cloning.)\n\nMost discussion has centered on whether it is permissible for\nprospective parents to avail themselves of these novel technologies\nfor procreation. There has also been some debate over whether people\nhave a claim to access these technologies through public health care\nsystems or private health insurance. Most rich countries with\nuniversal health care provide some treatment for infertility. For\nexample, the United Kingdom\u2019s National Health Service funds a\nlimited number of cycles of IVF for couples who meet eligibility\ncriteria. Given limited resources, providing ART takes away from money\nthat could be spent on other health care interventions (Roberts 1997).\nIn this context it is particularly important whether infertility is\nproperly considered a disease or disability in need of treatment\n(Neumann 1997; McLeod 2017). Another broad social concern raised by\nall these technologies is their role in the reproduction of race; when\nsuch technologies are used to produce racially similar children, they\nmay perpetuate the idea of race as natural, as opposed to a social\nconstruction (Russell 2018).\n\nGamete donation involves the provision of gametes by a man or woman\nwho is not intended to be the resulting child\u2019s social parent.\nInsemination by another man is not a new technology per se, but the\nmodern phenomena of sperm banking and anonymous providers have led\nsome to question the morality of artificial insemination by donor\n(AID). Some objections clearly have a religious basis; we therefore do\nnot discuss them here. But some conservatives about procreative\nliberty have also developed secular objections to gamete donation. The\nmost interesting of these focuses on the practice of paying gamete\nproviders. For example, Thomas Murray criticizes \u201cinsemination\nby vendor\u201d on the grounds that it inserts the values of the\nmarketplace into family life and thereby threatens to undermine it\n(Murray 1996, 34). The process of harvesting ova also involves serious\nrisks to the woman providing them, which are discussed in the\ndescription of the IVF process below.\n\nA different set of concerns centers on the moral responsibilities of\ngamete providers. Since in most jurisdictions gamete providers must\nwaive all parental claims over their genetic offspring, it has been\nwidely assumed that they do not have moral parental responsibilities.\nSeveral philosophers have, however, argued that gamete donation is\nmorally dubious, precisely because providers take their parental\nresponsibilities too lightly (Benatar 1999; Nelson 1991; Moschella\n2014). The argument can be challenged in at least two ways. First, we\nmight challenge the claim that gamete providers typically treat their\nparental responsibilities too lightly by transferring or alienating\nthem (Bayne 2003, Page 1985), especially in the case when gamete\ndonation occurs in a context in which assisted reproduction is\nregulated and would-be gamete recipients are screened. Second, one\ncould argue that in the broad nexus of persons responsible for\ncreating a child through assisted reproduction, the contribution of\ngamete providers is not especially morally significant (Fuscaldo\n2006). (See the entry on\n gamete donation and sale.)\n However, recent critics have argued that gamete donors morally cannot\ntransfer or alienate their parental responsibilities because these\ninvolve maintaining particular relationships which cannot be\ntransferred (Weinberg 2016; see also Brandt 2017).\n\nA distinct debate concerns the permissibility of procreating using\nanonymous gamete donors. Velleman argues that this practice is wrong\nbecause it frustrates children\u2019s interest in knowing their\ngenetic forebears (Velleman 2005). In response, Haslanger argues that\nnot only does this view make certain forms of adoption morally\nsuspect, it presupposes implausible connections between genetics,\nidentity, and human flourishing (Haslanger 2009). Policy debates over\nanonymous gamete donation have expanded to the question of whether\ndonor-conceived individuals\u2014as adults\u2014have the right to\nknow who their genetic parents are (Melo\u2010Mart\u00edn 2014;\nGroll 2020). Anonymous donation is now illegal in a number of\njurisdictions.\n\nIVF involves fertilizing ova outside the womb and transferring\nresulting embryos into the uterus. The woman whose ova are used is\ngiven a hormone treatment that induces producing multiple ova, which\nare harvested by a needle inserted through the vaginal wall.\nFertilization may involve incubating the ovum in sperm or injecting a\nsingle sperm into the ovum in intracytoplasmic sperm injection (ICSI).\nSeveral embryos are transferred into the uterus after three to five\ndays. Since the birth of the first \u201ctest-tube baby\u201d in\n1978, IVF has become a fairly common procedure for addressing certain\nforms of infertility.\n\nObjections to IVF have focused on negative consequences for the women\nor their offspring and on wider societal implications. Stimulation of\nthe ovaries may lead to ovarian hyperstimulation syndrome, a\npotentially serious condition. Like any surgical procedure there are\nrisks involved in retrieval of ova. Transferring multiple embryos\nincreases risk of multiple pregnancy, which can be risky for both\nmother and fetuses. Fetuses born as a result of IVF may be at an\nincreased risk of birth defects, lower birth weights, and premature\nbirth (Bower and Hansen 2005; Reefhuis et al. 2009). The absolute risk\nof these problems remains relatively low, however, and so they do not\nseem to justify a blanket prohibition on IVF.\n\nSimilar objections to those raised against gamete donation have also\nbeen raised against IVF, including that it commodifies children and\nfemale reproduction. Feminists have developed a more subtle critique.\nSherwin (1987) argues that the powerful desires that many people,\nespecially women, have for their own biological children are the\nproduct of problematic social arrangements and cultural values. While\nreproductive technologies like IVF may help some (privileged) women\nget what they want, they also further entrench the oppressive societal\nvalues that create these powerful desires in the first place.\n\nIVF typically results in creating more embryos than are used in the\nfertility treatment. The remaining embryos may be given to other women\nfor implantation, donated for research, destroyed, or cryogenically\nstored. There are likely over a million cryogenically stored embryos\nin the United States alone (Christianson et al. 2020). Depending on\none\u2019s view of the moral importance of human embryos this may be\nconsidered an especially worrying consequence of IVF. People who\nbelieve that such embryos have the same moral status as humans will\njudge that destroying them is wrong and creating them without a plan\nfor implantation is comparably bad. The use of surplus embryos as a\nsource of totipotent stem cells for medical research has generated\nobjections from religious groups and conservatives opposed to\nabortion. Consistency would seem to require that anyone who objects to\nusing these embryos in research ought also to object to their creation\nin the first place, since it almost inevitably results in surplus\nembryos that will eventually be destroyed.\n3.3 \u201cSurrogacy\u201d and Contractually Assisted Reproduction\n\nPerhaps the most controversial form of assisted reproduction is\nso-called \u201csurrogate\u201d motherhood or contract pregnancy.\nSuch arrangements can take many forms, but the most widely discussed\ninvolves two parties, a contracting couple and a\n\u201csurrogate\u201d or gestational mother. The gestational mother\ncarries a child derived from the gametes of one or both members of the\ncontracting couple and agrees to give the child over to the couple\nafter birth. Surrogacy is now regulated in most countries. Commercial\nsurrogacy is widely, although not universally, illegal, driving an\nincrease in international surrogacy. Many more jurisdictions permit\nso-called \u201caltruistic\u201d surrogacy, which does not involve\npaying the surrogate mother over and above compensating her for direct\ncosts.\n\nMany of the disputes surrounding contract pregnancy focus on the\nquestion of who should be given parental rights and responsibilities\nif the arrangement breaks down. (In some cases, neither party to the\narrangement wants to keep the baby; in other cases both parties want\nto keep it.) Indeed, much of the impetus for recent accounts of the\ngrounds of parenthood has derived from attempts to adjudicate such\ndisputes (Shanley 2018, and see\n section 4).\n\nRepro-libertarians insist that a right to procreative autonomy entails\nprotecting most methods of \u201ccollaborative reproduction,\u201d\nso long as they are safe and consensual (Robertson 1994, chap. 6). For\nthem, the right to procreate is a special case of the right to make\nbinding contracts (see Straehle, 2019). But it is not settled whether\nsuch contracts ought to be legal and, if so, enforceable.\n\nOne central point of contention is whether gestational surrogacy\ninvolves commodification\u2014for example, by entailing that the\ngestational mother is selling her baby\u2014or whether it is no\ndifferent in kind from other forms of paid childcare (Anderson 1990;\nRadin 1996; Glover et al. 1989; Shanley 1993; but see also Arneson\n1992). It is also disputed whether a parental right acquired through\ngestation can be contractually transferred: on a gestationalist view\nwhich grounds the right to parent in the intimate relationship between\ngestator and fetus, the justification of the right entails that it is\nnot subject to transfer (Gheaus 2016b, and see 4.2).\n\nA distinct concern has to do with whether anyone who undertakes a\ncontractual obligation to surrender custody of future children can do\nso autonomously. Some writers argue that such decisions cannot be\nautonomous, and hence that surrogacy contracts should not only be\nunenforceable but also illegal (Dodds and Jones 1989b; see Purdy 1989\nand Oakley 1992 for a response).\n\nContract pregnancy is also criticized on grounds of harm to women. One\nsuch harm is that, in practice, it treats women as, and reinforces the\nperception of them as, mere fetal \u201ccontainers\u201d (Purdy\n1990, Satz 2010, Baron 2019). The fact that it gives medical staff and\nintending parents extensive control over women\u2019s sexuality and\ntheir bodies is particularly troubling in the context of gender\ninequality (Satz 2010). But others reject bans on surrogacy contracts\nas paternalistic, unduly limiting women\u2019s freedom. Nevertheless,\neven those who defend contract pregnancy urge that safeguards, such as\nmandated post-natal waiting periods during which the gestational\nmother is permitted to change her mind or age-based restrictions on\nwho may enter into such contracts, should be in place to protect the\ninterests of the child and of the gestator (Steinbock 1988; Straehle\n2016; see also Botterell and McLeod 2016).\n\nMore recently, the discussion has moved to ethical analyses of\ninternational surrogacy arrangements. These have typically involved\ncommissioning parents from high-income countries and surrogate mothers\nfrom poorer populations in less wealthy countries, including India and\nThailand. The vast power differentials between the parties, expanded\nroles for surrogacy agencies brokering the arrangements, and loose\nregulatory regimes have made for heightened concern about exploitation\nand other potential wrongs (Panitch 2013, and see discussion in Purdy\n1989, Wilkinson 2016).\n3.4 Enhancement\n\nSome couples who undergo IVF also opt for preimplantation genetic\ndiagnosis (PGD) whereby the genomes of their embryos are analyzed and\nparticular embryos then selected for implantation. This is more common\namong couples at risk for transmitting a genetic disease or who are\ntrying to create a child compatible with an existing ill child so that\nshe can be used as a source of donated stem cells. However, it can be\nused for selecting for or against other traits, such as sex, or\ndisability\u2014for example, some deaf parents want to raise children\nwho inherit their deafness. Such uses of PGD are controversial (on sex\nselection see Heyd 2003; Robertson 2003; Purdy 2007; ESHRE Task Force\n2013; on selecting deafness see Karpin 2007; Fahmy 2011; Schroeder\n2018).\n\nCurrent technology is mostly limited to selecting among existing\nembryos. However, the recent development of CRISPR-Cas9 genome editing\ntechniques has finally made it possible to genetically alter gametes\nand embryos in vivo. This has made questions about the permissibility\nof genetic enhancement pressing.\n\nSeveral critics of genetic enhancement argue that permitting\nenhancement is liable to undermine important human values. Sandel\nargues that the control that enhancement technology would allow\nparents is liable to undermine their humility in the face of the gift\nof their children, impose responsibilities that we are not prepared to\ndeal with, and threaten social solidarity (Sandel 2007). Habermas\nargues that parents who genetically enhance their children will,\nthrough the control they exert, prevent their children from entering\nrelationships of moral equality and undermine their ability to be\nautonomous (Habermas 2003). Both have been criticized for exaggerating\nthe likely effects of permitting enhancement technologies (Fenton\n2006; Lev 2011).\n\nA second argument against permitting parents to genetically enhance\ntheir offspring is that it is liable to exacerbate unfairness.\nEnhancements will probably be available only to richer parents. As a\nresult, their offspring, who are already advantaged over their peers,\nwould be even better able to compete against them (Etieyibo 2012).This\nis commonly raised as a particular objection to genetic (or other\nbiomedical) enhancements, but it is not clear why there is something\ndistinctive about genetic enhancement that renders it more troubling\nthan other ways in which parents attempt to enhance their children,\nsuch as private schooling.\n\nThe fairness objection also assumes that the advantages of genetic\nenhancement are competitive advantages, so that an enhancement would\nmake the recipient better able to compete with others for goods such\nas careers and social status. This assumption underlies concerns both\nthat the availability of enhancements would exacerbate existing\ninequalities and that if universally available they would be\ncollectively self-defeating (as, for example, if everyone were to add\n6 inches to their height) (Glannon 2001). However, this assumption\nmight be false; for example, literacy is a non-genetic enhancement\nwhich is beneficial both to the literate person and others (Buchanan\n2008).\n\nWhile most discussions of the ethics of genetic enhancement have\nfocused on whether the practice is ever permissible, some ethicists\nargue that it is not only permissible for parents to enhance their\nchildren, but a positive duty. Savulescu (2001) argues for what he\ncalls the Principle of Procreative Beneficence: couples should use\npre-genetic diagnosis and selective abortion to choose the child, of\nthe children they could have, who will have the best life. This\nnaturally extends to using genetic enhancement. Savulescu\u2019s\njustification for the principle of Procreative Beneficence is that it\nseems irrational not to select the best child when no other reasons\nare relevant to one\u2019s choice. But this seems like a very weak\nprinciple: it seems likely that at least some other reason will\nfrequently apply. For example, prospective parents might just prefer\nto leave their child\u2019s genetic makeup up to chance. If this is\nnot an irrational preference, then it plausibly gives some reason for\nthem not to select any particular embryo to implant. Savulescu\u2019s\nview is extended in further papers which claim that the principle of\nProcreative Beneficence has greater moral weight than simply being a\ntiebreaker when no other reasons apply (Savulescu and Kahane 2009,\n281; for criticism see Parker 2010, Carter and Gordon 2013, Bennett\n2014). These and related issues are discussed at length in the entries\non\n enhancement and\n eugenics.\n\nFinally, controversy is not limited to genetic interventions: there\nare live debates about whether parents may choose (male) circumcision,\nclitoridectomy, marrow donation, sex assignment of inter-sexed\nchildren, and other surgical interventions (see, e.g., Benatar and\nBenatar 2003 on circumcision; Parens 2006, on surgically shaping\nchildren).\n3.5 State Policies\n\nMany bioethicists move beyond a focus on individual rights to consider\nbroader effects of reproductive policy. As discussed in 2.2, these\ninclude communitarian conservatives who are concerned with the effects\nof reproductive policy, particularly regarding ARTs, on social\nattitudes towards the value of life and the meaning of family (Sandel\n2007). They also include liberals who share values of autonomy and\nequality with repro-libertarians, and as a result treat market\nexchanges and consensual services as \u201cinnocent until proven\nguilty.\u201d But rather than focusing just on the effects of\nparticular procreative choices, these liberals also attend to the\nimpact of institutionalizing practices such as genetic selection or\nIVF within a society that aims to maintain liberal background\ninstitutions (Glover et al. 1989; Buchanan et al. 2000; Brock 2005).\nInstitutionalization foregrounds concerns that liberals focused on\nindividual choices downplay, such as the effects of large numbers, the\nincentives that policies create, and opportunity costs. Thus for\npolicy liberals it will be impossible to determine the scope of\nprocreative rights without considering institutional structure and\nsocial context, given reasonable assumptions about human\nmotivations.\n\nFor instance, when many people make similar reproductive choices, the\nresulting \u201cbaby boom\u201d may reshape the social, economic,\npolitical, and environmental landscape. Such concerns apply to the use\nof ARTs, such as for sex selection: sex ratios might become grossly\nskewed in countries with a strong preference for male children (Xue\n2010). Such societal consequences are also predicted by disability\ntheorists who argue that normalizing genetic testing and embryo\nselection or abortion to prevent certain impairments could lead to\nincreased stigma against and decreased resources for people with such\nimpairments (see also the entry on\n disability).\n Such concerns might provide grounds for restricting ARTs or\nincentivizing their use.\n\nMuch recent debate has focused on the effects of the legal institution\nof the family on procreative choices and child welfare. Arguments for\nincentivizing procreation within marriage assume that children reared\nwithin marriages will benefit as contrasted with those reared outside\nmarriages (Galston 1991, chap. 10; but see Young 1995). Others have\nargued that legally separating marriage and parenting will allow the\nstate to support both children and their caregivers more directly\n(Shrage 2018) or that recognizing more than two parents will benefit\nchildren as well as serving broader social goals such as resource\nconservation (Gheaus 2019, Grill 2020). Such revisionist arguments\nextend to legal institutionalization of non-parental care for\nchildren: for example, Gheaus has argued for the institutional\nprovision of non-parental care on child welfare grounds (Gheaus 2011,\n2018b), and Brake for the legal recognition of paid childcare workers\nas family (Brake 2018). Liberal feminists have argued for state family\npolicy\u2014such as parental leave and incentives for egalitarian\nco-parenting\u2014to promote gender equality (e.g., Schouten 2019).\nAdoption policy has also been the focus of recent discussion, with\ndebates over open adoption and attention to the difficulties of LGBT\nadoption (Haslanger and Witt 2006; Baylis and McLeod 2014, Part IV).\nFamily policy also has effects on racial equality, as Dorothy Roberts\npoints out in her criticism of state policies on terminating parental\nrights which disporpotionately affect black families (Roberts\n2006).\n\nLiberal accounts of procreative autonomy may face problems in a\ncontext of social inequality and over-population. Some affirm\nprocreative autonomy, but regard it as compatible with apparently\ncoercive population policies such as limitations on the number of\nchildren particular persons may have. This may be because they regard\nprocreative autonomy as a merely prima facie right, less weighty than\nother rights, such as the right to a minimally decent quality of life\n(Bayles 1979). Or they may conceive of procreative autonomy more\nnarrowly than is commonly done (O\u2019Neill 1979; Hill 1991).\nO\u2019Neill, for example, construes procreative autonomy as\nrequiring an intention to rear the resulting child so that it has a\nlife at least normal for its society. Without such intentions, parents\nare not exercising a right to procreate, and thus policies to curtail\ntheir behavior do not constitute coercive infringements of procreative\nautonomy. Recent work in this area has examined the extent to which\nthe state is justified in restricting procreation in light of its\nenvironmental costs (e.g., Conly 2016). In sum, on such views,\nprocreative autonomy is one among many important forms of autonomy,\nwhich may conflict among themselves, and with the state\u2019s\nlegitimate (or compulsory) ends such as the provision of public goods\nand compliance with national constitutions. Talk of rights, from such\na standpoint, is appropriate only within a nexus of liberties, claims,\npowers, and ends. From such a perspective, the implications of a right\nto procreative autonomy are much less straightforward than from the\nindividually focused repro-libertarian perspective.\n\nOne further problem for liberals is posed by divergent societal views\non the nature of the good for children. Respecting such divergent\nviews seems to be required by equal respect, but this is in tension\nwith the need to define standards for child welfare and parental\nauthority. For example, balancing child welfare and parent autonomy\nmay be difficult in culturally diverse societies, in which state\nstandards of child welfare may be criticized as discriminatory against\nchild-rearing practices of cultural minorities (e.g., Dwyer 2018; for\ndiscussion of child welfare and state neutrality, see Fowler 2010 and\n2014).\n3.6 A Right Not to Procreate?\n\nWhile we have set aside the question of abortion, we will briefly\naddress two other cases in which avoiding procreation and parenthood\nhas been taken as protected by procreative autonomy. First is the case\nof legal paternity assignment for the purposes of child support,\nparticularly in the case of \u201cinvoluntary fathers.\u201d Second\nis the case of the disposition of frozen embryos created from the\ngametes of two people who now disagree on their use. We can usefully\ndistinguish rights not to become a gestational parent, not to become a\nlegal parent, and not to become a genetic parent (Cohen 2007, 1140).\nThe cases we are concerned with in this section relate to the two\nlatter (alleged) rights: not to become a legal or a genetic\nparent.\n\nWhile avoiding unwanted paternity has become a topic for the\n\u201cmen\u2019s rights\u201d movement, arguments for a\n\u201cfather\u2019s right to choose\u201d can begin from feminist\ndefenses of procreative autonomy. What is at issue here is not whether\nan unwilling father has the right to compel a pregnant woman to have\nan abortion \u2013 this would be an intolerable invasion of her\nprocreative autonomy \u2013 but whether he should be assigned the\nlegal status, and legal support obligations, of fatherhood. If women\nhave the right to avoid the status and burdens of motherhood, by\nparity of reasoning \u2013 the argument goes \u2013 men should have\nthe right to avoid the status and burdens of fatherhood. Of course,\nthe physical burdens of pregnancy provide a clear disanalogy between\nthe cases (for related legal arguments against arguing from abortion\ncases to genetic parenthood cases, see Cohen 2007). But dismissing the\ncomparison too quickly risks inattention to the costs of \u201cforced\nfatherhood\u201d on worse-off men (and their disproportionate\nenforcement on men of color in the US) (Brake 2005). Some would argue\nthat even if men have the right to avoid involuntary fatherhood\n(especially in cases such as a \u201cpurloined sperm\u201d case, in\nwhich they can deny moral responsibility), the claims of children\noutweigh a right not to become a parent (Overall 2012).\n\nCases of dispute over frozen embroyos, such as Evans v. the United\nKingdom, foreground issues of privacy and control over\none\u2019s genetic material \u2013 especially, whether there is a\nright not to become a genetic parent (again, here we set aside the\nquestion of the moral status of the embryo). In the Evans\ncase, a couple produced embryos through IVF, intending to\nprocreate together, but separated before the embryos could be\nimplanted. Subsequently, the man involved asked that the embryos be\ndestroyed; the law required that both parties consent for the\nprocedure to continue. The woman brought a legal challenge, hoping to\nproceed with implantation.\n\nConsiderations of procreative autonomy, control of one\u2019s genetic\nmaterial, could be brought to bear on either side here. Is there a\nright not to become a genetic parent, and if so, does it override any\nother rights or moral considerations pertinent to such disagreements?\nA right not to become a genetic parent could be grounded in privacy or\nproperty right in one\u2019s genetic material (including\ninformational). But once the embryo is intentionally created with the\nconsent of the gamete donor, it may be argued that any prior property\nclaims are ceded; the genetic contribution cannot be retrieved from\nthis \u201cmiscible joint property\u201d (Chan and Quigley 2007; see\nalso Cohen 2007). On one feminist perspective, the woman who has\nundergone IVF ought to control the embryos, because of the additional\nburdens of the procedure and any future treatments on her (Overall\n1995).\n\nThe resolution to these questions depends, at least in part, on the\nunderlying moral grounds of parenthood. For example, if one acquires\nparental moral obligations by causing a child to exist, that will have\nvery different implications than if one only acquires such obligations\nthrough a voluntary undertaking. The next section will examine such\naccounts of the moral grounds of parenthood.\n4. Becoming Parents\n\nIn virtue of what does one become a moral parent, i.e., a primary\nbearer of parental rights and/or parental responsibilities with\nrespect to a particular child? We can distinguish four general\nanswers: genetic, labor-based, intentional (or voluntarist), and\ncausal accounts. On monistic versions, only one of these properties\ngenerates parental relationships. On pluralistic accounts, more than\none of these relations can ground parenthood.\n\nSome contemporary discussions assume that moral parental rights and\nresponsibilities or obligations are inseparable (Bayne and Kolers\n2003). But Archard has argued that this \u201cparental package\u201d\nview is untenable (Archard and Benatar 2010, 22\u201325; Archard\n2010; see also Austin 2007, chap. 3). To take Archard\u2019s example,\nan estranged, abusive parent may have moral and legal support\nobligations but no parental rights; obligations to ensure a child is\nprovided for do not entail parental rights. It is more plausible, as\nArchard notes, that parental rights and responsibilities\u2014which,\nas contrasted with obligations, concern the hands-on, day-to-day\nrearing of the child\u2014come together. Even these, in some\ncircumstances, might come apart\u2014as when an estranged parent\nretains some decision-making rights but holds no responsibilities.\nMoreover, the grounds for parental rights and parental\nresponsibilities may be distinct, even if parents typically have both.\nFor example, Millum argues for a labor-based account of parental\nrights but a voluntarist account of parental responsibilities (Millum\n2017).\n4.1 Genetic accounts\n\nGenetic theories ground parenthood in the relation of direct genetic\nderivation. Geneticism thus places parenthood in the nexus of other\nfamilial relations, such as being a sibling, cousin, and so on, which\nappear to have a genetic basis and which appear (at least to some) to\ncome along with certain moral rights and responsibilities.\n\nHall (1999) defends geneticism by appeal to the Lockean notion of\nself-ownership. Since genetic parents own the genetic material from\nwhich the child is constituted, they have a prima facie parental claim\nto the child. There are a number of problems with this line of\nargument (Kolers & Bayne 2001) and it is an argument that Locke\nhimself rejected (Franklin-Hall 2012). First, it subsumes parental\nrelations under property relations, by attempting to derive a claim\nabout parenthood from premises involving claims about ownership. The\nplausibility of this derivation is based on emphasizing parental\nrights associated with exclusivity and authority, and downplaying\nparental responsibilities. Those responsibilities\u2014to both child\nand community\u2014pull sharply against a property-based analysis of\nparenthood. Second, taking self-ownership seriously entails that\nchildren own themselves, and this surely defeats any proprietary claim\nthat their parents might have in them (Archard 1990). Third, genetic\nparents do not provide the material from which the child is\nconstituted in utero; that derives from the gestational mother, not\nthe genetic parents (Silver 2001). Of course, the child\u2019s\ngenetic make-up structures that matter, but to argue for the priority\nof the genetic over the gestational contribution is to argue for the\npriority of form over matter, and it is not obvious that this can be\ndone.\n\nOther arguments for geneticism derive from considering paternity, in\nthat direct genetic derivation appears to provide the most plausible\naccount of the basis of fatherhood. Several recent legal cases have\noverturned adoptions on the grounds that the estranged father,\nunidentified at the time of birth, has returned to claim the child\n(Rosenman 1995, Shanley 1995). Supporters of these decisions endorse\nthe view that unalienated genetic claims to children can override\nmonths or even years of rearing by the adoptive parents, as well as\nthe earlier failure of the father to claim the child. Similarly, in\n\u201csurrogacy\u201d cases, many writers have argued\u2014or\nsimply assumed\u2014that a genetic father may have his own child by\ncontracting with a surrogate mother. This seems to presuppose a\ngenetic account of paternity; and it is a small step from a genetic\naccount of paternity to a genetic account of parenthood. One need\nappeal only to the principle of \u201cparity,\u201d according to\nwhich the sort of relationship that makes one person a parent suffices\nto make anyone else a parent (Bayne & Kolers 2003; Austin\n2004).\n4.2 Labor-based accounts\n\nAn alternative account views parents\u2019 work, rather than their\ngenetic relationships, as essential to the parental relation.\nAccording to these labor-based accounts, people who play or have\nplayed a parental role in a child\u2019s life have thereby become the\nparents. In this spirit, a number of authors have argued that the\nprimary ground of parenthood is the gestational relation (Rothman\n1989; Feldman 1992). In reproductive contexts in which a child\u2019s\ngestational mother differs from its genetic mother\u2014as in egg (or\nembryo) donation and gestational surrogacy\u2014it is therefore the\ngestational mother who has the primary claim to parental rights and\nresponsibilities. This line of argument can be expanded to include\npeople besides the gestational mother who have taken a parental role\nin rearing a child (Millum 2010; 2017).\n\nThree main considerations are presented in favor of labor-based\naccounts. One focuses on the interests of the child. Where a child has\nbeen looked after by a person or people for some time, it is thought\nto be very damaging for her to be taken away from them (Archard 2004).\nIn the case of gestation, since the gestational mother is guaranteed\nto be identifiable at birth, it may be thought in the best interests\nof the child that she be regarded as the mother (Annas 1984).\nMoreover, the child and gestator are already involved in an intimate\nrelationship at birth, which it is arguably prima facie wrong to sever\n(Gheaus 2018a). However, while recognizing the gestational mother or\ncaregivers as parents will sometimes serve the best interests of the\nchild, it is implausible that this will always be the case. This\nargument might, at best, ground laws presuming that the gestational\nmother and rearing parents have a claim to be the legal parents. Since\nthere will likely be cases in which being reared by someone else would\nbe better for the child, it will be difficult to justify the\nassignment of parenthood on the grounds of labor in every case.\n\nA second line of argument appeals to what parents deserve for the work\nthey do. Gestational mothers typically invest a substantial amount of\neffort into the child. In Narayan\u2019s words, a gestational mother\ntypically undergoes \u201cconsiderable discomfort, effort, and risk\nin the course of pregnancy and childbirth\u201d (Narayan 1999, 81;\nalso Gheaus 2012). While this account appears to give a special role\nto gestational mothers, it can include parenting partners who help\nbear the costs or contribute to establishing a relationship (for\nexample, by viewing an ultrasound image together). Similarly, the\npeople who care for a child invest a great deal of work. It might\ntherefore be thought that they deserve to be the parents (Millum 2010;\n2017).\n\nLabor-based accounts have the advantage over genetic accounts that\nthey can explain why the individuals they pick out as the parents\nought to have parental rights. They also incorporate adoptive and\nother non-biological parental relationships into a single account of\nparenthood, whereas genetic accounts seem forced to view\nnon-biological parenthood as a distinct type of normative\nrelationship. Objections to gestationalist accounts of parenthood may\nstart from the problem of paternity: if gestation is necessary for\nparenthood, how can men become fathers (Bayne & Kolers 2003)?\nBroader labor-based accounts that count the work of other caregivers\ncan explain fatherhood, but they still seem to give the gestational\nmother veto power over other potential parents. As Barbara Katz\nRothman puts it: \u201cif men want to have children, they will either\nhave to develop the technology that enables them to become pregnant\n\u2026 or have children through their relationships with\nwomen\u201d (Rothman 1989, 257). Some will find this implausible.\n4.3 Intentional and voluntarist accounts\n\nA third approach to parenthood, popular with legal theorists, appeals\nto intentions as the ground of parenthood (Hill 1991; Parker 1982;\nShultz 1990; Stumpf 1986). Intentionalists motivate their position by\nappeal to cases like the following. The Khans wish to have a child\n\u201cof their own.\u201d They screen egg and sperm providers and\nfind providers who satisfy their requirements. They then select a\ngestational mother, who carries the fetus to term and then hands the\ninfant over to the Khans. Intentionalists argue that because they\n\u201ccarefully and intentionally orchestrated the procreational act,\nbringing together all the necessary components with the intention of\ncreating a unique individual whom they intend to raise as their\nown\u201d (Hill 1991, 359), the Khans should be regarded as the\nchild\u2019s sole parents.\n\nAnother argument for intentionalism appeals to the \u201ccase of the\nmisplaced sperm\u201d:\n\n\nBruce is about to undergo some risky medical treatment, and has placed\nsome of his sperm in a sperm-bank in case he needs it at a later date.\nThrough a bureaucratic mishap, Bruce\u2019s sperm is swapped with\nthat of a sperm-donor and is used by Bessie to produce a child. Does\nBruce acquire parental rights and responsibilities over Bessie\u2019s\nchild?\n\n\nIntuitions vary here, but there is at least some pull towards denying\nthat Bruce\u2019s genetic relation to Bessie\u2019s child gives him\nany parental claim over it. The reason Bruce lacks a parental relation\nto Bessie\u2019s child seems to be that he didn\u2019t intentionally\nbring the child into existence.\n\nIntentionalism construes parenthood as relying on facts about agency\nrather than biology; for the intentionalist, parenthood is\nfundamentally a moral relationship rather than a biological one (see\nFuscaldo 2006, for discussion). Some philosophical defenses of\nintentionalism appeal to a voluntaristic account of responsibilities\nin general (Van Zyl 2002). If special obligations to particular others\nare generally acquired voluntarily, then it is plausible that parental\nobligations are also voluntarily incurred (O\u2019Neill 1979; Brake\n2005, 2010; for criticism see Prusak 2011a, b). Furthermore, parental\nobligations are role obligations. While it is a matter of debate\nwhether any role obligations can be acquired involuntarily, it is at\nleast plausible that roles assumed as adults (as opposed to roles one\nis born into) require voluntary acceptance. Finally, parental role\nobligations are conventional: their scope and content varies by\njurisdiction and society. This suggests an unfairness if such\nextensive obligations are incurred involuntarily (Brake 2010). On the\nother hand, once it is recognized that parental obligations are\nconventional, the content of parental obligations and the voluntary\nactions required to acquire them can be explained with reference to\nsocial conventions of parenthood (Millum 2008; 2017). Another defense\nof intentionalism appeals to parental autonomy, as opposed to the way\nin which obligations are incurred: Richards argues for a variant of\nthe intentional view according to which parental rights derive from\n\u201ca right to continue [projects] we have underway\u201d\n(Richards 2010, 23).\n\nOne objection to intentionalism concerns the content of the intentions\nthat are supposed to ground parenthood. Consider a case in which a\ncouple conceives by accident and then form intentions to give up the\nbaby for adoption rather than rear it. This intention endures until 15\nminutes after birth, at which point they change their minds and decide\nto rear the child. It is highly implausible that for the first 15\nminutes of the child\u2019s life they are no more its parents than\nanyone else.\n\nPerhaps the most widespread objection to the voluntarist account is\nthat it seems to absolve unintending procreators from parental\nobligation. However, many share the view that procreators, intending\nor not, who voluntarily engaged in sex have a moral responsibility to\na resulting child due to their role in causing it to exist (Austin\n2007; Fuscaldo 2006; Millum 2008).\n\nWhatever the prospects of a voluntarist account of parenthood, a\nvoluntarist account of familial relations in general is implausible.\nThe duties that siblings have to each other, or that children have to\ntheir parents, are not easily understood as voluntary undertakings.\nThis is a problem for voluntarist accounts of parenthood to the extent\nthat duties between parents and children should fit within a wider\nframework of familial duties (Rachels 1989; Mills 2003; see Mullin\n2010, for discussion; and the entry on\n special obligations).\n4.4 Causal accounts\n\nFinally, parenthood may be grounded in causation (Nelson 1991; Bigelow\net al. 1988; Blustein 1997; Archard 2010). A causal account differs\nfrom intentionalism in that one can cause something without intending\nto do so. Indeed, one can cause a certain state of affairs even when\none is unaware that one\u2019s actions could do so. One needn\u2019t\nhave grasped the connection between sexual intercourse and pregnancy\nin order to be the cause of a child\u2019s existence.\n\nOne of the attractions of causalism is its promise to account for the\nplausibility of genetic, labor-based, and intentional accounts of\nparenthood. Genetic, gestational, and caregiving relationships\ncontribute to the child\u2019s existence or development, and, in the\ncases that some intentionalists appeal to, the commissioning couple\nare a cause of the child\u2019s existence. Causalism offers to\nexplain its competitors.\n\nBut causal accounts face problems: first, what is meant by\n\u201ccausation\u201d in this context? \u2018But-for\u2019\ncausation is too weak to ground parenthood, because its scope is so\nwide: for example, procreation might not have occurred\n\u2018but-for\u2019 the urgings of would-be grandparents or the\nactions of the match-making friend who introduced the parents. This is\nthe \u201ctoo many parents\u201d problem (Hanna 2019). But it is\nunclear what notion of causation the causal theorist should adopt\ninstead of \u2018but-for\u2019 causation (Blustein 1997). Second,\nwhat implications does the causal account have? Even with a\nsatisfactory account of causation it may be unclear whom the account\nascribes parenthood to in any particular case\u2014or if it is clear\nenough, there is a risk of an ad hoc account of causation tailor-made\nfor this purpose. Concern with the arbitrariness of the causal chain\nby means of which a child may be created leads writers such as\nFuscaldo (2006) to emphasize that what is wanted is not a theory of\ncausation but of agency (see also Austin 2004, 2007). This leads\ncausal theorists back in the direction of intentionalism.\n\nA related problem is that causal accounts often leave it unclear how\ncausal responsibility generates moral responsibility. Sometimes it\nappears that the thought is that procreators, by causing a child to\nexist, have placed it in a needy position and so owe it, as\ncompensation, \u201cprocreative costs.\u201d But these costs are\narguably not equivalent to the weighty responsibilities of parenthood\n(Brake 2010). The question is whether, as a result of causal\nresponsibility for their existence, parents merely owe children repair\nof their needy condition, by fostering survival to adulthood, or\nwhether such \u201cprocreative costs\u201d include a richer set of\nparental responsibilities, such as a duty to love and to make the\nchild \u201ccontent with his condition\u201d (Prusak 2011b, 67).\n\nOne final alternative, as noted above, is a \u2018pluralist\u2019\naccount which allows that more than one of these relations (such as\ncausation or intention) may be sufficient, but not necessary, for\nparenthood (Bayne and Kolers 2003). Pluralist accounts have not yet\nbeen developed in depth.\n\nHaving outlined the main theories of the grounds of parenthood, we\nturn now to questions concerning the morality of being a parent.\n5. Being Parents\n5.1 Parental Rights\n\nParents have moral and legal rights regarding their children. They\nhave the liberty to make decisions on behalf of their children\nregarding matters such as diet, schooling, association with others,\nand\u2014more controversially\u2014religious observance, and the\nright to exclude others from such decision-making. Such rights\ndecrease in strength and scope as children gain decision-making\ncapacity, yet until the child reaches moral or legal competence,\nissues of substituted judgment and surrogate decision-making remain\n(Ross 2002).\n\nParental rights\u2019 content, extent, and relation to parental\nobligations is determined by the underlying theory of why parents\npossess such rights. On the child-centered or fiduciary model,\nparental rights piggyback on parental responsibilities to children,\nwhich are morally fundamental. One such theory is Blustein\u2019s\n\u201cpriority thesis.\u201d According to the priority thesis,\nparents acquire rights in order to carry out their responsibilities;\nthus responsibilities are morally prior to rights (Blustein 1982,\n104\u2013114). As Archard writes, \u201cA parent can choose for his\nchild, and exclude others from the making of these choices, only in\nthe service of and thus constrained by a duty to care for the child.\nIt is in the first instance because a dependent child must have\ndecisions made for it that a designated parent is entitled to make\nthose decisions.\u201d (Archard 2010, 108; see also Brennan and\nNoggle 1997; Austin 2007).\n\nOther theories of parental rights focus on parents\u2019 interests.\nHistorically, parenthood has often been regarded as a possessory (or\nproprietary) relationship. Some genetic accounts of parenthood imply\nthe proprietarian view that parents own their children (see 4.1; Hall\n1999; Narveson 2002). However, property rights seem inappropriate here\nfor several reasons: children cannot be sold and they cannot be used\nhowever the parent wishes. While it might be responded that parental\nproperty rights are limited, prohibiting sale and certain uses, this\ndoes not address the more fundamental objection that persons cannot be\nproperty.\n\nOther theories provide more plausible support for parent-centered, as\nopposed to child-centered, accounts of parental rights in terms of\nparents\u2019 interests. Brighouse and Swift argue for parental\nrights on the basis of the irreplaceable good offered by parenting.\nBecause parenting is a project with goods which cannot be obtained\nthrough other activities, such as the responsibility of caring for a\nchild and the receipt of children\u2019s spontaneous trust,\naffection, and intimacy, the interest in parenting should be\nprotected. On this account, parental rights, not parental obligations,\nare fundamental, because the parents\u2019 interests are the basis\nfor the right (Brighouse and Swift 2006, 2014; see also Shoeman 1980).\nOne line of objection is to ask whether the interest in parenting is\nlikely to be undermined by state intervention in parental\ndecision-making. Here we can usefully distinguish at least three\ndifferent kinds of parental interests which could ground parental\nrights to control aspects of their children\u2019s lives: interests\nin being a fiduciary, interests in intimacy, and interests in\n\u201cnurturing, counseling, and education.\u201d Intimacy and being\na fiduciary, which Brighouse and Swift appeal to, arguably need not be\nundermined by intervention \u2013 whereas an interest in\nauthentically nurturing children into adults might (Altman 2018).\n\nThe parental-interest account of parents\u2019 rights addresses\nproblems raised within political philosophy for the family. Brighouse\nand Swift generate their account partly in response to the challenge\nof redistribution of children: if the state should promote child\nwelfare, why should children not be redistributed at birth to the best\nprospective parents, to maximize children\u2019s welfare? But as\nGheaus points out, while Brighouse and Swift provide an account of\nfundamental parental rights, they do not explain why biological\nparents have rights to rear their biological children, rather than\nsuch children being redistributed to better prospective parents, who\ncould thereby undertake their own parenting projects (Gheaus 2012).\nOne response to this concern is to separate the question of how\nsomeone obtains parental rights (the topic of the previous section)\nfrom the question of whose interests\u2014parent, child, or\nboth\u2014those rights ultimately protect (Millum 2017). Brighouse\nand Swift also aim to address the family\u2019s notorious effect on\nequal opportunity \u2013 different parenting practices, such as\nreading bedtime stories, can greatly affect children\u2019s life\nchances. On their account, certain inequality-producing institutions\nsuch as private schools and inheritances are not protected under\nparents\u2019 rights \u2013 but practices essential to\nparents\u2019 interest in intimacy, such as bedtime stories, are.\n(For a reply, see Engster 2019.) Finally, a dual-interest view,\ngrounding rights in interests of both parents and children, is also\npossible (Macleod 2015).\n\nOne question concerning parental rights is their strength. Parental\nrights entitle parents to exclude others, including the state, from\nchild-rearing decisions. For critics, the absolute exclusivity typical\nof contemporary western nuclear families gives parents too much power\nover the vulnerable children in their care (Card 1996, Gheaus 2011;\nsee also Gheaus 2018b).\n\nAn important set of questions about the content of parental rights\nconcerns their scope. While it is widely agreed that parents have\nrights to make many day-to-day decisions on behalf of their children,\na number of purported rights have been questioned.\n\nOne controversial right is the right to infuse children with\nparents\u2019 religious beliefs. On the one hand, handing down such\nbeliefs to children is, to many, a key aspect of the parental project\n(Brighouse and Swift 2006, 2014; Galston 2011). On the other hand,\nClayton argues that raising one\u2019s child in a religion violates a\nrequirement of liberal neutrality, which applies to parents just as it\napplies to states (Clayton 2006; also Coleman 2003). From a feminist\nperspective, Okin argued that religious infusion could affect\ngirls\u2019 developing self-respect and equal opportunity (Okin 1994;\ncf. Chambers 2017, Chapter 6; Schouten 2017). Even if such arguments\ntheoretically justify state intervention, their proponents must\nexplain how, in practice, the state could intervene in the intimate\nparent-child relationship without psychologically harming\nchildren.\n\nAnother set of questions concerns parental authority over medical\ninterventions. Critics have argued that circumcision of male children\nviolates their bodily integrity; but children\u2019s rights to bodily\nintegrity must be weighed against other morally weighty interests,\nincluding the child\u2019s own interest in community membership\n(Benatar and Benatar 2003, Mazor 2019). Likewise, there is controversy\nover whether parents should have the right to prevent transgender\nadolescents from receiving puberty-blocking treatment; here, harm to\ntransgender children must be weighed (Priest 2019). In such conflicts,\nthere are tensions between parental control rights and\nchildren\u2019s rights, but also between different understandings of\nwhat the child\u2019s best interests require (particularly when the\nchild lacks decision-making capacity). (See entry on\n children\u2019s rights.)\n\nA related debate concerns the authority of parents to control their\nchild\u2019s education. Most discussion of this issue has focused on\nreligion-based objections to the duration or content of public\nschooling. This was the context in which Feinberg originally discussed\nthe child\u2019s \u201cright to an open future,\u201d which he\nregards as a constraint on parental discretion regarding their\nchild\u2019s schooling (1980, see below for further discussion). A\nkey challenge is how to justify these objections. One strategy is to\ncite the parents\u2019 right to freedom of religion, but then some\nargument must be given for why the apparent interests of a child in\nbeing educated should be sacrificed to their religious freedom. A\nseparate question regarding parental rights and education is whether\nparents are ethically permitted to confer advantages on their children\nthrough private schooling, particularly when doing so is expected to\nreduce the quality of education available to other children (Swift\n2003).\n\nOther questions concerning parental rights concern exclusivity and the\nnumber of possible parents. As step-parenting, procreation involving\nmultiple biological, gestational, and social parents, and other\ndiverse family forms become more prevalent, why should the number of\nparents be limited to two? As noted in Section 1 above, a Canadian\ncourt recognized a child as having three parents. Relatives in\naddition to the parents are frequently involved in raising children,\neven in cultures in which the nuclear family is considered the norm.\nIn the United States, nearly 3 million grandparents have primary\nresponsibility for children living in their homes and it has been\nargued that grandparental rights should be legally recognized\n(Henderson 2005). Further, some philosophers have argued for legal\nrecognition or support for non-parental care, as in, for example,\nAfrican-American practices of \u201cothermothering\u201d or\n\u201crevolutionary parenting.\u201d This would permit more adults\nto contribute to children\u2019s development, thereby arguably\nbenefiting children (Card 1996; Gheaus 2011 and 2019; hooks 1984;\nCollins 1991; Mullin 2005; see also\n 3.5\n above).\n\nSo far, we have considered parental rights as parents\u2019 moral and\nlegal claims to make, and exclude others from, decisions regarding\ntheir child. But some philosophers have argued for other rights held\nby parents\u2014namely, positive rights to social support for\nchild-rearing. These proposals are discussed in 5.2, as they aim at\nhelping parents discharge their responsibilities.\n5.2 Parental Responsibilities\n\nParenthood inhabits the intersection of two distinct relationships: a\ncustodial relationship between parent and child, and a trustee\nrelationship between the parents and the larger society or other\ncollective. Both may generate responsibilities.\n\nThe custodial relationship involves a set of duties aimed at, and\njustified by, the welfare of the child. As custodian, the parent is\nunder a limited obligation to work for and organize his or her life\naround the welfare and development of the child, for the child\u2019s\nsake. Analysis of the content of parental responsibilities has\ntherefore mostly focused on the rights of the child. Feinberg\u2019s\nright to an \u201copen future\u201d can be read as a limit on\nparental discretion (see 5.1). It can also be interpreted as giving\nchildren positive claims to certain goods, such as an education that\nleaves them with a wide range of valuable life plans to choose from.\nWhether there is such a positive right and in what it consists are\nmatters of dispute (Liao 2015; Mills 2003; Lotz 2006 and 2014; Millum\n2014; essays in Archard and Macleod 2002; entry on\n children\u2019s rights).\n Another question is whether parental responsibilities end when the\nchild reaches adulthood, or whether they are lifelong (Weinberg\n2018).\n\nSocieties, families, and cultural groups also have interests in the\nwelfare of children. For instance, the state has an interest in the\nreproduction of its workforce and its citizens; hence parental\ndecisions that threaten the child\u2019s chances of becoming a fully\nparticipating citizen may come under special state scrutiny. Distinct\ngroups, such as the state and cultural groups, may make conflicting\nclaims on the parents as trustees. For instance, in order to promote\nculturally prescribed norms, parents might seek to remove their child\nfrom school, or have their daughter undergo clitoridectomy; yet the\nstate may claim that such a decision violates the parents\u2019\ntrustee relationship on grounds that the state has a compelling\ninterest in securing the full citizenship capacities and rights of its\ncitizens (Galston 1995; Okin 1989; Chambers 2017, Chapter 6).\nMoreover, discharging parental responsibilities must be balanced with\ndischarging obligations of distributive and global justice (Archard\nand Macleod 2002, Part III; Macleod 2010).\n\nIndeed, some philosophers argue that parental responsibilities include\nduties towards social or environmental justice. For example, parents\narguably have a duty of egalitarian justice to guide their children\naway from \u201cexpensive consumption habits\u201d (Zwarthoed 2017).\nThey may, as parents, have duties to address climate change, on behalf\nof their children\u2019s, or children\u2019s children\u2019s,\ninterests (Cripps 2017; see also Gheaus 2016a, 2019). This may also\napply to special duties of adoptive parents, especially in\ninter-racial adoptions (Haslanger and Witt 2006, see also Baylis and\nMcLeod 2014).\n\nAll parents fail to meet their responsibilities at some point. We\nwould not expect someone to raise a child without making mistakes\nalong the way. However, at some point, excusable parental failings\nshade into neglect and abuse. Exactly what counts as child abuse is a\nmatter for debate. However, if abuse marks a threshold above which it\nis permissible for others\u2014particularly the state\u2014to\nintervene, then a clear definition is needed (Archard 2004, chap.\n14).\n\nBy the time neglect or abuse has reached the point that the state\nintervenes, irreparable damage has often been caused, and the actions\nthat can be taken to improve a child\u2019s situation are likely to\nbe limited. Some philosophers argue that prospective parents should be\nscreened ahead of time for their ability to parent and those who are\ndeemed unlikely to be able to fulfill their parental responsibilities\nshould not be granted parental licenses. The argument in favor of\nlicensing parents may appeal primarily to the harms to children that\noccur if unfit people are allowed to parent (LaFollette 1980, 2010) or\nto the wider impact on society from rearing children who are unlikely\nto become good citizens (McFall 2009). Either way proposals for\nparental licensing schemes must show that it is possible prospectively\nto identify individuals who are likely to be neglectful or abusive\nparents with sufficient accuracy, show that the schemes do not violate\nthe rights of prospective parents (on this see Liao 2015), and explain\nhow they are to be enforced. The latter is perhaps the hardest\nchallenge: without resorting to compulsory sterilization how can\npeople be prevented from having children without licenses? (McFall\n2009, 122) Of course, there could be penalties for unlicensed parents,\nor their children could be subject to confiscation, but such policies\nrisk inadvertently penalizing the children they were intended to\nassist. Moreover, enforcement would disproportionately burden women.\nAs gestators, women might be subjected to de facto forced abortions;\nwomen are also more likely to be primary caregivers, and thus\nsubjected to greater interference and monitoring (Engster 2010). A\nfurther question is whether onerous licensing policies for adoptive\nparents can be justified in the absence of more general parental\nlicensing schemes (McLeod and Botterell 2014).\n\nFinally, children need a great deal of care if they are to grow up\ninto autonomous, healthy adults and good citizens. Parents clearly\nhave the responsibility to provide some of this care, and the state\nhas the obligation to step in when parents are failing to do as they\nshould. However, there is an open question about what the state should\nprovide in cases that do not involve abuse or neglect. As Alstott has\nargued, parenting imposes opportunity costs on parents, for example,\nin earning potential. Moreover, child-care labor remains\ngender-structured, with women performing by far the greater share. On\nthese grounds Alstott argues for caregiver accounts to ensure equal\nopportunity, for example, allocating educational funds to parents\n(Alstott 2004). One pertinent question is whether parenting should be\nconsidered a private good, like an expensive taste which it would be\nunjust for society to subsidize (Taylor 2009). Some have responded\nthat it is a matter of justice due to its effects on equal opportunity\nfor women and full participation of women as equal citizens (Okin\n1989; Kittay 1999; Schouten 2019). Others have argued for collective\nsocial responsibility for children on grounds such as children\u2019s\nwelfare and their status as a public good, providing positive\nexternalities by reproducing society and producing workers who will\nsupport the current generation in old age (George 1987; Archard 2004;\nEngster 2010; Olsaretti 2013; Millum 2017).\n",
