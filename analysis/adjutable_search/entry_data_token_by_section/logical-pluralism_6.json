    "main_text": "Objections to Case-Based Logical Pluralism || The Metalogic Objection\n2.4 The Metalogic Objection\n\nRecent critics have raised the question of which logic a pluralist\nshould use for metalogic, i.e. for proving things or assessing\narguments about logics, including in assessing arguments for\npluralism itself. Suki Finn (2021) argues that pluralism must be\nconstrained on the grounds that the metalogic must always contain both\nuniversal elimination and modus ponens. A new book by Griffiths and\nPaseau (2022: 50\u201355) argues that the pluralist can tell no\ncoherent story about the metalogic at all.\n\nPresumably the arguments for logical pluralism presuppose some logic\naccording to which certain argumentative moves are legitimate, others\nnot. But which logic is this?\n\nGriffiths and Paseau\u2019s argument proceeds by cases. They survey a\nlist of answers a pluralist might give and argue that each is\nunsatisfactory. For example, one option for the pluralist is to say\nthat an argument for pluralism should be acceptable in every\ncorrect logic. But for pluralists who accept a very large number of\nlogics (so-called eclectic pluralists), there will be too few\nshared principles to support interesting arguments, and so the\nmetalogic will be too weak to establish anything very much.\n\nOne might instead be a so-called modest pluralist and accept\nBeall and Restall\u2019s restrictions on what would count as a logic:\nnecessity, formality, and normativity. Such a modest pluralist could\nfind themselves with a more restricted set of logics, and thus a\nlarger set of shared principles, giving them a stronger metalogic on\nthis approach. But Griffiths and Paseau argue that this overall\nposition is under-motivated:\n\n\n[Beall and Restall\u2019s] test for whether a feature should be\nconsidered settled is historical\u2026 If we look to the tradition\nof writing about consequence we apparently find some\nfeatures\u2014necessity, formality, and normativity\u2014settled,\nand others\u2014axiomatizability, a priori\nknowability\u2014unsettled. When we consider the tradition, however,\nno such picture emerges. Rather, we find a thoroughly unsettled\npicture that couldn\u2019t possibly motivate a modest variety of\npluralism. It would certainly be hard to argue that some feature is\nmore part of the tradition than the idea of monism itself: so if\nanything is a settled feature, it\u2019s the thought that there is\none correct logic. (2022: 51)\n\n\nA further option for the pluralist is to be to be a monist about the\nmetalogic, though continuing to allow that other logics may be used\nwhen we are not doing metalogic. Griffiths and Paseau argue that this\nposition is unstable. For suppose the pluralist accepts two logics,\nsay LP and K3, as correct, but for the metalogic they accept only\nclassical. Now we are presented with an argument (in the object\nlanguage) that uses modus ponens:  \n\\[P, P \\rightarrow Q \\vDash Q.\\]\n\n\nThis is valid in K3 but not in LP. So now what about this\nargument:\n\n\n\u201c\\(P\\)\u201d is true. \n\n\u201c\\(P\\rightarrow Q\\)\u201d is\ntrue. \n\n\u201c\\(Q\\)\u201d is true. \n\n\nEach premise states that one of the premises of the original instance\nof modus ponens is true, and the conclusion states that the conclusion\nof the instance of modus ponens is true. Unlike the original argument\nhowever, this one employs only metalinguistic sentences, and we might\nexpect it to be a place where the hypothetical strategy tells us to\nuse classical logic\u2014the logic for the metalanguage\u2014and\nhence that the current strand of pluralism would infer that the\nconclusion\u2014\u201cQ\u201d is true\u2014is true. But if\nso, why not just disquote and get Q? The metalogical monist\nseems to be able to get around their weak logic in the object language\nby ascending to the metalevel, making the argumentative step there,\nand then disquoting to get back to the object language.\n\nThe underlying issue is that the truth-values of sentences in the\nobject language and metalanguage are not independent. The simplest\nrelationship between them would be an unrestricted biconditional\ndisquotation principle:\n\n\u201c\\(P\\)\u201d is true if and only if\n\\(P\\) \n\nSuch principles are highly intuitive, though commonly restricted to\navoid paradox. Yet even with the restrictions, a strong relationship\nbetween the truth-values of sentences in the object language and in\nthe metalanguage remains. And since validity concerns patterns of\ntruth-preservation over sentences, there is reason to suspect that the\nlogic of the metalanguage can\u2019t be completely independent from\nthe logic of the object language. Griffiths and Paseau (2022: 54) use\nthe same strategy to dismiss the idea that the metalogic for a\npluralist might be an \u201carbitrary correct logic\u201d, since (as\nthey put it) \u201cthe true metalogic must be in harmony with the\ntrue object-level logics\u201d.\n\nThe final option that Griffiths and Paseau consider on behalf of the\nlogical pluralist is that there might be an argument for each accepted\nlogic without there being a single argument which is valid according\nto all of those logics. There might be different arguments, as long as\nfor each logic, \\(L\\), the pluralist accepts there is at least one\nvalid\\(_L\\) argument for pluralism. Here the worry is again that the\neclectic pluralist\u2019s weakest logic is likely to be too weak to\nprovide such an argument, and that the modest pluralist\u2019s\nrestriction to a set of stronger logics is unmotivated.\n2.4.1 Breaking metalogical harmony\n\nLet\u2019s consider what a logical pluralist might say in response to\nquestions about the metalogic. Griffiths and Paseau have tendency to\nwrite as if the only kinds of pluralist are (a) the eclectic, who\nembraces a plethora of non-standard logics\u2014perhaps out of a\nspirit of generous inclusivity\u2014and (b) the modest, who has found\nany desire to be inclusive constrained by their loyalty to the history\nof logic, which insists on logics being necessary, formal, and\nnormative. But a different, quite realistic, kind of pluralist is\nmotivated by a combination of different monists\u2019 arguments,\nalong with a desire not to be stuck with too weak a logic.\n\nSo suppose\u2014for the sake of a concrete example\u2014that deviant\nmonist A argues that empty names make a sentence neither true nor\nfalse, and that we should accept the gappy logic K3 as the only\nlogic for this reason. By contrast, deviant monist B argues from the\nsemantic paradoxes to the view that a sentence can be both true\nand false, and moreover that we should accept the logic LP as the\nonly logic on these grounds. Now consider someone who studies the\nviews of both deviant monists A and B, and agrees that empty\nnames and the semantic paradoxes give rise to sentences which are\nneither or both respectively. That person cannot be\na K3-monist (because of the semantic paradoxes) but nor can they be an\nLP-monist (because of the empty names). Rather, they have two choices:\naccept only the entailments shared by both logics\u2014perhaps\naccepting the very weak Logic of First Degree Entailment (FDE) or\nsimilar as the only logic\u2014or instead relativise\nvalidity to the phenomena we are engaging with. Where you have a\nlanguage with no empty names: use LP. In the absence of semantic\nparadoxes: use K3. Where both are in the offing, you are stuck with\nFDE. But when working in languages which have neither empty names nor\nthe resources to formulate the semantic paradoxes, go ahead and use\nthe full-resources of classical logic.\n\nThis last step resembles the move that is sometimes called\n\u201cclassical recapture\u201d\u2014something which is common\namong subclassical monists (see, e.g., Priest 2006: 198 and Rosenblatt\n2022). For example, a monist intuitionist motivated by constructivism\nin mathematics may think that it is fine to use instances of the\nclassical law of excluded middle when the topic is something other\nthan infinite mental constructions. And a paraconsistent logician may\nthink that it is fine to use instances of the classical principle EFQ\nwhen working in a language not rich enough to formulate the paradoxes.\nNeither accepts the principles as logically valid\u2014on\nthe grounds that they are not reliable in mathematics or when\nreasoning about the paradoxes. But that doesn\u2019t mean that you\ncan never make use of their safer instances. In fact, the situations\nin which they fail might be quite esoteric and rarely encountered in\neveryday life.\n\nThough it is standard to refer to such work as \u201cclassical\u201d\nrecapture, it need not aim at recovering classical principles\nspecifically; what is key is that it permits limited use of the\nprinciples from some stronger logic, and so here we will refer to it\nas strength recapture, or sometimes just recapture\nfor short. \n\nThe pluralist response is slightly different: instead of saying that\nit is often fine to use invalid arguments (since they are often,\nthough not universally, truth-preserving) they relativise validity\nitself to the phenomena which disrupt it. In our example, they say\nthat: classical logic is valid on languages which lack empty names and\nwithout the resources to form paradoxes; whereas on languages with\nempty names but no paradoxes, K3 is valid (but LP and classical are\nnot); on languages with no empty names but resources for paradox, LP\nis valid (but K3 and classical are not); and on the richest languages\nwith both empty names and the resources for paradox, FDE (but not LP,\nK3 or classical) is valid. Here the pluralist\u2019s motivation is\nnot generous inclusiveness. Rather, they have been driven to their\npluralism by the deviant monists\u2019 arguments and by the desire to\navoid being stuck with a logic that is too weak to be useful.\n\nWhat should this logical pluralist say about the metalogic?\nAbsent new reasons to adopt a weaker logic, they can at least allow\nthe use of FDE, but even given their fairly modest pluralism, this\nleaves them with rather a weak logic. There would be no modus ponens\nor law of excluded middle, no disjunctive syllogism or EFQ. All those\nthings can be quite useful for proving things and giving arguments. So\nit would be nice to have something stronger. \n\nAnd the natural question for this kind of pluralist to ask is: is\nthere any danger of semantic paradoxes, or of empty names, in the\nlanguage in which they are doing their metatheoretical work? If there\nare no empty names, then they would seem to be free to use LP, and if\nthere are no semantic paradoxes, then they would seem to be free to\nuse K3. And if neither, then they would seem to be all the way back to\nusing classical logic for their metatheory\u2014even though they are\na logical pluralist overall.\n\nIn the tradition that runs through Tarski\u2019s (1944)\n\u201cSemantic Conception of Truth\u201d we usually expect a\nmetalanguage to be at least as rich as its object language (and the\nmetametalanguage at least as rich as the metalanguage and so on up the\nhierarchy). Tarski\u2019s metalanguage, for example, contains all the\nexpressions from the object language, as well as names for all those\nexpressions, logical vocabulary, and a truth-predicate, all of which\nallow us to express instances of Tarski\u2019s disquotation schema,\nsuch as: \u201cSnow is white\u201d is true if and only if snow is\nwhite.\n\nIf our metalanguage continued that Tarskian tradition, then it would\ncontain empty names if the object language contained empty names, and\nthe resources for constructing paradoxes if the object language\ncontained those (of course, Tarski\u2019s object language\ndoes not contain those resources but if our object language contained\nthem, and our metalanguage contained our object language, then our\nmetalanguage would have those resources too). But even if we assume\nthat this feature of Tarski\u2019s hierarchy holds\ngenerally\u2014that is, that every metalanguage is at least as\nexpressive as its object language\u2014it might be that the part of\nthe metalanguage we require for a certain proof, or a certain argument\nrequires only a fragment (a sublanguage, as it were) of the\nmetalanguage, and this sublanguage might not contain empty names or\nparadoxical sentences. We can formulate a language for talking about a\nlanguage which contains empty names, where the (meta)language names\nall refer. For instance, all the terms in the metalanguage might be\nquotation names for expressions in the object language, and hence the\nmetalanguage would have no empty names itself. Or the object language\nmight have truth-predicates which apply to its own expressions, though\nthe part of the metalanguage that we need for showing that this\nresults in counterexamples to EFQ does not.\n\nFor this kind of pluralist, it is quite natural for the logic of the\nobject language and the logic of the metalanguage to come apart in a\nprincipled way. It is also quite natural for them to maintain that\nthey in fact continue to be a pluralist at the level of the\nmetalanguage. For what is the logic of the metalanguage? Well, for the\nfragment of the language that contains no empty names and insufficient\nresources for paradox, it\u2019s classical logic. And for the\nfragment that contains empty names but no resources for paradox it is\nK3. And for the fragment that contains resources for paradox without\nempty names, it is LP. And for the metalanguage as a whole it is FDE.\nPluralism about the logic of the object language, and pluralism about\nthe metalogic as well.\n3. Logical Nihilism\n\nThe pluralist\u2019s response to the generality objection has\ngenerated interest in a related view: logical nihilism\u2014the view\nthat there is no correct logic (Russell 2017, 2018a,b; Cotnoir 2018;\nsee also predecessors in Estrada-Gonz\u00e1les 2012 and Mortensen\n1989). Nihilism fits naturally into the spectrum that includes monism\n(exactly one correct logic) and pluralism (more than one correct\nlogic). As with monism and pluralism, what nihilism amounts to will\ndepend on what counts as a logic, and what it takes for one to be\ncorrect.\n\nOn the version most relevant here, the nihilist holds that the set of\ncorrect logical principles of the form \\(\\Gamma \\vDash A\\) is empty,\nso that there are no laws of logic (see Russell [2018a: 309\u201311]\nfor a nihilism-focused discussion of the form taken by laws of logic).\n\n\nIn the next subsection, we will look at one argument for logical\nnihilism, but before doing that, we should address the fact that many\npeople\u2019s initial reaction to nihilism is that there is no point\nin considering arguments for it, because the view is manifestly\nabsurd, or because it is somehow self-defeating.\n\nPeople sometimes think that nihilism is absurd because it appears to\nconflict with obvious truths about logic, things that students learn\nwhen they are first introduced to the subject. For example, it might\nbe suggested that the following simple argument is just obviously\ntruth-preserving and hence any view on which this is not the case is\nnot worth further consideration: \n\n\nIf snow is white, then grass is green. \n\nSnow is white. \n\nGrass is green. \n\n\nBut it\u2019s important to realise that the nihilist has no need to\nreject this simple instance of modus ponens. Their view is\nthat modus ponens is not a law of logic, which would require that\nevery instance of the argument form modus ponens is\ntruth-preserving. That\u2019s a much stronger and more general claim.\nLike other proponents of weaker logics, the nihilist can reject the\nvalidity of a putative law based on some quite rare and unusual cases,\nand then\u2014following the intuitionists and dialetheists discussed\nin the section on breaking metalogical harmony above\u2014engage in a\nproject of strength recapture that allows them to employ the\nprinciples of a stronger logic in circumstances where the esoteric\ncounterexamples don\u2019t threaten. The nihilist thinks that\narguments needn\u2019t be logically valid to be good\u2014in part\nbecause the requirement of logical validity is so strong.\n\nA second reason people sometimes think that nihilism deserves no\nfurther thought is that they regard it as self-defeating. After all,\npeople sometimes say, if the nihilist were right, there would be no\ngood arguments. Nihilism therefore undermines any argument for itself,\nand so there is no need to consider arguments for it.\n\nBut, as we have already seen, a nihilist needn\u2019t think that\nthere are no good arguments, only that there are no logically\nvalid arguments. This leaves open three kinds of argument that a\nnihilist can employ. First, an argument might be useful merely because\nit is valid according to their opponents; that at least permits an\nargument for nihilism that the opponents should accept by their own\nlights. Second, there can be good arguments which don\u2019t even\npretend to be logically valid; perhaps they employ inference to the\nbest explanation instead. Anti-exceptionalists, for example, often\nexpect the correct logic to be justified abductively, and so would not\nexpect the argument for the correct logic to be a logically valid one\n(Hjortland 2017). And third\u2014and most crucially for understanding\nthe nihilist\u2019s position\u2014the argument form employed might\nbe not be truth-preserving over all cases (and so not logically valid)\nbut still be truth-preserving in the case under consideration.\n\nWith these preliminaries out of the way, we examine one argument for\nlogical nihilism.\n3.1 Logical Nihilism via the Generality Objection\n\nThe pluralist, as we explained in\n \u00a72.1.1,\n can use a reductio to respond to the Generality Objection:\nif we insist (with the monist) that complete generality is a\nconstraint on being a logical law, then it will turn out that there\nare no logical laws, and that\u2014the argument assumes\u2014is\nabsurd. So we should reject complete generality. But the nihilist\nthinks this is too fast. Why couldn\u2019t nihilism be true? Then the\npluralist\u2019s reductio could be repurposed as a positive\nargument for the view: \n\n(P1)\nA principle of the form \\(\\Gamma \\vDash A\\) is logically valid iff\n\\(A\\) is true in all cases in which each \\(\\gamma \\in \\Gamma\\) is\ntrue.\n(P2)\nEvery principle of the form \\(\\Gamma \\vDash A\\)\nis such that there are some cases where \\(A\\) is not true but each\n\\(\\gamma \\in \\Gamma\\) is true.\n(C)\nNo principle of the form \\(\\Gamma \\vDash A\\) is logically\nvalid.\n\n\nThis naturally draws attention to P2. Why think that all putative\nlogical laws fail in some cases? The pluralist didn\u2019t need to\nworry too much about P2. As we saw in section\n \u00a72.1.1,\n their embrace of multiple rival logics tends to lead to a view on\nwhich counterexamples to logical principles are relatively common and\nso the insistence on P1 leads quickly to either logical nihilism, or\nat least a logic that is too weak to be the One True Logic (what we\nmight call logical minimalism). In fact, it\u2019s common\nfor pluralists rehearsing the argument to first suggest it leads to\nnihilism as a sort of rhetorical hyperbole, and then back off to a\nlogic that is merely unappealingly weak: perhaps the only law is\nidentity, \n\n(ID)\n \\(A \\vDash A\\)\n\n\nFor a pluralist employing the argument as a reductio, it\ndoesn\u2019t really matter whether P2 is true, or only very nearly\ntrue; either is sufficiently absurd or unattractive (on their view)\nfor the reductio to function.\n\nBut if we want to argue that nihilism is literally true, we need to\nargue for the truth of P2. So why think that for any set of premises,\n\u0393, and conclusion, A, there is always some case in which the\npremises are true but the conclusion is not?\n\nOne argument notes that we can think of cases as interpretations for\nthe non-logical expressions of the language, and that the ones\npermitted by classical logic are quite constraining and idealised:\nthere are no empty names, indeterminate or overdeterminate predicates,\nsentences that take multiple or no truth-values, or ways to model\ncontext-sensitive expressions. Natural language might be thought to\ncontain expressions which have all these different kinds of\ninterpretation, so that some arguments expressible in natural language\nare not well modelled by classical logic. Once we start enriching\nlogical languages to include these \u201cnon-ideal\u201d kinds of\nexpression, the logic has a tendency to weaken (though the details\ndepend on one\u2019s substantive philosophical views).\n\nTo take a few examples, some people think that natural languages\ncontain empty names, that sentences with empty names are neither\ntrue nor false, that the truth-values of complex sentences\ncontaining subsentences which are neither true nor false are\ndetermined according to the Strong Kleene tables, and as a result that\nno form is true on every interpretation: atomic sentences, like \\(Fa\\)\nare always neither when the term is interpreted as empty, and\nany compound sentence constructed from such an atomic sentence\n(including \\(Fa \\lor \\neg Fa\\)) is neither too. Hence there\nare interpretations on which the law of excluded middle (LEM: \\(A\\lor\n\\neg A\\)) fails to be true (because it is neither) and so LEM\nis not logically valid. On some views vagueness and future-contingents\ncan also give rise to sentences that don\u2019t have one of the\nclassical truth-values. Some hold that the universality of natural\nlanguages allows the expression of sentences (like the Liar) that are\nboth truth and false, and from here we can implement the truth-table\nfor LP (taking true and both as designated values) to get a logic in\nwhich EFQ, modus ponens, and disjunctive syllogism all fail. Still, it\ncan be hard to see on these familiar grounds alone how some of the\nsafest logical laws, things like \u2227-introduction or ID, fail:\n\n\\[\n\\begin{array}{c}\nA\\\\\nB\\\\ \\hline\nA\\land B\\\\\n\\end{array}\n\\]\n \n\\[\n\\begin{array}{c}\nA\\\\\\hline\nA\\\\\n\\end{array}\n\\]\n\n\nOne move the nihilist can make here is to exploit context-sensitive\nexpressions whose extension varies with syntactic context\n(see Russell (2017; 2018a) for a more formal presentation). If we have\na sentence SOLO which is true any time it appears as an\natomic sentence but false when embedded in more complex constructions,\nthen the following instance of \u2227-introduction will take us from\ntrue premises to a false conclusion: \n\\[\n\\begin{array}{l}\n\\textit{SOLO}\\\\\nB\\\\ \\hline\n\\textit{SOLO} \\land B\\\\\n\\end{array}\n\\]\n\n\nSimilarly, if we have an atomic sentence PREM whose\ntruth-value is true when it features in the premises of an\nargument, but false when it appears in the conclusion, then\nthe following instance of ID will take us from a true premise to a\nconclusion which is not true:  \n\\[\n\\begin{array}{c}\n\\textit{PREM}\\\\ \\hline\n\\textit{PREM}\\\\\n\\end{array}\n\\]\n\n\nThe nihilist argues that once we have seen \u2227-introduction and ID\nfall to these kinds of non-standard interpretation, it is plausible\nthat no entailment will hold quite generally.\n3.2 Responses to Logical Nihilism\n\nDespite its recent provenance, there are already several interesting\nresponses to logical nihilism. Dicher (2021) raises the question of\nwhether PREM and SOLO should be treated as logical\nconstants, rather than as non-logical expressions. He points out that\nif they were, their inclusion in a language would instead give us new\nkinds of valid argument, such as: \n\\[\n\\begin{array}{c}\nA\\\\ \\hline\n\\neg \\textit{PREM}\\\\\n\\end{array}\n\\]\n\n\nor \n\\[\n\\begin{array}{c}\n\\textit{SOLO}\\\\ \\hline\n\\neg \\textit{SOLO}\\\\\n\\end{array}\n\\]\n\n\n(See also Russell (2018a: fn. 15) for related discussion of \\(\\top\\),\n\\(\\perp\\) and logical minimalism.) Fjellstad (2021) argues that\nPREM can have a place in non-nihilist logics. Haze (2022)\nargues that the counterexamples using PREM and SOLO\ncommit a version of the fallacy of equivocation and hence are not\nreally instances of ID and \u2227-introduction respectively. And N.\nWyatt and Payette (2021) reject P1 of the argument from generality in\norder to endorse a view they call logical particularism (see\nalso Payette and Wyatt (2018) as well as the last section of Russell\n(2018a), which proposes a constraint on logical generality based on\nLakatos\u2019s idea of lemma incorporation).\n4. Logical Pluralism via Linguistic Pluralism\n\nThe contemporary debate over case-based logical pluralism has lead to\na revival of interest in an older form of pluralism advocated by the\nfamous logical positivist, Rudolf Carnap (1937: \u00a717; 1950 [1958];\nsee also Restall 2002; Cook 2010; Field 2009; Kouri Kissel 2019; Varzi\n2002; Eklund 2012).\n4.1 The Principle of Tolerance\n\nIn \u00a717 of The Logical Syntax of Language, Carnap\nwrites:\n\n\nIn logic there are no morals. Everyone is at liberty to build his own\nlogic, i.e. his own language, as he wishes. All that is required of\nhim is that, if he wishes to discuss it, he must state his methods\nclearly, and give syntactical rules instead of philosophical\narguments. (Carnap 1937: \u00a717)\n\n\nTwo kinds of tolerance are expressed in this passage. The more famous\nis Carnap\u2019s tolerance for different languages, and it is\nmotivated both by the thought that verbal disputes are not really\ntheoretical disputes about the domain we are describing. At best they\nare practical disputes about the most useful and efficient ways to use\nwords, given our goals, and by the thought that such practical matters\nare best left to those working in the relevant field. As Carnap wrote\nlater,\n\n\nLet us grant to those who work in any special fields of investigation\nthe freedom to use any form of expression which seems useful to them.\nThe work in the field will sooner or later lead to the elimination of\nthose forms which have no useful function. Let us be cautious in\nmaking assertions and critical in examining them, but tolerant in\npermitting linguistic forms. (Carnap 1950 [1958: 221], emphasis\nin original)\n\n\nThe second kind of tolerance is a tolerance for different\nlogics, something that is naturally construed as a kind of\nlogical pluralism. The phrase \u201ceveryone is at liberty to build\nhis own logic\u201d suggests that no-one would be making a mistake in\nso doing. And it seems clear from the phrase that immediately\nfollows\u2014\u201ci.e., his own language\u201d\u2014that Carnap\ntakes the two kinds of toleration to be extremely close, perhaps he\neven thinks that linguistic tolerance and logical tolerance amount to\nthe same thing.\n\nIt might not be obvious to a modern reader why that is the case. Why\ncould we not be tolerant of alternative languages, which seems only\nsensible, without thereby committing ourselves to being tolerant of\nalternative logics? Moreover, logicians who disagree about which\nsentential logic is correct (e.g., classical or intuitionist) seem to\nbe able to use the same language (containing \u2227, \u2192, \u00ac,\netc.) even while they suppose that one logic is right for that\nlanguage, and one logic wrong. If that position is coherent, then one\nside must have made a mistake after all, implying they were not really\n\u201cat liberty to build their own logic\u201d.\n\nThat view seems at least an open possibility, though whether two rival\nlogicians are really advocating different logics for the same language\ncan be difficult to determine. It will not be sufficient that they are\nusing the same symbols, since they might each be using the symbols\nwith different meanings in which case they will be using different\nlanguages. But what more, beyond using the same expressions, is\nrequired?\n\nThis is a question to which there are many rival answers, even for the\nmost basic logical constants. Perhaps the expressions must denote the\nsame truth-function, or have the same intension, or share a mode of\npresentation, or a character, or a conceptual role. But The\nLogical Syntax of Language was published (in German) in 1934,\nbefore the innovations of Grice, Gentzen, Montague, Kaplan, Lewis,\nPutnam or Kripke, (and, moreover before Tarski\u2019s (1936 [1956])\n\u201cOn the Concept of Logical Consequence\u201d (Schurz 1999)) and\nin an environment in which Wittgenstein\u2019s Tractatus\nLogico-Philosophicus was a powerful influence. Carnap has quite\ndefinite and explicit ideas about both meaning and logic, and these\nhelp to explain why he thinks linguistic tolerance leads straight to\nlogical tolerance. In the foreword to The Logical Syntax of\nLanguage he writes:\n\n\nUp to now, in constructing a language, the procedure has usually been,\nfirst to assign a meaning to the fundamental mathematico-logical\nsymbols, and then to consider what sentences and inferences are seen\nto be logically correct in accordance with this meaning. Since the\nassignment of the meaning is expressed in words, and is, in\nconsequence, inexact, no conclusion arrived at in this way can very\nwell be otherwise than inexact and ambiguous. The connection will only\nbecome clear when approached from the opposite direction: let any\npostulates and any rules of inference be chosen arbitrarily; then this\nchoice, whatever it may be, will determine what meaning is to be\nassigned to the fundamental logical symbols. (Carnap 1937: xv)\n\n\nAccording to Carnap then, the right way to specify a language is to\npick some expressions, and then give the rules of inference for them.\nIt is this specification which gives the expressions their meanings,\nand so, first, there is no question of their being the wrong rules for\nthe expressions\u2014everybody is at liberty to build his own logic,\nto choose whatever rules he likes\u2014and second, to be tolerant\nabout language choice is already to be tolerant about choice of\nlogic\u2014for languages so-conceived come with different logics\nalready \u201cbuilt in\u201d.\n\nOne of Carnap\u2019s reasons for accepting logical pluralism is that\nhe saw it as making space for innovation in logic. In the foreword to\nThe Logical Syntax of Language he writes:\n\n\nUp to the present, there has been only a very slight deviation, in a\nfew points here and there, from the form of language developed by\nRussell which has already become classical. For instance, certain\nsentential forms (such as unlimited existential sentences) and rules\nof inference (such as the law of excluded middle), have been\neliminated by certain authors. On the other hand, a number of\nextensions have been attempted, and several interesting, many-valued\ncalculi analogous to the two-valued calculus of sentences have been\nevolved, and have resulted finally in a logic of probability.\nLikewise, so-called intensional sentences have been introduced and,\nwith their aid a logic of modality developed. The fact that no\nattempts have been made to venture still further from the classical\nforms is perhaps due to the widely held opinion that any such\ndeviations must be justified\u2014that is, the new language-form must\nbe proved to be \u201ccorrect\u201d and to constitute a faithful\nrendering of \u201cthe true logic\u201d.\n\nTo eliminate this standpoint, together with the pseudo-problems and\nwearisome controversies with arise as a result of it, is one of the\nchief tasks of this book. (Carnap 1937: xiv\u2013xv)\n\n\nThis passage highlights several features of Carnap\u2019s logical\npluralism and philosophy of logic more generally. It seems clear that\nhe intended his logical pluralism to be both\n\u201chorizontal\u201d\u2014that is, to allow for different logics\nat the same level, such as classical and intuitionist sentential\nlogics\u2014as well as \u201cvertical\u201d\u2014allowing for\nlogics for new kinds of expression, such as intensional logics and\nsecond-order logic (the terminology is from Eklund 2012). Furthermore\nthe passage expresses a \u201clogic-first\u201d approach, and\nrejects a \u201cphilosophy-first\u201d approach, suggesting that\nrather than trying to figure out which is the best logic a\npriori from first principles (the \u201cphilosophy-first\u201d\napproach), we should let logicians develop languages as they like, and\nthen make our judgements based on how things turn out.\n\nThe most obvious contrast here is with W. V. O. Quine, who criticised\nsecond-order logic as \u201cset-theory in sheep\u2019s\nclothing\u201d and rejected tense and modal logics on philosophical\ngrounds (Quine 1986: ch. 5; 1953a; 1953b [1966]; Burgess 1997; 2009).\nSuch a stand-off is quite intriguing, given Quine\u2019s rejection of\nsuch \u201cphilosophy-first\u201d approaches in epistemology more\ngenerally.\n4.2 Issues for Carnap\u2019s Pluralism\n\nA number of contemporary writers have been happy to endorse\nCarnap\u2019s approach to pluralism (see, e.g., Varzi 2002: 199), and\nRestall argues that it is less radical than his and JC Beall\u2019s\ncase-based version (Restall 2002). Nonetheless there are several\nissues that someone who wanted to defend Carnap\u2019s position today\nwould need to address. A first concern about the view is that while we\nare working within the various languages we invent, we could be\nmissing the \u201ccorrect\u201d rules\u2014the ones that were out\nthere, in effect, before we invented anything. In the words of Paul\nBoghossian,\n\n\nAre we really to suppose that, prior to our stipulating a meaning for\nthe sentence \u201cEither snow is white or it isn\u2019t\u201d\nit wasn\u2019t the case that either snow was white or it\nwasn\u2019t? Isn\u2019t it overwhelmingly obvious that this\nclaim was true before such an act of meaning, and that it\nwould have been true even if no one had thought about it, or chosen it\nto be expressed by one of our sentences? (Boghossian 1996: 365,\nemphasis in original)\n\n\nCarnap would perhaps not have taken this objection seriously, since,\nlike the Wittgenstein of the Tractatus (e.g.,\n\u00a7\u00a74.26, 4.461\u20134.465), he does not believe that logical\ntruths and rules are \u201cout there\u201d, waiting to be\ndiscovered:\n\n\nThe so-called \u201creal\u201d sentences, constitute the core of the\nscience; the mathematico-logical sentences are analytic, with no real\ncontent, and are merely formal auxiliaries. (Carnap 1937: xiv)\n\n\nNonetheless, such a \u201cconventionalist\u201d view of logical\ntruth (and along with it, analytic truth) has been argued against by,\nfor example, Quine, Yablo, Boghossian, and Sober, and it no longer\nenjoys the popularity that it had in Carnap\u2019s time (Quine 1936;\nYablo 1992; Boghossian 1996; Sober 2000). It also highlights the\nextent to which it is odd to call Carnap a logical pluralist, since in\na way his view is not that there is more than one correct logic, but\nthat there is nothing for logic to be correct about (Cook 2010: 498).\nPerhaps it would be more illuminating to call Carnap a logical\nconstructivist.\n\nAnother issue is whether Carnap\u2019s conception of meaning is\ncorrect. These days there are many alternative approaches to meaning\nand lively debate about them. Field writes:\n\n\nOn some readings of \u201cdiffer in meaning\u201d, any big\ndifference in theory generates a difference in meaning. On such\nreadings, the connectives do indeed differ in meaning between\nadvocates of the different all-purpose logics, just as\n\u201celectron\u201d differs in meaning between Thomson\u2019s\ntheory and Rutherford\u2019s; but Rutherford\u2019s theory disagrees\nwith Thomson\u2019s despite this difference in meaning, and it is\nunclear why we shouldn\u2019t say the same thing about alternative\nall-purpose logics. (Field 2009: 345)\n\n\nField concludes that \u201cthe notion of difference of meaning is\nunhelpful in the context\u201d and that Carnap\u2019s view of the\nmeanings of the logical contexts is therefore hard to defend.\n\nBut proponents of particular alternative views about the meanings of\nthe logical constants might instead hold that they can make good sense\nof difference in meaning in these contexts, and that Carnap has simply\nendorsed the wrong theory of meaning and as a result drawn the wrong\nconclusions for logic. One specific issue that they might point to is\nassociated with Prior\u2019s 1960 paper \u201cThe Runabout Inference\nTicket\u201d, in which he provides rules for a new connective,\ntonk. The connective quickly leads to triviality, suggesting\nthat Prior was not quite \u201cat liberty to build his own\nlogic\u201d by introducing rules for his expressions.\n\nAnother issue is the fact that one can generate different logics, not\nby varying the rules governing any particular expression, but rather\nby varying the more general structural rules of the logic, which\ngovern things like whether or not one is allowed multiple conclusions,\nand whether or not a premise can be used more than once in a proof\n(Restall 2000; Paoli 2003). This suggests that even if the meanings of\nthe logical expressions are governed by the rules that tell you how\nthey can be used in proofs (as Carnap suggests) two logics can agree\non those rules, whilst disagreeing on the relation of logical\nconsequence. Hence even if you have successfully chosen a language, it\nseems that you might not yet have determined a logic.\n5. Further Kinds of Logical Pluralism\n\nSeveral other varieties of logical pluralism have been proposed since\nBeall and Restall\u2019s early work, and five are outlined in this\nsection. A useful way to classify these different\nviews\u2014including Beall and Restall\u2019s case-based\npluralism\u2014is as each taking logical consequence to be\nrelative to a different feature\u2014e.g., precisifications\nof \u201ccase\u201d (for Beall and Restall), sets of logical\nconstants (for Varzi), kinds of truth-bearer (for Russell), goals (for\nCook\u2019s less radical approach), and epistemic norms (for Field\u2019s).[6]\n\nOccasionally it is objected that one or more of these views does not\nconstitute a \u201creal\u201d logical pluralism, on the grounds that\nit merely relativises consequence to some new parameter, and (the\nobjection continues) this would make the view a form of relativism,\nrather than a form of\n pluralism.[7]\n We take up the question of what makes for a \u201creal\u201d or\nsubstantive logical pluralism in more fully in\n \u00a76.\n But it is worth remembering that not just some but most of\nthe views standardly discussed under the heading of logical\npluralism\u2014including the most central case-based\nversions\u2014can be understood as relativising logical consequence\nto something distinctive. They are standardly described as logical\npluralisms anyway, presumably because they are views on which it can\nreasonably be claimed that more than one logic is correct. The\nliterature is thus easier to follow if one doesn\u2019t assume that\nthe words \u201cpluralism\u201d and \u201crelativism\u201d mark an\nimportant or widely agreed-upon distinction (S. Shapiro 2014: 1).\n5.1 Pluralism Regarding the Set of Logical Constants\n\nAchille Varzi (2002) points out that one way to generate competing\nrelations of logical consequence is to vary the set of expressions\nthat we treat as logical constants. If we take \u201c=\u201d to be a\nlogical constant, then the following argument will be valid:\n\n\\[\n\\begin{array}{l}\nFa\\\\\na=b\\\\ \\hline\nFb\\\\\n\\end{array}\n\\]\n\n\nBut if the set of logical constants does not include \u201c=\u201d\nthen it will not be valid, since our models will now include those\nthat assign non-reflexive relations to \u201c=\u201d, and these can\ngenerate counter-examples.\n\nShould \u201c=\u201d be treated as a logical constant? Tarski\nhimself endorsed the view that any expression in the language\nmight be taken to be logical:\n\n\nThe division of all terms of the language discussed into logical and\nextra-logical\u2026 is certainly not quite arbitrary. If, for\nexample, we were to include among the extra-logical signs the\nimplication sign, or the universal quantifier, then our definition of\nthe concept of consequence would lead to results which obviously\ncontradict ordinary usage. On the other hand no objective grounds are\nknown to me which permit us to draw a sharp boundary between the two\ngroups of terms. It seems to me possible to include among the logical\nterms some which are usually regarded by logicians as extra-logical\nwithout running into consequences which stand in sharp contrast to\nordinary usage\u2026 In the extreme case we could regard all terms\nof the language as logical. (Tarski 1936 [1956: 418\u2013419])\n\n\nVarzi is inclined to endorse Tarski\u2019s liberalism with respect to\nthe choice of logical constants:\n\n\nThe relevant claim is that all (or any) terms of the language could in\nprinciple be regarded \u201cas logical\u201d\u2014and I agree with\nthat. (Varzi 2002: 200)\n\n\nThe result is that on his view there is more than one correct relation\nof logical consequence, since that relation is relative to the choice\nof logical constants, and there is more than one equally correct set\nof these, resulting in different, equally correct logics.\n\nThe Tarksi/Varzi view is controversial. Varzi defends it in his paper\nof 2002 and there is useful discussion in the entry on\n logical constants.\n5.2 Pluralism About the Objects of Logical Consequence\n\nAnother variety of logical pluralism results if we consider that there\nmight be different correct logics for different kinds of truth-bearer,\nas is argued in Russell (2008). Suppose that logical consequence is\nindeed a matter of truth-preservation over cases. Then we could\ncoherently talk of truth-preservation relations on (sets of)\nsentences, on (sets of) propositions, or on (sets of) characters (as\nin Kaplan 1989), and ultimately on any truth-bearer whatsoever. This\nwould not be very exciting if those logics all turned out to determine\na single \u201cparallel\u201d consequence relation, so that, for\nexample, a sentence, \\(S_1\\), had a sentence, \\(S_{2}\\), as a logical\nconsequence if and only if the proposition \\(S_1\\) expressed (namely,\n\\(P_{1}\\)) had the proposition expressed by \\(S_{2}\\) (namely,\n\\(P_{2}\\)) as a logical consequence. Russell uses various examples\ninvolving names, rigidity, direct reference, and indexicals to argue\nthat this is not always the case. To take just one, on the assumption\nthat the sentence \\(a=b\\) contains two different, directly referential\nnames, \\(a=b\\) and \\(a=a\\) express the same proposition. Given the\nminimal assumption that the relation of logical consequence is\nreflexive, that means that proposition expressed by \\(a=b\\) is a\nlogical consequence of the proposition expressed by \\(a=a\\), even\nthough the sentence \\(a=b\\) is not a logical consequence of the\nsentence \\(a = a\\). Hence the relation of logical consequence on\nsentences is interestingly different from that of the relation of\nlogical consequence on propositions, and there are at least two\ndifferent, correct relations of logical consequence.\n5.3 Pluralism about Modelling\n\nShapiro and Cook have suggested that the job of a formal logic is to\nmodel a natural language (S. Shapiro 2006, 2014; Cook 2010). Since\nmodels are simplified structures intended to exhibit some but not all\nof the features of the phenomenon being modelled, there may be several\nrival models of the same language, each capturing different aspects of\nthat language. As Shapiro writes:\n\n\n\u2026with mathematical models generally, there is typically no\nquestion of \u201cgetting it exactly right\u201d. For a given\npurpose, there may be bad models\u2014models that are clearly\nincorrect\u2014and there may be good models, but it is\nunlikely that one can speak of one and only one correct model. (S.\nShapiro 2006: 49\u201350, emphasis in original)\n\n\nThis sounds like it might support a species of logical\nnihilism\u2014a view on which there is no correct logic (see\n \u00a73)\u2014but\n Cook prefers to think of it as offering two different kinds of\npluralism. The first, less controversial, kind holds that which logic\nis the correct one is relative to one\u2019s goal. If one wants to\nstudy vagueness, the correct logic might be one that allows for\nintermediate truth-values, whereas if one wants to study identity,\nperhaps first-order classical logic with identity is to be preferred.\nSince the correct model is goal-relative, so is the correct logic.\n\nBut Cook wonders whether his and Shapiro\u2019s logic-as-modelling\nview could also support a more radical pluralism, since it seems\npossible that even relative to a specific purpose, there could be two\nrival logics, each clearly better than all the rest relative to that\npurpose, yet neither of which is better than the other. Under such\ncircumstances Cook thinks we might want to say that both are correct,\nand hence that there is more than one correct logic. However one could\nalso hold that in such circumstances there are two equally good\nlogics, neither of which counts as correct.\n5.4 Pluralism about Epistemic Normativity\n\nHartry Field proposes another kind of logical pluralism (Field 2009).\nThe view rests on the thesis that logic is normative (see\n \u00a72.2)\n along with a pluralism about epistemic normativity. Field holds that\nthere are many possible epistemic norms, and that we might think of\nagents as endorsing one, or\u2014more likely\u2014different norms at\ndifferent times, and as having views about how good different possible\nepistemic norms are. We use these epistemic norms to evaluate\nthemselves, and other norms (think of using numerical induction to\nevaluate both induction and counter-induction). Some norms do well by\ntheir own lights, in which case we feel no tension. Some do badly even\nby their own lights, in which case we feel pressure to change them.\nThere\u2019s no sense, on Field\u2019s view, in regarding any of\nthese norms as correct or incorrect, but he does think that it makes\nsense to call them better or worse, so long as we recognize that these\nevaluations are relative to our epistemic goals. Still, though this\nmakes norms criticizable and evaluable, it doesn\u2019t mean that\nthere will be a uniquely best norm. \n\n\nFor instance, there might be a sequence of better and better norms for\nachieving the goals; in addition, there might be ties and/or\nincomparabilities \u201carbitrarily far up\u201d. (Field 2009: 355)\n\n\n\nHence we have an epistemic normative pluralism.\n\nSimilarly, we can use our epistemic norms\u2014including deductive\nlogics\u2014to evaluate how well various deductive logics perform in\nachieving epistemic goals we have, e.g., resolving the semantic\nparadoxes. And again \n\n\n\u2026it isn\u2019t obvious that there need be a uniquely best\nlogic for a given goal, much less that we should think of one logic as\n\u201cuniquely correct\u201d in some goal independent sense. (Field\n2009: 356) \n\n\nThe result then, is a kind of logical pluralism: logics are better or\nworse relative to different goals, but even relative to a\nparticular goal, it might be that no single logic is the unique\nbest one.\n5.5 Pluralism by Restriction\n\nFinally, Hjortland explores another kind of logical pluralism in\ndefending sub-classical logics from Williamson\u2019s abductive\nargument that classical logic is the One True Logic (Hjortland 2017:\n652\u2013657; Williamson 2017; see Blake-Turner 2020 and L. Shapiro\n2022 for discussion). Consider the claim that the ubiquitous use of\nclassical logic (rather than other weaker logics) in\nmathematics is a strong point in its favour. If we had to give up\nclassical logic, we might be worried about losing a lot of elegant,\nsimple and otherwise virtuous mathematical theories. But preserving\nvirtuous theories, and letting go of ad hoc and otherwise\nvicious theories, is what the abductive approach in logic is all\nabout.\n\nHowever, the move from the importance of classical logic in\nmathematics to the truth of classical logic is much too fast. It is\none thing to say that classical logic, including say, instances of the\nprinciples of Double Negation Elimination (DNE) and Disjunctive\nSyllogism (DS), are widely used in mathematics. But mathematics does\nnot require any principles with the full strength and generality of\nclassical logic\u2019s DNE and DS\u2014it only uses some of the\ninstances of those principles, the instances that employ\nmathematical language. When we say that DNE and DS are\nlogically valid we are saying that they are valid no matter\nwhat expressions we substitute for the non-logical expressions in\nthem\u2014including extra-mathematical vague predicates like\n\u201cheap\u201d or \u201cred\u201d, and notoriously troublesome\nmetalinguistic predicates like \u201ctrue\u201d and\n\u201cheterological\u201d.\n\n\nMathematical proofs do contain an abundance of instances of classical\nprinciples: applications of classical reductio ad absurdum,\nconditional proof, disjunctive syllogism, the law of absorption, etc.\nThe emphasis, however, should be on the fact that these are instances\nof classical principles. The mathematical proofs do not rely on any of\nthese principles being unrestricted generalisations of the form that\nWilliamson defends. They do at most rely on the principles holding\nrestrictedly for mathematical discourse, which does not entail that\nthe principles of reasoning hold universally. Put differently,\nmathematical practice is consistent with these reasoning steps being\ninstances of mathematical principles of reasoning, not generalisable\nto all other discourses. A fortiori, they may very well be\nprinciples of reasoning that are permissible for mathematics, but not\nfor theorizing about truth. (Hjortland 2017: 652\u2013653) \n\n\nThat leaves space for a kind of pluralism that holds that some of the\nstronger logical principles are correct only when they are restricted\nto particular kinds of linguistic expression (such as those that\nfeature in the language of Peano Arithmetic); if we don\u2019t\nrestrict them in this way, there will be counterexamples. Other\nlogical principles (perhaps conjunction elimination is on this list)\ndo not need to be restricted to the language of Peano Arithmetic. This\nleaves us with a sense in which we have different correct logics,\ndepending on which language we are assuming.\n6. What\u2019s at Stake in the Debate about Logical Pluralism?\n\nWe\u2019ve seen that there\u2019s a vibrant debate about logical\npluralism. But there is also an undercurrent of skepticism about\nwhether the debate is worth having. Such suspicion has long been\ndeployed by monists to criticise pluralists of various kinds: if\nthat\u2019s what pluralism is, then it\u2019s true, but\nuninteresting (Goddu 2002: 222\u20136; Priest 2006: ch. 12; see also\nStei 2020a). But more recently it\u2019s been pointed out that it is\nincumbent on the monist no less than the pluralist to answer the\nquestion of what\u2019s at stake in the debate about how many logics\nare correct (Eklund 2020; Clarke-Doane manuscript\n [Other Internet Resources]).\n In this final section, we tackle some of these issues, which have\nbeen implicit in the preceding discussion.\n\nAny pluralism that relativises logics to different domains\n (\u00a75.3)\n or otherwise restricts pluralism to different areas of discourse\n (\u00a75.5)\n needs to explain how it conflicts with monism. A monist can agree\nthat, given background assumptions about a domain, it may be\nappropriate to deploy a different logic than the one they endorse. As\nwe\u2019ve seen\n (\u00a72.4.1),\n the subclassical monist allows strength recapture in the right\ndomain. For instance, a proponent of LP can allow that, when reasoning\nabout a consistent domain, one can use classical logic, rather than a\nparaconsistent logic. So what is it about domain-relative pluralism\nthat makes it different from monism? One strategy is to appeal to the\npractices of those working in the relevant domains. Stewart Shapiro\n(2014: ch. 3), for instance, derives a pluralism from the practices of\nmathematicians working in areas that deploy nonclassical logics, such\nas Smooth Infinitesimal Analysis. Shapiro\u2019s argument depends on\ncontroversial assumptions in the philosophy of mathematics, but\nperhaps it can be made independently of such commitments (Caret 2021).\nEven so, the challenge remains of defending the pluralist\u2019s\ninterpretation of the data over the monist\u2019s. Why think that\nthere really are two different correct logics rather than that for the\npurposes of, say, doing Smooth Infinitesimal Analysis, it\u2019s\nuseful to reason according to an intuitionist logic, rather than\nclassical logic?\n\nPerhaps a domain-neutral pluralism, such as Beall and Restall\u2019s\nCase-Based Logical Pluralism\n (\u00a71),\n which holds that different logics are correct of the very same\ndomain, is a more promising candidate for a substantive thesis. There\nare at least two versions of such a pluralism: semantic and\n telic.[8]\n The semantic version has it that some logical term or concept is\nunsettled, vague, or ambiguous. Let\u2019s take it to be the term\n\u201cvalid\u201d for concreteness\u2019s sake. Then the semantic\nversion of domain-neutral pluralism holds that\u2014even keeping\nfixed the domain\u2014\u201cvalid\u201d has different referents, or\nadmits of different precisifications, all of which are correct. Even\nsetting aside the worries about background commitments in philosophy\nof language canvased in\n \u00a71.1,\n the onus on the pluralist is to explain why the claim of semantic\nindeterminacy is a philosophically, rather than merely a\nlinguistically, substantive thesis. The worry is that the\nmonism-pluralism debate is about how many (and which) logics are\ncorrect, not how many are picked out by our terms. So even if\n\u201cvalid\u201d does admit of different precifisications, as Beall\nand Restall suggest, the pluralist needs further argument to get the\nconclusion that the different referents of \u201cvalid\u201d are\ncorrect logics. Otherwise the monist can object that, if\n\u201cvalid\u201d in English is indeterminate or ambiguous, so much\nthe worse for English. There is only one correct logic, even if\nspeakers of English don\u2019t always manage to pick it out. To meet\nthis objection, domain-neutral pluralists are often better understood\nas offering a telic version of pluralism (see Eklund 2020:\n440\u2013443 for discussion).\n\nThe telic version of domain-neutral pluralism consists in two claims.\nFirst, there is at least one telos or goal that a logic must\nmeet in order to be correct. Second, more than one logic meets that\ngoal or goals. The second claim might be held either because there is\na single telos and more than one logic meets it, or because\nthere is more than one goal that multiple logics meet. Field\u2019s\n(2009) pluralism about epistemic normativity\n (\u00a75.4)\n is an explicit version of telic pluralism. But even Case-Based\nLogical Pluralism, which is officially about the unsettledness of\nvarious terms, might be better interpreted as telic pluralism. This is\nin part because of the concerns of the previous paragraph, about\nimbuing semantic versions of pluralism with substantive content. But\ncase-based pluralists themselves sometimes write as if they\u2019re\nmore interested in a telic project. For instance, in responding to a\nversion of the normativity objection\n (\u00a72.2),\n Beall & Restall (2006: 94\u201397) suggest that the goal of a\ncorrect logic is to preserve epistemic entitlement or warrant.\n\nRegardless of how particular authors understand their construals of\npluralism, telic interpretations of logical pluralism seem to deliver\nphilosophically substantive and interesting theses, not least because\nmany monists agree that there is a goal that a logic must meet in\norder to be correct. (Let\u2019s suppose that there is only one such\ngoal, to keep things tractable.) Priest (2006: 196), for instance,\ntakes the goal of logic to be providing an analysis of reasoning and\nargues that only a paraconsistent logic best meets that goal. So it\nlooks like we have substantive room for disagreement: there\u2019s\nsome goal that a logic must meet to be correct; the pluralist claims\nthat more than one logic does that equally well, the monist that only\none logic best meets the goal. A problem arises if we have pluralism\nabout what it is for logic to meet a goal, however (see Clarke-Doane\nmanuscript: 17\u201319\n [Other Internet Resources],\n for a similar argument in a slightly different context). A monist who\nendorses only classical logic might agree that intuitionist logic best\nmeets\\(_I\\) the goal of logic, where meeting\\(_I\\) the goal of logic\ntakes into account considerations that motivate truth-value gaps. But\nthe classical monist might nonetheless insist that the correct logic\nmust meet the goal of logic in some other sense.\n\nSo the challenge is to articulate the monism-pluralism debate in a way\nthat is substantive. There are several ways this might be done.\nPerhaps, after getting clearer about what it takes to meet the goal of\nlogic, the telic pluralist and the monist will find some common ground\nfrom which to conduct their debate. Or perhaps we can interpret\ndisagreements between pluralists and monists as involving\nmetalinguistic negotiation. Very roughly, a disagreement involves\nmetalinguistic negotiation if it is conducted at a first-order level,\nbut is best interpreted metalinguistically (Plunkett & Sundell\n2013). For instance, a disagreement about whether there is more than\none correct logic might best be interpreted about how we should use\nsome of the terms in the disagreement, such as \u201cvalid\u201d.\nKouri Kissel (2021) deploys this strategy to argue that\ndomain-relative pluralism can allow for substantive disagreement\nacross domains. Perhaps the broader debate about logical pluralism can\nalso be understood in this way.\n\nA final word on monism. One might think that the monist can avoid\nthese vexed issues about what it is for a logic to be correct by just\ndenying pluralism and claiming that it is not the case that\nthere is more than one correct logic.\n\nBut this won\u2019t do, for two reasons. First, the monist will need\nto say which logic is correct. That will involve similar\nissues to those raised above. If the claim that a certain logic is\ncorrect is given a semantic interpretation, then the philosophical\nupshot of that needs drawing out. If the monist\u2019s claim is given\na telic interpretation, then there will need to be careful\narticulation of, and agreement about, both what the goal of logic is\nand also of what it would be for a logic to best meet that goal.\n\nSecond, denying that there is more than one correct logic is\ncompatible with both logical monism (there is one and only one correct\nlogic) and logical nihilism (there are no correct\n logics).[9]\n In order to be distinguished from nihilism, monism needs to be\ninterpreted in a way that is philosophically substantive. That will\nrequire the monist to say what it is for a logic to be correct in a\nway that the nihilist will disagree with. For instance, the nihilist\nmight grant that some logic is best suited for a given purpose, like\nanalysing certain kinds of electrical circuit, but deny that that\nsuffices for the logic\u2019s being correct. Or the nihilist\nmight allow strength recapture under certain conditions\n (\u00a72.4.1).\n One option available to the monist is to interpret the claim that\nthere is one and only one correct logic noncognitively. Clarke-Doane\n(manuscript\n [Other Internet Resources]),\n after finding no satisfying factualist construal of monism,\ninterprets the claim as expressing an attitude. Perhaps this strategy\ncould be extended to the debate between monists and pluralists more\nbroadly.\n\nTo sum up this section, it\u2019s surprisingly difficult to interpret\nlogical pluralism in a way that is clearly philosophically\nsubstantive. That does not mean the debate about logical pluralism is\nfruitless, not least because it is similarly difficult to interpret\nmonism in a philosophically substantive way. Thus monists and\npluralists alike would do well to be clearer both about their views\nand the philosophical import of them. But the debate about logical\npluralism is also worth having because it brings into relief other\nissues in the philosophy of logic. As we\u2019ve seen, these include\nissues to do with meaning, normativity, and metalogic. Furthermore, by\nasking whether there is more than one correct logic, logical pluralism\nurges us to pay closer attention to what it is for a logic to be\ncorrect, and to consider whether nonclassical logics might meet that\nstandard.",
