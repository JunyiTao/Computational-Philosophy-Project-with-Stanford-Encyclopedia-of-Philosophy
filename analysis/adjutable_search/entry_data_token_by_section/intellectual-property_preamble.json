    "main_text": "\n\nIntellectual property is generally characterized as non-physical\nproperty that is the product of original thought. Typically, rights do\nnot surround the abstract non-physical entity; rather, intellectual\nproperty rights surround the control of physical manifestations or\nexpressions of ideas. Intellectual property law protects a\ncontent-creator\u2019s interest in their ideas by assigning and\nenforcing legal rights to produce and control physical instantiations\nof those ideas.\n\nLegal protections for intellectual property have a rich history that\nstretches back to ancient Greece and before. As different legal\nsystems matured in protecting intellectual works, there was a\nrefinement of what was being protected within different areas. Over\nthe same period several strands of moral justification for\nintellectual property were offered: namely, personality-based,\nutilitarian, and Lockean. Finally, there have been numerous critics of\nintellectual property and systems of intellectual property protection.\nThis essay will discuss all of these topics, focusing on\nAnglo-American and European legal and moral conceptions of\nintellectual property.\n",
