    "main_text": "Why Evolutionary Game Theory? || The lack of a dynamical theory in the traditional theory of games\n4.3 The lack of a dynamical theory in the traditional theory of games\n\nAt the end of the first chapter of Theory of Games and Economic\nBehavior, von Neumann and Morgenstern write:\n\nWe repeat most emphatically that our theory is thoroughly static. A\ndynamic theory would unquestionably be more complete and therefore\npreferable. But there is ample evidence from other branches of science\nthat it is futile to try to build one as long as the static side is\nnot thoroughly understood. (Von Neumann and Morgenstern, 1953, p. 44)\n\n\nThe theory of evolution is a dynamical theory, and the second approach\nto evolutionary game theory sketched above explicitly models the\ndynamics present in interactions among individuals in the population.\nSince the traditional theory of games lacks an explicit treatment of\nthe dynamics of rational deliberation, evolutionary game theory can be\nseen, in part, as filling an important lacuna of traditional game\ntheory.\n\nOne may seek to capture some of the dynamics of the decision-making\nprocess in traditional game theory by modeling the game in its\nextensive form, rather than its normal form. However, for most games\nof reasonable complexity (and hence interest), the extensive form of\nthe game quickly becomes unmanageable. Moreover, even in the extensive\nform of a game, traditional game theory represents an\nindividual\u2019s strategy as a specification of what choice that\nindividual would make at each information set in the game. A selection\nof strategy, then, corresponds to a selection, prior to game play, of\nwhat that individual will do at any possible stage of the game. This\nrepresentation of strategy selection clearly presupposes hyperrational\nplayers and fails to represent the process by which one player\nobserves his opponent\u2019s behavior, learns from these\nobservations, and makes the best move in response to what he has\nlearned (as one might expect, for there is no need to model learning\nin hyperrational individuals). The inability to model the dynamical\nelement of game play in traditional game theory, and the extent to\nwhich evolutionary game theory naturally incorporates dynamical\nconsiderations, reveals an important virtue of evolutionary game\ntheory.\n",
