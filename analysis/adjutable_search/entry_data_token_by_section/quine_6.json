    "main_text": "The Analytic-Synthetic Distinction and the Argument Against Logical Empiricism || Carnap\u2019s Principle of Tolerance and Quine\u2019s Objections\n3.1 Carnap\u2019s Principle of Tolerance and Quine\u2019s Objections\n\nCarnap holds that the role of philosophy is to analyze and clarify the\nlanguage of science, and to formulate and recommend alternative\nlanguages. After 1932, he holds that there are languages which differ\nin expressive power, not merely as notational variants. The difference\nbetween intuitionistic logic and classical logic is an important\nexample here, as is the difference between the language of Newtonian\nmechanics and the language of relativistic mechanics. (Earlier, he\nsays, he had \u2018overlooked the fact that there is a multiplicity\nof possible languages\u2019, Carnap 1934, 245; cf. also 322 of the\nsame work.) Within a given language, there may be only one correct\ntheory on a given subject. But the choice of a language is in that\nrespect unlike the choice of a theory. In deciding which theory is\ncorrect, we will appeal to observations but also to the rules of the\nlanguage; no such appeal is possible when we are choosing a language,\nfor in this case it is the rules themselves that we are choosing. So\nCarnap holds that there is no one correct language. This idea\nhas become known as the Principle of Tolerance; from the 1930s on, it\nis fundamental to Carnap\u2019s view of what philosophy is and how it\ndiffers from science. (That there is such a difference is a point\nwhich Carnap never questions.) Because there is no one correct\nlanguage, it is no part of the philosopher\u2019s job to prescribe\nthis or that language, merely to analyze, to clarify, and to suggest\nalternatives.\n\nThe Principle of Tolerance requires the analytic-synthetic\ndistinction. It requires that we can, in all cases, distinguish\nbetween theoretical changes which involve a change of meaning, and\nhence, strictly speaking, a change of language, and those which do\nnot. The former kind of change involves analytic sentences, and is a\nmatter for Tolerance; the latter involves only synthetic sentences,\nand Tolerance does not apply. The use of the Principle of Tolerance\nthus presupposes a clear distinction between the analytic sentences of\nthe language and its synthetic sentences.\n\nAt least as Quine sees the matter, the use of the Principle of\nTolerance puts analytic sentences on an entirely different\nepistemological footing from synthetic sentences. Synthetic sentences\nare answerable to evidence; analytic sentences are a matter of the\nchoice of language, which does not require theoretical justification.\nQuine, however, rejects the idea that there is such an epistemological\ndifference. Even if we can distinguish the analytic sentences from the\nsynthetic sentences, we may still have reasons to reject an analytic\nsentence. And those reasons may be of the same kind that lead us to\nreject synthetic sentences. This point is hard to see if one focuses\non examples such as \u201cAll bachelors are unmarried\u201d. The\nmatter is otherwise if one considers examples such as \u201cForce\nequals mass times acceleration\u201d. (See Putnam, 1962.) A change of\nmind about an analytic sentence would be a change in the language.\nStill, we might have reasons to make such a change, reasons that are\nof the same sort that lead us to make revisions to synthetic\nsentences. In that case, we have no more reason to apply Tolerance in\nthe one kind of case than in the other.\n\nThis is the view that Quine argues for. On the one hand, he emphasizes\nthe point (which Carnap largely accepts) that choice of language is\nnot theoretically neutral: some choices will make for a better theory\nthan others. On the other hand, he argues that \u2018pragmatic\u2019\nfactors, such as simplicity, which Carnap had accepted as playing a\nrole in choice of language, also play a role in the choice of a theory\nwithin a language. Hence, he claims, the two sorts of choice are on\nthe same epistemological footing, and the Principle of Tolerance is\nunjustified.\n\nQuine\u2019s argument for this position relies on holism.\nThis is the claim that most of our sentences do not have implications\nfor experience when they are taken one-by-one, each in isolation from\nthe others. What has experiential implication is, in most cases, not\nan individual sentence but a larger chunk of theory. Holism is not a\nvery controversial doctrine. (Carnap accepts it; see Carnap, 1934,\n318.) Quine claims that holism shows that most of our sentences are\nnot justified by the relation of the individual sentence, considered\nin isolation, to experience. Almost always, what matters is the\nrelation to experience of some larger chunk of theory (in principle,\nalthough perhaps never in practice, of the theory as a whole). This\nmeans that in principle the correctness of a given claim is almost\nnever settled simply by looking at the empirical evidence for that\nclaim alone. Other factors will play a role, in particular the way in\nwhich accepting the given claim would contribute to the efficacy and\nsimplicity of the theory as a whole. But these are precisely the\n\u2018pragmatic factors\u2019 which Carnap thought played a role in\nthe choice of language. In arguing that such factors play a role\nthroughout our knowledge, Quine accepts \u2018a more thorough\npragmatism\u2019 (1951, 46) which puts Carnap\u2019s external\nchanges on the same epistemological footing as his internal changes.\n(Quine\u2019s early account of these matters is extremely sketchy.\nFor elaboration, see Quine 1991 and 1996; for criticism of the sketchy\naccount, see Sober 2000.)\n",
