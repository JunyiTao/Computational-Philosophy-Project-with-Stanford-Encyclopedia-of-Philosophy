    "main_text": "\n\nQuestions about moral character have recently come to occupy a central\nplace in philosophical discussion. Part of the explanation for this\ndevelopment can be traced to the publication in 1958 of G. E. M.\nAnscombe\u2019s seminal article \u201cModern Moral\nPhilosophy.\u201d In that paper Anscombe argued that Kantianism and\nutilitarianism, the two major traditions in western moral philosophy,\nmistakenly placed the foundation for morality in legalistic notions\nsuch as duty and obligation. To do ethics properly, Anscombe argued,\none must start with what it is for a human being to flourish or live\nwell. That meant returning to some questions that mattered deeply to\nthe ancient Greek moralists. These questions focussed on the nature of\n\u201cvirtue\u201d (or what we might think of as admirable moral\ncharacter), of how one becomes virtuous (is it taught? does it arise\nnaturally? are we responsible for its development?), and of what\nrelationships and institutions may be necessary to make becoming\nvirtuous possible. Answers to these ancient questions emerge today in\nvarious areas of philosophy, including ethics (especially virtue\nethics), feminist ethics, political philosophy, philosophy of\neducation, and philosophy of literature. Interest in virtue and\ncharacter was also indirectly the result of a more practical turn in\npolitical philosophy, inspired by the publication of John\nRawls\u2019s A Theory of Justice in 1971. Especially in Part\nIII of A Theory of Justice, Rawls provided a picture of how\nindividuals might be brought up in a just state to develop the virtues\nexpected of good citizens. Although his interest was not in moral\neducation per se, his discussion of how individuals acquire a sense of\njustice and of how they develop what he called self-respect stimulated\nother philosophers to explore the psychological foundations of virtue\nand the contributions made by friendship, family, community, and\nmeaningful work to good moral character.\n\nThis entry provides a brief historical account of some important\ndevelopments in philosophical approaches to good moral character.\nApproximately half the entry is on the Greek moralists Socrates,\nPlato, Aristotle, and the Stoics. Of these, most attention is given to\nAristotle\u2019s views, since most other philosophical discussions of\ncharacter are indebted to his analysis. The latter half of the entry\nexplores how other philosophers have responded to the concerns first\nraised by the Greeks. Some philosophers, such as Hugo Grotius and\nImmanuel Kant, represent a \u201cmodern\u201d approach to character\nthat subordinates it to other moral notions such as duty and obedience\nto law. Other philosophers, such as David Hume, Karl Marx, John Stuart\nMill, and T. H. Green take an interest in the psychology of moral\ncharacter that is more reminiscent of the Greeks. Finally, this entry\nindicates the directions taken by some contemporary philosophers in\nrecent work on or related to moral character.\n",
