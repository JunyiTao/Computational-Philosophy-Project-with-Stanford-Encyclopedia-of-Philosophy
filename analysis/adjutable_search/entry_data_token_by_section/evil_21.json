    "main_text": "Theodicies || The Freedom to Do Great Evil\n7.3 The Freedom to Do Great Evil\n The fact that agents could be free in a libertarian sense even if\nthey did not have the power to inflict great harm upon others has led\nat least one philosopher\u2014namely, Richard Swinburne\u2014to\nargue that, while free will is valuable, precisely how valuable it is\ndepends upon the range of actions open to one. Swinburne\u2019s idea is\nthat if the possible actions that are open to one vary enormously in\nmoral worth, then libertarian free will is very valuable indeed,\nwhereas if the variation in the moral status of what one can do is\nvery limited, then libertarian free will adds much less to the world:\none has what has been characterized as a \u2018toy world\u2019, where one has\nvery little responsibility for the well-being of others.\nThis variant on the appeal to libertarian free will is also open to\na number of objections. First, as with free will theodicies in\ngeneral, this line of thought provides no justification for the\nexistence of occurrences that not only appear, upon cursory\ninspection, to be natural evils, uncaused by any agents, but where, in\naddition, the very closest scientific examination supports the\nconclusion that there are no grounds for postulating anything beyond\npurely physical events as the causes of the occurrences in\nquestion.\nSecondly, if what matters is simply the existence of alternative\nactions that differ greatly in moral value, this can be the case even in a\nworld where one lacks the power to inflict great harm on others, since\nthere can be actions that, rather than inflicting great suffering on\nothers, would instead benefit others enormously, and which one could\neither perform or intentionally refrain from performing.\nThirdly, what exactly is the underlying line of thought here? In\nthe case of human actions, Swinburne surely holds that one should\nprevent someone from doing something that would be morally horrendous,\nif one can do so. Is the idea, then, that while occasional prevention\nof such evils does not significantly reduce the extent of the moral\nresponsibility of others, if one\u2019s power were to increase, a point\nwould be reached where one should sometimes refrain from preventing\npeople from performing morally horrendous actions? But why should this\nbe so? One answer might be that if one intervened too frequently,\npeople would come to believe that they did not have the ability to\nperform such actions. But, in the first place, it is not clear why\nthat would be undesirable. People could still, for example, be\nthoroughly evil, for they could still very much wish that they had the power to\nperform such terrible actions, and be disposed to perform such actions\nif they ever came to have the power. In the second place, prevention\nof deeply evil actions could take quite different forms. People could,\nfor example, be given a conscience that led them, when they had\ndecided to cause great injury to others, and were about to do so, to\nfeel that what they were about to do was too terrible a thing, so that\nthey would not carry through on the action. In such a world, people\ncould surely still feel that they themselves were capable of\nperforming heinously evil actions, and they would contemplate\nperforming such actions, but in the end their sense of the great\nwrongness of the actions would triumph over their selfish reasons for\nwanting to perform the actions in question.\n\n",
