    "main_text": "Life and Works\n1. Life and Works\n\nG\u00f3mez Pereira\u2019s biography is largely unknown. Only a few\ndata have been extracted from the Prologues of his books and from some\nlegal documents discovered in his hometown Medina del Campo (Alonso\nCort\u00e9s 1914: 10; Gonz\u00e1lez Vila 1976: 95\u201396). He\nwas a prestigious doctor who practiced his profession in his own town,\nwhich at that time enjoyed great prosperity as a center of commerce.\nHis medical reputation may have gone beyond the limits of Medina del\nCampo since he was summoned by the court of Madrid to look after the\nhealth of the Infante, the future Charles II, son of Philip II. The\norigin of his family is uncertain (the surname \u201cPereira\u201d\nindicates that its origin was probably in Galicia or Portugal). It\nseems that his family was in trade and had a favorable position.\nBecause of this professional activity it has been suggested that\nG\u00f3mez Pereira came from a family of Jewish\n\u201cconversos\u201d (Gonz\u00e1lez Vila 1976: 96\u201397;\nRodr\u00edguez Pardo 2008: 195\u2013199).\n\nThe young Pereira was sent to study Arts at the University of\nSalamanca, where a profound pedagogical renewal was just then under\nway (Mu\u00f1oz Delgado 1964: 75\u201389; Valverde 2019: ix). Among\nthe professors whose lectures he attended we must pay particular\nattention to Juan Mart\u00ednez Guijarro and Juan de Oria. The first\ncame from the University of Paris and developed at the University of\nSalamanca new teaching methods in the field of logic and natural\nphilosophy. Many years later, G\u00f3mez Pereira dedicated one of\nhis books to him as a sign of affection and admiration for the man who\nwas in charge of the education of young Philip II and became\nArchbishop of Toledo. Also, Juan de Oria \u2013 who was later\ncondemned by the Inquisition and spent his last years of life in\nseclusion \u2013 lectured on logic and natural philosophy. Oria\nprobably sparked Pereira\u2019s interest in the question of\nimmortality, since he had great acquaintance with the controversies\nwhich was occurring \u2013 especially at the universities of northern\nItaly during those years (Mu\u00f1oz Delgado 1987: vol. I,\n9\u201317; Valverde 2020: 242\u2013247).\n\nG\u00f3mez Pereira only wrote three books: the Antoniana\nMargarita, published in 1554, an Apologia that he\nredacted in 1555 to answer the objections raised against his first\nbook, and the Novae veraeque medicinae of 1558\n(Gonz\u00e1lez Vila 1976: 111\u2013114). As can be seen by the\ndates, the publication of his writings was concentrated in a few\nyears, probably at the end of his life. It is, then, likely that these\nwritings had many years of reflection, readings and experimentation\nprobably determined by his profession. The Antoniana\nMargarita, entitled so in honor of Pereira\u2019s parents, is\nhis best-known work. It is composed in three parts without any\ninternal division of chapters: the first part, which gives the title\nto the entire book, is the largest; the second is a commentary on\nAristotle\u2019s De anima III, and the third is a treatise\nDe immortalitate animorum. The discourse is arranged in a\nsequence of paragraphs whose content is sometimes announced by\nmarginal notes which are more numerous in the first part than in the\nother two. The prose is usually very dense and full of digressions,\nmany of which are so extensive that they seriously break the thread of\nthe main argument. The impression of disorder and lack of a previous\nexpository plan is certainly overwhelming, so that only the\ninteresting opening of the book, where Pereira introduces in media\nre the theme of animals\u2019 lack of sensory perception, can\nattract the interest of the reader. In his Apologia, Pereira\nsummarized and confirmed all the theses previously established in the\nAntoniana, and took the opportunity to clarify some points of\nhis own thought, as for example the nature of human soul as a simple\nsubstance that only conceptually can be divided into parts. Finally,\nthe Novae veraeque medicinae, probably published\nposthumously, were written following an empirical methodology that\naimed to discover the true causes and the effects of diseases and\naffections. For example, against the common opinion of his time and\nthe criteria of Greek and Arab medical treatises, Pereira explained\nfever as a mechanism devoted to restoring a lost equilibrium in the\nbody.\n",
