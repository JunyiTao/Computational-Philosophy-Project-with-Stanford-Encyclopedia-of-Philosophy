Nicolas Sturgeon suggests\nthat one conclusion to draw from these difficulties is that there is\nno dialectically significant ethical supervenience thesis. For\nexample, he accepts the supervenience of the ethical on the natural,\nbut he suggests that his reasons for accepting it are just his reasons\nfor accepting ethical naturalism (2009, 61). He argues that\nphilosophers who reject naturalism are likewise in a position to\nreject the supervenience of the ethical on the natural (2009,\n62\u20137).\n\nThere are two important potential ways of replying to this argument.\nFirst, one might seek a non-parochial argument for ethical\nsupervenience, such as the one suggested in\n Section 2.\n However, this might not be fully successful: as noted in\n Section 2,\n discussions of supervenience seem unavoidably to involve\ncontroversial philosophical commitments, for example to various\nspecies of modality or to philosophically interesting conceptual\ntruths. Second, one might be able to find dialectically effective\nparochial arguments. For example, Sturgeon himself seeks to make such\nan argument against the non-cognitivist (2009, 83\u201388). To take\nanother example, most ethical non-naturalists grant at least the\nstrong metaphysical supervenience of the ethical on the non-ethical,\nwhich allows the brute necessity challenge posed in\n Section 4\n to have dialectical force against them. However, some philosophers\nhave suggested that the complaint about brute necessities is itself a\nparochial one. For example, Terence Horgan and Mark Timmons (1992,\n227) suggest that the objectionability of brute supervenience\nconnections is a distinctively naturalistic commitment. This\nthought has been embraced by some non-naturalists. For example, Nick\nZangwill (1997, 509) suggests that the bruteness of ethical\nsupervenience can simply be embraced.\n\nA second way to deflate the dialectical force of ethical supervenience\nis to grant that explaining it is a good thing to do, but deny that\nthis is a particularly weighty consideration in the context of\ntheory-choice (compare Enoch 2011, 147\u20138). The issues here are\nfar from clear, but it is worth emphasizing two costs to this reply.\nFirst, as Gideon Rosen (2020) points out, embracing brute ethical\nsupervenience is inconsistent with the essentialist account of\nmodality discussed above. (Recall that according to this account, all\nnecessary truths are explained by facts about essences). Because the\nessentialist account is one of the most powerful and well-developed\naccounts of modality, embracing inconsistency with it offers up a\nsignificant hostage to metaphysical fortune. Second, the avoidance of\nbrute necessary connections seems to be a central part of metaphysical\nmethodology. Even if modal structure is not the most fundamental\nmetaphysical structure, it is typically treated as a good guide to\nsuch structure (Kment, 2015). It is hard to see why this would be so\nunless necessary connections disclosed some deeper explanatory\nrelationship. This suggests that the philosopher who wishes to find in\nethics an exception to this principle may need to provide a clear\nmethodological reason for doing so.\n",
