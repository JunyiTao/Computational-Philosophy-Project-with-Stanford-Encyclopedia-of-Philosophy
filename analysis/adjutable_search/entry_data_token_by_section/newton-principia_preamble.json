    "main_text": "\n\n\nNo work of science has drawn more attention from philosophers than\nNewton's Principia. The reasons for this, however,\nand consequently the focus of the attention have changed significantly\nfrom one century to the next. During the 20th Century\nphilosophers have viewed the Principia in the context of\nEinstein's new theory of gravity in his theory of general\nrelativity. The main issues have concerned the relation between\nNewton's and Einstein's theories of gravity and what the\nneed to replace the former with the latter says about the nature,\nscope, and limits of scientific knowledge. During most of the\n18th Century, by contrast, Newton's theory of gravity\nremained under dispute, especially because of the absence of a\nmechanism \u2014 in particular, a contact mechanism \u2014 producing\ngravitational forces. The philosophic literature correspondingly\nendeavored to clarify and to resolve, one way or the other, the dispute\nover whether the Principia should or should not be viewed as\nmethodologically well founded. By the 1790s Newton's theory\nof gravity had become established among those engaged in research in\norbital mechanics and physical geodesy, leading to the\nPrincipia becoming the exemplar of science at its\nmost successful. Philosophic interest in the Principia\nduring the 19th Century therefore came to focus on how\nNewton had achieved this success, in part to characterize the knowledge\nthat had been achieved and in part to pursue comparable knowledge in\nother areas of research. Unfortunately, a very large fraction of\nthe philosophic literature in all three centuries has suffered from a\nquite simplistic picture of the Principia itself. The\nmain goal of this entry is to replace that simplistic picture with one\nthat does more justice to the richness of both the content and the\nmethodology of the Principia.\n",
