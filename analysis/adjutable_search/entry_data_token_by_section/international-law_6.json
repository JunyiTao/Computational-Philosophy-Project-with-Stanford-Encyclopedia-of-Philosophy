    "main_text": "States and Sovereignty || Absolute Sovereignty\n3.1 Absolute Sovereignty\n\nIdentifying the matters over which sovereign states have, or should\nhave, ultimate authority is a difficult task in both an explanatory\nand normative sense. An enduring view is that the sovereignty of the\nState is absolute; a sovereign state is the final arbiter in all\ndomestic matters, with limitations to such absolute sovereignty\npermissible only where the state has consented to them. Under this\nview, the subject matter of state sovereignty covers all legal and\npolitical matters that relate to a state\u2019s territory and people.\nHobbes is the early modern thinker most commonly associated with this\nall-encompassing conception of sovereignty. This interpretation of the\nfew brief passages on international relations in the\nLeviathan is questioned by some scholars (Malcolm 2002), but\nit remains the foundation for theories of absolute sovereignty in\ninternational political thought.\n\nThe problem with theories about absolute sovereignty is that they can\nonly, at best, support a narrow consent-based idea of international\nlaw which, as the discussion of the sources of international law in\nthe earlier section has shown, does not reflect the reality of how\nrules of international law are created, interpreted and applied. Some\nclassical international law thinkers writing in the natural law\ntradition, like Alberico Gentili (Wagner 2017), argued that it was\npossible to reconcile absolute sovereignty with a fuller idea of\ninternational law by postulating that only voluntary (i.e., positive),\nbut not involuntary (i.e., natural law), rules imposed by\ninternational law on states impinge on the concept of absolute\nsovereignty. In other words, one can be absolutely sovereign and still\nsubject to natural law.\n\nWith the exception of this particular natural law tradition,\nproponents of the absolute conception of sovereignty have generally\nbeen viewed as \u201cdeniers of the \u201cLaw of\nNations\u201d\u201d (Hinsley 1986: 184). The criticism is that there\ncan be no international law unless it is accepted that, on\nsome matters at least, states must be irrevocably subject to\nan authority other than their own; the possibility of subjection to an\nexternal authority must be viewed as a necessary requirement for even\nminimal international law.\n\nThe absolute conception of sovereignty also cannot be reconciled with\nthe UN Charter, which recognizes the principle of \u201csovereign\nequality\u201d in Article 2\u2014the same provision where other\ncornerstones for the post-war order, such as the peaceful settlement\nof disputes and the prohibition on the use of force, are laid. As a\nmatter of positive international law in force today, states are not\nfully sovereign\u2014i.e., they are not the final arbiters\u2014on\nmatters pertaining to the use of force. In particular, they are not\nfree to develop a set of rules governing the use of force that\ncontravenes the prohibition in the UN Charter, nor do they have any\nlegal means of escaping such rules by withdrawing their consent. The\nsame can be said of other fundamental principles and rules, such as\nself-determination and human rights.\n\nYet international law still describes states as sovereign. The\nprinciple of sovereignty equality constructs a world order where\nstates are endowed with ultimate authority over some matters, yet\ninescapably subject to the authority of international law in others.\n(For a defence of the idea of sovereignty as a vital mechanism for\nensuring the authority of international law in an ineradicably\npluralistic world in which states disagree on what constitutes a just\nand legitimate internal public order, see Roth 2011).\n\nThat said, it is important not to confuse sovereignty in this sense of\nultimate authority with the idea of economic or political power. For\nexample, to say that the States that emerged from the collapse of the\nEuropean empires after World War II acquired sovereignty on an equal\nbasis as their former colonies is to say that they were endowed with\nthe ultimate authority to decide matters\u2014such as the regulation\nof social and economic activities in their territory\u2014which had\nhitherto been the domain of the colonial powers. Whether these newly\nindependent States also acquired the socio-economic or political clout\nto take on, for example, big multinational corporations operating in\ntheir territory, or whether they became more powerful politically than\nthe former colonial powers, is another matter. To use a different\nexample, by leaving the European Union, the United Kingdom regained\nsovereignty over matters which (unlike colonies of course) it had\nfreely agreed to transfer to the European Union during the time of its\nmembership, but whether this increase in sovereignty means an increase\nin power or influence is a different matter. Authority can be bestowed\nupon those that have no power, and power can be wielded by those with\nno authority.\n",
