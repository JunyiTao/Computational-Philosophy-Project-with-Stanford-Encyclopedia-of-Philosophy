    "main_text": "The Philosophical Significance of Perceptual Learning\n3. The Philosophical Significance of Perceptual Learning\n\nPerceptual learning is philosophically significant both in itself, and\nfor the role that it has played in prior philosophical discussions.\nSections\n 3.1\u20133.4\n will focus on the latter. However, there are good reasons to see\nperceptual learning as philosophically significant in itself,\nindependently from the role that it has played in prior philosophical\ndiscussions.\n\nWhy is perceptual learning philosophically significant? One reason is\nthat it says something about the very nature of perception\u2014that\nperception is more complex than it might seem from the first-person\npoint of view. Specifically, the fact that perceptual learning occurs\nmeans that the causes of perceptual states are not just the objects in\nour immediate environment, as it seems at first glance. Rather, given\nthe reality of perceptual learning, there is a long causal history to\nour perceptions that involves prior perception. When the expert\nwine-taster tastes the Cabernet Sauvignon, for example, that glass of\nwine alone is not the sole cause of her perceptual state. Rather, the\ncause of her perceptual state includes prior wines and prior\nperceptions of those wines. One way to put this is to say that\nperception is more than the immediate inputs into our senses. It is\ntied to our prior experiences.\n\nAnother way in which perceptual learning is philosophically\nsignificant is because it shows how perception is a product of both\nthe brain and the world. In this respect, there are some similarities\nbetween the role of constancy mechanisms and the role of perceptual\nlearning, in that both involve the brain playing a role in structuring\nperception in a way that goes beyond the perceptual input. Constancy\nmechanisms, such as those involved in shape, size, and color\nconstancy, are brain mechanisms that allow us to perceive shapes,\nsizes, and colors more stably across variations in distance or\nillumination. In cases of constancy, the brain manipulates the input\nfrom the world, and this allows the perceiver to track the shape,\nsize, or color more easily. Similarly, in cases of perceptual\nlearning, the brain manipulates the input from the world. In many\ncases, this may actually make the perception more helpful, as when\nthrough learning the perceptual system weights attention in a\nparticular way, say, towards the features relevant for identifying a\nCabernet Sauvignon. Perceptual learning might upgrade the epistemic\nstatus of perception, putting the perceiver in a better position with\nrespect to knowledge (see Siegel 2017). At the same time, people can\nlearn incorrectly, leading to perceptions that are unhelpful, as when\na new golfer with inadequate coaching develops the bad habit of\nattending to their putter while putting, rather than attending to the\ngolf ball.\n\nPerceptual learning is philosophically significant in itself. In\naddition, the rest of section 3 goes on to explore the role that\nperceptual learning has played in prior philosophical discussions.\n",
