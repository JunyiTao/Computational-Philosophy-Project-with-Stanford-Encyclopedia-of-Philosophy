    "main_text": "Russellian Monism in the History of Western Philosophy || Russellian Monism in the Seventeenth through Nineteenth Centuries\n2.1 Russellian Monism in the Seventeenth through Nineteenth Centuries\n\nOne could find views that resemble Russellian monism in certain\nrespects throughout the history of philosophy. For example,\npanpsychism is very old indeed (and not distinctive to the west). But\nit is hard to find views approximating full-fledged Russellian monism\nbefore the early modern period. This is not a coincidence: the theory\nis closely tied to modern physics, which was first developed during\nthat era. Yet it did not take long for the theory, or something akin\nto it, to emerge. Arguably, Russellian monism can be ascribed to\nvarious early modern figures, including at least Gottfried Wilhelm\nLeibniz, Immanuel Kant, and Arthur Schopenhauer.\n\nLeibniz\u2019s Russellian monist theory may be found in his critique\nof Ren\u00e9 Descartes\u2019 theory of matter (Pereboom 2011:\n92\u201397; cf. 1991a,b). In Descartes\u2019 theory, material\nsubstance is essentially just extension in three spatial dimensions\n(Descartes Principia Philosophi\u00e6, \u201cPart Two: The\nPrinciples of Material Things\u201d 1644 [1984: v. 1, 223\u2013247;\nAT VIII 40\u201379]; see the entry\n Descartes\u2019 physics).\n Leibniz contends that Descartes\u2019 theory is unsatisfactory\nbecause, first, the extension of a physical object is (in the\nterminology introduced in\n section 1.1,\n which is Kantian (Kant 1781/1787: A277/B333)) a relatively intrinsic\nproperty of it, since it resolves into the plurality, spatial\ncontinuity, and temporal coexistence of its parts, and the extension\nof those parts resolves into those extrinsic properties of their\nparts, ad infinitum; and, second, any real thing, that is,\nany actual, concrete entity, cannot possess only extrinsic or\nrelatively intrinsic properties: it must possess an absolutely\nintrinsic property as well. Leibniz writes: \u201cthere is no\ndenomination so extrinsic that it does not have an intrinsic\ndenomination at its basis\u201d (Leibniz to De Volder April 1702\n[Leibniz G II, 240; 1969: 526\u2013527]). In his view, a conception\nof the physical world that does not include absolutely intrinsic\nproperties is in an important sense incomplete. In effect, his\ncomplaint is that Descartes\u2019 theory of matter describes only\nstructure without describing a quiddistic ground for that structure,\nor even acknowledging the possibility of or the need for such a\nground.\n\nIn Leibniz\u2019s view, the absolutely intrinsic properties\nunderlying real things are at least connected to primitive\nforce (see the entry\n Leibniz\u2019s philosophy of physics).\n Primitive force (which can appear to us phenomenally as physical\nforce) generates a progression from one representation to the next in\na series, in conformity with a law (Leibniz 1698 [1969: 504; 1989:\n162\u201363]; Adams 1994: 352; Jorati 2018). On one interpretation,\nprimitive forces are the fundamental elements, \u201cthe sole\ninhabitants of the ground floor\u201d of Leibniz\u2019s ontology\n(Jorati 2018); thus, the most basic substances, mind-like monads,\n\u201cdo not have forces, strictly speaking\u2014they are\nforces\u201d (Jorati 2018; cf. Adams 1994: 265, 378\u2013379). On\nthat reading, primitive forces are the absolutely intrinsic\nproperties underlying real things. They might be called Leibnizian\nquiddities.\n\nLeibniz might be the first Russellian monist. In his view, all the\nproperties physics presents are either extrinsic or relatively\nintrinsic. This corresponds to structuralism about physics. He\ncontends there are absolutely intrinsic properties, primitive forces\non one reading, in which those extrinsic properties and relatively\nintrinsic properties are grounded. This corresponds to realism about\nquiddities. Those quiddities ground all of the other features of\nreality, including consciousness generally and macrophenomenal\nproperties specifically. This corresponds to quidditism about\nconsciousness. Thus, Leibniz seems to endorse versions of all three\ncore Russellian monist theses. And because on his view all basic\nentities, including Leibnizian quiddities and the extrinsic and\nrelatively intrinsic properties they ground, are mental, Leibnizian\nRussellian monism is a version of Russellian idealism.\n\nLike Leibniz, Kant can be seen as a Russellian monist. Kant endorses a\nversion of structuralism about physics: \u201cAll that we cognize in\nmatter are nothing but relations. What we call the intrinsic\ndeterminations of it are intrinsic only in a relative\nsense\u2026\u201d (1781/1787: A285/B341; Pereboom 1985:\n413\u201323, 1991a,b, 2011: 100\u2013101; Van Cleve 1988; Langton\n1998; cf. Holden 2004: 236\u2013263). In material objects we discover\nonly extrinsic properties and relatively intrinsic properties, never\nany properties that are absolutely intrinsic. Indeed, for Kant, matter\nitself does not have absolutely intrinsic properties. That is because\nhe regards matter as \u201cmere appearance\u201d. Thus, he writes,\n\u201cwhat it [matter] itself consists in is the mere relation of\nsomething in general to the senses\u201d (1781/1787: A285/B341). If\nmatter were instead a \u201cthing-in-itself\u201d, he implies, then\nit would need to have absolutely intrinsic properties. Nevertheless,\nin his view all features of appearance, including both matter and\nmacrophenomenal consciousness, are grounded in things-in-themselves\n(or a thing-in-itself) and thus in absolutely intrinsic\nproperties\u2014a position that suggests both realism about\nquiddities and quidditism about consciousness.\n\nAlthough Kant agrees with Leibniz that there must be absolutely\nintrinsic properties for the world to exist as we know it, he differs\nwith Leibniz about forces. In Kant\u2019s view, forces are relational\nand thus not absolutely intrinsic (1781/1787: A265/B321; 1786:\n498\u2013491). He does not say whether there are Leibnizian primitive\nforces. And he denies that we know much about the nature of the\nabsolutely intrinsic properties that, he thinks, must exist. Such\nknowledge would be tantamount to substantive knowledge of\nthings-in-themselves, and famously he contends that we lack such\nknowledge. He could therefore be described as endorsing an\nepistemological doctrine that many contemporary Russellian monists\nendorse\n (section 1.1):\n we know little about quiddities beyond the theoretical roles they are\nsupposed to play.\n\nSchopenhauer can be seen as another pre-twentieth century Russellian\nmonist. In The World as Will and Representation, he affirms\nwhat might be described as versions of structuralism about physics and\nrealism about quiddities. Natural causal explanation, he writes,\n\n\n\u2026really does nothing more than indicate the orderly arrangement\naccording to which the states of matter appear in space and\ntime\u2026 But it affords us absolutely no information about the\nintrinsic nature (das innere Wesen) of any one of these\nphenomena. (1818: Vol. 1, Bk. II, sect. 17, par. 5 [1961: 113])\n\n\nAnd he implies that those phenomena do indeed have intrinsic natures,\nwhich suggests quidditism about consciousness.\n\nSo far, Schopenhauer\u2019s view is similar to Kant\u2019s. But\nSchopenhauer does something Kant would not do. He makes a further\npositive proposal about the nature of the absolutely intrinsic\nproperties that underlie the orderly arrangement indicated by natural\ncausal explanations. Specifically, in his view the will plays\nthe key role: \u201cindeed the answer to the riddle is given to the\nsubject of knowledge who appears as an individual, and the answer is\nwill\u201d (1818: Vol. 1, Bk. II, sect. 18, par. 1 [1961: 115]). The\nabsolutely intrinsic properties in which the orderly arrangement of\nthe world of appearance is grounded are volitional\u2014and hence the\ntitle of his famous book The World as Will and Representation\n(Schopenhauer 1818: Vol. 1, Bk. II, sect. 18, par. 1 [1961: 115]; see\nthe entry\n Arthur Schopenhauer).\n\nSome find Russellian monism in works by others in the modern period as\nwell. Rebecca Copenhaver (2020) argues that George Berkeley can be\nseen as a Russellian idealist. Cole Mitchell (in correspondence)\nreports that there is a version of Russellian panprotopsychism\ndiscussed by Anthony Collins, in the 1707\u201308 Clarke-Collins\nCorrespondence.\n",
