Probabilistic Toolkit\n\nThis section begins with a review of the axioms of probability and its\ninterpretations, and then shows how probability theory helps to spot\nmistakes that people may fall prey to when they assess evidence at\ntrial, such as the prosecutor\u2019s fallacy, the base rate fallacy,\nand the defense attorney\u2019s fallacy. This section also examines\nhow probabilities are assigned to hypotheses and how hypotheses are\nformulated at different levels of granularity.\n",
