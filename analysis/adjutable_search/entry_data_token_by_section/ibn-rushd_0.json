    "main_text": "Life and Works || Life\n1.1 Life\n\nAb\u016b al-Wal\u012bd Mu\u1e25ammad ibn Ahmad Ibn Rushd was born in\nCordova in 1126. He belonged to an influential Andalusian family,\nfamous for its judicial power and for its scholarship in the religious\nsciences. His father was a prominent judge, but the most important\nfigure in the family was his grandfather, who also bears his name, Ibn\nRushd, and so the philosopher is called \u201cthe grandson\u201d\n(al-\u1e25af\u012bd) to distinguish him from his grandfather\n(al-jadd). The latter was both a well-known judge and a famed\njurist, being the author of many books in jurisprudence following the\nM\u0101lik\u012b school.\n\nUnlike\n Ibn S\u012bn\u0101\n and\n al-Ghaz\u0101l\u012b,\n Ibn Rushd did not write an autobiography, and as a result many\naspects of his life are obscure and will remain so unless new\ndocuments are discovered. The limited information we have from his\nbiographers unanimously agrees on his good conduct, his diligence in\nscience, and his fairness as a judge, while noting his interests in\nphilosophy and his adoption of certain \u201caudacious\u201d views.\nThe surviving historical sources tell us much about his teachers in\nthe religious sciences, but, with the exception of medicine, we know\nlittle about those who taught him in other fields. He was certainly\nnot a disciple of either of his famous Andalusian contemporaries,\n Ibn B\u0101jja\n or Ibn Tufayl, although he read their philosophical works. (Puig 1992\nand Ben Shar\u012bfa 1999 discuss the intellectual circles around Ibn\nRushd.)\n\nIbn Rushd was 22 when the Almohads came to power in the western\nMaghreb and Andalusia. Given that the Ibn Rushds had been prominent in\ncircles close to the previous Almoravid dynasty, it was imperative for\nthe grandson to express in his writings, and perhaps even in person,\nhis commitment to the new rulers and the Almohad creed\n(da\u02bfwa) conceptualized by Mu\u1e25ammad Ibn\nT\u016bmart (d. 1130). Some surviving testimonies suggest that Ibn\nRushd did in fact adopt Ibn T\u016bmart\u2019s creed at some point in\nhis life (see Ben Shar\u012bfa 1999).\n\nGiven the social position of his family, Ibn Rushd soon found himself\nin the ruling circles of Marrakesh and close to the princes, or at\nleast some of them, in Andalusia. He engaged in debates on\nphilosophical and theological issues with this inner circle, and there\nis a record of a meeting with Ab\u016b Ya\u02bfq\u016bb Y\u016bsuf (r.\n1163\u201384), the second Almohad ruler, who officially asked Ibn\nRushd to comment on Aristotle\u2019s works and render them\naccessible. Later he became chief physician to the caliph in\nMarrakesh.\n\nNevertheless, Ibn Rushd\u2019s relationship with the Almohad creed\nwas complex and seems to have evolved (Geoffroy 1999; Ben Ahmed\n2020c). Recently discovered revisions to his al-Kashf \u02bfan\nman\u0101hij al-adilla contain paragraphs where Ibn Rushd shows a\nsort of critical distance towards Ibn Tumart\u2019s creed. These\nparagraphs, when added to his harsh criticism of the Almohads in his\ncommentary on Plato\u2019s Republic, may help us understand\nthe evolution he underwent during his intellectual life. They may shed\nlight in particular on the disgrace he suffered at the end of his\ncareer, when, for reasons that remain unclear, he fell out of favor\nwith the Almohads and was exiled in Lucena, 60 km southeast of\nCordova. According to one account, his death took place while he was\nconfined to a residence in Marrakesh in 1198. (The definitive\nbiography, in Arabic, is Ben Shar\u012bfa 1999. For more on the\nhistorical context see Urvoy 1998 and Ben Ahmed 2020c.)\n",
