    "main_text": "The Logicality Thesis\n3. The Logicality Thesis\n\nIt is often claimed that the theories PFO and PFO+ qualify as\n\u201cpure logic\u201d. We will refer to this (admittedly vague)\nclaim as the Logicality Thesis. Since the corresponding\nlanguages are interpreted by the translation \\(\\Tr\\) into ordinary\nEnglish, this is a claim about the logicality of certain axioms and\ninferences rules of ordinary\n English.[12]\n\nEven before the Logicality Thesis is made more precise, it is possible\nto assess its plausibility for at least some of the axioms and\ninference rules of PFO and PFO+. First there are the tautologies and\nthe inference rules governing identity and the singular quantifiers.\nThere is broad consensus that these qualify as logical. Next there are\nthe inference rules governing the plural quantifiers. Since these\nrules are completely analogous to the rules governing the singular\nquantifiers, it can hardly be denied that they too qualify as logical.\nThen there are the indiscernibility axioms and the axiom that all\npluralities are non-empty. These axioms are unproblematic because they\ncan plausibly be taken to be analytic. What remains are the plural\ncomprehension axioms, where things are much less clear. For these\naxioms have no obvious singular counterparts, and their syntactical\nform indicates that they make existential claims. So it is not obvious\nthat these axioms can be taken to be purely logical.\n\nThis is not to say that it has not struck people as obvious\nthat the plural comprehension axioms are purely logical. For instance,\nBoolos asserts without argument that the translation of each plural\ncomprehension axiom into English \u201cexpresses a logical\ntruth if any sentence of English does\u201d (Boolos 1985b: 342\n[1998a: 167]; his emphasis). \n\nIn order to assess the Logicality Thesis in a more principled way,\nmore will have to be said about what it might mean for a theory to be\n\u201cpurely logical\u201d. So I will now survey some of the\nfeatures commonly thought to play a role in such a definition.\nAlthough people are free to use the word \u201clogic\u201d as they\nplease, it is important to get clear on what different usages entail;\nin particular, theories that qualify as purely logical are often\nassumed to enjoy a variety of desirable philosophical properties such\nas epistemic and ontological innocence. In the next section, where\nvarious applications of plural quantification will be discussed, I\nwill carefully note which strains of the notion of logicality our\ntheories PFO and PFO+ must possess for the various applications of\nthem to succeed.\n\nPerhaps the least controversial candidate for a defining feature of\nlogic is its topic neutrality. A logical principle is valid\nin any kind of discourse, no matter what kind of objects this\ndiscourse is concerned with. For instance, modus ponens is valid not\nonly in physics and mathematics but in religion and in the analysis of\nworks of fiction. Frege captures the idea nicely when he says that a\nlogical principle is valid in \u201cthe widest domain of all;\n[\u2026] not only the actual, not only the intuitable, but\neverything thinkable\u201d (Frege 1884: 21). Thus, whereas the\nprinciples of physics are valid only in the actual world and in worlds\nthat are nomologically similar to it, the principles of logic govern\neverything thinkable. If one of these principles is denied,\n\u201ccomplete confusion ensues\u201d (ibid.).\n\nAnother feature widely believed to be defining of logic is its\nformality: the truth of a principle of logic is guaranteed by\nthe form of thought and/or language and does not in any way\ndepend upon its matter. What this feature amounts to will\nobviously depend on how the distinction between form and matter is\nunderstood. The most popular explication of the distinction between\nform and matter derives from the widely shared view that no objects\nexist by conceptual necessity (Field 1993; Yablo 2000). On this view\nit is natural to regard anything having to do with the existence of\nobjects and with their particular characteristics as belonging to the\nmatter of thought rather than to its form. This gives rise to two\nfeatures that are often regarded as defining of logic. Firstly, logic\nhas to be ontologically innocent; that is, a principle of\nlogic cannot introduce any new ontological commitments (Boolos 1997;\nField 1984). Secondly, the basic notions of logic must not\ndiscriminate between different objects but must treat them all alike.\nThis latter idea is often spelled out as the requirement that logical\nnotions must be invariant under permutations of the domain of objects\n(Tarski 1986).\n\nA third feature which is often regarded as defining of logic is its\n(alleged) epistemic primacy. Primitive logical notions can be\ngrasped without relying on non-logical notions; and logical truths, if\nknowable, can be known independently of non-logical truths. Assume,\nfor instance, that certain set-theoretic notions or truths must be\nregarded as extra-logical. Then our grasp of the primitive logical\nnotions, or knowledge of logical truths, cannot depend on or involve\nany of this set-theoretic material.\n\nThe key question, then, is whether the plural comprehension axioms\nenjoy these features of logicality. As we will see shortly,\nsubstantial doubts have been raised, especially concerning these\naxioms\u2019 ontological innocence and epistemic primacy.\n",
