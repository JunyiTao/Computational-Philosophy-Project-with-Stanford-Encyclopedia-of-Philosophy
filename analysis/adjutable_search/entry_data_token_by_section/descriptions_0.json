    "main_text": "What are Descriptions?\n1. What are Descriptions?\n\nOrdinarily, when philosophers talk about descriptions, they have two\nkinds of expressions in mind: definite descriptions\u2014understood\nto be phrases of the form \u2018the F\u2019 (and their\nequivalents in other languages), and indefinite\ndescriptions\u2014understood to be phrases of the form \u2018an\nF\u2019 (and their equivalents in other languages). As we\nwill see, this way of carving up the kinds of descriptions is far too\nsimple.\u00a0First, there are many kinds of expressions that appear to\nhave this form but that are often argued not to be descriptions. For\nexample, in the expression \u2018John is a lawyer\u2019 it is often\nclaimed that \u2018a lawyer\u2019 is not a genuine description, but\nis rather something different\u2014a predicate for example.\n\nSecond, it is arguable that there are many expressions having surface\nforms quite different from \u2018the F\u2019 or \u2018an\nF\u2019 that could count as being descriptions. For example,\nit seems quite plausible that possessives like \u2018my father\u2019\nare descriptions (as in \u2018the father of me\u2019). Russell also\nproposed that ordinary proper names could be construed as definite\ndescriptions in disguise. Thus a name like \u2018Aristotle\u2019\nmight be taken as shorthand for \u2018the student of Plato who taught\nAlexander, wrote The Nichomachean Ethics etc.\u2019. Furthermore, as\nwe will see, it has been argued that pronouns like \u2018it\u2019\nmight \u201cstand proxy\u201d for descriptions. So, for example, the\npronoun in (1) might be taken to stand proxy for the corresponding\ndefinite description (indicated by square brackets) in (1\u2032).\n\n(1) A man came in the room. He turned on the TV.\n\n\n(1\u2032) A man came in the room. [The man who came in the room]\nturned on the TV.\n\n\nSimilarly, Ludlow (2001) suggested that temporal anaphors like\n\u2018then\u2019 and modal anaphors like \u2018that\u2019 (in\n\u2018that would have been unfortunate\u2019) are descriptions in\ndisguise.\n\nFinally, as noted above, some recent analyses of descriptions have\nconverged on the view that the contributions the determiners\n\u2018the\u2019 and \u2018a\u2019 make are not semantical, but\nrather pragmatic or even syntactic in nature. All of these\npossibilities will be discussed in due course, but for now we will\nbegin with the analysis of \u2018the F\u2019 and \u2018an\nF\u2019 first taken up in Russell (1905, 1919).\n",
