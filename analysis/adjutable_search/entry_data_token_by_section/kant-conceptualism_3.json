    "main_text": "Frame I: Conceptual Content || Relation to An Object\n3.1 Relation to An Object\n\nOne straightforward challenge to the Conceptualism thesis comes from\nclose examination of Kant\u2019s conception of \u2018content\u2019\n(Inhalt), which he understands in terms of the relation of a\nrepresentation to an object (Tolley 2011, 2013). As we have see in\nB137 above, Kant often construes the content of cognition in terms of\na relation to an object (see also B79, B83, B87), and he also says of\nsensory intuition that it \n\n\ncontain[s] [enthalten] in its representation only the\nrelation [Verh\u00e4ltni\u00df] of an object to the subject,\nand not that which is internal to the object in itself. (B67) \n\n\nMoreover, Kant describes intuition and concept as having opposing\nkinds of relation to the object they represent. Intuitions are\nimmediately related to their objects while concepts are only mediately\nso related (B93; see also B33, B41, A109, B3767; Prolegomena, \u00a78\n(4: 281); What Real Progress, 20: 266). This gives us the material for\nthe following argument.\n\nThe content of a cognition (whether intuition or concept) consists\nin\u2014i.e., is nothing but\u2014a relation to an object\nConcepts and intuitions relate to objects in different\nways\u2014viz. mediately and immediately\n\u2234 The content of intuition is different from the content of\nconcepts\nRepresentations are individuated as to type\u2014i.e., intuition\nor concept\u2014at least partly in virtue of their content\n\u2234 Intuitions cannot have conceptual content\n\n\nThis argument, if sound, shows that intuition cannot be related to an\nobject (and thus have \u2018content\u2019) by virtue of a\nconceptual content. Thus, one initial worry about\nConceptualism is that its framing of its position in terms of\n\u2018content\u2019 does not obviously cohere with how Kant thinks\nof content. However, the above argument fails to show that concepts\n(or conceptual synthesis, or the capacity for concept employment) do\nnot play any other role in the constitution of an\nintuition\u2019s relation to an object\u2014perhaps concepts are not\nthe contents of intuitions but are nevertheless necessary for an\nintuition\u2019s having a relation to an object. Let\u2019s turn\nthen to discussion of how conceptual synthesis could constitute this\nrelation.\n",
