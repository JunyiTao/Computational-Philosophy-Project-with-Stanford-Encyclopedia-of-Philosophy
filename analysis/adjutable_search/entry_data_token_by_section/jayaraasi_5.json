    "main_text": "The Method and Philosophy of Jayar\u0101\u015bi || Use of Reductio Arguments\n2.1 Use of Reductio Arguments\n\nThe point of departure of his methodology is a sophisticated and\nhighly elaborated reductio type of argument (prasa\u1e45ga),\ndeveloped earlier within the Madhyamaka school of Buddhism and its\nprominent adherent Nag\u0101rjuna (c. 150 CE).\n\nIn his method, Jayar\u0101\u015bi analyses a particular thesis T of\nhis opponent by, first, listing all logical implications or all\ndoctrinally possible conclusions C1, C2,\nC3, \u2026 Cn, admissible within the\nopponent\u2019s system, that follow from thesis T. Then he demonstrates how\nand why each of such conclusions C1, C2,\nC3, \u2026 Cn either leads to an\nundesired consequence (logically problematic or unwelcome within the\nopponent\u2019s system) or contradicts the initial thesis T:\n\n\n\n\n(1)\nT \u2192 C1 \u2227 C2 \u2227 C3\n\u2227 \u2026 \u2227 Cn \n\n(2)\n|C1| = 0\n\n|C2| = 0\n\n|C3| = 0\n\n\u2026\n\n|Cn| = 0 \n\n(3)\n|T| = 0  \n\n\n\nwhere \u20180\u2019 stands not simply for \u2018false\u2019\n(logically), but may also stand for \u2018not admissible within the\nopponent\u2019s specific set of beliefs\u2019, or \u2018not compatible\nwith the opponent\u2019s specific set of beliefs\u2019. To analyse the\ntruth value or admissibility of each of the conclusions C1,\nC2, C3, \u2026 Cn, if their\nstructure is complex, Jayar\u0101\u015bi analyses the conclusions in\ntheir turn using exactly the same method.\n\nWhat may look like a well-known logical law that underlies the\nreductio ad absurdum argument, i.e.,\n\n[(~p\u2192q) \u2227 ~q] \u2192 p,\n\n\nor like other typical laws of the proof by contradiction, i.e.,\n\n\n[(~p\u2192q) \u2227 (~p\u2192~q)] \u2192\np,\n\n[~p \u2192 (q\u2227~q)] \u2192 p, or\n\n[~p \u2192 (q\u2261~q)] \u2192 p ,\n\n\nseems at first closely mirrored by Jayar\u0101\u015bi. However, his\napproach is significantly different in one particular aspect. First,\nJayar\u0101\u015bi analyses positive theses in order to disprove them.\nSecondly, the reductio or the proof by contradiction, whereby p is\nrejected, does not commit one to admitting ~p in the sense of\naccepting a positive state of affairs contrary to p.\nJayar\u0101\u015bi is satisfied merely with a rejection of a thesis,\nwithout postulating his own solution to a problem. In other words,\nwhen Jayar\u0101\u015bi disproves thesis T by demonstrating that its\nconclusions C1, C2, C3, \u2026\nCn are all wrong (either false or doctrinally\ninadmissible), he does not commit himself to the contrary thesis ~T\nwith some kind of ontological entailment. The better way to describe\nhis method would be the following patterns:\n\n\n[(p\u2192q) \u2227 ~q] \u2192 ~p,\n\n[(p\u2192q) \u2227 (p\u2192~q)] \u2192\n~p,\n\n[p \u2192 (q\u2227~q)] \u2192 ~p, or\n\n[p \u2192 (q\u2261~q)] \u2192 ~p ,\n\n\nTo give an example, Jayar\u0101\u015bi first skillfully demonstrates\nthat the universal cannot exist by mentioning three possible\nconclusions: If (T) the universal exists, then (C1) the\nuniversal is different from the individuals in which it is\ninstantiated, (C2) it is not different from the\nindividuals, or (C3) it is different from the individuals\nin some aspects and it is not different from the individuals in other\naspects. Each of these options is then analysed into further options,\nall being eventually shown as wrong or impossible. Since all the three\nconclusions C1, C2 and C3 are\nrejected, the initial thesis T (\u2018the universal exists\u2019) is\nalso rejected. However, he does not say what at all exists, if there\nare no universals.\n\nIn his method, Jayar\u0101\u015bi does not mention all logically\nconceivable conclusions entailed by a thesis he wants to disprove. In\nmost cases, he limits himself just to those implications which are\nrelevant to the discussion with a particular philosophical school, and\nall other logical or thinkable implications of which we know that the\nopponent would never admit for a variety of reason are simply\nignored.\n\nInterestingly, the critical method of analysis of the reductio type\n(prasa\u1e45ga) which Jayar\u0101\u015bi so amply uses is basically\nabsent in the works of the Digambara philosopher Akala\u1e45ka,\nwhereas the method is regularly used by his commentator\nVidy\u0101nanda and all subsequent Jaina thinkers, which may have its\nhistorical relevance and suggest that Jayar\u0101\u015bi was posterior\nto Akala\u1e45ka.\n\nThe reductionist tactics, which Jayar\u0101\u015bi shared with the\nM\u0101dhyamika Buddhists, was traditionally classified by Brahmanic\nphilosophers, e.g. the Naiy\u0101yikas, as an eristical dispute or\nrefutation-only debate (vita\u1e47\u1e0d\u0101) and considered as a\nnon-genuine argument, because the goal of an authentic debate was to\nstrive for truth, understood of course in positive terms. Were such\ncriticisms denying Jayar\u0101\u015bi a genuine argumentative value\njustified? Clearly not, and for a variety of reasons, the most\nimportant being that the main objective of Jayar\u0101\u015bi is\nindicated in the title of his treatise: the dissolution of all\ncategories. How should we understand it? Was his approach purely\nnegative, eristical, nihilistic or agnostic? His main objective, it\nseems, was not necessarily the strong claim that no truths can ever be\nknown. Rather his intention was to show the fundamental dependence of\nour knowledge of reality on cognitive means and categories we accept\nmore or less arbitrarily. The dissolution of all categories implies\nthat the criteria on which all philosophical systems and theories of\nthe world rest are in need of further evidence, which itself is not\npossible without adopting some of these categories or some other\ncategories which again call for further evidence, but which categories\nand methods we chose is ultimately our arbitrary decision. To engage\nin what Brahmanic philosophers would call a \u2018genuine\ndebate\u2019 (v\u0101da) one would necessarily have to accept that\nsuch an arbitrary decision is ultimate and justified, thus giving up\nthe further search for truth, even though the process would be\ninfinite and doomed to terminate untimely. In other words,\ncontradictions and inconsistencies are, in fact, inherently systemic\nin the sense that they are generated by a body of propositions each\nadopted arbitrary for this or other reason, and the systemic knowledge\nultimately lacks reliable and coherent foundations. Just as with\nPyrrhonism in Sextus\u2019 interpretation, Jayar\u0101\u015bi seems to be a\nperpetual investigator: he discards all theories and propositions that\nare neither consistent nor proof-tight, for which there is also no\ncompelling evidence. But it would probably be far-fetched to claim\nthat the idea of truth did not represent any value for him.\n",
