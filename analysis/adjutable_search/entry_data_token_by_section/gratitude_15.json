    "main_text": "Gratitude and Obligation || Reluctance to Receive Beneficence\n5.2 Reluctance to Receive Beneficence\n\nIf there are indeed obligations of gratitude, this might be taken to\nimply the strange conclusion that we should do our best to avoid\naccepting or receiving favors or gifts. The spirit of this conclusion\ndates back at least to Aristotle, who wrote that the\nmegalopsychos\n\nis the sort of person who does good but is ashamed when he receives\nit; for doing good is proper to the superior person, and receiving it\nto the inferior. (Nicomachean Ethics: 1124b1110\u20131114)\n\n\nIn the modern era, Kant suggested in the Lectures on Ethics\nthat beneficiaries should cringe at receiving favors, since in doing\nso, a beneficiary becomes the debtor of his benefactor\u2014a\nshameful position (Kant 1775\u20131780 [1981]: 118\u2013119). For\nKant, owing an obligation of gratitude is especially bad,\nsince duties of gratitude are sacred duties\u2014duties\nwhich can never be fully discharged. This is because any attempt on a\nbeneficiary\u2019s part to \u201cpay off\u201d the debt of\ngratitude will always be done essentially as a reaction to the\noriginal act of benevolence. The benefactor alone has the honor of\nhaving acted benevolently in a purely proactive way. Insofar as we\nwould want to avoid being in such an eternally imbalanced\nrelationship, we should be wary of accepting gifts and favors.\n\nKant\u2019s worries about obligations of gratitude in the\nLectures on Ethics may be overstated. For one thing, it may\nwell be possible to discharge an obligation of gratitude, if by this\nwe mean get back on equal footing with a benefactor. A beneficiary\nmight one day bestow an act of benevolence for a stranger, only to\nfind out after the fact that the stranger was a benefactor of his from\nlong ago. Here, the beneficiary has benefited his benefactor, and has\ndone it not as any sort of reaction, but with the same sort of\noriginal proactive benevolence that motivated the original\nbenefactor\u2019s benevolence in the first place. Furthermore, even\nif it may be impossible ever to \u201cpay off\u201d an obligation of\ngratitude, it is usually not especially difficult to avoid\nviolating any such obligations, especially if the original\nfavor was small (Hewitt 1924). A beneficiary need not shape his life\naround respecting his obligations of gratitude, insofar as living up\nto those obligations might require only occasional minor return favors\non his part. Sacred duties of gratitude, then, need not be as\nburdensome as Kant originally suggested. And indeed, Kant himself\nseemed to soften his claims about accepting favors and the\npsychological effects of being under an obligation of gratitude. In\nthe Doctrine of Virtue, he noted that while it may be natural\nto feel shamed at being made a beneficiary, this shame is not\nrationally justified, and it results from a misunderstanding of the\nlegitimate sources of one\u2019s moral worth (Smit and Timmons\n2011).\n\nA more plausible picture of obligations of gratitude paints them as\nobligations that we ought not be upset at having. Even if those\nobligations sometimes land us in situations we find unpleasant, we\nshould not regret the benevolence that gave rise to those obligations.\nA similar point could be made about parenthood, love, or friendship.\nIn all such relationships, a parent, lover or friend will sometimes\nfind himself tightly constrained by certain obligations and\ncommitments. Such constraints may be in themselves unpleasant; but a\ngood parent, lover or friend will not take that unpleasantness as\nreason to regret the special relationship they stem from (Owens 2012).\nBy the same token, it might be argued that a good beneficiary will not\nregret or avoid having been shown benevolence, despite what\nobligations may arise as a result. Indeed, insofar as we incur moral\nobligations in accepting or receiving favors, we might even find\npleasure or pride in such obligations. Card (1988) argues that in\nbestowing a favor upon a beneficiary, we should see the benefactor as\nexpressing her faith in the beneficiary as someone worthy of\nbenevolence, and as someone who can be trusted to return a favor in\nthe future. Beneficiaries should see themselves not as debtors, with\nthe constant need to prove to benefactors that they are indeed\ngrateful, but as trustees, who already have the confidence of\ntheir depositors. On this \u201ctrusteeship paradigm\u201d,\nobligations of gratitude are obligations we are proud and honored to\nhave been given.\n\nStill, there may be wisdom in the point Kant makes in the\nLectures. We may want to be careful who we accept favors\nfrom, insofar as there are people whose interests we would not want to\nhave to consider in our future practical deliberations (Camenisch\n1981). Furthermore, even a competent trustee open for business will be\nreluctant to take on too many deposits, lest he find himself having to\npay too many back at the same time. That this reluctance may be\nreasonable finds support in the claim that sometimes, it seems,\nbenefactors may need to ask for permission before doing a favor (Card\n1988).\n",
