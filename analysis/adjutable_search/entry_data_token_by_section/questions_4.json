    "main_text": "The semantics of elementary questions || Classical semantic theories of questions\n2.1 Classical semantic theories of questions\n2.1.1 Hamblin semantics\n\nA common starting point for many formal semantic treatments of\nquestions is the idea that \u201cquestions set up a choice-situation\nbetween a set of propositions, namely those propositions that count as\nanswers to it\u201d (Hamblin 1973, 48). One way to implement this\nidea is to take a question to denote, in a world \\(w\\), the set of\npropositions that correspond to a possible answer to the question\n(Hamblin 1973). Another way to implement the same idea is to let a\nquestion denote, in a world \\(w\\), the set of propositions that\ncorrespond to its true answers in \\(w\\) (Karttunen 1977). In\nboth systems, the meaning of a question is a function from\nworlds to sets of propositions. In Hamblin\u2019s system, this\nfunction maps every possible world to the same set of propositions,\ncorresponding to the set of all possible answers; in Karttunen\u2019s\nsystem, every world is mapped to a subset of all possible answers,\nnamely those that are true in the given world. As acknowledged by\nKarttunen (1977, 10), the difference is inessential. In both cases,\nthe meaning of a question is fully determined by\u2014and could be\nidentified with\u2014the set of all propositions that correspond to a\npossible answer.\n\nA fundamental problem with these accounts is that they do not specify\nin more detail what \u201cpossible answers\u201d are supposed to be.\nOf course, they do provide a compositional semantics for a fragment of\nEnglish, and thereby specify what they take to be the possible answers\nto the questions in that fragment. But in order for these theories to\nbe evaluated, we first need to know what the notion of a\n\u201cpossible answer\u201d is intended to capture. To illustrate\nthis point, consider the following example:\n\n (8) Who is coming for\ndinner tonight? \n  a.\nPaul is coming.\n \n  b.\nOnly Paul and Nina are\ncoming.  \n  c.\nSome girls from my class\nare coming.  \n  d.\nI don\u2019t\nknow.  \n\n\nIn principle, all the responses in (8a\u2013d) could be seen as\npossible answers to (8). For Hamblin and Karttunen, only (8a) counts\nas such. However, it is not clear what the precise criteria are for\nbeing considered a possible answer, and on which grounds (8a) is to be\ndistinguished from (8b\u2013d).\n2.1.2 Partition semantics\n\nGroenendijk and Stokhof (1984) take a question to denote, in each\nworld, a single proposition embodying the true exhaustive\nanswer to the question in that world. For instance, if \\(w\\) is a\nworld in which Paul and Nina are coming for dinner, and nobody else is\ncoming, then the denotation of (8) in \\(w\\) is the proposition\nexpressed by (8b).\n\nThe meaning of a question, then, is a function from worlds to\npropositions. These propositions have two special properties: they are\nmutually exclusive (since two different exhaustive answers\nare always incompatible), and together they form a cover of\nthe entire logical space (since every world is compatible with at\nleast one exhaustive answer). So the meaning of a question can be\nidentified with a set of propositions which form a partition\nof the logical space.\n\nIn many cases, it is intuitively clear what the \u201ctrue exhaustive\nanswer\u201d to a question in a given world is, at least much clearer\nthan what all the \u201cpossible answers\u201d to that question are.\nThis means that a partition semantics can in many cases be tested\nagainst clear intuitions, unlike a Hamblin semantics.\n\nHowever, in some cases it is not so clear what the \u201ctrue\nexhaustive answer\u201d to a question in a given world is. Consider\nthe following examples (in (10) we use \\(\\uparrow\\) and \\(\\downarrow\\)\nto indicate rising and falling intonation, respectively):\n\n (9) If Ann is coming,\nwill Bill come as well? [conditional question] \n (10) Is\nAnn\\(\\uparrow\\) coming, or Bill\\(\\downarrow\\)? [alternative\nquestion] \n\n\nWhat is the true exhaustive answer to (9) in a world where Ann is\ncoming and Bill is coming as well? One option is the proposition\n\\(\\{w\\): Ann and Bill are both coming in \\(w\\}\\), but another option\nis the proposition \\(\\{w\\): if Ann is coming in \\(w\\) then Bill is\nalso coming in \\(w\\}\\). It is not quite clear pre-theoretically which\nof these two options is more suitable. Notice that if we pick the\nsecond option, then we must assume that the true exhaustive answer to\n(9) in a world where Ann is coming but Bill is not coming is \\(\\{w\\):\nif Ann is coming in \\(w\\) then Bill is not coming in \\(w\\}\\). And this\nwould mean that these two \u2018exhaustive\u2019 answers actually\noverlap (they both contain all worlds where Ann is not coming) and\nthus do not form a partition. This may be considered a reason to pick\nthe first option instead. However, this line of reasoning is purely\ntheory-internal; it seems impossible to decide on theory-external\ngrounds what the true exhaustive answers to a conditional question\nshould be taken to be. \n\nConditional questions like (9) also present another challenge for a\npartition semantics, concerning answers that deny the antecedent of\nthe conditional (in this case the answer that Ann is not coming).\nIntuitively, such answers dispel the issue raised by the question, but\ndo not resolve the issue as intended. Their status differs from\nanswers that do resolve the issue as intended (in this case the answer\nthat Bill is coming if Ann is coming, and the answer that Bill is not\ncoming if Ann is coming). In a basic partition semantics it is\nimpossible to capture this. In worlds where Ann is not coming, the\nanswer that Ann is not coming presumably is the true exhaustive\nanswer. Its special status, however, cannot be captured.\n\nA similar problem arises with alternative questions like (10). In this\ncase, the answer that neither Ann nor Bill is coming and the answer\nthat Ann and Bill are both coming have a different status than the\nanswer that only Ann is coming and the answer that only Bill is\ncoming. Again, this difference in status cannot be captured in a\nsimple partition semantics.\n",
