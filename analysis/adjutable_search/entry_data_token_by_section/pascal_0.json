    "main_text": "Life and Works\n1. Life and Works\n\n\nPascal was born in Clermont (now Clermont-Ferrand), France, on 19 June 1623, and died\nthirty-nine years later in Paris (19 August 1662). Following his\nmother's death when he was three years old, Blaise was reared by his\nfather, \u00c9tienne, in the company of his two sisters, Gilberte\n(b. 1620) and Jacqueline (b. 1625). Later, in Paris, the family hired\na maid named Louise Delfault, who became effectively a member of the\nclose-knit family. Pascal's father was an accomplished mathematician,\nand he provided the only formal education that his son enjoyed. As\nCarraud (1992: Chapter 2) shows, this arrangement was unique in the\nseventeenth century for a young man of Pascal's social status. He was\nnever trained in theology or the philosophy of the schools, and his\nexclusively domestic education focused initially on classical\nlanguages and mathematics. The decision to educate Pascal at home was\nmotivated by the fact that he suffered from very poor health for most\nof his life, beginning at the age of two. Although his sister,\nGilberte, may have exaggerated in her hagiographical biography, La\nvie de M. Pascal, she reported Pascal as claiming that\n\u201cfrom the age of eighteen, he never passed a day without\npain\u201d (I, 67: all references to Pascal's works are to Pascal,\n1998/2000, with volume and page number). He continued to be so ill\nthat, at the age of twenty-four, he could tolerate no food other than\nin liquid form, which his sisters or his nurse warmed and fed to him\ndrop by drop (Vie: I, 69).  Gilberte's biography also\nconfirms that, as his sisters matured, they assumed many of the\nnursing responsibilities for their infirm brother that would otherwise\nhave been provided by his mother had she not died prematurely.\n\n\nThe Pascal family moved residence frequently, for political and\nfinancial reasons. They transferred initially to Paris in November\n1631, although \u00c9tienne was forced to return seven years later to\nhis original home in what had meantime become Clermont-Ferrand, because he\nexpressed public dissent about the crown's fiscal policies.\nFrance had declared war on Spain in 1635, and this\nintermittent campaign lasted for most of Blaise Pascal's life.\nThe international and local political context in which Pascal lived, together\nwith very public disputes between competing religious and theological\ntraditions in which he participated, helped determine the issues to\nwhich he contributed philosophical comments in the 1640s and 1650s.\nFor example, following the revolt of the Nu-Pieds in Normandy in July 1639,\nPascal's father was awarded a new post as a tax collector in\nRouen, to which he moved in 1639; his son, Blaise, followed in 1640. While still\nin Paris, he had written the short Essai pour les coniques\n(1640) and, despite his youth, had been introduced to the Mersenne circle by\nhis father as a promising young mathematician. Later at Rouen he developed\nthe first prototype of his calculating machine (1645), and began to\nexperiment with mercury barometers. Pascal's introduction to\nbarometric experiments occurred by chance when the royal engineer,\nPierre Petit (1598\u20131667), passed through Rouen in September 1646\nand informed both Pascals, father and son, about Evangelista Torricelli's\nexperiments in Italy. Pascal performed experiments with mercury\nbarometers initially in Rouen and Paris, and published\nExp\u00e9riences nouvelles touchant la vide in 1647. Since\nhe was too ill to do so himself, he arranged for his brother-in-law,\nFlorin P\u00e9rier, to conduct on his behalf one of the most famous\nexperiments of the scientific revolution on the puy-de-D\u00f4me, in\nthe Auvergne.\n\n\nP\u00e9rier arranged for two similar barometric tubes to be\nfilled with mercury, on 19 September 1648. He left one at the bottom of\nthe mountain, and charged a local friar to keep watch during the day\nand note any changes in the height of the mercury. Together with other\nwitnesses, P\u00e9rier climbed the mountain and took readings of the\nheight of the mercury on the mountain top, and subsequently at two\nintermediate places on their return journey down the mountainside. As\nexpected, the height of the mercury column varied inversely with the height\n(above sea-level) at which the measurements were taken. When the\nexperimenters rejoined the friar at the bottom of the mountain and\ncompared the measurements on both tubes, they concurred exactly. The\nfriar reported that, throughout the day, there had been no variation in\nthe height of the mercury column that he observed, \u201cdespite the\nfact that the weather was very changeable, sometimes calm, sometimes\nrainy, sometimes very foggy and sometimes windy\u201d (I, 433).\nThe results of this experiment were published as R\u00e9cit de la\ngrande exp\u00e9rience de l'\u00e9quilibre des liqueurs\n(1648). Pascal concluded, mistakenly, that the experiment guaranteed his\ninterpretation of its results [see below, Section 4].\n\n\nPascal's initial encounter with Jansenism had occurred when he was\ntwenty-two years old. His father slipped on ice and dislocated or\nbroke his thigh in January 1646. Following the accident, the Deschamps\nbrothers, who had bone-setting and nursing skills, came to live in the\nPascal household at Rouen for three months. They introduced the family\nto the strict observance of Christianity inspired by the Dutch\ntheologian, Cornelius Jansen (1585\u20131638), and the French\ntheologian, Jean Duvergier de Hauranne, who is more commonly known as\nthe Abb\u00e9 de Saint-Cyran (1581\u20131643). The evangelical work\nof the Deschamps brothers relied partly on Jansen's short treatise,\nthe Discours sur la r\u00e9formation le l'homme\nint\u00e9rieur, which was based on the text of I John 2:16:\n\u201cFor all that is in the world is the concupiscence of the flesh\nand the concupiscence of the eyes and the pride of life, which is not\nof the Father but is of this world.\u201d Jansen taught that a desire\nfor knowledge was one form of concupiscence, and he argued that from\nthis \u201cillness \u2026 arises the investigation of nature's\nsecrets (which are irrelevant to us), knowledge of which is useless,\nand which men do not wish to know except for the sake of knowing\nthem\u201d (Jansen 2004: 24). Jansen recommended that Christians\nshould turn aside from the pride and concupiscence of human knowledge\nand scientific investigations, and that they should concentrate\nexclusively on knowledge of God. While this encounter with Jansenist\ntheology is sometimes described as Pascal's first conversion, it is\nunlikely that he had already made the definitive choice about the\ninsignificance of mathematical and scientific work that characterised\nhis change of heart in the 1650s. He returned to Paris with his\nsister, Jacqueline, in 1647. Descartes met him there, in September\n1647, during an extended trip to Paris from his\nusual residence in the north of Holland, and discussed with Pascal the\nresults they might expect if they conducted the kind of experiment\nthat was subsequently performed on the puy-de-D\u00f4me.\n\n\nThe Pascal family (\u00c9tienne, Blaise, and Jacqueline) left Paris\nagain during the civil war known as the Fronde (1648), and they\nreturned later that year to a new address in the French capital. The\nsettlement agreed by Mazarin and the regent with\nthe parlement to end the Fronde meant that \u00c9tienne had\nbecome redundant as a tax-collector in Rouen. The return to Paris was\nfollowed within a few years by a radical change in the emotional and\nnursing support that Blaise Pascal had enjoyed since his earliest\nyears. His older sister Gilberte had married Florin P\u00e9rier in\nJune 1641 and had moved to Clermont-Ferrand. However, his younger\nsister, Jacqueline, who had continued to act as his personal\nassistant, expressed a desire, in May 1648, to become a nun. She\nwanted to enter the Port-Royal convent in Paris, which was under the\nspiritual supervision of Jansenists and in which one of Arnauld's\nsisters was a prominent Abbess. \u00c9tienne's opposition caused\nJacqueline to defer implementing her decision as long as he was still\nalive. However, four months after her father's death in 1651, and\ndespite her brother's opposition, Jacqueline Pascal joined\nPort-Royal. Then, for the first time in his life, Blaise Pascal was\nalone and still in poor health. He soon began to accept spiritual\nguidance from his sister Jacqueline and subsequently from a prominent\nJansenist, Antoine Singlin (1607\u201364).\n\n\nIn the summer of 1654, Pascal returned briefly to mathematics in\ncorrespondence with Pierre Fermat (1601\u201365) about calculating\nprobabilities associated with gambling. He summarized his findings in\nthe\nTrait\u00e9 du triangle arithm\u00e9tique which, like\nmuch of his other work, remained unpublished until after his death. In\nfact, as Edwards explains (Hammond, 2003: Chapter 3), Pascal's\ncontribution to probability theory was not recognised until it was\nused by Bernoulli in the early eighteenth century.\n\n\nDuring the night of 23 November 1654, Pascal had a dreamlike or\necstatic experience which he interpreted as a religious conversion. He\nwrote a summary of the experience in a brief document entitled\nthe Memorial, which he sewed into his coat and carried with\nhim until his death eight years later. The intensity of this\nexperience resulted in a definitive change in Pascal's lifestyle, in\nhis intellectual interests, and in his personal ambitions. After 1654,\nhe terminated the mathematical discussions about which he had\ncorrespondended with Fermat, and he cancelled plans to publish a\nbooklet on the vacuum that was ready to go into print. This booklet\nappeared posthumously as Trait\u00e9s de l'\u00e9quilibre des\nliqueurs et de la pesanteur de la masse de l'air (1663), with an\nintroduction by Florin P\u00e9rier. P\u00e9rier may have\nexaggerated the other-worldly attitude of his late brother-in-law,\nwhen he wrote that, for more than ten years before his death, Pascal\nwas aware of \u201cthe vanity and nothingness of all these types of\nknowledge, and that he had acquired such disgust for them that he\ncould hardly tolerate intelligent people devoting their time to them\nand speaking seriously about them\u201d (I, 459). Pascal had entered\nthe final period of his life, which was dominated by religious\ncontroversy, continual illness, and loneliness. This was also the\nperiod in which he assumed the challenge of defending Arnauld and,\nmore generally, Jansenist theology in the Provincial\nLetters.\n\n\nAntoine Arnauld (1612\u201394) was a prominent theologian in the\nSorbonne, who was most famous for his defence of Jansenism in De la\nfr\u00e9quente communion (1643). Following the condemnation by\nPope Innocent X (May 1653) of five propositions about grace that were\nallegedly found in Jansen's posthumously published book,\nAugustinus (1640), Arnauld was threatened with censure by the\nTheology Faculty at the Sorbonne. This provoked Pascal to write a\nseries of open letters, between January 1656 and March 1657, which were\npublished one by one under a pseudonym and became known as the\nProvincial Letters. They purported to inform someone living\noutside Paris (in the provinces) about the events that were newsworthy\nin theological debates at the Sorbonne and, more widely, in the\nCatholic Church in France. The Letters rely on satire and\nridicule as much as on logic or argument to persuade readers of the\njustice of Arnauld's cause and of the unsustainability of his critics'\nobjections. However, despite Pascal's efforts, Arnauld was expelled\nfrom the Sorbonne (February 1656). Those who lived at Port-Royal des\nChamps \u2014 another convent associated with Port-Royal, which was\noutside the city boundaries \u2014 agreed to leave voluntarily (March\n1656) under threat of forcible expulsion, and the convent was\neventually razed to the ground. The Provincial Letters are\nPascal's deeply personal, angry response to the use of political power\nand church censure to decide what he considered to be a matter of\nfact, and to what he perceived as the undue influence of a lax,\nsecular Jesuit morality on those who held political and ecclesiastical\npower in France. The Jesuits were not members of the Sorbonne and were\nnot officially involved in Arnauld's censure; it is not immediately\nclear, therefore, why Pascal, in the course of writing the letters,\ndevoted so much energy to criticizing the Jesuits. He may have blamed\ntheir influence in Rome and their political connections with the\nmonarchy in France for Arnauld's censure.\n\n\nThe final years of Pascal's life were devoted to religious\ncontroversy, to the extent that his increasingly poor health\npermitted. During this period, he began to collect ideas and to draft\nnotes for a book in defence of the Catholic faith. While his health\nand premature death partly explain his failure to realise that\nambition, one might also suspect that an inherent contradiction in the\nproject's design would have made its implementation\nimpossible. Apologetic treatises in support of Christianity\ntraditionally used reasons to support\nreligious faith (e.g. a proof of God's existence, or historical\narguments to show the credibility of witnesses whose evidence is\nreported in the New Testament); however, according to Pascal's radical\ntheological position, it was impossible in principle to acquire or\nsupport genuine religious faith by reason, because genuine religious\nfaith was a pure gift from God. Pascal had collected his notes into\nbundles or liasses before he died, and had provided tentative\ntitles for each bundle; however, these notes gave no indication of the\norder in which they should be read, either within a given bundle or\neven between various bundles, and subsequent editors failed to agree\non any numbering system for the posthumously published notes. The most\nfrequently quoted modern editions of\nthe Pens\u00e9es\u2014those of Lafuma, Sellier, or Le\nGuern\u2014provide concordances to the numbering systems adopted by\nalternative editions. Given the status of the Pens\u00e9es\nas a posthumously published notebook, it also remains unclear whether\nPascal endorsed the opinions that are recorded there, or whether he\nplanned to use some of them merely for comment or critique. They are\nreliably attributed to Pascal only when he expressed similar views\nelsewhere. One of the most famous and most extensive notes in\nthe Pens\u00e9es (Fragment 397: II, 676\u201381) is the\nso-called \u2018wager\u2019 in favour of belief in God.\n\n\nCole (1995, Chapter 15) argues that Pascal exhibited signs of manic\ndepression and an almost infantile dependence on his family in his\nmature years. In addition, many of the reported details of his\npersonal life suggest a fundamentalist interpretation of religious\nbelief that is difficult to reconcile with the critical reflection\nthat defines philosophy as a discipline. For example, his\nsister's Life recorded that Pascal had an almost obsessive\nrepugnance to any expression of emotional attachment, which Gilberte\nattributed to his high regard for the virtue of modesty. She reports\nthat \u201che could not even tolerate the caresses that I received\nfrom my own children\u201d (I, 83).  Pascal believed uncritically\nthat God performs miracles, among which he included the occasion when\nhis niece was cured of a serious eye condition and the cure was\nattributed to what was believed to be a thorn from the passion of\nChrist. In general, Pascal's commitment to Jansenism was unqualified,\nalthough he denied in the Provincial Letters that he was a\nmember of Port-Royal (I, 781). Everything we know about Pascal during\nhis maturity points to a single-minded, unwavering belief in the\nexclusive truth of a radical theological position that left no\nroom for alternative religious perspectives, either\nwithin Christianity or outside it. This is not to suggest that it is\nimpossible to be a religious believer and a philosopher; there are too\nmany obvious counterexamples to such a suggestion. However, the\nintensity of Pascal's religious faith, following his conversion, seems\nto have made philosophical inquiries irrelevant to him, with the\nresult that he approached all questions during the final ten years of\nhis life almost exclusively from the perspective of his religious\nfaith. It was this perspective that predominated in\nthe Pens\u00e9es.\n\n\nThere is a complementary reason for urging caution about reading\nPascal as a philosopher. He wrote much but published little, none of\nwhich was philosophy in the sense in which that term is used\ntoday [see section 6]. Apart from his brief essays on the vacuum and\nthe Provincial Letters, all his writings were edited and\namended posthumously by collaborators who were still involved in the\ntheological controversies that had dominated Pascal's later life. For\nexample, he seems to have contributed to an early version of the\nPort-Royal Logic (Arnauld and Nicole, 1993) that was subsequently\npublished in 1662; and the\nEntretien avec M. de Sacy was composed many years after his\ndeath, based on the recollections of an editor. Thus philosophical\nopinions that were attributed to him in various writings that he left\nonly in draft versions should be read with caution, because they were\npublished posthumously by partisan proponents of Jansenism rather than\ntheir original author.  His apparent disenchantment with philosophical\nstudies is reflected in Fragment 77 of the Pens\u00e9es:\n\u201cwe do not believe the whole of philosophy to be worth one\nhour's effort\u201d (II, 566). This may also testify to the extreme\nill-health and loneliness he experienced in his final years, when he\nreported that he could find consolation for his misery only in\nreligion.\n\n\nPascal was never employed in any capacity, and he lived modestly with\nthe financial support provided by his family. He died in the care of\nhis sister, Gilberte, and was buried in the church of Saint\n\u00c9tienne du Mont, in Paris. His younger sister, Jacqueline, had\npredeceased him at the Port-Royal convent in October 1661.\n",
