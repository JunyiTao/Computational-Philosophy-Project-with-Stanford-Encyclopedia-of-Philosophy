    "main_text": "\nWhether and to what extent people are motivated by considerations\nof justice is a central topic in a number of fields including\neconomics, psychology, and business. The implications of this topic\nextend broadly, from the psychology of negotiations, to the motives\ncitizens have to pay taxes, to what considerations influence\nhealthcare allocation decisions. Given all the possible topics which\ncould be explored, this essay adopts the following parameters to help\nnarrow the focus:\n\nWe will look at the moral psychology of individuals as opposed to\nfirms, societies, or other collective entities.\nOur focus will be on empirical results, rather than armchair\nconsiderations of what the psychology of people might be like or what\nit should be like. The SEP entry on the virtue of justice discusses\nthe moral psychology of a just person (LeBar 2020). But whether people\nactually are motivated by justice or have the virtue of justice is an\nempirical question.\nThe kind of justice that will be our focus here is distributive\njustice, rather than retributive, international, transitional, or\nother kinds.\n\nMore specifically, we will examine the distributive motives and\nbehavior of individuals by consulting the empirical literature on\neconomic games. Other topics, including the relationship between\nempirical results and specific theories of distributive justice such\nas John Rawls\u2019s or Robert Nozick\u2019s, will have to be\naddressed on another occasion (Lamont and Favor 2014).\nWhy economic games? The psychologists Kun Zhao and Luke Smillie\nprovide a nice answer:\n  Economic games have become widely adopted within the\npsychological sciences, where they are used to model complex social\ninteractions and allow for rigorous empirical investigations. As\nbehavioral paradigms, they are well-controlled, manipulable, and\nreplicable\u2026making them ideal for bridging the gap between\ntheory and naturalistic data.  In personality research, they provide\nbehavioral paradigms that may complement and help validate self-report\nmeasures, and offer sharp operationalizations of somewhat slippery\nconcepts. (2015: 277\u2013278, see also Fetchenhauer and Huang 2004:\n1018)\nThere are two general kinds of economic games. Social\ndilemmas typically juxtapose short-term self-interest with\nlong-term group interests, and include the prisoner\u2019s dilemma\nand the public goods game. Bargaining games typically involve\ntwo players distributing a specific payoff (usually money), and will\nbe our focus here, as they are especially helpful for examining the\nmoral psychology of justice. Examples include the ultimatum game and\ndictator game. We will also look at a novel twist on the dictator game\nby the psychologist Daniel Batson, which has fostered a large\nexperimental literature on what he calls \u201cmoral\nhypocrisy\u201d. Finally we will connect this discussion of economic\ngames to the virtue of justice and to other personality traits such as\nagreeableness, honesty-humility, and justice sensitivity.\nBefore diving in, it is worth saying something very briefly about\nwhy empirical results might be of interest to philosophers as they\ntheorize about distributive justice. One might think, after all, that\nphilosophers tend to focus less on what people actually tend to do and\nbe like, as opposed to what they should do and be like. Nevertheless,\nin recent years philosophers in general have paid increasing attention\nto empirical research, and with respect to matters of distributive\njustice, a few important reasons for doing so are the following:\n\nEthical egoism claims that a person\u2019s central goal ought to\nbe the promotion of his or her long-term self-interest.  Most\nphilosophers reject ethical egoism. But is it psychologically\nrealistic to expect most people to act on motives other than\nself-interested ones, such as motives of fairness and justice?\nEmpirical results, such as those reviewed in the first three sections\nof this article, would bear on this question.\nRelatedly, moral philosophers have developed rich conceptions of\nthe virtue of justice and what a just person would do. But are these\nconceptions empirically adequate and psychologically realistic for\nhuman beings like us? Empirical results would bear on this question,\nand if the answer is no, then perhaps those conceptions are\nproblematized (Doris 2002; Miller 2014).\nPhilosophers might come up with normative criteria for when\nactions and institutions are just or not. But to actually apply those\ncriteria to real world concerns, they need empirical data about how\npeople and institutions are in fact behaving.\nEmpirical data is also highly relevant to philosophers interested\nin developing strategies for improvement, so that just actions, just\ninstitutions, and just character are increasingly promoted.\n\n\nThe entry is structured as follows:\n",
