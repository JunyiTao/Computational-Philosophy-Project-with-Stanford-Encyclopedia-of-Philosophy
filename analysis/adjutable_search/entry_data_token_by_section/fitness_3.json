    "main_text": "The Propensity Interpretation of Fitness\n4. The Propensity Interpretation of Fitness\n \n\nAmong philosophers of biology there has been a wide consensus that\nthe solution to problem of defining individual \u2018fitness\u2019\nis given by treating it as a probabilistic disposition. As such it\ncausally intervenes between the relationship of environments to\norganisms that cause it, and the actual rates of reproduction that are\nits effects. Thus, fitness turns out to be a\n\u201cgarden-variety\u201d dispositional concept like\n\u2018magnetic\u2019 or \u2018fragile\u2019. These properties, and\nall dispositions are distinguished both from the actual behaviour to\nwhich they give rise\u2014e.g., attracting iron filing or breaking in\nthe case of magnetism or fragility; some items are magnetic and others\nfragile without ever actually attracting iron filings or\nbreaking. Similarly, an organism can have a probabilistic disposition\nto have \\(n\\) offspring and yet \u201cunluckily\u201d never actually\nreproduce.\n\n\nDispositional concepts such as \u2018magnetic\u2019 have explanatory\npower even though they are defined in terms of causes and effects from\nwhich they are nevertheless distinct, and are realized by the\nmolecular properties of matter on which they supervene. The fact that\nfitness is a probabilistic disposition makes for no\nspecial difficulty on this analysis. The charge of tautology against\nthe theory thus rests on the mistaken demand that an explanatory\nvariable must always be defined in terms distinct from its causes and\neffects. This is a demand shown to be unreasonable by the failed\nLogical Positivists\u2019 attempts to give the empirical meanings of\ntheoretical terms independent of their explanatory roles.\n\nMutatis mutandis the same will apply to comparative fitness\ndifferences. These will be dispositions supervening on the complex of\nrelations between organisms\u2019 and environments\u2019 manifest\nproperties (Rosenberg 1978), and will give rise to differential\nreproductive rates. Thus, definitions such as the following were\nadvanced by proponents of this approach (Beatty and Mills 1979,\nBrandon 1978):\n\n\n\\(x\\) is fitter than \\(y\\) in \\(E\\) \\(=_{df}\\) \\(x\\) has a\nprobabilistic propensity \\(> .5\\) to leave more offspring than \\(y\\).\n\n\n\n\nOf course, if fitness is a probabilistic propensity, then the fitter\namong competing organisms will not always leave more offspring, and\nthe theory of natural selection will have to be understood as making\nthe claim that (probabilistic) fitness differences result in\nreproductive differences not invariably but only with some\nprobability. With the inclusion of such propensities, the tautological\nnature of the explanation is dissolved since there is no deterministic\npath between the propensity to leave more offspring and the actual\nreproductive rates. But putting aside the tautology issue, there is\nalso a scientific reason for favoring propensity approaches: since the\ntheory of natural selection allows for drift, this qualification on\nits claims will be a welcome one.\n\n\nThe question arises however of what sort of a probabilistic propensity\nthe definition invokes. One candidate that has not found much favour\namong philosophers is that the probability invoked by the definition\nis long run relative frequency. To begin with, owing to periods of\nenvironmental and genetic instability, actual frequencies may vary\nrapidly while still approaching their long run relative frequencies\n(conditional on the counterfactual assumption that environment and\ngenes had been stable). This makes it difficult to confirm measures of\nfitness so defined. Moreover, treating single case probabilities as\nlong run relative frequencies is subject to a long-standing objection. In the\nbiological case it is particularly serious owing to the role of small\nnumbers (e.g., founder effects) in evolution. Finally, if long run\nrelative frequencies reflect dispositions of organisms or populations\nto leave descendants, the question arises whether these dispositions\nare grounded on some occurrent properties or not. If not then long run\nrelative frequencies turn out to be or immediately give way to\nobjective chances. (See Earman 1985, 149.)\n\n\nSome philosophers have argued that fitnesses are precisely such\nobjective chances. Brandon and Carson (1996) held that here, as in\nquantum mechanics, we find a brute unanalyzable probabilistic\ndispositional property of a particular item, which generates the long\nrun relative frequencies. It is indeed the case that among\nphilosophers of quantum mechanics some hold that probabilistic\npropensities can explain actual frequencies [cf. Railton 1978, 216],\nand some hold that they do so via a detour into long run relative\nfrequencies. But few are comfortable with such arguments and adopt\nthem only because, at the level of the quantum mechanical\nprobabilistic propensities are indispensable and irreducible\n[cf. Lewis, 1983]. Proponents of probabilistic propensities in biology\nmay envision two possibilities here. One is that probabilistic\npropensities at the levels of phenomena that constitute the biological\nare the result of quantum probabilities \u201cpercolating up\u201d\nin Sober (1984) and Brandon\u2019s and Carson\u2019s (1996) phrase;\nthe second is that there are brute unexplainable probabilistic\npropensities at the level of fitness differences (Brandon and Carson\n1996). No one doubts the potential biological significance of quantum\npercolation. It may well be an important source of mutation\n[cf. Stamos 1999 for a discussion]. But the claim that it has\na significant role in most fitness differences is not\nsupported by any independent evidence [cf. Millstein 2000 and Glymour\n2001 for a discussion]. The claim that there are brute probabilistic\npropensities at the level of organismal fitness differences is only\nslightly more tenable. No one has adduced any evidence that, for\ninstance, the probabilistic generalizations about the behaviour of\nanimals that ethology and behavioural biology provide, are irreducibly\nprobabilistic, instead of simply expressions of the current state of\nour knowledge and ignorance of the causes and conditions of the\nbehaviour in question.\n\n\nRosenberg and Kaplan [2005] advance an alternative account of the\nnature and source of objective chances in Darwinian processes, arguing\nthat they are not quantum mechanical in origin but are identical to\nthe objective chances that operate in the processes described by the\nsecond law of thermodynamics. Of course this suggestion trades one\nproblem for another, since the source of thermodynamic chances is a\nvexed question in the philosophy of physics.\n\n\nThere is however a much more serious issue facing the propensity\ndefinition of fitness: it has long been held to be difficult to pin\ndown the specific mathematical expression of the probabilistic\npropensity that is supposed to constitute fitness altogether. The\ndifficulty reflects features of natural selection that we must\naccommodate. Failure to deal with these difficulties leads inexorably\nto the conclusion that far from providing the theoretical meaning of\nfitness, the probabilistic propensity \u201cdefinition\u201d is a\nset of an indefinitely large number of\noperational measures of fitness; moreover,\nidentifying these measures often turns on assuming as understood just\nwhat the theory of natural selection sets out to explain. And if this\nis so, the probabilistic propensity definition will not defuse the\nthreat of triviality facing the theory of natural selection. We review\nhere the research program of delivering a propensity definition of\nfitness that has sought to deal with these difficulties.\n \n\nThe first thing to notice about the \u201cdefinition\u201d\n\n\n\\(x\\) is fitter than \\(y\\) in \\(E\\) \\(=_{df}\\) \\(x\\) has\na probabilistic propensity \\(> .5\\) to leave more offspring\nthan \\(y\\)\n\n\nis that it is of course often falsified. That is, there are many\ncircumstances in which the organism of greater fitness has the\npropensity to leave fewer immediate offspring than the organism of\nlower fitness; as when for example, the larger number of a bird\u2019s\nchick all die owing to the equal division of a quantity of food which\nwould have kept a smaller number viable. More generally, as Gillespie\n(1977) has shown, the temporal and/or spatial variance in number of\noffspring may also have an important selective effect. Take a simple\nexample from Brandon (1990). If organism \\(a\\) has 2 offspring\neach year, and organism \\(b\\) has 1 offspring in odd numbered\nyears and 3 in even numbered ones, then, ceteris paribus,\nafter ten generations there will be 512 descendants of \\(a\\) and\n243 descendants of \\(b\\). The same holds if \\(a\\) and\n\\(b\\) are populations, and \\(b\\)\u2019s offspring vary between 1\nand 3 depending on location instead of period.\n \n\nAccordingly, we need to change the \u201cdefinition\u201d to\naccommodate the effects of variance:\n\n\n\\(x\\) is fitter than \\(y\\) \\(=_{df}\\) probably \\(x\\) will have more\noffspring than \\(y\\), unless their average numbers of offspring are\nequal and the temporal and/or spatial variance in \\(y\\)\u2019s\noffspring numbers is greater than the variance in \\(x\\)\u2019s, or\nthe average numbers of \\(x\\)\u2019s offspring are lower than\n\\(y\\)\u2019s, but the difference in offspring variance is large\nenough to counterbalance \\(y\\)\u2019s greater number of offspring.\n\n\n\nIt is also the case that in some biologically actual\ncircumstances\u2014for example, in circumstances in which mean\nfitnesses are low, increased variance is sometimes selected for\n(Ekbohm, Fagerstrom, and Agren 1979). As Beatty and Finsen (1987)\nfurther showed, our \u201cdefinition\u201d will also have to\naccommodate \u201cskew\u201d along with offspring numbers and\nvariance. Skew \u201cappears\u201d when one of the\n\u201ctails\u201d of the distribution contains more observations and\nthe median is therefore shifted away from the normal. Our\n\u201cdefinition\u201d of fitness must take these conditions into\naccount on pain of falsity. One simple way to do so is to add a\nceteris paribus clause to the definition. But the question\nmust then be raised of how many different exceptions to the original\ndefiniens need to be accommodated.  If the circumstances\nunder which greater offspring numbers do not make for greater fitness\nare indefinitely many, then this \u201cdefinition\u201d will be\nunsatisfactory.\n \n\nSome proponents of the propensity definition recognize this difficulty\nand are prepared to accept that at most a \u201cschematic\u201d\ndefinition can be provided. Thus Brandon writes (1990, 20):\n\n\nWe can \u2026 define the adaptedness [a synonym for expected\nfitness] of an organism O in an environment E as\nfollows:\n\n\n \\[\n\nA^*(O,E) = \\sum P(Q_i^{OE})Q_i^{OE} - f(E,\\sigma^2).\n\n\\]\n\n \n\nHere \\(Q_i^{OE}\\) are a range of possible offspring numbers in\ngeneration \\(i\\), \\(P(Q_i^{OE})\\) is the probabilistic propensity to\nleave \\(Q_i^{OE}\\) in generation \\(i\\), and most important \\(f(E,\n\\sigma^2)\\) is \u201csome function of the variance in offspring\nnumbers for a given type, \\(\\sigma^2\\), and of the pattern of\nvariation\u201d (1990, 20). Brandon means \u201csome function or\nother, we know not what in advance of examining the case.\u201d\nMoreover, we will have to add to variance other factors that determine\nthe function, such as Beatty and Finsen\u2019s skew, or the\nconditions which Ekbohm, Fagerstrom, and Agren identify as making\nhigher variance adaptive, etc. Thus, the final term in Brandon\u2019s\ndefinition will have to be expanded to \\(f(E,\\sigma^2,\\ldots)\\), where\nthe ellipsis indicate the additional statistical factors which\nsometimes combine with or cancel the variance to determine fitness\nlevels.\n\n\nBut how many such factors are there, and when do they play a non-zero\nrole in fitness? The answer is that the number of such factors is\nprobably indefinitely large. The reason for this is given by the facts\nabout natural selection as Darwin and his successors uncovered\nthem. The fact about selection which fates our\n\u201cdefinition\u201d either to being forever schematic or\nincomplete is the \u201carms-race\u201d strategic character of\nevolutionary interaction. Since every strategy for enhancing\nreproductive fitness (including how many offspring to have in a given\nenvironment) calls forth a counter-strategy among competing organisms\n(which may undercut the initial reproductive strategy), the number of\nconditions covered by our ceteris paribus clause, or\nequivalently the number of places in the function\n\\(f(E,\\sigma^2,\\ldots)\\) is equal to the number of strategies and\ncounter-strategies of reproduction available in an\nenvironment. Brandon writes, \u201cin the above definition of\n\\(A^*(O,E)\\), the function \\(f(E,\\sigma^2)\\) is a dummy function in\nthe sense that the form can be specified only after the details of the\nselection scenario have been specified\u201d (20). But, besides the\nfact Brandon admits, that the function \\(f\\) will differ for different\n\\(O\\) and \\(E\\), \\(f\\) will have to be expanded to accommodate an\nindefinite number of further statistical terms beyond\nvariance. Schematically, it will take the form\n\\(f(E,\\sigma^2,\\ldots)\\). Again, adapting Brandon\u2019s notation,\nnone of the members of the set which express his multiply generic\n\u201cdefinition\u201d of \u201cadaptedness\u201d or\n\u201cexpected fitness\u201d, \n\\(\\{\\Sigma P(Q_i^{OE})Q_i^{OE} - f_1(E,\\sigma^2, \\ldots)\\), \n\\(\\Sigma P(Q_i^{OE})Q_i^{OE} - f_2(E,\\sigma^2, \\ldots)\\), \n\\(\\Sigma P(Q_i^{OE})Q_i^{OE} - f_3(E,\\sigma^2, \\ldots)\\), \n\\(\\ldots\\}\\),  \nis in fact a definition of either term. It is the set of operational\nmeasurements of the property of comparative fitness.\n \n\nPhilosophers dissatisfied with this conclusion have continued to\nsearch for a propensity definition of fitness that is\ncounterexample-free and not schematic or generic in Brandon\u2019s\nsense. A promising candidate is due to Pence and Ramsey (2013). A\nbrief account is given here.\n \n\nConsider all the possible daughter lineages or lines of descent from\nsome individual, \\(o\\). Call each of the possible lineages \\(\\omega\\)\nand the set of them \\(\\Omega\\). For each lineage \\(\\omega_i\\) the\nprobability that \\(o\\)\u2019s actual daughter population is\n\\(\\omega_i\\) will be \\(Pr(\\omega_i)\\). \\(F\\), the fitness of \\(o\\),\nwill not be given by weighted sums of possible daughter populations at\na specific generation in the future, but rather by this value over the\nlong run, as the number of generations increases without limit.  The\ndefinition of individual fitness, \\(F\\), is then given by the\nfollowing equation (Pence and Ramsey 2013, 862; equation (4)):\n\n\n\\[\nF = \\exp \\left( \\lim_{t \\to \\infty} \\frac{1}{t} \\int_{\\omega\\in\n\\Omega} Pr(\\omega ) \\cdot \\ln(\\phi(\\omega ,t)) \\mathrm d \\omega\n\\right)\n\\]\n\n\n(where \\(\\phi(\\omega ,t)\\) is a function that gives the size of a\ndaughter population at some future time \\(t\\)).  Of course if every\npossible daughter lineage becomes extinct eventually then in the limit\n\\(F = 0\\), and if some populations fluctuate wildly, \\(F\\) may not\nconverge to a stable value in the limit either. But there are\nconditions under which the limit as the number of generations goes to\ninfinity is guaranteed to exist and under which \\(F\\) is well-defined\n(see Pence and Ramsey 2013, 862).\n\n\nThis equation is also subject to some further conditions Pence and Ramsey\nargue are biologically reasonable, for example that selection is\ndensity dependent, that there is an extinction threshold of some\npopulation size below which extinction obtains, and most important\nthat the population dynamics are non-chaotic. Pence and Ramsey show\nhow their definition avoids all of the problems discussed above, as\nwell as some other counterexamples to previous proposals, owing to its\nincorporating and combining all possible daughter populations over\nindefinitely many reproductive generations. They also show that a\ngeneral version of the same equation has been independently derived by\nmathematical biologists, and they argue that so defined, fitness has a\nsubstantial role to play in biology, especially the field of\n\u201cadaptive dynamics\u201d. They show how standard operation\nfitness measures biologists employ can be derived from the definition,\nincluding the simple geometric and arithmetic means, along with their\nhigher moments (variance, skew, etc.) when multi-generational effects\nare present. Thus, for example, Pence and Ramsey\u2019s proposal has\nthe result that an organism with a probability of reproducing one\noffspring per generation equal to 1 will be fitter than an organism\nwith a .5 probability of 0 offspring and a .5 probability of 2\noffspring, since the second organism\u2019s possible lines of descent\nwill all have a probability of extinction that approaches 1 as time\napproaches infinity.\n \n\nSuppose that the Pence and Ramsey proposal adequately deals with the\ncounter-example problems that confronted earlier probabilistic\npropensity definitions of fitness. The question of whether this\ndefinition is adequate for trait fitness as well as for individual\nfitness and fitness differences remains. To begin with there is matter\nof whether the definition merely provides units in which to measure\nfitness the way that plainly operational definitions do, by contrast\nwith definitions of dispositions in terms of their occurrent\nbases. The supervenience of fitness on a vast and heterogeneous base\nmakes such a reductive definition impossible and as we have seen the\necological characterization in terms of \u201cdesign problems\u201d\nhas its limits as well. Moreover, some have argued that the propensity\ndefinition is at most only a component of the meaning of trait\nfitness. As noted above, some philosophers (e.g., Ariew and Ernst\n(2007, 296)) argue that trait fitness is often a matter of population\nsize and structure and conditions of genetic heritability, and these\nfactors are \u201cextrinsic to the causal properties of the\nindividual\u201d in its local environment. From this conclusion it\nseems an easy matter to infer that as it functions in the theory of\nnatural selection, trait fitness may not be causal force at all. It\nmay, after all, be a \u201cbook-keeping\u201d notion, one which\nallows us to make predictive inferences without having any\n\u201cbiological reality\u201d.\n",
