    "main_text": "Miracles\n6. Miracles\n\nMiracles are an essential and fundamental element of the major\nmonotheistic religions (i.e., Judaism, Christianity, Islam). The\naccounts of\n miracles,\n as presented in scripture and elsewhere, are supposed to confirm the\nauthenticity and authority of scripture and the prophets and, more\nimportantly, establish that God has revealed himself to human beings\nthrough these special acts or events. From the point of view of\nChristianity, one miracle of particular significance is the\nresurrection of Jesus Christ. To doubt or question the truth of this\nevent is to doubt the core and distinct meaning and doctrine of the\nChristian religion. It would be to cast doubt on the claim that Christ\nis God and the saviour of human kind. A major concern of Hume\u2019s,\nespecially as presented in Section X of the first Enquiry,\nwas to discredit miracle claims of this kind \u2014 a concern Hume\nshared with many other religious critics of his day (see Burns\n1981).\n\nAccording to Hume\u2019s account, \u201ca miracle is a violation of\na law of nature\u201d (EU, 11.12/114). More specifically, it is\n\u201ca transgression of a law of nature by a particular volition of\nthe Deity, or by the interposition of some invisible agent\u201d (EU,\n11.12n/115n). As defined, a miracle may occur without any person\nobserving it (i.e., it may be completely unknown). Hume\u2019s\nadditional proviso that a miracle is not only a violation of a law of\nnature but also requires the direct activity of God (or some\n\u201cinvisible agent\u201d) is a significant qualification. It\nfollows from this that we cannot establish that a miracle has occurred\nby showing only that the laws of nature have been violated, as this\nmay only be a chance or capricious event (EU, 8.25/96; cp. T,\n1.3.13.33/171). Nevertheless, the key issue, for Hume\u2019s critique\nof miracles, is whether or not we ever have reason to believe on the\nbasis of testimony that a law of nature has been violated.\nHume\u2019s arguments lead to the conclusion that we never have\nreason to believe miracle reports as passed on to us.\n\nA law of nature, as Hume interprets it, involves a uniform regularity\nof events. We discover laws of nature on the basis of our experience\nof constant conjunctions of events or objects. An obvious example of\nthis, provided by Hume, is that \u201call men must die\u201d (EU,\n11.12/114). It would, therefore, be \u201ca miracle, that a dead man\nshould come to life\u201d because we have \u201cuniform\nexperience\u201d that tells against such a claim (EU, 11.12/ 115).\nWhen we have uniform experience that confirms the existence of\nregularities of this kind we have, says Hume, \u201ca direct and full\nproof, from the nature of the fact, against the existence of the\nmiracle\u201d (EU, 11.12/115). The point that Hume is concerned to\nmake here is that the \u201cultimate standard\u201d by which we must\njudge whether a miracle has occurred is (much) higher than it is in\nthe case of other reports claiming to establish some unusual or\nunexpected event. It is, for example, no miracle that a man in good\nhealth should suddenly die. Although an event of this kind may be\nimprobable, it does sometimes occur. In the case of miracles, however,\nwe are asked to believe something that is contrary to all other\nexperience and observation (e.g., resurrection from the dead).\nMiracles must be unique (or nearly unique) events otherwise they fall\nwithin the \u201ccommon course of nature\u201d, no matter how rare\nand unusual the event may be.\n\nGiven this account of miracles, understood as violations of laws of\nnature, how should we evaluate claims that miracles have occurred? The\nprinciple that Hume relies on, for this purpose, is that a reasonable\nperson \u201cproportions his belief to the evidence\u201d (EU,\n11.4/110). In the case of miracles, the relevant evidence that we need\nto weigh comes from two distinct sources that must be balanced against\neach other. On one side, there is the question of the credibility of\nthe witnesses to the event. That is to say, we need to ask if we can\nrely on the truthfulness and judgment of the individual(s) who report\nthat the relevant event took place. On the other side, there is the\nquestion of the credibility of the fact itself (i.e., that a violation\nof a law of nature occurred). Clearly, in circumstances where there is\nsome opposition between these two sets of considerations, the\nreasonable person will believe that which has the superior evidence in\nits support.\n\nIf we follow this procedure, Hume claims, we must conclude that\n\u201cno testimony for any kind of a miracle has ever amounted to a\nprobability, much less to a proof; and that, even supposing it\namounted to a proof, it would be opposed by another\nproof\u2026.\u201d (EU, 11.35/ 127). Hume establishes this general\npoint in two related moves. The evidence telling against the\noccurrence of a miracle must always constitute a full proof \u2014\nsince we have uniform human experience in support of the laws of\nnature (EU, 11.12/115). It follows from this:\n\nThat no testimony is sufficient to establish a miracle, unless the\ntestimony be of such a kind, that its falsehood would be more\nmiraculous, than the fact, which it endeavours to establish; and even\nin that case there is a mutual destruction of arguments\u2026 (EU,\n11.13 / 116)\n\n\nThe only basis for giving any credibility to miracle reports \u2013\nsince by their nature they are wholly unlikely \u2014 is to give\nweight and credibility to the character and authority of the witnesses\nto the event(s). However, even in the optimal case, where the\ncredibility of the witnesses and their reports are judged to be beyond\ndoubt and wholly reliable, we are faced with evidence that is equally\nopposed \u2014 \u201cproof against proof\u201d.\n\nHume\u2019s argument, up to this point, supposes that the testimony\nin support of a miracle \u201camounts to an entire proof\u201d and\nis wholly reliable. However, the fact is, Hume argues, that this\nconcession is \u201ca great deal too liberal\u201d. If we consider\nthe specific circumstances and conditions in which miracle reports\ngenerally occur, and the sources they come from, Hume believes we will\nhave to conclude that testimony in support of actual historical\nmiracles, of the kind that the major religions rely on, are far from\nreliable. The relevant standards by which we judge the reliability of\ntestimony (i.e. in ordinary life \u2014 including law and history, as\nwell as religion) involve several different considerations. Hume\nmentions four categories of consideration about the reliability of\ntestimony. Each of them is such that the credibility of the testimony\nmay be diminished when we give due weight to these factors.\n\nThe first category concerns the witnesses to the event. Obviously the\ncredibility of an event increases when more witnesses attest to it. We\nalso need to know about the character and competence of the\nwitness(es). If they are educated, sensible and critical we will more\nreadily believe them than if they are ignorant and gullible. A second\ncategory of consideration that Hume mentions is that there is a\ngeneral psychological weakness in human nature whereby we want to\nbelieve in events that produce feelings of surprise and wonder because\nthese are \u201cagreeable emotions\u201d (EU, 11.16/117).\n\nAs belief is almost absolutely requisite to the exciting our passions,\nso the passions in their turn are very favourable to belief\u2026\nAdmiration and surprise have the same effect as the other passions;\nand accordingly we may observe, that among the vulgar, quacks and\nprojectors meet with a more easy faith upon account of their\nmagnificent pretensions, than if they kept themselves within the\nbounds of moderation. The first astonishment, which naturally attends\ntheir miraculous relations, spreads itself over the whole soul, and so\nvivifies and enlivens the idea that it resembles the inferences we\ndraw from experience. (T, 1.3.10.4 / 120)\n\n\nThis natural disposition leads to credulity and \u201csubdues the\nunderstanding\u201d (EU, 11.17/ 117\u20138; T, 1.3.9.12 / 113).\n\u201cLove of wonder\u201d is often joined with \u201cthe spirit of\nreligion\u201d whereby the religionist, \u201cwith the best\nintentions in the world, for the sake of promoting so holy a\ncause\u201d, is more powerfully drawn to belief (EU, 11.17 /\n117\u20138). Hume also notes that lies have been told in all ages and\nthat the frequent repetition of lies promotes belief (T, 1.3.9.19 /\n117; cp. T, 1.3.5.6 / 86). More generally, custom and education\ninfluence belief and in many cases \u201ctake such deep root that\n\u2018tis impossible for us, by all the powers of reason and\nexperience to eradicate them\u201d (T, 1.3.9.17 / 116). The third\nrange of factors Hume mentions are the variable historical and social\nconditions that affect credulity. Although there is a universal\npropensity to credulity, Hume notes that miraculous and supernatural\nevents \u201care observed chiefly to abound among ignorant and\nbarbarous nations\u201d (EU, 11.20 / 119). Finally, the authority of\nmiracle reports is diminished by the consideration that the miracle\nreports coming from rival religions tend to diminish the authority and\ncredibility of all of them (EU, 11.24 / 121\u20132). The result of\ngiving weight to these various considerations is that the credulity of\nactual historical miracle claims is radically diminished. Hume\nbelieves that there is no probability left in support of them.\n\nHume\u2019s views on miracles have been criticized from a variety of\nperspectives. Some critics have claimed that Hume, in laying down that\nmiracles run up against uniform experience, is simply assuming at the\noutset that the probability of miracle occurrences is equal to zero\n(see Johnson 1999 and Earman 2003). In response to this is has been\npointed out that Hume\u2019s concern is not with the factual question\nas to whether miracles have occurred or not, but with the epistemic\nquestion of whether it can be rational to believe miracle reports\n(see, e.g., Fogelin 2003). An even more problematic line of criticism\nconsists in claiming that Hume denies the very possibility of miracles\noccurring. As it stands, this misrepresents his view. According to\nHume, miracles are entirely possible in the sense that there is no\nabsurdity or contradiction involved in suggesting that the laws of\nnature are violated \u2014 this is at least conceivable. Nor does\nHume deny that rare, unusual, surprising and wonderous events do\nactually occur. There may even be circumstances when extraordinary\nevents of this kind may be justifiably believed on the basis of\ntestimony (EU, 11.36 /127\u20138). Moreover, Hume also recognizes\nthat events frequently occur that are unexpected and which we do not\nknow the cause(s) of (EU, 8.12\u20134 / 86\u20137). None of these\nconsiderations, however, show that the laws of nature have actually\nbeen violated. On the contrary, our experience shows that when\n\u201cirregular and extraordinary\u201d events do occur a closer\nexamination and investigation generally uncovers the relevant\n\u201chidden\u201d or \u201cconcealed\u201d causes that were at\nwork. Only the ignorant and vulgar conclude, in circumstances of this\nkind, that the laws of nature have been violated or that a miracle has\noccurred. It is in this sense that Hume maintains that miracles do not\noccur. In this way, the evidence of experience shows us, Hume\nsuggests, that nature is uniform and regular. When this appears not to\nbe so, subsequent experience and closer investigation reveals that\nthis is a sign only of human ignorance and credulity, not of any\n(incomprehensible) divine activity.\n\nWhat really matters for assessing Hume\u2019s critique of miracles is\nto keep in mind that his primary aim is to discredit the actual\nhistorical miracle claims that are supposed to provide authority and\ncredibility for the major established religions \u2014 most\nobviously, Christianity. From this perspective, the central issue is\nnot whether Hume is right in claiming that it is impossible for any\nmiracle claim to be established as morally certain (i.e.,\n\u201cproved\u201d), but if he is right in claiming that the\nhistorical miracle claims supporting the major religions such as\nChristianity pass this standard. It is Hume\u2019s judgment that when\nwe weigh the relevant evidence, and proportion our belief accordingly,\nwe will find that these claims are rationally unbelievable.\n",
