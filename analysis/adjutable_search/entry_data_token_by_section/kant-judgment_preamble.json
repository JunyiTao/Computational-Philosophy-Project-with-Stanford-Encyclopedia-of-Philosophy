    "main_text": "\n\nTheories of judgment, whether cognitive (i.e.,\nobject-representing, thought-expressing, truth-apt) judgment or\npractical (i.e., act-representing, choice-expressing,\nevaluation-apt) judgment, bring together fundamental issues in\nsemantics, logic, cognitive psychology, and epistemology (collectively\nproviding for what can be called the four \u201cfaces\u201d of\ncognitive judgment [see also Martin 2006]), as well as action theory,\nmoral psychology, and ethics (collectively providing for the three\n\u201cfaces\u201d of practical judgment): indeed, the notion of\njudgment is central to any general theory of human rationality. But\nKant\u2019s theory of judgment differs sharply from many other\ntheories of judgment, both traditional and contemporary, in three\nways: (1) by taking the innate capacity for judgment to be the\ncentral cognitive faculty of the rational human mind, (2) by\ninsisting on the semantic, logical, psychological, epistemic, and\npractical priority of the propositional content of a\njudgment, and (3) by systematically embedding judgment within\nthe metaphysics of transcendental idealism . Several serious\nproblems are generated by the interplay of the first two factors with\nthe third. This in turn suggests that the other two parts of\nKant\u2019s theory of judgment can be logically detached from the\nstrongest version of his transcendental idealism and defended\nindependently of it. This entry also includes five supplementary\ndocuments covering (i) the debate about Kant\u2019s conceptualism vs.\nKant\u2019s non-conceptualism, (ii) the epistemology of Kantian\njudgment and the ethics of Kantian belief, (iii) Kant\u2019s logic in\nrelation to his theory of judgment, (iv) kinds of use for judgments,\nand (v) completing the picture of Kant\u2019s metaphysics of\njudgment. \n",
