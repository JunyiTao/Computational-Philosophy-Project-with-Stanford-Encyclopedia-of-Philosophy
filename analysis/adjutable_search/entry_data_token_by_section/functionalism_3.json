Turing proposed that the\nquestion, \u201cCan machines think?\u201d can be replaced by the\nquestion, \u201cIs it theoretically possible for a finite state\ndigital computer, provided with a large but finite table of\ninstructions, or program, to provide responses to questions that would\nfool an unknowing interrogator into thinking it is a human\nbeing?\u201d Now, in deference to its author, this question is most\noften expressed as \u201cIs it theoretically possible for a Turing\nmachine (appropriately programmed) to pass the Turing Test?\u201d\n(See the entry on the\n Turing Test.)\n\nIn arguing that this question is a legitimate replacement for the\noriginal (and speculating that its answer is \u201cyes\u201d),\nTuring identifies thoughts with states of a system defined solely by\ntheir roles in producing further internal states and verbal outputs,\ngiven certain verbal inputs \u2013 a view on which, like\nHobbes\u2019s and subsequent functionalist theories \u2013 many\nphysically different systems could have internal states that play\nthese roles. Indeed, Turing\u2019s work was explicitly invoked by\nmany theorists during the beginning stages of 20th century\nfunctionalism, and was the avowed inspiration for a class of theories,\nthe \u201cmachine state\u201d theories most firmly associated with\nHilary Putnam (1960, 1967) that had an important role in the early\ndevelopment of the doctrine.\n",
