    "main_text": "Logic || Obligationes\n2.1 Obligationes\n\nSince most of Heytesbury\u2019s logical views are spelled out either\nin the context or in terms of\n obligationes,[5]\n a brief note on these must be the starting point of their\npresentation. The most important passages are in [SCD] and [Soph] and\nto a certain degree in [RSS]. Three problems will be introduced: 1)\nthe basic concepts, and in particular, relevance; 2) the distinction\nbetween metaphysical and epistemic possibility; and 3) the distinction\nbetween conceding a sentence and conceding that a sentence is\ntrue.\n\nHeytesbury\u2019s obligationes are zero-sum and dynamic\nconsistency games participated in by two players, an\n\u201copponent\u201d and a \u201crespondent\u201d. The opponent\nposits a \u201ccasus\u201d (ponitur casus), i.e.,\nthe initial linguistic and extra-linguistic assumptions, and proposes\nparticular sentences. The respondent admits or denies the\ncasus (admittitur, negatur casus) depending\non its consistency and concedes (concedo), negates\n(nego), or doubts (dubito) the proposed sentences,\nthe criteria being logical relations to either the casus or\nto the totality of preceding moves (including the casus).\nHeytesbury chooses the latter option, thus subscribing to so-called\n\u201cantiqua responsio\u201d (Read 2013: 20\u201323). The\nrespondent wins if he maintains consistency.\n\nSentences proposed to the respondent split into \u201crelevant\u201d\nor \u201cirrelevant\u201d depending on their logical relation to\npreceding moves. If the sentence proposed to the respondent or its\nnegation follows from preceding moves, it is relevant\n(pertinens) and should be either conceded (if implied by\nthese moves) or negated (if it is incompatible with them); otherwise,\nit is irrelevant (impertinens). An irrelevant sentence is\neither conceded, negated, or doubted depending on the\nrespondent\u2019s knowledge about the \u201cexternal\u201d world;\nit is conceded if known to be actually true, negated if known to be\nactually false and doubted otherwise. Such a game is dynamic in the\nsense that the status of irrelevant sentences can change in the course\nof the game ([SCD] 1494: fol. 4ra\u2013rb [1988a: 432\u2013433]).\nThis can happen for two reasons. First, if the external world changes\nduring the game, the respondent\u2019s move would change along with\nhis new information state since the respondent\u2019s moves regarding\nirrelevant sentences depend on his knowledge of the external world\n([SCD] 1494: fol. 4rb [1988a: 433]). The second (and more interesting)\ncase is brought about by the course of a particular game.\nHeytesbury\u2019s example is the following game:\n\n\nGame 1.\n\n\nOpponent\u2019s\u00a0moves\nRespondent\u2019s\u00a0moves\nJustification \n\n[O1] POSITIO: The king is seated or you are in\nRome.\n[R1] I admit the casus.\nThe casus is possible. \n\n[O2] PROPONITUR: The king is seated.\n[R2] I doubt that.\nIrrelevant and not known to be true or false in the external\nworld. \n\n[O3] PROPONITUR: You are in Rome.\n[R3] I negate that.\nIrrelevant and known to be false. \n\n[O4] PROPONITUR: The king is seated.\n[R4] I concede that.\nRelevant and implied by [R1] and\n[R3].  \n\n\n\n[R2] and [R4] are correct moves because [R1] and [R3] are. When\n\u201cthe king is seated\u201d is proposed in [O2], it can only be\nrelevant with respect to [R1], which is not the case as disjunctions\ndo not entail their sub-formulas. If the respondent is unaware of the\nking\u2019s whereabouts, the sentence must be doubted. \u201cYou are\nin Rome\u201d proposed in [O3] is also irrelevant, but can be negated\nas known to be false in the external world. At that point, \u201cthe\nking is seated\u201d becomes relevant and must be conceded as implied\nby \u201cthe king is seated or you are in Rome\u201d and the\nnegation of \u201cyou are in Rome\u201d via disjunctive syllogism\n([SCD] 1494: fol. 4rb [1988a: 433\u2013434]).\n\nHeytesbury considers three types of casus: a) possible; b)\nimpossible but imaginable; and c) impossible and unimaginable ([Soph]\nsoph. 18 and 31 [1494: fols. 131va\u2013vb and 162va\u2013vb]). The\ncriteria of possibility, which probably pertain to metaphysics, are\nnot spelled out clearly. The criteria of imaginability are logical and\nepistemological:\n\n\nBriefly, every casus which is not explicitly inconsistent or\nimpossible in a way not easily imaginable (such as a man being a\ndonkey etc.) can be admitted for the sake of disputation. But first,\nthe respondent has to make the impossibility of such casus\nexplicit and emphasize that he has not admitted the casus as\npossible but merely as imaginable, to defend its implications (as\nimaginable, not as possible) and to negate what is incompatible with\nit in accord with his obligation. ([Soph] soph. 31 [1494: fol.\n162va\u2013vb])\n\n\nThe realm of the imaginable includes whatever is epistemically\nadmissible for either logical or epistemic reasons. Neither is purely\nobjective: what can and cannot be imagined seems player-relative, as\nis being \u201cexplicitly\u201d inconsistent (for seeing or\noverlooking a contradiction is a matter of individual skill). Examples\nof the imaginable include the existence of a vacuum, infinite\nvelocities, expansions of physical objects, and men being immortal,\nbut not men being\n donkeys.[6]\n The criteria may be practical: certain hypotheses are not productive.\nSince the respondent\u2019s goal is to maintain consistency,\naccepting overtly inconsistent assumptions is a\n nonstarter,[7]\n and certain impossibilities are such that nobody would agree to\ndefend them even for the sake of\n argument.[8]\n Defining admissibility in terms of imaginability makes\nobligationes into a framework for discussing\n\u201cimpossibilities\u201d with applications in\n physics[9]\n as a science based on conceptual analysis and\n thought-experiments,[10]\n where the \u201csecundum imaginationem\u201d assumptions\nplay the same role as the modern day idealizations such as mass points\nor frictionless\n movement.[11]\n\nA principle utilized in Heytesbury\u2019s solution to various\nparadoxes states that a proposed sentence is evaluated according to\nits standard meaning, even if it is assumed to signify something else\nin the casus. For instance, the following moves of the\nrespondent would be correct:\n\n\nGame 2.\n\n\nOpponent\u2019s\u00a0moves\nRespondent\u2019s\u00a0moves\nJustification \n\n[O1] POSITIO: \u201cAll mice are grey\u201d\nsignifies that all cats are blue. All cats are white.\n[R1] I concede the casus.\nThe casus is possible. \n\n[O2] PROPONITUR: All mice are grey.\n[R2] I concede that.\nIrrelevant and known to be true in the external world.\n\n\n[O3] PROPONITUR: The sentence \u201call mice\nare grey\u201d is true.\n[R3] I negate that.\nRelevant and inconsistent with the casus. \n\n\n\n\nBy [R2], the respondent agrees that all mice are grey, while by [R3]\nhe denies that all cats are blue. To concede a sentence is to agree\nthat what the sentence signifies according to its standard meaning is\nthe case, but to concede that a certain sentence is true is to agree\nthat what the sentence signifies in the casus is the case.\nThese may or may not be the same depending on the casus.\n([SophAs]\n 412)[12]\n",
