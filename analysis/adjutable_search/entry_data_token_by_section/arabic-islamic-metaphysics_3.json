    "main_text": "\u1e6e\u0101bit ibn Qurra\n4. \u1e6e\u0101bit ibn Qurra\n\nAccording to historical sources, \u1e6e\u0101bit ibn Qurra (d. 901)\nmight have revised the translation into Arabic of Themistius\u2019\nparaphrase of Metaphysics Lambda. More importantly, this\nauthor wrote the first known extant Arabic commentary on the\nMetaphysics, still glossed by Ibn Taymiyya (d. 1328) four\ncenturies later, according to the method of concise exposition\n(tal\u1e2b\u012b\u1e63), i.e., isolating the most relevant\npoints of the commented text. This commentary shares with\nal-Kind\u012b\u2019s works a special regard for the place of\nphilosophical theology within metaphysics, since it focuses on book\nLambda of Aristotle\u2019s Metaphysics. Also Kindian is the\neffort to accommodate Islamic monotheism, by insisting on the oneness\nand willful action of God, and by adopting the Porphyrian theme of the\nharmony between Aristotle\u2019s and Plato\u2019s teaching. At\nvariance with al-Kind\u012b, by contrast, is \u1e6e\u0101bit\u2019s\nendorsing of the doctrine of the eternity of the world, rather than\nits creation in time, against Philoponus, and the minimal reliance on\nNeoplatonic writings. The background of the commentary is decidedly\nAristotelian, with some possible influence of the Peripatetic\ncommentators (most notably Themistius, who however is never\nmentioned); nonetheless, \u1e6e\u0101bit revises some crucial tenets\nof Aristotle\u2019s philosophical theology, by understanding, for\nexample, the First Mover as the first cause not only of the motion of\nthe universe, but also of its existence.\n",
