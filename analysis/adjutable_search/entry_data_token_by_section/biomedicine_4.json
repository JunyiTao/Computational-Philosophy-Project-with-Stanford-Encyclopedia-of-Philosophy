    "main_text": "Ontological and Metaphysical Commitments in Biomedicine || Ontology of the body and life in biomedicine\n2.1 Ontology of the body and life in biomedicine\n\nWhat makes patients and their bodies special? Some philosophers of\nbiomedicine have attempted to make headway in this question by\nprovocatively asking what it means for biomedical sciences to be\n\u2018chauvinist\u2019 and whether this is proper. Biomedical\ndiscussions are in large part defined by what they exclude from\ndiscussion. Curiously, there are two sides to the coin of biological\nchauvinism: one that directly supports the biomedical framework and\none that challenges it. Both help shed light on the relationship\nbetween biology and medicine.\n\nBroadbent (2009) uses the helpful term, \u201cbiological\nchauvinism\u201d to describe the way that biomedicine actively\nexcludes consideration of entities and processes that don\u2019t fit\ninto its worldview: \u201ca refusal to countenance causes of ill\nhealth that are not biological\u201d (Broadbent 2009: 305).\nBiological chauvinists might appeal to ontological or epistemic\ncommitments, e.g., the assumption that knowledge of the body is\nnothing but knowledge of organic chemical processes, and any processes\nnot clearly reducible to such terms are not yet worthy of being given\nfull consideration. But the strongest case for this chauvinism rests\nmore on pragmatic grounds than on such philosophical assumptions.\nBiomedicine has built itself into a massive global institution and\nresearch enterprise while operating under that assumption (to repeat\nKrieger\u2019s phrasing from\n Section 1.1,\n the assumption is that \u201cthe domain of disease and its causes is\nrestricted to solely biological, chemical, and physical\nphenomena\u201d (Krieger 2011: 130)). This is a powerful argument,\nthough it cuts both ways;\n Section 5\n discusses critiques attempting to undercut the value of what\nbiomedicine has indeed built while operating under that approach.\n\nOn the other side of the coin, \u201cbiochauvinism\u201d is the term\napplied to the view that there is something philosophically unique\nabout biological organisms\u2014due to their basic nature and/or the\nlimitations of human knowledge\u2019s access to them\u2014that makes\nthem the biological world fundamentally unlike the rest of the world\n(Wolfe 2015). Vitalism\u2014the view that life has some animating\nentity (along the lines of spirit) that animates matter into a living\nbeing\u2014is one form of such biochauvinism (Wolfe 2015). Another\nform of biochauvinism is the use of phenomenology to assert that human\nlived experience partly operates within a space-time context that is\ndifferent from that of a rock (Wolfe 2015). Wolfe finds that sort of\nview inside the influential phenomenological work of\n Maurice Merleau-Ponty\n (Wolfe 2015) (See\n Section 5\n on phenomenology). Thus there are two rather opposite senses in which\nwe can chauvinistically hold that the biological world is special:\n\n a specialness through what life excludes (medicine is\nnothing but applied biology) or \n a specialness through what life includes (an intangible\nvital spirit; a unique frame of time and space). \n\n\nVersion (1) of biomedicine is consistent with biomedicine and version\n(2) generally is not. The fact that the valorizing of biology can cut\nboth ways helps to show, though, that biomedicine has staked out a\nsort of middle ground by insisting that understanding health and\nmedicine is accomplished through understanding the innumerable\nsubtleties of biological processes and substances, but that those\nbiological processes and substances must not be so subtle or\nmysterious as to become untethered from properties and processes\ncondoned by physics and chemistry.\n\nPut another way, the biomedical framework of the body can be\nunderstood by considering what it excludes: spirit, vitality, and any\nother entity or property unknown to mainstream physicists or chemists.\nThe concept\n Physicalism\n is closely related, but the term is perhaps not a perfect fit since\nit has taken on conceptual connotations and baggage through its use by\nanalytic philosophers of metaphysics. The connection is that in the\npsychological biosciences, the \u201chard problem of\nconsciousness\u201d looms over everything: \n\n\nIt is widely agreed that experience arises from a physical basis, but\nwe have no good explanation of why and how it so arises. Why should\nphysical processing give rise to a rich inner life at all? It seems\nobjectively unreasonable that it should, and yet it does. (Chalmers\n1995) \n\n\nWhile the human mind and consciousness attract a special sense of awe,\nthe hard problem of consciousness is not all that different from the\nproblems facing attempts to make sense of the patient as a whole.\nPatients live; their bodies function every second of the day,\nvia an astounding series of interconnected processes. It stretches the\nimagination to think that a vital spirit or such is giving unity to\neach life (human or non-); it stretches the imagination in another way\nto think that we humans are simply skin bags of chemical\nreactions.\n",
