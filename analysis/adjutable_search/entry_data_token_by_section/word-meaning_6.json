    "main_text": "Philosophy of Language\n3. Philosophy of Language\n\nIn this section we shall review some semantic and metasemantic\ntheories in analytic philosophy that bear on how lexical meaning\nshould be conceived and described. We shall follow a roughly\nchronological order. Some of these theories, such as Carnap\u2019s\ntheory of meaning postulates and Putnam\u2019s theory of stereotypes,\nhave a strong focus on lexical meaning, whereas others, such as\nMontague semantics, regard it as a side issue. However, such negative\nviews form an equally integral part of the philosophical debate on\nword meaning.\n",
