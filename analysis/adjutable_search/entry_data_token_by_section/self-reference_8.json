    "main_text": "Solving the paradoxes\n3. Solving the paradoxes\n\nThe present section takes a look at how to solve\u2014or rather,\ncircumvent\u2014the paradoxes. To solve or circumvent a paradox one\nhas to weaken some of the assumptions leading to the contradiction. It\nis very difficult to choose which assumptions to weaken, since each of\nthe explicitly stated assumptions underlying a paradox appears to be\n\u201cobviously true\u201d\u2014otherwise it would not qualify as\na paradox. Below we will take a look at the most influential\napproaches to solving the paradoxes.\n\nSo far the presentation has been structured according to type of\nparadox, that is, the semantic, set-theoretic and epistemic paradoxes\nhave been dealt with separately. However, it has also been\ndemonstrated that these three types of paradoxes are similar in\nunderlying structure, and it has been argued that a solution to one\nshould be a solutions to all (the principle of uniform solution).\nTherefore, in the following the presentation will be structured not\naccording to type of paradox but according to type of solution. Each\ntype of solution considered in the following can be applied to any of\nthe paradoxes of self-reference, although in most cases the\nconstructions involved were originally developed with only one type of\nparadox in mind.\n",
