    "main_text": "Two Types of Simulation Processes || Low-Level Simulation Processes\n3.2 Low-Level Simulation Processes\n\nLow-level simulation processes are cognitive processes with these\nfeatures: (a*) they are typically unconscious, automatic, and\nstimulus-driven; (b) they satisfy\n PROC,\n that is, they are implemented by the reuse of a certain\ncognitive mechanism, C, and their output states\nresemble the output states generated by the use of C.\nWhat cognitive processes are, according to ST, instances of low-level\nsimulation? The answer can be given in two words: mirroring processes.\nClarifying what these two words mean, however, will take some\ntime.\n\nThe story begins at the end of the 1980s in Parma, Italy, where the\nneuroscientist Giacomo Rizzolatti and his team were investigating the\nproperties of the neurons in the macaque monkey ventral premotor\ncortex. Through single-cell recording experiments, they discovered\nthat the activity of neurons in the area F5 is correlated with\ngoal-directed motor actions and not with particular movements\n(Rizzolatti et al. 1988). For example, some F5 neurons fire when the\nmonkey grasps an object, regardless of whether the monkey uses the\nleft or the right hand. A plausible interpretation of these results is\nthat neurons in monkey area F5 encode motor intentions (i.e.,\nthose intentions causing and guiding actions like reaching, grasping,\nholding, etc.) and not mere kinematic instructions (i.e.,\nthose representations specifying the fine-grained motor details of an\naction). (In-depth philosophical analyses of the notion of motor\nintention can be found in: Brozzo forthcoming; Butterfill &\nSinigaglia 2014; Pacherie 2000). This was an already interesting\nresult, but it was not what the Parma group became famous for. Rather,\ntheir striking discovery happened a few years later, helped by\nserendipity. Researchers were recording the activity of F5 neurons in\na macaque monkey performing an object-retrieval task. In between\ntrials, the monkey stood still and watched an experimenter setting up\nthe new trial, with microelectrodes still measuring the monkey\u2019s\nbrain activity. Surprisingly, some of the F5 neurons turned out to\nfire when the monkey saw the experimenter grasping and\nplacing objects. This almost immediately led to new experiments, which\nrevealed that a portion of F5 neurons not only fire when the monkey\nperforms a certain goal-directed motor action (say, bringing a piece\nof food to the mouth), but also when it sees another agent performing\nthe same (type of) action (di Pellegrino et al. 1992; Gallese et al.\n1996; Rizzolatti et al. 1996). For this reason, these neurons were\naptly called \u201cmirror neurons\u201d, and it was\nproposed that they encode motor intentions both during action\nexecution and action observation (Rizzolatti & Sinigaglia 2007,\nforthcoming). Later studies found mirror neurons also in the macaque\nmonkey inferior parietal lobule (Gallese et al. 2002), which together\nwith the ventral premotor cortex constitutes the monkey cortical\nmirror neuron circuit (Rizzolatti & Craighero 2004).\n\nSubsequent evidence suggested that an action mirror\nmechanism\u2014that is, a cognitive mechanism that gets\nactivated both when an individual performs a certain goal-directed\nmotor action and when she sees another agent performing the same\naction\u2014also exists in the human brain (for reviews, see\nRizzolatti & Craighero 2004, and Rizzolatti & Sinigaglia\nforthcoming). In fact, it appears that there are mirror\nmechanisms in the human brain outside the action domain as well:\na mirror mechanism for disgust (Wicker et al. 2003), one for pain\n(Singer at al. 2004; Avenanti et al. 2005), and one for touch\n(Blakemore et al. 2005). Given the variety of mirror mechanisms, it is\nnot easy to give a definition that fits them all. Goldman (2008b) has\nquite a good one though, and we will draw from it: a cognitive\nmechanism is a mirror mechanism if and only if it gets activated both\nwhen an individual undergoes a certain mental event\nendogenously and when she perceives a sign that\nanother individual is undergoing the same (type of) mental event. For\nexample, the pain mirror mechanism gets activated both when\nindividuals experience \u201ca painful stimulus and \u2026 when\nthey observe a signal indicating that [someone else] is receiving a\nsimilar pain stimulus\u201d (Singer et al. 2004: 1157).\n\nHaving introduced the notions of mirror neuron and mirror mechanism,\nwe can define the crucial notion of this section: mirroring\nprocess. We have seen that mirror mechanisms can get activated in\ntwo distinct modes: (i) endogenously; (ii) in the perception mode. For\nexample, my action mirror mechanism gets endogenously activated when I\ngrasp a mug, while it gets activated in the perception mode when I see\nyou grasping a mug. Following again Goldman (2008b), let us say that a\ncognitive process is a mirroring process if and only if it is\nconstituted by the activation of a mirror mechanism in the\nperception mode. For example, what goes on in my brain when I see\nyou grasping a mug counts as a mirroring process.\n\nNow that we know what mirroring processes are, we can return to our\ninitial problem\u2014i.e., whether they are low-level simulation\nprocesses (remember that a cognitive process is a low-level simulation\nprocess if and only if: (a*) it is typically unconscious, automatic,\nand stimulus-driven; (b) it satisfies\n PROC).\n For reasons of space, we will focus on disgust mirroring only.\n\nWicker et al. (2003) carried out an fMRI study in which participants\nfirst observed videos of disgusted facial expressions and subsequently\nunderwent a disgust experience via inhaling foul odorants. It turned\nout that the same neural area\u2014the left anterior\ninsula\u2014that was preferentially activated during the experience\nof disgust was also preferentially activated during the observation of\nthe disgusted facial expressions. These results indicate the existence\nof a disgust mirror mechanism. Is disgust mirroring\n(the activation of the disgust mirror mechanism in the perception\nmode) a low-level simulation process? Simulation Theorists answer in\nthe affirmative.\n\nHere is why disgust mirroring satisfies (a*): the process is\nstimulus-driven: it is sensitive to certain perceptual\nstimuli (disgusted facial expressions); it is automatic; and\nit is typically unconscious (even though its output, i.e.,\n\u201cmirrored disgust\u201d, is sometimes conscious). What about\ncondition (b)? Presumably, the primary (evolutionary) function of the\ndisgust mechanism is to produce a disgust response to spoiled food,\ngerms, parasites etc. (Rozin et al. 2008). In the course of evolution,\nthis mechanism could have been subsequently co-opted to also get\nactivated by the perception (of a sign) that someone else is\nexperiencing disgust, in order to facilitate social learning of food\npreferences (Gari\u00e9py et al. 2014). If this is correct, then\ndisgust mirroring is implemented by the reuse of the disgust\nmechanism (by employing this mechanism for a function different than\nits primary one). Moreover, the output of disgust mirroring\nresembles the genuine experience of disgust in at least two\nsignificant respects: first, both mental states have the same neural\nbasis; second, when conscious, they share a similar phenomenology.\nAccordingly, (b) is satisfied. By putting all this together,\nSimulation Theorists conclude that disgust mirroring is a low-level\nsimulation process, and mirrored disgust is a simulated mental state\n(Goldman 2008b; Barlassina 2013)\n",
