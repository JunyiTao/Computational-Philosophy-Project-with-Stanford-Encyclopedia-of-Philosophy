    "main_text": "The Second Period: An Encyclopedia of Philosophy || Theology\n7. Cicero and Bernard Williams\n\nThere is no space here to explore in any detail the question of\nCicero\u2019s later reception. The influence of his philosophical\napproach on his great eighteenth-century successor, David Hume,\nparticularly in matters of theology and religion, is, however,\nwell-documented (see e.g. Fosl 1994, Stuart-Buttle 2020). So it seems\nappropriate instead to juxtapose that approach, albeit briefly, with\nthe work of one of the most noted Anglophone philosophers of the\ntwentieth century, Bernard Williams. Insofar as there are discernible\npoints of contact between the two thinkers, readers may be in a better\nposition to \u2018place\u2019 Cicero\u2019s philosophical project\nwhich, in its context of Roman politics and Hellenistic philosophical\ndebate, is liable to appear a little recondite to contemporary\neyes.\n\nLike Williams, then, Cicero engages deeply with his philosophical\npredecessors not principally as a historical exercise but as a\ncreative way of doing, and communicating, philosophy. Like Williams,\nhe is concerned to explore the scope and limits of philosophical\ntheory, especially ethical theory, in relation to the character of\nlived human experience. Both thinkers take the view that theory tends\nto fall short in accounting for how one should live in practical\ncontexts and for the place of integrity in an agent\u2019s life. Each\ncombines a belief in the power of philosophy to illuminate with a\nmarked scepticism about some of the claims that philosophy makes for\nitself. Not unconnectedly, the two thinkers show great care in the way\nthey write philosophy; both evince a distaste for technicality for its\nown sake.\n\nIt is an irony in the history of philosophy that Williams himself,\nduring a discussion of ancient scepticism, refers to Cicero, in\npassing, as a \u2018third-rate\u2019 thinker (2006, 33). If the\naffinities with Williams sketched here are anywhere near the mark,\nreaders may be motivated to explore, by engaging with Cicero\u2019s\nphilosophical work themselves, whether that verdict is entirely\njust.\n",
