    "main_text": "What is Moral Theory? What is Bioethics?\n1. What is Moral Theory? What is Bioethics?\n\nThe question of the relation between moral theory and bioethics is\nmade difficult by a number of factors, not the least of which is the\nabsence of any one account of what constitutes philosophical theory.\nThere are, of course, the standard moral theories of introduction to\nmoral philosophy\u2014consequentialism, deontology, and virtue\nethics. And we also speak of mid-level theories, such as moral\nprinciplism and casuistry, though the extent to which such approaches\nare strictly speaking theoretical is somewhat unsettled. What do we\nmean by moral theory? What characterizes an approach to moral\nphilosophy and bioethics as theoretical? Add to such questions the\nfact that bioethics itself is not a monolithic discipline, and our\ntopic is complicated right from the start.\n",
