    "main_text": "Theories of Attention || Coherence Theories\n2.3 Coherence Theories\n\nThe view that the function of attention is the management of\nlimitations in the brain\u2019s information processing capacity has\nbeen an orthodox one among psychologists since Donald Broadbent\nintroduced it in the nineteen fifties, but it has sometimes been\ncalled into question. The theories of attention proposed by\nphilosophers have tended not to endorse any straightforward version of\nthe capacity-limitation view, and there are empirical reasons to think\nthat the simplest versions of such a view are mistaken. In the\nnineteen seventies Ulric Neisser and his collaborators carried out a\nseries of experiments showing that, when appropriately trained, a\nsubject can perform two attention-involving tasks concurrently,\nwithout much interference between them (Hirst et al., 1980,\nNeisser, 1976). Neisser interpreted these experiments as suggesting\nthat, insofar as there is a bottleneck that attention is needed to\nmanage, it must often be a bottleneck in behavioural coordination,\nrather than in information processing capacity. Simple bodily\nlimitations are what prevent us from looking in two directions at one\ntime, or from throwing a ball and writing with the same hand.\nNeisser\u2019s suggestion was that in many cases cognitive processing\nwas selective, not as a result of limitations in processing capacity,\nbut only in so far as such bodily limitations required it to be.\n\nIn two papers from 1987, authored individually but published in the\nsame volume, Odmar Neumann and Alan Allport developed a similar idea.\nWhereas Neisser emphasized the constraints that are imposed on\ncognition by the need to manage a single body, Neumann and Allport\nboth emphasized the constraints that are placed on cognition by the\nneed to maintain a coherent course of goal-directed action. They\ndescribe their position as a \u2018selection-for-action\u2019\ntheory.\n\nIf we think of \u2018action\u2019 as here referring to bodily\nbehaviour then the selection-for-action theory is very similar to\nNeisser\u2019s view. But Neumann and Allport\u2019s point retains\nits force if we extend the notion of action to include deliberate\nmental activities, such as puzzle-solving, for which no bodily\nlimitations are in play. There is here an \u201canalogy between\npractical and theoretical and activity\u201d, which was noted in an\n1891 paper by G. F. Stout:\n\nThinking is action directed towards intellectual ends. Intellectual\nends are attained by an appropriate combination of movements of\nattention just as practical ends are attained by an appropriate\ncombination of movements of the body. If, therefore, we desire to\nexplain the process of Thinking, we must clearly determine the nature\nof active Attention. (Stout, 1891, p. 23)\n\n\nAs Stout and the later generations of action-oriented theorists\nindicate, the need to select among several possible sources of\ninformation, and to select among several possible things that might be\ndone with the information that has then been selected, is a\ncharacteristic of almost all deliberately executed thoughts and\nactions, whether those actions are bodily or intellectual. This\nubiquitous need for selectivity has been emphasized in a series of\nworks by Wayne Wu, where it is referred to as the \u201cmany many\nproblem\u201d(Wu, 2011a, 2014, 2019).\n\nIn Wu\u2019s handling of it, the idea that Neumann and Allport\nemphasized becomes part of a larger attempt to understand the\nessential connections between attention and agency (Wu, 2011b). For\nWu, attention\u2019s role in action is more fundamental than its role\nin perception. Stout is not the only precedent for this idea. The same\nconnection was noted by William James when he claimed that\n\u201cVolition is nothing but attention\u201d, (see Section\n 1.5,\n above). As with these earlier authors, Wu\u2019s point is not just\nthat, by treating attention as a purely perceptual phenomenon, we\nignore many of its other instances. Instead Wu wants to suggest that\nany division we might attempt to draw between perceptual attention and\nthe attentional selectivity required by agency would be an artificial\none. Even the involuntary capture of attention by perceptually salient\nstimuli should, Wu thinks, be understood as involving a kind of\nreadiness to act on the things to which we involuntarily attend\n(op cit, \u00a73). Wu\u2019s selection-for-action theory of\nattention is therefore intended as a step towards a unification of our\nphilosophical account of ourselves as agents and our philosophical\naccount of ourselves as perceivers.\n\nAccording to selection-for-action type views, the function of\nattention is not the management of capacity limitations. It is,\ninstead, the management of capacity excess. It is because we\ncan process multiple stimuli that we can be distracted by them, and\nbecause we can be distracted by them, not because we cannot process\nthem, that we need mechanisms of attention to provide selectivity and\nfocus. Attention, on this view, serves to lend coherence to, and to\nprevent interference between, the activity of several components in a\nsystem that has the capacity to handle far more stimuli than those\npertaining to the subject\u2019s current task. Such a view contrasts\nsharply with Broadbent\u2019s conception of attentional selectivity\nas capacity-bottleneck management.\n",
