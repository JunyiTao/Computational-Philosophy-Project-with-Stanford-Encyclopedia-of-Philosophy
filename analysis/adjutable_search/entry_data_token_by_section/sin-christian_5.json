    "main_text": "Sin as Disposition\n3. Sin as Disposition\n\nIn addition to being a category of action, sin can also be understood\nas an inclination or disposition to engage in sinful action. As\nPlantinga puts in,\n\n\nsin is also and perhaps primarily an affective disorder or\nmalfunction. Our affections are skewed, directed to the wrong objects;\nwe love and hate the wrong things. Instead of seeking first the\nkingdom of God, I am inclined to seek first my own personal\nglorification and aggrandizement, bending all of my efforts toward\nmaking myself look good. Instead of loving God above all and my\nneighbor as myself, I am inclined to love myself above all and,\nindeed, to hate God and my neighbor. (Plantinga 2000: 208)\n\n\nThe relation between sinful acts and sinful dispositions is complex.\nHaving a sinful disposition can certainly make it easier to commit a\nparticular kind of sin (e.g., being gluttonous makes it easier for me\nto drink another coffee beyond what I should), but a sinful\ndisposition is neither necessary nor sufficient for committing a\nsinful act. It can\u2019t be necessary, given that the primal sin\nisn\u2019t explained by the presence of a sinful disposition. And it\ncan\u2019t be sufficient, since we don\u2019t do all the sinful\nactions that a vice disposes us towards.\n\nAs is also the case for examining individual acts of sin, a full\naccount of sinful dispositions will depend on one\u2019s larger\nnormative framework. Sinful dispositions understood as inclinations\ntowards certain kinds of sinful acts can be understood as disordered\ndispositions to not follow the natural law or divine comments, or\nwithin the framework of a Kantian-inspired deontological account. It\nis, however, perhaps most natural to think of such dispositions within\nthe general normative framework of virtue ethics as vices (J. Porter\n1997: 466; McCluskey 2017: 7). The vices, on this approach, are habits\nof the soul that are contrary to individuals\u2019 flourishing and\nare opposed to, or involve the privation of, a particular virtue.\nAccording to Colleen McCluskey (2017), Thomas Aquinas holds that only\nactions can be sinful, strictly speaking, while vices are bad habits\nwithout those dispositions being themselves sinful. There is long\ntradition within Christianity, however, of treating sin in terms of\ndispositions as well as actions. Today, in part because of the\ninfluence of ethicists such as Anscombe, Foot, Murdoch and MacIntyre,\nmany contemporary Christian philosophers and theologians draw on the\nmedieval virtue ethics tradition and its portrayal of vices as sinful\ndispositions.\n\nMuch of the relevant work on sinful dispositions focuses either on\nparticular categories of vice (e.g., vices opposed to the cardinal\nvirtues, or the seven capital vices) or on individual vices. (For\nexamples, see DeYoung 2020, Sweeney 2018, and McCluskey 2017.) As\nRebecca DeYoung notes, a common Christian response to vice is to\nconcentrate on sanctification, which is the change or transformation\nof character required to remove sinful dispositions (DeYoung 2020:\nviii; for different models of the nature of sanctification, see Alston\n1988, S. Porter & Rickabaugh 2018, and Yeo 2014.) Sanctification\nimportantly includes spiritual disciplines in the process of virtue\nformation (see DeYoung 2020 and Smith 2016).\n",
