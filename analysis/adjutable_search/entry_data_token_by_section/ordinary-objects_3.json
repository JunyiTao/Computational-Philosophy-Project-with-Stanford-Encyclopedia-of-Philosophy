    "main_text": "Against Conservative Ontologies || The Argument from Vagueness\n2.2 The Argument from Vagueness\n\nIt is natural to suppose that objects sometimes do, and other times do\nnot, compose a further object. When a hammer head is firmly affixed to\na handle, they compose something, namely, a hammer. When they\u2019re\non opposite ends of the room, they don\u2019t compose anything. The\nfollowing argument\u2014known as \u201cthe argument from\nvagueness\u201d\u2014purports to show that this natural assumption\nis mistaken.\n\n(AV1)\nIf some pluralities of objects compose something and others do\nnot, then it is possible for there to be a sorites series for\ncomposition.\n(AV2)\nAny such sorites series must contain either an exact cut-off or\nborderline cases of composition.\n(AV3)\nThere cannot be exact cut-offs in such sorites series.\n(AV4)\nThere cannot be borderline cases of composition.\n(AV5)\nSo, either every plurality of objects composes something or none\ndo.\n\n\nIf the argument is sound then either universalism or nihilism must be\ncorrect, though which of them is correct would have to be decided on\nindependent\n grounds.[15]\n\n\nA sorites series for composition is a series of cases running from a\ncase in which composition doesn\u2019t occur to a case in which\ncomposition does occur, where adjacent cases are extremely similar in\nall of the respects that one would ordinarily take to be relevant to\nwhether composition occurs (e.g., the spatial and causal relations\namong the objects in question). Understood in this way, AV1 should be\nunobjectionable. If it\u2019s true that the handle and head compose\nsomething only once the hammer is assembled, then a moment-by-moment\nseries of cases running from the beginning to the end of the assembly\nof the hammer would be just such a series. Premise AV2 looks trivial:\nany such series obviously must contain some transition from\ncomposition not occurring to composition occurring, and there either\nwill or won\u2019t be a determinate fact of the matter about where\nexactly that transition occurs in any given series.\n\nAV3 is plausible as well. If composition occurs in one case but not in\nanother, then surely there must be some explanation for why that is.\nIn other words, the facts about composition are not\n\u201cbrute\u201d. Yet the sorts of differences that one finds among\nadjacent cases in a sorites series for composition\u2014for instance,\nthat the handle and head are a fraction of a centimeter closer\ntogether in the one than in the other\u2014can\u2019t plausibly\nexplain why composition occurs in one case but not in the\n other.[16]\n\nCertain sorts of eliminativists are well positioned to resist AV3\nwithout having to accept that compositional facts are brute. Suppose,\nfor instance, that one accepts a view on which conscious beings are\nthe only composite objects. Such eliminativists will deny that there\nis a sorites series for composition running from the beginning to the\nend of the assembly process, since they will deny that anything is\ncomposed of the handle and head (or that there are a handle\nand head) even at the end of the series. Every sorites series for\ncomposition, by their lights, will have to run from a case involving a\nconscious being to one that doesn\u2019t. And assuming that that\nthere can\u2019t be borderline cases of consciousness, every such\nseries will contain a sharp cut-off with respect to the presence of\nthe additional subject of consciousness. This, in turn, is poised to\nexplain why composition occurs in the one case but not the\n other.[17]\n\n\nWhy, though, should anyone accept AV4? On the face of it, it seems\njust as clear that there can be borderline cases of composition (e.g.,\nwhen the hammer head is just beginning to be affixed to the handle) as\nit is that there can be borderline cases of redness and baldness. This\nis not, however, \u201cjust another sorites,\u201d to be blocked in\nwhichever way one blocks the sorites arguments in \u00a72.1.\nThat\u2019s because questions about when composition occurs look to\nbe intimately bound up with questions about how many objects exist.\nThis suggests the following line of argument in defense of AV4, no\nanalogue of which is available for other sorts of sorites\n arguments.[18]\n\n(AV6)\n If there can be borderline cases of composition, then it can be\nindeterminate how many objects exist.\n(AV7)\nIt cannot be indeterminate how many objects exist.\n(AV4)\nSo, there cannot be borderline cases of composition.\n\n\nTo see the motivation for AV6, notice that if the handle and head do\ncompose something then there are three things: the handle, the head,\nand a hammer. If they don\u2019t, then there are only two things: the\nhandle and head. And if it is vague whether they do, then it will be\nvague whether there are two things or three. As for AV7, notice that\none can specify how many objects there are using what would seem to be\nentirely precise vocabulary. For any finite number, one can produce a\n\u201cnumerical sentence\u201d saying that there are exactly that\nmany concrete objects. Here, for instance, is the numerical sentence\nfor two: \u2018\u2203x\u2203y(x\u2260y & Cx & Cy &\n\u2200z(Cz\u2192(x=z \u2228 y=z)))\u2019. (The restriction to\nconcreta ensures that numerical sentences aren\u2019t trivially false\nsimply on account of there being infinitely many numbers, sets, and so\nforth.) And since these numerical sentences contain no vague\nvocabulary, it would seem to follow that it cannot be indeterminate\nhow many objects there are.\n\nAV6 can be resisted by denying that composition affects the number of\nobjects in the way suggested. For instance, one might contend that\neven before the handle and head definitely come to compose something,\nthere exists an object\u2014a\n\u201cproto-hammer\u201d\u2014located in the region that the two of\nthem jointly occupy. The proto-hammer definitely exists, but it is a\nborderline case of composition: it is indeterminate whether the handle\nand head compose the proto-hammer or whether they instead compose\nnothing at all (in which case the proto-hammer has no\n parts).[19]\n\nAlternatively, one might resist AV7 by pinning the vagueness on the\nquantifiers in the numerical sentence. After all, what seems to be\nvague is whether the handle and head are everything that\nthere is and whether there is something other than\nthe handle and head. But it is difficult to see how the quantifiers\ncan be vague and, in particular, how their vagueness could be\naccounted for on the sort of standard, precisificational account of\nvagueness discussed in\n \u00a72.1.[20]\n\n",
