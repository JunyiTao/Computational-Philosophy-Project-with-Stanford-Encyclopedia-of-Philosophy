    "main_text": "Skepticism\n6. Skepticism\n\nOne of the hallmarks of Descartes\u2019 epistemological project is\nits obsession with refuting skepticism. Descartes begins his\nMeditations by entertaining the widest and most radical\ndoubts possible so that he can defeat them once and for all. Some\ncommentators have suggested that Malebranche\u2019s doctrine of\nVision in God is also designed to refute skepticism, at least\nconcerning our knowledge of the essence of material things, but in\nfact the relation of his epistemology to skepticism is more complex,\nand he is best read as aiming for something more modest. Although\nMalebranche is as obsessed as Descartes with finding the correct\nmethod for discovering the truth, nothing like the Cartesian method of\nuniversal doubt can be found in his writings. There is a very simple\nreason for this: Malebranche refuses to take seriously some of the\nmore radical forms of skepticism. He never doubts that certain types\nof knowledge are possible. The task of the doctrine of Vision in God\nthen is not to refute skepticism, but to show how such\nknowledge is possible. The problem with rival theories of cognition,\nespecially Descartes\u2019, is that they encourage skepticism and\nfail to account for the knowledge we clearly have.\n\nAt times, Descartes seems to allow that there are some truths \u2013\nsuch as the simple propositions of mathematics \u2013 that can never\nbe doubted, but in darker moods that carry the day he worries whether\nan omnipotent deceiver might beguile us even about these. Malebranche,\nhowever, is more impressed by Descartes\u2019 first inclination. That\nI exist, that I have various thoughts, and that twice two equals four\nare not subject to deception but are known by what Malebranche calls\n\u2018simple perception,\u2019 by which the mind \u2018perceives a\nsimple thing without any relation to anything else whatsoever\u2019\n(Search 1.2, OC 1:49; LO 7). He opposes simple perception to\nreasoning or inference: whereas the former consists in a direct or\nimmediate grasp of something, reasoning constitutes an indirect\napprehension and involves more than one mental act (Schmaltz 1996,\n24). Because of the latter, reasoning requires the use of memory,\nwhich is subject to error and deception:\n\n\nFor when we reason, the memory acts; and where there is memory, there\ncan be error, should there be some evil genius on whom we depend in\nour knowledge who amuses himself by deceiving us\u2026. [But] I am\nquite persuaded that he could not deceive me in my knowledge through\nsimple perception\u2026. For even if I should really suppose such a\nGod, a God as powerful as I can imagine, I feel that in this\nextravagant supposition I could not doubt that I am, or that twice two\nequals four, because I perceive these things through simple perception\nwithout the use of memory. (Search 6.2.6, OC 2:370; LO\n480\u20131)\n\n\nMalebranche does not quite say here why he thinks things known through\nsimple perception are impervious to the omnipotent-deceiver doubt,\nthough his examples provide some indication. Descartes himself had\nsaid that even a malicious demon could not make him doubt his own\nexistence, at least while he is presently attending to this\nquestion. Such doubts are self-defeating: if the demon deceives\nme about anything then I must exist in order to be deceived. Rather\nthan offering an explanation of this kind, Malebranche is content here\nsimply to report on his own psychological response to the\n\u2018extravagant supposition\u2019 of a deceiving God, which fails\nto instill doubts in him about such simple truths. This supposition,\nhowever, does cause him to doubt things that depend on inference and\nhere he is quite explicit that this is due to the fallibility of\nmemory.\n\nTo defeat doubts of the latter variety, Malebranche thinks, \u2018It\nis \u2026 necessary to know by simple perception and not by inference\nthat God is not a deceiver, because reasoning can always be mistaken\nif we assume God to be a deceiver\u2019 (ibid., OC 2:371; LO 481).\nMalebranche is indicating here his own analysis of, and solution to,\nthe infamous Cartesian Circle. As he sees it, the Circle results from\n\u2018ordinary proofs of the existence and the perfections of\nGod\u2019 that involve inferences and hence are subject to the very\ndoubts that their conclusions are designed to dispel. Since on his\nview, simple perceptions are not subject to doubts of this or any\nkind, the only way to defeat the omnipotent deceiver doubt is by\nestablishing that God exists and is perfectly benevolent from\n\u2018proofs\u2019 by simple perception. The term\n\u2018proofs\u2019 here may seem confusing, given\nMalebranche\u2019s distinction between simple perception and\ninference, but he uses it loosely to refer to his version of the\nontological \u2018argument,\u2019 where God\u2019s existence is\nestablished directly from the idea of an infinite or supremely perfect\nbeing. Malebranche thinks that one of the virtues of the doctrine of\nVision in God is that it provides such a proof by simple perception.\nRecall from our earlier discussion in section 4 that Malebranche\nthinks we have an infinite cognitive capacity; for example, we can\nthink of any one of an infinite number of geometrical figures. A\nprecondition for this capacity, he maintains, is that we be in\nconstant and immediate union with the idea of being in general, which\nwe then delimit in various ways when thinking \u2018square,\u2019\n\u2018circle,\u2019 etc. But the idea of being in general or the\ninfinite can\u2019t be in any finite thing such as our mind. It can\nonly be in God \u2013 more precisely, it can only be God\nhimself, for there can be only one infinite or all-encompassing\nbeing:\n\n\nwe can only apprehend the infinite in the infinite itself\u2026. For\nthe first principle of our knowledge is that nothingness is not\nperceptible, whence if follows that, if we think of the infinite, it\nmust exist. We also see that God is not a deceiver, because, knowing\nthat He is infinitely perfect and that the infinite cannot lack any\nperfection, we clearly see that He does not want to beguile\nus\u2026. (ibid., OC 2:372; LO 481\u20132)\n\n\nAlthough Malebranche sometimes refers to the \u2018idea\u2019 of\nGod, strictly speaking, \u2018The infinite is its own idea\u2019\n(Dialogue 2, OC 12:53; JS 23). And we can explain our infinite\ncognitive capacity only by our union with this infinite being, who\nmust therefore exist.\n\nIn addition to thinking that there are some truths that are impervious\nto doubt, Malebranche also has a different understanding of\nDescartes\u2019 principle that whatever one clearly and distinctly is\ntrue. Descartes maintains that when I clearly and distinctly perceive\nsomething my will is causally compelled to affirm it. So, for example,\nif I understand the proposition that five is the sum of two added to\nthree then I will spontaneously affirm its truth. But as one\ncommentator has noted, Malebranche has a normative, rather than a\ncausal-psychological conception, of clear and distinct perceptions\n(Lennon 2000). Reason \u2018obliges,\u2019 rather than causally\ncompels, my will to assent. Indeed, I can resist a clear and distinct\nperception, but only at the risk of \u2018feeling an inward pain and\nthe secret reproaches of reason\u2019 (Search 1.2, OC 1:55;\nLO 10). This is significant because it explains why Malebranche\nrefuses to take some forms of skepticism seriously: skepticism with\nrespect to things perceived through clear and distinct perceptions is\nsimply perverse, for it violates norms to which reason demands\nadherence (Lennon 2000, 19).\n\nSo far, we have seen that Malebranche is concerned to defeat some\nforms of skepticism and is contemptuous and dismissive of others.\nAlthough Vision in God plays a prominent role in defeating skepticism\nof the first variety, regarding inference, its more primary task is to\nexplain how knowledge is possible. This point is evident in some of\nthe demonstrations that Malebranche marshals in support of the\ndoctrine, which have the character of \u2018transcendental\narguments.\u2019 Transcendental arguments typically begin with some\nclaim about knowledge that is taken as given. The transcendental move\nthen involves showing that such knowledge is possible only if some\ncondition, or set of conditions, has been satisfied. We might view the\nArgument from Properties, discussed in section 3, as an example of\nsuch an argument. Malebranche argues that the condition for the\npossibility of knowledge of truths that are necessary, immutable, and\ncommon to all minds or intelligences is that we see all things in\nGod:\n\n\nNo one disagrees that all men can know the truth, and even the least\nenlightened of philosophers agree that man participates in a certain\nReason that they do not determine \u2026. I see, for example,\nthat twice two is four, and that my friend is to be valued more than\nmy dog; and I am certain that no one in the world does not see this as\nwell as I\u2026. There must, therefore, be a universal Reason that\nenlightens me and all other intelligences. For if the reason I consult\nwere not the same that answers the Chinese, it is clear that I could\nnot be as certain as I am that the Chinese see the same truths as I do.\n(Elucidation 10, OC 3:129; LO 613)\n\n\nMalebranche begins here by assuming that we have knowledge of\nmathematical and moral truths. The problem involves showing\nhow this knowledge is possible, and he resolves it by\nappealing to Vision in God. The Argument from Properties is not the\nonly demonstration in Malebranche\u2019s arsenal that has a\ntranscendental flavor. Indeed, one can view all of his positive\narguments for Vision in God, including those discussed in section 4,\nas constituting an over-arching transcendental argument. Viewed in\nthis way, each of the considerations that he puts forth are not so\nmuch separate arguments as they are separate conditions for the\npossibility of knowledge that only Vision in God can jointly\nsatisfy.\n\nMalebranche\u2019s primary objection to other theories of cognition,\nthen, is that they fail to satisfy these conditions and, in the case\nof Descartes\u2019 theory in particular, encourage the\nskeptic\u2019s claim that we lack knowledge. Descartes\u2019 very\nconception of ideas as perceptions, or modifications of finite minds,\nmakes it impossible to guarantee that they accurately represent their\nobjects:\n\n\nFor if our ideas were only our perceptions, if our modes were\nrepresentative, how would we know that things correspond to our ideas,\nsince God does not think, and consequently does not act, according to\nour perceptions but according to His own; and therefore He did not\ncreate the world according to our perceptions but in accordance with\nHis ideas, on its eternal model that He finds in His essence\n(Search 4.11, OC 2:99; LO 320).\n\n[T]o maintain that ideas that are eternal, immutable, and common to\nall intelligences, are only perceptions or momentary particular\nmodifications of the mind, is to establish Pyrrhonism and to make room\nfor the belief that what is moral or immoral is not necessarily so,\nwhich is the most dangerous error of all. (Elucidation 10, OC 3:140; LO\n620)\n\n\nAs discussed in section 3, Descartes insists that our ideas of\ngeometrical figures and the like are \u2018eternal\u2019 and\n\u2018immutable\u2019 (and Malebranche takes him also to hold that\nthey are \u2018common to all intelligences\u2019), but Malebranche\nwonders here how this can be possible if they are merely fleeting\nmodes of finite minds. To identify ideas with such modes suggests that\nthey are merely subjective representations that vary among perceivers,\nand whose correspondence to reality can never be established. It thus\ninvites skepticism (or \u2018Pyrrhonism,\u2019 an ancient form of\nskepticism, though here the term just means radical or universal\nskepticism) regarding our knowledge of the essences of created\nthings.\n\nAgain, the virtue of Vision in God is that rather than encouraging\nskepticism, it shows how knowledge is possible. If ideas are eternal\nand immutable realities in God that serve as his archetypes for\ncreation, then there is no problem about whether they conform to their\nobjects. On the contrary, created objects must conform to them:\n\n\nIt is certain that things conform to the idea that God has of them.\nFor since God created them, He can only have made them according to\nthe idea that He has of them. Now according to the opinion that I\nmaintain, the idea that I have of extension in length, breadth, and\ndepth is not a modification of my soul: it is eternal, immutable,\nnecessary, common to God and all intelligences, and this idea is the\nmodel of created extension from which all bodies are formed. I can\nthus affirm with truth of created extension what I see contained in\nthis uncreated idea. (OCM 9:925\u20136)\n\n",
