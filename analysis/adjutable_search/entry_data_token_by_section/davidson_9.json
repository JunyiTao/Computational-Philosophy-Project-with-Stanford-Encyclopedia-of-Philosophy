    "main_text": "Meaning and Truth || Language and Convention\n3.5 Language and Convention\n\nThe heart of a Davidsonian theory of interpretation is, of course, a\nTarskian truth theory. But a truth theory provides only the formal\nstructure on which linguistic interpretation is based: such a theory\nneeds to be embedded within a broader approach that looks to the\ninterconnections between utterances, other behaviour and attitudes; in\naddition, the application of such a theory to actual linguistic\nbehaviour must also take account of the dynamic and shifting character\nof such behaviour. This latter point is easily overlooked, but it\nleads Davidson to some important conclusions. Ordinary speech is full\nof ungrammatical constructions (constructions that may even be\nacknowledged to be ungrammatical by the speaker herself), incomplete\nsentences or phrases, metaphors, neologisms, jokes, puns and all\nmanner of phenomena that cannot be met simply by the application to\nutterances of a pre-existing theory for the language being spoken.\nLinguistic understanding cannot, then, be a matter simply of the\nmechanical application of a Tarski-like theory (although this is just\nwhat Davidson might be taken to suggest in the early essays). In\npapers such as \u2018A Nice Derangement of Epitaphs\u2019 (1986),\nDavidson addresses just this point, arguing that while linguistic\nunderstanding does indeed depend upon a grasp of the formal structure\nof a language, that structure always stands in need of modification in\nthe light of actual linguistic behaviour. Understanding a language is\na matter of continually adjusting interpretative presuppositions\n(presuppositions that are often not explicit) in accord with the\nutterances to be interpreted. Furthermore, this calls upon skills and\nknowledge (imagination, attentiveness to the attitudes and behaviour\nof others, knowledge of the world) that are not specifically\nlinguistic and that are part of a more general ability to get on in\nthe world and in relation to others \u2013 an ability that also\nresists any formal explication. In \u2018A Nice Derangement of\nEpitaphs\u2019, Davidson puts this point, in provocative fashion, by\nclaiming that \u2018there is no such thing as a language\u2019\n(adding the immediate qualification \u2018not if a language is\nanything like what many philosophers and linguists have\nsupposed\u2019). Put less provocatively, the essential point is that\nlinguistic conventions (and in particular linguistic conventions that\ntake the form of agreement over the employment of shared syntactic and\nsemantic rules), while they may well facilitate understanding, cannot\nbe the basis for such understanding.\n\nDavidson\u2019s denial of rule-based conventions as having a founding\nrole in linguistic understanding, together with his emphasis on the\nway in which the capacity for linguistic understanding must be seen as\npart as part of a more general set of capacities for getting on in the\nworld, underlie Davidson\u2019s much-discussed account of metaphor\nand related features of language (see \u2018What Metaphors\nMean\u2019 [1978b]). Davidson rejects the idea that metaphorical\nlanguage can be explained by reference to any set of rules that govern\nsuch meaning. Instead it depends on using sentences with their\n\u2018literal\u2019 or standard meanings in ways that give rise to\nnew or unexpected insights, and just as there are no rules by which we\ncan work out what a speaker means when she utters an ungrammatical\nsentence, makes a pun or otherwise uses language in a way that\ndiverges from the norm, so there are no rules that govern the grasp of\nmetaphor.\n",
