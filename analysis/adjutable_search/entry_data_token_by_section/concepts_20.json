    "main_text": "Concepts and conceptual analysis || Attractions of conceptual analysis\n5.2 Objections to conceptual analysis\n\nMany philosophers who are opposed to conceptual analysis identify\ntheir approach as being naturalistic (e.g., Devitt 1996,\nKornblith 2002, Papineau 2013; see also the entry\n naturalism).\n A common theme of this work is that philosophy is supposed to be\ncontinuous with science and that philosophical theories are to be\ndefended on largely explanatory grounds, not on the basis of a priori\narguments that appeal to intuition. Accordingly, perceived\ndifficulties with conceptual analysis provide arguments for\nnaturalism.\n\nOne such argument centers around the failures of the classical theory\nof concepts. Earlier, in\n Section 2,\n we noted that paradigmatic conceptual analyses require concepts to\nhave classical structure, an assumption that is increasingly difficult\nto maintain. For this reason, a number of philosophers have expressed\nskepticism about the viability of conceptual analysis as a\nphilosophical method (e.g., Ramsey 1998, Stich 1992). Others, however,\nhave called into question the connection between conceptual analysis\nand definitions (Chalmers & Jackson 2001).\n\nAnother objection to conceptual analysis is that the intuitions that\nphilosophers routinely rely upon may not be shared. Anyone who teaches\nphilosophy certainly knows that half the time students have the\n\u201cwrong intuitions\u201d. But who are we to say that they are\nwrong? And given that people disagree about their intuitions, these\ncan hardly be treated as objective data (Cummins 1998).\n\nThings become even more interesting if we branch out to other\ncultures. In a preliminary study of East Asian vs. Western intuitions,\nJonathan Weinberg, Shaun Nichols, & Stephen Stich (2001) found\nthat East Asians often have the \u201cwrong intuitions\u201d\nregarding variations on classic philosophical thought experiments,\nincluding Gettier-type thought experiments (though see Machery et al\n2017 for evidence that some of these intuitions may in fact be\nuniversal). At the very least, this work suggests that philosophers\nshould be cautious about moving from their own intuitions to claims\nabout the proper analysis of a concept.\n\nWhat\u2019s more, the possibility of cultural diversity raises a\ntroubling question for philosophers who want to establish normative\nclaims on the basis of analyses of concepts, such as the concept of\njustification. Suppose, for example, that East Asian culture offers a\ndifferent concept of justification than the one that is embedded in\nWestern commonsense thought (assuming for sake of argument that there\nis a single concept of justification in each culture). In addition,\nsuppose that East Asians employ different inferential practices than\nour own and that their practices do a fair job of conforming to their\nconcept of justification and that ours do a fair job of conforming to\nour own. On what basis, then, are we to compare and evaluate these\ndiffering practices? Does it really make sense to say that ours are\nsuperior on the ground that they conform better to our\nconcept of justification? Wouldn\u2019t this just be a form of\nepistemic prejudice? After all, the question arises whether, given the\ntwo concepts of justification, ours is the one that ought to be used\nfor performing normative epistemic evaluations (Stich 1990; for\nfurther discussion see Williamson 2005, Sosa 2009, Stich 2009,\nWeinberg, Nichols, & Stich 2001, Weinberg et al. 2010).\n\nThe critique of traditional philosophical analysis has also generated\nproposals for various types of normative, revisionary projects.\nInstead of asking which cases are or are not covered by a concept,\nthey ask how a concept should be modified or what new concept should\nbe adopted in its place, given the practical context in which the\nconcept is used\u2014for example, given the goal of promoting social\nequality (Haslanger 2012, Cappelen 2018).\n\nMuch is at stake in the debate between conceptual analysts and\nnaturalists, and it is likely to be a central topic in the theory of\nconcepts for the foreseeable future.\n",
