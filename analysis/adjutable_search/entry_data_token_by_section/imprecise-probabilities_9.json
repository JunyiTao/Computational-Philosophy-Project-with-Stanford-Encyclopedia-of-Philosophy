If we endorse\nsome kind of connection between known objective chances and\nbelief\u2014for example, a principle of direct inference or Lewis\u2019\nPrincipal Principle (Lewis\n1986)\u2014then we might have an additional reason to endorse\nimprecise probabilism. It seems to be a truth universally acknowledged\nthat chances ought to be probabilities, but it is a\n\u201ctruth\u201d for which very little argument has been\noffered. For example, Schaffer (2007)\nmakes obeying the probability axioms one of the things required in\norder to play the \u201cchance role\u201d, but offers no argument\nthat this should be the case.  Joyce says \u201csome have held\nobjective chances are not probabilities. This seems unlikely, but\nexplaining why would take us too far\nafield\u201d (2009: 279,\nfn.17). Various other discussions of chance\u2014for example\nin statistical mechanics (Loewer 2001; Frigg\n2008) or \u201cHumean\nchance\u201d (Lewis 1986,\n1994)\u2014take for granted that chances should be precise and\nprobabilistic (Dardashti et al. 2014 is\nan exception). Obviously things are confused by the use of the concept\nof chance as a way of interpreting probability theory. There is,\nhowever, a perfectly good pre-theoretic notion of chance: this is what\nprobability theory was originally invented to reason about, after\nall. This pre-theoretic chance still seems like the sort of thing that\nwe should apportion our belief to, in some sense. And there is very\nlittle argument that chances must always be probabilities. If the\nchances were nonprobabilistic in a particular way, one might argue\nthat your credences ought to be nonprobabilistic in the same way. What\nform a chance-coordination norm should take if chances and credences\nwere to have non-probabilistic formal structures is currently an open\nproblem.\nI want to give a couple of examples of this idea. First consider\nsome physical process that doesn\u2019t have a limiting frequency but has a\nfrequency that varies, always staying within some interval. This would\nbe a process that is chancy, but fairly predictable. It might be that\nthe best description of such a system is to just put bounds on its\nrelative frequency. Such processes have been studied using IP\nmodels (Kumar and Fine 1985; Grize and Fine\n1987; Fine 1988), and have been discussed as a potential source\nof imprecision in credence (H\u00e1jek and Smithson\n2012). A certain kind of non-standard understanding of a\nquantum-mechanical event leads naturally to upper probability\nmodels (Suppes and Zanotti 1991; Hartmann and\nSuppes 2010). John Norton has discussed the limits of\nprobability theory as a logic of induction, using an example which, he\nclaims, admits no reasonable probabilistic\nattitude (Norton 2007, 2008a,b). One\nmight hope that IP offers an inductive logic along the lines Norton\nsketches. Norton himself has expressed scepticism on this\nline (Norton 2007),\nalthough Ben\u00e9treau-Dupin (2015) has defended IP as a candidate\nsystem for Norton\u2019s project.\nFinally, particular views on vagueness might well prompt a rethinking of the formal structure of chance (Bradley 2016).\n",
