    "main_text": "Theory Accommodation and Change\n4. Theory Accommodation and Change\n\nOne meta-scientific issue raised by these macroevolutionary disputes\nis just how much a scientific theory can flex and change before it\neither becomes a different theory altogether, or it becomes a bad\nscientific theory (via too much of what Popper [1974] would call\nad hoc revisionism).\n\nAs an illustrative example, consider punctuated equilibrium, which has\ncertainty been articulated in many and varying ways. The two initial\npublications by Eldredge (1971) and Eldredge and Gould (1972) are\nundoubtedly the founding ones, but there are other crucial moments in\nthe development of the theory (e.g., Gould & Eldredge 1977, 1983,\n1986, 1993; Eldredge & Gould 1988; Gould 2002). At times the\nshifting nature of PE has been a target of criticism (e.g., Levinton\n1986; Coyne & Charlesworth 1997; see Eckhardt 1986 for a\nparticularly entertaining visit from \u201cthe shade of Francis\nGalton\u201d).\n\nAnother dynamic theoretical dimension of PE, hierarchical theory, and\nthe like is how radically these scientific notions are\nperceived\u2014even by their own creators. In 1982, for instance,\nGould first asked and then answered: \n\n\nWhat would a fully elaborated, hierarchically based evolutionary\ntheory be called? It would neither be Darwinism, as usually\nunderstood, nor a smoothly continuous extension of Darwinism, for it\nviolates directly the fundamental reductionist tradition embodied in\nDarwin\u2019s focus on organisms as units of selection. (1982: 386)\n\n\n\nBut in 2002, Gould wrote \n\n\nI do believe that the Darwinian framework, and not just the\nfoundation, persists in the emerging structure of a more adequate\nevolutionary theory. (2002:3) \n\n\nHe devoted much of the extensive efforts of his Structure of\nEvolutionary Theory to defending an interpretation of Darwinian\nevolutionary theory as resting on a revisable \u201ctripod of\nnecessary support\u201d (Gould 2002: 586)\u2014one whose three\ncritical supports were challenged by proposed expansions to\nevolutionary theory, but which nonetheless could be buttressed via\nintegration with these challenges, rather than replacement by them. In\nshort, the later Gould argues that Darwinian evolution traditionally\nemphasizes organismic selection, adaptationism, and extrapolationism;\nthat punctuated equilibria, stabilizing selection, and species\nselection challenge the first of these supports, developmental and\nother constraints challenge the second, and major evolutionary\ntransitions challenge the third; but that all three of these\nchallenges can be accommodated by a revised but still Darwinian\nconception of evolutionary theory.\n\nNote that efforts to retain (or reject) the Darwinian label show up in\nother contexts as well\u2014for instance, in discussions of\nadaptationism (e.g., Gould & Lewontin 1979) and the neutral theory\nof molecular evolution (Dietrich 1994). Darwin himself declared that\n\u201cHe who rejects these views [his] on the nature of the\ngeological record, will rightly reject my whole theory\u201d (1859\n[1964: 342]). Whether or not Darwin\u2019s emphatic claim is correct\nis still an open question. Additional philosophical resources on\ntheoretical and conceptual change in science include but are by no\nmeans limited to Kuhn (1962), LaPorte (2004), and M. Wilson\n(2006).\n",
