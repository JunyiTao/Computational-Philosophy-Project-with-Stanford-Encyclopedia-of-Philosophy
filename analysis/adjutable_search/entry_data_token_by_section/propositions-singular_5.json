Temporal Problems for Singular Propositions\n Singular propositions are a combination of the abstract and\nconcrete, which leads to problems. The modal problem arises because,\non the one hand, there are reasons to think that all propositions, as\nabstract objects, exist necessarily, but, on the other hand, it is\nhighly intuitive that ordinary individuals might not have existed and\nothers could have existed, in which case the singular propositions\ncontaining them as constituents exist contingently. The solutions to\nthis problem discussed above involve denying that there are singular\npropositions, denying that ordinary objects are contingent existents,\nor denying that propositions are necessary existents. The temporal\nproblems we shall consider in this section arise because ordinary\nindividuals change over time, including coming into and going out of\nexistence. Propositions, on the other hand, are usually taken to be\neternal objects \u2014 things that do not change over time and exist\nat all times.\n\n\nConsider the following proposition. \n(9) Socrates existed but does not exist.\n\n(9) seems like a true singular proposition, as Socrates died long\nago. How then is (9) true, as its constituent Socrates does not exist\nand so it does not exist? This is clearly the temporal analog of the\nmodal problem discussed in the previous section. Moreover, if (9) is a\nsingular proposition, then what is the constituent of (9) like? How\nold is it? Is it sitting or standing? It seems absurd to say that the\nage of a constituent of a proposition is thus and so and that it is\nsitting and not standing, yet if Socrates himself is a constituent of\n(9), then he must be a determinate age and must be in a determinate\nposition; no person exists without being a determinate age and being\nin a position. Our second set of questions also have modal analogs and\nit may help clarify the issues to present them before exploring\nanswers to the temporal problems. \n\nBush in fact has two arms, but he might have had only one. But then if\nBush himself is a constituent of the proposition that Bush has two\narms, he must either have exactly two arms or exactly one arm, it\nwould seem, as no person exists without having a determinate number of\narms. But neither answer seems satisfying. This issue is related to\nproblems of temporary and accidental intrinsics. (See his (1986,\nchapter 4).)\n In the next two sub-sections we consider each set of issues in\nturn.\n6.1. Temporal Problems for Singular Propositions: Quantitative Change\n\nIn section 5 we considered the modal version of the first set of\nissues and saw how one's account is connected to\nlarger issues in the metaphysics of modality. Similarly, one's\naccount of the temporal problems is connected to larger issues in the\nmetaphysics of time. Recall the possibilist solution from section\n5. The temporal analog of possibilism is eternalism, according to\nwhich what exists at a time is but a proper subset of what exists\nsimpliciter. (Works that defend eternalism include Heller 1990,\nLewis 1986, Mellor 1981 and 1998, Quine 1963, Sider 1997 and 2001,\nSmart 1955, and Williams 1951.) The eternalist maintains that,\nalthough Socrates does not presently exist, he does exist simpliciter\nand so is available to be the constituent of (9), even at times at\nwhich he does not exist. (9) is true, then, because Socrates is in the\ndomain of a past time but not in the domain of the present time. \n\n\nPresentism is the temporal analog of actualism. Presentists maintain\nthat absolutely everything is present; entities, like Socrates, that\ndo not presently exist, simply do not exist. (Works that defend\npresentism include Crisp 2002, 2005, and 2007a/b, Hinchliff 1988 and\n1996, Markosian 2003, Prior 1959, 1962, 1965, 1970, and 1977, and\nZimmerman 1996 and 1998a/b.) Presentists have a hard row to hoe in\naccounting for the apparent truth of (9). In the previous section we\noutlined three actualist accounts of (7) and (8). Each has a temporal\nanalog that can be applied to (9). \n\nFirst, the presentist might appeal to Plantingian individual essences,\nclaiming that (9) is not a singular proposition containing Socrates\nhimself as a constituent, as there is no such entity, but rather a\nproposition with Socrates's individual essence as a constituent. (9)\nis then true because that individual essence was instantiated in the\npast but is no longer instantiated. \n\nSecond, the presentist might claim that Socrates does exist, albeit as\na nonconcrete object, adopting the temporal analog of the view held by\nLinsky and Zalta. Then, although (9) is false, if the predicate\n\u2018x exists\u2019 is regimented as\n\u2203y(y=x), a related proposition concerning Socrates's\nconcreteness is true. Socrates was concrete and now, while he still\nexists, is nonconcrete. (This view carries a commitment to the claim\nthat a concrete object becomes nonconcrete and that a\nnonconcrete object becomes concrete, which is even more\nproblematic than the claim that concreteness is a contingent\nproperty.)\n\nThird, the presentist might follow Adams and distinguish a\nproposition's being true in a time from its being true\nat a time. Consider first a negative existential about a\ncurrently existing object. It is true that George Bush did not exist\nin 1820 because the singular proposition [George Bush exists] is false\nat 1820. The proposition is not true in 1820, because it did not exist\nwhen 1820 was present, as its constituent Bush did not exist\nthen. (9), however, is a negative existential about a past object that\nno longer exists. It is, then, more analogous to (8) from above,\nillustrating the second half of our intuitions that existence is\ncontingent, than to (7). (8) has a quantificational form on its\nsurface, while (9) appears to be singular. This difference makes is\nquestionable whether appeal to the truth in/truth at distinction can\nbe used by the presentist to develop an account of (9)'s truth and\nthus whether there is a viable presentist analog to Adams's actualist\nview. \n\nTo see why, focus on the first conjunct of (9): \u2018Socrates\nexisted\u2019. This appears to have the form\nP\u2203x(s=x), where P is the past-tense\noperator \u2018it was the case that\u2019. But that carries a\ncommitment to the wholly past object Socrates, contrary to\npresentism. The presentist must, then, reinterpret (9) so that it does\nnot involve a proposition singular with respect to Socrates, even one\nembedded in the scope of tense operators. This is problematic, as it\nentails that the sentences \u2018George Bush was sitting\u2019 and\n\u2018Socrates was sitting\u2019 express propositions with radically\ndifferent forms, despite their evident surface grammatical\nsimilarity.\n\nFinally, there is a fourth presentist solution worth discussing, which\nalso has a modal analog not discussed in the previous section. One\nmight insist that, although Socrates does not exist, Socrates is\nnonetheless a constituent of reality, in the range of the most\nunrestricted of quantifiers and available as a constituent of singular\npropositions. This is because there are entities that do not\nexist. This form of Meinongian presentism, according to which\neverything that exists at all presently exists, although\nthere are things that do not presently exist and so do not exist at\nall, has been defended by Mark Hinchliff (Hinchliff 1988; 1996). Many\nfind the distinction between being and existing obscure and the\nMeinongian metaphysics incredible, but the view promises a solution to\nthe problems similar to possibilist and contingent concreteness\nsolutions but with an alternative metaphysics. (For further discussion\nof eternalism and presentism, see the entries spacetime: being and becoming in modern\nphysics and time. For discussion of\nMeinongianism, see existence and nonexistent objects.)\n6.2. Temporal Problems for Singular Propositions: Qualitative Change\n\n\nWe raised two questions concerning (9). We discussed the first in\nsection 6.1 and we now turn to the second. In order to better focus\nattention on the second issues, we switch to an apparent singular\nproposition about a presently existing object, setting aside the\nissues connected with the problems of section 6.1.\n\n (10) Bush is sitting. \n\nBush changes his position, sitting at t and standing at\nt'. Then (10) is true at t and false at\nt'. (Not all would agree that the proposition, as opposed to\ntensed sentence, varies its truth value across time. We discuss this\nbelow.) Suppose that (10) is a singular proposition with Bush as a\nconstituent. What is that constituent like? No answer seems to\nsatisfy. By the law of excluded middle, either it satisfies the\ncondition \u2018x is sitting\u2019 or it doesn't. If it\ndoes, then why is (10) false, as it is at t'; if it doesn't,\nthen it why is (10) true, as it is at t? It also seems\nstrange to think of that (10) itself as changing in its constituents\nacross time, as one and the same proposition is being\nevaluated at the different times.\n\n\nOne's answers to these questions depends on one's views on the nature\nof persistence through time and change. Broadly speaking, there are\ntwo realist views of change: Perdurantism (or four-dimensionalism or\nthe doctrine of temporal parts), which reduces persisting objects to\nmore fundamental, momentary objects, and endurantism (or\nthree-dimensionalism), which takes persisting objects as primitive,\nmaintaining that a persisting object is \u201cwholly present\u201d\nat each time it exists (see Crisp and Smith 2005 for an interesting\nattempt to articulate this notion). Proponents of the perdurantism\ninclude Armstrong 1980, Heller 1990, Jubien 1993, Lewis 1971, \n1976, 1986, and 1988, Quine 1960 and 1963, Robinson 1982, Russell\n1927, Smart 1955 and 1972, Taylor 1955, and Williams 1951, among\nothers. Versions of endurantism are defended in Chisholm 1976,\nForbes 1987, Geach 1966 and 1967, Haslanger 1985, 1989a/b, and 2003,\nHinchliff 1988 and 1996, Johnston 1983 and 1987, Lowe 1987, 1988, and\n1998, Mellor 1981 and 1998, Thomson 1983, van Inwagen 1990 and 2000,\nWiggins 1968, 1980, and 2001, and Zimmerman 1996 and 1998a/b, among\nothers. (There are important differences between the versions of\nendurantism defended in these works, related to whether or not\n\u201ctense is taken seriously\u201d, presentism is accepted or\nrejected, whether or not seemingly monadic properties like\nbeing age 64 are treated as relations between\nindividuals and times, and whether or not the instantiation relation\nbetween individuals and properties is claimed to obtain only relative\nto a time. See the entries identity over\ntime and temporal parts for\nfurther discussion.)\n\n\nPerdurantists maintain that a persisting object is a sum of momentary\ntemporal parts. An object persists through an interval of time by\nhaving numerically distinct temporal parts existing at each moment in\nthat interval. An object undergoes a change in its qualities across\ntime by having numerically distinct temporal parts with contrary\nqualities. A close cousin of perdurantism is the stage view, defended\nin Hawley 2001 and Sider 1996, 1997, 2000, and 2001, according to\nwhich the subject of temporal predication is a momentary temporal\npart. Whereas perdurantists claim that a name like \u2018Bush\u2019\ndesignates a sum of temporal parts, stage theorists maintain that it\ndesignates a momentary object. A past tense predication like\n\u2018x was sitting\u2019 is true of that momentary stage\ns, assuming this a case of the simple past tense, just in\ncase there is an earlier temporal part that bears the counterpart\nrelation to s that satisfies the condition \u2018x\nis sitting\u2019 (and similarly for future tense predications). If\nsingular propositions are the contents of those sentences, then it is\nnatural to claim that different propositions, with different temporal\nparts as constituents, are expressed by utterances of the sentence\n\u2018Bush is sitting\u2019 at different times. There are, then, two\ndistinct propositions corresponding to (10). \n \n (S-101) Bush-at-t is sitting.\n \n\n(S-102) Bush-at-t' is sitting.\n\n\n(S-101) is false simpliciter, being false both at\nt and t', while (S-102) is true\nsimpliciter. In general, then, the constituent of a singular\nproposition is a temporary object.\n\nProponents of perdurantism and the stage view have natural answers to\nour questions about the subject constituent of singular propositions like\n(10). Perdurantists can claim that the subject constituent of (10) is a sum of\ntemporal parts. (10) is true at t because the part of that\nsum that directly exists at t has the property of sitting;\n(10) is false at t' because the part of that sum that\ndirectly exists at t' has the property of not sitting. Stage\ntheorists can claim that there are a host of distinct propositions\ncorresponding to (10), each with a distinct momentary stage as subject\nconstituent in whatever state the object is in at the time of its\nexistence. Momentary objects have their properties absolutely. So,\nBush-at-t is simply sitting, although it will be not\nsitting in virtue of there being a numerically distinct momentary\nobject that is not sitting that is the first's later\ncounterpart. Bush-at-t' is simply not sitting, although it\nwas sitting in virtue of its earlier counterpart's\nproperties.\n\nThese accounts of the constituents of singular propositions concerning\nan object's changing properties presuppose theories of qualitative\nchange incompatible with the intuition that a persisting object\ndirectly bears each of its changing qualities at each time it exists,\nnot inheriting those qualities from the properties of numerically\ndistinct objects. Endurantists take this intuition as a\ncenterpiece. One and the numerically same object, endurantists\nmaintain, exists at different times and directly bearers the qualities\nthe persisting object possesses at any time. The endurantist must,\nthen, develop alternative answers to our questions about (10).\n\n\nOn one version of endurantism, relationalism, seemingly monadic\nproperties like sitting and not sitting are really time indexed\nproperties like sitting-at-t and not sitting-at-t',\nwhich are properties that an object simply has, instantiating them (or\nnot, as the case may be) absolutely. Unlike the original unindexed\nproperties of sitting and not sitting, these two indexed properties\nare not contraries and so there is no problem saying that one and the\nsame object simply has both of them. Like the stage theorist, the\nrelationalist claims that there are in fact a multitude of distinct\npropositions related to (10), like the following.\n \n (R-101) Bush is sitting-at-t.\n \n\n(R-102) Bush is sitting-at-t'.\n\n\n\n(R-101) and (R-102) have absolute truth values,\nthe first being true simpliciter and the second false simpliciter. An\nutterance of the sentence \u2018Bush is sitting\u2019 on t\nexpresses (R-101) while an utterance of that sentence on\nt' expresses the distinct proposition\n(R-102). This much is analogous to the stage\ntheorist's account. But unlike the stage theorist, the relationalist claims\nthat there is a single object that directly bears the properties in\nquestion, the time index qualifying the property and not the subject\nof predication. So, there is a single common subject constituent to\nall of the distinct (R-10) propositions. \n\n\nThe stage theorist and relationalist both reject the claim that a\npersisting object directly bears each of contrary properties it has\nwhen it undergoes a change in qualities, the stage theorist rejecting\nthat the same object directly bears the qualities at the different\ntimes and the relationalist denying that the properties are genuinely\ncontrary. Some claim that rejecting either of the claims is tantamount\nto rejecting the very notion of a thing's changing its qualities\nthrough time. A proponent of the final version of endurantism, a\ndynamic relativist, insists that one and the same object, Bush\nhimself, in the case of (10), directly bears the genuinely contrary\nproperties of sitting and not sitting. The relativist avoids\ncontradiction by claiming that an object doesn't simply have (or lack)\na property simpliciter but has (or lacks) a property relative to a\ntime. Bush has, relative to t, the property of sitting and\nlacks, relative to t', the property of not sitting. A\nproponent of this view rejects the idea that there is a single,\nfundamental, coherent way things are that transcends how things are at\na time. While there are several distinct dynamic accounts worth\ndistinguishing, what unites them all is the idea that, at the most\nfundamental level, a temporally neutral proposition like (10) is true\nat one time and false at another. A proponent of this view should be\nparticularly troubled by our question about the constituent of\n(10). While (10) is true at t and false at t', the\ntime relativization does not affect anything intrinsic to the\nproposition itself; both Bush and the property remain the same when\nthe proposition is evaluated at these different times. But then what\nis the subject constituent of (10) and what is its connection to the\nproperty of sitting?\n\n\nThere are two competing theories to consider. According to the bundle\ntheory, an individual is a bundle of properties. According to the\nsubstance theory, an individual is an entity distinct from its\nproperties in which those properties inhere. \n One attractions of the bundle theory is its promise of explaining\npredication in terms of membership, where the object identified with a\nbundle B of properties instantiates a property\nF just in case F is among\nB. This, however, works against a relativist invoking\nthe bundle theory to answer our second problem. Suppose that the\nsubject constituent of a singular proposition is a bundle of\nproperties. What properties are in the bundle? If the object undergoes\na change, then is (i) exactly one member of the pair of contrary\nproperties among that bundle, (ii) both properties, or is the bundle\n(iii) incomplete, containing neither of the pair? (Recall, the\nrelativist claims that it is the same proposition that is true at one\ntime and false at another and so nothing intrinsic to the proposition\nalters; it must, then, be the same bundle of properties that is the\nobject constituent in both cases.) None of the options seem\nappealing. \n Suppose that, corresponding to (i), the constituent of (10)\nincludes exactly one of the contrary properties of sitting and not\nsitting: say, not sitting. Then it is hard to see how (10) is true, as\nit is at t, given that the object constituent is a bundle of\nproperties including the property of not sitting. Suppose that,\ncorresponding to (ii), both properties are among the bundle. Then it\nis hard to see how Bush exists, given that he is an inconsistent\nbundle of properties. Finally, suppose that, corresponding to (iii),\nthe bundle of properties identified with the object constituent of\n(10) contains neither of its changing contrary properties sitting nor\nnot sitting. Then, given the bundle theorist's offered theory of\npredication, (10) is not true, even at t. \n \n\nConsider now the substance theory. The relativist proponent of the\nsubstance theory might claim that the object constituent of (10) is a\nbare particular, independent of all its properties in which all those\nproperties inhere. (10) can then be said to vary its truth value\nacross time, being true at t and false at t',\nwithout more ado, as the constituent of (10) neither includes nor\nexcludes sitting. (See the entry substance\nfor further discussion.)\n\n\nMany reject the substance theory because they think it entails that\nsomething could exist without any properties whatsoever.  While\nsubstance theorists do claim that the basic bearers of properties are\nindependent of those properties, being the entities in which\nproperties are, in the first instance, instantiated, it does not\nfollow from this that there is something that can exist without any\nproperties at all. To see why, distinguish, first, an object's\ntemporary properties (i.e., the properties it has at some times of its\nexistence and not at others) from its permanent properties. As far as\nthe problem of temporal qualitative variation goes, the constituent of\na singular proposition with o as a constituent need\nnot exclude its permanent properties and so need not be a completely\nbare particular, as the object instantiates those permanent properties\nwhenever it exists.\n\n\nNot all permanent properties are necessary. The property of having\nbeen conceived in Provo is a permanent property of Susan but\ncontingent, as her mother could have been elsewhere when Susan was\nconceived. In response to the modal version of our second problem, a\nsubstance theorist should claim that the constituents of singular\npropositions are independent of their contingent properties but\ninvolve their necessary properties. Where F is a\nnecessary property of o and G a\ncontingent, temporary property of o, the singular\nproposition [o is F] is true at evey\nindex while the proposition [o is G]\nis true at some times and worlds and false at\nothers. o is thus independent of its contingent but\nnot necessary properties. The substance theorist can insist, then that\nthe object constituent of (10) is not a property-less bare particular,\nbut instead an entity clad in its necessary properties.\n\nFinally, many substance theorists, following Aristotle, have found it\nnatural to distinguish necessary from essential properties, claiming\nthat there are some necessary properties that are accidental. For\nexample, everything necessarily has the property of being\nself-identical, but that property is a poor candidate as an essential\nproperty. A thing's essence provides its definition, answering the\nWhat is it? question. Being told that the thing is\nself-identical does not provide much by way of an answer to that\nquestion, as it does not offer grounds for distinguishing the thing in\nquestion from other things. Contrast this with the general essence of\nbeing human. Being told of some particular that it is a human does\nprovide insight into what the thing is. And the property being\nidentical to o is a good candidate for a singular\nessence. While the latter property does not so much ground the\nidentity and diversity of o as simply presuppose it,\nit is a property cognitive grasp of which constitutes an understanding\nof what o is. \n A temporary, contingent singular proposition like (10) is true at\nsome indices and false at others, while a necessary singular\nproposition, like the proposition [Bush is such that 2+2=4], has the\nsame truth value at every index. Essentialist singular propositions,\nlike the proposition [Bush is human], also have the same truth value\nat every index, but, unlike mere necessary propositions, are\nintrinsically true, in the sense that an adequate account of the\nsubject position constituent, and so a full understanding of what that\nentity is involves conceiving of it as having that property, \nprovides one with the grounds to recognize it as true without further\nlogical operation or inference. An individual and its essential\nproperties may still be conceptually distinct entities for the\nsubstance theorist, the substance theorist can still claim that an\nindividual is nonetheless tightly connected to some of its\nproperties. The substance theorist can thus does not need to conceive\nof the object constituents of singular propositions as bare\nparticulars.\n7. Conclusion\nThere are compelling reasons to countenance singular propositions\nas the contents of some sentences of natural language and our\nattitudes. But singular propositions give rise to metaphysical\ndifficulties, as propositions have traditionally been taken to be\nnecessary, permanent existents, but ordinary objects are\nnot. Solutions to these difficulties require stances on general issues\nin the metaphysics of modality and time. In this essay we have\nsurveyed some of the reasons for accepting singular propositions,\nexamined the metaphysical difficulties they create, and distinguished\nseveral strategies for solving those difficulties.",
