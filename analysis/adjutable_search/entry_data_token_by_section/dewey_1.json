    "main_text": "Psychology\n2. Psychology\n\nDewey\u2019s involvement with psychology began early, with the hope\nthat this emerging discipline would provide answers to\nphilosophy\u2019s deepest questions. His early approach was akin to\nHegelian Idealism, though, markedly, it did not incorporate\nHegel\u2019s dialectical logic but instead sought to incorporate new\nmethods in psychology (Alexander forthcoming). He wished to overcome\nlongstanding divisions (between subject and object, matter and spirit,\netc.) and show how human experiences \u2014physical, psychical,\npractical, and imaginative \u2014were all integrated in one, dynamic\nperson (FAE, LW5: 153). Dewey had large ambitions for\npsychology as the new science of self-consciousness, calling\nit the \u201ccompleted method of philosophy\u201d (\u201cPsychology\nas Philosophic Method\u201d, EW1: 157). Although nominally a\ntextbook, Psychology (1887 EW2) was an introduction to\npsychology\u2019s study of the self as ultimate reality.\n\nSoon, Dewey began developing his own psychological theories; extant\naccounts of behavior, he argued, were flawed because they were\npremised upon outdated and false philosophical assumptions. (He\neventually judged that larger questions about the meaning of human\nexistence reached deep into cultural practices and exceeded the\nresources of psychology; such questions required philosophical\ninvestigations of experience in the fields of art, politics, ethics,\nand religion, etc.) Dewey\u2019s psychological work reconstructed the\ncomponents of human conduct (instincts, perceptions, habits, acts,\nemotions, and conscious thought) and these proved integral to later,\nmature statements about experience. They also informed his lifelong\ncontention that mind, contrary to long tradition, is not\nfundamentally subjective and isolated, but social and interactive,\nmade through natural and cultural environments.\n",
