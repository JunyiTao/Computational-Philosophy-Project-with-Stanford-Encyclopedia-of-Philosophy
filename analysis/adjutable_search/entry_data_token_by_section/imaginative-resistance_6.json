    "main_text": "Resistance || The Scope of Resistance\n2.3 The Scope of Resistance\n\nThe proposals put forward by cantians, wontians, and eliminativists\nhave reshaped the scope of imaginative resistance. Its scope has been\nboth narrowed down and expanded in different respects. \n2.3.1 Inclusivity\n\nCantian theories have opened up a theoretical space in which to\nquestion the assumed asymmetry between the imaginability of morally\nand nonmorally deviant content. Given that\ndependence/supervenience/virtue relations also hold between different\nkinds of higher-level and lower-level properties or facts other than\nmoral kinds, violations of these relations can trigger resistance as\nwell. Therefore, our list of resistance-triggering claims should be\nmore inclusive and include not only counter-evaluative claims but also\ncounter-descriptive claims (inclusivity thesis). Kendall Walton (1994)\nclaims that other kinds of normative deviances such as aesthetic\ndeviance can also trigger resistance. Imagine that a comedian in a\nstory tells a dumb knock knock joke (e.g., \u201cKnock, knock\u201d.\n\u201cWho\u2019s there?\u201d \u201cCow says\u201d. \u201cCow\nsays who?\u201d \u201cNo, a cow says mooooo!\u201d) No matter how\nmuch effort the author thereafter expends, we would not be persuaded\nof its hilarity. \n\nYablo (2002) argues that imaginative resistance arises due to deviant\nuse of response-dependent descriptive concepts, such as shape. We\nmight thereby experience resistance when we are asked to imagine the\nbeauty and elegance of a monster truck competition or that the\nfive-fingered maple leaf that Sally is holding is oval. Weatherson\n(2004) goes even further to claim that, alongside deviant attribution\nof thick moral concepts and deviant evaluative sentences, other\ntriggers of imaginative resistance include sentences expressing\ndeviant epistemic evaluations, attributions of mental states,\nattributions of mental or linguistic content, deviant use of some\nshape predicates, some deviant ontological claims, and deviant claims\nabout constitution. For instance, according to Weatherson, we cannot\nimagine, in an alternative Quixote story of his own concoction, that\nQuixote\u2019s favorite item of furniture is a television which is\nfor all intents and purposes indistinguishable from a common knife.\nWhat counts as a television is tied to certain functional roles and\nthese roles are missing in the story. (See Barnes & Black 2016 and\nKim, Kneer, & Stuart 2019 for empirical studies that examine\nwhether the type of the deviant claim\u2014its being\ncounter-evaluative or counter-descriptive\u2014makes a difference in\nresistance reactions. On the basis of their studies, Black and Barnes\ncome to the conclusion that the type of the claim makes vast\nindividual differences between resistance reactions, while Kim et al.\nconclude that \u201cimaginative resistance depends on the weirdness\nof content, not whether the claim is evaluative or descriptive\u201d\n(2019: 160).)\n\nAnna Mahtani (2012) questions whether it is the case that imaginative\nresistance only arises in situations that involve conflict between\nsome fictional proposition and what we believe to be the case.\nJustifications of female infanticide, slavery, or genocide\nnon-controversially are in conflict with our moral norms. Mahtani\nargues against the notion that conflict is a necessary element of\nimaginative resistance by claiming that there are cases which (i)\ngenerate imaginative resistance and (ii) are not properly\ncharacterizable as involving a conflict between an utterance in the\nfiction and the reader\u2019s beliefs. She gives the example of a\nstory involving a character named Lucy who performs a morally\nambiguous action (2012: 419). Mahtani claims that the author\u2019s\npronouncement of the rightness of this morally ambiguous action will\nbe met with resistance, even though the author\u2019s claim does not\ndirectly conflict with our beliefs regarding Lucy\u2019s action. \n2.3.2 Genre\n\nOne of the main contributions of eliminativist accounts to discussions\nregarding the scope of imaginative resistance comes from their\ninsistence on the importance of context. When this insight is combined\nwith Gendler\u2019s (2000) emphasis on the importance of the realist\ngenre, the result has been a proliferation of accounts defending the\nrelevance of genre in determining the quantitative differences between\npeople\u2019s resistance reactions (Weinberg 2008, Nanay 2010, Liao\net al. 2014, Liao 2016). The main idea is that our reactions to the\nsame moral deviation, let\u2019s say female infanticide, can differ\ndepending on the genre of the work in which they occur. One might take\nplace in the context of an Aztec or a Greek myth, or science-fiction,\nand the other might take place in the context of a realist fiction.\nLiao et al. (2014) conducted two empirical studies to put this idea to\nthe test and demonstrate that genre is salient in explaining\nresistance reactions and variations. On the basis of their Study 1,\nthey concluded that lack of genre competence strongly correlates with\ncomparative difficulties in imagining a morally deviant proposition\nand accepting it as true. On the basis of their Study 2, they\nconcluded that genre manipulation can lead to variation in the\nresistance reactions triggered by the same proposition. (See Phelan\n2017 in\n Other Internet Resources\n for a replication of the studies; see Black et al. 2018 for a study\nthat examines the salience of genre familiarity to resistance\nreactions.) \n\nIn his 2016 article, Liao expands on the results of this previous\ncollaborative research and paper. He claims that the empirical studies\nshow that genre conventions limit the types of propositions that can\nappear within the context of a work, so the fictionality puzzle arises\ndue to genre convention-discordant propositions (2016; 474). He adds\nthat each genre convention is associated with different expectations\nas to what kind of propositions can appear within this genre (2016:\n471). Therefore, the imaginability puzzle arises because we find it\ncomparatively difficult to imagine genre expectation-discordant\npropositions. For instance, in a realistic fiction, we expect all the\npropositions to be in compliance with our real-world moral norms. This\nexpectation does not apply if the work is an Aztec myth or a Greek\ntragedy.\n2.3.3 Bias\n\nAnother ripple effect of eliminativists\u2019 theories, particularly\nTodd\u2019s theory, has been the focus on the importance of the\nimaginer\u2019s own context for generating variations in imaginative\nresistance reactions. Adriana Clavel-Vazquez (2018) discusses a\nspecial kind of imaginative resistance case which makes it clear that\nit is not only the context of the fictional work (its genre) that has\neffects on our engagement but also our own context as well. The case\nshe discusses involves rough heroines. \n\nRough heroes are deeply morally flawed protagonists that demand\nappreciators\u2019 allegiance. We owe the term \u201crough\nheroes\u201d to David Hume (1757 [1875: 322]); however it is Anne\nEaton who gives us the list of conditions for being a rough hero\n(2012: 281\u2013292). Clavel-Vazquez improves on Eaton\u2019s list\n(2018: 203): \n\nhis moral flaws are grievous, \nhis flaws are an integral part of his personality,\nthe rough hero intentionally engages in immoral actions and his\nremorse is not a central part of the narrative,\nthe audience is not prescribed to forgive him or dismiss his\nactions as the result of misfortune, weakness, or ignorance,\nhis vices are not outweighed by other morally relevant features.\n\n\n\nSome examples given of rough heroes are Breaking Bad\u2019s\nWalter White and Hannibal Lecter in Silence of the Lambs. The\ninteresting aspect of rough heroes is that even though they have all\nthese negative characteristics, we still end up aligning ourselves\nwith them due to pro-attitudes prescribed by the narrative despite the\ninitial resistance we feel. Indeed, the created tension is necessary\nfor proper appreciation: the tension between condemning the hero due\nto his moral flaws and developing pro-attitudes towards the hero due\nto narrative encouragement eventually leads to overcoming our initial\nresistance to the hero and to aligning ourselves with him. Eaton\nconsiders this created tension and the subsequent overcoming of the\ntension to be the narrative\u2019s artistic achievement (2012: 285).\n\n\nClavel-Vazquez argues that there exists an asymmetry between rough\nheroes and rough heroines (she calls this the \u201caffective\npuzzle\u201d). In the case of the rough heroines, it is less likely\nfor us to overcome our resistance. Indeed, the almost nonexistence of\nrough heroines, she claims, attests to that fact. The narrative does\nnot seem to have equal success when it comes to rough heroines, and\nthis might be the narrative\u2019s fault. We have various examples of\nalmost-workable rough heroines, such as Amy Dunne in Gone\nGirl, Claire Underwood in House of Cards, and so on. But\nwe are either not able to feel allegiance with them, or they are not\nas ethically transgressive as their male counterparts. (One exception\nseems to be Villanelle in Killing Eve so far.) Clavel-Vazquez\nargues that we resist aligning ourselves with rough heroines because\nin being morally transgressive they break with gender norms and\nexpectations. Our sexist biases affect our resistance reactions.\nAccording to her, this means that when we examine the cause of\nimaginative resistance, we need to keep in mind our own interpretative\nhorizons, which are shaped by our sociocultural context. \n\nThe existence of variation in imaginative resistance reactions led the\neliminativists to conclude that imaginative resistance is not a\ngenuine phenomenon. Starting with a second wave of research on\nimaginative resistance (around 2010), variation is taken to be\nsomething that can be accounted for (see Gendler and Liao 2016 for the\nfirst and second wave distinction). According to some, it should be\naccounted for by an all-encompassing theory (e.g., Peterson 2019), and\naccording to others it should be addressed by adopting explanatory\npluralism (e.g., Liao et al. 2014). This variation-sensitivity has\nsince been one of the general themes in imaginative resistance\nresearch and one of the influences responsible for the proliferation\nof empirical research in the field. (See Black and Barnes 2017 for a\npsychological study that aims to show that there are different\ninfluences on our resistance reactions, such as disgust\nsensitivity.)\n3. Imagination\n\nThe use of the word \u201cimaginative\u201d in \u201cimaginative\nresistance\u201d has been criticized for disregarding the fact that\nnot all resistance reactions are related to the imagination and it has\nbeen suggested that perhaps imagination might have nothing to do with\nthe resistance reactions. One of the debates on imaginative resistance\nhas dealt with whether imaginative resistance cases put constraints on\nour cognitive imagination (belief-like imagining) or conative\nimagination (desire-like imagining), or fail to put any constraints on\nthe imagination at all (see sections 2.1 and 2.2 of the entry on\n imagination\n for explanations of the relation between imagination and belief, on\nthe one hand, and the relation between imagination and desire, on the\nother). It is possible to regroup some of the theories of imaginative\nresistance that have been covered in\n Section 2,\n alongside other theories, with respect to this debate. \n\nMiyazono and Liao (2016) take on this task and provide a detailed\ntaxonomy of the positions in the imaginative resistance literature\nwith respect to what psychological components of the human mind they\ntake to be necessary for explaining imaginative resistance. The\ntheories can be divided into three main groups: cognitive imagination\ntheories, conative imagination theories, and no-imagination\ntheories.\n3.1 Imagination Theories\n\nAccording to cognitive imagination theories, imaginative resistance\nreactions reflect either our inability or unwillingness to take on\nbelief-like imaginings. We might not be able to take on the imaginings\nbecause cognitive imaginings are processed by the same system that is\nin charge of processing similar beliefs (see Nichols 2004, 2006a;\nWeinberg & Meskin 2006). Or we might not be able to cognitively\nimagine higher-level claims in the absence of support from lower-level\nfacts because such belief-like imaginings are possible only when they\nreceive adequate lower-level support as ordinary beliefs do (see\nWalton 1994, 2006; Weatherson 2004; Stear 2015). Or we might be unable\nor unwilling to take on the belief-like imaginings because we do not\nwant to export them or believe them given a conflicting belief we hold\nor our lack of trust for the narrator (Gendler 2000, 2006; Matravers\n2003; Stock 2017). \n\nAccording to conative imagination theories, we cannot desire-like or\nvalue-like imagine what we are asked to because we lack the necessary\ndesire or second-order desire to do so (see Currie 2002 and Stokes\n2006). \n3.2 No-Imagination Theories\n\nNo-imagination theories appeal neither to cognitive imagination nor to\nconative imagination in their explanations of the mechanism(s)\ninvolved in the resistance reactions. \n\nGendler (2008a, 2008b) claims that alief, which she proposes as an\ninnate propensity to automatically respond to a real or apparent\nstimulus, is what is responsible for resistance reactions, not\nimagination (for more on alief, see section 3.3 of the entry on\n imagination).\n Alief is more primitive and fundamental than cognitive or conative\nimagination. It is responsible for generating a resistance response to\nprompted imaginings due to the perceived (perhaps unconsciously\nperceived or registered) possibility of contagion. \n\nAnother explanation of imaginative resistance that locates the source\nof resistance reactions somewhere other than the imagination puts\nemotions center stage. Ronald de Sousa (2010) claims that what is\ngoing on in resistance cases is not that we are unable to make sense\nof the content of the imagined situation but that we fail to\nexperience certain emotional responses or fail to respond altogether\nto certain imagined prospects. For instance, Giselda\nengenders moral repulsion on the side of the imaginer while\nprescribing that they feel moral allegiance or approval. The\nknock-knock joke, on the other hand, fails to engender amusement while\nthe author insists that we find it hilarious.\n4. Conclusion\n\nAs we have seen, in \u201cthe puzzle of imaginative resistance\u201d\nso far only the word \u201cof\u201d has been uncontentious. However,\nthis should not be taken as a sign of impasse. Instead of engendering\nconfusion and disorientation, the liveliness of the debate points to\nthe richness of the topic and openings for new fronts in imaginative\nresistance research. This area of inquiry is still in its early stages\nand further research is needed on all of the topics discussed above.\nSome of most pressing research questions include: Are there\nungrounded/unjustified imaginative resistance reactions? How can one\novercome ungrounded/unjustified imaginative resistance reactions? How\ncan we revise the extant theories to account for variation in\nresistance reactions and diversity of resistance-triggering claims?\nThere is much more we can gather from further empirical research on\nthe topic, and there is plenty of opportunity for further research on\nthe broader implications imaginative resistance has for fields such as\nmoral psychology, aesthetic psychology, cognitive architecture,\nsemantics and pragmatics of evaluative terms, modal epistemology, and\nso on (building on the work of scholars such as Levy 2005, Driver\n2008, Levin 2012).",
