    "main_text": "Examples and Non-Examples || Dewey\u2019s Other Examples\n2.2 Dewey\u2019s Other Examples\n\nDewey (1910, 1933) sprinkles his book with other examples of critical\nthinking. We will refer to the following.\n\nWeather: A man on a walk notices that it has suddenly become\ncool, thinks that it is probably going to rain, looks up and sees a\ndark cloud obscuring the sun, and quickens his steps (1910:\n6\u201310; 1933: 9\u201313).\n\nDisorder: A man finds his rooms on his return to them in\ndisorder with his belongings thrown about, thinks at first of burglary\nas an explanation, then thinks of mischievous children as being an\nalternative explanation, then looks to see whether valuables are\nmissing, and discovers that they are (1910: 82\u201383; 1933:\n166\u2013168).\n\nTyphoid: A physician diagnosing a patient whose conspicuous\nsymptoms suggest typhoid avoids drawing a conclusion until more data\nare gathered by questioning the patient and by making tests (1910:\n85\u201386; 1933: 170).\n\nBlur: A moving blur catches our eye in the distance, we ask\nourselves whether it is a cloud of whirling dust or a tree moving its\nbranches or a man signaling to us, we think of other traits that\nshould be found on each of those possibilities, and we look and see if\nthose traits are found (1910: 102, 108; 1933: 121, 133).\n\nSuction pump: In thinking about the suction pump, the\nscientist first notes that it will draw water only to a maximum height\nof 33 feet at sea level and to a lesser maximum height at higher\nelevations, selects for attention the differing atmospheric pressure\nat these elevations, sets up experiments in which the air is removed\nfrom a vessel containing water (when suction no longer works) and in\nwhich the weight of air at various levels is calculated, compares the\nresults of reasoning about the height to which a given weight of air\nwill allow a suction pump to raise water with the observed maximum\nheight at different elevations, and finally assimilates the suction\npump to such apparently different phenomena as the siphon and the\nrising of a balloon (1910: 150\u2013153; 1933: 195\u2013198).\n",
