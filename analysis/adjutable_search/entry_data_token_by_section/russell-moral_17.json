The idea that there are objective moral facts breeds intolerance\nand fanaticism. Accordingly, the rejection of this idea \u201cwould\ntend to render people more truly social\u201d, specifically, more\ntolerant. \u201cMoral warfare would continue\u201d, he writes,\n\u201cbut not with poisoned arrows.\u201d Russell came to agree,\nespecially after the outbreak of World War I.\n\n\nMy H[erbert] S[pencer] lecture was partly inspired by disgust at the\nuniversal outburst of righteousness in all nations since the war\nbegan. It seems the essence of virtue is persecution, and it has given\nme a disgust of all ethical notions, which evidently are chiefly\nuseful as an excuse for murder. (Letter to Samuel Alexander, 5/2/1915,\nRoE: 107/Papers 8: 56)\n\n\nThere is something rather paradoxical about this, since Russell was\nfirmly convinced of the rightness of his own anti-War activities:\n\u201cWhen the War came, I felt as if I heard the voice of God. I\nknew it was my business to protest, however futile protest might\nbe\u201d (Autobiography II: 18). If there are no objective\nmoral properties, there is no such thing as moral knowledge, which\nmeans that Russell cannot have literally known that he ought\nto protest. At best he could have known that he ought to protest\ngiven his values. But though he sometimes seems to talk as if\nit is objectively wrong to believe in objective values, Russell\u2019s\nposition is (or can be made to be) coherent. It might just be a fact\nthat moral realists tend to be more intolerant and cruel than moral\nrelativists and anti-realists. Hence those who dislike intolerance and\ncruelty have a reason for running down objectivity. As Russell himself\nput it,\n\n\nfor my part, I should wish to see in the world less cruelty,\npersecution, punishment, and moral reprobation than exists at present;\nto this end, I believe that a recognition of the subjectivity of\nethics might conduce. (RoE: 117/Papers 13: 326)\n\n\nThe word \u201crecognition\u201d suggests that the\n\u201csubjectivity of ethics\u201d is true, and thus that there is\nno such thing as a non-natural property of goodness. But setting the\nsuccess-word to one side, it might be the case that we would\nbe better off believing in the subjectivity of ethics since believing\nin objective values leads to persecution, punishment, cruelty and\nmoral reprobation. It might pay in terms of peace, love and\nunderstanding if people came to believe Russell\u2019s brand of emotivism.\nBut the fact that a belief pays, in some sense, does not make\nit true, as Russell himself was at pains to point out (see\nPhilosophical Essays, chs. iv & v). So even if we\nwould be better off believing that there were no objective\nvalues (a thesis Russell later came to doubt), this does not prove\nthat there are no such things.\n",
