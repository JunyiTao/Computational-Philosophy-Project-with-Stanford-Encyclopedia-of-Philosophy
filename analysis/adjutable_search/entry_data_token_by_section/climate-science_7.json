    "main_text": "Climate Modeling || Types of Climate Model\n4.1 Types of Climate Model\n\nClimate scientists often speak of a \u201chierarchy\u201d or\n\u201cspectrum\u201d of climate models, ranging from simple to\ncomplex. The complexity of climate models increases with: the number\nof spatial dimensions represented; the resolution at which those\ndimensions are represented; the range of climate system components and\nprocesses \u201cincluded\u201d in the model; and the extent to which\nthose processes are given realistic rather than simplified\nrepresentations. As a consequence, more complex models tend to be more\ncomputationally demanding as well. The discussion below introduces a\nfew types of model, illustrating different levels of complexity (for\nother types see, e.g., Stocker 2011; McGuffie & Henderson-Sellars\n2014). The types discussed here are physics-based, in the sense that\nthey are grounded to a significant extent in physical theory.\nData-driven or \u201cempirical\u201d climate models also have been\ndeveloped for some purposes but are less common and will be mentioned\nonly in passing.\n\nAmong the simplest climate models are energy balance models\n(EBMs), designed to represent earth\u2019s surface energy budget in a\nhighly aggregate way (McGuffie & Henderson-Sellars 2014: Ch.3).\nThese models, which often have surface temperature as their sole\ndependent variable, are constructed using both physical theory (e.g.,\nthe Stefan-Boltzmann equation) and empirical parameters (e.g.,\nrepresenting the albedo of the earth and the emissivity of the\natmosphere). Zero-dimensional EBMs represent the entire climate system\nas a single point. They can be used to calculate by hand an estimate\nof the globally-averaged surface temperature when the system is in\nradiative equilibrium. One-dimensional (1-D) and two-dimensional (2-D)\nEBMs take a similar energy-budget approach but represent average\ntemperature at different latitudes and/or longitudes and account in a\nrough way for the transport of heat between them (see Sellers 1969 for\nan early example). The equations of 1-D and 2-D EBMs are usually\nsolved with the help of digital\n computers.[1]\n\nEarth system models of intermediate complexity (EMICs) come\nin a range of forms but tend to be both comprehensive and highly\nidealized (Claussen et al. 2002). An EMIC might incorporate not only representations of the atmosphere, ocean, land surface and sea ice, but also representations\nof some biospheric processes, ice sheets and ocean sediment\nprocesses. These representations, however, are often relatively simple or coarse. The atmosphere component of an EMIC, for\ninstance, might be a two-dimensional enhanced version of an EBM known\nas an energy moisture balance model. The ocean might be simulated\nexplicitly in three dimensions using fluid dynamical equations, but\nwith low spatiotemporal resolution. (See Flato et al. 2013: Table 9.2\nand 9.A.2 for examples and further details.) The relative simplicity\nand coarseness of EMICs makes them computationally efficient, however, which in\nturn makes it possible to use them to simulate the climate system on\nmillennial time scales.\n\nAt the complex end of the spectrum, coupled ocean-atmosphere\ngeneral circulation models (GCMs) simulate atmospheric and\noceanic motions in three spatial dimensions, often at as high a\nresolution as available supercomputing power allows. They also\nincorporate representations of the land surface and sea ice, and they\nattempt to account for important interactions among all of these\ncomponents. GCMs evolved from atmosphere-only general circulation\nmodels, which in turn were inspired by early weather forecasting\nmodels (Edwards 2000; Weart 2010). The latest generation of climate\nmodels, earth system models (ESMs), extend GCMs by\nincorporating additional model components related to atmospheric\nchemistry, aerosols and/or ocean biogeochemistry (Flato et al. 2013:\n747). In both GCMs and ESMs, numerical methods are used to estimate\nsolutions to discretized versions of fluid dynamical equations at a\nset of points on a three-dimensional\n grid.[2]\n With increased computing power in recent decades, the horizontal\nspacing of these grid points for the atmosphere has reduced from\nseveral hundred kilometres to ~100 km, and the number of vertical\nlayers has increased from ~10 to ~50, with a time step of 10\u201330\nminutes (McGuffie & Henderson-Sellers 2014: 282). Despite this\nincreased resolution, many important processes\u2014including the\nformation of clouds and precipitation, the transfer of radiation, and\nchemical reactions\u2014still occur at sub-grid scales; accounting\nfor the effects of these processes is a major challenge, as discussed\nin the next section.\n\nAnother important type of climate model is the regional climate\nmodel (RCM). Like GCMs and ESMs, RCMs are designed to be\ncomprehensive and to incorporate realistic, theory-based\nrepresentations of climate system processes. Unlike GCMs and ESMs,\nhowever, RCMs represent only a portion of the globe (e.g., a continent\nor country), which allows them to have a higher spatiotemporal\nresolution without exceeding available computing power. With this\nhigher resolution, RCMs can explicitly simulate smaller-scale\nprocesses, and they also have the potential to reveal spatial\nvariations in conditions\u2014due to complex topography, for\ninstance\u2014that cannot be resolved by GCMs/ESMs. These features\nmake RCMs an attractive tool for studies of regional climate change\n(e.g., Mearns et al. 2013). A challenge, however, is specifying\nconditions at the horizontal boundaries of the modelled region in a\nphysically-consistent way; in practice, these boundary conditions\noften are informed by results from GCM/ESM simulations.\n",
