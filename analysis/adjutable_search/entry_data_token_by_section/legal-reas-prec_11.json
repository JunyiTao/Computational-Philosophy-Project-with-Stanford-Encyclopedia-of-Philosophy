    "main_text": "Analogy || Principles\n4.1 Principles\n\n\nAn influential view on analogy regards it as grounded in the\nprinciples that underlie existing cases (e.g. MacCormick\n1978, 152\u201394; Eisenberg 1988, 83\u201396; Sunstein 1993). A\nbody of cases can be examined to determine which principle (or set of\ncoherent principles) explains and justifies those decisions, in a\nprocess akin to reflective equilibrium. The process is only akin to\nreflective equilibrium because the individual cases (the equivalent of\nthe specific judgements about particular situations) are either immune\nfrom revision, or are highly resistant to revision.\n So the principles must map the decided cases precisely, or must\ndepart from only a small proportion of them. If the principle(s)\nidentified in this process apply to the instant case, then that\nprovides a good reason in favour of the result supported by the\nprinciple.\n\n\nA number of criticisms question whether this account captures what is\nnormally going on in analogical reasoning. One criticism focuses on\nthe fact that the principle must track the existing cases and try to\nmake the best of them. Unless the decisions are all correct on the\nmerits, any principle based on them must itself be flawed: for if it\nwere morally correct it would not support the mistaken decisions. The\nquestion this raises is whether it can be justifiable to use such a\nprinciple to decide a novel case, rather than decide the case on its\nown merits. Can there be \u2018principles\u2019 of this kind, which\nare neither conventional parts of a practice nor morally correct?\n(see further Alexander 1996b, 1998, Alexander and Kress 1995, 1997) A\nmore common view, however, is that a principle that makes best sense\nof a series of cases or aspects of legal doctrine can have some\njustificatory force even though the cases or doctrines are morally\nimperfect. In the case of tort liability, for example, the cases might\nbe best explained by the principle that liability will only arise\nwhere the defendant's conduct has been unreasonable, i.e., that\nboth harm to the plaintiff and unreasonable conduct is necessary for\nliability. This principle may be morally mistaken, i.e., there may be\nsituations where even reasonable conduct should result in legal\nliability. Nevertheless the principle may still be regarded as having\nsome justificatory force in the context of that legal system. A judge\nmight think that the correct moral principle is that other things\nbeing equal there should be no liability without unreasonable\nconduct. But although the law is imperfect in this way, the legal\nprinciple still has some force because it is a near enough neighbour\nto the correct principle and it explains the existing\n cases.[19]\n\n\nA separate line of criticism centres on the fact that courts do not\noften articulate their use of analogies in terms of some\n\u2018principle\u2019 inherent in an earlier case. Where principles\nare used as arguments for a result, earlier cases tend to be cited as\nillustrations of the application of the principle, rather than as\nanalogies to the facts of the case at hand. If another case\nis cited as providing an analogy, the emphasis will be on how\n\u2018close\u2019 the analogy is, i.e., on how specific the common\ncharacterisation of the facts of the two cases is, and how that\ncharacterisation relates to the rationale for the earlier\ndecision. The more specific an analogy, the stronger; the more\nabstract the characterisation, the weaker the argument as an\nanalogy. The reason for this is that the more specific the analogy,\nthe less room there is for distinguishing the two cases, whereas the\nmore abstract the analogy the more grounds on which the two cases may\nbe regarded as significantly different. So if it is lawful to consent\nto tatooing, it is also lawful to consent to a decorative branding,\nwhich is closely\n analogous.[20] \n On the other hand, the analogy of boxing to sadomasochistic\nactivities is more remote, although both involve the intentional\ninfliction of a certain level of\n harm.[21]\n\n\nThis last point relates to the fact that cases are rarely justified\nsolely on the basis of principles: instead there are a range of\nconsiderations which are applicable and justify the result. A\nprinciple may apply with equal force to two cases with very different\nfacts, but those differences may make the cases not very\nanalogous. What this suggests is that while principles do provide\narguments for reaching a certain result, they do not explain the\nnature of analogical reasoning.\n",
