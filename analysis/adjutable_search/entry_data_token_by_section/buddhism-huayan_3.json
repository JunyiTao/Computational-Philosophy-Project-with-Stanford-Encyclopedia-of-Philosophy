    "main_text": "Dushun (557\u2013640)\n2. Dushun (557\u2013640)\n\nDushun holds the posthumous honor of being known as the first\npatriarch of the Huayan School. He was active as a monk during the Sui\n(581\u2013618) and early Tang (618\u2013907) dynasties. We know very little\nabout his life. He had no sectarian affiliation, and he seems to have\nbeen relatively unconcerned with scholarly controversies. We know that\nhe was keenly interested in the Avatamsaka Sutra, and that he\nwas renowned as a meditation master. For a time, he served as leader\nof the Zhixiang Temple on Zhongnan Mountain, which was a center for\nstudying the Avatamsaka Sutra. His main interest seems to\nhave been ministering to rural laity for the sake of making Buddhist\npractice relevant to their lives\u2014by hosting common meals,\ndistributing food to the poor, chanting scriptural passages, and\noffering edifying homilies. \n\nDushun authored only a handful of texts. Chief among these is\nDiscernments of the Dharmadhatu of Avatamsaka (Ch. Huayan\nfajie guanmen, trans. Gimello 1976b, 457\u2013510). This no longer\nexists as an independent text. But it is interspersed within several\ncommentaries, most notably those by Chengguan (T45.1883; trans. Cleary\n1993, 71\u2013124) and Zongmi (T45.1884, trans. King 1976). The text itself\nis quite unusual. It is not a commentary on the Avatamsaka\nSutra. Nor does it offer exegesis of the Avatamsaka\nSutra. There are no paraphrases, no explanations of passages, no\ndefinitions or technical terminology. Instead, the text distils the\ncentral insights available through studying the Avatamsaka\nSutra. Its apparent goal is making the Avatamsaka Sutra\nrelevant to meditative practice and accessible to the laity. \n\nDiscernments of the Dharmadhatu divides into three sections,\neach of which corresponds to a \u201cdiscernment\u201d or meditation\non the content of the Avatamsaka Sutra. The first discernment\nreviews the equivalence between form (Skt. rupa) and\nemptiness. This is a well-known equivalence from the Heart\nSutra and other literature from the Indian Mahayana tradition.\nNothing in this discernment should be unfamiliar to students of the\nhistory of Indian Buddhism. The second discernment, by contrast,\ncontains two innovations that are critical for understanding the\nChinese appropriation of Buddhism\u2014and thereby renders the text\nespecially significant from a philosophical perspective. \n\nThe first innovation is Dushun\u2019s decision to use the Chinese\nterm li (principle/pattern) to characterize the nature of\nultimate reality. Indian Mahayana typically characterizes the nature\nof ultimate reality as emptiness (Skt. sunyata) or suchness\n(Skt. tathata). Both of these terms connote something that\ndefies conceptualization. Dushun imbues li with an\nepistemological connotation: li is that which is present to\nthose who achieve nirvana. Nirvanic experience, as\nDushun understands it, reveals neither emptiness nor an\nundifferentiated manifold but, instead, boundless and ceaseless\nactivity that has a patterned coherence to it (see Jiang 2001,\n466\u2013467; for a contrary interpretation, see Gimello 1976a, 125). \n\nBy discussing li\u2014the boundless and ceaseless activity\npresent during nirvanic experience\u2014rather than\nemptiness, Dushun forestalls any conflation between li and\ntotal voidness. Whatever else it might be, li is far\nfrom nothing at all. By discussing li rather than\ntathata, Dushun affords the possibility of saying something\nabout ultimate reality. Conceptualizing nirvanic experience\nas encountering suchness presents those experiences as something other\nthan \u201csuch,\u201d but conceptualizing nirvanic\nexperience as encountering li does not present activity as\nsomething other than activity. Dushun\u2019s first innovation thereby\nopens the way to developing a metaphysical theory (conceptualization)\nabout reality as encountered during nirvanic experience. \n\nThe second innovation in Discernments of the Dharmadhatu is\nDushun\u2019s decision to use the Chinese term shi\n(thing/events/phenomena) to refer to the myriad things that appear in\nour experiences of reality. Indian Mahayana prefers to oppose\nemptiness to form, where form stands in as one of the myriad\ndharmas that constitute reality. Strictly speaking, then, the\nequivalence \u201cemptiness is form, form is emptiness\u201d is a\nclaim only about the relation between the dharmas\nand the notion of emptiness: it is the claim that all dharmas\nare empty. This equivalence says nothing about whether composite\nrealities\u2014such as persons and chariots\u2014are empty. \n\nThe distinction between dharmas and composite realities makes\nsense in the Abhidharma tradition: dharmas are real,\ncomposites are empty. But all Mahayana traditions claim that\ndharmas are empty as well. So Dushun\u2019s second\ninnovation makes Mahayana metaphysics more efficient: absent a reason\nto distinguish dharmas from the constituents built therefrom,\neverything is on an ontological par, dharma and\nnon-dharma alike. \n\nDushun titles the second discernment the \u201cmutual non-obstruction\nbetween li and shi.\u201d He divides the\ndiscernment into ten themes, which naturally group into five pairs:\n\n\n1/2 Li and shi pervade each other. \n3/4 Li and shi make each other manifest. \n5/6 Li and shi hide each other. \n7/8 Li and shi are identical with each other.\n\n9/10 Li and shi are distinct from each other.\n\n\n\nThese five mutual relationships specify the meaning of \u201cmutual\nnon-obstruction.\u201d Since the first is fundamental to the\nremaining four, we focus on understanding the \u201cpervasion\u201d\nrelation between li and shi. \n\nThe mutual pervasion of li and shi presents itself\nas paradoxical. Li is boundless and ceaseless. Shi\nare limited and impermanent. Pervade means \u201cto spread through\nand be totally in every part of.\u201d The paradox is that it is not\nat all clear how the limited and the unlimited can pervade each other.\nWould not the boundless become bounded by virtue of being\ncontained within something limited? Would not the limited, by virtue\nof being limited, need to become unlimited in order to spread\nthrough every part of the boundless? The first pairing in\nDushun\u2019s second discernment seems to violate two quite plausible\nconstraints, namely: nothing limited contains anything boundless; and\nnothing limited appears throughout anything boundless. \n\nDushun admits that his claim of mutual pervasion \u201ctranscends\nconventional sensibilities.\u201d However, he offers a metaphor for\nclarification, comparing li to water and shi to\nwaves. This metaphor, originating with the Lankavatara Sutra,\nposits that each wave contains the entire ocean, and that each wave\nappears in every part of the ocean. These posits are not entirely\nimplausible. Individual waves extend across the entire ocean, insofar\nas waves lack natural borders for extension; and waves extend beneath\nthe surface of ocean waters, insofar as waves also lack natural\nborders for thickness. But, regardless of plausibility, the metaphor\nsuggests that the mutual pervasion of li and shi\namounts to the claim that none of the myriad things has natural\nborders even though they appear to have them (by virtue of presenting\nto us as discrete individuals that are separate from and independent\nof each other). \n\nThe third discernment in Discernment of the Dharmadhatu is\n\u201ctotal pervasion and accommodation.\u201d This discernment\nconcerns the nature of and relations among individual shi.\nDushun observes that each shi is nothing other than\nli and yet, in its individuality, distinct from li;\nthat each shi includes, and is included within, all other\nshi; that this mutual inclusivity makes each shi\nsomehow omnipresent, albeit in ways that preserve differences among\nshi; that each shi contains, and is contained by,\nall other shi; that this mutual containment, while preserving\ndifferences among shi, is fractal, such that even the\nsmallest mote of dust contains the entirety of everything else, which\nin turn contains the same mote of dust containing everything else, on\nand on ad infinitum; and that mutual inclusion and\ncontainment is simultaneous and, somehow, a matter of perspective.\nThese claims are, somehow, consequences of the mutual pervasion of\nli and shi. It remains for subsequent contributors\nto the Huayan School to explain and elaborate upon Dushun\u2019s\nfinal discernment. \n",
