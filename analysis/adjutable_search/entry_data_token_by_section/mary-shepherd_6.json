    "main_text": "Knowledge of the existence of an external world || The phenomena of dreams and only possible basis of skepticism\n3.3 The phenomena of dreams and only possible basis of skepticism\n\nThe phenomena of dreams are thought to pose an objection to belief in\nthe existence of the external world because we may credit the illusory\nimages with continued, external, independent existence. This is reason\nto doubt the existence of all perceptual objects unless we have better\nevidence for their reality than we have for that of the seeming\nobjects of dreams. Shepherd dispatches the objection. She grants that\nsensations that occur in dreams are like those that occur in waking\nexperience although she denies that dreams can cause the same\nsensations in the same order as those caused by objects existing in\nnature (EPEU [2020: 99\u2013100]). She argues that when dreaming, a\nperson\u2019s ability to collect a large number of sensations is\nlimited. When awake, we can move our eyes and limbs and find the\nsupposed object does not fulfill its definition (e.g. EPEU [2020:\n29\u201333]). She allows that assuming we are awake, it is difficult\nto know whether an object that has fulfilled its presumed definition\nso far will do so later on. Judgments on this question can be\nsupported by observations that make them more or less probable and\nthus subject to an appropriate level of doubt (ERCE [2020:\n99\u2013114]). Still, she admits there is one (but only one) possible\nbasis for skepticism about the reality of perceptual objects:\nexperience cannot show that the causes of all a person\u2019s\nsensations are not necessarily mixed with the causes of her dreams\n(EPEU [2020: 118\u201319]).\n",
