    "main_text": "Defining Omniscience\n1. Defining Omniscience\nSince omniscience is maximal or complete knowledge, it is typically defined in terms of knowledge of all true propositions, namely, as\n\n(D1) S is omniscient \\(=_{\\textit{df}}\\) for every proposition p, if p is true then S knows p.\n\nOne might think it important to require, in addition, that an omniscient being also knows which propositions are false. In this case, (D1) could be replaced by\n\n(D2)S is omniscient \\(=_{\\textit{df}}\\) for every proposition p, if p is true then S knows p and for every proposition q, if q is false then S knows that q is false.\n\nThis revision is equivalent to (D1), however, given that for every false proposition there is a true one to the effect that the first one is false. (D1) already requires an omniscient being to know the latter proposition.\nOr one might add that omniscience not only requires knowing all truths but also believing no falsehoods. That is,\n\n(D3) S is omniscient \\(=_{\\textit{df}}\\) for every proposition p, if p is true then S knows p, and there is no proposition q such that q is false and S believes q.\n\nBut (D3) is also equivalent to (D1), at least if it is impossible to believe the denial of a proposition one knows to be true, knows that one knows to be true, knows is the denial of a proposition one knows, etc. (Oppy (2014: 233) claims, more simply, that it is not possible to know a proposition if one believes its denial.) In the recent literature, Swinburne (1993: 167 and 2016: 175) states a version of (D1) (although in both works he later endorses restricted principles (1993: 181\u2013182 and 2016: 196) to yield what he calls an \u201cattenuated\u201d definition). Zagzebski (2007: 262) endorses (D2). Plantinga ([1974] 1977: 68), Davis (1983: 26), Gale (1991: 57), Craig (1991:6), and others propose (D3).\nSeveral recent discussions of omniscience have attempted to defend a more restricted account than offered by the preceding definitions. For example, Langtry (2008: 39) suggests that God is omniscient just in case, for every true proposition p, \u201ceither God knows that p, or else he does not but his knowing that p is not precluded by any defect or limitation in his intrinsic cognitive capacities.\u201d Nagasawa (2017) claims that a stronger version of perfect being theology would hold that God has a \u201cmaximally consistent set\u201d of the divine attributes of knowledge, power, and benevolence. This would allow that a perfect being could be omniscient without knowing all truths, if knowing all truths would reduce the amount of power or benevolence the being could possess. Another departure from the traditional understanding presented above appeals to feminist epistemology. See the Section 3.1 of the entry on feminist philosophy of religion, which hints at this possibility in its discussion of \u201cso-called divine attributes\u201d, although it limits its discussion to perfect power and divine aseity. Farmer (2010), however, draws more directly on feminist epistemology as an application to understanding omniscience. The negative claim in this work is that \u201cpropositional ideals of human knowledge\u201d exclude \u201cmarginalized and maligned\u201d forms of knowledge. Thus omniscience could be better understood by appealing, positively, to these other forms of knowledge. Farmer cites \u201cknowing other people in personal relationships\u201d, the \u201ccentrality of care\u201d which leads to \u201cthe acknowledgement of the otherness of the object of knowledge\u201d, and the role of emotion in leading to knowledge. (Farmer cites (Code, 1993), (Dalmiya 2002), and (Jaggar 1989), respectively, for these ideas.) However this approach is to be worked out, the intention is that omniscience would not simply be defined by reference to knowledge of true propositions.\nAnother recent development might also be seen as recommending a different account of omniscience. This is the suggestion, presented most prominently by Zagzebski, that God has the attribute of omnisubjectivity. According to Zagzebski, omnisubjectivity is \u201cthe property of consciously grasping with perfect accuracy and completeness the first-person perspective of every conscious being\u201d (2008: 232). She adds that \u201cGod\u2019s knowledge of our conscious lives is something like the perfection of empathy\u201d (2008: 236). Since grasping someone\u2019s subjective experience seems not to be propositional, perhaps the suggestion is that omniscience involves more than knowledge of propositions. But Zagebski\u2019s claim is, rather, that omnisubjectivity is entailed by omniscience (2008: 232) or entailed by the conjunction of omniscience and omnipresence (2016: 436), so it is perhaps better thought of a further extension of divine cognitive perfection and not a rejection of the definitions listed above.\nDespite this recent work on omniscience, the main disputes in the literature center on the traditional definition of omniscience; accordingly, this entry will concentrate on them. These disputes have focused on the scope of the quantifier in (D1), whether, for example, it includes propositions about the future, whether (D1) requires an omniscient being to change as time goes by, whether it requires enough for maximal knowledge, and whether it (falsely) presupposes that there is a set of all truths.\n",
