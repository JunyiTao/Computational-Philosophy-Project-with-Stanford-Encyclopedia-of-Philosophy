    "main_text": "Socialist Institutional Designs (Dimension DII)\n4. Socialist Institutional Designs (Dimension DII)\n\nThe foregoing discussion focused on socialist critiques of capitalism.\nThese critiques make the case that capitalism fails to fulfill\nprinciples, or to realize values, to which socialists are committed.\nBut what would an alternative economic system look like which would\nfulfill those principles, or realize those values\u2014or at least\nhonor them to a larger extent? This brings us to dimension DII of\nsocialism. We will consider several proposed models. We will address\nhere critical concerns about both the feasibility and the desirability\nof these models. Arguments comparing ideal socialist designs with\nactual capitalist societies are unsatisfactory; we must compare like\nwith like (Nove 1991; Brennan 2014; Corneo 2017). Thus, we should\ncompare ideal forms of socialism with ideal forms of capitalism, and\nactual versions of capitalism with actual versions of socialism. Most\nimportantly, we should entertain comparisons between the best feasible\nincarnations of these systems. This requires formulating feasible\nforms of socialism. Feasibility assessments can play out in two ways:\nthey may regard the (degree of) workability and stability of a\nproposed socialist system once introduced, or they may regard its\n(degree of) accessibility from current conditions when it is not yet\nin place. We address the former concerns in this section, leaving the\nlatter for\n section 5\n when we turn to dimension DIII of socialism and the questions of\nsocialist transition or transformation.\n",
