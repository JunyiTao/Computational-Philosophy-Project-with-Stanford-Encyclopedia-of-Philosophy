    "main_text": "Philosophical Relevance || Critique of Cognitive Science\n5.3 Philosophy of Cognitive Science\n\nCognitive science raises many interesting methodological questions\nthat are worthy of investigation by philosophers of science. What is\nthe nature of representation? What role do computational models play\nin the development of cognitive theories? What is the relation among\napparently competing accounts of mind involving symbolic processing,\nneural networks, and dynamical systems? What is the relation among the\nvarious fields of cognitive science such as psychology, linguistics,\nand neuroscience? Are psychological phenomena subject to reductionist\nexplanations via neuroscience? Are levels of explanation best\ncharacterized in terms of ontological levels (molecular, neural,\npsychological, social) or methodological ones (computational,\nalgorithmic, physical)?\n\nThe increasing prominence of neural explanations in cognitive, social,\ndevelopmental, and clinical psychology raises important philosophical\nquestions about\n explanation\n and\n reduction.\n Anti-reductionism, according to which psychological explanations are\ncompletely independent of neurological ones, is becoming increasingly\nimplausible, but it remains controversial to what extent psychology\ncan be reduced to neuroscience and molecular biology. Crucial to\nanswering questions about the nature of reduction are answers to\nquestions about the nature of explanation. Explanations in psychology,\nneuroscience, and biology in general are plausibly viewed as\ndescriptions of\n mechanisms,\n which are combinations of connected parts that interact to produce\nregular changes. In psychological explanations, the parts are mental\nrepresentations that interact by computational procedures to produce\nnew representations. In neuroscientific explanations, the parts are\nneural populations that interact by electrochemical processes to\nproduce new neural activity that leads to actions. If progress in\ntheoretical neuroscience continues, it should become possible to tie\npsychological to neurological explanations by showing how mental\nrepresentations such as concepts are constituted by activities in\nneural populations, and how computational procedures such as spreading\nactivation among concepts are carried out by neural processes.\n\nThe increasing integration of cognitive psychology with neuroscience\nprovides evidence for the\n mind-brain identity theory\n according to which mental processes are neural, representational, and\ncomputational. Other philosophers dispute such identification on the\ngrounds that minds are embodied in biological systems and extended\ninto the world. However, moderate claims about embodiment are\nconsistent with the identity theory because brain representations\noperate in several modalities (e.g. visual and motor) that enable\nminds to deal with the world. Another materialist alternative to\nmind-brain identity comes from recognizing that explanations of mind\nemploy molecular and social mechanisms as well as neural and\nrepresentational ones.\n",
