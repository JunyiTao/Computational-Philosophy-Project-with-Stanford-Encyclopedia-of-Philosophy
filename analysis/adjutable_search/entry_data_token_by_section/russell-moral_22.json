    "main_text": "Russell\u2019s Humean Wobble: Human Society in Ethics and Politics\n11. Russell\u2019s Humean Wobble: Human Society in Ethics and Politics\n\nRussell\u2019s Human Society is a fun book to read, but\nmeta-ethically it is a bit of a mess. There is much wit and some\nwisdom, though both the wit and the wisdom are more conspicuous when\nhe is discussing human nature and human society than when he is\ndiscussing the finer points of ethical theory. (I particularly like\nhis frequent complaints that human behavior seldom rises to the level\nof enlightened self-interest. If only we could manage to be\nintelligently selfish, the world would be a much better place.) The\ndrift of the argument is sometimes difficult to discern, partly\nbecause of has frequent digressions to make bon mots, and\npartly because of his dialectical method of presentation, which\napproaches what he takes to be the truth via a series of successive\napproximations. Human Society in Ethics and Politics was\npublished in 1954, but the meta-ethical bits were originally written\nsome years earlier and intended for inclusion in Human Knowledge:\nIts Scope and Limits (1948). Russell held them back because he\nwas not sure whether ethical propositions rose to the dignity of\nknowledge. He continued to be doubtful about this, but by the early\n1950s his doubts had sufficiently dissipated for publication to become\na possibility. Nevertheless, there are marked analogies between the\ntwo books. Human Knowledge attempts to establish the\nexistence of a mind-independent world on the basis of private\nperceptions. Human Society attempts to establish an ethic\nthat is in some degree independent of individual minds on the\nbasis of subjective sentiments.\n\nHume looms large in Russell\u2019s Human Knowledge. Indeed the\nwhole book can be seen as an attempt to concede the premises of Hume\u2019s\nskeptical argument\u2014that the data we start with are private and\npersonal and that we cannot infer an external world from such data by\nmeans of demonstrative inference\u2014whilst resisting its\nconclusion\u2014that we can have no knowledge of an external world.\n(Hence the need for non-demonstrative inference.) But although Hume\nwas Russell\u2019s chief opponent in Human Knowledge, he was\nperhaps a meta-ethical ally in Human Society. In the\nEnquiry Concerning the Principles of Moral, Hume sought to\nbase an inter-subjective ethic on human sentiments, specifically the\nsentiments of approbation and disapprobation. Hume was much more at\nease in the world than Russell, and was only interested in moral\nreform in so far as morals rested on the \u201cdelusive glosses of\nsuperstition and false religion\u201d (which in his opinion included\nall religion) or the ideological delusions of factious\npoliticians and mercantile economists. But he did want a meta-ethic\nthat would enable him to transfer the monkish virtues (whose status\nas virtues depended on the \u201cdelusive glosses\u201d)\nfrom the catalogue of virtues to the catalogue of vices. Thus he\nwanted to be able to show that those who approved of \u201ccelibacy,\nfasting, penance, mortification, self-denial, humility, silence,\nsolitude\u201d were making some kind of mistake. How did he\npropose to do this? By combining a definition with an empirical\nresearch program.\n\n\nThe hypothesis which we embrace is plain. It maintains that morality\nis determined by sentiment. It defines [my italics] virtue to\nbe whatever mental action or quality gives to a spectator the\npleasing sentiment of approbation; and vice the contrary. We then\nproceed to examine a plain matter of fact, to wit, what actions have\nthis influence. (Hume 1975 [1748]: 289)\n\n\nThe matter of fact is less plain than Hume suggests, since the\n\u201cspectator\u201d is an idealized observer, whose moral\nsense operates at optimum in part because (unlike the rest of us) he\nis relevantly informed. This means that we cannot simply predict the\nreactions of the spectator by observing the reactions of mankind,\nsince mankind is sometimes mistaken about the relevant facts. In\nparticular, since many people are subject to the delusive glosses of\nsuperstition and false religion, their reactions are liable to be\ndistorted by false beliefs, leading them to approve of what is really\nvicious (such as celibacy, fasting etc) and to disapprove of what is\nreally right (such as playing whist on Sundays with \u201cmodest\nwomen\u201d). Since a virtue is whatever mental action or quality\ngives to a [suitably qualified] spectator the pleasing\nsentiment of approbation, and since nobody would approve of\nfasting, celibacy etc if they did not think they would be\nuseful in procuring an agreeable afterlife, no\nsuitably qualified person would approve of them, since being suitably\nqualified involves not being subject to the delusive glosses\nof superstition and false religion. However Hume\u2019s meta-ethic rests\npartly on a definition (which Hume obviously conceives of as\nreporting a truth of language) and partly on the thesis that people\nshare the same moral sensibility which can therefore be\n\u201cidealized\u201d to serve as the criterion for virtue. In other\nwords Hume\u2019s theory rests on the presupposition that, given the same\ninformation, we would approve or disapprove of much the same\nthings.\n\nWhat about Russell? His theory, like Hume\u2019s rests on a set of\n\u201cfundamental propositions and definitions\u201d:\n\nSurveying the acts which arouse emotions of approval or\ndisapproval, we find that, as a general rule, the acts which are\napproved of are those believed likely to have, on the balance, effects\nof certain kinds, while opposite effects are expected from acts that\nare disapproved of.\nEffects that lead to approval are defined as \u201cgood\u201d,\nand those leading to disapproval as \u201cbad\u201d.\nAn act of which, on the available evidence, the effects are likely\nto be better than those of any other act that is possible in the\ncircumstances, is defined as \u201cright\u201d; any other act is\n\u201cwrong\u201d. What we \u201cought\u201d to do is, by\ndefinition, the act which is right.\n\n\n\nThese definitions and propositions, if accepted provide a coherent\nbody of propositions which are true (or false) in the same sense as if\nthey were propositions of science. (RoE:\n161\u2013162/Human Society in Ethics and Politics: 116)\n\n\nNow (1) is a variant of Sidgwick\u2019s thesis that common-sense moralities\ntend to solidify around rules which are believed to have generally\nbeneficial consequences, where the benefit is cashed out in terms of\nhuman welfare. It is a dubious thesis, especially as Russell himself\nhad argued that many traditional moralities foster the interests of\nthe elite at the expense of other groups\u2014foreigners, women,\nslaves and serfs. Perhaps Russell wants to exclude such moralities, by\nrestricting his claim to civilized communities, where\n\u201ccivilized\u201d rules out societies with blatantly elitist\nmoral codes. Thesis (2) purports to define \u201cgood effects\u201d,\nbut it does not state whose approval is to determine\ngoodness\u2014people in general, people at their impartial best, or\njust the enlightened and well-informed? Without some clarity on this\npoint, too many things will wind up as good, since for any likely\neffect there will be some weirdo somewhere who approves of it.\nConversely, if being disapproved of means that an effect is\nnot good, the class of good effects may vanish altogether,\nsince for any likely effect there will be some weirdo somewhere who\ndisapproves of it. Paradoxically given his long career as a\nmoral radical, Russell\u2019s meta-ethic seems to have less critical bite\nthan Hume\u2019s, at least as regards ends. Hume\u2019s theory allows him to\ntransfer a reputed virtue to the catalogue of vices if people approve\nof it on the basis of false beliefs. Russell seems to be stuck with\nwhatever effects people happen to approve of even if their tendency to\napprove is based on false beliefs and malodorous passions. But the\nreal problem lies with (3). It defines \u201cright\u201d and\n\u201cought\u201d in consequentialist terms and as we have seen (and\nas Russell himself had argued many years before) such a definition is\nclearly false, at least if it is construed as a report of current\nusage. It is not a tautology to say that the right thing to do is the\naction that seems likely to produce the best consequences, which it\nwould be if Russell\u2019s definition were correct.\n\nThe theory could be improved by retaining (1) and (2) with the class\nof approvers more carefully specified, but replacing (3) with\nsomething like:\n\n3a.\nThe right thing to do is defined as the action which an impartial,\ninformed and non-superstitious spectator would approve of doing.\n\n\nOn the assumption that the impartial spectator would retain the\nbroadly consequentialist tendencies of our rude ancestors, (1) and\n(3a) together would allow us to derive:\n\n3b.\nThe right thing to do is that action which seems likely to produce\nthe best effects.\n\n\nAnd this would be a moderately plausible synthetic claim rather than a\npatently false definition. Moreover, it would provide the basis for\nthe right kind of utilitarian ethic\u2014at least, it would do so if\nthe ethical jury in (2) is specified in such a way as to ensure that\nthey approve of the right effects.\n\nBut so far from being \u201ctrue in the same sense as if they were\npropositions of science\u201d, the definitions (2) and (3a) are\nsimply false, at least if they are construed as accounts of what the\nwords in question actually mean. Russell seems to have been aware of\nthis, as the tell-tale phrase \u201cif they are accepted\u201d\nindicates. Perhaps these definitions should be understood not as\nattempts to codify current usage but as proposals for linguistic\nreform (which, was a common dodge on the part of mid-century\nphilosophers when their purported analyses proved false). But in that\ncase they can be rejected without making any kind of mistake, along\nwith Russell\u2019s entire ethic. And what can be rejected without\nintellectual error can hardly qualify as knowledge.\n\nRussell himself may have agreed. He was not at all sure that there\nwas such a thing as ethical knowledge and soon reverted to\nhis earlier emotivism. Within one month of the publication of\nHuman Society he was expressing \u201ccomplete\nagreement\u201d with the emotivism of A.J. Ayer (RoE:\n165/Papers 11: 175). The reason, I suspect, is that he came\nto see that his definitions of \u2018right\u2019 and\n\u2018good\u2019 were intellectually optional. Some years later a Mr\nHarold Osborn sent him a book which attempted to provide an objective\nbasis for a humanistic ethic. Russell\u2019s letter of thanks points out a\nproblem: \u201cany system of ethics which claims objectivity can only\ndo so by means of a concealed ethical premise, which, if disputed,\ncannot be demonstrated\u201d (Dear Bertrand Russell: 98).\nThat is precisely what is wrong with Human Society in Ethics and\nPolitics.\n",
