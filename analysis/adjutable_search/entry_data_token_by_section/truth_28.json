    "main_text": "Truth and language || The coherence theory and meaning\n6.5 The coherence theory and meaning\n\nInspired by Quine (e.g., 1960), Davidson himself is well known for\ntaking a different approach to using a theory of truth as a theory of\nmeaning than is implicit in Field (1972). Whereas a Field-inspired\nrepresentational approach is based on a causal account of reference,\nDavidson (e.g., 1973) proposes a process of radical\ninterpretation in which an interpreter builds a Tarskian theory\nto interpret a speaker as holding beliefs which are consistent,\ncoherent, and largely true.\n\nThis led Davidson (e.g. 1986) to argue that most of our beliefs are\ntrue \u2013 a conclusion that squares well with the coherence theory\nof truth. This is a weaker claim than the neo-classical coherence\ntheory would make. It does not insist that all the members of any\ncoherent set of beliefs are true, or that truth simply consists in\nbeing a member of such a coherent set. But all the same, the\nconclusion that most of our beliefs are true, because their contents\nare to be understood through a process of radical interpretation which\nwill make them a coherent and rational system, has a clear affinity\nwith the neo-classical coherence theory.\n\nIn Davidson (1986), he thought his view of truth had enough affinity\nwith the neo-classical coherence theory to warrant being called a\ncoherence theory of truth, while at the same time he saw the role of\nTarskian apparatus as warranting the claim that his view was also\ncompatible with a kind of correspondence theory of truth.\n\nIn later work, however, Davidson reconsidered this position. In fact,\nalready in Davidson (1977) he had expressed doubt about any\nunderstanding of the role of Tarski\u2019s theory in radical\ninterpretation that involves the kind of representational apparatus\nrelied on by Field (1972), as we discussed in sections 3.1 and 3.2. In\nthe \u201cAfterthoughts\u201d to Davidson (1986), he also concluded\nthat his view departs too far from the neo-classical coherence theory\nto be named one. What is important is rather the role of radical\ninterpretation in the theory of content, and its leading to the idea\nthat belief is veridical. These are indeed points connected to\ncoherence, but not to the coherence theory of truth per se. They also\ncomprise a strong form of anti-representationalism. Thus, though he\ndoes not advance a coherence theory of truth, he does advance a theory\nthat stands in opposition to the representational variants of the\ncorrespondence theory we discussed in section 3.2.\n\nFor more on Davidson, see Glanzberg (2013) and the entry on\n Donald Davidson.\n",
