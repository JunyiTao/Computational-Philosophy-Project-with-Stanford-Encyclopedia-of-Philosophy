    "main_text": "Fundamentals || Neural Correlates of Consciousness\n1.6 Neural Correlates of Consciousness\n\nModern neuroscience of consciousness has attempted to explain\nconsciousness by focusing on neural correlates of\nconsciousness or NCCs (Crick & Koch 1998, 2003). Identifying\ncorrelates is an important first step in understanding consciousness,\nbut it is an early step. After all, correlates are not necessarily\nexplanatory in the sense of answering specific questions posed by\nneuroscience. That one does not want a mere correlate was recognized\nby Chalmers who defined an NCC as follows:\n\n\nAn NCC is a minimal neural system N such that there is a\nmapping from states of N to states of consciousness, where a\ngiven state of N is sufficient under conditions C, for\nthe corresponding state of consciousness. (Chalmers 2000: 31)\n\n\nSimilarly, Christof Koch and others speak of \u201cthe minimal neural\nmechanisms jointly sufficient for any one specific conscious\nexperience\u201d (Koch et al. 2016: 307). One wants a minimal neural\nsystem since, crudely put, the brain is sufficient for consciousness\nbut to point this out is hardly to explain consciousness even if it\nprovides an answer to questions about sufficiency. There is, of\ncourse, much more to be said that is informative even if one does not\ndrill down to a \u201cminimal\u201d neural system which is tricky to\ndefine or operationalize (see Chalmers 2000 for discussion; for\ncriticisms of the NCC approach, see No\u00eb & Thompson 2004; for\ncriticisms of Chalmers\u2019 definition, see Fink 2016).\n\nThe emphasis on sufficiency goes beyond mere correlation, as\nneuroscientists aim to answer more than the question: What is a neural\ncorrelate for conscious phenomenon C? For example,\nChalmers\u2019 and Koch\u2019s emphases on sufficiency indicate that\nthey aim to answer the question: What neural phenomenon is sufficient\nfor consciousness? Perhaps more specifically: What neural phenomenon\nis causally sufficient for consciousness? Accordingly, talk of\n\u201ccorrelate\u201d is unfortunate since sufficiency implies\ncorrelation but not vice versa. For example, correlation does not\nimply causal sufficiency, so not every correlate will be explanatory\nin the sense of answering Chalmers\u2019 and Koch\u2019s question.\nAfter all, assume that the NCC is type identical to a conscious state.\nThen many neural states will correlate with the conscious state: (1)\nthe NCC\u2019s typical effects, (2) its typical causes, and (3)\nstates that are necessary for the NCCs obtaining (e.g., the presence\nof sufficient oxygen). Thus, some correlated effects will not be\nexplanatory. For example, citing the effects of consciousness will not\nprovide causally sufficient conditions for consciousness.\n\nWhile many theorists are focused on explanatory correlates, it is not\nclear that the field has always grasped this, something recent\ntheorists have been at pains to emphasize (Graaf, Hsieh, & Sack\n2012; Aru et al. 2012; Koch et al. 2016). In other contexts,\nneuroscientists speak of the neural basis of a phenomenon\nwhere the basis does not simply correlate with the phenomenon but also\nexplains and possibly grounds it. However, talk of correlates is\nentrenched in the neuroscience of consciousness, so one must remember\nthat the goal is to find the subset of neural correlates that are\nexplanatory, in answering concrete questions. Reference to neural\ncorrelates in this entry will always mean neural explanatory correlate\nof consciousness (on occasion, I will speak of these as the neural\nbasis of consciousness). That is, our two questions about\nspecific and generic consciousness focus the discussion on\nneuroscientific theories and data that contribute to explaining them.\nThis project allows that there are limits to neural explanations of\nconsciousness, precisely because of the explanatory gap (Levine\n1983).\n",
