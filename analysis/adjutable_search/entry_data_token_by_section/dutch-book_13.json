    "main_text": "Other Uses of Dutch Book Arguments || The Principal Principle\n5.2 The Principal Principle\nRecently, Richard Pettigrew (2020) has offered a Dutch Book\nargument for Lewis\u2019 Principal Principle as an additional\nconstraint on rational credences.  The Principal Principle requires\nthat an agent\u2019s credences about chances be such that her\ncredence for the proposition, \\(A\\) conditional on the chance of \\(A\\)\nbeing \\(r\\), is equal to \\(r\\).  Supposing that \\(\\text{cr}\\)\nis the agent\u2019s credence function and \\(\\text{ch}\\) a chance\nfunction such that \\(\\text{ch}(A) = r\\) says that the chance\nof \\(A\\) is \\(r\\), the requirement is that\n\\(\\text{cr}(A/\\text{ch}(A) = r) = r\\).  The principle has a similar\nstructure to the Principle of Reflection, with the chance of \\(A\\) at\nthe current time t in place of the agent's credence in \\(A\\) at a\nfuture time \\(t\\). So, it is not so surprising that if\n\\(\\text{cr}(A/\\text{ch}(A) = r) \\neq r\\), there is a collection of\nbets in accordance with those credences that produce a kind of Dutch\nBook.  For details see Pettigrew (2020).  However, there are\nsignificant differences between the arguments for the Principal\nPrinciple and that for the Reflection Principle.  First, since the\nagent\u2019s future credences do not figure in the Principal\nPrinciple, the bets are part of a Dutch Book proper, rather than a\nDutch Strategy.  While this avoids some concerns about Dutch Strategy\narguments, a problematic difference is that the bets, which are given\nin terms of chances do not guarantee a sure loss, but only an expected\none, whatever the chances may be.\nFor Ramsey and de Finetti, the point of appealing to a Dutch Book\nargument was to establish probabilistic constraints using precise\nterms that were tied to verifiable conditions, making it crucial that\nthe bets constituting a book are given definite payoff conditions and\ncan be settled. However, the book against the violator of the\nPrincipal Principle involves bets on chances, which lack the\ndefinitive settlement conditions that would produce a sure loss. To\nthe extent that the underlying problem associated with Dutch Book\nvulnerability lies with the agent\u2019s evaluations rather than\nmerely with their pragmatic consequences, as discussed previously, the\nlack of a sure loss here may not be crucial. Still, the motivation for\ntaking the Dutch Book vulnerability in cases where the probability\naxioms are violated as an indication of irrationality appears to\nderive from the idea that it leads to a sure loss, so that the merely\nexpected loss associated with violating the Principal Principle, is\nless clearly irrational. In particular, credences that are associated\nwith a mere expectation of loss, rather than a sure loss, are less\nclearly held to indicate an inconsistency in the agent\u2019s action\nguiding evaluations. Such credences may still be irrational, but\nclarifying the source seems to require appealing to the nature of\nchance, which remains unsettled.\n",
