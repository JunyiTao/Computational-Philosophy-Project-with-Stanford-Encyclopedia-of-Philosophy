    "main_text": "Different Flavors of Adaptationism || Empirical Adaptationism\n2.1 Empirical Adaptationism\n\n\n Godfrey-Smith (2001, page\n336) defined empirical adaptationism as follows: \u201cNatural\nselection is a powerful and ubiquitous force, and there are few\nconstraints on the biological variation that fuels it. To a large\ndegree, it is possible to predict and explain the outcome of\nevolutionary processes by attending only to the role played by\nselection. No other evolutionary factor has this degree of causal\nimportance.\u201d\n\n\n This definition captures two\nimportant beliefs of adaptationists. The first is that natural\nselection governs all important aspects of trait evolution and that\nother evolutionary influences will be of little consequence at least\nover the long term. The second is that the order in nature is a\nconsequence of natural selection. Parker and Maynard Smith (1990) is an\nimportant example of this approach.\n\n\n Empirical adaptationism is typically regarded as descriptive of the\nevolution of directly observable traits such as leg length (e.g.,\nVella 2008). A dizzying variety of traits has been analyzed from the\nperspective of empirical adaptationism; many specific examples can be\nfound in Hardy (2002), Stephens et al. (2007), and Westneat\nand Fox (2010). Many proponents of empirical adaptationism concede\nthat important aspects of the evolution of DNA and protein sequences\nare little influenced by natural selection.\n\n\n The important methodological\nimplication of empirical adaptationism stems from the causal power that\nit assigns to natural selection: an apparent discrepancy between data\nand the predictions of an optimality model should be resolved by\nrejection of that model and development of a new model. This is\njustified by an appeal to our \u201calways\u201d imperfect knowledge\nof nature (e.g. see Cain 1989). This contrasts with the pluralist\nperspective: such a discrepancy might well provide evidence against\nnatural selection.\n\n\n Many views counter to empirical\nadaptationism have been enunciated. Some dispense with natural\nselection entirely (or nearly so), such as in the study of molecular\nevolution, where there are neutral evolutionary explanations for many\nfeatures of the genome (e.g., Lynch 2007b). Some retain natural\nselection within populations as an important evolutionary force but\nendorse the importance of other forces (e.g., Crespi 2000, Goodwin\n2001, Carroll 2005), while others go further and invoke natural\nselection among populations or species along with natural selection\nwithin populations (Gould 2002, Jablonski 2008).\n",
