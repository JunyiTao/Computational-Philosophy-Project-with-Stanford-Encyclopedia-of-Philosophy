    "main_text": "Other Examples of Replicators || The Extended Replicator\n4.3 The Extended Replicator\n\nSome of Dawkins\u2019 critics think that genes play too important a\nrole in his notion of replication. Replication, so they argue, can\noccur at other levels of organization as well. Just as Dawkins\nextended the notion of the phenotype, these authors propose to make\nthe notion of replicators more general as well\u2014to extend the\nreplicator so to speak. Dawkins introduced his Extended\nPhenotype conception for two reasons. First, he wanted to extend\nthe notion of a \u201cphenotypic trait\u201d. The sort of nest that\na bird builds or the song that it sings can count as phenotypic traits\njust as much as the shape of its bill. Second, as mentioned earlier,\nDawkins wanted to break the hold that organisms have over how we\nconceptualize the living world. Traits do tend to come bundled into\nreasonably discrete entities; but, for making inferences about the\nevolutionary process, traits can be treated as separate and distinct.\nHowever, as he proceeded, Dawkins eventually decided that extending\nthe phenotype was not enough. He had to bury it. All sorts of\nfascinating mechanisms to one side, what really matters in selection\ntakes place at the level of replicators.\n\nAlthough such critics of Dawkins as Sterelny, Smith, and Dickison\n(1996) declined to join with Dawkins in his demotion of environmental\ninteraction, they did agree with him that replicators are special.\nThey play a special role in development. However, they do not limit\nreplicators to genes, even in biological evolution. Sterelny et al.\npropose to extend the replicator to include nonstandard entities:\n\u201cthe set of developmental resources that are adapted from the\ntransmission of similarity across the generations\u201d (Sterelny\n2001: 338). For example, the sort of burrow that a particular organism\ndigs is influenced by its genetic makeup; however, if these burrows\nare used over and over again, characteristics of these burrows can\nthemselves be viewed as replicators. The effects of these burrows get\npassed on from generation to generation, but not via the DNA.\n\nAs more and more non-DNA replicators, including epigenetic\ninheritance, are acknowledged, Dawkins\u2019 view began to grade into\nthe conception of the Extended Replicator, which Sterelny et al.\n(1996) specify as any non-genetic as well as genetic replicators where\n\u201cgenetic\u201d refers to DNA. These two views are so\ngeneral that any case that can be described in one can be redescribed\nin the other. Differences lie in ease of description. According to\nSterelny et al. (1996), the burrows that some organisms dig can\nfunction as replicators\u2014extended replicators\u2014while Dawkins\nportrays them as instances of extended phenotypes. The contrast is\nbetween selfish burrows and selfish genes for burrowing.\n\nIn the version of replication formulated by Sterelny et al. (1996),\nboth copying and biofunction are crucial. Copying is quite obviously a\ncausal phenomenon, but not any old causal connection will do.\nSimilarity of copies is necessary but not sufficient. These\ncopies must be copies of copies. One copy must produce another copy\nand that copy produce still another copy and so on. For one entity to\nbe a copy of another, it must be the output of a process whose\nbiofunction is to conserve function. The function of copying is to\nproduce from one token another token, which is similar in the relevant\nrespects. Genes fit this definition, but so do lots of examples of\nnon-genetic transmission, such as habitat stability resulting from\nnest site imprinting, the song that a bird learns, and various\nmicroorganism symbionts, not to mention sociocultural\ntransmission.\n",
