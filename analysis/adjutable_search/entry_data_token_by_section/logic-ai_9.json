    "main_text": "Contextual Reasoning\n11. Contextual Reasoning\n\n\nIn the tradition in philosophical logic dealing with contextual\neffects on the interpretation of expressions, as well as in the more\nrecent tradition in dynamic logic, context is primarily formalized as\nan assignment of values to variables, and the language is designed to\nmake explicit reasoning about context either very limited or outright\nimpossible.\n\n\nConcern in AI about the representation of large and apparently\nheterogeneous domains and about the integration of disparate knowledge\nsources, as well as interests in formalizing common sense of the sort\ndiscussed in\n Section 2.2,\n above, have led to\ninterest in the AI community in formalizing languages that take context\ninto account more explicitly.\n\n\nIn\n McCarthy 1993b,\n McCarthy\nrecommends the study of languages containing a construct\nist(c,\u03c6),\n\n\nwhere ist is read \u201cis-true.\u201d This is analogous to the\nHolds construct of the situation calculus\u2014but now\nc stands for a context, and \u03c6 is a possibly complex\npropositional representation, which many (including McCarthy) take to\nrefer to a sentence. \n\n\nThere are analogies here both to modal logic and to languages with an\nexplicit truth predicate. But the applications that are envisioned for\na logic of context create opportunities and problems that are in many\nways new.  Work on the logic of context subsequent to McCarthy\u2019s\noriginal suggestion, includes \nMcCarthy &\nBuvac 1998, Guha 1991, and some of\nthe papers in the conference volumes\nAkman et al. 2001,\n Bouquet et al. 1999.\nFor extensions of Richard Montague\u2019s Intensional Logic motivated by\nMcCarthy\u2019s suggestions, see Thomason 2003\nand 2005.\n\n\nFor some reason, work on the explicit formalization of context hasn\u2019t\nbeen actively pursued by the computational community beyond this point.\nPhilosophical interest in context, and especially in the interaction\nof context with propositional attitudes and modals, continues to be\nstrong; but the very general logical frameworks for context that \nMcCarthy envisioned have yet not been taken up by philosophers.\n",
