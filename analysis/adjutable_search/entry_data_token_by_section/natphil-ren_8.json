    "main_text": "Aristotelian Tenets, Platonic Tenets, and More || Miracles, Magic, and Physiognomy\n4.4 Natural Philosophy and Religion\n\nMany of the doctrines of natural philosophy contrasted with the\nteachings of religion, and there were a number of possible solutions\nto this problem. Some authors appealed to the radical difference\nbetween the realms of faith and philosophy, relying on the Averroistic\n(even if not formulated by Averroes himself) doctrine of the\n\u201cdouble truth\u201d. This was the case, for example, of Pietro\nPomponazzi. Yet other authors, such as Bessarion or Simone Porzio, who\ncame from very different backgrounds, rejected any confusion between\nphilosophy and faith at the latter\u2019s expense (even though\nBessarion, like Ficino, argued for a greater compatibility between\nPlatonism and Christianity). There were also others, like the Jesuit\nPedro da Fonseca (1528\u20131599), who considered Plato\u2019s\nnatural philosophy too dangerously similar to Christianity and\ntherefore preferred the Aristotelian paradigm. On the other hand, some\nthinkers tried instead to genuinely reconcile philosophy and faith,\nparticularly during the periods of doctrinal conflict and religious\nwarfare that followed the Reformation. This was particularly true in\nProtestant countries, where even at the end of the sixteenth century\nthe problem of the double truth was a matter of intense debate.\nReformed scholars displayed a clear bias against Aristotle, the\nphilosopher who they held responsible for sustaining the scholastic\nedifice of Catholic theology, and in Wittenberg they even mounted a\nshort-lived attempt to replace him with Pliny: but the disordered\napproach of the Natural History made it unsuitable for\nsuperseding the Aristotelian encyclopedia for teaching. Philipp\nMelanchthon (1497\u20131560) reconciled the distinction between\nreligion and science of nature by arguing that nature was creation of\nGod and everything in it had to be seen as the work of providence.\nSome philosophers, such as John Amos Comenius (1592\u20131670),\nsupported the alliance between natural science and religion by arguing\nfor a philosophy based on the biblical teachings, even though this\nposition was often intended to combat the excess of natural\nphilosophers rather than to offer an alternative system. However, both\nin Protestant and Catholic contexts, scientists like Rheticus\n(1514\u20131574) and Galileo denied that the Bible had any scientific\nvalue (yet, refusing tout court the divine role in the\nexplanation of Biblical events such as the Genesis flood, in favor a\nof a fully natural account, as Camilla Erculiani suggested in 1584,\nwas likely to cause the intervention of the Roman Inquisition).\nScholars like John Case (d. 1600), who considered Aristotelianism\ncompatible with Christian dogmas such as creation and divine\nprovidence, were particularly fond of searching for ways to syncretize\ntheology with natural philosophy. Attempts to reconcile the\nPhilosopher with the Christian religion, even at the cost of relying\non forced or fanciful readings, were still being made in the\nseventeenth century. Descartes will solve the interferences between\nnatural science and religion by limiting the former to the\ninvestigation of finite objects, the only ones accessible to human\nbeings. Yet, by posing limits to human knowledge, he also rejected an\nanthropocentric view of the creation.\n\nNor were these problems confined to Christian learned contexts: they\nwere the subject of a number of similar reflections within the Jewish\ntradition as well. Jewish thinkers often considered natural science a\nmere system of hypotheses, which was capable of grasping only the\nsuperficial appearance of things, and was subordinate to the absolute\ntruth offered by the Torah. This position was defended by authors such\nas Judah Loew ben Bezalel (also known as Maharal, 1520\u20131609),\nwho posited a radical distinction between the natural world and the\nteachings of Torah, as well as Azariah Figo (1579\u20131547). In\nparticular, Loew claimed that while it was possible to illuminate and\nexplain the natural order of the physical world, this was not true of\nthe relationship between God and the creation. This attitude was\nprobably in part due to Jews\u2019 sense of exclusion and\nmarginalization from the institutions where natural philosophy was\ntaught and practiced (an important exception to this rule was Italy,\nwhere personalities like Elijah del Medigo (circa 1458\u20131493)\ntook advantage of the separation between science and theology in the\nuniversities). Nonetheless, all of these Jewish authors\u2014both the\nItalian \u201cfree-thinkers\u201d and those who defended the\nsuperiority of the Torah\u2014still relied on Aristotle as the main\nauthority for natural philosophy, and there were multiple attempts by\nphilosophers like Ioseph ben Shem Tov (circa 1400\u2013circa 1480)\nand Abraham Farissol (1451\u2013circa 1525) to integrate the\nStagirite within the Hebraic philosophical tradition. A minority of\nJewish authors, including Moses Isserles (1520\u20131572), considered\nnatural philosophy a useful tool for demonstrating the glory of God.\n\n",
