    "main_text": "Symmetry Breaking || Spontaneous symmetry breaking\n4.2 Spontaneous symmetry breaking\n\nSpontaneous symmetry breaking (SSB) occurs in a situation where, given\na symmetry of the equations of motion, solutions exist which are not\ninvariant under the action of this symmetry without any explicit\nasymmetric input (whence the attribute\n \u201cspontaneous\u201d).[16]\n A situation of this type can be first illustrated by means of simple\ncases taken from classical physics. Consider for example the case of a\nlinear vertical stick with a compression force applied on the top and\ndirected along its axis. The physical description is obviously\ninvariant for all rotations around this axis. As long as the applied\nforce is mild enough, the stick does not bend and the equilibrium\nconfiguration (the lowest energy configuration) is invariant under\nthis symmetry. When the force reaches a critical value, the symmetric\nequilibrium configuration becomes unstable and an infinite number of\nequivalent lowest energy stable states appear, which are no longer\nrotationally symmetric but are related to each other by a rotation.\nThe actual breaking of the symmetry may then easily occur by effect of\na (however small) external asymmetric cause, and the stick bends until\nit reaches one of the infinite possible stable asymmetric equilibrium\n configurations.[17]\n In substance, what happens in the above kind of situation is the\nfollowing: when some parameter reaches a critical value, the lowest\nenergy solution respecting the symmetry of the theory ceases to be\nstable under small perturbations and new asymmetric (but stable)\nlowest energy solutions appear. The new lowest energy solutions are\nasymmetric but are all related through the action of the symmetry\ntransformations. In other words, there is a degeneracy (infinite or\nfinite depending on whether the symmetry is continuous or discrete) of\ndistinct asymmetric solutions of identical (lowest) energy, the whole\nset of which maintains the symmetry of the theory.\n\nIn quantum physics SSB actually does not occur in the case of\nfinite systems: tunnelling takes place between the various degenerate\nstates, and the true lowest energy state or \u201cground state\u201d\nturns out to be a unique linear superposition of the degenerate\nstates. In fact, SSB is applicable only to infinite systems \u2014\nmany-body systems (such as ferromagnets, superfluids and\nsuperconductors) and fields \u2014 the alternative degenerate ground\nstates being all orthogonal to each other in the infinite volume limit\nand therefore separated by a \u201csuperselection rule\u201d (see\nfor example Weinberg, 1996, pp. 164\u2013165).\n\nHistorically, the concept of SSB first emerged in condensed matter\nphysics. The prototype case is the 1928 Heisenberg theory of the\nferromagnet as an infinite array of spin 1/2 magnetic dipoles, with\nspin-spin interactions between nearest neighbours such that\nneighbouring dipoles tend to align. Although the theory is\nrotationally invariant, below the critical Curie temperature\nTc the actual ground state of the\nferromagnet has the spin all aligned in some particular direction\n(i.e. a magnetization pointing in that direction), thus not respecting\nthe rotational symmetry. What happens is that below\nTc there exists an infinitely degenerate\nset of ground states, in each of which the spins are all aligned in a\ngiven direction. A complete set of quantum states can be built upon\neach ground state. We thus have many different \u201cpossible\nworlds\u201d (sets of solutions to the same equations), each one\nbuilt on one of the possible orthogonal (in the infinite volume limit)\nground states. To use a famous image by S. Coleman, a little man\nliving inside one of these possible asymmetric worlds would have a\nhard time detecting the rotational symmetry of the laws of nature (all\nhis experiments being under the effect of the background magnetic\nfield). The symmetry is still there \u2014 the Hamiltonian being\nrotationally invariant \u2014 but \u201chidden\u201d to the little\nman. Besides, there would be no way for the little man to detect\ndirectly that the ground state of his world is part of an infinitely\ndegenerate multiplet. To go from one ground state of the infinite\nferromagnet to another would require changing the directions of an\ninfinite number of dipoles, an impossible task for the finite little\nman (Coleman, 1975, pp. 141\u2013142). As said, in the infinite\nvolume limit all ground states are separated by a superselection rule.\nRuetsche (2006) discusses symmetry breaking and ferromagnetism from\nthe algebraic perspective. Liu and Emch (2005) address the\ninterpretative problems of explaining SSB in nonrelativistic quantum\nstatistical mechanics. Fraser (2016) discusses SBB in finite systems,\narguing against the indispensability of the thermodynamic limit in the\ncharacterization of SSB in statistical mechanics.\n\nThe same picture can be generalized to quantum field theory\n(QFT), the ground state becoming the vacuum state, and the\nrole of the little man being played by ourselves. This means that\nthere may exist symmetries of the laws of nature which are not\nmanifest to us because the physical world in which we live is built on\na vacuum state which is not invariant under them. In other words, the\nphysical world of our experience can appear to us very asymmetric, but\nthis does not necessarily mean that this asymmetry belongs to the\nfundamental laws of nature. SSB offers a key for understanding (and\nutilizing) this physical possiblity.\n\nThe concept of SSB was transferred from condensed matter physics to\nQFT in the early 1960s, thanks especially to works by Y. Nambu and G.\nJona-Lasinio. Jona-Lasinio (2003) offers a first-hand account of how\nthe idea of SSB was introduced and formalized in particle physics on\nthe grounds of an analogy with the breaking of (electromagnetic) gauge\nsymmetry in the 1957 theory of superconductivity by J. Bardeen, L. N.\nCooper and J. R. Schrieffer (the so-called BCS theory). The\napplication of SSB to particle physics in the 1960s and successive\nyears led to profound physical consequences and played a fundamental\nrole in the edification of the current Standard Model of elementary\nparticles. In particular, let us mention the following main results\nthat obtain in the case of the spontaneous breaking of a continous\ninternal symmetry in QFT.\n\nGoldstone theorem. In the case of a global continuous\nsymmetry, massless bosons (known as \u201cGoldstone bosons\u201d)\nappear with the spontaneous breakdown of the symmetry according to a\ntheorem first stated by J. Goldstone in 1960. The presence of these\nmassless bosons, first seen as a serious problem since no particles of\nthe sort had been observed in the context considered, was in fact the\nbasis for the solution \u2014 by means of the so-called Higgs\nmechanism (see the next point) \u2014 of another similar problem,\nthat is the fact that the 1954 Yang-Mills theory of non-Abelian gauge\nfields predicted unobservable massless particles, the gauge\nbosons.\n\nHiggs mechanism. According to a \u201cmechanism\u201d\nestablished in a general way in 1964 independently by (i) P. Higgs,\n(ii) R. Brout and F. Englert, and (iii) G. S. Guralnik, C. R. Hagen\nand T. W. B. Kibble, in the case that the internal symmetry is\npromoted to a local one, the Goldstone bosons \u201cdisappear\u201d\nand the gauge bosons acquire a mass. The Goldstone bosons are\n\u201ceaten up\u201d to give mass to the gauge bosons, and this\nhappens without (explicitly) breaking the gauge invariance of the\ntheory. Note that this mechanism for the mass generation for the gauge\nfields is also what ensures the renormalizability of theories\ninvolving massive gauge fields (such as the Glashow-Weinberg-Salam\nelectroweak theory developed in the second half of the 1960s), as\nfirst generally demonstrated by M. Veltman and G. \u2019t Hooft in\nthe early 1970s. The Higgs mechanism it at the center of a lively\ndebate among philosophers of physics: see, for example, Smeenk\n(2006), Lyre (2008), Struyve (2011), Friederich (2013).\nFor a historical-philosophical analysis, see also Borrelli (2012). A\ndetailed discussion of the foundational and interpretational issues\nraised by the Higgs mechanism is provided in Berghofer,\nFran\u00e7ois, Friederich, Gomes, Hetzroni, Maas, and Sondenheimer\n(2023, 3.3).\n\nDynamical symmetry breaking (DSB). In such theories as the\nunified model of electroweak interactions, the SSB responsible (via\nthe Higgs mechanism) for the masses of the gauge vector bosons is\nbecause of the symmetry-violating vacuum expectation values of scalar\nfields (the so-called Higgs fields) introduced ad hoc in the\ntheory. For different reasons \u2014 first of all, the initially\nad hoc character of these scalar fields for which there was\nno experimental evidence until the results obtained in July 2012 at\nthe LHC \u2014 some attention has been drawn to the possibility that\nthe Higgs fields could be phenomenological rather than fundamental,\nthat is bound states resulting from a specified dynamical mechanism.\nSSB realized in this way has been called\n \u201cDSB\u201d.[18]\n\nSymmetry breaking raises a number of philosophical issues.\nSome of them relate only to the breaking of specific types of\nsymmetries, such as the issue of the significance of parity violation\nfor the problem of the nature of space (see\n Section 2.4,\n above). Others, for example the connection between symmetry breaking\nand observability, are particular aspects of the general issue\nconcerning the status and significance of physical symmetries, but in\nthe case of SSB they take on a stronger force: what is the\nepistemological status of a theory based on \u201chidden\u201d\nsymmetries and SSB? Given that what we directly observe \u2014 the\nphysical situation, the phenomenon \u2014 is asymmetric, what is the\nevidence for the \u201cunderlying\u201d symmetry? On this point, see\nfor example Morrison (2003) and Kosso (2000). In the absence of direct\nempirical evidence, the above question then becomes whether and how\nfar the predictive and explanatory power of theories based on SSB\nprovides good reasons for believing in the existence of the hidden\nsymmetries. Finally, there are issues raised by the motivation for,\nand role of, SSB. See for example Earman (2003a), using the algebraic\nformulation of QFT to explain SSB; for further philosophical\ndiscussions on SBB in QFT in the algebraic approach, see Ruetsche\n(2011), Fraser (2012), and references therein. Landsman (2013)\ndiscusses the issue whether SBB in infinite quantum systems can be\nseen as an example of asymptotic emergence in physics. Roberts (2022,\n4.5.4) argues that SBB provides an example of spacetime symmetries\nthat fail to be dynamical symmetries, contra a famous\nprinciple of Earman (1989, 3.4). \n\nSSB allows symmetric theories to describe asymmetric reality. In\nshort, SSB provides a way of understanding the complexity of nature\nwithout renouncing fundamental symmetries. But why should we prefer\nsymmetric to asymmetric fundamental laws? In other words, why assume\nthat an observed asymmetry requires a cause, which can be an explicit\nbreaking of the symmetry of the laws, asymmetric initial conditions,\nor SSB? Note that this assumption is very similar to the one expressed\nby Curie in his famous 1894 paper. Curie\u2019s principle (the\nsymmetries of the causes must be found in the effects; or,\nequivalently, the asymmetries of the effects must be found in the\ncauses), when extended to include the case of SSB, is equivalent to a\nmethodological principle according to which an asymmetry of the\nphenomena must come from the breaking (explicit or spontaneous) of the\nsymmetry of the fundamental laws. What the real nature of this\nprinciple is remains an open issue, at the centre of a developing\ndebate (see\n Section 3,\n above).\n\nFinally, let us mention the argument that is sometimes made in the\nliterature that SSB implies that Curie\u2019s principle is violated\nbecause a symmetry is broken \u201cspontaneously\u201d, that is\nwithout the presence of any asymmetric cause. Now it is true that SSB\nindicates a situation where solutions exist that are not invariant\nunder the symmetry of the law (dynamical equation) without any\nexplicit breaking of this symmetry. But, as we have seen, the symmetry\nof the \u201ccause\u201d is not lost, it is conserved in the\nensemble of the solutions (the whole\n \u201ceffect\u201d).[19]\n",
