    "main_text": "Theory of Knowledge\n2. Theory of Knowledge\n\nAs already noted, this heading comes under \u2018logic\u2019 in\nSextus Empiricus. No one reports anything for Xenocrates about what we\nwould think of as pure logic; Sextus (Adversus mathematicos\nvii 147\u2013149) gives us a scrap about epistemology. Xenocrates is\nsupposed to have divided the substances or entities into three groups:\nperceptible, intelligible, and believable (also referred to as\n\u2018composite\u2019 and \u2018mixed\u2019). The intelligible\nones were objects of knowledge, which Xenocrates apparently spoke of\nas \u2018epistemonic logos\u2019 or \u2018knowing account\u2019,\nand were \u2018located\u2019 outside the heavens. The perceptible\nones were objects of perception, which was capable of attaining truth\nabout them but nothing that counted as knowledge; they were within the\nheavens. The composite ones were the heavenly objects themselves, and\nobjects of belief, which is sometimes true and sometimes false.\n\nThis scheme descends from that in Plato, Republic V ad\nfin., where the objects of knowledge were differentiated from\nthose of belief, and from Republic VI ad fin., where\nthat division is portrayed on a divided line. In the latter passage,\nPlato seems actually to have four divisions of types of cognition and\ntheir objects, but this is notoriously difficult (see Burnyeat 1987),\nand Xenocrates appears to have rethought it. His tripartite division\nof objects looks like that in Aristotle, Metaphysics XII\n1.\n\nThe phrase \u2018epistemonic logos\u2019 is one Sextus (145) also\nassigns to Speusippus; it also recalls discussions in Aristotle (e.g.\nMetaphysics VII 15) and the end of Plato\u2019s\nTheaetetus. An \u2018epistemonic logos\u2019 is the sort of\naccount that carries knowledge with it.\n\nThe intelligible domain must have included the formal numbers dealt\nwith above, which was also, as mentioned, the domain of mathematics,\nwhile the special place for the heavens accords with the fact that one\nof the items in D.L.\u2019s bibliography is \u201cOn Astronomy, 6\nbooks\u201d.\n\nThis picture seems to square with Aristotle\u2019s exempting Xenocrates\nfrom the charge, leveled against Speusippus, of producing a\ndiscontinuous universe, and with Theophrastus\u2019 comment to the effect\nthat Xenocrates\u2019 universe encompassed everything.\n\nHere again we encounter Xenocrates the theologian: Sextus tells us\n(149) that Xenocrates associated the three fates with his three groups\nof substances: Atropos with the intelligible ones, Clotho with the\nperceptible ones, and Lachesis with the believable ones. This sounds a\nXenocratean touch: it connects with the interpretation of Plato (see\nRepublic X 620d\u2013e) and takes mythology very\nseriously.\n",
