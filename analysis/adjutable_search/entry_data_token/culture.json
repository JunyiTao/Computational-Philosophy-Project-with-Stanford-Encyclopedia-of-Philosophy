Democratic states are\nadditionally characterized by a commitment to treat all citizens\nequally, and so they require fair and just ways to wade through and\nrespond to these claims. This entry considers cultural claims in\nparticular.\n\nCultural claims are ubiquitous in political and legal spaces. Not only\ndo individuals and groups both make cultural claims against the state,\noften for legal or political accommodations, but the state often\nexplains its choices in terms of protecting particular aspects of its\nculture. This entry will first examine the ways in which\n\u201cculture\u201d is defined by political and moral philosophers:\nculture-as-encompassing group, culture-as-social-formation,\nculture-as-narrative/dialogue, and culture-as-identity. Over the\ncourse of this discussion, the \u201cessentialist\u201d challenge\nwill be introduced: an essentialist account of culture is one that\ntreats certain key characteristics of that culture as defining it and\ncorrespondingly all of its members must share certain key traits in\norder to be treated as members (for more, see Phillips 2010). In\nparticular, the entry goes on to note that early conceptions of\nculture-as-encompassing groups are criticized for being essentialist,\nand later conceptions are attempts to reformulate culture in ways that\navoid the essentialist challenge.\n\nFollowing an articulation of these main ways of understanding culture,\nthe entry turns to an assessment of distinct (though occasionally\noverlapping) types of cultural claims that are pressed against the\nstate by minority groups: exemption claims, assistance claims,\nself-determination claims, recognition claims, preservation claims\n(and claims against coerced cultural loss), defensive claims in legal\nsettings, and exclusive use claims (claims against cultural\nappropriation). There are both justifications for, and objections to,\nthese claims, and they often hinge on how \u201cculture\u201d is\nunderstood. In many cases, the disputes about the justifiability of\nthese claims hinge on competing understandings of what culture is, and\nespecially, how valuable it is to those who are members, as will be\nshown below. Finally, the entry will close with an assessment of cases\nwhere a majority community makes cultural claims to justify actions,\nmainly in the context of controlling immigration and, in some cases,\nrefusing entry to potential migrants all together, as well as the\ncultural demands it makes of those who are admitted, and the range of\njustifications and objections offered in these cases. This section\nconsiders the content of the majority culture, to which\nnewcomers are asked to adhere, as well as how forcibly they can be\n\u201casked\u201d to do so.\n", "toc": [{"#DefiCult": "1.

Defining Culture\n\nDefining the term \u201cculture\u201d is very challenging: it has\nbeen described as both a \u201cnotoriously overbroad concept\u201d\n(Song 2009: 177) and a \u201cnotoriously ambiguous concept\u201d\n(Eisenberg 2009: 7). It is deployed in multiple ways: as the entry\nwill go on to consider in more length, the term \u201cculture\u201d\ncan refer to the set of norms, practices and values that characterize\nminority and majority groups, for example by noting that the Hasidic\nJewish communities in New York practice a unique\n\u201cculture\u201d, or by describing Italian or Senegalese culture.\nBut it is also used in other ways, for example, to refer to\n\u201cbro\u201d culture or \u201chipster\u201d culture, or the\nculture of British football fans. Moreover, any one person can be a\nmember of multiple cultures\u2014someone (like this writer!) can be a\nmember of the Canadian culture, the Ottawan culture, the Jewish\nculture, and the academic culture at the same time. Contextual\nconsiderations will explain why the norms, practices, and values that\ndefine each of these cultures become relevant at a particular moment.\nMoreover, only some of these cultures have political and legal\nrelevance; only those that do are the focus of this entry.\n\nIn the political and legal spheres, there is widespread disagreement\nabout what culture is, and the next section is focused on\nelaborating these distinct views of culture. There is however\nconsiderable agreement that whatever it is, it matters to\npeople and the meaning and value it provides to the lives of\nindividuals are among the most important reasons, if not the most\nimportant ones, to defend and protect it in legal and political\nspaces. This value is why it is important to attempt to\ndiscover what culture is and correspondingly why, and which aspects of\nit in particular, should or should not be protected in the public\nsphere. Notice that the observation that cultures are valuable to\npeople, and indeed that they bring value to the lives of individuals,\nis not the same as saying that individual cultural practices are all\ngood. Any defensible account of culture must take seriously the\nimportance of culture in general without defending all of its\ninstantiations. There are four main ways in which culture has been\ninterpreted: as an encompassing group, as social formation, in\ndialogic terms, and in identity terms.\n1.1 Culture-as-encompassing-group\n\nOne way to think about culture is as a kind of all-encompassing whole,\nwhich shapes all or most dimensions of our lives. It is perhaps Will\nKymlicka\u2019s formulation of a \u201csocietal culture\u201d that\nis most responsible for generating serious reflection on the nature of\nculture understood in this way. A societal culture\n\n\nprovides its members with meaningful ways of life across the full\nrange of human activities, including social, educational, religious,\nrecreational and economic life, encompassing both public and private\nspheres. (Kymlicka 1996: 76)\n\n\nKymlicka explains that a vibrant societal culture provides a\n\u201ccontext for choice\u201d, i.e., it provides the resources that\nindividuals rely on to make sense of their world and the choices it\noffers. On this account, nation-states are well-described as having a\nsocietal culture, as are Indigenous groups and sub-state national\nminority groups (for example, the Catalans or the Tibetans); immigrant\ngroups which sustain a range of cultural practices and norms even as\nthey integrate into a larger \u201csocietal culture\u201d are\nnot.\n\nKymlicka is not alone in offering an encompassing account of culture.\nMichael Walzer too offers such an account, proposing that we\nunderstand political communities as \u201ccommunities of\ncharacter\u201d, in which members are bound by a \u201cworld of\ncommon meanings\u201d (Walzer 1983: 28). Avishai Margalit and Joseph\nRaz also describe so-called \u201cencompassing\u201d groups, in\nwhich their members\n\n\nfind in them a culture which shapes to a large degree their tastes and\nopportunities, and which provides an anchor for their\nself-identification and the safety of effortless secure belonging.\n(Margalit & Raz 1990: 448)\n\n\nAvishai Margalit and Moshe Halbertal say of an encompassing group that\nits culture \u201ccovers various important aspects of life\u201d,\nand in so saying, they offer as an example the Ultra-Orthodox Jewish\nculture:\n\n\nit defines people\u2019s activities (such as Torah study in\nUltra-Orthodox culture), determines occupation (such as circumciser),\nand defines important relationships (such as marriage). It affects\neverything people do: cooking, architectural style, common language,\nliterary and artistic traditions, music, customs, dress, festivals,\nceremonies\u2026the culture influences its members\u2019 taste, the\ntypes of options they have and the meaning of these options, and the\ncharacteristics they consider significant in their evaluation of\nthemselves and others.\u00a0(Margalit & Halbertal 1994: 498)\n\n\nWhereas Kymlicka emphasizes the freedom that is offered by a\nrobust societal culture, Margalit and Halbertal speak of its role in\nsecuring\u00a0members\u2019 \u201cpersonality identity\u201d\n(Margalit & Halbertal 1994: 502) and Walzer of its importance in\nshaping a \u201ccollective consciousness\u201d. Although these\nscholars justify the protection of a robust culture for many reasons,\nthey agree that what culture does, fundamentally, is offer a\nbackground value system that helps members select among options and\ninterpret their value, including for example with respect to certain\nforms of employment, or education, or family structure and\nchild-rearing. Walzer captures the way in which culture informs how\neven the most basic of things are understood:\n\n\na single necessary good, and one that is always necessary\u2014food,\nfor example\u2014carries different meanings in different places.\nBread is the staff of life, the body of Christ, the symbol of the\nSabbath, the means of hospitality, and so on. (Walzer 1983: 8)\n\n\nMuch is illuminated by these accounts of culture, including especially\nwhy depleted societal cultures may be less able to provide the context\nfor choice that Kymlicka emphasizes, or why one\u2019s\n\u201cpersonality identity\u201d may thereby be threatened: if a\ncultural group\u2019s educational, political, or economic systems are\nweakened, their capacity to support members to make sense of the\nworld, and choose among options, is likewise weakened. Moreover, this\naccount illustrates the wrong of undermining the cultures of others:\nif a culture is undermined, the choices available to its members are\nthereby reduced. We can see this with respect to Indigenous culture in\nmany states: where states have actively attempted to erase Indigenous\nculture, the result has been severe social dislocation and alienation\namong Indigenous peoples whose context for choice has been\nsubstantially weakened.\n\nHowever, multiple objections have been launched at this way of\nunderstanding culture, most of which are variants on what is termed\nthe \u201cessentialist\u201d objection; notice, though, that the\nviews described above are not believed by their holders to be\nessentialist. The essentialist objection targets what it sees as an\nassumption that members of a culture will hold the same set of\npractices, norms, and values to be important, and in the same measure.\nBut, say critics, this assumption does not hold: in any actual\nculture, members will be differently committed to its defining\npractices and norms, and indeed, there will necessarily be\ndisagreement around which of its practices and norms are defining in\nthe first place. The essentialist objection says, roughly, that\ntreating culture as encompassing wrongly does one of the following\nthings: 1) it proclaims that certain features of a culture are at its\ncore and therefore immutable, on pain of dissolving the culture\n(Eisenberg 2009: 120), and correspondingly that cultures are\nnecessarily bounded and determinate rather than contested and\nfluid (Moore 2019; Patten 2014: 38); 2) having identified these\nfeatures as at a culture\u2019s core, it excludes those who believe\nthemselves to be members but\u00a0do not\u00a0 conform to, display, or\nrespect\u00a0these features (Parvin 2008: 318\u201319); and, 3) it\nignores the reality that most people in a liberal society \u201cdraw\ntheir identity from a multiplicity of roles and communities and\nmemberships at any one time\u201d (Parvin 2008: 321), which can\nvariously have social salience, depending on the context, both\nindependently of, and sometimes in conjunction with, cultural\nidentities (Moore 2019). In summary, a too-encompassing account of\nwhat culture is for its members runs the risk of treating the\nboundaries of a culture as if they are determinate, unshifting, and as\nthough its members display no variance (and perhaps cannot display\nvariance) in their commitment to the culture as a whole and its\ndefining practices.\n\nThe alternative accounts of culture that are considered below are all,\nat least in part, intended to respond to the essentialist challenge;\ntheir objective is, in other words, to generate a plausible account of\nwhat culture is, and correspondingly what it means to be a\nmember of a particular cultural group, that can be deployed to make\nsense of legal and political controversies, and ideally adjudicate\namong them, without succumbing to the essentialist challenge. A\ncaveat: the views of culture treated below should be understood as\n\u201cideal types\u201d, characterized so as to understand its key\nfeatures, how it is differentiated from other views, and why it does\nnot fall victim (in its own estimation) to the essentialist\nchallenge.\n1.2 Culture-as-social-formation\n\nOne attempt to reconceive culture in a way that responds to the\nessentialist challenge, but which retains a view of culture as largely\nencompassing, proposes that cultures are defined by their\nmembers\u2019 shared experience of social formation (Patten\n2014: 39). On this \u201csocial lineage\u201d account of culture,\nwhat makes a culture is that its members are subject to a\n\u201cset of formative conditions that are distinct from the\nformative conditions that are imposed on others\u201d (Patten 2014:\n51). The experience of being subjected to common institutions,\nunderstood broadly to include shared educational spaces, languages,\nmedia, as well as shared historical traditions and stories,\noverlapping familial structures, and so on, shapes a sense among\ncultural group members that they share a distinct way of seeing the\nworld, and that certain assumptions that they possess are shared by,\nor at least understood by, others. This view emphasizes a\nculture\u2019s historical trajectory, but does not require that its\ndefining norms, values and practices are unchanging over time. On the\ncontrary,\n\n\ninternal variation is possible because subjection to a common set of\nformative influences does not imply that people will end up with a\nhomogeneous set of beliefs or values. (Patten 2014: 52)\n\n\nAs a result, cultures are sites in which members can contest and\ndeliberate their meaning with enough shared assumptions about\nthe way the world works that they can recognize each other as engaged\nin the same project.\n\nPatten writes of the institutions to which cultural group members are\nsubject that they are at least to some degree \u201cisolated from the\ninstitutions and practices that work to socialize outsiders\u201d\n(Patten 2014: 52), and thus serve to distinguish one culture from\nanother. On this view, significant emphasis is placed on who is\ncontrolling the levers of the institutions that shape members\u2019\nformation: that is, it matters that members are in control of\nthe institutions to which they, themselves,\u00a0are subject, so that\nthey can plausibly shape their own social experience, and the\nexperience of younger members, in fundamental ways. Where the control\nover this social formation is denied, a culture\u2019s members are\nthereby harmed; when it is coercively denied, there is very likely an\ninjustice demanding remedy.\n\nBy focusing on the shared experience of subjection to common cultural\ninstitutions, this account avoids the accusation that what defines a\nculture is the stability of its basic norms and values over time:\nculture is not, on this view, a static entity. Instead, what matters\nis that cultural group members believe themselves to be members of a\ncultural group, and that this belief\u2019s foundation is\u00a0in the\nexperience of common cultural institutions, rather than in the\nspecific practices that are central to the group. These central\npractices can change fundamentally, without the cultural group itself\ndissolving. However, this view is subject to criticism by scholars who\nworry that those who control the levers of formation do not represent\nthe views of all members (Phillips 2018), that instead they are using\ntheir relative positions of power to create and enforce cultural norms\nand practices that do not command (or would not command, without\ncoercion) widespread agreement.\n1.3 Culture-as-dialogue\n\nThe latter objection\u2014that a so-called culture is the product of\nsome but not all of its members leads some scholars to rearticulate\nculture in terms of the ways in which it is constructed via dialogue\namong members and their engagement with each other. The purpose of\nemphasizing that a culture\u2019s members are the source of its main\npractices, values and norms, is to emphasize that a culture is not\n\u201cgiven\u201d to its members from above, as a fixed and\nunalterable entity. Rather, members of a culture are, in a fundamental\nway, its authors. Here is James Tully explaining this: cultures\nare\n\n\ncontinuously contested, imagined and reimagined, transformed and\nnegotiated, both by their members and through their interactions with\nothers. (Tully 1995: 11)\n\n\nSeyla Benhabib similarly emphasizes the narrative aspect of\ncultures, noting that insiders\n\n\nexperience their traditions, stories, rituals and symbols, tools, and\nmaterial living conditions through shared, albeit contested and\ncontestable, narrative accounts. (Benhabib 2002: 5)\n\n\nThat there is contestation among members, and that its main elements\nare under constant negotiation, does not render a culture any less\nmeaningful for its members. What may seem confusing is the idea that a\ncontestable and constantly shifting culture warrants protection;\nperhaps protection means artificially halting the natural changes that\na culture would undergo, by protecting elements of it at a moment in\ntime. But defenders of this view demand protection in the form of\nensuring that the forums in which culture is negotiated, shared and\ntransmitted, are sustained in robust and inclusive ways, and without\nunwanted interference by forces external to the culture. As with the\nculture-as-formation account, the emphasis is on the capacity of group\nmembers to shape the norms and practices that are central, rather than\nwith the norms and practices themselves.\n\nHow does this view respond to the worry about asymmetrical power\ndistribution within a cultural group? Focusing on the ways in which a\nculture\u2019s central characteristics are determined via negotiation\namong members is an attempt to be attentive to the power structures\nthat shape whose voice is heard during these negotiations, in\nminority and majority cultures (Dhamoon 2006). In many, and indeed\nperhaps in most, cultures, historically the dominant voices have been\nmale, and one impact of that has generally been a gendered view of the\nhow best to organize cultural life,\u00a0that has reduced the rights\nof women (and other minorities) in myriad ways, often to their\ndisadvantage as well as against their will. For some, the oppression\nof less powerful members by those who hold the levers of power\ngenerates at least partial skepticism about the value of protecting or\naccommodating culture in liberal, democratic states, especially in\ncases where it may seem that \u201cmulticulturalism is bad for\nwomen\u201d (Okin 1999). On this view, cultural practices that\nundermine the rights of women (and other minorities) should not be\ntolerated in liberal democratic states.\n\nThe recognition that many cultural practices are disadvantageous to\nwomen (and other minorities) does not propel all political theorists\nto adopt a skeptical attitude towards them in all cases. For some, it\nis an opportunity to see that cultures can be valued even by those who\nare putatively oppressed, even as they work from the inside to\ninfluence the direction of their culture, towards less oppressive\nnorms and practices. For example, although often sidelined from their\ncentres of power, many women value their cultures in ways that press\nthem not to exit, but rather to engage in processes of reforming\ninegalitarian practices and norms, from within (Deveaux 2007). This\nway of thinking about culture and its contents celebrates, and\nencourages, moves to \u201cdemocratize\u201d the mechanisms by which\na cultural group\u2019s main norms, values and practices are adopted,\nand defends public cultures that are genuinely open to multiple voices\n(Lenard 2012).\n\nThis narrative or dialogic account of culture thus responds well to\nthe essentialist challenge, by denying that the defining features of a\nculture must be static and equally valuable to\u00a0all members of a\ncultural group. But, it must respond to another challenge, namely, the\nindividuation challenge (Moore 2019). If an account of culture is\ngoing to be robust enough to define the entities that should be\nentitled to additional political and legal consideration in various\nways, including with respect to additional rights protections or\nexemptions from certain legal and political requirements, it must also\nbe able to identify with some specificity the boundaries of a\nparticular, discrete, culture and who legitimately counts as a member\nfor the purposes of respecting the political and legal claims made as\na result. But this can be a challenge to accomplish.\n\nTo see why, consider Benhabib\u2019s account of the ways in which\ncultures are observed from the outside, and the way they are\nexperienced from the inside. The observer is largely\nresponsible, she says, for imposing \u201cunity and coherence on\ncultures\u201d, whereas from the inside, its participants\n\n\nexperience their traditions, stories, rituals and symbols, tools, and\nmaterial living conditions through shared, albeit contested and\ncontestable, narrative accounts. (Benhabib 2002: 5)\n\n\nOne effect of understanding the culture in this way is that while many\nof its members will hold deeply to the central values and take deep\nsatisfaction in participating in the central cultural traditions, many\nothers will dip in and out of its central practices, and pick and\nchoose among its central values and norms. So, just who\ncounts as a member is blurry, and this blurriness\u00a0may appear to\nbe a\u00a0problem when membership is said to confer rights and\nprivileges that are not available to non-members. There is an\ninevitable tension between the need to individuate cultures for\npolitical reasons and the boundaries of cultures which are inevitably\npoorly demarcated. Only context will enable us to resolve the\npolitical questions that will thereby emerge.\n1.4 Culture-as-identity (or identity rather than culture)\n\nTo answer the challenge of how to identify a culture, and its members,\none proposal focuses on the subjective component associated with\nbelonging to a cultural group. Take this example, described by\nMargaret Moore: although there is deep division in Northern Ireland\nbetween Catholics and Protestants, the differences are neither\nreligious (the conflict is not about distinctive interpretations of a\nreligious text, and religious figures are not targeted for violence),\nnor cultural, since surveys of cultural values of both communities\nreveal considerable overlap among the values that competing\ncommunities hold (Moore 1999: 35). She says, rather, a focus on shared\nidentities among rival groups makes more sense of the conflict.\u00a0\nA largely or partly identity-focused view highlights that one key\ndimension of culture is the way in which it shapes the identity of\ncultural group members. As well, such a view highlights that culture\nis a thing to which many people will have important\nconnections,\u00a0but\u00a0which will be defining for them in multiple\nand distinct\u00a0ways. An identity-focused view has clear merits: for\nexample, it can explain why individuals remain nominally attached to a\nculture, even though its centrally defining features shift\nhistorically over time, and even if they do not engage with some of\nits more traditional aspects.\n\nAdditionally, an identity-focused view can accommodate identities that\nare not obviously culturally based, for example, including LGBTQ+\nidentities (Eisenberg 2009: 20; for a discussion of cultural/identity\nclaims in an LGBTQ+ context, see Ghosh 2018: chapter 4). Indeed, an\nidentity-focused view aims to circumvent the difficulty of identifying\nwhat specific material is legitimately cultural material. As noted\nabove, scholars of minority cultures\u00a0frequently note that there\nis a wide variety of claims made by a wide variety of groups, and\nthese groups are defined by an assortment of distinct characteristics,\nincluding race, ethnicity, religion and sexuality. Say its defenders,\na focus on identity rather than culture may be preferable because\n\n\nthe term identity covers more ground in the sense that it can refer to\nreligious, linguistic, gendered, Indigenous and other dimensions of\nself-understanding. (Eisenberg 2009: 2)\n\n2. Minority Cultural Rights Claims\n\nThe four views of culture described above inform the cultural claims\nthat both individuals and groups make against the state. The specific\nthreats that individuals and groups face, and which demand a kind of\nprotection, are distinct, as are the responses that states may have in\nresponse to the claims made by individuals and groups (Eisenberg 2009:\n20\u201321). In some cases, claims are made for accommodations for\nall members of a group qua group; in others, claims are made with\nrespect to particular individuals; and there may well be connection\namong these. For example, a group may demand language protection\npolicies, or an individual may claim a right to speak her mother\ntongue in legal proceedings. These rights are related to each other,\nand may be in some cases derived from one another: one\u00a0reason an\nindividual has a right to speak her mother tongue in legal proceedings\nmay be because the state has recognized her language as an official\nlanguage either of the state, or of a sub-state jurisdiction, for\nexample. As a matter of accommodation, it will be important\nin what follows to notice when claims are made for accommodations that\napply to individuals and when they are accommodations that apply to\ngroups; although some philosophers are keen to assess whether cultural\nrights are best understood as individual or group rights (Casals\n2006), the analysis below proceeds by assuming that they can be both\n(following Levy 2000: 125).\n\nNotice as well that the term \u201caccommodation\u201d is a kind of\ncatch-all to include the wide range of claims an individual or group\ncan make against a state on the basis of culture. Political\nphilosophers have attempted to distinguish among these claims in\nmyriad ways, in order to make sense of them. Many such rights are\nclaimed by immigrant groups (typically) to a state, who require\ncertain accommodations from the state in order to better integrate\ninto that state. In the larger debate around the value of\nmulticulturalism, there is considerable discussion about which sorts\nof accommodations encourage the integration of, especially, culturally\ndistinct newcomers, and which sorts permit or even encourage their\nseparation from the larger society (e.g., Sniderman & Hagendoorn\n2007). Some scholars worry, as well, that a focus on how best to\naccommodate cultural minority groups travels with ignoring (perhaps\nwilfully) more important questions of redistribution to those who are\nless well off (Barry 2001; Fraser 1995). In general, however,\nmulticultural theorists agree that accommodation rights are most\ndefensible when they support the integration of minorities in general,\nand newcomers in particular, as well as when they are aimed at\nremedying persistent\u00a0inequalities between majority and minority\ngroups.\n\nIt is worth noting that not everyone readily agrees that\n\u201cculture\u201d should be treated as a source of distinct legal\nand political claims, however. For example, Sarah Song points\nout\u00a0that so-called \u201cmulticultural\u201d claims are often\nin fact claims to accommodate a wide range of groups, including\nracial, religious and ethnic groups. Many political theorists of\ncultural rights appear to believe that\u00a0there are distinct and\nrecognizable cultural groups, making distinctive cultural claims,\nwhereas in their example-giving they rely on a \u201cwide range of\nexamples involving religion, language, ethnicity, nationality, and\nrace\u201d (Song 2009: 177). Rarely is \u201cculture\u201d alone\nthe basis for a claim against a state. Rather, says Song, so-called\ncultural claims are in fact often demands\u00a0for other\nwell-understood and defensible democratic goods. Most such\ndemands\u00a0are for religious accommodations, well-defended by\nstandard liberal defenses of freedom of conscience; others are demands\nfor reparations for past and ongoing wrong, in the form of affirmative\naction; others yet are demands\u00a0for democratic inclusion, often\nrooted in a morally problematic history of deliberate exclusion. Once\nthe reasons for these \u201ccultural\u201d demands are revealed\nclearly, we will often find democratically defensible reasons to\nrespect and accommodate them, without needing to resort to relying on\nculture as a distinct entity, giving rise to a distinct set of\nrights-claims.\u00a0The result is that the controversy associated with\nproperly defining cultures and identifying their members can be\navoided in many instances. However, this analysis can make it\ndifficult to treat cases where something called \u201cculture\u201d\ninteracts with, or supplements, religious, ethnic, and racial\nclaims.\n\nTake the case of the choice, made by referendum, to ban minarets on\nmosques in Switzerland. The defensibility of the ban has been the\nsubject of deliberation among political philosophers, and one key\npoint of contention has been whether and to what extent minarets are\nreligiously required by Islam. Many interpreters propose\nthat, since minarets are not obligatory according to Islamic religious\nrequirements, the choice to ban them is regrettable (because of what\nit says about the public place of Islam in Switzerland), but it does\nnot violate the religious freedom of practising Muslims in\nSwitzerland, and as a result is permissible (Miller 2016). In making\nthis claim, however, what is ignored is the cultural\nsignificance of minarets. Without a recognition of the distinct place\nof culture in certain claims, a full understanding of the minaret case\ncannot be reached. The same challenge can be seen in deliberations\naround whether Muslim women should be permitted to wear face coverings\nin public spaces. Some commentators suggest that, because (according\nto some interpretations) Islamic texts do not appear to\nrequire face coverings, women can be denied the right to\nengage in this practice, without violating their religious freedom. In\nmaking this argument, its defenders notice that the choice to cover\nfaces is in effect a (mere) cultural interpretation of\nIslamic requirements, as evidenced by the fact that only some\ncommunities of practising Muslims engage in the practice. For some\nscholars, it is essential to separate religious from cultural\nclaims\u2014liberal democratic states take religious claims\nvery seriously as matters of conscience, and have a long\nhistory of zealously protecting religious freedom. So, having\ndetermined that a claim is not one of religious freedom, such\nscholars believe they can\u00a0comfortably deny the request for\npermission to cover faces in public spaces. However, ignoring the\ncultural dimensions of the claim\u2014or treating them as though they\nare obviously of less significance than the underlying religious\nclaim\u2014fails to treat the case properly. In particular,\nit\u00a0fails to take seriously that religious obligations necessarily\nhave cultural interpretations, that a full recognition of religious\nfreedom entails recognizing their cultural interpretations,\nand that specifically cultural legal and political accommodation (of a\nreligious commitment)\u00a0will thereby be called for.\n\nIn what follows, distinct types of cultural claims, made against a\nstate\u2019s major institutions, will be examined. These claims are,\nas will be seen, sometimes made by individuals and sometimes by\ngroups. Where relevant, the analysis will highlight whether the\nconcept of culture that is being deployed is culture-as-encompassing\ngroup, culture-as-social-formation, culture-as-narrative, or\nculture-as-identity. The analysis will not always be neat. In some\ncases, there will be multiple defenses of a cultural right, which rely\non distinct understandings of culture.\n2.1 Exemption rights\n\nPerhaps the most familiar type of cultural claim made against the\nstate is in the form of request for exemptions from rules and\nregulations that typically apply to all citizens. Exemption rights\nrespond to the fact that, in liberal democracies, laws and practices\nare meant\u2014genuinely\u2014to treat all citizens equally, but\nthat there are some which inadvertently impose disadvantage on certain\nminorities. The worry to be resolved is that minority citizens are\nunintentionally or accidentally burdened by the normal application of\ncertain laws (Levy 2000: 130), in ways that treat them unfairly, which\ncan be resolved by exemptions from certain laws and normal practices\n(Quong 2006; Gutmann 2003). The extension of exemption rights then is\nunderstood as a\n\n\na recognition of that difference, as an attempt not to unduly burden\nthe minority culture or religion en route to the laws\u2019\nlegitimate goals. (Levy 2000: 130)\n\n\nFor example, some Sikhs request exemption from\u00a0laws that require\nwearing motorcycle or construction-site helmets. Although Sikhism is a\nreligion, Sikhs describe the requirement that they wear a turban not\nquite as a religious requirement, but rather as a symbol of their\nfaith and commitment to Sikh values, as well as an expression of their\nidentity (Sikh Faith FAQs in\n Other Internet Resources).\n Without exemption from these laws, Sikhs would be excluded from\ntaking advantage of opportunities that are meant to be available to\nall citizens on an equal basis. The same is true of Indigenous\ncommunities, who have requested exemptions from generally applicable\nlaws that limit hunting and fishing, explaining that such limits\nundermine their traditional way of life, or make\u00a0it hard (or\nimpossible) for them to sustain themselves (Levy 2000: 128). Before\nSunday-closing laws were abandoned in Canada and the United States,\nreligious minorities were occasionally granted exemptions from them.\nIn these cases, as described above and without legally provided\nexemptions, people (usually minorities) must choose between\nparticipating in opportunities that should be available to all\ncitizens on an equal basis or to respect their (cultural)\nunderstanding of what their religion requires of them.\n\nThe request for exemption can be\u00a0lightly distinguished from the\nrequest for rule modification. As indicated, exemption requests are,\nas they sound, requests that individuals be exempted from certain\nrequirements that are meant to apply to all citizens equally;\nmodification requests ask for changes in existing, majority, practices\nto accommodate certain other, minority, practices. Sikhs sometimes\nrequest exemption from laws that would, otherwise, require them to\nremove their turban as above; in other cases, they request uniform\nmodifications, so that turbans are treated as one among several\navailable head coverings for those carrying out a specific\nrole.\u00a0The same is true of uniform modification requests made by\nMuslim women who cover their faces or heads, and Jewish men who wear\nyarmulkes, where uniforms have traditionally required an uncovered\nhead or face, or where they have required particular head coverings\n(as in the Sikh case, they may also be presented as requests for\nexemptions). Similarly, when observant Muslims request short breaks in\ntheir work day to pray at specific times of day, or when Jewish and\nMuslim students ask for changes in the provision of foods (to\naccommodate kosher and halal obligations) in school cafeterias, the\nrequest is for modification rather than exemption.\n\nIn most cases, the early failure of a legitimate law to modify or\nexempt new practices is unintentional. That is, the laws or practices\nin place were not adopted intentionally with the purpose of excluding,\nbut were rather adopted under the assumption that they treat the\nexisting population fairly. But widespread immigration has diversified\nmany populations in substantial ways. Immigrants often travel with\npractices and norms that are, when they arrive, unfamiliar to the\nstates they are joining, and as a result states are asked to modify\ncertain laws, and exempt newcomers from certain others. There may be\ncases where there are legitimate public reasons to persist in applying\ncertain laws in spite of the disadvantage they generate for newcomers.\nAs well, there are cases where states persist in demanding obedience\nto laws and practices that clearly disadvantage newcomers attempting\nto integrate, but where there are no good mitigating factors to\njustify persisting in the imposing of disadvantage (as when the Danish\ntown of Randers passed a law requiring that pork be served \u201con\nan equal footing with other foods\u201d in school cafeterias). In\nthese latter cases, the exclusionary impact of the laws is no longer\ninadvertent, and they are generally condemnable for perpetuating\nunnecessary and unjustified exclusion from political, economic and\nsocial spaces.\n\nIt is not always the case that individuals or groups claiming cultural\nrights to exemption and modification are immigrants, but that is often\nthe case. Indigenous communities ask for exemptions, as do certain\northodox religious communities. These cases will be discussed below in\nthe section focused on cultural preservation.\n2.2 Assistance rights\n\nDemands for assistance call on the state to preserve the conditions\nunder which various elements of a culture can persist and even thrive,\nespecially minority languages, or to promote and protect cultural\nassociations in various ways, including by offering financial support\nto artists from within these cultural groups, or by providing\nresources to permit the production and distribution of ethnic-language\nmedia. The justification for assistance rights is the same as for\nexemption and modification requests: it is to prevent persistent\nunfairness in access to rights or goods that are meant to be available\nfor all citizens on an equal basis. In the case of assistance rights,\ncultural minority groups argue\u00a0that the majority group has access\nto these goods already, for example to a robust language or media\nspace, and so they request\u00a0state resources to secure\nthese\u00a0goods for cultural minorities as well. Here, whereas the\njustification overlaps with the one offered to defend exemption and\nmodification\u00a0rights\u2014to generate fairness\u2014the\nunderstanding of culture that underpins the demand for these rights is\ndistinct. Typically, exemption and modification claims treat\nculture-as-identity or dialogue, whereas in the case of assistance\nclaims, the background understanding of culture is often\nculture-as-social-formation or culture-as-encompassing group; the\nculture is treated as a whole that requires assistance to protect each\nof its central parts, in order to do\u00a0the job of shaping members\nwell.\n2.3 Self-determination rights\n\nSelf-determination rights are those that confer substantial control to\nsub-state jurisdictions over a particular territory and in particular\nthe right to run the major institutions on that territory. A\nself-determining community is one that, because of control over major\ninstitutions in a territory, is capable of making and enforcing\ndecisions, without interference by outsiders, in multiple policy\nspaces (I. M. Young 2004). The justification for self-determination\nrights is sometimes based on reparation or corrective justice, for\nexample where past state actions have undermined the capacity for a\nparticular cultural group to be self-determining in the first place\n(Song 2009: 184). In other cases, the demand for self-determination is\njustified with respect to the importance of protecting the autonomy of\na culturally distinct sub-state jurisdiction, that is, its capacity to\nrun its own affairs in ways that are consonant with its particular\ncultural preferences. The right to self-determination typically relies\non an understanding of culture-as-encompassing group, or\nculture-as-social-formation, suggesting that without significant\ncontrol over the major institutions that govern the lives of citizens,\nthe relevant group will not be able to be self-determining.\n\nThe right to self-determination is typically attributed to states, so\nits meaning in the context of minority communities operating at the\nsub-state level is not always clear. Among sub-state jurisdictions,\nthe right is often claimed by Indigenous groups as well as sub-state\nnational groups, like the Basques and the Scottish, whose\n\u201csocietal culture\u201d is manifestly distinct from the\nmajority\u2019s societal culture. The demand for self-determination\nis\u00a0a demand to make choices about how children are educated, what\nlanguage is spoken by the relevant political authorities, and how the\npublic space should be organized. The right claimed has at least three\nmanifestations: 1) the right, at a minimum, to \u201cmaintain a\ncomprehensive way of life within the larger society without\ninterference\u201d; 2) the right to recognition by the majority for\nits way of life, and 3) the right to active backing by the majority to\naffirmatively support the relevant way of life so that \u201cthe\nculture can flourish\u201d (Margalit & Halbertal 1994: 498).\nThese three interpretations make distinct demands on the state,\nrunning from simple non-interference to active participation in\nsustaining the conditions for self-determination. As a result, the\nlarger state is sometimes tasked with assessing the extent to which it\nwants to direct its resources to supporting a particular request for\nself-determination, focused on whether associated claims to cultural\npreservation are warranted. These will be considered\u00a0below.\n2.4 Recognition rights\n\nThe\u00a0demand for formal recognition in legal and political\ndocuments often travels with the demand for self-determination, and is\ngrounded in a desire to have the majority mark its commitment to the\nfull and equal respect of a cultural minority group (Mcbride\n2009).\u00a0In the Canadian case, the Qu\u00e9b\u00e9cois have\nlong fought for recognition as a nation, with a \u201cdistinct\nsociety\u201d. Attempts to recognize Qu\u00e9bec\u2019s status in\nthe Canadian constitution have repeatedly failed, though a motion that\nread \u201cThat this House recognize that the Qu\u00e9b\u00e9cois\nform a nation within a united Canada\u201d was approved (with\nconsiderable controversy, however) by the House of Commons in 2006.\nThe demand for recognition in this case is a demand for respect as an\nequal, national, founding partner of the Canadian state.\n\nIn the case of Indigenous communities as well, the right to\nself-determination often includes not only the demand to exercise\nauthority over specific jurisdictions, but also for\u00a0recognition.\nThey seek recognition, for example, as original inhabitants of a\nparticular state, or as nations in their own right, or as having been\nthe victims of various crimes at the hands of colonizers, including\nthe violation of early treaties between them, as well as demands for\nstate support in sustaining and, in many cases, rebuilding communities\nthat were actively devastated by colonizing/settler governments. In\nCanada, and other colonizing states, for example, it has become common\nto read land acknowledgement statements in advance of events\n(including as part of the \u201cannouncements\u201d read at the\nbeginning of a school day), recognizing that events and proceedings\nare taking place on unceded Indigenous land.\nSimilarly,\u00a0Australian Indigenous communities\u00a0have long\nargued for official recognition in the Australian constitution. From\nthe perspective of\u00a0Australian Indigenous communities, the hope,\nand indeed the expectation, is that official recognition will give\nrise to additional rights and benefits, for example to greater voice\nand political access to members of the minority. The hope for\nadditional rights and benefits is present in some, but not all, cases\nof recognition claims (for example, it largely was not present in the\ncase of Qu\u00e9bec).\n\nRecognition comes in other forms beyond acknowledgement in legal and\npolitical documents, that are intended to confirm respect for minority\ngroups. In some states, the languages of minority groups can be\nofficially recognized as national languages. For example, the\nRomansh language in Switzerland is officially recognized as a\nnational language, even though its speakers make up less than 1% of\nthe country\u2019s total population. By contrast, Turkish laws that\nbanned the speaking of Kurdish in public spaces were\u00a0an attempt\nto deny recognition to a national minority (lifted finally in 1991).\nAs with demands for official recognition in binding constitutional\ndocuments, these sorts of recognition demonstrate respect for minority\ncommunities as well as a commitment to treating them as full and equal\nmembers of the larger state.\n2.5 Cultural preservation rights\n\nCultural preservation rights are those that groups claim as key to\nsustaining a cultural group as a cultural group. This right\nis sometimes described as a right to the \u201csurvival of a\nculturally-specific people\u201d (Gutmann 2003: 75). In\nsome\u00a0cases, the justification is\u00a0based on the claim that\ncertain forms of exposure to and engagement with the wider community\nwill result in the erosion of a culture that is valued by its members.\nIn others, the justification is historical, as in where orthodox\nreligious groups, fleeing religious persecution in Europe, agreed to\nsettle new land in Canada and the United States\u00a0in exchange for\nreligious freedom.\u00a0In others, the central justification is\nthat\u00a0cultural diversity is valuable and worth preserving, in and\nof itself\u00a0(Parekh 2000). (In some cases, cultural preservation\nrights are claimed as recompense for past wrong; this claim is\nconsidered separately, below.)\u00a0Demands for cultural preservation\nare most controversial where they are made by illiberal groups, as\nwill be detailed shortly.\n\nIt is worth dwelling here for a moment to notice that there are two\nways to interpret cultural preservation: it could mean the\npreservation of a group as a distinct cultural entity or it could mean\nthe preservation of certain practices and values that are believed, at\na moment in time, to be central to the culture. Rights to cultural\npreservation come in multiple formats, including demands for\nexemption, parental autonomy, respect for internal conflict resolution\nmechanisms (in family law, mainly), and control over membership. These\nrights are justified with respect to preserving culture,\nand\u00a0typically rely on an understanding of culture-as-encompassing\ngroups or culture-as-social-formation, just as does the more general\nright to self-determination with which they often travel.\n\nMany minority illiberal groups ask only for rights of forbearance\nagainst the state in which they live (Spinner-Halev 2000). In\nresponse, a state may permit an illiberal cultural group to be\n\u201cleft alone\u201d, on the idea that so long as it can persist\nwithout state support of any kind, it may do so. A state may be asked\nto do more, however, to preserve the culture.\n\nFor example, a\u00a0state may be asked\u00a0to exempt community\nmembers from certain requirements that are typically demanded of all\ncitizens, including mandatory schooling and child labour laws.\nConsider this example: many orthodox Amish communities live a life\nthat is largely segregated from the wider community. They live a\nreligiously structured way of life which dictates whom members marry,\nhow they raise children, how they produce an economy that permits\ntheir way of life to continue. In most cases, they demand neither\nrecognition nor additional financial support in order to protect their\ncommunities\u2019 way of life. They had previously demanded only\nnon-interference, for the most part. But, in the 1970s, some American\nAmish communities demanded, and were granted, the right to withdraw\ntheir children from mandatory education at the age of 14, arguing that\nwhere their children were required to remain in school until the age\nof 16, they were more likely to exit the community. This high rate of\nexit would, they argued, result in the failure of the Amish way of\nlife to persist over time (Burtt 1994). The right of exemption the\nAmish claimed was, in this case, derivative of the larger demand for\ncultural self-preservation; without the exemption, they said, the\nculture itself might fade\u00a0away.\n\nA state may also be asked to respect certain domains of legal\nauthority, perhaps most frequently in the domain of family law.\nMinority communities often regulate the conditions of marriage, and\ncustody of children, as well as divorce, and request the legal\nauthority to do so. Respecting the legal authority of minority\ncommunities to exercise jurisdiction in family law is the kind of\nrequest that often troubles critics of cultural minority rights, since\nit may entrench disadvantages to women, for example in divorce\nsettlements or custody agreements (Shachar 2001; Bakht 2007). In\ngeneral, then, states that acknowledge the legal authority of minority\ncommunities in the space of family law also demand that those\nwho are participating in these adjudication proceedings do so\nwillingly; majority states therefore often retain permission for\nthemselves to interefere in these proceedings,\u00a0in support of\nthose who may be\u00a0inadequately protected. The state must attempt a\nbalance here, between offering its support to the most vulnerable\nmembers of a minority group (for example to ensure that their\nconstitutional rights are protected) and interference of a kind that\nis inattentive to the rightful claims of minority groups to persist\nover time, in part by exercising its authority in key spaces.\n\nAnother common form\u00a0of cultural preservation rights are\nexclusion rights, that is, the right of a cultural group to\nrefuse to admit others to territory or membership, because of a worry\nthat more generous terms of admission threatens to undermine it by, in\neffect, diluting it. Just as states have the putative right to control\ntheir borders (discussed below in section 3), and who can claim\nmembership rights even after admission, so do some sub-state\njurisdictions claim this double right of exclusion, citing the\nimportance of cultural preservation. Indigenous communities have\nsometimes claimed the right to exclude non-Indigenous individuals from\nsettling on their territories or the right to exclude others (for\nexample non-Indigenous spouses of Indigenous persons) from certain\nmembership benefits, including the right to vote (or otherwise have a\nsay) for those who will govern. State courts have been asked to\nadjudicate the rightful authority of Indigenous\u00a0communities to\nmake these determinations (see Song 2005).\n\nThe cultural preservation rights described above pose a difficult\nchallenge, connected to the critiques of treating culture as an\nencompassing group: any claim for cultural preservation, say some\ncritics, translates in effect into problematic claims of control over\nmembers, which, moreover, are typically most restrictive for women and\nLGBTQ+ members of a cultural group. This is a challenge posed most\nforcefully where rights of cultural preservation are demanded by\nso-called illiberal groups like the Amish, and where they are (in the\neyes of critics) imposed on children against their will. Illiberal\ngroups are those which deny certain key liberal values, like autonomy\nand equality; in many cases, these communities are supported by\neducational systems that discourage autonomous choice-making, by\navoiding the teaching of skills and capacities that typically enable\nit, and by enforcing hierarchical rules that elevate some members over\nothers in ways that egalitarians find uncomfortable. The worry is that\nthe community wants not only to preserve itself as a distinct cultural\ngroup, but also\u00a0that it wants to protect a kind of cultural\nhomogeneity that leaves no room for contestation or dissent over its\ncentral values and practices. These latter hierarchical rules often\nrender women vulnerable to more powerful men, who may demand various\nforms of sexual subservience to them, who relegate them to the home to\ncare for children, and who impose rigid codes of behaviour on them,\nfor which harsh penalties are meted out in cases of violation. These\nkinds of so-called \u201ccultural practices\u201d are, for some\ncritics, such that they render any form of state support in protecting\nminority cultural groups largely indefensible (Okin 1999).\u00a0\n\nA worry\u00a0that runs through objections to these many cultural\npreservation rights\u00a0is that women may not be\u00a0willing\nparticipants in these cultures, and therefore that respecting cultural\npreservation rights consigns women to lives they would not\nchoose,\u00a0do not want, and cannot escape. But for many it is a\nmistake to assume that women members are such only under duress, since\nmany will deeply value the community itself and respect the norms and\nvalues that it seeks to protect, even if they reject certain among\nthem. In these cases, and where political theorists consider them,\nthere is an attempt to move from treating culture in encompassing\nterms towards treating it in dialogic and narrative terms. Cultures,\neven oppressive (to liberals) minority cultures, are subject to\nchange, and perhaps the best source of change is deeply committed\nmembers who willingly endorse key values but reject others, including\nthose that do not respect\u00a0the equal rights of women. Monique\nDeveaux\u2019s account of female adult participants in customary\nmarriages in South Africa, who accept some elements of their culture,\nbut who aim to gain a voice at the table to shift others, treats\nculture in dialogic terms (Deveaux 2007). Here, the key motivating\nthought is that cultures can and do shift over time, in response to\nhow its members engage in it, and what matters is not the change\nitself, but who or what is its source. On this view, the objective of\ncultural preservation rights is not to preserve culture per\nse, a challenge that would prove impossible in any case, but\nrather the right to protect the ability of group members to shape\ntheir culture and to protect it against unwelcome sources of\nchange.\n\nOthers argue that so long as women, and any others subject to rigid\ncultural demands, possess a right (or the capacity) to exit the\ncommunity, their choice to remain should be treated as such (Kukathas\n1992). For those who hold this view, efforts to render the\u00a0right\nto exit genuinely exercisable\u00a0are tremendously\nimportant\u00a0(Kukathas 2012; Holzleithner 2012). In so doing, a\nstate\u00a0must make a choice about the resources it provides to those\nmembers who may desire to exit, but who do not have the means to\nestablish themselves in the larger society. In some orthodox religious\ncommunities, property is owned in common and individual members do not\nhave any personal property or resources; as a result, exiters have\nnothing on which to rely while they establish their new lives. In\nothers, members are poorly educated, and unfamiliar with life outside\nof their own communities, and so exit without the capacity to sustain\nthemselves in the larger society.\u00a0 So, receiving states can offer\nsupport to exiters in various ways, for example\u00a0by providing\nshelters to exiting women (and men), in which education is provided so\nthat they may eventually attain self-sufficiency as a member of\nmainstream society.\u00a0The choice to support exiters may seem to\nundermine a culture\u2019s capacity for self-preservation.\u00a0But\nsupporting exiters is not well-understood as denying cultural\npreservation rights; rather, the choice to do so stems from a\nstate\u2019s commitment to protecting the rights of all of its\nmembers, including the most vulnerable, as best as it can do.\n2.6 Rights against cultural loss\n\nThe right to cultural preservation described above should be\ndistinguished from the slightly different right against coerced\ncultural loss, which focuses on preservation in cases where the\npotential loss is the result of coercion by outside forces against\nwhich a cultural group is relatively powerless. Of course, cultural\nchange\u00a0is inevitable in some form, as highlighted above,\nand especially if one\u00a0holds a culture-as-dialogue view, cultures\nare in fact never static.\u00a0Rather, practices,\u00a0norms, and\nvalues that are defining of a culture at one time may cease to be\ncentrally defining of that culture, for a whole range of reasons\nincluding economic, environmental, and political. So, in fact, some\namount of\u00a0cultural loss is inevitable, and moreover, it is not\nalways to be regretted. Sometimes, it is a normal response to external\nfactors that are beyond a culture\u2019s control, and sometimes it is\nwelcome because the changes result in the better protection of human\nrights or more inclusive cultural traditions and practices.\u00a0A\ncultural group may choose to shift their central modes of production\nin response to changing environmental factors, for example. So, as\nSamuel Scheffler has argued, the strong preservationist view of\nculture\u2014that cultures should be insulated from all forms of\nchange\u2014must be rejected (Scheffler 2007).\n\nYet, especially minority cultures may sometimes\u00a0have a reasonable\nclaim that they are not able to protect themselves against unwanted\ncultural change, or that they are not able to control the pace of\nchange. They may thereby be entitled to forms of state support, to\nhelp them create the conditions under which they can resist unwanted\ncultural change.\u00a0 When linguistic minorities request state\nsupport to persist in educating children in a minority language, for\nexample, sometimes the justification is in the name of protecting\nagainst the erosion of the language in the face of pressure to adopt\nor become fluent in the majority language.\n\nIn other cases, majorities are actively focused on undermining\nminority cultures, often over years and even decades. Colonial states\nhave pursued genocidal policies against Indigenous communities for\nexample, with the expressed purpose of undermining their capacity to\nsurvive as distinct peoples. In assessing cases of cultural loss,\nthen, a key factor\u00a0is whether the shift is forced upon\nminority groups, not necessarily by changing environmental or economic\nconditions, but by agents who intend to undermine the culture,\nby\u00a0actively disvaluing\u00a0it and thereby acting so as to\nundermine the conditions for its robust continuity. External,\nmalicious, factors that engender cultural change that would not\notherwise be expected,\u00a0make the change not only regrettable, but\ngenerate a case for reparations, for example with respect to\nIndigenous communities,\u00a0where there is \u201cevidence of a\nhistory of dispossession, discrimination, or subordination\u201d\n(Phillips 2018: 97).\n2.7 Cultural defense rights\n\nIn legal environments, wrong-doers sometimes deploy a cultural\ndefense, explaining that minority cultural norms and values, which are\nin tension with those of the majority, are causally relevant in\nexplaining why they committed a\u00a0wrong. A cultural defense has,\nthereby, sometimes been treated as a relevant mitigating factor in\nassigning punishment. The right to offer a cultural defense is\ntypically justified with respect to the importance of recognizing that\nminorities do not always operate according to the same values and\nnorms that are represented in the majority\u2019s legal system, and\nthat these differences are entitled to some consideration in legal\nspaces. Earlier court decisions accepted explanations that, for\nexample, men who murdered their unfaithful partners were moved to do\nso by a combination of shame and rage associated with cultural norms.\nFor example, men who claimed that \u201cgang rape\u201d (known\nculturally as marriage by capture) was mandated by Hmong culture as a\nway to secure a wife, in which women were not only complicit but in\nfact willing partners, are no longer understood to have a defense in\nlegal suits accusing them of rape (Song 2005). However, the power of\n\u201ccultural\u201d explanations in mainstream legal spaces has\ndecreased over time, as states have come to see how many of these\ndefenses are in fact cover for patriarchal, misogynist attitudes that\npersist, both in some minority communities and in the wider\ncommunity.\n\n\u201cCultural\u201d defenses of crime often amount to treating\nculture as though it were a homogeneous whole, and as though\nperpetrators of crime rather than its victims have a lock on its\ninterpretation. But \u201crespect for culture cannot mean deference\nto whatever the established authorities of culture deem right\u201d\n(Gutmann 2003: 46). Additionally, a generic imperative to\n\u201crespect culture\u201d in legal spaces can ignore the\ndifferences among types of cultural expectations, which can range from\npermissible acts, to encouraged acts and required acts, only some of\nwhich may justifiably be treated as legally relevant\u00a0(Vitikainen\n2015: 162). As well, it\u00a0can permit and encourage the\nrepresentation of minority (especially non-western) cultures as\nstereotypes, and \u201cmobilizes culture in ways that encourage\nabsurdly large generalizations about people from particular cultural\ngroups\u201d (Phillips 2007: 81 & 99). The danger represented by\nan uncritical acceptance of the cultural defense is in a treatment of\nculture as so encompassing that it treats its members as incapable of\nautonomous decision-making. But, say critics of the cultural defense,\nthis is a mistake\u2014along with many other factors, culture can be\npart of an explanation for engaging in wrong-doing, but should\n\u201cnever be mistaken for the whole truth\u201d (Phillips 2007:\n98).\n2.8 Exclusive cultural use rights (or rights against cultural appropriation)\n\nA final cultural right that is claimed by some is the right to control\ncultural artifacts or expressions, or the use of cultural content in\ngeneral (Matthes 2016). This is the right that is at issue in recent\ncontroversies focused on cultural appropriation, defined as the use,\nby a non-member, of \u201csomething of cultural value, usually a\nsymbol or a practice, to others\u201d (Lenard & Balint 2020).\nFamiliar examples of actions that have been accused of engaging\nin\u00a0cultural appropriation include the wearing of dreadlocks by\nwhites; the donning of Indigenous clothing as Halloween costumes; the\nuse of turbans in high fashion; the teaching of yoga by instructors\nwho do not have South Asian backgrounds. In all of these cases, a\nnon-member is accused of \u201cappropriating\u201d a particular\ncultural practice or symbol that is not their own. On this view,\ncultures have exclusive rights to use their cultural\n\u201cproducts\u201d as they see fit, often because that practice is\nunderstood to be central to their identity. This perspective is\ncontroversial, and often mocked, by those who observe that history\njust is the mingling and sharing of cultural practices and symbols,\nincluding in the spaces of cuisine, the arts, dress and spiritual\npractices; their mocking treats the rights claim as relying on an\nunderstanding of culture that is unchanging and immutable over time,\nwhich is historically inaccurate and, furthermore, undesirable.\nCorrespondingly, key cultural artifacts are best understood as\nbelonging to \u201chumanity\u201d: \u201cit isn\u2019t peoples who\nexperience and value art: it\u2019s men and women\u201d (Appiah\n2009).\n\nThe right claimed\u2014to full or exclusive use of defining cultural\npractices or symbols\u2014is perhaps not best enforced by the state,\nthough states can and do engage in practices that are attentive to the\nharms allegedly caused\u00a0by cultural appropriation. For example,\ncentralized support for the arts, in the form of grants to produce\nartistic endeavours, can be sensitive to who is asking for\nsupport to produce what, and can direct funding towards\nartists from a particular tradition who aim to produce culturally\nspecific products, and correspondingly refuse (unless very good reason\nis offered) to support endeavours by cultural outsiders to produce\n\u201cinsider\u201d art (Rowell 1995; J. O. Young 2008). The right\nclaimed is\u00a0relatively stronger where a particular cultural\ncommunity is the victim of a power imbalance, where the cultural\ncommunity has expressly requested that a particular practice or symbol\nbe \u201cleft alone\u201d by a majority community, and where members\nof the majority community are\u00a0profiting on the basis of\nits use of the particular symbol or practice (Lenard & Balint\n2020). As in other cases, the right claimed by a cultural group is\nstrongest where there are persistent inequalities between the minority\nclaimant and the majority group.\n3. Majority Cultural Rights Claims\n\nSection 2 considered the cultural rights claims that are, usually,\nmade by minority groups. Majority groups make cultural claims as well,\nin particular with respect to excluding others from their territory as\nwell as with respect to what can be demanded of those who are\nadmitted.\n3.1 Cultural continuity and exclusion rights\n\nOne domain in which majority communities claim a cultural right is in\nthe space of immigration. For some, the right of states to shape their\nculture can legitimately serve as a reason to exclude others, in\ngeneral and sometimes specific others. This view is often attributed\nto Michael Walzer, who argues that the right of a state to control its\nborders is intimately connected to its capacity to\n\n\ndefend the liberty and welfare, the politics and culture of a\ngroup of people committed to one another and to their common life.\n(Walzer 1983: 39, emphasis added)\n\n\nThe right of a state to control its culture is therefore an essential\none to protect its \u201ccollective consciousness\u201d, as noted in\nSection 1.\n\nThis claim has encountered pushback from many scholars, for multiple\nreasons. One reason is that the claim that a state may exclude\nwould-be migrants for cultural reasons has too often been, in\nfact, an attempt to enact discriminatory legislation aimed at\nexcluding migrants whose beliefs and practices are said\u00a0to be\nincompatible with, or even undermining of, the values and norms that\ndefine the majority\u2019s culture. Exclusion based on so-called\ncultural reasons has often been a claim that a state prefers to remain\nculturally, religiously, ethnically, and racially homogeneous.\nHistorically, states engaged explicitly in such discriminatory\npractices, which have now been repudiated, including for example\nvariants of Asian Exclusion Acts which were in operation in North\nAmerica in the early 1900s.\n\nThe same accusation is also merited in several recent cases, such as\nthe implementation of the so-called Muslim Ban in the United States,\nor with respect to proposals during the height of the crisis in Syria\n(2015) in some countries to prioritize Christian over Muslim refugees\n(Song 2018). Among political theorists of immigration, there is\nhowever widespread repudiation of discriminatory immigration policies,\nboth explicitly and implicitly, even among those who defend the\ngeneral right of states to exclude would-be migrants and refugees, for\nmany reasons including to preserve culture (Miller 2005).\n\nA second source of pushback stems from a more general skepticism that\na majority\u2019s culture, even if genuinely valuable to its members,\nshould be treated as sufficiently so to warrant excluding migrants,\nespecially necessitous ones (the language of necessity is borrowed\nfrom Song 2018). Even if it is conceded that culture is valuable to a\nmajority, many scholars believe that its protection cannot warrant\nexcluding those in severe need of safety or subsistence.\n\nYet, say those who defend the view that culture can, at least in some\ncases, serve to exclude migrants, there is a case to be made for\ntreating the state as possessing the right to cultural continuity\n(Miller 2005). This claimed right looks very much like the right to\ncultural preservation (or against cultural loss) described above, and\nit highlights not so much the sentimental dimensions of a\nmajority\u2019s attachment to its culture, but rather its pragmatic\ninterpretation. On this view, any particular state is defined by a\n\u201cshared public culture\u201d which, because shared, underpins\nthe trust that democratic states rely on to pursue political and\nsocial objectives in common. No particular value that makes up a\nshared public culture is valuable in and of itself. Rather, it is the\ncombination of a set of values, norms, and practices, that produces\n\u201cour\u201d culture that is valuable, and in its presence, trust\nis higher; as a result, so is the willingness to cooperate to support\npolicies that require some sacrifice, including for example,\ncommitment to redistributive social policies that are especially to\nthe benefit of those who are least well-off (e.g., see the essays in\nGustavsson & Miller 2019). So, according to those who defend these\nviews, a\u00a0state that seeks to exert control over admission citing\n\u201ccultural\u201d reasons is neither racist nor discriminatory,\nbut rather is seeking controlled admission (rather than closed\nborders) so that newcomers can, over a sufficient time period, come to\nadopt enough of the set of defining values, norms, and practices, to\nbe able to warrant and extend the trust that underpins the policies\nthat instantiate these objectively valued goods.\n3.2 Cultural continuity and integration enforcement rights\n\nStates that defend the right of cultural continuity at the level of\nadmission to a state typically also deploy the right to adopt and\nenforce \u201cintegration\u201d policies that encourage newcomers to\nadopt majority\u00a0norms and values, arguing that the faster such\nadoption happens, the more rapid admission itself can be. Integration\npolicies ask newcomers to adopt the norms and practices of the\nmajority community, whereas accommodation policies ask the majority to\naccommodate practices that are distinct from those that define the\nmajority\u2019s culture. On this conventional multicultural view, the\nprocess by which migrants are admitted to the territory, and then to\nmembership, is a \u201ctwo-way\u201d street, requiring that both\nnewcomers and the host state adapt in response to each other (Kymlicka\n1998).\n\nIs the demand that newcomers integrate culturally reasonable?\nIs it reasonable, that is, to ask immigrants to adopt the norms,\nvalues, and practices that are central to the culture they have joined\n(l will leave aside the question of economic and political\nintegration, here)? Notice that in the political and sociological\nliterature in immigration incorporation, integration (culturally) is\ntypically distinguished from assimilation, where the former focuses on\nwelcoming newcomers with the distinct sets of norms and values that\ntravel with them (and so accommodating them where possible), and the\nlatter demands that immigrants adopt as fully as possible the set of\nnorms and values that are central to the host society (Brubaker 2001;\nsee also Modood 2007). In the political theory literature on\nmulticulturalism, however, it is widely accepted that a demand for\nfull assimilation is normatively problematic (it requires too much of\nimmigrants, to abandon their histories and identities, as part of\njoining a new community), but\u00a0that some form of encouragement to\nintegrate is permissible.\n\nWhether the integration demands are permissible depends on at least\ntwo connected things, however: first, on the content of the shared\npublic culture and, second, on the accessibility of the venues in\nwhich the content of this public culture is deliberated. The space in\nwhich a culture is deliberated is amorphous as well as expansive. The\nsource of key norms, practices, and values is multi-fold: some are\nhistorical, some are deliberately adopted through political processes,\nsome are accidentally adopted in response to contingent\ncircumstances.\u00a0The demand that newcomers integrate, in the sense\nof adopt the norms and practices of the majority culture to at least a\nreasonable extent is more defensible in cases where access to spaces\nin which they are deliberated is public and therefore open to\nmany voices. The precise meaning of \u201caccessibility\u201d to\nspaces that are not clearly defined, and entry to which is not\nmonitored or policed in any formal way, is challenging to pin down.\nBut the key point is that to the extent that cultures welcome and take\nseriously new voices\u2014in public media, in political spaces, and\nso on\u2014they can be described as publicly accessible. So, there is\na connection between the legitimacy of demanding adherence to majority\nculture norms and practices, as part of the process of integration,\nand the genuine access that newcomers have to the spaces in which they\nare deliberated.\n\nIn considering the second question, with respect to the content of a\nmajority\u2019s shared public culture, I borrow from the literature\nin the political theory of nationalism (though I do not believe that\nthe language of nationalism itself is essential to appreciate\nits relevance to the discussion here). A culture can be defined by\nfeatures that are more or less inclusive. Where cultures are defined\nby characteristics that are typically used to describe ethnic nations,\nincluding shared history, religion, ethnicity/race, newcomers are less\neasily able to join them and be recognized as full members. Where\ncultures are defined by characteristics that are typically used, on\nthe other hand, to describe civic nations, including shared commitment\nto political institutions and, usually, a commitment to liberal\ndemocratic principles, then they are more welcoming for newcomers. In\nthe language adopted earlier in this entry, cultures that are defined\nby exclusive features are more likely to treat culture as\nencompassing, whereas cultures that adopt inclusive features, and\nemphasize accessibility to the forums in which its content is\ndeliberated, treat culture in dialogic or identity terms. This need\nnot be the case, though, since those who treat culture in dialogic\nterms may nevertheless believe that key elements of history or\nreligion are central to it (though they are open to deliberation about\nthe appropriateness of these elements as central) and similarly\nidentities can be formulated on the basis of exclusionary\nfeatures.\n\nAnother way to define inclusivity focuses attention on the extent to\nwhich\u00a0a culture\u2019s main norms, practices, and values can be\nadopted by newcomers without their giving up something they\nvalue (Lenard 2019). Key here is to define the permissible contours of\nan inclusive culture that, at the same time, can serve to distinguish\nit from others in ways that resolve what philosophers have called the\n\u201cparticularity\u201d problem. If cultures are defined\nonly by commitment to liberal democratic principles and the\ninstitutions that instantiate them, then a person will necessarily be\ncommitted to any state that is so defined. But this conclusion does\nnot make sense of the reality that many citizens are attached to\ntheir state\u2019s interpretation of these\nvalues\u2014fundamental, abstract, liberal democratic\nprinciples\u00a0are adopted, respected, and instantiated, in other\nwords, in a culturally specific way. It is important, then, to\ndelineate the boundary of permissible cultural content, which can\ninclude recognition of key historical moments, or political\nconversations, or cultural icons. No state can demand of newcomers\nthat their emotional commitment be to their new state; but it can\nreasonably impart information about learnable key cultural markers,\nencourage newcomers to adopt the associated practices and norms, and\nhope that over time their emotional identification shifts to the host\nstate, at least partially (Carens 2005). Under the condition that the\npublic cultural content of a host state is reasonably\naccessible, and that the forums in which it is deliberated are\nlikewise reasonably accessible, then the host state can\npermissibly\u00a0encourage the integration of newcomers. This right is\nperhaps best understood as derivative of the right to cultural\ncontinuity that states claim in relation to immigration, which\ncan\u00a0permissibly be claimed if and only if the accessibility\nconditions described above are met.\n\nNot all scholars agree on this point, of course, and some reject\nentirely the suggestion\u00a0that newcomers can be asked to make\naccommodations to the culture of the state that they have joined.\nThose who adopt variants on this view treat the majority\u2019s\nculture as nearly always homogeneous and oppressive in ways that are\ndisrespectful of newcomers, and treat the demand for integration along\nat least some dimensions as \u201ccleaned up\u201d variations on the\ndiscriminatory and racist immigration policies of the past (Abizadeh\n2002). This is a real worry. When the Netherlands demanded that\npotential migrants from majority Muslim countries watch a video and\npass a test merely to gain entry to its territory\u2014a video that\nshowed gay men kissing and a topless woman\u2014it was widely\nexcoriated for its discriminatory intent, rather than (as was claimed)\nan attempt to ensure that migrants could adopt the liberal values that\nsupposedly characterized the country\u2019s culture. More generally,\nthe mechanisms of encouraging the learning and adoption of the\nmajority culture\u2019s values, in addition to its actual content as\ndelineated above, as well as the consequences for failure to do so,\nmust be scrutinized for their reasonableness. This assessment is a\ntricky business, certainly, made trickier because in many (if not\nmost) immigration situations, the potential newcomer is in a situation\nof vulnerability in relation to the host state: their interest in\ngaining entry is very strong and so in many cases, they will accept\nheavy-handed attempts to coerce their integration\u00a0without\ncomplaint.\n4. Conclusion\n\nBoth minority groups (many of which are immigrant groups) and majority\ngroups claim that \u201cculture\u201d is important and deserving of\naccommodation in multiple ways. This entry began with an examination\nof the multiple ways in which culture has been understood, to unpack\nthe ways in which it is deployed when specific cultural rights are\nclaimed. It is important to notice that these cultural claims, on both\nsides, are often made in relation to each other: a minority group\ndemands a particular cultural right and the majority responds by\nclaiming a different cultural right. In many cases, the choice to\nrespect or ignore claimed cultural rights is framed in terms of the\nimpact that doing so will have on the culture of the majority, for\nexample, by stating that a particular practice for which accommodation\nis requested is incompatible with the majority culture in general, or\nsometimes more specifically with a particular practice or norm that is\nbelieved to be particularly important. The latter claim was made, for\nexample, in France, during \u201cl\u2019affaire du\nfoulard\u201d\u2014the right to cover one\u2019s head as a\nmanifestation of Islamic (or Jewish) religious commitment was denied\nfor the way in which it compromised the French\u2019s commitment to\nlaicity (Laborde 2008; Benhabib 2004).\n\nThis entry has attempted to offer the resources that are essential to\nadjudicating these conflicts, in ways that take seriously both those\nwho demand cultural rights\u00a0and those who resist respecting them.\nHopefully, future political theory can make use of this taxonomy to\nidentify satisfactory conclusions to these conflicts when they\narise.\n", "bibliography": {"categories": [], "cat_ref_text": {"ref_list": ["Abizadeh, Arash, 2002, \u201cDoes Liberal Democracy Presuppose a\nCultural Nation?
