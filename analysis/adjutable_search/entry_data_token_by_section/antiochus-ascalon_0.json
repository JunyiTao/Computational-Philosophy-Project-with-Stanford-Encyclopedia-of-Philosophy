    "main_text": "Life,  Works and Background\n1. Life,  Works and Background \n\n\nAntiochus was born in the latter part of the second century B.C.E. in\nAscalon (whose site is in present-day Israel) and died in 69/8\nB.C.E. (On Antiochus\u2019 life, see Hatzimichali 2012). Early in life he\nmoved to Athens, at this time still the center of the ancient\nphilosophical world, where he became a member of the Academy, the\nphilosophical school founded by Plato in the fourth century B.C.E. He\nmay also have studied with certain of the Stoic philosophers then\nactive in Athens. His membership in the Academy dates from around 110\nB.C.E., the date when Philo of Larissa became the school\u2019s head, or\nscholarch. At this time Philo championed a form of the skepticism that\nhad been defended in the Academy since the scholarchate of \n Arcesilaus,\nin the first half of the third century B.C.E. Antiochus was for many\nyears a student and follower of Philo, whose views he defended in his\nwritings, but at an uncertain point (though before 79 B.C.E.;\nsee Section 3) he broke sharply with Philo and\nrejected skepticism (Cicero, Acad.  2.69).\n\nA measure of caution is in order. \u201cSkeptic\u201d is an ancient\nGreek term meaning inquirer. The Academics did not use it of\nthemselves; The descriptive appellation \u2018skeptic[al] \u2019 was\nfirst applied by Pyrrhonians to their school in order to signal their\ncommitment to open-minded inquiry (see the overview in the entry on\n ancient skepticism). Understood in\nthis way, the term applies at least as well to the skeptical Academy\nas to the Pyrrhonian school, which was founded or revived by\nAenesidemus, an Academic who reacted against what he saw as an\nincreasingly dogmatic tendency in the Academy of his time in the first\ncentury B.C.E. Later in antiquity the term \u201cskeptic\u201d seems\nto have been applied to both schools.  A range of arguments that, in\none way or another, call the existence or possibility of knowledge\ninto question, together with the positions or attitudes taken in\nresponse to, or expressed by, these arguments, have been styled\n\u201cskeptical\u201d, and several forms of skepticism were defended\nby different Academics in the course of the school\u2019s history.\n\n\nFrom his break with Philo Antiochus was a dogmatist, who maintained\nthat knowledge was possible and that there were truths known to him\nand other human beings. It is clear that he began a new school of\nthought and attracted followers. Later in antiquity, when different\nphases in the history of the Academy corresponding to changes in\ndoctrine and philosophical approach were distinguished, some people\nspoke of a fourth Academy of Philo and a fifth of Antiochus (Sextus\nEmpiricus [S.E.], Outlines of Pyrrhonism, i.e.,\nPyrrhoneae hypotyposes [PH] 1.220). These\ndistinctions were not meant to correspond to changes in the Academy as\nan institution, and evidence about institutional developments and the\nrelations between them and Antiochus\u2019 change in intellectual direction\nis fragmentary and unclear. It is not plain, e.g., whether he began\nexpounding his new views while still a member of the Academy or after\nforming a group around himself, which he dubbed the \u2018Old Academy\u2019 in\norder to signal his allegiance to the original Old Academy of Plato\nand his immediate successors and to contrast it with the \u2018New Academy\u2019\nof Philo and his predecessors from the time of Arcesilaus (cf. Polito\n2012) \n\n\nPolitical instability in Athens led Philo to transfer his activities\nto Rome in 88 B.C.E. We know that Antiochus was in Alexandria the\nfollowing year in the company of Lucullus, a Roman general and\nstatesman, with whom he maintained ties for the rest of his life. He\nalso exerted an influence on other prominent Romans. Cicero, though\nnot a follower of his, studied with Antiochus in Athens in 79.  Varro,\napart from Cicero the greatest Roman intellectual of the first century\nB.C.E., and Brutus, the assassin of Caesar, were adherents of\nAntiochus\u2019 philosophy (on Varro, see Blank 2012).\n\n\nNone of Antiochus\u2019 books have survived, but we know something\nabout them. He wrote an epistemological work called Canonica\nin at least two books. The title comes from\n\u2018kan\u00f4n,\u2019 meaning a ruler or straightedge, a\nterm that was used by philosophers in the Hellenistic period for the\nstandard or criterion of truth. It is cited by Sextus Empiricus in his\nsurvey of views about the criterion of truth at Against the\nprofessors, i.e., Adversus Mathematicos [M]\n7.162, 202, and modern scholars have conjectured that it was\nSextus\u2019 source for much of that survey (cf. Tarrant, 1985,\n94\u20136; Sedley, 1992). The Sosus, possibly a dialogue,\nwas also an epistemological work and belonged to the last phase of\nAntiochus\u2019 controversy with Philo\n(Cicero, Acad. 2.12). He wrote a book about the gods,\nconcerning which we know nothing more.  He sent a book to the Roman\nStoic, Balbus, in which he maintained that, despite differences in\nterminology, the Stoics and Peripatetics (as Aristotle\u2019s\nsuccessors in his school, the Peripatos, were called) were largely in\nagreement on matters of substance (Cicero, N.D. 1.16). And\nCicero informs us that he wrote in many places about his view of the\nrelation between happiness and virtue (T.D. 5.22).\n",
