Structuring Conceptual Space Beyond Pluralism\n\nSo far some of the pluralistic directions that discussions of\nDistinctions and Conceptual Space have taken in the literature have\nbeen outlined, leading to a conceptual landscape populated by a\nplethora of adjectivally-modified kinds of individuals: evolutionary,\nphysiological, developmental, functional, genetic, etc.. Although\nsimply equating biological individuals with organisms would be a\nmistake, some biologists (e.g., Pepper & Herron 2008; cf. Jagers\nop Akkerhuis 2010) have explored the idea that a more nuanced appeal\nto organisms can provide some informative structure to this landscape.\nNoting that \n\n\namongst biologists, the question of what constitutes an individual is\nusually identical with the question of what constitutes an individual\norganism. (Pepper & Herron 2008: 622) \n\n\nPepper and Herron pose the question of whether any given biological\nindividual is an organism, a part of an organism, or a group of\norganisms. Consider then a framework that holds that biological\nindividuals include exactly:\n\norganisms (such as wasps and whales)\nsome parts of organisms (such as placentas and plasmids)\nand\nsome groups of organisms (such as zebra lineages and\ncolonies of bacteria).\n\n\nFigure 2 depicts this framework visually.\n\n\n\nFigure 2: A Framework for Structuring\nConceptual Space. [An\n extended description of figure 2\n is in the supplement.]\n\n\nThese three sub-categories of biological individual need not be\nmutually exclusive when considering any particular individual. For\nexample, a given bacterium, such as an individual Buchnera\nbacterium, may both be an organism itself and be part of a corporate\norganism, such as the human whose gut it is integral to (Andersson\n2000). Likewise, some groups, such as the colonies of eusocial insects\nsometimes called \u201csuperorganisms\u201d, or highly integrated\nmultispecies communities, may be true organisms. This kind of\nview may also capture what truth lies behind proposals to extend the\nterm organism both to some parts and some groups of organisms\n(e.g., Queller 1997; Okasha 2011): parts of organisms (such as\nsymbiotic gut bacteria), as well as groups of organisms (such as\ncolonies of ants or bees), are really organisms as well. \n\nDirectly relevant to the Focal Question is that this framework invites\na more systematic treatment of the relationship between each of the\nprimary kinds of biological individuals\u2014evolutionary and\nphysiological individuals\u2014and other key features typically\nappealed to in characterizing them, including growth, reproduction,\nlineages, cohesion, metabolism, and control.\n Sections 6 and 7\n will elaborate the initial visual summary offered by\n Figure 2\n in ways that further fill out the conceptual space occupied by\nbiological individuals. But first\n Section 5\n attends to the right-hand side of Figure 2 by providing a brief\noverview of the idea of groups as biological individuals.\n",
