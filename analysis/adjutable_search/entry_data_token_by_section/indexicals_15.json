    "main_text": "Kaplan\u2019s Theory of Indexicals || Utterances and Expressions in Kaplan\u2019s Theory\n3.6 Utterances and Expressions in Kaplan\u2019s Theory\n\n\nLinguistic expressions should be distinguished from utterances.\nLinguistic expressions are abstract objects. Utterances are events in\nwhich an agent utters a linguistic expression. The word\n\u2018the\u2019 is a single linguistic expression, but two utterances\nof it occur in every utterance of the sentence \u2018The philosopher\nsaw the linguist\u2019.\n\n\nKaplan\u2019s theory does not ascribe characters or contents to\nutterances. Rather, it ascribes characters to linguistic expressions,\nand contents to expressions with respect to contexts. In fact,\nKaplan\u2019s theory ascribes contents to expressions with respect to\ncontexts in which no one utters those expressions. For example, on\nKaplan\u2019s theory, the sentence \u2018I exist\u2019 has a content\nwith respect to every context, and is true in every context, including\ncontexts in which the agent does not utter that sentence, and including\ncontexts in which no one in the world of the context speaks English.\nThe sentence \u2018I utter nothing\u2019 is true in some contexts, on\nKaplan\u2019s theory, for there are contexts \\(c\\) in which the\nagent \\(A\\) of \\(c\\) utters nothing in the world of\n\\(c\\), and the content of the sentence in \\(c\\) is the\nproposition that \\(A\\) utters nothing, which is true in the world\nof \\(c\\). This is why Kaplan speaks of the agent of a\ncontext rather than the speaker of a context.\n\n\nNevertheless, Kaplan\u2019s theory still has implications for\nutterances and speech acts. Suppose that Mary utters the sentence\n\u2018I am a philosopher\u2019 in world \\(w\\). Mary\u2019s\nutterance has an agent in \\(w\\), namely Mary, and it occurs at a\ncertain location and time in \\(w\\). So, her utterance in\n\\(w\\) determines a Kaplanian context. Call this context\n\u2018Mary\u2019s context\u2019. On Kaplan\u2019s theory, the\nsentence Mary utters has a content in Mary\u2019s context, namely the\nsingular proposition that Mary is a philosopher. If Mary utters the\nsentence assertively, then she (probably) asserts the content of that\nsentence in her context. So, Kaplan\u2019s theory, together with other\nplausible assumptions, has important implications for what Mary asserts\nin her utterance.\n\n\nFor further discussion of utterances and expressions, see\nReichenbach 1947, Garcia-Carpintero 1998, Kaplan 1999, Perry 2000, and\nsection 5.3 below.\n",
