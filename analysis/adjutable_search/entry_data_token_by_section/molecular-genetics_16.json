What do genes and DNA do?\n\n\nThe science called molecular genetics is associated with a fundamental\ntheory according to which genes and DNA direct all basic life\nprocesses by providing the information specifying the development and\nfunctioning of organisms. The genome is said to specify the\n\u201cdevelopmental program,\u201d \u201cmaster plan,\u201d or\n\u201cblue print\u201d for development while other elements provide\nthe materials (e.g., Bonner 1965, Jacob and Monod 1961, Mayr 1961,\nMaynard Smith 2000, Rosenberg 2006). Although the idea that the\nchromosomes contain a \u201ccode-script\u201d for the development\nand functioning of an organism was famously expressed by Schrodinger\n(1944) before the era of molecular genetics, today it is often\nexpressed in explicitly molecular terms. The information of\ndevelopment and function, which is passed down from one generation to\nthe next, is allegedly encoded in the nucleotide sequences comprising\ngenes and DNA. This so-called \u201cgenetic information\u201d is\nfirst \u201ctranscribed\u201d into RNA, then\n\u201ctranslated\u201d into proteins, and finally\n\u201cexpressed\u201d in the development and functioning of\norganisms.\n\n\nThe concept of genetic information has a prominent place in the\nhistory of molecular genetics, beginning with Watson and Crick's\nobservation that since any sequence of nucleotide base pairs could fit\ninto the structure of any DNA molecule \u201cthat in a long molecule\nmany different permutations are possible, and it therefore seems\nlikely that the precise sequence of the bases is the code which\ncarries the genetic information.\u201d (Watson and Crick 1953). As\nDownes (2005) recounts, the geneticists Jacob and Monod reinforced the\nuse of information language as did those who sought to crack the\n\u201cgenetic code\u201d. By the early 1960s, the language of\ninformation was well-entrenched in the field of molecular\ngenetics.\n\n\nPhilosophers have generally criticized the theory that genes and DNA\nprovide all the information and have challenged the use of sweeping\nmetaphors such as \u201cmaster plan\u201d and \u201cprogam\u201d\nwhich suggest that genes and DNA contain all developmental\ninformation. Critics have taken a number of different positions. Most\nseem to accept the notion that biological systems or processes contain\ninformation, but they deny the idea that DNA has a exceptional role in\nproviding information. Some are content to argue that under various\nexisting theories of information, such as causal theories or standard\nteleosemantic theories, information is not restricted to DNA. But\nothers contend that understanding what genes do requires a new\nconception of biological information. One approach is to retreat to a\nnarrow conception of coding specifically aimed at clarifying the sense\nin which DNA provides information for the synthesis of polypeptides,\nbut not for higher-level traits (e.g.  Godfrey-Smith 2000). Another\napproach is to construct a new, broad conception of biological\ninformation and use this conception to show that the informational\nrole of genes is not exclusive (Jablonka 2002).  A different approach\nis to abandon information talk altogether and explain the\ninvestigative and explanatory reasoning associated with genetics and\nmolecular biology in purely causal terms.\n",
