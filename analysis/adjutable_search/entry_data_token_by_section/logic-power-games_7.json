    "main_text": "Analyzing Power || .7 Logic-Based Games\n4. Conclusions: On the Right Level of Analysis\n\nRecall the very first example, in which the set of outcomes of a\nvoting game could be described only considering the overall outcome of\nthe vote or by explicitly describing what each of the Countries had\nvoted.\n\nOften times, when describing mathematical structures by succinct\nlanguages we are confronted with the question of which one is the most\nsuitable language. Some are able to express preferences, knowledge and\ncoalitional ability all together, some others only two of these,\nsome others only one. Finally some languages might only be able\nto express what individuals, and not coalitions, can achieve.\n\nAgain, there is no right answer to this question. It all depends on\nwhat the fundamental characteristics are that one is trying to model.\nTo express Nash equilibria in a coordination game, there is no need\nfor a temporal logic-based formalism. On the contrary, if one wants to\nexpress backwards induction, then a language that does not make the\nsequential structure of the decision problem explicit is probably not\nthe right one.\n\nGoing back to our example, some Countries might have preferences over\nhow other Countries vote, and this might affect their decision-making,\nchanging the overall equilibrium points of the game. If this is the\ncase then the richer language matters. Otherwise, if we can safely\nrule out this possibility, the more succinct language seems to be the\nappropriate choice.\n",
