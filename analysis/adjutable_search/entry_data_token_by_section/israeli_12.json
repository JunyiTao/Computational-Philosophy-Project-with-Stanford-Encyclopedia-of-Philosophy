    "main_text": "Psychology || The Perfection of the Rational Soul\n4.3 The Perfection of the Rational Soul\n\nIn addition to an emanative/generative order, a prominent feature of\nNeoplatonist philosophy is the idea that through withdrawal from\nbodily desires, and perfection of the intellect, one\u2019s rational\nsoul can attain unity with the higher world. The early\nNeoplatonists\u2014those outside of the \u201crevealed\u201d\nmonotheistic traditions of Islam, Judaism and\nChristianity\u2014suggest that it is possible for the rational soul\nto achieve unity with The One/God. However, the Neoplatonists who were\nmembers of established monotheist religions do not think that\none\u2019s rational soul is capable of so high an ascent up the\nemanative chain, and advocation of such belief might have lead to\nprosecution for blasphemy or heresy. Nonetheless, Neoplatonists of\nreligious traditions did think that the rational soul\u2019s union\nwith the realm of intellect was possible. Neoplatonists from Proclus\nonwards describe unification as a three-part process, which Altmann\nand Stern characterize as Purification\u2014Illumination\u2014Union.\nFor Israeli, the Purification stage involves three activities: an\nascetic rejection of bodily desires and pleasures, and the dominance\nof the two lower souls; a worship of God combined with ethical\nbehavior towards one\u2019s fellow men; and the study of philosophy\nto develop one\u2019s rational soul. In the second stage, the soul is\nilluminated by truth. In the third stage, one\u2019s rational soul\nbecomes spiritual and divine, though not achieving full unity with the\nCreator.\n",
