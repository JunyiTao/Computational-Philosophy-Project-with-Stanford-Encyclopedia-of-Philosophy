Rights of Future People vis-\u00e0-vis Presently Living People\n\nOn a person-affecting view, future people count if, and insofar as,\nthey have interests, just claims, or rights vis-\u00e0-vis currently\nliving people. Some philosophers deny that this can ever be the case.\nIn addition to an argument reflecting the\n\u201cNon-Identity-Problem\u201d\n (\u00a7\u00a72.2; 3\u20134.3)\n we can distinguish at least three further arguments in support of the\ndenial of the possibility of future people having rights\nvis-\u00e0-vis us.\n",
