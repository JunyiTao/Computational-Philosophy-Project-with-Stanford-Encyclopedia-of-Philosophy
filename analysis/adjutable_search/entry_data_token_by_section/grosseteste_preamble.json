    "main_text": "\nRobert Grosseteste (ca. 1168\u20131253), Bishop of Lincoln from 1235 to\n1253, was one of the most prominent and remarkable figures in\nthirteenth-century English intellectual life. He was a man of many\ntalents: commentator and translator of Aristotle and Greek patristic\nthinkers, philosopher, theologian, and student of nature. He was\nheavily influenced by Augustine, whose thought permeates his writings\nand from whom he drew a Neoplatonic outlook, but he was also one of\nthe first to make extensive use of the thought of Aristotle, Avicenna\nand Averroes.  He developed a highly original and imaginative\naccount of the generation and fundamental nature of the physical world\nin terms of the action of light, and composed a number of short works\nregarding optics and other natural phenomena, as well as works of\nphilosophy and theology. As bishop, he was an important figure in\nEnglish ecclesiastical life, focusing his energies on rooting out\nabuses of the pastoral care, which in later life he traced to the\npapacy itself.  He made a powerful impression on his\ncontemporaries and subsequent thinkers at Oxford, and has been hailed\nas an inspiration to scientific developments in fourteenth-century\nOxford.\n",
