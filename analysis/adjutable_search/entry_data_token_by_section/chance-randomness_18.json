Saving the Thesis: Alternative Conceptions of Chance and Randomness\n\n\nThe discussion in\n \u00a7\u00a74\u20135\n leaves RCT in a doubtful position. But it may be that\nthe problems for RCT are due more to some defect in the theories of\nchance and randomness sketched in\n \u00a7\u00a71\u20132.\n As noted earlier, there are\nalternative conceptions of chance and randomness that have some appeal\nand might perhaps save RCT. They won\u2019t have much to say about the modal\nproblems for merely possible random sequences mentioned when RCT was\nfirst introduced. But perhaps the other objections can be avoided. The\nproblems for RCT arise fundamentally because of the split between\nproduct randomness and process chance. Closing this gap promises to aid\nRCT. This following two subsections will consider product conceptions\nof chance and process based conceptions of randomness.\n",
