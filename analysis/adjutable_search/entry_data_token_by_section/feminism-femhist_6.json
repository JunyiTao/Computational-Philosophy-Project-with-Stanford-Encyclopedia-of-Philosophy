    "main_text": "Feminist Appropriation of Canonical Philosophers\n3. Feminist Appropriation of Canonical Philosophers\n\n\nFeminist philosophers have also changed the history of philosophy by\nappropriating its ideas for feminist purposes. From the perspective of\nnegative canon formation, the history of philosophy is a resource only\nin so far as it describes the theories and thinkers that were most\ndeeply mistaken about women. Other feminist historians of philosophy\nhave found important resources for feminism in canonical philosophers.\nIndeed, they have found valuable concepts even in the worst offenders\nof the negative canon, like Aristotle and Descartes.\n\n\nFor example, in The Fragility of Goodness Martha Nussbaum\nhas described the virtues of an Aristotelian ethics with its emphasis\non the importance of concrete context, emotion and care for others in\nan ethical life (Nussbaum 1986). And Marcia Homiak has argued that\nAristotle's rational ideal, far from being antithetical to feminists,\nactually captures some of feminism's deepest ethical insights (Homiak\n1993). With regard to Descartes, Margaret Atherton has argued that his\nconcept of reason was interpreted in egalitarian rather than\nmasculinist terms by several women philosophers of the 18th century,\nand was used in their arguments for equal education for \nwomen.[11]\n\n\nOther feminists have urged the reconsideration of the views of\ncanonical figures, like Hume and Dewey, who have played only a minor\nrole in the negative feminist canon. For example, Annette Baier has\nargued at length for the value of a Humean perspective in both\nepistemology and in ethics for feminist theory (Baier 1987; Baier\n1993). And, in Pragmatism and Feminism Charlene Seigfried\nargues for the value of pragmatism for feminism; a position also taken\nby Richard Rorty (Seigfried 1996; Rorty 1991).\n\n\nIt is interesting to note that some of the very same philosophers\nwho were cast as the villains of the negative canon are also mined by\nfeminist theorists for useful ideas. Indeed, it is likely that every\nphilosopher, from Plato to Nietzsche, who has been condemned to the\nnegative canon also appears in some feminist's positive canon. This is\nperplexing. After all, if feminists evaluate canonical texts so\ndifferently, it raises questions about the coherence of feminist\ninterpretations of texts. Is Aristotle a feminist hero or villain? Are\nDescartes' ideas dangerous for feminists or useful to them? If\nfeminists have argued both positions, we begin to suspect that there is\nno such thing as a feminist interpretation of a philosopher. And this\nmight lead us to wonder about the coherence and unity of the project of\nfeminist canon revision.\n\n\nWhy is it that feminist philosophers have reached different, and\neven sometimes incompatible interpretations of the history of\nphilosophy? The multiple and contrary readings of the\nphilosophical canon by feminists reflects the contested nature of the\n\u201cus\u201d of contemporary feminism. The fact that feminist interpretations\nof canonical figures is diverse reflects, and is a part of, on-going\ndebates within feminism over its identity and self-image. Disagreements\namong feminist historians of philosophy over the value of canonical\nphilosophers, and the appropriate categories to use to interpret them,\nare, in the final analysis, the result of debate within feminist\nphilosophy over what feminism is, and what is theoretical commitments\nshould be, and what its core values are.\n4.\tFeminist Methodological Reflections on the History of Philosophy\n\n\nDisagreements over the value of the history of philosophy for feminist \ntheory has stimulated discussion concerning the methods and \npresuppositions of the study of the history of philosophy itself.  Can \nfeminists use the history of philosophy as a resource in the same way \nthat other philosophical movements have done?  This question, in turn, \ninspires us to reflect upon different reading strategies that we might \nemploy in relation to the history of philosophy.\n\n\nCynthia Freeland (2000) criticizes the idea that feminists can mine \nthe history of philosophy for useful ideas as other philosophical \nmovements and perspectives have done.  She argues that the feminist \nappropriation/inheritance approach to the history of philosophy is an \nideology.  Freeland defines an ideology as a theory or viewpoint that \nis politically oppressive and epistemically flawed.  Feminists who view \nthe philosophical canon as a resource to be mined for ideas useful to \nfeminism are engaged in a potentially oppressive activity since the \nhistory of philosophy is replete with ideas and theories that are (or \nmight be) oppressive of women today.   The epistemic flaw is that the \nappropriation approach is overly reverential of the tradition and might \ntherefore be insufficiently critical of it.  Deference is not an \nepistemic virtue. Freeland  points out that appropriators tend to use \nstandard criteria of historical interpretation like the principle of \ncharity that tries to find consistency in a philosopher's theories or \ndoctrines.  Following out this line of thought, it turns out that all \nstandard historians of philosophy might be guilty of this epistemic \ndefect since all of them use standard criteria of historical \ninterpretation.  The criticism cuts a wide swath since it requires \nfeminist historians of philosophy to deviate radically from the norms \nof their discipline since it turns out that the norms themselves might \npromote deference and oppression. What kind of feminist engagement with \nthe history of philosophy remains possible?\n\n\nSeveral reading strategies other than the standard have been advocated.  \nSome feminists advocate a radical departure from the norms of textual \ninterpretation by focusing, and drawing out the \u201cunthought\u201d of a text; \nits images and metaphors; its omissions and paradoxes. (Deutscher 1997)  Others \nemphasize the importance of questioning the line demarcating a text \nfrom its cultural, psychological or material context. (Schott 1997)  And yet others \nadvocate for an active philosophical engagement with a text rather \nthan the backward-looking activity of trying to determine the exact\nmeaning of a historical text. (LeDoeuff 1991)  These reading strategies, in turn, \nraise further issues concerning the limits of the history of philosophy\nand the criteria for adequate interpretation.",
