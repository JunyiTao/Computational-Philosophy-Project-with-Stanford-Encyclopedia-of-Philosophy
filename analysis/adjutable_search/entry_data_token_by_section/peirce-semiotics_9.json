    "main_text": "The Interim Account: 1903 || Objects\n3.2 Objects\n\nJust as Peirce thought signs could be classified according to whether\ntheir sign-vehicles function in virtue of qualities, existential\nfacts, or conventions and laws, he thought signs were similarly\nclassifiable according to how their object functioned in\nsignification. Recall that, for Peirce, objects\n\u201cdetermine\u201d their signs. That is to say, the nature of the\nobject constrains the nature of the sign in terms of what successful\nsignification requires. Again, Peirce thought the nature of these\nconstraints fell into three broad classes: qualitative, existential or\nphysical, and conventional and law-like. Further, if the constraints\nof successful signification require that the sign reflect qualitative\nfeatures of the object, then the sign is an icon. If the\nconstraints of successful signification require that the sign utilize\nsome existential or physical connection between it and its object,\nthen the sign is an index. And finally, if successful\nsignification of the object requires that the sign utilize some\nconvention, habit, or social rule or law that connects it with its\nobject, then the sign is a symbol.\n\nThis is a trichotomy with which we are already familiar from the early\naccount, and indeed, the examples of icons, indices, and symbols are\nlargely the same as before: icons are portraits and paintings, indices\nare natural and causal signs, symbols are words and so on. There are,\nhowever, additional instances, for example, icons include diagrams\nused in geometrical reasoning, indices include pointing fingers and\nproper names, and symbols including broad speech acts like assertion\nand judgment, all of which suggests a considerable broadening of this\ntrichotomy. It is well worth noting, though, that by 1903 Peirce was\naware that it would be hard, if not impossible, to find any pure\ninstances of icons and indices. Rather, he began to suspect that icons\nand indices were always partly symbolic or conventional. To try to\ncapture this, Peirce experimented with some additional terminology and\ntypes of icon and index. These he called the hypo-icon (see CP2 .276\n1903) and the sub-index (see CP 2.330 1903) respectively. We shall not\nexplore these signs further here (see (Goudge 1965) and (Atkin 2005)\nfor more on Peirce\u2019s view of indices, and (Legg 2008) for more on\nicons), but it is worth noting that by 1903, the simple\nicon/index/symbol trichotomy was something of an abstraction, and\nPeirce was aware that any single sign may display some combination of\niconic, indexical and symbolic characteristics.\n",
