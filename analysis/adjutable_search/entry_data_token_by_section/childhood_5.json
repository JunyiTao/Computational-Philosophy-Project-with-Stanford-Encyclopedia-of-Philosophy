    "main_text": "The Goods (and Bads?) of Childhood\n6. The Goods (and Bads?) of Childhood\n\n\u201cRefrigerator art,\u201d that is, the paintings and drawings of\nyoung children that parents display on the family\u2019s\nrefrigerator, is emblematic of adult ambivalence toward the\nproductions of childhood. Typically, parents are pleased with, and\nproud of, the art their children produce. But equally typically,\nparents do not consider the artwork of their children to be good\nwithout qualification. Yet, as Jonathan Fineberg has pointed out\n(Fineberg, 1997, 2006), several of the most celebrated artists of the\n20th century collected child art and were inspired by it. It may be\nthat children are more likely as children to produce art, the\naesthetic value of which a famous artist or an art historian can\nappreciate, than they will be able to later as adults.\n\nAccording to what we have called the \u201cAristotelian\nconception\u201d, childhood is an essentially prospective state. On\nsuch a view, the value of what a child produces cannot be expected to\nbe good in itself, but only good for helping the child to develop into\na good adult. Perhaps some child art is a counterexample to this\nexpectation. Of course, one could argue that adults who, as children,\nwere encouraged to produce art, as well as make music and excel at\ngames, are more likely to be flourishing adults than those who are not\nencouraged to give such \u201coutlets\u201d to their energy and\ncreativity. But the example of child art should at least make one\nsuspicious of Michael Slote\u2019s claim that \u201cjust as dreams\nare discounted except as they affect (the waking portions of) our\nlives, what happens in childhood principally affects our view of total\nlives through the effects that childhood success or failure are\nsupposed to have on mature individuals\u201d (Slote, 1983, 14).\n\nRecent philosophical work on the goods of childhood (Brennan 2014,\nGheaus 2014, Macleod 2010) stresses that childhood should not be\nevaluated solely insofar as it prepares the child to be a fully\nfunctioning adult. Instead, a good childhood is of intrinsic and not\nmerely instrumental value. Different childhoods that equally prepare\nchildren to be capable adults may be better or worse, depending on how\nchildren fare qua children. Goods potentially specific to childhood\n(or, more likely, of greatest importance during childhood) include\nopportunities for joyful and unstructured play and social\ninteractions, lack of significant responsibility, considerable free\ntime, and innocence, particularly sexual innocence. Play, for\ninstance, can be of considerable value not only as a means for\nchildren to acquire skills and capacities they will need as adults,\nbut also for itself, during childhood.\n\nEven more recently, some philosophers (Hannan 2018b, Hannan and Leland\n2018) have questioned whether there are features of childhood that\nmake childhood bad for children. Candidate bad-making features include\nchildren\u2019s impaired practical identity, their being\nasymmetrically physically and emotionally vulnerable to their parents\nand needing extensive control by them, and their lack of a fixed\npractical identity. Any evaluation of features that are particularly\nvaluable in childhood, and either uniquely or more easily accessed in\nchildhood, should be balanced against consideration of features that\nmake it a worse stage of life than adulthood. Bad-making features of\nchildhood may be traced either to aspects of childhood that cannot be\nchanged or to contingent social arrangements that may leave children\nvulnerable to abuse or neglect at the hands of their intimate\ncaregivers, without much opportunity for recourse.\n",
