    "main_text": "Psychology || Emotion\n2.6 Emotion\n\nLike \u201chabit\u201d, Dewey redescribed \u201cemotion\u201d as a\nbasic form of involvement present in \u201ccoordinated\ncircuits\u201d of activity. Where habits are controlled responses to\nproblematic situations, emotion, by contrast, is not predominantly\ncontrolled or organized; rather, it is an organism\u2019s resonance\nwith a situation, a \u201cperturbation from clash or failure of\nhabit\u201d (HNC, MW14: 54). As with the other aspects of\npsychological life, Dewey\u2019s account reconstructed emotion as\nfundamentally transactional with other experiences typically analyzed\nas discrete (the \u201crational\u201d or \u201cphysical\u201d\ndimensions, e.g.).\n\nDewey\u2019s account connected those of Charles Darwin and William\nJames. Darwin argued that internal emotional states cause organic\nexpressions which, depending on their survival value, may be subject\nto natural selection; for example, my feeling and expression of\nemotion may earn sympathy that aids survival of like-feeling\noffspring. James, in contrast, sought to decrease the distance between\nemotion and accompanying bodily expression. In actual cases of\nemotion, a perception excites a pre-organized physiological mechanism;\nour recognition of such changes just is the emotional\nexperience: \u201cwe feel sorry because we cry, angry\nbecause we strike\u201d (James 1890 [1981: 450]).\nDewey\u2019s \u201cThe Theory of Emotion\u201d (1894b & 1895,\nEW4) pressed James further, toward the integrated whole of\nfeeling-and-expression. Being sad is not merely feeling\nsad or acting sad but is the purposive organism\u2019s\noverall experience. This is Dewey\u2019s attempt to gently correct\nJames\u2019 unfortunate reiteration of mind-body dualism. To\nunderstand emotion, Dewey argued, we must see that \u201cthe mode of\nbehavior is the primary thing\u201d (\u201cThe Theory of\nEmotion\u201d, EW4: 174). As with habit, emotion is not the private\npossession of the subject, but rather emerges from the fluid boundary\nconnecting event and organism; emotion is \u201ccalled out by\nobjects, physical and personal\u201d, an intentional \u201cresponse\nto an objective situation\u201d (EN, LW1: 292). If I\nencounter a strange dog and I am perplexed as to how to react, there\nis an inhibition of habit, and this excites emotion. As I entertain a\nrange of incompatible responses (Run? Call out? Slink away?), a\ntension is created which further interrupts and inhibits habits, and\nis experienced as emotion (\u201cThe Theory of Emotion\u201d, EW4:\n182) Thus, emotions are intentional insofar as they are\n\u201cto or from or about something\nobjective, whether in fact or in idea\u201d and not merely reactions\n\u201cin the head\u201d (AE, LW10: 72).\n\nPhilosophically, emotion is a central feature of Dewey\u2019s\ncritique of traditional epistemology and metaphysics. He decried\ntraditional systems which, in their pursuit of rational access to\ntruth and reality, create an invidious distinction by casting emotion\nas confused thought, distraction, or bodily interference which needs\nto be suppressed, controlled, or bracketed. Emotion is intertwined,\npsychologically, both in the individual (in reasoning and acting), and\nin the wider culture (with social forms of meaning creation). Attempts\nto balkanize emotion are motivated in part, he argued, by the desire\nto segregate leisure from labor, men from women; on this reading, the\ntraditional rationalistic bent is, in effect, a power-play that\ndeserves intellectual and moral critique.\n",
