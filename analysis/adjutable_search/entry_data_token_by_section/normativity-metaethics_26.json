    "main_text": "Is Normativity Mind-Dependent? || Arguments for Mind-Dependence\n5.3 Arguments for Mind-Independence\n\nWe will consider two main arguments for the mind-independence of the\nnormative. First is a recent argument by David Enoch for the\nmind-independence of morality (2011: ch. 2). Enoch argues that when we\nare in certain kinds of interpersonal conflict with someone else, to\nthe extent that that conflict is due to preferences, or attitudes, or\ndesires (etc.), we should not stand our ground but should stand back\nfrom our own position and seek some sort of impartial, egalitarian\nsolution to the conflict. For example, if two friends want to do\nsomething fun, and one wants to go to the movies while the other wants\nto play video games, neither should insist on their position over the\nother\u2019s without budging. (Maybe they should flip a coin.) Enoch\ncalls this constraint \u201cImpartiality\u201d.\n\nYet, Enoch argues, this entails that on many mind-dependence theories,\nwe should find a way of compromising in the same way, when we have a\nmoral disagreement. This is easiest to see on the view that our moral\njudgments simply report mental states, which Enoch calls\n\u201cCaricatured Subjectivism\u201d. On Caricatured Subjectivism,\nour moral disagreements just are disagreements about mental\nstates, and so should be governed by Impartiality. Enoch argues that\nthe same result follows on any theory that grounds moral truth in\nmental states: on such views, we ought to find some way of\ncompromising when we have a moral disagreement.\n\nThis, Enoch argues, is a morally odious entailment: in many moral\ndisagreements, it is not only permissible but required that\nwe stand our ground. Imagine \u2013 to use Enoch\u2019s\ncase \u2013 disagreeing with someone about whether a dog\u2019s pain\ncounts, morally speaking. And imagine you then have to decide on a\nparticular case, for example, on whether to cause a dog serious pain,\nabout which you also disagree. Should you split the difference and\ncause just a small amount of pain, or flip a coin, or pursue some\nother compromise? No, Enoch argues: you should stand your ground. In\nthis way, moral disagreements are analogous to (non-moral) factual\ndisagreements and unlike conflicts of conative attitudes.\n\nEnoch\u2019s argument has its limitations, as he admits. His argument\nassumes that, on a given mind-dependence view, when two agents\ndisagree morally, their disagreement reduces to or is relevantly\nanalogous to a disagreement of conative attitudes. But if you have a\nview on which all moral agents necessarily share certain attitudes,\nthus entailing that certain moral truths are necessary, then all or at\nleast many moral disagreements will not be relevantly analogous to a\ndisagreement of conative attitudes. Hence mind-dependence views of\nthese kinds avoid Enoch\u2019s objection since his argument does not\nshow that disagreements, as understood by such theories, are governed\nby Impartiality. (Similarly, cultural relativism, \u201cno\npriority\u201d views, and any view which gives an irreducibly\nnormative constraint on which mental states can ground moral facts,\nalso avoid Enoch\u2019s objection, according to Enoch.)\n\nEnoch\u2019s argument also has the limitation that it only applies to\nmorality, rather than mind-dependence views of normativity in general.\nThis limitation appears on the face of the argument, since it relies\non the premise that it is morally objectionable not to stand\nour ground in some moral disagreements. It does not seem\nequally objectionable in any sense to compromise in cases of\nepistemic, or aesthetic, or prudential disagreements (though maybe the\ncase could be made in some or all of these domains).\n\nA second argument, or class of arguments, depends on what Sharon\nStreet (2009) calls ideally coherent eccentrics (ICEs):\ncharacters who have some intuitively bad motive (or desire, or belief,\netc.) that survives some idealization process. What process is\nrelevant will depend on the particular mind-dependence view under\nconsideration, but the idea is that some ICEs will survive any\nplausible idealization process. Generally, we can say that they have\nsome objectionable mental state that coheres both with their other\nrelevant mental states, and with the non-normative facts. The outcome,\nin abstract terms, is that for any given view of normativity\nV on which normative fact N for agent A is\nfully grounded in mental fact M, there is some ICE for whom\nM obtains, and thus N obtains for that ICE on\nV, but it is intuitively clear that N does\nnot obtain for that ICE. So we should reject V.\n\nThe strategy can be illustrated by a concrete example. Allan Gibbard\ntalks about the infamously cruel Roman emperor Caligula, and imagines\nthat he wants to torture for fun while harboring no conflicting\nattitudes (1990: 145). The argument is, then, that Caligula plainly\nwould be wrong to torture just for fun despite the fact that his\ndesire to torture for fun is coherent with his other attitudes and\nresistant to change under any idealization process. So the wrongness\nof his torturing for fun is not grounded in his actual attitudes nor\nis it grounded in the attitudes of his that would survive some\nidealization process.\n\nThe argument from ICEs has some shortcomings. First, it seems only to\nstrike against theories according to which specific moral facts\nconcerning specific agents are grounded in the attitudes or idealized\nattitudes of those agents. Second, recall that, for reasons we\nexplained before, we take the debate about mind-dependence to concern\nwhether normative principles are fully metaphysically\ngrounded in mental facts. The example of Caligula, and similar\nexamples found in Parfit (2011: ch 2, sec 11), Williams (1989 [1995:\n39]) and Hume (1739\u201340: Book 2, Part 3), are not on point, for\nthey all concern an agent with a specific mental profile and a\nspecific moral claim involving that agent. The interesting question is\nwhether we can use the basic idea of ICEs to develop analogous\nobjections to views that fully ground normative principles in mental\nfacts.\n\nMind-dependence theories differ from one another in various ways. Yet\nthe ICE strategy can perhaps be modified in ways that would allow it\nto strike against a wider variety of mind-dependence theories, and\nperhaps against all such theories. For example, ICE strategy is on its\nface not aimed at views like cultural relativism, which would\nnevertheless still count as a mind-dependence view on our definition.\nBut we can easily conceive of ICE-analogues at the cultural level:\nassume the relevant relativistic view is that moral facts for\nA are grounded what A\u2019s culture believes. We\ncan imagine A\u2019s culture believing, without internal\ninconsistency, that genocide is morally commendable \u2013 but it\nclearly is not. Again, the ideally coherent Caligula wants to torture\nfor fun and has no conflicting desires. This will entail that he has a\ndecisive reason to torture for fun on the view that decisive reasons\nare grounded in desires (at least when those desires don\u2019t\nconflict with any others). Or take the view that believing one has\na reason to X engenders a reason for one to X.\nWe can then imagine that Caligula believes he has a reason to torture\nfor fun. Combining this particular mind-dependence view with the\nmodified Caligula example entails that Caligula has a reason to\ntorture for fun. Nothing seems to suggest that any particular\nmind-dependence view is going to escape criticism. And,\nmind-independence proponents will argue, the only way we can account\nfor the facts that Caligula is wrong to torture for fun and lacks a\ndecisive reason to torture for fun is by allowing that some normative\nfacts are fully mind-independent.\n\nIt is open to any given mind-dependence theory to argue that it does\nnot have the morally objectionable entailment suggested in\nthe ICE argument. Perhaps the theory could argue that it\u2019s\nimpossible for the relevant mental state not to be in conflict with\nother relevant mental states, or the non-normative facts \u2013 maybe,\nthat is, it is impossible for the ideally coherent eccentric\nin question to exist. On the other hand, mind-dependence theorists\ncould argue, as Sharon Street (2009) does, that the ICE could exist,\nand that the relevant normative entailments do obtain \u2013 but that\nthey are not problematic. That is, for instance, perhaps the ideal\nCaligula really does have a reason to torture for fun\n\nMind-dependence theorists could try to take the edge off these\nentailments. Taking the case of reasons as an example, they could\nargue, as Williams (1989 [1995: 39]) suggested, that even though, on\nWilliams\u2019s theory, a cruel husband might have no reason to be\nnicer to his wife, we can still say that he is \u201cungrateful,\ninconsiderate, hard, sexist, nasty, selfish, brutal, and many other\ndisadvantageous things\u201d. Of course, this strategy depends on\neach of those properties not entailing that someone with that\nproperty has a reason to try to avoid it. This is tenuous at best: it\nseems doubtful at the very least to say that we have no reason to\navoid being ungrateful or sexist, etc.\n\nThe mind-dependence theorist can also consistently say that, even if\nthe ICE lacks the reasons in question, we can nevertheless force him\ninto therapy, or help his wife leave him, or try to have him arrested\n(Manne 2014). These actions don\u2019t require that the cruel husband\nhave any reasons whatsoever, but depend only on what the sympathetic\nonlooker or the wife has reason to do. But some will still find this\nunsatisfying: the husband shouldn\u2019t be acting the way\nhe is. And, of course, here the mind-independence theorist is happy to\nadvertise the benefit she can offer: the husband has a reason to treat\nhis wife better no matter what\u2019s going on in his head (or his\nheart).\n",
