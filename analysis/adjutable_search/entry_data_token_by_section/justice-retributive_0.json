    "main_text": "The Appeal of Retributive Justice\n1. The Appeal of Retributive Justice\n\nThe appeal of retributive justice as a theory of punishment rests in\npart on direct intuitive support, in part on the claim that it\nprovides a better account of when punishment is justifiable than\nalternative accounts of punishment, and in part on arguments tying it\nto deeper moral principles.\n\nMany share the intuition that those who commit wrongful acts,\nespecially serious crimes, should be punished even if punishing them\nwould produce no other good. Consider, for example, being the\nsentencing judge for a rapist who was just convicted in your court.\nSuppose that he has since suffered an illness that has left him\nphysically incapacitated so that he cannot rape again, and that he has\nenough money to support himself without resorting to criminal\nactivities. Suppose that this suffices to ensure that there is no need\nto deter or incapacitate him to prevent him from committing serious\ncrimes in the future. Suppose, in addition, that you could sentence\nhim to spend his days on a tropical island where he has always wanted\nto go, and where he will spend most of his days relaxing and pursuing\nhis interests. You can, however, impose one condition on his time\nthere: he must regularly report to a prison to be filmed in prison\ngarb, and these videos will be posted online, sending the message that\nhe is serving hard time for his crimes. As long as this ruse is secure\nfrom discovery, it could meaningfully contribute to general\ndeterrence. But even if the goods normally cited by consequentialists\nto justify punishment\u2014incapacitation and deterrence\u2014are\nachieved, is that the sentence he should receive? Many share the\nintuition that there is still some reason to want him to be punished\nmore harshly (see Moore 1997: 98\u2013101).\n\nNot only is retributivism in that way intuitively appealing, the\nprimary alternative, consequentialist theories of punishment that\nfocus on deterrence and incapacitation, seem to confront a deep\nproblem. They have difficulty explaining a core and intuitively\ncompelling feature of retributivism, namely the widely shared sense\nthat it is always or nearly always impermissible both to inflict\npunishment on those who have done no wrong and to inflict\ndisproportionately large punishments on those who have done some\nwrong. (Some respond to this point by adopting a mixed theory,\naccording to which retributivism provides a necessary condition for\npunishment, but consequentialist considerations provide the reasons to\npunish. For more on such an approach see\n section 3.3.)\n\nBoth of these sources of retributivism\u2019s appeal have clear\nlimits. The direct intuition can be challenged with the claim that it\nis merely the reflection of a morally dubious psychological propensity\nto feel an excess of what Nietzsche, in the Genealogy of\nMorals, called ressentiment,\n\n\na witches\u2019 brew [of] resentment, fear, anger, cowardice,\nhostility, aggression, cruelty, sadism, envy, jealousy, guilt,\nself-loathing, hypocrisy and self-deception. (Moore 1997: 120)\n\n\nAnd the argument that retributivism justifies punishment better than\nconsequentialism presupposes that punishment is justifiable (for\ncriticism of this premise, see Golash 2005; Boonin 2008), and that\nthere are no alternatives that are better than both (for three\nalternatives, see Quinn 1985; Tadros 2011; Lacey & Pickard\n2015a).\n\nTo respond to these challenges, retributive justice must ultimately be\njustified in a larger moral context that shows that it is plausibly\ngrounded in, or at least connected to, other, deeply held moral\nprinciples. Only in this way should its intuitive appeal be regarded,\nin reflective equilibrium, as morally sound. For a discussion of the\nprospects for deeper justification, see\n section 5.\n",
