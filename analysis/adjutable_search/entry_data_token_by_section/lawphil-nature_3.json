    "main_text": "The Methodology of Jurisprudence || The Target of a Theory of Law\n2.1 The Target of a Theory of Law\n\n\nThe first important class of methodological questions in\njurisprudence concerns the target of first-order theories of\nlaw\u2014that is, what phenomenon such theories aim to provide an\naccount of. In taking a stand on what the proper target of a\nfirst-order legal theory is, one incurs a number of other\nmethodological commitments. These include adopting a view about when\nsuch theories are successful, taking a stand on what sort of data such\ntheories aim to systematize and explain, and determining what sorts of\narguments are legitimately used in deciding between one of these\ntheories and its competitors.\n\n\nThere are five main families of views on this question. One view takes\njurisprudence to be a form of conceptual analysis, which is to say\nthat theories of law aim to provide an account of some concept of\nlaw. This approach is often associated with Hart\u2019s influential\nwork, The Concept of Law (1994). A second sort of view adopts\na more skeptical stance towards the methodology of conceptual analysis\nand takes theories of law to be in the business of offering a\nreductive explanation of law itself, not some concept of it. Another\nrecent view sees general jurisprudence as just another branch of\nmetanormative inquiry, which renders it continuous with other\nphilosophical fields like metaethics. Fourth, the prescriptive view\ntakes it that the aim of a theory of law is to specify the notion of\nlaw that it would be most desirable for us to adopt. A fifth kind of\nview, associated with Dworkin\u2019s work, takes it that legal\ntheories are in the business of offering a constructive interpretation\nof legal practice. In what follows, each of these five views, as well\nas some of the main issues they face, will be discussed in more\ndepth.\n2.1.1 Conceptual Analysis Views\n\n\nOn conceptual analysis views, theories of law aim to capture the\nconcept of law and they succeed to the extent that they provide a\ncoherent account of the relevant data about that concept and related\nconcepts. In particular, the data to be systematized are taken to be\npeople\u2019s intuitions involving some shared concept of law (or\ncognate concepts like legal validity or legal obligation). In their\nsimplest form, such intuitions can be thought of as judgments about\nwhether the relevant concept does or does not apply to particular\ncases. Accordingly, on this sort of view, a theory of law aims to\nprovide an account of the conditions under which the target concept of\nlaw (or one of its cognates) applies.\n \n\nWhat\u2019s more, such a theory can be arrived at by employing\nthe method of conceptual analysis, undertaken from the proverbial\narmchair. The idea is that the theorist starts with a putative set of\ncriteria for the correct application of the target concept, and then\nshe tests this account against her intuitions about that concept. If\nthe account entails that the concept applies to particular cases that\nit intuitively does not apply to, then this provides reason to reject\nor revise the account in question. By contrast, if the account entails\nthat the target concept applies to certain cases and this is the\nintuitively correct result, this tends to provide affirmative support\nfor the account. The account successfully captures the target concept\nto the extent that it yields intuitively correct results about\nparticular cases, and does so in an explanatorily satisfying way (as\nopposed to an ad hoc manner). (For a more in depth discussion of the\nmethodology of conceptual analysis as applied to the concept of law,\nsee Shapiro 2011, 16\u201322.)\n\n\nJurisprudence has been influenced by two main ways of understanding\nthe relevant intuitions (or data) that theories of law aim to\nsystematize. This, in turn, is due to the fact that one might\nunderstand concepts themselves, and our intuitions about them, in two\ndifferent ways. Accordingly, we find two main varieties of the\nconceptual analysis view of methodology.\n\n\nThe first understanding of concepts takes concept possession to be\nmainly a matter of linguistic competence. That is, to possess the\nconcept of law is to know when the word \u201claw\u201d as used in\nits juridical sense (not the scientific sense) applies. Thus,\nintuitions about the concept of law are to be understood as linguistic\nintuitions about how to use the word \u201claw.\u201d On the present\nview, then, conceptual analysis is a mode of linguistic analysis. This\nsort of view was famously discussed in chapters 1 and 2 of\nDworkin\u2019s Law\u2019s Empire (Dworkin 1986, 32,\n43\u201346). It arguably traces back to the kind of ordinary language\nphilosophy associated with J.L. Austin and Gilbert Ryle (Marmor 2013,\n210\u2013212).\n\n\nHowever, this understanding of concept possession has\ndrawbacks. Perhaps the biggest source of concern in the present\ncontext is that this sort of view fuels a version of Dworkin\u2019s\n\u201csemantic sting\u201d argument (Dworkin 1986, 43\u201346). The\nargument may be summarized as follows. Suppose legal theories aim to\ncapture the concept of law and that concept possession just is a\nmatter of knowing when the word \u201claw\u201d applies. If so, the\nargument runs, legal theories cannot explain disagreement about the\ngrounds of law, that is, about the conditions of legal validity. After\nall, if legal theories are in this way semantic in nature, then\ndisagreement about what the grounds of law are must boil down to\ndisagreement about when the word \u201claw\u201d applies\u2014at\nleast assuming the parties to the disagreement are not merely talking\npast one another. But now a dilemma arises. Either legal practitioners\npossess the same concept of law or they do not. If they do possess the\nsame concept, then it seems they cannot fail to agree about\nwhat it takes for a norm to count as law. After all, they all know\nwhen the word expressing their shared concept of law applies. But this\nis implausible, since legal practice in fact is rife with disagreement\nabout what the grounds of law are (and thus, what counts as law or as\nlegal). On the other hand, if legal practitioners do not\nshare the same concept of law, then their disagreement about what the\ngrounds of law are must just be due to the fact that they are talking\npast one another. But that, too, is implausible. Legal practice, as\nDworkin puts it, is not \u201ca grotesque joke\u201d (Dworkin 1986,\n44). Accordingly, there must be something wrong with construing legal\ntheories as mere semantic accounts of when the word \u201claw\u201d\napplies.\n\n\nIf, in light of this argument, we are to abandon the idea that\nfirst-order legal theories are semantic theories, there are two obvious\nways to proceed. First, one might simply abandon the idea that legal\ntheories are exercises in conceptual analysis. This was Dworkin\u2019s\npreferred response, though, as we\u2019ll see, one can reject\nconceptual analysis without adopting Dworkin\u2019s own favored\nmethodology. (More on that in sub-section 2.1.2.) Second, if one wants to\nstill say that legal theories are in the business of analyzing the\nconcept of law, then the obvious response to the semantic sting\nargument is to deny that concept possession just is a matter of knowing\nhow the word \u201claw\u201d in its juridical sense is to be applied.\nThis suggests a second, richer form of conceptual analysis that legal\ntheorists might be engaged in.\n\n\nThe basic idea behind the richer view is to take it that concept\npossession, rather than merely being a matter of knowing when words\napply, involves something meatier: namely, the possession of a wide\nrange of substantive beliefs or intuitions about the concept, its\nessential features and its proper application. The assumption is that\nthe intuitions one is disposed to have in virtue of possessing the\nconcept of law will be fertile enough to constitute a particular\nsubstantive conception of what the law is and how it functions. The aim\nof a theory of law, then, would be to systematize these pre-theoretic\njudgments about the concept of law in order to provide an account of\nsome substantive conception of law. (This sort of richer view of\nconcept possession is discussed, e.g., in Raz 2004, 4\u20137;\nStravopoulos 2012, 78\u201379; Shapiro 2011, 16\u201322. It is perhaps also the\nsort of view presupposed by Hart.) On this view, legal disagreement\nremains possible because while practitioners might all be using the\nsame concept of law, the richness of the concept allows that they\nnonetheless might not possess the concept determinately enough, or\nunderstand its application conditions thoroughly enough, to guarantee\nconsensus on theoretical questions about what the grounds of law\nactually are.\n\n\nHowever, also this richer understanding of concept possession, and the\nmeatier picture of conceptual analysis it gives rise to, has been\nwidely criticized (Marmor 2013, 215\u2013217; Raz 2004, 10; Leiter\n2007, 177\u201379). One question that immediately arises is\nwhich concept of law, exactly, constitutes the proper target\nof a theory of law. Is it the concept of law that is possessed by the\nlegal practitioners in a particular jurisdiction? Or is it some\nuniversally shared concept of law? Worries loom either way. If a legal\ntheory only aims to capture the concept of law employed in a\nparticular jurisdiction, then that would render the theory parochial\nand it might lose its interest for those who are not concerned with\nthat particular jurisdiction. On the other hand, one might doubt that\nthere really is a universally shared concept of law that is employed\nby practitioners in all jurisdictions\u2014or if there is one, it is\ndoubtful that it is anything more than the sort of thin concept that\none possesses in virtue of knowing what the word \u201claw\u201d in\nits juridical sense means.\n\n\nA deeper worry about all forms of conceptual analysis is the\nquestion of why we should care about anybody\u2019s concept\nof law in the first place (Marmor 2013, 216\u2013217; Leiter 2007, 177\u201379).\nAfter all, as philosophers, it seems that it is the nature of law\nitself that we care about understanding (Raz 2004, 7, 10).\nGranted, there are interesting sociological questions to be asked about\nwhat various groups of people believe to be the case about how law\nfunctions. But it is not obvious that there is anything distinctively\nphilosophical about such questions. Insofar as philosophers (qua\nphilosophers) are interested in what people believe about a given\nconcept, this would be because understanding people\u2019s beliefs\nabout the concept is a route to understanding that which it is a\nconcept of (Raz 2004, 4, 10). Accordingly, one might think\nthat what theories of law aim to capture is not anybody\u2019s concept\nof law in particular, but rather the nature of law itself. (See also\nthe entry\n on\n concepts, section 5.2.)\n\n \n\nA possible response to this objection is to assert that since law\nis a social phenomenon and is in part constituted by\npractitioners\u2019 own understanding of the practice they are\nengaged in, collecting evidence about the concept of law possessed by\nlegal practitioners is an especially useful way to investigate law\nitself (Stravopoulos 2012, 79). Still, one might wonder whether this\nroute to investigating the nature of law itself would be the most\neffective strategy to employ, given its indirectness. Why limit\nourselves to asking questions about concepts if law can be studied\ndirectly?\n\n\nA very different response would be to adopt a Platonist account of\nconcepts, according to which they are not mental representations at\nall, but rather abstract objects akin to the objects of mathematical\ninquiry. The concept of law, then, would be the abstract object one\nmust grasp in order to think about law. Accordingly, it is this\nabstract object\u2014the concept of law\u2014that\nphilosophers care about and aim to investigate using the method of\nconceptual analysis (cf. Bealer 1998). Nonetheless, this view\nof concepts faces familiar objections. For one, an account is needed of\nhow we can have access to the concept of law, conceived of as an\nindependently existing abstract object. Moreover, even if we can access\nit, a puzzle arises about how different people who all determinately\ngrasp the concept of law could possibly end up disagreeing\nabout its nature (Sarch 2010, 468\u201373). Finally, while it might be\nplausible that a priori disciplines like mathematics and logic\n aim to investigate abstract objects (see the entry on\n platonism in the philosophy of mathematics),\n it is not\nclear that the investigation of a social phenomenon like the law, which\nis heavily dependent on human beliefs, attitudes and behavior, can be\nunderstood analogously. While mathematicians might be investigating the\nnature of abstract objects like numbers or sets, it seems more doubtful\nthat legal philosophers are investigating the abstract object\nlaw.\n2.1.2 Investigating Law Itself\n\n\nGiven the above doubts about conceptual analysis, several views have\nbeen suggested according to which first-order legal theories are\nprimarily in the business of describing and explaining the nature of\nlaw itself, not any concept of it. Reductionist and\nnaturalistic views fall into this category. (As noted below, such views\nneed not completely eschew the armchair methods just sketched, but to\nthe extent these methods remain viable, a very different explanation of\ntheir defensibility would have to be given.)\n\n\nIn particular, reductionist views take it that illuminating the\nnature of law is a matter of explaining what the law is, and how it\noperates, in terms of more foundational facts. As a result, first-order\ntheories of law succeed to the extent that they accomplish this in an\nexplanatorily powerful way (Marmor 2013). The goal of a first-order\ntheory, on this sort of view, is to offer a metaphysical\nreduction of law: that is, to show that the phenomenon of law is\nactually constituted by, and fully reducible to, some other more\nfoundational type of phenomenon (in the way that chemistry could in\nprinciple be reduced to particle physics). Thus construed, positivism,\nfor example, would seek to explain the nature of law by reducing facts\nabout what the law is, how it functions and what it requires, to more\nfoundational social facts\u2014e.g., about\npeople\u2019s behavior, beliefs and dispositions. By providing a\nreduction of this kind, a theory like positivism purports to illuminate\nthe phenomenon of law itself by breaking it down into its constituents\nand explaining how they together make up the complex social practice\nthat is the law. (For more on metaphysical reduction in general, see\n Schroeder 2007, 61\u201383; see also the entry on\n scientific reduction.)\n\n \n\nOne well-known type of reductionist view is naturalized\njurisprudence. Brian Leiter has been the most prominent defender of\nthis position (Leiter 2007). Like other reductionist views,\nnaturalized jurisprudence takes the aim of legal theories to be to\nexplain the nature of law itself (not anybody\u2019s concept of\nit). But what is characteristic of naturalized jurisprudence is that\nit also insists that a purely empirical methodology should be used in\n doing so (Leiter 2007, 180\u201381, 183\u201399). (See also the entry\n on\n naturalism in legal philosophy.)\n\n\n\nNaturalists might part company with adherents of other reductionist\nviews over whether or not the armchair methods of philosophers, and\nrelated appeals to intuitions, thought experiments and the like, are\nmisguided. The naturalist is likely to reject this mode of inquiry,\nwhile other reductionists may be more amenable to using it. A\nreductionist could in principle defend this sort of inquiry, for\ninstance, by claiming that our particular-case intuitions involve a\nconcept that we have acquired from experience with legal practice, and\nso such intuitions can be one useful source of information about the\nnature of law itself. Moreover, if legal practice (as a social\nphenomenon) is partially constituted by practitioners\u2019 own\nbeliefs and attitudes towards the practice they are engaged in, then\nevidence about legal practitioners\u2019 concept of law might prove\nespecially relevant as evidence about the law itself (Stravopoulos\n2012, 79).\n \n\nBy contrast, naturalists tend not to endorse the armchair method\nof testing theories of law against intuition, given their aim of\nmaking \u201cphilosophical theorizing continuous with and dependent\nupon scientific theorizing\u201d (Leiter 2007, 35). Leiter argues\nthat our intuitions about law are too unreliable to be afforded much\nepistemic weight (as others have argued with respect to intuitions in\nother areas of philosophy) (Leiter 2007, 180, 184; cf. Cummins\n1998). On Leiter\u2019s view, philosophers generally should aim to\nunpack the \u201cconcepts that have been vindicated by their role in\nsuccessful explanation and prediction of empirical phenomena\u201d\n(Leiter 2007, 184). Thus, he suggests a methodology that \u201ctak[es]\nseriously the\u2026social scientific literature on law\u2026to see\nwhat concept of law figures in the most powerful explanatory and\npredictive models of legal phenomena such as judicial behavior\u201d\n(Leiter 2007, 184). This methodological view, however, raises\nquestions about why the legal philosopher should study only judicial\nbehavior and not something else. More generally, the naturalist owes\nan account of what features of law are most in need of explication and\nwhy.\n\n\nA different sort of concern that arises for reductionist views (and\nperhaps naturalistic views as well) is that it may pose particular\nproblems for positivism. Specifically, if law is a normative phenomenon\nthat gives rise to legal obligations, one might worry that it is not\npossible to reduce legal facts (i.e., facts about what our\nlegal obligations are) to a set of purely non-normative facts,\ne.g., social ones. One might think that this would\nimpermissibly transgress the familiar (though not uncontroversial)\nis-ought gap. (For a discussion of this sort of worry about positivism,\nsee Shapiro 2011, 47\u201349.)\n\n\nIn response, one route that positivists who want to be reductionists\ncould take is to maintain that legal facts really are descriptive in\nnature, not genuinely normative. In particular, such positivists might\nclaim that facts about what legal obligations we have simply are\ndescriptive facts about what the law holds that we ought to\ndo\u2014not normative facts about what we really ought to do (Shapiro\n2011, 188; see also Hart 1994, 110).\n2.1.3 The Metanormative Inquiry View\n\nAnother recent methodological view developed by Plunkett and Shapiro\n(2017) takes general jurisprudence to be just another branch of\nmetanormative inquiry. The latter kind of inquiry as a general matter\naims to explain how normative thought, talk, and entities (if any) fit\ninto reality. Metaethics is another branch of metanormative inquiry,\nwhich focuses on how ethical thought, talk and entities fit into\nreality. Thus, on the present view the subject of inquiry in general\njurisprudence would be legal thought, talk and entities (if\nany), and the aim of the field would be to explain how such thought\nand talk about law\u2014as well as legal structures and legal\nproperties (if any)\u2014are best accounted for in one\u2019s general\nphilosophical view of reality. On this view, jurisprudential inquiry\nwould be continuous with\u2014and methodologically quite\nsimilar\u2014to the work done in other areas of normative inquiry,\nespecially ethics and aesthetics.\n\n \nOne question that arises for this position, however, concerns the\nextent to which this is a distinct methodology from those discussed\nabove. If the focus of one\u2019s metanormative inquiry is legal thought\nand talk, we seem to get rather close to the conceptual analysis\npicture of how jurisprudence should proceed. On the other hand, if the\nfocus of inquiry emphasizes how legal entities or properties fit into\nreality in general, then the view ends up seeming rather close to the\nnaturalist position that the topic of jurisprudential inquiry is\nphenomenon of law itself. Nonetheless, perhaps a particular attraction\nof the metanormative view is that it can show how both the conceptual\nanalysis picture and the naturalist picture capture distinct pieces of\nthe bigger enterprise of the task that jurisprudence is engaged\nin. Thus, rather than purporting to replace the other methodologies\ndiscussed above, the metanormative view, if sound, would do away with\nthere being a privileged starting point for jurisprudential inquiry\n(such as metaphysics of legal content, the semantic analysis of legal\nstatements, or the nature of legal obligations).\n2.1.4 The Prescriptive View\n\n\nA different sort of approach to methodology in jurisprudence takes\nit that the proper aim of a legal theory is to specify a substantive\nconception of law that it would be especially desirable for\npeople to adopt. Moreover, even if the conception of law that this\ninquiry ends up supporting departs radically from our pre-theoretical\nunderstanding of law, then the resulting theory would recommend\nabandoning that prior understanding of law. Accordingly, if\njurisprudence is chiefly a prescriptive endeavor, then theories of law\nmight end up being radically revisionist in nature (though, of course,\nnot necessarily).\n\n\nAs explained in the next sub-section, Dworkin\u2019s methodological\nview incorporates some prescriptive elements. But one prominent\nadvocate of an exclusively prescriptive project is Neil MacCormick\n(MacCormick 1985; see also Campbell 1996; Murphy 2001; Postema 1989;\nSchauer 1996; Waldron 2001). MacCormick argues that there are\ncompelling normative arguments in favor of adopting a positivist\nconception of law. In particular, he suggests that values like\nautonomy and freedom of conscience demand that the law not regulate\nwith a heavy hand \u201cthe sphere of aspirational values, of duties\nof self-respect and of duties of love,\u201d a sphere that concerns\n\u201cquesting for the good beyond duty, or for the right lines of\ndevelopment of a self, or for the proper regard to bestow upon\none\u2019s family, friends or neighbors\u201d (MacCormick 1985,\n35\u201336). Values like autonomy and freedom of conscience,\nMcCormack thinks, support the claim that at least within this sphere\nof conduct, it is desirable to keep the question of what the law\nrequires entirely separate from the question of what morality\nrequires. (However, MacCormick also allows that the law properly can\nregulate the sphere of \u201cduties of justice,\u201d as these\nduties are in some sense weightier (MacCormick 1985, 35).)\nAccordingly, at least in some spheres of conduct, the question of what\nthe law is ought to be held distinct from the question of\nwhat morality requires. Thus, MacCormick seems to be offering a\nnormative argument for a claim that has often been associated with\npositivism, namely a version of the Separation Thesis. (Though, as\nseen earlier, it is not clear that all positivists must be committed\nto a strong version of this thesis.)\n\n\nWhile the question of what conception of law it is most desirable\nthat people adopt is surely a significant one, it is important to note\nthat the prescriptive view of methodology in jurisprudence is not\ngenuinely in competition with either the conceptual analysis view or\nthe reductionist approach. After all, it might turn out, for\nexample, that positivism provides the best account of our concept of\nlaw, or perhaps is the best reductive account of the phenomenon of law\nitself, even though there are compelling normative arguments for\nchanging the practice or adopting a new concept of it that, say,\ncomports with natural law theory. Accordingly, accounts of the concept\nof law, or reductive theories of law, are not necessarily inconsistent\nwith prescriptive accounts of what legal theory it would be most\ndesirable from the moral point of view to adopt.\n2.1.5 Constructive Interpretation of Legal Practice\n\n\nA final methodological view, which deserves separate treatment both\nbecause of its influence and sophistication, is Dworkin\u2019s\n(Dworkin 1986). This view takes it that (i) the target of a first-order\ntheory of law is existing legal practice and (ii) these\ntheories succeed to the extent that they offer a defensible\nconstructive interpretation (in Dworkin\u2019s sense) of that\npractice. According to the constructive interpretation view, the aim\nof a first-order theory of law is not to analyze any concept or to\nreduce legal facts to other more foundational facts. Rather, the aim\nof a legal theory is to reconstruct the behavior and\nself-understandings of participants in legal practice and, moreover,\nto do so in a way that casts this practice in its best moral light. As\na result, a theory of law is more successful the better it both fits\nwith the data about how legal practitioners understand the practice\nthey are engaged in, while also normatively justifying that\npractice (Dworkin 1986; Perry 1995, 129\u201331; see also the entry\n on\n legal interpretivism).\n\n\n\nOne concern about the constructive interpretation view of\nmethodology in jurisprudence is that it may not be in genuine\ncompetition with either the conceptual analysis or reductive views of\nmethodology. After all, one sort of project is to explain what law\nactually is and how it operates (perhaps according to our concept of\nit). But it is a very different sort of project to explain how we\nshould conceive of the law in order for legal practice to be\nnormatively justified. It seems possible that our account of what law\nactually is tells us one thing (e.g., that certain features of\nit are essential and others not), while our account of what law should\nbe like in order for the practice to be as justified as possible tells\nus to think of law in a rather different way (e.g., as having\ndifferent essential features). Accordingly, some have argued that the\nconstructive interpretation view engages with the other methodological\nviews mentioned above only if it denies what they assert: viz.,\nthat legal theories attempt to provide an explanation (perhaps of some\nparticular kind\u2014e.g., reductive) of the actual nature of\nlaw (or perhaps our concept of it).\n\n\nOne way that adherents of the constructive interpretation view might\ndeny what certain other methodological views assert is by denying that\nit is even possible to give a reductive explanation of law.\n(For discussion, see Marmor 2013, 218.) The thought would be to claim that law is a\nnormative practice, and normative facts cannot be reduced to purely\nnon-normative facts without losing something essential. In response,\nthe reductionist might either deny that legal facts are genuinely\nnormative (in which case the sought-after reduction would be\nunproblematic), or she might assert that any successful reduction will\nhave to reduce legal facts to a set of facts that includes\nnormative facts (in which case a version of natural law theory might\nappear attractive).\n2.2 Is Legal Theory Inherently Evaluative?\n\n\nA second widely-discussed question about jurisprudential methodology\nis whether first-order legal theories are inherently evaluative. The\nabove views about the proper target of first-order theories of law have\ndifferent implications about this second question. But before\nexplaining that, we must first get the relevant question more clearly\nin view.\n2.2.1 Preliminaries\n\n\nTo begin with, one might wonder where the interest in the question\nof whether legal theory is inherently evaluative comes from. Some of\nthis interest likely traces to the skeptical worry that legal theories\npurporting to be purely descriptive in fact are pushing some hidden\nideological or political agenda. (For more on this, see, e.g.,\nJohn Gardner\u2019s introduction to Dickson 2004.) A second source of\nthe interest in this question may be the suspicion (or hope) that if\nlegal theory proves to be inherently evaluative, that would be an\nindependent reason to adopt some version of natural law theory. Whether\nthis is so remains doubtful, however, since meta-questions about the\nmethodology of legal theory prima facie seem to be independent\nof questions in first-order legal theory like what the determinants of\nthe content of law are. What is more, legal scholars might be drawn to\nthe present issue through consideration of Dworkin\u2019s argument\nthat there is a very tight connection between the evaluative nature of\ntheorizing about the law and the evaluative nature of law itself,\nrendering the content of law inevitably dependent, at least in part, on\nmoral-political considerations. Regardless of the motivations for\nengaging in the debate about whether legal theory is inherently\nevaluative, however, this debate has taken on independent significance\nand has been a fruitful source of insight in its own right.\n\n\nTo avoid confusion, the question we are concerned with here must be\nclarified in several ways. For there are a number of\nuncontroversial ways in which legal theory plausibly is or\nmight be evaluative, and these do not go to the heart of the\nmethodological debates in jurisprudence.\n\n\nFirst, there are several trivial ways in which legal theory, like\ntheories about any topic, plausibly cannot be entirely\nvalue-free. In particular, it seems that one cannot engage in the\nbusiness of theorizing about law without evaluating the extent to which\nvarious theories are coherent, simple, clear, elegant, comprehensive,\nand so on (Dickson 2004, 32\u201333). Granted this means that legal\ntheorists must engage in a form of evaluation. But there is nothing\nspecial about legal theory in this regard. After all, these\nmeta-theoretical virtues are criteria for the success of theories about\nany subject matter.\n \n\nA second seemingly uncontroversial way in which legal theory is\nevaluative is that one cannot begin to develop a theory of law without\ndetermining which of its central features are to be accounted for\n(Dickson 2001, 38\u201345). John Finnis, for example, argues that one\ncannot do first-order legal theory without taking a stand on what the\nimportant features of law are that adequate theories must explain\n(e.g., the law\u2019s claim to authority). However, this seems to\nrequire evaluation (Finnis 1980, 9\u201315).\n\n\nNonetheless, it is not likely to be especially controversial that\nlegal theory is evaluative in this way. To see why, distinguish\nbetween (a) thick evaluative claims, which predicate some\nkind of moral goodness, or perhaps all-things-considered value, of an\nitem and (b) thin evaluative claims, which do not. (This\ndistinction roughly tracks Julie Dickson\u2019s distinction between\ndirectly evaluative propositions and indirectly evaluative\npropositions. See Dickson 2001, 51\u201355.) Thus, the simplest thick\nevaluative claims have the form: \\(X\\) is morally\n[all-things-considered] good [bad]. Such claims might also be\ncomparative in nature, such that they have the form: \\(X\\) is\nmorally [all-things-considered] better [worse] than \\(Y\\). By\ncontrast, thin evaluative claims judge how well some item fares\nrelative to a standard that is neither moral nor all-things-considered\nnormative. Such claims do not entail any thick evaluative claims\neither. Examples of thin evaluative claims thus would include\n\u201c\\(X\\) is important\u201d and \u201c\\(X\\) is\ninteresting\u201d. Accordingly, even if legal theorists must make\nthin evaluative claims in order to be able to begin the project of\ndeveloping a first-order legal theory, this does not mean that they\nmust make thick evaluative claims in order to do so. After all, one\nmight construct a theory that captures a range of legal phenomena that\nare deemed central or important, while still remaining agnostic about\nwhether these phenomena are themselves valuable.\n\n\nA third way in which legal theory could in principle be evaluative,\nthough uncontroversially so, is suggested by the prescriptive view\ndiscussed in section 2.1.3. If the job of a first-order theory of law is\nto identify the concept of law it would be most desirable for us to\nemploy, then there is a sense in which the resulting theory of law\nwould of course be evaluative. Nonetheless, as seen above, prescriptive\ntheories aim to answer a different question from theories in the\nconceptual analysis, reductive or interpretive categories. Thus, what\nmatters to the debate about whether legal theory is evaluative is not\nwhether legal theory in principle could be evaluative, but whether it\nis inevitably or necessarily so.\n\n\nNow we are in a position to fully appreciate the question of primary\ninterest here. In particular, it is whether theories about the nature\nof existing legal practice (or perhaps our concept of it) necessarily\ninvolve or entail thick evaluative claims about the law. That\nis, does offering a first-order theory of law of either the conceptual\nanalysis, reductive or constructive interpretation varieties require\none to accept claims about how valuable the law, or some feature of it,\nis? This is the question to be discussed in the remainder of this\nentry.\n2.2.2 Is Legal Theory Evaluative in the Relevant Sense?\n\n\nSome answers to the question that was discussed in section 2.1 suggest that\ntheories of law are inherently evaluative in the sense of committing\nadvocates of these theories to thick evaluative claims about the law.\nAs we will see, this is most plausibly the case on the constructive\ninterpretation view of methodology. By contrast, other answers to the\nquestion discussed in section 2.1 do not obviously entail that\nfirst-order legal theories commit their proponents to thick evaluative\nclaims. In particular, this is the case for the conceptual analysis and\nreductive views of jurisprudential methodology. At least on their face,\nboth these views seem to allow that there can be purely descriptive\naccounts of law\u2014i.e., accounts that capture the central\nfeatures of law without being committed to any moral or\nall-things-considered evaluation of the law. After all, one might think\nthat a particular account does a good job of capturing some widely\nshared concept of law, but this does not obviously commit one to saying\nthat law, on this concept of it, is good. Likewise, one might\nendorse a reduction of legal facts to some more foundational set of\nfacts (e.g., certain social facts) without this committing one\nto thinking that the law is valuable or morally justified.\n\n\nAs a result, at least on their face, both the conceptual analysis\nand reductive views seem to allow that there can be first-order\ntheories of law that are purely descriptive. Some argument would be\nneeded if one is to endorse the opposite conclusion. Accordingly, let\nus consider some prominent arguments for thinking that legal theory\nmust be inherently evaluative in nature. (For an overview, see Marmor\n2011, 122\u201335.)\nThe argument from legal functions\n\n\nOne central argument to the effect that legal theory must be\nevaluative in the relevant sense begins from the idea that\nunderstanding what the law is requires taking a view about\nwhat functions it serves (Finnis 1980, 12\u201317; Perry 1995,\n114\u201320).  Moreover, one might think that functions are\nevaluative in the sense that attributing a function to something is to\nendorse a standard by which that thing may be judged as successful or\nunsuccessful. In this way, one might think that legal theory, too, is\ninherently evaluative.\n\n\nWhile this line of thinking plausibly shows that legal theory requires\naccepting some evaluative claims, it does not obviously show that\nlegal theory necessarily involves thick evaluative claims\n(Dickson 2001, 114\u2013125). Claims of the form \u201cthe function\nof \\(X\\) is \\(F\\)\u201d are naturally classified together with\n\u201c\\(X\\) is important\u201d (or more precisely, \u201c\\(X\\) is\nimportant for some purpose \\(Y\\)\u201d) as thin evaluative\nclaims. Accordingly, asserting that the function of law is \\(F\\) does\nnot obviously entail any thick evaluative claims about law. After all,\nit is not obvious why attributing a function to something requires\nbelieving that performing that function is either\nall-things-considered or morally good.  Thus, attributing a\nfunction to law need not entail any thick evaluative claims.\nThe argument from the internal point of view\n\n\nA second natural argument in favor of seeing legal theory as\ninherently evaluative in the relevant sense relies on the idea that any\nadequate theory of law must take account of the internal point of view\nthat legal practitioners tend to adopt towards the law. More\nspecifically, taking the internal point of view towards the law is a\nmatter of adopting some kind of attitude of endorsement towards it,\nseeing it as in some sense justified or as providing reasons for\naction (Shapiro 2011, 96\u201397; Perry 1995, 99\u2013100;\n see also the entry on \n legal positivism).\n Moreover, it is common to think that a critical mass of the\nparticipants in legal practice must adopt the internal point of view\ntowards the practice in order for the practice to genuinely count as\nlaw. This is a fact that any adequate theory of law must account for,\none might think. Accordingly, since the internal point of view involves\na positive evaluation of the law, and since any adequate legal theory\nmust account for this point of view, one might infer that any adequate\ntheory of law must itself be inherently evaluative. (One finds versions\nof such an argument, e.g., in Perry 1995, 121\u201325; Waldron\n2001, 423\u201328.)\n\n\nIt is unclear whether this argument succeeds, however. After all, it\nseems in principle possible to explain what kinds of considerations\nlegal practitioners endorse, and why, without oneself\nendorsing those considerations. Similarly, a first-order legal theory\nmight be able to plausibly explain the truism that legal practitioners\ntend to take the internal point of view towards (i.e., endorse)\nthe law in their respective jurisdictions without the theory thereby\nbeing committed to the claim that the law in any particular\njurisdiction (or the law in general) is valuable or justified.\nAccordingly, it is not obvious why a theory of law cannot in principle\ncapture the internal point of view taken by legal practitioners towards\nthe law without itself being committed to any thick evaluative claims\nabout the law.\nThe argument from interpretation\n\n\nProbably the most influential argument for thinking that legal theory\nis inherently evaluative proceeds from the idea that legal theory is\nan interpretive endeavor in Dworkin\u2019s sense (Dworkin 1986; for\ncriticism, see Dickson 2001, 105; Marmor 2011, 126\u201330). To say\nthat legal theory is an interpretive project is to claim that fully\nunderstanding what the law is requires construing it as the\nbest instance it can be of the type of thing that it is. Moreover, one\nmight think that in order to construe legal practice as the best\ninstance of the kind of thing that it is requires making thick\nevaluative claims about the law. (See the entry\n on\n legal interpretivism.)\n\n\n\nOne might attempt to respond to this argument in two ways. A\nnatural, though ultimately unsuccessful, reply is that construing\nsomething as the best instance of its kind that it can be does not\nrequire taking that kind to be good. Saying that Bernie Madoff\nwas (for a time) the best fraudster in history does not entail that one\napproves of fraud. As a result, saying that the law must be thus-and-so\nin order to be a good instance of its kind does not commit one to any\nthick evaluative claims. Nonetheless, there is a deeper or more\ninteresting sense in which Dworkin\u2019s view renders legal theory\ninherently evaluative. For Dworkin, legal theory is an interpretive\nenterprise, and offering a constructive interpretation of legal\npractice requires construing it in its best moral light. Thus,\noffering an interpretation of legal practice would require taking a\nstand on which of the available ways of construing that practice is\nmorally better than the others. Of course, this does not necessarily\nrequire asserting that the law, on any particular construal, is\ngood\u2014full stop. But it does seem to require at least\nsaying that some construals of legal practice are morally\nbetter than other construals would be. This looks to be a\nthick evaluative claim, albeit a comparative one. Moreover, one cannot\nmake such comparative judgments without having a view about what would\nmake one construal of legal practice morally better than another. Thus,\nin at least this sense, taking legal theory to be an endeavor that is\ninterpretive in Dworkin\u2019s sense would make legal theory count as\ninherently evaluative in the sense we are concerned with here.\n\n\nAccordingly, if one wants to maintain the possibility of purely\ndescriptive first-order legal theories, a more promising strategy for\nresponding to the argument from interpretation would be to question its\nkey premise\u2014viz., that legal theory necessarily is an\ninterpretive endeavor in Dworkin\u2019s sense. In order for a\nproponent of the argument from interpretation to assert this premise,\nsome rationale would have to be given for it. That is, some argument\nwould be needed to explain why we should think that\nunderstanding law requires giving a constructive\ninterpretation of it. A critic of the argument from interpretation,\nthen, might claim that the argument\u2019s proponents have not carried\ntheir burden of providing a rationale for this premise, on which the\nargument crucially depends.\n\n\nOne possible rationale that might be offered here is that since\nsocial practices essentially involve communication, and understanding\nany form of communication necessarily involves interpreting\nspeakers\u2019 claims, understanding the social practice of law\nnecessarily involves interpreting it. However, this rationale is too\nquick. Even if it is true that understanding any social practice\nrequires interpretation of some kind or other, it does not\nfollow that doing so requires a constructive interpretation in\nDworkin\u2019s sense\u2014i.e., identifying a construal\nof the practice that casts it in its best moral light (Marmor 2011,\n127\u201328). But the latter claim, of course, is what proponents of the\nargument from interpretation need to establish in order to reach their\ndesired conclusion that legal theory is inherently evaluative.\n\n\nAccordingly, we seem to be left in the following dialectical\nsituation. Whether or not legal theory is inherently evaluative in the\nrelevant sense depends on whether the argument from interpretation\nsucceeds. Whether that argument succeeds, in turn, depends on its key\npremise, i.e., the claim that understanding the law necessarily\nrequires giving a constructive interpretation of it. If a\nnon-question begging argument can be given for this claim, then there\nwould be reason to think that legal theory necessarily is evaluative in\nnature. By contrast, if no non-question begging argument can be given\nfor thinking that understanding law requires a constructive\ninterpretation, then one would be free to maintain that there can be\npurely descriptive first-order legal theories.\n\n\nOf course, even if the argument from interpretation fails and purely\ndescriptive legal theories remain possible, it could still be\na worthwhile project to attempt to give a constructive interpretation\nof legal practice, and the output of this project would indeed be a\npartially evaluative theory. Nonetheless, these two types of theory\nwould not genuinely be in conflict, as they would be addressed to\nanswering different questions. In the end, therefore,\n\u201cmethodological pluralism\u201d may be the most apt\ncharacterization of the state of play in jurisprudence.",
