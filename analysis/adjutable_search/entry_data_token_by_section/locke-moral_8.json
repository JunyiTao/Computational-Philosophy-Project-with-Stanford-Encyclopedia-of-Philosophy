    "main_text": "Moral motivation 1: reward and punishment || Locke\u2019s theory of moral motivation\n3.2 Locke\u2019s theory of moral motivation\n\nPleasure and pain form the basis of Locke\u2019s general theory of\nmotivation, but they are also the bedrock upon which our moral ideas,\nand the motivation to moral goodness arise. Good and\nevil reduce, for Locke, to \u201cnothing but Pleasure or\nPain, or that which occasions or procures Pleasure and Pain to\nus\u201d (Essay, 2.28.5). A flower is good, because its\nbeauty raises feelings of affection or pleasure in us. Illness, on the\nother hand, is an evil since it raises feelings of aversion in those\nwho have experienced illness in any of its many forms. A good\nis whatever produces pleasure in us, or diminishes evil, and an\nevil is whatever produces pain or diminishes pleasure. In\nthis way, for Locke, the ideas of good and evil arise from natural\nemotive responses to our various ideas. Now, these are not moral goods\nand evils, but for Locke moral ideas are founded in the general ideas\nwe have of natural pleasures and pains. Locke designates no special\nfaculty by which we acquire the basic moral concepts of good and evil,\nsince these are merely a modification of our ideas of natural good and\nevil; moral good and evil gain their special significance from\nconsidering ideas of pleasure and pain in specific contexts.\n\nOur ideas of moral good and evil do not, therefore, differ\nqualitatively from natural good or evil. If this is the case,\nhowever, one might ask what makes smelling a rose different from\nhelping those in need. For Locke, the answer lies in the different\ncontext for pleasures and pains that distinguishes the moral from the\nnatural. While a natural good involves the physical pleasure that\narises from the scent of a rose, moral good is a pleasure\narising from one\u2019s conformity to moral dictates, and moral\nevil is pain arising from the failure to conform. The pleasure and\npain are not qualitatively distinct, in these cases, but they take on\na special significance as a result of the considerations that bring\nthem about. Locke explains this in the Essay, making sure to\nemphasize the purely contextual distinction between moral and natural\nfeelings:\n\nMorally Good and Evil then, is only the Conformity or\nDisagreement of our voluntary Actions to some Law, whereby Good and\nEvil is drawn on us, from the Will and Power of the Law-maker; which\nGood and Evil, Pleasure or Pain, attending our observance or breach of\nthe law, by the Decree of the Law-maker, is that we call\nReward or Punishment. (Essay, 2.28.5)\n\n\nReward and punishment are a distinct species of pleasure and pain,\nspecifying the outcomes attending the decrees of a rightful\nlegislator. In this way, Locke\u2019s is a straightforwardly legalistic\naccount of the concepts of moral good and evil. The practical force of\nmoral laws arises when we compare our actions against these laws,\ndetermine the degree to which they do or do not conform to the law and\nconsider the pleasure of pain we will privately experience. In fact,\nfor Locke, the very idea that one being has rightful legislative power\nover another is predicated on the degree to which the former being can\neffectively impose sanctions on the latter:\n\nIt would be in vain for one intelligent Being, to set a Rule to the\nActions of another, if he had not in his Power, to reward the\ncompliance with, and punish deviation from his Rule, by some Good and\nEvil, that is not the natural product and consequence of the action\nitself. (Essay, 2.28.6)\n\n\nGod, according to Locke, is just such a rightful superior with the\n\nGoodness and Wisdom to direct our Actions to that which is best: and\nhe has the Power to enforce it by Rewards and Punishments, of infinite\nweight and duration, in another Life. (Essay, 2.28.8)\n\n\nLocke is clearly committed to the idea that hedonistically-construed\noutcomes are a necessary condition of any system of law and of\nlegislative authority itself. In this regard, Locke\u2019s views are\nconsistent throughout his corpus. It is worth noting that Locke holds\nthe same view in the early work, the Essays on the Law of\nNature, as he does in the more mature works quoted above. In the\nEssays on the Law of Nature, Essay V, Locke\nasserts that both God and the soul\u2019s immortality \u201cmust\nnecessarily be presupposed if natural law is to exist\u201d (Locke\n1663\u201364, 113). The inclusion of the immortality of the soul\nwould seem to suggest the centrality of rewards and punishments in the\nafterlife. Locke continues by asserting that \u201claw is to no\npurpose without punishment\u201d (Locke 1663\u201364, 113). For\nLocke, then, an agent may well know the moral law, and that they are\nobligated to a superior authority, but the obligatory\nforce\u2014i.e., what gives the agent a reason for acting\u2014is\nthe structure of rewards and punishments built into the system.\n\nThe question that has plagued Locke scholarship has been how, if at\nall, the hedonistic elements of Locke\u2019s moral philosophy can be\nreconciled with his rationalistic account, which suggests that reason\ncan discern morality\u2019s inherent righteousness and motivate\naccordingly. Some scholars have concluded that Locke effectively\nabandons the rationalism of his earlier writings by the time he is\nwriting the Essay, and that any such elements found therein\nare mere holdovers of an earlier position. Von Leyden expresses this\nview when he writes,\n\nthe development of [Locke\u2019s] hedonism and certain other views held by\nhim in later years make it indeed difficult for him to adhere\nwhole-heartedly to his doctrine of natural law. (von Leyden, 1954, 14)\n\n\nBut does it? What I earlier called the compatibilist thesis is held\nmost prominently by scholars John Colman and Stephen Darwall,\naccording to whom Locke\u2019s hedonism does not supplant the rationalist\naccount of natural law and moral obligation, but is, rather, intended\nto account for the motivational force of moral law. In this way, the\ntwo views work together for a complete moral picture. Darwall\nidentifies the distinction between rationally-derived versus\nlegalistically-construed moral obligation when he writes\n\nwhat makes God\u2019s commands morally obligatory [i.e., God\u2019s authority]\nappears\u2026to have nothing intrinsically to do with what makes\nthem rationally compelling. (Darwall 1995, 37)\n\n\nColman makes a similar point:\n\nRight is the central concept in Locke\u2019s natural law doctrine, but the\nlaw could have no purchase on human conduct unless doing that which is\nright were in some way productive of good. \u2018Good\u2019 is the\ncentral concept in his moral psychology. (Colman 1983, 49)\n\n\nBoth Darwall and Colman understand Locke as equating moral good and\nevil with rewards and punishments, such that good and evil are the\noperative notions that turn moral rules into moral imperatives for\nrational agents. Agents do not have reasons for acting until they are\naware of the rewards and punishments that accompany natural law. On\nthis interpretation, rational insight regarding the righteousness of\nmorality cannot, on its own, motivate humans to act.\n\nDivine sanctions are a constant feature of Locke\u2019s moral philosophy,\nas we\u2019ve seen, and the compatibilist interpretation goes much further\nthan the incompatibilist interpretation in capturing the nuances in\nLocke\u2019s moral philosophy. However, there are passages in Locke\u2019s work\nthat suggest that moral rules carry an obligatory force that can\nmotivate rational agents irrespective of rewards and punishments. When\nthis further aspect of Locke\u2019s view is taken into account, we can see\nthat, for Locke, rewards and punishments do not exhaust our reasons\nfor obeying divine moral rules.\n",
