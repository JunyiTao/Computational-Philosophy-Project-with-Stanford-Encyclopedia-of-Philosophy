    "main_text": "Semantic Analyses of Gen || The Indexical Approach\n2.3 The Indexical Approach\n\nSterken (2015a) has recently argued that relevant quantification alone\ncannot capture the extent to which generics are context-sensitive.\nAccording to Sterken, not only does lexical restriction vary as a\nfunction of context, but so does quantificational force. As an\nillustration, consider the generic \u201ccats are black\u201d. This\ncould be uttered by parents trying to teach their children about cats,\nor it could be uttered in response to a teacher asking the class what\ncolors cats are. In the first context, the truth of \u201ccats are\nblack\u201d seems to require that all cats be black. In the second\ncontext, the truth of \u201ccats are black\u201d seems to require\nonly that some cats are black.\n\nSterken argues that the best explanation of why the truth conditions\nof generics vary across context in this way and others is that\nGen is an indexical. In terms of logical form, this means\nthat Gen is composed of two free variables: one representing\nquantificational force and one representing lexical restriction. Like\nall indexicals, Gen has what Kaplan (1989) calls a\ncharacter, a function from contexts of utterance to the\nsemantic values. Given a context of utterance, the character of\nGen assigns semantic values to the free variables, resulting\nin the generic expression having as its content a particular\ngeneralization. The resulting view is intended to capture the various\nways the truth conditions of a generic depend not only on the kind in\nquestion and the property being predicated, but also on the wider\ncontext of utterance.\n\nThe main challenge for the indexical approach is that of specifying\nthe character of Gen. Sterken suggests that the character of\nGen is such that the content of a generic utterance depends\non what generalization the speaker intends the utterance to express\nand whether her intention could be recognized by a sufficiently\nidealized person that is privy to the conversation. If the character\nof Gen is as described, this seems to explain why generics\ncan be so flexible. However, it also seems to make generics\ntoo flexible: some generics (e.g., \u201ctigers don\u2019t\nhave stripes\u201d, \u201cravens are white\u201d) seem\nstraightforwardly false and some generics seem straightforwardly true\n(e.g., \u201ctriangles have three sides\u201d, \u201cprimates\naren\u2019t avians\u201d), regardless of the speaker\u2019s\nintentions (and of anyone\u2019s ability to detect those intentions).\nWhether such an account can handle such cases remains to be seen.\nMoreover, the indexical account is supplemented by Sterken with an\nerror theory for generics such as \u201cmosquitoes carry West Nile\nvirus\u201d (2015b), further increasing its flexibility. For critical\ndiscussion of the motivation for the error theory, see Almotahari\n(forthcoming). More generally, the indexical account\u2014unless it\nis supplemented with a rich metasemantic account of the character of\nGen\u2014is not clearly constrained enough to issue in\nsubstantive predictions concerning the truth/falsity of generics.\n",
