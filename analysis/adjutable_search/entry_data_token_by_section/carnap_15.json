    "main_text": "The Road to Syntax\n4. The Road to Syntax\n\nThe Wittgensteinian program favored by the Vienna Circle\n (section 2.4\n above) had collapsed in 1930. But Carnap soon recovered, and during a\nsleepless night on 21 January 1931, conceived of an entirely new basis\nfor the Vienna Circle\u2019s characteristic doctrines (Awodey &\nCarus 2009). Instead of trying to fuse Hilbert and Wittgenstein,\nCarnap now dropped Wittgenstein altogether and pursued a Hilbertian\napproach. \u201cMeaning\u201d was no longer rooted in the\ncorrespondence between configurations of elementary facts and their\nlinguistic representations. In fact, meaning was banished altogether,\nat least in our statements about the language of science (our\nmetalinguistic \u201celucidations\u201d such as those in the\nTractatus itself or the Aufbau). The scientific\nlanguage itself had empirical meaning, but how this was to be\nunderstood became a matter of dispute (the famous\n\u201cprotocol-sentence debate\u201d) within the Vienna Circle (the\nsentences recording observations were called\nProtokolls\u00e4tze by the Circle, which became\n\u201cprotocol sentences\u201d in English). This brought about\na split in the Circle between a more realistic \u201cright\nwing\u201d (who adhered to something closer to Wittgenstein\u2019s\npicture theory and held that once a state of affairs was\n\u201cregistered [konstatiert]\u201d by an observer there\ncould be no further doubt) and the \u201cleft wing\u201d who\nfollowed Carnap in his new reference-avoiding syntax program (see\nUebel 2007 on this debate). In any case our elucidations of the object\nlanguage remain, in the new syntax framework, entirely within the\nlinguistic realm; we are talking always and only about language. In\nlogical syntax, we should be careful not to talk about\n\u201cfacts\u201d or \u201cthings\u201d but instead only about\nsentences or thing-names. We should restrict ourselves in principle to\nthe \u201cformal mode of speech\u201d (sentences and names),\nemploying the \u201cmaterial mode of speech\u201d (facts and things)\nonly for convenience, and when we are sure we can translate it into\nthe formal mode. The (meta-)mathematical methods of Hilbert, Tarski,\nand G\u00f6del were, in other words, to be extended to the whole of\nknowledge.\n\nCarnap\u2019s immediate task was to create a canonical language for\nthe formal mode of speech. Taking his cue from Hilbert\u2019s\nmetamathematics, he began by stripping this language down to bare\nbones, eliminating all problematic assumptions. It would consist\nsimply of strings of dots on a page, and the basic laws of arithmetic\nwould arise unambiguously in the metalanguage from the immediately\nevident patterns of dots (e.g., the commutative law from the\nperceptibly equivalent number of dots counted from the left and from\nthe right). Carnap soon found he could not express certain essential\nconcepts in this limited language, and turned instead to a more usual\naxiomatized arithmetic. This also had the advantage that, by using\nG\u00f6del\u2019s new trick of arithmetizing syntax, Carnap could now\nmore easily express the syntax of the language (i.e., its logic) in\nthe language itself. So the syntactic metalanguage collapses into the\nobject language, and there is, as before, only a single language. The\ncanonical language for the formal mode of speech seemed within his\ngrasp.\n\nThis idea also gave Carnap a new route to the elimination of\nmetaphysics, superseding the Wittgensteinian strategy with its meaning\ncriterion. The new criterion dispensed with meaning. It required that\nany statement either be at the object level (straightforwardly\nfactual) or translatable into the formal mode of speech\u2014i.e.,\ninto the canonical language or an equivalent. Carnap assumed that his\ncanonical language, once fully worked out, could express the entire\nlanguage of physics, as well as containing its own metalanguage. Since\nthe Vienna Circle\u2019s \u201cunity of science\u201d program held\nthat all knowledge was expressible in the language of physics, Carnap\nproposed his canonical language as a universal language for\nall knowledge (Carnap 1932b). Another way of expressing the new\ncriterion, then, was that any acceptable statement must be phrased in\nthe language of physics. The new idea of January 1931 flowed into\nCarnap\u2019s discussions with Neurath and others to produce the new\ndoctrine of physicalism (Uebel 2007, 2018).\n\nBut the demands on the \u201ccorrect\u201d language for the formal\nmode of speech were exorbitant. Carnap had originally wanted to keep\nit weak and uncontroversial, but it had to be capable of expressing\nall the mathematics needed for physics. On the other hand, its\narithmetized syntax had to be capable of expressing the basic concept\nof \u201canalytic truth\u201d, or it would be impossible to\ndetermine when a formal-mode statement \u201cholds\u201d. Before\n1930, it had been assumed that provability was the standard of\nmathematical truth, but now G\u00f6del had shown that for each\nconsistent and recursively axiomatized system that included enough\narithmetic, some true sentences are not provable in the system. So a\ndifferent criterion was needed, but one that would still\u2014like\nprovability\u2014pick out the logically true sentences solely by\nmeans of the formation and transformation rules of the language.\nCarnap did attempt such a criterion for \u201canalyticity\u201d in\nthe first draft of his syntax book (entitled Metalogic),\nwritten in late 1931 and the spring of 1932. He sent the typescript to\nG\u00f6del, who pointed out that the new criterion was defective. In\nfact, he added, it is impossible to define analyticity or\nlogical truth in any metalanguage that can be faithfully\nrepresented in the object language (e.g., by arithmetization); this is\nnow familiar to us as Tarski\u2019s theorem on the indefinability of\ntruth. So Carnap\u2019s single-language approach fails after all\n(Awodey & Carus 2007, 2009).\n\nAnd without the single canonical language containing its own\nmetalanguage, there is no longer any reason to regard any particular\nmetalanguage as more \u201csuitable\u201d or \u201cnatural\u201d\nthan any other. One option may turn out to be more useful\nthan another for particular purposes, but this is no reason to\nprivilege it as uniquely \u201ccorrect\u201d (or canonical). With\nG\u00f6del\u2019s assistance, Carnap developed a new definition of\nanalyticity, but it hardly seemed to matter any more; the language\nrelativity of any definition of truth or analyticity moved to the\ncenter of attention. The disputes about protocol sentences within the\nVienna Circle merged in Carnap\u2019s mind with the disputes among\nintuitionists, logicists, and formalists in the philosophy of\nmathematics.\n\nAll these disputes, he realized in the autumn of 1932, concerned the\nquestion of how to set up a language, which has no right or wrong\nanswers. One could only try out different ways, and see which ones\nworked better. This new attitude, which first appeared in\nCarnap\u2019s reply to Neurath about protocol sentences (Carnap\n1932b), received its definitive statement in the \u201cprinciple of\ntolerance\u201d quoted in 1c. above, enunciated in the\nLogical Syntax of Language (LSS: \u00a717). In this\nprinciple, the voluntarist and utopian convictions of his youth,\npartially submerged during the Aufbau period, finally found\nadequate philosophical expression. He spent the remainder of\nhis career absorbing the consequences of this breakthrough, and\nworking on a vast number of language projects within the new freedom\nit afforded.\n",
