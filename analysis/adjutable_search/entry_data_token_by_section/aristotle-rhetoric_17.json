    "main_text": "The Enthymeme || Different Types of Enthymemes\n6.5 Different Types of Enthymemes\n\nJust as there is a difference between real and apparent or fallacious\ndeductions in dialectic, we have to distinguish between real and\napparent or fallacious enthymemes in rhetoric. The topoi for\nreal enthymemes are given in chapter II.23, for fallacious enthymemes\nin chapter II.24. The fallacious enthymeme pretends to include a valid\ndeduction, while it actually rests on a fallacious inference.\n\nFurther, Aristotle distinguishes between enthymemes taken from\nprobable (eikos) premises and enthymemes taken from signs\n(s\u00eameia). (Rhet. I.2, 1357a32\u201333). In a\ndifferent context, he says that enthymemes are based on probabilities,\nexamples, tekm\u00earia (i.e., proofs, evidences), and signs\n(Rhet. II.25, 1402b12\u201314). Since the so-called\ntekm\u00earia are a subclass of signs and the examples are\nused to establish general premises, this is only an extension of the\nformer classification. (Note that neither classification interferes\nwith the idea that premises have to be accepted opinions: with respect\nto the signs, the audience must believe that they exist and\naccept that they indicate the existence of something else,\nand with respect to the probabilities, people must accept\nthat something is likely to happen.) However, it is not clear whether\nthis is meant to be an exhaustive typology. That most of the\nrhetorical arguments are taken from probable premises (\u201cFor the\nmost part it is true that \u2026\u201d \u201cIt is likely that\n\u2026\u201d) is due to the typical subjects of public speech,\nwhich are rarely necessary. When using a sign-argument or\nsign-enthymeme we do not try to explain a given fact; we just indicate\nthat something exists or is the case: \u201c\u2026\nanything such that when it is another thing is, or when it has come\ninto being, the other has come into being before or after, is a sign\nof the other\u2019s being or having come into being.\u201d\n(Prior Analytics II.27, 70a7ff.). But there are several types\nof sign-arguments too; Aristotle offers the following examples:\n\n\n\n\u00a0\nRhetoric I.2\nPrior Analytics II.27 \n\n(i)\nWise men are just, since Socrates is just.\nWise men are good, since Pittacus is good. \n\n(ii)\nHe is ill, since he has fever. / She has given birth, since she\nhas milk.\nThis woman has a child, since she has milk. \n\n(iii)\nThis man has fever, since he breathes rapidly.\nShe is pregnant, since she is pale.  \n\n\nSign-arguments of type (i) and (iii) can always be refuted, even if\nthe premises are true; that is to say that they do not include a valid\ndeduction (sullogismos); Aristotle calls them\nasullogistos (non-deductive). Sign-arguments of type (ii) can\nnever be refuted if the premise is true, since, for example, it is not\npossible that someone has fever without being ill, or that someone has\nmilk without having given birth, etc. This latter type of\nsign-enthymemes is necessary and is also called\ntekm\u00earion (proof, evidence). Now, if some\nsign-enthymemes are valid deductions and some are not, it is tempting\nto ask whether Aristotle regarded the non-necessary sign-enthymemes as\napparent or fallacious arguments. However, there seems to be a more\nattractive reading: We accept a fallacious argument only if we are\ndeceived about its logical form. But we could regard, for example, the\ninference \u201cShe is pregnant, since she is pale\u201d as a good\nand informative argument, even if we know that it does not include a\nlogically necessary inference. So it seems as if Aristotle\ndidn\u2019t regard all non-necessary sign-arguments as fallacious or\ndeceptive; but even if this is true, it is difficult for Aristotle to\ndetermine the sense in which non-necessary sign-enthymemes are valid\narguments, since he is bound to the alternatives of deduction and\ninduction, and neither class seems appropriate for non-necessary\nsign-arguments.\n",
