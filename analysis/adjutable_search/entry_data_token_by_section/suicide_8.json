    "main_text": "The Morality and Rationality of Suicide || Libertarian Views and the Right to Suicide\n3.4 Libertarian Views and the Right to Suicide\n\nFor libertarians, suicide is morally permissible because individuals\nenjoy a right to suicide. (It does not of course follow that\nsuicide is necessarily rational or prudent.) Libertarianism, which has\nhistorical precedent in the Stoics and in Schopenhauer, is strongly\nassociated with the \u2018anti-psychiatry\u2019 movement of the last\nhalf century. According to that movement, attempts by the state or by\nthe medical profession to interfere with suicidal behavior are\nessentially coercive attempts to pathologize morally permissible\nexercises of individual freedom (Szasz 2002).\n\nLibertarianism typically asserts that the right to suicide is a\nright of noninterference, to wit, that others are morally\nbarred from interfering with suicidal behavior. Some assert the\nstronger claim that the right to suicide is a liberty right,\nsuch that individuals have no duty to forego suicide (i.e., that\nsuicide violates no moral duties), or a claim right,\naccording to which other individuals may be morally obliged not only\nnot to interfere with a person\u2019s suicidal behavior but to assist\nin that behavior. (See the entry on\n rights.)\n Our having a claim right to suicide implies that we also have rights\nof noninterference and of liberty and is a central worry about\nphysician-assisted suicide (Pabst Battin 1996, 163\u2013164). Since\nwhether we have a liberty right to suicide concerns whether it\nviolates other moral obligations, including obligations to other\npeople, I shall leave discussion of that issue to\n section 3.5\n and focus here on whether there is a right of noninterference.\n(Whether suicidal individuals have a claim right to others\u2019\nassistance is addressed in\n section 3.8.)\n\nA popular basis supporting a right to suicide is the idea that we own\nour bodies and hence are morally permitted to dispose of them as we\nwish. (Recall from\n section 3.3\n that some religious arguments for the impermissibility of suicide\ndepend on God\u2019s ownership of our bodies.) On this view, our\nrelationship to our bodies is like that of our relationship to other\nitems over which we enjoy property rights: Just as our having a right\nto a wristwatch permits us to use, improve, and dispose of it as we\nwish, so too does our having a right to our bodies permit us to\ndispose of them as we see fit. Consequently, since property rights are\nexclusive (i.e., our having property rights to a thing prohibits\nothers from interfering with it), others may not interfere with our\nefforts to end our lives.\n\nThe notion of self-ownership gives rise to certain puzzles though.\nOwnership seems to (a) involve two metaphysically distinct entities,\nthe owned (my wristwatch) and the owner (me), and (b), an act or event\nby which one acquires a property right in thing owned. It is not\nobvious how to make sense of either of these facts in the case of\nself-ownership or ownership of one\u2019s body. While we can give\naway our bodies (donating a kidney, for example, or willing that our\ncorpses be used for scientific research), our coming to own our bodies\nis harder to grasp. We did not, after all, create our own bodies,\npurchase them, etc. And while it may be true that we come to own our\nbodies because they are a gift from others (God or our biological\nparents), this seems to require that there already exist some\nnon-embodied self to serve as the recipient of this gift.\nSelf-ownership might therefore seem to require a controversial\ndualistic metaphysics of the self, at odds with a naturalistic\nphilosophical perspective wherein we are essentially embodied beings.\n(Cholbi 2011, 84\u201386) Perhaps self-ownership is a metaphor meant\nto capture a similar property-like set of rights we have toward our\nbodies,rights that allow us to exercise property-like control or\nauthority over our bodies. (Kluge 1975, 119) Finally, a right to\nsuicide rooted in a putative right of self-ownership would not be\nunlimited. For uses of one\u2019s property, including its\ndestruction, can be harmful to others. Thus, even on the assumption\nthat we do own our own bodies, we may be morally required to refrain\nfrom suicide when and because the destruction of our bodies harms\nothers. (See\n section 3.5\n for arguments concerning duties to others.)\n",
