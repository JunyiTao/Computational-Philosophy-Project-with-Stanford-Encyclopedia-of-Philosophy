    "main_text": "What is  Nominalism?\n1. What is  Nominalism?\n\n\nThe word \u2018Nominalism\u2019, as used by contemporary\nphilosophers in the Anglo-American tradition, is ambiguous. In one\nsense, its most traditional sense deriving from the Middle Ages, it\nimplies the rejection of universals. In another, more modern\nbut equally entrenched sense, it implies the rejection of abstract\nobjects. To say that these are distinct senses of the word\npresupposes that universal and abstract object do not\nmean the same thing. And in fact they do not. For although different\nphilosophers mean different things by universal, and likewise\nby abstract object, according to widespread usage a universal\nis something that can be instantiated by different entities and an\nabstract object is something that is neither spatial nor temporal.\n\n\nThus there are (at least) two kinds of Nominalism, one that\nmaintains that there are no universals and one that maintains that\nthere are no abstract\n objects.[1]\nRealism about universals is the doctrine that\nthere are universals, and Platonism is the doctrine that there are\nabstract objects.\n\n\nBut Nominalism is not simply the rejection of universals or abstract\nobjects. For if that were the case, a nihilist, someone who believed\nthat there are no entities at all, would count as a nominalist.\nSimilarly, someone who rejected universals or abstract objects but were\nagnostic about the existence of particulars or concrete objects would\ncount as a nominalist. Given how the term \u2018Nominalism\u2019 is\nused in contemporary philosophy, such philosophers would not be\nnominalists. The word \u2018Nominalism\u2019 carries an implication\nthat the corresponding doctrine asserts that everything is particular\nor concrete, and that this is not vacuously true.\n\n\nThus one kind of Nominalism asserts that there are particular\nobjects and that everything is particular, and the other asserts that\nthere are concrete objects and that everything is concrete.\n\n\nAs noted above, the two forms of nominalism are independent. The\npossibility of being a nominalist in one sense but not in the other has\nbeen exemplified in the history of philosophy. For instance, David\nArmstrong (1978; 1997) is a believer in universals, and so he is not a\nnominalist in the sense of rejecting universals, but he believes that\neverything that exists is spatiotemporal, and so he is a\nnominalist in the sense of rejecting abstract objects. And there are\nthose who, like Quine at a certain point of his philosophical\ndevelopment (1964; 1981), accept sets or classes and so are not\nnominalists in the sense of rejecting abstract objects and yet reject\nuniversals and so are nominalists in the sense of rejecting\nuniversals.\n\n\nThus Nominalism, in both senses, is a kind of anti-realism. For one\nkind of Nominalism denies the existence, and therefore the reality, of\nuniversals and the other denies the existence, and therefore the\nreality, of abstract objects. But what does Nominalism claim with\nrespect to the entities alleged by some to be universals or abstract\nobjects, e.g. properties, numbers, propositions, possible worlds? Here\nthere are two general options: (a) to deny the existence of the alleged\nentities in question, and (b) to accept the existence of these entities\nbut to argue that they are particular or concrete.\n\n\nSometimes Nominalism is identified with those positions exemplifying\nstrategy (a). But this seems to be based on the thought that what makes\na position nominalist is the rejection of properties, numbers,\npropositions, etc. In this entry, however, I shall understand\nNominalism in a broader way, namely as encompassing positions\nimplementing strategies (a) or (b) above. For Nominalism has nothing\nagainst properties, numbers, propositions, possible worlds, etc.,\nas such. What Nominalism finds uncongenial in entities like\nproperties, numbers, possible worlds and propositions is that they are\nsupposed to be universals or abstract objects. Thus the mere rejection\nof properties, numbers, possible worlds, propositions, etc., does not\nmake one a nominalist \u2013 to be a nominalist one needs to reject\nthem because they are supposed to be universals or abstract\nobjects. Michael Jubien, for instance, rejects propositions, but he\nadmits properties and relations construed Platonistically; his reasons\nfor rejecting propositions have nothing to do with their alleged\nabstract character (Jubien 2001: 48\u201354). It would be odd to call\nJubien a nominalist about propositions.\n\n\nThus according to my usage in this entry, acceptance of the existence\nof properties, propositions, possible worlds and numbers is compatible\nwith being a nominalist. What is required of nominalists who accept\nthe existence of numbers, properties, possible worlds and propositions\nis that they think of them as particulars or concrete\nobjects.[2] And\nrejecting properties, propositions, possible worlds, numbers, and any\nother items is not sufficient for being a Nominalist about them: to be\na Nominalist one must reject them on account of their being universal\nor abstract objects.\n",
