    "preamble": "\n\nBefore the terrorist attacks in the United States on 11 September\n2001, the subject of terrorism did not loom large in philosophical\ndiscussion. Philosophical literature in English amounted to a few\nmonographs and a single collection of papers devoted solely, or\nlargely, to questions to do with terrorism. Articles on the subject in\nphilosophy journals were few and far between; neither of the two major\nphilosophy encyclopedias had an entry. The attacks of September 11 and\ntheir aftermath put terrorism on the philosophical agenda: it is now\nthe topic of numerous books, journal articles, special journal issues,\nand conferences.\n\nWhile social sciences study the causes, main varieties, and\nconsequences of terrorism and history traces and attempts to explain\nthe way terrorism has evolved over time, philosophy focuses on two\nfundamental\u2014and related\u2014questions. The first is\nconceptual: What is terrorism? The second is moral: Can terrorism ever\nbe morally justified?\n\nPhilosophers have offered a range of positions on both questions. With\nregard to the problem of defining terrorism, the dominant approach\nseeks to acknowledge the core meaning \u201cterrorism\u201d has in\ncommon use. Terrorism is understood as a type of violence. Many\ndefinitions highlight the experience of terror or fear as the\nproximate aim of that violence. Neither violence nor terror is\ninflicted for its own sake, but rather for the sake of a further aim\nsuch as coercion, or some more specific political objective. But there\nare also definitions that sever the conceptual connection of terrorism\nwith violence or with terror. With regard to the moral standing of\nterrorism, philosophers differ both on how that is to be determined\nand what the determination is. Consequentialists propose to judge\nterrorism, like everything else, in light of its consequences.\nNonconsequentialists argue that its moral status is not simply a\nmatter of what consequences, on balance, terrorism has, but is rather\ndetermined, whether solely or largely, by what it is. Positions on the\nmorality of terrorism range from justification when its consequences\non balance are good, or when some deontological moral requirements are\nsatisfied, to its absolute, or almost absolute, rejection.\n\nPhilosophers working in applied philosophy have also sought to\ncomplement the discussions of terrorism in general with case\nstudies\u2014studies of the role and rights and wrongs of terrorism\nin particular conflicts, such as \u201cthe Troubles\u201d in\nNorthern Ireland (George 2000; Simpson 2004; Shanahan 2009), the\nIsraeli-Palestinian conflict (Ashmore 1997; Gordon and Lopez 2000; Primoratz 2006;\nKapitan 2008; Law (ed.) 2008), and the bombing of German cities in\nWorld War II (Grayling 2006; Primoratz 2010).\n",

    "main_text": "\n1. The conceptual issue\n\nThe history of terrorism is probably coextensive with the history of\npolitical violence. The term \u201cterrorism\u201d, however, is\nrelatively recent: it has been in use since late 18th century. Its use\nhas repeatedly shifted in some significant respects. Moreover, in\ncontemporary political discourse the word is often employed as a\npolemical term whose strong emotional charge occludes its somewhat\nvague descriptive meaning. All this tends to get in the way of\nsustained rational discussion of the nature and moral standing of\nterrorism and the best ways of coping with it.\n1.1 \u201cTerrorism\u201d from the French Revolution to the early 21st century\n1.1.1 The reign of terror\n\nWhen it first entered public discourse in the West, the word\n\u201cterrorism\u201d meant the reign of terror the Jacobins imposed\nin France from the fall of 1793 to the summer of 1794. Its ultimate\naim was the reshaping of both society and human nature. That was to be\nachieved by destroying the old regime, suppressing all enemies of the\nrevolutionary government, and inculcating and enforcing civic virtue.\nA central role in attaining these objectives was accorded to\nrevolutionary tribunals which had wide authority, were constrained by\nvery few rules of procedure, and saw their task as carrying out\nrevolutionary policy rather than meting out legal justice of the more\nconventional sort. They went after \u201cenemies of the\npeople\u201d, actual or potential, proven or suspected; the law on\nthe basis of which they were operating \u201cenumerated just who the\nenemies of the people might be in terms so ambiguous as to exclude no\none\u201d (Carter 1989: 142). The standard punishment was death.\nTrials and executions were meant to strike terror in the hearts of all\nwho lacked civic virtue; the Jacobins believed that was a necessary\nmeans of consolidating the new regime. This necessity provided both\nthe rationale of the reign of terror and its moral justification. As\nRobespierre put it, terror was but \u201can emanation of\nvirtue\u201d; without it, virtue remained impotent. Accordingly, the\nJacobins applied the term to their own actions and policies quite\nunabashedly, without any negative connotations.\n1.1.2 Propaganda by the deed\n\nYet the term \u201cterrorism\u201d and its cognates soon took on\nvery strong negative connotations. Critics of the excesses of the\nFrench Revolution had watched its reign with horror from the start.\nTerrorism came to be associated with drastic abuse of power and\nrelated to the notion of tyranny as rule based on fear, a recurring\ntheme in political philosophy.\n\nIn the second half of the 19th century, there was a shift in both\ndescriptive and evaluative meaning of the term. Disillusioned with\nother methods of political struggle, some anarchist and other\nrevolutionary organizations, and subsequently some nationalist groups\ntoo, took to political violence. They had come to the conclusion that\nwords were not enough, and what was called for were deeds: extreme,\ndramatic deeds that would strike at the heart of the unjust,\noppressive social and political order, generate fear and despair among\nits supporters, demonstrate its vulnerability to the oppressed, and\nultimately force political and social change. This was\n\u201cpropaganda by the deed\u201d, and the deed was for the most\npart assassination of royalty or highly placed government officials.\nUnlike the Jacobins\u2019 reign of terror, which operated in a\nvirtually indiscriminate way, this type of terrorism\u2014as both\nadvocates and critics called it\u2014was largely employed in a highly\ndiscriminate manner. This was especially true of Russian revolutionary\norganizations such as People\u2019s Will or Socialist Revolutionary\nParty (SR): they held that it was morally justified to assassinate a\ngovernment official only if his complicity in the oppressive regime\nwas significant enough for him to deserve to die, and the\nassassination would make an important contribution to the struggle.\nTheir violence steered clear of other, uninvolved or insufficiently\ninvolved persons. Some instances of \u201cpropaganda by the\ndeed\u201d carried out by French and Spanish anarchists in the 1880s\nand 1890s were indiscriminate killings of common citizens; but that\nwas an exception, rather than the rule. The perpetrators and some of\nthose sympathetic to their cause claimed those acts were nevertheless\nmorally legitimate, whether as retribution (exacted on the assumption\nthat no member of the ruling class was innocent) or as a means\nnecessary for the overthrow of the unjust order. Accordingly, in their\nparlance, too, the term \u201cterrorism\u201d implied no censure.\nWhen used by others, it conveyed a strong condemnation of the\npractice.\n1.1.3 The state as terrorist\n\nThe terrorism employed by both sides in the Russian Revolution and\nCivil War was in important respects a throwback to that of the\nJacobins. The government set up in Russia by the victorious Bolsheviks\nwas totalitarian. So was the Nazi rule in Germany. Both sought to\nimpose total political control on society. Such a radical aim could\nonly be pursued by a similarly radical method: by terrorism directed\nby an extremely powerful political police at an atomized and\ndefenseless population. Its success was due largely to its arbitrary\ncharacter\u2014to the unpredictability of its choice of victims. In\nboth countries, the regime first suppressed all opposition; when it no\nlonger had any opposition to speak of, political police took to\npersecuting \u201cpotential\u201d and \u201cobjective\nopponents\u201d. In the Soviet Union, it was eventually unleashed on\nvictims chosen at random. Totalitarian terrorism is the most extreme\nand sustained type of state terrorism. As Hannah Arendt put it,\n\u201cterror is the essence of totalitarian domination\u201d, and\nthe concentration camp is \u201cthe true central institution of\ntotalitarian organizational power\u201d (Arendt 1958: 464, 438).\nWhile students of totalitarianism talked of terrorism as its method of\nrule, representatives of totalitarian regimes, sensitive to the\npejorative connotation of the word, portrayed the practice as defense\nof the state from internal enemies.\n\nHowever, state terrorism is not the preserve of totalitarian regimes.\nSome non-totalitarian states have resorted to terrorism against enemy\ncivilians as a method of warfare, most notably when the RAF and USAAF\nbombed German and Japanese cities in World War II (see Lackey 2004).\nThose who designed and oversaw these campaigns never publicly\ndescribed them as \u201cterror bombing\u201d, but that was how they\noften referred to them in internal communications.\n1.1.4 Terrorists and freedom fighters\n\nAfter the heyday of totalitarian terrorism in the 1930s and 1940s,\ninternal state terrorism continued to be practiced by military\ndictatorships in many parts of the world, albeit in a less sustained\nand pervasive way. But the type of terrorism that came to the fore in\nthe second half of the 20th century and in early 21st century is that\nemployed by insurgent organizations. Many movements for national\nliberation from colonial rule resorted to it, either as the main\nmethod of struggle or as a tactic complementing guerrilla warfare. So\ndid some separatist movements. Some organizations driven by extreme\nideologies, in particular on the left, took to terrorism as\nthe way of trying to destroy what they considered an unjust,\noppressive economic, social and political system. This type of\nterrorism is, by and large, indiscriminate in its choice of target: it\nattacks men and women of whatever political (or apolitical) views,\nsocial class, and walk of life; young and old, adults and children. It\nshoots at people, or blows them up by planting bombs, in office\nbuildings, markets, cafes, cinemas, places of religious worship, on\nbuses or planes, or in other vulnerable public places. It also takes\npeople hostage, by hijacking planes and in other ways.\n\nAs \u201cterrorism\u201d has by now acquired a very strong\npejorative meaning, no-one applies the word to their own actions or to\nactions and campaigns of those they sympathize with. Insurgents\npracticing terrorism portray their actions as struggle for liberation\nand seek to be considered and treated as soldiers rather than\nterrorists or criminals. They often depict their enemy\u2014the alien\ngovernment, or the agencies of the social, political and economic\nsystem\u2014as the \u201ctrue terrorists\u201d. For them, the test\nof terrorism is not what is done, but rather what the\nultimate aim of doing it is. If the ultimate aim is\nliberation or justice, the violence used in order to attain it is not\nterrorism, whereas the violence aiming at maintaining oppression or\ninjustice, or some of the \u201cstructural violence\u201d embodying\nit, is. On the other hand, governments tend to paint all insurgent\nviolence with the brush of \u201cterrorism\u201d. Government\nspokespersons and pro-government media typically assume that terrorism\nis by definition something done by non-state agents, and that a state\ncan never be guilty of terrorism (although it can sponsor terrorist\norganizations). For them, the test of terrorism is not what is\ndone, but who does it. When a state agency uses\nviolence, it is an act of war, or reprisal, or defense of the security\nof the state and its citizens; when an insurgent group does the same,\nit is terrorism. Under these circumstances, one person\u2019s\nterrorist is indeed another\u2019s freedom fighter, and public debate\nabout terrorism is largely conducted at cross purposes and to little\neffect. Attempts of the United Nations to propose a definition of\n\u201cterrorism\u201d that could be accepted by all states and\nembedded in international law so far have been frustrated by the same\nsort of relativism. Islamic countries would accept no definition that\nallowed national liberation movements in the Middle East and Kashmir\nto be portrayed as terrorist, whereas Western countries would accept\nno definition that allowed for state agencies to be guilty of\nterrorism.\n1.2 Two core traits of terrorism and two types of definition\n1.2.1 Violence and terror\n\nThe evaluative meaning of \u201cterrorism\u201d has shifted\nconsiderably more than once. So has its descriptive meaning, but to a\nlesser degree. Whatever else the word may have meant, its ordinary use\nover more than two centuries has typically indicated two things:\nviolence and intimidation (the causing of great fear or terror,\nterrorizing). The dominant approach to the conceptual question in\nphilosophical literature reflects this. Terrorism is usually\nunderstood as a type of violence. This violence is not blind or\nsadistic, but rather aims at intimidation and at some further\npolitical, social, or religious goal or, more broadly, at\ncoercion.\n\nThat is how (political) \u201cterrorism\u201d is defined by Per\nBauhn in the first philosophical book-length study in English:\n\nThe performance of violent acts, directed against one or more persons,\nintended by the performing agent to intimidate one or more persons and\nthereby to bring about one or more of the agent\u2019s political\ngoals (Bauhn 1989: 28).\n\n\nAnother good example of a mainstream definition is provided in C.A.J.\nCoady\u2019s article on terrorism in the Encyclopedia of\nEthics:\n\nThe tactic of intentionally targeting non-combatants [or non-combatant\nproperty, when significantly related to life and security] with lethal\nor severe violence \u2026 meant to produce political results via the\ncreation of fear (Coady 2001: 1697).\n\n\nYet another example is the definition proposed by Igor Primoratz:\n\nThe deliberate use of violence, or threat of its use, against innocent\npeople, with the aim of intimidating some other people into a course\nof action they otherwise would not take (Primoratz 2013: 24).\n\n\nThese definitions put aside both the question of who the actor is and\nthe question of what their ultimate objectives are, and focus on\nwhat is done and what the proximate aim of\ndoing it is. They present terrorism as a way of acting that could be\nadopted by different agents and serve various ultimate objectives\n(most, but perhaps not all of them, political). It can be employed by\nstates or by non-state agents, and may promote national liberation or\noppression, revolutionary or conservative causes (and possibly pursue\nsome nonpolitical aims as well). One can be a terrorist and a\nfreedom fighter; terrorism is not the monopoly of enemies of freedom.\nOne can hold high government or military office and design or\nimplement a terrorist campaign; terrorism is not the preserve of\ninsurgents. In this way much of the relativism concerning who is and\nwho is not a terrorist that has plagued contemporary public debate\n(see 1.1.4 above) can be overcome.\n\nBeyond concurring that violence and intimidation constitute the core\nof terrorism, the definitions quoted above differ in several respects.\nDoes only actual violence count, or do threats of violence also\nqualify? Must terrorist violence be directed against life and limb, or\ndoes violence against (some) property also count? Does terrorism\nalways seek to attain some political goal, or can there be\nnon-political (e.g. criminal) terrorism? All these points are minor.\nThere is also one major difference: while Coady and Primoratz define\nterrorism as violence against non-combatants or innocent people,\nrespectively, Bauhn\u2019s definition includes no such restriction.\nDefinitions of the former type can be termed \u201cnarrow\u201d, and\nthose of the latter sort \u201cwide\u201d. Philosophical literature\non terrorism abounds in instances of both types.\n1.2.2 Wide and narrow definitions\n\nShould we adopt a wide or a narrow definition? A wide definition\nencompasses the entire history of \u201cterrorism\u201d from the\nJacobins to the present, and is more in accord with current ordinary\nuse. A narrow definition departs from much ordinary use by restricting\nterrorist violence to that directed at non-combatants or innocent\npersons. Thus it leaves out most of 19th century \u201cpropaganda by\nthe deed\u201d and political violence perpetrated by Russian\nrevolutionaries which they themselves and the public called\nterrorist.\n\nFor these reasons, historians of terrorism normally work with a wide\ndefinition, and social scientists do so much of the time. But\nphilosophers may well prefer a narrow definition. They focus on the\nmoral standing of terrorism and need a definition that is particularly\nhelpful in moral discourse. Morally speaking, surely there is a\ndifference\u2014for some, a world of difference\u2014between\nplanting a bomb in a government building and killing a number of\nhighly placed officials of (what one considers) an unjust and\noppressive government, and planting a bomb in a tea shop and killing a\nrandom collection of common citizens, including children. While both\nacts raise serious moral issues, these issues are not identical, and\nrunning them together under the same heading of\n\u201cterrorism\u201d will likely hamper, rather than help,\ndiscerning moral assessment.\n\nNarrow definitions are revisionary, but (unlike those discussed in the\nnext section) not implausibly so. They focus on the traits of\nterrorism that cause most of us to view the practice with deep moral\nrepugnance: (i) violence (ii) against non-combatants (or,\nalternatively, against innocent people) for the sake of (iii)\nintimidation (and, on some definitions, (iv) coercion). In\nhighlighting (ii), they relate the issue of terrorism to the ethics of\nwar and one of the fundamental principles of just war theory, that of\nnon-combatant immunity. They help distinguish terrorism from acts of\nwar proper and political assassination, which do not target\nnon-combatants or common citizens. It does not matter very much\nwhether the victims of terrorism are described as\n\u201cnon-combatants\u201d or \u201cinnocent people\u201d, as each\nterm is used in a technical sense, and both refer to those who have\nnot lost their immunity against lethal or other extreme violence by\nbeing directly involved in, or highly responsible for, (what\nterrorists consider) insufferable injustice or oppression. In war,\nthese are innocent civilians; in a violent conflict that falls short\nof war, these are common citizens.\n\nTalk of involvement of individuals and groups in injustice or\noppression raises the question: is the injustice or oppression at\nissue, and thus the standing of those implicated in it, to be\ndetermined by some objective criteria, or from the point of view of\nthose who resort to violence? Coady chooses the former option. He\napproaches terrorism from the standpoint of just war theory and its\nprinciple of noncombatant immunity. \u201cCombatants\u201d is a\ntechnical term designating agents of aggression or, more broadly,\n\u201cdangerous wrongdoers\u201d or \u201cagents of harm\u201d;\nthey are legitimate targets of potentially lethal violence. All others\nare noncombatants, and enjoy immunity from such violence (Coady 2004).\nThis approach may not be difficult to apply in war, where the wrong or\nharm at issue is either aggression that needs to be repelled, or\nsystematic and large-scale violations of human rights that provide the\nground for humanitarian intervention. Issues of injustice or\noppression that arise in an internal conflict that falls short of war,\nhowever, tend to be highly contentious: what some consider an\nimperfect, but basically morally legitimate political and social\norder, others may see as the epitome of injustice and oppression that\nmust be overthrown, if need be by violence. Under such circumstances,\nwhen a highly placed political official is killed by insurgents, that\nmay be characterized (and condemned) by many as an act of terrorism,\nwhile the insurgents and those sympathetic to their struggle may\nreject this characterization and portray (and justify) the killing as\npolitical assassination.\n\nIn order to avoid this kind of relativism, Primoratz puts forward a\nview that in one important respect takes on board the standpoint of\nthe terrorist. The direct victims of terrorism are innocent in the\nsense of not being responsible, on any credible understanding of\nresponsibility and liability, for the injustice or oppression the\nterrorists fight against\u2014not responsible at all, or at least not\nresponsible to the degree that makes them liable to be killed or\nmaimed on that account. The injustice or oppression at issue need not\nbe real; it may be merely alleged (by the terrorists). Being\nresponsible for a merely alleged great injustice or oppression is\nenough for losing one\u2019s immunity against violence, as far as the\ntype of immunity and innocence relevant to defining terrorism is\nconcerned. According to the traditional version of just war theory one\ndoes not lose immunity against acts of war only by fighting in an\nunjust war, but by fighting in any war. Similarly, one does not lose\nimmunity against political violence only by holding office in or\nimplementing policies of a gravely unjust government, but by holding\noffice in or implementing policies of any government: as King Umberto\nI of Italy said after surviving an assassination attempt, such risk\ncomes with the job. Members of these two classes are not considered\ninnocent and morally protected against violence by those attacking\nthem; the latter view their acts as acts of war proper or of political\nassassination, respectively. If the terrorists subscribe to a credible\nview of responsibility and liability, then, when they attack common\ncitizens, they attack people innocent from their own point of view,\ni.e., innocent even if we grant the terrorists their assessment of the\npolicies at issue. (This is not to say that those who consider a\ngovernment to be gravely unjust have a moral license to kill its\nofficials, but only that if they do so, that will not be terrorism,\nbut rather political assassination. We can still condemn their actions\nif we reject their judgment of the policies at issue, or if we accept\nthat judgment, but believe that they should have opposed those\npolicies by nonviolent means. But we will not be condemning their\nactions qua terrorism.)\n\nOn this account, not only real, but also merely alleged injustice or\noppression counts in determining the innocence of the victims and\ndeciding which acts are acts of terrorism; thus such decisions are not\nhostage to endless debates about the moral status of contested\npolicies. Nevertheless, a residue of relativity remains. The account\npresupposes a certain understanding of responsibility and liability: a\nperson is responsible for a state of affairs only by virtue of that\nperson\u2019s voluntary, i.e., informed and free, act or omission\nthat has a sufficiently strong connection with that state of affairs,\nand thereby becomes liable to some proportionately unfavorable\nresponse. Provided the terrorists accept some such understanding of\nresponsibility and liability, they kill and maim people they\nthemselves must admit to be innocent. To be sure, some militant\norganizations resort to violence which we perceive as terrorist, yet\nobject to the label. They profess a view of responsibility and\nliability based on extremely far-fetched connections between states of\naffairs and human choices and actions, and argue that entire social\nclasses or nations are responsible for certain policies and practices\nand all their members are liable to be attacked by deadly violence\n(for more on this, see 2.1 below). Such arguments can only be regarded\nas preposterous. We should insist on viewing their actions as\nterrorist, although they reject this description. It is not clear how\nthis residue of relativity could be removed (Primoratz 2013:\n16\u201321).\n\nSome object to defining \u201cterrorism\u201d as violence against\nnon-combatants or innocent persons. They argue that doing so runs\ntogether the question of the nature of terrorism and that of its moral\nstatus, and begs the moral issue by making terrorism unjustified by\ndefinition. We should rather keep these questions separate, and take\ncare not to prejudge the latter by giving a wrong answer to the\nformer. What is needed is a morally neutral definition of terrorism,\nand that means a wide one (Corlett 2003: 114\u201320, 134\u201335;\nYoung 2004: 57). But it is doubtful that \u201cterrorism\u201d can\nbe defined in some morally untainted way. The wide definitions these\nphilosophers adopt contain the word \u201cviolence\u201d, which is\nitself morally loaded. A narrow definition is not completely morally\nneutral, as violence against the innocent is clearly morally wrong.\nBut what is clear is that such violence is prima facie wrong.\nThe definition implies a general presumption against terrorism, not\nits sweeping moral condemnation in each and every instance, whatever\nthe circumstances and whatever the consequences of desisting from it.\nThe definition does not rule out that in certain circumstances it\nmight not be wrong, all things considered. Ethical investigation is\nnot preempted: a particular case of terrorism still needs to be judged\non its merits.\n\nAnother way of settling the issue of wide vs. narrow definition is\noffered by Georg Meggle. He adopts a wide definition of terrorism, and\ngoes on to distinguish two different types: terrorism in the strong\nsense, which deliberately, recklessly, or negligently harms innocent\npeople, and terrorism in the weak sense, which does not. Obviously,\nthe moral assessment of the two types of terrorism is going to be\nsignificantly different (Meggle 2005).\n1.2.3 Some idiosyncratic definitions\n\nThe vast majority of cases almost anyone without an ax to grind would\nwant to classify as \u201cterrorism\u201d exhibit the two traits\nimplied in ordinary use and highlighted by mainstream philosophical\ndefinitions such as those quoted above: violence and intimidation. But\nphilosophical literature also offers definitions that leave out one or\nthe other core component.\n\nSome seek to sever the connection between terrorism and violence. Carl\nWellman defines terrorism as \u201cthe use or attempted use of terror\nas a means of coercion\u201d. Terrorism is often associated with\nviolence, but that is because violence is a very effective means of\nintimidation. Yet \u201cviolence is not essential to terrorism and,\nin fact, most acts of terrorism are nonviolent\u201d (Wellman 1979:\n250\u201351). The last claim seems false on any non-circular\ninterpretation. There may be many acts generally considered terrorist\nthat do not involve actual violence, but are meant to\nintimidate by threatening it; but that is not enough to\nsupport the notion of \u201cnon-violent terrorism\u201d, which seems\nodd. So does Wellman\u2019s example of \u201cclassroom\nterrorism\u201d: a professor threatens to fail students who submit\ntheir essays after the due date, causes panic in class, and thereby\nengages in terrorism.\n\nRobert E. Goodin offers a similar account, emphasizing the political\nrole of terrorism: terrorism is \u201ca political tactic, involving\nthe deliberate frightening of people for political advantage\u201d\n(Goodin 2006: 49). This, he claims, is the distinctive wrong\nterrorists commit. Whereas on Wellman\u2019s account one can commit\nan act of terrorism without either engaging in or threatening\nviolence, merely by making a threat in order to intimidate, on\nGoodin\u2019s account one need not even make a threat: one acts as a\nterrorist by merely issuing a warning about the acts of others that is\nmeant to intimidate. This, too, seems arbitrary, although it makes\nsense as a step in an argument meant to show that \u201cif\n(or insofar as) Western political leaders are intending to\nfrighten people for their own political advantage, then (to\nthat extent) they are committing the same core wrong that is\ndistinctively associated with terrorism\u201d (Goodin 2006: 2).\n\nIt has also been suggested that terrorism need not be understood as\ninducing terror or fear. According to Ted Honderich, terrorism is best\ndefined as \u201cviolence, short of war, political, illegal and\nprima facie wrong\u201d (Honderich 2006: 88). This\ndefinition might be thought problematic on several counts, but the\nidea of \u201cterrorism\u201d without \u201cterror\u201d seems\nespecially odd. The two are connected etymologically and historically,\nand this connection is deeply entrenched in current ordinary use.\nIntimidation is not the morally salient trait of terrorism\n(pace Goodin), but it is one of its core traits that cause\nmost of us to condemn the practice. We might consider severing the\nconnection if Honderich offered a good reason for doing so. But he\nsupports his highly revisionary definition by the puzzling claim that\nto define terrorism as violence meant to intimidate is to imply that\nterrorism is particularly abhorrent and thereby \u201cin effect\n\u2026 invite a kind of prima facie approval or tolerance\nof war\u201d (Honderich 2006: 93).\n2. The moral issue\n\nCan terrorism be morally justified? There is no single answer to this\nquestion, as there is no single conception of what terrorism is. If we\nput aside definitions that depart too much, and for no compelling\nreason, from the core meaning of \u201cterrorism\u201d (such as\nthose cited in 1.2.3), we still need to decide whether the question\nassumes a wide or a narrow understanding of terrorism. A narrow\nconception of terrorism seems to be better suited to ethical\ninvestigation (1.2.2). Moreover, philosophers who work with a wide\ndefinition typically hold that terrorism that targets non-combatants\nor innocent persons is much more difficult to justify than\n\u201cselective\u201d terrorism which attacks only those who cannot\nplausibly claim innocence of the injustice or oppression at issue (and\nwhich accordingly does not count as \u201cterrorism\u201d on a\nnarrow definition of the term). The present discussion therefore\nfocuses on terrorism understood as violence against innocent civilians\nor common citizens, intended to intimidate and thereby to achieve some\nfurther (political) objective or, more broadly, to coerce.\n\nOne might try to justify some acts or campaigns of violence of this\nkind in two ways. One could argue that the victims may be\nnon-combatants or common citizens, but nevertheless are not innocent\nof the wrongs the terrorists are fighting against. Alternatively, one\ncould concede the innocence of the victims and argue that attacks on\nthem are nevertheless justified, either by their consequences on\nbalance, or by some deontological considerations.\n2.1 Complicity of the victims\n\nIf the former line of argument is successful, will it prove too much?\nIn showing that an instance of violence was justified because those\ntargeted were not really innocent, we will have shown that the act or\ncampaign of violence at issue was actually not a case of terrorism.\nThis may be merely a matter of semantics. There is a much more\ndamaging objection. A terrorist act is characteristically the killing\nor injuring of a random collection of people who happen to be in a\ncertain place at a certain time. Arguments to the effect that those\npeople are not innocent of the wrongs the terrorist fights against\nwill therefore have a very wide reach, and accordingly will\nbe based on some simplistic conception of collective responsibility.\nThese arguments will be of the sort offered, for example, by the 19th\ncentury anarchist Emile Henry. He planted a bomb at the office of a\nmining company which, if it had exploded, would have killed or injured\na number of people who did not work for the company, but lived in the\nsame building. He also planted a bomb in a caf\u00e9 that did go\noff, injuring twenty people, one of whom later died of his injuries.\nAt his trial, Henry explained: \u201cWhat about the innocent victims?\n[\u2026] The building where the Carmeaux Company had its offices was\ninhabited only by the bourgeois; hence there would be no innocent\nvictims. The whole of the bourgeoisie lives by the exploitation of the\nunfortunate, and should expiate its crimes together\u201d (Henry\n1977: 193). When commenting on the second attack, he said:\n\nThose good bourgeois who hold no office but who reap their dividends\nand live idly on the profits of the workers\u2019 toil, they also\nmust take their share in the reprisals. And not only they, but all\nthose who are satisfied with the existing order, who applaud the acts\nof the government and so become its accomplices \u2026 in other\nwords, the daily clientele of Terminus and other great caf\u00e9s!\n(Henry 1977: 195)\n\n\nThis is an utterly implausible view of responsibility and liability.\nIt claims that all members of a social class\u2014men and women,\nyoung and old, adults and children\u2014are liable to be killed or\nmaimed: some for operating the system of exploitation, others for\nsupporting it, and still others for benefiting from it. Even if, for\nthe sake of argument, we grant the anarchist\u2019s harsh moral\ncondemnation of capitalist society, not every type and degree of\ninvolvement with it can justify the use of extreme violence. Giving\nthe system political support, or benefiting from it, may be morally\nobjectionable, but is surely not enough to make one liable to be blown\nto pieces.\n\nAnother, more recent example, is provided by Osama Bin Laden. In an\ninterview in the aftermath of the attacks on September 11, 2001 he\nsaid:\n\nThe American people should remember that they pay taxes to their\ngovernment and that they voted for their president. Their government\nmakes weapons and provides them to Israel, which they use to kill\nPalestinian Muslims. Given that the American Congress is a committee\nthat represents the people, the fact that it agrees with the actions\nof the American government proves that America in its entirety is\nresponsible for the atrocities that it is committing against Muslims\n(Bin Laden 2005: 140\u2013141).\n\n\nThis, too, is a preposterous understanding of responsibility and\nliability. For it claims that all Americans are eligible to be killed\nor maimed: some for devising and implementing America\u2019s\npolicies, others for participating in the political process, still\nothers for paying taxes. Even if, for the sake of argument, we grant\nBin Laden\u2019s severe condemnation of those policies, not every\ntype and degree of involvement with them can justify the use of lethal\nviolence. Surely voting in elections or paying taxes is not enough to\nmake one fair game.\n\nAttempts at justification of terrorism that concede that its victims\nare innocent seem more promising. They fall into two groups, depending\non the type of ethical theory on which they are based.\n2.2 Consequentialism\n\nAdherents of consequentialism judge terrorism, like every other\npractice, solely by its consequences. Terrorism is not considered\nwrong in itself, but only if it has bad consequences on balance. The\ninnocence of the victims does not change that. This is an instance of\na general trait of consequentialism often highlighted by its critics,\nfor example in the debate about the moral justification of legal\npunishment. A standard objection to the consequentialist approach to\npunishment has been that it implies that punishment of the innocent is\njustified, when its consequences are good on balance. This objection\ncan only get off the ground because consequentialism denies that in\nsuch matters a person\u2019s innocence is morally significant in\nitself.\n\nThose who consider terrorism from a consequentialist point of view\ndiffer in their assessment of its morality. Their judgment on\nterrorism depends on their view of the good to be promoted by its use\nand on their assessment of the utility of terrorism as a means of\npromoting it. There is room for disagreement on both issues.\n2.2.1 Terrorism justified\n\nKai Nielsen approaches questions to do with political violence in\ngeneral and terrorism in particular as a consequentialist in ethics\nand a socialist in politics. The use of neither can be ruled out\ncategorically; it all depends on their utility as a method for\nattaining morally and politically worthwhile objectives such as\n\u201ca truly socialist society\u201d or liberation from colonial\nrule. \u201cWhen and where [either] should be employed is a tactical\nquestion that must be decided \u2026 on a case-by-case basis\n\u2026 like the choice of weapon in a war\u201d (Nielsen 1981:\n435). Nielsen has a wide definition of terrorism, but his examples\nshow that the innocence of the victims of terrorism makes no\ndifference to its justification\u2014that is, that his conclusions\napply to terrorism in both the wide and narrow sense. In his view,\n\nterrorist acts must be justified by their political effects and their\nmoral consequences. They are justified (1) when they are politically\neffective weapons in the revolutionary struggle and (2) when,\neverything considered, there are sound reasons for believing that, by\nthe use of that type of violence rather than no violence at all or\nviolence of some other type, there will be less injustice, suffering\nand degradation in the world than would otherwise have been the case\n(Nielsen 1981: 446).\n\n\nHistorical experience, in Nielsen\u2019s view, tells us that\nterrorism on a small scale, used as the sole method of struggle in\norder to provoke the masses into revolutionary action, is ineffective\nand often counterproductive. On the other hand, terrorism employed in\nconjunction with guerrilla warfare in a protracted war of liberation\nmay well prove useful and therefore also justified, as it did in\nAlgeria and South Vietnam. (For an earlier statement of the same view,\nsee Trotsky 1961: 48\u201359, 62\u201365.)\n2.2.2 Terrorism unjustified\n\nNicholas Fotion also uses a wide definition of terrorism. He, too, is\na consequentialist (although some of his remarks concerning the\ninnocence of many victims of terrorism might be more at home in\nnonconsequentialist ethics). But he finds standard consequentialist\nassessments of terrorism such as Nielsen\u2019s too permissive. If\nsome types of terrorism are justifiable under certain circumstances,\nsuch circumstances will be extremely rare. Terrorists and their\napologists do not perform the requisite calculations properly. One\nproblem is the \u201chigher good\u201d to be promoted by terrorism:\nmore often than not, it is defined in ideological terms, rather than\nderived from settled preferences or interests of actual people. But\nfor the most part Fotion discusses the issue of means. If a terrorist\nact or campaign is to be justified instrumentally, it must be shown\n(1) that the end sought is good enough to justify the means, (2) that\nthe end will indeed be achieved by means of terrorism, and (3) that\nthe end cannot be achieved in any other way that is morally and\notherwise less costly. Terrorists not only, as a matter of fact, fail\nto discharge this burden; Fotion argues that, with regard to terrorism\nthat victimizes innocent people, it cannot be discharged. All direct\nvictims of terrorism are treated as objects to be used\u2014indeed,\nused up\u2014by the terrorist. But\n\nin being treated as an object, the innocent victim is worse off than\nthe (alleged) guilty victim. Insofar as the latter is judged to have\ndone a wrong, he is thought of as a human. [\u2026] For the\nterrorist the innocent victim is neither a human in this judgmental\nsense nor a human in the sense of simply having value as a\nhuman being. Of course the terrorist needs to pick a human being as a\nvictim \u2026 because [that] brings about more terror \u2026 But\nthis does not involve treating them as humans. Rather, they\nare victimized and thereby treated as objects because they\nare humans (Fotion 1981: 464).\n\n\nIn reply, terrorists can claim that they advisedly sacrifice valued\nhuman beings for a higher good. But for this claim to carry any\nconviction, they would have to show that they have no alternative.\nYet, Fotion argues, they always have the alternative of\ntaking on the opponent\u2019s military establishment, and often also\nhave the option of going after government officials responsible for\nthe wrongs they object to, instead of attacking innocent persons. That\nkind of terrorism may sometimes be justified, whereas terrorism that\ntargets innocent people never is.\n2.3 Nonconsequentialism\n\nWithin a nonconsequentialist approach to morality, terrorism is\nconsidered wrong in itself, because of what it is, rather than only\nbecause (and insofar as) its consequences are bad on balance. But this\nis not to say that this approach leaves no room whatever for morally\njustifying certain acts or campaigns of terrorism. Indeed,\nnonconsequentialist discussions of terrorism also present a range of\npositions and arguments.\n\nA nonconsequentialist might try to justify an act or campaign of\nterrorism in one of two ways. One might invoke some deontological\nconsiderations, such as justice or rights, in favor of resorting to\nterrorism under certain circumstances. Alternatively, one might argue\nthat the obvious, and obviously very weighty, considerations of rights\n(of the victims of terrorism) and justice (which demands respect for\nthose rights) may sometimes be overridden by extremely weighty\nconsiderations of consequences\u2014an extremely high price that\nwould be paid for not resorting to terrorism. For the\nrejection of consequentialism is of course not tantamount to denying\nthat consequences of our actions, policies, and practices matter in\ntheir moral assessment; what is denied is the consequentialists\u2019\nclaim that only consequences matter.\n2.3.1 Basic human rights and distributive justice\n\nVirginia Held operates with a broad notion of terrorism, but her\njustification of terrorism is meant to apply to terrorism that targets\ncommon citizens. Her discussion of the subject focuses on the issue of\nrights. When rights of a person or group are not respected, what may\nwe do in order to ensure that they are? On one view, known as\nconsequentialism of rights, if the only way to ensure respect of a\ncertain right of A and B is to infringe the same\nright of C, we shall be justified in doing so. Held does not\nhold that such trade-offs in rights with the aim of maximizing their\nrespect in a society are appropriate. Yet rights sometimes come into\nconflict, whether directly or indirectly (as in the above example).\nWhen that happens, there is no way we can avoid comparing the rights\ninvolved as more or less stringent and making certain choices between\nthem. That applies to the case of terrorism too. Terrorism obviously\nviolates some human rights of its victims. But its advocates claim\nthat in some circumstances a limited use of terrorism is the only way\nof bringing about a society where human rights of all will be\nrespected.\n\nEven when this claim is true, that is not enough to make resort to\nterrorism justified. But it will be justified if an additional\ncondition is met: that of distributive justice. If there is a society\nwhere the human rights of a part of the population are respected,\nwhile the same rights of another part of the population are being\nviolated; if the only way of changing that and ensuring that human\nrights of all are respected is a limited use of terrorism; finally, if\nterrorism is directed against members of the first group, which up to\nnow has been privileged as far as respect of human rights is\nconcerned\u2014then terrorism will be morally justified. This is a\njustification in terms of distributive justice, applied to the problem\nof violations of human rights. It is more just to equalize the\nviolations of human rights in a stage of transition to a society where\nthe rights of all are respected, than to allow that the group which\nhas already suffered large-scale violations of human rights suffer\neven more such violations (assuming that in both cases we are dealing\nwith violations of the same, or equally stringent, human rights). The\nhuman rights of many are going to be violated in any case; it is more\njust, and therefore morally preferable, that their violations should\nbe distributed in a more equitable way (Held 2008).\n\nIt might be objected that in calling for sacrificing such basic human\nrights as the right to life and to bodily security of\nindividual victims of terrorism for the sake of a more just\ndistribution of violations of the same rights within a group\nin the course of transition to a stage where these rights will be\nrespected throughout that group, Held offends against the principles\nof separateness of persons and respect for persons (Primoratz 1997:\n230\u201331). In response, Held argues that\n\nto fail to achieve a more just distribution of violations of rights\n(through the use of terrorism if that is the only means available) is\nto fail to recognize that those whose rights are already not fairly\nrespected are individuals in their own right, not merely members of a\ngroup \u2026 whose rights can be ignored.\n\n\nAn argument for achieving a just distribution of rights violations is\nnot necessarily about groups; it can be an argument about the rights\nof individuals to fairness (Held 2008: 89\u201390). (For further\nobjections to Held\u2019s argument, see Steinhoff 2007: 125\u201330; Brooks 2010;\nNath 2011.)\n2.3.2 Supreme emergency and moral disaster\n\nIn Held\u2019s justification of terrorism, it is justice that\nrequires that inescapable violations of human rights be more evenly\ndistributed. There is a different way of allowing for the use of\nterrorism under certain circumstances within a nonconsequentialist\napproach to the ethics of violence. It could be argued that, as far as\njustice and rights are concerned, terrorism (or, in Held\u2019s\nterminology, the kind of terrorism that targets the innocent) is never\njustified. Furthermore, considerations of justice and rights carry\nmuch greater weight than considerations of good and bad consequences,\nand therefore normally trump the latter in cases of conflict. However,\nin exceptional circumstances considerations concerning\nconsequences\u2014the price of not resorting to\nterrorism\u2014may be so extremely weighty as to override those of\njustice and rights.\n\nMichael Walzer offers an argument along these lines in his discussion\nof \u201cterror bombing\u201d of German cities in World War II. In\nearly 1942, it seemed that Britain would be defeated by Germany and\nthat its military could not prevail while fighting in accordance with\nthe rules of war. Britain was the only remaining obstacle to the\nsubjugation of most of Europe by the Nazis. That was \u201can\nultimate threat to everything decent in our lives, an ideology and a\npractice of domination so murderous, so degrading even to those who\nmight survive, that the consequences of its final victory were\nliterally beyond calculation, immeasurably awful\u201d (Walzer 2000:\n253). Thus Britain was facing a \u201csupreme emergency\u201d: an\n(a) imminent threat of (b) something utterly unthinkable from a moral\npoint of view. In such an emergency\u2014a case of the \u201cdirty\nhands\u201d predicament that so often plagues political action (see\nWalzer 1973)\u2014one may breach a basic and weighty moral principle\nsuch as civilian immunity, if that is the only hope of fending off the\nthreat. So for more than three years, the RAF, later joined by the\nUSAAF, deliberately devastated many German cities, killed about\n600,000 civilians and seriously injured another 800,000 in an attempt\nto terrorize the German people into forcing their leadership to halt\nthe war and surrender unconditionally. By early 1943 it was clear that\nGermany was not going to win the war, and all subsequent terror\nbombing lacked moral justification. But in its first year, in\nWalzer\u2019s view, the terror bombing of Germany was morally\njustified as a response to the supreme emergency Britain was facing.\nWalzer then expands the notion of supreme emergency to apply to a\nsingle political community facing the threat of extermination or\nenslavement, and eventually to a single political community whose\n\u201csurvival and freedom\u201d are at stake. For \u201cthe\nsurvival and freedom of political communities\u2014whose members\nshare a way of life, developed by their ancestors, to be passed on to\ntheir children\u2014are the highest values of international\nsociety\u201d (Walzer 2000: 254).\n\nHere we have two different conceptions of supreme emergency. The\nthreat is imminent in both, but the nature of the threat differs: it\nis one thing to suffer the fate the Nazis had in store for peoples\nthey considered racially inferior, and another to have one\u2019s\npolity dismantled. By moving back and forth between these two types of\nsupreme emergency under the ambiguous heading of threat to \u201cthe\nsurvival and freedom of a political community\u201d, Walzer seeks to\nextend to the latter the moral response that might be appropriate to\nthe former. Yet whereas genocide, expulsion, or enslavement of an\nentire people might be thought a moral disaster that may be\nfended off by any means, its loss of political independence is, at\nmost, a political disaster. If a polity to be dismantled\nlacks moral legitimacy, its demise may well be a moral improvement.\nBut even if a polity does have moral legitimacy, a threat to its\n\u201csurvival and freedom\u201d falls short of \u201can ultimate\nthreat to everything decent in our lives\u201d. If so, its military\ncannot be justified in waging war on enemy civilians in order to\ndefend it. (On supreme emergencies see, for instance,\nStatman 2006; Kaplan 2011.)\n\nThere is another, less permissive position constructed along similar\nlines, but based on a more austere view of what counts as a moral\ndisaster that might justify resort to terrorism. Contrary to what many\nfighters against social or economic oppression, colonial rule, or\nforeign occupation believe, evils of such magnitude that they can\njustify indiscriminate killing and maiming of innocent people are\nextremely rare. Not every case of oppression, foreign rule, or\noccupation, however morally indefensible, amounts to a moral disaster\nin the relevant sense. Nor does every imminent threat to \u201cthe\nsurvival and freedom of a political community\u201d qualify, contrary\nto what Walzer has argued. However, if an entire people is subjected\nto extermination, or to an attempt at \u201cethnically\ncleansing\u201d it from its land, then it is facing a true moral\ndisaster and may properly consider terrorism as a method of struggle\nagainst such a fate. In view of their enormity and finality,\nextermination and \u201cethnic cleansing\u201d of an entire people\nconstitute a category apart. To be sure, resorting to terrorism in\nsuch a case will be morally justified only if there are very good\ngrounds for believing that terrorism will succeed where nothing else\nwill: in preventing imminent extermination or \u201cethnic\ncleansing\u201d, or stopping it if it is already under way. Cases\nwhere both conditions are met will be extremely rare. Indeed, history\nmay not offer a single example. But that does not mean that no\nact or campaign of terrorism could ever satisfy these conditions and\nthus turn out to be justified. Accordingly, terrorism is\nalmost absolutely wrong (Primoratz 2013: chapter 6).\n\nBoth the \u201csupreme emergency\u201d and the \u201cmoral\ndisaster\u201d view will justify a resort to terrorism only when that\nis the only way to deal with the emergency, or to prevent the\ndisaster, respectively. Just how certain must we be that terrorism\nwill indeed achieve the goal, while no other method will? One might\nargue that when in extremis, we cannot apply stringent\nepistemic standards in deciding how to cope\u2014indeed, if we cannot\nreally know what will work, we must take our chances with what might.\nThis is Walzer\u2019s view: in such a predicament, we must\n\u201cwager\u201d the crime of terrorism against the evil that is\notherwise in store for us. \u201cThere is no option; the risk\notherwise is too great\u201d (Walzer 2000: 259\u2013260). It may be\nobjected that this position highlights the enormity of the threat,\nwhile failing to give due weight to the enormity of the means proposed\nfor fending off the threat\u2014the enormity of terrorism, of\ndeliberately killing and maiming innocent people. When that is taken\ninto account, the conclusion may rather be that even in\nextremis, if terrorism is to be justified, the reasons for\nbelieving that it will work and that nothing else will must be very\nstrong indeed.\n2.3.3 Terrorism absolutely wrong\n\nSome hold that terrorism is absolutely wrong. This position, too,\ncomes in different versions. Some philosophers work with a wide\ndefinition of terrorism, and argue that under certain circumstances\n\u201cselective\u201d terrorism that targets only those seriously\nimplicated in the wrongs at issue may be justified (Corlett 2003,\nYoung 2004). This seems to suggest that terrorism which is not\nselective in this way\u2014that is, terrorism in the narrow\nsense\u2014is never justified. Yet this does not follow: there is\nstill room for arguing that terrorism of the latter type can be\njustified by further considerations, such as those of \u201csupreme\nemergency\u201d or \u201cmoral disaster\u201d.\n\nPer Bauhn does not leave it at that. He attempts to show that\nterrorism that targets non-combatants or common citizens can never be\njustified by deploying a slightly amended version of Alan\nGewirth\u2019s ethical theory. Freedom and safety are fundamental\nprerequisites of action and therefore must be accorded paramount\nweight. The need to protect them generates a range of rights; the\nright pertinent here is \u201can absolute right not to be made the\nintended victims of a homicidal project\u201d all innocent persons\nhave (Gewirth 1981: 16). When the absolute status of this right is\nchallenged by invoking supreme emergency or moral disaster, Bauhn\nargues that there is a moral difference between what we are positively\nand directly causally responsible for, and what we are causally\nresponsible for only indirectly, by failing to prevent other persons\nfrom intentionally bringing it about. We are morally responsible for\nthe former, but (except in certain special circumstances) not for the\nlatter. If we refuse to resort to terrorism in order not to target\ninnocent persons, and thus fail to prevent some other persons from\nperpetrating atrocities, it is only the perpetrators who will be\nmorally responsible for those atrocities. Therefore we must refuse\n(Bauhn 1989: chapter 5).\n\nSome philosophers base their absolute rejection of terrorism on the\nslippery slope argument, and argue that \u201cthe appeal to supreme\nemergency is too dangerous to be allowed as a publicly available\nvindication for terrorism, no matter how rare the circumstances are\nmeant to be\u201d (Coady 2021: 143\u201344).\n\nStephen Nathanson seeks to ground the absolute immunity of civilians\nor common citizens and the absolute prohibition of terrorism which it\nentails in a rule-consequentialist ethical theory (Nathanson 2010:\n191\u2013208). Adopting civilian immunity, rather than adopting any\nother rule regulating the matter or having no rule at all, is the best\nway to reduce the killing and destruction in armed conflict. Moreover,\nthe best consequences will be achieved by adopting it as an absolute\nrule, rather than as a rule allowing for exceptions in supreme\nemergencies. The idea of supreme emergency is vague. The criteria for\nproffering supreme emergency exemptions are liable to be applied in\narbitrary and subjective ways. Finally, there is the slippery slope\nargument: \u201cpermitting [departures from the rule of civilian\nimmunity, including terrorism] even under the direst circumstances\nwill lower the bar for justifying such acts \u2026 broadcast the\nmessage that such behavior may sometimes be justified and \u2026\nthus lend its weight to increasing the use of such methods\u201d\n(Nathanson 2010: 207).\n\nHowever, one can adopt rule-consequentialism as one\u2019s ethical\ntheory and yet view the immunity of civilians or common citizens and\nthe attendant prohibition of terrorism as very stringent, but not\nabsolute moral rules. Thus Richard B. Brandt and Brad Hooker do not\nview this immunity as absolute. They argue that a set of moral rules\nselected because of the good consequences of their adoption should\ninclude a rule that allows and indeed requires one to prevent disaster\neven if that means breaking some other moral rule. Even such a\nstringent moral rule as the prohibition of deliberate use of violence\nagainst innocent people may be overridden, if the disaster that cannot\nbe prevented in any other way is grave enough. (See Brandt 1992:\n87\u201388, 150\u201351, 156\u201357; Hooker 2000: 98\u201399,\n127\u201336). There is thus some convergence at the level of\npractical conclusions between their understanding of the immunity of\ncivilians or common citizens and the \u201cmoral disaster\u201d\nposition outlined above (2.3.2).\n",
