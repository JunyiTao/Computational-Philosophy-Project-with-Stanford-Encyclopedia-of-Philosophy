    "main_text": "\n\nIn our everyday lives, we confront a host of moral issues. Once we\nhave deliberated and formed judgments about what is right or\nwrong, good or bad, these judgments tend to\nhave a marked hold on us. Although in the end, we do not always behave\nas we think we ought, our moral judgments typically motivate us, at\nleast to some degree, to act in accordance with them. When\nphilosophers talk about moral motivation, this is the basic phenomenon\nthat they seek to understand. Moral motivation is an instance of a\nmore general phenomenon\u2014what we might call normative\nmotivation\u2014for our other normative judgments also typically\nhave some motivating force. When we make the normative judgment that\nsomething is good for us, or that we have a reason\nto act in a particular way, or that a specific course of action is the\nrational course, we also tend to be moved. Many philosophers\nhave regarded the motivating force of normative judgments as the key\nfeature that marks them as normative, thereby distinguishing\nthem from the many other judgments we make. In contrast to our\nnormative judgments, our mathematical and empirical judgments, for\nexample, seem to have no intrinsic connection to motivation and\naction. The belief that an antibiotic will cure a specific infection\nmay move an individual to take the antibiotic, if she also believes\nthat she has the infection, and if she either desires to be cured or\njudges that she ought to treat the infection for her own good. All on\nits own, however, an empirical belief like this one appears to carry\nwith it no particular motivational impact; a person can judge that an\nantibiotic will most effectively cure a specific infection without\nbeing moved one way or another. \n\nAlthough motivating force may be a distinguishing feature of normative\njudgments, the phenomenon of normative motivation seems most\nsignificant in the case of narrowly moral judgments. Moral\nmotivation has, in any case, received far greater attention than\nmotivation in connection with other normative judgments. Morality is\nwidely believed to conflict, frequently and sometimes severely, with\nwhat an agent most values or most prefers to do. Perhaps because of\nthe apparent opposition between self-interest and morality, the fact\nof moral motivation has seemed especially puzzling. How is it that we\nare so reliably moved by our moral judgments? And what is the precise\nnature of the connection between moral judgment and motivation? Of\ncourse, the less puzzling and more mundane moral motivation comes to\nseem, the more puzzling failures of moral motivation become.\nIf we are to explain moral motivation, we will need to understand not\nonly how moral judgments so regularly succeed in motivating, but how\nthey can fail to motivate, sometimes rather spectacularly. Not only do\nwe witness motivational failure among the deranged, dejected, and\nconfused, but also, it appears, among the fully sound and\nself-possessed. What are we to make of the\n\u201camoralist\u201d\u2014the apparently rational, strong willed\nindividual who seemingly makes moral judgments, while remaining\nutterly indifferent? \n\nIn answering the foregoing questions, philosophers have been led to\nsharply differing views about moral motivation, and these views have\nsometimes been thought to have important implications for foundational\nissues in ethics. More precisely, differing views about moral\nmotivation involve commitment to particular theses which have been\nthought to bear on questions about moral semantics and the nature of\nmorality. Perhaps most famously, certain theses have been jointly\ndeployed to support skeptical or anti-realist views in\nmetaethics. This entry provides an overview of the main positions\nphilosophers have taken in their efforts to understand and explain the\nphenomenon of moral motivation. It also briefly explains how key\ntheses concerning moral motivation have come to inform and structure\ndebates about moral semantics and the nature of morality.\n",
