    "main_text": "Philosophy of Language, Interpretation, and Translation || Theory of Interpretation (Hermeneutics)\n4.2 Theory of Interpretation (Hermeneutics)\n\nHerder\u2019s theories of interpretation and translation both rest on\na certain epoch-making insight of his: Whereas such eminent\nEnlightenment philosopher-historians as Hume and Voltaire had normally\nstill held that, as Hume put it, \u201cmankind are so much the same\nin all times and places that history informs us of nothing new or\nstrange\u201d (1748: section VIII, part I, 65), Herder discovered, or\nat least saw more clearly than anyone before him, that this was false,\nthat peoples from different historical periods and cultures vary\ntremendously in their concepts, beliefs, values, (perceptual\nand affective) sensations, and so forth. He also recognized that\nsimilar, albeit usually less dramatic, variations occur even between\nindividuals within a single period and culture. These positions are\nprominent in many of Herder\u2019s works (see, e.g., On the\nChange of Taste [1766], This Too a Philosophy of\nHistory, and On the Cognition and Sensation). Let us\ncall them together his principle of radical mental\ndifference.\n\nHerder in effect strives to develop a perfectly general theory of\ninterpretation (or achieving understanding), as Schleiermacher later\nwould \u2013 a theory that covers both texts and discourse, ancient\nas well as modern, sacred as well as profane, artistic as well as\nnon-artistic, and so on. Indeed, in one important respect, his theory\nis even more general than Schleiermacher\u2019s would be: its\ninclusion of non-linguistic art (sculpture, painting, instrumental\nmusic, etc.). \n\nGiven the principle of radical mental difference, and the gulf that\nconsequently often initially divides an interpreter\u2019s own\nthought from that of the person whom he wants to interpret,\ninterpretation is often an extremely difficult task,\nrequiring extraordinary efforts on the part of the interpreter. (See\nin this connection, e.g., Herder\u2019s discussion of interpreting\nancient Hebrew in Treatise on the Origin.)\n\nIn particular, the interpreter often faces, and needs to resist, a\ntemptation falsely to assimilate the thought that he is\ninterpreting to someone else\u2019s, especially his own. (This theme\nis prominent in This Too a Philosophy of History, for\ninstance.)\n\nHow, given these challenges, is the interpreter supposed to achieve\naccurate interpretation? Herder\u2019s answer comprises several\npoints:\n\nHis three theses in the philosophy of language undergird his whole\ntheory of interpretation and entail certain parts of the answer to the\nquestion just raised. It is an implication of his thesis that all\nthought is essentially dependent on and bounded by language that an\ninterpreted subject\u2019s language is in a certain sense bound to be\na reliable indicator of the nature of his thought, so that the\ninterpreter at least need not worry that the interpreted subject might\nbe entertaining ineffable thoughts or thoughts whose character is\nsystematically distorted by his expression of them in language. It is\nan implication of Herder\u2019s thesis that meaning consists in\nword-usage that interpretation essentially and fundamentally requires\npinning down an interpreted subject\u2019s word-usages, and thereby\nhis meanings. Finally, it is an implication of Herder\u2019s\nquasi-empiricist thesis concerning concepts that an\ninterpreter\u2019s understanding of an interpreted subject\u2019s\nconcepts must include some sort of recapturing of their basis in the\ninterpreted subject\u2019s sensations.\n\nHerder also espouses three further important principles in\ninterpretation-theory that contribute to answering the question raised\nabove:\n\nA principle of secularism in interpretation: Contrary to a\npractice that was still common in Herder\u2019s day in relation to\nthe Bible, the interpretation of texts must never rely on religious\nassumptions or means, even when the texts are sacred ones, but must\ninstead rely only on secular ones. (This principle is already\nprominent in Herder\u2019s writings on biblical interpretation from\nthe 1760s.) Relatedly, the temptation to give allegorical\ninterpretations of sacred texts must be resisted, except in those\nrelatively few cases, such as the parables of the New Testament, where\nthey are clearly warranted by the text (see esp. Songs of\nLove from 1778).\n\nA principle of generic interpretation. In addition to the\nnature of a work\u2019s meanings, interpretation must also identify\nthe nature of its genre (i.e., roughly, a certain set of\ngeneral purposes and rules that it aspires to realize and conform to).\nAs in the case of meanings, genres vary from age to age, culture to\nculture, and even individual to individual, and the interpreter\ntherefore faces, and needs to resist, constant temptations falsely to\nassimilate a work\u2019s genre to others with which he happens to be\nmore familiar (for example, Shakespearean \u201ctragedy\u201d to\nSophoclean \u201ctragedy\u201d, or vice versa). (This principle is\nalready prominent in the Critical Forests from 1769, but\nfinds its classic statement in the essay Shakespeare from\n1773.)\n\nA principle of methodological empiricism in interpretation:\nInterpretation must always be based on, and kept faithful to, exact\nobservations of relevant linguistic (and other) evidence. This applies\nwhen the interpreter investigates word-usages in order to discover\nmeanings (a point that is already prominent in the\nFragments); when he attempts to pin down a work\u2019s\ngenre, or the purposes and rules that constitute it (see esp.\nShakespeare); and (to anticipate a bit) when he makes\nconjectures about an author\u2019s individual psychology (see esp.\nOn Thomas Abbt\u2019s Writings from 1768).\n\nSo far, these principles will probably seem sensible enough. But\nbeyond them, Herder also advances a further set of interpretive\nprinciples that are likely to sound much more touchy-feely at first\nhearing (the first of them, Einf\u00fchlung, rather literally\nso!). However, I want to suggest that on the contrary they are in fact\nquite hard-nosed.\n\nHerder proposes (prominently in This Too a Philosophy of\nHistory, for instance) that the way to bridge radical mental\ndifference when interpreting is through Einf\u00fchlung,\n\u201cfeeling one\u2019s way in\u201d. This proposal has often been\nthought (for example, by Friedrich Meinecke) to mean that the\ninterpreter should perform some sort of psychological self-projection\nonto texts. However, that is not Herder\u2019s main idea\nhere\u2014for making it so would amount to advocating just the sort\nof distorting assimilation of the thought in a text to one\u2019s own\nthat he is above all concerned to avoid. As can be seen from\nThis Too a Philosophy of History, what he mainly has in mind\nis instead a rather arduous process of historical-philological\ninquiry. What, though, more specifically, is the cash value of his\nmetaphor of Einf\u00fchlung? It has at least five components,\nwhich are quite various in nature but consistent with each other and\nall quite sensible and deep: (1) First of all, the metaphor implies\n(once again) that the interpreter typically faces a radical\ndifference, a gulf, between his own mentality and that of the\ninterpreted subject, making interpretation a difficult, laborious task\n(it implies that there is an \u201cin\u201d there that the\ninterpreter must carefully and laboriously \u201cfeel his way\ninto\u201d). (2) The metaphor also implies more specifically\n(This Too a Philosophy of History shows) that the\n\u201cfeeling one\u2019s way in\u201d should include thorough\nresearch not only into a text\u2019s use of language but also into\nits whole geographical, historical, and social context. (3) It also\nimplies a claim\u2014based on Herder\u2019s quasi-empiricist theory\nof concepts\u2014that in order to understand an interpreted\nsubject\u2019s language the interpreter must achieve an imaginative\nreproduction of his (perceptual and affective) sensations. (4) It also\nimplies (This Too a Philosophy of History again shows) that\nhostility in an interpreter toward the people whom he interprets will\ngenerally distort his interpretation, and should therefore be avoided.\n(Herder, though, is equally opposed to excessive\nidentification with them for the same reason.) (5) Finally,\nit also implies that the interpreter should strive to develop his\ngrasp of linguistic usage, contextual facts, and relevant sensations\nto the point where this achieves something like the same immediacy and\nautomaticness that it had for a text\u2019s original author and\naudience when they understood the text in light of such\nfactors (so that it acquires for him, as it had for them, the\nphenomenology more of a feeling than a cognition).\n\nHerder also insists (for example, in the Critical Forests) on\na principle of holism in interpretation. This principle rests\non several motives, including the following: (1) Parts of a text taken\nin isolation are typically ambiguous in various ways (in relation to\nbackground linguistic possibilities). In order to resolve such\nambiguities, an interpreter needs the guidance provided by surrounding\ntext. (2) That problem arises once a range of possible\nlinguistic meanings is established for a piece of text. But in the\ncase of a text that is separated from the interpreter by radical\nmental difference, knowledge of such a range itself presents a\nproblem. How is he to pin down the range of possible meanings, i.e.,\npossible usages, for a word? This requires a collation of the\nword\u2019s actual uses and an inference from these to the rules that\ngovern them, i.e., to their usages, a collation that in turn requires\nlooking to remoter contexts in which the same word occurs (other parts\nof the text, other works in the author\u2019s corpus, works by his\ncontemporaries, etc.), or in short: holism. (3) Authors typically\nwrite a work as a whole, conveying ideas not only in its\nparticular parts but also through the way in which these fit together\nto make up a whole. Consequently, readings that fail to interpret the\nwork as a whole will miss essential aspects of its meaning\u2014both\nthe ideas in question themselves and meanings of the particular parts\non which they shed important light.\n\nSuch holism in interpretation (like the holism of taking into account\na whole geographical, historical, and social context) may seem to lead\nto a certain circularity: in order to interpret the part one needs to\ntake into account the whole, but equally, in order to grasp the whole\none needs to understand its parts. Herder agrees about this, but he\nconsiders the circularity involved benign. Specifically, he recommends\ninterpreting parts in a provisional way in light of a general\nknowledge of the language in order thereby to generate a provisional\ninterpretation of the whole, then applying this provisional\ninterpretation of the whole in order to refine the interpretation of\neach of the parts, and so on, back and forth, indefinitely (see again\nthe Critical Forests). This might seem like a mere\npseudo-solution, but it is not: the key insight on which it implicitly\nrests is that understanding is not an all-or-nothing matter but\ninstead something that comes in degrees. \n\nIn On Thomas Abbt\u2019s Writings, On the Cognition and\nSensation, and elsewhere Herder makes one of his most important\nand influential innovations: interpretation must supplement its focus\non word-usage with attention to the author\u2019s\npsychology. Herder implies several reasons for this (some of\nwhich would subsequently be developed more explicitly and elaborately\nby successors such as Schleiermacher and Friedrich Schlegel): (1) As\nwas already mentioned, he embraces a quasi-empiricist theory of\nconcepts that entails that in order to understand an author\u2019s\nconcepts an interpreter must imaginatively recapture the\nauthor\u2019s relevant sensations. (2) As Quentin Skinner has\nrecently emphasized, understanding the linguistic meaning of an\nutterance or text is only a necessary, not a sufficient, condition for\nunderstanding the utterance/text tout court; in addition, one\nneeds to discover what might nowadays be called the author\u2019s\nillocutionary intentions. For example, I meet a\nstranger by a frozen lake who tells me, \u201cThe ice is thin over\nthere\u201d; I understand his linguistic meaning perfectly; but is he\nsimply informing me?, warning me?, threatening me?, joking? \u2026\n(3) Skinner himself tends to imply that one can determine linguistic\nmeanings prior to establishing authorial intentions. That may\nsometimes be so (e.g., in the example just given). But is it\ngenerally so? Herder implies not. And this seems right,\nbecause the linguistic meaning of a formula is often ambiguous (in\nterms of the background linguistic possibilities), and in order to\nidentify the relevant meaning one must turn, not only to larger bodies\nof text (as was already mentioned), but also to hypotheses, largely\nderived from them, concerning the author\u2019s intentions (e.g.,\nconcerning the subject-matter that he intends to treat). This is a\nfurther reason why interpreters need to invoke psychology. (4) As was\nalready mentioned, Herder implies that an author often conveys ideas\nin his work, not explicitly in its parts, but rather via these and the\nway in which they are put together to form a textual whole. It is\nnecessary for the interpreter to capture these ideas, both for their\nown sake and in order thereby to resolve ambiguities at the level of\nthe parts. (5) Herder also implies that the second half of his\ndoctrine of radical mental difference\u2014individual\nvariations in mode of thought even within a single period and\nculture\u2014generates a need for psychological interpretation. Why\ndoes any special need arise here? Part of the answer seems to be that\nwhen an interpreter is dealing with a concept that is distinctive of a\nparticular author rather than common to a whole period/culture, he\ntypically faces a problem of relative paucity and lack of\ncontextual variety in the actual uses of the word that are\navailable as empirical evidence from which to infer the rule for use,\nor usage, constitutive of its meaning. Hence he needs extra\nhelp\u2014and the author\u2019s general psychology may provide this.\n(Points (2) and (5) would subsequently be elaborated by\nSchleiermacher, point (4) by Schlegel.)\n\nIn the same works Herder also indicates that interpretation,\nespecially in its psychological aspect, requires the interpreter to\nuse \u201cdivination\u201d. This is another principle that is liable\nto sound disturbingly touchy-feely at first hearing\u2014in\nparticular, it can sound as though Herder means some sort of prophetic\nprocess endowed with a religious basis and perhaps even infallibility.\nHowever, what he really has in mind here is instead, quite differently\nand far more sensibly, a process of hypothesis, based on the meager\nempirical evidence that is available, but also going well beyond it,\nand therefore vulnerable to subsequent falsification, and abandonment\nor revision if falsified. (Etymologically, the French word \u201cdeviner\u201d,\nto guess/conjecture is relevant here.)\n\nHerder also implies an additional important point concerning the\ngeneral nature of interpretation: After him, the question would be\nexplicitly raised whether interpretation is a science or an art.\nHerder does not himself explicitly raise or address this question. But\nhis strong inclination would clearly be to say that interpretation is\nlike rather than unlike natural science; see, e.g., already\nOn Thomas Abbt\u2019s Writings. He has several reasons for\nthinking so: (1) He assumes (as indeed did virtually everyone at this\nperiod) that the meaning of an author\u2019s text is as much an\nobjective matter as the subjects investigated by the natural\nscientist. (2) The difficulty of interpretation that results\nfrom radical mental difference, and the consequent need for a\nmethodologically sophisticated and painstaking\napproach to interpretation in many cases, make for further points of\nsimilarity between interpretation and natural science. (3) The\nessential role of \u201cdivination\u201d, qua hypothesis,\nin interpretation constitutes yet a further point of similarity\nbetween interpretation and natural science. Moreover, (4) even the\nsubject-matter of interpretation is not, in Herder\u2019s view,\nsharply different from that dealt with by natural science: the latter\ninvestigates observable physical processes in nature in order to\ndetermine the forces that underlie and produce them, but, similarly,\ninterpretation investigates observable human verbal (and non-verbal)\nphysical behavior in order to determine the forces that underlie and\nproduce it (Herder explicitly identifying mental conditions,\nsuch as conceptual understanding, as \u201cforces\u201d).\n\nFinally, Herder also has a set of sophisticated and attractive reasons\nwhy accurate interpretation of the sort that he aims at is important.\nThese include (1) the intrinsic interest of the ideas of historical\nand cultural Others thereby discovered, (2) the cosmopolitan respect\nthat striving to understand them accurately both evinces and\nencourages, (3) the possibility of thereby discovering ideas different\nfrom our own which we can incorporate into our own perspective in\norder to improve it in various ways (e.g., ideas concerning morals or\nart), and (4) the possibility of thereby enhancing not only our\nunderstanding but also our self-understanding, namely, by\ncoming to see in the light of comparisons what is distinctive of our\nown perspective and what not, and by coming to see how it has\ndeveloped historically out of earlier perspectives. \n\nHerder\u2019s theory of interpretation had an enormous and beneficial\nimpact on subsequent hermeneutics. His theory was taken over almost\nwholesale by Schleiermacher in his much more famous lectures on\nhermeneutics, delivered during the first third of the nineteenth\ncentury. In particular, such fundamental and famous positions in\nSchleiermacher\u2019s hermeneutics as his supplementing of\n\u201clinguistic\u201d with \u201cpsychological\u201d\ninterpretation and his identification of \u201cdivination\u201d as\nthe main method of the latter are due entirely to Herder. Moreover,\nwhere Herder and Schleiermacher do occasionally disagree\nconcerning interpretation, Herder\u2019s position almost always turns\nout to be philosophically superior on reflection.\n\nBy decisively influencing Schleiermacher\u2019s hermeneutic theory\nHerder also exercised an indirect decisive influence on that of\nSchleiermacher\u2019s great pupil August Boeckh, whose\nEncyclopedia and Methodology of the Philological Sciences\n(posthumously published in 1877) essentially reproduced\nSchleiermacher\u2019s theory with only modest elaborations, and\nbecame the standard methodological work for classical scholars and\nothers. Moreover, Boeckh\u2019s one significant departure from\nSchleiermacher\u2019s theory, namely, his addition of\ngeneric (i.e., genre-focused) interpretation to the several\naspects of interpretation that Schleiermacher had already\ndistinguished, in effect simply reincorporated the strong emphasis\nthat Herder had already placed on this.\n",
