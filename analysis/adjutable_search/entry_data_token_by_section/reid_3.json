    "main_text": "Conception || Conceiving\n2.1 Conceiving\n\nConception lies at the heart of the operations of the intellectual\nfaculties because conception provides the intentional\ncontent\u2014the \u2018aboutness\u2019\u2014to mental states. Reid\ndistinguishes between several functions of conception. A rudimentary\nform of conceiving, which Reid often calls \u2018simple apprehension,\u2019\nrefers to \u201cthe bare conception of a thing without any judgment\nor belief about it\u201d (EIP 4.1, 295). This \u201centers as an\ningredient in every operation of the mind\u201d (EIP 4.1, 296). In\norder to believe, or remember or perceive, I must perform an act of\nsimple apprehension in order to get something in mind. \n\n\nWe explain Reidian conception by contrast with the Way of\nIdeas. First, Reid presupposes that the mind has an irreducible\ncapacity for intentional conception in which our mental states are\nuniquely about specific objects. This faculty cannot be explained in\nterms of further non-intentional states. How intentional conception\ncan be explained is mysterious\u2014Reid is well aware of this. Yet\nif \u201cwe were unable to give any account how we first got the\nconception of power, this would be no good reason for denying that we\nhave it\u201d (Reid 2001, \u201cOf Power,\u201d 5). In a\ncontrasting methodological move, Hume suggests that intentional\ncontent through ideas is built up from the operation of the laws of\nassociation\u2014contiguity in time and space, resemblance and\nperceived causation\u2014working upon impressions and images in the\nmind (see Treatise 1.1.1.7, 4; 1.2.3.2, 33; 2.1.11.8,\n319; Enquiry 7.2.6, 74).\n\n \nConception takes as its intentional objects items with varied\nontologies, including physical objects and propositions (EIP 1.1,\n24\u20135) as well as fictional beings like Brienne of Tarth. The fact that\nconception takes physical objects as (direct) intentional objects\nmarks a key contrast with the Way of Ideas since, on the Way of Ideas,\nconception, perception, judgment and belief are \u201conly different\nways of perceiving ideas in our own minds\u201d (EIP 4.1, 298). (Note\nthat, according to Reid, the Way of Ideas fails to adopt a proper\nfaculty psychology since all mental powers\u2014memory, perception,\nabstraction, etc.\u2014only ever take ideas as intentional objects.)\nConsiderable work in the secondary literature has been devoted to\ndetermine just what the content of conceptions are or can be.\n\n \nThe state of conception is not a \u2018quantitative\u2019 state for Reid, as are\nideas according to Hume, who writes that some ideas are lively, others\nnot, and others partially lively (Treatise 1.1.1). Hume uses\nthese valences to determine which faculty is at work conceiving the\nidea. If I perceive an idea of a tree, my conception is lively and\nvivacious. If I remember the same idea of a tree, my conception is\nfaint. Instead, Reid offers an account of a distinct\nfaculty\u2014conception\u2014whose objects are embedded in other\nacts of the intellectual powers.\n\n\nReid's is an act-based theory of conception, in contrast to the Way of\nIdeas' object-based theory. Conceptions are ways of being aware of\nobjects. To conceive of an object is to be aware of that\nobject as the bearer of some particular property. So I can\nconceive that Brienne of Tarth is tall, or that Brienne\nof Tarth is female, or that Brienne of Tarth is a tall\nfemale. Being tall and being female are different properties, and\ntheir difference signals something important about Reidian\nconception. Being tall is a relational property since height is a\ntrait that is assessed relative to some further thing or standard. To\nforeshadow, this subtle feature of conception will become important\nfor Reid in his discussion of vision, especially his discussion of the\nrelational property of visible figure.\n",
