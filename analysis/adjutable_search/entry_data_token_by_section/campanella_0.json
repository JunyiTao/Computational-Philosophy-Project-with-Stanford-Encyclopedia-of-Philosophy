    "main_text": "Biographical Sketch\n1. Biographical Sketch\n\nTommaso Campanella was born in Stilo, a town in Calabria, one of the\nsouthern regions of Italy, on September 5, 1568. At the age of 14 he\nentered the Dominican Order. In 1588, while in Cosenza, another\nCalabrian town, he read the treatise De rerum natura iuxta\npropriis principiis (On the Nature of Things According to\nTheir Own Principles, 1586) by Bernardino\nTelesio; and in the following months Campanella wrote his own\nPhilosophia sensibus demonstrata (Philosophy as\nDemonstrated by the Senses) in defense of this new philosophy of\nnature. In 1590 he was in Naples, where he made the acquaintance of\nGiambattista della Porta. He left for Rome in 1592 and then went to\nFlorence and Padua, where he met Galileo. Denounced to the\nInquisition, Campanella was arrested at the beginning of 1594 and in\nOctober was transferred to the Inquisition\u2019s prison in Rome. Condemned\non suspicion of heresy and forced to abjure, at the end of 1597 he was\nordered to return to Calabria. In the summer of 1598 he was again in\nStilo, where he soon became the inspiration behind a vast conspiracy\nagainst the Spanish, who at that time governed the Kingdom of Naples.\nIn August 1599 two of the conspirators revealed the plot to the\nSpanish viceroy, who sent armed forces into Calabria to repress it.\nCampanella was imprisoned and in November was moved to Naples, where\nhe was tried for heresy and rebellion. He managed to avoid the death\npenalty by feigning madness and was instead condemned to a lengthy\ndetention in various Neapolitan fortresses. During the years of his\nincarceration, he dedicated himself to intense literary activity,\ncomposing his most famous works, aimed at producing a new foundation\nfor the entire encyclopedia of knowledge. In 1612 he was visited by\nTobias Adami, a German man of letters from Saxony who took it upon\nhimself to publish some of Campanella\u2019s most important writings in\nFrankfurt from 1617 to 1623. After almost 27 years in prison,\nCampanella was released from the Castel Nuovo in 1626 and arrived in\nRome, where he remained in detention until early 1629. In October 1634\nhe was compelled to go into exile in France, following renewed Spanish\nsuspicions regarding him. In Paris he was received with favor by King\nLouis XIII and by Cardinal Richelieu and was able to frequent learned\ncircles. He wrote new political works and arranged for the printing of\nthe first volumes of his Opera omnia, a project that remained\nincomplete at his death on May 21, 1639.\n",
