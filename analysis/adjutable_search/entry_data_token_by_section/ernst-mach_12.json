    "main_text": "Physics\n5. Physics\n\n\nJust as the early Mach was influenced by the revolutions in\npsychology and biology, the mature Mach was deeply involved in the\nrevolutions in physics, though remaining a critic of the new physics\njust as much as he had been of the old. Both Planck and Einstein\npaid their homage to the person who created a culture of critique\nwithin which they developed their ideas. They also came to\ncriticize what they saw as his stubborn refusal to accept their new\nideas.\n\n\nTo twentieth philosophy, Mach is best known as a positivist who\ninfluenced Logical Positivism, a philosopher of physics who influenced\nEinstein, and an empiricist who denied the reality of atoms. None of\nthis is incorrect, but to understand Mach as limited to physics is a\nhuge mistake. Mach\u2019s influence upon physics and its philosophy was\nenormous; the mistake has been to not understand the roots of Mach\u2019s\nideas, a mistake which took place early in the twentieth century as a\nnew brand of positivism/empiricism entered the scene (one which turned\naway from the life sciences as the scientific driving force of\npositivist epistemology and focused on the new developments in the\nfoundations of physics and logic). This encyclopedia has several\nentries on the history and philosophy of physics (see links below)\nwhich detail Mach\u2019s ideas, contributions, and influences (in\nparticular, his famous critique of Newtonian Absolute Space and Time,\nas well as his relationship to Einstein). What follows is a placement\nof his ideas within the context of his larger thought.\n",
