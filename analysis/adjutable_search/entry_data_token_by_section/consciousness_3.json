    "main_text": "Concepts of Consciousness || State consciousness\n2.2 State consciousness\n\n\nThe notion of a conscious mental state also has a variety of\ndistinct though perhaps interrelated meanings. There are at least six\nmajor options.\n\nStates one is aware of. On one common reading, a conscious\nmental state is simply a mental state one is aware of being in\n(Rosenthal 1986, 1996). Conscious states in this sense involve a form\nof meta-mentality or meta-intentionality in so far as\nthey require mental states that are themselves about mental states. To\nhave a conscious desire for a cup of coffee is to have such a desire\nand also to be simultaneously and directly aware that one has such a\ndesire. Unconscious thoughts and desires in this sense are simply\nthose we have without being aware of having them, whether our lack of\nself-knowledge results from simple inattention or more deeply\npsychoanalytic causes.\n\nQualitative states. States might also be regarded as\nconscious in a seemingly quite different and more qualitative\nsense. That is, one might count a state as conscious just if it has or\ninvolves qualitative or experiential properties of the sort often\nreferred to as \u201cqualia\u201d or \u201craw sensory feels\u201d.\n(See the entry on\n qualia.)\n One's perception of the Merlot one is drinking or of the fabric one\nis examining counts as a conscious mental state in this sense because\nit involves various sensory qualia, e.g., taste qualia in the wine\ncase and color qualia in one's visual experience of the cloth. There\nis considerable disagreement about the nature of such qualia\n(Churchland 1985, Shoemaker 1990, Clark 1993, Chalmers 1996) and even\nabout their existence. Traditionally qualia have been regarded as\nintrinsic, private, ineffable monadic features of experience, but\ncurrent theories of qualia often reject at least some of those\ncommitments (Dennett 1990).\n\nPhenomenal states. Such qualia are sometimes referred to as\nphenomenal properties and the associated sort of consciousness as\nphenomenal consciousness, but the latter term is perhaps more\nproperly applied to the overall structure of experience and involves\nfar more than sensory qualia. The phenomenal structure of consciousness\nalso encompasses much of the spatial, temporal and conceptual\norganization of our experience of the world and of ourselves as agents\nin it (see section\n 4.3).\n It is therefore probably\nbest, at least initially, to distinguish the concept of phenomenal\nconsciousness from that of qualitative consciousness, though they no\ndoubt overlap.\n\nWhat-it-is-like states. Consciousness in both those senses\nlinks up as well with Thomas Nagel's (1974) notion of a conscious\ncreature, insofar as one might count a mental state as conscious in the\n\u201cwhat it is like\u201d sense just if there is something\nthat it is like to be in that state. Nagel's criterion might be\nunderstood as aiming to provide a first-person or internal conception\nof what makes a state a phenomenal or qualitative state.\n\nAccess consciousness. States might be conscious in a\nseemingly quite different access sense, which has more to do with\nintra-mental relations. In this respect, a state's being conscious is a\nmatter of its availability to interact with other states and of the\naccess that one has to its content. In this more functional sense,\nwhich corresponds to what Ned Block (1995) calls access\nconsciousness, a visual state's being conscious is not so much a\nmatter of whether or not it has a qualitative \u201cwhat it's\nlikeness\u201d, but of whether or not it and the visual information\nthat it carries is generally available for use and guidance by the\norganism. In so far as the information in that state is richly and\nflexibly available to its containing organism, then it counts as a\nconscious state in the relevant respect, whether or not it has any\nqualitative or phenomenal feel in the Nagel sense.\n\nNarrative consciousness. States might also be regarded as\nconscious in a narrative sense that appeals to the notion of\nthe \u201cstream of consciousness\u201d, regarded as an ongoing more\nor less serial narrative of episodes from the perspective of an actual\nor merely virtual self. The idea would be to equate the person's\nconscious mental states with those that appear in the stream (Dennett\n1991, 1992).\n\n\nAlthough these six notions of what makes a state conscious can be\nindependently specified, they are obviously not without potential\nlinks, nor do they exhaust the realm of possible options. Drawing\nconnections, one might argue that states appear in the stream of\nconsciousness only in so far as we are aware of them, and thus forge a\nbond between the first meta-mental notion of a conscious state and the\nstream or narrative concept. Or one might connect the access with the\nqualitative or phenomenal notions of a conscious state by trying to\nshow that states that represent in those ways make their contents\nwidely available in the respect required by the access notion.\n\n\nAiming to go beyond the six options, one might distinguish conscious\nfrom nonconscious states by appeal to aspects of their intra-mental\ndynamics and interactions other than mere access relations; e.g.,\nconscious states might manifest a richer stock of content-sensitive\ninteractions or a greater degree of flexible purposive guidance of the\nsort associated with the self-conscious control of thought.\nAlternatively, one might try to define conscious states in terms of\nconscious creatures. That is, one might give some account of what it is\nto be a conscious creature or perhaps even a conscious self, and then\ndefine one's notion of a conscious state in terms of being a state of\nsuch a creature or system, which would be the converse of the last\noption considered above for defining conscious creatures in terms of\nconscious mental states.\n",
