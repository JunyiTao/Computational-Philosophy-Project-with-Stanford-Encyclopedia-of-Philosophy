    "main_text": "What was condemned?\n3. What was condemned?\n\nThe condemnation of 1277 not only covered the already mentioned\nsyllabus of 219 errors, but also the work \u201cDe\namore\u201d by Andreas Capellanus, a treatise on geomancy with\nthe incipit \u201cEstimaverunt Indi\u201d and the explicit\n\u201cRacionare ergo super eum, et invenies, etc.\u201d\n\u2013 which has not yet been identified \u2013 and unnamed\ntreatises on necromancy, witchcraft, or fortune-telling.\n\nOf interest to historians of philosophy is the list of censured\npropositions. It is unknown what method Tempier and his advisers used\nto draw up their syllabus of 219 errors. Usually, it is claimed that\nTempier\u2019s list not very well organised and \u201cbroad in scope\nto the point of confusion.\u201d However, the lack of doctrinal\ncohesion is also present in other lists of the Collectio\nerrorum, simply because the order in which the charged errors\nappeared on the roll was determined by other factors such as, for\ninstance, the order in which they appeared in the examined work.\nShortly after 1277 the extremely long list of 219 prohibited views was\nreorganized, possibly to facilitate its use in the academic community.\nAt the beginning of this century, Pierre Mandonnet once again put\nTempier\u2019s articles into a new order, numbering and\ndistinguishing the 179 philosophical theses from the 40 theological\nones.\n\nA very helpful summary of the condemned propositions has been provided\nby John F. Wippel. The first seven of the philosophical propositions\nbear on the nature and excellence of philosophy. Propositions 8\nthrough 12 (in the numbering of Mandonnet) have a bearing on the\nknowability and nature of God. Propositions 13\u201315 concern divine\nknowledge, and 16 through 26 divine omnipotence. Many of the articles,\nnotably 34\u201361 regard the separate intelligences (angels).\nAnother interesting group of articles is 67\u201369. By condemning\nthese articles, Tempier endorsed God\u2019s absolute power to do\nwhatever he wills. Other interesting themes that are touched in the\nphilosophical articles are the world\u2019s eternity (80 through 89),\nthe unicity of the human intellect and its implications (117 through\n133), and human freedom and free will (151 through 166). Among the\ntheological articles, themes that appear are theology as a science\n(180\u2013186), the doctrine of the Eucharist (196\u2013199),\nChristian morality (202\u2013205), and human immortality and reward\nand punishment in the life to come (213\u2013219). It should be\nemphasized that Tempier\u2019s theses express positions that cannot\nbe maintained in light of revealed truth; for this reason, each is\nfollowed by the qualification, \u201cerror\u201d.\n\nRecently, Sylvain Piron has argued that Tempier\u2019s list of\ncondemned articles does exhibit an encyclopedic organization, which\nsuggests that Tempier had a deliberate plan. Articles 25\u2013183 can\nbe divided into sub-sections which respectively touch upon the topics\nof God, angels, the world, the soul, the intellect, the will,\nphilosophy, the will again (due to the misplacement of a rubric), and\nethics. The same global order is also present in articles 1\u201324.\nThe final articles, 184\u2013219, seem to be a miscellaneous\ncollection. Possibly, Tempier\u2019s list actually consists of three\nseparate lists.\n",
