    "main_text": "Emotional Misidentification\n5. Emotional Misidentification\n\n\nRobert Yanal offers a resolution to the paradox by denying the third \npremise, that repeaters feel genuine suspense on repeated encounters \nwith familiar narratives. Yanal\u2019s emotional misidentification view \nholds that there are no true repeaters, only misidenitifiers. He \nargues that since suspense requires uncertainty, the best account for\nthe any claim that the same movie was just as suspenseful on the 4th,\n5th, or 6th viewing is that the recidivist is confused, mislabeling \nhis emotional response. The recidivist is not feeling suspense, \nonly anticipation. Uncertainty is necessary for suspense, but not for\nmere anticipation. \n\n\nHowever, feeling suspense upon repeated viewings after a great span \nof time is an altogether different phenomenon. We often forget how a \nstory unfolds and are genuinely uncertain about what happens. So, in \na sense, the fiction is new for forgetters. On Yanal\u2019s account, one \ncan be a confused recidivist, a forgetter, or a virgin viewer; but, \none cannot be a true repeater. True repeaters are not possible, since\nthey lack the cognitive uncertainty necessary for suspense. \n\n\nYanal\u2019s solution rests on the distinction between anticipation and \nsuspense. But lacking a clear phenomenal distinction between the kind\nof anticipation that viewers putatively confuse with suspense and \ngenuine suspense, we have cause to be suspicious. Since this kind of \nanticipation and suspense appear to feel the same, the principal \ndifference, on Yanal\u2019s account, must be that the reaction cannot be \nsuspense proper without the cognitive state of uncertainty. If so, \nYanal has simply defined the problem under the rug. Why, we must ask,\ndo viewers feel \u201canticipation\u201d in response to narrative situations \nwhere they know the characters will survive unharmed? \n\n\nWithout much exposition, Yanal seizes upon the notion that suspense \nrequires uncertainty. From there he constructs an a priori \nargument to the effect that it is impossible that suspense occur when\nthe outcomes are known. On this definition alone, he concludes that \neither repeaters have forgotten the outcome, and they are not true \nrepeaters, or they have misidentified the emotion they are \nexperiencing. \n\n\nOn the same line of reasoning, audience members must be \nmisidentifying a range of emotional responses, including fear. The \ngeneration of suspense in repeaters is no less mysterious than the \ngeneration of fear. We feel fear in response to familiar fictional \nevents that we know will turn out well. But how could this be \npossible? How can we fear an event that we know will result in a \ndesired outcome? The same question arises concerning both \nfirst-person fear (fear for one\u2019s self) and fear for others. \n\n\nYanal argues that \u201cexperiencing fear is neither itself suspenseful \nnor is it contingent upon ignorance. (I may know with certainty that \nmy friend will be executed tomorrow, and yet feel fear for him, \nanxiety over his welfare, etc)\u201d (Yanal 1999, 139). Without any hope \nthat your friend will be executed, you would most likely feel dread, \nnot fear. But this is beside the point, since the situation with most\nfictions is that you feel fear where you know with certainty, say if \nyou have seen the movie before, that nothing bad will happen to the \nhero. Again, consider Speed: If you have seen the film or know\nthe genre conventions, then you know that nothing bad will happen to \nthe main characters, though it is possible to feel fear upon repeated\nviewings. At least, it appears to be possible if we have any faith at\nall in the phenomenological reports of audiences. \n\n\nIf the relevant form of fear is best described as a prospect emotion,\nthen the cognitive state of uncertainty would plausibly be necessary \nfor fear. Are we to conclude that audience members must be confusing \nwhat they take to be fear with some other emotion? If so, what could \nit possibly be? Although we may not be infallible introspectors, we \ncannot help but assume that people can reliably identify when they \nfeel fear. An a priori assumption that fear requires \nuncertainty is not sufficient to warrant the attribution of pervasive\nemotional misidentification. The same goes for suspense. \n\n\nOne reason why it may sound more plausible to hypothesize radically \nfallible introspective abilities regarding suspense but not fear, is \nthat suspense seems to be a composite emotional state, lacking the \ncorresponding kind of clear specifications. Rather than a pure \nemotional kind, suspense is better described as an emotional amalgam,\ncomprised of fear and hope, where uncertainty, if it is required, is \nimplied in the components: As such, suspense is a best thought of as \na composite emotion. \n",
