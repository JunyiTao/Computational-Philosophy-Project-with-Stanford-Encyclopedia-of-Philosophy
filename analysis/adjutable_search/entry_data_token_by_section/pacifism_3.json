    "main_text": "Defining Peace || Peace of a Just and Tranquil Order\n1.3 Peace of a Just and Tranquil Order\n\nOpposed to peace as modus vivendi is what Aron calls,\n\u201cpeace by satisfaction\u201d (Aron 1966, 160 ff). This is a\npeace that results from a lack of grievances and hostility. In the\nhistory of the West, this sort of peace is often linked to what\nAugustine called the \u201ctranquility of order\u201d (Augustine\n1958, Book 19, Chapter 13) In recent Western thought, this idea often\nfollows Kant in claiming that liberal democracy is the key to such a\ntranquil order.\n\nFrancis Fukuyama\u2019s Hegelian idea about the \u201cend of\nhistory,\u201d for example, hoped that the end of the Cold War would\nbring about the end of war in general, as liberal-democracy spread\n(Fukuyama 1992). Similarly, Michael Doyle has claimed that democracies\ndo not go to war with one another (Doyle 1997; see Gursozlu 2017).\nJohn Rawls has explained the stability of well-ordered democratic\nstates as follows: \u201cThere is true peace among them because all\nsocieties are satisfied with the status quo for the right\nreasons\u201d (Rawls 1999, 47). More recently, this idea about the\nstabilizing and peace-making power of democracy has influenced\nneo-conservative ideas in U.S. foreign policy, where the hope is that\npeace will occur as democracy is spread.\n\nThe idea that peace is founded in a just political order is connected\nto the ideas of the just war tradition. Defenders of the just war\ntradition\u2014from Augustine to Walzer\u2014argue that occasionally\nit is necessary to make war in order to establish such a tranquil and\njust social condition. More recent defenders of the just war idea have\nargued that interventionist wars should be fought in order to create\nstable conditions by defending human rights (see\n footnote 1).\n\nPacifists will disagree with those who claim that wars should be\nfought in pursuit of the ideal of a just and stable social order.\nProponents of humanitarian intervention maintain that war is a\nsuitable means for attaining the goal of respect for human rights and\nsatisfaction of human needs; but pacifists will argue that only\nnonviolent means are coherent with the these intended ends.\n",
