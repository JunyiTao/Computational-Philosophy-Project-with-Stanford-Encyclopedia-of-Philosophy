    "main_text": "Critical Theories Today || .3 Political Crises\n4.3 Critical Practices\n\nWhile overcoming the gap between theory and practice has been a\ncentral methodological and political concern for critical theorists,\ncritics have pointed out the prominent turn away from practice to\ntheory in the first generation \u2013 accused by Luk\u00e1cs of\ntaking up residence in the \u201cGrand Hotel Abyss\u201d\n(Luk\u00e1cs 1963, 22) \u2013 and the continued marginalization of\ncritical praxis in later generations (Harcourt 2020). There are\nmultiple grounds for challenging this assessment. Frankfurt School\ntheorists had arguments all along about how to assess and relate to\nradical movements, such as the student movement of 1968 (Adorno and\nMarcuse 1969, Freyenhagen 2014, Pickford 2023), and there has always\nbeen a strand that continuously engaged with struggles and movements,\nfrom Marcuse to Negt and Kluge and Fraser. Some critical theorists\nhave focused on deliberative democracy, the public sphere, and civil\nsociety (Habermas 1962, 1992, 2021, Cohen and Arato 1992, Benhabib\n2004, Lafont 2019) as core fora for critical practice, while others\nhave argued for critical theory itself to be democratized and\nunderstood as a critical practice (Bohman 2003, Celikates 2009).\n\nStill, many of these approaches have been criticized for prioritizing\ninstitutional achievements over struggles and critical practices, and\nreform over revolution. Given the challenges outlined above (4.2), it\nis not surprising that some recent work tries to reverse this tendency\nby exploring more radical responses to such crises. These attempts\nnotably push beyond the dichotomy between reform and revolution\n\u2013 for example, by promoting non-reformist reforms that could\n\u201calter the terrain on which future struggles will be waged, thus\nexpanding the set of feasible options for future reforms\u201d\n(Fraser, in Fraser and Honneth 2003, 79) \u2013 and mine the rich\nhistory and present of radical struggles outside traditional forms of\npolitical organizing such as the party or reimagine the party in\nradical ways (Dean 2016).\n\nThe range of critical practices engaged with by critical theorists\npast and present is extensive (for an inventory, see Harcourt 2020,\nCh. 15). Frankfurt School theorists of earlier generations covered\nvarious forms of resistance, from the \u201cGreat Refusal\u201d of\nthe 1960s (Marcuse) and the potential for resistance in independent\nthinking and critical analysis in the face of universal reification\n(Adorno) to civil disobedience as a sign of a dynamic public sphere\nand civil society (Habermas 1983b, Cohen and Arato 1992, Ch. 11). More\nrecently, critical theorists within various traditions have analyzed\nforms of disobedience (direct, digital, migrant etc.) as political\npractices of contestation and struggles for democratization\n\u201cfrom below\u201d (Young 2001, Smith 2013, Scheuerman 2018,\nCelikates 2019b). Other practices of resistance that do not directly\nengage with state institutions or appeal to the broader public include\nforms of sabotage (Malm 2020), fleeing, withdrawal, or defection.\nThese turn away from what are seen as state-oriented struggles for\nvisibility, recognition, or representation (Virno 2004, Roberts 2015)\nand towards subaltern forms of sociality (Moten and Harney 2013) and\ncounter-communities that prefigure fundamental alternatives for living\ntogether (Loick 2021). Emphasizing the revolutionary dimension of\ncritical practices, theorists have drawn on the abolitionist tradition\nof struggles against slavery and colonialism, and its revitalization\nin movements like Black Lives Matter, to call for a fundamental\ncritique of racial capitalism and its entanglement with the punitive\nstate, and a correspondingly radical transformation of all social\nrelations and institutions (Davis 2005, Gilmore 2022). Critical\ntheorists have also explored political practices of assembling (Butler\n2015), occupying, striking, and reorganizing processes of social\nreproduction (Gago 2019), linking these to the need to rethink\nrevolution beyond the model of a single break or event and more as an\ninterstitial process (Redecker 2018, Saar 2020).\n\nWhether the new revolutionary subjects and struggles that emerge in\nthese critical practices will indeed converge to fundamentally\nchallenge the existing order, open up new pathways to emancipation,\nand develop emancipated \u2013 more just, democratic, and sustainable\n\u2013 modes of living together remains to be seen.\nHorkheimer\u2019s quip still holds: \u201cif the proof of the\npudding is in the eating, the eating here is still in the\nfuture\u201d (1937a [1972, 220\u20131]). Against this background,\ntheoretical explorations of critical practices \u2013 in the\nmultiplicity of their forms, terrains, and actors \u2013 can be seen\nas part of the ongoing attempt to bring theory and practice together\nwith an emancipatory orientation in light of the crises and struggles\nof the age. This approach has characterized the Frankfurt School from\nits very beginnings and has been a driving force in its continual\n(self-)transformation, making it into one of the most influential\nparadigms in social philosophy today.\n",
