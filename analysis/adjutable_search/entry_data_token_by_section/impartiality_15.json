    "main_text": "Partiality and Impartiality || The Partialist-Impartialist Debate\n6.2 The Partialist-Impartialist Debate\n\nAlthough many people continue to speak of a \u2018partialist vs.\nimpartialist debate,\u2019 it should by now be clear that neither\n\u2018partialism\u2019 nor \u2018impartialism\u2019 unambiguously\ndenote any single moral position; at best, they designate two poles of\na continuum, one of which attributes no moral significance to the\ndemands of (any sort of) impartiality, the other of which sees\nmorality as exhausted by (some version of) impartiality. While a\nsomewhat general distinction can be usefully maintained, it is\nmisleading to think of the partialist-impartialist debate as a dispute\nbetween two clearly defined, and clearly opposed, camps (Deigh 1991;\nBarry 1995, 191\u20135). Maximilian de Gaynesford goes so far as to\nargue that \u201cdebates about partialism and impartialism thrive on\ntacit assumptions about the way each relates to the first person.\nThese assumptions rest on mistakes and confusions \u2026\u201d (de\nGaynesford 2010).\n\nThus, any general claim beginning with the words \u2018partialists\n(or impartialists) think that\u2026\u2019 is bound to be both\nmisleading and contentious. In particular, there is good reason to be\nwary of objections to impartialism which claim that all impartialists\nendorse extreme moral demands, or that they require that practical\nreasoning be completely expunged of every vestige of the partial. It\nis true, of course, that at least some impartialists, such as Godwin,\nhave endorsed such claims. But many do not. Deontologists, as we have\nseen, hold impartiality to be a deep and significant element of\nmorality, but they also tend to allow for a considerable degree of\nfirst-order partiality. And even many consequentialists are prepared\nto admit the legitimacy of partial reasoning in some contexts, if only\non an instrumental basis. It is useful, then, to draw a distinction\nbetween two sorts of impartialist moral theory. Impartialist theories\nwhich require all agents to display first-order impartiality at all\ntimes (Godwin\u2019s, for example) might be referred to as strict\nimpartialist theories. Impartialist theories which allow for some\nfirst-order partiality, but which nevertheless insist that all such\nbehavior be justified in second-order impartialist terms, might be\nreferred to as fundamentally impartialist moral theories. The\nclass of fundamentally impartial theories will include not only\ncontractualist, Kantian, and rule consequentialist theories, but also\ncertain act consequentialist theories (e.g. Railton 1986) which allow\nthe practice of first-order partiality as a means of promoting the\nimpersonal good. Such theories allow for partiality that is\npermissible, justifiable, and perhaps even admirable in moral terms.\nAt the same time, however, they insist that all such partiality is\nultimately reducible \u2013 that is, justifiable in impartialist\nterms at some deeper level.\n\nWithin the partialist camp, a strict partialist might be\ndefined as holding that no sort of impartiality plays any moral role\nwhatsoever \u2013 a logically possible, but uncommon, position. A\nmoderate partialist, by contrast, would admit that\nimpartiality of some sort plays a moral role, but deny that this role\nencompasses, or grounds, all of morality; in particular, such a figure\nwould be committed to the existence, in some contexts at least, of\nirreducible morally admirable partiality. A virtue theorist, for\ninstance, might make a significant place for impartiality by selecting\nit as one of the virtues; but a virtue of this sort would presumably\nhave to compete with other deeply partialist virtues such as loyalty,\nwhich would override impartiality in at least some contexts.\n\nTo the extent that a deep issue between partialists and impartialists\ncan be identified, it is presumably the question of whether\n(irreducible) morally admirable partiality does indeed exist; and it\nis along this line of dispute that the debate seems likeliest to\ncontinue. (Whether this debate is identical to the so-called\n\u2018justice-care\u2019 debate, as contended in Cannold, et\nal (1995), is questionable, though it is undeniable that there\nare important parallels.) However, this way of classifying the\ndisputants, and of characterizing the issue itself, is meant to be\nsuggestive rather than definitive. The fact remains that there are\nmany types of partialist theories, and many types of impartialist\nones, and that continuing to speak of the\n\u2018partialist-impartialist debate\u2019 in loose and imprecise\nterms is more likely to obscure than to illuminate.\n",
