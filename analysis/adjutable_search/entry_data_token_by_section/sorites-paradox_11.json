Unlike epistemic responses to the sorites which\npostulate inscrutable boundaries, supervaluationism is frequently\nassociated with a semantic approach to vagueness seemingly committed\nto the inscrutability of reference.\n\nConsider a sorites paradox using the predicate \u2018is on\nEverest\u2019 using the series of millimetre discriminations along a\nline from its peak to the valley floor below. The first point (the\nsummit) is clearly on Everest. The last (in the valley) clearly is\nnot. And there is no clear point in between where we would draw the\nsharp boundary separating the mountain from its surrounds. The\nvagueness or indeterminacy that underwrites this sorites paradox is,\non this approach, not a result of epistemic limitations, nor a result\nof indeterminacy in Everest itself but, rather, arises as a result of\nindeterminacy surrounding what to count as the referent of the term.\nAccording to the supervaluationist, vagueness is a matter of semantic\nindecision, as it is frequently put. In the case to hand, there is\nsimply no fact of the matter as to exactly what portion of earth is\nreferred to. There is a range of admissible candidates, all with equal\nclaim to be Everest, amongst which we have simply not decided, nor (to\nparaphrase Lewis) is anyone stupid enough to try. In such a case,\noverlapping the problem of the many (see the entry on the problem of\nthe many), the theory commits to a singular term\n\u2018Everest\u2019, though apparently a denoting phrase, lacking\nany unique determinate referent. This accords with Russell\u2019s much\nearlier analysis of vagueness as \u201cone-manyness in\ndenotation\u201d.\n\nAs Keefe (2000: ch. 7.1) points out, supervaluationism thus understood\nnonetheless makes true the claim that there is but one (sharply\nbounded) Mt Everest (thus claiming a solution to the problem of the\nmany, and to the foregoing sorites paradox since it is true that there\nis a sharp cut-off point to being on Everest) even if there is no one\n(sharply bounded) mountain of which it is true that it is the thing\nreferred to by \u2018Everest\u2019 (and thus no point on the\nmountain of which we can say that it is truly the cut-off point).\nThere is but one Everest but there is no fact of the matter what it\nis.\n\nAs with earlier problems concerning the role of existential\nquantification in supervaluationism, one can debate whether this is a\nconsequence to be embraced or an untoward consequence undermining the\ntheory being advanced. It is certainly surprising that reference is\ninscrutable in this way. Moreover, such cases are not the exception;\ngiven the ubiquity of vague singular terms such cases appear to be the\nrule (see Lewis 1993; McGee & McLaughlin 2000; Morreau 2002).\n",
