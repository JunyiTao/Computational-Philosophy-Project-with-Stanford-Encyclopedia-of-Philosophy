Wheare 1964, King 1982, Elazar 1987, Elazar 1987a,\nRiker 1993, Watts 1998).\n\nA federal political order is here taken to be \u201cthe\ngenus of political organization that is marked by the combination of\nshared rule and self-rule\u201d (Watts 1998, 120).\nFederalism is the descriptive theory or normative advocacy of\nsuch an order, including principles for dividing final authority\nbetween member units and the common institutions.\n\nA federation is one species of such a federal order; other\nspecies are unions, confederations, leagues and decentralised\nunions\u2014and hybrids such as the present European Union (Elazar\n1987, Watts 1998). A federation in this sense involves a\nterritorial division of power between constituent\nunits\u2014sometimes called \u2018provinces\u2019,\n\u2018cantons\u2019, possibly \u2018cities\u2019, or confusingly\n\u2018states\u2019\u2014and a common government. This division of\npower is typically entrenched in a constitution which neither a member\nunit nor the common government can alter unilaterally. The member unit\nand the common government both have direct effect on the\ncitizenry\u2014the common government operates \u201con the\nindividual citizens composing the nation\u201d (Federalist Paper\n39)\u2014and the authorities of both are directly elected (Watts\n1998, 121). In comparison, decentralized authority in unitary states\ncan typically be revoked by the central legislature at will. Many\nmultilevel forms of governance may also be revised by units at one\nlevel without consent by bodies at other levels. Such entrenchments\nnotwithstanding, some centralization often occurs owing to the\nconstitutional interpretations by a federal level court in charge of\nsettling conflicts regarding the scopes of final legislative and/or\njudicial authority.\n\nIn contrast, \u2018confederation\u2019 has come to mean a political\norder with a weaker center than a federation, often dependent on the\nconstituent units (Watts 1998, 121). Typically, in a confederation a)\nmember units may legally exit, b) the center only exercises authority\ndelegated by member units, c) the center is subject to member unit\nveto on many issues, d) center decisions bind member units but not\ncitizens directly, e) the center lacks an independent fiscal or\nelectoral base, and/or f) the member units do not cede\nauthority permanently to the center. Confederations are often based on\nagreements for specific tasks, and the common government may be\ncompletely exercised by delegates of the member unit governments. Thus\nmany would count as confederations the North American states during\n1776\u20131787, Switzerland 1291\u20131847, and the present European\nUnion\u2014though it has several elements typical of federations.\n\nIn symmetric (con)federations the member\nunits have the same bundles of powers, while in asymmetric\n(con)federations such as Russia, Canada, the\nEuropean Union, Spain, or India the bundles may be different among\nmember units; some member units may for instance have special rights\nregarding language or culture. Some asymmetric arrangements involve\none smaller state and a larger, where the smaller partakes in\ngoverning the larger while retaining sovereignty on some issues\n(Elazar 1987, Watts 1998).\n\nA helpful categorisation among federal arrangements concerns the\nrelationship between the central unit, member units and individuals.\nIf the decisions made centrally do not involve member units at all, we\nmay speak of separate (split or compact)\nfederalism. Some issues may be the responsibility of the central unit,\nothers belonging to the member units, where citizens vote their\nrepresentatives directly to both bodies (U.S. Constitution Art. II\nSection 1; cf. Dahl 2001). Federations can involve member units in\ncentral decision-making in at least two different ways in various\nforms of interlocking (or cooperative) federalism.\nMember unit representatives can participate within central\nbodies\u2014in cabinets or legislatures\u2014(collective agency\ncompositional arrangement). Or they constitute one central body\nthat interacts with other central bodies, for instance where member\nunit government representatives form an Upper House with power to veto\nor postpone decisions by majority or qualified majority vote\n(divided agency/relational arrangements). These\nlegal arrangements give rise to varieties of multi-level governance:\ncontinuous negotiations among authorities at different territorial\nlevels (Marks 1993, Hooghe and Marks 2003, Scharpf 1983).\nResponsiveness to individuals may benefit from interlocking\nfederalism, but often at the cost of transparency and\naccountability.\n\nSeveral authors identify two quite distinct processes that lead to a\nfederal political order (Friedrich 1968, Buchanan 1995, Stepan 1999\nand others). Independent states may aggregate by ceding or pooling\nsovereign powers in certain domains for the sake of goods otherwise\nunattainable, such as security or economic prosperity. Such coming\ntogether federal political orders are typically arranged to\nconstrain the center and prevent majorities from overriding a member\nunit. Examples include the present USA, Canada, Switzerland, and\nAustralia. Holding together federal political orders develop\nfrom unitary states, as governments devolve authority to alleviate\nthreats of unrest or secession by territorially clustered minorities.\nSuch federal political orders often grant some member units particular\ndomains of sovereignty e.g. over language and cultural rights in an\nasymmetric federation, while maintaining broad scope of\naction for the central government and majorities. Examples include\nIndia, Belgium and Spain.\n\nIn addition to territorially organized federal political orders, other\ninteresting alternatives to unitary states occur when\nnon-territorial member units are constituted by groups\nsharing ethnic, religious or other characteristics. These systems are\nsometimes referred to as \u2018non-territorial\u2019 federations.\nKarl Renner and Otto Bauer explored such arrangements for\ngeographically dispersed cultural minorities, allowing them some\ncultural and \u201cpersonal\u201d autonomy without territorial self\nrule (Bauer 1903; Renner 1907; Bottomore and Goode 1978; cf. Tamir\n1993 and Nimni 2005). Consociations consist of somewhat\ninsulated groups in member units who in addition are represented in\ncentral institutions often governing by unanimity rather than by\nmajority (Lijphart 1977).\n",
