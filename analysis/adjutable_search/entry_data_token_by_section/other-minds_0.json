    "main_text": "The (Traditional) Epistemological Problem\n1. The (Traditional) Epistemological Problem\n\nThe traditional epistemological problem of other minds is often\nassociated with scepticism. The sceptic raises a doubt about the\npossibility of knowledge in connection with the mind of another, a\ndoubt which is thought to follow from a more general doubt raised by\nDescartes concerning our knowledge of the external world. This latter\ndoubt arises in stages, each of which is designed to draw us into a\nmore wide-reaching scepticism: at stage one it is observed that the\nsenses sometimes deceive; at stage two the possibility of an extended\ndream is considered; and at stage three the possibility is introduced\nthat there is an Evil Demon deceiving me to think that there is a\nworld beyond how things appear. It is with the third stage that\nDescartes thought we encounter the possibility of universal doubt\nabout an entire domain, in this case the external world. Descartes has\nfound a way to retreat into his own mind, where he claims to find both\nknowledge and truth: I can know how things appear to me; external\nthings are now in doubt. Cartesian doubt is radical and it\nhas been raised by philosophers not just in connection with our\nknowledge of the external world, but also of the past, induction, and\nother minds.\n\nIn connection with other minds, we might press Descartes\u2019 first\nsceptical consideration, thus: I am sometimes deceived about what\nanother is thinking or feeling. But, as with the external world, this\nis not sufficient for radical doubt concerning others. Radical doubt\nmay be thought to arise when one presses the third sceptical\nconsideration, the possibility that an Evil Demon (or mad scientist)\nhas contrived that all others apart from myself are\nautomata/zombies\u2014non-thinking, non-feeling individuals who move\nin a manner similar to the way I move. We can associate a\n\u2018thin\u2019 sceptical problem with the former doubt and a\n\u2018thick\u2019 sceptical problem with the latter (Avramides\n2015). The former is a problem we grapple with in our everyday lives;\nthe latter is a distinctively philosophical problem. It is the thick\nskeptical problem that leads to the possibility of\nsolipsism\u2014that I am alone in the universe.\n\nOnce one teases out a thin from a thick problem, one can ask the\nfollowing: (i) does any proposed response to the thick problem help\nwith the thin?; (ii) does having knowledge (in any domain) depend upon\na solution to the thick problem?; and (iii) are there any further\nquestions that can be raised with respect to other minds beyond those\nassociated with these two sceptical problems? It is fair to say that\nlittle to no consideration was paid to question (i) in the past. It is\nthe threat of solipsism that largely preoccupied philosophers\u2014at\nleast until more recently. Question (ii) has received much discussion\nin recent decades. Epistemologists who favor an externalist approach\n(e.g., Goldman, Nozick, Dretske) concentrate on the question of\nwhat others think and feel. In line with the general\nexternalist approach, these philosophers hold that there can be\nknowledge despite there being no response to the radical sceptical\nchallenge. Others agree that having knowledge does not require\nresponding to this challenge, but not because they believe that there\nis no response here but because they believe that the correct account\nof knowledge leaves no room for such a challenge (McDowell 1982). With\nrespect to (iii), Zahavi (2014) has identified a further question that\nhe labels the why question. In our everyday encounters with,\nand understanding of, others we want to know not only what they think\nand feel, but also why they think and feel as they do and what this\nmeans to them.\n\nNot everyone takes the epistemological problem here to be a radical\nskeptical one. Some see the problem as arising from reflection on an\napparent asymmetry in the way I know about my own and another\u2019s\nmind: in my own case, at least most of the time, I know what I think\nand feel directly and without inference from any evidence (the\nqualification here is designed to reflect the fact that one can, at\ntimes, learn about one\u2019s own mental states from others\u2014see\nAustin 1946 [1979: 110]); in the case of others, all access to what\nthey think or feel is thought to be indirect, mediated by the\nother\u2019s behavior. Hyslop, for example, writes, \u201cthe\nproblem of other minds is generated by an asymmetry in respect of\nknowledge\u201d (1995: 6; cf. Davidson 1991 [2001]). Gomes (2018) has\nlabeled the epistemological problem raised by attention to this\nasymmetry the problem of sources, which he distinguishes from\nthe problem of error. Gomes finds the problem of sources in\nthe work of Austin (1946 [1979]) who begins his discussion of other\nminds by asking, \u201cHow do we know that, for example, another\nindividual is angry?\u201d, a question which Austin distinguishes\nfrom, \u201cDo we (ever) know\u2026?\u201d (cf. Cassam 2007 and\nNozick 1981).\n\nIt is worth pausing to consider the seriousness of the problem of\nknowing others. While some draw a parallel between the problem of\ngaining knowledge of the past and of another mind, there is an\nimportant asymmetry to be noted here: in the case of the past it is at\nleast logically possible that there should be direct knowledge, while\nin the case of another mind such knowledge seems to be logically ruled\nout. As A.J. Ayer writes:\n\n\nIt can be argued that one\u2019s position to observe a past event is\ndue to the accident of one\u2019s position in time\u2026. But it is\nnot an accident that one is not someone else. (1953 [1954:\n216\u2013217])\n\n\n(Discussions linking knowledge of other minds and the past provide a\nrich vein of philosophical discussion; see, for example, Dummett 1969,\nWright 1980, and McDowell 1998.) It may be thought that there could be\na way of knowing another\u2019s mind\u2014say by telepathy\u2014and\nthat it is simply a contingent fact that this is not a way that is\nopen to human beings. Telepathy would allow one to know\nanother\u2019s thoughts and feelings by coming to share them. The\nproblem, however, is that if I have your\nexperiences, then those experiences are mine and not\nyours. As Ayer writes: \u201cIn this respect telepathy is no\nbetter than the telephone\u201d (1953 [1954: 196]; cf. Austin 1946\nand Wisdom 1940).\n\nPhilosophers, thus, find themselves saddled with the question, How do\nI know that others have minds? One can put the emphasis on the word\n\u201cknow\u201d and raise a sceptical question parallel to\nthe one Descartes raises in connection with our knowledge of the\nexternal world, or one can put the emphasis on the word\n\u201chow\u201d and question the source of our knowledge given that\nI am not in a position to have direct knowledge of the mind of\nanother.\n",
