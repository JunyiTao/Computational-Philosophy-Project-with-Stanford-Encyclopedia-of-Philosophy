    "main_text": "Dance as Agency and Intentional Action || Dance Improvisation\n2.2 Dance Improvisation\n\n\u201cImprovisation\u201d in dance often refers to the intentional\nagency and action of dance-makers and performers (who may or may not\nbe the same people) rather than the result of that activity. Three\ntypes of improvisation in theater dance have been identified by Carter\n(2000: 182): 1) embellishments where set choreography persists, 2)\nimprovisation as spontaneous free movement for use in set choreography\nand 3) improvisation for its own sake brought to a high level of\nperformance. An example of 1) would be the situation in which a dance\nperformer is allowed to amplify existing movements (doing a triple\npirouette in place of a double, for example), or a stylistic flourish\nsuch as an extra flick of the wrist or tilt of the head. An example of\n2) would be the case in which no choreography has been provided for\neight bars of music and the dancer(s) is given the freedom to insert\nwhatever he or she wishes in the open space. Finally, 3) would cover\nthe situation that D. Davies (2011b) might call a \u201cwork\nperformance\u201d, where a work is choreographed by the dancers while\ndancing. It would also include the situation where either the whole\nperformance or a substantial part of it is improvised from start to\nfinish. Dances comprised of Steve Paxton\u2019s \u201ccontact\nimprovisation\u201d, for example, would count as improvisation for\nits own sake (see Paxton 1975 and 1981).\n\nDanielle Goldman (2010) provides a critical analysis of the idea of\nimprovisational \u201cfreedom\u201d, as represented in\nCarter\u2019s improvisation type 2, above. She suggests that we\nexamine social and historical constraints on the possibility of\n\u201cfreedom\u201d, since such freedom cannot exist in oppressive\nconditions such as slavery where prohibitive social as well as\nphysical barriers exist. Goldman thus suggests an alternative form of\nimprovisation, one that is \n\n\na rigorous mode of making oneself ready for a range of potential\nsituations\u2026an incessant preparation, grounded in the present\nwhile open to the next moment\u2019s possible actions and\nconstraints. (2010: 142)\n\n\nIn \u201cTaken by Surprise: Improvisation in Dance and Mind\u201d,\nSusan Leigh Foster (2003) shares Goldman\u2019s view that it is the\nmoment right before an actual dance movement within a performance that\nmatters to the special aesthetic experience of dance improvisation.\nShe says, \u201cit is this suspense-filled plenitude of the\nnot-quite-known that gives live performance its special\nbrilliance\u201d (2003: 4). Her essay also contains a\nphenomenological account of the agency involved in improvisation,\nequating the lived experience of improvisation with a \u201cmiddle\nvoice\u201d, in which a dancer finds herself in a flow of movement\nthat takes the middle position between deliberative choices and\npassive direction.\n\nDance philosophers have also identified other forms of dance\nimprovisation that do not fit within Carter\u2019s three categories.\nKent de Spain (2003), for example, brings our attention to a type of\ndance improvisation that is practiced by dancers in order to achieve a\nmovement-based somatic state, what we shall call \u201csomatic\nimprovisation\u201d. Somatic improvisation, or the results of these\nimprovisational exercises, may be included in a theater performance\nfor an audience but need not be. Constance Valis Hill (2003) includes\n\u201cchallenge dance\u201d performances, stemming from the\nAfrican-American tradition of dance \u201cbattles\u201d, where the\npurpose is to win an ever-escalating competition of skill and style.\nLike somatic improvisation, challenge dance improvisation can be\noffered for audience appreciation in a concert context but need not\nbe\u2014it has taken place in social and street settings, for\nentertainment as well as for \u201cartistic\u201d purposes. Aili Bresnahan\n(2014a) has made the claim that all live dance performance\ninvolves improvisational artistry to at least some extent and that\nthis can be seen as a kind of embodied and extended agency under\nembodied and extended mind theories, in particular that of Andy Clark\nin his book, Supersizing the Mind: Embodiment, Action, and\nCognitive Extension (2011).\n\nFor more on improvisation in dance, see Albright and Gere 2003;\nClemente 1990; De Spain 1993, 2014, and 2019; Kloppenberg 2010;\nMatheson 2005; Novack 1990 and 1988 [2010]; Pallant 2006; Paxton 1975\nand 1981; Zaporah 2003; and The Oxford Handbook of Improvisation\nin Dance (Midgelow 2019).
