Virtue and Happiness: The Correspondence with Princess Elisabeth\n\nDescartes\u2019 correspondence with Princess Elisabeth has as its\ncentral topic the relation of mind and body\u2014a relation that is\nexplored from the point of view of both theory (the problem of\nmind-body union) and practice (see Shapiro 2007 for a full account of\nthe correspondence). With regard to practice, Descartes is again\nconcerned with the connection between physical and mental well-being,\nand in particular the deleterious effects of passions such as sadness,\ngrief, fear and melancholy. He discusses these topics in the course of\nadvising Elisabeth on how to cope with her own illness and distress.\nThe question, however, is an ancient one: when faced with the\nhardships of life\u2014physical illness, loss, anxiety\u2014how can\none respond in a way that allows one to preserve the tranquility that\nis the core of our happiness?\n\nDescartes\u2019 abiding interest in medicine is prominent here, since\nthe treatment of physical illness is an effective way of removing one\nof main sources of mental disturbance. Yet he is well aware of the\nlimits of medical knowledge, and so he acknowledges that the passions\nalso must be confronted directly: \u201cThey are domestic enemies\nwith whom we are forced to keep company, and we have to be perpetually\non guard lest they injure us\u201d (AT IV 218/CSMK 249). Descartes\nprescribes to Elisabeth a two-part remedy for protecting herself\nagainst the harmful effects of the passions: \u201cso far as possible\nto distract our imagination and senses from them, and when obliged by\nprudence to consider them, to do so with our intellect alone\u201d\n(ibid.). The first part of the remedy relies on our ability to direct\nthe imagination away from the immediate objects of the passions. Given\nthis power, Descartes argues, \u201cthere might be a person who had\ncountless genuine reasons for distress but who took such pains to\ndirect his imagination that he never thought of them except when\ncompelled by some practical nececessity, and who spent the rest of his\ntime in the consideration of objects which could furnish contentment\nand joy\u201d (AT IV 219/CSMK 250). Descartes speculates that this\nkind of cognitive therapy by itself might be sufficient to restore the\npatient to health. In circumventing the causal pathway by which the\npassion arises, the body will be returned to a healthy state.\nDescartes offers his own history as an example of this phenomenon:\n\u201cFrom [my mother] I inherited a dry cough and a pale colour\nwhich stayed with me until I was more than twenty, so that all the\ndoctors who saw me up to that time gave it as their verdict that I\nwould die young. But I have always had an inclination to look at\nthings from the most favorable angle and to make my principal\nhappiness depend upon myself alone, and I believe that this\ninclination caused the indisposition, which was almost part of my\nnature, gradually to disappear completely\u201d (AT IV 221/CSMK 251).\nThis line of thought leads directly to the Passions of the\nSoul, in which Descartes discusses at length the causation and\nfunction of the passions.\n\nThe second part of the remedy prescribed to Elisabeth aligns\nDescartes\u2019 position with that of the ancients, who stress the\nrole of reason in regulating the passions. The person who is led by\npassion will inevitably experience sadness, grief, fear,\nanxiety\u2014emotions inconsistent with \u201cperfect\nhappiness.\u201d Such happiness is the possession alone of those\nelevated souls in which reason \u201calways remains\nmistress\u201d:\n\nthe difference between the greatest souls and those that are base and\ncommon consists principally in the fact that common souls abandon\nthemselves to their passions and are happy or unhappy only according\nas the things that happen to them are agreeable or unpleasant; the\ngreatest souls, on the other hand, reason in a way that is so strong\nand cogent that, although they also have passions, and indeed passions\nwhich are often more violent than those of ordinary people, their\nreason nevertheless always remains mistress, and even makes their\nafflictions serve them and contribute to the perfect happiness they\nenjoy in this life. (AT IV 202; translation from Gaukroger 2002, 236).\n\n\nThe link between reason and happiness is explored at length by\nDescartes in letters exchanged with Elisabeth during the summer and\nfall of 1645. The discussion begins with Descartes\u2019 suggestion\nthat they examine what the ancients had to say on the topic, and he\nchooses as exemplary Seneca\u2019s work \u201cOn the Happy\nLife\u201d (De Vita Beata). Descartes, however, quickly\nbecomes dissatisfied with Seneca\u2019s treatment and proposes\ninstead to explain to Elizabeth how he thinks the subject\n\u201cshould have been treated by such a philosopher, unenlightened\nby faith, with only natural reason to guide him\u201d (AT IV 263/CSMK\n257).\n\nBasic to Descartes\u2019 account is the distinction he draws between\n(i) the supreme good, (ii) happiness, and (iii) the final end or goal,\nnotions generally taken as equivalent in ancient eudaimonism (AT IV\n275/CSMK 261). Descartes identifies the supreme good with virtue,\nwhich he defines as \u201ca firm and constant will to bring about\neverything we judge to be the best and to employ all the force of our\nintellect in judging well\u201d (AT IV 277/CSMK 262). Virtue is the\nsupreme good, he argues, because it is \u201cthe only good, among all\nthose we can possess, which depends entirely on our free will\u201d\n(AT IV 276/CSMK 261), and because it is sufficient for happiness.\nDescartes explains happiness (la b\u00e9atitude) in\npsychological terms. It is the \u201cperfect contentment of mind and\ninner satisfaction\u2026 which is acquired by the wise without\nfortune\u2019s favor\u201d (AT IV 264/CSMK 257). According to\nDescartes, \u201cwe cannot ever practice any virtue\u2014that is to\nsay, do what our reason tells us we should do\u2014without receiving\nsatisfaction and pleasure from doing so\u201d (AT IV 284/CSMK 263).\nThus, happiness is a natural product of virtue and can be enjoyed\nregardless of what fortune brings. The dependence of happiness on\nvirtue is confirmed by Descartes\u2019 account of the final end,\nwhich, he says, can be regarded either as happiness or as the supreme\ngood: virtue is the target at which we ought to aim, but happiness is\nthe prize that induces us to fire at it (AT IV 277/CMSK 262).\n\nAnalysis of the fine structure of Descartes\u2019 ethical theory and\nits relation to ancient eudaimonist theories has emerged as an active\narea of research in recent years. Among the issues debated are the\ncontent of Descartes\u2019 notion of virtue, the identity of virtue\nand a human being\u2019s highest good, and the sufficiency of virtue\nfor happiness. While defending different answers to these questions,\nscholars have broadly agreed in seeing Descartes as advancing an\noriginal ethical theory that critically engages the positions of\nAristotle, Epicurus, and the Stoics. (For competing readings, some of\nwhich diverge from the account presented here, see Alanen 2009;\nGueroult 1985; Naaman-Zauderer 2010; Rutherford 2004, 2014; Santilli\n1992; Shapiro 2008, 2011; Svensson 2010, 2011, 2015, 2019a, 2019b,\n2020; Viljanen 2021; Wienand 2012; Youpa 2013.)\n\nAs Descartes defines it, virtue depends upon the employment of reason.\nThough it is conceivable that one might have a \u201cfirm and\nconstant will\u201d to do something without having examined whether\nit is the right thing to do, one cannot have a firm and constant will\nto do what is judged to be the best, unless one is capable of judging\nwhat the best is. Thus, virtue presupposes knowledge of the relative\ngoodness of objects of choice, and this knowledge Descartes assigns to\nreason: \u201cThe true function of reason\u2026 is to examine and\nconsider without passion the value of all the perfections, both of the\nbody and of the soul, which can be acquired by our conduct, so\nthat\u2026 we shall always choose the better\u201d (AT IV\n286\u20137/CSMK 265).\n\nBut how exactly does reason allow us to discriminate between lesser\nand greater goods? On one point Descartes\u2019 position is clear:\nthe claim of virtue to be the supreme good follows from the fact that\nit is nothing more than the correct use of our free will, employing it\nto choose whatever reason represents as the greatest good. As\nDescartes argues in the Fourth Meditation, we are in no way more like\nGod\u2014that is, more perfect\u2014than in our possession of free\nwill. Hence the correct use of this will is our greatest good:\n\u201cfree will is in itself the noblest thing we can have, since it\nmakes us in a way equal to God and seems to exempt us from being his\nsubjects; and so its correct use is the greatest of all the goods we\npossess\u201d (AT V 85/CSMK 326). Reason shows that the greatest good\nwithin our power is the perfection of the will. In any choice we make,\nthe value of the particular goods we pursue will always be less than\nthat of the will itself; hence, provided we act virtuously, we can be\ncontent, whether or not we succeed in obtaining whatever other goods\nwe seek.\n\nYet this still leaves open the question of how to assess the value of\nthese other goods. The supreme good, virtue, consists in a firm\nresolution to bring about whatever reason judges to be the best. But\non the basis of what does reason make this determination? What\nknowledge allows reason to form a well-founded judgment about the\ngoodness and badness of objects, in the pursuit of which we act\nvirtuously? Descartes criticizes Seneca on just this point\u2014that\nhe fails to teach us \u201call the principal truths whose knowledge\nis necessary to facilitate the practice of virtue and to regulate our\ndesires and passions, and thus to enjoy natural happiness\u201d (AT\nIV 267/CSMK 258). In response, Elisabeth worries that Descartes\u2019\naccount, which promises the attainment of happiness, might presuppose\nmore knowledge than we can possibly possess. In assuaging her concern,\nDescartes summarizes the knowledge he believes we can rely on in\ndirecting the will toward virtuous ends. It consists of a surprisingly\nsmall set of \u201cthe truths most useful to us.\u201d The first two\nare basic principles of Cartesian metaphysics as presented in the\nMeditations:\n\nThe existence of an omnipotent, supremely perfect God, whose\ndecrees are infallible. \u201cThis teaches us to accept calmly all\nthe things which happen to us as expressly sent by God\u201d (AT IV\n291\u20132/CSMK 265).\nThe immortality of the soul and its independence from the body.\n\u201cThis prevents us from fearing death, and so detaches our\naffections from the things of this world that we look upon whatever is\nin the power of fortune with nothing but scorn\u201d (AT IV 292/CSMK\n266).\n\n\nThe next three truths derive from Cartesian natural philosophy,\nbroadly understood:\n\nThe indefinite extent of the universe. In recognizing this we\novercome our inclination to place ourselves at the center of the\ncosmos, as though everything ought to happen for our sake, which is\nthe source of \u201ccountless vain anxieties and troubles\u201d (AT\nIV 292/CSMK 266).\nThat we are part of a larger community of beings, whose interest\ntake precedence over our own. \u201cThough each of us is a person\ndistinct from others, whose interests are accordingly in some way\ndifferent from those of the rest of the world, we ought still to think\nthat none of us could subsist alone and that each one of us is really\none of the many parts of the universe\u2026. And the interests of\nthe whole, of which each of us is a part, must always be preferred to\nthose of our particular person\u201d (AT IV 293/CSMK 266).\nThat our passions represent goods as being much greater than they\nreally are, and that the pleasures of the body are never as lasting as\nthose of the soul or so great in possession as they are in\nanticipation. \u201cWe must pay careful attention to this, so that\nwhen we feel ourselves moved by some passion we suspend our judgment\nuntil it is calmed, and do not let ourselves be deceived by the false\nappearances of the goods of this world\u201d (AT IV 295/CSMK\n267).\n\n\nThe final proposition is of a quite different character:\n\nWhenever we lack certain knowledge of how to act, we should defer\nto the laws and customs of the land. \u201c[O]ne must also minutely\nexamine all the customs of one\u2019s place of abode to see how far\nthey should be followed. Though we cannot have certain demonstrations\nof everything, still we must take sides, and in matters of custom\nembrace the opinions that seem the most probable, so they we may never\nbe irresolute when we need to act. For nothing causes regret and\nremorse except irresolution\u201d (ibid.).\n\n\nThe truths that Descartes takes to be \u201cmost useful to us\u201d\ndo not consist of discoveries original to his philosophy. Rather, they\nreflect a general outlook on the world that could be embraced by\nsomeone without Cartesian sympathies: the existence of an omnipotent\nand supremely perfect God; the immortality of the soul; the vastness\nof the universe; that we have duties to a larger whole of which we are\na part; that our passions often distort the goodness of their objects.\nWhat Descartes can claim at most (and what he does claim in the\npreface to the Principles of Philosophy) is that he has\nsupplied better reasons for believing these propositions to be true;\nhe has established certain knowledge where before there was only\nunstable belief.\n\nThe establishment of a body of knowledge relevant to the practice of\nvirtue supplies the basis for a new set of moral rules that replaces\nthe provisional morality of the Discourse. Descartes presents\nthem to Elisabeth as a succinct recipe for happiness:\n\nIt seems to me that each person can make himself content by himself\nwithout any external assistance, provided he respects three\nconditions, which are related to the three rules of provisional\nmorality which I put forward in the Discourse on the Method.\nThe first is that he should always try to employ his mind as well as\nhe can to discover what he should and should not do in all the\ncircumstances of life. The second is that he should have a firm and\nconstant resolution to carry out whatever reason recommends without\nbeing diverted by his passions or appetites\u2026. The third is that\nhe should bear in mind that while he thus guides himself as far as he\ncan by reason, all the good things which he does not possess are one\nand all entirely outside his power. (AT IV 265/CSMK 257\u20138)\n\n\nHere the Discourse\u2019s final provisional rule has become\nthe first rule, reflecting the assumption that reason, in the form of\njudgments about good and evil, can serve as a reliable guide for\naction. Similarly, the Discourse\u2019s second rule, which\nprescribed that one be \u201cas firm and decisive in [one\u2019s]\nactions\u201d as one can, and \u201cfollow even the most doubtful\nopinions\u201d once adopted, has now become an injunction to carry\nout whatever reason recommends without being diverted by the passions.\nThe two sets of rules overlap most closely in the third rule, which\ncounsels us to recognize the limits of our power and to curtail our\ndesires for things outside of it. In this case too, however, the rule\nnow has a different status for Descartes, since it is supported by\ncertain knowledge of God, on whom all things depend, and the\nimmortality of the soul.\n\nThe truths that Descartes presents to Elisabeth supply a body of\nrational knowledge on the basis of which we are able to use our free\nwill correctly, choosing good over evil. Clearly, though, the guidance\noffered by these truths is of the most general sort. They do not\nunderwrite specific directives for action or dictate what we ought to\ndo in any particular circumstance. Instead, they are best seen simply\nas facilitating right action, by removing impediments to it (anxiety\nabout the future, fear of death) or saving us from obvious errors\n(ignoring the concerns of others, giving priority to bodily goods).\nThat the content of morality is underdetermined by the knowledge on\nwhich it depends is made clear by Descartes\u2019 final proposition,\nwhich instructs us to defer to the laws and customs of the land when\nit is not obvious how we ought to act. This proposition echoes the\nfirst rule of provisional morality that Descartes prescribes for\nhimself in the Discourse. However, this rule, too, has\nundergone an important transformation. Whereas in the\nDiscourse deference to the laws and customs of one\u2019s\ncountry is presented as the first rule of provisional morality, to\nElisabeth it is offered as a fallback position, acknowledging that\nwhile we do indeed possess certain knowledge of good and evil, there\nare limits to this knowledge.\n\nThe recognition of these limits is an enduring feature of\nDescartes\u2019 ethics. The truths outlined to Elizabeth lay down a\nset of general guidelines for how to use the will correctly. Following\nthem, however, does not guarantee that we infallibly choose the\ngreatest good; nor is success of this sort required for virtue. As far\nas virtue is concerned, the critical point is that we do whatever we\ncan to ascertain the best course of action, appealing if necessary to\ncivil law or custom, and that we then will decisively. (For more on\nthis point, see Rutherford 2014.)\n\nThis creates an important disanalogy for Descartes between the\ntheoretical and the practical. In both cases, we have a responsibility\nto correct our understanding before committing the will in judgment.\nOnly in the theoretical realm, however, is it reasonable to suspend\nassent indefinitely if we lack the knowledge needed to be confident of\nthe correctness of our decision. In the case of action, Descartes\ndenies that this is appropriate: \u201cAs far as the conduct of life\nis concerned, I am very far from thinking that we should assent only\nto what is clearly perceived. On the contrary, I do not think that we\nshould always wait even for probable truths\u201d (AT VII 149/CSM II\n106). In acting, the essential thing is that we will in the right\nmanner, allowing reason to guide our choice so far as it can.\n\u201cIt is\u2026 not necessary that our reason should be free from\nerror,\u201d he tells Elisabeth; \u201cit is sufficient if our\nconscience testifies that we have never lacked resolution and virtue\nto carry out whatever we have judged the best course\u201d (AT IV\n266/CSMK 258). Resolution, or firmness of judgment, is crucial, for it\nis the lack of this, above all, that causes \u201cregret and\nremorse\u201d and thereby threatens our happiness (AT IV 264/CSMK\n257).\n",
