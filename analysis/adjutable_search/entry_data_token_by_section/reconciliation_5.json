    "main_text": "Processes of Reconciliation || Truth Telling\n3.3 Truth Telling\n\nBoth apologies and memorials combine an acknowledgment of a\ntroublesome past with the suggestion of an emotional reaction to that\npast, such as remorse, regret or grief. Yet, even without such\nemotional content, the communication of the facts of the past can play\na role in reconciliation. Individual victims and survivors often find\nthemselves unable to move on when they are uncertain about crucial\nfacts of the past. What precisely happened to their loved one? Did she\nsuffer? Who exactly committed the violent act? Who gave the order?\nWhere is the body buried? Moreover, in political contexts wrongdoing\nis frequently officially denied, either in the refusal to acknowledge\nthat violations of rights occurred or that a particular agent such as\nthe state was responsible for the violations that are known.\n\nTruth telling, some scholars claim, can ameliorate ongoing suffering\nof victims and survivors who lack information about what happened and\nwho was (or was not) responsible for abuses (Zalaquett 1995). It can\ncounter certain forms of denial (Zalaquett 1995, Dyzenhaus 2000) and\nhelp combat the social structures that cultivate ignorance among more\nprivileged populations (Regan 2010, Steyn 2012). Truth telling may\nalso serve as a way of making reparation for those not actually\nimplicated in crimes. Efforts to record and archive this information,\nas well as to distribute it in the form of educational materials, aim\nat ensuring that future generations will not repeat the past.\n\nIn restorative justice processes, criminals are often required to give\na narrative of the crime (Llewellyn and Howse 1999). In the political\nsphere, one formal mechanism for uncovering and documenting the past\nis a truth commission. Truth commissions are temporary official\ninstitutions established to examine patterns of specified human rights\nabuses over a given time period (Hayner 2010). Dozens of truth\ncommissions have been established in communities around the globe,\nincluding Chile, Chad, and Canada. Commission reports provide a\nsummary of such findings and typically issue recommendations on how to\nprevent such abuses in the future. These reports vary in the degree to\nwhich the proceedings and findings are made public. Some name\nindividual perpetrators and some do not. The South African Truth and\nReconciliation Commission, which was marked by a high degree of\nopenness, televised the testimony of many victims and\nperpetrators.\n\nIn the literature, a variety of claims are advanced regarding how\ntruth commissions can contribute to reconciliation, both among\nindividual perpetrators and victims as well as within national\ncommunities. At the individual level, talking through the past is\noften represented as a form of catharsis, wherein the trauma of the\npast can be re-experienced, dealt with, and let go. The South African\nTRC appeared to offer several examples of such a process, including\nspontaneous requests for forgiveness by perpetrators and offers of\nforgiveness by victims (Tutu 1999, South African Truth and\nReconciliation Commission Final Report 1998).\n\nIn terms of societal reconciliation, it is claimed that truth\ncommissions reintegrate victims in a number of ways. The very fact\nthat victims state publicly what happened to them contributes to\nre-establishing their civic and political dignity as well as\nparticipatory standing (Kiss 2000). Officially recording the wrongs\ndone to victims, which were typically officially denied in the past,\nreinforces the equal moral standing of victims (du Toit 2000). The\nreport produced by a commission, especially when made public, can\ncultivate collective reconciliation by aiding a community to alter its\nself-understanding. A narrative must be produced of how a community\ncould at once have a past full of abuses as well as a present and\nideal future in which those abuses are rejected (Dwyer 1999). It can\nalso challenge stereotypes that dehumanized members of the community\nin the past (C. Murphy 2010) and foster sympathy (Eisikovits 2009).\nThe proceedings and report of a truth commission can foster trust in\ninstitutions (Gibson 2004). By condemning actions of the past, truth\ncommissions reassert the force of normative standards that have been\nviolated, or establish new normative standards for conduct when the\nextant terms for a relationship are unjust or immoral (Walker 2010).\nTelling the truth is taken to be a form of reparation for victims\n(Zalaquett 1995, Walker 2010). Finally, the recommendations issued by\ncommissions can contribute to the prevention of future wrongdoing.\n\nTruth commissions remain controversial. Many of the criticisms target,\nnot the value of establishing the truth itself, but the means used to\nencourage perpetrators to testify, such as amnesty from prosecution.\nOthers object to the ways in which truth commissions (sometimes\nsubtly) pressure victims toward a forgiveness or reconciliation they\nmay want to resist (Dyzenhaus 2000, Gutmann and Thompson 2000, C.\nMurphy 2010), or question the psychological benefits of giving\ntestimony for victims (Hamber 2009). Still other critics of truth\ncommissions charge that the pursuit of narrative self-understanding is\nobjectionable, insofar as it tries to establish a single authoritative\ninterpretation of the past (Gutmann and Thompson 2000, Regan 2010).\nFinally, there are doubts about the reconciliatory effects of\ncommissions that uncover the truth, but fail to take action against\nthose implicated in wrongs (Hamber 2009).\n",
