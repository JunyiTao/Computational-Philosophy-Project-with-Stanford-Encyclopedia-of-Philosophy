    "main_text": "Models of Brahman, God, and the Dao\n2. Models of Brahman, God, and the Dao\n\nThis section turns to multiple models of three ultimates extant in\nliving world traditions: Brahman in the Hindu traditions indigenous in\nIndia, God in the Abrahamic traditions (Judaism, Christianity and\nIslam) indigenous in the Middle East and the Arabian Peninsula, and\nthe Dao in the Daoist and Ru (Confucian) traditions indigenous in\nChina. The sections here are ordered historically, with the idea of\nBrahman surfacing first in the Rig Veda ca. 1000\u20131500 BCE, the\nidea of the Dao during the Warring States period ca. fifth century\nBCE, and the idea of God in the Jewish tradition shifting from a\nhenotheistic to monotheistic deity somewhere in between.\n\nA main point of looking at these models is to grasp some ways people\nacross the globe have conceived and are conceiving of what is most\nreal, most valuable or most fulfilling to them\u2014knowledge worth\nhaving for its own sake. Looking at the models also deepens\nunderstanding of ultimacy in general, by seeing how it plays out in\nthe specifics. Finally, studying the models is a window into how they\nrelate. Specifically, as we go, look for (1) the wide\nintra-traditional disagreement about how to model what is ultimate\n(e.g., there are Hindu monisms, panentheisms and dualisms) and related\n(2) the significant inter-traditional agreement about it (e.g., there\nare Hindu, Christian, and Daoist panentheisms). The amount of\ndisagreement within a tradition makes talk about \u201cthe\nidea of Brahman\u201d or \u201cthe idea of God\u201d ambiguous, and\ncrucially so in some contexts, as indicated in\n Section 1.2.\n The amount of agreement between traditions creates strange\nbedfellows across the landscape of models\u2014strange because the\nmodelers disagree about their religious or philosophical tradition,\nbut bedfellows all the same because they agree about which\nphilosophical categories from\n Section 1.5\n best suit what is ultimate (see Diller 2013a). The existence of such\nagreement at the very heart of diverse traditions is an important\nfact.\n\nOne perplexing issue before we encounter the models is the range of\ntheir connection to a lived religious tradition. The \u201creligious\nmodels\u201d purport to provide an understanding of reality as it is\nbelieved (or held by faith) to be in a particular tradition\u2014as\nevidenced by their efforts to capture as much as they can of a\ntradition\u2019s key texts, figures, practices, symbols\netc.\u2014while \u201cphilosophical models\u201d do not do this.\nFor example, the models of the Dao in\n Section 2.3\n seem to be religious models given the regular citations of the\nDaodejing and the Zhuangzi and liturgical practices\nin explication and defense of the models. Some philosophical models\ninclude Aristotle\u2019s Unmoved Mover or divine Nous\n(Physics Bk. VIII, Metaphysics Bk. XII),\nPlato\u2019s Demiurge in the Timaeus (29\u201330) or\nPlotinus\u2019 One in the Enneads. None of these modelers\nturn to traditional sources to explain or defend their views; indeed,\nit is not even clear what traditional sources would be germane.\nPerhaps there are intermediate \u201cquasi-religio-philosophical\nmodels\u201d, e.g., Spinoza 1677 or Hegel 1832, which have some\nsalient connection with a religious tradition, either because of the\nmodel\u2019s status as a revision of a traditional model or because\nthey share some key features of ultimacy within a religious\ntradition.\n\nThe puzzle: are all these modelers modeling the same thing? This\nquestion may be just a rehash of the \u201cGod of Abraham Isaac and\nJacob\u201d vs. \u201cGod of the philosophers\u201d issue (see\n Section 2.2).\n The answer to it is yes in the vague-categorial sense that both\nphilosophical and religious models are talking about that which is\nfundamentally real, valuable or liberating, but no in the sense that\nphilosophical models are about what is ultimate per se while\nthe religious models are about what is ultimate as it appears in their\ntradition. In any case, nota bene:\n Section 2.3\n (Models of God) houses several recent philosophical models because\nthey use the term \u201cGod\u201d to name the ultimate they are\nmodeling. Perhaps they are misnamed and should be renamed models of\n\u201cthe ultimate\u201d and housed in an entirely different\nsection. Or perhaps they are rightly named \u201cGod\u201d and God\nis not dead as Nietzsche had it, but is becoming increasingly unhinged\nfrom the lived religious traditions.\n",
