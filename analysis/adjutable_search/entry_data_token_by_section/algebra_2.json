We can solve this word problem using algebra by\nformalizing it as the equation \\(3x = x + 4\\) where \\(x\\) is\nXavier\u2019s present age. The left hand side expresses three times\nXavier\u2019s present age, while the right hand side expresses his\nage in four years\u2019 time.\n\nA general rule for solving such equations is that any solution to it\nis also a solution to the equation obtained by applying some operation\nto both sides. In this case we can simplify the equation by\nsubtracting \\(x\\) from both sides to give \\(2x = 4\\), and then\ndividing both sides by 2 to give \\(x = 2\\). So Xavier is now two years\nold.\n\nIf Xavier is twice as old as Yvonne and half the square of her age,\nhow old is each? This is more complicated than the previous example in\nthree respects: it has more unknowns, more equations, and terms of\nhigher degree. We may take \\(x\\) for Xavier\u2019s age and \\(y\\) for\nYvonne\u2019s age. The two constraints may be formalized as the\nequations \\(x = 2y\\) and \\(x = y^2 /2\\), the latter being of degree 2\nor quadratic.\n\nSince both right hand sides are equal to \\(x\\) we can infer \\(2y = y^2\n/2\\). It is tempting to divide both sides by \\(y\\), but what if \\(y =\n0\\)? In fact \\(y = 0\\) is one solution, for which \\(x = 2y = 0\\) as\nwell, corresponding to Xavier and Yvonne both being newborns. Setting\nthat solution to one side we can now look for solutions in which \\(y\\)\nis not zero by dividing both sides by \\(y\\). This yields \\(y = 4\\), in\nwhich case \\(x = 2y = 8\\). So now we have a second solution in which\nXavier is eight years old and Yvonne four.\n\nIn the absence of any other information, both solutions are\nlegitimate. Had the problem further specified that Yvonne was a\ntoddler, or that Xavier was older than Yvonne, we could have ruled out\nthe first solution.\n",
