Conclusion\n\nA close study of the syntax and semantics of natural language suggests\nthat constructions of the form \u2018the F\u2019 and\n\u2018an F\u2019 are not only rare in natural languages,\nbut potentially misleading in languages like English. These\nexpressions really don\u2019t carry out the logical roles that\nRussell and subsequent authors have thought. However, Russell\u2019s\ncore insight remains intact: The critical question is whether the\nsentences in which they appear are quantificational or referential,\nand Russell may well be right about the critical cases here. That is,\nmany apparently referential constructions may in fact be\nquantificational. What Russell didn\u2019t see was that surface\ngrammar is more deceptive than even he realized. Elements like\n\u2018the\u2019 and \u2018a\u2019 do not directly encode\nquantifiers or uniqueness clauses. The task for philosophers of\nlanguage now is the thorny task of figuring out what information they\ndo encode.\n",
