    "main_text": "Physics: The Pre-Critical Period\n1. Physics: The Pre-Critical Period\n\nKant\u2019s early pre-Critical publications aim to solve a variety of\nbroadly cosmological problems, and to develop an increasingly\ncomprehensive metaphysics that would ground the matter theory required\nby the solutions to these problems. Kant\u2019s first publication,\nThoughts on the True Estimation of Living Forces (1746),\nexplicitly attempts to solve the vis viva controversy, which\nhad been hotly contested ever since Leibniz\u2019s 1686 attack on\nDescartes\u2019 laws of motion. While Kant attempts to occupy an\nintermediary position between the Cartesian and Leibnizian positions\nby maintaining that both mv and mv\u00b2 could be\nconserved in different contexts, what is of particular note is how his\nsolution in Parts II and III rests on the conception of force\ndeveloped in Part I. According to this conception, force is understood\nin terms of the activity of substances, an activity that Kant then\nuses to explain how the motions of bodies are generated, to solve the\nmind-body problem, and to account for both the possibility of other,\nactually existing worlds and the three-dimensionality of space.\n\nHis solution to the vis viva dispute is especially\ninteresting, because it presages his later approach to philosophical\ncontroversy. Rather than offering a conclusive argument in favor of\none position, Kant seeks to mediate between the two parties,\nLeibnizian and Cartesian. He argues that each measure of force is\ncorrect, but in different contexts. Kant distinguishes two ways of\nstudying bodies, \u201cmathematical\u201d and\n\u201cmetaphysical,\u201d and claims that they presuppose distinct\nconceptions of body. According to mathematical mechanics, a body\ncannot accelerate unless an external cause acts on it; for that\nreason, Kant declares, the Cartesians\u2019 quantity\nmv is the only one appropriate measure of\nforce in this context. \u201cNatural bodies,\u201d in contrast, have\nfeatures that mathematics brackets. One such feature is a capacity for\n\u201cvivification,\u201d whereby a body increases by itself the\nforce of motion that an external cause merely \u201cawakens.\u201d\nIn light of that, Kant concludes, the Leibnizian quantity\nmv2 is the correct measure of force in\nmetaphysical considerations of \u201cnatural bodies\u201d\n(1:140f).\n\nKant develops his account of the nature of substance in greater detail\nin A New Elucidation of the First Principles of\nMetaphysical Cognition (1755). While the first two sections of\nthis work undertake revisions of Wolff\u2019s principles of\nnon-contradiction and sufficient reason, the third section argues for\ntwo substantive principles that are alleged to follow from the\nprinciple of sufficient (or rather, following Crusius, determining)\nreason, namely the principles of succession and coexistence. The main\nthrust of the principle of succession is directed against Leibnizian\npre-established harmony, arguing that only causal connections\nbetween substances can bring about changes in their states.\nKant\u2019s position appears to be designed to account primarily for\nchanges of bodily states (with changes in mental states being\nparasitic upon them, as was explicitly asserted in the True\nEstimation). For he maintains that mutual changes of\nstate require mutual interaction, where it is clear that\nchanges in motion are precisely the kind of mutual change that he has\nin mind (since one body cannot move closer to another without the\nother body moving closer to it). The principle of coexistence then\nargues that harmonious causal interaction between otherwise isolated,\nindependently existing substances is possible only by means of\nGod\u2019s coordination (just as Leibniz thought was required for\nharmonious relations between the states of such\nsubstances).\n\nKant\u2019s Physical Monadology (1756) articulates a theory\nof matter that can reconcile the infinite divisibility of space, as\nmaintained in geometry, with the simplicity of substances, which Kant\nbelieves is required in metaphysics. As was the case with his earlier\nworks, the essential feature of his reconciliation lies in the way in\nwhich his matter theory is supported by his metaphysical views.\nSpecifically, Kant asserts that simple substances fill space not by\nmeans of their mere existence, but rather in virtue of their spheres\nof activity. As a result, any division of the relevant spheres of\nactivity does not compromise the simplicity of the substances\nthemselves, since the spatial properties of substances (including the\ninfinite divisibility of space) arise from the interaction between\ntheir activities rather than from their intrinsic features. In the\ncourse of the Physical Monadology, Kant also argues for the\nnecessity of attractive and repulsive forces and attributes a\nsignificant role to the force of inertia. Kant\u2019s acceptance of\nsuch Newtonian principles represents an important change of position\nover the True Estimation, where Kant rejects the principle of\ninertia and pursues a dynamical theory much more in line with\nLeibniz\u2019s views.\n\nLater in his pre-Critical period (1763\u201370), Kant attempts to build a\ncomprehensive metaphysical account on the basis of the framework that\nhe had established in his first works. Thus, in his The Only\nPossible Basis for a Demonstration of the Existence of God (1763)\nhe attempts to extend his reasoning to fundamental issues in both\nphilosophical theology and teleology, presenting, for the first time,\nhis now famous criticisms of the three traditional arguments for the\nexistence of God, while developing a new theistic proof, based on the\nidea that God is necessary as a real ground of the possibilities of\nthings. After reading Hume\u2019s Enquiry concerning Human\nUnderstanding in German translation sometime after 1755, Kant\ndistinguishes between real and logical grounds/opposition in his\nAttempt to Introduce the Concept of Negative Magnitudes into\nPhilosophy (1763) to avoid Hume\u2019s objection that there is\nno logical contradiction in the existence of one thing not following\nthe existence of another. But in this work he is also interested in\nexploring the notion of a real ground/opposition further by applying\nit more widely, e.g., to bodies, mental states, etc. Also relevant is\nKant\u2019s Concerning the Ultimate Foundation of the Distinction\nof the Directions in Space (1768) which modifies his earlier\naccount of space insofar as he seems to hold that certain spatial\nproperties \u2014 viz., chirality, or handedness \u2014 may not be\nable to be explained entirely in terms of direct relations between\nmaterial substances. In his so-called Inaugural Dissertation\n(1770), Kant continues to develop a more comprehensive philosophical\nsystem, which would encompass the principles of both the sensible and\nthe intelligible world, and in so doing modifies his account of space\nand time even further. Over the course of the next ten years, during\nwhich he published almost nothing, Kant would revise his views more\nsystematically, with the publication of the Critique of Pure\nReason in 1781 representing the first major step in his\n\u201ccritical turn.\u201d\n\nAdickes (1924), Harman (1982), Friedman (1992), Laywine (1993),\nSch\u00f6nfeld (2000), Kuehn (2001), Lefevre & Wunderlich (2000),\nand Watkins (1997, 2001, 2003, 2006, 2013) have emphasized the\nimportance of scientific issues in the development of Kant\u2019s\nthought during his pre-Critical period, as he reacted to Leibniz,\nNewton and other, more immediate predecessors (such as Christian\nWolff, Chr. A. Crusius, Leonhard Euler, Maupertuis, and Martin\nKnutzen). Smith (2013) reconstructs Kant\u2019s picture of matter in\nthe Physical Monadology.\n",
