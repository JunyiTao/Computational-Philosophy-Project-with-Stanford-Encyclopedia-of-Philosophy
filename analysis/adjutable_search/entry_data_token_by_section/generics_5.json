    "main_text": "Generics and Logical Form || The Logical Form of Characterizing Generics\n1.5 The Logical Form of Characterizing Generics\n\nFor the remainder of this entry, we will be concerned only with\ncharacterizing generics, since they have received the most attention,\nand been the subject of most controversy. Henceforth, we will use the\nterm \u201cgenerics\u201d to mean specifically characterizing\ngenerics. This section discusses the dominant theory of the logical\nform of characterizing generics, and of necessity involves some\ntechnical material.\n\nIt is generally agreed nowadays that, contra Carlson\u2019s earliest\nwork, there is a two-place operator, usually termed Gen,\nwhich functions as an adverb of quantification (Lewis 1975). Adverbs\nof quantification include \u201cusually\u201d,\n\u201cgenerally\u201d, \u201ctypically\u201d,\n\u201calways\u201d, \u201csometimes\u201d, and so on. They\nfunction to relate one set of conditions containing at least one free\nvariable to another set. Adverbs of quantification are, in\nLewis\u2019s sense, unselective, meaning that they bind any number of\nfree variables in the sentence, be they objects, events, or locations.\nConsider, for example, the following sentence:\n\n(27)\nWhen m and n are positive integers, the power\n\\(m^n\\) can always be computed by successive multiplication.\n\n\nFollowing Lewis (1975), we should understand \u201calways\u201d as\nrelating the material in the when-clause to the material in the main\nclause in following way:\n\n(28)\nAlways m, n [m and n are\npositive integers] [the power \\(m^n\\) can be computed by successive\nmultiplication]\n\n\nThis representation is based on Lewis\u2019s (1975) paper, and is\nsaid to be a tripartite structure, consisting of a quantifier\nQ, a Restrictor R (picking out the domain of\nQ), and the Scope S, also called the matrix (picking\nout the properties attributed to Q elements of R).\nTripartite structures take the form \u201cQ [R]\n[S]\u201d. The sentence represented by the tripartite\nstructure is true iff Q Rs satisfy S.\n\nIn the above examples\n (27)\n and\n (28),\n the material from the when-clause is placed in the Restrictor, and\nthe material from the main clause is placed in the Scope. There are\ntwo free variables in the Restrictor, namely m and\nn, and so both are bound by the adverb of quantification\n\u201calways\u201d, which is naturally understood as a universal\nquantifier.\n\nGenerics are most commonly assimilated to this model\n(but see Nguyen, 2020). Carlson himself (1989)\nrejected his original one-place generic operator, on the grounds that\nit could not capture ambiguities as well as a two-place operator. He\nconsiders the following sentence:\n\n(29)\nTyphoons arise in this part of the Pacific.\n\n\nThis has two distinct generic readings, which can be paraphrased as\nfollows:\n\n(30)\nTyphoons in general have a common origin in this part of the\npacific.\n(31)\nThere arise typhoons in this part of the Pacific.\n\n\nIt would be a mistake to take the latter reading to be an existential\nreading: it does not simply mean that there are some particular\ntyphoons that originated in the relevant location, but rather seems to\nbe saying something general about the relevant location: situations\ninvolving that location are\u2014with sufficient\nregularity\u2014situations involving the arising of typhoons. A\ndyadic non-selective operator can easily accommodate both\nreadings:\n\n(32)\n\\(\\textit{Gen } x [\\textrm{Typhoon}(x)]\n[\\textrm{Arises-in-this-part-of-the-pacific}(x)]\\)\n(33)\n\\(\\textit{Gen } s [\\textrm{In-this-part-of-the-pacific}(s)]\n\\exists y [\\textrm{Typhoon}(y)\\ \\mathbin{\\&}\\)\n\\(\\textrm{Arises-in}(y, s)]\\)\n\n\nThe monadic operator can only yield the first (less natural)\ninterpretation: \n\\[G'(\\textrm{arises-in-this-part-of-the-pacific}(x))(\\textrm{typhoons}).\\]\n\n\nSchubert and Pelletier (1987) also offer compelling arguments in favor\nof a dyadic generic operator.\n\nIn keeping with this proposal, a common assumption (Heim 1982; Kamp\n1981; Kamp and Reyle 1993; Diesing 1992; Kratzer 1995; and many\nothers) is that indefinites such as bare plurals and indefinite\nsingulars contribute predicates with unbound variables to the logical\nforms containing them. In the course of syntactic operations, the\nmaterial in the sentence is divided up into the restrictor and scope\n(e.g., Diesing 1992). If the sentence contains a quantificational\nadverb (e.g., \u201cusually\u201d, \u201calways\u201d), then any\nunbound variables in the restrictor are bound by that quantificational\nadverb, as in example\n (28)\n above. However, if there is no quantificational adverb, the generic\noperator Gen is introduced to bind those variables. Thus, to\ntake a simple example, the logical form of a sentence like\n\u201cravens are black\u201d may be given as follows:\n\n(34)\nGen x [Ravens(x)]\n[Black(x)]\n\n\nEven theorists who do not agree with the assumption that indefinites\ncontribute just predicates and unbound variables to their logical\nforms (see, e.g., Chierchia 1998) tend to agree that a tripartite\nstructure nonetheless is the correct analysis for generics. One\nnotable exception is David Liebesman (2011), who argues that\ncharacterizing generics are themselves direct kind\npredications\u2014that, e.g., \u201ctigers have stripes\u201d is\nbest understood as simply the attribution of the predicate \u201chave\nstripes\u201d to the kind tigers. (See also Cohen 2012;\nTeichman 2016. Cohen argues that although pragmatic factors lead many\ngenerics to ultimately receive reinterpretations involving Gen,\ngenerics are always in the first instance kind predications.) It is\nnot clear, however, whether a view such as Liebesman\u2019s is able\nto account for the full range of semantic data. Recall that sentences\nsuch as \u201ccats lick themselves\u201d led Carlson (1977) to\nintroduce a G\u2018 operator to capture the dominant interpretation,\nnamely that individual cats lick themselves (i.e., their own\nbodies)\u2014an interpretation which is not captured by the logical\nform Lick(cats, cats). Similar complications arise for generics\ninvolving so-called donkey anaphora, e.g., \u201clions that see a\ngazelle chase it\u201d. Without the additional structure provided by\nan operator, it is not clear how these sentences can be adequately\ncaptured (Leslie 2015a).\n\nThe term \u201cgeneric\u201d is sometimes extended to sentences such\nas \u201cMary smokes after work\u201d, since these habitual\nstatements share various features with generics, although they do not\nexpress generalizations concerning kinds. It is often\nbelieved that these statements should be analyzed with Gen\n(e.g., Lawler 1972; Schubert and Pelletier 1989; Krifka et al. 1995,\nand many others):\n\n(35)\nGen e [Relevant-event-involving-Mary(e)\n& Occurs-after-work(e)]\n[Event-of-Mary-smoking(e)]\n\n\nFor the remainder of this entry, the term \u201chabitual\u201d\nrather than \u201cgeneric\u201d will be used for these\nstatements.\n",
