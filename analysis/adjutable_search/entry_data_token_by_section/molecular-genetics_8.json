This is true\nof the anti-reductionists, who seek to clarify why molecular genetics\ncannot reduce classical genetics, as well as those who have been more\nsympathetic to reductionism. Hence, there are two levels of discourse\nin the literature examining the question of whether molecular genetics\nis reducing classical genetics.  One level concerns what is happening\nin the science of genetics. The other concerns more abstract issues\nabout the nature of (epistemological) reduction.\n\n\nThe abstract level of discourse began with Schaffner's idea that what\nis reduced is not the original theory, but rather a corrected version\nof the original theory.  Wimsatt (1976a) offers a more ambitious\nmodification. He rejects the assumption that scientific theories are\nsets of law-like statements and that explanations are arguments in\nwhich the phenomena to-be-explained are derived from laws. Instead of\nrelying on these assumptions, Wimsatt uses Salmon's account of\nexplanation (Salmon 1971) to examine claims that molecular genetics\noffered reductive explanations. Kitcher (1984) also rejects the\naccount of theorizing underlying Nagel's concept of reduction. He\nconstructs a new concept of reductive explanation based on his own\nidea of what effectively constitutes a scientific theory and his\nunificationist account of scientific explanation (1989). Likewise,\nSarkar (1998) rejects the account of theories and explanation\npresupposed in Nagel's concept of reduction. In fact, he explicitly\navoids relying on any particular account of scientific theories or\ntheoretical explanation. Instead, he assumes that reductive\nexplanations are explanations without specifying what an explanation\nis, and then seeks to identify the features that set reductive\nexplanations apart from other explanations.\n\n\nWimsatt, Kitcher, and Sarkar seek to replace Nagel's conception of\nreduction with a conception that does not assume that scientic\nexplanation involves subsumption under universal laws. Weber (2005),\nhowever, seeks to replace Nagel's conception with one that retains the\nidea that reductive explanation involves subsumption under laws of the\nreducing science. What Weber rejects is the idea that reductionism in\nbiology involves explaining higher-level biological laws. He argues\nthat, with some rare exceptions, biological sciences don't have\nlaws. He contends that reductionism in biology involves explaining\nbiological phenomena directly in terms of physical laws. Hence, he\nrejects the \"layer-cake\" conception of reduction implicit in Nagel's\naccount.\n\n\nThe literature about reduction and molecular genetics has influenced\nphilosophers' thinking about reduction in other sciences. For example,\nKitcher's concept of reduction, which he uses to explain why molecular\ngenetics cannot reduce classical genetics, has subsequently been\nemployed by Hardcastle (1992) in her examination of the relationship\nbetween psychology and neuroscience. On the other side, Sober develops\nand extends the criticism of Kitcher's gory details objection (section 3.3) by re-examining the arguments of Putnam (1967, 1975) and Fodor\n(1968, 1975) on multiple-realizability.\n\n\nSober (1999) argues that higher-level sciences can describe patterns\ninvisible at lower level, and hence might offer more general\nexplanations. But he insists that description should not be confused\nwith explanation. He maintains that although physics might not be able\nto describe all the patterns, it can nevertheless\nexplain any singular occurrence that a higher-level science\ncan explain. Higher-level sciences might provide more \"general\"\nexplanations, but physics provides \"deeper\" ones. He suggests that\nwhich explanation is better is in the eye of the beholder. He\nconcludes that\n\n\n\u2026 reductionists might want to demure on this question of better\nand worse, and try to build on the bare proposition that physics in\nprinciple can explain wny singular occurrence that a higher-level\nscience is able to explain.  \u2026 For reductionists, the\ninteresting feature of physical explanations of social, psychological,\nand biological phenomena is that they use the same basic theoretical\nmachinery that is used to explain phenomena that are nonsocial,\nnonpsychological, and nonbiological (Sober 1999, pp. 560-1).\n\n\n\n\nThe discussion has gone full circle. The multiple-realizability\nargument being criticized by Sober was based on abstract\nconsiderations in the context of philosophy of mind. Philosophers of\nbiology drew on this literature to construct the gory details\nobjection against the idea that molecular genetics is reducing\nclassical genetics. Other philosophers argued that this objection did\nnot stand up to a careful analysis of the concrete situation in\ngenetics. Sober has developed lessons from the discussion about\ngenetics to critique the original anti-realizability argument and draw\ngeneral conclusions about reductionism. \n\n\nWimsatt's writings on reduction (1976a, 1976b, and 1979) emphasize the\nfruitfulness of attempting to achieve a reduction, even when a\nreduction is not achieved. He argues, for instance, that efforts to\ndiscover the molecular make-ups of entities identified at higher\nlevels is often fruitful, even when identities between levels cannot\nbe found. In addition, Wimsatt points out that the \u201ccosts\u201d\nof working out reductive explanations of the many particulars already\nexplained at a higher level are relevant to the question of why there\nis not a full-scale replacement of higher level explanations with\nlower level ones. Perhaps the fact that molecular genetics has not\nreplaced classical genetics can be explained on the basis of high\ncosts rather than lack of epistemic merit. \n\n\nWhile Schaffner still maintains that molecular genetics can in\nprinciple reduce classical genetics, he has conceded that attempts to\ncarry out the reduction would be \u201cperipheral\u201d to the\nadvance of molecular genetics. One might respond, along the lines of\nHull (1977), that the success of molecular genetics seems to be\nreductive in some important sense. Hence, the failure to illuminate\nthis success in terms of reduction reveals a conceptual defiency. That\nis, one might argue that Schaffner's peripherality thesis indicates\nthat his conception of reduction is not the epistemically relevant one\nbecause it cannot illuminate the fruitfulness of reductive inquiry in\nmolecular genetics.\n\n\nIn fact, a general shortcoming in the debate about the reduction of\nclassical genetics is that it concerns only a fragment of scientific\nreasoning. It is based almost exclusively on an analysis of\nexplanatory or theoretical reasoning and largely ignores investigative\nreasoning. The philosophical literature on the alleged reduction of\nclassical genetics focuses on how geneticists explain or try\nto explain phenomena, not how they manipulate or\ninvestigate phenomena. This is even true of Wimsatt's (1976a)\naccount of heuristics, which stress heuristics for explanation.\n\n\nVance (1996) offers a more thorough shift in attention from theory to\ninvestigative practice. He asserts that there is only one contemporary\nscience of genetics and describes how investigative methods of\nclassical genetics are an essential part of the methodology of what is\ncalled molecular genetics. He concludes that reductionism\nfails because contemporary genetics still depends on methods of\nclassical genetics involving breeding experiments.  Vance's picture of\ngenetics is compelling. The laboratory methods of classical genetics\ndo indeed persist, even as they are greatly extended, augmented, and\noften replaced by techniques involving direct intervention on DNA. But\nVance's picture does not match the anti-reductionist image of a\ntwo-tiered science and the contention that classical genetics will\nremain aloof from the reductive grasp of molecular biology.\n\n\nA different image emerges from viewing genetics as an investigative\nscience involving an interplay of methodological and explanatory\nreasoning (Waters 2004a). This image is not of a two-tiered science,\none (classical genetics) aimed at investigating and explaining\ntransmission phenomena and another (molecular genetics) aimed at\ninvestigating and explaining developmental phenomena. Instead, there\nis one science that retains much of the investigative and explanatory\nreasoning of classical genetics by re-conceptualizing its theoretical\nbasis in molecular terms and by retooling its basic investigative\napproach by integrating methodologies of classical genetics with\nphysically-based methods of biochemistry and new methods based on\nrecombinant DNA and RNA interference technologies.\n",
