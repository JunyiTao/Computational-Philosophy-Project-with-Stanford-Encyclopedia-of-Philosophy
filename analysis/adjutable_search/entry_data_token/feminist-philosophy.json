Overseen by a board\nof feminist philosophers, this section primarily takes up feminist\nphilosophy of the twentieth and tweny-first century. It has three\nsubsections of entries (as can be seen in Table of Contents under\n\u201cfeminist philosophy\u201d): (1) approaches to feminist\nphilosophy, (2) feminist interventions in philosophy, and (3) feminist\nphilosophical topics. By \u201capproaches to feminist\nphilosophy\u201d we mean the main philosophical approaches such as\nanalytic, continental, psychoanalytic, pragmatist, and various\nintersections. We see these as methodologies that can be\nfruitfully employed to engage philosophically isssues of feminist\nconcern. The second group of entries, feminist interventions in\nphilosophy, includes entries on how feminist philosophers have\nintervened in and begun to transform traditional philosopical areas\nsuch as aesthetics, ethics, the history of philosophy, metaphysics,\nand political philosophy. Entries in the third group, feminist\nphilosophical topics, take up concepts and matters that traditional\nphilosophy has either overlooked or undertheorized, including\nautonomy, the body, objectification, sex and gender, and reproduction.\nIn short, this third group of entries shows how feminist philosophers\nhave rendered philosophical previously un-problematized topics, such\nas the body, class and work, disability, the family, human\ntrafficking, reproduction, the self, sex work, and sexuality. Entries\nin this third group also show how a particularly feminist lens\nrefashions issues of globalization, human rights, popular culture,\nrace and racism, and science. Following a brief overview of feminism\nas a political and intellectual movement, we provide an overview of\nthese three parts of the feminist section of the SEP.\n\nIn addition to the feminist philosophy section of the SEP, there are\nalso a number of entries on women in the history of philosophy, for\nexample, on\n Mary Wollstonecraft,\n Mary Astell,\n Jane Addams,\n Rosa Luxemburg,\n Simone de Beauvoir,\n Iris Murdoch, and others. Additionally, dozens of other entries\nthroughout the SEP discuss facets of feminist philosophy, including,\nto name just a handful, the entries on\n global justice,\n respect,\n contemporary Africana philosophy,\n multiculturalism,\n privacy,\n and\n Latinx philosophy.\n", "toc": [{"#Intr": "1.

What is Feminism?\n\nBroadly understood, feminism is both an intellectual commitment and a\npolitical movement that seeks an end to gender-based oppression.\nMotivated by the quest for social justice, feminist inquiry provides a\nwide range of perspectives on cultural, economic, social, and\npolitical phenomena. It identifies and evaluates the many ways that\nsome norms have been used to exclude, marginalize, and oppress people\non the basis of gender, as well as how gendered dentities have been\nshaped to conform and uphold the norms of a patriarchal society. In so\ndoing, it tries to understand the roots of a system that has been\nprevalent in nearly all known places and times. It also explores what\na just society would look like.\n\nWhile less frequently than one would think, throughout history women\nhave rebelled against repressive structures. It was not until the late\n19th century that feminism coalesced into a movement. In the mid-1800s\nthe term feminism was still used to refer to \u201cthe\nqualities of females.\u201d After the First International\nWomen\u2019s Conference in Paris in 1892, the term feminism,\nfollowing the French term f\u00e9ministe, was used\nregularly in English for a belief in and advocacy of equal rights for\nwomen based on the idea of the equality of the sexes. Hence the term\nfeminism in English is rooted in the mobilization for\nwomen\u2019s suffrage in Europe and the United States during the late\nnineteenth and early twentieth century.\n\nAs a term, feminism has many different uses and its meanings\nare often contested. For example, some writers use the term to refer\nto a historically specific political movement in the United States and\nEurope; other writers use it to refer to the belief that there are\ninjustices against women, though there is no consensus on the exact\nlist of these injustices. Some have found it useful, if controversial,\nto think of the women\u2019s movement in the United States as\noccurring in \u201cwaves.\u201d The wave model has some virtues, but\nit also tends to overlook a great deal of heterogeneity of thought in\nany given moment. It works well enough for what is thought of as the\nfirst wave, identified as the period from the mid-nineteenth century\nuntil the passage of the Nineteenth Amendment in 1920. This first wave\nfocused on the struggle to achieve basic political rights. According\nto the wave model, feminism in the United States waned after women\nachieved voting rights, to be revived in the late 1960s and early\n1970s as \u201csecond wave\u201d feminism. In this second wave, the\nmodel holds, feminists pushed beyond the early quest for political\nrights to fight for greater equality across the board, e.g., in\neducation, the workplace, and at home. But in actuality, many\nfeminists during this time were focusing on more than equality. Like\nthe first wave, many of the leaders of the second wave of feminism\nwere white women seeking equal rights. But also, as in the first wave,\nother voices emerged, broadening the movement. The second wave came to\ninclude women of different identities, ethnicities, and orientations.\nIn addition to calling for equal political rights, they called for\ngreater equality across the board, e.g., in education, the workplace,\nand at home. Transformations of feminism beginning in the 1990s have\nresulted in a \u201cthird wave.\u201d Third Wave feminists often\ncritique earlier feminists for their lack of attention to the\ndifferences among women due to class, ethnicity, nationality,\nreligion, and race (see Breines 2002; Springer 2002), and emphasize\n\u201cidentity\u201d as a site of gender struggle. (For more\ninformation on the \u201cwave\u201d model and each of the\n\u201cwaves,\u201d see the subsection on \nWaves of Feminism in the Other Internet\nResources section.)\n\nSome feminist scholars object to identifying feminism in terms of\nwaves on the grounds that doing so eclipses differences within each\nwave as well as continuity of feminist resistance to male domination\nthroughout history and across cultures. In other words, feminism is\nnot confined to a few (white) women in the West over the past century\nor so. Moreover, even considering only relatively recent efforts to\nresist male domination in Europe and the United States, the emphasis\non \u201cFirst\u201d and \u201cSecond\u201d Wave feminism ignores\nthe ongoing resistance to male domination between the 1920s and 1960s\nand the resistance outside mainstream politics, particularly by women\nof color and working class women (Cott 1987). The wave model also\ncannot account for theoretical work taking place between waves, for\nexample, of the tremendous work done by Simone de Beauvoir in her\ngroundbreaking book of 1949, The Second Sex. Because of these\nmany limitiations of the wave model, the feminist section of the SEP\nmakes little use of it.\n\nAlthough the term feminism has a history in English linked\nwith women\u2019s activism from the late nineteenth century to the\npresent, it is useful to distinguish feminist ideas or beliefs from\nfeminist political movements, for even in periods where there has been\nno significant political activism around women\u2019s subordination,\nindividuals have been concerned with and theorized about justice for\nwomen. So, for example, it makes sense to ask whether Plato was a\nfeminist, given his view that some women should be trained to rule\n(Republic, Book V), even though he was an exception in his\nhistorical context (see, e.g., Tuana 1994). Overall, feminism can be\nunderstood as not only a social movement but also a set of beliefs,\nconcepts, and theories that seek to analyze, diagnose, and identify\nsolutions to the manifold injustices that people suffer on account of\ngendered noirms Broadly understood, this is feminism as a intellectual\nmovement. The SEP feminist section aims to chronicle and explain the\nvarious theories, concepts, and philosophical tools that feminist\nphilosophers have developed.\n\nMuch has been made of the methodological differences or\n\u201cdivides\u201d between various philosophical traditions, namely\nanalytic and continental, but also pragmatist and psychoanalytic. But\nthroughout these entries the reader will find a continuity of\ndescriptions on the meaning of feminism, even with the heterogeneity\nof the philosophical methodologies these entries\u2019 authors\nemploy. The entry on feminist ethics, written by the analytic feminist\nphilosopher Kathryn Norlock, describes that field in a way that is\nagreeable to almost any feminist philosopher:\n\n\nFeminist Ethics aims \u201cto understand, criticize, and\ncorrect\u201d how gender operates within our moral beliefs and\npractices (Lindemann 2005, 11) and our methodological approaches to\nethical theory. More specifically, feminist ethicists aim to\nunderstand, criticize, and correct: (1) the binary view of gender, (2)\nthe privilege historically available to men, and/or (3) the ways that\nviews about gender maintain oppressive social orders or practices that\nharm others, especially girls and women who historically have been\nsubordinated along gendered dimensions including sexuality and\ngender-identity. (entry on\n feminist ethics,\n introduction)\n\n\nLikewise, the entry on feminist perspectives on power, written by the\ncritical theorist Amy Allen, proposes the idea that \u201calthough\nany general definition of feminism would no doubt be controversial, it\nseems undeniable that much work in feminist theory is devoted to the\ntasks of critiquing gender subordination, analyzing its intersections\nwith other forms of subordination such as racism, heterosexism, and\nclass oppression, and envisioning prospects for individual and\ncollective resistance and emancipation.\u201d (entry on\n feminist perspectives on power,\n introduction)\n\nEven with general overall shared commitments about the meaning of\nfeminism, numerous differences among feminist philosophers do show up\nin the array of arenas outlined in this section of the SEP. Some of\nthese may be due to different methodological approaches (whether, for\nexample, continental or analytic), but others show up because of\ndifferent ontological commitments (such as the category of woman) and\nbeliefs about what kind of political and moral remedies should be\nsought.\n\nNonetheless, over the decades there has been a lot of frustration,\nperhaps because as philosophers these feminist theorists often want to\nget to the (one) truth of the matter, for example, what is \u201ca\nwoman\u201d? What is freedom? What is autonomy? Yet so far any search\nfor a unified or unifying theory of feminism has yet to bear fruit.\nConsider the seemingly unproblematic claim that feminism is a\ncommitment to women\u2019s equal rights. Perhaps it is, but framing\nit this way comes with its own presuppositions. The first is that\nfeminism is committed to a liberal model of politics. Although most\nfeminists would probably agree that there is some sense of rights on\nwhich achieving equal rights for women is a necessary condition for\nfeminism to succeed, most would also argue that this would not be\nsufficient. This is because women\u2019s oppression under male\ndomination rarely if ever consists solely in depriving women of\npolitical and legal rights, but also extends into the structure of our\nsociety and the content of our culture, and the workings of languages\nand how they shape perceptions and permeate our consciousness (e.g.,\nBartky 1988, Postl 2017). A second presupposition is that there is\nsome clear and universal definition of what it is to be a woman. The\nSEP entry, Feminist Perspectives on Sex and Gender, gives a rich\noverview of what is problematic about this supposition. Any attempt to\ndefine \u201cwoman,\u201d according to Judith Butler, is also an\nattempt to exclude some from that category. More recently this debate\nshows up in discussions about nonbinary and trans people. Previously,\nit showed up in suppositions that the typical subject of feminism was\nwhite and middle class. While feminism would be easier to theorize if\nit were clear who its subject is, any attempt to define it runs into\ntrouble. (see the entry on\n feminist perspectives on trans issues)\n\nIs there any point, then, in asking what feminism is? Rather than\nlooking for a unified field theory of feminism, perhaps feminism can\nbe identified as an engagement precisely where there are\ncontradictions over questions of freedom, identity, and agency. These\ncontradictions are not just logical ones but also historical ones. For\nexample, the question of women\u2019s political equality to men arose\nprecisely at those historical moments when \u201call men\u201d came\nto be deemed as equal (McAfee 2021). During the French Revolution, the\nFrench settled the matter by saying that \u201cmen\u201d meant men\nand not women. In the American Revolution, \u201cmen\u201d was not\nso clearly gendered but it was certainly raced as white. Equality\nbecomes an issue precisely where there is a disjunct between what\nseems to be the case normatively and what is happening empirically.\nQuestions about the category of women arise in the context of\npolitical diversity and biological malleability, where peoples of many\ncultures mingle and sexual or gender identity can be altered. Feminist\ndebates over pornography and sex work become heated in the context,\nrespectively, of a free press and economic precarity. In short,\nfeminist inquiry arises in the context of disagreement and\ncontradiction and it produces new ways of approaching issues and\nasking questions. Thus, that it lacks a cohesive set of answers may be\nbeside the point.\n\nIn sum, \u201cfeminism\u201d is an umbrella term for a range of\nviews about injustices against women. There are disagreements among\nfeminists about the nature of justice in general and the nature of\nsexism, in particular, the specific kinds of injustice or wrong women\nsuffer; and the group who should be the primary focus of feminist\nefforts. Nonetheless, feminists are committed to bringing about social\nchange to end injustice against women, in particular, injustice\nagainst women as women.\n2. Feminist Scholarship\n\nContemporary feminist philosophical scholarship emerged in the 1970s\nas more women began careers in higher education, including philosophy.\nAs they did so, they also began taking up matters from their own\nexperience for philosophical scrutiny. These scholars were influenced\nboth by feminist movements in their midst as well as by their\nphilosophical training, which generally was anything but feminist.\nUntil about the 1990s, one could not go to graduate school to study\n\u201cfeminist philosophy.\u201d While students and scholars could\nturn to the writings of Simone de Beauvoir or look back historically\nto the writings of \u201cfirst wave\u201d feminists like Mary\nWollstonecraft, most of the philosophers writing in the first decades\nof the emergence of feminist philosophy brought their particular\ntraining and expertise to bear on analyzing issues raised by the\nwomen\u2019s liberation movement of the 1960s and 1970s, such as\nabortion, affirmative action, equal opportunity, the institutions of\nmarriage, sexuality, and love. Additionally, feminist philosophical\nscholarship increasingly focused on the very same types of issues\ntaken up by mainstream philosophers.\n\nFeminist philosophical scholarship begins with attention to women, and\nto limitations on their roles and locations and the ways they were\nvalued or devalued. It developed further by considering gender in less\nbinary terms as well as recognizing that gender is only one fact of\nthe complex interactions among class, race, ability, and sexuality.\nFeminist scholarship asks how attention to these might transform\nfeminist philosophy itself. From here we move to the realm of the\nsymbolic and how it constructs \u201cthe feminine.\u201d How is the\nfeminine instantiated and constructed within the texts of philosophy?\nWhat role does it play in forming, either through its absence or its\npresence, the central concepts of philosophy?\n\nFeminist philosophers brought their philosophical tools to bear on\nthese questions. Since these feminist philosophers employed the\nphilosophical tools they knew best and found most promising, feminist\nphilosophy began to emerge from all the traditions of Western\nphilosophy prevalent at the end of the twentieth century, including\nanalytic, continental, and classical American philosophy. While the\nthematic focus of their work was often influenced by the topics and\nquestions highlighted by these traditions, the larger shared feminist\nconcerns often create as much commonality as difference. Hence, a\ngiven question could be taken up and addressed from an array of views\nin ways that are sometimes divergent and at other times\ncomplementary.\n\nAs an historically male discipline, many of the leading philosophical\njournals and societies did not recognize much feminist scholarship as\nproperly philosophical. In response, feminist scholars began founding\ntheir own journals and organizations. The first leading feminist\njournal, Hypatia: A Journal of Feminist Philosophy, was\nfounded in 1982 as a venue for feminist philosophical scholarship. It\nembraced a diversity of methodological approaches in feminist\nphilosophy, publishing work from a variety of traditions. Feminist\nscholarship in each of these traditions is also advanced and supported\nthough scholarly exchange at various professional societies, including\nthe Society for Women in Philosophy, founded in the United States in\n1972. Additionally, the Society for Analytical Feminism, founded in\n1991, promotes the study of issues in feminism by methods broadly\nconstrued as analytic, to examine the use of analytic methods as\napplied to feminist issues, and to provide a means by which those\ninterested in analytical feminism can meet and exchange ideas. The\njournal philoSOPHIA was established in 2005 to promote\ncontinental feminist scholarly and pedagogical development. The\nSociety for the Study of Women Philosophers was established in 1987 to\npromote the study of the contributions of women to the history of\nphilosophy. Similar organizations and journals on many continents\ncontinue to advance scholarship in feminist philosophy. Often a\nfeminist philosophical society will publish its own journal, just as\nthe International Network on Feminist Approaches to Bioethics\npublishes the International Journal of Feminist Approaches to\nBioethics. While the discipline of philosophy in the West remains\npredominantly white and male, feminist journals and scholarship\ncontinues to proliferate.\n3. Approaches to Feminism\n\nImportant feminist philosophical work has emerged from all the current\nmajor philosophical traditions, including analytic philosophy,\ncontinental philosophy, and American pragmatist philosophy. It is also\nemerging from other new areas of inquiry, such as Latin American\nthought, which arises out of the context of colonialism. Entries in\nthe SEP under the heading \u201capproaches to feminism\u201d discuss\nthe impact of these traditions and constellations of thought on\nfeminist scholarship. The subsection also addresses how some work,\nsuch as psychoanalytic feminism, bridges two or more traditions. The\neditors of the feminist section of the SEP see these different\ntraditions as a rich array of methodologies rather than \u201ccontinental\ndivides.\u201d The array reflects a variety of beliefs about what kinds of\nphilosophy are both fruitful and meaningful. The different\nmethodologies bring their own ways of asking and answering questions,\nalong with constructive and critical dialogue with mainstream\nphilosophical views and methods and new topics of inquiry. \n\nAs the SEP continues to grow, we anticipate that this subsection on\napproaches to feminism will expand to address other traditions,\nincluding Black feminism. But for now, here are links to entries in\nthis subsection:\n\nanalytic feminism\ncontinental feminism\nLatin American feminism\npragmatist feminism\nintersections between pragmatist and continental feminism\nintersections between analytic and continental feminism\npsychoanalytic feminism\n\n\nThough not included along with these in the table of contents, another\nrelevant approach can be found in the entry on\n gender in Confucian philosophy.\n\nAll these approaches share a set of feminist commitments and an\noverarching criticism of institutions, presuppositions, and practices\nthat have historically favored men over women. They also share a\ngeneral critique of claims to universality and objectivity that ignore\nmale-dominated theories\u2019 own particularity and specificity.\nFeminist philosophies of almost any philosophical orientation will be\nmuch more perspectival, historical, contextual, and focused on lived\nexperience than their non-feminist counterparts. Unlike mainstream\nphilosophers who can seriously consider the philosophical conundrums\nof brains in a vat, feminist philosophers always start by seeing\npeople as embodied. Feminists have also argued for the reconfiguration\nof accepted structures and problems of philosophy. For example,\nfeminists have not only rejected the privileging of epistemological\nconcerns over moral and political concerns common to much of\nphilosophy, they have argued that these two areas of concern are\ninextricably intertwined. Part 2 of the entry on\n analytic feminism\n lays out other areas of commonality across these various approaches.\nFor one, feminist philosophers generally agree that philosophy is a\npowerful tool for, as Ann Garry states in that entry,\n\u201cunderstanding ourselves and our relations to each other, to our\ncommunities, and to the state; to appreciate the extent to which we\nare counted as knowers and moral agents; [and] to uncover the\nassumptions and methods of various bodies of knowledge.\u201d As\nsuch, philosophy is also a powerful tool for understanding how gender\nitself has been constructed, that is, why and to whose benefit it is\nto construct some people as lesser and less capable than others. Along\nthese lines, feminist philosophers are keenly attuned to male biases\nat work in the history of philosophy, such as those regarding\n\u201cthe nature of woman\u201d and supposed value neutrality, which\non inspection is hardly neutral at all. Claims to universality,\nfeminist philosophers have found, are usually made from a very\nspecific and particular point of view, contrary to their manifest\nassertions. Another orientation that feminist philosophers generally\nshare is a commitment to normativity and social change; they are never\ncontent to analyze things just as they are but instead look for ways\nto overcome oppressive practices and institutions.\n\nSuch questioning of the problems of mainstream approaches to\nphilosophy has often led to feminists using methods and approaches\nfrom more than one philosophical tradition. As Ann Garry notes in Part\n3 of the entry on\n analytic feminism\n (2017), it is not uncommon to find analytic feminists drawing on\nnon-analytic figures such as Beauvoir, Foucault, or Butler; and\nbecause of their motivation to communicate with other feminists, they\nare more motivated than other philosophers \u201cto search for\nmethodological cross-fertilization.\u201d Moreover, feminist\nphilosophers are generally inclined to incorporate the perspectives of\nall those who have been oppressed.\n\nEven with their common and overlapping orientations, the differences\nbetween the various philosophical approaches to feminism are\nsignificant, especially in terms of styles of writing, influences, and\noverall expectations about what philosophy can and should achieve.\nAnalytic feminist philosophy tends to value analysis and\nargumentation, though anyone trained in philosophy does so as well.\nContinental feminist theory puts more emphasis on interpretation and\ndeconstruction, and pragmatist feminism values lived experience and\nexploration. Coming out of a post-Hegelian tradition, both continental\nand pragmatist philosophers usually suspect that \u201ctruth,\u201d\nwhatever that is, emerges and develops historically. They tend to\nshare with Nietzsche the view that truth claims often mask power\nplays. Yet where continental and pragmatist philosophers are generally\nwary about notions of truth, analytic feminists tend to argue that the\nway to \u201ccounter sexism and androcentrism is through forming a\nclear conception of and pursuing truth, logical consistency,\nobjectivity, rationality, justice, and the good.\u201d (Cudd 1996:\n20).\n\nThese differences and intersections play out in the ways that various\nfeminists engage topics of common concern. One key area of\nintersection, noted by Georgia Warnke, is the appropriation of\npsychoanalytic theory, with Anglo-American feminists generally\nadopting object-relations theories and continental feminists drawing\nmore on Lacan and contemporary French psychoanalytic theory, though\nthis is already beginning to change as it becomes clearer that\ncontinental psychoanalytic theory is also interested, via Julia\nKristeva and Melanie Klein, in object-relations theory (see the entry\non\n intersections between analytic and continental feminism).\n The importance of psychoanalytic approaches is also underscored in\nShannon Sullivan\u2019s entry on\n intersections between pragmatist and continental feminism.\n Given the importance of\n psychoanalytic feminism\n for all three traditions, a separate essay on this approach to\nfeminist theory is included in this section.\n\nNo topic is more central to feminist philosophy than sex and gender,\nbut even here many variations on the theme flourish. Where analytic\nfeminism, with its critique of essentialism, holds the sex/gender\ndistinction practically as an article of faith (see the entry on\n feminist perspectives on sex and gender\n and Chanter 2009), continental feminists tend to suspect either (1)\nthat even the supposedly purely biological category of sex is itself\nsocially constituted (Butler 1990 and 1993) or (2) that sexual\ndifference itself needs to be valued and theorized (see especially\nCixous 1976 and Irigaray 1974).\n\nDespite the variety of different approaches, styles, societies, and\norientations, feminist philosophers\u2019 commonalities are greater\nthan their differences. Many will borrow freely from each other and\nfind that other orientations contribute to their own work. Even the\ndifferences over sex and gender add to a larger conversation about the\nimpact of culture and society on bodies, experience, and pathways for\nchange.\n4. Interventions in Philosophy\n\nPhilosophers who are feminists have, in their work in traditional\nfields of study, begun to change those very fields. The\nEncyclopedia includes a range of entries on how feminist\nphilosophies have intervened in conventional areas of philosophical\nresearch, areas in which philosophers often tend to argue that they\nare operating from a neutral, universal point of view (notable\nexceptions are pragmatism, poststructuralism, and some phenomenology).\nHistorically, philosophy has claimed that the norm is universal and\nthe feminine is abnormal, that universality is not gendered, but that\nall things feminine are not universal. Not surprisingly, feminists\nhave pointed out how in fact these supposed neutral enterprises are in\nfact quite gendered, namely, male gendered. For example, feminists\nworking on environmental philosophy have uncovered how practices\ndisproportionately affect women, children, and people of color.\nLiberal feminism has shown how supposed universal truths of liberalism\nare in fact quite biased and particular. Feminist epistemologists have\ncalled out \u201cepistemologies of ignorance\u201d that traffic in\nnot knowing. Across the board, in fact, feminist philosophers are\nuncovering male biases and also pointing to the value of\nparticularity, in general rejecting universality as a norm or\ngoal.\n\nEntries under the heading of feminist interventions include the\nfollowing:\n\nfeminist aesthetics\n\nfeminist bioethics\n\nfeminist environmental philosophy\n\nfeminist epistemology and philosophy of science\n\nfeminist ethics\n\nfeminist history of philosophy\n\nliberal feminism\n\nfeminist metaphysics\n\nfeminist moral psychology\n\nfeminist philosophy of biology\n\nfeminist philosophy of language\n\nfeminist philosophy of law\n\nfeminist philosophy of religion\n\nfeminist political philosophy\n\nfeminist social epistemology\n\n\n5. Topics in Feminism\n\nFeminist critical attention to philosophical practices has revealed\nthe inadequacy of dominant philosophical tropes as well as the need to\nturn philosophical attention to things that had previously gone\nunattended. For example, feminists working from the perspective of\nwomen\u2019s lives have been influential in bringing philosophical\nattention to the phenomenon of care and care-giving (Ruddick 1989;\nHeld 1995, 2007; Hamington 2006), dependency (Kittay 1999), disability\n(Wilkerson 2002; Carlson 2009), women\u2019s labor (Waring 1999;\nDelphy 1984; Harley 2007), the devaluation of women\u2019s\ntestimonies (see the entry on\n feminist epistemology and philosophy of science),\n and scientific bias and objectivity (Longino 1990). In doing so they\nhave revealed weaknesses in existing ethical, political, and\nepistemological theories. More generally, feminists have called for\ninquiry into what are typically considered \u201cprivate\u201d\npractices and personal concerns, such as the family, sexuality, and\nthe body, in order to balance what has seemed to be a masculine\npre-occupation with \u201cpublic\u201d and impersonal matters.\nPhilosophy presupposes interpretive tools for understanding our\neveryday lives; feminist work in articulating additional dimensions of\nexperience and aspects of our practices is invaluable in demonstrating\nthe bias in existing tools, and in the search for better ones.\n\nFeminist explanations of sexism and accounts of sexist practices also\nraise issues that are within the domain of traditional philosophical\ninquiry. For example, in thinking about care, feminists have asked\nquestions about the nature of the self; in thinking about gender,\nfeminists have asked what the relationship is between the natural and\nthe social; in thinking about sexism in science, feminists have asked\nwhat should count as knowledge. In some such cases, mainstream\nphilosophical accounts provide useful tools; in other cases,\nalternative proposals have seemed more promising.\n\nIn the sub-entries included under \u201cfeminism (topics)\u201d in\nthe\n Table of Contents\n to this Encyclopedia, authors survey some of the recent\nfeminist work on a topic, highlighting the issues that are of\nparticular relevance to philosophy.
