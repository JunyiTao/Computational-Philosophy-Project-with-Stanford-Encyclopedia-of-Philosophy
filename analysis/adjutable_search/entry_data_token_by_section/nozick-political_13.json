    "main_text": "Justice in Holdings || The Rectification of Historical Injustices\n4.4 The Rectification of Historical Injustices\n\nNozick recognizes that even in relatively free societies the\nhistorical processes that have yielded existing holdings have been\nshot through with injustices. The history of almost all existing\nholdings includes lots of appropriation by way of murder, plunder,\nenslavement, fraudulent dealings, and other illicit coercive transfers\n(usually on behalf of the rich and powerful). We do not need a\ndelicately worked out theory of rectification in order to say that, if\nA has grabbed B\u2019s goat yesterday, he can be\nrequired to return it to B today. But we do need a highly\nelaborate theory to inform us about what rectification payments (if\nany) should now be required of whom on behalf of who else because of\ninjustices performed 20 or 50 or 200 years ago. Presumably any\nacceptable doctrine will require that only current victims of past\ninjustices have just claims to rectification payments and that they\nonly have just claims against current beneficiaries of those past\ninjustices. Perhaps, then, bygones should be treated as bygones when\nwe lack the information that a well-developed doctrine of\nrectification would require us to have to justly rectify long past\n injustices.[29]\n\nNozick closes chapter 7 with two thoughts concerning rectification.\nThe first is that proper rectification may have to take the form of\nrough and ready payments to classes of people whose members are likely\nto be worse off than they otherwise would be because of historical\ninjustices\u2014payments that would be funded by taxes upon classes\nof people whose members are likely to be better off than they\notherwise would be because of those historical injustices. The second\nis that some end-state principle might come into play as a guide for\nthese required payments\u2014albeit \u201cit may well be\nimplausible\u201d (231) to select the difference principle as this\nguide.\n",
