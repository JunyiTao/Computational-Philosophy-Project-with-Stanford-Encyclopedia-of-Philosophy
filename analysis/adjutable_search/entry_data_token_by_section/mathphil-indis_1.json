    "main_text": "What is it to be Indispensable?\n2. What is it to be Indispensable?\n\nThe question of how we should understand\n\u2018indispensability\u2019 in the present context is crucial to\nthe Quine-Putnam argument, and yet it has received surprisingly little\nattention. Quine actually speaks in terms of the entities quantified\nover in the canonical form of our best scientific theories rather than\nindispensability. Still, the debate continues in terms of\nindispensability, so we would be well served to clarify this term.\n\n\nThe first thing to note is that \u2018dispensability\u2019 is not\nthe same as \u2018eliminability\u2019. If this were not so,\nevery entity would be dispensable (due to a theorem of\n Craig).[3]\n What we require for an entity to be \u2018dispensable\u2019 is for\nit to be eliminable and that the theory resulting from the\nentity\u2019s elimination be an attractive theory. (Perhaps, even\nstronger, we require that the resulting theory be more\nattractive than the original.) We will need to spell out what counts\nas an attractive theory but for this we can appeal to the standard\ndesiderata for good scientific theories: empirical success;\nunificatory power; simplicity; explanatory power; fertility and so on.\nOf course there will be debate over what desiderata are appropriate\nand over their relative weightings, but such issues need to be\naddressed and resolved independently of issues of indispensability.\n(See Burgess (1983) and Colyvan (1999) for more on these issues.)\n\nThese issues naturally prompt the question of how much\nmathematics is indispensable (and hence how much mathematics carries\nontological commitment). It seems that the indispensability argument\nonly justifies belief in enough mathematics to serve the needs of\nscience. Thus we find Putnam speaking of \u201cthe set theoretic\n\u2018needs\u2019 of physics\u201d (Putnam 1979b, p. 346) and Quine\nclaiming that the higher reaches of set theory are \u201cmathematical\nrecreation ... without ontological rights\u201d (Quine 1986, p. 400)\nsince they do not find physical applications. One could take a less\nrestrictive line and claim that the higher reaches of set theory,\nalthough without physical applications, do carry ontological\ncommitment by virtue of the fact that they have applications in\nother parts of mathematics. So long as the chain of applications\neventually \u201cbottoms out\u201d in physical science, we could\nrightfully claim that the whole chain carries ontological commitment.\nQuine himself justifies some transfinite set theory along these lines\n(Quine 1984, p. 788), but he sees no reason to go beyond the\nconstructible sets (Quine 1986, p. 400). His reasons for this\nrestriction, however, have little to do with the indispensability\nargument and so supporters of this argument need not side with Quine\non this issue.\n",
