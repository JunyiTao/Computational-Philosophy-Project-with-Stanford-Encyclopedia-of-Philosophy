    "main_text": "Reasoning and Logic\n1. Reasoning and Logic\n\nHumans reason: that is, taking some things to be true, they conclude\ntherefrom that other things are also true. If this is done in thought,\none performs an inference; and if this is done in speech, one makes an\nargument. Indeed, inference and argument are but two sides of the same\ncoin: an argument can be thought, and hence become an inference; an\ninference can be expressed, and hence become an argument.\n\nLogic, at least as traditionally conceived, seeks to distinguish good\nreasoning from bad. More particularly, it seeks to identify the\ngeneral conditions under which what one concludes is true, having\ntaken other things to be true. These conditions can be sought in the\nnature of things. One asks, then, under what conditions do certain\nfacts require some other fact. This perspective on reasoning is an\nontic perspective. Next, insofar as facts are grasped in thought, one\ncan also ask under what conditions does knowledge of some facts permit\nknowledge of another fact. Such conditions, once identified, would\ndistinguish good inferences from bad inferences. This perspective on\nreasoning is an epistemic one. A third perspective is a dialectic one.\nHere one asks under what conditions does the acceptance by someone of\nsome stated facts require him or her to accept some other stated fact.\nSuch conditions distinguish good arguments from bad arguments.\nFinally, since an argument is an expression of an inference, and to\nthat extent, expressed in a language, it is natural to use the forms\nof linguistic expressions to identify forms of inferences and\narguments, thereby distinguishing forms of good inferences and\narguments from forms of bad inferences and arguments. This perspective\nis a linguistic one. The study of reasoning in India has been from the\nontic, epistemic and dialectic perspective, and not from the\nlinguistic perspective, the perspective best known to modern\nthinkers.\n",
