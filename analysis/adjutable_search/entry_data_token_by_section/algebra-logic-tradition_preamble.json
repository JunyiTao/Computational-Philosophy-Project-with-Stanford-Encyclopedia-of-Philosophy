    "main_text": "\n\nThe algebra of logic, as an explicit algebraic\nsystem showing the underlying mathematical structure of logic, was\nintroduced by George Boole (1815\u20131864) in his book The\nMathematical Analysis of Logic (1847). It is therefore to be\ndistinguished from the more general approach of algebraic\nlogic.  The methodology initiated by Boole was successfully\ncontinued in the 19th century in the work of William\nStanley Jevons (1835\u20131882), Charles Sanders Peirce\n(1839\u20131914), Ernst Schr\u00f6der (1841\u20131902), among many\nothers, thereby establishing a tradition in (mathematical) logic. From\nBoole\u2019s first book until the influence after WWI of the monumental\nwork Principia Mathematica (1910\u20131913) by Alfred North\nWhitehead (1861\u20131947) and Bertrand Russell (1872\u20131970),\nversions of the algebra of logic were the most developed form of\nmathematical logic above all as presented in Schr\u00f6der\u2019s three\nvolumes Vorlesungen \u00fcber die Algebra der Logik\n(1890\u20131905). Furthermore, this tradition motivated the\ninvestigations of Leopold L\u00f6wenheim (1878\u20131957) that\neventually gave rise to model theory. In addition, in 1941, Alfred\nTarski (1901\u20131983) in his paper \u201cOn the calculus of\nrelations\u201d returned to Peirce\u2019s relation algebra as presented in\nSchr\u00f6der\u2019s Algebra der Logik. The tradition of the\nalgebra of logic played a key role in the notion of Logic as\nCalculus as opposed to the notion of Logic as Universal\nLanguage. Beyond Tarski\u2019s algebra of relations, the influence of\nthe algebraic tradition in logic can be found in other mathematical\ntheories, such as category theory. However this influence lies outside\nthe scope of this entry, which is divided into 10 sections.\n",
