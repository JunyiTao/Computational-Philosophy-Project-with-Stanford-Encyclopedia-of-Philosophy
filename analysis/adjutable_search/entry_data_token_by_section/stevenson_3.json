    "main_text": "Ethics and Psychology || Moral Disagreement and Non-Cognitivism about Moral Judgment\n2.3 Moral Disagreement and Non-Cognitivism about Moral Judgment Are moral problems essentially disagreements or\nuncertainties in belief, attitude, or both? Are moral judgments\nconstituted by beliefs, attitudes, or both? Stevenson suggests that\nmoral problems almost always involve both types of disagreement or\nuncertainty (1944, 11; 1948b, 4). For example, consider an ethical\ndisagreement between a union representative and a company\nrepresentative over an increase in employee wages:\n\n\n\nSuch an argument clearly represents a disagreement in attitude. The\nunion is for higher wages; the company is against\nthem, and neither is content to let the other\u2019s attitude remain\nunchanged. In addition to this disagreement in attitude, of\ncourse, the argument may represent no little disagreement in belief.\nPerhaps the parties disagree about how much the cost of living has\nrisen and how much the workers are suffering under the present wage\nscale. Or perhaps they disagree about the company\u2019s earnings and the\nextent to which the company could raise wages and still operate at a\nprofit. Like any typical ethical argument, then, this argument\ninvolves both disagreement in attitude and disagreement in belief.\n(1948b, 4)\n\n\nHowever, although moral problems almost always involve both types of\ndisagreement or uncertainty, their distinguishing feature is\ndisagreement or uncertainty in attitude.\n\n\nIf the men come to agree in belief about all the factual matters they\nhave considered, and if they continue to have divergent aims in spite\nof this \u2026 they will still have an ethical issue that is\nunresolved. But if they come to agree [in attitude], they will have\nbrought their ethical issue to an end; and this will be so even though\nvarious beliefs \u2026 still remain debatable. Both men may conclude\nthat these remaining beliefs, no matter how they are later settled,\nwill have no decisive effect on their attitudes. (1944, 14\u201315;\nsee also 1948b, 6)\n\n\nStevenson accepts, then, non-cognitivism, a view according to\nwhich moral judgments are essentially constituted at least in part by\nattitudes and moral disagreement is essentially disagreement in\nattitude. Stevenson\u2019s main focus project is on developing, in\nsufficient detail, an attractive non-cognitivist account of moral\nproblems, rather than on arguing for the superiority of\nnon-cognitivism over the competing views (although see 1937; 1944, ch.\n12; 1950a). However, he does support his claim that moral\ndisagreements would essentially involve disagreement in attitude by\nconsidering a number of examples (e.g., 1944, 13\u201318; 1948b,\n3\u20134). In addition to the kinds of cases mentioned above,\nStevenson invites us to consider, for instance, a person who seems to\nbe fully persuaded that what he did was wrong and, for that very\nreason, is more in favor of doing it again:\n\n\nTemporarily puzzled to understand him, we shall be likely to conclude,\n\u2018This is his paradoxical way of abusing what he considers our\noutworn moral conventions. He means to say that it is really all right\nto do it, and that one ought to do it flagrantly in order to discredit\nthe many people who consider it wrong\u2019. But whatever we\nmay make of his meaning (and there are several other interpretations\npossible) we shall scarcely take seriously his protestations of\nagreement. Were we not trying all along to make him disapprove of his\naction? Would not his ethical agreement with us require that he share\nour disfavor\u2014that he agree with us in attitude? (1944,\n16\u201317)\n\n\nHere Stevenson seems to appeal to motivational internalism,\nor to the idea that, roughly, a moral judgment is necessarily\naccompanied with having some motivation to act accordingly (see\nSection 3.2 of the entry on\n moral motivation),\n or with a favorable attitude toward acting in the relevant way.\nIndeed, elsewhere Stevenson notes that \u201c\u2018goodness\u2019\nmust have, so to speak, a magnetism\u201d: a person who\n\u201crecognizes X to be good must ipso facto acquire a\nstronger tendency to act in its favour\u201d (1937, 16).\n\nInterestingly, Stevenson suggests that a point in favor of his\nnon-cognitivist or emotivist view is that it allows us to recognize\n\u201cthe cognitive content of ethics [...] in its full\nvariety\u201d\u2014that \u201can emotive conception of ethics, so\noften criticized for depriving ethics of its thoughtful, reflective\nelements, has actually just the opposite effect\u201d (1950a, 60).\nThe idea is a variation on Moore\u2019s (1903) Open Question Argument: Let\nus suppose that being good may be identified, as a matter of\nconceptual or meaning analysis, with having some descriptive feature,\nD\u2014being promotive of survival, say. If one now wishes\nto determine whether some action would be good, it turns out that one\nonly needs to consider its impact on the instantiation of\nDness. This may be part of what is cognitively relevant. But\nit is at least possible to deem all sorts of descriptive features as\nrelevant to determining what is good. And so most non-emotive accounts\n(Stevenson grants that there are exceptions) will be too restrictive\nregarding what may be deemed to be cognitively relevant to ethics\n(1950a, 60\u201363). One type of non-emotive view that would escape\nthis argument is Moorean non-naturalism, according to which moral\njudgments are beliefs concerning sui generis, non-natural\nproperties. Stevenson applauds such views for recognizing \u201can\nadded factor\u201d to the meaning of moral language that \u201cthe\npurely scientific analyses of ethics are accustomed to ignore,\u201d\nbut takes them to unnecessarily intellectualize the \u201cemotive\nmeaning into an indefinable quality\u201d (1944, 272).\n\nStevenson also appeals, in passing, to an argument from the best\nexplanation about the cause of the disparity of ethical views that\noften occur between people of widely different generations, ethnic or\ngeographic locations. According Stevenson, the disparity is adequately\nexplained if ethical disagreement were essentially disagreement in\nattitude, \u201cfor different temperaments, social needs, and group\npressures would more directly and urgently lead these people to have\nopposed attitudes than it would lead them to have opposed factual\nbeliefs\u201d (1944, 18).\n",
