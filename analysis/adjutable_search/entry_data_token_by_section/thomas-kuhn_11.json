    "main_text": "Criticism and Influence || Incommensurability\n6.2 Incommensurability\nKuhn\u2019s incommensurability thesis presented a challenge not only to\npositivist conceptions of scientific change but also to realist ones.\nFor a realist conception of scientific progress also wishes to assert\nthat, by and large, later science improves on earlier science, in\nparticular by approaching closer to the truth.  A standard realist\nresponse from the late 1960s was to reject the anti-realism and\nanti-referentialism shared by both Kuhn\u2019s picture and the preceding\ndouble-language model. If we do take theories to be potential\ndescriptions of the world, involving reference to worldly entities,\nkind, and properties, then the problems raised by incommensurability\nlargely evaporate. As we have seen, Kuhn thinks that we cannot\nproperly say that Einstein\u2019s theory is an improvement on Newton\u2019s in\nthe sense that the latter as deals reasonably accurately\n(only) with a special case of the former. Whether or not the key terms\n(such as \u2018mass\u2019) in the two theories differ in meaning, a\nrealist and referentialist approach to theories permits one to say\nthat Einstein\u2019s theory is closer to the truth than Newton\u2019s. For truth\nand nearness to the truth depend only on reference and not on\nsense. Two terms can differ in sense yet share the same reference, and\ncorrespondingly two sentences may relate to one another as regards\ntruth without their sharing terms with the same sense. And so even if\nwe retain a holism about the sense of theoretical terms and allow that\nrevolutions lead to shifts in sense, there is no direct inference from\nthis to a shift in reference. Consequently, there is no inference to\nthe inadmissibility of the comparison of theories with respect to\ntheir truth-nearness.\nWhile this referentialist response to the incommensurability thesis\nwas initially framed in Fregean terms (Scheffler 1967), it received\nfurther impetus from the work of Kripke (1980) and Putnam (1975b),\nwhich argued that reference could be achieved without anything akin to\nFregean sense and that the natural kind terms of science exemplified\nthis sense-free reference. In particular, causal theories of reference\npermit continuity of reference even through fairly radical theoretical\nchange. (They do not guarantee continuity in reference, and changes in\nreference can occur on some causal theories, e.g. Gareth Evans\u2019s\n(1973). Arguing that they do occur would require more, however, than\nmerely pointing to a change in theory.  Rather, it seems, cases of\nreference change must be identified and argued for on a case by case\nbasis.) Therefore, if taken to encompass terms for quantities and\nproperties (such as \u2018mass\u2019), the changes that Kuhn\nidentified as changes in meaning (e.g. those involved in the shift\nfrom Newtonian to relativistic physics) would not necessarily be\nchanges that bear on reference, nor, consequently, on comparison for\nnearness to the truth.  The simple causal theory of reference does\nhave its problems, such as explaining the referential mechanism of\nempty theoretical terms (e.g.caloric and phlogiston) (c.f. En\u00e7\n1976, Nola 1980). Causal-descriptive theories (which allow for a\ndescriptive component) tackle such problems while retaining the key\nidea that referential continuity is possible despite radical theory\nchange (Kroon 1985, Sankey 1994).\nOf course, the referentialist response shows only that reference\ncan be retained, not that it must be.  Consequently it is only a\npartial defence of realism against semantic incommensurability.  A\nfurther component of the defence of realism against incommensurability\nmust be an epistemic one.  For referentialism shows that a term can\nretain reference and hence that the relevant theories may be such that\nthe later constitutes a better approximation to the truth than the\nearlier.  Nonetheless it may not be possible for philosophers or\nothers to know that there has been such progress. Methodological\nincommensurability in particular seems to threaten the possibility of\nthis knowledge.  Kuhn thinks that in order to be in a position to\ncompare theories from older and more recent periods of normal science\none needs a perspective external to each and indeed any era of\nscience\u2013what he calls an \u2018Archimedean platform\u2019\n(1992, 14).  However, we never are able to escape from our current\nperspective. A realist response to this kind of incommensurability may\nappeal to externalist or naturalized epistemology.  These (related)\napproaches reject the idea that for a method to yield knowledge it\nmust be independent of any particular theory, perspective, or\nhistorical/cognitive circumstance.  So long as the method has an\nappropriate kind of reliability it can generate knowledge.  Contrary\nto the internalist view characteristic of the positivists (and, it\nappears, shared by Kuhn) the reliability of a method does not need to\nbe one that must be evaluable independently of any particular\nscientific perspective. It is not the case, for example, that the\nreliability of a method used in science must be justifiable by a\npriori means.  Thus the methods developed in one era may indeed\ngenerate knowledge, including knowledge that some previous era got\ncertain matters wrong, or right but only to a certain degree. A\nnaturalized epistemology may add that science itself is in the\nbusiness of investigating and developing methods.  As science develops\nwe would expect its methods to change and develop also.\n",
