    "main_text": "The Tractatus\n3. The Tractatus\n\nThe Tractatus can be divided into two main parts. One part\ndeals with doctrines found in the so-called logica\nantiquorum\u2014i.e., the logica vetus (old logic) and\nlogica nova (new logic)\u2014and the other contains\ndoctrines covered by the logica modernorum\u2014viz. the\ntracts that discuss the proprietates terminorum (properties\nof terms).\n\nThe first main part of the Tractatus divides into five\ntracts. The first tract, De introductionibus (On introductory\ntopics), explains the concepts used in traditional\nlogic\u2014nomen (noun), verbum (verb),\noratio (phrase), propositio (proposition)\u2014and\npresents the divisions of and the (logical) relationships between\npropositions. The second tract, De predicabilibus (On the\npredicables), covers matters dealt with in Boethius\u2019s accounts\nof Porphyry\u2019s Isagoge. It gives an account of the\nconcept predicabile and the five\npredicables\u2014genus, species,\ndifferentia, proprium, accidens\u2014i.e.,\nthe common features of and differences between the predicables, as\nwell as of the terms \u2018predicatio\u2019 and\n\u2018denominativum\u2019. Tract three, De\npredicamentis (On the categories), discusses the ten Aristotelian\ncategories, as well as some items already dealt with in the previous\ntreatise. The fourth tract, De sillogismis (On syllogisms),\nmainly goes back to Boethius\u2019s De syllogismis\ncategoricis (On categorical syllogisms). It gives an explanation\nof the basic element of the syllogism, i.e., propositio, and\nof the syllogism, and then goes into mood and figure, the proper forms\nof syllogisms, and briefly deals with what are called paralogisms. The\nfifth tract, De locis (On topical relationships), is derived\nfrom Boethius\u2019s De topicis differentiis (On different\ntopical relationships) I and II. This tract starts off with an\nexplanation of the notions argumentum and\nargumentatio, and then proceeds to deal with the species of\nargumentation: syllogism, induction, enthymeme, and example. Next, it\ngives a definition of locus (the Latin translation of the\nGreek topos): a locus is the seat of an argument\n(i.e., the locus is supposed to warrant the inference by\nbringing it under some generic rule.) The intrinsic loci (=\nthe kinds of locus that occurs when the argument is derived\nfrom the substance of the thing involved) are covered first, followed\nby the extrinsic loci (= the kinds of locus that\noccur when the argument is derived from something that is completely\nseparate from the substance of the thing involved) and intermediary\nloci (= the kinds of locus that occur when the\nargument is taken from the things that partly share in the terms of\nthe problem and partly differ from it). Examples are:\nintrinsic\u2014the locus \u201cfrom definition\u201d:\n\u2018a rational animal is running; therefore a man is\nrunning\u2019; extrinsic\u2014the locus \u201cfrom\nopposites\u201d: \u2018Socrates is black; therefore he is not\nwhite\u2019; intermediary\u2014\u2018the just is good; therefore\njustice is good\u2019.\n\nThe second part of the Tractatus comprises subjects that were\nof major importance in the doctrine of the properties of terms. In the\nsixth tract, De suppositionibus, the theory of supposition is\ndealt with. The treatise begins with an exposition of\nsignificatio. The definition of significatio runs:\nsignificatio is the respresentation of a thing by means of a\nword in accordance with convention. Next it gives a definition of the\nrelated terms suppositio and copulatio, and the\ndifferences between the terms significatio,\nsuppositio and copulatio. Of these three\nsuppositio and significatio are the most important\nin Peter\u2019s semantics. Suppositio is defined as the\nacceptance of a substantive verb for some thing. Suppositio\nis dependent on significatio, because supposition can only\noccur via a term that already has some significatio. Put in\nother words, significatio pertains to a word by itself, and\nsupposition to a term as actually used in some context.\n\nThe tract concludes with a division of suppositio. The first\ndivision is into suppositio communis (common supposition) and\nsuppositio discreta (discrete supposition)\u2014e.g., the\nterms homo (man) and Sortes (Socrates)\nrespectively.\n\nThe second division, suppositio communis, is divided into\nnaturalis (natural) and accidentalis (coincidental).\nSuppositio naturalis is described as the acceptance of a\ncommon term for all those things that can share in the common\nuniversal nature signified by the term in question\u2014e.g.,\nhomo (\u2018man\u2019) taken by itself by its very nature\nis able to stand for all men, whether in the past, present or future;\nsuppositio accidentalis is the acceptance of a common term\nfor those things for which the term in question requires an additional\nterm\u2014e.g., in homo est (\u2018A man is\u2019) the\nterm homo stands for present men, whereas in homo\nfuit (\u2018A man has been\u2019) and in homo erit\n(\u2018A man will be\u2019) it stands for past men and future men\nrespectively, owing to the additional terms fuit and\nerit.\n\nThe third division, suppositio accidentalis, is divided into\nsuppositio simplex (simple supposition) and suppositio\npersonalis (personal supposition). Suppositio simplex is\nthe acceptance of a term for the universal \u2018thing\u2019 it\nsignifies, as in homo est species (\u2018Man is a\nspecies\u2019, animal est genus (\u2018Animal is a\ngenus\u2019), in which the substantive terms homo and\nanimal stand for the universal man and animal, and not for\nany one of their particulars. Suppositio simplex can occur\nboth in the subject- and in the predicate-term\u2014e.g., homo\nest species (\u2018Man is a species\u2019) and omnis homo\nest animal (\u2018Every man is an animal\u2019) respectively.\nSuppositio personalis is the acceptance of a common term for\none or more of its particulars, as in homo currit (\u2018A\nman is running\u2019).\n\nThe fourth division, suppositio personalis, is subdivided\ninto either derterminata (determinate = standing for a\ncertain particular) or confusa (confused = standing for any\nindividual falling under that name). Suppositio determinata\noccurs when a common term is taken indefinitely or in combination with\na particular sign\u2014e.g., homo currit (\u2018Man is\nrunning\u2019) or aliquis homo currit (\u2018A/some man is\nrunning\u2019). Suppositio confusa occurs when a common term\nis taken in combination with a universal sign (\u2019Every man is\nrunning\u2019).\n\nThe tract on supposition winds up with the discussion of a few\nquestions regarding the attribution of supposition in a few cases.\n\nThe seventh tract of the Tractatus, on fallacies, which forms\npart of the Aristotelian-Boethian logic, is written in the tradition\nof the Fallacie maiores (Major fallacies). The eighth tract,\nDe relativis (On relatives), deals with the relative pronouns\nas defined by Priscian in his Institutiones grammaticae. The\nrelative pronouns are devided into: relatives of substance, such as\nqui (who), ille (he), alius (another), and\nrelatives of accident, such as talis (of such a kind),\nqualis (of what kind), tantus (so much),\nquantus (how much). The former are subdivided into relatives\nof identity (qui and ille) and relatives of\ndiversity (such as alter and reliquus, both of which\ncan be translated as \u2018the other\u2019). The relative of\nidentity is defined in terms of supposition as what refers to and\nstands for the same thing. These relatives are either reciprocal or\nnon-reciprocal. With regard to the relatives of identity, Peter adds a\ndicussion of a number of questions about the rationale for using\ndemonstrative pronouns, and some problems concerning how the fallacy\nof a relative having two diverse referents comes about.\n\nThe tract on relatives continues with a brief discussion on the\nrelatives of diversity, accompanied by a rule about the supposition of\nthe relative when it is added to a superior and an inferior in a\npremiss and a conclusion, as in aliud ab animali; ergo\naliud ab homine (\u2018Something other than an animal; therefore\nsomething other than a man\u2019). With regard to relatives of\nidentity a rule of the \u201cancients\u201d, who deny that a\nproposition introduced by a relative can have a contradictory\nopposite, is discussed and rejected. Another rule is given about the\nidentity of supposition of a non-reciprocal relative and what it\nrefers to. The tract concludes with short accounts of relatives of\naccident.\n\nThe ninth, tenth, eleventh, and twelfth tracts of the\nTractatus, i.e., the short tracts De ampliationibus\n(On ampliation), De appellationibus (On appellation), De\nrestrictionibus (On restriction) and De distributionibus\n(On distribution), are in fact elaborations of the theory of\nsupposition. Ampliation is an extension of the supposition of a term.\nIt occurs when an expression is combined with a modal term\u2014e.g.\nhomo potest esse Antichristus (\u2018A man can be the\nAntichrist\u2019), and homo necessario est animal (\u2018A\nman is necessarily an animal\u2019)\u2014in which case the\nsupposition of the term \u2018man\u2019 is extended to more than\njust individuals existing in the present. The tract on\nappellationes is very short: appellation is considered no\nmore than a special case of restriction, i.e., the restricted\nsupposition brought about by a present-tense verb. In this tract the\nrules of appellation are in fact specific kinds of rules of\nrestriction. The subject of restriction in general is discussed in the\neleventh tract. The rules of restriction are the same ones as were\npresented in the early Parisian textbooks on logic (see de Libera\n1982, pp. 176\u2013177). The final tract, on distribution, deals with\nthe multiplication of common terms as a result of their being combined\nwith universal signs. These universal signs are either distributive of\nsubstance (such as omnis, nullus), or of accidents\n(such as qualiscumque, quantuscumque). In this\ndescription \u2018substance\u2019 is defined as substistent modes of\nbeing, and \u2018accident\u2019 as accidental modes of being.\nSeparate attention is given to the universal sign omnis\n(\u2018all\u2019 or \u2018every\u2019) along with a discussion of\nthe common rule that the use of omnis requires three\nappellata (particular things). The most frequently cited\nexample in these discussions in the thirteenth century was the\nsophisma omnis phenix est (\u2018Every phoenix is\u2019).\nAccording to Peter of Spain, the use of omnis does not call\nfor at least three appellata; an exception to this rule is\nfound in cases in which there is only one appellatum, as is\nthe phoenix-case. The tract also pays attention to a number of\ntongue-twisting sophisma-sentences.\n",
