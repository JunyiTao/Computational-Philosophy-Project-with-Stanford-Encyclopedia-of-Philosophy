    "main_text": "Infinity in mathematics: a brief historical overview || The theory of indivisibles and points at infinity\n2.2 The theory of indivisibles and points at infinity\n\nEarly modern mathematicians were impressed by the Euclidean and\nArchimedean rigor, but there was widespread suspicion (confirmed in\n1906) that Archimedes must have had a less rigorous heuristic method\nthat he used to discover his surprising results.\n\nIn the 17th century, infinitary considerations in geometry opened the\nway to new geometrical techniques in quadratures and\ncubatures\u2014i.e. the determination of areas of plane\nfigures and of volumes of solid figures, respectively. We owe to\nCavalieri and Torricelli a geometrical theory of indivisibles that was\nlater put in an arithmetico-algebraic setting by Wallis (1656).\nCavalieri\u2019s original idea (1635) was that the relation between\nthe areas of two plane figures could be obtained by a systematic\ncomparison of what he called the indivisibles of the figures.\nAn indivisible of a figure is a geometrical entity of lower dimension\nthan the figure itself. An indivisible of a line is a point; an\nindivisible of a plane figure is a line segment; an indivisible of a\nsolid is a plane figure. Consider a square with top side AB and bottom\nside CD. An indivisible of the square is any arbitrary segment with\nthe same length as AB that can be obtained by letting AB move parallel\nto itself until it reaches CD. See the\n\nSupplement on Quadratures of the Circle by Exhaustion and by Indivisibles\n\n\nfor an explanation of how to give the quadrature of the circle with\nthe indivisibilist method, and how this courts infinite\ncollections.\n\nCavalieri\u2019s applications of the theory of indivisibles were\nlimited to finite figures and thus did not go beyond the geometrical\nboundaries typical of Greek mathematics. However, Torricelli broke new\nground with the determination of the volume of an infinitely long\n(infinite longum) solid (Torricelli 1644). Up to then, all\nthe results concerning finite figures obtained through indivisibles\ncould easily be proved by finitary Archimedean techniques and by\navoiding any mention of infinity\u2014just as in the case of the\nquadrature of the circle presented in the\n\nSupplement on Quadratures of the Circle by Exhaustion and by Indivisibles.\n\nHowever, infinity figured explicitly in Torricelli\u2019s result that\nan infinitely long solid (FEOBMDC in the diagram) had a finite volume\n(the volume of the cylinder ACIH in the diagram).\n\n\n\n\nThis was the first infinitary result in Western mathematics, for the\ninfinite was not eliminable using some alternative finitary technique\nbut rather showed up as a feature of the very object that had to be\nmeasured. Torricelli\u2019s infinitary result put enormous pressure\non empiricist conceptions of infinity. The heuristic fruitfulness of\nthe indivisibilist method was also accompanied by paradoxes that\nthreatened its foundations. Among them was Tacquet\u2019s proof using\nindivisibles that all triangles have the same area. The\nindivisibilists were able to deal with such paradoxes in various ways,\nbut the foundations of the system remained shaky (for a detailed\ndiscussion of the foundations of the theory of indivisibles and the\nmathematical and philosophical issues connected to Torricelli\u2019s\nresult see Mancosu (1996) and Jullien (2015)).\n\nAnother area in which the infinite made its appearance in 17th century\ngeometry is in the work of Desargues (see Sakarovitch and Dhombres\n1994 and Desargues 1636). Whereas in Euclidean geometry parallel lines\ndo not meet, Desargues entertained the idea of having\nparallel lines meet at a point at infinity. This was a very fruitful\nidea that led to the development of projective geometry.\n",
