    "main_text": "\n\nScience is an enormously successful human enterprise. The study of\nscientific method is the attempt to discern the activities by which\nthat success is achieved. Among the activities often identified as\ncharacteristic of science are systematic observation and\nexperimentation, inductive and deductive reasoning, and the formation\nand testing of hypotheses and theories. How these are carried out in\ndetail can vary greatly, but characteristics like these have been\nlooked to as a way of demarcating scientific activity from\nnon-science, where only enterprises which employ some canonical form\nof scientific method or methods should be considered science (see also\nthe entry on\n science and pseudo-science).\n Others have questioned whether there is anything like a fixed toolkit\nof methods which is common across science and only science. Some\nreject privileging one view of method as part of rejecting broader\nviews about the nature of science, such as naturalism (Dupr\u00e9\n2004); some reject any restriction in principle (pluralism).\n\nScientific method should be distinguished from the aims and products\nof science, such as knowledge, predictions, or control. Methods are\nthe means by which those goals are achieved. Scientific method should\nalso be distinguished from meta-methodology, which includes the values\nand justifications behind a particular characterization of scientific\nmethod (i.e., a methodology) \u2014 values such as objectivity,\nreproducibility, simplicity, or past successes. Methodological rules\nare proposed to govern method and it is a meta-methodological question\nwhether methods obeying those rules satisfy given values. Finally,\nmethod is distinct, to some degree, from the detailed and contextual\npractices through which methods are implemented. The latter might\nrange over: specific laboratory techniques; mathematical formalisms or\nother specialized languages used in descriptions and reasoning;\ntechnological or other material means; ways of communicating and\nsharing results, whether with other scientists or with the public at\nlarge; or the conventions, habits, enforced customs, and institutional\ncontrols over how and what science is carried out.\n\nWhile it is important to recognize these distinctions, their\nboundaries are fuzzy. Hence, accounts of method cannot be entirely\ndivorced from their methodological and meta-methodological motivations\nor justifications, Moreover, each aspect plays a crucial role in\nidentifying methods. Disputes about method have therefore played out\nat the detail, rule, and meta-rule levels. Changes in beliefs about\nthe certainty or fallibility of scientific knowledge, for instance\n(which is a meta-methodological consideration of what we can hope for\nmethods to deliver), have meant different emphases on deductive and\ninductive reasoning, or on the relative importance attached to\nreasoning over observation (i.e., differences over particular\nmethods.) Beliefs about the role of science in society will affect the\nplace one gives to values in scientific method.\n\nThe issue which has shaped debates over scientific method the most in\nthe last half century is the question of how pluralist do we need to\nbe about method? Unificationists continue to hold out for one method\nessential to science; nihilism is a form of radical pluralism, which\nconsiders the effectiveness of any methodological prescription to be\nso context sensitive as to render it not explanatory on its own. Some\nmiddle degree of pluralism regarding the methods embodied in\nscientific practice seems appropriate. But the details of scientific\npractice vary with time and place, from institution to institution,\nacross scientists and their subjects of investigation. How significant\nare the variations for understanding science and its success? How much\ncan method be abstracted from practice? This entry describes some of\nthe attempts to characterize scientific method or methods, as well as\narguments for a more context-sensitive approach to methods embedded in\nactual scientific practices.\n",
