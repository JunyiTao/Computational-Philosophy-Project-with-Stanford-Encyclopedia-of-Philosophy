    "main_text": "Five Widely Accepted Assumptions (And a Sixth, More Controversial One) || Decision Relativity\n5.2 Decision Relativity\n\nDecision relativity refers to the now almost universally accepted idea\nthat an individual\u2019s decisional capacity should be assessed\nrelative to a specific decision, at a particular time, in a particular\ncontext (Buchanan & Brock 1989: 18\u201320; Culver & Gert\n1990: 620; Zapf & Roesch 2005). The requirement issues from the\nvalue placed on freedom to choose, along with the recognition of\nseveral facts. First, not all decisions require the same level of\nmental ability. Understanding all the facts relevant to making\ndecision A might be much easier than understanding all the\nfacts relevant to making decision B. The idea is to allow\npeople to make the most use they can of the mental abilities they\nhave.\n\nIt is also important to note that decisional capacity can vary within\na single individual over time and in relation to what else is going\non. For example, medications can make people drowsy or confused, but\nbetween doses when the medication wears off individuals may be\nperfectly capable of making decisions. Similarly, someone with\nmoderate dementia may become more disoriented in unfamiliar\nsurroundings or in the presence of someone she does not know, and so\nbe less able to focus on a decision. Commitment to maximizing a\nperson\u2019s chance of deciding for herself means that we ought to\nbe sensitive to such factors and should try to assess capacity under\nthe most favorable conditions (Appelbaum 2007).\n\nThis emphasis on decision-relativity differs markedly from ideas\naccepted in an earlier era when decisional capacity was thought to\nextend globally over time and place, irrespective of context. Indeed,\nthis more global notion continues to be employed in some areas of law.\nOne illustration of the now widespread acceptance of decision\nrelativity in medicine is that certain tests once thought to be\nperfectly acceptable tests of decisional capacity are no longer deemed\nto be so. A case in point is the mini-mental state examination\n(Folstein, Folstein, & McHugh 1975). This is a simple psychometric\ntool that was developed to help clinicians assess how disoriented (or\nnot) their patients are, by ranking patient responses to familiar\nquestions such as, \u201cWhere are you right now?\u201d Some\nquestions also address basic perceptual and mental skills (Can you\ncount back from 100 subtracting 7 at a time?). Although extremely\npopular and still used as a rough assessment of orientation, it is now\nthought to be too global and general to serve as assessment of a\npatient\u2019s mental capacity to make treatment decisions. By law,\nassessment must now be more \u201ccase-specific\u201d and responsive\nto \u201csituational variations in demands\u201d (Grisso &\nAppelbaum 1998: 22).\n",
