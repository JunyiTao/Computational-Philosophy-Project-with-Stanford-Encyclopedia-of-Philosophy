The Continuing Influence of Pascal\u2019s Wager\n\nPascal\u2019s Wager vies with Anselm\u2019s Ontological Argument for\nbeing the most famous argument in the philosophy of religion. Indeed,\nthe Wager arguably has greater influence nowadays than any other such\nargument\u2014not just in the service of Christian apologetics, but\nalso in its impact on various lines of thought associated with\ninfinity, decision theory, probability, epistemology, psychology, and\neven moral philosophy. It has provided a case study for attempts to\ndevelop infinite decision theories. In it, Pascal countenanced the\nnotion of infinitesimal probability long before philosophers such as\nLewis 1980 and Skyrms 1980 gave it prominence. It continues to put\ninto sharp relief the question of whether there can be pragmatic\nreasons for belief, and the putative difference between theoretical\nand practical rationality. It raises subtle issues about the extent to\nwhich one\u2019s beliefs can be a matter of the will, and the ethics\nof belief.\n\nReasoning reminiscent of Pascal\u2019s Wager, often with an explicit\nacknowledgment of it, also informs a number of debates in moral\nphilosophy, both theoretical and applied. Kenny 1985 suggests that\nnuclear Armageddon has negative infinite utility, and some might say\nthe same for the loss of even a single human life. Stich 1978\ncriticizes an argument that he attributes to Mazzocchi, that there\nshould be a total ban on recombinant DNA research, since such research\ncould lead to the \u201cAndromeda scenario\u201d of creating a\nkiller strain of bacterial culture against which humans are helpless;\nthe ban, moreover, should be enforced if the \u201cAndromeda scenario\nhas even the smallest possibility of occurring\u201d (191), in\nMazzocchi\u2019s words. This is plausibly read, then, as an\nassignment of negative infinite utility to the Andromeda scenario.\nMore recently, Colyvan, Cox, and Steele 2010 discuss Pascal\u2019s\nWager-like problems for certain deontological moral theories, in which\nviolations of duties are assigned negative infinite utility. Colyvan,\nJustus and Regan 2011 canvas difficulties associated with assigning\ninfinite value to the natural environment. Bartha and DesRoches 2017\nrespond, with an appeal to relative utility theory. Stone 2007 argues\nthat a version of Pascal\u2019s Wager applies to sustaining patients\nwho are in a persistent vegetative state; see Varelius 2013 for a\ndissenting view. Pascal\u2019s Wager has even been appealed to in the\nmedical debate over whether antibiotics should be used to prevent a\ncertain kind of inflammation in the heart (Shaw and Conway 2010).\n\nPascal\u2019s Wager is a watershed in the philosophy of religion. As\nwe have seen, it is also a great deal more besides.\n",
