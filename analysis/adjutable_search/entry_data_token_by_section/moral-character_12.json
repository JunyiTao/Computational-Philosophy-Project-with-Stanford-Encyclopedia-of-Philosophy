    "main_text": "Virtue and moral character after the Greeks || Rawls\n3.6 Rawls\n\nAs indicated in the introduction to this entry, a renewed\nphilosophical interest in questions of virtue and character was\nindirectly the result of the publication in 1971 of John Rawls\u2019s\nA Theory of Justice. In contrast to many of his\ncontemporaries who focused on meta-ethical questions and the meaning\nof moral terms, Rawls (1921\u20132002) moved moral and political\nphilosophy in a practical direction and stimulated modern philosophers\nto explore the psychological grounding of good moral character. Early\nin Part II of A Theory of Justice, Rawls makes what he calls\na \u201cperfectly obvious\u201d point \u2013 that the social system\nshapes the wants and aspirations that its citizens come to have. It\ndetermines \u201cin part the sort of persons they want to be as well\nas the sort of persons they are\u201d (1999a, 229). These points,\nRawls claims, have always been recognized. \n\nHow do just institutions shape our wants and aims and affect the sort\nof people we become? The institutions of interest to Rawls are those\nthat make up a society\u2019s \u201cbasic structure\u201d. These\nare the institutions that make social cooperation possible and\nproductive. They include the political constitution, the structure of\nthe economy, legalized forms of property ownership, the family in some\nform, and others. Rawls defends two principles of justice as\nregulations for the basic structure of his just society: (1) the equal\nliberties principle, according to which each person has the same claim\nto a fully adequate scheme of basic liberties. (2) and a second\nprinciple that specifies two conditions that must be satisfied in\norder for socio-economic inequalities to be permissible. These\nconditions are fair equality of opportunity and the difference\nprinciple.\n\nConsider Rawls\u2019s discussion of the guarantee of equal liberties\nunder the first principle of justice. This principle covers two types\nof liberties, personal liberties and political liberties. Under this\nprinciple, each person is entitled to liberties of both kinds as a\nbasic right. But Rawls goes further to argue that political liberties\nmust be assured their \u201cfair value\u201d (1999a, 243). This\nmeans that chances to hold office and to exercise political influence\nmust be independent of socio-economic position. Otherwise,\n\u201cpolitical power rapidly accumulates and becomes unequal\u201d\n(1999a, 199). To preserve fair value, Rawls does not follow\nAristotle\u2019s strategy of making political participation a\nrequirement of all citizens. Yet he shares with Aristotle the view\nthat the guarantee of fair value has the aim of promoting and\nsustaining citizens\u2019 common status as equal citizens (1999a,\n205\u2013206). Moreover, Rawls agrees with Mill that political\nparticipation contributes to the moral development of citizens. As\nnoted in Section 3.4 above, when praising Athenian democracy, Mill\nwrites that when a citizen participates in public deliberation,\n\u201che is called upon \u2026 to weigh interests not his own, to\nbe guided, in case of conflicting claims by another rule than his\nprivate partialities; to apply at every turn principles and maxims\nwhich have for their reason of existence the general good \u2026 .\nHe is made to feel himself one of the public, and whatever is their\ninterest to be his interest\u201d (1991, 79). The guarantee of\npolitical liberty both strengthens citizens\u2019 sense of their own\nvalue and enlarges their moral sensibilities.\n\nIn part III, Rawls turns to the question of how individuals acquire a\ndesire to act justly, and to do so for the right reasons, when they\nhave lived under and benefited from just institutions (1999a, 399).\nRawls\u2019s account is indebted to Aristotle\u2019s views in\nseveral ways. First, Rawls holds, as Aristotle did, that if proper\ninstitutions are in place, then the attitudes and behaviors associated\nwith the desire to act justly will emerge naturally, as a result of\npsychological tendencies persons experience in ordinary life. For,\nother things being equal, it is part of human psychology to enjoy most\nthe exercise of one\u2019s realized powers (see Rawls\u2019s\ndiscussion of what he calls the Aristotelian Principle), to enjoy the\nrealization of others\u2019 powers (see his discussion of the\n\u201ccompanion effect\u201d to the Aristotelian principle), and to\nform ties of attachment and friendship to persons and institutions who\npromote one\u2019s good. Second, and again like Aristotle, Rawls\nargues that if citizens are fortunate to live in a community that\nprovides the basic goods they need for realizing their powers and that\noffers them opportunities to develop and use their abilities in shared\nactivities with others, then they will develop a stable sense of their\nown value that is based on their own accomplishments and their status\nas equal citizens, rather than on a position more advantaged relative\nto others. With a stable sense of their own value and a reasonable\nhope of achieving their aims, citizens will want to act justly for the\nright reasons. They will not be prone to rancor, jealousy, and hostile\nenvy, \u201cone of the vices of hating mankind\u201d (1999a,\n466).\n\nOnly a brief discussion of these points of coincidence is possible\nhere. Consider, first, sections 72\u201375 of A Theory of\nJustice, where Rawls outlines what he calls the three stages of\nmoral development, governed by three psychological laws. These laws\nexplain how individuals come to have new, non-derivative, final ends\nas they acquire ties of love, friendship, affection, and trust. As\nAristotle recognized, these ties are caused to occur in individuals as\nthey come to recognize others\u2019 evident intention to act for\ntheir good, and to enjoy what they and others can do.\n\nAt the first stage of moral development, on the assumption that family\ninstitutions are just, children come to love their parents as a result\nof their parents\u2019 demonstrating clearly that their children are\nenjoyed and valued. At the second stage, on the assumption that\ncooperative associations are fairly arranged and known to be so,\nmembers of reasonably successful cooperative associations\n(Rawls\u2019s \u201csocial unions\u201d) come to enjoy and value\ntheir cooperative partners. This happens when members do their parts\nresponsibly, each contributing to a mutually recognized goal, and\nwhere all participants display appropriate abilities. Under these\nconditions, participants come to enjoy their own participation, to\nenjoy the display of others\u2019 skills and abilities, and to form\nties of friendship and trust with their cooperative partners. Because\nthe activities are complementary, individuals can see themselves in\nwhat others do. In this way, individuals\u2019 sense of what they are\ndoing is worthwhile. Their self-love, to use Aristotelian language,\nbecomes a group achievement.\n\nFinally, at the third stage, as individuals come to realize how the\ninstitutions regulated by the principles of justice promote their good\nand the good of their fellow citizens, they become attached to these\nprinciples and develop a desire to apply and to act in accordance with\nthem. Like the major institutions of Aristotle\u2019s ideal\npolis, the institutions regulated by Rawls\u2019s two\nprinciples of justice have as their aim to promote citizens\u2019\ngood by providing the social bases of individuals\u2019 self-worth\n(Rawls\u2019s primary good of \u201cself-respect\u201d). The\nprovision of equal liberties in accordance with the first principle of\njustice enables citizens to form the associations in which their\ncommon aims and ideals can be pursued. As we have seen, these\nassociations are necessary for self-respect to be produced and\nmaintained. The guarantee of the fair value of political liberty,\nalong with fair equality of opportunity under Rawls\u2019s second\nprinciple of justice, prevent excessive accumulation of property and\nwealth and maintain equal opportunity of education for all, enabling\neveryone with similar motivation and ability to have roughly equal\nprospects of culture and achievement (1999a, 63). Taken together,\nthese two principles ensure that persons have reasonable hopes of\nachieving their aims. Finally, the difference principle serves to\nensure everyone a decent standard of living, no matter what individual\ncitizens\u2019 social position, natural talents, or fortune may be.\nThe difference principle, Rawls writes, corresponds to the \u201cidea\nof not wanting to have greater advantages unless this is to the\nbenefit of others who are less well off\u201d (1999a, 90). In these\nvarious ways, the two principles, in combination, amount to a publicly\nacknowledged recognition that each citizen has equal worth.\n\nOnce these just institutions are in place, Rawls thinks that the worst\naspects of the social division of labor can be overcome. No one, he\nwrites, \u201cneed be servilely dependent on others and made to\nchoose between monotonous and routine occupations which are deadening\nto human thought and sensibility\u201d (1999a, 464). Here Rawls notes\nthe same problems with many types of paid labor that so disturbed\nAristotle. Paid labor often limits the worker\u2019s exercise of her\ndecision-making powers and requires her to conform to the direction of\nothers. Of course, Rawls does not suggest solving these problems as\nAristotle did. But he thinks that they need to be solved, and that a\njust society can solve them, perhaps by adopting Mill\u2019s proposal\n(see Section 3.4 above) to restructure workplaces to become\nworker-managed cooperatives (2001, 178).\n\nFor further discussion of Rawls\u2019s views on how institutions\nshape our characters, see Freeman (2007, ch. 6) and Edmundson (2017,\nch. 3).\n4. Contemporary Questions About Character\n\nMarx, Mill, and Rawls suggest how character can be molded by\nantecedent circumstances \u2013 Marx by economic structures; Mill by\npaid work, political life, and family relationships; Rawls by the\ninstitutions regulated by the two principles of justice. Yet these\ninsights about the effect of institutions on character seem to raise\nother, more troubling questions: if our character is the result of\nsocial and political institutions beyond our control, then perhaps we\nare not in control of our characters at all and becoming decent is not\na real possibility. \n\nAmong contemporary philosophers, Susan Wolf is one of several who\naddress these worries. In her Freedom Within Reason Wolf\nargues that almost any morally problematic upbringing could be\ncoercive and could render a person unable to see what he ought morally\nto do or render him unable to act on that recognition. As examples,\nWolf cites ordinary citizens of Nazi Germany, white children of slave\nowners in the 1850s, and persons brought up to embrace conventional\nsex roles. Wolf thinks that there is no method for determining which\nupbringings and influences are consistent with an ability to see what\nshould be done and to act accordingly, and hence she thinks there is\nalways the risk that we are less responsible for our actions than we\nmay hope. \n\nSuch skepticism may be misplaced. For if good character is based on\nnaturally occurring psychological responses that most people\n(including persons brought up to embrace racist and sexist beliefs)\nexperience without difficulty, then most people should be able to\nbecome better and to be responsible for actions that express (or could\nexpress) their character. \n\nStill, this is not to say that changing one\u2019s character is easy,\nstraightforward, or quickly achieved. If character is formed or\nmalformed by the structures of political, economic, and family life,\nthen changing one\u2019s character may require access to the\nappropriate transforming forces, which may not be available. In modern\nsocieties, for example, many adults still work at alienating jobs that\ndo not afford opportunity to realize the human powers and to\nexperience the pleasures of self-expression. Women in particular,\nbecause of unequal domestic arrangements, nearly total responsibility\nfor childcare, and sex segregation in the workplace, often endure\nlow-paying, dead-end jobs that encourage feelings of self-hatred. In a\nfamily where economic, and hence psychological, power is unequal\nbetween women and men, affection, as Mill recognized, may harm both\nparties. Thus many women and men today may not be well-positioned to\ndevelop fully the psychological capacities Aristotle, Marx, Mill, and\nRawls considered foundational to virtuous character.\n\nThese considerations indicate why character has become a central issue\nnot only in ethics, but also in feminist philosophy, political\nphilosophy, philosophy of education, and philosophy of literature. If\ndeveloping good moral character requires being members of a community\nin which citizens can fully realize their human powers and ties of\nfriendship, then one needs to ask how educational, economic,\npolitical, and social institutions should be structured to make that\ndevelopment possible. Some contemporary philosophers are now\naddressing these issues. For example, Martha Nussbaum uses\nAristotelian virtues to outline a democratic ideal in (1990b). In\n(1996) Andrew Mason explores how capitalist market forces make it\ndifficult for virtues to flourish. In (1987) Jon Elster interprets\nMarx as offering a conception of the good life that consists in active\nself-realization, which can be promoted or blocked by economic and\npolitical institutions. In (1993) John Bernard Murphy reconstructs\nAristotle\u2019s views on practical deliberation and decision-making\nto show how they can yield a theory of productive labor that helps us\nsee what is wrong with work in the contemporary world and how to\nre-organize it. Rosalind Hursthouse applies an Aristotelian view of\nthe emotions to an investigation of racist attitudes in (2001). In\n(2010) Marcia Homiak develops Aristotle\u2019s and Mill\u2019s views\non the transformative power of institutions to explore the\npossibilities for living virtuously in an imperfect world. Laurence\nThomas (1989) uses Aristotle\u2019s discussions of self-love and\nfriendship to argue that friendship helps to develop and maintain good\nmoral character. And if one is interested in understanding what the\nnature of moral character is and the extent to which it can be\naltered, one will find useful examples of both good and bad moral\ncharacter in literary writers. For philosophical discussion of\nliterary writers\u2019 use of character, see Taylor (1996) and\nNussbaum (1990a).\n\nFinally, it might be useful to note that this brief discussion of the\nhistory of philosophical views of character indicates that character\nhas played, or can play, an important role in a variety of western\nethical traditions, from Greek virtue-centered views to Kantianism to\nutilitarianism to Marxism. So Anscombe\u2019s provocative claim with\nwhich this entry began \u2013 that the two major traditions in modern\nmoral theory (Kantianism and utilitarianism) have ignored questions of\nvirtue and character to their detriment \u2013 does not seem\naltogether true. Nevertheless, some of the views surveyed here seem to\ngive a more prominent role to character and virtue than do others. It\nis not easy to explain precisely what this prominence consists in.\nAlthough a full treatment of these issues is beyond the scope of this\nessay, a preliminary indication of how they might be addressed can be\nprovided. For further discussion of these questions, see Trianosky\n(1990), Watson (1990), Homiak (1997), and Hursthouse (2001).\n\nAs this entry has indicated, Kant\u2019s views do provide a role for\nvirtue, for it matters to Kant that we perform our imperfect duties\nwith the right spirit. The virtuous person has the properly cultivated\ntendencies to feel that make it easier for her to perform her\nimperfect duties. These feelings support her recognition of what is\nright and are a sign that she is disposed to perform her duties.\nBecause Kant views the emotions as recalcitrant and in continual need\nof reason\u2019s control, virtue amounts to a kind of self-mastery or\ncontinence. One might put this point by saying that, for Kant,\nvirtuous character is subordinate to the claims of practical\nreason.\n\nAristotle\u2019s view, on the other hand, is usually considered a\nparadigm example of a \u201cvirtue ethics\u201d, an ethical theory\nthat gives priority to virtuous character. To see what this might\nmean, recall that Aristotle\u2019s virtuous person is a genuine\nself-lover who enjoys most the exercise of her abilities to think and\nknow. This enjoyment guides her practical determinations of what\nactions are appropriate in what circumstances and renders her\nunattracted to the pleasures associated with the common vices. Her\nproperly cultivated emotional tendencies are not viewed as\nrecalcitrant aspects of her being that need to be controlled by\nreason. Rather, her practical decisions are informed and guided by the\nenjoyment she takes in her rational powers. One might put this point\nby saying that, in Aristotle\u2019s view, practical deliberation is\nsubordinate to character.\n\nOne might then ask of other ethical views whether they take practical\ndeliberation to be subordinate to character or vice versa. As this\nentry has indicated, Hume appears to side with Aristotle and to give\ncharacter priority over practical deliberation. For he suggests that\nsomeone with the natural virtues based on self-esteem will have the\nwider imaginative powers needed for correct deliberation from the\nstandpoint of the judicious spectator. Whether character is\nsubordinate to reason for Mill may depend on what sort of\nutilitarianism Mill can be shown to espouse. If he is a\nmotive-utilitarian who thinks that one should act as the person with\nthe motives or virtues most productive of happiness would act, then a\ncase could be made for his giving character priority over practical\nreason. If, on the other hand, he is an act- or rule-utilitarian, he\nwould seem to give character a role that is subordinate to reason.\nThese brief remarks indicate that the question of whether an ethical\ntheorist gives priority to character can only be determined by a\nthorough analysis of the various critical elements of that\nphilosopher\u2019s view.\n5. Moral Character and Empirical Studies\n5.1 The challenge posed by situationism\n\nThis section will begin with a brief discussion of some recent\nphilosophical work on character that relies on results in experimental\nsocial psychology. This philosophical work calls into question the\nconceptions of character and virtue that are of concern especially to\nthe ancient Greek moralists and to contemporary philosophers whose\nwork derives from ancient views. Philosophers impressed by this\ntradition in experimental social psychology \u2013 which is often\nlabeled \u201csituationism\u201d\u2013 have denied that traits of\ncharacter are stable, consistent, or evaluatively integrated in the\nway that ancient or contemporary philosophers suggest. The ancient\nmoralists assumed that virtues are, in John Doris\u2019s description,\n\u201crobust traits: if a person has a robust trait, they\ncan be confidently expected to display trait-relevant behavior across\na wide variety of trait-relevant situations, even where some or all of\nthese situations are not optimally conducive to such behavior\u201d\n(2002, 18). Doris and others argue that traits are not robust in this\nsense. They are not stable or consistent and are wrongly invoked to\nexplain why people act as they do. Rather, these philosophers argue,\nand as the experimental tradition indicates, much of human behavior is\nattributable to seemingly trivial features of the situations in which\npersons find themselves. Hence the appropriateness of the label\n\u201csituationist\u201d for the philosophers espousing these views.\nFor variations on this view, see Harman (1999, 2000), Doris (2002),\nand Vranas (2005). \n\nIt is beyond the scope of this entry to discuss this work in detail.\nSome summary remarks, however, are in order. (For a detailed\ndiscussion, see the entries on\n empirical approaches to moral character,\n section 1, and\n moral psychology: empirical approaches,\n section 4.)\n\nSkepticism about robust traits of character emerges from some famous\nexperiments in social psychology. For example, in one experiment\npersons who found a dime in a phone booth were far more likely to help\na confederate who dropped some papers than were those who did not find\na dime. Another experiment involved seminary students who agreed to\ngive a talk on the importance of helping those in need. On the way to\nthe building where their talks were to be given, they encountered a\nconfederate slumped over and groaning. Those who were told they were\nalready late were much less likely to help than those who were told\nthey had time to spare. These experiments are taken to show that minor\nfactors without moral significance (finding a dime, being in a hurry)\nare strongly correlated with people\u2019s helping behavior.\n\nPerhaps most damning for the robust view of character are the results\nof the experiments conducted by Stanley Milgram in the 1960s. In these\nexperiments the great majority of subjects, when politely though\nfirmly requested by an experimenter, were willing to administer what\nthey thought were increasingly severe electric shocks to a screaming\n\u201cvictim.\u201d These experiments are taken to show that if\nsubjects did have compassionate tendencies, these tendencies cannot\nhave been of the type that robust traits require.\n\nPhilosophers influenced by the experimental tradition in social\npsychology conclude that people do not have the broadly based, stable,\nconsistent traits of character that were of interest to the ancient\nand modern moralists, or to contemporary philosophers working with\nsome version of those views. Rather, the psychological studies are\ntaken to show that persons generally have only narrow,\n\u201clocal\u201d traits that are not unified with other traits into\na wider behavioral pattern. Persons are helpful when in a good mood,\nsay, but not helpful when in a hurry, or they are honest at home but\nnot honest at work. This skepticism about robust traits thus poses a\nchallenge to contemporary philosophers, especially those who work with\nsome version of the ancient views, to develop an account of character\nthat is consistent with empirical results.\n5.2 Some replies to situationism\n\nThese interpretations of the experiments in social psychology have\nbeen challenged by both psychologists and philosophers, especially by\nphilosophers working in the tradition of virtue ethics (see related\nentry on\n virtue ethics),\n who claim that the character traits criticized by situationists have\nlittle to do with the conception of character associated with the\nancient and modern moralists. The objectors say that the situationists\nrely on an understanding of character traits as isolated and often\nnon-reflective dispositions to behave in stereotypical ways. They\nwrongly assume that traits can be determined from a single type of\nbehavior stereotypically associated with that trait.\n\nConsider again the payphone and seminarian studies. It may seem\nobvious that one cannot respond to all appeals for help, and it may\nseem doubtful that any reflective person thinks one should. This\nsuggests that being a helpful person requires some thinking about what\nis most important in one\u2019s life, for calls of help can\njustifiably go unanswered if the individual believes that responding\nwill interfere with her doing something else that she takes to be of\nhigher moral importance. So we should not expect helping behavior to\nbe wholly consistent, given the complex situations in which persons\nfind themselves. Some of the philosophers discussed in this entry,\nsuch as the natural law theorists (in section 3.1) and Kant (in\nsection 3.2), might make this point by reminding us of the distinction\nbetween perfect and imperfect duties. Unlike perfect duties, which\nrequire that we take or forego certain actions, the duty to assist\nothers in need is imperfect, in that how, when, and whom we assist is\nnot precisely specifiable and so is within the individual\u2019s\ndiscretion. The general point, on which most of the ancient and modern\nmoralists would agree, is that being helpful cannot be understood in\nisolation from other values, aims, and traits that the individual has.\n(For discussion of how values can be unified, see Wolf 2007.)\n\nOr consider the Milgram experiments. During the experiments, many of\nthe subjects protested even while continuing to obey the\nexperimenter\u2019s commands. In post-experiment interviews with\nsubjects, Milgram noted that many were completely convinced of the\nwrongness of what they were doing. But the presence of conflict need\nnot indicate an absence, or loss, of character. On a traditional\nconception of character, as examined in this entry, many of\nMilgram\u2019s subjects are best described as incontinent. They have\ncharacter, but it is neither virtuous nor vicious. Many of us seem to\nfall into this category. We often recognize what it is right to do but\nwe nevertheless do not do it.\n\nIn short, the objectors say that the situationists rely on a\nsimplified view of character. They assume that behavior is often\nsufficient to indicate the presence of a trait of character, and they\nignore the other psychological aspects of character (both cognitive\nand affective) that, for most of the philosophers discussed in this\nentry, form a more or less consistent and integrated set of beliefs\nand desires. In particular, the objectors say, the situationists\nignore the role of practical deliberation (or, in the case of virtuous\ncharacter, practical wisdom).\n\nFor variations on these replies to the situationists, see Kupperman\n(2001), Kamtekar (2004), Radcliffe (2007), Sabini and Silver (2005),\nSreenivasan (2013), and cf. von Wright (1963,136\u2013154).\n5.3 Some empirical approaches to Aristotelian views of character\n\nSome recent philosophical work on character aims to meet the\nskepticism of the situationist challenge directly, by developing a\ntheory of virtue grounded in psychological studies that are compatible\nwith the existence of robust traits. This section provides a brief\nsummary of two such approaches to virtue.\n\nFor extensive and nuanced discussion, see Miller (2013, 2014) and\nSection 2 of the entry on\n empirical approaches to moral character,\n section 2. \n\nOne approach is inspired by the \u201ccognitive-affective personality\nsystem\u201d (the so-called CAPS model) that has been developed by\nsocial and cognitive psychologists. Rather than looking for empirical\nevidence of robust traits in behavioral regularities across different\ntypes of situations, the CAPS model (and philosophers impressed by\nthis model) focus on the importance of how agents understand the\nsituations they are in. The model views the structure of personality\nas the organization of relationships among \u201ccognitive-affective\nunits\u201d. These units are clusters of dispositions to feel,\ndesire, believe, and plan that, once activated, cause various\nthoughts, feelings, and behavior to be formed. Philosophers who ground\ntheir understanding of virtue in this type of psychological theory\nextend the CAPS model to cover robust virtuous traits of character.\nThese traits are viewed as enduring dispositions that include the\nappropriate clusters of thinking (practical reason), desire, and\nfeeling, manifested in cross-situational behavior.\n\nFor detailed discussion of the CAPS model and its possible value to\nphilosophers, see Miller (2003, 2014), Russell (2009) and Snow\n(2010).\n\nOther philosophers do not find the extension of the CAPS model\nespecially helpful, for it does not seem to move us past what we\ncommonsenically recognize as virtue. We are prepared to begin with the\nidea that being virtuous is not just being disposed to act, but also\nto feel, respond, and to reason. And not simply to reason, but to\nreason well. For this approach to be helpful, we need some account of\nwhat excellent practical reasoning consists in.\n\nSome philosophers aim to provide what is needed by looking to\npsychological studies of enjoyment. They propose that virtues are\nanalogous to (some) skills, in that the kind of habituation involved\nin developing and acting from virtuous character is like the sort of\nintelligent habituation typical of the development and exercise of\n(some) complex skills. The empirical studies of enjoyment show that,\nother things being equal, we enjoy the exercise of developed\nabilities, and the more complex the ability, the more we enjoy its\nexercise. If the acquisition and exercise of virtue is analogous to\nthe development and exercise of complex ability, we can, this approach\nsuggests, explain a variety of central points about virtuous activity\n\u2013 for example, that, like (some) skills, virtuous activity is\nexperienced as being its own end, as being enjoyable in itself, and\nthus as valued for its own sake. For discussion of virtue as similar\nto complex skill, see Annas (2011), Bloomfield (2014), Stichter (2007,\n2011), and cf. Sherman (1989).\n\nSituationists might nevertheless reply that to emphasize the role of\nexpertise in practical reasoning is to make good moral character an\nideal that too few of us, if any, can achieve. On some conceptions of\nmoral knowledge, such as that proposed by Plato in the\nRepublic, acquiring the knowledge necessary for virtue takes\nover 50 years of psychological and intellectual training. And on\nAristotle\u2019s view, as this entry has indicated in Section 2.4\nabove, the full realization of our rational powers that is required\nfor good moral character is not something that we can achieve on our\nown. The development and preservation of good moral character requires\npolitical institutions that promote the conditions under which\nself-love and friendship flourish. The situationist might wonder how\nuseful traditional conceptions of good character can be, if acquiring\nvirtuous character is a long and difficult process made possible by\nsocial institutions that do not yet exist. The situationist may take\nthese problems as support for his view that we are better off thinking\nin terms of local traits rather than robust traits.\n\nIn ending, it is appropriate to recall the discussion in Section 4,\nabove. On the one hand, on a view of character such as\nAristotle\u2019s, which relies on ordinary capacities to experience\nthe pleasures of self-expression and to respond with friendly feelings\nto others\u2019 efforts to help, almost everyone is capable of\nbecoming better. On the other hand, if Aristotle and others\n(such as Marx, Mill, T. H. Green, and Rawls) are correct that\ncharacter is shaped by the institutions of political, economic, and\nfamily life, then becoming good will require access to the\nappropriate institutions. Yet this is not to suggest that becoming\ngood is out of our reach. It may be helpful here to recall\nRawls\u2019s description of a \u201crealistic utopia\u201d in\nThe Law of Peoples when, following Rousseau in The Social\nContract, he writes that just institutions take \u201cmen as\nthey are\u201d and \u201claws as they might be.\u201d (Rawls,\n1999b, 7) Our psychological natures and the institutions that promote\ngood qualities of character are, in his view and in the views of\nothers discussed throughout this entry, congruent.",
