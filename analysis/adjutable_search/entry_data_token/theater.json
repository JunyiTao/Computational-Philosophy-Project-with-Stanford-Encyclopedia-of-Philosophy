Whether what he meant was a kind of cognitive therapy or a form\nof psychological therapy is a question that has vexed scholars to this\nday; and it turns on how one understands two terms: katharsis\nand mimesis (Schaper 1968; Golden 1973; Diamond 1989; Lear\n1992; Woodruff 1992).  This dispute is interesting first because it\nreflects the fact that theater has been a topic of philosophical\ndispute, investigation, use, or illustration since near the beginning\nof Western philosophy in the ancient Greek world. Second, its terms\ncontinue to have influence over current disputes within theater\nstudies and performance theories (Puchner 2013). Finally, and\nprimarily, it links descriptive metaphysical issues, such as what\ntheater is by its nature, with normative issues, such as the value of\ntheatrical performances within a culture. Several recent philosophical\nworks emphasizing descriptive issues have attempted to understand just\nwhat is going on in theatrical performances and other performance arts\n(Saltz 1991a; Thom 1992; Osipovich 2006; Hamilton 2007; D. Davies\n2011). This entry will focus largely on topics that are similar to or\nare themselves the issues examined in these works.\n\nPhilosophy of theater, like much else in aesthetics and philosophy of\nart, is wide in its scope and makes contact with many other\ndisciplines within philosophy and outside of it. This entry should\nhelp make that clear. The first section of this entry will provide\nbackground information and describe an important normative issue\nderived from certain metaphysical and epistemic positions. The next\nthree sections sort the issues in a way familiar among analytic\nphilosophers in aesthetics and philosophy of art, according to whether\nthe issues concern a) descriptions of instances of the art form, b)\nunderstanding (and interpretation) of instances of the form, and c)\nevaluations of such instances. However, some elements of theater not\ndiscussed in this entry are otherwise interesting in their own right,\nfor example: the relationship between theater and music (and the\nspecial case of musical theater); the relationship between theater and\ndance (as a related but historically distinct kind of performance);\nthe relationship between theater and architecture (which yields a\nfocus upon scenography); the relation between acting and portraiture\n(people describe acting as \u201cportraying a character\u201d); the\nrelationship between narratives in theater and narratives in video\ngames (and questions about immersion and interactivity); the\nrelationship between acting and story-telling; the relationship\nbetween theater and narratology (and the distinction between narrative\nand non-narrative theater); the relationship between theater with live\nhuman actors and theater with puppets; and so on.\n", "toc": [{"#PhilTheaHistDiveTheaTradAntiTheaPrej": "1.

Philosophy of Theater, Historical Diversity of Theatrical Traditions, and the \u201cAnti-Theatrical Prejudice\u201d\n1.1 The Historical Diversity of Theatrical Traditions\n\nAlthough some of the following contrasts have more to do with the\nmeans of theater than with its ends, the point is that, historically,\ntheater never has had just one form.\n\nTheater might be thought of as singular and unified. One reason for\nbelieving this has to do with the phenomenon known as \u201cthe\nanti-theatrical prejudice\u201d, an animus towards theater that has\nbeen expressed by philosophers and theologians as well as theater\ntheorists and practitioners (and that is more fully described in\n \u00a71.3).\n While it has been alleged by some that distrust of theater practices\nis present in every culture, Jonas Barish, who coined the phrase\n\u201cthe anti-theatrical prejudice\u201d, does not claim this kind\nof ubiquity. The idea that it is ubiquitous may be mere speculation\nand not based on any historical evidence. If it is not a universal, it\nrepresents a preoccupation arising in only one of the four regions of\nthe globe in which theater originated as a distinct set of social\npractices aimed at portraying aspects of human life.\n\nOther traditions appear to have originated in ways that are\ndistinguishable from European theater (which originated in Athens).\nThe African (Yoruba) tradition of theater emerged initially from\nmasquerades celebrating ancestors (Adedeji 1969, 1972). Yet some\ntraditions seem to have arrived fully formed: the Sanskrit\nTreatise on Theatre (Natya Shastra, Ghosh (trans)\n1951) offers, at a very early time (somewhere between 200 BCE and 200\nCE), a reasonably complete list of topics any treatise on theater that\nis focused on dramatics should include (acting, dance, music, dramatic\nconstruction, architecture, costuming, make-up, props, the\norganization of theater companies, the nature of audiences, theater\ncompetitions, and so on) (Schwartz 2004). Unlike Athenian theater, and\nits legend about the first actor, Thespis, human actors were not\nalways the first evidence of theater. The early form of theater in the\nHan Dynasty in China consisted largely of shadow-puppet theater. The\nmuch later Tang Dynasty (618\u2013907) is most famous for developing\na form of theater that would be recognizable to Europeans as\ntheater, were it not for the fact it was largely musical.\n\nThe diversity of theatrical forms is also revealed by the study of\ntheatrical performances and their literatures that arose at different\ntimes within Japan. The oldest form is Noh theater (originating around\n1300 and continuing to the present), which can be characterized not\nonly by having different aims than its, possibly Chinese, predecessor\nform, but also by being largely dependent on its performers being\nproficient in either pantomime or vocal acrobatics or both. Bunraku,\nin contrast (originating around the mid-1500s and still being\nperformed), is a form of theater that consists of large puppets with\nvisible puppeteers dressed in black to imply invisibility,\nwith the dialogue spoken by a single person who uses extensive vocal\ntechnique and range to present the language and expression of the\ndifferent characters. Kabuki theater (beginning at the end of the\n1500s) is also distinguishable from Noh theater, if not in subject\nmatter (most of its subject matter comes from Noh or Bunraku theater),\nthen in form because it employs dance, singing, pantomime, as well as\nphysical acrobatics. Even more distinctive\u2014and as distant from\nthese predecessors as one can imagine\u2014is Butoh (originating\nafter World War II) that includes dance, performance, and abstract\nmovement, in the service of challenges to public authority by means of\npresenting grotesque imagery, \u201cforbidden\u201d topics, as well\nas absurd environments and situations. Butoh is performed in white\nmake-up and may be purely conceptual, having no movement at all.\n1.2 Philosophical Underpinnings in Theater Studies and Performance Theory\n\nDiversity in the histories and forms of theater has made it difficult\nfor theorists within any theater tradition to arrive at a sound\nanalysis that also has the promise of being extensionally adequate.\nThis situation is exacerbated by the difficulty in drawing a\ndistinction between philosophy of theater on the one hand, and theater\nstudies or performance theory on the other. There are two ways in\nwhich this distinction may been drawn.\n\nFirst, the discussion of theater in so-called \u201cAnalytic\nPhilosophy\u201d has rarely focused on the social or moral effects of\ntheater (with Cavell 1987 as one exception). Those discussions have\nbeen mostly in the form of determining the epistemological and\nmetaphysical status of the art form (Beardsley 1958; Danto 1981;\nLevinson 1996; D. Davies 2004; S. Davies 2006). But, in theater\nstudies, performance theory, and so-called \u201cContinental\nPhilosophy\u201d (Bergson 1889 [1910]; Deleuze 1968 [1994]; Heidegger\n1950 [2008]; Badiou 1990 [2013]) theater frequently has been addressed\nin the form of criticisms or defenses of the practices of theater in\nterms of the moral or social effects those practices have had;\nalthough in most of those cases, ethical considerations have rested on\nmetaphysical views.\n\nSecond, philosophy of theater might be distinguished from theater\nstudies or performance theory by the following facts: most\nphilosophical theories have emphasized descriptive issues,\nwhereas most theater studies or performance theories have emphasized\nnormative issues. Discussions of theater concerned with\ndescriptive issues typically ask what acting and spectating\nare, what the relation is between theatrical practices and practices\nin other art forms, what theatrical criticism is, and so on. The\ncontrasting normative theorizing can be illustrated by what\ntheater theorist Philip Zarrilli has called \u201cacting\ntheories\u201d, where we find particular ideologically inflected\ntheories\u2014e.g., by or based on Konstantin Stanislavski, Bertolt\nBrecht, and so on\u2014specifying ways in which to act\nsuccessfully in theater (Zarrilli 2002b: 3; Zarrilli 2007: 636).\n\nOne route to providing a sound analysis that has been taken in theater\nstudies and performance theory, since at least the 1960s, has been to\nappeal to some broader understanding of the human condition found in\nphilosophical reflections. This was possibly the expression of a hope\nthat in philosophy one might find something more universal than\ntheater itself; and if that led to fruitful explorations of theater\npractices, that would be a relevant form of imprimatur.\nHowever, as Marvin Carlson makes clear, theater artists are\nnot different from artists of other kinds in reacting\nprimarily to the thoughts and practices of their immediate\nartistic predecessors. So, although this route was taken by\ntheorists, this is not the route taken in theater or performance\npractice. Moreover, any plausible way of making out what a theater or\nperformance theory is\u2014as for example, taking\n\u201ctheory\u201d to refer to \u201cstatements of general\nprinciples regarding the methods, aims, functions, and\ncharacteristics\u201d of theater\u2014is unlikely to enable us to\nmaintain a bright line between philosophy of theater and theater\ntheory (Carlson 1984 [1993: 9]). Nevertheless, in an entry on the\nPhilosophy of Theater, it is important to note this prominent\ntheoretical strategy.\n\nThe most influential attempt of this kind rested on a popular set of\ntheories about language owing much of their provenance to the work of\nlinguist Ferdinand de Saussure (1916 [1977]) and to certain literary\ntheories that Saussurean linguistics informed as well. This attempt\nwas made in the form of semiotic theories of theater (Ubersfeld 1976\n[1999]; Eco 1977; Elam 1980; Pavis 1982; Fischer-Lichte 1983 [1992]).\nThese theater or performance theories involved applications from\nlanguage, conceived as a sign-system, to the theatrical event, which\nwas conceived of as either a single complicated sign-system or as a\ncomplicated conjunction of various sign-systems. And these theories\ncontinue to be influential in reflections on theater. But it soon\nbecame evident that the materiality of the actor\u2019s body marked a\nlimit of what can be analyzed in terms of semiotics, in terms of signs\nand meanings. For in some performances bodies seem not to mean\nsomething but to be something, namely, themselves (States\n1985; Sofer 2003). Treating material things, such as props, as\n\u201csigns\u201d not only makes it difficult to say what is and\nwhat is not a material object, it also renders inexplicable the\npleasure that spectators find in props and theater sets qua\nmaterial objects. However, the materiality of the performer\u2019s\nbody and of props, while challenging to semiotic analysis, is not, at\nleast according to some, a fact that presents an insuperable barrier\nto a more sophisticated semiotic theory. A standard (although partial)\nargument here is that, since anything can function as a prop for\nanything else in a theatrical performance, then anything just does act\nas a \u201csign\u201d when it appears in a performance (Elam\n1980).\n\nIn contrast, phenomenological theories of theater, resting on the\nphilosophical phenomenology of either Edmund Husserl (1913 [1981]),\nMartin Heidegger (1950 [2008]), Maurice Merleau-Ponty (1945 [2012]),\nor Bruce Wilshire (1982), gave rise to phenomenological theories of\ntheater (Carlson 1984 [1993], States 1985, Rayner 1994, Garner 1994).\nThe motive for phenomenological theorizing about theater, in large\npart, had to do with retrieving for theater studies and performance\ntheory the spectator\u2019s appreciation of the materiality of what\nhas been performed. The single most important achievements of this\nmovement were a) putting the spectator\u2019s position foremost and\nb) regarding the spectator as someone who engaged in processes of\nunderstanding on the basis of both cognitive and affective responses.\nMerleau-Ponty, for example, was famous for making the observer\u2019s\nperception of the world paramount. This could have translated\ninto spectator-centered theories of theater and theater cognition.\nUnfortunately, most phenomenological research of theatrical\nproductions focuses on either the plays themselves, as works of\ndramatic literature, or on the techniques of staging, principally the\nactor\u2019s techniques. This orientation towards the means\nof producing performances, rather than the conditions of their\nreception, is fairly common among theater studies and performance\ntheory. As a result, the writings of many phenomenologically oriented\ntheater or performance theorists only begin with descriptions\nof a spectator\u2019s experience and the cognitive challenges\nspectators face. This often has had the effect of estranging their\nviews from attempts to answer the classical questions of aesthetics\nand philosophy of art, which are often drawn from the point of view of\nthe amateur spectator or audience (Kristeller 1951:\n517\u2013521).\n\nMaterial offered by speech act theories in philosophy\u2014by J. L.\nAustin (1962) and John Searle (1969)\u2014have given rise to\n\u201cspeech act\u201d theater studies and performance theories.\nThis is perhaps because the idea of thinking of a word \u201cnot as\n[an expression of an] idea but as action, as gesture\u201d was\nalready a familiar albeit contested idea among such theorists (Carlson\n1984 [1993: 398]). These philosophical theories about the nature of\nlanguage utterance hold that there are more ways in which to\ncommunicate some attitude about a content than by asserting it first\nand only then expressing an attitude (see \u00a73 of the entry on\n speech acts\n as well as \u00a75.2 and \u00a76.1 of the entry on\n assertion\n in this Encyclopedia). A performative utterance is one that aims at\nachieving some state of affairs in the world rather than reporting\nwhether the state of affairs obtains, and such an utterance could fail\ndue to certain \u201cinfelicities\u201d of circumstance of speaker,\nlistener, or environment. Interestingly both Austin and Searle thought\nthat the utterances of actors, because actors were merely pretending\nto do things (see\n \u00a72.2),\n were not genuinely performative utterances. However, these ideas\nabout performative utterances gave rise to views like Judith\nButler\u2019s\u2014who used them in an argument, specifically with\nrespect to gender, that we should \u201ctake the social agent as\nan object rather than the subject of [a] constitutive [speech]\nact\u201d and that we should \n\n\nunderstand constituting acts not only as constituting the identity of\nthe actor, but as constituting that identity as a compelling illusion,\nan object of belief. (Butler 1988: 520) \n\n\nMore to the point of this entry, the ideas of Austin and Searle also\ngave rise to the thinking of theorists focused mainly on what\nperformance or theater could be or do (Saltz 1991a; Rozik 1993).\n\nIn contrast to the four fairly separate disciplines that are involved\nhere\u2014philosophy, philosophy of theater, performance theory and\ntheater studies, together with performance and theater\npractices\u2014a recent view suggests there is but one overarching\ndiscipline, namely \u201cperformance philosophy\u201d, wherein\nperformance is its own kind of thinking which is, itself, a kind of\nphilosophizing. This recent view is not, at least currently, widely\ncredited either by philosophers of theater or very many theater or\nperformance theorists (Puchner 2013). But it is now the basis of a new\ndiscipline with its own professional association and its own journal.\nLike many theater or performance theories, it takes its inspirations\nfrom philosophers, notably Gilles Deleuze (1968 [1994]) and Francois\nLaruelle (1996 [2013]).\n\nTo see how this goes, first suppose one argues that thinking about\ntheater can be teased apart into three distinct practices: the\nphilosophy of theater which is concerned with \n\n\nclarifying and/or defining the central concepts that organize the\npractices of theater\u2026, scrutinizing what those concepts\nentail\u2026, and identifying and addressing the disjunctions,\nanomalies, contradictions, and paradoxes that combining concepts\nsometimes entails; \n\n\ntheater theory which yields empirical results about the\nactual practices of theater, \u201cisolating the component parts of\ntheatre and explaining how they operate\u201d, whether as a kind of\n\u201creverse engineering\u201d characteristic of the\n\u201cscholarly theatre theorist\u201d or as a \u201csearch for\ngeneral empirical principles or methods that will bring about coveted\nresults\u201d as is characteristic of the \u201cpractical theatre\ntheorist;\u201d and criticism which is also empirical but\n\u201cpreoccupied with saying what is special about the [particular]\nworks in question\u201d (Carroll and Banes 2001: 158, 159, 160). Then\nsecond, if one thinks this might not be a mistaken view of\nthe nature of philosophical reflection so much as a\n\u201cnarrow view\u201d of what philosophical reflection\nmight amount to, one might instead conceive of \u201cperformance as a\nsite for immanent thought\u201d and seek to avoid the implication\nthat the only thing theatrical performance can do is illustrate a\ntheory or a bit of philosophical reflection (Cull 2013; Cull \u00d3\nMaoilearca 2018).\n1.3 The \u201cAnti-Theatrical Prejudice\u201d\n\nThe so-called \u201canti-theatrical prejudice\u201d has been a\nfeature of Western European theater since the very beginnings of both\ntheater and philosophy. It is, moreover, an issue that theater studies\nand performance theory have focused a fair amount of attention upon.\nJonas Barish identified its roots in the dispute, referred to in the\nIntroduction to this entry, between Plato and Aristotle over the\nnotion of mimesis and the value of theatrical practices\nwithin the good city (Barish 1966, 1981). Two later periods of\nphilosophical reflection on human practices stand out as concerned\nnearly exclusively with the morality of theatrical practices\nthemselves: during the period of the early Latin Church fathers, and\nduring the eighteenth century (Tertullian and Jean Jacques Rousseau\nare good examples). The degree to which the distrust of theater in\nthese periods was grounded in the earlier differences between the ways\nPlato and Aristotle had understood mimesis is still much\ndebated (Puchner 2013). The interest in and estimations of the social\nand moral effects of theatrical practices, on which the alleged\n\u201cprejudice\u201d has been grounded, staged a resurgence in the\nliterary and artistic period known as Romanticism (Friedrich Nietzsche\nand John S. Mill are good examples). And this worry about, or even a\ndistrust of, theatricality has continued into the present, but\ninterestingly enough, now among theater practitioners and theorists\nthemselves (Schechner 1992, and both Bertolt Brecht and Samuel Beckett\nprovide good examples, see also Puchner 2001).\n\nHowever, this viewpoint is often grounded in metaphysical and\nepistemic questions about what a theatrical performance is and how a\nspectator understands a theatrical performance of some kind (for\nexample, as a literary performance or one that is actual and\nphysical). This viewpoint is also often motivated by moral and social\nviews, not just about performances but also about performers. But it\nis often not clear what relationship this viewpoint has to the actual\npractices of the art form (Puchner 2013: 548). So even if the\nmotivations for the view can and should be criticized, the viewpoint\noften seems to be less \u201ca prejudice\u201d than a considered\njudgment resting on prior argued-for epistemic, metaphysical, or moral\npositions. And this leads one to wonder if there is anything special,\nor especially troubling, about the general social or moral problems\nassociated with theater in these periods at all. In short, it is\ndifficult to determine whether and when this animus is actually\naberrant\u2014and genuinely prejudicial\u2014or if it is of\na piece with standard examinations of social and moral effects of\ntheatrical practices. That said, it is worth noting that suspicion of\ntheatrical practices seems to be a persistently recurring and\ncharacteristic attitude within Western European philosophical, social,\nand political traditions.\n2. Describing an Instance of Theater\n2.1 Ontological Questions\n\nWhat is a work of art? Are all works of art alike? How so, or how not?\nWhen asked to determine what sentences are about, philosophers often\nwill want to know what objects, properties, or relationships the\nobjects of a certain bit of human discourse are and what the referents\nof its nominal and pronominal phrases are. The answers to these\nquestions might well be taken to be the basic ontology of that\ndiscourse. In this sense, the word \u201contology\u201d is playing\nthe same role it plays in, for example, computer science: and it\nanswers the question, \u201cWhat is there?\u201d The most common\npractice in doing ontology of art is to use a roughly Quinean approach\n(Quine 1948) since it seems a fairly pragmatic way to undertake the\ninitial task in the ontology of art (see Pettersson 2009 for a detailed discussion).\nDissenters from this common practice have often pursued mereological\naccounts (in terms of parts and wholes) of how certain ostensible\n\u201cmultiple instances\u201d of works of art are related to the\nworks themselves (Cook 2011; Hackett 2017).\n\nBut some cast doubt on the utility of terms like \u201cworks of\nart\u201d and \u201cartworks\u201d altogether, arguing that, at\nleast with respect to literary and musical communication, the choices\nopen to us seem to be language-dependent in a way that makes it\ndubious to construe them as elements in \u201cthe basic furniture of\nthe world\u201d, so to speak, even if there is nothing intrinsically\nproblematic within our ordinary descriptions of art using these terms\n(Rudner 1950; Cameron 2008; Pettersson 2009; but for arguments for the\nindispensability of works-talk see S. Davies 2003). And others raise\nthe equally serious question about whether all events and objects that\nwe describe as art can be distinguished cleanly into single-instance\nand multiple-instance objects or events (Currie 1988; Hazlett 2012),\nlargely on the grounds that any work of art can be repeatable\nand that the alleged distinction turns out to be an artifact of our\ncurrent technological capabilities rather than an enduring feature of\nsome kinds of art.\n\nThat said, many philosophers who have accepted the terms \u201cworks\nof art\u201d or \u201cartworks\u201d have also accepted some\ndistinction between multiple-instance and single-instance works of\nart. Allan Hazlett begins an essay on repeatable artworks, ones that\nhave multiple instances, this way:\n\n\nThere seem to be repeatable artworks. Plays and musical works, like\nShakespeare\u2019s Hamlet or Mussorgsky\u2019s\n\u201cPictures at an Exhibition\u201d, can be performed again and\nagain; installations, like Sol LeWitt\u2019s Wall Drawing\n#260 (1975), can be installed over and over; dishes of food, like\nJean-George Vongerichten\u2019s tuna tartare, can be prepared many\ntimes (Hazlett 2012: 161).\n\n\nIn light of this distinction, determining the kind of entities works\nof art are depends upon explaining and defending one of the following\nproposals: \n\nthe view using C. S. Peirce\u2019s (1906)\n\u201ctype/token\u201d distinction, wherein some works are\nthemselves both tokens and types and others are types that take\nmultiple instances as their tokens; \n the view that all works of art are extended individuals and what\nappear to be mere instances are, in fact, parts of the larger whole work; \n the view that works of art are instances of \u201cnorm\nkinds\u201d, wherein they function as types (or kinds) and\nalso have a normative dimension that enables us to determine if\ninstances of the kind are properly or improperly formed; and \n the view that works of music, dance, and theater are\n\u201cstages\u201d of \u201cperduring\u201d objects and events\n\n\n\n(see \u00a74 of the entry on\n the history of the ontology of art\n and Rohrbach\u2019s article (2012) in the Routledge Encyclopedia\nof Aesthetics, third edition, for in-depth surveys of these\nviews; and also see work by Peirce 1906: 505ff.; Wolterstorff 1980; Predelli\n2001, S. Davies 2003; D. Davies 2004, Thomasson 2005; Dodd 2012; and\nMoruzzi 2018.\n\nOne striking feature of the disputes about these proposals is that\neach of these proposals makes sense of one class of them but has\ndifficulty explaining\u2014or explaining away\u2014certain others of\nthem. This may be due in part to the wide diversity among artistic\nevents and objects. But, whatever the cause, one result is that\n\u201cincreasingly, the very rules of engagements are as much the\ntopic of philosophical dispute as the ontological proposals\nthemselves\u201d (Rohrbaugh 2012).\n\nWhen it comes to narrowing down to the ontology of theater there are\nmore specific questions that make any approach to the ontology of\ntheater more difficult. The first question concerns how we determine\nwhat one must say there is within the discourse of theater. On the\ncommon view outlined above, the most basic ontological question is\n\u201cWhat do we (have to) say there is?\u201d with respect to some\ndomain of discourse (Quine 1948). On the Quinean view one should first\ndetermine what the best empirical theory is in some field of inquiry,\nsecond regiment that theory in terms of some system of formal logic,\nand then, thirdly, ask what objects satisfy the existentially\nquantified variables within that regimented discourse. That will be\nthe ontology of that field of inquiry. But before we can ask what one\nmust say there is with respect to theater, one first must ask what the\ndiscourse is that generates the descriptive facts over which\nthe variables of quantification are supposed to range. That is, to\nwhat discourse is this method for determining the ontology of theater\nto be applied? Any answer we can currently give to this question will\nbe the devastating observation that what exactly the descriptive facts\nare that are discussed in the relevant discourse, and thus what the\nactual discourse is, are themselves questions that are not actually\nsettled.\n\nThe second, and perhaps the more practically pressing of the two more\nspecific questions that must be asked regarding theater, is\n\u201cWhat exactly are instances of theater: performances,\nproductions, or illustrations of dramatic literature?\u201d It is\ncommonly assumed by theater or performance theorists that the correct\nanswer is \u201cperformances\u201d. But this is both far from clear\nand under-argued (see Hamilton 2007: 3\u201316 for a discussion of\nthis point). One way to address this question is to ask a more\nfundamental question about theater, as Paul Woodruff does (2008): what is it to make something\nworth watching? Another is to ask, as David Saltz, James Hamilton,\nNoel Carroll do (2001): what it is that people are interpreting and\nevaluating when they discuss theatrical performances and what is an\ninterpretation? Yet another is to ask, as David Osipovich does\n(2006): what is a theatrical performance actually like in the\nexperience of those who present it and those who attend it at the time\nof the performance itself? And a further is to ask, as W. B. Worthen\n(2007) and Hamilton (2009a) have: what is the relation between\nperformances/productions and texts\u2014i.e., specifically in\nrelation to works of dramatic literature? Once again, \u201cthe rules\nof engagement\u201d, as Rohrbaugh calls them, are as much disputed as\nthe proposals themselves.\n\nNotably, the methods for responding to this question seem to be\nepistemic rather than ontological\u2014that is, they seek to defend\nan answer to the question based on the role each of the possible\nanswers would play in our reasoning about theatrical performances. And\nthey seem to yield no distinctive proposals regarding the ontology of\ntheater. Moreover, to the extent they do yield such proposals, they\noften seem to offer empirical, rather than a priori, evidence\nto support the answer their view entails (Fine 2012). Thus, the\nstandard answers to the second question\u2014which certainly\nappears to be ontological\u2014point in a different\ndirection, namely to epistemic concerns about how we know what it is\nwe know about theatrical performances and less about what we must say\nthere is. And this is despite the fact that, in Carroll\u2019s case\nat least, the answer is derived from a general ontological view,\nnamely, his widely discussed view about the ontology of mass art.\n2.2 Theater and Performance\n\nSo far, this entry has treated theatrical performance and performance\nart as fundamentally the same. But that is regarded as a contentious\nstandpoint by some theater and performance theorists. And the\ndistinction between theater and performance, even if only alleged, has\nbeen a growing concern in theater studies and performance theories\nsince at least the beginnings of the twentieth century, when Spingarn\nand Matthews debated whether one should emphasize either the\n\u201ctheatricality\u201d of theater or the adherence of a\nperformance to a written script (Matthews 1910; Spingarn 1911 [1931]).\nTheir debate concerned text-based theater, and they each thought of\n\u201cperformance\u201d in terms of theatrical performances\nof texts. But the wrinkle is that if there is a profound\ndifference between performance as an art and theater as\nan art, then before one can describe an instance of theater, one\nhas to know it is one and not an instance of performance art\ninstead.\n\nDespite the differences in the background thinking used in developing\ntheir theories, some theater studies and performance theorists have\nnevertheless held one view in common, namely, that there is a distinct\ndifference between acting and performance. Roughly that difference has\nbeen explained this way: when acting one is not being oneself, but one\nis being oneself when performing. This has turned out to be a troubled\nexplanation. For what then are we to say about the actor in a\nplay\u2014the real, flesh and blood actor (Auslander 1986\n [2002])?[1]\n\nA leading approach to this problem in theater studies and performance\ntheory relies on anthropological investigations into ritual, turning\nthem into a theory of performance that distinguishes between the\nrole of performer and the role of actor as\nexhibiting different kinds of human behavior (Turner 1982; Schechner\n1988). This way of distinguishing between the practice of theater and\nthe practice of performance has been persuasive to some theater and\nperformance theorists because of a feature of the avant garde\ntheater practices in the traditions of Antonin Artaud and Jerzy\nGrotowski (Artaud 1938 [1958]; Grotowski 1968 [2002]). It is alleged\nthat in those practices the actor seeks to be, or at least to appear\nto be, metaphysically present to the\nspectator\u2014appearing to speak spontaneously even when scripted,\nappearing to have authority in the theater about the direction of the\nplot, again even when scripted, and appearing to deliver words that\nare meant, perhaps unambiguously, and could be taken as\nthough spontaneously delivered. In the latter case especially, actors\nre-enforced what theorists following Derrida called\n\u201clogocentrism\u201d. In contrast, some theorists held the\nperformer (the non-actor) is free to be, as it were,\n\u201cabsent\u201d (Fuchs 1986).\n\nResponding to the challenge posed by these proposals, and noting both\nthe absence of any definition of performance and any attention to the\nhistorical facts about the ways the relevant practices actually\ndeveloped (see\n \u00a73.1\n below), it has been argued that the most plausible way to\ncharacterize \u201cperformance\u201d has its roots in standard\nethnological and ethological theories, and characterizes\n\u201cperformance\u201d as a kind of \u201cdisplay behavior\u201d\nthat is exhibited by members of various species, including our own\n(Hamilton 2013). In this account, however, performance is not an\nalternative to acting but more like acting\u2019s \u201cgenus\u201d\nto which it corresponds as a \u201cspecies\u201d.\n\nIf right, this would dissolve the issues raised among performance and\ntheater theorists. For rather than being different kinds of human\nbehavior, they would be modeled as the same kind, but with different\nscope. However this proposal confronts a robust history of thought to\nthe contrary, conflicts with a sizable amount of the common discourses\namong theater and performance artists themselves, and challenges the\nleading theory of acting among those philosophers and cognitive\nscientists who study the phenomena of pretense and imagination, and\nwho either might or do think of acting as pretending rather than as\ndisplay behavior (Searle 1975; Lewis 1978; Harris et al. 1993;\nKavanaugh and Harris 1999; Nicholls and Stitch 2000; Goldstein and\nBloom 2011; Brown 2017).\n3. Understanding a Theatrical Performance\n3.1 Recognizing an Instance\n\nIf, as historically has been claimed, there is nothing more to\ntheatrical performances than illustrations of a text (Spingarn 1911\n[1931]), then there might be a quick way to answer the question,\n\u201cHow does a spectator recognize an instance of theater?\u201d:\nto encounter an instance of theater is nothing more than to encounter\na dramatic text. But, even so, you must still figure out precisely\nwhat sort of illustration of a text a live performance is\n(Worthen 2007). If one takes the view that one should think of a\ntheatrical performance as something to be described, interpreted, and\nevaluated on its own terms, there is much more to do (Hamilton\n2007).\n\nThis may seem obvious: one encounters an instance of theatrical\nperformance by means of the senses and by their typical operation,\nleading to a recognition of the social form, assuming there is a\nsocial form of sufficient familiarity. But, even when everything in a\nspectator\u2019s repertoire of sensory apparati and social\nnous is functioning normally, there is a problem with any\nspectator\u2019s ability to discern genuinely theatrical behavior\nfrom the non-theatrical.\n\nOne source of this problem is the phenomenon sometimes called\n\u201cthe theatricality of everyday life\u201d. Suppose human beings\npresent themselves in everyday life and that they do so in\nthe same ways that actors do. How then could anyone tell if/when\nsomeone else is acting or not (Goffman 1959)? The easy answer to this\nhas to do with framing effects. A person is acting only if they are\nperforming for an audience on stage (Thom 1992). That is, they act\nonly if they are within a socially agreed upon frame. And, indeed this\nis the answer that Erving Goffman gives to his own question.\n\nThis problem also arises from considering the differences between\nartistic performance and performance art (see\n \u00a72.2\n above). No\u00ebl Carroll has argued there is no definition of\n\u201cperformance\u201d in terms of necessary and sufficient\nconditions, but only coincidental histories. In the 1960s, theater\nperformers became dissatisfied with the forms and institutions of\ntheater and found they could express those dissatisfactions more\nreadily in the context of gallery spaces in which they were allowed\nthe freedom to carry out theatrical experimentation. At the same time,\nartists became dissatisfied with the forms and institutions of the\n\u201cartworld\u201d\u2014museums and galleries\u2014and found\nthey could express those dissatisfactions in the form of performances\nthat\u2014coincidentally\u2014looked a lot like theatrical\nperformance (Carroll 1986a). But if this is the case, how can anyone\ntell whether one has encountered a case of what Carroll called\n\u201cartistic performance\u201d or of what he and many others have\ncalled \u201cperformance art\u201d? The natural answer is historical\nand empirical: either it does not, nor should not, matter which one it\nis or, if it does matter, then probably one can have an answer if one\ncan detect which institution is being challenged.\n\nThe most natural way to respond to the problem with a\nspectator\u2019s ability to discern a theatrical performance is by\nappeal to some sort of institution or framing device. But such an\nanswer to this problem has the following challenge to consider: in\nAugusto Boal\u2019s so-called \u201cinvisible theater\u201d,\naudiences are usually unaware that some of the people around them are\nactors, acting out a prepared script or scenario, getting a\nconversation going, and being prepared to leave their audience to\ncontinue to discuss the issues raised by the actors, usually about\nclass distinctions and exploitation (Boal 1974 [1979: 143\u2013147]).\nThe challenge is that actors in \u201cinvisible theater\u201d have\neliminated the very institutions or frames that are assumed to be\navailable to spectators.\n\nBoal calls this kind of activity \u201ctheater\u201d because it\ninvolves actors, scripts or scenarios, and audiences. One might argue\nthat in these circumstances there is not, in fact, an\naudience, for they certainly do not recognize themselves as\nsuch. If an audience member\u2019s self-recognition of her social\nrole, qua audience, is necessary for an event\u2019s\ncounting as theater\u2014and not merely her presence in that\nrole\u2014then Boal is simply mistaken in calling it theater,\nalthough it might be \u201ctheatrical\u201d in some tenuous\nsense.\n\nA substantial literature has developed concerning the question whether\nthe presence of an audience is necessary for a theatrical event. Paul\nWoodruff defines theatrical performances as events in which someone\nmakes something \u201cworth watching\u201d (Woodruff 2008:\n18). He also claims that nothing is a theatrical event\u2014although\nit may be a performance\u2014unless there actually is someone\nwatching. However, one could define theater as the making of\nsomething worth watching even if no one is watching it; and something\nshould tie these two thoughts together. Paul Thom (1992) does supply a\nconnection\u2014because he, like some theater theorists, thinks of\ntheater in terms of speech acts and holds that theater addresses its\naudience by uttering an imperative addressed to a particular subject\nordering them to attend to the one making the utterance. This seems,\nat least, to require there be an addressee (but see D. Davies\n2011: 173, for a contrary view). David Osipovich (2006) has held a\nsimilar view to Thom\u2019s but for a different kind of reason.\nOsipovich\u2019s view is based on the demonstrable fact that\nperformers respond to their audiences. They do this, for example, when\nfeeling the \u201cheat\u201d or the \u201cchill\u201d of an\naudience and sometimes adjust their performance to fit the audience\nthey have at a given performance. It follows from this that any\nperformance will be different in some respects from any other\nperformance. A different view from these holds that a theatrical\nperformance is still a theatrical performance even if there is no\naudience. This is because, although the performance may be\nprepared with an audience in mind, the presence of the\naudience is not required for the display of the routine that\nconstitutes the performance. It just happens not to be displayed\nto anyone (Hamilton 2007; D. Davies 2011).\n\nTo respond adequately to Boal\u2019s challenge, views like\nThom\u2019s, Osipovich\u2019s, and possibly Woodruff\u2019s need to\nanswer a further question\u2014whether an audience must not only be\npresent as an audience but also be aware of their role qua\naudience. Yet, on the views of Hamilton and Davies, one need not ask\nthis question because audiences do not even need to be present in\norder for there to be a performance. But, assuming we can credit\nBoal\u2019s case of \u201cinvisible theatre\u201d as a case of\ntheater, it suggests there are two classes of theatrical performances,\none in which spectators do not know that there is a performance at all\nand one in which spectators can determine, either by explicit\nappeal to or an implicit reliance upon an institution or a set of\nframing social practices, that they are watching, hearing, smelling\n(and perhaps tasting or touching) a theatrical performance that\nengages them. And the latter is by far the larger of the two\nclasses.\n3.2 Perception and Grasping a Performance\n\nMoreover Boal\u2019s \u201cinvisible theatre\u201d also suggests\ntwo further things: one an observation; the other a question. The\nobservation is that the pull of Boal\u2019s case is felt because the\ninteraction between spectators and performers can be explained as\nconsisting only of the ordinary uses of one\u2019s sensory apparatus.\nSecond, Boal\u2019s \u201cinvisible theatre\u201d prompts the\nnon-skeptical question, namely, how do spectators grasp and understand\nthe content of theatrical performances in either of the two\nclasses?\n\nA straightforward answer to the question is given in terms of the\nobservation, namely, \u201cby means of the senses\u201d. This answer\ninvokes an idea of human perception and attention that is\nnaturalistic, requiring us to appeal to nothing more than the basic\nfeatures of perception and attention that are studied empirically by\npsychologists and neuropsychologists. This leaves room for\nphilosophers of theater\u2014and other philosophers of art\u2014to\ndiscuss what the objects of attention and perception are in\ntheatrical performances and other forms of art. For example, one\nsuggestion that might be made with regard to theater and performances\nis that the objects attended to in them are the gestures, sounds, and\nspeeches presented by performers and the props, sets, and so on,\ndisplayed in the performance (Melinger and Levelt 2004; Novack and\nGoldin-Meadow 2017); and the mechanism by which this happens is\ndeliverable by standard empirical psychology (Rutherford and Kuhlmeier\n2013). Moreover, it will be useful to philosophers of art and\naesthetics to note that most perception is, as our colleagues in\nneuroscience and neuroaesthetics say, \u201ccross-modal\u201d,\ninvolving information delivered by more than one sense modality\n(Driver and Spence 2004; Kastner 2004; Nanay 2012; Seeley 2013). But,\nassuming this is on the right track, what does a spectator then\ndo with her perceptions of gestures, sounds, and speeches, in\norder to understand the content of the performance she has\nwitnessed?\n\nOne framework, or model, for understanding what is done when a\nspectator grasps or understands a performance might be supplied by\nusing signaling theory, much as that theory has been developed as a\nmodel for understanding social relations and social norms (Skyrms\n2010; Wagner 2015, and see the entry on\n social norms).\n The rough idea is that a sender, in this case a performer, signals a\ncontent to a receiver, the spectator, a content which the spectator\ncannot see at the moment (e.g., how the performance will go, what to\nexpect next, what kind of thing to expect). And then the receiver\nperforms some action\u2014and indeed that action can be as minimal as\ntheatrical spectators\u2019 actions often are\u2014which indicates\nto the performer whether or not they have understood the signal.\nPerhaps unlike standard signaling games, the relevant actions in this\ncase are reasoned to by the spectators from the data they are\ngiven in the performance. Accordingly, this enhanced model would\nrequire spectators to update their expectations upon being presented\nwith new signals, or new data (Perfors et al. 2011). And because the\nsame data can be used to increase one\u2019s credence in an\nexpectation and to help one determine the right category in\nwhich to place one\u2019s expectations, this model would also allow\nfor prior knowledge to play the kind of role in the understanding of a\nperformance that seems appropriate (Tenenbaum et al. 2011). It would\nallow for both \u201cbottom up\u201d and \u201ctop down\u201d\nguidance of perception and reception that comports well with a\npriori as well as empirical reasoning about theatrical and other\nkinds of perception and reception. This would include\nevent-segmentation in narrative understanding and scene gist\ndetection, as two fairly low-level examples (Zacks et al. 2007; Larson\nand Loschky 2009). It would also include such higher levels examples\nas recognition of styles and genres in performance (Walton 1970; Saltz\n2006; Liao and Protasi 2013).\n\nNone of the details in this view are settled, nor is there agreement\nthat it is even on the right track as a way to account for what it is\nthat spectators understand in watching a theatrical performance.\nJerrold Levinson has suggested an account for musical\nunderstanding and No\u00ebl Carroll has put forth another for\nunderstanding the movies created in the Hollywood system\n(Levinson 1997; Carroll 1986a, 2008). Yet no alternative to the\naccount just sketched has been set forth with respect precisely to\ntheatrical performances.\n\nLevinson\u2019s is a \u201cconcatenationist\u201d account of what\nit is to understand and enjoy music. In its boldest form, Levinson\nwrites, concatenationism is a conjunction of four propositions.\n\n\nMusical understanding centrally involves neither aural grasp of a\nlarge span of music as a whole, nor intellectual grasp of large-scale\nconnections between parts; understanding music is centrally a matter\nof apprehending individual bits of music and immediate progression\nfrom bit to bit.\nMusical enjoyment is had only in the successive parts of a piece\nof music, and not in the whole as such, or in relationships of parts\nwidely separated in time.\nMusical form is centrally a matter of cogency of succession,\nmoment to moment and part to part.\nMusical value rests wholly on the impressiveness of individual\nparts and the cogency of the successions between them, and not on\nfeatures of large-scale form per se; the worthwhileness of experience\nof music relates directly only to the former. (Levinson 1997:\n13\u201314)\n\n\n\nLevinson\u2019s account is developed and refined in considerable\ndetail over the course of his book. And there are two features of this\naccount that bear special mention here. One is the fact that each\nlistener must update her expectations about what is going to happen in\nthe music at each moment of listening. The other is that no\nlarge-scale musical structures are invoked in this story\u2014and in\nthis latter regard it is, perhaps, best described as a bottom-up\nonly tale of musical perception.\n\nCarroll\u2019s view is an \u201cerotetic\u201d (or\nquestion-and-answer) theory of movie comprehension. The shape of this\nview is as follows: the data a movie-goer encounters generate the\nquestions which the movie-goer consciously or unconsciously asks, the\nmovie-goer waits for new data that supplies answers to those\nquestions, and then the movie-goer updates and comprehends. What makes\nthe view distinctive\u2014and what has generated some controversy\nabout it\u2014is what the view depends on: the creation of so-called\n\u201cHollywood style\u201d film conventions. By means of those\nconventions the problem of attention focus is resolved. For the\nconventions themselves (for example, variable framing) are the very\ndevices in which specatorial attention is directed (Carroll 1985:\n188). This set of effects has resulted in what is rightly called the\n\u201ctyranny of movies\u201d with respect to visual attention\n(Loschky et al. 2015) and is clearly a top-down theory.\n\nHowever, the problem of focusing spectator attention looms large as a\nproblem in theatrical performances and is one of the crucial questions\nthat a theater company faces in developing a performance (Chaikin\n1972). The data are presented by the performance, but the data are\nwhatever the spectator experiences. They may be data about\nevents that are transpiring outside of and prior to the performance.\nThey may be about the kind of events transpiring in or\noutside of the performance. Rather than asking questions and waiting\nfor the performance to deliver data to supply answers to those\nquestions, spectators are engaged in updating their expectations from\nthe onset of the data. Crucial to this process is that a spectator\nmust determine where to focus her attention. Spectators enter a venue\nof presentation with at least some expectations already in place.\nSpectators who are experienced may have quite a few expectations about\nthe performance but, if they are not experienced theater-goers, they\nwill have very few of such expectations. What is needed is a model\nthat is consistent with at the least the first observation about the\n\u201cconcatenationist\u201d theory of musical comprehension that\nLevinson presented\u2014the need to update in the moment. It should\nalso be consistent with much of Carroll\u2019s \u201cerotetic\u201d\ntheory of the comprehension of Hollywood Style movies, but it needs to\nbe wider in its application than Carroll\u2019s view, which seems\ntailored to movies where the attention focal point is much easier to\nmanage than it is in the theater. And, it should offer an explanation\nof how a spectator determines the kind of performance with\nwhich she is confronted.\n4. Evaluating a Theatrical Performance\n\nAgainst the background in\n \u00a72.2\n and\n \u00a73,\n it seems clear that to evaluate an instance of theater demands a\ndecision on the part of the evaluator: to evaluate either the text (as\nan instance of dramatic literature), the performance or production (as\nan instance of a public event), or both of them in relation to each\nother. If both, the evaluator is able to consider the intersection\nbetween performance or production and text, to assess the performance\nor production in relation to the text and to assess the text\nagainst the performance of it. Despite their disagreements on the\nontology of the art form and the pattern such an ontology should take,\ncriticism of both text and performance is what Carroll, Saltz, and\nHamilton all appear to have in mind (Saltz, Hamilton, and Carroll\n2001). Moreover, this appears to be congruent with the practices of\ncritics as well.\n\nBefore discussing how this is to be done, however, there are two major\nissues about criticism, or \u201cevaluation\u201d, of any works of\nart that should be described. For both of them will affect how to\nunderstand the evaluation of theatrical performances.\n4.1 Theoretical or Practical Criticism\n\nThe first major question concerning artistic evaluations is whether\nthey are to be understood as a process of theoretical or of practical\nreasoning. The majority view among analytic philosophers of art now\nfavors the former, and their view is that the conclusion of any act of\nreason-giving is, perhaps must be, a proposition, something to which\none might give some degree of credence (or assent to believing) if the\nreasoning is good. But recent work has revived an earlier view, due to\nArnold Isenberg (1949), that descriptions plus interpretations\n(\u201ccharacterizations\u201d) guide us to evaluations understood\nas \u201cperceptions\u201d. The objection to this view is that \n\n\nif critics simply guide us in perception, then what they do\nnot do is give us a reason which supports an ascription of\noverall value to an artwork. Instead, they simply tell us something\nabout how they see the work, and try\u2014by whatever means\nnecessary\u2014to get us to see it in the same way. This, many have\nargued, fails to qualify as reasoning. (Cross 2017: 302)\n\n\nRobert Hopkins has responded to this objection by recognizing that\nperception is a more complex affair in the case of\n\u201cperceiving works of art\u201d than are those perceptions we\nordinarily have occasion to experience. The important thing is that\nperceptions of works of art have a kind of conceptual content that\nrequires justification\u2014of the sort that critics can supply by\nappeal to premises about the work (Hopkins 2007). Another attempt to\nrespond to the objection is to argue that criticism provides us with\nreasons\u2014premises\u2014aimed at getting us to act\ntoward works of art in ways that might best be construed\n\u201cparticular acts of looking, contemplating, listening,\nreflecting, or otherwise engaging with the artwork\u201d (Cross 2017:\n304, emphasis added).\n\nBut suppose there is a difference between assessments of the value of\nworks of art and assessments of whatever it is we might do\nwith respect to works of art. Could it not be that either of those, as\naims of reasoning, might be legitimate? Those who reject the\n\u201cpractical vs. theoretical reasoning\u201d distinction on the\ngrounds that all reasoning is means/ends, and who thus hold that\nwhether a bit of reasoning is good or bad cannot be determined without\nfirst determining what the reasoner\u2019s end is, will find\nboth Isenberg\u2019s (or the \u201cIsenbergean\u201d) view\nand the objection to it considerably less interesting. Applied to\nevaluations of theatrical performances, qua performances, we\nalso have no reason to choose between these various forms of\nreasoning.\n4.2 Aesthetic and Artistic Evaluations\n\nThe second major question about evaluation concerns whether there are\nany non-aesthetic artistic values. Behaviorally there is a clear\ndifference between aesthetic and non-aesthetic artistic values,\nindicated by the fact that appeals to aesthetic responses do not\nexplain many individual\u2019s interest in works of art (Carroll\n1986b; Stecker 2006). There is disciplinary support for a distinction\nhere: the study of the felt quality of perceptions of the senses is\nconducted by cognitive scientists and neuroscientists, while the study\nof the historical practices of art making are studied by\nanthropologists and art-historians. But this behavioral way of\nremarking the distinction still needs an explanation. We might explain\nthis distinction by appeal to a metaphysical difference between\naesthetic properties and artistic properties. Robert Stecker\u2019s\nepistemic way of explaining the distinction is by means of proposing a\n\u201ctest\u201d\u2014as he calls it\u2014for whether an\nevaluative verdict regarding a work of art appeals to an aesthetic or\nan artistic value:\n\n\nartistic value derives from what artists successfully intend to do\nin their works as mediated by functions of the art forms and\ngenres to which the works belong. [So] does one need to understand the\nwork to appreciate its being valuable in that way? If so, it is an\nartistic value. If not, it is not. (Stecker 2012: 357)\n\n\nThis position has had its detractors (Lopes 2011; Dodd 2013), but\nsomething quite like it has also had defenders who have argued, for\nexample, against the view of \u201cappreciation as liking\u201d and\nin favor of \u201cappreciation as sizing up\u201d (Carroll 2016).\nEach of these notions of appreciation appeals to David Hume\u2019s\nclaim that \u201cgood sense\u201d is necessary for avoiding\nprejudice and for being able to discern the relevant features of a\nwork. But, as Hume saw, good sense is not essential to what Carroll\ncalls \u201cappreciation as liking\u201d. Whereas, Carroll notes, it\nis both essential and crucial to \u201cappreciation as sizing\nup\u201d.\n\nThe crucial thing to notice about this distinction between aesthetic\nand artistic value is that it moves us away from thinking of the value\nof a work of art as residing in the experience it might provide us (a\nview that David Davies has called \u201caesthetic empiricism\u201d)\nand suggests, at the very least, that we do not look only to\nexperience for the source of values in a work of art. One place to\nlook is suggested by the position of Stecker himself, who requires\nwhat he calls \u201cunderstanding\u201d a work of art by means of\nexamining \n\n\nwhat artists successfully intend to do in their works as\nmediated by functions of the art forms and genres to which the works\nbelong. (Stecker 2012: 357) \n\n\nOr we might look at what No\u00ebl Carroll has called \u201can\nappreciative heuristic applied to art\u201d which requires one to\n\n\n\n1) identify [a work of art\u2019s] intended purpose or purposes and\n2) determine the adequacy or appropriateness of its form\u2014its\nformal choices\u2014to the realization or articulation of its\nintended purpose (or purposes). (Carroll 2016: 4\u20135) \n\n\nEach of these suggestions hold that artistic evaluations are\nassessments of the artistic achievements that the work has\nmade. And we might propose that aesthetic evaluations of the\nvery same works (and much else in the world as well) could turn out to\nbe, as Paul Ziff has argued, the registration of preferences for\nthe experiences provided by the work (or other object) (Ziff 1979\n[1984]). This analysis already seems to be adopted by Stecker (2006)\nin what he calls the \u201cbroad\u201d analysis of aesthetic\npleasure, which he endorses.\n\nIf we follow Ziff\u2019s suggestion about aesthetic verdicts, then\njust about anything could be grounds for aesthetic\nevaluations of a theatrical performance. But Ziff\u2019s suggestion\nmay not be the right idea about aesthetic verdicts. According to\nJerrold Levinson, Hume appealed to what he called \u201cideal\njudges\u201d to resolve the puzzling conflict between the fact that\nthere are demonstrably better and worse artworks and the fact that our\ntastes\u2014what we prefer\u2014differ with respect to works of art\n(Hume 1757). Levinson, who refines and defends Hume\u2019s solution\nto this conflict, notes that if we have good reason to appeal to\n\u201cideal critics\u201d, who possess good taste and who can\ndiscern which objects are worthy of aesthetic attention, both of the\nfact claims that appear to be in conflict could turn out to be true.\nAnd there are real advantages in Hume\u2019s solution: it seems to\nsquare with the fact we are able to learn from others, others whose\njudgment we trust, and so whose good taste should lead us to choose\nthe right works of art; and it also squares with the fact we do seem\nto acquire \u201ctaste\u201d from following the judgments of others\nwhom we trust.\n\nThe \u201cideal critics\u201d solution has its problems, however.\nBriefly they concern three things. First, does the artistic\nappreciation of a work of art depend on first-hand acquaintance with\nthat work of art? Whether there is independent empirical evidence that\nthis appeal\u2014to the need for first person experience in order to\nsupport any verdictive judgment\u2014is a vexed problem. Second, how\ndoes the ideal critic come to her/his views in the first place? It is\neither by a process of learning from others whom they regard\nas ideal critics or it is by a process independent of the existence of\nideal critics. If the latter, then we don\u2019t need the\n\u201cideal critics;\u201d all we have to do is undergo that\nindependent process ourselves. If the former, then we have a either a\n\u201cvicious infinite regress\u201d with no rational starting place\nin the chain or we rely on the testimony of others (which in this area\nis also vexed). And, third, what is the case for the claim that there\nare \u201cideal judges\u201d in the first place (Ross\n2008)? Is there any reason to believe there are any?\n\nThe attractiveness of Ziff\u2019s point of view is that it allows for\na quite different form of solution to the puzzle created by our two\nfacts, one that gives each fact a different kind of explanation. The\nfirst claim\u2014that there are demonstrably better and worse\nartworks\u2014asserts the artistic merits of a work of art\nby reference to the achievements made or not made in the\nparticular work of art. Whether such achievements are or are not made\nin the work is an objective question of fact, and so could be made on\nbehalf of everyone. The second claim\u2014that our tastes differ with\nrespect to works of art\u2014asserts the aesthetic value of\na particular work of art to some individual or group on the basis of\nthe aesthetic qualities that that individual or group\nprefers. Since preferences are usually subjective or\nsometimes inter-subjective, these assessments are made only on behalf\nof particular individuals or groups.\n\nOne advantage of this solution is that it squares with our standard\nways of dealing with the lack of artistic value of forgeries.\nFor, despite the fact forgeries may provide more\n\u201cappreciative experiences worth having\u201d than even the\noriginals may, they may still be objectively less valuable, in the\nsame way that a piece of property may be less valuable, from a\nrealtor\u2019s point of view, than some potential homeowners think it\nis because they feel a preference to own it (Carroll 2016). Another\nadvantage is that it also squares with everyday kinds of remark about\nthe aesthetic value of some works of art being \u201cmerely\nopinions\u201d, because those comments are explicitly about what we\nlike, and are not really about what is better or worse. Claims that\nare genuinely about what is better or worse in a work of art rest on\nconsiderations of the achievements in them, not on our varying\npreferences for or against them. Moreover, this solution is better\npositioned to explain why some works of art do not even aim to provide\nhigh-quality aesthetic experiences. And, finally, it results in no\ncontradiction between either finding that a work is good but not to\none\u2019s liking or finding that a work is bad but is something one\nreally likes, for example a so-called \u201cguilty pleasure\u201d\n(Carroll 2016).\n\nApplied to theatrical performances the distinction between aesthetics\nand artistry seems solid enough even if we have no final determination\nof how to explain the distinction. Yet, no matter how we work that\nout, it seems that spectators and critics will need to provide and\nexplain a rather complicated set of things; for now it appears they\nmust provide both aesthetic and artistic evaluations. This is\nmade more complicated in those cases in which the artistic\nachievements a work makes do consist in provision of\npreferred experiences. Moreover, focusing just on the artistic\nappreciation of theatrical performances and accepting the achievement\nstory about what the artistic value of a work of art is, there are\nstill two further tasks. If theatrical texts and performances are\nworks belonging to different forms of art, then artistic evaluations\nof theater will still come in two kinds, namely, the achievements of\ndramatic texts, and the achievements of performances.\n4.3 Achievements in Theater\n\nA given piece of literary writing \u201cfor the stage\u201d may be\neither a work of dramatic literature or a script, either a writing to\nbe read for certain literary features and values or a writing to be\nused in a quite different way. That a bit of writing functions as a\nwork of dramatic literature does not alter the fact that the\nrelevant effects, features, and values to be analyzed and examined are\nexactly those that are analyzed and examined with respect to any other\nnarrative literary work. Crucially, a work of dramatic literature does\nnot require theatrical performance for the realization of those\neffects, features, or values (Worthen 2007, Hamilton 2009b).\n\nThis way of construing writing \u201cfor the stage\u201d does not\npreclude what may be called a \u201cliterary theater\u201d. If we\nthink of scripts as \u201cscores for action\u201d (Saltz 1991b), we\nmay also think of them as providing particular orderings of the\ninformation an audience will encounter (Stoppard 1999). Some scripts\ndo this to excellent effect; in theater parlance, they \u201chave\nlegs\u201d. Like some gymnastic or jazz routines, they are frequently\nrepeated and approximated because they yield performances that mark\ngreat achievements. Writing may contribute to this achievement for\ntheater because it allows greater control over the flow and order of\ninformation than do complex scenarios crafted for improvisational\nsequences or even than do scenarios and language passed down from\nperformer to performer over generations. Whatever the case may be with\nrespect to the value of scripted performances over performances\ngenerated in other ways, however, a script driven theater is likely to\nbe a literary theater simply because it will produce some written\nscripts that can\u2014indeed will\u2014also be taken to function as\nworks of literature.\n\nLiterary analyses of a work of dramatic literature that happens to get\nused as a script may or may not be useful for performers. The content\nof a theatrical performance is not fully governed, deliverable, nor\nretrievable by a written text. Texts\u2014which are relatively\n\u201cthin\u201d\u2014are underdetermined by performances (Ball\n1983; Worthen 2007, but see Goodman 1968: 210\u2013211 for a contrary\nview). If this is right, a quite different set of standards for\nmeasuring the achievements of performances, per se, is\nrequired.\n\nAs of this date, very little progress has been made in philosophy on\nwhat those particular standards might be. And perhaps that debate is\nbest left to practicing critics, performers, and performance or\ntheater theorists. But some philosophical headway can be made by\nconsidering what is required for assessing the achievements of\nperformances.\n\nTo ask what achievements are possible in theatrical performances\nrequires that we understand what an achievement is in the first place.\nOne source of thinking about this will certainly come from empirical\nwork on achievements in education\u2014correlating them with other\nfactors, but not specifying what achievement, per se,\nconsists in (for example, Burke and Sass 2013). Another source will\nundoubtedly come from those concerned with \n virtue epistemology,\n virtue ethics, or perhaps perfectionist\n accounts of value. Gwen Bradford has examined the basic idea of\n\u201cachievements\u201d in several publications (Bradford 2013,\n2015, 2016). Bradford describes achievements as requiring two\nthings:\n\n\nFirst, achievements are characterized by a process-product structure:\nall achievements have a process, which culminates in a\nproduct. Second, the process of an achievement is\ndifficult. Something must be difficult to some sufficient\ndegree in order to be an achievement; after all, if running a marathon\nand writing a novel were easy, we wouldn\u2019t be inclined to call\nthem achievements. \u2026[and] for now we will suppose that an\nactivity is difficult just in case it requires effort from the agent\nengaging in the activity. (Bradford 2013: 205)\n\n\nShe ultimately denies that it might make a difference if the product\nis independently valuable, on the grounds that at least as a matter of\ncodifying our everyday assessments of achievement we do count\nthings\u2014running a marathon, scoring well on an\nexamination\u2014as achievements even though they have less\nindependent value than, say, saving thirty lives from otherwise\ncertain death by fire, or finding a cure for polio (Bradford 2016:\n797). Accordingly, if one is to mark achievements in theatrical\nperformance, one must state clearly what the process of preparing a\nperformance involves, why the tasks undertaken in that process are not\neasy, and how these achievements are to be noticed and assessed.\n\nIn preparing and performing a routine, performers make choices\nabout what to utter and what to do. Performers also\nchoose how to utter what is uttered and how to do\nwhatever it is they do. And, performers determine what to do and how\nto do it for every moment of the performance. These\ndecisions, so far, concern what each performer utters and does\nindependently of other performers, but performers usually do not make\neven these decisions in isolation from each other. Another aspect of\nthese decisions requires concerted, perhaps collective, effort. Any\ncompany needs to decide where they wish to direct attention at each\nmoment and how they will do that. Some of those decisions involve\nthinking about such things as how performers are situated relative to\neach other and to the audience in the performance space. Many\ndecisions that determine how attention gets directed involve deciding\nthe manner and timing of each performer's utterances in relation to\nthe content, manner, and timing of the utterances of other performers.\nSimilarly, to regulate the attention of audiences, companies think\nabout how what each performer is doing relates to what the other\nperformers are\n doing.[2]\n Clearly, none of these tasks, especially the ones demanding\ncoordination among the performers, is particularly easy.\n\nBeyond this, spectators must be able to determine the style in which a\nperformance occurs in order to be guided to relevantly correct\nexpectations. Consequently, performers must make stylistic choices as\nwell. For it is actually sequences of features (resulting from\nsequences of choices) that give shape to a performance over time and\nguide spectators\u2019 expectations. This will be so if the sequence\nis a convention governed by some overall goal the performers have. And\nagain, none of these tasks, especially since stylistic choices demand\ncoordination among the performers, is particularly easy to succeed\n at.[3]\n\nThis leads to a set of ideas about how spectators measure success and,\nin particular, what they are able to say about performers, sets, and\noverall mise-en-sc\u00e8ne, when they detect\nfailures. If a spectator is unaware of a convention\u2014a\nsequence of choices governed by some overall goal\u2014as a\nconvention, and if the presence of that convention is responsible for\nthe aspects of the work that are present to be appreciated, then that\nspectator simply cannot appreciate that work, at least not for those\naspects. This is partly because appreciation depends on having some\nlevel of understanding of what one is experiencing. Understanding\nrequires spectators to offer hypotheses regarding what performers are\nup to in a performance, to test those hypotheses against the actual\ndetails of the performance, usually as it unfolds, and to assess the\nachievement the performance manifests given its aims and its context.\nOnly spectators who understand performances and their features are\nable to offer the relevant kinds of hypotheses.\n\nSuch spectators are able to detect and explain failures of skill. A\nsuitably backgrounded spectator who thereby understands the\nconventions and styles in play will know what to watch for. A\nperformer will fail who does not exhibit the relevant features in\nvoice, speech, mood, movement, or action. Such a failure may be a\nresult of lack of skill. A spectator who understands performances and\ntheir features will not only notice this but will also be able to\nexplain this failure due to lack of skill to other spectators.\n\nAt the level of style, failures in performance can occur in at least\nthree ways. They can occur if some of the features grouped together\ninto conventions do not clearly and coherently induce the\neffects\u2014the goals\u2014at which they appear to be aimed. Or they may\noccur if the performers do not understand what effects the conventions\nthey have adopted actually induce and, so, have made choices quite at\nodds with their own self-conscious aims. They may also occur if the\naims of the performers are unclear and they have selected a mix of\nconventions that is confusing to an audience. If a spectator is\ntracking the adequacy of hypothesis about what performers are doing\nand she understands performances and their features, she will notice\nthese failures and be able to explain them to others as well.\n\nThese are the basic achievements a theatrical performance aims at; and\nthese are the kinds of successes and failures that some audience members detect.\nArtistic evaluations of theatrical performances qua\nperformances are determinations that achievements of these sorts are\nmade or not made.\n", "bibliography": {"categories": [], "cat_ref_text": {"ref_list": ["Adedeji, Joel A., 1969, \u201cTraditional Yoruba Theater\u201d,\n<em>African Arts</em>, 3(1): 60\u201363. doi:10.2307/3334461", "\u2013\u2013\u2013, 1972, \u201cThe Origin and Form of the\nYoruba Masque Theatre\u201d, <em>Cahiers d\u2019\u00e9tudes\nafricaines</em>, 12(46): 254\u2013276. doi:10.3406/cea.1972.2763", "Aneja, Deepali, Alex Colburn, Gary Faigin, Linda Shapiro, and\nBarbara Mones, 2017, \u201cModeling Stylized Character Expressions\nvia Deep Learning\u201d, in <em>Asian Conference on Computer Vision \u2013\nACCV 2016: 13th Asian Conference on Computer VisionTaipei, Taiwan,\nNovember 20\u201324, 2016, Revised Selected Papers, Part II</em>,\nShang-Hong Lai, Vincent Lepetit, Ko Nishino, and Yoichi Sato (eds.),\n(Lecture Notes in Computer Science 10112), Cham: Springer\nInternational Publishing, 136\u2013153. doi:10.1007/978-3-319-54184-6_9", "Artaud, Antonin, 1938 [1958], <em>Th\u00e9\u00e2tre et son\ndouble</em>, Paris: Gallimard.
