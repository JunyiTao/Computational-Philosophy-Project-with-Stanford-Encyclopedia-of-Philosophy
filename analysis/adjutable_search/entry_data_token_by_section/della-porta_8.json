    "main_text": "Optics and the emergent experimental culture\n9. Optics and the emergent experimental culture\n\nPorta\u2019s ideas on optics gradually developed over his long career. His\napproaches to the field were holistic and his characteristic\nperceptual understanding of images was not necessarily geared towards\nthe development of a coherent optical theory. Motivated by an interest\nin the theatricality such devices could produce, Porta\u2019s optical\nendeavors were geared towards controlling or manipulating visual\nperception (Dupr\u00e9 2007). The texts on plane and curved mirrors,\nlenses, and glass orbs are closely tied to devices which had the\ncapacity to generate marvelous optical illusions (such as cabinets of\nmirrors, images that appear to be suspended in the air, spy-glasses,\nor the camera obscura). The same is true of Porta\u2019s optical\nanalysis of the anatomy of the human eye.\n\nFor example Porta\u2019s experiments with the construction of\nparabolic mirrors made from glass resulted in the invention of an\nimproved camera obscura that\u2014in theory at least\u2014had the\npotential to produce images that were not upside down. Porta\nrecommends this artifact, a combination of a convex lens and a concave\nmirror, for setting up theatrical shows. He uses the same setup of\nlenses and mirrors for his spy-glass. This telescope became a very\nimportant tool for astronomers during the scientific revolution. Yet,\nin Porta\u2019s day, telescopes were usually considered to be\ninstruments for image-making rather than tools for measuring the\npositions of stars (Dupr\u00e9 2007, Reeves 2008, Dijksterhuis\n2017).\n\nIn recent years, some researchers on Porta\u2019s optics have\nemphasized that this was not necessarily a shortcoming. Porta\u2019s\nhard work to improve and investigate the qualities of optical devices\nwith the potential to create marvel generated not only some important\ndiscoveries, it also contributed to optical theory. The problem of the\nrelationship between the point of inversion and the focal point in\ncurved mirrors is a case in point, because Porta\u2019s work contributed to\nthe emergence of the concept of virtual and real images (Borrelli\n2014, 2017). In this case, Porta\u2019s hands-on approach proved\nparticularly fruitful as it successfully translated artisanal\nknowledge to the domain of literary culture of the sixteenth century.\nThis was highly innovative, because optical theorists still were\nlargely ignorant of the heuristic potential of the new artifacts\nproduced from cristallo, or Venetian soda glass.\n\nEssentially, Porta\u2019s strategy consisted in first gaining an\nunderstanding of the effects of simple artifacts and then building on\nthat knowledge to construct (or imagine) ever more complex devices.\nHis particular mode of investigation of the physical properties of\nartifacts in conjunction with diagrams served Porta to design new\nartifacts with even more amazing properties. Borrelli has described\nthis as a process of \u201cbottom-up modeling\u201d and as markedly\ndifferent form medieval and traditional perspectivist optics.\nEncompassing a more comprehensive approach to optics than for instance\nJohannes Kepler, Porta conceived of optics as related to images as we\nperceive them and not to what rays do. This led Porta to compare the\nhuman eye to a camera obscura; it was a claim that met the criticism\nof Kepler (Borrelli 2014, 2017, Dijksterhuis 2017). Yet, and in marked\ndifference to Francis Bacon, who used Porta\u2019s experiments as\nopenings for new experiments, Porta\u2019s endeavors were geared\ntowards the production of artifacts that would render stable and\nrepeatable effects. This approach also made up for an important part\nof Porta\u2019s reception in seventeenth-century England. (Jalobeanu\n2020).\n\nDespite the many contradictions and problems in Porta\u2019s works that\nuntil recently have lead to an overwhelmingly negative assessment of\nhis role in the history of science, more recent studies have\nidentified Porta\u2019s combination of artisan culture and\ndiagrammatic methods as extremely important for later research\nstrategies in the experimental science of the seventeenth century. As\nBorrelli has claimed in a series of publications, Porta\u2019s\nobdurate ways of working with real artifacts in his experimental\nspace, in conjunction with diagrams and other paper tools would, with\nhindsight, easily translate into what was soon to become modern\nlaboratory practice. Even so, these efforts came comparatively late in\nPorta\u2019s long life. The De telescopio remained in manuscript\ndraft and did not represent Porta\u2019s public persona as magus.\nNevertheless these texts testify to the author\u2019s versatility in\naccomodating his own endeavor to the most recent trends in early\nmodern science. (Frangenberg 1991, Fumikazu 2011, Borrelli 2014,\n2017).\n\nHence, by the standards of his day, Porta\u2019s ceaseless endeavors\nwere neither unsophisticated, undignified, nor disingenuous. Quite on\nthe contrary, Porta\u2019s activities could well rank as privileges\nof members of the upper classes, and especially so as long as they\nwere geared towards theatricality, and the planning of devices of\nwonder. Accordingly, during the seventeenth century Porta was\nperceived as a virtuoso rather than as a natural magician. (Jalobeanu\n2020). As many scholars have aptly pointed out, such artifacts did not\nnecessarily need to be useful or effective or to engender rational\nreflection. The production of marvel was a respectable end in itself\n(Wolfe 2004 Lazardzig 2008 Eming, 2020).\n",
