    "main_text": "History: A Genealogy of Latin American Feminism || The Years of Silence (1950\u20131970)\n1.3 The Years of Silence (1950\u20131970)\n\nCoined by Julieta Kirkwood of Chile as the \u201cyears of\nsilence\u201d, the years spanning from 1950\u20131970s/1980s saw\nwomen (mostly middle-class) increasing their political presence by\nparticipating in popular social movements and political parties\n(Kirkwood 1986: 70). However, their social and political participation\nlacked explicit feminist demands. Although not a strict set of dates,\nthe years of silence lasted well into the 1980s for some parts of\nLatin America (e.g., Chile); these years, the time of baby boom and\npopulism, were politically rife in post-World War II Latin America. It\nwas also a time characterized by McCarthyism which precipitated the\nU.S. intervention in Guatemala and the Dominican Republic with\nintentions of warding off communism (Gargallo 2004: 94). These years\nalso witnessed the fall of the Somoza dictatorship in Nicaragua in\n1956 as well the rise of conflict and military regimes in countries\nlike Colombia, Argentina, and Chile. Hence, political mobilization\ntook place around the changing landscape of Latin America, and\nmiddle-class women participated, but their explicit role in these\nmovements is complicated by the fact that their presence and impact\nwere not readily documented (Ungo Montenegro 2000: 45).\nNotwithstanding, the years of silence were not quiet on pages. Women\nduring these years were literarily active and produced texts that\nprivileged their position which was theoretically underappreciated\nbecause of their literary style (Gargallo 2004: 95).\n\nThe relationship between literature and philosophy has been explored\nas part of the Latin American philosophical tradition. For instance,\none position holds that the Latin American literary tradition of essay\nwriting contains insights that can ameliorate the troubles of Latin\nAmerican philosophy at large (Pereda 2006: 196). Nevertheless, the\npoints of literary departure for many Latin American philosophers are\nseldom women, although Latin American women in the middle of the\n20th century wrote amply about their identities in\nrelationship to gender, race, ethnicity, and nationality (Gargallo\n2004: 97). It is important to appreciate that not all women\u2019s\nwriting during this time pushed for social change. Some narratives\nplayed into patriarchy and machismo, forced marriage, and\nsocial isolation. At the same time, some women presented narratives\nthat exposed doubts and resistances to the patriarchal ordering of the\nworld (Gargallo 2004: 97). Unfortunately, women writers of this time\nare often folded into literary traditions, hindering their recognition\nas thinkers and theorists. One notable example is Rosario Castellanos\nof Mexico.\n\nIn 1950, at the age of 25, Castellanos defended her master\u2019s\nthesis in philosophy at Universidad Nacional Aut\u00f3noma de\nM\u00e9xico (UNAM). The project, titled Sobre cultura\nfeminina, explored women\u2019s role in the production of\nculture (Gargallo 2004: 89). She was a prolific writer. However,\nCastellanos is largely remembered as a literary figure and a poet. It\nwas not until 1974 (after her death), that the publication of her most\nfamous work El Eterno Feminino was recognized as\ntheoretically rich, speaking on themes of gender, ethnicity, and\nnationhood. Today, she is recognized as a leading voice in the\nfeminist movement of Mexico, her work arguing for the construction of\na feminine subjectivity that defies the identity imposed by\npatriarchal cultural norms. As a result, her work has aided in\nestablishing a different vision of political life for women in Mexico\n(Gargallo 2004: 90).\n\nThe 1950s\u20131970s was a fervent time of women\u2019s writing\nacross Latin America. Antonia Palacios of Venezuela wrote Ana\nIsabel, una ni\u00f1a decente (1949), Castellanos of Mexico\nwrote Bal\u00fan-Can\u00e1n (1957), and Albaluc\u00eda\n\u00c1ngel of Colombia wrote Estaba la p\u00e1jara pinta\nsentada un verde lim\u00f3n (1975). Further notable examples\ninclude the Mexican poet Enriqueta Ochoa whose published works span\n1947\u20132008 and Marvel Moreno, one of the most influential female\nwriters of Colombia. In the 1980s, Moreno broke through the literary\nmold of her times marked by the work of Gabriel Garc\u00eda Marquez\nwith the publication of Algo tan feo en la vida de una\nse\u00f1ora bien (1980). The protagonists of the book, who are\nwomen, serve as vehicles for the exploration of life in a patriarchal\nsociety. Moreno placed value on providing a genealogy of women as her\nprotagonists (e.g., the daughter, the mother, the grandmother),\nreflecting the importance of transgenerational communication amongst\nwomen. Thus, some argue her works provide a thematic thread of\nrebellion that runs through the lives of women and unites them in\ntheir histories of resistance to patriarchal social orders (Gargallo\n2004: 106).\n\nWhile dubbed the \u201cyears of silence\u201d, the work of women\nwriters during this period did find voice through literature and\npoetry. Their theoretical reflections were subsequently appreciated\nwith the resurgence of feminism in the later decades.\n",
