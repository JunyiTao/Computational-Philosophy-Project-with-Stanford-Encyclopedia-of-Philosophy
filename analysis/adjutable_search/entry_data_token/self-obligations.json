Do we owe anything to ourselves?\n\nPhilosophers are torn. On the one hand, obligations to self are a\nmainstay of moral theories \u2013 most famously Kant\u2019s \u2013\nas well as ordinary thinking. It is not just academic Kantians who\nbelieve in making something of our lives and standing up for\nourselves. And yet, the idea of literally owing things to oneself can\nsound paradoxical. When I owe you $5, I am bound to pay. When you owe\nme $5, I can waive the debt away. Now suppose I owe myself $5.\nDon\u2019t I then have the power to waive my own obligation?\nBut then how could it bind me? An obligation I can escape at will is\nlike a prison with an open gate, a speed limit with no penalty. Such\nan obligation seems powerless, toothless, imperceptible \u2013 in\nother words, it seems like no obligation at all.\n\nThis paradox has cast a long shadow. In the 20th century,\nobligations to oneself \u201clargely disappeared from the radar of\nacademic philosophers\u201d (Cholbi 2015, 852), as the traditional\nquestion of what we owe to ourselves gave way to doubts about\nwhether such obligations are even coherent.\n\nBut in the new century, the topic has enjoyed a renaissance, with\nfresh theories cropping up for the first time in decades and\napplications arising across a range of fascinating issues: privacy and\npromises, self-respect and supererogation, tech-addiction and tattoos.\nSome have even wondered, echoing Kant, if the topic might lie at the\nvery heart of ethics.\n\nWe begin with the question of what obligations to oneself are supposed\nto be (\u00a71). From there we lay out the \u201cparadox\u201d and\nits history (\u00a72), along with the three theories that have arisen\nin response (\u00a7\u00a73\u20135). We conclude (\u00a77) after a\nsurvey of applied issues (\u00a76), focusing on topics of broad\ninterest, but sprinkling in a few specifics \u2013 like Kant\u2019s\nqualms about haircuts \u2013 for the sake of spice.\n", "toc": [{"#WhatObliOnes": "1.

What is an obligation to oneself?\n\nThe traditional examples of obligations to oneself are a hodgepodge,\nbut they basically come in two kinds: self-care and self-respect\n(Allen 2013, 854). Self-care is a matter of promoting our own\ninterests \u2013 pursuing our dreams, minding our health, preserving\nour lives. Self-respect, meanwhile, is less about what is good for us,\nand more about what is proper or dignified; think of prohibitions on\nsafe and profitable sex work, or taboos around painless suicide even\nin the shadow of an agonizing terminal disease. As these examples\nshow, self-care and self-respect can be in tension.\n\u201cDisrespecting\u201d oneself might be the best way to escape a\nmiserable death or a life in poverty.\n\nThe tension here is so deep that many philosophers claim to only\nbelieve in one of these two kinds of duty, while totally rejecting the\nother. At one point in his Lectures on Ethics [LE],\nKant suggests that we only owe ourselves respect:\n\u201cself-regarding duties\u2026have nothing to do with well-being\nand our temporal happiness\u201d (LE\n27:341).[1]\nUtilitarians, who think morality is all about well-being, are open at\nmost to duties of self-care; they do not share the Kantians\u2019\nconcerns about ending one\u2019s life or selling access to\none\u2019s body when the result is greater well-being overall (see,\ne.g., Meiland 1963).\n\nWith such stark disagreement, it is natural to wonder if the debate\nhere is really focused on a single concept of \u201cobligations to\noneself.\u201d In fact, it is often not. The variety in the examples\nreflects a more basic variety in concepts. The most crucial\ndistinction here \u2013 essential to everything ever written on\nduties to oneself \u2013 is between an obligation owed to\noneself, and one merely regarding oneself.\n\nSuppose you promise your friend to stop wearing tacky hats. As a\nresult of the promise, you owe it to your friend to dress better; in\nthis sense, the obligation is \u201cto\u201d your friend, not to\nyou. But this is still an obligation regarding you, in the sense that\nit concerns what you do to yourself. You are the one whose headgear is\nat issue. (This sort of example is common in the literature; see,\ne.g., Mavrodes 1964, 165\u201366; Timmermann 2006, 506.)\n\nIt is an open question what an obligation to someone consists in, if\nit is something over and above mere regard (see Thompson 2004 on\n\u201cbipolar normativity,\u201d Darwall 2006 on\n\u201csecond-personal\u201d address, and Schofield 2022 [Other\nInternet Resources]). \u201cInterest theories\u201d say that an\nobligation to you is somehow linked to what is good for you (see,\ne.g., Raz 1986, chap. 5). \u201cStanding theories,\u201d which are\nmore popular in writings on obligations to oneself, say that\nobligations to you put you in control. For Gilbert (2018) and Darwall\n(2006, 18), the distinctive thing is that you have the standing to\ndemand what is owed to you. For Schofield (2021, 52), the key is that\nyou get \u201ca rightful say.\u201d For Steiner (2013), you have the\npower to waive the obligation via your powers of consent.\n\nSuffice it to say, the exact essence of an obligation to oneself is\nstill up for debate. By contrast, everyone knows what self-regarding\nobligations are, and everyone agrees that we might have them \u2013\nduties to maintain one\u2019s health so as to take care of\none\u2019s family; to wear a mask to avoid spreading contagion; and\nso on. Indeed, it is hard to imagine an obligation that\nisn\u2019t somehow self-regarding.\n\nIt is far more controversial to say we have bona fide obligations to\nourselves \u2013 that is, owed to ourselves, strictly speaking, just\nas you might owe it to your friend to keep your promise. The idea of\nliterally owing something to oneself seems to imply that we have\nrights against ourselves, along with the power to release ourselves\nfrom duties (see \u00a72, below). To avoid this paradox, many\ntraditional \u201cobligations to oneself\u201d have been recast as,\nor replaced with, obligations merely regarding oneself. Aristotle\nargues that suicide is not an \u201cinjustice towards oneself,\u201d\nbut only towards the state that one is supposed to serve (1138a\n4\u20131138b 11). Some argue that self-care is not owed to oneself,\nor even to others; it is obligatory only in the sense that we have to\ndo it. (It is an \u201cundirected\u201d rather than a\n\u201cdirected\u201d obligation.) And the duty to develop\none\u2019s talents might be seen as part of a duty to promote the\ngood of others: think of a lifeguard swimming laps or a surgeon doing\nhand exercises.\n\nAnother way around the paradox is to say that obligations to oneself\ndon\u2019t imply any quixotic power of self-release. To make this\nview work, we need some way of interpreting \u201cobligations to\noneself\u201d so that they aren\u2019t quite like the legalistic\nobligations we get from promises and contracts. Some say\n\u201cobligations\u201d to oneself are in some sense non-legal;\nothers say one can owe things \u201cto\u201d oneself only in an\nattenuated sense; and some even consider shifting the referent of\n\u201coneself\u201d \u2013 perhaps we only owe things to our future\nselves, or one aspect of our psyche owes it to another.\n\nMuch as the Liar Paradox shaped modern theories of truth, the threat\nof paradox has profoundly shaped our theories of obligations to\noneself. Let\u2019s take a closer look at the paradox before tracing\nits influence on contemporary work.\n2. The Paradox of Self-Release\n\nWhat\u2019s so weird about obligations to oneself?\n\nOne thing to note \u2013 not quite our topic, but important to clear\nup \u2013 is that many moral wrongs can be done only to other people.\nYou cannot steal your own lunch money, deceive yourself with lying\npromises, or bop yourself on the head against your own will. Who could\nbe duped by a promise they know to be false? (See Hill, Jr. 1991,\n144.) How can one \u201csteal\u201d what one already owns? (See\nHaase 2014, 365.) How can one will things against one\u2019s own\nwill?\n\nThis familiar fact \u2013 that some wrongs can be done to others but\nnot to ourselves \u2013 is called the asymmetry of possibilities\n(Mu\u00f1oz and Baron-Schmitt 2022 [Other Internet Resources]).\nThis asymmetry constrains the scope of self-wronging; some naughty\ninteractions are impossible in the one-person case. But this does not\nrule out all possible obligations to oneself. There are still\nplenty of problematic things one can do to oneself: bodily harm,\nproperty damage, and so on. Could we wrong ourselves by doing such\nthings, or is there something fishy about the very idea of an\nobligation to oneself?\n\nNow the real paradox. The tension arises from the dual nature of\nobligations: they are supposed to be both binding and waivable. Your\nobligations \u201cbind\u201d you in the sense that you have to\ncomply, other things equal, or else you wrong the person to whom you\nare obliged. But this person can, if they like, waive the obligation,\nreleasing you from your duty. This duality is perfectly intelligible\nin the two-person case. If you owe your friend $5 for a fancy coffee,\nyou are bound to pay \u2013 you cannot simply opt out, as you might\nopt out of a mailing list or a volunteer trip. And if your friend\nwants to unbind you, they can do so unmysteriously, simply by saying\n\u201cMy treat.\u201d\n\nWhat if you owe something to yourself? Then the \u201cbinding\u201d\nseems to vanish. Since you can willy-nilly waive any obligation owed\nto you, you can willy-nilly waive any obligation to yourself. Any such\nobligation is therefore purely optional \u2013 which sounds\nincoherent, like an obligatory hobby or a mercenary passion\nproject.\n\nThe modern version of the paradox is due to Marcus Singer (1959, 203),\nwho frames it as an argument with three premises:\n\nIf A has a duty to B, then B has a\nright against A.\nIf B has a right against A, he [or she] can give\nit up and release A from the obligation.\nNo one can release himself [or herself] from an obligation.\n\n\nTogether, these ensure that one cannot have duties to oneself.\n(\u201cDuties\u201d are just \u201cobligations\u201d with fewer\nsyllables.) It\u2019s a punchy argument. Duties entail rights; rights\nentail powers of release; but one cannot release oneself from a duty.\nThe conclusion, for Singer, is that one cannot have a duty to oneself;\nthe very idea of such a duty is \u201cself-contradictory\u201d\n(1958, 203).\n\nSinger\u2019s spin on the paradox is clear and forceful. It also\ncrucially involves the concept of a right, which is used to link\nduties to the power of release. But otherwise, the puzzle merely\nechoes several historical sources, which Singer does not cite or\nengage with (see Cholbi 2015). For example, here is Immanuel Kant.\n\nIf the I that imposes obligation is taken in the same sense\nas the I that is put under obligation, a duty to oneself is a\nself-contradictory concept. \u2026 [O]ne imposing obligation\n(auctor obligationis) could always release the one put under\nobligation (subjectum obligationis) from the obligation\n(terminus obligationis), so that (if both are one and the\nsame subject) he would not be bound at all to a duty he lays upon\nhimself. This involves a contradiction. (Metaphysics of\nMorals [MM]\n 6:417)[2]\n\n\nNotice the same emphasis on \u201cself-contradiction.\u201d And here\nis Thomas Hobbes, discussing legal rather than moral obligations:\n\nThe sovereign of a commonwealth, be it an assembly, or one man, is not\nsubject to the civil laws. For having power to make, and repeal laws,\nhe may, when he pleaseth, free himself from that subjection by\nrepealing those laws that trouble him and making of new; and\nconsequently he was free before. For he is free, that can be free when\nhe will; nor is it possible for any person to be bound to himself,\nbecause he that can bind can release; and therefore, he that is bound\nto himself only is not bound. (1651 [1994, 174])\n\n\n\u201cHe is free, that can be free when he will\u201d is just\nanother way of saying that one cannot release oneself from a genuine\nobligation. When self-release is an option, one is never really\n bound.[3]\n\nWhat\u2019s the solution?\n\nWe have three options. The first is to follow the argument where it\nleads \u2013 namely, to Singer\u2019s nihilism, on which there is no\nsuch thing as a duty to self. The next option, which is the most\npopular among ethicists, is to defend unwaivable duties to oneself.\nFinally, some argue that self-release is not as incoherent as it\nsounds, and that we really do have waivable duties to, and maybe even\nrights against, ourselves.\n\nThe choice between these three options is a crossroads in moral\nphilosophy; in effect, we are choosing the place of the self within\nmoral theory. Singer says there is no place for the self in morality.\nThe Kantians \u2013 the chief defenders of unwaivable duties to self\n\u2013 are more likely to place the self at the privileged center.\nAnd those who believe in self-release see the self as just one moral\nperson among others, denying or downplay the specialness of\none\u2019s relation to oneself.\n\nOn what grounds have philosophers chosen one road over the others?\nWhere have their choices led them?\n3. Denying obligations to oneself\n\nLet\u2019s start with Singer\u2019s view, which is that, as shown by\nthe paradox, there can be no obligations to oneself. There may be\nself-regarding obligations owed to other people; there may be decisive\nreasons to be prudent. But no one ever literally owes anything to\noneself, morally speaking. On the extreme version of this view, no one\neven has a moral reason to promote their own interests as such (see,\ne.g., Finlay 2007).\n\nSinger gets points for dispensing with the paradox. He doesn\u2019t\nposit duties to self, and he has a principled reason for not doing so:\ngiven the possibility of self-release, a duty to oneself would not be\nbinding \u2013 which means it would lack the core property of any\nduty that deserves the name.\n\nThe challenge for Singer\u2019s view is that it is revisionary,\nobliterating half of the classic distinction between duties to self\nand duties to others \u2013 a distinction that \u201cseems well\nembedded both in traditional moral philosophy and in ordinary moral\nthinking\u201d (Singer 1958, 202).\n\nPerhaps it is all right for Singer to dispute traditional wisdom. It\nwould not be the first time a tradition got something wrong. Besides,\nas we have noted, there is an equally distinguished tradition of\nskepticism about obligations to oneself. Even Kant, the chief\ndefender of duties to self, has wary moments (see \u00a72, 4).\nDeference to the past isn\u2019t decisive here.\n\nWhat about ordinary thought? If duties to self are really\n\u201cembedded\u201d in common sense, that is certainly some reason\nto reject Singer\u2019s argument, or at least to look for ways\nout.\n\nSinger himself suggests that we should not take our ordinary moral\ndiscourse too seriously. When we talk of duties to oneself, our\nlanguage \u201cmust be metaphorical\u201d (1958, 203). He\nexplains:\n\nTo say that someone has a duty to (or owes it to) himself to do\nsomething is an emphatic way of asserting that he has a right to do it\n\u2013 that there are no moral considerations against it \u2013 and\nthat it would be foolish or imprudent for him not to. (1958, 203)\n\n\nSimilarly, Singer thinks, when you \u201cpromise yourself\u201d to\ndo something, you must really be expressing your resolve to do it (see\nalso Haase 2014, 364; Hills 2003, 131\u201333).\n\nThere are three questions we might ask about Singer\u2019s\ninterpretation of ordinary talk. First, Anita Allen questions why we\nshouldn\u2019t take people literally in these contexts:\n\nFigures of speech abound in language. But in the case of statements\nabout duties to oneself, why suppose we do not mean exactly what we\nsay? A moral theory should explain rather than discount inconvenient\nmoral discourse (2013, 859)\n\n\nSecond, and related, we could ask if Singer\u2019s position does\njustice to the thoughts behind the talk. Consider a few basic\nquestions: is it morally all right to risk dire injuries to oneself\nfor a cheap thrill? To debase oneself for a few bucks? To accept\nhumiliation from peers for the sake of fitting in? One might well say\nno, even if these actions are certain to harm nobody but\noneself. This is more than a linguistic habit that philosophers should\nbe able to explain. These are considerable \u2013 though still\ncontestable \u2013 moral intuitions, and the appeal to metaphors may\nnot be enough to overturn them.\n\nFinally, Singer\u2019s view seems to suggest that we should be happy\nto talk, at least metaphorically, of rights against oneself \u2013\nwhich, in fact, we are not. For Singer, \u201cpromises to\noneself\u201d are just statements of resolve, and \u201cduties to\noneself\u201d are exaggerated \u2018oughts\u2019. Presumably,\n\u201crights against oneself\u201d would be understood\nmetaphorically, as well. And yet, no one is willing to talk of rights\nagainst oneself. Why? The answer cannot just be that these rights are\n\u201csurely nonsense\u201d (Singer 1958, 202). For Singer, duties\nto oneself by definition entail rights against oneself, so\nthe duties should be at least as nonsensical. This is a fact\nabout ordinary talk that Singer seems unable to account for.\n\nStepping back from Singer for a moment, there does seem to be\nsomething distinctive about the realm of rights, as opposed to other\nparts of morality. Rights are waived by consent and created by\ncontracts. Rights imply authority. If you rightfully own a bicycle,\nthen when it comes to who gets to ride it, you are the boss.\n(This is especially clear on \u201cstanding theories.\u201d See\n\u00a71 above.)\n\nWe now turn to the most popular response to the paradox, which is to\nrescue obligations to oneself by airlifting them out of the realm of\nrights. We can owe things to ourselves precisely because\nowing does not imply rights or the authority to waive. Even if\nself-release is impossible, there could still be unwaivable\nobligations to oneself.\n4. Unwaivable obligations to oneself\n\nThe most popular response to the paradox is to insist that duties to\noneself exist while denying that they imply waivable rights against\noneself. This means rejecting either the first or second premise of\nSinger\u2019s argument:\n\nIf A has a duty to B, then B has a\nright against A.\nIf B has a right against A, he [or she] can give\nit up and release A from the obligation.\nNo one can release himself [or herself] from an obligation.\n\n\nEither duties don\u2019t entail rights, or rights don\u2019t always\ngrant the power of release.\n\nOne of Singer\u2019s first critics, Daniel Kading (1959), defends\nrights without release. Kading says we only have rights against people\nwith whom we have struck some kind of agreement \u2013 like a promise\nor contract \u2013 and sometimes, these people aren\u2019t around to\nrelease us. They might, for example, be dead. There is no hope of\nrelease in such a scenario, and yet the right remains. But even if\nthis correct, it won\u2019t do anything to establish duties to\noneself (as Kading seems to admit). There is something fishy about the\nidea of \u201cagreements\u201d with oneself, and, as Mu\u00f1oz\n(2020, 694) points out, the deathbed promise has no one-person\nanalogue. (See Singer 1963, 133\u201335, for further objections.)\n\nKading next tries a different maneuver, which has become a classic. He\ndistinguishes two kinds of \u201cobligations-to.\u201d One typically\nsprings from promises and contracts (the\n\u201cagreement-sense\u201d), and the other has to do with affecting\npeople\u2019s interests (the \u201cbenefits-sense\u201d). Kading\nagrees with Singer that we can\u2019t have obligations to ourselves\nin the first way, but insists that we can in the second. We are\n\u201cmorally obligated\u201d to \u201cmaximize goodness\u201d\neven when that just means making ourselves happy (Kading 1959,\n156).\n\nThis same move shows up all over, particularly in the work of Kantian\nethicists, who draw not on Kading but on Kant\u2019s distinction\nbetween \u201cjuridical\u201d and \u201cnon-juridical\u201d duties\n(see MM 6:383, LE 29:117, 632). Juridical duties are\nexternal, concerning acts rather than motives, and\nenforceable by coercion and demands. For example, if you\nthreaten not to pay me the money you contractually owe me, I can\ndemand that you fork over the cash, and I can sue you if you\ndon\u2019t. But I can\u2019t demand that you pay me out of the love\nof your heart. I can demand only the external act \u2013 the\nforking-over. A non-juridical duty, by contrast, requires the right\nmindset as well as the right action. Non-juridical duty is, basically,\na matter of caring about important things for the right reasons\n\u2013 for example, loving and respecting your neighbors because they\nmatter. Now the key point. For Kant, only juridical duties\ninvolve powers of release. If I offer to void the contract, you can\nget out of your duty to pay me. But there is no way to get release\nfrom your duty to love your neighbors because they matter \u2013 it\nis not as if your neighbors can stop mattering at will! (See\nMM 6:219.)\n\nSo here is the Kantian move. We say Singer is right about\njuridical duties, which really do come with rights and powers\nof release. There is no such thing as a juridical duty to oneself. But\nwe insist there can still be non-juridical duties to oneself,\nsince these do not imply rights and powers of release.\n\nThis move is extremely popular, though not everyone uses the term\n\u201cjuridical.\u201d Wick (1960, 1961) and Knight (1961)\ndistinguish legal from non-legal duties (see also Mothersill\u2019s\n1960 reply to Wick, which emphasizes that Wick doesn\u2019t defend\n\u201cduties\u201d to self in the ordinary sense). Eisenberg (1968)\ndiscusses \u201csocial contractual\u201d duties. Paton (1990,\n225\u201326) defends \u201cnon-contractual\u201d duties to oneself.\nHills (2005) rejects the \u201c\u2018juridical\u2019 model\u201d\nof duties and defends an unwaivable, non-juridical duty to promote\none\u2019s own well-being. Kahn, in 2018, argues that Kant himself\nshould have endorsed a duty to promote one\u2019s own\nhappiness, despite his arguments to the contrary. For a bit more\ndiscussion on what Kant thinks we owe to ourselves, see the\nsupplementary document:\n\nKant on What We Owe to Ourselves\n\n\nThe result is a certain humanistic, rather than legalistic, picture of\nduties to oneself: they do not have to do with rights and agreements,\nbut instead with caring and valuing; they are not under voluntary\ncontrol, but instead spring from unchangeable features of our\npersonality, like our capacity to make free choices (in Kant\u2019s\ncase) or our susceptibility to pain (in Hills\u2019 and Kahn\u2019s)\n\u2013 basic things about our psychology that make us human. We can\nwaive our rights at will and go on with our day; we cannot so easily\ntake a break from our humanity.\n\nOn this view, there is something called a \u201cduty to\noneself\u201d that slips through the jaws of Paradox \u2013\ndefinitely a victory. But some object that the victory is hollow: the\nKantians have carved out a space for \u201cnon-juridical\u201d\nduties to oneself while totally surrendering to Singer when it comes\nto the juridical. This objection may have bite if\n\u201cduties,\u201d as ordinarily conceived, are juridical at heart.\nIt is worth asking: what kind of \u201cduty\u201d doesn\u2019t come\nwith any rights, waivers, or enforcement? Aren\u2019t these the very\nthings that make a duty distinct from a mere value or virtue? Many\nwriters \u2013 following the legal theorist Wesley Hohfeld (1913,\n1917) \u2013 would even say that A\u2019s duty to B just is\nthe flipside of B\u2019s right against A (this sort of right is also\ncalled a claim; see e.g., Gilbert 2018; Johnson 2010; Mu\u00f1oz\n2021; Thomson 1990, chap. 1). We might hesitate to go as far as\nHohfeld in equating duties with rights. Still, some might wonder what\nis left after we subtract from a duty its rights-related upshots\n(Mu\u00f1oz 2020, 693). Are non-juridical duties really duties at\nall?\n\nPaul Schofield (2015) defends something closer to an unwaivable\njuridical duty to oneself. Schofield argues that you owe it to\nyourself not to cause yourself harm in the future \u2013 as you might\nby smoking heavily in your youth and giving yourself lung cancer. You\nalso owe it to yourself not to hamstring your future choices, as in\nDerek Parfit\u2019s (1984, 327\u201328) example of the Russian\nnobleman, who arranges as a young socialist to prevent his future self\nfrom funding conservative causes. Schofield\u2019s picture is this.\nYou owe a certain action to someone when they can legitimately demand\nthat you do it. But you can also imagine demands made by yourself of\nyourself, from different perspectives within your life. When you\nsmoke, causing yourself to suffer in the future, you can look upon\nthis either from the perspective of the future sufferer or the present\nsmoker. The future smoker \u2013 that is, you from your future\nperspective \u2013 could justifiably demand less smoking from you in\nthe present, generating a duty not to smoke. Moreover, you cannot\npresently waive this duty, since you do not now occupy the right\nperspective (Schofield 2015, 17; see also Schofield 2019).\n\nThis proposal is enormously creative \u2013 a leap forward in\nphilosophical thinking about obligations to oneself. No doubt the link\nbetween duties, demands, and perspectives will play an important role\nin future work on the subject. That said, there have been some\nobjections to this form of Schofield\u2019s view. In particular, some\nworry that it makes our relation to our future selves too chilly and\nantagonistic, like our relation to a non-consenting other (Kanygina\nforthcoming; Mu\u00f1oz 2020, 694\u201395). If we cannot\nnow waive our duties not to harm ourselves in the future, it\nseems to follow that we may not impose costs on our future selves,\neven for our own greater good. This seems too stringent; there is\nnothing wrong with taking a medication that cures a severe ailment\ntoday while causing moderately bad side-effects in the future. Harming\noneself can be justified when it makes one\u2019s life better on the\nwhole. In this respect, self-harm is much like doing harm to a\nconsenting\n other.[4]\n5. Waivable obligations to oneself\n\nOur discussion so far has assumed, following Singer, Kant, and Hobbes,\nthat self-release is fishy \u2013 that one cannot wiggle out of\none\u2019s ethical duties. That is the basic reason why Singer gives\nup on duties to oneself, and it is the basic reason why Kantians\ninsist on decoupling them from waivable rights.\n\nBut what if the assumption is wrong? What if you can release\nyourself from obligations? This brings us to the third and final\nfamily of theories, those that allow waivable obligations to oneself.\nSuch theories confront the Paradox of Self-Release head on.\nSelf-release, after all, certainly seems paradoxical. How can\nwe find a way to resist Hobbes\u2019 dictum \u2013 \u201che is\nfree, that can be free when he will\u201d \u2013 and how might we\nclear the air of paradox?\n\nThe basic problem, as a reminder, is that a waivable duty to oneself\nwould not be binding, because it would not be possible to violate. One\ncould simply waive the duty \u201cwhen one pleaseth\u201d to avoid\ntransgression, as Hobbes\u2019 sovereign might suspend your property\nrights when he wants your stuff.\n\nTo meet this challenge, we need some way to show that such duties,\ndespite appearances, could actually be binding.\n\nThe trailblazer here is G.A. Cohen. He imagines himself in the\nsovereign\u2019s predicament, passing a law that he might later want\nto waive away:\n\nSuppose\u2026that the law is indeed universal, or that it includes\nme within its scope by virtue of some other semantic or pragmatic\nfeature of it. Then, if I had the authority to legislate it, it indeed\nbinds me, as long as I do not repeal it. (1996, 170)\n\n\nIn other words, even if you can be free at will, that\ndoesn\u2019t mean you are free already. You are free when,\nand only when, you go through the motions to free yourself. Until then\nyou are bound \u2013 in this case, by virtue of your power to make\nlaws that apply to you.\n\nCohen\u2019s remarks on the subject, though valuable, are brief.\nMu\u00f1oz (2020, 2021) develops the idea into a bigger picture of\nduties, rights, and waivers. The starting point is a view known as the\nSelf-Other Symmetry: you have the same basic rights against yourself\nas you have against anybody else. But it is uniquely difficult to\nviolate your own rights, Mu\u00f1oz says, because the very choice to\ndo what they forbid doubles as an authorization to do it. By choosing\nto bop yourself on the head, for example, you make yourself into a\nwilling party to the bopping, and thereby waive your right, a bit like\nif you had consenting to being bopped by someone else. The result is\nthat rights against oneself are real but \u201cfinkish\u201d \u2013\nwaived by the very things that normally lead to violations. (The\nanalogy is with finkish dispositions, which are real but hidden by the\nvery things that normally cause them to manifest; imagine a fragile\nglass that turns to stone whenever something is about to strike it\n(see Lewis 1997; Martin 1994).)\n\nBut if a right is finkish, it is hard to see why it should matter. For\nall intents and purposes, it is as good as absent. This challenge is\npressed forcefully by Schofield:\n\nTraditionally understood, a duty binds a person, irrespective of what\nshe herself decides. The powerlessness to escape it through a mere act\nof will is, in fact, part of what it is to be duty-bound. So insofar\nas a person has the power to release herself, the purported duty lacks\nits characteristic ability to place her in the very condition that we\nassociate with duty. (2021, 47)\n\n\nAnd while some might say finkish rights and duties are merely\n\u201cfeeble,\u201d rather than impossible, Schofield (2021, 48)\nreplies that he can see \u201cno reason why we cannot simply deny\naltogether that they are duties.\u201d Finkish duties\n\u201cbind\u201d only in the sense that they count as duties; they\ndo not constrain our actions. (But see \u00a76.2 below on rights\nagainst oneself as prerogatives.)\n\nCould a waivable duty to oneself have any normative bite, anything to\nconstrain how we may act? For there to be a constraint here, waivers\nwould have to be less than automatic, so that the mere choice to bop\nmyself on the head might not waive my duty not to bop myself.\n\nSchaab (2021) argues that a decision might fail to waive a duty to\noneself if the duty and motive come from different perspectives within\nthe agent \u2013 as when someone qua philosopher decides to\nskip the gym to work on a paper even though, qua athlete,\nthey could legitimately demand more exercise. Kanygina (forthcoming)\nargues that self-release must be autonomous. If my decisions\nare \u201cakratic, negligent, or confused,\u201d they will not\nvalidly waive my duties to myself, and while sometimes my state of\nmind will double as an excuse, at other times I may be genuinely\nculpable. Kanygina illustrates with a case:\n\nLinda, a diabetic craving a cake, might tell herself \u2018What harm\nis there in my eating a piece or two?\u2019 Linda is aware of the\nrisks. Being both weak-willed and negligent of her health, she acts\nfrivolously. When she later feels guilty, her guilt seems appropriate.\n(forthcoming, \u00a73.1)\n\n\nIndeed, any version of the Self-Other Symmetry will be committed to a\nversion of Kanygina\u2019s view. It is a truism that interpersonal\nconsent can waive rights only when it is informed, voluntary, and\ncompetent. A breezy \u201cyes\u201d might not cut it. Given\nSymmetry, the same should hold in the one-person case. To authorize\noneself to act in high-stakes cases \u2013 sharing private\ninformation, donating a spare kidney, devoting one\u2019s efforts to\na cause \u2013 the decision must be made carefully in light of the\navailable facts. Even if self-release is possible, that doesn\u2019t\nmean it\u2019s easy.\n6. Applications\n\nIn modern moral philosophy, duties to oneself are often treated as an\nisolated, antiquated topic. Paul Schofield (2021, 6) remarks that\n\u201cself-directed duties find themselves largely absent from the\ncontemporary philosophical scene,\u201d as attested by the fact that\n\u2013 as of the time of his writing \u2013 there was \u201cno\nstandalone entry for duties to self\u201d in the Stanford\nEncyclopedia of Philosophy.\n\nAs readers of this entry will note, such lacunas in the literature are\nfilling up fast. More and more links are being uncovered between\nduties to self and far-flung moral questions \u2013 how we should use\nour smartphones (Aylsworth and Castro 2021); whether to let companies\nmine our data (Allen 2013); whether we should \u201csuck it up\u201d\nin the face of injustice or instead go out and protest (Boxill 1976;\nHill, Jr 1991d; Straumanis 1984).\n\nHere we will survey some particularly interesting issues that\nintersect with obligations to oneself.\n6.1 Suicide\n\nThe topic of suicide \u2013 as studied by moral and political\nphilosophers \u2013 is complex and multifaceted. (See the entry on\n suicide.)\n People have many different things to live for, as well as\ntribulations to escape from. In dark moments it may well seem\nreasonable to wish for a release from suffering; other times, the\nattempt to end one\u2019s own life may strike others \u2013 and\noneself, if one survives \u2013 as rash and tragic. One extreme case\nwould be martyrs, praised for giving their lives to a higher cause. At\nthe other end might be those who, at least on some views, have a very\nclear duty to stay alive. Even in such cases, however, it may be inapt\nor counterproductive to castigate someone for actions taken out of\ndistraught desperation, abandoned by their sense of self-worth; to\ndefend a duty of self-care here is not simply to advocate blaming and\nshaming.\n\nThere are also many people to whom one might owe the duty not to kill\noneself, as Kant observes:\n\n[Suicide] can\u2026be regarded as a violation of one\u2019s duty to\nother people (the duty of spouses to each other, of parents to their\nchildren, of a subject to his superior or to his fellow citizens, and\nfinally even a violation of duty to God, as his abandoning the post\nassigned him in the world without having been called away from it).\n(MM 6:422)\n\n\nOur question, however, must be separated out from that of duties to\nothers, from blame, and from the rationality of choosing death. The\nquestion is whether we owe it to ourselves not to\nprematurely end our lives. To get a clear look, it helps to focus on\nthe effects of suicide on the individual, not their spouse and dog and\nso on; and it may be helpful to consider both the case where one has a\nbright future and the case of foreseen grimness.\n\nSince ancient Greece, philosophers have been skeptical of a duty to\noneself not to commit suicide, however bright one\u2019s future.\nAristotle (1138a 4\u20131138b 11) argues that suicide cannot in\nprinciple be an injustice against oneself \u2013 where\n\u201cinjustice\u201d roughly means a violation of rights \u2013\nbecause the suicidal person \u201csuffers voluntarily,\u201d and\n\u201cnobody suffers injustice voluntarily.\u201d This last claim,\nclearly, is too strong. People might freely choose to suffer injustice\nwhen prevention is costly, as when someone declines to invest in an\nelaborate home security system. Other times the alternative involves\neven graver injustice; voting for \u201cthe lesser of two\nevils\u201d is still voluntary even if one wishes for a better slate\nof candidates. Still, there is something to Aristotle\u2019s point.\nHe is foreshadowing the Paradox of Self-Release. If the suicidal\nperson willingly opts to die, how could their choice possibly\ninfringe their own duties? Wouldn\u2019t those duties count as fully\nwaived?\n\nThis line of thought directly leads to a libertarian view of suicide:\nyour life, your choice \u2013 at least, when it comes to what you owe\nyourself. (See, e.g., Szasz 2002.) This is the sort of view that\nSinger and other skeptics hold across the board.\n\nA well-known challenge to such laissez-faire views comes from David\nVelleman, who argues in a Kantian spirit that those who defend the\n\u201cright to die\u201d are missing something important: \u201cthe\nsense of a value in us that makes a claim on us \u2013 a value that\nwe must live up to\u201d (1999, 612). Velleman here is\nreferring to our value as persons, a value that should be cherished as\nan end in itself rather than exploited as a mere means to a good time.\nFrances Kamm (1997) would reply that, when people have good reasons\nfor choosing death \u2013 as when their life is consumed by\n\u201cunbearable pain\u201d \u2013 they should be free to\n\u201cdecline the honor of being a person.\u201d\n\nMore recently, Schofield (2021, 137\u201338) argues that Velleman\ndoes not go far enough in recognizing obligations to oneself.\nOne\u2019s own value is not something \u201cthat just happens to\nreside within a person,\u201d but instead, one stands in a\n\u201cspecial relationship\u201d to any affront to that value. To\nput it another way, Velleman defends a self-regarding\nobligation not to commit suicide, but no such obligation to\noneself. Hill similarly doesn\u2019t go so far as to call suicide a\nviolation of duty, much less of rights, though he thinks it may in\nsome cases express a lack of proper value for one\u2019s own humanity\n(Hill, Jr 1991b). (By contrast, Mu\u00f1oz (2020, 695) thinks we owe\nit to everyone not to pointlessly, tragically kill them \u2013 self\nincluded \u2013 and that this obligation is \u201ctoo\nimportant\u201d to waive for trivial reasons; for a similar claim see\nSchofield 2021, 68n7.)\n\nHow should we think about the possibility of an obligation to oneself\nnot to commit suicide? On Schofield\u2019s framework, the key\nquestion is that of what we can legitimately demand of ourselves from\ndifferent possible perspectives. From the perspective of yourself in\nthe future, when you will be feeling the brunt of your decisions in\nthe present, you may find yourself with good reasons for resenting\nyour past choices \u2013 frittered savings, thoughtless smoking, and\nso on. From that perspective you could legitimately demand of\nyourself, in your present perspective, that you take care better care\nof your future interests. If so, Schofield thinks, you owe that care\nto yourself.\n\nIt is not altogether obvious, however, how this is supposed to work\nwhen the harm involves death. If you end your life, your future\nperspective never exists. There will be no actual perspective from\nwhich you can imagine issuing a legitimate demand. (You can conjure up\nthe perspective in your imagination, but that is not the same thing.)\nFor this reason, it may be misleading to say, as C\u00edbik (2020,\n196) does, that \u201cthe victim\u201d of a suicide is one\u2019s\n\u201cfuture self.\u201d The future self is not adversely\naffected; they are never even effected. (For a\nhighly original and illuminating discussion, see Kanygina forthcoming,\n\u00a72.)\n\nSo much for the case of missing out on a valuable future. What if your\nfuture looks bleak, and there\u2019s no way to fix it \u2013 only to\navoid it? Schofield considers such cases in an open-minded way.\n\nImagine a person who knows she will soon lose control of her rational\ncapacities, her ability to reason, her ability to understand things as\nthey are, and so on. Imagine that this is because her capacities\ndegrade, or because her pain will be so overwhelming that reason is\nimpossible. In such a case, we might wonder whether the rational\nstandpoint demands at all that one refrain from self-termination. And\nif it does, one might wonder why one would not be able to waive the\ndemand. (2021, 138)\n\n\nHere Schofield\u2019s emphasis is on the individual\u2019s interests\nand standing, not the raw moral value of her rationality. The image is\nnot that of a guardian assigned to a post, but of a person with some\nauthority to make decisions about her own life.\n6.2 Supererogation\n\nA supererogatory action is a \u201cgood deed beyond the call of\nduty\u201d (see the entry on\n supererogation).\n More precisely, it is a permissible action that is better than a\npermissible alternative. Think of friendly favors, saintly sacrifices,\nand heroic rescues.\n\nNowadays, there is not much work on the link between supererogation\nand duties to self. The standard view since the late 1970s is that\nsupererogation emerges from a clash between the greater good of others\nand raw self-interest \u2013 where self-interest is seen as a\nreasonable thing to pursue, but not as a moral obligation to oneself\n(Archer 2016a; Hurka and Shubert 2012; Parfit 1978; Scheffler 1994;\nSlote\n 1984).[5]\n\nBut in earlier work, many writers see obligations to self as\nfundamental to understanding supererogation \u2013 especially\nself-sacrifice. Jack Meiland argues that one doesn\u2019t have to\nheroically dive into the choppy waters to save others from drowning,\nthanks to a duty to oneself not to do harm; he later remarks that this\nparadox \u2013 a duty not to be a hero? \u2013\ncalls for a \u201cthorough reexamination\u201d of our views of\nsupererogation (Meiland 1964, 171). In response to Pybus (1982, 199),\nwho argues for a moral requirement to \u201cbe heroic,\u201d\nMcGoldrick objects that\n\nsuch a requirement would come into conflict with our obvious duty to\nrecognize our own intrinsic worth, and judge our own aspirations,\ngoals, and interests as no less endowed with value than the\naspirations and interests of others. (1984, 527)\n\n\n\u201cThe heart of the matter,\u201d as she puts it, \u201cis the\nKantian argument that we have duties to ourselves as well as\nothers\u201d (McGoldrick 1984, 527). Kant himself says \u201cour\nesteem\u201d for daring acts \u2013 like trying to \u201crescue\npeople from a shipwreck\u201d \u2013 will be \u201cgreatly weakened\nby the concept of duty to himself\u201d (CPrR\n5:158). The problem for Kant\u2019s view, as well as Meiland\u2019s,\nis that it seems to underrate self-sacrifice. If we owe it to\nourselves not to be the hero, won\u2019t heroism be morally\nwrong? This is an instance of the \u201cWrongness\nProblem\u201d for theories of supererogation \u2013 the problem of\nshowing why deeds that seem \u201cbeyond the call\u201d aren\u2019t\nwrong. This is the shadowy twin of the familiar \u201cObligation\nProblem,\u201d which is to explain why they aren\u2019t obligatory.\n(For early versions of the Wrongness Problem, see Mavrodes 1964 and\nNarveson 1964; see also Postow 2005).\n\nIn light of the Wrongness Problem \u2013 and with Singer\u2019s\nparadox still looming overhead \u2013 it is no surprise that some\nphilosophers began searching for something new, beyond obligations to\noneself, to be the source of the limits on moral obligations. Others\nwould give up the hunt altogether, as does Bernard Williams, a famous\nskeptic about \u201cthe morality system\u201d in general. Williams\ncalls duties to self \u201cfraudulent items,\u201d conjured up by\nphilosophers suckered in by the belief that \u201conly an obligation\ncan beat an obligation\u201d (Williams 1985, 182).\n\nNot everyone has been deterred. Some heterodox writers, working\noutside of the Kantian tradition, continue searching for a way to\nground supererogation in obligations to oneself. A notable example is\nShelly Kagan (1989, 206\u201316) and his pioneering\n\u201cSelf-Constraint Argument.\u201d Suppose \u2013 a big\n\u201csuppose\u201d \u2013 that you have the same waivable\nobligations to yourself as you do to others. Let\u2019s consider one\nsuch right; the right against yourself not to do yourself harm. From\nthis, we try to show that harming yourself for the greater good of\nothers \u2013 for example, by giving a spare kidney \u2013 will be\npurely optional. It is permissible to make the sacrifice because you\ncan just waive your obligation; the act would then be like performing\na kidney transplant on a willing donor. It is permissible not\nto self-sacrifice because you can just refuse to waive your\nobligation, which makes it wrong to self-harm; the act would then be\nlike stealing a kidney from an unwilling \u201cdonor.\u201d\nThe result is that giving your spare kidney is optional even if\nit\u2019s for the greater good: you can give yourself consent to do\nit, or refuse consent and rightfully keep the kidney. Kagan ultimately\nrejects this argument for a panoply of reasons. The other key proposal\nis due to Paul Hurley (1995), who derives the optionality of self-harm\nfrom \u201cpatient-protecting reasons,\u201d which are like\nunwaivable obligations \u2013 in this case, obligations to oneself.\nThese reasons open a \u201cprotected sphere\u201d of actions.\nMu\u00f1oz (2021) objects that Hurley\u2019s and Kagan\u2019s\narguments both struggle with the Wrongness Problem. For Hurley, the\nproblem is that a patient-protecting reason not to harm\nyourself would make it wrong to give your kidney. For Kagan, the\nsame appears to follow if you decline to\n\u201cself-consent.\u201d\n\nDespite these challenges, philosophers are still searching for links\nbetween duties to self and supererogation. Mu\u00f1oz (2021), for\nexample, tries to revive Kagan\u2019s argument, arguing that a\nwaivable duty to oneself is a prerogative: it can be cited in defense\nof one\u2019s actions, but since it can be waived at will, it\nisn\u2019t a \u201cbinding\u201d reason to comply. On this view,\nduties to self help to unify the two main concepts in deontological\nethics: restrictions, which make it wrong to harm non-consenting\nothers even for the greater good, and prerogatives, which permit us\nnot to self-harm. Restrictions come from what we owe to others, and\nprerogatives come from what we owe to ourselves.\n6.3 Self-promises\n\nSuppose it\u2019s New Year\u2019s Day, and you \u2013 sick of your\nown bad habits \u2013 decide to make a change. You say to yourself:\n\u201cI promise to cut down on screen time this year.\u201d Do you\nnow owe it to yourself to follow through? Does your resolution even\ncount as a bona fide promise?\n\nThe possibility of self-promises \u2013 and their possible import\n\u2013 has drawn the attention a number of philosophers. Some are\nskeptical (e.g., Downie 1985); others, less so (Fruh 2014; Habib 2009;\nHill, Jr 1991a; Raz 1972, 97; Rosati 2011).\n\nOn the one hand, promises to oneself can seem not just possible but\ndownright useful. When we struggle to commit our wills in the ordinary\nways \u2013 focusing on attractive aspects, \u201cpsyching ourselves\nup\u201d \u2013 we often reach for other devices of commitment\n(Schelling 1985). A promise to oneself may be just such a device. By\nsaying things like \u201cI promise to cut down on screen\ntime,\u201d we are not saying, \u201cBoy, I\u2019d better\ncut down,\u201d or \u201cGee, wouldn\u2019t it be nice if\nI cut down?\u201d We are moralizing. We are staking our self-respect\non a decision in order to get ourselves to carry it out (see Hill, Jr\n1991a), or as Rosati (2011, 143\u201344) puts it, we try to\n\u201cmaintain our self-governance\u2026by putting our authority on\nthe line\u201d \u2013 that is, our authority over ourselves, our\nauthority to \u201ceffectively determine what we shall do, and to\ncommand respect in virtue of that very authority.\u201d It is like\nvowing \u201con my honor.\u201d It is a distinctive means of\nself-motivation.\n\nOn the other hand, promises to oneself do have a funny smell. If you\npromise me something, I have the power to release you. If you promise\nyourself, then it seems you can release yourself at\nwill, which sounds paradoxical \u2013 and familiar. In Singer\u2019s\nview, this is just a special instance of the Paradox of Self-Release,\nwhich afflicts any kind of duty to oneself. He asks:\n\nCan one promise oneself to do something? Such language is frequently\nused. People say \u201cI have promised myself to\u2026\u201d But a\npromise to oneself would be a promise from which one could release\noneself at will, and thus not a genuine promise at all. (1958, 203)\n\n\nOthers have raised similar worries. Atiyah writes:\n\nIt is very odd to regard a secret vow to oneself as creating an\nobligation of any kind. If it does, [it] is one without a\ncorresponding right \u2026 [and] which can be violated without risk\nof legal, moral or social censure. (1981, 54)\n\n\nHere Atiyah echoes Singer\u2019s skepticism about duties without\nrights, as well as raising other worries.\n\nA \u201cpromise to oneself,\u201d Singer concludes, can only be a\nresolution in disguise. A genuine promise generates a duty, owed by\nthe promisor to the promisee. A self-promise, however, just expresses\na \u201csettled determination\u201d to act. It is a figurative use\nof moral language, or else it is nonsense.\n\nBut as we have seen, there are replies to the Paradox of Self-Release,\nand so it should come as no surprise that there are arguments in favor\nof genuine self-promises \u2013 which may not be as funny as they\nseemed at first whiff.\n\nTo start, self-promising is not some strange contortion only performed\nby characters in thought experiments. As Rosati (2011, 124\u201325)\nobserves, we at least seem to make self-promises about a \u201cbroad\narray\u201d of things \u2013 self-care, self-respect, moral\nrectitude, choice of lifestyle \u2013 and in a wide variety of ways,\nfrom silent vows to showy announcements. Self-promising is, in a word,\nnormal. But this by itself is not a decisive point, as Rosati\nherself would agree, since Singer could reinterpret our ordinary talk\nof self-promises as merely figurative, a way of steeling one\u2019s\nwill rather than conjuring a moral obligation.\n\nSecond, we might return to Allen\u2019s reply to Singer: we\nshouldn\u2019t be so quick to dismiss ordinary talk. Why think that\nself-promises must be figures of speech?\n\nThird, we could try to find special cases where Singer\u2019s\nskepticism is harder to believe. Allen Habib (2009) gives the example\nof a contest in which a sales manager promises her team \u2013 self\nincluded \u2013 that she will give $100 to next week\u2019s top\nseller; another of his examples is a drinker who backslides on a\nself-promise to go sober. Hill (1991a, 147) explores cases where a\npromise to oneself must be reconsidered \u201cin the light of\nunanticipated new information\u201d that tells in favor of annulment\n\u2013 on Hill\u2019s view, this kind of release is not problematic,\nbecause it is not done willy-nilly. Janis Schaab presents a similar\ncase:\n\nSuppose that I want to buy a new laptop, and so I promise myself to\nsave some money. A few days later, I am informed that my salary will\nbe raised. I can now afford to buy the new laptop rightaway\n[sic]. It seems that now, if not before, I can release myself\nfrom my promise to save money. It is not obvious that the mere\npossibility of self-release nullifies my obligation to save\nmoney. (2021, 177)\n\n\nFinally, we might defend the coherence of willy-nilly waivers.\nCertainly this is a bit easier if we already believe in the\npossibility of releasing oneself from other duties to self, like the\nduty not to harm (see \u00a75, above). The trick is the same either\nway: we say that the person is bound until the moment of\nrelease. The pioneer of this move in the promising literature is\nConnie Rosati, who writes:\n\nWe would not be tempted to say that because the promisee can release\nthe promisor at will, the promisor is not really obligated. So long as\nthe promisee has not released the promisor, she is indeed bound. But\nthen we should say the same thing about self-promises: although an\nagent, as promisee, can release herself, as promisor, at will, so\nlong as she does not release herself, she is indeed bound. (2011,\n134\u201335; see also Mu\u00f1oz 2020, 697)\n\nThis view raises its own puzzle, analogous to Schofield\u2019s\nchallenge to Mu\u00f1oz (see again \u00a75). If a self-promise can\nbe waived at will, so that there is no real danger of violating it,\nwhy should it matter?\n\nOne possible answer is the one we started with: self-promising is a\nway of staking our respect to add some moral oomph to an\nintention. This still leaves us wondering where the oomph\ncomes from, if not the threat of a broken promise. Here the friends of\nself-promising need to find some way that release might be non-trivial\neven if it is possible \u2013 just as Kanygina (forthcoming) argues\nthat self-release requires us to make decisions autonomously, and\nSchaab (2021) argues that the power of self-release does not fully\nprotect us against the possibility of violation. Fruh (2014, 170) goes\nsome way towards an answer; he argues that, just because one\ncan dissolve an obligation easily, that doesn\u2019t make\nthe act morally meaningless; the dissolution might express\nsomething undesirable, such as a deficiency of \u201cmoral\nfiber.\u201d A lack of fiber probably won\u2019t strike fear into\nevildoers\u2019 hearts. But it is a defect nonetheless.\n6.4 Body modification and self-expression\n\n\u201cYour body is a temple,\u201d the saying goes. A temple to\nwhom? If it\u2019s yours, then clearly you should\nget to decide the rules \u2013 haircuts, tattoos, piercings, sex\nhormones, giving and taking blood. All else equal, no one can tell you\nwhat to do with your body. But if it\u2019s a temple to someone\nelse \u2013 say, God \u2013 then the choice is not really\nyours to make. You\u2019re the custodian, not the caller of shots,\nand you should treat your body with the same kind of gingerly respect\nthat you would show as a guest in someone else\u2019s home. Their\ntemple, their rules.\n\nNowadays, few Western ethicists would argue that you should treat your\nbody in such-and-such a way purely because of divine authority\n(\u201cGod abhors tattoos!\u201d) or natural teleology (\u201cYour\nblood belongs in your own body!\u201d). But the history of\nphilosophy teems with prim pronouncements on the proper way to treat\none\u2019s body, and philosophers continue to debate whether certain\nkinds of bodily modification are immoral as a matter of duty to\noneself, as well as whether certain kinds of self-enhancement are\npermissible or even obligatory.\n\n\u201cBody modification,\u201d in this context, means a change to\none\u2019s body that needn\u2019t be intrinsically harmful, all\nthings considered. We are interested in the modifying itself, not just\nin the obvious harms it might involve. Decapitation\n\u201cmodifies\u201d the body, but has little in common, morally\nspeaking, with nail-clipping, haircuts, pierced ears, and the removal\nof teeth.\n\nOn Kant\u2019s view, however, decapitation and tooth-removal seem to\ndiffer only by a matter of degree. He writes:\n\nTo deprive oneself of an integral part or organ (to maim oneself)\n\u2013 for example, to give away or sell a tooth to be transplanted\ninto another\u2019s mouth, or to have oneself castrated in order to\nget an easier livelihood as a singer, and so forth \u2013 are ways of\npartially murdering oneself. (MM 6:423)\n\n\nClearly, Kant has in mind an unwaivable duty not to take out\none\u2019s body parts. Donating or selling a tooth is immoral \u2013\neven, apparently, when the transaction is consensual and mutually\nbeneficial. Kant then qualifies:\n\nBut to have a dead or diseased organ amputated when it endangers\none\u2019s life, or to have something cut off that is a part but not\nan organ of the body, for example, one\u2019s hair, cannot be counted\nas a crime against one\u2019s own person \u2013 although cutting\none\u2019s hair in order to sell it is not altogether free from\nblame. (MM 6:423)\n\n\nFor Kant, an appendectomy isn\u2019t partial murder, but there is\nsomething wrong with haircuts for paychecks. It is hard to see this as\nanything but natural teleology: it is not up to you what your\norgans are meant to do, and you may not make unnatural changes to your\nbody except to correct for defects \u2013 a version of \u201cyour\nbody is a temple,\u201d where the holiness comes from the value of\nbeing a person: \u201cdisposing of oneself as a mere means to some\ndiscretionary end is debasing humanity in one\u2019s person (homo\nnoumenon), to which the human being (homo phaenomenon)\nwas nevertheless entrusted for preservation\u201d (MM\n6:423). Here Kant sounds less like an Enlightenment thinker and more\nlike a natural lawyer (see, e.g., the discussion of self-love and\nsuicide in St. Thomas Aquinas\u2019s Summa Theologica, part\nII, Q64, A5, as cited in Cholbi 2017, sec. 2.2).\n\nSuffice it to say, Kant\u2019s view has problems. First, it\ndoesn\u2019t take bodily autonomy seriously. If you like spa days\nmore than long hair, why shouldn\u2019t you get to sell your hair and\ntreat yourself to a getaway? Second, the view doesn\u2019t generalize\nvery well. If it\u2019s wrong to sell one\u2019s body parts,\nshouldn\u2019t it also be wrong to sell one\u2019s labor,\nsince labor involves moving and using one\u2019s body, sometimes in\nunnatural ways? (Think of the nurse who takes caffeine pills to work\nthe night shift in a pandemic.) Finally, we might wonder why the\nprofit motive should be uniquely dubious. It\u2019s fine to cut\none\u2019s hair because one likes the look \u2013 why is this any\nnobler than trying to make a buck?\n\nA more promising prohibition can be found in Matej\nC\u00edbik\u2019s (2020) recent work on tattoos. A tattoo typically\nexpresses something about the bearer\u2019s personality. That\u2019s\nfine, C\u00edbik thinks, if the tattoo is discreet and the risk of\nregret is negligible, as when the tattoo represents an enduring aspect\nof the bearer\u2019s identity. The problem is that tattoos may\noutlive their inspiration, staying frozen even as identities evolve.\nRemoving tattoos can be painful, expensive, or impossible.\n\nConsider C\u00edbik\u2019s example of Amy, an 18-year-old girl who\n\u201cdesperately falls in love\u201d with a trendy musician named\nJustin:\n\nAmy listens to his music all the time, he is all that she ever reads\nabout, and his face is the main decoration of her room. Now she\ndecides to go further and get a series of tattoos with his image and\nhis name on the most prominent parts of her body including her face,\nshoulders, neck and hands. With these tattoos, she will be instantly\nrecognizable as his biggest fan, signaling her deep affection towards\nher idol \u2013 something that her (present) identity is build upon\n[sic]. (2020, 202)\n\n\nC\u00edbik thinks Amy acts wrongly. Her tattoos are\n\u201cinconsiderate\u201d towards her future self and \u201ca\ndefinition of recklessness,\u201d since she is \u201cbinding\n[herself] forever to publicly exhibit devotion to a fleeting\npop-culture phenomenon\u201d (2020, 204).\n\nThis diagnosis dovetails with Schofield on obligations to oneself in\nthe future. Schofield thinks there is something dangerous about\nactions that \u201cjeopardize a person\u2019s ability to make use of\nher practical powers later in life by harming or altering her body in\nthe present\u201d (2021, 167), since it one can reasonably demand\nfrom their own future perspective that such harms not be inflicted.\nSchofield illustrates with an analogy:\n\nJust as Beast, through his superior strength, can impose his will on\nBelle by picking her up and locking her in the tower, a person is able\nto impose her present will on herself in the future by affecting her\nown body \u2013 only in this latter case, it is the way she is\ntemporally situated, and not her superior strength, that explains her\npower and her dominance. (2021, 168)\n\n\nThe thing about tattoos, and body modification in general, is that the\nact itself is not particularly harmful; what matters is the\nrestriction on future freedom. A Justin Bieber face tattoo might not\nhurt much, but it makes it a lot harder to work in sales or run for\npublic office.\n\nWe should also note some of the points that could be made in defense\nof tattoo art, and self-expression more generally. First, whenever one\n\u201cseizes the day\u201d \u2013 putting down the books to go to a\nparty, moving countries to pursue a romance \u2013 one is sacrificing\nfuture options for the sake of savoring the present. Such trade-offs\nare part of any human life worth living. Second, even if you sometimes\nowe it to yourself to keep your options open, it might matter\nhow they are closed. Consider the gay man who refuses to hide\nhis sexuality to get ahead in the office, or the black woman who wears\nher curly natural hair in interviews even though some potential\nemployers see it as \u201cunprofessional.\u201d Here self-respect\nseems to tell in favor of acting in ways that foreclose\none\u2019s options, because the closing is achieved not by\none\u2019s choice, but through others\u2019 bigoted reactions. This\nmay be closer to how some people (especially those from cultures with\ntraditional tattoos, as in Samoan culture) think of being denied a job\non the basis of body art: the problem isn\u2019t teenage\nrecklessness, but arbitrary discrimination.\n\nStill, when it comes to thoughtless, permanent changes to one\u2019s\nown appearance, C\u00edbik and Schofield are definitely on to\nsomething. What remains to be seen is how we might reconcile the value\nof spontaneous expression with a chilly concern for future freedom. A\nblanket ban on body modification is surely too strict \u2013 but that\ndoesn\u2019t mean anything goes.\n6.5 Self-knowledge\n\nNext is a topic that Kant calls \u201cthe first command of all duties\nto oneself\u201d \u2013 namely, self-knowledge. Kant is concerned\nhere not with knowing one\u2019s personality type, personal history,\nor potential talents. His concern is moral purity:\n\nThis command is know (scrutinize, fathom) yourself,\nnot in terms of your natural perfection (your fitness or unfitness for\nall sorts of discretionary or even commanded ends) but rather in terms\nof your moral perfection in relation to your duty. That is, know your\nheart \u2013 whether it is good or evil, whether the source of your\nactions is pure or impure, and what can be imputed to you as belonging\noriginally to the substance of a human being or as derived\n(acquired or developed) and belonging to your moral condition\n(MM 6:441; see also LE 27:42, 348)\n\n\nOwen Ware detects a puzzle here. How could Kant see self-knowledge as\nobligatory given his \u201copacity thesis,\u201d according to which\nour own moral perfection is unknowable to us? \u201cI cannot know,\nfor example, whether my particular actions arise from conformity with\nthe moral law or from some hidden self-interest\u201d (Ware 2009,\n673) (For a more sanguine take on the conditions for self-knowledge,\nsee Bransen 2015 on self-love.)\n\nJordan MacKenzie (2018) explores the duty to know oneself outside of\nthe Kantian framework, decoupling self-knowledge from moral progress,\nand singling out two separate reasons for seeking self-knowledge.\nSince you owe yourself respect, you need to know yourself \u2013 you\ncan\u2019t respect a complete unknown. And since you are a valuable\nentity \u2013 respectability aside \u2013 that by itself makes you\nworth getting to know. These points are notably not tailored to the\ncase of self-knowledge; they just take basic facts about\nrespect and value and turn them inward. (Readers interested in the\nduty of self-knowledge may also be interested in the duty not to\nself-deceive; see, e.g., MacKenzie forthcoming.)\n6 Self-respect\n\nThe classic treatment of self-respect is Thomas Hill\u2019s\n\u201cServility and Self-Respect,\u201d first published in 1971.\nHill argues that there is a moral problem with servile people \u2013\nby which he means those who are overly deferential, self-loathing, or\nself-abnegating. He gives three case studies: the Uncle Tom, a Black\nman who \u201cdisplays the symbols of deference to whites, and of\ncontempt to blacks;\u201d the Self-Deprecator, whose \u201csense of\nshame and self-contempt make him content to be the instrument of\nothers;\u201d and the Deferential Wife, who is \u201cutterly devoted\nto serving her husband\u201d because of her belief that \u201cthe\nproper role for a woman is to serve her family\u201d (1991c,\n4\u20135). The problem, Hill thinks, is not that these people are\nmaking anyone miserable. They might be \u201cWise enough to Love\ntheir Chains,\u201d to borrow Mary Astell\u2019s description of the\ndutiful wife (1996, 29), and those around them might enjoy the\nbenefits of their eager self-denial. For Hill, the problem is more\nintrinsic. The servile agent does not appreciate their own rights,\neither because they misunderstand them \u2013 like the wife who is\nbrainwashed into thinking that she isn\u2019t really allowed\nto say \u201cno\u201d \u2013 or else they just don\u2019t value\ntheir own rights as much as others\u2019 whims.\n\nHill\u2019s paper has sparked, or at least foreshadowed, several\ninteresting discussions. One concerns whether Hill got the cases right\n\u2013 particularly the Deferential Wife (see, e.g., Baron 1985;\nFriedman 1985; Superson 2010). Another debate centers on the duty to\nresist one\u2019s own oppression; Carol Hay (2011) argues that this\nis a duty to oneself, whereas Straumanis (1984) argues that a woman\nowes it to other women, not oneself, to enhance herself and resist her\nown oppression. Bernard Boxill (1976) asks what should happen\nafter one\u2019s rights are violated, when there is no hope\nof rectification. Should one protest, as W.E.B. Dubois (1966, 48)\nadvocates, as an expression of self-respect? Or would it be servile,\nas Booker T. Washington (1966, 514) argues, to make pleas for the\n\u201csympathy\u201d of others rather than waiting until one can fix\nthe problem by oneself? Boxill ultimately sides with Dubois,\ninsisting, like Hill, on the need to value one\u2019s own rights.\n6.7 Privacy\n\nFinally, Anita Allen (2013) argues that one\u2019s digital privacy is\nnot just a personal good but a duty to oneself. She gives examples\nwhat of this duty might entail: securing information about one\u2019s\nbank account and genome, not constantly broadcasting one\u2019s\nlocation and beliefs, not aiming \u201csexy pictures\u201d of\noneself \u201cat minors or the general public\u201d (2013, 850).\nAllen then draws implications for reform: we should not just judge\ncompanies and governments by how much they invade our\nprivacy, but also by how well they help us protect ourselves\nfrom invasive third parties (2013, 851).\n\nOn this basis, Allen advocates paternalistic privacy laws in certain\ncases, foreshadowing Schofield\u2019s case for liberal paternalism\n(2018, 2021, chaps. 5 & 6). If Allen and Schofield are right,\nobligations to oneself are not just relevant to how we treat\nourselves, but to how we should treat each other (see also Kanygina\n2020), and how we ought to live together in civil and political\nsociety.\n7. Conclusion\n\nThe question of what we owe to ourselves has, after decades in the\ndoldrums, surged back to life. So what\u2019s next? We now have a\nsense of where the action has been \u2013 the spectre of paradox, the\nsearch for unwaivable duties, the clash between self-concern and the\nneeds of others. What open questions might be the focus of the next\nbig insight, the next chapter in the story?\n\nOne question is whether duties to self are in any sense\n\u201cfoundational\u201d \u2013 either as much as or more so than\nduties to other people. The idea is associated with Kant\u2019s\nethics (see Reath 2002, sec. II). The basic idea is a moralized\nversion of RuPaul\u2019s \u201cIf you can\u2019t love yourself /\nHow in the hell you gonna love somebody else?\u201d The question,\nKantified, is that of how you could owe anything to other people if\nyou can\u2019t owe things to yourself. Margaret Gilbert\u2019s\n(2018) theory of rights also brings in rights against oneself at the\nground floor. For Gilbert, rights are the product of joint decisions,\nand they give each party to the decision a right against each that the\ndecision be carried through. That includes the right of each against\nhimself or herself. This view has the amazing consequence that,\nwhenever I violate your right against me, I also violate a right\nagainst myself \u2013 a consequence that Gilbert doesn\u2019t\nstress, but which she does accept. She even gives a partial defense at\none point, arguing that we can sensibly demand of ourselves that we\ncarry out our joint decisions with other people (2018,\n177\u201378).\n\nAnother issue is that of the \u201cSelf-Other Symmetry.\u201d If we\ndo have duties to ourselves, are they essentially similar to duties to\nothers, or fundamentally different? Most writers who take up the topic\nargue against Symmetry (Slote 1984; Stocker 1976), but some are\nsympathetic (Mu\u00f1oz 2020, 2021; Schaab 2021).\n\nA final question, shared by many writers, is whether\n\u201cobligation\u201d is the only concept that we need here. No\ndoubt, it\u2019s useful. But there is a vast and variegated range of\nthings that we do with other people that we also turn inwards in an\nintriguing way. Consider the virtues of patience, forgiveness,\ncompassion, kindness, and appreciation. It is not so obvious that the\nright theory of \u201cobligations\u201d is going to tell us how\nthese things work in general, much less in the solo case.\n\nThe deeper reason for wanting to understand self-obligation is to make\nsense of the seemingly special character of how we relate to\nourselves. To focus only on the bossiest aspects of self-relation\n\u2013 duties and demands, claims and commands \u2013 is to risk\nmissing out on the full moral richness of our inner lives.\n", "bibliography": {"categories": [], "cat_ref_text": {"ref_list": ["Allen, Anita L., 2013. \u201cAn Ethical Duty to Protect\nOne\u2019s Own Information Privacy?\u201d <em>Alabama Law\nReview</em>, 64(4): 845\u201366.", "Aquinas, St. Thomas, <em>Summa Theologica</em>, in <em>Basic\nWritings of Saint Thomas Aquinas</em>, Anton Pegis (ed.), New York:\nRandom House, 1945.", "Archer, Alfred, 2016a. \u201cMoral Obligation, Self-Interest and\nThe Transitivity Problem,\u201d <em>Utilitas</em>, 28(4):\n441\u201364.", "\u2013\u2013\u2013, 2016b. \u201cSupererogation, Sacrifice,\nand the Limits of Duty,\u201d <em>Southern Journal of\nPhilosophy</em>, 54(3): 333\u201354.", "Astell, Mary, 1996. \u201cSome Reflections Upon Marriage,\u201d\nIn <em>Astell: Political Writings</em>, Patricia Springborg (ed.),\nCambridge: Cambridge University Press.", "Aylsworth, Timothy, and Clinton Castro, 2021. \u201cIs There a\nDuty to Be a Digital Minimalist?\u201d <em>Journal of Applied\nPhilosophy</em>, 38(4): 663\u201373.", "Bacin, Stefano, 2013. \u201cThe Perfect Duty to Oneself Merely as\na Moral Being,\u201d in <em>Kant\u2019s</em>\n\u201cTugendlehre\u201d: <em>A Comprehensive Commentary</em>,\nAndreas Tampota, Oliver Sensen, and Jens Timmermann (eds.), Berlin: de\nGruyter, 245\u201368.", "Baron, Marcia, 1985. \u201cServility, Critical Deference and the\nDeferential Wife,\u201d <em>Philosophical Studies</em>, 48(3):\n393\u2013400.", "Benn, Claire, 2017. \u201cSupererogatory Spandrels,\u201d\n<em>Etica &amp; Politica / Ethics and Politics</em>, 19(1):\n269\u201390.", "Boxill, Bernard R., 1976. \u201cSelf-Respect and Protest,\u201d\n<em>Philosophy and Public Affairs</em>, 6(1): 58\u201369.", "Bransen, Jan, 2015. \u201cSelf-Knowledge and Self-Love,\u201d\n<em>Ethical Theory and Moral Practice</em>, 18(2): 309\u201321.", "Cholbi, Michael, 2015. \u201cOn Marcus Singer\u2019s \u2018On\nDuties to Oneself\u2019,\u201d <em>Ethics</em>, 125(3):\n851\u201353.", "\u2013\u2013\u2013, 2017. \u201cSuicide,\u201d <em>The\nStanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy</em> (Fall 2017 Edition), Edward\nN.
