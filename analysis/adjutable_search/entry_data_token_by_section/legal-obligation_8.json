    "main_text": "Non-Transactional Theories || Instrumental Justification\n5.1 Instrumental Justification\n\nOne influential line of argument justifies authority instrumentally,\nas a way to help its subjects do what they ought.\n\n\nThe normal and primary way to establish that a person should be\nacknowledged to have authority over another person involves showing\nthat the alleged subject is likely better to comply with reasons which\napply to him (other than the alleged authoritative directives) if he\naccepts the directives of the alleged authority as authoritatively\nbinding, and tries to follow them, than if he tries to follow the\nreasons which apply to him directly. (Raz 1994: 214; see also Raz\n1986: 38\u201369; Raz 2006)\n\n\nRaz calls this the \u201cnormal justification thesis\u201d (NJT). It\nis satisfied only if the authority bases his directives on the reasons\nwhich apply to the subjects (the \u201cdependence thesis\u201d) and\nif the subjects take his directives as \u201cexclusionary\u201d or\n\u201cpre-emptive\u201d reasons (see Section 1 above), displacing\ntheir own judgements about what is to be done on the merits (the\n\u201cpre-emption thesis\u201d). Three points need emphasis. First,\na normal justification is not a unique justification, but one typical\nto a variety of practical and theoretical authorities. At its core\nidea is that justified authorities help their subjects do what they\nalready have good reason to do; it does not apply when it is more\nimportant for the subjects to decide for themselves than to decide\ncorrectly. Second, although NJT has similarities to\nrule-utilitarianism, it is not a utilitarian theory: that requires\nfurther commitments about what sort of reasons are relevant and how\nabout indirect policies may be pursued. Third, NJT does not require\nvalid authority to promote the subject\u2019s self-interest. For\nexample, if there are investments it is immoral to make (e.g., in\ncountries that tolerate slavery) then a consultant\u2019s\nrecommendations merit deference only they steer one away from those\ninvestments: it is not enough (or permissible) for them to maximize\none\u2019s financial returns. NJT is governed by whatever reasons\ncorrectly apply to the case, not reasons of which the agent\nis aware, or which serve his self-interest narrowly understood.\n\nSomething like this does capture the way we justify deferring to\nexpert opinions of scientists or to the advice of doctors who know\nbetter than we do. Were we to try to second-guess them we could not\nprofit from their expertise. To accept them as authoritative therefore\nrequires deferring to their judgement, and allowing that to displace\nour own assessment of what is to be done. This is not blind\ndeference: the subject remains attentive to higher-order\nconsiderations that determine whether the authority is trustworthy,\nacting in good faith, and so on. And the deference may be limited in\nscope and subject to checks of its effectiveness over time.\n\nHow far do such considerations apply to political authority? The idea\nthat political authority is primarily justified by virtue of some\nvaluable service it provides to those that are subject to it certainly\nseems appealing. And the view has a broader application than we might\ninitially think, once we consider the important role that political\nauthority is normally deemed to play in creating or supporting\nvaluable schemes of social cooperation. If we have reasons to support\nsuch schemes and the NJT is correct, we may be justified in obeying\nthe authority, even though the schemes in question are not those we\nwould have chosen ourselves. The NJT is thus considered by many as\nwell placed to justify obedience in general \u201cco-ordination\nproblems\u201d and in situations in which individual reasoning might\nbe self-defeating, for instance, in prisoner dilemmas.\n\nA worry some have raised about NJT is that although able to vindicate\nthe claim that we have reason to act as the authority requires, it\nseems unable to vindicate the claim that we have an obligation to do\nso. As we have seen, authorities are normally thought to have the\nmoral power to impose obligations over us, or at least the right to\ncoerce us to act as they require. Experts, by contrast, lack such\npower. Refusing to comply with their directives, no matter how\nfoolish, doesn\u2019t give them the standing to demand compliance or\nto sanction us if we refuse. One of the main objections raised against\nNJT is that it blurs the distinction between being subject to\nsomeone\u2019s authority and merely receiving advice from an expert\n(Perry 2005; Himma 2007; Darwall 2013: chs. 8\u20139; Tadros 2020;\nbut see Raz 2010). A further objection is that Raz\u2019s view fails\nto pay sufficient attention to the procedural aspects of the\njustification for political authority. We normally think that\nit\u2019s important that the decisions of political authorities are\nthe product of fair-democratic procedures, but a purely instrumental\njustifications seems insensitive to this sort of consideration\n(Waldron 1999; Shapiro 2002; Hershovitz 2003; Christiano 2004; Viehoff\n2011).\n\nAs for its capacity to deal with coordination problems, it is\nuncertain how far deference to authority is really needed here. The\nextent to which people need authoritative guidance to secure\ncooperation varies with context, and law can solve some problems of\ncooperation simply by providing information or by restructuring\nincentives (see Green 1988: 89\u2013157). That suggests that NJT\ncovers only a narrow range of legitimate state activity. But in\nanother way, NJT seems too broad. We do not think that political\nauthority should be acknowledged whenever the rulers can\nbetter ensure conformity to right reason. There are matters that are\ntoo trivial or otherwise inappropriate for political regulation. So\nperhaps some sort of threshold condition must first be met, and NJT\nshould be confined to issues of general social importance.\n(Raz\u2019s view has had a pervasive influence in the debate,\ngenerating a vast literature. Recent works that engage with it include\nShapiro 2002; Perry 2012; Enoch 2014; Macklem 2015.)\n",
