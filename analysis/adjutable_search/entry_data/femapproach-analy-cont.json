    "main_text": "\n1. Defining Women\n\nFor feminists, the question of who or what women are has never been\neasily answered and the situation has only become more complicated\nover time. Both analytic and Continental traditions find a clear\narticulation of the problem in Simone de Beauvoir\u2019s 1949 book,\nThe Second Sex where she famously claims that \u201cOne is\nnot born, but rather becomes a woman\u201d (1953, 281). Elizabeth\nSpelman\u2019s consideration of this claim (1988) can serve as a\nstarting basis for the analytic tradition\u2019s reflections on the\nquestion of who or what women are meant to be while Judith\nButler\u2019s analysis (1990) can do the same for the Continental\ntradition.\n1.1 The Analytic Tradition\n\nThe claim that \u201cOne is not born, but rather becomes a\nwoman\u201d signals a distinction between sex, comprising physical\nand biological aspects of bodies, and gender, comprising learned\nbehaviors, attitudes and aspirations. While this distinction is\ncomplex and controversial enough (see the entry on\n feminist perspectives on sex and gender)\n Beauvoir\u2019s claim also raises what are now termed intersectional\nissues. Spelman notes that in parts of The Second Sex\nBeauvoir recognizes that if one is not born but rather becomes a\nwoman, it is not the same to become a white woman as it is to become a\nBlack one and not the same to become a bourgeois woman as it is to\nbecome a proletarian one. Indeed, Beauvoir bemoans the effect this\ndifference has for women\u2019s struggles for freedom and equality.\nWomen \u201clive dispersed among the males,\u201d she writes,\n\u201cattached through residence, housework, economic condition, and\nsocial standing to certain men \u2013 fathers or husbands \u2013\nmore firmly than they are to other women. If they belong to the\nbourgeoisie, they feel solidarity with men of that class, not with\nproletarian women; if they are white, their allegiance is to white\nmen, not to Negro women\u201d (1953, xix). Not only are women\u2019s\nallegiances bound to class and race but their classes and races can\nlead to tensions and conflicts with other women. Among other\nobservations Beauvoir makes, Spelman notes, are that bourgeois women\ncan be hostile to their working class male and female servants; that\nupper-class girls are brought up to believe in their superiority to\nworking class men and that during the American Civil War some white\nSouthern women defended slavery even more fiercely than their male\ncounterparts.\n\nIn other parts of The Second Sex, however, Beauvoir ignores\nthe consequences of intersections of gender with class and race, and\ntalks about women in general. Spelman points to her contrast between\nwomen, on the one hand, and proletarians, aborigines, Blacks and Jews,\non the other, as well as to her ascription of women\u2019s failure\nhistorically to reject their subordinate social position to the\nadvantages they gain from their alliance with \u201ca superior\ncaste.\u201d Here Beauvoir seems to forget that many women are\nproletarians, aborigines, Blacks and Jews and she writes as if all\nwomen shared the same relation to the white bourgeois men she calls\nthe \u201csuperior caste\u201d(1953, xxi). Spelman also notes the\ncontrast Beauvoir sets up between men defined as citizens and women\ndepicted as wives \u201cshut up in the home;\u201d the way she\nrefers appreciatively to August Bebel\u2019s comparison of women and\nthe proletariat in his Women under Socialism; the use she\nmakes of Hegel\u2019s discussion of the relationship between master\nand slave to describe the relationship between men and women; and her\ncomparison of \u201cNegro slavery\u201d with female slavery (Spelman\n1988, 64\u20135).\n\nBeauvoir\u2019s work thus contains a contradiction in its thinking\nabout women: Sometimes it conceives of women as a homogenous group,\nuniformly subordinate to men, and sometimes it conceives of women as\n\u201cdispersed,\u201d with different relations of solidarity with,\nand subordination to, different groups of men. Both conceptions have\nproblems. In conceiving of women as dispersed according to race and\nclass Beauvoir\u2019s work raises the question of what similarities\nin experience, interest or concern might underwrite feminist\nstruggles. Sally Haslanger calls this the commonality problem (2000,\n37). What experiences does a black Sudanese Muslim woman displaced by\nethnic cleansing in Dafur share with the late Queen of England\n(Mikkola 2007, 363)? What connects white middle-class women pursuing\nprofessional careers with, say, poorer women or women of color who may\ntake over their domestic chores (Ehrenreich 2002)? Might interests in\na living wage by female childcare workers not oppose interests of more\nprivileged women in affordable day care (Collins 1998, 223)? Moreover,\nin conceiving of women as a homogeneous group and contrasting them to\nproletarians, aborigines, Blacks and Jews Beauvoir betrays her\nidentification of women in general with a certain group of women,\nnamely those that are not proletarian, aboriginal, Black or Jewish.\nHaslanger calls this the normativity problem (2000, 37). Talk of women\nas a single group falsely generalizes the interests, characteristics\nand concerns of specific women \u2013 mainly those that are\nmiddle-class, European, white and heterosexual \u2013 and makes them\nthe norm for all.\n\nKimberl\u00e9 Crenshaw draws the consequences of this false\ngeneralization for anti-discrimination law (1989), which has the\nresources to deal with discrimination against Blacks or women but not\ndiscrimination against Black women, and for the issue of violence\nagainst Black women (1991). Civil rights groups often downplay\nstatistics about domestic violence in Black neighborhoods because they\ndo not want to feed stereotypes about the violence of Black men.\nFeminists often downplay the same statistics because they do not want\ndomestic violence to appear to be simply a crime against women of\ncolor. Black men thus serve as the norm for civil rights advocates and\nwhite women as the norm for women\u2019s rights advocates. The\npeculiar vulnerability of women of color at the intersection of racism\nand sexism disappears from view.\n\nCrenshaw\u2019s work on intersectionality underscores concerns about\nexclusion already voiced by the Combahee River Collective, founded in\n1974, as well as by writers such as bell hooks (1981, 7), A\u00edda\nHurtado (1989, 849\u201350) and the contributors to such influential\nanthologies as This Bridge Called My Back (Moraga and\nAnzaldua 1981) and All the Women Are White, All the Blacks Are\nMen, But Some of Us Are Brave: Black Women\u2019s Studies (Hull,\nScott and Smith 1982). Recognition of the myriad intersections that\ncomplicate the identity of women also continues to develop,\nencompassing intersections with not only class, race, sexuality and\nnationality but disability, cisgender and so on. (See Bettcher and\nGarry 2009; Hall 2015, Bettcher 2021 and Hypatia\u2019s\nspecial issue on decolonial feminism. 2020). Indeed, some scholars\nworry that putative intersectional analyses have wandered too far from\ntheir roots in Black feminist theory. (See Nash 2018).\n\nThose analytic feminists interested in preserving some notion of women\nas a common identity pursue various strategies. Ann Garry (2011) looks\nto a Wittgensteinian family resemblance analysis. We can give up on\nthe existence of some property, experience, or interest that all women\nshare without giving up on overlapping and crisscrossing\ncharacteristics that become clear within specific social contexts. For\nher part, Haslanger proposes an \u201cameliorative\u201d concept of\nwomen, one that can help with attempts to end sexist oppression. If\ngender cannot be defined in terms of characteristics or concerns\ncommon to members of a particular gender, she thinks it can\nnonetheless be defined \u201cin terms of how one is socially\npositioned, where this is a function of, e.g., how one is viewed, how\none is treated, and how one\u2019s life is structured socially,\nlegally, and economically.\u201d On this account, gender categories\nrepresent hierarchical relations in which one group maintains a\nsubordinate relation to another and the difference between the two\ngroups is marked by \u201csexual difference\u201d (2000, 38).\nThus:\n\nS is a woman iffdf S is\nsystematically subordinated along some dimension (economic, legal,\npolitical, social, etc.) and S is \u201cmarked\u201d as a\ntarget for this treatment by observed or imagined bodily features\npresumed to be evidence of a female\u2019s biological role in\nreproduction (2000, 39).\n\n\nHaslanger acknowledges that this definition excludes some we might\nintuitively think of as women such as women of inordinate privilege\nwhose observed or imagined bodily features do not mark them for\nsubordination. Nevertheless, she thinks that if we tailor our\ndefinition to the feminist purposes of overcoming subordination these\n\u201cwomen\u201d are not the ones who matter (2000, 46).\n\nYet Mari Mikkola claims that the confusion Haslanger\u2019s terms\nwould create by excluding many commonly defined as women \u201cis\nunlikely to help in the task of challenging existing social\nconditions\u201d (2009, 84). Worse, Katharine Jenkins (2016) thinks\nthe definition excludes some trans women and probably includes only\nthose trans women whose gender presentation is respected because they\nare perceived as possessing bodily features associated with a\nfemale\u2019s role in reproduction; consequently they are perceived\nas either cisgender or as having undergone medical interventions that\nhave altered some of their bodily features so that they now are\nunderstood as the same sort of features cis women possess (400).\nJenkins thinks Haslanger\u2019s ameliorative project can be rescued\nby considering gender not only in terms of class, as Haslanger does in\ntalking about gender, but also in terms of identity, as Haslanger does\nin talking about race, where racial identities involve navigating the\nnorms associated with them. Hence, both class as a woman and\npossession of a female gender identity need to be the focus of an\nameliorative inquiry. (415\u20136).\n\nIn a later article (which refers to Judith Butler and Monique Wittig\nand thus indicates the artificial character of any strict separation\nof analytic and Continental schools in feminist philosophy), Haslanger\nconcedes Jenkins\u2019 point. Although she reiterates that her\nconcern in her earlier essay was social function: \u201ca theoretical\nanalysis of the social factors that produced...gendered\nidentities\u201d (2020, 235) she now claims that her earlier account\nof gender did not offer an adequate replacement for identity.\n1.2 The Continental Tradition\n\nContinental feminists are often as concerned as Haslanger is with\ncommonality and normativity problems. Debra Bergoffen takes up\nBeauvoir\u2019s comparison of women and Black people in \u201cOf\nWomen and Slaves\u201d (2017) while Chandra Mohanty criticizes the\n\u201cadd and stir\u201d approach (2003, 518), which tries to\ncounter the exclusion of many women but still takes the experiences of\nwhite European heterosexual women as the base while mixing in the\nexperiences of others, say, Indonesian Nike workers, as if they were\nmere seasoning. Nor can the concerns be accommodated by taking\nIndonesian Nike workers as normative for non-Western women any more\nthan the concerns of mid-twentieth century Parisian women can be taken\nas normative for Western ones (2003, 34). Indeed, as Catherine Homan\nwrites, \u201cPursuing inclusion through the attempt to \u2018add\nwomen\u2019 or add people of color or any other traditionally\nmarginalized identity \u2018and stir\u2019 is bound to fail because\nit does not question the norms of the tradition in the first\nplace\u201d (2022).\n\nIn her 1990 and now-classic book, Gender Trouble: Feminism and the\nSubversion of Identity, Judith Butler pushes such concerns\nfurther by questioning the relation between construction and\nrepresentation. As a political movement, feminism supposes that it\nrepresents a set of pre-existing subjects, namely women, who are\nuniformly oppressed by a uniform patriarchy. Yet if we follow\nFoucault, we have to ask who these pre-existing subjects are. More\nspecifically, if we return to Beauvoir\u2019s claim that \u201cOne\nis not born, but rather becomes a women\u201d we have to ask who or\nwhat it is that becomes a woman. It is misleading to think of\noppression in terms of structures of power over against the subjects\nthat precede them because subjects, as the particular subjects they\nare, are first constituted through specific authorizations\n\u201cthrough the forms of power that regulate, control, represent\nand protect them.\u201d Hence, \u201cthe juridical formation of\nlanguage and politics that represents women as \u2018the\nsubject\u2019 of feminism is itself a discursive formation and effect\nof a given version of representational politics\u201d (1990, 2).\nWhile Beauvoir\u2019s claim assumes a pre-existing female sexed\nperson who acquires the attitudes, behaviors and aspirations of a\nfeminine gender through socialization, Butler maintains that it is\nthrough regimes of gender that we first conceive of bodies as sexed.\n\u201cGender is \u2026 the discursive/cultural means by which\n\u2018sexed nature\u2019 or \u2018a natural sex\u2019 is produced\nand established as \u2018prediscursive\u2019\u201d (1990, 7). This\ndiscursive formation of both gender and sex is not only inevitably\nexclusionary and not only \u201cthe mark imposed by the\noppressor\u201d (Wittig 1992, 11) but also inconsistent and\nincoherent both across different historical contexts (see Riley 1988)\nand in relation to race, class, sexual identities and so on.\n\nAs Butler points out, Luce Irigaray (1985) complicates matters\nfurther. Here Irigaray\u2019s reference is Beauvoir\u2019s claim\nthat a woman \u201cis defined and differentiated with reference to\nman and not he with reference to her; she is the incidental, the\ninessential as opposed to the essential. He is the Subject, he is the\nAbsolute \u2013 she is the Other\u201d (1953, 13). Beauvoir insists\nthat there is no time in history in which women were not the Other:\nmen are always the One and women are always the Other. Moreover, as\nthe Other, they live only in relation to the One and have no free\nhuman existence or subjectivity on their own. They occupy space in a\nman\u2019s world only as relative and inessential aspects of it. Yet\nIrigaray explains that if women are the Other to men they cannot be\ndefined independently of a definition of men. To define women as the\nOther of men is to articulate their identity within a vocabulary that\ntakes men as its norm. But if they cannot be defined independently of\nmen, how are they Other from them? If women can be articulated only\nwithin a male-normed language, then language cannot get at their\notherness at all. They are always, instead, part of a language system\nexpressing the One. The \u201cexclusion\u201d of women, Irigaray\nwrites, \u201cis internal to an order from which nothing escapes: the\norder of (man\u2019s) discourse. To the objection that this discourse\nis perhaps not all there is, the response will be that it is women who\nare \u2018not-all\u2019\u201d (1985, 88). Julia Kristeva agrees.\n\u201cA woman cannot be,\u201d she writes. \u201cIt is something\nwhich does not even belong in the order of being\u201d (1981, 137).\nThus, if women risk disappearing into various nodes of\nintersectionality in the analytic tradition, in the Continental they\nrisk being unable to be thought at all.\n\nIs there any way to rescue them? Butler is not wedded to the idea that\nwe need a stable conception of women. Rather, she wonders whether we\nshould entertain \u201ca radical critique that seeks to free feminist\ntheory from the necessity of having to construct a single or abiding\nground,\u201d and she asks whether \u201cthe construction of the\ncategory of women as a coherent and stable subject\u201d is \u201can\nunwitting regulation and reification of gender relations\u201d (1990,\n5).\n\nSome other feminists making use of Continental sources are unsure\nabout this conclusion. Iris Marion Young (1994) turns to Jean-Paul\nSartre\u2019s distinction between a series and a group. For Sartre, a\ngroup is a collection of people who consciously undertake a common\nproject together where the project typically is one best taken up by\nthis sort of group (1994, 724). Storming the Bastille is an example.\nIn contrast, a series is less organized and not at all self-conscious;\nhere the example is people waiting for a bus. These individuals\npossess a common interest in traveling along a certain route, but they\nhave, or need have, no direct relation to one another. This series\ncould become a group were individuals within it to start complaining\nabout the length of time they wait for the bus, and they could\nundertake together some sort of collective protest. Nonetheless,\nwithout this move toward collective action, they remain isolated from\none another and focused on the bus, which Sartre and Young call a\npractico-inert reality, rather than on each other.\n\nWomen, for Young, are a series, where one practico-inert reality is an\neffect of a compulsory heterosexuality that focuses on the features of\na body connected to sexual reproduction. Other practico-inert\nrealities include pronouns, verbal and visual representations,\nclothes, cosmetics, social spaces, and spaces associated with the\nsexual division of work and other activities. In each case, these\nrealities describe structures or objects to which individuals relate\nthemselves serially, as bus-riders relate themselves to a bus.\nConceiving of women as a series thus allows for the sense in which\nthey share certain features but in which they can also possess\nstriking differences in their relation to the realities that make them\npart of that series. Women are \u201ca serial collective defined\nneither by any common identity nor by a common set of attributes that\nall individual in the series share\u201d (1994, 737). At the same\ntime, they can always become a group through collective action.\n\nIn another broadly phenomenological attempt to rescue the common\nidentity of women, Linda Mart\u00edn Alcoff (2005) appeals to the\nphenomenology of Maurice Merleau-Ponty to anchor women\u2019s\nidentity in embodiment. Bodies and bodily experiences differ for men\nand women. These differences can stem from cultural practices that\npromote different ways of moving, siting, standing, running, speaking,\nand throwing a ball, for instance. Moreover, because of differences in\nphysical strength, men and women also approach the same task\ndifferently, using different parts of their bodies to do the same\nthings. Finally, in distinction from men, women\u2019s bodily\nexperiences include the \u201cexperience of breasts, menses,\nlactation and pregnancy\u201d (2005, 106). For Alcoff, these\ndifferences lead to differences in women\u2019s orientations or what,\nfollowing the hermeneutic philosopher Hans Georg Gadamer, she calls\nhorizons on themselves and their world. She does not deny that these\nhorizons vary according to the traditions and cultures to which\nvarious women belong; nor does she deny that horizons also vary\naccording to intersections with other factors, such as race and class.\nAt the same time, she argues, \u201cThe possibility of pregnancy,\nchildbirth, nursing, and in many societies, rape are parts of\nfemales\u2019 horizons \u2026 and they exist there because of the\nways they are embodied\u201d (2005, 176). Yet here again, the specter\nof false generalizations looms. Stephanie Julia Kapusta (2016)\nquestions Alcoff\u2019s emphasis on biological differences and\npregnancy given the way in which it can marginalize and inflict\npsychological, moral, or political harms on certain individuals,\nincluding trans people.\n\nOther hermeneutic approaches to women\u2019s identity include Georgia\nWarnke\u2019s After Identity: Rethinking Race, Sex and\nGender (2007) and Lauren Barthold\u2019s A Hermeneutic\nApproach to Gender and Other Social Identities (2016). Warnke\nclaims identities are interpretations of, or ways of understanding,\nwho we and others are. As such they necessarily comply with the\nconditions of understanding: they are culturally and historically\nsituated, motivated by particular concerns and interests and\ninevitably partial. We can thus understand people as women only in\nparticular contexts and ought not suppose their identities or\ncommonalities to extend beyond those contexts. For her part, while\nalso conceiving of women\u2019s identity in hermeneutic terms,\nBarthold questions both Alcoff\u2019s and Warnke\u2019s work. In her\nview a hermeneutic approach to identities must include an account of an\nindividual\u2019s various social identities and possibilities for\nnegotiating among them, an account of the individual\u2019s identity\nformation and an ability to assess the adequacy of particular social\nidentities in socio-political terms.\n1.3 Conclusion\n\nIn Beauvoir\u2019s work, both broadly analytic and broadly\nContinental feminist approaches find resources for raising questions\nabout who women are, how they might be defined and for what purposes.\nBoth approaches are interested in developing a definition of women\nthat is inclusive, sensitive to intersecting oppressions and useful to\nfeminist struggles. There are affinities in some of the ways theorists\nin each tradition try to accomplish these goals: for example between\nGarry\u2019s appeal to family resemblances and Young\u2019s appeal\nto series that can become groups. Critics within each tradition also\noverlap in questioning the exclusions that the proffered definitions\ninvolve.\n2. Freedom and Domination\n\nWith regard to questions of freedom and domination, the distinction\nbetween Continental feminists in the (French) post-structuralist\ntradition and those in the (German) tradition of critical theory is\nperhaps more pronounced than that between the latter and those in the\nanalytic tradition.\n2.1 The Continental Tradition\n\nButler begins her analysis in Gender Trouble (1990) by\nreturning to Irigaray and Kristeva\u2019s criticism of Beauvoir and\narguing that their insights into the closed nature of a gendered\nlinguistic system raise issues about a substance-accident metaphysics\nas a whole. According to this metaphysics, both sex and gender are\nmeant to be accidental attributes attached to a substantial subject.\nOne is essentially a subject and only accidentally a male or female,\nmasculine or feminine one. Yet, if women can be defined only in terms\nof men, as the Other of men, then sex and gender are not as much\naccidents as they are relations \u2013 not attributes a subject\npossesses but oppositions between linguistic terms: male versus female\nand masculine versus feminine. Furthermore, if sex and gender are not\nattributes, perhaps we should rethink the subject or substance to\nwhich they are meant to attach. Perhaps there is only language which,\nin articulating a relation between male and female, masculine and\nfeminine, posits a substance on which to erect those terms. Butler\nquotes Michel Haar\u2019s commentary on Nietzsche:\n\nAll psychological categories (the ego, the individual, the person)\nderive from the illusion of substantial identity. But this illusion\ngoes back basically to a superstition that deceives not only common\nsense but also philosophers \u2013 namely, the belief in language\nand, more precisely, in the truth of grammatical categories (1977,\n17\u20138).\n\n\nIn other words, language inspires us to add substantial identities to\nactions because verbs need subjects. Turning from Nietzsche to J.L.\nAustin, Butler conceives of women (and men) as\n\u201cperformatives.\u201d Performative speech acts for Austin are\nutterances such as \u201cthe meeting is now open\u201d or \u201cI\nnow pronounce you husband and wife\u201d in which, uttered under\nappropriate circumstances, the speech act does something by saying\nsomething. The speech act thus brings a state of affairs into\nexistence. Likewise, according to Butler, the language of sex and\ngender, appropriately institutionalized, creates men and women.\n\nWhat is meant by appropriately institutionalized? For Foucault (1978)\nthe most important sites of power lie in everyday social practices\nsuch as social work, medicine and psychiatry, in scientific and social\nscientific disciplines that type individuals and create categories of\nidentity, and in institutions such as prisons, schools and hospitals.\nSuch power is productive: social institutions and practices create\nmodern identities such as gays, Blacks and manic-depressives. For\nButler and others, the construction of men and women takes a similar\npath as the result of compulsory heterosexuality. As a form of power,\ncompulsory heterosexuality imposes a set of norms about how and whom\nwe should desire and establishes a set of sanctions from this set. By\ndoing so, it divides human populations into two genders that are in\nturn supposed to be connected to two sexes with two directions of\nsexual desire. Thus, one is a man with a male body and a desire for\nwomen or one is a woman with a female body and a desire for men.\n\u201cThe heterosexualization of desire,\u201d Butler writes,\n\u201crequires and institutes the production of discrete and\nasymmetrical oppositions between \u2018feminine\u2019 and\n\u2018masculine,\u2019 where these are understood as expressive\nattributes of \u2018male\u2019 and \u2018female\u2019\u201d\n(1990, 17).\n\nThis account of identities as effects of power obviously raises the\nquestion of what happens to our capacities for critical agency and\nrational reflection, capacities to which Marxists and other social\ncritics have traditionally appealed for a purchase on relations of\npower and subordination. If the subject, as a woman or gay person for\nexample, is an effect of power, the structure of oppression is already\nbuilt into the identity. How can women or gay people be agents for the\nemancipation of, or equal justice for, women or gay people if their\nidentity is itself an effect of unequal power relations? Indeed, if we\nbecome subjects at all only within everyday disciplinary practices,\nthen subjects are always already effects of power. To emancipate\nourselves from power would be to emancipate ourselves from ourselves.\nHow then how are we to address issues of freedom and autonomy?\n\nButler looks to resignification. Power not only produces but\nreproduces itself. This constant production and reproduction opens\npossibilities for \u201cresignification, redeployment, subversive\ncitation from within, and interruption and inadvertent convergences\nwith other [power/discourse] networks\u201d (1995, 135). Yet other\nContinental feminists find this approach unsatisfying. Nancy Fraser\nfinds the positive connotations that Butler associates with\nresignification \u201cpuzzling.\u201d \u201cWhy,\u201d she asks,\n\u201cis resignification good? Can\u2019t there be bad (oppressive,\nreactionary) resignifications?\u201d(1995, 67\u20138). If all\nsubjectivity is a construction of power/discourse networks, why should\nwe not simply be content with the subjects that our current\ndisciplinary practices enforce? Or, if some resignifications are good,\nwhich ones? How do we determine which sort we should endorse?\n\nIn general, Fraser thinks feminists too eagerly turned to\npoststructuralist theories in the 1990s and that this turn has\nconsequences: not only does it leave women with no prospects for\nchange other than resignification but it also reduces gender\ninequality to a matter of language and culture. Here her criticism is\ndirected at what she calls Lacanianism in feminism (2013). The work of\nLacanian feminists has some merit, she says, in that it shows gender\nto be a discursive construction. Sexual identity is based on the\nprocess of identification, language, and socialization in which the\nchild enters into the symbolic order, governed by the incest taboo or\nwhat Lacan calls \u201cthe law of the Father.\u201d Subjugation to\nthat law and becoming a subject are thus one and the same. Given the\nlaw\u2019s phallocentric tilt, women are pretty much condemned.\nNevertheless this analysis remains too historically unspecific for\nFraser. What we need from discourse theory, she maintains, are\ninsights into how our social identities are formed and altered over\ntime, how social groups form and disintegrate, how dominant groups\nretain their cultural dominance and what the prospects are for\nemancipatory change.\n\nMoreover, we need to balance cultural with economic analysis. For\nFraser (2007), gender is a two-dimensional identity. It organizes a\nstatus hierarchy, one on which what she calls cultural feminism\nfocuses, that permeates popular culture and everyday interactions in\nways that demean women. But gender also structures a material and\neconomic division between paid productive work and unpaid domestic\nwork, and within paid productive work, it largely structures the\ndivision between higher-paid manufacturing and professional\noccupations and lower-paid, \u201cpink collar\u201d ones. An\nadequate feminist theory, she claims, must therefore allow for two\nindependent, cultural and material analytic perspectives. In another\nwork (2009), she adds a third political perspective to deal with\nissues of representation.  Feminism for the 99%: A Manifesto\n(2019), written with Cinzia Arruzza and Tithi Bhattacharya, takes up\nthese tasks, focusing on the need to fight for affordable housing,\ndecent paying jobs, universal healthcare, and the like in order to win\nfor women and working people in general the freedom to determine the\ncourse of their own lives.\n\nSeyla Benhabib (1995), Amy Allen (2008) and Allison Weir (2013) also\nquestion Butlerian equations between identity, law and power that seem\nto deprive women of agency. Benhabib distinguishes between a stronger\nand a weaker version of the claim that identities such as women and\ngay people are constructions of power (1995, 20). The stronger version\ninsists that subjects are entirely the effects of power, particularly\nof a compulsory heterosexuality, and that as effects they can only\naccept their mode of being a subject or try to subvert it from within.\nA weaker version of the claim, however, would simply emphasize that\ninfants are born into a world of existing gendered relations,\nhierarchies and distributions of power and are acculturated into this\nworld by parents, teachers and the like. To say that infants are born\ninto prevailing structures of power, however, is not to say that they\nare already entirely constituted by them. Hence, Benhabib claims,\nthere remain capacities for reflection and accountability that are not\nsimply themselves effects of power.\n\nWhile more sympathetic to Foucault and Butler, Allen uses Jessica\nBenjamin\u2019s (1988) account of recognition to make a similar\npoint. There may be \u201cno outside to power, in the sense that\nthere is no possible human social world from which power has been\ncompletely eliminated.\u201d Nevertheless, we need not deny\n\u201cmoments of mutual recognition\u2026within ongoing,\ndynamically unfolding, social relationships\u201d that can provide\nfor both the constitution of autonomous selves and a reference point\nfor social and political critique (2008, 91). Weir likewise stresses\nrelations of recognition, as well as of \u201cidentification, of\nflourishing, of meaning, of love, of different kinds of power,\nincluding empowerment and solidarity\u201d (2013, 91). Again,\nresistance to domination is not just a matter of resignifying within\noppressive structures. Rather it is a matter of transforming women.\nIndeed, Weir asks \u201cWhat have we been doing in our women\u2019s\nstudies programs, associations of feminist philosophers and academics,\nfeminist movements, lesbian communities, women\u2019s cooperative,\nand culture building and other alternative communities if we\nhaven\u2019t been \u2026producing women as something other than\nsubjected?\u201d (2013, 94).\n2.1 The Analytic Tradition\n\nWorking from an Anglo-American liberal tradition, Martha Nussbaum\nraises questions similar to those that Allen, Benhabib, Fraser and\nWeir raise about a post-structuralist feminism. Indeed, she thinks the\nlatter is irretrievably self-involved and needs to be rejected in\nfavor of the kind of theoretical and practical work that can end\noppressive practices and institutions (1999a). Her own starting point\nis what she calls the \u201ccapabilities approach,\u201d an approach\nthat is rooted in \u201crespect for the dignity of persons as\nchoosers\u201d (2000, 71\u20132) and that asks what individuals\nwithin a given society are able to do and to be \u2013 what their\ncapabilities or freedoms are. Following John Rawls here Nussbaum\nfocuses on the distribution of resources and opportunities within a\ncountry or political entity. Like Amartya Sen, she adds to\nRawls\u2019 view, first, the question of what individuals\u2019\nneeds for resources are and, second, the question of how they are able\nto convert these resources into human functionings (1999, 34). By\nhuman functionings, Nussbaum means the realization of one or more\ncapability \u2013 the enjoyment of good health, for example. She is\ninterested in both the basic functionings, without which we would not\nregard a life as human or fully human, and the less basic\nfunctionings, without which we would not regard a human life as\nflourishing.\n\nThe \u201cwe\u201d here is not meant to be ethnocentric. The claim\nis, rather, that a just society provides individuals with capabilities\nfor human functionings where the idea of the important capabilities\nis one to which people from different traditions with different\nconceptions of the good could agree as necessary to the pursuit of\ntheir particular conception. This idea provides a checklist of\ncapabilities against which to measure forms of oppression and\ndiscrimination in particular countries. Thus, inequalities based on\ngender hierarchies as well as practices such as female genital\nmutilation will be precluded and a defense of such practices as part\nof the cultural tradition will not work. If cultural tradition\nconfines women to the house, even if widowed and without means of\nsupport, then such practices are to be condemned as violating\ncapabilities for even basic functioning. Indeed, while practices such\nas female genital mutilation and female confinement violate\ncapabilities for life, nutrition and bodily integrity, all\ninequalities based on gender hierarchies, in Nussbaum\u2019s view,\nundermine capabilities for self-respect and emotional development that\nare part of human functioning. Ultimately, Nussbaum\u2019s concerns\nare the same as Fraser\u2019s: that a focus on genealogy and\nresignification cannot do the work of undoing the social, political\nand economic discrimination that women suffer in far too many cultures\nand countries and that it is this discrimination that feminism must\ntry to combat.\n\nOther feminists have concerns about Nussbaum\u2019s approach,\nhowever. Susan Moller Okin objects to the narrative approach that\nNussbaum introduces in Women and Human Development insofar as\nit relies on retelling the experiences of two poor Indian women,\nVasanti and Jayamma. Okin points out that despite the sort of\ncross-cultural dialogue in which Nussbaum thinks feminists should\nengage (Nussbaum 2000, 7), she rarely quotes these women directly and\nrefracts their views through her own (Okin 2003, 295). From where,\nthen, does Nussbaum\u2019s checklist of capabilities come? Okin calls\nher idea of a fully human life \u201chighly intellectualized\u201d\nand maintains that the capacities central to it \u201cseem to derive\nfar more from an Aristotelian ideal than from any deep or broad\nfamiliarity with the lives of women in the less developed world\u201d\n(2003, 296). Likewise, while Alison Jaggar thinks the narrative\napproach may be anodyne as long as it is meant simply heuristically,\nshe argues that there is little evidence that Nussbaum\u2019s list of\ncapabilities reflects anything like a consensus or even overlapping\nconsensus of \u201cpeople across the world who are reasonably\nwell-informed and uncoerced\u201d (2006, 313). Rather, in spite of a\nlong list of interlocutors, Jagger thinks Nussbaum pays insufficient\nattention to questions of inclusiveness and representation.\n2.3 Conclusion\n\nFeminists in both the analytic and Continental traditions raise\nconcerns about a post-structuralist identification of the subject,\nincluding the feminist subject, with power. If women, like gay people\nand others, are the effects of discourses of power how can they also\nbe the agents of their own emancipation? Some feminists find this\nquestion to be so removed from the horrific lives many women live as\nto be farcical. For example, Nussbaum asks that we attend to\ncapacities and functionings and Fraser likewise insists that we move\naway from what she sees as purely cultural concerns to include\nsocio-economic ones. Others try to secure theoretical grounds for\nagency and autonomy outside of power.\n3. Epistemic Injustice\n\nFeminism has an obvious relation to epistemology insofar as it must\njustify the legitimacy of its claims and the credibility of those\nmaking them. Miranda Fricker\u2019s book, Epistemic Injustice:\nPower and Ethics of Knowing (2007) has grounded much of the\ncurrent discussion in the analytic tradition, which has largely\nfocused on cataloging and categorizing instances of epistemic\ninjustice. The Continental tradition traces this issue back to\nconcerns with ideology and power/knowledge regimes that have long been\na part of emancipatory discussions.\n3.1 The Analytic Tradition\n\nFricker takes up two varieties of epistemic injustice: testimonial and\nhermeneutical. Her account of the former can be seen as a development\nof claims Jennifer Hornsby and Rae Langton (1998) made about silencing\nwith reference to Catharine MacKinnon\u2019s claim that pornography\ninterferes with women\u2019s freedom of speech (1993). Freedom of\nspeech involves not simply the ability to make claims but, more\nimportantly, the ability to have illocutionary effects in which\none\u2019s audience takes up those claims. MacKinnon focuses on the\nability to refuse sex by saying no. Under the influence of pornography\none\u2019s audience may not recognize what one is trying to do with\none\u2019s words and may fail to take this no as a refusal. For\nFricker, structural identity prejudices in general affect one\u2019s\ncredibility as a speaker and conveyor of knowledge. Her example is the\nway, in the screenplay of \u201cThe Talented Mr. Ripley,\u201d Marge\nSherwood is unable to communicate her suspicions about Ripley to her\nfather-in-law, Herbert Greenleaf, because of the identity prejudices\nhe holds about women. Assuming that women tend to respond emotionally\ninstead of rationally to a situation, he downgrades her credibility\nand effectively silences her. The testimonial injustice here excludes\nSherwood from the social practice of pooling information.\n\nKristie Dotson (2011) distinguishes two different kinds of silencing\npractices: testimonial quieting and testimonial smothering. While\ntestimonial quieting characterizes a failure to recognize the speaker\nas a knower and thus to offer the speaker appropriate uptake, Dotson\ndescribes testimonial smothering as a coerced truncation by speakers\nof their own testimony. Speakers recognize that their audiences are\nunwilling or unable to offer appropriate uptake to their testimony,\nand in response, limit and shape their testimony in order to\n\u201cinsure that the testimony contains only content for which\none\u2019s audience demonstrates testimonial competence\u201d (2011,\n244). Dotson characterizes both of these silencing practices as forms\nof epistemic violence, and both have dramatic effects for the\nepistemic pursuits of individuals and communities alike.\n\nDotson (2017) extends this analysis by offering an epistemological\nreading of Pauli Murray\u2019s (1947) conception of a Jane Crow\nsystem of subordination, one that both targets Black women, making\nthem hypervisible, and ignores them, making them invisible. Dotston\nis interested in the production of knowledge that facilitates this\nkind of subordination and identifies three conditions for it. First,\nshared assumptions and other epistemic resources can highlight certain\nsubjects for study and render others uninteresting or irrelevant. From\nthis point of view, Black women occupy \u201cnegative socio-epistemic\nspace.\u201d Second, this negative-epistemic space means that Black women\nlack credibility precisely in trying to articulate it. Finally, in\nwhat Dotson calls epistemic backgrounding, Black women serve as the\nbackdrop for some other subjects of study \u2013 for example, in\nclaims that Black boys are the most endangered U.S. population, as if\nthe factors that cause this endangerment (poverty, poor schools and\nthe character of policing) do not apply to Black girls as well.\n\nWith regard to hermeneutical injustice, Fricker focuses on gaps in the\ncollective hermeneutical resources that make it difficult for members\nof particular groups, including women, to make sense out of and\narticulate important areas of their experience. The available\nresources are either not adequate for expressing these areas of\nexperience or they are misleading. Where this failure or inadequacy\naffects people differentially it is unjust, Fricker argues. As an\nexample she points to the damage done to many women\u2019s lives and\ncareers after they suffered unwanted sexual advances on the job before\nsexual harassment was a hermeneutical resource available to make sense\nout of their experience (2007, 152). Fricker thinks it would be a\nmistake to see this gap in the collective hermeneutic resources as\nmerely bad timing, as might be the case if one suffered from a disease\nthat had not yet been diagnosed or understood. Rather, to the extent\nthat the gap affected women and their sexual harassers differentially\nit led to an injustice. It also derived from one. Fricker argues that\nthe hermeneutical gap was the result of \u201cunequal hermeneutical\nparticipation\u201d in which women were left out of or barred from\nengaging in the formation of the relevant collective understandings\n(Fricker 2007: 152). This marginalization, she argues, results from a\ncombination of two forms of power: identity power that downgrades a\nspeaker\u2019s credibility and material power. In a social world in\nwhich men have more power than women, men also have more say over\ndefining what experiences mean and the result is to render \u201cthe\ncollective hermeneutical resource structurally prejudiced\u201d\n(2007, 154\u20135).\n\nShelley Tremain (2017) finds a problem with Fricker\u2019s\ndistinction between hermeneutical gaps due to diseases not yet\ndiagnosed and hermeneutical gaps that reflect hermeneutical injustice.\nWhile Fricker wants to see the former as a case of mere bad luck,\nTremain points to the lack of hermeneutical resources many disabled\npeople suffer because of social, cultural and political norms that are\nas inadequate and misleading as those distorting attempts to\narticulate the experience of sexual harassment. As she writes,\n\u201cUntil the relatively recent formation and rise of \u2018the\nmad pride movement\u2019 and related social movements, the\nhermeneutical resources that such disabled people required in order to\ncollectively understand the political character of their situation\nwere unavailable to them\u201d (178).\n\nOther feminists add to Fricker\u2019s account of hermeneutical\ninjustice just as they do to her account of testimonial injustice.\nFollowing up on Charles Mills\u2019 account of white ignorance\n(1998), Gaile Pohlhaus, Jr., for example, conceives of the consequence\nof this structural prejudice as a willful hermeneutical ignorance in\nwhich \u201cdominantly situated knowers\u2026continue to\nmisunderstand and misinterpret the world\u201d (2012, 716). Dotson\nuses this idea of willful hermeneutical ignorance to identify a third\nfeature of epistemic injustice along with testimonial and\nhermeneutical injustice: namely contributory injustice in which\nwillful hermeneutical ignorance compromises a speaker\u2019s\nepistemic agency and obstructs the capacity to contribute to a\ncommunity\u2019s collective hermeneutical resources (2012, 31).\n\nFricker\u2019s solution to testimonial injustice relies on the\nvirtuous sensibility that allows one, when necessary, to neutralize\none\u2019s identity prejudices and negative credibility judgments\nabout speakers while her solution to hermeneutical injustice relies on\nan awareness of possible gaps in the hermeneutical resources available\nto them. In responding to her critics, Fricker also distinguishes\nbetween \u201cin-group intelligibility\u201d within marginalized\ngroups and their \u201cfrustratingly failed attempts to\ncommunicate\u201d (2016, 167) with dominant groups. Together with\nJenkins she also underscores the relation between testimonial\ninjustice and ignorance, especially with regard to trans experiences\n(2017).\n3.2 The Continental Tradition\n\nFeminists in the Continental tradition are also interested in\nFricker\u2019s work. Warnke (2014) as well as Cynthia Nielsen and\nDavid Utsler (2023) note its affinities with Gadamer\u2019s\nhermeneutics, although they note that unlike Gadamer, Fricker supposes\nthe possibility of neutralizing one\u2019s identity prejudices where\nidentity is not relevant. For Gadamer, because prejudices are\nineradicable as anticipatory orientations, we cannot neutralize them.\nWe can, however, reveal them to ourselves \u2013 and thereby question\nthem \u2013 by always according an initial credibility to our\ninterlocutors, not, as Fricker supposes, only when we have reason to\nsuspect identity prejudice. \n\nOther feminists in the Continental tradition are concerned with\nFricker\u2019s reliance on virtue ethics and they stress the need to\ngo beyond the dyadic instances of epistemic injustice on which she\nfocuses. Axel Honneth (2023) argues for the necessity of embedding\nquestions of epistemic injustice in normative social theory and, in\nparticular, in a theory of social struggles for recognition. Alcoff\n(2017) makes three recommendations. First, we can look at what\nJos\u00e9 Medina calls \u201ccomplex histories and chains of social\ninteractions that go beyond particular pairs and clusters of\nsubjects\u201d (Medina 2013, 60). Second, we can look at\nFoucault\u2019s account of power/knowledge regimes for a robust\naccount of collective hermeneutical resources and the exclusions they\nenforce as well of the institutional mechanisms that determine what is\nand is not to count as knowledge and who is and who is not to count as\na knower. Finally, we can look at Foucault\u2019s development of\ngenealogy as a form of critique that allows for the disruption of\nepistemic hierarchies that may be inherited but that are nonetheless\ncontingent.\n\nIn addition to Gadamer and Foucault, feminists in the Continental\ntradition look to the Marxist tradition and, in particular, to the\nwork of J\u00fcrgen Habermas. What Fricker conceives of as structural\nprejudice in the collective hermeneutical resources, they see as the\nsort of ideological obfuscation that undermines a society\u2019s\ncapacity to understand its own creations. Thus, Habermas points to the\npower-relations our hermeneutical resources include and asks us not to\nforget that \u201cthe background consensus of established traditions\n\u2026 can be a consciousness forged of compulsions.\u201d (1977,\n358\u20139). (Also see Mills 2017.) Habermas\u2019s early work\nfocused on psychoanalysis as a model for a critical social theory but\nhe later turns to a reconstructive science of communicative competence\nand to the possibilities of deliberative forms of democracy.\nDeliberative democratic theory looks to non-coercive exchanges of\narguments among free and equal citizens who justify their claims and\nproposals by appealing to considerations that can be accepted by all\nthose affected (1998, 458). Accordingly, Benhabib (1996) maintains\nthat only those norms are valid that are agreed to in deliberations\nthat have the following features:\n\n1) participation in such deliberation is governed by norms of equality\nand symmetry; all have the same chances to initiate speech acts, to\nquestion, to interrogate, and to open debate; 2) all have the right to\nquestion the assigned topics of conversation; and 3) all have the\nright to initiate reflexive arguments about the very rules of the\ndiscourse procedure and the way in which they are applied or carried\nout (70).\n\n\nOther feminists have sought an expanded version of deliberative theory\nthat recognizes impediments to the participation of women and other\nmarginalized groups. Fraser insists that critical theory needs to\n\u201crender visible the ways in which societal inequality infects formally\ninclusive public spheres and taints discursive interaction within\nthem\u201d (1992, 121). She thus calls for a principle of participatory\nparity where all members of a society participate as peers. Social\npolicies and actions must thus acknowledge the legitimacy of claims to\nrecognition, achieve fairness in distributing resources and assure\npolitical representation (2005). For her part, Young (1996) questions\nthe exclusionary function of rational argumentation. She thus\nsubstitutes communicative for deliberative democracy in order to\nexpand the scope of considerations beyond the exchange of reasons to\ninclude story-telling as well as argumentation on grounds close to\nFricker\u2019s and Dotson\u2019s concerns: namely that power\nrelations can stifle speech (1996). Likewise Simone Chambers looks to\na melding of deliberative and diversity theory (2003) while Noelle\nMcAfee (2008) looks beyond a Habermasian proceduralism to an\nintegrative model of public deliberation that respects the importance\nof multiple, partial views.\n3.3 Conclusion\n\nThe concept of epistemic injustice has proved a fruitful one for\nfeminists, as for critical race theorists, disability theorists and\nothers. Those in the analytic tradition have focused on mapping its\ncontours, nailing down the precise form of injustice it involves and\nexposing forms of socially positioned ignorance in which dominant\ngroups continue to misapprehend the world. Those in the Continental\ntradition conceive of such ignorance as ideology and, like those in\nthe analytic tradition, understand it as a mechanism of both\ndistortion and silencing. They have also probed the conditions for\nforms of public communication and discourse free of coercion. Moving\non from Fricker\u2019s work, feminists in both analytic and\nContinental traditions remain interested in expanding the concept of\nepistemic injustice beyond dyadic relations to examine its systemic\nreach and consequences.\n4. General Conclusion\n\nAnalytic and Continental feminists share interests in avoiding\nexclusion in attempts to define women, in overcoming patriarchal forms\nof oppression and in securing the claims of women to know and to\nparticipate in epistemic projects. Analytic and continental feminists\nsometimes pursue these interests in different ways, sometimes in\nsimilar ways and sometimes in conversation with one another.\nCollectively they take up and further develop a rich history of\nliberal, Marxist, post-structuralist, hermeneutic and linguistic\nthought.\n",
