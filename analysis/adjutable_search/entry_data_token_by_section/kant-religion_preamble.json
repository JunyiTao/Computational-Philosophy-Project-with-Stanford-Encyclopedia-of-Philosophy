    "main_text": "\n\nKant has long been seen as hostile to religion. Many of his\ncontemporaries, ranging from his students to the Prussian authorities,\nsaw his Critical project as inimical to traditional Christianity. The\nimpression of Kant as a fundamentally secular philosopher became even\nmore deeply entrenched through the twentieth century, though this is\nbelied by a closer inspection of his writings both before and after\nthe publication of his Critique of Pure Reason (1781), i.e.,\nwhat are commonly referred to as his \u201cpre-Critical\u201d and\n\u201cCritical\u201d periods.\n\nAfter an initial overview discussion of Kant\u2019s philosophy of\nreligion, this entry will turn to his views during the pre-Critical\nand then Critical periods. With regards to the former period, we will\ndiscuss Kant\u2019s religious background, his views on the\nrelationship between God and nature, and then how some of the key\nfigures of the period influenced his philosophy of religion. We will\nalso discuss his conception of God and approach to the arguments for\nGod\u2019s existence during this period.\n\nWe will then turn to his Critical period, where we will discuss how\nTranscendental Idealism shaped his philosophy of religion, his\nCritical treatment of the arguments for God\u2019s existence, his\nconception of God, epistemology of religion, distinction between Deism\nand Theism, the relationship between the highest good and the\npractical postulates, interpretations of his approach to Christian\ndoctrine, an overview of the four parts of Religion within the\nBoundaries of Mere Reason, and, finally, his Opus\nPostumum. Throughout, attention will be paid to many of the\npoints of interpretative dispute over key aspects of his philosophy of\nreligion.\n",
