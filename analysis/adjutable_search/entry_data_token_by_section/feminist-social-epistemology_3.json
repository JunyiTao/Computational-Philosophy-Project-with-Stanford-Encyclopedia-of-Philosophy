    "main_text": "Social Models of Knowers || Interactive and Relational Knowers\n2.2 Interactive and Relational Knowers\n\n\nFeminist social epistemologists also stress the socially interactive\nnature of knowers, arguing that epistemically, human beings are deeply\ndependent on one another. At least three strains of argument support a\nrecognition of our epistemic dependence and correspondingly, the\ninteractive nature of knowers.\n\nFirst, feminist social epistemologists who focus on institutional\nforms of knowing such as scientific research, medical practice, and\nlegal systems understand that in these contexts we are highly reliant\non others to produce knowledge for us. Not only do laypersons rely on\nexperts for knowledge, but even within epistemic communities such as\nin research teams there are cognitive divisions of labor that result\nin a dependence on other experts for knowledge relevant to one\u2019s\nown research. More than many other social epistemologists interested\nin cognitive divisions of labor, feminist social epistemologists\ndevelop analyses that attend to the power dynamics within epistemic\ncommunities, examining correlations between structures of cognitive\nand social authority, and demonstrating their influence on the\ndirection of research.\n Kathryn Pyne Addelson (1983), for example,\nargues that in order to increase the rationality of scientific\nresearch, we need to include in our assessments criticism of the\nsocial arrangements within the scientific communities. For example, if\nsocial relations are such that men disproportionately hold the most\nsignificant positions of social and cognitive authority within\nscientific communities, the direction of research as well as the\nchoice of methods and metaphysical assumptions underlying research may\ndisproportionately reflect men\u2019s experiences and perspectives.\nUnderstanding the workings of such social arrangements can help us\nbetter assess the overall rationality and quality of scientific\nresearch. Feminists have also stressed the particular vulnerabilities\nof the oppressed that stem from their reliance on experts, when lines\nof credibility and expertise are woven into an oppressive set of\nsocial arrangements (Code 1991, 2006; Sherwin 1992).  Whereas some\nsocial epistemologists take the presence of cognitive divisions of\nlabor to offer support for a view of communities as\nknowers,[10]\nthose feminist social epistemologists who focus on cognitive divisions\nof labor (as opposed to other dimensions of knowing that might point\nin the direction of communities as knowers) tend to focus instead on\nthe epistemic role of trust, allowing that individuals can know beyond\ntheir personal grasp of the evidence, but insisting on philosophical\nanalysis of the vulnerabilities and negotiations that play out through\nsuch dependence on others (Scheman 2001; Code 2006).\n\n\nSecond, arguments to the effect that knowers are differentiated from\neach other along the lines of social location suggest that in many\ncases knowers must rely on others differently situated from themselves\nin order to attain certain forms of knowledge. If perspectives differ\nalong the lines of social location, then one cannot necessarily trust\none\u2019s own perspective as epistemically reliable in a particular area\nof knowledge and one will need to interact with others differently\nsocially located in order to increase the reliability of one\u2019s\nknowing. For example, a white male department chair may need to\nconsult with professors who have experienced sexism and racism in the\nclassroom in order to determine whether a white male student complaint\nabout a young Chicana professor is legitimate or not (Alcoff 2001).\nMany feminist social epistemologists who focus on socially\ndifferentiated knowers argue that the necessary interaction cannot\njust be epistemic in nature; when categories of social location are\nhierarchically structured as they are in oppressive societies, social\nand political alliances must be built between groups in order to\ndevelop the trust necessary to share knowledge across social\nlocations.  Others have argued that in some cases the distrust across\nsocial locations is so strong that only relationships of friendship\nare sufficiently deep to allow for the sharing of knowledge and\nunderstanding across locations (Lugones 1987).\n\n\nThird, recognizing that as children we are highly dependent on others\nboth for our care and for the development of our epistemic skills,\nsome feminist social epistemologists have argued that our epistemic\ndependence runs as deep as the conditions of epistemic agency\nitself. Building on the work of Annette Baier (1985), Lorraine Code\nhas argued that epistemically, knowers are best thought of as \u201csecond\npersons\u201d, who acquire epistemic skills through others, and who are\ndependent on others\u2019 acknowledgment of them as an epistemic agent in\norder to develop and exercise epistemic agency (Code 1991). It is\nthrough our interactions with others and our development as children\nthat we learn the skills of knowing, learn what constitutes knowing,\nand come to be counted among others as knowers. An implication of\nCode\u2019s view is that if one is systematically denied acknowledgment as\na knower and credibility is consistently withheld, as can happen in\nsystems of oppression, then one\u2019s epistemic agency and capacity to\nknow will be diminished. Her arguments support a relational view of\nepistemic agency, one that still recognizes individuals as knowers,\nbut conceptualizes them as socially constituted and epistemically\ndependent on their interactions with others. Similarly Miranda Fricker\ntakes our role as testifiers to be central to epistemic agency, such\nthat if credibility is consistently denied, one\u2019s epistemic agency is\nundermined (Fricker 2007). \n\n\nWhile some feminist social epistemologists such as Code and Fricker focus on\ninterpersonal relations within a community, others draw attention to\nthe importance of a knower\u2019s relations with multiple communities. They\nargue that many of the insights of feminist critics of science were\nmade possible by bridge knowers, individual feminist scientists\ninteracting with both scientific communities and feminist communities (Fehr 2011).\nSuch cases suggest the need for a model of knowers that accounts for an\nindividual\u2019s dynamic relations with multiple communities (Tuana 1995).\nThe idea of knowers as individuals-in-communities has been\nsuggested as a model that both captures the importance of\ninterrelations with multiple communities and, by keeping individual\nknowers in the foreground, is capable of attending to the power\nrelations that individual knowers must negotiate within those\ncommunities (Grasswick 2004).\n\n\nAcknowledgment of the various forms of our epistemic interdependence\nhas motivated investigations of the dynamics of social interaction and\ntheir effects on knowledge production. For example, recognizing that\nwe frequently rely on the testimony of others, yet also make judgments\non the worth of the testimony, feminist social epistemologists have\ninvestigated the complex links between assignments of credibility and\nsocial position (Alcoff 2001; Code 1995; Jones 2002). Many conclude\nthat because of our epistemic interdependence, adequate epistemic\nanalysis must attend to the political and moral dimensions of our\nsocial-epistemic interactions (Code 1995). For example, Miranda\nFricker argues that there is social pressure to grant greater than\nwarranted degrees of credibility to those with social power, with the\neffect that we do less well at attaining truths and avoiding\nfalsehoods.  Her conclusion is that an adequate social epistemology\nmust acknowledge and assess the epistemic effects of power\nrelations. As she writes, \u201cepistemology will not be truly socialized\nuntil it has been appropriately politicized\u201d (Fricker 1998,\n174). Feminist arguments for the importance of trust in knowing (Code\n1991, 1995; Scheman 2001) coupled with their analyses of the moral and\naffective dimensions of trust (Baier 1986; Jones 1996, 2002) also\nsuggest that the moral quality of social relations is important to\nassess as part of one\u2019s epistemic analysis. Attention to the links\nbetween the moral and the epistemic have developed in detail with\nrecent developments on the topic of epistemic injustice (see Section\n4: Epistemic Values, Ethics, and Democracy). \n",
