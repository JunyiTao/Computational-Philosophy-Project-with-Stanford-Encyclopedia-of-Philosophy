    "main_text": "Formal Theories of Facts || Facts and Propositions\n2.4 Facts and Propositions\n\nAs we pointed out above, one view about facts is that to be a fact is\nto be a true proposition. On another, incompatible view, facts are\nwhat make true propositions true, or more generally, account for their\ntruth. The search for what accounts for the truth of propositions is,\nas we have seen, actually one main rationale for the introduction of\nfacts. In what follows we shall deal with the two views.\n\nBy \u2018proposition\u2019, we shall mean truth-bearer, and\nremain neutral as to whether truth-bearers are sentences, statements,\nbeliefs or abstract objects expressed by sentences, for\ninstance\u2014except in\n section 2.4.1.\n\nEach world \\(w\\) has its set \\(\\textrm{T}_w\\) of true propositions,\nand we call \\(\\TS(p)\\) (the truth-set of \\(p\\)) the set of\nall worlds at which \\(p\\) is true. Where \\(p\\) is a proposition, let\n\\(\\ES(p)\\) (the existence-set of \\(p\\)) be the set of all\nworlds at which it exists.\n2.4.1 Facts as True Propositions\n\nLet us consider here the view that to be a fact is to be a true\nproposition. On such a view, propositions cannot be sentences or\nstatements or beliefs. They are, perhaps, abstract entities expressed\nor designated by sentences.\n\nThere is an issue as to what the existence-conditions for propositions\n(taken in that sense, the qualification will be constant in this\nsection) are, which is relevant for the view under consideration. On\none view, propositions exist necessarily, i.e., the existence-set of\nany proposition is \\(W\\), the set of all possible worlds. On another\nview, the existence of a proposition is in general world-relative.\n\nThe world-relative view comes in several variants. Two such variants\nwhich will be of central interest to us correspond to the two possible\nanswers to the question \u2018Can a proposition be true without\nexisting?\u2019. The view that a proposition can be true without\nexisting is quite plausible under the assumption that propositions\nexpressed by sentences which contain proper names are composite\nobjects which literally contain the individuals denoted by these\nnames. For it is plausible to maintain that no whole can exist without\nits parts, and if this and the previously mentioned assumption are\ntrue, then the proposition expressed by \u2018Socrates is not a\nphilosopher\u2019 will turn out true in worlds where it does not\nexist (it is assumed here that there can be no non-existent\nphilosopher, and that Socrates is not a necessary existent). (Against\nthis line of thought, see the discussion of New Actualism in the entry\non\n actualism.)\n\nThere is a conception of propositions according to which they are sets\nof worlds (see, e.g., Stalnaker 1976). On such a conception, the\ntruth-set of a proposition is the proposition itself, and issues about\npropositional existence remain: it may be held that propositions exist\nnecessarily, or that their existence is in general world-relative. The\nfirst option seems intrinsically the most natural, and a proponent of\nthe world-relative view will most naturally identify the existence-set\nof a proposition with its truth-set\u2014or so it seems.\n\nWhere \\(w\\) is a world, let \\(P_w\\) be the set of propositions which\nexists in it, and let \\(P\\) be \\(\\cup_{w\\in W} P_{w}\\), the set of all\npropositions. On the view that to be a fact is to be a true\nproposition, the set of facts which exist in world \\(w\\) is the set of\nall propositions which exist and are true at \\(w\\), i.e., \\(F_{w} =\nT_w \\cap P_{w}\\), and the existence-set of a fact \\(x\\) is \\(\\ES(x)\n\\cap \\TS(x)\\). (There is a similar view according to which all facts\nare true propositions, while some true propositions\u2014say, the\ncomplex ones\u2014may not be facts, but we leave it aside.) Of\ncourse, under the assumption that no proposition can be true without\nexisting, in particular under the assumption that they exist\nnecessarily, for every world \\(w, F_{w} = T_{w}\\), and the\nexistence-set of a fact \\(x\\) is \\(\\TS(x)\\).\n\nSuppose that propositions exist necessarily. It is plausible to say\nthat propositions can be freely negated, conjoined and disjoined to\nother propositions. On that view, there are operations of negation,\nconjunction and disjunction of facts which obey the principles we\npreviously introduced. The resulting view is thus extremely strong. If\nnot all propositions exist necessarily, then questions related to the\nBoolean operations receive answers which may vary according to the\nexistence-conditions which are imposed on propositions.\n2.4.2 Making True\n\nAs we have emphasized, one of the main rationale for introducing facts\nhas been to account for the truth of true propositions. The idea is\nthat whenever a proposition is true, its truth is to be explained in\nterms of the existence and / or non-existence of some facts.\n\nA minimal requirement one may wish to impose in that direction is the\nfollowing:\n\n\nSupervenience. \\(F_{w} = F_{v}\\) implies \\(T_{w} =\nT_{v}\\).\n\n\nThis says that truth supervenes on facts: no difference in truth\nwithout a difference in facts.\n\nSupervenience is a direct consequence of No Twins,\nbut one may wish to leave open the possibility of distinct worlds\ncontaining the same facts. (On the view that to be a fact is to be a\ntrue proposition, Supervenience trivially holds if it is\nassumed that no proposition can be true if it does not exist. If that\nassumption is dropped, then there is room for Supervenience\nto fail. That might be taken to be an argument for keeping the\nassumption on the view under consideration.)\n\nLet us say that a property \\(\\phi\\) is a fact-condition iff\nit is a binary relation connecting sets of sets of facts and worlds,\nsuch that given any set of sets of facts \\(\\Gamma\\) and any worlds\n\\(w\\) and \\(v\\), if \\(F_{w} = F_{v}\\), then \\(\\phi(\\Gamma ,w)\\) iff\n\\(\\phi(\\Gamma ,v)\\) (i.e., the holding of the condition supervenes on\nwhich facts there are). The following principle better captures the\nidea that facts account for the truth of true propositions:\n\n\nDetermination. For every proposition \\(p\\) and every world\n\\(w\\) at which it is true, there exists a fact-condition \\(\\phi\\) and\na set \\(\\Gamma\\) of sets of facts such that\n\n\\(\\phi(\\Gamma ,w)\\), and\nfor every world \\(v\\) such that \\(\\phi(\\Gamma ,v), p\\) is true at\n\\(v\\).\n\n\n\nDetermination clearly entails Supervenience.\n\nLet us examine some stronger principles. Let us say that some given\nfacts (jointly) necessitate proposition \\(p\\) iff \\(p\\) is\ntrue in every world where they all exist. The facts in set \\(G\\)\n(jointly) necessitate \\(p\\) iff \\(\\CES(G) \\subseteq \\TS(p)\\). Let us\nalso say that some given facts (jointly) make true\nproposition \\(p\\) in world \\(w\\) iff they all exist in \\(w\\) and they\nnecessitate the proposition. Let us finally say that proposition \\(p\\)\nrepresents some given facts iff in every world where \\(p\\) is\ntrue, some of them exist. Proposition \\(p\\) represents the facts in\n\\(G\\) iff \\(\\TS(p) \\subseteq \\DES(G)\\).\n\nOur definition of truthmaking fails to capture the explanatory\ncharacter of the notion people have usually in mind when they talk\nabout truthmaking. If something makes a given proposition\ntrue, it is usually assumed, then the existence of that thing explains\nthe truth of the proposition. Now it should be clear that truthmaking\nas we have defined it is not explanatory in this sense. For everything\nwhatsoever is a truthmaker (in our sense) for any necessary\nproposition, while arguably, the obtaining of the fact that Philipp\nlives in Geneva fails to explain the truth of your favourite\ntautology. Or again, consider Socrates and its singleton-set,\n[Socrates]. It may be argued, as we previously stressed, that granted\nthat there are such things as the fact that Socrates exists and the\nfact that [Socrates] exists, these two facts obtain in exactly the\nsame worlds. Assume this is the case. Now some may be happy with the\nview that the fact that Socrates exists is a truthmaker (in the usual\nsense) for the proposition that Socrates exists\u2014and so with the\nview that the obtaining of the fact explains the truth of the\nproposition, but the view that the truth of that proposition is\nexplained by the obtaining of the fact that the singleton exists is\nhighly implausible. Yet if the fact that Socrates exists is a\ntruthmaker (in our sense) for the proposition that Socrates exists,\nthen the fact that the singleton exists is also a truthmaker (in our\nsense) for that proposition.\n\nRepresentation, as we have defined it, is also quite remote from what\npeople usually have in mind when they speak of propositions\nrepresenting facts: propositions which cannot be true represent (in\nour sense) any fact whatsoever, and if the proposition that Socrates\nexists represents (in our sense) the fact that Socrates exists, then\nit also represents (in our sense) the fact that [Socrates] exists\n(granted that these two facts exist at the same worlds).\n\nDespite the fact that truthmaking as defined above does not to capture\nthe usual concept of making true, we shall not deal with the latter\nconcept here. And we shall not deal either with the usual notion of\nrepresentation.\n\nLet us now turn to the stronger principles. A very strong principle\nconnecting propositions and facts says that for every proposition\n\\(p\\) which can be true, there exists a fact represented by \\(p\\)\nwhich necessitates \\(p\\) (i.e., a fact which makes the proposition\ntrue in every world where it is true). The principle just says that\nfor every proposition which can be true, there is a fact whose\nexistence-set is identical to the proposition\u2019s truth-set:\n\nP1.\\(\\forall p\\in\nP^{\\circ} \\exists x\\in F \\, \\ES(x) = \\TS(p)\\).\n\n\n(\\(P^{\\circ}\\) is the set of all propositions which can be true.)\n\nThis is a very strong principle. Under reasonable assumptions, P1\nentails the strong principle W4. For instance, this is so under the\nassumption that every set of worlds is the truth-set of some\nproposition. This assumption trivially holds if sets of worlds are\ntaken to be propositions, but such an assumption is not needed. For\nlet \\(V\\) be any set of worlds. Assume that No Twins is true.\nTo each world \\(w\\) associate the conjunction \\(c_w\\) of all\npropositions true in \\(w\\) (we suppose it exists), and consider the\ndisjunction \\(d_V\\) of all \\(c_w, w\\in V\\) (we suppose it exists).\nThen \\(\\TS(d_V) = V\\).\n\nTheory F(A)-Cond described in Fine 1982 licences P1, as well as the\ntheory put forward in Zalta 1991 (cf. the supplementary document\n Some Formal Theories in the Literature).\n As we saw, Taylor (1985) has no modal theory of facts, but it seems\nthat in a natural modal extension of his theory, P1 should hold.\nNotice that P1 is immediate on the view that facts are sets of worlds,\nand that all non-empty sets of worlds are facts (the view put forward\nin Restall 2004). For then, \\(\\ES(x) = x\\) for any fact \\(x\\).\n\nP1 might be accepted by a proponent of theory \\(\\textrm{T}_4\\).\nConsider the following assumptions \\((H_0\\) is a selected independent\nset which generates \\(F\\) via Booleanization):\n\nAll propositions are Boolean compounds of propositions taken from\na special set, the set of atomic propositions;\nTo each atomic proposition \\(p\\) corresponds a fact \\(x\\) in\n\\(H_0\\) such that \\(\\ES(x) = \\TS(p)\\).\n\n\nA friend of \\(\\textrm{T}_4\\) may be willing to accept them, and doing\nso he will thereby endorse P1.\n\nThere is a simpler argument against P1 enemies of disjunctive facts\nmay advance. Take any two propositions \\(p\\) and \\(q\\) and assume they\nhave a disjunction \\(r\\) (we may assume that \\(p\\) can be true and\n\\(q\\) false, and vice versa). By P1, there are facts \\(x, y\\) and\n\\(z\\) such that \\(\\ES(x) = \\TS(p)\\) and \\(\\ES(y) = \\TS(q)\\) and\n\\(\\ES(z) = \\TS(r)\\). So \\(\\ES(z) = \\ES(x) \\cup \\ES(y)\\), and \\(z\\)\nbehaves like a disjunctive fact: it exists in a world iff \\(x\\) or\n\\(y\\) does.\n\nThose who take these to be problems may endorse the following weaker\nprinciple: for every proposition \\(p\\) which can be true and every\nworld \\(w\\) at which it is true, there is a fact which makes it true.\nThat principle is equivalent to: for every proposition \\(p\\) which can\nbe true, there exists a set of facts \\(G\\) whose members are\nrepresented by \\(p\\) such that every member of \\(G\\) necessitates\n\\(p\\). To put it differently, for every proposition which can be true,\nthere is set of facts whose disjunctive existence-set is identical to\nthe proposition\u2019s truth-set:\n\nP2. \\(\\forall p\\in\nP^{\\circ} \\exists G\\subseteq F \\, \\DES(G) = \\TS(p)\\).\n\n\nThis principle is endorsed by Armstrong (1997), and seems to be taken\nby Fine as fitting his theory C-Cond (Fine 1982; cf. the supplementary\ndocument\n Some Formal Theories in the Literature).\n\nBut there are still potential problems, this time related to\nconjunction.\n\nFor take the conjunctive proposition that Socrates is a philosopher\nand Frege is human. P2 tells us that there is a set of facts \\(K\\)\nsuch that \\(\\DES(K)\\) is the truth-set of that proposition. What is\nthat set of facts? One may be tempted to answer: the set whose sole\nmember is the fact that Socrates is a philosopher and Frege is human.\nIt is hard to see which other answer could be provided, and so P2\nseems to commit one to conjunctive facts.\n\nThose who are bothered by these features of P1 and P2 may wish to\nadopt the following principle: there is a special set of propositions\n\\(Q\\) such that (i) the restriction of P1 to \\(Q\\) holds, i.e., for\nevery \\(p\\) in \\(Q\\), there is a fact \\(x\\) such that \\(\\ES(x) =\n\\TS(p)\\), and (ii) for every world \\(w\\) where a proposition \\(p\\) is\ntrue, there is a part \\(R\\) of \\(Q\\) whose members are true, and such\nthat in every world where they are true, \\(p\\) is true.\n\nBut there are still potential problems, which actually affect P2 as\nwell, this time related to negation. Take the negative proposition\nthat Socrates is not a philosopher. By P2, there is a set of facts\n\\(K\\) such that \\(\\DES(K)\\) is the truth-set of that proposition. What\nis that set of facts? One may wish to answer: the set whose sole\nmember is the fact that Socrates is not a philosopher. Again, it is\nhard to think of any alternative, and so P2 seems to commit one to\nnegative facts. Alternatively, assume the previous principle. Shall we\ntake the proposition that Socrates is not a philosopher to be in \\(Q\\)\nor not? If we do, then we are in the same situation as before: we seem\nto be committed to negative facts. If we do not, it is hard to see\nwhich set of propositions \\(R \\subseteq Q\\) satisfying condition (ii)\nabove we are going to choose.\n\nIn order to deal with negative propositions, Armstrong (1997) invokes\na certain kind of facts which he calls \u2018totality facts\u2019,\nfacts which can be designated by means of expressions of type\n\u2018the fact that \\(X\\) are all the \\(F\\)s that there are\u2019,\nwhere \u2018\\(X\\)\u2019 is a rigid plural designator and\n\u2018\\(F\\)\u2019 a predicate. The proposition that Socrates is not\na philosopher is made true, on his view, by the fact that the atomic\nfacts which actually obtain are all the atomic facts there are\u2014a\ntotality fact.\n\nThose who are reluctant to admit disjunctive, conjunctive, negative\nand totality facts may wish to adopt the following principle (weaker\nthan P2):\n\nP3. \\[\\begin{align*}\\forall p\\in P^{\\circ} \\exists G\\subseteq P(F)\\times P(F) \\cup_{\\langle G,H\\rangle \\in G} (\\CES(G) \\cap(W \\setsub \\DES(H)))\\\\ = \\TS(p).\\end{align*}\\]\n\n\nP3 says that the following is true of every proposition \\(p\\) which\ncan be true: for every world where \\(p\\) is true, there are two sets\nof facts \\(G\\) and \\(H\\) such that (i) in \\(w\\), all members of \\(G\\)\nexist and none of \\(H\\) do, and (ii) in every world where this is the\ncase, \\(p\\) is true. That principle is rather ugly, but it does what\nit should do.\n\nP3 might be accepted by a proponent of theory \\(\\textrm{T}_1\\).\nConsider the following assumptions:\n\nAll propositions are Boolean compounds of propositions taken from\na special set, the set of atomic propositions;\nTo each atomic proposition \\(p\\) corresponds a fact \\(x\\) in \\(F\\)\nsuch that \\(\\ES(x) = \\TS(p)\\).\n\n\nA friend of \\(\\textrm{T}_1\\) may be willing to accept\nthem\u2014Wittgenstein (TLP) does\u2014and if he does, he\nwill thereby accept P3.\n\nEven the weak principle P3 faces some difficulties. Consider a true\nuniversal proposition, say the proposition that every finger of my\nright hand is less than 1m long. It seems that unless some\ncontroversial assumptions are made (like Wittgenstein\u2019s view\nthat universal propositions are conjunctions), to countenance P3\ninvolves accepting that there is something like the fact that every\nfinger of my right hand is less than 1m long and claiming that its\nexistence-set is identical to the truth-set of the proposition in\nquestion. Following Wittgenstein (TLP), many reject such\nuniversal facts. In the other camp are e.g., Russell (PLA)\nand Armstrong (1997; Armstrong invokes certain totality facts, which\nhave indeed a universal component.).\n\nThere is an alternative approach which escapes all the previous\ndifficulties. The idea is that facts make true certain basic\npropositions, and the truth-value of the remaining, more complex\npropositions is determined by the basic truths and the particular\ncontent of these propositions. This is the view put forward in\nWittgenstein TLP: the atomic facts make true the true atomic\npropositions, and whether a complex proposition (for him, a Boolean\ncombination of atomic propositions) is completely settled by what\nhappens at the atomic level. Views of that kind are rather attractive,\nsince they tend to favour parsimonious ontologies of facts. But they\nprove especially difficult to develop, especially when special\npropositions are taken into account, e.g., propositions involving\nmodal concepts.\n2.5 The Inner Structure of Facts\n\nThere is, as we have seen, an issue as to whether facts are complex\nentities or not, and as to how (if at all) the various facts are\ncomposed and as to what composition means here. (This question is not\nalways independent of the question whether propositions are complex.\nThis is obvious if facts are taken to be true propositions. But even\nif the identification is rejected, it may nevertheless be maintained\nthat facts share important features with propositions. On\npropositional complexity, see the entries on\n singular propositions\n and\n structured propositions.)\n\nThe view that there is an operation of negation, or conjunction, or\ndisjunction on facts is compatible with the claim that some facts are\ncomplex. For on a natural view, a conjunctive fact is literally\ncomposed by the facts of which it is a conjunction\u2014and similarly\nfor negation and disjunction. (Notice that admitting any two of the\nBoolean operations would then force one to accept that there are\nseveral ways in which the very same facts can combine in order to make\nup a fact.) Acceptance of some Boolean operations on facts is\ncompatible with taking facts to be complex, but it does not entail it:\none may accept, e.g., that a given fact is the conjunction of other\nfacts, and at the same time believe, say, that its depends for its\nidentity on them without having them as parts.\n\nThe issue of the complexity of facts also arises independently of\nissues of Boolean composition. It is a widespread view among the\nfriends of facts that certain facts are complex entities made up of\nobjects and properties or relations, and correspond to certain simple\npredications, at least in the sense that in every world, the\npredication is true if the fact obtains. Call such facts\nsubstantial facts, and that view Substantialism. We\nmay designate the substantial fact that objects \\(a_1 , \\ldots ,a_n\\)\nstand in relation \\(R\\) (in that order) by \u2018[\\(R\\); \\(a_1 ,\n\\ldots ,a_n\\)]\u2019. According to Substantialism, the sentence\n\u2018Socrates is mortal\u2019 corresponds in the previous sense to\na certain fact composed of Socrates and of the property of being\nmortal, namely [being mortal; Socrates], which obtains in a world only\nif in that world, Socrates exemplify the property of being mortal.\n(There may easily be disagreement about this very example, as indeed\nwith any particular example.) Substantialism is a form of what Fine\ncalls \u2018objectualism\u2019 (Fine 1982). Substantialist views are\nput forward in Russell PLA, Suszko 1968, Van Fraassen 1969,\nTaylor 1985, Armstrong 1997, and perhaps Wittgenstein TLP\n(\u2018perhaps\u2019, because it is not clear which kinds of objects\ncompose facts according to him).\n\nThe existence-conditions of a whole often depend upon facts about its\nparts. If there are disjunctive / conjunctive facts which contain the\ncorresponding disjuncts / conjuncts, then any such fact exists in a\nworld iff some disjuncts / all the conjuncts do. And if there is a\nnegative fact containing the corresponding negated item, the former\nfact exists in a world iff the latter does not. These\nexistence-conditions are written into the nature of the Boolean\noperations.\n\nWhen we come to substantial facts, things are not so straightforward.\nA comparison with sets may be useful. There is a view according to\nwhich the existence of a set requires that of its members: in a world\nwhere, say, Socrates exists but not Plato, the set [Socrates, Plato]\ndoes not exist. And there is the more liberal view which says that\nevery set exists necessarily. Corresponding to these two positions are\nthe following two views about facts:\n\nA substantial fact exists in a world iff in that world (i) the\nobjects have that property and (ii) the objects and the property\nexist;\nA substantial fact exists in a world iff in that world the objects\nhave that property.\n\n\nThe two views are identical if no objects can have a property unless\nthe objects and the property exist. Otherwise they are distinct.\nSuppose there is such a thing as the fact [being human; Socrates].\nBoth views can countenance such an object. But for the first the fact\nwill exist only in worlds where Socrates exists, while for the second\nit is sufficient that Socrates has the property of being human. And it\nmay be held that Socrates has the property in all possible worlds,\neven in those where he fails to exist. (Of course, there is a similar\nissue regarding the existence-conditions of facts across times.)\n\nIt is clear that this divergence potentially has dramatic consequences\nfor one\u2019s conception of the relationships between facts and\npropositions. Take for granted that it is necessary that Socrates is\nhuman, and that Socrates only contingently exists. Then a proponent of\nview (b), but not a proponent of view (a), can claim that the\nproposition that Socrates is human is true in a world iff [being\nhuman; Socrates] exists in that world.\n\nA substantialist may either deny or accept that there is an operation\nof conjunction on facts. If he accepts it, he will presumably view\nconjunctions of substantial facts as themselves complex entities (the\nopposite view would be very odd), doubly complex indeed, having a\nconjunctive structure and the conjuncts in turn having their own\ninternal composition. Similar considerations hold of disjunction and\nnegation.\n\nProponents of (a) are likely to deny that there is an operation of\nnegation on facts. For take the fact [being a philosopher; Socrates],\nand suppose there is a corresponding negation \\(x\\). Then as we saw,\nit would be odd to claim that \\(x\\) is not a complex fact, having\nSocrates as a component. Suppose \\(x\\) has such a complexity. Now take\ntwo worlds \\(w\\) and \\(v\\), such that in \\(w\\) Socrates exists but is\nnot a philosopher, and in \\(v\\), Socrates does not exist (and so is\nnot a philosopher either). Then in both worlds, the proposition that\nSocrates is not a philosopher is true. And according to a proponent of\nview (a), \\(x\\) exists in \\(w\\) but not in \\(v\\). The outcome is\nrather odd. Similar considerations hold of disjunction, but not of\nconjunction.\n\nSo far we have considered two types of complexity facts may have:\nBoolean complexity (which in turn divides into the various types\ncorresponding to the various Boolean operations) and the complexity of\nsubstantial facts. But there are many other types of complexity one\nmay take facts to have. Think of universal facts (the fact that all\nmen have a brain), modal facts (the fact that it is possible that\nSocrates is a football player), and so on.\n\nThe identity-conditions of a whole often depends upon facts about its\nparts. When are two substantial facts \\([R; a, b]\\) and \\([S; c, d]\\)\nidentical? A plausible answer is: when \\(R = S, a = c\\) and \\(b = d\\).\nThis answer has consequences for a friend of Modal Criterion.\nAccepting both the proposed identity-condition and Modal\nCriterion, one cannot claim that there are distinct but\nnecessarily coextensive properties (which are part of some facts), or\nthat the facts [being human; Socrates] and [having a human member;\n[Socrates]] are distinct, even on the plausible assumption that they\nexist in the very same worlds.",
