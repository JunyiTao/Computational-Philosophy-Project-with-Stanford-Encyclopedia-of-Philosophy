    "main_text": "Criticisms || The Threat of Skepticism\n7.3 The Threat of Skepticism\n\nAlthough it is not always offered explicitly as an argument, many no\ndoubt reject the acquaintance theorist\u2019s account of both\nnoninferential and inferential knowledge out of fear that the account\nwill inevitably lead to a radical skepticism. If knowledge by\nacquaintance is restricted to belief in propositions where one\u2019s\nepistemic situation precludes the possibility of error, critics might\nwell be right in suggesting that we have a tiny body of knowledge\nsecured by direct acquaintance. The rest of what we know or\njustifiably believe must be secured by inference, and the fear is that\nwe simply don\u2019t have anything like the inferential resources to\nget from such a narrow base to commonsense beliefs about the world\naround us. Even if we allow for some fallible foundational beliefs, as\nmany contemporary acquaintance theorists do (see\n section 6),\n one might still worry that the class of facts with which we are\nacquainted do not constitute a very impressive base. How legitimate\nthat fear is depends very much on the analysis of inferential\nknowledge one accepts. If one requires access to probabilistic or\nexplanatory connections as a condition for inferential knowledge, then\nunless one can be acquainted with such connections holding between\npropositions, skepticism does, indeed, loom on the horizon. A number\nof acquaintance theorists are more optimistic, however, that\nskepticism regarding the external world can be avoided (see McGrew\n1995; Moser 1989; BonJour 2003; and Hasan 2018).\n\nEven should it be true that the classical foundationalist has a view\nthat invites skepticism, it should, perhaps, be an open question as to\nwhether that constitutes a legitimate objection to the view. Classical\nfoundationalists are likely to deny that skeptical implications of a\ntheory of justification generally or automatically discredit it. Even\nif we don\u2019t have good grounds for many of our beliefs, including\nbeliefs regarding the external world, it may be that we need good\ngrounds to be justified and we do not have them. The skeptical\nimplication may be correct rather than objectionable. \n",
