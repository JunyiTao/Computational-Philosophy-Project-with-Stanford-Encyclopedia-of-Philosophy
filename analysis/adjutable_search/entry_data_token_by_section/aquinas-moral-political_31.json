Even when its subjects or some of them\nwould have made or preferred a different determinatio, a\ndifferent way of pursuing communal benefit, the rulers\u2019 intent\nto promote common good supports and is supported by their claim to\nrulership. Only if they have such intent can they instantiate the\ncentral case of government.\n7.2.1 The Rule of Law\n\nThe central case of government is the rule of a free people, and law\nis centrally instantiated when its fully public character\n(promulgation: q. 90 a. 4), and its clarity (q. 95 a.3), generality\n(q. 96 a. 1), stability (q. 97 a. 2), and practicability (q. 95 a. 3),\nenable government (law-makers and law-maintainers alike) and subjects\nto be partners in public reason (Aquinas has the concept\nthough not the phrase). The features of law thus itemized by Aquinas\namount to the concept of the Rule of Law, which he clearly gives a\npriority over the \u201crule of men\u201d in his treatment of\njudges\u2019 subordination to legislation and of the duty of judges\nto adhere to law even against the evidence of their own eyes (when\nthat evidence is not legally admissible): II-II q. 67 a. 2; q. 64 a. 6\nad 3.\n",
