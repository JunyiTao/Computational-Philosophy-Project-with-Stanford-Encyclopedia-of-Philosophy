    "main_text": "Quantum Randomness\n9. Quantum Randomness\n\nAccording to the quantum formalism, for a system with wave function\n\\(\\psi\\) the probability density for finding its configuration to be\n\\(q\\) is \\(\\lvert\\psi(q)\\rvert^2\\). To the extent that the results of\nmeasurement are registered configurationally, at least potentially, it\nfollows that the predictions of Bohmian mechanics for the results of\nmeasurement must agree with those of orthodox quantum theory (assuming\nthe same Schr\u00f6dinger equation for both) provided that it is\nsomehow true for Bohmian mechanics that configurations are random,\nwith distribution given by the quantum equilibrium\ndistribution \\(\\lvert\\psi(q)\\rvert^2\\). Now the status and\njustification of this quantum equilibrium hypothesis is a\nrather delicate matter, one that has been explored in considerable\ndetail (D\u00fcrr, Goldstein, & Zangh\u00ec 1992a). Here are a\nfew relevant points.\n\nIt is nowadays a rather familiar fact that dynamical systems quite\ngenerally give rise to behavior of a statistical character, with the\nstatistics given by the (or a) stationary probability distribution for\nthe dynamics. So it is with Bohmian mechanics, except that for the\nBohmian system stationarity is not quite the right concept. Rather it\nis the notion of equivariance that is relevant. A probability\ndistribution on configuration space \\(\\varrho^{\\psi}\\), depending upon\nthe wave function \\(\\psi\\), is equivariant if \n\n\\[(\\varrho^{\\psi})_t = \\varrho^{\\psi_t}\\]\n\nwhere the dependence on \\(t\\) on the right arises from\nSchr\u00f6dinger\u2019s equation and on the left from the evolution\non probability distributions arising from the flow that\n the guiding equation\n induces. Thus equivariance expresses the mutual compatibility,\nrelative to \\(\\varrho^{\\psi}\\), of the Schr\u00f6dinger evolution of\nthe wave function and the Bohmian motion of the configuration. It is\nan immediate consequence of\n the guiding equation\n and the quantum continuity equation that \\(\\varrho^{\\psi} =\n\\lvert\\psi(q)\\rvert^2\\) is equivariant. (It can be shown in fact that\nthis is more or less the only equivariant possibility that is suitably\nlocal (Goldstein & Struyve 2007).)\n\nIn trying to understand the status in Bohmian mechanics of the quantum\nequilibrium distribution, it is perhaps helpful to think of\n\n\nquantum equilibrium, \\(\\varrho = \\lvert\\psi \\rvert^2\\)\n\n\nas roughly analogous to (classical) \n\n\nthermodynamic equilibrium, \\(\\varrho = \\textrm{exp} (-H/kT)\n/Z\\),\n\n\nthe probability distribution of the phase-space point of a system in\nequilibrium at temperature \\(T\\). (\\(Z\\) is a normalization constant\ncalled the partition function and \\(k\\) is Boltzmann\u2019s\nconstant.) This analogy has several facets: In both cases the\nprobability distributions are naturally associated with their\nrespective dynamical systems. In particular, these distributions are\nstationary or, what amounts to the same thing within the framework of\nBohmian mechanics, equivariant. In both cases it seems natural to try\nto justify these equilibrium distributions by means of mixing-type,\nconvergence-to-equilibrium arguments (Bohm 1953; Valentini &\nWestman 2005). It has been argued, however, that in both cases the\nultimate justification for these probability distributions must be in\nterms of statistical patterns exhibited by ensembles of actual\nsubsystems within a typical individual universe (Bell 1981b,\nreprinted 1987c: 129; D\u00fcrr, Goldstein, & Zangh\u00ec\n1992a). And in both cases the status of, and justification for,\nequilibrium distributions remains controversial (D\u00fcrr &\nStruyve 2020; see also Goldstein 2012). \n\nIt can nonetheless be shown (D\u00fcrr, Goldstein, & Zangh\u00ec\n1992a) that probabilities for positions given by the quantum\nequilibrium distribution emerge naturally from an analysis of\n\u201cequilibrium\u201d for the deterministic dynamical system that\nBohmian mechanics defines\u2014in much the same manner that the\nMaxwellian velocity distribution emerges from an analysis of classical\nthermodynamic equilibrium. (For more on the thermodynamic side of the\nanalogy see Goldstein 2001.) Thus with Bohmian mechanics the\nstatistical description in quantum theory indeed takes, as Einstein\nanticipated, \u201can approximately analogous position to the\nstatistical mechanics within the framework of classical\nmechanics\u201d.\n\nIt is also perhaps\nworth noting that the typicality-grounded account of quantum\nrandomness in Bohmian mechanics is extremely similar to\nEverett\u2019s account (Everett 1957) of quantum randomness for\n\u201cmany worlds\u201d, despite the huge metaphysical differences\nthat exist between these two versions of quantum theory.\n",
