    "main_text": "Metaphysics\n2. Metaphysics\n\nDesgabets has been variously described as an \u201corthodox\nCartesian\u201d for the fidelity with which he defended Descartes\nagainst his critics (Watson, 1966; 1987), and a \u201cradical\nCartesian\u201d for the originality of his ideas in the development\nof the Cartesian philosophy (Schmaltz, 2002; Adriaenssen, 2015). On\nthe side of orthodoxy, we can see Desgabets\u2019s adoption of the\nnew Cartesian philosophy in his adherence to the core Cartesian\nmetaphysics of dualism, mechanism, and union, and his various\ncritiques of Scholastic doctrines. On the side of radicalism,\nDesgabets took up arguments and ideas that would be difficult if not\nimpossible to reconcile with Descartes\u2019s published philosophy.\nThere is Desgabets\u2019s argument that the body is essential for all\noperations of the human mind making innate ideas impossible, his\ndefense of the intentionality principle, and his controversial\ndoctrine of indefectibility especially with respect to matter, and his\nunorthodox defense of the \u201cCreation Doctrine.\u201d Notably, as\nMalfara and Lennon have argued, there is Desgabets\u2019s development\nof the metaphysics of matter in the Eucharist controversy, which\nserves as a fascinating philosophical and theological litmus test for\nDesgabets\u2019s Radical Cartesianism (Malfara & Lennon,\n2023)\n\nDesgabets subscribed completely to the Cartesian doctrine of matter as\na substance extended in length, width, and breadth. It was posited\nagainst the prevailing Peripatetic view that posits prime matter and\nsubstantial forms in order to explain the permanence underlying the\ncontinuous change matter undergoes. On Descartes\u2019s view, the\nessence of matter is its extension in three dimensions, and all of its\nchanging attributes, properties and modes, such as movement, rest,\nfigure, situation and composition of parts, are completely dependent\nupon and follow from this unified extension (OPD 2, 27). Matter, or\ncorporeal substance, is clearly known when it is viewed as the\ngeometrical object of mathematicians, as a magnitude extended in\nlength, width and breadth. Likewise, corporeal bodies are best viewed\nas the movements, rest, figures, arrangements and sizes of which\ncorporeal substance is capable, and which, in its various\nconfigurations and assemblages, \u201c\u2026 now pass for the form\nof all particular bodies of which the world is composed\u201d (OPD 1,\n3). And, in all of this, \u201c\u2026 there is nothing which is not\ngoverned by the laws of mechanics\u201d (OPD 2, 4).\n\nFurthermore, Desgabets viewed bodies as portions or divisions of\nmatter, which in the case of animals are highly delicate and organized\nmachines composed of an infinite number of parts capable of an\ninfinite diversity of movements. He held this view against that of the\nPeripatetics who believed that there must be an internal principle of\nthought in beasts because of the intricacy and apparent human-like\nintelligence of their movements. According to Desgabets, the kind of\nthinking that attributes such an internal principle to beasts is the\nsame kind of thinking that results in the attribution of intelligence\nto clocks, \u201cHowever, the same affront to reason and philosophy\nis committed by the Americans and the Barbarians of the Orient who not\nbeing able to understand the mechanical reasons for the movement of\nclocks, or the true causes of natural effects, attribute souls and\nintelligence to machines, and likewise to fire, lakes etc., and in\ndoing so expose themselves to the mockery of Europeans\u201d (OPD 4,\n132\u2013133). In other words, no appeal to internal principles, or\nfinal causes is required to explain the movements of beasts, any more\nthan it is needed to explain the movements of clocks. The complexity\nof movements, whether involved in the operations of clocks or those of\nanimate bodies, is explicable in purely mechanistic terms.\n\nLikewise, all motions communicated within or between material bodies\nare effected by physical contact and proceed according to the laws of\nlocal motion. Desgabets was careful to emphasize that the ultimate\nsource of movement is not matter but God, who imparted motion to the\nuniverse in its creation. For Desgabets, it is this fact that grounds\nthe laws of nature: \u201cIt is the constant and uniform manner of\nthe action of God which founds these laws, by means of which He forms\nand maintains this beautiful harmony in the world which is one of the\ngreatest objects of our sciences\u201d (OPD 1, 13). As Desgabets saw\nit, the operation of these laws of nature and the rules of the\ncommunication of movement were the true and unique foundations of the\nnew physics.\n\nDesgabets also subscribed to the Cartesian conception of mind as an\nimmaterial substance whose essence is thought. The distinction between\nmind and matter is thus a real and substantial one, impossible not to\nperceive: \u201cNever has an infant asked for lies or truths for\nbreakfast, nor has he imagined that the stones encountered along his\npath were the gross thoughts of some countryman\u201d (OPD 5, 197).\nMinds, or immaterial substances, are of three kinds: uncreated, which\nis God; mind detached from body, which is an angel; and mind united to\norganized body, which is a reasonable soul. The second of these,\nangels, are the only pure minds in the created universe and they have\nno corporeal extension, no local presence or correspondence to\ntime\u2014they are simple and indivisible minds. Such minds or\nspirits cannot be perfected by any substantial union since their\nspecific spiritual being does not require anything corporeal to carry\nout its functions. However, they are capable of participating in the\nmovements of the visible world, though in doing so, they must undergo\na kind of degradation and punishment in order to receive pain. The\nthird of these spiritual beings is man, who consists of a cross\nbetween purely intellectual and purely corporeal things. In this\nDesgabets appears to have strayed slightly from the official Cartesian\ndoctrine of dual substances, since he claimed that outside of God\nthere are three sorts of simple created substances, matter or body,\nangel, and one which is composed of body and soul, which is man.\nHowever, this tripartite division of substances is supported by a more\nfundamental bipartite division of material and spiritual substances,\nso that strictly speaking, individual bodies and individual persons\nare best understood as modal beings not substances. This is\nnot unlike Descartes\u2019s account of man as a \u201ccomposite\nentity\u201d possessing two principal attributes, namely extension\nand thought, a being which itself is not a simple substance.\nNonetheless, in Desgabets as in Descartes, how to interpret the human\nsoul as a substance (Miller, 2008), or as a modal being (Lennon,\n1994), is a matter of continued debate.\n\nIt was an important point for Desgabets that man, unlike angels, is a\nbeing composed of body and soul, who continually experiences\nthe union of the two substances by the endless impressions he finds in\nhimself. The relation of mind and body in man is an essential one\nwhich must not be regarded as a penal state of the soul, but as the\naccomplishment of its natural perfection. Human thought has\nduration, succession, a beginning and an end\u2014qualities that\ndepend on the movements of the corporeal organs and which follow the\nrules of local movement. Although Descartes and Malebranche after him\nclaimed that the human mind is capable of detachment from the body,\nDesgabets rejected this, since the human mind is not like an\nangel\u2019s but requires continual commerce with the body and its\nsenses for all its operations.\n\nOne further issue concerning Descartes\u2019s general account of the\nnature of the mind-body union, which Desgabets raised in order to\ndispel, concerns the common complaint that the Cartesian view fails to\naccount for the interaction of material and immaterial substances.\nDesgabets did not regard this as a true problem because he thought\nthat the question demanded the impossible\u2014an explanation of how\nthe organized body and reasonable soul, which are in fact made for\neach other, can exercise a mutual commerce. He likened this\nto asking an artisan to explain how the convex surface of a peg\ncan possibly fill that of a concave hole. It is akin to\nasking why extension is the essence of body, or why thought is the\nessence of mind. It\u2019s just the way God made the world.\n\nWhat could be explained, according to Desgabets, is the way in which\nthe mind and body are in fact united and dependent upon one another.\nHe found an analogue in the nature of the body-body relation: two\nbodies are united when their superficies touch and their movements\ntake on a mutual dependence. Similarly, two minds are united when\ntheir thoughts and wills agree and depend on one another. The union of\nmind and body is not by touch, nor by agreement of thoughts, but by\nthe dependence that exists between certain thoughts and certain\nmovements such that one in fact follows from the other. The\nunion of the mind and body in man is so strict that it founds a\nspecies of communication for their commerce, in virtue of which our\nthoughts are said to have duration, succession, etc., without\nthemselves being corporeal. The union and its interaction cannot be\nfurther reduced in explanation. In short, the essence of man, who is\ncomposed of mind and body, is the union of mind and body, and\nthe only legitimate questions which concern this union relate to how,\ngiven the union, the mind determines the body and the body\ndetermines the mind, which is an empirical question, known through\nexperience not reason.\n\nDesgabets\u2019s thesis concerning the indefectibility of created\nsubstances, which underlies his metaphysics, is perhaps his most\noriginal if not radical philosophical contribution (Schmaltz, 2002;\nEaston, 2005; Gatto, 2017). Gatto argues that this thesis is the key\nto understanding Desgabets\u2019s peculiar development of\nDescartes\u2019s philosophy (Gatto, 2017). In a letter from Desgabets\nto Malebranche, we learn that he had begun the Treatise on the\nIndefectibility of Substances, as early as 1649 (Letter from\nDesgabets, Sept. 1674, Malebranche, 1958\u201384, vol. II: 85). It\nwas Desgabets\u2019s view that substances, in their essence and\nexistence, are eternal, indivisible, immutable, and indestructible,\nwhich is to say, indefectible. While the modes of substance can\nundergo change, the essence of substance and its existence cannot.\nAccording to Desgabets, the indestructibility, eternality, and\nindivisibility of substances follow from the fact that God created\nsubstances by a free and indifferent will. Once the world was created,\nit could not be uncreated. Thus, the key to understanding\nDesgabets\u2019s indefectibility thesis lies not only in his analysis\nof the Cartesian doctrine of substance, but in his interpretation of\nDescartes\u2019s notoriously opaque doctrine of the free creation of\nthe eternal truths, discussed in a later section, under\n\u201cTruth.\u201d\n\nAs we have seen, Desgabets\u2019s adoption of the new Cartesian\nphilosophy came with radical revisions that Descartes himself likely\nwould not have sanctioned. As Desgabets himself puts it in Preface to\nthe Supplement, Descartes made the true philosophy possible:\n\n\n\nI will again affirm that we need only look at the works of Descartes\nto speak thoroughly of these four great subjects I have just proposed.\nHe raised them all with the purpose of treating them and had views so\nextensive concerning them that we cannot fail to profit notably from\nhis work, if we take the trouble to examine his ideas. Nonetheless, I\nmust show in what follows that after delivering us from infinite\nerror, he himself was caught in imperceptible prejudices concerning\nfundamental things, which deprived the world of the greatest fruits of\nhis work. I will take the occasion of his own inventions to mark the\nplaces where he failed and to extend them as far as he should have. I\nwill uncover the contrarieties that are found among the things he\nadvanced and how sometimes he himself ceased to be a good Cartesian,\nby abandoning his finest discoveries to embrace popular opinions. I\nwill show that it is almost by his own doctrine that the errors are\ncorrected and that it is he who gives the remedy for the ill he\nproduced. I will establish his reputation upon eternal foundations by\ngiving his philosophy its expected reputation. For, it has to be known\nthat his philosophy, once purged of certain errors and having received\nthe vast scope possible to it, must pass for the masterpiece of the\nhuman spirit, and for what is the greatest of its kind in the world\n(OPD 5, 152).\n\n",
