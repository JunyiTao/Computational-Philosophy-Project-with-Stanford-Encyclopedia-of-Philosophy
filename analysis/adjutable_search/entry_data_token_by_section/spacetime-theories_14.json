    "main_text": "The Dynamical Approach || The Dynamical Approach and General Relativity\n5. Conclusion\n\nThis entry, and its companion on\n classical theories,\n have been concerned with tracing the history and philosophy of\n\u2018absolute\u2019 and \u2018relative\u2019 theories of space\nand motion. Along the way we have been at pains to introduce some\nclear terminology for various different concepts (e.g.,\n\u2018true\u2019 motion, \u2018substantivalism\u2019,\n\u2018absolute space\u2019), but what we have not really done is say\nwhat the difference between absolute and relative space and\nmotion is: just what is at stake? Rynasiewicz (2000) argued that there\nsimply are no constant issues running through the history from\nantiquity through general relativity theory; that there is no stable\nmeaning for either \u2018absolute motion\u2019 or \u2018relative\nmotion\u2019 (or \u2018substantival space\u2019 vs\n\u2018relational space\u2019). While we agree to a certain extent,\nwe think that nevertheless there are a series of issues that have\nmotivated thinkers again and again. Rynasiewicz is probably right that\nthe issues cannot be expressed in formally precise terms, but that\ndoes not mean that there are no looser philosophical affinities that\nshed useful light on the history and on current theorizing.\n\nOur discussion has revealed several different issues, of which we will\nhighlight three as components of the \u2018absolute-relative\ndebate\u2019. (i) There is the question of whether all motions and\nall possible descriptions of motions are equal, or whether some are\n\u2018real\u2019 \u2013 what we have called, in Seventeenth Century\nparlance, \u2018true\u2019. There is a natural temptation for those\nwho hold that there is \u2018nothing but the relative positions and\nmotions between bodies\u2019 to add \u2018and all such motions are\nequal\u2019, thus denying the existence of true motion. However,\narguably \u2013 perhaps surprisingly \u2013 no one we have discussed\nhas unreservedly held this view (at least not consistently): Descartes\nconsidered motion \u2018properly speaking\u2019 to be privileged,\nLeibniz introduced \u2018active force\u2019 to ground motion\n(arguably in his mechanics as well as metaphysically), and\nMach\u2019s view seems to be that the distribution of matter in the\nuniverse determines a preferred standard of inertial motion. In\ngeneral relativity there is a well-defined distinction between\ninertial and accelerated motion, given by the spacetime metric, but\nEinstein initially hoped that the metric itself would be determined in\nturn by relative locations and motions of the matter distribution in\nspacetime.\n\nThat is, relationists can allow \u2018true\u2019 motions if they\noffer an analysis of them in terms of the relations between bodies.\nGiven this logical point, we are led to the second question: (ii) is\ntrue motion definable in terms of relations or not? (And if one hopes\nto give an affirmative answer, what kinds of relations are acceptable\nto use in the reductive definition?) It seems reasonable to call this\nthe issue of whether motion is absolute or relative.\nDescartes and Mach were relationists about motion in this sense, while\nNewton was an absolutist. In the case of Einstein and GTR we linked\nrelational motion to the satisfaction of Mach\u2019s Principle, just\nas Einstein did in the early years of the theory. Despite some\npromising features displayed by GTR, and certain of its models, we saw\nthat Mach\u2019s Principle is certainly not fully satisfied in GTR as\na whole. We also noted that in the absence of absolute simultaneity,\nit becomes an open question what relations are to be permitted in the\ndefinition (or supervience base) \u2013 spacetime interval relations?\nInstantaneous spatial distances and velocities on a 3-d hypersurface?\nThe shape dynamics program comes at this question from a new\nperspective, starting with momentary slices of space (with or without\nmatter contents) which are given a strongly relational \u2013 as\nopposed to absolute \u2013 interpretation. However, we argued that it\nultimately remains unclear whether this approach vindicates\nMach\u2019s Principle.\n\nThe final issue we have discussed in this article is that of (iii)\nwhether spacetime structures are substantial entities in their own\nright, metaphysically speaking not grounded on facts about dynamical\nlaws, or whether instead it is best to think of the reality of\nspacetime structures as dependent upon, and explained by, facts about\nthe world\u2019s dynamical laws, as advocates of the dynamical\napproach maintain. The debate here is not the same as that between\nclassical relationism and substantivalism, although there are clear\naffinities between the dynamical approach and classical relationism.\nWe explored how this issue takes quite different forms in the context\nof special relativistic (Lorentz covariant) physical theories and in\nthe context of general relativistic theories.\n",
