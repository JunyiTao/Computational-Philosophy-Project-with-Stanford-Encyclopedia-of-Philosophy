    "main_text": "Politics and Ethics\n5. Politics and Ethics\n\nSuhrawardi\u2019s Philosophy of Illumination carries a\npolitical dimension. Ziai (1992) provides an overview of what he calls\nhis \u2018Illuminationist political doctrine\u2019: it establishes a\nconnection between political authority, just rule, and the\nruler\u2019s access to divine light. For instance, in Tablets to\n\u2018Imad (Suh. 1993c, 186\u20138 [Pers.]), Suhrawardi\nintroduces two Zoroastrian terms kharrah (xwarrah)\nand farrah (Avesta/Pahlavi) to allude to the divine/regal\nlight that was bestowed upon ancient kings; in the Book of\nRadiance, it is the Light of Lights that bestows upon them\nluminous glory and power (kharra-yi kayani) (Suh. 1998,\n84\u20135, cf. 1993c, 81; Gnoli 1999); and in the Philosophy of\nIllumination, it corresponds to the light of the Kingdom of Power\n(malakut) that Kay Khusraw and Zarathustra were able to\nbehold (PI, \u00a7\u00a7165\u20136; cf. 1993a, 502\u20135).\n\n\nThis political \u2018doctrines\u2019 provides indications of the\nconditions able to guarantee the reign of the just rule, thus\nproviding elements of an Illuminationist political ethic of the\nSage-ruler. However, the general framework of the ethics underlying\nSuhrawardi\u2019s ishraqi system requires further\ninvestigation. His particularly Platonic understanding of the mystic\nqua ruler and his political role, coupled with the role of intuitive\nor \u2018mystical\u2019 access to the \u2018divine\u2019 lights by\nprophets, mystics and sages might, however, not leave Suhrawardi\nimmune to the same criticism Popper leveled against Plato. \n\nSuhrawardi may, in fact, appeal to a somewhat\n\u2018mythological\u2019 genealogy of the transmission of ancient\nIllumination/ishraqi philosophies from the Greek/West and the\nIranian/East which he claims to revive. Ziai (1992, 337; cf. Walbridge\n2000, 201\u201310) speculates that he tried to put into practice the\npolitical dimension (i.e. a \u2018new\u2019 political doctrine) of\nhis ishraqi philosophy, based mainly on passages from his\nworks and considering the possible circumstances of his demise and\nexecution. Historical data supporting the thesis, Suhrawardi\u2019s\nrelationship with his many patrons and the purpose of passages\nrelating to these Illuminationist political doctrines need further\nexamination to confirm the claim (Marcotte 2001a, 415\u20136). \n\nSuhrawardi\u2019s eschatology \u2014 the Return \u2014 and his\ndiscussions on the fate of the soul in the afterlife offers a glimpse\nof what might constitute a \u2018good\u2019 and ethical life in this\nworld. In line with Avicenna\u2019s classification of souls in the\nhereafter according to their worldly acquisition of practical and\ntheoretical knowledge, the moral qualities developed in this life\ndetermine the fate of souls in the afterlife (PI,\n\u00a7\u00a7244\u20138). In search of felicity, souls must attempt to\ndetach themselves from their tenebrous bodies and all that is worldly\nand material and seek to access the world of immaterial lights. Souls\nengrossed in matter in this life partially determine their fate in the\nafterlife. In this respect, Suhrawardi does not depart greatly from\nAvicenna\u2019s Peripatetic eschatology (see 4.3). \n\nProphets, saints and exceptionally gifted mystics are the ones best\nable to achieve conjunction with the world of pure lights. Ascetic\npractices in this life can become a means to attain self-consciousness\nof the ontic light reality of the soul. Some of Suhrawardi\u2019s\nallegorical and mystical treatises, like The Treatise of the\nBird, A Tale of Occidental Exile or A Day with a\nGroup of Sufis (Suh. 1993b, 274\u201397, 1999b, 2001, 1976),\nprovide examples of the pedagogical role and instruction of the guide\nfigure, of the Lord of the human species, or of spiritual entities to\nthe novice in his or her quest for the immaterial world of lights in\nwhich salvation lies. The posthumous life of individual souls and\ntheir ability to perceive the promised other-worldly rewards and\npunishments become conditions for divine retribution. \n",
