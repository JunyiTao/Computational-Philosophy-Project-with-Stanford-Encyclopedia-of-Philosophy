The Search for \u201cRock Bottom\u201d Explanations\n\n\nFor many years, the term methodological individualism was associated\nprimarily with the work of Karl Popper. This is due to the extensive\ndebate triggered by Popper\u2019s papers, \u201cThe Poverty of\nHistoricism\u201d (1944/45), and later his book, The Open Society\nand Its Enemies (1945). Popper, however, although making use of\nthe term, did little to defend his commitment to it. Instead he left\nthis job to his former student, J.W.N. Watkins. It was this debate\nbetween Watkins and his critics that (perhaps unfairly) solidified the\nassociation in many people\u2019s minds between Popper and methodological\nindividualism. (It was also this debate that brought the doctrine to\nthe widespread attention of philosophers.)\n\n\nUnfortunately, the version of methodological individualism that Popper\nbequeathed to his student Watkins was considerably more difficult to\ndefend than the one he inherited from Hayek. Since the beginning, the\nprecepts of methodological individualism were thought to have been\nimposed by the special requirements of the social sciences.  For both\nWeber and Hayek, it was the reflection of a key difference between the\nGeisteswissenschaften and the\nNaturwissenschaften. Popper, however, denies that there are\nany significant methodological differences between the two. Indeed,\nhis initial discussion of methodological individualism in \u201cThe\nPoverty of Historicism,\u201d occurs in a section called \u201cThe\nUnity of Method,\u201d in which he claims that both are simply in the\nbusiness of \u201ccausal explanation, prediction and\ntesting.\u201d(1945, 78). He goes on to deny that\n\u201cunderstanding\u201d plays any special role in the social\nsciences.\n\n\nThe problem that this creates for the doctrine of methodological\nindividualism is readily apparent. A social science that aims at\ninterpretation, or that uses interpretation as part of the centerpiece\nof its explanatory strategy, has a very clear methodological reason\nfor privileging explanations that refer to individual actions \u2013\nsince it is precisely the underlying intentional states that serve as\nthe object of interpretation. But if social scientists are merely in\nthe business of providing causal explanations, just like natural\nscientists, then what is the rationale for privileging individual\nactions in these explanations? There no longer appears to be any\nmethodological reason for doing so.  Thus critics like Leon\nGoldstein (1958), and later Steven Lukes (1968), would argue that\nmethodological individualism was actually just an oblique way of\nasserting a commitment to metaphysical or ontological\nindividualism. In other words, Popper\u2019s \u201cmethodological\nindividualism\u201d was actually a claim about what the world\n\u201creally\u201d consisted of, little more than a fancy way of\nsaying \u201cthere is no such thing as society.\u201d Watkins went\non to reinforce this impression by reformulating the thesis as the\nclaim that the \u201cultimate constituents of the social world are\nindividual people\u201d (1957, 105).\n\n\nWatkins also provoked doubts about the methodological status of the\nprinciple by distinguishing between \u201cunfinished or half-way\nexplanations\u201d of social phenomena, which might not specify an\naction-theoretic or individualistic mechanism, and so-called\n\u201crock-bottom explanations,\u201d which would (1957, 106). Yet\nin so doing, he grants that these half-way explanations (the example\nhe gives is the relationship between inflation and the unemployment\nrate), while they may not tell us everything we would like to know,\nneed not be meaningless or false. This creates problems, as Lars Udehn\npoints out, since the mere fact that one can explain social\nphenomena in terms of individuals \u201cdoes not imply the\nmethodological rule that they should be explained this way\u201d\n(2001, 216) \u2013 especially not if the \u201chalf-way\u201d\nknowledge obtained is sufficient for our (extra-scientific)\npurposes.\n\n\nFinally, it should be noted that Popper introduced a contrast between\nmethodological individualism and \u201cpsychologism,\u201d viz., the\nview that \u201call laws of social life must be ultimately reducible\nto the psychological laws of \u2018human nature\u2019\u201d(1945,\n89).  Nevertheless, in Popper\u2019s formulation, methodological\nindividualism does appear equivalent to at least some form of\npsychological reductionism. At very least, his formulation \u2013 and\nlater Watkins\u2019s \u2013 left many commentators confused about how one\ncould affirm the former without committing to the latter (Udehn 2001,\n204). More generally, it created a great deal of confusion about the difference between methodological individualism and atomism (Hodgson 2007, 214).\n",
