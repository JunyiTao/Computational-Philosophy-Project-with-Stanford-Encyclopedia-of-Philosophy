    "main_text": "\n\nMaking judgments about whether a person is morally responsible for her\nbehavior, and holding others and ourselves responsible for actions and\nthe consequences of actions, is a fundamental and familiar part of our\nmoral practices and our interpersonal relationships.\n\nThe judgment that a person is morally responsible for her behavior\ninvolves\u2014at least to a first approximation\u2014attributing\ncertain powers and capacities to that person, and viewing her behavior\nas arising (in the right way) from the fact that the person has, and\nhas exercised, these powers and capacities. Whatever the correct\naccount of the powers and capacities at issue (and canvassing\ndifferent accounts is the task of this entry), their possession\nqualifies an agent as morally responsible in a general sense: that is,\nas one who may be morally responsible for particular exercises of\nagency. Normal adult human beings may possess the powers and\ncapacities in question, and non-human animals, very young children,\nand those suffering from severe developmental disabilities or dementia\n(to give a few examples) are generally taken to lack them. \n\nTo hold someone responsible involves\u2014again, to a first\napproximation\u2014responding to that person in ways that are made\nappropriate by the judgment that she is morally responsible. These\nresponses often constitute instances of moral praise or moral blame\n(though there may be reason to allow for morally responsible behavior\nthat is neither praiseworthy nor blameworthy: see McKenna 2012:\n16\u201317 and M. Zimmerman 1988: 61\u201362). Blame is a response\nthat may follow on the judgment that a person is morally responsible\nfor behavior that is wrong or bad, and praise is a response that may\nfollow on the judgment that a person is morally responsible for\nbehavior that is right or good.\n\nIt should be noted at the outset that the above schema, while useful,\nmay be misleading in certain respects. For one thing, it suggests a\ncorrespondence and symmetry between praise and blame that may not\nexist. The two are certainly asymmetrical insofar as the attention\ngiven to blame far exceeds that given to praise. One reason for this\nis that blameworthiness, unlike praiseworthiness, is often taken to\ninvolve liability to a sanction. Thus, articulating the conditions of\nblameworthiness may seem to theorists the more pressing matter.\nPerhaps for related reasons, there is a richer language for expressing\nblame than praise (Watson 1996 [2004: 283]), and \u201cblame\u201d\nfinds its way into idioms for which there is no ready parallel\nemploying \u201cpraise\u201d: compare \u201cS is to\nblame for x\u201d and \u201cS is to\npraise for x\u201d. Note, as well, that \u201cholding\nresponsible\u201d is itself not a neutral expression: it typically\narises in blaming contexts (Watson 1996 [2004: 284]). Additionally,\nthere may be asymmetries in the contexts in which praise and blame are\nappropriate: private blame is a more familiar phenomenon than private\npraise (Coates & Tognazzini 2013a), and while minor wrongs may\nreasonably earn blame, minimally decent behavior often seems\ninsufficient for praise (see Eshleman 2014 for this and other\ndifferences between praise and blame). Finally, the widespread\nassumption that praiseworthiness and blameworthiness are at least\nsymmetrical in terms of the capacities they require has also been\nquestioned (Nelkin 2008, 2011; Wolf 1980, 1990). Like most work on\nmoral responsibility, this entry will tend to focus on the negative\nside of the phenomenon; for more, see the\n entry on blame.\n\nA few other general observations about the concept of moral\nresponsibility are in order before introducing particular conceptions\nof it. In everyday speech, one often hears references to\npeople\u2019s \u201cmoral responsibility\u201d where the point is\nto indicate that a person has some duty or obligation\u2014some\nresponsibility\u2014to which that person is required, by\nsome standard, to attend. In this sense, we say, for example, that a\nlawyer has a responsibility (to behave in certain ways, according to\ncertain standards) to his client. This entry, however, is concerned\nnot with accounts that specify people\u2019s responsibilities in the\nsense of duties and obligations, but rather with accounts of whether a\nperson bears the right relation to her own actions, and their\nconsequences, so as to be properly held accountable for them.\n(Unfortunately, this entry does not include discussion of some\nimportant topics related to moral responsibility, such as\nresponsibility for omissions (see Clarke 2014, Fischer &\nRavizza 1998, and Nelkin & Rickless 2017a) or collective\nresponsibility (see the\n entry on collective responsibility\n and Volumes 30 and 38 of Midwest Studies in Philosophy).\n\nMoral responsibility should also be distinguished from causal\nresponsibility. Causation is a complicated topic, but it is often\nfairly clear that a person is causally responsible for\u2014that is,\nshe is the (or a) salient cause of\u2014some occurrence or outcome.\nHowever, the powers and capacities that are required for moral\nresponsibility are not identical with an agent\u2019s causal powers,\nso we cannot infer moral responsibility from an assignment of causal\nresponsibility. Young children, for example, can cause outcomes while\nfailing to fulfill the requirements for general moral responsibility,\nin which case it will not be appropriate to judge them morally\nresponsible for, or to hold them morally responsible for, the outcomes\nfor which they may be causally responsible. And even generally morally\nresponsible agents may explain or defend their behavior in ways that\ncall into question their moral responsibility for outcomes for which\nthey are causally responsible. Suppose that S causes an\nexplosion by flipping a switch: the fact that S had no reason\nto expect such a consequence from flipping the switch might call into\nquestion his moral responsibility (or at least his blameworthiness)\nfor the explosion without altering his causal contribution to it.\nHaving distinguished different senses of responsibility, unless\notherwise indicated, \u201cresponsibility\u201d will refer to\n\u201cmoral responsibility\u201d (in the sense defined here)\nthroughout the rest of this entry.\n\nUntil fairly recently, the bulk of philosophical work on moral\nresponsibility was conducted in the context of debates about free\nwill, which largely concerned the various ways that (various sorts of)\ndeterminism might threaten free will and moral responsibility. A\nlargely unquestioned assumption was that free will is required for\nmoral responsibility, and the central questions had to do with the\ningredients of free will and with whether their possession was\ncompatible with determinism. Recently, however, the literature on\nmoral responsibility has addressed issues that are of interest\nindependently of worries about determinism. Much of this entry will\ndeal with these latter aspects of the moral responsibility debate.\nHowever, it will be useful to begin with issues at the intersection of\nconcerns about free will and moral responsibility.\n",
