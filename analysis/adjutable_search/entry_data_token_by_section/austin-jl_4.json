    "main_text": "Knowledge and Perception\n3. Knowledge and Perception\n\nAustin\u2019s main discussions of knowledge and perception take place\nin \u201cOther Minds\u201d (1946) and Sense and Sensibilia\n(1962a; see also \u201cUnfair to Facts\u201d [1954ms], which\noverlaps with parts of the lecture series on which Sense and\nSensibilia was based that are excised from the book, and\n\u201cIfs and Cans\u201d [1956a:\n 230]).[19]\n Stated more baldly than would have been acceptable to Austin, and\nreconstructing slightly, his distinctive views in this area include\nthe following.\n\n(1)\n\nKnowledge is a basic form of apprehension of how things are, rather\nthan a hybrid of belief conjoined with additional conditions. Knowing\nprovides a sort of guarantee about one\u2019s environment. That is,\nin at least some sense, the following is true: \u201cIf you know, you\ncan\u2019t be wrong.\u201d What a subject\u2019s knowledge\nguarantees can include truths about the environment that are\nindependent of the subject (1946: 77\u201378, 84\u2013103; 1962a:\n104\u2013131). Austin\u2019s commitment to (1) aligns him with the\ntradition of \u201cOxford Realism\u201d (see Travis and Kalderon\n2013; Marion 2000a,b, 2009; Martin ms (Other Internet Resources);\nWilliamson 2000).\n(2)\n\nKnowledge arises through the successful exercise of judgmental\ncapacities in propitious circumstances\u2014that is, through a\ncombination of acumen and opportunity (1946:\n79\u201397; 1962a: 20\u201361).\n(3)\nLike\nall other human capacities, human judgmental capacities are inherently\nlimited and fallible. The capacities are inherently limited in that\nthere are bound to exist cases with respect to which they are\ninsufficiently reliable to give rise to knowledge. And they are\ninherently fallible in that, even in the most propitious\ncircumstances, it is possible that their exercise is unsuccessful.\n(The risk of fallibility is liable to increase, of course, as the\ncapacities approach the limits within which their application is\nreliable.) (1946: 90\u201397; 1962a: 104\u2013131)\n(4)\nThe\nfact that capacities that are essentially involved in the acquisition\nof knowledge are inherently limited and fallible is consistent with\ntheir operating successfully in a variety of circumstances so as to\ngive rise to knowledge (1946: 83\u2013103; 1962a:\n104\u2013131).\n\n\nA consequence of (3) and (4) is that foundationalism is\nundercut: there are no foundational claims that are especially\ninfallible; and there are no non-foundational claims that are\ndistinctively fallible. It is possible for our judgmental capacities\nto misfire with respect to any subject matter, including e.g., our own\nfeelings or experiences. And it\u2019s possible for their exercise to\nbe sufficiently reliable to give rise to knowledge about ordinary\nmatters, e.g., that there is a pig before one.\n\n(5)\nIn\norder for exercises of capacities to make perception-based judgments\nto sustain knowledge about the subject-independent environment,\nperception must put the perceiver in contact with that environment,\nrather than being restricted in its reach to sense-data\n(1946: 86\u201397, 1962a: 10). Again, this commitment aligns Austin\nwith \u201cOxford Realism\u201d (see Hinton 1973; Travis and\nKalderon 2013; Marion 2000a,b, 2009; Martin ms (Other Internet\nResources), 1997; Snowdon 1981).\n(6)\nSome\nstandard forms of argument that perception cannot put the perceiver in\nthe required type of contact with their environment\u2014arguments\nthat have been presented in support of the claim that our basic form\nof perceptual contact is with sense-data (e.g., the so-called\n\u201cargument from illusion\u201d)\u2014are, at best, unconvincing\n(1962a: passim).\n\n\nThree further side claims that have assumed some importance in recent\nwork are the following.\n\n(7) \nAustin\nstresses that being told something by someone who\nknows it can put one in a position to know that thing (1946:\n81\u201383, 97\u2013103, 114\u2013115).\n(8)\n\nConnected with (7), Austin sketches a view on which claims to the\neffect that someone knows something can serve as assurances,\non the basis of which others are entitled to act, form beliefs, or\nclaim to know (1946: 97\u2013103).\n(9)\n\nAustin sketches a view on which utterances of the form \u201cI know\nthat such-and-such\u201d serve a performative and\nnot a descriptive function. According to this view,\nthe function of \u201cI know\u201d is very similar to the function\nof \u201cI promise\u201d: both serve as ways of giving one\u2019s\nword, the first (typically) about how things are, the second\n(typically) about how one intends them to be (1946:\n97\u2013103).\n\n",
