    "main_text": "Mill\u2019s Naturalism || Associationism\n2.2 Associationism\n\nWe might call this Mill\u2019s anti apriorism about\nknowledge\u2014the view runs deep, giving an anthropological and\nempirical character to all of his philosophy. Mill adds to it a\npsychological account of the underlying mechanism by which we form\nideas. Here, he follows very much in the tradition of the British\nEmpiricists\u2014the theory being traced by Mill back to Hobbes,\nthrough Locke and Hartley, and to James Mill\u2019s publication of\nThe Analysis of the Phenomena of the Human Mind\u2014in\nendorsing what has become known as associationist psychology:\n\u201cthe theory which resolves all the phenomena of the mind into\nideas of sensation connected together by the law of association\u201d\n(Blakey\u2019s History of Moral Science, X: 23).\n\nAll of our ideas and beliefs, Mill holds, have their origins in sense\nimpressions. Ideas or sensations which are either (i)\n\u201csimilar\u201d or (ii) \u201cfrequently experienced (or\nthought of) either simultaneously or in immediate succession\u201d,\ncome to be thought of together, and are eventually inseparably bound\ntogether in our mind, forming more complex ideas (System,\nVIII: 852; see Wilson 1990). The theory aims to derive even our most\nabstract ideas from experience\u2014\u201cPlace, Extension,\nSubstance, Cause, and the rest, are conceptions put together out of\nideas of sensation by the known laws of association\u201d\n(Examination, IX: 9)\u2014and thereby undermine the\nintuitionist\u2019s claim that such ideas are a priori.\n\nApparently a priori beliefs are subject to a similar\nundermining analysis. \n\n\nThere are innumerable cases of Belief for which no cause can be\nassigned, except that something has created so strong an association\nbetween two ideas that the person cannot separate them in thought.\n[\u2026] [T]his is one of the component and most fertile sources of\nerroneous thought. (Notes on the Analysis, XXXI: 161). \n\n\nTo give one of Mill\u2019s own examples, the apparently intuitive\nbelief that space is infinite is explained as in fact being wholly the\nresult of a process of association.\n\n\nWe have never perceived any object, or any portion of space, which had\nnot other space beyond it. And we have been perceiving objects and\nportions of space from the moment of birth. How then could the idea of\nan object, or of a portion of space, escape becoming inseparably\nassociated with the idea of additional space beyond? Every instant of\nour lives helps to rivet this association, and we never have had a\nsingle experience tending to disjoin it. (Examination, IX:\n82)\n\n\nFrom this process, we come to form the belief that space is infinite.\nBut, \n\n\nan association, however close, between two ideas, is not a sufficient\nground of belief; it is not evidence that the\ncorresponding facts are united in external nature. (Notes on the\nAnalysis, XXXI: 163) \n\n\nSuch beliefs must be tested by reasoning about what we ought\nto believe\u2014a process we shall investigate below, in\n \u00a73.2.\n",
