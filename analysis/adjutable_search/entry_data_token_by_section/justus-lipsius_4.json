    "main_text": "Later Stoic Writings\n5. Manuductionis ad Stoicam philosophiam libri tres\n\nAlthough Lipsius made a thorough study of all the ancient Stoic\nsources available to readers of his time, the Manuductio was\nnot a mere anthology of quotations. Using his well-honed skills as a\nclassical scholar, he meticulously analyzed the philological,\nhistorical and philosophical aspects of Greek and Roman Stoic\nwritings, relying primarily on Seneca and Epictetus, but also taking\ninto account Cicero, Plutarch, Diogenes Laertius and a host of other\nancient writers, including Plato, Philo Judaeus, Apuleius,\n(pseudo-)Hermes Trismegistus and Sextus Empiricus. We also find\nquotations from Scriptures and from a variety of Greek and Latin\nChurch Fathers \u2014 Clement of Alexandria, Tertullian, Minucius\nFelix, Lactantius, Eusebius and St Augustine \u2014together with\nlater Christian writers such as Orosius and Isidore of Seville.\nLipsius drew on these thinkers not only because of the historical or\nphilosophical information which they provided on Stoic philosophers\nand their doctrines but also to demonstrate the uninterrupted interest\nin Stoic philosophy of later centuries.\n\nThe Manuductio starts with a history of the most important\nphilosophical schools which existed in antiquity, followed by a\ndiscussion of the origin and succession of the various Stoic schools,\ntheir different views on the definition and parts of philosophy. He\nthen comes to the Stoic conception of the truly wise man. Taking his\ncue from Aristotle (Metaphysics 982a), Lipsius asserts that\nthe main characteristic of the wise man is that \u201che knows in a\nsense all the instances that fall under the universal\u201d\n(Manuductio II.8). The wise man (sapiens) \u2014\nwhom, following the Greek Stoic Panaetius, Lipsius regarded as in a\nstate of progress (proficiens) \u2014 will therefore study\nthe physical phenomena and their causes, learning the laws of nature\nand their relationship to the rules of conduct in order to discover\nthe nature of good and evil. If ethical precepts are to lead to\nwisdom, they must be reinforced by general doctrines and moral\ntraining. Contrary to the Stoic belief that both God and nature need\nto be comprehended by the use of reason, Lipsius \u2014 embracing\nhere a Platonic epistemology more in line with Christianity \u2014\nsaw the understanding of God and his works as a divine gift\n(Manuductio II.10). The road to wisdom, however, can only be\ndiscovered by following the rules of conduct laid down by nature. This\ntruth must be deduced by reasoning, which explains Lipsius\u2019s\nelaborate account of the Stoic theory of knowledge. Both philosophical\ndoctrines and moral precepts are necessary and complementary to one\nanother for an appreciation of the virtues and as guides to the good\nlife. Without a Stoic understanding of the world and of the supreme\ngood (summum bonum), life cannot be lived happily. According\nto Lipsius (who quotes Seneca\u2019s De vita beata), living\nhappily is the same as living according to nature (Manuductio\nII.15).\n\nLipsius devotes considerable attention to this important Stoic dictum.\nBecause there were only a few extant ancient testimonies, confusion\narose as to the precise meaning of man\u2019s supreme good. Even\nStobaeus had acknowledged that \u201cto live according to\nnature\u201d could be the same as \u201cliving according to the\nGood\u201d and \u201cliving well.\u201d Lipsius correctly\nunderstood that \u2018living in accordance with nature\u2019 was\nequivalent to \u201cliving according to virtue,\u201d so that the\ngoal was harmony with nature, with the universal law of the world and\nwith the particular rational nature of man. In his Christianized\nreading of Stoic ethics, however, Lipsius adopted the more religious\nphrasing of Seneca and Epictetus, so that \u201cliving according to\nnature or virtue\u201d became \u201cliving according to right\nreason,\u201d which the Stoics identified with Zeus or God,\n\u201cthe lord and ruler of everything\u201d (Manuductio\nII.16, referring to Diogenes Laertius VII.88). Consequently, the wise\nman was the one who obeyed God.\n\nHaving quoted the same passage in De constantia (I.14), in a\nsimilarly religious vein, Lipsius once again asserted, with his\n\u201cChristian\u201d Seneca, that \u201cwe are born into a kingdom\nwhere obedience to God is true liberty\u201d (Manuductio\nIII.12). Here, however, he explained why the ancient Greek Stoic\nCleanthes could rightly say that our common, universal nature is God\nhimself. If man is to obey his own nature, Lipsius argued, he must not\noppose the universal laws of human nature; and these laws are dictated\nby the reason or logos which the Stoics equated with God.\n\nReason, for Lipsius, is a constituent part of the nature which will\nlead man to a life of virtue (Manuductio II.17). Not\nsurprisingly, however, he replaces the Stoic logos with the\nChristian logos or \u201cWord of God\u201d from the Gospel\nof St John. Our own individual natures, as parts of nature or God,\nfunction in the same way as do souls in the human body: they are God\ndwelling in the human frame (Manuductio II.19). By\nidentifying the Stoic logos with the Christian God, Lipsius\nis able to conclude, along with Cicero and Clement of Alexandria, that\nthe Stoic supreme good is equivalent to faith in God. Virtue and\nwisdom come from the source of all knowledge: God. The Platonic\ncontemplation of the Good and the Stoic exploration of the\nrelationship of individual to universal nature are both tantamount to\nthe study of God and his logos, Christ. Therefore, the virtue\nwhich the Stoics regard as the summum bonum is the right\nattitude towards God; and this virtue is the only way to achieve the\ngood life (Manuductio II.19).\n\nStarting from the Stoic dictum that the summum bonum consists\nof virtue alone and that only virtue is good, Lipsius maintains,\nfollowing Seneca (Letter LXXI.4), that the supreme good must\nalso be honestum or morally honorable, and that it is limited\nto the soul, the rational part of man (Manuductio II.20). If\neverything is judged in relation to the standard of its own good, this\nstandard in man is reason. A man whose soul possesses reason has\ncomplete control over good and evil. In contrast to the views of the\nPlatonists and Peripatetics, Seneca considers virtue to be sufficient\non its own for the honorable life, and for the virtuous life, man\nneeds to be concerned solely with his own conduct. Like Seneca\u2019s\nsapiens, Lipsius\u2019s wise man,having control over\nhimself, chooses external things only when they are in accordance with\nnature and, as such, morally honorable. External things are good\nbecause the wise man, in his prudence and virtue, has selected them.\nChoosing rationally among things which are natural but indifferent\nwith respect to happiness is the foundation of true virtuous action.\nBecause only that which is perfect by nature can be called the good\n\u2014 just as the summum bonum is located in God, who is\nperfect \u2014 the good does not exist in man until both he and his\nreason are perfected (Manuductio II.22, referring to Seneca,\nLetter CXXIV).\n\nFor all his devotion to the Stoics, Lipsius presented a rather\neclectic account of their moral philosophy, cutting and trimming as\nreligious orthodoxy required, since by no means all Stoic teachings\nwere compatible with Christianity. It was for this reason that he\nrejected the Stoic doctrine of ethically indifferent actions\n(Manuductio II.23). It also explains why he embraced some of\nthe Stoic paradoxes, such as the notion that a kingdom should please\nthe wise man no more than slavery (Manuductio III.12), which\nreinforced Christian humility, while rejecting others, such as the\nStoic dictum that the wise man was, by his own decision, at liberty to\ntake his own life (Manuductio III.22\u201323), which was\nblatantly opposed to Christian belief.\nPhysiologiae Stoicorum libri tres\n\nCentral to Lipsius\u2019s insight into Stoic philosophy was his\nperception that its ethics and physics were inseparable: it was not\npossible to live one\u2019s life in accordance with nature, as Stoic\nethics demanded, without a full knowledge of the physical workings of\nnature. He develops this theme most fully in the companion piece to\nthe Manuductio, the Physiologia Stoicorum.\n\nIn this treatise Lipsius attempts not only to reconstruct Stoic\nnatural philosophy in detail, following the traditional didactic order\nof the doxographical tradition, but also to reassert its importance\nfor Stoic ethics and theology. Here again the main burden of\nLipsius\u2019s work is to explain away conflicts between Stoic\nphysics and Christianity or, failing that, to remove unresolved\ncontradictions from his Christianized, Neostoic natural philosophy. To\nachieve this goal, he employs three different techniques for dealing\nwith problematic Stoic doctrines: interpreting them allegorically,\nfinding similarities with Christian beliefs and imposing Neoplatonic\n\u201ccorrections\u201d on them.\n\nLipsius made his intentions clear right from the start. Endorsing the\nStoic position that the study of nature and its workings was an\nindispensable part of philosophy, he cited the well-known statements\nof Plato (Theaetetus 155D) and Aristotle\n(Metaphysics 982b) that amazement was the motive force of\nphilosophy (Physiologia I.2). In addition, he maintained that\nthe study of higher matters, such as the true nature of God and the\nuniversal laws of nature, could serve as an antidote to involvement in\npetty quarrels \u2014 the same role which, in De constantia,\nhe had assigned to constancy and the Stoic mastery of the emotions by\nreason.\n\nLipsius connected the Stoic definition of nature found in Diogenes\nLaertius (VII.156), \u201ca craftsmanlike fire proceeding to\ncreate,\u201d to the one provided by Stobaeus (Eclogues\nI.29) and Plutarch (in fact he quotes Aetius; cf. SVF II.1027):\n\u201cGod is a craftmanlike fire proceeding methodically to create\nthe world, and containing within itself all the seminal reasons; then,\nin accordance with these, everything is constructed by fate\u201d\n(Physiologia I.6).\n\nAccording to Lipsius, this showed that the Stoics believed the world\nto be the principal creation of God, in whom were contained the seeds\nof fate which controlled the birth of individual things. This fire or\nGod, containing the seminal reasons (rationes seminales),\nideas or forms of all existing things, is a Lipsian innovation,\nderiving from the Neoplatonic and Christian traditions (he quotes John\nof Damascus, De orthodoxa fide 13). Lipsius compares this\nnotion to the biblical account of Moses seeing the light glowing in\nthe bush (Exod. 3:2) and the pillar of fire which leads the Israelites\nthrough the wilderness (Exod. 14:19), and also to the burning tongues\nof the Apostles (Acts 2:3; Physiologia I.6).\n\nLipsius is indebted as well to the Corpus Hermeticum, which\nhe frequently cites when dealing with the notion of Platonic ideas and\ntheir relation to God. Arguing that God is not only the divine fire of\nthe Stoics but also the spiritus igneus (\u201cfiery\nbreath\u201d), he quotes Posidonius and Hermes Trismegistus, with the\naim of demonstrating that a similar view can be found in Christianity:\nno one sees God, and yet everyone sees God daily in all things\n(Physiologia Stoicorum I.7, citing Stobaeus,\nEclogues I.2.19 and Corpus Hermeticum XI.16). He\nrejects, however, as incompatible with Christianity, the Stoics\u2019\npantheistic equation of God with the world and their belief that the\ndivine principle is corporeal (Physiologia I.8).\n\nLipsius was nonetheless prepared to accept the view of God as the\nworld soul, which permeates every living thing (Physiologia\nI.8\u20139). He identified fate with God\u2019s providential reason\n(Physiologia I.12) and adopted St Augustine\u2019s view\n(De civitate Dei V.8) that fate does not impinge in any way\non the free will of God (Physiologia I.12). Although fate\ncauses everything, not every action is a direct result of it. Human\nbeings thus preserve their moral liberty and responsibility in the\nsphere of causae secundae (\u201csecondary causes\u201d).\nLipsius was a Christian thinker, as well as a Stoic one, and in this\ncapacity he drew on Aristotle\u2019s De generatione\nanimalium (769a-773a) to explain the existence of evil in a world\ncreated by a supremely benevolent God: deformed creatures and\nmonstrosities which seem to be contrary to nature are actually in\naccordance with the overall plan of nature and divine providence\n(Physiologia I.13).\n\nIf Lipsius did violence to the Stoic conceptions of matter, body and\nGod in order to keep faith with Christianity, he also violated certain\nChristian teachings when defending the Stoic view of the soul as a\nvital pneuma (\u201cspirit\u201d or \u201cbreath\u201d;\nPhysiologia III.9, citing Diogenes Laertius VII.157). A more\ndetailed analysis of Stoic beliefs about the soul might have brought\nto the surface embarrassing incompatibilities with Christian doctrine.\nThis would not have suited his selective approach to Stoicism, whose\npurpose was to produce a perfect marriage of pagan and Christian\nelements, which would serve to enhance the truths of Christianity.\nHowever inelegant some of Lipsius\u2019s \u201cadaptations\u201d\nmight seem, they belonged to the carefully considered program of a\nhumanist who, by promoting free will, virtue and social commitment,\nbased on a synthesis of Christian and Stoic ethics, wanted to achieve\nan acceptable, unifying and practicable Christian\nhumanitas.\n\nIt should be emphasized that Lipsius did not seek to develop a new\nphilosophy but rather wanted to produce a better \u201cunderstanding\nof Seneca.\u201d Nevertheless, it has been claimed that his\nelucidation of Stoicism gave new meaning to concepts such as freedom,\ndetermination, nature and reason, providence and God, and provided\nEuropean intellectuals with a new awareness of the world, rationality,\nfree will and individuality. It is well known that Lipsian Neostoicism\nhad a direct influence on many seventeenth-century writers \u2014\nGuillaume du Vair, Montesquieu, Bishop Bossuet and Pierry Bayle in\nFrance; Francis Bacon and Joseph Hall in England; and Francisco de\nQuevedo and Juan de Vera y Figueroa in Spain, to name but a few. One\ncould go further and say that no mention of Stoicism in the\nseventeenth and eighteenth centuries was complete without a reference\nto Lipsius\u2019s Manuductio, which became the classic work\non Stoicism for a century and a half. The most important histories of\nphilosophy \u2014 e.g., those by Georgius Hornius (1620\u20131670),\nThomas Stanley (1625\u20131678), Gerardus Johannes Vossius\n(1577\u20131649), Joannes Jonsius (1624\u20131659), Henning Witte\n(1634\u20131696), Johannes Franciscus Buddeus (1667\u20131729),\nBurckhard Gotthelf Struve (1671\u20131738),Christoph August Heumann\n(1681\u20131764) or Johann Jakob Brucker (1696\u20131770) \u2014\nall cite Lipsius\u2019s historical and philosophical introductions to\nStoic physics and morals. His two systematic treatises on Stoic\nphilosophy, \u201cpleading its cause before the court of\nChristianity\u201d (Spanneut, 239), found a prominent place in the\nlibrary of Spinoza and of other major philosophers of the early modern\nera, including Descartes and Leibniz; and it was from Lipsius that\nLocke first learned about Roman Stoicism.\n",
