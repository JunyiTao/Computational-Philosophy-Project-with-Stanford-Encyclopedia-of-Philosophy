    "main_text": "Emptiness and svabh\u0101va\n2. Emptiness and svabh\u0101va\n\nThe central concept around which all of N\u0101g\u0101rjuna\u2019s\nphilosophy is built is the notion of emptiness\n(\u015b\u016bnyat\u0101). Emptiness is of course always the\nemptiness of something, and the something N\u0101g\u0101rjuna has in\nmind here is svabh\u0101va. Different terms have been used to\ntranslate this word into English: \u201cinherent existence\u201d and\n\u201cintrinsic nature\u201d appear to be the more popular choices,\nbut \u201csubstance\u201d and \u201cessence\u201d have also been\nproposed. None of these cover the full complexity of the term,\nhowever. We therefore have to give some more detailed account of the\nway svabh\u0101va is characterized in\nN\u0101g\u0101rjuna\u2019s thought. By understanding what empty\nthings are supposed to be empty of we simultaneously gain a more\nprecise understanding of the concept of emptiness.\n\nWe can distinguish two main conceptual dimensions of the concept of\nsvabh\u0101va, an ontological one, which refers to a\nparticular way in which objects exist, and a cognitive one, which\nrefers to a way in which objects are conceptualized by human beings.\nWithin the ontological dimension we can distinguish three different\nunderstandings of svabh\u0101va: in terms of essence, in\nterms of substance, and in terms of absolute reality. (Even though\nthis distinction is largely based on Madhyamaka authors later than\nN\u0101g\u0101rjuna it is still a useful heuristic tool for\nunderstanding the philosophical point he was trying to make.)\n\nIf we understand svabh\u0101va in terms of essence it has to\nbe considered a property an object could not lose without ceasing to\nbe that very object: the svabh\u0101va of fire is to be hot,\nthe svabh\u0101va of water to be wet: whatever ceases to be\nhot is no longer fire, whatever ceases to be wet is no longer water.\nAccording to this understading svabh\u0101va is also\nidentified with the kind of specific qualities\n(svalak\u1e63a\u1e47a) that allow an observer to\ndistinguish an object from other things: by knowing that something is\nhot, together with a variety of other svalak\u1e63a\u1e47as\nwe know that what we have in front of us is fire rather than something\nelse. It is important to note that this concept of\nsvabh\u0101va (which plays only a small role in\nN\u0101g\u0101rjuna\u2019s writings but becomes more important in\nlater Madhyamaka writers) is not the target of the Madhyamaka\ncritique. When N\u0101g\u0101rjuna argues that things are empty of\nsvabh\u0101va it is not this notion of essence he is\nconcerned with. The philosophically more important understanding of\nsvabh\u0101va is an understanding in terms of substance.\n\nIn Buddhist philosophical thought preceding N\u0101g\u0101rjuna we\nfind the distinction between primary existents (dravyasat)\nand secondary existents (praj\u00f1aptisat). Primary\nexistents constitute the objective and irreducible constituents of the\nworld out there while secondary existents depend on our conceptual and\nlinguistic practices. Early schools of Buddhist metapysics hold that\nonly irreducible dharmas (entities that may be conceptualized\nanalogous to particularized properties or tropes (see Goodman 2004))\nare really real whereas everything else, including shoes and ships and\nsealing-wax is a mere aggregate of such dharmas constructed\nby our conceptualizing mind. According to this theory the entire world\naround us would be relegated to the status of mere secondary\nexistents, apart from the property particulars which are primary\nexistents. In this context svabh\u0101va is equated with\nprimary existence and denotes a specific ontological status: to exist\nwith svabh\u0101va means to be part of the basic furniture of\nthe world, independent of anything else that also happens to exist.\nSuch objects provide the ontological rock-bottom on which the diverse\nworld of phenomena rests. They provide the end-point of a chain of\nontological dependence relations.\n\nN\u0101g\u0101rjuna argues, however, that there is no such end-point\nand denies the existence of an ontological foundation (see Westerhoff\n2017. For the relation of this idea to the debate about the\nwell-foundedness of grounding in contemporary metaphysics see chapter\n3 of Westerhoff 2020). This fact is sometimes used as support of the\naccusation that Madhyamaka is really a nihilistic doctrine, a doctrine\nthat nothing exists. For if the secondary existent is reduced to the\nprimary, and if there is no primary, what is there left? This\ninterpretation has a relatively long history, beginning in ancient\nIndia and continuing to find supporters nowadays (see Spackman 2014,\nWesterhoff 2016). Nevertheless, there are powerful systematic and\nhistorical reasons against it. First of all, it is not clear that this\nkind of ontological nihilism is in fact a consistent position (if\nthere is nothing, is there not at least the fact that there is\nnothing, i.e. something? See, however, Westerhoff 2021). Secondly, the\nM\u0101dhyamikas themselves are very clear that their position avoids\nboth of the extreme views, the view that believes in the existence of\nsvabh\u0101va as well as its nihilistic opposite.\n\nIt is the understanding of svabh\u0101va as a primary\nexistent or substance that constitutes the main target of\nN\u0101g\u0101rjuna\u2019s philosophical criticism. Before we have a\ncloser look at the form this criticism takes we must briefly mention\nthe final ontological understanding of svabh\u0101va, namely\nsvabh\u0101va as absolute reality. If svabh\u0101va\nis regarded as the true nature of phenomena it is sometimes\ncharacterized as not brought about by any causal process, as\nunchangeable and as independent of any other object. The interesting\nproblem arising here is that for the Madhyamaka the true nature of\nphenomena is emptiness, i.e. the absence of svabh\u0101va\nunderstood as substance, and that svabh\u0101va understood in\nthis way is also characterized as not brought about by any\ncausal process, as unchangeable and as independent of any other\nobject. So it seems to be the case that something that has all these\nproperties must exist (since there is svabh\u0101va which is\nthe true nature of phenomena) and must not exist (since, the\nMadhyamaka argues, svabh\u0101va understood as substance does\nnot exist). In the Buddhist commentarial literature we find several\ndifferent ways of dissolving this contradiction (for more discussion\nsee Westerhoff 2009: 40\u201346). One way of tackling the issue is by\ndifferentiating two senses in which svabh\u0101va can be\n\u201cindependent of any other object\u201d. This can be understood\nas the familiar understanding of substance as a primary existent noted\nabove. But it can also be understood as meaning \u201cnot dependent\non any specific phenomenon\u201d. We could then argue that emptiness\nas the true nature of phenomena is to be understood as\nsvabh\u0101va and thus as independent only in the second, but\nnot in the first sense. This is due to the fact that\nsvabh\u0101va in the sense rejected by Madhyamaka thinkers is\nregarded as a superimposition mistakenly projected onto objects which\nin fact lack it (see below). Thus emptiness only exists as long as\nsvabh\u0101va understood as substance is mistakenly projected\nonto some object or other. Emptiness does not depend on any specific\nphenomenon to exist, but there has to be some phenomenon mistakenly\nconceived for emptiness to exist. Emptiness is not some kind of\nprimordial reality ante rem but a corrective to a mistaken\nview of how the world exists. This account boils down to saying that\nthere really are only two ways of understanding\nsvabh\u0101va: as essence and as substance. What was earlier\ncalled svabh\u0101va as absolute reality is only a specific\nform of svabh\u0101va understood as essence: in the same way\nas heat is an essential quality of fire emptiness is an essential\nquality of all phenomena. Things could not be the things they are\nwithout being empty.\n\nIn concluding our exposition of the different conceptual dimensions\nthat make up the concept of svabh\u0101va in Madhyamaka\nthought we finally have to consider the cognitive understanding of the\nterm. This constitutes an indispensable component of\nN\u0101g\u0101rjuna\u2019s concept since for him the purpose of\ndetermining the existence or non-existence of svabh\u0101va\nis not just to arrive at a theoretically satisfactory understanding of\nreality but is taken to have far more comprehensive implications for\nhow we interact with the world. Realization of the non-existence of\nsvabh\u0101va is supposed to have important soteriological\nconsequences as part of Buddhist practice; ultimately it is understood\nto be the way to the liberation from existential suffering, the final\nof the famous four noble truths expounded by the Buddha. It is\nimportant to realize that svabh\u0101va understood as\nsubstance that N\u0101g\u0101rjuna rejects is not a theoretical posit,\nan entity an insufficiently sophisticated philosopher might postulate,\nbut a kind of cognitive default, a way of superimposing something onto\nthe world that is automatic and immediate and not the result of\ndetailed theoretical reflection. We carry out such superimpositions\nwhen we regard the rapidly changing set of psycho-physical aggregates\nthat constitutes us as a single, permanent, independent self but also\nin our daily interaction with other persons, medium-sized dry goods,\nlinguistic representations and so forth. These then lead to all sorts\nof painful emotional entanglements and constitute the key source of\nsuffering described in the Buddhist teachings. It is crucial to keep\nin mind in this context that the Madhyamaka distinguishes between the\nunderstanding of the absence of svabh\u0101va or emptiness\nand its realization. The former is a purely intellectual response\nresulting from being convinced by the Madhyamaka arguments; it does\nnot entail that phenomena will no longer appear as having\nsvabh\u0101va. They will only cease to appear in this way as\na result of the realization of emptiness. The aim of Madhyamaka\nthought is therefore not simply to present an accurate account of the\nnature of the world, but to bring about a cognitive shift, a change in\nthe way in which the world appears to us. It is useful to compare this\nsituation with the perception of an optical illusion such as the\nM\u00fcller-Lyer illusion in which two lines of equal length appear to\nbe of different length. By using a ruler we can convince ourselves\nthat our perception deceives us; by learning more about perceptive\nmechanisms we can understand why we perceive the lines in the way they\ndo. But none of this implies that the lines will in the end\nlook as if they are equally long.\n",
