Parmenides, using this claim (see DK 28\nB8.15\u201316), argued that coming-to-be and passing-away are therefore\nruled out, because genuine coming-to-be is change from what-is-not to\nwhat-is, while destruction is change from what-is to what-is-not.\nThus, says Parmenides, what-is \u201cis without start or stop, since\ncoming to be and passing away have wandered very far away, and true\ntrust drove them out\u201d\n (DK 28 B8.27\u201328).[1] \n Anaxagoras accepts this principle, explaining apparent generation and\ndestruction by replacing them with mixture and separation (or\ndissociation) of ingredients:\n\n\nThe Greeks do not think correctly about coming-to-be and\npassing-away; for no thing comes to be or passes away, but is mixed\ntogether and dissociated from the things that are. And thus they\nwould be correct to call coming-to-be being mixed together and passing-away\nbeing dissociated. (DK 59 B17)\n\n\nWhat seems to us, through perception, to be generation of new entities or\ndestruction of old ones is not that at all. Rather, objects that\nappear to us to be born, to grow, and to die, are merely arrangements\nand re-arrangements of more metaphysically basic ingredients. The\nmechanism for the apparent coming-to-be is mixing and separating out\nfrom the mixture produced by the vortex motion of the ingredients. Through that mechanism, the real things, the ingredients,\ncan retain their character throughout. When an arrangement breaks\napart (or \u201cpasses away\u201d) the ingredients are dissociated\nfrom one another (through separation) and can be re-mixed to form (or\n\u201cbecome\u201d) different arrangements, i.e., other perceptible\nobjects.\n\n\nOne way to think of Anaxagoras\u2019 point in B17 is that animals,\nplants, human beings, the heavenly bodies, and so on, are natural\nconstructs. They are constructs because they depend\nfor their existence and character on the ingredients of which they are\nconstructed (and the pattern or structure that they acquire in the\nprocess). Yet they are natural because their\nconstruction occurs as one of the processes of nature. Unlike\nhuman-made artifacts (which are similarly constructs of\ningredients), they are not teleologically determined to fulfill some\npurpose. This gives Anaxagoras a two-level metaphysics. Things\nsuch as earth, water, fire, hot, bitter, dark, bone, flesh, stone, or\nwood are metaphysically basic and genuinely real (in the required\nEleatic sense): they are things-that-are. The objects constituted\nby these ingredients are not genuinely real, they are temporary\nmixtures with no autonomous metaphysical status: they are not\nthings-that-are. (The natures of the ingredients, and the\nquestion of what is included as an ingredient, are addressed below; see\n3.2 \u201cIngredients and Seeds\u201d). This view, that the\ningredients are more real than the objects that they make up, is common\nin Presocratic philosophy, especially in the theories of those thinkers\nwho were influenced by Parmenides\u2019 arguments against the\npossibility of what-is-not and so against genuine coming-to-be and\npassing-away. It can be found in Empedocles, and in the\npre-Platonic atomists, as well as, perhaps, in Plato\u2019s middle\nperiod Theory of Forms (Denyer, 1983, Frede 1985, W.-R. Mann 2000, Silverman\n2002).\n",
