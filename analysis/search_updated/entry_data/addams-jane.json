    "preamble": "\n\nJane Addams (1860\u20131935) was an activist, community organizer,\ninternational peace advocate, and social philosopher in the United\nStates during the late 19th century and early 20th century. However,\nthe dynamics of canon formation resulted in her philosophical\nwork being largely ignored until the\n 1990s.[1]\n Addams is best known for her pioneering activism in the social\nsettlement movement\u2014the radical arm of the progressive movement\nwhose adherents so embraced the ideals of progressivism that they\nchose to live as neighbors in oppressed communities to learn from and\nhelp the marginalized members of society. Although her contemporaries\nwidely lauded her activism and accomplishments, commentators typically\nmapped Addams\u2019 work onto conventional gender understandings:\nmale philosophers such as John Dewey, William James, and George\nHerbert Mead were regarded as providing original progressive thought,\nwhile Addams was seen as brilliantly administering their theories.\nRecent work by feminist philosophers and historians has revealed that\nAddams was far more than a competent practitioner. Her dozen published\nbooks, and over 500 articles display a robust intellectual interplay\nbetween experience and reflection in the American pragmatist\ntradition. The near half-century that she lived and worked as the\nleader of the Chicago social settlement, Hull House, allowed her to\nbring her commitment to social improvement, feminism, diversity, and\npeace into reflective practice. These experiences provided the\nfoundation for an engaging philosophical perspective. Addams viewed\nher settlement work as a grand epistemological endeavor, but in the\nprocess, she never forgot her neighbors\u2019 humanity. Addams was a public\nphilosopher who was not afraid to get her hands dirty.\n\nAddams\u2019 philosophy combined feminist sensibilities with an\nunwavering commitment to social improvement through cooperative\nefforts. Although she sympathized with feminists, socialists, and\npacifists, Addams refused to be labeled. This refusal was pragmatic\nrather than ideological. Addams\u2019 commitment to social cohesion\nand cooperation prompted her to eschew what she perceived as divisive\ndistinctions. Active democratic social progress was so essential to\nAddams that she did not want to alienate any group of people from the\nconversation or the participation necessary for effective inclusive\ndeliberation. Addams carefully varied her rhetorical approach to\nengaging a variety of constituencies, which makes identifying her\nsocial philosophy challenging. Accordingly, Addams did not intend to\nengage in philosophical narratives removed from social improvement,\nnor did she intend to pursue social activism without theorizing about\nthe broader implications of her work. In this respect, through her\nintegration of theory and action, Addams carried pragmatism to its\nlogical conclusion through her integration of theory and action,\ndeveloping an applied philosophy immersed in social action. Thus\nAddams\u2019 writing is replete with examples from her Hull House\nexperience addressing atypical topics for philosophic discourse, such\nas garbage collection, immigrant folk stories, and prostitution. It is\neasy for those steeped in traditional philosophy to dismiss\nAddams\u2019 writings as non-philosophical if the full sweep of her\nprojects and subsequent analysis is not considered. For those who\npersevere, Addams offers a rich social and political philosophy built\non respect and understanding that is refreshing in its faith in the\npotential for collective progress.\n\nIdentifying Jane Addams as a philosopher requires appreciating the\ndynamic between theory and action reflected in her writing.\nFurthermore, Addams was a voracious reader and purveyor of the\nintellectual ideas of her time, such as evolutionary theory.\nTherefore, her writing is nuanced, with references that require a\ncontextual understanding of pertinent ideas of the time. Reading\nAddams, one finds a wellspring of nascent feminist philosophical\ninsight. Addams\u2019 ethical philosophy was guided by the notion of\nsympathetic knowledge that she described as \u201cthe only way of\napproach to any human problem\u201d (NCA 7). Sympathetic knowledge is\na mingling of epistemology and ethics: knowing one another better\nreinforces the common connection of people such that the potential for\ncaring and empathetic moral actions increases. Addams not only\ntheorized about this idea, but she lived it. Sympathetic knowledge\nunderwrote Addams\u2019 approach to the diversity and staggering\npoverty (HHM) that she confronted in the immigrant neighborhood\nsurrounding Hull House and allowed her to develop a precursor to\ncontemporary feminist standpoint epistemology. Addams\u2019\nleadership among the American pragmatists in understanding the poor\nand oppressed resulted in a more radical form of pragmatism than Dewey\nand James, a social philosophy imbued with a class and gender\nconsciousness.\n",

    "main_text": "\n1. Life\n\nCompared to the many biographical accounts of Addams\u2019 life, relatively\nfew comprehensively consider her philosophy. However, her\nphilosophical insights are closely tied to her life experiences which\nare briefly recounted below.\n\nLaura Jane Addams was born in Cedarville, Illinois, on September 6,\n1860. She grew up in the shadow of the Civil War and during a time\nwhen Darwin\u2019s Origin of the Species achieved widespread\ninfluence. Her childhood reflected the material advantage of being the\ndaughter of a politician and successful mill owner, John Addams. When\nJane was two years old, her mother, Mary, died giving birth to her\nninth child. Subsequently, the precocious Addams doted upon her father\nand benefited emotionally and intellectually from his attention.\nAlthough John Addams was no advocate of feminism, he desired higher\neducation for his daughter. Therefore, he sent her to the\nall-women\u2019s institution, Rockford Seminary (renamed later\nRockford College) in Rockford, Illinois. As a result, Addams became\npart of a generation of women that were among the first in their\nfamilies to attend college. At Rockford, she experienced the\nempowerment of living in a women-centered environment, and she\nblossomed as an intellectual and a social leader. Her classmates and\nteachers acknowledged this leadership. Ultimately, Addams spearheaded\nan effort to bring baccalaureate degrees to the school and, after\nserving as class valedictorian, received the first one.\n\nLike many women of her time, Addams\u2019 prospects after college\nwere limited. She made a failed attempt at medical school and then,\nprecipitated by her father\u2019s death, slipped into a nearly decade-long\nmalaise over the direction of her life. At first, the energy and\nspirit of her undergraduate college experience did not translate into\nany clear career path, given that she had rejected both marriage and\nreligious life. Moreover, Addams\u2019 malady was somewhat analogous\nto the unidentified illness that her later acquaintance, Charlotte\nPerkins Gilman (as described in The Yellow Wallpaper),\nsuffered. As a member of the privileged class, her soul searching\nincluded a trek to Europe, which Addams made twice during this period.\nOn the second trip, she visited Toynbee Hall, a pioneering Christian\nsettlement house in London, which was to inspire her in a direction\nthat propelled her toward international prominence (TYH 53).\n\nToynbee Hall was a community of young men committed to helping the\npoor of London by living among them. After engaging the leaders of\nToynbee Hall, Addams was rejuvenated by the idea of replicating the\nsettlement in the United States. She enlisted a college friend, Ellen\nGates Starr, in the plan. However, identifying their vague idea as a\n\u201cplan\u201d is a bit of hyperbole. There were very few specific\nblueprints for what the settlement would be other than a good neighbor\nto oppressed peoples. Nevertheless, Addams found a suitable\nlocation in a devastatingly poor Chicago immigrant neighborhood, and\non September 18, 1889, Hull House opened its doors. Working amidst one\nof the most significant influxes of immigrants the United States has\never known, Hull House got off to a slow start as neighbors did not\nknow what to make of the residents and their intentions. However,\nAddams and Starr built trust, and in a short time, Hull\nHouse became an incubator for new social programs and a magnet\nfor progressives wanting to make society a better place. Without\nformal ideological or political constraints, the settlement workers\nresponded to the neighborhood\u2019s needs by starting project after\nproject. The list of projects created at Hull House is astounding,\nincluding the first little theatre and juvenile court in the United\nStates and the first playground, gymnasium, public swimming pool, and\npublic kitchen in Chicago. In addition, the work of Hull House\nresidents would result in numerous labor union organizations, a labor\nmuseum, tenement codes, factory laws, child labor laws, adult\neducation courses, cultural exchange groups, and the collection of\nneighborhood demographic data. Hull House was a dynamo of progressive\ninitiatives, all of which Addams oversaw.\n\nThe reputation of the settlement rapidly grew, and women, primarily\ncollege-educated, came from all over the country to live and work\nat Hull House. Although Hull House was co-educational, it was a\nwoman-identified space. There were male residents at Hull House, some\nof whom later became prominent leaders. However, the policies,\nprojects, decision-making, and methodologies of the Hull House\ncommunity were gynocentric\u2014foregrounding women\u2019s\nexperience, analysis, and concerns. Furthermore, although a few\nresidents were married, most were single, and some were in committed\nrelationships with other women. Given the drastic shifts in sexual\nmores in the twentieth century, the contemporary understanding of what\nit means to be lesbian cannot straightforwardly be mapped onto the\nlate and post-Victorian eras. Still, it can be argued that Hull\nHouse was a lesbian-friendly space. Addams set the tone for this\nidentification with her own long-term intimate relationships with\nwomen, first with Starr and then with Mary Rozet Smith (Brown,\n2004).\n\nFrom the outset of its operation, Addams theorized about the nature\nand function of Hull House. The language she used reflected her\nphilosophical approach. For example, in one published essay, Addams\ndescribes the application and reorganization of knowledge as the\nfundamental problem of modern life and then claims that settlements\nare like applied universities: \u201cThe ideal and developed\nsettlement would attempt to test the value of human knowledge by\naction, and realization, quite as the complete and ideal university\nwould concern itself with the discovery of knowledge in all\nbranches\u201d (FSS 187). This kind of reflective analysis and wider\nthematization of her work and the social settlement work was a\nhallmark of Addams\u2019 writing. Because of her insightful\nreflections on the Hull House community, Addams became a popular\nauthor and sought-after public speaker. Eventually, she extended her\ncosmopolitan analysis to race, education, and world peace issues.\nFor Addams, local experiences were always a springboard for political\ntheorizing.\n\nAddams became one of the most respected and recognized individuals in\nthe nation. She played a crucial role in numerous progressive\ncampaigns. Addams was a founding figure in the National Association\nfor the Advancement of Colored People, the American Civil Liberties\nUnion, and the Women\u2019s International League for Peace and\nFreedom. Her popularity was such that when Theodore Roosevelt sought\nthe presidential nomination of the Progressive Party in 1912, he asked\nJane Addams to second the nomination, the first time a woman had\nparticipated in such an act. There was a gendered dimension to this\npopularity, however. Addams had challenged the borders of the public\nand private spheres through her work at Hull House. Still, her\nforays into masculine domains were masked by the \u201csocial\nhousekeeping\u201d characterization of the settlement activism. After\nWorld War I broke out in Europe, her outspoken pacifism and refusal to\nendorse the war or the U.S. entry into it was more gender role\ntransgression than the public could tolerate from a woman.\nAddams\u2019 popularity fell, and she became the victim of vicious\ngender-specific criticism. Biographer Allen Davis reports that one\nwriter indicated that what Addams needed to disabuse her of her\npacifism was \u201ca strong, forceful husband who would lift the\nburden of fate from her shoulders and get her intensely interested in\nfancy work and other things dear to the heart of women who have homes\nand plenty of time on their hands\u201d (240). A reporter for the\nLos Angeles Times quipped,\n\nIf Miss Addams and her peace mission are a sample of women in world\naffairs, I want to take it all back. I am sincerely sorry I voted for\nsuffrage. (Davis, 253)\n\n\nHer new role as social outcast and critic allowed the public\nphilosopher in Addams to reflect on the nature of citizenship and\npatriotism in her many books and articles\u2014some of which had\ndifficulty getting into print because she was perceived as\nanti-American. Although she had written on peace early in her public\ncareer (NIP), from 1914 through the end of her life, Addams\u2019\npublications became decidedly more focused on issues of peace and war,\nincluding two books exclusively dedicated to the topic (WH, PBT) and\nseveral books with sections devoted to the nature and politics of war\n(LRW, STY, MFJ). Although initially criticized, Addams\u2019 pacifist\ntenacity was ultimately lauded with the Nobel Peace Price (1931). In\nthe last years of her life, she spent less time at Hull House and more\ntime working for world peace and an end to racism. Addams died of\ncancer on May 21, 1935, leaving a tremendous intellectual legacy that\nhas yet to be fully explored.\n2. Influences\n\nAddams was well-read and could claim numerous and varied influences.\nHowever, Addams was no one\u2019s prot\u00e9g\u00e9. Addams chose\nintellectual resources that resonated with her notion of sympathetic\nknowledge in bringing about social progress. A few significant\ninfluences are recounted here. Addams read Thomas Carlyle\u2019s\n(1795\u20131881) work while she was attending Rockford Seminary.\nCarlyle\u2019s social morality held a particular appeal to Addams. He\nbelieved the universe was ultimately good and moral and led by a\ndivine will that worked through society\u2019s heroes and leaders.\nCarlyle wrote biographies of social saviors that came in the form of\npoets, kings, prophets, and intellectuals, mixing in commentary that\nexplicated his moral philosophy. However, Carlyle\u2019s heroes\nreflect the evolution of society, as different contexts require\ndifferent leadership. These heroes can recognize the social dynamics\nat work and use them for the benefit of others. Carlyle\u2019s heroes\nevolved. For Carlyle, everyone has a public duty and needs to find\nthemselves or realize their place in the world and what their work on\nbehalf of society should be. Because of his emphasis on powerful\nindividuals, Carlyle was not particularly fond of democracy. Although\nAddams shed Carlyle\u2019s notion of individualistic heroism and his\ndisdain for democracy, she retained the valorization of moral action\nthroughout her career. Furthermore, Carlyle\u2019s morality was\ngrounded in social relations: to be moral is to be in right relation\nwith God and others. Carlyle\u2019s relational ethic is a precursor to\nAddams\u2019 notion of sympathetic knowledge.\n\nAddams was also influenced by John Ruskin (1819\u20131900), who\ntheorized that art and culture reflected the moral health of society.\nAlthough Ruskin maintained a certain elitism in his view that great\npeople produced great art, he also saw such great cultural works as a\nmanifestation of the well-being of society as a whole. The plight of\nthe oppressed was tied to a sense of the aesthetic. Indeed,\nAddams\u2019 valorization of art and culture, as exhibited in the\nappearance and activities of Hull House resonates with Ruskin\u2019s\naesthetics. For Addams, \u201cSocial Life and art have always seemed\nto go best at Hull House\u201d (STY 354). Addams viewed art and\ncultural activities as reinforcing essential human bonds (DSE 29).\nRuskin also influenced Arnold Toynbee and other future settlement\nworkers by identifying the problems in large industrial cities and\ncalling for reforms foreshadowing the safety nets typical of later\nwelfare states. Ruskin valued labor as a noble means of\nself-actualization. This became a crucial concept for Addams as she\nsought meaningful labor for those in the Hull House neighborhood. For\nexample, Addams expresses sympathy for laborers who skipped work or\ncame in late for work because \u201call human interest has been\nextracted from it\u201d (SYC 129). Although Addams valued\nRuskin\u2019s moral imagination, the concept of labor, and ideas\nabout transforming the city through infusing culture, she rejected his\nromanticization of the preindustrial past. With a strong belief in\nsocial progress, Addams did not desire a return to a previous era. For\nAddams, society should grow and adapt to its conditions, even\nregarding moral philosophy.\n\nLeo Tolstoy (1828\u20131910) was another type of hero to Addams.\nUnlike Carlyle, Tolstoy did not valorize individuals standing out from\nthe crowd as exemplary moral paragons who wield socially ordained\npositions of power. Instead, he valued solidarity with the common\nlaborer. Addams\u2019 vast intellectual curiosity made such extremes\nin influences possible. Addams read Tolstoy\u2019s works from the\ntime she graduated from college until the last years of her life, and\nshe often praised his writing in articles and book reviews.\nTolstoy\u2019s emphasis on working for and with the oppressed while\nwriting novels and essays that influenced a wider audience resonated\nwith Addams\u2019 work and writings. However, Tolstoy was a moral\nidealist. He left everything behind to take up the plow and work as a\ntypical farm laborer. Addams was moved by Tolstoy\u2019s account,\nand\u2014typical of her self-critical, thoughtful approach--she\nquestioned her leadership role in the social settlement, but only for\na short time.\n\nMotivated by Tolstoy\u2019s troubling moral challenge to work in\nsolidarity with the common laborer, Addams sought him out while she\nwas on vacation (and recovering from typhoid) in Europe in 1896. The\nmeeting made a lasting impression on Addams (TYH 191\u2013195).\nTolstoy came in from working the fields to be introduced to Addams and\nher partner Mary Rozet Smith. The meeting began with Tolstoy\nquestioning Addams\u2019 fashion choice because the sleeves of her\narms, consistent with the style of the time, had \u201cenough stuff\non one arm to make a frock for the girl\u201d (TYH 192). Tolstoy was\nconcerned that the trappings of material wealth alienated Addams from\nthose she was working with. This criticism continued when Tolstoy\nlearned that part of Hull House\u2019s funding came from\nAddams\u2019 estate, which included a working farm: \u201cSo you are\nan absentee landlord? Do you think you will help the people more by\nadding yourself to the crowded city than you would by tilling your own\nsoil?\u201d (TYH 192) The remarks humbled Addams, and, on her return\nto Hull House, she was determined to take up more direct labor by\nworking in the new Hull House bakery. However, reality demonstrated\nhow Tolstoy\u2019s idealism was incompatible with her work in social\nsettlements: \u201cThe half dozen people invariably waiting to see me\nafter breakfast, the piles of letters to be opened and answered, the\ndemand of actual and pressing human wants\u2014were these all to be\npushed aside and asked to wait while I saved my soul by two\nhours\u2019 work at baking bread?\u201d (TYH 197)\n\nTheoretically, the shared experience of common labor would break down\nclass distinctions. Addams had experienced such camaraderie at Hull\nHouse, and she never stopped appreciating Tolstoy\u2019s social\ncriticism. However, she saw the value of intelligent leadership.\nSomeone had to organize the clubs, arrange for philanthropic support,\nand chair the meetings. Addams found Tolstoy\u2019s labor demand to\nbe self-indulgent to a certain extent. If she engaged in the labor of\nthe poor exclusively, she might alleviate her upper-class guilt.\nStill, she would no longer be working holistically toward changing the\nstructure of society. Addams\u2019 philosophy of civic activism\nvalued engagement through ongoing presence and listening. Indeed, Hull\nHouse had a very flat and responsive organizational structure.\nNevertheless, Tolstoy\u2019s absolutist moral demands failed to\nconsider context\u2014a hallmark of Addams\u2019 approach.\n\nAddams found Tolstoy\u2019s pacifism inspiring. She admired how\nTolstoy sympathized with revolutionaries in the 1870s but did not\ncompromise his moral convictions because of these sympathies. Tolstoy\noffered a doctrine of non-resistance that sought to substitute moral\nenergy for physical force. Addams once again did not accept\nTolstoy\u2019s pacifist ideas uncritically. For example, she\nquestioned the clarity of the categories (moral energy versus physical\nforce) that Tolstoy created in his doctrine of non-resistance (TYH\n195). Addams also asked whether Tolstoy reduced social issues too\nsimplistically, albeit eloquently. Despite her less than pleasant\nmeeting with him, Addams cited Tolstoy as a positive moral example\nthroughout her life. However, like all her influences, she could not\naccept Tolstoy\u2019s philosophy uncritically. Addams had to adapt\nand infuse her insight to make it work for the society she was a part\nof.\n\nAs previously mentioned, Toynbee Hall was an inspiration for Hull\nHouse, and Canon Barnett (1844\u20131913), who served as\n\u201cwarden\u201d of the settlement for over twenty years, was the\ninspirational force. Before his service at Toynbee Hall, Barnett\nworked as Vicar of St. Judes, Whitechapel. He instituted many\nimprovements to the slums surrounding the Church, including building\neducational and recreational programs. It was St. Judes that students\nfrom Oxford would visit, working to help improve conditions for\nresidents of the surrounding community, all the while engaging in\ndiscussions about how to institute social reforms. One of those\nstudents was Andrew Toynbee.\n\nBarnett describes a threefold rationale for the development and growth\nof settlements: First, a general distrust that government-sponsored\ninstitutions could care for the poor. In particular, government and\nprivate philanthropy appeared to be failing the masses. Second,\nBarnett viewed the need for information as spurring the rise of\nsettlements. Barnett believed there was widespread curiosity regarding\noppression that he could satisfy with documented observations\nregarding the circumstances of the poor. Finally, Barnett notes a\ngroundswell of fellowship not driven by traditional \u201cCharities\nand Missions\u201d but by fundamental humanitarianism. Settlements\nprovided an outlet for these fellow feelings.\n\nAddams was familiar with Barnett\u2019s writings and often referred\nto them. For example, when Addams wrote \u201cThe Function of the\nSocial Settlement,\u201d Barnett\u2019s philosophy played a\nprominent role. She agrees that settlements should not be\nmissions because if they become too ideological, they will fail to be\nresponsive to their neighbors (FSS 344\u2013345). However, despite\nacknowledging that the term \u201csettlement\u201d was borrowed from\nLondon, she finds differences between the philosophies of Toynbee Hall\nand Hull House: \u201cThe American Settlement, perhaps has not so\nmuch a sense of duty of the privileged toward the unprivileged of the\n\u2018haves\u2019 to the \u2018have nots,\u2019 to borrow Canon\nBarnett\u2019s phrase, as a desire to equalize through social effort\nthose results which superior opportunity may have given the\npossessor\u201d (FSS 322\u2013323). Addams is very concerned about a\nsense of moral superiority attributed to settlement work. She always\neschewed the notion that she was a charitable \u201clady\nbountiful.\u201d Instead, she wanted to learn about others to develop\nthe proper sympathies and strategies for assisting\u2014sympathetic\nknowledge. For Addams, Hull House always combined epistemological\nconcerns with moral ones.\n\nWhen Addams\u2019 philosophy is considered, if at all, it is usually\nassociated with the work of John Dewey (1859\u20131952). This\nassociation is appropriate given their friendship and mutual\ninterests; however, her intellectual deference to Dewey is often\noverstated. Dewey is considered one of the greatest American\nphilosophers. His name, along with William James, Charles Sanders\nPeirce, and Josiah Royce, is included in the traditional list of\nfounding fathers of what is labeled American Pragmatism. His work\nappealed to Addams because they shared many of the same commitments,\nincluding the value of a robust democracy as well as the importance of\neducation that engaged the student\u2019s experience. Addams and\nDewey were intellectual soul mates from the moment they met in 1892.\nDewey visited Hull House shortly after it opened and before he moved\nto Chicago to teach at the University of Chicago. Following the\nmeeting, Dewey expressed to Addams an appreciation for Hull\nHouse\u2019s work, and he would become a frequent visitor. There was\nmuch intellectual cross-fertilization between Hull House and the\nUniversity of Chicago and vice versa. Historian Rosalind\nRosenberg describes Addams as a de facto adjunct professor at\nthe University of Chicago. Mary Jo Deegan documents that Addams\ntaught many college courses through the Extension Division of the\nUniversity of Chicago for a decade. In addition, she refused offers to\njoin the undergraduate and graduate faculty (Deegan, 1988).\nFurthermore, Dewey assigned Addams\u2019 books in his courses. Addams\nand Dewey worked together personally and politically. When Hull House\nwas incorporated, Dewey became one of the board members. He often\nlectured to the Plato Club, Hull House\u2019s philosophy group. Dewey\ndedicated his book Liberalism and Social Action to Addams.\nDewey named one of his daughters in her honor, and Addams wrote the\neulogy for Dewey\u2019s son Gordon (EBP).\n\nAlthough Dewey and Addams gained celebrity status in their lifetime,\ntheir fame and legacies are characterized much differently. Dewey is\nframed as the great intellectual\u2014a thinker\u2014and Addams was\nthe activist\u2014a doer. As contemporaries, they represent classic\narchetypes of gender: the male as mind generating theory and the woman\nas body experiencing and caring. However, there is much evidence that\nsuch characterizations are inaccurate. Both John Dewey and his\ndaughter, Jane, credit Jane Addams for developing many of his\nimportant ideas, including his view on education, democracy, and,\nultimately, philosophy (Schlipp, 1951). Despite the lack of\nattribution in Dewey\u2019s written work, many scholars document\nAddams\u2019 significant influence (Davis, 1973; Deegan, 1988;\nFarrell, 1967; Lasch, 1965; Linn, 2000; Seigfried, 1996)\n\nOvershadowed by Addams\u2019 relationship with the celebrity\nphilosopher, Dewey, was her strong tie to George Herbert Mead\n(1863\u20131931), who is considered the father of \u201csymbolic\ninteractionism,\u201d an approach to social inquiry that emphasizes\nhow symbols create meaning in society. Mead\u2019s work on\ndevelopment through play and education influenced Addams, but, as with\nDewey, the influence was mutual. Addams maintained a long-term close\npersonal relationship with Mead and his wife, Helen Castle Mead. They\noften dined together and visited one another\u2019s families. Like\nAddams\u2019, Mead\u2019s intellectual legacy is not altogether\nsettled. Sociologists have recognized his works as significant, but\nmany philosophers have overlooked him.\n\nMead and Addams worked on several projects together, including\npro-labor speeches, peace advocacy, and the Progressive Party. When\nAddams was publicly attacked for not supporting the U.S. entry into\nWorld War I, Mead defended her though he disagreed with her position.\nLike Dewey, Mead was a frequent lecturer at Hull House. Also, like\nDewey, Mead could not help but be impressed with Addams\u2019\nintellect. In 1916, Mead advocated awarding Addams an honorary\ndoctorate from the University of Chicago. The faculty supported the\naward, but the administration overturned the decision (eventually\nmaking the award in 1931).\n\nAddams also maintained a friendship with William James\n(1842\u20131910), whose work she cites on many occasions. James was a\npragmatist whose vision of urban improvement would have been shared by\nAddams. James and Addams both valued experience, and among the\n\u201cprofessional\u201d pragmatists his writing style is\nclosest to Addams\u2019 in terms of its readability and use of\ntangible examples.\n\nAddams influenced and was influenced by the \u201cChicago\nSchool,\u201d an active collaboration of cross-disciplinary scholars\nat the University of Chicago, including Dewey, Mead, James Hayden\nTufts, Robert E. Park, and others who had a significant impact on\nphilosophy, psychology, and sociology. Although she was often\nfrustrated with the abstract trajectory of the university, Addams\nembraced reflective analysis. Through her Hull House experience,\nAddams took many opportunities to theorize about the interchange\nbetween theory and practice. For a time, American philosophy,\nsociology, and social work existed in a symbiotic harmony\u2014each\nnot differentiated from the other but benefiting from the interchange.\nUnfortunately, since the early 20th century when Mead,\nDewey, and Addams were together in Chicago, the intellectual genealogy\nof American philosophy, sociology, and social work has more\ndrastically diverged to a point where the crossover is less likely and\nperhaps less welcome. Lost in the compartmentalization of these\ndisciplines is how Jane Addams played a role in each.\n\nIn addition to the Romantics (Carlyle and Ruskin), the social\nvisionaries (Barnett and Tolstoy), and the pragmatists (Dewey and\nMead), Addams was influenced by the great collection of feminist minds\nwho came to work at the social settlement. Hull House has been\ndescribed in many different ways, reflecting the complexity and\ndiversity of its functions. Perhaps an overlooked descriptor is as a\npragmatist feminist \u201cthink tank.\u201d Although the\n\u201cMetaphysical Club\u201d has taken on a mythical status among\nsome in American philosophical circles (Menand, 2001), the\nintellectual, social, and political impact of the Hull House residents\ndwarfs that of the Cambridge intellectuals. Hull House residents\ndined, slept, did domestic chores, and engaged in social activism\ntogether. They also discussed and debated ethics, political theory,\nfeminism, and culture while immersed in their tasks and stimulated by\nthe many speakers and visitors to Hull House. The prolonged contact\nshared gender oppression and common mission made for a unique\nintellectual collective that not only fostered action but also\ntheory.\n\nOstensibly, Hull House was the first co-educational settlement. Addams\nrecognized the need for male residents so that men in the neighborhood\ncould better relate to Hull House endeavors. However, it was clear to\nvisitors and residents that Hull House was a woman\u2019s space. Hull\nHouse boasted some of the era\u2019s great minds and change agents. Alice\nHamilton (1869\u20131970), a physician who trained in Germany and the\nU.S. and is credited with founding the field of industrial medicine,\nlived at Hull House for 22 years. She went on to teach at Harvard,\nbecoming a nationally recognized social reformer and peace activist.\nJulia Lathrop (1858\u20131932) was a Vassar graduate who, in 1912,\nafter residing at Hull House for 22 years, became the first woman to\nhead a federal agency, the Children\u2019s Bureau, which, in terms of\nconduct, she modeled after Hull House. Rachel Yarros\n(1869\u20131946), a twenty-year resident at Hull House, was also a\nphysician who taught at the University of Illinois. The university\ncreated a position for Yarros to recognize her tremendous contribution\nto social hygiene and sex education. Author and feminist theorist\nCharlotte Perkins Gilman (1860\u20131935) was a resident for a short\ntime. Gilman thought highly of Addams but had no stomach for\nsettlement existence amongst the oppressed. However, Gilman\u2019s\ngroundbreaking work on gender and economics likely influenced Addams.\nSophonisba Breckinridge (1866\u20131948) graduated from Wellesley and\nobtained a Ph.D. in political science and a J.D. from the University\nof Chicago. Her most significant contribution was in the area of\nsocial work education. Edith Abbott (1876\u20131957) and her sister\nGrace Abbott (1878\u20131939) joined Hull-House about the time as\nBreckinridge (1907). Edith Abbott would obtain a Ph.D. in Political\nEconomy from the University of Chicago, while Grace Abbott earned a\nPh.D. from Grand Island College in Nebraska. Edith would have an\nacademic career at the University of Chicago prior to her appointment\nas Chief of the Children\u2019s Bureau after Julia Lathrop\u2019s\ndeparture. Mary Kenney (1864\u20131943) became a vital labor\norganizer for Samuel Gompers\u2019 American Federation of Labor and\ninfluenced Addams\u2019 sensitivity to the plight of organized labor,\nsomething that all progressives did not share. Bessie Abramowitz\nHillman, a Russian immigrant who attended classes at Hull House,\nfounded the Amalgamated Clothing Workers of America (ACWA) in 1910 at\nthe age of 20 and guided it for 60 years. Hillman referred to the\nsettlement as \u201ca House of Labor\u201d, and she worked with and\nadmired Addams until the latter\u2019s passing. Another resident who became\na significant labor leader was Alzina Stevens. She headed the Dorcas\nFederal Labor Union and became a member of the Council of Women\u2019s\nTrade Unions of Chicago. Addams worked with and cultivated numerous\nlabor leaders during this nascent time of the American labor movement.\nThese are only a few of the more well-known residents, but numerous\nfeminists used their Hull House experience as a springboard to careers\nin social reform or professions of various sorts. Addams engaged the\nresidents of Hull House in conversation and deliberation such that\nthey influenced her thoughts and she theirs.\n\nAlthough Hull House was replete with extraordinary minds, no one was\nlikely to be as intellectually challenging to Addams as Florence\nKelley (1859\u20131932). A Cornell graduate, Kelley translated\nFriedrich Engels\u2019 The Condition of the Working Class in\nEngland and Karl Marx\u2019s Free Trade into English.\nShe was an active member of the Socialist Labor Party until the\nleadership, threatened by Kelley\u2019s aggressive style, expelled\nher. A single mother with three children, Kelley found a home at Hull\nHouse, where she opened an employment center and began researching\nsweatshops for the Illinois Bureau of Labor Statistics. Kelley would\nlater become the general secretary of the new Consumer\u2019s League,\nan organization dedicated to using consumer pressure to ensure that\nsafe and high-quality goods were manufactured. Kelley was one of the\nmost distinguished social reformers of the early 20th\nCentury.\n\nAt Hull House, Kelley altered the dynamics of the resident community.\nShe brought a sense of class consciousness along with great strength\nof conviction. After Kelley\u2019s arrival (and Mary Kenny\u2019s\ncoming a year prior) Hull House became more deeply involved in\nsupporting the labor movement, which men heretofore dominated. Kelley\nalso learned from Addams, who she admired throughout her life. Perhaps\nthe legacy of the many accomplishments of the Hull-House residents\nsuffered because of the fame of their leader. Still, given the\nopportunity, each expressed their admiration and gratitude to Addams\nfor making Hull House the hotbed of ideas and action. Addams was the\nmost visible leader of a remarkable group of educated activists whose\nmutual respect allowed intellectual growth to flourish.\n\nFinally, a few other influences are worthy of mention. Although she\nwas not personally religious, Addams\u2019 Christian roots left their\nmark. Addams was exceptionally well versed in the Christian bible and\nhad attended several religious courses during her time at Rockford\nSeminary. Addams occasionally used religious language to help get her\nmessage out to Christian constituencies. Addams was also well\nacquainted with Greek philosophy and referenced Socrates, Plato, and\nAristotle in her work. Addams was attracted to the ability of Greek\nphilosophers to move between personal and social concerns rather than\ncompartmentalizing their philosophical analysis. Some have suggested\nthat Addams was influenced by Auguste Comte (1798\u20131857) and the\npositivists (Misheva 2019). Comte, who coined the term\n\u201csociology,\u201d believed sciences need their own logic drawn\nfrom experience rather than Descartes\u2019s a priori universal\nrationalism. Addams would have been attracted to his ideas about\nsocial progress and his development of a religion of humanity. Addams\nalso read a great deal of literature, which influenced her ideas\nconcerning culture and sometimes seeped into her analysis, as it does\nwhen she uses Shakespeare\u2019s King Lear to understand\nlabor-management relations. Although she did not believe that reading\nwas a substitute for direct experience, she did suggest more than once\nthat reading great works of fiction as a means of developing a\nsympathetic understanding.\n\nThe scholarship of philosopher Marilyn Fischer has revealed how\nsignificant social evolutionary thinking was for Addams. The\nOrigin of the Species was published in 1859, a year prior to\nAddams\u2019 birth. By the time Addams became a public intellectual,\nevolutionary thinking had not only become influential but was being\napplied to social phenomena as an explanatory narrative. Fischer\ndescribes, \u201cRecognizing Addams\u2019s use of social\nevolutionary discourse, set within imaginative forms, reveals the\nlogic and sensibility of her layered ethical analysis\u201d (Fischer\n2019, 13).\n\nAlthough Addams had a wide variety of influences, as we have seen, she\nwas not a derivative thinker, as many commentators suggest. She drew\nupon a number of great theorists to develop her ideas about social\nmorality but never dogmatically followed in anyone\u2019s footsteps.\nAll the while, she influenced many others as she made her unique\ncontributions to American and feminist philosophy.\n3. Addams\u2019 Standpoint Epistemology\n\nAlthough writing long before the term \u201cstandpoint\nepistemology\u201d was named by feminist philosophers, Addams can be\nconsidered a forerunner of standpoint epistemology, given her\ncommitment to sympathetic knowledge. Feminist philosophers have\nattended to the impact of context on theory more than mainstream\nphilosophers. Although there are lively debates within feminist\nphilosophical circles regarding the nature of objectivity, many,\nincluding Dorothy Smith, Nancy Hartsock, Hilary Rose, Alison Jaggar,\nand Sandra Harding, have developed the notion that knowledge is indeed\nsituated. In particular, feminist standpoint theorists valorize the\nperspectives and theories derived from oppressed societal positions,\nsuch as women\u2019s experiences. Harding describes a feminist\nstandpoint as something to achieve rather than a passive perspective.\nAll women have lived experience in a woman\u2019s body and therefore\nhave a woman\u2019s perspective. Still, a feminist standpoint\nrequires an effort at stepping back to gain a holistic picture of\npower struggles. Through the understanding of the perspectival aspect\nof knowledge claims, standpoint epistemology can create libratory\nknowledge that can be leveraged to subvert oppressive systems. One of\nthe challenges of standpoint theory is how to give voice to multiple\npositions without falling back on hierarchies that favor certain\nstandpoints over others.\n\nJane Addams demonstrates an appreciation for the spirit of standpoint\ntheory through her work and writing at Hull-House. Despite the\nprivileged social position she was born into, her settlement avocation\nimmersed her in disempowered communities. Addams poetically describes\nher moral mandate to meet, know, and understand others: \u201cWe know\nat last, that we can only discover truth by a rational and democratic\ninterest in life, and to give truth complete social expression is the\nendeavor upon which we are entering. Thus the identification with the\ncommon lot that is the essential idea of Democracy becomes the source\nand expression of social ethics. It is as though we thirsted at the\ngreat wells of human experience because we know that a daintier or\nless potent draught would not carry us to the end of the journey,\ngoing forward as we must in the heat and jostle of the crowd\u201d\n(DSE 9). One might object that although these are admirable\nsentiments, they are still spoken by an outsider. What constitutes an\noutsider? Addams lived the better part of a half-century in the\ndiverse immigrant neighborhood of Hull House in Chicago. She\ndidn\u2019t return home to the suburbs or return to a university\noffice with her data. She lived and worked amongst the crime, civic\ncorruption, prostitution, sweatshops, and other community ills. When\nthey started Hull House, Addams and Starr were involved\noutsiders\u2014an oddity that neighbors looked upon suspiciously.\nHowever, time, proximity, and an earnest desire to learn and help won\nthe trust and respect of the neighborhood. The outsiders became\ninsiders. When Addams wrote or spoke about single women laborers,\nchild laborers, prostitutes, or first and second-generation\nimmigrants, she employed first-hand knowledge gained from her social\ninteractions. Addams leveraged her Hull House experiences to give\nvoice to standpoints marginalized in society. Simultaneously, she\nworked to provide the oppressed their own voice through college\nextension courses, English language courses, and social clubs that\nfostered political and social debate. Addams was self-conscious about\nspeaking for others: \u201cI never addressed a Chicago audience on\nthe subject of the Settlement and its vicinity without inviting a\nneighbor to go with me, that I might curb my hasty generalization by\nthe consciousness that I had an auditor who knew the conditions more\nintimately than I could hope to do\u201d (TYH 80). Addams did not try\nto arrive at universal moral truths but recognized that the standpoint\nof Hull House neighbors mattered.\n\nIn an 1896 article in The American Journal of Sociology,\n\u201cA Belated Industry,\u201d Addams addresses the plight of women\nin domestic labor. These were the most powerless of laborers:\npredominantly women, many of them immigrants with limited English\nlanguage skills and in a job that afforded little legal protection or\norganizing possibilities. Addams begins the article with a footnote\nclaiming that her knowledge of domestic laborers comes from her\nexperience with the Woman\u2019s Labor Bureau, one of the many Hull\nHouse projects. Addams goes on to address the powerlessness of\ndomestic work, particularly as it entails isolation and a highly\ninequitable power relationship: \u201cThe household\nemploy\u00e9[sic] has no regular opportunity for meeting other\nworkers of her trade, and of attaining with them the dignity of\ncorporate body\u201d (ABI 538). Addams identifies the gendered\ndimension of this oppressive work: \u201cmen would \u2026 resent\nthe situation and consider it quite impossible if it implied the\ngiving up of their family and social ties, and living under the roof\nof the household requiring their services\u201d (ABI 540). Addams\nextrapolates her experience of these workers to imaginatively inhabit\na standpoint and give them voice. She explicitly claims as much,\n\u201cAn attempt is made to present this industry [domestic labor]\nfrom the point of view of those women who are working in households\nfor wages\u201d (ABI 536). Addams repeatedly recognized the\nexperiences of oppressed peoples that she came to know to have\ntheir concerns acknowledged in the social democracy she was trying to\nfoster.\n\nAddams believed recognizing alternative standpoints was important in\npromoting social progress through sympathetic understanding.\nAccordingly, if a voice is given to individuals inhabiting\nmarginalized positions in society, it fosters the possibility of\nbetter understanding between people and actions that can lead to\nimproving their lot. Addams engaged in the tricky balance of honoring\nstandpoints while simultaneously seeking connections and continuities\nto build upon. This is exemplified in Addams\u2019 books on young\npeople, Youth and the City Streets, and elderly women,\nThe Long Road of Woman\u2019s Memory. The latter work is a\ntreatise on memory based on the memories of first-generation immigrant\nwomen. Rather than grounding her theory upon the experiences of famous\nwomen theorists or writers\u2014and Addams knew most of the prominent\nwomen of her day\u2014Addams based her analysis on the women who were\nher neighbors at Hull House. Addams not only grounded her\nphilosophical work in experience but in the experiences of those on\nthe margins of society. Addams puts experience before theory. She did\nnot begin by positing a theory about these women. Instead, she retold\nmany stories she had heard from them and then drew out conclusions\nabout the function of memory. For Addams, theory follows experience.\nAddams was in the minority among her peers in philosophy or feminism\nto believe that working-class immigrant women not only should be given\na voice but also had something important to contribute to the\ncommunity of ideas.\n\nAn example of Addams\u2019 application of feminist standpoint theory\n(or at least a forerunner of it) can be seen in the \u201cDevil\nBaby,\u201d which recounts what transpired after three Italian women\ncame to Hull House to see a possessed infant. One can form a whimsical\nimage from Addams\u2019 account, \u201cNo amount of denial convinced\nthem that he was not there, for they knew exactly what he was like\nwith his cloven hoofs, his pointed ears, and diminutive tail; the\nDevil Baby had, moreover, been able to speak as soon as he was born\nand was shockingly profane\u201d (LRW 7\u20138). This would be an\namusing anecdote if it stopped there, but Addams described a six-week\nperiod when Hull House was inundated with stories about the alleged\nDevil Baby. Visitors even offered Hull House residents money to see\nthe creature despite adamant responses that there was no such baby.\nMultiple versions of how the Devil Baby arose in the neighborhood, and\neventually the hysteria made the newspapers. One version of the story\nclaimed that the Devil Baby was the offspring of an atheist and a\ndevoted Italian girl. When the husband tore a holy picture from the\nwall claiming that he would rather have a devil in the house, his wish\nwas granted in the form of his coming child (LRW 8). Although a\nfascinating social phenomenon, the Devil Baby story has little\napparent philosophical importance. It would be easy to dismiss those\nwho perpetuated the story as simpletons caught up in the hysteria. Not\nfor Jane Addams. She applied a familiar approach by refusing to pass\njudgment, listening carefully, and developing a sympathetic\nunderstanding. Addams actively worked to grasp their subject\nposition.\n\nAlthough Addams dismissed the \u201cgawkers\u201d who came to see\nthe Devil Baby as a sensationalist-seeking mob, she wanted to\nunderstand the older women who had perpetuated the myth:\n\u201cWhenever I heard the high eager voices of old women, I was\nirresistibly interested and left anything I might be doing in order to\nlisten to them\u201d (LRW 9). She found women who were solemn and\nhighly animated about the Devil Baby. They used the appearance of the\nDevil Baby and the excitement it created as an opportunity to discuss\nimportant and troubling matters of their life. Addams, who never\nsought simple answers to complex issues, found a convergence of class,\nrace, and gender dynamics fueling the Devil Baby phenomenon. These\nimmigrant women were in unfamiliar surroundings and had to adjust to\nforeign ideas and practices. They had been alienated by their\nchildren, who adapted to the new country more quickly, keeping the old\nways at arm\u2019s length. Many of these women also had been victims\nof domestic abuse long before such acts had a distinct label. One\nwoman tells Addams, \u201cMy face has this queer twist for now nearly\nsixty years; I was ten when it got that way, the night after I saw my\nfather do my mother to death with his knife\u201d (LRW 11). For these\nforgotten and beaten women, the Devil Baby represented a connection to\na past that made more sense to them: one that had clear moral\nimperatives. Another woman tells Addams, \u201cYou might say\nit\u2019s a disgrace to have your son beat you up for the sake of a\nbit of money you\u2019ve earned by scrubbing\u2014your own man is\ndifferent\u2014but I haven\u2019t the heart to blame the boy for\ndoing what he\u2019s seen all his life, his father forever went wild\nwhen the drink was in him and struck me to the very day of his death.\nThe ugliness was born in the boy as the marks of the Devil was born in\nthe poor child up-stairs\u201d (LRW 11). Addams\u2019 recounting of\ntale after tale of violence provides a depressing view of immigrant\nwomen\u2019s lives at the turn of the century. For women who had\nlived such a hard life, the Devil Baby provided a momentary\nopportunity for resistance. Husbands and children would listen to them\nand temporarily forsake beating them for fear of divine retribution as\nevinced by the Devil Baby. Addams describes memory as serving to\n\u201cmake life palatable and at rare moments even beautiful\u201d\n(LRW 28). Although this is a specific explanatory analysis, it\ndemonstrates how Addams sought connections among the personal stories:\n\u201cWhen these reminiscences, based upon the diverse experiences of\nmy people unknown to each other, point to one inevitable conclusion,\nthey accumulate into a social protest \u2026\u201d (LRW 29). Addams\nproceeds to view the Devil Baby in light of the women\u2019s movement\nand the fight against oppression. Given the position of the old women,\nthe Devil Baby was the vehicle of resistance and an opportunity for\nAddams to interject feminist analysis.\n4. Radical Meliorism\n\nMeliorism is a hallmark of pragmatist philosophy, which we can see in\nAddams\u2019 work with a more radical character than among other American\npragmatists. If \u201cradical\u201d is defined as challenging\nexisting power structures, Jane Addams was the least elitist and\nthe most radical of the American philosophers of her era. Addams\nconsistently took and eloquently supported inclusive positions that\nsought the benefit of society. While pragmatists typically advocated\nfor social progress, Addams radicalized the extent of that social\nprogress. Rather than defining progress by the best and brightest\nachievements, Addams advocates the betterment of all in what she calls\n\u201clateral progress.\u201d For Addams, lateral progress meant\nthat social advancement could not be declared through the\nbreakthroughs or peak performances of a few but could only\nauthentically be found in social gains held in common. Addams employs\nmetaphor to explain the concept:\n\n\nThe man who insists upon consent, who moves with the people, is bound\nto consult the feasible right as well as the absolute right. He is\noften obliged to attain only Mr. Lincoln\u2019s \u201cbest\npossible,\u201d and often have the sickening sense of compromising\nwith his best convictions. He has to move along with those whom he\nrules toward a goal that neither he nor they see very clearly till\nthey come to it. He has to discover what people really want, and then\n\u201cprovide the channels in which the growing moral force of their\nlives shall flow.\u201d What he does attain, however, is not the\nresult of his individual striving, as a solitary mountain climber\nbeyond the sight of the valley multitude, but it is underpinned and\nupheld by the sentiments and aspirations of many others. Progress has\nbeen slower perpendicularly, but incomparably greater because\nlateral.\n\nHe has not taught his contemporaries to climb mountains, but he has\npersuaded the villagers to move up a few feet higher. (AML 175)\n\n\nWhether one refers to them as \u201crobber barons\u201d or\n\u201ccaptains of industry,\u201d the rise of commerce in the United\nStates was defined by the winners of the game: those who amassed\nwealth. The wealthy enjoyed tremendous progress in healthcare,\neducation, and material well-being. Addams was not satisfied with\nnarrow social development and redefined progress according to the\ncommon person\u2019s experience. This redefinition continues to elude\nus today as class disparity in the United States grows. Ironically,\nAddams is often chastised for expounding middle-class values, which\nwas her point of reference as she started Hull House.\nStill, Addams\u2019 experiences pushed her to understand and\nappreciate the immigrant poor in the neighborhood more fully.\n\nAddams applied the idea of lateral progress to numerous issues. When\nshe discusses the role of labor unions, she argues that in their\nattempt to improve conditions for all workers, unions are fulfilling a\nvital function that society has abrogated. Addams, who had a track\nrecord of supporting labor, makes it clear that she does not view\ncollective bargaining as an end in itself. Instead, Addams views\nunions as trailblazers who obtain working conditions that eventually\nbenefit everyone in society: \u201ctrade unions are trying to do for\nthemselves what the government should secure for all its citizens;\nhas, in fact, secured in many cases\u201d (FSS 456). Addams is not\ninterested in improving the lot of one group of workers over another.\n\u201cAny sense of division and suspicion is fatal in a democratic\nform of government, for although each side may seem to secure most for\nitself when consulting only its own interests, the final test must be\nthe good of the community as a whole\u201d (FSS 461). For Addams,\nunions are important in as much as they improve working conditions,\nraise wages, reduce hours and eliminate child labor for all\nAmericans\u2014lateral progress.\n\nAlthough the first chapter of Addams\u2019 Democracy and Social\nEthics is ostensibly a critique of charity workers and their\npreconceived notions of the needs of the destitute, it also reveals\nAddams\u2019 disposition toward the poor and the oppressed. She\ndecries the historical position of blaming the victim:\n\u201cFormerly, when it was believed that poverty was synonymous with\nvice and laziness and that the prosperous man was the righteous man,\ncharity was administered harshly with a good conscience; for the\ncharitable agent really blamed the individual for his poverty, and the\nvery fact of his own superior prosperity gave him a certain\nconsciousness of superior morality\u201d (DSE 11\u201312). Such a\njudgment serves to separate the wealthy from the poor. Accordingly,\nthe rich can make progress intellectually, materially,\ntechnologically, etc., while the poor are thought to be left behind\nprimarily due to their own actions. Addams argues that the poor are\noften victims of circumstance and that it is society\u2019s responsibility\nto first understand marginalized people and then develop means for\ntheir participation in lateral progress.\n\nCharity, although a good, is not lateral progress. While noble, a\ntemporary transfer in wealth does not constitute real progress in\nalleviating economic disparity. Addams never viewed herself as a\ncharity worker, nor did she characterize the work of Hull House as\ncharity: \u201cI am always sorry to have Hull House regarded as\nphilanthropy\u201d (ONS 45). Addams sought lateral progress that\ncould be brought about by the collective will and manifested through\nsocial institutions. She believes there would be no need for\nsettlements if \u201csociety had been reconstructed to the point of\noffering equal opportunity for all\u201d (ONS 27). Addams is not\nadvocating a laissez-faire capitalism version of equal\nopportunity that is abstract and rights-based. Free market economics\ninfluences modern understandings of democracy as merely assuring the\nadequate opportunity to participate. Addams\u2019 approach to equal\nopportunity is set in a context of vibrant democracy where citizens\nand social organizations look out for one another because they all\nhave a stake in lateral progress or what today might be termed\ndemocratic socialism.\n\nAddams\u2019 radical pragmatism ultimately had a feminist dimension.\nShe continually gave voice to women\u2019s experiences, addressed\nwomen\u2019s issues, and saw a vibrant social democracy as only\npossible if there was full participation by both men and women. When\nit came to issues such as women\u2019s suffrage, Addams manifests a\nfeminist pragmatism. \u201cIf women had no votes with which to select\nthe men upon whom her social reform had become dependent, some\ncherished project might be so modified by uninformed legislatures\nduring the process of legal enactment that the law, as finally passed,\ninjured the very people it was meant to protect. Women had discovered\nthat the unrepresented are always liable to be given what they do not\nwant by legislators who merely wish to placate them\u201d (STY\n89\u201390). Note that Addams does not argue the application of\nabstract human rights, but she instead makes a functional claim about\nthe role of voting in proper democratic representation. It is not that\nAddams opposes rights, but she will continually opt for pragmatist\narguments on feminist issues. Her male pragmatist colleagues were\nsympathetic to feminist positions but did not make the claims as\nforcefully or consistently as Addams (Seigfried, 1996).\n\nAddams\u2019 notion of lateral progress exemplifies again how she has\nbeen misrepresented as merely a reformer. Radical discourse, a la\nMarx, has been associated with the call for extreme changes in social\ninstitutions and systems. Although such changes may be arguably\ndesirable, they entail upheaval that will disrupt social relationships\nat significant potential personal cost. Addams sought substantial\nsocial progress through mutual agreement and tapping into communal\nintelligence. Her radical vision refused to give up on the individuals\nin society and their caring relationships. Mixing theoretical notions\nof social change with concrete experiences of community organizing,\nAddams was a caring radical. Addams was interested in ameliorating\nsocial problems, but that does not preclude a broadly construed\nradical edge to her social philosophy.\n5. Socializing Care\n\nAn analysis of Addams\u2019 moral philosophy suggests at least three\nclaims about her relationship to feminist care ethics avant la\nlettre. One, Addams\u2019 approach to the important social\nissues of her day reflected the relationality and contextualization\nthat are important to what is called care ethics today. Two, although\nAddams employed caring in response to the needs of others, she\ncontributes an active, even assertive, dimension to care ethics not\ncommonly found in feminist theory. Third, Addams advocates what might\nbe called \u201csocializing care\u201d: systemically instantiating\nthe habits and practices of care in social institutions.\n\nAlthough care is a simple and widely invoked word, many feminist\ntheorists have invested it with a particular meaning as it applies to\nethics. The original motivation for developing care ethics was an\nacknowledgment that traditional forms of morality, in particular\nprinciple-based and consequence-based ethics, did not adequately\naddress the richness of the human condition. These approaches bracket\nout emotions, relationships, temporal considerations, reciprocity, and\ncreativity to focus on immediate adjudication of moral conflicts.\nAccordingly, the use of rules or consequences can become a\nreductionist and formulaic response resulting in shortsighted answers\nto complex and systemic issues. For care ethicists, principles can be\nuseful, but a concern for interpersonal connection tempers them.\nPrinciples and consequences can be important in moral\ndeliberation, but care theorists seek a more robust and complex sense\nof morality that cannot ignore the context and people involved. For\nexample, the claim that people who spray-paint graffiti on a building\nought to be punished because they have damaged someone else\u2019s\nproperty (rule/principle violation) will likely receive widespread\nassent. Care ethicists do not necessarily deny such an assertion, but\nthey want to know more. The person doing the spray-painting is a human\nbeing whose motivations and circumstances may reveal other variables\nnot sufficiently addressed by the mere recognition of rule violations.\nSystemic issues involving social opportunities, discrimination, or\nlack of voice may have contributed to this behavior. Care ethicists\nshift the moral focus from abstract individuals and their actions to\nconcrete, situated people with feelings, friends, and\ndreams\u2014persons who can be cared about. Care ethics demands\neffort, experience, knowledge, imagination, and empathy to effectively\nunderstand the totality of the moral context. The result is not an\nexoneration of personal responsibility but a richer understanding of\nthe human condition where we are all actors and acted upon.\n\nAddams consistently moves beyond formulaic moral accounts of\nprinciples or consequences to apply a kind of care ethics to her\nexperiences in the Hull House neighborhood. Proximity is once again\ncrucial as she has direct experience with individuals, providing the\nresources for a caring response. However, as a philosopher, Addams\nextrapolates her experiences to theorize about others of similar\ncircumstances. For example, in The Spirit of Youth and the City\nStreets Addams addresses juvenile delinquency. She recounts\ncharges against young men who were brought before the Juvenile Court\nin Chicago (which Hull House had helped establish). These charges were\ncategorized by type, such as stealing, which included the pilfering of\npigeons, blankets, and a bicycle. Another category was disorderly\nconduct which included picking up coal from railroad tracks, throwing\nstones at railroad employees, and breaking down a fence. There was\nalso vagrancy, which included loafing, sleeping on the streets all\nnight, and wandering (SYC 56\u201357). Addams does not deny the\nseriousness of some of these infractions, but she does not rush to\njudgment, instead choosing to investigate the context further. She\ntalks to the young men and asks them about their motivations. She\nidentifies a listlessness, a desire for adventure not quieted by what\nthe city has to offer: \u201ctheir very demand for excitement is a\nprotest against the dullness of life, to which we ourselves\ninstinctively respond\u201d (SYC 71). Addams views the city as built\naround the possibility of factory production but ignores the needs of\nfuture workers. Among \u201cjuvenile delinquents,\u201d Adams\nfinds many young people who simply seek adventure and excitement\nbecause their lives have little of it. Had Addams merely abstracted\nyouth as a category of individuals who seem prone to break the law,\nshe could have easily found principles to judge them negatively.\nHowever, Addams saw them as humans, many of whom she witnessed growing\nup in the neighborhood, and she cared for them beyond the alienating\nlabel of \u201ctroubled youth.\u201d\n\nMore than merely prefiguring care ethics, Addams infuses a high social\nresponsibility standard into this moral approach. Addams advocates a\nduty of social awareness and engagement, thus creating the potential\nfor care. Many care ethicists are wary of the notion of duty as it has\nbeen traditionally formulated. Moral duties have historically entailed\nclaims regarding actions that a person is required to offer on behalf\nof another. Because the \u201cother\u201d is an abstract other and\nthe requirements are universalized (I must act in such a way in all\ncases), duties toward others have tended toward moral minimums of\nobligation. For example, a moral obligation to act is present if\nsomeone\u2019s life is in peril and minimal effort is required to\nprevent it, such as an infant drowning in 3 inches of bathwater.\nAlthough such cases get widespread agreement, it becomes more\nchallenging to ascertain what obligation one has to distant others\nwith unclear expectations of success. For example, many Americans have\ndisposable income that could save the life of someone in a\npoverty-stricken country on a distant continent; do they have a moral\nobligation to give them money, and to what extent? Addams constructs\nthe duty to care differently. Hers is an epistemological demand.\nAddams claims that good citizens actively pursue knowledge of\nothers\u2014not just facts but a more profound\nunderstanding\u2014for the possibility of caring and acting on their\nbehalf: \u201cif we grow contemptuous of our fellows, and consciously\nlimit our intercourse to certain kinds of people whom we have\npreviously decided to respect, we not only tremendously circumscribe\nour range of life, but limit our scope of ethics\u201d (DSE 8). For\nAddams, care ethics must be actively pursued, not passively fostered.\nAddams\u2019 language is more assertive than much of the current care\nethics discourse.\n\nFinally, Addams extends care ethics to the public realm. She is not\ncontent to compartmentalize personal and social morality. Caring is\nwhat she desires for democracy and its various institutions. Addams\nviews the residents of social settlements, for example, as having\n\u201can opportunity of seeing institutions from the\nrecipient\u2019s standpoint\u201d because they are not distant\ninstitutions but neighbors. She finds this perspective significant and\nbelieves that it should ultimately \u201cfind expression in\ninstitutional management\u201d (OVS 39). Furthermore, she\ndifferentiates the epistemological project of the settlement from the\nuniversity in language that acknowledges a caring element: \u201cThe\nsettlement stands for application as opposed to research; for emotion\nas opposed to abstraction, for universal interest as opposed to\nspecialization\u201d (FSS 189). While social settlements epitomize a\ndemocratic endeavor for Addams, she applies the same caring values to\nother institutions. The creation of the juvenile courts in Chicago\nrepresented an example of caring because it mandated contextualized\nregard for the context of young people. The creation of adult\neducation that addressed tangible and contemporary issues also\ndemonstrated a caring regard for the needs of Hull-House neighbors.\nPerhaps most of all, the comportment of the Hull-House residents\nmanifested care ethics in their willingness to listen, learn and\nrespond. Addams viewed socializing care as participating in a rich\nideal of democracy.\n",
