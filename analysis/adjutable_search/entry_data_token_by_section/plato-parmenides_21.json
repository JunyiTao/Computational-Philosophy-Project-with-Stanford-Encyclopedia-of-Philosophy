Conclusion\n\n\nScholars are deeply divided about the central interpretive questions\nrelating to a proper understanding of Plato\u2019s\nParmenides. What is the point of Parmenides\u2019\ncriticisms of Socrates\u2019 theory of forms, taken both individually\nand collectively, in the first part of the dialogue? What is the\npoint of Parmenides\u2019 instantiation of his own recommended method\nof training in the second part of the dialogue? And how, in\nparticular, is the second part of the dialogue supposed to bear on the\nfirst?\n\n\nIt is possible that the dialogue as a whole is a kind of satire (Tabak\n(2015)), but given the logical connections both within and across its\nparts, the satirical hypothesis is unlikely.\n\n\nFor some, Parmenides\u2019 criticisms are no more than a \u201crecord\nof honest perplexity\u201d (see Vlastos (1954, 343); Gill (1996; 2012);\nAllen (1997)). On this view, Plato\u2019s intention was simply\nto put forward difficulties for the theory of forms that he himself did\nnot, at least at the time he wrote the dialogue, see a way to\nresolve. The main problem for this interpretation is that, after\nhaving laid out his criticisms of the theory, Parmenides says that it\nshould be possible for a \u201cvery gifted man\u201d to defend the\nexistence of the forms, and thereby explain the possibility of\ndialectic, through a method of training that Parmenides himself goes on\nto instantiate in the second part of the dialogue.\n\n\nFor others, Parmenides\u2019 criticisms are fallacies that someone who\nfollows Parmenides\u2019 recommended method of training will thereby be in\na position to diagnose. On this view, the theory of forms emerges\nrelatively intact at the end of the dialogue. The most influential\nversion of this view belongs to Meinwald (1991; 1992; 2014) and Peterson\n(1996; 2000; 2003). According to Meinwald, Plato meant us to recognize\nthe invalidity of Parmenides\u2019 criticisms of the theory of forms by\nhaving us focus on the in-relation-to qualifications that are\nsupposed to serve as one of the principles of division that explain\nthe fact that the second part takes the shape of eight separate\nDeductions. These qualifications, properly understood, reveal that\nsubject-predicate sentences (of the form \u201cX\nis F\u201d) are ambiguous: to say that X\nis F is to say\neither that X is F in relation to\nitself (i.e.,\npros heauto) or that X is F in\nrelation to the others (i.e., pros ta alla), where to\nsay that X is F\npros heauto is to say that the F is definitionally\ntrue of X, and to say that X is F pros\nta alla is to say that X displays the feature of\nbeing F. As Meinwald argues, if Plato meant us to recognize\nthe existence of such an ambiguity, then he probably meant us to\nrecognize that self-predicational sentences (of the form \u201cThe\nF is F\u201d) are also ambiguous, and that the\nambiguity of such sentences reveals that the Third Man argument and\nthe Greatest Difficulty commit the fallacy of equivocation. The main\nproblem with this particular interpretive strategy is that it is\nprovably false that all versions of the Third Man argument\n(or Greatest Difficulty) come out fallacious if self-predicational\nsentences are ambiguous as between pros heauto and pros\nta alla readings. (For details, see Frances (1996).)\n\n\nThere are other interpretations that are similar to the one defended by\nMeinwald and Peterson. Miller (1986), for example, argues that a\ndiscerning reader who is able to look beneath the surface of the text\nis in a position to recognize that Parmenides\u2019 criticisms are\neffective only on the wrong-headed supposition that forms are\nfundamentally similar to the sensible, material things that partake of\nthem. The point of the dialogue, on this view, is to help the\ndiscerning reader see the forms for what they really are, transcendent\nbeings that should be accessed by reason rather than with the help of\ncategories drawn from sense experience. One of the problems with\nsuch an interpretation is a problem that is common to esoteric readings\nin general: once one has left the surface of the text, there are no\ninterpretive constraints on what one might find beneath the\nsurface. Virtually any interpretation will turn out to\nbe justified by the text. Another problem with this approach is\nthat it pays insufficient attention to the logical interconnections\namong individual criticisms of the theory of forms, and between the\ncriticisms as a whole and the Deductions.\n\n\nThere is another way of answering the three central interpretive\nquestions, one on which Parmenides\u2019 criticisms as well as the\nDeductions come out as serious and valid. (This is the interpretation\ndefended in Rickless (2007), and one aspect of which is defended,\nthough on different grounds, in Gill (2014).) What Parmenides\u2019\ncriticisms reveal is that, whether combined with the Pie Model\nconception of partaking or with Paradigmatism, Plato\u2019s middle period\ntheory of forms is internally inconsistent. It turns out that there\nare three principles the abandonment of which would eliminate all\ninconsistencies apart from the Greatest Difficulty: Purity-F,\nUniqueness, and No Causation by Contraries. Careful logical analysis\nof the second part of the dialogue then reveals that the Deductions\nestablish not only that the forms posited by the middle period theory\nexist, but also that Purity-F, Uniqueness, and No Causation by\nContraries are all false. It is then reasonable to suppose that Plato\nmeant the reader to recognize that the proper way to save the forms is\nby abandoning these three basic assumptions.  And, importantly, this\ncan be done without abandoning the most important principles at the\nheart of the middle period theory, namely One-over-Many and\nSeparation. The aptly-named Greatest Difficulty is then left as a\nchallenge for future work.\n",
