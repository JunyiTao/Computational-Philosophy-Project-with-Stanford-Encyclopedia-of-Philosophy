    "main_text": "The Doctrine of the Mean || Ethical Theory Does Not Offer a Decision Procedure\n5.2 Ethical Theory Does Not Offer a Decision Procedure\n\nIt should be clear that neither the thesis that virtues lie between\nextremes nor the thesis that the good person aims at what is\nintermediate is intended as a procedure for making decisions. These\ndoctrines of the mean help show what is attractive about the virtues,\nand they also help systematize our understanding of which qualities\nare virtues. Once we see that temperance, courage, and other generally\nrecognized characteristics are mean states, we are in a position to\ngeneralize and to identify other mean states as virtues, even though\nthey are not qualities for which we have a name. Aristotle remarks,\nfor example, that the mean state with respect to anger has no name in\nGreek (1125b26\u20137). Though he is guided to some degree by\ndistinctions captured by ordinary terms, his methodology allows him to\nrecognize states for which no names exist.\n\nSo far from offering a decision procedure, Aristotle insists that this\nis something that no ethical theory can do. His theory elucidates the\nnature of virtue, but what must be done on any particular occasion by\na virtuous agent depends on the circumstances, and these vary so much\nfrom one occasion to another that there is no possibility of stating a\nseries of rules, however complicated, that collectively solve every\npractical problem. This feature of ethical theory is not unique;\nAristotle thinks it applies to many crafts, such as medicine and\nnavigation (1104a7\u201310). He says that the virtuous person\n\u201csees the truth in each case, being as it were a standard and\nmeasure of them\u201d (1113a32\u20133); but this appeal to the good\nperson\u2019s vision should not be taken to mean that he has an\ninarticulate and incommunicable insight into the truth. Aristotle\nthinks of the good person as someone who is good at deliberation, and\nhe describes deliberation as a process of rational inquiry. The\nintermediate point that the good person tries to find is\n\n\ndetermined by logos (\u201creason\u201d,\n\u201caccount\u201d) and in the way that the person of practical\nreason would determine it. (1107a1\u20132)\n\n\nTo say that such a person \u201csees\u201d what to do is simply a\nway of registering the point that the good person\u2019s reasoning\ndoes succeed in discovering what is best in each situation. He is\n\u201cas it were a standard and measure\u201d in the sense that his\nviews should be regarded as authoritative by other members of the\ncommunity. A standard or measure is something that settles disputes;\nand because good people are so skilled at discovering the mean in\ndifficult cases, their advice must be sought and heeded.\n\nAlthough there is no possibility of writing a book of rules, however\nlong, that will serve as a complete guide to wise decision-making, it\nwould be a mistake to attribute to Aristotle the opposite position,\nnamely that every purported rule admits of exceptions, so that even a\nsmall rule-book that applies to a limited number of situations is an\nimpossibility. He makes it clear that certain emotions (spite,\nshamelessness, envy) and actions (adultery, theft, murder) are always\nwrong, regardless of the circumstances (1107a8\u201312). Although he\nsays that the names of these emotions and actions convey their\nwrongness, he should not be taken to mean that their wrongness derives\nfrom linguistic usage. He defends the family as a social institution\nagainst the criticisms of Plato (Politics II.3\u20134), and\nso when he says that adultery is always wrong, he is prepared to argue\nfor his point by explaining why marriage is a valuable custom and why\nextra-marital intercourse undermines the relationship between husband\nand wife. He is not making the tautological claim that wrongful sexual\nactivity is wrong, but the more specific and contentious point that\nmarriages ought to be governed by a rule of strict fidelity.\nSimilarly, when he says that murder and theft are always wrong, he\ndoes not mean that wrongful killing and taking are wrong, but that the\ncurrent system of laws regarding these matters ought to be strictly\nenforced. So, although Aristotle holds that ethics cannot be reduced\nto a system of rules, however complex, he insists that some rules are\ninviolable.\n",
