    "preamble": "\n\nMoral arguments for God\u2019s existence form a diverse family of\narguments that reason from some feature of morality or the moral life\nto the existence of God, usually understood as a morally good creator\nof the universe. Moral arguments are both important and interesting.\nThey are interesting because evaluating their soundness requires\nattention to practically every important philosophical issue dealt\nwith in metaethics. They are important because of their prominence in\npopular apologetic arguments for religious belief. Evidence for this\ncan be found in the amazing popularity of C. S. Lewis\u2019s Mere\nChristianity (1952), which is almost certainly the best-selling\nbook of apologetics in the twentieth century, and which begins with a\nmoral argument for God\u2019s existence. Many ordinary people regard\nreligion as in some way providing a basis or foundation for morality.\nThis fact might seem to favor religious arguments for morality rather\nthan moral arguments for religious belief, but if someone believes\nthat morality is in some way \u201cobjective\u201d or\n\u201creal,\u201d and that this moral reality requires explanation,\nmoral arguments for God\u2019s reality naturally suggest themselves.\nThe apparent connection between morality and religion appears to many\npeople to support the claim that moral truths require a religious\nfoundation, or can best be explained by God\u2019s existence, or some\nqualities or actions of God.\n\nAfter some general comments about theistic arguments and a brief\nhistory of moral arguments, this essay will discuss several different\nforms of the moral argument. A major distinction is that between moral\narguments that are theoretical in nature and practical or pragmatic\narguments. The former are best thought of as arguments that begin with\nalleged moral facts and argue that God is necessary to explain those\nfacts, or at least that God provides a better explanation of them than\nsecular accounts can offer. The latter typically begin with claims\nabout some good or end that morality requires and argue that this end\nis not attainable unless God exists. Whether this distinction is hard\nand fast will be one of the questions to be discussed, as some argue\nthat practical arguments by themselves cannot be the basis of rational\nbelief. To meet such concerns practical arguments may have to include\na theoretical dimension as well.\n",

    "main_text": "\n1. The Goals of Theistic Arguments\n\nBefore attempting to explain and assess moral arguments for the\nexistence of God, it would be helpful to have some perspective on the\ngoals of arguments for God\u2019s existence. (We shall generically\nterm arguments for God\u2019s existence \u201ctheistic\narguments.\u201d) Of course views about this are diverse, but most\ncontemporary proponents of such arguments do not see theistic\narguments as attempted \u201cproofs,\u201d in the sense that they\nare supposed to provide valid arguments with premises that no\nreasonable person could deny. Such a standard of achievement would\nclearly be setting the bar for success very high, and proponents of\ntheistic arguments rightly note that philosophical arguments for\ninteresting conclusions in any field outside of formal logic hardly\never reach such a standard. \n\nMore reasonable questions to ask about theistic arguments would seem\nto be the following: Are there valid arguments for the conclusion that\nGod exists that have premises that are known or reasonably believed by\nsome people? Are the premises of such arguments more reasonable than\ntheir denials, at least for some reasonable people? Arguments that\nmeet these standards could have value in making belief in God\nreasonable for some people, or even giving some people knowledge of\nGod\u2019s existence, even if it turns out that some of the premises\nof the arguments can be reasonably denied by other people, and thus\nthat the arguments fail as proofs.\n\nA major issue that cannot be settled here concerns the question of\nwhere the burden of proof lies with respect to theistic arguments.\nMany secular philosophers follow Antony Flew (1976) in holding that\nthere is a \u201cpresumption of atheism.\u201d On this view,\nbelieving in God is like believing in the Loch Ness Monster or\nleprechauns, something that reasonable people do not do without\nsufficient evidence. If such evidence is lacking, the proper stance is\natheism rather than agnosticism.\n\nThis \u201cpresumption of atheism\u201d has been challenged in a\nnumber of ways. Alvin Plantinga (2000) has argued that reasonable\nbelief in God does not have to be based on propositional evidence, but\ncan be \u201cproperly basic.\u201d On this view, reasonable belief\nin God can be the outcome of a basic faculty (called\nthe sensus divinitatis by theologian John Calvin)\nand thus needs no support from arguments at all. In response some\nwould argue that even if theistic belief is not grounded in\npropositional evidence, it still might require non-propositional\nevidence (such as experience), so it is not clear that\nPlantinga\u2019s view by itself removes the burden of proof\nchallenge.\n\nA second way to challenge the presumption of atheism is to question an\nimplicit assumption made by those who defend such a presumption, which\nis that belief in God is epistemologically more risky than unbelief.\nThe assumption might be defended in the following way: One might think\nthat theists and atheists share a belief in many entities: atoms,\nmiddle-sized physical objects, animals, and stars, for example.\nSomeone, however, who believes in leprechauns or sea monsters in\naddition to these commonly accepted objects thereby incurs a burden of\nproof. Such a person believes in \u201cone additional thing\u201d\nand thus seems to incur additional epistemological risk. One might\nthink that belief in God is relevantly like belief in a leprechaun or\nsea monster, and thus that the theist also bears an additional burden\nof proof. Without good evidence in favor of belief in God the safe\noption is to refrain from belief.\n\nHowever, the theist may hold that this account does not accurately\nrepresent the situation. Instead, the theist may argue that the debate\nbetween atheism and theism is not simply an argument about whether\n\u201cone more thing\u201d exists in the world. In fact, God is not\nto be understood as an entity in the world at all; any such entity\nwould by definition not be God. The debate is rather a debate about\nthe character of the universe. The theist believes that every object\nin the natural world exists because God creates and conserves that\nobject; every finite thing has the character of being dependent on\nGod. The atheist denies this and affirms that the basic entities in\nthe natural world have the character of existing \u201con their\nown.\u201d \n\nIf this is the right way to think about the debate, then it is not\nobvious that atheism is safer than theism. The debate is not about the\nexistence of one object, but the character of the universe as a whole.\nBoth parties are making claims about the character of everything in\nthe natural world, and both claims seem risky. This point is\nespecially important in dealing with moral arguments for theism, since\none of the questions raised by such arguments is the adequacy of a\nnaturalistic worldview in explaining morality. Such accounts need to\nexplain without watering the categories of morality down or otherwise\ndomesticating them and thereby depriving them of their most\ninteresting features. Evidentialists may properly ask about the\nevidence for theism, but it also seems proper to ask about the\nevidence for atheism if the atheist is committed to a rival metaphysic\nsuch as naturalism.\n2. History of Moral Arguments for God\u2019s Existence\n\nSomething that resembles a moral argument for God\u2019s existence,\nor at least an argument from value, can be found in the fourth of\nThomas Aquinas\u2019s \u201cFive Ways\u201d (Aquinas\n1265\u20131274, I, 1, 3). Aquinas there begins with the claim that\namong beings who possess such qualities as \u201cgood, true, and\nnoble\u201d there are gradations. Presumably he means that some\nthings that are good are better than other good things; perhaps some\nnoble people are nobler than others who are noble. In effect Aquinas\nis claiming that when we \u201cgrade\u201d things in this way we\nare, at least implicitly, comparing them to some absolute standard.\nAquinas believes this standard cannot be merely \u201cideal\u201d or\n\u201chypothetical,\u201d and thus this gradation is only possible\nif there is some being which has this quality to a\n\u201cmaximum\u201d extent: \u201cso that there is something which\nis truest, something best, something noblest and, consequently,\nsomething which is uttermost being; for those things that are greatest\nin truth are greatest in being, as it is written in Metaph. Ii.\u201d\nAquinas goes on to affirm that this being which provides the standard\nis also the cause or explanation of the existence of these qualities,\nand such a cause must be God. Obviously, this argument draws deeply on\nPlatonic and Aristotelian assumptions that are no longer widely held\nby philosophers. For the argument to be plausible today, such\nassumptions would have to be defended, or else the argument\nreformulated in a way that frees it from its original metaphysical\nhome.\n\nProbably the most influential versions of the moral argument for\nbelief in God can be traced to Kant (1788 [1956]), who famously argued\nthat the theoretical arguments for God\u2019s existence were\nunsuccessful, but presented a rational argument for belief in God as a\n\u201cpostulate of practical reason.\u201d Kant held that a\nrational, moral being must necessarily will \u201cthe highest\ngood,\u201d which consists of a world in which people are both\nmorally good and happy, and in which moral virtue is the condition for\nhappiness. The latter condition implies that this end must be sought\nsolely by moral action. However, Kant held that a person cannot\nrationally will such an end without believing that moral actions can\nsuccessfully achieve such an end, and this requires a belief that the\ncausal structure of nature is conducive to the achievement of this end\nby moral means. This is equivalent to belief in God, a moral being who\nis ultimately responsible for the character of the natural world.\nKant\u2019s arguments will be discussed later in this article.\n\nKant-inspired arguments were prominent in the nineteenth century, and\ncontinued to be important right up to the middle of the twentieth\ncentury. Such arguments can be found, for example, in W. R. Sorley\n(1918), Hastings Rashdall (1920), and A. E. Taylor (1945/1930).\nAlthough Henry Sidgwick was not himself a proponent of a moral\nargument for God\u2019s existence, some have argued that his thought\npresents the materials for such an argument (see Walls and Baggett\n2011). In the nineteenth century John Henry Newman (1870) also made\ngood use of a moral argument in his case for belief in God, developing\nwhat could be called an argument from conscience.\n\nBesides those luminaries from the history of the moral argument,\nseveral other figures made contributions of various sorts to the\ndiscussion, including Arthur Balfour (1915), Andrew Seth\nPringle-Pattison (1920), Clement Webb (2012), W. G. de Burgh (1938),\nW. R. Matthews (1921), Austin Farrer (2012), and H. P. Owen (1965). A\nchronicle of much of this history was published by Walls and Baggett\n(2019). Recovering such history is a helpful antidote to the\nahistorical character of much contemporary analytic philosophy.\n\nIn recent philosophy there has been a revival of divine command\nmetaethical theories, which has in turn led to new versions of the\nmoral argument found in such thinkers as Robert Adams (1987), John\nHare (1996), and C. Stephen Evans (2010). Work on divine command\ntheory, both in favor and against, has experienced a recent resurgence\nof interest. This work has encompassed both motivations for and\nformulations of divine command theory, as well as extensive discussion\nof both old and new objections to it.\n\nHowever, it is important to see that there are versions of the moral\nargument for God\u2019s existence that are completely independent of\nsuch a divine command theory, and this possibility can be seen in\narguments developed by Angus Ritchie (2012) and Mark Linville (2009).\nPerhaps the most extensive and developed account of a moral argument\nfor God\u2019s existence in recent philosophy is found in David\nBaggett and Jerry L. Walls (2016). This book examines a comprehensive\ncumulative form of moral argument and extensively explores underlying\nissues. It goes without saying that these renewed arguments have\nengendered new criticisms as well. Theoretical moral arguments for\nGod\u2019s existence can be understood as variations on the following\ntemplate:\n\nThere are objective\nmoral facts.\nGod provides the best\nexplanation of the existence of objective moral facts.\nTherefore, (probably)\nGod exists.\n\n\nAs we shall see, there are a variety of features of morality that can\nbe appealed to in the first steps of the arguments, as well as a\nvariety of ways in which God might be thought to provide an\nexplanation of those features in the second steps. The use of the\nsomewhat vague phrase \u201cobjective moral facts\u201d is intended\nto allow for this variety in Premise 1. The similarly vague notion of\nGod providing the best explanation of such facts allows for the\nvariety of ways moral features may depend on God\u2014divine commands\none salient option among them. Both types of premises are obviously\nopen to challenge. For example, the first premise of such an argument\ncan be challenged by popular metaethical views that see morality as\n\u201csubjective,\u201d or \u201cexpressive,\u201d rather than\nsomething that consists of objective facts. Moral skeptics and\n\u201cerror theorists\u201d also challenge the first premise. The\nsecond premise can be challenged on the basis of rival explanations of\nthe features of morality, explanations that do not require God.\nArguments about the second premise then may require comparison between\ntheistic explanations of morality and these rival views, with an\nattentive eye on the relevant evidence in need of explanation.\n\nIt is easy to see then that the proponent of a moral argument has a\ncomplex task: She must defend the reality and objectivity of the\nfeature of morality appealed to, but also defend the claim that this\nfeature can be best explained by God. The second part of the task may\nrequire not only demonstrating the strengths of a theistic\nexplanation, but pointing out weaknesses in rival secular explanations\nas well. Both parts of the task are essential, but it is worth noting\nthat the two components cannot be accomplished simultaneously. The\ntheist must defend the reality of morality against subjectivists,\nconstructivists, and \u201cmoral nihilists.\u201d Assuming that this\ntask has been carried out, the theist must then try to show that\nmorality thus understood requires or at least is most plausibly\nunderstood by  a theistic explanation.\n\nIt is interesting to observe, however, that with respect to both parts\nof the task, the theist may enlist non-theists as allies. The theist\nmay well make common cause with ethical naturalists as well as ethical\nnon-naturalists in defending moral realism against\n\u201cprojective\u201d theories such as expressivism. However, the\ntheist may also enlist the support of error theorists such as J. L.\nMackie (1977), and moral nihilists such as Friedrich Nietzsche (1887)\nin arguing that God is necessary for objective morality. Nietzsche,\nfor example, explicitly holds that God does not exist, but also claims\nthat God\u2019s non-existence undermines the reality of traditional\nwestern morality. The fact that theists can enlist such unlikely\nallies does not mean the moral argument for God\u2019s existence is\nsound, but it does suggest that the argument is not obviously\nquestion-begging, since both premises are sometimes accepted by\n(different) non-believers.\n3. Theoretical Moral Arguments for God\u2019s Existence and Divine Command Theories of Moral Obligation\n\nOne easily understandable version of a theistic moral argument relies\non an analogy between human laws promulgated by nation-states and\nmoral laws. Sovereign states enact laws that make certain acts\nforbidden or required. If I am a U. S. citizen, and I earn more than a\nsmall amount of money I am obligated to file an income tax return each\nyear. I am also forbidden, because of the laws that hold in the United\nStates, to discriminate in hiring on the basis of sex, age, or race.\nMany people believe that there are moral laws that bind individuals in\nthe same way that political laws do. I am obligated by a moral\nprinciple not to lie to others, and I am similarly obligated to keep\npromises that I have made. (Both legal and moral laws may be\nunderstood as holding prima facie, so that in some\nsituations a person must violate one law in order to obey a more\nimportant one.)\n\nWe know how human laws come into existence. They are enacted by\nlegislatures (or absolute monarchs in some countries) who have the\nauthority to pass such laws. How then should the existence of moral\nlaws be explained? It seems plausible to many to hold that they must\nbe similarly grounded in some appropriate  authority, and the\n or best candidate to fulfill this role is God. Some philosophers\nhave dismissed an argument of this type as \u201ccrude,\u201d\npresumably because its force is so obvious that no special\nphilosophical training is necessary to understand it and see its\nappeal. The fact that one can understand the argument without much in\nthe way of philosophical skill is not necessarily a defect, however.\nIf one supposes that there is a God, and that God wants humans to know\nhim and relate to him, one would expect God to make his reality known\nto humans in very obvious ways (See Evans 2010). After all, critics of\ntheistic belief, such as J. L. Schellenberg (1993), have argued that\nthe fact that God\u2019s reality is not obvious to those who would\nlike to believe in God is a grave problem. If an awareness of moral\nobligations is in fact an awareness of God\u2019s commands or divine\nlaws, then the ordinary person who is aware of moral obligations does\nhave a kind of awareness of God. Of course such a person might be\naware of God\u2019s laws without realizing that they are God\u2019s\nlaws; she might be aware of God\u2019s commands without being aware\nof them under that description. The religious apologist might view\nsuch a person as already having a kind of de\nre awareness of God, because a moral obligation is simply an\nexpression of God\u2019s will (or God\u2019s command or motivation,\npreference or desire).\n\nHow can such an awareness be converted into full-fledged belief in\nGod? One way of doing this would be to help the person gain the skills\nneeded to recognize moral laws as what they are, as\ndivine commands or divine laws. If moral laws are experienced, then\nmoral experience could be viewed as a kind of religious experience or\nat least a proto-religious experience. Perhaps someone who has\nexperience of God in this way does not need a moral argument (or any\nkind of argument) to have a reasonable belief in God. This may be one\ninstance of the kind of case that Alvin Plantinga (2000) and the\n\u201cReformed epistemologists\u201d have in mind when they claim\nthat belief in God can be \u201cproperly basic.\u201d It is worth\nnoting then that there could be such a thing as knowledge of God that\nis rooted in moral experience without that knowledge being the result\nof a moral argument.\n\nEven if that is the case, however, a moral argument could still play a\nvaluable role. Such an argument might be one way of helping an\nindividual understand that moral obligations are in fact divine\ncommands or laws. Even if it were true that some ordinary people might\nknow that God exists without argument, an argument could be helpful in\ndefending the claim that this is the case. A person\nmight conceivably need an argument for the second-level\nclaim that the person knows God without\nargument.\n\nIn any case a divine command metaethical theory provides the material\nfor such an argument. The revival of divine command theories (DCT) of\nmoral obligation is due mainly to the work of Philip Quinn (1979/1978)\nand Robert Adams (1999). Adams\u2019 version of a DCT has been\nparticularly influential and is well-suited for the defense of the\nclaim that moral knowledge can provide knowledge of God. Adams\u2019\nversion of a DCT is an account of\nmoral obligations and it must be distinguished from\nmore general \u201cvoluntarist\u201d views of ethics that try to\ntreat other moral properties (such as the good) as dependent on\nGod\u2019s will. As explained below, by limiting the theory to\nobligations, Adams avoids the standard\n\u201cEuthyphro\u201d objection, which claims that divine\ncommand views reduce ethics to arbitrariness. \n\nAdams\u2019 account of moral obligations as divine commands rests on\na more general social theory of obligations. There are of course many\ntypes of obligations: legal obligations, financial obligations,\nobligations of etiquette, and obligations that hold in virtue of\nbelonging to some club or association, to name just a few. Clearly\nthese obligations are distinct from moral obligations, since in some\ncases moral obligations can conflict with these other kinds. What is\ndistinctive about obligations in general? They are not reducible\nsimply to normative claims about what a person has a good reason to\ndo. \n\nJ. S. Mill (1874, 164\u2013165) argued that we can explain normative\nprinciples without making any reference to God. He contends that the\n\u201cfeeling of obligation\u201d stems from \u201csomething that\nthe internal conscience bears witness to in its own nature,\u201d and\nthus the moral law, unlike human laws, \u201cdoes not originate in\nthe will of a legislator or legislature external to the mind.\u201d\nDoubtless Mill had in mind here such normative logical principles as\n\u201cit is wrong to believe\nboth p and not-p at the same\ntime.\u201d Mill argues that such normative principles hold without\nany requirement for an \u201cauthority\u201d to be their ground, and\nhe thinks this is plausible for the case of moral principles as well.\nMill\u2019s view is plausible at least for some normative principles,\nthough some theists have argued that metaphysical naturalists have\ndifficulty in explaining any kind of normativity (see Devine 1989,\n88\u201389). However, even if Mill is correct about normativity in\ngeneral, it does not follow that his view is correct for moral\nobligations, which have a special character. An obligation has a\nspecial kind of force; we should care about complying with it, and\nviolations of obligations appropriately incur blame (Adams 1999, 235).\nIf I make a logical mistake, I may feel silly or stupid or\nembarrassed, but I have no reason to feel guilty, unless the mistake\nreflects some carelessness on my part that itself constitutes a\nviolation of a moral obligation. Adams argues that \u201cfacts of\nobligation are constituted by broadly social requirements.\u201d\n(ibid, 233) For example, the social role of parenting is partly\nconstituted by the obligations one assumes by becoming a parent, and\nthe social role of citizen is partly constituted by the obligations to\nobey the laws of the country in which one is a citizen.\n\nAll obligations are then constituted by social requirements, according\nto Adams. However, not all obligations constituted by social\nrequirements are moral obligations. What social relation could be the\nbasis of moral obligations? Adams argues that not just any human\nsocial relation will possess the requisite authority:\n\u201cA morally valid obligation obviously will\nnot be constituted by just any demand sponsored by a system of social\nrelationships that one in fact values. Some such demands have no moral\nforce, and some social systems are downright evil.\u201d (ibid, 242)\nIf a good and loving God exists and has created all humans, then the\nsocial relation humans have to God has the right features to explain\nmoral obligations. For if moral obligations stem from God\u2019s\nrequirements, they will be objective, but they will also be\nmotivating, since a relation to God would clearly be a great good that\nhumans would have reason to value. Since a proper relation to God is\narguably more important than any other social relation, we can also\nunderstand why moral obligations trump other kinds of obligations. On\nthis view we can also explain why moral obligations have a\ntranscendent character, which is important because \u201ca genuinely\nmoral conception of obligation must have resources for moral criticism\nof social systems and their demands.\u201d (ibid, 242\u2013243)\n\nNotice that the DCT Adams defends in his later work is ontological\nrather than semantic: it is a claim that moral obligations are in fact\nidentical with divine commands, not a claim that \u201cmoral\nobligations\u201d has the same meaning as \u201cdivine\ncommands.\u201d On his account, applying the work of direct reference\ntheorists like Hilary Putnam and Saul Kripke to the arena of ethics,\nthe meaning of \u201cmoral obligation\u201d is fixed by the role\nthis concept plays in our language. That role includes such facts as\nthese: Moral obligations must be motivating and objective. They also\nmust provide a basis for critical evaluation of other types of\nobligations, and they must be such that someone who violates a moral\nobligation is appropriately subject to blame. Adams argues that it is\ndivine commands that best satisfy these desiderata. God\u2019s\nexistence thus provides the best explanation of moral obligations. If\nmoral obligations are identical with divine commands (or perhaps if\nthey are grounded in or caused to exist by divine commands) an\nargument for God\u2019s existence from such obligations can easily be\nconstructed:\n\nThere are objective\nmoral obligations.\nIf there are objective\nmoral obligations, there is a God who explains these obligations.\nThere is a God.\n\n\nThis argument is stated in a deductive form, but it can easily be\nreworded as a probabilistic \u201cargument to the best\nexplanation,\u201d as follows:\n\nThere are objective\nmoral obligations.\nGod provides the best\nexplanation of the existence of moral obligations.\nProbably, God\nexists.\n\n\nObviously, those who do not find a DCT convincing will not think this\nargument from moral obligation has force. However, Adams anticipates\nand gives a forceful answer to one common criticism of a DCT. It is\noften argued that a DCT must fail because of a dilemma parallel to one\nderived from Plato\u2019s Euthyphro. The dilemma\nfor a DCT can be derived from the following question: Assuming that\nGod commands what is right, does he command what is right because it\nis right (assuming that \u201cright\u201d here means \u201cmorally\nrequired\u201d and not just \u201cmorally permissible.\u201d)? If\nthe proponent of a DCT answers affirmatively, then it appears the\nquality of rightness must hold antecedently to and thus independently\nof God\u2019s commands. If, however, the proponent denies that God\ncommands what is right because it is right, then God\u2019s commands\nappear arbitrary. Adams\u2019 version of a DCT evades this dilemma by\ninvoking the good/right distinction and holding that God is\nessentially good and that his commands are necessarily aimed at the\ngood. This allows Adams to claim that God\u2019s commands make\nactions obligatory (or forbidden), while denying that the commands are\narbitrary in any problematic sense.\n\nAlthough Adams\u2019 version of a DCT successfully meets this\n\u201cEuthyphro\u201d objection, there are other\npowerful criticisms that have been mounted against this metaethical\ntheory in the literature. These objections can be found in the\nwritings of Wes Morriston (2009, 2016), Erik Wielenberg (2005,\nespecially part 3, 2014, and  chapter 2, 2020), Oppy (2014,\nespecially ch. 3), and Nicholas Wolterstorff (2007), among others.\nBesides arbitrariness, objections raised against DCT include autonomy\nobjections, a variety of epistemic objections, a psychopathy\nobjection, supervenience objections, prior obligations objection, and\nother Euthyphro objections, which include grounding, vacuity, and\ncounterpossible objections. \n\nWielenberg explicitly defends as an alternative to divine command\nmetaethics a view he calls \u201cgodless normative realism.\u201d\nThis is essentially the view that moral truths are basic or\nfundamental in character, not derived from natural facts or any more\nfundamental metaphysical facts. It thus seems similar to the view\noften called \u201cethical non-naturalism.\u201d This view certainly\nprovides a significant alternative to divine command metaethics.\nHowever, it is worth noting that some of the criticisms that\nmetaphysical naturalists have against theistic metaethics may apply to\nWielenberg\u2019s view as well. Specifically, philosophers such as J.\nL. Mackie (1977) find non-natural ethical qualities of any kind\n\u201cqueer\u201d since they are so unlike the realities discovered\nby science. The \u201cbrute moral facts\u201d posited by Wielenberg\nas necessary truths seem vulnerable to this same criticism. In fact,\nthe criticism may be sharper against Wielenberg\u2019s view than\nagainst theistic views, since ethical truths may appear less odd in a\nuniverse that is ultimately grounded in a person. Responses to the\nobjections of Wielenberg, Morriston, and others have also been given\n(see Evans 2013, Baggett and Walls, 2011, 2016, Flannagan, 2017,\n2021a, 2021, Pruss, 2009, Davis and Franks, 2015). Clearly the version\nof a moral argument for God\u2019s existence that rests on divine\ncommand theory will only be judged powerful by those who find a DCT\nplausible, and that will certainly be a minority of philosophers.\n(Although it is worth noting that no single metaethical theory seems\nto enjoy widespread support among philosophers, so a DCT is not alone\nin being a minority view.) Nevertheless, those who do find a DCT\npowerful will also see moral obligations as providing strong evidence\nfor God\u2019s reality.\n4. Arguments from Moral Knowledge or Awareness\n\nA variety of arguments have been developed that God is necessary to\nexplain human awareness of moral truth (or moral knowledge, if one\nbelieves that this moral awareness amounts to knowledge). Richard\nSwinburne (2004, 218), for example, argues that there is no\n\u201cgreat probability that moral awareness will occur in a Godless\nuniverse.\u201d On Swinburne\u2019s view, moral truths are either\nnecessary truths or contingent truths that are grounded in necessary\ntruths. For example, it is obviously contingent that \u201cIt is\nwrong to drop an atomic bomb on Hiroshima,\u201d since it is\ncontingent that there exists a city such as Hiroshima. But one might\nhold that this proposition is true (assuming it is) because of some\nother truth such as \u201cIt is wrong intentionally to kill innocent\nhumans\u201d which does hold universally and is necessarily true.\nSwinburne does not think that an argument to God\u2019s existence\nfrom moral facts as such is powerful, increasing the likelihood of\ntheism only a little. However, the fact that we humans are aware of\nmoral facts is itself surprising and calls for an explanation.\n\nIt may be true that creatures who belong to groups that behave\naltruistically will have some survival advantage over groups that lack\nsuch a trait. However, moral beliefs are not required in order to\nproduce such behavior, since it is clear that \u201cthere are many\nspecies of animals that are naturally inclined to help others of their\nspecies, and yet do not have moral beliefs.\u201d (Swinburne 2004,\n217) If God exists, he has \u201csignificant reason to bring about\nconscious beings with moral awareness,\u201d since his intended\npurpose for humans includes making it possible for them freely to\nchoose good over evil, since this will make it possible for them to\ndevelop a relation to God. Swinburne does not think that this argument\nprovides very strong evidence for God\u2019s existence by itself, but\nrather that it provides some inductive support for belief in God. It\nis one of several phenomena which seem more probable in a theistic\nuniverse than in a godless universe. As we consider more and more such\nphenomena, it will be increasingly improbable that \u201cthey\nwill all occur.\u201d (ibid, 218) All of these\ninductive arguments together may then provide substantial support for\ntheistic belief, even if no one of them by itself would be sufficient\nfor rational belief by demonstrating that theism is likely true.\n\nSwinburne\u2019s version of the argument is quite brief and\nundeveloped, but some claims that could be used to support a more\ndeveloped version of the argument (one that will be described below)\ncan be found in a well-known and much cited article by Sharon Street\n(2006). Street\u2019s argument, as the title implies, is in no way\nintended to support a moral argument for theism. To the contrary, her\npurpose is to defend anti-realist metaethical theories against realist\ntheories that view moral truth as \u201cstance-independent\u201d of\nhuman attitudes and emotions. Street presents the moral realist with a\ndilemma posed by the question as to how our human evaluative beliefs\nare related to human evolution. It is clear, she believes, that\nevolution has strongly shaped our evaluative attitudes. The question\nconcerns how those attitudes are related to the objective evaluative\ntruths accepted by the realist. If the realist holds that there is no\nrelation between such truths and our evaluative attitudes, then this\nimplies that \u201cmost of our evaluative judgments are off track due\nto the distorting influence of Darwinian processes.\u201d The other\nalternative for the realist is to claim that there is a relationship,\nand thus that is not an accident or miracle that our evaluative\nbeliefs track the objective truths. However, this view, Street claims,\nis scientifically implausible. Street argues therefore that an\nevolutionary story about how we came to make the moral judgments we\nmake undermines confidence in the objective truth of those judgments.\nStreet\u2019s argument is of course controversial and thinkers such\nas Erik Wielenberg (2014) have argued against evolutionary debunking\narguments. Still, many regard such arguments as problematic for those\nwho want to defend moral realism, particularly when developed as a\n\u201cglobal\u201d argument (Kahane, 2010).\n\nStreet\u2019s argument has also been challenged by such critics as\nRuss Shafer-Landau (2012). However, her argument, and similar\narguments, have been acknowledged by some moral realists, such as\nDavid Enoch (2011) and Erik Wielenberg (2014) to pose a significant\nproblem for their view. Enoch, for example, even though he offers a\nresponse to Street\u2019s argument, evidently has some worries about\nthe strength of his reply. Wielenberg, to avoid the criticism that in\na non-theistic universe it would be extremely lucky if evolution\nselected for belief in objectively true moral values, proposes that\nthe natural laws that produce this result may be metaphysically\nnecessary, and thus there is no element of luck. However, many\nphilosophers will see this view of natural laws as paying a heavy\nprice to avoid theism. It might appear that Street is arguing\nstraightforwardly that evolutionary theory makes it improbable that\nhumans would have objective moral knowledge. However, it is not\nevolution by itself that predicts the improbability of objective moral\nknowledge, but the conjunction of evolution and metaphysical\nnaturalism. A good deal of the force of Street\u2019s argument stems\nfrom the assumption that naturalism is true, and therefore that the\nevolutionary process is one that is unguided. Since it is not\nevolution by itself that poses a challenge to moral realism but the\nconjunction of evolution and metaphysical naturalism, then rejecting\nnaturalism provides one way for the moral realist to solve the\nproblem. It does appear that in a naturalistic universe we would\nexpect a process of Darwinian evolution to select for a propensity for\nmoral judgments that track survival and not objective moral truths.\nMark Linville (2009, 391\u2013446) has developed a detailed argument\nfor the claim that it is difficult for metaphysical naturalists to\ndevelop a plausible evolutionary story as to how our moral judgments\ncould have epistemological warrant. However, if we suppose that the\nevolutionary process has been guided by God, who has as one of his\ngoals the creation of morally significant human creatures capable of\nenjoying a relation with God, then it would not seem at all accidental\nor even unlikely that God would ensure that humans have value beliefs\nthat are largely correct.\n\nSome philosophers believe that the randomness of Darwinian natural\nselection rules out the possibility of any kind of divine guidance\nbeing exercised through such a process. Some thinkers, including both\nsome atheists and some proponents of what is called \u201ccreation\nscience,\u201d believe that evolution and God are rivals, mutually\nexclusive hypotheses about the origins of the natural world. What can\nbe explained scientifically needs no religious explanation. However,\nthis is far from obviously true; in fact, if theism is true it is\nclearly false. From a theistic perspective to think that God and\nscience provide competing explanations fails to grasp the relationship\nbetween God and the natural world by conceiving of God as one more\ncause within that natural world. If God exists at all, God is not an\nentity within the natural world, but the creator of that natural\nworld, with all of its causal processes. If God exists, God is the\nreason why there is a natural world and the reason for the existence\nof the causal processes of the natural world. In principle, therefore,\na natural explanation can never preclude a theistic explanation. \nAny argument that natural explanations preclude or are in tension with\ntheistic explanations will in fact be theological in character, since\nthey will be grounded in assumptions about the kind of world God would\ncreate.\n\nBut what about the randomness that is a crucial part of the Darwinian\nstory? The atheist might claim that because evolutionary theory posits\nthat the process by which plants and animals have evolved is one that\ninvolves random genetic mutations, it cannot be guided, and thus God\ncannot have used evolutionary means to achieve his ends. However, this\nargument fails. It depends on an equivocation in what is meant by\n\u201crandom.\u201d When scientists claim that genetic mutations are\nrandom, they do not mean that they are uncaused, or even that they are\nunpredictable from the point of view of biochemistry, but only that\nthe mutations do not happen in response to the adaptational needs of\nthe organism. It is entirely possible for a natural process to include\nrandomness in that sense, even if the whole natural order is itself\ncreated and sustained by God. The sense of \u201crandomness\u201d\nrequired for evolutionary theory does not imply that the evolutionary\nprocess must be unguided. A God who is responsible for the laws of\nnature and the initial conditions that shape the evolutionary process\ncould certainly ensure that the process achieved certain ends.\n\nLike the other moral arguments for God\u2019s existence, the argument\nfrom moral knowledge can easily be stated in a propositional form, and\nI believe Swinburne is right to hold that the argument is best\nconstrued as a probabilistic argument that appeals to God as providing\na better explanation of moral knowledge than is possible in a\nnaturalistic universe.\n\nHumans possess\nobjective moral knowledge.\nProbably, if God does\nnot exist, humans would not possess objective moral knowledge.\nProbably, God\nexists.\n\n\nThere is a kind of argument from moral knowledge also implicit in\nAngus Ritchie\u2019s  book From Morality to\nMetaphysics: The Theistic Implications of our Ethical\nCommitments (2012). Ritchie presses a kind of\ndilemma on non-theistic accounts of morality. Subjectivist theories\nsuch as expressivism can certainly make sense of the fact that we make\nthe ethical judgments we do, but they empty morality of its objective\nauthority. Objectivist theories that take morality seriously, however,\nhave difficulty explaining our capacity to make true moral judgments,\nunless the process by which humans came to hold these capacities is\none that is controlled by a being such as God.\n\nThe moral argument from knowledge will not be convincing to anyone who\nis committed to any form of expressivism or other non-objective\nmetaethical theory, and clearly many philosophers find such views\nattractive. And there will surely be many philosophers who will judge\nthat if moral objectivism implies theism or requires theism to be\nplausible, this is a reductio of objectivist views.\nFurthermore, non-theistic moral philosophers, whether naturalists or\nnon-naturalists, have stories to tell about how moral knowledge might\nbe possible. Nevertheless, there are real questions about the\nplausibility of these stories, and thus, some of those convinced that\nmoral realism is true may judge that moral knowledge provides some\nsupport for theistic belief.\n5. Arguments from Human Dignity or Worth\n\nMany philosophers find Immanuel Kant\u2019s moral philosophy still\noffers a fruitful approach to ethics. Of the various forms of the\n\u201ccategorical imperative\u201d that Kant offers, the formula\nthat regards human beings as \u201cends in themselves\u201d is\nespecially attractive: \u201cAct in such a way that you always treat\nhumanity, whether in your own person or in the person of any other,\nnever simply as a means, but always at the same time as an end\u201d\n(Kant 1785 [1964], 96). Many contemporary moral philosophers\ninfluenced by Kant, such as Christine Korsgaard (1996), see Kant as\noffering a \u201cconstructivist\u201d metaethical position.\nConstructivism is supposed to offer a \u201cthird way\u201d between\nmoral realism and subjectivist views of morality. Like subjectivists,\nconstructivists want to see morality as a human creation. However,\nlike moral realists constructivists want to see moral questions as\nhaving objective answers. Constructivism is an attempt to develop an\nobjective morality that is free of the metaphysical commitments of\nmoral realism.\n\nIt is, however, controversial whether Kant himself was a\nconstructivist in this sense. One reason to question whether this is\nthe right way to read Kant follows from the fact that Kant himself did\nnot see morality as free from metaphysical commitments. For example,\nKant thought that it would be impossible for someone who believed that\nmechanistic determinism was the literal truth about himself to believe\nthat he was a moral agent, since morality requires an autonomy that is\nincompatible with determinism. To see myself as a creature who has the\nkind of value Kant calls \u201cdignity\u201d I must not see myself\nmerely as a machine-like product of the physical environment. Hence\nKant thought that it was crucial for morality that his Critical\nPhilosophy had shown that the deterministic perspective on humans is\nsimply part of the \u201cphenomenal world\u201d that is the object\nof scientific knowledge, not the \u201cnoumenal reality\u201d that\nit would be if some kind of scientific realism were the true\nmetaphysical view. When we do science we see ourselves as determined,\nbut science tells us only how the world appears, not how it really is.\nRecognizing this fact suggests that when Kant posits that humans have\nthis intrinsic value he calls dignity, he is not\n\u201cconstructing\u201d the value humans have, but recognizing the\nvalue beings of a certain kind must have. Humans can only have this\nkind of value if they are a particular kind of creature. Whether Kant\nhimself was a moral realist or not, there are certainly elements in\nhis philosophy that push in a realist direction.\n\nIf the claim that human persons have a kind of intrinsic dignity or\nworth is a true objective principle and if it provides a key\nfoundational principle of morality, it is well worth asking what kinds\nof metaphysical implications the claim might have. This is the\nquestion that Mark Linville (2009, 417\u2013446) pursues in the\nsecond moral argument he develops. Linville begins by noting that one\ncould hardly hold that \u201chuman persons have intrinsic\ndignity\u201d could be true if human persons do not exist. Clearly,\nsome metaphysical positions do include a denial of the existence of\nhuman persons, such as forms of Absolute Monism which hold that only\none Absolute Reality exists. However, it also seems to be the case\nthat some forms of Scientific Naturalism are committed to the denial\nof \u201cpersons as substantive selves that essentially\npossess a first-person point of view\u201d (See Dennett 2006, 107).\nDaniel Dennett, for example, holds that persons will not be part of\nthe ultimately true scientific account of things. Dennett holds that\nto think of humans as persons is simply to adopt a certain\n\u201cstance\u201d toward them that he calls the \u201cintentional\nstance,\u201d but it is clear that the kind of picture of humans we\nget when we think of them in this way does not correspond with their\nintrinsic metaphysical properties. It is not clear how systems towards\nwhich we adopt an \u201cintentional stance\u201d could be truly\nautonomous and thus have the kind of value Kant believes human persons\nhave.\n\nThe argument from human dignity could be put into propositional form\nas follows:\n\nHuman persons have a\nspecial kind of intrinsic value that we call dignity.\nThe only (or best)\nexplanation of the fact that humans possess dignity is that they are\ncreated by a supremely good God in God\u2019s own image.\nProbably there is a\nsupremely good God.\n\n\nA naturalist may want to challenge premise (2) by finding some other\nstrategy to explain human dignity. Michael Martin (2002), for example,\nhas tried to suggest that moral judgments can be analyzed as the\nfeelings of approval or disapproval of a perfectly impartial and\ninformed observer. Linville (2009) objects that it is not clear how\nthe feelings of such an observer could constitute the intrinsic worth\nof a person, since one would think that intrinsic properties would be\nnon-relational and mind-independent. In any case, Linville notes that\na \u201cEuthyphro\u201d problem lurks for such an ideal observer\ntheory, since one would think that such an observer would judge a\nperson to be intrinsically valuable because the person has intrinsic\nvalue.\n\nAnother strategy that is pursued by constructivists such as Korsgaard\nis to link the value ascribed to humans to the capacity for rational\nreflection. The idea is that insofar as I am committed to rational\nreflection, I must value myself as having this capacity, and\nconsistently value others who have it as well. A similar strategy is\nfound in Wielenberg\u2019s form of ethical non-naturalism, since\nWielenberg argues that it is necessarily true that any being with\ncertain reflective capacities will have moral rights (Wielenberg,\n2014, chapter 4). It is far from clear that human rationality provides\nan adequate ground for moral rights, however. Many people believe that\nyoung infants and people suffering from dementia still have this\nintrinsic dignity, but in both cases there is no capacity for rational\nreflection.\n\nSome support for this criticism of the attempt to see reason as the\nbasis of the value of humans can be found in Nicholas\nWolterstorff\u2019s recent work on justice (2007, especially Ch. 8).\nWolterstorff in this work defends the claim that there are natural\nhuman rights, and that violating such rights is one way of acting\nunjustly towards a person. Why do humans have such rights?\nWolterstorff says these rights are grounded in the basic worth or\ndignity that humans possess. When I seek to torture or kill an\ninnocent human I am failing to respect this worth. If one asks why we\nshould think humans possess such worth, Wolterstorff argues that the\nbelief that humans have this quality was not only historically\nproduced by Jewish and Christian conceptions of the human person, but\neven now cannot be defended apart from such a conception. In\nparticular, he argues that attempts to argue that our worth stems from\nsome excellence we possess such as reason will not explain the worth\nof infants or those with severe brain injuries or dementia.\n\nDoes a theistic worldview fare better in explaining the special value\nof human dignity? In a theistic universe God is himself seen as the\nsupreme good. Indeed, theistic Platonists usually identify God with\nthe Good. If God is himself a person, then this seems to be a\ncommitment to the idea that personhood itself is something that must\nbe intrinsically good. If human persons are made in God\u2019s image,\nas both Judaism and Christianity affirm, then it would seem to follow\nthat humans do have a kind of intrinsic value, just by way of being\nthe kind of creatures they are.\n\nThis argument will of course be found unconvincing to many. Some will\ndeny premise (1), either because they reject moral realism as a\nmetaethical stance, or because they reject the normative claim that\nhumans have any kind of special value or dignity. (Maybe they will\neven think that such a claim is a form of \u201cspeciesism.\u201d).\nOthers will find premise (2) suspect. They may be inclined to agree\nthat human persons have a special dignity, but hold that the source of\nthat dignity can be found in such human qualities as rationality. With\nrespect to the status of infants and those suffering from dementia,\nthe critic might bite the bullet and just accept the fact that human\ndignity does not extend to them, or else argue that the fact that\ninfants and those suffering mental breakdown are part of a species\nwhose members typically possess rationality merits them a special\nrespect, even if they lack this quality as individuals. Others will\nfind premise (2) doubtful because they find the theistic explanation\nof dignity unclear. Another alternative is to seek a Constructivist\naccount of dignity, perhaps regarding the special status of humans as\nsomething we humans decide to extend to each other. Perhaps the\nstrongest non-theistic alternative would be some form of ethical\nnon-naturalism, in which one simply affirms that the claim that\npersons have a special dignity is an a priori truth\nrequiring no explanation. In effect this is a decision for a\nnon-theistic form of Platonism.\n\nThe proponent of the argument may well agree that claims about the\nspecial status of humans are true a priori, and\nthus also opt for some form of Platonism. However, the proponent of\nthe argument will point out that some necessary truths can be\nexplained by other necessary truths. The theist believes that these\ntruths about the special status of humans tell us something about the\nkind of universe humans find themselves in. To say that humans are\ncreated by God is to say that personhood is not an ephemeral or\naccidental feature of the universe, because at bottom reality itself\nis personal (Mavrodes 1986).\n6. Practical Moral Arguments for Belief in God\n\nAs already noted, the most famous and perhaps most influential version\nof a moral argument for belief in God is found in Immanuel Kant\n(1788). Kant himself insisted that his argument was not a theoretical\nargument, but an argument grounded in practical reason. The conclusion\nof the argument is not \u201cGod exists\u201d or \u201cGod probably\nexists\u201d but \u201cI (as a rational, moral agent) ought to\nbelieve that God exists.\u201d We shall, however, see that there are\nsome reasons to doubt that practical arguments can be neatly separated\nfrom theoretical arguments.\n\nKant\u2019s version of the argument can be stated in different ways,\nbut perhaps the following captures one plausible interpretation of the\nargument. Morality is grounded in pure practical reason, and the moral\nagent must act on the basis of maxims that can be rationally endorsed\nas universal principles. Moral actions are thus not determined by\nresults or consequences but by the maxims on which they are based.\nHowever, all actions, including moral actions, necessarily aim at\nends. Kant argues that the end that moral actions aim at is the\n\u201chighest good,\u201d which is a world in which both moral\nvirtue and happiness are maximized, with happiness contingent on\nvirtue. For Kant \u201cought implies can,\u201d and so if I have an\nobligation to seek the highest good, then I must believe that it is\npossible to achieve such an end. However, I must seek the highest good\nonly by acting in accordance with morality; no shortcuts to happiness\nare permissible. This seems to require that I believe that acting in\naccordance with morality will be causally efficacious in achieving the\nhighest good. However, it is reasonable to believe that moral actions\nwill be causally efficacious in this way only if the laws of causality\nare set up in such a way that these laws are conducive to the efficacy\nof moral action. Certainly both parts of the highest good seem\ndifficult to achieve. We humans have weaknesses in our character that\nappear difficult if not impossible to overcome by our own efforts.\nFurthermore, as creatures we have subjective needs that must be\nsatisfied if we are happy, but we have little empirical reason to\nthink that these needs will be satisfied by moral actions even if we\nsucceeded in becoming virtuous. If a person believes that the natural\nworld is simply a non-moral machine with no moral purposiveness then\nthat person would have no reason to believe that moral action could\nsucceed because there is no a priori reason to\nthink moral action will achieve the highest good and little empirical\nreason to believe this either. Kant thus concludes that a moral agent\nmust \u201cpostulate\u201d the existence of God as a rational\npresupposition of the moral life.\n\nOne problem with this argument is that many will deny that morality\nrequires us to seek the highest good in Kant\u2019s sense. Even if\nthe Kantian highest good seems reasonable as an ideal, some will\nobject that we have no obligation to achieve such a state, but merely\nto work towards realizing the closest approximation to such a state\nthat is possible (See Adams 1987, 152). Without divine assistance,\nperhaps perfect virtue is unachievable, but in that case we cannot be\nobliged to realize such a state if there is no God. Perhaps we cannot\nhope that happiness will be properly proportioned to virtue in the\nactual world if God does not exist, but then our obligation can only\nbe to realize as much happiness as can be attained through moral\nmeans. Kant would doubtless reject this criticism, since on his view\nthe ends of morality are given directly to pure practical\nreason a priori, and we are not at liberty to\nadjust those ends on the basis of empirical beliefs. However, few\ncontemporary philosophers would share Kant\u2019s confident view of\nreason here, and thus to many the criticism has force. Even Kant\nadmits at one point that full-fledged belief in God is not rationally\nnecessary, since one could conceivably seek the highest good if one\nmerely believes that God\u2019s existence is possible (Kant,\n1781\u20131787, 651).\n\nAnother way of interpreting Kant\u2019s argument puts more stress on\nthe connection between an individual\u2019s desire for happiness and\nthe obligation to do what is morally right. Morality requires me to\nsacrifice my personal happiness if that is necessary to do what is\nright. Yet it is a psychological fact that humans necessarily desire\ntheir own happiness. In such a state it looks as if human moral agents\nwill be torn by what Henry Sidgwick called the \u201cdualism of the\npractical reason\u201d (1884, 401). Reason both requires humans to\nseek their own happiness and to sacrifice it. Sidgwick himself noted\nthat only if there is a God can we hope that this dualism will be\nresolved, so that those who seek to act morally will in the long run\nalso be acting so as to advance their own happiness and well-being.\n(Interestingly, Sidgwick himself does not endorse this argument, but\nhe clearly sees this problem as part of the appeal of theism.) A\ncontemporary argument similar to this one has been developed by C.\nStephen Layman (2002).\n\nThe critic of this form of the Kantian argument may reply that Kantian\nmorality sees duty as something that must be done regardless of the\nconsequences, and thus a truly moral person cannot make his or her\ncommitment to morality contingent on the achievement of happiness.\nFrom a Kantian point of view, this reply seems right; Kant\nunequivocally affirms that moral actions must be done for the sake of\nduty and not from any desire for personal reward. Nevertheless,\nespecially for any philosopher willing to endorse any form of\neudaimonism, seeing myself as inevitably sacrificing what I cannot\nhelp but desire for the sake of duty does seem problematic. As John\nHare affirms, \u201cIf we are to endorse wholeheartedly the long-term\nshape of our lives, we have to see this shape as consistent with our\nhappiness\u201d (1996, 88).\n\nThe critic may reply to this by simply accepting the lamentable fact\nthat there is something tragic or even absurd about the human\ncondition. The world may not be the world we wish it was, but that\ndoes not give us any reason to believe it is different from what it\nis. If there is a tension between the demands of morality and\nself-interest, then this may simply be a brute fact that must be\nfaced.\n\nThis reply raises an issue for all forms of practical or pragmatic\narguments for belief. Many philosophers insist that rational belief\nmust be grounded solely in theoretical evidence. The fact that it\nwould be better for me to believe p does not in itself give me any\nreason to believe p. This criticism is aimed not merely at Kant, but\nat other practical moral arguments. For example, Robert Adams argues\nthat if humans believe there is no moral order to the universe, then\nthey will become demoralized in their pursuit of morality, which is\nmorally undesirable (1987, 151). The atheist might concede that\natheism is (somewhat) demoralizing, but deny that this provides any\nreason to believe there is a moral order to the universe. Similarly,\nLinda Zagzebski (1987) argues that morality will not be a rational\nenterprise unless good actions increase the amount of good in the\nworld. However, given that moral actions often involve the sacrifice\nof happiness, there is no reason to believe moral action will increase\nthe good unless there is a power transcendent of human activity\nworking on the side of the good. Here the atheist may claim that moral\naction does increase the good because such actions always increase\ngood character. However, even if that reply fails the atheist may\nagain simply admit that there may be something tragic or absurd about\nthe human condition, and the fact that we may wish things were\ndifferent is not a reason to believe that they are. So the problem\nmust be faced: Are practical arguments merely rationalized\nwish-fulfillment?\n\nThe theist might respond to this kind of worry in several ways. The\nfirst thing to be said is that the fact that a naturalistic view of\nthe universe implies that the universe must be tragic or absurd, if\ncorrect, would itself be an important and interesting conclusion.\nHowever, apart from this, it makes a great deal of difference how one\nconstrues what we might call the background epistemic situation. If\none believes that our theoretical evidence favors atheism, then it\nseems plausible to hold that one ought to maintain a naturalistic\nview, even if it is practically undesirable that the world have such a\ncharacter. In that case a practical argument for religious belief\ncould be judged a form of wish-fulfillment. However, this does not\nseem to be the way those who support such a practical argument see the\nsituation. Kant affirms that the limits of reason established\nin The Critique of Pure Reason would silence all\nobjections to morality and religion \u201cin Socratic fashion,\nnamely, by the clearest proof of the ignorance of the\nobjectors.\u201d (1781, 1787, 30. See also 530\u2013531) In fact,\nthe situation actually favors theism, since Kant holds that\ntheoretical reason sees value in the concept of God as a regulative\nideal, even though God\u2019s existence cannot be theoretically\naffirmed as knowledge. If we appeal to God\u2019s will to explain\nwhat happens in the natural order, we undermine both science and\nreligion, since in that case we would no longer seek empirical\nevidence for causality and we would make God into a finite object in\nthe natural world (1781, 1787, 562\u2013563). However, as a\nregulative ideal, the concept of God is one that theoretical reason\nfinds useful: \u201cThe assumption of a supreme intelligence, as the\none and only cause of the universe, though in the idea alone, can\ntherefore always benefit reason and can never injure it\u201d (1781,\n1787, 560). There is a sense in which theoretical reason itself\ninclines towards affirmation of God, because it must assume that\nreality is rationally knowable: \u201cIf one wishes to achieve\nsystematic knowledge of the world, he ought to regard it as if it were\ncreated by a supreme reason.\u201d (Kant 1786, 298) Although\ntheoretical reason cannot affirm the existence of God, it finds it\nuseful to think of the natural world as having the kinds of\ncharacteristics it would have if God did exist. Thus, if rational\ngrounds for belief in God come from practical reason, theoretical\nreason will raise no objections.\n\nFor Kant the argument from practical reason for belief in God is not a\nform of wish-fulfillment because its ground is not an arbitrary desire\nor wish but \u201ca real need associated with reason\u201d (Kant,\n1786, 296). Human beings are not purely theoretical spectators of the\nuniverse, but agents. It is not always rational or even possible to\nrefrain from action, and yet action presupposes beliefs about the way\nthings are (For a good interpretation and defense of this view of Kant\non the relation between action and belief, see Wood 1970,\n17\u201325). Thus, in some cases suspension of judgment is not\npossible. The critic may object that a person may act as if p were\ntrue without believing p. However, it is not clear that this advice to\ndistinguish action on the basis of p and belief that p can always be\nfollowed. For one thing, it seems empirically the case that one way of\nacquiring belief that p is simply to begin to act as if p were true.\nHence, to begin to act as if p were true is at least to embark upon a\ncourse of action that makes belief in p more likely. Second, there may\nwell be a sense of \u201cbelief\u201d in which \u201cacting as if p\nwere true\u201d is sufficient to constitute belief. This is obviously\nthe case on pragmatist accounts of belief. But even those who reject a\ngeneral pragmatic account of belief may well find something like this\nappealing with respect to religious belief. Many religious believers\nhold that the best way to measure a person\u2019s religious faith is\nin terms of the person\u2019s actions. Thus, a person who is willing\nto act on the basis of a religious conception, especially if those\nactions are risky or costly, is truly a religious believer, even if\nthat person is filled with doubt and anxiety. Such a person might well\nbe construed as more truly a believer than a person who smugly\n\u201cassents\u201d to religious doctrines but is unwilling to act\non them.\n\nPerhaps the right way to think of practical moral arguments is not to\nsee them as justifying belief without evidence, but as shifting the\namount of evidence seen as necessary. This is the lesson some would\ndraw from the phenomenon of \u201cpragmatic encroachment\u201d that\nhas been much discussed in recent epistemology. Here is an example of\npragmatic encroachment:\n\nYou: I am about to replace the ceiling fan in the kitchen.\n\nSpouse: Did you turn off the main electrical power to the house?\n\nYou: Yes.\n\nSpouse: If you forgot you could electrocute yourself.\n\nYou: I better go back and check.\n\n(See McBrayer 2014, Rizzieri 2013).\n\n\nA plausible interpretation of this scenario is that ordinarily claims\nsuch as the one I made, based on memory, are justified, and count as\nknowledge. However, in this situation, the stakes are raised because\nmy life is at risk, and my knowledge is lost because the pragmatic\nsituation has \u201cencroached\u201d on the normal truth-oriented\nconditions for knowledge. Pragmatic encroachment is controversial and\nthe idea of such encroachment is rejected by some epistemologists.\nHowever, defenders hold that it is reasonable to consider the\npragmatic stakes in considering evidence for a belief that underlies\nsignificant action (see Fantl and McGrath 2007). If this is correct,\nthen it seems reasonable to consider the pragmatic situation in\ndetermining how much evidence is sufficient to justify religious\nbeliefs. In theory the adjustment could go in either direction,\ndepending on what costs are associated with a mistake and on which\nside those costs lie.\n\nIn any case it is not clear that practical moral arguments can always\nbe clearly distinguished from theoretical moral arguments. The reason\nthis is so is that in many cases the practical situation described\nseems itself to be or involve a kind of evidence for the truth of the\nbelief being justified. Take, for example, Kant\u2019s classic\nargument. One thing Kant\u2019s argument does is call to our\nattention that it would be enormously odd to believe that human beings\nare moral creatures subject to an objective moral law, but also to\nbelieve that the universe that humans inhabit is indifferent to\nmorality. In other words, the existence of human persons understood as\nmoral beings can itself be understood as a piece of evidence about the\ncharacter of the universe humans find themselves in. Peter Byrne\n(2013, 1998) has criticized practical arguments on the grounds that\nthey presuppose something like the following proposition: \u201cThe\nworld is likely to be organized so as to meet our deepest human\nneeds.\u201d Byrne objects that this premise is likely to be false if\nthere is no God and thus arguments that assume it appear circular.\nHowever, it is not clear that only those who already believe in God\nwill find this premise attractive. The reason for this is that humans\nare themselves part of the natural universe, and it seems a desirable\nfeature of a metaphysical view that it explain (rather than explain\naway) features of human existence that seem real and important.\n\nIt seems likely therefore that any appeal to a practical argument will\ninclude some theoretical component as well, even if that component is\nnot always made explicit. Nevertheless, this does not mean that\npractical arguments do not have some important and distinctive\nfeatures. For Kant it was important that religious beliefs stem from\npractical reason. For if religious belief were grounded solely in\ntheoretical reason, then such belief would have to conform to\n\u201cextrinsic and arbitrary legislation.\u201d (Kant 1790, 131)\nKant thinks such a religion would be one grounded in \u201cfear and\nsubmission,\u201d and thus it is good that religious belief is\nmotivated mainly by a free moral act by which the \u201cfinal end of\nour being\u201d is presented to us. (1790, 159) For any practical\nargument makes religious belief existential; the issue is not merely\nwhat I believe to be true about the universe but how I shall live my\nlife in that universe.\n7. Conclusion\n\nIt seems clear that no version of the moral argument constitutes a\n\u201cproof\u201d of God\u2019s existence. Each version contains\npremises that many reasonable thinkers reject. However, this does not\nmean the arguments have no force. One might think of each version of\nthe argument as attempting to spell out the \u201ccost\u201d of\nrejecting the conclusion. Some philosophers will certainly be willing\nto pay the cost, and indeed have independent reasons for doing so.\nHowever, it would certainly be interesting and important if one became\nconvinced that atheism required one to reject moral realism\naltogether, or to embrace an implausible account of how moral\nknowledge is acquired. For those who think that some version or\nversions of the arguments have force, the cumulative case for theistic\nbelief may be raised by such arguments.\n",
