    "main_text": "Law || Law needs to be coercive\n7.5 Unjust law and just revolution\n\nIf the law purports to require actions that no-one should ever do, it\ncannot rightly be complied with; one\u2019s moral obligation is not\nto obey but to disobey: ST I-II q. 96 a. 4. And if it\npurports to authorize such acts (e.g. rape, theft, or infanticide),\nits authorization is morally void and of no effect (II-II q. 57 a. 2\nad 2); courts should not guide their adjudications by such laws (II-II\nq. 60 a. 5 ad 1). But law\u2019s obligatoriness and authority is\nsubject to further conditions, derived from the very nature and\nrationale of political authority. If the law-makers (i) are motivated\nnot by concern for the community\u2019s common good but by greed or\nvanity (private motivations that make them tyrants, whatever the\ncontent of their legislation), or (ii) act outside the authority\ngranted to them, or (iii) while acting with a view to the common good\napportion the necessary burdens unfairly, their laws are unjust and in\nthe forum of reasonable conscience are not so much laws as acts of\nviolence [magis sunt violentiae quam leges]: I-II q. 96 a. 4.\nSuch laws lack moral authority, i.e. do not bind in conscience; one is\nneither morally obliged to conform nor morally obliged not to\nconform.\n\nThis conclusion is subject to a proviso or exception: laws which are\nunjust by reason of one or more of these three enumerated types of\ndefect in authority sometimes create an obligation in conscience just\nto the extent that disobedience would cause disorder or give the kind\nof \u2018example\u2019 that leads others into wrongdoing. To avoid\nthose sorts of unjust harm to public and private good one may have a\nmoral obligation to forgo one\u2019s right(s) [iuri suo debet\ncedere]. This obligation is not: to comply with the law according\nto its makers\u2019 intent, and/or to the meaning it has under the\nparticular legal system\u2019s interpretative canons. Rather, it is a\nkind of collateral obligation: to avoid those acts of non-compliance\nthat would unjustly risk having the bad side-effects of being seen not\nto comply.\n\nAll who govern in the interests of themselves rather than of the\ncommon good are tyrants, for that is what a tyrant is in the classical\nline of thought followed by Aquinas. Tyranny entails treating\none\u2019s subjects as slaves \u2013 persons used for the benefit of\nthe master. The laws of tyrants are not laws simpliciter, but\nrather a kind of perversion of law [perversitas legis], and\none is, in principle, entitled to treat them as one treats a\nbandit\u2019s demands: I-II q. 92 a 1 ad 4 & 5; II-II q. 69 a. 4.\nAgainst the regime\u2019s efforts to enforce its decrees one has the\nright of forcible resistance; as a private right this could extend as\nfar as killing the tyrant as a foreseen side-effect of one\u2019s\nlegitimate self-defence. It is the tyrant rather than the subject who\nis morally guilty of sedition. If one can associate with others to\nconstitute oneself with them a kind of public authority willing and\nable to assume responsibility for the common good of the state, one is\nentitled, in Aquinas\u2019 view, to set about overthrowing, and if\nneed be executing, the tyrant, with a view to the liberatio\nof the people [multitudinis] and the homeland\n[patriae]. Since rulers who are not tyrants are entitled to\nhunt down and most severely punish sedition, and both rulers and\nsubjects may fall into error about each other\u2019s moral status,\nsubjects ought to be slow to judge a tyranny so unjust that\noverthrowing or forcibly resisting it is fair to those likely to be\ninjured as a side-effect of revolutionary struggle; there is a\n(defeasible) presumption in favor of acquiescence and merely passive\ndisobedience: II-II q. 42 a. 2 ad 3, q. 104 a. 6 ad 3; II\nSent. d. 44 q. 2 a. 2; Reg. 1.6.\n",
