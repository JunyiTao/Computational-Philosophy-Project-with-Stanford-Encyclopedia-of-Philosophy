    "main_text": "Inexactness, ceteris paribus clauses, tendencies, \u201cunrealistic assumptions\u201d and models || Classical economics and the method a priori\n3.1 Classical economics and the method a priori\n\nThe first extended reflections on economic methodology appear in the\nwork of Nassau Senior (1836) and John Stuart Mill (1836). Their essays\nmust be understood against the background of both the economic theory\nand the philosophy of science of their times. Like Smith\u2019s\neconomics (to which it owed a great deal) and modern economics, the\n\u201cclassical\u201d economics of the middle decades of the 19th\ncentury traced economic regularities to the choices of individuals\nfacing social and natural constraints. But, as compared to Smith, more\nreliance was placed on severely simplified models. David\nRicardo\u2019s Principles of Political Economy (1817), draws\na portrait in which wages above the subsistence level lead to\nincreases in the population, which in turn require more intensive\nagriculture or cultivation of inferior land. The extension of\ncultivation leads to lower profits and higher rents; and the whole\ntale of economic development leads to a gloomy stationary state in\nwhich profits are too low to command any net investment, wages slide\nback to subsistence levels, and only the landlords are affluent.\n\nFortunately for the world, but unfortunately for economic theorists of\nthe mid 19th century, the data consistently contradicted the trends\nthe theory predicted (de Marchi 1970). Yet the theory continued to\nhold sway for more than half a century, and the consistently\nunfavorable data were explained away as due to various\n\u201cdisturbing causes.\u201d It is consequently not surprising\nthat Senior\u2019s and Mill\u2019s accounts of the method of\neconomics emphasize the relative autonomy of theory.\n\nMill distinguishes between two main kinds of inductive methods. The\nmethod a posteriori is a method of direct experience. In his\nview, it is only suitable for phenomena in which few causal factors\nare operating or in which experimental controls are possible.\nMill\u2019s famous methods of induction provide an articulation of\nthe method a posteriori. In his method of difference, for\nexample, one holds fixed every causal factor except one and checks to\nsee whether the effect ceases to obtain when that one factor is\nremoved. The goal is to identify exceptionless causal laws.\n\nMill maintains that direct inductive methods cannot be used to study\nphenomena in which many causal factors are in play. If, for example,\none attempts to investigate whether tariffs enhance or impede\nprosperity by comparing the prosperity of nations with high tariffs\nand nations without high tariffs, the results will be uninformative,\nbecause prosperity depends on so many other causal factors. So, Mill\nargues, one needs instead to employ the method a priori.\nDespite its name, this too is an inductive method. However, unlike the\nmethod a posteriori, the method a priori is an\nindirect inductive method. Scientists first determine the\nlaws governing individual causal factors in domains in which\nMill\u2019s methods of induction are applicable. Having then\ndetermined the laws of the individual causes, they investigate their\ncombined consequences deductively. Finally, there is a role for\n\u201cverification\u201d of the combined consequences, but owing to\nthe causal complications, this testing has comparatively little\nweight. The testing of the conclusions serves only as a check on the\nscientist\u2019s deductions and as an indicator of whether there are\nsignificant disturbing causes that scientists have not yet accounted\nfor.\n\nMill gives the example of the science of the tides. Physicists\ndetermined the law of gravitation by studying planetary motion, in\nwhich gravity is the only significant causal factor. Then physicists\ndevelop the theory of tides deductively from that law and information\nconcerning the positions and motions of the moon and sun. The\nimplications of the theory will be inexact and sometimes badly\nmistaken, because many subsidiary causal factors influence tides.\nTesting theories of tides can uncover mistakes in the deductions\nphysicists made, and it may uncover evidence concerning the role of the\nsubsidiary factors. But because of the causal complexity, such testing\ndoes little to confirm or disconfirm the law of gravitation, which has\nalready been established. Although Mill does not often use the\nlanguage of \u201cceteris paribus\u201d, his view that the\nprinciples or \u201claws\u201d of economics hold in the absence of\n\u201cinterferences\u201d or \u201cdisturbing causes\u201d\nprovides an account of how the principles of economics can be true\nceteris paribus (Hausman 1992, ch. 8, 12).\n\nBecause economic theory includes only the most important causes and\nnecessarily ignores minor causes, its claims, like claims concerning\ntides, are inexact. Its predictions will be imprecise, and sometimes\nfar off. Mill maintains that it is nevertheless possible to develop\nand confirm economic theory by studying in simpler domains the laws\ngoverning the major causal factors and then deducing their\nconsequences in more complicated circumstances. For example, the\nstatistical data are ambiguous concerning the relationship between\nminimum wages and unemployment of unskilled workers; and since the\nminimum wage has never been extremely high, there are no data about\nwhat unemployment would be in those circumstances. On the other hand,\neveryday experience teaches economists that firms can choose among\nmore or less labor-intensive processes and that a high minimum wage\nwill make more labor-intensive processes more expensive. On the\nassumption that firms try to keep their costs down, economists have\ngood (though not conclusive) reason to believe that a high minimum\nwage will increase unemployment.\n\nIn defending a view of economics as in this way inexact and employing\nthe method a priori, Mill thought he was able to reconcile his\nempiricism and his commitment to Ricardo\u2019s economics. Although\nMill\u2019s views on economic methodology were challenged later in\nthe nineteenth century by economists who believed that theory was too\nremote from the contingencies of policy and history (Roscher 1874,\nSchmoller 1888, 1898), Mill\u2019s methodological views dominated the\nmainstream of economic theory for a century (for example, Cairnes\n1875). Mill\u2019s vision survived the so-called neoclassical\nrevolution in economics beginning in the 1870s and is clearly\ndiscernible in the most important methodological treatises concerning\nneoclassical economics, such as John Neville Keynes\u2019 The\nScope and Method of Political Economy (1891) or Lionel\nRobbins\u2019 An Essay on the Nature and Significance of Economic\nScience (1932). Hausman (1992) argues that current methodological\npractice closely resembles Mill\u2019s methodology, despite the fact\nthat few economists explicitly defend it.\n\nAlthough this way of interpreting Mill and the methodology of\neconomics is coherent and conforms to an old-fashioned empiricist\nphilosophy of science that finds the nomological force of\ngeneralizations in their universality, it is not faithful to the way\nin which economists see their theories. Rather than regarding\ngeneralizations such as acquisitiveness as universal laws carrying\nimplicit ceteris paribus qualifications in their antecedents,\neconomists are much more likely to regard these generalizations as\n\u201ctendencies\u201d that continue to operate even when defeated\nby interferences and that need to be studied separately (Woodward\n2003). Even Mill speaks of tendencies, though without reconciling his\ntalk of tendencies with his empiricism. If one sets aside metaphysical\nqualms about tendencies and counterfactuals, the most natural way to\nsee economic theorizing is as the counterfactual investigation of\ncombinations of tendencies. As the discussion below of models\nconfirms, such views are congenial to economists and puzzling to\nphilosophers with empiricist scruples.\n\nConceptualizing of economic inquiry as the study of models and\ntendencies, seems to shift the terms of the problems posed by\ninexactness rather than to offer a solution. Julian Reiss has, in\neffect, rediscovered the problem in an influential essay, \u201cThe\nExplanation Paradox.\u201d (2013), where he argues that the following\nthree propositions are inconsistent: (1) Economic models are false.\n(2) Economic models are explanatory. (3) Explanation requires\ntruth.The formulation is a bit obscure, since models are not single\nsentences or propositions that can be true or false, but it should be\nclear that Reiss\u2019s putative paradox is a reformulation of the\nproblem posed by the inexactness of economic theories or models.\n",
