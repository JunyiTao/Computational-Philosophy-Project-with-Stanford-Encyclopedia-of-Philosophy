    "main_text": "Free algebras || Free combinatorial structures\n6.3 Free combinatorial structures\n\nFrom the examples so far one might conclude that all free algebras on\none or more generators are infinite. This is by no means always the\ncase; as counterexamples we may point to a number of classes: sets,\npointed sets, bipointed sets, graphs, undirected graphs, Boolean\nalgebras, distributive lattices, etc. Each of these forms a locally\nfinite variety as defined earlier.\n\nA pointed set is an algebra with one constant, say \\(c\\). The free\npointed set on \\(x\\) and \\(y\\) has three elements, \\(x, y\\), and\n\\(c\\). A bipointed set is an algebra with two constants \\(c\\) and\n\\(d\\), and the free bipointed set on \\(x\\) and \\(y\\) then has four\nelements, \\(x, y, c\\), and \\(d\\).\n\nGraphs, of the oriented kind arising in say automata theory where\nmultiple edges may connect the same two vertices, can be organized as\nalgebras having two unary operations \\(s\\) and \\(t\\) satisfying\n\\(s(s(x)) = t(s(x)) = s(x)\\) and \\(t(t(x)) = s(t(x)) = t(x)\\). The\nfree graph on one generator \\(x\\) has three elements, \\(x, s(x)\\), and\n\\(t(x)\\), constituting respectively an edge and its two endpoints or\nvertices. In this framework the vertices are the elements\nsatisfying \\(s(x) = x\\) (and hence \\(t(x) = x\\) since \\(x = s(x) =\nt(s(x)) = t(x)\\)); all other elements constitute edges. The free graph\non \\(n\\) generators consists of \\(n\\) such edges, all independent.\nOther graphs arise by identifying elements. There is no point\nidentifying an edge with either another edge or a vertex since that\nsimply absorbs the first edge into the second entity. This leaves only\nvertices; identifying two vertices yields a single vertex common to\ntwo edges, or to the same edge in the identification \\(s(x) = t(x)\\)\ncreating a self-loop.\n\nThe term \u201coriented\u201d is to be preferred to\n\u201cdirected\u201d because a directed graph as understood in\ncombinatorics is an oriented graph with the additional property that\nif \\(s(x) = s(y)\\) and \\(t(x) = t(y)\\) then \\(x = y\\); that is, only\none edge is permitted between two vertices in a given direction.\n\nUnoriented graphs are defined as for graphs with an additional unary\noperation \\(g\\) satisfying \\(g(g(x)) = x\\) and \\(s(g(x)) = t(x)\\)\n(whence \\(s(x) = s(g(g(x))) = t(g(x)))\\). The free undirected graph on\n\\(x\\) consists of \\(x, s(x), t(x)\\), and \\(g(x)\\), with the pair \\(x,\ng(x)\\) constituting the two one-way lanes of a two-lane highway\nbetween \\(s(x) = t(g(x))\\) and \\(t(x) = s(g(x)\\)). Identification of\nelements of undirected graphs works as for their oriented\ncounterparts: it is only worth identifying vertices. However there is\none interesting twist here: vertices can be of two kinds, those\nsatisfying \\(x = g(x)\\) and those not. The latter kind of vertex is\nnow asymmetric: one direction of the bidirectional edge is identified\nwith its vertices while the other one forms an oriented loop in the\nsense that its other direction is a vertex. This phenomenon does not\narise for undirected graphs defined as those satisfying \u201cif\n\\(s(x) = s(y)\\) and \\(t(x) = t(y)\\) then \\(x = y\\).\u201d\n",
