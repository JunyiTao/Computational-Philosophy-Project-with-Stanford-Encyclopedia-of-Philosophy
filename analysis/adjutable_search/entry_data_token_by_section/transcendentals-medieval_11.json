The Transcendental \u2018Good\u2019\n\n\nWhereas the transcendental \u2018true\u2019 imposes its\ndifficulties to qualify as a property of being as being, the indication\nof which was Aristotle\u2019s exclusion of being of reason from\nmetaphysics, the transcendental \u2018good\u2019 raises the suspicion\nof a naturalistic fallacy, by making the ethical good depend upon the\ngood as a property convertible with being. In a sense, the same\ndifficulty presents itself with all the transcendental properties: the\nmetaphysical explication of the concept of \u2018being\u2019\n(ens) in the \u2018most common notions\u2019\n(communissima), \u2018one\u2019 (unum),\n\u2018true\u2019 (verum), and \u2018good\u2019\n(bonum), competes with the consideration of these notions in\nanother science, in which they are principal: the one in mathematics,\nthe true in logic, and the good in ethics.\n\n\nThe metaphysics of the good, as it is conceived in the thesis of the\nconvertibility of the good and being in the medieval doctrines of the\ntranscendentals, was central in the early elaboration of the doctrine.\nIts central inspiration was Aristotle\u2019s critique on Plato\u2019s\nIdea of the Good in the first book of the Nicomachean\nEthics, which proclaimed the transgeneric and analogical\ncharacter of the good and opened with an authoritative definition:\n\u201cthe good is that which all desire.\u201d (Arist., Eth. Nic. I,\nc. 1, 1094a2\u20133) Medieval authors could rely on Boethius\u2019 De\nhebdomadibus for an explanation of the goodness of reality, which\nbuilds basically on its being created by what is essentially good; the\ntreatise is an exemplary harmonization of the Platonic and Aristotelian\ntraditions, which assert the transcendence resp. the transcendentality\nof the good. Another important argument to account for the\nconvertibility of being and good is found in Aquinas, who connects the\nactuality of being with the proper character of the good as that which\nis desirable \u2013 since a thing is desirable only insofar as it is\nperfect, and is only perfect insofar as it is in act, the goodness of a\nthing depends on the actuality of its being. Aquinas\u2019 doctrine of\nthe transcendentals also provides a major model to think of the\nrelation between the metaphysical and the moral good, insofar as it is\nfoundational not only for the realm of theoretical reason, but also for\nthe realm of practical reason. In the same way as the first principle\nin theoretical reason, the principle of non-contradiction, is founded\non the concept of \u2018being\u2019 as first known in the theoretical\nrealm, the first principle in practical reason, the first precept of\nnatural law: \u201cGood is to be done and pursued, and evil\navoided,\u201d is founded on the concept of \u2018good\u2019 as\nfirst known in the practical realm. (See Kluxen 1964, 93\u2013100, &\nAertsen 1996, 326\u2013330.)\n\n\nInterestingly, the metaphysics of the good, which had been central\nin the early elaboration of the doctrine of the transcendentals, seems\nto have lost some of its appeal in the wake of a new concept of being.\nAlthough Henry of Ghent organizes his treatise on the good in\nSumma 41.1 in accordance with Aquinas\u2019 discussion of the\ngood in De ver. 21.1, the essentialist interpretation of the\nconcept of being that he established had only limited possibilities,\nand even less impulse, to account for the fundamental difference\nbetween the transcendental good and moral perfections. In Duns Scotus,\nthe good is an absolute property formally distinct from being; in\nSuarez, \u2018the good\u2019 primarily signifies the perfection of a\nthing, while adding the aspect of suitability (convenientia),\ni.e. it connotes a nature having a natural inclination, capacity, or\nconjunction with such perfection.\n",
