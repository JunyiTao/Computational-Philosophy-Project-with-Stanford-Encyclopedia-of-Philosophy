    "main_text": "Relative Identity\n3. Relative Identity\n\nThis situation provides the basis for Geach\u2019s radical contention\nthat the notion of absolute identity has no application and that there\nis only relative identity. This section contains a brief discussion of\nGeach\u2019s complex view. (For more details see the entry on\n relative identity,\n Deutsch 1997, Dummett 1981 and 1991, Hawthorne 2003 and Noonan 2017.)\nGeach maintains that since no criterion can be given by which a\npredicate expressing an I-predicate may be determined to express, not\nmerely indiscernibility relative to the language to which it belongs,\nbut also absolute indiscernibility, we should jettison the classical\nnotion of identity (1991). He dismisses the possibility of defining\nidentity in a second-order language on the ground of the paradoxical\nnature of unrestricted quantification over properties and aims his\nfire particularly at Quine\u2019s proposal that an I-predicate in a\nfirst-order theory may always be interpreted as expressing\nabsolute identity (even if such an interpretation is not\nrequired). Geach objects that Quine\u2019s suggestion leads\nto a \u201cBaroque Meinongian ontology\u201d and is inconsistent\nwith Quine\u2019s own expressed preference for \u201cdesert\nlandscapes\u201d (\u201cIdentity\u201d in Geach 1972: 245).\n\nWe may usefully state Geach\u2019s thesis using the terminology of\nabsolute and relative equivalence relations. Let us say that an\nequivalence relation R is absolute if and only if, if\nx stands in it to y, there cannot be some other\nequivalence relation S, holding between anything and either\nx or y, but not holding between x and\ny. If an equivalence relation is not absolute it is relative.\nClassical identity is an absolute equivalence relation. Geach\u2019s\nmain contention is that any expression for an absolute equivalence\nrelation in any possible language will have the null class as its\nextension, and so there can be no expression for classical identity in\nany possible language. This is the thesis he argues against Quine.\n\nGeach also maintains the sortal relativity of identity statements,\nthat \u201cx is the same A as y\u201d\ndoes not \u201csplit up\u201d into \u201cx is an\nA and y is an A and\nx=y\u201d. More precisely stated, what Geach denies\nis that whenever a term \u201cA\u201d is interpretable as a\nsortal term in a language L (a term which makes (independent)\nsense following \u201cthe same\u201d) the expression (interpretable\nas) \u201cx is the same A as y\u201d in\nlanguage L will be satisfied by a pair\n<x,y> only if the I-predicate of L is\nsatisfied by <x,y>. Geach\u2019s thesis of\nthe sortal relativity of identity thus neither entails nor is entailed\nby his thesis of the inexpressibility of identity. It is the sortal\nrelativity thesis that is the central issue between Geach and Wiggins\n(1967 and 1980). It entails that a relation expressible in the form\n\u201cx is the same A as y\u201d in a\nlanguage L, where \u201cA\u201d is a sortal term\nin L, need not entail indiscernibility even by the resources\nof L.\n\nGeach\u2019s argument against Quine exists in two versions, an\nearlier and a later.\n\nIn its earlier version the argument is merely that following\nQuine\u2019s suggestion to interpret a language in which some\nexpression is an I-predicate so that the I-predicate expresses\nclassical identity sins against a highly intuitive methodological\nprogramme enunciated by Quine himself, namely that as our knowledge\nexpands we should unhesitatingly expand our ideology, our stock of\npredicables, but should be much more wary about altering our ontology,\nthe interpretation of our bound name variables (1972: 243).\n\nGeach\u2019s argument is that in view of the mere possibility of\ncarving out of a language L, in which the relational\nexpressions, E1, E2,\nE3\u2026 are not I-predicates, sub-languages\nL1, L2,\nL3\u2026 in which these expressions are\nI-predicates, if Quine\u2019s suggested proposal of reinterpretation\nis possible for each Ln, the user of\nL will be committed to any number of entities not quantified\nover in L, namely, for each Ln,\nthose entities for which the I-predicate of\nLn (En)\ngives a criterion of absolute identity. This will be so because any\nsentence of L will retain its truth conditions in any\nLn to which it belongs, reinterpreted as\nQuine proposes, but \u201cof course, it is flatly inconsistent to say\nthat as a member of a large theory a sentence retains its\ntruth-conditions but not its ontological commitment\u201d\n(1973:299).\n\nThe crucial premiss of this argument is thus that sameness of\ntruth-conditions entails sameness of ontological commitment. But this\nis not true. The ontological commitments of a theory (according to\nQuine, whose notion this is) are those entities that must lie within\nthe domain of quantification of the theory if the theory is to be\ntrue; or, the entities the predicates of the theory have to be true of\nif the theory is to be true. A theory is not ontologically committed,\nwe may say, to whatever has to be in the universe for it to\nbe true, but only to whatever has to be in its universe for\nit to be true. Thus there is no argument from sameness of\ntruth-conditions to sameness of ontological commitments.\n\nThe later version of Geach\u2019s argument needs a different\nresponse. The difference between the earlier version and the later one\nis that in the later (to be found in Geach 1973) Geach\u2019s claim\nis not merely that Quine\u2019s thesis about possible\nreinterpretation has a consequence which is unpalatable, but that it\nleads to an out-and-out logical absurdity, the existence of what he\ncalls \u201cabsolute surmen\u201d (entities for which having the\nsame surname constitutes a criterion of absolute identity, i.e.,\nentails indiscernibility in all respects). Because Geach is now making\nthis stronger claim, the objection that his argument depends upon the\nincorrect assumption that sameness of truth-conditions entails\nsameness of ontological commitment is no longer relevant. In order to\nmake out his case Geach has to establish just two points. First, that\nthere are sentences of English supplemented by the predicate \u201cis\nthe same surman as\u201d (explained to mean \u201cis a man and has\nthe same surname as\u201d), which are evidently true and which,\nconsidered as sentences of that fragment of English in which \u201cis\nthe same surman as\u201d is an I-predicate, when this is interpreted\nin the way Quine suggests, can be true only if absolute surmen exist.\nAnd secondly, that the existence of absolute surmen is absurd.\n\nBut in the end Geach fails to establish these two points. Quine would\nsay that, for the fragment of English in question, the domain of the\nvariables can be considered to consist of classes of men with the same\nsurname and the predicates interpreted as holding of such classes.\nThus, the predicate \u201cis the same surman as\u201d will no longer\nbe true of pairs of men if we adopt Quine\u2019s suggestion\n(I am writing, remember in English, not in the fragment of English\nunder discussion), but rather of pairs of classes of men with the same\nsurname \u2013 these then will be Geach\u2019s \u201cabsolute\nsurmen\u201d. Now, Geach attempts to rule this out by the argument\nthat \u201cwhatever is a surman is by definition a man.\u201d But\nthis argument fails. The predicate \u201cis a man\u201d will also be\nin the language-fragment in which \u201cis the same surman as\u201d\nis the I-predicate; and so it, too, will, be reinterpreted, if we\nfollow Quine\u2019s suggestion, as holding of classes of men with the\nsame surname. Thus the sentence \u201cWhatever is a surman is a\nman\u201d will be true in the language fragment interpreted in\nQuine\u2019s way, just as it is in English as a whole. What will not\nbe true, however, is that whatever the predicate \u201cis a\nsurman\u201d is true of, as it occurs in the language-fragment\nreinterpreted in Quine\u2019s way, is a thing of which \u201cis\na man\u201d, as it occurs in English as a whole, is true of.\nBut Geach has no right to demand that this should be the case. Even\nso, this demand can be met. For the domain of the interpretation of\nthe language fragment in which \u201cis the same surman as\u201d is\nthe I-predicate can, in fact, be taken to consist of men, namely, to\nbe a class containing exactly one representative man for each class of\nmen with the same surname. Thus, as Geach says, absolute surmen will\nbe just some among men (1973, 100). Geach goes on, \u201cthere will,\nfor example, be just one surman with the surname \u2018Jones\u2019,\nbut if this is an absolute surman, and he is a certain man, then which\nof the Jones boys is he?\u201d But this question, which is, of\ncourse, only answerable using predicates which belong to the part of\nEnglish not included in the language fragment in which \u201cis the\nsame surman as\u201d is the I-predicate, is not an impossible one to\nanswer. It is merely that the answer will depend upon the particular\ninterpretation that the language fragment has, in fact, been given.\nGeach is, therefore not entitled to go on, \u201cSurely we have run\ninto an absurdity.\u201d It thus seems that his argument for the\nnon-existence of absolute identity fails.\n\nGeach\u2019s argument for his second thesis, that of the sortal\nrelativity of identity, is that it provides the best solution to a\nvariety of well known puzzles about identity and counting at a time\nand over time. The most well known puzzle is that of the cat on the\nmat, which comes in two versions.\n\nThe first version goes like this. (Wiggins 1968 contains the first\nappearance of this version in present-day philosophical literature; an\nequivalent puzzle is that of Dion and Theon, see Burke 1995.) Suppose\na cat, Tibbles, is sitting on a mat. Now consider that portion of\nTibbles that includes everything except its tail \u2013 its\n\u201ctail complement\u201d \u2013 and call it \u201cTib\u201d.\nTib is smaller than Tibbles so they are not identical. But what if we\nnow amputate the cat\u2019s tail? (A time-reversed, or\n\u201cgrowing\u201d, version can be considered in which a tail is\ngrafted on to a tailless cat; the same responses considered below will\nbe available, but may differ in relative plausibility.) Tibbles and\nTib will now coincide. If Tibbles is still a cat, it is hard to see by\nwhat criterion one could deny that Tib is a cat. Yet they are distinct\nindividuals, since they have different histories. But there is just\none cat on the mat. So they cannot be distinct cats. They must be the\nsame cat, even though they are distinct individuals; and so identity\nunder the sortal concept cat must be a relative identity\nrelation.\n\nThe second version (presented in Geach 1980, compare Unger 1980) goes\nas follows. Tibbles is sitting on the mat and is the only cat sitting\non the mat. But Tibbles has at least 1,000 hairs. Geach continues:\n\nNow let c be the largest continuous mass of feline tissue on\nthe mat. Then for any of our 1,000 cat-hairs, say\nhn, there is a proper part\ncn of c which contains precisely\nall of c except the hair hn; and\nevery such part cn differs in a\ndescribable way both from any other such part say\ncm, and from c as a whole.\nMoreover, fuzzy as the concept cat may be, it is clear that\nnot only is c a cat, but also any part\ncn is a cat:\ncn would clearly be a cat were the hair\nhn to be plucked out, and we cannot\nreasonably suppose that plucking out a hair generates a cat,\nso cn must already have been a cat.\n(Geach 1980, 215)\n\n\nThe conclusion, of course, is the same as in the previous version of\nthe argument: there is only one cat on the mat so all the distinct\nentities that qualify as cats must be the same cat.\n\nThis version of the argument can be resisted by insisting that the\nconcept of a cat is maximal, i.e. no proper part of a cat is a cat.\nThe first version may be resisted in a variety of ways. Some deny the\nexistence of the tail-complement at all (van Inwagen 1981, Olson\n1995); others deny that the tail-complement survives the amputation\n(Burke 1995). Another possibility is to say that certain of the\nhistorical and/or modal predicates possessed by Tibbles and not Tib\nare essential to being a cat, so that Tib is not (predicatively) a cat\n(Wiggins 1980). Again, it can be accepted that both Tib and Tibbles\nare cats, but deny that in counting them as one we are counting by\nidentity, rather, we are counting by \u201calmost identity\u201d\n(Lewis 1993). Another possibility is to accept that both Tib and\nTibbles are cats, but deny that they are distinct: rather\n\u201cTib\u201d and \u201cTibbles\u201d are two names of the same\ncat-stage (Hawley 2001, Sider 2001).\n\nThere is, then, no very compelling argument for Geach\u2019s sortal\nrelativity thesis to be based on such examples, given the variety of\nresponses available, some of which will be returned to below. On the\nother hand, no alternative solution to the puzzle of the cat on the\nmat stands out as clearly superior to the rest, or clearly superior to\nthe sortal relativity thesis as a solution. We should conclude that\nthis component of Geach\u2019s position, though not proven, is not\nrefuted either, and, possibly, that the linguistic data provide no\nbasis for a decision for or against.\n",
