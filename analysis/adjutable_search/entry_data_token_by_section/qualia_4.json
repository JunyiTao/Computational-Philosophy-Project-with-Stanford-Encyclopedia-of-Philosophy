    "main_text": "Qualia and the Explanatory Gap\n5. Qualia and the Explanatory Gap\n\nOur grasp of what it is like to undergo phenomenal states is supplied\nto us by introspection. We also have an admittedly incomplete grasp of\nwhat goes on objectively in the brain and the body. But there is, it\nseems, a vast chasm between the two. It is very hard to see how this\nchasm in our understanding could ever be bridged. For no matter how\ndeeply we probe into the physical structure of neurons and the\nchemical transactions which occur when they fire, no matter how much\nobjective information we come to acquire, we still seem to be left\nwith something that we cannot explain, namely, why and how\nsuch-and-such objective, physical changes, whatever they might be,\ngenerate so-and-so subjective feeling, or any subjective feeling at\nall. \n\nThis is the famous \u201cexplanatory gap\u201d for qualia (Levine\n1983, 2000). Some say that the explanatory gap is unbridgeable and\nthat the proper conclusion to draw from it is that there is a\ncorresponding gap in the world. Experiences and feelings have\nirreducibly subjective, non-physical qualities (Jackson 1993; Chalmers\n1996, 2005). Others take essentially the same position on the gap\nwhile insisting that this does not detract from a purely physicalist\nview of experiences and feelings. What it shows rather is that some\nphysical qualities or states are irreducibly subjective entities\n(Searle 1992). Others hold that the explanatory gap may one day be\nbridged but we currently lack the concepts to bring the subjective and\nobjective perspectives together. On this view, it may turn out that\nqualia are physical, but we currently have no clear conception as to\nhow they could be (Nagel 1974). Still others adamantly insist that the\nexplanatory gap is, in principle, bridgeable but not by us or by any\ncreatures like us. Experiences and feelings are as much a part of the\nphysical, natural world as life, digestion, DNA, or lightning. It is\njust that with the concepts we have and the concepts we are capable of\nforming, we are cognitively closed to a full, bridging explanation by\nthe very structure of our minds (McGinn 1991).\n\nAnother view that has been gaining adherents of late is that there is\na real, unbridgeable gap, but it has no consequences for the nature of\nconsciousness and physicalist or functionalist theories thereof. On\nthis view, there is nothing in the gap that should lead us to any\nbifurcation in the world between experiences and feelings on\nthe one hand and physical or functional phenomena on the other. There\naren\u2019t two sorts of natural phenomena: the irreducibly\nsubjective and the objective. The explanatory gap derives from the\nspecial character of phenomenal concepts. These concepts\nmislead us into thinking that the gap is deeper and more troublesome\nthan it really is.\n\nOn one version of this view, phenomenal concepts are just indexical\nconcepts applied to phenomenal states via introspection (see Lycan\n1996). On an alternative version of the view, phenomenal concepts are\nvery special, first-person concepts different in kind from all others\n(see Tye 2003). This response to the explanatory gap obviously bears\naffinities to the second physicalist response sketched in Section 3 to\nthe Knowledge Argument. Unfortunately, if the appeal to phenomenal\nconcepts by the physicalist is misguided, then it cannot be used to\nhandle the gap.\n\nThere is no general agreement on how the gap is generated and what it\nshows.\n",
