They argue that the term is\nboth too vague and too restrictive. It is too vague, they believe,\nbecause it does not provide a unique parsing of the genome. Borders\nbetween genes are overlapping and allegedly ambiguous. It is not\nclear, they argue, whether genes include or exclude introns,\nregulatory regions, and so forth. The term is allegedly too\nrestrictive because it obscures the diversity of molecular elements\nplaying different roles in the expression and regulation of DNA. In\naddition, any attempt to resolve the ambiguities, these skeptics\nargue, will make the term even more restrictive.\n\n\nKeller's account of the history of twentieth century genetics seems to\nreinforce gene skepticism. For example, she argues that the question\nabout what genes are for has become increasingly difficult to answer\n(Keller 2000). By the end of the twentieth century, she says,\nbiological findings have revealed a complexity of developmental\ndynamics that make it impossible to conceive of genes as distinct\ncausal agents in development. Keller emphasizes that words have power\nand devotes a good deal of attention to the way loose gene talk has\naffected biological research by reinforcing the assumption that the\ngene is \u201cthe core explanatory concept of biological structure\nand function\u201d (Keller 2000, p. 9), an assumption with which she\nstrongly disagrees. Yet Keller does not endorse the view of gene\nskeptics who argue that biology would be improved if biologists\nstopped talking about \u201cgenes\u201d and restricted themselves to\nterms designating molecular units such as nucleotide, codon, coding\nregion, promotor region, and so on. Keller maintains that the term\ngene continues to have \u201cobvious and undeniable\nuses.\u201d\n\n\nOne use of the term gene, according to Keller, is that its\nvagueness, the very feature that troubles philosophers, makes it\npossible for biologists to be flexible, to communicate across\ndisciplinary boundaries, and to think in new ways:\n\n\n\nThe meaning of an experimental effect depends on its relation to\nother effects, and the use of language too closely tied to particular\nexperimental practices would, by its very specificity, render\ncommunication across difference experimental contexts effectively\nimpossible. (Keller 2000, p. 140).\n\n\n\nKeller identifies a second reason that gene talk is useful.\nThe term gene applies to entities that can be experimentally\nmanipulated to produce definite and reproducible effects (though given\nKeller's criticism of gene concepts, it is unclear to what entities\nshe thinks the term refers). She suggests that genes are short-term\ncauses. She points out, however, that this does not mean genes are\nlong-term causes or that genes are the fundamental causal agents of\ndevelopment. Rather, what it means (and Keller thinks this is an\nimportant reason why gene talk will continue) is that genes can be\nused as handles to manipulate biological processes (also see Waters\n2000). And for these two reasons, Keller concludes,\ngene talk will and should continue to play an important role in\nbiological discourse.\n",
