Within D4, there are four Arguments with the\nfollowing Conclusions: If the one is, then the others are not one\n(D4A1C), the others are not many (D4A2C1), the others are not a whole\n(D4A2C2), the others do not have parts (D4A2C3), the others are not\nlike (D4A3C1), the others are not unlike (D4A3C2), the others are not\nboth like and unlike (D4A3C3), the others are not the same (D4A4C1),\nthe others are not different (D4A4C2), the others are not in motion\n(D4A4C3), the others are not at rest (D4A4C4), the others are not\ncoming to be (D4A4C5), the others are not ceasing to be (D4A4C6), the\nothers are not greater (D4A4C7), the others are not equal (D4A4C8),\nand the others are not less (D4A4C9).\n\n\nAll of the individual Arguments in D4 are logically interconnected, and\nconnected to Arguments within previous Deductions. (For details,\nsee Rickless (2007, 207\u2013211).)\n\n\nIt appears that all of the Arguments in D4 are valid. Like the\nArguments of the first three Deductions, the Arguments of D4 rest on a\nnumber of independent premises, including premises of D1 and D2 (but\nnot D3). Again, it appears that most of the premises are, at\nleast from Plato\u2019s point of view, either definitionally true or\nself-evident. There is one major exception to this claim,\nhowever. All of the Arguments of D4 depend for their soundness on\nthe soundness of D1A2. But D1A2 depends for its soundness on the\nsoundness of D1A1, which itself depends for its soundness on the truth\nof Purity-F.\n\n\nSo we can redescribe the Conclusion of D4 as follows: If Purity-F\nis true, then if the one is, then the others do not have a host\nof contrary properties. This means that D3 and D4 together entail that\nif the one is, then Purity-F is false. For, by D3, if the one is, then\nthe others are both F and con-F. But, by D4, if\nPurity-F is true and the one is, then the others are\nneither F nor con-F. So, if Purity-F is true and the\none is, then the others have a host of contradictory\nproperties. Given that it is impossible for anything to have\ncontradictory properties, it follows directly that if the one is, then\nPurity-F is false.\n",
