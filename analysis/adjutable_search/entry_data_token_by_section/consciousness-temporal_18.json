    "main_text": "Temporal Consciousness and the Metaphysics of Time || Competing Conceptions of Time\n8.1 Competing Conceptions of Time\n\nIf there are very different accounts of the nature of temporal\nexperience, the same applies to time itself\u2014the time which\nexists in the wider physical universe, rather than time confined to\nhuman consciousness. Let us take a brief look at these differing\nconceptions before considering the complex issue of how universe-time\nand experienced-time are related.\n\nOne central issue concerning universe-time can be encapsulated is this\nsimple question: \u201cDoes time pass?\u201d Temporal passage can be\ncharacterized in a number of ways, but at the very least passage is\nassociated with the idea that the present is metaphysically privileged\nand steadily advancing, and this advance entails that future times\nwill become present, that present times and events will become past,\nand that past times become ever more past with every passing\nmoment. But while few deny that time seems to pass\u2014and indeed,\nthat this passage is (along with dimensionality) the most obvious\ndifference between time and space\u2014there are many who have denied\nthat time really does pass. Of these a few share\nMcTaggart\u2019s view that time cannot pass because time does not\nexist.\n\nA more popular view, these days at least, is the view that while time\ncertainly exists, it is more akin to space than it superficially\nseems. Proponents of the four-dimensional \u201cblock\nuniverse\u201d\u2014also known as eternalism\u2014hold\nthat there is no ontological distinction between past, present and\nfuture, and that all times are equally real. They further hold that\nthere is no unique privileged present time, and a fortiori\nthat there is no such thing as a moving present. Block\ntheorists face a significant challenge: Why does time seem to pass if\nit doesn\u2019t? Part of the explanation lies in the way our memories\naccumulate, and intentions and decisions translate into actions (see\nIsmael 2011, 2013, 2016). Another part of the explanation lies in the\ncharacter of our experience. Time per se may not pass or\nflow, but there is something akin to passage and flow in our immediate\nexperience\u2014phenomenal passage we can call it\u2014or\nso many believe.\n\nThe block conception of time has its advantages. It has an appealing\nsimplicity, and accords well with Einstein\u2019s relativity\ntheories, to mention but two. But the rejection of objective temporal\npassage is not to everyone\u2019s taste, and other conceptions of\ntime also have their advocates. The main contenders are depicted in\n Figure 8.1\n below. At the opposite extreme to the 4-D block view is\npresentism, the doctrine that concrete reality is confined to\nthe momentary present. Presentists deny any reality to the past or\nfuture. Coming in between these extremes is the growing block\nmodel. According to the latter, the past is real but the future is\nnot, and the sum total of reality is gradually increasing, by a\nprocess of moment-by-moment absolute becoming. On this view the\npresent is merely the most recent addition to reality; it is also the\ninterface between being and non-being. The moving spotlight\nmodel is in one respect akin to the standard block model: it accords\nreality to all times and events, including those yet to occur. It\ndiffers from the latter by virtue of the fact that it incorporates\nobjective passage into the universe, in the shape of a privileged (and\nconstantly advancing) present\u2014indicated by the blue line.\n\n\n\nFigure 8.1 Four conceptions of the\nlarge-scale composition of the universe. [An\n extended description of figure 8.1\n is in the supplement.]\n\n\nWhat McTaggart labelled the \u201cA-series\u201d runs from the\ndistant past, up through the recent past to the present, and then on\nto the future. The \u201cB-series\u201d is the series of positions\nwhich runs from earlier to later, and vice-versa. Properties such\nbeing past, present, or future are often\nknown as \u201cA-properties\u201d, whereas being earlier\nthan, being later than, and being simultaneous\nare known as \u201cB-properties\u201d or \u201cB-relations\u201d.\nThe block or eternalist conception of time is also often called\n\u201cthe B-theory\u201d. The opposed dynamic conceptions of time\nare often called \u201cA-theories\u201d.\n\nHow do these different metaphysical conceptions of time accord with\nour competing realist accounts of temporal consciousness? One point\nseems more obvious that most. If reality is confined to a momentary\npresent in the way presentists usually maintain, then it is difficult\nto see how any form of the extensional approach can be true. Our\nimmediate experience cannot extend through time if time itself has no\nextension; if earlier and later stream-phases are experienced\ntogether, in the way extensional models require, then it\nseems very plausible to suppose that these phases must both exist. Or\nto put it another way: an experience which no longer figures in the\nsum total of reality is not in a position to be part of the same\nunified state of consciousness as an experience which does so\nfigure, any more than a non-existent brick can help hold up a wall. By\ncontrast, since retentional theorists have the option of holding that\nour experience of time takes no time\u2014objectively\nspeaking\u2014their position looks to be entirely compatible with\npresentism, and similarly for the cinematic\n model.[19]\n As for the 4-D block conception, it looks equally compatible with all\nthe main views of temporal consciousness. The retentional\ntheorists\u2019 momentary specious presents can exist in universes of\nthis sort, as can those of cinematic theorists, but so too can the\nnon-momentary specious presents to be found in extensional models.\n",
