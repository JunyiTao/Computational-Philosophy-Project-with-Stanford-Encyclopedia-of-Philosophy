    "main_text": "Some Important Distinctions || Relevant Concepts of God\n1.1 Relevant Concepts of God\n\nThe term \u201cGod\u201d is used with a wide variety of different\nmeanings.  These tend to fall, however, into two main groups. On the\none hand, there are metaphysical interpretations of the term: God is\na prime mover, or a first cause, or a necessary being that has its\nnecessity of itself, or the ground of being, or a being whose essence\nis identical with its existence. Or God is not one being among other\nbeings\u2014even a supremely great being\u2014but, instead, being\nitself. Or God is an ultimate reality to which no concepts truly\napply.\n\nOn the other hand, there are interpretations that connect the term\n\u201cGod\u201d in a clear and relatively straightforward way with\nreligious attitudes, such as those of worship, and with very important\nhuman desires, such as the desires that good will triumph, that\njustice be done, and that the world not be one where death marks the\nend of the individual\u2019s existence.\n\nWhat properties must something have if it is to be an appropriate\nobject of worship, and if it is to provide reason for thinking that\nthere is a reasonable chance that the fundamental human desires just\nmentioned will be fulfilled? A natural answer is that God must be a\nperson who, at the very least, is very powerful, very knowledgeable,\nand morally very good. But if such a being exists, then it seems\ninitially puzzling why various evils exist. For many of the very\nundesirable states of affairs that the world contains are such as\ncould be eliminated, or prevented, by a being who was only moderately\npowerful, while, given that humans are aware of such evils, a being\nonly as knowledgeable as humans would be aware of their\nexistence. Finally, even a moderately good human being, given the\npower to do so, would eliminate those evils.  Why, then, do such\nundesirable states of affairs exist, if there is a being who is very\npowerful, very knowledgeable, and very good?\n\nWhat one has here, however, is not just a puzzle, since the question\ncan, of course, be recast as an argument for the non-existence of\nGod.  Thus if, for simplicity, we focus on a conception of God as\nall-powerful, all-knowing, and perfectly good, one very concise way\nof formulating such an argument is as follows:\n\nIf God exists, then God is omnipotent, omniscient, and morally\nperfect.\nIf God is omnipotent, then God has the power to eliminate all\nevil.\nIf God is omniscient, then God knows when evil exists.\nIf God is morally perfect, then God has the desire to eliminate\nall evil.\nEvil exists.\nIf evil exists and God exists, then either God doesn\u2019t have the\npower to eliminate all evil, or doesn\u2019t know when evil exists, or\ndoesn\u2019t have the desire to eliminate all evil.\nTherefore, God doesn\u2019t exist.\n\n\nThat this argument is valid is perhaps most easily seen by a\nreductio argument, in which one assumes that the \nconclusion\u2014(7)\u2014is false, and then shows that the denial of (7),\nalong with premises (1) through (6), leads to a contradiction.  Thus\nif, contrary to (7), God exists, it follows from (1) that God is\nomnipotent, omniscient, and morally perfect.  This, together with (2),\n(3), and (4) then entails that God has the power to eliminate all\nevil, that God knows when evil exists, and that God has the desire to\neliminate all evil.  But when (5) is conjoined with the reductio\nassumption that God exists, it then follows via modus ponens from (6)\nthat either God doesn\u2019t have the power to eliminate all evil, or\ndoesn\u2019t know when evil exists, or doesn\u2019t have the desire to eliminate\nall evil.  Thus we have a contradiction, and so premises (1) through\n(6) do validly imply (7).\n\nWhether the argument is sound is, of course, a further question, for\nit may be that one or more of the premises is false.  The point here,\nhowever, is simply that when one conceives of God as unlimited with\nrespect to power, knowledge, and moral goodness, the existence of\nevil quickly gives rise to potentially serious arguments against the\nexistence of God.\n\nIs the situation different if one shifts to a deity who is not\nomnipotent, omniscient, and morally perfect?  The answer depends on\nthe details.  Thus, if one considers a deity who is omniscient and\nmorally perfect, but not omnipotent, then evil presumably would not\npose a problem if such a deity were conceived of as too remote from\nEarth to prevent the evils we find here.  But given a deity who falls\nconsiderably short of omnipotence, omniscience, and moral perfection,\nbut who could intervene in our world to prevent many evils, and who\nknows of those evils, it would seem that an argument rather similar\nto the above could be formulated by focusing not on the mere\nexistence of evil, but upon the existence of evils that such a deity\ncould have prevented.\n\nBut what if God, rather than being characterized in terms of\nknowledge, power, and goodness, is defined in some more metaphysical\nway\u2014for example, as the ground of being, or as being itself?  The\nanswer will depend on whether, having defined God in such purely\nmetaphysical terms, one can go on to argue that such an entity will\nalso possess at least very great power, knowledge, and moral\ngoodness.  If so, evil is once again a problem.\n\nBy contrast, if God is conceived of in a purely metaphysical way,\nand if no connection can be forged between the relevant metaphysical\nproperties and the possession of significant power, knowledge, and\ngoodness, then the problem of evil is irrelevant.  But when that is\nthe case, it would seem that God thereby ceases to be a being who is\neither an appropriate object of religious attitudes, or a ground for\nbelieving that fundamental human hopes are not in vain.\n",
