    "main_text": "Fate and Providence\n5. Fate and Providence\n\nSeveral months after Pomponazzi completed On Incantations in\n1520, he finished De fato, de libero arbitrio, et de\npraedestinatione (On Fate, Free Will, and\nPredestination), a work that addressed Alexander of\nAphrodisias\u2019s De fato (On Fate), which\nhad been printed in Girolamo Bagolino\u2019s Latin translation in\n1516. Alexander criticized Stoic deterministic understandings of\ncausation because they deny the possibility of chance, contingency,\nand human choice. In On Fate, Pomponazzi largely sided not\nwith Alexander but in favor of his Stoic opposition.\n\nThe premise of Pomponazzi\u2019s arguments coincides with his\nunderstanding of causation presented in On Incantations. The\nwork also reaffirms the limitations placed on the human intellect in\nOn the Immortality of the Soul. In On Fate,\nPomponazzi argued that God, as efficient cause of the world, acts on\nthe sublunary world using the celestial bodies. God is the principal\ncause, and the celestial bodies are the instrumental cause of\naccidental effects in the sublunary world, which Alexander and Thomas\nAquinas viewed as contingent and without a cause (1.7.II/15). The\ncelestial bodies\u2019 motion, contiguous to the lower world, drives\nand determines alterations on earth. Therefore, accidental effects,\nultimately resulting from God acting as an efficient cause, occur by\nnecessity (1.7.II/16). Pomponazzi maintained that they are mistakenly\ncalled contingent as a result of human ignorance of causes and future\nevents but not from any irregularity in matter, natural powers, or\ncelestial influences. Rather, all accidental effects and what appears\nto result from luck or chance can be traced back to fixed causes\n(1.7.II/23\u201326).\n\nApplying this deterministic framework, Pomponazzi rejected\nAlexander\u2019s understanding of free will as the ability to choose\nbetween alternatives. Pomponazzi maintained that human will functions\njust like the rest of nature. It depends on an eternal, external\nmover, namely God\u2019s will and the celestial\nmotions (1.9.2.10). Just as for other natural beings, if there is\na potentiality and no impediment, by necessity the potentiality will\nbe realized. Thus, the human will reacts to external factors according\nto its powers and the absence of impediments (1.9.2.12). Consequently,\nthe human will depends on higher, universal causes. The apparent\nability of humans to deliberate between choices using reason, however,\nis an illusion because every actor is in fact directed toward one of\nthe choices by external causes (1.9.3.2\u20134).\n\nThe rejection of the existence of free will presented difficult\nramifications for Christian ethics and theology, which depend on the\nfreedom to choose a virtuous life. In resolving these difficulties,\nPomponazzi chose fate over freedom because he thought that it better\npreserved God\u2019s complete power and providence. If God had\ngranted freedom to humans, the lack, or extreme rarity, of truly\nvirtuous humans on earth demonstrates the absence of a truly\nprovidential plan in which humans\u2019 freedom to choose a completely\nmoral good life is realized. Similarly, if humans have the ability of\nfree choice, God must not know these future decisions and humans are\nthereby limited with respect to his knowledge and power. As a\nconsequence, Pomponazzi opted for fate and determinism, rejecting what\nhe considered to be a denial of God\u2019s providence, omnipotence,\nand omniscience. The world\u2019s order and the cosmic laws that\ngovern the eternal motions of the universe include the existence of\ngood and evil as part of the necessary cycles of change.\n\nAt the beginning of the third book, Pomponazzi maintained that his\nnaturalistic arguments (argumentationes naturales) of the\nfirst two books were by no means certain and were to be rejected if\nthey contradicted the teachings of the Catholic Church (3.1.1). He\nthen proposed to find solutions to the questions of fate and divine\nprovidence that preserve free will. Accordingly, Pomponazzi, seemingly\nin opposition to the arguments outlined in the first two books, opened\nthe door for the possibility of freedom of choice that potentially\ncould be in line with Christian theology by identifying the human will\nwith the intellect. He argued that God limited his omnipotence and\nforeknowledge, thereby allowing for the possibility of future\ncontingents. This divine self-limitation allows for the possibility\nthat the human intellect, through the power of deliberation, is\ncapable of suspending predetermined acts of volition that go against\nthe moral interests of the actor, thereby being able to choose to sin\nor not sin. Human liberty is defined in negative terms, a privation\nand a suspension, since the will does not produce action in these\ninstances but only impedes it (3.8). While some commentators have seen\nthis line of argumentation as a potential \u201cline of defense for\nthe opinio christiana\u201d (Poppi 1988: 659), it was\nspecifically condemned in 1576 by a censor who placed the work on the\nIndex of Prohibited Books (Baldini & Spruit 2009: vol. 1,\ntome 3: 2279\u201380).\n\nThe fifth and final book of On Fate continues the theological\ndiscussions of the previous two books, turning to an examination of\npredestination, a concept that according to Pomponazzi is not\nmentioned by philosophers but is key to Christian theology, being tied\nto doctrines on fate and God\u2019s providence. In this book, he put\nforward two distinct, incompatible accounts of predestination. The\nfirst account argues that God does not act in an indeterminate or\ncontingent manner and, therefore, has determined everything for\neternity, eliminating the importance or even the possibility of human\nchoice (5.2). The second account argues that God has created the\nuniverse perfect with respect to all its parts, including humans who\nhave the capacity to choose or refrain from sin. God,\nhowever, has not made all humans equal with respect to their ability\nto obtain perfection, and only some have been granted grace or are\n\u201celected\u201d. This election, or grace is not certain, as\nthose that have been chosen still have the possibility to choose to\nsin and thereby forfeit the grace that had been conceded to them. The\nchosen, however, who follow God\u2019s will can be certain to obtain\nthe glory that God has conditionally promised (5.7). The epilogue\nreiterates his conviction that the Stoic conception of the universe is\npreferable. He maintained that if the universe is like an animal, the\nsublunary world represents excrements, while the heavenly spheres are\nperfect and free of evil. Finally, he confessed that he has never\nunderstood how Christian theologians preserve divine providence and\nhuman free will, describing it as an illusion and a trick\n(5.epilogus.7\u201310).\n\nThat the first two books of On Fate at times seem to be in\ndisagreement with the latter three presents difficulties for\ninterpreting it, having led some scholars to assume Pomponazzi\u2019s\ntrue position corresponds to arguments in On Incantations\nand is found in the first books (see Poppi 1988). Others\nhave seen the last three books as an attempt to undermine Christianity\nby demonstrating the weakness or incompatibility of the Christian\ndoctrines of predestination and God\u2019s omnipotence and\nomniscience (see Di Napoli 1970). Alternatively, scholars have seen\nthe latter books to be a genuine attempt to critique and reform\nThomistic theology (see Perrone Compagni 2004: cix\u2013clviii) that\noffers innovative solutions to outstanding theological problems (see\nRamberti 2007: 109\u201350).\n",
