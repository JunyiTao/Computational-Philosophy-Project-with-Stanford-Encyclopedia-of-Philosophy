Theological Critiques of Analytic Philosophy of Religion\n\nWhile one set of critics accuse APR of becoming too theological,\nanother set takes the opposite line. According to several prominent\ntheologians and philosophers, something about the analytic style of\nphilosophizing makes APR particularly unsuitable for investigating\nChristian doctrines. On this line of criticism, far from becoming a\nspecies of Christian theology, APR is constitutively opposed to\nChristian theology, and the problem with analytic philosophical\ntheology is not that it is too theological but that it is too\nanalytic. This criticism takes several forms.\n\nSometimes, theological objections to APR simply reiterate Barthian\nobjections to natural theology, presumably on the assumption that most\nAPR is really a form of natural theology (Moore 2007). Other critics\ncharge analytic philosophers of religion with historical anachronism\nand ignorance of the Christian tradition. Perhaps\n\u201ca-historical\u201d analytic philosophers of religion do not\nunderstand pre-modern ways of thinking and reading (so runs the\ncharge), and so they wrongly believe that their own constructive work\nis congruent with the historic Christian tradition, when it in fact\ndepends modern assumptions that are inimical to the Christian\ntradition (Hart 2013: 123, 129; Milbank 2009: 320). Other critics\npress the related worry that APR ignores the real Christian tradition\naltogether in favor of theorizing its own abstract, self-constructed\nversion of the Christian god. Here APR\n\n\ndoes not deal with the God of any tradition or encounter, but with a\nconceptual construct, a simulacrum or \u2018the God of the\nphilosophers\u2019\u2026. (Oliver 2010: 467\u2013468; see also\nHyman 2010)\n\n\nAnother multi-faceted line of theological criticism criticizes APR for\n\u201cidolatry\u201d, \u201cunivocity\u201d, and\n\u201contotheology\u201d. This line reflects the general worry that\nAPR does not take divine mystery or transcendence seriously enough.\n\u201cOntotheology\u201d is a theological term of opprobrium that,\nin its current usage, derives from Heidegger (1957; see also Marion\n1982 [1995]). It means, roughly, treating God like \u201ca\nbeing\u201d or \u201ca thing in the world\u201d. According to its\ntheological critics, APR constitutively assumes that God is a possible\nobject of human knowledge, even apart from revelation, and therefore\ntreats God as fundamentally similar to any other object \u201cout\nthere\u201d passively waiting to be discovered. Yet a God like this\n(so runs the worry) is not really God at all, but something\nelse\u2014an idol.\n\nThe worry about ontotheology and idolatry is also a worry about\nunivocity\u2014the view that our terms bear the same meaning when\napplied to God and creatures (Trakakis 2010). According to opponents\nof theological univocity, precisely because God is not \u201ca\nbeing\u201d or a \u201cthing in the world\u201d, God and creatures\ndiffer absolutely; they share no properties and so cannot be described\nby univocal predications. (So, e.g., the word \u201cgood\u201d\ncannot have the same meaning in the statements \u201cGod is\ngood\u201d, and \u201cSocrates is good\u201d.) Worries about\ntheological predication and univocity date back to the Patristic\nperiod, but in contemporary philosophy of religion, they are best\nunderstood as continuations of the late medieval disputes between\nfollowers of Duns Scotus, who defends univocal predication, and his\nThomist opponents (T. Williams 2005; Burrell 2008; Cross 2008). As a\ngeneralization, most contemporary analytic philosophers of religion\nendorse a univocal account of theological language, whereas\ncontemporary Christian theologians are more likely to deny univocity\nin favor of analogical or metaphorical predication, or even\nnon-predicative forms of theological language (Pickstock 2005; Marion\n1999).\n\nNotwithstanding the sharp rhetoric, there has been very little direct\nengagement between analytic philosophers of religion and their\ntheological opponents on these questions. T. Williams (2005), Cross\n(2008) defend univocal predication, and Adams (2014) tries to\nrehabilitate ontotheology. Other analytic thinkers offer their own\npositive accounts of divine transcendence (Crisp and Rea [eds.] 2009:\n9\u201311; Rea 2015, 2020; Jacobs 2015). More generally, analytic\nphilosophers and theologians have a variety of strategies for avoiding\nthe deleterious consequences of univocity and ontotheology (Wood 2021:\n130\u201374). \n",
