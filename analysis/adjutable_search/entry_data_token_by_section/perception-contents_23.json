    "main_text": "Theories of Intentionality in Experience || Phenomenal Intentionality\n9. Directions for Future Research\n\nThere is much more research in philosophy to be done on the contents\nof experience. A great deal of theorizing has focused on visual\nexperiences. Even so, none of the questions discussed above are fully\nsettled, and so there is plenty of opportunity for further research on\nany of those topics. Additional topics ripe for future research\ninclude questions such as: what is the relation between perceptual\ncontent and perceptual contact with reality?; how do experiences in\ndifferent modalities interact?; what role does experiential content\nplay in reasoning, in intentional action and more generally in being\nan agent?; and how are perceptual constancies reflected in the\ncontents of experience?; what notion of contents of experience is most\ntheoretically useful for unconscious perception, and how may the\nlatter be distinguished among the varieties of subpersonal information\nprocessing?\n",
