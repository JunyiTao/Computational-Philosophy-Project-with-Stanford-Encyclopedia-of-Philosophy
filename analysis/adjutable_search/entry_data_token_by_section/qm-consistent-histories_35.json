    "main_text": "Difficulties and Objections || Nonuniqueness of quasiclassical frameworks\n11.4 Unicity\nIn a probabilistic theory the limiting cases of a probability equal\nto 1 or 0 are equivalent to asserting that the corresponding\nproposition (e.g., \u201cthe system has property \\(P\\)\u201d) is,\nrespectively, true or false. In the histories approach probabilities\nare linked to frameworks, and for this reason the notions of\n\u201ctrue\u201d and \u201cfalse\u201d are also framework\ndependent. This cannot lead to inconsistencies, a proposition being\nboth true and false, because of the single framework rule. But it is\ncontrary to a deeply rooted faith or intuition, shared by\nphilosophers, physicists, and the proverbial man in the street, that\nat any point in time there is one and only one state of the universe\nwhich is \u201ctrue\u201d, and with which every true statement about\nthe world must be consistent. In Sec. 27.3\nof Griffiths (2002a) this belief is\nreferred to as unicity, and it is what must be abandoned if\nthe histories interpretation of quantum theory is on the right\ntrack.\nAs an example, consider the measurement model\nin subsection 7.2, where in the family \\(\\FC_u\\) at\ntime \\(t_2\\) the measurement apparatus is in a superposition state\ncorresponding to a projector which is incompatible with the projectors\nrepresenting different pointer positions, which are employed in the\nfamily \\(\\FC_1\\). The histories approach says the physicist is at\nLiberty to employ either family, both of which are valid ways of\ndescribing the quantum world, but Incompatibility forbids combining\nthem into a single description. The prohibition on combining families\nis based on the fact that certain quantum projectors do not commute,\nsomething quite specific to quantum mechanics with no classical\ncounterpart. In classical mechanics the true state of affairs for a\nphysical system is always represented by a single point in the phase\nspace. It is this feature that has to be abandoned in quantum\nmechanics interpreted using histories. See the \nFurther Reading supplement for additional\ndetails.\n\n\nAbandoning unicity is certainly a radical proposal, comparable in\nthe history of science to the radical step our intellectual ancestors\ntook when they replaced the centuries old notion of an immovable earth\nwith the modern concept of a spinning planet in motion around the\nsun. In making that transition it was important to develop an\nunderstanding of why the earlier ideas worked so well; e.g., why one\ndid not feel the earth was moving. By analogy it is helpful to note,\nas discussed in section 6, that from a quantum\nperspective the macroscopic world of everyday experience can be\nunderstood for all, or almost all, practical purposes using a single\nquasiclassical framework. Within that framework the principle of\nunicity holds, and one can thus understand why it was quite\nsatisfactory before the quantum revolution, and remains so in sciences\nwhere specific quantum effects do not need to be taken into\naccount. See the \n Further Reading supplement for a more\nextended discussion.\n",
