    "main_text": "Meaning\n2. Meaning\n\nWe have distinguished two ways in which normativism about meaning can\nbe understood: ME normativism and MD normativism. The difference\nbetween the two, again, is that the MD normativist is committed to the\nmetaphysical priority of norms, since the norms are said to determine\nmeaning, while the ME normativist remains neutral on the issue of\nmeaning determination. Both versions of meaning normativism, however,\nclaim that the following is both necessary, and essential to, an\nexpression \\(e\\)\u2019s having meaning (for a speaker, or group of\nspeakers, \\(S\\) at a time \\(t)\\):\n\n(M)\n\\(e\\) means \\(M\\) for \\(S\\) at \\(t\\) only if a norm for \\(e\\) is\nin force for \\(S\\) at \\(t\\).\n\n\nHistorically, MD normativism is associated with Wittgenstein (in\nparticular the \u201cMiddle Period\u201d writings) and the tradition\nof appealing to linguistic conventions, prominent in the 1950s and\n1960s (in the writings of Grice, Lewis, Searle, and Strawson for\ninstance). ME normativism appeared on the philosophical scene more\nrecently, and is associated with Saul Kripke\u2019s book on\nWittgenstein\u2019s rule-following considerations (Kripke 1982). In\nthe book Kripke presents us with a meaning skeptic who challenges the\nvery idea that there are facts in virtue of which our terms have a\nmeaning. Kripke\u2019s skeptic puts down certain constraints on the\nrange of facts that could serve to determine meaning, among these that\nthe essentially normative character of meaning has to be respected.\nThe meaning determining fact, Kripke argues, must be such that it\nfollows from it how the term ought to be applied (1982: 11).\nEquipped with this normativity constraint the skeptic goes on to argue\nagainst all theories that fail to accommodate the required normative\ndimension of meaning, in particular dispositionalist theories\naccording to which meaning is determined by the speaker\u2019s\ndispositions to apply her terms (1982: 22\u201337).\n\nKripke\u2019s discussion reignited interest in the question of the\nrelation between meaning and rules, and resulted in an enormous\nliterature both on the skeptical argument and the very idea that\nmeaning is essentially normative. Much of that discussion has been\ncarried out without reference to the earlier debate on meaning and\nconventions, but attempts have also been made to relate the two\ndebates. In what follows we shall first discuss ME normativism, where\nthe discussion following Kripke\u2019s book plays a central role, and\nthen MD normativism.\n",
