Most\nproponents of a mechanistic turn in the philosophy of explanation\noppose a number of mainstream interpretations of core notions in the\nphilosophy of science, especially that of a scientific explanation, a\nlaw, the layer-cake model of a hierarchy of sciences (Wimsatt 1976),\nand the notion of a theory. Most often, mechanistic explanation is\ncharacterized as (i) being related to the use of \u2018by\u2019\nrather than \u2018because\u2019 (Craver 2007), (ii) being such that\nthe functioning of a complex entity is explained in terms of the\ncoordinated activation of its constituents, (iii) by being tied to a\nhierarchical order of local mechanisms, whose constituents can\nthemselves become the target of a mechanistic explanation, and (iv) by\nthe relevance of the notion of organization\u2014mechanisms are\norganized to do something. This is how Craver puts it:\n\n\nMechanistic explanations are constitutive or componential\nexplanations: they explain the behavior of the mechanism as a whole in\nterms of the organized activities and interactions of its components.\n(Craver 2007: 128)\n\n\nA number of aspects concerning the relation between reduction and\nmechanistic explanation are dealt with in the entry on\n reductionism in biology.\n Thus, suffice it to say that some philosophers, like Craver, reject a\nreductionist interpretation of mechanistic explanation (Craver 2007),\nwhereas others seem to suggest that a conservative form of\nreductionism may be compatible with mechanistic explanation (Bechtel\n2007 and, especially, Schaffner 2006). Interestingly, the example of\nthe reduction of headaches as described by Nagel (see above,\n Section 1)\n seems to suggest that he conceives of reductive explanation as\nmechanistic explanation. This is consonant with his first publication\non reduction: In his early paper on reduction (Nagel 1935), he\ndescribes reduction as a constitution relation. Van Riel (2014)\nsuggests that reductive explanation is a cognate of mechanistic\nexplanation.\n",
