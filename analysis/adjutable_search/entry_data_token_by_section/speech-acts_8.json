    "main_text": "Aspects of Illocutionary Force || Seven Components of Illocutionary Force\n3.3 Seven Components of Illocutionary Force\n\n\nIn an attempt to systematize and deepen Austin\u2019s approach, Searle and\nVanderveken 1985 distinguish between those illocutionary forces\nemployed by speakers within a given linguistic community, and the set\nof all possible illocutionary forces. While a certain linguistic\ncommunity may make no use of forces such as conjecturing or\nappointing, these two are among the set of all possible forces. (These\nauthors appear to assume that while the set of possible forces may be\ninfinite, it has a definite cardinality.) Searle and Vanderveken go on\nto define illocutionary force in terms of seven features, namely:\n\nIllocutionary point: This is the characteristic aim of\neach type of speech act. For instance, the characteristic aim of an\nassertion is to describe how things are, and perhaps also to bring\nabout belief in an addressee; the characteristic aim of a promise is\nto commit oneself to a future course of action.\nDegree of strength of the illocutionary point: Two\nillocutions can have the same point but differ along the dimension of\nstrength. For instance, requesting and insisting that the addressee do\nsomething both have the point of attempting to get the addressee to do\nthat thing; however, the latter is stronger than the former.\nMode of achievement: This is the special way, if any, in\nwhich the illocutionary point of a speech act must be\nachieved. Testifying and asserting both have the point of describing\nhow things are; however, the former also involves invoking one\u2019s\nauthority as a witness while the latter does not. To testify is to\nassert in one\u2019s capacity as a witness. Commanding and\nrequesting both aim to get the addressee to do something; yet only\nsomeone issuing a command does so in her capacity as a person\nin a position of authority.\nContent conditions: Some illocutions can only be achieved\nwith an appropriate propositional content. For instance, I can only\npromise what is in the future and under my control; or, at least, I\ncannot promise to do anything that it is obvious to myself and my\npromissee that I cannot do. So too, I can only apologize for what is\nin some sense under my control and already the case. (In light of our\ndiscussion above of semantics for non-indicative contents, this\ncondition could be recast in terms of imperatival, interrogative, and\npropositional content conditions.)\nPreparatory conditions: These are all other conditions\nthat must be met for the speech act not to misfire. Such conditions\noften concern the social status of interlocutors. For instance, a\nperson cannot bequeath an object unless she already owns it or has\npower of attorney; a person cannot marry a couple unless she is\nlegally invested with the authority to do so.\nSincerity conditions: Many speech acts involve the\nexpression of a psychological state. Assertion expresses belief;\napology expresses regret, a promise expresses an intention, and so\non. A speech act is sincere only if the speaker is in the\npsychological state that her speech act expresses.\nDegree of strength of the sincerity conditions: Two\nspeech acts might be the same along other dimensions, but express\npsychological states that differ from one another in the dimension of\nstrength. Requesting and imploring both express desires, and are\nidentical along the other six dimensions above; however, the latter\nexpresses a stronger desire than the former.\n\n\n\nSearle and Vanderveken (1985) suggest, in light of these seven\ncharacteristics, that each illocutionary force may be defined as a\nseptuple of values, each of which is a \u201csetting\u201d of a\nvalue within one of the seven characteristics. It follows, according\nto this suggestion, that two illocutionary forces\nF1 and F2 are identical just\nin case they correspond to the same septuple.\n",
