    "main_text": "Self-Consciousness in the History of Philosophy\n1. Self-Consciousness in the History of Philosophy\n\nA familiar feature of ancient Greek philosophy and culture is the\nDelphic maxim \u201cKnow Thyself\u201d. But what is it that one\nknows if one knows oneself? In Sophocles\u2019 Oedipus,\nOedipus knows a number of things about himself, for example that he\nwas prophesied to kill Laius. But although he knew this about himself,\nit is only later in the play that he comes to know that it is he\nhimself of whom it is true. That is, he moves from thinking that\nthe son of Laius and Jocasta was prophesied to kill Laius, to thinking\nthat he himself was so prophesied. It is only this latter\nknowledge that we would call an expression of self-consciousness and\nthat, we may presume, is the object of the Delphic maxim. During the\ncourse of the drama Oedipus comes to know himself, with tragic\nconsequences. But just what this self-consciousness amounts to, and\nhow it might be connected to other aspects of the mind, most notably\nconsciousness itself, is less clear. It has, perhaps unsurprisingly,\nbeen the topic of considerable discussion since the Greeks. During the\nearly modern period self-consciousness became central to a number of\nphilosophical issues and, with Kant and the post-Kantians, came to be\nseen as one of the most important topics in epistemology and the\nphilosophy of mind.\n",
