Subversive Contractarianism\n\nA descriptive use to which contractarianism has been put is to exploit\nthe exclusionary, in-group/out-group nature of the contractarian\nproject to illuminate the phenomenon of oppression. Carole Pateman\u2019s\nThe Sexual Contract (1989) uses contractarian theory to argue\nthat there has been an implicit contract among men to enforce\npatriarchy. She calls her approach a \u201cconjectural\nhistory,\u201d which she uses both to illuminate the actual history\nof patriarchal oppression of women and the ideology of social contract\ntheory. Similarly, Charles Mills argues in The Racial\nContract (1997) that whites have had an actual, historical,\nsometimes explicit, though often only implicit, contract to enforce\nwhite supremacy. The arguments are similar in their contractarian\noutlines, though they differ in the historical and factual details.\nAccording to both philosophers\u2019 theories, there are moral, political,\nand epistemological terms of the contract, and its effect has been to\nallow one group of persons effectively to dominate, subordinate, and\nexploit another group. The moral terms require the dominant group to\nevaluate the lives of their group more highly than those of the\nsubordinated, the political to deprive the subordinate group of\neffective political power, and the epistemological terms require the\nmembers of the dominant group to see themselves as intellectually\nsuperior to the dominated. The social contract then can be seen as a\njustification by the parties to the contract of their interaction, and\nof their exploitation of those who are not parties to the contract,\nbut only if the fundamental division of in-group and out-group is\naccepted. If the racial and sexual contracts were to be shown to be\nrational, they would constitute prima facie critiques of normative\ncontractarianism, since they would then seem to justify racism and\nsexism. Pateman and Mills have more recently teamed up in Contract\nand Domination (2007) to explore their similarities and ways in which\nthey diverge. Pateman extends her critique of the ideology of contract\nto the case of colonial appropriation of native peoples\u2019 lands with\nwhat she calls the \u201csettler contract.\u201d Mills also extends\nhis analysis both in scope to include gender and class, and to give a\nnormative application of the descriptive contract to the issue of\nreparations for slavery. He calls this more general contract the\n\u201cdomination contract.\u201d While Pateman holds that\ncontractarianism essentially permits domination, Mills holds that\ncontract theory can be salvaged by beginning with a more realistic\nnon-ideal starting point and asking how existing injustice ought,\nrationally be eliminated. However, his positive theory is\ncontractualist rather than contractarian, as it begins with the\npremise of moral equality.\n\nSeveral of the critiques surveyed above, then, center on the\nquestions: who is allowed to be a party to the contract, and how are\nthose who are excluded from the contract to be treated? On the\nnormative contractarian view, it is only rational to include all of\nthose who can both benefit and reciprocate benefits to others.\nNormative contractarianism, then, on the assumption that non-whites\nand women can both benefit and reciprocate benefits to others, shows\nthe sexual and racial contracts to be fundamentally irrational.\nGauthier, in fact, explicitly argued that his contractarianism aids\nthe feminist project of ending exploitative intimate relationships.\nContractarian morality disapproves of relationships that are not\nmutually advantageous without assuming ties of affection. He writes,\n\u201csociality \u2026 becomes a source of exploitation if it\ninduces persons to acquiesce in institutions and practices that but\nfor their fellow-feelings would be costly to them\u201d (1984, 11).\nThis theme is taken up in some defenses of feminist contractarianism\n(Hampton 1993). In the debate over contractarianism in feminist\nthought, there is a concern that contractualists beg the question of\nintrinsic value, and it is thought, in contrast, that (Hobbesian)\ncontractarianism can underwrite feminist claims about the exploitative\nnature of caring relationships without the intrinsic value assumption\n(Sample 2002). Lastly, in the hands of some philosophers social\ncontract theory becomes a device for combating oppression, especially\ngender oppression, by uncovering adaptive preferences formed under\nconditions of oppression (Walsh 2015).\n",
