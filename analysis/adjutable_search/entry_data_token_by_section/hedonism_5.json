    "main_text": "Ethical Hedonism || Other Arguments For Ethical Hedonism\n2.2 Other Arguments For Ethical Hedonism\n\n\nAt its simplest, ethical hedonism is the thesis that all and only\npleasure has positive non-instrumental importance and all and only pain\nor displeasure has negative non-instrumental importance. The focus\nbelow is on hedonism about value, and the discussion is intended to be\ngeneralizable also to other forms of ethical hedonism.\n\n\nConsider the following unification argument for hedonism about\nvalue: the case for the value of pleasure is stronger than the case for\nthe value of any non-pleasure; the more unified the theory of value the\nbetter it is; unification around the strongest case is better than\nunification around any other case; therefore: hedonism is the best\ntheory of value. This argument has weaknesses. Its first premise is not\nobviously true and needs further argument. In addition, the further\nargument that it still needs is in effect a separate argument for\nhedonism over its rivals, so this unification argument is not\nself-standing. Its second premise is also ambiguous between the claim\nthat a theory of value is in one respect better if it is more unified,\nand the claim that it is all-things-considered better if it is more\nunified. Plausibility requires the first interpretation, but the\nunification argument requires the second interpretation. In short,\nthere are significant problems with this unification argument for\nethical hedonism.\n\n\nHere is a motivation argument for hedonism about value: one's\nbasic motivation is always and only pleasure; all and only that which\nis one's basic motivation has value for one; therefore all and\nonly what is valuable for one is pleasure. On one interpretation, this\nargument appeals to a form of the motivational hedonist thesis that the\nonly object of our basic motives is pleasure. This form of motivational\nhedonism is questionable, as Section 1.2 discussed above. In addition,\nmotivational hedonism is most plausible as a claim about the role of\npleasure as an object of each of our motives, whether or not that\nobject actually exists in each case; whereas hedonism about value is\nmost plausible as a view just about real states or properties of\npleasure. Furthermore, this motivation argument depends on a\npro-attitude or motivation theory of value. It thus makes hedonism\nabout value an implication of, and in that respect dependent on, this\nform of subjectivism about value. On an alternative interpretation of\nthe motivation argument, its first premise is the pleasure-motive\nidentity thesis that our motives just are our pleasures (see\nHeathwood). For the motivation argument to bear fruit on this second\ninterpretation, its proponents need to show that this pleasure-motive\nidentity thesis is plausible.\n\n\nOne scientific naturalist argument for hedonism is this: in the\nvalue domain we should be scientific naturalists in our methods of\ninquiry; hedonism is the best option in respect of scientific\nnaturalism; therefore, we should be hedonists about value. Various\nissues arise. Both premises of the argument need support. First, what\nare scientific naturalist forms of inquiry into value, and why think\nthey should be adopted them in the value domain? One broadly scientific\nrationale for adopting such methods is the claim that their empirical\ntrack record is superior to that of philosophical theorising about\nvalue. But the thesis that naturalistic methods have a superior\nempirical track record or prospect is not obviously true and needs\nargument. A case also needs to be made that hedonism does do better\nthan its rivals in the scientific naturalist respect. Why think it has\nbetter naturalistic credentials, for example, than the numerous\nnon-hedonic and extra-hedonic mental states and properties, and the\nvarious forms of agency and of personal relationship, that are amongst\nthe promising rival or additional candidates for non-instrumental value\nstatus?\n\n\nConsider now this doxastic or belief argument for hedonism about\nvalue: all or most of us believe hedonism about value, albeit that some\nof us suffer from self-deception about that; and this state of our\nbeliefs supports hedonism itself. One response is that even if the\npremise is true it fails to support the conclusion. Consider\nstructurally similar cases. First, even if we all believe we have free\nwill and even if we cannot but believe this, it does not show that we\nactually have free will. Second, suppose instead that a strong general\nform of belief involuntarism is true, according to which we are not\nfree to have any beliefs other than those we do in fact have. Again,\nthis would not have any tendency to establish the truth of any of these\nbeliefs of ours, however robustly it might permit our having them. Any\nconvincing form of the doxastic or belief argument would need to\novercome such difficulties.\n\n\nPhenomenal arguments for hedonism move from some aspect of the felt\ncharacter of pleasure or pain to a thesis about the value of pleasure\nor pain.Some argue that pain or pleasure or both have felt character or\nfelt quality that generates reason to avoid or alleviate or minimize\nthe former and seek the latter (e.g., Nagel 1986: 156\u2013162). It might be\nthought that such phenomenal considerations can be deployed also in an\nargument for some form of ethical hedonism. One overall point is that\nthe most such phenomenal arguments can show is the sufficiency of\npleasure for value, and/or of pain for disvalue. Even if the relevant\nphenomenal character is unique to pleasure and pain, this can\nestablish at most that pleasure is necessary to phenomenal arguments\nfor value, and that pain is necessary to phenomenal arguments for\ndisvalue. It cannot show that pleasure and pain alone have\nnon-instrumental value. Phenomenal arguments also need to avoid appeal\nto any equivocation on \u2018quality\u2019. From the mere fact that\npain or pleasure has a certain felt quality in the sense of \u2018felt\ncharacter\u2019, it does not immediately follow that it has any felt\nquality in the sense of \u2018value\u2019 or\n\u2018disvalue\u2019.\n\n\nCan phenomenal arguments be strengthened? First, one might conjoin\nthe premise that pleasure has certain felt character with the premise\nthat all or most of us believe this felt character to be good. But this\nis just a doxastic argument again, plus a phenomenal account of the\nnature of pleasure. Second, one might instead appeal to the epistemic\nthesis that the felt character of pain and pleasure gives us direct\nawareness, perception or apprehension of the badness of pain and the\ngoodness of pleasure. One construal of this idea is that pleasure is an\nintentional feeling that has its own value or goodness as an object.\nEven if this thesis is granted, however, it is a general feature of\nintentional states that their objects might or might not exist. This\nbeing so, even if its own goodness is an intentional object of pleasure\nand its own badness is an intentional object of pain, it does not\nfollow that pleasure is good or that pain is bad. A third way to\ninterpret the phenomenal argument is as claiming that pleasure and pain\nare propositional feels that have feels-to-be-good and feels-to-be-bad\nintentional and phenomenal character, respectively. Again however, if\nsuch feels share the character of propositional attitudes in general,\nthen \u2018feels-to-be-good\u2019 does not entail\n\u2018is-good\u2019 and \u2018feels-to-be-bad\u2019 does not entail\n\u2018is-bad\u2019.\n\n\nCausal arguments for hedonism about value move from premises about\npleasure's causal relations to the conclusion that pleasure alone\nis valuable. One thing to note about the particular causal arguments\nfor hedonism that are discussed below (c.f. Crisp 2006: 120\u2013122) is\nthat they are in tension with doxastic arguments for hedonism (and with\nepistemic arguments, on which see below), because they counsel caution\nor even skepticism about the epistemic credentials of our\nhedonism-related beliefs.\n\n\nOne causal argument for hedonism is that autonomy, achievement,\nfriendship, honesty, and so on, generally produce pleasure, and this\nmakes us tend to think they have value of their own; in this way the\nvaluable pleasure produced by these non-pleasures tends to confound our\nthinking about what has value. Even granting that achievement,\nfriendship and the like tend to cause pleasure, however, why think this\nmerely instrumental consideration also causes us to think these\nnon-hedonic matters have their own non-instrumental value? Is there,\nfor instance, any empirical evidence for this claim? And even granted\nboth causal claims, why think these are the only causes of belief in\nnon-hedonism? Even granted that these are the only causes of\nnon-hedonist belief, why think these causes of belief justify it, and\nwhy think they are its only justifiers? Perhaps these questions all\nhave good hedonism-friendly answers, but that needs to be shown.\nAlternatively, perhaps this causal argument is instead exactly as good\nas the parallel causal argument from the thesis that pleasure generally\nproduces autonomy, achievement, and the like, to the opposite\nconclusion that hedonism is false.\n\n\nAnother causal argument for hedonism is that anti-hedonism about\nvalue is pleasure-maximizing; this tends to cause anti-hedonist belief;\nand it also justifies our having anti-hedonist belief without our\nneeding to think such belief true. As it stands, this argument is weak.\nThe issue is whether anti-hedonism is true, and this causal argument\nfails even to address that issue. Even if anti-hedonist belief has good\nor ideal consequences, and even if such consequences tend to produce\nsuch belief, this does not tend to establish either the truth or the\nfalsehood of anti-hedonism.\n\n\nExplanatory arguments for hedonism about value invite us to make a\nlist of the things that we regard as good or valuable, to ask of each\nof them \u2018why is it good?\u2019 or \u2018what explains its being\ngood?\u2019, to agree that all of the goodness or value of all but one\nsuch listed item is best explained by its generation of pleasure, and\nalso to agree that no satisfactorily explanatory answer can be given to\nsuch questions as \u2018why is pleasure good?\u2019 or \u2018what\nexplains pleasure's being good?\u2019. Proponents of the\nexplanatory argument then conclude in favour of hedonism about\nvalue.\n\n\nThose already sympathetic to hedonism about value should find\nexplanatory arguments congenial. It is a good question, partly\nempirical in nature, how the explanatory argument will strike those not\nalready inclined either for or against hedonism about value. Those\nalready sympathetic to non-hedonist pluralism about value, however, can\nreasonably respond with some scepticism to explanatory arguments for\nhedonism. They can hold that the non-instrumental value of each of\npleasure, knowledge, autonomy, friendship and achievement (or any other\ngood proposed instead) is best explained by its own non-instrumental\nfeatures. Subjectivists will add that these non-instrumental features\nare matters of each item's being some object of some actual or\ncounterfactual pro-stance. Objectivists will instead claim that the\nnon-instrumental features of pleasure, achievement, friendship,\nknowledge and autonomy that explain its value are independent of its\nbeing any object of any pro-stance. All parties can also agree that at\nleast part of the instrumental goodness or value of pleasure,\nknowledge, autonomy, friendship and achievement is best explained by\nits generation of pleasure.\n\n\nEpistemic arguments for hedonism about value claim that pleasure\nclearly or obviously has value (c.f. Crisp 2006: 124), and that nothing\nelse clearly does; and they conclude that this justifies belief in\nhedonism about value. But the assertion that pleasure's value\nclaims are clearer or more robust or more obvious than those of any\nother candidate for value status needs argument. Until this is\nsupplied, perhaps by doxastic, phenomenal, explanatory, or causal\narguments, epistemic arguments add little to the case for hedonism\nabout value.\n\n\nThis sub-section has outlined and reviewed some of the main forms of\nargument for hedonism about value: unification, motivation, scientific\nnaturalist, doxastic, phenomenal, explanatory, causal and epistemic\narguments. Arguments of each of these sorts could also be made for\nother forms of ethical hedonism. Each argument is problematical, but\nperhaps one or more of them can be made robust. Perhaps other promising\narguments for ethical hedonism might also be developed. Even if all\nsuch arguments fail, this would still not in itself be a convincing\noverall case against hedonism. The next sub-section examines arguments\nagainst ethical hedonism.\n",
