    "main_text": "Does altruism exist? || An a priori argument for psychological egoism\n2.3 An a priori argument for psychological egoism\n\nA second response on the part of the psychological egoist would\nconsist in an a priori philosophical argument for one or\nanother version of that doctrine. According to this line of thinking,\nwe can see \u201cfrom the armchair\u201d\u2014that is, without\nseeking empirical confirmation of any sort\u2014that psychological\negoism (in one of its forms) must be true.\n\nHow might such an argument go? Drawing upon some ideas that can be\nfound in Plato\u2019s dialogues, we might affirm two premises: (i)\nWhat motivates us to act is always a desire; (ii) all desires are to\nbe understood on the model of hunger (see Meno 77c;\nSymposium 199e\u2013200a, 204e).\n\nTo elaborate on the idea behind (ii): When we are hungry, our hunger\nhas an object: food (or perhaps some particular kind of food). But we\ndo not want to ingest the food for its own sake; what we are really\nafter is the feeling of satisfaction that we expect to get as a result\nof eating. Ingesting this or that piece of food is something we want,\nbut only as a means of achieving a sense of satisfaction or\nsatiation.\n\nIf all desire is understood in the same way, and all motivation takes\nthe form of desire, then we can infer that psychological egoism in its\nstrong form is true (and therefore its weaker versions are also true).\nConsider an action that seems, on the surface, to be altruistically\nmotivated: I give you a gift simply because I think you will like it.\nNow, since I want to give you this gift, and all desire should be\nunderstood as a kind of hunger, I am hungering after your feeling\npleased, as I hunger after a piece of food. But just as no one wants\nto ingest a piece of food for its own sake, I do not want you to feel\npleased for your sake; rather, what I am seeking is the feeling of\nsatisfaction I will get when you are pleased, and your being pleased\nis simply the means by which I achieve satisfaction. Accordingly, we\ndon\u2019t have to be keen observers of other people or look within\nourselves to arrive at psychological egoism. We can recognize that\nthis doctrine is correct simply by thinking about the nature of\nmotivation and desire.\n",
