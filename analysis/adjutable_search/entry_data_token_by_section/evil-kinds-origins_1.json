    "main_text": "Two Distinctions in Evil: Kinds and Origins\n2. Two Distinctions in Evil: Kinds and Origins\n\nThe late antique (Plotinus, Proclus, Augustine, Boethius), medieval\n(Anselm, Ibn Sina, Aquinas), and early modern (Descartes, Leibniz,\nBayle, Kant) eras contain sophisticated traditions of reflection on\nquestions about evil\u2014about its being or non-being, its intrinsic\nfeatures and natural manifestations, and its origins in nature, will,\nor supernature. Over the course of that centuries-long discussion, two\nmain distinctions emerged.\n\nThe first main distinction has to do with the nature or\nkinds of evil: is evil at bottom just an empirical\nphenomenon\u2014something that is given in the causal, phenomenal\nworld of our experience? Or is there a deeper, metaphysical\naspect to some evils? Note that this is not an exclusive distinction:\npeople who endorse the idea of metaphysical evil typically assume that\nit also has an empirical character or manifestation.\n\nSuppose, for example, we come across the sort of scene that drove\nFriedrich Nietzsche mad in Turin: a coachman mercilessly beating his\nhorse (Prideaux 2018). In this version of the case, however, suppose\nthat the coachman\u2019s cruelty is a response to his having been\nrecently diagnosed with terminal cancer. So here there is certainly\nsome empirical evil: the cancerous disruption to the body, the cruelty\nof the man, the pain of the horse. Some philosophers will say that\nthere is also metaphysical evil: neither the man nor the horse is\nmetaphysically perfect, and so on the Absence Theory considered below\n (section 3.1.1)\n both are in that respect evil. We might also regard the body and\ncharacter of the man as corrupted and conclude that he is\nmetaphysically evil in a \u201cprivative\u201d way too (see\n section 3.1.3).\n Metaphysical evils like these are distinct from the empirical evils\nof the cancer, the cruelty, and the suffering of the horse, though on\nmany accounts they are the ground of the latter.\n\nThe second main distinction has to do with the origins of\nevil, and tracks the differences between the three camps mentioned\nabove. The first option here is to say that a specific evil arises\nentirely from natural phenomena for which no one is\nresponsible. In the case of the man and his horse, it is common to\nthink that their metaphysical finitude and incapacities, as well as\nthe cancerous tumor and the canine pain, are \u201cnatural\u201d in\nthis way: they seem to be based in facts about the natures, events,\nand causal laws involved.\n\nAn alternative is to say that a specific evil has its origin in\nmoral actions and intentions. Applied to our case, it is\ncommon to think that the man\u2019s agency\u2014the choice to beat\nhis vulnerable steed\u2014is the origin of the cruelty and the pain.\nIf there is metaphysical evil here, then it too might have a moral\norigin: on some religious pictures, for instance, the corrupted human\nnature that leads to disease, cruelty, and enmity between him and\nother creatures is a result of free choice on the part of his\nprimordial ancestors. (If there is agency in any non-human\ncreatures\u2014animals or angelic\u2014then it would also fit\nhere.)\n\nThe third (and now-quite-unpopular) view about origins says that a\nspecific evil arises ultimately not from nature or from choice but\nfrom something that is both supernatural and non-agential (call this a\n\u201cspooky non-agential\u201d origin). On such views there is a\ndark force or side of reality that is the ultimate origin of, say, the\nmetaphysical evil in the man\u2019s nature. It may also be the\nultimate source of the empirical evil involved.\n\nThree further preliminary notes:\n\nThe second main distinction here is often regarded as exclusive\nwith respect to a specific evil, since we are asking about its\nultimate origin. If the man\u2019s cancer and ill-treatment\nof the horse originate entirely in the causal powers of the physical\nuniverse, then they are not also based in either free choice or\nsupernatural spookiness (and vice versa). \u201cTypically\u201d here\nis key, however, since a compatibilist picture of free will\n(O\u2019Connor & Franklin 2018 [2021]) says that free choices\nthemselves are determined by natural causes. On that view, perhaps,\nthe origin of the man\u2019s cruel act is both moral\nand natural. Compatibilisms between natural and spooky\norigins are also conceptually possible.\nAlthough some theorists think that all instances of evil\n(whether metaphysical or empirical) are grounded in just one of these\nultimate origins, most will allow that different evils have different\nultimate origins. For instance, someone might coherently think that\nthe man\u2019s cancer has a natural origin, that his cruelty has a\nmoral origin, and yet that the ferociousness of the beating has a\nspooky or \u201cdark force\u201d origin.\n Section 4\n considers some historical efforts to suggest that all evils\nare ultimately moral in origin.\nAlthough these conceptual distinctions are fairly clear, there is\nterminological variation in the historical and contemporary literature\nwith respect to the term \u201cnatural evil\u201d. Some philosophers\nand theologians use \u201cnatural evil\u201d to refer not to an\norigin but to a kind\u2014the kind that is here called\n\u201cempirical evil\u201d. When the distinctions are maintained,\nhowever, it should be clear that they are orthogonal: both\nmetaphysical evil and empirical evil can have natural, moral, or\nspooky origins (see\n Figure 1).\n\n\n\n\n\nOrigins:\nNatural\nMoral\nSpooky non-agential \n\nKinds:\n\u00a0 \n\nMetaphysical\nThe finitude, susceptibility to pain and disease, and other\nincapacities essential to the coachman and the horse and that are\nultimately based in facts about natures\nThe finitude, susceptibility to pain and disease, and the\ninclination to cruelty that are essential to the man and the result of\ndamage to his nature and/or that of his species, which damage is\nultimately based in facts about immoral acts and intentions (e.g.,\nOriginal Sin)\nThe finitude, and susceptibility to pain and disease in the\ncoachman and the horse, and the corruption in the coachman\u2019s\nnature and/or that of his species, and that are ultimately based in\nfacts about a dark force or shadow-side principle in reality\n\n\nEmpirical\nThe cancer of the coachman, whose ultimate explanation consists\nin causal facts about natural phenomena\nThe cruelty of the coachman and the suffering of the horse,\nwhose ultimate explanation consists in facts about the man\u2019s\nimmoral acts and intentions.\nThe cancer, anger, cruelty, and suffering of the coachman and\nthe horse whose ultimate explanation is based in facts about a dark\nforce or shadow-side principle in reality.  \n\n\nFigure 1.

Sections 5 through 7 look at three varieties of evil\n(systemic, symbolic, and radical) whose positions within the Table are\nmore difficult to discern.\n",
