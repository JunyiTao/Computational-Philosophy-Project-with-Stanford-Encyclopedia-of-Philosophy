    "main_text": "The Problem of Freedom\n4. The Problem of Freedom\n\nThe distinction between the normative and the factual and the question\nhow the two realms are related also structure Windelband\u2019s\nreflections on human freedom. Throughout his intellectual career,\nWindelband returns to this problem, presenting different strategies\nfor reconciling causal determinism and human freedom. His\ndissertation, completed under Lotze in 1870, deals with the concepts\nof chance, causal necessity, and freedom. At that time, Windelband\nstill embraces the Kantian concept of transcendental freedom,\naccording to which the noumenal self is the uncaused cause of all\nintentional action (1870: 16\u201319). But after the 1877 essay,\nwhich had uncovered the anti-metaphysical rejection of the\nthing-in-itself in Kant\u2019s \u201cthird phase\u201d as the\nradical starting point for the \u201cphilosophy of values\u201d,\nKant\u2019s metaphysical solution to the problem of freedom ceased to\nconvince him.\n\nWindelband\u2019s most fully developed effort to arrive at an\nalternative solution to the problem of freedom can be found in his\n1882 essay \u201cNormen und Naturgesetze\u201d [\u201cNorms and\nnatural laws\u201d] and in his 1904 lectures \u00dcber\nWillenfreiheit [On freedom of the will]. In these texts,\nWindelband articulates the following core claims. First, the Kantian\ndualism between phenomena and noumena needs to be overcome, and we\nneed to think of moral responsibility in a way that does not\npresuppose a noumenal realm. Second, causal explanation and normative\nevaluation are two irreducible, but ultimately compatible, ways of\nviewing, or constructing, the world of appearances. Third, the object\nof moral evaluation is neither a particular moral action, nor a\ntranscendentally free will, but a\n\u201cpersonality\u201d\u2014understood as a set of relatively\nstable motivations and psychological dispositions\u2014that is the\nnatural cause of our actions. Although articulating these same core\nthoughts, the two texts differ in how they motivate these ideas, and\nin the consequences that they draw from them.\n\n\u201cNormen und Naturgesetze\u201d begins by postulating a conflict\nbetween natural law and moral law: if the moral law demands an action\nthat would also result from natural causes alone, it is superfluous.\nBut if it demands an action that does not accord with natural causes,\nit is useless, because natural necessity cannot be violated (1882a:\n59).\n\nWindelband holds that causal determinism extends to mental life and\nthat for this reason the conception of freedom as a fundamental\ncapacity that violates \u201cthe naturally necessary functions of\npsychic life\u201d (1882a: 60) is implausible from the get-go.\nHowever, he grants that there are two different and irreducible ways\nof viewing the same objects: on the one hand, there is psychological\nscience which explains what the facts of mental life are. On the other\nhand, there are ideal norms, which do not explain what the facts are,\nbut express how they ought to be (1882a: 66\u201367). The solution to\nthe antagonism between natural law and moral law is to be found in the\nrelation between these two points of view.\n\nHere, Windelband introduces the claim that although ideal norms differ\nfrom causal laws, they are not incommensurable with them and, in fact,\nact on us causally. His argument builds on his conception of\n\u201cnormal consciousness\u201d as the representation of the system\nof absolute values within empirical consciousness. Windelband argues\nthat a mind that becomes aware of its own \u201cnormal\nconsciousness\u201d is capable of acting on the basis of and in\nagreement with the norms that it has discovered within itself: \n\n\n[E]ach norm carries with it a sense that the real process of thinking\nor willing ought to form itself in accordance with it. With immediate\nevidence a form of psychological coercion attaches itself to the\nawareness of the norm. (1882a: 85) \n\n\nThe norm becomes a determining factor in and for empirical\nconsciousness. It acts as \u201cpart of the causal law\u201d and\ndetermines psychological life with natural necessity (1882a: 87; see\nalso 1883: 122).\n\nThe result is what Windelband calls a \u201cdeterministic concept of\nfreedom\u201d (1882a: 88), according to which freedom consists in\nnothing other than the becoming-aware of the norms that command how we\nought to act: our becoming-aware of them determines our actions with\nnatural necessity. Freedom is the \u201cdetermination of empirical\nconsciousness by normal consciousness\u201d (1882a: 88).\n\nBut Windelband still needs to explain how it is possible that we can\nbe aware of a moral norm and not act on it. Long passages in the 1904\nlectures are devoted to developing the thought that what determines\nour moral decisions and actions, and hence decisions if and when we\nact in accordance with the moral law is our \u201cpersonality\u201d.\nWindelband approaches this as a theoretical, not as a normative,\nquestion and concludes that we may well call those decisions and\nactions \u201cfree\u201d that are predominantly determined by our\nconstant personality, as opposed to being determined by external\ncircumstances or contingent affects. Freedom is \u201cthe unhindered\ncausality of a pre-existing willing\u201d (1904b: 106).\n\nHowever, Windelband concedes that this analysis does not exhaust our\nconcept of freedom since there is not merely a theoretical, but also a\nnormative use of the concept. In this context, Windelband acknowledges\nthe attraction of the Kantian argument that moral responsibility is\npossible only if we have transcendental free will and with it the\ncapacity for genuine alternatives: we could act differently given the\nsame circumstances. But Windelband rejects the project of grounding\nhuman freedom in a noumenal world. He thinks that Kant\u2019s\ndistinction between an intelligible noumenal self that is the uncaused\ncause of our actions, and a deterministic empirical world as\nconstructed by our understanding reproduces the same problems that\nearlier metaphysical accounts of freedom had encountered. He discusses\ntwo problems in particular.\n\nFirst, on the one hand, the personality that a particular individual\nhas developed is part of the empirical world and therefore, on the\nmetaphysical picture, does not feature into the free decisions of the\nindividual. But, on the other hand, the noumenal self is empty. It is\nan abstract, general self, uniform in all of us; and thus it cannot\naccount for the differences in the moral life of individuals (1904b:\n161\u2013163).\n\nSecond, transcendental freedom is fundamentally incompatible with the\n\u201call- encompassing reality and causality of the deity\u201d\n(1904b: 187). God is the ultimate uncaused cause, and the only way to\nunderstand this thought is by assuming a \u201ctimeless\ncausality\u201d between God and the intelligible characters (noumenal\nselves)\u2014a view which ends up undermining the freedom of the\nlatter (1904b: 186\u20139)\n\nHaving concluded that Kantian dualism fails to avoid the pitfalls of\nearlier metaphysical approaches to freedom, Windelband abandons the\nconcept of transcendental freedom altogether. But while in 1882 his\nalternative had been the \u201cdeterministic concept of\nfreedom\u201d, in 1904 Windelband proceeds to articulate the view\nthat the concept of free will is a mere placeholder in our normative\ndiscourse. We are not free in the metaphysical sense, but we are\nperfectly entitled to pass moral judgment. And we use the language of\nfreedom to express the fact that when passing moral judgment we\ndisregard questions of causal determination.\n\nTo spell out this idea, Windelband takes up the 1882 distinction\nbetween the \u201cpoints of view\u201d of explanatory science and\nideal norms. He now argues that there are two ways of constructing the\nworld of appearances: we construct the world of appearances according\nto causal laws, and we construct it according to our normative\nevaluations. Evaluation \n\n\nreflects within the manifoldness of the given on those moments only\nwhich can be put in relation to the norm\u2026 [O]ne could call the\nmanner in which the objects of experience, the given manifoldness of\nthe factual, appear uniformly in light of such an evaluation another\nform of \u201cappearance\u201d\u2026. (1904b: 195\u20136) \n\n\nFreedom then means not that the will is an uncaused cause. When\nspeaking of freedom, we appeal to the uncaused merely in the sense\nthat we evaluate matters independently of causal deterministic\nprocesses (1904b: 197\u2013198).\n\nWindelband believes that his view preserves moral responsibility. As\ndescribed above, his theoretical investigation had yielded the result\nthat that which determines the extent to which we act in agreement\nwith a moral norm is our personality or character. Personality is the\nconstant cause of voluntary action, it determines our actions\nnecessarily according to general psychological laws. From a practical\nstandpoint, personality then is also the ultimate object of moral\nappraisal. We hold personality responsible, and we are justified in\ndoing so, even if the formation of personality is itself a causal\nprocess over which the individual has no control. Ultimately, the\nupshot of Windelband\u2019s discussion is that moral responsibility\ndoes not presuppose a noumenal world and transcendental freedom,\nbecause it does not presuppose that we could act otherwise. It merely\npresupposes that another person in the same circumstances could act\notherwise. The idea that one could have acted differently refers \n\n\nnot to the concrete human being in these concrete circumstances, but\nto the generic concept of the human being. (1904b: 212)\n\n",
