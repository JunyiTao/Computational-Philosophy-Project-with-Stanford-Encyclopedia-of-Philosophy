Life\n\nDamaris Masham was born in 1658, the daughter of the Cambridge\nPlatonist, Ralph Cudworth, who was Master of Christ\u2019s College,\nCambridge. Little is known of her education, but she did have the\nadvantage of being born into a family with a considerable library.\nHowever, despite the fact that her father was one of the most learned\nmen of his generation he did not teach her Latin or Greek. She did\napparently learn French as was deemed requisite for a gentlewoman of\nthe time, and she taught herself Latin, later in life, according to\nthe method recommended in Locke\u2019s Some Thoughts Concerning\nEducation.\n\nAs a young woman, Damaris Cudworth (as she then was) was able to\nescape \u2018the learned dullness\u2019 of Cambridge by visiting London\nwhere she frequented the more stimulating environment of the circle of\nElizabeth Stillingfleet, whom she nicknamed \u2018Urgunda\u2019 in her\nletters. Elizabeth Stillingfeet was the second wife of Edward\nStillingfleet, future Bishop of Worcester, who later engaged in\ncontroversy with Locke. It was probably here, that she met her\nhusband, Sir Francis Masham, who was a relative of Elizabeth\nStillingfleet.\n\nIt was also in London, sometime before 1682, that she met John Locke,\nprobably through their mutual friend, Edward Clarke. By all accounts\nLocke held her in high esteem as a philosophical mind, and she was to\nbe one of the earliest proponents of his philosophy. Their\nacquaintance, at least in the early stages, was more than merely an\nintellectual friendship. Among their earliest letters is a series of\npastoral love poems, conducted under the noms de plume,\nPhiloclea and Philander. They continued to correspond on a variety of\nphilosophical subjects during Locke\u2019s years in Holland. On his\nreturn in 1688, he became guest and later permanent resident at her\nhome at Oates in Essex.\n\nHer interest in philosophy was nurtured by her reading of the\nCambridge Platonists (Ralph Cudworth, Henry More and John Smith), with\nwhose works she was familiar by the time she met Locke. It was her\ngood fortune to make his acquaintance, since he certainly encouraged\nher interest in philosophy. Thus, unlike most women of her time,\nDamaris Cudworth had the relative advantages of a family and a\nfriendship that enabled her to develop her philosophical interests. On\nthe other hand, her marriage in 1685, to Sir Francis Masham, an Essex\nsquire and widower with nine children, was hardly one that enhanced\nher opportunities to pursue philosophy. She had one son, Francis Cudworth\nMasham. Damaris Masham\u2019s philosophical writings constitute only\na small part of her philosophical activity. Her surviving\ncorrespondence, especially with Locke and with Leibniz show that her\ninterest in philosophy went far beyond what she published. Her two\nbooks, A Discourse Concerning the Love of God (1696) and\nOccasional Thoughts in Reference to a Vertuous or Christian\nLife (1705), were printed anonymously, and with encouragement\nfrom Locke. She also wrote a biography of Locke which is the source of\nthe first printed biographies of Locke.\n\nOn the little evidence available it is impossible to establish her\nearly philosophical views with any certainty. Her published writings\ncontain clear echoes of Locke, which led to their being attributed by\nsome to Locke. Nonetheless her Cambridge Platonist background remains\nevident, especially in the religious and ethical views which connect\nboth her books which are both concerned with practical ethics. While\nthese show that she became closer to Locke in epistemology, on ethics,\nshe is closer to Cudworth, especially with regard to moral\naccountability, her acceptance that moral principles exist\nindependently as part of the nature of things, and her\nanti-voluntarism. In fact her receptivity to Locke may be attributed\nto her Cambridge Platonist background, reflecting the fact that there\nis more common ground between Locke and the Cambridge Platonists than\nis normally assumed. Areas where she is most in agreement with Locke\nentail no sacrifice of Cudworthian principles, in particular her\nholding that morality is founded in reason and the freedom to act,\nthat that the end of ethics is human happiness, and that the exercise\nof virtue requires a right disposition of mind. Like both Locke and\nthe Cambridge Platonists she was a strong advocate of religious\ntoleration.\n2. A Discourse Concerning the Love of God\n\nNotwithstanding their religious-sounding titles, both of Damaris\nMasham\u2019s books address philosophical issues which were topical\nat the time: love, happiness and moral virtue. In both she offers an\noptimistic view of human beings as rational and social creatures\nmotivated by the love of happiness. This \u201cearliest and strongest\nprinciple,\u201d consists of the enjoyment of pleasure achieved\nthrough the regulatory exercise of reason, which directs us to the\ngreatest happiness.\n\nA Discourse Concerning the Love of God (1696) was written in\nexplicit critique of John Norris, the most important English proponent\nof the philosophy of Nicholas Malebranche. Norris had, in 1690,\nattacked Locke in Cursory Reflections upon a Book Call\u2019d\nEssay Concerning Human Understanding. This may in part explain\nMasham\u2019s hostility to Norris, in spite of the fact that she was\ndedicatee of another book by him: Reflections on the Conduct of\nHuman Life (London, 1690). However, the immediate context for\nA Discourse was the debate about the nature of love, which\nwas a theme in Norris\u2019s writings, especially his Practical\nDiscourses (1691, to which she makes direct reference), and his\ncorrespondence with Mary Astell published as Letters Concerning\nthe Love of God (1695). Lady Masham\u2019s critique of Norris\nand Astell is also aimed, indirectly, at Nicolas Malebranche. Further\nin the background to it was the so-called  Querelle du\nQuietisme, the debate on amour pur [pure love] between\nMalebranche, Fran\u00e7ois de F\u00e9nelon and\nJacques-B\u00e9nigne Bossuet which was sparked by the mystical\nwritings of Madame Guyon.\n\nNorris had taken an occasionalist position, maintaining that God is\nthe immediate cause of pleasure for us and is therefore the sole and\nproper object of our love. Creatures are therefore merely the\noccasional causes of pleasing effects in us, and our love of creatures\nis inferior and secondary to our love of God. Accordingly he\ndistinguishes two kinds of love: love of God or benevolence and love\nof creatures or concupiscence, claiming that desire only pertains to\nthe love of God. In response Lady Masham denies Norris\u2019s\ndistinction between love of God and love of creatures, insisting that\ndesire pertains to our love of created things. She argues that our\nlove of God comes not from a divinely instilled idea of God in our\nminds, but from observing the world around us, whence we conclude,\nrationally, that we owe love to its creator, God. Her fundamental\nobjection to Norris\u2019s occasionalism is that it undermines the\nbasis of morality because, by denigrating God\u2019s works, it\ndestroys the bonds of human society and the very basis of Christian\nmorality. In opposition to Norris, Lady Masham emphasises the\nimportance of practical morality, arguing that it is integral to\nreligious conduct.\n\nHer affinity with Locke is most apparent in her epistemology. For\ninstance she argues that we derive our knowledge of God by comparing\nideas \u201creceived from Sense and Reflection\u201d and that the\nidea of God is \u201ca Proposition containing many complex Ideas in\nit; and which we are not capable of framing till we have been long\nacquainted with pleasing Sensations\u201d (A Discourse, p.\n66). She also defines love in a Lockean manner as\n\u201ccomplaisance\u201d. A French translation of A\nDiscourse by Pierre Coste was published in Amsterdam in 1705, and\nreviewed in Jean Le Clerc\u2019s Bibliotheque Choisie in the\nsame year. \n3. Occasional Thoughts\n\nOccasional Thoughts in Reference to a Vertuous or Christian\nLife (1705) develops Lady Masham\u2019s views on practical\nmorality that she had set out in A Discourse. The book is\nalso, in part, an answer to Mary Astell\u2019s The Christian\nReligion as Professed by a Daughter of the Church which was\npublished as a reply to A Discourse Concerning the Love of\nGod. In a discussion of the role of reason in religious matters\nand the relationship between religion and virtuous conduct, Lady\nMasham sets out to defend reasonable Christianity from Deism on the\none hand and superstition on the other. Against the Deists, Masham\ninsists on the importance of revelation and faith and denies that\nnatural religion based purely on reason is possible. On the other hand\nreligious belief that ignores the role of reason in religion is mere\nsuperstition and will result in bigotry and atheism, because \u201can\nIrrational Religion can never Rationally be conceived to come from\nGod\u201d (Occasional Thoughts, p. 36). (In Masham\u2019s\nview, Roman Catholicism, with its stress on the externals of religion\nis largely superstition). For her part, Lady Masham emphasises the\nmoral aspect of religion, its practical application, rather than\ndoctrinal content. She shares Locke\u2019s view that virtuous living\nis more important than religious ceremonial. Like Locke in the\nEpistola de tolerantia, she argues that moral conduct is\ncentral to religious practice. Accordingly she argues that morality\nand religion should not be separated in religious instruction.\nFurthermore, civil and religious liberties are necessary for the\nexercise of virtue. \n\nIn developing her arguments about practical morality she argues that\nthe exercise of virtue is grounded in civil and religious liberty.\n\u201cFreedom or Liberty of action\u201d, she insists, is \u201cthe\ngreatest endowment that a Created Being is capable of\nheeding\u201d(Occasional Thoughts, pp. 68\u201378). Education is\nthe key means to inculcate virtue. And virtue is to be learned not\nthrough precept but by developing a rational understanding of moral\nprinciples. Lack of education and poor education are destructive\nsocially, morally and spiritually, a point which she develops into a\nfeminist argument for the education of women. This centres on the\ntraditional role of mothers in the moral education of their children.\nHighly critical of the limited and distorted education which girls\nreceive, she argues that a mother cannot give her children a\nmeaningful moral education if she herself is denied education.\n4. Correspondence\n\nDamaris Masham\u2019s correspondence is important for the insight it\ngives into her philosophical interests. It is not a perfect source, as\nit is far from complete. She herself preferred what she called\n\u201crationall conversation\u201d as a medium for philosophical\ndiscussion. After Locke\u2019s arrival at Oates, she was able to\nengage in person with visitors from Locke\u2019s otherwise male\nsocial world of friends and associates, such as his nephew Peter King,\nAnthony Collins, John Shute (later Viscount Barrington), Francis\nMercury van Helmont, Samuel Bolde, Lord Shaftesbury, Lord Peterborough\nand Isaac Newton. Among these, Pierre Coste was engaged as tutor to\nher son.  Prior to this, letter-writing enabled her to engage with\nothers beyond her domestic environment. Letters also mitigated her\nisolation from company at Oates after her marriage. Subsequently, the\nreview of her Discourse in Jean Le\nClerc\u2019s Bibliotheque Choisie, was confirmation that she\nacquired a place of sorts in the international intellectual network\nknown as the \u2018Republic of Letters\u2019, which was centred on\nHuguenot diaspora in the Netherlands. Her international correspondents\nfrom this network besides Jean Le Clerc included Philip van Limborch\nand Gottfried Wilhelm Leibniz.\n\nDamaris Masham\u2019s extant correspondence indicates a lively interest\nin a range of topics, such as friendship and religious toleration. The\nmost philosophically important letters were those she exchanged with\nLocke and Leibniz. \n\nThe correspondence with Locke, conducted between 1682 and Locke\u2019s\ntaking up residence at Oates, is the largest extant group of letters\n(some 45 letters survive). Most of Locke\u2019s letters to her have\nbeen lost and many of the letters are of a personal nature. But themes\ninclude proof of the existence of God and the role of reason in\nmatters of religion. Early on she defends the epistemology of the\nCambridge Platonist, John Smith, arguing that there is a\nsupra-rational/elevated form of knowledge accessible by a\n\u2018Higher Principle\u2019 than reason, which may nonetheless be\nactivated with the help of reason. Locke however, dismissed this as a\nform of \u2018Enthusiasm\u2019. Later she commented on the Epitome of\nLocke\u2019s Essay which he sent her in 1688. \n\nBetween 1704 and 1705\u20136, Lady Masham corresponded with Leibniz, at his\ninstigation, perhaps because he hoped thereby, to have contact with\nLocke. This gave her the opportunity to discuss Leibniz\u2019s philosophy\nwith him, and for Leibniz to discuss the philosophy of her father,\nRalph Cudworth. Lady Masham knew Leibniz\u2019s philosophy only\nindirectly from the Journal des S\u00e7avans of 1695, and\nBayle\u2019s article \u201cRorarius\u201d in the first edition of\nhis Dictionnaire. She takes issue with Leibniz on a number of\npoints, including his theory of pre-established harmony, the nature of\nsubstance and free will.\n\nHer correspondence with Jean Le Clerc gives some insight into her\nviews on religious toleration. It also includes her defence of her\nfather\u2019s True Intellectual System of the Universe\nagainst the critique of Cudworth by Pierre Bayle, a controversy which\nwas conducted by proxy through Jean Le Clerc. This is revealing in a\nnumber of ways. It shows she was willing to disagree with Cudworth (e.g., on\nthe question of whether there could be such a thing as unextended\nsubstance), whilst retaining her respect for him and being prepared to\ndefend him against his detractors (in this case Pierre Bayle). It also\nindicates that she had not abandoned all the Platonist tenets to which\nshe subscribed before she met Locke.\n\n", "bibliography": {"categories": ["<a name=\"Sou\">Sources</a>", "<a name=\"Stu\">Studies</a>"], "cat_ref_text": {"<a name=\"Sou\">Sources</a>": ["</h3>\n<ul class=\"hanging\">", "Astell, Mary, 1705, <em>The Christian Religion as Professed by a\nDaughter of the Church</em>, London: R.
