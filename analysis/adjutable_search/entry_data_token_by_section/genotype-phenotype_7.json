    "main_text": "From Mendelian Research and Models to the Present: Advances, Ambiguities and Persisting Questions || Continuous Variation\n3.3 Continuous Variation\n\nNot all aspects of the study of heredity could be made an experimental\nendeavor through Mendelian methods. There were many traits for which\nthe continuous variation could not be subdivided into discrete\nphenotypes, let alone linked to genotypes, especially for traits in\nagriculture of economic interest such as yield of plant and animal\nvarieties or breeds. By the end of the 1910s Ronald Fisher and Sewall\nWright had begun to address the need to reconcile the discreteness of\ngenotypes with continuous variation in many observable traits. In the\nmathematical models of a field that came to be known as\nquantitative genetics, differences between unobserved\ntheoretical genotypes (in the sense of pairs of genes) at each of a\nlarge number of loci contribute to differences in the trait, modulated\nby degrees of correspondingly theoretical dominance and epistasis.\nUnder the reasonable assumption that more of the genes are shared\namong relatives than in the population as a whole, data on a given\ntrait as it varies across genealogically defined lines or groups of\nspecified relatedness could be analyzed so as to provide predictions\nof changes in the average value of the trait in the population under\nselective breeding. Of course, the trait values and thus the\npredictions depended on the conditions in which the organisms\ndeveloped, but in the laboratory and, to varying degrees, in\nagricultural breeding, conditions could be replicated. For the\nbreeder, the focus of the quantitative genetic data analysis on\ndifferences in the trait makes practical sense; it is not necessary to\nknow the mechanisms through which the traits developed as organisms\nreacted to conditions. In other words, the meanings of genotype,\nphenotype, and their distinction again make sense as an abstraction\nthrough practices of control over biological materials and conditions\nin agricultural and laboratory breeding and the allied use of models\nand analysis of data.\n\nIt should also be noted that, in agricultural breeding, the lines or\nother genealogically defined groups became called genotypes as well.\nGenotypes in this sense are classes of individuals related by\ngenealogy from a common ancestor or set of ancestors. The relatedness\ntakes a variety of forms\u2014not only pure (inbred or cloned) lines,\nbut also offspring of a given pair of parents or a set of ancestors or\nan open pollinated plant variety in which the genes vary within\nreplicable bounds among the generations of individuals in the class.\nThe corresponding phenotype is then the range of values of the trait\nor set of traits as they are observed to vary for the genealogically\ndefined line or group in the given location(s) or situation(s). In\nthis sense the phenotypes from different lines may overlap; organisms\nare divisible into phenotypes as classes for the purpose of\nquantitative genetic analysis not through \u201cfiner methods of\nmeasuring or description\u201d, but because the lines or groups are\nseparable. (Quantitative genetics extended to humans does not involve\ncontrolled breeding, but does rely on relatedness that differs\nbetween, say, monozygotic and dizygotic (i.e., fraternal) twins. Even\nthough a twin pair is not conventionally referred to as a genotype,\nhuman quantitative genetics has followed the same idea for data\nanalysis as used in agricultural breeding.)\n",
