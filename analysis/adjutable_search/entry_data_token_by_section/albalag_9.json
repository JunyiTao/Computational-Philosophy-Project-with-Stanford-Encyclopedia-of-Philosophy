    "main_text": "God-world Relationship || The Problem of Determinism\n5.4 The Problem of Determinism\n\nIn the Maq\u0101\u1e63id, al-Ghazali restates the basic\nelements of Avicenna\u2019s deterministic metaphysics and its\nimplication for the nature and domain of divine knowledge. He\nexplains, in light of Avicenna\u2019s conception of being, the manner\nin which God knows future events. Possible things are necessitated by\ntheir causes; when a cause exists, the effect must necessarily follow.\nAs such, knowledge of a cause allows one to predict, beyond doubt, the\noccurrence of the associated effect or event. Inasmuch as God has\ncomplete knowledge of the hierarchy of the causes, He has knowledge of\nall future events (Maq\u0101\u1e63id: 118; cf. Avicenna \nal-Naj\u0101t: 587\u2013599)\n\nFor Albalag, this deterministic worldview on which al-Ghazali\u2019s\naccount of God\u2019s knowledge of future events dwells follows from\na narrow understanding of the cause-effect relationship. Possible\nthings, according to Albalag, are realized by either material or\nefficient causes, or both. Some of these causes are either volitional\nor natural. Volitional causes, \u201chinge solely on the power of the\nchooser\u201d, which means that effects are not necessary and cannot\nbe predicted. Effects arising from natural causes are necessary, only\nwhen the natural causes are necessary, that is, when they maintain a\nfixed order and cannot be hindered by other accidental or voluntary\ncauses. An example of this is a solar eclipse. Foreknowledge of this\nevent and ones like it are correspondingly necessary with respect to\nthe knower. By contrast, some natural causes, despite having an\norder, can be impeded by voluntary or accidental causes. In such\ncases, the effects are not necessary, and hence it is not possible to\nmake certain predictions about their occurrence. \n\n\nI maintain that for any possible thing, if all its proximate an remote\ncauses succeed each other essentially and maintain order in their\nactions, and no hindrance can prevent any of them, then it is to be\njudged the same as a necessary thing with respect to knower. However,\nregarding other possible things one cannot know with certain knowledge\nthe fact or the time of their occurrence before their occurrence.\n(quotation from Manekin 2007: 141)\n\n\nAlbalag is aware that this note entails a denial of God\u2019s\nknowledge of every future event. For this reason, he clarifies that\nhis intention is not to propose that God is ignorant of future events,\nfor, indeed, he thinks that God knows them, but in a manner that is\ndifferent from human knowledge.\n\nAlthough Albalag is critical, overall, of al-Ghazali\u2019s account\nof God\u2019s foreknowledge, he recommends teaching it to the\nmultitude because it is easy for them to comprehend. Albalag still\npoints to the theological implication associated with it. \n\n\nWhen you examine al-Ghazali\u2019s statements carefully you will find\nthat they entail the annulment of man\u2019s choice and the\nconclusion that his actions are compelled, as well as the annulment of\nthe nature of the possible altogether. These opinions not only\nconstitute repudiation of philosophy but also heresy with respect the\nTorah. (Quotation from Manekin 2007: 142)\n\n",
