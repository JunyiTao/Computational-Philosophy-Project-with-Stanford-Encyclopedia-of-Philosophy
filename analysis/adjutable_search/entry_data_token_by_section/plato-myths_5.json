Myth and philosophy\n\nIn the Protagoras (324d) a distinction is made between\nmuthos and logos, where muthos appears to\nrefer to a story and logos to an argument. This distinction\nseems to be echoed in the Theaetetus and the\nSophist. In the Theaetetus Socrates discusses\nProtagoras\u2019 main doctrine and refers to it as \u201cthe\nmuthos of Protagoras\u201d (164d9) (in the same line\nSocrates also calls Theaetetus\u2019 defence of the identity of\nknowledge and perception a muthos). And later on, at 156c4,\nSocrates calls a muthos the teaching according to which\nactive and passive motions generate perception and perceived objects.\nIn the Sophist, the Visitor from Elea tells his interlocutors\nthat Xenophanes, Parmenides and other Eleatic, Ionian (Heraclitus\nincluded) and Sicilian philosophers \u201cappear to me to tell us a\nmyth, as if we were children\u201d (242c8; see also c\u2013e). By\ncalling all those philosophical doctrines muthoi Plato does\nnot claim that they are myths proper, but that they are, or appear to\nbe, non-argumentative. In the Republic Plato is fairly\nhostile to particular traditional myths (but he claims that there are\ntwo kinds of logoi, one true and the other false, and that\nthe muthoi we tell children \u201care false, on the whole,\nthough they have some truth in them\u201d, 377a; for a discussion of\nallegory and myth in Plato\u2019s Republic see Lear (2006)).\nHalliwell (2011) claims that Book X of the Republic\n\u201coffers not a simple repudiation of the best poets but a\ncomplicated counterpoint in which resistance and attraction to their\nwork are intertwined, a counterpoint which (among other things)\nexplores the problem of whether, and in what sense, it might be\npossible to be a \u2018philosophical lover\u2019 of poetry\u201d\n(244). For an illuminating article on the Republic and the\nOdyssey see Segal (1978); see also Howland (2006).\n\nIn many dialogues he condemns the use of images in knowing things and\nclaims that true philosophical knowledge should avoid images. He would\nhave had strong reasons for avoiding the use of myths: they are not\nargumentative and they are extremely visual (especially those he\ninvented, which contain so many visual details as if he would have\ngiven instructions to an illustrator). But he didn\u2019t. He wanted\nto persuade and/or teach a wider audience, so he had to make a\ncompromise. Sometimes, however, he seems to interweave philosophy with\nmyth to a degree that was not required by persuading and/or teaching a\nnon-philosophical audience. The eschatological myths of the\nGorgias, Phaedo and Republic, for instance,\nare tightly bound with the philosophical arguments of those dialogues\n(cf. Annas 1982); and the eschatological myth of the Phaedo\n\u201cpicks one by one the programmatic remarks about teleological\nscience from earlier on in the dialogue, and sketches ways in which\ntheir proposals can be fulfilled\u201d (Sedley 1990, 381). Some other\ntimes he uses myth as a supplement to philosophical discourse (cf.\nKahn (2009) who argues that in the myth of the Statesman\nPlato makes a doctrinal contribution to his political philosophy; Naas\n(2018a, Chapter 2) offers an interesting interpretation of this myth,\nand (Chapter 3) discusses Michel Foucault\u2019s reading of it. A\nnumber of chapters in Sallis (2017) and in Bossi and Robinson (2018)\nreassess the myth of the Statesman. One time, in the\nTimaeus, Plato appears to overcome the opposition between\nmuthos and logos: human reason has limits, and when\nit reaches them it has to rely on myth (arguably, that also happen in\nthe Symposium; for a very close reading of how\nDiotima\u2019s speech interacts with Aristophanes\u2019 myth of the\nandrogyne see Hyland (2015).\n\n\u201cOn the less radical version, the idea will be that the telling\nof stories is a necessary adjunct to, or extension of, philosophical\nargument, one which recognizes our human limitations,\nand\u2014perhaps\u2014the fact that our natures combine irrational\nelements with the rational\u201d (Rowe 1999, 265). On a more radical\ninterpretation, \u201cthe distinction between \u2018the\nphilosophical\u2019 and \u2018the mythical\u2019 will\u2014at one\nlevel\u2014virtually disappear\u201d (265). If we take into account\nthat Plato chose to express his thoughts through a narrative form,\nnamely that of the dialogue (further enveloped in fictional mises\nen sc\u00e8ne), we may say that the \u201cuse of a fictional\nnarrative form (the dialogue) will mean that any conclusions reached,\nby whatever method (including \u2018rational argument\u2019), may\nthemselves be treated as having the status of a kind of\n\u2018myth\u2019\u201d (265). If so, \u201ca sense of the\n\u2018fictionality\u2019 of human utterance, as provisional,\ninadequate, and at best approximating to the truth, will infect\nPlatonic writing at its deepest level, below other and more ordinary\napplications of the distinction between mythical and nonmythical forms\nof discourse\u201d (265); if so, it is not only \u201cthat\n\u2018myth\u2019 will fill in the gaps that reason leaves (though it\nmight do that too, as well as serving special purposes for particular\naudiences), but that human reason itself ineradicably displays some of\nthe features we characteristically associate with story-telling\u201d\n(265\u20136) (cf. also Fowler (2011, 64): \u201cJust as the\nimmortal, purely rational soul is tainted by the irrational body, so\nlogos is tainted by mythos\u201d). It is difficult\nto say which one of these two readings is a better approximation of\nwhat Plato thought about the interplay between myth and philosophy.\nThe interpreter seems bound to furnish only probable accounts about\nthis matter.\n\nFowler (2011) surveys the muthos\u2013logos dichotomy from\nHerodotus and the pre\u2013Socratic philosophers to Plato, the\nSophists, and the Hellenistic and Imperial writers, and provides many\nvaluable references to works dealing with the notion of\nmuthos, the Archaic uses of myth\u2013 words, and\nancient Greek mythology; see also Wians (2009). For the\nmuthos\u2013logos dichotomy in Plato see also Miller (2011,\n76\u201377).\n",
