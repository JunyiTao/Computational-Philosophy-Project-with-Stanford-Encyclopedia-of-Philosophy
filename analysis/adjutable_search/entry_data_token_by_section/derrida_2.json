Basic Argumentation and its Implications: Time, Hearing-Oneself-Speak, the Secret, and Sovereignty\n\nAlready we are very close to Derrida\u2019s basic argumentation. The\nbasic argumentation always attempts to show that no one is able to\nseparate irreplaceable singularity and machine-like repeatability (or\n\u201citerability,\u201d as Derrida frequently says) into two\nsubstances that stand outside of one another; nor is anyone able to\nreduce one to the other so that we would have one pure substance (with\nattributes or modifications). Machine-like repeatability and\nirreplaceable singularity, for Derrida, are like two forces that\nattract one another across a limit that is indeterminate and\ndivisible. Yet, to understand the basic argumentation, we must be, as\nDerrida himself says in Rogues, \u201cresponsible guardians\nof the heritage of transcendental idealism\u201d (Rogues, p.\n134; see also Limited Inc, p. 93). Kant had of course opened\nup the possibility of this way of philosophizing: arguing back (Kant\ncalled this arguing back a \u201cdeduction\u201d) from the givenness\nof experience to the conditions that are necessarily required for the\nway experience is given. These conditions would function as a\nfoundation for all experience. Following Kant (but also Husserl and\nHeidegger), Derrida then is always interested in necessary and\nfoundational conditions of experience.\n\nSo, let us start with the simplest argument that we can formulate. If\nwe reflect on experience in general, what we cannot deny is that\nexperience is conditioned by time. Every experience, necessarily,\ntakes place in the present. In the present experience, there is the\nkernel or point of the now. What is happening right now is a kind of\nevent, different from every other now I have ever experienced. Yet,\nalso in the present, I remember the recent past and I anticipate what\nis about to happen. The memory and the anticipation consist in\nrepeatability. Because what I experience now can be immediately\nrecalled, it is repeatable and that repeatability therefore motivates\nme to anticipate the same thing happening again. Therefore, what is\nhappening right now is also not different from every other\nnow I have ever experienced. At the same time, the present\nexperience is an event and it is not an event because it is\nrepeatable. This \u201cat the same time\u201d is the crux of the\nmatter for Derrida. The conclusion is that we can have no experience\nthat does not essentially and inseparably contain these two agencies\nof event and repeatability.\n\nThis basic argument contains four important implications.\nFirst, experience as the experience of the present is never a\nsimple experience of something present over and against me, right\nbefore my eyes as in an intuition; there is always another agency\nthere. Repeatability contains what has passed away and is no longer\npresent and what is about to come and is not yet present. The\npresent therefore is always complicated by non-presence. Derrida calls\nthis minimal repeatability found in every experience \u201cthe\ntrace.\u201d Indeed, the trace is a kind of proto-linguisticality\n(Derrida also calls it \u201carche-writing\u201d), since language in\nits most minimal determination consists in repeatable forms.\nSecond, the argument has disturbed the traditional structure\nof transcendental philosophy, which consists in a linear relation\nbetween foundational conditions and founded experience. In traditional\ntranscendental philosophy (as in Kant for example), an empirical event\nsuch as what is happening right now is supposed to be\nderivative from or founded upon conditions which are not\nempirical. Yet, Derrida\u2019s basic argument demonstrates that the\nempirical event is a non-separable part of the structural or\nfoundational conditions. Or, in traditional transcendental philosophy,\nthe empirical event is supposed to be an accident that overcomes an\nessential structure. But with Derrida\u2019s argument, we see that\nthis accident cannot be removed or eliminated. We can describe this\nsecond implication in still another way. In traditional philosophy we\nalways speak of a kind of first principle or origin and that origin is\nalways conceived as self-identical (again something like a Garden of\nEden principle). Yet, here we see that the origin is immediately\ndivided, as if the \u201cfall\u201d into division, accidents, and\nempirical events has always already taken place. In Of\nSpirit, Derrida calls this kind of origin\n\u201corigin-heterogeneous\u201d: the origin is heterogeneous\nimmediately (Of Spirit, pp. 107\u2013108). Third,\nif the origin is always heterogeneous, then nothing is ever given\nas such in certainty. Whatever is given is given as other\nthan itself, as already past or as still to come. What becomes\nfoundational therefore in Derrida is this \u201cas\u201d: origin as\nthe heterogeneous \u201cas.\u201d The \u201cas\u201d means that\nthere is no knowledge as such, there is no truth as such, there is no\nperception, no intuition of anything as such. Faith, perjury, and\nlanguage are already there in the origin. Fourth, if\nsomething like a fall has always already taken place, has taken place\nessentially or necessarily, then every experience contains an aspect\nof lateness. It seems as though I am always late for the origin since\nit seems to have always already disappeared. Every experience then is\nalways not quite on time or, as Derrida quotes Hamlet, time is\n\u201cout of joint.\u201d Late in his career, Derrida will call this\ntime being out of joint \u201canachronism\u201d (see for instance\nOn the Name, p. 94). As we shall see in a moment, anachronism\nfor Derrida is the flip side of what he calls \u201cspacing\u201d\n(espacement); space is out of place. But we should also keep\nin mind, as we move forward that the phrase \u201cout of joint\u201d\nalludes to justice: being out of joint, time is necessarily unjust or\nviolent.\n\nSo far, we can say that the argument is quite simple although it has\nwide-ranging implications. It is based on an analysis of experience,\nbut it is also based in the experience of what Derrida has called\n\u201cauto-affection.\u201d We find the idea of auto-affection (or\nself-affection) in ancient Greek philosophy, for example in\nAristotle\u2019s definition of God as \u201cthought thinking\nitself.\u201d Auto-affection occurs when I affect myself, when the\naffecting is the same as the affected. As we said above, Derrida will\nfrequently write about autobiography as a form of auto-affection or\nself-relation. In the very late The Animal that Therefore I\nam, Derrida tells us what he is trying to do with auto-affection:\n\u201cif the auto-position, the automonstrative autotely of\nthe \u2018I,\u2019 even in the human, implies the \u2018I\u2019 to\nbe an other that must welcome within itself some irreducible\nhetero-affection (as I [that is, Derrida] have tried to demonstrate\nelsewhere [my emphasis]), then this autonomy of the\n\u2018I\u2019 can be neither pure nor rigorous; it would not be able\nto form the basis for a simple and linear differentiation of the human\nfrom the animal\u201d (The Animal that Therefore I am, p.\n95). Always, Derrida tries to show that auto-affection is\nhetero-affection; the experience of the same (I am thinking about\nmyself) is the experience of the other (insofar as I think about\nmyself I am thinking of someone or something else at the same time).\nBut, in order to understand more fully the basic argumentation, let us\nlook at three of these \u201cother places\u201d where Derrida has\n\u201cattempted\u201d to show that an irreducible hetero-affection\ninfects auto-affection.\n\nThe first occurs in Voice and Phenomenon, Derrida\u2019s\n1967 study of Husserl. While this is a small book, it aims to\ncriticize what Husserl calls the \u201cprinciple of all\nprinciples\u201d for phenomenology, that is, that evidentness is\nbased in an intuition, intuition being different from a sign (Husserl\n2014, 43\u201344, paragraph 24). In Voice and Phenomenon\nDerrida recognizes that perception, for Husserl, is that of\nadumbrations, with an intentional meaning unifying the different\nprofiles. However, Derrida sees in the principle of all principles and\nin Husserl\u2019s introduction of an Idea in the Kantian sense\n(Husserl 2014, 284\u2013285, paragraph 143) the imposition of a telos\nfor perception towards a pure intuition, pure presence or givenness,\nuncontaminated by signification.\n\nMore specifically, Derrida argues that, when Husserl describes\nlived-experience (Erlebnis), even absolute subjectivity, he\nis speaking of an interior monologue, auto-affection as\nhearing-oneself-speak. According to Derrida, hearing-oneself-speak is,\nfor Husserl, \u201can auto-affection of an absolutely unique\ntype\u201d (Voice and Phenomenon, p. 67). It is unique\nbecause there seems to be no external detour from the hearing to the\nspeaking; in hearing-oneself-speak there is self-proximity. It seems\ntherefore that I hear myself speak immediately in the very\nmoment that I am speaking. According to Derrida,\nHusserl\u2019s own description of temporalization however undermines\nthe idea that I hear myself speak immediately. On the one hand,\nHusserl describes what he calls the \u201cliving present,\u201d the\npresent that I am experiencing right now, and yet Husserl also says\nthat the living present is thick. The living present is thick because\nit includes phases other than the now, in particular, what Husserl\ncalls \u201cprotention,\u201d the anticipation (or\n\u201cawaiting,\u201d we might say) of the approaching future and\n\u201cretention,\u201d the memory of the recent past. As is well\nknown, Derrida focuses on the status of retention in Voice and\nPhenomenon. Retention in Husserl has a strange status since\nHusserl wants to include it in the present as a kind of perception and\nat the same time he recognizes that it is different from the present\nas a kind of non-perception. For Derrida, Husserl\u2019s descriptions\nimply that the living present, by always folding the recent past back\ninto itself, by always folding primary memory into the present\nperception, involves a difference in the very middle of it\n(Voice and Phenomenon, p. 56). In other words, in the very\nmoment, when silently I speak to myself, it must be the case that\nthere is a minuscule hiatus differentiating me into the speaker and\ninto the hearer. There must be a hiatus that differentiates me from\nmyself, a hiatus or gap without which I would not be a hearer as\nwell as a speaker. This hiatus also defines the trace, a minimal\nrepeatability. And this hiatus, this fold of repetition, is found in\nthe very moment of hearing-myself-speak. Derrida stresses that\n\u201cmoment\u201d or \u201cinstant\u201d translates the German\n\u201cAugenblick,\u201d which literally means \u201cblink of the\neye.\u201d When Derrida stresses the literal meaning of\n\u201cAugenblick,\u201d he is in effect \u201cdeconstructing\u201d\nauditory auto-affection into visual auto-affection. When I look in the\nmirror, for example, it is necessary that I am \u201cdistanced\u201d\nor \u201cspaced\u201d from the mirror. I must be distanced from\nmyself so that I am able to be both seer and seen.\nThe space between, however, remains obstinately invisible.\nRemaining invisible, the space gouges out the eye, blinds it. I see\nmyself over there in the mirror and yet, that self over there is other\nthan me; so, I am not able to see myself as such. What Derrida is\ntrying to demonstrate here is that this \u201cspacing\u201d\n(espacement) or blindness is essentially necessary for all\nforms of auto-affection, even tactile auto-affection which seems to be\nimmediate.\n\nNow, let us go to another \u201cother place,\u201d which can be\nfound in \u201cHow to Avoid Speaking.\u201d Here Derrida discusses\nnegative theology by means of the idea of\n\u201cd\u00e9n\u00e9gation,\u201d \u201cdenegation\u201d or\n\u201cdenial.\u201d The French word\n\u201cd\u00e9n\u00e9gation\u201d translates Freud\u2019s term\n\u201cVerneinung.\u201d Both words\u2019 prefixes imply an emphasis\nof negation (although the French prefix also implies a negation of a\nnegation). Yet, within psychoanalysis and in particular in Freud, the\nterm ,\u201cVerneinung\u201d implies that when the patient denies a\ndesire or wish, he or she has indicated to the analyst precisely what\nhe or she unconsciously desires or wishes. The denial then functions\nas a sort of disguised confirmation of the analyst\u2019s\ninterpretation of the patient\u2019s symptoms or problem. In short,\nand this is what Derrida is most interested in, psychoanalysis has\nisolated a negation which is in fact an affirmation. The fundamental\nquestion then for negative theology, but also for psychoanalysis, and\nfor Derrida is how to deny and yet also not deny. This\nduality between not telling and telling is why Derrida takes up the\nidea of the secret. In \u201cHow to Avoid Speaking,\u201d Derrida\nsays, and this is an important comment for understanding the secret in\nDerrida: \u201cThere is a secret of denial\n[d\u00e9n\u00e9gation] and a denial\n[d\u00e9n\u00e9gation] of the secret. The secret as\nsuch, as secret, separates and already institutes a negativity;\nit is a negation that denies itself. It de-negates itself\u201d\n(Languages of the Unsayable, p. 25, my emphasis). Here\nDerrida speaks of a secret as such. A secret as such is\nsomething that must not be spoken; we then have the first negation:\n\u201cI promise not to give the secret away.\u201d And yet,\nin order to possess a secret really, to have it\nreally, I must tell it to myself. Here we can see the\nrelation of hearing-oneself-speak that we just saw in Voice and\nPhenomenon. Keeping a secret includes necessarily auto-affection:\nI must speak to myself of the secret. We might however say more, we\nmight even say that I am too weak for this speaking of the secret to\nmyself not to happen. I must have a conceptual grasp of it; I have to\nframe a representation of the secret. With the idea of a\nre-presentation (I must present the secret to myself again in\norder to possess it really), we also see retention, repetition, and\nthe trace or a name. A trace of the secret must be formed, in which\ncase, the secret is in principle shareable. If the secret must be\nnecessarily shareable, it is always already shared. In other words, in\norder to frame the representation of the secret, I must negate the\nfirst negation, in which I promised not to tell the secret: I must\ntell the secret to myself as if I were someone else. I thereby make a\nsecond negation, a so to speak \u201cde-\u201d or\n\u201cun-negation,\u201d which means I must break the promise not to\ntell the secret. In order to keep the secret (or the promise), I must\nnecessarily not keep the secret (I must violate the promise). So, I\npossess the secret and do not possess it. This structure has the\nconsequence of there being no secret as such. A secret is\nnecessarily shared. As Derrida says in \u201cHow to Avoid\nSpeaking,\u201d\n\nThis denial [d\u00e9n\u00e9gation] does not happen [to\nthe secret] by accident; it is essential and originary. \u2026 The\nenigma \u2026 is the sharing of the secret, and not only shared to\nmy partner in the society but the secret shared within itself, its\n\u2018own\u2019 partition, which divides the essence of a secret\nthat cannot even appear to one alone except in starting to be lost, to\ndivulge itself, hence to dissimulate itself, as secret, in showing\nitself: dissimulating its dissimulation. There is no secret as such; I\ndeny it. And this is what I confide in secret to whomever allies\nhimself to me. This is the secret of the alliance. (Languages of\nthe Unsayable, p. 25)\n\n\nNow, finally, let us go to one of the most recent of Derrida\u2019s\nwritings, to his 2002 \u201cThe Reason of the Strongest,\u201d the\nfirst essay in the book called Rogues. There Derrida is\ndiscussing the United Nations, which he says combines the two\nprinciples of Western political thought: sovereignty and democracy.\nBut, \u201cdemocracy and sovereignty are at the same time, but also\nby turns, inseparable and in contradiction with one another\u201d\n(Rogues, p. 100). Democracy and sovereignty contradict one\nanother in the following way. And here Derrida is speaking of pure\nsovereignty, the very \u201cessence of sovereignty\u201d\n(Rogues, p. 100). On the one hand, in order to be sovereign,\none must wield power oneself, take responsibility for its use by\noneself, which means that the use of power, if it is to be sovereign,\nmust be silent; the sovereign does not have to give reasons; the\nsovereign must exercise power in secret. In other words, sovereignty\nattempts to possess power indivisibly, it tries not to share,\nand not sharing means contracting power into an instant\u2014the\ninstant of action, of an event, of a singularity. We can see the\noutline here of Derrida\u2019s deconstruction not only of the\nhearing-oneself-speak auto-affection but also of the auto-affection of\nthe promising-to-oneself to keep a secret. On the other hand,\ndemocracy calls for the sovereign to share power, to give reasons, to\nuniversalize. In democracy the use of power therefore is always an\nabuse of power (see Haddad 2013, pp. 51\u201365). Derrida can also\nsay that sovereignty and democracy are inseparable from one another\n(the contradiction makes them heterogeneous to one another) because\ndemocracy even though it calls for universalization (giving reasons in\nan assembly) also requires force, freedom, a decision, sovereign\npower. For Derrida, in democracy, a decision (the use of power) is\nalways urgent; and yet (here is the contradiction), democracy takes\ntime, democracy makes one wait so that the use of power can be\ndiscussed. Power can never be exercised without its communication; as\nDerrida says, \u201cAs soon as I speak to the other, I submit to the\nlaw of giving reason(s), I share a virtually universalizable medium, I\ndivide my authority\u201d (Rogues, p. 101). There must be\nsovereignty, and yet, there can be no use of power without the sharing\nof it through repetition. More precisely, as Derrida says,\n\u201cSince [sovereignty] never succeeds in [not sharing] except in a\ncritical, precarious, and unstable fashion, sovereignty can only\ntend, for a limited time, to reign without sharing. It can\nonly tend toward imperial hegemony. To make use of the time is already\nan abuse\u201d (Rogues, p. 102, Derrida\u2019s emphasis).\nThis tendency defines what Derrida calls \u201cthe worst,\u201d a\ntendency toward the complete appropriation or extermination of all the\nothers.\n",
