    "main_text": "Metaphysics || Essence and Being\n6.2 Essence and Being\n\nBrito also contributes to the famous medieval debate about whether\nthere is a fundamental difference between a thing\u2019s essence and\nits being (essentia et esse). In his reply to the question\nwhether being belongs to the essence of things, Brito, like Siger of\nBrabant before him, takes issue with Aquinas\u2019 position,\naccording to which being would be something added to the essence of a\nthing, though not as an accident. Aquinas\u2019 position posits an\nodd constituent of things, which is neither essential nor accidental,\nbut, as Brito calls it, \u201cfictional\u201d (figmentum)\n(Ebbesen 2001: 476).\n\nBrito\u2019s position is that essence and being are identical\n(QMet: IV.2).\nHis argument can be summarized as\nfollows:\n\n A thing x has being either by itself (i.e., essentially)\nor by something else, say by \\(x_{1}\\).\n If by itself, then being belongs to its essence; if by \\(x_{1}\\),\nthen \\(x_{1}\\) has being either by itself or by something else, say by\n\\(x_{2}\\).\n If by itself, then the same conclusion must obtain with respect\nto x; if by something else, then there would be an infinite\nregress.\n Therefore, x has being by itself.\n\n\nBrito\u2019s opponents attack either step 2 or step 3 of his\nargument. The objection to step 2 states that a thing\u2019s being\ndoes not need have being, in the same way that the whiteness that\nmakes something white needs not be white; so, \\(x_{1}\\) need not have\nbeing. A first objection to step 3 rejects the infinite regress,\nbecause there may be a \\(x_{n}\\) that has being by itself\u2014the\nfirst cause (QMet: IV.2).\nAccording to a second objection to\nstep 3, not everything is such that its being and essence differ, so\nsome \\(x_{n}\\)\u2019s being and essence can be the same without this\nleading to the same conclusion with respect to x.\n\nBrito\u2019s position is clearly articulated in his reply to these\nobjections. In fact, whatever is predicated of a thing is predicated\non the basis of something that is either essential or accidental to\nit. If being is not predicated essentially, then it must be predicated\nby means of an accidental attribute. But according to Brito accidents\nhave\n being,[9]\n therefore step 2 stands. Moreover, if being belongs to the essence of\nsome \\(x_{n}\\), which is not the first cause, then it must belong to\nthe essence of any \\(x_{n}\\), which is not the first cause; therefore,\nstep 3 also stands. And no \\(x_{n}\\) can be the first cause, because,\nBrito tells us, being is an intrinsic and formal disposition of\nthings, which the first cause cannot be (QMet: IV.2; cf. Donati\n2013: 348). In other words, the predication of being cannot be based\non something that is neither essential nor accidental; and whoever\nclaims that it is based on something accidental will be committed to\nan infinite regress. Consequently, being is predicated essentially of\nthings, i.e., it belongs to them essentially.\n",
