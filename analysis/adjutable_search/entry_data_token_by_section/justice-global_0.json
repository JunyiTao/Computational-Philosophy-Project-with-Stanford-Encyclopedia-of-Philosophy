    "main_text": "Some Definitional Issues || Global and International Justice\n1.1 Global and International Justice\n\nA distinction is often drawn between global and\ninternational justice. The key point of difference between\nthese two notions involves clarifying the entities among which justice\nis sought. In international justice the nation or state is taken as\nthe central entity of concern and justice among nations or states is\nthe focus. In the domain of global justice, by contrast, theorists do\nnot seek primarily to define justice between states or nations. Rather\nthey drill down through the state shell and inquire about what justice\nrequires among human beings. Global justice inquiries take individual\nhuman beings as of primary concern and seek to give an account of what\nfairness among such agents involves. There are several types of\nactions that cut across states or involve different agents,\nrelationships, and structures that might be invisible in an inquiry\nseeking justice among states exclusively. Many different kinds of\ninteractions are not circumscribed by state membership and yet can\nimportantly affect human beings\u2019 most fundamental interests, so\nasking the question about what individual human beings owe one another\noften uncovers significant neglected features of relationships and\nstructures that are of normative concern. Global justice analyses are\nnot precluded from yielding state-level obligations; indeed, they\ntypically do. However, they consider a wider array of possible agents\nand organizations that might have duties as well.\n\nThere are advantages associated with both types of inquiries. An\nimportant advantage of asking what states owe one another is that much\ninternational law presupposes the states system and requires states to\nperform various actions to promote justice. In this way,\nresponsibilities often appear to be clearly allocated to particular\nparties thus making it quite precise who ought to do what in our\nactual world. One advantage of global justice inquiries is that we are\nnot forced to take states as a fixed constraint and we can therefore\nconsider a range of relevant relationships, capacities and roles that\nalso structure our interactions and might be relevant to how we ought\nto conceptualize global responsibilities. While asking about what\nindividuals owe each other may well have implications for states and\ntheir obligations, a range of other agents and institutions may also\nhave relevant justice obligations. These responsibilities can become\nmore visible when we explore what individuals owe each other. The two\napproaches have different strengths and can complement each other, but\nin contemporary debate they are often taken as rivals competing to\nprovide the most plausible framework.\n\nFor further discussion of international justice, see the entry on\n international distributive justice.\n",
