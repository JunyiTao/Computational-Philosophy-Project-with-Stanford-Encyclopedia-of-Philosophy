Problems\n\n\u2018A hole?\u2019 the rock chewer grunted.\n\u2018No, not a hole,\u2019 said the will-o\u2019-the-wisp despairingly.\n\u2018A hole, after all, is something. This is nothing at\nall\u2019.\n\u2014Ende (1974/1985: 24)\n\n\n\nHole representations\u2014no matter whether veridical\u2014appear to\nbe commonplace in human cognition. Not only do people have the\nimpression of seeing holes; they also form a corresponding concept,\nwhich is normally lexicalised as a noun in ordinary languages. (Some\nlanguages even discriminate different types of hole, distinguishing\ne.g. between superficial hollows, inner cavities,\nand see-through\nperforations.) Moreover, data from developmental psychology\nand the psychology of perception confirm that infants and adults are\nable to perceive, count, and track holes just as easily as they\nperceive, count, and track paradigm material objects such as cookies\nand tins (Giralt & Bloom 2000; Nelson & Palmer 2001; Horowitz\n& Kuzmova 2011). These facts do not prove that holes and material\nobjects are on equal psychological footing, let alone on equal\nmetaphysical footing. But they indicate that the concept of a hole is\nof significant salience in the common-sense picture of the world,\nspecifically of the spatiotemporal world.\n\n\nIf holes are entities of a kind, then, they appear to be\nspatiotemporal particulars, like cookies and tins and unlike numbers\nor moral values. They appear to have a determinate shape, a size, and\na location. (\u2018These things have birthplaces and histories. They\ncan change, and things can happen to them\u2019, Hofstadter &\nDennett 1981: 6\u20137.) On the other hand, if holes are particulars,\nthen they are not particulars of the familiar sort. For holes appear\nto be immaterial: every hole has a material\n\u201chost\u201d (the stuff around it, such as the edible part of a\ndonut) and it may have a material \u201cguest\u201d (such as the\nliquid filling a cavity), but the hole itself does not seem to be made of\nmatter. Indeed, holes seem to be made of nothing, if anything\nis.  And this gives rise to a number of conundrums. For example:\n\nIt is difficult to explain how holes can in fact be perceived. If\nperception is grounded on causation, as Locke urged (Essay,\nII-viii-6), and if causality has to do with materiality, then\nimmaterial bodies cannot be the source of any causal flow. So a causal\ntheory of perception would not apply to holes. Our impression of\nperceiving holes would then be a sort of systematic illusion, on pain\nof rejecting causal accounts of perception. (On the other hand, if one\naccepts that absences can be causally efficacious, as urged by Lewis\n2004, then a causal account could maintain that we truly perceive\nholes; see Sorensen 2008 and 2015 along with Siegel 2009, Farennikova 2013, \nand Calabi 2019.)\nIt is difficult to specify identity criteria for holes\u2014more\ndifficult than for ordinary material objects. If holes are immaterial,\nwe cannot account for the identity of a hole via the identity\nof any constituting stuff. But neither can we rely on the identity\nconditions of the hole\u2019s material host, for we can imagine\nchanging the host\u2014partly or wholly, gradually or\nabruptly\u2014without affecting the hole. And we cannot rely on the\nidentity conditions of its guest, for it would seem that we can empty\na hole of whatever might partially or fully occupy it and leave the\nhole intact. (Indeed, both \u201chost\u201d and \u201cguest\u201d\nare relative notions. Doesn\u2019t their proper application\npresuppose that we already know how to identify holes in the first\nplace? See Meadows 2015.)\nIt is equally difficult to account for the mereology of\nholes. Take a card and punch a hole in it. You have made one hole. Now\npunch again next to it. Have you made another hole? In a way, yes: now\nthe card is doubly perforated. But what prevents us from saying that\nwe still have one hole, though a hole that comes in two disconnected\nparts? After all, material objects can be disconnected: a bikini, your\ncopy of the Recherche, a token of the lowercase letter\n\u2018i\u2019. Perhaps holes may be disconnected, too? If so,\nperhaps we have just punched a single, disconnected hole? (Casati\n& Varzi 2004, 2021)\nIt is also difficult to assess the explanatory relevance of holes.\nArguably, whenever a physical interaction can be explained by appeal to\nthe concept of a hole, a matching explanation can be offered invoking\nonly material objects and their properties. (That water flowed out of\nthe bucket is explained by a number of facts about water fluidity,\ncombined with an accurate account of the physical and geometric\nconditions of the bucket.) Aren\u2019t these latter explanations\nenough?\n\n\n\nFurther problems arise from the ambiguous status of holes in\nfigure-ground displays (Bozzi 1975). Thus, for example, though it\nappears that the shapes of holes can be recognized by humans as\naccurately as the shapes of ordinary objects, the area seen through a\nhole typically belongs to the background of its host, and there is\nevidence to the effect that background regions are not represented as\nhaving shapes (Bertamini & Croucher 2003; Bertamini & Casati\n2015). So what would the shape of a hole be, if any?\n",
