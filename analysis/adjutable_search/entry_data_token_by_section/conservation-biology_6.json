One of the fundamental patterns the biologists\nhave attempted to explain is the species-area effect. That is, why do\nlarger islands support more species than smaller ones? It seems that\nas the area of an island increases, so does species richness. The\nspecies-area effect is the product of the area effect namely that more\nspecies are found on larger islands rather than smaller, and the\ndistance effect namely that islands closer to the mainland have more\nspecies than those that are further. E. O. Wilson and Robert H.\nMacArthur provided one of the famous potential explanations of the\nspecies area effect. They did so through their equilibrium model of\nisland biogeography (MacArthur & Wilson 1963, 1967). They began\nwith several assumptions. First, species richness on an island has a\nstable equilibrium. Second, the stable equilibrium is due to the\nimmigration rate from the mainland to the island and the extinction\nrate on the island. Third, the distance of the island from the\nmainland by itself determines the rate of immigration. Fourth, the\nextinction rate is determined solely by the island\u2019s size.\nFifth, the stable equilibrium is a dynamic one. The number of species\nare the island is constant, but the composition of species on the\nisland changes. This rate of change is the species turnover rate.\n\nMacArthur and Wilson formulated a mathematical model with these\nassumptions (Wilson & Bossert 1971). Suppose \\(P\\) is a parameter\nrepresenting a pool of species. Let the total immigration rate\n\\(\\lambda_{S}\\) be the number of new species colonizing an island per\nunit time. Let the total extinction rate \\(\\mu_{S}\\) be the number of\nspecies on the island going extinct per unit time. Thus, the\ninstantaneous rate of change of species on the island is,\n\n\\[\n\\frac{dS}{dt} = \\lambda_{S} - \\mu_{S}\n\\]\n\n\nIf \\(\\lambda_{S} = \\mu_{S}\\), then \\(dS/dt = 0\\), and we have an\nequilibrium \\(S^*\\). Assume that \\(S\\) species are present on our\nisland. We characterize the total immigration rate as follows. Let\n\\(\\lambda_{A}\\) be the average immigration rate of new species\ncolonizing the island per unit time, and thus the total immigration\nrate is \\(\\lambda_{S} = \\lambda_{A}(P-S)\\). The total extinction rate\ncan be characterized as well. Let the average extinction rate per\nspecies per unit be \\(\\mu_{A}\\). Then \\(\\mu_{S} = \\mu_{A}S.\\)\nTherefore, \\(dS/dt = \\lambda_{A}(P-S) - \\mu_{A}\\). Finally, we can\nderive \\(dS/dt\\) evaluated at the equilibrium \\(S^*\\), \n\n\\[\n\\Bigl.\\frac{dS}{dt}\\Bigr|_{\\substack{S=S^*}} = \\lambda_{S} - \\mu_{S} = \\lambda_{A}(P-S) - \\mu_{A}S = 0\n\\]\n\n\nThis is equivalent to the following expression \n\n\\[\nS^* = \\frac{\\lambda_{A}P}{\\lambda_{A} + \\mu_{A}}\n\\]\n\n\nBy integrating the differential equation, we have, \n\n\\[\nS^* = \\frac{\\lambda_{A}P}{\\lambda_{A} + \\mu_{A}}(1 - e^{-(\\lambda_{A} + \\mu_{A})^{t}})\n\\]\n\n\nAs \\(t\\) increases, \\( e^{-(\\lambda_{A} + \\mu_{A})^{t}}\\) approaches\nzero.\n\nWe can also derive an expression for the species turnover rate.\nMacArthur and Wilson as we saw thought that though the number of\nspecies on an island would be constant, their identities would be\nconstantly changing. Suppose we are interested in some fraction say\n90% of the equilibrium number of species \\(S^*\\). Then, we multiply\nboth sides of the above by \\(0.9\\), and have \\(0.9S^* =\n\\lambda_{A}P/(\\lambda_{A} + \\mu_{A}) \\times 0.9\\). From the above, it\nfollows that \\((1 - e^{-(\\lambda_{A} + \\mu_{A})^{t}}) = 0.9\\). With\nsome algebra and taking the natural logarithms, we arrive at the\nspecies turnover rate, \n\n\\[\nt_{0.9} = \\frac{2.3}{\\lambda_{A} + \\mu_{A}}\n\\]\n\n\nFinally, let us assume that each species \\(S_i\\)\u2019s size is\nproportional to the island\u2019s area and the probability that a\nspecies goes extinct decreases as island size becomes smaller.\n\n\n\n\nA\n\n\n\n\nB\n\n\n\nFigure 3: Equilibrium model and\nexplanation of the species area effect (MacArthur & Wilson 1967:\n26)\n\n\n\nWhere the immigration rate \\(I\\) and extinction rate \\(E\\) cross is\nthe species equilibrium \\(S^*\\) (Figure 3B). Moreover, the island\nwhose immigration rate is \\(I_\\text{near}\\) and whose extinction rate\nis \\(E_\\text{large}\\) has the largest species equilibrium. The one\nwith the smallest is the one with \\(I_\\text{far}\\) and\n\\(E_\\text{small}\\) (Figure 3A).\n\nAfter constructing their model, E. O. Wilson and his graduate student\nDaniel Simberloff tested the model by devising natural experiments in\nthe Florida keys (Simberloff & Wilson 1970). They had islands\ndefaunated of varying sizes and distances from the mainland. They\ncould then evaluate the predictions and assumptions of the model. They\ndetermined that species abundances returned to their previous\nequilibria and species richness on an island appeared to be determined\nby the size of the island and its distance from the mainland. However,\nSimberloff was able to show that the equilibrium model predicted that\nthe species turnover rate was much higher than what was measured\n(Simberloff 1976). In some ways, it is not a surprise that the model\nwas predictively inaccurate since it was highly idealized. MacArthur\nand Wilson had assumed distance alone determines the immigration rate\nand size alone determines the extinction rate. MacArthur and Wilson\nwrote,\n\n\nWe do not seriously believe that the particular formulations advanced\nin the chapters to follow will fit for very long the exacting results\nof future empirical investigation. We hope instead that they will\ncontribute to the stimulation of new forms of theoretical and\nempirical studies, which will lead in turn to a stronger general\ntheory\u2026. (MacArthur & Wilson 1967)\n\n\nBut conservation biologists quickly embraced the model and began to\napply it to new topics, the most important of which was reserve\ndesign.\n\nSeveral conservation biologists, but especially Jared Diamond, argued\nthat single large reserves were better than several small ones (SLOSS)\n(Diamond 1975a,b; May 1975; Terborgh 1975; Wilson & Willis\n1975).\n\n\n\nFigure 4: Principles as depicted in the\nSLOSS debate (Diamond 1975b: 174)\n\n\nThe principles debated included (A) larger reserves are better than\nsmaller ones, (B) a large reserve is better than a few small ones of\nthe same total area, (C) several reserves close to one another are\nbetter than several further apart, (D) when there are several reserves\nthey should be grouped equidistantly rather then linearly, (E)\nreserves connected by corridors are better than unconnected ones, and\n(F) compact shapes are better for minimizing boundary length (1975b:\n143\u20135).\n\nOften the relation between species and area is represented by the\nfollowing equation, \\(S = kA^z\\) where \\(S\\) is species richness,\n\\(A\\) is area, and \\(k\\) and \\(z\\) are constants (\\(z\\) is usually\nbetween 0.2 and 0.35). Clearly, as \\(A\\) increases other things being\nequal, \\(S\\) should increase as well. So, it was argued that larger\nreserves are better for conserving species than smaller ones. Note\nthat if the reserve is isolated from other such reserves then only the\nextinction rate matters according to the equilibrium model. In 1976,\nDaniel Simberloff and Lawrence Abele argued that this line of argument\nwas incorrect (Simberloff & Abele 1976). Suppose we have a single\nreserve of size \\(A_1\\) and juxtapose it against two with size \\(A_2 =\nA_1/2\\) each and that \\(z = 0.263\\) (this precise value is not\nimportant to the argument). Each of the two small reserves would have\n\\(S_2 = kA_{2}^z\\) species. If all of the species \\(P\\) in the pool\nare capable of dispersing in and surviving in the refuges, then the\ntotal expected number of species in both refuges is \\(2S_2 -\nS_2^2/P\\); namely the species in either small reserve minus those in\nboth. How many species \\(S_1\\) would be in the large reserve \\(A_1\\)?\nSimberloff and Abele determined that \\(S_1 = kA_1^z = k(2A_2)^z =\n1.200 \\times S_2\\). They pointed out that this is less than the total\nexpected number of species \\(2S_2 - S_2^2/P\\) in the two smaller\nreserves when \\(S_1/P \\lt 0.96\\). Another important criticism of the\nuse of the equilibrium model in reserve design was that reserves were\nunlike islands in an ocean (Margules, Higgs, & Rafe 1982).\nSpecifically, the equilibrium model assumes that between the mainland\nand island no species of the pool can exist; i.e., the immigration\nrate is zero. However, when we consider areas between reserves, it\noften is possible for species to occur even if at lower abundances.\nThus, the equilibrium model could not be extended without violation of\nits assumptions to other habitat types such mountain tops (J.H. Brown\n1971).\n\nThe SLOSS debate was vociferous and the arguments continued for quite\nsome time. The importance of the equilibrium model of island\nbiogeography was much discussed and hotly contested (R.J. Whittaker\n& Fern\u00e1ndez-Palacios 2007).\n",
