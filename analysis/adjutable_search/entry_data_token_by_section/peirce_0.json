    "main_text": "Brief Biography\n1. Brief Biography\n\n\nCharles Sanders Peirce was born on September 10, 1839 in Cambridge,\nMassachusetts, and he died on April 19, 1914 in Milford,\nPennsylvania. His writings extend from about 1857 until near his\ndeath, a period of approximately 57 years. His published works run to\nabout 12,000 printed pages and his known unpublished manuscripts run\nto about 80,000 handwritten pages. The topics on which he wrote have\nan immense range, from mathematics and the physical sciences at one\nextreme, to economics, psychology, and other social sciences at the other\nextreme.\n\n\nPeirce\u2019s father Benjamin Peirce was Professor of Mathematics at\nHarvard University and was one of the founders of, and for a while \na director of, the U. S. Coast and\nGeodetic Survey as well as one of the founders of the Smithsonian\nInstitution.  The department of mathematics at Harvard was essentially\nbuilt by Benjamin. From his father, Charles Sanders Peirce received\nmost of the substance of his early education as well as a good deal of\nintellectual encouragement and stimulation. Benjamin\u2019s didactic\ntechnique mostly took the form of setting interesting problems for his\nson and checking Charles\u2019s solutions to them. In this challenging\ninstructional atmosphere Charles acquired his lifelong habit of\nthinking through philosophical and scientific problems entirely on his\nown. To this habit, perhaps, is to be attributed Charles Peirce\u2019s\nconsiderable originality.\n\n\nPeirce graduated from Harvard in 1859 and received the bachelor of\nscience degree in chemistry in 1863, graduating summa cum\nlaude. Except for his remarkable marks in chemistry Peirce was a\npoor student, typically in the bottom third of his class. Obviously,\nthe standard curriculum bored him, so that he mostly avoided doing\nseriously its required work. For thirty-two years, from 1859 until the\nlast day of 1891, he was employed by the U. S. Coast and Geodetic\nSurvey, mainly surveying and carrying out geodetic\ninvestigations. Some of this work Peirce undertook simply to finance\nhis diurnal existence (and that of his first wife Melusina (Zina)\nFay), while he devoted the main force of his thinking to abstract\nlogic. Nevertheless, the geodetic tasks involved making careful\nmeasurements of the intensity of the earth\u2019s gravitational field by\nmeans of using swinging pendulums. The pendulums that Peirce used were\noften of his own design. For over thirty years, then, Peirce was\ninvolved in practical and theoretical problems associated with making\nvery accurate scientific measurements. This practical involvement in\nphysical science was crucial in his ultimately coming to reject\nscientific determinism, as we shall see.\n From 1879 until 1884, Peirce maintained a second job teaching\nlogic in the Department of Mathematics at Johns Hopkins\nUniversity. During that period the Department of Mathematics was\nheaded by the famous mathematician J. J. Sylvester, whom Peirce had\nmet earlier through his father Benjamin. This teaching period also was\ncharacterized by Peirce\u2019s having several students who made names for\nthemselves in their own right. Among these were Oscar Howard Mitchell,\nAllan Marquand, Benjamin Ives Gilman, Joseph Jastrow, Fabian Franklin,\nChristine Ladd (later, after having married Fabian Franklin, Christine\nLadd-Franklin), Thorstein Veblen, and John Dewey.  Brief commentary\nwill be offered at the end of this essay on three of these figures:\nJohn Dewey, Oscar Howard Mitchell, and Christine Ladd.  It is\nsometimes said that William James was also one of Peirce\u2019s students,\nbut this claim is erroneous: it conflates the fact of James\u2019s being an\nold and a close friend of Peirce, as well as being a fellow-member\nwith Peirce in the so-called \u201cMetaphysical Club\u201d in\nCambridge, Massachusetts, with the non-fact of James\u2019s being a student\nof Peirce at Johns Hopkins University along with John Dewey and\nothers.\n\n\nPeirce\u2019s teaching job at Johns Hopkins was suddenly terminated for\nreasons that are apparently connected with the fact that Peirce\u2019s\nsecond wife (Juliette Annette Froissy, a.k.a. Juliette Annette\nPourtalai) was Romani, moreover a Roma with whom Peirce had more or\nless openly cohabited before marriage and before his divorce from his\nfirst wife Zina.  (In fact Peirce obtained his divorce from Zina only\ntwo days before marrying Juliette.) The Johns Hopkins position was\nPeirce\u2019s only academic employment, and after losing it Peirce worked\nthereafter only for the U. S. Coast and Geodetic Survey (and\nconstructing entries for the Century Dictionary) and writing\nbook reviews for the Nation.  The government employment came\nto an end the last day of 1891, ultimately because of funding\nobjections to pure research (and perhaps also to Peirce\u2019s extravagant\nspending and to his procrastination in finishing his required reports)\nthat were generated in an ever-practical-minded Congress.  Thereafter,\nPeirce often lived on the edge of penury, eking out a living doing\nintellectual odd-jobs (such as translating or writing occasional\npieces) and carrying out consulting work (mainly in chemical\nengineering and analysis). For the remainder of his life, except for\nmoney inherited from his mother and aunt, Peirce was often in dire\nfinancial straits; sometimes he managed to survive only because of the\novert or covert charity of relatives or friends, for example that of\nhis old friend William James.\n\n\nIn his youth Peirce was amazingly precocious, and he began to study\nlogic seriously at an extraordinarily early age. According to noted\nPeirce scholar Max Fisch in his\u201cIntroduction\u201d to Volume 1\nof The Writings of Charles S. Peirce: A Chronological\nEdition, p. xviii, Peirce\u2019s introduction to and first immersion\nin the study of logic came in 1851 within a week or two of his turning\n12 years of age. Remembering the occasion in 1910, in his \u201cNote\non the Doctrine of Chances,\u201d in Collected Papers of Charles\nS. Peirce, Volume II, Section 408 (hereinafter such Collected\nPapers references will be cited as CP, 2.408), Peirce\nhimself remembered the crucial event as having occurred in 1852, when\nhe was 13 years old. Regardless of his exact age, at the time of the\nevent Charles encountered and then over a period of at most a few days\nstudied and absorbed a standard textbook of the time on logic by\nBishop Richard Whately. Having become fascinated by logic, he began to\nthink of all issues as problems in logic. During his freshman year at\ncollege (Harvard), in 1855, when he was 16 years old, he and a friend\nbegan private study of philosophy in general, starting with Schiller\u2019s\nLetters on the Aesthetic Education of Man and continuing with\nKant\u2019s Critique of Pure Reason. Schiller\u2019s distinction among\nthe three basic human drives of Stofftrieb,\nFormtrieb, and Spieltrieb Peirce never forgot or\nrenounced, and it became the basis for Peirce\u2019s distinction between\nthe man of practical affairs, the man of scientific activity, and the\nman of aesthetic practice. By Kant Peirce was initially more or less\nrepelled. After three years of intense study of Kant, Peirce concluded\nthat Kant\u2019s system was vitiated by what he called its \u201cpuerile\nlogic,\u201d and about the age of 19 he formed the fixed intention of\ndevoting his life to the study of and to research in logic. It was,\nhowever, impossible at that time, as indeed Peirce\u2019s father Benjamin\ninformed him, to earn a living as a research logician; and Peirce\ndescribed himself at the time of his graduation from Harvard in 1859,\njust short of his 20th birthday, as wondering \u201cwhat I would do\nin life.\u201d Within two years, however, he had more or less\nresolved his problem.  During those two years he had worked as an Aid\non the Coast Survey, in Maine and Louisiana, then had returned to\nCambridge and had studied natural history and natural philosophy at\nHarvard. He said of himself that in 1861 he \u201cNo longer wondered\nwhat I would do in life but defined my object.\u201d It is evident\nthat his adoption of the profession of chemistry and his practice of\ngeodesy allowed Charles both to support himself (and before long also\nhis first wife Zina) and to continue to engage in researches on\nlogic. From the early 1860s until his death in 1914 his output in\nlogic was voluminous and varied.  One of his logical systems became\nthe basis for Ernst Schroeder\u2019s great three-volume treatise on logic,\nthe Vorlesungen ueber die Algebra der Logik.\n\n\nPeirce, then, had early and deep disagreements with Kant\u2019s position\nabout logic, and he never altered his view that Kant\u2019s view of logic\nwas superficial: \u201c\u2026 he [i.e. Kant] never touches this\nlast doctrine [i.e. logic] without betraying marks of hasty,\nsuperficial study\u201d (Collected Papers of Charles Sanders\nPeirce, Volume 2, Section 3; hereafter such Collected\nPapers references will be cited as as CP, 2.3). Even\nworse, Peirce held, was the Logik of Hegel: Kant\u2019s fault\n\u201c\u2026 is a hundredfold more true of Hegel\u2019s Logik\n\u2026\u2009. That work cannot justly be regarded as anything more\nthan a sketch\u201d (CP, 2.32).\n\n\nNevertheless, Peirce continued to respect and read the first\nCritique throughout his life.  For a fuller discussion\nof Peirce\u2019s own views about how his work related to that of\nKant, Hegel, and Schelling, see the supplementary document:\n\nPeirce\u2019s View of the Relationship Between His Own Work and German Idealism\n\n",
