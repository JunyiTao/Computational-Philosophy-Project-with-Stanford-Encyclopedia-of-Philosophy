    "main_text": "Objections to Consequentializing || Act-Consequentialist Counterpart Theories Are Gimmicky\n4.3 Act-Consequentialist Counterpart Theories Are Gimmicky\n\nSome philosophers claim that consequentializing a target\nnon-consequentialist theory results in a gimmicky act-consequentialist\ncounterpart theory\u2014and, thus, one that\u2019s implausible (see,\ne.g., Nozick 1974: 29). And, admittedly, the resulting\nact-consequentialist counterpart theory can seem gimmicky when we\narrive at it via the Footian Procedure. In that case, the\nconsequentializer just takes whatever features of actions that the\ntarget non-consequentialist theory holds to be intrinsically\nwrong-making and insists that they are instead features of outcomes\nthat make them rank poorly. So, if the non-consequentialist theory\nholds that an act\u2019s being a promise-breaking is, other things\nbeing equal, what makes it wrong, the consequentializer will hold\ninstead that an outcome\u2019s including a promise-breaking is, other\nthings being equal, what makes it rank lower than one that\ndoesn\u2019t. And this move can seem ad hoc.\n\nBut the fact that the resulting act-consequentialist counterpart\ntheories are gimmicky (and, thus, ad hoc) is no objection to\neither notational consequentializing or pragmatic consequentializing.\nSuch consequentializers will readily concede that these resulting\ntheories are gimmicky. The notational consequentializer will argue\nthat all extensionally equivalent theories are gimmicky\nrepresentations of each other in that they are all just arbitrarily\ndifferent notational variants on the same moral view. So, the fact\nthat consequentializing produces gimmicky act-consequentialist\ncounterpart theories is no objection to notational consequentializing.\nAnd it\u2019s no objection to pragmatic consequentializing either.\nThe pragmatic consequentializer is happy to admit not only that the\nresulting act-consequentialist counterpart theories are gimmicky but\nalso that they are, consequently, implausible. For pragmatic\nconsequentializers reject the resulting act-consequentialist\ncounterpart theories that they construct merely for certain pragmatic\npurposes.\n\nOf course, things are different for the earnest consequentializer. It\nwould be a problem if they produced an act-consequentialist\ncounterpart theory that was gimmicky. But, arguably, the result of\nearnest consequentializing isn\u2019t gimmicky given that it employs\nthe Coherentist Procedure rather than the Footian Procedure. Of\ncourse, when the earnest consequentializer accommodates, say, our\nintuition that it\u2019s wrong for Abe to break his promise even to\nprevent both Bert and Carl from breaking theirs, they do so by\ninsisting that Abe ought to prefer the outcome in which he keeps his\npromise and Bert and Carl break theirs to the outcome in which he\nbreaks his promise and Bert and Carl keep theirs. But the motivation\nfor this move isn\u2019t the ad hoc one that making it\nallows them to accommodate this intuition. Instead, the earnest\nconsequentializer motivates this move on independent grounds: agents\nbear a special responsibility for their own agency and, thus, for\ntheir own promises. Thus, an agent should, other things being equal,\nblame themselves more harshly for breaking one of their own promises\nthan for letting two others each break one of theirs. And this\nmotivation should appeal even to non-consequentialists. For\nnon-consequentialists, such as Bernard Williams, have powerfully\nargued that agents have a special responsibility for their own\nactions, a responsibility that they don\u2019t bear for what they\nallow others to do. In any case, this thought that agent\u2019s bear\na special responsibility for their own agency can motivate the earnest\nconsequentializer\u2019s claim that agents should prefer, other\nthings being equal, the outcome in which two others violate an\nagent-centered restriction to the outcome in which they themselves\nviolate that restriction\u2014see Otsuka 2011: 42; Portmore 2011:\n100\u2013103; and Williams 1973: 93\u2013100. And, so, there\nneedn\u2019t be anything gimmicky about the way in which the earnest\nconsequentializer motivates these sorts of moves in accommodating our\ncommonsense moral intuitions.\n\nSo, on the one hand, it\u2019s clear that both notational\nconsequentializing and pragmatic consequentializing produce gimmicky\nact-consequentialist counterpart theories by employing the Footian\nProcedure but unclear why this should be objectionable. On the other\nhand, it\u2019s clear that it would be objectionable for the earnest\nconsequentializer to produce a gimmicky act-consequentialist\ncounterpart theory but unclear why we should think that they would\ngiven that they employ the Coherentist Procedure rather than the\nFootian Procedure.\n",
