    "main_text": "The Paradoxes of Motion || The Stadium\n3.4 The Stadium\n\nThe fourth argument is that concerning equal bodies which move\nalongside equal bodies in the stadium from opposite\ndirections\u2014the ones from the end of the stadium, the others from\nthe middle\u2014at equal speeds, in which he thinks it follows that\nhalf the time is equal to its double\u2026. (Aristotle\nPhysics, 239b33)\n\n\nAristotle goes on to elaborate and refute an argument for Zeno\u2019s\nfinal paradox of motion. The text is rather cryptic, but is usually\ninterpreted along the following lines: picture three sets of touching\ncubes\u2014all exactly the same\u2014in relative motion. One\nset\u2014the \\(A\\)s\u2014are at rest, and the others\u2014the\n\\(B\\)s and \\(C\\)s\u2014move to the right and left\nrespectively, at a constant equal speed. And suppose that at some\nmoment the rightmost \\(B\\) and the leftmost \\(C\\) are\naligned with the middle \\(A\\), as shown (three of each are\npictured for simplicity). \n\n\n\u00a0\n\\(A\\)\n\\(A\\)\n\\(A\\)\n\u00a0\n\u00a0 \n\n\\(B\\)\n\\(B\\)\n\\(B\\)\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0 \n\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\\(C\\)\n\\(C\\)\n\\(C\\)\n\u00a0 \n\n\nSince the \\(B\\)s and \\(C\\)s move at same speeds, they will\nbe aligned with the \\(A\\)s simultaneously. \n\n\n\u00a0\n\\(A\\)\n\\(A\\)\n\\(A\\)\n\u00a0\n\u00a0 \n\n\u00a0\n\\(B\\)\n\\(B\\)\n\\(B\\)\n\u00a0\n\u00a0 \n\n\u00a0\n\\(C\\)\n\\(C\\)\n\\(C\\)\n\u00a0\n\u00a0 \n\n\nAt this moment, the rightmost \\(B\\) has traveled past all the\n\\(C\\)s, but only half the \\(A\\)s; since they are of equal\nsize, it has traveled both some distance and half that\ndistance. The putative contradiction is not drawn here however,\npresumably because it is clear that these contrary distances are\nrelative to the \\(C\\)s and \\(A\\)s respectively;\nthere\u2019s generally no contradiction in standing in different\nrelations to different things. Instead, the distances are converted to\ntimes by dividing the distances by the speed of the \\(B\\)s; half\nthe distance at a given speed takes half the time. Then a\ncontradiction threatens because the time between the states is\nunequivocal, not relative\u2014the process takes some (non-zero) time\nand half that time. \n\nThe general verdict is that Zeno was hopelessly confused about\nrelative velocities in this paradox. If the \\(B\\)s are moving\nwith speed S m/s to the right with respect to the\n\\(A\\)s, and if the \\(C\\)s are moving with speed S\nm/s to the left with respect to the \\(A\\)s, then the\n\\(C\\)s are moving with speed \\(S+S = 2\\)S\nm/s to the left with respect to the \\(B\\)s. And so, of\ncourse, while the \\(B\\)s travel twice as far relative to the\n\\(C\\)s as the \\(A\\)s, they do so at twice the relative\nspeed, and so the times are the same either way. But could Zeno have\nbeen this confused? (Sattler, 2015, argues against this and other\ncommon readings of the stadium.)\n\nPerhaps (Davey, 2007) he had the following in mind instead (while Zeno\nis smarter according to this reading, it doesn\u2019t quite fit\nAristotle\u2019s words so well): suppose the \\(A\\)s, \\(B\\)s\nand \\(C\\)s are of the smallest spatial extent,\n\u2018point-sized\u2019, where \u2018points\u2019 are of zero size\nif space is continuous, or finite if space is \u2018atomic\u2019.\nSuppose further that there are no spaces between the \\(A\\)s, or\nbetween the \\(B\\)s, or between the \\(C\\)s. During the motion\nabove the leading \\(B\\) passes all of the \\(C\\)s, and half\nof the \\(A\\)s, so half as many \\(A\\)s as \\(C\\)s. Now,\nas a point moves continuously along a line with no gaps, there is a\n1:1 correspondence between the instants of time and the points on the\nline\u2014to each instant a point, and to each point an instant.\nTherefore, the number of \u2018\\(A\\)-instants\u2019 of time the\nleading \\(B\\) takes to pass the \\(A\\)s is half the number of\n\u2018\\(C\\)-instants\u2019 takes to pass the\n\\(C\\)s\u2014even though these processes take the same amount of\ntime. If we then, crucially, assume that half the instants means half\nthe time, we conclude that half the time equals the whole time, a\ncontradiction. \n\nWe saw above, in our discussion of complete divisibility, the problem\nwith such reasoning applied to continuous lines: any line segment has\nthe same number of points, so nothing can be inferred from the number\nof points in this way\u2014certainly not that half the points (here,\ninstants) means half the length (or time). The paradox fails as\nstated. But doesn\u2019t the very claim that the intervals contain\nthe same number of instants conflict with the step of the argument\nthat concludes that there are half as many \\(A\\)-instants as\n\\(C\\)-instants? This issue is subtle for infinite sets: to give a\ndifferent example, 1, 2, 3, \u2026 is in 1:1 correspondence with 2,\n4, 6, \u2026, and so there are the same number of each. It is in\nthis sense of 1:1 correspondence\u2014the precise sense of\n\u2018same number\u2019 used in mathematics\u2014that any finite\nline has the same number of points as any other. However, informally\nspeaking, there are also \u2018half as many\u2019 even numbers as\nwhole numbers: the pairs (1, 2), (3, 4), (5, 6), \u2026 can also be\nput into 1:1 correspondence with 2, 4, 6, \u2026. Similarly, there\nare\u2014informally speaking\u2014half as many \\(A\\)-instants\nas \\(C\\)-instants: \\(A\\)-instants are in 1:1 correspondence\nwith pairs of \\(C\\)-instants. So there is no contradiction in the\nnumber of points: the informal half equals the strict whole (a\ndifferent solution is required for an atomic theory, along the lines\npresented in the final paragraph of this section). \n\n(Let me mention a similar paradox of motion\u2014the\n\u2018millstone\u2019\u2014attributed to Maimonides. Imagine two\nwheels, one twice the radius and circumference of the other, fixed to\na single axle. Let them run down a track, with one rail raised to keep\nthe axle horizontal, for one turn of both wheels [they turn at the\nsame rate because of the axle]: each point of each wheel makes contact\nwith exactly one point of its rail, and every point of each rail with\nexactly one point of its wheel. Does the assembly travel a distance\nequal to the circumference of the big wheel? Of the small? Both?\nSomething else? How? This problem too requires understanding of the\ncontinuum; but it is not a paradox of Zeno\u2019s so we shall leave\nit to the ingenuity of the reader.) \n\nA final possible reconstruction of Zeno\u2019s Stadium takes it as an\nargument against an atomic theory of space and time, which is\ninteresting because contemporary physics explores such a view when it\nattempts to \u2018quantize\u2019 spacetime. Suppose then the sides\nof each cube equal the \u2018quantum\u2019 of length and that the\ntwo moments considered are separated by a single quantum of time. Then\nsomething strange must happen, for the rightmost \\(B\\) and the\nmiddle \\(C\\) pass each other during the motion, and yet there is\nno moment at which they are level: since the two moments are separated\nby the smallest possible time, there can be no instant between\nthem\u2014it would be a time smaller than the smallest time from the\ntwo moments we considered. Conversely, if one insisted that if they\npass then there must be a moment when they are level, then it shows\nthat cannot be a shortest finite interval\u2014whatever it is, just\nrun this argument against it. However, why should one insist on this\nassumption? The problem is that one naturally imagines quantized space\nas being like a chess board, on which the chess pieces are frozen\nduring each quantum of time. Then one wonders when the red queen, say,\ngets from one square to the next, or how she gets past the white queen\nwithout being level with her. But the analogy is misleading. It is\nbetter to think of quantized space as a giant matrix of lights that\nholds some pattern of illuminated lights for each quantum of time. In\nthis analogy a lit bulb represents the presence of an object: for\ninstance a series of bulbs in a line lighting up in sequence represent\na body moving in a straight line. In this case there is no temptation\nto ask when the light \u2018gets\u2019 from one bulb to the\nnext\u2014or in analogy how the body moves from one location to the\nnext. (Here we touch on questions of temporal parts, and whether\nobjects \u2018endure\u2019 or \u2018perdure\u2019.)\n\n",
