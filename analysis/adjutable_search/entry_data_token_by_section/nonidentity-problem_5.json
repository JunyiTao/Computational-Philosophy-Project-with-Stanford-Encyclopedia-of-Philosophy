    "main_text": "Nonidentity Cases || Wrongful life\n2.4 Wrongful life\n\nIn any case, not all things are possible in the world of new\ntechnologies. Consider, e.g., the legal claim in negligence referred\nto as wrongful life. The claim there is that medical\npersonnel either (1) have failed properly to advise couples of their\nrisk of producing a child with a serious genetic or chromosomal\ndisorder or of the availability of technologies that would have\nenabled them to reduce that risk or (2) have failed to implement those\ntechnologies effectively. The disorders at issue include Down\nsyndrome, Huntington\u2019s disease and hereditary deafness, and the\nrelevant technologies include preconception genetic testing, in vitro\nfertilization followed by pre-implantation genetic diagnosis and\namniocentesis, which can now be performed as early as the 14th week of\npregnancy. Technologies are not yet so advanced that their proper use\nwould have cured the underlying impairment. But their use would have\nenabled the couple to produce either no child at all or a\nnonidentical, if (arguably) better off, child instead. At the same\ntime, it seems clear that, in almost all such cases, the impaired\nchild\u2019s life will be (or, at least, can be made to be)\nunambiguously worth living. It is thus very hard to say in such cases\nhow the negligent act or omission, the act or omission to which the\nchild owes his or her very existence, has harmed, or made things worse\nfor, or otherwise been \u201cbad for,\u201d the child. \n\nThe question wrongful life raises in the law is whether a gynecologist\nor obstetrician who has failed to communicate the advisability of\ngenetic testing, or the lab that has negligently generated a falsely\nreassuring test result, can be held liable to the impaired child under\na claim of negligence. In the absence of the negligent act or\nomission, that particular child would never have existed at all. Yet\nin most cases the child\u2019s life is unambiguously worth living. We\nthus seem forced to say that the negligent act has not harmed\nthe child. Harm \u2013 in the intuitive, comparative, worse off sense\nof that term \u2013 being an essential element of any claim in\nnegligence, it also seems that the child\u2019s action against the\ndoctor or lab should be dismissed as legally invalid. Yet we may well\nthink that the tort law system should be construed as a way of\nincentivizing medical personnel to work to insure that the children\nwhom their efforts help to produce are born free of impairment. And we\nmay also think that the parents\u2019 claim \u2013 called\nwrongful birth \u2013 against those same medical personnel\nfor the additional expense of caring for an impaired child is not an\nadequate incentive \u2013 especially in light of statutes of\nlimitation that cut off the parents\u2019 claim (in contrast to the\nchild\u2019s) soon after the child is born. Legally, then, we face a\ndilemma \u2013 a case where the law of negligence should be\nunderstood as insisting that medical personnel be vigilant in advising\nand conducting genetic testing but where, thanks to the logic of the\nnonidentity problem, those same personnel are in a position to\nunderstand in advance that any negligence on their part cannot\nharm their most plausible victims. \n\nParfit\u2019s \u201ctwo medical programs\u201d case \u2013 more\nprecisely, the program that would encourage women who have a certain\ncondition that \u201ccannot be treated, but always disappears within\ntwo months,\u201d to delay pregnancy \u2013 is structurally similar\nto the wrongful life case (Parfit 1987, 367\u2013368; see also Parfit\n2011 vol. 2, 221\u2013222, and Parfit 2017, 121). In both cases, the\nexistence is worth having, and in both cases the impairment is not the\nkind of thing agents can, given existing technologies, either cure or\nameliorate.\n",
