    "main_text": "Central Themes in Deflationism || The Utility of the Concept of Truth\n1.3 The Utility of the Concept of Truth\n\nIn light of the two central ideas discussed so far \u2013 the idea\nthat the equivalence schema is exhaustive of the notion of truth and\nthe idea that there is no substantive truth property \u2013 you might\nwonder why we have a concept of truth in the first place. After all,\ncontrast this question with the explanation of why we have the concept\nof mammals. A natural suggestion is that it allows us to think and\ntalk about mammals and to develop theories of them. For deflationism,\nhowever, as we have just seen, being true is completely different from\nbeing a mammal; why then do we have a concept of truth? (An analogous\nquestion might be asked about the word \u2018true\u2019, i.e., why\nwe have the word \u2018true\u2019 and related words in our language\nat all. In the following discussion we will not discriminate between\nquestions about the concept of truth and questions about the word\n\u2018true\u2019 and will move back and forth between them.)\n\nThe question of why we have the concept of truth allows us to\nintroduce a third central theme in deflationism, which is an emphasis\nnot merely on the property of truth but on the concept of truth, or,\nequivalently for present purposes, on the word \u2018true\u2019 (cf.\nLeeds 1978). Far from supposing that there is no point having the\nconcept of truth, deflationists are usually at pains to point out that\nanyone who has the concept of truth is in possession of a very useful\nconcept indeed; in particular, anyone who has this concept is in a\nposition to express generalizations that would otherwise require\nnon-standard logical devices, such as sentential variables and\nquantifiers for them.\n\nSuppose, for example, that Jones for whatever reason decides that\nSmith is an infallible guide to the nature of reality. We might then\nsay that Jones believes everything that Smith says. To say this much,\nhowever, is not to capture the content of Jones\u2019s belief. In\norder to do that we need some way of generalizing on the embedded\nsentence positions in a claim like:\n\n(5)\nIf Smith says that birds are dinosaurs, then birds are\ndinosaurs.\n\n\nTo generalize on the relationship indicated in (5), beyond just what\nSmith says about birds to anything she might say, what we want to do\nis generalize on the embedded occurrences of \u2018birds are\ndinosaurs\u2019. So, we need a (declarative) sentential variable,\n\u2018\\(p\\)\u2019, and a universal quantifier governing it. What we\nwant is a way of capturing something along the lines of\n\n(6)\nFor all \\(p\\), if Smith says that \\(p\\), then \\(p.\\)\n\n\nThe problem is that we cannot formulate this in English with our most\nfamiliar way of generalizing because the \u2018\\(p\\)\u2019 in the\nconsequent is in a sentence-in-use position, rather than mentioned or\nnominalized context (as it is in the antecedent), meaning that this\nformal variable cannot be replaced with a familiar English\nobject-variable expression, e.g., \u2018it\u2019.\n\nThis is where the concept of truth comes in. What we do in order to\ngeneralize in the way under consideration is employ the truth\npredicate with an object variable to produce the sentence,\n\n(7)\nFor all \\(x\\), if what Smith said \\(= x\\), then \\(x\\) is\ntrue.\n\n\nRe-rendering the quasi-formal (7) into natural language yields,\n\n(8)\nEverything is such that, if it is what Smith said, then it is\ntrue.\n\n\nOr, to put the same thing more colloquially:\n\n(9)\nEverything Smith says is true.\n\n\nThe equivalence schema (ES-prop) allows us to use (7) (and therefore\n(9)) to express what it would otherwise require the unstatable (6) to\nexpress. For, on the basis of the schema, there is always an\nequivalence between whatever goes in for a sentence-in-use occurrence\nof the variable \u2018\\(p\\)\u2019 and a context in which that\nfilling of the sentential variable is nominalized. This reveals how\nthe truth predicate can be used to provide a surrogate for sentential\nvariables, simulating this non-standard logical device while still\ndeploying the standard object variables already available in ordinary\nlanguage (\u2018it\u2019) and the usual object quantifiers\n(\u2018everything\u2019) that govern them.\n\nThis is how the use of the truth predicate in (9) gives us the content\nof Jones\u2019s belief. And the important point for deflationists is\nthat we could not have stated the content of this belief unless we had\nthe concept of truth (the expression \u2018true\u2019). In fact, for\nmost deflationists, it is this feature of the concept of truth \u2013\nits role in the formation of these sorts of generalizations \u2013\nthat explains why we have a concept of truth at all. This is, as it is\noften put, the raison d\u2019\u00eatre of the concept of\ntruth (cf. Field 1994a and Horwich 1998a).\n",
