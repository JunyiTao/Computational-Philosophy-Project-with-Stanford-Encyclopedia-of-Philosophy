    "main_text": "Newtonian Spacetime || Presentism, Possibilism, Eternalism\n2.1 Presentism, Possibilism, Eternalism\n\nThe geometrical structure of Newtonian spacetime reflects the way we\nordinarily think about time and is the proper backdrop for introducing\nthe three major rival metaphysical views of time, as illustrated\nbelow:\n\n\n\nFigure 1. Three Metaphysics of Time\n\n\nThe first view, represented on the left, is the ontologically austere\nview called presentism, the view that only the present\nexists. The past has been but is no longer, while the future will come\nto be but is not yet. Note that it is the convention of these diagrams\nthat one spatial dimension is suppressed. The present is actually a\nthree dimensional global slice of the spacetime. Moreover, the\nillustration necessarily represents the spatial extent of the present\nas finite and may suggest that time also has a beginning and/or end.\nThese views are, however, merely artifacts of the representation and\nnot integral to presentism, possibilism, or eternalism. The diagram\nillustrating presentism also has four arrows pointing towards the top\nof the page (conventionally taken to represent the future direction)\nattached to the plane representing the present. These arrows are meant\nto indicate something that is integral to presentism, the idea that\nthe present (and hence the existent) constantly shifts or changes.\nThese arrows represent, then, the dynamic aspect of time called\ntemporal becoming or passage. It is widely thought\nthat the deepest problems in the metaphysics of time concern the\nunderstanding of passage or temporal becoming and its relation to\nexistence.\n\nIn contrast to the radical Heraclitean view of presentism, the\nParmenidean eternalist picture on the far right lacks these arrows and\nindicates that there is nothing more special about the temporal\npresent (the now) than the spatial present (the\nhere). Future and past events at a place, on this view, are\nno more or less real than distant events at a time. The now\nlike the here is a function of one\u2019s perspective,\none\u2019s position in the spacetime, and these positions are\nindicated by the line in the spacetime representing the history of\nspacetime locations of a particular object or person. Such a line is\noften called a world line.\n\nThe middle view, possibilism, is indeed an intermediate view. It is a\npassage view, but it is less ontologically sparse than presentism.\nWhile on this view the future is still merely possible rather than\nactual (hence its name), the past has become and is fully actual. If\none thinks of the future as a branching structure of alternative\npossibilities (as the result, perhaps, of free human choices or\nindeterministic quantum measurements), then one can think of the past\nand present as the trunk of that tree, growing as possibilities become\nactual in the present. This view is also known as the growing\nblock view.\n\nPossibilism seems to capture much of the way we think about time and\nbeing. While the sparse symmetry of presentism is attractive, there\nare many deep asymmetries concerning past and future that it fails to\nreflect. I can easily ascertain, for instance, yesterday\u2019s\nclosing number for the Dow Jones Industrial Average, but by no\nefforts, however great, can I now ascertain tomorrow\u2019s close.\nAnd it seems as if my future actions (or certain sorts of quantum\nmeasurements) can actualize some future possibilities as opposed to\nothers, whereas past actions (or the results of past quantum\nmeasurements) seem no longer to admit of past alternatives. Even if\none allows for the possibility of retrocausation, that is, for the\npossibility of an effect preceding its cause in time, it is generally\nheld that a present cause can not change or alter the past. It would\nmerely make the past what it was. (See the entry on\n backwards causation\n for further consideration of this topic.)\n\nEternalism too, prima facie, would seem to have trouble\naccounting for the asymmetries built into possibilism, while also\napparently bearing the burden of an implausible denial of passage. But\nthe first topic to which we shall turn is an argument, prominent in\ntwentieth century philosophy of time, that passage or becoming is a\nself-contradictory idea. If the argument is correct, then neither\npresentism nor possibilism can be correct metaphysical views of time\nand being.\n",
