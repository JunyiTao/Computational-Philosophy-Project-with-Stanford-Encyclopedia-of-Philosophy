    "main_text": "\n\nBruno Bauer (6 September 1809\u201313 April 1882), philosopher,\nhistorian, and theologian. His career falls into two main phases,\ndivided by the Revolutions of 1848. In the 1840s, the period known as\nthe Vorm\u00e4rz or the prelude to the German revolutions of March\n1848, Bauer was a leader of the Left-Hegelian movement, developing a\nrepublican interpretation of Hegel, which combined ethical and\naesthetic motifs. His theory of infinite self-consciousness, derived\nfrom Hegel\u2019s account of subjective spirit, stressed rational\nautonomy and historical progress. Investigating the textual sources of\nChristianity, Bauer described religion as a form of alienation, which,\nbecause of the deficiencies of earthly life, projected irrational,\ntranscendent powers over the self, while sanctioning particularistic\nsectarian and material interests. He criticized the Restoration state,\nits social and juridical base, and its orthodox religious ideology.\nAnalyzing the emergence of modern mass society, he rejected liberalism\nfor its inconsequent opposition to the existing order, and for its\nequation of freedom with property, but he accused socialism of an\ninadequate appreciation of individual autonomy. After the defeats of\n1848, Bauer repudiated Hegel. He predicted a general crisis of\nEuropean civilization, caused by the exhaustion of philosophy and the\nfailure of liberal and revolutionary politics. New prospects of\nliberation would, he believed, issue from the crisis. His late\nwritings examined the emergence of Russia as a world power, opening an\nera of global imperialism and war. These writings influenced\nNietzsche\u2019s thinking on cultural renewal. Friedrich Engels and\nKarl Kautsky claimed Bauer\u2019s religious criticism for the\nsocialist movement, while the anti-traditionalist conservatism of his\nlate work influenced the thought of Carl Schmitt in the twentieth\ncentury.\n",
