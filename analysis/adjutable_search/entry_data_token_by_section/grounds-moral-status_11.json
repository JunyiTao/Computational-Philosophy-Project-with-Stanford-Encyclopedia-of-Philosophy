If the relevant cognitive capacities were\nrudimentary enough, even severely cognitively impaired human beings\nwould qualify. Such an account might appeal to the capacity to\nexperience pleasure or pain (sentience), to have interests or basic\nemotions, or the capacity for consciousness. Whether fetuses at\nvarious stages of development will thereby have FMS depends on which\nrudimentary capacity is appealed to. For example, an early fetus has\ninterests but not consciousness.\n\nThis accommodation does not fit well with the commonsense view, which\nwould see it as overinclusive. Most (but not all) animals meet these\nlowered standards for FMS \u2013 they have the capacity for pleasure,\npain, interests, and consciousness \u2013 and so their moral status\nwould be on a par with most human beings (namely all those who possess\nthese rudimentary capacities). For example, some authors claim that\nrespecting rational nature entails respecting beings that have only\nparts of rational nature or necessary conditions of it (Wood 1998, p.\n197). Such a view seems to treat animals, infants, and severely\ncognitively impaired humans, all of whom exhibit only parts of\nrational nature, as morally on a par with each other and with\nunimpaired adult humans. (See O\u2019Neill 1998 for additional\ncritiques of this kind of Kantian approach.) Many advocates of such\nviews explicitly and gladly embrace this inclusiveness and reject the\ncommonsense view of the status of animals (Regan 2004).\n\nSome philosophers only indirectly focus on rudimentary capacities.\nTheir focus is on the \u201cequal moral consideration\u201d of\ninterests, but they make it clear that possessing rudimentary\ncognitive capacities is a necessary condition for having interests.\nUtilitarianism is the best known equal consideration view, e.g.,\nmaintaining that equal amounts of suffering and pleasure should be\nfactored equally into the utilitarian calculus, regardless of whether\nthe suffering and pleasure is that of a human or animal. Equal\nconsideration may be interpreted this way: since equal interests are\ntreated equally, the beings with those interests are of equal moral\nstatus. Singer (1993), famously associated with the equal\nconsideration view, might fit this interpretation. However, because he\nthinks that self-conscious beings have interests that merely conscious\nbeings lack, he allows that the former beings might have rights that\nthe latter lack. Interestingly, DeGrazia (2008) embraces the same\nideas but goes further by saying that beings who have additional\nrights due to more complex interests have a higher, and thus unequal,\nmoral status compared to beings lacking those interests and rights.\nSome non-utilitarian philosophers adopt the terminology of equal moral\nconsideration (e.g., Regan 2004), as do philosophers who wish to\ntranscend the dichotomy between utilitarian and rights-based\napproaches (DeGrazia 1996).\n\nWhile 5.3 accounts and the equal moral consideration approach may seem\nto imply treating human beings and most animals alike, many of the\ndefenders deny this counterintuitive implication by showing that two\nbeings can have equal moral status (or deserve equal consideration)\nand yet require differential treatment due to differences in the\ninterests impacted. What an unimpaired adult human stands to lose in\nbeing killed, for example, is much weightier than what a bird would\nlose. The capacity of foresight, for example, can make for weightier\ninterests, and so human beings with this or other forms of cognitive\nsophistication are harmed more by death (Rachels 1990,\npp.186\u2013194; Regan 2004, pp. 304 and 324; and DeGrazia 1996).\nPotentiality can also explain differential treatment of two beings\nbased on interests impacted, while maintaining the beings\u2019 equal\nmoral status. For example, there is a stronger reason not to harm a\nbaby as opposed to a cat, given the potential of the baby and not the\ncat for a cognitively sophisticated future (Harman 2003, p. 187,\nalthough this is not explicitly an equal consideration view).\nAdmittedly, in some cases comparative judgments of whose interests are\nmorally weightier, and hence judgments about differential treatment,\ncan be difficult, in part due to the difficulties in knowing the\ncapabilities of minds very different from ours and of comparing\nwell-being across species (DeGrazia 1996).\n\nIn spite of allowing for differential treatment of morally equal\nbeings, the above accounts remain unable to capture a key aspect of\nthe commonsense view: they are unable to account for the differential\ntreatment of both conscious humans with severe irreversible cognitive\nimpairments and infants who will die due to disease before acquiring\ncognitive sophistication, as compared with many animals (such as a\ndog), since here the affected interests are similar. Thus, while one\nmay grant that rudimentary capacities ground some moral status, one\nmust look beyond such capacities to explain the difference in moral\nstatus between humans and most animals.\n\nAnderson (2004), although not an advocate of equal consideration,\nmight seem to have a way around this last criticism. She points out\nthat one can have an interest in being dignified in the eyes of the\nhuman community. While both dogs and humans have this interest, what\nit takes for a human with severe cognitive impairments to be dignified\nmight be quite different from what it takes for an animal with similar\ncognitive abilities to be dignified, possibly leading to different\nrights (pp. 282\u20133). However, she doesn\u2019t explain how the\ninterests in dignity can lead to the strong protections associated\nwith FMS, such as the right not to be killed.\n\nIrrespective of whether Anderson succeeds, all equal moral\nconsideration views, despite their name, seem to be incompatible with\nMcMahan\u2019s interpretation of the equal wrongness thesis\n(discussed in section 2.1). Admittedly, these views are explicitly\nconcerned with what should be done rather than with how to evaluate an\naction\u2019s degree of wrongness when one fails to do what one\nshould. Nonetheless, in allowing or even requiring differential\ntreatment based on differences in the interests impacted, such views\nseem to also imply that an action (such as killing) is more wrong if\nit impacts the victim\u2019s interests more severely, whereas McMahan\nholds that the victim\u2019s age or level of intelligence should not\naffect the wrongness of killing.\n\nNotice that an even more rudimentary feature, which is not cognitive,\nwould have to be considered if one were to accord any moral status to\nall living beings. For example, one can appeal to having a good or\nwell-being of one\u2019s own that can be enhanced or damaged as a\nground of moral status (Taylor 1986, p. 75, and Naess 1986, p. 14). If\n\u201cinterests\u201d are understood broadly enough, then\nnonconscious entities, such as plants, species, and ecosystems have\ninterests (e.g., an interest in fulfilling their nature) and thus some\nmoral standing (Johnson 1993, pp. 146, 148, 184, 287). Of course, the\ncentral challenge for such views is to explain how and why inevitable\nconflicts among all those with a well-being or interests should be\nsettled. It is not enough to provide principles adjudicating these\nconflicts (as does Taylor 1986, p. 261); one must justify these\nprinciples in a way that is not grounded in the moral status of the\nbeings under consideration (since their status is taken to be equal).\nFor additional discussion and critique of these and other views, see\nthe entry on\n environmental ethics.\n",
