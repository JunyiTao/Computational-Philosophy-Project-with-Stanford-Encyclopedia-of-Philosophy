    "main_text": "Motivation and Preliminaries || Causal Relata\n1.5 Causal Relata\n\nA number of different candidates have been proposed for the relata of\ncausal relations. The relata of actual causal relations are often\ntaken to be events (not to be confused with events in the\npurely technical sense), although some authors (e.g., Mellor 2004)\nargue that they are facts. The relata of general causal\nrelations are often taken to be properties or\nevent-types. For purposes of definiteness, \nevents will refer to the relata of actual causation, and\nfactors will refer to the relata of general causation. These\nterms are not intended to imply a commitment to any particular view on\nthe nature of the causal relata.\n\nIn probabilistic approaches to causation, causal relata are\nrepresented by events or random variables in a probability space.\nSince the formalism requires us to make use of negation, conjunction,\nand disjunction, the relata must be entities (or be accurately\nrepresented by entities) to which these operations can be meaningfully\napplied.\n\nIn some theories, the time at which an event occurs or a property is\ninstantiated plays an important role. In such cases, it will be useful\nto include a subscript indicating the relevant time. Thus the relata\nmight be represented by \\(C_t\\) and \\(E_{t'}\\). If the relata are\nparticular events, this subscript is just a reminder; it adds no\nfurther information. For example, if the event in question is the\nopening ceremony of the Rio Olympic games, the subscript\n\u20188/5/2016\u2019 is not necessary to disambiguate it from other\nevents. In the case of properties or event-types, however, such\nsubscripts do add further information. The time index need not refer\nto a date or absolute time. It could refer to a stage in the\ndevelopment of a particular kind of system. For example, exposure to\nlead paint in children can cause learning disabilities. Here the time\nindex would indicate that it is exposure in children, that\nis, in the early stages of human life, that causes the effect in\nquestion. The time indices may also indicate relative times. Exposure\nto the measles virus causes the appearance of a rash approximately two\nweeks later. We might indicate this time delay by assigning exposure a\ntime index of \\(t = 0\\), and rash an index of \\(t = 14\\) (for 14\ndays).\n\nIt is standard to assume that causes and effects must be\ndistinct from one another. This means that they must not\nstand in logical relations or part-whole relations to one another.\nLewis 1986a contains a detailed discussion of the relevant notion of\ndistinctness. We will typically leave this restriction tacit.\n",
