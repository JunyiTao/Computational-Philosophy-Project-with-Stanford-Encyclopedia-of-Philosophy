    "main_text": "Mill\u2019s Practical Philosophy || On Liberty and Freedom of Character and Action\n4.6 On Liberty and Freedom of Character and Action\n\nMill\u2019s argument for freedom of\ncharacter\u2014\u201cIndividuality\u201d (Liberty, XVIII:\n260)\u2014is given in chapter 3 of On Liberty, and is\ntwo-pronged. On the one hand, he argues that it is best for\nindividuals that they are given freedom and space to develop\ntheir own character. On the other, he argues that it best for\nsociety, too. Mill\u2019s argument for the former is Romantic in\ntone, maintaining that, because different individuals have different\nnatures, they must be given space to discover and develop their own\npersonalities and ways of living.\n\n\nHuman nature is not a machine to be built after a model, and set to do\nexactly the work prescribed for it, but a tree, which requires to grow\nand develope itself on all sides, according to the tendency of the\ninward forces which make it a living thing. (Liberty, XVIII:\n263)\n\n\nThe basic diversity of human beings means it is not productive for\nthere to exist an expectation that all individuals will live in a\nsimilar manner. In this sense, the argument is a pragmatic one: that\none mode of life is unlikely to fit all individual tastes. But Mill\nalso suggests that it is a central feature of the good life that it be\na life chosen for oneself. \n\n\nIt is possible that he might be guided in some good path [\u2026]\nBut what will be his comparative worth as a human being? It really is\nof importance, not only what men do, but also what manner of men they\nare that do it. (Liberty, XVIII: 263) \n\n\nAlong with other thinkers of the period\u2014Arnold, Nietzsche, and\nSchiller are all useful points of comparison\u2014Mill believes that\nthe great danger of mass-society is self-repression and conformism,\nleading to the sapping of human energy and creativity. Victorian\nsociety was, he claimed, governed by an ethos of propriety based on\n\u201cChristian self-denial\u201d; Mill, in contrast, encourages the\n\u201cGreek ideal of self-development\u201d (Liberty,\nXVIII: 266). It is individuals that are well-rounded, authentic and\nspontaneous, he believes, that are most truly happy.\n\nIt is also important for society more broadly that individuals be free\nto develop their own ways of living. It is beneficial to have a rich\nvariety of \u201cexperiments of living\u201d (Liberty,\nXVIII: 260) on display in any given society, to allow individuals to\nbe inspired by a wide range of possible forms of life. And the variety\nthat exists within such a context, Mill thinks, key to maintaining\nsocial progress. A \u201cdiversity of character and culture\u201d\nprovides the engine of productive tension that drives a nation\nforward. Without it, Mill fears \u201cChinese stationariness\u201d\n(Liberty, XVIII: 188; De Tocqueville on Democracy in\nAmerica [II], XVIII: 189).\n\n\nThe despotism of custom is everywhere the standing hindrance to human\nadvancement, being in unceasing antagonism to that disposition to aim\nat something better than customary, which is called, according to\ncircumstances, the spirit of liberty, or that of progress or\nimprovement. (Liberty, XVIII: 272)\n\n\nIn chapters 4 and 5 of On Liberty, Mill\u2019s attention\nturns from a general defence of the salutary effects of freedom to an\nan exploration of which actions in particular should or\nshould not be subject to interference. The scope of legitimate\ncoercion is guided by the \u2018harm principle\u2019: \n\n\nthe only purpose for which power can be rightfully exercised over any\nmember of a civilised community, against his will, is to prevent harm\nto others. (Liberty, XVIII: 223; cf. Liberty, XVIII:\n292) \n\n\nAn individual\u2019s action can be legitimately encroached upon if\nand only if that action might harm another individual. Of course, it\nmay not be prudent to intervene in all cases in which it be\nlegitimate to do so. In this sense, the principle merely\nstates the conditions under which interference is\npermissible\u2014not the conditions under which it is desirable.\n\nMill rules out intervention in that \u201cpart of a person\u2019s\nlife which concerns only himself\u201d primarily because\nindividuals\u2014once they have reached \u201cthe maturity of their\nfaculties\u201d\u2014are far more competent with respect to their\nown good than others (Liberty, XVIII: 280, 224; see Turner\n2013).\n\n\n[W]ith respect to his own feelings and circumstances, the most\nordinary man or woman has means of knowledge immeasurably surpassing\nthose that can be possessed by any one else. The interference of\nsociety to overrule his judgment and purposes in what only regards\nhimself, must be grounded on general presumptions; which may be\naltogether wrong, and even if right, are as likely as not to be\nmisapplied to individual cases. (Liberty, XVIII: 277)\n\n\nAs such, there should exist a general presumption against\npaternalistic attempts to interfere with an individual\u2019s\nself-regarding conduct for their own good.\n\nMill readily admits that no conduct is self-regarding in the sense\nthat it affects only the agent themselves. \u201cNo person is an\nentirely isolated being\u201d (Liberty, XVIII: 280). But it\nis only when an individual \u201cviolate[s] a distinct and assignable\nobligation to any other person or persons, the case is taken out of\nthe self-regarding class\u201d (Liberty, XVIII: 281). In the\nsense Mill intends, then, we harm an individual only when we violate\nan obligation to that individual. The damage done by the bad example\nset to others by a drunkard provides no legitimate reason for\ninterference with his conduct; if his drunkenness causes him to\nviolate the obligation to support his family, then that action\nconstitutes a harm and is subject to interference.\n\nMill\u2019s concern, throughout On Liberty, is to preserve\nthe individual\u2019s freedom not only in the face of the threat of\nlegislative or state coercion, but from the threat of more insidious\nforms of social coercion. In mass society, curtain-twitching\njudgmentalism and whispered smear-campaigns can be more dangerously\ncontrolling than formal acts of tyranny, \u201cpenetrating much more\ndeeply into the details of life, and enslaving the soul itself\u201d\n(Liberty, XVIII: 220). And yet, of course, Mill holds that\nindividuals are themselves free to form unfavorable opinions about the\ncharacter of others. We are free to remonstrate with an individual, to\navoid him, and to encourage others to avoid him\u2014that is\nour right. But not to \u201cparade the avoidance\u201d\n(Liberty, XVIII: 278). The dividing line between the\nlegitimate and illegitimate use of our freedom, however, is surely\ndifficult to draw.\n",
