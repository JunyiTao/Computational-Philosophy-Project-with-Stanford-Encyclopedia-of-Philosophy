    "main_text": "The Rejection of Enlightenment Evidentialism\n2. The Rejection of Enlightenment Evidentialism\n\n\nMost contemporary epistemology of religion may be called post\nmodern in the sense of being a reaction to the Enlightenment, in\nparticular to the thesis of the hegemony of\nevidentialism. (Compare Vanhoozer 2003.)  Hegemony is discussed below,\nbut first consider evidentialism. This is the initially plausible\nposition that a belief is justified only if \u201cit is proportioned\nto the evidence\u201d. (Beliefs proportioned to the evidence include,\nas a special case, the evidence itself.) Here several sorts of\nevidence are allowed. One consists of beliefs in that which is\n\u201cevident to the senses\u201d, that is, beliefs directly due to\nsense-experience. Another sort of evidence is that which is\n\u201cself-evident\u201d, that is, obvious once you think about\nit. Evidence may also include the beliefs directly due to memory and\nintrospection. Again moral convictions might count as evidence, even\nif not treated as \u201cself-evident\u201d. But in order to state\nthe sort of evidentialism characteristic of Enlightenment thought, it\nis stipulated that no beliefs asserting the content of religious or\nmystical experiences count as evidence.  For example, if Fatima had an\nexperience that she would describe as of the presence of God she\nshould not treat God\u2019s presence to her as a piece of evidence.  That\ndoes not prevent the claim that someone has had a religious experience\nwith a certain content from counting as evidence. For example, the\nfact that Fatima had an experience as if of God\u2019s presence would be a\npiece of evidence.  Likewise the fact that various people report\nmiracles counts as evidence.\n\n\nEvidentialism implies that no full religious belief (i.e., a religious\nbelief held with full confidence) is justified unless there is\nconclusive evidence for it, or it is self-evident. The content of\nreligious experience has been stipulated not to count as\nevidence. Even if, as Descartes held, the existence of God is\nself-evident, beliefs such as Richard\u2019s in the Trinity and\nRamanujan\u2019s in the divinity of Krishna are not. So the only\navailable evidence for these beliefs would seem to be non-religious\npremises, from which the religious beliefs are inferred. Therefore,\nthe only way of deciding whether the religious beliefs are justified\nwould be to examine various arguments with the non-religious beliefs\nas premises and the religious beliefs as conclusions.\n\n\nAccording to evidentialism it follows that if the arguments for there\nbeing a God, including any arguments from religious experience, are at\nbest probable ones, and if, as most hold, God\u2019s existence is not\nself-evident then no one would be justified in having full belief that\nthere is a God. And the same holds for other religious\nbeliefs. Likewise, it would not be justified to believe even partially\n(i.e., with less than full confidence) if there is not a balance of\nevidence for belief.\n\n\nIn fact it seems that many religious believers combine full belief\nwith \u201cdoubts\u201d in the sense of some reasons for doubting,\nor they combine partial belief with what they take to be weighty\nreasons for disbelief. According to evidentialism this is not\njustified. Other believers consider that, on reflection, they have\nlittle reason for doubting but that they have almost no positive\nevidence for their religious beliefs. According to evidentialism this\ntoo is unjustified.  This raises the question, how can we adjudicate\nbetween an epistemological thesis which might otherwise be believed\nand a religious belief which that thesis implies is unjustified?  The\nEnlightenment assumed two related, hegemony theses, those of\nepistemology and of evidentialism. The hegemony of epistemology states\nthat (a) human beings can discover the correct epistemology in\nisolation from discovering actual human tendencies to form beliefs,\nand so (b) there is an overriding reason to use the correct\nepistemology (once discovered) to correct the above-mentioned\ntendencies.  The hegemony of evidentialism adds to the hegemony of\nepistemology the further thesis that (c) evidentialism is the correct\nepistemology. If, according to evidentialism, full or even partial\nreligious beliefs are unjustified, then, given the hegemony of\nevidentialism there is an overriding reason to reject those beliefs.\nPerhaps the clearest exponent of this position is the comparatively\nrecent Clifford whose use of moral vocabulary conveys well the\noverriding character of the reasons epistemology is said to provide.\nHis position is summed up in the famous quotation: \u201cIt is wrong\nalways, everywhere, and for anyone, to believe anything upon\ninsufficient evidence\u201d (Clifford 1879: 186).\n\n\nAt the other extreme from Clifford is the position of\nfideism, namely, that if an epistemological theory such as\nevidentialism conflicts with the holding of religious beliefs\nthen that is so much the worse for the epistemological theory.\n\n\nThe rejection of the hegemony of epistemology is quite compatible\nwith holding a hegemony thesis for a fragment of epistemology. Such a\nfragment might, for instance, contain the principle of\nself-referential consistency, relied upon by Plantinga (1983:\n60). This states that it is not justified to have a belief according\nto which that belief is itself not justified. Consider, for instance,\nthe extreme case of the person who believes that no belief is\njustified unless it can be proven from premises everyone agrees\nupon. \n\n\nPostmodernism implies more than being post modern in the above sense.\nFor it is the rejection of the hegemony of even a fragment of\nepistemology. That might seem agreeable to fideists.  Postmodernism\ntends, however, to trivialize fideism by obliterating any contrast\nbetween faith in divine revelation and trust in human capacities to\ndiscover the truth. (For a discussion of fideism and postmodernism see\nStiver 2003.) \n\n\nMuch contemporary epistemology of religion seeks to avoid the extremes\nboth of the Enlightenment thesis of the hegemony of evidentialism and\nof fideism. It is thus post modern without necessarily being\npostmodernist. Call the injunction to avoid these extremes\nthe problematic of contemporary epistemology of religion.\n",
