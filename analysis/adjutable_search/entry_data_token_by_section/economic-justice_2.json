    "main_text": "Economics and Ethics || Normative Economics and Political Philosophy\n1.2 Normative Economics and Political Philosophy\n\nThere have been many mutual influences between normative economics and\npolitical philosophy. In particular, Rawls\u2019 difference principle\n(Rawls 1971) has been instrumental in making economic analysis of\nredistributive policies pay some attention to the maximin criterion,\nwhich puts absolute priority on the worst-off, and not only to\nsum-utilitarianism. (It has taken more time for economists to realize\nthat Rawls\u2019 difference principle applies to primary goods, not\nutilities.) Conversely, many concepts used by political philosophers\ncome from various branches of normative economics (see below).\n\nThere are, however, differences in focus and in methodology. Political\nphilosophy tends to focus on the general issue of social justice,\nwhereas normative economics also covers microeconomic issues of\nresource allocation and the evaluation of public policies in an unjust\nsociety (although there is now philosophical work on non-ideal\ntheory). Political philosophy focuses on arguments and basic\nprinciples, whereas normative economics is more concerned with the\neffective ranking of social states than the arguments underlying a\ngiven ranking. The difference is thin in this respect, since the\naxiomatic analysis in normative economics may be interpreted as\nperforming not only a logical decomposition of a given ranking or\nprinciple, but also a clarification of the underlying basic principles\nor arguments. But consider for instance the \u201cleveling-down\nobjection\u201d (Parfit 1995), which states that egalitarianism is\nwrong because it considers that there is something good in\nachieving equality by leveling down (even when the egalitarian ranking\nsays that, all things considered, leveling down is bad). This\nkind of argument has to do with the reasons underlying a social\njudgment, not with the content of the all things considered judgment\nitself. It is hard to imagine if and how the leveling-down objection\ncould be incorporated in the models of normative economics. A final\ndifference between normative economics and political philosophy,\nindeed, lies in conceptual tools. Normative economics uses the formal\napparatus of economics, which gives powerful means to derive\nnon-intuitive conclusions from simple arguments, although it also\ndeprives the analyst of the possibility of exploring issues that are\nhard to formalize.\n\nThere are now several general surveys of normative economics, some of\nwhich do also cover the intersection with political philosophy: Arrow,\nSen and Suzumura (1997, 2002, 2011), Fleurbaey (1996), Hausman and\nMcPherson (2006, rev. and augmented in Hausman et al. 2016), Kolm\n(1996), Moulin (1988, 1995, 1998), Roemer (1996), Young (1994).\n",
