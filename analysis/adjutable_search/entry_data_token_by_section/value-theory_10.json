    "main_text": "Relation to the Deontic || Fitting Attitudes\n3.3 Agent-Relative Value?\n3.3.1 Agent-Centered Constraints\n\nThe most central, in-principle problem for classical consequentialism\nis the possibility of what are called agent-centered\nconstraints (Scheffler [1983]). It has long been a traditional\nobjection to utilitarian theories that because they place no intrinsic\ndisvalue on wrong actions like murder, they yield the prediction that\nif you have a choice between murdering and allowing two people to die,\nit is clear that you should murder. After all, other things being\nequal, the situation is stacked 2-to-1 \u2014 there are two deaths on\none side, but only one death on the other, and each death is equally\nbad.\n\nConsequentialists who hold that killings of innocents are\nintrinsically bad can avoid this prediction. As long as a murder is at\nleast twice as bad as an ordinary death not by murder,\nconsequentialists can explain why you ought not to murder, even in\norder to prevent two deaths. So there is no in-principle problem for\nconsequentialism posed by this sort of example; whether it is an issue\nfor a given consequentialist depends on her axiology: on what she\nthinks is intrinsically bad, and how bad she thinks it is.\n\nBut the problem is very closely related to a genuine problem for\nconsequentialism. What if you could prevent two murders by murdering?\nPostulating an intrinsic disvalue to murders does nothing to account\nfor the intuition that you still ought not to murder, even in this\ncase. But most people find it pre-theoretically natural to assume that\neven if you should murder in order to prevent thousands of murders,\nyou shouldn\u2019t do it in order to prevent just two. The constraint\nagainst murdering, on this natural intuition, goes beyond the idea\nthat murders are bad. It requires that the badness of your own murders\naffects what you should do more than it affects what others should do\nin order to prevent you from murdering. That is why it is called\n\u201cagent-centered\u201d.\n3.3.2 Agent-Relative Value\n\nThe problem with agent-centered constraints is that there seems to be\nno single natural way of evaluating outcomes that yields all of the\nright predictions. For each agent, there is some way of evaluating\noutcomes that yields the right predictions about what she ought to do,\nbut these rankings treat that agent\u2019s murders as contributing\nmore to the badness of outcomes than other agents\u2019 murders. So\nas a result, an incompatible ranking of outcomes appears to be\nrequired in order to yield the right predictions about what some other\nagent ought to do \u2014 namely, one which rates his murders\nas contributing more to the badness of outcomes than the first\nagent\u2019s murders. (The situation is slightly more complicated\n\u2014 Oddie and Milne [1991] prove that under pretty minimal\nassumptions there is always some agent-neutral ranking that\nyields the right consequentialist predictions, but their proof does\nnot show that this ranking has any independent plausibility, and Nair\n[2014] argues that it cannot be an independently plausible account of\nwhat is a better outcome.)\n\nAs a result of this observation, philosophers have postulated a thing\ncalled agent-relative value. The idea of agent-relative value\nis that if the better than relation is relativized to\nagents, then outcomes in which Franz murders can be\nworse-relative-to Franz than outcomes in which Jens murders,\neven though outcomes in which Jens murders are worse-relative-to Jens\nthan outcomes in which Franz murders. These contrasting rankings of\nthese two kinds of outcomes are not incompatible, because each is\nrelativized to a different agent \u2014 the former to Franz, and the\nlatter to Jens.\n\nThe idea of agent-relative value is attractive to teleologists,\nbecause it allows a view that is very similar in structure to\nclassical consequentialism to account for constraints. According to\nthis view, sometimes called Agent-Relative Teleology or\nAgent-Centered Consequentialism, each agent ought always to do\nwhat will bring about the results that are best-relative-to her. Such\na view can easily accommodate an agent-centered constraint not to\nmurder, on the assumption that each agent\u2019s murders are\nsufficiently worse-relative-to her than other agent\u2019s murders\nare (Sen [1983], Portmore [2007]).\n\nSome philosophers have claimed that Agent-Relative Teleology is not\neven a distinct theory from classical consequentialism, holding that\nthe word \u201cgood\u201d in English picks out agent-relative value\nin a context-dependent way, so that when consequentialists say,\n\u201ceveryone ought to do what will have the best results\u201d,\nwhat they are really saying is that \u201ceveryone ought to do what\nwill have the best-relative-to-her results\u201d (Smith [2003]). And\nother philosophers have suggested that Agent-Relative Teleology is\nsuch an attractive theory that everyone is really committed to it\n(Dreier [1996]). These theses are bold claims in the theory of value,\nbecause they tell us strong and surprising things about the nature of\nwhat we are talking about, when we use the word,\n\u201cgood\u201d.\n3.3.3 Problems and Prospects\n\nIn fact, it is highly controversial whether there is even such a thing\nas agent-relative value in the first place. Agent-Relative\nTeleologists typically appeal to a distinction between agent-relative\nand agent-neutral value, but others have contested that no one has\never successfully made such a distinction in a theory-neutral way\n(Schroeder [2007]). Moreover, even if there is such a distinction,\nrelativizing \u201cgood\u201d to agents is not sufficient to deal\nwith all intuitive cases of constraints, because common sense allows\nthat you ought not to murder, even in order to prevent yourself\nfrom murdering twice in the future. In order to deal with such cases,\n\u201cgood\u201d will need to be relativized not just to agents, but\nto times (Brook [1991]). Yet a further source of difficulties\narises for views according to which \u201cgood\u201d in English is\nused to make claims about agent-relative value in a context-dependent\nway; such views fail ordinary tests for context-dependence, and\ndon\u2019t always generate the readings of sentences which their\nproponents require.\n\nOne of the motivations for thinking that there must be such a thing as\nagent-relative value comes from proponents of Fitting Attitudes\naccounts of value, and goes like this: if the good is what ought to be\ndesired, then there will be two kinds of good. What ought to be\ndesired by everyone will be the \u201cagent-neutral\u201d good, and\nwhat ought to be desired by some particular person will be the good\nrelative-to that person. Ancestors of this idea can be found in\nSidgwick and Ewing, and it has found a number of contemporary\nproponents. Whether it is right will turn not only on whether Fitting\nAttitudes accounts turn out to be correct, but on what role the answer\nto the questions, \u201cwho ought?\u201d or \u201cwhose\nreasons?\u201d plays in the shape of an adequate Fitting Attitudes\naccount. All of these issues remain unresolved.\n\nThe questions of whether there is such a thing as agent-relative\nvalue, and if so, what role it might play in an agent-centered variant\non classical consequentialism, are at the heart of the debate between\nconsequentialists and deontologists, and over the fundamental question\nof the relative priority of the evaluative versus the deontic. These\nare large and open questions, but as I hope I\u2019ve illustrated\nhere, they are intimately interconnected with a very wide range of\nboth traditional and non-traditional questions in the theory of value,\nbroadly construed.\n",
