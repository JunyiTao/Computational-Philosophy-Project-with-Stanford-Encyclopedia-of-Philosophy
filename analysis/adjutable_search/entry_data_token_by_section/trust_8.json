    "main_text": "The Value of Trust\n3. The Value of Trust\n\nSomeone who asks, \u201cWhen is trust warranted?\u201d might be\ninterested in knowing what the point of trust is. In other words, what\nvalue does it have? Although the value it has for particular people\nwill depend on their circumstances, the value it could have for anyone\nwill depend on why trust is valuable, generally speaking. Trust can\nhave enormous instrumental value and may also have some intrinsic\nvalue. In discussing its instrumental value, this section refers to\nthe \u201cgoods of trust\u201d, which can benefit the trustor, the\ntrustee, or society in general. They are therefore social and/or\nindividual goods. What is more and as emphasized throughout, these\ngoods tend to accompany justified trust, rather than any old\n trust.[14]\n Like the other sections of this entry, this one focuses predominantly\nthough not exclusively on trust; it also mentions recent work on the\nvalue of distrust.\n\nConsider first the possibility that trust has intrinsic value. If\ntrust produced no goods independent of it, would there be any point in\ntrusting? One might say \u201cyes\u201d, on the grounds that trust\nis (or can be; O\u2019Neil 2012: 311) a sign of respect for others.\n(Similarly, distrust is a sign of disrespect; D\u2019Cruz 2019.) If\ntrue, this fact about trust would make it intrinsically worthwhile, at\nleast so long as the trust is justified. Presumably, if it was\nunjustified, then the respect would be misplaced and the intrinsic\nvalue would be lost. But these points are speculative, since\nphilosophers have said comparatively little about trust being\nworthwhile in itself as opposed to worthwhile because of what it\nproduces, or because of what accompanies it. The discussion going\nforward centers on the latter, more specifically on the goods of\ntrust.\n\nTurning first to the instrumental value of trust to the\ntrustor, some argue that trusting vastly increases our\nopportunities for cooperating with others and for benefiting from that\ncooperation, although of course we would only benefit if people we\ntrusted cooperated as well (Gambetta 1988b; Hardin 2002; Dimock 2020).\nTrust enhances cooperation, while perhaps not being necessary for it\n(Cook et al. 2005; Skyrms 2008). Because trust removes the incentive\nto check up on other people, it makes cooperation with trust less\ncomplicated than cooperation without it (Luhmann 1973/1975\n[1979]).\n\nTrust can make cooperation possible, rather than simply easier, if\ntrust is essential to promising. Daniel Friedrich and Nicholas\nSouthwood defend what they call the \u201cTrust View\u201d of\npromissory obligation (2011), according to which \u201cmaking a\npromise involves inviting another individual to trust one to do\nsomething\u201d (2011: 277). If this view is correct, then\ncooperation through promising is impossible without trust. Cooperation\nof this sort will also not be fruitful unless the trust is\njustified.\n\nTrusting provides us with goods beyond those that come with\ncooperation, although again, for these goods to materialize, the trust\nmust be justified. Sometimes, trust involves little or no cooperation,\nso that the trustor is completely dependent on the trustee while the\nreverse is not true. Examples are the trust of young children in their\nparents and the trust of severely ill or disabled people in their care\nproviders. Trust is particularly important for these people because\nthey tend to be powerless to exercise their rights or to enforce any\nkind of contract. The trust they place in their care providers also\ncontributes to them being vulnerable, and so it is essential that they\ncan trust these people (i.e., that their trust is justified). The\ngoods at stake for them are all the goods involved in having a good or\ndecent life.\n\nAmong the specific goods that philosophers associate with trusting are\nmeaningful relationships or attachments (rather than simply\ncooperative relationships that further individual self-interests;\nHarding 2011, Kirton forthcoming) as well as knowledge and\n autonomy.[15]\n To expand, trust allows for the kinds of secure attachments that some\ndevelopmental psychologists (\u201cattachment\u201d theorists)\nbelieve are crucial to our well-being and to our ability to be\ntrusting of others (Bowlby 1969\u20131980; Ainsworth 1969; see Kirton\n2020; Wonderly 2016). Particularly important here are parent-child\nrelationships (McLeod et al. 2019).\n\nTrust is also crucial for knowledge, given that scientific knowledge\n(Hardwig 1991), moral knowledge (Jones 1999), and almost all knowledge\nin fact (Webb 1993) depends for its acquisition on trust in the\ntestimony of others. The basic argument for the need to trust what\nothers say is that no one person has the time, intellect, and\nexperience necessary to independently learn facts about the world that\nmany of us do know. Examples include the scientific fact that the\nearth is round, the moral fact that the oppression of people from\nsocial groups different from our own can be severe (Jones 1999), and\nthe mundane fact that we were born on such-in-such a day (Webb 1993:\n261). Of course, trusting the people who testify to these facts could\nonly generate knowledge if the trust was justified. If we were told\nour date of birth by people who were determined oddly to deceive us\nabout when we were born, then we would not know when we were born.\n\nAutonomy is another good that flows from trust insofar as people\nacquire or exercise autonomy only in social environments where they\ncan trust people (or institutions, etc.) to support their autonomy.\nFeminists in particular tend to conceive of autonomy this\nway\u2014that is, as a relational property (Mackenzie and Stoljar\n2000). Many feminists emphasize that oppressive social environments\ncan inhibit autonomy, and some say explicitly that conditions\nnecessary for autonomy (e.g., adequate options, knowledge relevant to\none\u2019s decisions) exist only with the help of people or\ninstitutions that are trustworthy (e.g., Oshana 2014; McLeod and Ryman\n2020). Justified trust in others to ensure that these conditions exist\nis essential for our autonomy, if autonomy is indeed\n relational.[16]\n\nGoods of trust that are instrumental to the well-being of the\ntrustee also do not materialize unless the trust is\njustified. Trust can improve the self-respect and moral maturity of\nthis person. Particularly if it involves reliance on a person\u2019s\nmoral character, trust can engender self-respect in the trustee (i.e.,\nthrough them internalizing the respect signaled by that trust). Being\ntrusted can allow us to be more respectful not only toward ourselves\nbut also toward others, thus enhancing our moral maturity. The\nexplicit goal of therapeutic trust is precisely to bring about this\nend. The above\n (section 2)\n suggests that therapeutic trust can be justified in a truth-directed\nway over time, provided that the trust has its intended effect of\nmaking the trustee more trustworthy (McGeer 2008; Baker 1987: 12).\nClearly, for therapeutic trust to benefit the trustee, it would have\nto be justified in this way, meaning that the therapy would normally\nhave to work.\n\nFinally, there are social goods of trust that are linked with the\nindividual goods of cooperation and moral maturity. The former goods\ninclude the practice of morality, the very existence of society\nperhaps, as well as strong social networks. Morality itself is a\ncooperative activity, which can only get off the ground if people can\ntrust one another to try, at least, to be moral. For this reason,\namong others, Baier claims that trust is \u201cthe very basis of\nmorality\u201d (2004: 180). It could also be the very basis of\nsociety, insofar as trust in our fellow citizens to honor social\ncontracts makes those contracts possible.\n\nA weaker claim is that trust makes society better or more livable.\nSome argue that trust is a form of \u201csocial capital\u201d,\nmeaning roughly that it enables \u201cpeople to work together for\ncommon purposes in groups and organizations\u201d (Fukuyama 1995: 10;\nquoted in Hardin 2002: 83). As a result, \u201chigh-trust\u201d\nsocieties have stronger economies and stronger social networks in\ngeneral than \u201clow-trust\u201d societies (Fukuyama 1995;\nInglehart 1999). Of course, this fact about high-trust societies could\nonly be true if, on the whole, the trust within them was\njustified\u2014that is, if trustees tended not to\n\u201cdefect\u201d and destroy chances for cooperating in the\nfuture.\n\nThe literature on distrust suggests that there are goods associated\nwith it too. For example, there is the social good discussed by\nKrishnamurthy of \u201csecuring democracy by protecting political\nminorities from tyranny\u201d (2015: 392). Distrust as she\nunderstands it (a confident belief that others will not act justly)\nplays this positive role when it is justified, which is roughly when\nthe threat of tyranny or unjust action is real. Distrust in general is\nvaluable when it is justified\u2014for the distrustors at least, who\nprotect themselves from harm. By contrast, the people distrusted tend\nto experience negative effects on their reputation or self-respect\n(D\u2019Cruz 2019).\n\nBoth trust and distrust are therefore valuable particularly when they\nare justified. The value of justified trust must be very high if\nwithout it, we can\u2019t have morality or society and can\u2019t be\nmorally mature, autonomous, knowledgeable, or invested with\nopportunities for collaborating with others. Justified distrust is\nalso essential, for members of minority groups especially. Conversely,\ntrust or distrust that is unjustified can be seriously problematic.\nUnjustified trust, for example, can leave us open to abuse, terror,\nand deception.\n",
