    "main_text": "Diodorus Cronus and Philo the Logician\n4. Diodorus Cronus and Philo the Logician\n\n\nIn the later 4th to mid 3rd centuries BCE,\ncontemporary with Theophrastus and Eudemus, a loosely connected group\nof philosophers, sometimes referred to as dialecticians (see entry\n\u2018Dialectical School\u2019) and possibly influenced by\nEubulides, conceived of logic as a logic of propositions. Their best\nknown exponents were Diodorus Cronus and his pupil Philo (sometimes\ncalled \u2018Philo of Megara\u2019). Although no writings of theirs\nare preserved, there are a number of later reports of their\ndoctrines. They each made groundbreaking contributions to the\ndevelopment of propositional logic, in particular to the theories of\nconditionals and modalities.\n\n\nA conditional (sun\u00eammenon) was considered a\nnon-simple proposition composed of two propositions and the connecting\nparticle \u2018if\u2019. Philo, who may be credited with introducing\ntruth-functionality into logic, provided the following criterion for\ntheir truth: A conditional is false when and only\nwhen its antecedent is true and its consequent is false, and\nit is true in the three remaining truth-value combinations. The\nPhilonian conditional resembles material implication, except\nthat\u2014since propositions were conceived of as functions of time\nthat can have different truth-values at different times\u2014it may\nchange its truth-value over time. For Diodorus, a conditional\nproposition is true if it neither was nor is possible that its\nantecedent is true and its consequent false. The temporal elements in\nthis account suggest that the possibility of a truth-value change in\nPhilo\u2019s conditionals was meant to be improved on. With his own modal\nnotions (see below) applied, a conditional is Diodorean-true now if\nand only if it is Philonian-true at all times. Diodorus\u2019 conditional\nis thus reminiscent of strict implication. Philo\u2019s and Diodorus\u2019\nconceptions of conditionals lead to variants of the\n\u2018paradoxes\u2019 of material and strict implication\u2014a\nfact the ancients were aware of (Sextus Empiricus [S. E.] M.\n8.109\u2013117).\n\n\nPhilo and Diodorus each considered the four modalities possibility,\nimpossibility, necessity and non-necessity. These were conceived of as\nmodal properties or modal values of propositions, not as modal\noperators. Philo defined them as follows: \u2018Possible is that\nwhich is capable of being true by the proposition\u2019s own nature\n\u2026 necessary is that which is true, and which, as far as it is\nin itself, is not capable of being false. Non-necessary is that which\nas far as it is in itself, is capable of being false, and impossible\nis that which by its own nature is not capable of being true.\u2019\nDiodorus\u2019 definitions were these: \u2018Possible is that which either\nis or will be [true]; impossible that which is false and will\nnot be true; necessary that which is true and will not be false;\nnon-necessary that which either is false already or will be\nfalse.\u2019 Both sets of definitions satisfy the following standard\nrequirements of modal logic: (i) necessity entails truth and truth\nentails possibility; (ii) possibility and impossibility are\ncontradictories, and so are necessity and non-necessity; (iii)\nnecessity and possibility are interdefinable; (iv) every proposition\nis either necessary or impossible or both possible and\nnon-necessary. Philo\u2019s definitions appear to introduce mere conceptual\nmodalities, whereas with Diodorus\u2019 definitions, some propositions may\nchange their modal value (Boeth. In Arist. De Int., sec. ed.,\n234\u2013235 Meiser).\n\n\nDiodorus\u2019 definition of possibility rules out future contingents and\nimplies the counterintuitive thesis that only the actual is\npossible. Diodorus tried to prove this claim with his famous Master\nArgument, which sets out to show the incompatibility of (i)\n\u2018every past truth is necessary\u2019, (ii) \u2018the\nimpossible does not follow from the possible\u2019, and (iii)\n\u2018something is possible which neither is nor will be true\u2019\n(Epict. Diss. II.19). The argument has not survived, but\nvarious reconstructions have been suggested. Some affinity with the\narguments for logical determinism in Aristotle\u2019s De\nInterpretatione 9 is likely.\n\n\nOn the topic of ambiguity, Diodorus held that no linguistic expression\nis ambiguous. He supported this dictum by a theory of meaning based on\nspeaker intention. Speakers generally intend to say only one thing\nwhen they speak. What is said when they speak is what they intend to\nsay. Any discrepancy between speaker intention and listener decoding\nhas its cause in the obscurity of what was said, not its ambiguity\n(Aulus Gellius 11.12.2\u20133).\n",
