    "main_text": "Theory of Knowledge || Analogic Knowledge\n4.2 Analogic Knowledge\n\nTaken as a whole, the process of knowledge in Llull includes several\nsteps that, even if they have a sequence of ascent and descent, form a\ncircle which can be traversed in both directions. This process would\nbegin, as was previously stated, with self-knowledge. Initially man\nwould use his intellect to understand his own dynamism (Petit 2004),\nand in that process he will find the principles whose\nsimilarities\u2014goodness, greatness, etc.\u2014he will look for in\nthe sensible things as he descends.\n\nFrom this descending move, an ascending one will follow, through which\nthe intrinsic species are deduced from the extrinsic\nspecies. The process would end in a final intellectual move that\nL\u00f3pez Alcaide (2015) describes as horizontal, in which the\nintellect, by considering the goodness of the senses, will consider\nthe goodness of the intellect itself, thus reaching goodness in\nitself.\n\nThrough this process of concatenating the similarities of external\nobjects with the internal principles of understanding, man realizes\nwhat the structure of creation is, as well as its order, the mutual\nparticipation and influence among beings, and among the principles and\nthe dignities.\n\nIn this sense, knowledge in Llull consists of perceiving and\nunderstanding the meanings revealed by the objects found in the divine\nattributes. As Petit (2004: 219) observes, according to Llull, knowing\n\u201cis the result not only of seeing, feeling or touching, but also\ncontemplating\u201d.\n",
