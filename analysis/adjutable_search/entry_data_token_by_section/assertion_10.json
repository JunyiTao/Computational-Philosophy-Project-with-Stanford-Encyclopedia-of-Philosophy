    "main_text": "Descriptive Accounts, Hearer-Directed || Self-representation\n4.1 Self-representation\n\nAccording to Frege (1918a [TFR: 329]), as noted, an assertion is an\noutward sign of a judgment (Urteil). The term\n\u201cjudgment\u201d has been used in several ways. If it is used to\nmean either belief, or act by which a belief is formed or\nreinforced, then Frege\u2019s view is pretty close to the view\nthat assertion is the expression of belief.\n\nThis idea, that assertion is the expression of belief, has a longer\nhistory, going back to at least Kant. How should one understand the\nidea of expressing here? It is natural to think of a belief state,\nthat is, a mental state of the speaker, as causally co-responsible for\nthe making of the assertion. The speaker has a belief and wants to\ncommunicate it, which motivates an assertoric utterance. But what\nabout the cases when the speaker does not believe what he asserts? Can\nwe still say, even of insincere assertions, that they express belief?\nIf so, in what sense?\n\nWithin the communicative intentions tradition, Bach and Harnish have\nemphasized that an assertion gives the hearer evidence for\nthe corresponding belief, and that what is common to the sincere and\ninsincere case is the intention of providing such evidence:\n\n\nFor S to express an attitude is for S to\nR-intend the hearer to take S\u2019s utterance as\nreason to think S has that attitude. (Bach & Harnish\n1979: 15, italics in the original)\n\n\n(\u2018R-intend\u2019 is, as above, short for \u201creflexively\nintend\u201d). On this view, expressing is wholly a matter of\nhearer-directed intentions.\n\nThis proposal has the advantage of covering both the sincere and the\ninsincere case, but has the drawback of requiring a high level of\nsophistication. By contrast, Bernard Williams (2002: 74) has claimed\nthat a sincere assertion is simply the direct expression of\nbelief, in a more primitive and unsophisticated way. Insincere\nassertions are different. According to Williams (2002: 74), in an\nassertion, the speaker either gives a direct expression of\nbelief, or he intends the addressee to \u201ctake it\u201d\nthat he has the belief (cf. Owens 2006).\n\nPresumably, the intention mentioned is an intention about what the\nhearer is to believe about the speaker. In this case the objection\nthat too much sophistication is required is less pressing, since it\nonly concerns insincere assertions. However, Williams\u2019s idea (as\nin Grice 1969) has the opposite defect of not taking more\nsophistication into account. The idea, that the alternative to\nsincerity is the intention to make the hearer believe that the speaker\nbelieves what he asserts, is not general enough. For instance, there\nis double bluffing, where the speaker asserts what is true in order to\ndeceive the hearer, whom the speaker believes will expect the speaker\nto lie. Again, an insincere speaker S who asserts that\np may know that the hearer A knows that\nS does not believe that p, but may still intend to\nmake A believe that S does not know about\nA\u2019s knowledge, precisely by making the assertion that\np. There is no definitive upper limit to the sophistication\nof the deceiving speaker\u2019s calculations. In addition, the\nspeaker may simply be stonewalling, reiterating an assertion without\nany hope of convincing the addressee of anything.\n\nA more neutral way of trying to capture the relation between assertion\nand believing was suggested both by Max Black (1952) and by Davidson\n(1984: 268): in asserting that p the speaker\nrepresents herself as believing that p. This\nsuggestion appears to avoid the difficulties with the appeal to\nhearer-directed intentions.\n\nA somewhat related approach is taken by Mitchell S. Green (2007), who\nappeals to \u201cexpressive conventions\u201d. Grammatical moods can\nhave such conventions (2007: 150). According to Green (2007: 160), an\nassertion that p invokes a set of conventions according to\nwhich the speaker \u201ccan be represented as bearing the\nbelief-relation to p\u201d.\n\nAs one can represent oneself as believing, one can also represent\noneself as knowing. Inspired by Davidson\u2019s proposal, Peter Unger\n(1975: 253\u2013270) and Michael Slote (1979: 185) made the stronger\nclaim that in asserting that p the speaker represents\nherself as knowing that p. To a small extent this idea had been\nanticipated by G. E. Moore when claiming that the speaker\nimplies that she knows that p (1912 [1966: 63]).\n\nHowever, it is not so clear what representing oneself amounts to. It\nmust be a sense different from that in which one represents the\nworld as having certain features. The speaker who asserts\n\n(23)\nThere are black swans.\n\n\ndoes not also claim that she believes that there are black\nswans. It must apparently be some weaker sense of\n\u201crepresent\u201d, since it is not just a matter of\nbeing, as opposed to not being, fully explicit. If I am asked what I\nbelieve and I answer by uttering\n (23),\n I do represent myself as believing that there are black swans, just\nas I would have done by explicitly saying that I believe that\nthere are black swans. I do represent myself as believing that there\nare black swans, equivalently with asserting that I do. What I assert\nthen is false if I don\u2019t have the belief, despite the existence\nof black swans.\n\nOn the other hand, it must also be stronger than the sense of\n\u201crepresent\u201d by which an actor can be said to represent\nhimself as believing something on stage. The actor says\n\n(24)\nI\u2019m in the biology department.\n\n\nthereby representing himself as asserting that he is in the biology\ndepartment, since he represents himself as being a man who honestly\nasserts that he is in the biology department. By means of that, he in\none sense represents himself as believing that he is in the biology\ndepartment. But the audience not invited to believe that the\nspeaker, that is, the actor, has that belief.\n\nApparently, the relevant sense of \u201crepresent\u201d is not easy\nto specify. That it nevertheless tracks a real phenomenon is often\nclaimed to be shown by Moore\u2019s Paradox. This is the paradox that\nassertoric utterances of sentences such as\n\n(25)\nIt is raining but I don\u2019t believe that it is raining.\n\n\n(the omissive type of Moorean sentences) are distinctly odd, and even\nprima facie self-defeating, despite the fact that they may\nwell be true. Among the different types of account of Moore\u2019s\nParadox, Moore\u2019s own emphasizes the connection between asserting\nand believing. Moore\u2019s idea (1944: 175\u2013176; 1912 [1966:\n63]) was that the speaker in some sense implies that she\nbelieves what she asserts. So by asserting\n (25)\n the speaker induces a contradiction between what she asserts and what\nshe implies. This contradiction is then supposed to explain the\n oddity.[16]\n",
