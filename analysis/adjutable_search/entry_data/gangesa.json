    "preamble": "\n\nGa\u1e45ge\u015ba, the \u201cGreat Professor\u201d\n(mah\u00f4p\u0101dhy\u0101ya), lived in the fourteenth\ncentury in northeastern India. In Sanskrit, he wrote a philosophic\nmasterpiece called the \u201cJewel\u201d solidifying\nseveral centuries of advances in epistemology and logic within the\nclassical school of \u201cLogic,\u201d Ny\u0101ya. By all counts,\nGa\u1e45ge\u015ba is one of the major figures not only in\nNy\u0101ya but in the whole long and complex history of classical\nphilosophy. Ga\u1e45ge\u015ba is traditionally taken to inaugurate\n\u201cNew\u201d Logic, Navya Ny\u0101ya. However, the\ndistinction between \u201cOld\u201d and \u201cNew\u201d Ny\u0101ya\nis problematic, since over the tradition\u2019s almost\ntwo-thousand-year history there are both numerous developments and\nsolid lines of continuity. At no time is there a decisive revolution,\nnot with Ga\u1e45ge\u015ba, and also not with Udayana, the\neleventh-century Naiy\u0101yika whom Ga\u1e45ge\u015ba follows more\nclosely than any other thinker and whom scholars sometimes identify as\nthe originator of Navya Ny\u0101ya. However, Ny\u0101ya\u2019s\nmethods of investigation and argumentation on a wide range of topic,\nand against opponents\u2019 views\u2014Buddhists in the early years,\nothers later\u2014do indeed become increasingly refined, and\nGa\u1e45ge\u015ba\u2019s work can in several ways be counted\npivotal.\n\nNy\u0101ya is a multi-dimensional system of interlocking views that\nbelies the stereotype of Indian philosophy as idealist and mystical in\norientation. The school\u2019s founding text is the\nNy\u0101ya-s\u016btra (c. 100 CE), which had elicited tomes\nof commentary long before Ga\u1e45ge\u015ba. Ny\u0101ya is broadly\nrealist about objects talked about and experienced everyday.\nGa\u1e45ge\u015ba advances what may be called a reliabilist theory of\nknowledge and justification, indeed a super-reliabilism, an\ninfallibilism for externalists in the sense that sources of\nknowledge\u2014perception, inference, analogy, and testimony, his\nmain focus\u2014are conceived factively. Among his most major\naccomplishments are definitions of knowledge in general and of natural\n\u201cpervasions\u201d as underpinning inference as well as analyses\nof conditions governing meaning in knowledge-transfers through\ntestimony. He is also known for crisp treatments of the major types of\nfallacy and epistemic defeater. Ga\u1e45ge\u015ba presents, defending\nin long passages, (a) an argument for a self as a special type of\nsubstance, (b) a theistic argument that illustrates his theory of\ndebate and reasoning in great detail, and (c) a defense of the\npossibility of \u201cliberation,\u201d mukti, that both\nenlivens the views of very early Ny\u0101ya\u2014in particular\nV\u0101tsy\u0101yana (c. 400 CE)\u2014and becomes influential in\nseveral other traditions and schools. Ny\u0101ya itself has a lively\nliterature that extends to the modern period and, among the\ntraditionally learned, to our own day.\n",

    "main_text": "\n1. Historical particulars\n\nGa\u1e45ge\u015ba lived in the first half of the fourteenth century,\nin Mithil\u0101, in northeastern India, where he was a prominent\nteacher, both of Ny\u0101ya, including logic and critical reasoning,\nand of M\u012bm\u0101\u1e43s\u0101, the school known for Vedic\ninterpretation and ritual. Ga\u1e45ge\u015ba endorses Ny\u0101ya in\nhis Jewel, but he was also a great master of\nM\u012bm\u0101\u1e43s\u0101. M\u012bm\u0101\u1e43s\u0101 is a\nlong-running tradition which, like Ny\u0101ya, pronounces on almost\nevery topic imaginable, along with Vedic ritual, the school\u2019s\nspecialization, as Ny\u0101ya\u2019s is critical reasoning.\nGa\u1e45ge\u015ba knew well M\u012bm\u0101\u1e43saka positions in\nboth of its major branches, the Bh\u0101\u1e6d\u1e6da (after\nKum\u0101rila Bha\u1e6d\u1e6da of the seventh century), and the\nPr\u0101bh\u0101kara (after Kum\u0101rila\u2019s renegade student,\nPrabh\u0101kara). And Ga\u1e45ge\u015ba may be supposed to have\nlearned the standard curricula in the grammarian literature, the epic\npoems, etc., some of which he cites, for example, P\u0101\u1e47ini\n(c. 500 BCE), and, in several places, the Bhagavad\nG\u012bt\u0101.\n\nBhattacharya cites data from literary and other sources, and in about\na dozen pages devoted to Ga\u1e45ge\u015ba (1958: 96\u2013109)\nprovides termini a quo et ad quem\u20141300 and 1350 for his\nperiod of flourishing\u2014from evidence that has not been corrected\nto date. Genealogical records kept in Mithil\u0101 suggest that he had\na wife and three sons and a daughter. One child was the famous\nNy\u0101ya author, Vardham\u0101na. Ga\u1e45ge\u015ba apparently\nachieved quite some fame during his lifetime, referred to as\n\u201cjagad-guru,\u201d which would be the rough equivalent\nof \u201cDistinguished University Professor\u201d for the\neducational institutions of his time.\n\nAbout the person little more is known. About\nGa\u1e45ge\u015ba\u2019s reputation, Bhattacharya says (1958: 109):\n\u201cThe work of Ga\u1e45ge\u015ba became highly popular very soon\nand was studied and commented upon in various centers of culture of\nIndia. It not only cast the works of the old school of logic into\noblivion but the neo-logical works of his predecessors also faded into\ninsignificance and were gradually were forgotten due to its\noverwhelming popularity and all-embracing character.\u201d Concerning\nthe part on inference, the learned sanskritist writes (1958: 107,\n108): \u201cThe second part on Anum\u0101na (Inference) is by far the\nmost popular, though the most intricate of the whole book. \u2026\nThe latest phase of Navyany\u0101ya studies in India for about two\ncenturies flowed through a large number of channels cut by single\nsentences or phrases of this part of Ga\u1e45ge\u015ba\u2019s work\nand by far the widest channel emerged from the general definition of\nFallacy. It has now assumed proportions through the efforts of all the\nbest Indian brains in Navyany\u0101ya, which is a world\u2019s wonder\nin the field of intellectual feats \u2026 .\u201d\n\nThe Jewel has four chapters, each devoted to a source of\nknowledge: perception, inference, analogy, and testimony. Within a\nchapter are clearly delineated sections on various subtopics including\nlong reflections, mainly in the first chapter, concerning knowledge in\ngeneral and how it is known. Ga\u1e45ge\u015ba is lucid and precise,\nleading the reader into a preferred position by careful examination of\nalternatives.\n2. Categories of possible referent in causal relationship\n\nGa\u1e45ge\u015ba\u2019s central focus is epistemology, not ontology\nor metaphysics, but his analyses rely on a centuries-old ontological\nsystem. In all four chapters of the Jewel, he addresses\nontological issues, especially the topics of universals and of the\nontological relation of qualification that is reflected in knowledge\nof something as qualified by a qualifier, \u201cThat\u2019s a\ncow,\u201d for instance, which would be an instance of knowledge of\nsomething qualified by the universal being-a-cow.\n\nThe system that Ga\u1e45ge\u015ba takes over is inherited in\nparticular from his \u201cteacher\u201d Udayana. In a dozen\ntreatises, Udayana merges the separate literature and worldview of\nVai\u015be\u1e63ika\u2014its advocates sometimes called\n\u201cAtomists\u201d \u2014with Ny\u0101ya\u2019s. Udayana also\nadded the category of absence to the\nVai\u015be\u1e63ika-s\u016btra\u2019s six, so that there\nare seven basic types of things possibly referred to in technical\nworks as in everyday life:\n\nSubstance: four atomic substances, earth, water, fire, and air\natoms and their combinations; a \u201cmaterial\u201d substance that\nis non-atomic, ether, the medium of sound; time; space; mind\n(manas); self (\u0101tman)\nQuality: properties that dwell in, qualifying substances such as\ncolor, weight, shape, and so on along with relational properties such\nas conjunction\nMotion: movements such as going-up which, like qualities, dwell in\nsubstances\nUniversals: recurrent properties, and meta-properties, that\nqualify qualities, blueness, for example, and motions, going-up-hood\nas a class characteristic, as well as substances, for example,\nearthenness and mountainhood\nIndividualizers: properties inherent in individual atoms and\nselves (individualizer is not a category discussed by\nGa\u1e45ge\u015ba)\nInherence: ontic glue binding qualities, motions, and universals\nto the things they qualify\nAbsence: four general types admitting further subdivisions and\ninnumerable instances: prior absence (the pot the potter contemplates\nbefore producing it in the clay, with the pot as the\n\u201ccounterpositive,\u201d i.e., what is absent), destruction (for\nexample, of a pot), mutual absence (the distinction of one thing from\nanother: a pot is not a cloth), and locatable (called\n\u201cabsolute,\u201d atyant\u00e2bh\u0101va, as a\npot\u2019s not being on the floor, or as my glasses not being on my\ndesk, where the glasses are the \u201ccounterpositive\u201d and the\ndesk the locus): \u2018\\(\\neg Ha\\)\u2019 means \\(H\\) is absent at\n\\(a\\), where \u201c\\(H\\)\u201d is the counterpositive to the absence\n(an absence of all pots on a floor would have pothood as the\ncounterpositive)\n\n\nThere are also properties and entities that do not fit very well into\nthe typology. Some philosophers after Ga\u1e45ge\u015ba rework the\nsystem, but Ga\u1e45ge\u015ba himself is ontologically conservative,\npresenting arguments for its expansion in various ways without\nendorsement.\n\nGa\u1e45ge\u015ba also inherits a causal schema that is crucial to\nhis causal theory of knowledge. Perception and the other sources\ngenerate knowledge instances, in the sense of being the\n\u201cchief instrumental cause.\u201d To understand this, we have to\nknow that there are most generally three varieties of cause-effect\nrelationship:\n\nInherent, as blue in a lotus, cowhood in cows\nCo-inherent, \u201cemergent,\u201d as the color of threads\ndetermining the color of a cloth\nInstrumental, including both agential causes, such as a potter for\na pot, and non-agential, such as the stick used to turn the wheel\n\n\nGa\u1e45ge\u015ba, like other Naiy\u0101yikas, also works with the\ndistinction between the necessary and the sufficient, sufficient\ncausality being a whole bundle of causal conditions, including general\nones such as time and space. A source of knowledge is a process of\nknowledge generation, and each has a distinct \u201ctrigger.\u201d A\ntrigger is that instrumental cause which, when all the other causal\nconditions necessary for an effect are in place, brings it about. The\ntrigger of perceptual knowledge is said to be connection of a sensory\norgan with an object to be known. The trigger of knowledge by\ninference is said to be reflection on a property of an object as\npervaded by\u2014invariably associated with\u2014another property,\nthe former called the prover\u2014the pervaded\u2014and the latter\nthe probandum\u2014the pervader. The trigger of testimonial knowledge\nis said to be the statement of a trustworthy expert as comprehended by\nthe hearer, a trustworthy expert being defined as someone who knows\nthe truth and wants to communicate it faithfully, without lying or\ndeceiving. Causal relations are especially important because knowledge\nof the occurrence of an effect allows the knower to infer any one or\nmore of its necessary conditions, as perception of smoke rising from a\nmountain allows one to infer fire. Furthermore, recognizing a\nparticular knowledge source by its trigger is one way to certify a\nresult, an instance of testimonial knowledge for instance.\n\nGa\u1e45ge\u015ba often utilizes a simpler ontological schema in his\nanalyses of the generation of knowledge: an instance of knowledge is\nabout, at a minimum, a qualifier-qualificandum, the hyphen\nstanding for the qualificative relation, also discussed, with\nqualificanda as property-bearers, anything we can talk about,\nincluding universals and supervenient properties such as similarity,\nand qualifiers as qualities or universals or even mind-imposed\nproperties that, as suggested, do not seem to have a place in the\ntraditional layout. No matter, we can deal with these later, seems to\nbe Ga\u1e45ge\u015ba\u2019s attitude, as he proceeds to focus on\nknowledge and its generators.\n\nGa\u1e45ge\u015ba\u2019s Ny\u0101ya embraces realism along several\ndimensions, realism in the sense of commitment to entities that exist\nindependently of consciousness. There are, however, exceptions in the\nproperties of a self along with some others that do require\nconsciousness to occur. Knowledge itself and other mental phenomena\nare counted as reals and knowable intersubjectively, for instance.\nRealism leads Naiy\u0101yikas to embrace fallibilism from very early,\nbecause the transcendence, so to say, of a physical object to the\ninstruments of knowledge is seen to mean that the possibility of error\ncannot be ruled out\u2014except in the case of apperception,\naccording to Ga\u1e45ge\u015ba (see below). The Jewel is\nfilled out with numerous definitional projects where the definienda\n(instances of knowledge, for example, as well as physical objects),\nare realities. And all individuals of whatever fundamental type\n(substance, quality, motion, universal, inherence, individuator, and\nabsence) are viewed as reals, although the mind can create fictions.\nAgainst Buddhist subjectivists, it is argued that the components of\nfalse and fictional awarenesses themselves indicate reals. Gold and\nmountains are real but maybe not a gold mountain. More about illusion\nand other instances of non-knowledge in practically every subsection\nbelow.\n3. Knowledge and certification\n\nThe target of epistemological evaluations in classical India is not\nbelief but rather cognition, which, however, like belief in the West,\nis viewed as propositional. Buddhists, Naiy\u0101yikas,\nM\u012bm\u0101\u1e43sakas, and others address the issue of how a\nproposition-laden cognition is known to be true, or false, for that\nmatter. Against M\u012bm\u0101\u1e43sakas in particular,\nGa\u1e45ge\u015ba advances an \u201cextrinsicality\u201d position.\nAlthough presumptive presentations of \u201cfresh news\u201d through\nany of the sources\u2014perception and the others\u2014are naturally\nand automatically taken to be veridical, according to\nGa\u1e45ge\u015ba\u2019s Ny\u0101ya, it takes a separate cognitive\nact to determine whether a cognition is knowledge or\n\u201cnon-knowledge.\u201d An awareness, an \u201cexperience\u201d\n(anubhava, a term used technically in the system), defined as\nwhat a person takes to be presentation of news\u2014i.e., takes\nautomatically to be new information\u2014is presumptively knowledge\nbut on occasion is either false or not produced by a genuine knowledge\nsource, perception, inference, or testimony (analogy is, for\nGa\u1e45ge\u015ba, restricted to learning the meaning of words).\nAccording to M\u012bm\u0101\u1e43s\u0101, certification is intrinsic\nto the apparent presentation. Ga\u1e45ge\u015ba\u2019s refutation\ncenters on an alleged phenomenology of doubt and knowing that one\nknows. If the M\u012bm\u0101\u1e43saka position were correct, it\nwould not be possible to doubt the veridicality of, for example, a\nperception that is indeed an instance of knowledge, both veridical and\nproduced in the right way. But it is possible, he says.\n\nCertification happens through source identification, and the sources\nare known mainly by inference from certain tell-tale signs called\n\u201cmerits,\u201d gu\u1e47a, while falsification occurs\nthrough recognizing tell-tale signs of pseudo-sources called\n\u201cflaws,\u201d do\u1e63a. Various fallacies, for\nexample, are flaws with respective to putative knowledge as determined\nby way of inference. In certain cases, however, in contrast to the\nnorm, there is practically self-certification, as the\nM\u012bm\u0101\u1e43sakas claim. For example, perception is like that\nwith knowing that there is a small piece of \u0101malaka\nfruit in the palm of your hand. Much discussion throughout the\nJewel centers on certification conditions, some of which\nfigure in the definitions of the several sources. There is also much\nconcern with specification of the trigger, or triggers, of the\nworkings of the sources, which not only can serve to define them but\nwhose identification is one way certification proceeds.\n3.1 Awareness as presumptively knowledge\n\nThe processes of perception, inference, analogy, and testimony\ngenerate \u201cawareness,\u201d anubhava, a technical term,\nas mentioned, meaning \u201cpresentation of fresh news.\u201d No\nnon-veridical awarenesses are produced from the sources, but there are\nof course occasions when we are fooled. There are pseudo-sources,\nprocesses closely resembling the true ones, but flawed in some way and\ngenerating wrong results. Consonantly, there are awarenesses that at\nthe time we take to be telling us something true in the usual\nfashions\u2014by perception and the rest\u2014but are actually false\nor not produced correctly. These are instances of\n\u201cnon-knowledge,\u201d apram\u0101, contrasting with\npram\u0101, \u201cknowledge,\u201d entailing truth and\nright production.\n\nPragmatic considerations reinforce our natural tendency to take the\ndeliverances of the sources to be veridical. We couldn\u2019t get\nalong in the world without knowledge, as Naiy\u0101yikas as early as\nV\u0101tsy\u0101yana stress (1996: 2). This is a recurrent theme.\nGa\u1e45ge\u015ba relies on \u201cpragmatic contradiction\u201d to\nrefute a skeptic about inference in the Jewel\u2019s\n\u201cHypothetical Reasoning\u201d section (2020: 647\u201351):\n\n\nWhen there is doubt, there is no regular pattern of behavior. When\nthere is a regular pattern, doubt does not occur. Thus it has been\nsaid (by Udayana): \u201cThat is doubted concerning which as doubted\nthere occurs no contradiction with the doubter\u2019s\naction.\u201d\n\nFor it is not possible at once to resort regularly to fire and the\nlike for smoke and the like and to doubt that fire causes it. This is\nhow we should understand the saying.\n\nThus we may reject the argument that contradiction\u2014understood as\nnatural opposition (virodha), governing precisely which F\ncannot occur along with precisely which G\u2014cannot block an\ninfinite regress. It is the doubter\u2019s own behavior that proves\nthe lie to the doubt, that blocks it (pratibandhaka).\n\n\nIt may be true that repeated observation (\u201ceven hundreds of\ntimes\u201d) is insufficient to guarantee knowledge of a pervasion\n(pervasions underpin the natural entailments on which inference\ndepends). Not all things made out of earth are scratchable by iron;\ndiamonds, recently discovered, are a counterexample. Defending\npervasion-knowledge nevertheless, Ga\u1e45ge\u015ba cites this case\nin admitting that the possibility of a counterexample cannot be\neliminated, at least generally speaking. But we do grasp pervasions,\nand often meaningful doubt can be done away with. Absolute freedom\nfrom doubt is not required to have knowledge. And knowledge guides\naction. We may be wrong in any particular case, but we act on the\nbasis of the regularities in nature we take ourselves to be aware of,\nautomatically making inferences producing knowledge.\n\nThe same goes for perception, analogy, and testimony. With testimony,\nfor example, we may be aware of a defeater, a speaker\u2019s being a\nliar, for instance, but in such a case we do not take ourselves to be\npresented with news. Perceptual and other awarenesses do not occur\nwhen blocked, when defeated in this way. A good example is the fallacy\ncalled b\u0101dhita, \u201cdefeated in advance.\u201d No\ninference purporting to show that fire is cold can be successful\nbecause we already know it\u2019s hot. But of course some defeaters\noccur to us only later, and for a time we are fooled. In the market,\nwe learn that the piece of shell we thought was silver is really only\nmother-of-pearl. Awarenesses are presumptively knowledge, but are also\ndefeasible. The exception concerns certain matters known by\napperception (see below), which, Ga\u1e45ge\u015ba argues, are known\nwithout the possibility of being wrong.\n\nIn sum, the defeasibility character of Ga\u1e45ge\u015ba\u2019s\ntheory of knowledge centers on the fact that apparently trustworthy\nsources of information at times mislead. But in those cases it is not\nreally the knowledge sources, perception, and the rest, that are at\nwork but rather close imitators. Knowledge sources\n(pram\u0101\u1e47a) themselves are inerrant. This makes the\nconcept of the apparent source central\n(pram\u0101\u1e47\u00e2bh\u0101sa): \u201cYou can't really\nsee John from this distance.\u201d Awareness naturally taken\nto be informative is presumptively true but the presumption can be\ndefeated. It can also be certified. Defeating and certifying belong to\na second-level of knowing where we are self-conscious about\njustification. But there, too, we give the benefit of the doubt,\nb\u0101dhakam vin\u0101, \u201cunless there is a\ndefeater.\u201d In this way there is no justification regress as\nfeared by Western foundationalists and alleged by the second-century\nBuddhist N\u0101g\u0101rjuna (1978).\n3.2 How knowledge is known\n\nIt is difficult to appreciate Ga\u1e45ge\u015ba\u2019s reflection on\ncertification without knowing something about the\nM\u012bm\u0101\u1e43saka positions, called in general\n\u201cself-certification,\u201d which he attacks. Self-certification\nis embraced also by Yog\u0101c\u0101ra Buddhist philosophers, but\nGa\u1e45ge\u015ba focuses mainly on the arguments of\nPr\u0101bh\u0101karas as voiced in particular by the ninth-century\nauthor \u015a\u0101likan\u0101tha (1961). It seems that\nM\u012bm\u0101\u1e43sakas would secure the authority of Vedic\ntestimony for rituals and various rules of everyday life effortlessly,\none suspects in overview, by maintaining that knowledge is\nself-certifying. Ga\u1e45ge\u015ba focuses, however, on perceptual\nknowledge, which, he maintains, can, in certain circumstances, both be\ndoubted and later certified as knowledge. \u201cI wouldn\u2019t now\nbe drinking water, if the awareness had not been knowledge. But I am\nnow drinking, satisfying my thirst, and the awareness was knowledge\nindeed\u201d (translator\u2019s comments, Jewel 2020: 109).\nIn this case, the certification comes by way of an inference. Source\nidentification is another way of capturing the point. It is by\ninference that one determines that an awareness-generating process is\nindeeed perception, perception that is factively conceived. A genuine\nsource never misleads. Only \u201cpseudo-sources\u201d do.\n\nThere are different signs whereby one knows that an instance of\ninferential knowledge is both true and produced in the right way. Do\nwe really know the premises, in particular the alleged\n\u201cpervasion,\u201d vy\u0101pti? For testimony,\ncertification conditions are the speaker\u2019s being a trustworthy\nexpert along with conditions governing what it is to be a proper\nstatement and of course certain hearer conditions (such as knowing the\nlanguage). And in certain cases there is, admittedly,\nself-certification. But the M\u012bm\u0101\u1e43sakas are wrong to\ntake that to be the general rule.\n4. Perception\n\nAs with the English word \u2018perception\u2019, the Sanskrit\n\u2018pratyak\u1e63a\u2019 so translated is used for both\nthe process of sensory connection with an object perceived and as the\nresultant awareness. In common Sanskrit, the word\n\u2018pratyak\u1e63a\u2019, etymologically \u201cbefore\nthe eyes,\u201d means something like \u201cexperientially\nevident\u201d when used as an adjective and \u201cimmediate\nexperience\u201d or \u201csense experience\u201d as a noun.\nInternal perceptions as of thought and emotion, pleasure and pain, and\nindeed of a \u201cself,\u201d \u0101tman, are considered in\nNy\u0101ya to be mediated by a \u201cmind\u201d or, in a better\ntranslation, an \u201cinternal organ,\u201d manas. A\nperception that targets a preceding perception or another cognition or\nmental event is given a special word,\n\u2018anuvyayas\u0101ya\u2019, \u201capperception,\u201d\nliterally an \u201cafter-cognition,\u201d a type of perception that\nis especially important in cross-school controversy. The internal\norgan, manas, also serves the function of channeling\ninformation from sense organs and bringing it together in perceptual\nknowledge for a self. Such a mental organ is denied by Buddhist\nadversaries and others in other schools, and is hotly debated within\nNy\u0101ya.\n4.1 Perception as producing knowledge\n\nThe processes of production of sensory awarness vary with modality and\nwith the type of thing perceived, earthen, watery, etc., universal or\nparticular, a group of things, something external or internal, and in\nways peculiar to perceivers. Neverthelesss, there are commonalities,\nespecially when it comes to the questions of epistemology, most\nprominently that innumerable instances of knowledge are sensorily\nproduced. But awareness produced by the senses is not how\nGa\u1e45ge\u015ba defines perceptual knowledge. If what was\nconsidered an instance of knowledge is discovered to be in fact a\nfalse belief, then we say in English that there was no knowledge in\nthe first place, only a belief that was considered true and warranted.\nThe same logic holds for Ga\u1e45ge\u015ba\u2019s\n\u2018pratyak\u1e63a\u2019: if what was considered a\nperceptual awareness is discovered to be in fact non-veridical, then\nit is said that there was no perception in the first place, only an\nawareness that was considered veridical and produced by an organ of\nsense.\n\nThus there may be here only a verbal unity achieved cheaply, but it is\nimportant to know that Ga\u1e45ge\u015ba works with this\nunderstanding of the term. Perhaps this is why he spends section after\nsection in his \u201cperception\u201d chapter examining particular\nproblems with objects known such as air, the sound of one\u2019s own\nson\u2019s voice in a \u201ctumultuous racket,\u201d universals and\nthe types of sensory relation occurrent in knowledge thereof, apparent\nsimultaneous perception, and perception of perception itself. His\nchapter is full of phenomenological insights, but the science he\nrelies on to understand the operations of the several sense organs is\nobviously antiquated. Epistemologically, however, the goal is to\nseparate the pseudo-source that generates non-knowledge (awareness\nthat appears to to be true but is not or is not produced in the\nassumed way) from the genuine, and the science is often not relevant\nconsidering the signs of knowledge and non-knowledge. The longest\nsection of the chapter is devoted to a general account of illusion as\n\u201cappearance of something as other than as it is,\u201d\nanyath\u0101-khy\u0101ti-v\u0101da.\n\nIn illusion, Ga\u1e45ge\u015ba says, the presentation of\nF-hood\u2014silverhood, for example, in the illusion of\n\u201cseeing\u201d a piece of shell as silver, and saying,\n\u201cSilver,\u201d when it\u2019s really\nmother-of-pearl\u2014originates in things\u2019 really being F,\nthrough previous knowledge of F-hood, real bits of silver in the\nworld. The silverhood predication in the verbalization of the\nperception-like experience is available to become illusory predication\ncontent through previous experience of silver. It gets fused into a\ncurrent perception-like event by means of a foul-up in the normal\ncausal process through the arousing of a silverhood memory-disposition\n(sa\u1e43sk\u0101ra) formed by previous experience of\nsilver, or, possibly, by testimony. The content or intentionality of\nan illusion is to be explained causally as generated by real features\nof real things just as is genuine perception although they are\ndistinct cognitive types. To repeat, genuine perception is factive;\nillusion is a perception-imitator (\u201cYou don\u2019t really see\nMaitra because that\u2019s Chaitra\u201d).\n\nPerception gets content not only from the object in connection with\nthe sense organ but also from the classificational power of the mind\nor self. With the perceptual awareness, \u201cThat\u2019s a\npot,\u201d for instance, the pot as an individual in connection with\na sensory faculty is responsible for the cognition of a\nproperty-bearer, for what is called the qualificandum portion of the\nperception, without admixture of memory, but the sensory connection is\nnot by itself responsible for the qualifier portion, the pothood, also\nidentified as the \u201cpredication content\u201d\n(prak\u0101ra, the verbalizable \u201cway\u201d something\nappears), the thing\u2019s classification as a pot. The\nclassificational power of the mind should not, however, be understood\nas innate so much as the product of experience over the course of a\nlifetime. Repeatable features of reality get impressed on the mind or\nself in the form of memory dispositions. That is, in perceiving\na as an F, normally an F-sa\u1e43sk\u0101ra formed\nby previous knowledge-source-produced bits of awareness of things F\nwould be a causal factor. The perception\u2019s own content includes\nthe repeatable nature of the qualifier through the operation of this\nfactor. We see the tree as a tree, and it is a tree in fact.\n4.2 Indeterminate cognition of a qualifier\n\nThe idea of indeterminate perception is a latecomer in Ny\u0101ya\ntradition. Gautama, V\u0101tsy\u0101nana, and Uddyotakara, whose\nwritings form the core of the early school, do not recognize an\nindeterminate type of perception. The tenth-century author\nV\u0101caspati introduces the notion into the system (1996: 111).\nGa\u1e45ge\u015ba is clearly aware of this history, for he opens his\ndiscussion by echoing V\u0101caspati's commentary on\nNy\u0101ya-s\u016btra 1.1.4 where, in considering the\nNy\u0101ya-s\u016btra\u2019s definition of perception,\nV\u0101caspati takes the two words\n\u2018avyapade\u015bya\u2019 (\u201cnon-verbal\u201d) and\n\u2018vyavas\u0101y\u00e2tmaka\u2019\n(\u201cdefinite\u201d) as indicating two types of perception,\nindeterminate and determinate. Udayana and Ga\u1e45ge\u015ba follow\nhim, but there seems to have been some dissension among later\nNaiy\u0101yikas (Sibajiban Bhattacharyya 1990: 172\u20136).\n\nDeterminate perception, i.e., perceptual knowledge, is concept-laden,\na cognizing of a qualificandum through a qualifier. Things\nhave multiple properties some of which normally go undetected on any\ngiven occasion of experience. One can see Devadatta without seeing his\nback. Wholes are implicit in their parts, the very notion of which\nmakes no sense cut off from that of the whole: parts are parts of a\nwhole. If the ontological layering of things having qualifiers were\nnot reflected in a causal ordering of an indeterminate perception\nfeeding, so to say, the determinate, then perception of a\nqualificandum should entail that the \u201cthick\u201d particular be\npresented, i.e., the thing with all its properties, and, as\nGa\u1e45ge\u015ba argues, a blind person in touching a yellow piece\nof cloth would know its color as yellow (2020: 359\u201360). The idea\nof indeterminate perception picking up just one or another feature of\nthings is thus tied to Ny\u0101ya realism. The idea historically,\nhowever, was taken over from Buddhists, it seems (Perrett: 2016).\n\nIn a thought experiment, Ga\u1e45ge\u015ba imagines a child\nencountering a cow for the very first time (2020: 560). He argues that\nthe child can grasp the concept of cowhood and, had she the right\nwords, could say, correctly, \u201cThat\u2019s a cow,\u201d even\nthough she has had no previous experience of cows. The cowhood\npredication content is supplied by what is called\n\u201cindeterminate\u201d cognition of the qualifier, a first stage,\nso to say, of the sensory information flow. According to\nGa\u1e45ge\u015ba, such indeterminate cognition has to be positied to\nunderstand how we have, on the whole, workable concepts of things. The\nargument is that in a typical case of a first-time perceptual\nawareness of, for instance, a cow, there is a prior stage in the\ncausal process that is an indeterminate cognition, indeterminate in\nthat cowness is cognized but not as related to the particular cow, the\nqualificandum of the ensuing determinate perception. All other cases\nof cognition of an entity as qualified have a prior cognition of the\nqualifier as a causal factor. It is thus reasonable that the case of a\nfirst-time perception does as well. But since here clearly we do not\nhave a mental disposition (sa\u1e43sk\u0101ra) at work,\nindeterminate cognition has to be posited.\n\nSomething like indeterminate perception is posited by moderate\nfoundationalists in analytic epistemology as helping to solve the\nproblem of a justification regress, it seems (Phillips 2012: 50). A\nmental state not embedding an assertion and so immune to questions\nwhether it is true or false is proposed. BonJour (2003: 20): \u201c\n\u2026 such a state is, as it were, semi-assertive or\nsemi-judgmental in character: it has a kind of content or cognitive\nsignificance, but not in a way that would raise a further issue of\njustification.\u201d Such a comparison could be misleading, however.\nPerception, according to Ga\u1e45ge\u015ba, is a doxastic justifier.\nThe foundations of our worldly beliefs are doxastic in that\ndeterminate perceptions embed propositions that say at a minimum that\nsomething is some way or another. Concept-free perception may be\nthought of as Ny\u0101ya\u2019s way of rendering our ability to form\nconcepts merely from perception\u2019s phenomenological side. It is a\ntheoretical posit made to explain how our concepts originate in\nreality\u2014a problem that is epitomized in cases of a first-time\nperception of something as an F, the concept F-hood being previously\nunavailable to the perceiver.\n4.3 Apperception\n\n\u201cApperception,\u201d anuvyavas\u0101ya, is defined as\na perception taking a preceding cognition or another psychological\nproperty as its object, typically a scoping cognition in relation to\nanother scoped (Phillips 2012: 48\u201350). Efforts and desires can\nbe similarly targeted. Through apperception, Ga\u1e45ge\u015ba\nclaims, one knows infallibly the intentionality, the\n\u201cobjecthood,\u201d vi\u1e63ayat\u0101, of the\ncognition scoped, in its qualificandum, qualifier, and relational\nportions. One knows, in other words, what the scoped purports to be\nabout, and one knows this independently of a determination of the\ntarget\u2019s being knowledge or not. Ga\u1e45ge\u015ba argues that\nsince the sensory connection in this case is not mediated by a\nmaterial organ, apperception is infallible about the contents of the\nscoped, but not of course about its truth. He devotes a long section\nof his perception chapter to defending this and other views about\napperception in the face of opponents claiming he is giving up central\nplanks of his theory.\n\nApperception makes certification possible because it sets up the item\nto be certified, showing the type of cognition the scoped is. Our\napperceptive ability to determine whether the scoped cognition is\nputatively perceptual, inferential, analogical, testimonial, or of\nanother character has epistemic relevance, since, as with all\nperception, there would be a presumption in favor of its correctness.\nThus there would also be restoration of a presumption of the truth for\na scoped cognition that had been brought into doubt were it judged to\nbe perceptual, inferential, analogical, or testimonial in character,\nalthough further examination might prove the identification wong. Note\nthat if further examination were called for, its direction would be\ndetermined by the apperception of cognitive type. For, the criteria of\ngenuine perception, inference, and the rest vary according to origin.\nThe characteristic epistemic merits and flaws (gu\u1e47a and\ndo\u1e63a) are very different for each knowledge source and\nthere are also significant differences within species of perception in\nparticular. Thus apperceptive judgment of putative type directs\ninquiry, telling us what to check.\n\nCorollary to Ga\u1e45ge\u015ba\u2019s thesis of the apperceptibility\nof cognitive types is his view that illusion can be scoped such that\nthere too we find, abstractly, a cognition of an object as qualified\nby a qualifier, for example, of a piece of tin appearing to be silver.\nHe also presents the argument that the fact that we can later see the\nsame thing as really the tin it is shows that the illusion is a single\ncognition and not, contra the Pr\u0101bh\u0101kara, two cognitions, a\nperception and a remembering along with a failure to notice their\ndifference. But scoping an illusory awareness is supposed to show\nthis, too, and in a particularly dramatic way when one knows that the\ncognition is illusory while it continues, such as apparent sight of a\ndouble moon or a person with hepatitis seeing a wall she knows is\nwhite as yellow. Although apperception is said not in itself to be\nable to determine the veridicality of an awareness, in such a case the\nsubject practically sees one thing (the wall) appearing to be\nsomething it is not (yellow), anyath\u0101-khy\u0101ti.\n5. Inference\n\nGa\u1e45ge\u015ba\u2019s contributions to understanding the\nknowledge source called \u201cinference,\u201d\nanum\u0101na, and \u201cinferential knolwedge,\u201d\nanumiti, come on top of a long history of advances both\nwithin Ny\u0101ya and outside, from Yog\u0101c\u0101ra Buddhist\nlogicians and epistemologists, in particular, but also others.\nGa\u1e45ge\u015ba was a great student of philosophy. Most of the\ntechnical system can be found in his near predecessor,\nMa\u1e47ika\u1e47\u1e6dha Mi\u015bra (1953), and discussions of\nfallacies echo the seventh-century Buddhist Dharmak\u012brti (1993)\nand others. However, his treatment of inference is, arguably, more\nelaborate than that of any predecessor, and, as is his ususal\npractice, he examines a host of similar definitions of key items, such\nas \u201cpervasion,\u201d as well as many opponent positions before\ndefending one or more of his own.\n\nConsidering the development of logic in the West, it important to keep\nin mind that inference throughout Ny\u0101ya is part of epistemology.\nSomething about the world is known by any veritable inference. An\ninference must have premises that are themselves known. Ny\u0101ya\nphilosophers do not distinguish between a formally valid deductive\nargument (which may or may not have false premises) and deductive\narguments that are \u201ccogent\u201d (with no unjustified premises\nand no errors).\n\nA set of logical terms is standard across Ny\u0101ya and most of the\nother classical schools, and Ga\u1e45ge\u015ba both uses them and\nprovides his own precise definitions:\n\n\n\npak\u1e63a\n(a) inferential subject; a mountain in a stock\nexample \n\ns\u0101dhana\n(\\(H\\)) prover (\u2018hetu\u2019 is a synonym);\nsmokiness \n\ns\u0101dhya\n (\\(S\\)) probandum, the property to be proved; fieriness\n\n\nvy\u0101pti\n \\(\\forall x (Hx \\to Sx)\\) inference-grounding pervasion;\n\n\u201cWherever smoke, there fire\u201d \n\n\n\nFor example, he characterizes an inferential subject,\npak\u1e63a (2020: 734):\n\n\nAn inferential subject (pak\u1e63a) occurs where there is no\nknowledge source that has positively established something in\nco\u00f6rdination with an absence of a desire to know. Thus, that is\nnot an inferential subject if there is a knowledge source that has\nalready positively established whatever and no desire to know\n(it by inference). \u2026 This is what it is to be an inferential\nsubject (as a factor in the generation of inferential knowledge).\nAdmittedly, this definition does not differentiate it from anything,\nsince to be an inferential subject is a property with universal scope\n(anything can be an inferential subject, qualities as well as\nsubstances, universals as well as particulars, and so on).\nNevertheless, the way the word \u201bpak\u1e63a\u2019 is\nused has been explained.\n\n\nA stock example of an inference:\n\n \\(Ha\\) (The mountain is smoky.)\n \\(\\forall x (Hx \\to Sx)\\) (Whatever is smoky is fiery.)\n \\(Sa\\) (The mountain is fiery.)\n\n\nGa\u1e45ge\u015ba devotes several long sections of the chapter to\nissues surrounding the inductive support that inferential knowledge\npresumes, a basis for the proper formation of the inference-informing\nsa\u1e43sk\u0101ra or \u201cmental disposition\u201d\nresponsible for a subject\u2019s being able to remember (in a crucial\nmental event called \u201creflection,\u201d\npar\u0101mar\u015ba) a vy\u0101pti or inclusion of\nall things \\(H\\) as also things \\(S\\). This is the\n\u201cexample.\u201d\n\n\n\nd\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e6d\u0101nta\n\\(Hb,Sb\\) & \\(\\neg Hc, \\neg Sc\\) pervasion-supportive\nexample, a location known to possess both the prover and the probandum\n(a fiery kitchen hearth); also, a known absence of the prover where\nthere is a known absence of the probandum. \n\n\n\nInference-grounding \u201cpervasions,\u201d vy\u0101pti,\nare of different sorts, but they all obtain in nature, such as that\nbetween smokiness and fieriness. Ga\u1e45ge\u015ba and all\nNaiy\u0101yikas are much occupied with pervasions, their nature and\nhow they are known.\n5.1 Natural entailment, vy\u0101pti, \u201cpervasion\u201d\n\nAfter rejecting twenty-four attempts\u2014close attempts\u2014to\ndefine the natural relation of pervasion such that the presence of a\npervaded property at a location proves that another, the pervader, is\nthere, too, Ga\u1e45ge\u015ba endorses the following characterization\n(2020: 623):\n\n\nPervasion, vy\u0101pti, is a prover \\(H\\)\u2019s having its\nlocations shared by a probandum \\(S\\) so long as \\(S\\) when specified\nas the counterpositive of an absolute absence (i.e., as \\(\\neg S\\))\nhas shared locations, shared with the absence of the prover (i.e.,\nwith \\(\\neg H\\): no \\(\\neg S\\) occurs on anything that is not also a\n\\(\\neg H\\)), and if shared with something that is the counterpositive\nof such an absence (\\(H\\)) also does not share it there (in the case\nof a non-locus-pervading property).\n\n\nAll \\(H\\) are \\(S\\) so long as there are no \\(\\neg S\\) that share a\nlocation with something that is not a \\(\\neg H\\). That is, there will\nbe pervasion given co-locatedness so long as what the \\(S\\) is,\naccording to the definition, is not something that in serving as the\ncounterpositive of an absence\u2014specifically a counterpositive\nhaving shared locations, a universal, a class character, a repeatable\nproperty and not a particular instance (firehood as opposed to, say,\nkitchen fire)\u2014does not share any location that does not also\nhouse a \\(\\neg H\\). Goekoop (1967: 111) has a nice paraphrase that\nmakes the point a little clearer: \u201cThere is a pervasion of \\(H\\)\nby \\(S\\) if and only if \\(H\\) has a common locus with \\(S\\) in such a\nway that \\(S\\) is none of the things that qua class are completely\nabsent from some locus of \\(H\\).\u201d\n\nGa\u1e45ge\u015ba\u2019s definition is supposed to solve a problem\nconcerning inferences about non-locus-pervading properties, such as a\nmonkey-conjunction in a tree, a case on which many of the rejected\ndefinitions floundered. \u201cThis tree possesses a\nmonkey-conjunction, since it is this tree (which always has\nmonkeys)\u201d is a good inference even though the tree at its roots\nhas the ruled-out sort of counterpositive according to the definition.\nInferences involving conjunctions are ruled in if the \\(S\\) is a\nproperty that while not present at \\(l\\) along with the \\(H\\) in some\nspecified portion of \\(l\\) is not so overall, that is, at or in all\nportions of \\(l\\). The location \\(l\\) would be something that is\nindeed \\(S\\) in some portion, as a tree does have a monkey in its\nbranches though not at its roots.\n5.2 How entailments are known\n\nInferences put forth for others (par\u00e2rtha) make plain\nthe conditions that work with oneself (sv\u00e2rtha)\nautomatically, and in texts of philosophy little is automatic. Thus\nbuilt into the conception of the operation of inference are the\ninductive procedures whereby a pervasion is known. Putatively similar\ninstances, sapak\u1e63a, are defined as cases known to\npossess the probandum and thus should also, at least in one (as first\ninsisted by the Buddhist Dign\u0101ga), exhibit the prover (e.g.,\n\\(Hb\\) and \\(Sb\\))\u2014while putatively dissimilar instances,\nvipak\u1e63a, are defined as cases known not to possess the\nprobandum and thus should lack the prover, too (e.g., \\(\\neg Sc\\) and\n\\(\\neg Hc\\)). The example, d\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e6d\u0101nta,\nis normally a single instance of sapak\u1e63a where the\nprover also occurs (\\(Hb\\) and \\(Sb\\)), its citing thus indicating\nthat there is inductive support. In other words, by reference to cases\nthat are sapak\u1e63a \u2014i.e., known instances of the\nprobandum\u2014where the prover is also found, positive evidence is\nmarshalled to support an inference-underpinning pervasion\n(anvaya, \u201cpositive correlation\u201d). And by\nreference to cases that are vipak\u1e63a \u2014i.e., known\ninstances of the absence of the probandum\u2014further support is\ngarnered by our not finding the prover (vyatireka,\n\u201cnegative correlation\u201d). Citing an example is shorthand to\nindicate that such a procedure supports assertion of a\nvy\u0101pti, \u201cpervasion\u201d or general rule.\nGa\u1e45ge\u015ba devotes several sections of the\nJewel\u2019s inference chapter to elucidating inferences\nbased on both sapak\u1e63a and vipak\u1e63a, as\nwell as those based exclusively on sapak\u1e63a\n(\u201cpositive-only inference\u201d) and exclusively on\nvipak\u1e63a (\u201cnegative-only inference\u201d). In\ngeneral, it is \u201cwide experience,\u201d\nbh\u016byo-dar\u015bana, that is responsible for\npervasion-knowledge. But this term, championed by Udayana, and others,\nis vague, and Ga\u1e45ge\u015ba devotes several sections to inductive\nmethod.\n\nThere is also \u201chypothetical reasoning,\u201d tarka,\nwhich, although not itself a knowledge source, is said to be able to\nshift the balance of what it is rational to accept. Its main role is\nto help people grasp pervasions, and is an important supplement to the\ninferences that are central to philosophic controversies.\nGa\u1e45ge\u015ba explains tarka as a hypothetical argument\nrevealing a fallacy or defeater with respect to a position\n\u223cp opposed to another position p that is to be\naccepted so long as p has independent evidence in its favor,\ntechnically called, pratik\u016bla-tarka. There is, however,\nalso anuk\u016bla-tarka, \u201csupportive reasoning,\u201d\nsuch as economy of conception, that is positive in character. The\ntypes of tarka that Ga\u1e45ge\u015ba recognizes are: (1)\n\u0101tm\u00e2\u015braya, \u201cself-dependence\u201d\n(begging the question), (2) anyony\u00e2\u015braya,\n\u201cmutual dependence\u201d (mutual presupposition), (3)\ncakraka, \u201ccircularity\u201d (reasoning in a circle),\n(4) anavasth\u0101 \u201cinfinite regress,\u201d (5)\nani\u1e63\u1e6da-prasa\u1e45ga, \u201cunwanted\nconsequence\u201d (contradiction), (6)\nprathama-upasthitatva, \u201cbeing presupposed by the\nother,\u201d the \u201cfirst established\u201d (a form of\nanuk\u016bla, \u201cfavorable,\u201d tarka), (7)\nutsarga, \u201chasty generalization,\u201d (8)\nvinigaman\u0101-viraha, \u201cdifferentiation\nfailure,\u201d (9) l\u0101ghava, \u201ceconomy of\nconception,\u201d \u201ctheoretic lightness\u201d (another form of\nfavorable tarka), and (10) gaurava, \u201clack of\neconomy of conception,\u201d \u201ctheoretic heaviness\u201d\n(Bagchi 1951: 151).\n\nGa\u1e45ge\u015ba devotes a section of his inference chapter to\ntarka where he shows \u201cpragmatic contradiction\u201d\nalso to be included, which was mentioned above in connection with his\nrejection of skepticism and defense of knowledge as the default for\nawareness. That passage begins (2020: 649):\n\n\nAs an example, consider the particular doubt about smoke as pervaded\nby fire. If smoke is not produced from a set of causes excluding fire,\nthen smoke, as not produced from a causal complex including fire,\nwould not be produced (a conclusion in contradiction, presumably, with\nthe doubter\u2019s belief that smoke is produced). Now doubt (against\nthis hypothetical reasoning): Could the smoke come to be from\nsomething that is not fire? Or just in some instances could it come to\nbe without fire? Or could it come to be simply by chance\n(ahetuka, \u201cwithout a cause\u201d)?\n\nWere a subject \\(M\\) who has ascertained thoroughgoing positive\ncorrelations (\\(S\\) where \\(H\\)) and negative correlations (where no\n\\(S\\), no \\(H\\)), to doubt that an effect might arise without a cause,\nthen\u2014to take up the example of smoke and fire\u2014why should\n\\(M\\), as \\(M\\) does in a rulewise manner, resort to fire for smoke,\nto food to allay hunger, and to speech to communicate to another\nperson?\n\n\nGa\u1e45ge\u015ba argues that tarka is useful for\u2014as\nwe might say these days\u2014re\u00ebstablishing a presumption of\ntruth in favor of one or another thesis brought into doubt. For\nexample, by supposing the truth of an opponent\u2019s thesis and\nshowing how it leads to unacceptable consequences, one repossesses a\npresumption of truth, provided one\u2019s own thesis is supported by\nat least the appearance of a knowledge source and, further, that it\nhas not itself been ruled out. Thus tarka comprises arguments\nthat are not in themselves knowledge-generators but capable\nnonetheless of showing what we should and should not believe. In\nparticular, reasoning can show \u201cuntoward ramifications\u201d\n(prasa\u1e45ga) of not accepting a conclusion that is\nevidenced, Ga\u1e45ge\u015ba says. Forms of tarka such as\nself-contradiction, infinite regress, and circular reasoning are\nemployed in the dialogic exchanges constructed in the Jewel\nand other works of later and indeed early Ny\u0101ya philosophy and,\nfor that matter, all the philosophic schools.\n5.3 The \u201cadditional condition,\u201d up\u0101dhi, and other fallacies\n\nInferential awareness, like the other types, is defeasible, and while\nwe have every right to accept, and act on, undefeated inferences, we\nare sometimes wrong. In particular, knowledge and justification do not\npass from premises to conclusion if we become aware of an\nup\u0101dhi, an \u201cadditional condition,\u201d which\nwould be a blocker of \u201creflection\u201d through undermining the\ngeneralization on which such reflection depends. Thus awareness of an\nup\u0101dhi is a preventer of inferential knowledge, a\n\u201cdefeater,\u201d leading to belief relinquishment by someone\nwho has hitherto not noticed the condition and who has erroneously\narrived at a conclusion on the basis of a falsely induced,\npseudo-pervasion. A rough (and non-classical) example: I know that Al\nhas a temper that will flare up in certain circumstances from having\nwitnessed many tantrums such that I expect that Al will explode by\nmaking an inference when I see that the circumstances obtain, but\nhaving overlooked that it is only with Belle that Al is so irascible\nand Belle not being present in the circumstances where I expect, by\npseudo-inference, Al\u2019s temper to flare, Belle would be the\nup\u0101dhi, the \u201cadditional condition.\u201d\nDiscussion of the concept occupies more than a tenth of\nGa\u1e45ge\u015ba\u2019s long inference chapter.\n\nThe up\u0101dhi (\\(U\\)) has a negative character, serving, at\nleast in the first place, to undermine a putative inferential\nconclusion by showing that the pervasion\u2014all \\(H\\) as \\(S\\), a\nprover (\\(H\\)) as pervaded by a probandum (\\(S\\))\u2014on which it\ndepends does not hold. But an up\u0101dhi may also serve as\npositive restorer of knowledge in that when it occurs together\nwith an original prover (\\(H\\)) that it undercuts (thus \\(H \\\n\\&\\ U\\)), the inferential conclusion is reestablished.\n\nAccording to a traditional definition which, although refined by\nGa\u1e45ge\u015ba, suits most purposes, an up\u0101dhi is a\nproperty \\(U\\) such that\n\n\\(U\\) pervades the probandum, the s\u0101dhya, \\(S\\)\n(i.e., anything that is an \\(S\\) is a \\(U\\),\ns\u0101dhya-vy\u0101paka): \\(\\forall x (Sx \\to Ux)\\)\n\\(U\\) does not pervade the prover, the s\u0101dhana or\nhetu, \\(H\\) (i.e., there is something that is an \\(H\\) but\nnot a \\(U\\), s\u0101dhana-avy\u0101paka): \\(\\exists x(Hx \\\n\\&\\ \\neg Ux)\\)\n\n\nIt follows then that there is \u201cdeviation\u201d (the prover is\nsaid to \u201cdeviate,\u201d being somewhere the probandum is not)\nand no relation of pervasion.\n\n\\(\\exists x(Hx \\ \\&\\ \\neg Sx)\\)\n\n\nThere are lots of other fallacies that Ga\u1e45ge\u015ba discusses.\nThe Ny\u0101ya-s\u016btra lists five\n\u201cpseudo-provers,\u201d hetv-\u0101bh\u0101sa, which\nGa\u1e45ge\u015ba examines at length:\n\n\u201cDeviation,\u201d in three varieties:\n\n\nthe \u201ccommon,\u201d which is knowledge of a counterexample\n(\\(Hb, \\neg Sb\\))\nthe \u201cunique,\u201d defined as a putative prover\u2019s not\nbeing known to occur in places where the probandum is known to occur\nor not to occur (for example, the \u201cprover,\u201d being-sound,\nwith respect to an inferential subject, sound, since only sound has\nthe universal being-a-sound which then cannot prove anything)\nthe \u201cinconclusive,\u201d where the property specifying the\ninferential subject is universally locatable such that there can be no\nevidence outside it (nothing is outside it) without begging the\nquestion (thus, with a few exceptions, no inference beginning\n\u201cEverything is \\(F\\) (momentary, material, etc.)\u201d\nis acceptable since nothing could count as evidence if the inferential\nsubject is everything)\n\nthe \u201ccontradictory,\u201d where \\(Ha\\) proves the absence\nof a putative probandum, i.e., \\(\\neg Sa\\)\n\u201ccounterinference,\u201d which is a putative prover that\nwould establish a conclusion \\(Sa\\) except that its evidence base\nconsisting of correlations, positive and negative, between things\n\\(H\\) and \\(S\\), is matched by an opponent's inference to \\(\\neg Sa\\)\ncomplete with correlations between a counterprover \\(J\\) and \\(\\neg\nS\\) (this fallacy reveals a social dimension to knowledge)\nthe \u201cunestablished,\u201d which Ga\u1e45ge\u015ba views as\nthree separate fallacies:\n\n\na putative prover as unestablished with respect to location or\nproperty-bearer, e.g., \\(Ha\\)?\nits being unestablished with respect to essential nature (e.g.,\n\u201cThe lake is fiery since it is smokey\u201d)\nthe unestablished by way of not being pervaded by the probandum\n(said not to be a separate fallacy but reducing to deviation, the\ncontradictory, or the defeated)\n\nthe \u201cdefeated,\u201d the \u201cdefeated in advance,\u201d\nas it were, a kind of \u201cpatent falsehood.\u201d\n\n\nThese \u201cflaws of the prover,\u201d hetu-do\u1e63a, are\nalso called \u201cconstant flaws,\u201d nitya-do\u1e63a,\nas opposed to puru\u1e63a-do\u1e63a, \u201cflaws of a\nperson,\u201d which are anitya-do\u1e63a, \u201coccasional\nflaws.\u201d Admittedly, Ga\u1e45ge\u015ba contends that sometimes\neven \u201cfailure to grasp a pervasion is (not a logical flaw but) a\nflaw belonging to a person or subject\u201d (2020: 884).\nNevertheless, the five pseudo-provers are separated out from other\ndefeaters called clinchers from the Ny\u0101ya-s\u016btra on,\nbecause they highlight logical\u2014or in the case of (3)\nepistemological\u2014rules as opposed to personal failures such as\nfailing to pay attention. The up\u0101dhi fallacy, too,\nentails a counterexample and so is a \u201cconstant flaw,\u201d\nalthough failure to notice one on occasion can be a personal\nerror.\n\nTwo further types of defeater or pseudo-defeater identified in the\nNy\u0101ya-s\u016btra are, first, j\u0101ti,\n\u201cfalse analogies,\u201d which seem dismissed by\nGa\u1e45ge\u015ba (in the voice of an opponent) saying that they are\nnot good responses in a debate or controversy (2020: 949), in contrast\nwith, second, \u201cclinchers,\u201d nigraha-sth\u0101na,\nwhose importance in debate is acknowledged but not in any detail taken\nup (perhaps Ga\u1e45ge\u015ba sees the\nNy\u0101ya-s\u016btra\u2019s list, as explained by\nV\u0101tsy\u0101yana, as satisfactory). But j\u0101ti are\ndismissed because, it seems, however they may have been conceived in\nearly years (Prets 2001), long before Ga\u1e45ge\u015ba they come to\nbe understood as misleading analogies and classified as\ntricks of debate or philosophic conundra, not really worthy\nof inquiry. A j\u0101ti is a pseudo-defeater in the broad\nsense of a misleading analogy, and there is less agreement about them\nacross school than about pseudo-provers, clinchers, and, we must add,\ntypes of tarka, \u201chypothetical reasoning,\u201d which\nwere reviewed above.\n5.4 Three philosophic inferences\n\nGa\u0144ge\u015ba advances three contentious inferences in his\ninference chapter, two of them\u2014a theistic inference and one\nabout the possibility of \u201cliberation,\u201d\nmukti\u2014defended at considerable length (all three are\nreconstructed and examined in Phillips 2012: 65\u201371). As much as\nsupporting longstanding positions of Ny\u0101ya on (a)\n\u201cself,\u201d \u0101tman, (b) \u201cLord,\u201d\n\u012b\u015bvara, and (c) mukti, his treatments\nillustrate his inferential system including defeating and hypothetical\nreasoning. Indeed, illustration of the system sometimes seems to be\nthe main goal.\n\nAlthough Ga\u1e45ge\u015ba accepts the position of early\nNaiy\u0101yika Uddyotakara (c. 600) that one knows oneself\nperceptually as expressed by the word \u2018I\u2019 in perceptual\njudgments such as \u201cI am seeing a pot\u201d (Taber 2012),\npresumably he sees proving a self by inference as useful because\nBuddhists, for one, deny it (famously). And at least in\nYog\u0101c\u0101ra Buddhism perception is accepted as a knowledge\nsource, with the insistence that no self is known by it or indeed by\nany other means.\n\nThe Ny\u0101ya-s\u016btra has two arguments: diachronic\nsynthesis and synchronic. The former is illustrated by the\nrecognition, \u201cThis is that Devadatta I saw yesterday,\u201d\nwhich could not be an expression of knowledge (and of course it is) if\nthe self of the recognizer had not endured (the recognition is fed by\na memory of Devadata as seen the day before, and one person does not\nhave another\u2019s memories). The latter is illustrated by, \u201cI\nam touching what I see\u201d (a self is needed to bring together the\ninformation across sensory modality). In the Jewel\u2019s\nperception chapter, Ga\u1e45ge\u015ba at times refers to or echoes\nthese arguments, but the argument for a self in the inference chapter\nis different.\n\nGa\u1e45ge\u015ba follows V\u0101tsy\u0101yana under\nNy\u0101ya-s\u016btra 1.1.5 (the \u201cinference\ns\u016btra\u201d): \u201cEvery living body (the inferential subject)\nhas a self (the probandum), since every living body has\nbreath (the prover), unlike a pot (the example, a pot being\nqualified by both absence-of-self and absence-of-breath).\u201d My\nsense is that here the main point is as much to illustrate\n\u201cnegative-only\u201d inference as to endorse\nV\u0101tsy\u0101yana\u2019s reasoning, but it is endorsed. The\ninferential subject includes all living bodies, and so there is no\nsapak\u1e63a, no examples of the probandum known outside the\nset of things that are living bodies. Thus the inference has to be\nnegative-only, based solely on correlations of absences,\n\u201cunlike a pot,\u201d a pot having neither breath nor self.\nFundamental truths of things (tattva), which are captured by\nphilosophical definitions, seem accessible only through fundamental\ndistinctions being known through negative-only inferences, for\nexample, this inference to self (\u0101tman) as a fundamental\ncategory of substance.\n\nIn a slightly more more elaborate version, Ga\u1e45ge\u015ba puts\nforth two steps. First, desires and the like are proved to have a\nlocus, like all qualities. In step two, self is proved to be that\nlocus, a distinct substance, different from earth, water,\ntejas, and so on down the traditional list, by eliminative\nargument. Defeaters for the proposition that desire and the like\nbelong to earth or any of the rest of the items on the ontological\nlist consists of hypothetical reasoning such as the following. If\ndesire were a property of earth (or water and so on), then like the\ncolor that exists in earthen things, it, too, would be perceived.\nSurveying pots and the like, we find that nothing material has desire,\ncognition, etc., outside of living bodies. He writes (2020: 803):\n\n\nGiven that desire has been proved to have an inherent cause (by the\ninference previously stated, \u201cDesire has origins in an inherent\ncause, since it is an effect,\u201d we formulate a second\ninference), being-a-desire occurs in that (namely, desire) which has\nas emergent cause a connection, since being-a-desire is a\nuniversal directly pervaded by the\nqualityhood-that-occurs-in-specific-qualities-grasped-by-an-eternal-organ\n(i.e., manas or the organ of hearing), like\nbeing-a-sound (soundhood, the universal of sound). And this emergent\ncause, which is a connection, is specified by something, since it is a\nconnection. (That \u201csomething\u201d is the living body.) If\nmerely connection with a self were the origins of desire (without\nrequiring something else delimiting it), then ramifications would\noverextend. Therefore, having-a-self, which is the specifier of the\nconnection that gives rise to desire, is proved with respect to the\nliving body. (That is, every living body is\n\u201censelved.\u201d)\n\n\nThe inference for positing an \u012b\u015bvara, the\n\u201cLord,\u201d is a little less system-bound than this one for an\n\u0101tman, but its history stretches through several earlier\nNy\u0101ya efforts, in particular by V\u0101caspati (c. 950). It is an\ninference to a creator based on both positive and negative\ncorrelations: \u201cEarth and the like have a conscious agent as an\ninstrumental cause, since they are effects, like a pot and\nunlike an atom (whatever is an effect has a conscious agent as an\ninstrumental cause).\u201d Buddhists point to counterexamples, such\nas growing grass. Growing grass has the prover property,\nbeing-an-effect, but not the probandum,\nhaving-an-agent-as-an-instrumental cause. The Ny\u0101ya reply is to\npoint out that growing grass and all such examples are in dispute,\nthat is to say, fall within the domain of the inferential subject\n(pak\u1e63a), here \u201cearth and the like,\u201d to wit,\nanything that is an effect but whose agential cause is not apparent,\nunlike the comparison class, a pot, for instance, which is clearly\nboth an effect and has an agent as an instrumental cause. Nothing that\nfalls within the domain of the subject can be used either as an\nexample supporting the rule of vy\u0101pti inclusion or as a\ncounterexample, since that would beg the question. The whole point of\ninference is to make something known that was not known previously,\nand here, as with the existence of atoms, the conclusion could not be\nknown perceptually. The theological inference has the purpose of\nshowing that things like the earth and growing grass have an\nagent within the causal complex that brings them about. This is not\nsomething that we know without making the inference.\n\nSo, by the rules governing proper inference, the putative\ncounterexample is rejected, and the proof looks pretty good. For,\ncleverly it divides all things into three categories, as\nV\u0101caspati remarks (1996: 563). There are uncreated things, atoms,\nfor instance, created things that clearly have an agential cause, such\nas pots, and things such as the earth and growing grass that do not\nclearly have an agential cause. This last set becoming the inferential\nsubject is bracketed such that no examples can be pulled from it.\n\nHowever, another refutation refined by Buddhist philosophers over the\ncenturies is not dismissed so easily (Mok\u1e63\u0101k\u0101ragupta\n1998: 98; Patil 2009). The Ny\u0101ya argument falls to an\nup\u0101dhi, in this case the property,\nhaving-a-perceptible-body. As we have seen, an up\u0101dhi is\ndefined as a property that pervades the probandum while failing to\npervade the prover, that is to say, that is entailed by the presence\nof the probandum while not being instanced in at least one case of the\nprover. Having-an-agent-as-an-instrumental-cause, which is the \\(S\\)\nor probandum property of the target inference, is pervaded by the\nagent\u2019s-having-a-perceptible-body, which is the \\(U\\) or\nup\u0101dhi property: all agents have bodies. But there is\nsomething that is an \\(H\\) but not a \\(U\\); something that is an\neffect but does not have within its causal complex an agent with a\nperceptible body, e.g., growing grass. The two conditions being met,\nit would follow that there is something that is an \\(H\\) but not an\n\\(S\\), something that is an effect but does not have an agent as an\ninstrumental cause. Thus the up\u0101dhi defeats the apparent\ninference by showing that the required pervasion and entailment do not\nhold.\n\nGa\u1e45ge\u015ba\u2019s response is to deny that the putative\nup\u0101dhi, an-agent\u2019s-having-a-perceptible-body,\npervades the probandum of the target inference,\nhaving-an-agent-as-an-instrumental-cause, and several rounds of\nobjection and response centering on Ny\u0101ya\u2019s conception of\nthe Lord as an agent without a body are aired. The Lord\u2019s\ncreative activity requires, like that of any agent, familiarity with\nthe material to be shaped, like the potter\u2019s knowledge of clay\nand of what to do to make a pot. The Lord\u2019s knowledge is to be\nconceived as appropriate to the tasks to be undertaken, such as\noriginally combining atoms, and if the Lord, like us, had to have a\nbody to have knowledge, including the knowledge required to combine\natoms, then, since bodies are combinations of atoms, there would have\nto be some earlier Creator to make the necessary\ncombinations\u2014ad infinitum. Simpler than this conception\nis that of a bodiless Creator whose knowledge is appropriate to the\nmaterial forming earth and the like but, unlike our knowledge, is not\ngenerated. This seems to be the core of Ga\u1e45ge\u015ba\u2019s\nreasoning, which is complex tarka targeting simplicity and\nfollowing V\u0101caspati in particular.\n\nAn inference to the possibility of \u201cliberation,\u201d\nmukti, brings the Jewel\u2019s inference chapter to\na close. It is particularly dense (2020: 1142) and cannot be unpacked\nin a short space, but its central analogy is noteworthy.\n\n\nThen the justification (the inference to the conclusion that suffering\ncan come to an end for an individual), well, it is that suffering in\ngeneral, or the suffering in general of Devadatta (i.e., of any\nindividual), is the counterpositive of a non-simultaneous destruction\nexisting in the same locus, since it is a property that\noccurs only as an effect, or since it is continuous until its\nend, like the light of a lamp. This continuity is its being a\nproperty that occurs only as an effect at distinct times. And in this\nway the probandum, the property to be proved (viz., being the\ncounterpositive of a non-simultaneous destruction existing in the same\nlocus), is also applicable to pleasure in general and the like:\nliberation is the breaking up of the causal chain along with its\nsource.\n\n\nTranslator\u2019s comments (2020: 1142) bring out that the crucial\npoint seems to be that something destroyed has no causal power,\nexisting only as an effect, in connection with the destruction for\nwhich it is the counterpositive. The destruction that is\nmukti is not of current but of future suffering, thus a\n\u201cnon-simultaneous\u201d destruction. The destruction exists in\nthe same locus as the suffering that would occur were it not blocked.\nThe suffering does not really occur\u2014it never comes\nabout\u2014and so its ontological status is problematic. Clearly, it\ndoes not cause anything. It comes about only as an effect in\nconnection with the bringing about of the destruction in relation to\nwhich it is the counterpositive. And any destruction is of something\n(the counterpositive) at a place or locus: \\(cDl\\). Note that the\nexample appears to work only with the second of the two provers\nmentioned: like a lamp\u2019s stream of light that can cease\nabsolutely, the suffering of an individual goes on continuously\n(through life, death, and rebirth)\u2014in the sense of regularly if\nnot without occasional spells of pleasure\u2014until its absolute\nend. Pleasure is similar.\n6. Analogy\n\nDifferent schools of classical philosophy have very different\nunderstandings of \u201canalogy,\u201d upam\u0101na, and,\nunlike with perception, inference, and testimony, cross-school\ncontroversies seem often at cross-purposes. For example,\nM\u012bm\u0101\u1e43sakas, worried about the criteria for substitutes\nfor materials enjoined to carry out rituals, talk about similarities\nas objective, whereas Naiy\u0101yikas are concerned principally with\nword meanings, although V\u0101tsy\u0101yana (1997: 170\u20131) does\nshow the usefulness of analogy to indicate something new, a medicinal\nplant, for instance, similar to one with which an interlocutor is\nfamiliar. Ga\u1e45ge\u015ba sees the working of analogy to result\nsolely in learning the meaning of words. Nevertheless, appreciation of\nsimilarity, which he sees as a supervenient property, is, he says,\ncrucial in the operation of the knowledge source. The\nJewel\u2019s chapter on analogy is quite short and lacks\nsubsections, hardly a \u201cchapter\u201d in comparison with the\nother three.\n\nWhat comes to be a stock example of analogical knowledge according to\nNy\u0101ya is elaborated in Ny\u0101ya-s\u016btra\ncommentaries and textbooks preceding Ga\u1e45ge\u015ba, who fills in\ndetails. A subject \\(S\\) inquires of a forester about a\ngavaya, which is a kind of buffalo, having heard the word\n\u2018gavaya\u2019 used among her schoolmates but not\nknowing what it means, i.e., not knowing to what\n\u2018gavaya\u2019 refers. Questioned by \\(S\\), the\nforester replies that a gavaya is like a cow, mentioning\ncertain specifics as also some dissimilarities. To simplify,\nNy\u0101ya philosophers say that the forester makes an analogical\nstatement (\u201cA gavaya is like a cow\u201d), whereby,\naccording to Ga\u1e45ge\u015ba, our subject \\(S\\) now knows in\ngeneral what the word means. But \\(S\\) does not yet know its\nreference, which he deems its principal meaning. Later encountering a\ngavaya buffalo, \\(S\\) says, \u201cThis, which is similar to\na cow, is the meaning of the word\n\u2018gavaya\u2019,\u201d a statement which expresses\n\\(S\\)\u2019s new knowledge. Every instance of knowledge has a source,\nand this one has been generated by upam\u0101na,\n\u201canalogy.\u201d Ga\u1e45ge\u015ba writes (2020: 1207):\n\n\nObjection:\n\nThe question [of the subject to the forester] concerns only the cause\nof her (eventual) knowledge (qua qualificandum). The answer gives its\nqualifiers.\n\nGa\u1e45ge\u015ba: No. Since she does not know the particulars\n(that would ground use of the word), she would be answered by the\nforester also with reference to a need for a sensory\nencounter: \u201cIf you go into the forest, you will see.\u201d\n\nTherefore, \\(S\\)\u2019s questions would concern only the distinct\ngrounds of employment: \u201cWhat is a gavaya like? On what\ngrounds does one employ the word \u2018gavaya\u2019?\u201d\nSince the one asked (viz., the forester) would not be able to show\nimmediately, directly (s\u0101k\u1e63\u0101t), what it is to\nbe a gavaya buffalo, he would talk about similarity,\nindirectly indicating it (i.e., indicating what it is to be a\ngavaya buffalo). And then later, when an individual has been\nseen by \\(S\\) who remembers the meaning of the analogical statement,\nshe acquires the knowledge: \u201cThis thing qualified by what it is\nto be a gavaya is the referent of the word\n\u2018gavaya\u2019.\u201d \\(S\\)\u2019s knowledge is of a\nparticular that is the grounds for the employment of the word. It is\nthe result of analogy (as a knowledge source).\n\n7. Testimony\n\nGa\u1e45ge\u015ba begins his final chapter of the Jewel with\na defense of the integrity of testimony as a knowledge source,\nfollowing a long tradition beginning with an extended\nNy\u0101ya-s\u016btra passage (2.1.49\u201356) that elicited\nmuch commentary. Like his predecessors, he resists an opponent\u2019s\ncontention that \u201ctestimonial\u201d knowledge results from\ninference of a certain sort such that supposing an additional\nknowledge source is unnecessary. Ga\u1e45ge\u015ba\u2019s response\nis to argue that testimony works uniquely through language, that\nwithout testimony the inferentialist\u2019s premises in the\nsubstitute inference could not be understood. Furthermore, the\ncertification conditions for testimony are different. The chapter\nincludes much reflection on linguistic meaning, including sections on\ngrammar near the end. How to understand reference is a chief concern,\nreference being viewed as the primary mode of meaning. But there is\nalso \u201cindirect indication,\u201d\nlak\u1e63a\u1e47\u0101, which works by way of a referent\nindicating something else, as when a poet says, \u201cThe\nmoon,\u201d meaning the face of the beloved. All these are standard\ntopics in Ny\u0101ya literature. Injunctions, which are also talked\nabout from the earliest by Naiy\u0101yikas as well as their\nM\u012bm\u0101\u1e43saka champions (the Veda is injunctive in\ncharacter), command a lot of attention. Their supposed ethical force\nis wrestled with, as Ga\u1e45ge\u015ba shows his mastery of\nM\u012bm\u0101\u1e43s\u0101 and resists its view of a moral\nuniverse.\n\nNy\u0101ya and M\u012bm\u0101\u1e43s\u0101 are referentialist allies\nwith similar agendas when it comes to knowledge from testimony, both\nopposed to a Yog\u0101c\u0101ra pragmatic theory of meaning. Although\nconcerned mainly with Vedic hermeneutics, M\u012bm\u0101\u1e43saka\nphilosophers pioneer many of the best arguments and counterarguments\nagainst Buddhists and others who attack Vedic authority. But\nGa\u1e45ge\u015ba does not accept the M\u012bm\u0101\u1e43saka\ncontention that the overall purport of a statement or sentence can in\ngeneral, even in cases of secondary meaning,\nlak\u1e63a\u1e47\u0101, be understood without an idea of\nthe speaker\u2019s intention. We do not have to understand the\nspeaker\u2019s intention to grasp a statement in all cases, although\nsometimes we do, for example, when multiple meanings are possible and\nwith some statements employing lak\u1e63a\u1e47\u0101. But\nthe M\u012bm\u0101\u1e43saka view that Vedic sentences have no author\nis false.\n\nGa\u1e45ge\u015ba apparently accepts the\nNy\u0101ya-s\u016btra\u2019s definition, 1.1.7:\n\u201cTestimony is the (true) statement of an trustworthy\nexpert\u201d (V\u0101tsy\u0101yana 1997: 14), which indicates\ncertification conditions centering on the speaker. He focuses,\nhowever, on the conditions wrapped up in what it is to be a (true)\nstatement from the hearer\u2019s point of view. The condition known\nas yogyat\u0101, usually rendered \u201csemantic fit,\u201d\nis given by him a broad interpretation, where not only infelicitous\nstatements such as \u201cThe gardener is watering the plants with\nfire,\u201d are violations, as is commonly pointed out, but also the\nhearer\u2019s knowing that the speaker is not an \u0101pta,\nthat the sounds are, for example, from a parrot.\n7.1 An irreducible knowledge source\n\nYog\u0101c\u0101ra Buddhists have a pragmatic theory of\nconcept-formation and view language as at best helping us get what we\nwant and avoid what we want to avoid. The Buddha\u2019s words are to\nbe trusted because of his special experience and superior capacity as\na reasoner as well as his compassion motivating his most excellent\nadvice. Ga\u1e45ge\u015ba imagines an attack on testimonial knowledge\nfrom Buddhist skeptical quarters such that, in fact, there is no\nknowledge but only helpful or unhelpful advice because there is no\ntruth, no veridicality. Statements do not correspond to facts.\nGa\u1e45ge\u015ba\u2019s rebuttal centers on knowledge production\nthrough words. Any instance of knowledge has a mode of production\ndistinct from one that fails so to produce. The argument that\nerroneous utterances fail to generate knowledge cuts no ice, since\nerroneous utterances are not veritable testimony as we Naiy\u0101yikas\nunderstand it, he says (2020: 1215). We are able to distinguish\nerroneous and true utterances by the processes that produce them, and\nthus meet the skeptical challenge.\n\nA different line of rejection of testimony is attributed to the\nVai\u015be\u1e63ika school, which is said to admit testimonial\nknowledge but to see its generation as coming from inference of a\ncertain sort. A hearer reasons: (1) Speaker \\(S\\) states p,\n(2) \\(S\\) is a \u201ctrustworthy authority,\u201d\n\u0101pta, (3) what such authorities state is true, and so,\ntherefore, (4) \\(p\\) is true. And if challenged, S could say that she\nknows \\(p\\) because of the inference. Ga\u1e45ge\u015ba\u2019s\nrebuttal centers on how premise (1) could be known. Testimony has to\nbe admitted as a separate knowledge source to understand how the\nreductionist\u2019s inference could get started. Just what is the\nknowledge source for (1)?\n7.2 The meaning of a statement\n\nIn the long chapter on testimony, one would expect speaker\ncertification conditions to be taken up, but they are not. Perhaps\nGa\u1e45ge\u015ba sees them as satisfactorily elucidated by\nV\u0101tsy\u0101yana on Ny\u0101ya-s\u016btra 1.1.7 along\nwith the later commentaries. In any case, the Jewel\u2019s\nfocus is on sentential conditions such as grammaticality and semantic\nfitness as remarked. Three conditions prominent in the grammatical\nliterature are addressed, \u201cexpectation,\u201d\n\u0101k\u0101\u1e45k\u1e63\u0101, \u201csemantic\nfit,\u201d yogyat\u0101, and \u201ccontiguity,\u201d\n\u0101satti. Ga\u1e45ge\u015ba also takes up\nt\u0101tparya, \u201c(speaker\u2019s) intention,\u201d\ndisputing the views of M\u012bm\u0101\u1e43sakas and championing\ncommon sense. Throughout the chapter, two views of sentence meaning\nare in view, (a) a \u201cBh\u0101\u1e6d\u1e6da\u201d radically\nreferentialist theory (due to Kum\u0101rila) that a word refers\nindependently of sentential context, and (b) a\n\u201cPr\u0101bh\u0101kara\u201d holistic view that has the sentence\nas a whole as informational, not words independently of sentential\ncontext. Although Ga\u1e45ge\u015ba endorses the\nBh\u0101\u1e6d\u1e6da view that a factual relation, not directly\nexpressed, accounts for sentential unity, often he frames a point\nusing the Pr\u0101bh\u0101kara theory.\n\nV\u0101tsy\u0101yana and company discuss word meaning in terms of\npossible referents (Ny\u0101ya-s\u016btra 2.2.59\u201369),\n(i) the individual, for example, \u2018cow\u2019 used for a\nparticular cow, (ii) the universal, cowhood, what all cows have in\ncommon, and (iii) \u201cshape,\u201d \u0101k\u1e5bti, as\nwith a cow-shaped pastry. The settled view is that all three are\ngenerally meant in a single usage, with predominance varying with\ncontext. Against this background, V\u0101caspati (1979) explores five\nviews of sentential meaning including both (a) the \u201ctheory of\nthe connection of the referents,\u201d the radically, incrementally\nreferentialist view espoused by Bh\u0101\u1e6d\u1e6das and\nNaiy\u0101yikas, abhihit\u00e2nvaya-v\u0101da, and (b) the\n\u201ctheory of reference of the connected,\u201d \u201cholistic\nreference,\u201d the Pr\u0101bh\u0101kara view of reference as\noccurring at the level of the sentence,\nanv\u012bt\u00e2bhidh\u0101na-v\u0101da. In his\nNy\u0101ya-s\u016btra work (1996), V\u0101caspati imports the\nBh\u0101\u1e6d\u1e6da view, according to which sentence meaning is\nderivative from the reference of individual words and other semantic\nelements taken together, with the overall connection, anvaya,\nprovided by the fact (if the statement is true) of the words\u2019\nreferents being in relation, the \u201ctruth-maker.\u201d Later\nNaiy\u0101yikas such as Ga\u1e45ge\u015ba follow him, although, to\nrepeat, Ga\u1e45ge\u015ba often talks about sentential unity\npresupposing the Pr\u0101bh\u0101kara view that the component words do\nnot individually have referential power but only as connected\ngrammatically, with a complex object or fact as that which is referred\nto by the unifying sentence.\n\n\u201cExpectation,\u201d\n\u0101k\u0101\u1e45k\u1e63\u0101, \u201c(verbal)\nexpectation,\u201d is the first of three sentential conditions taken\nup. After rejecting four attempts to define the phenomenon in its\nrelevance for the epistemology of testimony, Ga\u1e45ge\u015ba\nendorses the following (2020: 1259):\n\n\nExpectation amounts to incompleteness of reference, specifically, an\nincompleteness of \\(Y\\) with respect to \\(X\\); that is to say, without\n\\(Y\\) there would be, with respect to \\(X\\), no generation of\nawareness of an overall connection among the meanings of words and\nother factors taken in their native senses. Words (and other semantic\nunits) used as nouns, case endings, verbal roots, verbal endings,\nfinite verbs, and words in declension are such that, in a particular\ninstance, without the one or the other, there would not be awareness\ngenerated of an overall connection among all the referents mutually,\ntaking everything in its native sense.\n\n\nLists of words do not fulfill the \u201cexpectation\u201d condition,\nfor example, \u201cCow, being-the-object-of-an-action (as designated\nby a word in the accusative case), bringing.\u201d Ga\u1e45ge\u015ba\nadmits that it \u201ccould be an instance of knowledge of verbal\nmeaning, but it would not produce knowledge of an overall\nconnection\u201d (2020: 1547). Nevertheless, with him the expectation\nis also something felt by a hearer, whose grasping the\nreference of one word with its case ending (which also refers,\naccording to him) leads to expectation not just of another word but of\nits referent. Thus expectation is a psychological property mediated by\nwords in reference to a fact. It is embedded in a subject\u2019s\nunderstanding of words as united by their references comprising the\nfact that is captured by a statement. Sometimes\nGa\u1e45ge\u015ba\u2019s dialectic, particularly in several sections\non verbal compounds and the like at the end of the chapter, trades on\nthe difficulty of finding a factual item to which a word would\ncorrespond in its real-world relationality as implicated in the\nincorporation of the word grammatically into a declarative sentence.\nThus while the \u201cexpectation\u201d seems to work as a matter of\ngrammar, the \u201cgrammar\u201d is thought to reflect a fact that\nthe words pick out.\n\nGa\u1e45ge\u015ba often refers to the problem of the word list that\nis not unified, several times appearing to reinstate a grammatical\nunderstanding of \u201cexpectation\u201d as opposed to how\nobjects\u2014referents\u2014are related in fact. And once (2020:\n1547) this comes right at the heart of his endorsement of\n\u201cincremental referentialism\u201d as opposed to the\nconnectivist, \u201cholistic\u201d variety of the\nPr\u0101bh\u0101kara. He says, \u201c \u2026 a word endowed with\nexpectation and meeting the other requirements is what brings about a\nparticular presentation of an overall connection.\u201d This seems to\nbe the answer to the problem of the list whose items do not show\ngrammatical connections although they are just what the things\nthemselves demand to constitute a fact, a truth-maker: \u201cPot,\nbeing-the-object-of-an-action (as designated by the accusative case),\nbringing, action.\u201d The endings on the words in the list do not\nrefer to relations that connect up the other things properly. This is\nthe difference. Each item listed appears incomplete because, for\nexample, reference to bringing demands not only the meaning of a word\nas something that could be brought but a word in the accusative case\nwith the case ending indicating that it is in the right kind of\nrelation objectively. Every base word is by itself\n\u201cunsaturated,\u201d to use the Fregean term, referring to\nsomething in the world that has to hook up with something else\nreferred to, if there is to be a sentence and statement,\nabhihit\u00e2nvaya.\n\nIn addition to a section devoted to a second sentential condition,\n\u201csemantic fit,\u201d yogyat\u0101, Ga\u1e45ge\u015ba\nprovides a brief definition in other places in part because its\nviolation is commonly taken to be the trigger to take a word in a\nsecondary way, not directing us to a \u201cnative\u201d referent (he\nalso advances a slightly different view of the trigger which\nwe\u2019ll review later). For example (2020: 1228):\n\n\nSemantic fit (yogyat\u0101) amounts to there being no\nlegitimate block to understanding a statement.\n\n\nIncluded in this is the \u201cGettier case\u201d of a parrot\u2019s\nsaying something that a hearer \\(H\\) would take as true if \\(H\\) did\nnot know the sounds were from a parrot. In the scenario, \\(H\\) fails\nto put together the sounds as words and as a sentence and does not\nacquire testimonial knowledge. Knowing that the sounds are from a\nparrot is a block. The yogyat\u0101 condition is defined\nnegatively and is commonly invoked as a kind a coherence check. And\nhere Ga\u1e45ge\u015ba concurs.\n\nHe resists, however, the application of the principle to a Vedic\ninjunction to perform a sacrifice whose result is supposed to be in\nthe distant future, going to heaven, say, which wouldn\u2019t make\nsense, the ritualists reason, without elliptical reference to\nap\u016brva, a magical \u201cUnseen Force,\u201d\nad\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e6da, that connects the completion of the\nsacrifice with its goal. According to Ga\u1e45ge\u015ba, no\nap\u016brva is thereby referenced (etymologically that which\nis \u201cnot understood before\u201d comprehension of an injunction\nas applying to oneself, say M\u012bm\u0101\u1e43sakas) and if there\nis \u201cUnseen Force\u201d created by a sacrifice or another good\nwork it, like all karma, inheres in the self of the performer,\naffecting, in particular, his or her next incarnation. Thus again he\nendorses a doctrine of the Ny\u0101ya-s\u016btra, which also\nrejects ap\u016brva but accepts karma as popularly\nunderstood.\n\nThe Jewel\u2019s section on \u201ccontiguity\u201d is\nshort, and special topics such as ellipsis, etymology versus\nreconventionalization (only lotuses are referred to in Sanskrit by the\ncompound \u2018pa\u1e45ka-ja\u2019,\n\u201cmud-born,\u201d although plants like the water-lily are also\nborn in mud), homonymy, and others are treated more or less briefly.\nBut the topic of injuction looms large in the chapter overall along\nwith a concern with M\u012bm\u0101\u1e43saka views of moral authority\nas fundamenally a matter of Vedic injunction.\n\nInjunctions are commonly formed in Sanskrit through use of the\noptative verbal form, and a central question is just what does the\noptative affix mean. That one should do such and such seems to be the\ncore meaning about which everyone agrees, but different analyses are\ngiven of the idea that one should do such and such. A central thesis\nis that a certain kind of knowledge both prompts and guides any action\nthat is voluntary, prav\u1e5btti, whether in everyday life\nor with a ritual. So now since rituals are actions, some of these\naction-prompting thoughts are prompted by comprehending Vedic\nsentences. Ga\u1e45ge\u015ba\u2019s effort is often directed to\nintegrating our understanding of Vedic and everyday language, and he\nuses his criticisms of M\u012bm\u0101\u1e43s\u0101 analyses of ritual\nactions to illumine the voluntary in general along with \u201cdesire\nto do,\u201d effort, and the knowledge that directs action,\nincluding, especially, knowledge of a \u201cmeans to what\u2019s\nwanted,\u201d i\u1e63\u1e6da-s\u0101dhanat\u0101, an idea\nhotly debated by all factions of M\u012bm\u0101\u1e43s\u0101. A basic\ndivision in the school occurs on the issue whether means of\naccomplishing what is enjoined, or contemplated because desired,\ni\u1e63\u1e6da-s\u0101dhanat\u0101, is part of the content\nof an injunction (as itself implicated in any \u201cdesire to\ndo\u201d as the desire\u2019s cognitive content).\nBh\u0101\u1e6d\u1e6das insist that it is, but Pr\u0101bh\u0101karas\ndemur, claiming that such is known by a separate intellectual act of\n\u201cpresumption,\u201d arth\u00e2patti. For\nPr\u0101bh\u0101karas, it is simply that something \u201cought to be\ndone,\u201d its k\u0101ryat\u0101, that is the meaning of an\ninjunction, with the means to what\u2019s wanted known by\npresumption. Ga\u1e45ge\u015ba rehearses extensive arguments on both\nsides, and seems generally to favor the positions of the\nPr\u0101bh\u0101karas.\n\nIn the end, Ga\u1e45ge\u015ba champions an understanding of the\ninjunction as expressing a certain kind of knowledge-prompting action,\nespecially \u201cwhat one ought to do,\u201d\nk\u0101ryat\u0101, which he sees, agreeing with the\nPr\u0101bh\u0101kara, as the meaning of an injunction. That is to say,\nfor him, \u201cwhat one ought to do\u201d is the meaning in part.\nBut he also agrees with the Bh\u0101\u1e6d\u1e6da that a means has\nto be known or made known, and he adds another factor, effort, and the\nrequirement that the action be known as accomplishable by one\u2019s\nown effort.\n\nAn ethical view centered on Vedic injunctions is embedded in\nM\u012bm\u0101\u1e43saka attitudes, and Ga\u1e45ge\u015ba shows\nsympathy for the life regulated by ritual, in particular daily rituals\nthat require no special qualifications. But his own ethical outlook is\nnowhere explicitly stated. At places he shows affinity for a\nsoteriological ethics implicit in a mystical way of knowing the\n\u201ctruth\u201d concerning the \u201cself,\u201d\n\u0101tman, a self as experienced in a special kind of yogic\nmeditation. At several places, he quotes the Bhagavad\nG\u012bt\u0101, apparently endorsing its karma-yoga teaching of\nbenevolent action. Despite sympathy for M\u012bm\u0101\u1e43saka\npositions, when it comes to the striking and longlasting conflicts,\nethical and otherwise, between ritualists and mystics/yogins in the\nsubcontinent, Ga\u1e45ge\u015ba seems to line up with the\nyogins\u2014like, it should be noted, Gautama, the author of the\nNy\u0101ya-s\u016btra and his commentators. Indeed, although\nairing M\u012bm\u0101\u1e43s\u0101 opinion apparently with much\nsympathy, Ga\u1e45ge\u015ba sees injunctions to perform rituals as\ntrumped by yogic teachings of the way to self-discovery. But also like\nmany Naiy\u0101yikas before him, Ga\u1e45ge\u015ba appears to try to\nfind middle ground in ethics as in other areas of theory. Surely, he\nis not a radical critic of the ritualists\u2019 moral codes, more\nlikely one of their number trying to nudge colleagues into broader\npoints of view.\n7.3 \u201cIndirect indication,\u201d lak\u1e63a\u1e47\u0101\n\nThe longest section in the testimony chapter and indeed in the\nentirety of the Jewel is devoted to\nlak\u1e63a\u1e47\u0101, which is a second mode of meaning\ndependent on the first or primary called \u201cdenotation,\u201d\nabhidh\u0101na, i.e. reference. Ny\u0101ya-sutra\n2.2.62 gives about a dozen examples of semantic transference, for\nexample, \u201cThe stands are shouting,\u201d where it is not the\nstands but the people in them who are shouting. And with \u201cUsher\nin the sticks,\u201d it is ascetics who carry walking sticks who are\nto be ushered in. In this example, the primary, denotative meaning is\nnot entirely transferred since the ascetics would carry their sticks\nin with them into the dining room, it is presumed. The most common\nexample in the Jewel is \u201cThe village is\nin-the-Ga\u1e45g\u0101,\u201d where we understand the village to be\non the river\u2019s bank (the indicated) because we know\nthat no village is actually built in the Ga\u1e45g\u0101,\nwhich is very deep.\n\nThe inherited view is that a violation of yogyat\u0101,\n\u201csemantic fit,\u201d triggers a hearer to understand a\nsecondary sense. But one of the first comments Ga\u1e45ge\u015ba\nmakes about lak\u1e63a\u1e47\u0101 rejects this view,\nbringing up the phenomenon\u2019s relevance to the debate about\nsentential unity, anvaya. He writes (2020: 1250):\n\n\n\u2026 [lak\u1e63a\u1e47\u0101] is not triggered by a\nviolation of semantic fit (as is commonly held) but rather by a\nviolation of anvaya itself, of the overall connection of\nwords, the overall construction. For example, by force of context we\nunderstand from a violation of anvaya with the word\n\u2018stick\u2019 in connection with \u2018usher in\u2019\n(\u201cUsher in the sticks\u201d) that the speaker\u2019s purpose\nis to feed certain ascetics (who typically carry walking sticks) who\nwould be ushered in along with their sticks.\n\nIn a case where a secondary usage does not involve entire\nrelinquishment of the primary meaning but retains it in part, as (with\nthe previous example but also) in \u201cThe umbrella-holders are\ncoming,\u201d it is precisely the context that tells us that the\ncoming is on the part of an umbrella-holder and also\nthose who are not umbrella-holders (important people over\nwhose heads a large umbrella is being held). Because of the violation,\nthe agency of the movement is understood. There would be a violation\nof anvaya in taking the meaning to apply only to a\nholder.\n\n\nSince it is entirely possible that several umbrella-holders are\ncoming, it must be something broader than \u201csemantic fit\u201d\nthat is violated in this and similar cases.\n\n\u201cIndirect indication\u201d does a lot of work for\nreferentialism, since there are many, many examples where no direct\nreferent is meant but a hearer comprehends a statement and acquires\ntestimonial knowledge. And although Ga\u1e45ge\u015ba resists\noveremployment of the notion, he uses it extensively. Further examples\nconcern the meaning of certain Sanskrit compounds and grammatical\nnumber, when, for instance, a plural form is used while what is meant\nis a single something or other.\n\nNaiy\u0101yikas are hardly the only theorists who employ the tool.\nSome M\u012bm\u0101\u1e43sakas argue that reference is to the\nuniversal, the individual being indicated by\nlak\u1e63a\u1e47\u0101. Ga\u1e45ge\u015ba considers the\nview that it is the universal that is known by\nlak\u1e63a\u1e47\u0101, not the individual, the universal\nas specifying the character of the individual. On the dispute about\nreference to universals or individuals, Naiy\u0101yikas want to agree\nwith all parties, it seems. Importantly, Ga\u1e45ge\u015ba sees\nreference to an individual as invariably to an individual of a kind,\nfor example \u201c(A) cow,\u201d would be to one qualified by\ncowhood: \u201cthe referent is an entity as qualified by a\nuniversal\u201d (2020: 1576). To focus just on the cowhood would be\n\u201cindirect indication,\u201d he says, with the indicator being\nthe individual cow referred to. Pr\u0101bh\u0101karas tend to find no\nuse for lak\u1e63a\u1e47\u0101, since according to them\nreference is holistic, a matter of the entire sentence, and the\nmeanings of the individual words are united in the hearer\u2019s\nmind. Thus it is the radical referentialists who seem to need it\nmost.\n\nIn a remarkable passage, Ga\u1e45ge\u015ba puts forth a core argument\nfor lak\u1e63a\u1e47\u0101 (2020: 1631):\n\n\nObjection:\n\nReference (\u015bakti = abhidh\u0101) is alone\nsufficient (with no need to posit an additional mode of meaning),\nsince the conventional practice that supports anyone's understanding\nmeaning is common to both (what you call) primary and indicated\nsenses. For, the words (that make up a sentence and statement) having\nbeen put together, an etymological analysis can inform us of the\noverall connection because \u015bakti, the power of\nreference, has accomplished a setting in mind, or settings in mind,\nproduced by the words. Otherwise, there could be neither testimony as\na knowledge source nor speaker\u2019s intention, since this power\ngoverns and regulates them both.\n\nMoreover, if the speaker\u2019s intention is understood (by anyone\nhearing \u201cThe village is in-the-Ga\u1e45g\u0101\u201d), then\nonly reference need be imagined as accounting for the communication\n(no indirect meaning, lak\u1e63a\u1e47\u0101), since that\nis the economical position. Like homonyms such as\n\u2018ak\u1e63a\u2019 (\u201ceye/dice\u201d) and\ncompany, multiplicity of meaning is alone the right view. No\nuneconomical additional mode need be supposed.\n\nGa\u1e45ge\u015ba:\n\nWe answer. If we had to imagine that the word\n\u2018Ga\u1e45g\u0101\u2019 is used (as you claim) for the\nthousands of things that could be indicated by using the word for such\na thing as a bank, then in order to understand a usage we would have\nto be familiar with another conventional practice of older persons\n(who have taught us the conventions of language) in each case among\nall the innumerable things that could be indicated. And so this view\nis uneconomical, and it is not borne out by experience.\n\nIndirect meaning (lak\u1e63a\u1e47\u0101), on the other\nhand, is single, unitary, by nature to be related to what is picked\nout. And it does not require us to be familiar with another\nconventional practice of of older persons having the indicated as\nintentional object. Thus to have an economical position, it alone is\nappropriately posited.\n\n\nWithout lak\u1e63a\u1e47\u0101, reference would have to do\ntoo much work and could not tie use of a word to a certain type of\nthing. It is to save the fixity of the referential tie that\nlak\u1e63a\u1e47\u0101 has to be posited. Its usefulness as\na concept depends on its flexibility.\n\nGa\u1e45ge\u015ba also swims against the mainstream by eschewing\nknowledge of speaker\u2019s intention to explain the triggering of\nlak\u1e63a\u1e47\u0101. He points out that typically one\nhas to understand a statement before knowing the speaker\u2019s\nintention in making it. A hearer\u2019s knowing the speaker\u2019s\nintention is not a necessary factor in the generation of the\nhearer\u2019s testimonial knowledge through indirect indication, he\nsays, but he admits that knowing a speaker\u2019s intention could be\nsufficient.\n\nAbout the principles of transference, he has little to say other than\nto point to \u201crelevant context\u201d and \u201cbeing set in\nmind quickly.\u201d Indirect indication is preceded by comprehension\nof conventional meaning and is directed toward something that is\nrelated to the conventional meaning. But some cases,\n\u201cfrozen metaphors,\u201d are reconventionalizations where the\nprimary, original meaning has been forgotten. A \u201cwindfall\u201d\nseems to be a good example in modern English. There is a long and\nintricate discussion of this. Can we refer to a water-lily by using\nthe word \u2018mud-born\u2019? No, says Ga\u1e45ge\u015ba. The word\nhas been reconventionalized to mean in a primary way only lotuses and\nif used for a water-lily we would have a case of\nlak\u1e63a\u1e47\u0101.\n",
