    "main_text": "The Construction of Matter, Space, and Time\n9. The Construction of Matter, Space, and Time\n\nWhether or not they are provided with contextual definitions by\nWhitehead and Russell, logical constructions do not appear as the\nreferents of logically proper names, and so by that account\nconstructions are not a part of the fundamental\n\u201cfurniture\u201d of the world. Early critical discussions of\nconstructions, such as Wisdom (1931), stressed the contrast between\nlogically proper names, which do refer, and constructions, which were\nthus seen as ontologically innocent.\n\nBeginning with The Problems of Philosophy in 1912, Russell\nturned repeatedly to the problem of matter. As has been described by\nOmar Nasim (2008), Russell was stepping into an ongoing discussion of\nthe relation of sense data to matter that was being carried on by T.P.\nNunn (1910), Samuel Alexander (1910), G.F. Stout (1914), and G.E.\nMoore (1914), among others. The participants of this \u201cEdwardian\ncontroversy\u201d, as Nasim terms it, shared a belief that direct\nobjects of perception, with their sensory qualities, were nonetheless\nextra-mental. The concept of matter, then, was the result of a loosely\ndescribed social or psychological \u201cconstruction\u201d, going\nbeyond what was directly perceived. A project shared by the\nparticipants in the controversy was the search for a refutation of\nGeorge Berkeley\u2019s idealism, which would show how the existence\nand real nature of matter can be discovered. In The Problems of\nPhilosophy (Russell 1912) Russell argues that the belief in the\nexistence of matter is a well supported hypothesis that explains our\nexperiences. Matter is known only indirectly, \u201cby\ndescription\u201d, as the cause, whatever it may be, of our sense\ndata, which we directly know by \u201cby acquaintance\u201d. This is\nan example of the sort of hypothesis that Russell contrasts with\nconstruction in the famous passage about \u201ctheft\u201d and\n\u201chonest toil\u201d. Russell saw an analogy between the case of\nsimply hypothesizing the existence of numbers with certain properties,\nthose described by axioms, and hypothesizing the existence of\nmatter.\n\nThe need for some sort of account of the logical features of matter,\nwhat he called \u201cthe problem of matter\u201d, had already\noccupied Russell much earlier. While we distinguish the certain\nknowledge we may have of mathematical entities from the contingent\nknowledge of material objects, Russell says that there are certain\n\u201cneat\u201d features of matter that are just too tidy to have\nturned out by accident. Examples include the most general\nspatiotemporal properties of objects, that no two can occupy the same\nplace at the same time, which he calls \u201cimpenetrability\u201d,\nand so on. In The Principles of Mathematics (Russell 1903,\n\u00a7453) there is a list of these features of matter including\n\u201cindestructibility\u201d, \u201cingenerability\u201d and\n\u201cimpenetrability\u201d, which were all characteristic of the\natomic theory of the day. Russell followed the progression through the\nexact sciences from logic through arithmetic, and then real numbers\nand then to infinite cardinals. There followed a discussion of space\nand time, with the book ending with a last part (VII) on Matter and\nMotion, chapters \u00a753 to \u00a759. In them Russell discusses what\nhe calls \u201crational Dynamics as a branch of pure\nmathematics\u201d (Russell 1903, \u00a7437). This rational\nDynamics, would involve justifying many of the fundamental\nprinciples of physics with pure mathematics alone, from definitions\nthat yield the geometry of space and time and the formal properties of\nits occupants, quantities of matter and energy. In this respect the\nconstruction of matter most resembles the construction of numbers as\nclasses as an effort to replace the \u201ctheft\u201d of postulating\naxioms with the \u201chonest toil\u201d of devising definitions that\nwill validate those postulates. \n\nIn the later project of constructing matter, from 1914 on, beginning\nwith Our Knowledge of the External World (Russell 1914b),\nmaterial objects come to be seen as collections of sense data, then of\n\u201csensibilia\u201d. Sensibilia are potential objects of\nsensation, which, when perceived become \u201csense data\u201d for\nthe perceiver. Influenced by William James, Russell came to defend a\nneutral monism by which matter and minds were both to be\nconstructed from sensibilia, but in different ways. Intuitively, the\nsense data occurring as they do \u201cin\u201d a mind, are material\nto construct that mind, the sense data derived from an object from\ndifferent points of view to construct that object. Russell saw some\nsupport for this in the theory of relativity, and the fundamental\nimportance of frames of reference in the new physics.\n\nIn the passage in Our Knowledge of the External World quoted\nabove, Russell acknowledges that Whitehead initiated the project of\n\u201cconstructing\u201d points and instants of time as classes of\noverlapping events, that is, regions of space and intervals\nof time. Whitehead had developed the logical foundations of theories\nof mathematical physics in his \u201cOn Mathematical Concepts of the\nMaterial World\u201d (Whitehead 1906). There he considered\nalternative definitions based on different conceptions of projective\ngeometry, in which lines can be seen as classes of points, or else\npoints as where lines intersect. Whitehead then went on to propose the\nmethod of  extensive abstraction (Whitehead 1920, Chapter 4)\nwhich follows the construction of numbers as classes of equivalence\nclasses. Whitehead\u2019s project was to construct points of the\nspace-time of relativity theory from nested classes of classes of\nevents. Discussions of difficulties for this project began in the\n1920s, including a variant that Whitehead himself proposed in \nProcess and Reality (1929). See de Laguna (1922), Bostock (2010)\nand Varzi (2021) for the history of these proposals. \n\nRussell first constructed moments of time as classes: \n\nThe assumptions made regarding time-relations in the above are as\nfollows:\n\n\nI. In order to secure that instants form a series, we assume: (a) No\nevent wholly precedes itself. (An \u201cevent\u201d is defined as\nwhatever is simultaneous with something or other.) (b) If one event\nwholly precedes another, and the other wholly precedes a third, then\nthe first wholly precedes the third. (c) If one event wholly precedes\nanother, it is not simultaneous with it. (d) Of two events which are\nnot simultaneous, one must wholly precede the other. \n\nII. In order to secure that the initial contemporaries of a given\nevent should form an instant, we assume: (e) An event wholly after\nsome contemporary of a given event is wholly after some \ninitial contemporary of the given event. \n\nIII. In order to secure that the series of instants shall be compact,\nwe assume: (f) If one event wholly precedes another, there is an event\nwholly after the one and simultaneous with something wholly before the\nother. \n\nThis assumption entails the consequence that if one event covers the\nwhole stretch of time immediately preceding another event, then it\nmust have at least one instant in common with the other event; \ni.e. it is impossible for one event to cease just before another\nbegins. I do not know whether this should be regarded as inadmissable.\nFor a mathematico-logical treatment of the above topics,  cf \nN. Wiener, \u201cA Contribution to the Theory of relative\nposition,\u201d  Proc. Camb. Phil. Soc., xvii 5, pp.\n441\u2013449. (Russell 1914b, 120n) \n\n\nSee Anderson (1989) for a discussion of Norbert Wiener\u2019s\ncontribution to this account in (Wiener 1914b). Wiener (1921)\napproached the issue of the sensation of  intensive qualities\nusing the idea of  just noticeable differences  originally\nproposed by Fechner (1860). (See the entry on\n measurement in science.)\n The difference of loudness of sounds, intensity of heat sensations,\nor brightness of lights was previously contrasted with  extensive\nqualities  such as length and weight. Fechner\u2019s idea was\nthat intensive qualities could be seen as composed of parts, detected\nas just noticeable differences, and their number counted to measure\nthe quality. Wiener made use of Russell\u2019s ontology of \nsensibilia, or potential sense data, counting the shortest path\nthrough a space of just noticeable differences. \n",
