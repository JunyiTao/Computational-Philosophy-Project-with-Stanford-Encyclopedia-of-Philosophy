    "main_text": "\n\nParmenides of Elea, active in the earlier part of the 5th c. BCE,\nauthored a difficult metaphysical poem that has earned him a\nreputation as early Greek philosophy\u2019s most profound and\nchallenging thinker. His philosophical stance has typically been\nunderstood as at once extremely paradoxical and yet crucial for the\nbroader development of Greek natural philosophy and metaphysics. He\nhas been seen as a metaphysical monist (of one stripe or another) who\nso challenged the na\u00efve cosmological theories of his predecessors\nthat his major successors among the Presocratics were all driven to\ndevelop more sophisticated physical theories in response to his\narguments. The difficulties involved in the interpretation of his poem\nhave resulted in disagreement about many fundamental questions\nconcerning his philosophical views, such as: whether he actually was a\nmonist and, if so, what kind of monist he was; whether his system\nreflects a critical attitude toward earlier thinkers such as the\nMilesians, Pythagoreans, and Heraclitus, or whether he was motivated\nsimply by more strictly logical concerns, such as the paradox of\nnegative existentials that Bertrand Russell detected at the heart of\nhis thought; whether he considered the world of our everyday\nawareness, with its vast population of entities changing and affecting\none another in all manner of ways, to be simply an illusion, and thus\nwhether the lengthy cosmological portion of his poem represented a\ngenuine attempt to understand this world at all. This entry aims to\nprovide an overview of Parmenides\u2019 work and of some of the major\ninterpretive approaches advanced over the past few decades. It\nconcludes by suggesting that understanding his thought and his place\nin the development of early Greek philosophy requires taking due\naccount of the fundamental modal distinctions that he was the first to\narticulate and explore with any precision.\n",
