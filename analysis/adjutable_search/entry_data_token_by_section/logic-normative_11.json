    "main_text": "Bridge principles || The Preface Paradox\n4.2 The Preface Paradox\n\nGiven that the Preface Paradox constitutes a major stumbling block for\nmany otherwise plausible principles, we do well to explore the ways in\nwhich the Preface Paradox might be dealt with.  One way, of course, of\ndealing with the Preface Paradox is to deny it its force.  That is,\none might try to outright solve, or in some way dissolve, the\nparadox. Since it seems fair to say that no such approach has won the\nday (see entry\n epistemic paradoxes),\n I will assume that the Preface Paradox intuitions are to be take\n seriously.[20]\n\n\nAlternatively, one might acknowledge the force of the Preface\nintuitions while at the same time trying to hold on to a strict,\nought-based principle. But how? According to all such principles, I,\nthe author of a non-trivial non-fiction book (let us assume), ought to believe (or at\nleast not disbelieve) the conjunction of the propositions in my book,\ngiven that I firmly endorse each conjunct individually.\nMacFarlane\u2019s response is that we must simply reconcile ourselves\nto the irreconcilable: the existence of an ineliminable normative conflict. Our strict\nlogical obligations clash with other epistemic obligations, namely,\nthe obligation to believe that some of my beliefs must be mistaken.\nOur agent becomes a tragic heroine. Through no fault of her own, she\nfinds herself in a situation in which, no matter what she does, she\nwill fall short of what, epistemically speaking, she ought to do.\n\nIt might be retorted that, as a matter of sound methodology, admitting\nan irresolvable normative clash should only be our last resort. A\nbetter approach (all other things being equal) would consist in\nfinding a way of reconciling the conflicting epistemic norms.\n\nAmong the qualitative principles we have been considering, the only\nway out is via non-strict principles like (Wr+b*), which we considered\nat the end of the previous section. On this principle, I, the author,\nmerely have reason (as opposed to having sufficient reason) for\nbelieving the conjunction of the claims that make up the body of my\nbook, given that I believe each of the claims individually. The\ncrucial difference resides in the fact that this leaves open the\npossibility that my reason for being logically coherent can be\noverridden. In particular, it can be outweighed by reasons stemming\nfrom other epistemic norms. In the case at hand, it might be thought\nthat our logical obligations are superseded by a norm of epistemic\nmodesty. This, of course, is not uncontroversial. Some maintain that\nwhat the Preface Paradox shows is not merely that the normative grip\nof logic does not take the form of a strict ought, but rather\nthat we in fact have no reason at all to believe in\nmulti-premise closure of belief under logical consequence: my reasons\nfor believing in the conjunction of my claims are not being trumped by\nweightier reasons for disbelieving it; I have no logic-based reason\nwhatsoever to believe the conjunction in the first place.\n\nSo far, then, we have considered the following reactions to the\nPreface Paradox: reject the Preface Paradox altogether; follow\nMacFarlane and cling to the strict ought-based principle at the cost\nof accepting an irresolvable normative clash; or opt for the weaker\nreason operator and give up the intuition motivating the\n Strictness Test.\n But none of these proposals incorporates what is perhaps the most\nnatural response to the Preface Paradox outside of the debate\nsurrounding the normativity of logic. A standard response to the\nPreface Paradox consists in appealing to graded credal states in lieu\nof \u201cfull\u201d (\u201cqualitative\u201d, \u201cbinary\u201d\nor \u201call-or-nothing\u201d) beliefs. Such \u201ccredences\u201d\nor \u201cdegrees of belief\u201d (I will use the two labels\ninterchangeably) are typically modeled by means of a (possibly\npartial) credence function (which we will denote by\n\u201c\\(cr\\)\u201d) that maps the set of propositions into the unit\ninterval. Probabilists maintain that an ideally rational\nagent\u2019s credence function ought to be (or at least ought to be\nextendable to) a probability function (i.e., it ought to satisfy the\nstandard axioms of probability theory). In other words, an ideally\nrational agent should have probabilistically coherent credences.\n\nProbabilists have no trouble accounting for the Preface phenomena: the\nsubjective probability of a (large) conjunction may well be\nlow\u2014even zero, as in the case of the Lottery Paradox (see entry\n epistemic paradoxes)\u2014even\nif the probability assigned to each of the individual conjuncts is\nvery high (reflecting the high degree of confidence the author rightly\nhas in each of her claims).\n\nA tempting strategy for formulating a bridge principle capable of\ncoping with the Preface Paradox is to incorporate these insights. This\nmight be done by going beyond MacFarlane\u2019s classification and\ndevising instead a quantitative bridge principle: one in\nwhich logical principles directly constrain the agent\u2019s degrees\nof belief (as opposed to constraining her full beliefs).\n\nHartry Field (2009a,b, 2015} proposes a bridge principles of just this\nform. Here is a formulation of such a principle:\n\n(DB)  If\n\\(A_{1}, \\dots, A_{n} \\models C\\), then \\(S\\)\u2019s degrees of\nbelief ought to be such that: \\(cr(C) \\geq \\sum_{1 \\leq i \\leq n}\ncr(A_{i}) - (n - 1)\\) \n\n\nNote first that\n DB\n is a wide scope principle: it requires that our degrees of belief\nrespect the specified inequality, which can be achieved in one of two\nways: by suitably raising one\u2019s degree of belief in the\nconclusion or else by readjusting one\u2019s degrees of belief in the\npremises.\n\nDB\n is based on a well-known result in probability logic, which is\nusually stated in terms of \u201cuncertainties\u201d (see Adams 1998\nfor more details; for a helpful overview, see H\u00e1jek 2001).\nDefine the uncertainty of a proposition \\(A\\), \\(u(A)\\) as\n\\(u(A) = 1-cr(A)\\). Put in this way,\n DB\n says that the uncertainty of the conclusion must not exceed the sum of the uncertainties of the premises.\n DB\n can be seen to share a number of important features with standard\nprobability theory. Plug in \\(0\\) for \\(n\\) and you get that one\nshould assign \\(1\\) to any logical truth. Plug in \\(1\\) and you get\nthat one\u2019s degree of belief in the premise of a valid\nsingle-premise argument should not exceed your degree of belief in the\nconclusion. The idea underlying\n DB\n is that uncertainties can add up and therefore need to be accounted\nfor when we are trying to determine how the logical relations between\nour belief contents should affect our degrees of belief in those\ncontents. Even if my uncertainty about each of a large number of\npremises is next to negligible when taken individually, the\nuncertainty may accumulate so as to make the conclusion highly\n(perhaps even maximally) uncertain. It is for this reason that\n DB\n gets us around the Preface Paradox; in the Preface case the number of\npremises is sufficiently high for the conclusion to admit of a very\nlow credence.\n",
