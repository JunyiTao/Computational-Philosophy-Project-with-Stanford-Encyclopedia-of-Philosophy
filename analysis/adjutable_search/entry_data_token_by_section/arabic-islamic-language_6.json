    "main_text": "Logical Doctrines under Dispute\n2. Logical Doctrines under Dispute\n\n\nOf many possible candidates for consideration, the discussions around\nthree logical doctrines seem to me to be particularly instructive. The\nfirst has to do with the subject matter of logic, something which\nneeds to be identified if there is any prospect of presenting logic as\na science (something most parties to the debate at least claim to\nwant). The doctrine associated with Avicenna as to the subject matter\nof logic came to have decisive impact in the Latin logical tradition,\nthough it was not the only doctrine in play through the later Arabic\ntexts. The second and related set of doctrines has to do with offering\nan account of how the various logical disciplines\u2014demonstration,\ndialectic, rhetoric and poetics\u2014fit together. Inherited\nexpectations of what disciplines a logical treatise should cover came\nunder pressure from new disciplines derived from grammar and law;\nultimately, the disciplines of dialectic, rhetoric and poetics were no\nlonger treated in the ways they had been in the Aristotelian\ntradition. Finally, modal syllogistic was perhaps the most keenly\ndisputed topic in logic through the twelfth and thirteenth centuries,\nand I offer an overview of one line of discussion which took place. I\nlook in particular at arguments coming from eastern Iran in the\nthirteenth century\u2014a tradition I call Maragha logic \n(see 1.5.2 above)\u2014because this was a period of particularly intense\nlogical activity culminating in textbooks overwhelmingly important in\nthe subsequent teaching of the discipline.\nLet me go on immediately to acknowledge that these may not be the\nmost philosophically sophisticated or historically representative\ndiscussions which took place in the Arabic tradition (see e.g., Hodges\n2011a (in Other Internet Resources) on the subject matter of\nlogic). They do however all have the advantage of having been\ndiscussed by a number of Arabic logicians through the centuries, and\nof having been the subject of at least some academic study. Other\ncandidate topics illustrate what I seek to avoid. Consider the\nimpressive work by Avicenna on proof theory which has been translated\nand analysed by Hodges (2009, Other Internet Resources); to the extent\nthat I can follow this work, it exhibits a truly extraordinary level\nof logical acumen. At the same time I have never\u2014in my\nadmittedly narrow reading in the tradition\u2014seen another logician\ndevelop or even use Avicenna's results in this area. In short, the\ntopic illustrates Avicenna's logical genius rather than a common theme\nrunning through Arabic logic.\nConsider next the work in the Avicennan tradition on syllogisms\nwith conditional and disjunctive premises (see 1.3 above). This\nimportant material is original to Avicenna, used among other things in the\nanalysis of the reductio argument. If we consult\nKh\u00fbnaj\u00ee's Disclosure, we find one quarter of the\nwork's four hundred pages given over to syllogisms with conditional or\ndisjunctive premises, developing the subject far beyond Avicenna's\noriginal insights in the Cure (and often in a manner fairly\ndismissive of Avicenna's work).  Kh\u00fbnaj\u00ee clearly looked on\nhis modifications to this part of Avicenna's logic as central to his\nproject, and his modifications were adopted by later logicians like\nK\u00e2tib\u00ee. If anything, this would be a better topic than the\nmodals to illustrate the distinctive characteristics of the\ndiscussions that went on in Arabic logic. In the present state of the\nfield, however, although there have been major studies of Avicenna's\nsyllogistic with hypothetical premises (e.g., Rescher 1963c; Shehaby\n1973; G\u00e4tje 1985), there is none at all\u2014to the best of\nmy knowledge\u2014on its reception and modification in the subsequent\ntradition. One or both of these reasons (that is, neglect by the\nsubsequent tradition and neglect in the secondary literature) rule out\nother major topics such as the theory of demonstration and what might\nbe called meta-syllogistic (but see, on the first, Hasnawi 2008;\nStrobino 2010, 2012; and on the second, El-Rouayheb\n2009; Hodges 2011c (in Other Internet Resources)).\n",
