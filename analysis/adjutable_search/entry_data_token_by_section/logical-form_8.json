    "main_text": "Semantic Structure and Events\n10. Further Questions\n\nAt this point, many issues become relevant to further discussions of\nlogical form. Most obviously, there are questions concerning\nparticular examples. Given just about any sentence of natural\nlanguage, one can ask interesting questions (that remain unsettled)\nabout its logical form. There are also very abstract questions about\nthe relation of semantics to logic. Should we follow Davidson and\nMontague, among others, in characterizing theories of meaning for\nnatural languages as theories of truth (that perhaps satisfy certain\nconditions on learnability)? Is an algorithm that correctly associates\nsentences with truth-conditions (relative to contexts) necessary\nand/or sufficient for being an adequate theory of meaning? What should\nwe say about the paradoxes apparently engendered by sentences like\n\u2018This sentence is false\u2019? If we allow for second-order\nlogical forms, how should we understand second-order quantification,\ngiven Russell\u2019s Paradox? Are claims about the \u201csemantic\nstructure\u201d of a sentence fundamentally descriptive claims about\nspeakers (or their communities, or their languages)? Or is there an\nimportant sense in which claims about semantic structure are normative\nclaims about how we should use language? Are facts about the\nacquisition of language germane to hypotheses about logical form? And\nof course, the history of the subject reveals that the answers to the\ncentral questions are by no means obvious: what is logical structure,\nwhat is grammatical structure, and how are they related? Or put\nanother way, what kinds of structures do propositions and sentences\nexhibit, and how do thinkers/speakers relate them?\n",
