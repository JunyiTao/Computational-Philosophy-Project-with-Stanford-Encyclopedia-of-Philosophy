By\nrepresenting a genotype as a point on a multidimensional landscape,\nwhere the \u201cheight\u201d of the landscape corresponds to its\nfitness, the model has been used to study evolutionary paths of\npopulations.\n\nThe idea of epistemic landscapes entered philosophy of\nscience with the work of Weisberg and Muldoon (2009) and Grim (2009).\nIn this reinterpretation of the model, the landscape represents a\nresearch topic, consisting of multiple projects or multiple\nhypotheses. A research topic can be understood either in a narrow\nsense (e.g., the study of treatments for a certain disease) or in a\nbroader sense (e.g., the field of astrophysics). A point on the\nlandscape stands for a certain hypothesis or a specific approach to\ninvestigating the topic. Approaches can vary in terms of different\nbackground assumptions, methods of inquiry, research questions, etc.\nAccordingly, the landscape can be modeled in terms of \\(n\\)\ndimensions, where \\(n-1\\) dimensions represent different aspects of\nscientific approaches, while the \\(n^{th}\\) dimension (visualized as\nthe \u201cheight\u201d of the landscape) stands for some measure of\nepistemic value an agent gets by pursuing the corresponding approach.\nFor instance, in case of a three-dimensional landscape, the x\nand y coordinates form a two-dimensional disciplinary matrix in\nwhich approaches are situated, while z coordinate measures\ntheir \u201cepistemic significance\u201d (see\n Figure 2).\n The latter can be understood in line with Kitcher\u2019s idea that\nsignificant approaches are those that enable the conceptual and\nexplanatory progress of science (Kitcher 1993: 95).\n\nABMs of science have utilized two-dimensional and three-dimensional\nlandscapes, as well as the generalized framework of NK-landscapes, in\nwhich the number of dimensions and the ruggedness of the landscape are\nparameters of the\n model.[1]\n Scientists are modeled as agents who explore the landscape, trying to\nfind its peak(s), that is, the epistemically most significant points.\nThe framework allows for different ways of measuring the success and\nefficiency of inquiry: in terms of the success of the community in\ndiscovering the peak(s) of the landscape (rather than getting stuck in\nlocal maxima), the success in discovering any of the areas of non-zero\nvicinity, the time required for such discoveries, and so forth.\n\n\n\nFigure 2: Two representations of\nWeisberg and Muldoon\u2019s epistemic landscape: a three-dimensional\nrepresentation on the left and a two-dimensional representation of the\nsame landscape on the right, where the height of the landscape is\nrepresented by different shades of gray: the lighter the shade, the\nmore significant the point on the landscape (adapted from Weisberg\n& Muldoon 2009). \n\n3.1.1 Application to the problem of cognitive diversity\n\nThe framework of epistemic landscapes has been applied to a variety of\nresearch questions in philosophy of science. Weisberg and Muldoon\n(2009) introduced it to examine the impact of cognitive diversity on\nthe performance of scientific communities. What makes the epistemic\nlandscape framework particularly attractive for the study of cognitive\ndiversity and the division of labor is its capacity to represent\nvarious research strategies (as different heuristics of exploring the\nlandscape), as well as a coordinated distribution of research efforts\n(cf. P\u00f6yh\u00f6nen 2017).\n\nWeisberg and Muldoon\u2019s ABM employs a three-dimensional landscape\n(see\n Figure 2),\n built on a discrete toroidal grid, with two peaks representing the\nhighest points of epistemic significance. To study cognitive\ndiversity, the model examines three research strategies, implemented\nas three types of agents:\n\nThe \u201ccontrols\u201d who aim to find a higher point on the\nlandscape than their current location, while ignoring the exploration\nof other agents.\nThe \u201cfollowers\u201d who aim to find already explored\napproaches in their direct neighborhood, which have a higher\nsignificance than their current location.\nThe \u201cmavericks\u201d who also aim to find points of higher\nsignificance given previously explored points, but rather than\nfollowing in the footsteps of other scientists, they prioritize the\ndiscovery of new, so far unvisited, points.\n\n\nThe control strategy represents individual learning that disregards\nsocial information, while the follower and the maverick strategies\nrepresent different ways of taking the latter into account. The model\nexamines how homogeneous populations of each type of explorers, or\nheterogeneous populations consisting of diverse groups of explorers,\nimpact the efficiency of the community in discovering the highest\npoints on the landscape, and in covering all points of non-zero\nsignificance.\n\nFollowing Weisberg and Muldoon\u2019s contribution, the framework of\nepistemic landscapes became highly influential, resulting in various\nrefinements and extensions of the model. For instance, Alexander,\nHimmelreich, and Thompson (2015) introduced the \u201cswarm\u201d\nstrategy, which describes scientists who can with certain probability\nidentify points of higher significance in their surrounding and adjust\ntheir approach so that it is similar, but different from approaches\npursued by others who are close to them. Thoma (2015) introduced\n\u201cexplorer\u201d and \u201cextractor\u201d strategies, the\nformer of which describes a scientist seeking approaches very\ndifferent from those pursued by others, while the latter (similar to\nAlexander and colleagues\u2019 swarm researcher) seeks approaches\nthat are similar to, yet distinct from those pursued by others.\nMoreover, Fern\u00e1ndez Pinto and Fern\u00e1ndez Pinto (2018)\nexamined alternative rules for the follower strategy. Finally,\nP\u00f6yh\u00f6nen (2017) introduced a \u201cdynamic\u201d\nlandscape, such that the exploration of patches \u201cdepletes\u201d\ntheir significance.\n3.1.2 Applications to network epistemology\n\nAnother application domain of the epistemic landscape framework is the\ncommunication structure of science and its impact on communal inquiry.\nTo study these issues Grim and Singer (Grim 2009; Grim, Singer,\nFisher, et al. 2013) developed ABMs employing a two-dimensional\nlandscape, where points on the x-axis represent alternative\nhypotheses for a given domain of phenomena, while the y-axis\nindicates the \u201cepistemic goodness\u201d of each hypothesis or\nthe epistemic payoff an agents gets by pursuing it. Depending on how\nwell the best hypothesis is hidden, the shape of the epistemic terrain\nwill represent a more or less \u201cfiendish\u201d research problem\n(see\n Figure 3).\n For instance, if the best hypothesis is a narrow peak in the\nlandscape (as in\n Figure 3c)\n finding it will resemble a search for a needle in a haystack and\ntherefore a fiendish research\n problem.[2]\n An inquiry is considered successful if any scientist (eventually\nfollowed by the rest of the community) discovers the highest peak on\nthe landscape, while it is unsuccessful if the community converges on\na local maximum. The model is used to study how different social\nnetworks with varying degrees of connectedness (such as those in\n Figure 1),\n and different epistemic landscapes with different degrees of\nfiendishness impact the success of inquiry.\n\n\n\n(a)\n\n\n\n\n(b)\n\n\n\n\n(c)\n\nFigure 3: Epistemic landscapes with an\nincreasing degree of fiendishness (adapted from Grim, Singer, Fisher,\net al. 2013: 443)\n\n3.1.3 Other applications\n\nBeside the above themes, the framework of epistemic landscapes has\nappeared in many other variants. For instance, De Langhe (2014a)\nproposed an ABM aimed at studying different notions of scientific\nprogress, which makes use of a \u201cmoving epistemic\nlandscape\u201d: a landscape in which the significance of approaches\ncan change as a result of exploration of other approaches. Balietti,\nM\u00e4s, and Helbing (2015) developed an epistemic landscape model to\nstudy the relationship between fragmentation in scientific communities\nand scientific progress, in which agents explore a two-dimensional\nlandscape, representing a space of possible answers to a certain\nresearch question, with the correct answer located at the center of\nthe landscape. Currie and Avin (2019) proposed a reinterpretation of\nthe three-dimensional landscape aimed at studying the diversity of\nscientific methods, in which the x and y axis stand for\ndifferent investigative techniques or methods of acquiring evidence,\nand the z axis for the \u201csharpness\u201d of the obtained\nevidence. Sharpness here refers to the relationship between research\nresults and a hypothesis, where the more the evidence increases\none\u2019s credence in the hypothesis, the sharper it is. The model\nalso represents the \u201cindependence\u201d of evidence as the\ndistance between two points on the landscape according to the x\nand y coordinates: the further apart two methods are, the less\noverlapping their background theories are, and the more independent\nthe evidence obtained by them is.\n\nFinally, epistemic landscape modeling has inspired related landscape\nmodels. The argumentation-based model of scientific inquiry by Borg,\nFrey, \u0160e\u0161elja, and Stra\u00dfer (2018, 2019) is one\nsuch example. The model, inspired by abstract argumentation frameworks\n(Dung 1995), employs an \u201cargumentation landscape\u201d. The\nlandscape is composed of \u201cargumentation trees\u201d that\nrepresent rival research programs (see\n Figure 4).\n Each program is a rooted tree, with nodes as arguments and edges as a\n\u201cdiscovery relation\u201d, representing a path agents take to\nmove from one argument to another. Arguments in one theory may attack\narguments in another theory. In contrast to epistemic landscapes,\nargumentation landscapes aim to capture the dialectic dimension of\ninquiry where some points on the landscape, assumed to be acceptable\narguments, may subsequently be rejected as undefendable. This allows\nfor an explicit representation of false positives (accepting a false\nhypothesis) as an argument on the landscape an agent accepts without\nknowing there exists an attack on it, and false negatives (rejecting a\ntrue hypothesis) as an argument an agent rejects, without knowing that\nit can be defended. The model has been used to study how argumentative\ndynamics among scientists, pursuing rival research programs, impacts\ntheir efficiency in acquiring knowledge under various conditions of\ninquiry (such as different social networks, different degrees of\ncautiousness in decision making, and so on).\n\n\n\nFigure 4: Argumentation-based ABM by\nBorg, Frey, \u0160e\u0161elja, and Stra\u00dfer (2019) employing\nan argumentative landscape. The landscape represents two rival\nresearch programs (RP), with darker shaded nodes standing for\narguments that have been explored by agents and are thus visible to\nthem; brighter shaded nodes stand for arguments that are not visible\nto agents. The biggest node in each RP is the root argument, from\nwhich agents start their exploration via the discovery relation,\nconnecting arguments within one RP. Arrows stand for attacks from an\nargument in one RP to an argument in another RP.\n\n3.2 Bandit models\n\nIn the previous section we saw how epistemic landscape models have\nbeen used to represent inquiries involving mutually compatible\nresearch projects (as in Weisberg and Muldoon\u2019s model) as well\nas inquiries involving rival hypotheses (as in Grim and Singer\u2019s\nmodel). Another framework used to study the latter scenario is based\non \u201cbandit problems\u201d.\n\nThe name of bandit models comes from the term \u201cone-armed\nbandit\u201d\u2014a colloquial name for a slot machine. Multi-armed\nbandit problems, introduced in statistics (Robbins 1952; Berry &\nFristedt 1985) and studied in economics (Bala & Goyal 1998; Bolton\n& Harris 1999), are decision-making problems that concern the\nfollowing kind of scenario: suppose a gambler is about to play several\nslot machines. Each machine gives a random payoff according to a\nprobability distribution unknown to the gambler. To determine which\nmachine will give a higher reward in the long run, the gambler has to\nexperiment by pulling arms of the machines. This will allow her to\nlearn from the obtained results. But which strategy should she use?\nFor instance, should she alternate between the machines for the first\ncouple of pulls, and then play only the machine that has given the\nhighest reward during the initial test run? Or should she rather have\na lengthy test phase before deciding which machine is better? While in\nthe first case she might start exploiting her current\nknowledge before she has sufficiently explored, in the second\ncase she might explore for too long. In this way the gambler faces a\ntrade-off between exploitation (playing the machine that has so far\ngiven the best payoff) and exploration (continued testing of different\nmachines). The challenge is thus to come up with the strategy that\nprovides an optimal balance between exploration and exploitation, so\nas to maximize one\u2019s total winnings.\n\nAs we have seen above (see\n Section 2.2),\n the exploration/exploitation trade-off may also occur in the context\nof scientific research. Whether scientists are attempting to determine\nif a novel treatment for a disease is superior to an existing one, or\nselecting between two novel methods of evidence gathering with varying\nsuccess rates, they may encounter the exploration/exploitation\ntrade-off. In other words, they may have to decide when to cease\nexploring alternatives and begin exploiting the one that appears most\nsuitable for the task.\n\nABMs based on bandit problems were first introduced to philosophy of\nscience by Zollman (2007, 2010). A bandit ABM usually looks as\nfollows. In analogy to slot machines, each scientific theory (or\nhypothesis, or method) is represented as having a designated\nprobability of success. Scientists are typically modeled as\n\u201cmyopic\u201d agents in the sense that they always pursue a\ntheory they believe to give a higher payoff. They gather evidence for\na theory by making a random draw from a probability distribution.\nSubsequently, they update their beliefs in a Bayesian way, on the\nbasis of results of their own research (the gathered evidence) as well\nas results of neighboring scientists in their social network (such as\nthose in\n Figure 1).\n Scientists are thus not modeled as passive observers of evidence for\nall the available theories, but rather as agents who actively\ndetermine the type of evidence they gather by choosing which theory to\npursue. The inquiry of the community is considered successful if, for\nexample, scientists reach a consensus on the better of the two\ntheories.\n\nBandit models of this kind build on the analytical framework developed\nby economists (Bala & Goyal 1998) who examined the relationship\nbetween different communication networks in infinite populations and\nthe process of social learning. Applied to the context of science,\nthis variation of bandit problems concerns the puzzle mentioned above\nin\n Section 2.2:\n assuming a scientific community is trying to determine which of the\ntwo available hypotheses offers a better treatment for a given\ndisease, could the structure of the information flow among the\nscientists impact their chances of converging on the better\nhypothesis? By applying Bala and Goyal\u2019s framework to the\ncontext of science and scenarios involving finite populations, Zollman\ninitiated the field of network epistemology (see Zollman 2013), which\nstudies the impact of social networks on the process of knowledge\nacquisition.\n\nBeside the aim of examining network effects on the formation of\nscientific consensus, bandit models of scientific interaction have\nbeen applied to a number of other topics, such as the impact of\npreferential attachment on social learning (Alexander 2013), bias and\ndeception in science (Holman & Bruner 2015, 2017; Weatherall,\nO\u2019Connor, & Bruner 2020), optimal forms of collaboration\n(Zollman 2017), factors leading to scientific polarization\n(O\u2019Connor & Weatherall 2018; Weatherall & O\u2019Connor\n2021b), effects of conformity (Weatherall & O\u2019Connor 2021a),\neffects of demographic diversity (Fazelpour & Steel 2022),\nregulations of dual-use research (Wagner & Herington 2021), social\nlearning in which a dominant group ignores or devalues testimony from\na marginalized group (Wu 2023), or disagreements on the diagnosticity\nof evidence for a certain hypothesis (Michelini & Osorio et al.\nforthcoming).\n3.3 Bounded confidence models of opinion dynamics\n\nAs we have seen above, the performance of a scientific community is\nsometimes assessed in terms of its success in achieving consensus on\nthe true hypothesis. The question how consensus is formed and which\nfactors benefit or hinder its emergence is also studied within the\ntheme of opinion dynamics in epistemic communities. Models of\nopinion dynamics aim at investigating how opinions form and change in\na group of agents who adjust their views (or beliefs) over a number of\nrounds or time-steps, resulting in the formation of\nconsensus, polarization, or a plurality of\nviews. A modeling framework that has been particularly influential in\nthis context originates from the work of Hegselmann and Krause (2002,\n2005, 2006), drawing its roots from analytical models of consensus\nformation (French 1956; DeGroot 1974; Lehrer & Wagner\n 1981).[3]\n\n\nThe basic model functions as follows. At the start of the simulation\n(that is, at time \\(t=0\\)) each agent \\(x_i\\) is assigned an opinion\non a certain issue, expressed by a real number \\(x_i(0) \\in {(0,1]}\\).\nAgents then exchange their opinions (or beliefs) with others and\nadjust them by taking the average of those beliefs that are \u201cnot\ntoo far away\u201d from their own. These are opinions that fall\nwithin a \u201cconfidence interval\u201d of size \\(\\epsilon\\), which\nis a parameter of the model. In this way, agents have bounded\nconfidence in opinions of others. By iterating this process, the model\nsimulates the social dynamics of the opinion formation (see\n Figure 5a).\n\nApplied to the context of scientific inquiry, scientists are usually\nrepresented as truth seeking agents who are trying to determine the\nvalue of a certain parameter \\(\\tau\\) for which they only know that it\nlies in the interval \\((0,1]\\) (Hegselmann & Krause 2006). At the\nstart of the simulation each agent is assigned a random initial\nbelief. As the model runs, agents adjust their beliefs by receiving a\n(noisy) signal about \\(\\tau\\) and by learning opinions of others who\nfall within their confidence interval. For instance, an agent\u2019s\nbelief can be updated in terms of the weighted average of\nothers\u2019 opinions and the signal from the\n world.[4]\n Such dynamics represent scientists as agents who are able to generate\nevidence that points in the direction of \\(\\tau\\), though their\nupdates are also influenced by their prior beliefs and the beliefs of\ntheir peers (see\n Figure 5b\n &\n Figure 5c).\n\n\n\n(a)\n\n\n\n\n(b)\n\n\n\n\n(c)\n\nFigure 5: Examples of runs of Hegselmann\nand Krause\u2019s model, with the x-axis representing time\nsteps in the simulation and the y-axis opinions of 100 agents.\nThe change of each agent\u2019s opinion is represented with a colored\nline. The value of \\(\\tau\\) (the assumed position of the truth) is\nrepresented as a black dotted line. Figure (a) shows opinion dynamics\nin a community without any truth-seeking agents, resulting in a\nplurality of diverging views. Figure (b) shows the opinion dynamics in\na community in which all agents are truth-seekers, which achieves a\nconsensus close to the truth. Figure (c) shows the opinion dynamics in\na community in which only half of the population are truth-seekers,\nwhich also achieves a consensus close to the truth (adapted from\nHegselmann & Krause 2006; for other parameters used in the\nsimulations see the original article).\n\n\nAn early application of the bounded confidence model was the problem\nof the division of cognitive labor (Hegselmann & Krause 2006).\nSince agents can be modeled as updating their beliefs only on the\nbasis of social information (that is, by averaging over opinions of\nothers who fall in one\u2019s confidence interval) or on the basis of\nboth social information and the signal from the world, the model can\nbe used to study the opinion dynamics in a community in which not\neveryone is a \u201ctruth-seeker\u201d. The model then examines what\nkind of division of labor between truth-seekers and agents who only\nreceive social information allows the community to converge to the\ntruth.\n\nSubsequent applications of the framework in social epistemology and\nphilosophy of science focused on the study of scientific disagreements\nand the question: what is the impact of different norms guiding\ndisagreeing scientists on the efficiency of collective inquiry (Douven\n2010; De Langhe 2013)? If agents update their beliefs both in view of\ntheir own research and in view of other agents\u2019 opinions they\nrepresent scientists that follow a Conciliatory Norm by\n\u201csplitting the difference\u201d between their own view and the\nviews of their peers (see above\n Section 2.5).\n In contrast, if they update their beliefs only in view of their own\nresearch they represent scientists that follow a Steadfast Norm. Other\napplication themes of this framework include the impact of noisy data\non opinion dynamics (Douven & Riegler 2010), opinion dynamics\nconcerning complex belief states, such as beliefs about scientific\ntheories (Riegler & Douven 2009), updating via an inference to the\nbest explanation in a social setting (Douven & Wenmackers 2017),\ndeceit and spread of disinformation (Douven & Hegselmann 2021),\nnetwork effects and theoretical diversity in scientific communities\n(Douven & Hegselmann 2022), and so forth.\n3.4 Evolutionary game-theoretic models of bargaining\n\nGame theory studies situations in which the outcome of one\u2019s\naction depends not only on one\u2019s choice of an action, but also\non actions of others. A \u201cgame\u201d in this sense is a model of\na strategic interaction between agents (\u201cplayers\u201d), each\nof whom has a set of available actions or strategies. Each combination\nof the players\u2019 strategic responses has a designated outcome or\na \u201cpayoff\u201d. In contrast to traditional game theory, which\nfocuses on agents\u2019 rational decision-making aimed at maximizing\ntheir payoff in one-off interactions, the evolutionary approach\nfocuses on repeated interactions in a population. A game is assumed to\nbe played over and over again by players who are randomly drawn from a\nlarge population. While agents start with a certain strategic\nbehavior, they learn and gradually adjust their responses according to\nspecific rules called \u201cdynamics\u201d (for example, by\nimitating other players or by considering their own past\ninteractions). As a result, successful strategies will diffuse across\nthe community. In this way, evolutionary game-theoretic models can be\nused to explain how a distribution of strategies across the population\nchanges over time as an outcome of long-term population-level\nprocesses. While the standard approach to game theory has primarily\nfocused on combinations of players\u2019 strategies that lead to a\n\u201cstable\u201d state, such as the Nash equilibrium\u2014a state\nin which no player can improve their payoff by unilaterally changing\ntheir strategy\u2014the evolutionary approach has been used to study\nhow equilibria emerge in a community (see the entries on\n game theory\n and on\n evolutionary game theory).\n\nEvolutionary game theory was originally introduced in biology\n(Lewontin 1961; Maynard Smith 1982). It subsequently gained interest\nof social scientists and philosophers as a tool for studying cultural\nevolution, that is, for investigations into how beliefs and norms\nchange over time (Axelrod 1984; Skyrms 1996). The models can be\nimplemented using a mathematical treatment based on differential\nequations, or using agent-based modeling. While the former approach\nemploys certain idealizations, such as an infinite population size or\nperfect mixing of populations, ABMs were introduced to study scenarios\nin which such assumptions are relaxed (see, e.g., Adami, Schossau,\n& Hintze 2016).\n\nApplications of evolutionary game theory to social epistemology of\nscience were especially inspired by models of bargaining, studying how\ndifferent bargaining norms emerge from local interactions of\nindividuals (Skyrms 1996; Axtell, Epstein, & Young 2001). The\nframework was introduced to the study of epistemic communities by\nO\u2019Connor and Bruner (2019), building up on Bruner\u2019s (2019)\nmodel of cultural\n interactions.[5]\n\n\nThe basic idea of bargaining models is as follows: agents bargain over\nshares of available resources, where their demands and expectations\nabout others\u2019 demands evolve endogenously in view of their\nprevious interactions. Applied to the context of science, bargaining\nconcerns not only explicit negotiations over financial resources, but\nalso situations in which scientists need to agree how to divide their\nworkload in joint projects (O\u2019Connor & Bruner 2019). For\nexample, if two scientists are working on a joint paper or if they are\norganizing a conference together they will have to agree on how much\ntime and effort each of them will devote to it. The norms determining\nsuch a division of labor may not be fair. For example, if scientist\nA puts much less effort into the project than scientist\nB, but they both get the same recognition for its success,\nB will be disadvantaged. Similarly, if they agree on A\nbeing the first author in a collaborative paper, while B ends\nup working much more on it, the outcome will again be unfair. Such\nnorms may become entrenched in the scientific community, especially in\nthe context of interactions between members of majority and minority\ngroups in academia. But how do such norms emerge? Are biases favoring\nmembers of certain groups over others necessary for the emergence of\nsuch discriminatory patterns, or can they become entrenched due to\nother, perhaps more surprising factors?\n\nEvolutionary game-theoretic models have been used to study these and\nrelated questions. Bargaining is represented as a strategic\ninteraction between two agents, each of whom makes a demand concerning\nthe issue at hand (for instance, a certain amount of workload, the\norder of authors\u2019 names in a joint publication, and so on).\nDepending on each agent\u2019s demand, each gets a certain payoff.\nFor instance, suppose A and B wish to organize a\nconference and they start by negotiating who will cover which tasks.\nIf they both make a high demand in the sense that each is willing to\nput only a minimal effort into the project while expecting the other\nto cover the rest of the tasks, they will fail to organize the event.\nIf B, on the other hand, makes a low demand (by taking on a\nlarger portion of the work) while A makes a high demand, they\nwill be able to organize the conference, though the division of labor\nwill be unfair (assuming they both get equal credit for successfully\nrealizing the project).\n\nThe game, originating in the work of John Nash (1950), is called the\n\u201cNash demand game\u201d (or the \u201cmini-Nash demand\ngame\u201d). Each player in the game makes their demand (Low, Med or\nHigh). If the demands do not jointly exceed a given resource, each\nplayer gets what they asked for. If they do exceed the available\nresource, no-one gets anything. In the example above, High can be\ninterpreted as demanding to work less than the other on the\norganization of the conference, or demanding the first authorship in a\njoint paper while putting relatively lower effort into it. Similarly,\nLow corresponds to the willingness to take on a larger portion of the\nwork (relative to the order of authors in case of the joint paper),\nwhile Med corresponds to demanding a fair distribution of labor.\n Table 1\n displays the payoffs in such a game. Any combination of demands that\ngives a joint payoff of 10 is a Nash equilibrium, which means that\neither player\u2019s strategy is the best response to the other\nplayer\u2019s one. While a Nash equilibrium may correspond to a fair\ndistribution of resources (if both players demand Med), it may also\ncorrespond to an unfair one (if one player demands Low and the other\none High). This raises the question: which equilibrium will the\ncommunity achieve if agents learn from their previous interactions? In\nparticular, if the individuals are divided into sub-groups (which may\nbe of different sizes), where their membership can be identified by\nmeans of markers visible to other agents, they can develop strategies\nconditional on the group membership of their co-players. Which\nequilibrium state will such a community evolve to? To study such\nquestions, evolutionary models employ rules or dynamics that determine\nhow players update their strategies and how the distribution of\nstrategies across the community changes over\n time.[6]\n\n\n\n  \n\n\n\n\nLow\nMed\nHigh  \n\n\nLow\nL,L\nL,5\nL,H \n\nMed\n5,L\n5,5\n0,0 \n\nHigh\nH,L\n0,0\n0,0  \n\n\nTable 1: A payoff table in the Nash\ndemand game. The rows show the strategic options of Player1 and the\ncolumns the options of Player2. Each cell shows the payoff Player1\ngets for the given combination of options, followed by the payoff for\nPlayer2. Players can make three demands: Low, Med and High for the\ntotal resource of 10. The payoffs are represented as L, M and H, where\n\\(\\mathrm{M}= 5\\), \\(\\mathrm{L} < 5 < \\mathrm{H}\\), and\n\\(\\mathrm{L} + \\mathrm{H} = 10\\). (cf. O\u2019Connor & Bruner\n2019; Rubin & O\u2019Connor 2018) \n\n\nThe modeling framework based on bargaining has been used to study\nnorms in scientific collaborations and inequalities that may emerge\nthrough them. For example, O\u2019Connor and Bruner (2019)\ninvestigate the emergence of discriminatory norms in academic\ninteractions between minority and majority members. Rubin and\nO\u2019Connor (2018) study the emergence of discriminatory patterns\nand their effects on diversity in collaboration networks, while\nVentura (2023) examines the impact of the structure of collaborative\nnetworks on the emergence of discriminatory norms even if there are no\nvisible markers of an agent\u2019s membership to a sub-group.\nMoreover, Klein, Marx, and Scheller (2020) use a similar framework to\nstudy the relationship between rationality and inequality, that is,\nthe success of different strategies for bargaining (such as maximizing\nexpected utility) and their impact on the emergence of inequality.\n3.5 Summing up\n\nBesides the above frameworks, numerous additional approaches have been\nused to build simulations in social epistemology and philosophy of\nscience. Some prominent frameworks not mentioned above include the\nBayesian framework \u201cLaputa\u201d developed by Angere\n(2010\u2014in Other Internet Resources) and Olsson (2011), aimed at\nstudying social networks of information and trust, the model of\nargumentation dynamics by Betz (2013), or the influential framework by\nHong and Page (2004) utilized in the study of cognitive diversity (for\nmore on these frameworks see the entry on\n computational philosophy).\n Another evolutionary framework used in philosophy of science was\nproposed by Smaldino and McElreath (2016). The model represents a\nscientific community as a population consisting of scientific labs\nthat employ culturally transmitted methodological practices, where the\npractices undergo natural selection from one generation of scientists\nto the next, and it has been employed, for example, to study the\nselection of conservative and risk-taking science (O\u2019Connor\n2019). In the next section we take a look at some of the central\nresults obtained by ABMs in philosophy of science, based on the above\nand some other frameworks.\n4. Central Results\n\nTo provide an overview of the main findings obtained by means of ABMs\nin philosophy of science, we will revisit the research questions\ndiscussed in\n Section 2\n and look at how they have been answered through specific models.\n4.1 Theoretical diversity and the incentive structure of science\n\nBefore we survey ABMs that study the incentive structure of science,\nwe first look into the results of some analytical models which\ninspired the development of simulations. To get a more precise grip on\nhow individual incentives shape epistemic coordination and theoretical\ndiversity, philosophers introduced formal analytical models, inspired\nby research in economics. One of the central results from this body of\nliterature is that the optimal distribution of labor can be achieved\nwhen scientists act according to their self-interest rather than\nfollowing epistemic ends (e.g., Kitcher 1990; Brock & Durlauf\n1999; Strevens 2003). More precisely, the models show that if we\nassume scientists aim at maximizing rewards from making discoveries,\nthey will succeed to optimally distribute their research efforts if\nthey take into account the probability of success of each research\nline and how many other scientists currently pursue it. Assuming that\nall scientists evaluate theories in the same way, their interest in\nfame and fortune, rather than epistemic goals alone, will lead some of\nthem to select avenues that initially appear less\n promising.[7]\n\n\nABMs were introduced to address similar questions, but assuming more\ncomplex scenarios. For example, Muldoon and Weisberg (2011) developed\nan epistemic landscape model (see\n Section 3.1)\n to examine the robustness of Kitcher\u2019s and Strevens\u2019\nresults under the assumption that scientists have varying access to\ninformation about the pursued research projects in their community and\nthe future success of those projects. Their results indicate that once\nscientists have limited information about what others are working on,\nor about the degree to which projects are likely to succeed, their\nself-organized division of labor fails to be optimal. Another example\nis the model by De Langhe & Greiff (2010) who generalize\nKitcher\u2019s model to a situation with multiple epistemic standards\ndetermining the background assumptions of scientists, acceptable\nmethods, acceptable puzzles, and so on. The simulations show that once\nscientific practice is modeled as based on multiple standards, the\nincentive to compete fails to provide an optimal division of labor.\n\n\nA closely related question concerns the \u201cpriority\nrule\u201d\u2014a norm that allocates credit for a scientific\ndiscovery to the first one to make it (Strevens 2003, 2011)\u2014and\nits impact on the division of labor. While Kitcher\u2019s and\nStrevens\u2019s models suggested that the priority rule incentivizes\nthe optimal distribution of scientists across rival research programs,\na range of formal models, including ABMs, were developed to reexamine\nthese results and shed additional light on this norm. For instance,\nRubin and Schneider (2021) examine what happens if credit is assigned\nby individuals, rather than by the scientific community as a whole, as\nin Strevens\u2019 model. They further suppose that news about\nsimultaneous discoveries by two scientists spreads through a networked\ncommunity. The simulations show that more connected scientists are\nmore likely to gain credit than the less connected ones, which may, on\nthe one hand, disadvantage minority members in the community, and on\nthe other hand, undermine the role of the priority rule as an\nincentive resulting in the optimal division of labor. Besides the\nquestion of how the priority rule impacts the division of labor, ABMs\nhave also been used to study other effects of the priority rule. For\nexample, Tiokhin, Yan, and Morgan (2021) develop an evolutionary ABM\nshowing that the priority rule leads the scientific community to\nevolve towards research based on smaller sample sizes, which in turn\nreduces the reliability of published findings.\n\nThe impact of incentives on the division of labor in science has also\nbeen analyzed in terms of incentives to \u201cexploit\u201d existing\nprojects in contrast to incentives to \u201cexplore\u201d novel\nideas. For instance, De Langhe (2014b) developed a generalized version\nof Kitcher and Strevens\u2019 model in which agents achieve the\noptimal division of labor by weighing up relative costs and benefits\nof exploiting available theories and exploring new ones. Within the\nframework of bandit models and network epistemology (see\n Section 3.2),\n Kummerfeld and Zollman (2016) proposed an ABM that examines a\nscenario in which scientists face two rival hypotheses, one of which\nis better though the agents don\u2019t know which one. While agents\nalways choose to pursue (or exploit) a hypothesis that seems more\npromising, they may also occasionally research (and thereby explore)\nthe alternative one. The simulations show that if the community is\nleft to be self-organized in the sense that each scientist explores to\nthe extent that they consider individually optimal, agents will be\nincentivized to leave exploration to others. As a result, scientists\nwill fail to develop a sufficiently high incentive for exploring novel\nideas, that is, an incentive which would be optimal from the\nperspective of their community at large.\n4.2 Theoretical diversity and the communication structure of science\n4.2.1 The \u201cZollman effect\u201d\n\nThe study of theoretical diversity in terms of network epistemology\nled to a novel hypothesis: that the communication structure of a\nscientific community can promote or hinder the emergence of\ntheoretical diversity and thereby impact the division of cognitive\nlabor. The idea was first demonstrated by bandit models developed by\nZollman (2007, 2010; see\n Section 3.2)\n and came to be known as the \u201cZollman effect\u201d (Rosenstock,\nBruner, & O\u2019Connor 2017). ABMs by Grim (2009) Grim, Singer,\nFisher, and colleagues (2013), and Angere & Olsson (2017) produced\nsimilar findings based on different modeling\n frameworks.[8]\n These models show that in highly connected communities early\nerroneous results may spread quickly among scientists, leading them to\ninvestigate a sub-optimal line of inquiry. As a result, scientists may\nprematurely abandon the exploration of different hypotheses, and\ninstead exploit the inferior ones. In light of these findings, Zollman\n(2010) emphasized that for an inquiry to be successful it needs a\nproperty of \u201ctransient diversity\u201d: a process in which a\ncommunity engages in a parallel exploration of different theories,\nwhich lasts sufficiently long to prevent a premature abandonment of\nthe best theory, but which eventually gets replaced by a consensus on\nit. Besides the result that connectivity can be harmful, it has also\nbeen shown that learning in less connected networks is slower, which\nindicates a trade-off between accuracy and speed in the context of\nsocial learning (Zollman 2007; Grim, Singer, Fisher, et al. 2013).\n\nSubsequent studies showed, however, that the Zollman effect is not\nvery robust within the parameter space of the original model\n(Rosenstock et al. 2017). In particular, the result holds for those\nparameters that can be considered characteristic of difficult inquiry:\nscenarios in which there is a relatively small number of scientists,\nthe evidence is gathered in relatively small batches, and the\ndifference between the objective success of the rival hypotheses is\nrelatively small. Moreover, additional models showed that if the\ndiversity (and hence, exploration) of pursued hypotheses is generated\nin some other way, more connected communities may outperform less\nconnected ones. For instance, Kummerfeld and Zollman (2016) showed\nthat relaxing the trade-off between exploration and exploitation by\nallowing agents to occasionally gain information about the hypothesis\nthey are not currently pursuing is a way to generate diversity,\nleading a fully connected community to perform better than less\nconnected ones. Another way of generating diversity was examined by\nFrey and \u0160e\u0161elja (2020): they show that if scientists\nhave a dose of caution or \u201crational inertia\u201d when deciding\nwhether to abandon their current theory and start pursuing the rival,\na fully connected community gets a sufficient degree of exploration to\noutperform less connected groups. Similar points have been made with\nABMs based on other modeling frameworks, such as the bounded\nconfidence model by Douven and Hegselmann (2022), or an\nargumentation-based ABM by Borg, Frey, \u0160e\u0161elja, and\nStra\u00dfer (2018), each of which shows a different way of\npreserving transient diversity in spite of a high degree of\nconnectivity. \n4.2.2 The spread of disinformation\n\nABMs studying epistemically pernicious strategies in scientific\ncommunities have largely employed network epistemology bandit models\n(see\n Section 3.2).\n For instance, a model by Holman and Bruner (2015) examines how an\ninterference of industry-sponsored agents may impact the information\nflow in the medical community, and which strategies scientists could\nemploy to protect themselves from such a pernicious influence. For\nthis purpose, they consider a scenario in which medical doctors\nregularly communicate with industry-sponsored agents about the\nefficacy of a certain pharmaceutical product as a treatment for a\ngiven disease. Since the industry-sponsored agents are motivated by\nfinancial rather than epistemic interests and they are unlikely to\nchange their minds no matter how much opposing evidence they receive,\nthey are not merely biased, but \u201cintransigently biased\u201d.\nTheir simulations indicate two ways in which a scientific community\ncan protect itself from the pernicious influence of the intransigently\nbiased agent: first, by increasing their connectivity, and second, by\nlearning how to reorganize their social network on the basis of\ntrustworthiness, which leads them to eventually ignore the biased\nagent. In a follow-up model, Holman and Bruner (2017) also show how\nthe industry can bias a scientific community without corrupting any of\nthe individual scientists that compose it, but by simply helping\nindustry-friendly scientists to have successful careers.\n\nUsing a similar network-epistemology approach, Weatherall,\nO\u2019Connor and Bruner (2020) developed a bandit model to study the\n\u201cTobacco strategy\u201d, employed by the tobacco industry in\nthe second half of the twentieth century to mislead the public about\nthe negative health effects of smoking (analyzed in detail by Oreskes\n& Conway 2010). In particular, the model examines how certain\ndeceptive practices can mislead public opinion without even\ninterfering with (epistemically driven) scientific research. The\nauthors look into two such propagandist strategies: a \u201cselective\nsharing\u201d of research results that fit the industry\u2019s\npreferred position, and a \u201cbiased production\u201d of research\nresults where additional research gets funded, but only suitable\nfindings get published. The results show that both strategies are\neffective in misleading policymakers about the scientific output under\nvarious examined parameters since in both cases the policymakers\nupdate their beliefs on the basis of a biased sample of results,\nskewed towards the worse theory. The authors also look into strategies\nemployed by journalists reporting on scientific findings and show that\nincautiously aiming to be \u201cfair\u201d by reporting an equal\nnumber of results from both sides of the controversy may result in the\nspread of misleading information.\n\nAnother example of ABMs developed to examine deception in science is\nan argumentation-based model by Borg, Frey, \u0160e\u0161elja, and\nStra\u00dfer (2017, 2018; see\n Section 3.1.3).\n Assuming the context of rival research programs where scientists have\nto identify the best out of three available ones, deceptive\ncommunication is represented in terms of agents sharing only positive\nfindings about their theory, while withholding news about potential\nanomalies. The underlying idea is that deception consists in providing\nsome (true) information while at the same time withholding other\ninformation, which leads the receiver to make a wrong inference\n(Caminada 2009). Unlike the previous two models discussed in this\nsection, where not all agents display biased or deceptive behavior,\nBorg et al. study network effects in a population consisting entirely\nof deceptive scientists. Such a scenario represents a community that\nis driven, for instance, by confirmation bias and an incentive to\nshield one\u2019s research line from critical scrutiny. The\nsimulations show that, first, reliable communities (consisting of no\ndeceivers) are significantly more successful than the deceptive ones,\nand second, increasing the connectivity makes it more likely that\ndeceptive populations converge on the best theory.\n4.3 Cognitive diversity\n\nAs we have seen in\n Section 2.1,\n the problem of cognitive diversity concerns the relation between the\ndiversity of cognitive features of scientists (including their\nbackground beliefs, reasoning styles, research preferences, heuristics\nand strategies) and the inquiry of the scientific community.\nPhilosophers of science have especially been interested in how the\ndivision of labor across different research heuristics impacts the\nperformance of the community.\n\nA particularly influential ABM tackling this issue is the epistemic\nlandscape model by Weisberg and Muldoon (2009). The model examines the\ndivision of labor catalyzed by different research strategies, where\nscientists can act as the \u201ccontrols\u201d,\n\u201cfollowers\u201d or \u201cmavericks\u201d (see above\n Section 3.1).\n In view of the simulations, Weisberg and Muldoon argue that, first,\nmavericks outperform other research strategies. Second, if we consider\nthe maverick strategy to be costly in terms of the necessary\nresources, then introducing mavericks to populations of followers can\nlead to an optimal division of labor. While Weisberg and\nMuldoon\u2019s ABM eventually turned out to include a coding error\n(Alexander et al. 2015), their claim that cognitive diversity improves\nthe productivity of scientists received support from adjusted versions\nof the model, albeit with some qualifications.\n\nFirst, Thoma\u2019s (2015) model showed that cognitively diverse\ngroups outperform homogeneous ones if scientists are sufficiently\nflexible to change their current approach and sufficiently informed\nabout the research conducted by others in the community. Second,\nP\u00f6yh\u00f6nen (2017) confirmed that if we consider the maverick\nstrategy to be slightly more time-consuming, mixed populations of\nmavericks and followers may outperform communities consisting only of\nmavericks in terms of the average epistemic significance of the\nobtained results. According to P\u00f6yh\u00f6nen, another condition\nthat needs to be satisfied if cognitive diversity is to be beneficial\nconcerns the topology of the landscape: diverse populations outperform\nhomogeneous ones only in case of more challenging inquiries\n(represented in terms of rugged epistemic landscapes), but not in case\nof easy research problems (represented by landscapes such as Weisberg\nand Muldoon\u2019s one,\n Figure 2).\n The importance of the topology of the landscape was also emphasized\nby Alexander and colleagues (2015) who use NK-landscapes to show that\nwhether social learning is beneficial or not crucially depends on the\nlandscape\u2019s topology. Finally, there are other research\nstrategies (such as Alexander and colleagues\u2019\n\u201cswarm\u201d one, see\n Section 3.1.1)\n that outperform Weisberg and Muldoon\u2019s mavericks, while small\nchanges in the follower strategy may significantly improve its\nperformance (Fern\u00e1ndez Pinto & Fern\u00e1ndez Pinto\n2018).\n\nAnother aspect of cognitive diversity that received attention in the\nmodeling literature concerns the relationship between diversity and\nexpertise. This issue was first studied in economics by Hong and Page\n(2004). The model examined how heuristically diverse groups,\nconsisting of agents with diverse problem-solving approaches, compare\nwith groups consisting solely of experts with respect to finding a\nsolution to a particular problem. Hong and Page\u2019s original\nresult suggested that \u201cdiversity trumps ability\u201d in the\nsense that groups consisting of individuals employing diverse\nheuristic approaches outperfom groups consisting solely of experts,\nthat is, agents who are the best \u201cproblem-solvers\u201d. While\nthis finding became quite influential, subsequent studies showed that\nit does not hold robustly once more realistic assumptions about\nexpertise are added to the model (Grim, Singer, Bramson, et al. 2019;\nReijula & Kuorikoski 2021; see also Singer 2019).\n\nThe problem of cognitive diversity and the division of labor in\nscientific communities was also studied by Hegselmann and\nKrause\u2019s bounded-confidence model (Hegselmann & Krause 2006;\nsee above\n Section 3.3).\n The ABM examines opinion dynamics in a community that is diverse in\nthe sense that only some individuals are active truth seekers, while\nothers adjust their beliefs by exchanging opinions with those agents\nwho have sufficiently similar beliefs to their own. Hegselmann and\nKrause investigate conditions under which such a community can reach\nconsensus on the truth, combining agent-based modeling and analytical\nmethods. They show that, on the one hand, if all agents in the model\nare truth seekers, they achieve a consensus on the truth. On the other\nhand, if the community divides labor, its ability to reach a consensus\non the truth will depend on the number of truth seeking agents, the\nposition of the truth relative to the agents\u2019 opinions, the\ndegree of confidence determining the scope of opinion exchange and the\nrelative weight of the truth signal (in contrast to the weight of\nsocial information). For instance, under certain parameter settings\neven a single truth-seeking agent will lead the rest of the community\nto the truth.\n4.4 Social diversity\n\nAs we have seen in\n Section 2.4,\n ABMs were introduced to study two issues that concern social\ndiversity in the context of science: first, epistemic effects of\nsocially diverse scientific groups, and second, factors that can\nundermine social diversity or disadvantage members of minorities in\nscience.\n\nConcerning the former question, Fazelpour and Steel (2022) developed a\nnetwork epistemology bandit model (see\n Section 3.2)\n to study effects of social (or demographic) diversity on collective\ninquiry. The model examines how different degrees of trust between\nsocially distinct sub-groups impact the performance of the scientific\ncommunity. The simulations show that social diversity can improve\ngroup inquiry by reducing the excessive trust scientists may place in\neach other\u2019s findings. This is particularly relevant in cases of\ndifficult inquiry in tightly connected communities, where a high\ndegree of trust may lead to a premature endorsement of an objectively\nfalse hypothesis. The authors also demonstrate how social diversity\ncan counteract negative effects of conformity in the choice of\nresearch paths, under the condition that the tendency to conform\nisn\u2019t too high. Using a similar bandit framework, Wu (2023)\nexamines how a marginalized group learns in environments in which\nmembers of the dominant group ignore or devalue results coming from\nthe former. She shows that in such situations, members of the\nmarginalized group can achieve an epistemic advantage in the sense of\nforming more accurate beliefs than the members of the dominant group.\nIn this way, the model aims to explain the \u201cinversion\nthesis\u201d from standpoint epistemology, according to which\nmarginalized groups may have an epistemically privileged status (Wylie\n2003).\n\nWith regard to the latter question, we previously mentioned the model\nby Rubin and Schneider (2021), which shows how minority members can\nbecome disadvantaged due to the priority rule in science and the\nstructure of the scientific community\n (Section 4.1).\n In a follow-up model, Rubin (2022) demonstrates how the\norganizational structure of the scientific community can also\ninfluence the emergence of \u201ccitation gaps\u201d, where\npublications by members of underrepresented and minority groups are\ncited less than those by members of the majority. The impact of one\u2019s\nminority status on one\u2019s position in scientific collaborations was\nmainly studied by means of evolutionary game-theoretic models of\nbargaining (see\n Section 3.4).\n The models show different ways in which minorities can become\ndiscriminated against merely due to their minority status and the\nimpact of such a status on the bargaining and collaborative practices\n(Rubin & O\u2019Connor 2018; O\u2019Connor & Bruner 2019;\nVentura 2023). Moreover, the results show that such an outcome may\nhave a negative impact on scientific progress, and it may help to\nexplain why gender and racial minorities tend to cluster in academic\nsubdisciplines (O\u2019Connor & Bruner 2019; Rubin &\nO\u2019Connor 2018). We will revisit these models below in\n Section 4.7,\n devoted to the issue of scientific collaboration.\n4.5 Peer-disagreement in science\n\nAs we have seen in\n Section 2.5,\n peer disagreement debate highlighted different norms that can guide\nscientists. ABMs were introduced to examine the impact of these norms\non the communal inquiry. To this end, Douven (2010) and De Langhe\n(2013) enhanced the bounded confidence model by Hegselmann and Krause\n(2006; see\n Section 3.3)\n to study the impact of the Conciliatory and Steadfast Norms on the\ngoals of\n inquiry.[9]\n\n\nBoth models suggest that the impact of these norms is context\ndependent. In Douven\u2019s model, when data received through inquiry\nis not very noisy\u2014in the sense that it is indicative of the\ntruth rather than resulting from measurement errors\u2014conciliating\npopulations will be faster in discovering the truth than the steadfast\nones. Nevertheless, if the data becomes noisy, the simulations show a\ntrade-off between accuracy and speed. While steadfast populations get\nwithin a moderate distance of the truth relatively quickly, they\ndon\u2019t improve their accuracy in the subsequent rounds of the\nsimulation. In contrast, conciliating populations end up closer to the\ntruth but it takes them relatively longer to do so. This indicates\nthat whether a norm is optimal for the communal goals may largely\ndepend on contextual issues of inquiry, such as obtaining noise-free\nevidence. De Langhe comes to a similar conclusion, using a model that\nrepresents longstanding scientific disagreements and an inquiry\ninvolving multiple rivaling epistemic systems. The model is inspired\nby Goldman\u2019s (2010) idea that even though disagreeing peers may\nshare the evidence concerning the issue in question, they may not\nshare the evidence for the epistemic system within which they evaluate\nthe former kind of evidence. His simulations suggest that while\nconciliating within one\u2019s epistemic system is beneficial, that\nis not the case when it comes to disagreements between different\nepistemic\n systems.[10]\n\n4.6 Scientific polarization\n\nThe initial work on ABMs of polarization in scientific communities is\nbased on Hegselmann and Krause\u2019s bounded confidence model\n(Hegselmann & Krause 2006; see\n Section 3.3).[11]\n The model shows that a community can polarize when some agents form\ntheir opinions by disregarding the evidence coming from the world and\nby instead taking into account only what they learn from others, who\nhave sufficiently similar views. Subsequent models, based on different\nframeworks, sought to examine whether polarization can emerge even if\nall agents are truth-seekers, that is, rational agents who form their\nopinions only in view of epistemic considerations.\n\nFor example, a model by Singer et al. (2019) shows the emergence of\npolarization in groups of deliberating agents who share reasons for\ntheir beliefs, and who merely use a coherence-based approach to manage\ntheir limited memory (by forgetting those reasons that conflict with\nthe view supported by most of their previous considerations). Using\nthe Bayesian modeling framework Laputa, Olsson (2013) shows how\npolarization can emerge over the course of deliberation if agents\nassign different degrees of trust to the testimony of others,\ndepending on how similar views they hold. In another Bayesian\nframework based on bandit models, O\u2019Connor and Weatherall (2018)\nshow how a community of scientists who share not only their testimony,\nbut unbiased evidence, can end up in a polarized state if they treat\nevidence obtained by other scientists, whose beliefs are too far off\nfrom their own, as uncertain. Moreover, Michelini, Osorio and\ncolleagues (forthcoming) combine bandit models with the\nbounded-confidence framework to study polarization in communities that\ndisagree on the diagnostic value of evidence for a certain hypothesis\n(modeled by the Bayes factor). Their results indicate that an initial\ndisagreement on the diagnosticity of evidence can lead to\npolarization, depending on the sample size of the performed studies\nand the confidence interval within which scientists share their\nopinions.\n\nPolarization in epistemic communities has also been studied by ABMs\nsimulating argumentative dynamics. For example, using the framework by\nBetz (2013), Kopecky (2022) proposes a model that shows how certain\nways in which rational agents engage in argumentative exchange in an\nopen debate forum can result in polarized communities, even if agents\ndon\u2019t have a preference for whom they argue with.\n4.7 Scientific collaboration\n\nAs discussed in\n Section 2.7,\n ABMs have been used to study when collaborating is beneficial and how\nit impacts inquiry. To examine why collaborations emerge and when they\nare beneficial, Boyer-Kassem and Imbert (2015) developed a\ncomputational model in which scientists collaborate by sharing\nintermediate results. They study collaborative groups in a larger\ncompetitive community, driven by the priority rule, where\ncollaborators have to equally share the reward for making a discovery.\nTheir simulations suggest that collaborating is beneficial both for\ncommunal and individual inquiry. When scientists collaborate, they\nproceed faster with their inquiry, making it more likely that they\nwill belong to a team that is first to make a discovery. Moreover,\nwhile the scientific community may profit from all scientists fully\ncollaborating (since solutions found by some scientists will be shared\nwith everyone), for individual scientists other collaborative\nconstellations may be better (see also Boyer-Kassem & Imbert\nforthcoming). \n\nTo examine conditions for optimal collaboration Zollman (2017)\nproposed a network-epistemology model. The model starts from the\nassumption that by collaborating scientists teach each other different\nconceptual schemes aimed at solving scientific problems, and that\ncollaboration comes at a cost. His findings suggest that reducing the\ncosts of collaborations and enlarging the size of the collaborative\ngroup benefits those involved, though encouraging scientists to engage\nwith different collaborative groups may not lead to efficient\ninquiry.\n\nWhile the above models studies socially uniform communities, ABMs have\nalso been employed to study socially diverse collaborative\nenvironments and discriminatory patterns that can endogenously emerge\nin them. These models are typically based on evolutionary\ngame-theoretic frameworks examining bargaining norms that accompany\nacademic collaborations (see\n Section 3.4).\n Bruner (2019) initially used this framework to show that in cultural\ninteractions involving a division of resources, minority members can\nbecome disadvantaged merely due to the smaller size of their\n group.[12]\n O\u2019Connor and Bruner (2019) use this approach to study the\nemergence of similar patterns in epistemic communities. The\nsimulations show that minorities can become disadvantaged in\nscientific collaborations due to the size of their group, where the\neffect is increased the smaller their group is. Rubin and\nO\u2019Connor (2018) use a similar framework to examine diversity and\ndiscrimination in epistemic collaboration networks, with a special\nfocus on the role of homophily\u2014the tendency to preferentially\nestablish links with members of one\u2019s own social group in\ncontrast to members of the outgroup. Their results suggest that\ndiscriminatory norms, likely to emerge in academic interaction, may\npromote homophily and decrease social diversity in collaborative\nnetworks. Furthermore, Ventura (2023) shows how inequality can emerge\nin collaboration networks even in the absence of demographic\ncategories since scientists can become disadvantaged merely due to the\nstructure of the collaboration network and their specific position in\nit.\n4.8 Additional themes\n\nAs mentioned in\n Section 2.8,\n ABMs have been applied to the study of many additional themes in\nphilosophy of science: the problem of allocating funding to research\ngrants (Harnagel 2019; Avin 2019a,b), examining Popperian and Kuhnian\nmodels of scientific progress (De Langhe 2014a), the dynamics of\nnormal and revolutionary science (De Langhe 2017), pluralism of\nscientific methods (Currie & Avin 2019), the impact of methods\nguiding research design and data analysis on the quality of scientific\nfindings (Smaldino & McElreath 2016), strategic behavior of\nscientists as a motivated exchange of beliefs (Merdes 2021),\njournals\u2019 publishing strategies (Zollman 2009), meta-inductive\nlearning (Schurz 2009, 2012), the impact of evidential strength on the\naccuracy of scientific consensus (Santana 2018), the management and\nstructure of scientific groups (Sikimi\u0107 & Herud-Sikimi\u0107\n2022), the reliability of testimonial norms, which guide how one\nshould change beliefs in light of others\u2019 claims (Mayo-Wilson\n2014), the assessment of source reliability (Merdes, Von Sydow, &\nHahn 2021), the impact of \u201cepistemic stubbornness\u201d as an\nunwillingness to change one\u2019s scientific stance in face of\ncountervailing evidence (Santana 2021), the impact of different\ntheory-choice evaluations on the efficiency of inquiry (Borg et al.\n2019), and so forth.\n5. Epistemology of Agent-Based Modeling\n\nIn the previous section we delved into various results obtained by\nmeans of agent-based modeling. But how seriously should we take each\nof these findings? What exactly do they tell us about science? Given\nthat one of the main cognitive functions of models in science is to\nhelp us to learn about the world (cf. the entry on\n models in science),\n this raises the question: what exactly can we learn with ABMs, and\nwhich methodological steps do we have to follow to acquire such\nknowledge? These issues are a matter of the epistemology of\nagent-based\n modeling.[13]\n\n5.1 The challenge of abstract modeling\n\nIn an early discussion on simulations in social sciences, Boero and\nSquazzoni (2005) proposed a classification of ABMs into case-based\nmodels, typifications, and theoretical abstractions\u2014based on the\nproperties of the represented target. While a case-based model\nrepresents an empirical scenario that is delineated in time and space,\ntypifications represent classes of empirical phenomena. Finally,\ntheoretical abstractions, as their name suggests, abstract away from\nvarious features of empirical targets and aim at simplified and\ngeneral representation of social phenomena.\n\nFollowing the tradition of abstract ABMs in social sciences, the\nmajority of simulations in philosophy of science have been developed\nwithin the so-called \u201cKISS\u201d (Keep it Simple,\nStupid)\n approach.[14]\n As such, they belong to the third type of ABMs listed above. The main\nadvantage of constructing simple models is that they allow for an\neasier understanding of the represented causal mechanisms than complex\nmodels do. However, this also raises the question: what can we learn\nfrom these models about real science, given their highly idealized\ncharacter? For instance, do results of such simulations increase our\nunderstanding of scientific communities? Can we use them to provide\npotential explanations of certain episodes from the history of\nscience, or to formulate normative recommendations for how scientific\ninquiry should be organized? These questions have been a matter of\nphilosophical debate, closely related to the discussion on the\nepistemic function of highly idealized or toy-models across empirical\n sciences.[15]\n In particular, critics have argued that if abstract ABMs are to be\ninformative of empirical targets, they first need to be verified and\nempirically validated.\n5.2 Verification and validation: from exploratory to explanatory functions of ABMs\n\nIn the context of agent-based modeling, verification is a method of\nevaluating the accuracy of the computer program underlying an ABM\nrelative to its conceptual design. Validation, on the other hand,\nconcerns the evaluation of the link between the model and its\npurported target. Irrespective of the purpose for which the model was\nbuilt, it always requires some degree of verification to ensure that\nits simulation code does not suffer from bugs and other unintended\nissues. The type of required validation depends on the purpose of the\nmodel and its intended target. As Mayo-Wilson and Zollman (2021) have\nargued, validation isn\u2019t always necessary for some modeling\npurposes, such as illustrating that certain events or situations are\ntheoretically possible. Models can instead be justified by\n\u201cplausibility arguments\u201d and in view of stylized\nhistorical case studies. According to Mayo-Wilson and Zollman, ABMs\nplay a role analogous to thought experiments in that they can be used\nto evoke normative intuitions, to justify counterfactual claims, to\nillustrate possibilities and impossibilities, and so on. Moreover,\nwhen it comes to questions concerning the dynamics of social systems,\nthey are more apt for the task than mere thought experiments due to\nthe complexity of such target phenomena.\n\nEmpirical validation is also not required if the function of an ABM is\nto provide a proof-of-concept or a how-possibly explanation. A model\nprovides a proof-of-concept (sometimes also called a\n\u201cproof-of-possibility\u201d or\n\u201cproof-of-principle\u201d) if it merely demonstrates a\ntheoretical possibility of a certain phenomenon (cf. Arnold 2008). The\ntarget phenomenon may be represented in an abstract, idealized way,\ndisregarding the empirical adequacy of the modeling assumptions.\nGelfert (2016: 85\u201386) distinguishes two specific functions of\nthe proof-of-concept modeling. First, a model may exemplify how an\napproach or methodology can generate a potential representation of a\ngiven target phenomenon. For instance, if an ABM shows how the\nframework of epistemic landscapes can be used to represent cognitive\ndiversity, it provides a proof-of-concept in this sense of the term.\nSecond, a model may provide results showing that a certain causal\nmechanism can be found within the model-world. For instance, if a\nhighly idealized simulation shows that a certain kind of cognitive\ndiversity results in efficient inquiry of the modeled community, it\nprovides a proof-of-concept in the latter sense. While\nproof-of-concept modeling is sometimes taken to be just a preliminary\nstep in the development of more realistic models (see for instance\nGr\u00e4bner 2018), it has also been considered as providing valuable\nphilosophical insights already on its own (see for example\n\u0160e\u0161elja 2021a).\n\nSimilarly, simulations provide how-possibly explanations\n(HPEs) if they show how a certain target phenomenon can possibly\nresult from certain preconditions (Rosenstock et al. 2017;\nGr\u00e4bner 2018; Frey & \u0160e\u0161elja 2018;\n\u0160e\u0161elja 2022b). In contrast to how-actually\nexplanations, or explanations simpliciter, which are accounts of how\nphenomena actually occur, HPEs (sometimes also called \u201cpotential\nexplanations\u201d) cover accounts of possible ways in which\nphenomena can\n occur.[16]\n According to a broad reading of the notion proposed by\nVerreault-Julien (2019), HPEs are propositions that have the form\n\u201cIt is possible that \u2018p because q\u2019.\u201d, where\np is the explanandum, q the explanans, and the\npossibility may refer to various types of modalities such as\nepistemic, logical, causal, and so forth.\n\nThe above epistemic functions\u2014providing a proof-of-concept or an\nHPE\u2014are often considered a kind of exploratory modeling, where\nthe represented target can be an abstract, theoretical phenomenon\n(Ylikoski & Aydinonat 2014; \u0160e\u0161elja 2021a). In\ncontrast, to provide explanations of empirical phenomena, many have\nargued that ABMs need to be empirically validated. This has been\nemphasized as important in case models are supposed to explain certain\npatterns from actual scientific practice, to provide evidence\nsupporting existing empirical (including historical) hypotheses, or to\nprovide suggestions for interventions through science policy (Arnold\n2014; Martini & Fern\u00e1ndez Pinto 2017; Thicke 2020;\n\u0160e\u0161elja 2021a).\n\nValidation of ABMs consists in examining whether the model is a\nreasonable representation of the target, where\n\u201creasonable\u201d may refer to different aspects of the model\n(Gr\u00e4bner 2018). For instance, we may test how well mechanisms\nrepresented in the model conform to our empirical knowledge about\nthem, whether the exogenous inputs for the model are empirically\nplausible, to what extent the output of the model replicates existing\nknowledge about the target, or whether it can predict its future\nstates. Different authors have suggested different elaborations of\nthese points with respect to ABMs in philosophy of science (see Thicke\n2020; \u0160e\u0161elja 2022b; Bedessem 2019; Politi 2021; Pesonen\n2022).\n\nWhile some of these steps may be challenging, others may be more\nfeasible. For instance Martini and Fern\u00e1ndez Pinto (2017) argue\nthat ABMs of science can be calibrated on empirical data. Harnagel\n(2019) exemplifies how this could be done by calibrating an epistemic\nlandscape model with bibliometric data.\n\nOthers have argued that results of simulations should at least be\nanalyzed in terms of their robustness. Robustness analysis\n(RA) includes: \n\n parameter RA, examining the stability of results with respect to\nchanges in parameter values of the model, usually studied by means of\nsensitivity\n analysis;[17]\n\n structural RA, which focuses on the stability of results under\nchanges in structural features of the model and its underlying\nassumptions; \n representational RA, which studies the stability of the results\nwith respect to changes in the representational framework, modelling\ntechnique, or modelling medium (Weisberg 2013: Chapter 9; Houkes,\n\u0160e\u0161elja, & Vaesen forthcoming).\n\n\nThe main purpose of RA in the context of ABMs is to help with\nunderstanding conditions (in the model world) under which results of\nthe model hold: whether they depend on specific parameter values or on\nspecific assumptions about the causal factors involved in the\nrepresented target, or whether the result is just an artifact of\ncertain idealizing assumptions in the model. This can benefit our\nunderstanding of the model and its results in at least two ways. On\nthe one hand, if an RA shows that the result holds under various\nchanges in parameter values, structural and representational\nassumptions, this may increase our confidence that the result is not a\nmere artifact of idealizations in the model (see, e.g., Kuorikoski,\nLehtinen, & Marchionni\n 2012).[18]\n On the other hand, if the result holds only for specific parameter\nvalues or under specific structural or representational assumptions,\nthis can help to delineate the context of application of the model\n(for example, the context of difficult inquiry, the context of inquiry\ninvolving a small scientific community, and so on).\n5.3 The \u201cfamily of models perspective\u201d\n\nThe importance of robustness analysis suggests that determining the\nepistemic function of a single ABM in isolation may be difficult. In\norder to assess whether the results of an ABM are explanatory of a\ncertain empirical target, it is useful to check whether they are\nrobust under changes in the idealizing modeling assumptions. One way\nto do so is to construct a new model by replacing some assumptions in\nthe previous one. Moreover, using a model based on an entirely\ndifferent representational framework may additionally help in such\nrobustness studies. This is why the value of using multiple models to\nstudy the same research question has been increasingly emphasized in\nthe modeling literature.\n\nFor instance, Aydinonat, Reijula, and Ylikoski (2021) have argued for\nthe importance of the \u201cfamily-of-models perspective\u201d. The\nauthors consider models as argumentative devices, where an argument\nsupported by a given model can be strengthened by means of analyses\nbased on subsequent models. The approach according to which phenomena\nshould be studied by means of multiple models has also been endorsed\nin the broader context of modeling in social sciences (cf. Page 2018;\nKuhlmann 2021).\n\nIn sum, even though ABMs in philosophy of science tend to be highly\nidealized, they can have exploratory roles, such as identifying\npossible causal mechanisms underlying scientific inquiry, offering\nhow-possibly explanations, or providing conjectures and novel\nperspectives on historical case-studies (cf. \u0160e\u0161elja\n2022a). In addition, they can play more challenging epistemic roles\n(such as providing explanations of empirical phenomena or evidence for\nempirical hypotheses) if accompanied by validation procedures, which\nmay benefit from looking into classes of models aimed at the same\ntarget phenomenon.\n6. Conclusion and Outlook\n\nThis entry has provided an overview of applications of agent-based\nmodeling to issues studied by philosophers of science. Since such\napplications are primarily concerned with social aspects of scientific\ninquiry, ABMs in philosophy of science are mainly developed within the\nsubfield of formal social epistemology of science. While agent-based\nmodeling has experienced rapid growth in this domain, it remains to\nstand the test of time. In particular, foundational issues concerning\nthe epistemic status of abstract models and their methodological\nunderpinnings (for instance, the KISS vs. the KIDS approach, see\n footnote 14)\n remain open. Having said that, theoretical achievements made with the\nexisting models have been remarkable and they provide a firm ground\nfor further growth of agent-based modeling as a philosophical\nmethod.\n\nOne avenue that has received relatively little attention is the\ncombination of agent-based modeling and empirical methods. Although\nearly philosophical discussions on ABMs emphasized the fruitful\ncombination of experimental and computational methods (see, e.g.,\nHartmann, Lisciandra, & Machery 2013), this area has not been\nexplored extensively, leaving ample opportunities for future research.\nFor instance, highly idealized ABMs can benefit from validation in\nterms of experimental studies (as exemplified by Mohseni et al. 2021).\nMoreover, qualitative research, such as ethnographic studies of\nscientific communities, can help to empirically inform assumptions\nused to build models (see, e.g., Ghorbani, Dijkema, & Schrauwen\n2015).\n\nAnother emerging line of inquiry comes from the recent developments in\nartificial intelligence. In particular, big data and machine-learning\nmodels can be a fruitful way of generating input for ABMs, such as the\nbehavior of agents (see, e.g., Kavak, Padilla, Lynch, & Diallo\n2018; Zhang, Valencia, & Chang 2023). For instance, natural\nlanguage processing technology has been used to represent agents who\nexpress their arguments in terms of natural language (Betz 2022). Such\nenhancements provide novel opportunities for highly idealized models:\nfrom their robustness analyses in which certain assumptions are\nde-idealized to the exploration of novel questions and phenomena.",
