    "main_text": "The Morality and Rationality of Suicide || The Deontological Argument from the Sanctity of Life\n3.2 The Deontological Argument from the Sanctity of Life\n\nThe simplest moral outlook on suicide holds that it is necessarily\nwrong because human life is sacred. Though this position is often\nassociated with religious thinkers, especially Catholics, Ronald\nDworkin (1993) points out that atheists may appeal to this claim as\nwell. According to this \u2018sanctity of life\u2019 view, human\nlife is inherently valuable and precious, demanding respect from\nothers and reverence for oneself. Hence, suicide is wrong because it\nviolates our moral duty to honor the inherent value of human life,\nregardless of the value of that life to others or to the person whose\nlife it is. The sanctity of life view is thus a deontological position\non suicide.\n\nThe great merit of the sanctity of life position is that it reflects a\ncommon moral sentiment, namely, that killing is wrong in itself. But\nthe sanctity of life view faces several challenges. The first is that\nits proponents need to show that it is consistent with the\njustifiability of other forms of killing many have thought defensible,\nsuch as killing in wartime or killing in self-defense. Why, in other\nwords, are other forms of killing morally permitted but suicide is\nnot? Second, the sanctity of life view appears to assert that simply\nbeing alive, irrespective of the current or expected quality of a\nperson\u2019s life, confers value on a human life. But Peter Singer\n(1994) and others have argued against the sanctity of life position on\nthe grounds that the value of a continuing life is not intrinsic but\nextrinsic, to be judged on the basis of the individual\u2019s likely\nfuture quality of life. If the value of a person\u2019s continued\nlife is measured by its likely quality, then suicide may be\npermissible when that quality is low (see\n section 3.5).\n Third, we may question the inference from the sanctity of life to the\nmoral impermissibility of suicide. Those who engage in suicidal\nbehavior when their futures promise to be extraordinarily bleak do not\nseem to exhibit insufficient regard for the sanctity of life (Dworkin\n1993, 238). Indeed, it may be argued that suicide may affirm the value\nof human lives in those circumstances where medical or psychological\nconditions reduce individuals to shadows of their former fully capable\nselves (Cholbi 2002).\n",
