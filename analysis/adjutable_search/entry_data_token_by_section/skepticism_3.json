    "main_text": "The Argument for Cartesian Skepticism Employing the Closure Principle || Consideration of CP1\n3.1 Consideration of CP1\n\nLet us begin an examination of CP1 and the general closure principle,\nCP, of which CP1 is an instantiation. Closure certainly does hold for\nsome properties, for example, truth. If p is true and implies\nq, then q is true. It just as clearly does not hold for\nother properties, for example being surprising. It might be surprising\nthat Tom\u00e1s is taller than his father, but it is certainly not\nsurprising that Tom\u00e1s is taller than someone, and yet the\nformer entails the latter. What about justified belief? Does Closure\nhold for it?\n\nIt might be thought that the answer must be a clear \u201cNo\u201d,\nfor the following reasons. First, notice that every logical truth is\nentailed by every proposition. If Closure held for justification, then\nwe would have to say that everybody is justified in believing every\nlogical truth (provided that we are willing to grant that everybody is\njustified in believing at least one proposition). But this\ndoesn\u2019t seem plausible. Some logical truths are too complicated\nto even parse, let alone be justified in believing. If this is true,\nthen Closure doesn\u2019t hold for belief (that is to say, we may\nfail to believe propositions entailed by propositions we already\nbelieve). The existence of very complicated logical truths also\nunderlies another worry for Closure. For to every logical entailment\nbetween propositions there corresponds a logical truth: the (material)\nconditional with the entailing proposition in the antecedent and the\nentailed proposition in the consequent. Some of these logically true\nconditionals will be examples of propositions that we are not\njustified in believing (if only because the consequent is too\ncomplicated for beings like us to even parse). In that case, we might\nwell be justified in believing their antecedents without being\njustified in believing their consequents.\n\nBut it also appears that CP can easily be repaired. We can stipulate\n(i) that the domain of the propositions in the generalization of CP\nincludes only contingent propositions that are within S\u2019s\ncapacity to grasp and (ii) that the entailment is\n\u201cobvious\u201d to S. The skeptic can agree to those\nrestrictions because the skeptical scenarios are posited in such a way\nas to render it obvious that our ordinary beliefs are false in those\nscenarios, and it is taken to be a contingent claim that S is\nin the actual circumstances as described in the antecedent. (For a\nfull discussion of the required repairs of CP, see David &\nWarfield 2008 and Hawthorne 2014.)\n\nThere is one other important, required clarification of the restricted\nversion of CP. \u201cJustified belief\u201d is ambiguous. It could\nbe used to refer to a species of actually held beliefs\u2014namely,\nthose actually held beliefs of S that are justified. Or it\ncould refer to propositions that S is justified in\nbelieving\u2014regardless of whether S does indeed believe\nthem. Following Roderick Firth, the distinction between actually held\njustified beliefs and propositions one is justified in believing,\nregardless of whether they are actually believed, is often marked by\ndistinguishing between doxastic and propositional justification (see\nFirth 1978). If CP is to be acceptable, \u201cjustified in\nbelieving\u201d in the consequent must be used so as to refer to\npropositional justification for a reason already cited, i.e., that\nClosure does not hold for belief. In other words, one of\nS\u2019s actual beliefs, p, might be justified and\nS still fail to believe some proposition that is entailed by\n p.[6]\n\nWe are now in a position to ask: Does the restricted form of closure\nhold? There are at least three types of argument against closure in\nthe literature: alleged counterexamples, alleged unpalatable\nconsequences, and incompatibility with allegedly plausible\nepistemological theories. In the remainder of this section we examine\none exemplar of each of these.\n\nFred Dretske and others have produced cases in which they believe CP\n fails.[7]\n Dretske writes:\n\n\n\u2026something\u2019s being a zebra implies that it is not a\nmule\u2026cleverly disguised by the zoo authorities to look like a\nzebra. Do you know that these animals are not mules cleverly\ndisguised? If you are tempted to say \u201cYes\u201d to this\nquestion, think a moment about what reasons you have, what evidence\nyou can produce in favor of this claim. The evidence you had\nfor thinking them zebras has been effectively neutralized, since it\ndoes not count toward their not being mules cleverly\ndisguised to look like zebras. (Dretske 1970: 1015\u20131016)\n\n\nDretske is speaking of knowledge rather than justified beliefs, but\nthat seems irrelevant since the issue concerns the supposed lack of a\nsufficient source of evidence or reasons for the claim that the animal\nis not a cleverly disguised mule.\n\nThe crucial thing to note about this proposed counterexample is that\nit works only if the Closure Principle entails that the very same\nsource of evidence that justifies S in believing that the\nanimals are zebras must justify S in believing that they are\nnot cleverly disguised mules. Since the evidence for the former has\nbeen \u201ceffectively neutralized\u201d, it is not available for\nthe latter. Now, in response one could claim that once the question of\nwhether the animals are disguised mules has been raised, the evidence\nis \u201ceffectively neutralized\u201d for both the former and the\nlatter, and S is no longer justified in believing that the\nanimals are zebras. Thus, it could be held that this example could\nactually be used to support CP. Nevertheless, let us grant that the\nevidence for the claim that the animals are zebras cannot be used to\nshow that they are not cleverly disguised mules. Still, it could be\nargued that this would not force giving up CP.\n\nSuch an argument could begin by recalling that CP claimed merely that\nwhenever a subject is justified in believing p, then that\nsubject is justified in believing q. CP does not require that\nthe subject have the same evidence for p as she does for\nq. Dretske\u2019s purported counterexample seems to require\nthat CP implies that the adequate source of evidence is the same for\nboth propositions.\n\nNo doubt this constraint sometimes correctly portrays the relevant\nevidential relationships when some proposition entails some other\nproposition. For example, suppose I have adequate evidence for the\nclaim that Anne has two brothers. Then it would seem that the very\nsame evidence would be adequate for believing that Anne has at least\none brother. But the defender of CP, and more particularly the\nCartesian Skeptic, could point out that closure does not require this\nto hold for every case.\n\nThere are two other possibilities. First, one may hold that when\np entails q and there is some evidence e for\np, it is p itself that is evidence for q. For\nexample, it may be held that given that I have adequate evidence for\nbelieving that 2 is a prime number, I can use that very proposition\n(that 2 is a prime number) as an adequate reason for believing that\nthere is at least one even prime. (See Klein 1981, 1995, and 2000, but\nsee below for reasons for doubting that this is a genuine\npossibility.) Second, there are cases where the order is reversed\nbecause q serves as part of the evidence for p. For\nexample, suppose that I am justified, ceteris paribus, in\nbelieving that (pure) water is present if I am justified in believing\nthat there is present, at standard temperature and pressure, a clear,\nodorless, watery-tasting and watery-looking fluid that contains\nhydrogen and oxygen. This pattern is typical of abductive inferences,\nand is often referred to as \u201cinference to the best\nexplanation\u201d. (See Vogel 1990, 2014b for a discussion of Cartesian Skepticism and inference to\nthe best explanation.) In addition, there are cases in which it seems\nthat some contraries of h need to be eliminated prior to\nh\u2019s being justified. For example, reconsidering the\nzebra-in-the-zoo case, it seems to be true that if I had some good\nreason to think that the animals are cleverly disguised mules, such a\ncontrary would need to be eliminated before I would be justified in\nbelieving that the animals were\n zebras.[8]\n\nIt could also be argued that CP has unacceptable consequences. Of\ncourse, one of those unacceptable consequences may well be Cartesian\nSkepticism itself, but to point that out in the present context would\nbe dialectically unhelpful. It has been argued, however, that CP by\nitself has far-reaching skeptical consequences. Notice that the\nargument for Cartesian Skepticism under consideration contains CP2 as\nan essential premise. The present concern is that CP by itself (and\ntherefore CP1, if justified on the basis of CP), without help from\nCP2, has skeptical consequences. If that were true, that would be a\nreason to be wary of CP, for it would be a much stronger principle\nthan advertised.\n\nThe argument can be presented as a conflict between CP, on the one\nhand, and three other principles. Those three other principles are,\nallegedly, beyond reproach, and so CP is to be blamed for the\nconflict. The first principle in question may be thought of as\nenshrining the possibility of knowledge (and justification) by\nampliative inference:\n\n\nAmpliativity: It is possible for a subject S\nto be justified in believing h on the basis of evidence\ne even if S does not have independent justification (of\nat least the same degree of S\u2019s justification for\nbelieving h) for believing a proposition p such that\np and e together entail h.\n\n\nAmpliativity would be true if, for example, we can be justified in\nbelieving the conclusion of an inductive argument (say, that all\nemeralds are green) on the basis of believing its premises (say, that\na properly selected group of emeralds have been observed to be green),\nwithout in addition being independently justified in believing any\nother proposition which, together with those premises, entails the\nconclusion (such as, for example, the proposition that if a properly\nselected sample of emeralds have all been green, then all emeralds are\ngreen).\n\nThe next principle is in conflict with what we presented above as an\nalternative possibility to Dretske\u2019s interpretation of the\nevidential structure of CP. Dretske\u2019s counterexample works, we\nsaid, only if CP holds that whatever justifies the subject in\nbelieving p is also what justifies her in believing q.\nBut there are two other possibilities. Maybe the evidential relation\nis reversed: whatever justifies us in believing q justifies us\nin believing p. Or maybe, we said, p itself, and not\nwhatever justifies us in believing p, justifies us in believing\nq. The next principle goes directly against this\npossibility:\n\n\nMere Lemmas: If S is justified in believing\np on the basis of some evidence e, then p itself\ncan justify S in believing some other proposition q only\nif e justifies S in believing q.\n\n\nWe call the principle \u201cMere Lemmas\u201d because the idea\nbehind it is that if a proposition is a mere lemma, in the sense that\nit derives all of its justification from some prior evidence e,\nthen it doesn\u2019t have justificatory powers of its own,\nindependent of the justificatory powers of e. Suppose, for\ninstance, that you start out by knowing that Jim has a pet, but you\ndon\u2019t know what kind of pet it is (the example is from Pryor\n2004). Then you come to know that it is a hairless pet. Now you become\njustified (perhaps to a small degree) in believing that Jim\u2019s\npet is a hairless dog. That is to say, whatever degree of\njustification you had before to believe that Jim\u2019s pet is a\nhairless dog, you are now somewhat more justified in believing that\nsame proposition. That Jim\u2019s pet is a hairless dog of course\nentails that Jim\u2019s pet is a dog. But your justification for\nbelieving that Jim\u2019s pet is a hairless dog cannot in any way be\ntransmuted into justification for believing that Jim\u2019s pet is a\ndog. Whatever degree of justification you had before for believing\nthat Jim\u2019s pet is a dog, you are now less justified in believing\nthat same proposition (because hairless dogs are a small minority of\nhairless pets).\n\nBut what about the example with which we introduced the idea that,\nsometimes, when e is evidence for p, then p\nitself can be evidence for q? The example was the following: we\ncan have adequate evidence for believing that 2 is a prime number, and\nthen that proposition itself (that 2 is a prime number) can justify us\nin believing that that there is at least one even prime number. But,\nwhen examined more closely, this is not an obvious counterexample to\nMere Lemmas. For, what could our adequate evidence that 2 is a prime\nnumber be? Presumably, it would be that 2 is divisible only by 1 and\n2. That just is the definition of what it means for 2 to be a prime\nnumber, however, so some may balk at the idea that it counts as\nevidence for the proposition in question (rather than being identical\nwith it). In any case, it would not count as a counterexample to Mere\nLemmas. For if we have no evidence for the proposition that 2 is a\nprime number, then the condition for the application of Mere Lemmas is\nnot\n satisfied.[9]\n If, on the other hand, our evidence is that 2 is divisible only by 1\nand 2, then that proposition itself is obviously evidence for the\nproposition that an even number is prime.\n\nOur final principle is the following:\n\n\nEntailment: If p entails q, then\nq cannot justify S in disbelieving p.\n\n\nThe idea behind this principle is that if p entails q,\nthen should q turn out to be true then things are as p\nsays they are, and so we can hardly use q as evidence against\np. We return to Entailment below, but first we show how these\nthree principles are in conflict with CP.\n\nAssume, with Ampliativity, that a subject S is justified in\nbelieving a proposition h on the basis of some evidence\ne without having independent justification for believing any\nother proposition p such that p together with e\nentails h. Notice that h obviously entails h or\nnot-e. Therefore, by CP, S is justified in believing h\nor not-e. But, of course, e together with h or\nnot-e entails h. Therefore, if S is justified in\nbelieving h on the basis of e, then there is a\nproposition which S is justified in believing and which\ntogether with e entails h.\n\nNotice that this is close to, but not quite, the negation of\nAmpliativity. For Ampliativity denies that there will be any such\nproposition which S is independently justified in\nbelieving, and for all we have said S\u2019s justification for\nbelieving h or not-e is not independent. Independent of what?\nOf S\u2019s justification for believing h itself. For\nall we have said so far, S might be justified in believing\nh or not-e on the basis of h, or on the basis of\ne itself.\n\nBut, given Mere Lemmas, h cannot justify S in believing\nany proposition unless e does. Therefore, the only option left\nopen, short of denying Ampliativity, is to argue that e itself\njustifies S in believing h or not-e. But that is\nincompatible with Entailment. For notice that for e to justify\nS in believing h or not-e is for e to justify\nS in disbelieving its negation, i.e., e and not-h.\nBut, of course, e and not-h entails e, and so the\nentailment principle has it that e cannot justify S in\ndisbelieving e and not-h\u2014i.e., e cannot justify\nS in believing h or not-e.\n\nAlthough this particular reconstruction is our own (for more on it,\nsee Comesa\u00f1a forthcoming), some philosophers have taken\narguments similar to it to count against CP (see, for example, Huemer\n2001 and Sharon & Spectre 2017, and cf. Comesa\u00f1a 2017).\nHowever, others have argued against Entailment (see, for example,\nPryor 2014a,b and Vogel 2014b), and yet others have argued that denying Ampliativity\nitself is not as absurd as it might sound (Comesa\u00f1a 2014a,b).\nThe argument cannot, therefore, be taken to be a conclusive blow\nagainst CP.\n\nFinally, some epistemological theories are in conflict with\n CP.[10]\n Robert Nozick\u2019s account of knowledge is the best such example.\nRoughly his account is this (Nozick 1981: 172\u2013187):\n\nS knows that p iff:\n\n S believes p;\n p is true;\n if p were true, S would believe p;\n if p were not true, S would not believe\np.\n\n\nNozick called his account a \u201ctracking\u201d account of\nknowledge because whenever S knows that \\(p, S\\)\u2019s\nbeliefs track p. Think of a guided missile tracking\nits target. If the target were to move left, the missile would move\nleft. If the target were not to move left, the missile would not move\nleft. According to the tracking account of knowledge our beliefs must\ntrack the truth if we are to have knowledge.\n\nThere is one important clarification of conditions 3 and 4 that is\ndiscussed by Nozick, namely, that the method by which S\nacquires the belief must be held constant from the actual world to the\npossible world. A doting grandmother might know that her grandchild is\nnot a thief on the basis of sufficiently good evidence, but would\nstill believe that he wasn\u2019t a thief, even if he were, because\nshe loves him. So, we must require that the grandmother use the same\nmethod in both the actual and the near possible worlds, for,\notherwise, condition (4) would exclude some clear cases of knowledge.\nThis is not the place to provide a full examination of Nozick\u2019s\naccount of\n knowledge.[11]\n What is crucial for our discussion is that it is easy to see that, if\nNozick\u2019s account is correct, closure will fail for knowledge in\njust the kind of case that the Cartesian Skeptic is putting forward\nbecause of condition (4). Suppose S knows that there is a chair\nbefore her. Would she know that she is not in a skeptical scenario in\nwhich it merely appears that there is a chair? If the fourth condition\nwere a necessary condition of knowledge, she would not know that\nbecause if she were in such a scenario, she would be fooled into\nthinking that she wasn\u2019t. Thus, either condition (4) is too\nstrong or CP fails.\n\nThere are some reasons for thinking that condition (4) is too strong.\nConsider, for instance, this case in the literature: You put a glass\nof ice-cold lemonade on a picnic table in your backyard. You go inside\nand get a telephone call from a friend and talk for half an hour. When\nyou hang up you remember that you had left the ice-cold lemonade\noutside exposed to the hot sun and come to believe that it isn\u2019t\nice-cold anymore. It would seem that you could know that. Indeed, if\nit were false, that could only be due to some bizarre circumstance.\nThus, if the lemonade were still ice-cold, you would believe that it\nwasn\u2019t (see Vogel 1987: 206). The moral of this (and similar)\ncases seems to be that sensitivity is not a correct condition on\nknowledge.\n\nThere is much more to say about CP and CP1, but we will move on to\nconsidering the argument\u2019s other premise.\n",
