Enabling positivity: social facts made reasons for action\n\n\nThe fulcrum and central question of natural law theories of law is:\nHow and why can law, and its positing in legislation, judicial\ndecisions, and customs, give its subjects sound reason for acting in\naccordance with it? How can a rule\u2019s, a judgment\u2019s, or an\ninstitution\u2019s legal (\u201cformal,\u201d \u201csystemic\u201d)\nvalidity, or its facticity or efficacy as a social phenomenon (e.g.,\nof official practice), make it authoritative in its subject\u2019s\ndeliberations? \n\n\nThe sense and force of these questions, and the main features of the\nkind of answer given by natural law theories, can be given a\npreliminary indication. On the one hand, natural law theory holds that\nlaw\u2019s \u201csource-based character\u201d\u2014its dependence upon\nsocial facts such as legislation, custom or judicially established\nprecedents\u2014is a fundamental and primary element in\n\u201claw\u2019s capacity to advance the common good, to secure human\nrights, or to govern with integrity\u201d (cf. Green and Adams 2019).\nOn the other hand (cf. Green 2003), the question \u201cwhether\nlaw is of its very nature morally problematic\u201d has from the\noutset been the subject of consideration by leaders of the tradition.\n(The first issue that Aquinas takes up about human law in his set-piece\ndiscussion of law, Summa Theologiae, I-II, q. 95 a. 1, is\nwhether human law [positive law] is beneficial\u2014might we not do\nbetter with exhortations and warnings, or with judges appointed simply\nto \u201cdo justice\u201d, or with wise leaders ruling as they see\nfit? And see I.3 below.)  Classic and leading contemporary texts of\nnatural law theory treat law as morally problematic, understanding it\nas a normally indispensable instrument of great good but one that\nreadily becomes an instrument of great evil unless its authors\nsteadily and vigilantly make it good by recognizing and fulfilling\ntheir moral duties to do so, both in settling the content of its rules\nand principles and in the procedures and institutions by which they\nmake and administer it. Natural law theories all understand law as a\nremedy against the great evils of, on the one side anarchy\n(lawlessness), and on the other side tyranny. And one of tyranny\u2019s\ncharacteristic forms is the co-optation of law to deploy it as a mask for\nfundamentally lawless decisions cloaked in the forms of law and\nlegality.\n",
