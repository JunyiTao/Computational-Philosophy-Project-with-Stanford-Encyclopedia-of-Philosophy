His gradual move from a highly stylized\nprose-with-variables to fully formalized systems precluded him from\nconsidering his logic as an uninterpreted system, as did Hilbert. From\nthe start, he considered his systems, even the fully formalized ones,\nto be comprised of constant expressions, primitive and defined, with a\nfixed intended meaning, which he attempted to make clear by examples\nand elucidations. He also considered all his axioms and theorems to be\ntrue. In this he was following Frege and Russell, who likewise did not\nenvisage an external source as somehow conveying a meaning upon\nexpressions and truth upon sentences of logic.\n\n This attitude to logic began to be overtaken by the development of\nlogical semantics, not least at the hands of his own former student\nTarski. The turning point came with the publication of Tarski\u2019s\nessay on the concept of truth in the languages of deductive sciences.\nThis paper was produced in a preliminary version in 1929\u201330,\nupdated when G\u00f6del\u2019s incompleteness results became known in\n1931, and eventually published in Polish in 1933. Le\u015bniewski was\nknown to be opposed to it. There are probably two reasons for this. One\nis that in his metalogical apparatus Tarski avails himself of set\ntheory. Even though his use is not extensive, it is an incursion of set\ntheory into the metatheory of logic, of which Le\u015bniewski could not\nbut disapprove. The other reason is probably that whereas in earlier\nparts of the monograph Tarski adheres faithfully to a conception of\nfinite types akin to Le\u015bniewski\u2019s theory of semantic\ncategories, in later parts he distances himself from this as an\nunwarranted restriction and accepts the propriety of transfinite\ntypes.\n\n There is in fact nothing inherently anti-semantic about\nLe\u015bniewski\u2019s logical systems. They may be given more\nstandard formulations and considered model-theoretically (cf. Stachniak\n1981). They may also be investigated metalogically in their own terms,\nand without reneging on Le\u015bniewski\u2019s scruples about abstract\nentities. The fact is that few people have considered it worth the\neffort of pursuing the project.\n",
