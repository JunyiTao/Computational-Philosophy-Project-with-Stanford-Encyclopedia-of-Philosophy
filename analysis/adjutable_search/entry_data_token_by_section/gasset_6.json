    "main_text": "Intellectual Development || Neo-Kantianism and the Search for Method\n2.1 Neo-Kantianism and the Search for Method\n\nOrtega dissociated himself from any particular school of thought,\nthough he would have been the first to acknowledge that a\nphilosopher\u2019s ideas become linked with previous philosophical\ntraditions. His attitude toward this intrinsic aspect of thought\nbecomes apparent when he remarked:\n\n\nIn our present philosophical posture and in the doctrine that is\nproduced by it, we view and take into account a substantial portion of\nprevious thought and themes relating to our discipline. This is\ntantamount to saying that past philosophies are our collaborators,\nwhich survive and are present in our own philosophy. (Obras,\nIX: 360)\n\n\nThe most important and obvious connection between intellectual\ncurrents in Europe and Ortega\u2019s thought, then, was the influence of\nGerman philosophy and, in particular, his studies at the University of\nMarburg. Neo-Kantianism in general and Hermann Cohen in particular\nprovided broad influence on the intellectual development of Ortega. He\nstudied closely with both Cohen and Paul Natorp, and the former served\nas Ortega\u2019s primary mentor. Ortega recalled this relationship in his\n\u201cPrologue for Germans\u201d (Obras, VIII: 13\u201358) where\nhe referred to Cohen, in retrospect, as \u201cmy teacher\u201d. Some\nof the critical influence of Marburg Neo-Kantianism is discernible in\nOrtega\u2019s writings. An attempt to distinguish philosophy from the\nassumptions and assertions\u2014whether idealistic or\npositivistic\u2014of speculative metaphysics characterized his\ngeneral philosophical position. Ortega rejected speculative\nmetaphysical systems and, like Cohen, repudiated natural science\u2019s\napproach to epistemology with its naturalistic and psychophysical\nexplanations of sensible reality of the \u201csubjective\u201d\nidealists. Although Ortega hesitates to proceed as far as Cohen, that\nis, to postulate the \u201cfacts\u201d of science to be determined\ncompletely by thought, a sort of Neo-Kantian metaphysics remains in\nhis fundamental philosophical point of view. For instead of positing\npure thought as solely real, Ortega replaced Cohen\u2019s logic with the\nnotion of \u201chuman life\u201d. In other words, Ortega\u2019s\ngeneralized view of existence contains human life in place of human\nlogic as the underlying unifying principle of reality. Ortega\u2019s major\nwritings were concerned with the idea of life as the \u201cdynamic\ndialogue between the individual and the world\u201d; he was not\nconcerned, as was Cohen, with assigning to external experience a\nreality that is contingent upon the principles of logic and\nmathematical physics. \u201cThe structure of life is\nfuturition\u201d, he wrote,\n\n\nthe most persistent leit motif of my writings, inspired\ncertainly by questions\u2014raised by the logic of Cohen\u2014which\nare very remote from the vital problem to which I apply it.\n(Obras, IV: 403\u20134)\n\n\nThis distinction drawn by Ortega between his vitalistic perspective\nand Cohen\u2019s all-embracing logic suggests that Ortega\u2019s experience at\nMarburg brought him closer to a critical Neo-Kantianism than to an\nabsolute Neo-Kantianism. The critical approach to philosophical issues\nbecame an important factor in influencing Ortega\u2019s thought and in the\nphilosophical training that he received. In his \u201cReflections on\nKant\u2019s Centenary\u201d in 1929, Ortega, in retrospect, referred\nmetaphorically to his struggle with Kant and Neo-Kantian philosophy as\nhaving occurred in a \u201cKantian prison\u201d, (Obras,\nIV: 25) ; and in his \u201cPrologue for Germans\u201d, he\nacknowledged his experience at the University of Marburg to have been\nan important factor in influencing his intellectual development.\n\u201cIn this city\u201d, he reflected, \u201cI passed the equinox\nof my youth; to it I owe half, at least, of my hopes and almost all my\ndiscipline\u201d (Obras, II: 558\u201359, VIII: 20\u201321).\n\nOrtega\u2019s return to Marburg in 1911 signaled another turn in his\nintellectual interests and his philosophical development: introduction\nto phenomenology. He recalled in his later writing that, while\nstudying at Marburg during those months, he and his fellow students of\nCohen and Natorp were deeply immersed in Neo-Kantian idealism. Ortega,\nNicolai Hartmann, Heinz Heimsoeth and Paul Scheffer often discussed\namongst themselves their agreements, disagreements, and\ndissatisfaction with the Neo-Kantianism of their mentors. The critical\nspirit of their intellectual \u201cspontaneity\u201d became evident\nin their reactions to all the reading they had undertaken on Kant,\nParmenides, and ancient philosophy in general. In recognizing the\nlimits of the Kantian revival and reflecting upon the current\ntendencies in art, literature and philosophy, Ortega and his\nintellectual cohort proceeded beyond Neo-Kantian idealism toward\n\u201cthe imaginary coast\u201d. Like any journey along imaginary\ncoasts, the uncertainty of the horizon demands a nautical device for\nthe means of navigation. For Ortega and his intellectual peers in\nsearch of a system, the intellectual ambiance provided them \u201cthe\ngift of a prodigious instrument: phenomenology\u201d (Obras,\nVIII: 20, 42). This \u201ccommon awakening\u201d of the young\ncohort, however, also signaled their separate paths. In 1911, they, as\na group of students, collectively challenged the positions of their\nteachers; on leaving Marburg, they had to pursue as individuals\nwhatever intellectual autonomy they were able to discover in\nphenomenology, and to put together whichever architectonic of a system\nwas attainable from it.\n",
