    "main_text": "Origins of the Universe\n3. Origins of the Universe\n\nCosmology confronts a distinctive challenge in accounting for the\norigin of the universe. In most other branches of physics the initial\nor boundary conditions of a system do not call out for theoretical\nexplanation. They may reflect, for example, the impact of the\nenvironment, or an arbitrary choice regarding when to cut off the\ndescription of a subsystem of interest. But in cosmology there are\nheated debates regarding what form a \u201ctheory of the initial\nstate\u201d should take, and what it should contribute to our\nunderstanding of the universe. This basic question regarding the\nnature of aims of a theory of origins has significant ramifications\nfor various lines of research in cosmology.\n",
