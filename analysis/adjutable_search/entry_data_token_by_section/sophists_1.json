    "main_text": "Nomos and Phusis\n2. Nomos and Phusis\n\n\nProtagoras\u2019 account of social morality in the Great Speech,\naccording to which the universal acceptance of justice and\nself-restraint is necessary for the perpetuation of society, and\nthereby for the preservation of the human species, places Protagoras\nfirmly on one side (the conservative side, we should note) of the\ndebate about the relation between law and convention (nomos)\non the one hand and nature or reality (phusis) on the other,\nwhich was central to moral and social thought in the fifth and fourth\ncenturies. The debate was fundamentally about the status of moral and\nother social norms; were such norms ever in some sense part of or\ngrounded in the reality of things, or were they in every case mere\nproducts of human customs, conventions or beliefs? The question was\ncrucial to the perceived authority of norms; both sides agreed in\nseeing nature as authoritative for correct human behavior, and as the\nultimate source of true value. Critics of traditional morality argued\nthat since that morality was nothing more than a human invention it\nthereby lacked genuine authority (which belonged to the realm of\nnature), thus sanctioning violation of traditional moral norms if the\nviolator could escape punishment or other bad consequences (while\n\u2018following nature\u2019), while the upholders of morality sought\nto show that morality, as reflected in traditional norms, was itself in\nsome sense a part or product of nature. We find examples of the\ncritical stance both in some Platonic dialogues and in some sophistic\nwritings. The starkest expression of the opposition between\nnomos and phusis is that expressed in the\nGorgias by Callicles, a pupil of Gorgias (though there is no\nsuggestion in the dialogue or elsewhere that Gorgias himself held that\nposition): Callicles holds that conventional morality is a contrivance\ndevised by the weak and unintelligent to inhibit the strong and\nintelligent from doing what they are entitled by nature to do, viz.\nexploit their inferiors for their own advantage. He is thus an inverted\nmoralist, who holds that what it is really right to do is what it is\nconventionally wrong to do. The true, authoritative norms are those\nwhich prevail in nature, as shown by the behavior of non-human animals\nsuch as beasts of prey; those who act in accordance with these norms\n\u2018do these things in accordance with the nature of justice and\n\u2026 the law of nature, but perhaps not in accordance with this one\nwhich we lay down\u2019 (Plato, Gorgias, 483e). The sophist Thrasymachus maintains a\nsimilar position in Book I of the Republic, though without\nCallicles\u2019 daring inversion of values. He agrees with Callicles\nin praising the ruthless individual (above all the tyrant) who is\ncapable of overcoming the restraints of morality, but whereas Callicles\ncalls such self-assertion naturally just, Thrasymachus abides by\nconventional morality in calling it unjust. Both agree that a\nsuccessful life of ruthless self-assertion is supreme happiness, and\nthat that is what nature prompts us to seek; both, then, accept the\nnormative authority of nature over nomos. The difference\nbetween them is that Callicles takes the further step of identifying\nthe authority of nature with that of real, as opposed to conventional\nmorality, whereas for Thrasymachus there is only one kind of morality,\nconventional morality, which has no authority. In Book II Glaucon\npresents a modified version of Thrasymachus\u2019 position; while\nmaintaining, as Protagoras does in the Great Speech, that humans adopt\nmoral conventions as a necessary survival strategy in a hostile world,\nhe insists that this involves a stunting of human nature, since people\nare obliged for self-protection to abandon the goal of\nself-satisfaction to which nature, as Thrasymachus insists, prompts\nthem. This assertion of egoism is supported by the thought-experiment\nof Gyges\u2019 ring; if, like the legendary Gyges, we had a magic ring\nwhich rendered us invisible, and hence immune from sanctions, we would\nall seek our own interest without restraint. We find a similar\ndown-grading of convention in favor of nature (though one lacking the\nimmoralist conclusions) in Hippias\u2019 speech in the\nProtagoras (337c\u2013d), where he urges that intellectuals\nsuch as are gathered in the house of Callias ought not to quarrel,\nsince, though according to artificial political conventions they are\ncitizens of many different cities, by nature they are all akin. The\nconventions which make them treat each other as strangers distort the\nreality by which they are all alike; hence they should recognise that\nreality by treating each other as friends and members of the same\nfamily, not as strangers. (The vignette gains added point from the\nfact that Hippias, speaking in Athens, is a citizen of Elis, a\nPeloponnesian state allied to Sparta in the war against Athens.)\nOutside Plato the most extended and explicit expression of the\n\u2018antinomian\u2019 stance is a well-known papyrus fragment of\nAntiphon (DK 87B44), which presents a number of contrasts between the\nrequirements of conventional morality and those of nature, to the\ndisadvantage of the former. Nature prompts us to do only what is\nadvantageous to us, and if we try to act contrary to its promptings we\ninevitably suffer for it as a natural consequence, whereas morality\ntypically restrains us from doing what is advantageous to ourselves\nand requires us to do what is disadvantageous, and if we violate the\nrequirements of morality we come to harm only if we are found\nout. Legal remedies are insufficient to prevent the law-abiding person\nfrom harm, since they are applicable only after the harm has been\ndone, and there is always the chance that the law-abiding person will\nlose his case anyway. Another part of the papyrus (fragment B)\nsuggests that some legal norms are self-contradictory; it is just to\nbear true witness in court, and unjust to wrong someone who has not\nwronged you. So someone who bears true witness against someone who has\nnot wronged him (e.g., witness A who truly testifies that he\nsaw B murder C) wrongs the person against whom he\nbears witness, and therefore acts both justly and unjustly. (The\nargument here depends on an illicit assimilation of harming with\nwronging: the witness certainly harms the murderer by his true\ntestimony, assuming that it leads to his conviction and execution, but\nthere is no reason to agree that in giving that testimony the witness\nwrongs the murderer.) Moreover, he thereby puts himself in danger of\nretaliation by the person whom he has wronged; so once again obedience\nto nomos is disadvantageous.\n\n\nOn the other side of the debate, as we have seen, we have\nProtagoras\u2019 contention in the Great Speech that law and morality\nare themselves natural developments, necessary for human survival and\nthe growth of civilization. Protagoras agrees with Glaucon that moral\nand legal conventions arise ultimately from the need for cooperation in\na hostile world, but rejects the latter\u2019s Thrasymachean egoism,\nwith its implication that morality is merely a second-best, to be\nrejected if circumstances allow the individual to pursue his natural\ngoal of unrestrained self-interest. Morality, for Protagoras, consists\nin justice and self-restraint, dispositions which involve the\nreplacement of Thrasymachean egoism by genuine regard for others as of\nequal moral status with oneself, and the crucial lesson of the Great\nSpeech is that those dispositions, so far from requiring the stunting\nof human nature as Glaucon maintains, in fact constitute the perfection\nof that nature. The idea that law and morality arise from the\nexigencies of human nature is also found in some fragments of\nDemocritus and in the so-called \u2018Anonymous Iamblichi\u2019 (DK\n89), a fragmentary text from the late fifth or early fourth century BCE\npreserved by the neo-Platonist Iamblichus (third\u2013fourth century CE: see\nTaylor 2007). This defence of the authority of nomos rests on\nthe idea that nomos itself, in the sense of legal and moral\nconvention, arises from phusis. A different, though related,\ndefence of nomos assumes a distinction between on the one hand\nthe moral and legal conventions of particular societies, assumed to be\nthe product of human agreement, and on the other certain fundamental\nmoral norms, alleged to be common to all societies, whose origin is to\nbe traced, not to any agreement, but to the original constitution of\nhuman nature, traditionally attributed to the creation of humans by the\ngods; these norms were generally agreed to include the obligations to\nrespect one\u2019s parents and to worship the gods. The conception of\nnatural or unwritten law is frequently appealed to in oratory and\ndrama, notably Sophocles\u2019 Antigone (see Guthrie 1969 pp.\n77\u20139, 117\u201331 and Taylor 2008); one of its most extended expressions\noccurs in Xenophon\u2019s Memorabilia IV.4.14\u201325, where in\nconversation with Socrates the sophist Hippias is represented as saying\nthat since the unwritten laws are common to all countries, they cannot\nhave arisen from agreement among humans who spoke different languages,\nand as being persuaded by Socrates that breach of such laws inevitably\nleads to bad consequences, thus guaranteeing the rationality of this\ndivine legislation. There is, then, no uniform sophistic position in\nthe nomos-phusis debate; different sophists, or associates of\nsophists, are found among the disputants on either side.\n",
