    "main_text": "The Representation of Objects || Mind-Independence\n5.4 Mind-Independence\n\nSome perceptual experiences arguably represent objects as existing\nindependently of the subject\u2019s mind (where something is\nmind-independent only if it does not depend for its existence on being\nperceived). One might think that representing that something exists\nindependently of being perceived is a precondition for representing\nthe occurrence of more mundane happenings in the external world, such\nas a tomato\u2019s being round, or a cat\u2019s sitting on a mat.\nRepresenting mind-independence is thus arguably a fundamental kind of\ncontent. In what different ways might experiences represent things as\nmind-independent?\n\nOne debate in this area (already mentioned in connection with spatial\nrepresentation) is whether a visual experience\u2019s representing\nthings as occupying three dimensions suffices to represent things as\nmind-independent (see Strawson 1958, Peacocke 1983, Smith 2002).\n\nAnother idea, prominent in the writings of Merleau-Ponty 1945 and\nHusserl 1900, is that some experiences are about things in the world\nexternal to the mind in virtue of representing possible interaction\nbetween the subject and the thing represented. For instance, according\nto one version of this view, a visual experience\u2019s representing\n(say) a bird as mind-independent consists (at least in part) in its\nrepresenting that if the subject moves relative to the bird, different\nparts of the bird will come into view, and that if something opaque\nmoves between the subject\u2019s eyes and the bird, then the bird\nwill be occluded. More generally, the idea is that an object looks\nmind-independent if it looks as if different perspectives on it may be\ntaken.\n\nIt is clear that subjects have some sort of expectations to this\neffect. But what concerns Merleau-Ponty and Husserl is what bearing\nthese expectations have on experience itself. These two philosophers\nagreed that experience would not be what it is without such\nexpectations; but they disagreed about how exactly they are\nincorporated into experience. According to Merleau-Ponty, the\n\u2018expectations\u2019 took the form of \u2018readiness\u2019 on\nthe part of the subject to move her body relative to an object in\norder to get a better view, if she so wished. Rather than posit mental\nstates that represent the possibility and possible results of\nsuch interaction, Merleau-Ponty thought that such representation was\nimplicit in the subject\u2019s own dispositions. This idea has been\ndeveloped in the literature on so-called \u2018embodied\ncognition\u2019 (see Clark 1997, Hurley 2000, Noe and O\u2019Regan\n2001). Husserl, in contrast, held that the subject\u2019s\nexpectations about how phenomenology would change with\nchanges in the perceiver\u2019s apparent movement were presented in\nexperience along with other properties, such as location and shape.\nSimilar ideas are developed in Smith 2002 and Siegel 2006b.\n\nA third idea in the area is that tactile experiences themselves, by\nvirtue of their phenomenology alone, represent things as external to\nthe subject\u2019s body. Consider the experience of grasping a\nrounded bottle. In experiencing the limits of one\u2019s body, one\nseems simultaneously to experience the surfaces of things external to\none. This seem to yield two ways of describing tactile phenomenology:\nit involves both a feeling of pressure, located roughly at the places\non the hands where the glass is touching; and a feeling of something\nspatially external to the body, located at the point where it touches\nthe body. Moreover, tactile experiences of grasping a rounded bottle\nseems to represent the surfaces touching each part of the hand as\nsurfaces that are part of the same object, so that it is also part of\nwhat the experience represents that the surfaces extend through space\nnot occupied by the body. If so, then tactile experiences represent\nboth happenings inside the body and things outside the body.\n\nNow, in principle something could exist in the space outside a\nsubject\u2019s body, yet not exist independently of that\nsubject\u2019s mind. But assuming that things outside the body are\nnot also internal to the mind, this would be a way of representing\nthings outside the mind as well. For further discussion of the\nrelation between tactile experience and mind-independence, see\nO\u2019Shaughnessy 1989, Martin 1992b, Smith 2002, Condillac\n1947.\n",
