    "main_text": "Motivation and Preliminaries || The Interpretation of Probability\n1.3 The Interpretation of Probability\n\nCausal relations are normally thought to be objective features of the\nworld. If they are to be captured in terms of probability theory, then\nprobability assignments should represent some objective feature of the\nworld. There are a number of attempts to interpret probabilities\nobjectively, the most prominent being frequency\ninterpretations and propensity interpretations. Most\nproponents of probabilistic theories of causation have understood\nprobabilities in one of these two ways. Notable exceptions are Suppes\n(1970), who takes probability to be a feature of a model of a\nscientific theory; and Skyrms (1980), who understands the relevant\nprobabilities to be the subjective probabilities of a certain kind of\nrational agent.\n",
