    "main_text": "Equality of Educational Opportunity as an Independent Concern || The Value of Education\n1.1 The Value of Education\n\nEducation has both instrumental and intrinsic value for individuals\nand for societies as a whole. As the U.S. Supreme Court stated in its\nunanimous decision in Brown v. Board of Education (1954),\n\u201cIn these days, it is doubtful that any child may reasonably be\nexpected to succeed in life if he is denied the opportunity of an\neducation\u201d. The instrumental goals of K\u201312 education for\nindividuals include access to higher education and a constellation of\nprivate benefits that follow college education such as access to\ninteresting jobs with more vacation time and better health care;\ngreater personal and professional mobility, better decision-making\nskills (Institute for Higher Education Policy 1998) and more autonomy\nat work. Research further shows that education levels are correlated\nwith health and wealth: the more education a person has, the healthier\nand wealthier she is likely to be. At the same time, education is also\nconsidered intrinsically valuable. Developing one\u2019s skills and\ntalents can be enjoyable or good in itself and a central component of\na flourishing life, regardless of the consequences this has for wealth\nor health.\n\nIn addition to the instrumental and intrinsic value of education to an\nindividual, education is also valuable for society. All societies\nbenefit from productive and knowledgeable workers who can generate\nsocial surplus and respond to preferences. Furthermore, democratic\nsocieties need to create citizens who are capable of participating in\nthe project of shared governance. The correlation between educational\nattainment and civic participation is strong and well-documented:\neducated citizens have more opportunities to obtain and exercise civic\nskills, are more interested in and informed about politics, and in\nturn, are more likely to vote (Verba, Schlozman, & Brady 1995:\n432\u2013437, 445; Dee 2004).\n\nIt is therefore relatively uncontroversial to say that education is a\nhighly valuable good to both individuals and to society, especially to\ndemocratic societies. This makes questions about who has access to\nhigh-quality educational opportunities, and how educational\nopportunities should be distributed, particularly important.\n",
