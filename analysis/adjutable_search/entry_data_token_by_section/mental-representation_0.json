    "main_text": "The Representational Theory of Mind\n1. The Representational Theory of Mind\n\nThe Representational Theory of Mind (RTM) (which goes back at least to\nAristotle) takes as its starting point commonsense mental states, such\nas thoughts, beliefs, desires, perceptions and imagings. Such states\nare said to have \u201cintentionality\u201d \u2013 they are\nabout or refer to things, and may be evaluated with\nrespect to properties like consistency, truth, appropriateness and\naccuracy. (For example, the thought that cousins are not related is\ninconsistent, the belief that Elvis is dead is true, the desire to eat\nthe moon is inappropriate, a visual experience of a ripe strawberry as\nred is accurate, an imaging of George Washington with dreadlocks is\ninaccurate.)\n\nRTM defines such intentional mental states as relations to mental\nrepresentations, and explains the intentionality of the former in\nterms of the semantic properties of the latter. For example, to\nbelieve that Elvis is dead is to be appropriately related to a mental\nrepresentation whose propositional content is that Elvis is\ndead. (The desire that Elvis be dead, the fear\nthat he is dead, the regret that he is dead, etc., involve\ndifferent relations to the same mental representation.) To perceive a\nstrawberry is, on the representational view, to have a sensory\nexperience of some kind which is appropriately related to (e.g.,\ncaused by) the strawberry.\n\nRTM also understands mental processes such as thinking, reasoning and\nimagining as sequences of intentional mental states. For example, to\nimagine the moon rising over a mountain is, inter alia, to\nentertain a series of mental images of the moon (and a mountain). To\ninfer a proposition q from the propositions p and\nif p then q is (inter alia) to have a sequence of\nthoughts of the form p, if p then q, q.\n\nContemporary philosophers of mind have typically supposed (or at least\nhoped) that the mind can be naturalized \u2013\ni.e., that all mental facts have explanations in the terms of natural\nscience. This assumption is shared within cognitive science, which\nattempts to provide accounts of mental states and processes in terms\n(ultimately) of features of the brain and central nervous system. In\nthe course of doing so, the various sub-disciplines of cognitive\nscience (including cognitive and computational psychology and\ncognitive and computational neuroscience) postulate a number of\ndifferent kinds of structures and processes, many of which are not\ndirectly implicated by mental states and processes as commonsensically\nconceived. There remains, however, a shared commitment to the idea\nthat mental states and processes are to be explained in terms of\nmental representations.\n\nIn philosophy, recent debates about mental representation have\ncentered around the existence of propositional attitudes (beliefs,\ndesires, etc.) and the determination of their contents (how they come\nto be about what they are about), and the existence of phenomenal\nproperties and their relation to the content of thought and perceptual\nexperience. Within cognitive science itself, the philosophically\nrelevant debates have been focused on the computational architecture\nof the brain and central nervous system, and the compatibility of\nscientific and commonsense accounts of mentality.\n",
