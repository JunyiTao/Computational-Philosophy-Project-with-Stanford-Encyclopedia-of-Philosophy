    "main_text": "Evolutionary Models\n8. Conclusion\n\nThe study of social norms can help us understand a wide variety of\nseemingly puzzling behaviors. According to some accounts, a social\nnorm results from conditional preferences for conforming to a relevant\nbehavioral rule. Such preferences are conditional on two different\nkinds of beliefs: empirical and normative expectations.\n\nThis and other accounts of social norms still leave much to be\ninvestigated. Explaining how normative expectations come to exist\nremains an open question. Another open question to consider is how one\ncould intervene to change socially harmful norms. While there have\nbeen initial investigations into these questions (Bicchieri 2016,\nMuldoon 2018a, 2018b), there is much more work to be done. One\nfrontier in this area is in deploying behavioral tools such as nudging\nfor fostering norm changes (Bicchieri 2022, 2023).\n\nFinally, we stress that different contextual factors (such as\nthe framing and characteristics of the strategic problem, the role one\nis assigned, the social category with which one identifies, as well as\nhistorical and chance events) often come to be associated with\ndifferent notions of \u201cappropriate behavior\u201d. Accounting\nfor endogenous expectations is therefore key to a full understanding\nof norm-driven behavior. More research\u2014both theoretical and\nexperimental\u2014is needed to further illuminate the impact of\nexpectations on strategic decisions.\n",
