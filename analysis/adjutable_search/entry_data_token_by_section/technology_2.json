    "main_text": "Historical Developments || A Basic Ambiguity in the Meaning of Technology\n1.3 A Basic Ambiguity in the Meaning of Technology\n\nMitcham contrasts \u2018humanities philosophy of technology\u2019 to\n\u2018engineering philosophy of technology\u2019, where the latter\nrefers to philosophical views developed by engineers or technologists\nas \u201cattempts \u2026 to elaborate a technological\nphilosophy\u201d (1994: 17). Mitcham discusses only a handful of\npeople as engineering philosophers of technology: Ernst Kapp, Peter\nEngelmeier, Friedrich Dessauer, and much more briefly Jacques Lafitte,\nGilbert Simondon, Hendrik van Riessen, Juan David Garc\u00eda Bacca,\nR. Buckminster Fuller and Mario Bunge. The label \u2018engineering\nphilosophy of technology\u2019 raises serious questions: many of the\npersons discussed hardly classify as engineers or technologists. It is\nalso not very clear how the notion of \u2018a technological\nphilosophy\u2019 should be understood. As philosophers, these authors\nseem all to be rather isolated figures, whose work shows little\noverlap and who seem to be sharing mainly the absence of a\n\u2018working relation\u2019 with established philosophical\ndisciplines. It is not so clear what sorts of questions and concerns\nunderlie the notion of \u2018engineering philosophy of\ntechnology\u2019. A larger role for systematic philosophy could bring\nit quite close to some examples of humanities philosophy of\ntechnology, for instance the work of Jacques Ellul, where the analyses\nwould be rather similar and the remaining differences would be ones of\nattitude or appreciation.\n\nIn the next section we discuss in more detail a form of philosophy of\ntechnology that we consider to occupy, currently, the position of\nalternative to the humanities philosophy of technology. It emerged in\nthe 1960s and gained momentum in the past twenty to twenty-five years.\nThis form of the philosophy of technology, which may be called\n\u2018analytic\u2019, is not primarily concerned with the relations\nbetween technology and society but with technology itself. It\nexpressly does not look upon technology as a \u2018black box\u2019\nbut as a phenomenon that should be studied in detail. It does not\nregard technology as such as a practice but as something grounded in a\npractice, basically the practice of engineering. It analyses this\npractice, its goals, its concepts and its methods, and it relates its\nfindings to various themes from philosophy.\n\nIn seeing technology as grounded in a practice sustained by engineers,\nsimilar to the way philosophy of science focuses on the practice of\nscience as sustained by scientists, analytic philosophy of technology\ncould be thought to amount to the philosophy of engineering. Indeed\nmany of the issues related to design, discussed below in Sections\n 2.3\n and\n 2.4,\n could be singled out as forming the subject matter of a philosophy of\nengineering. The metaphysical issues discussed in Section\n 2.5\n could not, however, and analytic philosophy of technology is\ntherefore significantly broader than philosophy of engineering. The\nvery title of Philosophy of Technology and Engineering\nSciences (Meijers 2009), an extensive up-to-date overview, which\ncontains contributions to all of the topics treated in the next\nsection, suggests that technology and engineering do not coincide, but\nthe book does not specifically address what distinguishes technology\nfrom engineering and how they are related. In fact, the existence of\nhumanities philosophy of technology and analytic philosophy of\ntechnology next to one another reflects a basic ambiguity in the\nnotion of technology that the philosophical work that has been going\non has hardly succeeded in clarifying.\n\nTechnology can be said to have two aspects or dimensions, which can be\nreferred to as instrumentality and productivity.\nInstrumentality covers the totality of human endeavours to control\ntheir lives and their environments by interfering with the world in an\ninstrumental way, by using things in a purposeful and clever way.\nProductivity covers the totality of human endeavours to bring into\nexistence new things through which certain things can be realized in a\ncontrolled and clever way. For the study of the dimension of\ninstrumentality, it is in principle irrelevant whether the things that\nare made use of in controlling our lives and environments have been\nproduced by us first; if we somehow could rely on natural objects to\nalways be available to serve our purposes, the analysis of\ninstrumentality and its consequences for how we live our lives would\nnot necessarily be affected. Likewise, for the analysis of what is\ninvolved in the making of artifacts, and how the notion of artifact\nand of something new being brought into existence are to be\nunderstood, it is to a large extent irrelevant how human life, culture\nand society are changed as a result of the artifacts that are in fact\nproduced. Notwithstanding its fundamental character, the ambiguity\nnoted here seems hardly to be confronted directly in the literature.\nIt is addressed by Lawson (2008, 2017) and by Franssen and Koller\n(2016).\n\nHumanities philosophy of technology has been interested predominantly\nin the instrumentality dimension, whereas analytic philosophy of\ntechnology has focused on the productivity dimension. But technology\nas one of the basic phenomena of modern society, if not the most basic\none, clearly is constituted by the processes centering on and\ninvolving both dimensions. It has proved difficult, however, to come\nto an overarching approach in which the interaction between these two\ndimensions of technology are adequately dealt with\u2014no doubt\npartly due to the great differences in philosophical orientation and\nmethodology associated with the two traditions and their separate\nfoci. To improve this situation is arguably the most urgent challenge\nthat the field of philosophy of technology as a whole is facing, since\nthe continuation of the two orientations leading their separate lives\nthreatens its unity and coherence as a discipline in the first place.\nIndeed, during the past ten to fifteen years the philosophy of\nengineering has established itself as a subdiscipline within the\nphilosophy of technology, for which a comprehensive handbook was\nedited recently by Michelfelder and Doorn (2021). \n\nAfter presenting the major issues of philosophical relevance in\ntechnology and engineering that are studied by analytic philosophers\nof technology in the next section, we discuss the problems and\nchallenges that technology poses for the society in which it is\npracticed in the third and final section.\n",
