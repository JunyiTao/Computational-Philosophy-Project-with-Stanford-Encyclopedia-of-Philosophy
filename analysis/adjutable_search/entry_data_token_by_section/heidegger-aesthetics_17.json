    "main_text": "Heidegger for Art, Introduction:  The Three Pillars of Heidegger\u2019s Understanding of Art || Representing Nothing:  Transcending Aesthetic Subjectivism from Within\n3.6 Representing Nothing:  Transcending Aesthetic Subjectivism from Within\n\n\nFor Heidegger, then, the essential tension between\n\u201cworld\u201d and \u201cearth\u201d\u2014the dynamic\nback-and-forth whereby some things (or aspects of things) cannot emerge\ninto the light of our intelligible worlds without others withdrawing\ninto the background (which means that it is impossible for everything to take place\nin intelligibility all at once)\u2014names the basic conflict in the\nstructure of intelligibility, a conflict which is ultimately\n responsible for the historical unfolding of what\n is.[71]\nOnce we\nrealize this, we can see that Heidegger\u2019s only other major\nreference to Van Gogh\u2019s painting (in 1935\u2019s The\nIntroduction to Metaphysics) again follows the same basic sequence\nof phenomenological steps. This important passage turns once more\non the double meaning of (the) \u201cnothing\u201d (which Heidegger\nagain seeks to suggest with the subtly ambiguous locution,\n\u201cnothing else\u201d):\n\n\nA painting by Van Gogh: a pair of tough farmer\u2019s shoes,\nnothing else [sonst nichts]. The picture really\nrepresents nothing [Das Bild stellt eigentlich nichts\ndar]. Yet, what is there, with that you are\nimmediately alone, as if on a late autumn evening, when the last potato\nfires have burned out, you yourself were heading wearily home from the\nfield with your hoe. (IM 37\u20138/GA40 38)\n\n\nReaders often take Heidegger\u2019s deliberately provocative claim\nthat \u201c[t]he picture really represents nothing\u201d as a\nflat-footed assertion that Van Gogh\u2019s painting does not\nrepresent\n shoes.[72]\nBut that obscures Heidegger\u2019s deeper point and, in fact, would\nmake no more sense than if, beneath\n \u201cThe Treason of Images\u201d\n(1929)\u2014Magritte\u2019s realistic\nrepresentation of a pipe against a blank background\u2014 Magritte had painted not the famous words, \u201cThis is not a pipe [Ceci\nn\u2019est pas une pipe]\u201d but\ninstead: \u201cThis is not\na representation of a pipe.\u201d For, Magritte\u2019s\nmost obvious point is that a representation of a pipe (be it pictorial\nor linguistic) is not itself a pipe. The surreal effect of\n\u201cThe Treason of Images\u201d comes from the way it encourages\nviewers to confront the usually unnoticed distance between\nrepresentations and the things they represent. \u201cThis is not\na pipe\u201d calls the very obviousness of representation into\nquestion, and so points toward the mysteries concealed beneath the\nsystem of representation we usually take for\n granted.[73]\n\n\nThe effect of Heidegger\u2019s provocative claim about Van\nGogh\u2019s painting of \u201cA Pair of Shoes\u201d is\nsimilar. When Heidegger states that \u201c[t]he picture really\nrepresents nothing,\u201d he is not advancing the bizarre claim that\nVan Gogh\u2019s painting of a pair of shoes does not represent\nshoes. The fact that Van Gogh\u2019s painting represents shoes\nis the first thing anyone notices about it and it is also (as we have\nseen) the first thing Heidegger himself mentioned about it: Van\nGogh\u2019s picture \u201crepresents [darstellt] a pair of\nfarmer\u2019s shoes\u201d (PLT 19/GA5 3). Heidegger is not\nretracting that claim but, instead, building upon it, suggesting that\nVan Gogh\u2019s painting does more than just represent a pair of\nshoes: Van Gogh\u2019s painting \u201creally, properly, or\nauthentically\u201d (eigentlich) represents (the)\nnothing. Indeed, it represents (the) nothing in a way that\nultimately allows us to transcend aesthetic representation from\nwithin\u2014by getting us back in touch with a more basic level of\nhuman existence which the order of objective representations\npresupposes but cannot fully\n recapture.[74]\n\n\nThe suggestively ambiguous phrase, \u201cnothing out of the\nordinary,\u201d might make a good title for Heidegger\u2019s attempt\nto show how the mysterious \u201cnothing\u201d emerges from Van\nGogh\u2019s painting of a seemingly ordinary pair of shoes. For\nHeidegger, it is not that the person who broke in these empty shoes,\nalthough absent from the painting, nevertheless remains present there\nin his or her very absence. It is true, as Edwards (2004, p. 54)\nsuggests, that the palpable presence of the missing person whose feet\nshaped the shoes that Van Gogh painted quite naturally leads those who\nstudy the painting carefully to wonder, Whose shoes\nwere these originally? And that question, in turn, helps fuel the\ncontroversy that still surrounds Heidegger\u2019s interpretation of\nthe painting (see section 4). For Heidegger, however, the\n\u201cnothing\u201d that is visible in Van Gogh\u2019s painting is\nnot the haunting presence of these shoes\u2019 absent owner but,\ninstead, the equally paradoxical (and no less phenomenologically\ndiscernible) appearance of that which is neither an entity nor merely\nnothing at all and yet conditions our experience of all\nentities.  We can encounter this active nothing phenomenologically as we learn to be receptive to the textural hints of that which is not yet a thing and yet offers itself, in the suggestive hints of a \u201coutline\u201d or \u201crift-structure\u201d, beckoning to be gestated and so brought into being by our disclosive capacities.\n\n\nWhat Heidegger finally wants to suggest, then, is not just that\nthe nothing emerges from the ordinary (that the nothing makes itself\nvisible in Van Gogh\u2019s painting of an ordinary pair of shoes) but\nalso the reverse, that what we now think of as \u201cordinary\u201d\nfirst originated out of the \u201cnothing,\u201d through the\nessential struggle between earth and world. For, in\nHeidegger\u2019s view, initially extraordinary creations, once brought\ninto being, eventually become stabilized in intelligibility and so\nperceived as merely \u201cordinary\u201d (in much the same way that\nwhat begins as a revealing poetic insight is eventually routinized into\na worn-out\n clich\u00e9).[75]\nAs he thus puts it:\n\n\nDoes truth, then, originate out of nothing? In fact it does,\nif by \u201cnothing\u201d we mean no more than that which is not a\nbeing, and if \u201ca being\u201d represents that which is\nobjectively on hand [Vorhandene] in the normal way\u2014a\n[way of conceiving] \u201cbeing,\u201d the merely putative truth of\nwhich comes to light and thereby becomes shattered by the\nstanding-there of the work. (PLT 71/GA5 59)\n\n\nIn other words, the encounter with the nothing in the work of art\n\u201cshatters\u201d the taken-for-granted obviousness of the modern\ntheoretical framework in which subjects seek to master external\nobjects, a framework implicit in the basic aesthetic view according to\nwhich subjects undergo intensive experiences of art objects. The\nphenomenological encounter with Van Gogh\u2019s painting undermines\nthe obviousness of the modern worldview by returning us directly to the\nprimordial level of engaged existence in which subject and object have\nnot yet been differentiated. Indeed, Heidegger thinks that\naesthetics transcends itself from within in the encounter with Van\nGogh\u2019s painting because this encounter with the work of art\nbrings us back to this engaged level of existence in a particularly\nlucid and revealing way. This lucid encounter, moreover, is\nsupposed to help us transform our guiding sense of what beings are,\nleading us beyond both the modern and late-modern understandings of\nbeing as objects to be mastered and resources to be optimized.\nBut how exactly?\n\n\nHeidegger thinks we can transcend modern aesthetics from within if,\nin what begins as an ordinary aesthetic experience of an\nobject\u2014Van Gogh\u2019s painting of a pair of shoes\u2014that\nstands opposite us (as if external to our own subjectivity), we notice\nand carefully attend to the way these shoes take shape on and against\nan inconspicuously dynamic background (the \u201cnoth-ing\u201d\nrethought as \u201cearth\u201d), a background which is not nothing at\nall but, rather, both supports and exceeds the intelligible world that\nemerges from\n it.[76]\nOur experience of an aesthetic object\ntranscends itself here because, in order to encounter Van Gogh\u2019s\nartwork in its full phenomenological richness (by recognizing the\nstruggle between \u201cearth and world\u201d that is preserved in the\npainting), we can no longer approach the meaning of this work as if\nthis meaning were entirely contained within an external object standing\napart from us. Our phenomenological encounter with Van\nGogh\u2019s painting shows us that its meaning is neither located\nentirely in the object standing over against us nor is it simply\nprojected by our subjectivity onto an inherently meaningless work; the\nwork\u2019s meaning must instead be inconspicuously accomplished in\nour own engagement with the work. Through our engagement with Van\nGogh\u2019s painting, Heidegger suggests, we lucidly encounter the\nnegotiation by which we are always-already making sense of the\nworld.\n\n\nIt is crucial for Heidegger that we not reinterpret this encounter\nas a subject\u2019s selective cognitive and perceptual uptake of an\nobjective world. What we encounter in art is something more\ndeeply rooted in existence which the modern subject/object dichotomy\nskates right over. Our encounter with the work teaches us that\nthat meaning does not happen solely in the art object or the viewing\nsubject but instead takes place, we could say, between us and\nthe work. This, again, is an ontological truth; it holds\ntrue of (human) existence in general. To be Dasein is to\nbe \u201cthe being of the \u2018between\u2019\u201d (HCT\n251/GA20 346\u20137), as Heidegger first put it in 1925.\nThis means that our encounter with Van Gogh\u2019s painting helps us\nto realize and so become what we are. For, what we\nlucidly encounter in art is our making-sense of the place in which we\nfind ourselves, a fundamental \u201cworld-disclosing\u201d that is\nalways already at work in human \u201cexistence,\u201d our\nstanding-out into intelligibility. For Heidegger, Van\nGogh\u2019s painting allows us to lucidly encounter what we already\nare, most fundamentally, but without realizing it\u2014namely,\nDasein, \u201cbeing-here,\u201d the active making\nintelligible of the place in which we find ourselves. Art teaches\nus to become what we already are by allowing us lucidly to undergo the\ntransition from understanding and experiencing ourselves as\nmeaning-bestowing subjects standing over against an objective world to\nrecognizing that, at a deeper level, we are always implicitly\nparticipating in the making-intelligible of our\n worlds.[77]\n",
