    "main_text": "Sin as State || Inevitability of Sinful Actions\n4.5 Inevitability of Sinful Actions\n\nEven the rejection of original guilt doesn\u2019t solve all the\nconcerns related to the third component of the doctrine of original\nsin: constitutional fault also faces philosophical and theological\nchallenges. While some argue that constitutional fault merely inclines\none to commit sinful acts (see Swinburne 1989: 138), most have held\nthat acts of sin are inevitable given the state of original sin (Crisp\n2019: 150). As Paul Copan puts it,\n\n\nthough we do not sin necessarily (that is, it is not assured that we\nmust commit this or that particular sin), we sin inevitably (that is,\nin addition to our propensity to sin, given the vast array of\nopportunities to sin, we eventually do sin at some point. (Copan 2003:\n531)\n\n\nPaul Franks raises the following problem for views like Copan\u2019s\n(and Plantinga\u2019s and Wyma\u2019s), which affirm the\ninevitability of sin without original guilt. On these views, the\nfollowing claim is true:\n\n\n(1)\nNecessarily in a world tainted by original sin, (a) every human\nsubsequent to Adam and Eve [where those names are understood to refer\nto whoever the first sinners happen to be in whatever world is tainted\nby sin] is born in a condition such that it is inevitable that she sin\n(given that she performs at least one morally significant action), but\n(b) it is not inevitable that she sin on any given occasion. (Franks\n2012, 6f; citations omitted)\n\n\n\n(This claim would seem to entail that every world tainted by original\nsin includes sinners who give birth to other creatures capable of\nsinning. That looks to be false if there\u2019s a world where the\nfirst sinners are annihilated immediately afterwards and new human\nbeings are created, but Franks doesn\u2019t consider this\npossibility.) Now consider a possible world in which a human performs\nonly one morally significant action in their lifetime. This would mean\nthat:\n\n\n(2)\nPossibly, some human performs only one morally significant action\nin her lifetime. (Franks 2012: 7)\n\n\n\nFranks thinks that the truth of (2) \u201cseems assured\u201d and\nfinds \u201cno reason one could give for thinking it to be\nfalse\u201d (Franks 2012: 7 and 11). However, according to (1a)\nabove, it is true of the human in question that they inevitably sin in\nthat particular action. That is, it follows from (1a) and (2) that\n\n\n(3)\nIf some human performs only one morally significant action in\n[their] lifetime, then that action is inevitably sinful. (Franks 2012:\n7)\n\n\n\nHowever, from (1b) it follows that:\n\n\n(4)\nIf some human performs only one morally significant action in\n[their] lifetime, then that action is not inevitably sinful. (Franks\n2012: 7)\n\n\n\n(3) and (4) together entail a contradiction.\n\nOne way to reject (1b) is to accept a compatibilist view on which at\nleast some human free actions, namely those in which one sins, are\ndetermined by God. But those with libertarian commitments seem to be\ncommitted to (1b). Since Franks is a libertarian, he rejects that the\nconstitutional fault of original sin necessitates sinful actions:\n\u201cwe are influenced by a fallen world to sin, but are free at any\npoint to refrain from sinning\u201d (Franks 2012: 370). As mentioned\nabove, Swinburne also rejects the inevitability of sin on the basis of\noriginal sin:\n\n\nAdam\u2019s responsibility for our sinfulness is confined to a\nresponsibility for beginning the social transmission of morality (as\nsuch a good thing) which made sin possible, but a morality which, as a\nresult of his own sinful example and perhaps false moral beliefs, was\nno doubt a corrupt morality and so made it easier for our genetically\ninherited proneness to sin to work in Adam\u2019s successors.\n(Swinburne 1989: 143)\n\n\nAccording to Swinburne, sinful acts are \u201calmost\nunavoidable\u201d but not inevitable. Those incompatibilists who want\nto hold that committing at least one sinful action is inevitable while\navoiding the inevitability (and thus non-responsibility) of each\nparticular sinful action need to provide an account of what ensures\nsinful action.\n",
