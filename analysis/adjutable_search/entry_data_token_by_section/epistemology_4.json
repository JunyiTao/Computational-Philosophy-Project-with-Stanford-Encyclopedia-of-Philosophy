    "main_text": "The Varieties of Cognitive Success || What Makes It Success?\n1.5 What Makes It Success?\n\nWhat makes it the case that something counts as a form of cognitive\nsuccess? For instance, why think that knowing the capital\nof Pakistan is a cognitive success, rather than just another\ncognitive state that an agent can occupy, like having 70%\nconfidence that Islamabad is the capital of Pakistan? Not every\ncognitive state enjoys cognitive success. Knowing, understanding,\nmastering\u2014these are cognitive successes. But being 70% confident\nin a proposition is not, in and of itself, a cognitive success, even\nif that state of confidence may be partly constitutive of an\nagent\u2019s cognitive success when the agent holds it in the right\ncircumstances and for the right reason. What makes the difference?\n\nRecent work on this issue tends to defend one of the following three\nanswers to this question: contractualism, consequentialism, or\nconstitutivism. The contractualist says that a particular cognitive\nstate counts as a kind of success because the practice of so counting\nit serves certain widely held practical interests. For instance,\naccording to Craig (1990), we describe a person as\n\u201cknowing\u201d something as a way of signaling that her\ntestimony with respect to that thing is to be trusted. The\nconsequentialist says that a particular cognitive state counts as a\nkind of success because it tends to constitute or tends to promote\nsome crucial benefit. According to some consequentialists, the benefit\nin question is that of having true beliefs and lacking false beliefs\n(see BonJour 1985, Audi 1993). According to others, it is the benefit\nof having a comprehensive understanding of reality. According to\nothers, it is a benefit that is not narrowly epistemic, e.g., living a\ngood life, or being an effective agent, or spreading one\u2019s gene\npool. Finally, the constitutivist may say that a particular cognitive\nstate counts as a kind of success if it is the constitutive aim of\nsome feature of our lives to achieve that state (see Korsgaard 2009\nfor a defense of constitutivism concerning norms of rationality). For\ninstance, the constitutivist might say that knowledge is a kind of\ncognitive success by virtue of being the constitutive aim of belief,\nor that understanding is a kind of cognitive success by virtue of\nbeing the constitutive aim of reasoning, or that practical wisdom is a\nkind of cognitive success by virtue of being the constitutive aim of\nall human activity. Of course, there are philosophers who count as\n\u201cconstitutivists\u201d by virtue of thinking, say, that\nknowledge is the constitutive aim of belief\u2014but these same\nphilosophers are not thereby committed to the constitutivism described\nhere, since they are not committed to this explanation of what\nmakes knowledge a kind of cognitive success.\n\nOf course, it\u2019s possible that one of the three answers mentioned\nabove is correct for some kinds of success, while another of the three\nanswers is correct for other kinds of success. Consider, for instance,\nthe difference between the kind of success involved in having a state\nthat is fitting (for instance, holding a belief\nknowledgeably), and the kind of success involved in having a\nstate that is valuable (for instance, holding a belief the holding of\nwhich is beneficial). Perhaps the constitutivist can explain\nthe former kind of success better than the consequentialist can, but\nthe consequentialist can explain the latter kind of success better\nthan the constitutivist can. Of course, if and when the demands of\nthese different kinds of success conflict, the agent will face the\nquestion of how to proceed. Much recent work in epistemology has\nattempted to adjudicate that question, or to interrogate the\nassumption of possible conflict that gives rise to it (see, for\ninstance, Maru\u0161i\u0107 2015, McCormick 2015, and Rinard 2017a\nand 2019b).\n\nThese different ways of understanding cognitive success each give rise\nto a different understanding of the range of ways in which cognitive\nsuccess can be obstructed, and so a different understanding of the\nrange in which agents may be harmed, and sometimes even wronged, by\nsuch obstructions. For instance, on the contractualist view, epistemic\nharms may be built into the terms of the \u201ccontract\u201d. That\nis to say, such harms may be done not merely by the specific ways in\nwhich we interpret or implement our practice of epistemic appraisal,\nbut rather in the fundamental features of that practice itself. For\ninstance, a practice that grants the status of knowledge to a belief\nformed on the basis of clearly conceptualized sense perception, but\nnot to a belief formed on the basis of a less clearly conceptualized\nsense of a personal need, is a practice that systematically discredits\nbeliefs formed by exercises of empathy, relative to beliefs formed in\nother ordinary\n ways.[13]\n",
