    "main_text": "The Function of Morality\n2. The Function of Morality\n\nOne of the most widespread uses of game theory in ethics has been to\npostulate various functions of morality and to identify some\nof its important features. An early example of this is Edna\nUllmann-Margalit\u2019s The Emergence of Norms which argues\nthat morality can be understood as a system of norms that enable\nagents to coordinate their actions in order to achieve mutually\nadvantageous outcomes in situations where the pursuit of self-interest\nwould normally prevent this (Ullmann-Margalit 1977). The now classic\nexample she uses to illustrate this involves two soldiers who must\nchoose whether to man their mortars in order to stem the advance of\nthe enemy, or to flee. If both stay, it is certain that the\nenemy\u2019s advance will be halted, but the soldiers will almost\nsurely be injured. If both flee, the enemy will not only be able to\ntake the mountain pass, it will also be able to overtake and capture\nthe fleeing soldiers. And if just one of them stays while the other\nflees, the brave soldier will die trying to hold off the enemy, while\nthe other will have just enough time to escape to safety.\n\nThe scenario Ullmann-Margalit presents is an example of a\n prisoner\u2019s dilemma\n and is illustrated in\n Figure 1\n below. In this strategic form game, each soldier acts\nwithout observing the other\u2019s action. Each soldier has the\nchoice between the strategies of fleeing (F) or\nstaying (S). The cells in the matrix correspond to\nthe outcome of each possible pair of choices, with the numbers in the\ncells representing the utilities of the outcomes for the soldiers.\nSpecifically, higher numbers correspond to a more preferred outcome,\nand the first number represents the payoff of Soldier 1 who chooses\nbetween the actions corresponding to the rows, while the second number\nrepresents the payoff of Soldier 2 who chooses between the actions\ncorresponding to the columns.\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\nSoldier 2 \n\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\nS\nF  \n\n\nSoldier 1\nS\n(2,2)\n(0,3) \n\nF\n(3,0)\n(1,1)  \n\n\nS = stay, F = flee\n\nFigure 1. Ullmann-Margalit\u2019s\nMortarmen\u2019s Dilemma\n\n\nIn this situation each soldier has a reason to flee. This is because\nfleeing provides the only chance of escaping unharmed, which is the\noutcome each most prefers. However, the situation is a dilemma,\nbecause if each soldier pursues this course of action, then they will\nboth end up worse off than if neither had. Furthermore, the dilemma is\nmagnified by the fact that for each soldier, F is\nhis unique best response to any strategy the other soldier might\nchoose. That is, F is each soldier\u2019s\nstrictly dominant strategy, and \\((F,F)\\) is the unique\nNash equilibrium of this game even though both soldiers would\nfare better is they could somehow follow \\((S,S).\\)\n\nUllmann-Margalit pointed out that if the soldiers understood the\nnature of their predicament they might want to do something to prevent\nthemselves from both fleeing and subsequently being captured. More\nimportantly, she argued that the prisoner\u2019s dilemma that\ncharacterizes their predicament arises in innumerable interactions\nthat we find ourselves in every day. At first glance, the obvious\nsolution to these dilemmas might seem to be for the soldiers to simply\npledge to remain at their posts. The problem, however, is that in\nscenarios like this promises are unlikely to be credible, and, even\nwhen they are, they are prone to being exploited. Instead, what the\nsoldiers need is a way of literally or figuratively chaining\nthemselves to their mortars. Drawing on this observation,\nUllmann-Margalit\u2019s suggestion was that it is moral norms that do\nthis work. More specifically, it\u2019s not the promises to remain at\ntheir posts that solves the soldiers\u2019 predicament, so much as\ntheir commitment to keeping their promises and to sanctioning those\nwho don\u2019t.\n\nOne way of understanding views like this is that the function of\nmorality is to prevent failures of rationality. In the next section we\nwill discuss how game theory has been used to analyze the relationship\nbetween morality and prudential rationality. In the more recent\nliterature, though, there is growing consensus that the role norms of\nsocial morality play is not necessarily to constrain our instrumental\nreasoning so that we can overcome failures of prudential rationality,\nbut rather to transform mixed-motive games like the prisoner\u2019s\ndilemma into coordination problems where mutually advantageous\noutcomes are more stable and easier to arrive at. A classic example of\nthis approach is Bicchieri (2006). Like Ullmann-Margalit, Bicchieri\ncharacterizes norms in terms of our commitment to certain courses of\naction, and also emphasizes the importance of sanctions in this\ncontext. However, Bicchieri draws a distinction between social norms\nand other types of norm, and argues that what distinguishes the former\nfrom the latter is the conditional nature of our commitment to them.\nIn particular, compliance with social norms is grounded in both an\nindividual\u2019s (i) empirical expectation that a\nsufficiently large percentage of the population conforms to the norm,\nand (ii) her normative expectation that a sufficiently large\npercentage of the population expects others to conform to the norm.\nOnly when both of these expectations are satisfied will an individual\ncomply with a social norm. Because some individuals will be more\nsensitive to the expectations of others, or more inclined to want to\nsee a particular norm complied with, though, the relevant expectations\nmay vary between individuals. Only when expectations are satisfied for\na sufficiently large number of people, then, will the norm succeed in\ntransforming a social dilemma where mutually advantageous outcomes are\nunstable into a more easily solved coordination problem. And while it\nmight seem strange at first glance to suggest that norms we are only\nconditionally committed to are the lynchpin of social morality, given\nthe significant role social dilemmas play in preventing us from living\nwell together, this shouldn\u2019t be surprising. For a more thorough\ndiscussion of these issues see the entry on\n social norms.\n\nSo far our discussion has focused on how game theory has been used to\nillustrate some ostensible functions of morality and the role social\nnorms play in it. However, game theory has also been utilized to\nidentify particular norms that might be important, as well as to\nidentify important characteristics of norms. And, where the previous\nanalysis relied primarily on the tools of non-cooperative game theory,\nhere it is evolutionary game theory that has been especially\nilluminating. Particularly influential in this regard was the work of\nRobert Axelrod and colleagues in the early 1980s on the evolution of\ncooperation, along with the subsequent work of Robert Boyd, Peter\nRicherson, and various collaborators (see Axelrod 2006 and Boyd &\nRicherson 2005 for summaries of the relevant work). By analyzing the\nperformance of various fixed strategies in repeated social dilemmas\nthey were able to illustrate the important role that conditional\nstrategies and the willingness to sanction bad behavior play in\nallowing cooperation and other prosocial behaviors to not only emerge,\nbut become optimal from the standpoint of the individual. More\nspecifically, they showed that in environments where individuals have\na long-run interest in bringing about mutually advantageous outcomes\nbut a short-term interest in exploiting others for maximum gain, it is\nessential that (i) individuals not leave themselves vulnerable to\nrepeated exploitation, and (ii) at least some individuals be willing\nto punish exploitative behavior.\n\nFor Axelrod, who studied these issues primarily in the context of\nrepeated prisoner\u2019s dilemmas, the two requirements identified\nabove amount to the same thing. A strategy of unconditional\ncooperation allows an individual to be repeatedly taken advantage of.\nTo prevent this she should only cooperate with those who are similarly\nwilling to cooperate. More precisely, she should be nice\n(that is she should initially be willing to cooperate with anyone),\nbut she should also be provocable (that is she should be\nprepared to stop cooperating with anyone who takes advantage of her,\nat least for some amount of time). And, because sustained cooperation\nis in everybody\u2019s long-run interest, in this context withdrawing\nfuture cooperation as a consequence for being taken advantage of is a\nform of punishment.\n\nAs Boyd and Richerson showed, though, in many contexts it\u2019s not\nessential that everybody be willing to punish bad behavior. What is\nessential is that enough individuals are willing to do this.\nHowever, this generates a pair of puzzles. First, in many cases\nit\u2019s costly to police norms. In order to sustain cooperation,\nthen, groups often need some of their members to be prepared to engage\nin altruistic punishment. That is, some individuals need to\nbe willing to incur individual costs associated with punishment for\nthe benefit of others. Second, the willingness of some individuals to\npolice norms does not just allow the evolution of cooperation and\nother prosocial norms. Instead it potentially allows any norm to\nemerge and become stable. So, although we\u2019ve seen how game\ntheory can help explain why a disposition to comply with and police\ncertain norms may be important features of morality, important\nquestions remain concerning whether this is necessarily rational\nfrom the perspective of the individual. We\u2019ll turn to\nthose questions now. And in section 5 we\u2019ll return to the\nquestion of how to distinguish good from bad norms.\n",
