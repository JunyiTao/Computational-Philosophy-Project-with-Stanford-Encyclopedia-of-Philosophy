Since then, it has always\nbeen used to describe a special relationship of unity and mutual\nindebtedness within a group. The term\u2019s origins lie in French\nlegal usage, in which the Roman legal concept of an obligation in\nsolidum\u2014a joint contractual obligation in which each\nsignatory declared himself liable for the debts of all\ntogether\u2014long had a place in the French code civile\n(Blais 2007; Hayward 1959; Wildt 1999). Solidarity expands beyond its\nlegal origins to become a central social and political concept in\nresponse to anxiety about the centrifugal, individualizing forces of\ncommercial and industrial society. What could replace the old social\nties of church, family, and guild, all of which had been weakened by\nmarkets? What might ensure a sense of shared purpose and common good?\nAs an answer to these questions, \u201csolidarity\u201d becomes a\nrallying cry in progressive movements across Europe, including\nsocialism, liberal nationalism, Catholic reformism, and\nSolidarism.\n\nMore recently, there has been a resurgence not only in calls for\nsolidarity but also in theorizing about solidarity. Solidarity has\nbeen invoked with increasing regularity in contemporary social\nmovements (Movement for Black Lives, Occupy, MeToo, climate change\nactivism), law and politics (COVID, EU, constitutions around the\nworld, human rights), and even bioethics. There is a growing\nliterature in sociology, political science, social theory, and social\nand political philosophy on the concept and its value. And yet, the\nidea remains hard to pin down: What is solidarity? And what, if\nanything, makes it valuable? In this entry, we aim to provide an\noverview of this recent debate, focusing on its development in social\nand political philosophy.\n", "toc": [{"#NatuSoli": "1.

The Nature of Solidarity\n\nIn social and political philosophy, the concept of solidarity is\nprimarily used to evaluate, guide, and describe activities within\ngroups and between individuals and groups. In unpacking different\naccounts, it is useful to begin by listing some typical\npractice-embedded expressions in which the concept is used. In a\nconversation about our work environment, someone might say, \u201cwe\nshould show more solidarity with one another\u201d; in a conversation\nabout the origins of the welfare state, someone might say, \u201cthe\nwelfare state is an expression of solidarity among citizens\u201d; in\na conversation about the dynamics of social movements, someone might\nsay, \u201cthe neo-Nazi protesters acted in solidarity with one\nanother\u201d; in a conversation about supporting the Movement for\nBlack Lives (M4BL), someone might say, \u201cI stand in solidarity\nwith you in fighting oppression\u201d; in a conversation about the\nmoral values animating European integration as a project, someone\nmight say, \u201csolidarity is a foundational value of the European\nUnion\u201d; in a conversation about the downsides of investment\nbanking, someone might say, \u201cthere is not much solidarity among\nbankers\u201d; in a conversation about the plight of earthquake\nvictims in Indonesia, someone might say, \u201csolidarity requires\nthat we send some money as soon as possible\u201d; in responding to\nnews that a teammate has cancer, someone might say: \u201cwe ought to\nshave our heads in solidarity\u201d. What accounts of the concept can\naid us in evaluating and describing the phenomenon referred to in\nthese and similar circumstances?\n\nAt the broadest level, philosophers (such as O\u2019Neill 1996: 201\nand Miller 2017: 62) usually distinguish between two senses of\nsolidarity: solidarity among and solidarity with.\nAccording to the former, solidarity describes a relation among members\nof the same social group. As we will see in more detail below,\nsolidarity among usually requires a rough symmetry in the\nattitudes and dispositions of its members. For example, we might both\nidentify as members of Danish nation, share a commitment to overthrow\nthe occupiers, and each be willing to come to each other\u2019s aid\nin fighting them. On the other hand, solidarity with\ndescribes a relation between an individual and another individual, or\nbetween a set of individuals and the members of a social group of\nwhich the former are not members (the \u201coutgroup\u201d). On this\nreading, symmetry is not required: I might act in solidarity with you\nas an earthquake victim when I wire money to an NGO that is operative\nin your city. Here I act in solidarity with you without your acting in\nsolidarity with me (or even being disposed to act in solidarity with\nme were the tables to be turned). A paradigmatic example of\nsolidarity with is the Catholic notion of solidarity\nunderstood as a form of caritas, or charity (on an\nalternative interpretation of solidarity in the Catholic tradition,\nsee below). As J\u00f3zef Tischner, who was influential in\nPoland\u2019s solidarity movement, writes:\n\n\nWith whom, therefore, is our solidarity? It is, above all, with those\nwho have been wounded by other people, with those who suffer pain that\ncould be avoided\u2014accidental, needless pain. This does not\npreclude solidarity with others, with all who suffer. However, the\nsolidarity with those who suffer at the hands of others is\nparticularly vital, strong, spontaneous. (Tischner 1982 [1984]:\n8\u20139)\n\n\nPhilosophers divide on whether asymmetric, unilateral forms of aid and\nsupport from individuals to other individuals, or from outgroup\nmembers to ingroups counts as genuine solidarity. For some\n(see, e.g., Sangiovanni forthcoming), they do not. We do better, he\nargues, not to conceive of solidarity with as a form of\nsolidarity at all. The unilateral, asymmetric reading, he argues,\ntends to vitiate the egalitarianism at the heart of solidarity, and\ndoes not fit well with the practices in which the term was,\nhistorically, most prevalent. He also argues that solidarity\nwith in this narrower sense is not distinguishable from other,\nrelated terms, such as \u201chumanitarian aid\u201d,\n\u201ccharity\u201d, \u201cbenevolence\u201d, or \u201csupport\nfor a good cause\u201d. There is nothing gained in calling forms of\nhumanitarian aid or support for a good cause \u201csolidarity\u201d,\nand running the two ideas together under a single banner tends to\nobscure the value of solidarity as a form of egalitarian collective\naction.\n\nFor other philosophers (e.g., Kolers 2016), solidarity (whether\nwith or among) must always be unilateral\nand asymmetric. Kolers argues that paradigmatic cases of solidarity\ninvolve one group or individual (usually members of an outgroup),\nS, deferring to an object group, G, but not\nvice versa. According to Kolers,\n\n\n[solidary action] is not principally justified by appeal to goals, nor\ndo we choose sides on the basis of shared goals. To the contrary, when\nS is in solidarity with G, it is G, not\nG\u2019s ends, that S endorses or values. S is\ndisposed to adopt whatever goal G sets for the action\nor as a political aim. For instance, insofar as they are in\nsolidarity, heterosexual persons who support the right of same-sex\ncouples to marry do so not because they individually want same-sex\nmarriages to be possible, but because the LGBTQ community treats that\nas an important goal. (Kolers 2016: 58)\n\n\nParadigmatic instances of solidarity involve members of (out)groups\n(e.g., heterosexuals) committing themselves to do whatever members of\na disadvantaged (in)group (e.g., homosexuals) require to overcome\ninjustice. Importantly, on this picture outgroup members commit to the\ngroup, rather than to any aim pursued by the group. As a\nheterosexual, I do not act in solidarity by committing\ndirectly to fighting heterosexism alongside members of the LGBTQ\ncommunity; rather, to act in solidarity, I must commit to the LGBTQ\ncommunity as such, and so to whatever members tell me I need to do to\npromote their cause, whatever cause that is.\n\nOne advantage of this view is that it captures an important ethical\naspect of coalitional social movements in which more privileged\n(out)groups act as allies of less privileged (in)groups in fighting\ninjustice. As has often been noted, the trouble with such coalitions\nis that members of privileged groups often tend to be blind to the way\nin which privilege colors and sometimes distorts their efforts to\nsupport the aims of the\n movement.[1]\n Outgroup allies can sometimes reproduce, unconsciously, wider\nstructural patterns of power and exclusion as they fight alongside\ningroup members; they can perpetrate, for example, forms of epistemic\ninjustice in seeking to impose their own agenda or ideals onto the\nwider movement (Deveaux 2021; Clark 2014; Medina 2013; Gould 2020;\nLand 2015). Kolers\u2019 work reminds his readers that genuine\nsolidarity requires that members of outgroups put aside their\nparticular concerns, ideals, prejudices, and so on, and\nlisten (Kolers 2016: 115). They must be prepared, in turn, to\naccept their relative epistemic limitations vis-\u00e0-vis members\nof ingroups who not only have \u201cskin in the game\u201d but often\na vivid lived experience of the forms of injustice they are fighting.\nAnd they must also be prepared to defer out of respect for the\ndisadvantaged: whether or not the disadvantaged have better epistemic\naccess to truths about the struggle, etc., the privileged ought to\ndefer out of respect for what is at stake for the\n disadvantaged.[2]\n\nSo far, we have discussed unilateral, asymmetric accounts of our\ntarget concept. We now turn to accounts of the concept that treat the\nidea of solidarity among as paradigmatic. Rather than naming\nthe set of attitudes and actions characteristic of an individual who\n(unilaterally) offers support or aid, the idea of solidarity\namong names a relation among members of the\nsame group. The relation is generally understood to make it\nthe case that the group exhibits a distinctive kind of unity\namong its members (solidus in Latin means whole or\nintegrated). But what kind of unity? The unity in question is\ncomposed, on all plausible views, by an interlocking set of attitudes,\ndispositions, and characteristic actions displayed by members. It is\nuseful to compare relations of solidarity to the relations\nconstituting social groups as such. According to one\ninfluential definition of a social group, a social group \n\n\nis a collection of individuals who perceive themselves to be members\nof the same social category, share some emotional involvement in this\ncommon definition of themselves, and achieve some degree of social\nconsensus about the evaluation of their group and their membership of\nit. (Tajfel & Turner 2001: 100). \n\n\nPeople waiting at a bus stop, or boarding a train, are not, in normal\ncircumstances, a social group; employees of Google and members of the\nChurch of England are. We can then say: For an (in)group to display\nsolidarity, it must recognize itself as a social group: members must\nidentify themselves based on some characteristic that marks them out\nas a social group. For example, members might identify as\nworkers (on the basis, that is, of a role), as black\n(on the basis of racial\n categorization[3]),\n as cancer survivors (on the basis of a common set of\nexperiences), as environmentalists (on the basis of a shared\ncause), and so\n on.[4]\n But what other conditions are necessary (or at least paradigmatic)?\nIdentifying as a social group is not sufficient: it seems clear that\nwe might identify as employees of Google, or as engineers, or as\ninvestment bankers, but not be in solidarity with one another.\n\nAn obvious candidate is the condition that members of the social group\nbe disposed to put aside narrow self-interest in coming to each\nother\u2019s aid when required. We might imagine, for example, that\nthe employees of Google or investment bankers are not prepared to set\naside narrow self-interest except in special circumstances (where,\nsay, employees know one another independently). If this were true,\nthen it seems clear that, in their normal everyday interactions, they\nwouldn\u2019t be in solidarity with one another (despite their\ncooperation). Some philosophers believe that these two\nconditions\u2014identifying as a member of a social group and a\nwillingness, on that basis, to set aside narrow self-interest in\ncoming to a fellow\u2019s aid\u2014are necessary and\nsufficient for solidarity. Philippe Van Parijs, for example,\nwrites:\n\n\nWhen I help you out of solidarity, I do so because you are \u201cone\nof us\u201d, because \u201cI could have been you\u201d, because, in\nthis sense, I \u201cidentify\u201d with you. (Van Parijs\nforthcoming; see also Mason 2000: 27)\n\n\nTo illustrate, Van Parijs gives the example of a fellow traveler\nreturning a lost wallet, or a cyclist helping another to board a\ntrain. In both cases, someone identifies as a traveler (or as a\ncyclist) and, in virtue of that identification, is disposed to come to\nanother traveler or cyclist\u2019s aid.\n\nAn advantage of the view is that it can encompass a wide variety of\ndifferent contexts. It can, for example, account for\nunilateral senses of solidarity, such as the Good Samaritan.\nAs long as the Good Samaritan is motivated by a relevant\nself-categorization that includes the stranger, then his coming to his\naid counts as solidarity. The Good Samaritan might feel disposed to\naid because he has shared the experience of being a victim of\ninjustice, or because of their shared vulnerability, say, as human\nbeings. But its encompassing nature may also make it hard to\ndistinguish from related notions. The account seems to collapse into\nthe view that solidarity is another name for all responsibilities that\nflow (or that are perceived to flow) from membership in a social\ngroup.\n\nTommie Shelby offers a view that is broadly similar in structure, but\nstrengthens the requirements for mutual identification and group\ncohesion. For Shelby,\n\n\nI believe there are five core normative requirements that are jointly\nsufficient for a robust form of solidarity [identification with the\ngroup, special concern, shared values or goals, loyalty, and mutual\ntrust]. By \u201crobust\u201d I mean a solidarity that is strong\nenough to move people to collective action, not just mutual sympathy\nborn of recognition of communality or a mere sense of group belonging.\n(Shelby 2005: 68; see also May 1996: 44; cf. Feinberg 1973: 677)\n\n\nReturning a lost wallet and the Good Samaritan, on this view, are\nruled out since they are products of a weak sense of group belonging.\nOne may object, however, that the view is still not restrictive\nenough. For example, a reading group might exhibit all five features,\nand move its participants to do things together, and yet it seems\nstrained to say that a reading group is in solidarity with one\nanother. (It is strained not so much because it doesn\u2019t capture\nthe ordinary English meaning, but because it seems to jar with the\nvalue and history of the practices in which the term has predominantly\nfigured, and which make sense of the role we might want an account of\nsolidarity to play.) It is also unclear, on this view, whether\ncollective action is a necessary condition of solidarity, or whether\ntwo or more people can be in solidarity by holding the attitudes\nmentioned without ever acting together in some relevant sense. Might\nbrothers be in solidarity by possessing all five of the listed\nattitudes, though they never act together in the pursuit of any goals,\nor come to each other\u2019s aid in any way?\n\nSally Scholz offers a view of solidarity that is explicitly political\nand oppositional. For Scholz,\n\n\nPolitical solidarity arises in opposition to something; it is a\nmovement for social change that may occur at many levels of social\nexistence. \u2026 Natural disasters may inspire strong sentiments\nand even bonds of connection, but they do not inspire political\nsolidarity. Political solidarity as I present it has a social justice\ncontent or aim; it opposes injustice, oppression, tyranny, and social\nvulnerabilities. (Scholz 2008: 54; see also Mohanty 2003:\n 7)[5]\n\n\nSolidarity, on this view, is always geared toward overcoming\ninjustice; it is essentially political. The reading group would be\nexcluded, and so would be the Good Samaritan and sending money to\nearthquake victims. Scholz also argues that the concept entails the\nexistence of positive moral obligations among participants. If\nparticipants (for example, a white supremacist group) lack positive\nobligations to aid each other in protesting racial integration\n(because such a protest would be in the service of unjust ends), then\nthey cannot act in solidarity when they protest, come to each\nother\u2019s aid, and are committed to their cause.\n\nAndrea Sangiovanni offers a view that is less restrictive (but more\nrestrictive than Shelby\u2019s). In contrast to Scholz, he argues\nthat solidarity must always be aimed at overcoming adversity, but the\nadversity need not be political. For example, suppose a village burns\ndown in a fire and residents band together to rebuild it. They are\ncommitted to the endeavor and are ready to come to each other\u2019s\naid. Because their endeavor is oriented toward overcoming shared\nadversity it counts as solidarity. Furthermore, for Sangiovanni, the\nconcept solidarity is not moralized: even mafiosi can be in solidarity\nwith one another (despite the fact, that is, that their solidarity\nwill promote bad ends). Finally, solidarity, he claims, neither merely\nprecedes collective action (or, as Shelby argues, makes it\nmore likely) nor is it merely a by-product of collective\naction, but is itself a form of collective action. As a kind\nof action, it does not therefore name only a set of desires and\nbeliefs, a virtue, or a sense of fellowship with others. Rather,\nsolidarity is any instance of collective action that has the following\ncore features:\n\nParticipants identify with one another on the basis of a role,\ncondition, cause, set of experiences, or way of life on the basis of\nwhich \u2026\n\n\n\u2026 they each \u2026\n\n\u2026intend to do their part in overcoming some significant\nadversity, X, by pursuing, together, some more proximate shared\ngoal, Y;\n \u2026 are individually committed (i) to X and Y\nand (ii) to not bypassing each other\u2019s will in the achievement\nof X and Y;\n \u2026 are committed to sharing one another\u2019s fates in\nways relevant to X and Y.\n \u2026 trust one another to play their part in X and\nY, trust each other\u2019s commitment, trust that each will\nnot bypass the other\u2019s will, and trust each to share the\nother\u2019s fate.\n \n\n\nThis view faces a number of challenges as well. First, like Shelby and\nScholz, it doesn\u2019t allow for unilateral cases of\nsolidarity\u2014such as the Good Samaritan and sending money to\nearthquake victims\u2014to count as instances of solidarity since\nthere is no collective action in the required sense. Second, and\nrelatedly, it doesn\u2019t allow for cases of \u201csilent\u201d or\n\u201cprivate\u201d solidarity (Bommarito 2016; Zhao 2019). As a\nyoung girl, Simone Weil gave up eating sugar because sugar had become\nunavailable to soldiers at the front. It seems plausible to say that\nshe acted in solidarity with the soldiers. What reasons do we\nhave to rule such cases out? And, finally, it seems to rule out\nprotest movements that are organized on behalf of victims of\ninjustice but not with them. Imagine we organize a protest\nagainst the French government\u2019s closure of the refugee camps in\nCalais, and suppose that the refugees there do not know of, or\notherwise take part in, our protest. Sangiovanni\u2019s account seems\nto force us to say that we, on the outside, act in solidarity with one\nanother but not with the refugees.\n2. Solidarity in Practice\n\nSo far, we have discussed the nature of solidarity in general. In this\nsection, we review the social and political practices in which the\nterm has primarily figured. Whatever account of the general concept we\nthink is best should aid us in illuminating each of these contexts (by\nsuccessfully describing, evaluating, and guiding them). In the\nfollowing, however, we remain neutral between different accounts of\nthe general concept. Furthermore, we only cover a sample of such\ncontexts. There are many more practices in which solidarity has found\na place. We focus on what strike us as the historically most important\nand influential ones.\n2.1 Socialism\n\nAs mentioned above, the idea becomes prevalent in the early-nineteenth\ncentury in France. The soil in which the concept first takes root is\nsocialism. The early socialist writers\u2014Robert Owen\n(1771\u20131858), Henri de Saint-Simon (1760\u20131825), and Charles\nFourier (1772\u20131837) (who Marx and Engels would later dismiss as\n\u201cutopian\u201d) were especially influential\u2014decried the\nindividualism and egoism fostered by market society (Claeys 2011). The\nuntethering of markets from constraints of traditional law, social\nstructures, and morality inevitably led, they argued, to social\nconflict and the moral, economic, and cultural degradation of the\nworking classes. They believed that new forms of mutual aid,\ncooperation, and association were needed to bring each functional unit\nof the modern industrial economy together in a mutually supportive\nweb, and prevent the worst effects of the competitive division of\nlabor and the poverty it produces. In 1826, Robert Owen wrote:\n\n\nThere is but one mode \u2026 by which man can possess in perpetuity\nall the happiness which his nature is capable of enjoying,\u2014that\nis by the union and co-operation of all for the benefit of\neach. While mankind remain congregated in large cities and\ntowns, or live in single families apart from their species, each\nhaving distinct and opposite interests, no substantial improvement can\nbe effected in the condition of society. To obtain the full advantages\nof cooperation, men must be associated in small communities, or large\nfamilies, all the members of which shall be united by the bond of one\ncommon interest; the same bond of union connecting each community with\nevery other established on similar principles. (Owen 1826\u201327\n[2016: 69]; see also Leopold 2015)\n\n\nHippolyte Renaud gave this unified, mutually supportive social\ncooperation in the service of each and all a name that formed the\ntitle of his immensely popular summary of Fourier\u2019s works,\nnamely Solidarit\u00e9\n (1842).[6]\n\nIn \u201cSocialism: Utopian and Scientific\u201d (1876), Engels\nrejected the utopians\u2019 for failing to explain how their proposed\nsocieties could ever be realized (1876 [1978: 685ff]). There was no\nbasis for their doctrines or their faith in the empirically verifiable\nlaws of society. Given its association with the\n\u201cutopians\u201d, it is revealing that neither Marx nor Engels\never used \u201csolidarity\u201d as a term in any of their\nsystematic writings. Where they did use the term was in their speeches\nand letters regarding the workingmen\u2019s associations that were\nspringing up everywhere in defense of socialism. In 1872, in a speech\ngiven in Amsterdam after a congress of the First International, Marx\nsays:\n\n\nCitizens, let us think of the basic principle of the International:\nSolidarity. Only when we have established this life-giving principle\non a sound basis among the numerous workers of all countries will we\nattain the great final goal which we have set ourselves. The\nrevolution must be carried out with solidarity; this is the great\nlesson of the French Commune, which fell because none of the other\ncenters\u2014Berlin, Madrid, etc.\u2014developed great revolutionary\nmovements comparable to the mighty uprising of the Paris proletariat.\n(Marx 1872 [1978: 522])\n\n\nAnd, as Karl Kautsky, one of the most influential Marxists in the late\nnineteenth century, writes in the Class Struggle, which was\nthe German Social Democratic Party\u2019s official commentary on the\nproposed Erfurt program of 1891:\n\n\nBut as soon as the workers discover that their interests are common,\nthat they are all opposed to the exploiter, it takes the form of great\norganizations and open battles against the exploiting class.\u2026\nAnd when [these elevating tendencies] have once wakened full\nclass-consciousness in any group of workers, the consciousness of\nsolidarity with all the members of the working-class, the\nconsciousness of the strength that is born of union; as soon as any\ngroup has recognized that it is essential to society and that it dare\nhope for better things in the future,\u2014then it is well nigh\nimpossible to shove that group back into the degenerate mass of beings\nwhose opposition to the system under which they suffer takes no other\nform than that of unreasoned hate. (Kautsky 1892: Ch. 5,\nSecs. 5\u20136; see also Wildt 1999)\n\n\nFrom its early socialist origins, \u201csolidarity\u201d found its\nnatural home as a term describing the unity of workers\u2019\nassociations\u2014a term describing, that is, their mutual\nidentification with one another as exploited, their mutual commitment\nto overthrowing capitalism through organized cooperation, and their\nwillingness to sacrifice for one another in the name of the cause.\n2.2 Civic Solidarity\n\nCivic solidarity refers to solidarity among citizens of modern states,\nand is often associated with the emergence and development of welfare\nstates. The term as used in this way first became popular in the\nlate-nineteenth century in France. The late-nineteenth century usages\nare outgrowths of earlier forms of socialism, but they develop the\nidea in directions that are less oppositional than the socialism that\nemerges as a political force in the wake of 1848. Two figures are\nassociated with its popularization during this period: L\u00e9on\nBourgeois and Emile Durkheim. We start with L\u00e9on Bourgeois\nsince his account was, at the time, more influential than\nDurkheim\u2019s.\n\nIn 1896, L\u00e9on Bourgeois\u2014prime minister of France from\n1895\u20136\u2014published what would become the programmatic\nmanifesto of the Solidarist movement, namely a pamphlet entitled\nSolidarit\u00e9 (Bourgeois 1902). The pamphlet begins by\nnoting that all complex organisms reproduce themselves through an\ninternal division of labor. Each organ has a different function; their\ninterdependence is organized in such a way as to ensure the\nbeing\u2019s self-preservation. Bourgeois calls this internal unity\nnatural solidarity. He then goes on to note that societies\nare organized in much the same way: the more complex a society is, the\nmore diverse and interdependent its internal division of labor. There\nare two differences. The first difference is that societies are made\nup of individuals possessed of reason and will, and so the laws of\nnature are not sufficient to ensure that the parts will coordinate to\nsustain and reproduce the life of the whole. The second difference\nfollows directly from the first. Because the coordination necessary to\nmaintain and reproduce a society depends on the reason and will of\nindividuals, the laws that govern that reproduction must also work via\nthose very same faculties. The laws governing social\nsolidarity are, therefore, necessarily moral.\n\nWhat mores ought to govern the division of labor and so,\nultimately, the distribution of the benefits and burdens of joint\nproduction (la r\u00e9partition des profits et des\ncharges)? Bourgeois writes that we must look for an answer at the\nmoral implications of the very reciprocal dependence that constitutes\nsociety in the first place. Once we do so, we will see that every\nindividual within the societal division of labor owes the vast\npreponderance of what they are able to obtain from that\nsociety\u2014for example, through their talents and abilities, or\nthrough the knowledge they acquire from that society\u2014to two\nsources. First, they owe a debt to past generations and, second, to\ncontemporaries who, in the present, reproduce and advance the\ninstitutions, knowledge, resources, and societal conventions from\nwhich they gain (almost) all that is theirs.\n\n\n[Because of man\u2019s dependence on the societal division of labor]\na necessary exchange of services exists between each and all. The free\ndevelopment of his faculties, of his activities, in short, of his very\nbeing, can only be realized, for each individual, as a result\nof the concurrent contributions of other men\u2019s faculties and\nactivities. This free development can, furthermore, only reach its\nfull extent as a result of the accumulated contributions of the\npast.\n\nThere is therefore a debt owed by each to all the rest, in virtue of\nthe contributions and services rendered by all to each. (Bourgeois\n1902: 137, translation by Sangiovanni)\n\n\nMoral solidarity requires, then, citizens to identify with\none another as jointly responsible for the social product, and to be\nprepared to discharge the social debt through common institutions\ndesigned to insure people against unemployment, sickness, and old age,\nto maintain jobs open to talents, and to support a public system of\neducation. Lack of moral solidarity, Bourgeois implies, will lead\ninevitably to lack of coordination among the parts, and so to a\nbreakdown in natural solidarity.\n\nPublished a few years earlier than Bourgeois\u2019 pamphlet,\nDurkheim\u2019s doctoral thesis\u2014The Division of Labor in\nSociety (1893)\u2014distinguished between the\nmechanical solidarity typical of premodern, less complex\nsocieties and the organic solidarity of modern industrialized\nsocieties. Societies whose social cohesion is founded on mechanical\nsolidarity are integrated through a \u201ccollective\nconsciousness\u201d that defines a common way of life. Where\nmechanical solidarity is characterized by similarity among\nmembers of a society, organic solidarity is characterized by\ndifference. At the heart of organic solidarity is, as it was\nfor Bourgeois, the division of labor. Modern societies must be\nintegrated via the coordinated interdependence of an extensive\ndivision of labor. But Durkheim is adamant that the coordinated\nfunctioning of the different parts is not self-regulating. He\nemphasizes the need for a diffuse moral solidarity to\nreinforce and stabilize the functioning of the division of labor.\n(Top-down regulation via the state\u2014which is \u201ctoo\nremote\u201d and \u201cgeneral\u201d\u2014is also not enough\n[Durkheim 1893 [1984: 27]].) This solidarity can no longer come from\nthe \u201ccollective consciousness\u201d (as it did in premodern\nsocieties): the differentiation of modern society increases\nindividualism and diversity, undoing the bonds of similarity that tie\ntogether premodern societies. What sources are left to support the\nmutual \u201cattraction\u201d, disposition to come to other\u2019s\naid, and trust required for the cohesion of a society?\n\nHis proposed solution is clearest in the Second Preface to the\nDivision of Labor, added in 1902. He suggests that the state\nalone cannot guarantee the conditions necessary for maintaining\nsolidarity against the three predominant causes of social unrest in\nmodern, differentiated societies. The first cause is anomie,\nthe loss of direction and orientation that can accompany\nspecialization. Anomie is the primary social danger accompanying the\ngrowing depth and extent of the division of labor, and threatens the\nsense in which we each are essential contributors to the success of\nsociety as a whole (Durkheim 1893/1902 [1984: 289\u201390]). The\nsecond cause is force, the sense of injustice that arises\nfrom a feeling that one\u2019s work is not valued according to its\nworth and one\u2019s own merits\u2014the sense, in short, that one\nis exploited. Such grievances are especially strong when premodern\nelements of caste persist in modern conditions. The third cause is\ndisuse, or the aimlessness, resentment, and lack of focus\nthat comes from not having enough work. In each case, Durkheim argues,\nthe citizen comes to lose a grip on his larger place in reproducing\nthe whole; as he turns inwards, his grievances seem to him larger and\nhis duties to others less pressing; he is less fulfilled by his labor,\nseeing it no longer as a reflection of his nature; mistrust takes\nroot; he no longer sees his potential employers as cooperative\npartners, but begins to see them as enemies.\n\nIn the Preface, he argues that only the \u201cprofessional grouping\nis a moral force capable of curbing individual egoism\u201d (Durkheim\n1893/1902 [1984: 11]). By \u201cprofessional grouping\u201d,\nDurkheim meant that the various industrial branches of an economy\nwould be grouped into corporations (modelled on the feudal\ncorporation). Unlike unions, corporations would constituted by both\nemployers and employees, and would have the power to regulate wages,\nconditions of work, appointments and promotions; they would also have\nthe authority to coordinate with other branches and with government.\nThe effect of such groupings would be to recreate solidarity where it\nwas most under pressure:\n\n\nWithin a political society [e.g., a corporation], as soon as a certain\nnumber of individuals find they hold in common ideas, interests,\nsentiments and occupations which the rest of the population does not\nshare in, it is inevitable that, under the influence of these\nsimilarities, they should be attracted to one another. \u2026 It is\nimpossible for men to live together and be in regular contact with one\nanother without their acquiring some feeling for the totality which\nthey constitute through having united together, without their becoming\nattached to it, concerning themselves with its interests and taking it\ninto account in their behaviour. (Durkheim 1893/1902 [1984:\n17\u20138])\n\n\nThe idea was that, in grouping together in smaller, functionally\norganized units individuals would regain their sense of contributing\nto society while, at the same time, giving everyone a felt stake in\nthe justice and fairness required to reproduce it. In sum, organic\nsolidarity refers to the bonds of mutual sacrifice and attraction that\ndevelop when each citizen realizes how the contribution they make to\nthe overall functioning of the society as a whole, via their economic\nand social role, depends on a tightly knit, interdependent web of more\nparticular associations.\n2.3 National Solidarity\n\nThe nineteenth-century nationalist takes over the term from the\nsocialists to describe the unity of a nation in its struggle about\nexternal forces. For the nationalist, solidarity is anchored in shared\nidentification with an \u201cimagined community\u201d where\nmembership is defined not in terms of class or social position, but in\nterms of an underlying way of life characterized by common folkways,\nmores, and a shared history of struggle. In 1882, Ernest Renan claimed\nthat the nation is an expression of a \n\n\ngreat solidarity (une grande solidarit\u00e9), constituted\nby a sense of the common sacrifices that have been made and that one\nis disposed to make again. (Renan 1882: 29)\n\n\n\nAnd Giuseppe Mazzini, whose version of liberal-republican nationalism\nwas to have such a great influence on nationalist movements across the\nworld, writes in 1871:\n\n\nThe individual\u2019s means and his thirty or forty years of adult\nlife are but a tiny drop in the vast Ocean of existence. As soon as he\nbecomes aware of this, he ends up discouraged and abandons the entire\nundertaking. If he is a good man, he will now and again engage in\nsimple charity. If he is evil, he will isolate himself in complete\nselfishness. But give this man a Country [patria] and\nestablish a link of solidarity [solidariet\u00e0] between\nhis individual efforts and the efforts of all subsequent generations;\nplace him in association with the labors of 25 to 30 million men who\nspeak the same language, have similar habits and beliefs, profess\nfaith in the same goal, and have developed specific tools for\ntheir work as required by the general conditions of their land, and\nthe problem will change for him at once: his strengths will be greatly\nmultiplied, allowing him to feel up to the task. (\u201cNazionalismo\ne Nazionalit\u00e0\u201d 1871 [2009: 63])\n\n\nOn this understanding, the nation is understood primarily as a project\nin which each participates over time and across generations. This same\nunderstanding has carried over to contemporary nationalists. For\nthem,\n\na common history, territory, and shared bonds of belonging give rise\nto a commitment to a common project, namely to reproduce and defend\nthe patria. As in workers\u2019 movements, the struggle,\nfurthermore, requires a preparedness to come to each other\u2019s aid\nin realizing the project.\n2.4 Christian Solidarity\n\nSolidarity becomes increasingly important in Christian, especially\nCatholic, thought and practice beginning at the end of the nineteenth\ncentury and takes flight with the papacy of John Paul\n II.[7]\n In response to the rising importance of socialism and class conflict\nin the middle of the nineteenth century, the Church realizes the need\nto address the situation of the worker. In the Church\u2019s\nresponse, Pope Leo XIII\u2019s Rerum Novarum (1891)\u2014a\nstaple of Catholic social thought\u2014tries to steal a march on the\nsocialists by incorporating and reworking one of the socialist\u2019s\nmain rallying points, namely the idea of mutualism within\nworker\u2019s associations. In those passages, Leo cites Ecclesiastes\napprovingly on the importance of fraternity: \n\n\n\u201cIt is better that two should be together than one; for they\nhave the advantage of their society. If one fall he shall be supported\nby the other. Woe to him that is alone, for when he falleth he hath\nnone to lift him up\u201d. And further: \u201cA brother that is\nhelped by his brother is like a strong city\u201d. It is this natural\nimpulse which binds men together in civil society; and it is likewise\nthis which leads them to join together in associations. (Leo XIII\n1891: \u00a750)\n\n\nBut it was not until much later that the term gets used explicitly. In\nthe 1967 encyclical Populorum Progressio, on global\ndevelopment and the inequality between rich and poor nations, Pope\nPaul VI invokes the unmistakably Solidarist notion that\ninterdependence creates social obligations:\n\n\nWe are the heirs of earlier generations, and we reap benefits from the\nefforts of our contemporaries; we are under obligation to all men.\nTherefore we cannot disregard the welfare of those who will come after\nus to increase the human family. The reality of human solidarity\nbrings us not only benefits but also obligations. (\u00a717)\n\n\nThe origin of the Church\u2019s union of interdependence and\nsolidarity lies in an earlier nineteenth-century current of thought\noften referred to as Christian Solidarism. In Ethics and the\nNational Economy (1918), its founder and most prominent advocate,\nHeinrich Pesch (1854\u20131926), writes:\n\n\nChristianity teaches us that people, despite all individual and also\nsocial differences in occupation and ownership, are nevertheless\nsocii, i.e., comrades, precisely by virtue of those\ndifferences. They are dependent on each other and bound together by a\nsolidaristic community of interests in all of their\nindustrial relationships as masters and journeymen, as employers and\nworkers, and in the human race overall, which is the great universal\nfamily of nations. (Pesch 1918 [2004: 104])\n\n\nOn this corporatist understanding, it is not just the shared\nexperience of human suffering, or the understanding of the human being\nas imago dei, but a recognition of the interdependence of\nhuman beings in society that grounds a demand to share one\nanother\u2019s fate. On this picture, we are meant to recognize how\nboth our flourishing and our suffering is a result of mutual influence\nand mutual reliance in and through the multiple associations to which\nwe belong; in response, we have obligations to share others\u2019\nfates by coming to others\u2019 aid and by limiting the harm we\ndo.\n\nAs is widely recognized, John Paul II was also deeply influenced by\nthis strand of Catholic Social Thought (and its realization in Leo\nXIII\u2019s Rerum\n Novarum).[8]\n In Sollicitudo rei socialis, he writes:\n\n\nWhen interdependence becomes recognized [\u2026], the correlative\nresponse as a moral and social attitude, as a \u201cvirtue\u201d, is\nsolidarity. This then is not a feeling of vague compassion or shallow\ndistress at the misfortunes of so many people, both near and far. On\nthe contrary, it is a firm and persevering determination to commit\noneself to the common good; that is to say to the good of all and of\neach individual, because we are all really responsible for all. (John\nPaul II 1987: \u00a7V)\n\n\nOn this reading, the ground of solidarity is, as in Bourgeois and\nDurkheim, an identification based on our role in the division of\nlabor, which includes a recognition that participation in an\nunjust social order perpetuates suffering, and makes us accomplices.\nThe doctrine goes hand in hand with the Church\u2019s teaching on\nsubsidiarity, in which local associations\u2014including perhaps most\nimportantly the family\u2014have ethical priority to more general,\nencompassing associations, such as the state. More general and\nencompassing organizing units should intervene in the affairs of the\nlower only to help or aid them in the accomplishment of their tasks.\nOn this understanding, the response to individual suffering must be\ncollective; it cannot be done by individuals acting alone, but by each\nbody, at each level of generality, working together as a unit to\npreserve the common good. As Pope Francis noted in a follow-up\ncatechism to his COVID19 encyclical Fratelli Tutti, \n\n\nthere is no true solidarity without social participation, without the\ncontribution of intermediary bodies: families, associations,\ncooperatives, small businesses, and other expressions of society.\nEveryone needs to contribute, everyone. (Francis\n 2020)[9]\n\n2.5 Solidarity in social movements\n\nIn the late twentieth century, the predominant context in which\nsolidarity has had a place are modern social movements, such as\nanticolonial, black, feminist, LGBTQ, and disabled struggles. It would\ntake us too far afield to review how solidarity is deployed in each\none of these movements. But it useful to give a sense of the kind of\nquestions that have motivated those engaged in them. One of the\ncentral questions is the following: What should the basis of\nthe black, anticolonial, women\u2019s movements, and so on, be?\nShould, for example, the women\u2019s movement be grounded in an idea\nof sisterhood\u2014on what unites women as women\u2014or on\na commitment to the (feminist) cause (or both, or neither)? Should\nblack solidarity (for example in the US) be based in a shared\nethnocultural identity as a nation, or in common subjection to\noppression (or both, or neither)? Should Indigenous anti-colonial\nmovements in Canada be grounded in particular territorially-based\nshared ways of life, or in broader commitments to overthrowing\nEuropean colonialism wherever it exists (or both, or neither)? (see,\ne.g., Coulthard 2014; Simpson 2017). To give a sense of the debates,\nwe will focus on black solidarity and the idea of sisterhood.\n\nShould solidarity among women as women be grounded in some\nkind of shared experience of womanhood? It has become a staple of the\nfeminist literature that there is no shared experience of\nsimply being a woman. The attempt to identify a canonical list of\nexperiences that characterizes \u201cbeing a woman\u201d is likely\nto lead to subtle forms of exclusion. Previous such attempts, it is\noften argued, have reproduced the cis-gendered experiences of white,\nmiddle-class women, and have marginalized the experiences of women\nwhose experiences do not fit on the list (Lorde 1984; Hill Collins\n1990 [2000]; hooks 2000 [2015]; Combahee River Collective 1977/1983;\nSpelman 1988). See also entry on\n feminist perspectives on sex and gender.\n\nThe alternative to grounding sisterhood in shared experience or shared\noppression is to ground it in commitment to a cause or\ncoalition against patriarchy. The trouble with this view is\nthat it leaves open the question of how this defines a distinctive\nform of sisterhood, rather than a form of feminist\nsolidarity. But is there anything distinctive about solidarity among\nwomen as women? If so, what are its grounds?\n\nOne response is to ground sisterhood not in a shared\nexperience but in a shared condition of\noppression\u2014where that condition is experienced in different ways\naccording to one\u2019s overall structural position (which may be\nfurther influenced by intersecting factors, such as race, class,\nsexuality, and religion) (see, e.g., Young 1994).\n\nThis possible response to the challenge from exclusion invites a\nfurther objection: if sisterhood is supposed to be grounded in a\nshared condition defined by relations to a given set of socially\nconditioned material objects (primarily the socially sexed body and\nits reproductive functions), then doesn\u2019t this also exclude? If\nthis is supposed to ground an identification among women as women,\nthen doesn\u2019t sisterhood required constructing a shared narrative\nregarding what these relations are how they condition the sexed body?\n(Shrage 2009) But then doesn\u2019t this just reinvite the challenge\nfrom exclusion, since different women\u2014depending on their\nstructural position\u2014will find themselves subordinated and\noppressed by a different conglomeration of socially salient relations\nand practices? Think, for example, of transgender women, or the\nvariety of ways in which race, sexuality, class, gender, and religion\n intersect.[10]\n\n\nSimilar questions arise when considering the nature of Black\n(American) solidarity. Should such solidarity be grounded in a shared\nethnocultural identity, in a shared condition as oppressed, in an\nanti-racist cause as such, or in something else again (such as a\nshared fate)? (These grounds are not, of course, exclusive: one might\nbelieve that black solidarity should be grounded in both\nethnocultural identity and in the sense of sharing a distinct\ncondition of oppression.) An important strand of black\nnationalism\u2014one that was especially prominent in the1960s and\n70s\u2014holds that high-sounding appeals to the possibility of\nintegration in the name of a universal fight against injustice cannot\nground a robust solidarity among blacks. A deeper, widespread\nengagement with a distinct culture is needed. According to this form\nof nationalism, Black Americans (as descendants of slaves violently\nabducted from Africa and elsewhere) constitute a distinct, and\ndistinctly cultural, nation-within-a-nation (Robinson 2001; Moses\n1978). Nationalists argue that, though at the moment marginalized and\ndivided within itself, black culture calls for development and\nexpression (for example, in the arts, music, literature, and theatre)\n(Cruse 1967); without it, and the sense of collective identity and\npride it secures, blacks cannot securely win their freedom in a\nfundamentally hostile American society (see, e.g., Malcolm X 1970\n[1992]; cf. Rivers 1995).\n\nMany black liberals demur: while black cultural, economic, social,\ncultural and political autonomy can be, in certain circumstances,\nstrategically useful in the fight against anti-black racism, it is\nwrong-headed to insist on cultural unity as the basis of black\nsolidarity. Insisting on cultural unity is divisive and unnecessarily\nexclusionary given the broad diversity of ethnic and social\nbackgrounds in the black community. Black solidarity should be\ngrounded, instead, on \u201cthin\u201d blackness, namely on shared\nexperiences of anti-black racism (see, e.g., Shelby 2005: 245; Hill\nCollins 1990 [2000]; cf. Gooding-Williams 2009).\n2.6 Conclusion\n\nIn this section, we have reviewed some of the salient histories in\nwhich use of the term \u201csolidarity\u201d has figured. The survey\nhas had two functions. First, it has served to provide an overview of\nthe political and social uses for which solidarity has been enlisted.\nDoing so enables us to frame the descriptive and normative challenges\nthat any theory of solidarity faces: Does solidarity have a single\nnature that is repeated across different paradigmatic instances? Or is\nit a malleable, vague term with no fixed content? What, if anything,\nmakes solidarity valuable? What should the grounds of solidarity be\nin, for example, different social movements, in the welfare state, or\nin political and social associations more broadly? Second, the survey\nprovides a testing ground for new theories of solidarity, which, we\nhave argued, should be responsive to the concept\u2019s history.\nTheories should be adopted and rejected according to whether they\nsuccessfully serve to describe, evaluate, and guide the various\npractices in which the term figures, and has figured. While a theory\nmight recommend conceptual change, of course, it needs to be clear why\nand how such a change is worth making. Either way, being aware of the\nconcept\u2019s history is crucial since solidarity names not just an\nideal but a concrete set of practices.\n3. The Value of Solidarity\n\nIt should be fairly uncontroversial that solidarity can have\ninstrumental value: when members of a marginalized group\ndevelop bonds of solidarity by committing to each other and, as a\nresult of being in (or acting from) solidarity, they manage to\novercome their oppression, then solidarity has value because of its\ncausal/instrumental role. Similarly, it should not be controversial\nthat solidarity can have instrumental disvalue: even well-meaning,\nmorally justified acts undertaken in the spirit of solidarity can lead\nto unforeseen and regrettable consequences. The more interesting and\nchallenging question is whether solidarity, as a social practice, also\nhas non-instrumental value (or disvalue). But before we move on to\nthis issue, let\u2019s briefly list some of the instrumental values\nthat solidarity in different forms typically facilitates:\n\nMost notably, solidarity improves a collective\u2019s ability to\npursue projects. By committing to each other and experiencing unity,\nfellows in solidarity establish a robust basis of mutual\nidentification that allows them to solve coordination issues and\npursue joint action that is more likely to succeed than if each acted\non their own (Shelby 2005). Groups that display solidarity also tend\nto care for each other in beneficial ways, e.g., by protecting\nvulnerable members or limiting social inequality amongst themselves\n(Banting & Kymlicka 2017; Miller 2017). Beyond this, solidarity\nhas certain epistemic and relational benefits: whether as a result of\nshared goals, shared experience, or shared oppression (see above),\nfellows in solidarity consider each other trustworthy participants in\nthe pursuit of the common good, and they share information, jointly\ndeliberate and learn from each other about how to understand adversity\nand oppression and pursue strategies to overcome it (Harvey 2007 on\nepistemic solidarity; Goodin & Spiekermann 2015; Wiland 2017).\n\n\nDoes solidarity have value beyond these good consequences? Perhaps\nsome quick terminology is helpful. Non-instrumental value is value\nthat does not derive from making a contribution to something else.\nNon-instrumental value is intrinsic if the value stems from\nsome (necessary?) internal property of the object (see: Intrinsic\nvs. Extrinsic Value). Implicitly relying on such a notion of\nintrinsic non-instrumental value, several authors have claimed that\nsolidarity\u2019s value could only ever be instrumental. Rainer\nForst, for example, argues that solidarity could not be\n\u201csomething intrinsically good, since a Mafia family\nvery much depends on the solidarity of its members\u201d\n(forthcoming) and he concludes that, therefore, solidarity is\n\u201cnormatively dependent\u201d. Other authors concur with this\njudgment: solidarity is aimed at realizing justice or\novercoming oppression, and it is valuable when and because it realizes\nthis aim (Kohn forthcoming). The structure of the negative argument\nhere is clear enough:\n\n If solidarity has non-instrumental value, then each\ninstance of it has value\n Unity amongst mafia members is an instance of\nsolidarity\n Unity amongst mafia members has no value\n Therefore, solidarity has no non-instrumental\nvalue.\n Therefore, no internal property of solidarity\npractices that is valuable as such, independent of the consequences\nthat it produces\n\n\nThere is, however, an interesting overlap here with an issue we\nmentioned in\n section 2,\n namely whether or not solidarity ought to be moralized: according to\nsome authors that analyze such \u201cpernicious solidarities\u201d\nas the one that prevails amongst mafia clans and white supremacists,\nthe correct response to Forst\u2019s case is not to reject\nthat the idea that solidarity has non-instrumental value, but to deny\n premise (2):\n it is precisely for the reason that solidarity necessarily has some\ngood-making internal properties that we should not consider unity\namongst mafia members an instance of it.\n\nIt is not obvious how to resolve this potential disagreement. Is there\nperhaps some other way to proceed? A better approach, we think, is\navailable if we scrutinize\n premise (1):\n Intrinsic value is just one way in which a practice could have\nnon-instrumental value. Whilst it may be true that a practice only has\nintrinsic value if each instance of it has value, this is compatible\nwith its being non-instrumentally valuable in non-intrinsic ways. Here\nare some important considerations: Only attributing instrumental value\nto solidarity does, intuitively, seem to run up against at least two\nkinds of cases. First, defenders of the non-instrumental value of\nsolidarity may point to the intuitive force of \u201cfutile\nsolidarity\u201d: when the exploited workers come together to fight\nfor their rights in solidarity, we are likely to consider this\nvaluable even if their effort is ultimately thwarted. Second,\nthere is the very plausible thought that, somehow, a special kind of\nvalue is realized when bad or unjust aspects of the world are brought\nto an end through acts of solidarity: when the workers\u2019 combined\nagency causes the end of their oppression rather than, say, the\nunexpected change of mind of their exploitative bosses, something\nespecially valuable has occurred.\n\nNow of course there are things that defenders of the\n\u201cinstrumental only\u201d thesis can say in response: for\nexample, they may point out that there still are good consequences in\neach of these examples, even if the overall goal has not been\nrealized. For example, there may be a sense of shared destiny or\nreciprocal commitment amongst workers to each other that is\ncaused by solidarity. It is this reciprocal commitment (and\nwhat it can lead to) that has value, not solidarity as such. The\nproblem with this response is that it seems to misdescribe the\nrelation between solidarity and whatever good has occurred in the\nworld. The reciprocal commitment that workers have towards each other,\nfor example, is not \u201ccaused\u201d by solidarity: rather,\nsolidarity is partly or wholly constituted by it. One\nsuggestion, then, is that solidarity has non-instrumental value of a\nnon-intrinsic kind. What does this mean? The idea is that solidarity\nis part-constitutive of something that is non-instrumentally valuable.\nThis allows for there to be some practice x that satisfies our\ncriteria for being solidaristic, and yet, it does not have value. But\nit preserves the idea that solidarity is not only good for what it\ncauses but, if the right circumstances obtain, it is an integral\nelement in something that is intrinsically good.\n\nThere are at least two ways in which we might flesh out\nsolidarity\u2019s non-instrumental value, one more individualistic\nand one more collective. The more individualistic approach suggests\nthat we can understand solidarity\u2019s non-instrumental value as\nanalogous to the value of other good dispositions and attitudes that\nan agent can have. Specifically, philosophers thinking about the\ngoodness of virtue have argued that appropriately responding to\nsomething that has value is itself something of (intrinsic) value, as\nis negatively responding to something that has disvalue (Hurka 2001).\nThe connection to virtue works as follows: when an agent responds to\nthe adversity that they or others face by developing solidaristic\nattitudes and dispositions\u2014say by committing to ending\noppression with others picked out by the cause\u2014then their having\nthese solidarist attitudes is non-instrumentally valuable because they\nare negatively reacting to something that is of disvalue (oppression,\nadversity etc.). But, and here is the rub, the agent\u2019s response\nis only valuable when it constitutes the correct\nresponse to the relevant feature of the world. The white\nsupremacist\u2019s solidarity is not valuable because the thing\nagainst which his solidarity is directed, namely racial equality, is a\nvaluable state of affairs. But negatively responding to something that\nhas value clearly lacks non-instrumental value. This individualist\naccount of solidarity\u2019s non-instrumental value is attractive\nbecause it can account equally well for cases of \u201csolidarity\namongst\u201d and \u201csolidarity with\u201d. Moreover, it equally\napplies to cases where agents privately develop the relevant\nsolidaristic attitudes without actually acting on them (e.g.,\ndiscussed in Bommarito 2016; Zhao 2019; and Viehoff forthcoming).\nInsofar as we think that their attitudes are valuable, some account\nalong these lines seems necessary to account for it.\n\nBut perhaps there is something missing from this individualistic\npicture: one of the objections to those suggesting that solidarity\nonly has instrumental value relied on the idea that there is value in\npeople realizing a goal together. Shouldn\u2019t our account\nof solidarity\u2019s non-instrumental value also be able to capture\nthis aspect? Recent literature has accounted for this in broadly two\nways (though these are not necessarily exclusive): Avery Kolers\nmaintains that, quite independently of pursuing justified aims,\nsolidarity groups constitute just (in his words\n\u201cequitable\u201d) relations amongst participants. For Kolers,\nin following the demands of solidarity and acting together, \n\n\nwe are not only working to (teleologically) bring about the end of\noppression; rather, we constitutively embody a non-oppressive\nalternative world\u2014even if, as is likely, our joint efforts\nultimately fail, in part or in whole. (Kolers 2016: 123\u20134) \n\n\nSo one way of highlighting non-instrumental collective value ensues\nfrom focusing on the kind of community that relations of solidarity\ngive rise to: in acting together in the specific way required by the\nideal of solidarity, fellows already conform to norms of equity or\njustice that they seek to bring about more widely.\n\nAnother line of argument is developed by Sangiovanni, who argues that,\nwhen successfully pursuing valuable goals together, we create\nnon-instrumentally valuable joint agency: \n\n\nWe take pleasure in the exercise of those reciprocal, mutually\nadjusted, and mutually reinforcing capabilities that have enabled us\nto overcome forms of adversity that would have been impossible to\novercome alone. The collective activity of overcoming [\u2026] comes\nto have non-instrumental value. (Sangiovanni forthcoming) \n\n\nHowever, and similar to the more individualistic argument, the value\nof jointly exercised agency is conditional: acting\nsuccessfully to overcome some obstacle is non-instrumentally valuable\nonly if the overcoming constitutes an achievement that is\nworthwhile.\n4. Challenges to Solidarity\n\nTurning to criticisms of solidarity in this section, we start by\ndistinguishing different kinds of criticism along different\ndimensions. Perhaps most importantly, one must distinguish between, on\nthe one hand, challenges to solidarity as a social practice (or a\nrange of social practices), and, on the other hand, criticism of\ntheories of solidarity. We will call criticisms of the former kind\n\u201cpractical challenges\u201d to solidarity and will address\nthose of the latter kind as \u201ctheoretical challenges\u201d.\nPractical and theoretical challenges are clearly independent of each\nother. For example, one can think that we need a clear account of what\nsolidarity is, even if one holds that solidarity practices have, on\nthe whole, negative consequences for political life.\n\nTheoretical challenges to solidarity can conceivably take\nmany forms, but we will focus here on the related charges of\nconceptual incoherence and theoretical redundancy.\nThe former challenge is that uses of solidarity, both common sense and\nphilosophical, are simply too diffuse and incoherent to allow for any\nadequate and theoretically productive definition. If those using the\nconcept of solidarity in political or philosophical debate are more\nlikely than not to misunderstand or speak past each other, then we\nshould not use the concept. The latter challenge is that, from a\ntheoretical standpoint, we don\u2019t need to add solidarity to the\nfundamental philosophical concepts in the discipline because we can\nhave everything we want by reflecting on alternative concepts and\ntheories that have already been more thoroughly developed, for example\njustice, community, or equality.\n\nWhen it comes to practical challenges to solidarity, critics\nargue that solidarity tends to have negative consequences and that,\ntherefore, we should not promote it. We can further differentiate\nthese practical challenges in terms of, first, the kind of negative\nconsequences that are attributed to solidarity and, second, the kind\nof solidarity practices that are judged to be vulnerable to this\nchallenge. In relation to the former, the most prominent criticisms\nconcern solidarity\u2019s impact on the realization of other\nimportant social and political values. One historically important line\nof criticism to solidarity argues that solidarity threatens\nliberty (Arendt, Shklar, Kateb). Others worry that solidarity\ncreates unfair forms of inequality between those within a solidary\ngroup and those who are excluded (Scheffler 2001). Whilst the\ncriticism focus on negative effects on outsiders, critics have also\nargued that solidarity may have negative effects on participants.\nPerhaps most notably, some have claimed that solidarity stymies\npluralism and diversity. A related but distinct\nworry is that solidarity promotes\u2014or perhaps even\nrequires\u2014false beliefs and self-conceptions amongst participants\n(Margalit 2017; Shelby forthcoming).\n\nBefore we move on to specific arguments, a point about generality: We\nmaintain that, for a criticism to amount to a \u201cchallenge\u201d\nto solidarity, it must rise to a certain level of generality, i.e., it\nmust apply to a range of accounts of solidarity.\n4.1 Theoretical criticism of solidarity\n\nSince we are here interested in theoretical challenges to\nsolidarity (and not just objections to particular accounts),\nwe focus on challenges that, if true, would undermine the very\nendeavor of elevating solidarity\u2019s place amongst significant\ntheoretical concepts in the discipline.\n4.1.1 Conceptual incoherence\n\nA first theoretical worry about solidarity is that, given the\ndiversity of linguistic usage, the range of contexts of application,\nand the breadth of phenomena addressed in the philosophical literature\nunder the label, solidarity is conceptually incoherent. How might this\nbe the case? To use a somewhat far-fetched example, imagine that we\nwere charged with developing an account of the descriptive features,\ngoodness or permissibility of all human activities that start with the\nletter \u201cL\u201d. Because the actions picked out by our category\nare simply too heterogeneous (there is nothing interesting that\nlaughing and lying, let alone loving and lynching have in common), any\ntheorizing would be pointless. Could it be the case that\n\u201csolidarity\u201d picks out a set of actions and practices that\nare simply too heterogeneous to lead to anything theoretically\ninsightful? Niklas Luhmann, for example, suggested that solidarity is\nobsolete, a mere \u201cformula of ideology\u201d without determinate\ncontent (Luhmann [1984] quoted in Thome 1999: 101).\n\nDespite the initial plausibility of this objection to theorizing\nsolidarity, we think that solidarity theorists have powerful responses\navailable. First, they can point to similarities that unify the\ndescriptive, normative and evaluative features of instantiations of\nsolidarity, even those as diverse as those mentioned above. For\nexample, different authors have sought to show that despite their\ninitial heterogeneity, solidarity in all these contexts descriptively\nentails a form of identification, or a sentiment of unity, or some\norientation towards overcoming an obstacle or adversity, or some\ncombination of these elements (Scholz 2008; Taylor 2015; Prainsack\n& Buyx 2017).  Moreover, authors have subcategorized solidarity\nalong social contexts\u2014political solidarity, civic\nsolidarity\u2014(Bayertz 1999a; Scholz 2008), thereby organizing our\nheterogeneous linguistic use to allow for useful theoretical\napproaches to more determinate social practices of\nsolidarity. Finally, theorists of solidarity can respond that, in\nproviding a theoretical/philosophical account of solidarity, there is\nsome freedom to make revisionary proposals about what should\ncount as solidarity. Our (descriptive, normative, evaluative)\nunderstanding of solidarity is advanced if we \u201csharpen\u201d\nour account of solidarity by excluding some peripheral uses, then that\nmay well be legitimate and will limit the charge of\nincoherence. Theorists of solidarity may also point to other social\nand political concepts to claim that heterogeneous use both in\neveryday discourse and among philosophers is rarely considered a\nconvincing reason to abstain from theorizing concepts like freedom,\nequality, justice, and the like. Why treat solidarity differently?\n4.1.2 Theoretical redundancy\n\nFaced with this appeal to other political concepts, critics may\nretreat to a related but distinct criticism: They may accept that\nconcepts like freedom and equality too are beset with complexity and\nconceptual disagreements that need to be resolved. But they can then\ninsist that there is no need to take up this difficult endeavor for\nsolidarity because\u2014contrary to liberty, equality\netc.\u2014there is no need for a theory of solidarity. This is the\ncharge of theoretical redundancy: we can gain exactly the\nsame explanatory mileage by using existing concepts and categories\nwithout theorizing solidarity. Descriptively, existing work\non altruism, community and relations of loyalty might serve us just as\nwell as accounts of solidarity: all of the relations that were\ndescribed as solidaristic above are also (more or less intimate)\ncommunal relations amongst people. Normatively, the critic\nmight suggest that we can reduce the claims generated by solidarity to\nrequirements of justice, fairness, equality, and the like. And\nevaluatively, we can appeal to the general goodness of\nspecial bonds and relationships for the realization of a flourishing\nlife, whether they are bonds of friendship, family, religion, or\npolitical community. If this were the case, then theorizing solidarity\nwould be redundant, and ultimately, pointless. Why not, in a spirit of\nparsimony, simply rely on the concepts and theories we already\nhave?\n\nAgain, we think that defenders of solidarity have good replies\navailable: Perhaps the strongest response to the challenge of\nredundancy is to provide a substantive account of solidarity in terms\nof its distinctive descriptive, normative and evaluative features. If\nsuch an account is illuminating, then the charge of redundancy seems\nbeside the point. More specifically, theorists of solidarity can\nappeal to distinctive descriptive or positive features of\nsolidarity practices that make it inappropriate to subsume solidarity\nunder a generic account of community and loyalty (see discussion in\nKolers 2016: chapter 2). Unlike those bonds of friendship and family,\nfor example, solidarity is purposive (goal-oriented), both in the\nsense that solidarity aims for the achievement of overcoming some\nobstacle or adversity and in the sense that fellows are picked de\ndicto in terms of the cause that is pursued rather than in some\ngoal-independent manner (Arnsperger & Varoufakis 2003; Kolers\n2016). In terms of normative distinctiveness, theorists of solidarity\nmay also object to the critic\u2019s implied assumption that a\ntheoretical account of x\u2019s normative properties loses its\nusefulness when we discover that these properties supervene on or are\nexplained by a more general moral consideration.\n4.2 Practical challenges to Solidarity\n\nWe now move on to the practical challenges of solidarity. Should we be\ncritical of real-world solidarity practices because they lead to bad\nconsequences? Or may there perhaps even be something constitutively\nproblematic about solidarity movements? Three prominent objections\nrelate to solidarity\u2019s impact on liberty, fairness, and\ntruth.\n4.2.1 Does solidarity threaten liberty?\n\nDoes solidarity muffle liberty? In her celebrated essay the\n\u201cLiberalism of Fear\u201d, Judith Shklar claims it does. She\nwrites:\n\n\nWe must therefore be suspicious of ideologies of solidarity, precisely\nbecause they are so attractive to those who find liberalism\nemotionally unsatisfying, and who have gone on in our century to\ncreate oppressive and cruel regimes of unparalleled horror. [\u2026]\nTo seek emotional and personal development in the bosom of a community\nor in romantic self-expression is a choice open to citizens in liberal\nsocieties. Both, however, are apolitical impulses and wholly\nself-oriented, which at best distract us from the main task of\npolitics when they are presented as political doctrines, and at worst\ncan, under unfortunate circumstances, seriously damage liberal\npractices. For although both appear only to be redrawing the\nboundaries between the personal and the public [\u2026] it cannot be\nsaid that either one has a serious sense of the implications of the\nproposed shifts in either direction. (Shklar 1989: 36)\n\n\nThere is, one might think, an element of truth here: theorists of\nsolidarity tend to emphasize that solidarity becomes important when\nand because we sense the need for collective resistance and unity of\npurpose in the face of adversity. They also stress the\nnon-instrumental value in setting aside self-interest in a horizontal\nidentification with others on behalf of a shared goal, where part of\nwhat is valued is our seeing, together, our collective agency\nreflected in the ends we pursue (see previous section).\n\nThe element of identification may seem particularly problematic.\nIdentification requires, among other things, coming to see others as\n\u201clike oneself\u201d, and taking that similarity as a basis for\njoint concern, empathy, and normative orientation. So, for example,\nwhen I identify with you as a worker, I see our common role\nas providing an important orientation in my life. In this sense,\nsolidarity demands that one set aside the personal for the political\n(thus \u201credrawing the boundaries\u201d between them). The worry\nis that, at least in politics, solidarity\u2019s demand for\nsimilarity, commitment, and loyalty leads to unfreedom and\n tyranny.[11]\n\n\nFaced with this fundamental challenge, theorists of solidarity have at\nleast two arguments: First, they may insist that it is false to treat\na commitment to solidarity as incompatible with a commitment to\nliberalism. To be sure, solidarities organized to promote illiberal\nends by illiberal means are, well, illiberal by definition. But their\ndisregard for individual rights or freedom or equality is not entailed\nor required by their solidarity. Indeed, if, as Shklar and others\nemphasize, liberalism demands vigilance, hatred of injustice, and a\nreadiness to resist power when necessary, then liberalism requires\nsolidarity. Resistance is most effective when it is conducted by\ngroups whose grievances are shared and known to be shared.\nThese grievances provide a spring for joint action, and a powerful\nsource of identification. Such identification is necessary to overcome\nfear, and it allows people to act pro-socially by looking beyond their\nimmediate self-interest to the larger task at hand.\n\nA second reason why these challenges are not fully convincing is this:\nIn Shklar the target is what we might call state-level\nsolidarity. Though they do not name it, their target is national or\npatriotic solidarity\u2014solidarity as invoked by those who have\npolitical power and who aim to rally the people against an enemy, or\nsolidarity as it is invoked by those who believe that active, partisan\npolitical participation is essential for a flourishing life. The first\nresponse is simply to point out (as this entry does) that solidarity\ncan be at the heart of social movements and bottom-up political\naction. It need not be solely focused on or through the state. The\nsecond response is that even state-level solidarity need not be so\npernicious. Civic solidarity need not enforce blind conformity,\ndisrespect difference or disagreement, or raze\n plurality.[12]\n There is a rich tradition in the history of political\nideas\u2014stretching from Leon\n Bourgeois\u2019[13]\n solidarism to present writings\u2014that grounds civic solidarity\nnot in some \u201ctotalizing\u201d pre-political identity, but in\nthe mutual interdependence of citizens and their democratic\nco-authorship of justice-preserving\n institutions.[14]\n\n4.2.2 Does solidarity promote false beliefs?\n\nSolidarity, it was said, imposes not only demands on what to do but\nalso on what fellows should believe. With regard to such beliefs,\nsolidarity requires fellows to see each other as united by some common\nfeature, or condition or experience. Does solidarity systematically\nlead to false beliefs amongst members of solidarity groups, for\nexample about what unites them?\n\nPerhaps most prominently, the question of the relationship\nbetween\u2014in this case, historical\u2014truth and the\nkind of collective group identification necessary for solidarity has\ncome up in debates about (liberal) nationalism. Here, the charge\nagainst nationalist solidarity is that, for essentially instrumental\npurposes, national identity both relies on and promotes false beliefs\namongst members about some glorified national past (Abizadeh 2004).\nOther forms of solidarity need not, of course, rely on some shared\nhistorical origins amongst participants. But the challenge can be\ngeneralized: insofar as solidarity requires some ground for mutual\nidentification, whether shared experience, shared oppression, or\nshared goals, there is a danger that the practice systematically\nguides participants to overestimate those identification-grounding\nfeatures at the expense of other, perhaps more salient, elements that\nare not shared amongst them. To go back to two earlier examples,\nsisterhood may require participants to see some feature of their\nidentity (\u201cbeing a woman\u201d) as particularly important when,\nin fact, their de facto situation of social disadvantage is (also)\nfundamentally structured by other categories like race or class.\nSimilarly, black solidarity asks participants to focus on whatever\ngrounds commonality amongst blacks, even if their actual social\nposition is shaped by matters of class, gender, migration status, and\nso on (Shelby forthcoming). \n\nConfronted with the fact that much of what is promulgated as part of\nshared national history does not hold up against the historical\nrecord, liberal nationalists like David Miller (1995) have responded\nthat \u201cmyths\u201d about a national collective\u2019s past need\nnot be true so long as they serve the purpose of supporting those\nattitudes that underpin valuable national solidarity. But irrespective\nof whether or not they are useful, they are untrue,\nand, to the extent that the group identification necessary for\nnational solidarity depends on it, it depends on having false\nbeliefs.\n\nDoes this worry generalize to all forms of solidarity? One important\ndifference between national solidarity and other forms is that most\nother solidarities do not typically depend on beliefs in something\nthat is manifestly untrue. Rather, they emphasize the relevance of\nsome genuine aspect of a person\u2019s practical\nidentity\u2014whether it is shared experience, shared oppression,\nshared goals etc.\u2014over others. We might add that whether or not\nsome feature is salient for one\u2019s practical identity\nis, at least to a degree, up to the relevant agent. So one\nconciliatory response that defenders of (non-national) solidarity\nmight offer is that solidarity does not depend on belief in\nfalsehoods, but rather that it expresses which aspects of their\nidentity participants take to be important. They might add that,\ninsofar as there is free deliberation both about what unites and,\nimportantly, what divides participants to solidarity movements, the\ncharge of promoting false beliefs is beside the point. In a more\ncombative vein, they may also add that, at least in some cases,\nsolidarity is actually a necessary element for the formation of\ncorrect beliefs about one\u2019s own and others\u2019 predicament.\nWiland describes this as epistemic solidarity (Wiland 2017:\n69). Thus, standing in solidarity with others that have suffered from\nsimilar instances of adversity and oppression can be a necessary\ncondition for enabling each other to make sense of our predicament: We\nform true beliefs about our shared predicament and improve our ability\nto define and fight oppressive conditions by being able to trust each\nother\u2019s oppression-related testimony (Goodin & Spiekermann\n2015).\n4.2.3 Is solidarity exclusionary / unfair towards outsiders?\n\nWhatever else solidarity entails descriptively; it entails a special\ncommitment to one\u2019s solidarity fellows that one does not hold\ntowards everybody else. And whatever normative consequences solidarity\nhas for those in solidarity, it will ground some special\nclaims that these fellows have on us and we on them. In this sense,\nsolidarity, like friendship, family, and nationality, constitutes a\nspecial relationship with special obligations. Over recent decades, a\nnumber of philosophers have raised challenges to the very idea that\nspecial obligations can be justified towards those who are not part of\nthem. Perhaps most prominently, Samuel Scheffler has raised a\nfairness-based \u201cdistributive objection\u201d to all special\nrelationships (Scheffler 2001). If fellows in solidarity form special\nrelationships with special obligations, then, does Scheffler\u2019s\ncriticism apply here too?\n\nThe distributive objection builds on the idea that participants to\nspecial relationships receive special benefits from each other: qua\nmembership, we are owed not just more from fellow participants than we\nare from outsiders, but we are also owed priority, in at least some\ninstances. What the distributive objection observes is that members\nalready benefit from the relationship goods that are constitutively\ntied to being in a meaningful relationship. The problem is that, then,\nfellows also owe less to outsiders then they did beforehand: Special\nrelationships\u2014including solidarity relations\u2014thus\nfunction, to use Scheffler\u2019s memorable phrase, like \u201cmoral\ntax shelters\u201d to those who already benefit.\n\nWhilst several authors have rejected the general thrust of the\ndistributive objection (Kolodny 2002; Lazar 2009), we want to point to\nsome features of solidarity that should provide specific cover against\nthis challenge. Crucially, friends of solidarity may stress that\nunlike friendship or love relations, solidarity obligations are not\nnecessarily grounded in the value of the relationship, but in\nrelationship-independent value that comes from having these duties.\nSpecial duties of solidarity would then be justified more like role\nobligations\u2014lawyers, for example, have fiduciary duties to\nrepresent their client\u2019s interests not because of the\nnon-instrumental value of lawyer-client relationships, but because of\nthe advantages that vesting them with such duties has for the\nsystem\u2019s overall ability to optimally realize impartial moral\ndemands (such as protecting innocent defendants). On this strategy,\nduties of solidarity would ultimately be grounded in non-partial\nvalues like fairness and natural justice. How might this justification\nrun? Many of our positive general duties are imperfect, so that even\nwell-meaning people are likely to face significant obstacles in\ndischarging them: it requires the ability to coordinate our actions in\ncomplex ways with others; and we must also be motivated to make\ncontributions in light of other important projects and relationships.\nIf the special obligations that flow from solidarity commitments can\nprovide us with a robust way of solving issues of coordination and\nmotivation (because, following a solidarity-commitment, discharging\nour general duties through solidarity somehow better aligns with our\npersonal projects) then those obligations could be justified by an\nappeal to impartial moral considerations (Kolers 2016; Viehoff\nforthcoming).\n\nBut even for those who think that some duties of solidarity\nare grounded in the non-instrumental value of solidaristic fellowship,\nthere are important responses available: First, solidarity (at least\nin its most paradigmatic forms) establishes unity amongst those\nsuffering from injustice or oppression, so it rather far from\nproviding some kind of indirect protection from more extensive duties\ntowards the more vulnerable. Second, special responsibilities towards\nour fellows, like other special duties, are not absolute: very\nplausibly, they are constrained by general demands of justice. So even\nif special obligations among fellows in solidarity could ground some\npartiality, these duties would be limited by more weighty\nconsiderations of justice.\n\nDo these responses answer all the possible objections of fairness and\nexclusion? Probably not; questions of permissible solidaristic\npartiality, especially amongst large-scale collectives like the state,\nclearly depend on questions of social and global justice that cannot\nbe addressed here. So questions of the kinds of obligations that\nsolidarity practices can ground blend into issues of justice. But that\nshould not be surprising, nor should it prevent us from reflection on\nsolidarity in its own right.\n", "bibliography": {"categories": [], "cat_ref_text": {"ref_list": ["Abizadeh, Arash, 2004, \u201cHistorical Truth, National Myths and\nLiberal Democracy: On the Coherence of Liberal Nationalism\u201d,\n<em>Journal of Political Philosophy</em>, 12(3): 291\u2013313.\ndoi:10.1111/j.1467-9760.2004.00201.x", "Appiah, Anthony, 1985, \u201cThe Uncompleted Argument: Du Bois\nand the Illusion of Race\u201d, <em>Critical Inquiry</em>, 12(1):\n21\u201337. doi:10.1086/448319", "Arendt, Hannah, 1963, <em>On Revolution</em>, New York: Viking\nPress.", "\u2013\u2013\u2013, 1951 [1973], <em>The Origins of\nTotalitarianism</em>, New York: Harcourt, Brace.
