This is epistemic modal logic. (See the entry on\n epistemic logic\n for background material.)\n\nThis approach has proved to be very useful. However, when\nepistemically possible worlds confirm to the rules of logically\npossible worlds, the following principle is valid:\n\n(Closure) If \\(KA\\) and \\(A\\) entails \\(B\\), then \\(KB\\)\n\nThis principle says that one knows all the logical consequences of the\nthings one knows. A special case of this principle says that all valid\nformulas are known:\n\n(Validity) If \\(A\\) is valid, then so is \\(KA\\)\n\nBut these principles seem false. You don\u2019t know all the logical\nand mathematical truths, and there are truths which follow from what\nyou know which you don\u2019t know. (You might be indifferent to\nthose truths; you might even disbelieve them.) This is the problem of\nlogical omniscience (see\n epistemic logic\n again). There is a rich literature on the problem (Alechina et al.\n2004, Duc 1997, Hintikka 1975, Jago 2014a,b, Rantala 1982a), including\nsome who defend these seemingly false principles (Stalnaker 1991,\n1999).\n\nExactly the same holds for belief (treated with a modality\n\u2018\\(B\\)\u2019 along the lines of \u2018\\(K\\)\u2019). The modal\nepistemic approach tells us that, as well as believing all\nconsequences of what we believe, we must hold a perfectly consistent\nset of beliefs:\n\n(Consistency) \\(\\vDash \\neg(BA \\wedge B\\neg A)\\).\n\nThis is a hard principle to defend, as anyone who has reflected on\ntheir own beliefs will appreciate.\n\nA popular method of avoiding these principles (beginning with\nCresswell 1973 and Hintikka 1975) is to allow impossible worlds into\nthe account. Consider again Rescher and Brandom\u2019s nonadjunctive\nand nonprime worlds, at which conjunction and disjunction behave\nanarchically. Rantala (1982a) takes the idea further, introducing\nworlds at which any connective may behave anarchically.\n\nRantala\u2019s approach divides the worlds into normal and\nnon-normal ones. Normal worlds behave like possible worlds\nwhereas at non-normal worlds, every sentence is assigned an\narbitrary truth value. In effect, complex sentences \\(\\neg A, A \\vee\nB\\), and so on, are treated as if they were atomic sentences. The\ntruth value of \\(\\neg A\\) is independent of \\(A\\); the value of \\(A\n\\vee B\\) is independent of the values of \\(A\\) and \\(B\\) at a\nnon-normal world; and so on for the other complex sentences. These\nnon-normal worlds are thus a very anarchic form of impossible world.\nPriest (2005, 2016) calls them open worlds, since they are\nnot closed under any rule of inference (other than the trivial rule\nallowing one to infer \\(A\\) from \\(A\\); see also Jago 2014a).\n\nLogical consequence and validity are defined with respect to possible\n(normal) worlds only. Impossible worlds come into play only when\nevaluating knowledge claims, \\(KA\\). So, ignoring \\(K\\)-sentences, the\nlogic is classical. But the logic of \\(K\\)-sentences is not closed\nunder any non-trivial rule of inference, thereby dispensing with\nClosure, Validity, and (in the case of belief) Consistency. An agent\nis modelled as having inconsistent beliefs, for example, simply by\ntreating an impossible world where both \\(A\\) and \\(\\neg A\\) are true\nas being epistemically accessible (from the actual world) for that\nagent.\n\nThe approach has been generalized to quantified modal logics (Rantala\n1982b) and developed into a unified framework for epistemic logics\n(Wansing 1989, 1990). Wansing has shown that various logics for\nknowledge and belief developed in Artificial Intelligence can find\nequivalent models in structures including impossible worlds. Further\nequivalence results in this area have been obtained in Sillari 2008,\nwhere it is shown that impossible worlds structures using binary\nepistemic accessibility relations are equivalent to structures using\nMontague-Scott neighborhood semantics.\n\nThis kind of approach faces problems, however. If there\u2019s no\nlogical structure to impossible worlds, then we might do as well to\nmodel an agent\u2019s knowledge using an arbitrary set of sentences,\nas in Konolige 1986. The worry is that unconstrained impossible worlds\nsemantics makes no real progress over this purely syntactic approach\n(Jago 2007, 2009).\n\nOne may instead adopt impossible worlds that retain some\nlogical structure, e.g., worlds closed under some\nweaker-than-classical logical consequence. One approach of this kind\nis found in Levesque 1984 (see also Cresswell 1973). This employs\nimpossible worlds of the kind used in paraconsistent relevant logics,\nwhich can be locally inconsistent and incomplete but are well-behaved\nwith respect to conjunction and disjunction, that is, they are\nadjunctive and prime. Laws of classical logic fail at them, and by\naccessing them a cognitive agent can have inconsistent beliefs.\nHowever, we still have a weakened form of logical omniscience: the\nbeliefs of an agent are closed under the weaker\nparaconsistent-relevant logic at issue. This seems incorrect as an\nattempt to model finite agents.\n\nRasmussen (2015) and Bjerring and Skipper (2019) present a\ndynamic impossible worlds solution to the logical omniscience\nproblem. Agents\u2019 beliefs evolve over time due to epistemic\nactions, on this approach (see the entry on\n dynamic epistemic logic\n for background). Bjerring and Skipper focus on deductive\nactions. Agents count as competent insofar as they unfold the\nconsequences of their beliefs, up to a certain depth of reasoning.\nTheir operator \u201c\\(\\langle n\\rangle KA\\)\u201d, says:\n\u201cAfter some \\(n\\)-step chain of logical reasoning, the agent\ncomes to know that \\(A\\)\u201d. The agent can update its epistemic\nstate by kicking out choices of impossible worlds which were epistemic\npossibilities before the deduction took place. One can show that if a\nformula \\(A\\) follows from formulas \\(A_1, \\ldots, A_n\\) in \\(n\\)\nsteps of reasoning, then \\(KA_1, \\ldots, KA_n\\) together entail\n\\(\\langle n\\rangle KA\\).\n\nImpossible worlds are starting to be used not only in formal, but also\nin mainstream and Bayesian epistemology. Modal accounts of knowledge\ninvoking possible worlds, whether based on the notion of\n safety\n or on that of\n sensitivity,\n make all necessary or logical truths trivially sensitive and safe.\nMelchior 2021 proposes to address the issue by using impossible\nworlds. Probabilistic-Bayesian accounts of credences or degrees of\nbelief can be formulated using logically possible worlds and sets\nthereof, to which probabilities are assigned by credence functions\nobeying the Kolmogorov axioms of probability. As noted by Pettigrew\n2021, this models logically omniscient, idealised agents who assign\nprobability 1 to all logical truths and never have higher credences in\nany given premises than in their logical consequences. To model\nrational but more realistic agents, Pettigrew introduces a setting\nsimilar to that Berto and Jago 2019 had for all-or-nothing beliefs. He\nresorts to \u201cpersonally possible worlds\u201d which make true\nwhat a rational but cognitively limited agent believes and has not\n(yet) ruled out using its bounded cognitive resources. Such worlds are\nin fact impossible worlds of the open kind.\n5.4 Impossible Worlds in Relevance Logic\n\nRelevance logic\n (or relevant logic) is an attempt to capture the idea that good\nreasoning requires a genuine condition between premises and\nconclusions. This should go beyond a mere guarantee of truth\npreservation. For when a conclusion \\(A\\) is guaranteed to be true\n(for example, when it is a logical truth), any argument\nconcluding in \\(A\\) will preserve truth from premises to conclusions.\nBut those premises may have no genuine connection whatsoever to what\n\\(A\\) is about. The same consideration applies when taking a\nconditional \\(A \\rightarrow B\\) to be valid: there should be a genuine\nconnection between \\(A\\) and \\(B\\).\n\nWith this in mind, relevance logic attempts to avoid the\n\u2018fallacies of relevance\u2019 (also called \u2018paradoxes of\nthe material conditional\u2019). These are conditionals that are\nvalid in classical and modal logic, simply because the antecedent is a\nnecessary falsehood or the consequent is a necessary truth, but\nwithout a guarantee of any real connection between them. Examples\ninclude \\(A \\wedge \\neg A \\rightarrow B\\) (ex contradictione\nquodlibet, or the Law of Explosion), \\(A \\rightarrow B \\vee \\neg\nB\\), and \\(A \\rightarrow (B \\rightarrow B)\\) (verum ex\nquolibet).\n\nContradiction-realizing impossible worlds can help us avoid ex\ncontradictione quodlibet, if they are worlds where some\ncontradiction \\(A \\wedge \\neg A\\) is true but some other \\(B\\) is not\ntrue. For that reason, various systems of relevant logic have been\ngiven semantics which include (things naturally thought of as)\nimpossible worlds.\n\nA Routley-Meyer interpretation (see Routley and Routley 1972;\nRoutley and Meyer 1973, 1976; Routley 1979) for relevant\n(propositional) logics is a structure \\(\\langle W, N, R, {}^*,\nv\\rangle\\), where \\(W\\) is a set of worlds; \\(N\\) is a proper subset\nof \\(W\\) including the normal or possible worlds (the remaining worlds\nare the non-normal or impossible worlds); \\(R\\) is a ternary\naccessibility relation between worlds, and \\({}^*\\) (the Routley\nstar) is a function from worlds to worlds. \\({}^*\\) and \\(R\\)\nfigure prominently in the truth conditions for negation and the\n(relevant) conditional. Their task is precisely to provide a semantics\nfor negation that allows for the truth of \\(A\\) and \\(\\neg A\\) at some\nworlds, and a semantics for the conditional that frees it from the\nfallacies of relevance.\n5.4.1 The Relevant Conditional\n\nIn order to get rid of such entailments as \\(A \\rightarrow (B\n\\rightarrow B)\\), we need some world at which \\(A\\) holds but \\(B\n\\rightarrow B\\) fails. One way to achieve this may be to admit\n\u201cpartial\u201d or incomplete situations of the kind studied in\n situation semantics,\n at which \\(A\\) holds but \\(B \\rightarrow B\\) fails to hold, just\nbecause they carry no information about \\(B\\). Another way is via\nimpossible worlds: an understanding of such worlds, as we have seen,\nis as scenarios where logical laws may fail, and the Law of\n(propositional) Identity, stating that any formula entails itself, is\none of them. At possible worlds, we still require for the truth of\nconditionals \\(A \\rightarrow B\\) that at every accessible world where\n\\(A\\) holds, \\(B\\) holds, too. Consequently, \\(A \\rightarrow(B\n\\rightarrow B)\\) is not logically valid. Technically, when \\(w\\) is an\nimpossible world, we state the truth conditions for the conditional,\nby means of the ternary \\(R\\), as follows:\n\n(\\(\\rightarrow\\)) \n\\(v_w (A \\rightarrow B) =\\) true if and only if, for all\nworlds \\(w_1\\) and \\(w_2\\) such that \\(Rww_1 w_2\\), if \\(v_{w1}(A) =\\)\ntrue, then \\(v_{w2}(B) =\\) true. \n\n\nThe key difference between \\((\\rightarrow)\\) and the standard modal\nclause for the strict conditional (which is true at a world if and\nonly if, at all accessible worlds where the antecedent is true, the\nconsequent is true), is that the worlds of the antecedent and the\nconsequent have been \u201csplit\u201d. Specifically, \\(B\n\\rightarrow B\\) fails at impossible worlds \\(w\\) when there are worlds\n\\(w_1\\) and \\(w_2\\) such that R\\(ww_1 w_2, B\\) holds at the former,\nbut fails at the latter. Since we do not want \\(B \\rightarrow B\\) to\nfail at normal/possible worlds, we can add a Normality\nCondition, saying that the accessible worlds \\(w_1\\) and \\(w_2\\)\nare one and the same:\n\n(NC)  For normal worlds\n\\(w, Rww_1 w_2\\) only if \\(w_1 = w_2\\). \n\n\nUsing the ternary relation \\(R\\), one can build models for different\nrelevant logics. Starting with the basic relevant system\n\\(\\mathbf{B}\\), one obtains models for stronger logics such as\n\\(\\mathbf{R}\\), the system of relevant implication, by adding\nadditional conditions on \\(R\\). (This is similar to the way we may\nmove on from basic modal logic \\(\\mathbf{K}\\) to the systems\n\\(\\mathbf{T}, \\mathbf{S4}\\), and \\(\\mathbf{S5}\\), by adding extra\nconditions on the accessibility relation.) The constraints to be added\nto the ternary \\(R\\) are more complex than those of standard modal\nlogic and some involve the star operator \\({}^*\\) (which we\u2019ll\naddress shortly).\n\nIt isn\u2019t easy to provide an intuitive reading for the ternary\nrelation \\(R\\). The basic idea is that the truth of an entailment \\(A\n\\rightarrow B\\) at a world \\(w\\) depends on \\(w\\)\u2019s\n\u201cseeing an accessibility\u201d (Bremer 2005: 67) between two\nother worlds \\(w_1\\) and \\(w_2\\), such that if \\(A\\) is true at the\nformer, \\(B\\) is true at the latter. But what does this mean? This is\nperhaps the most important philosophical issue facing semantics for\nrelevant logics. One approach is the information-based account of\nMares (2004, 2009, 2010) and Restall (1995), based on\n situation semantics.\n Another approach draws on various interpretations of\nconditionality, such as those found in the literature on\nconditional logics (Beall et al. 2012). (See the entry on\n relevance logic\n or Jago 2013c for further discussion.)\n5.4.2 The Routley Star\n\nGiven a world \\(w\\), the Routley star function outputs a world \\(w^*\\)\nwhich is, in a sense, its \u201creverse twin\u201d. The truth\nconditions for negation within the Routley-Meyer semantics are:\n\n(\\(\\neg\\))   \\(v_w\n(\\neg A) =\\) true if and only if \\(v_{w^*}(A) =\\)\nfalse. \n\n\nSo \\(\\neg A\\) is true at a world \\(w\\) if and only if \\(A\\) is false,\nnot at \\(w\\) itself (as it happens with standard negation), but at its\ntwin \\(w^*\\). Relevant negation is therefore an intensional\noperator: in order to evaluate negated sentences at \\(w\\), we may need\nto check the goings on at some other world.\n\nAdding appropriate constraints provides this negation with many\nintuitive inferential features. If \\(w^{**} = w\\) for all worlds\n\\(w\\), for example, Double Negation introduction and elimination is\nvalid. This is often called De Morgan negation, for De\nMorgan\u2019s Laws hold of it. But it does not validate the Law of\nExplosion (that a contradiction entails any sentence). For a\ncounterexample, take a model where \\(A\\) holds at \\(w, B\\)\ndoesn\u2019t hold at \\(w\\), and \\(A\\) doesn\u2019t hold at \\(w^*\\).\nThen, both \\(A\\) and \\(\\neg A\\) hold at \\(w\\), whereas \\(B\\)\ndoesn\u2019t: \\(w\\) is an inconsistent but non-trivial world.\n\nWhat is the intuitive connection between \\(w\\) and \\(w^*\\)? The idea\nis that the twins are \u201cmirror images one of the other reversing\n\u2018in\u2019 and \u2018out\u2019\u201d (Dunn 1986: 191). If\n\\(w\\) is \\(A\\)-inconsistent (both \\(A\\) and \\(\\neg A\\) hold), then\n\\(w^*\\) is \\(A\\)-incomplete (neither \\(A\\) nor \\(\\neg A\\) hold), and\nvice versa. The \\({}^*\\) takes local inconsistency into local\nincompleteness and vice versa. It may also be the case that \\(w =\nw^*\\): the twins are in fact one. In that case, \\(w\\) must be a\nmaximal and consistent world, where negation behaves classically:\n\\(\\neg A\\) is true if and only if \\(A\\) is false there.\n6. Objections to Impossible Worlds\n\nThis last section discusses some difficulties for impossible worlds\ntheories.\n6.1 The Exportation Principle\n\nSuppose that the expression \u2018at world \\(w\\)\u2019 works as a\nrestricting modifier: its main task consists in restricting the\nquantifiers within its scope to parts of \\(w\\) (Lewis 1986). If so,\nthen it should distribute through the truth-functional connectives.\nThis means in particular that \n\\[ \\text{At } w: (A \\wedge \\neg A) \\]\n\n\nwill entail the contradiction \n\\[ (\\text{At } w: A) \\wedge \\neg (\\text{at } w: A). \\]\n\n\nThis is the exportation principle. It is disastrous for any\ntheory of impossible worlds. It implies that an inconsistency at some\nimpossible world will spill over into an overt inconsistency. A true\ncontradiction at some \\(w\\) implies that there are true\ncontradictions, full stop. This is hard to swallow, unless one is a\ndialetheist. (And even\n dialethists\n may want to reject the exportation principle for impossible worlds:\nsee Jago 2013b.)\n\nAvoiding the exportation principle is not difficult, however (Kiourti\n2010, Chapter 4; Jago 2013b). For it to be valid, it seems to require\ngenuine worlds, as in Lewis\u2019s (1986) genuine modal realism or\nYagisawa\u2019s (1988, 2010) extended modal realism. Adopting an\nersatz conception of worlds blocks the principle. If a world\nrepresents that \\(A\\) (say, by containing a sentence or proposition\nexpressing that A), but is not in itself such that \\(A\\),\nthen the principle is blocked. \u2018At \\(w: (A \\wedge \\neg\nA)\\)\u2019 will be interpreted as: \\(w\\) contains the sentence (or\nproposition) that A \\(\\wedge \\neg A\\), whereas \u2018at \\(w:\nA\\)\u2019 will mean that \\(w\\) contains the sentence (or proposition)\nthat A, and \u2018not at \\(w: A\\)\u2019 will mean that\n\\(w\\) does not contain the sentence (or proposition) that A.\nBut an impossible world may contain both, or neither, of \\(A\\) and\n\\(\\neg A\\), so that containing one implies nothing about containing\nthe other. An impossible world may (depending on how fine-grained we\ntake them to be) also contain the conjunction \\(A \\wedge \\neg A\\)\nindependently of whether it contains both \\(A\\) and \\(\\neg A.\\) So the\ninference from \u2018at \\(w: (A \\wedge \\neg A)\\)\u2019 to \u2018(at\n\\(w: A) \\wedge \\neg\\)(at \\(w: A)\\)\u2019 is blocked (possibly twice\nover).\n\nIt is controversial whether any genuine account of worlds can block\nthe exportation principle. Jago 2013a,b argues not; Yagisawa 2015\nresponds in defence of genuine impossible worlds.\n6.2 Defining Possibility\n\nIf there are impossible worlds, then we cannot accept the simple\nclause for possibility:\n\n(P)   It is possible\nthat \\(A\\) if and only if there\u2019s a world \\(w\\) such that, at\n\\(w\\), \\(A\\). \n\n\nOnce impossible worlds enter the stage, (P) becomes false from right\nto left. We therefore need a principle that restricts the\nquantification in the right half of the biconditional to\npossible worlds. How to do that, without appealing to modal\nnotions, is not straightforward. A hybrid account (Berto 2010) can\nanswer the objection, by taking possible worlds to be all and only the\ngenuine ones, with impossible worlds as ersatz constructions of some\nkind. We can then capture the intent of (P) as:\n\n(P\\({}^*\\))  It is\npossible that \\(A\\) if and only if there\u2019s a genuine world \\(w\\)\nsuch that, at \\(w\\), \\(A\\). \n\n\nNote that it doesn\u2019t matter if the hybrid account accepts the\nexistence of ersatz possible worlds in addition to her genuine\npossible worlds: (P\\({}^*\\)) will still give the right result.\n\nThe ersatzist may respond by biting the bullet. Even without admitting\nimpossible worlds, most possible worlds accounts do not aim at\nproviding a reductive and complete analysis of modality.\n(Lewis\u2019s modal realism does. But it may not succeed, when\nso-called \u2018alien\u2019 properties, not instantiated by anything\nat the actual world nor obtainable as constructions out of actually\ninstantiated properties, enter the stage. See Divers 2002, Chapter 7;\nDivers and Melia 2002.)\n6.3 The Usefulness of Impossible Worlds\n\nStalnaker (1996) argues that, whilst there is nothing wrong in\nadmitting impossible worlds, not much explanatory work can be expected\nfrom them. For instance, if one takes worlds as sets of propositions,\none cannot then analyze propositions as sets of worlds. But an\nadvocate of impossible worlds may respond that the same point can be\nmade against any account of possible worlds (such as Adams\u2019s)\nthat takes them to be maximally consistent sets of propositions. And,\njust as ersatz possible worlds needn\u2019t be constructed in this\nway, nor need ersatz impossible worlds. Impossible worlds have found\nmany uses in the recent literature, as we have abundantly seen. So we\ndon\u2019t find Stalnaker\u2019s worry convincing.\n6.4 The Semantics of Negation\n\nThe standard semantic clause for negation has it that \\(\\neg A\\) is\ntrue if and only if \\(A\\) is not true. So there could not be worlds at\nwhich both or neither of \\(A\\) and \\(\\neg A\\) are true, unless we\nrevise the semantics of negation. Stalnaker (1996) argues that\nnegation is such a basic operator, whose semantics is \u2018learned\nin a first logic class\u2019 that it had better be left alone.\n\nTo this, the impossible world theorist can reply that it is in fact\nthe case that \\(\\neg A\\) is true if and only if \\(A\\) is not true; for\nthis concerns truth simpliciter, that is, truth at the actual\nworld. She may also agree that the same holds for any possible world.\nBut it is precisely impossible worlds that we are talking\nabout here; how negation works at any possible world need not be\naffected by the fact that, at some impossible world or other, some\nsentence can hold together with its negation: this is one of the\nthings that makes them impossible, after all.\n6.5 Counterpossible Reasoning\n\nTimothy Williamson (2007, Chapter 5) has objected to non-trivial\ntreatments of counterpossibles, in particular (though not perforce)\nwhen they resort to impossible worlds. Consider the claim:\n\nIf \\(5 + 7\\) were 13, then \\(5 + 6\\) would be 12.\n\n\nPrima facie, this is a non-trivially true counterpossible.\nHowever, Williamson argues, other non-trivial consequences of the\nsupposition would then be that \\(5 + 5 = 11\\), and \\(5 + 4 = 10\\), and\n\u2026 , and \\(0 = 1\\). Therefore,\n\nIf the number of answers I gave to a given question were 0, then\nthe number of answers I gave would be 1.\n\n\nBut (2) is clearly false.\n\nBrogaard and Salerno (2007) pose a dilemma for Williamson: either we\nhold the context fixed in this kind of counterpossible reasoning, or\nwe don\u2019t. If we don\u2019t, then (2) does not follow from (1).\nIn particular, the context at which (2) comes out false is one at\nwhich the closest antecedent worlds are possible and, to be sure, at\nthose worlds, 0 is not 1. But if we hold the context fixed, then what\ndoes follow is just the following counterpossible:\n\nIf 0 were 1 and the number of right answers I gave were 0, then\nthe number of right answers I gave would be 1.\n\n\nNow this is intuitively true, and non-trivially so.\n\nWilliamson (2007) also argues that non-trivial treatments of\ncounterpossibles create opaque contexts, in which the substitutivity\nof co-referential terms fails. Supporters of non-trivial\ncounterpossibles will take the following conditional as false:\n\nIf Hesperus had not been Phosphorus, then Phosphorus would not\nhave been Phosphorus.\n\n\nGiven the necessity of identity, (4) is a counterpossible: as Hesperus\nis Phosphorus, its antecedent can only be true at impossible worlds.\nThat\u2019s false, supposedly, because even if Hesperus and\nPhosphorus had been distinct, Phosphorus would have remained\nself-identical. However, all accept that\n\nIf Hesperus had not been Phosphorus, then Hesperus would not have\nbeen Phosphorus\n\n\nsince it is an instance of \u2018if it had been that \\(A\\), then it\nwould have been that \\(A\\)\u2019. Yet substituting\n\u2018Phosphorus\u2019 for the first occurrence of\n\u2018Hesperus\u2019 in the consequent of (5) gives (4). Since (5)\nis true and (4) is (supposedly) false, substitution of identicals has\nfailed. This failure of substitutivity, Williamson claims, is a bad\nresult, for counterfactuals should not create opaque\ncontexts.\n\nBrogaard and Salerno (2013) accept that counterpossibles do create\nopaque contexts. They argue that the impossible worlds similarity\nsemantics for counterpossibles should be \u201cpartially\nepistemic\u201d (Brogaard and Salerno 2013: 654), and this epistemic\ncomponent explains the failure of substitution.\n\nAn alternative reply to Williamson is that the objection is\nquestion-begging. It is clearly false that counterfactuals allow\nsubstitution of identical terms (of arbitrary type). \u2018Had\nAristotle never taught, Aristotle would still have been\nAristotle\u2019 is true, and Aristotle is the teacher of Alexander,\nyet \u2018had Aristotle never taught, Aristotle would still have been\nthe teacher of Alexander\u2019 is clearly false. The substitution\nprinciple must (at the least) be restricted to rigid\ndesignators: terms that denote the same entity in all\nmetaphysically possible worlds. But if the definition of\n\u2018rigid designator\u2019 is to be restricted to\npossible worlds, then the application of the corresponding\nsubstitution principle should likewise be restricted to contexts which\ndo not invoke impossible worlds. Viewed from this perspective, it is\nquestion-begging to insist at the outset that the substitution\nprinciple (for rigid designators) is valid for all counterfactuals\n(including counterpossibles).\n\nBerto et al. 2018 is an extensive discussion of a number of\nWilliamsonian objections to non-trivial treatments of\ncounterpossibles.\n6.6 Compositionality\n\nCompositionality is the principle that the meaning or content\nof a complex expression is a function of the meanings of its\nconstituent expressions. It\u2019s commonly taken to be a mandatory\nfeature of any adequate theory of meaning and content. The argument is\nthat, as competent speakers of a language, we are in principle capable\nof grasping the meanings of a potentially infinite number of\nsentences. And since we\u2019ve learnt the meanings of a limited\nnumber of words, this is possible only if the meanings of complex\nsentences are obtainable recursively from the meanings of their\nconstituent parts (Davidson 1965).\n\nThe worry is that a theory of meaning or content which includes\nimpossible worlds will not be compositional. Consider what we said\nabove about the exportation principle (Section 6.1) and the semantics\nof negation (Section 6.4). An impossible world may represent that\n\\(\\neg A\\) independently of whether it represents that \\(A\\). But\nthen, for such worlds, the truth-value of \\(\\neg A\\) is not a function\nof the truth-value of \\(A\\). So, the worry goes, the content or\nproposition that \\(\\neg A\\), understood as a set of possible and\nimpossible worlds, will not be a function of the proposition that\n\\(A\\). Certainly, the latter is not the set-theoretic complement of\nthe former, as it is on the possible worlds account. The same goes for\nall the other logically complex sentences. This is perhaps the most\nserious objection to the impossible worlds approach. If it can\u2019t\nbe met, it may well be fatal.\n\nTo address the worry, defenders of impossible worlds must show that\ntheir notion of content is compositional, even if it does not provide\nuniform truth-conditions across all worlds. In other words, they must\nspecify a way to calculate complex contents from constituent contents,\nbut which does not go via the usual truth-at-a-world clauses for\nconnectives. As far as we know, the only attempt to achieve this is in\nBerto and Jago 2019, Chapter 8. They view contents as sets of\n(possible and impossible) worlds, which are themselves sets of\nsentences of some \u2018worldmaking\u2019 language. They argue that\ngrammatical structures can thus be recovered from semantic contents,\nvia the syntactic structure of the worldmaking sentences involved.\nThis provides a functional map between grammatical structure and\nsemantic content which in turn, they argue, provides a means for\ncalculating complex contents from their constituents. Whether this\nprovides an acceptable notion of compositionality (as they claim)\nremains to be seen.\n\nThe compositionally objection also appears in Williamson 2020, a book\nmostly devoted to a defense of the extensional material conditional as\ngiving the meaning of the indicative \u201cif\u201d, but also\ndealing with counterfactuals. Williamson accuses hyperintensional\napproaches to conditionals and to content in general \u2014 whether\nbased on impossible worlds, or of other kinds, e.g., based on\ntruthmakers \u2014 of \u201coverfitting\u201d: complicating the\nsemantics in order to account for the variability and systematic\ninconsistencies of speakers\u2019 judgments, with the result of\nincorporating \u201cnoise\u201d in their models. At the extreme of\nfine-graining, open impossible worlds approaches \u201cmust\nindividuate meanings so finely as to restrict synonymy to\nself-synonymy, and thereby render the conception of meaning\ntheoretically useless, because it filters nothing out\u201d\n(249).\n\nOf course, hyperintensionalists (with impossible worlds sympathies, or\nof other kind) may equally accuse extensional or merely intensional\nsemantics of \u201cunderfitting\u201d: conflating contents we may\nhave good reasons to keep distinct. We seem to need some principled\nway to mark the proper boundaries of semantics. Williamson proposes\none: we should pay more attention to a cognitive or epistemic level,\nintermediate between semantics and pragmatics. Many intuitive\ndistinctions hyperintensionalists try to force into the semantics are\nbetter explained as belonging to competent speakers\u2019\ncognitive-epistemic heuristics. He grants, for instance, that the view\nthat counterpossibles are not all trivially true speaks to our\nintuitions; but objects that \u201csometimes, the robustly shared\nverdicts of native speakers on a sample sentence will simply be false,\nthe predictable output of a fallible human heuristic.\u201d\n(265).\n\nSome authors, e.g. Rothschild (2021), argue that the Williamsonian\nstance is at odds with standard practice in semantics. The early\nchapters of any textbook introduction to semantics (e.g., Chierchia\nand McConnell-Ginet 1990; Heim and Kratzer 1997) tell us that one key\ntask of semantics is to account for (rather than explain away)\ncompetent speakers\u2019 intuitions and judgments of synonymy,\nantonymy, entailment, etc. Williamson\u2019s endorsement of the\nextensional material conditional gives, of course, a very simple\nsemantics for the indicative \u201cif\u201d; but, says Rothschild,\n\u201cthe simplicity comes at the cost of failing to integrate\nconditionals with the compositional semantics of natural\nlanguage\u201d (22). And once the heuristic procedures are developed\nin order to carry out the aforementioned key task, \u201cit is not\nclear that Williamson\u2019s overall system will still look\nsimple\u201d. (Ibid.)\n\nThe compositionally objection is also raised by Fine 2021, who\nproposes his truthmaker semantics as a hyperintensional account of\ncontent in place of possible and impossible worlds-based accounts.\nFine\u2019s semantics (2017a,b) uses states in place of\nworlds, where states are things that may fail to be maximal (making\nsome sentences neither true nor false), and they may be inconsistent.\nInconsistent states may be formed as mereological sums of consistent\nstates, e.g., summing the state in which the table is round with one\nin which it is square gives an impossible situation in which there is\na round square table. (To handle conjunction, Fine requires each set\nof states to have a mereological sum, so he is committed to\ninconsistent states like this.) Impossible worlds, too, may be\ninconsistent and incomplete. One live issue is thus whether truthmaker\nsemantics is a notational variant of a kind of impossible worlds\nsemantics, rather than an alternative to it. Ontologically, they seem\non a par and, in this sense, truthmaker semantics can be seen as a\nform of impossible worlds semantics. However, it is probably more\nappropriate to view truthmaker semantics as a rival to standard\nimpossible worlds accounts. Central to truthmaker semantics is the\nnotion of exact truthmaking, whereby the state in question is\nwholly relevant to the sentence\u2019s truth. Truthmaker semantics\nstakes its reputation on the utility of this notion, whereas standard\nimpossible worlds semantics does not.\n\nFine\u2019s approach is appealing with respect to the compositionally\nworry: it provides uniform clauses for the Boolean connectives at a\nstate, irrespective of whether the state is consistent. But the same\ncan be said of some impossible worlds semantics, e.g. the worlds\nsemantics for First Degree Entailment (FDE), a simple four-valued,\nparaconsistent logic (Dunn 1976, Belnap 1977a-b) which has been\nprovided with a worlds semantics including worlds where formulas can\nbe both true and false, or neither true nor false. But whether uniform\nclauses can be given for all operators is unclear. In Fine\u2019s\n2012 semantics for counterfactuals, for instance, counterfactuals may\nbe evaluated only with respect to possible worlds (which are, in\neffect, maximal possible states), with the consequence that embedded\ncounterfactuals are not permitted. It is currently unclear whether\nevaluation of counterfactuals at impossible states would require\nnon-uniform clauses.\n\nAnother compositionally-based worry concerns negation: are the\nnegations of equivalent sentences themselves equivalent? This will not\nbe the case in general within impossible worlds semantics. The\nsituation with truthmaker semantics is not straightforward: it holds\nin some but not all systems (e.g. not in Fine and Jago 2019).\nFine\u2019s response is not to banish those weaker systems, but to\nprefer certain systems for certain purposes. That response is also\nopen to friends of impossible worlds.\n\nUndoubtedly, other objections to impossible worlds can and are likely\nto be raised. The current debate on impossible worlds appears to be at\nthe same stage as the one on possible worlds was, some forty\nyears ago. At that time, people struggled to make sense of the concept\nof a possible world. Many declared it meaningless. Nowadays, the\nvariety of its applications has placed the notion firmly at the core\nof much philosophical and logical practice (see e.g., Divers 2002,\nChapter 4). Impossible worlds may undergo the same fate, should they\nprove as useful as they appear to be in the treatment of\nimpossibilities of various kinds.",
