The so-called \u201clinguistic\nturn\u201d that marked many areas of philosophy and literature also\ninfluenced the philosophy of history. Whereas analytic philosophy of\nhistory had emphasized scientific analogies for historical knowledge\nand advanced the goals of verifiability and generalizability in\nhistorical knowledge, English-speaking philosophers in the 1970s and\n1980s were increasingly influenced by hermeneutic philosophy,\npost-modernism, and French literary theory (Rorty 1979). These\nphilosophers emphasized the rhetoric of historical writing, the\nnon-reducibility of historical narrative to a sequence of\n\u201cfacts\u201d, and the degree of construction that is involved\nin historical representation. Affinities with literature and\nanthropology came to eclipse examples from the natural sciences as\nguides for representing historical knowledge and historical\nunderstanding. The richness and texture of the historical narrative\ncame in for greater attention than the attempt to provide causal\nexplanations of historical outcomes. Frank Ankersmit captured many of\nthese themes in his treatment of historical narrative (1995; Ankersmit\nand Kellner 1995); see also Berkhofer (1995).\n\nThis \u201cnew\u201d philosophy of history is distinguished from\nanalytic philosophy of history in several important respects. It\nemphasizes historical narrative rather than historical causation. It\nis intellectually closer to the hermeneutic tradition than to the\npositivism that underlay the analytic philosophy of history of the\n1960s. It highlights features of subjectivity and multiple\ninterpretation over those of objectivity, truth, and correspondence to\nthe facts. Another important strand in this approach to the philosophy\nof history is a clear theoretical preference for the historicist\nrather than the universalist position on the status of human\nnature\u2014Herder rather than Vico. The prevalent perspective holds\nthat human consciousness is itself a historical product, and that it\nis an important part of the historian\u2019s work to piece together\nthe mentality and assumptions of actors in the past (Pompa 1990).\nSignificantly, contemporary historians such as Robert Darnton have\nturned to the tools of ethnography to permit this sort of discovery\n(1984).\n\nAnother important strand of thinking within analytic philosophy has\nfocused attention on historical ontology (Hacking 2002, Little 2010).\nThe topic of historical ontology is important, both for philosophers\nand for practicing historians. Ontology has to do with the question,\nwhat kinds of things do we need to postulate in a given realm?\nHistorical ontology poses this question with regard to the realities\nof the past. Should large constructs like \u2018revolution\u2019,\n\u2018market society\u2019, \u2018fascism\u2019, or\n\u2018Protestant religious identity\u2019 be included in our\nontology as real things? Or should we treat these ideas in a purely\nnominalistic way, treating them as convenient ways of aggregating\ncomplex patterns of social action and knowledge by large numbers of\nsocial actors in a time and place? Further, how should we think about\nthe relationship between instances and categories in the realm of\nhistory, for example, the relation between the French, Chinese, or\nRussian Revolutions and the general category of\n\u2018revolution\u2019? Are there social kinds that recur in\nhistory, or is each historical formation unique in important ways?\nThese are all questions of ontology, and the answers we give to them\nwill have important consequences for how we conceptualize and explain\nthe past.\n",
