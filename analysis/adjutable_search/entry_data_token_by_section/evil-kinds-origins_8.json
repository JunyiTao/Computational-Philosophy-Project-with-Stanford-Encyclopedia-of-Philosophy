    "main_text": "Symbolic Evil\n6. Symbolic Evil\n\nSymbolic value is a less familiar idea in philosophy than it\nis in Anthropology, Religious Studies, and the other social sciences\nthat deal with production, exchange, and consumption. The main idea is\nthat an object or act can have far more \u201csymbolic\u201d value\nto a certain individual than its exchange or monetary value on some\nmarket or other, typically because of its causal history. That bauble\ngiven to you by a now-deceased friend has far more symbolic value (to\nyou, at least) than the monetary or exchange value that it would fetch\nat auction. This is because the gift had its origin in the generosity\nof a friend who has since died, has the ability to invoke his memory,\nand so on.\n\nSymbolic disvalue works in an analogous way. Products that\nfetch a certain monetary value on an open market may have significant\nsymbolic disvalue that is not reflected in their price. This\ndisvalue often arises, again, from the product\u2019s provenance: an\nindustrial chicken sandwich is a result of the obscene degradation of\nanimals, workers, and the environment on the part of an industry that\npays revolving-door lobbyists to promote food policy that, in turn,\nkeeps production costs and prices artificially low, in part by\nexternalizing most of the harms it causes. In some cases, such\ndisvalue may be significant enough to make purchasing the product\nwrong, even if doing so does not lead, causally, to any actual harm or\nrights-infringement (see Chignell 2016).\n\nThe term \u201cevil\u201d is typically only applied in cases of\nsymbolic disvalue when there is something excessive about them.\nStepping on a flag or consuming a chicken sandwich might have some\nsymbolic disvalue, but it would be strange to say that these are cases\nof symbolic evil. Having anything to do with soap made from\nthe body fat of people murdered at the Stutthof concentration camp, by\ncontrast, seems downright evil, even if the intended consequences\n(i.e., getting oneself clean) are good. Indeed, the symbolic evil\nattached to such a product may \u201ctouch\u201d everyone who was\npart of the society that permitted its manufacture, whether they were\ndirectly involved or not. The evil of sustained chattel slavery may\nhave a similar sort of symbolic power, even generations later.\n\nBoth the nature and the origins of symbolic evil are hard to\ncharacterize; thus it is hard to see where it fits in the Table of\nEvils. Is there a metaphysical aspect to symbolic evil, or is it fully\nempirical? Is its origin entirely natural, or moral, or is there\nsomething spooky and non-agential about it? A related set of\ndifficulties has to do with the fact that, in some contexts anyway,\nthe transfer of symbolic disvalue operates via the complex logic of\n\u201ctaint\u201d, contagion, or uncleanness. Some philosophers who\nwrite about symbolic value argue that the only way to avoid being\n\u201ctouched\u201d by such evil is via active and explicit\ndissociation\u2014a symbolic \u201cstanding with the\ngood\u201d (R. Adams 1999). In other words, even if our abstinence\ndoes not make a difference, we must symbolically oppose an\nevil practice by, say, explicitly signaling opposition and (where\npossible) refusing to consume or benefit from its results (see Hill\n1983; Appiah 1986).\n",
