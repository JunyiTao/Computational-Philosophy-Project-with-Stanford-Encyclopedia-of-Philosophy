    "main_text": "Phenomenology of Life and the Concept of Transcendental Affectivity || Life and the Living: Philosophy of Christianity\n2.3 Life and the Living: Philosophy of Christianity\n\nWith the publication of I Am the Truth. Toward a Philosophy of\nChristianity in 1996, phenomenology of life was extended to a\nphilosophical reading of Christianity. This \u201cextension\u201d\nwas already announced in 1992 with a talk given at the Ecole Normale\nSup\u00e9rieure under the title \u201cParole et religion: La parole\nde Dieu\u201d (\u201cSpeech and Religion: The Word of God\u201d)\nwhich contains\u2014sometimes word for word\u2014some of the main\ntheses that will be developed in I Am the Truth. Incarnation\n(2000) and Words of Christ (2002) continue to pursue the\nproject of a philosophy of Christianity by focusing on the concepts of\nflesh and revelation, respectively. But what does a philosophical or\neven a phenomenological \u201creading\u201d of Christianity mean\nhere? To be sure, Henry\u2019s philosophical approach does not rely\non religious faith in the sense that his phenomenology of life would\npresuppose Christian faith. It is rather the other way\naround: as Henry himself admitted, it is the development of his\nphenomenology that led him to discover in the Scriptures an intuition\nof life that, although written in a non-philosophical language,\ncorresponds to his own phenomenological concept of immanent\naffectivity.\n\nFrom a philosophical perspective, the turning point that leads Henry\nto his interpretation of Christianity is the need to account for\nindividual subjectivity as rooted in life, a life that is\ncommon to all the living and therefore transcends the living\nwhile remaining at the same time immanent. This aspect is present in\nHenry\u2019s thought long before he turns toward a philosophy of\nChristianity, when, following Kierkegaard, he repeatedly emphasizes\nthat the \u201cme\u201d is not its own foundation. This is why\nauto-affection is, for Henry, essentially tied to a form of passivity:\nsubjectivity is characterized by a dimension of suffering, i.e., of\npathos, without which it would simply not be living\nsubjectivity. Subjective powers of the \u201cI can\u201d therefore\nalways refer to a deep-seated and original powerlessness of a life\nthat cannot escape from itself. It is this relation between the living\nand life that Henry seeks to describe through the concept of\n\u201ctranscendental birth\u201d.\n\nTranscendental birth, which is identical to the birth of subjectivity,\ncannot be understood with reference to the world, for\ninstance as \u201cbeing-in-the-world\u201d. Henry argues: \n\n\nin the world and in the externality of its \u201coutside\u201d,\nno \u201cLiving\u201d is possible\u2014and consequently no livings\neither (IAT 71) \n\n\nIn other words, the status of auto-affection as immanent\nself-appearing\u2014i.e., Henry\u2019s definition of transcendental\nsubjectivity or ipseity (from ipse, self)\u2014cannot be\nengendered by something of an entirely different nature (the\nexteriority or \u201cexternality\u201d of the world), but must be\nengendered \u201cwithin\u201d auto-affection itself, i.e., within\nand through life.\n\nLife as capable of engendering the form of ipseity is, for Henry,\nabsolute life, which transcends each individual living being.\nSubjective powers described by the \u201cI can\u201d thus take place\nwhen the \u201cI\u201d is given to itself in auto-affection. By\nengendering individual life, absolute life engenders in fact itself.\nThis is, however, only possible in the form of ipseity, since life,\nfor Henry, equates with auto-affection, which in turn equates with\nipseity. In the language of Christianity, absolute life is God and the\noriginal form of ipseity (or \u201carchi-ipseity\u201d) is Christ as\nthe \u201cFirst living\u201d (Premier vivant).\n\nIn Henry\u2019s phenomenological terminology, the process of\nself-engendering reflects a transcendence in immanence:\nwithin the immanence of auto-affection, it is in fact absolute life\nthat affects itself through each living individual (see Lavigne 2009). Or, as Henry also\nputs it, absolute life gives itself to itself through the\nindividuality of the living and it is only through such\n\u201cparticipation\u201d that the latter can be said to be alive. This also leads Henry to distinguish an auto-affection in the strong sense (i.e. pertaining to absolute life) from an auto-affection in the weak sense (i.e. pertaining to the individual living being).\nThe relation of the living to absolute life is thus described by Henry\nas a relation of \u201csonship\u201d (filiation), whereby\ntranscendental birth does not denote a singular event but a stable\ncondition, namely the human condition as \u201cson of\nabsolute Life\u201d. Life\u2019s self-engendering is here understood\nas a continuous process, a movement of life\u2019s \u201ceternal\ncoming forth in itself\u201d (IAT 55) which thereby supports the life\nof each individual living. The living is thus understood as being\ncontinuously \u201ctraversed by Life\u201d, a condition, however,\nthat, being strictly immanent, can be \u201cforgotten\u201d by the\nindividual living being\u2014an aspect that will play a fundamental\nrole in Henry\u2019s ethical perspective (see\n Section 4.2).\n",
