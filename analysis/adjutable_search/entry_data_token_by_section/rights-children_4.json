Children\u2019s Rights and Adult Rights\n\nThose who deny that children do have rights can, as O\u2019Neill\nargues, believe that the interests of children are nevertheless\nadequately protected through adults\u2019 discharging relevant\nobligations. Yet, for some, the value of rights is not adequately\ncaptured in this manner. Joel Feinberg, for instance, believes that\nthe value of a right lies in those who possess it being able to claim\nfrom others what is specified as its content (Feinberg 1970).\n\nIf having rights does have a distinctive and special value in this\nkind of way, then it matters greatly that children can have at least\nsome rights. What might these be? As indicated at the outset, children\nare humans. They have at least the right to life that all humans have.\nNevertheless, children are not thought to have all the rights that\nadult humans do. Central amongst these rights is that of\nself-determination, that is, the right to make choices in respect of\none\u2019s own life. This right is the basis of derivative rights to\nmarry, have sex, choose one\u2019s work, purse a course of education,\nand so on.\n\nMost who believe that adults have rights which children do not have\nmake the cut between liberty and welfare rights. Feinberg\ndistinguishes between rights that belong only to adults (A-rights),\nrights that are common to both adults and children (A-C-rights), and\nrights that children alone possess (C-rights) (Feinberg 1980). Thus, a\ncommon position is that the A-rights include, centrally, the liberty\nrights, and that the A-C-rights include, centrally, the welfare\nrights. To repeat, liberty rights are rights of choice (how and\nwhether to vote, what to say publicly, whether to practise a religion\nand which one, which if any association to join, and so on), whereas\nwelfare rights protect important interests (such as health, bodily\nintegrity, and privacy).\n\nWhat might be included in the C-rights? Feinberg distinguishes between\ntwo sub-classes of C-rights. There are, first, those rights which\nchildren possess in virtue of their condition of childishness.\nAlthough Feinberg does not further divide this first sub-class of\nC-rights, this can be done. There are the rights children have to\nreceive those goods they are incapable of securing for themselves and\nare incapable of so doing because of their dependence upon adults.\nThese goods might include food and shelter. There are, second, the\nrights to be protected against harms which befall children because of\ntheir childlike vulnerability and whose harmfulness is a function of a\nfact that they befall children. These harms might include abuse and\nneglect. Note that some adults might be argued to merit the same\ndegree of rights-based protection on account of their childlike\nvulnerability and dependence.\n\nFinally, there are goods that children should arguably receive just\nbecause they are children. Those who have written on children\u2019s\ngoods do so for two reasons: first, to answer the question of what, as\na matter of justice, is owed to children; and, second, to answer the\nquestion of whether, and why if so, childhood is itself intrinsically\nvaluable (Gheaus 2015; Macleod 2010). Note that goods may be valuable\nto both children and adults, but of especial value to the former; or\nonly of value to children. Candidate goods include play and\ninnocence.\n\nHowever, the most central, and contentious, example is a child\u2019s\nright to be loved. This is not an A-C-right but it is arguably a\nC-right, and indeed is cited by many as a C-right (MacCormick 1976,\n305). Various declarations of children\u2019s rights include such a\nright and a respectable case can be made to meet the various\nobjections normally raised against its attribution (Liao 2015).\n\nIt is standard to classify the rights listed in the UNCRC under the\nthree P\u2019s: those of protection (for example, against abuse), of\nprovision (for example, of education), and of participation (for\nexample, to speak and to associate freely). Protection rights will be\naccorded to children but not to adults inasmuch the condition or state\nof childhood calls forth and requires this protection. Children, along\nwith adults, have provision rights but the content of these will\ndiffer between them because of the form that children\u2019s needs\nand circumstances take. Thus, grant that both children and adults have\na welfare right to health care. In the case of children, but not that\nof adults\u2019, paediatric care and treatment is appropriate. But\nthat fact is no different in its significance from the fact that\namongst different adults the proper form of health care should vary in\nline with their various disabilities, diseases, and circumstances.\n",
