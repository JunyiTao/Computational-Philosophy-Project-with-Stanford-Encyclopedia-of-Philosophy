    "main_text": "\n\n\nThe subject of legal reasoning appears to occupy the more practical end\nof the spectrum of jurisprudential theorising. Surely if anything\nmatters in our attempts to understand law, it matters how judges do\nand/or should decide cases, and that we have an account which\nadequately explains and can perhaps be used to guide or justify their activities.\nThe recent history of legal philosophy abounds with many and various\nattempts to address these issues and others which have been viewed as\nfalling within the ambit of legal reasoning. Is legal reasoning an\nactivity which is exclusive to the adjudicative institutions of legal\nsystems or is any reasoning about the law to be regarded as legal\nreasoning, no matter where or by whom it is undertaken? Does legal\nreasoning take on a special character when it is undertaken in courts\nand by judges? Are there special methods or modes of reasoning which\nare unique to or at least distinctive of the law, or is legal reasoning\njust like reasoning in any other sphere of human activity, distinctive\nonly in the subject matter to which it is applied? This last question\nis particularly relevant to present concerns, as it is one task of this\nentry to discuss various views concerning whether and to what extent\ninterpretation and coherence have a special role to play in legal\nreasoning, because of the nature of law itself. \n\n\nAfter a brief clarificatory consideration of the ambit of the term,\n\u2018legal reasoning\u2019, the entry deals first with\ninterpretation and then with coherence, and discusses various views\nconcerning these concepts and their relevance for law. Throughout, the\ndiscussion focuses upon the role which interpretation and coherence\nplay within legal reasoning, and the reasons why these concepts are\nregarded by some as being distinctive of reasoning about the law.\n",
