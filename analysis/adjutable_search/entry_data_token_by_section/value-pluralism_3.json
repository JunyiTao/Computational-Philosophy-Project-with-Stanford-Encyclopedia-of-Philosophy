    "main_text": "The Attraction of Pluralism || Discontinuities\n2.1 Discontinuities\n\nJohn Stuart Mill suggested that there are higher and lower pleasures\n(Mill 2002, p. 241), the idea being that the value of higher and lower\npleasures is measured on different scales. In other words, there are\ndiscontinuities in the measurement of value. As mentioned previously,\nit is unclear whether we should interpret Mill as a foundational\npluralist, but the notion of higher and lower pleasures is a very\nuseful one to illustrate the attraction of thinking that there are\ndiscontinuities in value. The distinction between higher and lower\npleasures allows us to say that no amount of lower pleasures can\noutweigh some amount of higher pleasures. As Mill puts it, it is\nbetter to be an unhappy human being than a happy pig. In other words,\nthe distinction allows us to say that there are discontinuities in\nvalue addition. As James Griffin (1986, p. 87) puts it: \u201cWe do\nseem, when informed, to rank a certain amount of life at a very high\nlevel above any amount of life at a very low level.\u201d\nGriffin\u2019s point is that there are discontinuities in the way we\nrank values, and this suggests that there are different\n values.[8]\n The phenomenon of discontinuities in our value rankings seems to\nsupport pluralism: if higher pleasures are not outweighed by lower\npleasures, that suggests that they are not the same sort of thing. For\nif they were just the same sort of thing, there seems to be no reason\nwhy lower pleasures will not eventually outweigh higher pleasures.\n\nRuth Chang argues that values form organic unities, which is to say\nthat adding more of one value to a situation may not make it better\noverall, the balance of values in the situation is also important. For\nexample, a life where extra pleasure is added, and all other value\ncontributions left untouched, may not be better overall, because now\nthe pleasure is unbalanced (Chang 2002). As Chang puts it, the Pareto\nprinciple of improvement (if something is better along one dimension\nand at least as good on all the others it will be better overall) does\nnot hold here.\n\nThe most extreme form of discontinuity is incommensurability or\nincomparability, when two values cannot be ranked at all. Pluralists\ndiffer on whether pluralism entails incommensurabilities, and on what\nincommensurability entails for the possibility of choice. Griffin\ndenies that pluralism entails incommensurability (Griffin uses the\nterm incomparability) whereas other pluralists embrace\nincommensurability, but deny that it entails that rational choice is\nimpossible. Some pluralists accept that there are sometimes cases\nwhere incommensurability precludes rational choice. We shall return to\nthese issues in Section 4.\n",
