Indeed, the new contradictions not only affected the\nconception of set and logical concepts, they also came to include the\nnotion of definability and its relation with a fundamental\nissue: the structure of the mathematical continuum and in particular\nwhether the continuum can be well-ordered and whether Cantor\u2019s\nContinuum Hypothesis (CH) holds.\n\nAt the Heidelberg Congress in 1904, Julius K\u00f6nig tried to refute\nCantor\u2019s continuum hypothesis. Due to a mistake discovered by\nZermelo, his paper was immediately withdrawn, but the subsequent year,\nK\u00f6nig produced a new argument.\n\nConsider the reals which are definable in finitely many\nwords. They form a countable sequence: \\(E_0, \\ldots,\nE_n,\\ldots\\). Since the continuum is uncountable, there exist reals\nnot occurring in the given enumeration. Assuming that the continuum is\nwell-ordered, there exists \u201cthe least real \\(E\\) which is not in\nthe sequence \\(\\{E_n \\mid n \\in \\Omega \\}\\)\u201d; this real is not\nin the sequence, but the very expression \u201cthe least real \\(E\\)\nwhich is not in the sequence\u201d defines \\(E\\) with finitely\nmany words; so \\(E\\) occurs somewhere in the sequence:\ncontradiction!\n\nK\u00f6nig also observed that the argument extends to the second\nnumber class and a similar paradox could be obtained by considering\nthe collection \\(\\mathbf{FOD}\\) of finitely definable countable\nordinals. In this case, taking inspiration from Cantor,\nK\u00f6nig\u2019s solution is that Cantor\u2019s second number class\nis not a set in a proper sense (a completed totality). To define a\nset, according to K\u00f6nig, one should provide not only a rule for\ndefining its elements, but also a means for distinguishing them.\n\nA contradiction related to K\u00f6nig\u2019s had been published\nslightly earlier by Jules Richard, a mathematician of a Lyce\u00e9\nin Dijon. Using an enumeration of all permutations with repetitions of\nthe twenty-six letters of the French alphabet, Richard noticed that\nthe set \\(E\\) of reals that can be defined by finitely many French\nwords is denumerable and hence one can assume to have an enumeration\n\\(u_1, u_2,\\ldots\\) of all those numbers. But then one can define the\nfollowing real \\(N\\): the integer part of \\(N\\) is 0, while its\n\\(n\\)th decimal digit of \\(N\\) is \\(p+1\\) if \\(u_n\\) has the \\(n\\)th\ndecimal digit \\(p\\) different from both 8 and 9; otherwise, the\n\\(n\\)th decimal digit of \\(N\\) is 1. By construction, \\(N\\) will not\noccur in \\(u_1, u_2,\\ldots\\). On the other hand, if we consider that\n\\(N\\) is defined by means of a finite collection of letters, this must\noccur in \\(u_1, u_2,\\ldots\\).\n\nContrary to K\u00f6nig, Richard did not rely upon the well-ordering of\nthe continuum, and the proposed solution is interesting for the\nfoundational debate to come. He pointed out that the definition of the\nnumber \\(N\\) refers to the totality of definable reals, to which \\(N\\)\nitself belong; but no object should be definable in terms of a\ncollection containing it. So it appears that the definition is\nviciously circular, and that makes the definition illusory. This idea\nsoon became the basis of Poincar\u00e9\u2019s solution, and\neventually also Russell\u2019s (see below\n 3.1,\n the issue of impredicatively defined collections).\n\nSo, why definability? The motivation was made clear for instance by\nBernstein\u2019s \u201cDie Theorie der reellen Zahlen\u201d\n(1905a), where Cantor\u2019s continuum hypothesis was claimed to be\nsettled in the positive. He criticized the so called \u201cDirichlet\nnotion\u201d of arbitrary function and stated that it is possible to\ngive a foundation to the continuum using only computable reals, i.e.,\nreals possessing an explicit \u201cformation law\u201d\n(\u201cBildungsgesetz\u201d).\n\nAccording to him, this is not a restriction since\u2014he\nclaims\u2014there are nondenumerably many computable reals in his\nsense. He also states that it is possible to display the new\ncomputable continuum in a hierarchy (i.e., a \\(\\subset\\)-increasing\nsequence) \\(\\{B_{\\alpha} \\mid \\alpha \\lt \\aleph_1\\}\\) of subsets of\n\\(N^N\\), which is defined in such a way that each \\(B_{\\alpha}\\) is at\nmost of cardinality \\(\\aleph_1\\) and hence that the cardinality of the\nunion of the sequence is at most \\(\\aleph_1\\). The idea is to start\nwith a basic domain \\(B_0 \\subset N^N\\) of simple functions (e.g.,\nthose having finitely many values), then to define a new domain\n\\(B_1\\) which extends \\(B_0\\) with operations that are defined from\nelements of \\(B_0\\), and so on.\n\nThough his claims are not justified, in the light of\nG\u00f6del\u2019s later work on constructibility, one might say that\nBernstein\u2019s basic intuition was sound: the continuum problem can\nbe settled, if one has an appropriately general notion of definability\n(or computability, constructibility) and by iterating it along the\nordinals.\n\nThis question was ultimately connected with the problem of\nunderstanding the atomistic continuum. The arithmetized\nconception\u2014in the sense of Dedekind or Cantor, where real\nnumbers are identified with suitable sets of rationals\u2014shifted\nthe attention towards arbitrary infinite sequences of natural\nnumbers. But this notion was not so easy to accept. According to\nBernstein (Bernstein 1905a, p. 449), an infinite sequence (or an\ninfinite set) must be given by a genuine rule. But what is a\nrule? Since one must be liberal (in order not to have just\nspecial classes of reals, if one is too restrictive), one is naturally\ndriven to think of arbitrary finitely described laws, shifting the\nattention towards the syntax of the rules. However, unless\none considers ordinary language, no such syntax is available and this\nengenders indeterminacy (this is Peano\u2019s diagnosis, see below\nPeano 1902\u20131906).\n\nThe need for a specification of infinite sets is crucial in the\ndiscussion of the related well-ordering problem. It also affects the\nrelated issue of the classification of discontinuous functions and\nanalytically representable functions of real variables, tackled by the\nFrench semi-intuitionists Borel, Baire and Lebesgue. At the same time,\nthey held the view that a mathematical entity (like an infinite set or\na function) exists only insofar as it is \u201cnameable by a finite\nnumber of words\u201d, against the platonistic views of Hadamard and\nZermelo (see Borel et al. 1905).\n",
