    "main_text": "The Problems of Revolution and Innovative Change\n1. The Problems of Revolution and Innovative Change\n\nThe difficulties in identifying and conceptualizing scientific\nrevolutions involve many of the most challenging issues in\nepistemology, methodology, ontology, philosophy of language, and even\nvalue theory. With revolution we immediately confront the problem of\ndeep, possibly noncumulative, conceptual and practical change, now in\nmodern science itself, a locus that Enlightenment thinkers would have\nfound surprising. And since revolution is typically driven by new\nresults, or by a conceptual-cum-social reorganization of old ones,\noften highly unexpected, we also confront the hard problem of\nunderstanding creative innovation. Third, major revolutions supposedly\nchange the normative landscape of research by altering the goals and\nmethodological standards of the enterprise, so we face also the\ndifficult problem of relating descriptive claims to normative claims\nand practices, and changes in the former to changes in the latter.\n\nComparing the world of business innovation and economic theory\nprovides a perspective on the difficulty of these problems, for both\nthe sciences and the industrial technologies change rapidly and\nsometimes deeply (in the aforementioned ways), thanks to what might be\ntermed \u201cinnovation push\u201d\u2014both the pressure to\ninnovate (to find and solve new problems, thereby creating new\ndesigns) and the pressure to accommodate innovation (see, e.g.,\nChristensen 1997; Christensen and Raynor, 2003; Arthur 2009). In a\nmarket economy, as in science, there is a premium on change driven by\ninnovation. Yet most economists have treated innovations as exogenous\nfactors\u2014as accidental, economically contingent events that come\nin from outside the economic system to work their effects. It is\nsurprising that only recently has innovation become a central topic of\neconomic theorists. Decades ago, the Austrian-American economist\nJoseph Schumpeter characterized economic innovation as\n\nthe process of industrial mutation\u2014if I may use that biological\nterm\u2014that incessantly revolutionizes the economic structure\nfrom within, incessantly destroying the old one, incessantly\ncreating a new one. This process of Creative Destruction is the\nessential fact about capitalism. [1942, chap. VII; Schumpeter\u2019s\nemphasis]\n\n\nUnfortunately, economists largely ignored this sort of claim (made\nalso by a few others) until the recent development of economic growth\ntheory (e.g., Robert Solow, Paul Romer, and W. Brian Arthur: see\nBeinhocker 2006 and Warsh 2006). The result was an inability of\neconomic models to account for economic innovation endogenously and,\nthereby, to gain an adequate understanding of the generation of\neconomic wealth.\n\nThe parallel observation holds for philosophy of science. Here, too,\nthe leading philosophers of science until the 1960s\u2014the logical\nempiricists and the Popperians\u2014rejected innovation as a\nlegitimate topic, even though it is the primary intellectual driver of\nscientific change and producer of the wealth of skilled knowledge that\nresults. The general idea is that the so-called context of discovery,\nthe context of creatively constructing new theories, experimental\ndesigns, etc., is only of historical and psychological interest, not\nepistemological interest, and that the latter resides in the epistemic\nstatus of the \u201cfinal products\u201d of investigation. On this\nview, convincing confirmation or refutation of a claim enables\nscientists to render an epistemic judgment that detaches it from its\nhistorical context. This judgment is based on the logical relations of\ntheories and evidence rather than on history or psychology. According\nto this traditional view, there exists a logic of justification but\nnot a logic of discovery. The distinction has nineteenth-century\nantecedents (Laudan 1980). Cohen and Nagel (1934) contended that to\ntake historical path into account as part of the epistemic assessment\nwas to confuse historical questions with logical questions and thereby\nto commit what they called a \u201cgenetic fallacy.\u201d However,\nthe context of discovery / context of justification distinction (or\nfamily of distinctions) is often attributed to Reichenbach (1938).\n(See the entry on\n Reichenbach.\n For recent discussion see Schickore and Steinle, 2006.)\n\nToday there are entire academic industries devoted to various aspects\nof the topic of scientific revolutions, whether political or\nscientific, yet we have no adequate general theory or model of\nrevolutions in either sphere. This article will focus on Thomas\nKuhn\u2019s conception of scientific revolutions, which relies partly\non analogies to political revolution and to religious conversion.\nKuhn\u2019s is by far the most discussed account of scientific\nrevolutions and did much to reshape the field of philosophy of\nscience, given his controversial claims about incommensurability,\nrationality, objectivity, progress, and realism. For a general account\nof Kuhn\u2019s work, see the entry on\n Kuhn.\n See also Hoyningen-Huene (1993), and Bird (2001).\n",
