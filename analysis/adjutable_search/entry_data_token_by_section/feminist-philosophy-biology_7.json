    "main_text": "Conceptual Themes in Feminist Philosophy of Biology || Reductionism\n4.2 Reductionism\n\n\nFeminist analyses of reductionism in biology concern the tendency to\nemploy methods that look for causes and explanations at low levels of\nbiological organization and within the system being studied. This\ncan lead researchers to ignore or undervalue the context in which a\nphenomenon is found, and hence to value genetic and physiological over\nsocial causes, and organismal over environmental factors. This\nview enables arguments for biological determinism, because it supports\nthe idea that the most important causes for a phenomenon, including\nhuman behavior and social organization, are within a person and at the\ngenetic level (Fehr 2004). Within a reductionist framework causes\nbased on environmental influences such as learning and social\nstructures are undervalued.\n\n\nFor example, feminists have scrutinized reductionism with regard to\nthe role of hormones in developmental biology in one of the most\nubiquitous model organisms, rats (Birke 1986, Longino and Doell 1983,\nLongino 1990). In an early model of this system, which Longino\nand Doell called the linear-hormonal model, prenatal and\nperinatal hormone levels are assumed to be the basis for behavioral sex\ndifferences. The assumption was that a gene on the Y chromosome\ntriggers the development of testes, and that the hormones released by\nthese brand new testes affect the structure of the rodent brain during\na critical developmental period. The presence of testes and the\nhormones that they produce were assumed to cause the male brain to\ndevelop such that the male performs \u2018stereotypical\u2019 male\nsexual behavior; in the absence of testes and the hormones that they\nproduce the female brain to develops in such a way as to cause the\nfemale to perform \u2018stereotypical\u2019 female behavior.\nLongino points out that in this explanatory model it is assumed that\nthere is a \u201cunidirectional and irreversible sequence of\n(biochemical) events\u201d (Longino 1990, 135).\n\nBirke writes of this early model:\nEven if it is not always made explicit, the framework\nwithin which this line of reasoning has progressed is that hormones in\nearly life are the prime determinants of adult patterns of sexual\nbehavior. To a large extent this assumption still holds, and the\nexistence of sex differences in behaviour in adults is frequently\nattributed to perinatal hormone effects. Now it may well be true\nthat hormones exert a large effect. The problem is not there, but\nwith the exclusive focus on hormones from the individual's own\ntestes or lack of them which dominated research for several decades\n(Birke 1986, 96).\n\n\nThis is a powerful model because it fits within a reductive\nframework (Fehr 2004). Genes cause anatomical differences, which cause\nhormonal differences, which cause brain differences, which cause\nbehavioral differences. Birke argues that the relationship\nbetween hormones and behavior is much more complicated than this tidy\nreductionist picture implies. She advocates an interactionist\nmodel instead of the linear-hormonal model. She points out\nthat research is beginning to embrace a much more complex picture of\nthe causes of sexual behavior, a picture that involves interactions\namong the mother, the fetus, the physiological and social environment\nas well as the genes, the internal anatomy and the brain structure of\nthe developing fetus. In this model, before birth the pups are\ninfluenced by factors such as the sex of other members of the litter,\nthe mother's environment, and the mother's hormonal\nstates. Birke writes, \u201cEven before birth\u2026 it is\ndifficult to separate the individual pup and its hormones from a\nnetwork of complex processes\u201d (Birke 1986, 97). After birth,\nfactors such as the pup's own hormones, maternal care (which is\ndifferential depending on the sex of the pup), the physical environment\nand the other pups influence adult sexual behavior. When the pup\nbecomes an adult, factors in its physical and social environment as\nwell as its hormonal states and its own behavior influence its sexual\nbehavior. The interactionist model does not ignore low level causes,\nsuch as genes or hormones, it simply refuses to privilege them over\nwhat may be thought of as higher level environmental and social causes\nof behavior. \n\n\nIn this case, feminist analysis shows that uncritically embracing a\nreductive model overlooks other higher-level and environmental causes\nof behavior, and was involved in generating an alternative model that\nwas empirically testable. It is an example of both the critical\nand the constructive sides of feminist philosophy of biology.\nCritiques of reductionism are also common in non-feminist philosophy of\nbiology starting with the work of David Hull (1972,1974) (see the entry\non reductionism in biology for a thorough review).\n",
