    "main_text": "Game Theory and Contractarianism || The Bargaining Problem\n4.1 The Bargaining Problem\n\nAs Gauthier (1986) argues, the bargaining problem provides a framework\nfor a contractarian analysis of the social contract by\nmodeling how parties with partially conflicting interests might arrive\nat a mutually acceptable set of rules they can each follow to their\nown advantage. This contrasts with the contractualist\napproach of Harsanyi (1953, 1955, 1977), Rawls (1958, 1971), and\nScanlon (1982, 1998) that characterizes the social contract as an\nobject of rational choice made under constraints designed to ensure\nthat the choice is appropriately unbiased, and which, in principle,\ncould be made by a single agent. Braithwaite (1955) was the first to\nuse the Nash bargaining problem to derive a social contract, in his\ncase a rule for fairly dividing a resource between two claimants.\nLater, Hampton (1986) and Kavka (1986) argued that the Hobbesian\ndevice of creating a commonwealth by design incorporates\nelements of a Nash bargaining problem. Gauthier (1986) and Binmore\n(1994, 1998) used the Nash bargaining problem for developing\nstandalone theories of distributive justice. More recently, Muldoon\n(2016) and Moehler (2018) have used the Nash bargaining problem to\nmodel the problem of how members of deeply pluralistic societies can\nfind rules for living together peacefully.\n\nNash characterized the bargaining problem as a combination of (i) a\nfeasible set of payoffs that a group of agents might achieve\neach of which is associated with a respective set of actions the\nagents must jointly agree to follow, and (ii) a nonagreement\npoint that specifies what each agent receives in case they fail\nto follow any of these joint action sets. An example of Nash\u2019s\nbargaining problem is the 2-agent Wine Problem depicted in\n Figure 7\n below.\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\nAgent 2 (Laura) \n\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\nD\nH  \n\n\nAgent 1 (Claudia)\nD\n(0,0)\n(0,1) \n\nH\n(1,0)\n(\u22121,\u22121)  \n\n\nD= dove (claim none), H = hawk (claim all)\n\nFigure 7. Wine Problem\n\n\nIn this game Claudia and Laura each have two pure strategies:\nhawk (H), which is to claim an available bottle of\nwine, or dove (D), which is to leave the bottle for\nthe other. The game has two Nash equilibria in pure strategies:\n(H,D), the outcome most favorable to Claudia, and\n(D,H), the outcome most favorable to Laura. If both\ntry to claim the bottle, at the resulting (H,H)\noutcome they fight and neither gets any wine, the worst outcome for\nthem both. The Wine Problem is an example of a conflictual\ncoordination game (Vanderschraaf & Richards 1997), so-called\nbecause it has multiple equilibria, any of which the agents achieve\nonly by coordinating their actions, and where coordination is\ncomplicated by the conflicting preferences of the agents over the\ndifferent available\n equilibria.[1]\n\nOne might think that a natural solution to the Wine Problem is for\nClaudia and Laura to each claim half of the bottle.\n Figure 8\n below thus illustrates an extended version of the Wine Problem in\nwhich each agent now has a third pure strategy, M, in which\nshe claims half the bottle.\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\nAgent 2 (Laura) \n\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\nD\nM\nH  \n\n\nAgent 1 (Claudia)\nD\n\\((0,0)\\)\n\\((0,\\frac{1}{2})\\)\n\\((0,1)\\) \n\nM\n\\((\\frac{1}{2},0)\\)\n\\((\\frac{1}{2},\\frac{1}{2})\\)\n\\(({-1},{-1})\\) \n\nH\n\\((1,0)\\)\n\\(({-1},{-1})\\)\n\\(({-1},{-1})\\)  \n\n\nD = dove (claim none), M = moderate (claim half),\nH = hawk (claim all)\n\nFigure 8. Extended Wine Problem\n\n\nIn this game, Laura and Claudia each receives the amount of wine she\nclaims if their claims are compatible, that is, if there is\nenough wine to satisfy each claim. However, if their claims are\nincompatible, they fight. There is now a new Nash equilibrium\nin pure strategies, \\((M,M)\\), where Laura and Claudia each receive\nhalf the bottle. It\u2019s not a foregone conclusion that they will\nsettle into \\((M,M)\\), though, for \\((H,D)\\) and \\((D,H)\\) remain\nequilibria, and the former continues to be most preferred by Claudia,\nand the latter most preferred by Laura.\n\nFurthermore, if each can claim half the bottle why should they not be\nable to claim other shares?\n Figure 9\n below summarizes the bargaining problem that arises when Claudia can\nclaim any share \\(x_1\\) of the wine and Laura can similarly claim any\nshare \\(x_2\\).\n\n\n\nFigure 9. Wine Bargaining Problem [An\n extended description of figure 9\n is in the supplement.]\n\n\nHere Claudia\u2019s payoffs are depicted on the horizontal axis, and\nLaura\u2019s payoffs are depicted in the vertical axis. The green\nshaded region represents the feasible set of payoff vectors\n\\(\\Lambda\\) where Laura and Claudia make compatible claims, that is\nwhere \\(x_1 +x_2 \\le 1.\\) While the payoff vector \\(\\bu_0 =\n({-1},{-1})\\) corresponding to the (H,H) outcome\nrepresents their nonagreement point.\n\nIn the social contract context we can think of the nonagreement point\n\\(\\bu_0\\) as representing the State of Nature, and the feasible set\n\\(\\Lambda\\) as representative of the various contracts parties might\nagree to. Each point \\(\\bu \\in \\Lambda\\) that is weakly Pareto\nsuperior to \\(\\bu_0\\) thus characterizes a social contract with a\ncooperative surplus (Gauthier 1986:\n 141).[2]\n And, when a set of claims constitutes an equilibrium solution to the\nassociated bargaining problem, this allows us to say that the parties\nto a contract all have good reason to comply with its terms. As we\nwill see below, though, there are various approaches to identifying\nthe most attractive equilibrium from a normative point of view. An\nadvantage of using the Nash bargaining approach to modeling the social\ncontract, then, is that this formalization helps to clarify the\ndifferences between these\n approaches.[3]\n\nThe Basis Game that Braithwaite analyzed in his Cambridge lecture is\nideal for illustrating the axiomatic approach to the bargaining\nproblem. In this game two agents, Luke and Matthew, vie for shares of\na limited resource. Like the Wine Problem, the Braithwaite Basis Game\nis a conflictual coordination game in which each agent has two pure\nstrategies available, H in which the agent claims all of the\ngood at stake, and D in which he claims none. Here\n(H,D) is the Nash equilibrium most favorable to Luke\nand (D,H) is the equilibrium most favorable to\nMatthew. As\n Figure 10\n illustrates, though, this game has asymmetries not present in the\nWine\n Problem.[4]\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\nAgent 2 (Matthew) \n\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\nD\nH  \n\n\nAgent 1 (Luke)\nD\n\\((\\frac{1}{6},0)\\)\n\\((\\frac{1}{2},1)\\) \n\nH\n\\((1,\\frac{2}{9})\\)\n\\((0,\\frac{1}{9})\\)  \n\n\nD= dove (claim none), H = hawk (claim all)\n\nFigure 10. Braithwaite Basis Game\n\n\nAgain, as before, this game can be extended to accommodate the case\nwhere agents can claim shares of the good. And if the nonagreement\npoint again results in the payoffs generated by the conflict outcome\n(H, H), as Braithwaite supposed, then Matthew and\nLuke are in a Nash bargaining problem with feasible set \\(\\Lambda\\)\nand nonagreement point \\(\\bu_0 = \\left(0,\\frac{1}{9}\\right)\\).\n Figure 11\n depicts the feasible set \\(\\Lambda\\) for such a game (again shaded in\ngreen). This time, though, the figure also identifies the payoff\nvectors associated with three solutions concepts that have been\nespecially influential in in game theoretic analyses of the social\ncontract (namely the Nash, proportional, and\nmaximin proportionate gain solutions).\n\n\n\nFigure 11. Braithwaite Bargaining\nProblem [An\n extended description of figure 11\n is in the supplement.]\n\n\nHere Luke\u2019s payoffs are depicted on the horizontal axis, while\nMatthew\u2019s are on the vertical axis. As we can see, although the\nsolutions differ, each leaves Matthew with a higher payoff than Luke\nreceives. This is because each solution allocates Matthew a larger\nshare of the\n good,[5]\n and is due to the asymmetry in the nonagreement point that\ncharacterizes the Braithwaite Problem. Specifically, (H,\nH) is Luke\u2019s worst possible outcome, but not\nMatthew\u2019s, so Matthew has a threat advantage. In less\ntechnical terms, because failing to agree is less bad for Matthew he\ncan use the threat of nonagreement to press for an agreement that is\nmore favorable to him. And this asymmetry distinguishes the\nBraithwaite Bargaining Problem from the Wine Division Problem depicted\nin\n Figure 9\n where the three solutions coincide with the point \\(\\bu^{*} =\n\\left(\\frac{1}{2}, \\frac{1}{2}\\right)\\) in which the agents involved\neach receive equal shares.\n\nIn his own analysis Braithwaite favored the proportional\nsolution to the bargaining problem that selects the point on the\nPareto frontier where the payoffs for each agent relative to the\nnonagreement point are proportionate to some independently specified\nmeasure of fair\n gains.[6]\n Gauthier (1986, 2013), on the other hand, defends the maximin\nproportionate gain solution that also selects a point on the\nPareto frontier by comparing the payoffs for agents relative to the\nnonagreement point, but which, in addition, takes into account how\nagents fare relative to their ideal\n payoffs.[7]\n In the game theory literature, however, the Nash solution\nhas remained the most widely utilized solution concept, and this has\narguably been true among philosophers offering game-theoretic\ntreatments of the social contract as well (see, e.g., Binmore 1994,\n1998; Muldoon 2016). Roughly speaking, this solution picks out the\npoint that maximizes the cooperative surplus, although some\nphilosophers have offered refinements on the concept that guarantee\npayoffs also meet a minimum threshold (Moehler\n 2018).[8]\n\nAt the heart of debates utilizing game-theoretic treatments of the\nsocial contract is the fact that each of the solution concepts\nmentioned above, and indeed any solution to the bargaining problem,\nmight satisfy several but not all of the intuitively\nplausible constraints we might want ]a fair bargaining procedure to\nrealize. For instance, Nash\u2019s solution is the only solution\nconcept that satisfies all four of:\n\nPareto optimality,\nsymmetry,\nscale (or utility) invariance, and\nreapplication\n stability.[9]\n\n\nBut it fails to satisfy both:\n\nindividual monotonicity, and\npopulation monotonicity.\n\n\nIn this context, an outcome (or its associated payoff vector) is\nPareto optimal if there are no other outcomes that are better for some\nagents without being worse for\n others.[10]\n A solution is symmetric if the payoffs that agents receive from\nidentical shares of a good are equivalent when those agents have\nequivalent utility functions, nonagreement points, and\n strategies.[11]\n It is scale invariant if the solution does not depend on how the\npayoffs are\n represented.[12]\n And it is reapplication stable if the application of a solution\nconcept to a bargaining problem does not generate downstream\nbargaining problems among subsets of agents over the relative shares\nof a good they can\n claim.[13]\n While a solution is individually monotone if an agent is guaranteed\nto do at least as well when a bargaining problem is modified by\nexpanding the feasible set to include new outcomes that are all more\nfavorable to the agent. And it is population monotone if, for a given\nset of claimants, none lose while others gain merely because some\nmembers of the set depart and/or new claimants arrive.\n\nThe maximin proportionate gain solution, on the other hand, is both\nindividually and population monotone, but is not reapplication stable.\nWhile the proportional solution is individually monotone, population\nmonotone, and reapplication stable, but not scale invariant.\nUltimately, then, much like\n Arrow\u2019s Impossibility Theorem\n and related results have cast doubt on whether there exist uniquely\nbest procedures for aggregating preferences or making collective\ndecisions, there is not a single solution concept for bargaining\nproblems that is clearly best. That said, the application of\nbargaining theory to philosophical analyses of the social contract has\nbeen useful insofar as it has provided a framework for illustrating\nwhat features of a social contract a theorist regards as valuable, and\nfor identifying what the tradeoffs associated with these features\nmight be. So, for example, one might conjecture that the reapplication\nstability properties associated with the Nash and proportional\nsolution concepts would allow a social contract based upon one of them\nto be better suited to forestalling conflict in the face of social\nchange. This is because such a contract would be renegotiation-proof\nwith respect to changes in the benefits of cooperation that might\narise in the future, e.g., as a result of an influx of new members in\nsociety or the discovery of new technologies for resource development.\nBut this stability would have to come at the price of either using a\nprivileged representation of agent\u2019s payoffs, or accepting that\nthe parties to the contract will not necessarily be made better off if\nthey are given more to bargain over. And while this tradeoff may\nultimately be justified, the important point is that any tradeoff the\ncontract theorist makes commits her to a certain set of normative\njudgments, and game theory can help clarify what these are. For\ninstance, many game theoretically minded philosophers have contended\nthat any account that privileges certain representations of\nagents\u2019 utilities cannot avoid incorporating certain moral\njudgments into these utilities (Sen 1980; Moehler 2018).\n",
