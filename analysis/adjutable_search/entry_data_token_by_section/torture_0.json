    "main_text": "Definition of Torture\n1. Definition of Torture\n\nTorture includes such practices as searing with hot irons, burning at\nthe stake, electric shock treatment to the genitals, cutting out parts\nof the body, e.g., tongue, entrails or genitals, severe beatings,\nsuspending by the legs with arms tied behind back, applying\nthumbscrews, inserting a needle under the fingernails, drilling\nthrough an unanesthetized tooth, making a person crouch for hours in\nthe \u2018Z\u2019 position, waterboarding (submersion in water or\ndousing to produce the sensation of drowning), and denying food, water\nor sleep for days or weeks on\n end.[3]\n There is a dispute in relation to how extreme the infliction of\nphysical suffering needs to be before it counts as torture and,\ndoubtless, there is a continuum here. For an attempt to make some\ndistinctions in this area see Lauritzen 2013. (For detailed\ndescriptions in a variety of recent and not so recent settings\nincluding in policing and in prisons, see Wickersham 1931, Murton\n& Hyams 1969, Nagel 1978, Landau 1987, Bybee 2002, Public\nCommission Against Torture in Israel (2003), Levinson 2004,\nGreenberg & Dratel 2005, Gross 2009, Clucas et al. 2009,\nFeitlowitz 2011 and Rejali 2007.)\n\n\nAll of these practices presuppose that the torturer has control over\nthe victim\u2019s body, e.g., the victim is strapped to a chair.\n\nMost of these practices, but not all of them, involve the infliction\nof extreme physical pain. For example, sleep deprivation does not\nnecessarily involve the infliction of extreme physical pain.\nHowever, all of these practices involve the infliction of extreme\nphysical suffering, e.g., exhaustion in the case of sleep\ndeprivation. Indeed, all of them involve the intentional\ninfliction of extreme physical suffering on some\nnon-consenting and defenceless person. If A\naccidentally sears B with hot irons A has\nnot tortured B; intention is a necessary condition for\ntorture. Further, if A intentionally sears B with\nhot irons and B consented to this action, then B has\nnot been tortured. Indeed, even if B did not consent, but\nB could have physically prevented A from searing him\nthen B has not been tortured. That is, in order for it to be\nan instance of torture, B has to be\n defenceless.[4]\n\nIs the intentional infliction of extreme mental suffering on\na non-consenting, defenceless person necessarily torture? Michael\nDavis thinks not (2005: 163). Assume that B\u2019s friend,\nA, is being tortured, e.g., A is undergoing electric\nshock treatment, but that B himself is untouched \u2013 albeit\nB is imprisoned in the room adjoining the torture chamber.\n(Alternatively, assume that B is in a hotel room in another\ncountry and live sounds and images of the torture are intentionally\ntransmitted to him in his room by the torturer in such a way that he\ncannot avoid seeing and hearing them other than by leaving the room\nafter having already seen and heard them.) However, A is\nbeing tortured for the purpose of causing B to disclose\ncertain information to the torturer. B is certainly\nundergoing extreme mental suffering. Nevertheless, B is\nsurely not himself being tortured. To see this, reflect on the\nfollowing revised version of the scenario. Assume that A is\nnot in fact being tortured; rather the \u2018torturer\u2019 is only\npretending to torture A. However, B believes that\nA is being tortured; so B\u2019s mental suffering\nis as in the original scenario. In this revised version of the\nscenario the \u2018torturer\u2019 is not torturing A. In\nthat case surely he is not torturing B\n either.[5]\n\nOn the other hand, it might be argued that some instances of\nthe intentional infliction of extreme mental suffering on\nnon-consenting, defenceless persons are cases of torture, albeit some\ninstances (such as the above one) are not. Consider, for example, a\nmock execution or a situation in which a victim with an extreme rat\nphobia lies naked on the ground with his arms and legs tied to stakes\nwhile dozens of rats are placed all over his body and face. The\ndifference between the mock execution and the phobia scenario on the\none hand, and the above case of the person being made to believe that\nhis friend is being tortured on the other hand, is that in the latter\ncase the mental suffering is at one remove; it is suffering caused by\nsomeone else\u2019s (believed) suffering. However, such suffering at\none remove is in general less palpable, and more able to be resisted\nand subjected to rational control; after all, it is not my\nbody that is being electrocuted, my life that is being\nthreatened, or my uncontrollable extreme fear of rats that is\nbeing experienced. An exception to this general rule might be cases\ninvolving the torture of persons with whom the sufferer at one remove\nhas an extremely close relationship and a very strong felt duty of\ncare, e.g. a child and its parent. At any rate, if as appears to be\nthe case, there are some cases of mental torture then the above\ndefinition will need to be extended, albeit in a manner that does not\nadmit all cases of the infliction of extreme mental suffering\nas being instances of torture.\n\nIn various national and international laws, e.g., Convention against\nTorture and Other Cruel, Inhuman and Degrading Treatment or Punishment\n(United Nations 1984 \u2013 see Other Internet Resources), a\ndistinction is made between torture and inhumane treatment, albeit\ntorture is a species of inhumane treatment. Such a distinction needs\nto be made. For one thing, some treatment, e.g., flogging, might be\ninhumane without being sufficiently extreme to count as torture. For\nanother thing, some inhumane treatment does not involve physical\nsuffering to any great extent, and is therefore not torture, properly\nspeaking (albeit, the treatment in question may be as morally bad as,\nor even morally worse than, torture). Some forms of the infliction of\nmental suffering are a case in point, as are some forms of morally\ndegrading treatment, e.g., causing a prisoner to pretend to have sex\nwith an animal.\n\nSo torture is the intentional infliction of extreme physical suffering\non some non-consenting, defenceless person. Is this an adequate\ndefinition of torture? Perhaps not, albeit some theorists, such as\nKamm (2011), adhere to this kind of conception. Consider the following\nimaginary counter-example. A woman who is being raped but who is,\nnevertheless, still in control of the movement of her jaws sinks her\nteeth into the face of her attacker causing him excruciating pain\nagainst which he is defenceless, until finally he desists. Surely the\nwoman is not torturing her attacker but rather defending herself by\ninflicting excruciating pain on her attacker. Evidently what is\nmissing in the account thus far is the relationship between torture\nand autonomy: torture substantially curtails autonomy\n\nSo torture is: (a) the intentional infliction of extreme physical\nsuffering on some non-consenting, defenceless person, and; (b) the\nintentional, substantial curtailment of the exercise of the\nperson\u2019s autonomy (achieved by means of (a)). Is this now an\nadequate definition of torture? Perhaps not.\n\nHere we need to consider the purpose or point of torture.\n\nThe above-mentioned U.N. Convention identifies four reasons for\ntorture, namely: (1) to obtain a confession; (2) to obtain\ninformation; (3) to punish; (4) to coerce the sufferer or others to\nact in certain ways. Certainly, these are all possible purposes of\ntorture, as is torture performed for sadistic\n pleasure.[6]\n However, in the contemporary the concern is principally with\ninterrogational torture; torture to obtain information (Skerker\n2010; Lauritzen 2013).\n\n\nIt seems that in general torture is undertaken for the\npurpose of breaking the victim\u2019s\n will.[7]\n If true, this distinguishes torture for the sake of breaking the\nvictim\u2019s will from the other four purposes mentioned above. For\nwith respect to each one of these four purposes, it is not the case\nthat in general torture is undertaken for that purpose, e.g.,\nin most contemporary societies torture is not generally undertaken for\nthe purpose of punishing the victim.\n\nOne consideration in favour of the proposition that breaking the\nvictim\u2019s will is a purpose central to the practice of torture is\nthat achieving the purpose of breaking the victim\u2019s will is very\noften a necessary condition for the achievement of the other four\nidentified purposes (and, indeed, for the achievement of sadistic\npleasure). In the case of interrogatory torture of an enemy spy, for\nexample, in order to obtain the desired information the torturer must\nfirst break the will of the victim. And when torture \u2013 as opposed\nto, for example, flogging as a form of corporal punishment \u2013 is\nused as a form of punishment it typically has as a proximate, and in\npart constitutive, purpose to break the victim\u2019s will. Hence\ntorture as punishment does not consist \u2013 as do other forms of\npunishment \u2013 of a determinate set of specific, pre-determined and\npublicly known acts administered over a definite and limited time\nperiod.\n\nA second consideration is as follows. We have seen that torture\ninvolves substantially curtailing the victim\u2019s autonomy.\nHowever, to substantially curtail someone\u2019s autonomy is not\nnecessarily to break their will. Consider the torture victim who holds\nout and refuses to confess or provide the information sought by the\ntorturer. Nevertheless, a proximate logical endpoint of the process of\ncurtailing the exercise of a person\u2019s autonomy is the breaking\nof their will, at least for a time and in relation to certain\nmatters.\n\nThese two considerations taken together render it plausible that in\ngeneral torture has as a purpose to break the victim\u2019s will.\n\nSo perhaps the following definition is adequate. Torture is: (a) the\nintentional infliction of extreme physical suffering on some\nnon-consenting, defenceless person; (b) the intentional, substantial\ncurtailment of the exercise of the person\u2019s autonomy (achieved\nby means of (a)); (c) in general, undertaken for the purpose\nof breaking the victim\u2019s will.\n\nNote that breaking a person\u2019s will is short of entirely\ndestroying or subsuming their autonomy. Sussman implausibly holds the\nlatter to be definitive of torture: \u201cThe victim of torture finds\nwithin herself a surrogate of the torturer, a surrogate who does not\nmerely advance a particular demand for information, denunciation or\nconfession. Rather, the victim\u2019s whole perspective is given over\nto that surrogate, to the extent that the only thing that matters to\nher is pleasing this other person who appears infinitely distant,\nimportant, inscrutable, powerful and free. The will of the torturer is\nthus cast as something like the source of all value in his\nvictim\u2019s world\u201d (Sussman 2005: 26). (See also Bernstein\n2015.) Such self-abnegation might be the purpose of some forms of\ntorture, as indeed it is of some forms of slavery and brainwashing,\nbut it is certainly not definitive of torture.\n\nConsider victims of torture who are able to resist so that their wills\nare not broken. An example from the history of Australian policing is\nthat of the notorious criminal and hard-man, James Finch: \u201cHe\n[Finch] was handcuffed to a chair and we knocked the shit out of him.\nSiddy Atkinson was pretty fit then and gave him a terrible\nhiding\u2026.no matter what we did to Finch, the bastard\nwouldn\u2019t talk\u201d (Stannard 1988: 40). Again, consider the\nfamous case of Steve Biko who it seems was prepared to die rather than\nallow his torturers to break his will (Arnold 1984:\n 281\u20132).[8]\n\nHere breaking a person\u2019s will can be understood in a minimalist\nor a maximalist sense. This is not to say that the boundaries between\nthese two senses can be sharply drawn.\n\nUnderstood in its minimal sense, breaking a person\u2019s will is\ncausing that person to abandon autonomous decision-making in relation\nto some narrowly circumscribed area of life and for a limited\n period.[9]\n Consider, for example, a thief deciding to disclose or not disclose\nto the police torturing him where he has hidden the goods he has\nstolen (a torturing practice frequently used by police in\n India).[10]\n Suppose further that he knows that he can only be legally held in\ncustody for a twenty-four hour period, and that the police are not\nable to infringe this particular law. By torturing the thief the\npolice might break his will and, against his will, cause him to\ndisclose the whereabouts of the stolen goods.\n\nUnderstood in its maximal sense, breaking a person\u2019s will\ninvolves reaching the endpoint of the kind of process Sussman\ndescribes above, i.e., the point at which the victim\u2019s will is\nsubsumed by the will of the torturer. Winston Smith in George\nOrwell\u2019s 1984 is, as Sussman notes, an instance of the\nlatter extreme endpoint of some processes of torture. Smith ends up\nwillingly betraying what is dearest and most important to him, i.e.,\nhis loved one Julia.\n\nMoreover, there are numerous examples of long term damage to\nindividual autonomy and identity caused by torture, to some extent\nirrespective of whether the victim\u2019s will was broken. For\nexample, some victims of prolonged torture in prisons in authoritarian\nstates are so psychologically damaged that even when released they are\nunable to function as normal adult persons, i.e. as rational choosers\npursuing their projects in a variety of standard interpersonal\ncontexts such as work and family.\n\nGiven the above definition of torture (elaborated in Miller 2005 and\n2009), we can distinguish torture from the following practices.\n\nFirstly, we need to distinguish torture from coercion. In the case of\ncoercion, people are coerced into doing what they don\u2019t want to\ndo. This is consistent with their retaining control over their actions\nand making a rational decision to, say, hand over their wallet when\ntold to do so by a robber who threatens to shoot them dead (albeit\npainlessly) if they don\u2019t do so. As this example shows, coercion\ndoes not necessarily involve the infliction of physical suffering (or\nthreat thereof). So coercion does not necessarily involve torture. Nor\ndoes coercion, which does involve the infliction of physical suffering\nas a means, necessarily constitute torture. Consider, for example, a\nSouth African police officer in the days of apartheid who used a\ncattle prodder which delivers an electric shock on contact as a means\nof controlling an unruly crowd of South African blacks. Presumably,\nthis is not torture because the members of the crowd are not under the\npolice officer\u2019s control; specifically, they are not defenceless\nin the face of the cattle prodder. On the other hand, if \u2013 as also\nevidently took place in apartheid South Africa \u2013 a person was tied\nto a chair and thereby rendered defenceless, and then subjected to\nrepeated electric shocks from a cattle prodder this would constitute\ntorture.\n\nDoes torture necessarily involve coercion? No doubt the threat of\ntorture, and torture in its preliminary stages, simply functions as a\nform of coercion in this sense. However, torture proper has as its\nstarting point the failure of coercion, or that coercion is not even\ngoing to be attempted. As we have seen, torture proper targets\nautonomy itself, and seeks to overwhelm the capacity of the victims to\nexercise rational control over their decisions \u2013 at least in\nrelation to certain matters for a limited period of time \u2013 by\nliterally terrorising them into submission. Hence there is a close\naffinity between terrorism and torture. Indeed, arguably torture is a\nterrorist tactic. However, it is one that can be used by groups other\nthan terrorists, e.g., it can be used against enemy combatants by\narmies fighting conventional wars and deploying conventional military\nstrategies. In relation to the claim that torture is not coercion, it\nmight be responded that at least some forms or instances of torture\ninvolve coercion, namely those in which the torturer is seeking\nsomething from the victim, e.g., information, and in which some degree\nof rational control to comply or not with the torturer\u2019s wishes\nis retained by the victim. This response is plausible. However, even\nif the response is accepted, there will remain instances of torture in\nwhich these above-mentioned conditions do not obtain; presumably,\nthese will not be instances of coercion.\n\nSecondly, torture needs to be distinguished from excruciatingly\npainful medical procedures. Consider the case of a rock-climber who\namputates a fellow climber\u2019s arm, which got caught in a crevice\nin an isolated and inhospitable mountain area. These kinds of case\ndiffer from torture in a number of respects. For example, such medical\nprocedures are consensual and not undertaken to break some\npersons\u2019 will, but rather to promote their physical wellbeing or\neven to save their life.\n\nThirdly, there is corporal punishment. Corporal punishment is, or\nought to be, administered only to persons who have committed some\nlegal and/or moral offence for the purpose of punishing them. By\ncontrast, torture is not \u2013 as is corporal punishment \u2013 limited\nby normative definition to the guilty; and in general torture, but not\ncorporal punishment, has as its purpose the breaking of a\nperson\u2019s will. Moreover, unlike torture, corporal punishment\nwill normally consist of a determinate set of specific, pre-determined\nand publicly known acts administered during a definite and limited\ntime period, e.g., ten lashes of the cat-o-nine-tails for theft.\n\nFourthly, there are ordeals involving the infliction of severe pain.\nConsider Gordon Liddy who reportedly held his hand over a burning\ncandle till his flesh burnt in order to test his will. Ordeals have as\ntheir primary purpose to test a person\u2019s will, but are not\nundertaken to break a person\u2019s will. Moreover, ordeals \u2013 as\nthe Liddy example illustrates \u2013 can be voluntary, unlike\ntorture.\n\nHaving provided ourselves with an analytic account of torture and\ndistinguished torture from some closely related practices, we need to\nturn now to the question, What is Wrong with Torture?\n",
