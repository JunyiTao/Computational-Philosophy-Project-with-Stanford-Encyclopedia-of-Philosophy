    "main_text": "Contemporary Theories of Territory || Ethnogeographic Group Theory of territory\n3.5 Ethnogeographic Group Theory of territory\n\nAvery Kolers, in his book Land, Conflict and Justice, puts\nforward a theory of territory that has the same structure as\nnationalist theories, in linking (unstructured) groups with land first\nand then describing the state later, but he identifies the territorial\nright-holding group as an \u2018ethnogeographic community\u2019\nrather than a nation. By this term, Kolers means a group of people\nthat (i) share a specific social ontology of land, and he clarifies\nthat this means \u201ca culturally specific conception of land, what\nland is, what about it is valuable\u201d (Kolers 2009: 3\u20134) and\n(ii) a specific material relationship with land, so that the community\nin question is characterized by pervasive material interaction between\nthe land and the community. The two criteria\u2014one subjective, the\nother objective\u2014are somewhat different, since the former seems to\ninclude cultural significance and meanings, whereas the latter tracks\neconomic and functional considerations. However, as Kolers notes,\nthere are reasons to believe that our ideas about land often reflect\nour material interests and material relationship with it. In his\nexamples, most cases exemplify both conditions. As these can come\napart, we could suppose that they are jointly necessary and sufficient\nconditions.\n\nKolers\u2019 theory appeals to the notion of \u2018plenitude\u2019\nto explain how a group can be attached to an area, and this seems like\nit ought to be able to adjudicate rival claims, and potentially limit\nthe scope of territorial rights. Plenitude, for Kolers, involves (1)\ninternal diversity, (2) external distinctness, each from the\nperspective of the claimants, and (3) feasible plans for maintaining\nthese in perpetuity (Kolers 2009: 115). Plenitude is claimed to be\nvalue-neutral in the sense that it does not rest on a normatively\ncontested theory of appropriate use, and is compatible with an\necologically sensitive commitment to keeping some areas in their\nnatural state without reverting to common ownership in the sense of a\nlibertarian free-for-all. \n\nHowever, since \u2018plenitude\u2019 has a number of different\ndimensions, it\u2019s not clear that it represents an authoritative\nmechanism to decide between rival claims. More than one group can make\nclaims on those bases to the same piece of land. What if one group\nrecognizes its internal diversity and a different group its external\ndifferentiation? What if neither has feasible plans for maintaining\nthem in perpetuity? Since this is not a single criterion at all, but\nembodies at least three different requirements, it\u2019s possible\nthat all could be met by more than one group, or that some elements\ncould be met different groups. Unfortunately, Kolers does not indicate\nwhat to do in this situation, which means that Kolers\u2019 theory is\nless precise in addressing rival claims and conflict than it initially\nseems to be. \n",
