In the previous section we have seen that Kettlewell\u2019s\nexperiments both test and confirm a theory. I discussed earlier a set\nof crucial experiments that decided between two competing classes of\ntheories, those that conserved parity and those that did not. In this\nsection I will discuss an experiment that decided among three\ncompeting mechanisms for the replication of DNA, the molecule now\nbelieved to be responsible for heredity. This is another crucial\nexperiment. It strongly supported one proposed mechanism and argued\nagainst the other two. (For details of this episode see Holmes\n2001.)\n\nIn 1953 Francis Crick and James Watson proposed a three-dimensional\nstructure for deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) (Watson and Crick 1953a).\nTheir proposed structure consisted of two polynucleotide chains\nhelically wound about a common axis. This was the famous \u201cDouble\nHelix\u201d. The chains were bound together by combinations of four\nnitrogen bases \u2014 adenine, thymine, cytosine, and guanine.\nBecause of structural requirements only the base pairs adenine-thymine\nand cytosine-guanine are allowed. Each chain is thus complementary to\nthe other. If there is an adenine base at a location in one chain\nthere is a thymine base at the same location on the other chain, and\nvice versa. The same applies to cytosine and guanine. The order of the\nbases along a chain is not, however, restricted in any way, and it is\nthe precise sequence of bases that carries the genetic\ninformation.\n\nThe significance of the proposed structure was not lost on Watson and\nCrick when they made their suggestion. They remarked, \u201cIt has\nnot escaped our notice that the specific pairing we have postulated\nimmediately suggests a possible copying mechanism for the genetic\nmaterial.\u201d\n\nIf DNA was to play this crucial role in genetics, then there must be a\nmechanism for the replication of the molecule. Within a short period\nof time following the Watson-Crick suggestion, three different\nmechanisms for the replication of the DNA molecule were proposed\n(Delbruck and Stent 1957). These are illustrated in Figure A. The\nfirst, proposed by Gunther Stent and known as conservative\nreplication, suggested that each of the two strands of the parent DNA\nmolecule is replicated in new material. This yields a first generation\nwhich consists of the original parent DNA molecule and one\nnewly-synthesized DNA molecule. The second generation will consist of\nthe parental DNA and three new DNAs.\n\n\n\nFigure A: Possible mechanisms for DNA\nreplication. (Left) Conservative replication. Each of the two strands\nof the parent DNA is replicated to yield the unchanged parent DNA and\none newly synthesized DNA. The second generation consists of one\nparent DNA and three new DNAs. (Center) Semiconservative replication.\nEach first generation DNA molecule contains one strand of the parent\nDNA and one newly synthesized strand. The second generation consists\nof two hybrid DNAs and two new DNAs. (Right) Dispersive replication.\nThe parent chains break at intervals, and the parental segments\ncombine with new segments to form the daughter chains. The darker\nsegments are parental DNA and the lighter segments are newly\nsynthesized DNA. From Lehninger (1975).\n\n\nThe second proposed mechanism, known as semiconservative replication\nis when each strand of the parental DNA acts as a template for a\nsecond newly-synthesized complementary strand, which then combines\nwith the original strand to form a DNA molecule. This was proposed by\nWatson and Crick (1953b). The first generation consists of two hybrid\nmolecules, each of which contains one strand of parental DNA and one\nnewly synthesized strand. The second generation consists of two hybrid\nmolecules and two totally new DNAs. The third mechanism, proposed by\nMax Delbruck, was dispersive replication, in which the parental DNA\nchains break at intervals and the parental segments combine with new\nsegments to form the daughter strands.\n\nIn this section the experiment performed by Matthew Meselson and\nFranklin Stahl, which has been called \u201cthe most beautiful\nexperiment in biology\u201d, and which was designed to answer the\nquestion of the correct DNA replication mechanism will be discussed\n(Meselson and Stahl 1958). Meselson and Stahl described their proposed\nmethod. \u201cWe anticipated that a label which imparts to the DNA\nmolecule an increased density might permit an analysis of this\ndistribution by sedimentation techniques. To this end a method was\ndeveloped for the detection of small density differences among\nmacromolecules. By use of this method, we have observed the\ndistribution of the heavy nitrogen isotope \\(\\ce{^{15}N}\\) among\nmolecules of DNA following the transfer of a uniformly\n\\(\\ce{^{15}N}\\)-labeled, exponentially growing bacterial population to\na growth medium containing the ordinary nitrogen isotope\n\\(\\ce{^{14}N}\\)\u201d (Meselson and Stahl 1958, pp.\n671\u2013672).\n\n\n\nFigure B: Schematic representation of\nthe Meselson-Stahl experiment. From Watson (1965).\n\n\nThe experiment is described schematically in Figure B. Meselson and\nStahl placed a sample of DNA in a solution of cesium chloride. As the\nsample is rotated at high speed the denser material travels further\naway from the axis of rotation than does the less dense material. This\nresults in a solution of cesium chloride that has increasing density\nas one goes further away from the axis of rotation. The DNA reaches\nequilibrium at the position where its density equals that of the\nsolution. Meselson and Stahl grew E. coli bacteria in a\nmedium that contained ammonium chloride \\((\\ce{NH4Cl})\\) as the sole\nsource of nitrogen. They did this for media that contained either\n\\(\\ce{^{14}N}\\), ordinary nitrogen, or \\(\\ce{^{15}N}\\), a heavier\nisotope. By destroying the cell membranes they could obtain samples of\nDNA which contained either \\(\\ce{^{14}N}\\) or \\(\\ce{^{15}N}\\). They\nfirst showed that they could indeed separate the two different mass\nmolecules of DNA by centrifugation (Figure C). The separation of the\ntwo types of DNA is clear in both the photograph obtained by absorbing\nultraviolet light and in the graph showing the intensity of the\nsignal, obtained with a densitometer. In addition, the separation\nbetween the two peaks suggested that they would be able to distinguish\nan intermediate band composed of hybrid DNA from the heavy and light\nbands. These early results argued both that the experimental apparatus\nwas working properly and that all of the results obtained were\ncorrect. It is difficult to imagine either an apparatus malfunction or\na source of experimental background that could reproduce those\nresults. This is similar, although certainly not identical, to\nGalileo\u2019s observation of the moons of Jupiter or to\nMillikan\u2019s measurement of the charge of the electron. In both of\nthose episodes it was the results themselves that argued for their\ncorrectness.\n\n\n\nFigure C: The separation of\n\\(\\ce{^{14}N}\\) DNA from \\(\\ce{^{15}N}\\) DNA by centrifugation. The\nband on the left is \\(\\ce{^{14}N}\\) DNA and that on the right is from\n\\(\\ce{^{15}N}\\) DNA. From Meselson and Stahl (1958).\n\n\nMeselson and Stahl then produced a sample of E coli bacteria\ncontaining only \\(\\ce{^{15}N}\\) by growing it in a medium containing\nonly ammonium chloride with \\(\\ce{^{15}N}\\) \\((\\ce{^{15}NH4Cl})\\) for\nfourteen generations. They then abruptly changed the medium to\n\\(\\ce{^{14}N}\\) by adding a tenfold excess of \\(\\ce{^{14}NH_4Cl}\\).\nSamples were taken just before the addition of \\(\\ce{^{14}N}\\) and at\nintervals afterward for several generations. The cell membranes were\nbroken to release the DNA into the solution and the samples were\ncentrifuged and ultraviolet absorption photographs taken. In addition,\nthe photographs were scanned with a recording densitometer. The\nresults are shown in Figure D, showing both the photographs and the\ndensitometer traces. The figure shows that one starts only with heavy\n(fully-labeled) DNA. As time proceeds one sees more and more\nhalf-labeled DNA, until at one generation time only half-labeled DNA\nis present. \u201cSubsequently only half labeled DNA and completely\nunlabeled DNA are found. When two generation times have elapsed after\nthe addition of \\(\\ce{^{14}N}\\) half-labeled and unlabeled DNA are\npresent in equal amounts\u201d (p. 676). (This is exactly what the\nsemiconservative replication mechanism predicts). By four generations\nthe sample consists almost entirely of unlabeled DNA. A test of the\nconclusion that the DNA in the intermediate density band was half\nlabeled was provided by examination of a sample containing equal\namounts of generations 0 and 1.9. If the semiconservative mechanism is\ncorrect then Generation 1.9 should have approximately equal amounts of\nunlabeled and half-labeled DNA, whereas Generation 0 contains only\nfully-labeled DNA. As one can see, there are three clear density bands\nand Meselson and Stahl found that the intermediate band was centered\nat \\((50 \\pm 2)\\) percent of the difference between the\n\\(\\ce{^{14}N}\\) and \\(\\ce{^{15}N}\\) bands, shown in the bottom\nphotograph (Generations 0 and 4.1). This is precisely what one would\nexpect if that DNA were half labeled.\n\n\n\nFigure D: (Left) Ultraviolet absorption\nphotographs showing DNA bands from centrifugation of DNA from E.\nColi sampled at various times after the addition of an excess of\n\\(\\ce{^{14}N}\\) substrates to a growing \\(\\ce{^{15}N}\\) culture.\n(Right) Densitometer traces of the photographs. The initial sample is\nall heavy (\\(\\ce{^{15}N}\\) DNA). As time proceeds a second\nintermediate band begins to appear until at one generation all of the\nsample is of intermediate mass (Hybrid DNA). At longer times a band of\nlight DNA appears, until at 4.1 generations the sample is almost all\nlighter DNA. This is exactly what is predicted by the Watson-Crick\nsemiconservative mechanism. From Meselson and Stahl (1958)\n\n\nMeselson and Stahl stated their results as follows, \u201cThe\nnitrogen of DNA is divided equally between two subunits which remain\nintact through many generations\u2026. Following replication, each\ndaughter molecule has received one parental subunit\u201d (p.\n676).\n\nMeselson and Stahl also noted the implications of their work for\ndeciding among the proposed mechanisms for DNA replication. In a\nsection labeled \u201cThe Watson-Crick Model\u201d they noted that,\n\u201cThis [the structure of the DNA molecule] suggested to Watson\nand Crick a definite and structurally plausible hypothesis for the\nduplication of the DNA molecule. According to this idea, the two\nchains separate, exposing the hydrogen-bonding sites of the bases.\nThen, in accord with base-pairing restrictions, each chain serves as a\ntemplate for the synthesis of its complement. Accordingly, each\ndaughter molecule contains one of the parental chains paired with a\nnewly synthesized chain\u2026. The results of the present experiment\nare in exact accord with the expectations of the Watson-Crick model\nfor DNA replication\u201d (pp. 677\u2013678).\n\nIt also showed that the dispersive replication mechanism proposed by\nDelbruck, which had smaller subunits, was incorrect. \u201cSince the\napparent molecular weight of the subunits so obtained is found to be\nclose to half that of the intact molecule, it may be further concluded\nthat the subunits of the DNA molecule which are conserved at\nduplication are single, continuous structures. The scheme for DNA\nduplication proposed by Delbruck is thereby ruled out\u201d (p. 681).\nLater work by John Cairns and others showed that the subunits of DNA\nwere the entire single polynucleotide chains of the Watson-Crick model\nof DNA structure.\n\nThe Meselson-Stahl experiment is a crucial experiment in biology. It\ndecided between three proposed mechanisms for the replication of DNA.\nIt supported the Watson-Crick semiconservative mechanism and\neliminated the conservative and dispersive mechanisms. It played a\nsimilar role in biology to that of the experiments that demonstrated\nthe nonconservation of parity did in physics. Thus, we have seen\nevidence that experiment plays similar roles in both biology and\nphysics and also that the same epistemological strategies are used in\nboth disciplines.\n",
