It seems natural to assume that when one has a definition of a\nset of numbers, then one also has all the information about the\nmembers of the set and about its subsets, but this is not true. In\ngeneral the computation of the amount of information in a set of\nnumbers is a highly non-trivial issue. We give some results:\n\n\nLemma A subset \\(A \\subset S\\) of a set S can\ncontain more information conditional to the set than the set itself.\n\n\nProof: Consider the set S of all natural\nnumbers smaller than n. The descriptive complexity of this set\nin bits is \\( \\log_2 n + c\\). Now construct A by selecting half\nof the elements of S randomly. Observe that:  \n\\[I(A\\mid S)=\\log_2 {n \\choose {n/2}}\\]\n\n\nWe have: \n\\[\n\\lim_{n \\rightarrow \\infty} \n\\frac{I(A\\mid S)}\n{n}\n = \n\\lim_{n \\rightarrow \\infty} \n\\frac{\\log_2 {n \\choose {n/2}}}\n{n}\n = 1\\]\n\n\nThe conditional descriptive complexity of this set will be: \\(I(A\\mid\nS) \\approx n + c \\gg \\log n + c\\). \\(\\Box\\)\n\n\nA direct consequence is that we can lose information when we merge two\nsets. An even stronger result is: \n\n\nLemma: An element of a set can contain more\ninformation than the set itself. \n\nProof: Consider the set S of natural numbers\nsmaller then \\(2^n\\). The cardinality of S is \\(2^n\\). The\ndescriptive complexity of this set is \\(\\log n + c\\) bits, but for\nhalf of the elements of S we need n bits to describe\nthem. \\(\\Box\\)\n\n\nIn this case the description of the set itself is highly compressible,\nbut it still contains non-compressible elements. When we merge or\nsplit sets of numbers, or add or remove elements, the effects on the\namount of information are in general hard to predict and might even be\nuncomputable: \n\n\nTheorem: Information is not monotone under set\ntheoretical operations \n\nProof: Immediate consequence of the lemmas above.\n\\(\\Box\\)\n\n\nThis shows how the notion of information pervades our everyday life.\nWhen John has two apples in his pocket it seems that he can do\nwhatever he wants with them, but, in fact, as soon as he chooses one\nof the two, he has created (new) information. The consequences for\nsearch problems are clear: we can always effectively perform bounded\nsearch on the elements and the set of subsets of a set. Consequently\nwhen we search for such a set of subsets by means of partial\ndescriptions then the result generates (new) information. This\nanalysis prima facie appears to force us to accept that in mathematics\nthere are simple descriptions that allow us to identify complex\nobjects by means of systematic search. When we look for the object we\nhave only little information about it, when we finally find it our\ninformation increases to the set of full facts about the object\nsearched. This is in conflict with our current theories of information\n(Shannon and Kolmogorov): any description that allows us to identify\nan object effectively by deterministic search contains all relevant\ninformation about the object. The time complexity of the search\nprocess then is irrelevant. \n",
