    "main_text": "The Limits of Human Understanding || Book I\n2.1 Book I\n\nAt the beginning of An Essay Concerning Human Understanding\nLocke says that since his purpose is \u201cto enquire into the\nOriginal, Certainty and Extent of human knowledge, together with the\ngrounds and degrees of Belief, Opinion and Assent\u201d he is going\nto begin with ideas\u2014the materials out of which knowledge is\nconstructed. His first task is to \u201cenquire into the Original of\nthese Ideas\u2026and the ways whereby the Understanding comes to be\nfurnished with them\u201d (I.1.3, N: 44). The role of Book I of the\nEssay is to make the case that being innate is not a way in\nwhich the understanding is furnished with principles and ideas. Locke\ntreats innateness as an empirical hypothesis and argues that there is\nno good evidence to support it.\n\nLocke describes innate ideas as \u201csome primary\nnotions\u2026Characters as it were stamped upon the Mind of Man,\nwhich the Soul receives in its very first Being; and brings into the\nworld with it\u201d (I.2.1, N: 48). In pursuing this enquiry, Locke\nrejects the claim that there are speculative innate principles (I.2),\npractical innate moral principles (I.3) or that we have innate ideas\nof God, identity or impossibility (I.4). Locke rejects arguments from\nuniversal assent and attacks dispositional accounts of innate\nprinciples. Thus, in considering what would count as evidence from\nuniversal assent to such propositions as \u201cWhat is, is\u201d or\n\u201cIt is impossible for the same thing to be and not to be\u201d\nhe holds that children and idiots should be aware of such truths if\nthey were innate but that they \u201chave not the least apprehension\nor thought of them\u201d. Why should children and idiots be aware of\nand able to articulate such propositions? Locke says:\n\n\nIt seems to me a near Contradiction to say that there are truths\nimprinted on the Soul, which it perceives or understands not;\nimprinting if it signify anything, being nothing else but the making\ncertain Truths to be perceived. (I.2.5, N: 49)\n\n\nSo, Locke\u2019s first point is that if propositions were innate they\nshould be immediately perceived\u2014by infants and idiots (and\nindeed everyone else)\u2014but there is no evidence that they are.\nLocke then proceeds to attack dispositional accounts that say,\nroughly, that innate propositions are capable of being perceived under\ncertain circumstances. Until these circumstances come about the\npropositions remain unperceived in the mind. With the advent of these\nconditions, the propositions are then perceived. Locke gives the\nfollowing argument against innate propositions being\ndispositional:\n\n\nFor if any one [proposition] may [be in the mind but not be known];\nthen, by the same Reason, all Propositions that are true, and the Mind\nis ever capable of assenting to, may be said to be in the Mind, and to\nbe imprinted: since if any one can be said to be in the Mind, which it\nnever yet knew, it must be only because it is capable of knowing it;\nand so the Mind is of all Truths it ever shall know. (I.2.5, N:\n50)\n\n\nThe essence of this argument and many of Locke\u2019s other arguments\nagainst dispositional accounts of innate propositions is that such\ndispositional accounts do not provide an adequate criterion for\ndistinguishing innate propositions from other propositions that the\nmind may come to discover. Thus, even if some criterion is proposed,\nit will turn out not to do the work it is supposed to do.\n\nWhen Locke turns from speculative principles to the question of\nwhether there are innate practical moral principles, many of the\narguments against innate speculative principles continue to apply, but\nthere are some additional considerations. Practical principles, such\nas the Golden Rule, are not self-evident in the way such speculative\nprinciples as \u201cWhat is, is\u201d are. Thus, one can clearly and\nsensibly ask reasons for why one should hold the Golden Rule true or\nobey it (I.3.4, N: 68). There are substantial differences between\npeople over the content of practical principles. Thus, they are even\nless likely candidates to be innate propositions or to meet the\ncriterion of universal assent. In the fourth chapter of Book I, Locke\nraises similar points about the ideas which compose both speculative\nand practical principles. The point is that if the ideas that are\nconstitutive of the principles are not innate, this gives us even more\nreason to hold that the principles are not innate. He examines the\nideas of identity, impossibility and God to make these points.\n\nIn Book I Locke says little about who holds the doctrine of innate\nprinciples that he is attacking. For this reason he has sometimes been\naccused of attacking straw men. John Yolton has persuasively argued\n(Yolton 1956) that the view that innate ideas and principles were\nnecessary for the stability of religion, morality and natural law was\nwidespread in England in the seventeenth century, and that in\nattacking both the naive and the dispositional account of innate ideas\nand innate principles, Locke is attacking positions which were widely\nheld and continued to be held after the publication of the\nEssay. Thus, the charge that Locke\u2019s account of innate\nprinciples is made of straw, is not a just criticism. But there are\nalso some important connections with particular philosophers and\nschools that are worth noting and some points about innate ideas and\ninquiry.\n\nAt I. 4. 24. Locke tells us that the doctrine of innate principles\nonce accepted \u201ceased the lazy from the pains of search\u201d\nand that the doctrine is an inquiry stopper that is used by those who\n\u201caffected to be Masters and Teachers\u201d to illegitimately\ngain control of the minds of their students. Locke rather clearly has\nin mind the Aristotelians and scholastics at the universities. Thus\nLocke\u2019s attack on innate principles is connected with his\nanti-authoritarianism. It is an expression of his view of the\nimportance of free and autonomous inquiry in the search for truth.\nUltimately, Locke holds, this is the best road to knowledge and\nhappiness. Locke, like Descartes, is tearing down the foundations of\nthe old Aristotelian scholastic house of knowledge. But while\nDescartes focused on the empiricism at the foundation of the\nstructure, Locke is focusing on the claims that innate ideas provide\nits first principles. The attack on innate ideas is thus the first\nstep in the demolition of the scholastic model of science and\nknowledge. Ironically, it is also clear from II.1.9. that Locke sees\nDescartes\u2019 claim that his essence is to be a thinking thing as\nentailing a doctrine of innate ideas and principles.\n",
