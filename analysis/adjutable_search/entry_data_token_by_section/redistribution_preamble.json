    "main_text": "\n\n\nWhen philosophers, social scientists, and politicians seek to\ndetermine the justice of institutional arrangements, their discussions\nhave often taken the form of questioning whether and under what\ncircumstances the redistribution of wealth or other valuable goods is\njustified. This essay examines the different ways in which\nredistribution can be understood, the diverse political contexts in\nwhich it has been employed, and whether or not it is a useful concept\nfor exploring questions of distributive justice.\n",
