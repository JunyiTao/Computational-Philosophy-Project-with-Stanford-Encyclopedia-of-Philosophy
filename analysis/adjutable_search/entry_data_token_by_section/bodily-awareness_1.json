    "main_text": "The body from the inside || Varieties of bodily experiences\n1.1 Varieties of bodily experiences\n\nMost discussions on bodily sensations focus on the privileged relation\nthey have with the subject\u2019s body and assume a unified account\nfor bodily awareness, as if it made no difference whether one feels\npain, touch or hunger. However, there are clear physiological,\nphenomenological, and epistemic differences among them. Here is a\nbrief overview of the specificities of each type of bodily\nsensations:\n\nTactile sensations are mediated by cutaneous mechanoreceptors\n(see Entry on Touch). Touch carries information both about the object\none is in contact with and about the body part in contact (Katz 1925;\nFulkerson 2014; Richardson 2013; Vignemont and Massin, 2015). For\nsome, it is the most important sense because it gives us an\nexperiential access to the reality of the world we are in contact\nwith: \n\n\nThere is no commoner remark than this, that resistance to our muscular\neffort is the only sense which makes us aware of a reality independent\nfrom ourselves. (James 1880: 29; see also Armstrong 1962; Condillac 1754; Maine de\nBiran, 1812) \n\n\nHowever, there is a large debate in the literature about how to\ndistinguish touch from other senses. For instance, are thermal\nsensations tactile sensations or not? Should one distinguish sensory\ntouch and affective touch (McGlone et al. 2014)?\n\nProprioceptive experiences provide information about the\nposition and movement of the body, although the notion of\nproprioception is sometimes enlarged to refer to all bodily sensations\n(Berm\u00fadez 1998). The mechanisms of proprioception include\nmuscle spindles, which are sensitive to muscle stretch, Golgi tendon\norgans, which are sensitive to tendon tension, and joint receptors,\nwhich are sensitive to joint position. One question is whether these\nsignals give rise to sensations or not (Anscombe 1962).\n\nThe sense of balance depends on vision, touch, and more\nimportantly on the vestibular system in the inner ear, which\nprovides information about the balance of the body. It includes three\nroughly orthogonal semicircular canals, which are sensitive to motion\nacceleration as our head moves in space, and two otolith organs, which\nare sensitive to the pull of gravity. It replies to two questions: (1)\n\u2018Which way is up?\u2019 and (2) \u2018Where am I\nheading?\u2019. As for proprioception, one may question whether there\nis a phenomenology of balance. Besides cases of dizziness, there seems\nto be indeed a paucity of vestibular experiences in normal consciousness.\nThe vestibular system has been ascribed a major role for self-location\nby anchoring the subject to her location and in orienting the subject\nin the world (Wong 2017). \n\nPain raises many challenges for philosophers (see Pain\nentry), and the variety of painful experiences makes the problems even\nmore complex (Corns 2014). From a physiological level, we have\nnociceptors on the skin that respond to dangerously intense\nmechanical stimuli, to mechanothermal stimuli or to thermal and\nchemical stimuli. According to the dominant theory, noxious signals\nare inhibited, enhanced or distorted by various factors via a gating\nmechanism at the level of the spinal cord that controls the amount of\nsignals from the periphery to brain structures and via a central\ngating mechanism (Melzack & Wall 1983). A major issue is to\naccount for both the sensory component of pain, which represents the\nfelt location and intensity of the sensation, and for the affective\ncomponent, its unpleasantness, which motivates protective behaviors.\nTo do so, recent representationalist theories propose that pain has\nevaluative content (Bain 2013) or imperative content (Klein 2015;\nMartinez 2011; Hall 2008).\n\nInteroceptive awareness provides information about the\nphysiological condition of the body in order to maintain optimal\nhomeostasis, namely, cardiovascular, respiratory, energy (feeding and\nglucose), and fluid (electrolyte and water) balances. It has been\nrecently suggested that interoception plays a major role for grounding\nthe \u201cbodily self\u201d (Damasio 1999; Craig 2003; Seth 2013;\nTsakiris & de Preester 2018). There is, however, a debate on how\nto define interoception (Ceunen, Vlaeyen, & Van Diest 2016). Does\nit include only information about the homeostatic state of the\norganism, as originally proposed by Sherrington (1906), or any\nsensation with an affective component, thus including pain and\naffective touch, as recently assumed by Craig (2003)?\n\nDavid Armstrong (1962) has been the only one to offer a taxonomy of\nall these bodily experiences. He draws a first contrast between\nbodily sensations and bodily feelings. Sensations,\nsuch as touch and pain, are local whereas feelings, such as thirst,\nhunger, fatigue, sleepiness, dizziness, and shortness of breath, are\nglobal. For instance, you can distinguish the local sensation of\npinprick at the tip of your index finger with the diffuse feeling of\nfatigue in your whole body. Or consider the case of thirst: it reveals\nthe general state of the entirety of your body missing water. More\ngenerally, interoceptive feelings inform us about the welfare of the\norganism as a whole. Their spatial principle of organization is thus\nholistic. Within the category of bodily sensations, Armstrong further\ndistinguishes transitive and intransitive bodily\nsensations. One experiences a mind-independent object in transitive\nsensations, as in touch, but it does not seem so in intransitive ones,\nas in pain. As described by Reid (1764: 56), \n\n\nIf a man runs his head with violence against a pillar \u2026 he\nfeels nothing in the stone but feels a violent pain in his head. It is\nquite otherwise when he leans his head gently against the pillar, for\nthen he will tell you that he feels nothing in his head, but feels\nhardness in the stone.\n\n\nTo Armstrong\u2019s list, one may add what has been called\nexistential feelings (Ratcliffe 2008; Billon 2015). All those bodily\nsensations listed above describe the \u2018anecdotal\u2019 state of\nthe body, so to speak, that is, the state of the body that keeps\nchanging (e.g., its posture, its temperature, its movement, and so\nforth). However, there is another aspect of bodily awareness, which is\nless directly connected to sensory receptors, and which concerns the\nenduring state of the body, its \u2018fundamental\u2019 properties.\nImagine having a terrible nightmare in which you are floating in the\nsky but then suddenly start falling down. After waking up, you become\naware that you are alive and that all your limbs are intact. You are\naware of your body being here in your bedroom, no longer floating up\nin the sky. You also regain awareness that this body has two legs and\ntwo arms that can cycle and swim, but that cannot fly. You are finally\naware that this body is of a highly peculiar significance for you: it\nis yours, or maybe even it is you. It includes the sense of bodily\npresence (awareness of one\u2019s body as being here), the sense of\nbodily ownership (awareness of one\u2019s body as being one\u2019s\nown), and the sense of bodily agency (awareness of one\u2019s bodily\ncapacities for action). These senses are rarely at\nthe forefront of consciousness because they normally do not vary, and\nthus do not attract attention.\n",
