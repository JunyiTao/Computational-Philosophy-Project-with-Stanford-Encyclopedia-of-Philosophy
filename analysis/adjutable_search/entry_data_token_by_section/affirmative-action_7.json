    "main_text": "The Integration Argument\n8. The Integration Argument\n\n\nAlthough the University couched its legal defense in terms of the\n\u201ceducational benefits of diversity,\u201d another rationale lay ready at\nhand. The main reason the University of Michigan strives for a\nreasonable representation of minorities on campus is because of the\nway it conceives of its mission: to prepare Michigan\u2019s future\nleaders.\n\n\nThe argument is straightforward:\n\nThe leadership of the state ought roughly to represent the state\u2019s\npopulation, ethnically and racially.\nAs the state\u2019s premier training ground for leadership, the\nUniversity ought to graduate rising generations of future leaders that\nconform to this representational goal.\nTo graduate such rising generations, it needs to admit racially and\nethnically representative classes.\n\n\n\nThis is the \u201cMichigan Mandate\u201d (Gratz\nv. Bollinger, 135 F. Supp. 2d 790 [2001], at 796\u2013797).\nRacial and ethnic diversity aren\u2019t incidental contributors to a\ndistinct academic mission; they are part of the mission of\nthe University, just as educating young people from Michigan is part\nof it (see Fullinwider and Lichtenberg 2004, 165\u2013188). And\nsomething like a national version of the mandate underlies the\nMichigan Law School\u2019s affirmative action policy, since its\ngraduates move into elite law firms or government service outside\nMichigan (see Lempert et al. 2000, 399; Wilkins 2000,\n530\u2013534).\n\n\nThis \u201cintegration\u201d rationale seems better aligned with the\nactual practice of university affirmative action than the diversity\nrationale. Indeed, in the midst of her nominally Powell-like defense\nof the Law School, Justice O\u2019Connor in Grutter for a\nmoment veered away from the \u201ceducational benefits of\ndiversity\u201d to go down a quite different path. Institutions like\nthe University of Michigan and its Law School, she noted,\n\u201crepresent the training ground for\u2026our Nation\u2019s\nleaders.\u201d She went on:\n\n\nIn order to cultivate a set of leaders with legitimacy in the eyes\nof the citizenry, it is necessary that the path to leadership be\nvisibly open to talented and qualified individuals of every race and\nethnicity. All members of our heterogeneous society must have\nconfidence in the openness and integrity of the educational\ninstitutions that provide this training.\u2026Access\u2026must be\ninclusive\u2026of every race and ethnicity, so that all members of\nour heterogeneous society may participate in the educational\ninstitutions that provide the training and education necessary to\nsucceed in\n America (Grutter, at 336).\n\n\n\n\nThis \u201clegitimacy\u201d argument\u2014not in any way about\nenriching the climate of opinion on campus or improving\nstudents\u2019 complex thinking skills\u2014parallels the simple\nsyllogism set out just above. Justice O\u2019Connor inserted this new\nrationale into the middle of her Grutter\nopinion\u2014inserted it unexpectedly and then abandoned it just as\nquickly to resume tracing the byways of diversity. Justice Kennedy did\nthe same in Fisher (2016, 2211).  \n\n\nCertainly, something in the spirit of the \u201cMichigan\nMandate\u201d has animated elite universities, including those\nstudied by William Bowen and Derek Bok in The Shape of the River:\nLong-Term Consequences of Considering Race in College and University\nAdmissions. The primary aim of these institutions is not through\nvigorous affirmative action to enhance the liberal learning of their\nstudents (although they welcome this gain for all students). Their\nmain motive for assuring that the percentage of African-Americans and\nHispanics on their campuses is more than token derives from their\nself-conceptions as institutions training individuals who will some\nday take up national and international leadership roles in the\nprofessions, arts, sciences, education, politics, and government\n(Bowen and Bok 1998, 7).  Society, they believe, will be stronger and\nmore just if the ranks of its leading citizens include a racially and\nethnically broader range of people than it does now. Nor are they\nwrong in thinking that the pipeline to local and national elites runs\nthrough top-notch universities.\n\n\nElizabeth Anderson, in two long essays (2002, 2004), bookending\nthe Grutter decision, makes a thorough and cogent case for\nputting racial integration at the center of conceptions of affirmative\naction. The diversity argument is insufficient, she\nwrites. \u201cConsidered as a purely cognitive end, divorced from the\nvalues of democracy and social justice, the \u2018robust exchange of\nideas\u2019 cannot support the scope of racial preferences in college\nadmissions\u201d (Anderson 2002, 1221). She goes on:\n\n\nThe integrative model of affirmative action offers an alternative\nrationale for race\u2013sensitive admissions that unites educational\nwith democratic and social justice concerns. It begins with a\nrecognition that Americans live in a profoundly segregated society, a\ncondition inconsistent with a fully democratic society and with equal\nopportunity. To achieve the latter goals, we need to\ndesegregate\u2014to integrate, that is\u2014to live together as one\nbody of equal citizens (Anderson 2002, 1222).\n\n\n\nThe integrative model has several legal advantages over the diversity\nand compensation models of affirmative action. It makes sense of the\nscope and weight that educational institutions actually give to race\nin the admissions process. It thus closes the gap between theory and\npractice that makes affirmative action programs so vulnerable under\nstrict scrutiny. It also shows how race can be directly relevant to a\ncompelling state interest, rather than merely a proxy for something\nelse, such as diversity of opinions (Anderson 2002, 1226).\n\n\n\nGiven the realities of race in the U.S., people of different races\noccupy different walks of life. So in the U.S., democracy requires\nracial integration of the main institutions of civil society, the\nplaces where discussion of public import among citizens take place:\npublic accommodations, workplaces, schools, and neighborhoods. The\nsame point applies to society\u2019s elites, those who play a pivotal\nrole in formulating and adopting policies of public import. Elites, to\nbe legitimate, must serve a representative function: they must be\ncapable of and dedicated to representing the concerns of people from\nall walks of life, so that the policies they forge are responsive to\nthese concerns. An elite drawn only from segments of society that live\nin isolation from other segments will be ignorant of the circumstances\nand concerns of those who occupy other walks of life (Anderson 2004,\n22).\n\n\n\nAnderson sees integration as an end courts can accept, one that\ninforms many past judicial opinions and acts of legislation, and one\ngiven endorsement in Grutter:\n\nThe \u201cdiversity\u201d defense of affirmative action, articulated\nin Justice Powell\u2019s Bakke opinion, limits integration\nto those cases in which it can be shown to yield educational\nbenefits. Grutter advances a more robust integrationist\nperspective, which affirms racial integration as a compelling interest\napart rom its educational benefits (Anderson 2004, 23).\n\n\n(It is hard to see how Grutter represents a\n\u201crobust\u201d defense of integrative affirmative\naction. Justice O\u2019Connor introduced the \u201clegitimacy\u201d\nargument without prior preparation and left it hanging without further\ndevelopment. Justice Kennedy in Fisher likewise seemed not to\nnotice that the \u201clegitimacy\u201d argument departs considerably\nfrom the diversity rationale he was rehearsing. Nevertheless, there it\nis in the majority opinions, to be seized on and developed by a future\ncourt if it is so disposed.)[27] \n \nOther writers, too, have talked about affirmative action in terms\nof integration (Warnke 1998; Estlund 2002; Jacobs 2004; Boddie\n2016). \n\n\nThe integration argument, like the diversity argument, is\nstraightforwardly instrumental. It points to hoped-for outcomes of\naffirmative action. If those outcomes don\u2019t materialize, then\naffirmative action\u2019s cause is weakened. Moreover, the little\nintegration syllogism isn\u2019t complete as it stands. It needs to include\nanother premise: that the gains from achieving racially and ethnically\nintegrated classes don\u2019t come at a disproportionate cost.\n\n\nPerhaps the cost is high, or even too high. Stephan and Abigail\nThernstrom certainly think so. They contend that most of the cost\nfalls on the very persons affirmative action is supposed to benefit.\nUnder-prepared African-Americans are thrown into academic environments\nwhere they cannot succeed (Thernstrom and Thernstrom 1997, 395\u2013411).\nIn the Thernstroms\u2019 view, race-blind admissions policies will result\nin a desirable \u201ccascading,\u201d with African-American and\nHispanic students ending up at colleges and universities where the\nacademic credentials of their fellow students match their\nown. However, the Bowen and Bok study provides some evidence that\ncascading isn\u2019t necessarily a valuable phenomenon. In fact, at the\nschools they studied, the better the institution a student entered,\nwhatever his academic credentials, the more likely he was to graduate,\ngo on to further education, and earn a good\nincome (Bowen and Bok 1998, 63, 114,\n 144).\n\n\nEven so, the select schools Bowen and Bok studied may be quite\nunrepresentative of the full range of schools that\nresort to racial preferences and the cost-benefit picture that holds\nfor these schools may not hold for the rest. Indeed, the picture drawn\nby Richard Sander in a lengthy review of affirmative action in law\nschools, published in the November 2004 Stanford Law Review,\nlends credence to the Thernstrom\u2019s academic mismatch thesis. Ranking\nlaw schools from best to worst, Sander found that affirmative action\nboosts African-American students 20 or more steps up the ladder,\nputting them in schools with white classmates who possess considerably\nbetter LSAT scores and undergraduate college grades.  The upshot:\n\u201cclose to half of black students end up in the bottom tenth of\ntheir classes.\u201d This bad performance yields three bad\nconsequences.  First, African-American students suffer high attrition\nrates.  Second, they fail the bar exam at a high rate (the principal\npredictor of a student\u2019s passing or failing is her grades, not the\nquality of her school).  Third, they suffer a significant employment\npenalty for low grades \u201cin all schools outside the top\nten.\u201d Sander estimates that under a race-blind admissions\nsystem, American law schools would actually create more\nAfrican-American lawyers than they do under affirmative action (Sander\n2004, 449, 460, 478, 479).\n\n\nSander\u2019s article inspired a flurry of responses disputing his\nmethodology and conclusions (e.g., Ayers and Brooks 2005, Chambers,\net al. 2005, Wilkins 2005, Ho 2005, Barnes 2007, and\nRothstein and Yoon 2008).  Sander replied to his critics (Sander\n2005); other writers found evidence of mismatch effects in educational\ndomains outside law schools (Elliott et al. 1996, Smith and\nMcArdle, 2004, Arcidiacono et al. 2012); yet other scholars\npresented independent confirmation of Sander\u2019s hypothesis\n(Arcidiacono et al. 2011b, Williams 2013), One critic, upon\nre-analysis, had to withdraw her refutation of Sander (Barnes 2007,\nBarnes 2011); and in 2012 Sander joined with co-author Stuart Taylor\nto publish Mismatch, a book-length treatment setting out old\nand new research supporting Sander\u2019s hypothesis. Others continue\nto find the law school mismatch hypothesis dubious and unsupported\n(Camilli and Welner 2011; Camilli and Jackson 2011; Kidder and Lempert\n2015) \n\nOther researchers, following the lead of Bowen and Bok, have focused\non undergraduate performance. Fischer and Massey, for example,\nconcluded that though affirmative action has \u201cboth positive and\nnegative implications for minority students, [such policies] operate,\non balance, to enhance the academic achievement of minority\nstudents\u201d (Fischer and Massey 2007, 546). In another study,\nMassey and Mooney found \u201clittle support for the mismatch\nhypothesis\u201d (Massey and Mooney 2007, 114). Dale and Krueger\ndetermined that \u201cthe effect of attending a school with a higher\naverage SAT score is positive for black and Hispanic students\u201d\n(Dale and Krueger 2014, 350). Similarly, Melguizo held: \n\nthat for minority students who were admitted to\u2026selective\ninstitutions under affirmative action (i.e., with slightly\nbelow\u2013average SAT scores but with other personal characteristics\nand experiences correlated with persistence), their probability of\ngraduation was not lower as was predicted by critics of affirmative\naction. On the contrary, their probability of graduation was higher at\nthe most and very selective institutions compared to the\nnon\u2013selective ones (Melguizo 2008, 233).\n\n\n\n\nOne reason disputes persist about cause and effect is imperfect\ndata. Although often operating with large sets of information,\nresearchers must decide which statistical models most appropriately\ntease out significance, decisions that involve debatable assumptions\nabout filling in missing pieces. Two researchers note that\n\u201c[b]etter data would undoubtedly permit more relevant and\nconvincing analyses of the effects of mismatch and and would\nespecially help to identify any threshold below which potential\nmismatch effects become more probable\u201d (Camilli and Welner 2011,\n500). Much of the back\u2013and\u2013forth about the effects of\naffirmative action could be resolved if educational institutions\ndisclosed information about their admissions processes, student\ngrades, graduation rates, and the like. But institutional resistance\nmakes this unlikely.[28] \n",
