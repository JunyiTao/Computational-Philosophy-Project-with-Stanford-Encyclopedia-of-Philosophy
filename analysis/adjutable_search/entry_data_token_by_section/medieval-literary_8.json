    "main_text": "Literary Forms || Sentences and Sentences Commentaries\n2.8 Sentences and Sentences Commentaries\n\nSentences as a genre is a development of earlier collections\nof sayings or citations of the church fathers. Such collections, known\nas florilegia, were collections of citations organized around\nthe order of scripture. The development of the scholastic sentences\ncollection can be attributed jointly to Anselm of Laon, Abelard, and\nPeter Lombard. Anselm of Laon and his school, so famously criticized\nby Abelard in his Historia Calamitatum, can be credited with\ndeveloping a critical approach to the authorities they cited; they\nsometimes disregarded or criticized opinions rather than always\nseeking to preserve them all (Colish 1994, 42\u201346). The next\nsignificant development is in the organization of these collections,\nfrom an organization following the order of scripture to an\norganization based on systematic questions of theology. Such a change\nbrings speculative and philosophical questions to the fore, questions\nconcerning the divine nature and metaphysics, and anthropological and\nethical problems. Peter Abelard\u2019s Sic et Non opposes\nauthoritative quotations from church fathers on particular questions\narranged in an order and on topics that are systematic rather than\nnarrative. What Abelard attempted in the various versions of\nTheologia but did not ever manage successfully to do was to\ngather those various questions into a systematic organization and\ndivision of theology as a discipline. This was the achievement of\nPeter Lombard.\n\nPeter Lombard\u2019s Sentences was by far the most\nsuccessful instance of the form. Commenting on it became an academic\nrequirement for the master of theology in the 13th century, a status\nit retained until the later 15th century, with new commentaries still\nappearing in the 18th (Silano 2007, xxx). (The nature of these\ncommentaries varies quite a bit, early commentaries tending to be line\nby line glosses, and later ones more often a series of\nquaestiones on more or less selected topics raised by Peter.\nSee Evans 2002 and Rosemann 2009.) Though Peter claims in his prologue\nmerely to have made a collection of the views of Church Fathers and\nmost historians have taken him at his word, his advance lies in the\norganization of particular questions into a unified plan, based on\nAugustine\u2019s distinction between things to be enjoyed (God alone)\nand things to be used (everything else). Secondly, Peter offers his\nown responses to questions, engages and refutes the opinions of\ncontemporaries when necessary, and in many cases, uses the form to\narticulate, justify, and create a consensus view. Besides giving\ntheology an organization and making a place for all questions to be\nconsidered, Peter often explicitly leaves some questions open. Peter\nthus invites others to join in the debate and conversation rather than\nsimply accept or reject his views. All of these features made his work\nespecially fruitful for later commentary. Further, Peter Lombard,\nunlike Abelard, attempted to give substantive and metaphysically based\nrather than merely verbal solutions to theological problems, a method\nmore in tune with the 13th century curriculum focused on Aristotle,\nthan the 12th, organized around the trivium arts, also positioning\nPeter\u2019s Sentences for the preeminence it achieved in\nthe 13th century.\n\nThe great mystery about the Lombard\u2019s Sentences is how\na book so important for centuries has been so greatly neglected by\nscholars, even by those interested in and sympathetic to medieval\nscholasticism. One intriguing suggestion is that it is tied to the\ngenre of the work and the different notion of authorship thereby\nimplied. Giulio Silano argues that the work is most analogous to a\nmodern legal casebook, and that Peter, as the casebook author, is\ngoverned most directly not by his views but those of the authorities,\nand the pedagogical goal is not the expression and promulgation of his\nviews, or even the mere learning of the authorities\u2019 views but\nrather the initiation of the student into a discipline, as in\njurisprudence, a way of thinking and applying past authorities to\npresent questions or conflicts (Silano 2007). Thus we discount and\nmisunderstand Peter Lombard\u2019s achievement if we evaluate it in\nlight of modern notions of authorship and originality.\n",
