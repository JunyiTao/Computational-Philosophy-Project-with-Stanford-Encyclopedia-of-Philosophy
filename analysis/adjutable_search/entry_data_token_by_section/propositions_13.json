    "main_text": "Linguistic Problems? || Modifying/Replacing the Relational Analysis\n5.7 Modifying/Replacing the Relational Analysis\n\nLet us suppose, for the sake of argument, the linguistic problems\ndiscussed above undermine the Relational Analysis. Can a\npropositionalist dissociate herself from that analysis, and its\nlinguistic difficulties, while still endorsing the arguments we\ndiscussed for propositions in section 5.1?\n\nSome modifications of the Relational Analysis do not avoid the\nlinguistic problems. For instance, it is not enough to claim that\nattitude verbs designate three-place relations between\nsubjects, propositions, and modes of presentation.\n\nOne possibility is to deny that attitude verbs designate relations\nwhen complemented by that-clauses, and to claim that they\nrather make a syncategorematic semantic contribution. Under one\napproach, that-clauses in attitude ascriptions designate\npropositions which serve to \u201cmeasure\u201d attitudes conceived\nof as mental particulars (Matthews 1994). It is not clear that this\nview will be immune to substitution and objectivization problems. See\nMoltmann (2003) for further discussion.\n\nAnother possibility is to abandon the Relational Analysis altogether,\nin favor of a version of Bertrand Russell\u2019s \u201cmultiple\nrelation\u201d theory. Following Russell (1911; 1913; 1918), Newman\n(2002) and Moltmann (2003; 2004), have recently argued that\nthat-clauses in attitude ascriptions do not designate\npropositions but rather provide a number of entities as terms of a\n\u201cmultiple\u201d attitude relation. These philosophers\nnonetheless do accept propositions, and use them to explain sentences\nin which \u2018proposition\u2019 explicitly occurs, e.g.,\n(\u2018Some proposition that John believes is true\u2019,\n\u2018John believes the proposition that snow is white\u2019). The\nbasic idea is that there are propositions, but they have the status of\n\u201cderived objects\u201d\u2014derived from our attitudes, which\nthemselves are not relations to propositions. It is an interesting\nquestion whether a Russellian is positioned to endorse the arguments\nfor propositions given in section 4. (For more on the Russellian\ntheory, see the supplementary document:\n\nThe Multiple Relation Theory\n\n\nAn alternate proposal which abandons the Relational Analysis takes\nthat-clauses to be predicates. Van Elswyk (2020) argues that\nthis explains why that-clauses can compose with nouns, as in\n\u2018the belief that snow is white\u2019, as well as why\nthat-clauses can follow the adverb \u2018now\u2019, as in\n\u2018now that Giannis will be named MVP, Giannis will be offered a\nsupermax contract\u2019. In the first case, the that-clause\nspecifies the content of the attitude denoted by the noun phrase (e.g.\n\u2018the belief\u2019). In the second case, the use of\n\u2018now\u2019 contributes the information that the event \\(e_1\\)\ndescribed in the main clause occurs after the event \\(e_2\\) following\n\u2018now\u2019. The that-clause serves as a predicate that\nis satisfied by \\(e_2\\). Even rejecting the Relational Analysis, van\nElswyk finds a need for propositions as meanings of sentences and the\nthings designated by certain names (e.g. \u2018logicism\u2019),\nproposition descriptions, and propositional anaphors, such as\n\u2018so\u2019, \u2018yes\u2019, and \u2018no\u2019.\n\nTrueman (2021) rejects the Relational Analysis in favor of a\nprenective view of attitude reports inspired by Prior (1971).\nWhereas the Relational Analysis treats the attitude verb \\(V\\) in\nascriptions of the form \u2018\\(S\\) \\(V\\)s that \\(p\\)\u2019 as\ncontributing a dyadic relation between \\(S\\) and the proposition\ndesignated by \u2018that \\(p\\)\u2019, this view treats V as\nprenective, meaning that it acts as a predicate at one end and a\nsentential connective at the other. So, the prenective view denies\nthat \u2018that \\(p\\)\u2019 is a singular term, instead parsing our\nascription as \u2018[\\(S\\)] \\(V\\)s that [\\(p\\)]\u2019, where\n\u2018\\(p\\)\u2019 is a sentence that expresses the proposition\ncontent of S\u2019s attitude. In denying that that-clauses\nare singular terms, Trueman avoids reifying propositions, and instead\nidentifies propositional contents as truth-conditions of sentences.\nThus, to believe the proposition that \\(p\\) is to stand in the\nbelieving relation to the truth-condition of \u2018\\(p\\)\u2019.\n\nOne might worry that the prenective parsing of belief reports clashes\nwith the syntactic data that motivated treating that-clauses\nas singular terms in the first place. After all, instead of\n\u2018Simon believes that Sharon is funny\u2019, we may say\n\u2018that Sharon is funny is what Simon believes\u2019, where the\ncomplementizer \u2018that\u2019 moves with \u2018Sharon is\nfunny\u2019 rather than staying put with \u2018believes\u2019.\nTrueman responds in two parts. First, the mere fact that\nthat-clauses are syntactic units does not imply anything\nsemantic about them\u2014viz., that they are singular terms.\n(Hofweber 2016 gives a sustained defense of this point.) Second, he\nmodifies the proposal from Prior\u2019s original parsing; rather than\n\u2018[\\(S\\)] \\(V\\)s that [\\(p\\)]\u2019, attitude ascriptions are\nparsed as \u2018[\\(S\\)] \\(V\\)s [\\(p\\)]\u2019. The complementizer\n\u2018that\u2019 is semantically vacuous, but functions to indicate\nthat \u2018Sharon is funny\u2019 is a complement of\n\u2018believes\u2019 rather than occurring as a standalone sentence.\n\n",
