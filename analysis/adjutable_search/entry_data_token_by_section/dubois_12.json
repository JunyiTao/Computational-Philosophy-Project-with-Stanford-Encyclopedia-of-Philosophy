    "main_text": "Philosophy of Art || High Art and Low Art\n5.1 High Art and Low Art\n\nDu Bois\u2019s articulation of his commitment to the ideal of\nholistic self-cultivation is perhaps most explicit when, in amplifying\nhis criticism of Booker T. Washington, he defends the importance of\nliberal arts education (Gooding-Williams, 2009, 133\u2013139).\nExplicitly echoing Matthew Arnold, Du Bois advocated liberal arts\neducation as a means to self-cultivation or, as he sometimes writes,\nself-development, through \u201cgetting to know\u2026the best that\nhas been said and thought in the world\u201d (Arnold, 1869, 5).\nSelf-development through the acquisition of culture is the purpose of\nthe education elites require to uplift the masses. The Negro college,\nDu Bois writes, \u201cmust develop men\u2026Above our modern\nsocialism, and out of the worship of the mass, must persist that\nhigher individualism which centres of culture protect; there must come\na loftier respect for the sovereign human souls that seeks to know\nitself and the world about it; that seeks a freedom for expansion and\nself-development\u201d (1903a, 52).\n\nFor the Du Bois of Souls, the art that sovereign souls\nappreciate is high art\u2014or, in other words, art that shares with\nthe sovereign souls that appreciate it the property of holistic\nself-development. In \u201cThe Sorrow Songs,\u201d the final chapter\nof Souls, Du Bois represents the group spirit that unites\nblack Americans as clarifying its distinctive message through the\nmedium of the folk song. Considered in historical perspective, the\nmusically embodied spirit of the black folk, as it actualizes itself\nthrough time, in folk song after folk song, acquires a spiritually\ncomprehensive breadth that overcomes racial prejudice and\nprovincialism. To these songs, which manifest a developing folk spirit\nand that constitute an evolving tradition of black musical art, Du\nBois contrasts a \u201cmass\u201d of spiritually inert minstrel\nsongs, gospel hymns and coon songs (1903a, 124). In essence, he argues\nthat, no less than Wagner\u2019s operas, which he admired, the\nspiritually-inspired black folk song belongs to the canon of high art\nfrom which the low arts of the minstrel song and the like are\nexcluded.\n\nOn this view, Du Bois\u2019s early political expressivism is of a\npiece with his broadly expressivist philosophy of art, for it asserts\nthat, to be legitimate and effective, black political leaders must\ntake their bearing not from the uninspired mass of popular song that\nthe masses might enjoy, but from the spirit and spiritual message\nembodied in the black folk song (Gooding-Williams, 2009,\n139\u2013147).\n",
