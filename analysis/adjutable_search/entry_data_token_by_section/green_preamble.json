    "main_text": "\n\nThomas Hill Green (1836\u201382) is widely regarded as the founding\nand most influential figure in the tradition of British idealism that\nflourished in England, especially Oxford, and Scotland, especially\nGlasgow and Edinburgh, in the second half of the nineteenth century\nand early in the twentieth century (see, e.g., Mander 2011).\nGreen\u2019s idealism was systematic, embracing metaphysics and\nepistemology, ethical theory, political philosophy, and philosophy of\nhistory and religion. In metaphysics and epistemology, Green reflected\nthe influence of Immanuel Kant, criticizing the British empiricist\nlegacy of John Locke and David Hume. Green argued that empirical\nknowledge is the workmanship of the human mind, that reality depends\non thought and cannot transcend it, and that the possibility of\nobjectivity requires the existence of a single corporate or divine\nconsciousness of which individual minds are proper parts. The only\ndefensible form of idealism, Green thought, is absolute idealism, in\nwhich all aspects of reality are operations of a single consciousness.\nIn ethics, Green embraced a form of perfectionism that identifies the\nhuman good with self-realization and the perfection of our nature as\nmoral persons and agents. But self-realization must reflect the way in\nwhich individuals participate in associations and communities and, as\na result, must reflect the demand that individuals pursue a common\ngood. In articulating this conception of perfectionism, Green sees\nhimself as synthesizing the best elements in two different ethical\ntraditions\u2014Greek eudaimonism and Kantian rationalism.\nGreen\u2019s perfectionist ethics influence his politics. He provides\nthe philosophical foundations for a new progressive form of liberalism\nthat transcends the laissez-faire liberalism characteristic of some\nstrands in nineteenth century British liberalism. The state has a duty\nto promote the common good, and individual rights are constrained by\nthe common good. This gives the state not just negative duties to\nrefrain from interfering with the freedoms and opportunities of its\ncitizens but also positive duties to provide resources and\nopportunities for individual self-realization. The ethical and\npolitical demand for self-realization, Green thinks, is freedom,\nproperly understood. He believes that moral and political progress in\nhistory consists in the gradual and increasingly more adequate\nrealization of the values of perfection, the common good, and freedom.\nBecause Green identifies God with the metaphysical, ethical, and\npolitical principles in human nature, he sees God as immanent in the\nprogressive developments in human history.\n",
