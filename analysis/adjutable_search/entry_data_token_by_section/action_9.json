    "main_text": "Practical Knowledge || Arguments for a knowledge condition\n4.2 Arguments for a knowledge condition\n\nAnscombe presents several arguments for the claim that to act\nintentionally an agent must know what she is doing (call this the\n\u201dknowledge condition\u2019), and further arguments have been\npresented in the literature. This section surveys four influential\narguments.\n\nOne argument has already been mentioned: If a person is asked,\n\u201cWhy are you \u03c6-ing?\u201d and she (sincerely) replies,\n\u201cI didn\u2019t realize I was \u03c6-ing\u201d then she\nwasn\u2019t \u03c6-ing intentionally. It would seem to follow that a\nperson must know what she is doing if acting intentionally. However,\nthis argument is unsound. First, the expression \u201cI didn\u2019t\nrealize\u2026\u201d is colloquially used to express complete lack\nof awareness, rather than mere ignorance (Schwenkler 2019, 189). At\nmost, then, the argument would show that the action cannot be\ncompletely beyond the agent\u2019s purview. Second, even if the\nperson\u2019s state is in fact knowledge after the question\nis asked, this may be a conversational effect: By asking \u201cWhy\nare you \u03c6-ing?\u201d, the speaker intimates that the agent is\n\u03c6-ing. This puts the agent in a position to know this, but not in\na way that is tied to her agency.\n\nA more promising argument, suggested by Anscombe and endorsed by some\nof her followers in some form (Setiya 2007; Maru\u0161i\u0107 and\nSchwenkler 2018), appeals to the connection between action and\nassertion. It can be stated thus:\n\n\nPremise 1:\n\nIf S is \u03c6-ing intentionally, then she is in a position to\ncorrectly assert that she is \u03c6-ing.\n\nPremise 2:\n\nOne can correctly assert p only if one knows p.\n\nConclusion:\n\nTherefore, if S is \u03c6-ing intentionally, she knows that\nshe is \u03c6-ing.\n\n\nPremise 2 is the standard claim that knowledge is the norm of\nassertion (Unger 1975; Slote 1979; Williamson 2000; DeRose 2002;\nReynolds 2002; Hawthorne 2004). Premise 1 may also look innocuous;\nbut, as we shall see, there may be cases that speak against it.\n\nThere are two more influential arguments inspired by Anscombe that\nhave been used to defend the connection with knowledge. The first\nbegins with the observation that a process in progress bears a\nnon-accidental connection to its completion (Thompson 2011; Small\n2012; Wolfson 2012; Valaris 2021). If a house is burning, it would not\nbe an accident if it is burnt later; and if you are writing a letter,\nit won\u2019t be an accident if it is written later. What\ndistinguishes intentional action is that the non-accidental connection\nobtains in virtue of the agent\u2019s representation\u2014her\nintention\u2014to act in some way. That the agent is writing a\nletter\u2014even while she takes a break, cooks a snack, and goes to\nthe bathroom\u2014is true precisely because she represents herself as\nwriting a letter, and this representation guides her proceedings.\nIntentions, in other words ground what Falvey (2000) calls the\n\u201copenness of the progressive\u201d: the fact that \u201ca\nperson may be doing something, in a suitably broad sense, when at the\nmoment she is not doing anything, in a more narrow sense, that is for\nthe sake of what she is doing in the broad sense\u201d (p.22).\nSuppose, then, that an agent is intentionally \u03c6-ing. Then it is\ntrue that she represents herself as doing so, the representation is\ntrue, and non-accidentally so. It is a short step to the conclusion\nthat she knows that she is \u03c6-ing.\n\nThe final argument is based on the claim that intentional action is\naction for a reason (Thompson 2013). An agent must therefore be in a\nposition to give an answer fitting the schema:\n\n(1)\nI\u2019m \u03c6-ing because \u03c8.\n\n\nNow, Thompson (2008) has argued that the most basic way of filling\nthis schema is one where actions themselves occupy the \u03c8-position\n(i.e. where actions are given as reasons). For instance:\n\n(2)\nI am moving my hands because I am pumping water.\n\n\nSo, in what sort of relation must an agent stand to the fact that she\nis pumping water for a sentence like (2) to be true? Hyman (1999;\n2015) has argued that the relation must be knowledge (though see Dancy\n2000, ch.6). If, then, every intentional action description is one\nthat the agent could substitute for \u03c8 in (1), it follows that\nagents must know what they are doing when acting intentionally.\n",
