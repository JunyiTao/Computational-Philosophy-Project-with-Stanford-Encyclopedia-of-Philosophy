    "main_text": "Agents as Causes and the Practical Point of View\n5. Conclusion\n\n\nThese last observations take us back to where we started. The\npolitical demand to be permitted to govern ourselves is grounded in the\nmetaphysics of agency: any agent who faces the task of \u201cmaking up\nher mind\u201d has the authority to determine how she will act. On\nmost occasions, what an agent does is the direct effect of her exercise\nof this authority. Yet there is also ample evidence that the capacity\nfor self-government is vulnerable to any number of assaults; an agent\u2019s\nauthority over her actions is no guarantee that she has the power to\ndetermine how she exercises this authority. Agents can be deprived of\ntheir autonomy by brainwashing, depression, anxiety, fatigue; they can\nsuccumb to compulsions and addictions. To what, exactly, are we calling\nattention when we say that, under these conditions, an agent does not\ngovern herself, even if she acts as she does because she thinks she has\nsufficient reason to do so, even if she has (thoroughly) considered the\npros and cons of her options, and has endorsed her behavior on this\nbasis, and even if she would have acted differently if there had been\nstronger reason to do so? Most agents who are capable of asking this\nquestion are confident that they are the authors of most of their\nactions, and are thus accountable for most of what they do. Nonetheless, as\nthis brief survey indicates, the self-relation they thereby attribute\nto themselves is extremely difficult to pin \n down.[22]\n\n",
