    "main_text": "Physical Creation || Light\n3.4 Light\n\nBonaventure\u2019s treatment of light is mainly found in the\ndiscussion of light in his commentary on Lombard\u2019s\nSentences, Bk. 2, d. 13. In this theological context, light\nmainly bears upon the work of the six days of creation, and\nBonaventure must take a position on the Genesis account of the\ncreation of light. Though he acknowledges Augustine\u2019s\nspiritualizing interpretation of light, an interpretation that\nidentifies the light spoken of in Genesis with the creation and\nactivities of the angels, Bonaventure inclines to a more literal\ninterpretation (In II Sent. d. 13, art. 1, q. 1 [Quaracchi\nII: 312b\u2013313a]). This means that Bonaventure had to take a\nposition on the contemporary debates on light and its nature.\n\nThe two positions that Bonaventure discusses are what we may call a\nbroadly Aristotelian position, one eventually adopted by Thomas\nAquinas, and a broadly Augustinian position advocated by Robert\nGrosseteste in his On light (De luce). According to\nthe first, light is simply an accidental form, one found in degrees in\ndifferent bodies, but according to the second, light is perhaps a\nsubstance or at least a substantial form communicating extension and\nvisibility to physical things.\n\nBonaventure discounts the possibility that light is a substance,\nbecause it is purely active and if it were a substance in its own\nright it would be God and not a creature. He does allow, however, that\nlight is a substantial form and is the substantial form that is\nconcomitant with the mass of matter in its primordial state (In II\nSent. d. 13, art. 2, q. 2 [Quaracchi II: 320b\u2013321b]). In\nthis originating condition, light gave the mass of matter its\nextension and visibility and the hierarchy of heavenly bodies\ncorresponds to the hierarchy of things capable of partaking either\nmore or less in the light that renders bodies active and extended. For\nBonaventure, then, light is a substantial form, but only the partial\nperfection of any given physical substance, whether celestial or\nterrestrial. Since Bonaventure endorses, usually without any elaborate\nargumentation, the general claim that there is a plurality of\nsubstantial forms within any composite thing, his doctrine of light\nreally means that light is the first form, endowing each thing with\nextension, and preparing the way for further perfections such as the\nforms of the elements or the forms of mixtures or compounds.\n",
