    "main_text": "Ethical Issues in Obstetrical Care || Prenatal Diagnosis and Screening\n2.1 Prenatal Diagnosis and Screening\n\nIt is becoming increasingly routine to test fetuses for a variety of\ngenetic and other anomalies. Ultrasound screening for various\nmorphological anomalies and the Maternal Serum Alpha-Fetoprotein Test\n(MSAFP) that screens for trisomy chromosomal disorders such as Down\nsyndrome are routine parts of prenatal care; indeed, ultrasound\nscreening does not even require formal informed consent from patients.\nOther tests such as amniocentesis (which diagnoses rather than screens\nfor trisomy disorders) and genetic testing for Tay-Sachs disease are\ncommon. More arcane tests are available, and it seems clear that the\nrange of conditions and traits for which prenatal testing is possible\nwill continue to grow rapidly. The rise in prenatal testing allows\nparents and society at large new forms of control over what sorts of\nchildren are born, and it enhances the level of medicalization and\nsurveillance during pregnancy. These tests raise a variety of ethical\nissues.\n2.1.1 Issues for Pregnant Women\n\nBecause all prenatal testing is, strictly speaking, voluntary (even if\nroutinization and social pressures together may guide women towards\nchoosing it), and because the tests give prospective parents a form of\nincreased control over their reproductive lives, many writers have\nseen the advent of prenatal testing as straightforwardly enhancing\nwomen's reproductive autonomy. For instance, John Robertson (1996) has\nargued that women should have access to any technologically available\nprenatal test as part of their right to reproductive autonomy and\nprivacy. On his account, reproductive autonomy rights cover not only\nwhen and whether and how we reproduce, but what kind of child\nwe have, and the availability of prenatal tests increases this\nautonomy.\n\nThere are reasons to doubt, however, that increased access to prenatal\ntesting translates directly into an increase in women's autonomy. For\nexample, soon after Robertson argued for women's autonomous control\nover which tests they use, Julian Savulescu appealed to what he dubbed\nthe principle of \u201cprocreative beneficence\u201d in order to\nargue that pregnant women are morally required to utilize\navailable tests for serious fetal anomalies (and to abort fetuses with\nthese anomalies), because they are required to select the child, of\nthe possible children they could have, who is expected to have the\nbest possible life given the available information (Savulescu 2001,\n2007; Savuelescu and Kahane 2009). Others argue that reasons to select\nfor the best possible children extend beyond concern for the\nwell-being of the potential child herself to the well-being of others\n(Douglas and Devolder 2013, Elster 2011).\n\nPrenatal screening and diagnosis does not, at the very least,\nobviously or in principle operate to enhance free choices for women.\nVirtually all women undergo routine ultrasound testing and accept\nMSAFP testing when it is offered to them. Nancy Press and Carole\nBrowner (1995) have used qualitative evidence to argue that women tend\nto see the choice to accept MSAFP tests as the\n\u201cresponsible\u201d choice that \u201cprotects the\nhealth\u201d of their babies, even though the only intervention\navailable in the case of a positive test is abortion. When a test\nbecomes routine and medically legitimized, choosing against it can be\ndifficult. In light of such considerations, Press and Browner and\nothers have questioned the extent to which choices to test are really\ninformed and autonomous, and whether women are really prepared for\nmaking the difficult decisions that they may confront after testing.\nMany authors have also pointed out that as testing and abortion for\nfetal anomalies becomes more common, women who choose not to test, or\nwho choose to carry an impaired fetus to term, may face diminished\nsupport and increased blame for their choice (see for instance Lawson\n2003). Thus the availability and routinization of prenatal testing may\ncompromise women's autonomy in some ways while increasing it in\nothers.\n\nSeveral authors have pointed out that increased routine medical\nsurveillance during pregnancy has put new pressure on women to\nshoulder the responsibility for producing socially acceptable,\nproductive citizens, and for disciplining their own bodies and laying\nthem open to medical intervention and surveillance in accordance with\nthis goal (Tremain 2006, Kukla 2005, Roberts 2009). Prenatal testing\njoins forces with a host of other cultural pressures to portray\npregnancy as an inherently risky and perilous process (Duden 1993). It\ncan create unrealistic pressures on women to emotionally bond with or\ndisengage from their fetuses on cue (Kukla 2007a, Kukla 2008, Mitchell\n2001), and to keep their relationship to the pregnancy\n\u2018tentative\u2019 until tests come back negative (Katz-Rothman\n1993).\n2.1.2 Issues for Future Children\n\nA variety of ethical concerns have been raised with respect to how\nprenatal testing may impact future children. Some authors worry that\nprenatal testing helps to inculcate an inappropriate stance towards\nparenting: perhaps parents will come to desire or expect\n\u201cdesigner children\u201d built to their specifications, and\nthis may translate into an overly controlling attitude towards their\nchildren later in life, or an expectation that children will match an\nadvance set of idealized expectations about what they will be like\n(Rothschild 2005, Introduction to Parens and Asch 2000). A related\nconcern is that when carrying pregnancy to term becomes conditional\nupon the fetus having certain traits, our love for our children once\nthey are born may become similarly conditional. Most broadly,\nquestions regarding how prenatal screening and testing impacts the\nwell-being of future children remain unresolved. At the moment, almost\nall prenatal testing screens or diagnoses well-defined medical\ndisorders such as Down syndrome and Tay-Sachs disease. Ethical\nconcerns will likely become yet more acute as the technology develops,\nparticularly if it extends to testing for traits that are not clearly\ndisorders, such as homosexuality, aggression, or a propensity to\nobesity.\n\nPrenatal testing is often presented, in medical practice and in some\nbioethical literature, as protecting the well-being of children. It is\noften argued that it is wrong to bring a child with a disability into\nthe world if we can prevent doing so (i.e. Savulescu 2001 and 2007,\nDavis 2001). However, this claim faces the much discussed\n\u201cnonidentity problem\u201d, which was introduced by Derek\nParfit (1976, 1984) and adapted to the reproductive ethics context by\nmany authors (e.g., Steinbock 2009, Wasserman 2005, Brock 1996) (see\nthe entry on \u201cThe Nonidentity Problem\u201d). In short, the\nproblem is that you cannot harm a non-existent person by bringing it\ninto existence, unless the person's life is so dreadful that\nnonexistence is preferable. That life with a disability or chronic\nillness is predictably worse than non-existence is not plausible for\nmost of the defects for which we test\u2014notably including Down\nsyndrome, which is the most common target for testing and abortion.\nSome philosophers take an antinatalist stance and argue that human\nlife in general is prima facie worse than non-existence (e.g., Benatar\n2006), but it is a far more widely held stance that bringing a child\ninto existence does not typically count as harming that child.\n\nThis may sound like a straightforward point, but it leads quickly to\nresults that many find philosophically puzzling or implausible. For\nexample, if a woman is carrying twins and requires a selective\nabortion, and one of the fetuses is known to have a serious anomaly\nwhile the other does not, many people feel it would be cruel to choose\nto keep the fetus with the anomaly. And yet, the fetus with the\nanomaly does not itself have the option of becoming an anomaly-free\nchild; it will either become a child with a disability or not exist at\nall. We can be doing this child no harm by choosing it over its\nhealthy twin, and its twin, if it counts as a being that can be harmed\nat all by being aborted, is not harmed in any extra way in virtue of\nhaving a twin who will live with an anomaly. Even more\ncounterintuitively: imagine that a woman is taking a medication that\nis almost sure to cause substantial limb deformities if she gets\npregnant while taking it, but that leaves her system completely within\n24 hours. Imagine also that she takes her last dose on Tuesday\nmorning. She wants a child, and finds herself with an opportunity to\nhave unprotected sex on Tuesday evening. She will have the same\nopportunity on Wednesday. If she has sexual intercourse and conceives\non Tuesday, her child will almost certainly suffer from limb\ndeformities. If she waits 24 hours, her child suffers no unusual\nrisks. Most of us feel that it would be callous and unethical of her\nto have unprotected sex on Tuesday. But why, exactly? Any child she\nconceives on Tuesday will have limb deformities, but its other\n\u2018option\u2019 is nonexistence, and limb deformities, while\nburdensome perhaps, certainly don't make a life not worth living. She\ndoes not wrong the child by having unprotected sex on\nTuesday. Nor does she harm any nonexistent child that she might have\nbrought into existence, limbs intact, on Wednesday, for you cannot\nharm a nonexistent being. Variations on this problem and its practical\nand theoretical implications have been widely discussed and continue\nto feature in heated debates in bioethics (e.g., Boonin 2014, McMillan\n2014, Jecker 2012)\n\nIndeed, even going out of one's way to create a disabled child\n(through genetic engineering, selective abortion, or preimplantation\ngenetic diagnosis) cannot count as harming the child, since that\nparticular child has no options for existing other than as disabled.\n(This issue has most often come up with respect to deaf parents, who\nsometimes prefer to have a deaf child, e.g. in Wasserman and Asch\n2012). And yet, many writers have the strong intuition that\nintentionally creating a disabled child is a wrong done to the\nchild\u2014for instance, Dena Davis (2001) argues that since\ndisabilities generally close down possible ways of living,\nintentionally creating a disabled child violates the child's right to\nan open future. The non-identity problem forces us to search for an\nexplanation of what sort of wronging or rights violation this could\nbe, given that this child could have no non-disabled future\nopen to her to start with.\n\nResponses to the non-identity problem, then, may conclude that (1)\nindeed there is no wrong done by bringing someone into the world in a\nway that compromises her opportunities for flourishing (Heyd 2009), or\nthat (2) the wrong involved is not one done to the\nchild\u2014for instance, it might be wrong on roughly\nconsequentialist grounds (Brock 1995), because it promotes problematic\nvalues or reflects unacceptable motivations (Kumar 2003), or because\nit fails to promote the interests of an alternative possible child\n(Holtug 2009), or (3) that the non-identity problem is illusory, and\nthat someone can indeed be harmed by being brought into existence\n(Benatar 2006, Harman 2004). As Roberts and Wasserman (2009) note,\ndifferent strategies for resolving the non-identity problem emerge\nfrom different accounts of harm\u2014e.g. as concerning states of\naffairs, or as (uniquely) concerning identifiable\nindividuals\u2014and will therefore have distinctive implications for\nobligations of beneficence and non-maleficence in reproduction. For\nsome commentators, however, debate surrounding the non-identity\nproblem carries tenuous import for real-life procreative\ndecision-making, and offers little help to prospective parents in\naddressing the ethical challenges associated with reproduction (e.g.\nOverall 2012, 154). A strategy for addressing the non-identity\nproblem, then, is not equivalent to a strategy for addressing the\nchallenges of harms and benefits to future children for prospective\nparents. (See the entry on\n parenthood and procreation\n for further discussion). \n2.1.3 Social Concerns\n\nMany have worried that the increasing routinization of prenatal\ntesting is tantamount to eugenics. As the term is paradigmatically\nused, eugenics involves an intentional, top-down planned social\nprogram for engineering an entire population so as to eliminate or\npropagate particular traits. John Robertson (1996, 2003), who defends\na strong version of the right to procreative liberty, defends prenatal\ntesting against charges that it should be understood as ethically\nequivalent to eugenics by emphasizing the role of individual,\nautonomous parental choices in controlling this technology. Likewise,\nthose supporting a moral obligation to have children with the best\npossible lives using available technological means tend to\nsimultaneously emphasize the individual, personal nature of\nprocreative decision-making (Mills 2011). Yet some doubt that any\ngenuine procreative freedom is preserved when prenatal testing is\ntreated as required (e.g., Sparrow 2011). Moreover, many have argued\nthat as our culture increasingly values and takes for granted the\npower to control whether our offspring have particular traits, a kind\nof bottom-up eugenics will be instituted. Declining control and\naccepting devalued traits in our children will become a less socially\nacceptable choice for prospective parents, and some homogenization of\nthe gene pool and elimination of diversity will emerge regardless of\nwhether this is anyone's planned agenda (Tremain 2006, Rothschild\n2005). Furthermore, while individual parents may be free to decide\nwhether or not to avail themselves of tests, which tests we make\navailable will almost surely reflect and entrench existing social\nnorms that tell us what count as valuable and disvaluable traits\n(Sparrow 2007). Thus, the argument goes, individual decisions to use\nthese tests will collectively instantiate a eugenic project of\ndesigning a population that reflects these values, even if this\nproject does not belong to any centralized intentional agent. On the\nother hand, it seems that we already engage in such\n\u2018bottom-up\u2019 eugenics by taking steps to have children with\nvalued traits: pregnant women take folic acid in order to avoid having\na child with Spina Bifida, we try to find successful and attractive\nmates, and so forth (Mahowold 2002). Hence we need to settle whether\nmaking prenatal testing widely available introduces eugenics in a new\nand problematic way, and if so, whether this worry is sufficient to\noverride its advantages.\n\nThere are additional reasons to worry about the distortion of the gene\npool that may result from long-term, routine prenatal testing. In a\nclassic paper, \u201cMoral Issues in Human Genetics\u201d, Ruth\nMacklin (1977) points out that homogenizing or otherwise manipulating\nthe gene pool may have dangerous effects that we do not presently\nunderstand and can't foresee. We don't know enough about how specific\ngenes and mutations work to understand how they may be advantageous or\ndisadvantageous at the population level. Furthermore, in eliminating a\nparticular individual with some specific trait, we might be\naccidentally eliminating someone who has other traits that would have\nmade her an exceptionally valuable member of society and contributor\nto the gene pool. (What if we had selectively aborted Abraham Lincoln\nin virtue of his Marfan syndrome, she asks? The fact that Lincoln\nprobably did not have Marfan syndrome is beside the point.)\n\nAssuming that we believe that some, but not all, prenatal tests should\ncontinue to be available, at least in certain circumstances, we need\nto ask a host of more specific questions. We need to decide which\ntraits and conditions we ought to be testing for (perhaps\nincurable and painful life-shortening diseases such as Tay-Sachs;\nperhaps a broader set of traits) and which traits it is\npermissible to test for (perhaps less serious conditions such\nas Down syndrome and Huntington's disease; perhaps a wide variety of\nnon-medical traits). We need to settle which, if any, of these tests\nwill be covered by insurance (as prenatal testing for Down syndrome,\nultrasound screening, and other tests currently are), and how we want\nto manage the consequences of prenatal testing for later insurability.\nWe need to decide whether procreative liberty and privacy rights give\nparents the right to test their fetuses for what we might consider\nmorally unacceptable reasons\u2014for example, in order to abort\ntheir fetus if it has a \u2018gay gene\u2019, should such a thing be\ndiscovered. We also need to consider the consequences of prenatal\ntesting for genes that probabilistically raise the risk of developing\na condition (such as obesity or breast cancer) rather than determining\nthat it will be present. Finally, we must decide how we will manage\nand control the genetic information that results from prenatal tests,\nwhich can have significant consequences for other, genetically related\nfamily members who might have a strong stake in knowing or in\nnot knowing this information. All of these questions are receiving\nvigorous discussion in bioethics; disagreements have pervaded\ndiscussions among scholars, health care practitioners, and disability\nadvocates. (A classic source that discusses all the above issues is\nBuchanan et al. 2000. Other widely cited authors and collections\ncontributing to these discussions include Harris 2010 and Shakespeare\n2006.)\n2.1.4 The Disability Rights Critique of Prenatal Testing\n\nThe disability critique of prenatal testing constitutes a large,\nloosely bound cluster of arguments that draw upon disability rights\ntheory and activism in order to critically question the increased\nroutinization of prenatal testing and selective abortion (Asch and\nWasserman 2015, Parens and Asch 2000). In general terms, the\ndisability rights critique raises the worry that prenatal testing and\nselective abortion risk further stigmatizing disabled people, reducing\nthem to a single defining trait, and harming disability communities.\nIt points out that the offer of a prenatal test for a\nparticular trait is never neutral, but rather implies that a\nreasonable person might wish to know whether her fetus has this trait,\nand that this information might reasonably be the basis for a decision\nnot to continue the pregnancy. Although many contributors to the\ndisability rights critique of prenatal testing consider themselves\nfirmly in favor of general abortion rights, they share at least a\nprima facie worry about the ethics of aborting fetuses on the\nbasis of tests for future disability.\n\nThe disability critique of prenatal testing encompasses at least five\ntypes of arguments:\n\n\n\nEntrenchment of the Medical Model of Disability\n\nDisability theorists have most visibly distinguished between the\nmedical and the social model of disability, but sometimes use related\nlabels such as the metaphysical, the biological, and the political\nmodel of disability (for discussion see, e.g., Scully 2008,\nShakespeare and Watson 2001). According to the medical model, a\ndisability is a pathology or impairment of an individual body, in\nvirtue of which the disabled person is less able to perform various\nfunctions than the able-bodied person. Accordingly, since it is the\njob of medicine to fix bodies or at least minimize the undesirable\neffects of their medical conditions, it is appropriate for doctors to\nfix or mitigate disability when they can (Saxton 2000). According to\nthe social model, on the other hand, disability is inherently a\nrelational property: it concerns a more problematic than\nnormal fit between a body and its social and material environment.\nDisabilities are historically specific and context-dependent (Tremain\n2001). Someone who used a wheelchair in an environment in which\nall spaces accessible to any normal person are wheelchair\naccessible, the argument goes, would be no more disabled than is a\nresident of a sprawling American suburb who cannot obtain food or make\na living without driving her car. Myopia was a serious, even a\nlife-threatening disability in the hunter-gatherer era, but in the age\nof easily accessible effective eyeglasses most of us never even think\nto conceptualize our myopia as a disability.\n\nIf disability is a relational misfit between body and environment,\nthen mitigating or eliminating disability can be accomplished by\nchanging the body, the environment, or both. On this view, making\nspaces accessible to people with different means of mobility, ensuring\nthat everyone has access to text-based communication options, and\nworking to remove social stigmas concerning abnormal anatomy, for\nexample, literally lessen or remove disabilities such as mobility\nimpairment, deafness, and cleft palate rather than merely\naccommodating them. (This is not to say that all disabilities\nare such that we could design an environment that would substantially\nmitigate them.) In the proper environment, what might otherwise be a\ndisability can just be a difference, a human variation that can\nenhance the diversity of our culture (Wendell 1996). Once we accept\nthis, then we are faced with a choice when it comes to managing a\nparticular disability: we can try to change bodies, social and\nmaterial environments, or a combination of these, and it is an open\nquestion in each case which is the most effective and ethical\napproach.\n\nThe routinization of prenatal testing arguably institutionalizes the\nidea that disability is a medical condition detected at the level of\nthe individual body. Furthermore, insofar as the standard response to\nprenatal testing is abortion, it entrenches the practice of\n\u2018fixing\u2019 disability through a medical\nintervention\u2014specifically, the extreme intervention of simply\neliminating the disabled body. According to the disability rights\ncritique, this limits our ability to imagine addressing and\nalleviating disability at the social level. Yet in at least some\ncases, social approaches to disability have proven enormously\neffective. Consider Down syndrome, which is the main condition for\nwhich prenatal testing has become routine: Due to increased\nintegration into families and schools, better support and education,\nchanging expectations, and other social changes, people with Down\nsyndrome now often have life spans and a level of independence and\neducational achievement that were inconceivable fifty years ago.\nMoreover, as Sophia Isako Wong illustrates, the social model's\nencouragement of integration, understanding, and acceptance may have\nsignificant positive impacts on non-disabled individuals, and on\ncommunities more generally (2002). Thus disability theorists and\nadvocates urge us to reject the assumption that prenatal testing and\nabortion should be the default \u2018solution\u2019 to\ndisability. \n\n\nWeakening the Disability Community\n\nTo the extent that prenatal testing and abortion for a particular\ncondition become routinized, there will be fewer people born with that\ncondition. Insofar as prenatal testing and abortion are generally\ncheaper and easier than social interventions, over the long term they\nmay come to be seen as the only responsible and socially supported\noption. This threatens the quality of life and availability of\nresources for those who remain. They may be faced with increased\nstigmatization, less possibility for community, and less tolerance and\nunderstanding. Some commentators, however, deny that things have\ngotten worse for people with disabilities since selective abortion of\nfetuses with impairments has gained popularity (e.g. Overall 2012,\n166). And if efforts to accommodate persons with impairments are\nincreasing, charges against prenatal testing for further weakening and\nmarginalizing the disability community may be complicated if not\ndiminished. Nevertheless, the fruits of those efforts at accommodation\nare not enjoyed equally by all. For instance, the rarer a condition\nis, the less social and political motivation will exist to provide\nresources, support, tailored educational activities, and the like for\nthose who have it. \n\n\nOur Current Counseling Practices Distort Decision-Making\n\nCurrently, a large majority of pregnant women who are offered standard\nprenatal screens and tests accept them, and the majority of those who\nreceive abnormal test results proceed to abort. However, current\ncounseling surrounding the tests does not include any exposure to\npeople who have the tested-for conditions or any discussion of the\nsocial resources available for families with children with the\nconditions. Even supposedly nondirective counseling often uses\nstigmatizing language to talk about disability and the choice not to\nabort a fetus with a disabling trait, and reflects unsupported\nnegative judgments regarding the abilities of and quality of life for\npersons with disabilities (Asch 2000, Madeo et al. 2011). Different\nforms of counseling might enable more informed decision-making and\nyield fewer choices to test and fewer choices to abort after testing.\nFor instance, Bonnie Steinbock (2007) argues that prenatal testing\npractices for some conditions could be geared towards helping parents\nprepare for the birth of a child with that condition, rather than\nframed as preludes to a decision about abortion. In order for\ngenuinely informative and trusting interactions to take place between\ncounselors and prospective parents, however, counselors must be\nequipped with \"disability competencies,\" which involve experience with\ndisabilities and understanding of how various disabilities affect\nlives and families; improving counseling practices will require\nmandatory training in these areas (Sanborn and Patterson 2014).\n\n\n\nThe Expressivist Argument\n\nThis argument holds that prenatal testing, particularly as linked with\nselective abortion, has expressive meaning for\neveryone with that condition. Abby Lippman writes:\n\u201cThat the birth of certain babies should be avoided is announced\nmerely by making testing available\u201d (1994, 24). If we abort a\nfetus on the basis of a single trait, this symbolically suggests that\nnot only this fetus's life but the life of anyone who has\nthis trait is not worth living or preserving. Prenatal genetic\ntesting, as disability rights critics suggest, thus perpetuates and\nreinforces denigrating social attitudes toward persons with\ndisabilities (e.g. Saxton 2000). One might argue that any use\nof prenatal testing for a condition followed by abortion expressively\ndevalues that condition. Or, one might argue that it is the\nroutinization of testing\u2014the practice of checking for a\ncondition and making abortion available as a \u2018normal\u2019 part\nof \u2018responsible\u2019 prenatal care\u2014is what has\nexpressive devaluing significance.\n\nNot all disability theorists agree that prenatal testing does indeed\nsend a discriminatory message, or that it expresses anything specific\nat all (e.g. Malek 2010). James Nelson (2000) tells the story of\nchoosing to get a vasectomy after his third child. He argues it seems\nimplausible to understand his act as having an expressive significance\nthat devalues all fourth-children. Rather, his act may just\n\u2018mean\u2019 that, in context, having a fourth child is not the\nbest choice for his family. Whenever we decide not to have a child, he\nargues, we always do so based on some specific\nfeatures it would have, such as adding to a large family with strained\nresources. Likewise, he claims, choosing not to carry a pregnancy to\nterm after a prenatal test revealing a particular condition may\nreflect a judgment about particular circumstances rather than\nexpressing a general attitude towards people with that condition.\n\nAdrienne Asch (2000) responds that one cannot relevantly compare the\nproperty of being a fourth child to the property of having a specific\ndisabling trait, because the latter is an inherent rather than a\nrelational property of the child. Hence to abort on the basis of the\ndisabling trait is to reject that kind of person in a different and\nstronger way. But Asch's response seems to push against one of the\nmain points of the social model of disability, which she otherwise\ndefends: the view that disabilities are also relational rather than\ninherent properties. More generally, the force of the expressivist\nobjection may rely on a view of disabling traits as identity\nconstituting, thereby endorsing an essentialist understanding of\ndisability (Edwards 2004). For many, it seems possible to decide\nagainst bearing a child who has a property that in context\nwill make that child more difficult to raise (whether it is deafness,\na chromosomal disorder, or fourth-childness), without devaluing all\npeople with that property in any decontextualized way. Notice that\nthis response does not combat the idea that routinization is\nexpressively devaluing of some lives, even if it convinces us that\nindividual uses of the technology are not. \n\n\nParental Attitudes and Responsibilities\n\nSome disability rights critics suggest that prenatal genetic testing\nencourages an inappropriately commodifying and perfectionist approach\nto potential children, and stultifies parental expression of\nunconditional love and commitment (Asch and Wasserman 2005). By\nallowing particular traits to determine reproductive decision-making,\npotential parents adopt an attitude of conditional acceptance that is\ndirectly at odds with the nurturing and devotion children need to\nflourish. Others, however, question the requirement of so-called\nunconditional love, given that this requirement has developed in a\ncontext where mothers are judged by the completeness of their\ncaregiving roles, and where other social factors impeding good care\nand acceptance are ignored (e.g. Gedge 2011).\n\nA familiar concern with the disability critique of prenatal testing is\nthat it asks too much from prospective parents. Even if there are good\nreasons to worry about the impact of widespread testing, it is hard to\ndeny that for many people, given the level of support and acceptance\navailable for families with disabled children, raising a child with a\ndisability can be a serious challenge. Asking parents to take on this\nchallenge so as to promote larger social goals may be unreasonable.\nYet some critics of prenatal testing reject the assumption that\nbearing and raising a child with a disability is inevitably more\nburdensome than raising a non-disabled child. Marsha Saxton, for\ninstance, counters the purportedly feminist endorsement of prenatal\ntesting that casts testing as a protective or even emancipatory tool\nfor women. She argues that it is not disability itself that burdens\nwomen who have disabled children, but rather the unjust circumstances\nof caregiving, where ongoing sacrifices are expected from mothers, and\ncommunity resources and support remain woefully inadequate (2000,\n2006). \n\n\nDisability theorists have worried that it seems nearly impossible, in\npractice, to draw a line between acceptable and unacceptable tests.\nNearly all scholars agree that testing for Tay-Sachs or other diseases\nthat lead to a short life filled with intense suffering and no hope of\na cure is ethically acceptable, and nearly all agree that testing for\nvanity traits such as eye color would be unacceptable. But when it\ncomes to deciding which conditions are \u2018serious\u2019 enough to\nwarrant the availability of prenatal tests, there is little agreement.\nAnywhere this line is drawn risks stigmatizing those with\n\u2018serious\u2019 conditions and belittling the challenges faced\nby those with \u2018unserious\u2019 conditions (Parens and Asch\n2000, Introduction). It also risks treating the\n\u2018seriousness\u2019 of a condition as a fixed medical fact\nrather than as a potentially socially malleable state of affairs. This\nis another reason that many scholars and advocates wish to emphasize\nthe stigmatization of particular traits and the layers of social and\neconomic injustice that exacerbate this stigmatization(e.g. Roberts\nand Jesudason 2013, Wasserman 2000).\n2.1.5 Non-Invasive Prenatal Testing\n\nThe recent advancement of so-called non-invasive prenatal testing\n(NIPT) has complicated existing ethical issues and introduced new ones\nin obstetrical care, and some believe that current normative\nframeworks for assessing prenatal testing are ill-equipped to navigate\nthese issues (Schmitz 2013). The past decade has seen enormous changes\nin testing technologies, and non-invasive prenatal testing is a\nstriking example of how rapidly new testing methods translate to\nclinical and commercial enterprise (Skirton and Patch 2013). Most NIPT\ntargets aneuploidy; some tests for monegenic disorders are also sought\nafter but development and clinical uptake of these is relatively slow\n(Chitty and Bianchi 2013).\n\nSeveral ethical concerns piggy back on those associated with prenatal\ntesting generally; for instance, earlier and less risky testing may\nfacilitate selective abortions, encourage the commodification of\nchildren, or, conversely, amplify the coercive technological force of\nprenatal testing as a medical intervention required for responsible\nparenting (de Jong and de Wert 2014). Each of these concerns picks up\non the likelihood of greater routinization of prenatal testing given\nthe tests' non-invasiveness, low medical risk to the pregnant woman\nand fetus, and high accuracy. Some commentators worry that these\nfeatures of NIPT, particularly its lower medical risk, may serve to\njustify loosening, limiting, or even discarding informed consent\nrequirements (e.g., Deans and Newson 2011). Other problems with\nincreased routinization may also include affirmation of\nanti-disability bias and devaluation of disabled lives, particularly\nregarding Down Syndrome (Kaposy 2013). NIPT carries most of the same\nethical issues as traditional testing and screening methods, and may\nexacerbate some.\n",
