The first, developed mainly by Uskali M\u00e4ki,\nis devoted to exploring the varieties of realism implicit in the\nmethodological statements and theoretical enterprises of economists\n(see M\u00e4ki 1990a, b, c, 2007, and Lehtinen, Kuorikoski and\nYlikoski 2012). The second, which is espoused by Tony Lawson and his\nco-workers, mainly at Cambridge University, derives from the work of\nRoy Bhaskar (1975) (see Lawson 1997, 2015, Bhaskar et al.\n1998, Fleetwood 1999, Brown and Fleetwood 2003, Ackroyd and Fleetwood\n2004, Edwards, Mahoney, and Vincent 2014). In Lawson\u2019s view, one\ncan trace many of the inadequacies of mainstream economics (of which\nhe is a critic) to an insufficient concern with ontology. In\nattempting to identify regularities on the surface of the phenomena,\nmainstream economists are doomed to failure. Economic phenomena are in\nfact influenced by a large number of different causal factors, and one\ncan achieve scientific knowledge only of the underlying mechanisms and\ntendencies, whose operation can be glimpsed intermittently and\nobscurely in observable relations. M\u00e4ki\u2019s and\nLawson\u2019s programs have little to do with one another, though\nM\u00e4ki (like Mill, Cartwright, and Hausman) shares Lawson\u2019s\nand Bhaskar\u2019s concern with underlying causal mechanisms.
