Philosophy\n\nPetrizi\u2019s commentary on Proclus\u2019s Elementatio\ntheologica consists of a Preface (Introduction) and the\ncommentaries to each chapter of this work. In Sh. Nutsubidze and S.\nKaukhchishvili\u2019s edition of Petrizi\u2019s Proclus\nCommentary, these commentaries are followed by an epilogue.\n\nIn his Introduction to the Elementatio theologica, Joane\nPetrizi reflects on the sense (the intentio) of this book,\nand sees it in the proof of \u2018the much discussed One\u2019\n(Petrizi, Commentaries, p. 149). Then he briefly treats the\npeculiarity of the One, which in his opinion is not identical with any\nbeing. The pure and genuine One must be examined and proved in\naccordance with the rules of syllogisms (Petrizi, Opera II,\np. 3). According to Petrizi\u2019s exegesis, this One is the crucial\nconcept in the overall process of grounding knowledge. If this\nprinciple is not provable, there are no incontrovertible propositions\nand the goal of gnoseology will not be reached. The One is the\nprinciple that makes knowledge possible.\n\nIn the first chapter of his Elementatio theologica, Proclus\ntreated the One as the origin of all modes of multiplicity. Petrizi\nfollows this in his commentary to this proposition, presenting the\narguments for Proclus\u2019s approach in his own way. Petrizi adheres\nprimarily to the basic axiom that the chain of beings requires an\norigin. Otherwise the universe would have its origin in an Other,\nwhich for its part would have to be the One inasmuch as the first\nprinciple (= the One) should comprise all entities of the cosmos\nwithout exception. The One as the cause and origin of being as such is\ndeemed to be the better, and takes on no qualities from what it\ncauses. This One alone confers selfness to all other entities because,\nas the generator and principle of everything that follows it, it is in\nneed of nothing.\n\nThe essential features of the One (goodness, unity) are visible in\neach creature. If the one were of the same value as the rest of being,\nthen cosmic harmony and its order would fail; furthermore, it would\nnot be possible to distinguish between the first and the\nlast in the series (Petrizi, Opera II, prop. 1, p.\n13). The universe would thus have no first and no\nlast reference point, no origin and no unities following it.\nIt is precisely on the impossibility of such an assumption that\nPetrizi\u2019s ontological reflections were based. In Petrizi\u2019s\nview, the One is identical with the Good. All Being presupposes the\nfirst Good because all creatures of nature participate in this good\nand only possess good qualities by virtue of their participation.\nBeing is not by its own nature the Good, but becomes a Good\nsubsequently, by participation in the One. Therefore, in\nPetrizi\u2019s view a distinction must be made between the Good\nin itself and good entities inasmuch as the former is above all\nnature and is a pure good in itself. Therefore, it is also the goal of\nall Being, which constantly strives for it inasmuch as each caused\nthing reverts to the cause (Petrizi, Opera II, prop. 8, p.\n33).\n\nThe Good is the archetype of Being as such, which, as its image, also\nderives its status in the cosmos through participation in the Good.\nThis is so because of the identity of the Good with the One. Because\nall entities only appear by virtue of participation in the One, and\nbecause the One, taken in itself, is a pure Good, the Good is also\ndeemed to be the ultimate source and the super-simple reference point\nof the universe. To characterize the Good, Petrizi adduces and uses\nprinciples from Plato\u2019s Phaedrus, treating the various\ndegrees of goodness. The first Good heads the Good, and thereafter\nfollow the various levels of goodnesses. The good is also deemed to be\nthe principle of order and structuring of Being. That which is first\nto be linked to it has traces of the Good in itself, and the\nfirst monads also have such a nature. It is precisely in these first\nentities that Beauty and the Good are found (Petrizi, Opera\nII, prop. 8, p. 34).\n\nIn his Proclus Commentary, Joane Petrizi analyses the\ndialectic hidden in the \u2018cause\u2019 and the\n\u2018caused\u2019 more thoroughly and in more detail than does\nProclus himself in the corresponding chapters of his Elementatio\ntheologica. In Petrizi\u2019s exegesis, the abstract,\nmathematical style of this work is augmented in content with a wealth\nof material. Petrizi operates very often with visually illustrative\nexamples, and is careful to illuminate the theorems set forth in the\nElementatio theologica by means of human experience. This\nresulted from the goals of his Interpretation. It primarily\naddressed a broad public and served the study of this significant work\nfrom Greek antiquity.\n\nPetrizi treats the problem of the cause and the caused from various\nperspectives, for the treatment of this topic proved to be of\nfundamental importance for the logical structure of his philosophical\nproject. In Proposition 30, he treats the traditional view of the\ndialectic of causality in detail, examining the etymological meanings\nof the terms characteristically used in Greek for this relationship\n(Petrizi, Opera II, prop. 30, pp. 79\u201381). The dialectic\nof causality becomes manifest in the process of the descent from the\nOne to the Many and the ascent from the Many to the One. The cause is\nthe phase within the entirety of emanation that generates, that which\nthus has priority both in ontological and in axiological terms\nvis-\u00e0-vis the caused inasmuch as in the neo-Platonic system of\ngeneration the generator is better than the generated.\n\nWith regard to the problem of causality, Petrizi applied the criticism\nof the Peripatetic doctrine of principles in critical discussion of\nthe Aristotelian concept of causes. In the realm of theoretical\nphilosophy, the system of four causes proved to be inadequate and\nflawed. In this context, it seemed to Petrizi to be necessary to work\nout a new conception of causality. He studied Proclus\u2019s\nphilosophy on the basis of Greek sources, and regarded it as\nappropriate to his research goals to adopt the existing structure of\nthe system of causes. In this point, he worked in the same way as\nByzantine philosophers of the time such as Psellos and Italos, who\nrecognized the priority of Platonic philosophy on this issue.\n\nIn Proposition 75 of his commentary, Petrizi distinguishes five\ndifferent modes of causa, characterizing them in\nnuce. He adds a fifth kind of causa to the traditional\nsystem of causes. In addition to the material, formal, final and\nefficient causes he conceives a creative cause (Petrizi, Opera\nII, prop. 75, p. 136). It was, he claims, neglected in the\nAristotelians\u2019 theoretical work, who, in contrast to Proclus,\nhad underestimated the relevance of the creative cause. This applies\nboth to Aristotle and to his interpreters, above all Alexander of\nAphrodisias, whom Petrizi criticizes in this connection (Petrizi,\nOpera II, prop. 11, p. 38).\n\nOne of the most important aspects of Petrizi\u2019s philosophy is his\nepistemology. It has only recently been reconstructed and\nsystematically researched in the light of the medieval discussion of\nthe essence of thought (cf. Iremadze 2004a, 161\u2013241). In his\nepistemology, Petrizi emphasizes the productive power of (human)\nreason, which is capable of the real positing of being as such and is\nthus a determinative principle of being.\n",
