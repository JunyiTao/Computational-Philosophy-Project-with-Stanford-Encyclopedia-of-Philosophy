    "main_text": "The phenomenology of religious experience || Religious experience as encounter with God\n1.1 Religious experience as encounter with God\n\nWilliam Alston (1991, Chapter 1) has noted that we don\u2019t have a\nwell-developed vocabulary for the description of the phenomenal qualia\nof \u201cmystical\u201d experience. (Compare William James\u2019s\nsuggestion that \u201cmystical\u201d experiences are\n\u201cineffable\u201d: 1902, p. 380.) If someone takes God\u2019s\ngoodness to be displayed in, say, a mountain landscape, then the\nphenomenology of their experience can perhaps be set down easily\nenough, at least in some central respects; but what about the case\nwhere an experience is said to be more directly of God (the case that\nAlston intends to pick out by the expression \u201cmystical\nperception\u201d)? Alston suggests that our inability to describe the\nelements of such experiences from a phenomenological point of view\ndoes not imply that they lack a distinctive phenomenology, or that\nthey fail to be directed at some mind-independent reality, in rather\nthe way that sense experiences are.\n\nWe lack a relevant vocabulary, he argues, because we cannot construct\nany simple correlation between a range of \u201cstimulus\nconditions\u201d for mystical perception and the kinds of experience\nthat are likely to arise under those conditions. And therefore we\ncannot refine a vocabulary for the description of mystical experience\nby replication of relevant conditions and renewed attention to the\nphenomenology of the experiences that occur under those conditions. By\ncontrast, there is in general no difficulty in specifying the\nphenomenology of an experience of, say, turning one\u2019s face into\na breeze, because it is easy to recreate the stimulus conditions for\nsuch an experience, and we can therefore attend repeatedly to the\ncharacter of the experience. And since others can also do this, we can\nestablish a public language for the description of such\nexperiences.\n\nThis difficulty in identifying the stimulus conditions for mystical\nperception in no way impugns its epistemic worth, Alston thinks,\nbecause God is said to be a personal reality, and an experience of\nGod\u2019s presence cannot be brought about, therefore, in some\nrelatively mechanical way, simply by creating an appropriate set of\nsensory or other conditions. (Compare O\u2019Hear 1984, Chapter 2.)\nSo given what we mean by \u201cGod,\u201d it is only to be expected\nthat mystical perception will fail to yield a vocabulary that will\nallow us to specify at all precisely a correlative phenomenology. In\nother words, even if (perhaps especially if) mystical perception is\nveridical, we should not expect to have such a vocabulary.\nAccordingly, the absence of the vocabulary cannot be thought to\nconstitute an objection to the good epistemic standing of such\nexperiences.\n\nNotwithstanding these considerations, Alston and other commentators\nhave noted that in the Christian mystical tradition anyway there is,\nin fact, quite a well developed vocabulary for describing the\nsubjective quality of such experiences. This vocabulary is modelled on\nthat of ordinary sense perception. So there are \u201cspiritual\nsensations\u201d of touch, sight, taste, smell and hearing that are\ntaken to be in some way analogous to their counterparts in ordinary\nsense perception. As Nelson Pike (1992) notes, this tradition has\ncommonly distinguished three varieties of experience of God: those\nassociated with the \u201cprayer of quiet,\u201d the \u201cprayer\nof union,\u201d and \u201crapture,\u201d in order of increasing\nintimacy of acquaintance with God. And each of these phases of the\nspiritual life, it has been said, is to be associated with its own\ndistinctive phenomenology.\n\nFor example, speaking of the \u201cprayer of quiet,\u201d Pike\ncomments that in such experiences\n\nphenomenologically, God is located in that place within the body where\none normally experiences oneself to be. \u2026 the spiritual\nsensations involved are akin to ordinary auditory and olfactory\nperceptions as well as to ordinary perceptions of heat. They do not\ninclude sensations akin to those associated with inside or outside\ntouch or to those connected with taste. (1992, p. 159)\n\n\nOf course, even this vocabulary can only carry a person so far towards\nan understanding of the phenomenology of the experiences that are here\nbeing described, because the vocabulary is, after all, only patterned\non that which applies in ordinary sense experience. So to ascertain\nmore exactly the nature of these \u201cspiritual sensations\u201d it\nwould be necessary to experience them firsthand (Pike 1992, p. 161).\nNonetheless, the convergence of mystical testimony upon some such set\nof descriptions gives us a reason to think that these experiences,\nlike ordinary sense experiences, can be ordered in ways that admit of\na degree of inter-personal confirmation \u2014 and that there is a\nkind of correlation between the \u201cangle of view\u201d one takes\nup in relation to the purported object of the experience\n(corresponding to one\u2019s progression through the spiritual life,\nand one\u2019s degree of closeness to God) and the phenomenology of\nthe associated experience. (For further discussion of the\n\u201cspiritual senses\u201d tradition, see Gavrilyuk and Coakley\n2012, and Aquino and Gavrilyuk 2022.)\n\nThese observations suggest another response to the objection that\nmystical perception is epistemically defective because we lack a\nreliable vocabulary for the description of the phenomenology of such\nexperiences. On the contrary, it may be said, there is such a\nvocabulary, albeit that it is not as developed or its full meaning as\ngenerally accessible as the vocabulary that we use for the description\nof the phenomenology of ordinary sensory experience.\n\nSome commentators have sought to distinguish between the component of\na report of a religious experience that is a record of its\nphenomenology and the component that involves an interpretation of the\nexperience according to some favoured doctrinal scheme (Stace 1961).\nAs Pike notes, it is possible in principle that whole traditions of\nmystical experience have been more concerned to communicate the\ndoctrinal implications of such experience rather than its\nphenomenological content (1992, p. 174), and that they have adopted a\nvocabulary for talking about the experiences that will suit this\npurpose. But in light of the language of \u201cspiritual\nsensations\u201d we may (with Pike) doubt that this is the right way\nto understand the Christian mystical tradition. At least some strands\nof this tradition seem to display a keen interest in recording the\nphenomenology of various experiences. (See Turner 1995 for a\ncontrasting, non-experientialist reading of Christian mystical\nwriting.)\n\nAnd there is a ready \u201cspiritual\u201d explanation of why there\nshould be such an interest: so that the believer can track their\nprogress through the spiritual life. Where the \u201cordinary\nbeliever\u201d is concerned, such progress is not likely to involve\nsome abstractly intellectual kind of achievement, and on some\napproaches anyway, it is not likely to involve some new proximity to\nGod that can be specified independently of changes in the\nphenomenology of one\u2019s experience. So in these cases, the\nphenomenology serves to reassure the believer of their growing\ncloseness to God.\n\nSuch an approach can admit of corruptions, as when the believer seeks\nout certain exalted experiences, and takes pride in them because they\nare thought to signify intimacy with God, or perhaps takes pleasure in\nthem simply because of their thrilling or in other ways pleasing\nphenomenological feel. David Pugmire (1998) speaks of\n\u201cdramaturgical\u201d and \u201cnarcissistic\u201d cases of\nemotional experience where, respectively, the emotion is taken to\nsignify one\u2019s superior status in some respect, or where it is\nvalued because of its pleasant phenomenological feel. And we might\nthink of some religious experiences in similar terms. However, these\ncases are presumably corruptions, and the tradition that has evolved\nthe language of \u201cspiritual sensations\u201d need not as such\nhave any tendency to value religious experience for these reasons.\n\nIndeed, in so far as spiritual sensations are prized for these reasons\n\u2014 because of their phenomenological feel or as a way of\nunderwriting a person\u2019s sense of their own importance \u2014\nthen they will be religiously defective (given the religious\nimportance of the virtue of humility for example); and they are also\nlikely to be epistemically defective, because of the suspicion that\nthe believer, whether consciously or not, is engineering the\nproduction of such experiences for the advantages that they confer in\nthese respects. It is in part for these reasons that there exists a\nvery broadly based tradition of testing religious experiences by their\nfruits in practice. An experience that fails to issue in a livelier\nregard for the interests of one\u2019s neighbour, for example, is to\nthat extent disconfirmed on religious grounds (Alston 1991, pp.\n250\u2013254).\n\nIt is worth noting, with Pike, that even if a description of a\nreligious experience employs a relatively theoretical or\nmetaphysically loaded vocabulary, rather than simply using the\nlanguage of sensation, it does not follow that this is an\ninterpretation of the experience rather than an attempt to communicate\nits phenomenological content: it may be, for example, that one\u2019s\nexperience is as of being appeared to by a very powerful spiritual\nbeing, rather than simply a matter of certain sensations of heat,\ntouch or whatever being undergone, which are then interpreted on the\nbasis of some doctrinal scheme.\n\nSome commentators have argued on the contrary that the theistic\nmeaning of an experience cannot be given directly in its\nphenomenology, since \u201cit\u2019s God\u201d or \u201cit\u2019s\nomnipotent\u201d can never be part of the phenomenology of an\nexperience but must involve some interpretation of the phenomenology\n(Forgie 1984 and Zangwill 2004). Whatever stance one takes here, it\nwill be necessary to acknowledge that in ordinary sense experience we\ncommonly recognise someone without reliance upon inference, rather\nthan starting from some set of minimally interpreted sensations\n(patches of colour and so on) and inferring that the presence of this\nperson in particular would best explain these phenomena.\n\nSome scholars have sought to apply the distinction between experience\nand interpretation to theistic mysticism in particular, arguing that\ntheistic mystical experiences have the same content as non-theistic\nmystical experiences, and are just differently interpreted and\nreported, because in all cases mystical experience is experience of\n\u201cundifferentiated unity\u201d (Stace 1961, p. 236). (The\nthought is that mystics who are orthodox theists have had to reckon\nwith the teaching that there is an ineradicable ontological\ndistinction between creature and creator, and this requirement has\nshaped their reports.) And some have wondered whether\n\u201cintrovertive\u201d mystical experiences in all traditions (as\ndistinct from \u201cextrovertive\u201d mystical experiences, where\nmaterial objects are experienced as one) are devoid of any\nphenomenological content, in so far as \u201cwhat emerges is a state\nof pure consciousness: \u2018pure\u2019 in the sense that it is not\nthe consciousness of any empirical content. It has no content except\nitself\u201d (Stace, p. 86). It is tempting to represent such\nexperiences in these terms in part, no doubt, because any attribution\nof a phenomenological content to an experience is likely to imply a\nsubject-object structure (to imply some account of how something\nseemed to the subject of the experience), so contradicting the\npurported, non-dualistic content of an introvertive mystical\nexperience. (Compare Plotinus on union with the One in\nEnneads VI.9.11.)\n\nOther commentators have rejected the idea that mystics across\ntraditions have experiences that are subjectively the same, but just\ndifferently reported. On the contrary, they say, the categories of a\nfaith tradition will make a difference not simply to the ways in which\nexperiences are reported, but to the character of the experience\nitself (Katz 1978).\n\nJohn Hick\u2019s (1989) study is a particularly influential\napplication of this Kantian sort of perspective within the domain of\nreligious experience. Hick argues that religious experiences are\nstructured according to tradition-specific sets of religious concepts.\nOn this view, all the major faiths offer a way of encountering one and\nthe same ultimate religious reality \u2014 but Christians encounter\nthis reality, in their religious experience, in Trinitarian mode,\nwhile Hindus encounter it as Brahman, and so on.\n\nHick is clear that this is not a matter of the advocates of the\nvarious faiths having an experience whose phenomenological content is\nmuch the same across the traditions, but just differently interpreted\nand differently reported; rather, tradition-specific concepts (such as\nthose of the Trinity and Brahman) enter into the content of the\nexperience. Analogously, we might say that there is a sense in which a\nnewborn infant and I have the same experience when we look out upon a\nroom of tables and chairs, in so far as the same image is imprinted on\nour retinas; but we would presumably wish to say that the\nphenomenology of these experiences remains quite different even so,\nand that only I have an experience that seems to be of tables and\nchairs, and in which my visual field is organised accordingly (so that\nregions of colour are sorted into table- and chair-like\nconfigurations).\n\nThis account of religious experience and the contribution of doctrine\nin shaping its phenomenology sits very well with Hick\u2019s\npluralistic reading of the major faiths. On this view, these\ntraditions are all valid in so far as all provide a vehicle for the\nexperience of ultimate religious reality or what Hick terms \u201cthe\nReal\u201d (an expression that is intended to be neutral between the\nvarious designations for this reality that are favoured by the\ndifferent traditions). And the traditions are indeed all equally valid\nin so far as there can be no question of the doctrinal content of any\none tradition\u2019s experience of the Real corresponding more\nclosely to the character of the Real \u201cin itself\u201d; rather,\nthe doctrinal content of such experiences derives in every case from\nthe side of culture or a person\u2019s religious formation, rather\nthan mapping the character of the Real in itself. Identifying the\nintrinsic character of the Real is beyond the scope of any human\nenquiry. Instead, we have to make do with appearances of the Real,\nwhere these appearances vary with the culturally constituted ways of\nbeing religious that are made available in the various faiths.\n\nOf course, this picture invites the objection that a culturally\nreductionist account of religious experience is surely then to be\npreferred: if the phenomenological content of religious experience is\nfixed in all its detail by a person\u2019s socio-religious context,\nthen why not think of such experience as simply a cultural product,\nrather than as having some culture-transcendent reference (Stoeber\n1992)? To shore up the claim of religious experience to connect the\nbeliever to a mind-independent reality we require, rather, some sort\nof convergence across traditions concerning the nature of the reality\nthat is revealed in such experiences \u2014 instead of Hick\u2019s\nrigorously agnostic (and therefore tradition-neutral) affirmation that\nthe Real in itself eludes all our categories, and so cannot be\nconsidered as personal or impersonal, one or many, or even good or\nevil. (Compare Byrne 1995.)\n\nHick\u2019s approach might also seem to be in trouble for more\nstraightforwardly religious reasons: as he notes, most believers\nprivilege the picture of the sacred that is favoured in their own\ntradition (rather than thinking of that picture as simply another way\nof representing an appearance of the Real). And perhaps this is\nreligiously necessary. If believers thought that their religious\nsymbols, and in turn the content of their religious experience, lacked\nany ultimate reference (since these symbols are concerned simply with\nthe realm of appearances), then it may be doubted whether they would\nbe adequately motivated to live religiously: if religious symbols are\ninterpreted in this agnostic way, and if the phenomenology of\nreligious experience fails therefore to track in any respect the\ncharacter of the Real in itself, then how is the Real to be\nintelligibly the object of a response of, say, love and faith, rather\nthan simply of bafflement or perhaps indifference?\n\nSo philosophical treatments of the phenomenology of religious\nexperience draw quite diverse conclusions: religious experience (in at\nleast some central cases) is said variously to have no\nphenomenological content (not to be like anything), or to have a\ncontent that at any rate cannot be communicated readily in verbal\nterms, or to have a phenomenological content that can be described\nbecause it is analogous to the \u201csensational\u201d quality of\nordinary sensory experience, where this content can then be\ninterpreted in doctrinal terms, or to have a phenomenological content\nthat is given in the doctrinal scheme of the relevant faith tradition,\nwhere this scheme functions rather like a lens through which religious\nreality is viewed, or to have a phenomenological content that never\ncomes clearly into view in public discourse, since reports of such\nexperiences typically focus upon the implied doctrinal meaning of the\nexperience which is, on this account, to be sharply distinguished from\nits phenomenological content.\n\nThese disputes sometimes have a relatively conceptual character, and\nsometimes are rooted more clearly in questions about how to read\nvarious bodies of documentary evidence. As we have seen, a\nperson\u2019s stance on these matters may well make a difference to\ntheir approach to other issues: including the question of whether\nreligious experience is discredited by the difficulties in describing\nits phenomenological content, and the questions of whether we should\nfavour a pluralist account of the faiths or a reductionist reading of\nreligious experience.\n",
