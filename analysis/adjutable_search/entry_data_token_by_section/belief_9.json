Generally speaking,\nacceptance is held to be more under the voluntary control of the\nsubject than belief and more directly tied to a particular practical\naction in a context. For example, a scientist, faced with evidence\nsupporting a theory, evidence acknowledged not to be completely\ndecisive, may choose to accept the theory or not to accept it. If the\ntheory is accepted, the scientist ceases inquiring into its truth and\nbecomes willing to ground their own research and interpretations in\nthat theory; the contrary if the theory is not accepted. If one is\nabout to use a ladder to climb to a height, one may check the\nstability of the ladder in various ways. At some point, one accepts\nthat the ladder is stable and climbs it. In both of these examples,\nacceptance involves a decision to cease inquiry and to act as though\nthe matter is settled. This does not, of course, rule out the\npossibility of re-opening the question if new evidence comes to light\nor new risks arise.\n\nThe distinction between acceptance and belief can be supported by\nappeal to cases in which one accepts a proposition without believing\nit and cases in which one believes a proposition without accepting it.\nVan Fraassen (1980) has argued that the former attitude is common in\nscience: the scientist often does not think that some particular\ntheory on which their work depends is the literal truth, and thus does\nnot believe it, but nonetheless they accept it as an adequate basis\nfor research. The ladder case, due to Bratman (1999), may involve\nbelief without acceptance: One may genuinely believe, even before\nchecking it, that the ladder is stable, but because so much depends on\nit and because it is good general policy, one nonetheless does not\naccept that the ladder is stable until one has checked it more\ncarefully.\n\nImportant discussions of acceptance include van Fraassen (1980),\nHarman (1986), Cohen (1989, 1992), Lehrer (1990), Bratman (1999),\nVelleman (2000), and Frankish (2004).\n",
