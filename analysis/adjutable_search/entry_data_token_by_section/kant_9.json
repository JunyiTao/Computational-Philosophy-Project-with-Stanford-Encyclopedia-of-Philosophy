    "main_text": "The transcendental deduction || Objectivity and judgment\n4.2 Objectivity and judgment\n\nOn the basis of this formal idealist conception of self-consciousness,\nKant\u2019s argument (at least one central thread of it) moves\nthrough two more conditions of self-consciousness in order to\nestablish the objective validity of the categories. The next condition\nis that self-consciousness requires me to represent an objective world\ndistinct from my subjective representations \u2013 that is, distinct\nfrom my thoughts about and sensations of that objective world. Kant\nuses this connection between self-consciousness and objectivity to\ninsert the categories into his argument.\n\nIn order to be self-conscious, I cannot be wholly absorbed in the\ncontents of my perceptions but must distinguish myself from the rest\nof the world. But if self-consciousness is an achievement of the mind,\nthen how does the mind achieve this sense that there is a distinction\nbetween the I that perceives and the contents of its perceptions?\nAccording to Kant, the mind achieves this sense by distinguishing\nrepresentations that necessarily belong together from representations\nthat are not necessarily connected but are merely associated in a\ncontingent way. Consider Kant\u2019s example of the perception of a\nhouse (B162). Imagine a house that is too large to fit into your\nvisual field from your vantage point near its front door. Now imagine\nthat you walk around the house, successively perceiving each of its\nsides. Eventually you perceive the entire house, but not all at once,\nand you judge that each of your representations of the sides of the\nhouse necessarily belong together (as sides of one house) and that\nanyone who denied this would be mistaken. But now imagine that you\ngrew up in this house and associate a feeling of nostalgia with it.\nYou would not judge that representations of this house are necessarily\nconnected with feelings of nostalgia. That is, you would not think\nthat other people seeing the house for the first time would be\nmistaken if they denied that it is connected with nostalgia, because\nyou recognize that this house is connected with nostalgia for you but\nnot necessarily for everyone. Yet you distinguish this merely\nsubjective connection from the objective connection between sides of\nthe house, which is objective because the sides of the house\nnecessarily belong together \u201cin the object,\u201d because this\nconnection holds for everyone universally, and because it is possible\nto be mistaken about it. The point here is not that we must\nsuccessfully identify which representations necessarily belong\ntogether and which are merely associated contingently, but rather that\nto be self-conscious we must at least make this general distinction\nbetween objective and merely subjective connections of\nrepresentations.\n\nAt this point (at least in the second edition text) Kant introduces\nthe key claim that judgment is what enables us to distinguish\nobjective connections of representations that necessarily belong\ntogether from merely subjective and contingent associations:\n\u201c[A] judgment is nothing other than the way to bring given\ncognitions to the objective unity of apperception. That is the aim of\nthe copula is in them: to distinguish the objective unity of\ngiven representations from the subjective. For this word designates\nthe relation of the representations to the original apperception and\nits necessary unity\u201d (B141\u2013142). Kant is speaking here\nabout the mental act of judging that results in the formation of a\njudgment. Judging is an act of what Kant calls synthesis, which he\ndefines as \u201cthe action of putting different representations\ntogether with each other and comprehending their manifoldness in one\ncognition\u201d (A77/B103). In other words, to synthesize is in\ngeneral to combine several representations into a single (more)\ncomplex representation, and to judge is specifically to combine\nconcepts into a judgment \u2013 that is, to join a subject concept to\na predicate concept by means of the copula, as in \u201cthe body is\nheavy\u201d or \u201cthe house is four-sided.\u201d Judgments need\nnot be true, of course, but they always have a truth value (true or\nfalse) because they make claims to objective validity. When I say, by\ncontrast, that \u201cIf I carry a body, I feel a pressure of\nweight,\u201d or that \u201cif I see this house, I feel\nnostalgia,\u201d I am not making a judgment about the object (the\nbody or the house) but rather I am expressing a subjective association\nthat may apply only to me\n (B142).[16]\n\nKant\u2019s reference to the necessary unity of apperception or\nself-consciousness in the quotation above means (at least) that the\naction of judging is the way our mind achieves self-consciousness. We\nmust represent an objective world in order to distinguish ourselves\nfrom it, and we represent an objective world by judging that some\nrepresentations necessarily belong together. Moreover, recall from\n 4.1\n that, for Kant, we must have an a priori capacity to represent the\nworld as law-governed, because \u201cwe can represent nothing as\ncombined (or connected) in the object without having previously\ncombined it ourselves\u201d (B130). It follows that objective\nconnections in the world cannot simply imprint themselves on our mind.\nRather, experience of an objective world must be constructed by\nexercising an a priori capacity to judge, which Kant calls the faculty\nof understanding (A80\u201381/B106). The understanding constructs\nexperience by providing the a priori rules, or the framework of\nnecessary laws, in accordance with which we judge representations to\nbe objective. These rules are the pure concepts of the understanding\nor categories, which are therefore conditions of self-consciousness,\nsince they are rules for judging about an objective world, and\nself-consciousness requires that we distinguish ourselves from an\nobjective world.\n\nKant identifies the categories in what he calls the metaphysical\ndeduction, which precedes the transcendental\n deduction.[17]\n Very briefly, since the categories are a priori rules for judging,\nKant argues that an exhaustive table of categories can be derived from\na table of the basic logical forms of judgments. For example,\naccording to Kant the logical form of the judgment that \u201cthe\nbody is heavy\u201d would be singular, affirmative, categorical, and\nassertoric. But since categories are not mere logical functions but\ninstead are rules for making judgments about objects or an objective\nworld, Kant arrives at his table of categories by considering how each\nlogical function would structure judgments about objects (within our\nspatio-temporal forms of intuition). For example, he claims that\ncategorical judgments express a logical relation between subject and\npredicate that corresponds to the ontological relation between\nsubstance and accident; and the logical form of a hypothetical\njudgment expresses a relation that corresponds to cause and effect.\nTaken together with this argument, then, the transcendental deduction\nargues that we become self-conscious by representing an objective\nworld of substances that interact according to causal laws.\n",
