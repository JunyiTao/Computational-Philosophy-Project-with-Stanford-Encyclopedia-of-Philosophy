    "main_text": "Objections Against Retrocausality in Quantum Mechanics || Retrocausality Requires Fine Tuning\n7.3 Retrocausality Requires Fine Tuning\n\nCausal modeling (Spirtes, Glymour, & Scheines 2000; Pearl 2009) is\na practice that has arisen from the field of machine learning that\nconsists in the development of algorithms that can automate the\ndiscovery of causes from correlations in large data sets. The causal\ndiscovery algorithms permit an inference from given statistical\ndependences and independences between distinct measurable elements of\nsome system to a causal model for that system. As part of the\nalgorithms, a series of constraints must be placed on the resulting\nmodels that capture general features that we take to be characteristic\nof causality. Two of the more significant assumptions are (i) the\ncausal Markov condition, which ensures that every statistical\ndependence in the data results in a causal dependence in the\nmodel\u2014essentially a formalization of Reichenbach\u2019s common\ncause principle\u2014and (ii) faithfulness, which ensures that every\nstatistical independence implies a causal independence, or no causal\nindependence is the result of a fine-tuning of the model.\n\nIt has long been recognized (Butterfield 1992; Hausman 1999; Hausman\n& Woodward 1999) that quantum correlations force one to give up at\nleast one of the assumptions usually made in the causal modeling\nframework. Wood and Spekkens (2015) argue that any causal model\npurporting to causally explain the observed quantum\ncorrelations must be fine-tuned (i.e., must violate the faithfulness\nassumption). More precisely, according to them, since the observed\nstatistical independences in an entangled bipartite quantum system\nimply no signaling between the parties, when it is then assumed that\nevery statistical independence implies a causal independence (which is\nwhat faithfulness dictates), it must be inferred that there can be no\n(direct or mediated) causal link between the parties. Since there is\nan observed statistical dependence between the outcomes of\nmeasurements on the bipartite system, we can no longer account for\nthis dependence with a causal link unless this link is fine tuned to\nensure that the no-signaling independences still hold. There is thus a\nfundamental tension between the observed quantum correlations and the\nno-signaling requirement, the faithfulness assumption and the\npossibility of a causal explanation.\n\nFormally, Wood and Spekkens argue that the following three assumptions\nform an inconsistent set: (i) the predictions of quantum theory\nconcerning the observed statistical dependences and independences are\ncorrect; (ii) the observed statistical dependences and independences\ncan be given a causal explanation; (iii) the faithfulness assumption\nholds. Wood and Spekkens conclude that, since the faithfulness\nassumption is an indispensable element of causal discovery, the second\nassumption must yield. The contrapositive of this is that any\npurported causal explanation of the observed correlations in an\nentangled bipartite quantum system falls afoul of the tension between\nthe no-signaling constraint and no fine tuning and, thus, must violate\nthe assumption of faithfulness. Such causal explanations, so the\nargument goes, including retrocausal explanations, should therefore be\nruled out as viable explanations.\n\nAs a brief aside, this fine-tuning worry for retrocausality in the\nquantum context arises in a more straightforward way. There is no good\nevidence to suggest that signaling towards the past is possible; that\nis, there is no retrocausality at the operational level. (Pegg 2006,\n2008 argues that this can be explained formally as a result of the\ncompleteness condition on the measurement operators, introducing an\nasymmetry in normalization conditions for preparation and\nmeasurement.) Yet, despite there being no signaling towards the past,\nretrocausal accounts assume causal influences towards past. That these\ncausal influences do not show up as statistical dependences\nexploitable for signaling purposes raises exactly the same fine-tuning\nworry as Wood and Spekkens raise.\n\nAn obvious response to the challenge set by Wood and Spekkens is to\nsimply reject the assumption of faithfulness. But this should not be\ntaken lightly; the intuition behind the faithfulness assumption is\nbasic and compelling. When no statistical correlation exists between\nthe occurrences of a pair of events, there is no reason for supposing\nthere to be a causal connection between them. Conversely, if we were\nto allow the possibility of a causal connection between statistically\nuncorrelated events, we would have a particularly hard task\ndetermining which of these uncorrelated sets could be harboring a\nconspiratorial causal connection that hides the correlation. The\nfaithfulness assumption is thus a principle of parsimony\u2014the\nsimplest explanation for a pair of statistically uncorrelated events\nis that they are causally independent\u2014much the same way that\nSpekkens\u2019 (2005) definition of contextuality is, too (see\n \u00a73.2);\n indeed, Cavalcanti (2018) argues that contextuality can be construed\nas a form of fine-tuning.\n\nThere are, however, well-known examples of systems that potentially\nshow a misapplication of the faithfulness assumption. One such\nexample, originating in Hesslow (1976), involves a contraceptive pill\nthat can cause thrombosis while simultaneously lowering the chance of\npregnancy, which can also cause thrombosis. As Cartwright (2001: 246)\npoints out, given the right weight for these process, it is\nconceivable that the net effect of the pills on the frequency of\nthrombosis be zero. This is a case of \u201ccancelling paths\u201d,\nwhere the effect of two or more causal routes between a pair of\nvariables cancels to achieve statistical independence. In a case such\nas this, since we can have independent knowledge of the separate\ncausal mechanisms involved here, there are grounds for arguing that\nthere really is a causal connection between the variables despite\ntheir statistical independence. Thus, it is certainly possible to\nimagine a scenario in which the faithfulness assumption could lead us\nastray. However, in defense of the general principle, an example such\nas this clearly contains what Wood and Spekkens refer to as fine\ntuning; the specific weights for these processes would need to match\nprecisely to erase the statistical dependence, and such a balance\nwould generally be thought as unstable (any change in background\nconditions, etc. would reveal the causal connection in the form of a\nstatistical dependence).\n\nN\u00e4ger (2016) raises the possibility that unfaithfulness can occur\nwithout conspiratorial fine tuning if the unfaithfulness arises in a\nstable way. In the quantum context, N\u00e4ger suggests that the\nfine-tuning mechanism is what he calls \u201cinternal cancelling\npaths\u201d. This mechanism is analogous to the usual cancelling\npaths scenario, but the path-cancelling mechanism does not manifest at\nthe level of variables, but at the level of values. On this view, such\nfine tuning would occur as a result of the particular causal and/or\nnomological process that governs the system, and it is in this sense\nthat the cancelling paths mechanism is internal, and it is the fact\nthat the mechanism is internal that renders the associated fine tuning\nstable to external disturbances. Thus \n\n\nif the laws of nature are such that disturbances always alter the\ndifferent paths in a balanced way, then it is physically impossible to\nunbalance the paths. (N\u00e4ger 2016: 26) \n\n\nThe possibility raised by N\u00e4ger would circumvent the problem that\nviolations of faithfulness ultimately undermine our ability to make\nsuitable inferences of causal independence based on statistical\nindependence by allowing only a specific kind of\nunfaithfulness\u2014a principled or law-based unfaithfulness that is\n\u201cinternal\u201d and is thus stable to background\nconditions\u2014which is much less conspiratorial, as the fine-tuning\nis a function of the specific process involved. Evans (2018) argues\nthat a basic retrocausal model of the sort envisaged by Costa de\nBeauregard (see\n \u00a71)\n employs just such an internal cancelling paths explanation to account\nfor the unfaithful (no signaling) causal channels. See also Almada et\nal. (2016) for an argument that fine tuning in the quantum context is\nrobust and arises as a result of symmetry considerations. Furthermore,\nEvans (2021) argues that, to the letter of Wood and Spekkens\u2019\nanalysis, cases of fine tuning may be more ubiquitous than we suspect,\nand so we should not be so worried about such quantum cases.\n",
