    "main_text": "The Variety of Reasons\n1. The Variety of Reasons\n\nHumans engage in practical reasoning: they deliberate about what to do\nand how to do it. And they often act in light of reasons which can\nthen explain their actions, and may also justify them.\nThese ideas go back to Plato (Protagoras and\nRepublic, Book 4) and Aristotle (De Anima, see esp.\nIII.10; see also Price 2011). They have been a constant theme in\ndiscussions of the character of human behaviour in the history of\nphilosophy. In the 18th century, David Hume and Immanuel\nKant offered radically different views about the role and importance\nof Reason (the faculty of reason) in guiding and justifying human\nactions. Their contributions remain influential today, but in the\nsecond half of the 20th century, the focus shifted from\ndiscussion of the faculty of reason to discussion of the very concept\nof a reason and to questions about different kinds of reasons and\ntheir interconnections.\n\nAs mentioned in the introduction, a distinction is commonly drawn in\ncontemporary debates between two kinds of reason:\n\u201cnormative\u201d and \u201cmotivating\u201d reasons. Jonathan\nDancy (2000: 20ff. and Appendix) discusses the history of this\ndistinction. It is sometimes said to date back to Francis Hutcheson\n(1730), though Dancy notes that the modern distinction does not\nclearly map on to earlier ones. Whatever its history, the distinction\nis now accepted by most if not all contemporary philosophers who write\non this topic (Raz 1975; Smith 1994; Parfit 1997; and Dancy 1995\nand 2000 are representative examples).\n\nA normative reason is a reason (for someone) to act\u2014in T. M.\nScanlon\u2019s phrase, \u201ca consideration that counts in favour\nof\u201d someone\u2019s acting in a certain way (1998 and 2004). A\nmotivating reason is a reason for which someone does something, a\nreason that, in the agent\u2019s eyes, counts in favour of her acting\nin a certain way. When an agent acts motivated by a reason, she acts\n\u201cin light of that reason\u201d and the reason will be a premise\nin the practical reasoning, if any, that leads to the action.\nMotivating reasons can also figure in explanations of actions that\ncite agents\u2019 reasons, what are called \u201creason\nexplanations\u201d of actions. Because of that, they are sometimes\ncalled \u201cexplanatory\u201d reasons, though we shall scrutinize\nthis description more carefully below.\n\nDancy suggests that the distinction between different types of reason\nis best understood as one between questions we can ask about them (a\nview that he finds also in Baier 1958):\n\n\nIf we do speak in this way, of motivating and normative reasons, this\nshould not be taken to suggest that there are two sorts of reason, the\nsort that motivate and the sort that are good. There are not. There\nare just two questions that we use the single notion of a reason to\nanswer. When I call a reason \u201cmotivating\u201d, all that I am\ndoing is issuing a reminder that the focus of our attention is on\nmatters of motivation, for the moment. When I call it\n\u201cnormative\u201d, again all that I am doing is stressing that\nwe are currently thinking about whether it is a good reason, one that\nfavours acting in the way proposed (Dancy 2000: 2\u20133).\n\n\nAccording to this suggestion, there is a single notion of a reason\nthat is used to answer different questions: the question whether there\nis a reason for someone to do something (normative) and the question\nwhat someone\u2019s reason for acting is (motivating). For instance,\nwe can ask whether there is a reason for the government of a country\nto tax sugary drinks (normative), and ask also for the\ngovernment\u2019s reason for actually taxing the drinks (motivating).\nThe same reason may answer both questions: the reason that favours\ntaxing the drink may be that the tax will help reduce child obesity;\nand that may also be the government\u2019s reason for taxing the\ndrinks. In that case, the government is motivated to tax drinks by a\nreason that there is for it to do so, the reason that may justify its\ndoing so. But we don\u2019t always act for the reasons that favour\nour actions. For instance, the government may tax sugary drinks\nbecause (or in part because) some of its members own shares in a\ncompany that sells low-sugar drinks. In that case, the reason for\nwhich the government decides to tax sugary drinks is not, or not\nsolely, the reason that favours its doing so. The distinction between\nnormative and motivating reasons, therefore, enables us to separate\nthe question what reasons motivate agents to act (a psychological\nquestion) and the question whether those are good reasons: reasons\nthat favour and justify their acting thus.\n\nIf this way of understanding talk about different kinds of reasons is\nright, perhaps the picture is more complex than the dichotomy of\n\u201cnormative vs. motivating\u201d suggests. For there seem to be\nat least three distinct questions about the relation between reasons\nand actions. There are questions about whether there is a reason that\nfavours someone\u2019s action; questions about what reason motivates\nsomeone to act; and also questions about what reasons explain his\naction. Consider the behaviour of Othello in Shakespeare\u2019s play\nof the same name. Othello kills Desdemona in the belief, induced by\nIago, that she has been unfaithful to him. The tragedy, however, is\nthat she has not: Desdemona is innocent, she loves Othello and is\nfaithful to him. Clearly, there is no reason that justifies the\nmurder: no normative reason. But there are two things we can say about\nOthello\u2019s reason for acting and his action. One is that Othello\nis motivated to kill Desdemona by the (putative) fact that Desdemona\nhas been unfaithful. The other is that we can explain his action of\nkilling her by citing the fact that he believes that Desdemona has\nbeen unfaithful. So here we seem to have two different reasons: one\nthat motivates\u2014the (putative) fact that Desdemona has been\nunfaithful; and one that explains\u2014the (actual) fact that Othello\nbelieves that she has. We can distinguish, then, between the reason\nthat explains Othello\u2019s action (the fact that he believes that\nDesdemona has been unfaithful) and the reason that motivates him to\nact (the alleged infidelity itself). It might be tempting to think\nthat Othello\u2019s motivating reason is just the fact that he\nbelieves that Desdemona has been unfaithful. We shall examine below\nreasons why the temptation should be resisted. Because of this, the\naccount that follows proceeds by dividing reasons for action initially\ninto two categories: normative and motivating-explanatory. It will\nthen present the case for treating motivating and explanatory reasons\nseparately.\n\nUntil relatively recently, the distinction between different kinds of\nreasons was assumed, whether explicitly or not, to imply that these\nreasons were things of different kinds. Normative reasons were\nconceived of as facts, and so were regarded as mind-independent: the facts\nare what they are independently of whether anyone knows them or thinks\nabout them. By contrast, motivating and explanatory reasons were\nconceived of as mental states of agents and, as such, as entities\nwhich depend on someone\u2019s thinking or believing certain things\n(Audi 2001 and Mele 2003 are representative examples\u2014but see\nalso Mele 2013). In recent years, however, this assumption has been\nchallenged, giving rise to a number of disputes about the ontology of\nreasons\u2014that is, disputes about what kind of thing or things\nreasons are. As we examine different kinds of reasons, we shall\nencounter some of these ontological debates. We start with normative\nreasons.\n",
