    "main_text": "Dual Transcendence in Whitehead and Hartshorne || Whitehead on the two natures of God\n4.1 Whitehead on the two natures of God\n\nIn Whitehead\u2019s philosophy, every actual entity has a physical\nand a mental pole. For this reason, Whitehead speaks of actual\nentities as \u201cdipolar\u201d (thus, a second meaning of the\nword). The physical and mental poles are aspects of every real being\n(actual entities) but they are not real beings themselves. In other\nwords, Whitehead is not a mind-body dualist. It is also important to\nnote that, for Whitehead, human consciousness is a higher form of\nmentality but not the only form. Thus, Whitehead does not claim that\nevery real being is a conscious entity. As with Leibniz, Whitehead\nrecognizes a continuum of mind-like qualities ranging from very\nprimitive feelings to the most advanced form of self-awareness.\nWhereas Leibniz speaks of every real being\u2014he calls them\nmonads\u2014as having apperception and appetition, Whitehead speaks\nof every actual entity as prehending, or grasping or taking\naccount of, its environment and as striving to realize the\nsubjective aim of coordinating its prehensions in some\ndeterminate fashion. In Process and Reality, Whitehead uses\nthe word \u201cfeeling\u201d as a synonym for prehension to indicate\nthe vector character of feelings\u2014a feeling is always a feeling\nof something. Whitehead\u2019s belief in a continuum of\nmental qualities fits neatly with evolutionary theory where it is\ncommonplace to conceive differing forms of organic complexity as\nassociated with differing levels of mental capacity. For example, the\nfrontal cortex of a human brain allows for more advanced mentality\nthan one finds in a chimpanzee, whose brain is not as complex.\n\nWhitehead is fully aware that there is an imaginative leap in applying\nthese categories to God, but he believes the application can be done\nin a disciplined and systematic fashion. Whitehead conceives God as an\nactual entity. In God, the physical and mental poles are called the\nconsequent nature and the primordial nature\nrespectively. As with the physical and mental poles of actual\nentities, so the two \u201cnatures\u201d are distinguishable but\ninseparable aspects of deity. That is to say, neither can exist apart\nfrom the other and each requires the other. The primordial nature is\nGod\u2019s envisagement of all possibilities; in the idiom of\nLeibniz, it is God\u2019s knowledge of all possible worlds. It is\ncalled \u201cprimordial\u201d because it represents what could\nbe in a sense not tethered to the actual course of events. It is\nlogical space, deficient in actuality apart from the consequent nature\nsays Whitehead. The consequent nature is God\u2019s prehensions of\nthe actual processes of the world. Conversely, it is the world\u2019s\ninfluence on God. It is called \u201cconsequent\u201d because it is\nconsequent upon, or dependent upon, the decisions of non-divine actual\nentities (Whitehead calls them actual occasions). The consequent\nnature is the record of all achieved fact, a perfect memory of what\nhas been\u2014Whitehead speaks of the \u201cobjective\nimmortality\u201d of the world in God. The two natures work in\nconcert in the process of God\u2019s interaction with the creatures.\nThe deity receives the world of actual occasions into its experience;\nthen, comparing what has actually occurred with the realm of pure\npossibility, God informs the world with new ideals (new aims),\ncustomized for each actual entity, for what realistically could be\nachieved. Whitehead sometimes refers to this aspect of the process as\nthe superjective nature of God. It is God\u2019s\nrelevance for the world as a \u201clure for feeling,\u201d urging\nthe creatures to strive for whatever perfection of which they are\ncapable.\n\nEach of the statements in Whitehead\u2019s \u201clitany\u201d can\nbe interpreted in terms of the interaction between the two natures and\nGod\u2019s interaction with the world. God is permanent in the sense\nof everlastingly envisioning the realm of possibility; the world is\npermanent as objectively immortal in God\u2019s memory. God is fluent\nin constantly acquiring new experiences of the world and the world is\nfluent in the rhythm of the birth and death of actual occasions. God\nis one in being a single actual entity; but God is many in the graded\nrelevance of possibilities provided for each emergent occasion. The\nworld is one in virtue of God\u2019s experience of it; the world is\nmany because of the plurality of occasions that make it up. God is\neminently actual in comparison to the world by achieving a unification\nof worldly occasions in the consequent nature that is beyond any of\nthem taken singly; but the world is eminently actual in comparison to\nGod\u2019s primordial nature, which is not concrete, although it is\nas infinite as the entire range of possibility. God and the world are\nimmanent in each other in that each experiences the other; yet God and\nthe world transcend each other by being realities whose experiences\nare not entirely determined by the other. Finally, as we have seen,\nGod creates the world by informing it with possibilities (technically\nspeaking, God provides \u201cinitial aims\u201d for every nascent\noccasion). The world creates God, not by bringing God into existence,\nbut by creating something in God, namely the material for what shall\nbecome objectively immortal.\n",
