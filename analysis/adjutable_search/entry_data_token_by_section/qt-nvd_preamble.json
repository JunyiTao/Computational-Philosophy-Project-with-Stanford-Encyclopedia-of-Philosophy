    "main_text": "\n\nAn ongoing debate in the foundations of quantum physics concerns the\nrole of mathematical rigor. The contrasting views of von Neumann and\nDirac provide interesting and informative insights concerning two\nsides of this debate. Von Neumann\u2019s contributions often\nemphasize mathematical rigor and Dirac\u2019s contributions emphasize\npragmatic concerns. The discussion below begins with an assessment of\ntheir contributions to the foundations of quantum mechanics. Their\ncontributions to mathematical physics beyond quantum mechanics are\nthen considered, and the focus will be on the influence that these\ncontributions had on subsequent developments in quantum theorizing,\nparticularly with regards to quantum field theory and its foundations.\nThe entry\n quantum field theory\n provides an overview of a variety of approaches to developing a\nquantum theory of fields. The purpose of this article is to provide a\nmore detailed discussion of mathematically rigorous approaches to\nquantum field theory, as opposed to conventional approaches, such as\nLagrangian quantum field theory, which are generally portrayed as\nbeing more heuristic in character. The current debate concerning\nwhether Lagrangian quantum field theory or axiomatic quantum field\ntheory should serve as the basis for interpretive analysis is then\ndiscussed.\n",
