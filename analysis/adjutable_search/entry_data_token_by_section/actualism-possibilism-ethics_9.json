That is, it generates multiple\nobligations such that it is impossible for the agent to fulfill all of\nthem. For example, Procrastinate is obligated to \u27e8decline to\nreview the paper\u27e9 because this would result in a better outcome\nthan the outcome that would follow \u27e8agreeing to review the\npaper\u27e9. On the other hand, Procrastinate is obligated to\n\u27e8agree to review the paper & write the review\u27e9\nbecause doing so would have a better outcome than the outcome of\n\u27e8declining to review the paper & not reviewing the\npaper\u27e9. This is a problem for Jackson and Pargetter\u2019s\nversion of actualism, to be discussed below. Goldman\u2019s and\nSobel\u2019s versions of actualism are formulated precisely to avoid\nthis problem.  To see how Goldman avoids this problem, consider the\nfollowing formulation of actualism that Goldman (1976: 471) considers\nand rejects:\n\n(G)S ought at\n\\(t_1\\), to perform \\(A_i\\) at \\(t_i\\) if and only if:\n\n\n(1)\nS has the\nability at \\(t_1\\) to perform \\(A_i\\), at \\(t_i\\), and\n(2)\n the sequence of acts\nfrom \\(t_i\\) which would follow \\(A_i\\) is better than any sequence\nfrom \\(t_i\\) which would follow any act that would be an alternative\nto \\(A_i\\) relative to \\(t_i\\).\n\n\n\n\nThe basic idea behind (G) is captured in the aforementioned rough\ndefinition of actualism. Here are the details. \u201c\\(A_i\\)\u201d\nmay apply to a single act or a sequence of acts over time. The main\nproblem that Goldman finds with (G) is that even if \\(A_i\\) satisfies\n(1) and (2), (G) does not take into account the following sort of\ncase: \u201c\\(A_i\\)\u201d refers to a sequence of acts over time,\nthe following counterfactual is true: \u201cif the agent were to\nperform the first half of \\(A_i\\), then the agent would not perform\nthe second half of \\(A_i\\)\u201d, and the sequence of acts that would\nfollow the performance of the first half of \\(A_i\\) would be worse\nthan the sequence of acts that would follow an alternative to the\nfirst half of \\(A_i\\). (G) implies that in this sort of case the agent\nhas jointly unfulfillable obligations at the same time t, viz.\nan obligation at t to perform \\(A_i\\) and an obligation at\nt to refrain from performing the first half of \\(A_i\\). For\nexample, according to (G) Procrastinate ought to \u27e8agree to\nreview the paper & write the review\u27e9 from\n\\(t_1\\)\u2013\\(t_2\\) because the sequence of acts that would follow\nthis act sequence from \\(t_2\\) is better than any sequence from\n\\(t_2\\) which would follow any alternative act sequence at\n\\(t_1\\)\u2013\\(t_2\\), including the alternative of \u27e8declining\nto review the paper & not writing the review\u27e9 from\n\\(t_1\\)\u2013\\(t_2\\). But, on the other hand, according to (G)\nProcrastinate ought to \u27e8decline to review the paper\u27e9 at\n\\(t_1\\) because the sequence of acts that would follow this from\n\\(t_1\\) is better than any sequence from \\(t_1\\) which would follow\nany alternative act at \\(t_1\\), including the alternative of\n\u27e8agreeing to review the paper\u27e9. Obviously, it cannot be\nthe case that both obligations are fulfilled.\n\nGoldman (1976: 467) illustrates the possibility of jointly\nunfulfillable obligations with the following example.\n\n Jones: Jones is deciding whether to go\nto the office or to stay home. She can \u27e8go to the office,\nattend the faculty meeting, and then vote for a language requirement\nfor undergraduates\u27e9. This is the best outcome available to\nJones over time. The worst outcome available to Jones is \u27e8going\nto the office, talking to a student, and then discouraging the student\nfrom seeking psychiatric aid\u27e9. The second-best outcome\navailable to Jones is \u27e8staying home, doing research for her\nlectures, and then writing the lecture notes\u27e9. The critical\ncounterfactual that partly shapes the relative values of Jones\u2019\noptions is this: \u201cif Jones were to \u27e8go to the\noffice\u27e9, then she would \u27e8talk to the student and then\nfreely discourage the student from seeking psychiatric\naid\u27e9\u201d.\n\n\nAlthough \u27e8going to the office\u27e9 is a prerequisite for the\nbest outcome (viz. the outcome that follows \u27e8voting for a\nlanguage requirement\u27e9), \u27e8going to the office\u27e9\nwould, in fact, result in the worst outcome (viz. the outcome that\nfollows \u27e8discouraging the student from seeking psychiatric\naid\u27e9). \u27e8Staying home\u27e9 rather than \u27e8going to\nthe office\u27e9 would result in a better outcome (viz. the outcome\nof \u27e8writing lecture notes\u27e9). Here is Goldman\u2019s\nchart, which summarizes Jones\u2019s predicament:\n\n\n\nFigure 1: [An\n extended description of figure 1\n is in the supplement.]\n\n\nAs a matter of stipulation, the act-set which would follow the act-set\nthat terminates with \u27e8voting for the language\nrequirement\u27e9 at \\(t_3\\) is better than the act-set which would\nfollow any other \\(t_1\\)\u2013\\(t_3\\) act-set available to Jones at\n\\(t_1\\). So\n (G)\n implies that, at \\(t_1\\), Jones ought to do the best she can.\nHowever, (G) also implies that, at \\(t_1\\), Jones ought to\n\u27e8stay home\u27e9 at \\(t_1\\) rather than \u27e8go to the\noffice\u27e9 at \\(t_1\\). This is because both acts are performable\nfor Jones at \\(t_1\\), and the act sequence which would follow\n\u27e8staying home\u27e9 is better than the act sequence which\nwould follow \u27e8going to the office\u27e9. So, according to\n(G), Jones has at least two obligations that are jointly\nunfulfillable, A: \u27e8going to the office, then going to\nthe faculty meeting, then voting for the language requirement\u27e9,\nand B: \u27e8staying home\u27e9. Jones cannot perform both\n\\(\\langle A \\lamp B\\rangle\\). There is no possible scenario in which\nboth obligations are fulfilled.\n",
