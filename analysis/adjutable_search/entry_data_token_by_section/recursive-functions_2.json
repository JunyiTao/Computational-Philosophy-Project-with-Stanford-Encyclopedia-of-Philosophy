    "main_text": "Historical Background || The Origins of Primitive Recursion\n1.2 The Origins of Primitive Recursion\n\nThe first work devoted exclusively to recursive definability was\nSkolem\u2019s (1923) paper \n\n\nThe foundations of elementary arithmetic established by the recursive\nmode of thought, without the use of apparent variables ranging over\ninfinite domains. \n\n\nThis work is significant with respect to the subsequent development of\ncomputability theory for at least three reasons. First, it contains a\ninformal description of what we now call the primitive recursive\nfunctions. Second, it can be regarded as the first place where\nrecursive definability is linked to effective computability (see also\nSkolem 1946). And third, it demonstrates that a wide range of\nfunctions and relations are primitive recursive in a manner which\nanticipates G\u00f6del\u2019s (1931) use of primitive recursion for\nthe arithmetization of syntax. \n\nOne of Skolem\u2019s stated goals was to present a logical foundation\nfor number theory which avoids the use of unrestricted quantifiers. He\nwas inspired in this regard by the observation that it is possible to\ndevelop much of elementary arithmetic without the use of the\nexpressions \u201calways\u201d (i.e. for all) and\n\u201csometimes\u201d (i.e. there exists) which figure in\nthe formalization of number theory given by Russell and Whitehead in\nPrincipia Mathematica (1910\u20131913). This was to be\naccomplished by formulating arithmetical theorems as what he referred\nto as functional assertions. These took the form of\nidentities between terms defined by primitive recursive operations\nwhich Skolem referred to as descriptive functions. For\ninstance, the commutativity of addition is expressed in this form by\nan equation with free variables  \n\\[\\begin{equation}\\label{funassert}\nx + y = y + x\n\\end{equation}\\]\n\n\nIn cases where such statements are provable in the system Skolem\ndescribes, the intended interpretation is that the claim holds\nuniversally for all natural numbers\u2014e.g., \\(\\forall x \\forall y\n(x + y = y + x)\\). But in Skolem\u2019s system there is no means of\nnegating such a statement to express a bare existential assertion\nwithout producing a witness.\n\nStatements like (\\ref{funassert}) would later be referred to by\nHilbert & Bernays (1934) (who provided the first textbook\ntreatment of recursion) as verifiable in the sense that their\nindividual instances can be verified computationally by replacing\nvariables with concrete numerals. This is accomplished by what Skolem\nreferred to as the \u201crecursive mode of thought\u201d. The sense\nof this phrase is clarified by the following properties of the system\nhe describes: \n\n the natural numbers are taken as basic objects\ntogether with the successor function \\(x + 1\\); \n it is assumed that descriptive functions proven to\nbe equal may be substituted for one another in other expressions;\n\n all definitions of functions and relations on\nnatural numbers are given by recursion; \nfunctional assertions such as (\\ref{funassert}) must\nbe proven by induction. \n\n\nTaking these principles as a foundation, Skolem showed how to obtain\nrecursive definitions of the predecessor and\nsubtraction functions, the less than,\ndivisibility, and primality relations, greatest\ncommon divisors, least common multiples, and bounded\nsums and products which are similar to those given in\n  Section 2.1.2 \n below.\n\nOverall Skolem considered instances of what we would now refer to as\nprimitive recursion, course of values recursion, double recursion, and\nrecursion on functions of type \\(\\mathbb{N} \\rightarrow \\mathbb{N}\\).\nHe did not, however, introduce general schemas so as to systematically\ndistinguish these modes of definition. Nonetheless, properties\ni\u2013iv of Skolem\u2019s treatment provide a means of assimilating\ncalculations like (\\ref{factcalc}) to derivations in quantifier-free\nfirst-order logic. It is thus not difficult to discern in (Skolem\n1923) the kernel of the system we now know as Primitive Recursive\nArithmetic (as later formally introduced by Hilbert & Bernays\n1934, ch. 7).\n\nThe next important steps in the development of a general theory of\nrecursive function arose as a consequence of the interaction between\n Hilbert\u2019s Program\n and G\u00f6del\u2019s (1931) proof of the Incompleteness Theorems.\nHilbert (1900) had announced the goal of proving the consistency of\narithmetic\u2014and ultimately also analysis and set theory\u2014 in\nthe face of the set theoretic paradoxes. His initial plans for\ncarrying out such a proof are described in a series of lectures and\naddresses in the 1910s\u20131920s which provide a description of what\nwould come to be called the finitary standpoint\u2014i.e.,\nthe fragment of mathematical reasoning pertaining to finite\ncombinatorial objects which was intended to serve as the secure basis\nfor a consistency proof. The proof itself was to be carried out using\nthe methods of what Hilbert referred to as\nmetamathematics\u2014i.e., the formal study of axioms and\nderivations which would grow into the subject now known as\n proof theory.\n\nIn one of his initial descriptions of this program Hilbert (1905)\nsketched the basic form which a metamathematical proof of consistency\nmight take. Suppose, for instance, that \\(\\mathsf{T}\\) is a\nmathematical theory about which it is possible to prove the following\nconditional:\n\nIf \\(n\\) applications of rules of inference applied to the axioms\nof a system \\(\\mathsf{T}\\) do not lead to a contradiction, then\n\\(n+1\\) applications also do not lead to a contradiction.\n\n\nWere it possible to provide a mathematical demonstration of i), it\nmight seem possible to conclude\n\n\\(\\mathsf{T}\\) is consistent.\n\n\nHowever Poincar\u00e9 (1906) observed that Hilbert\u2019s approach\nrelies on mathematical induction in inferring ii from i. He objected\non the basis that this renders Hilbert\u2019s proposed method\ncircular in the case that the system \\(\\mathsf{T}\\) in question itself\nsubsumes principles intended to formalize\n induction.[3]\n\n\nTogether with his collaborators Ackermann and Bernays, Hilbert\ndeveloped metamathematics considerably during the 1910\u20131920s.\nThis served as the basis of Hilbert\u2019s (1922) lecture wherein he\nreplied to Poincar\u00e9 by making a systematic distinction between\n\u201cformal\u201c occurrences of mathematical induction in the\nobject language and the metatheoretic use of induction as a\n\u201ccontentual\u201c [inhaltliche] principle used in\norder to reason about proofs as finite combinatorial objects. It was\nalso in this context in which Hilbert connected the latter form of\ninduction to the \u201cconstruction and deconstruction of number\nsigns\u201d (1922, 1123). \n\nAs is made clear in subsequent presentations, Hilbert understood\n\u201cnumber signs\u201d to be unary numerals written in stroke\nnotation of the form  \n\\[\\nonumber\n|, ||, |||, \\ldots\\]\n\n\nSuch expressions can be operated on concretely by adjoining or\nremoving strokes in a manner which mirrors the arithmetical operations\nof successor and predecessor which figure in Skolem\u2019s\n\u201crecursive mode of thought\u201c. This observation in turn\ninformed Hilbert\u2019s explanation of the meaning of functional\nassertions like (\\ref{funassert}) in terms of their logical\nderivability from recursive definitions which also serve as procedures\nfor computing the values of functions they define (Hilbert 1920,\n54\u201357).\n\nHilbert first described a logical calculus for finitary number theory\nincluding \u201crecursion and intuitive induction for finite\ntotalities\u201d in (1923,\n 1139).[4]\n Although this presentation also included a discussion of definition\nby simultaneous recursion, a more extensive treatment of what we would\nnow recognize as recursion schemes is given in his well known\npaper \u201cOn the infinite\u201d (1926). This includes a discussion\nof what Hilbert calls ordinary recursion (which is similar to\nSkolem\u2019s description of primitive recursion), transfinite\nrecursion, as well as recursion at higher types. This treatment makes\nclear that Hilbert and his collaborators had taken substantial steps\ntowards developing a general theory of recursive definability.\nUltimately, however, the influence of Hilbert\u2019s presentations\nwas diminished in light of the more precise formulation of primitive\nrecursion which G\u00f6del would soon\n provide.[5]\n\n\nG\u00f6del\u2019s (1931, 157\u2013159) definition was as\nfollows:\n\n\nA number-theoretic function \\(\\phi(x_1,\\ldots,x_n)\\) is said to be\nrecursively defined in terms of the number-theoretic\nfunctions \\(\\psi(x_1,x_2,\\ldots,x_{n-1})\\) and \\(\\mu(x_1,x_2,\\ldots,\nx_{n+1})\\) if \n\\[\\begin{align} \\label{gprimrec}\n\\text{i.}\\quad & \\phi(0,x_2,\\ldots,x_n)  =  \\psi(x_2,\\ldots,x_n) \\\\ \\nonumber\n\\text{ii.}\\quad & \\phi(k+1,x_2,\\ldots,x_n)  =  \\mu(k,\\phi(k,x_2,\\ldots,x_n),x_2,\\ldots,x_n)\n\\end{align}\\]\n\n\nholds for all \\(x_2,\\ldots,x_n,k\\).\n\nA number-theoretic function \\(\\phi\\) is said to be recursive\nif there is a finite sequence of number-theoretic functions \\(\\phi_1 ,\n\\phi_2 , \\ldots \\phi_n\\) that ends with \\(\\phi\\) and has the property\nthat every function \\(\\phi_k\\) of the sequence is recursively defined\nin terms of two of the preceding functions, or results from any of the\npreceding functions by substitution, or, finally, is a constant or the\nsuccessor function \\(x + 1\\)\u2026. A relation \\(R(x_1, \\ldots ,\nx_n)\\) between natural numbers is said to be recursive if\nthere is a recursive function \\(\\phi(x_1 \\ldots , x_n)\\) such that,\nfor all \\(x_1, x_2, \\ldots, x_n\\)  \n\\[\\begin{equation}\\label{prch}\nR(x_1,\\ldots,x_n) \\leftrightarrow \\phi(x_1,\\ldots,x_n) = 0\n\\end{equation}\\]\n\n\n\nPutting aside G\u00f6del\u2019s use of the term\n\u201crecursive\u201d rather than \u201cprimitive recursive\u201d\n(which will be explained below), this exposition comes close to\ncoinciding with the contemporary definition of the primitive recursive\nfunctions given in\n Section 2.1.[6]\n G\u00f6del\u2019s definition also improved upon those of his\npredecessors by clearly defining the class of initial functions which\nare allowed in primitive recursive definitions and by stating that\neach primitive recursive function possesses a definition in terms of a\nsequence of functions showing how it is built up from initial\nfunctions. This makes clear that the primitive recursive functions\nconstitute a mathematically well-defined class of functions on the\nnatural numbers (which will be denoted here as \\(\\mathbf{PR}\\)).\nG\u00f6del additionally proved that the primitive recursive\nrelations\u2014defined as characteristic functions via\n(\\ref{prch})\u2014are closed under propositional operations and\nquantification bounded by a primitive recursive function (see\n Section 2.1.2).\n",
