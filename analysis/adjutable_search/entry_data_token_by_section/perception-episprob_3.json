    "main_text": "Metaphysical Solutions to the Central Problem || Idealism and Phenomenalism\n2.2 Idealism and Phenomenalism\n\nIdealism and phenomenalism are views that hold that ordinary objects\n(tables, clouds, rocks, etc.) are really collections of or constructs\nout of actual and/or possible mental states, especially perceptual\nexperiences. (I won\u2019t try to distinguish phenomenalism from\nidealism but will use \u201cidealism\u201d to include both.) There\nare several varieties of idealism and several motivations for holding\nthe view. But one motivation is that it promises to solve the\nskeptical problem of the external world. Berkeley (1710) held that\nidealism was a cure for skepticism. Transcendental idealism (Kant\n1781) aims to split the difference with the skeptic by distinguishing\nthe phenomenal objects of perception\u2014which are collections of\nappearances and about which we can know something\u2014from the\nnoumenal objects\u2014which are things in themselves and not mere\nappearances, and about which skepticism is true.\n\nIdealism promises to solve the skeptical problem by attacking the\nIndirectness Principle. If the problem of the external world starts\nwith the gap between the proximal and the distal objects of perceptual\nexperience, then idealism would avoid skepticism by simply closing\nthat gap. The idealist can embrace direct world-involvement while\nretaining the claim that nothing is ever directly present to the mind\nbut its own mental states, by holding that the world is fundamentally\nmental, that, e.g., tables are just collections of ideas. Although\nmetaphysical solutions are usually aimed at the Indirectness\nPrinciple, idealism might, additionally, undermine the No-Good-Reason\nClaim. Hume (1739) argued that we couldn\u2019t reasonably posit\nexternal objects as plausible causes of our experiences without first\nobserving a constant conjunction between external objects and\nexperiences; but we can\u2019t \u201cobserve\u201d external objects\nunless we justifiedly believe in their existence, which we could only\ndo if we could reasonably posit them as plausible causes of our\nexperiences. Thus, a vicious circularity. On the other hand, if the\nobjects of perception are not external after all, we are in a better\nposition to infer causal relations between them and individual\nexperiences.\n\nThe main difference between idealism and an indirect realism concerns\nnot so much the metaphysics of perception as a larger metaphysical\nview about what else exists outside of the mind. Berkeley and\nDescartes agree about the direct objects of perception, but Descartes\nposits an additional stratum of mind-independent external objects in\naddition. The idealist denies that there is a veil of perception not\nbecause Descartes was wrong about the nature of perception, but\nbecause he was wrong about the natures of cats and rocks.\n\nIdealism has a few contemporary defenders (e.g., Foster 2008, Hoffman\n2009, Robinson 2022), though it is nowhere near the dominant view that\nit had been for almost two centuries after Berkeley. Most responses to\nPEW in the last century have endorsed some kind of realism instead,\ninsisting that ordinary objects are indeed mind-independent.\n",
