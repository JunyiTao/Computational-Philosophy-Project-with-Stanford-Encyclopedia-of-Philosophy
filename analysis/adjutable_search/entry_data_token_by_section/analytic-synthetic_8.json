    "main_text": "Problems with the Distinction || Convention?\n3.3 Convention?\n\nConvention, indeed, would seem to be at the very heart of the\nanalytic. After all, aren\u2019t matters of meaning, unlike matters\nof fact, in the end really matters of arbitrary conventions about the\nuse of words? For example, someone could invest a particular word,\nsay, \u201cschmuncle,\u201d with a specific meaning merely by\nstipulating that it mean, say, unmarried uncle. Wouldn\u2019t that\nafford a basis for claiming then that \u201cA schmuncle is an\nuncle\u201d is analytic, or knowable to be true by virtue of the\n(stipulated) meanings of the words alone?\n\nCarnap (1956a) proposed setting out the \u201cmeaning\npostulates\u201d of a scientific language as just such conventional\nstipulations. This had the further advantage of allowing terms to be\n\u201cimplicitly defined\u201d by their conventional roles in such\npostulates, which might then serve as part of a theory\u2019s laws or\naxioms. The strategy seemed especially appropriate for defining\nlogical constants, as well as for dealing with cases like (11)-(13)\nabove, e.g. \u201cRed is a color,\u201d where mere substitution of\nsynonyms might not\n suffice.[9]\n So perhaps what philosophical analysis is doing is revealing the\ntacit conventions of ordinary language, an approach particularly\nfavored by Ayer (1934/52).\n\nQuine is sceptical such a strategy could work for the principles of\nlogic itself. Drawing on his earlier discussion (1936 [1976]) of the\nconventionality of logic, he argues that logic itself could not be\nentirely established by such conventions, since:\n\n\nthe logical truths, being infinite in number, must be given by general\nconventions rather than singly; and logic is needed then in the\nmeta-theory, in order to apply the general conventions to individual\ncases (CLT, p. 115)\n\n\nIf so, and if logic is established by convention, then one would need\na meta-meta-theory to establish the conventions for the use\nof the logical particles of the meta-theory, and so on for what seemed\nlike an infinite regress of meta-theories. This is certainly an\nargument that ought to give the proponents of the conventionality of\nlogic pause: for, indeed, how could one hope to set out the general\nconventions for \u201call\u201d or\n\u201cif\u2026then\u2026\u201d without at some point using the\nnotions of \u201call\u201d and \u201cif\u2026then\u2026\u201d\n(\u201cALL instances of a universal quantification are to be\ntrue\u201d. \u201cIF p is one premise, and if p then\nq another, THEN conclude q\u201d)? (See Warren, 2017,\nhowever, for a reply, exploiting the resources of implicit definition;\ncf. fns 9 and 16.)\n\nAs we noted, Quine sees more room for convention in choosing between\ndifferent, incompatible versions of set theory needed for mathematics\nthat were developed in the wake of Russell\u2019s paradox. Here:\n\n\nWe find ourselves making deliberate choices and setting them forth\nunaccompanied by any attempt at justification other than in terms of\nelegance and convenience. (CLT, p. 117).\n\n\nBut then it\u2019s hard to see the difference between mathematics and\nthe conventional \u201cmeaning postulates\u201d Carnap had proposed\nfor establishing the rest of science \u2014and then the difference\nbetween them and any other claims of a theory. As Quine goes on to\nargue, although stipulative definitions (what he calls\n\u201clegislative postulations\u201d)\n\n\ncontribute truths which become integral to the corpus of truths, the\nartificiality of their origin does not linger as a localized quality,\nbut suffuses the corpus. If a subsequent expositor singles out those\nonce legislatively postulated truths again as postulates, this\nsignifies nothing\u2026 He could as well choose his postulates from\nelsewhere in the corpus, and will if he thinks it this serves his\nexpository ends. (CLT, pp. 119\u201320)\n\n\nCarnap\u2019s legislated \u201cmeaning postulates\u201d should\ntherefore be regarded as just an arbitrary selection of sentences a\ntheory presents as true, a selection perhaps useful for purposes of\nexposition, but no more significant than the selection of certain\ntowns in Ohio as \u201cstarting points\u201d for a journey Quine\n(1953 [1980a], p. 35).\n\nQuine\u2019s observation certainly seems to accord with scientific\npractice. Suppose, say, Newton, himself, had explicitly set out\n\u201cF=ma\u201d as a stipulated definition of \u201cF\u201d:\nwould \u201cF=ma\u201d be therefore justifiable by knowing the\nmeaning the words alone? Our taking such a stipulation seriously would\nseem to depend upon our view of the plausibility of the surrounding\ntheory as a whole. After all, as Quine continues:\n\n\n[S]urely the justification of any theoretical hypothesis can, at the\ntime of hypothesis, consist in no more than the elegance and\nconvenience which the hypothesis brings to the containing bodies of\nlaws and data. How then are we to delimit the category of legislative\npostulation, short of including under it every new act of scientific\nhypothesis? (CLT, p. 121)\n\n\nSo conventional legislation of claims, such as Carnap\u2019s meaning\npostulates, affords the claims no special status. As vivid examples,\nPutnam (1965 [1975]) discusses in detail revisions of the definitions\nof \u201cstraight line\u201d and \u201ckinetic energy\u201d in the\nlight of Einstein\u2019s theories of\n relativity.[10]\n\nThis appeal to \u201cthe containing bodies of laws and data\u201d\nessentially invokes Quine\u2019s famous holistic metaphor of the\n\u201cweb of belief\u201d with which CLT eloquently concludes:\n\n\nthe lore of our fathers is a fabric of sentences [which] develops and\nchanges, through more or less arbitrary and deliberate revisions and\nadditions of our own, more or less directly occasioned by the\ncontinuing stimulation of our sense organs. It is a pale grey lore,\nblack with fact and white with convention. But I have found no\nsubstantial reasons for concluding that there are any quite black\nthreads in it, or any white ones (CLT, p.\n 132)[11]\n\n3.4 Verification and Confirmation Holism\n\nThe picture presented in this last and many similar passages expresses\na tremendously influential view of Quine\u2019s that led several\ngenerations of philosophers to despair not only of the\nanalytic-synthetic distinction, but of the category of a\npriori knowledge entirely. The view has come to be called\n\u201cconfirmation holism,\u201d and Quine had expressed it more\nshortly a few years earlier, in his widely read article, \u201cTwo\nDogmas of Empiricism\u201d (1953 [1980a]):\n\n\nOur statements about the external world face the tribunal of sense\nexperience not individually, but only as a corporate body. (1953\n[1980a], p. 41)\n\n\nIndeed, the \u201ctwo dogmas\u201d that the article discusses are\n(i) the belief in the intelligibility of the \u201canalytic\u201d\nitself, and (ii), what Quine regards as the flip side of the same\ncoin, the belief that \u201ceach statement, taken in isolation from\nits fellows, can admit of confirmation or infirmation at all\u201d\n(p. 41), i.e., the very version of the Verifiability Theory of Meaning\nwe have seen the Positivists enlisted in their effort to\n\u201canalyze\u201d the claims of science and\n commonsense.[12]\n\nQuine bases his \u201cconfirmation holism\u201d upon observations of\nPierre Duhem (1914 [1954]), who drew attention to the myriad ways in\nwhich theories are supported by evidence, and the fact that an\nhypothesis is not (dis)confirmed merely by some specific experiment\nconsidered in isolation from an immense amount of surrounding theory.\nThus, a thermometer will be a good indication of ambient temperature\nonly if it\u2019s made of the right materials, calibrated\nappropriately, and there aren\u2019t any other forces at work that\nmight disturb the measurement\u2014and, of course, only if the\nbackground laws of physics and other beliefs that have informed the\ndesign of the measurement are sufficiently correct. A failure of the\nthermometer to measure the temperature could be due to a failure of\nany of these other conditions, which is, of course, why experimenters\nspend so much time and money constructing experiments to\n\u201ccontrol\u201d for them. Moreover, with a small change in our\ntheories or background beliefs, or just in our understanding of the\nconditions for measurement, we might change the tests on which we\nrely, but often without changing the meaning of the sentences whose\ntruth we might be trying to establish (which, as Putnam 1965 [1975]\npointed out, is precisely what practicing scientists regularly\ndo).\n\nWhat is novel\u2014and highly controversial\u2014about Quine\u2019s\nunderstanding of these commonplace observations is his extension of\nthem to claims presumed by most people (e.g., by Duhem himself) to lie\noutside their scope, viz., the whole of mathematics and even logic! It\nis this extension that seems to undermine the traditional a\npriori status of these latter domains, since it appears to open\nthe possibility of a revision of logic, mathematics and any supposed\nanalytic claims in the interest of the plausibility of the one,\noverall resulting empirical theory\u2014containing the empirical\nclaims and those of logic, mathematics and the analytic!\nPerhaps this wouldn\u2019t be so odd should the revisability of such\nclaims permit their ultimately admitting of a justification that\ndidn\u2019t involve experience. But this is ruled out by\nQuine\u2019s insistence that scientific theories, along with their\nlogic and mathematics, are confirmed \u201conly\u201d as\n\u201ccorporate\n bodies.\u201d[13]\n\nOne might wonder why, though, there have historically been virtually\nno revisions of mathematics on empirical grounds. A common example\noffered is how Riemannian replaced Euclidean geometry in\nEinstein\u2019s theory of General Relativity. But this mis-interprets\nthe history. Non-Euclidean geometries were purely conceptual\ndevelopments in the 19th C. by mathematicians such as Gauss, Riemann\nand Lobechevsky. Einstein simply argued in 1916 that one of these\nconceptual possibilities seemed to be better supported by physics than\nwas the traditional Euclidean one, and should therefore be taken to be\ntrue of actual space(-time). It is only this latter claim that is\nempirical.\n\nCertainly, though, Quine\u2019s holism has been an epistemic\npossibility that many have taken seriously. For example, influenced by\nQuine\u2019s claim, Putnam (1968 [1975]) argued that one ought to\nrevise even elementary logic in view of the surprising results of\nquantum mechanics (a proposal not without its critics, see Quantum\nLogic and Probability Theory). And in his (1962 [1975] he also\nargued that it isn\u2019t hard to imagine discovering that a\npurported analytic truth, such as Cats are animals, could be\ngiven up in light of discovering that the little things are really\ncleverly disguised robots controlled from Mars (but see Katz, 1990,\npp. 216ff and G. Russell, 2008, for replies, and the\nsupplement \u00a73 for further discussion).\n3.5 Quine on Meaning in Linguistics \n\nQuine\u2019s discussion of the role of convention in science seems\nright; but how about the role of meaning in ordinary natural language\n(cf. Chomsky\u2019s 2000 cautions mentioned in\n footnote 10)?\n Is it really true that in the \u201cpale grey lore\u201d of all the\nsentences we accept, there aren\u2019t some that are\n\u201cwhite\u201d somehow \u201cby virtue of the very meanings of\ntheir words\u201d? What about our examples in our earlier set II?\nWhat about sentences of the sort that interest Juhl and Loomis (2010)\nthat merely link patent synonyms, as in \u201cLawyers are\nattorneys,\u201d or \u201cA fortnight is a period of fourteen\ndays\u201d? As Grice and Strawson (1956) and Putnam (1965 [1975])\npointed out, it is unlikely that so intuitively plausible a\ndistinction should turn out to have no basis at all in\nfact.\n\nQuine addressed this issue, first, in his (1953 [1980a], chapter 3),\nand then in a much larger way in his (1960, chapter 2, and 1974) and\nrelated articles. In his (1953 [1980a]) he pressed his objection to\nanalyticity further to the very ideas of synonymy and the linguistic\nmeaning of an expression, on which, we saw, Frege\u2019s criterion of\nanalyticity crucially relied. His objection is that he sees no way to\nmake any serious explanatory sense of them. He explored plausible\nexplanations in terms of \u201cdefinition,\u201d\n\u201cintension,\u201d \u201cpossibility,\u201d and\n\u201ccontradiction,\u201d, pointing out that each of these notions\nseems to stand in precisely as much need of explanation as synonymy\nitself (recall our observation in \u00a71.2 above regarding the lack\nof any formal contradiction in \u201cSome pediatricans\naren\u2019t doctors\u201d). The terms seem to be mutually definable\nin what seems to be a\u2014viciously?\u2014small \u201cclosed curve\nin space\u201d (Quine 1953 [1980a], p. 30). Though they might be\ninvoked to explain one another, they could not in the end answer the\nchallenge of how to distinguish an analytic claim from simply a\ntenaciously held belief.\n\nTo take a recent example, David Chalmers (2012) revisits\nCarnap\u2019s (1956b) proposal for basing synonymy on\n\u201cintension\u201d by way of eliciting a person\u2019s judgments\nabout the extension of a term/concept in all possible\n worlds:[14]\n\n\nCarnap\u2019s key idea is that we can investigate the intension that\na subject associated with an expression by investigating the\nsubject\u2019s judgments about possible cases. To determine the\nintension of an expression such as \u2018Pferd\u2019 for a subject,\nwe present the subject with descriptions of various logically possible\ncases, and we ask the subject whether he or she is willing to apply\nthe term \u2018Pferd\u2019 to objects specified in these cases. If\nwe do this for enough cases, then we can test all sorts of hypotheses\nabout the intension of the expression. (Chalmers 2012, p. 204)\n\n\nBut how are the informants to understand the questions they\u2019re\nbeing asked? If they understand the term \u201cpossible\u201d as\nlogicians do, as truth in a set-theoretically specified\nmodel, then it will be too weak: there are obviously models in\nwhich synonymous expressions e.g., \u201chorse\u201d and\n\u201cPferd,\u201d or \u201cbachelor\u201d and \u201cunmarried\nmale\u201d are assigned non-overlapping sets (cf. Quine\n[1953 [1980a], pp. 22\u20133), so that it\u2019s logically possible\nfor there be a horse that\u2019s not a Pferd, or a bachelor\nthat\u2019s married (again, \u201ca married bachelor\u201d is\nformally contradictory only if one substitutes synonyms for synonyms;\nbut we certainly can\u2019t appeal to synonymy in trying to\ndefine synonymy). But if \u201cpossible\u201d is understood\n(as it ordinarily would be) as merely imaginable, then it\nwill be far too strong, ruling out ideas that the scientifically\nunder-informed might find impossible, e.g., curved space-time,\nsomething having the properties of both waves and particles, or\ncompletely unconscious thoughts (which, at least, e.g., John Searle\n1992, pp. 155\u20136, and Galen Strawson 1994, pp. 166\u20137 report\nhaving trouble conceiving). As Quine (1953 [1980a]) famously argued,\nsuch appeals to informant verdicts will only work if the informants\nunderstand the questions as about the very terms the proposed test\nis supposed to define, viz., \u201cpossible\u201d as\nconstrained by synonymy or preservation of meaning. Although, as many\nhave noted (e.g., Williamson 2007, p. 50), there may be explanatory\ncircularities in the best of theories, the circularity here seems\nparticularly vicious, with the relevant ideas appearing not to perform\nany explanatory work other than bringing in each other\u2019s\nlaundry.\n\nWhy was Quine so convinced of this last claim? Because he thought it\nwas possible to provide a satisfactory explanation of human language\nwithout them, indeed, without any mentalistic notions at all. In his\n(1953 [1980b], 1960 [2013] and 1974) he sketched a behavioristic\ntheory of language that doesn\u2019t rely on the postulation of\ndeterminate meaning or reference, and argued that, indeed, translation\nis \u201cindeterminate\u201d: there is \u201cno fact of the\nmatter\u201d about whether two expressions do or do not have the same\nmeaning (see Indeterminacy of Translation). This would appear\nto imply that there are pretty much no facts of the matter about\npeople\u2019s mental lives at all! For, if there is no fact of the\nmatter about whether two people mean the same thing by their words,\nthen there is no fact of the matter about the content of\nanyone\u2019s thoughts. Quine himself took this consequence in\nstride\u2014he was, after all, a behaviorist\u2013 regarding it as\n\u201cof a piece\u201d with Franz Brentano\u2019s (1874 [1995])\nfamous thesis of the \u201cirreducibility of the intentional\u201d;\nit\u2019s just that for him, unlike for Brentano, it simply showed\nthe \u201cbaselessness of intentional idioms and the emptiness of a\nscience of intention\u201d (1960 [2013], p. 202). Needless to say,\nmany subsequent philosophers have not been happy with this view, and\nhave wondered where Quine\u2019s argument went wrong.\n3.6 Explaining Away the Appearance of the Analytic\n\nOne problem many have had with Quine\u2019s argument is about how to\nexplain the appearance of the analytic. It just seems an\nempirical fact that most people would spontaneously distinguish our\noriginal two sets of sentences (\u00a71) by saying that sentences of\nthe second set, such as \u201cAll pediatricians are doctors for\nchildren\u201d are \u201ctrue by definition,\u201d or could be\nknown to be true just by knowing the meanings of the constituent\nwords. Moreover, they might agree about an indefinite number of\nfurther examples, e.g., that ophthalmologists are eye doctors,\ngrandfathers are parents of parents, sauntering a kind of movement,\npain and beliefs mental states, and promising an intentional act.\nAgain, as Grice and Strawson (1956) and Putnam (1965 [1975]) stressed,\nit\u2019s implausible to suppose that there\u2019s nothing\npeople are getting at in these judgments.\n3.6.1 Centrality\n\nQuine\u2019s (1953 [1980a]) initial explanation of the appearance of\nthe analytic invoked his metaphor of the web of belief, claiming that\nsentences are more or less revisable, depending upon how\n\u201cperipheral\u201d or \u201ccentral\u201d their position is in\nthe web, the more peripheral ones being closer to experience. The\nappearance of sentences being \u201canalytic\u201d is simply due to\ntheir being, like the laws of logic and mathematics, comparatively\ncentral, and so are given up, if ever, only under extreme pressure\nfrom the peripheral forces of experience. But no sentence is\nabsolutely immune from revision; all sentences are thereby empirical,\nand none is actually analytic.\n\nThere are a number of problems with this explanation. In the first\nplace, centrality and the appearance of analyticity don\u2019t seem\nto be so closely related. As Quine (1960, p. 66) himself noted, there\nare are plenty of central, unrevisable beliefs that don\u2019t seem\nremotely analytic, e.g., \u201cThere have been black dogs,\u201d\n\u201cThe earth has existed for more than five minutes,\u201d\n\u201cMass-energy is conserved\u201d; and many standard examples of\nwhat seem analytic aren\u2019t seriously central: \u201cBachelors\nare unmarried,\u201d \u201cA fortnight is two weeks\u201d or\n\u201cA beard is facial hair\u201d are pretty trivial verbal issues,\nand could easily be revised if people really cared (cf., Juhl and\nLoomis, 2010, p. 118).\n\nSecondly, it\u2019s not mere unrevisability that seems distinctive of\nthe analytic, but rather a certain sort of unintelligibility:\nfor all the unrevisability of \u201cThere have been black\ndogs,\u201d it\u2019s perfectly possible to imagine it to\nbe false. In contrast, what\u2019s peculiar about analytic claims is\nthat their denials often seem peculiarly impossible to seriously\nthink: it seems distinctively impossible to imagine a married\nbachelor. Now, of course, as we noted, this could be due simply to a\nfailure of imagination. But what\u2019s striking about about the\nunrevisability of many apparently analytic cases is that they\ndon\u2019t appear to be like scientifically controversial cases such\nas curved space-time or completely unconscious thoughts. The standard\ncases about, e.g., bachelors or pediatricians seem entirely innocuous.\nFar from unrevisability explaining analyticity, it would seem to\nbe analyticity that explains this peculiar unrevisability: the\nonly reason someone might balk at denying bachelors are unmarried is\nthat, well, that\u2019s just what the word \u201cbachelor\u201d\n means![15]\n The challenge, though, is to clarify the basis for this sort of\nexplanation.\n\nIt is important to note here a crucial change that Quine (and earlier\nPositivists) casually introduced into the characterization of the\na priori, and consequently into much of the now common\nunderstanding of the analytic. Where Kant and others had traditionally\nassumed that the a priori concerned beliefs\n\u201cjustifiable independently of experience,\u201d Quine and many\nother philosophers of the time came to regard it as consisting of\nbeliefs \u201cunrevisable in the light of experience.\u201d And, as\nwe have seen, a similar status is accorded the at least apparently\nanalytic. However, this would imply that people taking something to be\nanalytic or a priori would have to regard themselves as being\ninfallible about it, forever unwilling to revise it in light\nof further evidence or argument. But this is a further claim that many\ndefenders of the traditional notions need not embrace (consider,\nagain, the disputes philosophers have about the proper analysis of\nterms such as \u201cknowledge\u201d or \u201cfreedom\u201d).\n\nIndeed, a claim might be in fact analytic and justifiable\nindependently of experience, but nevertheless perfectly well revised\nin the light of it. Experience, after all, might mislead us, as it\n(perhaps) misled Putnam when he suggested revising logic in light of\ndifficulties in quantum mechanics, or suggested revising \u201ccats\nare animals,\u201d were we to discover the things were robots. Just\nwhich claims are genuinely analytic and a priori might not be\navailable in the \u201carmchair\u201d at the introspective or\nbehavioral surface of our lives in the way that Quine and much of the\nphilosophical tradition has assumed. Certainly the \u201cdispositions\nto assent or dissent from sentences\u201d on which Quine (1960\n[2013], chapter 2) standardly relied are likely very dubious guides\n(see the findings of \u201cexperimental philosophy\u201d discussed\nin \u00a74.1 below). Behavioral dispositions in general may have any\nof a variety of aetiologies that aren\u2019t clearly distinguishable\nin actual behavior (one wonders how much of Quine\u2019s seamless\nepistemology went hand in hand with his mentalistically seamless\nbehavioristic psychology). The relevant dispositions might be hidden\nmore deeply in our minds, and our access to them as fallible as our\naccess to any other such facts about ourselves. The genuinely analytic\nmay be a matter of difficult reflective analysis or deep linguistic\ntheory (see Bealer, 1987, Bonjour 1998, Rey, 1998, and\nsupplement), a possibility to which we will return\nshortly.\n3.6.2 One Criterion Concepts\n\nIn his expansion of Quine\u2019s point, Putnam (1962 [1975]) tried to\nrescue what he thought were theoretically innocuous examples of\nanalytic truths by appeal to what he called\n\u201cone-criterion\u201d concepts, or concepts like, e.g.,\npediatrician, bachelor, widow, where there seems to be only\none \u201cway to tell\u201d whether they apply. However, as Fodor\n(1998) pointed out, so stated, this latter account won\u2019t suffice\neither, since the notion of \u201ccriterion\u201d seems no better\noff than \u201cmeaning\u201d or \u201canalytic.\u201d Moreover, if\nthere were one way to tell what\u2019s what, there would seem,\ntrivially, to be indefinite numbers of other ways: look for some\nreliable correlate (living alone, frequenting singles bars for\n\u201cbachelor\u201d), or, just ask someone who knows the one way;\nor ask someone who knows someone who knows; or\u2026, etc., and so\nnow we would be faced with saying which of these ways is genuinely\n\u201ccriterial,\u201d which would seem to leave us with the same\nproblem we faced in saying which way appears to be\n\u201canalytic.\u201d\n\nFodor (1998) tried to improve on Putnam\u2019s proposal by suggesting\nthat a criterion that appears to be analytic is the one on which all\nthe other criteria depend, but which does not depend upon them. Thus,\ntelling that someone is a bachelor by checking out his gender and\nmarriage status doesn\u2019t depend upon telling by asking his\nfriends, but telling by asking his friends does depend upon telling by\nhis gender and marriage status; and so we have an explanation of why\n\u201cbachelors are unmarried males\u201d seems analytic, but, said\nFodor, without it\u2019s actually being so (perhaps somewhat\nsurprisingly, given his general \u201casymmetric dependence\u201d\ntheory of content, see his 1990b and Rey, 2009, to be discussed\nshortly, \u00a7\u00a74.2\u20134.3).\n\nHowever, such asymmetric dependencies among criteria alone will not\n\u201cexplain (away)\u201d either the reality or the appearance of\nthe analytic, since there would appear to be asymmetric dependencies\nof the proposed sort in non-analytic cases. Natural kinds are dramatic\ncases in point (see Putnam 1962 [1975], 1970 [1975], 1975). At some\nstage in history probably the only way anyone could tell whether\nsomething was a case of polio was to see whether there was a certain\nconstellation of standard symptoms, e.g. paralysis; other ways\n(including asking others) asymmetrically depended upon that way. But\nthis wouldn\u2019t make \u201cAll polio cases exhibit\nparalysis\u201d remotely analytic\u2014after all, the standard\nsymptoms for many diseases can sometimes be quite misleading. It\nrequired serious empirical research to discover the proper definition\nof a natural kind term like \u201cpolio.\u201d Precisely as Putnam\notherwise stressed, methods of testing are so variable it is doubtful\nthat even \u201csingle criterion\u201d tests could provide a basis\nfor the identification of the stable meanings of words.\n\nIndeed, as many philosophers in the wake of Quine\u2019s and\nPutnam\u2019s work came to suspect, the recourse of philosophy in\ngeneral to epistemology to ground semantics may have been a\nfundamental mistake. It was an enticing recourse: it seemed to offer a\nway to dispatch philosophical disputes and secure empirical knowledge\nfrom sceptical challenges regarding demons and dreams. But the above\ndifficulties suggested that those disputes and challenges would need\nto be met in some other way, perhaps by looking not to words, but to\nthe world instead.\n3.6.3 The World, not Words\n\nIndeed, another strategy that a Quinean can deploy to explain the\nappearance of the analytic is to claim that analyses are really not of\nthe meanings of words, but of the actual phenomena in the\nworld to which they refer (see Fodor, 1990b, 1998). Thus, claims\nthat, e.g., cats are animals, triangles are three-sided, or that every\nnumber has a successor should not be construed as claims about the\nmeanings of the words \u201ccat\u201d, \u201ctriangle\u201d or\n\u201cnumber,\u201d but about the nature of cats,\ntriangles and numbers themselves. Arguably, many such\nclaims, if they are true, are necessarily so (cf., Kripke,\n1972; Putnam, 1975), and may be commonly understood to be, and this\nmight make them seem analytic. But then we would be faced with\nprecisely the challenge that Quine raised: how to distinguish claims\nof analyticity from simply deeply held beliefs about \u201cthe\nnature\u201d of things.\n\nThis recourse to the world may, however, be a little too swift. Cases\nof (arguably) deeply explanatory natural kinds such as polio\nor cats contrast dramatically with cases of more superficial\nkinds like bachelor or fortnight. whose natures are\nnot specified by any explanatory science, but are pretty much\nexhausted by what would seem to be the meanings of the words. Again,\nunlike the case of polio and its symptoms, the reason that gender and\nmarriage status are the best way to tell whether someone is a bachelor\nis, again, that that\u2019s just what \u201cbachelor\u201d means.\nIndeed, should a doctor propose revising the test for polio in the\nlight of better theory\u2014perhaps reversing the dependency of\ncertain tests\u2014this would not even begin to appear to involve a\nchange in the meaning of the term. Should, however, a feminist\npropose, in the light of better politics, revising the use of\n\u201cbachelor\u201d to include women, this obviously would. If the\nappearance of the analytic is to be explained away, it needs to\naccount for such differences in our understanding of different sorts\nof revisions in our beliefs, which don\u2019t appear to be\nissues regarding the external world.\n4. Post-Quinean Strategies\n\nThere has been a wide variety of responses to Quine\u2019s\nchallenges. Some, for example, Davidson (1980), Stich (1983) and\nDennett (1987), seem simply to accept it and try to account for our\npractice of meaning ascription within its \u201cnon-factual\u201d\nbounds. Since they follow Quine in at least claiming to forswear the\nanalytic, we will not consider their views further here. Others, who\nmight be (loosely) called \u201cneo-Cartesians,\u201d reject\nQuine\u2019s attack as simply so much prejudice of the empiricism and\nnaturalism that they take to be his own uncritical dogmas (\u00a74.1\nin what follows). Still others hope simply to find a way to break out\nof the \u201cintentional circle,\u201d and provide an account of at\nleast what it means for one thing (a state of the brain, for example)\nto mean (or \u201ccarry the information about\u201d) another\nexternal phenomenon in the world (\u00a74.2). Perhaps the most\ntrenchant reaction has been that of empirically oriented linguists and\nphilosophers, who look to a specific explanatory role the analytic may\nplay in an account of thought and talk (\u00a74.3). This role is\ncurrently being explored in considerable detail in the now various\nareas of research inspired by the important linguistic theories of\nNoam Chomsky (\u00a74.4, and supplement, Analyticity and Chomskyan\nLinguistics).\n4.1 Neo-Cartesianism\n\nThe most unsympathetic response to Quine\u2019s challenges has been\nessentially to stare him down and insist upon an inner faculty of\n\u201cintuition\u201d whereby the truth of certain claims is simply\n\u201cgrasped\u201d directly through, as Bonjour (1998) puts it:\n\n\nan act of rational insight or rational intuition \u2026 [that] is\nseemingly (a) direct or immediate, nondiscursive, and yet also (b)\nintellectual or reason-governed \u2026 [It] depends upon nothing\nbeyond an understanding of the propositional content itself\u2026.\n(p. 102)\n\n\nBealer (1987, 1999) defends similar proposals. Neither Bonjour nor\nBealer are in fact particularly concerned to defend the analytic by\nsuch claims, but their recourse to mere understanding of propositional\ncontent is certainly what many defenders of the analytic have had in\nmind. Katz (1998, pp. 44\u20135), for example, explicitly made the\nvery same appeal to intuitions on behalf of the analytic claims\nsupported by his semantic theory. Somewhat more modestly, Peacocke\n(1992, 2004) claims that possession of certain logical concepts\nrequires that a person find certain inferences \u201cprimitively\ncompelling,\u201d or compelling not by reason of some inference that\ntakes \u201ctheir correctness\u2026as answerable to anything\nelse\u201d (1992, p. 6; see also his 2004, p. 100 and the other\nreferences in fn 9 above for the strategy, and fn 7, as well as\nHarman, 1996 [1999], and Horwich, 2000, for qualms).\n\nPerhaps the simplest reply along these lines emerges from a suggestion\nof David Lewis (1972 [1980]), who proposes to implicitly define, e.g.,\npsychological terms by conjoining the \u201cplatitudes\u201d in\nwhich they appear:\n\n\nInclude only platitudes that are common knowledge among us \u2013\neveryone knows them, everyone knows that everyone else knows them, and\nso on. For the meanings of our words are common knowledge, and I am\ngoing to claim that names of mental states derive their meaning from\nthese platitudes. (1972 [1980], p. 212)\n\n\nEnlarging on this idea, Frank Jackson (1998) emphasizes the role of\nintuitions about possible cases, as well as the need sometimes to\nmassage such intuitions so as to arrive at \u201cthe hypothesis that\nbest makes sense of [folk] responses\u201d (p. 36; see also pp.\n 34\u20135).[16]\n\nThe Quinean reply to all these approaches is, again, his main\nchallenge: how in the end are we to distinguish such claims of\n\u201crational insight,\u201d \u201cprimitive compulsion,\u201d\ninferential practices or folk beliefs, from merely some deeply\nentrenched empirical convictions, folk practices or, indeed, from mere\ndogmas? Isn\u2019t the history of thought littered with what have\nturned out to be deeply mistaken claims, inferences and platitudes\nthat people at the time have found \u201crationally\u201d and/or\n\u201cprimitively compelling,\u201d say, with regard to God, sin,\ndisease, biology, sexuality, or even patterns of reasoning themselves?\nAgain, consider the resistance Kahneman (2011) reports people\ndisplaying to correction of the fallacies they commit in a surprising\nrange of ordinary thought (cf. fn 7 above); or in a more disturbing\nvein, how the gifted mathematician, John Nash, claimed that his\ndelusional ideas \u201cabout supernatural beings came to me the same\nway that my mathematical ideas did\u201d (Nasar 1998, p. 11).\nIntrospected episodes, primitive compulsions, intuitions about\npossibilities, or even tacit folk theories alone are not going to\ndistinguish the analytic, since these all may be due as much to\npeople\u2019s (possibly mad!) empirical theories as to any special\nknowledge of meaning.\n\nA particularly vivid way to feel the force of Quine\u2019s challenge\nis afforded by a recent case that came before the Ontario Supreme\nCourt concerning whether laws that confined marriage to heterosexual\ncouples violated the equal protection clause of the constitution (see\nHalpern et al. 2001). The question was regarded as turning in\npart on the meaning of the word \u201cmarriage\u201d, and each party\nto the dispute solicited affidavits from philosophers, one of whom\nclaimed that the meaning of the word was tied to\nheterosexuality, another that it wasn\u2019t. Putting aside\nthe complex moral-political issues, Quine\u2019s challenge can be\nregarded as a reasonably sceptical request to know how any serious\ntheory of the world might settle it. It certainly wouldn\u2019t be\nsufficient merely to claim that marriage is/isn\u2019t necessarily\nheterosexual on the basis of common \u201cplatitudes,\u201d much\nless on \u201can act of rational insight [into] the propositional\ncontent itself\u201d; or because speakers found the inference from\nmarriage to heterosexuality \u201cprimitively compelling\u201d and\ncouldn\u2019t imagine gay people getting\n married![17]\n\nIndeed, some philosophers have offered some empirical evidence that\ncasts doubt on just how robust the data for the analytic might be. The\nmovement of \u201cexperimental philosophy\u201d has pointed to\nevidence of considerable malleability of subject\u2019s\n\u201cintuitions\u201d with regard to the standard kinds of thought\nexperiments on which philosophical defenses of analytic claims\ntypically rely. Thus, Weinberg, Nichols and Stich (2001) found\nsignificant cultural differences between responses of Asian and\nWestern students regarding whether someone counted as having knowledge\nin a standard \u201cGettier\u201d (1963) example of accidental\njustified true belief; and Knobe (2003) found that\nnon-philosophers\u2019 judgments about whether an action is\nintentional depended on the (particularly negative) moral qualities of\nthe action, and not, as is presumed by most philosophers, on whether\nthe action was merely intended by the agent. Questions, of course,\ncould be raised about these experimental results (How well did the\nsubjects understand the project of assessing intuitions? Did the\nexperiments sufficiently control for the multitudinous\n\u201cpragmatic\u201d effects endemic to polling procedures? To what\nextent are the target terms merely polysemous \u2013 see\nsupplement, \u00a73\u2013 allowing for different uses in\ndifferent contexts?) However, the results do serve to show how the\ndetermination of meaning and analytic truths can be regarded as a far\nmore difficult empirical question than philosophers have traditionally\nsupposed (see Bishop and Trout, 2005, and Alexander and Weinberg,\n2007, for further discussion).\n4.2 Externalist Theories of Meaning\n\nDeveloping the strategy of \u00a73.3C above, Externalist theories of\nmeaning (or \u201ccontent\u201d) try to meet at least part of\nQuine\u2019s challenge by considering how matters of meaning need not\nrely on epistemic. or really any internal\nconnections among thoughts or beliefs, in the way that many\nphilosophers had traditionally supposed, but as involving largely\ncausal and social relations between uses of words and the phenomena in\nthe world that they pick out. This suggestion gradually emerged in the\nwork of Putnam (1962 [1975], 1965 [1975] and 1975), Kripke (1972\n[1980]) and Burge (1979, 1986), but it took the form of positive\ntheories in, e.g., the work of Devitt (1981, 2015), Dretske (1988) and\nFodor (1990b), who tried to base meaning in various actual or\nco-variational causal relations between states of the mind/brain and\nexternal phenomena (see Indicator Semantics; as well as the\nwork on \u201cteleosemantics\u201d of Millikan, 1984), Papineau,\n1987, and Neander, 1995, 2017, who look to mechanisms of natural\nselection; see Teleological Theories of Mental Content).\n\nConsider, for example, Fodor\u2019s proposal. Simplifying it\nslightly, Fodor (1990b) claimed that\n\n\na symbol S means p if\n\n(i)\nunder some conditions, C, it\u2019s a law that S\nis entokened iff p, and\n(ii)\nany other tokening of S synchronically depends upon (i),\nbut not vice versa.\n\n\n\nThus, tokenings of \u201chorse\u201d mean horse because\nthere are (say, optimal viewing) conditions under which tokenings of\n\u201chorse\u201d co-vary with horses, and tokenings of\n\u201chorse\u201d caused by cows asymmetrically depend upon that\nfact. The intuitive idea here is that what makes \u201chorse\u201d\nmean horse is that errors and other tokenings of\n\u201chorse\u201d in the absence of horses (e.g., dreaming of them)\ndepend upon being able to get things right, but not vice\nversa: getting things right doesn\u2019t depend upon getting\nthem wrong. The law in (i), so to say, \u201cgoverns\u201d the\ntokenings of (ii). (Note that this condition is metaphysical,\nappealing to actual laws of entokenings, and not upon\nasymmetric dependencies between epistemic criteria suggested\nby Fodor in his defense of Putnam we discussed in \u00a73.6.2.)\n\nFodor\u2019s and related proposals are not without their problems\n(see Loewer, 1996, Rey, 2009 and Causal Theories of Mental\nContent). Nevertheless, it\u2019s worth noting that,\nwere such theories to succeed in providing the kind of\nexplanatorily adequate, non-circular account of intentionality to\nwhich they aspire, they would go some way towards saving at least\nintentional psychology from Quine\u2019s attack, and provide at least\none prima facie plausible, naturalistic strategy for\ndistinguishing facts about meaning from facts about mere belief. The\nproposals, unlike those in the traditions of Carnap or of\nneo-Cartesians, have at least the form of a serious\nreply.\n\nHowever, even if such externalist strategies, either Fodor\u2019s or\nteleosemantic ones, were to save intentionality and meaning, they\nwould do so only by forsaking the high hopes we noted in \u00a72\nphilosophers harbored for the analytic. For externalists are typically\ncommitted to counting expressions as \u201csynonymous\u201d if they\nhappen to be linked in the right way to the same external phenomena,\neven if a thinker couldn\u2019t realize that they are by a\npriori (or, at any rate, \u201carmchair\u201d) reflection\nalone. By at least the Fregean substitution criterion (\u00a71.2),\nthey would seem to be committed to counting as \u201canalytic\u201d\nmany patently empirical sentences as \u201cWater is H2O,\u201d\n\u201cSalt is NaCl\u201d or \u201cMark Twain is Samuel\nClemens,\u201d since in each of these cases, something may co-vary in\nthe relevant way with tokenings of the expression on one side of the\nidentity if and only if it co-varies with tokenings of the one on the\nother (similar problems and others arise for teleosemantics; see Fodor\n1990b, pp. 72\u201373).\n\nOf course, along the lines of the worldly turn we noted in\n\u00a73.6.3, an externalist might cheerfully just allow that some\nsentences, e.g., \u201cwater is H20,\u201d are in fact analytic,\neven though they are \u201cexternal\u201d and subject to empirical\n(dis)confirmation. Such a view would actually comport well with an\nolder philosophical tradition less interested in the meanings of our\nwords and concepts, and more interested in the\n\u201cessences\u201d of the worldly phenomena they pick\nout. Locke (1690 [1975], II, 31, vi), for example, posited\n\u201creal\u201d essences of things rather along the lines\nresuscitated by Putnam (1975) and Kripke (1972 [1980]), the real\nessences being the conditions in the world independent of our thought\nthat make something the thing it is. Thus, being H2O may be\nwhat makes something water, and (to take the striking\nexamples of diseases noted by Putnam, 1962 [1975]) being the\nactivation of a certain virus is what makes something polio. But, of\ncourse, such an external view would still dash the hopes of\nphilosophers looking to the analytic to explain a priori\nknowledge (but see Bealer 1987 and Jackson 1998 for strategies to\nassimilate such empirical cases to nevertheless a priori,\narmchair analysis). Such a consequence, however, might not faze an\nexternalist like Fodor (1998), who is concerned only to save\nintentional psychology, and might otherwise share Quine\u2019s\nscepticism about the analytic and the a priori.\n\nTwo final problems, however, loom over any such externalist\nstrategies. One is how to provide content to\n\u201cresponse-dependent\u201d terms, such as\n\u201cinteresting,\u201d \u201camusing,\u201d \u201csexy,\u201d\n\u201cworrisome,\u201d whose extensions vary greatly with users and\noccasions. What seems crucial to the contents of such terms is not any\nexternalia that they might pick out, but simply some\ninternal reactions of thinkers that might vary among them\neven under all conditions, but without difference in meaning.\nAt any rate, there\u2019s no reason to suppose there\u2019s any sort\nof law that links the same phenomena to different people who find\ndifferent things \u201cinteresting,\u201d \u201cfunny,\u201d or\neven \u201cgreen\u201d (cf. Russell, 1912; Hardin, 2008). The other\nproblem is how to distinguish necessarily empty terms that\npurport to refer to (arguably) impossible phenomena such as perfectly\nflat surfaces, Euclidean figures, fictional characters or immortal\nsouls. An externalist would seem to be committed to treating all such\nterms as synonymous, despite, of course, the fact that thoughts about\nthem should obviously be distinguished (see Rey, 2009).\n4.3 Internal Dependencies\n\nA promising strategy for replying to these latter problems, as well as\nto Quine\u2019s challenge in a way that might even begin to provide\nwhat the neo-Cartesian wants, can be found in a proposal of Paul\nHorwich (1998, 2005). He emphasizes how the meaning properties of a\nterm are the ones that play a \u201cbasic explanatory role\u201d\nwith regard to the use of a term generally, the ones ultimately in\nvirtue of which a term is used with that meaning. For example, the use\nof \u201cred\u201d to refer to the color of blood, roses, stop\nsigns, etc,. is arguably explained by its use to refer to certain\napparent colors in good light, but not vice versa: the latter\nuse is \u201cbasic\u201d to all the other uses. Similarly, uses of\n\u201cand\u201d explanatorily depend upon its basic use in\ninferences to and from the sentences it conjoins, and number terms to\nitems in a sequence respecting Peano\u2019s axioms (Horwich,\n1998:45,129; see also Devitt 1996, 2002 for a similar proposal).\n\nAlthough by allowing for purely internal explanatory conditions, this\nstrategy offers a way to deal with response-dependent and necessarily\nempty terms, and promises a way of distinguishing analyticities from\nmere beliefs, there are still several further potential problems it\nfaces. The first is that merely appealing to a \u201cbasic\nexplanatory\u201d condition for the use of a word doesn\u2019t\ndistinguish misuses and metaphors from etymologies, derived idioms and\n\u201cdead metaphors\u201d: saying \u201cJuliet is the sun\u201d\ncan be explained by the use of \u201csun\u201d to refer to the sun,\nbut so can \u201clobbying\u201d be explained by the use of\n\u201clobby\u201d for lobbies of buildings (where politicians often\nmet), and \u201cthe eye of a needle\u201d by the shape of an animal\neye. In these latter cases, the words seem to be \u201cfrozen\u201d\nor \u201cdead\u201d metaphors, taking on meanings of their own.\nWhile they are explained by original \u201cbasic\u201d\nuses, they are no longer \u201cgoverned\u201d by them.\n\nHere it may be worth combining something of the Horwich view with\nsomething of Fodor\u2019s aforementioned cousin suggestion of the\nasymmetric counterfactual (\u00a74.2), along lines suggested by Rey\n(2009; 2020a, \u00a710.3): the new \u201cdead\u201d uses of an idiom\nor metaphor no longer asymmetrically depend upon the\nexplanatorily basic use. \u201cEye of a needle\u201d would still\nmean the hole at the end of a needle, even if \u201ceye\u201d no\nlonger referred to animal eyes. But \u201ceye\u201d used to refer\nto, say, the drawing of an eye, would both asymmetrically and\nexplanatorily depend upon its being used to refer to actual eyes. And\ndescribing a three-way correspondence as \u201ctriangular\u201d may\nasymmetrically and explanatorily depend upon thinking of certain\ngeometric figures as triangular, but not vice versa \u2013\ndespite the impossibility of there ever being any actual triangles in\nthe external world (see Allott and Textor, 2022, for development of\nthis suggestion). Taking the asymmetric dependency to be\n\u201cinternally\u201d explanatory relieves it of the excessive\nexternalism with which Fodor burdened it, while avoiding the\netymologies and dead metaphors facing Horwich\u2019s view on its\nown.\n\nHowever, although such a proposal may offer a promising strategy for\nmeeting Quine\u2019s challenge about many ordinary terms, it\nisn\u2019t clear it would work for highly theoretic ones. For if\nQuine (1953 [1980a]) is right about even a limited holism involved in\nthe use of scientific terms, then there may be no sufficiently local\nbasic facts on which all other uses of a term asymmetrically and\nexplanatorily depend. To take the kind of case that most interested\nQuine, it certainly seems unlikely that there is some small set of\nuses of, say, \u201cnumber,\u201d \u201cpositron,\u201d\n\u201cspace\u201d or \u201cbiological species\u201d that are\nexplanatorily basic, on which all other uses really depend. Such terms\noften come with a large cluster of terms appearing in claims that come\nas, so to say, a loose \u201cpackage deal,\u201d and revision over\ntime may touch any particular claim in the interests of overall\nexplanatory adequacy. Uses of a term involved in the expression of\nbelief, either in thought or talk, will likely be justified and\nexplained by the same processes of holistic confirmation that led\nQuine to his scepticism about the analytic in the first place (cf.\nGibbard, 2008). Of course, Quine might be wrong about taking the case\nof theoretic terms in science to be representative of terms in human\npsychology generally (cf. Chomsky, 2000,\n footnote 10\n above), and the above proposal might be confined to some restricted\nportions of a speaker\u2019s psychology, e.g., to perception (as in\nFodor, 1983, 2000). But, to put it mildly, the verdict on these issues\nis not quite in (see supplement \u00a7\u00a74\u20135).\n\nLastly, a third (and, for some, a serious) possible drawback of this\nstrategy is that it still risks rendering matters of meaning far less\n\u201ctransparent\u201d and introspectively accessible than\nphilosophers have standardly supposed. There is little reason to\nsuppose that what is asymmetrically-explanatorily basic about\none\u2019s use of a term in thought or talk is a matter that is\navailable to introspection or armchair reflection. As in the case of\n\u201cmarriage\u201d mentioned earlier, but certainly with respect\nto other philosophically problematic notions, just which properties,\nif any, are explanatorily basic may not be an issue that is at all\neasy to determine. What are the asymmetric-explanatorily basic uses of\n\u201cfreedom\u201d or \u201csoul\u201d? Do even people\u2019s\nuses of animal terms really depend upon dubbings of species \u2013 or\nof individual exemplars \u2013 or do they depend more upon an innate\ndisposition to think in terms of underlying biological kinds (cf. Keil\n2014, pp. 327\u2013333)? Do their uses of number words and concepts\nreally depend upon their grasp of Peano\u2019s axioms? Perhaps the\nusage is grounded more in practices of (finite) counting, estimates\nand noticing merely finite one-to-one correspondences; or\nperhaps they lie in the general recursive character of\nlanguage (cf. Hauser et al 2002). Again, one may need the\nresources of a psychology that delves into far more deeply into the\ncomplex, internal causal relations in the mind than are available at\nits introspective or behavioral surface.\n4.4 Chomskyan Strategies\n\nSuch an interest in a deeper and richer internal psychology\nemerged most dramatically in the 1950s in the work of Noam Chomsky. In\nhis (1957, 1965, 1968 [2006]) he began to revolutionize linguistics by\npresenting substantial evidence and arguments for the existence of an\ninnate \u201cgenerative\u201d grammar in a special language faculty\nin people\u2019s brains that he argued was responsible for their\nunderlying competence to speak and understand natural languages. This\nopened up the possibility of a response to Quine\u2019s (1960)\nscepticism about the analytic within his own naturalistic framework,\nsimply freed of its odd behaviorism, which Chomsky and others had\nindependently, empirically refuted (see Chomsky 1959, and Gleitman,\nGross and Reisberg 2011, chapter 7). Some of it also dovetails nicely\nwith ideas of Friedrich Waismann and the later Wittgenstein, as well\nas with important recent work on polysemy. But the program Chomsky\ninitiated is complex, and its relation to the analytic quite\ncontroversial, and so discussion of it is relegated to the following\nsupplement to this entry:\n\nSupplement: Analyticity and Chomskyan Linguistics.\n \n5. Conclusion\n\nSuppose, per the discussion of at least \u00a73 of the\nsupplement, that linguistics were to succeed in\ndelineating a class of analytic sentences grounded in the constraints\nof a special language faculty in the way that some Chomskyans\nsometimes seem to suggest. Would such sentences serve the purposes for\nwhich we noted earlier (\u00a72) philosophers had enlisted them?\nPerhaps some of them would. An empirical grounding of the analytic\nmight provide us with an understanding of what constitutes a\nperson\u2019s competence with specific words and concepts,\nparticularly logical or mathematical ones. Given that Quinean\nscepticism about the analytic is a source of his scepticism about the\ndeterminacy of cognitive states (see \u00a73.5 above), such a\ngrounding may be crucial for a realistic psychology, determining the\nconditions under which someone has a thought with a specific\ncontent.\n\nMoreover, setting out the constitutive conditions for possessing a\nconcept might be of some interest to philosophers generally, since\nmany of the crucial questions they ask concern the proper\nunderstanding of ordinary notions such as material object, person,\naction, freedom, god, the good, or the beautiful.\nSuppose, further, that a domain, such as perhaps ethics or aesthetics,\nis \u201cresponse dependent,\u201d constituted by the\nunderlying rules of our words and concepts; suppose, that is, that\nthese rules constitute the nature of, say, the good, the\nfunny, or the beautiful. If so, then it might not be\nimplausible to claim that successful conceptual analysis could provide\nus with some a priori knowledge of such domains (although,\nagain, sorting out the rules may require empirical linguistic and\npsychological theories not available to \u201carmchair\nreflection\u201d).\n\nBut, of course, many philosophers have wanted more than these\nessentially psychological gains. They have hoped that analytic claims\nmight provide a basis for a priori knowledge of domains that\nexist independently of us and are not exhausted by our concepts. An\nimportant case in point would seem to be the very case of arithmetic\nthat motivated much of the discussion of the analytic in the first\nplace. Recent work of Crispin Wright (1983) and others on the logicist\nprogram has shown how a version of Frege\u2019s program might be\nrescued by appealing not to his problematic Basic Law V, but instead\nmerely to what is called \u201cHume\u2019s Principle,\u201d or the\nclaim that for the number of Fs to be equal to the number\nof Gs is for there to be a \u201cone-to-one\ncorrespondence\u201d between the Fs and the Gs (as in the case of the\nfingers of a normal right and left hand), even in infinite cases.\nAccording to what is now regarded as \u201cFrege\u2019s\nTheorem,\u201d the Peano axioms for arithmetic can be derived from\nthis principle in standard second-order logic (see Frege\u2019s\ntheorem and foundations for arithmetic).\n\nNow, Wright has urged that Hume\u2019s Principle might be regarded as\nanalytic, and perhaps this claim could be sustained by an examination\nof the language faculty along the lines of a Chomskyan linguistics set\nout in the supplement. If so, then wouldn\u2019t that\nvindicate the suggestion that arithmetic can be known a\npriori? Not obviously, since Hume\u2019s Principle is a claim\nnot merely about the concepts F and G, but about the\npresumably concept-independent fact about the number of\nthings that are F and the number of things that are G, and, we can\nask, what justifies any claim about them? As George Boolos (1997)\nasked in response to Wright:\n\n\nIf numbers are supposed to be identical if and only if the concepts\nthey are numbers of are equinumerous, what guarantee do we have that\nevery concept has a number? (p. 253)\n\n\nIndeed, as Edward Zalta (2013) observes,\n\n\nThe basic problem for Frege\u2019s strategy, however, is that for his\nlogicist project to succeed, his system must at some point include\n(either as an axiom or theorem) statements that explicitly assert the\nexistence of certain kinds of abstract entities and it is not obvious\nhow to justify the claim that we know such explicit existential\nstatements. (2013, Section 6.2)\n\n\nThe concept of a unique successor to every number might be a defining\nfeature of the lexical item, \u201cnumber,\u201d but that\ndoesn\u2019t itself imply that an infinity of numbers actually\nexists. Meanings and concepts are one thing; reality quite\nanother. Justification of such existential statements and, with them,\nHume\u2019s Principle would seem to have to involve something more\nthan appealing to merely the concept, but also \u2014to recall\nQuine\u2019s (CLT, p. 121, \u00a73.3 above) claim\u2014 to\n\u201cthe elegance and convenience which the hypothesis brings to the\ncontaining bodies of laws and data,\u201d i.e., to our best overall\nempirical theory of the world, irrespective of what constraints\nlanguage might impose (see Wright, 1999, and Horwich, 2000, for\nfurther discussion).\n\nThe problem here becomes even more obvious in non-mathematical cases.\nFor example, philosophers have wanted to claim not merely that our\nconcepts of red and green exclude the possibility of\nour thinking that something is both colors all over, but that this\npossibility is ruled out for the actual colors,\nred and green,\nthemselves (if such there be). It is therefore no accident that\nBonjour\u2019s (1998, pp. 184\u20135) defense of a priori\nknowledge turns on resuscitating views of Aristotle and Aquinas,\naccording to which the very properties of red and\ngreen themselves are constituents of\nthe propositions we grasp. But it is just such a wonderful coincidence\nbetween merely our concepts and actual worldly\nproperties that a linguistic semantics alone obviously cannot\nensure.\n\nBut suppose, nevertheless, there did in fact exist a\ncorrespondence between our concepts and the world, indeed, a deeply\nreliable, counterfactual-supporting correspondence whereby it was in\nfact metaphysically impossible for certain claims\nconstitutive of those concepts not to be true. This is, of course, not\nimplausible in the case of logic and arithmetic, and is entirely\ncompatible with, e.g., Boolos\u2019 reasonable doubts about them\n(after all, it\u2019s always possible to doubt what is in fact a\nnecessary truth). Such necessary correspondences between thought and\nthe world might then serve as a basis for claims to a priori\nknowledge in at least a reliabilist epistemology, where what\u2019s\nimportant is not believers\u2019 abilities to justify their\nclaims, but merely the reliability of the processes by which\nthey arrive at them (see Reliabilist Epistemology). Indeed,\nin the case of logic and arithmetic, the beliefs might be arrived at\nby steps that were not only necessarily reliable, but might\nalso be taken to be so by believers, in ways that might in fact depend\nin no way upon experience, but only on their competence with the\nrelevant words and concepts (Kitcher 1980; Rey 1998; and Goldman 1999\nexplore this strategy).\n\nSuch a reliabilist approach, though, might be less than fully\nsatisfying to someone interested in the traditional analytic a\npriori. For, although someone might turn out in fact to have\nanalytic a priori knowledge of this sort, she might not\nknow that she does (reliabilist epistemologists standardly\nforgo the \u201cKK Principle,\u201d according to which if one knows\nthat p, one knows that one knows that p). Knowledge that the\nrelevant claims were knowable a priori might itself be only\npossible by an empirically informed understanding of one\u2019s\nlanguage faculty and other cognitive capacities \u00e0 la\nChomsky, and by its consonance with the rest of one\u2019s theory of\nthe world, \u00e0 la Quine. One would only know a\nposteriori that something was knowable a priori.\n\nThe trouble then is that claims that people do have a capacity for\na priori knowledge seem quite precarious. As we noted earlier\n (footnote 7),\n people are often unreliable at appreciating deductively valid\narguments; and appreciating the standard rules even of natural\ndeduction is for many people often a difficult intellectual\nachievement. Consequently, people\u2019s general competence with\nlogical notions may not in fact consist in any grip on valid logical\nrules; and so whatever rules do underlie that competence may well turn\nout not to be the kind of absolutely reliable guide to the\nworld on which the above reliabilist defense of a priori\nanalytic knowledge seems to depend. In any case, in view merely of the\nserious possibility that these pessimistic conclusions are true,\nit\u2019s hard to see how any appeal to the analytic to establish the\ntruth of any controversial claim in any mind-independent domain could\nhave any special justificatory force without a sufficiently detailed,\nempirical psychological theory to back it up.\n\nMoreover, even if we did have a true account of our minds and the\nsemantic rules afforded by our linguistic and conceptual competence,\nit\u2019s not clear it would really serve the \u201carmchair\u201d\npurposes of traditional philosophy that we mentioned at the outset\n(\u00a71). Consider, for example, the common puzzle about the\npossibility that computers might actually think and enjoy a mental\nlife. In response to this puzzle some philosophers, e.g, Wittgenstein\n(1953 [1967], \u00a7\u00a7111, 281), Ziff, 1959, and Hacker, 1990,\nhave suggested that it\u2019s analytic that a thinking thing must be\nalive, a suggestion that certainly seems to accord with many\nfolk intuitions (many people who might cheerfully accept a\ncomputational explanation of a thought process often balk at the\nsuggestion that an inanimate machine engaging in that computation\nwould actually be thinking). Now, as we noted in the\nsupplement, \u00a72, Chomsky (2000, p. 44) explicitly\nendorses this suggestion. So suppose then this claim were in fact\nsustained by linguistic theory, showing that the lexical item\n\u201cthink\u201d is, indeed, constrained by the feature [+animate],\nand so is not felicitously applied to artifactual computers. Should\nthis really satisfy the person worried about the possibility of\nartificial thought?\n\nIt\u2019s hard to see why. For the serious question that concerns\npeople worried about whether artifacts could think concerns whether\nthose artifacts could in fact share the genuine, theoretically\ninteresting, explanatory properties of a thinking thing (cf.\nJackson 1998, pp. 34\u20135). We might have no empirical, scientific\nreason to suppose that genuine, biological animacy (n.b., not\nmerely the perhaps purely syntactic, linguistic feature\n[+animate]!; see supplement \u00a72) actually figures among\nthem. And so we might conclude that, despite these supposed\nconstraints of natural language, inanimate computers could come to\n\u201cthink\u201d after all. Indeed, perhaps, the claim that\nthinking things must be alive is an example of a claim that is\nanalytic but false, rather as the belief that cats are\nanimals would be, should it turn that the things are actually robots\nfrom Mars; and so we should pursue the option of polysemy and\n\u201copen texture\u201d that Chomsky also endorses, and proceed to\nallow that artifacts could think.\n\nOf course, a speaker could choose not to go along with, so to say,\nopening the texture this far. But if the explanatory point were\nnevertheless correct, other speakers could of course simply proceed to\ndefine a new word \u201cthink*\u201d that lacks the animacy\nconstraint and applies to the explanatory kind that in fact turns out\nto include, equally, humans and appropriately programmed artifacts.\nThe issue would reduce to merely a verbal quibble: so computers\ndon\u2019t \u201cthink\u201d; they \u201cthink*\u201d instead.\nIndeed, it\u2019s a peculiar feature of the entire discussion of the\nanalytic that it can seem to turn on what may in the end be mere\nverbal quibbles. Perhaps the \u201clinguist turn\u201d of philosophy\nthat we sketched in \u00a7\u00a71.2\u20133.3 led into a blind alley,\nand it would be more fruitful to explore, so far as possible,\nconceptual and/or explanatory connections that may exist in our minds\nor or in the world to a large extent independently of language.\n\nIn any case, while the semantic conditions of a language might provide\na basis for securing a priori knowledge of claims about\nmind-dependent domains, such as those of perhaps ethics and\naesthetics, in the case of mind-independent domains, such as\nlogic and mathematics, or the nature of worldly phenomena such as life\nor thought, the prospects seem more problematic. There may be analytic\nclaims to be had here, but at least in these cases they would, in the\nimmortal words of Putnam (1965 [1975], p. 36), \u201ccut no\nphilosophical ice\u2026bake no philosophical bread and wash no\nphilosophical\n windows.\u201d[18]\n We would just have to be satisfied with theorizing about the\nmind-independent domains themselves, without being able to justify our\nclaims about them by appeal to the meanings of our words alone.\nReflecting on the difficulties of the past century\u2019s efforts on\nbehalf of the analytic, it\u2019s not clear why anyone would really\nwant to insist otherwise.",
