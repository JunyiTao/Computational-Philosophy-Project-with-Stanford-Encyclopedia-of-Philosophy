    "preamble": "\n\n\nGeorge Berkeley, Bishop of Cloyne, was one of the great philosophers\nof the early modern period. He was a brilliant critic of his\npredecessors, particularly Descartes, Malebranche, and Locke. He was a\ntalented metaphysician famous for defending idealism, that is, the\nview that reality consists exclusively of minds and their\nideas. Berkeley\u2019s system, while it strikes many as counter-intuitive,\nis strong and flexible enough to counter most objections. His\nmost-studied works, the Treatise Concerning the Principles of\nHuman Knowledge (Principles, for short) and Three\nDialogues between Hylas and Philonous (Dialogues), are\nbeautifully written and dense with the sort of arguments that delight\ncontemporary philosophers. He was also a wide-ranging thinker with\ninterests in religion (which were fundamental to his philosophical\nmotivations), the psychology of vision, mathematics, physics, morals,\neconomics, and medicine.  Although many of Berkeley\u2019s first readers\ngreeted him with incomprehension, he influenced both Hume and Kant,\nand is much read (if little followed) in our own day.\n",

    "main_text": "\n1. Life and philosophical works\n\n Berkeley was born in 1685 near Kilkenny, Ireland. After several\nyears of schooling at Kilkenny College, he entered Trinity College, in\nDublin, at age 15. He was made a fellow of Trinity College in\n1707 (three years after graduating) and was ordained in the Anglican\nChurch shortly thereafter. At Trinity, where the curriculum was\nnotably modern, Berkeley encountered the new science and philosophy of\nthe late seventeenth century, which was characterized by hostility\ntowards Aristotelianism. Berkeley\u2019s philosophical notebooks\n(sometimes styled the Philosophical Commentaries), which he\nbegan in 1707, provide rich documentation of Berkeley\u2019s early\nphilosophical evolution, enabling the reader to track the emergence of\nhis immaterialist philosophy from a critical response to Descartes,\nLocke, Malebranche, Newton, Hobbes, and others.\n\n Berkeley\u2019s first important published work, An Essay Towards a New\nTheory of Vision (1709), was an influential contribution to the\npsychology of vision and also developed doctrines relevant to his\nidealist project. In his mid-twenties, he published his most enduring\nworks, the Treatise concerning the Principles of Human\nKnowledge (1710) and the Three Dialogues between Hylas and\nPhilonous (1713), whose central doctrines we will examine\nbelow.\n\n In 1720, while completing a four-year tour of Europe as tutor to a\nyoung man, Berkeley composed De Motu, a tract on the\nphilosophical foundations of mechanics which developed his views on\nphilosophy of science and articulated an instrumentalist approach to\nNewtonian dynamics. After his continental tour, Berkeley returned to\nIreland and resumed his position at Trinity until 1724, when he was\nappointed Dean of Derry. At this time, Berkeley began developing his\nscheme for founding a college in Bermuda. He was convinced that Europe\nwas in spiritual decay and that the New World offered hope\nfor a new golden age. Having secured a charter and promises of funding\nfrom the British Parliament, Berkeley set sail for America in 1728,\nwith his new bride, Anne Forster. They spent three years in Newport,\nRhode Island, awaiting the promised money, but Berkeley\u2019s political\nsupport had collapsed and they were forced to abandon the project and\nreturn to Britain in 1731. While in America, Berkeley composed\nAlciphron,  a work of Christian apologetics directed\nagainst the \u201cfree-thinkers\u201d whom he took to be enemies of established\nAnglicanism. Alciphron is also a significant philosophical\nwork and a crucial source of Berkeley\u2019s views on language.\n\n Shortly after returning to London, Berkeley composed the Theory\nof Vision, Vindicated and Explained, a defense of his earlier\nwork on vision, and the Analyst, an acute and influential\ncritique of the foundations of Newton\u2019s calculus. In 1734 he was made\nBishop of Cloyne, and thus he returned to Ireland. It was here that\nBerkeley wrote his last, strangest, and best-selling (in his own\nlifetime) philosophical work. Siris (1744) has a three-fold\naim:  to establish the virtues of tar-water (a liquid prepared by\nletting pine tar stand in water) as a medical panacea, to provide\nscientific background supporting the efficacy of tar-water, and to\nlead the mind of the reader, via gradual steps, toward contemplation\nof God. Berkeley died in 1753, shortly after moving to Oxford to\nsupervise the education of his son George, one of the three out of\nseven of his children to survive childhood.\n2. Berkeley\u2019s critique of materialism in the Principles and Dialogues\n\n In his two great works of metaphysics, Berkeley defends idealism by\nattacking the materialist alternative. What exactly is the doctrine\nthat he\u2019s attacking? Readers should first note that\n\u201cmaterialism\u201d is here used to mean \u201cthe doctrine\nthat material things exist\u201d. This is in contrast with another\nuse, more standard in contemporary discussions, according to which\nmaterialism is the doctrine that only material things\nexist. Berkeley contends that no material things exist, not\njust that some immaterial things exist. Thus, he attacks Cartesian and\nLockean dualism, not just the considerably less popular (in\nBerkeley\u2019s time) view, held by Hobbes, that only material things\nexist. But what exactly is a material thing?  Interestingly, part\nof Berkeley\u2019s attack on matter is to argue that this question cannot\nbe satisfactorily answered by the materialists, that they cannot\ncharacterize their supposed material things.  However, an answer\nthat captures what exactly it is that Berkeley rejects is that\nmaterial things are mind-independent things or\nsubstances. And a mind-independent thing is something whose existence\nis not dependent on thinking/perceiving things, and thus would exist\nwhether or not any thinking things (minds) existed. Berkeley holds\nthat there are no such mind-independent things, that, in the famous\nphrase, esse est percipi (aut percipere) \u2014 to be is to\nbe perceived (or to perceive).\n\n Berkeley charges that materialism promotes skepticism and atheism:\nskepticism because materialism implies that our senses mislead us as\nto the natures of these material things, which moreover need not exist\nat all, and atheism because a material world could be expected to run\nwithout the assistance of God. This double charge provides Berkeley\u2019s\nmotivation for questioning materialism (one which he thinks\nshould motivate others as well), though not, of course, a\nphilosophical argument against materialism. Fortunately, the\nPrinciples and Dialogues overflow with such\narguments. Below, we will examine some of the main elements of\nBerkeley\u2019s argumentative campaign against matter.\n2.1 The attack on representationalist materialism\n2.1.1 The core argument\n                       \n The starting point of Berkeley\u2019s attack on the materialism of his\ncontemporaries is a very short argument presented in\nPrinciples 4:\n\n  It is indeed an opinion strangely prevailing amongst men, that\nhouses, mountains, rivers, and in a word all sensible objects have an\nexistence natural or real, distinct from their being perceived by the\nunderstanding. But with how great an assurance and acquiescence soever\nthis principle may be entertained in the world; yet whoever shall find\nin his heart to call it in question, may, if I mistake not, perceive it\nto involve a manifest contradiction. For what are the forementioned\nobjects but the things we perceive by sense, and what do we perceive\nbesides our own ideas or sensations; and is it not plainly repugnant\nthat any one of these or any combination of them should exist\nunperceived?\n \n\n Berkeley presents here the following argument (see Winkler 1989,\n138):\n\n\n(1) We perceive ordinary objects (houses, mountains, etc.).\n\n\n (2) We perceive only ideas.\n\n Therefore,\n\n (3) Ordinary objects are ideas.\n\n\n The argument is valid, and premise (1) looks hard to deny.  What\nabout premise (2)?  Berkeley believes that this premise is accepted by\nall the modern philosophers. In the Principles, Berkeley is\noperating within the idea-theoretic tradition of the\nseventeenth and eighteenth centuries. In particular, Berkeley believes\nthat some version of this premise is accepted by his main targets, the\ninfluential philosophers Descartes and Locke.\n\n However, Berkeley recognizes that these philosophers have an obvious\nresponse available to this argument. This response blocks Berkeley\u2019s\ninference to (3) by distinguishing two sorts of perception, mediate\nand immediate. Thus, premises (1) and (2) are replaced by the claims\nthat (1\u2032) we mediately perceive ordinary objects, while\n(2\u2032) we immediately perceive only ideas.  From these claims, of\ncourse, no idealist conclusion follows. The response reflects a\nrepresentationalist theory of perception, according to which\nwe indirectly (mediately) perceive material things, by directly\n(immediately) perceiving ideas, which are mind-dependent items. The\nideas represent external material objects, and thereby allow\nus to perceive them.\n\n Whether Descartes, Malebranche, and Locke were representationalists\nof this kind is a matter of some controversy (see e.g. Yolton 1984,\nChappell 1994). However, Berkeley surely had good grounds for\nunderstanding his predecessors in this way: it reflects the most\nobvious interpretation of Locke\u2019s account of perception and\nDescartes\u2019 whole procedure in the Meditations tends to\nsuggest this sort of view, given the meditator\u2019s situation as someone\ncontemplating her own ideas, trying to determine whether something\nexternal corresponds to them.\n2.1.2 The likeness principle\n\n Berkeley devotes the succeeding sections of the Principles\nto undermining the representationalist response to his initial\nargument. In effect, he poses the question: What allows an idea to\nrepresent a material object?  He assumes, again with good grounds,\nthat the representationalist answer is going to involve\nresemblance: \n\n But say you, though the ideas themselves do not exist without the\nmind, yet there may be things like them whereof they are copies or\nresemblances, which things exist without the mind, in an unthinking\nsubstance. I answer, an idea can be like nothing but an idea; a colour\nor figure can be like nothing but another colour or figure. (PHK\n8)\n \n\n Berkeley argues that this supposed resemblance is nonsensical; an\nidea can only be like another idea. \n\n But why?  The closest Berkeley ever comes to directly addressing this\nquestion is in his early philosophical notebooks, where he observes\nthat \u201cTwo things cannot be said to be alike or unlike till they\nhave been compar\u2019d\u201d (PC 377). Thus, because the mind can compare\nnothing but its own ideas, which by hypothesis are the only things\nimmediately perceivable, the representationalist cannot assert a\nlikeness between an idea and a non-ideal mind-independent material\nobject. (For further discussion, see Winkler 1989, 145\u20139.)\n\n If Berkeley\u2019s Likeness Principle, the thesis that an idea can only be\nlike another idea, is granted, representationalist materialism is in\nserious trouble. For how are material objects now to be characterized?\nIf material objects are supposed to be extended, solid, or colored,\nBerkeley will counter that these sensory qualities pertain to ideas,\nto that which is immediately perceived, and that the materialist\ncannot assert that material objects are like ideas in these ways. Many\npassages in the Principles and Dialogues drive home\nthis point, arguing that matter is, if not an incoherent notion, at\nbest a completely empty one.\n2.1.3 Anti-abstractionism\n\n One way in which Berkeley\u2019s anti-abstractionism comes into play is in\nreinforcing this point. Berkeley argues in the\n\u201cIntroduction\u201d to the\n Principles[1]\n that we cannot form general ideas in the way that Locke often seems\nto suggest\u2014by stripping particularizing qualities from an idea\nof a particular, creating a new, intrinsically general,\nabstract\n idea.[2]\n Berkeley then claims that notions the materialist might invoke in a\nlast-ditch attempt to characterize matter, e.g. being or mere\nextension, are objectionably abstract and\n unavailable.[3]\n2.1.4 What does materialism explain?\n\n Berkeley is aware that the materialist has one important card left to\nplay: Don\u2019t we need material objects in order to explain our\nideas?  And indeed, this seems intuitively gripping: Surely the best\nexplanation of the fact that I have a chair idea every time I enter my\noffice and that my colleague has a chair idea when she enters\nmy office is that a single enduring material object causes\nall these various ideas. Again, however, Berkeley replies by\neffectively exploiting the weaknesses of his opponents\u2019 theories:\n\n \u2026though we give the materialists their external bodies, they\nby their own confession are never the nearer knowing how our ideas are\nproduced: since they own themselves unable to comprehend in what manner\nbody can act upon spirit, or how it is possible it should imprint any\nidea in the mind. Hence it is evident the production of ideas or\nsensations in our minds, can be no reason why we should suppose matter\nor corporeal substances, since that is acknowledged to remain equally\ninexplicable with, or without this supposition. (PHK 19)\n \n\n Firstly, Berkeley contends, a representationalist must admit that we\ncould have our ideas without there being any external objects\ncausing them (PHK 18). (This is one way in which Berkeley sees\nmaterialism as leading to skepticism.)  More devastatingly, however,\nhe must admit that the existence of matter does not help to explain\nthe occurrence of our ideas. After all, Locke himself diagnosed the\ndifficulty:\n\n Body as far as we can conceive being able only to strike and affect\nbody; and Motion, according to the utmost reach of our Ideas,\nbeing able to produce nothing but Motion, so that when we allow it to\nproduce pleasure or pain, or the Idea of a Colour, or Sound,\nwe are fain to quit our Reason, go beyond our Ideas, and\nattribute it wholly to the good Pleasure of our Maker. (Locke 1975,\n541;Essay 4.3.6)\n \n\n And, when Descartes was pressed by Elizabeth as to how mind\nand body\n interact,[4]\n she rightly regarded his answers as unsatisfactory. The basic problem\nhere is set by dualism: how can one substance causally affect another\nsubstance of a fundamentally different kind?  In its\nCartesian form, the difficulty is particularly severe: how can an\nextended thing, which affects other extended things only by mechanical\nimpact, affect a mind, which is non-extended and\nnon-spatial?\n\n Berkeley\u2019s point is thus well taken. It is worth noting that, in\naddition to undermining the materialist\u2019s attempted inference to the\nbest explanation, Berkeley\u2019s point also challenges any attempt to\nexplain representation and mediate perception in terms of\ncausation. That is, the materialist might try to claim that ideas\nrepresent material objects, not by resemblance, but in virtue of being\ncaused by the objects. (Though neither Descartes nor Locke\nspells out such an account, there are grounds in each for attributing\nsuch an account to them. For Descartes see Wilson 1999, 73\u201376; for\nLocke see Chappell 1994, 53.)  However, PHK 19 implies that the\nmaterialists are not in a position to render this account of\nrepresentation philosophically satisfactory.\n2.2 Contra direct realist materialism\n\n As emphasized above, Berkeley\u2019s campaign against matter, as he\npresents it in the Principles, is directed against\nmaterialist representationalism and presupposes\nrepresentationalism. In particular, Berkeley presupposes that all\nanyone ever directly or immediately perceives are ideas. As\ncontemporary philosophers, we might wonder whether Berkeley has\nanything to say to a materialist who denies this representationalist\npremise and asserts instead that we ordinarily directly/immediately\nperceive material objects themselves. The answer is\n\u2018yes\u2019.\n2.2.1 The master argument?\n\n However, one place where one might naturally look for such an\nargument is not, in fact, as promising as might initially appear. In\nboth the Principles (22\u20133) and the Dialogues (200),\nBerkeley gives a version of what has come to be called \u201cThe\nMaster\n Argument\u201d[5]\n because of the apparent strength with which he endorses it:\n\n \u2026 I am content to put the whole upon this issue; if you can\nbut conceive it possible for one extended moveable substance, or in\ngeneral, for any one idea or any thing like an idea, to exist\notherwise than in a mind perceiving it, I shall readily give up the\ncause\u2026. But say you, surely there is nothing easier than to\nimagine trees, for instance, in a park, or books existing in a closet,\nand no body by to perceive them. I answer, you may so, there is no\ndifficulty in it: but what is all this, I beseech you, more than\nframing in your mind certain ideas which you call books and\ntrees, and at the same time omitting to frame the idea of any\none that may perceive them? But do not you your self perceive or think\nof them all the while? This therefore is nothing to the purpose: it\nonly shows you have the power of imagining or forming ideas in your\nmind; but it doth not shew that you can conceive it possible, the\nobjects of your thought may exist without the mind: to make out this,\nit is necessary that you conceive them existing unconceived or\nunthought of, which is a manifest repugnancy. When we do our utmost to\nconceive the existence of external bodies, we are all the while only\ncontemplating our own ideas. But the mind taking no notice of itself,\nis deluded to think it can and doth conceive bodies existing unthought\nof or without the mind; though at the same time they are apprehended\nby or exist in it self. (PHK 22\u201323)\n \n\n The argument seems intended to establish that we cannot actually\nconceive of mind-independent objects, that is, objects existing\nunperceived and unthought of. Why not?  Simply because in order to\nconceive of any such things, we must ourselves be conceiving,\ni.e., thinking, of them. However, as Pitcher (1977, 113) nicely observes,\nsuch an argument seems to conflate the representation (what\nwe conceive with) and the represented (what we\nconceive of\u2014the content of our thought). Once we make\nthis distinction, we realize that although we must have some\nconception or representation in order to conceive of something, and\nthat representation is in some sense thought of, it does not\nfollow (contra Berkeley) that what we conceive of must be a\nthought-of object. That is, when we imagine a tree standing alone in a\nforest, we (arguably) conceive of an unthought-of object, though of\ncourse we must employ a thought in order to accomplish this\n feat.[6]\n  Thus (as many commentators have observed), this argument\nfails.\n\n A more charitable reading of the argument (see Winkler 1989, 184\u20137;\nLennon 1988) makes Berkeley\u2019s point that we cannot represent\nunconceivedness, because we have never and could never experience\n it.[7]\n  Because we cannot represent unconceivedness, we cannot conceive of\nmind-independent objects. While this is a rather more promising\nargument, it clearly presupposes representationalism, just as\nBerkeley\u2019s earlier Principles arguments\n did.[8] \n (This, however, is not necessarily a defect of the interpretation,\nsince the Principles, as we saw above, is aimed against\nrepresentationalism, and in the Dialogues the Master Argument\ncrops up only after Hylas has been converted to representationalism\n(see\n below).)[9]\n2.2.2 The First Dialogue and relativity arguments\n\n Thus, if we seek a challenge to direct realist materialism, we must\nturn to the Three Dialogues, where the character Hylas (the\nwould-be materialist) begins from a sort of na\u00efve realism,\naccording to which we perceive material objects themselves,\ndirectly. Against this position, Philonous (lover of\nspirit\u2014Berkeley\u2019s spokesperson) attempts to argue that the\nsensible qualities\u2014the qualities immediately perceived by\nsense\u2014must be ideal, rather than belonging to material\nobjects. (The following analysis of these first dialogue arguments is\nindebted to Margaret Wilson\u2019s account in \u201cBerkeley on the\nMind-Dependence of Colors,\u201d Wilson 1999,\n 229\u2013242.[10])\n\n Philonous begins his first argument by contending that sensible\nqualities such as heat are not distinct from pleasure or pain.\nPleasure and pain, Philonous argues, are allowed by all to be merely\nin the mind; therefore the same must be true for the sensible\nqualities. The most serious difficulties with this argument are (1)\nwhether we should grant the \u201cno distinction\u201d premise in\nthe case of the particular sensory qualities invoked by Berkeley (why\nnot suppose that I can distinguish between the heat and the pain?)\nand (2) if we do, whether we should generalize to all sensory\nqualities as Berkeley would have us do.\n\n Secondly, Philonous invokes relativity arguments to suggest that\nbecause sensory qualities are relative to the perceiver, e.g. what is\nhot to one hand may be cold to the other and what is sweet to one\nperson may be bitter to another, they cannot belong to\nmind-independent material objects, for such objects could not bear\ncontradictory qualities.\n\n  As Berkeley is well aware, one may reply to this sort of argument by\nclaiming that only one of the incompatible qualities is truly a\nquality of the object and that the other apparent qualities result\nfrom misperception. But how then, Berkeley asks, are these\n\u201ctrue\u201d qualities to be identified and distinguished from\nthe \u201cfalse\u201d ones (3D 184)?  By noting the differences\nbetween animal perception and human perception, Berkeley suggests that\nit would be arbitrary anthropocentrism to claim that humans have\nspecial access to the true qualities of objects.  Further, Berkeley\nuses the example of microscopes to undermine the prima facie\nplausible thought that the true visual qualities of objects are\nrevealed by close examination. Thus, Berkeley provides a strong\nchallenge to any direct realist attempt to specify standard conditions\nunder which the true (mind-independent) qualities of objects are\n(directly) perceived by sense.\n\n Under this pressure from Philonous, Hylas retreats (perhaps a bit\nquickly) from na\u00efve realism to a more \u201cphilosophical\u201d\nposition. He first tries to make use of the primary/secondary quality\ndistinction associated with mechanism and, again, locatable in the\nthought of Descartes and Locke. Thus, Hylas allows that color, taste,\netc. may be mind-dependent (secondary) qualities, but contends that\nfigure, solidity, motion and rest (the primary qualities) exist in\nmind-independent material bodies. The mechanist picture behind this\nproposal is that bodies are composed of particles with size, shape,\nmotion/rest, and perhaps solidity, and that our sensory ideas arise\nfrom the action of such particles on our sense organs and, ultimately,\non our minds. Berkeley opposes this sort of mechanism throughout his\nwritings, believing that it engenders skepticism by dictating that\nbodies are utterly unlike our sensory experience of them. Here\nPhilonous has a two-pronged reply: (1) The same sorts of relativity\narguments that were made against secondary qualities can be made\nagainst primary ones. (2) We cannot abstract the primary qualities\n(e.g. shape) from secondary ones (e.g.  color), and thus we cannot\nconceive of mechanist material bodies which are extended but not (in\nthemselves)\n colored.[11]\n\n When, after some further struggles, Hylas finally capitulates to\nPhilonous\u2019 view that all of existence is mind-dependent, he does so\nunhappily and with great reluctance. Philonous needs to convince him\n(as Berkeley needed to convince his readers in both books) that a\ncommonsensical philosophy could be built on an immaterialist\nfoundation, that no one but a skeptic or atheist would ever miss\nmatter. As a matter of historical fact, Berkeley persuaded few of his\ncontemporaries, who for the most part regarded him as a purveyor of\nskeptical paradoxes (Bracken 1965). Nevertheless, we can and should\nappreciate the way in which Berkeley articulated a positive idealist\nphilosophical system, which, if not in perfect accord with common\nsense, is in many respects superior to its competitors.\n3. Berkeley\u2019s positive program: idealism and common sense\n3.1 The basics of Berkeley\u2019s ontology\n3.1.1 The status of ordinary objects\n\n The basics of Berkeley\u2019s metaphysics are apparent from the first\nsection of the main body of the Principles:\n\n It is evident to any one who takes a survey of the objects of human\nknowledge, that they are either ideas actually imprinted on the\nsenses, or else such as are perceived by attending to the passions and\noperations of the mind, or lastly ideas formed by help of memory and\nimagination, either compounding, dividing, or barely representing\nthose originally perceived in the aforesaid ways. By sight I have the\nideas of light and colours with their several degrees and\nvariations. By touch I perceive, for example, hard and soft, heat and\ncold, motion and resistance, and of all these more and less either as\nto quantity or degree. Smelling furnishes me with odours; the palate\nwith tastes, and hearing conveys sounds to the mind in all their\nvariety of tone and composition. And as several of these are observed\nto accompany each other, they come to be marked by one name, and so to\nbe reputed as one thing. Thus, for example, a certain colour, taste,\nsmell, figure and consistence having been observed to go together, are\naccounted one distinct thing, signified by the name apple. Other\ncollections of ideas constitute a stone, a tree, a book, and the like\nsensible things; which, as they are pleasing or disagreeable, excite\nthe passions of love, hatred, joy, grief, and so forth.\n \n\n As this passage illustrates, Berkeley does not deny the existence of\nordinary objects such as stones, trees, books, and apples. On the\ncontrary, as was indicated above, he holds that only an immaterialist\naccount of such objects can avoid skepticism about their existence and\nnature. What such objects turn out to be, on his account, are bundles\nor collections of ideas. An apple is a combination of visual ideas\n(including the sensible qualities of color and visual shape), tangible\nideas, ideas of taste, smell,\n etc.[12] \n The question of what does the combining is a philosophically\ninteresting one which Berkeley does not address in detail. He does\nmake clear that there are two sides to the process of bundling ideas\ninto objects: (1) co-occurrence, an objective fact about what sorts of\nideas tend to accompany each other in our experience, and (2) something we\ndo when we decide to single out a set of co-occurring ideas and refer\nto it with a certain name (NTV 109).\n\n Thus, although there is no material world for Berkeley, there is a\nphysical world, a world of ordinary objects. This world is\nmind-dependent, for it is composed of ideas, whose existence consists\nin being perceived. For ideas, and so for the physical world, esse\nest percipi. \n3.1.2 Spirits as active substances\n\n Berkeley\u2019s ontology is not exhausted by the ideal, however. In\naddition to perceived things (ideas), he posits perceivers, i.e., minds\nor spirits, as he often terms them. Spirits, he emphasizes,\nare totally different in kind from ideas, for they are active where\nideas are passive. This suggests that Berkeley has replaced one kind\nof dualism, of mind and matter, with another kind of dualism, of mind\nand idea. There is something to this point, given Berkeley\u2019s refusal\nto elaborate upon the relation between active minds and passive\nideas. At Principles 49, he famously dismisses quibbling about\nhow ideas inhere in the mind (are minds colored and extended\nwhen such sensible qualities \u201cexist in\u201d them?) with the\ndeclaration that \u201cthose qualities are in the mind only as they\nare perceived by it, that is, not by way of mode or\nattribute, but only by way of idea\u201d. Berkeley\u2019s\ndualism, however, is a dualism within the realm of the\nmind-dependent.\n3.1.3 God\u2019s existence\n\n The last major item in Berkeley\u2019s ontology is God, himself a spirit,\nbut an infinite one. Berkeley believes that once he has established\nidealism, he has a novel and convincing argument for God\u2019s existence\nas the cause of our sensory ideas. He argues by elimination: What\ncould cause my sensory ideas?  Candidate causes, supposing that\nBerkeley has already established that matter doesn\u2019t exist, are (1)\nother ideas, (2) myself, or (3) some other spirit. Berkeley eliminates\nthe first option with the following argument (PHK 25):\n\n\n(1) Ideas are manifestly passive\u2014no power or activity is\nperceived in them.\n\n\n (2) But because of the mind-dependent status of ideas, they cannot\nhave any characteristics which they are not perceived to have.\n\n Therefore,\n\n (3) Ideas are passive, that is, they possess no causal\npower.\n\n\n It should be noted that premise (2) is rather strong; Phillip Cummins\n(1990) identifies it as Berkeley\u2019s \u201cmanifest qualities\nthesis\u201d and argues that it commits Berkeley to the view that\nideas are radically and completely dependent on perceivers in the way\nthat sensations of pleasure and pain are typically taken to\n be.[13]\n\n The second option is eliminated with the observation that although I\nclearly can cause some ideas at will (e.g. ideas of imagination),\nsensory ideas are involuntary; they present themselves whether I wish\nto perceive them or not and I cannot control their content. The hidden\nassumption here is that any causing the mind does must be done by\nwilling and such willing must be accessible to consciousness.\nBerkeley is hardly alone in presupposing this model of the mental;\nDescartes, for example, makes a similar set of assumptions. \n\n This leaves us, then, with the third option: my sensory ideas must be\ncaused by some other spirit. Berkeley thinks that when we consider the\nstunning complexity and systematicity of our sensory ideas, we must\nconclude that the spirit in question is wise and benevolent beyond\nmeasure, that, in short, he is God.\n3.2 Replies to objections\n\n With the basic ingredients of Berkeley\u2019s ontology in place, we can\nbegin to consider how his system works by seeing how he responds to a\nnumber of intuitively compelling objections to it. Berkeley himself\nsees very well how necessary this is: Much of the Principles\nis structured as a series of objections and replies, and in the\nThree Dialogues, once Philonous has rendered Hylas a\nreluctant convert to idealism, he devotes the rest of the book to\nconvincing him that this is a philosophy which coheres well with\ncommon sense, at least better than materialism ever did.\n3.2.1 Real things vs. imaginary ones\n\n Perhaps the most obvious objection to idealism is that it makes real\nthings no different from imaginary ones\u2014both seem fleeting\nfigments of our own minds, rather than the solid objects of the\nmaterialists. Berkeley replies that the distinction between real\nthings and chimeras retains its full force on his view. One way of\nmaking the distinction is suggested by his argument for the existence\nof God, examined above: Ideas which depend on our own finite human\nwills are not (constituents of) real things. Not being voluntary is\nthus a necessary condition for being a real thing, but it is clearly\nnot sufficient, since hallucinations and dreams do not depend on our\nwills, but are nevertheless not real. Berkeley notes that the ideas\nthat constitute real things exhibit a steadiness, vivacity, and\ndistinctness that chimerical ideas do not. The most crucial feature\nthat he points to, however, is order.  The ideas imprinted by\nthe author of nature as part of rerum natura occur in regular\npatterns, according to the laws of nature (\u201cthe set rules or\nestablished methods, wherein the mind we depend on excites in us the\nideas of sense, are called the Laws of Nature\u201d PHK 30). They are\nthus regular and coherent, that is, they constitute a coherent real\nworld.\n3.2.2 Hidden structures and internal mechanisms\n\n The related notions of regularity and of the laws of nature are\ncentral to the workability of Berkeley\u2019s idealism. They allow him to\nrespond to the following objection, put forward in PHK 60:\n\n \u2026it will be demanded to what purpose serves that curious\norganization of plants, and the admirable mechanism in the parts of\nanimals; might not vegetables grow, and shoot forth leaves and\nblossoms, and animals perform all their motions, as well without as\nwith all that variety of internal parts so elegantly contrived and put\ntogether, which being ideas have nothing powerful or operative in\nthem, nor have any necessary connexion with the effects ascribed to\nthem?  [\u2026] And how comes it to pass, that whenever there is any\nfault in the going of a watch, there is some corresponding disorder to\nbe found in the movements, which being mended by a skilful hand, all\nis right again? The like may be said of all the clockwork of Nature,\ngreat part whereof is so wonderfully fine and subtle, as scarce to be\ndiscerned by the best microscope. In short, it will be asked, how upon\nour principles any tolerable account can be given, or any final cause\nassigned of an innumerable multitude of bodies and machines framed\nwith the most exquisite art, which in the common philosophy have very\napposite uses assigned them, and serve to explain abundance of\nphenomena.\n \n\n Berkeley\u2019s answer, for which he is indebted to\n Malebranche,[14]\n is that, although God could make a watch run (that is, produce in us\nideas of a watch running) without the watch having any internal\nmechanism (that is, without it being the case that, were we to open\nthe watch, we would have ideas of an internal mechanism), he cannot do\nso if he is to act in accordance with the laws of nature, which he has\nestablished for our benefit, to make the world regular and\npredictable. Thus, whenever we have ideas of a working watch, we will\nfind that if we open\n it,[15]\n we will see (have ideas of) an appropriate internal\nmechanism. Likewise, when we have ideas of a living tulip, we will\nfind that if we pull it apart, we will observe the usual internal\nstructure of such plants, with the same transport tissues,\nreproductive parts, etc.\n3.2.3 Scientific explanation\n\n Implicit in the answer above is Berkeley\u2019s insightful account of\nscientific explanation and the aims of science. A bit of background is\nneeded here to see why this issue posed a special challenge for\nBerkeley. One traditional understanding of science, derived from\nAristotle, held that it aims at identifying the causes of\nthings. Modern natural philosophers such as Descartes narrowed\nscience\u2019s domain to efficient causes and thus held that\nscience should reveal the efficient causes of natural things,\nprocesses, and\n events.[16] \n Berkeley considers this as the source of an objection at Principles\n51:\n\n Seventhly, it will upon this be demanded whether it does not seem\nabsurd to take away natural causes, and ascribe every thing to the\nimmediate operation of spirits? We must no longer say upon these\nprinciples that fire heats, or water cools, but that a spirit heats,\nand so forth. Would not a man be deservedly laughed at, who should\ntalk after this manner? I answer, he would so; in such things we ought\nto think with the learned, and speak with the vulgar.\n\n On Berkeley\u2019s account, the true cause of any phenomenon is a\nspirit, and most often it is the same spirit, namely, God. \n\n But surely, one might object, it is a step backwards to abandon our\nscientific theories and simply note that God causes what happens in\nthe physical world!  Berkeley\u2019s first response here, that we should\nthink with the learned but speak with the vulgar, advises us to\ncontinue to say that fire heats, that the heart pumps blood, etc.\nWhat makes this advice legitimate is that he can reconstrue such talk\nas being about regularities in our ideas. In Berkeley\u2019s view, the\npoint of scientific inquiry is to reveal such regularities:\n\n If therefore we consider the difference there is betwixt natural\nphilosophers and other men, with regard to their knowledge of the\nphenomena, we shall find it consists, not in an exacter\nknowledge of the efficient cause that produces them, for that can be\nno other than the will of a spirit, but only in a greater\nlargeness of comprehension, whereby analogies, harmonies, and\nagreements are discovered in the works of Nature, and the particular\neffects explained, that is, reduced to general rules, see\nSect. 62, which rules grounded on the analogy, and\nuniformness observed in the production of natural effects, are most\nagreeable, and sought after by the mind; for that they extend our\nprospect beyond what is present, and near to us, and enable us to make\nvery probable conjectures, touching things that may have happened at\nvery great distances of time and place, as well as to predict things\nto come\u2026. (PHK 105)\n \n\n Natural philosophers thus consider signs, rather than causes (PHK\n108), but their results are just as useful as they would be under a\nmaterialist system. Moreover, the regularities they discover provide\nthe sort of explanation proper to science, by rendering the particular\nevents they subsume unsurprising (PHK 104). The sort of explanation\nproper to science, then, is not causal explanation, but reduction to\n regularity.[17]\n3.2.4 Unperceived objects\u2014Principles vs. Dialogues\n\n Regularity provides a foundation for one of Berkeley\u2019s responses\nto the objection summarized in the famous limerick:\n\n There was a young man who said God, \n must think it exceedingly odd \n if he finds that the tree \n continues to be\n when no one\u2019s about in the\n Quad.[18]\n\n\n The worry, of course, is that if to be is to be perceived (for\nnon-spirits), then there are no trees in the Quad at 3 a.m. when no\none is there to perceive them and there is no furniture in my office\nwhen I leave and close the door. Interestingly, in the\nPrinciples Berkeley seems relatively unperturbed by this\nnatural objection to idealism. He claims that there is no problem\nfor\n\n \u2026anyone that shall attend to what is meant by the term\nexist when applied to sensible things. The table I write\non, I say, exists, that is, I see and feel it; and if I were out of my\nstudy I should say it existed, meaning thereby that if I was in my\nstudy I might perceive it, or that some other spirit actually does\nperceive it. (PHK 3)\n \n\n So, when I say that my desk still exists after I leave my office,\nperhaps I just mean that I would perceive it if I were in my office,\nor, more broadly, that a finite mind would perceive the desk were it\nin the appropriate circumstances (in my office, with the lights on,\nwith eyes open, etc.). This is to provide a sort of counterfactual\nanalysis of the continued existence of unperceived objects. The truth\nof the counterfactuals in question is anchored in regularity: because\nGod follows set patterns in the way he causes ideas, I would have a\ndesk idea if I were in the office.\n\n Unfortunately, this analysis has counterintuitive consequences when\ncoupled with the esse est percipi doctrine (McCracken 1979,\n286). If to be is, as Berkeley insists, to be perceived, then the\nunperceived desk does not exist, despite the fact that it\nwould be perceived and thus would exist if someone\nopened the office door. Consequently, on this view the desk would not\nendure uninterrupted but would pop in and out of existence, though it\nwould do so quite predictably. One way to respond to this worry would\nbe to dismiss it\u2014what does it matter if the desk ceases to exist\nwhen unperceived, as long as it exists whenever we need it?  Berkeley\nshows signs of this sort of attitude in Principles 45\u201346, where he\ntries to argue that his materialist opponents and scholastic\npredecessors are in much the same\n boat.[19] \n This \u201cwho cares?\u201d response to the problem of continued\nexistence is fair enough as far as it goes, but it surely does\nconflict with common sense, so if Berkeley were to take this route he\nwould have to moderate his claims about his system\u2019s ability to\naccommodate everything desired by the person on the street.\n\n Another strategy, however, is suggested by Berkeley\u2019s reference in\nPHK 3 and 48 to \u201csome other spirit,\u201d a strategy\nsummarized in a further limerick:\n\n  Dear Sir, your astonishment\u2019s odd \n  I am always about in the Quad \n  And that\u2019s why the tree  \n  continues to be \n  since observed by, Yours faithfully, God\n\n\n If the other spirit in question is God, an omnipresent being, then\nperhaps his perception can be used to guarantee a completely\ncontinuous existence to every physical object. In the Three\nDialogues, Berkeley very clearly invokes God in this\ncontext. Interestingly, whereas in the Principles, as we have\nseen above, he argued that God must exist in order to cause\nour ideas of sense, in the Dialogues (212, 214\u20135) he argues\nthat our ideas must exist in God when not perceived by\n us.[20]\n  If our ideas exist in God, then they presumably exist\ncontinuously. Indeed, they must exist continuously, since standard\nChristian doctrine dictates that God is unchanging. \n\n Although this solves one problem for Berkeley, it creates several\nmore. The first is that Berkeley\u2019s other commitments, religious and\nphilosophical, dictate that God cannot literally have our ideas. Our\nideas are sensory ideas and God is a being who \u201ccan suffer\nnothing, nor be affected with any painful sensation, or indeed any\nsensation at all\u201d (3D 206). Nor can our sensory ideas be copies\nof God\u2019s nonsensory ones (McCracken 1979):\n\n How can that which is sensible be like that which is insensible?  Can\na real thing in itself invisible be like a colour;\nor a real thing which is not audible, be like a\nsound? (3D 206)\n \n\n A second problem is that God\u2019s ideas are eternal, whereas physical\nobjects typically have finite duration. And, even worse, God has ideas\nof all possible objects (Pitcher 1977, 171\u20132), not just the ones which\nwe would commonsensically wish to say exist.\n\n  A solution (proposed by McCracken) to these related problems is to\ntie the continued existence of ordinary objects to God\u2019s will, rather\nthan to his understanding. McCracken\u2019s suggestion is that unperceived\nobjects continue to exist as God\u2019s decrees. Such an account in terms\nof divine decrees or volitions looks promising: The tree continues to\nexist when unperceived just in case God has an appropriate volition or\nintention to cause a tree-idea in finite perceivers under the right\ncircumstances.  Furthermore, this solution has important textual\nsupport: In the Three Dialogues, Hylas challenges Philonous\nto account for the creation, given that all existence is\nmind-dependent, in his view, but everything must exist eternally in\nthe mind of God. Philonous responds as follows:\n\n May we not understand it [the creation] to have been entirely in\nrespect of finite spirits; so that things, with regard to us, may\nproperly be said to begin their existence, or be created, when God\ndecreed they should become perceptible to intelligent creatures, in\nthat order and manner which he then established, and we now call the\nlaws of Nature? You may call this a relative, or\nhypothetical existence if you please. (3D 253)\n \n\n Here Berkeley ties the actual existence of created physical beings to\nGod\u2019s decrees, that is, to his will.\n\n  As with the counterfactual analysis of continued existence, however,\nthis account also fails under pressure from the esse est\npercipi principle:\n\n Hylas.  Yes, Philonous, I grant the existence of a sensible thing consists\nin being perceivable, but not in being actually perceived.\n\n\n Philonous.  And what is perceivable but an idea? And can an\nidea exist without being actually perceived?  These are points\nlong since agreed between us. (3D 234)\n \n\n\n Thus, if the only grounds of continued existence are\nvolitions in God\u2019s mind, rather than perceived items (ideas),\nthen ordinary objects do not exist continuously, but rather pop in and\nout of existence in a lawful fashion.\n\n Fortunately, Kenneth Winkler has put forward an interpretation which\ngoes a great distance towards resolving this difficulty. In effect, he\nproposes that we amend the \u201cvolitional\u201d interpretation of\nthe existence of objects with the hypothesis that Berkeley held\n\u201cthe denial of blind agency\u201d (Winkler 1989, 207\u2013224). This\nprinciple, which can be found in many authors of the period (including\nLocke), dictates that any volition must have an idea behind it, that\nis, must have a cognitive component that gives content to the\nvolition, which would otherwise be empty or \u201cblind\u201d. While\nthe principle is never explicitly invoked or argued for by Berkeley,\nin a number of passages he does note the interdependence of will and\nunderstanding. Winkler plausibly suggests that Berkeley may have found\nthis principle so obvious as to need no arguing. With it in place, we\nhave a guarantee that anything willed by God, e.g. that finite\nperceivers in appropriate circumstances should have elm tree ideas,\nalso has a divine idea associated with it. Furthermore, we have a neat\nexplanation of Berkeley\u2019s above-noted leap in the Dialogues\nfrom the claim that God must cause our ideas to the claim that our\nideas must exist in God. \n\n Of course, it remains true that God cannot have ideas that are,\nstrictly speaking, the same as ours. This problem is closely related\nto another that confronts Berkeley: Can two people ever perceive the\nsame thing?  Common sense demands that two students can perceive the\nsame tree, but Berkeley\u2019s metaphysics seems to dictate that they never\ntruly perceive the same thing, since they each have their own\nnumerically distinct ideas. One way to dissolve this difficulty is to\nrecall that objects are bundles of ideas.  Although two people cannot\nperceive/have the numerically same idea, they can perceive the same\nobject, assuming that perceiving a component of the bundle suffices\nfor perception of the\n bundle.[21]\n  Another proposal (Baxter 1991) is to invoke Berkeley\u2019s doctrine that\n\u201csame\u201d has both a philosophical and a vulgar sense (3D\n247) in order to declare that my tree-idea and your tree-idea are\nstrictly distinct but loosely (vulgarly) the same. Either account\nmight be applied in order to show either that God and I may perceive\nthe same object, or that God and I may perceive, loosely speaking, the\nsame thing. \n\n From this discussion we may draw a criterion for the actual existence\nof ordinary objects, one which summarizes Berkeley\u2019s considered\nviews:\n\n An X exists at time t if and only if God has an\nidea that corresponds to a volition that if a finite mind at\nt is in appropriate circumstances (e.g. in a particular\nplace, looking in the right direction, or looking through a\nmicroscope), then it will have an idea that we would be disposed to\ncall a perception of an X. \n\n\n\nThis captures the idea that\nexistence depends on God\u2019s perceptions, but only on the perceptions\nwhich correspond to or are included in his volitions about what\nwe should perceive. It also captures the fact that the\nbundling of ideas into objects is done by\n us.[22]\n3.2.5 The possibility of error\n\n A further worry about Berkeley\u2019s system arises from the\nidea-bundle account of\n objects.[23] \n If there is no mind-independent object against which to measure my\nideas, but rather my ideas help to constitute the object, then how can\nmy ideas ever fail\u2014how is error possible?  Here is another way\nto raise the worry that I have in mind: We saw above that\nBerkeley\u2019s arguments against commonsense realism in the first\nDialogue attempt to undermine (1) claims that heat, odor,\ntaste are distinguishable from pleasure/pain and (2) the claim that\nobjects have one true color, one true shape, one true taste, etc.  If\nwe then consider what this implies about Berkeleyian objects, we must\nconclude that Berkeley\u2019s cherry is red, purple, gray, tart, sweet,\nsmall, large, pleasant, and painful!  It seems that Berkeley\u2019s desire\nto refute the mechanist representationalism which dictates that\nobjects are utterly unlike our experience of them has lead\nhim to push beyond common sense to the view that objects are\nexactly like our experience of\n them.[24] \n There is no denying that Berkeley is out of sync with common sense\nhere. He does, however, have an account of error, as he shows us in\nthe Dialogues:\n\n Hylas. What say you to this? Since, according to you, men judge of\nthe reality of things by their senses, how can a man be mistaken in\nthinking the moon a plain lucid surface, about a foot in diameter; or a\nsquare tower, seen at a distance, round; or an oar, with one end in the\nwater, crooked?\n\n\n Philonous. He is not mistaken with regard to the ideas he actually\nperceives; but in the inferences he makes from his present perceptions.\nThus in the case of the oar, what he immediately perceives by sight is\ncertainly crooked; and so far he is in the right. But if he thence\nconclude, that upon taking the oar out of the water he shall perceive\nthe same crookedness; or that it would affect his touch, as crooked\nthings are wont to do: in that he is mistaken. (3D 238)\n\n\n Extrapolating from this, we may say that my gray idea of the cherry,\nformed in dim light, is not in itself wrong and forms a part of the\nbundle-object just as much as your red idea, formed in daylight.\nHowever, if I judge that the cherry would look gray in bright light,\nI\u2019m in error. Furthermore, following Berkeley\u2019s directive to speak\nwith the vulgar, I ought not to say (in ordinary circumstances) that\n\u201cthe cherry is gray,\u201d since that will be taken to imply\nthat the cherry would look gray to humans in daylight.\n3.2.6 Spirits and causation\n\n We have spent some time examining the difficulties Berkeley faces in\nthe \u201cidea/ordinary object\u201d half of his ontology.\nArguably, however, less tractable difficulties confront him in the\nrealm of spirits. Early on, Berkeley attempts to forestall materialist\nskeptics who object that we have no idea of spirit by arguing for this\nposition himself:\n\n A spirit is one simple, undivided, active being: as it perceives\nideas, it is called the understanding, and as it produces or\notherwise operates about them, it is called the will. Hence\nthere can be no idea formed of a soul or spirit: for all ideas\nwhatever, being passive and inert, vide Sect. 25, they cannot\nrepresent unto us, by way of image or likeness, that which acts. A\nlittle attention will make it plain to any one, that to have an idea\nwhich shall be like that active principle of motion and change of\nideas, is absolutely impossible. Such is the nature of spirit or that\nwhich acts, that it cannot be of it self perceived, but only by the\neffects which it produceth. (PHK 27)\n \n\n Surely the materialist will be tempted to complain, however, that\nBerkeley\u2019s unperceivable spiritual substances, lurking behind the\nscenes and supporting that which we can perceive, sound a lot like the\nmaterial substances which he so emphatically rejects. \n\n Two very different responses are available to Berkeley on this issue,\neach of which he seems to have made at a different point in his\nphilosophical development. One response would be to reject spiritual\nsubstance just as he rejected material substance.  Spirits, then,\nmight be understood in a Humean way, as bundles of ideas and\nvolitions. Fascinatingly, something like this view is considered by\nBerkeley in his early philosophical notebooks (see PC 577ff). Why he\nabandons it is an interesting and difficult\n question;[25]\n it seems that one worry he has is how the understanding and the will\nare to be integrated and rendered one thing. \n\n The second response would be to explain why spiritual substances are\nbetter posits than material ones. To this end, Berkeley emphasizes\nthat we have a notion of spirit, which is just to say that we know\nwhat the word means. This purportedly contrasts with\n\u201cmatter,\u201d which Berkeley thinks has no determinate\ncontent. Of course, the real question is: How does the term\n\u201cspirit\u201d come by any content, given that we have no idea\nof it?  In the Principles, Berkeley declares only that we\nknow spirit through our own case and that the content we assign to\n\u201cspirit\u201d is derived from the content each of us assigns to\n\u201cI\u201d (PHK 139\u2013140). In the Dialogues, however,\nBerkeley shows a better appreciation of the force of the problem that\nconfronts him:\n\n [Hylas.]  You say your own soul supplies you with some sort of\nan idea or image of God. But at the same time you acknowledge you have,\nproperly speaking, no idea of your own soul. You even affirm that\nspirits are a sort of beings altogether different from ideas.\nConsequently that no idea can be like a spirit. We have therefore no\nidea of any spirit. You admit nevertheless that there is spiritual\nsubstance, although you have no idea of it; while you deny there can be\nsuch a thing as material substance, because you have no notion or idea\nof it. Is this fair dealing? To act consistently, you must either admit\nmatter or reject spirit. (3D 232)\n \n\n To the main point of Hylas\u2019 attack, Philonous replies that each of us\nhas, in our own case, an immediate intuition of ourselves, that is, we\nknow our own minds through reflection (3D 231\u2013233).  Berkeley\u2019s\nconsidered position, that we gain access to ourselves as thinking\nthings through conscious awareness, is surely an intuitive\none. Nevertheless, it is disappointing that he never gave an explicit\nresponse to the Humean challenge he entertained in his notebooks:\n\n + \u00a0 Mind is a congeries of Perceptions. Take away Perceptions\n& you take away the Mind put the Perceptions & you put the\nmind.  (PC 580)\n \n\n A closely related problem which confronts Berkeley is how to make\nsense of the causal powers that he ascribes to spirits. Here again,\nthe notebooks suggest a surprisingly Humean view:\n\n+ \u00a0 The simple idea call\u2019d Power seems obscure or rather none at all. but\nonely the relation \u2018twixt cause & Effect. Wn I ask whether A can\nmove B. if A be an intelligent thing. I mean no more than whether the\nvolition of A that B move be attended with the motion of B, if A be\nsenseless whether the impulse of A against B be follow\u2019d by ye motion\nof B. \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \n 461[26]\n\nS \u00a0 What means Cause as distinguish\u2019d from Occasion? nothing but a Being\nwch wills wn the Effect follows the volition. Those things that happen\nfrom without we are not the Cause of therefore there is some other\nCause of them i.e., there is a being that wills these perceptions in\nus. \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 499\n\nS \u00a0 There is a difference betwixt Power & Volition. There may be\nvolition without Power. But there can be no Power without Volition.\nPower implyeth volition & at the same time a Connotation of the\nEffects following the Volition. \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0  699\n\n\n 461 suggests the Humean view that a cause is whatever is\n (regularly)[27]\n followed by an effect. 499 and 699 revise this doctrine by requiring\nthat a cause not only (regularly) precede an effect but also be a\nvolition. Berkeley\u2019s talk of occasion here reveals the immediate\ninfluence of Malebranche.  Malebranche held that the only true cause\nis God and that apparent finite causes are only \u201coccasional\ncauses,\u201d which is to say that they provide occasions for God to\nact on his general volitional policies. Occasional\n\u201ccauses\u201d thus regularly precede their\n\u201ceffects\u201d but are not truly responsible for producing\nthem. In these notebook entries, however, Berkeley seems to be\nsuggesting that all there is to causality is this regular consequence,\nwith the first item being a volition. Such an account, unlike\nMalebranche\u2019s, would make my will and God\u2019s will causes in exactly the\nsame thin sense.\n\n Some commentators, most notably Winkler, suppose that Berkeley\nretains this view of causality in the published works. The main\ndifficulty with this interpretation is that Berkeley more than once\npurports to inspect our idea of body, and the sensory qualities\nincluded therein, and to conclude from that inspection that bodies are\npassive (DM 22, PHK 25). This procedure would make little sense if\nbodies, according to Berkeley, fail to be causes by definition, simply\nbecause they are not minds with\n wills.[28] \n What is needed is an explanation of what Berkeley means by\nactivity, which he clearly equates with causal power. Winkler (1989,\n130\u20131) supplies such an account, according to which activity means\ndirection towards an end. But this is to identify efficient causation\nwith final causation, a controversial move at best which Berkeley\nwould be making without comment or argument. \n\n The alternative would be to suppose, as De Motu 33 suggests,\nthat Berkeley holds that we gain a notion of activity, along with a\nnotion of spirit as substance, through reflective awareness/internal\nconsciousness:\n\n [W]e feel it [mind] as a faculty of altering both our own state and\nthat of other things, and that is properly called vital, and puts a\nwide distinction between soul and bodies. (DM 33)\n \n\n  On this interpretation, Berkeley would again have abandoned the\nradical Humean position entertained in his notebooks, as he clearly\ndid on the question of the nature of spirit. One can only speculate as\nto whether his reasons would have been primarily philosophical,\ntheological, or practical. Berkeley\u2019s writings, however, are not\ngenerally characterized by deference to authority, quite the\n contrary,[29]\n as he himself proclaims: \n\n\n\u2026 one thing, I know, I am not guilty of. I do not pin my\nfaith on the sleeve of any great man. I act not out of prejudice\n& prepossession. I do not adhere to any opinion because it is\nan old one, a receiv\u2019d one, a fashionable one, or one that I have spent\nmuch time in the study and cultivation of. (PC 465)\n \n",
