    "main_text": "The PD with Replicas and Causal Decision Theory\n7. The PD with Replicas and Causal Decision Theory\n\nOne controversial argument that it is rational to cooperate in a PD\nrelies on the observation that my partner in crime is likely to think\nand act very much like I do. (See, for example, Davis 1977 and 1985\nfor a sympathetic presentation of one such argument and Binmore 1994,\nchapters 3.4 and 3.5, for a reformulation and extended rebuttal.) In\nthe extreme case, my accomplice is an exact replica of me who\nis wired just as I am so that, of necessity, we do the same thing. It\nwould then seem that the only two possible outcomes are where both\nplayers cooperate and where both players defect. Since the reward\npayoff exceeds the punishment payoff, I should cooperate. More\ngenerally, even if my accomplice is not a perfect replica, the odds of\nhis cooperating are greater if I cooperate and the odds of his\ndefecting are greater if I defect. When the correlation between our\nbehaviors is sufficiently strong or the differences in payoffs is\nsufficiently great, my expected payoff (as that term is\nusually understood) is higher if I cooperate than if I defect. The\ncounter argument, of course, is that my action is causally\nindependent of my replica's. Since I can't affect what my\naccomplice does and since, whatever he does, my payoff is greater if I\ndefect, I should defect. These arguments closely resemble the\narguments for two positions on the Newcomb Problem, a puzzle\npopularized among philosophers in Nozick. (The extent of the\nresemblance is made apparent in Lewis.) The Newcomb Problem asks us to\nconsider two boxes, one transparent and one opaque. In the transparent\nbox we can see a thousand dollars. The opaque box may contain either a\nmillion dollars or nothing. We have two choices: take the contents of\nthe opaque box or take the contents of both boxes. We know before\nchoosing that a reliable predictor of our behavior has put a million\ndollars in the opaque box if he predicted we would take the first\nchoice and left it empty if he predicted we would take the second. To\nsee that each player in a PD faces a Newcomb problem, consider the\nfollowing payoff matrix.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\\(\\bC\\)\n\\(\\bD\\) \n\n\\(\\bC\\)\n\\(m,m\\)\n\\(0,m+t\\) \n\n\\(\\bD\\)\n\\(m+t,0\\)\n\\(t,t\\)  \n\n\nBy \u201ccooperating\u201d (choosing the opaque box), each player\nensures that the other gets a million dollars (and a thousand extra\nfor defecting). By \u201cdefecting\u201d (choosing both boxes) each\nplayer ensures that he will get thousand dollars himself (and a\nmillion more if the other cooperates). As long as \\(m \\gt t \\gt 0\\),\nthe structure of this game is an ordinary two-player, two-move PD (and\nany such PD can be represented in this form). Furthermore, the\narguments for \u201cone-boxing\u201d and \u201ctwo-boxing\u201d in\na Newcomb problem are the same as the arguments for cooperating and\ndefecting in a prisoner's dilemma where there is positive correlation\nbetween the moves of the players. Two boxing is a dominant\nstrategy: two boxes are better than one whether the first one is full\nor empty. On the other hand, if the predictor is reliable, the\nexpected payoff for one-boxing is greater than the expected\npayoff for two-boxing. (See Hurley (1991) and Berm\u00fadez (2015),\nhowever, for arguments that the two puzzles are significantly\ndifferent.)\n\nThe intuition that two-boxing is the rational choice in a Newcomb\nproblem, or that defection is the rational choice in the PD with\npositive correlation between the players' moves, seems to conflict\nwith the idea that rationality requires maximizing expectation. This\napparent conflict has led some to suggest that standard decision\ntheory needs to be refined in cases in which an agent's actions\nprovide evidence for, without causing, the context\nin which he is acting. In the case of the PD, standard (evidential)\ndecision theory asks Player One to compare his expected utilities of\ncooperation and defection, which can be written as \\(p(\\bC_2 \\mid\n\\bC_1) \\times R + p(\\bD_2 \\mid \\bC_1) \\times S\\) and \\(p(\\bC_2 \\mid\n\\bD_1) \\times T + p(\\bD_2 \\mid \\bD_1) \\times P\\) (where, for example,\n\\(p(\\bC_2 \\mid \\bC_1)\\) is the conditional probability that player Two\ncooperates given that Player One cooperates). If the players' moves\nare strongly correlated then \\(p(\\bC_2 \\mid \\bC_1)\\) and \\(p(\\bD_2\n\\mid \\bD_1)\\) will be close to one and \\(p(\\bC_2 \\mid \\bD_1)\\) and\n\\(p(\\bD_2 \\mid \\bC_1)\\) will be close to zero. On the suggested\nrevision, these conditional probabilities should be replaced by some\nkind of causally conditional probabilities, which might (on some\naccounts) be expressed by phrases like \u201cthe probability that if\nOne were to cooperate, Two would also cooperate.\u201d When the moves\nare causality independent this would just be the probability that Two\ncooperates.\n\nThe rather far-fetched scenario described in Newcomb's Problem\ninitially led some to doubt the importance of the distinction between\ncausal and evidential decision theory. Lewis argues that the link to\nthe PD suggests that situations where the two decisions diverge are\nnot so unusual, and recent writings on causal decision theory contain\nmany examples far less bizarre than Newcomb's problem. (See Joyce, for\nexample.)\n\nIn recent years technical machinery from the epistemic foundations of\ngame theory literature and various logics of conditionals has been\nemployed to represent arguments for cooperation and defection in\nprisoner's dilemma games between replicas (and for one-boxing and\ntwo-boxing in the Newcomb problem). See Bonanno for one example and a\ndiscussion of several others. These representations make clear some\nsubtle assumptions about the nature of rationality that underly the\narguments. Despite the increasing sophistication of the discussion,\nhowever, there remain people committed to each view.\n\nIt might be noted that what is here called \u201cPD between\nreplicas\u201d is usually called \u201cPD with twins\u201d in the\nliterature. One reason for the present nomenclature is to distinguish\nthese ideas from an experimental literature reporting on PD games\nplayed with real (identical or fraternal) twins. (See, for example,\nSegal and Hershberger.) It turns out that twins are more\nlikely to cooperate in a PD than strangers, but there seems to be no\nsuggestion that the reasoning that leads them to do so follows the\ncontroversial arguments presented above.\n",
