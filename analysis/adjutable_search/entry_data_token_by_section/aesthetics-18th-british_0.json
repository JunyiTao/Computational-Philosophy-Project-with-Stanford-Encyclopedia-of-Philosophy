    "main_text": "Internal-Sense Theories || Shaftesbury\n1.1 Shaftesbury\n\nShaftesbury takes up aesthetic questions from time to time across his\nCharacteristics of Men, Manners, Opinions, Times\n(first published in 1711), particularly within its third, fourth, and\nfifth Treatises. But it is perhaps only within this last\ntreatise\u2014the dialogue The Moralists, a Philosophical\nRhapsody\u2014that he can be said to develop a theory of taste.\nNear the beginning of the dialogue\u2019s climactic section (Section\nII of Book III) Shaftesbury\u2019s spokesman, Theocles, issues a pair\nof imperatives: one ought \u201cnever to admire the\nRepresentative-Beauty, except for the sake of the\nOriginal; nor aim at other Enjoyment than of the\nrational kind\u201d (Cooper 1711 [2001, 221]). It is largely\nin the subsequent explication of these imperatives that\nShaftesbury\u2019s highly influential theory of taste emerges.\n\nShaftesbury does not intend the force of these imperatives to be\nnegative merely. He clearly thinks that one ought to admire the\noriginal beauty referred to in the first imperative; indeed he later\nidentifies it with the beauty of the divine mind. Moreover, the\nadmiration of beauty referred to in the first imperative just is the\nenjoyment of the rational kind referred to in the second. Hence the\ntwo imperatives, reversing their order, might be paraphrased as\nfollows: one ought to seek the enjoyment of beauty as opposed to the\nrival enjoyments that one might mistake for the enjoyment of beauty;\nand the enjoyment of beauty that one ought to seek ought always to be\nfor the sake of the original as opposed to the sake of the\nrepresentative merely. To say that the rival enjoyments that one might\ntake for the enjoyment of beauty are not \u201cof the\nrational kind\u201d is to say that they are merely sensory\nor bodily in nature. Such non-rational enjoyments, moreover, are\n\u201cinterested\u201d in the sense that they depend on the thought\nof, and beget a desire for, the use or possession of their objects.\nTheocles illustrates this point with a series of examples culminating\nin that of sexual pleasure taken at the sight of a human body.\n\u201cI \u2026 was apprehensive,\u201d says his interlocutor,\nPhilocles, that\n\nyou wou\u2019d force me at last to think of certain powerful FORMS in\nhuman Kind, which draw after \u2019em a Set of eager\nDesires, Wishes, and Hopes; no way\nsuitable, I must confess, to your rational and refin\u2019d\nContemplation of Beauty. The Proportions of this living\nArchitecture, as wonderful as they are, inspire nothing of a\nstudious or contemplative kind. The more they are\nview\u2019d , the further they are from satisfying by mere View.\n(Cooper 1711 [2001, 222])\n\n\nAn example surfacing a bit later serves both to reinforce the\ndistinction between such non-rational enjoyments and the rational\nenjoyment of beauty and to introduce the distinction between the\nadmiration of representative beauty for its own sake and that for the\nsake of the original. Enjoyment taken in the sight of a coin is\nenjoyment taken in its beauty only if it arises not from any thought\nof what the coin may buy, but merely from the contemplation of the\ndesign or form of the coin\u2019s inscription. Whether in addition\nthis is admiration of the coin\u2019s representative beauty for the\nsake of the original depends on whether one recognizes the\nrepresentative nature of the coin\u2019s beauty. Because the coin is\nbeautiful in virtue of its design or form, it is beautiful not in\nvirtue of its material properties but in virtue of the effect that\nsome mind has had upon it. But if the coin is beautiful in virtue of\nthe effect of some mind upon it, this can only be because that mind is\nitself beautiful, the beauty of the coin being representative merely\nof the original beauty of that mind. Hence to admire the beauty of the\ncoin (or the beauty of any material object) without acknowledging that\nits beauty merely shadows the beauty of the mind that designed it is\nto fail to admire representative beauty for the sake of the original\n(Cooper 1711 [2001, 225\u2013226]).\n\nBut there is a complication. If the mind that formed the coin is a\nhuman mind, then, while its beauty is original relative to the coin,\nit is representative relative to the beauty of the mind that formed\nit. Hence there are \u201cThree Degrees or Orders of\nBeauty\u201d:\n\nfirst, the dead Forms \u2026 which bear a Fashion, and are\nform\u2019d, whether by Man, or Nature; but have no forming Power, no\nAction, or Intelligence \u2026 the second kind, the Forms which\nform; that is, which have Intelligence, Action, and Operation\n\u2026 [and] that third Order of Beauty, which forms not\nonly such as we call mere Forms, but even the Forms which\nform. (Cooper 1711 [2001, 227\u2013228])\n\n\nHence all beauty ultimately \u201cresolves it-self\u201d (Cooper\n1711 [2001, 228]) into the beauty of the divine mind:\n\nwhatever Beauty appears in our second Order of Forms, or\nwhatever is deriv\u2019d or produc\u2019d from thence, all this is\neminently, principally, and originally in this last Order of\nSupreme and Sovereign Beauty. (Cooper 1711 [2001,\n228])\n\n\nThus admiring the representative beauty of the coin for the sake of\nthe original requires tracing its beauty not merely to the mind that\ndesigned it, but also to the mind that designed that mind.\n\nA consequence of the view that the divine mind is the source of all\nbeauty is that beauty is not relative to human nature merely, but is\nabsolute and real. Indeed, given Shaftesbury\u2019s pantheistic\nleanings, things turn out, on his view, to be beautiful quite\nliterally from the point of view of the universe. A further\nconsequence is that beauty, inhering only in mind or in its\nreflection, cannot be grasped by any bodily sense, but only by the\nmind itself:\n\nthere is nothing so divine as BEAUTY: which belonging not to\nBody, nor having any Principle or Existence except in MIND\nand REASON, is alone discover\u2019d and acquir\u2019d by this\ndiviner Part, when it inspects it-self, the only object worthy of\nit-self. (Cooper 1711 [2001, 238])\n\n\nBut Shaftesbury does not rest with the claim that it is the mind that\ngrasps beauty: he adds the claim that it is by a \u201cmental\u201d\nor \u201cinward\u201d sense that the mind does so. Though it is\ndifficult to know just what Shaftesbury takes this claim to come to,\nthe general idea is that the faculty by which the mind discerns beauty\nhas enough in common with external sense to warrant the term\n\u201csense\u201d and to be regarded as no less natural (or basic)\nthan external sense. In The Moralists he observes that the\ndiscernment of beauty has the immediacy of external sensation and so\nmust be regarded as natural as external sensation. No sooner is an\nobject of the right kind placed before the mind\n\nthan straight an inward EYE distinguishes, and sees the\nFair and Shapely, the Amiable and\nAdmirable, apart from the Deform\u2019d, the\nFoul, the Odious, or the Despicable. How is\nit possible therefore not to own \u201cThat these\nDistinctions have their Foundation in Nature, the\nDiscernment it-self is natural, and from Nature\nalone?\u201d (Cooper 1711 [2001, 231])\n\n\nAnd, in a famous passage from An Inquiry concerning Virtue and\nMerit (Treatise IV), Shaftesbury observes that the discernment of\nbeauty has the necessity or will-independence of external sensation\nand so again must be regarded as natural on a par with external\nsensation. Once an object of the right kind is placed before the mind,\na verdict as to its beauty cannot be withheld:\n\nThe Mind, which is Spectator or Auditor of other Minds,\ncannot be without its Eye and Ear; so as to discern\nProportion, distinguish Sound, and scan each Sentiment or Thought\nwhich comes before it \u2026. It \u2026 finds a Foul and\nFair, a Harmonious and a Dissonant, as\nreally and truly here, as in any musical Numbers, or in the outward\nForms or Representations of sensible Things. Nor can it with-hold its\nAdmiration and Extasy, its Aversion and\nScorn, any more in what relates to one than to the other of\nthese Subjects. So that to deny the common and natural Sense of a\nSUBLIME and BEAUTIFUL in Things, will appear an Affectation merely, to\nany-one who considers duly of this Affair. (Cooper 1711 [2001, 17])\n\n\nShaftesbury, it bears mentioning, did not originate\nthe idea that it is by an inward sense that we lay hold of\nthe sublime and the beautiful. That idea is an element\nof the neoplatonic tradition which Shaftesbury\u2019s work\nextends, and can be traced back to St. Augustine\n(2005/389\u2013391, De vera religione \u00a759)\nand Plotinus (250 [1991, 1.6.7\u20139]), if not to Plato himself (1989,\n210a-211d). \n",
