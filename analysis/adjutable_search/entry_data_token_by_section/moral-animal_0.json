    "main_text": "The Moral Considerability of Animals\n1. The Moral Considerability of Animals\n\nTo say that a being deserves moral consideration is to say that there\nis a moral claim that this being can make on those who can recognize\nsuch claims. A morally considerable being is a being who can be\nwronged. It is often thought that because only humans can recognize\nmoral claims, it is only humans who are morally considerable. However,\nwhen we ask why we think humans are the only types of beings that can\nbe morally wronged, we begin to see that the class of beings able to\nrecognize moral claims and the class of beings who can suffer moral\nwrongs are not co-extensive.\n",
