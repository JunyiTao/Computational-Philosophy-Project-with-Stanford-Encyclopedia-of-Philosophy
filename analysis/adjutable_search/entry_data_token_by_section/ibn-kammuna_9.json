    "main_text": "Philosophy: Following the Thread of Intuition || Pietistic writings (Kalim\u0101t waj\u012bza, Ithb\u0101t al-mabda\u2019)\n5.6 Pietistic writings (Kalim\u0101t waj\u012bza, Ithb\u0101t al-mabda\u2019)\n\n\nThe Arabic originals of these two intimately related treatises were\npublished for the first time by Pourjavady & Schmidtke (2006); an\nannotated translation of the Ithbat was published by\nLangermann (2017).  In these writings, Ibn Kammuna pays far less\nattention to questions of cognition than he does in his other\nwritings. However, here as elsewhere, he takes note of the abilities\nof gifted people to grasp issues that remain recalcitrant to others\nwho are not so endowed. Here again Ibn Kammuna connects this special\nmode of cognition with tajriba, repeated experience. In\naddition, he emphasizes here that the fruits of this special type of\nknowledge can be fully appreciated only by someone who has experienced\nthem. It is thus striking that he does not employ the technical\nterm h\u0323ads in the course of his exposition, or, indeed,\nanywhere at all in these two writings.\n\n\nConsider this passage from the Kalim\u0101t (Pourjavady &\nSchmidtke 2006, 158, author\u2019s translation): \u201cIf, however, a\nweakening of the bodily impediments were to be joined to the strength\nof the soul, whether this [strength] be original [asli, here\nmeaning \u2018inborn\u2019] or acquired, the way the soul is\nstrengthened by practice or the training that is associated with\n\u2018those who know\u2019 [i.e., the Sufis], then the bond is made\nfirm in such a way that the soul will attain many hidden things,\ncopious items of knowledge, and illuminative pleasures, whose true\nnature can be apprehended only by someone who has found them\nhimself.\u201d A few lines down tajriba is mentioned:\n\u201cMany wonderful things of the souls are known by means of\nrepeated experiences (tajarib), repetition, and some form of\nreasoning (qiyas).\u201d\n\nTajriba does appear in the passage just cited, but it is not\nmentioned at all in the shorter pietistic treatise, Ithb\u0101t\nal-mabda\u02be (Establishing the First Principle). On the\nother hand, Ibn Kammuna does employ in the shorter work several\ncognate terms to describe the person who can grasp a certain fact\nimmediately and without the need for lengthy demonstration: dhihn\nsalim (\u201chealthy mind,\u201d Pourjavady & Schmidtke\n2006, 188), dhu fitana (\u201cclever,\u201d Pourjavady\n& Schmidtke 2006, 189), dhu lubb\n(\u201cunderstanding,\u201d Pourjavady & Schmidtke 2006,\n189).\n\n\nThe terminological conundrum intensifies when we bring into the\ndiscussion another term, dhawq, literally \u201ctaste\u201d.\nDhawq is a Sufi term and refers to a usually fleeting, intense\nreligious experience, which leaves the adept knowing something more\nthan he knew beforehand. Viewed as a phenomenon of the human mind, it\nis essentially the same thing as intuition. It is used in exactly this\nsense by Ibn S\u012bn\u0101\u2014significantly, in the monograph on\nthe rational soul considered to be his very last\n work.[3]\nSuhraward\u012b adopted the term\nfor his version of knowledge based upon intuition, h\u0323ikma\ndhawqiyya; in Ibn Kammuna\u2019s New Wisdom, h\u0323ads and\ndhawq are synonymous (Langermann 2005, 300). Yet in the\npietistic writings, where one would expect to find the usual Sufi term,\ndhawq is not employed.\n\n\nThere is little difference between the ideas expressed in these two\ntreatises and those in the other writings. In all cases the basic\nthought is that some people are born with an innate ability to swiftly\narrive at conclusions that are certainly true. There remains the technical\ndistinction, in that h\u0323ads, and h\u0323ads specifically, is\nsaid to disclose the middle term of the syllogism. However, one should\nnot make too much of this. For one matter, even in cases\nwhere h\u0323ads is invoked, we rarely if ever can determine just\nwhat the syllogism is for which h\u0323ads has revealed the middle\nterm. One important exception is the reasoning that leads to the\nmomentous conclusions drawn from the \u201cFlying Man\u201d\nexperiment (see Muehlethaler 2009). Moreover, whether or\nnot h\u0323ads is specifically mentioned, intuition or spontaneous\ncomprehension is paired to tajriba.\n\n\nThe chronology of Ibn Kammuna\u2019s writings will not solve the problem\neither. The Kalimat seems to have been written well after Ibn\nKammuna had already been exposed to the writings of Ibn Sina and\nSuhrawardi, both of whom make much of h\u0323ads, as we have seen\n(Pourjavady & Schmidtke 2006, 8\u201312). We are thus confronted here\nwith the historiographical and methodological question of the weight\nto be given to technical terms as opposed to ideas, a question that\nthe present writer opts to leave open.\n",
