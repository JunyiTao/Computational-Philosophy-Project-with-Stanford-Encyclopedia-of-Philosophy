    "main_text": "Humean Supervenience\n5. Humean Supervenience\n\nAlmost-Lewis\u2019s theses about what fundamental ontology comprises,\nand how all other facts reduce to facts about it, bears a very close\nrelationship to Lewis\u2019s celebrated thesis of Humean Supervenience\n(hereafter: \u201cHS\u201d). But they are not the same, and the\ndifferences are worth keeping track of. Here is a typical statement of\nHS (slightly stronger, as we\u2019ll see, than the version Lewis\nofficially endorses): No two possible worlds differ with respect to\nwhat is true at them, without differing with respect to the\ngeometrical arrangement of their spacetime points, or with respect to\nwhich perfectly natural properties are instantiated at those\n points.[6]\n (Note that so stated, HS is automatically metaphysically\nnecessary.) Thus, HS is a supervenience claim,\nlogically weaker than Almost-Lewis\u2019s claim of reduction. It is\nalso a claim that\u2014for some good reasons and some bad\nreasons\u2014Lewis accepts only in a weaker form that is\nmetaphysically contingent. More significantly, it is no part\nof HS that facts about possible worlds themselves reduce to\nanything else; whereas both Almost-Lewis and Lewis are explicit in\ntheir commitment to this further claim. Having said all this, it will\nbe worth remembering in what follows that Almost-Lewis\u2019s position\n(which, remember, incorporates Lewis\u2019s modal realism)\nentails HS. So, any doubts about HS will carry over to\nAlmost-Lewis\u2019s fundamental ontology.\n",
