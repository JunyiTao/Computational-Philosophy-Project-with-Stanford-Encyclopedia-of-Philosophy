It is not\ntrue that no proper part of a dog is dog. All the 101 (and more)\nproper parts of Oscar differing from him and from one another by a\nhair are dogs. In fact, many (though of course not all) identity\npreserving changes Oscar might undergo correspond directly to proper\nparts of (an unchanged) Oscar. But there is no problem about barking\nin unison, and no problem about acting independently. All 101 are the\nsame dog, despite their differences, just as young Oscar and old Oscar\nare the same dog. The relativist denies that the dogs are many rather\nthan deny that the many are dogs (Lewis 1993).\n",
