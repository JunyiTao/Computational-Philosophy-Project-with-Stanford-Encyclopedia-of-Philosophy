    "main_text": "Medical Doctrines || Health and Disease\n3.1 Health and Disease\n\nFragment 4 presents Alcmaeon\u2019s account of health and\ndisease:\n\nAlcmaeon said that the equality (isonomia) of the powers\n(wet, dry, cold, hot, bitter, sweet, etc.) maintains health but that\nmonarchy among them produces disease.\n\n\nThis is, in fact, not a fragment but a testimonium and much of the\nlanguage comes from the doxographical tradition rather than Alcmaeon.\nThe report goes on to say that Alcmaeon thought that disease arose\nbecause of an excess of heat or cold, which in turn arose because of\nan excess or deficiency in nutrition. Disease is said to arise in the\nblood, the marrow, or the brain. It can also be caused by external\nfactors such as the water, the locality, toil, or violence. The idea\nthat health depends on a balance of opposed factors in the body is a\ncommonplace in Greek medical writers. Although Alcmaeon is the\nearliest figure to whom such a conception of health is attributed, it\nmay well be that he is not presenting an original thesis but rather\ndrawing on the earlier medical tradition in Croton. Perhaps what is\ndistinctive to Alcmaeon is the use of the specific political metaphor\nand most scholars (e.g., Sassi 2007, 198; Jouanna 1999, 327;\nKouloumentas 2014, 871) agree that the political terminology\n(isonomia, monarchia) goes back to him. Indeed,\nthese terms are not found elsewhere in the Greek medical\ntradition. Just as Anaximander explained the order of the cosmos in\nterms of justice in the city-state, so Alcmaeon used a political\nmetaphor to explain the order of the human body. It is commonly\nrecognized that isonomia (equality) is not a specific form of\ngovernment but rather a concept of political equality in terms of\nwhich forms of government are evaluated (Ostwald 1969, 108; Meier\n1990, 162 calls it a \u201cyardstick\u201d, Vlastos 1981,\n173\u201374 a \u201cbanner\u201d). Its primary application is to\ndemocracies (Herodotus III.80) but it is also applied to moderate\noligarchies that have democratic features (Thucydides III.\n62.3\u20134). Although a significant number of scholars argue that\nthere is a purely aristocratic application for isonomia as\nthe equality of aristocratic peers in opposition to a tyrant (e.g.,\nRaaflaub 2004: 95; Zhmud 2012a: 358), one of the most noted early\nadherents of this view later abandoned it (Ehrenberg 1956: 67) and it\nappears more likely that the term  isonomia originated with\nthe radical democracy which emerged in Athens in the late sixth\ncentury and was only applied in a secondary sense to moderate\noligarchies (Vlastos 1973, 175\u20137; Ostwald 1969, 99\u2013106).\nIs Alcmaeon\u2019s use of the term simply descriptive of the equality\nof powers that is necessary for the healthy body, or does his use of\nthe term to describe health suggest that he was in sympathy with\nradical democracy (Vlastos 1953, 363)? We simply have no direct\nevidence for Alcmaeon\u2019s political views. However, Aristotle\nemphasizes that Alcmaeon posited an indefinite number of opposites as\nactive in the human body in contrast to the Pythagoreans who specified\nten pairs (see 4.2 below), which suggests that Alcmaeon\u2019s\n\u201cbody\u201d politic was not an oligarchy with a numerically\ndefined group of peers but rather a democracy which gave equality to\nthe full range of opposites. Mansfeld has recently argued that\nscholars are wrong to ascribe the key terms  isonomia and\nmonarchia to Alcmaeon (Mansfeld 2014a). Such a metaphorical\nuse of isonomia is unparalleled at this early date and is\nmuch more likely to have been introduced later in the doxographical\ntradition. Moreover, monarchia may have been introduced by a\ndoxographer familiar with its use in the famous debate on\nconstitutions in Herodotus (III 80\u20133), where isonomia\nalso appears (III 80). Mansfeld concludes that this origin of the\nterms from the doxography is more likely than assuming influence on\nAlcmaeon from the reforms of Cleisthenes. The difficulty with\nMansfeld\u2019s approach is that the striking thing about the report\non Alcmaeon is precisely the political metaphor and it seems more\nplausible that his views were introduced into the doxography because\nof that metaphor than that his views were typical Greek views on\ndisease and the metaphor only arose as an artefact of the\ndoxographical tradition. If he did introduce the political metaphor\nthen it is as probable as not that he used the terms ascribed to him,\nespecially since both appear only a little later in Herodotus,\nalthough not with a metaphorical sense. \n3.2 Sleep, Embryology, and the Use of Analogy\n\nAlcmaeon is the first to raise a series of questions in human and\nanimal physiology that later become stock problems, which every\nthinker tries to address. He thus sets the initial agenda for Greek\nphysiology (Longrigg 1993, 54\u20137; Lloyd 1966, 322 ff.). He said\nthat sleep is produced by the withdrawal of the blood away from the\nsurface of the body to the larger (\u201cblood-flowing\u201d)\nvessels and that we awake when the blood diffuses throughout the body\nagain (DK, A18). Death occurs when the blood withdraws entirely.\nHippocratic writers (Epid. VI 5.15) and Aristotle\n(H.A. 521a15) both seem to have adopted Alcmaeon\u2019s\naccount of sleep. It is very unlikely, however, that Alcmaeon\ndistinguished between veins (the \u201cblood-flowing vessels\u201d)\nand arteries, as some have claimed. It is more likely that he simply\ndistinguished between larger more interior blood vessels as opposed to\nsmaller ones close to the surface (Lloyd 1991, 177). He probably\nargued that human seed was drawn from the brain (DK, A13). It has\nrecently been suggested (K\u00f6nig 2019), however, that he instead\nthought 1) that sperm came from the whole body, 2) that the brain was\nits transit port and 3) that it was ultimately a product of\ndigestion. But no ancient source directly assigns any of these\ndoctrines to Alcmaeon and the arguments in favor of them are very\nindirect. Contrary to a popular Greek view, which regarded the father\nalone as providing seed, a view that would be followed by Aristotle\n(Lloyd 1983, 86 ff.), Alcmaeon may have argued that both parents\ncontribute seed (DK, A13) and that the child takes the sex of the\nparent who contributes the most seed (DK, A14). It has recently been\nsuggested, however, that our sole source for these views (Censorinus)\nis mistaken and that, while Alcmaeon thought that both the male and\nfemale contributed to the child, only the male contributed seed\n(Leitao 2012: 278\u201379), the female contributing menses. According\nto one report, Alcmaeon thought that the head was the first part of\nthe embryo to develop, although another report has him confessing that\nhe did not have definite knowledge in this area, because no one is\nable to perceive what is formed first in the infant (DK, A13). These\nreports are not inconsistent and conform to the epistemology with\nwhich Alcmaeon began his book. It is plausible to suppose that he\nregarded the development of the embryo as one of the imperceptibles\nabout which we can have no certain knowledge. On the other hand, he\nmay have regarded it as a reasonable inference that the part of the\nbody which controls it in life, i.e., the brain, developed first in\nthe womb. Dissection is of obvious relevance to the debate about the\ndevelopment of the embryo, and Alcmaeon\u2019s failure to appeal to\ndissection of animals in this case is further evidence that he did not\nemploy it as a regular method (Lloyd 1979, 163). Alcmaeon studied not\njust humans but also animals and plants. He gave an explanation of the\nsterility of mules (DK, B3) and, if we can believe Aristotle, thought\nthat goats breathed through their ears (DK, A7). More significantly,\nhe used analogies with animals and plants in developing his accounts\nof human physiology. Thus, the pubic hair that develops when human\nmales are about to produce seed for the first time at age fourteen is\nanalogous to the flowering of plants before they produce seed (DK,\nA15); milk in mammals is analogous to egg white in birds (DK,\nA16). The infant in the womb absorbs nutrients through its entire\nbody, like a sponge, although another report suggests that the embryo\nalready feeds through its mouth (DK, A17). However, the text of the\nlatter report should perhaps be amended from stomati [mouth]\nto\ns\u00f4mati [body], thus removing the contradiction\n(Olivieri 1919, 34). Analogies such as these will become a staple item\nin later Greek biological treatises, but Alcmaeon is one of the\nearliest figures in this tradition.\n\n4. Cosmology\n4.1 Astronomy\n\nAs indicated in section 1 above, there is considerable controversy as\nto whether and to what extent Alcmaeon was a typical Presocratic\ncosmologist. Certainly the evidence for his cosmology is meager. There\nare three references to his astronomical theory (DK, A4). He is\nreported to have recognized that the planets have a motion from west\nto east opposite to the motion of the fixed stars. Some doubt that\nsuch knowledge was available at the beginning of the fifth century\n(Dicks 1970, 75). Others suggest that Anaximenes, in the second half\nof the sixth century, had already distinguished between the fixed\nstars, which are nailed to the ice-like vault of the sky, and planets\nwhich float on the air like leaves (DK13A7; Burkert 1972, 311).\nAlcmaeon\u2019s belief that the sun is flat is another possible\nconnection to Anaximenes, who said that the sun was flat like a leaf\n(DK13A15). Finally, another similarity to Ionian astronomy is found in\nAlcmaeon\u2019s agreement with Heraclitus that lunar eclipses were to\nbe explained by the turning of a bowl-shaped moon. One might have\nexpected, however, that the moon would be flat like the sun (West\n1971, 175).\n4.2 Opposites\n\nDid Alcmaeon present a cosmogony or cosmology in terms of the\ninteraction of pairs of opposites? Such a cosmology could be seen as\nyet another connection to earlier speculation in Ionia, since\nAnaximander\u2019s cosmos is based on the \u201cjustice\u201d\nestablished between conflicting opposites (DK12B1). Heraclitus is also\na possible influence on Alcmaeon, since he seems to envisage an\nendless process of opposites turning into one another such as is\nproposed for Alcmaeon (Mansfeld 2014a, 91\u20132). Aristotle provides\nthe primary evidence for such a cosmology in Alcmaeon\n(Metaph. 986a22 ff. = A3), but he compares Alcmaeon not to\nthe Ionians but to a group of Pythagoreans who proposed a table of ten\npairs of opposites. Alcmaeon agrees with these Pythagoreans in\nregarding the opposites as principles of things. Aristotle complains,\nhowever, that Alcmaeon did not arrive at a definite set of opposites\nbut spoke haphazardly of white, black, sweet, bitter, good, bad,\nlarge, and small, and only threw in vague comments about the remaining\nopposites. It may well be that Alcmaeon\u2019s primary discussion of\nopposites was in relation to his account of the human body (DK, B4;\nsee the discussion of his medical theories above). Aristotle\u2019s\nlanguage supports this suggestion to some extent, when he summarizes\nAlcmaeon\u2019s view as that \u201cthe majority of human\nthings (t\u00f4n anthr\u00f4pin\u00f4n) are in\npairs\u201d (Metaph. 986a31). Isocrates (DK, A3) says that\nAlcmaeon, in contrast to Empedocles, who postulated four elements,\nsaid that there were only two, and, according to a heterodox view,\nAlcmaeon posited fire and earth as basic elements (Lebedev 1993). Most\nscholars follow Aristotle, however, in supposing that Alcmaeon thought\nthat the human body and perhaps the cosmos is constituted from the\nbalance of an indefinite number of opposites. Some have seen\nAlcmaeon\u2019s unwillingness to adopt a fixed set of opposites as a\nvirtue and a further sign of his empiricism, which is willing to\naccept that the world is less tidy than theoretical constructs, such\nas the Pythagorean table of opposites, would suggest (Guthrie 1962,\n346).\n5. Importance and Influence\n\nAlcmaeon has been somewhat neglected in recent scholarship on early\nGreek philosophy (e.g., he hardly appears in Curd and Graham 2008,\nLong 1999 and Taylor 1997, the most recent surveys of the subject, but\nboth Guthrie 1962 and now Zhmud 2012a and 2014 stress his importance).\nThere would appear to be several reasons for this neglect. First, what\nremains of Alcmaeon\u2019s book has little to say on the metaphysical\nquestions about the first principles of the cosmos and about being,\nwhich have dominated recent scholarship on the Presocratics. Second,\ndoubts about his date and about the focus of his investigations have\nmade it difficult to place him in the development of early Greek\nthought. Finally, a more accurate appreciation of his use of\ndissection has deflated some of the hyperbolic claims in earlier\nscholarship about his originality. The extent of his originality and\nthe importance of his influence depend to a degree on his dating. An\nextremely late dating for his activity (after 450 BCE) makes him\nappear to espouse the typical views of the age rather than to break\nnew ground. If he was active in the early fifth century, his views are\nmuch more original. That Aristotle wrote a separate treatise in\nresponse to Alcmaeon argues in favor of his originality. He should\nprobably be regarded as a pioneer in applying a political metaphor to\nthe balance of opposites that constitute the healthy human body. The\nrange of his work in biology is remarkable for the early fifth century\nand he may have initiated a physiological emphasis in Greek philosophy\nwhich was not present in Ionian philosophers, such as Anaximander and\nAnaximenes, and set the agenda in this area for later Presocratics\n(Zhmud 2012a, 366). It is sometimes said that his conception of\nporoi (channels), which connect the sense organs to the\nbrain, influenced Empedocles\u2019 theory of poroi, but the\ntheories may share no more than the name. In Empedocles, all materials\nhave pores in them, which determine whether they mix well with other\nobjects. Sense organs also have pores, but these function not to\nconnect the sense organ to the seat of intelligence (which for\nEmpedocles is the heart) but to determine whether the sense organ can\nreceive the effluences that are poured forth by external objects\n(Solmsen 1961, 157; Wright 1981, 230). Alcmaeon\u2019s influence was\nsignificant in three final ways: 1) His identification of the brain as\nthe seat of human intelligence influenced Philolaus (DK, B13), the\nHippocratic Treatise, On the Sacred Disease, and Plato\n(Timaeus 44d), although a number of thinkers including\nEmpedocles and Aristotle continued to regard the heart as the seat of\nperception and intelligence. 2) His empiricist epistemology may lie\nbehind important passages in Plato (Phaedo 96b) and Aristotle\n(Posterior Analytics 100a). 3) He developed the first\nargument for the immortality of the soul, which may have influenced\nPlato\u2019s argument in the Phaedrus (245c ff.).",
