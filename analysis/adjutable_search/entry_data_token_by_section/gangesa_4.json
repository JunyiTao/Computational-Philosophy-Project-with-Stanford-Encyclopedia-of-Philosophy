    "main_text": "Knowledge and certification || How knowledge is known\n3.2 How knowledge is known\n\nIt is difficult to appreciate Ga\u1e45ge\u015ba\u2019s reflection on\ncertification without knowing something about the\nM\u012bm\u0101\u1e43saka positions, called in general\n\u201cself-certification,\u201d which he attacks. Self-certification\nis embraced also by Yog\u0101c\u0101ra Buddhist philosophers, but\nGa\u1e45ge\u015ba focuses mainly on the arguments of\nPr\u0101bh\u0101karas as voiced in particular by the ninth-century\nauthor \u015a\u0101likan\u0101tha (1961). It seems that\nM\u012bm\u0101\u1e43sakas would secure the authority of Vedic\ntestimony for rituals and various rules of everyday life effortlessly,\none suspects in overview, by maintaining that knowledge is\nself-certifying. Ga\u1e45ge\u015ba focuses, however, on perceptual\nknowledge, which, he maintains, can, in certain circumstances, both be\ndoubted and later certified as knowledge. \u201cI wouldn\u2019t now\nbe drinking water, if the awareness had not been knowledge. But I am\nnow drinking, satisfying my thirst, and the awareness was knowledge\nindeed\u201d (translator\u2019s comments, Jewel 2020: 109).\nIn this case, the certification comes by way of an inference. Source\nidentification is another way of capturing the point. It is by\ninference that one determines that an awareness-generating process is\nindeeed perception, perception that is factively conceived. A genuine\nsource never misleads. Only \u201cpseudo-sources\u201d do.\n\nThere are different signs whereby one knows that an instance of\ninferential knowledge is both true and produced in the right way. Do\nwe really know the premises, in particular the alleged\n\u201cpervasion,\u201d vy\u0101pti? For testimony,\ncertification conditions are the speaker\u2019s being a trustworthy\nexpert along with conditions governing what it is to be a proper\nstatement and of course certain hearer conditions (such as knowing the\nlanguage). And in certain cases there is, admittedly,\nself-certification. But the M\u012bm\u0101\u1e43sakas are wrong to\ntake that to be the general rule.\n",
