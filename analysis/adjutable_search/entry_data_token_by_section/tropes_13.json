    "main_text": "Trope Applications || Tropes in Science\n4.5 Tropes in Science\n\nDiscussions of what use can be made of tropes in science can be found\nscattered in the literature. Examples include Rom Harr\u00e9\u2019s\n(2009) discussion of the role tropes play (and don\u2019t play) in\nchemistry, and Bence Nanay\u2019s (2010) attempt to use tropes to\nimprove on Ernst Mayr\u2019s population thinking in biology. Most\ndiscussions have however been focused on the relationship between\ntropes and physics (Kuhlmann et al. 2002). Most influential in this\nrespect is Campbell\u2019s field-theory of tropes (defended in his\n1990: Ch. 6; cf. also Von Wachter 2000) and Simons\u2019\n\u2018nuclear\u2019 theory of tropes and the scientific use he\ntentatively makes of it (Simons 1994; cf. also Morganti 2009\nand Wayne 2008).\n\nAccording to Campbell, the world is constituted by a rather limited\nnumber of field tropes which, according to our (current) best science,\nought to be identified with the fields of gravitation,\nelectromagnetism, and the weak and strong nuclear forces (plus a\nspacetime field). Standardly, these forces are understood as exerted\nby bodies that are not themselves fields. Not so on Campbell\u2019s\nview. Instead, matter is thought of as spread out and as present in\nvarious strengths across a region without any sharp boundaries to its\nlocation. What parts of the mass field we choose to focus on will be\nto a certain degree arbitrary. A zone in which several fields all\nsharply increase their intensity will likely be taken as one single\nentity or particle. But given the overall framework, individuals of\nthis kind are to be viewed as \u201cwell-founded appearances\u201d\n(Campbell 1990: 151).\n\nCampbell\u2019s views have been criticized by e.g., Christina\nSchneider (2006). According to Schneider, the field ontology proposed\nby Campbell (and by Von Wachter) fails, because the notion of a field\nwith which they seem to be working, is not mathematically\n rigorous.[35]\n And Matteo Morganti who, just like Campbell, wants to identify tropes\nwith entities described by quantum physics, finds several problems\nwith the identifications actually made by Campbell. He proposes\ninstead that we follow Simons and identify the basic constituents of\nreality with the fundamental particles, understood as bundles of\ntropes (Morganti 2009). If we take the basic properties described by\nthe Standard Model as fundamental tropes, is the idea, then the\nconstitution of particles out of more elementary constituents can be\nreadily reconstructed (possibly by using the sheaf-theoretical\nframework proposed by Mormann 1995, or the algebraic framework\nsuggested by Fuhrmann 1991).\n",
