    "main_text": "The Argument for Cartesian Skepticism Employing the Closure Principle || Consideration of CP2\n3.2 Consideration of CP2\n\nCP2 claims that we are not justified in denying the skeptical\nhypothesis\u2014in other words, that we are not justified in\nbelieving that we are not being deceived. What arguments can be given\nfor CP2? It is tempting to suggest something like this: The skeptical\nscenarios are developed in such a way that it is assumed that we\ncould not tell that we were being deceived. For example, we\nare asked to consider that there is an Evil Genius \u201cso\npowerful\u201d that it could (1) make me believe that there were\nhands when there were none and (2) make it such that I could\nnot detect the illusion. But the skeptic must be very careful here.\nShe cannot require that in order for S to know (or be justified\nin believing) something, say x, that if x were false,\nshe would not still believe x. We have just seen (while\nexamining Nozick\u2019s account of knowledge) that this requirement\nis arguably too strong. So the mere fact that there could be skeptical\nscenarios in which S still believes that she is not in such a\nscenario cannot provide the skeptic with a basis for thinking that she\nfails to know that she is not (actually) in a skeptical scenario. But\neven more importantly, were that a requirement of knowledge (or\njustification), then we have seen that closure would fail and,\nconsequently, the basis for the first premise in the CP-style argument\nfor Cartesian Skepticism would be\n forfeited.[12]\n\n\nErnest Sosa has argued for three interrelated theses regarding CP2 and\nNozick\u2019s sensitivity condition: (i) that sensitivity can be\neasily confused with a different condition on knowledge (which Sosa\ncalls safety); (ii) that while sensitivity is not a correct necessary\ncondition on knowledge, safety is; (iii) finally, that our belief in\nthe negation of skeptical hypotheses is safe despite being\n insensitive.[13]\n\nNozick\u2019s sensitivity condition is a subjunctive\nconditional: if p were false, S would not believe\nit. The usual way in which such conditionals are evaluated is by\nassuming that there is an ordering of possible worlds\naccording to how much they resemble the actual world. A subjunctive\nconditional \\(A \\rightarrow B\\) is true if and only if B is\ntrue in the closest (or all the closest) possible worlds where\nA is true. According to this semantics, subjunctive\nconditionals do not contrapose (the contrapositive of a conditional\nif A, B is if not-B, not-A). Thus, suppose that we\nflip a coin to decide whether you or I will strike this match: heads\nyou strike it, tails I do. The coin comes up head, you strike the\nmatch and it lights. In this situation, it is true that if I had\nstruck the match, it would have lit. But it doesn\u2019t seem to be\ntrue that if the match hadn\u2019t lit then I wouldn\u2019t have\nstruck it. The match might have failed to lit because it was wet while\neither of us struck it. In the possible worlds terminology, the\nclosest possible world where I strike the match is a world where it\nlights, but there are possible worlds where the match doesn\u2019t\nlight and I strike it that are as close to actuality as are worlds\nwhere the match doesn\u2019t light and you strike it.\n\nAfter noticing the failure of subjunctives to contrapose, Sosa\nproposed that we should replace Nozick\u2019s sensitivity condition\nwith its contrapositive, which Sosa calls a \u2018safety\u2019\ncondition. The following formulation seems to capture Sosa\u2019s\nintent:\n\n\nSafety: S\u2019s belief that p based\non e is safe if and only if S would not easily believe\nthat p based on e without it being so that p (in\nsymbols, S believes that p on basis \\(e \\rightarrow p\\)).\n(Sosa\n 2002)[14]\n\n\nNow, one initial worry about safety as a condition on knowledge is\nthat, given that belief and truth are also necessary for knowledge,\nsafety will always be (in this context) a true-true conditional (that\nis to say, both its antecedent and consequent will be true). This\nmeans that Sosa cannot accept the possible worlds semantics for\nsubjunctive conditionals briefly sketched above, at least if we assume\nthat every world is closer to itself than any other word. For when we\nhave a true-true conditional, the closest world where the antecedent\nis true will be the actual world, and so every such conditional will\nbe true (and, hence, any condition formulated by such conditionals\nwill be trivially\n satisfied).[15]\n Rather, Sosa understands the truth-conditions for the relevant\nconditions as requiring that the consequent be true in all nearby\npossible worlds where the antecedent is true.\n\nSosa\u2019s idea, then, is that we can explain away the temptation to\nthink that CP2 is true by noticing that although safety and\nsensitivity are easily confused with one another, my belief that I am\nnot the victim of a skeptical scenario is insensitive but safe, and\nthat whereas sensitivity is not a condition on knowledge, safety\nis.\n\nBut is safety a condition on knowledge? Several authors have thought\nthat, just as there are counterexamples to sensitivity, there are\ncounterexamples to safety as well. Here is one (taken from\nComesa\u00f1a 2005b):\n\n\nHalloween Party: There is a Halloween party at\nAndy\u2019s house, and I am invited. Andy\u2019s house is very\ndifficult to find, so he hires Judy to stand at a crossroads and\ndirect people towards the house (Judy\u2019s job is to tell people\nthat the party is at the house down the left road). Unbeknownst to me,\nAndy doesn\u2019t want Michael to go to the party, so he also tells\nJudy that if she sees Michael she should tell him the same thing she\ntells everybody else (that the party is at the house down the left\nroad), but she should immediately phone Andy so that the party can be\nmoved to Adam\u2019s house, which is down the right road. I seriously\nconsider disguising myself as Michael, but at the last moment I\ndon\u2019t. When I get to the crossroads, I ask Judy where the party\nis, and she tells me that it is down the left road.\n\n\nThat case is a counterexample to safety insofar as we agree that I\nknow that the party is at the house down the left road, and yet it\ncould very easily have happened that I have that same belief on the\nsame basis without it being so that the belief was true.\n\nSo far, we have argued that there are dangers in defending CP2 by\nappealing to the sensitivity condition, and that Sosa\u2019s attack\non CP2 might itself be subject to doubt. What else can be said for or\nagainst CP2?\n\nLet\u2019s go back to the rough idea that there is some kind of\nepistemic symmetry between what we take to be the actual case and a\nskeptical scenario. Of course, if we were the victims in a skeptical\nscenario, we wouldn\u2019t know that we are not (if only because it\nwould be false, but perhaps not only because of that). Given symmetry,\neven if we are not victims of a skeptical scenario, we do not know\nthat we are not. Moreover, we know all of this. As we suggested in\nsection 1, if we know that we don\u2019t know that p, then we\nare not even justified in believing that p. Therefore, CP2.\nEvery step in this argument can be challenged, but there is no doubt\nthat many philosophers find something along these lines at least worth\nthinking about. Let us take a closer look at the first step, the claim\nthat there is an epistemic symmetry between the good case and the\nskeptical scenario.\n\nWhat can this alleged symmetry amount to? One idea is that we have the\nsame evidence in both cases. According to a Cartesian account of this\ncommon evidence, it consists in mental states of the subject, such as\nher experiences. By construction, the subject has the same experiences\nin the skeptical scenario as she does in the good case. But some\nphilosophers, most notably Williamson 2000, have denied that we have\nthe same evidence in the good and the skeptical case. According to\nWilliamson, our evidence is constituted not by our experiences, but by\nwhat we know. Given that in the good case we know more propositions\nthat in the bad case, we have more evidence in the good case than we\ndo in the skeptical case. In the good case, for instance, we know\nmundane propositions such as the proposition that we have hands. Given\nthat knowledge entails justification, in the good case we are\njustified in believing that we have hands. Given CP, in the good case\nwe are justified in believing that we are not in the skeptical case.\nThis account of evidence entails that the relation of\nindiscriminability between the good case and the skeptical case is not\nsymmetric: victims of a skeptical scenario cannot distinguish the\nskeptical scenario from the good case (for all they know, they are in\nthe good case, and for all they know, they are in the skeptical case),\nbut subjects in the good case can distinguish between the cases (they\nknow that they are in the good case, and\u2014again, given\nCP\u2014they know that they are not in the skeptical\n case).[16]\n\nBut even those contemporary philosophers who grant that our epistemic\nposition with respect to external world propositions is the same in\nthe normal case as in the skeptical scenario can object to the\nsymmetry thesis. For even granting (as we must) that in the skeptical\nscenario we do not know that we are not in the skeptical scenario, it\ndoesn\u2019t follow that in the ordinary case we do not know that we\nare not in the skeptical scenario, not even assuming that we have the\nsame evidence in both cases. To begin with, an obvious difference\nbetween the normal case and the skeptical scenario is that in the\nskeptical scenario the proposition in question (that we are not in the\nskeptical scenario) is false, whereas in the normal case it is true.\nGiven that knowledge requires truth, we can explain why we lack\nknowledge in the skeptical scenario by appealing to this truth\ncondition on knowledge, rather than to the paucity of our evidence. In\nother words, our evidence for thinking that we are not in the\nskeptical scenario, this reply holds, is good enough to know that\nproposition, if only it were true. Now, the skeptic can then reply\nthat not all skeptical scenarios are such that external worlds\npropositions are false in them. For instance, if I am right now\ndreaming that I have hands I do not thereby know that I have hands,\neven though I do have hands while dreaming. We noted above that the\nintroduction of skeptical hypotheses which do not entail the falsity\nof external world propositions complicates the CP argument, but let us\nhere bracket that issue. For, in addition to truth, knowledge\nplausibly requires other non-evidential conditions. In the wake of the\nGettier problem, for instance, many philosophers have accepted that\nbesides belief, justification and truth, the right kind of relation\nbetween the truth of the proposition and the belief must hold, and\narguably it is this that fails in the dreaming scenario, rather than\n(again) the paucity of our evidence (see entry on\n the analysis of knowledge).\n Therefore, it can be held that there is an asymmetry between the good\ncase and the skeptical scenario even if we grant that we have the same\nevidence in both cases.\n\nThe Cartesian skeptic can nevertheless raise an uncomfortable question\nat this point: what is this alleged evidence in favor of the\nproposition that we are not in a skeptical scenario? One tempting\nanswer is that the evidence in question consists precisely of those\nexternal world propositions which are the target of the Cartesian\nargument. I know that I have hands, and, according to this view, that\nvery proposition is my evidence for the proposition that I am not a\nhandless brain in a vat. But recall our discussion of Dretske\u2019s\nmule case. There we pointed out that Dretske is, in effect,\nassimilating Closure and Transmission principles\u2014i.e., assuming\nthat the only way in which Closure principles can hold is if some\nevidence e is evidence both for p and any q\nentailed by p. We noted then that there is at least another\npossibility: it might be that we must be antecedently justified in\nbelieving q in order to be justified in believing some p\nwhich entails it. And indeed, it seems plausible that this is the\ndirection of the evidential relation between external world\npropositions and the negation of skeptical hypotheses: we cannot be\njustified in believing external world propositions unless we have\nantecedent justification for believing the negation of skeptical\nhypotheses (but cf. Pryor 2000).\n\nAnother alternative is to say that no evidence justifies us in\nbelieving the negations of skeptical hypotheses, but that we are\nnevertheless justified in believing them. On one version of this view,\nput forward by Crispin Wright 2004, our entitlement to\naccept that we are not in a skeptical scenario does not\ndepend on our having any kind of evidence, either empirical or a\npriori (see also Coliva (2015) for a development of a view in\nthis neighborhood). Indeed, we are entitled to accept those\npropositions because unless we were we would not be justified in\nbelieving any proposition. Notice two important\nterminological points in the statement of Wright\u2019s view: he\ndoesn\u2019t think that we are justified in believing that we are not\nin a skeptical scenario, but that we are entitled to accept that\nproposition. What are the differences between justification and\nentitlement, on the one hand, and belief and acceptance, on the other?\nRoughly, what we are calling justification Wright calls\n\u201cwarrant\u201d. He thinks that there are two kinds of warrant:\nwe can be warranted in believing a proposition because we have an\nevidential justification for it (where the evidence consists of the\npropositions we are warranted in believing or accepting), or we can be\nentitled to accept it even in the absence of any justification for\nthem. As for the difference between belief and acceptance, Wright is\nprepared to grant that to count as a belief an attitude must be\nevidence-based, and so entitlements cannot be entitlements to believe.\nTo be entitled to accept a proposition, for Wright, is to be justified\nin behaving (where \u201cbehavior\u201d is understood broadly, to\ninclude cognitive inferential behavior, for instance) approximately as\none would if one believed the proposition.\n\nOn another version of the view, although we do not have empirical\nevidence for the proposition that we are not in a skeptical scenario,\nwe do have a kind of justification for it which does not rest\nexclusively on the fact that if we didn\u2019t then we wouldn\u2019t\nbe justified in believing anything. Stewart Cohen 2010 has argued that\nour justification for believing that we are not in a skeptical\nscenario derives from the rationality of certain inferential rules\n(see also Wedgwood 2013). One such rule justifies us in concluding\n(defeasibly) that there is something red in front of us if we have an\nexperience with the content that there is something red in front of\nus. Now, we can use that rule \u201conline\u201d, when we do in fact\nhave an experience with the content that there is something red in\nfront of us, or \u201coffline\u201d, assuming for the sake of\nargument that we have an experience with the content that there is\nsomething red in front of us to see what follows from it. According to\nthe rule in question, it follows (again, defeasibly) that there is\nsomething red in front of us. We can now cancel the assumption by\nconcluding (defeasibly) with the following conditional: if I have an\nexperience with the content that there is something red in front of\nme, then there is something red in front of me. Notice that this\nconditional is incompatible with one specific skeptical hypothesis:\nthe hypothesis that (for whatever reason) I have an experience with\nthe content that there is something red in front of me but there is\nnothing red in front of me.\n",
