    "main_text": "Logic, Language, and States of Affairs\n8. Logic, Language, and States of Affairs\n\nStumpf did not publish any specific work on the topic of logic and\nwrote only a few pieces on language. These are however two topics in\nwhich Stumpf was very much interested. The topic of language was\ncentral in his 1876 paper on Anton Marty\u2019s dissertation entitled\n\u00dcber den Ursprung der Sprache (A. Marty, 1875; L.\nCesalli, 2015). Also worth mentioning is an essay on the psychology of\nmusic in England (1885) and his book Die Anf\u00e4nge der\nMusik (1911) in which he discussed, in relation to Spencer and\nDarwin, the thesis of the linguistic origin of music. Finally he made\na significant contribution to the field of phonology and conducted an\nextensive research on the nature of vowels and linguistic sounds, and\nthis led to the publication of his book Die Sprachlaute\n(1926) in which he experimentally confirms Helmholtz\u2019s\nprinciples on the theory of vowels. As to the domain of logic, there\nare many syllabi and extensive lecture notes, including those written\nby Husserl during his studies in Halle, which again show a direct\ninfluence from Brentano (K. Schuhmann, 1996, 1997; R. Rollinger,\n2015). We know that logic is closely related to Stumpf\u2019s theory\nof relations and eidology, which are central in both his philosophical\nand empirical works. More precisely, his contribution to logic in\nthese two research areas concerns in fact the specific content of\njudgment (belief) or what he also calls states of affairs, and that\npart of the theory of relations pertaining to part-whole relations.\nThe first leads to a theory of the states of affairs while the second\nwas useful in developing a formal ontology, one that was central in\nthe logic of his student Husserl. Finally, mention should be made of\nStumpf\u2019s publications on the relationship between logic and the\ntheory of probabilities, and his research pertaining to the\nelaboration of a theory of induction. He claimed that the application\nof probability concepts does not involve any presuppositions about the\nexternal world and the law of causality, for the calculus of\nprobability is purely a priori and is solely derived from the\nconcept of probability itself.\n\nRegarding his lectures on logic, while he accepted Brentano\u2019s\nimportant distinction between what a statement expresses and what it\nmeans, he did not subscribe to Brentano\u2019s central thesis on the\nreduction of categorical to existential statements. The meaning of a\nsentence corresponds to the content of a function, and it is distinct\nfrom the quality and matter of a predicative judgment. The quality of\nan act of judgment consists in its affirmation or negation, its\nacceptance or rejection of the matter of a judgment expressed\nlinguistically by the copula \u201cis\u201d or its negation. The\nmatter (Materie) of a judgment, which is provided by the\nlower level act of presentation, is what remains when one disregards\nthe affirmation and negation, i.e. the simple complex of presentation\n(subject and predicate minus the copula). In addition to its quality\nand matter, a judgment has a content and a state of affairs, the\nlatter roughly corresponding to what we call a proposition. Stumpf\nconceives a state of affairs both as a specific content of judgment\nand as its objective and necessary correlate, which is expressed\nlinguistically in \u201csubordinate clauses\u201d or in the form of\na \u201csubstantivized infinitive.\u201d It therefore corresponds to\nwhat Stumpf called axioms. The truth of a statement is defined as the\ncorrespondence of the judgment quality to its content, that is, the\nproperty of a judicative content by virtue of which acceptance (or its\nopposite, rejection) is prompted by purely objective motives. This\nconcept of truth is grounded in the evidence of internal perception\n(is true what is mediately or immediately self-evident), which also\nplays a central role in his theory of knowledge.\n\nThe study of the structures of the contents of judgment as such, apart\nfrom its functions and contingent states, is one of the tasks Stumpf\nassigns to this part of eidology which he calls the theory of states\nof affairs. (A. Chrudzimski, 2015) One of Stumpf\u2019s original\ncontributions to logic rests on the notion of state of affairs, which\nwas already used in the history of philosophy and especially by Lotze.\n(B. Smith, 1989, \u00a7 2) Stumpf already used this notion in his\nlectures on logic in 1888 (Q 13, p. 4), and it is now well-known that\nit has been subsequently taken over by many philosophers including\nHusserl and Wittgenstein. In 1906, Stumpf associates it with the\nconcept of formation or product (Gebilde) and applies it to\nboth intellectual and emotional functions, where in the latter case it\nis conceived as a value (also called Wertverhalt) on which\nethics and practical philosophy in general are based. These\nGebilde are objective entities that are related both to the\nconcept of objective in Meinong, to that of objectity in Husserl, and\nto Bolzano\u2019s concept of \u201cproposition in itself.\u201d\n(Stumpf, 1906b, p. 30) For this student of Lotze, the doctrine of\nGebilde is not incompatible with the Platonic theory of ideas\nthough \u201cwithout its metaphysical conclusions.\u201d (Stumpf,\n1906a, p. 33) One can certainly entertain a formation such as a state\nof affairs without having it as an actual content of judgment, but it\nis then a mere abstraction. Because, says Stumpf, \u201cthe state of\naffairs cannot be immediately given for itself independently of any\nmental function, and therefore effectively. It can only be real as the\ncontent of a judgment that is actually taking place. [\u2026] So,\nfunctions (and indeed only the conscious functions which are properly\npresent) are facts immediately known, while the Gebilde are\nfacts only regarded as contents of functions.\u201d (Stumpf, 1906a,\np. 32) Objectivism is an important issue in Stumpf\u2019s philosophy\nsince it serves as one of his main arguments against psychologism.\n\nStates of affairs are, as any other formation, governed by general and\nnecessary laws, and are independent of the individual and the\ncontingent act of judging. These structural laws or axioms as he calls\nthem in his Erkenntnislehre govern relations between\nelementary psychical formations. Stumpf distinguishes between formal\naxioms, which apply to any objects, and material or regional axioms\nwhich belong to specific domains of objects such as the domain of\nphenomenology (structural relations between phenomena) and that of\npsychology (structural relations between elementary psychical\nfunctions). Of particular interest to logic are the axioms of\nconsequence (Folgerungsaxiome), which are expressed in\npropositions and which establish a relation between the premises and\nthe conclusion in terms of necessary inference.\n",
