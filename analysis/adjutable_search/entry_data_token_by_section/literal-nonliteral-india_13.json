    "main_text": "Criticizing the Distinction || Buddhism\n4.1 Buddhism\nBuddhism and Jainism, two so-called \u201cheteroprax\u201d (Veda-rejecting) traditions in India, put forward analyses of language which challenge the notion of a distinction between primary and secondary meaning, at least as drawn in the orthoprax schools. Significant textual work\u2014as well as secondary scholarship\u2014remains to be done in the area of how both of these traditions (especially Jainism) understand language, but there are some clear themes.\nBuddhist thinkers are broadly committed to error theories about ordinary language use. As noted already, early Buddhists, in texts such as The Questions of King Milinda (Milindapa\u00f1h\u0101), argue for a kind of conventionalism: language which seems to refer to persistent whole objects, such as chariots and persons, does not, as such objects are taken to lack true existence. Later philosophical reflection, such as in the Commentary on the Treasury of Dharma (Abhidharmako\u015babh\u0101\u1e63ya) of Vasubandhu (ca fourth to fifth century CE, see the entry on Vasubandhu), presents a kind of local fictionalism or reductionism, as the only truly existing things are atomic simples which exist momentarily. Thus, all language is, save for claims about ultimately real constituent parts, loose speech. Buddhist philosophy of language is famous for its \u201ctwo truths\u201d doctrine (see the entry on the theory of two truths in India), the notion that there is conventional truth and ultimate truth\u2014but this gets deployed variously among the later schools such as Yog\u0101c\u0101ra and Madhyamaka (see Siderits 2003 and Garfield 2006).\nA commitment to the ubiquitous nature of non-literal speech is seen explicitly in Buddhist texts which pick up on the existing categories in Grammarian and Aesthetic thought, such as cognitive superimposition or metaphor (upac\u0101ra), and employ them to undermine the orthoprax theories of language which were realist and referential in nature (Gold 2007 and Tzohar 2018). For instance, the Yog\u0101c\u0101ra Buddhist Sthiramati, in his Commentary on the Thirty Verses (Tri\u1e43\u015bik\u0101bh\u0101\u1e63ya) (ca sixth century CE), cites a common Grammarian definition of upac\u0101ra, noting that use of the term \u201cself\u201d and \u201cthings\u201d is an instance of such figurative talk (Tzohar 2018). Not only is the self, when talked about in apparently ordinary ways, really being talked about indirectly, but this is so for all words which, on Sthiramati\u2019s Yog\u0101c\u0101ra view, refer to an individual\u2019s conscious experience of qualities, and not things in themselves. For Sthiramati, at least, there is a sense in which all language is \u201cmetaphorical,\u201d though grounded in the conscious arising and perishing of experiential events, rather than a (putatively) objective external reality.\nAnother way in which this conventionalism plays out is in the development of the apoha theory of concepts, which has important implications for how language functions. The term apoha means \u201cexclusion.\u201d This theory first presented in the work of fifth to sixth century CE philosopher Di\u1e45n\u0101ga (see the entry on Dharmak\u012brti, and the discussion of the theory of apoha). The theory of exclusion is meant to explain how we can have conceptual connections (linguistic or otherwise) with the world even though, on this Buddhist view, reality is ultimately a series of unique, momentarily-existing, ineffable particulars. Without universals or qualities, the Buddhists have a difficulty explaining how talk of a \u201cblue lotus,\u201d for instance, is possible. Their ingenious solution, much debated after Di\u1e45n\u0101ga, is to propose that we carve up the world conceptually by negation. Blueness is not a universal, but the exclusion of all non-blue particular things\u2014it is to be \u201cnot non-blue.\u201d How this theory works in detail is the subject of Dharmak\u012brti\u2019s work (ca sixth to seventh century CE) and a whole host of later thinkers, such as Ratnak\u012brti (ca eleventh century CE). The philosopher of aesthetics Bh\u0101maha (ca sixth to seventh century CE) criticizes apoha in his Ornaments of Poetry (K\u0101vy\u0101la\u1e45k\u0101ra), but not with regard to any distinction between primary and secondary meaning. Rather, he argues that the sense of a word is positive, and that on apoha, Buddhists are assigning two capacities to words\u2014exclusion and positive designation\u2014when there is only one (KB). M\u012bm\u0101\u1e43s\u0101 and Ny\u0101ya philosophers likewise criticize apoha extensively on these and similar grounds.\nBuddhist thought also takes up the distinction between kinds of meaning in its approach to hermeneutics, with regard to the interpretation of s\u016btra passages, not unlike the way in which Vedic hermeneutics both informs and is informed by M\u012bm\u0101\u1e43s\u0101 philosophical reflection on language. Buddhist hermeneutics, despite its being positioned \u201coutside\u201d of the orthopraxy, employs lists of figures which pre-date the rise of the textual tradition of Sanskrit poetics, in a way which demonstrates that there were links between the Grammarian, Ny\u0101ya, M\u012bm\u0101\u1e43s\u0101, and Buddhist theories of meaning (Tzohar 2018). A crucial concept in Buddhist hermeneutics, which approaches a distinction between literal and non-literal, is that of up\u0101ya or \u201cskillful means.\u201d With the assumption that the Buddha speaks both truthfully and with an eye towards the abilities of his particular audience, the notion of \u201cskillful means\u201d allows Buddhist hermeneuticists to explain apparently contradictory elements within Buddhist texts. As with Bh\u0101\u1e6d\u1e6da M\u012bm\u0101\u1e43s\u0101 use of secondary meaning for Vedic interpretation, recourse to secondary meaning in the face of apparent contradiction, skillful means allowed for truth-preservation while constraining the interpretive process.\n",
