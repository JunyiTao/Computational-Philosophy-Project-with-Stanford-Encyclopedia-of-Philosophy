    "main_text": "Mohist Views on Logic and Language || Methods of Application and Problems\n3.3 Methods of Application and Problems\n\nGiven this appeal to resemblance for valid inference, we can perhaps\nsee why the Mohists\u2019 semantical investigations took priority\nover the analysis of logical form. Determining whether x is\nG depends on whether it resembles the model m, but\nobjects can resemble one another in different ways, and imperfectly.\nTo use one of the Mohists\u2019 own examples, a man may resemble the\nchosen standard of a \u201cblack man\u201d because he has black\nhair, but we would not for that reason call him a black man. He would\nhave to resemble the standard \u201cin the appropriate way\u201d\n(yi), as determined by a criterion (yin)\n(A95\u20137). Similarly, a square piece of wood resembles a\ncarpenter\u2019s T-square (taken as a model) in virtue of its\nsquareness, not its being wood (B65). A horse is big not because its\neyes are big, but because its body is, whereas it is blind because of\nits eyes, not its body (Xiao Qu [NO18]). The Mohists\ngenerally identify these criteria by appeal to discriminations\ndirectly evident in perception or based on ideas parasitic on acts of\nperception (such as the mental image of a square). But bian\nis more than just a term for the discriminatory acts of perception; it\nis about the business of naming objects in virtue of appropriate\ndiscriminations, and the application of a name cannot be regarded as\ncorrect without an appeal to its semantic content. This is less\nevident with simple terms like \u201chorse\u201d or\n\u201csquare\u201d, whose practical applications are plain enough to\npreclude any conscious reflection on meanings. But it was surely at\nthe forefront of the Mohists\u2019 minds in their consideration of\nterms with abstract content and complex expressions, like\n\u201cbeneficence\u201d, \u201cutility\u201d, and \u201cuniversal\nlove\u201d.\n\nFor instance, a consequence of the Mohists\u2019 doctrine of\nuniversal love is that \u201cloving people\u201d (ai ren)\nrequires loving all people without exception, a criterion that is\nquantificationally different from that of \u201criding horses\u201d\n(cheng ma), which requires only that a person ride at least\none horse (Xiao Qu [NO17]). These expressions are\nsimilar grammatically, but the Mohists analyzed their quantificational\ncontent differently, something not given merely in the analysis of\nperception. So the Mohists\u2019 research program was one of\ncoordinating similarities and differences given in perception with\ndivisions determined in the analyses of the semantics of terms. The\nresult is the determination of criteria that fix the relations between\nobjects and their chosen models (cf. A97). To be sure, questions\nabound in attempting to suitably refine these criteria to apply them\nconsistently (the perceptual content of the world may be infinitely\ncomplex), but this is precisely what gave the Mohists\u2019\nphilosophical research program its impetus. (For a fascinating essay\non issues arising out of attempts at modeling in modern nomenclature\nMohist conceptions of reasoning about yi, see Liu, Seligman,\nand van Benthem 2011.) For the Mohists, such practical concerns with\nthe relations between names and objects superseded investigations into\nlogical form.\n\nOn the other hand, while the analysis of logical form might not have\nbeen the Mohists\u2019 primary theoretical concern, we should not\ntake this to imply that their philosophical pursuits did not involve\nample deductive reasoning. Lucas 2020 provides several examples of\nargumentative passages from Mohist texts that appear \u201calmost ready\nmade\u201d for formalization and which are easily regimented in a way that\ndemonstrates either their deductive validity or inductive soundness.\nIndeed, the Mohists seem to have presupposed as a paradigm of\ngood reasoning a form of inference that is purely deductive. Note that\nthe Mohists assert \u201cx is G\u201d as a\nconsequence of x\u2019s resemblance with the model\nm for G, but this only follows logically with the\naddition of a further general principle, something like\n\u201cAnything x that resembles the model m for\nG is G\u201d. This principle might not have been\nrendered explicit in their logical investigations, but their assertion\nthat x is G does not follow without its\npresupposition or something logically equivalent to it, and they did\nmake a distinguished place for quantifiers among their basic logical\nnotions. So assuming that the model for G is m, the\nMohists appear to have taken the following (or something equivalent to\nit) as a paradigmatic form of reasoning formally justifying the\napplication of names to objects:\n\n\nAnything resembling the model m for G is\nG.\n\nSomething x resembles m.\n\nTherefore, something x is G.\n\n\nThis argument is deductively valid, and it seems highly improbable\nthat the Mohists were not employing something like it in their\nassertions about the correct methodology for resolving disputes by\nbian. So, it would be highly misleading to say that the\nMohists were simply not doing logic of the kind with which we are\nfamiliar today. That they were not formalizing a theory of logical\nform does not imply that they were not engaged in rigorously defending\ntheir views on the basis of principles that involve or presuppose\nvalid deductive reasoning and other basic methods of logic. To be\nsure, that the Mohists did not articulate this pattern of reason\nexplicitly could support the claim that their use of it was little\nmore than a trivial exercise of our unconscious aptitude for deductive\nreason, and hence unwarranted as a distinctive feature of their\nphilosophy. Even if this is true, however, its consistency with the\ntext makes it not unlikely that they were on the verge of discovering\nit, for they did endeavor to provide analyses of linguistic form,\nwhich point in the direction of formalization, and with the apparent\nintention of testing theories about various patterns of inference (see\n section 3.4\n below).\n\nGoing with this idea, it has been suggested that the Mohists did\nrealize a distinction between predicates and singular terms in their\nclassification of names: recall that in A78 lei refers to\nnames that classify (they may be true or admissible of many things,\nlike predicates), whereas si refers to names that are fixed\nto individual objects (like singular terms). When we add the Mohists\u2019\nthird category, unrestricted (da), we have a set of names\nthat Lucas (2020) identifies as corresponding to the three basic\nsyntactic categories that are common to the notations of formal logic:\nindividual variables (whose values may be unrestricted), predicates\n(whose values are determined extensionally by classes), and individual\nconstants (or singular terms, whose values are fixed to individual\nobjects). This gives us some liberty, at least, for thinking of simple\nMohist statements in terms of the basic form of predication\n\u201c\\(F(a)\\)\u201d, and even for allowing for the use of\nquantifiers and variables, \\(\\forall x(\\textit{F}x)\\)and \\(\\exists\nx(\\textit{F}x)\\).\n\nIt was noted above that for the Mohists our capacity to correlate\nobjects in various ways is exercised when we name particular objects\nand then apply these names to all objects that are analogous to them.\nWe correlate objects consistently in virtue of a model fa\n(\u201cthat in being like which something is so\u201d) (A70), and we\nidentify a class from this model by ascertaining the resemblance\nrelation between it and other objects. Indeed, according to Graham, by\nidentifying an object as a \u201chorse\u201d based on its\nresemblance with the standard for horses, we are in effect treating\nthe name ma (\u201chorse\u201d)\n\n\nas an abbreviation of \u201csomething which is like the\nobject\u201d, the object being the particular for which the name is\nordained. (2003 [1978]: 325)\n\n\nHence, on this interpretation, when the Mohists say you ma\n(\u201cThere is a horse\u201d), or \\(\\exists x(\\textit{Horse}(x))\\),\nthey are, in effect, making an assertion that the particular object to\nwhich they are referring is such that it correctly resembles the model\nfor horses. (The term you would have been taken to imply\nexistence.) That is to say,\n\n(P1)\nThere is an object x such that x resembles the\nmodel m for horses.\n\n\nWe can extend this idea to assertions of Classical Chinese of the form\n\u2018F G ye\u2019, which we gloss here as \u201cAll\nF are G\u201d, or \u201cF are\nG\u201d (with F functioning as a generic\nquantifier). For example, taking the expression bai ma\n(\u201cwhite horse\u201d) to represent \u201cany x that\nresembles the model \\(m_1\\) for white horse\u201d and ma\n(\u201chorse\u201d) for \u201cany x that resembles the\nmodel \\(m_2\\) for horse\u201d, the basic form of the assertion\n\u201cWhite horses are horses\u201d would be:\n\n(P2)\nAny x that resembles the model \\(m_1\\) for white horse\nresembles the model \\(m_2\\) for horse.\n\n\nThis seems to captures the Mohists\u2019 view for basic nominal\nassertions, but there are problems with it, however. Resemblance is\nnormally construed as a relation that is both reflexive and symmetric.\nNotice that the model \\(m_1\\) for white horse resembles itself, if\n\\(\\forall x(\\textit{Resembles}(x,x))\\) is assumed. In virtue of P2,\nthe model \\(m_1\\) resembles the model \\(m_2\\). Since the color white\nis irrelevant to the criterion required for the resemblance to\n\\(m_2\\), it must be in virtue of its shape that \\(m_1\\) resembles\n\\(m_2\\). (Shape is a common example the Mohists use to distinguish\nhorses when color is irrelevant.) But then, given symmetry,\n\n\\[ \\forall x\\forall y(\\textit{Resembles}(x,y) \\leftrightarrow \\textit{Resembles}(y,x)), \\]\n\n\n\\(m_2\\) resembles \\(m_1\\), by the same criterion. This would warrant\nthe conclusion that any model \\(m_i\\) that satisfies the requisite\ncriterion of shape for \u201chorse\u201d would warrant the name\n\u201cwhite horse\u201d, regardless of its color. Hence, a model\nthat is brown would warrant the name \u201cwhite horse\u201d.\n\nThese are undesirable consequences of this view, but they do follow on\nstandard analyses of resemblance. Did the Mohists really intend it\nthis way? More careful exegesis suggests probably not, but scholarship\non Mohist thought has tended to gloss over semantic subtleties in\nfailing to recognize that in Classical Chinese the term for\nresemblance (tong) is highly polysemous, with different\nmeanings that the Mohists endeavored to distinguish (Fung 2020b). In\nA86\u20137 of the Canons the Mohists articulate four\ndistinct senses of sameness or resemblance (tong), along with\ndifference (yi), corresponding roughly to the notions of\nbeing identical, being the units of a whole or class, constituting the\nsame object, and being of the same kind:\n\nSameness: Identical, as units, as together, as of a kind.\n\nNote the inclusion of identity; the Mohists use tong\nvariously much in the way the copula \u201cis\u201d functions in\nEnglish. What is obvious from the explanations they provide of these\nterms is that, however much their stock illustrations appeal to acts\nof perception, the Mohists are using their technical term\ntong much more broadly than mere perceptual likeness. They\ninclude identity, as noted, as when two names refer to the same thing\nor have the same extension (gou \u201cdog\u201d and\nquan \u201ccanine\u201d were typical examples). Moreover,\nnot only may two horses appear alike perceptually (being of the same\nshape or having four legs), but a hand may be \u201cthe same\nas\u201d Mozi (being a part of Mozi) or the same as another part of\nMozi, the hardness and whiteness of a stone may be the same in partly\nconstituting the same object (\u201cas together\u201d), and Mozi may\nbe \u201cthe same as\u201d a human (in that he is \u201cof the\nkind\u201d human). These examples make it evident, moreover, that\ntong was intended to cover both mereological and member-set\nrelations (cf. Fraser 2007). Such relations are obviously not always\nsymmetrical, and while there is no direct evidence that the Mohists\nwere perplexed by the specific problem posed above, it is evident that\ntheir own definitions provided them with various means of\nresponse.\n\nFor purposes here, one way to do this is to adopt the generic notion\nof an admissible substitute, taking care to provide criteria of\nadmissibility that is inclusive enough to capture the points in the\nanalysis above. For instance, any white horse can stand as an\nadmissible substitute for the model for \u201chorse\u201d, but it is\nnot true that any horse can serve as an admissible substitute for\n\u201cwhite horse\u201d.\n\n(P3)\nAny x that is an admissible substitute for the model\n\\(m_1\\) for F is an admissible substitute for the model\n\\(m_2\\) for G.\n\n\nWhy do some things count as admissible substitution instances but not\nothers? More specifically, what is it in virtue of a thing that makes\nit \u201cresemble\u201d something else? The Mohists do give many\nillustrations of relevant criteria, making it evident that there are\ndifferent kinds; shape, color, and function are common examples. As\nnoted above, we judge the squareness of a piece of wood by the\nsimilarity of its shape with a carpenter\u2019s T-square, and say\nthat a horse is white because of its color, not its shape. We also\njudge that a horse is blind because its eyes are impaired in their\nfunction.\n\nIndeed, given that the Mohists did not claim to provide an exhaustive\nlist of these criteria, and that the text refers to them mainly by way\nof example (T-squares, blind horses), the door is open to the view\nthat virtually anything can stand as a criterion of resemblance and\nmay even be regarded as \u201cappropriate\u201d depending on the\ncontext of reference.\n\nMou (2016) argues that the Mohists identified these criteria through\nfeatures of salience in variable fields of cognitive focus: an aspect\nof a thing can stand as a criterion of resemblance provided only that\nwe, as language users, single it out either through an act of\nperception or through a mental act in which one\u2019s attention is\nconcentrated inward (such as on a mental image). Furthermore, this\naspect may be used appropriately in that the judgments we make may be\ntrue or false depending on whether it is singled out in such an\nattentive act. For example, the judgment \u201cA white horse is not a\nhorse\u201d may be deemed false if the salient aspect of our mental\nfocus is on the \u201chorse-ness\u201d feature of each entity\nindicated (white horse and horse). But it may also be deemed true if\nthe salient aspect is \u201cwhiteness\u201d, since whiteness is a\nfeature that may be true of some horses but not others.\n\nMou\u2019s account situates this view in the context of an account of\nreference that requires two joint determinants in every referential\nact: (1) an undifferentiated semantic-whole that is referred to\nindependently of any particular aspect or feature, and (2) a\nparticular aspect or feature that is rendered salient by our faculties\nof attention. Mou argues that this dual-reference account provided the\nMohists with the flexibility to determine the truth or falsehood of\njudgements variously by situating each determination in a context that\narises out of the many \u2013 perhaps infinite \u2013 ways in which\nwe can identify things. At the same time, this account was also\nintended to provide an objective ground for the determination of the\ntruth of our judgments by requiring that reference (and correlatively\nour knowledge of the identities of objects) be determined in each act\nby a mind-independent whole from which any particular aspect is\nidentified.\n\nWhether or not the Mohists held anything like this dual-reference\naccount, it is clear that which criteria the Mohists found relevant\ndepended on what they found \u201cappropriate\u201d in comparisons\nof things, and the identification of these criteria was no doubt both\na central part of the Mohists\u2019 research program and a source of\nongoing controversy in debates with their opponents. But given the\nsubtlety with which the Mohists analyzed their key terms, they seem to\nhave been increasingly sensitive to the worry that no exhaustive list\nis possible.\n\nMoreover, they were aware that simple terms might have complex or\npolysemous meanings, and that the problems of analysis are compounded\nas terms are combined into larger expressions. As a result, it became\nincreasingly evident that complex expressions of the same grammatical\nform can have different conditions of satisfaction. An example from\nthe Lesser Selection (Xiao Qu) noted above comes\nfrom their analysis of the expressions \u201cloving people\u201d\n(ai ren) and \u201criding horses\u201d (cheng\nma):\n\n\nLoving people requires loving all people without exception, only then\nis this called loving people. Not loving people does not require\nloving no people at all; it is (rather) not loving all people without\nexception, and by this it is called not loving people. Riding horses\ndoes not require riding all horses without exception; it is (rather)\nriding some horses, and by this it is called riding horses. But not\nriding horses does require riding no horses at all; only by this is it\ncalled not riding horses. These are cases in which something applies\nwithout exception in one case but not in the other. (Xiao Qu;\ntr. Graham 2003 [1978])\n\n\nThe Mohists are pointing out here that the predicate \u201cloves\npeople\u201d is satisfied only by those who happen to love all\npeople, whereas the predicate \u201crides horses\u201d is satisfied\nby anyone who happens to ride at least one horse. By the same token,\nthe predicate \u201cdoes not love people\u201d is satisfied by\nanyone who fails to love at least one person, whereas the predicate\n\u201cdoes not ride horses\u201d requires that one ride no horses at\nall. To take another example, the Mohists observe that the name for\n\u201cboth\u201d (ju) works differently in combination with\ndifferent names; we say \u201cThey both fight\u201d (ju\ndou), but not \u201cThey both are two\u201d (ju er).\nAgain, while the name fu means \u201chusband\u201d on its\nown, its combination with yong yields the sense \u201cbrave\nman\u201d (yong fu) without any reference to a husband,\nindicating that complex meanings are not necessarily mere products of\ntheir constituent parts (B3). Revelations such as these prompted what\nis aptly characterized as a linguistic turn in Mohist philosophy, as\nthe Mohists concentrated their attention on language itself and the\nimplications its grammatical forms have on the analysis of\nmeaning.\n",
