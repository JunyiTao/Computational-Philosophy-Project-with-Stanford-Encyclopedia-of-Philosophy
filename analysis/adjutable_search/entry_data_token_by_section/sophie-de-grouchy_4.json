    "main_text": "Enlightenment and Revolution || The Gironde\n2.3 The Gironde\n\nOne faction of the Revolution that was particularly welcoming to women\nwas the Gironde. This was in part at least because their unofficial\nleader, Brissot, found it easy to admire and respect women\u2019s\nintellect. He had known Catharine Macaulay in England and been\ninstrumental in her republican History of England being\ntranslated to French. He was a close friend and correspondent of Manon\nRoland and had published (anonymously, following her wishes) several\nof her reflections on the Revolution in his paper Le Patriote\nFrancois. Brissot was also a close friend and collaborator of\nfellow editor Louise Keralio-Robert. It was he who convinced the\nFrench Theatre to put on Olympe de Gouges\u2019s abolitionist play,\nZamore and Mirza, and then invited her to join his Society of\nFriends of the Black. He was also on the editorial board of Le\nR\u00e9publicain, and advertised it in Le\nPatriote.\n\nCondorcet was strongly implicated in the Girondist party by February\n1793 as he drafted the Gironde\u2019s constitutional project. In July\n1793, a list of 21 \u201cproscribed\u201d Girondins was issued, and\n39 names (including Condorcet\u2019s) were added shortly afterwards.\nBrissot and twenty-one others were arrested. They were tried on 24\nOctober and executed on the last day of that month. It took just over\nhalf an hour for the twenty-two heads to fall. Others who had escaped,\nincluding Manon Roland\u2019s husband (the interior minister\nJean-Marie Roland) and her lover (the politician Fran\u00e7ois\nBuzot) committed suicide shortly afterwards. After several months\nspent in hiding in Paris, Condorcet too attempted to escape. He died\nin prison in Bourg-la-Reine in March 1795, either by swallowing poison\nhidden for him in a ring by his brother in law Cabanis or from a heart\nattack brought on by his long walk from Paris.\n\nMany of the projects began by the Gironde were more or less given up\nby those who came after, including the abolition of slavery and the\nemancipation of women.\n",
