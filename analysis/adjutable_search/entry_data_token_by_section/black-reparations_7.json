    "main_text": "The Inheritance Argument\n8. The Inheritance Argument\n\n\nThe inheritance argument for black reparations states that the freed\npeople had rights to reparations for their injuries; that they held\nthese rights against the slave holders and also against the state and\nfederal governments for failing in their duties to protect them from\nthe slave holders; that these rights were never honored; and finally,\nthat they passed on the right of inheritance to present day U.S. blacks\nwho are their descendants and heirs. (Corlett 2010)\n\nThis argument avoids the objection that the present black population\nwould not exist if their ancestors had never been enslaved. And each\npremise seems plausible. When people die their rights to their property\nare normally passed on to their heirs (Boxill 1972: 113\u2013122;\nKershnar 1999: 95\u2013101). The reparations owed to the freed people\nwas their property; it was never in their physical possession of\ncourse, but obviously something need not be in your possession to be\nyour property. Neither did the freed people abandon their inheritance.\nLaws and guns very forcefully kept it from them. Consequently, it\nshould pass, by right of inheritance, to their descendants, the present\nblack\n population.[3]\n\nTwo important objections against the inheritance argument are: first\nthat it relies on the counterfactual claim that the freed people and\ntheir descendants would have held on to their reparations had they\nreceived it; and second that it demands that people make reparations\nfor the injuries of a crime that they could not have committed. Let us\nbegin with the second.\n\nLocke\u2019s discussion of a lawful conqueror\u2019s rights to\nreparations suggests how to solve it. \u201cThe right of\nConquest\u201d, Locke claims, \u201cextends only to the Lives of\nthose who joyn\u2019d in the War, not to their Estates, but only in\norder to make reparation for the damages received, and the Charges of\nthe War, and that too with reservation of the right of the innocent\nWife and Children\u201d (Locke 1689: sec. 180). Locke\u2019s claim is\nthat the lawful conqueror has rights to reparations from the estates of\nthose who unjustly waged war against him, though some part of these\nestates should be reserved for their wives and children. The clear\nimplication is that the wives and children would have gotten a larger\npart of the estates in question had their husbands and fathers not\nharmfully transgressed against the lawful conqueror; but Locke would be\nguilty of self-contradiction if he had meant that the wives and\nchildren were being forced to pay or make reparations for the harms\ntheir fathers\u2019 and husbands\u2019 the crimes caused. His view\nwas that when people unjustly harm others, a portion of their estates\nmay be used to make reparations to the people they harmed, and as a\nnecessary result their children cannot inherit that portion of their\nestates.\n\nThe following argument parallels Locke\u2019s argument: the slave\nholders harmed the slaves. Consequently the slaves had rights to\nreparations against the estates of the slave holders; these rights\nreduced the extent of the estates that the slave holders\u2019\nchildren would otherwise have inherited from them; the slaves were\nforcibly prevented from exercising those rights; but it is absurd to\nsuppose that people lose rights just because they are forcibly\nprevented from exercising those rights; consequently the slaves\nretained their rights against the estates of the slave holders; present\nday U.S. blacks are their heirs; consequently present day U.S. blacks\nhave rights against the estates of the slave holders. This argument\ndoes not prove much. Even if many descendants of the slave holders can\nbe identified, proving that they inherited their property from their\nslave holding ancestors seems hopeless. But the argument can be\nimproved. The first step is to see that the slaves did not have rights\nto reparations only against the slave holders. This step may seem to\nfollow easily from Locke\u2019s famous theory that residence in a\nstate is tacit consent to it (Locke 1689: sec 119). This theory applied\nto the case of the lawful conqueror might seem to commit Locke to the\nview that the lawful conqueror had rights to reparations against all\nmembers of the state that waged the unjust war against him. But in fact\nLocke explicitly denied that it did. \u201cThe people\u201d he said\ngave \u201cto their governors no power to do an unjust thing, such as\nis to make an unjust War, (for they never had such power in\nthemselves:) They ought not to be charged as guilty of the Violence and\nInjustice that is committed in an Unjust war, any further than they\nactually abet it\u201d (Locke 1689: sec 179).\n\nAnd he identified those who \u201cactually abet\u201d and unjust\nwar as those who \u201cassisted, concurred, or consented\u201d, to\nthat war (Locke 1689: sec 179). It may seem that Locke is guilty of\nself-contradiction here at least if we suppose that to consent to\nsomething, even tacitly, is to give the \u201cpower\u201d, that is,\nthe right to do it. But Locke evidently did not suppose that to consent\nto another\u2019s action is to give the other the right to do it; and\nno one else supposes that it does, except perhaps confused\nphilosophers. For such a supposition implies that one could not consent\nto another\u2019s unjust action since of course one cannot give\nanother a right to act unjustly, but of course people can and do often\nconsent to another\u2019s unjust action. To consent to another\u2019s\naction is \u201cto make oneself a partner in the other\u2019s action\nand to accept a share in the responsibility for it\u201d (Boxill 1993:\n96\u201399). This suggestion may seem to leave us with the conclusion\nthat if voluntary residence in a state is tacit consent to it, as\nLocke\u2019s theory says, then all the residents of a state must have\naccepted responsibility for the state\u2019s actions, including its\nunjust wars, and consequently that the just conqueror must have rights\nto reparations against all residents of the state. But, as we have\nseen, Locke denies that the lawful conqueror has such rights. The\nsolution to this puzzle lies in a peculiarity of most signs of tacit\nconsent. The peculiarity is that signs of tacit consent are normally\nconditions people have good reason to be in other than to give their\nconsent. Thus voluntary residence in a state is a sign of tacit consent\nto it because most residents of a state have good reason to reside in\nthe state other than to give consent to it. Since a sign of consent\nwould be coerced, and consequently not a sign of consent if not making\nit is impossible or very costly, it follows that every sign of tacit\nconsent, like residence in a state, must be such as to allow people to\nmake the sign, while withdrawing their consent by making some cheap and\neasily performed sign of dissent. This reasoning suggests how Locke can\nsay both that voluntary residence in a state is tacit consent to its\nactions and that the lawful conqueror has rights to reparations from\nonly those who \u201cassisted, concurred, or consented\u201d, to\ntheir state\u2019s unjust wars against him. All voluntary residents of\na state have tacitly consented to its actions but only those who fail\nto make some sign of dissent to its unjust wars, have consented to its\nwaging these wars, at least if there are signs of dissent that are\nrelatively easy to make and are not too costly.\n\nReturning to the question of reparations for slavery, U.S. citizens\nprior to the Civil War knew that their government permitted and\nsupported slavery and also knew that slavery was a crime. The slave\nholding states certainly tried to conceal the full horrors of their\n\u201cpeculiar institution\u201d but the evidence suggests that their\nefforts were not successful. Consequently, since few white U.S.\ncitizens expressed dissent from their government\u2019s complicity in\nthe crime of slavery, although it did not punish such dissent, it seems\nfair to conclude that most white U.S. citizens voluntarily consented to\ntheir government\u2019s complicity in the crime. In Locke\u2019s\nlanguage, they \u201cassisted, concurred, or consented\u201d to the\ngovernment\u2019s injustice against the slaves. Therefore, still\nfollowing Locke, it follows that the slaves had rights to reparations\nagainst almost the entire white population of the United States for the\ndamages that their enslavement caused them. This argument is perhaps\nopen to the objection that there was in the period of slavery more than\na little dissent to the government\u2019s complicity in the crime of\nslavery; certainly the abolitionists strongly expressed their dissent.\nOr alternatively it could be objected that dissenting from the\ngovernment\u2019s complicity in slavery in the Deep South did carry\nconsiderable costs including costs not necessarily imposed by the\ngovernment. Finally, the argument also requires a fuller account of\nwhat residents of a state must do in order to make appropriate signs of\ndissent from the injustice of their government, and consequently to\navoid being rightly accused of consenting to that injustice.\nPresumably, confiding to a few friends that one was opposed to slavery\nwould not be enough. But if these problems can be satisfactorily\nsettled, then since the slaves had titles to reparations against the\nestates of those who assisted, concurred or consented to their\nenslavement, they would have titles to reparations against practically\nthe entire white population, not just against the estates of the\nslave holders. These reparations were never paid. Instead each\nwhite generation specified that only whites of the succeeding\ngeneration were permitted to own, or compete for, or be educated by,\nthe assets it was leaving behind. Since the slaves had titles to\nreparations against these assets, and the present generation of U.S.\nblacks is the slaves\u2019 heir, the present generation of U.S. blacks\nhas inherited titles to a portion of the assets held by the present\nwhite population. This includes the white immigrants who arrived in the\nU.S. after the abolition of slavery to take advantage of opportunities,\nfunded by assets the slaves had titles to, or for the education the\nslaves and descendants were prevented from getting, or to take natural\nassets including land that the slaves also had titles to. The fact that\nthey competed for these opportunities and worked hard misses the point\nsince many of these \u201cso called\u201d opportunities had already\nbeen inherited by and were the property of, the slaves\u2019 heirs\n(Corlett 2010: 161\u2013186).\n\nLocke put a limit on the right to reparations. In the case he\ndiscussed, the lawful conqueror\u2019s right to reparations was\nlimited by reservations made for the rights of the wife and children of\nthose engaged in or consented to the unjust war against him. As Locke\nput it:\n\n\nThe Conqueror has a Title to Reparations for Damages received, and\nthe Children have a Title to their Father\u2019s Estate for their\nSubsistence\u2026What must be done in the case? I answer; The\nFundamental Law of Nature being, that all, as much as may be, should be\npreserved, it follows, that if there be not enough fully to satisfy\nboth, viz, for the Conqueror\u2019s Losses, and the Children\u2019s\nMaintenance, he that hath, and to spare, must remit something of his\nfull Satisfaction, and give way to the pressing and preferable Title of\nthose, who are in danger to perish without it. (Locke 1689:\nsec.183)\n\n\n\nThus Locke appeals to the Fundamental Law of Nature which requires\nthat all or as much as may be should be preserved in order to argue\nthat that the lawful conqueror\u2019s right to reparations must give\nway if it comes into conflict with the rights to subsistence and\nmaintenance of the children of those who owe him reparations. But Locke\ndoes not say that the lawful conqueror\u2019s right to reparations is\ntrumped by the children\u2019s right to inheritance; on his\naccount, it is the right to subsistence that trumps the right to\nreparations when the two rights conflict. When Locke limits the\nconqueror\u2019s right to reparations, he does so in order to\naccommodate the rights to subsistence of innocent children. He is\nconcerned that such children will die if he presses the right to\nreparations too hard, not that they will inherit very little.\n\nDo these reasonable limitations on the right of inheritance have any\nrelevance to whether U.S. blacks have a right to inherit the\nreparations owed their slave ancestors? Here it is important to note\nthese limitations do not abolish or cancel the right to inheritance.\nThey do not imply, that is, that there is no right to inherit at all.\nThey allow that there is such a right, and that it holds in normal\ncircumstances, but that it fails to hold or is outweighed when allowing\nit to hold would make innocent people destitute, or create large\ninequalities that are likely to lead to exploitation and domination. In\nother words, we cannot set aside the inheritance argument just because\nit depends on the right of inheritance. We can set aside the\ninheritance argument aside only if implementing it would make innocent\npeople destitute or create large inequalities that are likely to lead\nto their exploitation and domination. But would implementing the\ninheritance argument have these results? It would not. The slaves were\nhorribly harmed by slavery, but paying or making reparations to them\nwould not have required turning over a continent to them. It would have\ncalled for no horrendous uprooting of populations, or driven anyone\ninto poverty, or created morally outlandish inequalities. The slaves\nwould not suddenly have become the masters and the whites their\nsubordinates. The nation could have made reparations and suffered mild\ndiscomfort at worst. As for the right of inheritance of their heirs, we\nmust remember that it is not limited by the mere length of time between\nbenefactor and heir. The right of inheritance is limited by the\ndangerous and morally repugnant inequalities that would result from\nhonoring it. These could appear after one generation, or fail to appear\nafter ten generations. We are certainly not referring here to a statute\nof limitations. It would be wrong for someone\u2019s immediate heir to\ninsist on his right to inherit his father\u2019s goods if this would\ncause undue hardship to others, or put him in a position to oppress\nthem. But it would be right for someone\u2019s distant heir to insist\non her right to inherit his goods if this could save her from hardship\nor oppression at the hands of her debtors. But is not this latter case\nexactly similar to that of U.S. blacks? Would they not save themselves\nfrom hardship and oppression at the hands of their debtors if they\ninsisted on their right to inherit the reparations that were owed their\nslave ancestors and never paid?\n",
