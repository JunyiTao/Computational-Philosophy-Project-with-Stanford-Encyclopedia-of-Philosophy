    "main_text": "Formal and Material Consequence\n2. Formal and Material Consequence\n\nThe strongest and most widespread proposal for finding a narrower\ncriterion for logical consequence is the appeal to formality.\nThe step in (4) from \u201cPeter is Greg\u2019s mother\u2019s\nbrother\u2019s son\u201d to \u201cPeter is my cousin\u201d is a\nmaterial consequence and not a formal one, because to make\nthe step from the premise to the conclusion we need more than the\nstructure or form of the claims involved: we need to\nunderstand their contents too.\n\nWhat could the distinction between form and content\nmean? We mean to say that consequence is formal if it depends on the\nform and not the substance of the claims involved.\nBut how is that to be understood? We will give at most a sketch,\nwhich, again, can be filled out in a number of ways.\n\nThe obvious first step is to notice that all presentations of the\nrules of logical consequence rely on\n schemes.\n Aristotle\u2019s syllogistic is a proud example.\n\nFerio: No \\(F\\) is \\(G\\). Some \\(H\\) is \\(G\\). Therefore\nsome \\(H\\) is not \\(F\\).\n\n\nInference schemes, like the one above, display the structure of valid\narguments. Perhaps to say that an argument is formally valid is to say\nthat it falls under some general scheme of which every instance is\nvalid, such as Ferio.\n\nThat, too, is an incomplete specification of formality. The material\nargument (4) is an instance of:\n\n\\(x\\) is \\(y\\)\u2019s mother\u2019s brother\u2019s\nson.\n\nTherefore, \\(x\\) is \\(y\\)\u2019s cousin.\n\n\nevery instance of which is valid. We must say more to explain why some\nschemes count as properly formal (and hence a sufficient ground for\nlogical consequence) and others do not. A general answer will\narticulate the notion of\n logical form,\n which is an important issue in its own right (involving the notion of\n logical constants,\n among other things). Instead of exploring the details of different\ncandidates for logical form, we will mention different proposals about\nthe point of the exercise.\n\nWhat is the point in demanding that validity be underwritten by a\nnotion of logical form? There are at least three distinct proposals\nfor the required notion of formality, and each provides a different\nkind of answer to that question.\n\nWe might take the formal rules of logic to be totally neutral\nwith respect to particular features of objects. Laws of\nlogic, on this view, must abstract away from particular features of\nobjects. Logic is formal in that it is totally general. One\nway to characterise what counts as a totally general notion\nis by way of permutations. Tarski proposed (1986) that an operation or\npredicate on a domain counted as general (or logical) if it was\ninvariant under permutations of objects. (A permutation of a\ncollection of objects assigns for each object a unique object in that\ncollection, such that no object is assigned more than once. A\npermutation of \\(\\{a, b, c, d\\}\\) might, for example, assign \\(b\\) to\n\\(a, d\\) to \\(b, c\\) to \\(c\\) and \\(a\\) to \\(d\\).) A \\(2\\)-place\npredicate \\(R\\) is invariant under permutation if for any permutation\n\\(p\\), whenever \\(Rxy\\) holds, \\(Rp(x)p(y)\\) holds too. You can\nsee that the identity relation is permutation\ninvariant\u2014if \\(x = y\\) then \\(p(x) = p(y)\\)\u2014but\nthe mother-of relation is not. We may have permutations \\(p\\)\nsuch that even though \\(x\\) is the mother of \\(y\\), \\(p(x)\\) is not the\nmother of \\(p(y)\\). We may use permutation to characterise logicality\nfor more than predicates too: we may say that a one-place sentential\nconnective \u2018\\(\\bullet\\)\u2019 is permutation invariant if and\nonly if, for all \\(A\\), \\(p(\\bullet A)\\) is true if and only if \\(\\bullet\np(A)\\) is true. Defining this rigorously requires establishing how\npermutations operate on sentences, and this takes us beyond the scope\nof this article. Suffice to say, an operation such as negation passes\nthe test of invariance, but an operation such as \u2018JC believes\nthat\u2019 fails.\n\nA closely related analysis for formality is that formal rules are\ntotally abstract. They abstract away from the semantic\ncontent of thoughts or claims, to leave only semantic\nstructure. The terms \u2018mother\u2019 and \u2018cousin\u2019\nenter essentially into argument (5). On this view, expressions such as\npropositional connectives and quantifiers do not add new semantic\ncontent to expressions, but instead add only ways to combine and\nstructure semantic content. Expressions like \u2018mother\u2019 and\n\u2018cousin\u2019, by contrast, add new semantic content.\n\nAnother way to draw the distinction (or to perhaps to draw a different\ndistinction) is to take the formal rules of logic to be\nconstitutitive norms for thought, regardless of its subject\nmatter. It is plausible to hold that no matter what we think about, it\nmakes sense to conjoin, disjoin and negate our thoughts to make new\nthoughts. It might also make sense to quantify. The behaviour, then,\nof logical vocabulary may be used to structure and regulate\nany kind of theory, and the norms governing logical\nvocabulary apply totally universally. The norms of valid argument, on\nthis picture, are those norms that apply to thought irrespective of\nthe particular content of that\n thought.[1]\n",
