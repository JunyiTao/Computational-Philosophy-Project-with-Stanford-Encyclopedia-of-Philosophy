    "main_text": "Life and Works\n1. Life and Works\n\nIsaac\n Polqar[1]\n was a Jewish philosopher who was a member of the Jewish Averroist\nSchool. He lived from the second half of the thirteenth century to the\nfirst half of the fourteenth century in northern\n Spain.[2]\n Little is known about Polqar\u2019s life and family. A short poem,\nwritten in his honor by a contemporary poet, Samuel Ibn Sasson,\nreveals that Polqar was known for his philosophical knowledge as well\nas for his expertise in the study of the Bible and the Mishnah. In\naddition, Sasson indicates that Polqar was also a poet, a physician,\nand a respected figure in his community (Baer 1938: 200).\n\nPolqar wrote several books, most of which are lost. He mentions some\nof these books in his main work \u02bfEzer ha-Dat (In\nSupport of the Law): Peirush le-Sefer Bereshit\n(Commentary on Genesis) [\u02bfEzer ha-Dat: 39];\nPeirush le-Sefer Kohelet (Commentary on\nEcclesiastes) [\u02bfEzer ha-Dat: 121, 123]; Sefer\nPeirush le-Tehillot (Commentary on the Book of Psalms)\n[\u02bfEzer ha-Dat: 131]; and Musar ha-Banim\n(Instruction of the Sons) [\u02bfEzer ha-Dat: 158].\nTwo of Polqar\u2019s works\u2014Iggeret ha-Tiqvah\n(Epistle on Hope) and Sefer be-Hak\u1e25ashat\nha-\u02bfi\u1e93tagninot (Refutation of\nAstrology)\u2014are mentioned by Abner of Burgos, the famous\nconvert to Christianity and polemicist against Judaism, in his\nTeshuvot la-Me\u1e25aref (Response to the\n Blasphemer)[3]\n and Min\u1e25at Qenaot (A\n Jealousy-Offering).[4]\n Two of Polqar\u2019s works are extant: Teshuvat Apikoros\n(A Response to the\n Heretic),[5]\n a letter he addressed to\n Abner,[6]\n and his major corpus, \u02bfEzer ha-Dat (In Support of\nthe Law). In addition, Polqar completed Isaac Albalag\u2019s\nwork Tiqqun De\u02bfot ha-Philosophim (Rectifying the\nOpinions of the Philosophers), a free paraphrase of\nal-Ghaz\u0101l\u012b\u2019s Maqasid al-Fal\u0101sifa\n(The Opinions of the Philosophers), most of which consists of\nAlbalag\u2019s own ideas and of a critique of\nal-Ghaz\u0101l\u012b\u2019s presentation of philosophical ideas (see\nVajda 1960: 268).\n\nPolqar\u2019s main work \u02bfEzer ha-Dat is comprised of\nfive treatises. In the opening treatise, Polqar argues for the primacy\nof Jewish Law over other existing religious laws. For him, the Torah\nis the best law, and Moses, the lawgiver, is the paramount leader.\nTogether, they provide Jewish believers with the necessary groundwork\nfor attaining their ultimate purpose: the world to come. In this\ntreatise Polqar highlights particular themes, such as the exile and\nits meaning, faith in the messiah\u2019s ultimate arrival, Talmudic\nmethodology and its authority, and how to interpret the words of the\nSages. The choice of these themes seems to have been motivated by the\nChristians having made use of them in order to argue for the\nsuperiority of Christianity over Judaism.\n\nThe second treatise is composed of several different dialogues. The\nmain dialogue depicts a lively debate between two men with disparate\nworldviews: one is an old man who represents a traditional and\nanti-philosophical approach, while the other is a young man who is\nstrongly drawn to philosophy. The debate between these two figures\nreflects a well-known controversy between traditionalist Jews who were\nsuspicious of philosophy and Jewish philosophers who aimed to\nreconcile the study of philosophy with revelation. In this dialogue,\nthe traditionalist, as we shall see below, accuses the philosophers of\nholding heretical views such as denying God\u2019s unity, His\nomnipotence, His omniscience, and so forth, as a result of following\nGreek philosophy. The young philosopher, on the other hand, claims\nthat there is no contradiction between the Jewish faith and\nAristotelian philosophy.\n\nThe third treatise of the book is most likely based on the\ncorrespondence between Polqar and his former teacher Abner regarding\nastrology. The dialogue in this treatise is between a\n philosopher[7]\n (\u1e25aver) and an astrologer (hover). Whereas\nthe latter holds an extreme view of determinism, the former believes\nin man\u2019s free will.\n\nThe fourth treatise of the book presents a typology of four different\ngroups of people, who, according to Polqar, constitute the greatest\nenemies of Judaism and, as a consequence, of philosophy. The first\ngroup consists of those who reject science while claiming to be true\nbelievers. The second includes the Kabbalists, who claim to have\naccess to esoteric knowledge reaching back to the prophets, and who\nreject the philosopher\u2019s methods (such as syllogism) as\nlegitimate tools for evaluating knowledge claims. The third group\ncomprises those who accuse philosophers of holding radical\nnaturalistic views. According to this group, philosophers assert that\neverything is governed by nature and that even God cannot change its\ncourse. For these traditionalists, then, philosophers have turned\nnature into God\u2019s rival, not His intermediary. The fourth group\nincludes people who believe in magic, witchcraft, and the like.\n\nThe fifth treatise ends the book and describes a conversation between\na spirit and a man who lives in the material world. These two figures\ndebate the question of which is preferable: to be alive, when one can\nfully enjoy bodily and intellectual pleasures, or to be dead, when\none\u2019s soul is free from bodily desire. Polqar concludes this\nsection with a revelation: the two interlocutors hear the voice of the\nangel Gabriel, who supports the spirit\u2019s position according to\nwhich the soul\u2019s detachment from the body is preferable.\n",
