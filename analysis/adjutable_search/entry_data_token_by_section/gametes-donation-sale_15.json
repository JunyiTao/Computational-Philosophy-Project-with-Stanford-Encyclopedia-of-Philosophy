    "main_text": "Donor Matching and Selection || Characteristics Related to \u2018Race\u2019\n3.3 Characteristics Related to \u2018Race\u2019\n\nQuestions and concerns have also been raised regarding the\nappropriateness of selection on the basis of characteristics related\nto \u2018race\u2019, such as skin, eye, and hair colour. Had gamete\ndonor selection been well known in the 1980s when discussion raged\nconcerning whether trans-racial adoption practices constituted a step\nin the right direction towards the social ideal of colour-blindness, a\nform of racial and cultural genocide, or something in between the two,\none might have expected to see similar discussions regarding donor\nselection. This, however, has not been the case and instead, the\nphilosophical literature on race-based selection has tended to focus\non the question of whether selection of race-based characteristics is\nappropriate at all.\n\nFor the most part, this focus is due to contemporary debates regarding\nthe question of whether the concept of race is philosophically and\nscientifically defensible. Thus, work suggesting the removal of racial\nidentifiers on donor catalogues seems to owe a great deal to authors\nsuch as K. Anthony Appiah (1995, 1996) and Naomi Zack (1993, 2002) who\nboth deny that race is a coherent concept and recommend discarding it\nentirely (see the entry on\n race).\n\nFogg-Davis (2001), for example, suggests that both the practice of\nreproducing race through assisted reproduction and selecting donors on\nthe basis of different race-linked characteristics are problematic as\nthey raise two major linked ethical issues:\n\n\none is the harm that racial stereotyping causes to individuals, and\nthe second is the public awareness that racial stereotyping is an\naccepted feature of this largely unregulated market.\n\n\nShe suggests that those who use racial classification to inform donor\nselection decisions are communicating that\n\n\nrace is heritable and relevant to their vision of family\nstructure \u2026 that a person\u2019s gametes are transmitters of\nracial meaning that can and should be selectively transmitted to their\nchild through the use of reproductive technologies. (Fogg-Davis 2001:\n18)\n\n\nHarris (1998) too questions the legitimacy of the desire to match\ndonors to recipient parents on the basis of race-linked\ncharacteristics such as skin tone, and hair and eye colour. He\nnotes:\n\n\nWhy do so many people firmly believe that children should be like\ntheir parents, particularly in terms of their general colour and\nracial characteristics? It is difficult not to view this desire, and\nattempts to implement it, as a form of \u2018ethnic cleansing.\u2019\nIt smacks very much of the pressure that so many societies and\ncultures have put upon their members not to \u2018marry out\u2019 or\nto put it more bluntly, not to mate with somebody of another tribe or\nrace. (Harris 1998: 21)\n\n\nOthers suggest, however, that there is \u201cno evidence to suggest that\nracial prejudice accounts for why sperm banks sort sperm donors\naccording to race or why many prospective parents hope for a child of\na particular race.\u201d (Fox 2009: 1860) Such authors hold instead that\nracial preferences in gamete donation are more likely to stem from a\ndesire to replicate the family structure of the biological family, to\navoid deficient access to racial culture and consciousness (Maung\n2019:114), to increase their children\u2019s prospects in unjust\nsocial contexts (Savulescu & Kahane 2009), or premised on a desire\n\u201cto make the donor invisible and to conform the new-founded\nfamily to the ideal of the natural family\u201d (Pennings 2000: 508).\nAs Wong (2017) notes: \u201crecipient parents who choose not to prioritise\nmatching \u2026 may embark on a project of queering heteronormative family\nstructures and place great trust in both their own children and\nchanging social attitudes to reduce stigma and generate acceptance for\nnon-traditional families.\u201d (Wong 2017:77).\n\nGiven such considerations, it has been argued that although race-based\nselection should not be condemned in all cases it is important to\n\u201csoften the prominence of race in donor selection by taking\nmeasures to frustrate wholesale filtering of sperm donors on the basis\nof race\u201d (Fox 2009: 1893). Others still note that those who\ndesire to select for race-linked characteristics for these \u2018less\nobjectionable\u2019 reasons must still consider the wider\nconsequences of doing so. Maung (2019), for example, suggests that\nwhile a desire to respect the rights of marginalised communities to\nmaintain their ethnic identities, and to ensure that donor conceived\nchildren from historically subjugated ethnic groups develop a positive\nethnic identity, and reap the benefits of belonging to a community\nwith a rich shared history, such concerns should be \u201ccounterbalanced\nby the concern about capitulating to the racialist assumptions that\nenabled that subjugation in the first place\u201d (Maung 2019:115).\nBerkowitz & Snyder (1998), Agar (2004) and Marway (2018) make\nsimilar points when considering the question of race-based selection\nof offspring. They suggest that while the aim of increasing the life\nprospects of one\u2019s children in racist and homophobic societies\nby selecting for heterosexual and light skinned offspring is not\nobjectionable, such practices should not be permitted. For, not only\nwould such selection collude with prejudice, constituting an\ninappropriate response to a social problem, but it would likely also\nundermine attempts to change racist and homophobic social attitudes\nand practices.\n",
