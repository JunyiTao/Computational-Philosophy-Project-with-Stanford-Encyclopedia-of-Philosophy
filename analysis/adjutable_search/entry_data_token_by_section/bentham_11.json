Civil Law and Political Economy\n\nThe subordinate ends of civil law are security, subsistence,\nabundance, and equality, in this order of priority. \u201cThe more\nperfect enjoyment is in all these respects\u201d, Bentham wrote,\n\u201cthe greater is the sum of social happiness: and especially of\nthat happiness which depends upon the laws\u201d (1840 [1864], I,\n96). As we have seen, security is maintained by laws that protect\nproperty and the expectations derived from ownership, and uphold the\ncontracts that facilitate the trade in goods and services. Subsistence\nand abundance are also derived from this source. When an overall\nabundance exists but not all enjoy the necessary means of subsistence,\nthen legislative intervention may be conducted in accordance with the\n\u201cdisappointment-prevention principle\u201d, such as when the\nstate takes ownership of an estate for which there is no legitimate\nheir (122\u201323), or when a tax on income or property can be\nintroduced without materially detracting from a person\u2019s\nexpectations, and the funds accrued used to provide food and basic\nservices to those in need. Based on this redistribution of wealth, a\ndegree of equalization is also achieved (Kelly 1990, 191\u201397), an\nobjective entirely consistent with the view that, properly understood,\nthe utility principle entails a presumption in favour of an equal\ndistribution, unless there is compelling empirical evidence that\nutility would not be served by such a policy. As Bentham put it in\nLeading Principles of a Constitutional Code,\n\u201cthe more remote from equality are the shares \u2026 the less\nis the sum of felicity produced by the sum of those shares\u201d\n(1838\u201343, II, 276).\n\nThe theory of \u201cdiminishing marginal utility\u201d also lends\nsupport to equalization policies, dictating that decreases to the\nwealth of a rich man cause less pain than similar decreases to a poor\nman, while additions to the wealth of the poor man bring happiness in\na greater amount than they would to a rich man (1840 [1864], I,\n103\u20139). In First Principles Preparatory to Constitutional\nCode, written 1822 but not then published, Bentham went further,\nto postulate that the greatest happiness of the people \u201crequires\nthat the external instruments of felicity, whatsoever they may be, be\nshared by the whole number in a proportion so near to equality as is\nconsistent with universal security\u201d (1989, 16; see also 1840\n[1864], I, 104). However, he refused to countenance the idea that\npolicies to redistribute wealth at the cost of security would\nbe beneficial either to social prosperity or individual wellbeing.\nProposals to alter the distribution of wealth in line with diminishing\nmarginal utility must, therefore, be conducted in accordance with the\n\u201cdisappointment-prevention principle\u201d.\n\nOn the other hand, Bentham believed that a system of laws based on the\nutility principle would gradually and \u201cindirectly\u201d evolve\ntowards greater equality in the distribution of goods, and pointed to\nthe historical evidence of post-feudal Europe in support of his\nposition. In the long run the key to achieving a more equal\ndistribution of property lay in abundance: \u201cin a nation\nprosperous in its agriculture, its manufactures and its commerce,\nthere is a continual progress towards equality\u201d (1840 [1864], I,\n123). The important caveat Bentham introduced to justify this optimism\nis the proviso that government must not impede this tendency by\nallowing monopolies, putting \u201cshackles\u201d on trade and\nindustry, or placing obstacles in the path of the division of property\non inheritance.\n\nBentham believed that facilitating individuals in the pursuit of their\ninterests in a free market is what government should do, because this\nis the proven best way to maximise the public good. Where\nlaissez-faire does not produce the best result, however, the\nlegislator must act in other direct and indirect ways to produce the\noptimal outcome. The question, as Bentham explained in Manual of\nPolitical Economy, \u201cis to know what ought and what ought\nnot to be done by government. It is in this view, and in this view\nonly that the knowledge of what is done and takes place without the\ninterference of government can be of any practical use\u201d\n(1952\u201354, I, 224). In the Institute of Political\nEconomy, he argued that past experience provided sufficient\nevidence to convince us that governments should not act in the\neconomic realm as much as they often do, hence the motto \u201cBe\nquiet\u201d and the lists of \u201cNon-agenda\u201d items. Where\ndepartures from this general rule are required\u2014such as when\nvital subsistence goods would be priced beyond the reach of\nmany\u2014they become \u201cAgenda\u201d items for government\n(1952\u201354, III, 333; see also 247\u2013302). But radical schemes\nfor property re-distribution are ruled out; the axiomatic requirement\nthat each be treated equally, that the happiness of each be counted,\njustified policies to equalize the distribution of goods only where\nthis could be achieved without disappointing legitimate\nexpectations.\n",
