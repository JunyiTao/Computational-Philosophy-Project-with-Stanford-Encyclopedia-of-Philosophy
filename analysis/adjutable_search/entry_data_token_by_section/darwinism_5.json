    "main_text": "The Five Core Philosophical Problems Today || The Nature, Power and Scope of Selection\n3.2 The Nature, Power and Scope of Selection\n\n  The core of Darwin\u2019s\ntheory is the concept of natural selection. Perhaps because of his use of the term selection, this\ncore element of his theory apparently baffled nearly everyone.\nCould it be, as Lyell, Herschel and Darwin\u2019s great American defender\nAsa Gray would ask, an \u2018intermediate cause\u2019, i.e. a causal\nprinciple instituted and sustained by God?  Or is it, in its very\nnature, the antithesis of such a principle, as his old geology teacher\nSedgwick believed?  Could it possibly create species, or is it, by its\nnature, a negative force, eliminating what has already been created by\nother means?  In one of his copies of On the Origin of\nSpecies, Alfred Russell Wallace crosses out \u2018natural\nselection\u2019 and writes \u2018survival of the fittest\u2019 next\nto it. Wallace always felt that \u2018selection\u2019\ninappropriately imported anthropomorphic notions of Nature choosing\npurposefully between variants into natural history. And, in a\ndevastating review, Fleeming Jenkin happily accepted the principle of\nnatural selection but challenged its power to modify an ancestral\nspecies into descendent species, and thus limited its scope to the\nproduction of varieties.  A number of reviewers, even some sympathetic\nones, questioned the possibility of extending the theory to account\nfor the evolution of those characteristics that differentiate humans\nfrom their nearest relatives.\n2.",
