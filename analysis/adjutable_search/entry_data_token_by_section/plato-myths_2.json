This is what real\nphilosophers, like Socrates, do. But the non-philosophers are\nreluctant to ground their lives on logic and arguments. They have to\nbe persuaded. One means of persuasion is myth. Myth inculcates\nbeliefs. It is efficient in making the less philosophically inclined,\nas well as children (cf. Republic 377a ff.), believe noble\nthings.\n\nIn the Republic the Noble Lie is supposed to make the\ncitizens of Callipolis care more for their city. Schofield (2009)\nargues that the guards, having to do philosophy from their youth, may\neventually find philosophizing \u201cmore attractive than doing their\npatriotic duty\u201d (115). Philosophy, claims Schofield, provides\nthe guards with knowledge, not with love and devotion for their city.\nThe Noble Lie is supposed to engender in them devotion for their city\nand instill in them the belief that they should \u201cinvest their\nbest energies into promoting what they judge to be the city\u2019s\nbest interests\u201d (113). The preambles to a number of laws in the\nLaws that are meant to be taken as exhortations to the laws\nin question and that contain elements of traditional mythology (see\n790c3, 812a2, 841c6) may also be taken as \u201cnoble\nlies\u201d.\n\nThe following myths are eschatological: Gorgias\n523a\u2013527a, Meno 81a\u2013d, Phaedo\n107c\u2013115a, Phaedrus 246a\u2013257a, Republic\n614b\u2013621d, and Laws 903b\u2013905d. The stories they\ntell differ\u2014to a greater or lesser extent\u2014although some\nthemes occur in more than one of them: the judgement of souls for\ntheir earthly life, their subsequent punishment or reward, the\ncontemplation of forms in the other world, and reincarnation (which,\nin the Phaedo 81d\u2013e, is part of the soul\u2019s\npunishment or reward; see also the Timaeus 42c\u2013e and\n90e\u201392c). These are Plato\u2019s myths, but they feature many\nelements and deities of classical mythology (such as Zeus, Prometheus,\nHestia, Necessity and the Fates). For good surveys of Plato\u2019s\neschatological myths see Annas (1982) and Inwood (2009); see also the\nentries on myth and eschatology in Press and Duque (2022). For the\nrelationship between philosophy and religion in Plato see Nightingale\n(2021). O\u2019Meara (2017, 114) argues that the Timaeus and\nthe Statesman are \u201creformed Panathenaic\u201d\nfestivals\u2014in which Zeus (Timaeus) and Athena\n(Statesman) are \u201creformed\u201d\u2014while the\nLaws is a \u201creformed Dionysian festival\u201d (in which\nDionysus is \u201creformed\u201d).\n\nPlato\u2019s eschatological myths are not complete lies. There is\nsome truth in them. In the Phaedo the statement \u201cThe\nsoul is immortal\u201d is presented as following logically from\nvarious premises Socrates and his interlocutors consider acceptable\n(cf. 106b\u2013107a). After the final argument for immortality\n(102a\u2013107b), Cebes admits that he has no further objections to,\nnor doubts about, Socrates\u2019 arguments. But Simmias confesses\nthat he still retains some doubt (107a\u2013b), and then Socrates\ntells them an eschatological myth. The myth does not provide evidence\nthat the soul is immortal. It assumes that the soul is immortal and so\nit may be said that it is not entirely false. The myth also claims\nthat there is justice in the afterlife and Socrates hopes that the\nmyth will convince one to believe that the soul is immortal and that\nthere is justice in the afterlife. \u201cI think\u201d, says\nSocrates, that \u201cit is fitting for a man to risk the\nbelief\u2014for the risk is a noble one\u2014that this, or something\nlike this, is true about our souls and their dwelling places\u201d\n(114d\u2013e). (Edmonds (2004) offers a interesting analysis of the\nfinal myth of Phaedo, Aristophanes\u2019 Frogs and\nthe funerary gold leaves, or \u201ctablets\u201d, that have been\nfound in Greek tombs). At the end of the myth of Er (the\neschatological myth of the Republic) Socrates says that the\nmyth \u201cwould save us, if we were persuaded by it\u201d (621b).\nMyth represents a sort of back-up: if one fails to be persuaded by\narguments to change one\u2019s life, one may still be persuaded by a\ngood myth. Myth, as it is claimed in the Laws, may be needed\nto \u201ccharm\u201d one \u201cinto agreement\u201d (903b) when\nphilosophy fails to do so.\n\nSedley (2009) argues that the eschatological myth of the\nGorgias is best taken as an allegory of \u201cmoral malaise\nand reform in our present life\u201d (68) and Halliwell (2007) that\nthe myth of Er may be read as an allegory of life in this world.\nGonzales (2012) claims that the myth of Er offers a \u201cspectacle\n[that] is, in the words of the myth itself, pitiful, comic and\nbewildering\u201d (259). Thus, he argues, \u201cwhat generally\ncharacterizes human life according to the myth is a fundamental\nopacity\u201d (272); which means that the myth is not\nactually a dramatization of the philosophical reasoning that unfolds\nin the Republic, as one might have expected, but of\neverything that \u201csuch reasoning cannot penetrate and master,\neverything that stubbornly remains dark and irrational: embodiment,\nchance, character, carelessness, and forgetfulness, as well as the\ninherent complexity and diversity of the factors that define a life\nand that must be balanced in order to achieve a good life\u201d\n(272). The myth blurs the boundary between this world and the other.\nTo believe that soul is immortal and that we should practice justice\nin all circumstances, Gonzales argues, we have to be persuaded by what\nSocrates says, not by the myth of Er. Unlike the eschatological myths\nof the Gorgias and Phaedo, the final myth of the\nRepublic illustrates rather \u201ceverything in this world\nthat opposes the realization of the philosophical ideal. If the other\nmyths offer the philosopher a form of escapism, the myth of Er is his\nnightmare\u201d (277, n. 36).\n",
