    "main_text": "\n\n\nMany-valued logics are non-classical logics. They are similar to\nclassical logic because they accept the principle of\ntruth-functionality, namely, that the truth of a compound sentence is\ndetermined by the truth values of its component sentences (and so\nremains unaffected when one of its component sentences is replaced by\nanother sentence with the same truth value). But they differ from\nclassical logic by the fundamental fact that they do not restrict the\nnumber of truth values to only two: they allow for a larger set\n\\(W\\) of truth degrees.\n Just as the notion of \u2018possible worlds\u2019 in the\nsemantics of modal logic can be reinterpreted (e.g., as \u2018moments\nof time\u2019 in the semantics of tense logic or as\n\u2018states\u2019 in the semantics of dynamic logic), there does\nnot exist a standard interpretation of the truth degrees. How they are\nto be understood depends on the actual field of application. It is\ngeneral usage, however, to assume that there are two particular truth\ndegrees, usually denoted by \u201c0\u201d and \u201c1\u201d. These\nparticular truth degrees act, respectively, like the traditional truth\nvalues \u201cfalsum\u201d and \u201cverum\u201d \u2013 but\nsometimes also like \u201cabsolutely false\u201d and\n\u201cabsolutely true\u201d, particularly in cases in which the\ntraditional truth values of classical logic \u201csplit\u201d into a\nseries of truth degrees.\n\nMany-valued logics treat their truth degrees as technical tools, and\nintend to choose them suitably for particular applications. It is a\nrather difficult philosophical problem to discuss the (possible,\nnon-technical) nature of such \u201ctruth degrees\u201d or\n\u201ctruth values\u201d. The interested reader can consult the\nmonograph Shramko/Wansing (2011) or the entry on \n truth values.\n\n\nThe formalized languages for systems of many-valued logic\n(MVL) follow the two standard patterns for propositional and predicate\nlogic, respectively:\n\nthere are propositional variables\ntogether with connectives and (possibly also) truth degree constants in\nthe case of propositional languages,\n\nthere are object variables together with predicate symbols, possibly\nalso object constants and function symbols, as well as quantifiers,\nconnectives, and (possibly also) truth degree constants in the case of\nfirst-order languages.\n\n\n\nAs usual in logic, these languages are the basis for semantically as\nwell as syntactically founded systems of logic.\n",
