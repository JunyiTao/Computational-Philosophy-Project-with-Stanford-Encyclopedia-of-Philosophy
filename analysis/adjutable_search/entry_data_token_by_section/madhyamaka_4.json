    "main_text": "Bh\u0101vaviveka || Life and works\n4.1 Life and works\n\nBh\u0101vaviveka, who was also known as Bhavya and Bh\u0101viveka, was\nprobably active in the middle part of the sixth century. His\ncommentary on MMK, entitled Praj\u00f1\u0101prad\u012bpa\n(Lamp of Wisdom), now extant only in Chinese and Tibetan translations,\ncontains not only his interpretation of N\u0101g\u0101rjuna\u2019s\nthoughts but also critiques of Buddhap\u0101lita\u2019s approach to\nMadhyamaka, about which more will be said below, and critiques of the\nBuddhist abhidharma tradition. Praj\u00f1\u0101prad\u012bpa\nalso incorporates critiques of such non-Buddhist schools as\nS\u0101\u1e43khya, Vai\u015be\u1e63ika and the Jains.\n\nIn addition to his commentary to MMK, Bh\u0101vaviveka wrote an\nimportant independent verse treatise on Madhyamaka entitled\nMadhyamakah\u1e5bdayak\u0101rik\u0101 (Verses on the Heart\nof Centrism) to which he provided a prose commentary called\nTarkajv\u0101l\u0101 (Flame of Reasoning). This combination\nof works comprises eleven chapters.\n\nOn cultivating and maintaining bodhicitta, that is, the\naspiration to become enlightened in order to work for the benefit and\nultimate liberation of all sentient beings\nFollowing the Buddhist vows\nStriving for a knowledge of reality\nReality as understood by the conservative canonical Buddhists\n(\u015ar\u0101vakas)\nReality as understood by the Yog\u0101c\u0101ra school of\nBuddhism\nReality as understood by the S\u0101\u1e43khya school\nReality as understood by the Vai\u015be\u1e63ika school\nReality as understood by the Ved\u0101nta schools\nReality as understood by the M\u012bm\u0101\u1e43s\u0101\nschool\nThe realization of omniscience\nOn the characteristics of praise\n\n\nAs the titles of the chapters of this work show, Bh\u0101vaviveka was\na student of most of the important movements in Indian philosophy of\nhis era and sought to stake out the place of the Madhyamaka school\nwithin Buddhism as a whole. His understanding of Madhyamaka was\nimportantly different from Buddhap\u0101lita\u2019s. Their different\napproaches turned out to define two of the three important sub-schools\nof Madhyamaka.\n",
