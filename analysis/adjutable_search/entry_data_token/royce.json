Life\n\nRoyce was born November 20, 1855, in the remote mining town of Grass\nValley, California, to Josiah and Sarah Eleanor Bayliss Royce. Sarah\nRoyce was a devout Christian who headed a primary school in Grass\nValley. Royce\u2019s mother and older sisters directed his early\neducation. At age 11 he entered school in San Francisco. He graduated\nfrom the newly established University of California in Oakland with a\nB. A. degree in Classics in 1875. Royce then traveled to Germany to\nstudy philosophy for one year, mastering the language and attending\nlectures in Heidelberg, Leipzig, and G\u00f6ttingen. On his return, he\nentered the Johns Hopkins University in Baltimore, Maryland, where he\nearned a Ph. D. in 1878.\n\nHe taught composition and literature at the University of California,\nBerkeley from 1878\u20131882. During this time he published numerous\nphilosophical articles, as well as his Primer of Logical\nAnalysis. He married Katherine Head in 1880. The couple had three\nchildren (Christopher 1882; Edward 1886; Stephen 1889) and remained\nmarried until Josiah\u2019s death. Not content in California, so far\nfrom the intellectual life of the East Coast, Royce sought help in\nattaining a new post from his acquaintances there. In his later\nethical writings Royce would stress the centrality of action intended\nto realize a sound ideal that one has freely embraced. When offered\nthe opportunity to replace William James during a one year sabbatical\nat Harvard University, Royce acted: he accepted the offer of half of\nJames\u2019s salary, resigned his California appointment altogether,\nand moved his wife and newborn son across the continent in the summer\nof 1882.\n\nIn Cambridge, Royce commenced to work doggedly and in diverse areas.\nIn January 1883 he arrived at an insight that proved fundamental to\nhis philosophy: in order for our ordinary concepts of truth and error\nto be meaningful, there must be an Absolute Knower, an actual infinite\nmind that encompasses the totality of all actual truths and possible\nerrors. This insight formed the core of his first major philosophical\npublication, The Religious Aspect of Philosophy, which\nappeared in 1885. Royce received a permanent appointment as assistant\nprofessor at Harvard in that same year. (During his three decades at\nHarvard Royce would teach such notable students as T. S. Eliot, George\nSantayana, and W. E. B. Du Bois.) He taught full time, gave many\npublic lectures, published his History of California in 1886,\nand a novel in 1887. In 1888 he experienced a nervous breakdown, from\nwhich he recovered after a sea voyage of some months\u2019\nduration.\n\nRoyce was appointed Professor of the History of Philosophy at Harvard\nin 1892 and served as Chair of the Department of Philosophy from\n1894\u201398. During these years Royce established himself as a\nleading figure in American academic philosophy with his many reviews,\nlectures and books, including The Spirit of Modern Philosophy\n(1892) and The Conception of God (1895). In 1898 Royce\nattended a series of lectures by Charles S. Peirce, \u201cReasoning\nand the Logic of Things,\u201d which significantly influenced his\nunderstanding of the relation between logic and metaphysics.\n\nRoyce delivered the prestigious Gifford Lectures at the University of\nAberdeen in two series, the first in 1899 and the second the following\nyear. He regarded this as the opportunity to consolidate his years of\nhard thought and study, so as to produce a definitive and original\nstatement of his metaphysics. The result was his two volume opus\nThe World and the Individual (1899\u20131901).\n\nThe Gifford Lectures marked a turning point in Royce\u2019s life and\nthought. He had worked out his philosophical theories in minute\ndetail. His public reputation as a philosopher was sealed (Royce was\nelected president of the American Psychological Association in 1902\nand of the American Philosophical Association in 1903). The year 1900\napparently represented the culmination of his life\u2019s work. Royce\nwas only 45 years old, though, and this culmination proved also to be\na starting point for significant growth.\n\nReviews of The World and the Individual praised Royce\u2019s\nphilosophical acumen but raised significant objections to his\nconclusions. Peirce, in particular, pointedly criticized Royce\u2019s\nuse of logic. Royce set out to reconsider his central arguments and,\nat the same time, undertook an ambitious program of study in\nmathematical logic. In his teaching and publications after 1900, two\nphilosophical strains came to the forefront. One was a growing\nreliance on formal logical and mathematical concepts as the basis for\nhis metaphysical speculation (the first hint of this appears in the\n\u201cSupplementary Essay\u201d to the first volume of The World\nand the Individual). The second was an emphasis on philosophy as\na means to understand the concrete phenomena of life: the nature of\nhuman society, of religious experience, of ethical action, of\nsuffering and the problem of evil.\n\nAfter 1907 Royce\u2019s emphasis on the relevance of philosophy for\nliving took on a clear personal dimension. In that year Christopher,\nwho had come with Josiah and Katherine across the continent as a\nnewborn 25 years earlier, and who had graduated from Harvard at age\n18, showed symptoms of severe depression and psychotic delusions. In\n1908 his parents committed him to a state mental hospital with little\nhope that he would recover. In August of 1910 William James died,\nleaving Royce without his closest friend, neighbor and colleague. In\nSeptember of the same year Christopher Royce died of typhoid fever,\nleaving Josiah and Katherine without their firstborn child. Royce had\nearlier stated his philosophy in a somewhat abstract and formal way,\nso that it might help him discover metaphysical truth. Perhaps under\nthe weight of these later sorrows, Royce returned to his system\nseeking wisdom and understanding in addition to truth.\n\nAlthough he by no means abandoned systematic and theoretical\nphilosophy, Royce began to write more about what today would be called\n\u201cpractical\u201d or \u201capplied\u201d philosophy. His major\nwork on ethics, The Philosophy of Loyalty, appeared in 1908.\nLater he would address ethics in even more practical terms, not as a\nphilosophy but as an \u201cart\u201d of loyalty. He published a\ncollection of essays under the title Race Questions,\nProvincialism, and Other American Problems in 1908; another\ncollection, entitled William James and Other Essays on the\nPhilosophy of Life, appeared in 1911. Four of the six essays in\nThe Hope of the Great Community, written in the last year of\nhis life and published posthumously in 1916, directly concerned global\npolitics and the Great War.\n\nRoyce and James had always disagreed deeply concerning the proper\nunderstanding of religious phenomena in human life. When James\ndelivered the Gifford Lectures in 1901 and 1902, he directed many\narguments against Royce\u2019s idealism, though he did not there\ntarget his friend by name. James\u2019s lectures, published as\nThe Varieties of Religious Experience, were a popular and\nacademic success. Royce believed that James, who had never been\nregularly affiliated with an established church or religious\ncommunity, had in that work placed too much emphasis on the\nextraordinary religious experiences of extraordinary individuals.\nRoyce\u2019s first education was into a strongly Protestant world\nview, he always retained a respect for the conventions of organized\nChristianity, and his writings exhibit a consistent and deep\nfamiliarity with Scripture. He sought a philosophy of religion that\ncould help one understand and explain the phenomena of ordinary\nreligious faith as experienced by communities of ordinary people.\nThere was a deeper difference between them, as well, and it centered\non a metaphysical point. Royce\u2019s 1883 insight concerning the\nAbsolute was at bottom a religious insight. Contrary to the open-ended\npluralism and pragmatism of James, Royce was convinced that the object\nand source of religious experience was an actual, infinite, and\nsuperhuman being. Royce did not attempt to work out his religious\nphilosophy until after James\u2019s death, however. In 1911 Royce\nfinally composed the lectures that responded to James. These were\npublished in 1912 as The Sources of Religious Insight. It is\nhere that the theoretical and practical threads of his late thought\nbegan to come together. Royce himself said of the Sources:\n\u201cIt contains the whole of me in a brief compass\u201d\n(Clendenning 1970, 570).\n\nIn early 1912, Royce suffered a stroke. During his recovery, he\ncontinued to explore the philosophy of religion outlined in the\nSources, with an eye toward adapting these ideas specifically\nto Christianity. He also returned to Peirce\u2019s writings, seeking\nthe solution to certain nagging problems in his own metaphysics. He\nfound in Peirce\u2019s semeiotic, or theory of signs, the technical\ntools he needed to address both issues at once. The Problem of\nChristianity presents, in place of the earlier Absolute Knower,\nthe concept of an infinite community of interpretation guided by a\nshared spirit of truth-seeking. This Universal Community, which\nconstitutes reality, develops greater understanding over time through\nits members\u2019 continual development of the meaning of signs.\nWithin this framework Royce endeavored to reconcile and explain many\nkey Christian doctrines and experiences.\n\nThough Royce lived only a few years beyond this late philosophical\nbreakthrough, his last period brought the true culmination and\nflowering of his life\u2019s work. Besides The Sources of\nReligious Insight and The Problem of Christianity,\nnotable available works include The Hope of the Great\nCommunity, his last Harvard seminar on Metaphysics\n(1915\u201316) and a series of lectures given at the University of\nCalifornia at Berkeley. These lectures at his alma mater were to have\nended with a talk entitled \u201cThe Spirit of the Community.\u201d\nWhen the Great War broke out, Royce set this manuscript aside and\nsketched a practical proposal to use the economic power of insurance\nto mediate hostilities among nations and hence reduce the attraction\nof war in the future. War and Insurance (1914) was a daring\npolitical and economic proposal on behalf of the Universal\nCommunity.\n\nRoyce died on September 14, 1916. Though scholars now recognize the\noriginality and strength of his last works, he was unable to respond\nto critics or to press his case for the last crucial innovations to\nhis philosophy. His reputation was eclipsed as other philosophers used\nRoyce\u2019s earlier writings as a foil in developing their own\ndoctrines of pragmatism, realism, empiricism, and logical analysis.\nWhile scholars of American intellectual life have always acknowledged\nthe historical importance of Royce\u2019s influence, recent years\nhave brought a revival of interest in Royce\u2019s thought on its own\nterms. Royce\u2019s work is proving especially fruitful for\ntheologians and philosophers interested in speculative philosophy and\nmetaphysics, practical and theoretical ethics, philosophy of religion,\nand the philosophy of community.\n2. Philosophy\n\nRoyce\u2019s early studies in Germany and at the Johns Hopkins\nUniversity concentrated on the development of post-Kantian idealism.\nHis philosophical work as a whole may be regarded as a committed\nidealist\u2019s effort to understand the place of finite individuals\nin an infinite universe, a theme that Royce captured most succinctly\nin his Gifford Lectures title, \u201cThe World and the\nIndividual.\u201d This theme will serve as a touchstone in the\nfollowing survey of Royce\u2019s work in metaphysics and\nepistemology, ethics and practical philosophy, religious philosophy,\nand logic.\n2.1 Metaphysics and Epistemology: Idealism and Interpretation\n\nRoyce announced the beginning of his professional career with a novel\ndefense of absolute idealism, \u201cthe argument from error.\u201d\nKant had introduced the notion of a \u201ctranscendental\nargument\u201d by asking what the world must be like in order for\nknowledge of the world to be possible. In The Religious Aspect of\nPhilosophy Royce took the experience of error \u2014 a\nparticularly compelling aspect of the phenomenon of knowing \u2014 as\nthe starting point for his own transcendental argument. According to\nthe correspondence theory of knowledge an idea (or judgment) is true\nif it correctly represents its object; error obtains when an idea does\nnot correctly represent its object. It is indisputable that finite\nminds do sometimes entertain erroneous ideas. Royce pointed out that\nin such a case the mind must contain an (erroneous) idea and its\n(false) object, while simultaneously intending, or \u201cpointing\ntoward,\u201d the idea\u2019s true object. If the mind is able to\nintend the true object then that object is somehow available to the\nmind. How can it be that the true object is in this way available to\nthe mind, but not known? Consider what happens in an ordinary example\nof error: if I think that my keys are on the table, but later discover\nthat they are in my pocket, I do not conclude that my keys never\nexisted as the object of my thought. Rather, I focus on an idea that I\nhad all along \u2014 that my keys do definitely exist somewhere. The\nkeys, their location, and all other facts about them are the true\nobject of an idea. At the moment when I discover that my keys are not\non the table, it becomes apparent that this true object was only\nimperfectly available to me. The fact that such error does occur\nindicated to Royce that the true object of any idea must exist, in a\nfully determinate or absolute state, in some actual mind, or mind-like\nentity, with which my own mind is or may be connected. From the\npossibility of error, Royce concluded that there is an Absolute\nKnower, a mind for which all thoughts do correspond correctly and\nadequately to their true objects.\n\nOne objection to the argument from error is that another type of\nobjective reality, some other sort of being external to one\u2019s\nfinite mind, might explain the possibility of error just as well.\nRoyce took up this objection in the first volume of The World and\nthe Individual, which was subtitled \u201cThe Four Historical\nConceptions of Being.\u201d In this extended argument Royce critiqued\nwhat he regarded as the main competing conceptions of objective\nreality so as to strengthen his case for idealism. The first\nconception of being Royce considered was realism, the view\nthat the world exists entirely independently of our thoughts or ideas\nabout it. The world is what it is, in short, without any reference to\nour thoughts. While this view has great common-sense appeal and does\nprovide for an objectively existing sphere of being against which our\nideas can apparently be measured, Royce pointed out a fundamental\nproblem. Realism, so defined, introduces a radical metaphysical\ndualism. Between my ideas, and a sphere of being that by definition\nexists completely independent of those ideas, there is a gap that\ncannot be bridged. Realism posits an objective realm that is utterly\nindependent and hence, strictly speaking, is utterly meaningless to\nthought. The theory of mysticism, the second conception of\nbeing Royce considered, likewise meets with problems. This view\nmaintains that the real is the ineffable immediate fact that is\npresent to the mind. Mysticism avoids the problem of an unbridgeable\ngap between idea and reality by completely denying any such gap. The\ndifficulty here is that one cannot then distinguish between idea and\nreality. If reality is in the end the immediate content of my idea,\nthen error in my idea of reality would simply appear to be impossible.\nThe third conception of being, which Royce identified with Kantian\ncritical rationalism, is presented as a correct but\nincomplete view. Royce characterized critical rationalism as the view\nthat \u201cWhat is, gives warrant to ideas, makes them true, and\nenables us to define determinate, or valid, possible\nexperiences\u201d (Royce 1899\u20131901 [1976, 266]). The real is\nthat which, in conforming to given universal structures or categories\nof experience, is capable of validating certain ideas. The connection\nbetween my ideas and an objectively existing sphere of being is\nclearly established: my ideas and that sphere both conform to the same\ncategories of experience. The independence of objective reality, and\nhence the possibility of error, is likewise preserved: I may form an\nidea of a definite possible experience (e.g., that my keys are on the\ntable) but then discover that reality does not validate my idea (I can\nin fact check the table surface and discover that my keys are not\nthere). The critical rationalist conception is inadequate, in\nRoyce\u2019s view, because it is restricted to describing the\nuniversal forms and possibilities of experienced reality. It cannot in\nRoyce\u2019s view account for the concrete, actual individual facts\nthat impose themselves in experience. These are simply and\nmysteriously \u201cgiven\u201d in the critical rationalist\ntheory.\n\nRoyce endeavored to extend and complete critical rationalism in his\nexplanation of the \u201cfourth conception of being.\u201d\nTo say that an idea intends its object means more than that the idea\nmay be validated by a \u201cpossible experience.\u201d An idea in\nthis respect embodies a purpose: that its meaning shall be fulfilled\nin experience. In Royce\u2019s view this requires a world that is\nmore than the abstract or merely hypothetical content posited by the\ndescription of a possible experience. What is needed is a definite,\nactual individual being that exists \u201cin an absolutely final\nform.\u201d Royce thus agreed with critical rationalism in saying\nthat a true idea is one that may be fulfilled or validated by a\npossible experience. He argues further, though, that such a possible\nexperience requires the existence of an actual being (e.g., the\nparticular set of keys in my pocket) that is in principle capable of\nbeing experienced. It is this being, the actual individual, and not\nthe mere possible experience of it, that is the object of knowledge\nand \u201cthe essential nature of Being\u201d (Royce\n1899\u20131901, [1976, 348]). The \u201cfourth conception of\nbeing\u201d detailed in The World and the Individual\nprovides the metaphysical background for the remainder of\nRoyce\u2019s thought. It presents a view of the totality of Being as\nan actual Infinite Individual that is itself timeless, encompassing as\nit does all valid past, present, and future possible experience of\nfact. All finite beings, such as ourselves, are but fragments of this\nAbsolute Mind or eternal truth.\n\nIn his last period Royce embraced what may be called a hermeneutic\nepistemology. While he still maintained the central notion that a true\nidea correctly represents its object, he arrived at a new\nunderstanding of the nature of representation. Earlier, he had rather\nuncritically taken \u201crepresentation\u201d to be a\nstraightforward correspondence relation in which the idea merely\ncopied its object. Under the influence of Peirce\u2019s theory of\nsigns, however, Royce came to appreciate the creative, synthetic, and\nselective aspects of representation. The new semiotic conception is\ndetailed in the chapter of The Problem of Christianity\nentitled \u201cPerception, Conception and Interpretation.\u201d\nKnowledge is not at bottom merely the accurate and complete perception\nof an object, as empiricism would have it. Nor is it the accurate and\ncomplete conception of an idea, as rationalism maintains. Knowledge is\ninstead a process of interpretation: the true idea selects,\nemphasizes, and re-presents those aspects of the object that will be\nmeaningfully fulfilled in subsequent experience. Royce\u2019s\n\u201cabsolute pragmatism,\u201d like other versions of pragmatism,\nthus offers an alternative to rationalism and empiricism.\n\nThis revised understanding of knowledge as interpretation prompted, if\nit did not exactly require, a corresponding change in Royce\u2019s\nnotion of the Infinite Mind whose reality was established in the\nargument from error. As long as knowledge is regarded as possessing\nperceptions or conceptions that correspond to objects, the Infinite\nMind is naturally envisioned as something that \u201ccontains\u201d\nthe totality of all perceptions or conceptions. If knowledge is\ninstead regarded as a process of interpretation, though, the Infinite\nMind may be regarded as the mind that carries this process forward.\nRoyce had long sought an explicitly non-Hegelian account of Absolute\nMind. In The Problem of Christianity he was finally able to\nreplace the old terminology of the Absolute with a description of an\ninfinite Community of Interpretation. This community is the totality\nof all those minds capable of representing aspects of Being to one\nanother or to their future selves. Royce summarized the metaphysical\nimplications of this new view by saying \u201cthe real world is the\nCommunity of Interpretation\u2026 If the interpretation is a\nreality, and if it truly interprets the whole of reality, then the\ncommunity reaches its goal [i.e., a complete representation of Being],\nand the real world includes its own interpreter\u201d (Royce 1913\n[2001, 339]). In this late period Royce remained firmly committed to\nidealism. He renounced the notion that the Absolute is complete at any\nactual time, though, and instead preferred to think of the possible\ntotality of all truth simply as the eternal.\n2.2 Ethics and Practical Philosophy\n\nThat Royce\u2019s metaphysical solution to the problem of error was\nof broad relevance for the rest of his philosophy is clear: \u201cThe\nexistence of error\u2026must be explained as due to the same\nconditions as those which make possible finite life, evil,\nindividuality, and conflict in general\u201d (Robinson 123). Error is\npossible, according to Royce, only if there is an infinite being for\nwhich all intended objects could be realized. This Being (whether\nconceived as Absolute Mind or the infinite Community of\nInterpretation) also makes individual human life comprehensible.\nRoyce\u2019s considerable attention to speculative metaphysics is\ncomplemented by his concern for the practical implications of that\nmetaphysics. The infinite manifests itself in the realm of individual\nbeings bound within the finite constraints of time and space. Ethics\nand religion have their basis in this relation of the individual to\nthe infinite real world, a relation Royce characterized in terms of\nloyalty.\n2.2.1 The Philosophy of Loyalty\n\nNear the end of The Philosophy of Loyalty Royce wrote:\n\nHuman life taken merely as it flows, viewed merely as it passes by in\ntime and is gone, is indeed a lost river of experience that plunges\ndown the mountains of youth and sinks in the deserts of age. Its\nsignificance comes solely through its relations to the air and the\nocean and the great deeps of universal experience. For by such poor\nfigures I may, in passing, symbolize that really rational relation of\nour personal experience to universal conscious\nexperience\u2026.(Royce 1908 [1995, 179\u201380])\n\n\nRoyce\u2019s ethics is rooted in his analysis of the conditions\nnecessary for an individual life to be meaningful. It is not enough\nthat one\u2019s actions merely conform to the strictures of\nconventional morality \u2014 a trained animal might well fulfill such\nminimal conditions of morality. To lead a morally significant life,\none\u2019s actions must express a self-consciously asserted will.\nThey must contribute toward realizing a plan of life, a plan that is\nitself unified by some freely chosen aim. Such an aim and its\ncorresponding plan of life could not easily be created by an\nindividual out of the chaos of conflicting personal desires and\nimpulses that we all encounter. Rather, such aims and plans are found\nalready largely formed in social experience: we come to consciousness\nin a world that proffers countless well-defined causes and programs\nfor their accomplishment. These programs extend through time and\nrequire the contributions of many individuals for their advancement.\nWhen one judges a cause to be worthwhile and freely embraces such a\nprogram, several momentous things happen. The individual\u2019s will\nis focused and defined in terms of the shared cause. The individual\nbecomes allied with a community of others who are also committed to\nthe same cause. Finally, a morally significant commitment to the cause\nand to the community develops. This commitment is what Royce calls\n\u201cloyalty.\u201d The moral life may be understood in terms of\nthe multiple loyalties that a person exhibits.\n\nJust as the truth value of an idea is a matter of whether its intended\nobject is fulfilled in reality, the moral value of actions is a matter\nof whether they are loyal, whether they tend to fulfill the\ncommunity\u2019s intended aim. Loyalty is a necessary condition for\nmoral validity; defined narrowly, as Royce preferred, loyalty may even\nbe a sufficient condition for moral validity. Royce\u2019s narrow\ndefinition of loyalty, of \u201ctrue loyalty,\u201d is intended to\nrule out loyalty to morally evil causes and the communities that serve\nthem. Royce observed that the highest moral achievements throughout\nhistory have involved individuals\u2019 loyalty to ideals that\npromote the formation and expansion of communities of loyalty. Many of\nthe worst deeds have also involved a high degree of loyalty, but this\nloyalty is directed exclusively to a particular group and is expressed\nin the destruction of the conditions for others\u2019 loyal actions,\nof those other persons, and even of one\u2019s own community and\ncause. Royce generalized the difference between true loyalty and\nvicious or \u201cpredatory\u201d loyalty as follows:\n\na cause is good, not only for me, but for mankind, in so far as it is\nessentially a loyalty to loyalty, that is, an aid and a\nfurtherance of loyalty in my fellows. It is an evil cause in so far\nas, despite the loyalty that it arouses in me, it is destructive of\nloyalty in the world of my fellows. (Royce 1908 [1995, 56])\n\n\nWhile every community hopes for the accomplishment of its central\ncause, and sees that cause\u2019s fulfillment as its highest\nachievement, Royce placed particularly high emphasis on the phenomenon\nof loyalty to a lost cause. A lost cause is not in Royce\u2019s view\na hopeless cause, but rather one that cannot be fulfilled within the\nactual lifetime of the community or any of its members. Many lost\ncauses are rightly lost, of course, and there is a problematic aspect\nto Royce\u2019s use of this term. Royce\u2019s contemporaries would have\nunderstood \u201cthe lost cause\u201d as a reference to \u201cthe mythology of\npre-Civil War southern society,\u201d a romanticized view of the\nConfederate States\u2019 defense of slavery and segregation in the\nU.S. Civil War (Fischer 2012, 32). Royce identified military action as\nan example of predatory loyalty, however, so his veiled reference to\nthe lost cause of the Confederacy is a very poor example of loyalty.\nBesides such misguided \u201cevil causes,\u201d though, there are a number of\nlegitimate causes that are, by this definition, \u201clost\u201d\nsimply in virtue of their scope and magnitude. Such causes are not\nhopeless, however. It is precisely these causes that establish ideals\ncapable of evoking our highest hope and moral commitment.\n\nChief among these are the universal causes of the full attainment of\ntruth, the complete determination of the nature of reality through\ninquiry and interpretation, and of the establishment of universal\nloyalty to loyalty itself. In practice, the formula of \u201cloyalty\nto loyalty\u201d demands that one\u2019s moral and intellectual\nsphere become ever broader and remain critical at all levels. All the\ncommunities we actually know, those we inhabit and identify with, are\nfinite and to some degree \u201cpredatory\u201d in Royce\u2019s\nsense. This is clearly true of small social cliques, isolated\nintellectual communities, parochial religious groups, self-interested\nunions and corporations, local political movements, and other such\ngroups. Roycean loyalty requires one to scrutinze the aims and actions\nof such communities and to work to reform their disloyal aspects. The\nphilosophy of loyalty calls us first of all, then, to create and\nembrace more cosmopolitan and inclusionary communities. It should be\nclear that this is only the first important step of an infinite\nprocess aimed at realizing the ideal of universal loyalty. Any actual\ncommunity, whether it be the United Nations or a bickering family,\nwill in fact fall short of perfect loyalty. When it does so, each must\nanswer to the same critical scrutiny and calls for reform. There is no\nexpectation that these high ideals of perfect loyalty, truth and\nreality will ever be fully realized. These \u201clost causes\u201d\nare indispensable, in Royce\u2019s view, as the source of absolute\nnorms for any community and its members.\n\nRoyce maintained that the logic of volition, pursued far enough,\ncompels us to embrace precisely these lost causes as our own. In the\ncourse of his extended debate with James over the adequacy of\npragmatism as a doctrine, Royce came to accept many of James\u2019s\nprinciples. One, inspired by James\u2019s well-known essay \u201cThe\nWill to Believe,\u201d is that any philosophical view is at bottom an\nexpression of individual volition. Given the fact of our existence in\nthe world, we must first decide how we are to approach that world, and\nthen develop our philosophical theories accordingly. A second\nprinciple that Royce adopted is the pragmatist view of truth: truth is\nthe property possessed by those ideas that succeed in the long run.\nRoyce\u2019s main disagreements with other versons of pragmatism\nconcern the way these two principles are typically understood. Royce\nmaintained that although there are several possible attitudes of the\nwill that one might adopt toward the world (including\nSchopenhauer\u2019s \u201cwill to live\u201d and its opposite,\nresignation) only one \u2014 loyalty to the ideal of an ultimate\ntruth \u2014 is correct. The other possible attitudes of the will are\nself-refuting. He accordingly referred to his own position as\n\u201cAbsolute Voluntarism\u201d (Royce 1913 [2001, 349]). Royce\noffered a similar argument concerning the pragmatist notion of truth\n(Royce 1913 [2001, 279]). Explicitly adopting one of Peirce\u2019s\nconcepts, Royce argues that to define truth using any conception of\n\u201cthe long run\u201d \u2014 short of the ideal end of inquiry\n\u2014 is self-refuting. Given the apparent finality of this argument\n(which is, again, a variation of the Argument from Error) Royce called\nhis position \u201cAbsolute Pragmatism.\u201d\n\nRoyce\u2019s philosophy of loyalty resembles existentialism in\ncertain respects. Notable among these are the notions that we come to\nmoral awareness in a world of already established aims and social\nprojects, that moral responsibility requires a self-conscious and\ndeliberate individual choice to embrace particular causes, and that\nthe highest forms of ethical conduct involve dedication and effort in\nservice of a cause that offers no promise of final success. Royce\ndiffers from later existentialists such as Camus and Sartre, however,\nin several important respects. Royce would not accept their notion\nthat human efforts are finally absurd, unfolding against a backdrop of\na meaningless and indifferent universe. On the contrary, Royce\nmaintained that the concepts of ultimate meaning and reality are\npowerful and legitimate forces in our lives. With existentialism,\nRoyce recognized the very real chasms that separate one person\u2019s\nfeelings, thoughts, and will from another: the experience of another\nmay be inscrutable. At the same time, though, he insisted that we\nacknowledge the equally important fact that in ordinary social life\nminds frequently do work in concert. Groups of people often are\nunified in feeling, thought, and will by something that transcends any\nof the individuals present (Royce 1913 [2001, 239]).\n2.2.2 Theory of Community\n\nRoyce was one of the first American philosophers to recognize the\nimportant challenge of Nietzsche\u2019s moral vision, which\ncelebrates those individuals who seek to exercise their autonomous\nwill to a \u201csocially idealized\u201d power. Such heroic\nindividualism, also associated with Walt Whitman, Ralph Waldo Emerson,\nand William James, proves unsatisfactory in Royce\u2019s view (Royce\n1908 [1995, 41]). Their inspiring ethical visions are doomed to\nineffectiveness precisely because of their extreme individualism.\n\u201cThere is only one way to be an ethical individual. That is to\nchoose your cause, and then to serve it, as the Samurai his feudal\nchief, as the ideal knight of romantic story his lady, \u2014 in the\nspirit of all the loyal\u201d (Royce 1908 [1995, 47]). These\nparticular examples are meant to illustrate the essentially social\ncharacter of loyalty in general: \u201cMy life means nothing, either\ntheoretically or practically, unless I am a member of a\ncommunity\u201d (Royce 1913 [2001, 357]).\n\nOne of the more striking features of Royce\u2019s philosophy is its\nemphasis on communities as being logically prior to individuals. As we\nhave seen, Royce considered the notions of truth and knowledge\nunintelligible for the individual unless we posit an ultimate knower\nof objective truth, the infinite community of minds. The notions of\npersonal identity and purpose are likewise unintelligible unless we\nposit a community of persons that defines causes and establishes\nsocial roles for those individuals to embrace. The concept of\ncommunity is thus central both to Royce\u2019s ethics and his\nmetaphysics. Not just any association or collection of individuals is\na community. Community can only exist where individual members are in\ncommunication with one another so that there is, to some extent and in\nsome relevant respect, a congruence of feeling, thought, and will\namong them. It is also necessary to consider the temporal dimensions\nof community. \u201cA community constituted by the fact that each of\nits members accepts as a part of his own individual life and self the\nsame past events that each of his fellow-members accepts, may\nbe called a community of memory.\u201d Similarly, \u201cA\ncommunity constituted by the fact that each of its members accepts, as\npart of his own individual life and self, the same expected\nfuture events that each of his fellows accepts, may be called\na community of expectation or\u2026a community of\nhope\u201d (PC 248). These common past and future events, which\nall members hold as identical parts of their own lives, are the basis\nof their loyalty to the community.\n\nAs discussed in connection with Royce\u2019s ethical theory, some\ncommunities are defined by true loyalty, or adherence to a cause that\nharmonizes with the universal ideal of \u201cloyalty to\nloyalty.\u201d He referred to such communities as \u201cgenuine\ncommunities\u201d or \u201ccommunities of grace.\u201d Other\ncommunities are defined by a vicious or predatory loyalty. These\ndegenerate \u201cnatural communities\u201d tend toward the\ndestruction of others\u2019 causes and possibilities of loyalty.\nFinally, beyond the actual communities that we directly encounter in\nlife there is the ideal \u201cBeloved Community\u201d of all those\nwho would be fully dedicated to the cause of loyalty, truth and\nreality itself.\n\nRoyce stressed that the sharing of individuals\u2019 feelings,\nthoughts, and wills that occurs in any community (including the\nBeloved Community) should not be taken to imply a mystical blurring or\nannihilation of personal identities. Individuals remain individuals,\nbut in forming a community they attain to a kind of second-order life\nthat extends beyond any of their individual lives. Where a number of\nindividuals\u2019 loyalty to a cause is coordinated in community over\ntime, Royce spoke non-figuratively of a super-human personality at\nwork: a genuine community is united by a guiding or\n\u201cinterpreting spirit.\u201d The interpreting spirit may on\noccasion be embodied by a single person such as a leader or other\nexemplar, but this is not always the case.\n2.3 Philosophy of Religion\n\nThough his writings contain a great deal of insight that is relevant\nfor a strictly naturalistic philosophy, religious concerns figure\nprominently from Royce\u2019s first major publication, The\nReligious Aspect of Philosophy, to his last two, The Sources\nof Religious Insight and The Problem of Christianity. As\nhas been indicated, the main focus of Royce\u2019s early work was\nmetaphysical. In The World and the Individual he plainly\nidentified the object of his inquiry as \u201cthe Individual of\nIndividuals, namely the Absolute, or God himself\u201d (Royce\n1899\u20131901, 1:40). Critics of Royce\u2019s early works admired\nhis metaphysical argumentation but found his conception of God\nwanting. Peirce observed that the Absolute Mind bore little\nresemblance to the God that people seek in churches \u2014 it is not\nthe kind of being anyone would worship. James objected that if all our\nerrors and sorrows are in fact reconciled in the Absolute, then finite\npersons would seem to be exonerated from ultimate responsibility for\ntheir actions: they might as well enjoy a lifelong \u201cmoral\nholiday.\u201d With The Philosophy of Loyalty Royce began to\ndevote more attention to the practical questions of ethics and the\nphilosophy of community. In his last works he drew upon the notion of\nloyalty to explain the nature of religious experience in human\ncommunities.\n\nRoyce stated that \u201cthe central and essential postulate\u201d of\nevery religion is that \u201cman needs to be saved\u201d (Royce 1912\n[2001, 8\u20139]). Salvation is necessary because of a combination of\ntwo factors. The first is \u201cthe idea that there is some aim or\nend of human life which is more important than all other aims.\u201d\nThe second is that \u201cman as he now is, or as he naturally is, is\nin great danger of so missing this highest aim as to render his whole\nlife a senseless failure\u201d (Royce 1912 [2001, 12]). Salvation\ncomes in the form of guidance toward understanding and accomplishing\nthe highest aim of life, so far as we are able. Given the limitations\nand fallibility of the human perspective, Royce maintained that this\nguidance must come from some super-human or divine source. Religion is\nthe sphere of life in which finite human beings are able to get into\ntouch with this divine source of wisdom and guidance.\n\nIn The Sources of Religious Insight Royce considered and\nrejected several common conceptions of religion before making his case\nfor a religion of loyalty. His discussion of natural social\nlife as a source of religious insight may be read as a critique\nof the \u201cSocial Gospel\u201d movement. His consideration of\nreason is notable not for its familiar observation that\nreason is inadequate to religious knowledge, but for his pragmatist\ncritique of the adequacy of mere reason even for scientific knowledge.\nFinally, his careful consideration and rejection of\nindividualism in religion is a direct critique of the\nJamesean view of religious experience. Royce employed his familiar\ndialectical method to make his case for religious insight through\nparticipation in the loyal community, the \u201cinvisible\nchurch\u201d guided by a divine spirit and devoted to the highest\nideals of goodness. In the Sources Royce offered a view of\nreligion as common experience. It is \u201ccommon\u201d both in the\nsense that it does not consist primarily of the kind of extraordinary\nexperiences that James emphasized, and in the sense that it is a\nfundamentally social rather than individual experience of reality.\n2.3.1 Christianity\n\nWhile the Sources concerns the nature of religious experience\nin general, The Problem of Christianity focuses on the\nquestion \u201cIn what sense, if any, can the modern man consistently\nbe, in creed, a Christian?\u201d (Royce 1913 [2001, 62]).\nRoyce\u2019s answer actually rejects the sort of static concepts and\nbeliefs usually implied by devotion to specific creeds, including\nthose identified with Christianity. While his view pivots on the\nChristian notion of divine incarnation, it is not the incarnation of\nGod in Jesus but rather the incarnation of the Spirit in the living\nchurch that Royce emphasized: \u201cthe Church, rather than the\nperson of the founder, ought to be viewed as the central idea of\nChristianity\u201d (Royce 1913 [2001, 43]). The Christian\nchurch\u2019s primary importance, for Royce, is as a paradigm of\ncommunity. He regarded the Pauline church as the best exemplar of a\ngraced community: at its best, the church strives to embody the\nguiding Interpreter Spirit, so as to become a Universal Community of\nInterpretation \u201cwhose life comprises and unifies all the social\nvarieties and all the social communities which\u2026we know to be\nreal\u201d (Royce 1913 [2001, 340]). Doctrines and creeds may change;\nthe particular institutions that identify themselves as churches may\nor may not actually be communities of grace. What matters in the end\nis the process of interpretation \u2014 the process of communicating\nand understanding one another in actual, imperfect, finite communities\nof grace bound together by loyalty and striving toward the ultimate\nand ideal Beloved Community.\n\nRoyce was critical of many historical churches because they had in his\nview lost sight of the spirit that ought to guide them. At the same\ntime, he identified grace at work in many communities that were not\nself-consciously religious. He had great respect for non-Christian\nreligions, paying especially careful attention to Buddhism (Royce took\nthe trouble to learn Sanskrit, and The Problem of\nChristianity includes a very sympathetic presentation of\nBuddhism). In the end, however, Royce was a philosopher who worked\nwithin the intellectual context of Western Christianity. He maintained\nthat only the Christian model of the loyal community successfully\ncombines the true spirit of universal interpretation with an\nappreciation of the \u201cinfinite worth\u201d of the individual as\na unique member of the ideal Beloved Community, the Kingdom of Heaven\n(Royce 1913 [2001, 193]).\n2.3.2 The Problem of Evil\n\nThe problem of evil is a persistent theme throughout Royce\u2019s\nwritings. He struggled with tragedy in his personal life and sought to\nunderstand it better through philosophy. As an idealist he also had to\nstruggle with evil as a problem of metaphysics. Idealism maintains\nthat all deeds and events are ultimately taken up and reconciled in a\nfinal perspective. This seems to suggest that the evil, sorrow, and\npain that run through human life are illusory \u2014 or what seems\neven less comprehensible, that our experience of suffering is somehow\ngood, that it is \u201call for the best.\u201d While some idealists\nhave accepted these apparent implications of their metaphysics, Royce\nmaintained that evil is a real fact of the world. He insisted that we\nconfront evil as evil and not regard it as a means to attain\na preordained but inscrutable Divine purpose. He sought to understand\nevil philosophically. In seeking that understanding he was not content\nto explain it away or to salve its effects by appealing to a clever\ntheodicy.\n\nRoyce embraced a theistic process metaphysics that recognizes evil as\na real force and suffering as an irreducible fact of experience. In\n\u201cThe Problem of Job\u201d Royce addressed the traditional\nproblem of evil: \u201cGrant Job\u2019s own presupposition that God\nis a being other than this world, that he is its external creator and\nruler, and then all solutions fail. God is either then cruel or\nhelpless, as regards all finite ill of the sort that Job\nendures.\u201d If we consider that God is not a separate being, then\n\u201cWhen you suffer, your sufferings are God\u2019s\nsufferings, not his external work, not his external penalty, not the\nfruit of his neglect, but identically his own personal woe. In you God\nhimself suffers, precisely as you do, and has all your concern in\novercoming this grief.\u201d Grief is not \u201ca physical means to\nan external end,\u201d but rather \u201ca logically necessary and\neternal constituent of the divine life\u201d (McDermott 1969, 843).\nThough Royce believed that events are collectively tending toward an\nultimate reconciliation in the eternal perspective of the Beloved\nCommunity, they are not erased even in that ideal perspective. The\nevents of life (joyful and sorrowful alike) persist, both as\nexperiences of the individuals who undergo them and also as\nGod\u2019s own experiences.\n\nRoyce did not seek to explain away or lessen the reality of evil: it\nis in his view a brute fact of being, an inevitable result of the\nworld\u2019s existence in time. Given the fact of evil, the most\nimportant question concerns how we finite beings ought to respond to\nit. His answer was that we should adopt the attitude of loyalty to\ngoodness and truth, which as real forces in the world are the\nmetaphysical opposite of evil. The loyal member of a genuine community\nconfronts evil and wills to overcome it through the very fact of\nloyalty to its opposite. Evil can never be eradicated \u2014 this is\nanother way of saying that loyalty to loyalty is a lost cause. Though\nthe success of this high cause lies in the unreachable\nfuture, the meaning of our response is manifest in our\npresent lives.\n\nRoyce\u2019s powerful and original explanation of the doctrine of\natonement in The Problem of Christianity details how the\nloyal community can best respond to human evil. The highest kind of\ntransgression in an ethics of loyalty is treason, or the willful\nbetrayal of one\u2019s own cause and the community of people who\nserve it. The traitor is one who has freely embraced a cause and\njoined with a community of grace in service of that cause, but who\nthen culpably commits some act that undermines the cause and the\ncommunity. Such a betrayal is but one step away from moral suicide: it\nthreatens to destroy the network of purposes and concrete social\nrelationships that define the traitor\u2019s self (Royce 1913 [2001,\n162]). Atonement occurs when the traitor and the community are\nreconciled, when they are both saved from the evil deed through some\nact of the will.\n\nRoyce found traditional Christian accounts of atonement\nunsatisfactory. They do not adequately explain how both the traitor\nand the community are reconciled and saved in the human sphere. Much\nless do they explain the mysterious details of how atonement\nreconciles the sinner with God. The traitor who recognizes the\nmagnitude of what has been lost through the act of betrayal lives in a\nstate that Royce called \u201cthe hell of the irrevocable\u201d\n(Royce 1913 [2001, 162]). Royce sought an explanation of atonement\nthat acknowledges the irrevocable nature of a deed that has been done,\nand which changes everything for the sinner and the community that has\nbeen harmed. \u201cPenal satisfaction\u201d theories of atonement\nsimply do not speak to the sinner\u2019s situation: to be told that\nan angry God demands repayment or retribution for the betrayal, and\nthat this price has been paid (by the violent death of Jesus Christ,\nor by any other sacrifice) does not repair the sinner\u2019s own\ndevastated moral universe. The sinner \u201cis dealing, not with the\n\u2018angry God\u2019 of a well-known theological tradition, but\nwith himself\u201d (Royce 1913 [2001, 170\u201371]). Royce seeks a\ntheory that first makes sense of the immediate human aspect of\natonement. If one can be found, it may then be considered\ntheologically. A theory of \u201cpenal satisfaction,\u201d which\nclaims to answer theological questions, but remains meaningless or\nmysterious in human terms, is simply unsatisfactory.\n\nThe concrete human evil of treason is that the traitor\u2019s loyalty\nto the cause, and with it the moral relations that bound the community\ntogether, have been broken and cannot be restored to their previous\nstate. \u201cMoral theories\u201d of atonement account for change in\nthe traitor\u2019s person but fail to explain how the \u201cwounded\nor shattered community\u201d can be repaired (Royce 1913 [2001,\n175]). Such theories, in Royce\u2019s account, explain that in\ncontemplating Christ\u2019s willing sacrifice of his own life for the\nsake of the human community, the sinner experiences deep repentance\nand develops a new capacity for love of the betrayed community. The\nsinner\u2019s soul is purified and made better (Royce 1913 [2001,\n172]). Such a process may bring the sinner to realize the hellish\nmagnitude of irrevocable treason. Royce pointed out, though, that such\na process by itself does nothing to reconcile the sinner to the\ncommunity or to repair that community. Such reconciliation and healing\nrequires something more than a change in the individual\u2019s\nheart.\n\nThis brought Royce to consider theories of atonement that center upon\nthe community\u2019s act of forgiveness. Forgiveness, as an act of\nthe community and not the sinner, is clearly essential to atonement.\nMoreover, it involves a recognition of human frailty \u2014 not just\nthe moral frailty of the sinner in question, but that of all humans.\nForgiveness involves a recognition that anyone might commit such an\nact, that the cause of perfect loyalty is a lost cause. Even when it\ncan occur, though, forgiveness does not restore the community to the\ninnocent state of harmony and \u201cunscarred love\u201d that\nexisted before the betrayal (Royce 1913 [2001, 177\u201378]).\nAtonement moves the community and the traitor beyond the irrevocable\ndeed of betrayal. This cannot be done by an act of forgiveness that\nreturns the community and its relations to the way things were before.\n\u201cThe way things were\u201d is irrevocably gone.\n\nIn its human aspect atonement occurs through an interpretive act that\ncreates new relationships among the members, including the traitor,\ntogether with a new understanding and fresh embracing of their\nunifying cause. The act of atonement \u201ccan only be accomplished\nby the community, or on behalf of the community, through some\nsteadfastly loyal servant who acts, so to speak, as the incarnation of\nthe spirit of the community itself\u201d (Royce 1913 [2001, 180]).\nThis person acts as a mediating third party between the traitor and\nthe betrayed community. Things are not made the same as they were\nbefore through atonement, but are in an important respect made better\n\u2014 precisely because of the unique circumstances created by the\noriginal act of treason. Through the atoning act genuine community is\nrestored and all the individuals involved may emerge as wiser, more\nresolved servants of their common cause. In this sense, Royce wrote,\n\u201cThe world, as transformed by this creative deed, is better\nthan it would have been had all else remained the same, but had that\ndeed of treason not been done at all\u201d (Royce 1913 [2001,\n180]).\n\nRoyce indicated that this insight about the human aspect of atonement\nprovides the basis for a theological understanding of the atonement\ninvolved in Christ\u2019s teachings and death. He did not himself\narticulate the details of a theological doctrine of atonement,\nhowever. He stated \u201cthe central postulate\u201d of \u201cthe\nhighest form of human spirituality\u201d as follows: \u201cNo\nbaseness or cruelty of treason so deep or so tragic shall enter our\nhuman world, but that loyal love shall be able in due time to oppose\nto just that deed of treason its fitting deed of atonement\u201d\n(Royce 1913 [2001, 186]). This postulate cannot be proved true, of\ncourse, but human communities can assert it and act upon it as if it\nwere true. Christian doctrine, as Royce presents it, takes this same\npostulate as \u201ca report concerning the supernatural works of\nChrist\u201d (Royce 1913 [2001, 186]). In The Problem of\nChristianity Royce had set out to answer the question \u201cIn\nwhat sense, if any, can the modern man consistently be, in creed, a\nChristian?\u201d One form of his answer, based on this theory of\natonement, is that communities can and should act upon the faith that,\nthrough the spirit of genuine community, atonement is always possible\nas a response to human sin and evil.\n2.4. Race\n\nIn 1908 Royce published a collection of essays entitled Race\nQuestions, Provincialism, and Other American Problems. The key\nessay, \u201cRace Questions and Prejudices,\u201d had appeared in\nthe International Journal of Ethics in 1906. This established\nRoyce as one of the most prominent white philosophers of his time to\naddress racial prejudice, drawing upon the leading ethnological\nresearch of his day. Royce\u2019s philosophy enters debates about race in\nanother important way, as well. Martin Luther King, Jr. adapted\nRoyce\u2019s concept of the Beloved Community\u2014which King had likely\nlearned through his mentor, Howard W. Thurman\u2014as an important\nrhetorical and visionary ideal for the U. S. civil rights movement\n(Jensen and King \n 2017).[1]\n\nThis history suggested Royce\u2019s philosophy as a promising source for\ncontemporary dialogues about race and community. Scholars including\nJacquelyn Kegley and Shannon Sullivan have proposed models of\negalitarian, anti-racist Roycean \u201cgenuine communities\u201d (See Kegley\n1997, and Sullivan\u2019s introduction to Royce 1908 [2009].) Tommy J.\nCurry has argued, however, that Royce\u2019s philosophy is tainted by\nracist ideas: it does not have a progressive vision of social justice\nor of resisting anti-Black racism (Curry 2018). The debate over racist\nelements in Royce\u2019s philosophy has been\nextensive.[2]\nBeyond its implications for our appraisal and use of Royce\u2019s work, the\ncontroversy illustrates the challenges contemporary scholars face when\nconfronting ugly facts about the historical figures they study. Here\nwe will survey the concerns that have been raised about apparent\nanti-Black and colonial themes in Royce\u2019s work. Such a survey may help\noutline considerations that are relevant for scholars addressing other\nproblematic figures.\n\nIt is common to dismiss objectionable features of a past\nthinker\u2019s work under the excuse that \u201ceveryone is a\nproduct of their times,\u201d and thus cannot be fairly judged for\nembracing views and language that were then widely accepted. The\npresumption is that we can excise the objectionable elements, while\nstill carrying the main ideas forward.  On this view, we can excuse\nthe objectionable parts as something like incidental errors, which can\nbe corrected without affecting the substance of what was written. Such\nelements should be identified and placed in context but, unlike mere\ntypographical errors, the offending material should be fully\nacknowledged and not merely erased.\n\nRoyce\u2019s use of the phrase \u201clost cause\u201d in explaining\nthe concept of loyalty can perhaps be treated in this manner. While\nthe phrase does carry the baggage of reference to a mythical vision of\nthe racist and sexist Confederacy (Fischer 2012, 32), it is not\nrestricted to that reference. People embrace many admirable\n\u201clost causes,\u201d in the sense that their causes can never be\nperfectly fulfilled. These communities and their causes can serve as\nexemplars of Roycean loyalty; explicitly rejecting the problematic\nLost Cause of the Confederacy as one of these does not affect\nRoyce\u2019s\n point.[3]\nThat he chose \u201cThe Lost Cause\u201d and the decision by Robert\nE. Lee to defend the Confederacy as positive exemplars of loyalty can\nbe challenged on Royce\u2019s own principles\u2014Royce elsewhere\nexplicitly rejected the \u201cdisastrous\u201d association of\nloyalty with warfare (1995 [1908], 7\u20138). The fact that he failed\nto do so can be seen both as a useful warning to philosophers who fail\nto be adequately critical of their own commitments, and as further\nevidence that loyalty is a useful concept in understanding moral\ncommitments and where they can go wrong.\n\nA much greater concern arises when it is clear that a figure embraced\nobjectionable views, acted upon them and included them as elements of\ntheir philosophy. Curry and others have shown that Royce did embrace\nseveral problematic positions. Royce was indeed ahead of many others\nin rejecting biological or \u201cscientific\u201d racism, and with\nit the view that ostensible \u201cracial characteristics\u201d are\nfixed or essential. He instead embraced a form of cultural racism in\nwhich white civilization, and especially Anglo-American\ncivilization,[4]\nwas considered superior to Black, Asian, and other racial/cultural\nsocieties. Accordingly, Royce assumed that the ideal \u201cbeloved\ncommunity\u201d would emerge from the Anglo-American culture of the\nlate 19th century, and would develop in a way that reflects\nAnglo-American principles, values, and institutions. Royce maintained\nthat racial characteristics arise from environment and culture; under\ndifferent influences, then, different characteristics will\ndevelop. This assumption led Royce to regard British colonialism as a\n\u201ccivilizing\u201d force rather than an oppressive one, and to\nadvocate for a similar imposition of civilizing administrative\nmeasures in the American south. It led him to assume that foreigners\nand non-white people ought to be assimilated into Anglo-American\ncommunities; he did not entertain the possibility that they might\ndevelop genuine communities built on their own history and\nculture. Finally, it led him to advocate for a \u201cwise\nprovincialism\u201d in which different communities reflect the\ndistinctive culture and history of their members. Such a model does\nacknowledge the importance of diversity and pluralism, but Royce seems\nto have thought that this diversity would be constrained within the\ncore Anglo-American values and institutions to which everyone had\nalready been assimilated. This limited provincial diversity thus\napparently arose not from respect for the value of different cultures,\nbut from a need to maintain order by not appearing intolerably\noppressive (Curry 2018, 27).\n\nWe ought not to read Royce\u2019s rejection of scientific racism as a\ncomplete rejection of racist ideas. We must recognize his praise of\ncolonialist models of governance, and his account of the way\ncommunities ought to receive newcomers, as arising from racist\nassumptions. It is necessary to acknowledge these problematic\nassumptions in his work. Anyone who wishes to apply Royce\u2019s\nphilosophy to contemporary problems must understand why he included\nthese assumptions, and, if possible, avoid them in their own\nthinking.\n\nFinally, we must consider whether Royce\u2019s version of white\nsupremacist thinking is a necessary structural element in his\nphilosophy. Curry has established that to overlook these assumptions\nis to present an inaccurate representation of what Royce actually\nthought, and of why he thought it. It is not clear, however, that one\nwould need to retain any of these assumptions in developing a\ncontemporary theory of community, metaphysics, religion, or logic that\ndraws on Royce\u2019s work (Pratt 2014 and 2021). In principle it may\nbe possible to develop an anti-racist vision of community based on\nRoycean principles (Tunstall 2021, 28\u201329; Jackson 2021,\n68\u201370; Barnette 2021, 102\u201304). Royce conceived the Beloved\nCommunity as an ideal unified around a common set of\nloyalties. Racist, militaristic, nationalistic, and other\n\u201cpredatory\u201d loyalties would be eliminated in the\nhistorical emergence of this community, and it would retain\ncontributions from many distinctive cultures (Jackson 2021,\n63). Moving beyond Royce\u2019s unitary ideal, we might instead\nenvision a pluralist, multicultural world that contains many kinds of\nbeloved communities. Both visions are logically possible, but whether\neither one is practically possible is not a question for\nphilosophy. This is a matter for people to work out the hard way, in\nthe complex world of history and politics, rather than in the\ndeliberately simplified realm of theory.\n3. Logic\n\nRoyce understood logic as the science of order focused on\n\u201cproblems regarding, not the methods by which a thinker\nsucceeds, nor yet the norms, but rather the Forms, the\nCategories, the Types of Order, which characterize\nany realm of objects\u201d (Royce 1913a, 69). In a variety of work\nbeginning with The World and The Individual (1900) continuing\nthrough the remainder of his life in published and unpublished papers,\nRoyce proposed a logical system with both formal and informal,\nphilosophical implications. He called his logic \u201cSystem\n\\(\\Sigma\\).\u201d\n3.1 Elements of System \\(\\Sigma\\)\n3.1.1 Modes of Action\n\nThe logic of \\(\\Sigma\\) begins, according to Royce, with the\nontological claim that the terms of the logic \u201cmay be defined\nas, \u2018certain possible modes of action that are open to any\nrational being who can act at all, and who can also reflect upon his\nown modes of possible action\u2019\u2009\u201d (1913a,\n 130\u20131).[5]\n Hence the subject matter of logic is \u201cobjects\u201d understood\nnot as fixed entities but as \u201cmodes of action.\u201d Note that\nfor Royce, a \u2018rational being\u2019 is a purposive being: that\nis, an agent understood as something capable of action toward a\npurpose. In World and the Individual he wrote: \u201cAt any\nmoment your ideas, in so far as they are rational, embody a\npurpose\u201d (1900, 441\u20132). \u201cAnd so,\u201d he said\nelsewhere, \u201cthe empirical world is a whole, a life fulfilling\nthe purposes of our ideas. It is that or it is nothing\u201d (1900,\n368). The logic that Royce proposed is therefore a logic of action\nwhere actions are taken as purposive.\n\nAs an ontological starting point, modes of action should be understood\nas \u201cgeneral\u201d terms, in the sense proposed by C. S. Peirce.\nGenerals, for Peirce, are like habits in that they specify a general\nstate of affairs that can be realized in multiple different ways\n(Peirce, 1931, 2:148). Generals stand in contrast to universals. While\nuniversals are deductively complete categories, generals are emergent\ncategories where some particulars fit closely to the features\nspecified by the general concept and others less so. The category of\noak tree, for example, can be realized by a wide range of particular\noak trees from tall, full trees, to small, stunted trees, to trees\nbroken by ice and wind. Each is, in a general sense, an oak tree, but\neach realizes the concept in a particular way. The concept of species\nis likewise general in that a species includes marginal cases that are\nnot clearly in the category or clearly out of it. While it is tempting\n(especially in the case of terms that are defined in a particular\nfield of inquiry) to suppose that categories are the nominal\nconstructs of inquirers, Peirce argued that generals are themselves\nreal (not nominal), so that natural kinds or categories are the\nproducts of evolving and intersecting activities, and as such are as\nmuch discovered as they are created for purposes of inquiry (Peirce,\n8:12; Mayorga, 2007).\n\nModes of action are similarly general. Talk about the relation between\nactions \\(A\\) and \\(B\\) is talk about\nthe relation between two general ways of acting. When \\(A\\)\nis actually taken, then it is a particular token of\nthe type of action \\(A\\) and it stands in a distinctive\nrelation with other modes of action with which it is compatible and\nstill other modes of action with which it is not. By framing his logic\nas a logic of modes of action, Royce could include both categories of\ncommonly understood actions (walking, talking, reading, judging), but\nwas also able to include any sort of persistent being by seeing a\nbeing as a process involving distinctive characteristic actions in\nrelation to general categories or modes of action. An apple is a thing\nthat acts like an apple; a mountain is a thing that acts like a\nmountain; a fine pinot noir is thing that acts like a fine pinot noir.\nThe power of this approach is that the objects of logic are\nnecessarily understood as ongoing activities that both close off\npossibilities and open new ones with each action.\n3.1.2 Fundamental Operations\n\nThe primary operation in Royce\u2019s logic is the exclusive\n disjunction[6],\n an operation or possible operation that divides actions into two\n\u201cobverse\u201d or incompatible categories where if one action\nfrom a category is taken, it eliminates the possibility of taking an\naction in the other. For example, an exclusive disjunction is present\nwhen an agent selects a candidate on a ballot. To select the candidate\nis to lose the option to choose another or to simply opt out of\nvoting. Put another way, actions are exclusively related when they are\nincompatible, that is, they cannot be taken together. Royce\u2019s\nlogic is founded on the relation that expresses the operation of\njudgment, that is, the selection by an agent of one alternative over\nanother where the alternatives are incompatible. System \\(\\Sigma\\) is\na logic of modes of action and a logic of agency.\n\nExclusively-related actions also introduce the operation of\nnegation. When an action is negated, it is not taken (or is\nexcluded from the possibility of being taken). So, if action \\(A\\)\nand action \\(B\\) are related by\nexclusive disjunction, then if action \\(A\\) is taken,\naction \\(B\\) is negated, \\(\\neg B\\).\n\nThe exclusive relation that holds between incompatible actions also\nprovides a context for Royce\u2019s notion of equivalence\n(Royce 1905, 391). An action, \\(A\\), is logically\nequivalent to another action, \\(B\\), if and only if\nthey are compatible (one can be taken without excluding the other).\nSo, for example, if \\(A\\) and \\(B\\) are\ncompatible and \\(B\\) and \\(\\neg B\\) are incompatible,\nthen \\(A\\) and \\(\\neg B\\) are also incompatible. If so,\nthen \\(A = B\\). In the case of voting just mentioned, the three-term\nrelation (voting for candidate \\(M\\), voting for\nsomeone else, and not voting at all) are together incompatible. If we\nconsider the first option, voting for \\(M\\), then the\nother two options are equivalent because they equally eliminate voting\nfor \\(M\\) if one or the other is taken. Equivalence\nthen is relative to compatibility in a given situation defined by a\nset of incompatible or \u201cobverse\u201d possibilities.\n\nExclusive disjunction and equivalence suggest two other basic\nrelations among actions: symmetry and asymmetry (Royce 1905,\n379\u2013385; 1913a, 97\u2013100). Exclusive disjunctions are\nsymmetrical in that their order in relation to the disjunctive terms\ndoes not matter. That is, if \\(A\\) or \\(\\neg A\\) is an\nexclusive disjunction, then \\(\\neg A\\) or \\(A\\) is\nalso. Equivalence is also symmetrical in that if \\(A\\)\nand \\(B\\) are equivalent, then \\(B\\) and\n\\(A\\) are also equivalent. In either case, the actions\nare not ordered with respect to each other. When actions are ordered\nsuch that \\(A\\) is antecedent to \\(B\\)\n(or vice versa), then the relation is asymmetrical.\n\nIn general, the process of ordering is a twofold transformation.\nPossibilities of action emerge as symmetrical exclusive disjunctions\nand are transformed into asymmetrical relations such that one action\nis antecedent to the other. If \\(A\\) or \\(B\\)\nis an exclusive disjunction, then taking action \\(A\\)\nresults in the negation of action \\(B\\),\nsuch that \\(\\neg B\\) is a consequence of the\nantecedent taking of \\(A\\). The symmetrical exclusive\ndisjunction is transformed by the action of an agent into the\nasymmetrical antecedent/consequent relation.\n3.2 The Basic Relations of System \\(\\Sigma\\)\n\nGiven exclusive disjunction, equivalence, symmetry, and asymmetry,\nRoyce proposed that such relations could be expressed as a single\nordering relation, the obverse or \\(O\\)-relation.[7]\n Represented \u2018\\(O(A \\: B)\\)\u2019, the \\(O\\)-relation\nmarks two possible courses or modes of\naction, \\(A\\) and \\(B\\), and indicates\nthat these courses of action are incompatible: that is, \\(O(A\\: B)\\)\ncan be read as the assertion that action A and action B cannot both be\ntaken or that if \\(A\\) is taken \\(B\\)\ncannot be taken and vice versa. \\(O\\)-relations\nsimultaneously represent a state of affairs such that two possible\ncourses of action are available, one of which can be actualized and\nthe other excluded. \\(O\\)-relations are also such that,\nin the course of things, one of the disjuncts must be taken. If\n\\(O(A\\: B)\\), then it is also the case that \u201cneither\u201d is\nnot an option in just the way that \u201cneither\u201d is not an\noption for \\(O(A \\: \\neg A)\\). The \\(O\\)-relation can\ninclude as many terms as are, when taken together, incompatible and,\nregardless of the number of terms, they may still be reduced to the\ndyad \\(O(a \\:\\neg a)\\). Taken as a set of incompatible actions, \\(O(A\n\\: B)\\) is an \\(O\\)-collection (Royce 1905,\n390), as are \\(O(A\\: B\\: C)\\) and \\(O(A\\: B\\: C\\: \\ldots \\: n)\\). Now\nif \\(A\\) and \\(B\\) are incompatible (and\nso then are \\(\\neg A\\) and \\(\\neg B\\)), it is also the case that\n\\(\\neg A\\) and \\(B\\) are compatible as are \\(\\neg B\\)\nand \\(A\\). These terms are then related by the\ncompatibility relation, equivalence, or the \\(E\\)-relation\n(Royce 1905, 390\u2013391) such\nthat \\(E(\\neg A\\: B)\\) and \\(E(A \\:\\neg B)\\).\n\nRoyce summarized the central ontological claims of his system this\nway: \u201cwhatever else the world contains, if it only contains a\nreasonable being who knows and intends his own acts, then this being\nis aware of a certain relation, the relation between performing and\nnot performing any act which he considers in advance of action. And\nthus relations amongst acts are in such wise necessary facts, that\nwhoever acts at all, or whoever, even in ideal, contemplates\npossible courses of action, must regard at least some of\nthese relations as present in the realm of his conceived modes of\naction\u201d (1913a, 120\u20131. When Royce introduced the\nformal system \\(\\Sigma\\) in his 1905 paper, \u201cThe Relation of the\nPrinciples of Logic to the Foundations of Geometry,\u201d he proposed\nsix \u201claws\u201d to which \\(O\\)-collections must\nconform. Restated, these six laws are as follows:\n\nIf \\(O(\\alpha )\\) then \\(O(\\alpha \\: \\beta )\\), whatever actions\n\\(b\\) includes.\nIf \\(\\beta \\) is a collection of elements that are all complements\nof some other collection \\(\\delta \\) and \\(O(\\beta)\\), then\n \\(O(\\delta)\\).[8]\nThere exists at least one element of \\(\\Sigma\\).\nIf an element \\(x\\) of \\(\\Sigma\\) exists, then \\(y\\) exists such\nthat \\(x \\ne y\\).\nIf \\(A \\ne B\\) (and so incompatible or \\(O(A\\: B)\\)), then there\nexists another element or action, \\(C\\), such that\n\\(E(A\\: C)\\) and \\(E(B\\: C)\\) and \\(O(A\\: B\\: C)\\).\nFor some set of actions, \\(\\lambda\\), and action \\(A\\)\nsuch that \\(O(\\lambda \\: A)\\), there exists another\naction \\(B\\) such that \\(O(\\lambda\\: B)\\) and that for\nany element of \\(\\lambda\\), such as \\(1_n\\), \\(O(A\\: B\\: 1_n )\\).\n\n\nThe six laws are offered by Royce as postulates, but they are intended\nto provide both relational and ontological parameters for ordering.\nThe first two laws establish the existence of exclusive disjunctions\nwhich are necessary for a world in which there are agents. Laws three\nand four establish that the universe is such that it includes a\nprinciple of generation or emergence\u2014there is at least one\nthing, and if there is one thing there are infinitely many\n more.[9]\n The fifth and sixth laws stipulate the constraints on emergent\nactions. The fifth law establishes paradoxical objects that, while\ncompatible with two different incompatible objects, are not compatible\nwith these objects when taken together. Likewise, the sixth law\nestablished that \\(O\\)-collections also generate new\nobjects or terms that extend the possibilities included in a given\nO-collection. The six laws provide the generative landscape in which\nagents emerge and operate. They also reinforce the idea that agency is\npredicated on both selecting possibilities and losing them permanently\nso that agency, whatever else it involves, entails both opportunity\nand\n sacrifice.[10]\n\nSystem \\(\\Sigma\\) then is the process of transforming symmetrically\nrelated possibilities to asymmetrical ordered action through the\nnegation of some possible action(s). In most general terms, this\nallows us to think of \\(O\\)-relations as modal and\nconditional. If the \\(O\\)-relation holds of actions \\(A\\)\nand \\(B\\), then it is the case that if\n\\(A\\) is negated (not taken or sacrificed) then \\(B\\)\nfollows. Rather than being a material conditional\n\\((\\neg A \\supset B)\\), the antecedent and consequent are necessarily\nrelated. If \\(O(A\\: B)\\) then \\(\\Box (A \\supset \\neg B)\\) and \\(\\Box\n(\\neg A \\supset\n B)\\).[11]\n Consequently, the dyadic \\(O\\)-relation, \\(O(A\\: B)\\)\ncan also be represented as \\(\\Box (A \\equiv \\neg B)\\) and so as \\(\\Box\n(A \\supset \\neg B) \\wedge \\Box (B \\supset \\neg A)\\). Given the\nequivalence relation, it follows that \\(B\\) is\nequivalent to \\(\\neg A\\) and so can be substituted for \\(B\\)\nso that \\(O(A\\: \\neg A)\\) and \\(\\Box (A \\equiv \\neg\n\\neg A)\\). \\(O\\)-relations, however, are not limited to\ndyadic relations. Consider three possible courses of action such that\ntaking any one requires the elimination of the other two courses of\naction (for example, selecting one of three paths at a fork in the\nroad). This situation can be represented as \\(O(A\\: B\\: C)\\). Note\nthat if \\(A\\) is taken, then neither \\(B\\)\nor \\(C\\) can be taken so that\ntogether, \\((B \\lor C)\\) is equivalent to \\(\\neg A\\). Likewise, if \\(B\\)\nis taken, then \\((A \\lor C)\\) is equivalent to \\(\\neg\nB\\) and so on. So \\(O(A\\: B\\: C)\\) is also \n\n\\[ \\Box [(A \\equiv \\neg (B \\lor C)) \\wedge (B \\equiv \\neg (A \\lor C)) \\wedge (C \\equiv \\neg (A \\lor B))] \\]\n\n\nHowever, since the fifth law allows that every pair of incompatible\nactions generates a third term making the initial dyadic \\(O\\)-relation\na triadic \\(O\\)-relation,\nconditional relations require an additional relation that represents\nboth the compatibility of the resulting terms and the asymmetrical\norder created. Royce proposes the F-relation for this purpose. An \\(F\\)-relation\n(like the symmetrical \\(E\\)-relation)\nrepresents the terms of the original \\(O\\)-relation\nmodified so that they are\n compatible.[12]\n It also adds an additional symbol (the vertical stroke) to mark the\nplace of the antecedent term that makes the \\(F\\)-relation\n asymmetrical.[13]\n\nConsider \\(O(a\\: b)\\) By the fifth law, \\(O(a\\: b)\\) adds a third\nterm, \\(c\\), which is at once compatible with \\(a\\)\nand \\(b\\) (that is, \\(E(a\\: c)\\) and\n\\(E(b\\: c)\\)) and taken together with \\(a\\) and \\(b\\)\nform \\(O(a\\: b\\: c)\\). This third element, following\nthe work of A.B. Kempe (1890), is \u201cbetween\u201d \\(a\\)\nand \\(b\\). Royce (like Kempe) captures\nthis betweenness by requiring that the new third term be compatible\nwith both terms but not reducible to them. In effect, the fifth law\nsays that whenever two actions are incompatible, there exists an\naction \u201cbetween\u201d the two that can, with a correct\ntransformation, order the obverse actions. Using Royce\u2019s\nillustration, Figure 1 represents \\(O(a\\: b\\: c)\\) where \\(c\\)\nis compatible with \\(a\\) and \\(b\\)\nand the region where all three fields overlap, there\nare no elements. Figure 2 represents \\( F(\\neg c | a\\: b )\\) where the\nregion \\(\\neg c\\) overlaps, and so is compatible with, regions \\(A\\)\nand \\(B\\).\n\n\n\nFigure 1. \\(O (a\\: b\\: c)\\)\n\n\n\n\nFigure 2. \\(F (\\neg c | a\\: b)\\)\n\n\nAs Royce explains, \u201cThe \\(F\\)-relation, so long\nas \u2018obverses\u2019 or \u2018negatives\u2019 exist, follows\nimmediately from, and is equivalent to, an \\(O\\)-relation.\nFor, in the diagram [above] if \\(s\\)\nis the total surface in which \\(a\\),\n\\(b\\), and \\(c\\) are included, then when\n\u2018\\(c\\) is between \\(a\\) and \\(b\\),\u2019\n\u2018\\(a\\), \\(b\\),\nand \\(\\neg c\\) (\\(\\neg c\\) being the obverse of \\(c\\))\nconstitute an \\(O\\)-collection,\u2019\nor \u2018are in the \\(O\\)-relation\u2019\u2009\u201d\n(Royce 1905, 387).\n\nThe \\(O\\)-relation is transformed into an \\(F\\)-relation\nby negating one of the three terms,\nselecting one term as the antecedent and another term as the\n\u201corigin.\u201d This is written as \\(F (\\neg A | B\\:\nC)\\), where the term to the left of the vertical stroke is the\nantecedent, and the two remaining terms are the consequent and the\naction \u201cin terms of which\u201d the antecedent and consequent\nare so ordered. The expression can be read: If \\(A\\) is\nnot taken then \\(B\\) follows with respect to \\(C\\).\n\u201cIt is this origin, [\\(C\\)],\u201d\nRoyce observes, \u201cwhich gives\n\u2018sense\u2019 to the pair [\\(A\\: B\\)] in the expression [\\(A\n\\supset B\\) with respect to \\(C\\)]\u201d (1905,\n407).\n\nWhile \\(O\\)-relations are indeterminate as to outcome,\nsince the terms are symmetrically related, F-relations mark the\nselection of possible courses of action and so establish the linear,\nasymmetrical relations of agential action. Royce concludes:\n\u201cWherever a linear series is in question, wherever an origin of\ncoordinates is employed, wherever \u2018cause and effect,\u2019\n\u2018ground and consequence,\u2019 orientation in space or\ndirection of tendency in time are in question, the dyadic asymmetrical\nrelations involved are essentially the same as the relation here\nsymbolized by [\\(p \\supset q\\) with respect to \\(y\\)]\u201d\n(1905, 407).\n\nThe conditionals that result from the initial \\(O\\)-collection\ninclude \\(\\neg A \\supset B\\) with respect\nto \\(C\\), \\(\\neg B \\supset A\\) with respect to \\(C\\),\n\\(\\neg C \\supset A\\) with respect to \\(B\\),\nand so on. Since \\(O\\)-relations are\nsymmetrical, there are as many alternative \u201ccourses\u201d of\naction as there are possibilities of negation and selection of\nantecedents and origins. Since the conditionals are possibilities,\nthey could also be represented \u201c\\(\\Diamond (\\neg C \\supset B)\\),\n\\(A\\)\u201d where \\(A\\) represents a\nshared propositional\n parameter.[14]\n \u201cIt is now possible,\u201d Royce concludes, \u201cto point\nout that the elements of \\(\\Sigma\\) possess the properties of a system\nof logical classes, or of entities to which the ordinary algebra of\nlogic applies\u201d (1905, 427). The resulting conditionals operate\nin a system that is like a relevant possible world logic were the\ntruth of the conditional is dependent on its truth assignment through\nthe propositional parameter that orders antecedent and consequent.\nHowever, Royce cautions against reliance on logics that are primarily\ninterested in conditional relations. Such interest is a result of our\n\u201cintellectual habits\u201d but \u201cin several respects\ninferior to the more direct expression in terms of \\(O\\)-relations.\n\u2026 When, in fact, we attempt to\ndescribe the relations of the system \\(\\Sigma\\) merely in terms of the\nantecedent-consequent relation, we not only limit ourselves to an\narbitrary choice of origin, but miss the power to survey at a glance\nrelations of more than a dyadic, or triadic character\u201d\n(381\u20132).\n3.3 Modal Logic of Agency\n\nAs an idealist philosopher, Royce entered the study of logic (with\nother idealists of his time) interested in the operations of the will\nand the formalization of judgment. The central operation in judgment\nis the selection of one alternative and the rejection of others. In\nthe debates about the central logical operations that emerged in the\n1890s and early 20th century, realist philosophers argued\nagainst founding logic on the basic relation that emerges in\njudgments. Rather, they argued in favor of using the inclusive\ndisjunction as the starting point. The reason given for this\nalternative was that the inclusive disjunction provided a better model\nfor the logic of burgeoning empirical science in two ways. First, it\nbegan with objects already in existence that can be put in relation to\nother already existing objects. Second, the exclusive disjunction\nrequires the recognition of objects that do not exist in the ordinary\nsense (negated objects, for example). When the debates ended with the\nstart of World War One, the realist logicians held the field and\nRoyce\u2019s alternative (and the work of other idealist logicians)\nfaded from view.\n\nRoyce\u2019s development of system \\(\\Sigma\\) occurred before modal\nlogic was formalized. While Royce uses the language of necessity and\npossibility in his discussion of logic, his system has no formal place\nfor it. In fact, his student, C. I. Lewis, seeing the need to account\nfor modal operators in understanding the conditionals of logic,\nproposed the first modal system in 1918, two years after Royce\u2019s\ndeath. Lewis\u2019s introduction of the strict conditional as a means\nof correcting Russell and Whitehead\u2019s material conditional\nsystem required the introduction of modal operators to serve, in\neffect, as the parameter needed to connect the antecedent and\nconsequent of conditionals (Pratt 2007).\n\nRoyce\u2019s project was framed as one fundamentally concerned with\naction as he observed in a 1906 paper. \u201c[T]he fundamental\nlogical relations,\u201d he wrote, \u201care characteristic not only\nof our world of thought, but also of our world of action. For\nwill-acts involve acceptance and refusal, affirmation and negation, a\nconsciousness of consequences, a facing of alternatives, a union of\nvarious acts in one act; so that the logic of action is in form\nprecisely the same as the logic of abstract thought\u201d (1906,\n100). From this perspective, Royce observed in an unpublished lecture\nfrom 1905, \u201cThere is a fundamental relation which may be called\nthe logical relation par excellence. It is the relation between\n\u2018yes\u2019 and \u2018no\u2019, the relation which\ncharacterizes two mutually exclusive alternatives, that together\nexhaust all the possibilities. It is the relation that one faces, when\none has a choice to make. It is also the relation that obtains between\nany logical class and the negative of that class\u201d (1905a, 6).\nThe \\(O\\)-relation then marks both necessity and\npossibility (that is, it marks a necessary relation between\n\u2018yes\u2019 and \u2018no\u2019 and it exhausts the\npossibilities). As I observed earlier, the \\(O\\)-relation\ncan be captured in modern modal logic by\nrepresenting it as the conjunction of two conditionals such that\n\\(O(A\\: B)\\) is \\(\\Box (A \\equiv \\neg B)\\). Although not founded as a\nmodal logic, system \\(\\Sigma\\) is modal in its operations and so\npotentially formalizable in modal terms.\n3.4 Royce\u2019s Logic and Formal Mathematics\n\nRoyce was deeply interested in the developing theories of logic,\nmathematics, and geometry in the 1890s and early 1900s. While he had a\nlifelong interest in logic and mathematics, it was not until 1898,\nwhen he attended a series of lectures by C. S. Peirce titled\nReasoning and the Logic of Things (1898 [1992]), that he\nundertook a thorough study of the work of Cantor, Dedekind, Klein,\nCayley and Kempe. Royce regarded Peirce\u2019s lectures as\n\u201cepoch marking,\u201d as he noted in a letter to James (1970,\n422), in part because new mathematical theory gave him a way to\naddress a central criticism of his metaphysics.\n\nIn the years immediately prior to the Peirce lectures, Royce\u2019s\nmetaphysical views had been sharply criticized on the grounds that his\nconcept of the Absolute had made individuals unreal, subsumed by the\nwhole (Howison in Royce 1897, 98\u20139). Royce countered the\ncriticism, by arguing that the Absolute was a system that was composed\nof real individuals (2000, 297, 314\u20135). Royce, however, was\nunable to provide a compelling formal argument for the possibility of\na system in which the parts of a whole could also be distinct, a view\nrejected with a well-known argument of F. H. Bradley (Royce 1959,\n477\u2013485). Peirce\u2019s 1898 lecture included a case for his\nthen-current conception of continuity (he proposed several) in which\nthe unified whole was a logical consequence of a universe of discrete\nindividuals (Moore 2007), that is, where \u201cwe have now reached a\nmultitude so vast that the individuals of such a collection melt into\none another and lose their distinct identities\u201d (Peirce 1898\n[1992, 159]). In making his case, Peirce called on resources from\nBoole, Cantor, Dedekind and Kempe among others. By 1900, Royce offered\nhis own version of continuity, the concept of an infinite,\nself-representative system. Published as a lengthy\n\u201csupplementary essay\u201d to The World and\nIndividual, First Series, and framed as an answer to Bradley,\nRoyce aimed to provide a proof that a single infinite system could\ncontain multitudes of distinct individuals.\n\nBy 1901, Royce had begun to reframe his metaphysics in terms of the\nErlanger Programm, devised by Klein (1893) as a means of\nclassifying different geometries by identifying what is invariant\nacross transformations in each system. Klein demonstrated that the\ninvariants of projective geometry could be captured in a set of\npostulates that would also hold for Euclidean and other non-Euclidean\ngeometries each of which included the invariants of projective\ngeometry and additional invariants (Bell, 1940, 442\u2013448). Royce\nargued that Kempe\u2019s system, and Royce\u2019s own System\n\\(\\Sigma\\), were defined by abstract postulates that would be\nnecessary for any system of order whatever including projective\ngeometry. In unpublished notes from 1901, Royce explicitly attributed\nthe source of his discussion to the Erlanger Programm and\nargued that invariants of the sort identified by Kempe are illustrated\nin projective geometry, \u201cjust\u201d land transactions,\n\u201cKant\u2019s moral world,\u201d musical performance, and\nselves. For Royce, the invariants of geometry and so findings based\nupon their analysis could directly inform the analysis of other\nordering processes (1901, 96\u2013110).\n\nThe publication of \u201cThe Relation of the Principles of Logic to\nthe Foundations of Geometry\u201d (1905) and \u201cAn Extension of\nthe Algebra of Logic\u201d (1913b) were significant works of pure\nmathematics but were also intended to illustrate invariants across\ntransformations of all sorts. Burch (2011) has left open the question\nof how Royce\u2019s work in mathematical logic is related to his\ngeneral philosophical project, but has argued that Royce nevertheless\nmade a significant contribution to mathematical logic by developing\nthe concept of a Boolean Ring and an algebra identical to the system\ndevised at about the same time by Russian logician, Ivan Ivanovich\nZhegalkin, renowned as \u201cthe \u2018father\u2019 of the Russian\nschool of logic\u201d (231). Central to the Boolean Ring operations\nand to the larger System \\(\\Sigma\\) is Royce\u2019s development of\nthe operation of symmetric difference (discussed elsewhere as the \\(O\\)-relation),\nwhich is also viewed as one of\nRoyce\u2019s major contributions by later reviewers, Burton and\nLeblanc (1952). While Burch suggests the possibility of a full\nexposition of System \\(\\Sigma\\), apart from Royce\u2019s own there is\ncurrently no such treatment available. Burch also discusses\nRoyce\u2019s work in philosophical logic in the introduction to a\npaper by Royce addressing Russell\u2019s paradox as presented in\nRussell\u2019s 1903 The Principles of Logic. This paper,\nBurch argues, both demonstrates Royce\u2019s familiarity with\ndevelopments in modern logic at the time and presents an alternative\nresolution of the paradox similar to Frege\u2019s response while also\noffering a non-foundational set theory (1987). Other important\nassessments of Royce\u2019s work in mathematics and logic include\nearly reviews by Sheffer (1908), De Laguna (1906), and C. I. Lewis\n(1916), and more recent assessments in papers by Crouch (2011) and\nScanlan (2011).\n", "bibliography": {"categories": ["Primary Literature", "Secondary Literature"], "cat_ref_text": {"Primary Literature": ["</h3>\n<p>\nA collection of works relevant to Royce studies, including a growing\ncritical edition of his works, is available online:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<a href=\"https://royce-edition.iupui.edu/\" target=\"_blank\">The Writings of Josiah Royce: A Critical Edition</a>.\n Indiana University-Purdue University Indianapolis.\n</blockquote>\n<p>\nThe most complete bibliography of Royce\u2019s published writings\nis:</p>\n<blockquote>\nSkrupskelis, I.
