Early Theories: Socialization\n\nIn the theory of the socialized actor (Parsons 1951), individual\naction is intended as a choice among alternatives. Human action is\nunderstood within a utilitarian framework as instrumentally oriented\nand utility maximizing. Although a utilitarian setting does not\nnecessarily imply a view of human motives as essentially egoistic,\nthis is the preferred interpretation of utilitarianism adopted by\nTalcott Parsons and much contemporary sociology. In this context, it\nbecomes crucial to explain through which mechanisms social order and\nstability are attained in a society that would otherwise be in a\npermanent Hobbesian state of nature. In short, order and stability are\nessentially socially derived phenomena, brought about by a common\nvalue system\u2014the \u201ccement\u201d of society. The\ncommon values of a society are embodied in norms that, when conformed\nto, guarantee the orderly functioning and reproduction of the social\nsystem. In the Parsonian framework norms are exogenous: how such a\ncommon value system is created and how it may change are issues left\nunexplored. The most important question is rather how norms get to be\nfollowed, and what prompts rational egoists to abide by them. The\nanswer given by the theory of the socialized actor is that people\nvoluntarily adhere to the shared value system, because it is\nintrojected to form a constitutive element of the personality itself\n(Parsons 1951).\n\nIn Parsons\u2019 own words, a norm is\n\n\na verbal description of a concrete course of action, \u2026 ,\nregarded as desirable, combined with an injunction to make certain\nfuture actions conform to this course. (1937: 75)\n\n\nNorms play a crucial role in individual choice since\u2014by shaping\nindividual needs and preferences\u2014they serve as criteria for\nselecting among alternatives. Such criteria are shared by a given\ncommunity and embody a common value system. People may choose what\nthey prefer, but what they prefer in turn conforms to social\nexpectations: norms influence behavior because, through a process of\nsocialization that starts in infancy, they become part of one\u2019s\nmotives for action. Conformity to standing norms is a stable, acquired\ndisposition that is independent of the consequences of conforming.\nSuch lasting dispositions are formed by long-term interactions with\nsignificant others (e.g., one\u2019s parents): through repeated\nsocialization, individuals come to learn and internalize the common\nvalues embodied in the norms. Internalization is conceived as the\nprocess by which people develop a psychological need or motive to\nconform to a set of shared norms. When norms are internalized\nnorm-abiding behavior will be perceived as good or appropriate, and\npeople will typically feel guilt or shame at the prospect of behaving\nin a deviant way. If internalization is successful external sanctions\nwill play no role in eliciting conformity and, since individuals are\nmotivated to conform, it follows that normative beliefs and actions\nwill be consistent.\n\nAlthough Parsons\u2019 analysis of social systems starts with a\ntheory of individual action, he views social actors as behaving\naccording to roles that define their identities and actions (through\nsocialization and internalization). The goal of individual action is\nto maximize satisfaction. The potential conflict between individual\ndesires and collective goals is resolved by characterizing the common\nvalue system as one that precedes and constrains the social actor. The\nprice of this solution is the disappearance of the individual actor as\nthe basic unit of analysis. Insofar as individuals are role-bearers,\nin Parsons\u2019 theory it is social entities that act: entities that\nare completely detached from the individual actions that created them.\nThis consideration forms the basis for most of the criticisms raised\nagainst the theory of the socialized actor (Wrong 1961); such\ncriticisms are typically somewhat abstract as they are cast in the\nframework of the holism/individualism controversy.\n\nOn the other hand, one may easily verify whether empirical predictions\ndrawn from the socialized actor theory are supported by experimental\nevidence. For instance, the following predictions can be derived from\nthe theory and easily put to test. (a) Norms will change very slowly\nand only through intensive social interaction. (b) Normative beliefs\nare positively correlated to actions; whenever such beliefs change,\nbehavior will follow. (c) If a norm is successfully internalized,\nexpectations of others\u2019 conformity will have no effect on an\nindividual\u2019s choice to conform.\n\nSome of the above statements are not supported by empirical evidence\nfrom social psychology. For example, it has been shown that there may\nnot be a relation between people\u2019s normative beliefs (or\nattitudes) and what people in fact do. In this respect, it should be\nnoted that experimental psychologists have generally focused on\n\u201cattitudes\u201d, that is, \u201cevaluative feelings of pro or\ncon, favorable or unfavorable, with regard to particular\nobjects\u201d (where the objects may be \u201cconcrete\nrepresentations of things or actions, or abstract concepts\u201d;\nInsko & Schopler 1967: 361\u2013362). As such, the concept of\nattitude is quite broad: it includes normative beliefs, as well as\npersonal opinions and preferences. That said, a series of field\nexperiments has provided evidence contrary to the assumption that\nattitudes and behaviors are closely related. LaPiere (1934) famously\nreported a sharp divergence between the widespread anti-Chinese\nattitudes in the United States and the tolerant behavior he witnessed.\nOther studies have pointed to inconsistencies between an\nindividual\u2019s stated normative beliefs and her actions (Wicker\n1969): several reasons may account for such a discrepancy. For\nexample, studies of racial prejudice indicate that normative beliefs\nare more likely to determine behavior in long-lasting relationships,\nand least likely to determine behavior in the transient situations\ntypical of experimental studies (Harding et al. 1954 [1969]; Gaertner\n& Dovidio 1986). Warner and DeFleur (1969) reported that the main\nvariable affecting discriminatory behavior is one\u2019s belief about\nwhat society (e.g., most other people) says one should do, as\nopposed to what one personally thinks one should do.\n\nIn brief, the social psychology literature provides mixed evidence in\nsupport of the claim that an individual\u2019s normative beliefs and\nattitudes influence her actions. Such studies, however, do not\ncarefully discriminate among various types of normative beliefs. In\nparticular, one should distinguish between \u201cpersonal normative\nbeliefs\u201d (i.e., beliefs that a certain behavior ought to be\nfollowed) and \u201cnormative expectations\u201d (i.e., what one\nbelieves others believe ought to be done, that is, a second-order\nbelief): it then becomes apparent that oftentimes only such\nsecond-order beliefs affect behavior.\n\nThe above constitutes an important criticism of the socialized actor\ntheory. According to Parsons, once a norm is internalized, members of\nsociety are motivated to conform by an internal sanctioning system;\ntherefore, one should observe a high correlation among all orders of\nnormative beliefs and behavior. However, experimental\nevidence does not support such a view (see also: Fishbein 1967;\nCialdini et al. 1991). Another indication that the socialized actor\ntheory lacks generality is the observation that norms can change\nrather quickly, and that new norms often emerge in a short period of\ntime among complete strangers (Mackie 1996). Long-term or close\ninteractions do not seem to be necessary for someone to acquire a\ngiven normative disposition, as is testified by the relative ease with\nwhich individuals learn new norms when they change status or group\n(e.g., from single to married, from student to faculty, etc.).\nMoreover, studies of emergent social and political groups have shown\nthat new norms may form rather rapidly, and that the demise of old\npatterns of behavior is often abrupt (Robinson 1932; Klassen et al.\n1989; Prentice & Miller 1993; Matza 1964). Given the\naforementioned limitations, Parsons\u2019 theory might perhaps be\ntaken as an explanation of a particular conception of moral norms (in\nthe sense of internalized, unconditional imperatives), but it cannot\nbe viewed as a general theory of social norms.\n",
