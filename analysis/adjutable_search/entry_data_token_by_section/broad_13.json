    "main_text": "Metaphilosophy\n6. Metaphilosophy\n\nBroad distinguishes two chief aspects of philosophical thinking. He\nlabels these critical philosophy and speculative philosophy.\nCritical philosophy has two chief tasks, one of which is to\nanalyse \u201ccertain very general concepts such as number, thing,\nquality, change, cause, etc.\u201d (1924, p. 82). We make use of\nthese and a whole host of other concepts in science and ordinary life.\nAlthough we are typically able to apply them fairly consistently, we\nare not able to analyse them. Nor are we able to state their precise\nrelations to each other. One task of critical philosophy is to provide\nanalyses of such concepts. It becomes evident that this is an\nimportant task as soon as it is realized that when we seek to apply\nthese concepts to odd or exceptional cases we are often uncertain\nwhether they are applicable. For example, it might be unclear whether\na certain individual with a multiple personality disorder is a\nperson or\n not.[14]\n Such difficulties arise because \u201cwe are not clear as to what we\nmean by \u2018being a person\u2019\u201d (1924, p. 83). There is,\ntherefore, a need for an intellectual discipline that seeks to analyse\nand define this and many other concepts.\n\nIn science and in daily life we do not merely use unanalysed concepts.\n\u201cWe also assume uncritically a number of very fundamental\npropositions. In all our arguments we assume the truth of certain\nprinciples of reasoning. Again, we always assume that every change has\na cause. And in induction we certainly assume something\u2014it is\nhard to say what\u2014about the fundamental \u2018make-up\u2019 of\nthe existent world\u201d (1924, p. 84).\n\nThe second task of critical philosophy is to examine these and other\nfundamental assumptions; it is \u201cto take these propositions which\nwe uncritically assume in science and daily life and to subject them\nto criticism\u201d\n (ibid.).[15]\n\nIn order to analyse a proposition we must seek to attain a clearer\ngrasp of the concepts featured in the proposition. Thus the analysis\nand criticism of a proposition depends on the analysis of concepts.\nAnd vice versa: by reflecting on the propositions in which a\ncertain concept occurs we clear up the meaning of it.\n\nNow, critical philosophy is one part or aspect of philosophical\nthinking. But critical philosophy \u201cdoes not include all that is\nunderstood by philosophy. It is certainly held to be the function of a\nphilosopher to discuss the nature of Reality as a whole, and to\nconsider the position and prospects of men in it\u201d (1924, p. 96).\nThis aspect of philosophical thinking is speculative\nphilosophy.\n\nSpeculative philosophy seeks to work out a view of reality as a whole\nby taking into account the whole range of human\nexperience\u2014scientific, social, ethical, \u00e6sthetic, and\nreligious: \u201cIts business is to take over all aspects of human\nexperience, to reflect upon them, and to try to think out a view of\nReality as a whole which shall do justice to all of them\u201d (1924,\np. 96).\n\nBroad\u2019s idea is that the various aspects of human experience and\n(putative) facts linked to these provide a point of departure for\nphilosophical reflection\u2014an exceedingly important sort of\nreflection aiming at a reasoned view of Reality as a whole.\n\nAs can be gathered from the above, philosophical thinking features,\naccording to Broad, a distinctive type of birds-eye view. He calls it\nsynopsis. Let us take a somewhat closer look at this. The\nplain man as well as the professional scientist or scholar\n\nconduct various parts of their living and their thinking in relatively\nwatertight compartments; turn blind eyes to awkward, abnormal, or\nmarginal facts; and skate successfully on the surface of the\nphenomena. But the desire to see how the various aspects of experience\nhang together does arise from time to time in most intelligent men,\nand philosophers are persons in whom it is especially strong and\npersistent. Now I understand by synopsis the necessary\npreliminary towards trying to satisfy this desire, viz. the deliberate\nviewing together of aspects of human experience which are generally\nviewed apart, and the endeavour to see how they are inter-related.\n(1947a, p. 4)\n\n\nOn reflection it is clear that the synoptic stance is necessary for\nthe discovery of various inadequacies in our picture of reality,\ninadequacies resulting from a far too insular perspective on reality.\nThe synoptic stance will, in effect, lead to the discovery of latent\nphilosophical problems: \u201cIt is synopsis, revealing prima\nfacie incoherence, which is the main motive to philosophical\nactivity\u201d (1958, p. 121; cf. 1947a, p. 16). And it is clearly\nonly after we have discovered and successfully addressed these\nproblems that we may lay claim to a satisfactory picture of reality as\na whole.\n\nBroad gives several examples of how synopsis is featured in\nphilosophical thinking. One of these is taken from the free will\nproblem (1947a, pp. 8\u201311). In a very condensed form the main\nfacts germane to the problem are these: (i) When we consider a\nsituation in which we did a certain action, we are quite convinced\nthat we could have done otherwise: we could have performed an\nalternative action. On reflection it seems clear that\n\u2018could\u2019 is used in some sense that is not analysable in\nterms of \u2018would have, if\u2019. (ii) Our moral judgments seem\nto presuppose that a person who in fact willed to do a certain action\ncould have willed otherwise. (iii) Given the past, the actual\nsituation and the laws of nature it seems impossible that anything\nother should have happened than what in fact did happen. If so, how\ncan our volitions be other than completely determined? (iv) It is\ndifficult, then, to reconcile the notions of moral responsibility with\nthe view that our volitions are completely determined.\n\nThe problem of free will is discovered when we look at (i) and (ii) in\nthe light of (iii) In other words, the very problem is discerned only\nbecause we have envisaged these facts together, i.e. because we have\ntaken a synoptic view of the facts.\n",
