    "main_text": "Answering the Identification Question || Disjunctive, Hybrid, and Other Views\n2.4 Disjunctive, Hybrid, and Other Views\n\nOur discussion of the trickery and pressure accounts highlights a\nrather striking fact: If we survey the tactics that seem intuitively\nto be examples of manipulation, we find tactics that seem best\ndescribed as forms of trickery as well as tactics that seem best\ndescribed as forms of pressure. This is puzzling, since, on the face\nof it, trickery and pressure seem rather dissimilar. What should we\nmake of the fact that we use the same\nconcept\u2014manipulation\u2014to refer to methods of influence that\nseem to operate by such dissimilar mechanisms?\n\nSeveral responses are possible. First, it is possible that the common\nusage of term \u201cmanipulation\u201d refers to such a diverse set\nof phenomena that no single analysis will capture every form of\ninfluence to which the term is commonly applied. Felicia Ackerman\nargues that the term \u201cmanipulation\u201d exhibits\n\u201ccombinatorial vagueness\u201d: while it is connected to\nfeatures like inhibition of rational deliberation, unethicalness,\ndeceptiveness, playing upon non-rational impulses, shrewdness,\npressure, etc., \u201cno condition on the list is sufficient,\n\u2026 and no single condition \u2026 is even necessary\u201d for\nan instance of influence to be manipulative (Ackerman 1995:\n337\u201338).\n\nSecond, we might hold that the concept of manipulation is not vague\nbut rather disjunctive, so that manipulation consists of\neither trickery or pressure. Indeed, in one of the\nearliest philosophical analyses of manipulation, Joel Rudinow takes\nthis approach. Rudinow begins with the following thesis:\n\n\nA attempts to manipulate S iff A attempts\nto influence S\u2019s behavior by means of deception or\npressure or by playing on a supposed weakness of S. (Rudinow\n1978: 343)\n\n\nHe goes on to claim that that the use of pressure is manipulative only\nif the would-be manipulator directs it at some supposed weakness in\nhis target that will render the target unable to resist it; this leads\nhim to finalize his definition in terms of \u201cdeception or by\nplaying upon a supposed weakness\u201d of the target, with the second\ndisjunct meant to cover pressure-based tactics (Rudinow 1978: 346).\nSeveral other philosophers have followed Rudinow\u2019s disjunctive\napproach to defining manipulation (Tomlinson 1986; Sher 2011; Mandava\n& Millum 2013). Indeed, as we have noted, it is common for people\nwho discuss manipulative pressure to claim that manipulation comes in\nother forms as well.\n\nA somewhat different version of the disjunctive strategy might begin\nwith the pressure account\u2019s continuum pressure of between\nrational persuasion and coercion, but go on to add a second dimension\nconsisting of a continuum between rational persuasion and outright\nlying. We might then define manipulation in terms of a two-dimensional\nspace bounded by rational persuasion, outright lying, and coercion. A\nstrategy like this is suggested by Sapir Handelman, although he adds a\nthird dimension that measures the level of \u201ccontrol\u201d that\na given form of influence exerts (Handelman 2009).\n\nPatricia Greenspan suggests that manipulation is a sort of hybrid\nbetween coercion and deception. She writes that\n\n\ncases of manipulation seem to have a foot in both of the usual\ncategories of intentional interference with another agent\u2019s\nautonomy, coercion and deception, but partly as a result, they do not\nfit squarely in either category. (Greenspan 2003: 157)\n\n\nThus, we might characterize her view as a \u201cconjunctive\u201d\ntheory of manipulation, according to which it contains elements of\nboth pressure and deception. It certainly seems true\nthat manipulators often use both pressure and deception. For example,\na manipulator who employs peer pressure might also exaggerate the\nextent to which the target\u2019s peers will disapprove of her if she\nchooses the option that the manipulator wants her not to choose.\nHowever, we can also point to relatively pure cases of manipulative\npressure or manipulative trickery: Indeed, all of the items on the\nlist above can be imagined as involving either pure pressure or pure\ntrickery. The apparent existence of cases of manipulation that involve\nonly deception or only pressure seems to be a problem for\nGreenspan\u2019s hybrid view.\n\nStrategies for characterizing manipulation that combine the trickery\nand pressure accounts are appealing because they seem to do a better\njob than either the trickery or pressure account alone in accounting\nfor the wide variety of tactics that seem intuitively to count as\nmanipulation. However, this wider coverage comes at a price. If the\ndisjunctive approach simply puts an \u201cor\u201d between the\ntrickery and pressure accounts, then it will leave unanswered the\nquestion of what, if anything, makes all forms of manipulation\nmanifestations of the same phenomenon. Of course, it is possible that\nthis question cannot be answered because, as a matter of fact, there\nare two irreducibly different forms of manipulation. But this seems\nlike a conclusion that we should accept only reluctantly, after having\nmade a good faith effort to determine whether there really is anything\nin common between pressure-based manipulation and trickery-based\nmanipulation. (For a recent attempt to locate a common feature of\nmanipulative pressure and manipulative trickery, see Noggle 2020).\n\nOne possible answer to this challenge might be drawn from Marcia\nBaron\u2019s important paper on \u201cManipulativeness\u201d, which\ndiagnoses the underlying moral wrong in manipulation in terms of an\nAristotelian vice. She suggests treating manipulativeness as the vice\nof excess with regard to \u201cto what extent\u2014and how and when\nand to whom and for what sorts of ends\u2014to seek to influence\nothers\u2019 conduct\u201d (Baron 2003: 48). On her view,\nmanipulativeness is at the opposite extreme from the vice of\n\n\nrefraining from offering potentially helpful counsel; or refraining\nfrom trying to stop someone from doing something very dangerous, for\nexample, from driving home from one\u2019s house while drunk. (Baron\n2003: 48)\n\n\nPerhaps, then, we can understand the underlying similarity between\ntrickery- and pressure-based manipulation as manifestations of a\ncommon vice, as different ways of going wrong with regard to how and\nhow much we should try to influence those around us.\n\nAlthough Baron\u2019s remarks about the mind-set of the manipulator\nare insightful and instructive, it is unclear whether they suffice to\nanswer the characterization question. For it is unclear whether, by\nthemselves, they can distinguish manipulation from other forms of\nexcess with regard to influence, such as coercion.\n\nThe idea that manipulation should be characterized at least in part by\nreference to the mindset of the manipulator also appears in recent\nwork by Michael Klenk (2022). According to Klenk, the manipulator\ninfluences negligently: manipulation involves influencing someone by\nsome method while disregarding whether that method reveals reasons for\nthe target to do, think, or feel as the manipulator wishes (Klenk\n2022: 97).  While this view requires a certain mindset from the\nmanipulator, it also has some affinities for the trickery view,\ninasmuch as the negligence required is negligence with regard to\nwhether the influence tricks the target into changing how he feels,\nacts, or thinks for a bad reason or no reason at all. A hybrid view\nalong these lines might allow us to integrate some of Baron\u2019s\ninsights about the manipulator\u2019s mindset with a more specific\ncharacterization of the sort of influence to which that mindset\nleads.\n",
