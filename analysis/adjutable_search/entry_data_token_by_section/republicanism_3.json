    "main_text": "Political Liberty as Non-Domination || Republican versus Negative Liberty\n1.3 Republican versus Negative Liberty\n\nNotice that the republican view of freedom is, at least in the broad\nsense, a negative conception of political liberty. One need not do or\nbecome anything in particular to enjoy political liberty in the\nrepublican sense; one need not exercise self-mastery, on any view of\nwhat that entails, nor succeed in acting on one\u2019s second-order\ndesires (Skinner 1984, 1991, 2002; Spitz 1993). Republican freedom\nmerely requires the absence of something, namely, the absence of any\nstructural dependence on arbitrary power or domination. (Also like\nnon-interference, non-domination comes in degrees: on the civic\nrepublican view, one is not either free or unfree, but rather more or\nless free depending on the extent of non-domination one securely\nenjoys.)\n\nDespite these similarities, however, republican freedom is not\nequivalent to the received view of negative liberty as\nnon-interference. In contrast to the non-interference view, it easily\naccounts for our intuitions in the two scenarios described above. The\nslave lacks freedom because he is vulnerable to the arbitrary power of\nhis master; whether his master happens to exercise that power is\nneither here nor there. Likewise, what matters with respect to\npolitical freedom on the republican view is not how much the\nimperial power chooses to govern its colony, but the fact that the\nformer may choose to govern the latter as much and however it likes.\nThus Joseph Priestley described the lightly-governed American colonies\nas nevertheless in a condition of servitude because \u201cby the same\npower, by which the people of England can compel them to pay one\npenny, they may compel them to pay the last penny they have\u201d\n(1769, 140).\n\nMoreover, the republican conception captures in a more intuitively\nsatisfying way what would improve either situation with\nrespect to political liberty. Most people are not inclined to say that\nslaves enjoy increasing freedom just because, with experience, they\nimprove their insight into their master\u2019s psychological\ndispositions. But many would be inclined to say that their\nfreedom is enhanced, other things being equal, if some effective\nreform in the laws, institutions, or norms sharply reduced their\nmaster\u2019s authority over them. (This is not necessarily to say\nthat the slaves will enjoy greater well-being, all things\nconsidered\u2014only that because their domination is lessened, they\nenjoy greater freedom to that extent.) And of course, no matter how\nbenevolent their particular master happens to be, no slave can be\ncompletely free until the institution of slavery itself is\nabolished.\n\nPolitical freedom, in other words, is constituted by rightly-ordered\nlaws, institutions, and norms: \u201cto enjoy such non-domination,\nafter all, is just to be in a position where no one can interfere\narbitrarily in your affairs,\u201d writes Pettit, \u201cand you are\nin that position from the moment that the institutions are in\nplace\u201d inhibiting possible arbitrary interference (1997, 107).\nPolitical freedom is most fully realized, on this view, in a\nwell-ordered self-governing republic of equal citizens under the rule\nof law, where no one citizen is the master of any other (Pettit 1989,\n1997, 2012, 2014; Skinner 1991, 1998; Spitz 1993, 1995; Viroli 2002;\nMaynor 2003; Lovett 2022). In the classic expression of James\nHarrington, such a community would be an \u201cempire of laws and not\nof men\u201d (1656, 8).\n",
