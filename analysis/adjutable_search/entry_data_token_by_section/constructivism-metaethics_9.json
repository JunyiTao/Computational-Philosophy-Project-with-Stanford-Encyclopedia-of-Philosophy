    "main_text": "Constructivism About Moral Principles || Society-Based Constructivism\n5.2 Society-Based Constructivism\n\nSociety-based constructivism \u2013 elaborated by David Copp, holds\nthat there are true moral standards, which are the output of a\ndecision procedure that takes into account the needs and values of the\nsociety and facts about the society\u2019s circumstances (Copp 1995,\n2007). Accordingly, the theory accounts for moral truth as depending\non what would be rational for societies to choose. Copp\u2019s view\nshares some important features with Kantian constructivism. First,\nsociety-based constructivism holds that societies need their members\nto endorse some suitable moral code in order to facilitate\ncooperation. It thus takes morality to be a cooperative enterprise,\nand implies that the need for objective moral standards is practical.\nSecond, this view explains the nature of moral truth in procedural\nterms, and thus it implies that there are no moral facts independently\nof the procedure (Rawls 1980: 307). Third, it also shares the claim\nthat to be adequate, any metaethics should make sense of the\nnormativity of moral claims and their practical relevance (Copp 2007:\n4\u20137, 2013). Like Kantian constructivism, it holds that we are\nbound by moral obligations independently of our actual motivational\nstates. Finally, society-based constructivism also claims that any\nplausible metaethics should be at least compatible with\nnaturalism.\n\nHowever, society-based constructivism differs from the various Kantian\nconstructivisms because of its account of the decision procedure from\nwhich moral standards are said to result, and its different\nexplanation of normativity. While the procedure specifies a function\nof practical rationality, it does not commit to any specific view\nabout autonomy.\n\nIn contrast to the antirealist varieties of metaethical\nconstructivism, Copp defends society-based constructivism as both a\ndecisively realist and naturalistic theory. It is realist insofar as\nit claims that moral propositions are truth-evaluable, and that some\nmoral properties are instantiated; and it is naturalistic because it\nclaims that such moral properties are natural properties (Copp\n1995).\n",
