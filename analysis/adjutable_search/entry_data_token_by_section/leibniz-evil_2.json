    "main_text": "The Underachiever Problem\n3. The Holiness Problem\n\n\nFar less scholarly attention has been devoted to Leibniz's treatment of\nthe holiness problem, if only because this conception of the problem\nhas only recently been recognized by Leibniz scholars. As noted\nabove, the main problem here is that God's character seems to be\nstained by evil because God causally contributes to the\nexistence of everything in the world, and evil is one of those things.\n[For two recent treatments see Sleigh (1996) and Murray (2005)]\n\nThe standard solution adopted by medieval thinkers was to deny an\nassumption of the preceding argument, namely, that evil is\n\u201csomething.\u201d Evil was claimed not to have any positive\nreality, but to be a mere \u201cprivation\u201d or\n\u201clack\u201d of being.  On such a view, evil has no more reality\nthan the hole in the center of a donut. Making a donut does not\nrequire putting together two components, the cake and the hole: the\ncake is all that there is to the donut, and the hole is just the\n\u201cprivation of cake.\u201d It therefore would be silly to say\nthat making the donut requires causing both the cake and the hole to\nexist. Causing the cake to exist causes the hole as a\n\u201cby-product\u201d of causing a particular kind of cake to\nexist.  Thus, we need not assume any additional cause for the hole\nbeyond that assumed for the causing of the cake. \n\n\nThe upshot of our pastry analogy is this: given that evil, like the\nhole, is merely a privation, it requires no cause (or as the\nmedievals, and Leibniz, liked to say, it needs no \u201ccause per\nse\u201d). God does not \u201ccausally contribute to the\nexistence of evil\u201d because evil per se is not a thing\nand therefore requires no cause in order to exist. And since God does\nnot cause the existence of evil, God cannot be causally implicated in\nevil. Thus, the holiness problem evaporates.\n\n\nEarly in his philosophical career, Leibniz, like other\nseventeenth-century philosophers, scoffed at this solution to the\nholiness problem. In a short piece entitled \u201cThe Author of\nSin,\u201d Leibniz explains why he thinks the privation response to\nthe holiness problem fails. Leibniz argues that God is the author of\nall that is real and positive in the world, and that God is therefore\nalso the \u201cauthor\u201d of all of privations in the world.\n\u201cIt is a manifest illusion to hold that God is not the author of\nsin because there is no such thing as an author of a privation, even\nthough he can be called the author of everything which is real and\npositive in the sinful act\u201d [A.6.3.150].\n\n\nLeibniz explains why he takes this response to be a \u201cmanifest\nillusion,\u201d through the consideration of an example. Suppose that\na painter creates two paintings that are identical in every respect,\nexcept that the one is a scaled down version of the other. It would be\nabsurd, Leibniz remarks,\n\u2026 to say that the painter is the author of all that is\nreal in the two paintings, without however being the author of what is\nlacking or the disproportion between the larger and the smaller\npainting\u2026 . In effect, what is lacking is nothing more than a\nsimple result of an infallible consequence of that which is positive,\nwithout any need for a distinct author [of that which is lacking].\n[A.6.3.151]\n\n\nSo even if it is true that evil is a privation, this does not have as\na consequence that God is not the author of sin. Given that what is\npositively willed by God is a sufficient condition for the existence\nof the evil state of affairs, in virtue of willing what is positive in\nsome state of affairs, God is also the author of what is privative in\nthat state of affairs.  [A similar early critique is found at\nA.6.3.544]. \n\n\nLeibniz therefore sought to develop a different strategy in order to\nclear God of the charge of being the author of sin. In\nthe Philosopher's Confession, his most significant treatise\non evil aside from the Theodicy, Leibniz claims that although\nGod wills everything in the world, his will with respect to goods\nis decretory , whereas his will with respect to evils is\nmerely permissive. And Leibniz argues that God's permissive\nwilling of evils is morally permissible if and only if such permission\nof evil is necessary in order for one to meet one's moral\nobligations..\n\n\nIt should be noted that Leibniz does not think that the\npermission of evil is morally justified on the grounds that such permission\nbrings about a greater good that may not otherwise be\nachieved. Such an explanation, according to Leibniz, would make\nit the case that God would violate in the Biblical injunction\n\u201cnot to do evil that good may come\u201d [Causa Dei 36\n(S 121; G VI 444)]. Leibniz therefore claims that the evil that God\npermits is a necessary consequence of God's fulfilling his\nduty (namely, to create the best world).  Leibniz characterizes\n(morally permissible) permission as follows:\nP permits E iff: \n\n\nP fails to will that E\nP fails to will that not-E\nP brings it about that the state of affairs S\nobtains by willing that S obtains\nIf S obtains then E obtains\nP knows that (4)\nP believes that it is P's duty to will S and\nthat the good of performing one's duty outweighs the evil entailed by\nE's obtaining\n\n\n\n[This account is distilled from A.6.3.129\u2013131]\n\n\n\nThis, Leibniz believes, resolves any holiness problem that might arise\nin so far as God is considered as the creator of the\nuniverse. However, after writing the Philosopher's\nConfession, Leibniz became increasingly concerned that a tension\nmight arise in his account when it was applied to the holiness problem\nin the context of concurrence. Recall that traditional\ntheists held that God was not only creator and conserver of all\ncreated things, but that God also was the concurrent cause of all\nactions of created things. \n\n\nThere were heated debates in the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries\nconcerning the nature of divine concurrence.  The dispute centered on\nthe respect in which God concurred with the free acts of\ncreatures. This was an especially pressing problem for the obvious\nreason that positing too close a connection between God and created\nbeings in cases where moral evils are committed runs the risk of\nimplicating God in the evil, thus raising the holiness problem all\nover again. This debate often focused on a certain type of proposition\nand on what made this type of proposition true. The propositions in\nquestion are called \u201cconditional future contingents\u201d,\npropositions of the form:\nIf agent S were in circumstances C and\ntime t, S would freely chose to f.\n\n\nPropositions of this form were particularly important in discussions\nof philosophical theology in the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries\nbecause it was believed that it was necessary that God know\npropositions of this type in order to exercise providential control\nover the free actions of created beings. In order to exercise\nprovidential control over free actions in the created world, God must\nknow precisely how each such being will choose to act in each\ncircumstance in which it will find itself. If God, for example, did\nnot know what Eve would choose to do when confronted by the serpent,\nor what I would choose to do when confronted with a tuna sandwich, God\ncould not know in advance the order of events in the universe he\ndeigns to create. \n\n\nBut how does God know whether or not a token proposition of\nthis type is true? In general, disputants in this period held that\nthere are only two possible answers to this question. God knows that a\ntoken proposition of this type is true either because he wills that\nthat proposition be true, or he knows that proposition to be true\nbecause something independent of his will makes it true, and God, in\nvirtue of his omniscience, therefore knows it to be true. Following\nrecent scholarship, we will call the first view the\n\u201cpostvolitional view\u201d (since the truth of the proposition\nis determined only after God wills it) and the latter view the\n\u201cprevolitional\u201d view (since the truth of the proposition\nis independent of what God wills). In his early writings on the topic,\nLeibniz seemed inclined to postvolitionalism. So take the token\nproposition:\nIf Peter were accused of consorting with Christ during\nChrist's trial, Peter would deny Christ.\n\n\nThe early Leibniz holds that this type of proposition is true because\nGod decrees that it would be true: that is, God decrees that Peter\nwould deny Christ under these circumstances [see C 26\u20137 and Gr\n312\u20133]. Furthermore, those who held this view generally held that it\nwas in virtue of divine concurrence that God makes the proposition\ntrue in the actual world. So, in virtue of causally influencing Peter\nat the moment of his decision, God brings it about that Peter denies\nChrist in these circumstances.\n\n\nThis view obviously faces a number of difficulties. For our\npurposes, the most pressing one is that it seems to undercut Leibniz's\nsolution to the holiness problem based on permission. For if the above\nproposition is true because God wills that it be true, then it would seem that\nGod wills that Peter sin, and if he wills that Peter sin, he cannot\nmerely permit it, in light of condition (1) of the definition of\npermission given above. Consequently, it appears that Leibniz must abandon his\ninitial answer to the question of \u201cwhat makes conditional future\ncontingents true\u201d and adopt the alternative answer.\n\n\nThe alternative answer also raises problems. What does it mean to say\nthat the truth of the proposition is determined independently of God's\nwill? Defenders of this view usually hold that the human will cannot\nbe determined. When an agent chooses freely, nothing can\n\u201cdetermine\u201d or \u201ccause\u201d the choice, for\notherwise the ehoice would not be free. Thus, for those who defended\nthis view, the answer to the question of \u201cwhat makes conditional\nfuture contingents true\u201d ought to be \u201cnothing.\u201d For\nif something made future contingents true, then that\nthing would determine the choice, and the choice would not be\nfree.\n\n\nGiven his commitment to the Principle of Sufficient Reason, however,\nLeibniz could not endorse such a view. Does Leibniz, then, have an\nanswer to this question that will rescue him from the holiness\nproblem? There is scholarly disagreement about this issue. Some have\nheld that Leibniz is obliged to hold the postvolitional view despite\nthe difficulties that it raises for him. [See Davidson (1996), Sleigh\n(1994).] Others have held that Leibniz tried to forge a third\nalternative in order to avoid this seemingly intractable dilemma. [See\nMurray (2005); for an alternative to Murray (2005), see Cover and\nHawthorne (2000)]. I will close by considering the latter\nsuggestion.\n\n\nAccording to Leibniz, free choice in humans is brought about through\nthe activity of the human intellect and the human will working in\nconcert with each other. The intellect deliberates about alternatives\nand selects the one that it perceives to be the best, all things\nconsidered. The intellect then represents this alternative to the will\nas the best course of action. The will, which Leibniz takes to be an\n \u201cappetite for the good,\u201d, then chooses the\nalternative represented to it as containing the most goodness\n[Theodicy, 311 (H 314; G VI 300\u20131].\n\n\nOn this view, it appears that there are two ways in which I might\nexercise \u201ccontrol\u201d over my acts of will. First, I might be\nable to control what appears to me to be the best course of action,\nall things considered. That is, I might control the process of\ndeliberation. Second, I might be able to control which alternative is\npresented to the will as containing the greatest good.  Leibniz seems\nto accept both of these possibilities. In certain passages, he argues\nthat by engaging in some sort of moral therapy, I can control which\nthings appear to me to be good, and thus control the outcome of my\ndeliberations. In other passages, he seems to say that while the will\ndoes \u201cinfallibly\u201d choose that which the intellect deems to\nbe the best, the will nevertheless retains the power to resist the\nintellect because the intellect does not \u201ccause\u201d the will\nto choose as it does.  [Concerning the first strategy, see, for\nexample, Reflections on Hobbes, 5 (H 396\u20137; G VI 391\u20131). For\nmore on this aspect of Leibniz's view of freedom see Seidler\n(1985). Concerning the second strategy see, for\nexample Theodicy 282 (H 298\u2013300; G VI 284\u20135).]\n\n\nBoth suggestions face difficulties.  Consider the first. How might I\ngo about engaging in \u201cmoral therapy\u201d?  First, I would have\nto choose to do something to begin to bring about a change in how I\nsee things. But of course I can make a choice to do this only if I\nfirst deliberate about it and see that making this change is the best\nthing for me to do. But did I have control over this process of\n\u201ccoming to see that a change is the best thing for me to\ndo\u201d? It seems that I may have control here only if I have\ncontrol over the actions that led me to see things this way in the\nfirst place. But do I have control over those actions? If the answer\nis yes, it is only because I had control over my prior deliberations,\nand it looks as if this will lead us back in the chain of explanation\nto certain very early formative stages of my moral and intellectual\nlife, stages over which it is hard to believe I had any control. It\ntherefore seems that this line of reasoning will be difficult to\nsustain.\n\n\nLet us consider the second alternative then, according to which I have\ncontrol because the will is never \u201ccausally determined\u201d to\nchoose that which the intellect deems to be best in those\ncircumstances.  Leibniz holds that the will is not causally determined\nin the act of choice but merely \u201cmorally necessitated.\u201d\nThere is scholarly disagreement about the interpretation of this\nphrase. Some think it just means \u201ccausally necessitated.\u201d\nBut if this is right, it appears that God, who establishes the laws of\nnature, determines how creatures act, and this leads us back to the\nsuggestion that Leibniz was a postvolitionalist in these matters. As\nwe noted above, this is a troubling position for Leibniz to adopt\nsince it seems to undermine his response to the holiness problem. [For\nvarious positions on the nature of \u201cmoral necessity,\u201d see\nAdams, pp. 21\u20132, Sleigh (2000), Murray (1995), pp. 95\u2013102,\nand (1996), esp. Section IV].\n\n\nOthers have held that moral necessity is a philosophical novelty,\ninvented to explain the unique relationship between intellect and will.\nOn this view, the will infallibly follows the determination of the intellect,\nwithout thereby being causally determined. Leibniz sometimes hints at\nthis reading, as in the following example derived from Pierre\nNicole:\nIt is considered impossible that a wise and serious\nmagistrate, who has not taken leave of his senses, should publicly\ncommit some outrageous action, as it would be, for instance, to run\nabout the streets naked in order to make people laugh [Theodicy 282\n(H299; G VI 284)]\n\n\nHere, the wise magistrate is not causally determined to refrain from\nstreaking to make people laugh. Instead, he just considers streaking\nto be so unseemly that \u201che can't bring himself to do it.\u201d\nSomething about his psychological constitution prevents him from\nseeing this as something that he might actually do, even though there\nis surely some sense in which he nevertheless\ncould do it. \n\n\nIf we allow Leibniz to locate control over actions in a will that is\nonly morally necessitated by the intellect, is there a way for him to\navoid the postvolitional/prevolitional dilemma discussed earlier? The\nanswer is not obvious. One would have to say that the will's\ninfallibly choosing in accordance with the deliverances of the intellect\nis a fact whose truth is independent of God's will, while\nalso saying that the deliverances of the intellect provide a\nsufficient reason for the will's choice. If this can be done,\nLeibniz may have a way of avoiding the difficulty posed by conditional\nfuture contingents.\n\n\nHowever we might think these questions should be resolved, Leibniz\nhimself appears to have thought that the prevolitional route was the\none to take. He does not think that God makes it the case how human\nbeings would act if they were created; rather, Leibniz believes God\n\"discovers\" in the ideas of the possibles how human beings would act\nif they were created [on this topic see Sleigh (1994).] [Leibniz\nspeaks of these truths about how human beings will act as\n\u201climitations\u201d that prevent God from making them, and the\nworld that contains them, more perfect. In the end, it is these\nlimitations, Leibniz argues, that prevent there from being a better\nworld than the actual one. [On the notion of \u201climitations\u201d\nsee AG 60\u20132, 11, Theodicy 20 (H 86\u20137; G VI\n114\u20135), Causa Dei 69\u201371 (S 128\u201330;\n457\u20138).] If this interpretation is correct, then we might think\nthat the permission strategy will work as a solution to the holiness\nproblem both when it comes to defending God as creator and as\nconcurrent cause of all effects in the cosmos.\n\n\nInterestingly, however, Leibniz comes to favor, in later life, the\nscholastic \u201cprivation\u201d view that he rejected in his\nearliest writings on the problem of evil. [See, for\nexample, Theodicy 20, 30, 153 (respectively, H 86\u20137,\n91\u20132, 219\u201320; G VI 114\u20135, 119\u201320, 201.]\nLeibniz's conception of privation in general, and the relation between\nhis earlier and later views on the topic, has recently received a\nsustained and searching examination in Newlands (forthcoming), to\nwhich readers interested in the topic are directed.\n\n\nThe issues that arise in thinking about Leibniz's views on the problem\nof evil have only in the past couple of decades begun to receive the\nsustained scholarly attention that they deserve in virtue of their\nmanifest significance for Leibniz.  In the last few years in\nparticular\u2013\u2013probably not coincidentally, the\nthree-hundredth anniversary of the publication of\nthe Theodicy was celebrated in 2010\u2013\u2013considerable\ninterpretive attention has been devoted to the details of Leibniz's\ntreatment of the problem of evil and related topics.  [Rateau (2008)\nis the first book-length treatment of Leibniz's work on the problem of\nevil; the essays in Rateau (2011) and Newlands and Jorgensen\n(forthcoming) are devoted to particular topics related to Leibniz's\ntreatment of the problem of evil.]  Given the fact that Leibniz's\ntreatment of the problem of evil draws on medieval sources and also\nwas taken as a target by later writers such as Voltaire and Kant,\nrenewed interest in Leibniz's treatment of the problem of evil,\ncombined with the resurgence of interest in contextual history of\nphilosophy, have inspired recent work on the general historical\nsignificance of Leibniz's work on the problem of evil that seeks to\nilluminate later approaches to the problem of evil as well as the\nnature of the problem of evil itself.  [See, inter alia,\nLarrimore (2004), Neiman (2002), and the essays in Rateau (2009).]  In\nlight of the fact that new translations of Leibniz's central texts\ndevoted to the problem of evil have either only relatively recently\nbeen published (CP) or are in process\u2013\u2013a new edition and\nEnglish translation of the Theodicy, by Sean Greenberg and\nR. C. Sleigh, Jr., is well underway and under contract with Oxford\nUniversity Press\u2013and given that other new texts, like DPW, that\nbear on this nest of issues may well be discovered, there is reason to\nexpect that this topic will continue to be an active area of Leibniz\nscholarship, and therefore that any conclusions about Leibniz's views\non the problem of evil must, for now, remain tentative and subject to\nrevision.\n",
