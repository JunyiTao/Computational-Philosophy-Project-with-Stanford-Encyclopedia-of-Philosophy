    "main_text": "Tarski\u2019s theory of truth || Convention T\n2.2 Convention T\n\nLet us suppose we have a fixed language \\(\\mathbf{L}\\) whose\nsentences are fully interpreted. The basic question Tarski poses is\nwhat an adequate theory of truth for \\(\\mathbf{L}\\) would\nbe. Tarski\u2019s answer is embodied in what he calls Convention\nT:\n\nAn adequate theory of truth for \\(\\mathbf{L}\\) must imply, for\neach sentence \\(\\phi\\) of \\(\\mathbf{L}\\)\n\n\n\\(\\ulcorner \\phi \\urcorner\\) is true if and only if \\(\\phi\\).\n\n\n(We have simplified Tarski\u2019s presentation somewhat.) This is an\nadequacy condition for theories, not a theory itself. Given the\nassumption that \\(\\mathbf{L}\\) is fully interpreted, we may assume\nthat each sentence \\(\\phi\\) in fact has a truth value. In light of this,\nConvention T guarantees that the truth predicate given by the theory\nwill be extensionally correct, i.e., have as its extension\nall and only the true sentences of \\(\\mathbf{L}\\).\n\nConvention T draws our attention to the biconditionals of the form\n\n\\(\\ulcorner \\ulcorner \\phi \\urcorner\\)\nis true if and only if \\(\\phi \\urcorner\\),\n\n\nwhich are usually called the Tarski biconditionals for a\nlanguage \\(\\mathbf{L}\\).\n",
