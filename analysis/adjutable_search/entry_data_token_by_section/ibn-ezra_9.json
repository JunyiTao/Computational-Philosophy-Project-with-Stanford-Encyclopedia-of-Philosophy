    "main_text": "Rationale for the Commandments: Yesod Mora\n11. Philosophical Allegory: Hayy ben Meqitz\n\n\nIbn Ezra has left us one writing that undoubtedly fits into a very\nspecial medieval philosophical tradition: a visionary recital, or\ninitiatory tale, in rhymed Hebrew prose, Hayy ben Meqitz\n(Levin 1985, 119\u2013132). The great tenth century philosopher Ibn Sina\nwrote a philosophical allegory Hayy bin Yaqz\u00e2n, and the\nAndalusian Ibn Tufayl, as well as the Persian expatriate Suhrawardi\npenned distinct versions, each tale suited to the message that its\nauthor wished to convey. Ibn Ezra\u2019s Hebrew composition fits into this\nspecial theme of philosophical allegory.\n\n\n In Ibn Ezra\u2019s version, Hayy is the guide\u2014an old man on whom\ntime has not taken its toll. The narrator, who has fled his home,\nmeets Hayy, who enchants him with words of wisdom, then invites him to\nimmerse himself in the fountain of life and imbibe its waters. Hayy\nthen guides the narrator through eight \u201ckingdoms,\u201d that\nis, the stellar spheres, describing their astrological associations in\nvivid imagery, then to the angelic realm. The narrator asks if is\nthere anything beyond, something that he cannot see? Hayy replies\npositively; there is \u201cthe One, who has no second\u201d, sublime\nand invisible. However, he continues, if the narrator will follow in\nHayy\u2019s path, he will yet be able to know and see Him.\n\n\nThis philosophical tale further complicates the question of Ibn\nEzra\u2019s doctrinal allegiances. Issues such as the structure of\nthe soul or the contours of union with the divine, which are not\ntreated systematically or uniformly elsewhere, cannot be fully\nharmonized with Ibn Ezra\u2019s pronouncements\nelsewhere. Hayy is the only one of Ibn Ezra\u2019s\nphilosophical ventures that has no intrinsic connection to Judaism.\nSnippets of biblical verses are skillfully woven into Hayy,\nmaking the poem amenable to the Jewish reader and making it easier for\nthe reader to answer the invitation\u2014if one is indeed\nextended\u2014to join the excursion under Hayy\u2019s guidance. On\nthe other hand, the ritual immersion in the nude that the narrator\nperforms, while not totally foreign to Judaism, must have seemed to\ncarry Christian overtones to some readers. It should be borne in mind\nthat Ibn Ezra wrote Hayy at the request of Samuel Ibn Jami, a learned\nand philosophically inclined North African Jew, himself a poet. Is\nHayy the response to a literary challenge?\n\n \nGreive (1973, 103\u2013114) characterizes Hayy as \u201ca\nreligious-philosophical work, expressed in a mystical fashion.\u201d\nIt is part of a tradition of Himmelsreisen that stretches\nback to antiquity and is open to a number of interpretations. Three\ncentral moments can be discerned: (1) The soul\u2019s imprisonment in\nthe terrestrial world, which is foreign to her; (2) the role of\nself-knowledge (i.e. coming to know one\u2019s true, other-worldly\nself) in the process of liberation; (3) wisdom as the means to this\nliberation.  Greive explores in particular, the literary connections\nwith Avicenna\u2019s recital, also called \u2018Hayy\u2019, as well\nas Ibn Gabirol\u2019s liturgical masterpiece, Keter\nMalkhut.\n\n \nMore recently, Aaron Hughes (2004, 186) has strongly emphasized the\nneoplatonic aesthetics at play in Hayy, asserting that\naesthetics and poetry are \u201ccurrency whereby the imagination and\nphilosophy are able to tease out and subsequently map the various\nrelationships between the physical and the metaphysical\u201d.\n",
