We turn to his views on scientific method in the more specifically medical context. Galen names three medical \u201csects\u201d, in relation to which he positions his own methodology: the Dogmatists or Rationalists (dogmatikoi, logikoi), the Empiricists (empeirikoi) and the Methodists (methodikoi); and he explores the differences between them especially in SI. In fact, only the latter two names correspond to self-styled groupings with explicit school doctrines; the term Rationalist or Dogmatist, meanwhile, is a catch-all referring to any doctor who functions with a (non-Methodist) theory regarding the internal workings of the body. (See Walzer and Frede 1985, introduction; Hankinson 1991a, 2008a.) The Methodists are a theoretically minimalist sect, who conceptualize the pathology of the body in terms of two basic \u201ccommonalities\u201d (koinot\u0113tes), consisting in increased fluidity or increased restriction through the pathways (poroi) of the body; the Empiricists avoid any statement about physiology, their treatments being based on an inductive procedure from similarity with past cases, the \u201ctransition from the similar\u201d (metabasis tou homoiou), with no commitment to any physiological theory; a Dogmatist may be any (non-Methodist) physician with a theory about the internal workings of the body and about disease aetiology.\nGalen\u2019s greatest hostility is towards Methodists: their theory (such as it is) is simply wrong. The extremity of Galen\u2019s reaction here seems in part related to the very simplicity of their theory. For Galen, medicine is a large and complex art requiring years of training in both logical and clinical disciplines; the Methodists, possibly a consciously anti-intellectual movement representing a non-elite group in society, provocatively claimed that the art could be taught in six months; their minimalist theoretical framework hugely reduces the range of both empirical inputs and theoretical distinctions that can be considered relevant.\nGalen believes that the Empiricist position, avoiding any statement about unseen entities and basing itself entirely on experience (empeiria, peira), will lead to the correct therapeutic result in many cases. Faced with a choice between being a pure Empiricist and adopting an erroneous theory, one should infinitely prefer the former. However, Galen\u2019s view remains that theoretical knowledge of the internal workings of the body is possible\u2014that is, one can deduce facts about the non-evident (ad\u0113la) on the basis of one\u2019s observations. Further, this knowledge of the workings of the body, its phusis, gives one an understanding of pathology\u2014in particular, a differentiated pathology based on a knowledge of the different internal parts and the different forms diseases may take in them, despite superficially similar symptoms\u2014which will in some cases enable one to make the right diagnosis, and therefore prescribe the correct treatment, where the Empiricist would not.\n",
