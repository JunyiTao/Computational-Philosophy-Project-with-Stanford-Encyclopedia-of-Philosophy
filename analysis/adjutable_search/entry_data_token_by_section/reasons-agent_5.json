Why the Distinction Matters\n\nHaving formulated the agent-relative/agent-neutral distinction and\nseen how it differs from other important distinctions, we are now in a\nposition to consider why the distinction is an important one. The\ndistinction has played a very useful role in framing certain\ninteresting and important debates in normative philosophy.\n\nFor a start, the distinction helps frame a challenge to the\ntraditional assumption that what separates so-called consequentialists\nand deontologists is that the former but not the latter are committed\nto the idea that all reasons for action are teleological. A\ndeontological restriction forbids a certain sort of action (e.g.,\nstealing) even when stealing here is the only way to prevent even more\nstealing in the long run. Consequentialists charge that such a\nrestriction must be irrational, on the grounds that if stealing is\nforbidden then it must be bad but if it is bad then surely less\nstealing is better than more. The deontologist can respond in one of\ntwo ways. First, they could hold that deontological restrictions\ncorrespond to non-teleological reasons. The reason not to steal, on\nthis account, is not that stealing is bad in the sense that it should\nbe minimized but rather simply that stealing is forbidden no matter\nwhat the consequences (this is admittedly a stark form of deontology,\nbut there are less stern versions as well). This is indeed one way of\nunderstanding the divide between consequentialists and deontologists,\nbut the agent-relative/agent-neutral distinction, and in particular\nthe idea of agent-relative reasons, brings to the fore an alternative\nconception. For arguably, we could instead understand deontological\nrestrictions as corresponding to a species of reasons which are\nteleological after all so long as those reasons are agent-relative. If\nmy reason not to steal is that I should minimize my stealing then the\nfact that my stealing here would prevent five other people from\ncommitting similar acts of theft does nothing to suggest that I ought\nto steal. To really have any chance of working, the reasons will\nprobably need to be temporally relative as well as agent-relative. For\notherwise the reason corresponding to a deontological restriction will\ngive me reason to steal now if this is the only way to prevent me from\nstealing even more\n later.[6]\n If the reasons in play are agent-relative then perhaps the\ndeontologist can do more to defuse the consequentialist\u2019s charge\nof paradox, though other problems now arise. The deontologist now can\nlook overly self-indulgent, so obsessed with the purity of her own\nsoul that she will not sacrifice her integrity for the greater good\n(see Ridge 2001a). Another worry is that reasons which are both\nagent-relative and temporally relative are not really teleological\nafter all in any interesting sense. For the only way to promote an\naction right now is simply by performing it. The broader and\nmore standard conception of promoting an action by causing it simply\nhas no foothold here, and if it did then the proposal would not\ncorrespond exactly with deontological intuitions. In spite of these\nworries, many philosophers have characterized the reasons\ncorresponding to deontological restrictions as agent-relative. Indeed,\nthe characterization of deontological restrictions as agent-relative\n(or agent-centered) is close to being an\n orthodoxy.[7]\n\n\nIf we can properly understand the reasons corresponding to\ndeontological restrictions as agent-relative (and temporally relative)\nteleological reasons but teleological reasons all the same then in\neffect we can, as James Dreier puts it, \u2018consequentialize\u2019\ndeontology, surprisingly enough. The apparent success of deploying\nagent-relativity to \u2018consequentialize\u2019 deontology leads\nDreier to defend the more bold hypothesis that any moral\ntheory can be represented as a form of consequentialism so long as we\nare willing to allow that consequentialism comes in agent-relative as\nwell as agent-neutral versions. The central idea behind\nconsequentialism, on this way of thinking, is its teleology and\ncommitment to maximizing, both of which seem compatible with\nagent-relativity about that which is\n maximized.[8]\n If Dreier is right about this then the agent-relative/agent-neutral\ndistinction may be more important than the distinction between\nconsequentialist theories and non-consequentialist theories.\n\nAnother advantage of the agent-relative/agent-neutral distinction is\nthat it can bring to our attention important structural differences\nbetween what might otherwise seem like very similar normative\ntheories. For example, a theory which holds that our overriding reason\nis always to maximize actual utility seems very similar in spirit to a\ntheory which instead holds that our overriding reason is always to\nmaximize expected utility. One would naturally have thought\nthat both of these theories are agent-neutral so long as we assume\nthat utility is understood in agent-neutrally (in terms of general\nhappiness, e.g.). However, the reference to \u2018expected\u2019\nutility in the second theory actually seems to entail that the reasons\ncorresponding to that theory are agent-relative. For presumably the\nrelevant expectations are the agent\u2019s, in which case we will\nneed to mark this with a free agent variable and that free agent\nvariable hardly seems\n trivial.[9]\n This is a surprising result, but there is no obvious way to block it\non the conception of agent-relativity proposed here (or on the\nclassical principle-based conceptions defended by Nagel, Parfit or\neven on the reason-statement-based version of the distinction defended\nby Pettit). This could itself be illuminating. Perhaps it suggests\nthat we need to draw a fundamental distinction between value and\nreasons, contra T.M. Scanlon and others who see value claims as really\njust indicating the presence of reasons; see Scanlon\u2019s\ndiscussion of the \u2018buck-passing account in Scanlon (1998). For\nsuch a distinction would allow us to say that while happiness is an\nagent-neutral good (thereby accommodating the intuition that there is\nsomething agent-neutral about the second theory) our reasons to\npromote that good are best understood in terms of the agent\u2019s\nexpectations and hence agent-relative.\n\nNor should we forget that the first real use of the\nagent-relative/agent-neutral distinction was Nagel\u2019s in The\nPossibility of Altruism. There Nagel tried to prove that all\nreasons must be agent-neutral on pain of a kind of practical\nsolipsism. Nagel eventually abandoned this argument in light of\nobjections from Nicholas Sturgeon (see Sturgeon 1974), but the\nargument is ingenious and Nagel may have abandoned it prematurely. If\nany such argument could ever be made to work then we might be able to\nsettle a wide range of difficult issues in normative philosophy\nwithout simply appealing to first-order intuitions about cases which\nso often seems to lead to philosophical stalemate. Moreover, if an\nargument like Nagel\u2019s could be made to work then its\nimplications would be dramatic. Not only egoistic reasons but arguably\ndeontological reasons and reasons arising out of special relations to\none\u2019s nearest and dearest would stand refuted, as would what\nNagel later referred to as \u2018reasons of autonomy\u2019 (see\nNagel 1986: 165). Furthermore, Nagel is not the only one to have\noffered abstract considerations in favor of the thesis that all\nreasons are agent-neutral. For example, some of Derek Parfit\u2019s\nwork on personal identity is supposed to undermine the importance of\npersonal identity as such, and that in turn might undermine the\ntenability of agent-relativity (see Parfit 1984).\n\nThe agent-relative/agent-neutral distinction was also invaluable in\nJames Dreier\u2019s exploration of the often neglected issue of how\nan expressivist might make sense of agent-relative norms (see Dreier\n1996). Dreier\u2019s argument is subtle and complex, and we shall not\ntry to reproduce it here. The point for present purposes is that his\ndiscussion highlights an important challenge for expressivists.\nAdmittedly, a more narrow version of this challenge was previously\nseen by Brian Medlin (see Medlin 1957), whose work heavily influenced\nDreier. However, Medlin cast the challenge specifically in terms of\negoistic reasons and that has important dialectical implications. As\nDreier points out, Medlin\u2019s challenge applies to agent-centered\nnorms more generally and this wider scope matters. For we might well\nbe willing to abandon egoistic reasons, but if we also had to give up\non the intelligibility of deontology then the costs of expressivism\nmight well begin to seem too steep. Until Nagel and others drew the\nagent-relative/agent-neutral distinction, it was easy enough for\nphilosophers like Medlin to not fully appreciate the scope and power\nof their own arguments.\n\nFinally, the agent-relative/agent-neutral distinction can also provide\na useful lens through which to examine some of the arguments of\nhistorical figures. Sidgwick\u2019s famous discussion of the\n\u2018dualism of practical reason\u2019 can now be seen as an\ninstance of the more general tension between agent-relative and\nagent-neutral reasons. G.E. Moore\u2019s argument against ethical\negoism would, if sound, refute agent-relative conceptions more\ngenerally (see Moore 1903: 96\u2013105), since Moore\u2019s main\nobjection is not to egoism in particular but (in effect) to\nagent-relative conceptions of the good more generally.\n\nAlso, there is an interesting debate about whether Kantian moral\nprohibitions must be understood as agent-relative even if we allow\nthat all reasons are teleological (see Ridge 2009; compare Huckfeldt\n2007 and Dougherty 2013). The strategy is to understand the end to be\npromoted in agent-neutral terms, but also in such a way that the agent\nat any given point in time can best promote that agent-neutral aim\nonly by acting in accord with suitable deontological rules. One key\nidea behind this strategy is that the relevant end is \u201cgood\nwilling\u201d understood in a broadly Kantian way, combined with a\nrobust theory of free will according to which one agent cannot ever\nfully control the will of another. The other key idea is that the\nagent-neutral teleological reasons in play are compatible with a\nnon-maximizing theory of right action. In particular, the idea will be\nthat the agent must always minimize the risk of the very worst of the\navailable outcomes. If the very worst of the available outcomes is\nthat everyone has a bad will, then one can ensure that the risk of\nthat outcome is zero by preserving one\u2019s own good will. Given\nthat one cannot in this way fully control the will of another, the\nneeded self/other asymmetry is preserved without agent-relativity in\nthe theory of reasons or value. A suitable theory of right action and\nfree will can do the work that would otherwise require an\nagent-relative theory of reasons or value. \n",
