Objection (2): Although it is a fact that the\nexistent present King of France or, respectively, the\nexistent round square does not exist, one also has to\nconclude (using the characterization principle; see Section 5.1 above)\nthat he/it does exist. Russell thinks he can provide a radical cure\nfor Meinong\u2019s inconsistencies by applying his theory of\ndescriptions, which treats definite (and indefinite) descriptions as\nincomplete symbols that are to be eliminated in favor of existential\nquantification and predicates. According to Russell, the problems\ninvolved stem from the mistaken view that the grammatical form of\nlanguage always shows its logical form, and that if an expression\nmeans something, there must always be some thing that it means. But\nwhile denoting phrases such as \u201cThe so-and-so\u201d\nlook like referring expressions they are, in fact, nothing of the\nsort. It is because Meinong wrongly assumes that such expressions are\nreferring expressions whose meaning is what they refer to that his\ntheory is apt to infringe logical laws.\n5.4.2 Meinong\u2019s Answers\n\nMeinong answered objection (1) by denying that beingless objects must\nobey the law of noncontradiction \u2014 only actual and possible\nobjects do (1907, \u00a73: 16). On the contrary, thinking about\nimpossibilia makes the suspension of the law of noncontradiction\nindispensable. Meinong\u2019s later appeal to the above-mentioned\ndistinction between negation in a wider and narrower sense (5.2.1)\nshows that he meant only the law of noncontradiction in its\ntraditional, ontological and not in its logical, propositional form.\nAccording to Meinong\u2019s characterization principle, the round\nsquare is both round and non-round, but it is not the case that (i)\nthe round square is round and (ii) the round square is not round\n(i.e., it is not the case that the round square is round). The\ntriangle is neither green nor non-green, but nevertheless it is either\nthe case that the triangle is green or it is not the case that it is\ngreen. In such cases, Meinong does not accept that the predicate\nnegation \u201cA is non-B\u201d is equivalent to\nthe sentence-negation \u201cNot (A is B)\u201d.\nThe equivalence of both kinds of negation\n\u201c(~F)x \u2194 \u00ac(Fx)\u201d does\nnot hold for impossibilia and incomplete objects but only for actual\nand possible objects where \u201cpossible\u201d seems to be taken in\na strong sense that relates possibility with completeness: \u201cOnly\ncomplete objects are possible\u201d Meinong says in a lecture note\ndating from 1910 (1978: 228). (To see that there is still a problem\nleft, see 5.2.1 above; cf. also Swanson 2011 which criticizes\nMeinong\u2019s distinction between narrow and wide negation and\nargues that Russell\u2019s account is to be preferred to a\n(Neo-)Meinongian view.)\n\nMeinong\u2019s reply to objection (2) consists in stressing the\ndistinction between \u201cbeing existing\u201d\n[Existierend-Sein] as a determination of so-being and\n\u201cexistence\u201d (\u201cto exist\u201d [Existieren])\nas a determination of being. Meinong\u2019s distinction between\njudgements of so-being and judgements of being, combined with the\nindifference principle that being does not belong to the\nobject\u2019s nature (so-being), reminds one of Kant\u2019s dictum\nthat being is not a real predicate. Meinong did not accept the\nontological argument either, and argued that \u201cbeing\nexisting\u201d is a determination of so-being and can in a certain\nsense be properly accepted even of the object \u201cexisting golden\nmountain,\u201d and, say, even of the object \u201cexisting round\nsquare,\u201d whereas \u201cexistence\u201d, which is a\ndetermination of being, will no more belong to the one than it does to\nthe other (1907, \u00a73; 1910, \u00a720: 141 [105]). In\nother words, according to the characterization principle both the\nexisting round square and the existing golden mountain (Russell 1907\nuses \u201cexistent\u201d) are existing (existent), but nevertheless\nthey do not exist. Russell (1907, 439) could not see any difference\nbetween \u201cbeing existent\u201d and \u201cto exist\u201d and\nhad \u201cno more to say on this head.\u201d With that, the\npublished debate on nonentities came to an end.\n5.4.3 The Nuclear/Extra-nuclear Distinction and the Modal Moment\n\nThat there is indeed a difference between \u201cbeing existing\n(existent)\u201d and \u201cto exist\u201d can also be made clear by\na distinction Meinong took over from Mally, the distinction between\ntwo kinds of properties (determinations), nuclear versus\nextra-nuclear properties [konstitutorische versus\nau\u00dferkonstitutorische Bestimmungen] (1915, \u00a725).\nThe nuclear properties of an object are the properties characterizing\nthe nature of a presented object \u2014 what we might call its\n\u201cordinary\u201d (constitutive and consecutive) properties\n\u2014, and the extra-nuclear properties of an object are those\nproperties that are neither a constitutive nor a consecutive part of\nits nature. Some of the extra-nuclear properties may supervene on the\nnature of the object, some may not. According to the characterization\nprinciple, the round square, for instance, is round and a square,\ni.e., it is determined by the nuclear properties being round and being\na square. Being thought of by someone, on the other hand, can\nbe seen as an extra-nuclear property of the round square which does\nnot supervene on it. Nevertheless, the round square has as its\nsupervening extra-nuclear determinations such properties as being\ndetermined by the (nuclear) property round, being determined\nby two (nuclear) properties, being undetermined by the\nproperty red, being incomplete, being\ncontradictorily determined, and having non-being.\nSimilarly, the object a red (thing) [ein\nRotes] is just red, has only red as its nuclear\ndetermination, and can, therefore, be called a \u201csimple\nobject\u201d, with simplicity being one of its supervening\nextra-nuclear determinations (another is being-incomplete).\n\nIf an extra-nuclear property like simplicity were treated as a further\n\u201cordinary\u201d, characterizing property, one would be caught\nup in a contradiction: As the object a red thing is a simple\nobject, it has two properties, redness and simplicity, and is,\ntherefore, not simple but complex. The introduction of the\nnuclear/extra-nuclear distinction allows us to avoid this\ncontradiction. Without it Meinong would also have had problems holding\nthe principle that every particular triangle has all the\nproperties that belong to the (incomplete) object the triangle in\nabstracto (the triangle as such). Particular triangles\nare triangles, have three sides etc., and they are complete, but\naccording to the mentioned principle, they would also be\nincomplete.\n\nFurthermore, Meinong states that one can treat [behandeln]\nsuch determinations like complete in two ways: as an\nextra-nuclear determination but also as a nuclear one. If one\nconsiders an object through its three nuclear determinations\ncomplete, brown, and quadrangle one has not\nyet decided the question whether one intends the object to have the\nextra-nuclear determination of completeness. But one can do this\nsimply by attributing the extra-nuclear version of the determination\ncomplete. Meinong just trusts in the ability of the\nextra-nuclear function of the determination complete to\nensure that one intends a complete object, and he only wonders about\nthe reason that makes a determination nuclear or extra-nuclear (1915,\n\u00a726: 189\u201390). Our mental powers are limited as our human\nmind cannot take in the infinity of the determinations of complete\nobjects. Despite this limitation we can think and speak about the\nworld and hit [treffen] an existing and, therefore, complete\nobject because we consider an object that is incomplete to be complete\nin its extra-nuclear version. The object hit by the incomplete object\nthat is present to the mind (and functions as an \u201cauxiliary\nobject\u201d) is called the \u201ctarget object\u201d (more about\nthis in 6 below). Nevertheless, our thinking of things in the world\nwith the aid of auxiliary objects and the extra-nuclear determinations\nmay fail. If you think \u201cthe golden mountain\u201d in this way\nthere is no corresponding target object that exists; there is only the\nincomplete object that does not exist (cf. 1915: 740). It is worth\nnoting that you can also hit incomplete objects by this method. You\nsucceed in hitting the incomplete object the triangle as such\nwhen you simply think the object the triangle with the\nextra-nuclear determination of incompleteness (1915, \u00a726:\n191\u20132).\n\nMeinong does not explicitly apply the nuclear/extra-nuclear\ndistinction to the being existent/to exist case. This is done in some\nlogical reconstructions of Meinong\u2019s object theory which favor a\ndual property approach (for example, Parsons 1980; Routley 1980;\nJacquette 1996; see below 5.4.4 and the entry on\n nonexistent objects).\n\nIn order to explain his view, Meinong resorts to the notions of the\nmodal moment and watered-down factuality\n[depotenzierte Tats\u00e4chlichkeit] (1915,\n\u00a7\u00a737\u201338). Objectives can be assumed to be\nsubsistent (factual), although, actually, they do not subsist (are\nnonfactual). For instance, we can imagine that it is a fact that\nsquares are round. This assumption has as its object the fact that\nsquares are round; nevertheless this assumption is directed to a\nnon-subsistent (nonfactual) objective. On the one hand (according to\nthe characterization principle), the objective the fact that\nsquares are round is a fact; on the other hand (as the objective\nin question cannot subsist), it is not a fact. Meinong explains away\nthe discrepancy with the introduction of two readings of\n\u201cfact\u201d. The second reading, as Findlay (1963: 103\u20134)\nputs it, concerns factuality in a \u201cfull-strength\u201d sense,\nwhereas the first reading is about factuality in a\n\u201cwatered-down\u201d sense. The watered-down version fails a\nfeature that the full-strength version has: Meinong calls it\n\u201cthe modal moment\u201d. In pure, counterfactual imagination we\ncan correctly assume the watered-down version of factuality\nbut we cannot correctly assume the full-strength version of it \u2014\nthere seems to be a lack of freedom of assumption, Meinong thinks\n(1915, \u00a737: 282).\n\nMeinong thinks that one cannot unrestrictedly apply analytic sentences\nto the sphere of being. Analytically true sentences like \u201cA\n(The) BA is B\u201d do not imply the full\nfactuality of the being of the objects involved. The factuality of the\nbeing of a B, the being of an A, and the being of a\nBA, respectively, is \u201cwatered down\u201d in such a\nsentence \u2014 it lacks the modal moment. According to this view,\n\u201cThe sun is the sun\u201d or \u201cThe eclipsed sun is\neclipsed\u201d has more than one reading. On the interpretation of\nthese sentences as purely analytic, no claim as to the existence of\nthe sun or an eclipsed object is made. However, if an existential\nclaim is implied, the sentences could be false; they are not purely\nanalytic anymore. The terms \u201cthe sun\u201d and \u201cthe\neclipsed sun\u201d may express the pure objects (without any\nexistential commitment), or they may express the actual (eclipsed) sun\nthat exists. But this existence claim is an extra claim and cannot be\ngained through an analytic formula.\n\nBecause of this, only \u201cThe existent B is\nexistent\u201d, where no existential claim is made, can be analytic.\nIn thinking \u201cThe existent B is existent\u201d, one can\napprehend the existence of B, but one cannot grasp the\ngenuine factuality of B\u2019s existence. In order to do so,\none would also have to encounter the factually existing object and\nthereby learn this fact of being (= the objective of being\nwith the modal moment). One may even assert \u201cThe B\nwhich exists exists\u201d, but if this sentence is to be understood\nas analytic, it can only be interpreted as a variant of \u201cThe\nexistent B is existent\u201d. In short, it is in no way\nwithin one\u2019s mental power to determine objectively which\nobjectives have the modal moment. The principle of unrestricted\nfreedom of assumption thus finds a limit with respect to the modal\nmoment. Concerning the sentence \u201cThe existent round square\nexists\u201d, Meinong thinks that it is either analytically true (and\nno existential claim is made) or it is the expression of an\nevidentially false judgement because there exists no round square. It\nfollows that for Meinong it is not possible to apply the\ncharacterization principle to cases where the existence of the objects\nis presupposed to be a fact (cf. Jorgensen 2002b).\n5.4.4 Meinong\u2019s Impact on Modern Logic and Semantics\n\nMeinong\u2019s conception of beingless objects has proved to have\nuseful applications in intentional contexts where simple applications\nof Russell\u2019s theory of descriptions do not work. Consider the\nfollowing:\n\nMeinong believed that the round square is round.\n\n\nThis is true, but Russell\u2019s theory of definite descriptions\nimplies that it is false. Depending on whether the scope of the\ndescription is wide or narrow, this sentence permits two possible\nanalyses:\n\n\nThere exists exactly one round square, and Meinong believed that it is\nround.\n\nMeinong believed that there exists exactly one round square, and that\nit is round.\n\n\nThe first analysis is false, because no round square exists. The\nsecond is false, because Meinong did not believe in the existence of\nthe round square (Routley 1980: 118\u20139; Simons 1992: 184\u20135;\nPriest 2005: 109\u201310; cf. Casta\u00f1eda 1974: 6\u201310).\n\nIt is controversial whether Russell\u2019s interpretation was\nna\u00efve or whether there was indeed a na\u00efve Meinong whom\nRussell rightly criticized. In fact, many modern logico-semantical\n\u201cre-constructions\u201d and philosophical interpretations show\na Meinongian object theory that is not na\u00efve but tenable and\nfruitful. Russell\u2019s claim that Meinong\u2019s theory is\ninternally inconsistent can be refuted. There are at least three main\naccounts that overcome the na\u00efvety (cf. the entries on\n nonexistent objects,\n Sections 4 & 5, and on\n existence,\n section 2): (1) The first consists in the elaboration of\nMally\u2019s nuclear/extra-nuclear distinction, which Meinong\nadopted. Routley and (in particular) Parsons (in addition to authors\nlike Jacquette) are in accord with this dual-property approach. (2)\nAnother strategy is the dual-copula approach which has its origin in\nMally\u2019s distinction between an object\u2019s being determined\n[determiniert sein] by a property and an object\u2019s\nsatisfying [erf\u00fcllen] a property (Mally 1912; see entry\non\n Ernst Mally).\n On this approach, Mally\u2019s distinction is interpreted as a\ndistinction between two modes of predication of properties, namely, in\nZalta\u2019s terms, between \u201cencoding\u201d and\n\u201cexemplifying\u201d a property. Sympathetic to the dual-copula\napproach are, for instance, Casta\u00f1eda, Rapaport, Zalta,\nPasniczek, and Reicher. (3) Adopting a paraconsistent logic, that is,\na logic in which inconsistencies do not imply everything, is a further\nattempt to confine the infringement of fundamental logical principles\n(Routley, Priest). One version of such an approach is Berto and\nPriest\u2019s Modal Meinongianism, so-named because\n\u201ccharacterization is understood with reference to worlds other\nthan the actual\u201d, including impossible worlds (Berto &\nPriest 2014: 184).\n",
