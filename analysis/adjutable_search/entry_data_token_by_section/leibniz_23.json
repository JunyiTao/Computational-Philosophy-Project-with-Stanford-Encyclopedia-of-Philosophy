    "main_text": "Epistemology || Innate Ideas\n6.3 Innate Ideas\n\n\nLeibniz is often put in the camp of rationalists and opposed to the\nempiricists (for example, Locke, Berkeley, and Hume). While there are\ngood grounds to be unhappy with this standard textbook distinction,\nLeibniz does fit the bill in two important respects: he is a\nrationalist insofar as he holds to the Principle of Sufficient Reason,\nand he is a rationalist insofar as he accepts innate ideas and denies\nthat the mind is at birth a tabula rasa or blank slate. In\nterms of Leibniz's classical allegiances, it is interesting to see\nthat in the realm of metaphysics, he often couched his philosophy in\nAristotelian (and Scholastic) terms but that in the realm of\nepistemology, he was a fairly open Platonist \u2013 at least in terms\nof the existence of innate ideas. Indeed, in the opening passages of\nhis New Essays on Human Understanding, his book-length\ncommentary on Locke's Essay Concerning Human Understanding,\nLeibniz explicitly aligns himself with Plato on the fundamental\nquestion of the origin of ideas. (A VI vi 48/RB 48)\n\n\nLeibniz has several straightforwardly metaphysical\nreasons for denying that the mind could be a tabula rasa.\nFirst, and most obvious, since there can be no genuine causal\ninteraction among substances, then there could be no way that all our\nideas could come from experience; indeed, no ideas could, strictly\nspeaking, come from experience. (Leibniz will, however, adopt a more\nliberal understanding of sense experience, so that this is not mooted\ntout court.) But, second, and rarely remarked upon, Leibniz\nbelieves that the view that our minds are blank slates at birth violates\nthe Principle of the Identity of Indiscernibles. In short, PII works\nagainst qualitatively identical physical atoms and against\nqualitatively identical (because blank) souls. Further, in one\ntelling passage, he shows us the metaphysical underpinnings of the\nempiricist view that he finds so objectionable. He writes,\n\u201cExperience is necessary, I admit, if the soul is to be given\nsuch and such thoughts, and if it is to take heed of the ideas that are\nwithin us. But how could experience and the senses provide the ideas?\nDoes the soul have windows? Is it similar to writing-tablets, or like\nwax? Clearly, those who take this view of the soul are treating it as\nfundamentally corporeal\u201d (A VI vi 110/RB 110). Locke famously\nentertained the possibility of \u201cthinking matter\u201d, and\nLeibniz found such a thesis abhorrent. Throughout his career, Leibniz\nexpresses no doubt that the human mind or soul is essentially\nimmaterial, and Locke's skepticism about the nature of substance\nis fundamentally at odds with Leibniz's most deeply held\nphilosophical commitments. But, of course, the consequence of this is\nthat Leibniz seeks to undermine Locke's position with respect to\nthe origin and nature of ideas. That the mind, according to Leibniz,\nmust be essentially immaterial has been shown above in the\nsection on metaphysics. But Leibniz does have a particular argument for\nthe mind's immateriality or against its mechanism that concerns\nthe nature of thought and ideas. This is his famous metaphor of a mill,\nwhich comes forth both in the New Essays and the\nMonadology. According to Leibniz, perceptions cannot be\nexplained in mechanical or materialistic terms. Even if one were to\ncreate a machine to which one attributes thought and the presence of\nperceptions, inspection of the interior of this machine would not show\nthe experience of thoughts or perceptions, only the motions of\nvarious parts.\n\n\nBut even when Leibniz accepts the common way of speaking \u2013 that\nis, as if the senses are causally responsible for some ideas \u2013 he\nhas arguments against the empiricist claim that the senses are the\norigin of all ideas. According to Leibniz, while the\nempiricist position can explain the source of contingent truths, it\ncannot adequately explain the origin and character of necessary truths.\nFor the senses could never arrive at the universality of any necessary\ntruth; they can, at best, provide us with the means of making a\nrelatively strong induction. Rather, it is the understanding itself,\nLeibniz claims, which is the source of such truths and which guarantees\ntheir very necessity. While we are not aware of all our ideas at any\ntime \u2013 a fact demonstrated by the function and role of memory\n\u2013 certain ideas or truths are in our minds as dispositions or\ntendencies. This is what is meant by an innate idea or an innate truth.\nIndeed, Leibniz believes that the mind has a \u201cspecial\naffinity\u201d for necessary truths. On this subject, Leibniz uses a\ndistinctive metaphor: a piece of marble has veins that indicate or are\ndisposed to indicate shapes that a skillful sculptor can discover and exploit.\nSimilarly, there is a \u201cdisposition, an aptitude, a preformation,\nwhich determines our soul and brings it about that [necessary truths]\nare derivable from it\u201d (A VI vi 80/RB 80). \n",
