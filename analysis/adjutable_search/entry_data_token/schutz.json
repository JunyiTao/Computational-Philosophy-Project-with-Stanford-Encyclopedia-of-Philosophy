Life and Influence\n\nVienna-born Alfred Schutz joined the artillery division of the\nAustrian army during World War I and served on the Italian front\nbefore returning to pursue studies at the University of Vienna. There\nSchutz studied law, social science, and business with renowned figures\nsuch as Hans Kelsen and Ludwig von Mises, but his most significant\neducational experience occurred while he was a member of the Mises\nCircle, one of many Viennese circles, of which the \u201cSchlick\nCircle\u201d was the most famous. In the interdisciplinary Mises\nCircle, Schutz formed friendships that would continue throughout the\ncataclysmic decades of the 1930s and 1940s and that included, among\nothers, economists Gottfried von Haberler, Friedrich A. von Hayek,\nFritz Machlup, Oskar Morgenstern, philosopher Felix Kaufmann, and\npolitical scientist Eric Voegelin. While continuing to pursue his\nacademic interests, in 1927 Schutz was named executive officer of\nReitler and Company, a leading Viennese banking firm with\ninternational business relations, and thus he commenced a life-long\npattern that led Edmund Husserl to describe him as \u201ca banker by\nday and a philosopher by night.\u201d\n\nFrom the beginning, Schutz had been taken with the methodological\nwritings of Max Weber, who had lectured in Vienna in the summer of\n1918 and whose work was immensely popular among Viennese\nintellectuals. However, Schutz felt that Weber\u2019s work rested on\ntacit, unexamined presuppositions resulting from his lack of interest\nin fundamental epistemological problems that had no direct bearing on\nhis special sociological problems. In 1925\u20131927, Schutz turned\nto Henri Bergson\u2019s philosophy of consciousness and inner time in\norder to clarify notions such as meaning, action, and\nintersubjectivity, and his results have been collected in manuscripts\npublished as Life Forms and Meaning Structure. Dissatisfied,\nthough, with his analyses of temporality to the extent that he never\npublished them and prompted by comments of Felix Kaufmann, he\ndiscovered the relevance of the phenomenology of the consciousness of\ninner time of Edmund Husserl (1859\u20131938). He then went on to\nproduce his major life\u2019s work, The Phenomenology of the\nSocial World (1932), a work for which Husserl praised him as\n\u201can earnest and profound phenomenologist.\u201d He spent the\nrest of the 1930s authoring brief essays showing how his phenomenology\nof the social world could come to terms with the economic thought of\nMises and Hayek. Also, before any direct encounter with American\npragmatism, he developed a manuscript on personality in the social\nworld that stressed the pragmatic elements of the everyday social\nworld.\n\nSchutz\u2019s career, academic and business, was thoroughly convulsed\nwhen Adolf Hitler implemented the annexation (Anschluss) of\nAustria by Germany on March 13, 1938, especially since he, on a\nbusiness trip in Paris, was separated for three months from his own\nfamily, whose emigration to Paris he finally arranged. As an\ninternational lawyer and businessperson, he was able to assist\nnumerous intellectuals to escape Austria, but the westward movement of\nthe Nazi juggernaut eventually compelled him to immigrate with his\nfamily to the United States on July 14, 1939.\n\nIn the United States, he continued assisting immigrants and working\nwith Reitler and Company in reestablishing its business, and he\nsupported the United States war effort by reporting on German and\nAustrian economic matters for the Board of Economic Warfare. He also\ncooperated with Marvin Farber in founding the International\nPhenomenological Society, whose initial turf-battles he often\nmediated, and in instituting and editing Philosophy and\nPhenomenological Research. In 1943, Schutz began teaching\nsociology and philosophy courses on The Graduate Faculty of The New\nSchool for Social Research, and his responsibilities included\npresenting papers in the school-wide General Seminar, supervising\ndissertations, and serving as chair of the Philosophy Department from\n1952\u20131956. In spite of his many activities, he managed to carry\non an extensive philosophical correspondence with Farber, Aron\nGurwitsch, Fritz Machlup, Eric Voegelin, and Maurice Natanson, his\ngraduate student from 1951 to 1953. However, to date, only the\ncorrespondences with Gurwitsch and Voegelin have been published. While\nin the United States, Schutz published a collection of articles on a\nwide variety of topics, explaining and criticizing Husserl\u2019s\nthought; examining the works of American philosophers such as William\nJames or George Santanyana; engaging continental philosophers such as\nMax Scheler or Jean-Paul Sartre; developing his own philosophical\npositions on the social sciences, temporality, language, multiple\nrealities, responsibility, and symbolism; addressing socio-political\nquestions dealing with strangers, homecomers, well-informed citizens,\nand equality; and treating themes in literature and music.\n\nSeveral thinkers have continued Schutz\u2019s tradition in philosophy\nand sociology, such as Maurice Natanson who emphasized the tension\nbetween individual, existential and social, anonymizing dimensions of\neveryday life experience. Thomas Luckmann, who served as co-author for\nthe posthumous publication of Schutz\u2019s The Structures of the\nLife-World, developed the sociology of knowledge implications of\nSchutz\u2019s thought and stressed the differences between science\nand the life-world as well as the importance of language, symbolism,\nand the moral order of society. While John O\u2019Neill has fused\nSchutz\u2019s thought with that of Merleau-Ponty by focusing on the\nlived, communicative body, Richard Grathoff has investigated the\nexperience of normality within the bounded and situated context of a\nmilieu. Ilja Srubar developed the pragmatic dimensions of\nSchutz\u2019s thought and several of its economic and political\nimplications, Lester Embree clarified his typology of the sciences,\nand Fred Kersten has expanded his aesthetic insights. Drawing on\nSchutz\u2019s thought, Harold Garfinkel launched ethnomethodology,\nand George Psathas, a commentator on ethnomethodology, played a key\nrole initiating the new discipline of conversation analysis. Several\nother scholars worldwide have dedicated themselves to Schutz\u2019s\nwork and to the development of his insights, and Germany, Japan, and\nthe United States are home to archives containing Schutz\u2019s work\nand correspondence.\n2. The Phenomenology of the Social World\n\nIn his principal work, Schutz placed three chapters of philosophical\ndiscussion between introductory and concluding chapters that discussed\nthe social scientific positions his philosophy attempted to engage. In\nthe initial chapter Schutz praised Max Weber\u2019s views on\nvalue-freedom in social science and the autonomy of science\nvis-\u00e0-vis other activities (e.g. politics), and he commended\nWeber\u2019s methodological individualism and ideal-type methodology.\nIn addition, he applauded Weber\u2019s refusal to reduce the social\nsciences to the natural sciences, while allowing their ideal-typical\nresults to be testable for adequacy. However, Schutz also supplemented\nWeber, pointing out how interpretation was involved even in selecting\nan experience out of one\u2019s stream of experience and highlighting\nhow the meaning of an action to an actor depended upon the project\nguiding the extended temporal process of the sub-acts leading to its\nrealization.\n\nThese initial criticisms of Weber required Schutz to develop his\nown theory of meaning and action, beginning with\nHusserl\u2019s study of the consciousness of internal time, in\nparticular consciousness\u2019s capacity to capture reflectively and\ndistinguish lived experiences, which at first appear as undefined\nphases melting into each other. Schutz had appropriated this notion of\nflowing consciousness, or duration, from Bergson, on whom he\nhad relied in the manuscripts later published as Life Forms and\nMeaning Structure. Those manuscripts, for analytic purposes,\nsplit the ego, indivisible in its lived experience, into ideal-typical\nconstructs of various life forms, that included the \u201cI\u201d\nliving in duration, remembering, acting, thinking, and relating to a\n\u201cThou.\u201d Though Schutz never made explicit his reasons for\nnot publishing those earlier manuscripts, Helmut Wagner rightly\nspeculated that he was ill at ease since one could only have access to\nduration through acts of memory, which, of course, constituted a\nlife-form entirely separate from duration itself. As a result of this\nmethodology relying on distinct ideal-types, duration began to appear\nas an inaccessible Ding-an-sich. Husserl\u2019s account of\nthe consciousness of inner time remedied just this problem by\ncarefully describing how the stream of duration was changed at every\nmoment into a remembered having-just-been-thus, as the primal\nimpression passed into into primary remembrance, or retention. The\ncontinuum extending backward from the now of the primal\nimpression through its retentions formed a \u201cspecious\u201d\npresent, to which the reflective acts of secondary remembrance, that\nis, recollection or reproduction, turned, differentiating one\nexperience from another. In sum, Husserl\u2019s phenomenological\ndescription of experience uncovered the process of retention that\nbridged the duration/(reflective) memory gap that had bedeviled\nSchutz\u2019s earlier efforts insofar as he had relied on an\nideal-typical methodology, which prevented insight into what goes on\nwithin conscious processes themselves.\n\nSchutz, though, turned the Husserlian account of temporality in the\ndirection of an action theory, demarcating levels of passive\nexperience (e.g. bodily reflexes), spontaneous activity without a\nguiding project (e.g., acts of noticing environmental stimuli), and\ndeliberately planned and projected activity, known technically as\n\u201caction\u201d (e.g., writing a book). In planning an action to\nbe realized in the future, one relies on reflective acts of\n\u201cprojection,\u201d like those found in reflective memory, only\nnow oriented in a future as opposed to past direction. Through such\nreflectivity, one imagines a project as completed in future perfect\ntense, that is, what will have been realized after one\u2019s acting,\nand this project, also of central importance for Martin Heidegger and\nthe pragmatist tradition, establishes the \u201cin-order-to\nmotive\u201d of one\u2019s action. By contrast, one\u2019s\n\u201cbecause motives\u201d consist in the environmental, historical\nfactors that influenced the (now past) decision to embark upon the\nproject and that can only be discovered by investigating in the\n\u201cpluperfect tense,\u201d that is, exploring those past factors\nthat preceded that past decision.\n\nSchutz\u2019s distinctions here are relevant to contemporary debates\nabout whether freedom is compatible with determinism since from the\nperspective of the lived in-order-to motive, one experiences oneself\nas free and morally responsible, but from the perspective of examining\none\u2019s because motives after completing one\u2019s action, one\ncorrelates, as an observer of oneself, the choice of the project with\nits historical determinants. Of course, Schutz, working within the\nparameters of Husserl\u2019s non-naturalistic account of\nconsciousness, would have conceived such determinants not so much as\nempirico-mechanical causes but rather as influences discoverable\nthrough an interpretive process, associating earlier events with the\nlater ones they seem to have influenced. Schutz\u2019s position comes\nclosest to the roughly compatibilist outlooks of P.F. Strawson and\nThomas Nagel, who distinguish between the participant and observer\nattitudes prior to theoretical discussions and who align the\nparticipant attitude with freedom and the observer attitude with\ndeterminism. Schutz, however, contributes the unique insight that\nthese attitudes take place within distinctive temporal frameworks,\noriented toward the future or the past.\n\nSchutz\u2019s account of the temporal framework of motivation\npermitted criticism of Weber\u2019s view that one could orient\none\u2019s action to the past behavior of others, since, while such\nbehavior might have served as the because motive of an action, one\ncould not aim at affecting another\u2019s already completed action.\nSimilarly, failure to appreciate temporality often leads to\nmisinterpretations of action, as when one assumes that the\noutcome of an act may have been its motive without considering the\nactor\u2019s in-order-to motive, which due to unforeseen events may\nhave been adjusted or may have led to results contrary to those\nintended. Likewise, one can interpret an economic action after the\nfact as less than rational without taking sufficient account of the\nlimited information that was available to the actor at the time of\ndeciding to act and that might make her action seem perfectly\nrational. Moreover, the fact that one\u2019s own temporal stream of\nconsciousness never completely coincides with that of another, whose\nsequence of events and intensity of experience inevitably differs from\none\u2019s own, places limits on one\u2019s understanding of\nanother. As a consequence, the objective meanings of language, defined\nin dictionaries as invariant regardless of users, also bear subjective\nconnotations for language users due to their unique histories of\nlinguistic experience, even though for practical purposes of\ncommunication they are able to set aside such differences. For\ninstance, one would have to consider in depth Goethe\u2019s works as\na whole to understand what he meant by \u201cdemonic.\u201d\nSchutz\u2019s basic point in all these examples involves getting\nbehind constituted meanings to the temporal processes by which actors\nbuild up the meaning of their own actions\u2014a meaningful build-up\naccentuated by the German title of his Phenomenology of the Social\nWorld (Der sinnhafte Aufbau der sozialen Welt).\n\nIn addition to this account of consciousness, motivation, and action,\nhe examined the structure of the social world, including Consociates\nwho share the same time and spatial access to each other\u2019s\nbodies, Contemporaries with whom one shares only the same time, and\nPredecessors and Successors with whom one does not share the same time\nand to whose lived bodies one lacks access. Consociates, present to\neach other physically, partake of each other\u2019s inner time, that\nis, the on-rolling life of the other, grasp the building up of the\nother\u2019s experience, and live in a We-relationship that entails\n\u201cgrowing older together.\u201d While Consociates revise their\ntypes of each other immediately, one must proceed more inferentially\nwith Contemporaries, Predecessors, and Successors, constructing ideal\ntypes based on letters or reports and running greater risks of\nmisunderstanding, depending on the degree of anonymity of the person\nto be understood. One could say, then, that Weber\u2019s method of\nideal type construction, illustrated in his sociological account of\nthe Protestant at the origins of capitalism, is not really that\nforeign to the everyday life-world in which actors beyond the\nConsociate level continually relate to each other via such type\nconstruction. Human actors in everyday life already adopt toward each\nother the attitudes of social scientists.\n\nSchutz conceived his work as developing a \u201cphenomenological\npsychology\u201d of \u201cinner experience\u201d and focusing on\nthe invariant features of the life-world toward which theoreticians,\nincluding social scientists, turn reflectively. Although J\u00fcrgen\nHabermas criticizes Schutz\u2019s account of the life-world for being\n\u201cabridged in a culturalistic fashion\u201d and not addressing\ninstitutional orders and personality structures (Habermas 1987,\n2:126\u2013132), it would seem that Schutz himself delimits his own\nwork in just this fashion. According to him, social scientists develop\nconstructs, ideal types, of the meaning-contexts of life-world actors,\nand they test these types to determine if they are causally adequate,\nthat is conforming to past experience, and meaning adequate, that is,\nconsistent with whatever else is known about the actor. Responding to\nMises\u2019s critique that Weber\u2019s ideal-types are too\nhistorically specific, Schutz suggested that the later Weber\u2019s\nideal types in Economy and Society attain a generality\ncomparable to that of Mises\u2019 own economic theory, which itself\ncould be interpreted as presenting ideal-typical descriptions of the\nbehavior of economic agents. The later Weber\u2019s types depict the\ninvariant subjective experiences of anyone who acts within the\neconomic framework as defined by the principle of marginal utility,\nthat is, choosing to maximize satisfaction.\n3. Extensions\n3.1 The Bergson Writings\n\nSchutz\u2019s manuscripts on Bergson, produced from 1925 to 1927 and\nfinally published in English in 1982, illuminate his subsequent works,\nwith which they share the general purpose of \u201cthe grounding of\nthe social sciences in the Thou experience.\u201d (Schutz 1982, 34)\nIn reaction to positivistic approaches of the Schlick Circle (in which\nFelix Kaufmann participated) that reduced experience to what the\nmethod of natural scientific observation found tolerable, Schutz\nsought to give an account of the life-form of pre-scientific\nexperience preceding conceptual-categorical comprehension, the\n\u201chighest and most powerful life-form\u201d (Schutz 1982, 53).\nOf course, by moving in this direction, he encountered the problem,\nfaced by Georg Wilhelm Friedrich Hegel, Wilfrid Sellars, John\nMcDowell, Robert Brandom, and others, namely, how it is possible to\naccess the pre-conceptual without conceptualizing it. Hence, he\nacknowledged that his work is \u201cin conflict with its\nmaterial\u201d since it \u201cis forced to resort to conceptual\nformulations\u201d (Schutz 1982, 70). This problem parallels the\nproblem of reaching the life-form of the present unfolding of\nexperience (duration) since one can only speak of it by arresting its\nflow, distinguishing its moments, and thus remembering what has\nlapsed\u2014but then one is in the new life-form of memory. Although\nthis gap between present duration and memory prompted his turn to\nHusserlian phenomenology, the problematic itself highlighted for him\nthe pervasiveness and hiddenness of interpretive activity as one moves\nbetween interpretive frameworks\u2014a principal theme of all his\nlater work. He took notice of this theme when he frequently pointed\nout how one\u2019s reconstitution of a past experience in memory\nvaried according to the interests of the present from which\none remembered the past. Indeed a favorite example from\nBergson\u2019s work involved an actor reflecting upon a prior process\nof choosing and interpreting it as if it had been a choice between two\nclearly defined possibilities, whereas in fact the process often\noscillated between several options, retaining, reproducing, comparing,\nand modifying them in succession. In general, Schutz concurred with\nBergson on such notions such as attention to life, planes of\nconsciousness, the body as the intersection of outer and inner\ntemporality, music as the model of duration, and multiple types of\nordering, but rejected his bio-evolutionary theory, vitalism, and the\nidea of a supra-personal el\u00e1n.\n3.2 The Social Sciences\n\nAlthough Schutz defended Weber against Mises, he agreed with many\nbasic premises of Mises and the Austrian tradition that focused on the\nsubjective preferences of the purchaser conferring value on objects\ninstead of explaining value as the result of objective processes such\nas production costs or labor time invested. He also shared\nMises\u2019s suppositions about value-freedom in economic science,\nthe need to describe rather than evaluate preferences, and the\ninstrumental task of science, namely, of showing how to achieve ends\nrather than assessing their value. Since Mises considered all acting\neconomic insofar as any consumer choice involved maximizing\nsatisfaction in the widest sense, he opposed the narrow type of the\nhomo economicus, modeled on the businessperson driven solely\nby economic motives at the expense of all others. Schutz, however,\nposited the life-world with its wide diversity of motivations at the\nbase of economic theory. He conceived such theory as adopting a\nreflective perspective governed by the principle of marginal utility,\nnamely, that ideal types ought to be constructed as if all\nactors \u201chad oriented their life-plans to realize the greatest\nutility with minimal cost.\u201d (Schutz 1964, 87) Besides thus\nresuscitating a version of homo economicus, Schutz insisted\nthat economists study purposive-rational actions, which, in\nWeber\u2019s sense, involved a reflective comparison of alternative\nprojects before adopting one as an in-order-to motive. In addition, he\nclassified the sense of uneasiness that Mises described as prompting\nthe search for satisfaction under the category of because motives; one\nfirst adopts an rationally determined economic project and in\nretrospect discovers the preceding dissatisfaction. To understand the\ndifference between conceiving all action as economic and conceiving\neconomic action as one type of action within an more encompassing\nlife-world, one might compare Mises with Schutz with reference to a\nproblem raised within contemporary discussions of collective action,\nnamely, how traditional non-economic values (e.g., those of politics\nor ethics) ought to intersect the market. Mises would countenance\neconomic agents registering their values economically, that is, by\ndeciding to purchase or not (e.g. as a protest against polluting\ncompanies), thereby converting all values into economic ones, whereas\nSchutz would call for a process negotiating the boundaries between\ndifferent life-world value domains.\n\nIn \u201cConcept and Theory Formation in the Social Sciences,\u201d\nSchutz addressed the broader issue of the relationship between\nphilosophy and the social sciences in general. In that essay, Schutz\nresponded to Ernest Nagel\u2019s positivistic view that the social\nsciences should make use of natural scientific methods, identifying\nevidence with sensory observable data and criticizing the Weberian\nmethod of \u201cunderstanding\u201d as appealing to uncontrollable\nand unverifiable introspection. Schutz agreed with Nagel on several\ncounts, namely that social scientists needed to validate theoretical\nbeliefs, that lack of predictability in the social sciences did not\ndisqualify their scientific character, and that Weber would have been\nwrong if his method of \u201csubjective interpretation\u201d implied\nempathy with unobservable, introspective states. The problem was,\nthough, that the natural scientific approach to the social sciences,\ninsofar as it separated verifiable observable behavior from\nunverifiable inner states (purposes, emotions), seemed to play on the\nmap drawn by Descartes who divorced body from mind and allowed only\nstatements about the former to be scientifically verifiable. Further,\nthe natural scientific approach depended on a basic presupposition\nsince without first examining the object of social\nscience\u2014social reality, in Schutz\u2019s terms\u2014one would\nbe simply presupposing that the methods of the natural sciences were\nappropriate to its study. Therefore, Schutz attempted first to clarify\nsocial reality, described in depth by his own phenomenology of the\nsocial world, and to indicate how actors sustain that reality by\nunderstanding each other\u2019s in-order-to motives in typical terms\n(e.g., going to school, making a purchase, marrying). Such mutual\nunderstanding takes place without either somehow or other penetrating\ninto the other\u2019s private, inner sanctum, or reducing the other\nto the status of animal organism responding to stimuli. Given this\naccount of social reality, in which actors give meaning to their\nworld, as opposed to physical reality whose objects (e.g., electrons,\nquarks) do not interpret their world, Schutz argued that the\nappropriate social scientific method involved developing constructs of\neveryday actor\u2019s constructs. Social scientific constructs, ideal\ntypes in Weber\u2019s sense, aimed at capturing the subjective\nmeaning of the actor, that is, according to Weber\u2019s intentions,\nthe meaning of the actor as opposed to the social scientist and not\nsome introspective inner process. Schutz conceived statistical and\nother formulations of social scientific laws as a legitimate kind of\nintellectual shorthand, always presupposing the meaningful activity of\nthe individual social actor, the \u201cforgotten man\u201d of the\nsocial sciences (Schutz 1964, 6\u20137). To ensure the kind of\nvalidation that Nagel sought, mistakenly though, by restricting\nhimself to sensory observable data, Schutz proposed that social\nscientists displace their everyday practical interests in favor of a\nguiding interest in accurate scientific description and observe\npostulates of logical consistency and adequacy to the experiences\ndescribed.\n\nIn order to elucidate the meaning of rational action, Schutz\nhypothesized what a rational actor would have to know, even though\nsuch completely rational actions might never be realized in everyday\nlife. Such an actor would have to know: an end\u2019s relationship\nwith other ends, the consequences and by-products of realizing an end,\nthe means suitable for the end, the interaction of such means with\nother ends and means, and the accessibility of those means. In\naddition, the rational actor would need to understand: her\ninteractors\u2019 understanding of all the previous factors, the\ninterpretation of her act by others, the reactions of other people and\ntheir motivation, and the useful categories she had already discovered\nin the social world. Although social scientists might use such models\nof completely rational action to assess the rationality of everyday\nactors, Schutz cautioned social scientists that if their task were to\ndescribe life-world actors, they also needed to be wary of replacing\nthe viewpoint of everyday actors with a fictional, non-existing world\nconstructed by scientific observers. In fact, a central point of\ndiscussion in the published correspondence between Schutz and Talcott\nParsons concerned the subjective viewpoint of the actor, whose\nsub-acts, for example, could not be adequately understood without\ncomprehending the actor\u2019s overarching project, whose temporal\nspan is at first accessible only to that actor. Finally, it should be\nnoted that Schutz himself produced two pieces of applied research in\nwhich he constructed ideal types of the Stranger and the Homecomer,\ntaking account of what their experiences meant to them instead of what\nsocial scientists or others might think they meant.\n3.3 Other Philosophies\n\nAlthough references to philosophers in the pragmatist tradition, such\nas John Dewey and George Herbert Mead are scattered through\nSchutz\u2019s writings, it was to William James that he devoted his\nfirst full-length essay after arriving in the United States. Briefly\nalluding to the methodological differences between Husserl and James,\nhe emphasized two points where the \u201cgreat masters\u201d\nconverged: the stream of thought and the theory of fringes. Both\nthinkers stressed that personal consciousness involves no multiplicity\nof elements needing to be reunited, but rather a unity from which one\nseparates out components, and they each examined the modifications\nthat reflection introduces into the lived stream, converting an\n\u201cI\u201d into a \u201cMe\u201d or uncovering the workings of\nintentionality. Further, Husserl\u2019s idea that the kernel of\nmeaning distinguishing an object stood out against the unthematized\nnetwork of relationships that makes up its horizon paralleled\nJames\u2019s belief that topics have their \u201cfringes.\u201d\nSuch fringes connect a topic with other experiences, such that, for\ninstance, one does not hear merely \u201cthunder,\u201d but\n\u201cthunder-breaking-in-upon-silence-and-contrasting-with-it.\u201d\nSimilarly, the Jamesian idea about grasping as a unity what must be\nlearned through a many-stepped processes, such as the Pythagorean\ntheorem, could be translated into the Husserlian terminology regarding\nthe monothetical grasping of polythetic processes. Likewise,\nJames\u2019s discussion of focusing on an object within a broader\ntopic resembled Husserl\u2019s view that one could discern a noema,\nthat is, a perspectival aspect through which a thing constituted of\nmany such aspects presented itself.\n\nAnother American philosopher to whom Schutz dedicated an entire essay\nwas George Santayana, whose Dominations and Powers he\nreviewed. While most of the essay was expository, Schutz praised\nSantayana\u2019s effort to base politics on a philosophical\nanthropology and his insights into the enslaving potential of\ntechnology. However, Schutz, no doubt convinced by Mises\u2019s\npositive assessment of economic activity, resisted Santayana\u2019s\nreduction of it to domination. Likewise, as a phenomenologist opposed\nto a Santayana\u2019s naturalistic founding of spirit on the physical\norder of nature, Schutz dissented from a conviction derived from this\nnaturalism, namely, that democracy could solve it problems only by\nreturning to the \u201cgenerative order\u201d of agriculture.\n\nBesides these interchanges with American philosophers, Schutz (later\nin his career) interpreted the work of Max Scheler and (earlier)\nengaged thoroughly his treatment of intersubjectivity, a topic that\nSchutz insisted was to be treated within the natural attitude, in\nwhich one never doubted the existence of others. Schutz agreed with\nScheler\u2019s belief that the \u201cWe\u201d is given prior to the\n\u201cI\u201d\u2014a position that the latter defended on the basis\nof the psychology of children and cultures less accustomed to\nself-reflection. Schutz supported this priority, however he did so on\nthe grounds that while living in one\u2019s acts in the natural\nattitude and living also in the other\u2019s present experience as it\nunfolds, one at first does not clearly distinguish one\u2019s own\nthoughts from others\u2019. Nevertheless, as soon as one reflects on\nhis own stream of consciousness\u2014and children and cultures may\ndevelop this capacity for self-reflection later\u2014he becomes aware\nthat his experiences are his own. Schutz found plausible\nScheler\u2019s belief in the inner (indubitable) perception of the\nother, if \u201cinner perception\u201d refers to anything connected\nwith mental life or if one locates the experience of living in the\nvivid simultaneity of the \u201cWe\u201d within his own conscious\nstream, as Schutz believed possible. However much in that vivid\nsimultaneity one might be unable to doubt the other\u2019s existence,\none could still be mistaken about specific thoughts of the others,\nsince by belonging to the other\u2019s stream of\nconsciousness these thoughts share the dubitability characterizing\nouter perceptions, likewise transcendent to one\u2019s stream of\nexperience.\n\nAnother figure, more or less within the phenomenological tradition,\nwhose views on intersubjectivity Schutz examined and criticized, was\nJean-Paul Sartre, particularly the Sartre of Being and\nNothingness. In \u201cSartre\u2019s Theory of the Alter\nEgo,\u201d Schutz elucidated Sartre\u2019s attempt to develop an\nextra-empirical, real communication with the other that avoids the\nextremes of an empiricist intersubjectivity beginning with the\nother\u2019s body and an idealist reduction of the other to a series\nof presentations. After explaining Sartre\u2019s differences\nregarding intersubjectivity with Husserl, Hegel, and Heidegger, Schutz\nlaid out Sartre\u2019s existential account of how the other is given\nas a subject through the Look and how one can in turn objectify the\nother by returning the gaze. Although Sartre had intended to describe\nhow one\u2019s body is given to the other, he instead portrayed how\nthe other\u2019s body is given to oneself, assuming that such\ndescriptions were reversible. Schutz, who did not believe that the\nproblem of intersubjectivity could be addressed adequately within the\ntranscendental sphere, applauded Sartre\u2019s rejection of\nHusserl\u2019s transcendental approach to intersubjectivity; however,\nSartre\u2019s emphasis on the other as a center of activity reflected\na continuing Husserlian influence. The main problem, though, with\nSartre\u2019s doctrine was that its starting point in a mutual\nlooking, by which each subject reduces the other to an object,\nprecluded any possibility of a relationship between the I-subject and\nother-subject. Further, Schutz wondered how Sartre would know that the\nother\u2019s body was given to him in the same way that his body was\nto the other if the other\u2019s subjectivity escaped his\n\u201cI.\u201d Moreover, Schutz acknowledged that the other\u2019s\ninterests might not coincide with his own, but he failed to see how\nthis fact entailed that either the other or he reduce each other to a\nutensil. Instead, he pointed to the \u201cmutual tuning-in\u201d to\nbe found in making music together and in language as proof that\nsubjects interact as \u201cco-performing subjectivities\u201d and\nthat mutual interaction in freedom better describes intersubjectivity\nthan Sartre\u2019s practical solipsism.\n3.4 Applications\n\nIn 1945, Schutz published an essay, \u201cOn Multiple\nRealities,\u201d that extended the theory of The Phenomenology of\nthe Social World and anticipated later essays applying that\ntheory. While he reiterated earlier views about levels of activity,\nBergsonian tensions of consciousness, and the structure of the social\nworld, his work took a decidedly pragmatic twist, emphasizing\n\u201cworking\u201d (Wirken) as involving bodily movements\nas opposed to the covert performances of mere thinking. In manuscripts\nin the 1930s and after The Phenomenology of the Social World,\nSchutz had already turned in this pragmatic direction. In \u201cOn\nMultiple Realities,\u201d he enlarged upon the \u201cworld of\nworking\u201d by demonstrating how reflection dissolves the self\nunified in lived action into partial, role-taking selves and by\nexpanding Mead\u2019s idea of the \u201cmanipulatory sphere\u201d\nto include worlds within \u201cpotential reach,\u201d either\nrestorable (from the past) or attainable (in the future). This\n\u201cworld of working\u201d constitutes the paramount reality,\norganized in its interests in the face of the fundamental anxiety that\nderives, as it did for Heidegger, from the inescapability of\none\u2019s own death. Following Husserl\u2019s views on how\nconsciousness can modify its stances toward reality and\nde-ontologizing James\u2019s sub-universes of reality, Schutz\ndeveloped the notion of various finite provinces of meaning. One\nenters any of these provinces, such as those of phantasms, dreams, the\ntheater, religious experience, or theoretical contemplation, by\nundergoing different types of epoch\u00e9, analogous to the\nphenomenological prototype, as when one slips into a daydream, falls\nasleep, watches theater curtains open, commences a ritual, or assumes\nthe scientist\u2019s role. Each province contains its distinctive\nlogical, temporal, corporal, and social dimensions, and movement\nbetween the provinces only becomes paradoxical (e.g., asking how\nphenomenologists are able to communicate their private findings\npublicly) if one conceives the provinces as ontological static realms\nto which one transmigrates as a soul to another world. Rather the\nprovinces are permeable, and one adopts the attitudes of scientist or\nreligious believer within the world of working as if it were\nseen through by another viewpoint, all the while that its\ncommunicative activities subtend these other provinces. There is\nsomething paradoxical, though, about describing one\u2019s dreams or\ntheorizing about religious experience since to give an account one\nmust absent oneself from the province for which one accounts, and\nKierkegaard\u2019s notion of indirect communication and various\npostmodern critiques of theory address themselves to just such\nparadoxes.\n\nThe essay on multiple realities underpins Schutz\u2019s theory of\nsigns and symbols in \u201cSymbol, Reality, and Society,\u201d\npublished almost ten years later. Synthesizing the notion of potential\nreach from the earlier essay with Husserl\u2019s concept of\nappresentation, namely that one element of a pair refers to\nanother not directly given in experience, Schutz describes how agents\novercome whatever transcends them. Hence they leave marks to\nbring within reach what they leave behind (e.g., breaking a twig to\nremind oneself to turn when one returns) or follow\nindications, that is, regular connections not of their making\n(e.g. smoke indicating a not yet visible fire), to bring within their\nknowledge what lies beyond it. Signs, however, appresent in\nan intersubjective setting the meanings of one person to another, but\nan insuperable transcendence still remains insofar as the each\none\u2019s stream of consciousness and therefore meanings are never\nidentical with another\u2019s. Finally, through symbols,\ndeveloped within groups, something given within everyday reality\nappresents a reality belonging to a entirely different province of\nmeaning, an ultimate transcendence (e.g., the stone where Jacob\ndreamed of a ladder to heaven memorializes God, accessible within the\nreligious province of meaning).\n\nSchutz dealt with this theme of language in other contexts, comparing\nHusserl\u2019s distinction between prepredicative (prepropositional)\nand predicative levels with Kurt Goldstein\u2019s separation, based\non studies of brain lesions, of a concrete attitude relying on\nautomatic speech associations from an abstract attitude forming\npropositions and utilizing rational language. Husserl\u2019s\nprepredicative/predicative differentiation plays a key role in\nSchutz\u2019s essay \u201cType and Eidos in Husserl\u2019s Late\nPhilosophy,\u201d in which he shows a gradual development from\nempirical types passively constituted within the prepredicative sphere\nto presumptive universals spontaneously formed in the predicative\nsphere. At the predicative level, scientific reflection further\ntransforms nonessential types (e.g., that whales are fish) into\nessential ones (whales are mammals), and philosophy seeks eidetic\nuniversals. At the end of this essay, Schutz speculates whether the\nHusserlian method of freely varying examples to determine the\nessential features that survive through such variations is not\nconstrained by both ontological structure (e.g., sounds are not\ncolors) and the socially shaped, natural-attitude experience of types.\nIn his essay \u201cTiresias, or our Knowledge of Future\nEvents,\u201d produced contemporaneously with the type essay, Schutz\nexplains how knowledge based on natural attitude types functions in\ncontrast to the mythical Tiresias\u2019 knowledge of the future,\nwhich is private and detached from his present or past experience.\nThese types, based on past experiences or socially transmitted, aim at\nfuture occurrences not in their uniqueness but with an emptiness that\nfuture events will fill in, such that only in retrospect, after an\nevent occurs, is one able to determine how much that event was\nexpected or unexpected. Finally, there are future events lying beyond\none\u2019s influence that one expects only to conform with past\nexperience and there are indeterminate projects that provide\ndirection\u2014not too tightly, though\u2014as one gives shape to\nwhat is within one\u2019s power.\n\nSchutz, himself a trained pianist and widely read musicologist,\nintegrated his phenomenology with his understanding of music. Music,\ndiffering from language in being non-representative, lends itself to\nphenomenological analysis in the meaning it carries beyond its mere\nphysical nature as sound waves and in its character as an ideal object\nthat must be constituted through its unfolding stages, i.e.,\npolythetically. Further music is bound to inner temporality, and its\nthemes, even though their note sequences are the same, vary according\nto context, require reflection for their recognition, and emerge\nthrough an interplay between musical elements and the listener\u2019s\nattention and interest. Schutz found music instructive in regard to\nsocial relationships insofar as, prior to any communication, parties\nto musical performances establish a non-linguistic, non-conceptual\n\u201cmutual tuning in relationship.\u201d This\n\u201ctuning-in,\u201d this sharing of another\u2019s flux of\nexperience in inner time already described in his\nPhenomenology, is very clearly exhibited whenever a listener\nto a musical performance participates in quasi-simultaneity in the\ncomposer\u2019s stream of consciousness or when co-performers orient\nthemselves to each other, the composer, and the audience. Hence,\nSchutz disagreed with Maurice Halbwachs who posited musical notation\nas the basis of social relationships between performers, when in fact\nit is merely a technical device accidental to their relationship. In\nanother essay, Schutz depicted Mozart as a social scientist,\npresenting a succession of situations that different characters\ninterpret, and Schutz showed how orchestral representations of\ncharacters and their moods in melody made possible a simultaneity of\nfluxes of inner time that the non-operatic, non musical dramatist\ncould only unfold successively. Without self-consciously\nphilosophizing, Mozart conveyed in music and better than most\nphilosophers in their own medium, how human beings meet each other as\na \u201cWe.\u201d\n\nFred Kersten discovers in Schutz\u2019s musical writings important\nphilosophical insights. For instance, music and inner time unfold\npolythetically and cannot be grasped monothetically; that is, one must\nlive through the unfolding of a symphony or inner experience, and any\nconceptual summary of their contents inevitably fails to do justice to\ntheir meaning. However, since all conceptualization consists in a\nmonothetical grasping of polythetic stages, Schutz is actually\nrealizing that certain dimensions of consciousness elude\nconceptualization and thus demarcating the limits of rationalization,\njust as he had pointed out how certain provinces of meaning (e.g.\ndreams) evade theoretic comprehension or duration eludes memory.\nAccording to Kersten, Schutz has seen clearly that the passive\nassociations of listening (e.g. recognizing the appearance of\nsymphonic theme) differ from those of sight (e.g., apprehending an\nobject like a house) and that listening does not identify numerically\ndistinct items but produces an illusion of identification.\nSchutz\u2019s conclusion that sameness in music involves not\nnumerical unity but recurrent likeness challenges the fundamental\nHusserlian thesis that the synthesis of passive identification is\nuniversal, at the basis of the constitution of the world.\n\nSchutz was also a master of literature, a careful student of the works\nof Goethe, and author of an article that analyzed Miguel de\nCervantes\u2019s Don Quixote through the prism of the theory\nof multiple realities. Cervantes repeatedly brings Quixote\u2019s\n\u201cworld of chivalry\u201d\u2014an order of reality with its\narguments for its own reality, its stock of knowledge, modes of social\nreinforcement, and views about space, time, and causality\u2014into\nconflict with the worlds of drama, common sense, and science. Although\nQuixote is capable of constructing a defense of his own chivalrous\nworld from within that world, the fact that this phantasied world\ncontains an enclave of dreams (at the cave of Montesinos) ends up\nundermining it by raising the possibility that it itself is but a\ndream. Quixote\u2019s withdrawal of the accent of reality from his\nprivate province of meaning reveals for Schutz the importance of the\nparamount reality of everyday life and the value of Sancho Panza who\n\u201cremains deeply rooted in the heritage of common sense.\u201d\n(Schutz 1964, 158)\n\nSchutz also brought his phenomenology to bear on political issues such\nas citizenship or racial equality. His essay \u201cThe Well-Informed\nCitizen,\u201d dealing not only with citizenship but also the\nsociology of knowledge under the rubric of the social distribution of\nknowledge, constructs ideal types of the expert, the man on the\nstreet, and the well-informed citizen (to whom it falls to determine\nwhich experts are competent). Schutz delineates various zones of\ninterests, or relevances, extending from those within reach to those\nabsolutely irrelevant, comments on the constant changeability of\nrelevance configurations, and differentiates between relevances\nintrinsic to a theme, which one chooses, and those imposed.\nParadoxically, as modernity\u2019s rationalization processes heighten\nanonymity, modern technology also brings everyone within reach, as the\nnuclear arms race demonstrates, and Schutz suggests as a solution that\ncitizens become broadly informed rather than succumb to the narrow\ndogmatism of the man on the street or the short-sighted specialization\nof experts. In becoming well-informed, one depends on knowledge\nsocially derived through the consultation of eyewitnesses, insiders,\nanalysts, and commentators, depending on their access to facts and\ngoverning relevances, much as Alvin Goldman\u2019s social\nepistemology involves appraising the \u2018veritistic\u2019 value of\nassorted agents\u2019 claims and practices. Schutz, usually the\nvalue-free describer of social reality, in his conclusion endorses a\nnormative notion of democracy in which it is a duty and a privilege,\nfrequently not available in non-democratic societies, for\nwell-informed citizens to express and defend opinions that often\nconflict with the uninformed opinions of the man in the street.\n\nSchutz composed \u201cEquality and the Meaning Structure of the\nSocial World\u201d at the time of the legal decision of Brown v.\nBoard of Education that ended racially segregated education in\nthe United States. With typical dispassion, Schutz explains how the\nmeaning of the term \u201cequality\u201d depends on the domain of\nrelevances to which it pertains (e.g., economic equality, equality of\ncivil rights, etc.) and on the in-group or out-group utilizing\nit\u2014and here he conceives interpretation in terms of groups\nrather than individuals. He spends most of the essay contrasting\nsubjective and objective interpretations of group membership,\nequality, and equality of opportunity, construing\n\u201csubjective\u201d and \u201cobjective\u201d in terms of\nin-group and out-group interpretations. As regards group membership,\nhe illustrates that the mere categorization of another as a member of\na group need not be discriminatory, but depends upon an appropriate\nevaluation of the category from the viewpoint of the categorized\nindividual. In-groups and out-groups differ in whether they understand\nequality merely as \u201cformal,\u201d i.e., as nondiscrimination,\nor \u201creal,\u201d calling for special rights and services.\nSimilarly groups think of equality of opportunity from an out-group\nperspective as \u201cthe career open to all\u201d without\nappreciating how in-group members might subjectively experience\ninsuperable obstacles in trying to avail themselves of opportunities\nsupposedly objectively equal. In this essay, Schutz is concerned not\nto present a final definition of equality, but to highlight the\ndifferences between in-group and out-group understandings that serve\nas the preconditions of any discussion about it.\n\nSome recently published texts that Schutz authored during an ethics\ninstitute in 1956 make possible an even richer awareness of his views\non politics. In these documents, he recognizes the complex, unforeseen\nconsequences resulting from social change, urges active engagement\nwith others as crucial for developing social and civil judgment, and\nexamines the barriers to sound civil judgment created by government,\npolitical parties, pressure organizations, mass media, and\neducational, familial, religious, and professional institutions. At\none point, he even criticizes views that limit democracy to mere\nmajoritarian rule insofar as they neglect the importance of the single\nindividual\u2019s ability \u201cto make his personal opinion be\nheard and appreciated,\u201d preferably in smaller publics, such as\nfamilies, schools, local communities (cited in L. Embree 1999, 271).\nOne could take Schutz\u2019s thoughts here to converge with political\ntheories favoring what is today known as deliberative democracy.\nMoreover, his normative judgment against implementations of democracy\nthat increase the anonymity of citizens suggests that a parallel\nnormative, even ethical, dimension informs his many theoretic\nendeavors to retrieve from anonymity the neglected subjective\nviewpoint of actors, whether strangers, homecomers, victims of\ndiscrimination, or the \u201cforgotten man\u201d of social\nsciences.\n3.5 Phenomenology\n\nSchutz\u2019s philosophical targeting of the social world had its\nrepercussions upon phenomenology, particularly in his critique near\nthe end of his career of Husserl\u2019s account (also referred to as\na \u201ctranscendental constitution\u201d) of how the other person\ncomes to appearance in consciousness. In \u201cThe Problem of\nTranscendental Intersubjectivity in Husserl,\u201d Schutz first\nobjected when Husserl in his Fifth Cartesian Mediation prepared the\nground for the other\u2019s appearance in consciousness by the\nmethodology of screening off everything that referred to other minds.\nHusserl had begun the Cartesian Meditations by reflectively\nabstaining from believing in the existence of what appeared in\nexperience in order to refrain from any dogmatic suppositions, but\nsince this first epoch\u00e9, or phenomenological\nreduction, still left meanings with intersubjective references, the\nscreening off methodology, or second epoch\u00e9, became\nnecessary. For Husserl, one\u2019s actual or potential experiences\nof correlates that were not properly of the ego still would\nbelong to one\u2019s sphere of ownness, but one had to seek to\nexclude any reference those correlates, as products of the\nsense-determining of other subjectivities, might have to those other\nsubjectivities. For Schutz, however, insofar as those experiences of\nwhat was not properly of the ego, supposedly confined within the\nsphere of ownness, had their origin in the intersubjective world of\neveryday life that higher level phenomenological reflection\npresupposed, it seemed difficult to see how one could exclude from\nsuch correlates any reference to the sense-determininng of other\nsubjectivities. It was as though Husserl was striving for a\ntheoretical detachment that the ontological origins of theory would\nnot allow. In addition, for Schutz the very consciousness of another\ninevitably instituted a relationship with her. Husserl\u2019s\nargument in the Fifth Meditation continued by affirming that a\nnon-ratiocinative \u201cpairing\u201d occurred through which one\ntransferred the sense \u201canother living body\u201d to another.\nOne could then verify that the other\u2019s living body was like\none\u2019s own if it continued manifesting behavior congruent with\nwhat one would expect of a living body. Schutz challenged this\nsense-transfer, however, since one experienced the other\u2019s body\nfrom the outside, unlike one\u2019s own, which was given interiorly\n(but might the similarities suffice for the transfer?), and he\nsuggested that verification through what was \u201ccongruent\u201d\nbehavior drew on social-world presuppositions of how bodies ought to\nbehave. Finally, he questioned whether the philosopher, refraining\nfrom belief in the existence of the world or others and entering into\na certain reflective solitude, could ever experience the\ntranscendental community of which Husserl spoke, since she only\nconstituted the world for herself and not for all other transcendental\negos. Intersubjectivity, Schutz concluded, was a matter of everyday\nlife to be simply described and not to be constituted within the\ntranscendental sphere of a self-reflective consciousness giving an\naccount of how the other comes to appearance. Just as Schutz had\nargued that the social world dictated the methods for its own social\nscientific investigation, so here it seemed to prescribe to\nphenomenology the approach appropriate to its description.\n\nIn the last thirteen years of his life, Schutz was preparing a\ncomprehensive phenomenology of the natural attitude, and one\nmanuscript, edited by Richard Zaner, was posthumously published as\nReflections on the Problem of Relevance, and another,\nco-authored by Thomas Luckmann, appeared as The Structures of the\nLife World. The former book distinguishes different sets of\ninterests, or relevances: topical (which focus attention on themes),\ninterpretive (which confer meanings on experiences or objects), and\nmotivational. Such relevances often involve a subject, with more or\nless systematic interests, or relevances, interacting with the world,\nand from this interaction between subject and world, it becomes\nevident what is \u201cof relevance\u201d to an actor. These\nrelevances, interdependent on each other and conjoined with\none\u2019s system of types or categories, constitute a stock of\nknowledge, which Schutz examines in terms of its genesis and\nstructure. He further explores the meaning of one\u2019s biographical\nsituation, including types and relevances, one\u2019s body, and the\nontological constraints of space and time that, for instance, prevent\none from being at certain places at certain times or compel one to\nwait (for salt to dissolve in water).\n\nThe Structures of the Life-World represents a most complex\nand thorough restatement of many of the themes Schutz addressed\nthroughout his life. After a more general account of the life-world\nand its relation to the sciences, the book takes up its various\nstratifications, such as provinces of meaning, temporal and spatial\nzones of reach, and social structure. Schutz and Luckmann then comment\non the components of one\u2019s stock of knowledge, including learned\nand non-learned elements, relevances and types, and trace the build-up\nof such a stock. The authors study the social conditioning of\none\u2019s subjective stock of knowledge and inquire about the social\nstock of knowledge of a group and different possible combinations of\nknowledge distribution (generalized and specialized). They consider\nhow subjective knowledge becomes embodied in a social stock of\nknowledge and how the latter influences the former. In addition, the\nauthors pursue such issues as the structures of consciousness and\naction, the choosing of projects, rational action, and forms of social\naction, whether such action be unilateral or reciprocal, immediate or\nmediate. A final section analyzes the boundaries of experience,\ndifferent degrees of transcendencies (from simply bringing an object\nwithin reach to the experience of death), and the mechanisms for\ncrossing boundaries (e.g. symbols).\n4. The Schutzian Tradition\n\nIn the years after Schutz\u2019s death in 1959, his works have been\nposthumously published and his thought expanded in several directions.\nPeter Berger and Thomas Luckmann wrote The Social Construction of\nReality, which focused on how subjective human processes\nconstruct objective structures that human subjectivity in turn\ninterprets and reacts to and which was among the most widely read\nbooks of social science in the twentieth century. Ilja Srubar\nemphasized the importance of the pragmatic dimensions of\nSchutz\u2019s corpus, just as Hans-Georg Soeffner, along with Jochen\nDreher, has developed its symbolic aspects. On Schutzian grounds,\nLester Embree produced a theory of science in the model of a\nWissenschaftslehre, and George Psathas extended\nSchutz\u2019s thought in the direction of ethnomethodology and\nconversation analysis. Recently, sociologists Hubert Knoblauch and\nCarlos Belvedere have shown the relevance of Schutz\u2019s framework\nto communication theory and questions of social ontology,\nrespectively. The Austrian Economic School has continued to make use\nof Schutz\u2019s works, as Daniela Griselda L\u00f3pez has shown.\nL\u00f3pez and Dreher have further argued that Schutzian theory can\nadequately account for the exercise of institutional power through the\ninterplay between objective structures and subjective\nmeaning-interpretation and the idea of relevances that are imposed\nupon agents. Michael Staudigl and George Berguno have edited a\ncollection of essays on the connection between the Schutzian approach\nand various hermeneutic traditions. And Staudigl and Michael Barber\nhave highlighted the connections between Schutz\u2019s philosophy of\nmultiple realities and religion and humor. Furthermore, collections of\nessays have addressed the value of Schutz\u2019s paradigm for music,\nliterature, and the arts. The work of Alfred Schutz opens a wide field\nthat is fruitful for addressing multiple themes and underpinning and\nsupporting multiple disciplines.\n\nIn 2016, the scholarly community in the Schutzian tradition\ncommemorated both the passing of Thomas Luckmann, one of\nSchutz\u2019s renowned students who developed his thought in diverse\nways, and the fiftieth anniversary of the publication of The\nSocial Construction of Reality. These commemorations took place\nthrough the editing of three major collections: Social\nConstructivism as Paradigm?, Lebenswelttheorie und\nGesellschaftsanalyse, and Mathesis Universalis. While\nthese works focus on Luckmann\u2019s work, including The\nStructures of the Life-World that Luckmann co-authored with\nSchutz, several of the essays address aspects of Schutz\u2019s\nthought: the objective dimensions of societal institutions in contrast\nto interpretations of such institutions as subjectivistic and devoid\nof power-relationships (Eberle 2019, Knoblauch 2019, Miji\u0107 2018,\nSrubar 2019); the possibility of a communicative construction of\nreality (Knoblauch 2019); the Schutzian paradigm\u2019s preservation\nof agents\u2019 potential to resist societal control in contrast to\nBourdieu\u2019s account of habitus (Dreher 2019); the role\nof the body in We-relationships (Meyer 2018); the capacity of the\nSchutzian framework to account for resilience in the face of trauma\n(Endress 2021); inequality as imposed relevance (L\u00f3pez 2021);\nspace and bodiliness as pertinent to the life-world as protosociology\n(Miji\u0107 2018, D\u00f6rfler & Rothfuss 2021, Steets 2021);\ndegrees of freedom within Schutz\u2019s relevance theory\n(G\u00f6ttlich 2021); linkages between Schutz\u2019s phenomenology\nand recent representatives of the Frankfurt School, such as Hartmut\nRosa (Gros 2021, Wannenmacher 2021); and the role of the life-world as\na mathesis universalis, that is, the ground-structure of all\nhuman experience that makes possible any comparison between cultures\nwithout reliance on the specific features of any one culture (Dreher\n2021, Meyer 2021, Sebald 2009).\n", "bibliography": {"categories": ["<a name=\"WorSch\">Works by Schutz</a>", "<a name=\"SecLit\">Secondary Literature</a>"], "cat_ref_text": {"<a name=\"WorSch\">Works by Schutz</a>": ["</h3>\n<ul class=\"hanging\">", "1932, <em>Der sinnhafte Aufbau der sozialen Welt: Eine Einleitung\nin die verstehenden Soziologie</em>, Vienna: Springer (also in 1960)\nand Frankfurt: Suhrkamp, 1974; English translation: <em>The\nPhenomenology of the Social World</em>, G.
