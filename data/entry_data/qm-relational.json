    "preamble": "\n\nRelational Quantum Mechanics (RQM) is the most recent among the\ninterpretations of quantum mechanics which are most discussed today.\nIt was introduced in 1996, with quantum gravity as a remote motivation\n(Rovelli 1996); interests in it has slowly but steadily grown only in\nthe last decades. RQM is essentially a refinement of the textbook\n\u201cCopenhagen\u201d interpretation, where the role of the\nCopenhagen observer is not limited to the classical world, but can\ninstead be assumed by any physical system. RQM rejects an ontic\nconstrual of the wave function (more in general, of the quantum\nstate): the wave function or the quantum state play only an auxiliary\nrole, akin to the Hamilton-Jacobi function of classical mechanics.\nThis does not imply the rejection of an ontological commitment: RQM is\nbased on an ontology given by physical systems described by physical\nvariables, as in classical mechanics. The difference with classical\nmechanics is that (a) variables take value only at\ninteractions and (b) the values they take are only\nrelative to the (other) system affected by the interaction.\nHere \u201crelative\u201d is in the same sense in which velocity is\na property of a system relative to another system in\nclassical mechanics. The world is therefore described by RQM as an\nevolving network of sparse relative events, described by\npunctual relative values of physical variables.\n\nThe physical assumption at the basis of RQM is the following\npostulate: The probability distribution for (future) values of\nvariables relative to \\(S'\\) depend on (past) values of variables\nrelative to \\(S'\\) but not on (past) values of variables relative to\nanother system \\(S''.\\)\n\nThe interpretation does not require to assume the existence of a\nclassical world to be formulated, nor special observer systems; it\ndoes not give any special role to measurement. Instead, it assumes\nthat any physical system can play the role of the Copenhagen\u2019s\nobserver and any interaction counts as a measurement. This is possible\nwithout changing the predictions of quantum theory thanks to the\npostulate above, because the interference observed by a system \\(S'\\)\nis not erased by the actualisation of variables relative to a\ndifferent system \\(S''\\) (it can of course be suppressed by\ndecoherence). In this way, RQM can make sense of a fully quantum world\nwithout requiring hidden variables, many worlds, physical collapse\nmechanisms, or a special role for mind, consciousness, subjectivity,\nagents, or similar.\n\nThe price to pay for this parsimony is a weakening of the conventional\n(\u201cstrong\u201d) realism of classical mechanics where physical\nvariables are assumed to have values which are non-relational and\nexist at every time. The fact that variables take value only at\ninteractions gives a sparse event (or \u201cflash\u201d) ontology;\nthe fact that they are labeled by the system to which they refer, adds\na level of indexicality to the representation of the world.\n\nRQM is metaphysically neutral, but it has a strong relational stance\nthat questions strong realism (Laudisa 2019), in a sense detailed\nbelow. Because of this tingling with realism, RQM has been framed, in\nturn, in the context of various philosophical perspectives, including\nconstructive empiricism (van Fraassen 2010), neo-Kantism (Bitbol 2007\n [Other Internet Resources/OIR],\n Bitbol 2010), more recently anti-monism (Dorato 2016) and structural\nrealism (Candiotto 2017). (See also Brown 2009, Wood 2010\n [OIR].)\n The interpretation has aspects in common with QBism (Fuchs 2001, 2002\n [OIR]),\n with Healey\u2019s pragmatist approach (Healey 1989) and especially\nwith the view of quantum theory discussed by Zeilinger and Bruckner\n(Zeilinger 1999, Brukner & Zeilinger 2003).\n",

    "main_text": "\n1. Main Ideas\n1.1 Values of physical variables\n\nThe starting point of RQM is that quantum mechanics is not about a\nwave function (or a quantum state) \\(\\psi\\); it is about values of\nphysical variables. The ontology assumed by RQM, accordingly, includes\nonly physical systems and variables that take values, as in classical\nmechanics. For instance, a real fact is the position of a particle\nhaving a certain value \\(x\\) at a certain time \\(t\\). Facts as this\none (\u201cthe particle is at \\(x\\) at time \\(t\\)\u201d) are called\n\u201cevents\u201d, or \u201cquantum events\u201d. Quantum theory\nis about events. However, in classical mechanics there are two general\nassumptions that are abandoned in quantum theory.\n\n(a) In classical mechanics it is assumed that all variables of a\nsystem have always a value at every time. RQM, on the contrary,\nassumes that this is in not the case in nature in general (Heisenberg\n1925; Kochen & Specker 1967). Rather, this is only an\napproximation that holds when disregarding quantum phenomena. Physical\nvariables acquire values only at some times, and have no value at the\nother times. Events, in other words, are discrete. This is the basic\nintuition that led Heisenberg to find the key to quantum mechanics in\n1925; that is, there are questions that make sense in classical\nmechanics, but have no significance in nature. For instance, the\nquestion \u201cWhat is the \\(y\\)-component of the spin of an electron\nwhen its \\(z\\)-component is \\(\\frac{1}{2} \\hslash\\)?\u201d is\nmeaningless: neither it admits an operational definition, nor is it\nneeded for a realistic understanding of nature (see below, about\nrealism). When does then a generic variable \\(A\\) of a system \\(S\\)\nacquire a value? When does an event happen? The RQM answer is: when\nand only when the system \\(S\\) interacts with a second system \\(S'\\)\nand the effect of the interaction on \\(S'\\) depends on the variable\n\\(A\\). In RQM, this is what it means for a variable to have a\nvalue.\n\n(b) The second assumption of classical mechanics which is dropped in\nRQM is that there are variables that take absolute values, namely\nvalues independent from any other systems. Instead, RQM assumes that\nall (contingent) physical variables are relational. (The\ncontingent variables are those with in classical theory are\nrepresented by phase space functions.) Any value these variables take\nis always (implicitly or explicitly) labelled by a second physical\nsystem. If the variable \\(A\\) of a system \\(S\\) takes a value in the\ninteraction with a second systems \\(S'\\), the value it takes is only\nrelative to \\(S'\\). The actualisation of an event is always\nrelative to a system. The concrete meaning of this is the postulate\nabove, according to which future ways the system \\(S\\) affects \\(S'\\)\ndepend (probabilistically) on the values that variables of \\(S\\) have\ntaken with respect to \\(S'\\), but future ways the system \\(S\\)\naffect a third system \\(S''\\) do not. The ensemble of all events\nrelative to an arbitrary system \\(S'\\), together with the\nprobabilistic predictions these entail, is called the\n\u201cperspective\u201d of the \u201cobserver\u201d \\(S'\\).\n\nThe central claim at the basis of RQM is therefore that:\n\u201cdifferent observers can give different accounts of the same set\nof events\u201d (Rovelli 1996: 1643). Textbook quantum mechanics is a\ncomplete description of the perspective of a single observer, but it\ndisregards the effect of this observer system on the perspective of\nother systems. RQM emphasises the fact that the observer itself\nbehaves as a quantum system, when acting on other systems. The\nrelation between perspectives is discussed below.\n1.2 Relative variables: \u201cDifferent observers can give different accounts of the same set of events\u201d\n\nRelative variables are variables whose value does not depend on a\nsingle system, but rather on two systems. A well known example is the\nvelocity of an object in classical mechanics. The velocity is always\nimplicitly or explicitly relative to a second object. There is no\n\u201cvelocity of a single object\u201d, irrespectively on any other\nobject, in classical mechanics. Other well-known examples are the\nelectric potential (only the potential of a conductor with respect to\nanother conductor has physical meaning) and position (only position\nwith respect to some other object has physical meaning). Relational\nquantum mechanics takes a further long step in this direction,\nassuming that we can make sense of quantum mechanics by assuming that\nall physical variables are relational in this sense.\n\nRQM is sometimes wrongly assumed to be an interpretation where\nsubjects, or agents, play a role. The source of the misunderstanding\nis the confusion between relative and subjective. When we say that the\nour speed is 11km/second with respect to the sun, we are not assuming\nthat the sun has subjectivity. When we say that the distance between a\nsignpost and a road intersection is 100 meters, we are not thinking\nthat a road\u2019s intersection is an agent. In a naturalistic\nperspective, a person, an agent, a subject, are physical systems. On\nthe other hand, the world this person, agent, or subject, relates to\nis described by the value of the variables with respect to\nthe physical system she is. This is like saying that a subject\ndwelling on the Earth sees the Cosmos rotating because the Earth is\nspinning. To say that RQM requires subjects or agents is the same\nmistake as saying that our explanation of the daily rotation of sun\nmoon and stars around the Earth requires to take agency or\nsubjectivity into account: an obvious nonsense. There is nothing\nsubjective, idealistic, or mentalistic, in RQM.\n1.3 Observer and measurement\n\nIn textbook presentations, quantum mechanics is about measurement\noutcomes performed when an \u201cobserver\u201d makes a\n\u201cmeasurement\u201d on a quantum system. What is an observer, if\nall physical systems are quantum? What counts as a measurement? Common\nanswers invoke the observer being macroscopic, onset of decoherence,\nirreversibility, registration of information, or similar. RQM does not\nutilise anything of the sort. Any system, irrespectively of its size,\ncomplexity or else, can play the role of the textbook\u2019s quantum\nmechanical observer. The \u201cmeasurement outcomes\u201d of a given\nobserver, however, refer only to values of the variables of the\nquantum system relative to that system. In particular, they do not\naffect events relative to other systems. In the same spirit, textbook\npresentations of quantum mechanics refer to \u201cmeasurement\noutcomes\u201d. In the relational interpretation, any interaction\ncounts as a measurement, to the extent one system affects the other\nand this influence depends on a variable of the first system. Every\nphysical object can be taken as defining a perspective, to which all\nvalues of physical quantities can be referred.\n\nAccording to RQM, therefore, quantum mechanics is not a theory of the\ndynamics of an entity \\(\\psi\\), from which the world of our experience\nsomehow emerges. It is instead a theory about the standard world of\nour experience, described by values that conventional physical\nvariables take at interactions, and about the transition probabilities\nthat determine which values are likely to be realized, given that\nothers were.\n1.4 The wave function\n\nThe wave function, and more in general the quantum state \\(\\psi\\), are\ninterpreted realistically in several presentations of quantum theory.\nFrom the perspective of RQM, this is precisely what generates the\nconfusion about quantum theory (Rovelli 2018). RQM circumvents the\ntheorems for the reality of the wave function (Leifer 2014; Pusey,\nBarrett, & Rudolph 2012) because it is not a strongly realist\ntheory\u2014in the sense defined below\u2014which is an implicit\nassumption of these theorems. The interpretation of the wave function\nin the context of RQM is akin the interpretation of the\nHamilton-Jacobi functional in classical mechanics: a theoretical tool\nto facilitate the computation of the probabilities of future events on\nthe basis of certain given knowledge.\n\nThe relation between the wave function \\(\\psi\\) and the\nHamilton-Jacobi functional \\(S\\) is more than an analogy, because in\nthe semiclassical approximation the later approximates the first\n\\((\\psi \\sim \\exp iS/\\hslash)\\). This fact can be taken as an argument\nagainst a realistic interpretation of \\(\\psi\\) for the following\nreason. A way to clarify the interpretation of a quantity in the\nmathematical apparatus of a physical theory is to study what this\nquantity reduces to in an approximation where the interpretation is\nclear. The Hamilton-Jacobi functions of, say, a classical particle has\nno realistic interpretation. Notice that if we gave it a realistic\ninterpretation, we would generate mysterious collapses and jumps as we\nhave for the wave function. Voiding the quantum states of a realistic\ninterpretation avoids jumps and collapses. (Another argument against\nthe realistic interpretation of \\(\\psi\\) is given in Rovelli\n2016.)\n\nIn classical mechanics we can dispense of the Hamilton-Jacobi\nfunctional. This testifies for its lack of ontological weight. We can\nequally dispense with \\(\\psi\\) in quantum theory. Evidence of this is\nthat the full early development of the quantum mechanical formalisms\n(Heisenberg 1925; Born & Jordan 1925; Dirac 1925; Born,\nHeisenberg, & Jordan 1926) predates the work where \\(\\psi\\) was\nintroduced (Schroedinger 1926)! Quantum mechanics can be formulated\nwithout reference to the quantum state, as a theory of probabilities\nfor sequences of events. For instance, quantum theory can be\nformulated by giving the non-commutative algebra of observables and a\none-parameter group of automorphisms of the algebra representing time\nevolution, and a single positive linear function on the algebra.\nEquivalently, it can be formulated in terms of transition\nprobabilities between ensembles of values of variables; these can be\ndirectly computed, for instance with path integral methods. The state\n\\(\\psi\\) is a convenient, not a necessary tool.\n\nWhat is then the quantum state in the relational interpretation? It is\na mathematical device that refers to two systems, not a single one. It\ncodes the values of the variables of the first that have been\nactualised in interacting with the second (Groenewold 1957); it\ntherefore codes anything we can predict regarding the future values of\nthese variables, relative to the second system. The state \\(\\psi\\) ,\nin other words, can be interpreted as nothing more than a compendium\nof information assumed, known, or gathered through measurements,\ndetermined entirely by a specific history of interactions: the\ninteractions between the system and a second \u2018observing\u2019\nsystem. Understood in this manner the quantum state is always and only\na relative state in the sense of Everett (1957). In this\nsense RQM is \u201cEverettian\u201d; it is so in a different sense\nthan the Many Worlds interpretations, which are based on a realistic\ninterpretation of the universal wave function, rejected in RQM.\n1.5. Quantum superposition: can a cat be half dead, half alive?\n\nIf \\(\\psi'\\) and \\(\\psi''\\) are two (orthogonal) quantum states of a\nsystem, quantum mechanics predicts that the system can also be in the\nstate \\(\\psi = (\\psi' +\\psi'')/\\sqrt{2}\\) . This is the superposition\nprinciple, a cornerstone of the theory. For instance, if \\(\\psi'\\) is\nthe state of a live cat and \\(\\psi''\\) the state of a dead cat, then\n\\(\\psi\\) is a state which the cat is in a quantum superposition of\ndead and alive; the theory predicts that this is a possible state of a\ncat. Why then don\u2019t we ever see cats that are half alive and\nhalf dead? That is: why don\u2019t we see macroscopic objects in\nquantum superpositions?\n\nThe answer is that the existence of states like \\(\\psi =(\\psi'\n+\\psi'')/\\sqrt{2}\\) does not mean that we should \u201csee\nsuperpositions\u201d: what we \u201csee\u201d, namely what we\nmeasure, according to textbook quantum theory, are eigenvalues of\nself-adjoint operators, not quantum states. Measured eigenvalues are\nalways univocal, never \u201csuperimposed\u201d.\n\nWhat does it mean then for a state to be a superposition? First, it\nmeans that if an observable has value \\(a'\\) in \\(\\psi'\\) and value\n\\(a''\\) in \\(\\psi''\\) then any observation of the system will give\neither \\(a'\\) or \\(a''\\), each with probability 1/2. Second, the\nprobability distribution of the outcomes of the measurement of any\nobservable that is not diagonal in the \\((\\psi'\\), \\(\\psi''\\)) basis\nwill be affected by interference: that is, it will not be the mean of\nthe average values of the observable in \\(\\psi'\\) and \\(\\psi''\\). This\nand nothing else is the meaning of being in a quantum superposition.\nHence, the answer to the question \u201cWhy don\u2019t we ever see\ncats that are half alive and half dead?\u201d is: because quantum\ntheory predicts that we never see this sort of things. It predicts\nthat we see cats either alive or dead. It also predicts that in\nprinciple we should be able to predict interference effect between the\ntwo states. These interference effects are strongly suppressed by\ndecoherence in the case of macroscopic systems (like cats), hence the\ntheory actually predicts that they are extremely hard to observe, in\nagreement with our experience.\n\nA problem, however, appears in quantum mechanics if we ask what the\ncat itself would perceive. Say the brain of the cat measures whether\nits heart is beating or not. The theory predicts that the brain will\nfind either that it does or that it does not. In textbook quantum\nmechanics, this implies a collapse of \\(\\psi\\) to either \\(\\psi'\\) or\n\\(\\psi''\\). In turns, this implies that no further effects of\ninterference between these two states will happen. And this\ncontradicts the conclusion that interference effects, although small\ndue to decoherence, are nevertheless real. This problem is\nresolved by RQM by the postulate above: the way the cat, as a quantum\nsystem, affects an external system, is not affected by the specific\nway the heart of the cat has affected its brain. That is, the state of\nthe cat with respect to the external world does not collapse when a\npart of the cat interact with another.\n2. Related Issues\n2.1 Information\n\nThe early presentations of RQM were formulated in the language of\ninformation theory (Rovelli 1996). The quantum state is a way of\ncoding the information that an observing system \\(S'\\) may have about\na quantum system \\(S\\), relevant for predicting future ways \\(S\\) can\naffect \\(S'\\). This information is determined by the ways \\(S\\) has\naffected \\(S'\\) in the past. The hope was raised in Rovelli (1996)\nthat a full reconstruction of the quantum formalism on the basis of\nsimple informational postulates was possible. Two main postulates were\nproposed:\n\n(i) relevant\ninformation is finite for a system with compact phase space,\n\n(ii) new information\ncan always be acquired. \n\n\nThe two postulates are not in contradiction with each other because\nwhen new information is gathered some previous relevant information\nbecomes irrelevant. \u201cRelevant\u201d here means that it affects\nfuture probabilities. A moment of reflection shows that first\npostulate implies the characteristic discreteness of quantum theory,\nthe second implies Heisenberg\u2019s uncertainties. Very similar\npostulates were independently proposed by Zeilinger and Bruckner\n(Zeilinger 1999; Brukner & Zeilinger 2003).\n\nAs later emphasized in Dorato (2017), information is best not\nunderstood as a primary notion. It must be defined physically in terms\nof something else; as such, it can play an important notion in\n\u201ctheories of principle\u201d in the sense of Einstein (1919).\nIn RQM, the information is defined relationally as relative\ninformation (in the sense of Shannon) that a physical system has about\nanother system. Relative information is physical correlation between\ntwo systems (see Rovelli 1996), namely a measure of the difference\nbetween the possible number of states of the combined system and the\nproduct of the number of states of the two systems, due to the\nexistence of physical constraints. Thus, we say that a variable\n\\(O_A\\) of a system has information about a variable \\(A\\) of another\nsystem if the values that \\(A\\) and \\(O_A\\) can take are correlated.\nIn the spirit of Shannon, this is a very weak definition of\ninformation that has no mentalistic, semantic, or cognitive aspects.\nThe strong informational perspective of the early work in RQM has\ninfluenced several later development of information theoretical\napproaches to the foundations of quantum theory (see below).\n2.2 Discreteness\n\nDiscreteness is not an accessory aspect of quantum theory: it is its\nmost characteristic feature (and it gives the theory its name).\n\nDiscreteness appears in two related ways in quantum theory. First, the\namount of information that can be gathered regarding the state of a\nsystem which is in a finite region R of its phase space is finite. It\nis given by the Liouville measure of R divided by the Planck constant,\nper degree of freedom. This is what causes discrete spectra.\nContinuous spectra require infinite phase spaces, and can be seen as\neffects of idealisations. The discreteness of quantum mechanics is\ncaptured by the first of the two informational postulates.\n\nSecond, quantum mechanics describes the world in terms of values of\nvariables at specific discrete times. This second aspect of\ndiscreteness is directly accounted for by the sparse (or\n\u201cflash\u201d) ontology of RQM. The history of a quantum\nparticle, for instance, is neither a continuous line is spacetime (as\nin classical mechanics), nor a continuous wave function on spacetime.\nRather, with respect to any other system it is a discrete set of\ninteractions, each localized in spacetime.\n\nThe flash ontology of RQM seems to raise a difficulty: what determines\nthe timing for the events to happen? The problem is the\ndifficulty of establishing a specific moment when, say, a measurement\nhappens. The question is addressed in Rovelli (1998), observing that\nquantum mechanics itself does give a (probabilistic) prediction on\nwhen a measurement happens. This is because the meaning of the\nquestion whether or not a measurement has happened is to ascertain\nwhether of not a pointer variable \\(O_A\\) in the observing system\n\\(S\\) has become properly correlated with the measured variable \\(A\\)\nof the system \\(A\\). In turn, this is a physical question that makes\nsense because it can be posed empirically by measuring \\(A\\) and\n\\(O_A\\) and checking if they are consistent.\n2.3 Comparison with other interpretations\n\nA way to clarify an interpretation of quantum mechanic is to compare\nit with the most discussed alternatives.\n\nTextbook Copenhagen: To a good extent RQM is a completion of\nthe standard textbook interpretation. The difference is that the\nlatter assumes the existence of a classical world, or a classical\nobserver, and describes the way quantum systems affect it in an\ninteraction. The relational interpretation, on the contrary, assumes\nthat this description is valid with respect to any physical system.\nThus, RQM is a sort of \u201cdemocratised\u201d Copenhagen, where\nthe role of the single observer can be assumed by any physical\nsystem.\n\nMany Worlds: Both RQM and the Many Worlds interpretation (see\nVaidman 2002 [2018]) are rooted in the work of Everett (1957). Both\nattempt to solve the mystery of quantum theory by adding a level of\nindexicality. In RQM, variables have values with respect to other\nphysical systems. In Many Worlds, variables have values with respect\nto branches of the universal wave function. In neither interpretations\nthere is an a priori special role for measurement, or observers. The\ndifference is the profoundly distinct ontological commitment: the Many\nWorlds interpretation is based on a realist interpretation of the\nuniversal wave function, which obeys a deterministic evolution law.\nThis implies that the Many Worlds interpretation must then work hard\nto recover Heisenberg uncertainty (via branch indexicality),\nprobabilities (via subjective interpretation of probability), and\ndiscreteness. RQM has all this easily in its foundation. On the other\nhand, the Many Worlds interpretation is based on a (according to some,\ninflated, but) no-nonsense realist metaphysics, which is precluded to\nRQM. The two can perhaps made closer by the simple observation that\nmodality can always be transformed into multiple world realism\n\u00e0 la Lewis (1986), trading actuality for\nindexicality.\n\nHidden variables (Bohm): Hidden variable theories, of which\nBohm theory (Bohm 1952) is the best available example, provide a\nrealistic and deterministic interpretation of quantum mechanics. The\nsimilarity between RQM and Bohm theory is in the realistic\ninterpretation of some variables, such as the position of a particle.\nA difference is in the sparse ontology of RQM, compared to the\nassumption of quantities unobservable in principle which is implicit\nin Bohm theory.\n\nPhysical collapse: Physical collapse theories like Ghirardi,\nRimini, and Weber (1986) and Penrose (1996) are physically\ndistinguishable from standard QM, which is instead assumed correct up\nto contrary empirical indications in RQM.\n\nThere are also current interpretation of quantum mechanics that are\nclose to the relational interpretation:\n\nZeilinger Bruckner: The Relational Interpretation is very\nclose to the view of quantum theory held developed by Zeilinger and\nBruckner; in particular, almost identical postulates to the original\nones of RQM were independently proposed in (Zeilinger 1999, Brukner\n& Zeilinger 2003). These ideas generated some of the interesting\nmathematical work aiming at making the derivation of the formalism of\nquantum theory from information theoretical postulates precise. For\nversions of this program strictly related to RQM see (Grinbaum 2005;\nH\u00f6hn 2017; H\u00f6hn & Wever 2017).\n\nQBism: The emphasis on information in Rovelli (1996)\ninfluenced the birth of QBism (see Fuchs 1998: 3). There are\nsimilarities between RQM and QBism (Fuchs 2001, 2002\n [OIR]).\n One similarity is the emphasis on dropping questions considered\nmeaningless. The second is the use of the language of information\ntheory (Spekkens 2014). The difference is mostly in the way the\nsubject holding information is treated. In RQM, this subject is fully\nnaturalised: it is itself considered a physical system that can be\ndescribed by quantum theory. This leads to a definitely stronger\nversion of realism that QBism, and to the emphasis on the relational\naspect of all variables. In QBism, instead, the emphasis is in the\ninformation about the world held by a single subject, taken as\nprimary. In RQM, the information is relative information (in the sense\nof Shannon) that a physical system has about another system; it is not\nprimary (see Dorato 2017): it is can be simply understood physically\nas a correlation between the two systems that can be observed by a\nthird system (Rovelli 1996).\n\nRichard Healey: Healey\u2019s pragmatist approach (Healey\n1989) has in common with RQM the idea that the quantum state is not a\ndescription of physical reality, not even incompletely. Its main\nfunction is to be a (dispensable) tool for generating quantum\nprobabilities. The main difference is the emphasis on what quantum\nstates are relative to. For Healey\u2019s pragmatist view, a quantum\nstate ascription is relative only to the perspective of an\nactual or potential agent (Healey 2012). In RQM, values are objective\nand relative to any physical system. Restricting quantum theory to its\nuse by agents is not a concern for Healey\u2019s pragmatist\nphilosophy; it is more so in a naturalistic perspective searching for\nan understanding of Nature that remains significative also where no\nagents are around. This is the same difference as between RQM and\nQBism, but Healey\u2019s position is closer to RQM than QBism because\nwhile the QBism\u2019s quantum state ascriptions depend on the\nepistemic state of the agent, for Healey the quantum state ascribed to\na system depends only on the physical circumstances defining the\nperspective of the agent.\n2.4 Representation\n\nThe issue of the interpretation of quantum mechanics is strictly\nrelated to the issue of the possibility of offering a\nrepresentation: a description of what happens in the world.\nIt can be useful to give a simple-minded pictorial representation of\nthe images sustaining different interpretations. Imagine at time\n\\(t_1\\) a radioactive atom is surrounded by Geiger counters and at\ntime \\(t_2\\) one of the counters clicks, having detected a product of\nthe decay. What has happened around the \\(t_1\\)-\\(t_2\\) interval?\n\nAccording to textbook quantum theory, the wave function\nof a particle classically trapped in the nucleus leaks out of the\nnucleus symmetrically, filling the space surrounding the nucleus. At\nthe moment of the detection this wave function magically disappears\neverywhere except at the particular detector that clicks.\nAccording to the the Many Worlds interpretation, all\ndetectors click. In fact, each detector clicks at every moment of\ntime, but the wave function of the universe branches continuously into\ninnumerable branches: we, ourselves, happen to be in one particular\nbranch in which one particular detector clicks at one particular\ntime.\nAccording to the Bohmiam interpretation, the wave\nfunction equally leaks uniformly in space, but at the same time the\nassociated particle, guided by this wave function, zigzags around,\nuntil hitting a particular detector.\nAccording to Physical Collapse interpretations, the wave\nfunction also leaks out uniformly, but when it effect on the heavy\nGeiger detectors begins to displace too much matter, the wave function\ncollapses as in the textbook interpretation, but driven by a\nhypothetical dynamical process which has not yet been explicitly\nobserved (Ghirardi 2002 [2018]).\nWhat about RQM? In the spirit of Heisenberg, there is no\nactual wave function in nature, nor there is any fact of the matter\nabout the position of the particle respect to the Geiger\ncounter at any moment between t1 and t2. However, there may be\nother facts of the matter. For instance, the position of the\nparticle respect to some air molecule along the way. These, on\nthe other hand, have no bearing on the the position of the particle\nrespect to the Geiger counter, which actualises at time t2 and whose\nprobabilistic distribution does not depend on the position of the\nparticle with respect to the air molecules.\n\n2.5 Frauchiger-Renner experiment and locality\n\nThe Frauchiger-Renner thought-experiment (Frauchiger & Renner\n2018) can be viewed as an indirect support to RQM, since it makes\nconcrete the idea that \u201cdifferent observers can give different\naccounts of the same set of events\u201d, as in the original RQM\nslogan (Rovelli 1996: 1463). The experiment is discussed in the\nconceptual framework of RQM by Waaijer and van Neerven (2019\n [OIR]).\n\nThe application of RQM to the EPR context and the problem of quantum\nnon locality has been initially discussed in Smerlak and Rovelli\n(2007) and (Laudisa 2001). Some of the claims of the earlier\ndiscussion about RQM being \u201clocal\u201d have been questioned,\npointing out that RQM should in any case be \u201cforced to accept\nsome form of non-locality in quantum phenomena\u201d\n(Laudisa 2019: 227). A more recent discussion is in Martin-Dussaud,\nRovelli, and Zalamea (2019), where a specific sense in which quantum\ntheory is non-local from the RQM perspective is specified, and\ndownplayed. See also Pienaar (2018\n [OIR])\n for comments.\n2.6 Solipsism?\n\nPrima facie, RQM may seem to imply a form of perspective solipsism, as\nthe values of variables realized in the perspective of some system\n\\(S'\\) are not necessarily the same as those realized with respect to\nanother system \\(S''\\). This is however not the case, as follows\ndirectly from quantum theory itself. The key is to observe that any\nphysical comparison is itself a quantum interaction. Suppose the\nvariable \\(A\\) of \\(S\\) is measured by \\(S'\\) and stored into the\nvariable \\(A'\\) of \\(S'\\). This means that the interaction has created\na correlation between \\(A\\) and \\(A'\\). In turn, this means that a\nthird system measuring \\(A\\) and \\(A'\\) will certainly find consistent\nvalues. That is: the perspectives of \\(S'\\) and \\(S''\\) agree on this\nregard, and this can be checked in a physical interaction.\n\nFor instance: imagine experimenter \\(S'\\) measures the spin of the\nelectron \\(S\\), and writes the value of this spin on a piece of paper.\nIn principle, experimenter \\(S''\\) can devise an experiment where she\ncan detect an effect due to interference between the two branches\nwhere the spin of the electron (and the text) have one or the other\nvalue. But if \\(S''\\) measures the spin and reads the piece of paper,\nshe will find that experimenter \\(S'\\) has seen the same spin as\nherself.\n\nWhy? Because quantum theory predicts so, as can be seen from the\nfollowing: with respect to \\(S''\\), the first interaction yields a\nquantum state of the form \n\n\\[ \\begin{align} & \\ket{\\text{spin up}} \\times \\ket{\\text{paper\nwith text } \\lsq\\text{spin up}\\rsq} \\\\ & + \n\\ket{\\text{spin down}} \\times\n\\ket{\\text{paper with text } \\lsq\\text{spin down}\\rsq} \\end{align} \\]\n\n\nMeasuring the spin projects the state on one single branch of the two,\nand both branches lead to consistency. Therefore, as long as we do not\nchase subtle interference phenomena hidden behind decoherence, RQM\nimplies that we all \u2018see the same world\u2019.\n3. General Comments\n3.1 Realism and Relationality\n\nThe central move of RQM is to interpret all physical variables as\nrelational, namely as referring to two systems, not a single one, and\nto view them as realised only in interactions. Relationality has been\nplaying an ever dominant role as our knowledge of the natural world\nhas increased. Examples are the relational nature of velocity in\nclassical mechanics, of locality in general relativity, of the\npotential in electromagnetism, of the gauge invariant observables in\nnon-abelian gauge theories, and many others. RQM is a step further in\nthis direction. Taken seriously, the philosophical implications of\nthis overreaching relationally can be heavy. The main one is a\nweakening of a strong version of realism.\n\nIf by realism we mean the assumption that the world is \u201cout\nthere\u201d, irrespectively of our mental states, or perceptions,\nthere is nothing in RQM that contradicts realism. But if by realism we\nmean the stronger assumption that each variables of each subsystem of\nthe world has a single value at each and every time, then this strong\nversion of realism is weakened by RQM. The ontology of RQM is a sparse\n(\u201cflash\u201d) ontology of relational quantum events, taken as\nprimitive, and not derived from any \u201cunderlying\u201d\nrepresentation.\n\nThis weakening of realism is in a direction similar to what happened\nwith Galilean or Einstein\u2019s relativity, which have shown that\nthere is no fact of the matter in the velocity of a single object, or\nin the simultaneity of two space like separated events alone. But is a\nmore radical step in this direction. In Laudisa (2019) it is pointed\nout that RQM gives no deeper justification or underlying dynamical\nrepresentation of the main process: the actualisation of quantum\nevents at interactions. This is the process which in textbook quantum\ntheory is called measurement and is accompanied by state reduction.\nQuantum mechanics gives probabilities for quantum events to happen,\nnot a story representing how they happen. This core aspect of quantum\ntheory is not resolved in RQM: it is taken as a fact of the world.\nWhat RQM does resolve is the question of when this happens: any time\none system affects another one, it happens relative to this other\nsystem. What RQM does, is to show that this is not in contradiction\nwith the existence of interference effects. But the core discreteness\nof the quantum event actualisation is not \u201cexplained\u201d in\nRQM: it is understood as the picture of how nature works according to\nquantum theory.\n\nThe weakening of realism is the \u201cprice to pay\u201d for the\nrelational interpretation of quantum mechanics. It can be compared\nwith the \u201cprice to pay\u201d in other interpretations, such as\nthe inflated ontology and the distance between the ontology and the\nworld as we see it of the Many Worlds interpretation, the existence of\nvariables unobservables in principle and the loss of Lorentz\ninvariance of Bohm theory, and so on.\n\nThe other side of the coin of each \u201cprice to pay\u201d is the\nlesson we might gather from the empirical success of quantum theory:\nfor the Many Worlds interpretation, for instance, the lesson is the\nreal existence of other branches, for Bohm theory is the real\nexistence of unobservable variables that pick a preferred reference\nframe, and so on. For RQM, the lesson of quantum theory is that the\ndescription of the way distinct physical systems affect each other\nwhen they interact (and not the way physical systems\n\u2018are\u2019) exhausts all that can be said about the physical\nworld. The physical world must be described as a net of interacting\ncomponents, where there is no meaning to \u2018the state of an\nisolated system\u2019, or the value of the variables of an isolated\nsystem. The state of a physical system is the net of the relations it\nentertains with the surrounding systems. The physical structure of the\nworld is identified as this net of relationships. The notion of\nsubstance that plays a major role in western philosophy might be\ninappropriate to account for this science; perhaps the idea of a\n\u201cmutual dependency\u201d [N\u0101g\u0101rjuna 1995] may offer a\nrelevant philosophical cadre.\n3.2 Reactions and criticisms\n\nIn van Fraassen (2010), Bas van Fraassen explores \u201cthe world of\nquantum mechanics as RQM depicts it\u201d (2010: 390), clarifying\nwhat is and what is not relative to observers. He concentrates on the\napparently paradoxical aspects of RQM. The limits on information that\nobservers can have, which can only be acquired through physical\ninteraction, have surprising consequences for complex situations in\nwhich an observer makes a measurement, a second observer makes\nmeasurements on the first and its target, and even a third observer\ncomes in and observes a process involving the first two observers. Van\nFraassen concludes that all the consistency questions can be laid to\nrest, when the situation\u2019s representation in RQM is properly\nunderstood. On the other hand, he also observes that if in RQM what\nthe state of a system relative to an observer is, is not itself\nrelative to anything, then the question can be raised what\nrelationships there are between the state of a specific entangled\nsystem or its components relative to different observers. He proposes\nand additional postulate, weakly relating the description of the same\nsystem as given by different observers, which forbids the possibility\nof disturbing inconsistencies allowed by the multiplication of\nperspectives.\n\nLaura Candiotto (2017) argues that the best philosophical framework\nfor RQM is Ontic Structural Realism (OSR) (Ladyman& Ross 2007;\nFrench & Ladyman 2011). Ontic structural realism is meant to be a\ndefensible form of scientific realism (Ladyman 2007 [2019]); it argues\nfor the priority of relations over substances, as self-subsistent\nindividual objects (Morganti 2011). For Candiotto, RQM is a realistic\ntheory that assumes the notion of relation (the physical interaction\nbetween systems and instruments) as primitive; objects emerge as\nrelational \u201cnodes\u201d (French 2006), or intersections of\nprocesses. The lack of observer-independence is not inability of\nproviding an account of the structure of matter, because there are no\nintrinsic properties that can be assigned to systems independently of\ntheir interactions, therefore this structure is itself relational,\nhence in particular observer dependent. Relations via dynamical\nprocesses of information exchange can be taken as the building blocks\nof the universe.\n\nThe relation between RQM and ontic structural realism has been\nemphasized also by Mauro Dorato (2016). Dorato gives an extensive\nevaluation of RQM, pointing out its main characteristics. He\nemphasises then two aspects that characterise RQM. The first is a\nrevisionary rather than a descriptive metaphysical account of quantum\ntheory; that is: central assumptions of common sense must go, if they\ncontradict contemporary physical theories. Here, what is abandoned is\nthe presupposition that quantum systems have a non-relational,\nintrinsic nature. RQM\u2019s metaphysics is revisionary also for a\nsecond reason. Analogously to the many-worlds interpretation, RQM does\nnot suggest changing the formalism of quantum theory\u2014as\nalternative formulations of the theory do\u2014but rather, modifies\nthe conceptual schemes with which we can interpret the formalism, and\nconsequently, our metaphysics. Dorato observes that the relativisation\nof values implies a relativisation of the very notion of object or\nentity, if (i) having some intrinsic, non-purely dispositional\nproperties is essential to the identity of an object, and (ii) no\nentity can exist if it does not have an intrinsic identity (see\nN\u0101g\u0101rjuna c. 2nd century CE [1995]). The only reality in RQM\nis given by events, which are the result of interactions between\ndistinct quantum systems, but even these events can be described in a\ndifferent way by different physical systems. The interaction cannot be\ndescribed in a more precise way by a constructive theory in\nEinstein\u2019s sense (Einstein 1919) that can explain the coming\ninto being of a definite outcome without just assuming it as a\nfundamental fact. Dorato concludes that there is no measurement\nproblem in RQM because RQM is implicitly formulated as a theory of\nprinciple. He also considers the issue of priority monism as defined\nin Schaffer (2010): Shaffer claims that quantum mechanics\u2019\nentanglement is evidence that the whole universe has ontological\npriority with respect to its parts. Dorato point out that the firm\nadvocacy of relationalism of RQM has instead radical anti-holistic\nconsequences.\n\nThe second characteristic aspect of RQM pointed out by Dorato is that,\nconsequently, the best way to capture the nature of not-yet\ninteracting quantum systems is to call into play a form of\ndispositionalism: the only way to attribute some sort of intrinsicness\nto the state-dependent properties of quantum systems is to attribute\nthem dispositions to manifest in a certain way according to the\ninteractions they are subject to. Dispositionalism is present in many\nother views of quantum mechanics (Dorato 2006) but fits particularly\nwell in the context of RQM. Unlike Qbists interpretations of quantum\ntheory, which are agents-centered, in RQM the relation \u201c\\(S\\)\nmanifest \\(q\\) relative to \\(S'\\)\u201d is symmetric, and this is a\nsimple consequence of the hypothesis that in RQM quantum systems and\n\u201cobservers\u201d are on the same level. As a consequence of its\nrelational and dispositional aspect, Dorato stresses the fact that in\nRQM there cannot be a universal flow of becoming, but only a local,\nworldline-dependent and relational one. This still counts as a\nrelational form of becoming: no universal tide of coming into being,\nbut a crisscross of ripples. Since a physical system can exemplify a\ngiven succession of events only relatively to another system and not\nabsolutely, in RQM there cannot be cosmic time, so that also in\ngeneral relativity temporal succession of events cannot be regarded as\na total order. In a sense, in RQM there is no quantum state of the\nuniverse, or a God\u2019s eye point of view, since the cosmos can\nonly be described \u201cfrom within a given perspective\u201d.\n",
