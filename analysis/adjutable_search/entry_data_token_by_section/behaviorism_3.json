    "main_text": "Popularity of Behaviorism\n4. Popularity of Behaviorism\n\nBehaviorism of one sort or another was an immensely popular research\nprogram or methodological commitment among students of behavior from\nabout the third decade of the twentieth century through its middle\ndecades, at least until the beginnings of the cognitive science\nrevolution. Cognitive science began to mature roughly from 1960 until\n1985 (see Bechtel, Abrahamsen, and Graham 1998, pp. 15\u201317). In\naddition to Ryle and Wittgenstein, philosophers with sympathies for\nbehaviorism included Carnap (1932\u201333), Hempel (1949), and Quine\n(1960). Quine, for example, took a behaviorist approach to the study\nof language. Quine claimed that the notion of psychological or mental\nactivity has no place in a scientific account of either the origins or\nthe meaning of speech. To talk in a scientifically disciplined manner\nabout the meaning of an utterance is to talk about stimuli for the\nutterance, its so-called \u201cstimulus meaning\u201d. Hempel (1949)\nclaimed that \u201call psychological statements that are meaningful\n\u2026 are translatable into statements that do not involve\npsychological concepts,\u201d but only concepts for physical behavior\n(p. 18).\n\nAmong psychologists behaviorism was even more popular than among\nphilosophers. In addition to Pavlov, Skinner, Thorndike, and Watson,\nthe list of behaviorists among psychologists included, among others,\nE. C. Tolman (1886\u20131959), C. L. Hull (1884\u201352), and E. R.\nGuthrie (1886\u20131959). Tolman, for example, wrote that\n\u201ceverything important in psychology \u2026 can be investigated\nin essence through the continued experimental and theoretical analysis\nof the determiners of rat behavior at a choice point in a maze\u201d\n(1938, p. 34).\n\nBehaviorists created journals, organized societies, and founded\npsychology graduate programs reflective of behaviorism. Behaviorists\norganized themselves into different types of research clusters, whose\ndifferences stemmed from such factors as varying approaches to\nconditioning and experimentation. Some clusters were named as follows:\n\u201cthe experimental analysis of behavior\u201d, \u201cbehavior\nanalysis\u201d, \u201cfunctional analysis\u201d, and, of course,\n\u201cradical behaviorism\u201d. These labels sometimes were\nresponsible for the titles of behaviorism\u2019s leading societies\nand journals, including the Society for the Advancement of Behavior\nAnalysis (SABA), and the Journal of the Experimental Analysis of\nBehavior (begun in 1958) as well as the Journal of Applied Behavior\nAnalysis (begun in 1968).\n\nBehaviorism generated a type of therapy, known as behavior therapy\n(see Rimm and Masters 1974; Erwin 1978). It developed behavior\nmanagement techniques for autistic children (see Lovaas and Newsom\n1976) and token economies for the management of chronic schizophrenics\n(see Stahl and Leitenberg 1976). It fueled discussions of how best to\nunderstand the behavior of nonhuman animals and of the relevance of\nlaboratory study to the natural environmental occurrence of animal\nbehavior (see Schwartz and Lacey 1982).\n\nBehaviorism stumbled upon various critical difficulties with some of\nits commitments. One difficulty is confusion about the effects of\nreinforcement on behavior (see Gallistel 1990). In its original sense,\na stimulus such as food is a reinforcer only if its presentation\nincreases the frequency of a response in a type of associative\nconditioning known as operant conditioning. A problem with this\ndefinition is that it defines reinforcers as stimuli that change\nbehavior. The presentation of food, however, may have no observable\neffect on response frequency with respect to food even in cases in\nwhich an animal is food deprived or hungry. Rather, response frequency\ncan be associated with an animal\u2019s ability to identify and\nremember temporal or spatial properties of the circumstances in which\na stimulus (say, food) is presented. This and other difficulties\nprompted changes in behaviorism\u2019s commitments and new directions\nof research. One alternative direction has been the study of the role\nof short term memory in contributing to reinforcement effects on the\nso-called trajectory of behavior (see Killeen 1994).\n\nAnother stumbling block, in the case of analytical behaviorism, is the\nfact that the behavioral sentences that are intended to offer the\nbehavioral paraphrases of mental terms almost always use mental terms\nthemselves (see Chisholm 1957). In the example of my belief that I\nhave a 2pm dental appointment, one must also speak of my desire to\narrive at 2pm, otherwise the behavior of arriving at 2pm could not\ncount as believing that I have a 2pm appointment. The term\n\u201cdesire\u201d is a mental term. Critics of analytical\nbehaviorism have charged that we can never escape from using mental\nterms in the characterization of the meaning of mental terms. This\nsuggests that mental discourse cannot be displaced by behavioral\ndiscourse. At least it cannot be displaced term-by-term. Perhaps\nanalytical behaviorists need to paraphrase a whole swarm of mental\nterms at once so as to recognize the presumption that the attribution\nof any one such mental term presupposes the application of others (see\nRey 1997, p. 154\u20135).\n",
