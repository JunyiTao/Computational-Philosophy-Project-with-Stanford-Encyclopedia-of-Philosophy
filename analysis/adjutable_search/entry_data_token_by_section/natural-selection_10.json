    "main_text": "Causation\n6. Conclusion\n\nThis entry initially distinguished two usages of \u201cnatural\nselection\u201d, the focused and the capacious one, the focused one\npicking out a single formal element of the process captured by the\ncapacious sense. There are some intermediate cases. Brandon offers\nthis definition of selection: selection is differential reproduction\nthat is due to differential adaptedness to a common selective\nenvironment (Brandon 2005: 160). This definition does not attempt to\ncapture the entirety of Darwin\u2019s process: while it identifies\nnatural selection with a type of reproduction, there is no mention of\ninheritance or replication. Repeat a process specified to fit\nBrandon\u2019s definition as often as you like and we still might not\nhave something that makes adaptation or speciation explicable. But\nneither is Brandon\u2019s definition of selection appropriate as an\ninterpretation of a theoretical term in any formalism. Instead, that\ndefinition connects with an effort to develop a Principle of\nNatural Selection which would serve a seminal role in a\nqualitative version of Darwin\u2019s theory. The Principle is\nformulated using probability talk along with the notion of fitness.\nThe historical development of the Principle of Natural Selection,\nbeginning with Brandon together with Beatty and Mills (Brandon 1978;\nMills & Beatty 1979), has been guided by debates over the\ninterpretation of probability and fitness addressed elsewhere (Brandon\n1990: ch. 1; Sober 2000; Campbell & Robert 2005; entry on\n fitness).\n\n\u201cNatural selection\u201d has been used to pick out one, or\nmultiple, or all the elements of a single cycle of the recursive\nprocess that we learned from Darwin. Seemingly, there is arbitrariness\nin how one decides to deploy the term natural selection, such that any\npart of Darwin\u2019s recursive process could be treated as the\nnatural selection part. It is difficult to say that either\nBrandon, or Okasha, or Otsuka, or Millstein is wrong in their\ncharacterizations of selection, even though the characterizations are\nsuperficially logically incompatible. The several definitions pick out\ngenuine elements of genuine processes, each with their own significant\ntheoretical importance.\n",
