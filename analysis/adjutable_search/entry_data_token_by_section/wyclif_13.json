    "main_text": "Religious and Political Thought || The Bible and the Church\n5.1 The Bible and the Church\n\nWyclif conceives of Sacred Scripture as a direct emanation from God\nhimself, and therefore as a timeless, unchanging, and archetypal truth\nindependent of the present world and of the concrete material text by\nmeans of which it is manifested. As a consequence, in his De\nveritate Sacrae Scripturae (On the Truth of Sacred\nScripture \u2014 between late 1377 and the end of 1378) he tries\nto show that, despite appearences, the Bible is free from error and\ncontradictions. The exegetic principle he adopts is the following:\nsince the authority of Scripture is greater than our capacity of\nunderstanding, if some errors and/or inconsistencies are found in the\nBible, there is something wrong with our interpretation. The Bible\ncontains the whole truth and nothing but the truth, so that nothing\ncan be added to it or subtracted from it. Every part of it has to be\ntaken absolutely and without qualification (De veritate Sacrae\nScripturae, vol. 1, pp. 1\u20132, 395, 399; vol. 2, pp. 99,\n181\u201384).\n\nIn attributing inerrancy to the Bible, Wyclif was following the\ntraditional attitude towards it, but the way he viewed the book\ndetached him from Catholic tradition, as he thought that his own\nmetaphysical system was the necessary interpretative key for the\ncorrect understanding of Biblical truth. In fact, in the\nTrialogus (Trialogue \u2014 between late 1382 and\nearly 1383), where Wyclif gives us the conditions for achieving the\ntrue meaning of the Bible, they are the following:\n\nknowledge of the nature and ontological status of universals;\nknowledge of the peculiar nature of accidents as dependent in\nexistence on their substantial substrates;\nknowledge of past and future states of affairs\n(praeteritiones and futuritiones) as real in the\npresent as past and future truths, not as things (res) that\nhave been real in the past and will be real in the future (a thesis of\nhis already claimed in the De ente praedicamentali, chap. 1,\npp. 2 and 5; Purgans errores circa veritates in communi,\nchap. 1, pp. 1\u20132; chap. 3, pp. 10\u201311);\nknowledge of the eternal existence of creatures in God at the\nlevel of intelligible being really identical with the divine essence\nitself;\nknowledge of the perpetual existence of material essences\n(Trialogus, book 3, chap. 31, pp. 242\u201343).\n\n\nOnly on the basis of this logical and metaphysical machinery is it\npossible to grasp the five different levels of reality of the Bible,\nwhich are at the same time:\n\nthe book of life mentioned in the Apocalypse;\nthe ideal being proper to the truths written in the book of\nlife;\nthe truths that are to be believed as they are written in the book\nof life;\nthe truths that are to believed as they are written in the natural\nbooks that are men\u2019s souls;\nall the artificial signs of the truth (De veritate Sacrae\nScripturae, vol. 1, p. 109).\n\n\nThis same approach, when applied to the Church, led Wyclif to fight\nagainst it in its contemporary state. (On Wyclif\u2019s ecclesiology\nsee Leff 1967, pp. 516\u201346.) The starting point of Wyclif\u2019s\nreflection on the Church is the distinction between the heavenly and\nthe earthly cities that St. Augustine draws in his De civitate\nDei. In St. Augustine such a division is metaphorical, but Wyclif\nmade it literal. So he claims that the Holy Catholic Church is the\nmystical and indivisible community of the saved, eternally bound\ntogether by the grace of predestination, while the foreknown, i.e. the\ndamned, are eternally excluded from it (De civili dominio,\nvol. 1, p. 11). This community of the elect is really distinct from\nthe various particular earthly churches (ibid., p. 381). It\nis timeless and outside space, and therefore is not a physical entity;\nits being, like the actual being of any other universal, is wherever\nany of its members is (De ecclesia, p. 99). All its members\nalways remain in grace, even if temporally in mortal sin\n(ibid., p. 409), as conversely the damned remain in mortal\nsin, even if temporally in grace (ibid., p. 139). The true\nChurch is presently divided into three parts: the triumphant Church in\nheaven; the sleeping Church in purgatory; and the militant Church on\nearth (ibid., p. 8). But the militant Church on earth cannot\nbe identified with the visible church and its hierarchy. Even more,\nsince we cannot know who are the elect, there is no reason for\nconsenting to recognize and obey the authority of the visible church\n(see De civili dominio, vol. 1, p. 409; De ecclesia,\npp. 71\u20132). Authority and dominion rely on God\u2019s law\nmanifested by Sacred Scripture. As a consequence, obedience to any\nmember of the hierarchy is to be subordinated to his fidelity to the\nprecepts of the Bible (De civili dominio, vol. 2, p. 243;\nDe potestate papae [On the Power of the Pope \u2014\nca. 1379], p. 149; De ecclesia, p. 465). Faithfulness to the\ntrue Church can entail the necessity of rebelling against the visible\nchurch and its members, when their requests are in conflict with the\nteaching of Christ (De civili dominio, vol. 1, pp. 384,\n392).\n\nIn conclusion, since the visible church cannot help the believers gain\nsalvation, which is fixed from eternity, and its authority depends on\nits fidelity to divine revelation, it cannot perform any of the\nfunctions traditionally attributed to it, and it therefore has no\nreason for its own existence. To be ordained a priest offers no\ncertainty of divine approval and authority (De ecclesia, p.\n577). Orthodoxy can only result from the application of right reason\nto the faith of the Bible (De veritate Sacrae Scripturae,\nvol. 1, p. 249). The Pope, bishops, abbots, and priests are expected\nto prove that they really belong to the Holy Catholic Church through\ntheir exemplary behavior; they should be poor and free from worldly\nconcerns, and they should spend their time preaching and praying\n(De ecclesia, pp. 41, 89, 129). In particular, the Pope\nshould not interfere in worldly matters, but should be an example of\nholiness. Believers are always allowed to doubt the clergy\u2019s\nlegitimacy, which can be evaluated only on the basis of its\nconsistency with the Evangelic rules (ibid., pp. 43, 456).\nUnworthy priests forfeit their right to exercise authority and to hold\nproperty, and lay lords might deprive them of their benefices (De\ncivili dominio, vol. 1, p. 353; vol. 3, pp. 326, 413; De\necclesia, p. 257).\n",
