Personal Relations, Family, and Disability\n\nAlthough the connection between disability and interpersonal\nrelationships is a topic worth exploring in its own right, it also has\nimportant implications for well-being and health. Numerous empirical\nstudies across a number of behavioral science and medical disciplines\nhave shown the importance of close interpersonal relationships for\nhealth and well-being (Cohen, Gottlieb, and Underwood 2001; Uchino,\nCacioppo and Kiecolt-Glaser 1996; Cohen and Wills 1985). For example,\nmore than 130 empirical studies have shown that on a number of\nwell-being indices, married men and women are generally happier and\nless stressed than unmarried people (Coombs 1991). Personal\nrelationships, including love and friendship, are for most people an\nessential ingredient of the life they want for themselves, something\nto value for their own sake as well as for the support they provide\nduring stressful times. However, many people see disability as an\nobstacle to friendship, romantic love, and rewarding family life.\nDisability scholars and activists reject this widespread belief,\narguing that the obstacles that exist to accessing such relationships\nare due primarily to features of the social and physical\nenvironment.\n\nIn this section, we discuss the perceived barriers to such\nrelationships. Clearly, one\u2019s view about the effect of\ndisability on interpersonal relationships depends on one\u2019s\nconception of disability and on one\u2019s conception of the relevant\ninterpersonal relationships, such as friendship and love. As is\nevident from the discussions in the \u201cFriendship\u201d and\n\u201cLove\u201d entries in this encyclopedia, there is lively\ndebate among philosophers concerning the nature and value of love and\nfriendship.\n",
