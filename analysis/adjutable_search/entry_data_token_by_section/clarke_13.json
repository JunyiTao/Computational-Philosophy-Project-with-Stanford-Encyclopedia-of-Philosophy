    "main_text": "Philosophical Theology || Miracles\n4.4 Miracles\n\nLike many associated with the Royal Society, Clarke thought that\nmiracles could be used as evidence for the claim that Christianity is\nthe true religion. However, given that matter is inactive, God is\nactively involved in all or nearly all events in the world. What then\ncould separate out a particular action of God as miraculous? According\nto Clarke, a miracle is a \u201cwork effected in a manner\nunusual, or different from the common and regular Method of\nProvidence, by the interposition either of God himself, or of some\nIntelligent Agent superior to Man, for the Proof or Evidence of some\nparticular Doctrine, or in attestation to the Authority of some\nparticular Person\u201d (W 2.701).\n\nMiracles became a point of controversy in the letters that passed\nbetween Clarke and Leibniz (W 4.605). One focus of the debate is which\nwould be greater: a world so perfectly crafted that God does not need\nto intervene to keep it running (Leibniz), or a world so dependent on\nGod that one cannot understand the world without recognizing its\ncontinual dependence on the operations of God (Clarke). A second focus\nof the debate is the proper understanding of a miracle: something that\nexceeds the natural power of created things (Leibniz), or something\nthat seems different from our human expectation of how things operate\n(Clarke).\n\nClarke maintains that miracles are miraculous only from a human\nperspective and that God actively and continuously works in the\nphysical world because matter is completely passive. Since God\u2019s\nwisdom and goodness are unchanging, if God chooses to act differently\nin the world at a certain time (e.g., by changing the laws of motion),\nit is only because it was always good to do so and was part of\nGod\u2019s plan from eternity. Because it requires no more power for\nGod to do the miraculous-to-us as to do the natural-to-us, neither one\nis \u201cwith Respect to God, more or less Natural\nor Supernatural than the other.\u201d From our perspective,\nGod is changing the order of things; from God\u2019s perspective,\neverything is equally a part of God\u2019s design. A miracle, then,\nis only a miracle \u201cwith Regard to our\nConceptions\u201d (C2.6\u201312, W 4.598\u2013601). In his\nfinal letter Clarke elaborates on this, suggesting that we call\nthe sun stopping in the sky miraculous only because it is unusual; if it\nwas always at the same point in the sky, then that would be natural,\nand its motion miraculous. Similarly, raising a dead body from the\nground is miraculous, but only because God does not usually act that\nway (C5.107\u2013109, W 4.693; C3.17, W 4.611\u2013612). Unusualness\nis a necessary but not sufficient condition for being a miracle\n(C4.43, W 4.629\u2013630), but Clarke nowhere says what else is\nrequired.\n\nLeibniz attacks Clarke\u2019s position from multiple angles.\nLeibniz\u2019s first letter accuses Newton of making an imperfect\nmachine that requires tuning to keep it running, like a watch that\nrequires winding, but this is unfitting a perfect God. In\nNewton\u2019s world, miracles are required \u201cin order to supply\nthe Wants of Nature\u201d (L1.4, W 4.588). Clarke responds that there\nis a disanalogy between the watch and the world. The watch requires\nwinding because a human watchmaker can only compose parts and put them\nin motion, whereas God is both the creator and preserver of forces and\npowers. On the offensive, Clarke charges those who deny God\u2019s\nconstant involvement in the world to be allowing a mechanical world, a\nworld of \u201cMaterialism and Fate,\u201d where\nGod is not needed at all (C1.4, W 4.590). In response, Leibniz makes\nthe interesting objection that either Clarke is explaining natural\nthings by the supernatural, which is absurd, or else God is a part of\nnature (specifically, the soul of the world) (L2.12, W 4.596;\nL4.110\u201311, W 4.666). Leibniz also charges that Clarke cannot\nexplain the difference between natural and supernatural action.\n\u201cBut it is regular, (says the Author,) it is\nconstant, and consequently natural. I answer; it\ncannot be regular, without being reasonable; nor natural, unless it\ncan be explained by the Natures of creatures\u201d (L5.121, W\n4.668\u2013669). Regularities require explanations, and to be natural\nthese explanations must come from the natures of the creatures. The\nClarkean picture, in which matter is completely passive, is incapable\nof explaining the regularities exhibited in the interaction of\nmaterial bodies in terms of those bodies. Whereas Clarke saw this as\nthe pinnacle of what natural philosophy contributes to natural\ntheology, Leibniz saw it as a failure to exhibit a fully rational\nworld suited to being created by a perfectly good God.\n",
