    "main_text": "\n\n\nPythagoras, one of the most famous and controversial ancient Greek\nphilosophers, lived from ca. 570 to ca. 490 BCE. He spent his early\nyears on the island of Samos, off the coast of modern Turkey. At the\nage of forty, however, he emigrated to the city of Croton in southern\nItaly and most of his philosophical activity occurred\nthere. Pythagoras wrote nothing, nor were there any detailed accounts\nof his thought written by contemporaries. By the first centuries BCE,\nmoreover, it became fashionable to present Pythagoras in a largely\nunhistorical fashion as a semi-divine figure, who originated all that\nwas true in the Greek philosophical tradition, including many of\nPlato\u2019s and Aristotle\u2019s mature ideas. A number of treatises were\nforged in the name of Pythagoras and other Pythagoreans in order to\nsupport this view.\n\n  The Pythagorean question, then, is how to get behind this false\nglorification of Pythagoras in order to determine what the historical\nPythagoras actually thought and did. In order to obtain an accurate\nappreciation of Pythagoras\u2019 achievement, it is important to rely on\nthe earliest evidence before the distortions of the later tradition\narose. The popular modern image of Pythagoras is that of a master\nmathematician and scientist. The early evidence shows, however, that,\nwhile Pythagoras was famous in his own day and even 150 years later in\nthe time of Plato and Aristotle, it was not mathematics or science\nupon which his fame rested. Pythagoras was famous (1) as an expert on\nthe fate of the soul after death, who thought that the soul was\nimmortal and went through a series of reincarnations; (2) as an expert\non religious ritual; (3) as a wonder-worker who had a thigh of gold\nand who could be two places at the same time; (4) as the founder of a\nstrict way of life that emphasized dietary restrictions, religious\nritual and rigorous self discipline. \n\n It remains controversial whether he also engaged in the rational\ncosmology that is typical of the Presocratic philosopher/scientists\nand whether he was in any sense a mathematician. The early evidence\nsuggests, however, that Pythagoras presented a cosmos that was\nstructured according to moral principles and significant numerical\nrelationships and may have been akin to conceptions of the cosmos\nfound in Platonic myths, such as those at the end of the\nPhaedo and Republic. In such a cosmos, the planets\nwere seen as instruments of divine vengeance (\u201cthe hounds of\nPersephone\u201d), the sun and moon are the isles of the blessed\nwhere we may go, if we live a good life, while thunder functioned to\nfrighten the souls being punished in Tartarus. The heavenly bodies\nalso appear to have moved in accordance with the mathematical ratios\nthat govern the concordant musical intervals in order to produce a\nmusic of the heavens, which in the later tradition developed into\n\u201cthe harmony of the spheres.\u201d It is doubtful that\nPythagoras himself thought in terms of spheres, and the mathematics of\nthe movements of the heavens was not worked out in detail.  There is\nevidence that he valued relationships between numbers such as those\nembodied in the so-called Pythagorean theorem, though it is not likely\nthat he proved the theorem. In recent scholarship this consensus view\nhas received strong challenges, which will be discussed below.\n\n  Pythagoras\u2019 cosmos was developed in a more scientific and\nmathematical direction by his successors in the Pythagorean tradition,\nPhilolaus and Archytas. Pythagoras succeeded in promulgating a new\nmore optimistic view of the fate of the soul after death and in\nfounding a way of life that was attractive for its rigor and\ndiscipline and that drew to him numerous devoted followers.\n",
