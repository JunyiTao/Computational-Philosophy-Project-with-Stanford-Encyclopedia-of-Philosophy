    "main_text": "Contemporary Relevance || Philosophy of Health and Illness\n7.6 Philosophy of Health and Illness\n\n\nOutside of the humanities and social sciences, existentialism has\nalso had a deep and lasting impact on the allied health professions.\nThe role it has played in the development of existential and humanistic\napproaches to psychotherapy (Cooper 2003; Spinneli 2007; van Deurzen\n2015) and to phenomenological psychopathology (Parnas & Gallagher\n2015; Ratcliffe 2015; Stanghellini et al. 2019) is well-known, but in\nrecent years we have seen its influence emerge in a range of different\nareas, from narrative medicine to nursing, and from gerontology to\npalliative care. To this end, existentialism has informed a move away\nfrom the reductive and objectifying tendencies of modern biomedicine to\nrecover the first-person experience of health and illness, viewing the\nbody not so much as a biophysical machine that needs to be adjusted and\nmaintained but as the experiential and interpretative medium of our\nexistence. This shift has not only allowed clinicians to challenge the\nemergent tendency to medicalize ever-expanding swaths of the human\ncondition; it makes it possible for the clinician to better understand\nthe patient\u2019s experience by getting a sense of \u201cwhat it\nmeans\u201d and \u201cwhat it feels like\u201d to suffer when the\nbody breaks down (Aho 2018; Slatman 2014; Svenaeus 2022; Zeiler &\nK\u00e4ll 2014).\n",
