    "main_text": "Yog\u0101c\u0101ra || Conventional Truth\n3.1 Conventional Truth\n\nEtymologically the term conventional truth covers the sense of what we\nordinarily take as commonsensical truths. However, in contrast with\nna\u00efve realism associated with common sense notions of truths, for\nthe Yog\u0101c\u0101ra the term \u201cconventional truth\u201d has\nsomewhat a negative connotation. It exclusively refers to objects of\nknowledge like forms, sound etc., the mode of existence or mode of\nbeing which radically contradicts with the mode of its appearance, and\nthus they are false, unreal, and deceptive. Forms, sounds, etc., are\ndefined as conventional entities in that they are realities from the\nperspective of, or by the force of, three forms of convention:\n\nfabrication (asatkalpita),\nconsciousness (vij\u00f1\u0101na), or\nlanguage, signifier, a convenient designator (\u015babda).\n\n\nA conventional truth is therefore a truth by virtue of being\nfabricated by the conceptual mind; or it is truth erroneously\napprehended by means of the dualistic consciousness; or it is true\nconcept, meaning, signified and designated by a convenient\ndesignator/signifier.\n\nBecause the Yog\u0101c\u0101rins admit three conventions, it also\nadmits three categories of conventional truths:\n\nfabricated phenomena;\nmind/consciousness; and\nlanguage since conventional truths exist due to the force of these\nthree conventions.\n\n\nThe first and the last are categories of imaginary phenomena\n(parikalpita) and the second is dependent phenomena (paratantra).\n\nThe Yog\u0101c\u0101ra\u2019s claim that external objects are not even\nconventionally real, what is conventionally real are only our\nimpressions, and mental representations is one Vasubandhu closely\ndefends by means of the Yog\u0101c\u0101ra\u2019s theory of the three\nnatures (trisvabh\u0101va). In his Discernment of the\nThree Natures (Trisvabh\u0101vak\u0101rik\u0101, or\nTrisvabh\u0101vanirde\u015ba [TSN]; Sems tsam shi\n10a\u201311b), Vasubandhu explains that the Yog\u0101c\u0101ra\nontology and phenomenology as consisting of the unity of three natures\n(svabh\u0101va):\n\nthe dependent or other (paratantra);\nthe imaginary / conceptual (parikalpita); and\nthe perfect / ultimate (parini\u1e63panna) ([TSN] 1,\nSems tsam shi 10a)\n\n\nThe first two account for conventional truth and the latter ultimate\ntruth. We shall consider the import of the three in turn.\n\nFirst, Vasubandhu defines the dependent nature as: (a) one that exists\ndue to being causally conditioned\n(pratyay\u0101dh\u012bnav\u1e5bttitv\u0101t), and (b) it is the basis\nof \u201cwhat appears\u201d (yat khy\u0101ti) mistakenly in our\ncognition as conventionally real, it is the basis for the\n\u201cunreal conceptual fabrication\u201d (asatkalpa) which is the\nphenomenological basis of the appearance of reified subjects and\nobjects ([TSN] 2 Sems tsam shi 10a). The implications of the\nYog\u0101c\u0101rin expression \u201cwhat appears\u201d to describe\nthe dependent nature are therefore twofold: (a) that the things that\nappear in our cognitions are exclusively the representations, which\nare the manifest forms of the subliminal impressions, and (b) that the\nentire web of conventional reality, which presents itself to our\ncognitions phenomenologically in various ways, is exclusively the\nappearance of those representations. Apart from those representations,\nconsciousnesses, which appear to be external objects, there is no\nconventionally real external content which corresponds to what\nappears.\n\nSecond, in contrast with the dependent nature which is the basis of\n\u201cwhat appears\u201d (yat khy\u0101ti), the imaginary nature\n(parikalpita), as Vasubandu defines it, is the mode of\nappearance \u201cas it appears\u201d (sau yath\u0101 khy\u0101ti) on\nthe ground that its existence is only an \u201cunreal conceptual\nfabrication\u201d (asatakalpo) ([TSN] 2, Sems tsam chi 10a).\nThe imaginary nature is only an \u201cunreal conceptual\nconstruction\u201d because of two reasons: (i) it is the dependent\nnature\u2014representations\u2014merely dually reified by the mind\nas an ultimately real subject, or self, or eg, and (ii) the imaginary\nnature is dualistic reification of beings and objects as existing\nreally and externally, there is no such reality.\n\nThird, given the fact that the dependent nature is devoid, or free\nfrom this duality, the imaginary nature is a mere superimposition on\nit. Hence nonduality, the perfect nature (parini\u1e63panna) is\nultimate reality of the dependent nature.\n",
