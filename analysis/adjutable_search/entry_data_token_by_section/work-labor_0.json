    "main_text": "Conceptual Distinctions: Work, Labor, Employment, Leisure\n1. Conceptual Distinctions: Work, Labor, Employment, Leisure\n\nIt is not difficult to enumerate examples of work. Hence, Samuel\nClark:\n\nby work I mean the familiar things we do in fields,\nfactories, offices, schools, shops, building sites, call centres,\nhomes, and so on, to make a life and a living. Examples of work in our\ncommercial society include driving a taxi, selling washing machines,\nmanaging a group of software developers, running a till in a\nsupermarket, attaching screens to smartphones on an assembly line,\nfielding customer complaints in a call centre, and teaching in a\nschool (Clark 2017: 62).\n\n\nSome contemporary commentators have observed that human life is\nincreasingly understood in work-like terms: parenthood is often\ndescribed as a job, those with romantic difficulties are invited to\n\u2018work on\u2019 their relationships, those suffering from the\ndeaths of others are advised to undertake \u2018grief work,\u2019\nand what was once exercise is now \u2018working out\u2019 (Malesic\n2017). The diversity of undertakings we designate as\n\u2018work\u2019, and the apparent dissimilarities among them, have\nled some philosophers to conclude that work resists any definition\n(Muirhead 2007: 4, Svendsen 2015) or is at best a loose concept in\nwhich different instances of work share a \u2018family\nresemblance\u2019 (Pence 2001: 96\u201397).\n\nThe porousness of the notion of work notwithstanding, some progress in\ndefining work seems possible by first considering the variety of ways\nin which work is organized. For one, although many contemporary\ndiscussions of work focus primarily on employment, not all\nwork takes the form of employment. It is therefore important not to\nassimilate work to employment, because not every philosophically\ninteresting claim that is true of employment is true of work as such,\nand vice versa. In an employment relationship, an individual worker\nsells their labor to another in exchange for compensation (usually\nmoney), with the purchaser of their labor serving as a kind of\nintermediary between the worker and those who ultimately enjoy the\ngoods that the worker helps to produce (consumers). The intermediary,\nthe employer, typically serves to manage (or appoints those\nwho manage) the hired workers \u2014 the employees\u2014, setting\nmost of the terms of what goods are thereby to be produced, how the\nprocess of production will be organized, etc. Such an arrangement is\nwhat we typically understand as having a job.\n\nBut a worker can produce goods without their production being mediated\nin this way. In some cases, a worker is a proprietor, someone\nwho owns the enterprise as well as participating in the production of\nthe goods produced by that enterprise (for example, a restaurant owner\nwho is also its head chef). This arrangement may also be termed\nself-employment, and differs from arrangements in which\nproprietors are not workers in the enterprise but merely capitalize it\nor invest in it. And some proprietors are also employers, that is,\nthey hire other workers to contribute their labor to the process of\nproduction. Arguably, entrepreneurship or self-employment, rather than\nhaving a job, has been the predominant form of work throughout human\nhistory, and it continues to be prevalent. Over half of all workers\nare self-employed in parts of the world such as Africa and South Asia,\nand the number of self-employed individuals has been rising in many\nregions of the globe (International Labor Organization 2019). In\ncontrast, jobs \u2014 more or less permanent employment relationships\n\u2014 are more a byproduct of industrial modernity than we realise\n(Suzman 2021).\n\nEmployees and proprietors are most often in a transactional\nrelationship with consumers; they produce goods that consumers buy\nusing their income. But this need not be the case. Physicians at a\n\u2018free clinic\u2019 are not paid by their patients but by a\ngovernment agency, charity, etc. Nevertheless, such employees expect\nto earn income from their work from some source. But some instances of\nwork go unpaid or uncompensated altogether. Slaves work, as do\nprisoners in some cases, but their work is often not compensated. So\ntoo for those who volunteer for charities or who provide unpaid\ncare work, attending to the needs of children, the aged, or\nthe ill.\n\nThus, work need not involve working for others, nor need it\nbe materially compensated. These observations are useful inasmuch as\nthey indicate that certain conditions we might presume to be essential\nto work (being employed, being monetarily compensated) are not in fact\nessential to it. Still, these observations only inform as to what work\nis not. Can we say more exactly what work is?\n\nPart of the difficulty in defining work is that whether a\nperson\u2019s actions constitute work seems to depend both on how her\nactions shape the world as well on the person\u2019s attitudes\nconcerning those actions. On the one hand, the activity of work is\ncausal in that it modifies the world in some non-accidental way. As\nBertrand Russell (1932) remarked, \u201cwork is of two kinds: first,\naltering the position of matter at or near the earth\u2019s surface\nrelatively to other such matter; second, telling other people to do\nso.\u201d But work involves altering the world in presumptively\nworthwhile ways. In this respect, work is closely tied to the\nproduction of what Raymond Geuss (2021:5) has called\n\u2018objective\u2019 value, value residing in\n\u201cexternal\u201d products that can be \u201cmeasured and valued\nindependently of anything one might know about the process through\nwhich that product came to be or the people who made it.\u201d By\nworking, we generate goods (material objects but also experiences,\nstates of mind, etc.) that others can value and enjoy in their own\nright. In most cases of work (for example, when employed), a person is\ncompensated not for the performance of labor as such but because their\nlabor contributes to the production of goods that have such\n\u2018objective\u2019 value. Note, however, that although work\ninvolves producing what others can enjoy or consume,\nsometimes the objective value resulting from work is not in fact\nenjoyed by others or by anyone at all. A self-sufficient farmer works\nby producing food solely for their own use, in which case the worker\n(rather than others) ends up consuming the objective value of their\nwork. Likewise, the farmer who works to produce vegetables for market\nthat ultimately go unsold has produced something whose objective value\ngoes unconsumed.\n\nGeuss has suggested a further characteristic of work, that it is\n\u201cnecessary\u201d for individuals and for \u201csocieties as a\nwhole\u201d (2021:18). Given current and historical patterns of human\nlife, work has been necessary to meet human needs. However, if some\nprognostications about automation and artificial intelligence prove\ntrue (see section 4 on \u2018The Future of Work\u2019), then the\nscarcity that has defined the human condition up to now may be\neliminated, obviating the necessity of work at both the individual and\nsocietal level. Moreover, as Geuss observes, some work aims to produce\ngoods that answer to human wants rather than human needs or\nnecessities (that is, to produce luxuries), and some individuals\nmanage to escape the necessity of work thanks to their antecedent\nwealth.\n\nStill, work appears to have as one of its essential features that it\nbe an activity that increases the objective (or perhaps\nintersubjective) value in the world. Some human activities are\ntherefore arguably not work because they generate value for the actor\ninstead of for others. For instance, work stands in contrast to\nleisure. Leisure is not simply idleness or the absence of\nwork, nor is it the absence of activity altogether (Pieper 1952,\nWalzer 1983: 184\u201387, Adorno 2001, Haney and Kline 2010). When at\nleisure, individuals engage in activities that produce goods for their\nown enjoyment largely indifferent to the objective value that these\nactivities might generate for others. The goods resulting from a\nperson\u2019s leisure are bound up with the fact that she generates\nthem through her activity. We cannot hire others to sunbathe for us or\nenjoy a musical performance for us because the value of such leisure\nactivities is contingent upon our performing the activities. Leisure\nthus produces subjective value that we \u2018make\u2019 for\nourselves, value that (unlike the objective value generated from work)\ncannot be transferred to or exchanged with others. It might also be\npossible to create the objective value associated with working despite\nbeing at leisure. A professional athlete, for instance, might be\nmotivated to play her sport as a form of leisure but produce (and be\nmonetarily compensated for the production of) objective value for\nothers (spectators who enjoy the sport). Perhaps such examples are\ninstances of work and leisure or working by way of\nleisure.\n\nSome accounts of work emphasize not the nature of the value work\nproduces but the individual\u2019s attitudes concerning work. For\ninstance, many definitions of work emphasize that work is experienced\nas exertion or strain (Budd 2011:2, Veltman 2016:24\u201325, Geuss\n2021: 9\u201313). Work, on this view, is inevitably\nlaborious. No doubt work is often strenuous. But defining\nwork in this way seems to rule out work that is sufficiently\npleasurable to the worker as to hardly feel like a burden. An actor\nmay so enjoy performing that it hardly feels like a strain at all.\nNevertheless, the performance is work inasmuch as the actor must\ndeliberately orient their activities to realize the objective value\nthe performance may have for others. Her acting will not succeed in\nproducing this objective value unless she is guided by a concern to\nproduce the value by recalling and delivering her lines, etc. In fact,\nthe actor may find performing pleasurable rather than a burden because\nshe takes great satisfaction in producing this objective value for\nothers. Other work involves little exertion of strain because it is\nnearly entirely passive; those who are paid subjects in medical\nresearch are compensated less for their active contribution to the\nresearch effort but simply \u201cto endure\u201d the investigative\nprocess and submit to the wills of others (Malmqvist 2019). Still, the\nresearch subject must also be deliberate in their participation,\nmaking sure to abide by protocols that ensure the validity of the\nresearch. Examples such as these suggest that a neglected dimension of\nwork is that, in working, we are paradigmatically guided by the wills\nof others, for we are aiming in our work activities to generate goods\nthat others could enjoy.\n",
