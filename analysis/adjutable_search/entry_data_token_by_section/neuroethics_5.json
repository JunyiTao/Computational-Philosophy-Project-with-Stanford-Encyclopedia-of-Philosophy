However, in the last decade impressive advances have been made\nin other realms of consciousness research. Most impressive have been\nthe improvements in detecting altered levels of consciousness with\nbrain imaging. Diagnosing behaviorally unresponsive patients has long\nbeen a problem for neurology, although as long as 20 years ago,\nneurologists had recognized systematic differences between and\nprognoses for a persistent vegetative state (PVS), a minimally\nconscious state (MCS), and locked-in syndrome, a syndrome in which the\npatient has normal levels of awareness but cannot move. Functional\nbrain imaging has fundamentally changed the problems faced by those\ncaring for these patients. Owen and colleagues have shown that it is\npossible to identify some patients mischaracterized as being in PVS by\ndemonstrating that they are able to understand commands and follow\ndirections (Owen, 2006). In these studies, both normal subjects and\nbrain injured patients were instructed to visualize doing two\ndifferent activities while in the fMRI scanner. In normal subjects\nthese two tasks activated different parts of cortex. Owen showed that\none patient diagnosed as in PVS showed this normal pattern, unlike\nother PVS patients, who showed no differential activation when given\nthese instructions. This data suggests that some PVS diagnosed\nsubjects can in fact process and understand the instructions, and that\nthey have the capacity for sustained attention and voluntary mental\naction. These results were later replicated in other such patients,\nand based on small cohorts, it is estimated that approximately 20% of\nPVS patients have been misdiagnosed. In a later study the same group\nused these imagination techniques to elicit from some patients with\nsevere brain injury answers to Yes/No questions (Monti et al., 2010).\nMore recent work aims to adapt these methods for EEG, a cheaper and\nmore portable neurotechnology (Bai et al., 2019). Neuroimaging\nprovides new tools for evaluating and diagnosing patients with\ndisorders of consciousness (Owen, 2013; Campbell, 2020).\n\nThese studies have the potential to revolutionize the way in which\npatients with altered states of consciousness are diagnosed and cared\nfor, may have bearing on when life support is terminated, and raise\nthe possibility of allowing patients to have some control over\nquestions regarding their care and end of life decisions (Peterson et\nal., 2020; Braddock, 2017). This last possibility, while in some ways\nalleviating some worries about how to treat severely brain-damaged\nindividuals, raises other thorny ethical problems. One of the most\npressing is how to deal with questions of competence and informed\nconsent: These are people with severe brain damage, and even when they\ndo appear capable on occasion of understanding and answering\nquestions, there are still questions about whether their abilities are\nstable, how sophisticated they are, and whether they can competently\nmake decisions about such weighty issues, as well as whether it is\nreally in their interest to remain on life support (Kahane and\nSavalescu, 2009; Fischer and Truog, 2017). Nonetheless, these methods\nopen up new possibilities for diagnosis and treatment, and for\nrestoring a measure of autonomy and self-determination to people with\nsevere brain damage.\n",
