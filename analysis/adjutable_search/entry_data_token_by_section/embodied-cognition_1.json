    "main_text": "The Foils and Inspirations for Embodied Cognition || Ecological Psychology\n1.1 Ecological Psychology\n\n\nA primary disagreement between computational and ecological\npsychologists concerns the nature of the stimuli to which organisms\nare exposed. Computationalists largely regard these stimuli as, in\nChomsky\u2019s terminology, impoverished (Chomsky 1980). The\nlinguistic utterances to which an infant comes in contact do not, on\ntheir own, contain sufficient information to indicate the grammar of a\nlanguage. Similarly, the visual information present in the light that\nstimulates an organism\u2019s retina does not, on its own, specify\nthe layout of surfaces in the organism\u2019s environment. Visual\nperception faces an \u201cinverse optics\u201d problem. For any\npattern of light on a retina, there exists an infinite number of\npossible distal surfaces capable of producing that pattern. The visual\nsystem thus seems to confront an impossible task\u2014while it is\npossible to calculate the pattern of light a reflecting surface will\nproduce on the retina, the inverse of this problem appears to be\nunsolvable, and yet visual systems solve it all the time and,\nphenomenologically speaking, immediately.\n\n\nComputationalists regard the inescapable poverty of stimuli as\nplacing on cognitive systems a need to draw inferences. Just as\nbackground knowledge allows you to infer from the footprints in the\nsnow that a deer has passed by, cognitive systems, according to\ncomputationalists, rely on sub-conscious background knowledge to infer\nwhat the world is like given the partial clues the stimuli offer. The\nperception of an object\u2019s size, for instance, would, according to\nthe computationalist, be inferred on the basis of the size of the\nretinal image of the object together with knowledge of the\nobject\u2019s distance from the viewer. Perception of an\nobject\u2019s shape, similarly, is inferred from the shape of the\nretinal image along with knowledge of the object\u2019s orientation\nrelative to the viewer.\n\n\nEcological psychologists, on the other hand, deny that organisms\nencounter impoverished stimuli (Michaels and Palatinus 2014). Such a\nview, they believe, falsely identifies whole sensory systems with\ntheir parts\u2014with eyes, or with retinal images, or with brain\nactivity. Visual perceptual processes, for instance, are not exclusive\nto the eye or even the brain, but involve the whole organism as it\nmoves about its environment. The motions of an organism create an\never-changing pattern of stimulation in which invariant features\nsurface. The detection of these invariants, according to the\necological psychologist, provides all the information necessary for\nperception. Perception of an object\u2019s shape, for instance,\nbecomes apparent as a result of detecting the kinds of transformations\nin the stimulus pattern that occur when approaching or moving around\nthe object. The edges of a square, for instance, will create patterns\nof light quite different from those that a diamond would reflect as\none moves toward or around a square, thus eliminating the need for\nrule-guided inferences, drawing upon background knowledge, to\ndistinguish the square from a diamond. Insights like these have\nencouraged embodied cognition proponents to seek explanations of\ncognition that minimize or disavow entirely the role of inference and,\nhence, the need for computation. Just as perception, according to the\necological psychologist, is an extended process involving whole\norganisms in motion through their environments, the same may well be\ntrue for many other cognitive achievements.\n",
