    "main_text": "Beyond the Black/White Binary, Beyond Double Consciousness || A \u2018Post-Continental\u2019 Turn\n5.1 A \u2018Post-Continental\u2019 Turn\n\nA distinctive application of \u2018double consciousness\u2019 comes\nout of \u2018decolonial\u2019 theory. Of and from non-dominant\ncultures and social groupings, these theorists\u2019 commitment to\nsocial struggles at the \u2018borderlands,\u2019 in geopolitically\nliminal spaces, yields arguments from doubled perspectives, both\nwithin and outside the dominant, \u2018North Atlantic\u2019 system.\nThinkers like Gloria Anzald\u00faa, Sylvia Wynter, and Walter\nMignolo, among others, came to constitute this movement, featuring\ndistinctive styles of inquiry and writing, advocating a\n\u2019decolonial turn\u2019 in humanistic research. A philosophical\nargument associated with this group, making explicit use of the notion\nof double consciousness, is Nelson Maldonado-Torres\u2019s account of\n\u2018Post-Continental Philosophy\u2019.\n\nOne guiding purpose of the de-colonial project is simply to make the\ncharge of Eurocentrism stick against the dominant modern\n\u2018Western\u2019 intellectual tradition initiated at the time of\nDescartes. Maldonado-Torres\u2019 use of double consciousness takes\nit in its original bivalent Du Boisian form \u2013 as a source of\nboth potentially deleterious illusion and of veridical insights; he\nemploys it as an interpretive strategy for critiquing the\n20th-century Continental tradition in philosophy, and\nthrough it the entire modern European tradition. He does so by\nsituating that philosophical tradition in global anti-systemic\nstruggles originating and developing in Western-hemispheric societies.\nIn this connection the term \u2018post-Continental\u2019 alludes not\nonly to the commonly accepted name of the primarily French- and\nGerman-speaking European phenomenological tradition.\n\u2018Post-Continental\u2019 also signifies its rejection of the\nprevailing \u2018geography of power,\u2019 the largely implicit\nnotion that the (European) continent is the locus of all significant\nmodern philosophical production.\n\nOf the canonical figures in that continental tradition, it is Sartre\nwho Maldonado-Torres sees as expressing the double consciousness of\nEuropean modernity, its intellectual guilty conscience. Double\nconsciousness serves as an interpretive schema for reevaluating the\nmeaning of both Sartre\u2019s overall intellectual activity as well\nas the Sartrean conception of bad faith. This is now read as an\nimplicit critique of the complicity of the intellectual culture of\nmodernity in domination, with particular reference to the colonialist\nentanglements of its dominant philosophical traditions. Developing the\npolitical argument and its philosophical critique involves arguing\nthat for Sartre, bad faith should be understood not only in an\nindividual, but also in a social, collective sense, cutting against\nits standard, individualist interpretation. \u201cFor Sartre,\nEuropean modernity is a project of bad faith\u201d (2006, 13).\n\nMaldonado-Torres distinguishes the double consciousness of the\n\u2018normative subject,\u2019 privileged member of the dominant\nsocial order, from that of the \u2018damned\u2019 \u2013 a term\ntaken from Fanon\u2019s Les Damn\u00e9s de la Terre (1961)\n(translated as The Wretched of the Earth, for which Sartre\nwrote a preface) referring to those peopling the\n\u2018underworld\u2019 at the bottom of the world-system. The double\nconsciousness of the oppressed arises in their direct experience with\nthe system in which their very being and daily existence confront them\nwith the lies and willed ignorance \u2013 the falsehoods, the\n\u2018looking away\u2019 and complicity of those who benefit \u2013\non which that system depends for its reproduction. The contradiction\nbetween the purported ideals of the oppressive system and the reality\nof their lives is, for them, starkly apparent.\n\nFor the normative subjects, however, the lie is, in a sense, within\nthem, insofar as they are complicit with the regime; their\nconfrontation with that lie demands self-scrutiny and self-critique.\nThis complicity with oppression and the lies it involves, and the\nself\u2019s confrontation with its own duplicity, can be understood\nin terms of Sartre\u2019s account of bad faith. As Maldonado-Torres\nputs it, there is within the normative subject a struggle whether to\ntake on fully the dominant culture\u2019s \u201cdemand \u2026 to\noccupy the center of the world.\u201d This demand represents a\nrequirement that the self, \u201cwith the help of an impressive\ncultural, symbolic, material, and epistemological arsenal, posits\nitself as normative,\u201d and thereby accedes to playing a part in\nthe \u201cdehumanization of Europe\u2019s racialized and colonized\npopulations.\u201d Bad faith, which, in Sartre\u2019s terms, is the\nsubject\u2019s refusal of its own freedom, a flight from\nresponsibility and into conformism, finds a political expression in\nthe dominant culture\u2019s demand for normative subjects\u2019\nconformity.\n\nBad faith is the conceptual hinge of Sartre\u2019s entire critical\nresponse to the situation of European \u2018civilization\u2019 as he\nfound it already at the inception of his philosophical career. The\nculmination of European anti-Semitism in the Holocaust and the war\nagainst fascism \u2013Maldonado-Torres calls this the \u2018crisis\nof genocidal Europe\u2019 \u2013 fueled by the active participation\nor silent complacence of much of the intellectual middle classes, was\nthe original condition for Sartre\u2019s political-philosophical\nauthorship. Sartre\u2019s engagement with the global anti-colonial\nstruggle that followed the allied victory, and particularly the\nAlgerian revolution, confirmed and focused Sartre\u2019s increasingly\npolitical opposition to the policies of the dominant European\npowers.\n\nHis engagement with the work of the Afro-Caribbean theorists\nAim\u00e9 C\u00e9saire and Frantz Fanon pushed him further, adding\nenergy to his sometimes explicitly anti-racist critical reflection.\nSartre\u2019s engagement with their thought make him, for\nMaldonado-Torres, a \u2018border subject\u2019 as well, grounded in\nthe split allegiances of a kind of \u2018double life,\u2019 itself a\nproduct of this basic rift at the heart of Europe\u2019s empire.\nMaldonado-Torres quotes a passage from Sartre\u2019s\n\u201cPreface\u201d to Fanon\u2019s The Wretched of the\nEarth, in which Sartre addresses the book\u2019s [presumably\nwhite] French reader. The quotation reads, in part:\n\n\nThis fat and pallid continent has ended up lapsing into what Fanon\nrightly calls \u2018narcissism.\u2019 Cocteau was irritated by\nParis, \u2018the city which is always thinking about itself.\u2019\nWhat else is Europe doing? Or that super-European monster, North\nAmerica? What empty chatter: liberty, equality, fraternity, love,\nhonour, country, and who knows what else? That did not prevent us from\nholding forth at the same time in racist language: filthy n***er,\nfilthy Jew, filthy North Africans. Enlightened, liberal and sensitive\nsouls \u2013 in short, neocolonialists \u2013 claimed to be shocked\nby this inconsistency; that is an error or bad faith. Nothing is more\nconsistent, among us, than racist humanism, since Europeans have only\nbeen able to make themselves human beings by creating slaves and\nmonsters.\n\n\nHere, then, through Sartre, double consciousness takes the form of\nboth a confession and a self-critique, an admission and a renunciation\nof duplicity. Maldonado-Torres\u2019s use of double consciousness as\na lens through which to read Sartre\u2019s conception of bad faith\nsharpens Sartre\u2019s account of European culture\u2019s willing\nracial ignorance, its foundational self-deception, and shows his\nambivalence toward Europe\u2019s oppressive civilizational\nhierarchies. It is what Maldonado-Torres calls Sartre\u2019s\n\u2018potentiated\u2019 double consciousness that, he claims, yields\nSartre\u2019s critical relation to the colonialist complicity of the\ncontinental tradition. Sartre\u2019s focus on the self-deceptive\naspects of the modern European tradition\u2019s intellectual\nidentity, taken as the historical work of double consciousness, both\nreveals and subverts the hypocritical complicity of the philosophical\nmainstream with the geopolitics of colonialism.\n",
