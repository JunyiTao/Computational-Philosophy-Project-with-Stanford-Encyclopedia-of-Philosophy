    "main_text": "Universals in the Via Moderna\n10. The Separation of the Viae, and the Breakdown of Scholastic Discourse in Late-Medieval Philosophy\n\nThe appeal of the simplicity of the via moderna approach,\nespecially as it was systematically articulated in the works of John\nBuridan and his students, had a tremendous impact on late-medieval\nphilosophy and theology. To be sure, many late-medieval scholars, who\nwere familiar with both ways, would have shared the sentiment\nexpressed by the remark of Domingo Soto (1494\u20131560, describing\nhimself as someone who was \u201cborn among nominalists and raised by\n realists\u201d)[56]\n to the effect that whereas the realist doctrine of the via\nantiqua was more difficult to understand, still, the nominalist\ndoctrine of the via moderna was more difficult to\n believe.[57]\n Nevertheless, the overall simplicity and internal consistency of the\nnominalist approach were undeniable, gathering a strong following by\nthe 15th century in all major universities of Europe, old\nand newly established\n alike.[58]\n\nThe resulting separation and the ensuing struggle of the medieval\nviae did not end with the victory of the one over the other.\nInstead, due to the primarily semantic nature of the\nseparation, getting the parties embroiled in increasingly complicated\nways of talking past each other, thereby generating an ever growing\ndissatisfaction, even contempt, in a new, lay, humanist\n intelligentsia,[59]\n it ended with the demise of the characteristically medieval\nconceptual frameworks of both viae in the late-medieval and\nearly modern period.\n\nThese developments, therefore, also put an end to the specifically\nmedieval problem of universals. However, the increasingly\nrarified late-medieval problem eventually vanished only to give way to\nseveral modern variants of recognizably the same\nproblem, which keeps recurring in one form or another in contemporary\nphilosophy as well. Indeed, one may safely assert that as long as\nthere is interest in the questions of how a human language obviously\nabounding in universal terms can be meaningfully mapped onto a world\nof singulars, there is a problem of universals, regardless of\nthe details of the particular conceptual framework in which the\nrelevant questions are articulated. Clearly, in this sense, the\nproblem of universals is itself a universal, the universal problem of\naccounting for the relationships between mind, language, and\nreality.\n",
