    "main_text": "Noble Cause Corruption\n3. Noble Cause Corruption\n\nAs we saw earlier, in the paradigm cases corrupt actions are a species\nof morally wrong, habitual, actions. What of the motive for corrupt\nactions? We saw above that there are many motives for corrupt actions,\nincluding desires for wealth, status, and power. However, there is\napparently at least one motive that we might think ought not to be\nassociated with corruption, namely, acting for the sake of the good.\nHere we need to be careful. For sometimes actions that are done for\nthe sake of the good are, nevertheless, morally wrong actions. Indeed,\nsome actions that are done out of a desire to achieve the good are\ncorrupt actions, namely, acts of so-called noble cause corruption.\n\nThis is not the place to provide a detailed treatment of the\nphenomenon of noble cause corruption (Kleinig 2002; Miller 2016:\nChapter 3). Rather let us simply note that even in cases of noble\ncause corruption\u2014contra what the person who performs the action\nthinks\u2014it may well be the case that the corrupt action morally\nought not to be performed; or at least the corrupt action is pro\ntanto morally wrong, even if it is morally permissible all things\nconsidered. Accordingly, the person who performs it may well be\ndeceiving him or herself, or be simply mistaken when they judge that\nthe action morally ought to be performed. So their motive, i.e., to\nact for the sake of what is right, has a moral deficiency. They are\nonly acting for the sake of what they believe is morally\nright, but in fact it is not morally right; their belief is a false\nbelief. So we can conclude that corrupt actions are habitual actions\nthat are at the very least pro tanto morally wrong and quite\npossibly morally wrong all things considered, and therefore in all\nprobability not motivated by the true belief that they are\nmorally right.\n\nHere there are more complex excuses and justifications available for\nwhat might first appear to be an act of noble cause corruption.\nPerhaps a police officer did not know that some form of evidence was\nnot admissible. The police officer\u2019s false belief that an action\nis right (putting forward the evidence in a court of law) was\nrationally dependent on some false non-moral belief (that the evidence\nwas admissible); and the police officer came to hold that non-moral\nbelief as a result of a rational process (he was informed, or at least\nmisinformed, that the evidence was admissible by a senior officer).\nThis would incline us to say that the putative act of noble cause\ncorruption was not really an act of corruption\u2014although it might\nserve to undermine a morally legitimate institutional\nprocess\u2014and therefore not an act of noble cause corruption. This\nintuition is consistent with the causal account of corruption in\nparticular. The police officer in question did perform an action that\nundermined a legitimate criminal justice process. However, his action\nwas not corrupt because he is not a corruptor. He did not intend to\nundermine the process, he did not foresee that the process would be\nundermined, and (let us assume) he could not reasonably have been\nexpected to foresee that it would be undermined. Nor is his action the\nexpression of a corrupt character.\n\nEarlier, it was suggested that acts of noble cause corruption are\npro tanto morally wrong and that this is typically contra\nwhat the actor believes. However, it is conceivable that some\nacts of noble cause corruption are morally justified all things\nconsidered. Perhaps the act of noble cause corruption while wrong\nin itself, nevertheless, was morally justified from an all\nthings considered standpoint. If so, we might conclude that the action\nwas not an act of corruption (and therefore not an act of noble cause\ncorruption). Alternatively, we might conclude that it was an act of\ncorruption, but one of those few acts of corruption that was justified\nin the circumstances. Perhaps both options are possibilities.\n\nSuppose an undercover police officer offers a \u201cbribe\u201d to a\ncorrupt judge for the purpose, supposedly, of getting the judge to\npass a lenient sentence on a known mafia crime boss. The police\nofficer is actually engaged in a so-called \u201csting\u201d\noperation as part of an anti-corruption strategy. The judge accepts\nthe bribe and is duly convicted of a criminal offence and jailed. (Let\nus also assume that the judge is already so corrupt that he will not\nbe further corrupted by being offered the bribe.) The police officer\noffers the bribe for the purpose of achieving a moral good, i.e.,\nconvicting a corrupt official. However, we are disinclined to call\nthis a case of corruption. Presumably the reason for this is that in\nthis context the \u201cbribe\u201d does not have a corrupting\neffect; in particular, it does not succeed in undermining the judicial\nprocess of sentencing the crime boss. So this is a case in which a\nprima facie act of noble cause corruption turns out not be an\nact of corruption, and therefore not an act of noble cause corruption.\nA less straightforward case is the one where the action does have a\ncorrupting effect. Consider two possibilities: (i) The sting is\ncontinued for a while (to catch other corrupt judges) and paid for (by\nbribes) verdicts are temporarily enforced during the sting; (ii) The\nprocess of considering and accepting the money offered by the\ndisguised police officer further despoils the judge\u2019s character\nbut has no further effect on court proceedings (because the judge is\narrested within minutes). In both cases, arguably, the officer\nconducting the sting operations committed an act of corruption.\n\nWhat of morally justified acts of noble cause corruption. Suppose\nsomeone bribes an immigration official in order to ensure that his\nfriend\u2014who is ineligible to enter Australia\u2014can in fact\nenter Australia, and thereby have access to life-saving hospital\ntreatment. This act of bribery is evidently an act of institutional\ncorruption; a legitimate institutional process has been subverted.\nHowever, the person acted for the sake of doing what he believed to be\nmorally right; his action was an instance of noble cause corruption.\nMoreover, from an all things considered standpoint\u2014and in\nparticular, in the light of the strength of the moral obligations owed\nto close friends when their lives are at risk\u2014his action may\nwell be morally justified. Accordingly, his act of corruption may well\nnot have a corrupting effect on himself. Plausibly, this explains any\ntendency we might have not to describe his action as an action of\ncorruption. But from the fact that the person was not corrupted it\ndoes not follow that the act did not corrupt. Moreover, it does not\neven follow that some person or other was not corrupted. Clearly, in\nour example, the immigration official was corrupted and, therefore,\nthe action was pro tanto morally wrong, even if the action\nwas morally right all things considered.\n\nIn this section the following propositions have been advanced: (a) the\nphenomenon of noble cause corruption is a species of corruption, and\nit is seen to be so by the lights of the causal account of corruption\nin particular; (b) conceivably, some acts of noble cause corruption\nare morally justified all things considered; (c) instances of\nstructural corruption favored by Lessig and/or Thompson are\npotentially cases of noble cause corruption, but this is not\nnecessarily the case.\n",
