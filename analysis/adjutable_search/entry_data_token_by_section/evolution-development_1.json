Conceptual partings and unifications of evolution and development\n\nOne of the most central topics of early philosophy of biology in the\n1960s and 1970s was the attempt to develop a suitable conceptual\nframework that would support the parting between development and\nevolution in line with the central assumption of the Modern Synthesis\nthat evolution is a change in the genetic composition of populations\nonly (Dobzhansky 1951: 16; see also Charlesworth et al. 2017). This\nmeans, as a consequence, that development does not (or not in\nsignificant ways) causally effect evolution. Over the decades this\nassumption has been supported by the historically influential\nconceptual distinction between proximate causes and ultimate causes\n(Mayr 1961).\n",
