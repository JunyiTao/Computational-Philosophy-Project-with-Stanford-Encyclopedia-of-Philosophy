    "main_text": "Liberal Concepts of Ideology\n1. Liberal Concepts of Ideology\n\n\nWhat is ideology? The term was likely coined by the French thinker\nClaude Destutt de Tracy at the turn of the nineteenth century, in his\nstudy of the Enlightenment. For De Tracy, ideology was the science of\nideas and their origins. Ideology understands ideas to issue, not\nhaphazardly from mind or consciousness, but as the result of forces in\nthe material environment that shape what people think. De Tracy\nbelieved his view of ideology could be put to progressive political\npurposes, since understanding the source of ideas might enable efforts\non behalf of human progress (see Steger 2007, 24\u201332).\n\n\nIdeology today is generally taken to mean not a science of ideas,\nbut the ideas themselves, and moreover ideas of a particular kind.\nIdeologies are ideas whose purpose is not epistemic, but political.\nThus an ideology exists to confirm a certain political viewpoint, serve\nthe interests of certain people, or to perform a functional role in\nrelation to social, economic, political and legal institutions. Daniel\nBell (1960) dubbed ideology \u2018an action-oriented system of\nbeliefs,\u2019 and the fact that ideology is action-oriented indicates\nits role is not to render reality transparent, but to motivate people\nto do or not do certain things. Such a role may involve a process of\njustification that requires the obfuscation of reality. Nonetheless,\nBell and other liberal sociologists do not assume any particular\nrelation between ideology and the status quo; some ideologies serve the\nstatus quo, others call for its reform or overthrow.\n\n\nOn this view, ideology can shape law, but a variety of ideologies\nmight be vying for legal mastery; there is no necessary connection\nbetween law and a particular ideology. Law need not be understood as\ncompromised, since law being ideological might just refer to the\ninstitutions of popular sovereignty, where public policy reflects\ncitizens\u2019 principles and beliefs; ideology would in that case just be a\nshorthand way of referring to the views of citizens that are\nlegitimately instantiated in the laws of the land. Nonetheless, Bell\nargued that a postwar consensus on capitalism and liberal democracy\nmight spell the \u2018end of ideology.\u2019\n",
