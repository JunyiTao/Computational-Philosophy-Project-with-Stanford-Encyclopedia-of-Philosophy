    "main_text": "Early Action-Based Theories || Movement and Touch in the New Theory Of Vision\n1.1 Movement and Touch in the New Theory Of Vision\n\nThere are three principal respects in which motor action is central to\nBerkeley\u2019s project in the New Theory of Vision (1709).\nFirst, Berkeley argues that visual experiences convey information\nabout three-dimensional space only to the extent that they enable\nperceivers to anticipate the tactile consequences of actions directed\nat surrounding objects. In \u00a745 of the New Theory,\nBerkeley writes:\n\n\n\u2026I say, neither distance, nor things placed at a distance are\nthemselves, or their ideas, truly perceived by sight\u2026. whoever\nwill look narrowly into his own thoughts, and examine what he means by\nsaying, he sees this or that thing at a distance, will agree with me,\nthat what he sees only suggests to his understanding, that after\nhaving passed a certain distance, to be measured by the motion of his\nbody, which is perceivable by touch, he shall come to perceive such\nand such tangible ideas which have been usually connected with such\nand such visible ideas.\n\n\nAnd later in the Treatise Concerning the Principles of Human\nKnowledge (1734: \u00a744):\n\n\n\u2026in strict truth the ideas of sight, when we apprehend by them\ndistance and things placed at a distance, do not suggest or mark out\nto us things actually existing at a distance, but only admonish us\nwhat ideas of touch will be imprinted in our minds at such and such\ndistances of time, and in consequence of such or such actions.\n\u2026[V]isible ideas are the language whereby the governing spirit\n\u2026 informs us what tangible ideas he is about to imprint upon\nus, in case we excite this or that motion in our own bodies.\n\n\nThe view Berkeley defends in these passages has recognizable\nantecedents in Locke\u2019s Essay Concerning Human\nUnderstanding (1690: Book II, Chap. 9, \u00a7\u00a78\u201310).\nThere Locke maintained that the immediate objects of sight are\n\u201cflat\u201d or lack outward depth; that sight must be\ncoordinated with touch in order to mediate judgments concerning the\ndisposition of objects in three-dimensional space; and that visible\nideas \u201cexcite\u201d in the mind movement-based ideas of\ndistance through an associative process akin to that whereby words\nsuggest their meanings: the process is \u201cperformed so constantly,\nand so quick, that we take that for the perception of our sensation,\nwhich is an idea formed by our judgment.\u201d\n\nA long line of philosophers\u2014including Condillac (1754), Reid\n(1785), Smith (1811), Mill (1842, 1843), Bain (1855, 1868), and Dewey\n(1891)\u2014accepted this view of the relation between sight and\ntouch.\n\nThe second respect in which action plays a prominent role in the\nNew Theory is teleological. Sight not only derives its\nthree-dimensional spatial significance from bodily movement, its\npurpose is to help us engage in such movement adaptively:\n\n\n\u2026the proper objects of vision constitute an universal language\nof the Author of nature, whereby we are instructed how to regulate our\nactions, in order to attain those things, that are necessary to the\npreservation and well-being of our bodies, as also to avoid whatever\nmay be hurtful and destructive of them. It is by their information\nthat we are principally guided in all the transactions and concerns of\nlife. (1709: \u00a7147)\n\n\nAlthough Berkeley does not explain how vision instructs us in\nregulating our actions, the answer is reasonably clear from the\npreceding account of depth perception: seeing an object or scene can\nelicit tangible ideas that directly motivate self-preserving action.\nThe tactual ideas associated with a rapidly looming ball in the visual\nfield, for example, can directly motivate the subject to shift\nposition defensively or to catch it before being struck. (For recent\nversions and critical assessments of the view that perception of the\nenvironment\u2019s spatial layout is systematically sensitive to the\nsubject\u2019s abilities and goals for action, see Proffitt 2006,\n2008; Bennett 2011; Firestone 2013; and Siegel 2014).\n\nThe third respect in which action is central to the New\nTheory is psychological. Tangible ideas of distance are elicited\nnot only by (1) visual or \u201cpictorial\u201d depth cues such as\nobject\u2019s degree of blurriness (objects appear increasingly\n\u201cconfused\u201d as they approach the observer), but also by\nkinaesthetic, muscular sensations resulting from (2) changes in the\nvergence angle of the eyes (1709: \u00a716) and (3) accommodation of\nthe lens (1709: \u00a727). Like many contemporary theories of spatial\nvision, the Berkeleyan account thus acknowledges an important role for\noculomotor factors in our perception of distance.\n",
