    "main_text": "Overview || Logic and Game Theory\n1.2 Logic and Game Theory\n\nIn many of the above topics, logics meets game theory. One such\ninterface area is\n epistemic game theory\n where game play and solution concepts are analyzed and justified in\nlight of various assumptions about players and their epistemic states,\nsuch as common knowledge or common belief in rationality. Epistemic\ngame theory may be viewed as a joint offspring of logic and game\ntheory, a form of progeny which constitutes a reliable sign of success\nof an interdisciplinary contact.\n\nThere are also other viable logical perspectives. In particular, one\ncan look at game theory the way mathematical logicians look at any\nbranch of mathematics. Following the style of the famous Erlangen\nProgram, one can discuss the structures studied in that field and look\nfor structural invariance relations and matching logical languages.\nGame theory is rich in structure, as it has several different natural\nnotions of invariance. The tree format of extensive games offers a\ndetailed view of what happens step by step as players make their\nmoves, whereas the matrix format of strategic form games offers a\nhigh-level view that centers on outcomes. Yet other formats, to be\ndiscussed below, focus on players\u2019 control over the various\noutcomes. All these different levels of game structure come with their\nown logical systems, as will be detailed in\n Section 2.\n Moreover, these different logics do not just provide isolated\nsnapshots: they can be related in a systematic manner.\n\nIn this way, the usual logical techniques can be brought to bear. For\ninstance, formal languages can express basic properties of games,\nwhile model-checking techniques can determine efficiently whether\nthese hold in given concrete games (cf. Clarke,\nGrumberg, & Peled 1999).\n\nExample Winning strategies.\n\nConsider the following game tree, with move relations for both\nplayers, and propositional letters \\(\\win_{i}\\) marking winning\npositions for player i.\n\n\n\nFigure 2.\n\u24d8\n\n\n\nClearly, player E has a winning strategy against player\nA, i.e., a recipe that guarantees her to win, no matter what\nA does. This is expressed by a modal formula capturing exactly\nthe right dynamics: \n\\[[\\move_A]\\langle \\move_E\\rangle \\win_E\\]\n\n\nHere \\([\\move_A]\\) is the universal modality \u201cfor all moves by\nplayer A\u201d, and \\(\\langle \\move_E\\rangle\\) is the existential\nmodality \u201cfor some move by player E\u201d. This two-step\nmodality- or quantifier-based response pattern is typical for\nstrategic powers of players in arbitrary games, as it captures the\nessence of sequential interaction. Crucially, logical laws can acquire\ngame-theoretic import. For instance, the law of Excluded Middle\napplied to the above formula yields: \n\\[{[\\move_A]\\langle \\move_E\\rangle \\win_E} \\lor {\\neg[\\move_A]\\langle \\move_E\\rangle \\win_E}\\]\n\n\nor in a logically equivalent formulation: \n\\[ {[\\move_A]\\langle \\move_E\\rangle \\win_E} \\lor {\\langle \\move_A\\rangle [\\move_E]\\neg \\win_E}\\]\n\n\nIn two-step games like the above, where exactly one player wins (i.e.,\n\\(\\win_A\\leftrightarrow\\neg\\win_E\\)), the latter formula expresses\nthat either player E or player A has a winning strategy.\nMore generally, this disjunctive assertion is a special case of\nZermelo\u2019s theorem, stating that every finite full information\ngame is determined.\n\nHaving established the connection to logical languages, further\nmodel-theoretic themes can be applied fruitfully to games. Language\nbased reasoning allows, for instance, to examine the preservation of\nproperties between different games, based on the exact syntactic shape\nof their definition. Besides, logical syntax also supports logical\nproof theory. Hence, the latter\u2019s rich pool of proof calculi may\nhelp to analyze basic results in game theory. This entry illustrates\nmajor recurring patterns of reasoning about interaction that come to\nlight in this way.\n\nGame theory also has a further natural level of representation,\nsuppressing details of local moves and choices. The most familiar\nformat for this are games in strategic form. In the simplest\ncase of only two players, these correspond to a two-dimensional\nmatrix, with rows standing for some player\u2019s strategies, and\ncolumns for the other\u2019s. Individual cells of such matrix hence\ncorrespond to the different possible strategy profiles of the\ngame. Typically, all cells are labeled with information about the\noutcomes resulting from playing the corresponding strategies\nagainst one another. This labeling specifies players\u2019 attitudes\nto outcome in terms of pay-offs, more abstract utilities, or ordinal\nmarkers for players\u2019 preferences orders among outcomes.\n\nStrategic form games, too, can model significant social scenarios.\nHere is an illustration from the philosophical literature on the\nevolution of social behavior.\n\nExample The following game in matrix form is the\nStag Hunt of Skyrms (2003),\ngoing back to ideas of David Hume. It serves as a metaphor for the\nsocial contract.\n\n\n\n\nE\n\n\n\nH\nS\n\nA\nH\n1,1 \n1,0\n\nS\n0,1 \n2,2\n\n\nEach agent must decide between pursuing their own little project,\nhunting a hare, or joining in a larger collective endeavor, hunting\nstag. The former gives a moderate but guaranteed income, no matter\nwhat others do. The collective endeavor, on the other hand, can only\nsucceed if all contribute, in which case everybody receives a high\nprofit. If, however, some do not join, all contributions are lost and\nno contributor receives anything. In the corresponding strategic form\ngame, all players have to decide on what to do in parallel, without\nknowing the actions of others.\n\nThe Stag Hunt game has two pure strategy Nash equilibria: every\ncontributes, and nobody contributes. Which of these\nstable outcomes ensues will crucially depend on the players\u2019\nreasoning, their expectations about each other, and perhaps even\nfurther information stemming, for instance, from pre-game\ncommunication.\n\nClearly, analyzing strategic games involves agentive information,\nreasoning and expectations. All these aspects have tight connections\nto logic. Viewing outcomes as possible worlds, three relevant\nrelations emerge between these. Within the matrix above, relating all\ncells in the same row fixes a unique choice already made by the row\nplayer A, while leaving E\u2019s move completely open.\nIn short, each horizontal row lists all possible choices of the column\nplayer E which A has to take into account. The\ncorresponding modality may hence be said to describe A\u2019s\nknowledge about the outcomes of the game given his choice. Still\nassuming the row player\u2019s perspective, relating cells vertically\nrather than horizontally corresponds to A\u2019s freedom of\nchoice among his available strategies. Of course, one could also\nassume player E\u2019s perspective instead, viewing the\nhorizontal direction as E\u2019s freedom of movement, while\nthe vertical directions captures her epistemic uncertainty.\n\nThus, a bimodal logic arises for matrix games with laws such as\n\n\\[{K_{E}K_{A}\\varphi} \\leftrightarrow  {K_{A}K_{E}\\varphi},\\]\n\n\ncapturing the grid structure of matrix games. For more than two\nplayers, this logic gains some additional options and subtleties to be\ndiscussed in\n Section 2.6.\n\nThe crucial third relation is that of player\u2019s preferences among\noutcomes. These, again, have matching modalities, now taken from\npreference logic (Hansson 2001). With\nthe help of some auxiliary devices, the three modalities can define\nthe central game-theoretic notion of a Nash equilibrium (Harrenstein\n2004; van der Hoek & Pauly\n2007).\n\nLogics for matrix games differ from those for extensive games, as\ngrids behave quite differently from trees in terms of complexity. Yet,\nboth fall under the same general methodology. Towards a common\nunderstanding, one might view the logic of matrix games as capturing\nthe basic laws of parallel, rather than sequential action.\n",
