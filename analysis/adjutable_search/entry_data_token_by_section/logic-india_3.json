    "main_text": "Preclassical Period || Kath\u0101-vatthu\n2.2 Kath\u0101-vatthu\n\nThe Kath\u0101-vatthu (Points of controversy) is the\nfifth of the seven canonical Abhidhamma works in the Therav\u0101da\ntradition. Unlike the Yamaka, the Kath\u0101-vatthu\nconsists of arguments. The arguments are designed to show the\ninconsistency of some two hundred propositions which are at odds with\nthe views of the Therav\u0101dins. The kind of arguments found in the\ntext is well exemplified in the following often cited passage, where\nthe Therav\u0101din questions his opponent, here a Pudgalav\u0101din,\nabout whether or not the soul is known truly and ultimately.\n\n\n\nSthavirav\u0101din:\nIs the soul known truly and ultimately? \n\nPudgalav\u0101din:\nYes. \n\nSthavirav\u0101din:\nIs the soul known truly and ultimately just like any ultimate\nfact? \n\nPudgalav\u0101din:\nNo. \n\nSthavirav\u0101din:\nAcknowledge your refutation, \n\n\u00a0\nIf the soul is known truly and ultimately, then indeed, good\nsir, you should also say that the soul is known truly and ultimately\njust like any ultimate fact. \n\n\u00a0\nWhat you say here is wrong: namely, that we ought to say (a)\nthat the soul is known truly and ultimately; but we ought not to say\n(b) that the soul is known truly and ultimately just like any ultimate\nfact. \n\n\u00a0\nIf the latter statement (b) cannot be admitted, then indeed the\nformer statement (a) should not be admitted. \n\n\u00a0\nIt is wrong to affirm the former statement (a) and to deny the\nlatter (b).  \n\n\nOne easily abstracts from this the following form,\n\n\n\nSthavirav\u0101din:\nIs A B? \n\nPudgalav\u0101din:\nYes. \n\nSthavirav\u0101din:\nIs C D? \n\nPudgalav\u0101din:\nNo. \n\nSthavirav\u0101din:\nAcknowledge your refutation, \n\n\u00a0\nIf A is B, then C is D. \n\n\u00a0\nWhat you say here is wrong: namely, that \n\n\u00a0\nA is B but that C is not D. \n\n\u00a0\nIf C is not D, then A is not B. \n\n\u00a0\nIt is wrong that A is B and C is not D.  \n\n\nIndeed, this form is repeatedly instantiated throughout Book 1,\nChapter 1.\n\nThree features of this text are important to note from the point of\nview of the history of logic. First, as the schema above shows,\narguments are put into a canonical form. While we have no record that\nsemantic ascent had taken place, there is no doubt from the arguments\nare intended to satisfy a certain form. Second, the sentences of the\nargument are logically related. The author takes for granted that the\nsentences assented to are inconsistent, corresponding to an instance\nof the following inconsistent propositional schemata of \\(\\alpha\\),\n\\(\\neg \\beta\\), \\(\\alpha \\rightarrow \\beta\\). He also takes it for\ngranted that it is wrong to hold inconsistent propositions. And he\nfinally presupposes that, if a sentence corresponding to propositional\nschema \\(\\alpha \\rightarrow \\beta\\) is true, then the sentence\ncorresponding to the propositional schema \\(\\neg \\beta \\rightarrow\n\\neg \\alpha\\) is also true; that is, he presupposes the natural\nlanguage counterpart to one direction of the equivalence of a\nconditional and its contrapositive. (See Ganeri 2001 for the most\nrecent attempt to explicate the dialectic implicit in the text.)\n",
