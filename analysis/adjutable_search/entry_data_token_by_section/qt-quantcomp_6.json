    "main_text": "Basics || Quantum Circuits\n2.3 Quantum Circuits\n\nQuantum circuits are similar to classical computer circuits in that\nthey consist of wires and logical gates. The wires\nare used to carry the information, while the gates manipulate it (note\nthat the wires are abstract and do not necessarily correspond to\nphysical wires; they may correspond to a physical particle, e.g. a\nphoton, moving from one location to another in space, or even to\ntime-evolution). Conventionally, the input of the quantum circuit is\nassumed to be a number of qubits each initialised to a computational\nbasis state (typically \\(\\lvert 0\\rangle\\)). The output state of the\ncircuit is then measured in the computational basis, or in any other\narbitrary orthonormal basis. The first quantum algorithms (i.e.\nDeutsch-Jozsa, Simon, Shor and Grover) were constructed in this\nparadigm. Additional paradigms for quantum computing exist today that\ndiffer from the quantum circuit model in many interesting ways. So\nfar, however, they all have been demonstrated to be computationally\nequivalent to the circuit model (see below), in the sense that any\ncomputational problem that can be solved by the circuit model can be\nsolved by these new models with only a polynomial overhead in\ncomputational resources. This is analogous to the fact that in\nclassical computation every \u201creasonable\u201d model can be\nefficiently simulated by any other. For discussion see Cuffaro (2018b,\n274).\n3 Quantum Algorithms\n\nAlgorithm design is a highly complicated task, and in quantum\ncomputing, delicately leveraging the features of quantum mechanics in\norder to make our algorithms more efficient makes the task even more\ncomplicated. But before discussing this aspect of quantum algorithm\ndesign, let us first convince ourselves that quantum computers can be\nharnessed to perform standard, classical, computation without any\ncomputational speed-up. In some sense this is obvious, given the\nbelief in the universal character of quantum mechanics, and the\nobservation that any quantum computation that is diagonal in the\ncomputational basis, i.e., that involves no interference between the\nqubits, is effectively classical. Yet the demonstration that quantum\ncircuits can be used to simulate classical circuits is not\nstraightforward (recall that the former are always reversible while\nthe latter use gates which are in general irreversible). Indeed,\nquantum circuits cannot be used directly to simulate\nclassical computation, but the latter can still be simulated on a\nquantum computer using an intermediate gate, namely the\nToffoli gate. This universal classical gate has three input\nbits and three output bits. Two of the input bits are control bits,\nunaffected by the action of the gate. The third input bit is a target\nbit that is flipped if both control bits are set to 1, and otherwise\nis left alone. This gate is reversible (its inverse is itself), and by\nstringing a number of such gates together one can simulate any\nclassical irreversible circuit.\n\nConsequently, using the quantum version of the Toffoli gate\n(which by definition permutes the computational basis states similarly\nto the classical Toffoli gate) one can simulate, although\nrather tediously, irreversible classical logic gates with quantum\nreversible ones. Quantum computers are thus capable of performing any\ncomputation which a classical deterministic computer can do.\n\nWhat about probabilistic computation? Not surprisingly, a quantum\ncomputer can also simulate this type of computation by using another\nfamous quantum gate, namely the Hadamard gate, a single-qubit gate\nwhich receives as input the state \\(\\lvert 0\\rangle\\) and produces the\nstate \\(\\frac{\\lvert 0\\rangle + \\lvert 1\\rangle}{\\sqrt{2}}\\).\nMeasuring this output state yields \\(\\lvert 0\\rangle\\) or \\(\\lvert\n1\\rangle\\) with 50/50 probability, which can be used to simulate a\nfair coin toss.\n\n\n      \\[\n      H = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2}}\\left[\n      \\begin{array}{cc}\n      1 & 1 \\\\\n      1 & -1\n      \\end{array}\\right]\n      \\]\n\n\n\nThe Hadamard Gate\n\n\nObviously, if quantum algorithms could be used only to simulate\nclassical algorithms, then the technological advancement in\ninformation storage and manipulation, encapsulated in\n\u201cMoore\u2019s law\u201d, would have only trivial consequences\non computational complexity theory, leaving the latter unaffected by\nthe physical world. But while some computational problems will always\nresist quantum \u201cspeed-up\u201d (in these problems the\ncomputation time depends on the input, and this feature will lead to a\nviolation of unitarity hence to an effectively classical computation\neven on a quantum computer\u2014see Myers (1997) and Linden and\nPopescu (1998)), the hope is, nonetheless, that quantum algorithms may\nnot only simulate classical ones, but that they will actually\noutperform the latter in some cases, and in so doing help to\nre-define the abstract notions of tractability and intractability and\nviolate the physical Church-Turing thesis, at least as far as\ncomputational complexity is concerned.\n",
