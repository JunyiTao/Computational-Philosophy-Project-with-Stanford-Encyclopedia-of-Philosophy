To expand the\npotential reach of the evolutionary influence model of moral judgment,\nthey typically combine that causal model with what may be called the\n\u2018mere rationalization hypothesis\u2019 with regard to the\nreasons people give for moral judgments that are really\nshaped by evolutionary factors.\n\nOn this view, our giving of reasons for our moral beliefs in\nsuch cases is interpreted as mere post hoc rationalization.\nRather than engaging in autonomous reflection and reasoning, and\ncoming to believe certain moral propositions for the reasons that\nemerge from that reflection (as with M, P and S), what is happening\ninstead according to this hypothesis is that (1) our moral beliefs are\nsimply caused by emotions or \u2018moral\ninstincts\u2019 we have largely due to our evolutionary background,\nand (2) we then invent rationalizations for these resulting\nbeliefs in order to try to make sense of them to ourselves, unaware of\ntheir real causal origins (Haidt 2001; Wheatley and Haidt 2005; Knobe\nand Leiter 2007; Leiter 2007).\n\nFor example, when someone judges that abortion is wrong, it may be\nthat \u201cthe anti-abortion judgment (a gut feeling that abortion is\nbad) causes the belief that life begins at conception (an ex post\nfacto rationalization of the gut feeling)\u201d (Haidt 2001,\n817). On this model, our moral reasonings and justifications (or at\nleast those to which the model is supposed to apply) are just so much\nwindow dressing for beliefs that are more like post-hypnotic\nsuggestions than they are like M, P or S; just as with post-hypnotic\nsuggestions, people go to great lengths to provide rationalizations in\nan attempt to render their moral beliefs intelligible to themselves.\nThe difference is that instead of a hypnotist, the causal agents are\nemotional dispositions stemming from our evolutionary past.\n\nThe basic idea that some moral beliefs are susceptible to\nthis sort of debunking explanation is not new. Moral philosophers have\nlong recognized that people have often been led to moral judgments\nbased on self-interest or prejudice, for example, and then\nrationalized their views, inventing justifications for positions held\ndue to other causes. A plausible example would be a judgment such\nas:\n\nMJ2: Interracial marriage is morally wrong.\n\n\nWhile such a judgment was not uncommon just a few generations ago,\nmost readers of this article will recognize MJ2 to be not only false,\nbut also likely to have stemmed from racial prejudice, with much of\nwhat was said to justify it being mere post hoc\nrationalization for a view more attributable to the causal influence\nof prejudice than to the workings of autonomous reflection and\nreasononing. Most philosophers today would say something similar about\na moral belief still held by many people, especially within\ntraditional religions:\n\nMJ3: Homosexuality is morally wrong.\n\n\nThe reason why philosophers tend to find a \u2018mere rationalization\nhypothesis\u2019 plausible for such beliefs as MJ2 and MJ3 is that\n(i) the justifications offered for them have consistently failed to\nstand up to critical reflection, and (ii) there are plausible\nalternative explanations for why people have really come to hold such\nbeliefs, such as that they have misconstrued personal feelings of\ndisgust as perceptions of objective moral wrongness, and projected\nthose feelings onto the world as \u2018moral\n impurity\u2019.[7]\n Together, these considerations lend support to the hypothesis that\nthe justifications offered are mere rationalizations, and that the\nbeliefs are best explained by appeal to emotional causes.\n\nThe central question is: How broadly does the deflationary model of\nthe \u2018mere rationalization hypothesis\u2019 apply to moral\njudgments, and to what extent are evolutionary influences implicated\nin those cases?\n\nAt one extreme, someone might deny that the autonomy assumption\napplies to the moral domain at all: we either lack these capacities in\nthe domain of moral thought, or at least never exercise them. Such a\nclaim seems to have little plausibility, however. Why should it be\nthat human intelligence and innovation know virtually no bounds in\nother domains\u2014as illustrated by feats of autonomous inquiry and\ncreativity in quantum field theory, algebraic topology, modal\nmetaphysics, or symphonic composition\u2014and yet when it comes to\nmoral thinking we remain stuck in ruts carved out for us by evolution,\nslavishly following patterns of thought prescribed for us by evolved,\ndomain-specific mechanisms, with all of our cultural developments\nproviding mere variations on those themes?\n\nThe very fact of human self-consciousness makes such a picture\nunlikely: for as soon as we are told that our thinking is constrained\nalong evolutionarily given paths, our very awareness of those\ninfluences provides the opening to imagine and to pursue new\npossibilities. If you are told, for example, that you are\nevolutionarily conditioned to favor your group heavily over outsiders\nin your moral judgments, you are able, as a reflective agent, to take\nthis very fact into account in your subsequent moral reflection,\ndeciding that this favoring is unwarranted and thus coming to a new,\nmore egalitarian moral\n view.[8]\n Analogously, it may be true that we possess dedicated mechanisms for\n\u2018reading\u2019 faces as trustworthy or threatening, and often\nmake split-second judgments on this basis; but this doesn\u2019t\npreclude our ability to revise such judgments, as when we reflect on\nthe behavior of someone with \u2018trustworthy facial features\u2019\nand realize that he is actually a scoundrel.\n\nIt is noteworthy that the leading proponent of the mere\nrationalization hypothesis, Jonathan Haidt (2001), does not\ntake the extreme position of denying the autonomy assumption. He\ngrants that such capacities exist and are sometimes exercised,\nsingling out the moral deliberations of philosophers as likely\nexamples (2001, 828\u201329). His claim is just that such exercise of\nautonomous reasoning in the production of moral judgment is rare; in\nthe vast majority of cases, our judgments result from immediate\n\u2018intuitions\u2019 reflecting emotional causation. But there are\nmany questions to raise even about this qualified claim (despite its\ngenerously letting philosophers, at least, off the hook).\n\nEven where our judgments are based on immediate\n\u2018intuitions\u2019, it may be that these intuitions are often\nthemselves informed by prior acts of reflection and\nreasoning (Pizarro and Bloom 2003), or are partly cognitive responses\nto objective features of situations that may outrun our ability (prior\nto philosophical reflection) to articulate them\u2014much as a chess\nmaster may \u2018see\u2019 that a certain move is best prior to\nbeing able to articulate exactly why (Kamm 1996, 2007). Similarly, the\ninput from the autonomous reasoning of philosophers and some religious\nleaders may well influence the background ethical sensibilities of\nwhole societies, thus influencing moral judgment even where there is\nno lengthy reasoning occurring in the particular case. There are also\nimportant philosophical worries about the methodologies by which Haidt\ncomes to his deflationary conclusions about the role played by\nreasoning in ordinary people\u2019s moral judgments.\n\nTo take just one example, Haidt cites a study where people made\nnegative moral judgments in response to \u201cactions that were\noffensive yet harmless, such as\u2026cleaning one\u2019s toilet with\nthe national flag.\u201d People had negative emotional reactions to\nthese things and judged them to be wrong, despite the fact that they\ndid not cause any harms to anyone; that is, \u201caffective reactions\nwere good predictors of judgment, whereas perceptions of harmfulness\nwere not\u201d (Haidt 2001, 817). He takes this to support the\nconclusion that people\u2019s moral judgments in these cases are based\non gut feelings and merely rationalized, since the actions, being\nharmless, don\u2019t actually warrant such negative moral judgments.\nBut such a conclusion would be supported only if all the subjects in\nthe experiment were consequentialists, specifically believing\nthat only harmful consequences are relevant to moral\nwrongness. If they are not, and believe\u2014perhaps quite rightly\n(though it doesn\u2019t matter for the present point what the truth is\nhere)\u2014that there are other factors that can make an\naction wrong, then their judgments may be perfectly appropriate\ndespite the lack of harmful consequences.\n\nThis is in fact entirely plausible in the cases studied: most people\nthink that it is inherently disrespectful, and hence wrong,\nto clean a toilet with their nation\u2019s flag, quite apart from the\nfact that it doesn\u2019t hurt anyone; so the fact that their moral\njudgment lines up with their emotions but not with a belief that there\nwill be harmful consequences does not show (or even suggest) that the\nmoral judgment is merely caused by emotions or gut reactions. Nor is\nit surprising that people have trouble articulating their reasons when\nthey find an action intrinsically inappropriate, as by being\ndisrespectful (as opposed to being instrumentally bad, which is much\neasier to explain).\n\nTo return to our central question: it remains unclear just how much of\nhuman moral judgment is susceptible to the mere rationalization\nhypothesis, or when it is, how much of a role is played by\nevolutionary influences on emotions. The mere rationalization\nhypothesis is best supported when we have independent reason to reject\nan appeal to autonomous reflection, as when a moral judgment is\nimplausible in itself and we have a very likely debunking causal\nexplanation of why someone might nonetheless be led to believe such a\nthing. Such is the case with MJ2 and MJ3 above, and perhaps many other\ntraditional moral judgments focused on sexual taboos, notions of\n\u2018impurity\u2019, in-group loyalty (from tribalism to\nnationalism), hierarchical authority relations, and rigid gender\nroles. But this does not provide grounds for a deflationary\napproach across the board.\n\nMany moral beliefs\u2014for example, concerning the moral irrelevance\nof sexual preference, the moral equality of persons of all races and\nnationalities, or moral obligations even to future generations in far\naway countries\u2014are much more plausible candidates for being\nupshots of autonomous moral reflection and reasoning. Indeed, many\nphilosophers take them to be plausible candidates for moral\ntruths, grasped through reflection that reveals good\nreasons for believing them, which is therefore what explains our\nmoral beliefs and behavior in these cases.\n\nThese claims may, of course, be disputed. Even if it is granted that\nour judgments are often the products of our reasoning, pace\nHaidt (2001), it remains possible that our reasoning itself is\ndistorted by evolutionary influences. This may be especially worrisome\ngiven the role played by intuitions in moral reasoning\n(unlike with mathematical reasoning, say), even in determining our\nacceptance of premises in arguments: insofar as there are concerns\nthat our intuitions may be distorted by evolutionary influences, there\nwill equally be worries about our moral reasoning (Sinnott-Armstrong\n2005).\n\nIt remains unclear, however, just how far such worries really extend,\neven if it is granted that moral intuition and reasoning are often\nsubject to such distorting influence. It is hard to see, for example,\nhow some people\u2019s moral belief that we should impoverish ourselves\nand limit our own reproduction in order to help distant strangers, or\neven that we should cease having children altogether, could be\nexplained in terms of the distortion of their reasoning by\nevolutionary influences. The striking range of moral beliefs itself,\nboth across and within cultures, seems like good evidence of\nsignificant input from autonomous moral reflection\u2014moral thought\ngoing beyond exercises of evolved \u201cneurocomputational\nsystems\u201d or \u201csocial contract algorithms\u201d or\n\u201cinference engines\u201d with domain-specific goals and special\ninference procedures designed for solving particular adaptive problems\n(Cosmides and Tooby 2008). Even if there are indeed such special\nmodules devoted to reasoning about obligation and entitlement, as\nposited by evolutionary psychologists, the question is how much they\nexplain, and whether they really exclude significant input from\nautonomous moral reasoning.\n\nThese issues remain challenging and controversial. But the\ncontroversies are as much ongoing philosophical ones as\nscientific ones, and it is therefore unlikely that scientific results\nwill settle them. Science will plainly not settle, for example,\nwhether or not there are moral truths; and if there are, they will\nlikely play an explanatory role with regard to at least some of our\nmoral beliefs\u2014something we will miss if we approach these issues\nfrom an exclusively scientific point of view.\n\nA duly cautious claim about the explanatory role of evolution with\nrespect to morality in the empirical sense might therefore be:\n\nThe Modest Evolutionary Explanatory Thesis: evolutionary\nforces may adequately explain certain capacities and\ntendencies associated with moral thinking, feeling and\nbehavior, and may explain or partially explain some\nof the content of our moral thought, feeling and behavior,\ninsofar as it is influenced (individually or via influences on\ncultural development) by those tendencies.\n\n3. Evolutionary Biology and Normative Ethics: Prescriptive Evolutionary Ethics, Corrective Evolutionary Ethics, and the Question of Moral Progress\n\nIn section 1.2, we distinguished between the empirical and normative\nsenses of \u2018morality\u2019. This section deals with morality\nin the normative sense. Does evolutionary biology shed light on\nthe content of morality in the normative sense? That is, in thinking\nabout how we ought to live, do we get any insight from evolutionary\ntheory? And does evolutionary biology have any significant\nimplications for thinking about the prospects for moral progress?\n3.1 Spencer\n\nThe project of attempting to derive normative conclusions from the\nfacts of evolutionary biology is most commonly associated with Herbert\nSpencer and his \u201cSocial Darwinist\u201d admirers. Spencer was,\nby all accounts, a more gifted and subtle thinker than he is typically\ngiven credit for today. (See the entry on\n Spencer.)\n Still, we may treat his views briefly here, as his arguments\nconcerning evolutionary biology and ethics were based on deep\nmisunderstandings of evolution. This is not to deny the historical\ninterest of his views. It may be surprising to learn, for example,\nthat Spencer himself gave a central place to harmony and mutual\naid in the \u201cpermanently peaceful societies\u201d he viewed\nas the pinnacle of evolution in its \u201chighest\nphase\u201d\u2014something one does not typically associate with\n\u201cSocial Darwinism\u201d, but which comes directly from\nSpencer\u2019s (largely non-Darwinian) conception of evolution.\n\nSpencer (1879) conceived of evolution as a teleological process,\ndirected toward the production of progressively \u201cmore\nevolved\u201d (in the sense of \u201csuperior\u201d) forms\nmanifesting a greater \u201ctotality of life\u201d, i.e., a greater\nrichness of thought, feeling and action, as well as greater length of\nlife. Human behavior is \u201cmore evolved\u201d than the behavior\nof other animals, and the harmonious and mutually supportive behavior\nof people in \u201cpermanently peaceful societies\u201d (where\n\u201cself-maintenance and race-maintenance\u201d is pursued without\nhindering others in the same pursuit) is \u201cmore evolved\u201d\nthan the behavior of savages or of members of less harmonious\nsocieties; that is, the former is the \u201chighest form of\nconduct\u201d because it subserves the greatest \u201ctotality of\nlife\u201d embodied by harmonious and happy human social life, where\nthe latter is taken to be the final end of evolution.\n\nAll of this, of course, is inconsistent with Darwinism, which denies\nthat evolution is a teleological or end-directed process, gives no\nmeaning to Spencer\u2019s notions of \u201cmore evolved\u201d forms\nor conduct (whereby human beings, for example, are \u201cmore\nevolved\u201d than other species, or ethical conduct is \u201cmore\nevolved\u201d than unethical conduct), and focuses on reproductive\nfitness rather than on Spencer\u2019s notion of the \u201cgreatest\ntotality of life in self, in offspring and in fellow man,\u201d among\nother fundamental differences (Rachels 1990). Spencer\u2019s views on\nmorality and evolution may therefore be set aside as historically\ninteresting but unhelpful to contemporary discussions based on a\nbetter understanding of evolutionary biology.\n3.2 Biology and the Autonomy of Ethics\n\nEven philosophers sympathetic to\n ethical naturalism\n (the view that moral facts are themselves natural facts of some sort)\nhave typically been wary of attempts to derive conclusions about\nmorality in the normative sense from facts about evolutionary\nhistory. This is especially so when they are clear (unlike Spencer)\nabout the principles governing Darwinian evolution through natural\nselection. From the fact that a certain trait is an adaptation, which\nevolved through natural selection by virtue of its positive feedback\neffects on germ-line replication of the alleles that generate the\ntrait, nothing at all seems to follow about whether it is morally good\nor right, or something we ought to embrace and foster. Certain\ndispositions may be present in us for good evolutionary reasons\nwithout any implication that these traits benefit us, or are moral\nvirtues or produce behaviors that are morally right.\n\nA brief survey of some of the traits that are likely biological\nadaptations in a number of species\u2014such as a tendency to kill\n\u2018step-children\u2019 or to philander\u2014ought to convince us\nthat even if similar tendencies are likewise adaptations in human\nbeings, present in us for similar evolutionary reasons, this would be\nno argument at all that we ought to engage in such behaviors.\nClearly the burden would be on the prescriptive evolutionary ethicist\nto explain why a trait\u2019s having been good at propagating the\nalleles coding for it tens or hundreds of thousands of years ago\nshould be thought to have anything at all with the rational or\nmoral justification of our embracing it. And the\nprospects for meeting this burden have never seemed strong: it is hard\nto see how such evolutionary facts can possibly have normative\nauthority or force for a rational agent (McDowell 1995).\nRegardless of why one has a given trait, the question for a rational\nagent is always: is it right for me to exercise it, or should I\ninstead renounce and resist it as far as I am able? (Korsgaard\n 2006).[9]\n\nThis suggests that ethics, like mathematics, is an autonomous\nsubject in the sense that it has its own \u201cinternal standards of\njustification and criticism\u201d, such that its conclusions cannot\nbe justified by other forms of inquiry such as evolutionary biology\n(Nagel 1979, 142; McDowell 1995 and 1997a,b). Normative ethical\nconclusions are justified through first-order ethical reflection and\nargument, just as mathematical propositions are justified through\nmathematical reasoning, rather than through learning more about our\nevolutionary past or about what is happening in our brains when we\nengage in these forms of reasoning (Rachels, 1990). It would seem to\nbe as much of a mistake to try to answer ethical questions by\nexamining fMRI scans or studying our evolutionary history as it would\nbe to try to solve mathematical problems by such means (except,\nperhaps, insofar as evolutionary theory may shed light on some\npresent, morally relevant empirical facts, as discussed below).\n\nStill, some have argued that empirical psychological studies (and\nrelated evolutionary hypotheses\u2014see section 4.2) can have\nnormative ethical implications. In particular, it has recently been\nargued that scientific evidence supports consequentialist\nethical theories over deontological ones (Greene 2003, 2008, Singer\n2005). Consider a famous pair of hypothetical cases much discussed by\nmoral philosophers (Thomson 1985):\n\n\nTrolley: a runaway trolley is heading toward five people on\nthe track ahead, who cannot get out of the way; it cannot be stopped,\nbut there is a switch you could flip that would divert it onto a side\ntrack containing only one person;\n\nBridge: a runaway trolley is heading toward five people on\nthe track ahead, who cannot get out of the way; you are standing on a\nbridge over the track, and if you shove the very large person next to\nyou off the bridge and in front of the trolley, the crushing of his\nbody will stop the trolley before it reaches the five.\n\n\nMost people respond to these cases by saying that Trolley is\npermissible while Bridge is not. But what explains this difference in\nmoral response? Many philosophers have argued for deontological\nconstraints prohibiting murdering some to save others, as in Bridge;\nthey regard the case of diverting a public threat toward lesser harm,\nas in Trolley, as an exception, and offer principled reasons for doing\nso, thus justifying our treating the two cases differently (e.g.,\nThomson 1985). Greene (2008, 42\u201344) dismisses such normative\nexplanations as unconvincing and takes a very different tack,\nhighlighting another difference between Trolley and Bridge: whereas\nthe harm done in Bridge (shoving a man to his death) is \u201cup\nclose and personal\u201d, the harm done in Trolley (by flipping a\nswitch) is not. This difference corresponds to a difference in the\nstrength of emotional response, the response to \u201cpersonal\u201d\nharm being much stronger; and this in turn corresponds to a difference\nin the brain regions most active when the cases are contemplated:\nBridge tends to activate areas associated with social/emotional\nprocessing (the posterior cingulate cortex, the medial prefrontal\ncortex, and the amygdala) while Trolley produces activity in areas\nassociated with higher cognition (the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex\nand the inferior parietal lobe).\n\nGreene takes this to support the hypothesis that what accounts for\npeople\u2019s different moral responses to Trolley and Bridge (and\ncountless other cases) is simply the difference in emotional response,\nwhich in turn ties in to evolutionary explanations. Given the need in\nour evolutionary past for mechanisms to restrain interpersonal\nviolence within cooperating groups, \u201cit should come as no\nsurprise if we have innate responses to personal violence that are\npowerful but rather primitive,\u201d predating the evolution of\ncomplex reasoning and now competing with our more reasoned responses\n(Greene 2008, 43). Deontological intuitions, such as our condemnation\nof the violence in Bridge, thus represent evolved \u201calarm-like\nemotional responses\u201d which are subsequently\nrationalized rather than resulting from moral reasoning (see\nthe discussion of Haidt in section 2.5); by contrast, our responses to\nmore abstract harm such as Trolley reflect complex cognitive\nprocesses, as do consequentialist responses generally, including cases\nwhere people overcome their initial negative emotional responses (in\ncases like Bridge) and decide that the right thing to do is whatever\nproduces the best overall consequences.\n\nGreene\u2019s claim, then, is that this casts doubt on deontological\nethical theory: far from giving us good reasons to refrain from\ncertain utility maximizing acts, it merely gives expression to\nemotional relics of our evolutionary history. A rational morality will\nmove beyond such alarm-like emotions and take us, through genuine\nreasoning, in the direction of consequentialism.\n\nAs with Haidt\u2019s claims about moral judgment (section 2.5), there\nare many philosophical questions to raise about such appeals to\nexperimental data to draw philosophically loaded conclusions (Appiah\n2008, Berker 2009, Dancy 2014, Railton 2014, FitzPatrick 2018). It is\nhardly surprising, after all, that people have strong emotional\nreactions to blatant rights violations such as shoving an innocent\nperson off a bridge in front of a trolley to be crushed for the\ngreater good. Such emotions would equally be expected on deontological\nmodels. Nor does the speed with which we make negative moral judgments\nin such cases show that the judgments are merely emotion-driven: even\nif there is not explicit reasoning going on in each case, the\nemotion-laden intuitive responses may be informed by background moral\nreflection and formation (Pizarro and Bloom 2003, Dancy 2014, Railton\n2014). Philosophers who are less skeptical of the normative\nexplanations for our judgments will find it plausible that such\nreflection has made us intuitively sensitive to morally relevant\ndistinctions\u2014such as the distinction between doing something to\na public threat to direct it toward least harm vs. assaulting an\ninnocent person and using his harm to bring about less overall harm;\nthat sensitivity then shows up in our intuitive moral judgments, which\nare no less justified just because they provoke strong emotions.\n\nIndeed, philosophers who believe there are good reasons for\ndistinguishing morally between Trolley and Bridge are unlikely to be\nconvinced by the above debunking explanation, for the following\nreason. Suppose we vary Bridge to equalize the cases for the factor\nGreene emphasizes: instead of having to shove the man off the bridge,\nall you have to do in Bridge Lever is flip a switch, and the switch\nwill activate a lever that knocks the bystander off the bridge in\nfront of the trolley. These cases are now equalized to be\n\u201cimpersonal\u201d: neither now involves violence that is\n\u201cup close and personal\u201d. But does this variation change\nour moral response? If it does not, and we find Bridge Lever again\nobjectionable (just like Bridge) while allowing for Trolley, then\nGreene\u2019s proposed explanation would not work: we would need a\ndifferent explanation for this pair of cases, such as the\nreason-giving explanation deontological philosophers would give. Even\nwith regard to the original pair of cases, while Greene may be right\nthat evolved dispositions against personal violence play some\nrole in explaining our reactions, this needn\u2019t be the whole\nexplanation. It may be that this is another case of\noverdetermination (see section 2.4).\n3.3 Corrective Uses of Evolutionary Biology in Normative Ethics\n\nA less problematic kind of appeal to evolutionary theory has been made\neven by those who fully recognize the autonomy of ethics and the role\nof autonomous moral reflection. Darwinian evolutionary theory implies\nthat many other beliefs about the natures and origins of living things\nare false. Human beings are not members of a species created by a\nspecial act of a divine designer, but members of an evolved species\nrelated by common ancestry to every other species on Earth. So insofar\nas certain ethical views rely on assumptions about special\ncreation, they will be refuted by the success of evolutionary theory.\nMore weakly, insofar as certain ethical views have traditionally been\nsupported by claims about special creation, they will to that\nextent lose some of their support. This would not show that they are\nfalse or even unjustified, as there may be alternative sufficient\nsupport for them. But in removing some of their common support,\nevolutionary theory would pose a significant challenge to those who\nhad relied on that support (Rachels 1990).\n\nRachels takes such an approach against the common belief that human\nbeings have a special moral dignity that is much higher than the\nstatus enjoyed by non-human animals. Such a belief has traditionally\nbeen rooted in the idea that we are separate from other living things,\nhaving been created specially in the image of God and endowed with\nsouls, giving us a special moral status. If evolutionary theory is\ntrue, however, then this support is undermined: since Homo\nsapiens evolved from other species, there is no sharp biological\nseparation between Homo sapiens and the rest of the living\nworld; there is instead a continuum through evolutionary history, with\nno species created separately, in a divine image, or infused with\nspecial souls. Thus, those who have based their beliefs about the\nspeical moral status of human beings on a creationist picture have a\nproblem: that picture is false, and the true picture does nothing to\nsupport such a view.\n\nAgain, however, this does not show that the common view of special\nhuman dignity is false or even unjustified. There may be other forms\nof support for it that do not depend on creationist assumptions. Many\nwould argue, for example, that although we are related to other\nanimals, we are very different from even our closest primate\nrelatives, as (not to put too fine a point on it) a trip to the zoo\nfollowed by a visit to the Library of Congress or the Metropolitan\nMuseum of Art will confirm. The vastness of the differences between\nhuman and other forms of life on Earth is not erased by pointing out\nthat human beings got to be the way we are through contingent\nevolutionary processes acting on brains similar to those of extant\napes, together with thousands of years of cultural evolution. It is\nthese real differences\u2014regardless of how they came\nabout\u2014that plausibly ground differences in the moral status of\nhuman beings and other\n animals.[10]\n\nThere are more straightforward ways in which evolutionary biology, as\nwell as results from empirical moral psychology, can play a corrective\nrole in normative ethics. Evolutionary biology and comparative\ngenetics might, for example, be used to undermine false claims about\nrace, which underlie racist ethical claims. Experimental psychology\nmight be used to cast doubts on the moral condemnation of\nhomosexuality by supporting the debunking hypothesis that such\njudgments stem from projected disgust. More generally, psychological\nexperiments can expose typical human pitfalls in moral judgment and\nbehavior\u2014tendencies toward cruelty in conditions of power\ninequality, or toward exaggerated moral condemnation when experiencing\ndisgust or stress. If we understand these facts about ourselves, we\ncan more effectively pursue and realize normative goals such as\nnon-violence or fairness by avoiding circumstances that lead to\ncruelty, or by watching for and correcting distorting influences on\nour judgment (Glover 2000; Appiah 2008, 49, 71\u201372, 110\u201311,\n124; Buchanan and Powell 2018). As noted earlier, however, the\nnormative goals themselves will not have been set for us by\nevolutionary biology or psychology. That task falls to informed moral\nreflection.\n3.4 The Question of Moral Progress\n\nThe idea of moral progress features prominently in reflection on the\nhistory and future of moral thought and practice. While it may be\ndifficult to assess whether a society has made moral progress on\nthe whole over some period, it is not hard to find plausible\nexamples of progress along particular dimensions. The elimination of\nthe Atlantic slave trade, for example, and the development of the\nmodern human rights movement are compelling examples of widespread\nmoral progress. There are also plausible avenues to further\nprogress through improved conformity with legitimate moral norms\nand through improvements in moral concepts, reasoning, and\nunderstanding. We might then wonder: what are the drivers of such\nmoral progress (and likewise of moral regression when it occurs)? And\nhow might evolutionary biology bear on the prospects and strategies\nfor achieving moral progress (and avoiding moral regression)? Allen\nBuchanan and Russell Powell take up these issues in wide-ranging\ntheoretical work that potentially has practical implications for a\nnumber of current social and political problems, as discussed below\n(Buchanan and Powell 2018, 2019; Buchanan 2020; see also the symposium\ndiscussion of the 2018 book in Analyse & Kritik 41(2),\n2019).\n\nDifferent metaethical stances (see section 4) yield different\nunderstandings of what moral progress might consist in as well as\ndifferent explanations for how moral progress has historically come\nabout. A moral realist, for example, will tend to conceive of moral\nprogress in terms of achieving a more accurate grasp of objective\nmoral truths and refining of our practices and institutions to align\nmore closely with them; and plausible examples, such as the widespread\nliberalization of moral practices over the past few centuries, will be\nexplained largely by appeal to growing insight into moral truth\n(Huemer 2016). By contrast, those who reject such appeals to objective\nmoral truths but wish to retain some notion of moral progress (perhaps\none that is extensionally very similar) will formulate a different\nconception of progress and offer socio-cultural explanations of\nprogressive changes that do not rely on appeals to improved insights\ninto moral truth (Kitcher 2011). We will here set aside the many\ncomplex issues attending these different approaches and focus on\nthis question: what bearing might our evolutionary past have on our\nprospects and strategies for achieving the sorts of changes most agree\nwould constitute moral progress?\n\nSuppose that the trend toward greater inclusivity with respect to the\nscope of moral consideration\u2014i.e., the elimination of racial and\ngender barriers to the attribution of full human moral status, and the\nextension of substantial moral considerability to a wide range of\nnon-human animals\u2014counts as moral progress. One pessimistic\nthought that might arise here on the basis of evolutionary\nconsiderations is that human moral psychology may have evolved in such\na way as to place inevitable constraints on the possibilities for\nachieving robust and sustained progress in these respects. While our\nevolved moral psychology may contain certain altruistic elements,\nthese may be ultimately parochial, given the nature of the selection\npressures faced by our Pleistocene ancestors and assuming, as most\ndiscussions do, that the long Pleistocene Epoch (roughly 2.6 million\nyears ago to 11,700 years ago, is the one primarily relevant to the\nbiological evolution of human psychological\n traits).[11]\n That is, these elements may be focused on kin and members of a\nperceived in-group, with other countervailing dispositions posing\nstrong obstacles to extending that altruism to outside groups. Even if\nwe have some capacity for autonomous moral thought, enabling at least\nsome to grasp more inclusive moral truths, there may be such powerful\nevolutionary constraints built into human moral psychology that such\nideas are unlikely to take hold and motivate progressive changes in a\nwidespread and sustainable way. There may be evolutionary limits to\nthe basic moral progress that we evolved primates can realistically\nhope to achieve: we may just be saddled with a largely\nexclusivist, tribalist morality.\n\nBuchanan and Powell refer to this pessimistic idea as\n\u201cevoconservatism,\u201d and they note that it has been used\nto argue against social and political movements organized around such\n\u201ccosmopolitan moral reform.\u201d And on the other side of\nthat same evolutionary coin, \u201cevoliberals\u201d share the same\npremise about the constraints imposed by evolution on human moral\npsychology but instead argue that since the progressive goals are\nsufficiently desirable, we should look for biotechnological\ninterventions to alter human nature in such a way as to make them\nrealistically achievable. Buchanan and Powell reject both views\nbecause they reject the underlying picture of evolved human moral\nnature. Instead, they argue that the striking shifts that have already\noccurred toward more inclusive morality, as well as consideration of\nthe conditions under which moral regression has occurred, support a\nvery different, more nuanced picture of evolved human moral\npsychology\u2014one without such pessimistic implications for deep\nand lasting moral progress.\n\nOn their \u201cbiocultural\u201d view, it is not just that human\nrationality allows significant scope for autonomous moral reasoning\nthat can lead to greater inclusivity (as discussed in section 2.4\nabove), but that our evolved moral psychology itself contains the\nseeds for such a shift (though it equally contains the seeds for\npotential moral regression). They key idea is that our evolved moral\nnature is neither inherently tribalist nor inherently inclusivist, but\ncontains both dispositions; their expression, however,\nis conditional on the particular socio-institutional environmental\nconditions that obtain (or are at least perceived to obtain). In some\nconditions tribalistic dispositions will be engaged, while in other\nconditions inclusivist dispositions can dominate. This is their\n\u201cadaptive plasticity\u201d model of evolved human moral\npsychology, according to which evolution has disposed us to think and\nbehave in certain ways under one set of (perceived) conditions, and in\nvery different ways under another set of (perceived)\nconditions\u2014this having been fitness-enhancing in our\nevolutionary history. In particular, our tribalist tendencies are\nactivated when \u201ccues of out-group threat\u201d are perceived\n(whether real or not), involving competition, disease, undermining of\nin-group cohesion, and so on; by contrast, our inclusivist tendencies\nare activated when such cues are less abundant or salient.\n\nThe hypothesis is that these adaptively plastic traits served the\nbiological interests of Pleiostocene humans well, achieving the joint\nbenefits of tribalism under conditions where it was fitness-enhancing\nand more inclusive morality under conditions where tribalism was\ncounterproductive and greater inclusivity was beneficial. For us\ntoday, this constitutes a mixed inheritance: on the one hand, it\nprovides us with the seeds for moral progress insofar as we can foster\nand maintain the socio-institutional contexts that allow more\ninclusive dispositions to flourish; on the other hand, it saddles us\nwith vulnerability to destructive tribalism when we find ourselves (or\neven just perceive ourselves to be) in circumstances\ncharacterized by sufficient out-group threat cues. Buchanan and Powell\nargue that this makes human beings dangerously susceptible to moral\nregression due to the manipulation of perceptions through demagogic\npopulism, for example\u2014a danger that is exacerbated where\ndisinformation is rapidly spread through social media. If they are\nright, then the situation is ripe for media-savvy politicians to\nmanipulate popular beliefs in ways designed to trigger the threat cues\nthat energize tribalist tendencies in thought, feeling and behavior\nfor political gain\u2014from reflexive anti-immigrant nationalist\nsentiment to racially charged scapegoating during a pandemic.\n\nWhile these dangers cast doubt on the conviction that moral\nprogress is inevitable or even the natural default, the model proposed\nby Buchanan and Powell leaves open a realistic hope for continued and\ndeepening moral progress: it is possible for humanity to make and\nsustain deep moral progress, without being hamstrung by any inbuilt\nevolutionary constraints; but it will require ongoing cultural efforts\nto foster and sustain the socio-institutional circumstances that\nenable the better aspects of human moral nature to predominate\n(Buchanan, forthcoming). This is the practical message of this\nbiocultural theory of moral progress: moral progress is possible for\nus without the need for biotechnological modifications of human\nnature; but such progress is also fragile and cannot be taken for\ngranted (Buchanan and Powell 2018).\n4. Evolutionary Metaethics\n\nWhile evolutionary facts may do little to illuminate the\ncontent of morality in the normative sense (apart from\nshedding light on morally relevant facts), they are sometimes thought\nto tell us something about the existence and nature\nof morality in the normative sense. (See section 1.2 for the notion of\nmorality in the normative sense.) A number of philosophers have\nclaimed that evolutionary theory can be used to debunk certain\nmetaethical theories and perhaps to support others. One\nrelatively modest project along these lines would be to use\nevolutionary biology to undermine Aristotelian appeals to natural\nteleology in human life to account for ethical facts, along the lines\nof Foot (2001). This evolutionary-based critique of\n\u201cteleological naturalism\u201d in ethics (FitzPatrick 2000) is\ndiscussed in the\n\nSupplement on Natural Teleology in Ethics.\n \n\nOther projects involve using evolutionary biology to try to undermine\ntraditional\n moral realism\u2014the\n view that moral judgments can be true (accurately representing moral\nfacts) when construed literally, that their truth does not depend on\nour evaluative attitudes, and that we can know at least some of these\ntruths. Such arguments are taken to support moral skepticism\n(according to which we cannot possess moral knowledge) or\n moral antirealism\n (for example, views that construe moral truths as functions of our\nevaluative attitudes, or expressivist views according to which moral\njudgments function to express attitudes, acceptance of norms, etc.,\nrather than to represent moral facts, or error theoretic views\naccording to which all moral judgments are false).\n4.1 General Evolutionary Debunking Arguments\n\nAs discussed in section 2, evolutionary accounts of the origins of our\ncapacity to be guided by moral judgments do not require any appeal to\nthe comprehension of moral truths by our hominin ancestors,\nor even to the existence of such truths. Such stories require only\nclaims about natural selection pressures having favored the\ndevelopment of such a capacity and tendency because of the positive\neffects such traits had on biological fitness (Kitcher 2006a, 176, and\n2011; Joyce 2006, 131, 184; Street 2006, 127 f.; Griffiths and Wilkins\n2015). Should this fact undermine our confidence in the existence of\nmoral truth or in the possibility of moral knowledge (at least if\nmoral truths are understood to be objective, i.e., independent of our\nevaluative attitudes)?\n\nProponents of epistemic \u2018evolutionary debunking arguments\u2019\nthink it should, arguing either that evolutionary considerations\nsupport moral skepticism (Joyce 2006, 2013, Forthcoming) or that they\nat least undermine traditional moral realism by providing a defeater\nfor our moral beliefs if correctness for moral beliefs is\nconstrued in a realist fashion as accurate representation of objective\nor independent moral truths (Street 2006, 2008). (For discussion of\nthese arguments, see Copp 2008, Kahane 2011, Enoch 2011, Skarsaune\n2011, Shafer-Landau 2012, Berker 2014, Fraser 2014, FitzPatrick\n2014a,b and 2017a,b, Vavova 2015, Rini 2016, Levi and Levi 2020, among\nmany others.)\n\nOn the face of it, the mere fact that natural selection would not have\n\u2018designed\u2019 our moral faculties to track moral truths\naccurately (as it plausibly designed our perceptual faculties to track\nfacts about medium sized objects in typical human environments) is not\nobviously problematic. There are, after all, lots of cases where we\nseem to be able to grasp genuine truths even though those truths play\nno role in the story of how our basic mental capacities evolved. We\nare able to grasp truths of quantum field theory or higher dimensional\ntopology or, for that matter, philosophy (or so we are assuming in\neven engaging in this debate) even though those truths had nothing to\ndo with why the basic mental capacities underlying these abilities\nevolved in our Pleistocene ancestors. Those capacities evolved in\nresponse to selection pressures in ancestral hunter-gatherer\nenvironments, and we have simply learned how to develop, train and\nexercise them in cultural contexts to discover truths that go far\nbeyond any that were relevant to the evolution of those underlying\ncapacities. Philosophers who endorse some form of moral realism have\ntypically believed that we\u2019ve done the same thing in grasping\nmoral truths (see sections 2.4\u20132.5).\n\nSuppose, however, that evolutionary influences not only did not design\nour faculties to track moral truths, but did positively shape\nthem in ways that have pervasively conditioned the content of\nour moral thought and feeling, through evolved emotional dispositions\nor \u201cdomain specific modules\u201d that provide us with\ninherited moral instincts that shape our beliefs. Debunkers have\nclaimed that this is the case and argued that it has deep metaethical\nimplications. Though there are a variety of formulations of such\narguments, with somewhat different targets (some attacking moral\nknowledge itself, others seeking only to undermine moral realism by\nshowing that it would saddle us with moral skepticism), a core\nargument based on the work of Sharon Street may be spelled out roughly\nlike this:\nEvolutionary Debunking Argument:\n\n\u201cOur system of evaluative judgments is thoroughly saturated with\nevolutionary influence,\u201d because of the role natural selection\nplayed in shaping our underlying psychological dispositions (Street\n2006, 114). But natural selection shaped those dispositions simply\naccording to which variations best contributed to the biological\nfitness of our hominin ancestors, rather than in ways that would be\nexpected to track independent moral truths as such, even if they\nexisted. That is, natural selection rewarded moral belief-forming\ndispositions that yielded whatever moral beliefs led to behaviors that\ncaused hunter-gatherers to out-reproduce their peers and propagate\ntheir genes more effectively, regardless of whether or not these\nbeliefs happened accurately to represent a realm of independent moral\ntruths. (The same would have been true for religious beliefs and\ntheological truths: all that mattered were the relevant effects on\ngenetic propagation, as through increased cooperation and rule\nfollowing based on belief in a watchful god, assuming the religious\nbelief-forming dispositions were under genetic control and subject to\nselection pressures. Theological truth or falsity was beside the\npoint.) But since realists do not understand moral truths simply to be\na function of what helped Pleistocene hunter-gatherers to maximize\ntheir reproductive output, it would be a sheer coincidence if\nour evolutionarily shaped moral beliefs happened to align with the\nmoral truths, accurately representing them. And we are not justified\nin thinking that any such sheer coincidence has taken place.\nTherefore, we cannot have any justified confidence that our moral\nbeliefs accurately represent independent moral truths of the sort\nposited by realists. That is, our justification for our moral beliefs\nwould be defeated by these evolutionary considerations, at least if\ntruth for moral beliefs consists in accurately representing\nindependent moral facts, as realists maintain. (Epistemic internalists\nmay deny that the facts cited above would by themselves render our\nmoral beliefs unjustified, even on a realist model. But even they\nshould agree that once we become aware of those facts our\nmoral beliefs would thereby be rendered unjustified, at least given a\nrealist model of what it would be for them to be true.) So realism\nsaddles us with skepticism. And if such skepticism is implausible,\nthen realism must be rejected in favor of an antirealist view (such as\nmoral subjectivism) that would still allow for justified moral beliefs\ndespite evolutionary influences and our awareness of them (Street\n2006, 2008).\n\nOne response to this argument, on behalf of naturalistic realism,\ngrants the claim of pervasive evolutionary influence on the contents\nof moral beliefs but challenges the claim that this should undermine\nour confidence in these beliefs. David Copp (2008), for example, has\nargued that on the conception of moral truths implied by his\nsociety-centered moral naturalism, it is plausible to suppose that a\nmoral psychology shaped by natural selection in social contexts would\nyield moral beliefs that track moral truths at least reasonably well\nas a first approximation. On such a view, moral truths are grounded in\nmoral standards having to do with codes that would enable societies to\nmeet their basic needs (continued existence, stable cooperation among\nmembers, internal harmony and peaceful relations with other\nsocieties). Given the account of the evolution of human moral\npsychology sketched in section 2.3, involving the evolution of a\ncapacity for normative guidance in connection with promoting social\nstability and cooperation (ultimately, of course, because of effects\non genetic propagation), and further contributions of cultural\nevolution toward the development of moral codes fostering those same\ngoals, many of our moral beliefs would naturally have to do with\nconditions for social stability and cooperation. Since on the proposed\nnaturalistic view this is just what moral truths are about, there\nwould thus be a tendency for our moral beliefs to have been shaped in\nways that do tend to track moral truths, especially combined with\ncontinued cultural developments for correcting beliefs or attitudes\nthat fail to contribute to these social goals.\n\nStreet (2008) has replied to this proposed way out of the problem, in\npart, by noting that Copp\u2019s strategy relies on his intuitions\nabout what the moral truths are, as reflected in his society-centered\nmoral theory. But those are precisely the intuitions of an\nevolved theorist, ex hypothesi influenced by the\nsame evolutionary factors that influenced the moral beliefs in\nquestion. So of course we can expect there to be a decent alignment\nbetween our evolutionarily shaped moral beliefs and the moral truths\ndescribed by a moral theory spun by the very same evolutionarily\nshaped mind. Such a move, she argues, therefore cannot really help the\nrealist. It would be different if God independently (and convincingly)\nrevealed to us what the moral truths are, so that we could then go\ncheck our moral beliefs against them and perhaps discover that they\nline up pretty well; but instead, all we\u2019re doing is comparing our\nmoral beliefs with a purported list of moral truths yielded by a\ntheory we find plausible precisely because it is appealing to our\nevolved sensibilities (though see Locke 2014 and FitzPatrick 2014b for\nsome complications here).\n\nSimilar and even worse worries arise for a subset of non-naturalists\nwho grant the debunkers\u2019 claims about pervasive evolutionary\ninfluence on our moral beliefs and also insist that moral properties\nand facts have played no role at any point in the formation of our\nmoral beliefs, which have instead been caused by some \u2018third\nfactor\u2019 that happens to have brought about the desired\ncorrelation (Wielenberg 2010, Enoch 2011). One can, of course, tell a\nstory about some such third factor: perhaps the \u2018evolutionary\naim\u2019, survival and reproduction, also happens to be good, so\nthat in giving us moral beliefs that promoted survival and\nreproduction evolution also happened to give us moral belief\ndispositions that are largely accurate (Enoch 2011). But the question\nis again how one is entitled to rely on moral intuitions (e.g., that\nsurvival and reproduction are good) in telling that story, even\nafter granting that those intuitions are simply the product\nof \u2018morally blind\u2019 causes, i.e., causes operating entirely\ninsensitively to moral properties and facts. There are also deeper\ndifficulties concerning oversimplifications in such accounts (e.g.,\nregarding the \u2018evolutionary aim\u2019) and the fact that on\nthis approach the correlations between moral beliefs and moral truths\nultimately rest on a mere accident, raising doubts about whether such\naccounts can really make sense of the kind of moral knowledge and\nunderstanding realists think we have (Bedke 2009, FitzPatrick\n2014b).\n\nRealists have further resources, however, which can be deployed to\nsupplement a move such as Copp\u2019s, in a way that blocks the above\ndialectical worry raised by Street. Street\u2019s objection to Copp,\nafter all, has teeth only if the realist has already granted the\nstrong claims about \u201ctremendous\u201d and pervasive\nevolutionary influence \u201csaturating\u201d our moral beliefs\nacross the board. It is far from clear, however, why realists should\naccept such strong claims to begin with. As discussed in section 2, it\nseems doubtful that the scientific evidence itself supports such\nstrong claims about the etiology of \u2018our\u2019 moral beliefs. Even\nif there is significant evolutionary influence on the content of many\nof our moral beliefs, it remains possible that many of our moral\nbeliefs are arrived at partly (or in some cases wholly) through\nautonomous moral reflection and reasoning, just as with our\nmathematical, scientific and philosophical beliefs.\n\nConsider how a moral realist will approach the above debunking\nargument. It is intended to show us that realism is untenable, which\nof course means that this conclusion cannot just be assumed\nfrom the start. Yet if we begin the argument allowing that there may\nbe independent moral truths, then why should we accept the initial\nclaim about the pervasive influence of evolutionary forces on the\ncontent of our moral thinking in the first place? If there are\nindependent moral truths, then we may plausibly have grasped many of\nthem through autonomous exercises of our capacities for moral\nreflection, whereby we have come to recognize good reasons for\nthinking certain moral propositions to be true, by correctly grasping\nthat certain features of actions are wrong-making, say.\n\nFor example, your belief that human trafficking is wrong is plausibly\nbest explained by citing your reasons for holding it: you believe\nit\u2019s wrong for the reasons you give, such as the fact that it\ncauses tremendous suffering and deprivation, violates the basic\ndignity and rights of its victims, and so on. From a realist\nperspective, these features you cite in giving your reasons for the\nbelief are in fact wrong-making features of human trafficking, i.e.,\nfeatures that make trafficking wrong and therefore make true\nthe moral proposition that human trafficking is wrong. On this\npicture, you therefore believe that trafficking is wrong because it\nis wrong and you\u2019ve come to recognize the moral fact that\nit is wrong by recognizing the reasons why it is wrong (FitzPatrick\n2016).\n\nUnless realism has already been rejected for other reasons,\nthen, this picture is an open possibility at the start of the debate,\nwhich means that the realist is entitled to hold that many of our\nmoral beliefs are in fact not merely caused by evolutionary and other\n\u2018morally blind\u2019 influences, but are instead well-grounded\nresponses to moral reality. That is, the realist need never grant the\ndebunker\u2019s strong claims to the effect that our moral beliefs\nacross the board are saturated with evolutionary influence (see\nsection 2). Perhaps some are and some aren\u2019t, and the proportions\nwill depend on the extent to which we\u2019ve successfully exercised\nautonomous reflection in arriving at our moral beliefs, which is a\nwide open question. If there are enough autonomous beliefs in the mix,\nand we can identify them, then the rest of the argument will not go\nthrough (FitzPatrick 2014a,b; 2016,\n 2017a,b).[12]\n\nThe debunking argument would be strengthened if we had good reason to\nbe skeptical about autonomous moral reflection. In this vein, Street\nclaims that whatever moral reflection and reasoning we engage in is\nlimited merely to assessing \u201cthoroughly contaminated\u201d\nevaluative beliefs using \u201ctools of rational reflection [that\nare] equally contaminated\u201d (Street 2006: 124). The problem,\nhowever, is that this claim is based upon the very premise in\nquestion: the tools of reflection are allegedly thoroughly\ncontaminated because of the \u201ctremendous\u201d\nevolutionary influence on the content of \u201cour\u201d moral\njudgments across the board; yet our question is why we should believe\nthe latter in the first place. Until we are given independent reason\nto discount the power of moral reflection so radically, treating it as\nnothing more than using some rotten apples to judge other rotten\napples, we seem to have little reason to dismiss the possibility of\nautonomous moral reflection, and therefore little reason to accept the\ninitial claim of pervasive \u201csaturation\u201d of our moral\nbeliefs with evolutionary influence.\n\nStreet actually casts her argument in terms of a \u201cDarwinian\ndilemma\u201d for realists, which centers around the following\nquestion: what is the relation between the evolutionary shaping of\nmoral judgments and the independent moral truths posited by realists?\n(Street 2006, 109). As already noted, the best scientific accounts\nsuggest that there would be no special relation here, even if such\nmoral truths existed. But if there is no special relation between this\nevolutionary shaping and independent moral truths, then we would have\nno reason to trust our moral beliefs, which are as likely to be\noff-track as on-track, leading to moral skepticism. So the realist\nseems to face a dilemma: reject the best available science or\nlose all justification for our moral beliefs.\n\nAs brought out above, one way out of the dilemma for a realist is\nsimply to deny that the evolutionary influence on the content of our\nmoral beliefs is as pervasive as Street claims. The realist can grant\nthat where such influence does exist we cannot assume that it would\nhave pushed our beliefs toward moral truth: it may accidentally have\ndone so in some cases (e.g., influencing us to think we have\nobligations to care for our children) and it might have been\ndistorting in others (e.g., influencing us to downplay obligations to\nthose who do not belong to our in-group). But this is not a problem if\nwe also have a culturally developed capacity for autonomous moral\nreflection and reasoning that allows us to attain moral knowledge\ndespite the presence of some unreliable influences. Realists\nwill claim that we don\u2019t need natural selection to have\ngiven us moral beliefs that track moral truths, any more than we need\nthis in science or philosophy: all we need is for natural selection to\nhave given us faculties that we can develop, train and use in ways\nthat reliably track moral truths, and enough freedom from\nevolutionarily given instincts that we can so exercise those\nfaculties.\n\nFinally, Street challenges the realist to specify what faculty or\ncapacity might ground our capacity to arrive at independent moral\ntruths, how the former evolved, and how the latter could plausibly\nhave arisen as a byproduct of it. She claims that there is no\nplausible story to be told here, since the capacity to grasp\nindependent moral truths would have to be \u201ca highly specialized,\nsophisticated capacity\u201d akin to the human eye, and no such\nentity could plausibly emerge \u201cas the purely incidental\nbyproduct of some unrelated capacity that was selected for on other\ngrounds entirely\u201d (Street 2006, 142\u201343). But the\nrealist\u2019s story needn\u2019t take that form. The claim will be just\nthat our capacity to grasp moral truths\u2014like our capacity to\ngrasp philosophical truths about metaphysical necessity, say\u2014is\nsimply a byproduct of our general capacities for critical reasoning,\ncombined with the evolved capacity for forming and employing normative\nconcepts in our thinking and decision-making.\n\nA related but somewhat different debunking argument focuses on the\norigins of moral concepts (Joyce 2006, chap. 6). It begins\nwith the claim that we have a complete non-moral\ngenealogy of our moral beliefs\u2014a complete explanation of how\nwe\u2019ve come to believe what we do, which does not require any\nappeal to moral truths. Instead, we explain the origins of\nour moral concepts\u2014such as fairness, justice, and guilt\u2014in\nevolutionary terms, recalling that natural selection would have\nrewarded genetic propagation, not the tracking of moral truths, in\nshaping them; and then we explain our beliefs employing those moral\nconcepts in familiar sociological and psychological terms. The claim\nis then that the existence of such a non-moral geneaology of moral\nbeliefs makes the notion of moral truths \u201cexplanatorily\nsuperfluous\u201d\u2014just as truths about witches are\nexplanatorily superfluous given a complete genealogy of beliefs about\nwitches that does not involve any appeal to truths about witches. And\nif moral truths are explanatorily superfluous, then we should not\nposit them, any more than we posit truths about witches: we should\nremain agnostic about moral truth and give up any claims to moral\nknowledge. In other words, evolutionary biology leads to moral\nskepticism.\n\nThe critical questions about this argument parallel those raised about\nthe previous one. Even if it is granted that crude versions of our\nconcepts of fairness or guilt originated through evolutionary\nprocesses in our hominin ancestors, independently of any connection to\nmoral truths, it remains possible that through cultural evolution we\nhave developed refined conceptions of fairness or guilt that\ncan be employed in epistemically respectable ways (FitzPatrick 2014a).\nRegardless of how and why the concept of fairness originated, why\nshould we doubt that we can today use a refined conception of fairness\nto state moral truths, such as the truth that race-based voting laws\nare unfair and wrong? If there are grounds of skepticism about this\nthey would have to lie in reasons to doubt the soundness of our\nfirst-order moral arguments about fairness, rather than in claims\nabout how and why a crude version of the concept first arose (Nagel\n1997).\n\nAbsent such doubts, it\u2019s not clear why the mere fact of historical\nevolutionary influence should undermine our confidence in our moral\nclaims. To draw an analogy, should a theist give up her belief just\nbecause crude, ancestral forms of religious belief can be causally\nexplained without appeal to theological facts? Perhaps she will if she\nfinds no good reasons for her own belief, and concludes that it is to\nbe explained along similar lines. But if she has reflected on the\nmatter and been persuaded by a \u201ccosmological argument from fine\ntuning,\u201d for example, then it seems she might reasonably\nmaintain her belief, taking her employment of the concept of a deity\nto be epistemically legitimate despite the fact that other employments\nare subject to debunking evolutionary, sociological and psychological\nexplanations.\n\nIn general, the worry about Joyce\u2019s debunking argument is similar\nto the worry about Street\u2019s: unless we start out already\nassuming (against the realist) that there are no knowable moral\ntruths, it is hard to see why we should accept Joyce\u2019s premise\nthat we possess a complete non-moral geneaology of\nmoral judgment, and hence that it is explanatorily superfluous to\nposit moral truths. Whether or not the non-moral geneaology is\ncomplete is precisely what is in question in ongoing metaethical\ndebates: realists, who posit knowable moral truths, can reasonably\nhold that the correct explanation for at least many of our moral\nbeliefs does appeal to moral truths or facts that we have\ngrasped, while anti-realists, who deny the existence of such truths,\nclaim that the correct explanation for all of our moral beliefs\ninvolves no such appeal. The issue remains controversial. So unless\none has independently settled that issue against realism, one is\nunlikely to accept the premise that there is a complete non-moral\ngenealogy of our moral beliefs: there may well be a partial\nnon-moral genealogy, for the sorts of reasons Joyce gives, but it will\nbe complete only if none of our moral beliefs are\nthe result of our having grasped moral truths; and this negative claim\nwill be very unlikely if there are in fact knowable moral truths\n(since we would plausibly have grasped some of them, and they would\nthus figure into the explanation of some of our moral beliefs). We\nshould therefore feel compelled to grant Joyce\u2019s premise that\nthere is such a complete non-moral genealogy only if we have\nalready given up on the idea of knowable moral truths. But\nthat makes it hard to see how the argument as a whole can be used to\npersuade anyone who doesn\u2019t already accept its conclusion.\n\nIt is worth noting that the appeal to evolution to support general\nskeptical worries about ethics is not in fact new: it goes all the\nback to Darwin himself. Consider the following provocative, fanciful\nreflection (later echoed closely by E.O. Wilson 1978, 204\u2013206),\nwhich at least suggests a skeptical argument closely related to the\ndebunking arguments examined above:\n\nIt may be well first to premise that I do not wish to maintain that\nany strictly social animal, if its intellectual faculties were to\nbecome as active and as highly developed as in man, would acquire\nexactly the same moral sense as ours. In the same manner as various\nanimals have some sense of beauty, though they admire widely different\nobjects, so they might have a sense of right and wrong, though led by\nit to follow widely different lines of conduct. If, for instance, to\ntake an extreme case, men were reared under precisely the same\nconditions as hive-bees, there can hardly be a doubt that our\nunmarried females would, like the worker-bees, think it a sacred duty\nto kill their brothers, and mothers would strive to kill their fertile\ndaughters; and no one would think of interfering. Nevertheless the\nbee, or any other social animal, would in our supposed case gain, as\nit appears to me, some feeling of right and wrong, or a conscience\n(Darwin 1871, 73).\n\n\nThe argument at least suggested by this passage is that our moral\nsense, which generates our moral beliefs, has the shape and content it\nhas because of the contingencies of human ecology; had creatures with\na very different ecology, such as bees, come to be rational, they\nwould thus have developed a very different moral sense suitable to\ntheir ecology. But then which of these very different moral senses\ncould be expected reliably to track moral truths (if they exist)? The\nanswer seems to be: neither (unless we simply relativize\nmoral truths to various possible ecologies, taking such truths to\nreduce to facts about effective genetic propagation\u2014though as we\nsaw in section 3, such a move has little moral plausibility). For\nmoral senses are contingent products of particular ecologies in a way\nthat cannot be expected to track independent and stable moral truths.\nWe and the hypothetical rational bees will thus have very different\nmoral outlooks, each of which is explicable in terms of our respective\necologies and will seem quite natural to those who occupy the relevant\necology (while the other\u2019s outlook will seem bizarre), but neither\nof which seems to have any claim to be a reliable guide to moral\ntruth (as usually conceived). This imaginary exercise in\nperspective thus seems to support moral skepticism: the very idea of\nindependent, stable moral truths will seem suspect (playing no role in\nthe explanation of the origins of various possible moral senses), and\nour confidence that our moral sense would track them in any case will\nseem unwarranted.\n\nWhat such an argument overlooks, however, is precisely the factor of\nautonomous moral reflection that the bees\u2019 imagined\nrationality would bring with it (see sections 2.4\u20132.5, and\nMcDowell 1995). True, we might expect relatively unreflective and\ntradition-bound bees to speak of \u201csacred duties\u201d to kill\nbrothers or fertile daughters, in a way that lines up with the\nrelevant genetic relations that figured into the evolution of their\ngiven moral senses. But we could equally expect more reflective bees\n(the buzzing philosophers among them) to raise the question whether\nthey really had good reason to do everything that their\nevolution has disposed them to do in the service of maximizing their\ngenetic propagation. These more philosophical bees might consider the\npossibility that some potential goods of bee life, in the context of\nongoing innovations in rational bee culture, might be available to\nthem if they resisted certain impulses and acted differently; and this\nmight lead to the development of at least partly autonomous moral\nnorms, and hence moral senses that are a complex mixture of inherited\ndispositions and rational judgment.\n\nIf bees became rational, then, there is no reason to suppose that\ntheir moral sensibilities would simply reflect their ecology any more\nthan human moral sensibilities simply reflect human ecology: to the\nextent that they are really rational, we should expect some autonomous\nreflection, and perhaps even significant overlap with autonomous human\nmoral reflection, as we both strive for something beyond the merely\nbiologically useful (FitzPatrick 2000, 355\u201356, and 2017b). This\nis not to suggest, of course, that moral truths or objective moral\nnorms, if they exist, will be exactly the same for human life and for\nrational bee life, or for actual human life and human life imagined\nunder vastly different ecological circumstances. On any plausible view\nof morality, there will be significant variation in moral principles\nand/or their applications where there is significant variation in the\nbasic facts of life. Just as we could never live just like bees, bees\ncould never live just like humans, and no reasonable morality would\ndemand such a thing. Even a realist, then, will grant a significant\ndegree of cross-species moral relativism (or counterfactual moral\nrelativism for deeply different courses of human evolution). But it\nneedn\u2019t be the extreme and implausible relativism linking true\nmoral standards simply and directly to ecology, and whatever moral\ntruths might obtain for each species might well be accessible to\nmembers of each species through autonomous moral reflection, with at\nleast some points of convergence.\n4.2 Selective Evolutionary Debunking Arguments\n\nBefore leaving the topic of evolutionary debunking arguments, it\nshould be noted that in addition to the general arguments considered\nabove, which are aimed at debunking morality (or in Street\u2019s case,\ndebunking a realist construal of morality) as a whole, there\nare also evolutionary debunking arguments meant instead just to target\na selected range of moral beliefs as epistemically suspect.\nSuch selective debunking arguments may be deployed by moral realists\nwho reject general debunking arguments in this domain but nonetheless\nwish to use similar tactics to discredit certain kinds of moral belief\nas part of advancing their own normative ethical project.\nThey might argue, for example, that while the deontological beliefs\nheld by their opponents can be successfully debunked by appeal to\nevolutionary considerations, their own utilitarian ethical beliefs are\nimmune from such debunking, stemming from autonomous rational\nreflection rather than from evolved psychological modules shaped by\nthe distorting influences of natural selection.\n\nThis is the strategy adopted by Katarzyna de Lazari-Radek and Peter\nSinger (2014) in an effort to support Sidgwick\u2019s principle of\nUniversal Benevolence, i.e., impartial utilitarianism. That principle\nis inconsistent not only with moral egoism but with any moral\nstance that incorporates limited forms of partiality (such as special\nduties to family and friends even when not utility-maximizing, or\nconstraints against taking certain means\nwhen promoting utility, or moral permissions to favor\noneself or loved ones to some degree over strangers). So in order to\ndiscredit such competing moral views, they claim that one can tell\ndebunking evolutionary stories to \u2018explain away\u2019 these\nnon-utilitarian moral beliefs as unreliable products of distorting\nevolutionary influences: people believe such things only because\nnatural selection shaped human moral psychology in the direction of\nselfishness and at best parochial altruism, for Darwinian reasons\nhaving nothing to do with moral truth. Then, in effect, they treat the\npossibility of telling such debunking evolutionary stories as\nsufficient to undermine epistemic justification for the targeted moral\nbeliefs. At the same time, however, they maintain that their own\nfavored ethical beliefs, involving strict impartiality, are\ninvulnerable to any similar treatment, so that we can remain confident\nin the rationality of utilitarian morality.\n\nThere are reasons to doubt whether this sort of theoretically\nambitious but selective evolutionary debunking strategy is a viable or\nstable one (Kahane 2011 and 2014, Rini 2016, FitzPatrick 2017a).\nA natural worry is that if such debunking arguments really worked\nagainst opponents of utilitarianism in the manner suggested, then\nsimilar arguments could equally be deployed against\nutilitarianism if we play by the same rules. The selective\ndebunking arguments used by de Lazari-Radek and Singer give a great\ndeal of negative epistemic weight to the mere existence of possible\ndebunking explanations which, if true, would clearly pose a\nproblem for the targeted beliefs (even though it remains a wide open\nquestion whether such explanatory stories are in fact true). That is,\nthey give great weight to the mere ability to tell a plausible\ndebunking story according to which non-utilitarian moral beliefs\nwould turn out to be problematically rooted in \u2018contaminated\nstarting points\u2019 (psychological dispositions resulting from\nmorally blind evolutionary forces) that have merely been refined over\ntime by culturally conditioned causal influences operating equally\nblindly to moral truths. This raises problems for them, however,\nbecause one can easiliy enough come up with similar debunking stories\nabout utilitarian beliefs, according to which they would\nequally turn out to be problematically shaped by morally-blind\nevolutionary forces that contaminated the starting points.\n\nHere is just one way such a story could go (FitzPatrick 2017a). Recall\nthe possibility discussed in sub-sections 2.2 and 2.3, that in early\nancestral environments involving mostly small in-group interactions,\nwhere there were relatively few opportunities for \u2018wasting\u2019\naltruistic tendencies on outsiders, natural selection gave rise to\nsome fairly indiscriminate dispositions involving sympathy\nand altruism. (Or again, recall the adaptive plasticity model from\nBuchanan and Powell 2018, discussed in section 3.4, which posits\nenvironmentally sensitive inclusivist tendencies as part of evolved\nhuman psychology.) As long as such indiscriminate altruism contributed\nmore to fitness in that environment than it detracted from it through\noccasional \u2018misfirings\u2019 of such sentiments and behaviors\ndirected at non-cooperators, it could very well have evolved as a\nsimple fitness-enhancing mechanism (Kitcher 2006b). Someone who wishes\nto debunk impartial utilitarianism might then tell a story according\nto which the utilitarian\u2019s impartial sympathy and concern is\nnothing but an extension of this evolved psychological trait, whereby\nit is systematically \u2018misfiring\u2019 (from a biological point of\nview) in our current environment. More precisely, the story would be\nthat current utilitarian beliefs represent a cultural refinement of\nsuch evolved tendencies via an application of reasoning, such\nas the consistency reasoning utilitarians employ in arguing for an\n\u201cexpanding circle\u201d of moral concern and an increasingly\nimpartial altruism. The debunker will claim that however rational such\ninferential steps may be in themselves, they are still just operating\non certain moral starting points that are \u2018contaminated\u2019\nby evolutionary influence: namely, deeply ingrained moral intuitions\nabout the intrinsic badness of suffering wherever it occurs,\nor the goodness of pleasure, which trace back to evolved psychological\ndispositions to recoil at suffering and injury, and to feel sympathy\nfor others. Basic utilitarian moral intuitions, no less than\nnon-utilitarian intuitions, may ultimately be nothing but illusions\nfoisted on us by our evolutionary history, rooted in contaminated\nstarting points (Ruse 2006). In both cases, proponents of the moral\nviews in question have moved well beyond the original evolved\ndispositions, through culturally-developed reasoning that has refined\nthem in various ways. But if this doesn\u2019t save non-utilitarian\nmoral beliefs given the debunking story about the contaminated\nstarting points, then it won\u2019t save utilitarian moral beliefs\neither.\n\nNow de Lazari-Radek and Singer might reasonably wish to counter such\ndebunking attacks by claiming that even if there are such evolutionary\ninfluences at the root of their intuitions about the badness of\nsuffering or the propriety of impartial altruism, the reflection and\nreasoning that has taken place over centuries of sophisticated moral\ninquiry has not merely provided for more consistent applications of\nevolutionarily contaminated dispositions: it has instead amounted to\nthe intellectual discovery of good reasons to believe the\ncontents of utilitarian moral claims to be true. This\nphilosophical possibility certainly remains on the table and\nhasn\u2019t been shown not to obtain simply because an aspiring\ndebunker can tell a debunking story according to which it doesn\u2019t.\nAnd such a reply would indeed be a plausible response to the debunker,\nmaking precisely the point emphasized earlier in section 4.1, in\nresponding to general debunking arguments. The problem, however, is\nthat if they are entitled to make this response to the debunker on\nbehalf of utilitarian moral beliefs, then so are their opponents on\nbehalf of non-utilitarian moral beliefs: what\u2019s good for the\nutilitarian goose is good for the non-utilitarian gander.\n\nIn other words, to escape evolutionary debunking themselves, it seems\nthat de Lazari-Radek and Singer will have to allow that the mere\nexistence of a possible evolutionary debunking explanation for a set\nof moral beliefs does not undermine epistemic justification for them.\nIt matters whether or not that story is actually the correct\nexplanatory story, including its claim that the beliefs in question\nare exhaustively accounted for simply in terms of the\nmorally-blind, extraneous causes in question, rather than partly\nthrough rational grasp of good reasons for believing their contents to\nbe true; and merely being able to tell a debunking story does not\nestablish such a strong claim. Once this is recognized,\nhowever, the same principle applies to just the sorts of\ndebunking arguments they have deployed against non-utilitarians, who\ncan thus avoid them in the same way.\n\nOne or more of the debunking stories could, of course, still turn out\nto be true, and they do need to be taken seriously as\npossibilities. The critical points raised here are just,\nfirst, that it is unclear whether debunking arguments really have\ncompelling force against those who haven\u2019t already\nindependently rejected the positions being targeted (showing them that\ntheir beliefs are really bunk); and second, that it may be\nhazardous for those who reject general evolutionary debunking\narguments in ethics to attempt to use similar arguments selectively\nagainst competing normative ethical views. Such potential\nexplanations could, however, still play a supporting role within a\nbroader set of moral arguments, contributing a possible theory of\nerror helping to explain why some people may believe certain moral\nclaims or theories even though they are false.\n4.3 Evolutionary Biology and Expressivism\n\nA less ambitious claim made by some antirealists is that the account\nin section 2.3 of the origins of our capacity for normative guidance\nat least lends support to or fits naturally with an\nexpressivist metaethical view\u2014the view that moral\njudgments do not even purport to state moral facts, but instead\nexpress non-cognitive states such as attitudes or acceptance of\ncertain norms, etc. (Gibbard 1990; Kitcher 2006a). Suppose the human\ncapacity for normative guidance is indeed an adaptation that evolved\nin connection with social coordination, cooperation and stability.\nThis capacity involves being in the state of accepting a\nnorm, which we should thus expect to be a standard part of human\nmoral psychology and its capacity for \u201clinguistically infused\nmotivation\u201d (Gibbard 1990, 55). This may lend support to a\nnorm-expressivist approach to normative judgment, insofar as such an\napproach focuses precisely on the notion of accepting a norm, and the\nevolutionary story provides good reason to suppose that accepting a\nnorm is a \u201cnatural, biological phenomenon\u201d (61).\n\nIt is less clear, however, whether anything stronger than this can be\nsaid. Suppose it\u2019s true that we evolved a capacity and tendency\nfor normative guidance because of the coordinating social function\nachieved by the expression of norm acceptance. Not only does this\nleave open what we now use that capacity to do, but it even\nleaves open what exactly our ancestors did with it. One possibility is\nthat the activity they were engaged with was non-cognitive:\nthey were merely expressing non-cognitive states comprising attitudes\nand states of norm acceptance. Kitcher (2006a) suggests that this is\nthe metaethical picture best supported by the evolutionary story. But\nJoyce (2006, 175\u201376) has disputed this. Even granting that the\nbiological function of moral judgment is social coordination,\nthe linguistic function of moral judgments could go either\nway: it may be that the biological function was carried out through\nnon-cognitive expressions of norm acceptance, but it may equally\ninstead be that it was carried out through cognitive\njudgments involving claims to objective validity. Indeed, the\nsocial function might be all the better served if those making moral\njudgments firmly believe in objective values and assert those beliefs,\neven if they are in fact making a projective error in doing so, as\nerror theorists claim. Compare: even if religious belief has a\nbiological function (e.g., reducing anxiety), it wouldn\u2019t follow\nthat religious assertions are non-cognitive and so aren\u2019t really\nassertions, and the story might be more plausible if it is assumed\nthat they are genuine assertions (Joyce 2006, 176, 208; Ruse\n2006).\n\nThus, although the evolutionary story fits naturally with a merely\nnon-cognitivist metaethical view, it may fit equally well with a\ncognitivist view. If one rejects the existence of moral truths, the\nlatter would then lead to an error theory (Mackie 1977). But as\ndiscussed in section 4.1, it is far from clear how much support\nevolutionary biology itself lends to moral anti-realism or irrealism.\nIt is consistent with plausible evolutionary stories that although our\ncapacities for normative guidance originally evolved for reasons that\nhad nothing to do with moral truths as such, we now regularly employ\nthem to deliberate about and to communicate moral truths. So all three\nmetaethical views discussed here\u2014expressivism, error theory and\nmoral realism\u2014remain on the table.",
