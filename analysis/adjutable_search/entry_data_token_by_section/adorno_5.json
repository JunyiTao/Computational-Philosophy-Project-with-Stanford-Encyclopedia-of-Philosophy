    "main_text": "Negative Dialectics\n6. Ethics and Metaphysics after Auschwitz\n\n\nLike Adorno's epistemology, his moral philosophy derives from a\nmaterialistic metacritique of German idealism. The model on \u201cFreedom\u201d\nin Negative Dialectics (ND 211\u201399) conducts a metacritique of\nKant's critique of practical reason. So too, the model on \u201cWorld\nSpirit and Natural History\u201d (ND 300\u201360) provides a metacritique of\nHegel's philosophy of history. Both models simultaneously carry out a\nsubterranean debate with the Marxist tradition, and this debate guides\nAdorno's appropriation of both Kantian and Hegelian \u201cpractical\nphilosophy.\u201d\n\n\nThe first section in the Introduction to Negative Dialectics\nindicates the direction Adorno's appropriation will take (ND\n3\u20134). There he asks whether and how philosophy is still\npossible. Adorno asks this against the backdrop of Karl Marx's\nTheses on Feuerbach, which famously proclaimed that\nphilosophy's task is not simply to interpret the world but to change\nit. In distinguishing his historical materialism from the sensory\nmaterialism of Ludwig Feuerbach, Marx portrays human beings as\nfundamentally productive and political organisms whose interrelations\nare not merely interpersonal but societal and historical. Marx's\nemphasis on production, politics, society, and history takes his\nepistemology in a \u201cpragmatic\u201d\ndirection. \u201cTruth\u201d does not indicate the abstract\ncorrespondence between thought and reality, between proposition and\nfact, he says. Instead, \u201ctruth\u201d refers to the economic,\npolitical, societal, and historical fruitfulness of thought in\npractice.\n\n\nAlthough Adorno shares many of Marx's anthropological intuitions, he\nthinks that a twentieth-century equation of truth with practical\nfruitfulness had disastrous effects on both sides of the iron curtain.\nThe Introduction to Negative Dialectics begins by making two\nclaims. First, although apparently obsolete, philosophy remains\nnecessary because capitalism has not been overthrown. Second, Marx's\ninterpretation of capitalist society was inadequate and his critique\nis outmoded. Hence, praxis no longer serves as an adequate basis for\nchallenging (philosophical) theory. In fact, praxis serves mostly as a\npretext for shutting down the theoretical critique that transformative\npraxis would require. Having missed the moment of its realization (via\nthe proletarian revolution, according to early Marx), philosophy today\nmust criticize itself: its societal naivete, its intellectual\nantiquation, its inability to grasp the power at work in industrial\nlate capitalism. While still pretending to grasp the whole, philosophy\nfails to recognize how thoroughly it depends upon society as a whole,\nall the way into philosophy's \u201cimmanent truth\u201d (ND\n4). Philosophy must shed such naivete. It must ask, as Kant asked\nabout metaphysics after Hume's critique of rationalism, How is\nphilosophy still possible? More specifically, How, after the collapse\nof Hegelian thought, is philosophy still possible? How can the\ndialectical effort to conceptualize the nonconceptual\u2014which Marx\nalso pursued\u2014how can this philosophy be continued?\n\n\nThis self-implicating critique of the relation between theory and\npractice is one crucial source to Adorno's reflections on ethics and\nmetaphysics. Another is the catastrophic impact of twentieth-century\nhistory on the prospects for imagining and achieving a more humane\nworld. Adorno's is an ethics and metaphysics \u201cafter Auschwitz\u201d\n(Bernstein 2001, 371\u2013414; Zuidervaart 2007, 48\u201376). Ethically, he\nsays, Hitler's barbarism imposes a \u201cnew categorical imperative\u201d on\nhuman beings in their condition of unfreedom: so to arrange their\nthought and action that \u201cAuschwitz would not repeat itself, [that]\nnothing similar would happen\u201d (ND 365). Metaphysically, philosophers\nmust find historically appropriate ways to speak about meaning and\ntruth and suffering that neither deny nor affirm the existence of a\nworld transcendent to the one we know. Whereas denying it would\nsuppress the suffering that calls out for fundamental change,\nstraightforwardly affirming the existence of utopia would cut off the\ncritique of contemporary society and the struggle to change it. The\nbasis for Adorno's double strategy is not a hidden ontology, as some\nhave suggested, but rather a \u201cspeculative\u201d or \u201cmetaphysical\u201d\nexperience. Adorno appeals to the experience that thought which \u201cdoes\nnot decapitate itself\u201d flows into the idea of a world where \u201cnot only\nextant suffering would be abolished but also suffering that is\nirrevocably past would be revoked\u201d (403). Neither logical positivist\nantimetaphysics nor Heideggerian hypermetaphysics can do justice to\nthis experience.\n\n\nAdorno indicates his own alternative to both traditional metaphysics\nand more recent antimetaphysics in passages that juxtapose resolute\nself-criticism and impassioned hope. His historiographic, social\ntheoretical, aesthetic, and negative dialectical concerns meet in\npassages such as this:\n\nThought that does not capitulate before\nwretched existence comes to nought before its criteria, truth becomes\nuntruth, philosophy becomes folly. And yet philosophy cannot give up,\nlest idiocy triumph in actualized unreason [Widervernunft]\n\u2026 Folly is truth in the shape that human beings must accept\nwhenever, amid the untrue, they do not give up truth. Even at the\nhighest peaks art is semblance; but art receives the semblance\n\u2026 from nonsemblance [vom\nScheinlosen]\u00a0\u2026\u00a0. No light falls on people and\nthings in which transcendence would not appear\n[widerschiene]. Indelible in resistance to the fungible world\nof exchange is the resistance of the eye that does not want the\nworld's colors to vanish. In semblance nonsemblance is promised (ND\n404\u20135). \nAddressing such passages is crucial in the ongoing assessment of\nAdorno's philosophy.\n",
