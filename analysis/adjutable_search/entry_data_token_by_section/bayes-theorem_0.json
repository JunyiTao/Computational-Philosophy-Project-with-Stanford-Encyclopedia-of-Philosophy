Conditional Probabilities and Bayes' Theorem\n\n The probability of a hypothesis H conditional on a given\nbody of data E is the ratio of the unconditional probability\nof the conjunction of the hypothesis with the data to the\nunconditional probability of the data alone.\n\n\n\n(1.1)\u00a0\nDefinition.\n\n\n\nThe probability of H conditional on E is\ndefined as PE(H) =\nP(H & E)/P(E),\nprovided that both terms of this ratio exist and P(E)\n >  \n 0.[1]\n\n\n\n\n To illustrate, suppose J. Doe is a randomly chosen American who was alive\non January 1, 2000.  According to the United States Center for Disease\nControl, roughly 2.4 million of the 275 million Americans alive on that\ndate died during the 2000 calendar year.  Among the approximately 16.6\nmillion senior citizens (age 75 or greater) about 1.36 million died.  The\nunconditional probability of the hypothesis that our J. Doe died during\n2000, H, is just the population-wide mortality rate\nP(H) = 2.4M/275M = 0.00873.  To find the probability\nof J.  Doe's death conditional on the information, E, that he\nor she was a senior citizen, we divide the probability that he or she was\na senior who died, P(H & E) \n= 1.36M/275M = 0.00495, by the probability that he or she was a senior citizen, \nP(E) = 16.6M/275M = 0.06036.  Thus, the probability of J. Doe's \ndeath given that he or she was a senior is\nPE(H) = P(H &\nE)/P(E) = 0.00495/0.06036 = 0.082.  Notice how the\nsize of the total population factors out of this equation, so that\nPE(H) is just the proportion of seniors\nwho died.  One should contrast this quantity, which gives the mortality\nrate among senior citizens, with the \"inverse\" probability of E\nconditional on H, PH(E) =\nP(H & E)/P(H) =\n0.00495/0.00873 = 0.57, which is the proportion of deaths in the\ntotal population that occurred among seniors.\n\n Here are some straightforward consequences of (1.1):\n\nProbability. PE is a\nprobability\n function.[2]\nLogical Consequence. If E entails H,\nthen PE(H) = 1.\nPreservation of Certainties. If P(H) = 1,\nthen PE(H) = 1.\nMixing. P(H) =\nP(E)PE(H) +\n P(~E)P~E(H).[3]\n\n\n\nThe most important fact about conditional probabilities is undoubtedly\nBayes' Theorem, whose significance was first appreciated by\nthe British cleric Thomas Bayes in his posthumously published\nmasterwork, \"An Essay Toward Solving a Problem in the Doctrine of\nChances\" (Bayes 1764).  Bayes' Theorem relates the \"direct\"\nprobability of a hypothesis conditional on a given body of data,\nPE(H), to the \"inverse\"\nprobability of the data conditional on the hypothesis,\nPH(E).\n\n\n\n(1.2)\nBayes' Theorem.\n\n\n\nPE(H) =\n [P(H)/P(E)]\n PH(E)\n\n\n\n\n In an unfortunate, but now unavoidable, choice of terminology,\nstatisticians refer to the inverse probability\nPH(E) as the \"likelihood\" of\nH on E.  It expresses the degree to which the\nhypothesis predicts the data given the background information\ncodified in the probability P.\n\n In the example discussed above, the condition that J. Doe died during 2000\nis a fairly strong predictor of senior citizenship.  Indeed, the equation\nPH(E) = 0.57 tells us that 57% of the\ntotal deaths occurred among seniors that year.  Bayes' theorem lets\nus use this information to compute the \"direct\" probability of J. Doe\ndying given that he or she was a senior citizen.  We do this by\nmultiplying the \"prediction term\"\nPH(E) by the ratio of the total number\nof deaths in the population to the number of senior citizens in the\npopulation, P(H)/P(E) = 2.4M/16.6M =\n0.144.  The result is PE(H) = 0.57 \u00d7\n0.144 = 0.082, just as expected.\n\n Though a mathematical triviality, Bayes' Theorem is of great value\nin calculating conditional probabilities because inverse probabilities\nare typically both easier to ascertain and less subjective than direct\nprobabilities. People with different views about the unconditional\nprobabilities of E and H often disagree about\nE's value as an indicator of H.  Even so, they can\nagree about the degree to which the hypothesis predicts the data if\nthey know any of the following intersubjectively available facts: (a)\nE's objective probability given H, (b) the\nfrequency with which events like E will occur if H\nis true, or (c) the fact that H logically entails\nE. Scientists often design experiments so that likelihoods\ncan be known in one of these \"objective\" ways.  Bayes' Theorem then\nensures that any dispute about the significance of the experimental\nresults can be traced to \"subjective\" disagreements about the\nunconditional probabilities of H and E.\n\n When both PH(E) and\nP~H(E) are known an experimenter\nneed not even know E's probability to determine a value for\nPE(H) using Bayes' Theorem.\n\n\n\n(1.3)\nBayes' Theorem (2nd\n form).[4]\n\n\n\nPE(H) = \nP(H)PH(E)\n / [P(H)PH(E)\n+ P(~H)P~H(E)]\n\n\n\n\n In this guise Bayes' theorem is particularly useful for inferring\ncauses from their effects since it is often fairly easy to discern the\nprobability of an effect given the presence or absence of a putative\ncause. For instance, physicians often screen for diseases of known\nprevalence using diagnostic tests of recognized sensitivity\nand specificity.  The sensitivity of a test, its \"true\npositive\" rate, is the fraction of times that patients with the\ndisease test positive for it. The test's specificity, its \"true\nnegative\" rate, is the proportion of healthy patients who test\nnegative. If we let H be the event of a given patient having\nthe disease, and E be the event of her testing positive for\nit, then the test's sensitivity and specificity are given by the\nlikelihoods PH(E) and\nP~H(~E), respectively,\nand the \"baseline\" prevalence of the disease in the population is\nP(H).  Given these inputs about the effects of the\ndisease on the outcome of the test, one can use (1.3) to determine the\nprobability of disease given a positive test.
