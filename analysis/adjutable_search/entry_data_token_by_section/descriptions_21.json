    "main_text": "Descriptions through the lens\u00a0of linguistics || Determiners as case markers\n7.3 Determiners as case markers\n\nDeterminers are rare in the world\u2019s languages and are not\nuniversally employed in Indo-European languages. For example they are\nnot found in Slavic languages, with the exception of southern Slavic\nlanguages like Bulgarian. But perhaps this provides an opportunity to\ngain some insights into the nature of determiners. We can actually\nstudy how the Bulgarian determiner system evolved from other Slavic\nlanguages.\n\nOne interesting fact to observe here, is that as noted by Hewson\n(1972; 66\u201367), languages with articles and languages with robust\ncase morphology are typically in complementary distribution. Indeed,\nas languages evolve, their robust inflectional system gives way to\nstructure dependent language (Leiss (2000)). It is when the case\nsystem weakens that determiners begin to appear\u2013\u2013an idea\nthat is offered in Abraham (1997:29), Philippi (1997:63\u201364),\nSelig (1992), Ivan\u010dev 1988:105, and (Mayer 1988: 112). As\nMladenova (2007) puts it, \u201cthe morphology of the definite\narticle makes it possible to perpetuate case distinctions long after\nthey have been obliterated elsewhere.\u201d (But see also Mladenova\nfor subtleties in applying this idea to Bulgarian.) Could it be then\nthat determiners serve the purpose of case marking? Iliev (2019)\nargues that this is what is happening in\nBulgarian\u2013\u2013genitive case markers have been replace by\ndeterminers, which continue to\u00a0express a kind of possessive\nrelation.\n\nHow does this idea work?\u00a0We can illustrate with some examples\nfrom English.\n\n\n(64) The car went in the ditch.\n\n(65) I was such a terrible bowler that the ball went in the\ngutter.\n\n(66) The car needs gas.\n\n(67) The doctor told me to stop eating red meat.\n\n\nIt is easy to hear all of these examples as involving an implicit\npossessive operator.\n\n\n(64\u2032) The car went in the road\u2019s ditch.\n\n(65\u2032) I was such a terrible bowler that my ball went in\nmy lane\u2019s gutter.\n\n(66\u2032) Our car needs gas.\n\n(67\u2032) My doctor told me to stop eating red meat.\n\n\nExample (65) is particularly instructive in this regard. If I am an\nexceptionally terrible bowler I might toss the ball into the gutter of\nsomeone else\u2019s lane. In this case I might be more apt to say\n\u201cThe ball went in a gutter\u201d; saying that it went\nin the gutter doesn\u2019t quite seem to do justice to my failure as\na bowler. That is because when I say the ball went in the\ngutter it suggests that it at least ended up in my\ngutter.\n\nThe claim, however, is not that the definite determiner is functioning\nas a possessive. The hypothesis is that it is functioning as a\nmulti-purpose case marker, and when it is marking for genitive case,\npossessive meaning is one possible outcome. But genitive case can be\nput to other uses. For example, species names are routinely given in\nthe genitive case in Latin, and indeed it is a prescriptive rule about\nthe coining of a new species name that it be placed in genitive case.\nThe underlying deep motivation is presumably that species are part of\na genus, so that when one expresses a species name it is shorthand for\na more complete description. So, for example, when we say \u2018The\ntiger\u2019, we are offering up an abbreviation of something like\n\u2018tiger, species of genus panthera\u2019 (or more accurately,\n\u2018panthera tigris, of genus panther\u2019). Note the possessive\nnature of these constructions. In effect, we are saying this:\n\u2018species panthera tigris, belonging to the genus\npanthera\u2019.\n\nThis genitive case analysis perhaps sheds light on what is going on in\nthe array of facts offered by Abbott and Horn. Consider (46)\nagain.\n\n\n(46) So Lufthansa is a\u2014or even the\u2014German\nairline.\n\n\nAs observed earlier, (46) can be asserted even if there is more than\none German airline. One intriguing possibility here is that the stress\nis creating what is known as a superlative genitive, an\nexample from Latin being sanctum sanctorum (holy of holies).\nIn the case of (46), for example, we are saying Lufthansa is the most\nGerman airline of German airlines. This idea would require a story\ninvolving some movement and copying of the noun within the determiner\nphrase, but such a story would not be unheard of in contemporary work\non the structure of determiner phrases (see Larson (2014)).\n\nWhat is also intriguing about this line of inquiry is that it suggests\na new strategy for accounting for definiteness. It is not\npragmatically extruded from givenness (as suggested by Ludlow and\nSegal) but rather from whatever meaning the genitive case brings with\nit \u2013 often some notion of possession. For example, an appearance\nof a description of the form \u2018the dog\u2019 in a sentence might\nindicate something like \u2018dog of the event\u2019 or \u2018dog\nbearing some thematic role to the event\u2019. From this bit of\ninformation, the pragmatics might allow us infer that there is a\nunique dog.\n\nIt would not be fruitful to suggest that definite determiners\nalways play the role of case assignment, and they most\ncertainly cannot be cashed out as exclusively assigning genitive case.\nThe prospects for a unified explanation for determiner behavior seems\nremote. The evidence does suggest however, that definite determiners\ncan often play the role of supplying case, and this may go some way\ntowards explaining some of the most recalcitrant facts involving\ndescriptions.\n",
