    "main_text": "Was classical genetics reduced to molecular genetics? || Schaffner's thesis that classical genetics is being theoretically reduced\n3.1 Schaffner's thesis that classical genetics is being theoretically reduced\n\n\nReductionism has many meanings. For example, the phrase genetic\nreductionism concerns the idea that all biological phenomena are\ncaused by genes, and hence presupposes an ontological sense of\nreductionism according to which one kind of micro-entity (in this case,\ngene) exclusively causes a variety of higher-level phenomena (in this\ncase, biological features, cultural phenomena, and so forth). But\nthis is not the meaning of reductionism at issue in the philosophical\nliterature about the reduction of classical genetics. This literature\nis more concerned with epistemology than metaphysics. The concept of\nreductionism at issue is Nagel's concept of\ntheoretical reduction. (See Sarkar 1992 and Schaffner 1993 for\ndiscussions of alternative conceptions of reduction.) According to\nNagel's concept, the reduction of one science to\nanother science entails the reduction of the central theory of\none science to the central theory of the other. Nagel believed\nthat this kind of theoretical reduction led to progressive changes in\nscientific knowledge. He formulated two formal requirements for\ntheoretical reductions.\n\n\nNagel's first formal requirements was that the \u201claws\u201d of\nthe reduced theory must be derivable from the laws and associated\ncoordinating definitions of the reducing theory. This deducibility\nrequirement was intended to capture the idea that the explanatory\nprinciples (or laws) of the reducing theory ought to explain the\nexplanatory principles (or laws) of the reduced theory. Nagel's\nsecond formal requirement, the connectability requirement, was that\nall essential terms of the reduced theory must either be contained\nwithin or be appropriately connected to the terms of the reducing\ntheory by way of additional assumptions. The connectability\nrequirement is presupposed by the derivability requirement,\nbut making it explicit helps emphasize an important task and potential\nstumbling block for carrying out theoretical reduction.\n\n\nSchaffner (1969) modified Nagel's model by\nincorporating the idea that what the reducing theory actually derives\n(and hence explains) is a corrected version of the reduced theory, not\nthe original theory. He argued that this revised model\nbetter captured reductions in the physical sciences. He claimed his\nrevised model could also be used to show how a corrected version of\nclassical genetics was being reduced to a new theory of physicochemical\nscience called molecular genetics. Hull (1974) countered that classical\ngenetics was not being reduced, at least not according to the model of\nreduction being applied by Schaffner. Hull argued that genetics did not\nexemplify Nagelian reduction because the fundamental terms of classical\ngenetics could not be suitably connected to expressions couched in\nterms of DNA.\n",
