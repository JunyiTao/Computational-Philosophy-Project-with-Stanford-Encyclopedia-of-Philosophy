    "main_text": "Historical Accounts of Exploitation || Neoclassical Accounts\n1.3 Neoclassical Accounts\n\nThe idea that workers have rights to the contributions their labour\nmakes to the production of a social surplus is, we noted, common to\nboth Marxist and Libertarian theories. Yet, the widespread rejection\nof the labour theory of value apparently undermines (Cohen\u2019s\narguments notwithstanding) of Marx\u2019s classical account of\nexploitation. Neoclassical economists subsequently developed an\naccount of exploitation that incorporates this concern for an\ninput\u2019s contribution to the productive surplus that is\ncompatible with the subjective theory of value that replaced labour\ntheories in mainstream economic thinking. This account claims \u201ca\nfactor of production is exploited if it is employed at a price which\nis less than its marginal net productivity\u201d (Robinson 1933:\n281).\n\nThe neoclassical account was first fully developed by A. C. Pigou in\nThe Economics of Welfare (1920) and was refined by Joan\nRobinson in The Economics of Perfect Competition (1933),\nthough Reiff (2013) identifies both Alfred Marshall and John Bates\nClark as influences on Pigou\u2019s approach. Neoclassical accounts\nare, in many ways, precursors to contemporary market-based accounts of\nexploitation. Their move away from the labour theory of value allows\nthem to escape some of the technical problems that the classical\nMarxist definition encounters. However, they face their own technical\nand moral objections. Here we discuss three.\n\nFirst, according to the neoclassical account, exploitation is\nimpossible under perfect competition. Whether this aspect of the\nneoclassical account is a bug or feature depends on whether one thinks\nthat competitive markets and the pressures they can place on\nindividuals\u2014or the capitalist system, for Marxists\u2014can be\nexploitative. A point against the neoclassical account is that it\nseems that conclusions about whether or not competitive markets can be\nexploitative should be the result of substantive moral argument and\nnot merely settled by stipulative definition. On the other hand, the\nidea that market competition precludes at least certain causes of\nexploitation is compelling. Perfectly competitive markets exclude\nabuses of power by monopolists and monopsonists and the abuse of\ninformational asymmetries (Wertheimer 1996). A competitive market is a\ncontext in which the price that one pays for goods and services is\nshaped by the availability of these resources (supply) and the degree\nto which others need or want them (demand).\n\nSecond, the neoclassical account does not limit exploitation to\nlabour. The account also allows for the exploitation of other factors\nof production. Factors of production\u2014which classically comprise\nland, labour and capital\u2014are those resources used to produced\noutputs. The returns to any of these factors can be less than their\nmarginal product and when they are, on the neoclassical account, they\nare exploited. As with views about whether markets are exploitative,\nwhether capital can be exploited should be the conclusion of\nsubstantive moral argument and not settled by a definition. One might\nargue that the neoclassical account provides a technical and\nnonmoralised account of exploitation and further, that only the\nexploitation of labour is morally important. In this case, the\nneoclassical account would be an incomplete account of wrongful\nexploitation that requires supplemental arguments about the moral\nimportance of labour (like those advanced in Cohen 1979).\n\nFinally, and arguably most problematic, associating fair pay with\nworkers\u2019 marginal productivity means giving different workers\ndifferent pay for the same work. Decreasing marginal productivity\nmeans that the productivity associated with each additional laborer\ndecreases as more workers are added. Early hires will be associated\nwith greater marginal productivity than those who join later, even if\nthey all perform identical tasks. This also means that if an\n\u2018early\u2019 employee quits, the nonexploitative wage of an\nemployee hired later increases (because their marginal\ncontribution has increased). Thus, the neoclassical account cannot\nsatisfy the intuition that fair employment requires equal remuneration\nfor equal work. This problem can be avoided by modifying the\nneoclassical account so that exploitation consists in paying labour\nless than its average product. Yet the average product\napproach still cannot accurately track the contributions to output of\nindividual workers if some are more productive than\nothers.\n\nEach of the historical approaches surveyed here\u2014Pre-Marxian\naccounts, Marx\u2019s account, and neoclassical accounts\u2014have\ninfluenced and, to some degree, been incorporated into the\ncontemporary accounts that we cover in the following section.\n",
