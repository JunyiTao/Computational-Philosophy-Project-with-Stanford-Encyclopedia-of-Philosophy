    "preamble": "\n\nWhat it takes to be ultimate is to be the most fundamentally real,\nvaluable or fulfilling among all that there is or could be.\nHistorically, philosophy of religion in the West has taken God to be\nultimate. Over the past century, the field has become increasingly\naware that ultimacy is grasped under different concepts in the\nworld\u2019s religions, philosophies and\nquasi-religious philosophies\u2014so not only as \u201cGod\u201d\nbut also as, e.g., \u201cBrahman\u201d, \u201cthe Dao\u201d, and\nmore. Moreover, people have thought to conceptualize each of these\nultimates in numerous ways across cultures and times, so there are\nmany models of Brahman, many models of God, many models of the Dao,\nand more; perhaps there is even a model of what is ultimate for each\nperson who has thought hard about it. This entry presents a framework\nfor understanding this vast landscape of models of God and other\nultimates and then surveys some of its major sights. Familiarity with\nthis landscape can clarify the long journey to deciding whether there\nis anything ultimate, among other benefits.\n\nSection 1 defines \u201cultimate\u201d and \u201cmodels\u201d of\nultimates, discusses reasons to be interested in the project of\nmodeling what is ultimate or alternatively to think it futile, and\nexplains major categories that help organize the field of models.\nSection 2 uses these categories to relay over twenty models of\nBrahman, God and the Dao, both for their own sakes and as\nentr\u00e9es into the landscape (the models are numbered as they\nsurface to help the reader spot them and to show by example what a\nmodel is). Section 3 discusses the significance of the plurality of\nmodels once they are juxtaposed.\n",

    "main_text": "\n1. Conceptual Foundations and Motivations\n1.1 Definition of \u201cultimate\u201d\n\nBrahman, the Dao, emptiness, God, the One, Reasonableness\u2014there,\nin alphabetical order, are names of the central subjects of concern in\nwhat are commonly parsed as some of the world\u2019s religions,\nphilosophies and\n quasi-religious-philosophies.[1]\n They are all names for what is ultimate, at least on some uses of the\nnames (for instance, \u201cGod\u201d is not always taken to be\nultimate, more soon). But what is it to be ultimate, in this\nsense?\n\nTo answer in terms of its use, the term \u201cultimacy\u201d, meaning\nthe state or nature of being ultimate, has Brahman, the Dao, emptiness\netc. as instances. To answer semantically, with a meaning, is\ndifficult for at least two reasons. First, though there is abundant\nprecedent in the literature for collecting these subjects as ideas of\n ultimacy,[2]\n doing so presupposes they have some shared characteristic or family\nresemblance that makes them count as ultimate. But is there a\nshared core idea of being ultimate? \u201cParticularists\u201d among\nothers argue no: the diverse range of cultural and historical contexts\nfrom which these subjects come, coupled with how hard it is to talk\nacross such contexts, makes them all \u201cseparate cultural\nislands\u201d (Hedges 2014: 206; see also Berthrong 2001:\n237\u2013239,\n 255\u2013256).[3]\n The second concern is related, and not far from one Tomoko Masuzawa\n(2005) among others has raised about religion: even if we found a\nsubstantive account of ultimacy visible in multiple traditions, such\nan account necessarily will be borne from a cultural conceptual\ncontext. Thus, far from delivering the notions at work in other\ntraditions, such an account actually risks de-forming them.\n\nRegarding the first concern, John H. Berthrong, among others, is far\nmore optimistic than the particularists that concepts not only can be\nshared across cultures but in fact are\n\n\nalready comparative, having been generated by the interactions of\npeople, texts, rituals, cultural sensibilities and the vagaries of\nhistory and local customs. (2001: 238)\n\n\nOther theorists explore factors that could detail or add to\nBerthrong\u2019s list\u2014e.g., trade and conquests (Gayatriprana\n2020), shared human evolutionary biology (Wildman 2017), and the\nevolution of moral development (Wright\n 2010).[4]\n Still, most take the second concern about enculturation to stick and\nthus to temper the optimism: there is both a shared humanity\nand real cultural difference to own in reaching a global idea\nof ultimacy. Raimon Panikkar says it well:\n\n\nBrahman is certainly not the one true and living God of the\nAbrahamic traditions. Nor can it be said that Shang-ti or\nkami are the same as brahman. And yet they are not\ntotally unrelated. (Panikkar 1987 [2005: 2254])\n\n\nThe Cross-Cultural Comparative Religious Ideas Project, run by Robert\nC. Neville and Wesley Wildman from 1995\u201399, balanced the overlap\nand difference when they concluded that an account of ultimacy should\nbe a \u201cproperly vague\u201d category: it needs enough shared\ncontent to count as a category, but enough vagueness to cover the\ndisparate instances generally taken to be\n ultimates.[5]\n There are multiple contenders for such vague categories, including,\ne.g., Paul Tillich\u2019s \u201cobject of ultimate concern\u201d\n(1957a, e.g., 10\u201311), John Hick\u2019s \u201cthe Real\u201d\n(1989: 11ff); Keith Ward\u2019s \u201cthe Transcendent\u201d\n(1998); and the Project\u2019s own proposal as \u201cthat which is\nmost important to religious life because of the nature of\nreality\u201d (Neville & Wildman 2001, see 151ff for an\nexplanation of each part of the phrase).\n\nInformed by the Project\u2019s finding, this entry will\n\u201cvague-ify\u201d the content of John Schellenberg\u2019s\naccount of what is ultimate to use as a cross-cultural core idea of\nultimacy and as an organizing principle. To paraphrase, Schellenberg\ntakes being ultimate to mean being that which is (1) the most real,\n(2) the most valuable, and (3) the source of deepest fulfillment among\nall that is or perhaps could be. More carefully, and in\nSchellenberg\u2019s words, being ultimate requires being ultimate in\nthree ways: (1) metaphysically ultimate, i.e., the \u201cmost\nfundamental fact\u201d about the nature of things (2016: 168), (2)\naxiologically ultimate, i.e., that which \u201chas unsurpassably\ngreat value\u201d (2009: 31), meaning greatness along all its\ncategories of being, and (3) soteriologically ultimate, i.e.,\n\u201cthe source of an ultimate good (salvific)\u201d (2009: xii,\nalso 2005: 15), meaning being the source of salvation or liberation of\nthe kind practitioners of the world\u2019s religions and philosophies\nardently seek (e.g., nirvana, communing with God, moksha, ascent to\nthe One, etc.), whether these all amount to the same salvation (e.g.,\nHick 1989: Ch. 14) or constitute radically distinct types of\nsalvations (Heim 1995: Ch. 5). Schellenberg\u2019s choice of these\nthree terms is insightful: most extant takes on ultimacy per\nse and on Brahman, God and the Dao in particular are variations\non a theme of Schellenberg, as scrutiny of even the brief definitions\nabove as well as the models in\n Section 2\n will bear\n out.[6]\n\nSchellenberg\u2019s account of what it takes to be ultimate is\nalready somewhat vague: he recommends no further precisification of\nhis three terms in order to stay open about what counts as ultimate as\nour knowledge grows (2009: 31). This entry will loosen his account\nfurther by placing a disjunction between its terms instead of a\nconjunction. That is, Schellenberg takes metaphysical, axiological and\nsoteriological ultimacy to be severally necessary and jointly\nsufficient for something to count as ultimate; he requires\n\u201ctriple ultimacy\u201d, as James Elliott calls it, for ultimacy\nper se (2017: 103\u201304). Those who agree in principle\ninclude, e.g., Clooney 2001 and Rubenstein\n 2019,[7]\n as well as, e.g., Aquinas, Leibniz and Samuel Clarke, who in fact\nargue that, given the entailments between the terms, there is triple\nultimacy or none at\n all.[8]\n Others take double or even single ultimacy to be not only possible\nbut also sufficient for being ultimate. For example, Neville defines\nultimacy in strictly metaphysical terms as \u201cthe ontological act\nof creation\u201d (2013: 1); Elliott and Paul Draper each take\nsoteriological ultimacy to be sufficient for ultimacy (Elliott 2017:\n105\u2013109; Draper 2019: 161); and John Bacon takes his\nunderstanding of God as \u201c<Creator, Good>\u201d to be\nmetaphysically and soteriologically ultimate though a \u201clet-down\naxiologically\u201d (2013: 548). Moreover, requiring triple ultimacy\nstops some of the paradigmatic models of Brahman, God and the Dao from\ncounting as ultimacy, as\n Section 2\n will demonstrate (see also Diller 2013b). Thus, this entry will take\nsome combinations of the three types of ultimacy to be sufficient for\nbeing ultimate, without settling which, provided nothing else in a\nsystem has more. Note that replacing Schellenberg\u2019s conjunction\nwith a disjunction makes the field of ultimates a family resemblance\nclass.\n\nEven disjunctivized, the Schellenbergian view adopted here is clearly\nan inheritance from Abrahamic perfect being\n theology,[9]\n so two cautions about scope. First, when we look outward and find\nthat some non-Abrahamic traditions have ultimacy in the sense\nhere\u2014as we will in\n Section 2\n for Hinduism and Daoism\u2014we should acknowledge that this result\ncomes framed from the outside. Second, not all non-Abrahamic\ntraditions will have ultimates in the sense just adopted. For\ninstance, to offer just one example, Barbara Mann suggests that in\nnon-colonized interpretations of Native American spiritualities there\nis nothing that is ultimate in Schellenberg\u2019s sense (2010:\n 33\u201336).[10]\n So ultimacy as just defined may be widespread in the world\u2019s\nreligions and spiritualities, but it is not universal.\n\nFinally, three points of clarification about terminology. First,\ntalking about ultimacy does not entail that anything ultimate exists.\nThe concern that it might is related to \u201cthe problem of singular\nnegative existential statements\u201d, to which Frege and Russell\noffered solutions that in turn have been enshrined in predicate logic,\nthough not without complaint (for more see Kripke 2013 and the SEP\narticles on\n existence\n and on\n nonexistent objects).\n Second, the term \u201cultimate reality\u201d could be taken to\nmean how reality ultimately is\u2014i.e., that which is\nmetaphysically ultimate, perhaps a part of every complete\nontology\u2014instead of meaning the richer sense of\n\u201cultimacy\u201d at issue here, which is not a part of every\ncomplete\n ontology.[11]\n To avoid confusion, this entry will reserve the term \u201cultimate\nreality\u201d for metaphysical ultimacy per se and use\n\u201cultimate\u201d and variants for the combinations of the\nSchellenbergian\n disjunction.[12]\n Thus framed, the distinction leaves open this central question: is\nultimate reality ultimate? Lastly, regarding the choice of the term\n\u201cultimate\u201d and its variants, there is a syntactic parallel\nto the semantic issue above: we need a sufficiently vague kind of\nspeech to cover the diverse ontological kinds implicit in accounts of\nultimacy, including concrete or abstract particular things (e.g., God\nor Brahman on some views); states of being (e.g.,\nExistence-Consciousness-Bliss for Brahman, see\n Section 2.1);\n properties (e.g., everything is empty on Buddhism or divinely\nintentional for Karl Pfeifer, see\n Section 2.2);\n actions and events that things perform or undergo (D. Cooper models\nGod as \u201ca verb\u201d as in \u201cGod-ing\u201d, 1997: 70; cf.\nBishop & Perszyk 2017); and grounds of being that are meant to be\ncategory-less (e.g., as in \u201cthe creative source of the\ncategories themselves\u201d, Vallicella 2006 [2019], see also, e.g.,\nTillich in\n Section 2.2,\n the Dao in\n Section 2.3).\n Though no term is quite right given the diversity, this entry uses\nthe adjective form of being \u201cultimate\u201d as primary, to\ndescribe x as metaphysically, axiologically or\nsoteriologically ultimate per above, whatever x\u2019s\nontological kind (cf. with the more familiar term from Abrahamic\nmonotheism of \u201cdivine\u201d). It also uses \u201cultimacy\u201d\nas a noun for the nature or state of being ultimate (cf.\n\u201cdivinity\u201d), the nouns \u201cthe ultimate\u201d, \u201can\nultimate\u201d or \u201cultimates\u201d to function flexibly both as a\nmass noun (such as \u201cwater\u201d or \u201cbutter\u201d) for\nthe property or uncountable substance of being ultimate and as a count\nnoun for things, events and grounds of being (cf. \u201cGod\u201d or\n\u201cgods\u201d); and \u201cto ultimize\u201d as the verb form,\nif ever we need\n it.[13]\n1.2 Definition of \u201cmodel\u201d\n\nA \u201cmodel\u201d of what is ultimate is a way it can be conceived.\nIn general, a model is a representation of a target phenomenon for\nsome purpose. For instance, R. Axelrod developed a computational model\nthat represented a target of two \u201cagents\u201d caught in an\niterated prisoner\u2019s dilemma, with the purpose of solving the\n dilemma.[14]\n\nThe term \u201cmodel\u201d in religious and philosophical contexts\nis related to but not identical with its use in scientific contexts,\nin ways Ian Barbour (1974) foundationally traced. Though there is some\ndisagreement between the fields on whether models describe their\ntarget or not and what the point of modeling is, importantly, in both\ncontexts, the term \u201cmodel\u201d (1) connotes that its target is\nsomehow out of reach\u2014not able to be directly examined\u2014and,\nperhaps by force of this, (2) encodes a conceptual distance between\nthe target and the model. In particular, the model is not a copy of\nthe target but rather chooses revealing aspects of the target to relay\nby leaving out or distorting other\n aspects.[15]\n Think of a model of a city that is by design not to scale, precisely\nso viewers can see the relationships between the city\u2019s streets,\nbuildings and neighborhoods. Models are thus simultaneously\nepistemically instructive and humble.\n\nThus understood, \u201cmodel\u201d captures well the ways people\nhave thought about what is ultimate. Taking a model\u2019s target to\nbe obscured per (1) and the model itself to be fallible per (2) is not\nonly apt but also crucial for thinking about what is ultimate given\nour necessarily limited knowledge of it (see\n Section 1.4).\n Moreover, among the choices on the linguistic menu,\n\u201cmodel\u201d is a middle way. It is more specific than\n\u201cidea\u201d understood in the Cartesian sense as\n\u201cwhatever is immediately perceived by the\n mind\u201d,[16]\n since a model is the more particular kind of idea just relayed. At\nthe same time, \u201cmodel\u201d is general enough to cover the very\ndiverse kinds of extant linguistic accounts of what is ultimate in the\nliterature, including, e.g., \u201cconcepts\u201d understood in the\nclassic sense as necessary and sufficient conditions for being\nultimate, such as Anselm\u2019s idea of God as \u201cthat than which\nno greater can be conceived;\u201d \u201cconceptions\u201d which\nare \u201cmore particular fillers\u201d for more general concepts,\nsuch as Richard Swinburne\u2019s verdict about what it would take to\nbe that than which nothing greater can be\n conceived;[17]\n sustained \u201cmetaphors\u201d such as Ramanuja\u2019s Brahman as\nthe \u201cSoul\u201d of the cosmos (see\n Section 2.1)\n or Sallie McFague\u2019s \u201cGod as Mother, Lover and\nFriend\u201d (1987); and \u201cindexical signs\u201d that point to\nan indeterminate ultimate visible in Neville (2013). This entry will\ncall all these linguistic types \u201cmodels\u201d of what is\nultimate, given that they each in their own way represent or aim at a\ntarget of what is ultimate for various purposes, at least as much as\nlanguage can (more in\n Section 1.4).[18]\n\nAs\n Section 1.5\n will detail, some models of what is ultimate nest, e.g.,\nShankara\u2019s idea of Brahman is a species of Vedantic ideas of\nBrahman which in turn are species of Hindu ideas of Brahman. To\nsimplify, this entry will use the term \u201cmodel\u201d for ideas\nof what is ultimate at all levels, and take a model\u2019s target to\nbe \u201cthe ultimate\u201d if the modeler thinks what is ultimate is\nsingle or uncountable (as in models of e.g., Brahman, God and the Dao)\nor \u201cultimates\u201d if multiple (as in polytheistic or perhaps\ncommunotheistic models).\n1.3 Motivations\n\nUnderstanding the scope of the work on modeling what is ultimate is\ncentral in multiple ways for assessing claims about its existence.\nFirst, the meaning we have in mind for \u201cx\u201d can\ndecide our take on whether x exists. For example, in the case\nof God, some are convinced by arguments from suffering that there is\nno God, but such arguments, even if they succeed, generally apply only\nto God conceived as an omnipotent, omniscient and omnibenevolent\n(\u201cOOO\u201d) person and as written do not apply to God\nconceived differently (\u201cgenerally\u201d since there are notable\nexceptions, e.g., Bishop 2007 and Bishop & Perszyk 2016). Further,\nthe act of abandoning one model while being aware that there are\nalternative models can set up an exploration into the field of models\nof the ultimate or ultimates. For example, if one decides there is no\nOOO personal God, one might ask: are there any other models\nof God genuinely worth the name \u201cGod\u201d without these\nproperties? If not, are there perhaps any non-theistic (non-God)\nmodels of what is ultimate without these properties? In other words,\nfor those who have a limited sense of what it takes to be ultimate\n(e.g., what is ultimate is a OOO God or nothing at all), a search of\nextant models can open up the range of options on their menu and\nposition them to see whether any are philosophically palatable. In\nfact, such a search may be required in order to settle the question of\nwhether anything ultimate exists, because it is invalid to conclude\nthat there is nothing ultimate on the basis of arguments against\nspecific models of ultimacy if there could still be genuine ultimacy\nof another kind (see Diller 2016: 123\u2013124).\n\nIn addition to their pivotal role in deciding questions of existence,\nnotions of what is ultimate profoundly impact questions about\nreligious diversity, such as whether multiple religions can have\nsimultaneously true core beliefs. For example, on \u201cplenitude of\nbeing\u201d models\u2014where the ultimate is infinitely full of\nincommensurable content\u2014multiple religions are taken to be\ngrasping different aspects of it accurately. So multiple religions can\nhave true beliefs about what is ultimate, even if each has only a part\nof the truth. Finally, models of what is ultimate are also intimately\nbound up with philosophical questions of meaning, e.g., in\nmeaning\u2019s \u201cCosmic\u201d and \u201cUltimate\u201d senses\nas Rivka Weinberg explains them, though she decides that even if there\nwere something ultimate, it would not finally deliver meaning in\neither sense (2021).\n1.4 Challenges\n\nThough some model what is ultimate, others object to the entire\nproject of modeling it. There are three main kinds of concerns in the\nliterature: about the existence of ultimacy, about the coherence of\nthe very idea of ultimacy, and about whether talk and knowledge of\nultimacy is humanly possible, even assuming the idea is coherent. The\nfirst concern is motivational: for those who think there is nothing\nultimate, there seems no point worrying about how it has been\nconceived. However, as indicated in\n Section 1.3,\n it is invalid to conclude that there is nothing ultimate without\nhaving some sense of the range of what it might be. So even those who\nthink there is nothing ultimate are thrown into the project of\nmodeling it\u2014at least enough to license the conclusion that this\nwork is not worth doing.\n\nTo offer just one example of the second challenge, Stephen Maitzen\n(2017) argues against the concept of ultimacy on multiple fronts,\nincluding, e.g., that nothing can be metaphysically ultimate in\nSchellenberg\u2019s sense because it would need to be simultaneously\na se and concrete so that it can be metaphysically\nindependent and explain concrete things, respectively. But no\nconcrete thing can explain itself because (to shorten the argument\nconsiderably) even the necessity of such a thing is not identical to\nitself so it is not explaining itself (2017: 53). If Maitzen is right,\nnothing can be metaphysically ultimate in Schellenberg\u2019s sense,\nand thus not metaphysically, axiologically and soteriologically\nultimate at once.\n\nThe third kind of concern is more widespread\u2014that it makes no\nsense for us to model what is ultimate because it is beyond human\nlanguage (ineffable) or beyond human cognitive grasp (cognitively\nunknowable), or both. Why think this? To combine a few common\narguments: what is ultimate (1) goes beyond the world, (2) is in a\nclass by itself, and (3) is infinite, while our predicates are\n(1\u2032) suited to describe things in the world, (2\u2032) classify\nthings with other things, and (3\u2032) are limited (see, e.g.,\nWildman 2013: 770; Seeskin 2013: 794\u2013795). Thus, for any\nP, a statement of the form \u201cultimacy is\nP\u201d seems necessarily false, if it is meaningful at all.\nIneffability and unknowability are related: if we can say nothing true\nabout ultimacy, then we can know nothing about it\u2014at least\nnothing that can be said in words.\n\nThat last hesitation\u2014\u201cat least not in\nwords\u201d\u2014leaves room for, e.g., embodied ways of knowing by\nway of religious, mystical or spiritual experiences which are reported\nin the world\u2019s religious traditions and more generally (whether\nsuch experiences actually happen or not, see, e.g., James 1902\n[1961]). Still, the combined arguments above and the gut intuition\nbehind them represent an enormous challenge to the whole enterprise of\nmodeling what is ultimate in words. There are those who opt\nfor silence in the face of these arguments, and thus understandably\nbut alas \u201cliterally disappear from the conversation\u201d\n(Wildman 2013: 768, \u201calas\u201d because they are missed). One\nmain move of those who do keep talking is to distinguish what is\nultimate as it is in itself, which they concede we can never talk\nabout or know, from it as it affects our experience, which they think\nwe can talk about and know. So some distinguish, e.g., the\nabsolute from the relative Dao (Daodejing, chapter 1); the\nGodhead from God as revealed (Meister Eckhart, e.g., Sermon 97;\nPanikkar 1987 [2005: 2254]); the noumenal from the phenomenal Real (Hick\n1989) etc. and talk or make knowledge claims only about the latter\n(see also, e.g., Paul Hedges 2020\n [Other Internet Resources]).[19]\n\nSome also claim to make true statements about what is ultimate by\nrestricting those statements to certain kinds of claims about it. One\ntactic is to talk about how ultimacy is related to us or to other\nparts of the natural (or non-natural) world instead of talking about\nhow it is in itself, i.e., to talk about its extrinsic vs. intrinsic\nproperties. For example, Maimonides suggests that one way to make\n\u201cultimacy is P\u201d true is to make P an\n\u201cattribute of action\u201d, i.e., an \u201caction that he who\nis described has performed, such as Zayd carpentered this\ndoor\u2026\u201d (The Guide of the Perplexed,\nI.52\u20133, italics added), an attribute which says nothing about\nZayd\u2019s intrinsic properties save that he has what it takes to\ncarpenter this door. An analogue of this for ultimacy is, e.g.,\nthe Dao generated being, again an attribute which indicates\nonly that the Dao, whatever it is or is not, can and has generated\nbeing. Other possible ways of speaking truly about ultimacy include\nfamously the via negativa (\u201cGod is not\nP\u201d, Shaffer 2013: 783), the via eminentia\n(\u201cGod is better than P\u201d), the way of analogy\n(\u201cGod is perfectly P\u201d, Copleston 1952: 351 on\nAquinas, e.g., Summa Theologica I, 13 and Summa contra\nGentiles I, 30, see also Kennedy 2013: 158\u2013159), the way of\nsuper-eminence (\u201cGod is beyond P or not\nP\u201d, Pseudo-Dionysius, Shaffer 2013: 786ff)\nand\u2014though this seems doable in theory only\u2014equivocal\npredication (\u201cGod is P*\u201d where P* is a\npredicate outside of human language, Shaffer 2013: 783). What does all\nthis really allow us to say, know, and do philosophically, though?\nMore than one might think, says Neville: though ineffability might\nseem to stop metaphysics, it actually tells us how to do the\nmetaphysics, e.g., \u201cthe dao\u2026can be discussed\nmainly by negations and indirections\u201d (2008: 43), or in these\nother ways.\n1.5 Philosophical categories of ultimacy\n\nFor those who decide to model what is ultimate in the face of or\ninformed by these challenges, there are several common categories, or\n\u201cmodel types\u201d as Philip Clayton once called them, which\ndistinguish kinds of models of what is ultimate from each other.\nKnowing these categories can organize what might be an otherwise\nhaphazard array of models, in something like the way knowing what an\noak, maple and birch are can help sort the sights on a walk through a\nforest. The categories of ultimacy are best grasped by framing them\nwith a question. For example, Hartshorne and Reese (1953) categorized\nmodels of God in particular as the logically possible variations on a\ntheme of five questions, whose positive answers get symbolized by\nETCKW:\n\nE: Is God eternal?\nT: Is God temporal?\nC: Is God conscious?\nK: Does God know the world?\nW: Does God include the world?\n\n\nTo use models that will be discussed in\n Section 2,\n Shankara\u2019s pantheism is ECKW since he takes Brahman to be an\n\u201cEternal Consciousness, Knowing and including the World\u201d\nbut which is atemporal and never changes; Hartshorne and Reese\u2019s\nown panentheism is ETCKW, etc. (see their 1953 [2000: 17] and Viney\n2013 for more examples). Wildman (2017) has his own set of questions\nand entire system built out of them (more in\n Section 3),\n which adds another important question that ETCKW leaves out or\nperhaps merely implies: Is what is ultimate\npersonal/anthropomorphic\u2014i.e., is it aware and does it have\nintentions\u2014or is it impersonal/non-anthropomorphic? One might\nalso look for functional categories: is what is ultimate the\nefficient, material or final cause of the universe?, does it intervene\nin it?, does it provoke religious experience?, and more.\n\nAnother question that may be asked about a particular model is: How\nmany ultimates does the model conceive ultimacy to be? Though the very\nidea of plural ultimates sounds contradictory\u2014wouldn\u2019t one\nthing need to beat out all competitors in order to satisfy the\nsuperlatives \u201cmost fundamental\u201d fact,\n\u201chighest\u201d value, \u201cdeepest\u201d source of\nfulfillment?\u2014those who model \u201cultimate multiplicity\u201d\nsee a tie for first place. Some models of Zoroaster\u2019s view, for\ninstance, take there to be two ultimates, the good Ahura Mazda and the\nevil Angra Mainyu engaged in fundamental battle (though such models\nwill have to explain why Ahura Mazda is not the true ultimate given\nhis apparent axiological edge on Angra Mainyu). John Cobb and David\nRay Griffin at least some of the time take there to be three distinct\nultimates: the Supreme Being experienced in theistic experiences,\nBeing Itself (or emptiness) experienced in acosmic experiences, and\nthe Cosmos experienced in cosmic experiences (Griffin 2005:\n 47\u201349).[20]\n Monica Coleman models what is ultimate in traditional Yoruba religion\nas a \u201ccommunotheism\u201d, in which \u201cthe Divine is a\ncommunity of gods who are fundamentally related to each other but\nontologically equal\u201d, including\nOlo\u0301du\u0300mare\u0300 and the 401\no\u0300ri\u0300s\u0327a\u0300 (2013: 345\u2013349). All the\nmodels we will look at in\n Section 2\n will be \u201cultimate unities\u201d although there will be some\ndiversity in the unity for the panentheisms in particular. George\nMavrodes also cautions us to be wary of the unity/multiplicity\ndistinction:\n\n\nthere are monotheisms that seem to include an element of\nmultiplicity\u2014e.g. Christianity with its puzzling idea of the\ndivine trinity\u2014and views of divine multiplicity\u2014such as\nthe African religions [have]\u2014that seem to posit some sort of\nunity composed of a large number of individual divine entities. (2013:\n660)\n\n\nProbably the most frequently-used categories to sort models from each\nother are the logically exhaustive answers to the question: How does\nthe ultimate or ultimates relate to the world? Though the answers (and\nquestion actually) are commonly framed with the word\n\u201cGod\u201d, as the theos root in some of the category\nnames below belies, their descriptions at least are framed here with\n\u201cultimacy\u201d to include non-theistic ultimates,\n too:[21]\n\nMonism (literally, one-ism): There exists just one thing\nor one kind of thing (the \u201cOne\u201d or \u201cUnity\u201d),\ndepending on how the monism is read: either ultimacy is identical to\nthe world, or all there is is ultimacy, or all there is is the world.\nPantheism is a species of monism in which the one thing or\nkind of thing is God, or as Linda Mercadante once said in\nconversation, it is a monism in which the emphasis is on the divinity\nof the world instead of on the worldliness of the divine. Baruch\nSpinoza\u2019s view of \u201cGod, or Nature\u201d (Deus sive\nnatura) is often deemed a\n pantheism,[22]\n though some experts deem it a panentheism (1677, Part IV.4; see,\ne.g., Edwin Curley 2013).\nPanentheism (all-in-God-ism): The world is a proper part\nof ultimacy. I.e., though the world is in ultimacy, ultimacy is more\nthan the world. Panentheism is a wide tent since there is ambiguity in\nthe \u201cin\u201d, but R. T. Mullins, for example, offers one\ndisambiguated panentheism: take space and time to be attributes of\nGod, and \u201caffirm that the universe is literally in God because\nthe universe is spatially and temporally located in God\u201d (2016:\n343).\nMerotheism (part-God-ism): Ultimacy is a proper part of\nthe world. I.e., though ultimacy is in the world, the world is more\nthan ultimacy. This type is rare, but see, e.g., Alexander 1920 and\nDraper 2019 (more soon).\nDualism (two-ism): Ultimacy is not the world and the\nworld is not ultimacy, so there are two fundamentally different things\nor kinds of things, depending on how the underlying ontology is read.\nDualism includes both the view that ultimacy and the world are\ndisjoint (they share no parts) and the view that they bear a relation\nof proper overlap (they overlap in part, but not in\n whole).[23]\n\n\nThe various models of God, Brahman and the Dao in\n Section 2\n taken together will instantiate all four of these categories.\n2. Models of Brahman, God, and the Dao\n\nThis section turns to multiple models of three ultimates extant in\nliving world traditions: Brahman in the Hindu traditions indigenous in\nIndia, God in the Abrahamic traditions (Judaism, Christianity and\nIslam) indigenous in the Middle East and the Arabian Peninsula, and\nthe Dao in the Daoist and Ru (Confucian) traditions indigenous in\nChina. The sections here are ordered historically, with the idea of\nBrahman surfacing first in the Rig Veda ca. 1000\u20131500 BCE, the\nidea of the Dao during the Warring States period ca. fifth century\nBCE, and the idea of God in the Jewish tradition shifting from a\nhenotheistic to monotheistic deity somewhere in between.\n\nA main point of looking at these models is to grasp some ways people\nacross the globe have conceived and are conceiving of what is most\nreal, most valuable or most fulfilling to them\u2014knowledge worth\nhaving for its own sake. Looking at the models also deepens\nunderstanding of ultimacy in general, by seeing how it plays out in\nthe specifics. Finally, studying the models is a window into how they\nrelate. Specifically, as we go, look for (1) the wide\nintra-traditional disagreement about how to model what is ultimate\n(e.g., there are Hindu monisms, panentheisms and dualisms) and related\n(2) the significant inter-traditional agreement about it (e.g., there\nare Hindu, Christian, and Daoist panentheisms). The amount of\ndisagreement within a tradition makes talk about \u201cthe\nidea of Brahman\u201d or \u201cthe idea of God\u201d ambiguous, and\ncrucially so in some contexts, as indicated in\n Section 1.2.\n The amount of agreement between traditions creates strange\nbedfellows across the landscape of models\u2014strange because the\nmodelers disagree about their religious or philosophical tradition,\nbut bedfellows all the same because they agree about which\nphilosophical categories from\n Section 1.5\n best suit what is ultimate (see Diller 2013a). The existence of such\nagreement at the very heart of diverse traditions is an important\nfact.\n\nOne perplexing issue before we encounter the models is the range of\ntheir connection to a lived religious tradition. The \u201creligious\nmodels\u201d purport to provide an understanding of reality as it is\nbelieved (or held by faith) to be in a particular tradition\u2014as\nevidenced by their efforts to capture as much as they can of a\ntradition\u2019s key texts, figures, practices, symbols\netc.\u2014while \u201cphilosophical models\u201d do not do this.\nFor example, the models of the Dao in\n Section 2.3\n seem to be religious models given the regular citations of the\nDaodejing and the Zhuangzi and liturgical practices\nin explication and defense of the models. Some philosophical models\ninclude Aristotle\u2019s Unmoved Mover or divine Nous\n(Physics Bk. VIII, Metaphysics Bk. XII),\nPlato\u2019s Demiurge in the Timaeus (29\u201330) or\nPlotinus\u2019 One in the Enneads. None of these modelers\nturn to traditional sources to explain or defend their views; indeed,\nit is not even clear what traditional sources would be germane.\nPerhaps there are intermediate \u201cquasi-religio-philosophical\nmodels\u201d, e.g., Spinoza 1677 or Hegel 1832, which have some\nsalient connection with a religious tradition, either because of the\nmodel\u2019s status as a revision of a traditional model or because\nthey share some key features of ultimacy within a religious\ntradition.\n\nThe puzzle: are all these modelers modeling the same thing? This\nquestion may be just a rehash of the \u201cGod of Abraham Isaac and\nJacob\u201d vs. \u201cGod of the philosophers\u201d issue (see\n Section 2.2).\n The answer to it is yes in the vague-categorial sense that both\nphilosophical and religious models are talking about that which is\nfundamentally real, valuable or liberating, but no in the sense that\nphilosophical models are about what is ultimate per se while\nthe religious models are about what is ultimate as it appears in their\ntradition. In any case, nota bene:\n Section 2.3\n (Models of God) houses several recent philosophical models because\nthey use the term \u201cGod\u201d to name the ultimate they are\nmodeling. Perhaps they are misnamed and should be renamed models of\n\u201cthe ultimate\u201d and housed in an entirely different\nsection. Or perhaps they are rightly named \u201cGod\u201d and God\nis not dead as Nietzsche had it, but is becoming increasingly unhinged\nfrom the lived religious traditions.\n2.1 Models of Brahman\n\nThough the term \u201cHinduism\u201d and its variants was originally\na foreign imposition during the British Raj in India, they have become\nwidely used in the public realm to refer to forms of religiosity and\nspirituality that had their start in the Indus River valley at least\nsince 2000 BCE and have endured with great internal diversification\never\n since.[24]\n\nThe idea of Brahman was birthed in the Rig Veda (ca. 1000\u20131500\nBCE), was defined in the Upanishads (ca. 500 BCE), came to full flower\nin the Bhagavad-Gita (ca. 200 BCE) and the Brahmasutras (400\u2013450\nCE), and has been refined in commentaries about them for over the past\nmillennium, first by Adi Shankara (788\u2013820 BCE) and then by many\nothers after him which constitute the Vedanta system of Hindu\nphilosophy (Vedanta = \u201cend of the\n Vedas\u201d).[25]\n Vedanta has been dominant among the traditional six Hindu\nphilosophical systems for at least the last 500\n years.[26]\n\nAll the Vedanta schools agree on three things about Brahman, or\nultimacy (here is this entry\u2019s first, very general model of an\nultimate). First, Brahman\u2019s nature is essentially\nsat-chid-ananda, \u201cExistence-Consciousness-Bliss\u201d,\nwhich means that the metaphysical rock bottom of reality\nis\u2014surprise, given the phenomenal mess\u2014a blissful\nconsciousness. Second, most of the schools take Brahman to be what\nJeffery D. Long calls a \u201ctheocosm\u201d: (1) God and (2) a\ncosmos, meaning a universe/multiverse of all natural\n forms.[27]\n The original Sanskrit in the Vedantic texts is conceptually precise\nand better than what we have in the God-world relations in\n Section 1.5\n because there is a name for God and the world put together: the\ntheocosm gets called \u201cBrahman\u201d, God is\n\u201cIshvara\u201d (or \u201cNarayana\u201d or\n\u201cKrishna\u201d etc.), and the cosmos is \u201csamsara\u201d,\nand the whole thing and each part are\n eternal.[28]\n Third, the Vedanta schools all agree that their view about Brahman is\nassociated with (1) an epistemological license in direct experience,\neither in texts heard by spiritual adepts (sruti) or in\nproponents\u2019 own firsthand spiritual experience (for much more,\nsee Phillips 2019), and (2) a life expression that lives out such\nexperience and the view so deeply that it is hard to know which came\nfirst, the life expression or the metaphysical commitments that enable\nit.[29]\n\nWhat the Vedanta schools disagree about is the kind of link between\nGod and the cosmos in the theocosm. These disagreements spread them\nout in a range.\n\nOn one end is the Dvaita (dvaita = \u201ctwo\u201d) Vedanta\nschool, which is dualistic in its ultimate-world relation and\nnot far from the classical monotheistic views (model 2 in this entry).\nIt reads the theocosm to be two really distinct things, viz., God and\nthe cosmos, with no organic link between them. Though there is no\ncreation ex nihilo in Dvaita or any other Vedanta school,\nIshvara (God) is the Divine creator and sustainer of the distinct\ncosmos and ensouls it and resides within it. The ultimate is the two\neternally co-existing, like an eternal dweller eternally content to\nlive in an eternal house It built out of something other than Itself.\nOf the four traditional Hindu yogas, Dvaita is a deeply\nbhakti-oriented system (bhakti = \u201cdevotion\u201d),\ngenerally practicing devotion to Vishnu/Krishna.\n\nOn the other end of the range is the Advaita Vedanta school\n(advaita = not two) which is well-known in the West but not\nas dominant in India. It reads the theocosm/Brahman as one/non-dual,\nand takes God and the cosmos not to be really distinct, i.e., God =\nthe cosmos. The paradigmatic filling out of this view, often and\nperhaps mistakenly attributed to Shankara, is pantheistic and\n world-denying.[30]\n Specifically (here is model 3), such classical Advaitans hold that\nsince reality is one and the cosmos is many, the cosmos cannot be\nreal. It looks as if there is a cosmos filled with many\nthings, but the cosmos is merely an appearance (maya), and\ntaking it to be reality is like taking a rope at dusk to be a snake\n(Shankara\u2019s famous metaphor, see, e.g., Tapasyananda 1990: 34).\nWith the cosmos out of the picture, the theocosm is just the\n\u201ctheo\u201d part; to use the metaphor above, the\nultimate is all dweller, no house. That move makes the terms\n\u201cBrahman\u201d and \u201cGod\u201d interchangeable, and on\nit, God-Brahman is generally read as impersonal. The epistemological\nlicense in direct experience for this view is samadhi, a\nstate of spiritual absorption in which all dualities vanish and one\nexperiences just infinite bliss. Since the classical Advaitan view\ndenies the world, Anantanand Rambachan, a contemporary Advaitan, takes\nits best life expression to be that of the renunciant\n(sannyasi) who lives out that denial (2006: 69).\n\nIn the middle range between Dvaita and Advaita are a dozen subtly\ndistinct schools of mainstream Vedanta, often called the \u201cBhakti\nschools\u201d given their emphasis on devotion (the distinctions\nbetween them make a dozen distinct models here). These schools are all\npanentheistic and world-affirming. Their best representative\nis Ramanuja (ca. 1017\u20131157), the first comprehensive critic of\nShankara, who synthesized Advaita with bhakti in a system called\nVishishtadvaita (meaning \u201cnon-duality of the qualified\nwhole\u201d, model 4 for this\n entry).[31]\n Like classical Advaitans, Ramanuja takes the theocosm/Brahman to be\nnon-dual because it is all God, but unlike them, he takes the cosmos\nand the many things within it to be real and distinct from Brahman.\nHow can the ultimate be one but have parts? Ramanuja\u2019s\npanentheistic answer: the cosmic parts form an\n\u201cinseparable and integral union\u201d (aprthaksiddhi)\nwith Brahman, like the union of body and soul (sarira and\nsariri): Brahman is the cosmos\u2019 soul, and the cosmos is\nBrahman\u2019s body\u2014a body which, to use Ramanuja\u2019s\nillustration from a quote from the Upanishads,\n\n\n\u201cis born in, sustained by, and is dissolved in\nBrahman\u201d\u2026.[just] as pearls strung on a thread\u2026are\nheld as a unity without impairing their manifoldness. (Tapasyananda\n1990: 6)\n\n\nSo for Ramanuja, Brahman builds a house not out of something else as\nin Dvaita but out of Brahmanself, and eternally dwells in this eternal\nBrahman-house which (here is the mark of panentheism) depends on\nBrahman for its existence but not vice versa, i.e., (Brahman \u2192\nthe cosmos) but not (the cosmos \u2192 Brahman). Ramanuja also takes\nBrahman to be not impersonal but the Divine Person, known under\ndifferent sacred names, e.g., \u201cVishnu\u201d,\n\u201cNarayana\u201d, \u201cIsvara\u201d, etc. The moves to a real\ncosmos and divine personality have Ramanuja deciding that\nBrahman\u2019s essential nature as sat-chid-ananda is filled\nout with countless extrinsic \u201causpicious properties\u201d\n(\u201cqualities manifested in him in relation to finite\nbeings\u201d), among them some of the classical perfections such as\nomnipotence, omniscience and immutability, as well as compassion,\ngenerosity, lordship, creative power, and splendor (1990:\n36\u201337).The experiential epistemological licenses for\nVishishtadvaita are the combination of samadhi (which\njustifies the non-dual piece) and darsan (visual contact with\nthe divine through the eyes of images, which justifies the\nqualification to non-duality). Its best life expression is the\npractice of bhakti yoga, supported by the reality and personality of\nboth devotee and devoted in Ramanuja\u2019s metaphysics, and\nexemplified by the Alvars\u2019 passionate devotion to Vishnu from\nthe second to eighth century CE (Tapasyananda 1990: 33).\n\nIn the midst of this centuries-long dispute between the Dvaitans,\nAdvaitans and Bhakti schools, a key modern figure arose: Ramakrishna\n(1836\u201386), sometimes called \u201cthe Great Reconciler\u201d\nbecause he attempted to integrate all the schools into one\npluralistic, non-sectarian approach. His major insight (birthing model\n5 for this entry) is that \u201cGod is infinite, and the paths to God\nare infinite\u201d, and the schools are among these infinite paths\n(Maharaj 2018: frontispiece). Ramakrishna came by this view firsthand\nwhen, after being in a state of samadhi for six months, which\nhe said was \u201clike reaching the roof of a house by leaving the\nsteps\n behind\u201d,[32]\n he had a divine command to come down and stay in a state he called\n\u201cvijn\u0303a\u0304na\u201d (intimate knowledge),\nduring which he could see the roof but also see that \u201cthe steps\nare made of the same material as the roof (brick, lime, brick\ndust)\u201d. In other words, in vijn\u0303a\u0304na he saw\nthat Brahman is both non-dual and dual, and thus began to\naffirm the \u201cspiritual core\u201d of both schools, and\neventually of all the Hindu schools and Christian and Muslim ones, too\n(Long 2020: 166). He decided they all must be contacting different\n\u201caspects\u201d of one and the same reality, and that this\nreality thus must be deeply, indeed infinitely complex in order to\nmake such diverse experiences possible (Maharaj 2018: Chapter 1, part\n3, tenets 1 and 3; see also interpretive principle 4 and\n K422/G423).[33]\n Because he affirms the core of all schools, Ramakrishna is hard to\nclassify, but his view is probably best read as panentheistic and\nworld-affirming since he says over and over again that \u201call is\nBrahman\u201d and that Brahman \u201chas become everything\u201d,\ni.e., Brahman \u2192 the cosmos but not vice versa (Long 2020,\nespecially 163).\n\nContemporary Vedanta is alive and well. To offer just three examples:\nLong recently merged Ramakrishna\u2019s thought with\nWhitehead\u2019s to develop a Hindu process theology that offers an\nultimate unity behind the God-world relations that was missing in both\nWhitehead\u2019s and Griffin and Cobb\u2019s interpretations (see\n Section 2.2\n and Long 2013, our model 6). Ayon Maharaj has systematized\nRamakrishna\u2019s thought (no small task!) and put it into\nconversation with major Western philosophers to advance global\nphilosophical work on the problem of evil, religious pluralism and\nmystical experience (2018). Finally, Rambachan, a present-day\nAdvaitan, moves Advaita closer to Vishishtadvaita when he asserts that\n\u201cnot-two is not one\u201d (2015): non-dualism is not\npantheistic but rather panentheistic because Brahman is the\ncosmos\u2019 material and efficient\n cause;[34]\n Brahman intentionally self-multiplies to make the\n cosmos.[35]\n The cosmos is thus not maya but rather a finite\n\u201ccelebrative expression of Brahman\u2019s fullness\u201d\n(Rambachan 2006: 79). This reading (model 7 here) opens up Advaitic\ntheology to help heal a variety of human problems from low self-esteem\nto the caste system because there is real power in re-seeing people as\ninfinite-conscious-bliss, so worthy of respect (Rambachan 2015).\n\nMuch of the explicit discussion among the schools is debate over\nmetaphysical ultimacy in general and over the Brahman-God-cosmos\nrelation in particular. Still, there is an implicit drumbeat in all\nthe schools that one can find ultimate fulfillment in Brahman, whether\nthat is in a state of samadhi, vijn\u0303a\u0304na\nor devotion (e.g., the \u201cprofound and mutual sharing in the life\nof God\u2026creates unsurpassed bliss [for the devotee]\u201d, Long\n2013: 364). So Brahman seems to be soteriologically as well as\nmetaphysically ultimate. What is less clear is whether Brahman is\naxiologically ultimate, especially in the moral category of being.\nThere are suggestive phrases sprinkled through the texts in the\naffirmative, but as Alan Watts says:\n\n\nreason and the moral sense rebel at pantheistic monism which must\nreduce all things to a flat uniformity and assert that even the most\ndiabolical things are precisely God, thus destroying all values.\n(Hartshorne & Reese 1953 [2000: 325], quoting Watts 1947)\n\n\nThough this sentiment is softened by the panentheistic readings in\nseveral of the schools since the world can take the fall, in the end,\nall the schools affirm that Brahman is everything, in some sense. And\nif Brahman is everything, and not everything seems to be good, then\nBrahman seems not to be good, at least not full stop. There is no\nquestion that Brahman is still the ultimate in Vedantic schools even\nif Brahman is not axiologically ultimate; as indicated at the start,\nmetaphysical and soteriological ultimacy are sufficient for ultimacy\nwhen nothing else in a system has all three marks. But it is jarring\nand a real contribution to global thought about ultimacy to consider\ndropping axiological ultimacy from the trio: what is most deeply real\nmay not be all good, though contact with it may still manage to\nfulfill us deeply all the same.\n2.2 Models of God\n\nAs in Vedanta, the extant models of God disagree about the\nultimate-world relation and those disagreements spread them out in a\nrange, with dualisms on one end and monisms on the other, and\npanentheisms and\u2014for the first time in this\nentry\u2014merotheisms in between. The idea of God seems to be\nnothing if not flexible. Even the relatively common view that God is\nby definition a personal ultimate\u2014an ultimate that is conscious\nand self-aware\u2014has been on the move for millennia and is hotly\ndebated today.\n\nThe most venerable model of God that is often read dualistically is\nknown as \u201cperfect being theology\u201d, which bears traces of\nits origin in its name (this is model 8\u2014a general model, species\ncoming). The idea fully grown, as we have it today, defines God as\nthat which is perfect (whether personal or not), where perfection is\ntypically taken to entail being unsurpassable in power, knowledge, and\ngoodness, and several models add being immutable, impassible, a\nse, eternal, simple and necessary in some sense. Most perfect\nbeing theologians take God to have created the universe out of nothing\n(ex nihilo), and that view can be taken to entail dualism for\na variety of reasons. To offer one, as Brian Davies says, \u201cGod\nmakes things to be, but not out of anything\u201d (italics\nhis), including not out of Godself, so the cosmos is entirely fresh\nstuff\u2014a second kind of stuff, distinct from and radically\ndependent on God (2004:\n 3).[36]\n Perfect being theology was birthed during the Hellenistic era from\nthe fusing of the Jewish idea of a single God that acts in history\n(the theos in \u201cperfect being theology\u201d) with the\nGreek philosophical idea of perfect ultimacy (\u201cperfect\n being\u201d).[37]\n From the very start, there were conceptual tensions in the\ncombination: how can the God who led us out of Egypt, who hears our\nprayers and who intervenes in the world as the Jews say (Cohen 1987:\n44) also be immutable, impassible and a se as the Greeks say\n(e.g., Guthrie 1965: 26\u201339, 272\u2013279; Guthrie 1981: 254\u2013263)? This\nquestion is sometimes framed: how can \u201cthe God of Abraham, Isaac\nand Jacob\u201d be the \u201cGod of the philosophers?\u201d Even\nafter perfect being theology had passed for centuries from Judaism to\nChristianity to Islam\u2014with an important handoff in the midst by\nAnselm who amped up the Greek perfection by taking God to be that than\nwhich no greater can be conceived\u2014the great medieval theologians\nin all three faiths were still hitting up against the tensions and\nfinding ways to tamp them down. For instance, on the issue of\nanthropomorphic descriptions of God in the Bible and the Quran, both\nMaimonides and Aquinas read them as negations and said that God\n\u201cis not a body\u201d (Dorff 2013: 113; Kennedy 2013: 158) and\nboth Ibn Rushd (Averroes) and al-Ghazali parted with\n\u201ctheologians who took all these descriptions literally\u201d\nbecause \u201cbeings that have bodily form\u2026have\ncharacteristics incompatible with a perfect being\u201d (Hasan 2013:\n142).\n\nThe tensions continued into the modern era and are still felt in our\ntime. Perhaps as early as 1644, perfect being theology split into two\ncamps over them (see Davies 2004: chapter 1, and Page 2019). Both\ncamps take God to be absolutely perfect, but disagree over what it\ntakes to be perfect: \u201cclassical theists\u201d deny or weaken\nGod\u2019s personhood to save the Greek perfections such as\nimpassibility, immutability and simplicity, while \u201ctheistic\npersonalists\u201d (a species of \u201cneoclassical theists\u201d)\nconversely deny or weaken the Greek perfections to save God\u2019s\npersonhood. \u201cOpen theists\u201d (model 9 in this entry), for\nexample, are theistic personalists: they call for new readings of,\ne.g., omnipotence and omniscience and drop immutability and\nimpassibility to comport with God\u2019s desire \u201cto be in an\nongoing, dynamic relationship with us\u201d (Basinger 2013:\n264\u2013268, see also, e.g., Clark 1992; Pinnock et al. 1994;\nSanders\n 1998).[38]\n Other neoclassical theists aim merely to resolve inconsistencies\namong the perfections, as in Nagasawa\u2019s Maximal God Theism\n(2008, 2017; model 10). In addition to its old challenges, perfect\nbeing theology also hit new ones in the modern era from advances in\nscience. When it met Newtonian mechanics (and more) during the\nEnlightenment, the combination spawned \u201cdeism\u201d, the idea\nthat God set the initial conditions of the universe and then left it\nto play out on its own (model 11). Deism is a dualism because it\nassumes God can leave the world behind and thus is neither\n\u201cin\u201d it as in panentheism nor identical with it as in\npantheism. Picture all these theistic dualisms as close to Dvaita\nVedanta\u2019s image of the eternal builder building a house out of\nsomething different from itself and dwelling in it as it pleases, but\nmake the house not necessarily eternal (it may have had a start and\nmay end), and for classical theism, give the builder all the\nperfections; for neoclassical theisms, give it a few less and perhaps\nhave it throw better parties in the house; and for deism, have the\nbuilder abandon the house altogether once it is built and leave it to\nits own devices, like an \u201cabsentee landlord\u201d (Mitchell\n2008: 169).\n\nOn the other end of the spectrum from these varieties of theistic\ndualism, we find pantheism, the species of monism that takes the One\nto be God (a general model, 13). All monisms face a problem of\nunity: how are the many things in the world integrated enough\nto call them One? But pantheisms face an additional problem of\ndivinity: even if all is truly One, does the One have what it\ntakes to be God? Here we will focus on two contemporary pantheisms,\nboth in Buckareff & Nagasawa (2016): what we might call a\n\u201cone-thing\u201d pantheism by Peter Forrest (2016) (a specific\npantheism, model 14), where the One is a count noun (as in \u201ca\nwalrus is sleeping over there\u201d), so the cosmos as a whole is One\nthing, and a \u201cone-stuff\u201d pantheism by Karl Pfeifer (2016)\nwhere the One is a mass term (as in \u201cthat little lamb is made of\nbutter\u201d), so everything in the cosmos is made of the\nsame kind of One-stuff (model 15). Unlike the Advaita pantheists who\ntake the universe to be a mere appearance, Forrest and Pfeifer\ndefinitely take the universe to exist. So for them (and pantheists\nlike them), the One will have to be identical to the universe, and the\nwork is to show how the universe can be identical to God. In other\nwords, this is not all builder no house as in Advaita; the builder is\nthe house, and the builder-house is special enough to call it\n\u201cGod\u201d. Forrest\u2019s main move to effect this is to take\nthe universe to be a conscious self, by way of a \u201cproperly\nanthropocentric\u201d non-reductive physicalism: just as our brain\nprocesses correlate with our mental states, so also the\nuniverse\u2019s physical processes correlate with universal mental\nstates, which on the model involve a unity of consciousness and thus a\nsense of self. Forrest has a strong reply to the problem of unity\nhere: the One is an integrated Self precisely because of what emerges\nfrom the processes of the many. But is the Self conscious in high\nenough ways to meet the problem of divinity, to count as God? Though\nForrest does not argue like this, the resources for nascent\nperfections are here, such as omnipotence (the Self has all the power\nin the universe), omniscience (It could know the entire universe by\nbiofeedback), good will for all (since to hurt any part of the\nuniverse is to hurt Itself) etc.\u2014enough in theory to count as\nGod in the classical or at least neoclassical sense. For\nPfeifer\u2019s view, instead of picturing the universe as a person,\npicture it as an \u201cintentional field\u201d, like an\nelectromagnetic field except spread physical dispositional states\nacross space instead of magnetic forces and electrons. Because those\nphysical dispositional states have the same extension as intentional\n states,[39]\n intentional states are effectively spread everywhere too. That\nspreading means there is a kind of \u201cpanintentionalism\u201d,\nand if the intentions are divine enough, then a panGodism, i.e.,\npantheism. So if Forrest is right, the universe is God itself, and if\nPfeifer is right, the universe is made of God-stuff, this field of\ndivine intentional states\u2014both strong thoughts. How plausible,\nthough? On the plus side, Forrest\u2019s view is an instance of\n\u201ccosmopsychism\u201d (\u201cthe cosmos as a whole is\nphenomenal\u201d, i.e., the Cosmos as a whole has conscious states)\nand Pfeifer\u2019s an instance of \u201cpanpsychism\u201d\n(\u201ceverything in the cosmos is phenomenal\u201d, every\nparticular in the cosmos is conscious), both of which are receiving\ngrowing attention in philosophy of mind since, e.g., cosmopsychism may\nsolve physicalism\u2019s problem of strong emergence and\npanpsychism\u2019s combination problem at once (Nagasawa 2019, for\nmore on these views and their link with Hinduism and Buddhism see,\ne.g., Shani 2015, Albahari 2019, Mathews 2019). However, even if\neither the cosmo- or panpsychic aspect of Forrest\u2019s or\nPfeifer\u2019s views turns out to be true, the divine part seems\ndoubtful for a reason Pfeifer enunciates: the kind of intentionality\nthe universe would have within it (on Pfeifer\u2019s view) or that\nwould supervene on it (in Forrest\u2019s view) seems likely to be at\nbest the consciousness of an animal, or a comatose or schizoid human,\netc.\u2014not even close to the kind of consciousness that would make\nit count as God (see Pfeifer\u2019s footnote on 2016: 49).\n\nIn the middle, between the theistic dualisms and the pantheisms, stand\nthe merotheisms and the panentheisms (two general kinds of models, 16\nand 17, again, species coming). As indicated above, the merotheisms\nare rare, the \u201codd bird\u201d idea that God is in the world,\nbut the world goes beyond God. Though the term\n\u201cmerotheism\u201d was coined only recently by Paul Draper for\nhis own view (2019: 160), merotheisms have been around well before,\nfor example, in divine emergence theories such as Samuel\nAlexander\u2019s (1920, a specific model 18) on which the world is\nmetaphysically ultimate and God arises in\n it.[40]\n So on the metaphor, the house comes first, then God grows within it.\nAlexander, for instance, thinks the rock-bottom reality is space-time,\nand that when \u201cpatterns\u201d or \u201cgroupings\u201d of it\nbecome complex enough, matter comes to evolve in it, then life, then\nmind and then deity (257). The universe now is at mind, so we are\nwaiting for deity to emerge, not from small \u201cgroupings\u201d of\nthings as with the other levels, but from the universe as a whole.\nBecause things can think only about the things below\nthemselves in the hierarchy, we cannot know what deity will be like\nwhen it comes (Thomas 2016: 258)\u2014a nice way to explain why God\nis ineffable and unknowable, albeit one that gives no (other) content\nto say why Alexander\u2019s \u201cdeity\u201d should count as God.\nIn contrast to the emergence merotheisms, Draper (2019) offers a sheer\n\u201cmeros\u201d one (model 19), in which nature, instead of\ngrowing God, always has God as one proper part. Specifically, nature\nis composed of two parts which are both metaphysically ultimate:\nfundamental matter, and fundamental mind. So what there is not only\nall the familiar material stuff but also one and only one immaterial\nmind, i.e., God\u2014\u201cthe single subject of all phenomenally\nconscious experiences\u201d, located in and coextensive with space\n(2019: 163). Assuming that minds are the source of value, this one\nmind is the fundamental \u201csource of all the value there\nis\u201d, and hence is axiologically ultimate (2019: 163).\nInterestingly, just like prisms immersed in sunlight naturally\ndiffract the electromagnetic spectrum (2019: 167, originally from\nWilliam James), our brains, which are with everything else immersed in\nthis omnipresent universal mind, naturally diffract what we might\nthink of as the divine spectrum\u2014displaying aspects of the\nuniversal consciousness by generating one of its \u201cmultiple\nstreams\u201d, \u201cmaking use\u201d of it for our own ends,\ntuning in to it in mystical experiences, etc. (2019: 163, 170). So\nbrains don\u2019t produce consciousness\u2014they tap into\nit\u2014and God doesn\u2019t make the universe or emerge in\nit\u2014God is the mental part of it that gives it value, and gives\nus a hope for a form of life after death because the consciousness\nthat runs through our brains and that we mistakenly call our own\ncontinues to live on after the brain dies as the aspect of the\nenduring universal consciousness it always was. This hope secures some\nsoteriological ultimacy: though it makes sense to mourn our deaths, we\nshould \u201cnot despair\u201d (2019: 170) since, if we ally\nourselves with our consciousnesses, we are even after death still what\nwe always were, an aspect of the mental fundamental reality, as\nShankara and Ramakrishna and others would tell us.\n\nPanentheistic models of God (on which the world is in God but God goes\nbeyond the world) have been popular for millennia, to the point that\nJohn Cooper calls them \u201cthe other God of the Philosophers\u201d\nin the title of his book on panentheism (Cooper 2006, a general model,\n#20 in this entry). There are literally too many panentheistic models\nof God to count, from a star-studded list of historical thinkers\nincluding Plato, Pseudo-Dionysius, Ibn Arabi, Meister Eckhart,\nNicholas of Cusa, Kant, Hegel, Peirce and more, with a resurgence in\nthe last decade owing at least in part to Yujin Nagasawa and Andrei\nBuckareff\u2019s Pantheism and Panentheism Project (2017\u201319\n [see Other Internet Resources]). Though some complain\nthat the \u201cin\u201d in panentheism is so ambiguous it is not\nobviously a single view (see Gasser 2019), Chad Meister suggests that\nthe recent appeal of panentheism is a direct result of (1) some of the\nneoclassical revisions to the idea of God (more immanent, more\npassible, etc.) which can be explained by the world\u2019s being in\nGod, as well as (2) the advent of emergentist theories in science\nwhich make room not only for the emergence merotheisms sketched above\n(on which God emerges from the world) but also for their converse, the\nemergence panentheisms (on which the world emerges from God), among\nother reasons (Meister 2017: section 4).\n\nHartshorne\u2019s process theology is a great example of the first\nimpulse Meister identifies (so it is a specific panentheism, model\n21). Hartshorne\u2019s process view begins with Whitehead\u2019s\nmetaphysics from Process and Reality\u2014with the idea that\nthe world is dynamic, not static, and indeed that the fundamental\nunits are events, \u201cactual occasions\u201d, not substances,\nwhich\n\n\ndo not endure through a tiny bit of time unchanged but [take] a tiny\nbit of time to become\u2026concrete (\u201cconcresence\u201d, Cobb\n& Griffin 1976: 15)\n\n\nand which are thus dynamic all the way down. Hartshorne then places\nthis dynamic world of events in God, by taking a page from\nRamanuja\u2019s book and saying that all of it\u2014this\n\u201ctotality of individuals as a physical or spatial whole is\nGod\u2019s body, the Soul of which is God\u201d (Hartshorne\n1984: 94, quoted in Meister 2017: section 5, italics added)\u2014a\nmove which cements his view as a panentheism, since the world is\nliterally in God, but God, as Soul of the world, goes beyond the\nworld. The practical pay dirt of the view is that, in the same way we\nfeel our bodies, so also God as the Soul of the world feels the\nworld\u2014feels every last \u201cdrop of experience\u201d as\nWhitehead says, every last bit of change happening in every last\nactual occasion. Moreover, just as we respond to what we feel in our\nbodies, so also God responds to each felt occasion, and in that\ninstant does two things: runs through a catalog of all possible next\noccasions, next moves as it were, and then \u201clures the world\nforward\u201d with suggestions for the best next moves to actualize\nin the next occasion. The world can \u201clisten\u201d or not to\nthese suggestions as the next occasion concresces, and then God will\nregroup again, moment after moment after moment. This is the dynamic\nprocess of perfecting\u2014from the world to God back to the world\nagain\u2014which gives process theology its name, and makes it a kind\nof \u201cbecoming-perfect-being\u201d theology.\n\nJohn Bishop and Ken Perszyk (2016, 2017) propose a panentheism they\ncall a \u201ceuteleological conception of divinity\u201d (model 22\nhere), on which (1) divinity is the property or activity of being the\nsupreme good (\u201ceu\u201d in\n\u201ceuteleological\u201d) and (2) realizing this property or\nactivity is the point (\u201ctelos\u201d or final cause) of\nthe universe. In addition\u2014inspired by an unusual kind of\nefficient causation called \u201caxiarchism\u201d on which final\ncauses can function as efficient ones, an idea visible at least since\nPlato and having something of a revival in the last couple\ndecades\u2014Bishop and Perszyk (3) take concrete realizations of the\nsupreme good to be the efficient cause of the\n universe.[41]\n Thus, on (2) and (3), these realizations of the good are both the\nefficient and final cause of the universe, both alpha and\nomega. This model is, as its authors say, \u201cprone to be\nmet with incomprehension or blank incredulity\u201d (2017: 613): how\ncan effects in the universe be the cause the universe, and thus their\nown causes? Though Bishop and Perszyk do not answer this question in\n2016 or 2017, they do point out the eerie precedent in the Christian\ntradition, the model\u2019s home context, for efficient causes to\ndouble as final ones: Jesus is both the source and offspring of David,\nboth \u201croot and flower;\u201d Mary \u201cgives birth to her own\ncreator;\u201d the Divine word is both \u201cwithout which was not\nanything made that was made\u201d and \u201cborn late in time\u201d\n(2017: 614). They also identify the supreme good in Christianity as\nperfect love, take Jesus to have instantiated it in his person and\ntime and again in relationships, and take us to do so too when we\n\u201clove one another as he has loved us\u201d (2017: 613). Note\nsuch concrete occasions of love are per (1) literally divinity dotting\n(and hopefully eventually overrunning) the universe, and that they\ndeserve to count as divinity because they are triply ultimate:\nmetaphysically since they are the efficient and final cause of the\nuniverse; axiologically since they are the best of things, and\nsoteriologically since they are deeply fulfilling (to quote the\nBeatles, \u201call you need is love\u201d). Whether or not the\naxiarchism at its heart is a strike against euteleological theism, an\nenormous point in its favor is how profoundly it addresses the problem\nof evil: it makes God the force in nature that defuses evil instead of\nintending\n it.[42]\n\nThis section would be incomplete without at least mentioning\nTillich\u2019s \u201cground of being theology\u201d in closing\n(model 23). His view is not filed into the range of God-world\nrelations above because it is famously difficult to categorize:\nChristopher Demuth Rodkey (2013) says Tillich has been read variously\nas a panentheist, deist (i.e., dualist), and pantheist, and that it is\nin fact best to characterize him as none of the above but rather as an\n\u201cecstatic naturalist\u201d, where the Power of Being delivers\nthe naturalism (since this Power is \u201cthe power in every thing\nthat has power\u201d) and the Depth of Being delivers the ecstasy\n(persons experience this Power of Being ecstatically, as holy). This\ninterpretation tracks Tillich\u2019s method of correlative theology\nin Systematic Theology I and II: ecstasy is a \u201cstate of\nmind\u201d which is \u201can exact correlate\u201d to the\n\u201cstate of reality\u201d of the power of being which animates\nand transcends the finite world (see, e.g., Tillich 1957b: 13). So for\nTillich, God is the power or energy that animates the world which,\nwhen truly encountered, provokes ecstatic response. This view is spare\nenough that it is not obvious how someone might work up an\n\u201cultimate concern\u201d about God, another of Tillich\u2019s\ncentral ideas mentioned at the start of this entry (1957a, e.g.,\n10\u201311). Tillich will have to hypothesize that the ecstasy\nprovoked is, for believers, strong enough to rouse such a concern.\n\nThese are, then, several models of God, sorted mainly by how they see\nthe relationship between God and the world. Is the God that is modeled\nin each of these ways metaphysically, axiologically and\nsoteriologically ultimate, in Schellenberg\u2019s terms?\nInterestingly, the answers differ dramatically for each model. To\noffer just two examples, on classical theism we get a yes, yes, yes:\nGod as single-handed origin of the universe, making everything out of\nnothing, is metaphysically the fundamental fact; and, in\nAnselm\u2019s hands, God as the greatest not only actual but also\npossible being in every category of being, is as axiologically\nultimate as anything can be; and in Aquinas\u2019 idea, God as our\nvery telos, the point of our being, is soteriologically\nultimate as well. In contrast, God on Alexander\u2019s view gets a\nno, maybe, maybe. Alexander\u2019s deity is not metaphysically the\nmost fundamental fact in any of the ways collected in the models seen\nso far: it is neither the efficient cause of the universe (as in the\ndualisms), nor its material cause (as in the pantheisms and some\npanentheisms) nor its final cause (as in Bishop and\n Perszyk).[43]\n Alexander also cannot say if deity will be axiologically or\nsoteriologically ultimate when it arrives, since deity is by\ndefinition unknown for him. Thus, God as modeled in some ways is\nultimate and in others is not.\n2.3 Models of the Dao\n\nThe idea of the Dao (Way, Path, Guide) emerged during the Warring\nStates period in China (fifth to second centuries BCE), when the\nreigning idea of Tian (Heaven) as a kind of personal god or\nGod started to shatter along with the rest of the imperial structures\nof the Zhou Dynasty. Chinese thinkers faced their version of the\nproblem of evil: \u201cWhy is Tian letting this chaos\npersist?\u201d and added \u201cWhere is the dao to\nharmony?\u201d (Perkins 2019; Miller 2003: 37). An extended debate\narose among different schools of thought arguing for different answers\n(Zu\u0308rn 2018: 300ff), including two schools that have endured: the\nearly Ru (Confucian) thinkers who said the dao could be\nbrought back into the human world by reestablishing right social\nrelationships and customs, and the early or\n proto-Daoists[44]\n who found a new focus in the dao in the impersonal,\nconsistent patterns of the non-human natural world. The\nDaodejing (ca. sixth to fourth centuries BCE, hereafter\n\u201cDDJ\u201d) is the earliest Daoist text that reads\nthese natural patterns as evidence of a single force or principle of\nall that there is\u2014as a single metaphysical ultimate\u2014and\n\u201ctentatively\u201d, as Perkins (2019) says well, names this\nultimate \u201cthe dao\u201d or in some translations\n\u201cthe Dao\u201d or \u201cDao\u201d. Though\nthis entry will focus mainly on the Daoist tradition and use the word\n\u201cDao\u201d (hereafter not italicized) to refer to it, the\nres in question runs under other important names and concepts\nin both the Daoist and Ru traditions, including Taiji (Great\nUltimate or Grand One), Xuan Tian (Dark Heaven),\nZhen (Truth or noumenal Reality) and conjoined with\nTian as Tiandao in Ruism.\n\nGradually, the early Daoist thinkers took the Dao to have multiple\nfunctional roles\u2014metaphysically, as the cosmos\u2019 origin,\nits pattern or structure (ti), its functioning\n(yong); and soteriologically as a guide through the cosmos\nfor humans, as Robin Wang says (DDJ ch. 25, Wang 2012: 47).\nCombining the Dao\u2019s role as the origin of all things with its\nundeniable unitariness threw Daoist thinkers into the question of how\nthe One became Many, and thus into a focus on cosmogony. The Daoist\ncosmogonists generally agreed, and agree now, on at least six things\nabout the Dao (the last general model this entry will\nshowcase)\u2014though there is substantial diversity in\ninterpretations of each which help constitute various thinkers\u2019\nmodels of the Dao.\n\nFirst, in a seeming nod to the consistent patterns of the universe\nthat encouraged postulation of the Dao in the first place, the Dao is\ntaken to be immanent in everything. As the Zhuangzi says,\n\n\nThere\u2019s no place [the Dao] doesn\u2019t exist\u2026.It is in\nthe panic grass\u2026.in the tiles and shards\u2026in the piss and\nshit!\u2026\u201cComplete\u201d, \u201cuniversal\u201d,\n\u201call-inclusive\u201d\u2014all point to a single reality.\n(Zhuangzi, sec. 22, Watson translation)\n\n\nSecond, because it is capable of singlehandedly originating\neverything, the Dao is taken to be necessarily ziran, meaning\n\u201cself-so\u201d or \u201cspontaneous\u201d, which is read as\nentailing something like the kind of necessity and aseity of being\ncausa sui in the Thomist tradition (Perkins 2019). Wang\nexplains the entailment in her explication of a famous passage\n(\u201cHuman beings follow earth, earth follows heaven, heaven\nfollows dao, and dao follows ziran\u201d):\nthe Dao\u2019s following ziran arrests the regress because\n\u201cfollowing\u201d spontaneity is the opposite of following since\nspontaneity is making it up yourself on the fly (DDJ, ch. 25;\nWang 2012: 51).\n\nWhat is the nature of a ziran generator of all things, then?\nZhuangzi answers in his inimitable way: \u201cwhat things things is\nnot itself a thing\u201d (ch. 11, see Schipper 1982 [1993: 115]). In\nother words, the third commonly held claim is that the Dao is no\nthing, nothing, nonbeing (wu). Bin Song (2018) helpfully\ndisambiguates several readings of nonbeing, including as (a) sheer\nnothingness, a great vacuum \u201cbefore\u201d time and things; or\n(b) abstract forms not yet made concrete, e.g., Zhu-Xi\u2019s\n\u201cpattern-principles\u201d or Wang\u2019s \u201cpatterns and\nprocesses of interrelatedness\u201d (2018: 48) or, instead of\nnothingness or abstractness, (c) concrete no-thingness, i.e., a\ntotally undetermined whole of being, stuff without form. Song and Poul\nAndersen favor option (c), translating a key phrase in DDJ 21\nthat describes the Dao as a \u201ccomplete blend\u201d and as having\n\u201cmurky indistinctness\u201d, respectively (Song 2018:\n224\u2013230, Andersen 2019: 131\u2013132). Another line in that\nchapter also tells against the Dao\u2019s being sheer\nnothingness:\n\n\nyet within it is a substance, within it is an essence, quite genuine,\nwithin it, something that can be tested. (DDJ, Lau\ntranslation)\n\n\nOn any of these readings of nonbeing, it is clear why the Dao is taken\nto be impersonal: the Dao is not only not anthropomorphic; it is not\neven thingmorphic. It is also clear why it is taken to be ineffable:\nit is not just because its being is beyond us; it is also because it\nis not a being at all, and most uses of words (to talk like Zhuangzi)\nthing it. So we find Daoist texts using the tricks of the ineffability\ntrade to talk about the Dao, including famously, e.g., a use of the\nvia negativa in the opening line of the DDJ:\n\u201cthe way that can be spoken of is not the constant\nway\u2026\u201d Also, in an expression that is perhaps less about\nthe Dao\u2019s ineffability and more about the futility of finding it\nintellectually, there is Zhuangzi\u2019s dynamic semper\nnegativa of \u201ccontinuous self-negation\u201d or\n\u201cunsaying\u201d, visible also in the Buddhist tradition and in\nTillich millennia after and oceans away:\n\n\nThere is being, there is no-being, there is not yet beginning to be\nno-being, there is not yet beginning to be not yet beginning to be\nno-being. (Zhuangzi, sec. 2; on Tillich, Rodkey 2013:\n491\u2013493)\n\n\nThe fourth and fifth widely held views of the Dao are both about how\nnonbeing generates being, namely with wu wei\n(\u201cnon-action\u201d), and in stages. Andersen describes wu\nwei more fully: \u201cthe Way does not cause [things] to come\ninto being but provides a gap that allows things to emerge\u201d\n(2019: 131). To reveal wu wei, Daoist literature frequently\nuses images of the female and infants, e.g., twice over in\nDDJ 10, where wu wei is likened first to\n\u201ckeeping the role of the female\u201d who with no apparent\n(anyway) action naturally nurtures the fetus and then, to use\nAndersen\u2019s words, provides a gap to allow it to emerge in birth;\nand second to \u201cbeing as supple as a babe\u201d who is the\nepitome of the wu wei ruler since a baby does not do anything\nbut gets everyone else to act to please it (Zu\u0308rn in\nconversation; see also Erkes and Ho-Shang-Kung1945: 128).\n\nThe Dao is also taken to generate in stages, and actually in four of\nthem (DDJ 40, 42; Perkins 2019; Robson 2015: 1483; Wang 2012:\n48; etc.). There are various readings of the sequence, but one\nprominent view takes 0 as nonbeing, the Dao; 1 as unity, Being; 2 as\nduality,\n yinyang;[45]\n and 3 as multiplicity, namely heaven, earth and human beings. In a\nprescient recognition of how natural (heaven and earth) and social\n(human) constructions combine to make reality, 3 burgeons into 4,\ni.e., the 10,000 or myriad things that comprise the universe.\nCrucially, 4 returns to 0\u2014to use the feminine imagery, returns\nto the womb where everything is possible and everything\ndevelops\u2014and then the sequence repeats (Pregadio 2016 [2020:\nsec. 4], Wang 2012, 51 citing the Huainanzi). This\nworld-to-Dao-and-back cycle is reminiscent of the\noccasion-to-God-and-back cycle in process theology, though on a grand\nvs. momentary\n scale.[46]\n\nInterestingly, in general, Daoists read the sequence as strictly\ncyclical (so 4 returns to 0, i.e., 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 0, 1, \u2026) while\nRuists read it as an \u201cendless advance to novelty\u201d so that\nwe never step into the same cycle twice (i.e., 0, 1, \u2026, 0\u2032,\n1\u2032, \u2026, 0\u2033, 1\u2033, \u2026 etc.) (Song 2018:\n230\u2013232). Moreover, there is an open question whether the\nsequence is temporal or ontological (Song 2018: 225\u2013226) which\nis sometimes crystallized into a debate about whether 0 is temporally\n(and thus ontologically) prior to 1 or merely ontologically so. If the\nmove from 0 to 1 is temporal, then 0 happens before 1 and they are\nreally distinct; as Andersen argues:\n\n\nthe One is a product of the Way, not the Way itself\u2026 [because]\nidentity and stability as a thing in the world depends on being one.\n(Andersen 2019: 180)\n\n\nIf, on the other hand, 0 is only ontologically prior to 1, then\nnonbeing and being are always co-existing as two eternal aspects of\nwhat there is, with being still depending for its existence on\nnon-being like a burning eternal candle depends for its existence on\nits eternal flame. The ontological-only reading seems licensed by\nDDJ 1 which talks about \u201cthe nameless [who] was the\nbeginning of heaven and earth\u201d and \u201cthe named [who] was\nthe mother of the myriad creatures\u2026.these two are the same\nbut diverge in name as they issue forth\u201d (italics mine, for\nmore see Pregadio 2016 [2020: sec. 4.1])\u2014assuming that the\npassage implies that they diverge in name \u201conly\u201d. The\ndispute about how nonbeing and being relate is vexing enough that it\nis a relief, actually, when DDJ 81 throws up its hands and\nsays: \u201ctheir coexistence is a mystery\u201d!\n\nGrasping all this together\u2014that the Dao is the origin of all,\nimmanent in all, ziran, essentially nonbeing, generating\nforms of being by wu wei, generating stage by stage until we\nreach the roiling boil of being in the myriad things\u2014we are able\nto catch the last and perhaps deepest thought of all about the Dao:\nthat it is generative by nature, or as Neville says: \u201cnonbeing\nis simply fecund from the perspective of being\u201d (2008: 3). This\nidea hails back to the I Ching, which takes \u201cthe\nfoundation of the changes\u201d to be sheng sheng, literally\nmeaning \u201clife life\u201d or \u201cgenerating\ngenerating\u201d, sometimes glossed with the phrase shengsheng\nbuxi \u201cgenerating generating never\nceasing!\u201d\u2014held as the highest metaphysical principle by\nRuists (especially neo-Ruists) and not far from Spinoza\u2019s\nnatura naturans (Gao Heng 1998: 388 cited in Perkins 2019).\nThus, at the bottom of it all, there is just endless, unformed,\nspontaneous life stuff, which is generating increasingly formed\nspontaneous life stuff which, because it is shot through with the Dao,\nin turn generates even more, even further formed, spontaneous life\nstuff, and we are off and running to the 10,000 things, until, as yang\nwanes to yin, life life goes back to 0 (death death?), and all is\nstill until it waxes to yang again. In spite of the cycle that always\nsends it back to yin, it is fitting to call the Dao \u201clife\nlife\u201d because it always waxes to life again; the life force is\nirrepressible, no matter how many times it temporarily dies.\n\nThough the Daoist literature does not use these philosophical\ndistinctions much, and though occasionally it is read there as a\nmonism in passing, the standard model of the Dao just recounted is\nbest understood as an impersonal panentheism\u2014as are the\nclassical theisms and Bishop and Perszyk\u2019s model of God\n (Section 2.2).\n The Dao-world relation has the asymmetry that defines panentheism:\nall the forms of being at 1\u20134 (or at least 2\u20134, if Being\nis read as identical to the Dao) depend for their existence on the\nDao, but the Dao does not depend on them, or anything, for its\n existence.[47]\n In addition, if we take the theme of immanence in a full-throated way\nso that really there is nowhere down the line of the stages that the\nDao is not, then the Dao is both the efficient and material cause of\nthe universe, as we saw in the Bhakti Vedanta views. So the view of\nthe Dao traced here is close to the idea of Brahman as the builder of\na house out of Brahmanself, who eternally dwells in this eternal\nBrahman-house which depends on Brahman for its existence but not vice\nversa. But \u201cbuilder\u201d is too intentional for the Dao, and,\nat least on the temporal reading of the sequence, there is no eternal\nhouse and thus no eternal dwelling in it. So try this: think of the\nDao as an eternal seed for a house. The seed sprouts naturally in\nstages into a house filled with 10,000 things which depends on the\nseed but not vice versa, until the house dies back into the seed,\nwhich then lies dormant, pregnant with being, until it sprouts into\nbeing again, and so on, eternally.\n\nAfter all that has been said, the Dao is clearly metaphysically\nultimate in Schellenberg\u2019s sense: it is \u201cthe most\nfundamental fact about the nature of things\u201d (2016: 168). The\nDao is soteriologically ultimate as well, but, as with Brahman, it is\nnot clearly axiologically so. Regarding axiology, first, if we\nunderstand axiology as greatness along all the categories of being, we\ncan see immediately that the Dao, at least understood as 0, has\ngreatness along no category of being since it is not being at all (for\nmore see Kohn 2001:\n 18).[48]\n Moreover, if we narrow the idea of axiology just to the moral\ncategory of being, the Dao is still not axiologically ultimate. In\nmultiple texts, the Dao is taken to be neither good nor bad; it is\ntaken to be what is. Famous among them is DDJ, ch. 5\n(\u201cHeaven and earth are not kind, they treat the ten thousand\nbeings as straw dogs\u201d, see also chs. 18, 62). Interpreters take\nthese passages to mean that the Dao is either amoral\u2014as\nnonbeing, not the kind of thing that has moral interests in the first\nplace; or \u201cvalue-contrarian\u201d (Hansen 2020); or, to add a\nthought, perhaps \u201cananthropocentric\u201d, having moral\nconcerns that are not human-centered (see Mulgan 2015 and 2017). Wang\nBi\u2019s commentary on the straw dogs passage suggests that these\namoral or anti-moral moments spring from the Dao\u2019s and the\nsage\u2019s wu wei:\n\n\nThe one who is kind necessarily creates and erects, impacts and\ntransforms. He shows mercy and acts. If someone creates and erects,\nimpacts and transforms things, then these things lose their true\nreality. If he shows mercy and acts, then these things are not\nentirely there. (quoted in Andersen 2019: 130)\n\n\nIn other words, acting wu wei actually requires not being\nkind in the usual sense. But if Wang Bi is right, maybe there is an\naxiology after all to treating the myriad things like straw dogs:\nbeing kind in the traditional sense may not be being kind deeply since\nit destroys a thing\u2019s power to be itself.\n\nRegarding soteriology, it is agreed that a\u2014or even\nthe\u2014central goal of Daoist practices such as inner alchemy,\nt\u2019ai chi, etc. is to return to the Dao (fandao,\nhuandao, DDJ 16 and 40; Andersen 2019: 126), and\nspecifically to return to nonbeing, which is the Dao at its most\ncreative, powerful and sublime, on the crest of becoming being (Song\n2018: 234\u20135). If we can return to 0, we embody this power and\nsublimity in human form and, as Andersen says, also do our part to\nreturn the cosmos to the start for a new beginning (2019: 123). There\nare specific rituals Daoists do in communal contexts to return. In one\nof the important rites in Daoist liturgy called bugang\n(\u201cwalking along the guideline\u201d), a Daoist high priest\nwalks through the ritual space, with the audience making their own\noccasional movements too, to embody a complete motion of return with a\nsuccessful arrival back to 0 by the end of the rite, when\n\n\nthe forces that animated the universe at the beginning of time may\nonce again be channeled into the community on behalf of which the\nritual is performed. (2019: 118\u2013123)\n\n\nPractitioners outside of ritual contexts also try to return by\ninwardly cultivating the skill of acting as the Dao does when it\ngenerates being: with wu wei. Miller reminds us that wu\nwei is not some loose form of letting go, but is rather a\nspecific \u201cspiritual technology\u201d of intervening very gently\nat the right time, in the right place\u2014as Neville says, with\n\u201ca subtle infinitesimal dose\u201d when there is a rare\n\u201copening for spontaneity [in the otherwise hard-to-beat]\ninertial forces of the Dao\u201d (Miller 2003: 140; Neville 2008:\n47\u201351). Andersen\u2019s take on these efforts is haunting:\n\n\nAn accomplished Daoist resides in the gap between being and nonbeing.\nThe fundamental truth of Daoism is in this gap, in the Way and its\nmanifestation as true and real. (2019: 130)\n\n\nThis thought suggests an answer to the puzzle that surfaced about\nBrahman\u2014about why contact with a metaphysical ultimate that is\nnot axiologically so might still be fulfilling to us. At least for\nthose seeking awareness of Brahman and harmony with the Dao, our whole\ndesire looks like it is to be in the presence of what is true and real\n(Zhen), whether what is true and real is bad or good or\nneither or both. We are fans of unvarnished reality.\n3. Responses to the Diversity of Models of What is Ultimate\n\nAfter surveying these many models of Brahman, God, and the Dao, and\nrecognizing that they are just a small sample of the range of options\nfor modeling Brahman, God, and the Dao, which are in turn a small\nsample of the range of ultimates that could be modeled, one may\nwonder: What should one do with all this information?\n\nPeople respond in various ways after grasping the diversity of the\nmodels. Some abandon the models altogether, either exhausted by their\ncomplexity (embodied in Watt\u2019s wonderful phrase \u201cthe which\nthan which there is no whicher\u201d, 1972: 110), or convinced by\ntheir number and inconsistency that some models logically must be\nmaking a mistake, and it will be very hard to tell which ones. In\nother words, one response to the diversity is to decide more deeply\nthat the nature of what is ultimate is indeed beyond us, if there is\nanything ultimate at all, so it is not worth thinking about it.\n\nIn sharp contrast, others actually embrace the diversity of models as\npart of the path to understanding what is ultimate. The comparative\ntheologians, for example, study novel models in order to carry fresh\ninsights from them back to their own tradition and re-see their own\nmodels more deeply (see Clooney 2010 for an introduction and, e.g.,\nFeldmeier 2019 for the method applied to Buddhist and Christian models\nof the ultimate). An emerging movement, Theology Without Walls (TWW),\ndraws on the models to understand the nature of a globally shared\nultimate, one to which all the models may be intending to refer,\nreading the body of models as data and their number and\ninconsistencies as an interpretive challenge instead of a deal breaker\n(see, e.g., Martin 2020). Ramakrishna offers one such interpretation\nin the TWW spirit: he decides there is no need to choose between the\nmodels because each is a finite start on the \u201cinfinite paths to\nan infinite reality\u201d (see\n Section 2.1)\u2014each\n is news about an ultimate whose nature is so full that we actually\nneed all the models to help us see it. Both TWW and Ramakrishna will\nhave to explain how it is possible for many or all the models to\ndeliver news of what is ultimate given their inconsistency, e.g., by\nrelying on perspectivalism, a phenomenal/noumenal distinction, the\nmodels\u2019 incommensurability, etc. (see Ruhmkorff 2013 for a\nsurvey of options).\n\nOthers fall somewhere between abandoning and embracing the plurality\nof models by recommending that we hold the models loosely somehow,\nthat we attenuate our commitment to them. Kierkegaard for instance\ntells us to move our focus from the content of our model to our\norientation to what we are attempting to model: it is better to pray\nto a false God truly than to a true God falsely (paraphrase of 1846,\nPart Two, Chapter II).[49] \n Similarly, J.R. Hustwit cautions us to\n\u201cbalance engagement with non-attachment\u201d to models to\navoid ego-reinforcement and more (2013: 1003\u20131007)\u2014not far\nperhaps from Zhuangzi\u2019s and Tillich\u2019s semper\nnegativa of holding and letting go model after model, a view\nwhich converts the pile of models into grist for the mill of a\nspiritual practice. For his part, Schellenberg suggests that instead\nof having faith in a specific model of, e.g., Brahman, God or the Dao,\nwe do better to have it in the more general thing (res) that\nunderlies them all\u2014the axiological, soteriological, and\nmetaphysical ultimate which has been the organizing principle of this\nentry. One advantage of reading ultimacy in Schellenberg\u2019s way\nis that the general ultimate is more likely to exist than any of the\nparticular ultimates it covers, since it exists if any of them\n do.[50]\n A second advantage is that Schellenberg\u2019s general ultimate is\nby design the core, the overlooked \u201cheart\u201d of the many\nmodels\u2014the same thing that the particular models it covers are\nabout, just at a higher level of description. So faith in\nSchellenberg\u2019s ultimate permits a \u201cfaith without\ndetails\u201d (2009: ch. 2) in many of the world\u2019s religions\nand philosophies at once.\n\nFor those who, after this long journey through the landscape of models\nand now these responses to them, still hope to discover which model is\nphilosophically the best of them all, know that Wildman (2017) has a\nplan for \u201cthink[ing] our way through the morass\u201d (2017:\nviii). In brief:\n\nidentify the models worth your time;\nplace them in a \u201creverent competition\u201d that scores\nthem on \u201ccomparative criteria\u201d (2017: viii\u2013ix, ff.),\nthen\nadopt the winner, at least provisionally, since the entire inquiry\nis \u201cfallibilist\u201d (2017: 161 and elsewhere).\n\n\nWildman demonstrates his plan by following it himself (2017).\nInterestingly, he frames his options for step 1 in terms of\n\u201centire systems of thought\u201d comprised of combinations of\nmodels of what is ultimate (which he calls \u201cU types\u201d) plus\n\u201contological cosmologies\u201d (\u201cC types\u201d)\u2014an\nidea which may really do a better job of identifying our choices than\nthe models per se do, given their fuller capture of an entire\nworldview. His U types include agential models on which the ultimate\nis personal, ground of being models on which it is impersonal, and\n\u201csubordinate deity\u201d models such as process theology on\nwhich it is \u201cdisjoint:\u201d one or more personal deities\noperate in an impersonal ultimacy (2017: 13, 165, 182). His C types\ninclude supernaturalism, which involves disembodied agency;\nnaturalism, which does not; and monism. Combining the U and C types\nproduces nine U + C views, and to live out step 1 of his plan, he\nchooses his top three to place in competition: supernaturalist\ntheistic personalism (God as a personal perfect being), naturalist\nground of being (think, e.g., the panentheistic impersonal Dao), and\nWhitehead\u2019s or Hartshorne\u2019s process theism. For step (2),\nhe then subjects these three views to his comparative criteria, which\ninclude coherence, ability to handle the problems of evil and the One\nand the Many, fit with the sciences, and most importantly\nnon-anthropomorphism, his main criterion since he takes\nanthropomorphism to result from misapplying human cognitive structures\nthat were naturally selected for mere survival purposes to ideas of\nultimacy (2017: 217).\n\nWhen Wildman ran his competitors against these criteria, the\nnaturalist ground of being system won. But it is obviously up to each\nof us interested in such a project to run our own competitions on the\nmodels we take to be worth our time, with comparative criteria we\nthink make a model truth-conducive, in order to light on the most\nphilosophically satisfying model of what is ultimate that we can. That\nmodel would be the one to then subject to the best arguments for and\nagainst the existence of God and other ultimates, to discover in a\nfully researched and now clarified way, whether there is anything\nultimate.\n",
