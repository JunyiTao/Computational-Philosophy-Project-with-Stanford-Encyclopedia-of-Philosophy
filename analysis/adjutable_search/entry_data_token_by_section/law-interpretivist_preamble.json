    "main_text": "\n\n\nInterpretivism about law offers a philosophical explanation of how\ninstitutional practice\u2014the legally significant actions and\npractices of political institutions\u2014modifies legal rights and\nobligations. Its core claim is that the way in which institutional\npractice affects the law is determined by certain principles that\nexplain why the practice should have that role. Interpretation of the\npractice purports to identify the principles in question and thereby\nthe normative impact of the practice on citizens\u2019 rights and\nresponsibilities.\n\n\nInterpretivism is famously associated with Ronald Dworkin, who\ndeveloped the position in a number of publications spanning 45 years\n(see the works of Dworkin cited in the Bibliography). Dworkin\u2019s\nwritings have stimulated a great deal of debate (the following are\nsome examples from the vast secondary literature: Mitchell 1983; Cohen\n1984; Hart 1994 (Postscript); Raz 1972, 1986, 1994: Chapters 10 and\n13, 2001; Finnis 1992; Coleman 2001b; Brink 2001; Burley\n2004; Hershovitz\n2006a; Ripstein 2007; Shapiro 2007; Smith 2010; Gardner 2012; Greenberg 2014; Hershovitz 2015). In this entry, we shall focus on the explanation\nof the position that was developed and defended by Dworkin (though not\nnecessarily on his way of presenting or defending it).\n",
