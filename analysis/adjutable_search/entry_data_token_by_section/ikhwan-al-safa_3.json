    "main_text": "The extant corpus\n4. The extant corpus\n\nThe encyclopedia consists of 52 treatises divided into four sections\non the introductory (al-riy\u00e2diyya), natural,\npsycho-rational and metaphysical-theological sciences.\n\nTwo additional Epistles, entitled \u201cComprehensive Epistle\u201d\n(al-Ris\u00e2la al-J\u00e2mi\u2018a) and\n\u201cSupercomprehensive Epistle\u201d (Ris\u00e2la\nJ\u00e2mi\u2018a al-J\u00e2mi\u2018a) are thought to complete\nthe corpus and explain its esoteric (hidden) meanings. Two\nversions of the J\u00e2mi\u2018a are extant. One is\ncurrently ascribed to al-Majr\u00eet\u00ee, the Spanish scientist\nand astronomer who is alleged to have transmitted the Epistles to\nSpain. Godefroid de Callata\u00ff (2014, 200) identifies this\npersonage with Maslama al-Qurtub\u00ee (see above). The other is\nascribed to Ahmad ibn \u2018Abd All\u00e2h ibn Muhammad ibn\nIsm\u00e2\u2018\u00eel ibn Ja\u2018far al-S\u00e2diq, the second\nof the three \u201cveiled\u201d (mast\u00fbr)\nim\u00e2ms who were intermediate between Muhammad ibn\nIsm\u00e2\u2018\u00eel and \u2018Abd All\u00e2h, the founder of\nthe Fatimid dynasty. Recent studies on aspects of this work by\nBaffioni (2011b, 2012). According to De Smet, however, the existence\nof the im\u00e2m Ahmad is not grounded on any reliable\nhistorical evidence (De Smet 2017, 154\u2013155). The attribution of\nthe Ras\u00e2\u2019il Ikhw\u00e2n al-Saf\u00e2\u2019 and\nof Ris\u00e2la al-J\u00e2mi\u2018a to one of the\n\u201chidden im\u00e2m\u201d would also be a late forgery\ndating not beyond the 13th century (De Smet 2017, 157 and\n160). The Ris\u00e2la J\u00e2mi\u2018a\nal-J\u00e2mi\u2018a is also (Tamir s.d., 18) ascribed to Ahmad,\nwhich strengthens the link of the corpus with the\nIsm\u00e2\u2018\u00eeli tradition. While one cannot deny formal and\nsubstantial relationship between the encyclopedia and the\n\u201cComprehensive\u201d Epistle, the\n\u201cSupercomprehensive\u201d Epistle is never cited in the\nRas\u00e2\u2019il, and it has been recognized by\nKacimi 2015, 331 as an outcome of the Ism\u00e2\u2018\u00eelization\nof the Ikhwanian corpus. Hamdani 2008 hypothesizes a more recent\ncompilation for the Ris\u00e2la al-J\u00e2mi\u2018a. At\npresent, scholars take the study of the manuscript tradition of this\ntext, including an inquiry into its use and evidence in\nIsm\u00e2\u2018\u00eeli literature, to be an urgent task. \n\nEach Epistle starts by stating its particular goal. All of them\ncontain a core of technical teachings and a conclusion regarding the\nhaq\u00eeqa, the inner meaning of the contents. The texts\ncontain frequent invocations to the learning \u201cbrethren\u201d\n\u2013 that is, the elect who are studying the sciences \u2013 that\nenhance their didactical and exhortative style; these invocations mean\nthat the students will be awakened \u201cfrom the sleep of matter and\nthe negligence of ignorance\u201d if they apply themselves\nassiduously to study \u201cwith the assistance\n(ta\u2019yyid) of a spirit coming by God.\u201d\n\nThe Epistles vary in length and their style is plain. There are,\nhowever, numerous ambiguities, due to language and vocabulary, often\nof Persian origin, and to mistakes in the transmission of the text.\nBausani (1978, 11) thinks the authors were of Persian origin (cf. now\nHamdani, Soufan 2019, 5). In general, however, the doctrines are fully\nand clearly exposed, with repetitions where necessary to the didactic\nfunction of the treatises.\n\nDiwald (1975, 12\u201315) has even wondered whether there were in\nfact several authors of the encyclopedia because of the use at times\nof the first person singular. The basic question, of course, is\nwhether the authors unify the doctrines of more numerous groups, as\nsuggested by the different contexts and even their\ninconsistencies.\n\nThe Ikhwanian encyclopedia is typical of the changes in Greek science\nand philosophy during the tenth century as a result of the increasing\nSh\u00ee\u2018a influence. In the ninth century and at the\nbeginnings of the tenth century, the prominent philosopher Ab\u00fb\nY\u00fbsuf Ya\u2018q\u00fbb b. Ish\u00e2q al-Kind\u00ee (d. ca.\n870) had already developed single philosophical doctrines (e.g. in\ncosmology or psychology; an examination of the contents of Epistle 41\nOn definition and descriptions in the light of\nal-Kind\u00ee\u2019s treatise with the same title is made by\nPoonawala in Baffioni, Poonawala 2017, 277 ff.). Though elaborating\nthem in an original way, al-Kind\u00ee had not tried to combine such\ndoctrines with the basics of Muslim faith. Theological considerations\nremain parallel with philosophical issues. The physician Muhammad ibn\nZakariyy\u00e2\u2019 al-R\u00e2z\u00ee (d. ca. 925), mainly\ninterested to natural philosophy, had even questioned the legitimacy\nof prophecy.\n\nAt the time of al-F\u00e2r\u00e2b\u00ee (d. 950), ancient knowledge\nwill be considered as an organic whole \u2013 not only a sum of\ntheoretical elaborations, but as a real encyclopedia of sciences. It\nshould provide at every level, from the most elementary to the most\ncomplex, the necessary premises for the acquisition of ultimate\nknowledge \u2013 the knowledge of God. Then, authentically Muslim\nthought \u2013 religious in the strict sense \u2013 begins with the\nsubstitution of the schemes of Greek philosophy for those of the\nSacred Text. This is what I. Netton (1989) defined as \u201cthe\nprogressive estrangement from the Qur\u2019anic Creator\nParadigm.\u201d Ancient knowledge is the basis on which the\npatrimony of faith is built: sciences are significant not merely in\nthemselves so much as a partial reflection of the single and unique\ndivine Being. See Heck (2008, 2002) for interesting articles that\nfocus on both the Ikhw\u00e2n\u2019s and\nal-F\u00e2r\u00e2b\u00ee\u2019s \u2018willingness to turn to\nphilosophy to explain religion and trace its boundaries.\u2019\n\nThe sense of truly \u201cMuslim\u201d science is largely a product\nof the ideological commitment of the authors. Consequently, scholars\narrived to consider the Ikhw\u00e2n al-Saf\u00e2\u2019 as\nrepresentatives of a \"humanistic approach\" to Islam (e.g., Albert\nReyna 2007). This view, however, is challenged by their attitude, to\nsee the ultimate goal of their gnosiological experience as an attempt\nof separating the soul from the ties of matter and purifying it to\nachieve happiness in the hereafter (see also Reymond 2012, 126;\nRaymond 2014, 150). For them, purification can be reached by following\nprophetic revelation with the help of reason. Certainly, the study of\nancient sciences is not viewed, as by \"orthodox theologians\", as a\nvehicle of heresy and even atheism. Rather, sciences explain the\nunderlying reality of the universe and so allow rational understanding\nof the contents of Revelation and of religious Law. As Reymond (2012,\n143) puts it, the Brethren's intellectual attitude demonstrates \"une\nmentalit\u00e9 en construction,\" announcing \"une avanc\u00e9e\ndans une mentalit\u00e9 forg\u00e9e par le terminus ad\nquem pr\u00e9visible d'une autorit\u00e9 du dogme achronique\net ind\u00e9passable.\"\n\nThe blending of scientific and religious issues is evident from the\nbeginning in the encyclopedia. Sciences should be the main topic in\nthe first and the second sections and, partially, in the third, and\ntheology in the rest of the corpus. In spite of the fact that\nancient texts are always quoted with great accuracy from a\nphilological point of view, the Ikhw\u00e2n deeply rework the Greek\nsources in line with their goals that are completely different from\nthose of the ancients. Thus religion should not be underestimated in\norder to attain the best comprehension of its various contents and\nreal aims.\n",
