    "main_text": "The Bare Theory and Extensions || Many Histories\n8.3 Many Histories and Bohmian Mechanics\n\nOn the standard sort of many-worlds theory, worlds are taken to split\nover time as new branches are produced in measurement-like\ninteractions. As we have seen, inasmuch as each possible measurement\noutcome is in fact recorded by some future copy of the\nobserver one of the post-measurement branches, one problem with this\nis that the forward-looking probability of an observer getting each\nquantum-mechanically possible outcome for a measurement is simply one.\nOne way to get the right forward-looking probabilities, the standard\nprobabilistic predictions of quantum mechanics, is to postulate worlds\nare characterized by complete histories and never branch. If one\ninhabits such a world, then one simply experiences its history.\n\nThe idea is closely related to many-history tradition. Gell-Mann and\nHartle (1990) characterized Everett\u2019s theory as one that\ndescribes many, mutually decohering, histories. On this sort of\ntheory, one might think of each physically possible trajectory through\nthe Everett branches as a thread that defines a world. See Dowker and\nKent (1996) for critical examination of the consistent histories\napproach and Barrett (1999) for a characterization of such\n\u201cmany-threads\u201d theories as a type of hidden-variable\ntheory.\n\nOne can see how a many-threads theory might provide ordinary\nforward-looking probabilities by considering how one might construct\nsuch a theory from the many-minds theory. For each full trajectory\nthat a particular mind might take through the Everett branches,\nassociate a single, non-splitting world that implements the events\nexperienced along that trajectory. What the mind would see, then, is\nwhat in fact happens in the corresponding world. In this way each mind\ndetermines the history of a non-branching world.\n\nNow consider the probability measure over the set of all such worlds\ndetermined by the many-minds probability associated with each full\nhistory. A many-threads theory would stipulate this measure as the\nprior epistemic probability of each possible non-branching world in\nfact being ours. These prior probabilities are then updated as we\nlearn more about the actual history of the world we inhabit. Since\nsuch worlds and everything in them have perfectly ordinary\ntrans-temporal identities, there is no problem accounting for\nforward-looking probabilities. The forward-looking probability for a\nfuture event is just the epistemic probability that the event in fact\noccurs in the world we inhabit.\n\nA no-collapse hidden-variable theory like Bohmian mechanics can also\nbe thought of as a many-threads theory. The close relationship between\nsuch hidden variable theories and this sort of many-world theory is\ninstructive.\n\nOn Bohmian mechanics the wave function always evolves in the usual\ndeterministic way, but particles are taken to always have fully\ndeterminate positions. For an \\(N\\)-particle system, the particle\nconfiguration can be thought of as being pushed around in\n\\(3N\\)-dimensional configuration space by the flow by the probability\nassociated with the wave function just as a massless particle would be\npushed around by a compressible fluid. Here both the evolution of the\nwave function and the evolution of the particle configuration are\nfully deterministic. Quantum probabilities are the result of the\ndistribution postulate. The distribution postulate sets the initial\nprior probability distribution equal to the norm squared of the wave\nfunction for an initial time. One learns what the new effective wave\nfunction is from one\u2019s measurement results, but one never knows\nmore than what is allowed by the standard quantum statistics. Indeed,\nBohm\u2019s theory always predicts the standard quantum probabilities\nfor particle configurations, but it predicts these as epistemic\nprobabilities. Bohm\u2019s theory is supposed to give determinate\nmeasurement results in terms of determinate particle configurations\n(say the position of the pointer on a measuring device). See the entry\non\n Bohmian mechanics\n and Barrett (2020) for further details.\n\nIf one chooses configuration as the preferred physical observable and\nadopts the particle dynamics of Bohm\u2019s theory, then one can\nconstruct a many-threads theory by fixing the initial wave function\nand the Hamiltonian and then considering every possible initial\nconfiguration of particles to correspond to a different full history\nfor a possible world. Here the prior probabilities are given by the\ndistribution postulate in Bohm\u2019s theory, and the updated\nepistemic probabilities yield the effective Bohmian wave function. On\nthis view, the only difference between Bohm\u2019s theory and the\nassociated many-threads theory is that the many-threads theory treats\nall possible Bohmian worlds as actual and quantum probabilities as\nepistemic self-location probabilities over these worlds. A\nmany-threads theory might be constructed for virtually any determinate\nphysical quantity just as one would construct a hidden-variable or a\nmodal theory. See the entry on entries on\n Bohmian mechanics\n and\n modal interpretations of quantum mechanics\n and Vink (1993).\n\nThe upshot is that if one takes the account of determinate records and\nquantum probabilities in pure wave mechanics alone to be inadequate,\nadding hidden variables provides a sure-fire way to get ordinary\nrecords and forward-looking probabilities. That said, there is good\nhistorical reason to suppose that Everett did not have a\nhidden-variable theory in mind.\n\nEverett explicitly discussed Bohmian mechanics in two places in his\nlong thesis (1956, 75, 153\u20135). His complaint was that\nBohm\u2019s theory was \u201cmore cumbersome than the conceptually\nsimpler theory based on pure wave mechanics.\u201d Even so, he took\nBohmian mechanics to be of \u201cgreat theoretical importance\u201d\nbecause it \u201cshowed that \u2018hidden variable\u2019 theories\nare indeed possible\u201d contrary to received wisdom. Concerning\nhidden-variable theories like Bohm\u2019s, Everett further\nacknowledged that \u201c[i]t cannot be disputed that these theories\nare often appealing and might conceivably become important should\nfuture discoveries indicate serious inadequacies in the present scheme\n[pure wave mechanics] (i.e. they might be more easily modified to\nencompass new experience)\u201d (1956, 155). While Everett thought\nthat he could adequately explain (or better, explain away) quantum\nprobabilities, given the subsequent difficulty in understanding\nforward-looking quantum probabilities in pure wave mechanics, that\nBohmian mechanics and other many-threads theories treat quantum\nprobability in an entirely straightforward way is a manifest virtue,\none that may ultimately be useful in finding a satisfactory extension\nof pure wave mechanics.\n",
