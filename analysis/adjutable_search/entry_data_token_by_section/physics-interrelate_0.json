Philosopher\u2019s Sense of Reduction\n\n\nMost contemporary discussions of reductive relations between a pair of\ntheories owe considerable debt to the work by Ernest Nagel. In The\nStructure of Science, Nagel asserts that \u201c[r]eduction \u2026 is the\nexplanation of a theory or a set of experimental laws established in\none area of inquiry, by a theory usually though not invariably\nformulated for some other domain.\u201d (Nagel 1961, 338) The general\nschema here is as follows: \n\n\\(T\\) reduces \\(T'\\) just in case the laws of\n\\(T'\\) are derivable from those of \\(T\\).\n\n\n\nShowing how these derivations are possible for \u201cparadigm\u201d examples\nof intertheoretic reduction turns out to be rather difficult.\n\n\nNagel distinguishes two types of reductions on the basis of whether\nor not the vocabulary of the reduced theory is a subset of the reducing\ntheory. If it is\u2014that is, if the reduced theory \\(T'\\)\ncontains no descriptive terms not contained in the reducing theory\n\\(T\\), and the terms of \\(T'\\) are understood to have\napproximately the same meanings that they have in \\(T\\), then\nNagel calls the reduction of \\(T'\\) by \\(T\\)\n\u201chomogeneous.\u201d In this case, while the reduction may very well be\nenlightening in various respects, and is part of the \u201cnormal\ndevelopment of a science,\u201d most people believe that there is nothing\nterribly special or interesting from a philosophical point of view\ngoing on here. (Nagel 1961, 339.)\n\n\nLawrence Sklar (1967, 110\u2013111) points out that, from a\nhistorical perspective, this attitude is somewhat naive. The number of\nactual cases in the history of science where a genuine homogeneous\nreduction takes place are few and far between. Nagel, himself, took as\na paradigm example of homogeneous reduction, the reduction of the\nGalilean laws of falling bodies to Newtonian mechanics. But, as Sklar\npoints out, what actually can be derived from the Newtonian theory are\napproximations to the laws of the reduced Galilean theory. The\napproximations, of course, are strictly speaking incompatible\nwith the actual laws and so, despite the fact that no concepts appear\nin the Galilean theory that do not also appear in the Newtonian theory,\nthere is no deductive derivation of the laws of the one from\nthe laws of the other. Hence, strictly speaking, there is no\nreduction on the deductive Nagelian model.\n\n\nOne way out of this problem for the proponent of Nagel-type\nreductions is to make a distinction between explaining a theory (or\nexplaining the laws of a given theory) and explaining it away. (Sklar\n1967, 112\u2013113) Thus, we may still speak of reduction if the\nderivation of the approximations to the reduced theory\u2019s laws serves to\naccount for why the reduced theory works as well as it does in its\n(perhaps more limited) domain of applicability. This is consonant with\nmore sophisticated versions of Nagel-type reductions in which part of\nthe very process of reduction involves revisions to the reduced theory.\nThis process arises as a natural consequence of trying to deal with\nwhat Nagel calls \u201cheterogeneous\u201d reductions.\n\n\nThe task of characterizing reduction is more involved when the\nreduction is heterogeneous\u2014that is, when the reduced theory\ncontains terms or concepts that do not appear in the reducing theory.\nNagel takes, as a paradigm example of heterogeneous reduction, the\n(apparent) reduction of thermodynamics, or at least some parts of\nthermodynamics, to statistical\n mechanics.[1]\n For instance, thermodynamics contains the concept of temperature\n(among others) that is lacking in the reducing theory of statistical\nmechanics.\n\n\nNagel notes that \u201cif the laws of the secondary science [the reduced\ntheory] contain terms that do not occur in the theoretical assumptions\nof the primary discipline [the reducing theory] \u2026 , the logical\nderivation of the former from the latter is prima facie\nimpossible.\u201d (Nagel 1961, 352) As a consequence, Nagel introduces\ntwo \u201cnecessary formal conditions\u201d required for the reduction to take\nplace:\n\nConnectability. \u201cAssumptions of some kind must be\nintroduced which postulate suitable relations between whatever is\nsignified by \u2018A\u2019 [the term to be reduced, that is, an\nelement of the vocabulary of theory \\(T'\\)] and traits\nrepresented by theoretical terms already present in the primary\n[reducing] science.\u201d\nDerivability. \u201cWith the help of these additional\nassumptions, all the laws of the secondary science, including those\ncontaining the term \u2018A,\u2019 must be logically derivable from\nthe theoretical premises and their associated coordinating definitions\nin the primary discipline.\u201d (Nagel 1961, 353\u2013354)\n\n\n\nThe connectability condition brings with it a number of interpretive\nproblems. Exactly what is, or should be, the status of the \u201csuitable\nrelations,\u201d often called bridge \u201claws\u201d or bridge hypotheses? Are they\nestablished by linguistic investigation alone? Are they factual\ndiscoveries? If the latter, what sort of necessity do they involve? Are\nthey identity relations that are contingently necessary or will some\nsort of weaker relation, such as nomic coextensivity, suffice? Much of\nthe philosophical literature on reduction addresses these questions\nabout the status of the bridge\n laws.[2]\n\n\nThe consideration of certain examples lends plausibility to the\nidea, prevalent in the literature, that the bridge laws should be\nconsidered to express some kind of identity relation. For instance,\nSklar notes that the reduction of the \u201ctheory\u201d of physical optics to\nthe theory of electromagnetic radiation proceeds by\nidentifying one class of entities \u2014 light waves \u2014\nwith (part of) another class \u2014 electromagnetic radiation. He says\n\u201c\u2026 the place of correlatory laws [bridge laws] is taken by\nempirically established identifications of two classes of\nentities. Light waves are not correlated with electromagnetic waves,\nfor they are electromagnetic waves.\u201d (Sklar 1967, 120) In\nfact, if something like Nagelian reduction is going to work, it is\ngenerally accepted that the bridge laws should reflect the existence of\nsome kind of synthetic identity.\n\n\nKenneth Schaffner calls the bridge laws \u201creduction functions.\u201d He\ntoo notes that they must be taken to reflect synthetic identities\nsince, at least initially, they require empirical support for their\njustification. \u201cGenes were not discovered to be DNA via the analysis of\nmeaning; important and difficult empirical research was\nrequired to make such an identification.\u201d (Schaffner 1976, 614\u2013615)\n\n\nNow one problem facing this sort of account was forcefully presented\nby Feyerabend in \u201cExplanation, Reduction, and Empiricism.\u201d (Feyerabend\n1962) Consider the term \u201ctemperature\u201d as it functions in classical\nthermodynamics. This term is defined in terms of Carnot cycles and is\nrelated to the strict, nonstatistical second law as it appears in that\ntheory. The so-called reduction of classical thermodynamics to\nstatistical mechanics, however, fails to identify or associate\nnonstatistical features in the reducing theory, statistical\nmechanics, with the nonstatistical concept of temperature as it appears\nin the reduced theory. How can one have a genuine reduction, if terms\nwith their meanings fixed by the role they play in the reduced theory\nget identified with terms having entirely different meanings? Classical\nthermodynamics is not a statistical theory. The very possibility of\nfinding a reduction function or bridge law that captures the concept of\ntemperature and the strict, nonstatistical, role it plays in the\nthermodynamics seems impossible.\n\n\nThe plausibility of this argument, of course, depends on certain\nviews about how meaning accrues to theoretical terms in a theory.\nHowever, just by looking at the historical development of\nthermodynamics one thing seems fairly clear. Most physicists, now,\nwould accept the idea that our concept of temperature and our\nconception of other \u201cexact\u201d terms that appear in classical\nthermodynamics such as \u201centropy,\u201d need to be modified in light of the\nalleged reduction to statistical mechanics. Textbooks, in fact,\ntypically speak of the theory of \u201cstatistical thermodynamics.\u201d The very\nprocess of \u201creduction\u201d often leads to a corrected version of the\nreduced theory.\n\n\nIn fact, Schaffner and others have developed sophisticated Nagelian\ntype schemas for reduction that explicitly try to capture these\nfeatures of actual theory change. The idea is explicitly to include in\nthe model, the \u201ccorrected reduced theory\u201d such as statistical\nthermodynamics. Thus, Schaffner (1976, 618) holds that \\(T\\)\nreduces \\(T'\\) if and only if there is a corrected version\nof \\(T'\\), call it \\(T'^*\\) such that\n\nThe primitive terms of \\(T'^*\\) are associated via\nreduction functions (or bridge laws) with various terms of\n\\(T\\).\n\\(T'^*\\) is derivable from \\(T\\) when it is\nsupplemented with the reduction functions specified in 1.\n\\(T'^*\\) corrects \\(T'\\) in that it makes more\naccurate predictions than does \\(T'\\).\n\\(T'\\) is explained by \\(T\\) in that\n\\(T'\\) and \\(T'^*\\) are strongly\nanalogous to one another, and \\(T\\) indicates why\n\\(T'\\) works as well as it does in its domain of\nvalidity.\n\n\n\nMuch work clearly is being done here by the intuitive conception of\n\u201cstrong analogy\u201d between the reduced theory \\(T'\\) and the\ncorrected reduced theory \\(T'^*\\). In some cases, as\nsuggested by Nickles (1973) and Wimsatt (1976), the conception of\nstrong analogy may find further refinement by appeal to what was\nreferred to as the \u201cphysicist\u2019s\u201d sense of reduction.\n",
