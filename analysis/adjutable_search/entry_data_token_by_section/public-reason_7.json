The most obvious answer is that everyone to whom the\nrules are meant to apply must be included in the constituency of\npublic reason. But this simple answer requires clarification. For\nexample, it seems that rules prohibiting murder and rape do not need\nto be justifiable to, or acceptable to everyone, including those\npersons who sincerely wish to engage in these actions and would prefer\nthat such actions be permissible. Similarly, those who hold racist and\nsexist views may not find certain rules prohibiting discrimination\njustified or acceptable, but that does not seem to bear on the\nnormative status of those rules. For this reason, among others,\nvirtually all proponents of public reason favor an idealized\naccount of the constituency of public reason. Members of the\nconstituency can be epistemically idealized, normatively idealized, or\nboth.\n\nOn Rawls\u2019s influential account, reasonable persons\nrepresent the constituency of public reason. Reasonable persons are\ndefined by their acceptance of two main ideas. First, reasonable\npersons are, when among equals, \u201cready to propose principles and\nstandards as fair terms of cooperation and to abide by them willingly,\ngiven the assurance that others will likewise do so. Those norms they\nview as reasonable for everyone to accept and therefore as justifiable\nto them; and they are ready to discuss the fair terms that others\npropose\u201d (Rawls 1996, 49). Second, reasonable persons accept\nwhat Rawls calls the burdens of judgment and \u201caccept their\nconsequences for the use of public reason in directing the legitimate\nexercise of political power in a constitutional regime\u201d (Rawls\n1996, 54). The burdens of judgment are the many \u201chazards\ninvolved in the correct (and conscientious) exercise of our powers of\nreason and judgment in the ordinary course of political life,\u201d\n(Rawls 1996, 55\u201356) which explain how reasonable and rational\npeople will permanently disagree about many matters of value and\nethics. Rawls\u2019s list of the burdens includes the following\nfacts: (a) empirical and scientific evidence is often complex and\nconflicting; (b) we may reasonably disagree about the relative weight\nof different considerations; (c) concepts are vague and subject to\nhard cases; (d) the way we assess evidence and weigh values can be\nshaped by our total life experience; (e) different normative\nconsiderations on different sides can make overall assessment\ndifficult; and (f) the number of values any social institution can\nincorporate is limited (Rawls 1996, 56\u201357). The burdens of\njudgment explain why reasonable and rational people will be\npermanently divided over matters of philosophy, religion, and other\naspects of the good life. Because reasonable persons accept these two\nideas, Rawls suggests they will also accept the idea of public\nreason\u2014the only terms of social cooperation that will seem fair\ngiven the burdens of judgment will be terms that can be justified by\nappeal to ideals or arguments that all reasonable persons can accept.\nReasonable persons will thus eschew appeals to religious ideas or\nother controversial claims over which reasonable persons are assumed\nto disagree, and instead appeal only to those public or political\nideas that are part of a liberal democratic political culture and can\nbe assumed acceptable to all persons as reasonable and rational (Rawls\n1996, 217).\n\nThis Rawlsian account of the constituency of public reason is both\nepistemically and normatively idealized. We can assume the\nconstituency of public reason includes only those persons who are\nrational and so objections to proposed rules or principles cannot fail\nthe test of public reason simply because some people have irrational\nviews or have made clearly faulty inferences. But this epistemic\nidealization is tempered by the fact that reasonable persons accept\nthe burdens of judgment; controversial claims about religion,\nmorality, or philosophy cannot be part of public reason. And there is\nalso normative idealization: the constituency includes only those who\naccept certain political values or ideals (e.g. the idea of citizens\nas free and equal, or society as a fair system of social cooperation).\nBoth idealizations have been the subject of much scrutiny and\ncriticism. Some suggest, for example, that there is no need for\nreasonable persons to accept the burdens of judgment (Lecce 2008,\n162\u2013182; McKinnon 2002, 45\u201356; Wenar 1995, 41\u201348).\nOthers have argued that Rawls\u2019s conception of the reasonable\nperson includes too much normative content (Bohman 2003; Habermas\n1995, 126\u2013129). Some further issues will be discussed in\nsections 7 and 8 below.\n\nA somewhat less idealized view of the constituency of public reason is\noffered by Gaus (2011), who suggests that we should conceptualize the\nmembers of this constituency\u2014he calls them Members of the\nPublic\u2014as moderately idealized counterparts of the real people\nto whom our moral and political rules apply. These Members of the\nPublic \u201care not so idealized that their reasoning is\ninaccessible to their real-world counterparts\u201d (Gaus 2011, 276),\nbut instead are idealized in the following sense: they hold the\nbeliefs that their real-world counterparts would be justified in\nholding after engaging in a \u201crespectable amount\u201d of good\nreasoning (Gaus 2011, 250)\u2014reasoning that starts from the\nevaluative commitments of the real-world agents they represent and\nfrom the level of Kohlbergian moral reasoning those agents are capable\nof (Gaus 2011, 277). This modest level of idealization ensures that\nthe constituency of public reason will be far more diverse than the\none envisaged by Rawls. This constituency will include members who\nadhere to different standards of rationality and have widely divergent\nsets of normative beliefs, including very divergent beliefs about\nbasic matters of justice. This conception of the constituency of\npublic reason thus purchases inclusivity, and greater approximation to\nreal people\u2019s moral judgments. But this may come with a\nsubstantial cost, since it is less clear how such a diverse\nconstituency may agree on any rules at all, let alone rules that we\ncan be confident would reflect our considered judgments about morality\nand justice (Quong 2014).\n\nOn yet a different view, the constituency of public reason should be\neven more inclusive with very few, if any, standards that need to be\nmet before one qualifies as someone to whom rules or principles must\nbe justified. For example, some suggest that everyone affected by some\nproposed norm should be a participant in the public use of reason\nregarding the validity of that norm, provided they are willing to\nengage in a respectful justificatory dialogue with others (e.g. Bohman\n2003). Support for this more inclusive conception can be provided by\nHabermas\u2019s account of discourse ethics (see sect. 1.1 above),\nsince on this account norms can only be valid when they can be the\nappropriate object of a suitable intersubjective agreement amongst all\naffected parties. The same worries about indeterminacy and normative\ncontent that apply to Gaus\u2019s moderately idealized Members of the\nPublic would appear apply with even greater force to this view.\n",
