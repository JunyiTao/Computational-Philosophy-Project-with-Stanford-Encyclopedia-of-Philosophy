    "main_text": "Arguments For Constructive Empiricism || Poor arguments for constructive empiricism\n2.1 Poor arguments for constructive empiricism\n\nBefore turning to stronger arguments for constructive empiricism, it\nwill be helpful to draw attention to a couple scientific anti-realist\narguments that the constructive empiricist would be well-advised not\nto use in support of her view.\n\nFirst, consider the Argument from Underdetermination. This argument\nstarts by pointing out that for any theory, there are rival theories\nthat are empirically equivalent to it\u2014the theories make all the\nsame predictions about what\u2019s observable, but differ only with\nregard to what\u2019s unobservable. The argument goes on to say that\nit follows that all the empirically equivalent theories are equally\nbelievable, and hence belief in the truth of any one of those\nempirically equivalent theories must be irrational.\n\nWhile the constructive empiricist view is a view about the aims of\nscience and not a normative theory in epistemology, the constructive\nempiricist is an individual who values the sort of epistemic modesty\nwhich might motivate one to harbor anti-realist sympathies in general.\nTo the extent that the constructive empiricist embraces epistemic\nmodesty, she might also be an epistemic voluntarist, a person who\nbelieves that \u201crationality is only bridled irrationality\u201d\n(van Fraassen 1989, 172). Any behavior that does not make one\ninconsistent or incoherent is rational, by the voluntarist\u2019s\nlights. Such an attitude might seem the natural epistemic one for the\nconstructive empiricist to hold, insofar as the constructive\nempiricist is impressed by the cognitive limits that prevent us from\nhaving conclusive evidence in favor of any one particular theory.\n\nOne reason the constructive empiricist would be well-advised not to\nembrace the Argument from Underdetermination, then, is that it goes\nagainst a voluntarist position in epistemology. (This point is clearly\nmade by Van Dyck 2007, 19\u201322, and agreed to by van Fraassen\n2007, 347.) By the voluntarist\u2019s reckoning, going beyond the\nevidence to the extent that one chooses to believe in the truth of a\ntheory, both in its observable and unobservable aspects, could very\nwell be rational.\n\nThe relatively permissive epistemological view of a constructive\nempiricist who is also an epistemic voluntarist helps explain why such\na constructive empiricist would be prudent not to take constructive\nempiricism to be a normative theory concerning the deliverances of\nscience. Mistakenly understood in that normative way, constructive\nempiricism would imply that belief in a theory\u2019s empirical\nadequacy is the only rational candidate for the belief involved in a\ntheory\u2019s acceptance. Such a constraint on the rationality of\nopinion is clearly at odds with any epistemic voluntarism the\nconstructive empiricist might embrace.\n\nGideon Rosen (1994, 160\u2013161) gives another reason that the\nconstructive empiricist ought not accept underdetermination arguments\nas grounds for constructive empiricism. Consider the following two\nhypotheses:\n\nT is empirically adequate\u2014i.e., T is\nadequate to all observable phenomena, past, present, and future.\nT is adequate to all phenomena observed so far.\n\n\nAs Rosen notes, one\u2019s current evidence does not tell in favor of\neither hypothesis over the other. So by an underdetermination-style\nargument, one is not justified in believing either hypothesis. But\nbelief in (A) is the belief the constructive empiricist contends is\ninvolved in theory acceptance. (For more on how one might take\nRosen\u2019s argument as an argument against constructive empiricism,\nsee Section 3.4 below.)\n\nThe second scientific anti-realist argument a person would be\nwell-advised not to use in support of constructive empiricism is the\nPessimistic Induction Argument. This argument points out that\nscientific theories in the past have been shown to be false, so by\ninduction, we should think that current theories are false, too. If\nthis argument is taken to have the conclusion that belief in our\ncurrent theories is irrational, then, as above, the argument is\nincompatible with any voluntarism the constructive empiricist might\nembrace. The argument is also incompatible with the view of a\nconstructive empiricist who, in the skeptical spirit of anti-realist\nviews in general, rejects reasoning based on a principle of induction.\nVan Fraassen, for instance, writes: \u201cI do not think that there\nis such a thing as Induction, in any form\u201d (2007, 343).\n",
