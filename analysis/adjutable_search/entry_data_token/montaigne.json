Life\n\n Montaigne (1533\u20131592) came from a rich bourgeois family that acquired\nnobility after his father fought in Italy in the army of King Francis\nI of France; he came back with the firm intention of bringing refined\nItalian culture to France. He decorated his P\u00e9rigord castle in\nthe style of an ancient Roman villa. He also decided that his son\nwould not learn Latin in school. He arranged instead for a German\npreceptor and the household to speak to him exclusively in Latin at\nhome. So the young Montaigne grew up speaking Latin and reading\nVergil, Ovid, and Horace on his own. At the age of six, he was sent to\nboard at the Coll\u00e8ge de Guyenne in Bordeaux, which he later\npraised as the best humanist college in France, though he found fault\nwith humanist colleges in general. Where Montaigne later studied law,\nor, indeed, whether he ever studied law at all is not clear. The only\nthing we know with certainty is that his father bought him an office\nin the Court of P\u00e9rigueux. He then met Etienne de La\nBo\u00ebtie with whom he formed an intimate friendship and whose death\nsome years later, in 1563, left him deeply distraught. Tired of active\nlife, he retired at the age of only 37 to his father\u2019s castle. In the\nsame year, 1571, he was nominated Gentleman of King Charles IX\u2019s\nOrdinary Chamber, and soon thereafter, also of Henri de Navarre\u2019s\nChamber. He received the decoration of the Order of Saint-Michel, a\ndistinction all the more exceptional as Montaigne\u2019s lineage was from\nrecent nobility. On the title page of the first edition (1580) of the\nEssays, we read: \u201cEssais de Messire Michel Seigneur de\nMontaigne, Chevalier de l\u2019ordre du Roy, & Gentilhomme ordinaire de\nsa chambre.\u201d Initially keen to show off his titles and, thus,\nhis social standing, Montaigne had the honorifics removed in the\nsecond edition (1582). \n\n Replicating Petrarca\u2019s choice in De vita solitaria,\nMontaigne chose to dedicate himself to the Muses. In his library,\nwhich was quite large for the period, he had wisdom formulas carved on\nthe wooden beams. They were drawn from, amongst others,\nEcclesiastes, Sextus Empiricus, Lucretius, and other\nclassical authors, whom he read intensively.  To escape fits of\nmelancholy, he began to commit his thoughts to paper. In 1580, he\nundertook a journey to Italy, whose main goal was to cure the\npain of his kidney stones at thermal resorts. The journey is related\nin part by a secretary, in part by Montaigne himself, in a manuscript\nthat was only discovered during the XVIIIth century, given the title\nThe Journal of the Journey to Italy, and forgotten soon\nafter. While Montaigne was taking the baths near Pisa, he learnt of\nhis election as Mayor of Bordeaux. He was first tempted to refuse out\nof modesty, but eventually accepted (he even received a letter from\nthe King urging him to take the post) and was later re-elected. In his\nsecond term he came under criticism for having abandoned the town\nduring the great plague in an attempt to protect himself and his\nfamily. His time in office was dimmed by the wars of religion between\nCatholics and Protestants. Several members of his family converted to\nProtestantism, but Montaigne himself remained a Catholic. \n2. Work \n\n  Montaigne wrote three books of Essays. (\u201cEssay\u201d\nwas an original name for this kind of work; it became an appreciated\ngenre soon after.) Three main editions are recognized: 1580 (at this\nstage, only the first two books were written), 1588, and 1595. The\nlast edition, which could not be supervised by Montaigne himself, was\nedited from the manuscript by his adoptive daughter Marie de\nGournay. Till the end of the XIXth century, the copy text for all new\neditions was that of 1595; Fortunat Strowski and shortly after him\nPierre Villey dismissed it in favor of the \u201cBordeaux\ncopy\u201d, a text of the 1588 edition supplemented by manuscript\nadditions.[1]\nMontaigne enriched his text continuously; he preferred to add for the\nsake of diversity, rather than to \ncorrect.[2]\n The unity of the work and the order of\nevery single chapter remain problematic. We are unable to detect\nobvious links from one chapter to the next: in the first book,\nMontaigne jumps from \u201cIdleness\u201d (I,8) to\n\u201cLiars\u201d (I,9), then from \u201cPrompt or slow\nspeech\u201d (I,10) to \u201cPrognostications\u201d (I,11). The\nrandom aspect of the work, acknowledged by the author himself, has\nbeen a challenge for commentators ever since. Part of the brilliance\nof the Essays lies in this very ability to elicit various\nforms of explanatory coherence whilst at the same time defying\nthem. The work is so rich and flexible that it accommodates virtually\nany academic trend. Yet, it is also so resistant to interpretation\nthat it reveals the limits of each interpretation.\n\n  Critical studies of the Essays have, until recently, been\nmainly of a literary nature. However, to consider Montaigne as a\nwriter rather than as a philosopher can be a way of ignoring a\ndisturbing thinker. Indeed, he shook some fundamental\naspects of Western thought, such as the superiority we assign to man\nover\n animals,[3]\n to European civilization over\n \u201cBarbarians\u201d,[4]\n or to reason as an alleged universal standard.  A\ntradition rooted in the 19th century tends to relegate his work to\nthe status of literary impressionism or to the expression of a\nfrivolous subjectivity. To do him justice, one needs to bear in\nmind the inseparable unity of thought and style in his work.\nMontaigne\u2019s repeated revisions of his text, as modern editions show with\nthe three letters A, B, C, standing for the three main editions,\nmirror the relationship between the activity of his thought and\nthe Essays as a work in progress. The Essays display\nboth the laboriousness and the delight of thinking. \nIn Montaigne we have a writer whose work is deeply infused by \nphilosophical thought. One verse out of sixteen in Lucretius\u2019\n De natura rerum is quoted in the\n Essays.[5]\n If it is true, as Edmund Husserl said, that philosophy is a shared\nendeavor, Montaigne is perhaps the most exemplary of philosophers\nsince his work extensively borrows and quotes from others.  Montaigne\nmanaged to internalize a huge breadth of reading, so that his\nerudition does not appear as such.  He created a most singular work,\nyet one that remains deeply rooted in the community of poets,\nhistorians, and philosophers. His decision to use only his own\njudgment in dealing with all sorts of matters, his resolutely distant\nattitude towards memory and knowledge, his warning that we should not\nmix God or transcendent principles with the human world, are some of\nthe key elements that characterize Montaigne\u2019s position. As a\nhumanist, he considered that one has to assimilate the classics, but\nabove all to display virtue, \u201caccording to the opinion of\nPlato, who says that steadfastness, faith, and sincerity are real\nphilosophy, and the other sciences which aim at other things are only\npowder and\n rouge.\u201d[6]\n\n3. A Philosophy of Free Judgment\n\n   Montaigne rejects the theoretical or speculative way of\nphilosophizing that prevailed under the Scholastics ever since the\nMiddle Ages. According to him, science does not exist, but only a\ngeneral belief in science. Petrarch had already criticized the\nScholastics for worshiping Aristotle as their God. Siding with the\nhumanists, Montaigne develops a sharp criticism of science\n\u201c\u00e0 la mode des\n Geom\u00e9triens\u201d,[7]\n the mos geometricus deemed to be the most rigorous.  It is\nmerely \u201ca practice and business of\n science\u201d,[8]\n he says, which is restricted to the University and essentially\ncarried out between masters and their disciples. The main problem of\nthis kind of science is that it makes us spend our time justifying as\nrational the beliefs we inherit, instead of calling into question\ntheir foundations; it makes us label fashionable opinions as truth,\ninstead of gauging their strength. Whereas science should be a free\ninquiry, it consists only in gibberish discussions on how we should\nread Aristotle or\n Galen.[9]\n Critical judgment is systematically silenced.  Montaigne demands a\nthought process that would not be tied down by any doctrinaire\nprinciple, a thought process that would lead to free enquiry. \n\n    If we trace back the birth of modern science, we find that\nMontaigne as a philosopher was ahead of his time. In 1543, Copernicus\nput the earth in motion, depriving man of his cosmological\ncentrality. Yet he nevertheless changed little in the medieval\nconception of the world as a sphere. The Copernican world became an\n\u201copen\u201d world only with Thomas Digges (1576) although his\nsky was still situated in space, inhabited by gods and\n angels.[10]\n One has to wait for Giordano Bruno to find the first representative\nof the modern conception of an infinite universe (1584). But whether\nBruno is a modern mind remains controversial (the planets are still\nanimals, etc). Montaigne, on the contrary, is entirely free from the\nmedieval conception of the spheres. He owes his cosmological freedom\nto his deep interest in ancient philosophers, to Lucretius in\nparticular. In the longest chapter of the Essays, the\n\u201cApologie de Raymond Sebond\u201d, Montaigne conjures up many\nopinions, regarding the nature of the cosmos, or the nature of the\nsoul. He weighs the Epicureans\u2019 opinion that several worlds exist,\nagainst that of the unicity of the world put forth by both Aristotle\nand Aquinas. He comes out in favor of the former, without ranking his\nown evaluation as a truth. \nAs a humanist, Montaigne conceived of philosophy as morals. In the\nchapter \u201cOn the education of\n children\u201d,[11]\n education is identified with philosophy, this being understood as the\nformation of judgment and manners in everyday life: \u201cfor\nphilosophy, which, as the molder of judgment and conduct, will be his\nprincipal lesson, has the privilege of being everywhere at\n home\u201d.[12]\n Philosophy, which consists essentially in the use of judgment,\nis significant to the very ordinary, varied and\n \u201cundulating\u201d[13]\n process of life. In fact, under the guise of innocuous anecdotes,\nMontaigne achieved the humanist revolution in philosophy.  He moved\nfrom a conception of philosophy conceived of as theoretical science,\nto a philosophy conceived of as the practice of free\njudgment. Lamenting that \u201cphilosophy, even with people of\nunderstanding, should be an empty and fantastic name, a thing of no\nuse and no\n value\u201d,[14]\n he asserted that philosophy should be the most cheerful activity. He\npractised philosophy by setting his judgment to trial, in order to\nbecome aware of its weaknesses, but also to get to know its\nstrength. \u201cEvery movement reveals\n us\u201d,[15]\n but our judgments do so the best. At the beginning of the past\ncentury, one of Montaigne\u2019s greatest commentators, Pierre Villey,\ndeveloped the idea that Montaigne truly became himself through\nwriting. This idea remains more or less true, in spite of its obvious\nlink with late romanticist psychology. The Essays remain an\nexceptional historical testimony of the progress of privacy and\nindividualism, a blossoming of subjectivity, an attainment of personal\nmaturity that will be copied, but maybe never matched since. It\nseems that Montaigne, who dedicated himself to freedom of the mind and\npeacefulness of the soul, did not have any other aim through writing than\ncultivating and educating himself. Since philosophy had failed to\ndetermine a secure path towards happiness, he committed each individual\nto do\n so in his own way.[16]\n\n\n  Montaigne wants to escape the stifling of thought by knowledge, a\nwide-spread phenomenon which he called\n \u201cpedantism\u201d,[17]\n an idea that he may have gleaned from the tarnishing of professors by\nthe Commedia dell\u2019arte. He praises one of the most\nfamous professors of the day, Adrianus Turnebus, for having combined \nrobust judgment with massive erudition. We have to moderate\nour thirst for knowledge, just as we do our appetite for\npleasure. Siding here with Callicles against Plato, Montaigne asserts\nthat a gentleman should not dedicate himself entirely to\n philosophy.[18]\n Practised with restraint, it proves useful, whereas in excess it leads\nto eccentricity and\n insociability.[19]\n Reflecting on the education of the children of the aristocracy\n(chapter I, 26, is dedicated to the countess Diane de Foix, who was\nthen pregnant), Montaigne departs significantly from a traditional\nhumanist education, the very one he himself received. Instead of\nfocusing on the ways and means of making the teaching of Latin more\neffective, as pedagogues in the wake of Erasmus usually did, Montaigne\nstresses the need for action and playful activities. The child will\nconform early to social and political customs, but without\nservility. The use of judgment in every circumstance, as a warrant for\npractical intelligence and personal freedom, has to remain at the core\nof education. He transfers the major responsibility of education from\nthe school to everyday life: \u201cWonderful brilliance may be gained\nfor human judgment by getting to know\n men\u201d.[20]\n The priority given to the formation of judgment and character\nstrongly opposes the craving for a powerful memory during his time. He\nreserves for himself the freedom to pick up bits of knowledge here and\nthere, displaying the \u201cnonchalance\u201d or unconcern intellectually, much in\nthe same way that Castiglione\u2019s courtier would use\nsprezzatura in social relationships. Although Montaigne\npresents this nonchalance as essential to his nature, his position is\nnot innocent: it allows him to take on the voice now of a Stoic, and\nthen of a Sceptic, now of an Epicurean and then of a\nChristian. Although his views are never fully original, they always\nbear his unmistakable mark. Montaigne\u2019s thought, which is often rated\nas modern in so many aspects, remains deeply rooted in the classical\ntradition. Montaigne navigates easily through heaps of classical\nknowledge, proposing remarkable literary and philosophical innovations\nalong the way. \n\n   Montaigne begins his project to know man by noticing that the same\nhuman behavior can have opposite effects, or that even opposite conducts\ncan have the same effects: \u201cby diverse means we arrive at the\nsame\n end\u201d.[21]\n Human life cannot be turned into an object of rational theory. Human\nconduct does not obey universal rules, but a great diversity of rules,\namong which the most accurate still fall short of the intended mark.\n\u201cHuman reason is a tincture infused in about equal strength in\nall our opinions and ways, whatever their form: infinite in substance,\ninfinite in\n diversity\u201d[22]\n says the chapter on custom. By focusing on anecdotal experience,\nMontaigne comes thus to write \u201cthe masterpiece of modern moral\nscience\u201d, according to the great commentator Hugo Friedrich.  He\ngives up the moral ambition of telling how men should live, in order\nto arrive at a non-prejudiced mind for knowing man as he\nis. \u201cOthers form man, I tell of\n him\u201d.[23]\n Man is ever since \u201cwithout a definition\u201d, as philosopher Marcel Conche\n commented.[24]\n In the chapter \u201cApologie de Raimond Sebond\u201d, Montaigne\ndraws from classical and Renaissance knowledge in order to remind us\nthat, in some parts of the world, we find men that bear little\nresemblance to us. Our experience of man and things should not be\nperceived as limited by our present standards of judgment. It is \na sort of madness when we settle limits for the possible and the\n impossible.[25]\n\nPhilosophy has failed to secure man a determined idea of his place\nin the world, or of his nature. Metaphysical or psychological\nopinions, indeed far too numerous, come as a burden more than as a\nhelp. Montaigne pursues his quest for knowledge through experience;\nthe meaning of concepts is not set down by means of a definition, it\nis related to common language or to historical examples. One of the\nessential elements of experience is the ability to reflect on one\u2019s\nactions and thoughts. Montaigne is engaging in a case-by-case\ngn\u00f4ti seauton, \u201cknow thyself\u201d: although truth\nin general is not truly an appropriate object for human faculties, we\ncan reflect on our experience. What counts is not the fact that we\neventually know the truth or not, but rather the way in which we seek\n it. \u201cThe question is not who will hit the\nring, but who will make the best runs at\n it.\u201d[26] \nThe aim is to properly\nexercise our judgment. \n\n  Montaigne\u2019s thinking baffles our most common categories. The vision\nof an ever-changing world that he developed threatens the being of\nall things.  \u201cWe have no communication with\n being\u201d.[27]\n We wrongly take that which appears for that which is, and we indulge\nin a dogmatic, deceptive language that is cut off from an\never-changing reality. We ought to be more careful with our use of\nlanguage.  Montaigne would prefer that children be taught other ways\nof speaking, more appropriate to the nature of human inquiry, such as\n\u201cWhat does that mean ?\u201d, \u201cI do not understand\nit\u201d, \u201cThis might be\u201d, \u201cIs it\n true?\u201d[28]\n Montaigne himself is fond of \u201cthese formulas that soften the\nboldness of our propositions\u201d: \u201cperhaps\u201d, \u201cto\nsome extent\u201d, \u201cthey say\u201d, \u201cI\n think\u201d,[29]\n and the like. Criticism on theory and dogmatism permeates for example\nhis reflexion on politics. Because social order is too complicated to\nbe mastered by individual reason, he deems conservatism as the wisest\n stance.[30]\n This policy is grounded on the general evaluation that change is\nusually more damaging than the conservation of social\ninstitutions. Nevertheless, there may be certain circumstances that\nadvocate change as a better solution, as history sometimes\nshowed. Reason being then unable to decide a priori,\njudgment must come into play and alternate its views to find the best option. \n4. Montaigne\u2019s Scepticism\n\n With Cornelius Agrippa, Henri Estienne or Francisco Sanchez, among\nothers, Montaigne has largely contributed to the rebirth of scepticism\nduring the XVIth century. His literary encounter with Sextus produced\na decisive shock: around 1576, when Montaigne had his own personal\nmedal coined, he had it engraved with his age, with\n\u201cEpecho\u201d , \u201cI abstain\u201d in Greek, and\nanother Sceptic motto in French: \u201cQue sais-je?\u201d:\nwhat do I know ? At this period in his life, Montaigne is thought to\nhave undergone a \u201csceptical crisis\u201d, as Pierre Villey\nfamously commented. In fact, this interpretation dates back to Pascal,\nfor whom scepticism could only be a sort of momentary\n frenzy.[31]\n The \u201cApologie de Raimond Sebond\u201d, the longest chapter of\nthe Essays, bears the sign of intellectual despair that\nMontaigne manages to shake off elsewhere. But another interpretation of\nscepticism formulates it as a strategy used to confront\n\u201cfideism\u201d: because reason is unable to demonstrate\nreligious dogmas, we must rely on spiritual revelation and faith. The\nparadigm of fideism, a word which Montaigne does not use, has been\n delivered by Richard Popkin in History of\n Scepticism[32]. \nMontaigne appears here as a\nfounding father of the Counter Reformation, being the leader of the\n\u201cNouveaux Pyrrhoniens\u201d, for whom scepticism is used as a\nmeans to an end, that is, to neutralize the grip that philosophy once\nhad on religion. \n\n Commentators now agree upon the fact that Montaigne largely\ntransformed the type of scepticism he borrowed from Sextus. The two\nsides of the scale are never perfectly balanced, since reason always\ntips the scale in favor of the present at hand. This imbalance\nundermines the key mechanism of isosthenia, the equality of\nstrength of two opposing arguments. Since the suspension of judgment\ncannot occur \u201ccasually\u201d, as Sextus Empiricus would like it\nto, judgment must abstain from giving its assent. In fact, the sources\nof Montaigne\u2019s scepticism are much wider: his child readings of\nOvid\u2019s Metamorphosis, which gave him a deep awareness of\nchange, the in utramque partem academic debate which he\npractised at the Coll\u00e8ge de Guyenne (a pro and\ncontra discussion inherited from Aristotle and Cicero), and the\nhumanist philosophy of action, dealing with the uncertainty of human\naffairs, shaped his mind early on. Through them, he learned repeatedly\nthat rational appearances are deceptive. In most of the chapters of\nthe Essays, Montaigne now and then reverses his judgment:\nthese sudden shifts of perspective are designed to escape adherence,\nand to tackle the matter from another point of\n view.[33]\n The Essays mirror a discreet conduct of judgment, in keeping\nwith the formula iudicio alternante, which we still find\nengraved today on the beams of the P\u00e9rigord castle\u2019s\nlibrary. The aim is not to ruin arguments by opposing them, as it is\nthe case in the Pyrrhonian \u201cantilogy\u201d, but rather to\ncounterbalance a single opinion by taking into account other\nopinions. In order to work, each scale of judgment has to be laden. If\nwe take morals, for example, Montaigne refers to varied moral\nauthorities, one of them being custom and the other reason. Against\nevery form of dogmatism, Montaigne returns moral life to its original\ndiversity and inherent uneasiness. Through philosophy, he seeks full\naccordance with the diversity of life: \u201cAs for me, I love life\nand cultivate it as God has been pleased to grant it to\n us\u201d.[34]\n\n\n We find two readings of Montaigne as a Sceptic. The first one\nconcentrates on the polemical, negative arguments drawn from Sextus\nEmpiricus, at the end of the \u201cApology\u201d. This hard-line\nscepticism draws the picture of man as\n \u201chumiliated\u201d.[35]\n Its aim is essentially to fight the pretensions of reason and to\nannihilate human knowledge. \u201cTruth\u201d, \u201cbeing\u201d\nand \u201cjustice\u201d are equally dismissed as unattainable. Doubt\nforeshadows here Descartes\u2019 Meditations, on the problem of the\nreality of the outside world. Dismissing the objective value of one\u2019s\nrepresentations, Montaigne would have created the long-lasting problem\nof \u201csolipsism\u201d. We notice, nevertheless, that he does not\nquestion the reality of things \u2014 except occasionally at the very\nend of the \u201cApology\u201d \u2014 but the value of opinions and men. The\nsecond reading of his scepticism puts forth that Cicero\u2019s probabilism\nis of far greater significance in shaping the sceptical content of the\nEssays. After the 1570s, Montaigne no longer read Sextus;\nadditions show, however, that he took up a more and more extensive\nreading of Cicero\u2019s philosophical writings. We assume that, in his early \nsearch for polemical arguments against rationalism during the 1570s,\nMontaigne borrowed much from Sextus, but as he got tired of the\nsceptical machinery, and understood scepticism rather as an ethics of\njudgment, he went back to\n Cicero.[36]\n The paramount importance of the Academica for\nXVIth century thought has been underlined by Charles\nB. Schmitt.[37]  \nIn the free enquiry, which Cicero engaged throughout the\nvaried doctrines, the humanists found an ideal mirror of their own\nrelationship with the Classics. \u201cThe Academy, of which I am a\nfollower, gives me the opportunity to hold an opinion as if it were\nours, as soon as it shows itself to be highly\n probable\u201d[38], \nwrote Cicero in the De Officiis. Reading Seneca, Montaigne\nwill think as if he were a member of the Stoa; then changing for\nLucretius, he will think as if he had become an Epicurean, and so\non. Doctrines or opinions, beside historical stuff and personal\nexperiences, make up the nourishment of judgment. Montaigne\nassimilates opinions, according to what appears to him as true,\nwithout taking it to be absolutely true.  He insists on\nthe dialogical nature of thought, referring to Socrates\u2019 way of\nkeeping the discussion going: \u201cThe leader of Plato\u2019s dialogues, \nSocrates, is always asking questions and stirring up\ndiscussion, never concluding, never\n satisfying (\u2026).\u201d[39]\n  Judgment has to determine the most convincing position, or at least\nto determine the strengths and weaknesses of each position. The simple\ndismissal of truth would be too dogmatic a position; but if absolute\ntruth is lacking, we still have the possibility to balance\nopinions. We have resources enough, to evaluate the various\nauthorities that we have to deal with in ordinary life.\n\nThe original failure of commentators was perhaps in labelling\nMontaigne\u2019s thought as \u201csceptic\u201d without reflecting on the\nproper meaning of the essay.  Montaigne\u2019s exercise of judgment is an\nexercise of \u201cnatural judgment\u201d, which means that judgment\ndoes not need any principle or any rule as a presupposition. In this\nway, many aspects of Montaigne\u2019s thinking can be considered as\nsceptical, although they were not used for the sake of scepticism. For\nexample, when Montaigne sets down the exercise of doubt as a good\nstart in education, he understands doubt as part of the process of the\nformation of judgment. This process should lead to wisdom,\ncharacterized as \u201calways\njoyful\u201d.[40]\n Montaigne\u2019s scepticism is not a desperate\none. On the contrary, it offers the reader a sort of jubilation which\nrelies on the modest but effective pleasure in dismissing knowledge,\nthus making room for the exercise of one\u2019s natural faculties. \n5. Montaigne and Relativism \n \n Renaissance thinkers strongly felt the necessity to revise their\ndiscourse on man. But no one accentuated this necessity more than\nMontaigne: what he was looking for, when reading historians or\ntravellers such as Lopez de Gomara\u2019s History of Indies, was\nthe utmost variety of beliefs and customs that would enrich his image\nof man. Neither the Hellenistic Sage, nor the Christian Saint, nor the\nRenaissance Scholar, are unquestioned models in the\nEssays. Instead, Montaigne is considering real men, who are\nthe product of customs. \u201cHere they live on human flesh; there it\nis an act of piety to kill one\u2019s father at a certain\n age (\u2026).\u201d[41]\n The importance of custom plays a polemical part: alongside with\nscepticism, the strength of imagination (chapter I,21) or Fortune\n(chapters I,1, I,24, etc.), it contributes to the devaluation\nof reason and will. It is bound to destroy our spontaneous confidence that\nwe do know the truth, and that we live according to justice. During\nthe XVIth century, the jurists of the \u201cFrench school of\nlaw\u201d showed that the law is tied up with historical\n determinations.[42]\n In chapter I,23, \u201cOn custom\u201d, Montaigne\n seems to extrapolate on this idea : our opinions and conducts being everywhere\nthe product of custom, references to universal \u201creason\u201d,\n\u201ctruth\u201d, or \u201cjustice\u201d are to be dismissed as\nillusions. Pierre Villey was the first to use the terms\n\u201crelativity\u201d and \u201crelativism\u201d, which proved to\nbe useful tools when commenting on the fact that Montaigne\nacknowledges that no universal reason presides over the birth of our\n beliefs.[43]\n The notion of absolute truth, applied to human matters, vitiates the\nunderstanding and wreaks havoc in society. Upon further reflexion,\ncontingent customs impact everything: \u201cin short, to my way of\nthinking, there is nothing that custom will not or cannot\n do\u201d.[44]\n Montaigne calls it \u201cCirce\u2019s\n drink\u201d.[45]\n Custom is a sort of witch, whose spell, among other effects, casts\nmoral illusion. \u201cThe laws of conscience, which we say are born\nfrom nature, are born of custom. Each man, holding in inward veneration \nthe opinions and the behavior approved and accepted around him, cannot \nbreak loose from them without remorse, or apply himself to them without\nself-satisfaction.\u201d[46] \n The power of custom, indeed, \nnot only guides man in his behavior, but also persuades him of\nits legitimacy. What is crime for one person will appear normal to\nanother. In the XVIIth century, Blaise Pascal will use\nthis argument when\nchallenging the pretension of philosophers of knowing truth.  One\ncentury later, David Hume will lay stress on the fact that the power\nof custom is all the stronger, specifically because we are not aware\nof it. What are we supposed to do, then, if our reason is so flexible\nthat it \u201cchanges with two degrees of elevation towards the\npole\u201d, as Pascal\nputs it?[47]\n For the Jansenist thinker, only one alternative exists, faith in Jesus\nChrist. However, it is more complicated in the case of\nMontaigne. Getting to know all sorts of customs, through his readings\nor travels, he makes an exemplary effort to open his mind. \u201cWe\nare all huddled and concentrated in ourselves, and our vision is\nreduced to the length of our\n nose.\u201d[48]\n Custom\u2019s grip is so strong that it is dubious as to whether we are in\na position to become aware of it and shake off its\npower. \n\n Montaigne was hailed by Claude L\u00e9vi-Strauss as the progenitor  of\nthe human sciences, and the pioneer of cultural\n relativism.[49]\nHowever, Montaigne has not been willing to indulge entirely in\nrelativism. Judgment is at first sight unable to stop the relativistic\ndiscourse, but it is not left without remedy when facing the power of\ncustom. Exercise of thought is the first counterweight we can make use\nof, for example when criticizing an existing law. Customs are not\nalmighty, since their authority can be reflected upon, evaluated or\nchallenged by individual judgment. The comparative method can also be\napplied to the freeing of judgment: although lacking a universal\nstandard, we can nevertheless stand back from particular customs, by\nthe mere fact of comparing them. Montaigne thus compares heating or\ncirculating means between people. In a more tragical way, he denounces\nthe fanaticism and the cruelty displayed by Christians against one\nanother, during the civil wars in France, through a comparison with\ncannibalism: \u201cI think there is more barbarity in eating a man\nalive than in eating him dead, and in tearing by tortures and the rack\na body still full of\n feeling (\u2026).\u201d[50]\n  The meaning of the word \u201cbarbarity\u201d is not merely\nrelative to a culture or a point of view, since there are\ndegrees of barbarity.  Passing a judgment on cannibals, Montaigne also\nsays: \u201cSo we may well call these people barbarians, in respect\nto the rules of reason, but not in respect to ourselves, who surpass\nthem in every kind of\n barbarity (\u2026).\u201d[51]\n Judgment is still endowed with the possibility of postulating\nuniversal standards, such as \u201creason\u201d or\n\u201cnature\u201d, which help when evaluating actions and\nbehaviors.  Although Montaigne maintains in the \u201cApologie\u201d\nthat true reason and true justice are only known by God, he asserts in\nother chapters that these standards are somehow accessible to man,\nsince they allow judgment to consider customs as particular and\ncontingent\n rules.[52]\n In order to criticize the changeable and the relative, we must\nsuppose that our judgment is still able to \u201cbring things back to\ntruth and\n reason\u201d.[53]\n Man is everywhere enslaved by custom, but this does not mean that we\nshould accept the numbing of our mind. Montaigne elaborates a\npedagogy, which rests on the practice of judgment itself. The task of\nthe pupil is not to repeat what the master said, but, on a given\nsubject of problem, to confront his judgment with the master\u2019s\none. Moreover, relativistic readings of the Essays are forced\nto ignore certain passages that carry a more rationalistic\ntone. \u201cThe violent detriment inflicted by custom\u201d (I,23)\nis certainly not a praise of custom, but an invitation to escape\nit. In the same way that Circe\u2019s potion has changed men into pigs,\ncustom turns their intelligence into stupidity. In the toughest cases,\nMontaigne\u2019s critical use of judgment aims at giving \u201ca good\nwhiplash to the ordinary stupidity of\n judgment.\u201d[54]\n In many other places, Montaigne boasts of himself being able to\nresist vulgar opinion. Independence of thinking, alongside with\nclear-mindedness and good faith, are the first virtues a young\ngentleman should acquire.  \n6. Montaigne\u2019s Legacy from Charron to Hobbes\n\n  Pierre Charron was Montaigne\u2019s friend and official heir. In De\nla sagesse (1601 and 1604), he re-organized many of his master\u2019s\nideas, setting aside the most disturbing ones. His work is now usually\ndismissed as a dogmatic misrepresentation of Montaigne\u2019s\nthought. Nevertheless, his book was given priority over the\nEssays themselves during the whole XVIIth century, especially\nafter Malebranche\u2019s critics conspired to have the Essays\nincluded in the Roman Index of 1677.  Montaigne\u2019s historical influence\nmust be reckoned through the lens of this mediation.  Moreover,\nCharron\u2019s reading is not simply faulty. According to him, wisdom\nrelies on the readiness of judgment to revise itself towards a more\nfavorable\n outcome:[55]\n this idea is one of the most remarkable readings of the\nEssays in the early history of their reception. \n\nThe critical conception of the essay was taken up by the English\nscientist and philosopher Francis Bacon, who considered his own Essays\nas \u201cfragments of [his] conceits\u201d and \u201cdispersed meditations\u201d, aiming\nto stimulate the reader\u2019s appetite for thinking and knowledge rather\nthan satisfying it with expositions of dogmas and \nmethods.[56]\n Even in his more scientific works, such as The Advancement of\nLearning, Bacon\u2019s writing was inconclusive. He posited that this open\nand fragmentary style was the best way to inspire further thought and\nexamination: \u201cAphorisms, representing a knowledge broken, do invite\nmen to inquire \n further\u201d.[57]\n Bacon\u2019s reflections allow us to appreciate\nthe scientific value of Montaigne\u2019s Essays, insofar as they are\nincomplete works, always calling for subsequent reflections by the\nauthor and the reader, thus inspiring and promoting the development of\nideas and the advancement of research.\n\n  The influence Montaigne had on Descartes has been commented upon by\nmany critics, at least from the XIXth century on, within the context of\nthe birth of modern science. As a sceptic, calling into question the\nnatural link between mind and things, Montaigne would have won his\nposition in the modern philosophical landscape.  The\nscepticism in the \u201cApologie\u201d is, no doubt, a main source\nof \u201csolipsism\u201d, but Descartes cannot be called a disciple\nof Montaigne in the sense that he would have inherited a\ndoctrine. Above all, he owes the P\u00e9rigourdin gentleman a way of\neducating himself. Far from substituting Montaigne for his Jesuit\nschoolteachers, Descartes decided to teach himself from scratch,\nfollowing the path indicated by Montaigne to achieve independence and\nfirmness of judgment. The mindset that Descartes inherited from the\nEssays appears as something particularly obvious, in the two\nfirst parts of the Discours de la m\u00e9thode. As the\nyoung Descartes left the Coll\u00e8ge de La Fl\u00e8che, he\ndecided to travel, and to test his own value in action. \u201cI\nemployed the rest of my youth to travel, to see courts and armies, to\nmeet people of varied humors and conditions, to collect varied\nexperiences, to try myself in the meetings that fortune was offering\n me (\u2026).\u201d[58]\n  Education, taken out of a school context, is presented as an essay\nof the self through experience. The world, as pedagogue, has been\nsubstituted for books and teachers. This new education allows\nDescartes to get rid of the prejudice of overrating his own customs, a\nwidespread phenomenon that we now call ethnocentrism. Montaigne\u2019s\nlegacy becomes particularly conspicuous when Descartes draws the\nlesson from his travels, \u201chaving acknowledged that those who have\nvery contrary feelings to ours are not barbarians or savages, but that\nmany of them make use of reason as much or more so than we\ndo\u201d. And also : \u201cIt is good to know something of different\npeople, in order to judge our own with more sanity, and not to think\nthat everything that is against our customs and habits is ridiculous\nand against reason, as usually do those who have never seen\n anything.\u201d[59]\n Like Montaigne, Descartes begins by philosophizing on life with no\nother device than the a discipline of judgment: \u201cI was\nlearning not to believe anything too firmly, of which I had been\npersuaded through example and\n custom.\u201d[60]\n He departs nevertheless from Montaigne when he will equate with error\nopinions that are grounded on\n custom.[61]\n The latter would not have dared to speak of error: varied opinions,\nhaving more or less authority, are to be weighed upon the scale of\njudgment. It is thus not correct to interpret Montaigne\u2019s philosophy\nas a \u201ccriticism of prejudice\u201d from a Cartesian\nstance. \n\nIn recent years, critics have stressed the importance of the\nconnection between Montaigne and Hobbes for the development of a\nmodern vision of politics, rooted in a criticism of traditional\ndoctrines of man and society. At the time when Shakespeare was writing\nhis plays, the first English translation of\nMontaigne\u2019s Essays by John Florio (1603) became a widely-read\nclassic in England. As a former student of Magdalen Hall (Oxford) and\nSaint John\u2019s College (Cambridge), and as a young tutor and secretary\nto aristocratic and wealthy families, Thomas Hobbes had many\nopportunities to read Montaigne in the libraries he frequented. In his\ncapacity as tutor, he traveled widely in Europe and spent several\nsojourns in France, before the English Civil War forced him into exile\nin Paris (1641\u20131651). During this period, Hobbes moved in skeptical\nand libertine circles and met scholars such as Sorbi\u00e8re, Gassendi, and\nLa Mothe Le Vayer, all influenced by a shared reference to Montaigne\u2019s\nskepticism. Historical documents and comparative research confirm the\nrelevance of Montaigne\u2019s influence on Hobbes\u2019s work, from Elements\nof Law to \n Leviathan.[62]\n The two authors share a\nphilosophical conception of man as driven by desire and imagination,\nand relentlessly striving for self-conservation and power. Montaigne\nidentified human life with movement and instability, and pointed to\nthe power that our passions have to push us toward imaginary future\naccomplishments (honor, glory, science, reason, and so \n on).[63]\n In Leviathan, Hobbes builds on this position to assert, as\na general inclination of all mankind, \u201ca perpetual and restless desire\nof power after power, that ceases only in \n death\u201d.[64]\n This shared\nanthropology shows the extent to which Montaigne and Hobbes refute the\nScholastic and Renaissance anthropocentric idea of man as a rational\nbeing at the summit of creation. On the contrary, they underline his\ninstinctive and passionate nature, which eventually leads to violence\nand conflict wherever the political community collapses. This negative\nanthropology is to be understood in the light of the historical\nexperience of the civil wars upsetting both their \n countries.[65]\n The threat of political turmoil imbued both Montaigne and Hobbes\u2019\nlives. Whereas Hobbes quoted the ancient saying homo homini\nlupus, and described the human condition outside the civil state\nas a war \u201cwhere every man is enemy to every\n man\u201d,[66]\n Montaigne seemed to\ngo further, \u201chaving learned by experience, from the cruelty of some\nChristians, that there is no beast in the world to be feared by man as\n man\u201d.[67]\n In order to avoid the outburst of violence, they both recognize\nthe necessity of laws and obedience, a necessity that does not rely on\nany ontological or moral foundation. The normative force of law\nresults from its practical necessity, as it is the rational condition\nof life in\n society.[68]\n As Montaigne wrote: \u201cNow laws remain in credit\nnot because they are just, but because they are\n laws\u201d.[69]\n Questioning the Aristotelian vision of politics as a natural goal for humanity,\nMontaigne and Hobbes pointed out the man-made nature of civil\nauthority, as founded in the need to preserve life and peace, avoiding\nviolence and war.\n7. Conclusion\nMontaigne cultivates his liberty by not adhering exclusively to any\none idea, while at the same time exploring them all. In exercising his\njudgment on various topics, he trains himself to go off on fresh\ntracks, starting from something he read or experienced.  For Montaigne\nthis also means calling into question the convictions of his time,\nreflecting upon his beliefs and education, and cultivating his own\npersonal thoughts. His language can be said to obey only one rule,\nthat is, to be \u201can effect of judgment and \nsincerity,\u201d[70]\n which is the very one that he demands from the pupil. His language \nbears an unmistakable\ntone but contradicts itself sometimes from one place to another,\nperhaps for the very reason that it follows so closely the movements\nof thought.\nIf being a philosopher means being insensitive to human frailties\nand to the evils or to the pleasures which befall us, then Montaigne\nis not a philosopher. If it means using a \u201cjargon\u201d, and\nbeing able to enter the world of scholars, then Montaigne is not one\neither. Yet, if being a philosopher is being able to judge properly in\nany circumstances of life, then the Essays are the exemplary testimony\nof an author who wanted to be a philosopher for good. Montaigne is\nputting his judgment to trial on whatever subject, in order not only\nto get to know its value, but also to form and strengthen it.\nHe manages thus to offer us a philosophy in accordance with life. As\nNietzsche puts it, \u201cthat such a man has written, joy on earth has truly\nincreased\u2026If my task were to make this earth a home, I would attach\nmyself to him.\u201d Or, as Stefan Zweig said, in a context which was closer\nto the historical reality experienced by Montaigne himself : \u201cMontaigne\nhelps us answer this one question: \u2018How to stay free? How to preserve\nour inborn clear-mindedness in front of all the threats and dangers of\nfanaticism, how to preserve the humanity of our hearts among the upsurge of\nbestiality?\u2019\u201d\n", "bibliography": {"categories": ["<a name=\"Edi\">Editions</a>", "<a name=\"TraEng\">Translations in English</a>", "<a name=\"SecSou\">Secondary Sources</a>"], "cat_ref_text": {"<a name=\"Edi\">Editions</a>": ["</h3>\n<ul class=\"hanging\">", "<em>Essais</em>, F.
