    "main_text": "Trope Applications || Tropes and Semantics\n4.4 Tropes and Semantics\n\nThat language furnishes the trope theorist with solid reasons for\nthinking that there are tropes has been indicated by several trope\ntheorists and it has also been forcefully argued, especially by\nFriederike Moltmann (2003, 2007, 2009, 2013a and\n2013b; cf. also Mertz 1996: 3\u20136). Taking\n(Mulligan et al. 1984) as her point of departure, Moltmann argues that\nnatural language contains several phenomena whose semantic treatment\nis best spelled out in terms of an ontology that includes tropes.\n\nNominalizations, first, may seem to point in the opposite\ndirection. For, in the classical discussion, the nominalization of\npredicates such as is wise into nouns fit to refer, has been\ntaken to count in favor of universal realism. A sub-class of\nnominalizations\u2014such as John\u2019s wisdom\u2014can,\nhowever, be taken to speak in favor of the existence of tropes. This\nis a kind of nominalization which, as Moltmann puts it,\n\u201cintroduce \u2018new\u2019 objects, but only partially\ncharacterize them\u201d (2007: 363). That these nominalizations refer\nto tropes rather than to states of affairs, she argues, can be seen\nonce we consider the vast range of adjectival modifiers they allow\nfor, modifiers only tropes and not states of affairs can be the\nrecipients of (2009: 62\u201363; cf. also her 2003).\n\nBare demonstratives, next, especially as they occur in\nso-called identificational sentences, provide another reason for\nthinking that tropes exist (Moltmann 2013a). In combination\nwith the preposition like\u2014as in Turquoise looks\nlike that\u2014they straightforwardly refer to tropes. But even\nin cases where they do not refer to tropes, tropes nevertheless\ncontribute to the semantics of sentences in which they figure. In\nparticular, tropes contribute to the meaning of sentences like\nThis is Mary or That is a beautiful woman. These are\nno ordinary identity statements. What makes them stand out, Moltmann\npoints out, is the exceptional neutrality of the demonstratives in\nsubject position. These sentences are best understood in such a way\nthat the bare demonstratives that figure in them do not refer to\nindividuals (like Mary), but rather to perceptual features (which\nMoltmann thinks of as tropes) in the situation at hand.\nIdentificational sentences, then, involve the identification of a\nbearer of a trope via the denotation (if not reference) of a\n(perceptual) trope.\n\nComparatives\u2014like John is happier than\nMary\u2014finally, are according to the received view such that\nthey refer to abstract objects that form a total ordering (so-called\ndegrees). According to Moltmann, a better way to understand these\nsorts of sentences is with reference to tropes. John is happier\nthan Mary should hence be understood as John\u2019s\nhappiness exceeds Mary\u2019s happiness. Moltmann thinks this\nway of understanding comparatives is preferable to the standard view,\nbecause tropes are easier to live with than \u201cabstract, rarely\nexplicit entities such as degrees or sets of degrees\u201d (Moltmann\n2009: 64).\n\nWhether nominalizations, bare demonstratives and/or comparatives\nsucceed in providing the trope theorist with strong reasons to think\ntropes exist will, among other things, depend on whether or not they\nreally do manage to distinguish between tropes and states of affairs.\nMoltmann thinks they do but, again, this depends on how one\nunderstands the nature of the items in question. It will also depend\non if and how one thinks goings on at the linguistic level can tell us\nanything much about what there is at the ontological level. According\nto quite a few trope theorists (cf. esp. Heil 2003), we\nshould avoid arguing from the way we conceptualize reality to\nconclusions about the nature of reality itself. Depending on\none\u2019s take on the relationship between language and world,\ntherefore, semantics might turn out to have precious little to say\nabout the existence (or not) of tropes.\n",
