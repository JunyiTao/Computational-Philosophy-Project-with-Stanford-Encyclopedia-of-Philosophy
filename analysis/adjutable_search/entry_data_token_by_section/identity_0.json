Introduction\n\nTo say that things are identical is to say that they are the same.\n\u201cIdentity\u201d and \u201csameness\u201d mean the same; their\nmeanings are identical. However, they have more than one meaning. A\ndistinction is customarily drawn between qualitative and\nnumerical identity or sameness. Things with qualitative\nidentity share properties, so things can be more or less qualitatively\nidentical. Poodles and Great Danes are qualitatively identical because\nthey share the property of being a dog, and such properties as go\nalong with that, but two poodles will (very likely) have greater\nqualitative identity. Numerical identity requires absolute, or total,\nqualitative identity, and can only hold between a thing and itself.\nIts name implies the controversial view that it is the only identity\nrelation in accordance with which we can properly count (or number)\nthings: x and y are to be properly counted as one\njust in case they are numerically identical (Geach 1973).\n\nNumerical identity is our topic. As noted, it is at the centre of\nseveral philosophical debates, but to many seems in itself wholly\nunproblematic, for it is just that relation everything has to itself\nand nothing else \u2013 and what could be less problematic than that?\nMoreover, if the notion is problematic it is difficult to see how the\nproblems could be resolved, since it is difficult to see how a thinker\ncould have the conceptual resources with which to explain the concept\nof identity whilst lacking that concept itself. The basicness of the\nnotion of identity in our conceptual scheme, and, in particular, the\nlink between identity and quantification has been particularly noted\nby Quine (1964).\n",
