    "main_text": "Difficulties with the Theory and Possible Solutions || The congruence problem\n5.4 The congruence problem\n\nA further objection to the identity theory, going back to an\nobservation of Strawson\u2019s, takes its cue from the point that\ncanonical names of propositions and of facts are often not\nstraightforwardly congruent with one another: they are often not\nintersubstitutable salva congruitate (or, if they are, they\nmay not be intersubstitutable salva veritate) (Strawson 1971:\n196; cf. K\u00fcnne 2003: 10\u201312). For example, we say that\npropositions are true, not that they obtain, whereas we say that facts\nobtain, not that they are true. How serious is this point? The\nobjection in effect presupposes that for two expressions to be\nco-referential, or satisfied by one and the same thing, they must be\nsyntactically congruent, have the same truth-value potential, and\nmatch in terms of general contextual suitability. The assumption of\nthe syntactic congruence of co-referential expressions is\ncontroversial, and it may be possible for the identity theorist simply\nto deny it (see Gaskin 2008: 106\u201310, for argument on the point,\nwith references to further literature; cf. Dodd 2008a: 83\u20136.).\nWhether co-referential expressions must be syntactically congruent\ndepends on one\u2019s conception of reference, a matter that cannot\nbe further pursued here (for discussion see Gaskin 2008: ch. 2; 2020:\nchs. 3\u20135).\n\nThere has been a good deal of discussion in the literature concerning\nthe question whether an identification of facts with true propositions\nis undermined not specifically by phenomena of syntactic\nincongruence but rather by failure of relevant intersubstitutions to\npreserve truth-values (see, e.g., King 2007: ch. 5; King in\nKing, Soames, & Speaks 2014: 64\u201370, 201\u20138; Hofweber\n2016: 215\u201323; Candlish & Damnjanovic 2018: 264). The\ndiscussion has focused on examples like the following:\n\n(17)\n Daniel remembers the fact that this is a leap year;\n\n\n(18)\n Daniel remembers the true proposition that this is a leap\nyear;\n\n\n(19)\n The fact that my local baker has shut down is just\nappalling;\n\n\n(20)\n The true proposition that my local baker has shut down is just\nappalling.\n\n\nThe problem here is said to be that the substitution of \u201ctrue\nproposition\u201d for \u201cfact\u201d or vice versa generates\ndifferent readings (in particular, readings with different\ntruth-values). Suppose Daniel has to memorize a list of true\npropositions, of which one is the proposition that this is a leap\nyear. Then it is contended that we can easily imagine a scenario in\nwhich (17) and (18) differ in truth-value. Another way of putting the\nsame point might be to say that (17) is equivalent to\n\n(21)\n Daniel remembers that this is a leap year,\n\n\nbut that (18) is not equivalent to (21), because\u2014so the argument\ngoes\u2014(18) but not (21) would be true if Daniel had memorized his\nlist of true propositions without realizing that they were\ntrue. Similar differences can be argued to apply, mutatis\nmutandis, to (19) and (20). Can the identity theorist deal with\nthis difficulty?\n\nIn the first place one might suggest that the alleged mismatch between\n(17) and (18) is less clear than the objector claims. (17) surely does\nhave a reading like the one that is said to be appropriate for (18).\nSuppose Daniel has to memorize a list of facts. (17) could then\ndiverge in truth-value from\n\n(22)\n Daniel remembers the fact that this is a leap year as a\nfact.\n\n\nFor there is a reading of (17) on which, notwithstanding (17)\u2019s\ntruth, (22) is false: this is the reading on which Daniel has indeed\nmemorized a list of facts, but without necessarily realizing that the\nthings he is memorizing are facts. He has memorized the\nrelevant fact (that this is a leap year), we might say, but not\nas a fact. That is parallel to the reading of (18) according\nto which Daniel has memorized the true proposition that this is a leap\nyear, but not as a true proposition. The identity theorist\nmight then aver that, perhaps surprisingly, the same point actually\napplies to the simple (21), on the grounds that this sentence can mean\nthat Daniel remembers the propositional object that this is a leap\nyear (from a list of such objects, say, that he has been asked to\nmemorize), with no implication that he remembers it either as a\nproposition or as a fact. So, according to this\nresponse, the transparent reading of (18)\u2014which has Daniel\nremember the propositional object, namely that this is a leap\nyear, but not necessarily remember it as a fact, or even\nas the propositional object that this is a leap year (he\nremembers it under some other mode of presentation)\u2014is also\navailable for (17) and for (21).\n\nWhat about the opaque reading of either (17) or (21), which implies\nthat Daniel knows for a fact that this is a leap\nyear\u2014is that reading available for (18) too? The identity\ntheorist might maintain that this reading is indeed available, and\nthen explain why we tend not to use sentences like (18) in the\nrelevant sense, preferring sentences of the form of (17) or (21), on\nthe basis of the relative technicality of the vocabulary of (18). The\nidea would be that it is just an accident of language that we prefer\neither (17) or (21) to (18) where what is in question is the sense\nthat implies that Daniel has propositional knowledge that this is a\nleap year (is acquainted with that fact as a fact), as opposed to\nhaving mere acquaintance, under some mode of presentation or other,\nwith the propositional object which happens to be (the fact) that\nthis is a leap year. And if we ask why we prefer (17) or (21)\nto\n\n(23)\n Daniel remembers the proposition that this is a leap year,\n\n\nthen the answer will be the Gricean one that (23) conveys less\ninformation than (17) or (21), under the reading of these two\nsentences that we are usually interested in, according to which Daniel\nremembers the relevant fact as a fact, for (23) is compatible with the\nfalsity of \u201cThis is a leap year\u201d. Hence to use (23) in a\nsituation where one was in a position to use (17) or (21) would carry\na misleading conversational implicature. That, at any rate, is one\npossible line for the identity theorist to take. (It is worth noting\nhere that, if the identity theorist is right about this, it will\nfollow that the \u201cknow that\u201d construction will be subject\nto a similar ambiguity as the \u201cremember that\u201d\nconstruction, given that remembering is a special case of knowing.\nThat is: \u201cA knows that p\u201d will mean\neither \u201cA is acquainted with the fact that\np, and is acquainted with it as a fact\u201d or\nmerely \u201cA is acquainted with the fact that\np, but not necessarily with it as\nsuch\u2014either as a fact or even as a propositional\nobject\u201d.)\n",
