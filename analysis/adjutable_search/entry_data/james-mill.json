    "preamble": "\nJames Mill (1773\u20131836) was a Scots-born political philosopher, historian, psychologist, educational theorist, economist, and legal, political and penal reformer. Well-known and highly regarded in his day, he is now all but forgotten. Mill\u2019s reputation now rests mainly on two biographical facts. The first is that his first-born son was John Stuart Mill, who became even more eminent than his father. The second is that the elder Mill was the collaborator and ally of Jeremy Bentham, whose subsequent reputation also eclipsed the elder Mill\u2019s. Our aim here is to try, insofar as possible, to remove Mill from these two large shadows and to reconsider him as a formidable thinker in his own right.\nMill\u2019s range of interests was remarkably wide, extending from education and psychology in his two-volume Analysis of the Phenomena of the Human Mind (1829a), to political economy (he persuaded his friend David Ricardo to write on that subject, as Mill himself did in his Elements of Political Economy, 1821), to penology and prison reform, to the law and history, and, not least, to political philosophy. On these and other subjects he wrote five books and more than a thousand essays and reviews. It is with Mill the political philosopher and educational theorist that the present article is principally concerned.\n",

    "main_text": "\n1. Biography\nUnlike his famous first-born son, James Mill never wrote an autobiography or even a sketch of his early life, the details of which remained unknown even to his children. What we do know is this. James Mill was born on 6 April 1773 at Northwater Bridge in the county of Forfarshire in the parish of Logie Pert in Scotland. His father, James Milne, was a shoemaker and small farmer of modest means who was quiet, mild-mannered, and devout. His mother, Isabel Fenton Milne, was a more forceful figure. Determined that her first-born son should get ahead in the world, she changed the family name from the Scottish \u201cMilne\u201d to the more English-sounding \u201cMill,\u201d and kept young James away from other children, demanding that he spend most of his waking hours immersed in study. His \u201csole occupation,\u201d as his biographer Alexander Bain remarks, \u201cwas study\u201d (Bain 1882, 7). (A regimen rather like that imposed by his mother upon her eldest son was later to be imposed upon his first-born son, John Stuart Mill.) In this occupation young James clearly excelled. Before the age of seven he had shown a talent for elocution, composition, and arithmetic, as well as Latin and Greek. The local minister saw to it that James received special attention at the parish school. At age ten or eleven, he was sent to Montrose Academy, where his teachers \u201cwere always overflowing with the praises of Mill\u2019s cleverness and perseverance\u201d (Bain 1882, 8). Before leaving Montrose Academy at the age of seventeen, Mill was persuaded by the parish minister and his mother to study for the ministry. Mill\u2019s decision evidently pleased Lady Jane Stuart, wife of Sir John Stuart of Fettercairn, who headed a local charity founded for the purpose of educating poor but bright boys for the Presbyterian ministry. Mill, eminently qualified in both respects, became the recipient of Lady Jane\u2019s largesse. As it happened, she and Sir John were just then looking for a tutor for their fourteen-year old daughter Wilhelmina. They offered the job to James Mill; he accepted; and when the Stuart family moved to Edinburgh, he accompanied them.\nIn 1790, Mill enrolled in the University of Edinburgh, where by day he pursued a full course of studies and in the evenings tutored young Wilhelmina. Each experience left its mark. The Scottish universities at Edinburgh and Glasgow (and to a lesser extent Aberdeen and St. Andrews) had earlier been the hub of the Scottish Enlightenment and were still the premier universities in Britain. They had numbered among their faculty such luminaries as Francis Hutcheson, Thomas Reid, John Millar, Adam Ferguson, Adam Smith, and\u2014had the orthodox town council of Edinburgh not forbade his admission\u2014would have included David Hume as well. At Edinburgh Mill took particular delight in the tutelage of Dugald Stewart, who carried on the tradition of Scottish moral philosophy. In addition to moral philosophy, Mill\u2019s course of studies included history, political economy, and the classics, including Mill\u2019s favorite philosopher, Plato (Loizides 2013a, ch. 3; Loizides 2013b). Mill\u2019s mind never lost the stamp of his Scottish education (Cumming 1962). As his eldest son was later to remark, James Mill was \u201cthe last survivor of this great school\u201d (J.S. Mill 1843, 566).\nFrom 1790 to 1794 Mill served young Wilhelmina Stuart not only as a teacher but as a companion and confidant. Her admiration for her tutor quite likely turned to love, and the feeling was apparently reciprocated. But, however promising his prospects, Mill was no aristocrat, a social fact which he was not allowed to forget. In 1797 Wilhelmina married a member of her own class, Sir William Forbes (to the disappointment of Walter Scott, not least). Wilhelmina died in 1810, soon after the birth of her second son. She was said to have called out Mill\u2019s name \u201cwith her last breath.\u201d Mill never forgot her; he spoke of her always with wistful affection and named his first-born daughter after her in 1809. But this was not the only incident worthy of note in the Mill-Forbes family affair. In July 1806, soon after the birth of John Stuart Mill (named in honor of Mill\u2019s Scottish patron), the first of nine children, Mill challenged Forbes to \u201ca fair race \u2026 in the education of a son.\u201d The \u201ccontest\u201d would be decided \u201ctwenty years hence.\u201d Should Mill\u2019s be \"the most accomplished & virtuous young man\" of the two first-born sons, the proud father confessed, \u201cI shall not envy you that you can have yours the richest\u201d (Mill to Forbes, 1806). Ironically, twenty years later, the virtuous son would fall in a state of dejection, forcing him to question the efficacy of the father\u2019s scheme of education.\nAfter completing his first degree in 1794, Mill began studying for the ministry. For the next four years he supported himself by tutoring the sons and daughters of several noble families. One such family even set up a small pension which complemented Mill\u2019s income for years (Lazenby 1972, 309). Yet, the experience was not a happy one. For repeatedly forgetting his \u201cplace\u201d in \u201cpolite society\u201d he suffered one insult after another. He harbored ever after an abiding hatred for an hereditary aristocracy.\nBy the time he was licensed to preach in 1798 Mill had apparently begun to lose his faith and had by the early 1800s become restless and disillusioned. In 1802, at age twenty-nine, he left for London in hopes of improving his situation. For some years thereafter he worked as an independent author, journalist and editor. From 1802 until his appointment as an assistant examiner of correspondence at the East India Company in 1819 Mill\u2019s literary labors were prodigious. Besides some 1,400 editorials, he wrote hundreds of substantial articles and reviews, as well as several books, including his History of British India in three large volumes. Although some of these were doubtless labors of love, most were labors of necessity, for Mill had to support himself and his wife Harriet, whom he married in 1805, and a fast-growing family.\n2. Alliance with Bentham\nIn late 1807 or early 1808 James Mill met Jeremy Bentham, with whom he soon formed a political and philosophical alliance. The two were in some respects kindred spirits. Both wished and worked for religious toleration and legal reform; both favored freedom of speech and press; both feared that the failure to reform the British political system\u2014by, among other things, eliminating rotten boroughs and extending the franchise\u2014would give rise to reactionary intransigence on the one hand, and revolutionary excess on the other. But the two men were of vastly different temperaments and backgrounds. Bentham, a wealthy bachelor, was an eccentric genius and closet philosopher. The poor, harried and hard-working Mill was the more practical and worldly partner in that peculiar partnership. He was also a much clearer writer and more persuasive propagandist for the Utilitarian cause.\nBentham believed that the pursuit of pleasure and the avoidance of pain were the twin aims of all human action. His philosophy, Utilitarianism, held that self-interest\u2014understood as pleasure or happiness\u2014should be \u201cmaximized\u201d and pain \u201cminimized\u201d (Bentham, incidentally, coined both terms). And, as with individual self-interest, so too with the public interest. According to Bentham, the aim of legislation and public policy was to promote \u201cthe greatest happiness of the greatest number.\u201d Mill agreed, after a fashion. Formerly a dour Scots Presbyterian and still something of a Platonist, he took a dim view of unalloyed hedonism. Like Plato, he ranked the pleasures in a hierarchy, with the sensual pleasures subordinated to the intellectual ones.\nDespite their differences, Mill proved to be Bentham\u2019s most valuable ally. A better writer and abler advocate, Mill helped to make Bentham\u2019s ideas and schemes more palatable and popular than they might otherwise have been. But he also influenced Bentham\u2019s ideas in a number of ways. For one, Mill led Bentham to appreciate the importance of economic factors in explaining and changing social life and political institutions; for another, he turned Bentham away from advocating aristocratic \u201ctop-down\u201d reform into a more popular or \u201cdemocratic\u201d direction. For a time their partnership proved fruitful. With Mill\u2019s energy and Bentham\u2019s ideas and financial backing, Utilitarian schemes for legal, political, penal, and educational reform gained an ever wider audience and circle of adherents. This circle included, among others, Francis Place (\u201cthe radical tailor of Charing Cross\u201d), the Genevan Etienne Dumont, the historian George Grote, the stockbroker-turned-economist David Ricardo, and\u2014certainly not least\u2014the young John Stuart Mill. Each in his own way enlisted in the Utilitarian cause. The cause was furthered by the founding of the Society for the Diffusion of Useful Knowledge and, later, by the launching of the Westminster Review and the founding of University College London (where Bentham\u2019s body, stuffed and mounted in a glass case, can still be seen today). This small band of \u201cphilosophic radicals\u201d worked tirelessly for political changes, several of which were later incorporated into the Reform Act of 1832. But Bentham and Mill became increasingly estranged. Bentham was irascible and difficult to work with, and Mill on more than one occasion swallowed his pride by accepting financial support and suffering personal rebuke from his senior partner.\nIn 1818, after twelve years\u2019 work, Mill\u2019s massive History of British India was published. Early in the following year he was appointed Assistant Examiner at the East India Company. His financial future finally secured, Mill no longer needed Bentham\u2019s largesse. The two men saw less and less of each other. Their political alliance continued even as their personal relationship cooled. Their uneasy friendship effectively ended some years before Bentham\u2019s death in 1832.\nBesides being a tireless reformer and prolific writer, James Mill supplied his son John with one of the most strenuous educations ever recorded in the annals of pedagogy. The elder Mill gave young John daily lessons in Latin, Greek, French, history, philosophy, and political economy. Literature and poetry were also taught, although with less enthusiasm (James Mill, like Plato, distrusted poets and poetry). John was in turn expected to tutor his younger brothers and sisters in these subjects. Each was examined rigorously and regularly by their unforgiving father, and the nine children, like their mother, lived with in fear of his rebuke. As John Stuart Mill later wrote, \u201cI \u2026 grew up in the absence of love and in the presence of fear\u201d (J.S. Mill 1873, 612).\nMill\u2019s strained relations with his wife and children stand in stark contrast with his warm and cordial relations with others, and most especially the young men who sought him out for the pleasure of his company and the vigor of his conversation. As John Black, the editor of the Morning Chronicle, recalled on the occasion of Mill\u2019s death in 1836:\nMr. Mill was eloquent and impressive in conversation. He had a great command of language, which bore the stamp of his earnest and energetic character. Young men were particularly fond of his society \u2026 No man could enjoy his society without catching a portion of his elevated enthusiasm \u2026 His conversation was so energetic and complete in thought, so succinct, and exact \u2026 in expression, that, if reported as uttered, his colloquial observations or arguments would have been perfect compositions (quoted in Bain 1882, 457).\nUnfortunately the same cannot be said of Mill\u2019s writings, which tend to be both dry and didactic.\n3. Mill\u2019s Writings\nJames Mill always attempted to write, he said, with \u201cmanly plainness,\u201d and in that endeavor he certainly succeeded. The reader is never at a loss to know just what his views are or where his sympathies lie. Mill\u2019s manly plainness is especially evident in his massive three-volume History of British India, which begins with a remarkable preface in which he asserts that his objectivity is guaranteed by the fact that he has never visited India. His is, he says, a \u201ccritical, or judging history,\u201d and his judgments on Hindu customs and practices are particularly harsh (Mill 1818, I, x). He denounces their \u201crude\u201d and \u201cbackward\u201d culture for its cultivation of ignorance and its veneration of superstition, and leaves no doubt that he favors a strong dose of Utilitarian rationalism as an antidote. Although his History is in part a Utilitarian treatise and in part a defense of British intervention in Indian affairs, it is more than the sum of those two parts. Mill\u2019s History shows, perhaps more clearly than any of his other works, the continuing influence of his Scottish education (Rendall, 1982). The criteria according to which Mill judges and criticizes Indian practices and customs derive from the view of historical progress that he had learned from Dugald Stewart and John Millar, amongst others. According to this view \u201cman is a progressive being\u201d and education is the chief engine of progress. And this in turn helps to explain not only Mill\u2019s harsh judgments on the Hindus but his continually reiterated emphasis on education (Mill 1992, 139\u201384).\nVirtually everything that James Mill ever wrote had a pedagogical purpose. He was a relentlessly didactic writer whose most important essays\u2014Government and Education, in particular\u2014take the form of clipped, concise, deductive arguments (De Marchi 1983). It is a style which his contemporaries either admired or detested, as can be seen for instance in F. D. Maurice\u2019s novel Eustace Conway. When the Benthamite Morton discovers Eustace reading Mill\u2019s Essay on Government, he asks his opinion of Mill. Eustace replies:\n\u201cI think him nearly the most wonderful prose-writer in our language.\u201d\n\u201cThat do not I,\u201d says Morton. \u201cI approve the matter of his treatises exceedingly, but the style seems to me detestable.\u201d\n\u201cOh!,\u201d says Eustace, \u201cI cannot separate matter and style \u2026 My reason for delighting in this book is, that it gives such a fixedness and reality to all that was most vaguely brilliant in my speculations\u2014it converts dreams into demonstrations\u201d (quoted in Thomas 1969, 255\u201356).\n\nMany of Mill\u2019s readers were not so gentle. Thomas Babington Macaulay criticized Mill and his fellow Utilitarians for \u201caffect[ing] a quakerly plainness, or rather a cynical negligence and impurity of style.\u201d In so doing,\nthey surrender their understandings \u2026 to the meanest and most abject sophisms, provided those sophisms come before them disguised with the externals of demonstration. They do not seem to know that logic has its illusions as well as rhetoric,\u2014that a fallacy may lurk in a syllogism as well as in a metaphor (Macaulay 1992, 272\u201373).\nBut if Mill\u2019s style of reasoning and writing was plain and unadorned, it was at least clear and cogent. And that, surely, is a virtue too often lacking among political theorists.\nAnd indeed James Mill regarded himself as a theorist, which was, for him, a title to be worn proudly. Theory, he wrote, gives a \u201ccommanding view\u201d of its subject and serves as a guide for improving practice. Theory precedes practice or \u201cexperience\u201d and is not simply derived from it. Amidst the often contradictory welter of appearance, theory functions a priori, serving as a reliable weather vane and guide (Mill 1992, 141). This view of theory is much in evidence in all his writings, and in his political essays in particular. The most important of these\u2014and the most controversial\u2014is Government.\n4. The Essay on Government\nWhether justly or not, Mill\u2019s modern reputation as a political theorist rests on a single essay. The Essay on Government, Mill later wrote, was meant to serve as a \u201ccomprehensive outline\u201d or \u201cskeleton map\u201d with whose aid one could find one\u2019s way across the vast, varied, and ofttimes confusing and dangerous terrain of politics (Mill 1820). Government, Mill maintains, is merely a means to an end, viz. the happiness of the whole community and the individuals composing it. We should begin by assuming that every human being is motivated by a desire to experience pleasure and to avoid pain. Pleasures and pains come from two sources, our fellow human beings and nature. Government is concerned directly with the first and indirectly with the second: \u201cIts business is to increase to the utmost the pleasures, and diminish to the utmost the pains, which men derive from one another.\u201d Yet, \u201cthe primary cause of government\u201d is to be found in nature itself, since humans must wrest from nature \u201cthe scanty materials of happiness\u201d (Mill 1992, 4\u20135). Nature and human nature combine to make government necessary. It is man\u2019s nature not only to desire happiness but to satisfy that desire by investing as little effort as possible. Labor being the means of obtaining happiness, and our own labor being painful to us, we will, if permitted, live off the labor of others. To the degree that others enjoy the fruits of my labor, my primary incentive for working\u2014namely my own happiness\u2014is diminished if not destroyed.\nTherefore, Mill continues, the primary problem in designing workable political institutions is to maximize the happiness of the community by minimizing the extent to which some of its members may encroach upon, and enjoy, the fruits of other people\u2019s labor. This cannot happen, Mill maintains, in a monarchy (wherein a single ruler exploits his subjects) or in an aristocracy (wherein a ruling elite exploits the common people). Nor can communal happiness be maximized in a direct democracy, since the time and effort required for ruling would be subtracted from that available for engaging in productive labor (Mill 1992, 7\u20139). The only system that serves as a means to the end of individual and communal happiness is representative democracy, wherein citizens elect representatives to deliberate and legislate on their behalf and in their interest. The problem immediately arises, however, as to how representatives can be made to rule on the people\u2019s behalf rather than their own. Mill\u2019s answer is that frequent elections and short terms in office make it unlikely that elected representatives will legislate only for their own benefit. After all, representatives are drawn from the ranks of the people to which they can, after their term in office ends, expect to return. Given what we might nowadays call the incentive structure of representative government, representatives have every reason to promote the people\u2019s interests instead of their own. Indeed, in a properly structured system, there will be an \u201cidentity of interests\u201d between representatives and the electorate (Mill 1992, 22).\n4.1 Mill on Representation\nMill\u2019s views on representation stand mid-way between two opposing views. On the one side are Jean-Jacques Rousseau and other \u201cparticipatory\u201d theorists who argue that to allow anyone to represent you or your interests is tantamount to forfeiting your liberty. On the other side are assorted Whig defenders of \u201cvirtual representation\u201d\u2014including Edmund Burke and, later, Mill\u2019s contemporaries Sir James Mackintosh and T. B. Macaulay\u2014who contend that representatives elected by the few may best represent the interests of the many. On their view, one need not have a voice\u2014or a vote\u2014to be well represented in Parliament.\nAgainst Rousseau and other opponents of representation tout court Mill maintains that representative government is \u201cthe grand discovery of modern times,\u201d inasmuch as it allows the interests of the many to be represented efficiently and expeditiously by the few\u2014so long, that is, as the many have the vote in order to register their views and can moreover hold the few strictly accountable for their actions while in office. Properly structured, such a system serves to enhance liberty, since it frees most people from the burdensome and time-consuming business of governing, thereby allowing them to get on with their more productive individual pursuits and, most especially, their productive labors (Mill 1992, 21).\nBut it was against Tory and Whigs who defended \u201cvirtual representation\u201d and advocated slow and piecemeal reform of the representative system that Mill\u2019s main arguments were directed. He holds that the very idea of virtual representation is a recipe for misgovernment, corruption, and the triumph of the aristocratic or \u201csinister interests\u201d of the few at the expense of the many. The public interest can be represented only in so far as the public, or a considerably enlarged portion thereof, has the vote. Mill is a radical individualist in that he insists that each person is the best, perhaps indeed the only, judge of what his own interests are. And if\u2014as he also insists\u2014the public interest is the sum of all individual non-sinister interests, it follows that the wider the franchise, the more truly representative the government. Mill deemed any defense of a greatly restricted franchise and virtual representation to be arguments against representative government itself. Pace Ricardo, Mill had not really managed to avoid giving Government \u201cthe appearance of an essay on Reform of Parliament\u201d (Ricardo 1820, 211).\n4.2 The Meritocratic \u201cMiddle Rank\u201d\nMill\u2019s view that each individual is the best judge of his own interests appears to stand in stark contrast with his praise and apparent privileging of one particular collectivity\u2014the \u201cmiddle rank, \u2026 that intelligent, that virtuous rank \u2026 which gives to science, to art, and to legislation itself, their most distinguished ornaments, and is the chief source of all that has exalted and refined human nature\u2026\u201d It is to this middle rank\u2014the forerunner of the modern \u201cmeritocracy\u201d\u2014that common laborers look for advice and guidance, especially in moral and political matters (Mill 1992, 41\u201342). Although such remarks have struck many modern commentators as a militant defense of middle class power and privilege, it is, in fact, nothing of the sort. Mill rarely uses the phrase \u201cmiddle class,\u201d preferring instead the more archaic \u201cmiddle rank.\u201d And this, once again, underscores the continuing importance of Mill\u2019s Scottish education. The notion of \u201cranks,\u201d as analyzed at length in John Millar\u2019s Origin of the Distinction of Ranks (1806), had left a deep impression. Millar\u2019s (and Mill\u2019s) \u201cranks\u201d are not (quite) \u201cclasses\u201d in our modern sense\u2014that is, purely descriptive, fairly distinct, and normatively neutral socio-economic entities\u2014but are instead meant to pick out people of particular intellectual merit and to mark gradations of moral and civic influence.\nMill is quite careful to distinguish between a \u201cclass\u201d and a \u201crank.\u201d The members of a \u201cclass\u201d are united by shared (and usually selfish or \u201csinister\u201d) interests. Members of the \u201cmiddle rank,\u201d by contrast, are marked more by their education, intellect, and public-spiritedness than by their wealth or any other social or economic characteristics. They are \u201cuniversally described as both the most wise and the most virtuous part of the community which\u201d\u2014Mill adds acidulously\u2014\u201cis not the Aristocratical [class]\u201d (Mill 1992, 41). Members of the middle rank owe their position not to accident of birth but to \u201cthe present state of education, and the diffusion of knowledge\u201d among those anxious to acquire it. By these lights the \u201cradical tailor\u201d Francis Place, the stockbroker David Ricardo, the wealthy philanthropist Jeremy Bentham, the Quaker editor William Allen, and even James Mill himself\u2014although not all \u201cmiddle class\u201d by modern standards\u2014belonged to the esteemed middle rank. Clearly, then, the idea of a middle rank cuts across the kinds of class divisions with which we are familiar today. Hence any attempt to classify Mill as an apologist for \u201cthe middle-class\u201d simpliciter is anachronistic and rather wide of the mark. He is instead an early defender, avant la lettre, of the idea of a meritocracy whose members are drawn from all classes and walks of life.\n4.3 The Reception of Government\nThe idea that Mill was an apologist for middle-class interests was, of course, a later development. But what of his contemporaries\u2019 views of the Essay on Government? For so short an essay, Mill\u2019s Government proved to be remarkably controversial in his own day. Tories and Whigs thought its message wildly and even dangerously democratic, while many of Mill\u2019s fellow Utilitarians\u2014including Bentham, John Stuart Mill, and William Thompson\u2014believed that he did not go nearly far enough in advocating an extension of the franchise. Although more \u201cdemocratic\u201d in private discussion, Mill publicly advocated extending the franchise to include all male heads of household over the age of forty, leaving them to speak for and represent the interests of younger men and all women:\nOne thing is pretty clear, that all those individuals whose interests are indisputably included in those of other individuals, may be struck off without inconvenience. In this light may be viewed all children, up to a certain age, whose interests are involved in those of their parents. In this light, also, women may be regarded, the interest of almost all of whom is involved either in that of their fathers or in that of their husbands (Mill 1992, 27).\nThis, his eldest son later remarked, was \u201cthe worst [paragraph] he ever wrote\u201d (J.S. Mill 1961, 98). Most of Mill\u2019s critics were quick to seize upon it, if only because its conclusion contradicts two of Mill\u2019s oft-stated premises, namely that each of us is the best judge of our own interests and that anyone having unchecked power is bound to abuse it. As William Thompson argued in Appeal of One Half the Human Race (1825), Mill\u2019s premises pointed to the widest possible extension of the franchise, and not to the exclusion of \u201cone half the human race,\u201d viz. all women.\n4.4 Macaulay\u2019s \u201cFamous Attack\u201d\nAlways the critic, Mill was himself a frequent target of criticism, much of which came from quarters hostile to the kinds of sweeping reforms favored by Bentham and the philosophic radicals. Mill\u2019s Essay on Government first appeared in 1820, and was subsequently reprinted in editions of his Essays in 1823, 1825, and 1828, which reached an ever wider audience, including (Mill boasted) \u201cthe young men of the Cambridge Union.\u201d Fearing that the cause of moderate reform was in danger from Mill and the philosophic radicals, Whig polemicists weighed in against Mill. One of them, Sir James Mackintosh (1765\u20131832), was an old Whig stalwart with a plodding and ofttimes pompous prose style. The other, T. B. Macaulay (1800\u20131859), was a much younger and altogether more formidable foe.\nMacaulay\u2019s \u201cMill on Government,\u201d published in the March 1829 issue of The Edinburgh Review, is a remarkable mixture of logical criticism, irony, mordant wit, and droll parody. That Mill\u2019s Essay on Government is remembered at all today doubtless owes something to Macaulay\u2019s memorable critique. The most remarkable feature of Macaulay\u2019s critique is that it seems to be largely aloof from particular political issues, focusing instead on what we would nowadays call methodological matters. Against his older adversary the twenty-eight-year-old Macaulay defends the \u201chistorical\u201d or \u201cinductive\u201d approach to the study of politics against Mill\u2019s abstract, ahistorical, and \u201cdeductive\u201d method. Macaulay maintains that we learn more from \u201cexperience\u201d than from \u201ctheory,\u201d and had best beware of the simplifications and \u201csophisms\u201d to be found in Mill\u2019s Essay on Government. The most pernicious of these is the \u201claw\u201d that men act always on the basis of self-interest. This law, Macaulay counters, is either trivially true (because logically circular) or patently false; in either case it hardly suffices as a foundation upon which to erect an argument for radical reform, much less a comprehensive theory of politics. And if Mill\u2019s deductive logic fails, the entire edifice\u2014including his supposedly \u201cscientific\u201d arguments in favor of radical reform\u2014collapses with it (Macaulay 1992).\nThat James Mill, fierce polemicist that he was, did not respond quickly and with no holds barred seems surprising, to say the least. His eldest son offers one possible explanation. In his Autobiography J. S. Mill remarks that \u201cI was not at all satisfied with the mode in which my father met the criticisms of Macaulay. He did not, as I thought he ought to have done, justify himself by saying, \u2018I was not writing a scientific treatise on polities. I was writing an article for parliamentary reform\u2019. He treated Macaulay\u2019s argument as simply irrational; an attack upon the reasoning faculty; an example of the saying of Hobbes, that when reason is against a man, a man will be against reason (J.S. Mill 1873, 165, 167).\u201d\nYet the younger Mill\u2019s account of his father\u2019s reaction to Macaulay\u2019s \u201cfamous attack\u201d (as the son later described it) is misleading in at least two respects. In the first place, James Mill did not, and given his own premises could not, distinguish between a \u201cscientific treatise on politics\u201d and a coherent and compelling argument for \u201cparliamentary reform.\u201d For he believed that any reforms that were workable and worth having could be based only on an adequately scientific theory of politics. The Essay on Government was intended to be both, if only in brief outline. Moreover, the younger Mill leaves the impression that his father, although angered by the attack, never replied to Macaulay. But this is untrue.\nFor a time James Mill tried, without success, to persuade his friend and fellow Benthamite Etienne Dumont to reply to \u201cthe curly-headed coxcomb, who only abuses what he does not understand\u201d (Mill to Dumont, 1829b). In the meantime there appeared Sir James Mackintosh\u2019s Dissertation on Ethical Philosophy (1830) in which Mill\u2019s Essay on Government was singled out for special censure. There was nothing new in this; but what caught Mill\u2019s eye was that Mackintosh\u2019s mode and manner of argument was borrowed, as the author acknowledged, from \u201cthe writer of a late criticism on Mr. Mill\u2019s Essay.\u2014See Edinburgh Review, No. 97, March 1829.\u201d \u201cThis,\u201d says Mill with evident relish, \u201cis convenient; because the answer, which does for Sir James, will answer the same purpose with the Edinburgh Review\u201d (Mill 1992, 305). Of course, the \u201cwriter of a late criticism\u201d to whom Mackintosh refers was none other than Macaulay, whom the elder Mill then proceeds to answer in the guise of replying to Mackintosh.\nIn his reply Mill reiterates and defends the arguments advanced in his Essay on Government: all men\u2014including rulers and representatives\u2014are moved mainly if not exclusively by considerations of self-interest, and therefore the only security for good government is to be found in making the interests of representatives identical with those of their constituents. But, unlike the cool, detached, and ostensibly deductive Essay on Government, Mill\u2019s reply contains a good deal of vitriol. He writes like a schoolmaster who, having lost all patience with a slow-witted pupil, is content to ridicule him before his cleverer classmates. The sight is not a pretty one, and shows James Mill at his polemical worst. Whether, or to what extent, such a splenetic rejoinder could suffice as a refutation is surely questionable.\n5. Other Related Writings\nAlthough none of Mill\u2019s other essays\u2014save, perhaps, \u201cThe Church, and Its Reform\u201d (1835)\u2014proved so controversial, each expands upon points made in passing in the Essay on Government. Jurisprudence deals extensively with rights\u2014what they are, by whom they are defined, and how they are best protected. In a similar vein and in a way that anticipates (and arguably influenced) the younger Mill\u2019s On Liberty (1859) Liberty of the Press defends the right of free speech and discussion against arguments in favor of restriction and censorship. Free government requires the free communication of ideas and opinions, and good government requires an informed and critical citizenry. For both, a free press is an indispensable instrument.\nIn the essay on Education Mill describes the conditions most conducive to creating good men and, more particularly, good citizens. Civic or \u201cpolitical education,\u201d he says, is \u201cthe key-stone of the arch; the strength of the whole depends upon it\u201d (Mill 1992, 193). Mill was fond of quoting Helvetius\u2019s dictum l\u2019\u00e9ducation peut tout (\u201ceducation makes everything possible\u201d). And certainly no other political thinker, save perhaps Plato and Thomas Jefferson, set greater store by education than did James Mill. As we discuss in Section 6, by \u201ceducation\u201d Mill meant not only domestic education or formal schooling, but all the influences that go into forming one\u2019s character and outlook, including the influence of social and political instituions.\nIn Prisons and Prison Discipline Mill applies his theory of education to penal reform. Just as one\u2019s character can be well moulded by a good education, so too may one\u2019s character be badly moulded through miseducation. The latter, Mill maintains, is especially evident in the criminal class. Criminals commit crimes and are sent to prison because they have been badly educated. Punishment, properly understood, is a kind of remedial education, and prison, properly structured, presents the opportunity to re-mould inmates\u2019 misshapen characters. Prisons and Prison Discipline delineates the types of punishments likely to deter offenders or, failing that, to re-mould and re-educate criminals to be productive members of society. In these and other respects Mill\u2019s theory of punishment mirrors Plato\u2019s. Like Plato, Mill draws a sharp distinction between punishing someone and harming him. The purpose of punishment is to reform (literally re-form) the soul or character of the inmate so that he may be released into society without fear that he will harm others. But to harm someone is to make him worse, and an even greater danger to society (Ball 1995, ch. 7).\nMill envisaged a society inhabited by active citizens, always on their guard against rulers or representatives who would violate their rights and deprive them of their liberties. This, after all, is the central theme of the Essay on Government, and the thrust of the argument of Mill\u2019s article The Ballot, published in 1830 as a contribution to the public debate preceding the passage of the 1832 Reform Act. Mixing logical acuity with withering ridicule, Mill restates and refutes arguments against extending the franchise and introducing the secret ballot. Only those with sinister interests could oppose such reform.\n6. The Essay on Education\nThe early nineteenth century in Britain was an age increasingly preoccupied with education, especially the public, though not state, provision of education for the lower ranks. Mill\u2019s educational activism in establishing schools for all commenced with his association with Bentham and Place (Burston 1973, ch. 3). For the next two decades, Mill and associates (including William Allen, Edward Wakefield, and Zachary Macaulay \u2013 the father of Mill\u2019s famous critic \u2013 as well as James Mackintosh \u2013 the recipient of Mill\u2019s 1835 harsh criticism) promoted the cause of public education at all levels, from Robert Owen\u2019s infant school to the projected Chrestomathic School in Bentham\u2019s garden and, famously, the University of London \u2013 that \u201cgodless school,\" the \u201cinfidel College in Gower street\u201d (The Standard, 19 June 1828 (issue 340), p. 2). And though Mill kept a low public profile in all these endeavors, \u201cit was always to him that recourse was had, when difficulties came\u201d (Bain 1882, 86).\nMill had put his pen to good use in Edinburgh Review, the Philanthropist and the Eclectic Review throughout the 1810s in the debate over the monitorial systems of Joseph Lancaster (in London endorsed by Mill and associates) and Andrew Bell (backed by the Church of England). However, his Essay on Education (originally published in 1819) bears no mark of that bitter controversy. Not only was Education, like Government, written in a deductive or synthetic style. But also, the abstract, theoretical treatment had important concrete, practical implications for social policy \u2013 implications at which, like Government, Mill only hinted rather than explicitly draw. There are further similarities between Education and Government. For example, even though Mill aimed at a comprehensive view of education, he confined himself \u201cto a skeleton\u201d (Mill 1992, 141). He also began his analysis by defining the subject-matter in connection to the pursuit of happiness. The end of education, he asserted, \u201cis to render the individual, as much as possible, an instrument of happiness, first to himself, and next to other beings\u201d (Mill 1992, 139). What\u2019s more, like Government, Education chose to underplay its Benthamite, radical or utilitarian pedigree. It was quite out of character, for a staunch Benthamite, to point out that wherein happiness \u201cconsists, [is] not yet determined\u201d (Mill 1992, 156), especially since happiness was identified as the end to which education aims.\nEducation, like Government, however, fooled no one where its author\u2019s loyalties lay. Twice Mill contrasted two \u201cclasses of philosophers\u201d: \u201cHartley and his followers in England, Condillac and his followers in France\u201d and \u201cDr Reid and his followers in this country, Kant and the German school of metaphysicians in general on the Continent.\u201d The first disagreement between these two sets of philosophers involved the range of what Mill called \u201csimple feelings.\u201d The first thought impressions and ideas the only simple or original feelings. Though often difficult to analyze a \u201ccomplex feeling\u201d to its constituent simple feelings, for this class of philosophers, perception came in advance of conception. The second class of philosophers did not think impressions and ideas the only \u201coriginal feelings,\u201d incapable of further analysis. They added a third category: \u201cthose [feelings] which correspond to the words remember, believe, judge, space, time, &c.\u201d For Mill, the third category of \u201coriginal feelings\u201d complicated analysis, and, consequently, education by blurring the lines (and order) between perception and conception (Mill 1992, 144). The second disagreement between these two sets of philosophers came up at the attempt to analyze the end of education. The first, Mill claimed, admitted a humble or corporeal origin of happiness, tracing happiness back to simple sensations and their transformation into ideas. For them, combinations of these simple feelings make up all the intellectual and moral phenomena of human nature. The second, Mill argued, go after happiness at a higher plane than \u201cthe grosser elements of sense.\u201d For these philosophers, the mind recognizes truth and right and wrong independently of human experience, \u201cwithout the aid of the senses\u201d (Mill 1992, 157). It was clear that Mill sided with the former philosophical group. However, for his purposes in Education the \u201cdivide\u201d between the a posteriori and a priori schools on this issue mattered little. It was sufficient that his readers assented to the link between happiness and education.\n6.1 Mill on the \u201cHuman Mind\u201d\nThe Essay on Education outlines and anticipates the main themes of Mill\u2019s Analysis, his most comprehensive inquiry into what his son would later call \u201cethology, or the science of character formation\u201d (A System of Logic, Book VI; Ball 2010). Since John Stuart Mill situated his father\u2019s Analysis in the debate between the \u201ca priori view of human knowledge, and of the knowing faculties\u201d and its \u201copposite doctrine\u2014that which derives all knowledge from experience, and all moral and intellectual qualities principally from the direction given to the associations,\u201d let\u2019s for a moment focus on this work. For the younger Mill, much like his own A System of Logic, his father\u2019s Analysis tried to combat a philosophical theory which made \u201cevery inveterate belief and every intense feeling, of which the origin is not remembered, [\u2026] into its own all-sufficient voucher and justification\u201d (J.S. Mill 1873, 233). In 1869, John Stuart Mill published a second edition of this essay with extended comments by himself, Alexander Bain, George Grote and Andrew Findlater, a noted philologist.\nFor James Mill, knowledge comes from sense experience. There are two kinds of sensations, he argued. The first kind is experienced when the object of sense is present. The sources of this kind of experience are the senses and the experience of those sensations which accompany muscle and digestive activity. The second kind is experienced when the object of sense is no longer present. Even after the sensation is gone, some sensory content, a \u201cbare fact,\u201d remains: \u201ca copy, an image, of the sensation, sometimes a representation, or trace, of the sensation,\" i.e. its idea (Mill 1829a, I.40\u201341). \u201c[D]uring the whole of our lives,\u201d James Mill argued, \u201ca series of those two states of consciousness, called sensations, and ideas, is constantly going on.\u201d He highlighted that ideas do not derive from objects but from sensations. And as sensations are either synchronous or successive, \u201c[o]ur ideas spring up, or exist, in the order in which the sensations existed,\u201d in space (simultaneous existence) and/or in time (antecedent and consequent existence) (Mill 1829a, I.52, 55\u201356).\nAssociation Psychology, as thus expounded, examines the links between experience as registered by a conscious mind and the ideas, or trains of ideas, which registered experience springs up. The strength or weakness of associations between a sensation and an idea or between ideas varies, depending on how permanent or vivid they are. Some associations are so firm and constant that they become indissoluble or inseparable, fusing the different aspects of the complex experience into a single cluster of associations. The vividness of a part of the cluster might engross the attention of the conscious mind. Sometimes the cluster is dominated by a sensation, sometimes by an idea. Generally speaking, Mill noted, sensations are more vivid than ideas, the painful or pleasurable sensations or ideas are more vivid than indifferent ones, and the more recent are more vivid than less recent ones (Mill 1829a, I.60\u201363). The perceiving mind attends only to a part of the sense experience, both at the moment of sensation and, consequently, in its copy, image or representation. In History of British India, Mill used this \u201claw\u201d of human nature to explain how a philosophic historian never had to set foot in a foreign country to write its history:\nIn a cursory survey, it is understood, that the mind, unable to attend to the whole of an infinite number of objects, attaches itself to a few; and overlooks the multitude that remain. But what, then, are the objects to which the mind, in such a situation, is in preference attracted? Those which fall in with the current of its own thoughts; those which accord with its former impressions; those which confirm its previous ideas.\nSifting through different testimonies of the same phenomenon, as a judge, one might thus compound a more comprehensive idea of it rather than by being an actual eye witness (Mill 1818, I.xii-xiv; Loizides 2019b).\nFor James Mill, the individual maintains some command over sensations (i.e. in a controlled environment) as they derive from sensible objects. However, one cannot recall ideas or trains of ideas at will, Mill pointed out: \u201cThoughts come into the mind unbidden.\u201d But ideas can be linked with sensible objects, such as sounds, smells, sights, and so on. Language thus provides signs, e.g. audible and visible, which mark sensations and recall ideas (Mill 1829a, I.86\u201389). This way knowledge acquired from the past can be used to guide the future. For example, certain words recall certain ideas and trains of ideas. These ideas or trains of ideas, with or without additional links, might lead to certain behavioral responses, e.g. thoughts, emotions, actions. Analyses of chains of associations identify the links between elicited responses (last step) and actual experience (first step). This is almost impossible to do in cases of indissoluble association, as sensations, ideas and trains of ideas are fused together indiscriminately. Hence, even though most children associate darkness with ghosts, Mill offered an example, \u201c[i]n some this association is soon dissolved,\u201d in others \u201cit continues for life,\u201d especially come the night (Mill 1829a, I.60, 286\u201387). Even a mind like Bentham\u2019s had failed to dissolve such an association.\n6.2 The Formation of Character\nMill\u2019s Education (and Analysis) was criticized for blending together two different projects: epistemology and psychology. The confusion, Wyndham Hedley Burston argued, was due to Mill\u2019s failure to acknowledge the synthetic/analytic or conceptual/empirical distinction (Burston 1973, chs. 5\u20136; Wilson 1990, ch. 4), a critique which was also levelled at his son\u2019s A System of Logic. However, given that epistemology concerns itself, not only with what knowledge is, but also with questions such as how it can be attained and with which cognitive processes do actually allow the attainment of knowledge, James Mill\u2019s enterprise in both Education and Analysis might not appear as suspect as on first glance from a philosophical point of view. Still, Mill\u2019s interest laid indeed primarily in the shaping of the mind, the beliefs, and the behavior of the \u201cknowing subject.\u201d His fundamental doctrine in psychology, his son reported, \u201cwas the formation of all human character by circumstances, through the universal Principle of Association, and the consequent unlimited possibility of improving the moral and intellectual condition of mankind by education\u201d (J.S. Mill 1873, 109, 111). For James Mill, education was all-powerful: \u201cif education does not perform every thing, there is hardly anything which it does not perform\u201d (Mill 1992, 160).\nMill\u2019s argument was straightforward: both individual and social wellbeing depends upon individual action. Actions depend upon one\u2019s feelings and thoughts (the last step in the chain of association prior to action). Education must thus be structured upon the \u201cknowledge of the sequences which take place in the human feelings or thought.\u201d Such knowledge enables the preceptor \u201cto make certain feelings or thoughts take place instead of others\u201d in the student. The kinds of mental succession, upon which education works, Mill urged, make \u201call the difference between the extreme of madness and of wickedness, and the greatest attainable heights of wisdom and virtue\u201d (Mill 1992, 147; Mill 1813a, 98). As one\u2019s bent of mind is revealed in the sequences of its ideas, the object of education is \u201cto provide for the constant production of certain sequences, rather than others,\u201d either through repetition and the inculcation of certain habits, or through association with ideas of pleasure or pain, including those of praise and blame (Mill 1992, 151).\nThe Essay on Education identified two sorts of circumstances that form character: physical and moral. Unlike moral circumstances, not all physical circumstances were amenable to human will. Still, Mill pointed out, the most important of them were: \u201call education is impotent\u201d unless nutrition and labor (and, consequently, health) are of appropriate quality and quantity. He pressed on the point that \u201cnature herself forbids that you shall make a wise and virtuous people, out of a starving\u201d or an over-worked people (Mill 1992, 172\u2013174). Especially as regards the latter, Mill painted a strikingly Platonic picture in 1813, discussing the influence of labor upon factory workers:\nShut up for almost the whole of that period of time which they pass without sleep, with their eyes and all their faculties exclusively fastened day after day upon one and the same narrow circle of objects and operations, their minds are accessible to a smaller number of ideas, and get less of any thing which can be called mental exercise, than any other set of human being, even than the savages in the forest (Mill 1813a, 94).\nThe \u201ceffects of their situation upon their minds are, if possible, still more deplorable\u201d than upon their body, he argued. \"[U]nless care is taken,\" he highlighted in Education, \"by means of the other instruments of education, to counteract\" these dreadful effects of economic progress, the minds \"of the great body of the people are in danger of really degenerating, while the other elements of civilization are advancing\" (Mill 1992, 173).\nAs far as the moral circumstances were concerned, rather than waste time debating final ends, Mill focused on accepted middle principles. The stable production of those mental sequences which fulfil the ends of education, he argued, depends upon cultivating four virtues: intelligence, temperance, justice and generosity. The first two promote individual well-being. Intelligence referred to \"bringing within our ken what is capable, and what is not capable of being used as means,\" but also \"seizing and combining, at the proper moment, whatever is the fittest as means to each particular end.\" More generally, rational practice requires a collection of observations of past acts, with a justified expectation (i.e. that similar causes produce similar effects) for specific results. Temperance entailed the ability of controlling one\u2019s appetites and desires, preventing them from leading to a \"hurtful direction,\" allowing the constant pursuit of what one \"deliberately approves.\" The latter two cardinal virtues, justice and generosity, promote social wellbeing, by avoiding doing harm and by doing positive good to others (i.e. acting supererogatorily) respectively. Of course, Mill insisted, that \"[i]n reality, as the happiness of the individual is bound up with that of his species, that which affects the happiness of the one, must also, in general, affect that of the other (Mill 1992, 154\u2013156, 179; Loizides 2019c).\n6.3 Education, Power and Liberty of the Press\nIn short, Mill thought character depends on \u201cthe direction given to the desires and passions of men.\u201d To this effect, the \u201cbusiness of good education\u201d is to associate the \u201cgrand objects of desire\u201d \u2013 e.g., wealth, power, dignity \u2013 with \u201cadmirable qualities\u201d in individuals (e.g. \u201cgreat intelligence, perfect self-command, and over-ruling benevolence\u201d), not wicked ones (e.g. \u201cflattery, back-biting, treachery\u201d) (Mill 1992, 193; Mill 1829a, II.245). Since the political (and legal) arrangements in a society are very powerful in solidifying such associations through various institutions and practices, \u201cPolitical Education\u201d is \u201cthe key-stone of the arch\u201d (Mill 1992, 193). Not only is government responsible for fostering proper habits and associations with good laws, justice and the eradication of corruption, according to Mill; but also, government should be held accountable when it failed to do so.\nGiven that \u201cour opinions are the fathers of our actions,\u201d Mill argued amidst the debate on parliamentary representation, it is vital that individuals do not take the opinions of others upon trust or let others choose for them what is in their interest to pursue. It was thus quite an important educational task to foster habits of examining the evidence which grounds opinions (Mill 1826, 10\u201311, 13\u201314; Mill 1992, 122, 126\u2013130). Inattention to evidence made the detection of fallacious thinking, lying underneath a host of prejudices, impossible. Especially since those \u201cwho stand on the vantage ground of power,\u201d Mill warned, had made an art of defending power through, what he called, \u201cthe logic of power\u201d: the misrepresentation of facts, suppression of evidence, begging the question, argument from authority, appealing to fear, and inter alia, ridicule (Mill 1824, 465). Due to the ever-present danger that political, legal and social institutions might foster \u201chabits of servility and toleration of arbitrary power,\u201d the \u201cLiberty of the Press\u201d is a vital counteracting social influence, and, for that reason, \u201can inestimable blessing\u201d to good government (Mill 1813b, 211\u2013212, Mill 1992, 117\u2013123; Grint 2017). The press functions thus as a sort of \u201chigh and constant observer\u201d of government acts (Mill 1992, 107) through apt diffusion of praise and blame to public functionaries.\n6.4 Education and Happiness\nJames Mill thought that \u201cof all the circumstances which affect the happiness, the beauty, and order, and well-being of society, by far the most important\u201d is individual character (Mill 1813a, 97). The shaping of character was no simple matter. From the domestic to the political sphere, many institutions played a part in the \u201celevation of the people\u201d: elevation \u201cabove ignorance, above swinishness, above prostitute servility, above oppression, above delusion religious or political, above grovelling vice, above subjection to the irrational passions\u201d (Mill 1813c, 345; Plassart 2008 and 2019). To adapt a famous Stoic idea, as we move from the inner to the outer concentric circles of affection and concern for one's self and for others, it becomes increasingly difficult (impossible even without conducive physical and moral circumstances), to abstain from doing harm or do positive good to others. As we saw, without strong associations, the knowing subject\u2019s mind hardly takes cognizance of the interests or even the existence of others outside the narrow circle of one's self, family, friends and associates.\nThe effects of misguided associations, Mill urged, require \u201cthe greatest attention in Education, and Morals\u201d: the \u201clove of our Fellow-creatures\u201d is \u201ccompletely impotent\u201d against the \u201clove of Wealth, or of Power.\u201d Good education strengthens virtuous motives so that they do not \u201cgive way, habitually, whenever they are opposed by any other motive even of moderate strength\u201d (Mill 1829a, II.241). As he put it:\nWhen the grand sources of felicity are formed into the leading and governing Ideas, each in its due and relative strength, Education has then performed its most perfect work; and thus the individual becomes, to the greatest degree, the source of utility to others, and of happiness to himself (Mill 1829a, II.303).\nOnly when one cares enough to sacrifice that \u201cpart of the self which the good of our species requires\u201d (Mill 1818, V.527) can individual exertion be directed towards the pursuit of social happiness. But it was a pursuit neither for the narrow-minded nor for the faint-hearted. For this reason, Mill thought that no great public good could \u201crest with safety on any thing so precarious, as the chance of extraordinary virtue in particular men\u201d (Mill 1816, 248). \u201cIs it according to the experience of human nature, that men with the powers of government in their hands are angels and have never any propensity to oppress?\u201d, he wondered (Mill 1813d, 464).\n7. Conclusion: Mill\u2019s Legacy\nIn\u00a01822, James Mackintosh found much that was admirable in Mill\u2019s essays on government and education. However, Mackintosh protested, they were founded on an erroneous method (Mackintosh to Napier, 1822). Less than a decade later, Macaulay devastatingly drew out the implications of that method for Mill\u2019s \u201cutilitarian logic and politics.\u201d In\u00a0 reviewing the quarrel between Mill and Macaulay today, the modern reader may well experience a sense of d\u00e9j\u00e0 vu, not because the question of parliamentary reform remains relevant and timely, but because the epistemological and methodological questions raised by this debate are with us still. What is the nature of political knowledge, and how is it to be obtained? What sort of \u201cscience\u201d can \u201cpolitical science\u201d aspire to be? What is the connection between political theory and the practice of politics? Mill\u2019s answers rather resemble those of modern \u201crational choice\u201d theorists, and Macaulay\u2019s those of their empirically minded critics. After all, Mill maintains that any scientific theory worthy of the name must proceed from a finite set of assumptions about human nature, with the self-interest axiom at their center. From these one can deduce conclusions about the ways in which rational political actors will (or at any rate ought to) behave. Macaulay, by contrast, claims that people act for all sorts of reasons, including\u2014but by no means limited to\u2014considerations of self-interest.\nMill\u2019s Essay on Government\u2014and Macaulay\u2019s attack\u2014earned for its author an unenviable reputation as an egregious simplifier of complex matters. Yet Mill remained unrepentant since such simplification was, in his view, the very purpose and point of theorizing. After all, to theorize is to simplify. But, as his critics were quick to note, it is one thing to simplify and quite another to oversimplify. In a modern echo of Macaulay\u2019s estimate, Joseph Schumpeter contrasts Mill\u2019s \u201cmonumental, and indeed path-breaking, History of British India\u201d with the Essay on Government, which \u201ccan be described only as unrelieved nonsense\u201d because of its simplistic assumptions and its equally simplistic conclusions (Schumpeter 1954, 254). A more charitable estimate is provided by Brian Barry. Barry observes:\nThe results [of Mill\u2019s reasoning] may appear somewhat crude, and yet it seems to me a serious question whether James Mill\u2019s political theory is any more of an oversimplification than, say, Ricardo\u2019s economics. The difference is, of course, that Ricardo\u2019s ideas were refined by subsequent theorists, whereas James Mill\u2019s Essay on Government had no successors until the last decade or so (Barry 1970, 11).\nThese successors, on Barry\u2019s telling, include such rational choice theorists as Mancur Olson and Anthony Downs, amongst others. Alan Ryan concurs. Although \u201can eminently dislikable document,\u201d Ryan writes, Mill\u2019s Essay on Government \u201chas virtues that ought not to be neglected.\u201d One of these is that it \u201cstands at the head of a line of thought extending down to Joseph Schumpeter and Anthony Downs, a line of thought that provides many of the explicit or implicit assumptions with the aid of which we still practice political science\u201d (Ryan 1972, 82\u201383).\nAlthough right in one respect, Barry\u2019s and Ryan\u2019s reassessments are rather wide of the mark in another. It is true that there is, methodologically speaking, a family resemblance between Mill\u2019s axiomatic deductive reasoning in Government and, say, Anthony Downs\u2019s An Economic Theory of Democracy (1957). But it is important to note that Mill, unlike Downs and other ostensible successors of the rational choice school, was never content to interpret interests as wants, desires or \u201crevealed preferences.\u201d On the contrary, Mill was concerned with distinguishing between sinister and non-sinister interests, supplying causal explanations of their origins and development, rendering judgments about them, and attempting to alter the conditions that shape (or more often misshape) men\u2019s and women\u2019s characters. Hence his abiding interest in law, education, punishment, penology, psychology, and other avenues of \u201ccharacter-formation.\u201d Mill\u2019s aims were not only explanatory but critical, educative, and, by his lights, emancipatory. The point of almost everything he wrote\u2014from his massive \u201ccritical, or judging\u201d History of British India to the shortest essay\u2014was, to borrow a phrase from Marx, not merely to understand the world but to change it. Not for Mill the vaunted \u201cvalue-neutrality\u201d of modern social and political science.\n",
