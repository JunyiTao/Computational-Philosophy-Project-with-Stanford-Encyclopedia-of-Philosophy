    "main_text": "Harman\u2019s challenge\n3. Harman\u2019s challenge\n\nDespite its venerable pedigree and its intuitive force, the thesis that\nlogic should have a normative role to play in reasoning has not gone\nunchallenged. Gilbert Harman\u2019s criticisms have been particularly\ninfluential. Harman\u2019s skeptical challenge is rooted in a\ndiagnosis: our deep-seated intuition that logic has a special\nnormative connection with reasoning is rooted in a confusion. We have\nconflated two very different kinds of enterprises, viz. that of\nformulating a theory of deductive logic, on the one hand, and what\nHarman calls \u201ca theory of reasoning\u201d (Harman 2002) on the other. Begin\nwith the latter. A theory of reasoning is a normative account about\nhow ordinary agents should go about forming, revising and maintaining\ntheir beliefs. Its aim is to formulate general guidelines as to which\nmental actions (judgments and inferences) to perform in which\ncircumstances and which beliefs to adopt or to abandon (Harman 2009:\n333). As such, the subject matter of a theory of reasoning are the\ndynamic \u201cpsychological events or processes\u201d that\nconstitute reasoning. In contrast, \u201cthe sort of implication and\nargument studied in deductive logic have to do with [static,\nnon-psychological] relations among propositions\u201d (idem). Consequently, \n\n\nlogical principles are not directly rules of belief revision.\nThey are not particularly about belief [or the other mental states and\nacts that constitute reasoning] at all. (Harman 1984: 107) \n\n\nOnce we disabuse ourselves of this confusion, Harman maintains, it is\nhard to see how the resulting gap between logic and reasoning can be\nbridged. This is Harman\u2019s challenge.\n\nAt least two lines of response come to mind. One reaction to\nHarman\u2019s skeptical challenge is to take issue with his way of\nsetting up the problem. In particular, we might reject his explanation of the provenance\nof our intuitions to the effect that logic has a normative role to\nplay in reasoning as stemming from a mistaken identification of\ndeductive logic and theories of reasoning. It might be thought, for\ninstance, that Harman is led to exaggerate the gulf between deductive\nlogic and theories of reasoning as a result of a\ncontestable\u2014because overly narrow\u2014conception of either\nlogic or reasoning, or both. Advocates of broadly logical accounts of\nbelief revision (belief revision theories, non-monotonic logics,\ndynamic doxastic logic, etc.) may feel that Harman is driven to his\nskepticism out of a failure to consider more sophisticated logical\ntools. Unlike standard first-order classical logic, some of these\nformalisms do make explicit mention of beliefs (and possibly other\nmental states). Some formalisms do seek to capture the dynamic\ncharacter of reasoning in which beliefs are not merely accumulated but\nmay also be revised. Harman\u2019s response, it would seem (Harman\n1986: 6), is that such formalisms either tacitly rely on mistaken\nassumptions about the normative role of logic or else fall short of\ntheir objectives in other ways. But even if one disagrees with\nHarman\u2019s assessment, one can still agree that such formal\nmodels of belief revision do not obviate the need for a philosophical\naccount of the normativity of logic. That is because such models do typically tacitly rely on assumptions concerning the normative role of logic. An account of the normativity of logic would thus afford us a fuller\nunderstanding of the presuppositions that undergird such theories.\n\nOn the other hand, some philosophers\u2014externalists of various\nstripes, for instance\u2014may find fault with the epistemological\npresuppositions underlying Harman\u2019s conception of a theory of\nreasoning. Harman views the aim of epistemology as closely linked to\nhis project of providing a theory of reasoning. According to\nHarman\u2019s \u201cgeneral conservatism\u201d, central\nepistemological notions, like that of justification are approached\nfrom the first-personal standpoint: \u201cgeneral conservatism is a\nmethodological principle, offering methodological advice of a sort a\nperson can take\u201d (Harman 2010: 154). As such Harman's approach contrasts with much of\ncontemporary epistemology which, unconcerned with direct epistemic\nadvice, is mainly in the business of seeking to lay down explanatorily\nilluminating necessary and sufficient conditions for epistemic\n justification.[12]\n Summarizing the first line of response, then, Harman's skepticism is partly premised on particular conceptions of logic and of epistemological methodology both of which may be called into question.\n\nThe second line of response is to (largely) accept Harman\u2019s\nassumptions regarding the natures of deductive logic and of epistemology\nbut to try to meet his challenge by showing that there is a\ninteresting normative link between the two after all. In what follows, I focus\nprimarily on this second line of response.\n\nOf course, saying that deductive logic and theories of reasoning are\ndistinct is one thing, affirming that there could not be an\ninteresting normative connection between them is quite another. As a\nfirst stab at articulating such a connection, we might try the\nfollowing simple line of thought: theoretical reasoning aims to\nprovide an accurate representation of the world. We accurately\nrepresent the world by having true (or perhaps knowledgeable) beliefs\nand by avoiding false ones. But our doxastic states have\ncontents\u2014propositions\u2014and these contents stand in certain\nlogical relations to one another. Having an awareness of these logical\nrelations would appear to be conducive to the end of having true\nbeliefs and so is relevant to theoretical reasoning. In particular,\nthe logical notions of consequence and consistency seem to be relevant.\nIf I believe truly, the truth of my belief will carry over to its\nlogical consequences. Conversely, if my belief entails a falsehood it\ncannot be true. Similarly, if the set of propositions I believe (in\ngeneral or in a particular domain) is inconsistent, they cannot\npossibly afford an accurate representation of the world; at least one\nof my beliefs must be false. Harman may be able to agree with all of this. His\nskepticism pertains also (and perhaps primarily) to the question whether logic has a privileged role to play in reasoning; that the principles of logic are relevant to reasoning in a way that principles of other sciences are not (Harman 1986: 20). However, I want to set this further issue to one side for now.\n\nNotice that this simple reflection on the connection between logic and\nnorms of reasoning leads us right back to the basic intuitions at the beginning of this entry: that there is something wrong with us when\nwe hold inconsistent beliefs or when we fail to endorse the logical\nconsequences of our beliefs (at least when we can be expected to be\naware of them). Let us spell these intuitions out by way of the following two principles. Let \\(S\\) be an agent and \\(P\\)\na\n proposition.[13]\n\n\n\n\nLogical implication principle (IMP): If \\(S\\)\u2019s beliefs\nlogically imply \\(A\\), then \\(S\\) ought to believe that\n\\(A\\). \n\n\nLogical consistency principle (CON): \\(S\\) ought to avoid having\nlogically inconsistent beliefs. \n\n\nNotice that on the face of it\n IMP\n and\n CON\n are distinct.\n IMP,\n in and of itself, does not prohibit inconsistent or even\ncontradictory beliefs, all it requires is that my beliefs be closed\nunder logical consequence.\n CON,\n on the other hand, does not require that I believe the consequences\nof the propositions I believe, it merely demands that the set of\npropositions I believe be consistent. However, given certain\nassumptions,\n IMP\n does entail\n CON.\n Against the background of classical logic, the entailment obtains\nprovided we allow the following two assumptions: (i) one cannot (and,\nvia the principle that \u201cought\u201d implies \u201ccan\u201d,\nought not) both believe and disbelieve one and the same\nproposition simultaneously; and (ii) that disbelieving a proposition is\ntantamount to believing its\n negation.[14]\n For let \\(\\{ A_{1}, \\dots, A_{n}\\}\\) be \\(S\\)\u2019s inconsistent\nbelief set. By classical logic, we have \\(A_{1}, \\dots, A_{n-1}\\models\n\\neg A_{n}\\). Since \\(S\\)\u2019s beliefs are closed under logical\nconsequence, \\(S\\) believes \\(\\neg A_{n}\\) and hence, by (ii), disbelieves \\(A_{n}\\). So, \\(S\\) both believes and\ndisbelieves \\(A_{n}\\).\n",
