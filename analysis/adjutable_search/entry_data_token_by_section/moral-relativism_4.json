Are Moral Disagreements Rationally Resolvable?\n\nPhilosophers generally agree that, even if DMR were true\nwithout qualification, it would not directly follow that MMR\nis true. In particular, if moral disagreements could be resolved\nrationally for the most part, then disagreement-based arguments for\nMMR would be undermined, and there would be little incentive\nto endorse the position. Such resolvability, at least in principle, is\nwhat moral objectivism would lead us to expect. One of the main points\nof contention between proponents of MMR and their objectivist\ncritics concerns the possibility of rationally resolving moral\ndisagreements. It might be thought that the defender of MMR\nneeds to show conclusively that the moral disagreements identified in\nDMR cannot be rationally resolved, or again that the moral\nobjectivist must show conclusively that they can be. Neither is a\nreasonable expectation. Indeed, it is unclear what would count as\nconclusively arguing for either conclusion. The center of the debate\nconcerns what plausibly may be expected. Adherents of MMR\nattempt to show why rational resolution is an unlikely prospect, while\ntheir objectivist critics try to show why to a large extent this is\nlikely, or at least not unlikely.\n\nMoral objectivists can allow that there are special cases in which\nmoral disagreements cannot be rationally resolved, for example on\naccount of vagueness or indeterminacy in the concepts involved. Their\nmain claim is that ordinarily there is a rational basis for overcoming\ndisagreements (not that people would actually come to agree).\nObjectivists maintain that, typically, at least one party in a moral\ndisagreement accepts the moral judgment on account of some factual or\nlogical mistake, and that revealing such mistakes would be sufficient\nto rationally resolve the disagreement. They suggest that whatever\ngenuine moral disagreements there are usually can be resolved in this\nfashion. In addition, objectivists sometimes offer an analysis of why\npeople make such mistakes. For example, people may be influenced by\npassion, prejudice, ideology, self-interest, and the like. In general,\nobjectivists think, insofar as people set these influences aside, and\nare reasonable and well-informed, there is generally a basis for\nresolving their moral differences. However, though these claims are\noften made, it is another matter to establish empirically that\nself-interest is the source of disagreement, and it has been argued\nthat there are considerable obstacles to doing this (see Seipel\n2020a). (Objectivists might also say that at least some agreements\nabout moral truths reflect the fact that, with respect to matters\npertaining to these truths, people generally have been reasonable and\nwell-informed.)\n\nProponents of MMR may allow that moral disagreements\nsometimes are rationally resolved. In particular, they may grant that\nthis often happens when the parties to a moral dispute share a moral\nframework. The characteristic relativist contention is that a common\nmoral framework is often lacking, especially in moral disagreements\nbetween one society and another, and that differences in moral\nframeworks usually cannot be explained simply by supposing that one\nsociety or the other is making factual or logical mistakes. These\nmoral disagreements are ultimately rooted in fundamentally different\nmoral orientations, and there is usually no reason to think these\ndifferences result from the fact that, in relevant respects, one side\nis less reasonable or well-informed than the other. They are faultless\ndisagreements. This conclusion might rest on the observation that it\nis not evident that mistakes are at the root of these disagreement.\nBut it might also depend on a theory, developed to explain such\nobservations, that the frameworks are incommensurable: They do not\nhave enough in common, in terms of either shared concepts or shared\nstandards, to resolve their differences, and there is no impartial\nthird standpoint, accessible to any reasonable and well-informed\nperson, that could be invoked to resolve the conflict.\n\nVarious objectivist responses may be made to this argument. One is the\nDavidsonian approach, already considered, that precludes the\npossibility of incommensurable moral frameworks. Another response is\nthat incommensurability does not preclude the possibility of\nrationally resolving differences between moral frameworks. For\nexample, Alasdair MacIntyre (1988: ch. 18 and 1994) has argued that,\nin some circumstances, it is possible to realize, through an exercise\nin imagination, that a conflicting and incommensurable moral tradition\nis rationally superior to one\u2019s own tradition. However, the most\ncommon objectivist response is to claim that some specific moral\nframework is rationally superior to all others. For example, it might\nbe argued, following Kant, that pure practical reason implies a\nfundamental moral principle such as the Categorical Imperative (see\n Kant\u2019s moral philosophy),\n or it might be claimed, following Aristotle, that human nature is\nsuch that virtues such as courage, temperance, and justice are\nnecessary for any plausible conception of a good life (see the\nsections on\n the human good and the function argument\n in the entry on Aristotle\u2019s ethics, and the entry on\n virtue ethics).\n If such an argument were sound, it might provide a compelling\nresponse to the relativist contention that conflicts between moral\nframeworks cannot be rationally resolved.\n\nProponents of MMR are unimpressed by these responses. They\nmay say that the Davidsonian account cannot assure sufficient common\nground to resolve conflicts between moral frameworks (or to ensure\nthat there is really only one framework), and that MacIntyre\u2019s\napproach is likely to work at best only in some cases. And they\nusually consider debates about the Kantian and Aristotelian arguments\nto be as difficult to resolve rationally as the conflicts between\nmoral frameworks the relativists originally invoked. They may add that\nthe fact that moral objectivists disagree among themselves about which\nobjectivist theory is correct is further indication of the difficulty\nof resolving fundamental moral conflicts.\n\nA rather different objectivist challenge is that the position of the\nproponent of MMR is inconsistent. The relativist argument is\nthat we should reject moral objectivism because there is little\nprospect of rationally resolving fundamental moral disagreements.\nHowever, it may be pointed out, the relativist should acknowledge that\nthere is no more prospect of rationally resolving disagreements about\nMMR. By parity of reasoning, he or she should grant that\nthere is no objective truth concerning MMR.\n\nTo this familiar kind of objection, there are two equally familiar\nresponses. One is to concede the objection and maintain that\nMMR is true and justified in some metaethical frameworks, but\nnot others: It is not an objective truth that any reasonable and\nwell-informed person has reason to accept. This may seem to concede a\ngreat deal, but for someone who is a relativist through and through,\nor at least is a relativist about metaethical claims, this would be\nthe only option. The other response is to contest the claim that there\nis parity of reasoning in the two cases. This would require showing\nthat the dispute about the irresolvability of moral disagreements (a\nmetaethical debate) can be rationally resolved in a way that\nfundamental moral disagreements (substantive normative debates)\nthemselves cannot. For example, the metaethical debate might be\nrationally resolved in favor of the relativist, while the substantive\nnormative debates cannot be resolved.\n",
