Recall\u00a0the vessel with a\npartition wall that we have encountered in\n Section 1,\n but vary the setup slightly: rather than having one side empty, the\ntwo sides of the vessel are filled with gases of different\ntemperatures. Additionally, there is now a shutter in the wall which\nis operated by a demon. The demon carefully observes all the\nmolecules. Whenever a particle in the cooler side moves towards the\nshutter the demon checks its velocity, and if the velocity of the\nparticle is greater than the mean velocity of the particles on the\nhotter side of the vessel he opens the shutter and lets the particle\npass through to the hotter side. The net effect of the demon\u2019s\nactions is that the hotter gas becomes even hotter and that the colder\ngas becomes even colder. This means that there is a heat transfer from\nthe cooler to the hotter gas without doing any work because the heat\ntransfer is solely due to the demon\u2019s skill and intelligence in\nsorting the molecules. Yet, according to the Second Law of\nthermodynamics, this sort of heat transfer is not allowed. So we\narrive at the conclusion that the demons\u2019 action result in a\nviolation of the Second Law of thermodynamics.\n\nMaxwell interpreted this scenario as a thought experiment that showed\nthat the Second Law of thermodynamics is not an exceptionless law and\nthat it has only \u201cstatistical certainty\u201d (see Knott 1911;\nHemmo & Shenker 2010). Maxwell\u2019s demon has given rise to a\nvast literature, some of it in prestigious physics journals. Much of\nthis literature has focused on exorcising the demon, i.e., on showing\nthat a demon would not be physically possible. Broadly speaking, there\nare two approaches. The first approach is commonly attributed to\nSzilard (1929 [1990]), but also goes also back to von Neumann (1932\n[1955]) and Brillouin (1951 [1990]). The core idea of this approach is\nthat gaining information that allows us to distinguish between \\(n\\)\nequally likely states comes at a necessary minimum cost in\nthermodynamic entropy of \\(k \\log(n)\\), which is the entropy\ndissipated by the system that gains information. Since the demon has\nto gain information to decide whether to open the shutter, the second\nlaw of thermodynamics is not violated. The second approach is based on\nwhat is now called Landauer\u2019s principle, which states\nthat in erasing information that can discern between \\(n\\) states, a\nminimum thermodynamic entropy of \\(k \\log(n)\\) is dissipated (Landauer\n1961 [1990]). Proponents of the principle argue that because a demon\nhas to erase information on memory devices, Landauer\u2019s principle\nprohibits a violation of the second law of thermodynamics.\n\nIn two influential articles Earman and Norton (1998, 1999) lament that\nfrom the point of view of philosophy of science the literature on\nexorcising the demon lacks rigour and reflection on what the goals the\nenterprise are, and that the demon has been discussed from various\ndifferent perspectives, often leading to confusion. Earman and Norton\nargue that the appeal to information theory has not resulted in a\ndecisive exorcism of Maxwell\u2019s demon. They pose a dilemma for\nthe proponent of an information theoretic exorcism of Maxwell\u2019s\ndemon. Either the combined system of the vessel and the demon are\nalready assumed to be subject to the second law of thermodynamics, in\nwhich case it is trivial that the demon will fail. Or, if this is not\nassumed, then proponents of the information theoretic exorcism have to\nsupply new physical principles to guarantee the failure of the demon\nand they have to give independent grounds for it. Yet, in Earman and\nNorton\u2019s view, such independent grounds have not been\nconvincingly established.\n\nBub (2001) and Bennett (2003) responded to Earman and Norton that if\none assumes that the demon is subject to the Second Law of\nthermodynamics, the merit of Landauer\u2019s principle is that it\nshows where the thermodynamic costs arise. Norton (2005, 2017) replies\nthat no general precise principle is stated how erasure and the\nmerging of computational paths necessarily lead to an increase in\nthermodynamic entropy. He concludes that the literature on\nLandauer\u2019s principle is too fragile and too tied to a few\nspecific examples to sustain general claims about the failure of\nMaxwell\u2019s demons. Maroney (2005) argues that thermodynamic\nentropy and information-theoretic entropy are conceptually different,\nand that two widespread generalisations of Landauer\u2019s\nfail. Maroney (2009) then formulates what he regards as a more precise\ngeneralisation of Landauer\u2019s principle, which he argues does not\nfail.\n\nThe discussions around Maxwell\u2019s demon are now so extensive that\nthey defy documentation in an introductory survey of SM. Classical\npapers on the matter are collected in Leff and Rex (1990). For more\nrecent discussion see, for instance, Anta (2021b), Hemmo and Shenker\n(2012; 2019), Ladyman and Robertson (2013, 2014), Leff and Rex (1994),\nMyrvold (forthcoming), Norton (2013), and references therein.\n",
