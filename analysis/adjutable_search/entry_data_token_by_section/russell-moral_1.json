The Open Question Argument versus the Barren Tautology Argument\n\n\u201cI certainly have been more influenced by [Russell] than any\nother single philosopher\u201d wrote Moore in his intellectual\nautobiography (Schilpp (ed.) 1942: 16). But Moore\u2019s\n\u201cAutobiography\u201d suggests (without actually saying so) that\nthis influence was mostly metaphysical. I shall argue that Russell had\na considerable influence on Moore\u2019s ethical doctrines and\nthat some of Moore\u2019s key ideas were developed in the course of ongoing\ndebates with Russell.\n\nMoore\u2019s Principia Ethica took a long time to finish. He had a\npretty good draft in 1898, but he did not publish it until 1903. Why\nthe long delay? One reason, I suspect, was that he had to deal with a\nproblem posed (perhaps unwittingly) by Russell.\n\nIt is not generally recognized that Principia Ethica contains\ntwo distinct arguments against the \u201cNaturalistic\nFallacy\u201d, the supposed intellectual error of identifying\ngoodness with some other property (usually, though not necessarily, a\nnaturalistic property). The first, which is derived from\nSidgwick, and has a long philosophical pedigree, goes something like\nthis:\n\n(1.1)\nFor any naturalistic or metaphysical \u201cX\u201d, if\n\u201cgood\u201d meant \u201cX\u201d, then (i)\n\u201cX things are good\u201d would be a barren tautology,\nequivalent to (ii) \u201cX things are X\u201d or (iii)\n\u201cGood things are good\u201d.\n(1.2)\nFor any naturalistic or metaphysical \u201cX\u201d, if\n(i) \u201cX things are good\u201d were a barren tautology, it\nwould not provide a reason for action (i.e., a reason to promote\nX-ness).\n(1.3)\nSo for any naturalistic or metaphysical \u201cX\u201d,\neither (i) \u201cX things are good\u201d does\nnot provide a reason for action (i.e., a reason to promote\nX-ness), or \u201cgood\u201d does not mean\n\u201cX\u201d.\n\n\nTo put the point another way:\n\n(1.3\u2032)\nFor any naturalistic or metaphysical \u201cX\u201d,\nif (i) \u201cX things are good\u201d provides a\nreason for action (that is, a reason to promote X-ness),\nthen \u201cgood\u201d does not mean\n\u201cX\u201d.\n\n\nFollowing Russell, I call this the Barren Tautology Argument\nor BTA (RoE: 100/Papers 4: 572). The idea is that\n\u201cgood\u201d cannot be synonymous with any naturalistic\n\u201cX\u201d, if \u201cX things are good\u201d is\nsupposed to be a reason for action rather than a \u201cbarren\ntautology\u201d. So for example, if \u201cgood\u201d just\nmeans \u201cpleasant\u201d then \u201cPleasant things are\ngood\u201d is a barren tautology (equivalent to \u201cPleasant\nthings are pleasant\u201d or \u201cGood things are good\u201d) and\ncannot provide us with a reason for the pursuit of pleasure. Only if\n\u201cgoodness\u201d and \u201cpleasure\u201d are not\nsynonymous, can \u201cPleasant things are good\u201d provide an\nintellectual incentive for the pursuit of pleasant things. This\nargument crops up at PE: \u00a711 (though variants of it\nrecur throughout the first four chapters (PE: \u00a7\u00a714,\n24 & 26):\n\n\nWhen A says \u201cGood means pleasant\u201d and B says\n\u201cGood means desired,\u201d they may merely wish to assert that\nmost people have used the word for what is pleasant and for what is\ndesired respectively. [But I do not think] that any exponent of\nnaturalistic Ethics would be willing to allow that this was all he\nmeant. They are all so anxious to persuade us that what they call the\ngood is what we really ought to do. \u201cDo, pray, act so, because\nthe word \u2018good\u2019 is generally used to denote actions of\nthis nature\u201d: such, on this view, would be the substance of\ntheir teaching \u2026 But how perfectly absurd is the reason they\nwould give for it! \u201cYou are to do this, because most people use\na certain word to denote conduct such as this.\u201d \u201cYou are\nto say the thing which is not, because most people call it\nlying.\u201d That is an argument just as good! \u2026. When they\nsay \u201cPleasure is good,\u201d we cannot believe that they merely\nmean \u201cPleasure is pleasure\u201d and nothing more than\nthat.\n\n\nHowever Moore did not invent this argument. A.N. Prior, in his\nLogic and the Basis of Ethics (1949: ch. IX), traces it back\nto Cudworth in the 17th Century, though it doubtful whether\nMoore was aware of this. (He does not seem to have been particularly\nwell read.) But it certainly occurs in Sidgwick, which is presumably\nwhere Moore got it from. The Barren Tautology Argument is to be\ndistinguished from the Open Question Argument proper (the OQA), which\nMoore did invent, at least in its modern form. This occurs at\nPE: \u00a713, a section that does not appear in the 1898\ndraft. It can be stated thus:\n\n(1.4)\n\u201cAre X things good?\u201d is a significant or open\nquestion for any naturalistic or metaphysical predicate\n\u201cX\u201d (whether simple or complex). [A question is\nsignificant or open if an understanding of the language does not\nsuffice for an answer. Thus \u201cAre bachelors unmarried?\u201d is\nnot an Open Question.]\n(1.5)\nIf two expressions (whether simple or complex) are synonymous this\nis evident on reflection to every competent speaker.\n(1.6)\nThe meaning of a predicate or property word is the property for\nwhich it stands. Thus if two predicates or property words have\ndistinct meanings, they name distinct properties.\n\n\nFrom (1.4) and (1.5) it follows that\n\n(1.7)\n\u201cGood\u201d is not synonymous with any naturalistic or\nmetaphysical predicate \u201cX\u201d (or\n\u201cgoodness\u201d with any corresponding noun or noun-phrase\n\u201cX-ness\u201d).\n\n\nIf \u201cgood\u201d were synonymous with some naturalistic\npredicate \u201cX\u201d, then this would be obvious on\nreflection to every competent speaker. Hence there would be\nsome question of the form \u201cAre X things\ngood?\u201d which would not appear to be open to competent\nspeakers, since an understanding of the words involved would suffice\nfor an affirmative answer. Given (1.4), there is no such question;\nhence \u201cgood\u201d is not synonymous with any naturalistic\npredicate \u201cX\u201d.\n\nFrom (1.6) and (1.7) it follows that\n\n(1.8)\nGoodness is not identical with any natural or metaphysical\nproperty of X-ness.\n\n\nThis argument is wheeled on to discredit a particular naturalistic\nanalysis of \u201cgood\u201d\u2014\u201cone of the more plausible,\nbecause one of the more complicated of such\ndefinitions\u201d\u2014that \u201c good mean[s] \u2026 that which\nwe desire to desire\u201d. Where did Moore get this definition? He\ndoes not say, crediting it, in effect, to Mr Nobody. But in fact the\ninventor of this plausible but fallacious definition was none other\nthan the Hon. Bertrand Russell.\n2.2. Wrestling With Desire: the Young Russell\u2019s Adventures in Meta-Ethics\n\nThe desire-to-desire theory is the last in a sequence of three\nattempts to provide a foundation for ethics by defining\n\u201cgood\u201d in terms of desire. In the first, \u201cX\nis good\u201d means \u201cX will satisfy my desires\u201d;\nin the second, it means \u201cI want X for its own\nsake\u201d; and in the third it means \u201cX is what I\ndesire to desire\u201d (RoE: chs. 7, 9 &\n10/Papers 1: nos. 36, 39 & 15).\n\n\u201cEthical Axioms\u201d (1894) was the last piece that Russell\nwrote for Sidgwick\u2019s course on ethics (RoE:\n53\u201356/Papers 1: 226\u2013228). Russell takes it as a\ndatum that \u201cwe do make moral judgments\u201d and that \u201cwe\nregard these, like judgments as to what is, as liable to truth and\nfalsehood\u201d. We are \u201cprecluded from skepticism\u201d\n(presumably the view that moral judgments are all false) \u201cby the\nmere fact we will and act\u201d. (This is not a very convincing\nargument since I can desire something\u2014and hence\nact\u2014without thinking it good, as non-human animals presumably\ndo. The precondition of action is desire, not desire tricked\nout in the vocabulary of good and evil.) Hence \u201csome basis must\nbe found for ethical judgments\u201d, but \u201cit is sufficiently\nobvious that such a basis cannot be sought in any proposition about\nwhat is or has been\u201d. Thus Russell has set himself a rather\ndifficult problem, since it is not at all clear that there\ncan be any true propositions that are not, in some sense,\npropositions about what is, has been or will be. Perhaps what he has\nin mind is a set of self-evident axioms about what ought to be or what\nwe ought to do which do not admit of any further analysis. But he\nrejects this option because \u201cthe Kantian maxim\u201d (whatever\nthat is) is purely formal and because no \u201cmaterial\nprecept\u201d \u201chas obtained the universal consent of\nmoralists\u201d. (It seems that a maxim cannot count as self-evident\nunless it is evident to every qualified self.) Russell also rejects\nthe view that moral judgments are \u201cmerely statements of a\npsychological state\u201d (as, for example, that the speaker desires\nthis or that) on the grounds that in that case \u201cthey could not\nerr (except by the speaker\u2019s mistaking his own feelings)\u201d. He\nseems to think that it is a conceptual truth that moral judgments are\nliable to error. Finally he plumps for the view that \u201cwe may\ndefine the good as that which satisfies desire\u201d (that is, that\nwhat is good for each person is what will satisfy that person\u2019s\ndesires). This allows for the possibility of error, for though we\nusually know what we want, we can be wrong about whether we will like\nit when we get it. Russell hastens to explain that this definition is\nnot as sordid as it sounds. \u201cOur duty will consist in\nself-realization, but self-realization may of course be best attained\nby what is commonly called self-sacrifice.\u201d\n\nIt is nice to know that no sordid or selfish consequences flow from\ndefining the goodness in terms of the satisfaction of desire, but it\nis not at all clear that Russell has solved the problem that he had\nset himself. For propositions about what will satisfy desire are\npropositions about what will satisfy desire\u2014that is,\npropositions about what will be. Underlying Russell\u2019s\nargument is his evident desire to forge a conceptual connection\nbetween moral belief and action. The theory must (help) explain the\nfact that we often do what we believe to be our duty and\nusually pursue and promote what we believe to be good. This,\nnot the thesis that we are necessarily motivated by our moral\nbeliefs, is the premise of Hume\u2019s famous Motivation Argument at\nTreatise, 3.1.1:\n\n\nAnd this is confirmed by common experience, which informs us that men\nare often governed by their duties, and are deterred from\nsome actions by the opinion of injustice, and impelled to\nothers by that of obligation [my italics].\n\n\n(See D.D. Raphael (ed.) 1991 The British Moralists\n[henceforward BM: \u00a7489].) Russell appears to have\nthought that a theory that left \u201cgood\u201d and\n\u201cought\u201d undefined would not meet this constraint. But if\n\u201cgood\u201d means what procures satisfaction, then we\nhave the beginnings of such an explanation. For we usually desire that\nour desires be satisfied, and hence we have a reason to pursue and\npromote the good.\n\nThis theory soon ceased to satisfy, and Russell reverted to the\nproblem in \u201cAre All Desires Equally Moral?\u201d, a paper he\ncomposed in about 1896 (RoE: 68\u201370/Papers 1:\n242\u201344). \u201cThe Good, for me, at any moment\u201d, he\ndeclares, \u201cis what I want\u201d not what will satisfy my wants,\nsince we desire the objects that will satisfy desire and not,\n\u201cexcept derivatively\u201d, that those desires should be\nsatisfied. (This last point is distinctly dubious. Isn\u2019t Reid\u2019s desire\nfor our good-on-the-whole in part a second order desire that at least\nsome of our first-order desires should be satisfied? [See\nThomas Reid, 1788, Essays on the Active Powers of Man,\nexcerpted in BM: \u00a7\u00a7 861\u2013865.] And did not\nRussell himself believe that this desire was not only real but often\nunduly predominant in civilized persons, so much so that most of what\nwe do is done for the sake of something else not because we have a\nspontaneous, first-order desire to do it? See for instance his 1894\npaper \u201cCleopatra or Maggie Tulliver\u201d [RoE:\n57\u201367, Papers 1: 92\u201398] though the theme is\nrepeated in subsequent writings such as The Principles of Social\nReconstruction, first published in 1916.) Thus \u201cX is\ngood\u201d, means \u201cI want X\u201d, a particularly crude\nkind of subjectivism that goes back to Hobbes (\u201cwhatsoever is\nthe object of any man\u2019s appetite or desire; that is it which he for\nhis part calleth good\u201d, BM: \u00a725). This\ntheory maintains the link between moral belief and action (naturally\nwe pursue and promote the things that we want!) though it a) reduces\nmoral judgments to \u201cstatements of a psychological state\u201d\nand b) violates the requirement that statements about what ought to be\nshould have nothing to do with what is, since, on this theory, my\nmoral judgments reduce to statements about what is going on\ninside my head. The theory as stated is a little too crude\nfor Russell however, since it precludes the possibility of moral\nerror. After all, it is difficult to be wrong about what we want. The\ntheory has the further unhappy consequence that we cannot desire what\nwe believe to be bad, let alone what is bad, since from the\nvery fact that I desire something, it follows that for me, at least,\nit is good. All desires are equally moral since they are all desires\nfor the good.\n\nRussell tries to sidestep these problems by distinguishing between\n\u201cprimary desires, for ends, and secondary\ndesires, for means\u201d. The good for each person is what he desires\nfor its own sake and generally speaking he cannot be mistaken about\nthis. But he can be mistaken about whether a given\nobject is the means to what he ultimately desires.\nFurthermore, if he is mistaken, his secondary desires may be\nimmoral. As Russell realizes, this leads to the \u201cSocratic maxim\nthat no man sins wittingly\u201d since nobody can desire what he\nbelieves to be bad. But an agent can both desire the bad and have bad\ndesires, since his secondary desires may be inimical to his ultimate\nends. Unfortunately this amendment cannot save the theory. According\nto Russell\u2019s theory, in some cases at any rate\n\u201cX is good\u201d, means \u201cI want X for its\nown sake\u201d, and such judgments are relatively immune from error.\nFurthermore, people do seem to desire what they believe to be bad (the\n\u201cSocratic maxim\u201d is not known as the \u201cSocratic\nParadox\u201d for nothing!) and we commonly think that desires for\nends, as well as desires for means, can be bad. Finally, the theory,\neven in its amended form, reduces moral judgments to statements of a\npsychological state. Thus the theory violates Russell\u2019s theoretical\nconstraints and is inconsistent with the way we usually talk.\n\nWhat about the desire-to-desire theory? If \u201cX is\ngood\u201d means \u201cI desire to desire X\u201d then there\nis a conceptual connection, though, as Lewis notes, an\n\u201ciffy\u201d one, between moral belief and action (Lewis 1989:\n116/72). I will pursue and promote what I believe to be good in so far\nas I desire what I desire to desire. Moral judgments \u201clike\njudgments as to what is, [are] liable to truth and falsehood\u201d,\nthough not very liable to falsehood, since it is difficult,\nbut not impossible, to be mistaken about what we desire to desire. (I\nmight be persuaded, especially under moral pressure, that I desire to\ndesire something when in fact I do not.) But it is possible both to\ndesire the bad (to desire what I desire not to desire) and to\nhave bad desires (to have desires which I desire to desire not to\ndesire). Self-conscious depravity is thus a real possibility and the\nSocratic paradox is dismissed. For like an unhappy junkie, I can act\non desires which I desire not to desire. But it is not possible to\ndesire to desire the bad since what we desire to desire is\nautomatically good. Furthermore, moral judgments are reduced to\nstatements of a psychological state, so much so that ethics becomes a\nbranch of empirical psychology. The axioms of ethics, in so far as\nthere are such things, are concerned with what is, since our desires,\nincluding our second-order desires are original existents.\n\nThus Russell was trying in the 1890s to devise a theory that would\nmeet six constraints:\n\n(2.1)\nMoral judgments, \u201clike judgments as to what is\u201d, must\nhave a truth-value.\n(2.2)\nMoral judgments must be liable to error (two constraints that\nRussell tends to confuse).\n(2.3)\nThere must be a conceptual connection (possibly an iffy one)\nbetween moral belief and motivation [a rather weak form of\nmotivational internalism].\n(2.4)\nIt must be possible to desire the bad and to have bad\ndesires.\n(2.5)\nMoral judgments must not reduce to \u201cstatements of a\npsychological state\u201d.\n(2.6)\nThe basis for moral judgments cannot be sought in any proposition\nabout what is, has been or will be.\n\n\nThe last condition, which amounts to the denial of naturalism, goes\nback to a paper that Russell wrote for Sidgwick in 1893, \u201cThe\nRelation of What Ought to be to What Is, Has Been or Will Be\u201d\n(RoE: 37\u201340/Papers 1: 213\u2013214). Russell\nobserves that \u201cfrom the point of view of formal logic\u201d it\nis impossible to derive an Ought from an Is. This leads him to the\nconclusion that \u201csome one or more propositions ethical in form\nmust be regarded as axiomatic unless [and this is a big\n\u2018unless\u2019] such propositions are materially equivalent to\nsome assertion about what is, has been or will be\u201d. By\n\u201cmaterially equivalent\u201d he seems to mean \u201cmean the\nsame as\u201d. Thus morality might not hang from the skyhook of\nintuited axioms if moral judgments meant the same as natural judgments\nof some kind. But he goes on to argue against this possibility, that\nis, to argue that what Moore was to call naturalism is false.\nNor is it odd that he should have anticipated Moore, since Sidgwick,\nwho was their teacher, anticipated them both.\n\nHowever this provides Russell with a sextet of constraints that cannot\nbe jointly met. For example, it is hard to see how conditions (2.1)\nand (2.3) can be realized without analyzing \u201cgood\u201d or\n\u201cought\u201d in terms of desire or some such psychological\nstate. Yet to do so violates conditions (2.5) and (2.6). Thus it comes\nas no surprise that the theories which Russell managed to come up with\nall fail to meet his constraints. The first (\u201cX is\ngood\u201d means \u201cX will satisfy my desires\u201d)\nmeets conditions (2.1) (since what we want may not satisfy us once we\nget it). It also meets condition (2.4) (just about) since it is\npossible to want things that will not, in fact, satisfy us. But it\ndoesn\u2019t meet (2.5), since \u201cX is good\u201d reduces to a\nstatement about a future psychological state; and a\nfortiori it fails to meet condition (2.6). The second theory\n(\u201cX is good\u201d means \u201cI want X for its\nown sake\u201d) fares far worse. It meets condition (2.1) but not\n(2.2), (2.3) but not (2.4), and fails (2.5) and (2.6) altogether. As\nfor the third (\u201cX is good\u201d means \u201cX is\nwhat I desire to desire\u201d), it meets (2.1), struggles to meet\n(2.2), meets (2.3) and (2.4) but fails both (2.5) and (2.6).\n\nInterestingly if Russell abandoned (2.1) and (2.2) and adopted a\nnon-cognitive theory he would have been able to arrive at a theory\nwhich would have satisfied the last four constraints. Take Russell\u2019s\nown brand of emotivism (\u201cX is good\u201d means\n\u201cWould that everyone desired X!\u201d), which he did not\ndevelop until 1935 (RoE: 131\u2013144/Religion and\nScience, ch. IX). This meets condition (2.3), since if I say that\nX is good, and if am sincere in my ethical pronouncements, then\nI desire that everyone (including myself) should desire\nX\u2014a second order desire that is usually (but not always)\naccompanied by a first-order desire for X itself. Thus if I\n\u201cbelieve\u201d (note the scare quotes!) that X is good,\nI am likely to pursue or promote it. The theory meets condition (2.4)\ntoo, since I can desire things, from chocolate to crack, that I desire\nnobody (including myself) to desire. It meets condition (2.5) as well,\nsince good-judgments, so far from being statements of a psychological\nstate, are not statements at all but optatives. For much the same\nreason it meets condition (2.6): \u201cX is good\u201d, is\nnot equivalent to a proposition about what is, has been or will be,\nbecause it is not equivalent to any proposition whatsoever. But of\ncourse the standard objection to non-cognitivist theories is precisely\nthat they violate conditions (2.1) and (2.2). They treat utterances\nwhich are commonly regarded as true or false as lacking in truth-value\n(at least with respect to their primary meanings) and they immunize\nmoral judgments from error by depriving them of the possibility of\nfalsehood.\n\nNow I don\u2019t say that Russell\u2019s six constraints are correct (they can\u2019t\nbe since they are inconsistent), nor that Russell\u2019s meta-ethical\ntheories are right (which at most one of them can be since they, too,\nare inconsistent). But I do say that the constraints are\nplausible and that it is a desideratum in a meta-ethical\ntheory that it meet as many as possible. Russell demonstrates his\nphilosophical acumen by making the attempt.\n\nIn 1897, Russell decided in effect, to sacrifice conditions (2.5)\n(2.6), and perhaps (2.2) to conditions (2.1), (2.3) and (2.4). In that\nyear he read a paper to the Cambridge Apostles \u201cIs Ethics a\nBranch of Empirical Psychology\u201d in which he defined goodness as\nthat which we desire to desire. (RoE:\n71\u201378/Papers I: 100\u2013104). Moral judgments (at\nleast judgments about goodness) reduce to \u201cstatements of a\npsychological state\u201d since to say something is good is to say\nthat \u201cwe\u201d desire to desire it, a statement well within the\nfrontiers of psychology (whether \u201cwe\u201d refers to the\ncommunity at large or to the speaker whoever he or she may be). And of\ncourse, if judgments about goodness reduce to \u201cstatements of a\npsychological state\u201d, they clearly reduce to statements about\n\u201cwhat is, has been or will be\u201d, since whether\n\u201cwe\u201d desire to desire something is determined by whatever\nis the case in \u201cour\u201d minds. Are moral judgments\nliable to error? Only in so far as we can be mistaken about what we\ndesire to desire, which is, perhaps, not very far. On the plus side,\nmoral judgments will be true or false, and will have a conceptual\nconnection (albeit an iffy one) to our actions and passions. Assuming\nthat (at least sometimes) I actually desire what I desire to desire,\nthe fact that (for me) X is good means that (at least\nsometimes) I will have a desire to pursue or promote X.\nFinally, it is perfectly possible to have bad or even evil desires,\nnamely the desires I desire not to desire, thus solving a\nproblem with Russell\u2019s previous attempts at a desire-based ethic (see\nRoE: ch. 9/Papers I: ch. 39). Thus the answer\nRussell provides to his own question (\u201cIs Ethics a Branch of\nEmpirical Psychology?\u201d) is a clear, but reluctant,\nyes.\n2.3. Why the Open Question Argument?\n\nNow why should this theory pose a problem for Moore? Because the\ntime-honored Barren Tautology argument does not work against it.\nRemember, the conclusion of the Barren Tautology Argument is this:\n\n(1.3\u2032)\nFor any naturalistic or metaphysical \u201cX\u201d,\nif (i) \u201cX things are good\u201d, provides a\nreason for action (that is, a reason to promote X-ness),\nthen \u201cgood\u201d does not mean\n\u201cX\u201d.\n\n\nBy substitution this gives us:\n\n(1.3\u2033)\nIf (i\u2032) \u201cThings which we desire to desire are\ngood\u201d, provides a reason for action (that is, a reason to\npromote what we desire to desire), then \u201cgood\u201d\ndoes not mean \u201cwhat we desire to desire\u201d.\n\n\nBut the point of defining goodness in terms of what we desire to\ndesire is not to give us a reason to pursue or promote what\nwe desire to desire\u2014rather, it is supposed to explain\nwhy something\u2019s being good gives us a reason (or at least, a\nmotive), to pursue or promote it. Russell is not advocating\nthe pursuit of what we desire to desire: he is trying to provide an\nanalysis of \u201cgood\u201d which helps to make sense of the fact\nthat we tend to pursue and promote (what we believe to be) good\nthings. (We do it because to be good just is to be something\nwhich we desire to desire, and hence something which, sometimes at any\nrate, we will actually desire.) In other words, (i\u2032)\n\u201cThings which we desire to desire are good\u201d is\nmeant to be a barren tautology\u2014barren in terms of\npractical consequences, that is, though, hopefully, philosophically\nilluminating. It does not provide (and is not intended to\nprovide) a reason for action. But in that case, the antecedent of\n(1.3\u2033)\u2014that the belief that \u201cThings which we desire\nto desire are good\u201d, provides a reason for action\u2014is\nfalse, so far as Russell\u2019s analysis is concerned. Thus even if the\nconditional (1.3\u2033) is true, it does not support the\nconsequent\u2014that \u201cgood\u201d does not mean \u201cwhat we\ndesire to desire\u201d. The Barren Tautology Argument is therefore\nimpotent against the desire-to-desire theory.\n\nNor is this all. The Barren Tautology Argument fails against other\ntheories whose aim is to explicate the appeal of goodness rather than\nto advocate the pursuit of some alleged good thing. For instance, if\n\u201cgood\u201d means \u201cwhat we are ideally inclined to\napprove of\u201d, then \u201cWhat we are ideally inclined to approve\nof is good\u201d will be a barren tautology. But since people like\nHume, who propound such definitions, don\u2019t intend them to be anything\nelse, they are not compelled to the conclusion that such definitions\nare false. Thus if naturalism was to be defeated (which was\nclearly Moore\u2019s project) a new argument had to be invented.\nAnd it is significant, I think, that Moore did not publish\nPrincipia Ethica until he had invented just such an\nargument.\n\nThe Open Question Argument proper does not terminate in a conditional\nbut a categorical. It starts with the assumption that \u201cAre\nX things good?\u201d is a significant or open question for any\nnaturalistic or metaphysical predicate \u201cX\u201d. It is\nnot a tautology, barren or otherwise, that what we desire to\ndesire is good, and the proof of this is that competent speakers\ncan sensibly wonder whether or not it is true. Indeed, according to\nMoore, \u201cany one can easily convince himself by inspection\u201d\nthat the predicate \u201cgood\u201d \u201cis positively different\nfrom the notion of \u2018desiring to desire\u2019\u201d. If we\ngrant Moore\u2019s first implicit assumption\u2014that if two expressions\nare synonymous this is evident on reflection to every competent\nspeaker\u2014we can derive the consequence that \u201cgood\u201d\ndoes not mean \u201cwhat we desire to desire\u201d. And if\nwe grant his second implicit assumption\u2014that if two predicates\nor property words have distinct meanings they name distinct\nproperties\u2014then we can derive the conclusion that he really\nwants, namely that goodness is not identical with what we\ndesire to desire. And by parity or reasoning we can do the same for\nany naturalistic property whatsoever.\n\nNow Moore\u2019s twin assumptions have subsequently fallen upon hard times.\nThe first leads straight to the Paradox of Analysis (see Langford\n1942), whilst the second would exclude synthetic identities such as\nwater is H2O. But if they were correct,\nthe OQA would indeed dispose of the desire-to-desire theory along with\nkindred theories such as Hume\u2019s. It is notable that David Lewis, who\nrevived Russell\u2019s theory in 1989 (without realizing it was Russell\u2019s),\nexplicitly affirms what Moore implicitly denies\u2014that there can\nbe unobvious analytic truths; that is, truths not\nevident to every competent speaker (see Lewis 1989 and Pigden 2007).\nBut if Moore were correct and there were no such things, then\nnaturalistic analyses of the moral concepts such as Russell\u2019s would be\nin big trouble. The BTA only works against some naturalistic\nanalyses of \u201cgood\u201d, namely those that define\n\u201cgood\u201d in terms of some property that the theorist wishes\nto promote. The OQA, if it works at all, works against them all. It\nseems very likely that what prompted Moore to invent his philosophical\nweapon of mass destruction was the desire-to-desire theory of Bertrand\nRussell.\n\nThen why didn\u2019t Moore say so\u2014or at least, why didn\u2019t he\nattribute the desire-to-desire definition to its original inventor?\nBecause Russell propounded his definition at a meeting of the\nApostles, a supposedly secret society. The rather priggish Moore took\nthe code of secrecy very seriously and used to fuss about discussing\nthe doings of the Apostles by postcard in case they were read in\ntransit. (The slightly less priggish Russell had to reassure him that\nonly college porters were likely to read them and only initiates would\nunderstand.) To have attributed the desire-to-desire theory to an\nApostolic paper of Russell\u2019s would have broken the code of silence (a\ncode designed to promote the unfettered exchange of honest\nopinion).\n\nThere is an irony in this episode. The last page of the paper,\n\u201cIs Ethics a Branch of Empirical Psychology?\u201d is marked\nwith a query in Russell\u2019s hand \u201cShall we spell {Good/good}\nwith\u201d, to which Moore replies \u201cGood =\ngood\u201d\u2014which looks like a succinct formulation of his\nfamous no-definition definition of \u201cgood\u201d (\u201cIf I am\nasked \u2018How is good to be defined?\u2019 my answer is that it\ncannot be defined and that is all I have to say about it.\u201d\nPE: 58). If I am right, Russell\u2019s desire-to-desire theory\nposed a problem for Moore which it took him five years to solve. But,\ngiven the annotation, it seems that the debate on Russell\u2019s paper\nbegan a process of conversion that led Russell himself to accept the\ndoctrines of Moore\u2019s Principia Ethica.\n3. Sidgwick\u2019s Problem and the Rejection of Idealism\n\n\u201cWe called him \u2018old Sidg\u2019 and regarded him as merely\nout of date\u201d (My Philosophical Development: 30). So\nsaid Russell of his teacher, the great Victorian moral philosopher,\nHenry Sidgwick (though he later thought that he and his contemporaries\n\u201cdid not give [Sidgwick] nearly as much respect as he\ndeserved\u201d). But though Russell may have regarded Sidgwick as an\nold fogey, he set the agenda for a lot of Russell\u2019s work on ethics in\nthe 1890s. For Russell was much exercised by a problem that also\nbothered Sidgwick: the Dualism of Practical Reason. (See Sidgwick\n1907: 496\u2013516; see also Schulz 2004: ch. 4, in which it becomes\nabundantly clear how very preoccupied Sidgwick was with this problem.)\nAccording to Sidgwick, it is rational to do what is morally right (by\nmaximizing pleasurable consciousness on the part of all sentient\nbeings) and rational to do what is prudentially right (by maximizing\npleasurable consciousness on the part of oneself), but, when the two\ncome into conflict, the one does not seem to be any more rational than\nthe other. If God exists, then He can ensure that it will pay in the\nlong term to promote the public interest, by rewarding the righteous\nin the life to come. What is morally right will coincide with what is\nprudentially right, and that, consequently, is what Practical Reason\nwill command. But if, as Sidgwick was reluctantly inclined to think,\nthere is no God, what is morally right and what is prudentially right\nwill sometimes come apart, and Practical Reason will speak with a\ndivided voice. If it does not always pay to be good, then it is not\nclear that is more rational to be good than to be bad, a conclusion\nthat Sidgwick found deeply disturbing. The rather priggish young\nRussell was bothered by the problem too (a solution, he said, would be\n\u201ca real solid addition to my happiness\u201d) because, like\nSidgwick, he did not believe in God. But as a fashionable young\nphilosopher of the 1890s he did believe in something that he thought\nwould do nearly as well, namely, the Absolute. For at this time,\nRussell, like most of his philosophical contemporaries in the\nEnglish-speaking world, was a neo-Hegelian or Absolute Idealist.\nThough we may seem to be living in a material world and to be\nmaterial boys and girls, this is an Appearance only. Reality, the\nAbsolute, is basically mental, a sort of timeless and harmonious group\nmind of which our separate selves are (perhaps delusory) aspects. As\nBradley put it,\n\n\nthe Absolute is one system, and \u2026 its contents are nothing but\nsentient experience. It will hence be a single and all-inclusive\nexperience, which embraces every partial diversity in concord. For it\ncannot be less than appearance, and hence no feeling or thought, of\nany kind, can fall outside its limits. (1930 [1893]: 129)\n\n\n(We stress that it is hard to present this doctrine concisely without\ngross caricature.) But there was a crucial difference between\nMcTaggart and Bradley, the two leading idealists of Russell\u2019s day.\nMcTaggart believed in personal immortality and claimed the harmony\nthat already exists timelessly (so to speak) \u201cmust some day\nbecome explicit\u201d (McTaggart 1996 [1893]: 210\u2013211). Bradley\ndid not.\n\nAt first Russell was an adherent of McTaggart. This afforded him a\nneat solution to Sidgwick\u2019s problem. The happy day when the harmony\nbecomes explicit can be promoted or retarded by human action. If I\nbenefit myself at your expense not only am I doing down a self with\nwhom I am, in Reality, intimately linked\u2014I am putting off the\nday when the harmony that Really Is becomes apparent. And since this\nharmony will be supremely pleasurable I am harming myself into the\nbargain. Hence morality and self-interest coincide and Practical\nReason is reunited with itself (Russell, 1893, \u201cOn the\nFoundations of Ethics\u201d, RoE:\n37\u201340/Papers 1: 206\u2013211). This illustrates the\npoint made by a number of unkind critics, that in the late\n19th century Absolute Idealism functioned as a sort of\nmethadone program for high-minded Victorian intellectuals, providing\nthem with moral uplift as they struggled to get off the hard stuff of\nofficial Christianity. (See Stove 1991: chs. 5 & 6; Allard 2003\nand, in more restrained language, Griffin 2003b: pp. 85\u201388.)\nBefore long however, Russell moved over to Bradley\u2019s camp and ceased\nto believe that the timelessly existing harmony would become manifest\nin time. Nevertheless, since we are all aspects of the Absolute, a\nsort of timeless super-self, there is essentially the same objection\nto indulging my desires at your expense as there is to indulging one\nof my own passions at the expense of others which are inconsistent\nwith it. I am hurting, if not myself, at least a larger whole of which\nwe are both parts (Russell, 1894, \u201cCleopatra or Maggie\nTulliver\u201d, RoE: 57\u201367/Papers I:\n92\u20138). But before long even this solution ceased to satisfy. In\na paper not published until 1957, \u201cSeems Madam? Nay It\nIs\u201d, Russell argued (as he put it to Moore) that \u201cfor all\npurposes that are not purely intellectual, the world of\nAppearance is the real world\u201d. In particular, the hypothesis\nthat there is a timeless and harmonious Reality provides no\nconsolation for our present pains since it is a Reality that we never\nget to experience. If \u201cthe world of daily life remains wholly\nunaffected by [Reality], and goes on its way just as if there were no\nworld of Reality at all\u201d, and if this world of Reality is a\nworld that we not only do not but cannot experience\n(since experience is necessarily temporal), how can its alleged\nexistence afford us any consolation for what seems to be (and\ntherefore is) evil in the world of Appearance? (Russell,\n1897, \u201cSeems, Madam? Nay, It Is\u201d, RoE:\n79\u201386/Papers 1: 105\u2013111/Why I am Not a\nChristian: 75\u201382).\n\nNow this argument has an interesting corollary which Russell does not\nexplicitly draw. It may be that in Reality the pains I inflict on you\naffect me\u2014or at least a larger mind-like thing in which we both\nparticipate\u2014but if I never experience those effects,\nhow can this give me a motive to do or forbear if my interests\nconflict with yours? How can the fact that you and I are in Reality\none (or at least part of one) give me a reason to look out for you, if\nthis oneness is something I never experience? If Absolute Idealism can\nprovide no consolation for life\u2019s disasters\u2014which is what\nRussell is explicitly arguing\u2014then it seems that it cannot\nsupply me with a reason not to visit those disasters on you, if doing\nso is likely to benefit me. It may be that I suffer in a metaphysical\nsort of way when I profit at your expence, but if this suffering is\nsomething I never feel (since I am effectively confined to\nthe world of Appearance) why should this bother me? Thus the Dualism\nof Practical Reason reasserts itself. Sometimes what is morally right\nis at odds with what is prudentially right and when it is, there seems\nno reason to prefer the one to the other.\n\nWhether Russell realized this is not entirely clear. What is clear is\nthat \u201cSeems, Madam? Nay, It Is\u201d marks the beginning of the\nend for Russell\u2019s Absolute Idealism. Once he realized that\n\n\nfor all purposes that are not purely intellectual [including\nperhaps the purpose of providing moral uplift] the world of Appearance\nis the real world,\n\n\nRussell came to feel that the world of Reality was no use for purely\nintellectual purposes either and soon resolved to do without it. A big\n\u201cR\u201d Reality, that could neither console us for life\u2019s\ntroubles nor reconcile Duty and Interest, was a big \u201cR\u201d\nReality that might as well not exist. The methadone of Absolute\nIdealism having failed, Russell was forced to accept appearances at\nface value.\n\nBut what about the problem of the Dualism of Practical Reason? In\nlater life, Russell ceased to worry about it perhaps because he\nrealized that it is a problem that cannot be resolved. The Cosmos of\nDuty really is a Chaos (as Sidgwick rather colorfully put it). Duty\nand Interest can come into conflict, and when they do, there\nis no decisive reason for preferring the one to the other. All you can\ndo is to try to instill moral and altruistic motivations, which is\nwhat Russell tried to do with his children. But when they asked\nwhy they should care about other people (as his daughter Kate\ndefiantly did) his response was rather lame.\n\n\nKate:\n\u201cI don\u2019t want to! Why should I?\u201d\nRussell:\n\u201cBecause more people will be happier if you do than if you\ndon\u2019t.\u201d\nKate:\n\u201cSo what? I don\u2019t care about other people.\u201d\nRussell:\n\u201cYou should.\u201d\nKate:\n\u201cBut why?\u201d\nRussell:\n\u201cBecause more people will be happier if you do than if you\ndon\u2019t.\u201d (RoE: 16; Tait 1975: 185)\n\n\n\nThis isn\u2019t much of an answer, but since the Cosmos of Duty really is a\nChaos, it was perhaps the best that Russell could do.\n4. Russell versus Moore: Two Kinds of Consequentialism\n\nAlthough Russell became a convert to the doctrines of Principia\nEthica, he disagreed with Moore on two important points. Russell,\nlike Moore was what is nowadays known as a consequentialist. He\nbelieved that the rightness or otherwise of an act is \u201cin some\nway, dependent on consequences\u201d. But for the young Moore, it is\n\u201cdemonstrably certain\u201d (!) that \u201cI am morally bound\nto perform this action\u201d is identical [that is\nsynonymous] with the assertion \u201cThis action will produce the\ngreatest amount of possible good in the Universe\u201d (PE:\nch. 5, \u00a789). Thus it is analytic that the right thing to\ndo is the action that will, actually produce the best\nconsequences. But in Russell\u2019s view this claim is neither analytic nor\ntrue. Moore\u2019s own Open Question Argument can be deployed to prove that\nit is not analytic, and a little critical reflection reveals that it\nis not true.\n\n\nIt is held [by Moore] that what we ought to do is that action, among\nall that are possible, which will produce the best results on the\nwhole; and this is regarded as constituting a definition of\nought. I hold that this is not a definition, but a\nsignificant proposition, and in fact a false one. (RoE:\n101/Papers 4: 573)\n\n\nIt is a \u201csignificant\u201d or non-analytic proposition because\na competent speaker can believe that X is the act that will\nproduce the best consequences without believing that she ought to do\nit. If the two propositions \u201cX is the act available to me\nthat will produce the best consequences\u201d and \u201cI ought to\ndo X\u201d were really synonymous, then a competent\nspeaker could not believe the one whilst remaining in doubt about the\nother. Since this is perfectly possible (as is shown by the fact that\n\u201cOught I to do what will have the best results?\u201d is an\nobstinately open question for competent speakers of English) the two\nclaims are not synonymous. (W.D. Ross developed a similar line of\nargument in The Right and the Good (1930) but it was Russell\nwho convinced Moore that he was wrong. See Moore 1942: 558).\n\nBut the fact that these claims are not synonymous does not show that\nit is false that I ought to do that act which will, in\nfact, produce the best consequences. The latter claim could be\nsynthetic (or, as Russell would have it, \u201csignificant\u201d)\nbut true. Why does Russell think it false? Russell raises the ad\nhominem objection that Moore\u2019s thesis is flatly inconsistent with\nthe moral conservatism that he goes on to embrace. According to Moore,\nalthough \u201cthere are cases where [an established moral] rule\nshould be broken\u201d, since \u201cin some cases the neglect of an\nestablished moral rule will be the best course of action\npossible\u201d, nevertheless, \u201cwe can never know what those\ncases are, and ought, therefore, never to break it\u201d\n(PE: \u00a799). \u201cThe individual, therefore, can be\nconfidently recommended always to conform to rules which are\ngenerally useful and generally practiced.\u201d But if we ought to\nperform the best action possible, what this implies is that there are\nsome cases (though we can never know which) where we ought to do what\nit is not the case that we ought to do. Moore could avoid this\ncontradiction by adopting the view that what we ought to do is that\naction which we have reason to believe will produce the best\nconsequences. As Russell himself put it, Moore\u2019s moral conservatism\n\u201cimplies that we ought to do what we have reason to\nthink will have the best results, rather than what really\nwill have the best results\u201d [my italics]\u2014since,\nin any given instance, we may have reason to think that the\nconventionally right act will have the best consequences even though\nwe know that this won\u2019t always be the case.\n\nBut Russell did not reject Moore\u2019s brand of consequentialism because\nit was inconsistent with his moral conservatism, since he\nalso rejected Moore\u2019s moral conservatism. As he informed\nMoore by letter, he regarded his views on Practical Ethics as\n\u201cunduly Conservative and anti-reforming\u201d. However, anybody\nwho thinks that there are some actions which we ought to do\neven though, as a matter of fact they won\u2019t have the best consequences\nmust, reject Moore\u2019s view. And it is precisely because he believes\nthis that Russell rejects Moore\u2019s brand of consequentialism.\n\u201cSome people\u201d, says Russell, \u201cwhom I refrain from\nnaming, might with advantage to the world have been strangled in\ninfancy; but we cannot blame the good women who brought them up for\nhaving omitted this precaution.\u201d So if Stalin\u2019s mother (say) did\nthe right thing in not strangling him at birth, then it\nfollows that the right thing to do is not always the act with the best\nactual consequences. Russell admits that his view is not without\nparadox, since if it sometimes right to do what is actually\ndisastrous, it follows that it can sometimes be \u201ca pity [that] a\nman did his duty\u201d, a thesis which Moore regards as \u201ca\ncontradiction in terms\u201d. But paradoxical as this may seem, it is\nonly a contradiction on the assumption that \u201cthe right\naction\u201d simply means \u201cthe action with the best\nactual consequences\u201d, an assumption which Moore\u2019s own Open\nQuestion Argument proves to be false. Moore\u2019s view, by contrast, is\ncontradictory however \u201cright\u201d and \u201cought\u201d are\nto be defined, since it implies that we sometimes ought to perform\nacts which (since they are not optimific) it is not the case that we\nought to perform.\n\nRussell\u2019s criticisms can be summed up as follows:\n\nIt is false that \u201cI am morally bound/I ought/it is right for\nme to perform this action\u201d is synonymous with the\nassertion \u201cThis action will produce the greatest amount of\npossible good in the Universe\u201d, since the Open Question Argument\ncan be deployed mutatis mutandis to prove otherwise.\nMoore subscribes to three theses that are flat-out contradictory:\n\n\nWe ought to perform those acts that will in fact produce the best\nconsequences.\nFollowing established rules does not always result in acts that\nproduce the best consequences.\nWe ought to follow the established rules.\n\n\nThese three theses jointly imply that we sometimes ought to do things\nthat it is not the case that we ought to do. Russell gently points out\nthis contradiction and suggests, in effect, that Moore could resolve\nit by modifying (1) to (1\u2032).\n\n1\u2032.\nWe ought to perform those acts which it is reasonable to\nbelieve will produce the best consequences.\n \nThe \u201cgood women\u201d who brought up the likes of Hitler\nand Stalin cannot be blamed for not strangling them in infancy. This\nsuggests that it was right of them to refrain even though the actual\nconsequences of their acts of forbearance turned out to be horrendous.\nThus the right thing to do is not that act which will\nactually produce the best consequences but that act which it\nis reasonable to believe will produce the best\nconsequences.\n\n\nMoore accepted argument A (see his \u201cReply to My Critics\u201d:\n558), and in his later book Ethics (1912) he treats\nconsequentialism as a synthetic thesis.\n\n\nIt is, I think, quite plain that the meaning of the two words\n[\u201cexpedience\u201d and \u201cduty\u201d] is not the\nsame; for if it were, then it would be a mere tautology to say that it\nis always our duty to do what will have the best possible\nconsequences. Our theory does not, therefore, do away with the\ndistinction between the meaning of the two words\n\u201cduty\u201d and \u201cexpediency\u201d; it only implies that\nboth will always apply to the same actions. (Ethics: 89)\n\n\nHe also seems to have accepted Russell\u2019s ad hominem argument\nB\u2014that, given the fairly obvious fact that doing the done thing\ndoes not always produce the best results, his actualist brand of\nconsequentialism is inconsistent with his moral conservatism. However,\nhe did not resolve the problem by modifying thesis (1) as Russell, in\neffect, recommended\u2014instead he resolved it by dropping thesis\n(3). In Principia, moral conservatism had been\n\u201cconfidently recommended\u201d to the conscientious\n\u201cindividual\u201d. By the time Moore came to write\nEthics in 1912 it had simply disappeared, leaving the puzzled\n\u201cindividual\u201d bereft of practical guidance. What ought the\nindividual to do, when, as is usually the case, she cannot determine,\nwhich of the available acts will have the best total consequences?\nMoore does not say, thereby sacrificing helpfulness to theoretical\nconsistency.\n5. Politics, Consequentialism and the Need for Skepticism\n\nDry and abstract as these disputes may seem, they are not devoid of\npractical import. A common complaint against consequentialism is that\nit encourages the consequentialist to do evil that good may come. If\nthe goods to be achieved or the evils to be averted are sufficiently\nlarge, it may be not only permissible but obligatory to\ntorture prisoners, execute hostages or to massacre civilians\u2014so\nlong as there is no other, less costly, way to achieve the goods or\navert the evils. This is not only objectionable in itself\u2014it\nencourages ruthless types to commit horrors in the here and now for\nthe sake of some imagined utopia, whilst pretending to themselves and\nothers that they are actuated by the highest motives. Because in\nprinciple consequentialism licenses doing evil that good may\ncome, in practice it encourages fanatics to do evil even when\nthe good to come is highly unlikely. In his \u201cNewly Discovered\nMaxims of la Rochefoucauld\u201d, Russell remarks that \u201cthe\npurpose of morality is to allow people to inflict suffering without\ncompunction\u201d (Fact and Fiction: 184). And\nconsequentialist moralities have enabled some of their devotees to\ninflict a great deal of suffering, not only without compunction, but\noften with an insufferable air of moral smugness.\n\nBy adopting expected utility as the criterion of right action\nRussell goes some way towards meeting these objections. In practice\nwhen people propose to perpetrate horrors for the sake of some greater\ngood, the horrors are usually certain and the greater good is highly\nspeculative. In weighing up the options, the good to be achieved by\nsome tough course of action must be multiplied by the probability of\nachieving it, which is always a fraction of one, and often a rather\nsmall fraction at that. So although doing evil that good may come is\nnot excluded in principle, the expected utility theorist is\nfar less likely to do it in practice\u2014at least if he or she is\nintellectually honest. The classless society (let us suppose) would be\na very good thing, but I am probably not justified in shooting the\nhostages to bring it about. For I can be certain that if I shoot them,\nthe hostages will be dead, whereas the probability that shooting them\nwill bring about the classless society is very low. Moreover there is\nlikely to be an as-good-or-better chance that I can bring about the\nclassless society without shooting the hostages. Thus even if\nthe classless society would be supremely good, the expected utility\ntheorist will not be justified in shooting the hostages to bring it\nabout. The expected utility theorist may be obliged to do evil that\ngood may come, but only if the good is large, highly likely given the\nevil, and most unlikely without the evil. These conditions\nare seldom met.\n\nThus Russell could use the criterion of expected utility\nagainst warmongers and enthusiasts for revolutionary violence who\nemployed utilitarian patterns of reasoning to inflict suffering\nwithout compunction. It was (for example) one of his chief weapons in\nhis polemics against the Bolsheviks during the 1920s. As he wrote in a\nreview of Bukharin\u2019s Historical Materialism,\n\n\nwe do not know enough about the laws of social phenomena to be able to\npredict the future with any certainty, even in its broadest outlines\n\u2026 For this reason, it is unwise to adopt any policy involving\ngreat immediate suffering for the sake of even a great gain in the\ndistant future, because the gain may never be realized (RoE:\n203/Papers 9: 371).\n\n\nThus despite the desirability of socialism (in Russell\u2019s eyes at any\nrate) the Bolshevik program had to be rejected for utilitarian or\nconsequentialist reasons. (See also The Practice and Theory\nof Bolshevism, particularly Part II. ch.iv.) The Bolshevik\n\u201chabit of militant certainty about doubtful matters\u201d\n(Practice and Theory: xi) was not only irrational, but\ndangerous, since it led to pointless suffering. Hence\n\u201cThe Need for Political Skepticism\u201d, the title of one of\nRussell\u2019s essays, and a major theme in his moral and political writing\n(Sceptical Essays: ch. 11). Dogmatism leads to cruelty since\nit encourages people to overestimate the likelihood that their\nobjectives will be realized and hence to exaggerate the expected\nutility of persecuting policies. Scepticism (or\n\u201cfallibilism\u201d as we would nowadays tend to say) is the\nantidote. Hence the maxim that Russell puts into the mouth of la\nRochefoucauld: \u201cIt does not matter what you believe, so long as\nyou don\u2019t altogether believe it\u201d (Fact and Fiction:\n185).\n6. Consequentialism, Emotivism and Moral Reform\n\nThe criterion of expected utility had another advantage for Russell.\nIt allowed him to recommend a less \u201cconservative and\nanti-reforming\u201d version of Moore\u2019s principle that \u201cthe\nindividual can be confidently recommended \u2026 to conform to rules\nwhich are generally useful and generally practiced.\u201d Russell was\nan act-consequentialist rather than a rule-consequentialist. An act is\nright if the expected consequences of performing it are as good or\nbetter than any other. It is not right because it conforms to some\nrule, even a rule that it is generally useful to obey. Nevertheless,\nrules are necessary because we do not have world enough and time to\ncalculate the consequences of every act.\n\n\nI think that, speaking philosophically, all acts ought to be judged by\ntheir effects; but as this is difficult and uncertain and takes time,\nit is desirable, in practice, that some kinds of acts should be\ncondemned and others praised without waiting to investigate\nconsequences. I should say, therefore, with the utilitarians, that the\nright act, in any given circumstances, is that which, on the data,\nwill probably produce the greatest balance of good over evil of all\nthe acts that are possible; but that the performance of such acts may\nbe promoted by the existence of a moral code. (RoE:\n216/Power: 168)\n\n\nThus Russell believed that it is generally right to obey\n\u201cgenerally useful\u201d rules, though these are \u201crules of\nthumb\u201d and there may be circumstances in which it is right (that\nis obligatory) to break them.\n\n\nEven the best moral rules, however, will have some\nexceptions, since no class of actions always has bad [or\ngood!] results. (RoE: 137/Religion and Science:\n227\u20138)\n\n\nBut though Russell thought it is generally right to obey generally\nuseful rules, he also thought that many of the rules that are\n\u201cgenerally practiced\u201d are not \u201cgenerally\nuseful\u201d. Sometimes they derive from bygone superstitions and\nsometimes they foster the interests of the powerful at other peoples\nexpense.\n\n\nPrimitive ethics \u2026select certain modes of behavior for censure\n[or praise] for reasons which are lost in anthropological obscurity.\n(Education and the Social Order: 23)\n\n\nHowever,\n\n\none of the purposes\u2014usually in large part unconscious\u2014of a\ntraditional morality is to make the existing social system work. It\nachieves this purpose, when it is successful, both more cheaply and\nmore effectively than a police force does \u2026 The most obvious\nexample \u2026 is the inculcation of obedience. It is (or rather\nwas) the duty of children to submit to parents, wives to husbands,\nservants to masters, subjects to princes, and (in religious matters)\nlaymen to priests. (RoE: 207/Power: 157)\n\n\nThus Russell was inclined to agree with Plato\u2019s Thrasymachus, at least\nto the extent that what passes for justice is often\n[to] the advantage of the stronger [that is the ruling caste, class or\ngender]. Russell was opposed both to power-moralities (codes designed\nto bolster the interests of exploitative elites) and to the senseless\nand often pernicious remnants of defunct superstitions.\n\n\nAn ethic not derived from superstition must decide first upon the kind\nof social effects which it desires to achieve and the social effects\nwhich it desires to avoid. It must then decide, as far as knowledge\npermits, what acts will promote the desired consequences: these acts\nit will praise, while those acts having a contrary tendency it will\ncondemn. (Education and the Social Order: 73)\n\n\nIt was Russell\u2019s mission as a practical moralist, a social reformer\nand a popular sage to promote a humane and non-superstitious ethic.\nThis was partly a matter of preaching and partly a matter of argument:\npreaching as regards ends and argument as regards means.\n\nIn the latter, and more preachy, part of his career, it was Russell\u2019s\ndominant view that judgments about what things are good or bad as ends\ndo not have a truth-value. To say that it is a good thing \u201cthat\nthe individual, like Leibniz\u2019s monads should mirror the world\u201d\n(Education and the Social Order: 10) is to say something like\n\u201cWould that everyone desired that the individual, like one of\nLeibniz\u2019s monads, should mirror the world!\u201d Since this is\nneither true nor false, it cannot be rationally argued for. The best\nwe can do is to remove objections and present the end in a favorable\nlight. Russell was perfectly clear about this.\n\n\nWhy [should the individual mirror the world]? I cannot say why, except\nthat knowledge and comprehensiveness appear to me glorious attributes\nin virtue of which I prefer Newton to an oyster. The man who holds\nconcentrated within his own mind, as within a camera obscura,\nthe depths of space, the evolution of the sun and its planets, the\ngeological ages of the earth, and the brief history of humanity,\nappears to me to be doing what is distinctively human and what adds\nmost to the diversified spectacle of nature.\n\n\nThis is eloquent stuff (and too me, at least, convincing) but it\nhardly constitutes an argument. And this Russell freely admitted.\n\n\nUltimate values are not matters as to which argument is possible. If a\nman maintains that misery is desirable and that it would be a good\nthing if everybody always had a violent toothache, we may disagree\nwith him, and we may laugh at him if we catch him going to the\ndentist, but we cannot prove that he is mistaken as we could if he\nsaid that iron is lighter than water \u2026 As to ultimate values,\nmen may agree or disagree, they may fight with guns or with ballot\npapers but they cannot reason logically. (Education and the Social\nOrder: 136)\n\n\nThis is rather disconcerting, especially if we replace the comic\nexamples that Russell employs in Education and the Social\nOrder (he imagines a prophet \u201cwho advance[s] the theory\nthat happiness should be confined to those whose first names begin\nwith Z\u201d) with the real-life moral elitists and chauvinists that\nhe discusses in other works of the 1930s and 1940s. Nietzsche and the\nNazis really did believe that the sufferings of some people were not\nsignificant evils (herd-men in the case of Nietzsche, Jews, Slavs and\nGypsies in the case of the Nazis) and it was Russell\u2019s thesis that no\nrational argument could be advanced against them.\n\n\nLet us consider two theories as to the good. One says, like\nChristianity, Kant, and democracy: whatever the good may be, any one\nman\u2019s enjoyment of it has the same value as any other man\u2019s. The other\nsays: there is a certain sub-class of mankind\u2014white men,\nGermans, gentiles, or what not\u2014whose good or evil alone counts\nin an estimation of ends; other men are only to be considered as means\n\u2026 When [irrelevant] arguments are swept away, there remains, so\nfar as I can see, nothing to be said except for each party to express\nmoral disapproval of the other. Those who reject this conclusion\nadvance no argument against it except that it is unpleasant.\n(\u201cReply to Criticisms\u201d RoE: 146\u2013147/Papers\n11: 48\u201349)\n\n\nBut unpleasant as this conclusion may be, it does not imply that those\nwith a humane and egalitarian conception of the good should give up\npreaching on its behalf. On the contrary, such preaching becomes\nimperative, especially for those with rhetorical gifts. Which is why\nRussell devoted so much time and effort to this activity.\n\n\nAccording to me, the person who judges that A is good is\nwishing others to feel certain desires. He will therefore, if not\nhindered by other activities, try to rouse these desires in other\npeople if he thinks he knows how to do so. This is the purpose of\npreaching, and it was my purpose in the various books in which I have\nexpressed ethical opinions. The art of presenting one\u2019s desires\npersuasively is totally different from that of logical demonstration,\nbut it is equally legitimate. (\u201cReply to Criticisms\u201d\nRoE: 149/Papers 11: 51)\n\n\nPersuasion as regards ends may be a non-rational process, but that\ndoes not mean that it is irrational, let alone wrong, to\nengage in it.\n\nWhen it comes to means however, rational argument becomes a genuine\npossibility. It might seem otherwise since judgments about what is\nright or what ought to be done\u2014which for Russell are essentially\nconcerned with means\u2014would appear to be as incapable of truth as\njudgments about what is good and bad. In Russell\u2019s view, \u201cthe\nright act, in any given circumstances, is that which, on the\ndata, will probably produce the greatest balance of good over\nevil\u201d and the right rule or policy is likewise\nthe one that can be expected to produce the best effects. That is,\n\u201cX is right\u201d is assertible (roughly, a\nsensible thing to say) when X can be expected to lead to the\nbest results. But if \u201cY is good\u201d, is really in the\noptative mood, amounting to the exclamation \u201cWould that everyone\ndesired Y!\u201d, then \u201cX is right\u201d would\nappear to be optative too, since it comes down to something like\n\u201cX leads to more of what [would that everyone\ndesired!]\u201d. Here, the clause in square brackets, which is\nobviously in the optative mood, infects the entire sentence with its\noptative character. \u201cX leads to more of what [would that\neveryone desired!]\u201d, in so far as it can be made sense of, does\nnot seem to be the kind of thing that could be true or false.\n\nHowever, Russell believed that judgments about what is right or what\nought to be done can be given an analysis which gives them a\nsort of ersatz objectivity and hence the possibility of truth. If\nDmitri has a reasonably determinate conception of the good, that is, a\ncoherent set of opinions about which things are good and which bad,\nthen although Dmitri\u2019s opinions themselves are neither true\nnor false\u2014since, despite appearances they are not really\nopinions at all but optative expressions of Dmitri\u2019s desires\u2014it\ncan nevertheless be true or false that X is good in Dmitri\u2019s\nopinion, that is, good-according-to-Dmitri. \u201cOh to be in\nEngland, now that April\u2019s here!\u201d is neither true nor false, but\nif I say it sincerely, it will in fact be true that I desire to be in\nEngland. Similarly, if Dmitri says that \u201cBungy-jumping is\ngood\u201d what he says won\u2019t be true, since really it is in the\noptative mood, but if he says it sincerely, it will be true that\nBungy-jumping is good-in-Dmitri\u2019s-opinion, or\ngood-according-to-Dmitri. Thus although there are no facts of the\nmatter about which things are good or bad, there are facts of\nthe matter about which things are believed by this or that\nperson to be good or bad. Furthermore\u2014and this is the crucial\npoint\u2014there are facts of the matter about whether a given action\nor a given policy is likely to promote what somebody-or-other\nbelieves to be good. Since Hitler believed that victory over\nBritain would be good, there was a fact of the matter about whether\nbombing London as opposed to bombing the RAF\u2019s airfields would be\nlikely bring about the states of affairs that he desired. As it turned\nout, the policy he pursued did not produce results that were\nbest-according-to-Hitler. Hence if Hitler had adopted a\nconsequentialist reading of \u201cought\u201d, and had indexed it to\nhis own requirements, \u201cI ought to bomb London\u201d (as said by\nHitler) would have been false. And its truth or its falsehood\nwould have been a factually arguable question.\n\nNow, suppose we define the right act with respect to\nB, not as \u201cthat which, on the data, will probably produce\nthe greatest balance of good over evil\u201d but as \u201cthat\nwhich, on the data, will probably produce the greatest balance of what\nB believes to be good over what B believes to be\nevil\u201d. The right rule of policy with respect to B will\ncorrespondingly be defined as the rule or policy that will probably,\nin the appropriate circumstances, produce the greatest balance of what\nB believes to be good over what B believes to be\nevil. Then, so long as B has a reasonably coherent set of\nideals, the claim that a given act or policy is right or wrong with\nrespect to B will usually have a determinate truth-value.\nClaims of the form \u201cX is right wrt to B\u201d\nwill be either true or false, so long as the person (or group of\npersons) designated by B has a clear and consistent set of\nvalues. There will thus be a fact of the matter about whether X\nis right wrt to B which can be the subject of rational enquiry.\nAnd if \u201cB\u201d stands in for us (whoever\n\u201cwe\u201d may be) and if we share a reasonably\ncoherent set of ideals, then there will be a fact of the matter about\nwhether X is right or wrong with respect to our ideals. Thus if\nthere is agreement with respect to ideals and if we adopt a\nconsequentialist conception of rightness, indexed, not to what\nis good, but to what we believe to be good, then we\ncan have a rational debate\u2014maybe even a scientific\nenquiry\u2014about the rights and wrongs of actions, rules or\npolicies, or at least about their rightness or wrongness with respect\nto us.\n\n\nThe framing of moral rules, so long as the ultimate Good is supposed\nknown, [Russell should have said \u2018supposed agreed\u2019] is a\nmatter for science. For example: should capital punishment be\ninflicted for theft, or only for murder, or not at all? Jeremy\nBentham, who considered pleasure to be the Good, devoted himself to\nworking out what criminal code would most promote pleasure, and\nconcluded that it ought to be much less severe than that prevailing in\nhis day. All this, except the proposition that pleasure is the Good,\ncomes within the sphere of science. (RoE:\n137\u2013138/Religion and Science: 228\u2013229)\n\n\nOnce the ends have been agreed, we can have a rational debate about\nthe code most likely to promote those ends. In some cases, such\nquestions can be resolved by scientific enquiry, or at any rate by\nstatistics. But (with one or two exceptions) rational argument is only\nreally possible when we take the ends as read and confine our\nattention to the means.\n\nWe are now in a position to understand Russell\u2019s general strategy as a\npolemicist for moral reform and its relation to his emotivist\nmeta-ethic.\n\nHe dismisses supposed duties that cannot be given a\nconsequentialist justification as the products of bygone superstitions\nor, in some cases, the ideological props to predatory elites.\nHe uses non-rational methods to preach the goodness of some\nends\u2014a life inspired by love and guided by knowledge, mirroring\nthe cosmos like one of Leibniz\u2019s monads etc.\u2014and the evil of\nothers. This is essentially a process of getting his readers to share\nhis desires.\nHe then argues for his revised code of conduct as likely to\npromote those ends. Here there can be truth and falsehood and\nconsequently rational argument, but only because \u201cought\u201d\nand \u201cright\u201d have been given a consequentialist reading and\nindexed to the ends that Russell desires to promote.\n\n7. Russell\u2019s Ideal: the Influence of Spinoza\n\nBefore going on to discuss Russell\u2019s meta-ethic in more detail, it is\nworth pausing for a moment to consider his ideal. For although Russell\nclaimed to make his \u201cpractical moral judgments\u201d on a\n\u201croughly hedonistic basis\u201d (RoE:\n165\u20136/Papers 11: 311), he was far from being an out-and\nout hedonist. He was, as we have seen, a utilitarian of sorts, who\nbelieved that the right thing to do is the action that, on the\navailable evidence, seems likely to produce the best balance of good\nover evil consequences. Since we cannot perform the requisite\ncalculations in every case, we need codes of conduct, though these\nshould be taken with a pinch of salt and reassessed from time to time\nin the light of new information. This is sensible and humane, but\nperhaps a little pedestrian. However Russell\u2019s conception of the\ngood\u2014the end to be promoted\u2014is a bit more interesting. To\nbegin with, although he valued human happiness, he did not see this in\ncrudely hedonistic terms. However pleasurable the life of a pig may\nbe, Russell would not have preferred the life of a pig to that of a\nhuman being. Russell also valued passion and a life which\nallowed for spontaneous (but \u201ccreative\u201d) impulses. These\nviews distinguish him from the classical utilitarians who he otherwise\nadmired. However, the really distinctive features of Russell\u2019s ethic\nwere derived from Spinoza (1632\u20131677), who remained a\nphilosophical hero even though Russell rejected most of his\nmetaphysics as set out (rather confusingly) in his Ethics of\n1677. There was something about Spinoza\u2019s attitude to life that\nRussell regarded as profoundly right. Kenneth Blackwell calls this\n\u201cthe ethic of impersonal self-enlargement\u201d (Blackwell\n1985: 17). According to this ideal, the best life is lived in\nawareness of the Other. This includes other selves (since Russell\nconsidered a purely selfish life unfulfilling, and a life without\nhistory\u2014which involves knowledge of other\nselves\u2014drab) but also the wholly other\u2014the\nnon-human universe of large impersonal forces, the wind, the sea, the\nmountains and the stars and even (if they exist) the entities of\nmathematics. He felt that the self is enlarged by the contemplation of\nthe not-self and that the person whose concerns are limited to their\nown states of mind has confined themself within a spiritual prison. By\nthe same token, a philosophy that reduces reality to an emanation\neither of the self or of the collective reduces the self by denying it\naccess to the Other. All this may sound unduly elevated, but in\npractice what this means is that the good person takes an interest in\nother people (including people who may not be connected with them) and\nin the world at large. Russell sometimes talks about contemplation in\nthis connection, but this should not be understood as a purely passive\nprocess. The contemplative person does not just sit and stare (though\nRussell was not averse to this kind of contemplation) but actively\nseeks to know the Other through science, history and other forms of\nenquiry. Thus Russell\u2019s distaste for idealism and for anti-realist and\ninstrumentalist philosophies of science is connected with his ideal of\nimpersonal self-enlargement. Of course Russell does not attempt to\nderive an Is (such as the claim that idealism or pragmatism\nis false) from an Ought (such as the claim that we\nought to enlarge the Self through contemplation of the Other,\nsomething that would be difficult if either of these philosophies were\ncorrect). But he does suggest that there is something morally suspect,\nas well as wrong-headed, about attempts to reduce the vast forces of\nnature to human experience or to useful predictive devices enabling\nhuman beings to achieve their puny ends. For Russell the good life is\na life that looks outward, which is one reason for his dislike of\nphilosophies that diminish what is outside ourselves into something\nnot worth looking at. (See RoE: 223\u2013235 and, more\ngenerally, The Conquest of Happiness, 1930.)\n8. Objections to Emotivism and Relativism\n\nA we have seen, Russell\u2019s meta-ethic was closely connected to his\nprogram of moral reform. The idea was to advocate a set of humane and\negalitarian ends, using non-rational methods of persuasion, and then\nto argue on the basis of psychology, social science, history and\ncommon sense that that these ends would be best achieved if, on the\nwhole, people obeyed a reformed moral code. Judgments that this or\nthat is good or bad were to be construed as disguised optatives\n(\u201cWould that everyone desired X!\u201d and \u201cWould\nthat everyone desired not Y!\u201d respectively).\n\u201cOught\u201d and \u201cright\u201d were to be given a\nconsequentialist reading and indexed to the ends that Russell hoped\nhis audience could be persuaded to share. Thus Russell combined an\nemotivist analysis of \u201cgood\u201d and \u201cbad\u201d with a\nconsequentialist/relativist reading of \u201cought\u201d and\n\u201cright\u201d. But was he right to do so?\n\nAlthough Russell and Santayana were toying with emotivism in the\n1910s, it was not until the 1930s that the theory really hit the\nphilosophical headlines. Since then it has taken a beating, and\nalthough it still finds favor with the semi-philosophical public, it\nis no longer widely believed by professional philosophers. Relativism\nlikewise is generally regarded as a down-list option, though, as with\nemotivism, there are one or two distinguished philosophers who are\nprepared to stick up for it. Does Russell\u2019s meta-ethic stand up\nagainst the objections that have laid emotivism and relativism\nlow?\n8.1 The Vicious Circle Problem\n\nAccording to Stevenson and Ayer the function of moral judgments is to\nexpress approval and disapproval. But to approve of X is to\nthink or feel that X is good or right: to disapprove is to\nthink or feel that it is bad or wrong. Thus the emotivist analysis of\nthe moral terms is viciously circular. (Russell himself had developed\na similar line of argument against theories which identify rightness\nwith a tendency to arouse approval in his \u201cThe Elements of\nEthics\u201d (1912).)\n\nThis objection leaves Russell untouched. To approve of X may be\nto think or feel that X is good, but for Russell to think\nX good is not to approve of it, but to desire that everyone\nshould desire X. Implausible as this may be, there is no\ncircle, vicious or otherwise.\n8.2 The Problem of the Disappearing Dispute\n\nIf judgments about what is good or bad in itself merely express\napproval and disapproval, then \u201cX is good\u201d said by\nme and \u201cX is bad\u201d said by you do not contradict\none another. After all, I am merely expressing my feelings whilst you\nare expressing yours, and there is nothing remotely inconsistent about\nthe supposition that X arouses approval in me and disapproval\nin you. But plainly when I call X good and you call it bad we\nare contradicting one other. Hence emotivism, which seems to\nimply otherwise, is false.\n\nAgain, Russell\u2019s brand of emotivism is immune to this objection.\nAccording to Russell, \u201cX is good\u201d and\n\u201cX is bad\u201d are really in the optative mood despite\ntheir indicative appearances. As such, they express desires or wishes,\nand desires and wishes can, in a sense, be inconsistent with one\nother, namely when they are not (in Russell\u2019s phrase)\n\u201ccompossible\u201d, that is, when they cannot both be realized.\n\u201cWould that I had all the ice-cream!\u201d said by me and\n\u201cWould that I had all the ice-cream!\u201d said by you\nexpress contradictory desires since we cannot both have all the\nice-cream. As such, the two optatives contradict each other, not\nbecause they describe incompatible facts but because\nthey prescribe incompatible states of affairs.\nSimilarly \u201cX is good\u201d said by me and\n\u201cX is bad\u201d said by you express contradictory\ndesires and hence contradict each other. For \u201cX is\ngood\u201d means \u201cWould that everybody desired X!\u201d\nand \u201cX is bad\u201d means \u201cWould that everybody\ndesired that not-X!\u201d, and the desires expressed by these\ntwo optatives are not compossible, or at least, are only compossible\non the condition that we all have inconsistent desires (both for\nX and for not-X).\n\nBut the situation is a little different when we come to judgments\nabout what is right or what ought to be done. As we\nhave seen, Russell is inclined to give such judgments a\nconsequentialist reading and then to index them to some presumed set\nof projects. It is therefore true with respect to, say,\nRussell and myself that we ought to abolish the Death Penalty, since\nabolishing the Death Penalty is conducive to the ends that we happen\nto favor. But it is equally true with respect to some hardcore\nretributivist that we ought not to abolish the Death penalty,\nsince it is not conducive to the eye-for-an-eye ends that\nshe considers good. And this seems to be a problem. For when\nRussell and I say we ought to abolish the Death Penalty and\nthe retributivist says we that we ought not, it seems that we\nare contradicting each other. Yet if the two \u201coughts\u201d are\nindexed to different visions of the good, it seems they are quite\ncompatible. What Russell and I are saying is that abolishing the Death\nPenalty can be rationally expected to maximize the things we\nconsider good and to minimize the things that we consider\nevil. What the retributivist is saying (if she is a consequentialist)\nis that not abolishing the Death Penalty can be rationally\nexpected to maximize the things she considers good (which\ninclude retributive punishment) and to minimize the things\nshe considers evil (such as murderers not getting their just\ndeserts). And these claims can both be true. Hence Russell\u2019s theory\nbrings about a spurious appearance of semantic harmony where in fact\nthere is conflict and contradiction. His theory suggests that the\nfriends and foes of the Death Penalty are not contradicting\neach other, when in fact it is evident that they are. Genuine\ndisagreement would only be possible between those who agreed about the\nends but disagreed about the means. Thus if (in 1940) Hitler claimed\nthat the Luftwaffe ought to bomb London rather than the RAF airfields\nwhilst Goering claimed that the Luftwaffe ought to bomb the RAF\nairfields rather than bombing London, the two would be in\ncontradiction since their ends were presumably the same. But their\nviews would be quite compatible with those of a pacifist who claimed\nthat nobody ought ever to bomb anything!\n\nRussell himself had raised much the same objection against relativist\ndefinitions of \u201cgood\u201d and \u201cbad\u201d in 1912:\n\n\nIf in asserting that A is good, X meant merely to assert\nthat A had a certain relation to himself such as pleasing his\ntaste in some way [or being conducive his ends] and Y, in\nsaying that A is not good, meant merely to deny that A\nhad a like relation to himself; then there would be no subject of\ndebate between them. (Philosophical Essays:\n20\u201321/Papers 6: 222)\n\n\nBut, as Russell plainly believes, there is a subject of\ndebate between them, which means that relativistic readings of\n\u201cgood\u201d and \u201cbad\u201d must (at least sometimes) be\nwrong. A similar problem afflicts his own subsequent analyses of\n\u201cought\u201d and \u201cright\u201d. Since their\n\u201coughts\u201d are indexed to different ends, it seems that when\nthe Nazi says \u201cWe ought to bomb London\u201d and the pacifist\nsays \u201cNobody ever ought to bomb anything\u201d they are not\ncontradicting one another, though it is as clear as daylight that they\nare.\n\nRussell might reply that his suggestion is not intended as an\naccount of what \u201cright\u201d, \u201cwrong\u201d and\n\u201cought\u201d actually mean, but as proposal\nabout what they ought to mean. His theory is not intended as\na description of our current semantic slum, but as a scheme\nfor linguistic reform. It may be that at present we\ntake those whose \u201coughts\u201d are indexed to different ends to\nbe contradicting one other but Russell is hoping to change all that.\nGiven current usage, when Hitler says \u201cWe ought to bomb\nLondon\u201d and the pacifist says \u201cNobody ever ought to bomb\nanything\u201d, the two claims contradict each other, but once\nRussell\u2019s reform is has been implemented this disagreeable dispute\nwill be smoothed into non-existence.\n\nThe problem with this is that Russell\u2019s \u201cproposal\u201d is not\na very attractive one. One of the things we want to do with\nmoral language is express our disagreements. Russell\u2019s new-fangled\n\u201cought\u201d would be unable fulfill one of the most important\nlinguistic functions of the old-fashioned \u201cought\u201d, namely\nto express that fact that people with different ends disagree (as we\nwould now put it) on what ought to be done. In depriving\npeople with different ends of the means to contradict each other\nRussell would be doing them a disservice. Moreover, Russell would be\nleft with a peculiarly ramshackle meta-ethic. He would have a\ndescriptive account of what \u201cgood\u201d and \u201cbad\u201d\ndo mean and a prescriptive suggestion about the\nabout what \u201cright\u201d, \u201cwrong\u201d and\n\u201cought\u201d ought to mean. There is no actual\ninconsistency in this but it does seem to be a bit anomalous. If the\nname of the game is to analyze the moral concepts, then it\nseems Russell\u2019s analysis of \u201cright\u201d and\n\u201cought\u201d is wrong. But if the name of the game is to\nreform the moral concepts, then why not subject\n\u201cgood\u201d and \u201cbad\u201d to the same treatment, giving\nthem the kind objectivity that Russell would evidently have preferred\nthem to have?\n8.3 \u201cOught\u201d and the Open Question Argument\n\nAnother problem is that the later Russell\u2019s account of\n\u201cought\u201d-judgments runs foul of Moore\u2019s Open Question\nArgument (as his earlier self could have told him). To say that\nA ought to do X (with respect to B) is to say\nthat on the available evidence A\u2019s doing X would be most\nlikely to maximize what some contextually specified person or group\nB takes to be good and to minimize what B takes to\nbe evil. But, construed as an account of what we actually mean, this\nis obviously incorrect. As Russell himself had nearly put it thirty\nyears earlier:\n\n\nIt is held that what we ought to do is that action, among all that are\npossible, which [is likely on the available evidence] to produce the\nbest results on the whole [according to some contextually specified\nstandard of goodness]; and this is regarded as constituting a\ndefinition of ought. I hold that this is not a definition,\nbut a significant proposition \u2026 It might be proved, in the\ncourse of moral exhortation, that such and such an action [is likely\non the available evidence to] have the best results [according to some\ncontextually specified standard of goodness]; and yet the person\nexhorted might inquire why he should perform the action. The exhorter\nwould have to reply: \u201cBecause you ought to do what [is likely\nto] have the best results [according to some contextually specified\nstandard of goodness].\u201d And this reply distinctly adds\nsomething. The same arguments by which good was shown to be\nindefinable can be repeated here, mutatis mutandis, to show\nthe indefinability of ought. (RoE: 101/Papers 4:\n573, somewhat modified)\n\n\nThus Russell is making exactly the same mistake that he accused Moore\nof making in 1904!\n (See above, \u00a74).\n\nAgain Russell might reply that he is not attempting to describe how we\nactually use \u201cought\u201d but making a suggestion\nabout \u201cought\u201d should be used. But if we are to ring out\nthe old \u201cought\u201d and ring in the new, we need to be assured\nthat this would be a good idea. And that requires something rather\nmore solid in the way of a cost/benefit analysis than Russell manages\nto supply.\n8.4 The Problem of Validity\n\nIt is a common complaint against emotivism that it precludes the\npossibility of moral arguments that are valid in a non-trivial sense.\nAn argument is formally valid if and only if, no matter how the\nnon-logical vocabulary is interpreted, the premises cannot be true and\nthe conclusion false. But if the premises of a moral argument are not\ntruth-apt\u2014if they are semantically incapable of truth\nor falsity\u2014then all moral arguments, no matter how obviously\n\u201cillogical\u201d they may appear, will be trivially valid,\nsince the premises cannot be true! We can avoid this absurdity by\nmaking explicit what the standard definition of validity\npresupposes\u2014that an argument cannot be a candidate for\nvalidity unless the premises and the conclusions are both truth-apt.\nBut if we do that, moral arguments cease to be candidates for\nvalidity, no matter how logically impeccable they may appear to be.\nStevenson (1944: 154\u2013159) accepts this conclusion as a\nconsequence of his theory, but to the rest of us it seems a very large\ndead rat to swallow.\n\nRussell is immune to this argument as regards \u201cought\u201d,\n\u201cright\u201d and \u201cwrong\u201d since in his view\nought-judgments are susceptible to truth and falsity. \u201cIt is\nwrong (wrt to B) to kill the innocent\u201d is a truth-apt\nexpression. Hence the argument \u201cIt is wrong (wrt to B) to\nkill the innocent; to bomb the village would be to kill the innocent:\ntherefore it is wrong (wrt to B) to bomb the village\u201d, is\na candidate for validity, and is in fact, valid. To argue from the\nsame premises that it would be right (wrt B) to bomb\nthe village would be obviously fallacious.\n\nBut what about this argument?\n\nIt is good to contemplate whatever is beautiful;\nMichelangelo\u2019s David is beautiful;\n\n\nTherefore\n\nIt is good to contemplate Michelangelo\u2019s David.\n\n\nIsn\u2019t it obviously valid? And wouldn\u2019t it be obviously\ninvalid to conclude from the same premises that contemplating\nMichelangelo\u2019s David would be bad? Yet if arguments involving\n\u201cgood\u201d are not even candidates for validity, it appears\nthat the two arguments are on a par!\n\nThis is a telling objection against some forms of emotivism\nwhich portray moral judgments as mere expressions of raw feeling,\nanalogous to cries of ecstasy or groans of pain. But Russell is better\nplaced to meet this difficulty, since in his view judgments about what\nis ultimately good and bad are disguised optatives, designed to\nexpress desires or wishes of a certain kind. And it is possible to\nconstruct a rudimentary concept of logical consequence (and hence of\nvalidity) that applies to arguments in the optative mood. Sentences in\nthe optative have fulfillment conditions just as sentences in the\nindicative have truth-conditions. To understand an optative sentence\nis a) to understand that it is in the optative and b) to\nunderstand what the world would have to be like to satisfy the desires\nor the wishes expressed. Just as indicative validity can be defined in\nterms of truth, optative validity can be defined in terms of\nfulfillment. (It would be nice to talk of \u201csatisfaction\u201d\nrather than \u201cfulfillment\u201d here, but the word\n\u201csatisfaction\u201d has been preempted to stand for a different\nbut related notion.) An optative sentence Q is the logical\nconsequence of a set of optative sentences P and a (possibly\nempty) set of factual sentences C, if and only if, however the\nnon-logical vocabulary is interpreted, the desires expressed in\nP cannot be fulfilled under the circumstances described in\nC unless the desire expressed by Q is fulfilled too. An\noptative argument is valid if the conclusion is an optative\nconsequence of the premises; invalid otherwise. Hence there can be\nvalid (and invalid!) arguments about goodness as well as logical\nrelations between the relevant sentences. Thus our argument\nbecomes:\n\n1\u2032.\nWould that everyone desired to contemplate whatever is\nbeautiful!\n2\u2032.\nMichelangelo\u2019s David is beautiful.\n3\u2032.\nWould that everyone desired to contemplate Michelangelo\u2019s\nDavid!\n\n\nThis is not perhaps a very plausible reconstruction of the original\nargument, but it is logically valid in the sense defined. For\nthe wish expressed at premise 1\u2032) cannot be fulfilled under the\nfactual conditions specified at premise 2\u2032) without fulfilling\nthe wish expressed at the conclusion 3\u2032).\n8.5 Geach\u2019s Problem\n\nBut there is another broadly logical objection to emotivism that is\nmuch more difficult for Russell to meet. The objection was first\nmooted by W.D. Ross (1939) but it was reinvented and refined by P.T.\nGeach (1960, 1965), who modestly attributes it to Frege. Consider the\nfollowing obviously valid argument:\n\n(1)\nIt is always good to contemplate beautiful works of art.\n(2)\nIf it is always good to contemplate beautiful works of art, then\nit is good to contemplate Michelangelo\u2019s David.\n\n\nTherefore\n\n(3)\nIt is good to contemplate Michelangelo\u2019s David.\n\n\nIn this argument, the sentence \u201cIt is always good to contemplate\nbeautiful works of art\u201d, occurs twice. In (1) it occurs by\nitself as an assertion; in (2) it occurs unasserted as part of a\nlarger sentence. We know what the sentence is supposed to mean at its\nfirst occurrence\u2014despite its indicative appearance it is really\nin the optative mood and expresses a wish: \u201cWould that everyone\nalways desired to desire to contemplate beautiful works of\nart!\u201d. But what about its second occurrence where it\nappears as the antecedent to a conditional? Is it expressing that wish\nthere? Surely not. For someone can subscribe to the conditional (2)\nwhilst rejecting the relevant wish. For example, we can imagine\nsomebody reasoning like this:\n\n(1\u2032)\nIt is not good to contemplate Michelangelo\u2019s David [perhaps\nbecause it arouses unhealthy sexual appetites for strapping\nfifteen-year-olds].\n(2)\nIf it is always good to contemplate beautiful works of art, then\nit is good to contemplate Michelangelo\u2019s David.\n\n\nTherefore\n\n(3\u2032)\nIt is not always good to contemplate beautiful works of art.\n\n\nThe person who accepts this argument clearly does not wish\nthat everyone should always desire to contemplate beautiful works of\nart. But she subscribes to premise (2) nonetheless. Thus the sentence\n\u201cit is always good to contemplate beautiful works of art\u201d,\ncannot generally be construed as an optative when it occurs in an\nembedded context (that is when it occurs as a sub-sentence within a\nlarger, more complex sentence). This is already a very damaging\nobjection to Russell\u2019s theory of how \u201cgood\u201d functions,\nsince it shows that the theory is radically incomplete. Russell can\nonly account for a very restricted class of cases, namely those in\nwhich sentences of the form \u201cX is good\u201d are used by\nthemselves to make an assertion, not the numerous cases in which such\nsentences occur, unasserted, as components of larger sentences. (It\nis, so to speak, a theory of the semantic atoms that cannot account\nfor their role within semantic molecules.) But there is worse to come.\nSuppose Russell added one or more epicycles to his theory to explain\nhow \u201cX is good\u201d manages to be meaningful in\nunasserted contexts. The revised theory would have to distinguish\nbetween different uses of \u201cgood\u201d, giving one account for\nasserted contexts and a different account (or set of accounts) for the\nunasserted contexts. Thus \u201cX is good\u201d would\nsometimes be a disguised optative and sometimes something else. (Never\nmind what\u2014it does not really matter.) Now, consider the\nfollowing argument schema:\n\nX is good.\nIf X is good then Q.\n\n\nTherefore\n\nQ\n\n\nIn this argument \u201cX is good\u201d would have one meaning\nin premise (i)\u2014in which it would be an optative\u2014and\nanother in premise (ii)\u2014in which it would be a creature of some\nother semantic kind. (I have emphasized the point by putting the first\noccurrence in italics and the second in bold.) But an argument is only\nvalid if the words involved retain the same meanings throughout the\ninference. If not, we have an instance of the fallacy of equivocation.\nSo it looks as if any attempt to deal with Geach\u2019s first\nproblem by explaining how \u201cgood\u201d works in unasserted\ncontexts would have the unintended side-effect of converting obviously\nvalid arguments such as the above into instances of equivocation. Not\nonly is the theory radically incomplete\u2014if it were\ncompleted, it would reduce a huge number of obviously valid arguments\nto invalidity by construing them as equivocal.\n\nThis is, perhaps, the leading problem for non-cognitivist or\nexpressivist theories of value and a vast amount of ink has been spilt\ntrying to solve it. (See, for instance, A. Miller, 2013,\nContemporary Metaethics: an Introduction, 2nd edn:\n6, 37\u20139, 53\u201367, 68, 70\u20131, 73, 79n23, 89\u2013102,\n118, 127\u201332 & 245 and Schroeder, 2010, Non-Cognitivism\nin Ethics: chs. 3, 4 & 7.) It would take me too far afield to\ndiscuss the matter in detail. Suffice to say that Russell\u2019s theory\nfaces ship-wreck unless this problem can be solved and, in my opinion,\nthe problem is insoluble.\n8.6 Commitment and Inconsistency\n\n\nI am accused of inconsistency, perhaps justly, because, although I\nhold ultimate ethical valuations to be subjective, I nevertheless\nallow myself emphatic opinions on ethical questions.\n\n\nThus wrote Russell in reply to critics who thought that his emotivism\nprecluded him from being so relentlessly preachy. There was, they\nthought, some kind of pragmatic inconsistency between vehement moral\nopinions (frequently voiced) and meta-ethical emotivism (RoE:\n145\u2013150/Papers 11: 48\u201352). Russell makes short\nwork of this. In his view the function of the words \u201cgood\u201d\nand \u201cbad\u201d is to express certain kinds of desires. Since he\nhad the relevant desires there was no inconsistency in his\nusing \u201cgood\u201d and \u201cbad\u201d to express the desires\nthat they were designed to express. There is nothing inconsistent\nabout using a piece of verbal machinery to do what you think it is\ndesigned to do.\n\n\nI am quite at a loss to understand why any one should be surprised at\nmy expressing vehement ethical judgments. By my own theory, I am, in\ndoing so, expressing vehement desires as to the desires of mankind; I\nfeel such desires, so why not express them?\n\n\nNor (as he might have added) is there any inconsistency between\nRussell\u2019s meta-ethical emotivism and his moral and political activism.\nTo think, for example, that nuclear war would be bad is to desire that\neveryone not desire it, a desire that presumably springs from a\nfirst-order desire that there should be no such thing. In trying to\navert nuclear war, therefore, Russell was acting on a desire that for\nhim had a high priority. Which looks like an eminently rational thing\nto do.\n8.7 Russell\u2019s Feelings and the Duck Argument\n\nBut in defending himself against the charge of inconsistency, Russell\nmakes a crucial concession.\n\n\nBut what are \u201cgood\u201d desires? Are they anything more than\ndesires that you share? Certainly there seems to be something\nmore \u2026 In opposing the proposal [to introduce bull-fighting\ninto America], I should feel, not only that I was expressing\nmy desires, but that my desires in the matter are right,\nwhatever that may mean.\n\n\nWhat exactly is it that Russell feels? That those who think\nbull-fighting is good (and therefore desire it) are making some kind\nof mistake and conversely that those think that bull-fighting\nis bad (and are therefore opposed to it) are in some sense getting\nit right. Thus the \u201csomething more\u201d that Russell\ncould not help feeling was that his views about the badness of\nbullfighting were true and the views of the imaginary\nbull-fighting aficionados false. But how can that be if\n\u201cbull-fighting is bad,\u201d really is in the optative? For a\nsentence to be true or false it must be semantically capable of truth\nand falsity or, as the current jargon has it, truth-apt. Thus\nin admitting that he could not help feeling that he would be right\n(that is, correct) to oppose bull-fighting in America, Russell, was\nadmitting to feelings which suggest that his meta-ethic is false.\nMoreover the very fact that he had these feelings provides\nevidence for his theory\u2019s falsehood. Consider \u201cOh to be in\nEngland, now that April\u2019s here!\u201d, a sentence that is clearly in\nthe optative (except for the bit about April\u2019s being here). It is hard\nto see how anybody who understood this sentence could coherently feel\nor think it to be true or false. Its optative character is obvious (to\nthose who understand English) and the fact that it is in the optative\nexcludes the possibility of truth and falsehood. Since Russell\nwas inclined to feel that \u201cBull-fighting is bad\u201d\nis true, and since this is not an incoherent thing to feel or think,\nthis strongly suggests that \u201cbull-fighting is bad\u201d, unlike\n\u201cOh to be in England!\u201d, is not in the optative mood.\n\nIndeed there is something odd about the very idea of a disguised\noptative. Of course, it is possible to give orders or express wishes\nby means of sentences that are grammatically in the indicative mood.\nHenry IV\u2019s \u201cYou have good leave to leave us\u201d, is\ngrammatically in the indicative but it is merely a slightly less curt\nvariant of the obviously imperative \u201cWorcester, get thee\ngone\u201d (Shakespeare, Henry IV, 1.3). But when we use\nindicatives to express wishes or convey commands we are engaging in\ncommunicative acts which would misfire badly if the people we were\ntalking to failed to get the point. Even if King Henry had confined\nhimself to \u201cYou have good leave to leave us\u201d, omitting the\nexplicitly imperative \u201cWorcester, get thee gone\u201d,\nWorcester would have had to be singularly obtuse not to realize that\nhe was being ordered to leave. Competent speakers are usually well\naware when a grammatically indicative sentence is being used to give a\ncommand or express a desire (indeed, this is one of the\ncriteria of linguistic competence!). But it is Russell\u2019s\nhypothesis that, despite appearances, \u201cX is good\u201d\n(in the sense of good as an end) is exclusively in the optative mood\neven though, for most people, it is neither intended nor interpreted\nas such. We have been good-ing and bad-ing things up and down for\nhundreds of years whilst radically misunderstanding the meanings of\nour own utterances. To suppose this is to suppose that meaning is\nindependent of our collective intentions, which is a very large dead\nrat to swallow. Russell might reply that our usage belies our stated\nintentions, that we use \u201cX is good\u201d as if\nit were in the optative, and that despite our protestations to the\ncontrary, his theory provides the best explanation of our\nactual use. The problem with this reply is that it is based on an\nobviously false premise. We don\u2019t in fact use \u201cX is\ngood\u201d as if it were in the optative mood\u2014we treat as if it\nwere truth-apt. This brings me to the most obvious and perhaps the\nmost compelling objection to emotivism\u2014what I like to call the\nDuck Argument.\n\nThe main problem for most forms of non-cognitivism is that moral\njudgments look and behave like propositions\u2014that is, in this\nconnection, the kinds of things that can be true or false. They have,\nas the jargon has it, a \u201cpropositional surface\u201d. We claim\nthat such sentences are true or false, we speak of knowing\nthe difference between good and bad, right and wrong (where knowledge\nwould appear to entail truth), we wonder whether our ethical\nopinions are right or wrong (in the sense of correct or incorrect) and\nbelieve that we or others are, or at least may be,\nmistaken in our moral beliefs (in the sense that they may be\nfalse). All this is difficult to make sense of except on the\nassumption that moral judgments are what they appear to\nbe\u2014statements which express beliefs, describe some purported\nfacts and are therefore capable of truth and falsity. The argument\ndoes not show that there are such facts (after all, much the\nsame points could be made about theological discourse, and a set of\ntruth-apt sentences cannot conjure God into existence). It could be\nthat there are no moral facts corresponding to our opinions and thus\nthat they are predominately false, like the propositions of Greek\nmythology. But the way we talk strongly suggests that our moral\npronouncements are in the true/false game, and thus that they are\ntruth-apt or truth-valued. If something looks like a duck, swims like\na duck and quacks like a duck, then the chances are that it is indeed\na duck! Likewise, if something looks like a truth-apt\nexpression (since on the surface it is in the indicative mood), if it\nbehaves logically like a truth-apt expression (which again is\nwhat \u201cX is good\u201d undoubtedly does), if it is\ntreated by the people whose use sustains its meaning as\nif it were truth-apt, then, absent compelling arguments to the\ncontrary, it probably is truth-apt.\n8.8 Objections Concluded\n\nThus Russell\u2019s brand of emotivism is subject to devastating\nobjections, some of which he was aware of. Moreover he was not that\nkeen on it. Although he thought he could show that\n\n\nI am not guilty of any logical inconsistency in holding to [emotivism]\nand at the same time expressing strong ethical preferences \u2026 in\nfeeling I am not satisfied. (RoE: 149/Papers 11:\n51)\n\n\nIn particular, he found himself \u201cincapable of believing that all\nthat is wrong with wanton cruelty is that I don\u2019t like it\u201d. Why\nthen was he an emotivist? Because he could not \u201csee how to\nrefute the arguments for the subjectivity of ethical values\u201d\n(RoE: 165/Papers 11: 310\u2013311). What were these\narguments and why did Russell find them so compelling?\n9. Objections to Objectivism\n\n\u201cWhen I was young,\u201d writes Russell,\n\n\nI agreed with G.E. Moore in believing in the objectivity of good and\nevil. Santayana\u2019s criticism in a book called Winds of\nDoctrine, [which Russell read in 1913] caused me to abandon this\nview, though I have never been able to be as bland and comfortable\nabout it as he was. (Portraits from Memory: 91)\n\n\nAs a piece of intellectual autobiography this is not very\nilluminating. Santayana\u2019s book abounds in mellifluous sneers, but\narguments are conspicuous by their absence. Russell\u2019s reasons for\nrejecting a non-natural property of goodness have to be reconstructed\nfrom literary asides, delivered in passing in the course of his\nanti-War polemics.\n9.1 Persecution, Punishment and the Subjectivity of Value\n\nHowever, Santayana does give one reason, not for doubting the\nexistence of the Moorean Good, but for wishing that nobody believed in\nit. The idea that there are objective moral facts breeds intolerance\nand fanaticism. Accordingly, the rejection of this idea \u201cwould\ntend to render people more truly social\u201d, specifically, more\ntolerant. \u201cMoral warfare would continue\u201d, he writes,\n\u201cbut not with poisoned arrows.\u201d Russell came to agree,\nespecially after the outbreak of World War I.\n\n\nMy H[erbert] S[pencer] lecture was partly inspired by disgust at the\nuniversal outburst of righteousness in all nations since the war\nbegan. It seems the essence of virtue is persecution, and it has given\nme a disgust of all ethical notions, which evidently are chiefly\nuseful as an excuse for murder. (Letter to Samuel Alexander, 5/2/1915,\nRoE: 107/Papers 8: 56)\n\n\nThere is something rather paradoxical about this, since Russell was\nfirmly convinced of the rightness of his own anti-War activities:\n\u201cWhen the War came, I felt as if I heard the voice of God. I\nknew it was my business to protest, however futile protest might\nbe\u201d (Autobiography II: 18). If there are no objective\nmoral properties, there is no such thing as moral knowledge, which\nmeans that Russell cannot have literally known that he ought\nto protest. At best he could have known that he ought to protest\ngiven his values. But though he sometimes seems to talk as if\nit is objectively wrong to believe in objective values, Russell\u2019s\nposition is (or can be made to be) coherent. It might just be a fact\nthat moral realists tend to be more intolerant and cruel than moral\nrelativists and anti-realists. Hence those who dislike intolerance and\ncruelty have a reason for running down objectivity. As Russell himself\nput it,\n\n\nfor my part, I should wish to see in the world less cruelty,\npersecution, punishment, and moral reprobation than exists at present;\nto this end, I believe that a recognition of the subjectivity of\nethics might conduce. (RoE: 117/Papers 13: 326)\n\n\nThe word \u201crecognition\u201d suggests that the\n\u201csubjectivity of ethics\u201d is true, and thus that there is\nno such thing as a non-natural property of goodness. But setting the\nsuccess-word to one side, it might be the case that we would\nbe better off believing in the subjectivity of ethics since believing\nin objective values leads to persecution, punishment, cruelty and\nmoral reprobation. It might pay in terms of peace, love and\nunderstanding if people came to believe Russell\u2019s brand of emotivism.\nBut the fact that a belief pays, in some sense, does not make\nit true, as Russell himself was at pains to point out (see\nPhilosophical Essays, chs. iv & v). So even if we\nwould be better off believing that there were no objective\nvalues (a thesis Russell later came to doubt), this does not prove\nthat there are no such things.\n9.2 Russell and the Argument from Relativity\n\nSo what were Russell\u2019s reasons for rejecting a non-natural property of\ngoodness? One argument, subsequently popularized by J.L. Mackie (1977)\nas \u201cthe Argument from Relativity\u201d, starts with the\ndiversity of moral opinion and the supposed impossibility of proof\nwhen it comes to ultimate values.\n\n\nIf our views as to what ought to be done were to be truly rational, we\nought to have a rational way of ascertaining what things are such as\nought to exist on their own account [that is, what things are good]\n\u2026. On [this] point, no argument is possible. There can be\nnothing beyond an appeal to individual tastes. If, for example, one\nman thinks vindictive punishment desirable in itself, apart from any\nreformatory or deterrent effects, while another man thinks it\nundesirable in itself, it is impossible to bring any arguments in\nsupport of either side. (RoE: 112/Papers 13:\n186)\n\n\nNow it is, of course, a consequence of Russell\u2019s later view\nboth a) that it is impossible to have a rational argument about\n\u201cwhat things are such as ought to exist on their own\naccount\u201d and b) that in such disputes there can be nothing\nbeyond \u201can appeal to individual tastes\u201d. But though you\ncan argue from emotivism and the non-existence of objective\ngoodness to the truth of a) and b), can you argue\nfrom a) and b) to the non-existence of objective\ngoodness?\n\nThe argument, I suggest, is best construed as an inference to the best\nexplanation. The best explanation of a) that it is impossible to have\na rational argument about what is good or bad in itself and b) that in\nsuch disputes there can be nothing beyond \u201can appeal to\nindividual tastes\u201d is the hypothesis c) that there is nothing\nobjective to disagree about since there is no such thing as\ngoodness\u2014rather our opinions on these topics are somehow\ndependent on, or expressive of, our disparate desires and perhaps our\ndiverse upbringings.\n\nIs this a good argument? Not by itself, no. For it is not clear that\ntheses a) and b) represent genuine facts. And even if a) and b)\nare true and do represent genuine facts, is c) the\nbest explanation? Perhaps there is a property of goodness but it\nhappens to be a property that it is difficult to discern. Some people\nare just better at seeing what is good or bad than others. As Russell\nhimself put it in 1909 \u201cthe difficulty of discovering the truth\ndoes not prove that there is no truth to be discovered\u201d\n(Philosophical Essays: 20/Papers 6: 222).\n\nHowever, the Argument From Relativity looks a little better if we\nfollow Russell\u2019s hints and combine it with the Argument from\nExplanatory Impotence.\n9.3 Russell and Explanatory Impotence\n\nIn his polemical article \u201cNorth Staffs\u2019 Praise of War\u201d\n(1916) Russell suggests an argument which prefigures a famous argument\nof Gilbert Harman\u2019s 1977. (It is typical of Russell, incidentally,\nthat he develops his meta-ethical position in the course of a\nnewspaper controversy about the rights and wrongs of World War I\nrather than in an article in an academic journal.)\n\n\nI have been led to [the view that all ethics is subjective] by a\nnumber of reasons, some logical, some derived from observation.\nOccam\u2019s Razor \u2026 leads me to discard the notion of absolute good\nif ethics can be accounted for without it. Observation of ethical\nvaluations leads me to think that all ethical valuations can be so\naccounted for, and that the claim of universality which men associate\nwith their ethical judgments embodies merely the impulse to\npersecution or tyranny. (RoE: 117/Papers 13:\n325\u20136)\n\n\nThe idea seems to be that our moral evaluations\u2014our beliefs\nabout what is good or bad, wrong or right\u2014can be explained\nwithout supposing that they correspond to facts involving Moorean\nproperties of \u201cabsolute\u201d goodness or badness. And since\nour evaluations can be accounted for without supposing that there are\nany such properties, and since the only reason for we believing in\nthem is the evidence of our evaluations, we have no reason to suppose\nthat such properties exist, and some reasons (of an Occamist sort) for\nsupposing that they do not.\n\nAs it stands, this argument is inconclusive. For a Moorean might\nsimply hang tough, insisting that his own views about goodness are\nbest explained by close encounters of the Platonic kind, involving an\nintimate acquaintance with both goodness itself and the properties on\nwhich it supervenes. Of course, it is difficult to make naturalistic\nsense of such cognitions, but it is difficult to make naturalistic\nsense of our knowledge of logic, mathematics and modality. This is the\n\u201ccompanions in guilt\u201d strategy that is often deployed in\narguing for moral objectivity (for more on which, see Lillehammer\n2007). However the Argument from Explanatory Impotence gets a little\nstronger if we combine it with the Argument from Relativity. For the\nfact is that people often disagree about what is intrinsically good or\nbad, about how good or bad the good things and the bad things\nreally are, and about the relations between goodness and\nbadness and what we ought to do. We have already seen that Russell\ndisagreed with Moore about whether we ought to do that action that\nwill actually bring about the best consequences or the action\nthat it is reasonable to believe will bring about the best\nconsequences, which means that they had different intuitions about the\nrelations between goodness and obligation. Moore disagreed with\nSidgwick about whether anything besides pleasure is good as an\nend:\n\n\nThis proposition that \u201cpleasure alone is good as an end,\u201d\nthe fundamental proposition of Ethical Hedonism [is] in Professor\nSidgwick\u2019s language, \u2026 an object of intuition. I shall try to\nshew you why my intuition denies it, just as his intuition affirms it.\nIt may always be true notwithstanding; neither intuition can\nprove whether it is true or not; I am bound to be satisfied,\nif I can \u201cpresent considerations capable of determining the\nintellect\u201d to reject it. (PE: \u00a745)\n\n\nMore comically, the Cambridge Apostles seem to have had a serious\ndisagreement in 1899 about whether \u201cself-abuse\u201d was bad in\nitself, Moore intuiting that it was and his opponents arguing that it\nwas not (Levy 1981: 207\u20138). Now, how could Moore explain the\nintuitions of his opponents? Not by an encounter with badness, since\nanybody fully acquainted with badness and its relata would\nhave been forced to admit that self-abuse was bad. The non-natural\nfacts being impotent in this particular, he would have been driven\nback on natural causes (such as a taste for self-abuse) to explain the\nmisperceptions of his degenerate opponents. Thus he would have been\nforced to admit that some moral evaluations could be\nexplained without the aid of non-natural properties. But once this is\nadmitted, a \u201cWhy stop there?\u201d problem opens up. For after\nall, it would have been child\u2019s play for his opponents to return the\ncompliment, Moore\u2019s self-denying intuitions being the obvious products\nof a Puritanical upbringing. Once we admit that some moral\nintuitions can be explained by natural, as opposed to non-natural,\ncauses\u2014which seems pretty obvious given the prevalence of moral\n\u201cerror\u201d\u2014it is hard to hold the line and insist that\nthere are any of them that cannot be accounted for by\ntemperament, upbringing, desire and taste. It is possible, of\ncourse, that some moral evaluations are due to natural, and some to\nnon-natural, causes, but given that everybody admits that\nmany of our intuitions can be given a naturalistic\nexplanation (namely, the mistaken ones), Occam\u2019s razor suggests that\nthere is no need for the non-natural to explain those moral intuitions\nthat we regard as correct. When supplemented by Relativity (which is\nwhat Russell seems to be hinting at) Explanatory Impotence provides a\npowerful argument against non-natural properties.\n9.4 Emotivism or the Error Theory?\n\nThus Russell\u2019s explicit arguments for the \u201csubjectivity of\nvalue\u201d are objections to objectivism rather than arguments for a\nrival hypothesis. Moore\u2019s theory is wrong since it presupposes\nnon-existent non-natural properties of goodness and badness. But if\nnaturalism is not an option, that still leaves two\nalternatives\u2014some kind of non-cognitivism or an error-theory\n (see \u00a71).\n Russell\u2019s dominant view was to be a form of emotivism, and hence of\nnon-cognitivism. But although emotivism was Russell\u2019s dominant view\nfrom 1913 onwards, there were two significant wobbles. In 1922 he\nproposed a version of the error theory, anticipating J. L. Mackie by\nover twenty years. And in 1954 in Human Society in Ethics and\nPolitics, he endeavored to inject a little objectivity into\nethics by developing a form of naturalism. The first wobble is more\ninteresting than the second, but neither should be neglected in an\naccount of Russell\u2019s ethics, even though Russell abandoned the theory\nof HSEP within weeks of publication, reverting to the\nemotivism of 1935.\n10. Russell\u2019s Error-Theoretic Wobble: There Is No Absolute Good\n\n\u201cIs There an Absolute Good?\u201d was apparently delivered on\nthe 14th of March 1922 at special meeting of the Apostles\n(RoE: 122\u2013124/Papers 9: 345\u2013346).\nRussell opens up in the fine, flippant style that the Apostles tended\nto admire:\n\n\nWhen the generation to which I belong were young, Moore persuaded us\nall that there is an absolute good. Most of us drew the inference that\nwe were absolutely good, but this is not an essential part of\nMoore\u2019s position, though it is one of its most attractive parts.\n\n\nBut he soon gets down to philosophical business in what must be one of\nthe pithiest meta-ethical papers on record (it is a mere 809 words\nlong). Moore is right, he says, in thinking that \u201cwhen we say a\nthing is good we do not merely mean that we have towards it a\ncertain feeling, of liking or approval or what not.\u201d Indeed\n\u201cethical judgments claim objectivity\u201d; that is, they\npurport to tell it like it is. However, this \u201cclaim [to]\nobjectivity \u2026 makes them all false\u201d. Since there is no\nproperty of goodness corresponding to the linguistic predicate\n\u201cgood\u201d, nothing can ever possess it. Hence, any claim that\nfriendship or anything else is good will be false, since\nthere is no such thing as goodness for friendship or pleasure to be.\nThe same goes for badness. Moreover, if there is no such thing as\ngoodness or badness, there is no such thing as rightness either, since\nfor an action to be genuinely right it must be such that it can\nreasonably be expected to produce more good and less bad than any\nalternative. But if there is no such thing as goodness to be produced,\nno action can be expected to produce more of it than any other. Of\ncourse, an action can still be relatively right: more likely\nto produce more of what somebody believes to be good and less\nof what somebody believes to be bad than any alternative. But\nno action can be genuinely right or genuinely\nobligatory, since there are no such properties as goodness or badness\nfor conscientious agents to maximize or minimize.\n\nThus far this is very like the error theory of J.L. Mackie (Mackie\n1946, 1977: ch. 1 and Joyce 2001). But there is a twist. For Mackie,\nas for Russell, \u201cgood\u201d is a meaningful predicate even\nthough there is no property corresponding to the word. But Mackie,\nunlike Russell, is unfazed by this fact. So far as Mackie is\nconcerned, meaningful predicates that refer to non-existent properties\npose no particular problems. But for Russell, we can only talk\nmeaningfully about non-existent things if they are defined in\nterms of things with which we are acquainted. This is a consequence of\nhis Fundamental Principle that\n\n\nevery proposition that we can understand must be composed wholly of\nconstituents with which we are acquainted (Mysticism and\nLogic: 209/Papers 6: 154)\n\n\nor, as he was later to put it,\n\n\nthat sentences we can understand must be composed of words with whose\nmeaning we are acquainted. (Schilpp (ed.) 1944: 692/Papers\n11: 27)\n\n\nAccording to Russell, it\n\n\nseems natural to infer, as Moore did, that, since propositions in\nwhich the word \u201cgood\u201d occurs have meaning, the word\n\u201cgood\u201d [itself] has [a] meaning.\n\n\nThis, however, is a \u201cfallacy\u201d. Even though\n\u201cgood\u201d can appear in meaningful sentences it does not have\na meaning of its own. This is very puzzling. What does Russell mean\nwhen he says that \u201cgood\u201d has no meaning? And why is\nMoore\u2019s view dependent on the thesis that it does?\n\nLet us start with Moore. As stated above\n (\u00a72.1),\n Moore\u2019s Open Question Argument goes like this:\n\n\u201cAre X things good?\u201d is a significant or open\nquestion for any naturalistic or metaphysical predicate\n\u201cX\u201d; (whether simple or complex).\nIf two expressions (whether simple or complex) are synonymous this\nis evident on reflection to every competent speaker.\nThe meaning of a predicate or property word is the property for\nwhich it stands. Thus if two predicates or property words have\ndistinct meanings they name distinct properties.\n\n\nFrom (1) and (2) it follows that\n\n\u201cGood\u201d is not synonymous with any naturalistic or\nmetaphysical predicate \u201cX\u201d (or\n\u201cgoodness\u201d with any corresponding noun or noun-phrase\n\u201cX-ness\u201d).\n\n\nFrom (3) and (4) it follows that\n\nGoodness is not identical with any natural or metaphysical\nproperty of X-ness.\n\n\nPremise (3) is crucial. Moore takes it for granted that the meaning of\na predicate is the property for which it stands. Hence, if there were\nno property of goodness corresponding to the word \u201cgood\u201d,\n\u201cgood\u201d would be meaningless. Since \u201cgood\u201d is\nquite obviously not meaningless, the corresponding property\nis guaranteed. Thus we move from an obvious semantic fact\u2014that\n\u201cgood\u201d is plainly meaningful\u2014to a much more\ncontentious metaphysical claim\u2014that there is a corresponding\nproperty of goodness. What greases the wheels of this transition is\nthe apparently innocuous assumption that if a word like\n\u201cgood\u201d is to mean something, there must be some\nthing (or at least some property) that it means. If this\ndoctrine were true, then the objections to objectivism discussed in\nthe last section would fall to the ground. The very fact that we can\ntalk meaningfully about goodness would show that there must\nindeed be such a property. It might be causally impotent and\nmetaphysically queer, but the fact that we can discuss it would entail\nthat we were stuck with it anyway.\n\nTo the end of his days Russell believed that\n\n\nthere are words which are only significant because there is something\nthat they mean, and if there were not this something, they would be\nempty noises not words. (Russell 1959: 177)\n\n\nBut when he was young he thought that most words were like\nthis, which explains the swollen ontology of The Principles of\nMathematics:\n\n\nHomeric gods, relations, chimeras and four-dimensional spaces all have\nbeing, for if they were not entities of a kind, we could make no\npropositions about them. (Russell, The Principles of\nMathematics: 449)\n\n\nThe breakthrough came with his Theory of Definite Descriptions (1905).\nPhrases such as \u201cthe present King of France\u201d are\nincomplete symbols, which can function meaningfully in the\ncontext of a sentence even though there may be nothing that they mean.\nThey are incomplete because they have no meaning when taken in\nisolation and in the context of a sentence can be analyzed away. When\n\u201cthe King of France is bald\u201d is analyzed in accordance\nwith Russell\u2019s formula\u2014\u201cThere is something which is King\nof France such that if anything is King of France, it is identical\nwith that thing, and that thing is bald\u201d\u2014the phrase\n\u201cthe King of France\u201d simply disappears, though we are left\nwith the predicate \u201cis King of France\u201d. \u201cThe King of\nFrance is bald\u201d, is false because there is no King of\nFrance\u2014nothing which satisfies the propositional function\nbeing king of France\u2014and there is no need to suppose\nthat the King of France must have some kind of being in order for this\nproposition to make sense.\n\nThis brings us back to the Open Question Argument. So far as I can\nsee, Russell continued to accept premises (1) and (2) and\nthus\u2014with reservations\u2014sub-conclusion (4).\n\u201cGood\u201d does not mean that same as any naturalistic\npredicate X\u2014at least, it does not mean the same as any of\nthe naturalistic predicates that have been suggested so far. But he\nalso accepts something like premise (3), that the meaning of a\npredicate is the property for which it stands. It was because he\nbelieved that some predicates were among the words \u201cwhich are\nonly significant because there is something that they mean\u201d, and\nwhich would be \u201cempty noises not words\u201d in the absence of\nthis something, that he continued to believe in properties, right up\nuntil 1959. How then can Russell fend off Moore\u2019s conclusion (5) that\nthere is a property of goodness that is not identical to any\nnaturalistic property of X-ness? By modifying premise (3):\n\n3\u2032.\nThe meaning of a predicate or property word is the property for\nwhich it stands, so long as that predicate is a complete\nsymbol.\n\n\nSome predicates are not complete symbols, and these can\nfunction meaningfully in the absence of the properties that they might\ndenote. One of these predicates is the word \u201cgood\u201d.\n\n\nWithout the theory of incomplete symbols, it seemed natural to infer,\nas Moore did, that, since propositions in which the word\n\u201cgood\u201d occurs have meaning, therefore the word\n\u201cgood\u201d has meaning [or as we might now say, a referent];\nbut this was a fallacy.\n\nMy point is that the word \u201cgood\u201d does not stand for a\npredicate [by which Russell means a property] at all, but has a\nmeaning only in the sense in which descriptive phrases have meaning,\ni.e., in use, not in isolation.\n\n\nThus \u201cgood\u201d can be meaningful in the absence of a property\nof goodness and the error theory is safe from semantic refutation.\n\nBut Russell is not quite out of the woods. He continued to believe in\nhis Fundamental Principle that to understand a proposition we must be\nacquainted with the referents of the words that remain once the\nproposition has been boiled down to its ultimate constituents. This\nmeans, in effect, that things which don\u2019t exist have to be defined in\nterms of things which do, indeed, that things which don\u2019t\nexist have to be defined terms of things (including universals) with\nwhich we are acquainted. How then is \u201cgood\u201d to be\ndefined? More pedantically, how are sentences involving\n\u201cgood\u201d to be analyzed so that the word \u201cgood\u201d\ncan be eliminated? According to Russell,\n\n\nwhen we judge \u201cM is good\u201d, we mean: \u201cM\nhas that predicate [property] which is common to A, B,\nC, \u2026[the things we approve of] but is absent in\nX, Y, Z, \u2026[the things we disapprove\nof].\u201d\n\n\nThe emotions of approval and disapproval, Russell notes,\n\n\ndo not enter into the meaning of the proposition \u201cM is\ngood\u201d, but only into its genesis.\n\n\nThat is, \u201cgood\u201d is defined in terms of the things that we\napprove (and disapprove) of, even though the fact that we approve (or\ndisapprove) of them is not incorporated into the analysis. Now, in\nRussell\u2019s opinion, the proposition\n\n\nM has that property which is common to A, B,\nC, \u2026 [the things we approve of] but is absent in\nX, Y, Z, \u2026 [the things we disapprove\nof],\n\n\nwill be always be false since the things we approve of have nothing in\ncommon apart from the fact that we approve of them. That is why\n\u201call propositions in which the word \u2018good\u2019\nhas a primary occurrence are false.\u201d But will such propositions\nin fact be false? Surely X, Y, Z,\netc. do have a property in common, namely the property\nof being X or Y or Z or \u2026! Perhaps Russell would reply\nthat disjunctive properties are not real properties. He took a dim\nview of disjunctive facts in\nThe Philosophy of Logical Atomism, and if disjunctive\nfacts should be rejected, then disjunctive properties would\nappear to be equally suspect (Papers 8: 185\u20136/The\nPhilosophy of Logical Atomism: 71\u201372). Even so, we cannot\nbe sure that in every case the things that we approve of\ndon\u2019t have something in common other than a) the fact that we approve\nof them and b) that they satisfy a disjunctive predicate. Nor is this\nthe only problem. Though Russell defines \u201cgood\u201d in terms\nof the things that \u201cwe\u201d approve (and disapprove)\nof, what he seems to mean is that each person defines\n\u201cgood\u201d in terms of the things that he or she\napproves (or disapproves) of. Thus if you and I approve of different\nthings, when I say \u201cM is good\u201d and you say\n\u201cM is not good\u201d what I mean is that M has\nthe property shared by X, Y, Z \u2026\n[the things that I approve of] whereas what you mean\nis that is that it does not have the property shared by\nA, B, C \u2026 [the things that\nyou approve of]. But in that case the Problem of the\nDisappearing Dispute rears its ugly head. On Russell\u2019s theory my\n\u201cM is good\u201d and your \u201cM is not\ngood\u201d may be quite consistent. But since they are obviously\nnot consistent, there must be something wrong with Russell\u2019s\ntheory. We can put the point by paraphrasing Russell\u2019s own criticisms\nof simple subjectivism:\n\n\nIf in asserting that A is good, [a person] X meant\nmerely to assert that A had a certain relation to himself such\nas pleasing his taste in some way [or that A had a\ncharacteristic shared by the things of which he approved] and\nY, in saying that A is not good, meant merely to deny\nthat A had a like relation to himself [or to deny that A\nhad the characteristic shared by the things of which he, Y,\napproved]; then there would be no subject of debate between them.\n(Philosophical Essays: 20\u201321/Papers 6:\n222)\n\n\nNor is this all. As we saw in\n \u00a78.1,\n our moral sentiments are partly constituted by our moral beliefs.\nWhat distinguishes approval from a warm feeling of liking is not some\ndifference in phenomenological flavor but the thought that the thing\nwe approve of is good or right. Our moral sentiments are feelings\nthat, where what follows the \u201cthat\u201d is a moral\njudgment. But if we can\u2019t have feelings of approval or disapproval\nwithout the corresponding moral beliefs, we can\u2019t explain the\nintellectual origins of the common conceptions of goodness and badness\nin terms of pre-existing sentiments of approval or disapproval. For\nprior to these conceptions there were no such sentiments. This is not\nthe criticism that sank the emotivist theories of Ayer and Stevenson.\nThe problem is not that Russell\u2019s analysis of\n\u201cgood\u201d is viciously circular because it presupposes the\nvery concept that it purports to explicate. The problem is\nthat his genealogy of \u201cgood\u201d is viciously\ncircular (and therefore false) since it presupposes the concept it\npurports to explain. For in his capacity as an error-theorist\nRussell does not define \u201cgood\u201d and\n\u201cbad\u201d in terms of approval and disapproval. Rather he\ngives a genealogy of these notions in which the feelings of\napproval and disapproval play a crucial part. As he himself puts it:\n\u201cthe emotions of approval and disapproval do not enter into the\nmeaning of the proposition \u2018M is good\u2019, but only\ninto its genesis\u201d. But our concepts of \u201cgood\u201d and\n\u201cbad\u201d cannot be caused by prior feelings of approval and\ndisapproval if those feelings are partly constituted by the very\nbeliefs they are supposed to cause. My belief that M is good\ncannot be caused by tendency to approve of M, if I cannot\napprove of M without believing that M is good.\n\nHowever, the real difficulty with Russell\u2019s error theory and the one\nwhich probably weighed with Russell himself, seems to be this. Given\nRussell\u2019s theory of meaning, he can make sense of non-existent\nproperties but not non-natural predicates. At least, he cannot make\nsense of predicates that are not definable in terms of things with\nwhich we are acquainted. Thus on the assumption that we are not\nacquainted with goodness (which we obviously cannot be if there is\nreally no such thing), and on the assumption that \u201cgood\u201d\ncannot defined in terms of the things with which we are\nacquainted (which seems pretty plausible if is not equivalent to any\nnaturalistic predicate) then we cannot even understand the\npredicate \u201cgood\u201d. At least, we cannot understand it, if it\nis construed as a descriptive predicate whose function it is to denote\na property (whether real or non-existent).\n\nAfter 1922, Russell abandoned the error theory and reverted to the\nemotivism that he had been flirting with since 1913. His reasons\nremain obscure. But perhaps it had something to do with the fact that\nhis Fundamental Principle, when combined with the OQA, made it\ndifficult, if not impossible, to make sense of \u201cgood\u201d as\nstanding for a property that is both non-existent\nand non-natural. Since he retained his faith in the\nFundamental Principle he had to give up the error theory. And since he\nhad already rejected the objectivity of ethics\u2014what we would\nnowadays describe as moral realism\u2014this left him no alternative\nbut some form of non-cognitivsm. In my opinion this was the wrong\nchoice. He would have done better to give up the Fundamental Principle\nand stick with the error theory. But perhaps the thesis that moral\njudgments are mostly false was a bit too much for a dedicated moralist\nsuch as he. As he wrote to his brother, he would rather \u201cbe mad\nwith truth than sane with lies\u201d and the idea that morality was\nlargely composed of lies\u2014or a best useful fictions\u2014would\nhave been too much to bear (see Pigden (ed.) 1999: 20, 121\u2013122,\n& 189\u2013193).\n11. Russell\u2019s Humean Wobble: Human Society in Ethics and Politics\n\nRussell\u2019s Human Society is a fun book to read, but\nmeta-ethically it is a bit of a mess. There is much wit and some\nwisdom, though both the wit and the wisdom are more conspicuous when\nhe is discussing human nature and human society than when he is\ndiscussing the finer points of ethical theory. (I particularly like\nhis frequent complaints that human behavior seldom rises to the level\nof enlightened self-interest. If only we could manage to be\nintelligently selfish, the world would be a much better place.) The\ndrift of the argument is sometimes difficult to discern, partly\nbecause of has frequent digressions to make bon mots, and\npartly because of his dialectical method of presentation, which\napproaches what he takes to be the truth via a series of successive\napproximations. Human Society in Ethics and Politics was\npublished in 1954, but the meta-ethical bits were originally written\nsome years earlier and intended for inclusion in Human Knowledge:\nIts Scope and Limits (1948). Russell held them back because he\nwas not sure whether ethical propositions rose to the dignity of\nknowledge. He continued to be doubtful about this, but by the early\n1950s his doubts had sufficiently dissipated for publication to become\na possibility. Nevertheless, there are marked analogies between the\ntwo books. Human Knowledge attempts to establish the\nexistence of a mind-independent world on the basis of private\nperceptions. Human Society attempts to establish an ethic\nthat is in some degree independent of individual minds on the\nbasis of subjective sentiments.\n\nHume looms large in Russell\u2019s Human Knowledge. Indeed the\nwhole book can be seen as an attempt to concede the premises of Hume\u2019s\nskeptical argument\u2014that the data we start with are private and\npersonal and that we cannot infer an external world from such data by\nmeans of demonstrative inference\u2014whilst resisting its\nconclusion\u2014that we can have no knowledge of an external world.\n(Hence the need for non-demonstrative inference.) But although Hume\nwas Russell\u2019s chief opponent in Human Knowledge, he was\nperhaps a meta-ethical ally in Human Society. In the\nEnquiry Concerning the Principles of Moral, Hume sought to\nbase an inter-subjective ethic on human sentiments, specifically the\nsentiments of approbation and disapprobation. Hume was much more at\nease in the world than Russell, and was only interested in moral\nreform in so far as morals rested on the \u201cdelusive glosses of\nsuperstition and false religion\u201d (which in his opinion included\nall religion) or the ideological delusions of factious\npoliticians and mercantile economists. But he did want a meta-ethic\nthat would enable him to transfer the monkish virtues (whose status\nas virtues depended on the \u201cdelusive glosses\u201d)\nfrom the catalogue of virtues to the catalogue of vices. Thus he\nwanted to be able to show that those who approved of \u201ccelibacy,\nfasting, penance, mortification, self-denial, humility, silence,\nsolitude\u201d were making some kind of mistake. How did he\npropose to do this? By combining a definition with an empirical\nresearch program.\n\n\nThe hypothesis which we embrace is plain. It maintains that morality\nis determined by sentiment. It defines [my italics] virtue to\nbe whatever mental action or quality gives to a spectator the\npleasing sentiment of approbation; and vice the contrary. We then\nproceed to examine a plain matter of fact, to wit, what actions have\nthis influence. (Hume 1975 [1748]: 289)\n\n\nThe matter of fact is less plain than Hume suggests, since the\n\u201cspectator\u201d is an idealized observer, whose moral\nsense operates at optimum in part because (unlike the rest of us) he\nis relevantly informed. This means that we cannot simply predict the\nreactions of the spectator by observing the reactions of mankind,\nsince mankind is sometimes mistaken about the relevant facts. In\nparticular, since many people are subject to the delusive glosses of\nsuperstition and false religion, their reactions are liable to be\ndistorted by false beliefs, leading them to approve of what is really\nvicious (such as celibacy, fasting etc) and to disapprove of what is\nreally right (such as playing whist on Sundays with \u201cmodest\nwomen\u201d). Since a virtue is whatever mental action or quality\ngives to a [suitably qualified] spectator the pleasing\nsentiment of approbation, and since nobody would approve of\nfasting, celibacy etc if they did not think they would be\nuseful in procuring an agreeable afterlife, no\nsuitably qualified person would approve of them, since being suitably\nqualified involves not being subject to the delusive glosses\nof superstition and false religion. However Hume\u2019s meta-ethic rests\npartly on a definition (which Hume obviously conceives of as\nreporting a truth of language) and partly on the thesis that people\nshare the same moral sensibility which can therefore be\n\u201cidealized\u201d to serve as the criterion for virtue. In other\nwords Hume\u2019s theory rests on the presupposition that, given the same\ninformation, we would approve or disapprove of much the same\nthings.\n\nWhat about Russell? His theory, like Hume\u2019s rests on a set of\n\u201cfundamental propositions and definitions\u201d:\n\nSurveying the acts which arouse emotions of approval or\ndisapproval, we find that, as a general rule, the acts which are\napproved of are those believed likely to have, on the balance, effects\nof certain kinds, while opposite effects are expected from acts that\nare disapproved of.\nEffects that lead to approval are defined as \u201cgood\u201d,\nand those leading to disapproval as \u201cbad\u201d.\nAn act of which, on the available evidence, the effects are likely\nto be better than those of any other act that is possible in the\ncircumstances, is defined as \u201cright\u201d; any other act is\n\u201cwrong\u201d. What we \u201cought\u201d to do is, by\ndefinition, the act which is right.\n\n\n\nThese definitions and propositions, if accepted provide a coherent\nbody of propositions which are true (or false) in the same sense as if\nthey were propositions of science. (RoE:\n161\u2013162/Human Society in Ethics and Politics: 116)\n\n\nNow (1) is a variant of Sidgwick\u2019s thesis that common-sense moralities\ntend to solidify around rules which are believed to have generally\nbeneficial consequences, where the benefit is cashed out in terms of\nhuman welfare. It is a dubious thesis, especially as Russell himself\nhad argued that many traditional moralities foster the interests of\nthe elite at the expense of other groups\u2014foreigners, women,\nslaves and serfs. Perhaps Russell wants to exclude such moralities, by\nrestricting his claim to civilized communities, where\n\u201ccivilized\u201d rules out societies with blatantly elitist\nmoral codes. Thesis (2) purports to define \u201cgood effects\u201d,\nbut it does not state whose approval is to determine\ngoodness\u2014people in general, people at their impartial best, or\njust the enlightened and well-informed? Without some clarity on this\npoint, too many things will wind up as good, since for any likely\neffect there will be some weirdo somewhere who approves of it.\nConversely, if being disapproved of means that an effect is\nnot good, the class of good effects may vanish altogether,\nsince for any likely effect there will be some weirdo somewhere who\ndisapproves of it. Paradoxically given his long career as a\nmoral radical, Russell\u2019s meta-ethic seems to have less critical bite\nthan Hume\u2019s, at least as regards ends. Hume\u2019s theory allows him to\ntransfer a reputed virtue to the catalogue of vices if people approve\nof it on the basis of false beliefs. Russell seems to be stuck with\nwhatever effects people happen to approve of even if their tendency to\napprove is based on false beliefs and malodorous passions. But the\nreal problem lies with (3). It defines \u201cright\u201d and\n\u201cought\u201d in consequentialist terms and as we have seen (and\nas Russell himself had argued many years before) such a definition is\nclearly false, at least if it is construed as a report of current\nusage. It is not a tautology to say that the right thing to do is the\naction that seems likely to produce the best consequences, which it\nwould be if Russell\u2019s definition were correct.\n\nThe theory could be improved by retaining (1) and (2) with the class\nof approvers more carefully specified, but replacing (3) with\nsomething like:\n\n3a.\nThe right thing to do is defined as the action which an impartial,\ninformed and non-superstitious spectator would approve of doing.\n\n\nOn the assumption that the impartial spectator would retain the\nbroadly consequentialist tendencies of our rude ancestors, (1) and\n(3a) together would allow us to derive:\n\n3b.\nThe right thing to do is that action which seems likely to produce\nthe best effects.\n\n\nAnd this would be a moderately plausible synthetic claim rather than a\npatently false definition. Moreover, it would provide the basis for\nthe right kind of utilitarian ethic\u2014at least, it would do so if\nthe ethical jury in (2) is specified in such a way as to ensure that\nthey approve of the right effects.\n\nBut so far from being \u201ctrue in the same sense as if they were\npropositions of science\u201d, the definitions (2) and (3a) are\nsimply false, at least if they are construed as accounts of what the\nwords in question actually mean. Russell seems to have been aware of\nthis, as the tell-tale phrase \u201cif they are accepted\u201d\nindicates. Perhaps these definitions should be understood not as\nattempts to codify current usage but as proposals for linguistic\nreform (which, was a common dodge on the part of mid-century\nphilosophers when their purported analyses proved false). But in that\ncase they can be rejected without making any kind of mistake, along\nwith Russell\u2019s entire ethic. And what can be rejected without\nintellectual error can hardly qualify as knowledge.\n\nRussell himself may have agreed. He was not at all sure that there\nwas such a thing as ethical knowledge and soon reverted to\nhis earlier emotivism. Within one month of the publication of\nHuman Society he was expressing \u201ccomplete\nagreement\u201d with the emotivism of A.J. Ayer (RoE:\n165/Papers 11: 175). The reason, I suspect, is that he came\nto see that his definitions of \u2018right\u2019 and\n\u2018good\u2019 were intellectually optional. Some years later a Mr\nHarold Osborn sent him a book which attempted to provide an objective\nbasis for a humanistic ethic. Russell\u2019s letter of thanks points out a\nproblem: \u201cany system of ethics which claims objectivity can only\ndo so by means of a concealed ethical premise, which, if disputed,\ncannot be demonstrated\u201d (Dear Bertrand Russell: 98).\nThat is precisely what is wrong with Human Society in Ethics and\nPolitics.\n12. Conclusion\n\nWe started out with Russell\u2019s adverse verdict on his own meta-ethics:\n\u201cI am not, myself, satisfied with what I have read or said on\nthe philosophical basis of ethics\u201d (RoE:\n165/Papers 11: 310\u201311). And we can see in a sense that\nhe was right. Every meta-ethic that he developed seems to be subject\nto insuperable, objections. But although Russell\u2019s writings on ethics\nare unsatisfactory, this does not mean that they are worthless.\nMeta-ethics is a difficult subject and it is hard to get it right. And\nif we ever are to get it right, we must learn from those,\nlike Russell, who got it interestingly and instructively wrong. In the\ncourse of his long philosophical career, Russell canvassed most of the\nmeta-ethical options that have dominated debate in the Twentieth and\nTwenty-First Centuries\u2014naturalism, non-naturalism, emotivism and\nthe error-theory, and even, to some extent, subjectivism and\nrelativism. And though none of his theories quite worked out, there is\nmuch to be learned from his mistakes. Nor is this all. His\narguments as well as his theories are often\ninteresting and instructive. As we have seen, the ethical corollary to\nthe argument of \u201cSeems Madam? Nay, It Is,\u201d puts the kybosh\non any attempt to resolve Sidgwick\u2019s Dualism of Practical Reason by\narguing that although we are distinct beings with different interests\nin the world of Appearance, we are, in Reality, all one\n (\u00a73).\n Russell\u2019s arguments against objectivism are often quite powerful, and\none anticipates Gilbert Harman\u2019s, influential argument that objective\nvalues can be safely dismissed since they lack explanatory power\n (\u00a79.3\u20139.4).\n Russell\u2019s damning critique of Moore\u2019s analytic consequentialism led\nMoore to abandon the view and perhaps to give up his \u201cunduly\nanti-reforming\u201d moral conservatism. Moreover Russell\u2019s\nindirect influence on meta-ethics may have been profound\nsince the Open Question Argument, was probably invented to deal with\nRussell\u2019s ideas. Finally, in the realm of normative ethics, Russell\ndeveloped a sensible and humane version of consequentialism, which\n(despite its shaky meta-ethical foundations) is resistant, if not\nimmune, to many of the standard criticisms, especially if\ncombined\u2014as Russell thought it should be combined\u2014with a\nhealthy dose of political skepticism. It provides a powerful tool for\nsocial and political criticism, a tool which Russell vigorously\nemployed on a vast range of topics in his writings on practical\nethics.\n\nIndeed, I should emphasize that, lengthy as this entry is, I have said\nvirtually nothing about the vast bulk of Russell\u2019s writings on moral\nand political topics. If we are to judge by his literary output,\nRussell was much more interested in social and political questions and\nthe rights and wrongs of war and peace than in abstract questions of\nethical theory. But, when it comes to Russell\u2019s popular writings,\nthere is no need for an intermediary. His books are easy to get hold\nof, easy to read, often very funny, and, despite the now dated\nallusions, easy to understand. Read them yourself and make up your own\nmind.",
