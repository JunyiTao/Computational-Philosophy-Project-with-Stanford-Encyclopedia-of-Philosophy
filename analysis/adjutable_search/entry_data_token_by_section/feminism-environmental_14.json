    "main_text": "Second Kind of Position in Feminist Environmental Philosophy: Ecofeminist Philosophy || Epistemological Perspectives\n3.6 Epistemological Perspectives\nEcofeminist epistemology extends feminist epistemology's concerns\nwith ways that gender influences conceptions of knowledge, the knower,\nand methods of inquiry and justification (see the entry on \n feminist epistemology and philosophy of science).\n It does so by showing how these concerns involve women-nature\n connections.\n\n\nConsider an example often discussed by ecofeminist philosophers. In 1974,\ntwenty-seven women of Reni in northern India took simple but effective\naction to stop tree felling of indigenous forests. They threatened to\nhug the trees if the lumberjacks attempted to cut them down. The\nwomen's protest, known as \u201cthe Chipko Movement\u201d\n(\u201cchipko\u201d in Hindi means \u201cto embrace\u201d or\n\u201chug\u201d), saved 12,000 square kilometers of sensitive\nwatershed. The Chipko movement also gave visibility to two main\ncomplaints of local people: commercial felling by contractors damages\na wide variety of species of trees, and it replaces valuable,\nmultispecies indigenous forests with monoculture plantations of teak\nand eucalyptus.  This commercial felling also disproportionately\nharmed women by: increasing the amount of time women spent collecting\nfirewood; reducing women's abilities to maintain household economies\nthat are dependent upon trees for food, fuel, fodder, and products for\nthe home; and, decreasing opportunities for women to make\nincome-generating wood products for sale at local markets (Louise\nFortmann and Diane Rocheleau 1985; Fortmann and John Bruce 1991).\nThe Chipko movement shows that often it is rural women (such as the\nChipko women), not the \u201coutside\u201d Western-trained forester,\nwho are the experts (\u201cthe knowers\u201d) on how to use\nindigenous forests for multiple purposes (e.g., for food, fuel, fodder\nfor cattle, dyes, herbs, medicines, building materials, and household\nutensils).  Similarly, in Sierra Leone a study by feminist foresters\nrevealed that, on the average, local men could name only eight\ndifferent uses of local species of trees, while local women could name\nthirty-two uses of the same species of trees. The epistemological\nclaim is that women of Sierra Leone have \u201cindigenous technical\nknowledge\u201d (ITK) about forest uses and production that is\nbased on their daily, lived, gendered experiences in connection\nwith forest use and management (Sally Fairfax and Fortmann 1990:\n267). Their knowledge is borne from their situated, gendered,\nconcrete, daily experiences as women.\nAn ecofeminist epistemology also shows that a gendered\nenvironmental perspective is important to understanding\nepistemological methods of inquiry and forms of justification\nconcerning women and nature. Consider orthodox Western forestry. Too\noften it has assumed that activities that fall outside the realm of\ncommercial fiber production are less important than those that fall\ninside that realm. Yet the latter are precisely the activities that\nrural women in many parts of Africa and India engage in on a daily\nbasis. Failure to understand the importance of these activities often\nmakes women \u201cinvisible\u201d. This invisibility helps explains\nwhy many orthodox, Western foresters\n\n\nliterally do not see trees that are used as hedgerows or living\nfence poles; trees that provide materials for basketry, dyes,\nmedicines, or decorations; trees that provide sites for honey barrels;\ntrees that provide fodder; trees that have religious significance;\ntrees that provide shade; or trees that provide human food. \n\nBecause many foresters literally do not see the enormous variety in\nthe use of trees, they frequently do not see the vast number of\nspecies that are useful \u2026 that men and women may have very\ndifferent uses for the same tree or may use different trees for\ndifferent purposes. (Fairfax and Fortmann 1990: 268\u20139)\n\nWhen Western foresters literally do not see these activities, they\nalso do not see different methods women have for using different trees\nfor different purposes. They do not see gendered environmental\nknowledge that is based on what local women do and know best.\nThese examples and data challenge canonical conceptions of\nknowledge as objective and of the knower as impartial, detached, and\ngender-neutral.  They also challenge traditional research\nmethodologies by encouraging researchers to situate themselves and\ntheir research projects within specific historical, cultural, and\neconomic contexts. They also illustrate ways theory and practice are\ninterdependent: theory must \u201cfit the facts\u201d and \u201cthe\nfacts\u201d (e.g., the empirical data) must inform the theory.\n",
