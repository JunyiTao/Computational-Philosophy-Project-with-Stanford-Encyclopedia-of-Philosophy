    "main_text": "Terminology || \u201cCompetence\u201d or \u201cCapacity\u201d?\n1.1 \u201cCompetence\u201d or \u201cCapacity\u201d?\n\nAs defined above the term \u201cdecisional capacity\u201d refers to\nthe ability of subjects to make medical decisions; primarily,\ndecisions to consent to or refuse medical intervention. Yet somewhat\nsurprisingly, (at least for those new to the topic) there is a large\namount of disagreement over terminology in this area, particularly\nover whether \u201cdecisional capacity\u201d and its shortened\nversion, \u201ccapacity\u201d are the right terms to use. The other\ncandidate is \u201cmental competence\u201d or just\n\u201ccompetence\u201d for short. Disputes about how (if at all)\nthese terms differ can be very confusing and sadly there is no remedy\nother than familiarity with the various things people have said.\n\nOne potential problem with the term \u201ccompetence\u201d is that\nin other areas of law it is used more widely to refer to capacities\nthat go beyond those deemed significant in medical contexts. For\nexample, in criminal law, competence to stand trial usually requires\nknowing the difference between right and wrong. But such knowledge is\nnot part of competence (or capacity) for medical decisions.\n\nAlso relevant is the fact that the law (again in other non-medical\nareas) often seeks to make global assessments of a\nperson\u2019s decision-making abilities. For example, a global\ndetermination of incompetence to manage one\u2019s affairs may lead\nto one person losing a wide range of personal freedoms. It would\ntypically result in a family member or guardian being appointed to\nlook out for that individual\u2019s finances, living arrangements\netc. In short, a great many decisions are now off limits for that\nindividual. But in medical contexts, such global assessments are no\nlonger thought to be appropriate. Instead, the focus is supposed to be\non particular decisions (see decision relativity in\n \u00a75.2).\n Thus an individual can be deemed capable of making one decision, but\nnot another. \n\nNonetheless, some version of legal/medical divide is often appealed to\nas part of explaining the difference between competence and capacity.\nOne common explanation begins by focusing on who makes the\ndetermination: a clinician or a judge. It is said that a\nclinical assessment is a determination of \u201cdecisional\ncapacity\u201d, whereas \u201ccompetence\u201d refers to a legal\nassessment (Ganzini et al. 2005: S101). Yet despite the popularity of\nthis way of carving things up, the distinction breaks down in\npractice. On the one hand, clinicians who assess decisional capacity,\noften make assessments that effectively carry the weight of a legal\njudgment, even though the courts are not involved (Grisso &\nAppelbaum 1998: 11; Kim 2010: 17). Indeed, such assessments typically\nhave legal authority until or unless challenged in a court. On the\nother hand, these days many judges confronting particular cases of\nmedical decision-making restrict their focus to questions about the\nability of the patient to make the decision at hand.\n\nEven so, in some legal jurisdictions, like Britain, the term\n\u201ccapacity\u201d (or \u201cdecisional capacity\u201d) is\nusually taken to be a legal one (Tan & Elphick 2002). On the other\nhand, in the United States, it is the terminology of\n\u201ccompetence\u201d (or \u201cmental competence\u201d) that is\noften said to carry legal connotations and authority (Buchanan 2004;\nBerg, Appelbaum, & Grisso 1996). None of this is very helpful,\nsince as soon as we switch jurisdictions or engage in comparative\nwork, terms change.\n\nOne well-known text in this area solves the problem by developing a\nnew hybrid term. In their book, Deciding for Others, Allen\nBuchanan and Dan Brock write that, \u201ccompetence is competence\nfor some task, competence to do something\u201d\n(Buchanan & Brock 1989: 84; emphasis in original). They then\nspecify their own focus, which is \u201ccompetence to make a\ndecision\u201d (Ibid). This leads to a lengthy discussion of\nwhat the authors call \u201cdecision-making competence\u201d and its\nstandards, as well as the specific \u201cdecision-making\ncapacities\u201d that are said to underlie what they call\n\u201cdecisional competence\u201d. According to this strategy, the\nintroduction of a new term\u2014\u201cdecisional competence\u201d\nis the proposed solution. Unfortunately, this stipulative solution\narguably compounds rather than simplifies the problem, since it is\nmore common to speak of \u201cdecisional capacity\u201d than\n\u201cdecisional competence\u201d.\n\nThomas Grisso and Paul Appelbaum, in their landmark study,\nCompetence to Consent to Treatment, adopt yet a further\napproach. They explain:\n\n\n\u2026we talk of \u201cdecision-making capacities\u201d when we\nrefer to the abilities related to decisions. We use the term\n\u201ccompetence\u201d, however, to denote the state in which a\npatient\u2019s decision-making capacities are sufficiently intact for\ntheir decisions to be honored (and conversely for incompetence)\nregardless of who makes the determination. (Grisso & Appelbaum\n1998: 11)\n\n\nIn general, within the narrower realm of medical decision-making\n(which we take to include decisions to participate in clinical\nresearch) the two terms are roughly interchangeable or should be. For\nthis reason, many writers adopt the policy of using the terms\ninterchangeably while signaling recognition that this breaks with\ncertain conventions. This usually is done by adding a minor proviso or\ncaveat at the beginning of a discussion to that effect (Charland 2002:\n37 note 1; Checkland 2001: 53, note 2; National Bioethics Advisory\nCommission 1998: Ch 1, note 4). The strategy has the virtue of\navoiding the cumbersome repeated substitution of one term for the\nother in or across discussions where both are used. But it can also\ninadvertently perpetuate confusion of just the sort it is meant to\nobviate. For the rest of this entry the terms will be used\ninterchangeably.\n\nUltimately, what is most important is for readers to be aware of all\nthis terminological confusion and tread carefully. The rule of thumb\nremains: caveat emptor.\n",
