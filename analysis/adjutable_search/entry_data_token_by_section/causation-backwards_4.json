    "main_text": "Philosophy || Distinguishing Cause from Effect\n2.3 Distinguishing Cause from Effect\n\nCan the cause be distinguished from its effect so that the\ndistinction does not depend on a temporal ordering of the events?\nFor a long time the distinction between cause and effect was their\ntemporal order. This view goes at least back to Hume who claimed,\n\u201cWe may define a cause to be an object followed by another, and\nwhere all the objects, similar to the first, are followed by objects\nsimilar to the second,\u201d which is to say that \u201c[\u2026]\nif the first object had not been, the second never had existed\u201d\n(Hume, [1748] 2007, 56).  Although Hume did not explicitly say so, the\nexpression \u201cfollowed by\u201d has always been read as\n\u201ctemporally followed by\u201d and not \u201ccausally followed\nby\u201d. So the adherents of this definition have usually tried to\ngive an account of causation in which the cause and the effect are\nseen as temporal regularities between types of events. But we can also\nsee that Hume himself added a counterfactual statement about causation\nwhich cannot be derived from his temporal definition. Apparently, he\nnoticed that if we have a cause and an effect, there exists a\nrelationship between them that is not given by the temporal order.\n\nWhat is required for backward causation to be possible is some account\nof the direction of causation which does not rely on the direction of\ntime. Various alternative proposals refer to counterfactuals,\nprobabilities, agency, manipulation and intervention, common cause or\ncausal forks. Among these it seems that only a Humean notion of\ncausation explicitly makes a temporal identification of the cause and\nthe effect. But there are also problems with some of the other\naccounts.\n\nFor example, it is quite common to follow David Lewis and define\ncausation in terms of counterfactuals (Lewis, 1973). Assume event\n\\(c\\) causes event \\(e\\), then we have a situation in which both \\(c\\)\nand \\(e\\) occur, and in which the counterfactual statement \u201cIf \\(c\\)\nhad not occurred, then \\(e\\) would not have occurred\u201d is true. Thus, in\nLewis\u2019s view, \\(e\\) is causally dependent on \\(c\\) if, and only if,\n\\(e\\) is counterfactually dependent on \\(c\\). According to the\ntraditional theory, formulated by Lewis and Stalnaker, any\ncounterfactual statement is true if the consequent is true in the\nclosest possible world to the actual world in which the antecedent is\ntrue. Apparently, Lewis\u2019 definition delivers a non-temporal\ncausal asymmetry, since the effect \\(e\\) is counterfactually dependent\non the cause \\(c\\).\n\nAs we saw above, Hume also believed that causal statements entail\ncounterfactuals, but the question is whether causal statements are\ndefinable in terms of counterfactuals. Here is an objection against\nsuch an attempt: Consider the following example. Because of severe\nfrost during the night, ice covers the lake this morning. So, given\nthe circumstances, if it had not been severe frost, there would not\nhave been any ice on the lake. However, in these circumstances, the\nfrost as the cause of the ice seems to be not only causally necessary\nfor the ice, but the frost also seems to be causally sufficient for\nthe ice cover. In other words, given the actual circumstances, it\nseems correct to say that the frost is causally sufficient as well as\nnecessary for the ice. If we are going to represent causally\nsufficiency in terms of a counterfactual statement, we might then say\nthat, given the actual circumstances, if no ice had covered the lake\nthis morning, there would not have been a severe frost during the\nnight. But if one accepts this objection, it shows that causal\nstatements cannot be defined in terms of counterfactuals because such\na definition does not give us the wanted asymmetry between cause and\neffect since each is counterfactually dependent on the other.\n\nSometimes this problem is called the Problem of\nEffects. According to this problem, the effect does not\ndistinguish itself other than temporally from the cause because both\nthe cause and the effect are counterfactually dependent on each\nother. Over the years several attempts have provided solutions to this\nproblem. Lewis himself proposed some criteria consisting of a\nhierarchy of possible worlds such that a world in which \\(c\\) occurs\nbut \\(e\\) does not occur is closer to the actual world than a world in\nwhich \\(c\\) does not occur due to the absence of \\(e\\). But a number\nof philosophers have challenged the aptness of these criteria, among\nothers Bennett (1974); Faye (1989); Horwich (1993); Baker (2003); Choi\n(2007); Wasserman (2015), and Seli (2020).\n\nHowever, and more importantly in the present context, is that\nStalnaker-Lewis\u2019 theory of counterfactuals has difficulties with\nbacktracking counterfactuals and backward causation because if \\(c\\)\noccurs later than \\(e\\), the proposed method of truth evaluation\nassumes that \\(e\\) occurs in the relevant possible worlds in which\n\\(c\\) does not occur. In general, the assessment of a counterfactual\nconditional is carried out by assuming that the possible world must be\nidentical with the actual world up to \\(c\\). Therefore, it is\nstipulated that the closest possible world is one in which everything\nhappens just as in the actual world up to the time of \\(c\\)\u2019s\noccurrence, which means, given \\(e\\) occurs before \\(c\\), that the\npossible world will include the occurrence of \\(e\\). But then it is\nnecessarily true that there is never a possible world closer to the\nactual world which includes \\(c\\) but not \\(e\\). This creates a\nproblem because we consider any causal connection between \\(c\\) and\n\\(e\\) as contingent. Rather we would expect that if we face a case of\nbackward causation where both a present event \\(c\\) and a past\nevent\\(e\\) occur, the following counterfactual would be true: \u201cIf\n\\(c\\) had not occurred, then \\(e\\) would not have occurred.\u201d The truth\nevaluation of this counterfactual, if it were to represent backward\ncausation, would require that the closest world without \\(c\\) is also\none without \\(e\\). Nevertheless, the traditional theory does not allow\nsuch an evaluation.\n\nHow else can causality be specified so that the order of the\ncause-effect relationship is not time-dependent? Several possibilities\nseem open for such an account. Here we shall just mentioned some. One\ncould hold that the cause makes the effect more probable in the\ncircumstances; one could argue that causation can be understood in\nterms of manipulation and intervention; one could argue that we can\nspecify causation in terms of transmission of information or conserved\nphysical quantities. Or, finally, one could argue that causality is a\nprimitive notion that may imply, or be used to explain, regularities,\ncounterfactuals, probabilities, transmission of signals, or\nmanipulation and intervention, but it cannot be completely analyzed in\nany of these terms. If we take into consideration that higher animals\nshow a sense of causation, it may be a good indication that the origin\nof this notion goes back in history and that it stems from the\ncognitive evolution of grasping in which ways one\u2019s environment is\nstable and in which ways one\u2019s behavior can interact and change the\nenvironment.\n\nThis observation may come close to Lewis much later analysis of\ncausation as influence (Lewis, 2000). Thus, it is through our ability\nto influence our environment that we improve our ability to manipulate\nand intervene in the cause of events and through which we receive\nknowledge of causal relationships and the causal order of this\nrelationship (Faye, 1989; Woodward, 2003). However, such an\nunderstanding of causation is already rather complex, building on our\ncapacity of foreseeing the effect of our own actions, on our capacity\nof foreseeing the effects of others\u2019 actions, on our understanding the\ncause of others actions, and on our understanding the cause of\nphysical events (G\u00e4rdenfors, 2006, p. 41).\n",
