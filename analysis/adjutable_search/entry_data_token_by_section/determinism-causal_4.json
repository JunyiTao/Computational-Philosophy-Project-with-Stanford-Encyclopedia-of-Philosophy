    "main_text": "Conceptual Issues in Determinism || Thereafter\n2.3 Thereafter\n\nFor a wide class of physical theories (i.e., proposed sets of laws of\nnature), if they can be viewed as deterministic at all, they can be\nviewed as bi-directionally deterministic. That is, a\nspecification of the state of the world at a time t, along\nwith the laws, determines not only how things go after t, but\nalso how things go before t. Philosophers, while not exactly\nunaware of this symmetry, tend to ignore it when thinking of the\nbearing of determinism on the free will issue. The reason for this is\nthat, as noted just above, we tend to think of the past (and hence,\nstates of the world in the past) as sharp and determinate,\nand hence fixed and beyond our control. Forward-looking\ndeterminism then entails that these past states\u2014beyond our\ncontrol, perhaps occurring long before humans even\nexisted\u2014determine everything we do in our lives. It then seems a\nmere curious fact that it is equally true that the state of the world\nnow determines everything that happened in the past. We have\nan ingrained habit of taking the direction of both causation and\nexplanation as being past \u2192 present, even when discussing\nphysical theories free of any such asymmetry. We will return to this\npoint shortly.\n\nAnother point to notice here is that the notion of things being\ndetermined thereafter is usually taken in an unlimited\nsense\u2014i.e., determination of all future events, no matter how\nremote in time. But conceptually speaking, the world could be only\nimperfectly deterministic: things could be determined only,\nsay, for a thousand years or so from any given starting state of the\nworld. For example, suppose that near-perfect determinism were\nregularly (but infrequently) interrupted by spontaneous particle\ncreation events, which occur only once every thousand years in a\nthousand-light-year-radius volume of space. This unrealistic example\nshows how determinism could be strictly false, and yet the world be\ndeterministic enough for our concerns about free action to be\nunchanged.\n",
