    "main_text": "Four schools || Intuitionism\n2.2 Intuitionism\n\nIntuitionism originates in the work of the mathematician L.E.J.\nBrouwer (van Atten 2004), and it is inspired by Kantian views of what\nobjects are (Parsons 2008, chapter 1). According to intuitionism,\nmathematics is essentially an activity of construction. The natural\nnumbers are mental constructions, the real numbers are mental\nconstructions, proofs and theorems are mental constructions,\nmathematical meaning is a mental construction\u2026 Mathematical\nconstructions are produced by the ideal mathematician, i.e.,\nabstraction is made from contingent, physical limitations of the real\nlife mathematician. But even the ideal mathematician remains a finite\nbeing. She can never complete an infinite construction, even though\nshe can complete arbitrarily large finite initial parts of it. This\nentails that intuitionism resolutely rejects the existence of the\nactual (or completed) infinite; only potentially infinite collections\nare given in the activity of construction. A basic example is the\nsuccessive construction in time of the individual natural numbers.\n\nFrom these general considerations about the nature of mathematics,\nbased on the condition of the human mind (Moore 2001), intuitionists\ninfer to a revisionist stance in logic and mathematics. They find\nnon-constructive existence proofs unacceptable. Non-constructive\nexistence proofs are proofs that purport to demonstrate the existence\nof a mathematical entity having a certain property without even\nimplicitly containing a method for generating an example of such an\nentity. Intuitionism rejects non-constructive existence proofs as\n\u2018theological\u2019 and \u2018metaphysical\u2019. The\ncharacteristic feature of non-constructive existence proofs is that\nthey make essential use of the principle of excluded\nthird \n\n\\[ \\phi \\vee \\neg \\phi, \\]\n\n\nor one of its equivalents, such as the principle of double\nnegation \n\n\\[ \\neg \\neg \\phi \\rightarrow \\phi \\]\n\n\nIn classical logic, these principles are valid. The logic of\nintuitionistic mathematics is obtained by removing the principle of\nexcluded third (and its equivalents) from classical logic. This of\ncourse leads to a revision of mathematical knowledge. For instance,\nthe classical theory of elementary arithmetic, Peano\nArithmetic, can no longer be accepted. Instead, an intuitionistic\ntheory of arithmetic (called Heyting Arithmetic) is proposed\nwhich does not contain the principle of excluded third. Although\nintuitionistic elementary arithmetic is weaker than classical\nelementary arithmetic, the difference is not all that great. There\nexists a simple syntactical translation which translates all classical\ntheorems of arithmetic into theorems which are intuitionistically\nprovable.\n\nIn the first decades of the twentieth century, parts of the\nmathematical community were sympathetic to the intuitionistic critique\nof classical mathematics and to the alternative that it proposed. This\nsituation changed when it became clear that in higher mathematics, the\nintuitionistic alternative differs rather drastically from the\nclassical theory. For instance, intuitionistic mathematical analysis\nis a fairly complicated theory, and it is very different from\nclassical mathematical analysis. This dampened the enthusiasm of the\nmathematical community for the intuitionistic project. Nevertheless,\nfollowers of Brouwer have continued to develop intuitionistic\nmathematics onto the present day (Troelstra & van Dalen 1988).\n",
