This\ntheory, usually known as the \u201cDream of Socrates\u201d or the\n\u201cDream Theory,\u201d posits two kinds of existents, complexes\nand simples, and proposes that \u201can account\u201d means\n\u201can account of the complexes that analyses them into their\nsimple components.\u201d Thus \u201cknowledge of x\u201d\nturns out to mean \u201ctrue belief about x with an account\nof x that analyses x into its simple\ncomponents.\u201d\n\n\nTaken as a general account of knowledge, the Dream Theory implies that\nknowledge is only of complexes, and that there can be no knowledge of\nsimples. Socrates attacks this implication.\n\n\nA common question about the Dream Theory is whether it is concerned\nwith objectual or propositional knowledge. Those who take the Dream\nTheory to be concerned with propositional knowledge include\nRyle 1990: 27\u201330: \u201cfrom 201 onwards Plato concentrates on\n\u2018know\u2019 (conna\u00eetre): [Socrates\u2019 Dream] is a\nlogician\u2019s theory, a theory about the composition of truths and\nfalsehoods.\u201d Those who take the Dream Theory to be concerned\nwith objectual knowledge include White 1976: 177, and Crombie\n1963: II: 41\u201342; also Bostock 1988. A third way of taking the Dream\nTheory, which may well be the most promising interpretation, is to\ntake it as a Logical Atomism: as a theory which founds an\naccount of propositional structure on an account of the concatenation\nof simple objects of experience or acquaintance such as \u201csense\ndata.\u201d\n\n\nThe Logical-Atomist reading of the Dream Theory undercuts the\npropositional/objectual distinction. On this reading, the Dream\nTheory claims that simple, private objects of experience are the\nelements of the proposition; thus, the Dream Theory is both a\ntheory about the structure of propositions and a theory about\nsimple and complex objects. It claims in effect that a proposition\u2019s\nstructure is that of a complex object made up out of simple objects,\nwhere these simple objects are conceived in the Russellian manner as\nobjects of inner perception or acquaintance, and the complexes which\nthey compose are conceived in the phenomenalist manner as\n(epistemological and/ or semantic) constructs out of those simple\nobjects.\n\n\nThis supposition makes good sense of the claim that we ourselves are\nexamples of complexes (201e2: \u201cthe primary elements\n(pr\u00f4ta stoikheia) of which we and everything else are\ncomposed\u2026\u201d). If the Dream theorist is a Logical Atomist,\nhe will think that there is a clear sense in which people, and\neverything else, are composed out of sense data. He will also think\nthat descriptions of objects, too, are complexes constructed in\nanother way out of the immediately available simples of sensation.\n\n\nFor such a theorist, epistemology and semantics alike rest upon the\nfoundation provided by the simple objects of acquaintance. Both\nthought and meaning consist in the construction of complex objects out\nof those simple objects. Philosophical analysis, meanwhile, consists\nin stating how the complexes involved in thought and meaning\nare constructed out of simples. This statement involves, amongst other\nthings, dividing down to and enumerating the (simple) parts of such\ncomplexes.\n\n\nWhat then is the relation of the Dream Theory to the problems posed\nfor empiricism by the discussion of D2 in 187\u2013201?  The fundamental\nproblem for empiricism, as we saw, is the problem how to get from\nsensation to content: the problem of how we could start with bare\nsense-data, and build up out of them anything that deserved to be\ncalled meaning. Plato thinks that there is a good answer to\nthis, though it is not an empiricist answer. Sense experience becomes\ncontentful when it is understood and arranged according to the\nstructures that the Forms give it. So to understand sense experience\nis, in the truest sense, \u201cto give an account\u201d for it.\n\n\nThe empiricist cannot offer this answer to the problem of how to get\nfrom sensation to content without ceasing to be an empiricist. What\nthe empiricist can do is propose that content arises out of\nsets of sense experiences. We get to the level of belief and knowledge\nonly when we start to consider such sets: before that we are at the\nlevel only of perception. Our beliefs, couched in expressions that\nrefer to and quantify over such sets, will then become knowledge (a)\nwhen they are true, and (b) when we understand the full story of their\ncomposition out of such sets.\n\n\nIf this is the point of the Dream Theory, then the best answer to the\nquestion \u201cWhose is the Dream Theory?\u201d is \u201cIt belongs\nto the empiricist whom Plato is attacking.\u201d\n",
