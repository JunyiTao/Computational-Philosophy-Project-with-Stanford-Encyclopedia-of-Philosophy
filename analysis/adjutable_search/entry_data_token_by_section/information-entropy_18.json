    "main_text": "The Role of Quantum Theory\n5. The Role of Quantum Theory\n\n\nThe relationship between quantum theory, measurement and\nirreversibility is a complex one, and considering the effect of\nquantum theory on the argument has lead to sometimes surprising claims\nbeing made.\n\n\nVon Neumann explicitly referred to Szilard's argument in (von\nNeumann 1932, Chapter V.2), when discussing the irreversibility of\nwavefunction collapse on measurement, although it is unclear precisely\nwhat role this was intended to play. Both Gabor and Brillouin's\nmeasurement procedures, using light, required the quantised treatment\nof the electromagnetic field to produce dissipation. Gabor stated quite\nclearly his belief that measurement by classical electromagnetic fields\ncould take place non-dissipatively and would lead to unconstrained\nviolations of the second law. The Landauer-Penrose-Bennett argument\ndoes not require measurements to generate heat, so for them, classical\nstatistical mechanics need not lead to untamed demons. Although it\nmight still be argued that quantum electrodynamics dissipates heat if\nused for measurement, the fact that some physical processes for\nmeasurement dissipate heat does not undermine Bennett's claim that\nother physical processes can perform measurements\nnon-dissipatively.\n\n\nStill, wavefunction collapse is frequently associated with\nthermodynamic irreversibility. It might seem there is a contradiction\nhere, as measurement, in the Szilard engine, is supposed to lead to the\npossibility of a decrease in entropy, while measurement, in quantum\ntheory, is supposed to increase entropy. Alternatively, it may be\nwondered if the entropy increase in wavefunction collapse offsets the\nreduction from measurement. These thoughts are largely a confusion\nwhich can be easily remedied. A projective, von Neumann, measurement\nwill increase the Gibbs-von Neumann entropy of a density matrix unless\nthe observable being measured commutes with the density matrix, in\nwhich case the measurement will leave it constant. This, however,\napplies to the density matrix that describes the statistical\ndistribution over all the measurement outcomes. The subensemble density\nmatrix that corresponds to a particular outcome having occurred can\nstill have a lower Gibbs-von Neumann entropy than the ensemble over all\nmeasurement outcomes.\n\n\nZurek (1986) is the most prominent example of attempts to relate\nquantum measurement to the Szilard engine. Zurek suggested that a\nmolecule being in a superposition of being on either side of the\npartition, in the Szilard engine, is not subjective uncertainty as to\nwhich side the molecule is located. Instead it is an objective fact\nthat the quantum state occupies both sides. Even with the partition\npresent, the molecule occupies the entire box. Until a measurement is\nperformed, collapsing the quantum state to one side or the other, work\ncannot be extracted. Zurek still regarded the resetting operation as\nthe source of compensating entropy increase. This is justified as\nnecessary on the basis that the demon, having performed the measurement\nand extracted the work, is now in a statistical mixture of having\nobserved each of the possible outcomes. For the cost of resetting the\ndemon, Zurek appealed directly to Landauer's principle.\n\n\nThe logic here is hard to follow. If there was something ambiguous\nor troubling, in the classical situation, about having to refer to\nsubjective uncertainty over the location of the molecule while there is\nan objective fact on the matter, then it should be at least as\ntroubling to have to refer to the statistical mixture of the demon's\nstates when deciding to perform the resetting operation. Zurek did not\nseem to suggest that the demon is to be regarded as being in a\nsuperposition of measurement outcomes (if it were, then it could\npresumably be reset to a standard state with a lower cost). It seems\nassumed that there was a matter of fact about which outcome occurred\nand therefore which state the demon is in. Also ambiguous is whether we\nare to understand the measurement as a non-unitary wavefunction\ncollapse to one outcome or the other. If wavefunction collapse is to be\nregarded as a necessary component in understanding the absence of\ndemons, where does this leave no-collapse interpretations?\n\n\nIt is also important to bear in mind that all attempts to derive\nLandauer's principle, to date, have been based upon classical\ninformation processing. While it would appear that a lower bound, very\nsimilar in form to Landauer's principle, can be derived for quantum\ncomputational operations, unlike the classical case there appears no\nproof as yet of the existence of processes that can in principle reach\nthis bound. It remains possible, therefore, that quantum computations\nmay need to incur additional thermodynamic costs. This appears to be\ntrue even for the quantum analog of logically reversible operations:\nBennett's (1973) procedure for avoiding the cost of storing additional\nbits involves an operation which cannot in general be applied to\nquantum operations (Maroney 2004 [in Other Internet Resources]). Finally, as noted above,\nAllahverdyan and Nieuwenhuizen argued in the opposite direction, that\nthe derivations of this lower bound involve assumptions which can be\nviolated by quantum theory in the low temperature regime.\n",
