    "main_text": "Moral principles || Some examples\n3.4 Some examples\n\nThe three examples or sets of examples considered in this section are\nonly examples of the kinds of moral norms (praecepta) which\nAquinas considers are excluded by any sound conscience from\none\u2019s deliberations about what to choose. Other examples are\nmore complex, such as theft and various other wrongful deprivations of\nproperty, and the form of charging for loans which is named usury and\njudged by Aquinas (not implausibly, though with little direct\napplicability to developed financial markets: see Finnis 1998,\n204\u2013210) to be always contrary to just equality. Aquinas also\ntreats in some detail scores, indeed hundreds of other moral issues,\ntouching the life of judges, advocates, merchants, the rich, the poor,\nor everyone.\n3.4.1 Homicide\n\nSome types of act are intrinsically and immediately contrary to the\nbasic human good of life, that is to a human being\u2019s very being.\nEvery act which is intended, whether as end or as means, to kill an\ninnocent human being, and every act done by a private person which is\nintended to kill any human being, is to be excluded from\ndeliberation as wrongful because contrary to love of neighbor as self\n(or self as neighbor). Public persons, Aquinas thinks, can rightfully\nintend to kill in carrying out needful acts of war, suppression of\nserious wrongdoing, and punishment (see also 6.3 below).\n\nAs a private person one may rightfully use force in defense of oneself\nor others even if the force is such that one foresees it is likely or\neven certain to kill; but one\u2019s intention in using such lethal\nforce must not be to kill, but only to disable and block the attack\n(and less lethal force would not have met the need for defensive\nblocking of the assault). Aquinas\u2019 discussion of this\n(ST II-II q. 64 a.7) is the locus classicus for what later\nbecame known, unhappily, as the \u201cprinciple\u201d of double\neffect, whose real core is the thought that moral principles bear\ndifferently on kinds of action specified by intention (e.g.\nto kill) from the way they bear on behavior chosen with\nforesight that it will (probably or even certainly) kill\nas a side-effect (praeter intentionem \u2013\noutside the acting person\u2019s intention).\n\nAquinas wavers between suggesting that the use of lethal public force,\ne.g. in capital punishment, intends (\u201cis referred to\u201d)\njustice rather than killing, and plainly accepting that in such cases\ndeath is indeed intended. The latter is his dominant position; his\narguments to justify a kind of choice which, whatever its beneficial\nconsequences, is so immediately against the good of life have come\nincreasingly to seem insufficient: the Catechism of the Catholic\nChurch (1993), paras. 2263\u201367 expounds its whole teaching\non war, lethal police action, and capital punishment on the basis of\nthe thought that these can be justified only so far as they amount to\ncausing death as a side-effect, and not as killing with intent to\nkill. The thought is formulated by appeal to Aquinas\u2019 reference\nto acts with \u201cdouble effect\u201d in his discussion of\nprivate defence in ST II-II q. 64 a. 7.\n3.4.2 Adultery and other kinds of act contrary to the good of marriage\n\nMarriage is, Aquinas says, a primary human good and, philosophically\nconsidered, it has a dual point (end, finis): (i) the\nprocreation and bringing up of children is a manner suited to their\ngood, and (ii) fides, which goes far beyond the literal\ntranslation \u201cfaithfulness\u201d and includes not only\nexclusivity and permanence but also the positive readiness and\ncommitment to being united with one\u2019s spouse in mind, body and a\nmutually assisting domestic life. Aquinas neither subordinates one of\nthese two \u201cends\u201d to the other, nor regards it as\nappropriate to choose to divide them. Fides is a good and\nsufficient reason for engaging in the usus matrimonii, the\nkind of sexual act that is intended to enable both husband and wife to\nexperience and in a particular way actualize and express the good of\ntheir marriage, so that the act\u2019s giving and receiving of\ndelight is token of their commitment.\n\nConsequently the kind of wrongful sexual choice most often considered\nby Aquinas is engaging in intercourse with one\u2019s spouse without\nfides, because one either (i) is thinking of one\u2019s\nspouse in the way one would think of a prostitute, or (significantly\nworse) (ii) would be willing to have sex with somebody else if some\nother attractive person were to be available. Such depersonalized sex\nacts are instances of willing against the good of marriage (contra\nbonum matrimonii). This reiterated analysis should be regarded as\nthe key to Aquinas\u2019 sex ethics. Another paradigmatic kind of\ninstance, in itself much more serious, is a married person\u2019s\nchoice to have intercourse with some third party (perhaps with the\nother spouse\u2019s consent). These and all other wrongful kinds of\nsex act have their wrongfulness, according to Aquinas, not because\nthey are unnatural in some biological or sociological sense of\n\u201cunnatural\u201d, but because they are against reason\u2019s\ndirective to respect, if not also pursue, the good of marriage, a\nrespect that calls for reserving to marriage (and within marriage to\ntruly marital intercourse) all uses of one\u2019s capacity to engage\nin the intentional pursuit of sexual satisfaction. For unless one\nregards such reservation as required, one\u2019s stance about human\nsex acts is contra bonum matrimonii and unreasonable because\none cannot coherently maintain that the intercourse of the married\nenables them to actualize and experience their fides and\ntheir marriage, a thought essential to the flourishing\n(bonum) of marriage and thus of children and thus of the\nwider community as a whole. One measure of the gravity of morally bad\nsex acts is applicable to some kinds but not others: injustice (as in\nrape or seduction of the vulnerable). Another measure, applicable to\nall such acts, is the extent of the deviance (\u201cdistance\u201d)\nbetween acts of that kind and truly marital acts.\n\nAs in ours, many in Aquinas\u2019 milieu found it difficult to\nunderstand how mutually agreeable sex could be a serious moral issue,\nor indeed a moral issue at all. Aquinas noted this, but was clear that\nevery kind of conduct that acts out and thus confirms and reinforces a\ndisposition of will contra bonum matrimonii is seriously\nwrong because so many aspects of individual and social flourishing\nprofoundly depend upon the health of the institution of marriage, as\nit exists in the real lives of adults and children. It is worth\nrepeating, since the point is so often misunderstood and misreported,\nthat Aquinas\u2019 moral arguments for distinguishing good from bad\nsex never run from \u201cnatural\u201d to \u201ctherefore\ngood/reasonable/right\u201d, but always from\n\u201cgood/reasonable/right\u201d to therefore \u201cnatural\u201d\n(and similarly, of course, for unreasonable and unnatural): see II-II\nq. 153 a. 2c, a. 3c, q. 154 a. 1c, a. 2 ad 2, a. 11.\n3.4.3 Lying\n\nAquinas\u2019 thesis is that lying, properly defined, is always to be\nexcluded as to some extent wrong. The thesis is often misunderstood as\nbeing premised on the thought that lying is contrary to the natural\nfunction of tongue or speech, a thought that has often been transposed\ninto an effort to explain his theses about the wrong kinds of sex act.\nBut, as has been seen, his sex ethics has another and more plausible\nbasis, and so, it seems (albeit less clearly), has his ethics of\nlying. Though all his treatments include something like \u201cwords\nare naturally signs of what one understand\u201d (ST II-II q. 110 a.\n3) or \u201cspeech was invented for expressing the conceptions in\none\u2019s heart\u201d (Sent. III d. 38 a. 3c), this\nstatement is pointing to a more explanatory and prior premise,\ndiscernible though never adequately articulated so as to show its\nrelation to basic human goods. This prior premise turns on his\ndefinition of lying as one\u2019s assertion of what one\nbelieves to be false. Whenever one asserts, one affirms as true two\npropositions: explicitly the proposition one articulates as true\ndespite one\u2019s belief that it is not, and implicitly the\nproposition that one believes what one is assertively articulating. So\nAquinas seems to locate the essential wrongfulness of lying in this\nintentional dissonance between the self presented or reported\nand one\u2019s real self: a duplicitas. It is often\nreasonable and even morally necessary to hide one\u2019s beliefs, and\nthis, not \u201cdeception\u201d, is what Aquinas means by the\n\u201cprudent dissimulatio\u201d he thinks justifiable in\nappropriate contexts. But one should not do so by the spurious\nself-projection entailed by asserting what one believes false.\nPretended flight as a device for luring an unjust enemy into an ambush\ncan be right in a just war, but lying to the enemy is wrong, although\nits gravity is much diminished by the duty not to reveal the truth to\nthe enemy, a duty compatible with the coexisting duty not to lie.\nSubsequent scholars in his tradition have wondered whether the\nconditions of discourse with an unjust opponent do not, at least in\nmany circumstances, defeat the presumption that a grammatically\nindicative statement asserts what it is put forward to seem\nto assert.\n3.4.4 Exceptionless negative norms: more urgent though not all or always more important\n\nNegative norms such as the three sets of norms just discussed are more\nurgent and direct as implications of love of self and neighbor, but\nare not necessarily more important in other dimensions of importance.\nThat is to say, they are applicable and to be followed semper et\nad semper, always and in all circumstances, whereas the\napplicability of affirmative norms (requiring one to act in a\nspecified kind of way) is semper sed non ad semper: always\napplicable subject to there being (as is not always the case) suitable\ncircumstances. Kinds of conduct that are contrary to a negative moral\nnorm of this type are \u201cintrinsically wrongful\u201d\n(intrinsece mala).\n\nOnly negative norms can be exceptionless (and not all negative moral\nnorms are). If affirmative norms could be exceptionless, there would\nbe inescapable conflicts of obligation, but since morality is simply\n(the set of standards of) full reasonableness, there can be no\nconflict of duties each truly and inescapably obligatory in one and\nthe same situation: one cannot truly be perplexus simpliciter\n\u2013 that is, in a dilemma such that, through no fault of\none\u2019s own, any choice one makes will be immoral. (It is,\nhowever, possible that my prior wrongful choices or my culpable\nnegligence in forming my conscience put me into a situation such that\nI have applicable and irreconcilable duties and will be in breach of\none or more of them whatever I choose or do or omit: I am then\nperplexus secundum quid, that is, in a dilemma but of a\nqualified, derivative kind, only in a weak sense unavoidable.)\n",
