    "main_text": "The Big Five || Background\n3.1 Background\n\nThe Big Five model is a taxonomy of personality traits. But before\njumping into the details, something should be said, even if too\nbriefly, about the relationship between personality traits and\ncharacter traits. Strikingly, for many decades in the twentieth\ncentury, psychologists rarely invoked the language of \u201ccharacter\ntraits,\u201d although in recent years this has been changing. The\nhistorical story is complex and beyond the scope of this article, but\none factor responsible for this aversion was the rise of positivism\nand its dismal of value-laden concepts from scientific investigation,\nwith \u201ccharacter\u201d begin regarded as one such concept.\nAnother factor was the rise of situationism in social psychology and\nits related skepticism about the empirical adequacy of traditional\ncharacter traits (for more see Peterson and Seligman 2004: 55\u20139).\n\nSuch factors do not play as much of a role in the recent history of\npsychology, but questions remain about how to classify traits,\nespecially personality and character traits. On one approach, for\ninstance, they are the very same thing. A trait like extraversion\nwould be both a personality trait and a character trait. An\nalternative approach, and one likely favored by philosophers working\non character, is to claim that character traits are only one kind of\npersonality trait. How then would we distinguish between character\nversus non-character personality traits?\n\nThere are several answers that can be given, but no consensus about\nwhat is the right one. One answer is to say that the key issue is\nresponsibility; a character trait is a personality trait for which a\nperson who possesses it is (at least to some degree) responsible for\ndoing so. Another answer is to say that the key issue has to do with\nnormative standards; a character trait is a personality trait for\nwhich a person who has it is, in that respect, an appropriate object\nof normative assessment by the relevant norms (for details about these\napproaches, see Miller 2014: chapter one).\n\nBut instead of unpacking these issues more, let\u2019s turn to the\nBig Five directly. Starting mainly in the 1980s, psychologists arrived\nat the Big Five taxonomy using two different paths (McCrae and John\n1992: 181\u2013187; Goldberg 1993: 30; for a review of earlier work,\nsee John et al. 2008a). Lewis Goldberg is most famously associated\nwith the first. He held that we can learn about personality traits\nfrom ordinary language, as over long periods of time the way we speak\nis shaped by the different ways people tend to be. Here is one\nstatement of his so-called \u201clexical hypothesis\u201d:\n\n\nThe most promising of the empirical approaches to systematizing\npersonality differences have been based on one critical assumption:\nThose individual differences that are of the most significance in the\ndaily transactions of persons with each other will eventually become\nencoded in their language\u2026[this] has a highly significant\ncorollary: The more important is an individual difference in human\ntransactions, the more languages will have an item for it (Goldberg\n1981: 141\u2013142, see also Saucier and Goldberg 1996b).\n\n\nUsing this idea, Goldberg compiled long lists of trait words found in\nordinary language. These are three adjectives from his 1992 list of\n100 Unipolar Markers (Goldberg 1992: 41):\n\nFearful\nFretful\nGenerous\n\n\nTo pare down his list, Goldberg asked study participants to rate from\n1 (extremely inaccurate) to 9 (extremely accurate) how well a\nparticular trait described themselves or others. Then using factor\nanalysis, Goldberg could see which trait adjectives are closely\nrelated to each other, thereby making it reasonable to posit a\n\u201cfactor\u201d or \u201clatent variable\u201d which could\nserve as a more fundamental underlying trait (Goldberg 1990, 1992,\n1993 and Saucier and Goldberg 1996a; for an introduction to factor\nanalysis in psychology, see Leary 2004: 187\u2013192). Fearful and\nfretful, not surprisingly, were highly correlated, and were\ncategorized under the heading of \u201cneuroticism\u201d in the Big\nFive.\n\nA separate line of research also arrived at the Big Five taxonomy.\nHere the idea was not to use trait adjectives, but rather to give\nparticipants entire sentences to use as part of a personality\nquestionnaire. That way, some confusion could be avoided if, for\nexample, they did not know what a word like \u201cfretful\u201d\nmeant.\n\nWhile there are many personality questionnaire used in Big Five\nresearch (such as the NEO-FFI, HEXACO, TDA, BFAS, and BFI), it appears\nthat the NEO-PI-R, developed by the prominent personality\npsychologists Robert McCrae and Paul Costa, continues to be the most\npopular choice. Here are three examples of items participants might\nhave to respond to in taking it (NEO-PI-R Item Booklet-Form S: 3):\n\nI am easily frightened.\nI don\u2019t get much pleasure from chatting with people.\nI don\u2019t take civic duties like voting very seriously.\n\n\nThey would be asked to respond on a 1 to 5 scale anchored on\nstrongly disagree to strongly agree. Factor analysis\nwould then be run on this questionnaire data as well.\n\nMany more analyses have been performed with both adjective and\nquestionnaire data, and using self, friend, spouse, employer, and\nexpert reports (McCrae 1982; McCrae and Costa 1987; Piedmont 1998:\n52\u201356, chapter 5). Extensive cross-cultural work has also been\ndone with the items being translated into dozens of languages (McCrae\nand Costa 1997; Piedmont 1998: 43\u201346, 73\u201374; Caprara and\nCervone 2000: 73\u201375). What often seems to\nemerge are five basic or core personality traits (for a very\nhelpful review, see John et al. 2008a):\n\nExtraversion (also labeled Surgency, Energy, Enthusiasm)\nAgreeableness (also labeled Altruism, Affection)\nConscientiousness (also labeled Constraint, Control of\nImpulse)\nNeuroticism (also labeled Emotional Instability, Negative\nEmotionality, Nervousness)\nOpenness (also labeled Intellect, Culture, Originality,\nOpen-Mindedness)\n\n\nIf it turns out that these five core personality traits are\ncross-culturally universal, then for any given person, you\ncan capture much (some Big Five researchers would even say all) of her\npersonality by determining her standing on these five dimensions. In a\nlarge group of people, you would naturally expect to see differences\nin their comparative standings, with some individuals being high on\nagreeableness and others not, for instance.\n\nIt is important to note that in recent years some empirical challenges\nhave emerged about the cross-cultural universality of the Big Five.\nThis includes divergent findings in some locations in Africa\n(Thalmayer et al. 2020, 2021), South America (Gurven et al. 2013), and\nSouth Asia (Kunnel et al. 2019). Doubts have been expressed more\ngenerally about the applicability of the framework to non-WEIRD\n(western, educated, industrialized, rich, and democratic) populations\n(Laajaj 2019), and a computational model has been developed to explain\ncross-cultural differences in personality (Smaldino et al. 2019). \n\nIn cases where you can arrive at Big Five personality ratings for\na given person, studies have found that you can also use those\nratings to predict other important information about the\nperson as well, including what kinds of thoughts, behavior, and\nconsequences of her behavior you might expect to see (for helpful\nreviews, Ozer and Benet-Mart\u00ednez 2006; Roberts et al. 2007;\nFunder 2007: chapter 7; John et al. 2008a: 141\u2013143). For\nexample, those who are high in conscientiousness have been found to\navoid risky behaviors (Bogg and Roberts 2004) and to have greater\nsuccess on various job performance criteria (Mount and Barrick 1998).\nIn contrast, high neuroticism predicts job dissatisfaction and\ncriminal behavior (perhaps not surprisingly) (Ozer and\nBenet-Mart\u00ednez 2006).\n\nThe five personality traits in the Big Five taxonomy do not, however,\nconstitute the only personality traits. With respect to each of these\ntraits, researchers have identified various sub-traits or\n\u201cfacets\u201d that are less broad and are said to have the\nadvantage of being more accurate. Unfortunately, when it comes to the\nfacet level of traits, there is a lot more controversy in the\nliterature, including how many facets there are for each of the Big\nFive traits as well as what to call them (Costa and McCrae 1995:\n24\u201327; McCrae and Costa 2003: 47; Ozer and Benet-Mart\u00ednez\n2006: 403; Crowe et al. 2018). Here, though, is one widely used\nversion from McCrae and Costa\u2019s work, which appeals to 30 facets\n(Costa and McCrae 1995: 28):\n\n\n\nNeuroticism\nAnxiety, Angry Hostility, Depression, Self-Consciousness,\nImpulsiveness, Vulnerability \n\nExtraversion\nWarmth, Gregariousness, Assertiveness, Activity, Excitement\nSeeking, Positive Emotions \n\nOpenness to Experience\nFantasy, Aesthetics, Feelings, Actions, Ideas, Values \n\nAgreeableness\nTrust, Straightforwardness, Altruism, Compliance, Modesty,\nTender-Mindedness \n\nConscientiousness\nCompetence, Order, Dutifulness, Achievement Striving,\nSelf-Discipline, Deliberation  \n\n\nRecall that McCrae and Costa were the ones who developed the NEO-PI-R\npersonality survey, which has 240 items. Not by accident, 8 items are\nspecifically tailored to measure each of these facets. As examples,\n\u201cI keep my belongings neat and clean\u201d and \u201cI like to\nkeep everything in its place so I know just where it is\u201d fall\nunder the heading of the consciousness facet of order (Costa and\nMcCrae 1992: 73).\n\nThere is much more to the Big Five approach than can be covered here,\nbut let\u2019s move on to its relevance to philosophical issues about\ncharacter (for helpful reviews of the Big Five model, see McCrae and\nJohn 1992; Goldberg 1993; Piedmont 1998; McCrae and Costa 2003:\nchapters 2 and 3; John et al. 2008a).\n",
