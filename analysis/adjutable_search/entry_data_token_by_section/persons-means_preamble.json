    "main_text": "\n\nSometimes it is morally wrong to treat persons as means. When a person\nsays that someone is treating him merely as a means, for\nexample, he often implies that she is failing to abide by a moral\nnorm. Ethically disapproving judgments that a person is \u201cjust\nusing\u201d or sometimes simply \u201cusing\u201d another are\ncommon in everyday discourse (e.g., Goldman & Schmidt 2018).\nAuthors appeal to the idea that research on human subjects (Levine\n2007: 140; Van der Graaf and Van Delden 2012), management of employees\n(Haywood 1918: 217), and criminal punishment (Duff 1986:\n178\u2013179) is wrong if it involves treating persons merely as\nmeans. The notion that treating people in that way is morally\nproblematic has appeared in debate regarding terrorism (Card 2010:\n131), pornography (Baird & Rosenbaum 1998: 103, 106), and\nsurrogate motherhood (Macklin 1994: 64). However, treating others as\nmeans or, equivalently, using them is frequently morally permissible.\nWaiters use customers to get tips; customers treat waiters as means to\ncuisine; professors use students to test their ideas; students use\nprofessors to gain expertise, and so forth. Under what conditions is\nusing another wrong? Philosophers since Kant have tried to answer this\nquestion, at least in part, by offering accounts of when a person uses\nanother and does or does not just use the other, or,\nequivalently, treat him merely as a means. These accounts\ntend to be controversial. Precise sets of conditions for treating (or\nnot treating) persons merely as means seem to have implications that\nto some extent clash with everyday understanding of doing so.\nMoreover, for Kantians, the prohibition on treating persons merely as\na means is a moral constraint: it limits what we may do, even in the\nservice of promoting the overall good. If a surgeon extracting vital\norgans from an unwilling \u201cdonor\u201d would maximize the good,\nsay, by preserving the lives of five people desperate for transplants,\nshe would be treating the donor merely as a means and thereby acting\nwrongly, Kantians would say. Kant himself suggests that this\nconstraint is absolute. The principle Kant deems to be the supreme\nprinciple of morality, the categorical imperative, deems morally wrong\nall actions that treat persons merely as means. But is it plausible to\nhold that all such actions are wrong? Upon reflection, is it even\nplausible to hold that to treat persons merely as means is, typically,\nto act wrongly, rather than just to have an ethically\ninappropriate attitude towards them?\n\nSeveral concepts in ethics overlap with that of treating persons\nmerely as means. For example, to say that a person is exploiting or\nmanipulating another is often to imply that the person is using the\nother in a morally problematic\n way.[1]\n Prototypical cases of coercion such as muggings are also cases of a\nperson, the mugger, treating another, the victim, merely as a means.\nOther concepts that intersect with that of treating someone merely as\na means include those of commodifying and of objectifying a person\n(Davis 1984: 392). Commodifying someone can involve using her as one\nwould use a mere thing, instead of treating her, as one ought, as a\nbeing of higher status, for example.\n\nThis article does not try to untangle the relations between treating\npersons merely as means and these other concepts. It focuses on the\nnotion(s), inspired by Kant and seemingly embraced in ordinary moral\ndiscourse, of treating persons, especially treating others, merely as\nmeans. In the idiom of the article, to say that someone is treating\nanother as a means or, equivalently, using him, implies in itself no\nmoral disapproval. To say that someone is treating a person\nmerely as a means or, equivalently, just using him,\nsuggests that she is using the other in a way subject to ethical\ncriticism. The entry begins by focusing on the roots in Kant of\ndiscussion of treating persons merely as means. It then considers\n(morally neutral) notions of using another or treating him as a means,\nnotions that are less straightforward than it might seem. The third\nsection focuses on attempts to specify sufficient conditions for\ntreating another merely as a means, some of which Kant himself\nsuggests. According to Kant, to treat another merely as a means is to\ndo something morally impermissible; it is to act wrongly. The next\nsection examines challenges to this claim. Finally, the article\nconsiders accounts of when a person uses another, but not merely as a\nmeans.\n",
