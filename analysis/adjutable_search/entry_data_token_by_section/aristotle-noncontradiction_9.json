Dialetheism, Paraconsistency, and Aristotle\n\nAristotle\u2019s account of the PNC has been challenged anew by\nmodern-day dialetheists, who hold that there are some true\ncontradictions, and that Aristotle\u2019s discussion fails to show\notherwise. One approach is to argue that some of Aristotle\u2019s\ndiscussion of PNC begs the question in favor of PNC. (Of course,\nAristotle would agree that any argument in favor of PNC must beg the\nquestion.) Another approach is for dialetheists to refuse to let the\nAristotelian reformulate their supposed counterexamples to PNC by\nadding qualifications so that these supposed counterexamples do not\nviolate PNC after all. The Aristotelian can counter that without those\nqualifications the dialetheist has not said anything meaningful at\nall. Finally, the dialetheist may ask how Aristotle would deal with\nthe liar\u2019s paradoxical sentence \u201cI am lying\u201d. Why is\nthis not both true and false at the same time as the dialetheist\ncontends?\n\nBesides dialetheists, some modern logicians, who need not be\ndialetheists, think that logic can be paraconsistent, i.e., that,\ncontrary to classical logic, one contradiction need not lead to an\nexplosion where anything goes. While Aristotle is obviously not a\ndialetheist, it is not clear where he stands on the issue of\nparaconsistency in Metaph IV. Although Aristotle does claim\nthat if his opponent rejects PNC across the board, she is committed to\na world in which anything goes, he never argues that if (per\nimpossibile) his opponent is committed to one contradiction, she\nis committed to anything, and he even considers that the\nopponent\u2019s view might apply to some statements but not to others\n(Metaph IV 4 1008a10\u201312). However one understands these\npassages, in the Prior Analytics, Aristotle does commit\nhimself to the view that syllogistic is paraconsistent (APr.\nII 15 64a15).\n",
