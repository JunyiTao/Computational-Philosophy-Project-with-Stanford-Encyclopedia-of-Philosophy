In that case,\n\\(\\psi\\) can be seen as part of \\(\\lambda\\) and, therefore, as an\nelement of reality itself. Models of this type are referred to as\n\u201c\\(\\psi\\)-ontic\u201d. In other models, an ontic state\n\\(\\lambda\\) can be the result of preparation procedures associated\nwith different quantum states \\(\\psi\\). In these models, \\(\\psi\\) is\nnot an aspect of reality and is often more naturally seen as\nreflecting an agent\u2019s incomplete knowledge about the underlying\nontic state \\(\\lambda\\). Models of this type are referred to as\n\u201c\\(\\psi\\)-epistemic\u201d. Spekkens (2007) motivates the search\nfor attractive \\(\\psi\\)-epistemic models by pointing out various\nparallels between quantum mechanics and a toy model in which the\nanalogue of the quantum state is epistemic in that it reflects\nincomplete information about an underlying ontic state.\n\nHowever, so-called \u201c\\(\\psi\\)-ontology theorems\u201d (Pusey,\nBarrett, & Rudolph 2012; Hardy 2013; Colbeck & Renner 2012;\nsee Leifer 2014 for an overview), establish that, given certain\nplausible assumptions, only \\(\\psi\\)-ontic models can reproduce the\nempirical consequences of quantum theory. The specific assumptions\nused to derive this conclusion differ for the various theorems. All of\nthem, however, rely on the ontological models framework which, as\nnoted a number of times already, explicitly incorporates an assumption\nof measurement independence (Eq. (\\ref{eq:independence})). Since, as\nshown above, measurement independence implicitly rules out\nretrocausality, these theorems apply only inasmuch as retrocausality\nis assumed to be absent.\n\nMoreover, the theorem due to Pusey, Barrett, and Rudolph\n(2012)\u2014which according to Leifer (2014) uses the least\ncontestable assumptions of all\u2014relies on an additional\nindependence assumption according to which the ontic states of two or\nmore distinct, randomly prepared, systems are uncorrelated before\nundergoing joint measurement. Wharton (2014: 203) points out that in a\nframework that is open to retrocausality this is a problematic\nassumption because one would then expect \u201cpast correlations [to]\narise [\u2026] for exactly the same reason that future correlations\narise in entanglement experiments\u201d. Exploring the prospects for\nretrocausal accounts is therefore one\u2014perhaps\nthe\u2014important open route for developing an attractive\n\\(\\psi\\)-epistemic model that may be able to explain the quantum\ncorrelations.\n",
