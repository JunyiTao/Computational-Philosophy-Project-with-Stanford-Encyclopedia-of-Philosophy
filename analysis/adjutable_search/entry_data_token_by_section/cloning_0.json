    "main_text": "What is Cloning?\n1. What is Cloning?\n\nStrictly speaking, cloning is the creation of a genetic copy of a\nsequence of DNA or of the entire genome of an organism. In the latter\nsense, cloning occurs naturally in the birth of identical twins and\nother multiples. But cloning can also be done artificially in the\nlaboratory via embryo twinning or splitting: an early embryo is split\nin vitro so that both parts, when transferred to a uterus,\ncan develop into individual organisms genetically identical to each\nother. In the cloning debate, however, the term \u2018cloning\u2019\ntypically refers to a technique called somatic cell nuclear transfer\n(SCNT). SCNT involves transferring the nucleus of a somatic cell into\nan oocyte from which the nucleus and thus most of the DNA has been\nremoved. (The mitochondrial DNA in the cytoplasm is still present).\nThe manipulated oocyte is then treated with an electric current in\norder to stimulate cell division, resulting in the formation of an\nembryo. The embryo is (virtually) genetically identical to, and thus a\nclone of the somatic cell donor.\n\nDolly was the first mammal to be brought into the world using SCNT.\nIan Wilmut and his team at the Roslin Institute in Scotland replaced\nthe nucleus from an oocyte taken from a Blackface ewe with the nucleus\nof a cell from the mammary gland of a six-year old Finn Dorset sheep\n(these sheep have a white face). They transferred the resulting embryo\ninto the uterus of a surrogate ewe and approximately five months later\nDolly was born. Dolly had a white face: she was genetically identical\nto the Finn Dorset ewe from which the somatic cell had been\nobtained.\n\nDolly, however, was not 100% genetically identical to the donor\nanimal. Genetic material comes from two sources: the nucleus and the\nmitochondria of a cell. Mitochondria are organelles that serve as\npower sources to the cell. They contain short segments of DNA. In\nDolly\u2019s case, her nuclear DNA was the same as the donor\nanimal; other of her genetic materials came from the mitochondria in\nthe cytoplasm of the enucleated oocyte. For the clone and the donor\nanimal to be exact genetic copies, the oocyte too would have to come\nfrom the donor animal (or from the same maternal line \u2013\nmitochondria are passed on by oocytes).\n\nDolly\u2019s birth was a real breakthrough, for it proved that\nsomething that had been considered biologically impossible could\nindeed be done. Before Dolly, scientists thought that cell\ndifferentiation was irreversible: they believed that, once a cell has\ndifferentiated into a specialized body cell, such as a skin or liver\ncell, the process cannot be reversed. What Dolly demonstrated was that\nit is possible to take a differentiated cell, turn back its biological\nclock, and make the cell behave as though it was a recently fertilized\negg.\n\nNuclear transfer can also be done using a donor cell from an embryo\ninstead of from an organism after birth. Cloning mammals using\nembryonic cells has been successful since the mid-1980s (for a history\nof cloning, see Wilmut et al. 2001). Another technique to produce\ngenetically identical offspring or clones is embryo twinning or embryo\nsplitting, in which an early embryo is split in vitro so that\nboth parts, when implanted in the uterus, can develop into individual\norganisms genetically identical to each other. This process occurs\nnaturally with identical twins.\n\nHowever, what many people find disturbing is the idea of creating a\ngenetic duplicate of an existing person, or a person who has existed.\nThat is why the potential application of SCNT in humans set off a\nstorm of controversy. Another way to produce a genetic duplicate from\nan existing person is by cryopreserving one of two genetically\nidentical embryos created in vitro for several years or\ndecades before using it to generate a pregnancy. Lastly, reproductive\ncloning of humans could, in theory, also be achieved by combining the\ninduced pluripotent stem cell technique with tetraploid\ncomplementation. Several research teams have succeeded in cloning mice\nthis way (see, for example, Boland et al. 2009). The technique\ninvolves injecting mouse iPS cells in tetraploid embryos, i.e. embryos\nwith twice the normal number of chromosomes that cannot result in live\noffspring. The resulting mouse pups are derived solely from the iPS\ncells, which means that the tetraploid embryos only acted as a\nsubstitute trophectoderm, which forms the placenta and other\nnourishing membranes but which does not contribute to the\n\u2018embryo proper\u2019.\n\nDolly is a case of reproductive cloning, the aim of which is to create\noffspring. Reproductive cloning is to be distinguished from cloning\nfor therapy and research, sometimes also referred to as\n\u2018therapeutic cloning\u2019. Both reproductive cloning and\ncloning for research and therapy involve SCNT, but their aims, as well\nas most of the ethical concerns they raise, differ. I will first\ndiscuss cloning for research and therapy and will then proceed to\noutline the ethical debate surrounding reproductive cloning.\n",
