    "main_text": "Active and Passive Elements of a Thought Style\n6. Active and Passive Elements of a Thought Style\n\nFleck defines a thought style as the readiness for directed\nperception, with corresponding mental and objective assimilation of\nwhat has been so perceived, characterized by specific problems of\ninterest, by judgments which the thought collective considers evident\nand by methods which are applied as a means of cognition (1935a,\nIV.3). What was collectively developed plays an active role in\ncognition: shapes modes of perception and the thinking of members of a\nthought collective. An individual, who has assimilated a certain\nthought style, becomes passive when conducting standard research:\nrecognizes in environment specific forms and draws\nspecific\u2014those and no other\u2014conclusions from an\nassimilated theory and results of experimental research.\n\nCognition therefore means, primarily, to ascertain those results that\nmust follow, given certain preconditions. The preconditions correspond\nto active linkages and constitute that portion of cognition belonging\nto the collective. The constrained results correspond to passive\nlinkages and constitute that which is experienced as objective\nreality. The act of ascertaining is the contribution of the individual\n(1935a, II.4).\n\n\nThe occurrence of passive elements cannot be explained sociologically.\nThey are, so to speak, results of employing a conceptual measure which\nresulted from historical and cultural circumstances to the results of\nexperiments\u2014which, as the title of Fleck\u2019s book says, came\nto existence together with the creation of a new though style and are\ndeveloped with it.\n\nWhat Fleck calls active elements of a thought style, Henri\nPoincar\u00e9 calls \u201cprinciples\u201d and sees as\n\u201cdisguised definitions\u201d. Poincar\u00e9 stresses that\nthere is nothing necessary in definitions\u2014they can be various\nand they are chosen for pragmatic and aesthetic reasons. Fleck agrees\nwith him to a certain extent. He notices that in the 19th century\nsyphilis was defined in many ways: as a carnal scourge, as a\nmercury-treated decease, and finally as a set of typical symptoms. And\nhe claims that \u201c(\u2026) if syphilis can be defined in various\nways, the definition selected still determines some conclusions.\n(\u2026) there are some associations which are open to choice\n(\u2026) and others that are constrained\u201d (1935a, I). For\nexample if one defined syphilis as a \u201ccarnal scourge\u201d,\nthen other diseases like gonorrhea, soft chancre, etc. would be cases\nof syphilis; and when proper experiments had been conducted one stated\nfor example that \u201csometimes mercury does not cure the carnal\nscourge but makes it even worse\u201d. Looking at the same experiment\nthose who defined syphilis as a disease which can be treated with\nmercury would conclude that they are not dealing with syphilis.\nHowever, Fleck opposes the conventionalist idea that definitions can\nbe chosen freely. Definitions are born with the birth of a thought\nstyle, and their formulation is determined by both historical-cultural\nconditioning and by the process of exchanging ideas among researchers\nwhich was described above. A mature thought style is a system where\ndefinitions mutually condition each other and where accepting a\ncertain definition can prevent accepting some other ones.\n\nThe distinction between active and passive elements is still not\nclear. Some examples are obvious: if 16 is assumed\u2014on the basis\nof some arbitrary convention\u2014as the atomic weight for oxygen,\nthe atomic weight of hydrogen will necessary be 1.008. \u201cThis\nmeans that the ratio of the two weights is a passive element of\nknowledge\u201d (1935a, IV.1). However, as an active element of\nknowledge Fleck indicates also \u201cthe mere use of alcohol in\npreparing extracts\u201d, adding however that \u201cthe actual\nusefulness of such extracts is a passive one and therefore a necessary\nconsequence\u201d. He also writes that the concepts of chemical\nelement and of atom are derived \u201cfrom collective\nimagination\u201d, but \u201cthe usefulness of these concepts in\nchemistry (\u2026) is really independent of the individual\nknower\u201d. The active and passive elements of knowledge are\ninseparable either historically or logically, and every statement can\nbe divided into active and passive part.\n\nBoth kinds of elements can be found in each thought style, and also in\nmythical and religious thinking. In one place Fleck notices that\nwhereas a myth has little passive elements, the characteristic feature\nof science is that it attempts to add as many passive elements as it\ncan to its system. Fleck never developed this idea, and this is\nunfortunate, for this could be his contribution to the solution of the\nproblem of demarcation. There are some places where he makes remarks\ncomplementing argumentation developed in the last chapter: \u201cWhat\nhas previously been classed with the passive elements of knowledge may\nlater join the active ones\u201d (1935a, IV.2). We should regret\nagain that he did not develop the idea which could contribute to\nunderstanding the mechanism of those transformations which Kuhn later\ncalled \u201cscientific revolutions\u201d. For it suggests that not\nonly pre-scientific proto-ideas, but also passive results obtained\nwithin an old scientific thought style can serve as a starting point\nfor constructing a new one.\n",
