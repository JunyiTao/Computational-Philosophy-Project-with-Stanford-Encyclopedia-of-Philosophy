    "main_text": "Erotic Art vs Pornography: Beyond Aesthetics || Erotic Art, Art History, and the Cultural History of Pornography\n4.1 Erotic Art, Art History, and the Cultural History of Pornography\n\nArt historians who write about erotic art are often quite anxious to\ndraw a strict dividing line between \u201chigh brow\u201d erotic art\nand \u201clow brow\u201d pornography. Kenneth Clark, mentioned\nearlier, famously stated to the Longford Committee Investigating\nPornography:\n\n\nTo my mind art exists in the realm of contemplation \u2026 the\nmoment art becomes an incentive to action it loses its true character.\n(Longford 1972: 280)\n\n\nThis was his main objection to pornography: that it was in essence an\nincentive to sexual acts. However, as a justification for the radical\nseparation of art and pornography this will not do. For one thing,\nClark seems to overlook the fact that there are numerous religious or\npolitically inspired masterpieces that call on people to change their\nlives or perform certain actions (the Isenheim\nAltarpiece, 1512\u201316, or Delacroix\u2019s\nLiberty Leading the People,\n1830, come to mind).\n\nThis brings us to another rationale for separating erotic art and\npornography that is very popular among art historians (and is somewhat\nreminiscent of Dutton\u2019s expressed reservations towards eroticism\nin art). Art is necessarily multi-layered, it is argued, whereas\npornography is one-dimensional; it has only one job to do and\ntherefore lacks the formal and structural intricacy, the cognitive\ncomplexity, and interpretive openness of art (see, for example, Webb\n1975: 6; Mahon 2005: 14; Wallace et al. 2007: 15). But while the\nIsenheim Altarpiece and Liberty Leading the People\nmay indeed be very complex works, there is good reason to believe that\nthe insistence on the simplicity of pornography is itself the result\nof an oversimplification. Let us examine this claim in more\ndetail.\n\n(1) A simple purpose? It is tempting to think of pornography\nas having only one, very rudimentary purpose: sexual arousal of the\naudience. But a look at very early pornographic works, those that were\nproduced in France and England between 1500 and 1800, shows how\nmisleading that conception is. Almost all pornographic works of that\nera deliberately used the shock of sex to criticize religious and\npolitical authorities (Hunt 1996: 35). With their truth-telling trope\nthey were meant to function as a powerful antidote to the many forms\nof repression in society and often had the explicit aim to educate\npeople about politics, religion, society, and of course, sex (Lubey\n2022). It is not a coincidence that these books were known in 18th\ncentury France as \u201clivres philosophiques\u201d (they were\nconsidered just as dangerous to society as philosophical treatises)\nand that the rise in pornography around 1740 coincided with the\nhey-day of the Enlightenment (Hunt 1996; Darnton 1995). Quite a few of\nthe pornographic novels of that time even carried the term\n\u201cphilosophy\u201d in the title (think of Sade\u2019s\nLa Philosophie dans le Boudoir,\n1795) and some of them were actually written by prominent\nphilosophers who were keen to use this extremely popular genre to\ndivulge some of their ideas to the masses (think of Diderot\u2019s\nLes Bijoux Indiscrets,\n1748).\n\nIn one of the most notorious examples of the genre, Th\u00e9r\u00e8se\nPhilosophe (1748),\nwritten by the philosopher Jean-Baptiste de Boyer, Marquis\nd\u2019Argens, a great variety of copulations is used to communicate\nwhat is in essence a materialist and mechanistic metaphysics. In\nanonymous bedrooms, bodies brought together by individual need and\ninterest collide just like the atoms of the natural philosophers\n(Jacob 1996: 160). And the bodies themselves are described as machines\npowered by the relentless motion inherent in matter, by passions they\ncannot control:\n\n\nThe arrangement of our organs, the disposition of our fibers, a\ncertain movement of our fluids, all determine the type of passions\nwhich work upon us, directing our reason and our will in the smallest\nas well as the greatest actions we perform. (Th\u00e9r\u00e8se\nPhilosophe, excerpted in Darnton 1995: 100)\n\n\nOr, as the main character herself observes:\n\n\nMen and women couple like machines. Love for them is a tingling in the\nepidermis, a surge of liquids, a rush of particles through the fibers,\nand nothing more. (Th\u00e9r\u00e8se Philosophe,\nexcerpted in Leemans 2002: 257)\n\n\n(2) Formal and structural simplicity? Pornography of the\nenlightenment era also serves to tackle another misconception. It has\nbeen argued that, because the main aim of pornographers is to sexually\narouse the audience, they are forced to include as many sexually\nexplicit scenes as possible, leaving precious little room for plot\ndevelopment or formal intricacies (Steiner 1975). The pornographer\n\u201cconcocts no better than a crude excuse for a beginning; and\nonce having begun, it goes on and on and ends nowhere\u201d (Sontag\n1994: 39). Pornography, as Adorno already noted, lacks the\nbeginning-middle-end form characteristic of literature (Sontag 1994:\n39). Yet, again, this gives us far from a waterproof criterion for\ndistinguishing erotic literature from pornography. For instance, the\nstructural complexity of the pornographic novel, Histoire\nde Dom B\u2026 Portier des Chartreux\n(1741), with its embedded stories and variety of narrators, has\noften been noted by scholars (Frappier-Mazur 1996: 211). The careful\ncomposition of Th\u00e9r\u00e8se, where the author has\narranged the parts to maximize the refraction, so that wherever the\nreader turns he seems to see throbbing sexuality, provides another\ncounterexample (Darnton 1995).\n\n(3) One-dimensional in its effect on the audience? It could\nbe thought that sexual arousal is such a powerful, bodily state that\nit must block out all other functions, most notably our cognitive\nfaculties. Levinson claims that this is precisely what distinguishes\nsexual arousal from sexual stimulation, which he thinks is\nnot incompatible with the cognitive activity required for\naesthetic appreciation (2005: 232). Other philosophers have challenged\nthis controversial distinction (Blackburn 2006: 52; Maes 2012).\nMoreover, even if one were to accept the animal-like nature of sexual\narousal, that does not mean that it cannot be cognitively rewarding\nand artistically appropriate. As one commentator of Cleland\u2019s\nFanny Hill notes:\n\n\nThe stimulus of reading a scene in Fanny Hill makes in the\nreader\u2019s own nature the point made in the text. The reader may\nbe moved to reconsider the merits of stoicism, revaluate the powers of\nthe mind to control the body, reread his Descartes and think again of\nthe dividing line between mind and the b\u00eate-machine. (Braudy\n1991: 85)\n\n\n(4) Simple to interpret? While questions of interpretation\narise frequently in relation to works of erotic art, people rarely\nseem to have interpretive qualms where pornography is concerned.\nIndeed, if an interpretation typically attempts to account for those\nelements in a work whose presence is not immediately obvious to the\ntarget audience (Carroll 2009), there may seem no need for an\ninterpretation in the case of pornography since it is all too obvious\nwhy such films or novels include one sexually explicit scene after\nanother. Still, here too it is important not to jump to conclusions.\nThere are (at least) two different kinds of interpretative projects\none could engage in, each with its own set of lead questions.\n\u201cWhat is the work about?\u201d is one question one could ask.\nAnother question is \u201cWhat does the work reveal about the author\nor the time, place, culture, society in which it was made?\u201d\nWhile the former is central to the discipline of art criticism, the\nlatter question will usually be the starting point of interpretations\noffered by cultural historians, sociologists, psychoanalysts. These\nlatter interpretations, where pornography is concerned, will be\neverything but simple given the incredible complexity of the\npornographic landscape with its huge catalogue of taboos, body types,\nsex acts, and other things that get people\u2019s blood flowing.\nPornography offers us, in the words of Laura Kipnis, \u201cthe royal\nroad to the cultural psyche\u201d (2006: 118) and as such can prove\nto be a gold mine for interpretations. The other question\u2014What\nis the work about?\u2014seems less pertinent, especially in relation\nto the formulaic and repetitive video clips one finds on porn\nwebsites. Nevertheless, there are other types of pornography where\nissues about meaning and \u201caboutness\u201d do seem highly\nrelevant, such as the philosophical pornography mentioned above and\nthe feminist pornography that will be discussed in the next\nsection.\n\nIn closing, it is worth mentioning a thesis recently put forward by\nEaton (2018), based on art historical considerations regarding the\nfunction of erotic images in 16th-century Italy. Eaton argues that the\nroot of the erotic art/pornography distinction was\u2014at least in\nthat particular context\u2014class. The need for a special category\nof unsanctioned illicit images arose at the very time when print\nculture was beginning to threaten elite privilege. What made an erotic\nrepresentation exceed the boundaries of acceptability, Eaton suggests,\nwas not its extreme libidinosity but, rather, its widespread\navailability and, thereby, its threat to one of the mechanisms of\nsustaining class privilege.\n",
