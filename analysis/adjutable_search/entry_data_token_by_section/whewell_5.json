    "main_text": "The Relation Between Scientific Practice, History of Science, and Philosophy of Science\n6. Moral Philosophy\n\nWhewell\u2019s moral philosophy was criticized by Mill as being\n\u201cintuitionist\u201d (see Mill 1852). Whewell\u2019s moral\nphilosophy is intuitionist in the sense of claiming that\nhumans possess a faculty (\u201cconscience\u201d) which enables them\nto discern directly what is morally right or wrong. Yet his view\ndiffers from that of earlier philosophers such as Shaftesbury and\nHutcheson, who claimed that this faculty is akin to our sense organs\nand thus spoke of conscience as a \u201cmoral sense.\u201d\nWhewell\u2019s position is more similar to that of intuitionists such\nas Cudworth and Clarke, who claimed that our moral faculty is reason.\nWhewell maintained that there is no separate moral faculty,\nbut rather that conscience is just \u201creason exercised on moral\nsubjects.\u201d Because of this, Whewell referred to moral rules as\n\u201cprinciples of reason\u201d and described the discovery of\nthese rules as an activity of reason (see 1864, 23\u20134). These\nmoral rules \u201care primary principles, and are established in our\nminds simply by a contemplation of our moral nature and condition; or,\nwhat expresses the same thing, by intuition\u201d (1846, 11). Yet,\nwhat he meant by \u201cintuition\u201d was not a non-rational mental\nprocess, as Mill claimed. On Whewell\u2019s view, the contemplation\nof the moral principles is conceived as a rational process. Whewell\nnoted that \u201cCertain moral principles being, as we\u2019ve said,\nthus seen to be true by intuition, under due conditions of reflection\nand thought, are unfolded into their application by further reflection\nand thought\u201d(1864, 12\u201313). Morality requires rules because\nreason is our distinctive property, and \u201cReason directs us to\nRules\u201d (1864, 45). Whewell\u2019s morality, then, does not have\none problem associated with the moral sense intuitionists. For the\nmoral sense intuitionist, the process of decision-making is\nnon-rational; just as we feel the rain on our skin by a non-rational\nprocess, we just feel what the right action is. This is often\nconsidered the major difficulty with the intuitionist view: if the\ndecision is merely a matter of intuition, it seems that there can be\nno way to settle disputes over how we ought to act. However, Whewell\nnever suggested that decision-making in morality is a non-rational\nprocess. On the contrary, he believed that reason leads to common\ndecisions about the right way to act (although our desires/affections\nmay get in the way): he explained \u201cSo far as men decide\nconformably to Reason, they decide alike\u201d (see 1864, 43). Thus\nthe decision on how we ought to act should be made by reason, and so\nmoral disputes can be settled rationally on Whewell\u2019s view.\n\nMill also criticized Whewell\u2019s claim that moral rules are\nnecessary truths which are self-evident. Mill took this to mean that\nthere can be no progress in morality\u2014what is self-evident must\nalways remain so\u2014and thus to the further conclusion that Whewell\nbelieved the current rules of society to be necessary truths. Such a\nview would tend to support the status quo, as Mill rightly complained.\n(Thus he, rather unfairly. accused Whewell of justifying evil\npractices such as cruelty to animals, forced marriages, and even\nslavery.) But Mill was wrong to attribute such a view to Whewell.\nWhewell did claim that moral rules are necessary truths, and invested\nthem with the epistemological status of self-evident\n\u201caxioms\u201d (see 1864, 58). However, as noted above,\nWhewell\u2019s view of necessary truth is a progressive one. This is\nas much the case in morality as in science. The realm of morality,\nlike the realm of physical science, is structured by certain\nFundamental Ideas: in this case, Benevolence, Justice, Truth, Purity,\nand Order (see 1852, xxiii). These moral ideas are conditions of our\nmoral experience; they enable us to perceive actions as being in\naccordance with the demands of morality. Like the ideas of the\nphysical sciences, the ideas of morality must be explicated before the\nmoral rules can be derived from them (see 1860a, 388). There is a\nprogressive intuition of necessary truth in morality as well as in\nscience. Hence it does not follow that because the moral truths are\naxiomatic and self-evident that we currently know them (see 1846,\n38\u20139). Indeed, Whewell claimed that \u201cto test self-evidence\nby the casual opinion of individual men, is a\nself-contradiction\u201d (1846, 35). Nevertheless, Whewell did\nbelieve that we can look to the dictates of positive law of the most\n\u201cmorally advanced\u201d societies as a starting point in our\nexplication of the moral ideas. Although he surely had a biased view\nof what societies were \u201cmorally advanced,\u201d he was not\ntherefore suggesting that the laws of those societies are the standard\nof morality. Just as we examine the phenomena of the physical world in\norder to explicate our scientific conceptions, we can examine the\nfacts of positive law and the history of moral philosophy in order to\nexplicate our moral conceptions. Only when these conceptions are\nexplicated can we see what axioms or necessary truths of morality\ntruly follow from them. Mill was therefore wrong to interpret\nWhewell\u2019s moral philosophy as a justification of the status quo\nor as constituting a \u201cvicious circle.\u201d Rather,\nWhewell\u2019s view shares some features of Rawls\u2019s later use\nof the notion of \u201creflective equilibrium.\u201d (For more on\nWhewell\u2019s moral philosophy, and his debate with Mill over\nmorality, see Snyder 2006, chapter four.)\n",
