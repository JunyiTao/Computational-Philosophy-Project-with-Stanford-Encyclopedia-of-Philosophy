    "main_text": "Naturalness and other notions || Universals and tropes\n4.5 Universals and tropes\n\nArmstrong\n (1978)\n developed an influential theory of \u201cuniversals\u201d (a\ncategory he subdivides into properties and relations) which was\ndistinctive for its emphasis on the idea that universals are\n\u201csparse\u201d by comparison with predicates: for example,\nArmstrong refuses to posit disjunctions of universals. Lewis\n (1999,\n 1) credits Armstrong with convincing him that the concept of\nnaturalness is \u201ccommonsensical and serviceable\u201d. Lewis is\nopen to a view that posits Armstrong-style universals in addition to\nproperties and relations conceived of as \u201cabundant\u201d, and\nanalyses \u2018perfectly natural property\u2019 as \u2018property\ncorresponding to some universal\u2019, i.e.\u00a0as \u2018property\nthat is the property of instantiating \\(u\\) for some\nuniversal \\(u\\)\u2019. \n\nThis analysis has some surprising consequences when combined with\ncertain other commitments of Armstrong\u2019s view. For example,\nArmstrong holds that any two universals have a conjunction, which he\nidentifies with their mereological fusion. Given the proposed\nanalysis, this entails that the conjunction of any two perfectly\nnatural properties is itself perfectly\n natural.[41]\n This conflicts with the claim that no perfectly natural property\nsupervenes on all the rest. If one wanted to hold on to that claim,\none might instead analyse \u2018perfectly natural property\u2019 as\n\u2018property corresponding to some mereologically simple\n universal\u2019.[42]\n Note however that for Armstrong it is an open question whether there\nare any mereologically simple universals, and thus whether the\nproperties corresponding to mereologically simple universals form a\nsupervenience base for everything.\n\nArmstrong also posits a wide array of \u201cstructural\u201d\nuniversals: for example, given any universal property \\(u_1\\) and\nbinary universal relation \\(u_2\\), Armstrong would hold that if there\nare any fusions of two non-overlapping objects individually\ninstantiating \\(u_1\\) and jointly instantiating \\(u_2\\), there is a\nuniversal \\(u_3\\) that is necessarily instantiated by all and only\nsuch fusions. If the perfectly natural properties are those that\ncorrespond to universals, this view will lead to a great profusion of\nperfectly natural properties. This fits poorly with intuitive\njudgments of relative naturalness like those elicited by our initial\nexamples, and threatens to disrupt several of the theoretical roles\nfor naturalness (Sider\n 1995,\n 3). Lewis\n (1986a)\n argues (not on those grounds) that theorists of universals should not\nposit structural universals.\n\nLewis was also open to the program of analysing naturalness in terms\nof tropes\u2014\u201cparticularised property\ninstances\u201d like Socrates\u2019 paleness or\nAntony\u2019s love of Cleopatra (see the entry on\n tropes).\n Lewis suggests that given a \u201csparse\u201d theory of tropes\n(which would deny the existence of tropes like Socrates\u2019s\nbeing either pale or flushed) and a modal realist ontology, one\ncould define a perfectly natural property as one such that, for some\nmaximal set of duplicate tropes, its instances are exactly the things\nthat instantiate some member of that set (in the sense of\n\u2018instantiate\u2019 on which Socrates instantiates\nSocrates\u2019 paleness). To avoid circularity,\n\u2018duplicate\u2019 here had better not be analysed in terms of\nsharing of perfectly natural properties. By contrast with the case of\nuniversals, it is not so easy for opponents of Lewisian modal realism\nto take over this account. The most straightforward approach would\nreplace the dyadic \u2018duplicate\u2019 with a four-place predicate\n\u2018\\(t_1\\) in \\(w_1\\) is a duplicate of \\(t_2\\) in \\(w_2\\)\u2019;\nbut treating this as primitive seems even more unsatisfactory than\ntreating the dyadic \u2018duplicate\u2019 as primitive.\n",
