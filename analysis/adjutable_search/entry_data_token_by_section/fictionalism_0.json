    "main_text": "Brief History and Overview\n1. Brief History and Overview\n\nSome historically especially important precursors to modern\nfictionalism are Jeremy Bentham (see Ogden 1932), who defended the\nview that many entities referred to in ordinary discourse are\n\u201cfictitious\u201d, Hans Vaihinger, with his philosophy of the\n\u201cas if\u201d, and, specifically in the moral case, Friedrich\nNietzsche, whose view has been argued to amount to moral fictionalism.\nVoltaire\u2019s famous \u201cIf God did not exist, it would be\nnecessary to invent him\u201d can be seen as expressing a\nfictionalist stance toward theism. Moreover, George Berkeley\u2019s\nadvice to think with the learned and speak with the vulgar is often\ntaken to express a fictionalist stance (from \u00a751 of A\nTreatise Concerning the Principles of Human Knowledge, defending\nhis immaterialism from the charge that it does not fit the way we\nspeak). Sometimes Hume is mentioned as an early fictionalist (see for\nexample Varzi 2013). There are arguably earlier predecessors as well.\nOne possible example is the Pyrrhonist view that we should live\nwithout belief (see Sextus Empiricus, \u201cOutlines of\nScepticism\u201d). Moreover, the doctrine of the two truths in\nBuddhist philosophy has been interpreted as a distinction between\nfictional truth and real truth (see Garfield 2006). Pierre Duhem\n(1913) argues that the dominant view on astronomy before the advent of\nmodern physics was that a fictionalist attitude was appropriate. For\nsome discussion of these historical precursors, see Gideon Rosen\n(2005) (for a discussion of Pyrrhonism, the early history of\nastronomy, and Bentham), Arthur Fine (1993) (for a discussion of\nVaihinger), and Nadeem Hussain (2007) (for a discussion of Nietzsche\nand other 19th century German philosophers with fictionalist\ntendencies).\n\nMore recently, Hartry Field (1980 and 1989), Joseph Melia (e.g. 2000),\nMark Balaguer (e.g. 1998) and Stephen Yablo (see especially 2000a,\n2000b, 2001 and 2002) have defended fictionalism about mathematical\ndiscourse (see here the entry on\n fictionalism in the philosophy of mathematics);\n Bas van Fraassen (1980) has defended a version of fictionalism about\nscientific theories; Richard Joyce (2001, 2005), Mark Kalderon (2005a)\nand Daniel Nolan, Greg Restall and Caroline West (2005) have defended\nmoral fictionalism; Kendall Walton (1985, 1990 , 2000), Mark Crimmins\n(1998), Stuart Brock (2002), Mark Balaguer (1998a), Anthony Everett\n(2005), and Frederick Kroon (2000, 2004) have defended fictionalism\nabout things like negative existentials, identity statements,\npropositional attitude reports, and fictional characters; Peter van\nInwagen (1990) and Cian Dorr and Gideon Rosen (2002) have defended\nfictionalism about ordinary object discourse; Bradley Armour-Garb and\nJames Woodbridge (2015) and Alexis Burgess and John Burgess (2011)\nhave defended fictionalism about truth; and D.M. Armstrong (1989),\nGideon Rosen (1990), John Nolt (1986), Seahwa Kim (2005) and John\nDivers (1999) have defended modal fictionalism (see here the entry on\n modal fictionalism).\n Needless to say, this is a just a sample of recent defenses of\nfictionalist views. The present entry will be more focused on\nfictionalism as a general strategy in philosophy than on fictionalism\nabout specific discourses. For some recent overviews of fictionalism,\nsee Kroon (2011), Caddick Bourne (2013), Divers and Liggins (2005),\nSainsbury (2010), and the full-length book on fictionalism Kroon,\nMcKeown-Green and Brock (2018). Important collections of texts on\nfictionalism are Kalderon (2005b) and Armour-Garb and Kroon\n(forthcoming). \n",
