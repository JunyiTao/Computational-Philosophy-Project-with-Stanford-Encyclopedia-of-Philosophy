During Ramus\u2019 early years at the University of\nParis he devoted himself to the disciplines or arts of the traditional\ntrivium: grammar, rhetoric and dialectic. He formulated his\nideas on logic in 1540s and the early 1550s, and it is during this\nperiod that he gave most explicit expression to his\nanti-Aristotelianism. In 1555 he published a logic textbook in French,\nentitled Dialectique, which in many ways provided a clear\nindication of his ambitions and aims. Although he had become well\nknown for his Latin eloquence, he broke with the scholastic tradition\nby writing in the vernacular. The following year he published the same\nbook in Latin under the title Dialecticae libri duo\n(henceforth Dialectica). It was later printed in many\ndifferent languages, and hundreds of editions of the Latin version\nwere published. The book was widely disseminated and used at schools\nand universities throughout Europe, mostly in the Protestant\ncountries.\n\nRamus\u2019 rhetoric textbook, the Institutiones rhetoricae,\nwritten with Talon, appeared in 1545 but with only Talon\u2019s name\non the title-page. It was a kind of companion to the Dialecticae\ninstitutiones, published two years earlier. A second edition,\nentitled Rhetorica, though popular and frequently reprinted\nin new editions, never attained the diffusion and influence of his\nlogic textbook. During the late 1550s and the 1560s Ramus published\nhis lectures on the various arts, including physics and metaphysics.\nWhile his textbooks were succinctly organized according to very strict\nprinciples, the lectures (Scholae) were less laconic and\noffered more detailed discussion. They were later collected together\nand published as Scholae in liberales artes in a Basel\nedition of 1569.\n\nRamus also turned his hand to mathematics, although his knowledge of\nthe subject was limited. He had problems at first understanding the\nGreek mathematicians, and later he recalled his early encounter with\nthem: \n\n\n\u2026I threw away my drawing-board and ruler, and burst out in rage\nagainst mathematics, because it tortures so cruelly those who love it\nand are eager for it. (Nancelius Petri Rami Vita: 205) \n\n\nAccording to Nancelius, Ramus used to gather around him in his own\nhouse a number of proficient mathematicians, so that they could help\nhim to understand what he would later teach his students. Yet, from\nthe very beginning, he was convinced of the importance of mathematics.\nNancelius thinks his master\u2019s keen interest in mathematics was a\nconsequence of his banishment for some time from teaching philosophy\n(Ramus, Collectaneae praefationes, epistolae, orationes, p.\n409; Nancelius Petri Rami Vita: 197\u2013201; Goulding 2006:\n74, 2010: 20). In any case, he improved his abilities in both Greek\nand mathematics, and in his will he stipulated that the holder of the\nchair he wanted to endow should be an expert in both. Ong\u2019s\nnegative judgment of Ramus\u2019 mathematical abilities may be\ncorrect (Ong 1958: 27); nevertheless, his enthusiasm for this field\nwas crucial to the future history of Ramism.\n\nWhatever Ramus\u2019 own mathematical abilities may have been, he\nconsistently demonstrated his conviction of its importance. He was\nconfident that there was a natural way to think and argue and also to\ncalculate. Arts should therefore always be built of parts that\nrepresent this true nature. Mathematics should mirror a natural\nmathematical thinking. We will see below how significant this thought\nwas for Ramus when he worked out his syllabus and his method.\n\nRamus addressed the challenge of his weak knowledge of mathematics not\nonly by improving his ability but also by grasping its history. It\nbecame essential for him not only to distinguish those who in the past\nhad contributed to make mathematics an art but also those who in\ndifferent ways had tried to undermine it. In his early writings, he\nseems mostly to have been focused on the natural aspects of\nmathematics and looked on it as an expression of natural dialectic;\nbut later on he turned his attention more to the practical or useful\naspects of mathematics. Goulding has explained this development in\ndetail, outlining how Ramus\u2019 evaluation of Pythagoras evolved\nover time, until he eventually became more and more like Ramus\nhimself. He even condemned the way Euclid had, in his view, destroyed\nwhat was natural in mathematics and instead filled it with subtleties.\nIn the Prooemium mathematicum (1667) and later in Scholae\nmathematicae, he criticized the theoretical works of the ancient\nGreek mathematicians on the grounds that they were confusing and led\naway from the usefulness of the discipline for practitioners. He\nwanted \u201can art at once practical and methodical\u201d. As\nGoulding points out, if the holder of his endowed chair of mathematics\nwas to be in a position to observe the provisions of his will, he\nwould have to be made in Ramus\u2019 own image (Goulding 2010: 35f.,\n50 and 180).\n\nThus, while the early phase of Ramus\u2019 academic career was\nconcentrated on the disciplines of the trivium, in the later\nperiod, from around 1560, he moved on to the quadrivium\n(arithmetic, geometry, music and astronomy), though in practice his\ninterest was largely restricted to mathematics. He could never fully\nendorse Copernicus\u2019 new heliocentric astronomy because he was\nunable to accept an hypothesis as a scientific argument (see\n \u00a72.4\n below). The famous Danish astronomer Tycho Brahe (1546\u20131601)\nleft a report of an encounter he had with Ramus in Augsburg in 1569,\nregistering his own amazement at this attitude. It was Brahe\u2019s\nview that, according to Ramus, the astronomer\u2019s task in\ndescribing the movements of the planets must be based solely on\nobservation: he was not allowed to use hypotheses such as assuming a\ncircular planetary movement. Ramus even promised to let anyone who\ncould create an astronomy without hypotheses take over his own royal\nchair. Of course, no one seriously claimed to have succeeded until\nKepler in 1597 mockingly declared himself entitled to it (Skalnik\n2002: 59; Hooykaas 1958: 64\u201367; Jardine & Segonds 2001).\n\nAlthough Ramus challenged the values and educational principles of\nscholasticism, he never attempted to discuss theological issues. His\nsole interest was in reforming the curriculum of the arts faculty.\nNancelius points out that Ramus\u2019 large library had very few\nvolumes on theology, medicine or law (Nancelius Petri Rami\nVita: 273). Nevertheless, during his final years he wrote a book\non Christian theology, the Commentariorum de religione Christiana\nlibri quatuor, which was published posthumously. The most\nstriking feature of this work was that Ramus defined theology as the\nart of living virtuously, ars bene vivendi, adopting an\nessentially Zwinglian point of view. Theology may give us the rules by\nmeans of which we can and must live, but it cannot bring us salvation.\nIn a particularly interesting chapter of the treatise (I:8), Ramus\ndiscusses the meaning of predestination. Mostly he sided with a\nZwinglian against a Genevan position, as he did in the sacramental\ntheology.\n\nBanosius mentions that several of Ramus\u2019 manuscripts were\ndestroyed or scattered at the time of his murder and that among these\nwere a commentary on Aristotle\u2019s Politics and various\nworks on ethics and music (Banosius 1577: 39). Unfortunately, no trace\nof these writings has survived. Nancelius was eager to mention that he\nhad collaborated with Ramus in planning a long series of works on\nmathematics. For some reason, however, this corpus\nmathematicum was never printed and, along with many other\nmanuscripts, these works disappeared after Ramus\u2019 assassination\n(Nancelius Petri Rami Vita: 205 and 273 ).\n",
