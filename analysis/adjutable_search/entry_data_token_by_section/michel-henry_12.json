    "main_text": "Ethics and Political Philosophy || Christian Ethics as Recognition of Absolute Life\n4.3 Christian Ethics as Recognition of Absolute Life\n\nHenry\u2019s reading of Christian ethics in I Am the Truth\nconfirms that what is at stake for the ethics of affectivity is the\nrecognition of the bond between individual and absolute life. For\nHenry, cultural renaissance is therefore inherently religious and is\nconnected to the theme of \u201csecond birth\u201d. In I am the\nTruth, as in Incarnation, the opposition of\n\u201cbarbarism\u201d and culture remains operative. As an example,\nHenry considers the negation of God in the world of techno-science to\nbe implied by the negation of the human as living ipseity (IAT 263),\nsince \u201cpractices of barbarism\u201d impair the subjective need\nfor action, in which the human is able to experience life as an\nabsolute. Paradoxically, the search for oneself in the world, which\naccording to Henry characterizes modernity, can only be overcome by\nabandoning oneself to absolute life, i.e., by renouncing the care for\noneself in the world (souci de soi dans le monde) (IAT\n143\u2013144). Not to care anymore about oneself as worldly ego means\n\u201cto be only a living that is traversed by Life\u201d (DD 169),\ni.e., to rediscover what was previously forgotten, namely absolute\nlife, and to live from the infinite love that the absolute has for\nitself. In order to account for this \u201csecond birth\u201d, Henry\nexplicitly refers to a teleology oriented toward the\nrecognition of absolute life. Eventually, such recognition expresses\nitself through a double negation in which what negates the absolute is\nnegated in return. But, being immanent and affective, this recognition\nalso resists its description and escapes representation. \u201cSecond\nbirth\u201d is only possible within subjective praxis and, more\nprecisely, through the work of mercy, since \n\n\nonly the work of mercy practices the forgetting of self in which,\nall interest for the Self (right down to the idea of what we call a\nself or a me) now removed, no obstacle is now posed to the unfurling\nof life in this Self extended to its original essence. (IAT 170)\n\n\n\nHowever, it is through the action of immanent life itself that\n\u201cthe life of the ego is changed into Life of the absolute\u201d\n(IAT 165). Consequently, such a mutation of praxis can only be an\ninterior one, which means that it can never be commanded from a point\nof view exterior to immanent affectivity or even be the result of the\nego\u2019s conscious caring for salvation. This point is not\nunproblematic for an ethics of affectivity, since what has been\nidentified as its fundamental issue depends not primarily on\ndecisions consciously put into action, but on the immanent dynamic of\naffectivity itself.\n",
