    "main_text": "Some Families of Solutions || Inconsistency views\n5. Concluding Remarks\n\nThere is much more to say about the Liar paradox than we have covered\nhere: there are more approaches to the Liar variants we have\nmentioned, and more related paradoxes like those of denotation,\nproperties, etc. There are also more important technical results, and\nmore important philosophical implications and applications. Our goal\nhere has been to be more suggestive than exhaustive, and we hope to\nhave given the reader an indication of what the Liar paradox is, and\nwhat its consequences might be.\n",
