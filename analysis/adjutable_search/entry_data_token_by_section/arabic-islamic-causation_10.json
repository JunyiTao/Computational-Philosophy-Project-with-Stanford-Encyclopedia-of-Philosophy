As we have seen,\nAristotelian natural philosophy relies in part on repeated observation\nin its attribution of causal powers to natural bodies. Ash\u02bfarite\ntheologians attack this aspect of Aristotelian natural philosophy on\nthe ground that repeated observation of concomitance is not evidence\nof causation. A version of this argument appears in\nal-Ghaz\u0101l\u012b\u2019s Incoherence of the\nPhilosophers.\n\nAl-Ghaz\u0101l\u012b distinguishes a few different positions held by\nhis philosopher opponents. One position considers changes in nature to\nbe brought about by natural bodies alone, without any contribution by\nGod. Applied to the example of the burning of the cotton, this\nposition holds that\n\n\nthe agent of the burning is the fire alone, it being an agent by\nnature [and] not by choice\u2014hence, incapable of refraining from\n[acting according to] what is in its nature after contacting a\nsubstratum receptive of it. (al-Ghaz\u0101l\u012b IP: 167)\n\n\nAgainst this position, al-Ghaz\u0101l\u012b maintains that\n\n\n[t]he one who enacts the burning by creating blackness in the cotton,\n[causing] separation in its parts, and making it cinder or ashes is\nGod, either through the mediation of His angels or without mediation.\n(al-Ghaz\u0101l\u012b IP: 167)\n\n\nIn support of this view, he argues as follows:\n\n\nAs for fire, which is inanimate, it has no action. For what proof is\nthere that it is the agent [of the burning of cotton]? They have no\nproof other than observing the occurrence of the burning at the\n[juncture of] contact with the fire. (al-Ghaz\u0101l\u012b IP:\n167)\n\n\nAl-Ghaz\u0101l\u012b appeals to a point also made by his\nAsh\u02bfarite predecessors: we observe not that fire burns cotton but\nrather that cotton burns when in contact with fire. So, the evidence\nof repeated observation, even when unvarying, does not show that fire\nis the agent of the change. Furthermore, this evidence is consistent\nwith God\u2019s being the agent of the change.\n",
