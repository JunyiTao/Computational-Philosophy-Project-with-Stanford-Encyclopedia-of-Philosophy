    "main_text": "The Classical Problem of Fitness\n1. The Classical Problem of Fitness\n \n\nThe leading idea of Darwin\u2019s theory of natural selection is\noften expressed in terms first coined by Herbert Spencer as the claim\nthat among competing organisms the fittest survive (1864, 144). If\nthere is random variation among the traits of organisms, and if some\nvariant traits fortuitously confer advantages on the organisms that\nbear them, i.e., enhance their fitness, then those organisms will live\nto have more offspring, which in turn will bear the advantageous\ntraits. Whence descent with adaptive modification, i.e.,\nevolution. Evolution by random heritable variation and natural\nselection will explain ever increasing adaptation to given\nenvironments, increasing diversity in the occupation of new\nenvironments, and the complexity of organisms and their parts as their\nlineages adapt to one another and to their environments.\n\n\nBut what is fitness and how can one tell when a trait enhances\nfitness, or more to the point, when one organism is fitter than\nanother? Opponents of the theory of natural selection have long\nclaimed that the theory is so treated by its proponents as to define\nfitness in terms of rates of reproduction, thus condemning the\nprinciple of the survival of the fittest to triviality: the claim that\nthose organisms with higher rates of reproduction leave more offspring\nis an empty, unfalsifiable tautology bereft of explanatory power. In\nthe century and a half since the publication of On the Origin of\nSpecies biologists have all too often reinforced this objection\nby actually so defining fitness. For example, C.H. Waddington writes,\nin Towards a Theoretical Biology (1968, 19), that the fittest\nindividuals are those that are \u201cmost effective in leaving\ngametes to the next generation.\u201d It appears therefore that\nevolutionary theory requires a definition of fitness that will protect\nit from the charges of tautology, triviality, unfalsifiabilty, and\nconsequent explanatory infirmity. If no such definition is in fact\nforthcoming, then what is required by the theory\u2019s adherents is\nan alternative account of its structure and content or its role in the\nresearch program of biology.\n",
