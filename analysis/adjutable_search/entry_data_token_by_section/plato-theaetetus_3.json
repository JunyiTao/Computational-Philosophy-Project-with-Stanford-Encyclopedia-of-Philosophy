The Introduction to the Dialogue: 142a\u2013145e\n\n\nWe should not miss the three philosophical theses that are explicitly\nadvanced in the Introduction. They are offered without argument by\nSocrates, and agreed to without argument by Theaetetus, at\n145d7\u2013145e5: \n\nThe wise are wise sophiai (=  by/ because of/ in\nrespect of/ as a result of wisdom:145d11).\nTo learn is to become wiser about the topic you are learning\nabout (145d8\u20139).\nWisdom (sophia) and knowledge\n(epist\u00eam\u00ea) are the same thing (145e5).\n\n\n\nAll three theses might seem contentious today. (1) seems to allude to\nPhaedo 100e\u2019s notorious thesis about the role of the Form of\nF-ness in any x\u2019s being F\u2014that\nx is F \u201cby the Form of\nF-ness.\u201d (2) looks contentious because it implies (3);\nand (3) brings me to a second question about 142a\u2013145e (which is also\nan important question about the whole dialogue): What is the meaning\nof the Greek word that I am translating as \u201cknowledge,\u201d\nepist\u00eam\u00ea?\n\n\nMuch has been written about Plato\u2019s words for knowledge. One important\nquestion raised by Runciman 1962 is the question whether Plato was\naware of the commonplace modern distinction between knowing that,\nknowing how, and knowing what (or whom). Nothing is more natural for\nmodern philosophers than to contrast knowledge of\nobjects (knowledge by acquaintance or objectual knowledge;\nFrench conna\u00eetre) with knowledge of how to do\nthings (technique knowledge), and with knowledge of\npropositions or facts (propositional knowledge; French\nsavoir). Runciman doubts that Plato is aware of this\nthreefold distinction (1962, 17): \u201cAt the time of writing the\nTheaetetus Plato had made no clear distinction [between]\nknowing that, knowing how, and knowing by acquaintance.\u201d\n\n\nAgainst this, Plato\u2019s word for knowing how is surely\ntekhn\u00ea, from which we get the English word\n\u201ctechnique.\u201d Plato obviously thinks tekhn\u00ea\nincidental to a serious discussion of epist\u00eam\u00ea.\nThis is part of the point of the argument against definition by\nexamples that begins at 146d (cp. 177c\u2013179b).\n\n\nAs for the difference between knowing that and knowledge by\nacquaintance: the Theaetetus does mix passages that discuss\nthe one sort of knowledge with passages that discuss the other. This\ndoes not imply that Plato was unaware of the difference. Perhaps he\nwants to discuss theories of knowledge that find deep conceptual\nconnections between the two sorts of knowledge.\n\n\nA grammatical point is relevant here. The objectual \u201cI know\nSocrates\u201d in classical Greek is oida (or\ngign\u00f4sk\u00f4) ton S\u00f4krat\u00ean; the\npropositional \u201cI know Socrates is wise\u201d is oida\n(or gign\u00f4sk\u00f4) ton S\u00f4krat\u00ean sophon\nonta, literally \u201cI know Socrates being wise\u201d or,\ncolloquially, just oida ton S\u00f4krat\u00ean sophon,\nliterally \u201cI know Socrates wise\u201d. Thus the Greek\nidiom can readily treat the object of propositional knowledge, which\nin English would most naturally be a that-clause, as a thing\nconsidered as having a quality. We might almost say that Greek\ntreats what is known in propositional knowledge as just one special\ncase of what is known in objectual knowledge. This suggests that the\nancient Greeks naturally saw propositional and objectual knowledge as\nmore closely related than we do (though not necessarily as\nindistinguishable). If so, Plato may have felt able to offer a single\ntreatment for the two kinds of knowledge without thereby confusing\nthem. The point will be relevant to the whole of the\nTheaetetus.\n",
