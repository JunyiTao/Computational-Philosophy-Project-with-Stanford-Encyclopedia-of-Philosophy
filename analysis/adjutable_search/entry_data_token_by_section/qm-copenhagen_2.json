The Correspondence Rule\n\nThe guiding principle behind Bohr\u2019s and later Heisenberg\u2019s\nwork in the development of a consistent theory of atoms was the\ncorrespondence rule. The full rule states that a transition between\nstationary states is allowed if, and only if, there is a corresponding\nharmonic component in the classical motion (CW Vol. 3, p.\n479). Bohr furthermore realized that according to his theory of the\nhydrogen atom, the frequencies of radiation due to the\nelectron\u2019s transition between stationary states with high\nquantum numbers, i.e. states far from the ground state, coincide\napproximately with the results of classical electrodynamics. Hence in\nthe search for a theory of quantum mechanics it became a\nmethodological requirement to Bohr that any further theory of the atom\nshould predict values in domains of high quantum numbers that should\nbe a close approximation to the values of classical physics. The\ncorrespondence rule was a heuristic principle meant to make sure that\nin areas where the influence of Planck\u2019s constant could be\nneglected the numerical values predicted by such a theory should be\nthe same as if they were predicted by classical radiation theory.\n\nThe Bohr-Sommerfeld core model of the atomic structure came into\ntrouble in the beginning of the 1920s due to the fact that it\ncouldn\u2019t handle an increasing number of spectroscopic phenomena.\nIn 1924 Wolfgang Pauli introduced a new degree of freedom according to\nwhich two electrons with the same known quantum numbers could not be\nin the same state. A year later, in 1925, Ralph Kronig, Georg\nUhlenbeck and Samuel Goudsmit explained this new degree of freedom by\nintroducing the non-classical concept of electron spin. It has been\nsuggested, however, that Pauli\u2019s proposal meant a lethal blow\nnot only to the Bohr-Sommerfeld model, but also to the correspondence\nprinciple because \u201chow to reconcile the classical periodic\nmotions presupposed by the correspondence principle with the\nclassically non-describable Zweideutigkeit of the\nelectron\u2019s angular momentum?\u201d (Massimi 2005, p. 73)\n\nAlthough the exclusion rule and the introduction of spin broke with\nthe attempt to explain the structure of the basic elements along the\nlines of the correspondence argument (as Pauli pointed out in a letter\nto Bohr) Bohr continued to think of it as an important methodological\nprinciple in the attempt to establish a coherent quantum theory. In\nfact, he repeatedly expressed the opinion that Heisenberg\u2019s\nmatrix mechanics came to light under the guidance of this very\nprinciple. In his Faraday Lectures from 1932, for instance, Bohr\nemphasizes: \u201cA fundamental step towards the establishing of a\nproper quantum mechanics was taken in 1925 by Heisenberg who showed\nhow to replace the ordinary kinematical concepts, in the spirit of the\ncorrespondence argument, by symbols referring to the elementary\nprocesses and the probability of their occurrence\u201d (CC,\np. 48). Bohr acknowledged, however, that the correspondence argument\nfailed too in those cases where particular non-classical concepts have\nto be introduced into the description of atoms. But he still thought\nthat the correspondence argument was indispensable for both structural\nand semantic reasons in constructing a proper quantum theory as a\ngeneralised theory from classical mechanics.\n\nIndeed, spin is a quantum property of the electrons which cannot be\nunderstood as a classical angular momentum. Needless to say, Bohr\nfully understood that. But he didn\u2019t think that this discovery\nruled out the use of the correspondence rule as guidance to finding a\nsatisfactory quantum theory. A lengthy quotation from Bohr\u2019s\npaper \u201cThe Causality Problem in Atomic Physics\u201d (1938)\ngives evidence for this:\n\nIndeed, as adequate as the quantum postulates are in the\nphenomenological description of the atomic reactions, as indispensable\nare the basic concepts of mechanics and electrodynamics for the\nspecification of atomic structures and for the definition of\nfundamental properties of the agencies with which they react. Far from\nbeing a temporary compromise in this dilemma, the recourse to\nessentially statistical considerations is our only conceivable means\nof arriving at a generalization of the customary way of description\nsufficiently wide to account for the features of individuality\nexpressed by the quantum postulates and reducing to classical theory\nin the limiting case where all actions involved in the analysis of the\nphenomena are large compared with a single quantum. In the search for\nthe formulation of such a generalization, our only guide has just been\nthe so called correspondence argument, which gives expression for the\nexigency of upholding the use of classical concepts to the largest\npossible extent compatible with the quantum postulates. (CC,\np.96)\n\n\nThis shows that, according to Bohr, quantum mechanics, as formulated\nby Heisenberg, was a rational generalization of classical mechanics\nwhen the quantum of action and the spin property were taken into\naccount.\n\nThe correspondence rule was an important methodological principle. In\nthe beginning it had a clear technical meaning for Bohr. It is\nobvious, however, that it makes no sense to compare the numerical\nvalues of the theory of atoms with those of classical physics unless\nthe meaning of the physical terms in both theories is commensurable.\nThe correspondence rule was based on the epistemological idea that\nclassical concepts were indispensable for our understanding of\nphysical reality, and it is only when classical phenomena and quantum\nphenomena are described in terms of the same classical concepts that\nwe can compare different physical experiences. It was this broader\nsense of the correspondence rule that Bohr often had in mind later on.\nHe directly mentioned the relationship between the use of classical\nconcepts and the correspondence principle in 1934 when he wrote in the\nIntroduction to Atomic Theory and the Description of\nNature:\n\n[T]he necessity of making an extensive use \u2026 of the classical\nconcepts, upon which depends ultimately the interpretation of all\nexperience, gave rise to the formulation of the so-called\ncorrespondence principle which expresses our endeavours to utilize all\nthe classical concepts by giving them a suitable quantum-theoretical\nre-interpretation (ATDN, p. 8)\n\n\nBohr\u2019s practical methodology stands therefore in direct\nopposition to Thomas Kuhn and Paul Feyerabend\u2019s historical view\nthat succeeding theories, like classical mechanics and quantum\nmechanics, are incommensurable. In contrast to their philosophical\nclaims of meaning gaps and partial lack of rationality in the choice\nbetween incommensurable theories, Bohr believed not just\nretrospectively that quantum mechanics was a natural generalization of\nclassical physics, but he and Heisenberg followed in practice the\nrequirements of the correspondence rule. Thus, in the mind of Bohr,\nthe meaning of the classical concepts did not change but their\napplication was restricted. This was the lesson of\ncomplementarity.\n",
