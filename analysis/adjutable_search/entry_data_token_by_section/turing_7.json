    "main_text": "Unfinished Work\n8. Unfinished Work\n\n\nFrom 1950 Turing worked on a new mathematical theory of morphogenesis,\nbased on showing the consequences of non-linear equations for chemical\nreaction and diffusion (Turing 1952). He was a pioneer in using a\ncomputer for such work. Some writers have referred to this theory as\nfounding Artificial Life (A-life), but this is a misleading\ndescription, apt only to the extent that the theory was intended, as\nTuring saw it, to counter the Argument from Design. A-life since the\n1980s has concerned itself with using computers to explore the logical\nconsequences of evolutionary theory without worrying about specific\nphysiological forms. Morphogenesis is complementary, being concerned to\nshow which physiological pathways are feasible for evolution to\nexploit. Turing's work was developed by others in the 1970s and is now\nregarded as central to this field. \n\n\nIt may well be that Turing's interest in morphogenesis went back to\na primordial childhood wonder at the appearance of plants and flowers.\nBut in another late development, Turing went back to other stimuli of\nhis youth. For in 1951 Turing did consider the problem, hitherto\navoided, of setting computability in the context of quantum-mechanical\nphysics. In a BBC radio talk of that year (Turing 1951) he discussed\nthe basic groundwork of his 1950 paper, but this time dealing rather\nless certainly with the argument from G\u00f6del's theorem, and this\ntime also referring to the quantum-mechanical physics underlying the\nbrain. Turing described the universal machine property, applying it to\nthe brain, but said that its applicability required that the machine\nwhose behaviour is to be imitated\n\u2026should be of the sort whose behaviour is in\nprinciple predictable by calculation. We certainly do not know how any\nsuch calculation should be done, and it was even argued by Sir Arthur\nEddington that on account of the indeterminacy principle in quantum\nmechanics no such prediction is even theoretically\npossible.\n\n\nCopeland (1999) has rightly drawn attention to this sentence in his\npreface to his edition of the 1951 talk. However, Copeland's critical\ncontext suggests some connection with Turing's \u2018oracle.\u2019\nThere is is in fact no mention of oracles here (nor anywhere in\nTuring's post-war discussion of mind and machine.) Turing here is\ndiscussing the possibility that, when seen as as a\nquantum-mechanical machine rather than a classical machine,\nthe Turing machine model is inadequate. The correct connection to draw\nis not with Turing's 1938 work on ordinal logics, but with his\nknowledge of quantum mechanics from Eddington and von Neumann in his\nyouth. Indeed, in an early speculation, influenced by Eddington, Turing\nhad suggested that quantum mechanical physics could yield the basis of\nfree-will (Hodges 1983, p. 63). Von Neumann's axioms of quantum\nmechanics involve two processes: unitary evolution of the wave\nfunction, which is predictable, and the measurement or reduction\noperation, which introduces unpredictability. Turing's reference to\nunpredictability must therefore refer to the reduction process. The\nessential difficulty is that still to this day there is no agreed or\ncompelling theory of when or how reduction actually occurs. (It should\nbe noted that \u2018quantum computing,\u2019 in the standard modern\nsense, is based on the predictability of the unitary evolution, and\ndoes not, as yet, go into the question of how reduction occurs.) It\nseems that this single sentence indicates the beginning of a new field\nof investigation for Turing, this time into the foundations of quantum\nmechanics. In 1953 Turing wrote to his friend and student Robin Gandy\nthat he was \u2018trying to invent a new Quantum Mechanics but it\nwon't really work.\u2019\n\n\nAt Turing's death in June 1954, Gandy reported in a letter to Newman\non what he knew of Turing's current work (Gandy 1954). He wrote of\nTuring having discussed a problem in understanding the reduction\nprocess, in the form of\n\u2026\u2018the Turing Paradox\u2019; it is easy to\nshow using standard theory that if a system start in an eigenstate of\nsome observable, and measurements are made of that observable N times a\nsecond, then, even if the state is not a stationary one, the\nprobability that the system will be in the same state after, say, 1\nsecond, tends to one as N tends to infinity; i.e. that continual\nobservation will prevent motion. Alan and I tackled one or two\ntheoretical physicists with this, and they rather pooh-poohed it by\nsaying that continual observation is not possible. But there is nothing\nin the standard books (e.g., Dirac's) to this effect, so that at least the\nparadox shows up an inadequacy of Quantum Theory as usually\npresented.\n\n\nTuring's investigations take on added significance in view of the\nassertion of Penrose (1989, 1990, 1994, 1996) that the reduction\nprocess must involve something uncomputable. Probably Turing was aiming\nat the opposite idea, of finding a theory of the reduction process that\nwould be predictive and computable, and so plug the gap in his\nhypothesis that the action of the brain is computable. However Turing\nand Penrose are alike in seeing this as an important question affecting\nthe assumption that all mental action is computable; in this they both\ndiffer from the mainstream view in which the question is accorded\nlittle significance.\n\n\nAlan Turing's last postcards to Robin Gandy, in March 1954, headed\n\u2018Messages from the Unseen World\u2019 in allusion to Eddington,\nhinted at new ideas in the fundamental physics of relativity and\nparticle physics (Hodges 1983, p. 512). They illustrate the wealth of\nideas with which he was concerned at that last point in his life, but\nwhich apart from these hints are entirely lost. A review of such lost\nideas is given in (Hodges 2004), as part of a larger volume on\nTuring's legacy (Teuscher 2004).  \n",
