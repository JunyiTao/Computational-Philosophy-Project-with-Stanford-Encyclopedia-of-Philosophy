    "main_text": "\n\nThis entry aims to clarify how systems and synthetic biology\ncontribute to and extend discussions within philosophy of science.\nUnlike fields such as developmental biology or molecular biology,\nsystems and synthetic biology are not easily demarcated by a focus on\na specific subject area or level of organization. Rather, they are\ncharacterized by the development and application of mathematical,\ncomputational, and synthetic modeling strategies in response to\ncomplex problems and challenges within the life sciences. Proponents\nof systems and synthetic biology often stress the necessity of a\nperspective that goes beyond the scope of molecular biology and\ngenetic engineering, respectively. With the emphasis on systems and\ninteraction networks, the approaches explicitly engage in one of the\noldest philosophical discussions on reductionism vs. holism. Moreover,\nby pursuing ambitious aims such as the development of multiscale\ncomputational models and synthetic life forms, they uncover new ground\nfor philosophical analysis. Systems and synthetic biology raise\nfundamental questions about how far research can be taken through\ncomputational approaches, about the relation between living and\nartificial systems, and about the implications of interdisciplinary\nresearch for science and society.\n",
