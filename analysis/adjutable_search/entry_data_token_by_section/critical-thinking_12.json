    "main_text": "Critical Thinking Dispositions || Initiating Dispositions\n8.1 Initiating Dispositions\n\nUsing the strategy of considering factors that would block people with\nthe ability to think critically from doing so, we can identify as\ninitiating dispositions for thinking critically attentiveness, a habit\nof inquiry, self-confidence, courage, open-mindedness, willingness to\nsuspend judgment, trust in reason, wanting evidence for one\u2019s\nbeliefs, and seeking the truth. We consider briefly what each of these\ndispositions amounts to, in each case citing sources that acknowledge\nthem.\n\nAttentiveness: One will not think critically if one fails\nto recognize an issue that needs to be thought through. For example,\nthe pedestrian in\n Weather\n would not have looked up if he had not noticed that the air was\nsuddenly cooler. To be a critical thinker, then, one needs to be\nhabitually attentive to one\u2019s surroundings, noticing not only\nwhat one senses but also sources of perplexity in messages received\nand in one\u2019s own beliefs and attitudes (Facione 1990a: 25;\nFacione, Facione, & Giancarlo 2001).\nHabit of inquiry: Inquiry is effortful, and one needs an\ninternal push to engage in it. For example, the student in\n Bubbles\n could easily have stopped at idle wondering about the cause of the\nbubbles rather than reasoning to a hypothesis, then designing and\nexecuting an experiment to test it. Thus willingness to think\ncritically needs mental energy and initiative. What can supply that\nenergy? Love of inquiry, or perhaps just a habit of inquiry. Hamby\n(2015) has argued that willingness to inquire is the central critical\nthinking virtue, one that encompasses all the others. It is recognized\nas a critical thinking disposition by Dewey (1910: 29; 1933: 35),\nGlaser (1941: 5), Ennis (1987: 12; 1991: 8), Facione (1990a: 25),\nBailin et al. (1999b: 294), Halpern (1998: 452), and Facione, Facione,\n& Giancarlo (2001).\nSelf-confidence: Lack of confidence in one\u2019s\nabilities can block critical thinking. For example, if the woman in\n Rash\n lacked confidence in her ability to figure things out for herself,\nshe might just have assumed that the rash on her chest was the\nallergic reaction to her medication against which the pharmacist had\nwarned her. Thus willingness to think critically requires confidence\nin one\u2019s ability to inquire (Facione 1990a: 25; Facione,\nFacione, & Giancarlo 2001).\nCourage: Fear of thinking for oneself can stop one from\ndoing it. Thus willingness to think critically requires intellectual\ncourage (Paul & Elder 2006: 16).\nOpen-mindedness: A dogmatic attitude will impede thinking\ncritically. For example, a person who adheres rigidly to a\n\u201cpro-choice\u201d position on the issue of the legal status of\ninduced abortion is likely to be unwilling to consider seriously the\nissue of when in its development an unborn child acquires a moral\nright to life. Thus willingness to think critically requires\nopen-mindedness, in the sense of a willingness to examine questions to\nwhich one already accepts an answer but which further evidence or\nreasoning might cause one to answer differently (Dewey 1933; Facione\n1990a; Ennis 1991; Bailin et al. 1999b; Halpern 1998, Facione,\nFacione, & Giancarlo 2001). Paul (1981) emphasizes open-mindedness\nabout alternative world-views, and recommends a dialectical approach\nto integrating such views as central to what he calls \u201cstrong\nsense\u201d critical thinking. In three studies, Haran, Ritov, &\nMellers (2013) found that actively open-minded thinking, including\n\u201cthe tendency to weigh new evidence against a favored belief, to\nspend sufficient time on a problem before giving up, and to consider\ncarefully the opinions of others in forming one\u2019s own\u201d,\nled study participants to acquire information and thus to make\naccurate estimations.\nWillingness to suspend judgment: Premature closure on an\ninitial solution will block critical thinking. Thus willingness to\nthink critically requires a willingness to suspend judgment while\nalternatives are explored (Facione 1990a; Ennis 1991; Halpern\n1998).\nTrust in reason: Since distrust in the processes of\nreasoned inquiry will dissuade one from engaging in it, trust in them\nis an initiating critical thinking disposition (Facione 1990a, 25;\nBailin et al. 1999b: 294; Facione, Facione, & Giancarlo 2001; Paul\n& Elder 2006). In reaction to an allegedly exclusive emphasis on\nreason in critical thinking theory and pedagogy, Thayer-Bacon (2000)\nargues that intuition, imagination, and emotion have important roles\nto play in an adequate conception of critical thinking that she calls\n\u201cconstructive thinking\u201d. From her point of view, critical\nthinking requires trust not only in reason but also in intuition,\nimagination, and emotion.\nSeeking the truth: If one does not care about the truth\nbut is content to stick with one\u2019s initial bias on an issue,\nthen one will not think critically about it. Seeking the truth is thus\nan initiating critical thinking disposition (Bailin et al. 1999b: 294;\nFacione, Facione, & Giancarlo 2001). A disposition to seek the\ntruth is implicit in more specific critical thinking dispositions,\nsuch as trying to be well-informed, considering seriously points of\nview other than one\u2019s own, looking for alternatives, suspending\njudgment when the evidence is insufficient, and adopting a position\nwhen the evidence supporting it is sufficient.\n\n",
