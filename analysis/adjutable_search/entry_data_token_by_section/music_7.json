    "main_text": "Music and the Emotions || Emotions in the Listener\n3.2 Emotions in the Listener\n\nThere are three main questions asked about our emotional responses to\npure music, apart from what role they play in expressiveness. The\nfirst is analogous to the \u201cparadox of fiction.\u201d It is not\nclear why we should respond emotionally to music\u2019s\nexpressiveness when we know that no one is undergoing the emotions\nexpressed. The second is a variant of the \u201cparadox of\ntragedy.\u201d If some music arouses \u201cnegative\u201d emotional\nresponses in us, such as sadness, why do we seek out the experience of\nsuch music? This leads to the more general question of the value of\nour emotional responses to music. The first two questions are\naddressed in this section, and the third in section 5.1.\n\nPeter Kivy (1999) argues that those who report emotional reactions to\nmusic are confusing the pleasure they take in the beauty of the music,\nin all its expressive individuality, with the feeling of the emotion\nexpressed. Though most philosophers appeal to ordinary experience and\nempirical data to reject the plausibility of Kivy\u2019s position,\nthey admit the problem that motivates it, namely, the conceptual\ntension between the nature of music and the nature of the emotions we\nfeel in response to it. There is some consensus that emotions are\ncognitive, in the sense that they take intentional objects\u2014they\nare about things\u2014of certain kinds. For instance, in\norder to feel fear, one must believe that something is\nthreatening (the \u201cintentional object\u201d of the\nemotion). When one listens to a sad piece of music, however, one knows\nthere is nothing literally feeling sad, and thus it is puzzling that\none should be made sad by the experience.\n\nPart of the solution is that not all emotional responses (broadly\nconstrued) are cognitive (Robinson 1994; 2005: 387\u2013400). For\ninstance, it is no more puzzling that one could be startled by a\nfortissimo blow to a bass drum than that one could so respond\nto a thunderclap. Another part of the solution is that the music can\nbe the object of our emotions, as when we are delighted by an\neffective ending to a long and complex piece.\n\nAs for emotional responses to music\u2019s expressiveness, there are\nat least two possible explanations. One appeals to the phenomenon of\n\u201cemotional contagion\u201d or \u201cmirroring responses\u201d\n(S. Davies 1994: 279\u2013307; 2006: 186\u20138). When surrounded by\nmoping people, one tends to become sad. Moreover, such a\n\u201cmood\u201d is not about some intentional object. One\nis not necessarily sad for the mopers, nor whatever they are\nsad about, if anything. Similarly, when \u201csurrounded\u201d by\nmusic that presents an appearance of sadness, one might become sad,\nbut not sad about the music, or anything else (Radford 1991). For\ncritical discussion, see Robinson 2005: 379\u2013412 and S. Davies\n2011b.\n\nIf our experience of music\u2019s expressiveness necessarily involves\nimagining that the music is a literal expression of emotion,\nthen our emotional responses to that expressiveness are no more\npuzzling than emotional responses to other imagined expressive agents,\nsuch as fictional characters in novels. The advantage is only slight\nbecause the question of how and why we respond emotionally to fictions\nis itself a philosophical problem of some magnitude. Nonetheless,\nthere are several theories available (see the\n supplement to the entry on imagination, \u00a72).\n One difficulty with appealing to a solution to the paradox of fiction\nis that it is not clear that our emotional responses to the\nexpressiveness of music are the same as those to emotionally\nexpressive characters. For instance, the standard example of an\nemotional response to music is being made sad by a dirge, while the\nstandard example of emotional response to fiction is (something like)\nto feel pity for a sad character. If the former is to be explained in\nthe same way as the latter, we would expect listeners to feel\npity in response to the funeral march (pity for the persona\nimagined to be expressing her sadness through it). However, we surely\ndo feel sad (in some sense) in response to tragedy, and it is not\nobvious that we do not feel pity (or imagined pity, or\nwhatever one\u2019s preferred theory of emotional response to fiction\nposits) in response to sad music.\n\nLeaving behind the topic of how and why we respond emotionally to\nmusic, we turn to the question of why we seek out music that arouses\n\u201cnegative\u201d emotions in us, such as sadness, assuming\nhenceforth that we are in fact aroused to such emotions. (Since this\nproblem is a close analog of the \u201cparadox of tragedy,\u201d\nsome of the references below are to literature not explicitly about\nmusic, but the transposition of the arguments to music is not\ndifficult to imagine. (See also the\n supplement to the entry on imagination, \u00a73.)\n Most solutions assume that our negative emotional response is a price\nwe are willing to pay for the benefits of engaging with the piece in\nquestion. The benefits appealed to include understanding and\nappreciating the music, including the expressiveness responsible for\nthe negative response (Goodman 1968: 247\u201351; S. Davies 1994:\n311\u201320; Goldman 1995: 68; Robinson 2005: 348\u201378).\n\nA different benefit is Aristotelian catharsis, in which our\nnegative emotional response to expressive art results in a\npsychological purgation of the negative emotions (Aristotle 1987: 6,\n1449b21\u20131450b20). A less therapeutic approach is the suggestion\nthat, since these emotions are without \u201clife implications\u201d\n(that is, as discussed above, we are not sad about any actual\ntragic events), we are able to take advantage of our responses to\nsavor these emotions, gain an understanding of them, and be reassured\nthat we have the capacity to feel them (Levinson 1982). Two things\nthat must be explained by any defender of this kind of response are,\nfirst, our persistence in seeking out music that elicits negative\nemotional experiences after we have received the resulting benefit\nand, second, the enjoyment we seem to take in these negative\nresponses, as opposed to putting up with them for their related\nbenefits.\n\nA different kind of solution to the problem argues that responses such\nas sadness that are evoked by expressive music are not really\nnegative. Hume (1757) argues, with respect to tragedy, that the\npleasure we take in the mode of presentation of the content of an\nartwork does not simply counterbalance the negative emotion evoked,\nbut rather subsumes and transforms it into a pleasurable feeling.\nKendall Walton argues (also with respect to tragedy) that sadness is\nnot in itself negative. Rather, it is the situation to which sadness\nis the response that is negative. Thus, though we would not seek out\nthe death of a loved one, given the death we\n\u201cwelcome\u201d the sorrow (K. Walton 1990: 255\u20139).\nSimilarly, we cannot affect the sadness of a musical work by not\nlistening to it, and so we welcome our sorrowful response to it as\nappropriate. Berys Gaut (2007: 203\u201326) argues that though\nsadness is typically aroused by situations we would prefer to\navoid, sadness in response to artistic expressiveness is an exception\nand thus not negative in any paradoxical way. A difficulty for all\nthree solutions is the extent to which they accord with our emotional\nexperience in rejecting the characterization of our sadness as\nnegative.\n",
