Contemporary Aesthetics and the Problem of Pornographic Art\n\nWhile not everyone will take the aesthetic recuperation of the erotic\nas far as Shusterman and Nehamas, very few philosophers today will\ndeny the existence and aesthetic legitimacy of erotic art. So, does\nthis mean that the wall between the sexual and the aesthetic has been\ntorn down? Not entirely. It seems more accurate to say that the battle\nlines have been redrawn. The suspicion towards the erotic may have\nlargely subsided in contemporary aesthetics, but it has been replaced\nby a very pronounced scepticism of the pornographic. Many philosophers\nof art, including Roger Scruton, Jerrold Levinson, and Christy Mag\nUidhir, deny that there is (or can be) such a thing as pornographic\nart. In other words, they advocate a strict divide between erotic art\nand pornography. Some of their scepticism, one cannot fail to notice,\nbears a significant resemblance to the earlier resistance against\nerotic art.\n\nPornographic representations are sexually explicit and rich in\nanatomical detail, Scruton points out, whereas works of erotic art\nrely on suggestion and, instead of focusing on certain body parts,\nwill try to capture the individuality, personality, and subjectivity\nof the represented person. In Titian\u2019s\nVenus of Urbino (1538), for instance, it is not the\nsexual organs but the face, as \u201cwindow to the soul,\u201d that\nprovides the focus of attention (1986: 154, 2005: 11, 2009: 149). A\npornographic image, by contrast, \u201cis like a magic wand that\nturns subjects into objects, people into things\u2014and thereby\ndisenchants them, destroying the source of their beauty\u201d (2009:\n163). As part of his project to rehabilitate beauty as the central\naesthetic and artistic category, Scruton also appeals to the\ndistinction between \u201cthe nude\u201d and \u201cthe naked\u201d\nmade famous by Kenneth Clark (1956). The artistic nude constitutes, as\nthe subtitle of Clark\u2019s book indicates, a \u201cStudy in Ideal\nForm\u201d: the body is beautifully shaped and framed by the\nconventions of art. The people in pornographic images are not nude,\nbut naked. They are deprived of clothes, and as such exposed in an\nembarrassing way. Furthermore, while the Titian nude retains a\ndetached serenity, pornography arouses the viewer, which is always\n\u201can aesthetic defect, a \u2018fall\u2019 into another kind of\ninterest than that which has beauty as its target\u201d (2009:\n160).\n\nLevinson also wishes to separate erotic art from pornography in terms\nof the kind of response they call for, yet his argument is markedly\ndifferent from Scruton\u2019s. Here\u2019s a summary of\nLevinson\u2019s argument:\n\nErotic art consists of images centrally aimed at a certain sort of\nreception (R1).\nPornography consists of images centrally aimed at a certain sort\nof reception (R2).\nR1 essentially involves attention to form/vehicle/medium/manner,\nand so entails treating images as in part opaque.\nR2 essentially excludes attention to form/vehicle/medium/manner,\nand so entails treating images as wholly transparent.\nR1 and R2 are incompatible.\nHence, nothing can be both erotic art and pornography; or at the\nleast, nothing can be coherently projected as both erotic art and\npornography; or at the very least, nothing can succeed as erotic art\nand pornography at the same time. (2005: 239)\n\n\nElsewhere in the article Levinson makes it clear that by\n\u201cR1\u201d he means aesthetic delight or aesthetic experience\nand that \u201cR2\u201d refers to sexual arousal and release:\n\n\nthe aims of true pornography and the aims of art, erotic art included,\nare not compatible, but war against one another (\u2026). One\ninduces you, in the name of arousal and release, to ignore the\nrepresentation so as to get at the represented, the other induces you,\nin the name of aesthetic delight, to dwell on the representation.\n(2005: 234)\n\n\nThis has been the single most influential argument in recent debates\non the relation between erotic art and pornography, winning many\nsupporters (Matthen 2011; Nanay 2012; Neill 2012) but also attracting\na substantial amount of criticism (see, for instance, Kania 2012;\nDavies 2012; van Brabandt and Prinz 2012; Patridge 2013). While one\nmay want to challenge some of Levinson\u2019s premises (as Maes 2009\ndoes in a systematic way), one could also question whether his rather\nradical conclusion really follows from said premises. After all, it\nseems that one can (coherently and successfully) aim at\nincompatible audience responses, as long as one does not expect these\nresponses to be elicited at the same time, in the same audience (see\nMaes 2011).\n\nAs opposed to key representatives of modern aesthetics, both Levinson\nand Scruton have no problem acknowledging the existence of erotic art.\nHowever, they do object very strongly to the possibility of there\nbeing pornographic art, and it\u2019s not hard to discern in their\nrespective objections\u2014which rely on notions such as beauty,\ncontemplation, ideal form, aesthetic experience\u2014the remnants and\nresidual influence of modern aesthetics. This is less obvious in\nChristy Mag Uidhir\u2019s attempt to draw a line between pornography\nand art. While Scruton insists on the controversial connection between\nart and beauty, and Levinson builds his case on the idea that a work\nof art\u2019s main purpose is to produce an aesthetic experience and\ndraw attention to its own formal features, Mag Uidhir\u2019s argument\ndoes not rely on any such substantial claims. He does not even claim\nthat art has or should have a purpose. Mag Uidhir asks us only to\naccept that if a work of art has a purpose, including perhaps\nthe purpose of sexual titillation as is the case in erotic art, then\nthat purpose must be manner specific. Here\u2019s how he arrives at\nhis exclusivist position (2009: 194):\n\nIf something is pornography, then that something has the purpose\nof sexual arousal (of some audience).\nIf something is pornography, then that something has the purpose\nof sexual arousal and that purpose is manner inspecific.\nIf something is art, then if that something has a purpose, then\nthat purpose is manner specific.\nIf something is art, then if that something has the purpose of\nsexual arousal, then that purpose is manner specific.\nA purpose cannot be both manner specific and manner\ninspecific.\nTherefore, if something is pornography, then it is not art.\n\n\nFor a purpose to be manner specific, according to Mag Uidhir, is for\nit to be essentially constituted both by an action (or state of\naffairs) and a manner, such that the purpose is to perform that action\n(or bring about that state of affairs) in that particular manner. A\npurpose is manner inspecific, on the other hand, if failure to perform\nthe action (or bring about the state of affairs) in the prescribed\nmanner does not necessarily constitute failure to satisfy the\npurpose.\n\nMag Uidhir\u2019s approach is markedly different from Scruton\u2019s\nand Levinson\u2019s. Still, regarding the central issue, he aligns\nhimself squarely with other sceptics. He, too, thinks that artists or\npornographers attempting to produce something that is both (erotic)\nart and pornography, in fact attempt the impossible. However, recent\ncritics of Mag Uidhir have raised doubts about his second premise\n(Davies 2012; Patridge 2013), as well as the general validity of his\nargument (Maes 2012). These critics belong to a growing number of\nphilosophers who find exclusivists\u2019 arguments unconvincing and\nargue for the existence of pornographic art as a subclass of erotic\nart (Kieran 2001, van Brabandt and Prinz 2012, Fokt 2012).\n",
