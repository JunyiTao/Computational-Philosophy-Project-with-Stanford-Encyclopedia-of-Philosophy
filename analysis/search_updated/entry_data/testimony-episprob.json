    "preamble": "\n\nSo much of what we know about the world, e.g., history, science,\npolitics, one another, etc., comes from the testimony of others. But\nwhile testimony is clearly an indispensable source of knowledge,\nspecifying exactly how it is that we are able to learn from a\nspeaker\u2019s say-so has proven to be a difficult task.\n\nTo this end, a lot (but certainly not all) of the interest in the\nepistemology of testimony has centered on the following questions:\n\nIs testimony a basic source of justification, or can testimonial\njustification be reduced to a combination of other epistemic sources,\ne.g., perception, memory, and inference?\nCan testimony generate knowledge, or can it merely transmit\nit?\nWhen one acquires testimonial justification, is one\u2019s belief\njustified by evidence, or by something else, e.g., non-evidential\nassurances?\nShould testimonial justification be understood individualistically\n(in the sense that one\u2019s testimonial justification depends\nentirely on factors having to do with one\u2019s self), or should it\nbe understood anti-individualistically (in the sense that one\u2019s\ntestimonial justification depends at least in part on factors having\nto do with the speaker)?\nHow should we understand the difference between expert and novice\ntestimony?\nDo groups testify? And if so, how can we learn from a\ngroup\u2019s say-so?\nWhat is testimony itself?\n\n\nThe aim of this article is to provide an overview of the major debates\nsurrounding these issues.\n\nBefore moving on, it is important to note that these are certainly not\nthe only important questions about testimony. For instance, there is a\ngrowing literature about how failing to give a testifier the credit\nthey deserve gives rise to a form of epistemic injustice\n(e.g., M. Fricker\n 2007).[1]\n Moreover, there are many interesting questions about eyewitness\ntestimony and the law (e.g., Wells & Olson 2003 and Burroughs\n& Tollefsen 2016), as well as important questions about the\nrelationship between testimony and assertion (e.g., Pagin 2007\n[2016]). And there are also growing literatures about moral\n testimony[2]\n and aesthetic\n testimony,[3]\n e.g., while it is uncontroversial that you can acquire justification\nfor believing that the taco truck is open by relying on your\nfriend\u2019s say-so, it is far less clear that you can acquire\njustification for believing that eating carne asada is morally wrong\nor that the mural on the taco truck is beautiful, solely on the basis\nof what your friend tells you. For reasons only having to do with\nspace, though, this article will focus exclusively on the seven\nquestions above.\n",

    "main_text": "\n1. Reductionism and Non-Reductionism\n\nConsider this scenario: Your friend testifies to you that your\nfavorite team won last night\u2019s game (= p). Because you\nknow that your friend is a highly reliable sports reporter, and\nbecause you have no reason to doubt what she says on this occasion,\nyou believe what you are told. In this case, your belief that p\nis clearly justified.\n\nNow, contrast that scenario with this one: You run into a stranger\nwhom you have never met and they tell you that your favorite team won\nlast night\u2019s game (= p). Even though you don\u2019t know\nif this person often speaks the truth, you also don\u2019t have any\ngood reason to doubt what they are telling you. Thus, you decide to\nbelieve what you are told. Whether or not your belief that p is\njustified in this case is a lot less clear.\n\nThinking about the difference between cases like these helps motivate\nthe debate about the following question:\n\n\nFirst Big Question: Is testimony a basic source of\njustification, or can testimonial justification be reduced to a\ncombination of other epistemic sources?\n\n\nThose who defend answers to this question tend to endorse one of three\nmain positions: Reductionism, Non-Reductionism, and\nHybrid Views.\n1.1 Reductionism\n\nReductionists maintain that in order to acquire testimonial\njustification, one must have positive reasons for thinking that the\nspeaker in question is a reliable testifier. More specifically,\nReductionists endorse\n\n\nPositive Reasons: A hearer is justified in believing what a\nspeaker says if, and only if, they (a) have positive reasons for\nthinking that the speaker\u2019s testimony is reliable, where these\nreasons are not themselves ultimately based on testimony, and (b) do\nnot have any undefeated\n defeaters[4]\n that indicate that the speaker\u2019s testimony is false or unlikely\nto be true.\n\n\nReductionist views trace at least as far back as David Hume\u2019s\n(1740, 1748)\u2014see Traiger (1993, 2010), Faulkner (1998), Root\n(2001), Fogelin (2005), van Cleve (2006), Gelfert (2010), and Shieber\n(2015) for more on Hume\u2019s view in particular. More recently,\nother Reductionist views have been defended by E. Fricker (1987, 1994,\n1995, 2002, 2006a, 2006b), Adler (1994, 2002), Lyons (1997), Lipton\n(1998), Shogenji (2006), Sutton (2007), Malmgren (2006), and Kenyon\n(2013).\n\nOne of the primary motivations for Reductionism stems from concerns\nhaving to do with gullibility; that is, many reductionists\nmaintain that if we could justifiably accept a speaker\u2019s\ntestimony without having positive reasons for thinking that they\ntypically speak the truth, then we would be justified in accepting\ntestimony in cases in which doing so would be clearly irresponsible.\nSo for example, if a hearer does not need positive reasons for\nthinking that the speaker\u2019s testimony is reliable, then one\ncould be justified in believing the say-so of a random blogger on an\narbitrary website so long as one did not have any reasons for doubting\nthe testimony in question.\n\nNow, while all Reductionists endorse Positive Reasons, there is\ndisagreement over exactly how this thesis should be understood. For\nthis reason, Reductionists fall into one of two camps: Global\nReductionists and Local Reductionists.\n1.1.1 Global Reductionism\n\nAccording to Global Reductionism, in order to be justified in\naccepting a speaker\u2019s testimony, you need to have positive\nreasons for believing that testimony is generally reliable, i.e., that\naccepting the reports of others is a reliable way of forming true\nbeliefs. For instance, suppose that your friend tells you that he got\na puppy. Global Reductionists maintain that you are only justified in\naccepting this report if you have positive reasons that support\ninferences like the following:\n\nMy friend said that he got a puppy.\nRelying on testimony is generally a reliable way to form true\nbeliefs, i.e., most people tend to say true things.\nTherefore, my friend got a puppy.\n\n\nIt is in this sense that Global Reductionists think that testimonial\njustification can be reduced to a combination of perceptual, memorial,\nand inferential justification. That is, testimonial justification can\nbe reduced to a combination of other epistemic sources because it only\ninvolves you (i) perceiving that the speaker made an utterance (ii)\nremembering that when people have told you things in the past, they\nturned out to be right most of the time and (iii) inferring on this\nbasis that what you were told on this occasion is likely to be\ntrue.\n\nHistorically, Global Reductionism has been saddled with three\nobjections. First, opponents have argued that any attempt to acquire\nnon-testimonially based reasons for thinking that testimony is\ngenerally reliable will either be viciously circular or else involve\nan insurmountable regress. For instance, in order to know that people\ngenerally speak the truth, I might need to rely on Bill\u2019s\ntestimony to confirm that what Alice said was true. But in order to\nknow that Bill can be trusted, I might need to rely on Carly to\nconfirm that he usually says true things. But to ensure that Carly\ntypically speaks the truth, I will either need to rely on Alice or\nBill to confirm this for me (hence the vicious circle), or else I will\nneed to rely on on a fourth person like Donald (and hence the regress\nwill continue). Thus, because there is no good way to acquire the\nnon-testimonially based reasons in question, Global Reductionism\nproblematically entails that we are rarely (if ever) justified in\naccepting what people tell us. See Coady (1992) for this worry, and\nsee Wright (2016a, 2019) for an importantly different kind of\ncircularity worry for all Reductionist views.\n\nSecond, and relatedly, opponents have argued that in order to acquire\nnon-testimonially based reasons for thinking that testimony is\ngenerally reliable, we would need to be exposed to loads and loads of\nfacts that correspond to the things that we receive testimony about,\ni.e., in order to check if testimony about history, medicine, biology,\netc., is generally reliable, we would need to have confirmed many of\nthese facts for ourselves. However, most (if not all) of us simply\nlack the time and resources to confirm such things. Thus, Global\nReductionism seems to problematically entail that we are rarely (if\never) justified in accepting what other people tell us. See, e.g.,\nCoady (1992).\n\nTo see the third worry with Global Reductionism, notice that Global\nReductionists treat testimony as if it is a unified, homogeneous\ncategory, i.e., according to Global Reductionists, testimony in\ngeneral can be a more or less reliable source of knowledge. The\nproblem here is that we frequently receive testimony about wildly\ndifferent topics, e.g., quantum mechanics, politics, one\u2019s own\nmusic preferences, etc. And clearly testimony about some of these\nthings is highly reliable (e.g., all of your friends are probably very\ngood at speaking truly about what kinds of music they like), whereas\ntestimony about other topics is less so (e.g., if your friends are\nlike mine, then at least a few of them are probably a lot less\nreliable at speaking truly about politics). Thus, contra Global\nReductionism, it is a mistake to treat testimony as a unified source\nof knowledge; that is, instead of thinking about testimony in general,\nwe should think about the various categories of testimony in\nparticular, e.g., categories differentiated by subject matter. For it\nis only when we think of testimony as being disaggregated in this way\nthat it make sense to ask about whether receiving testimony about a\nparticular category is a reliable source of knowledge. See, e.g., E.\nFricker (1994).\n1.1.2 Local Reductionism\n\nAccording to Local Reductionism, in order to be justified in accepting\na speaker\u2019s testimony, the hearer needs to have\nnon-testimonially based reasons for thinking that the speaker in\nquestion is a reliable testifier on this occasion (as opposed to\nhaving positive reasons for thinking that testimony in general is\nreliable). For instance, suppose your friend tells you that he got a\npuppy and that you make the following inference:\n\nMy friend said that he got a puppy\nMy friend usually speaks the truth (especially when they are in\ncontexts like these and when they are reporting about things in this\ndomain, e.g., things having to do with getting new pets).\nTherefore, my friend got a puppy.\n\n\nLocal Reductionists maintain that you are only justified in accepting\nwhat you are told on this occasion if you have non-testimonially based\nreasons that support (1) and (2). For instance, perhaps you know that\nyour friend usually speaks the truth about these sorts of things\nbecause you have known them for a long time. Or perhaps it is because\nyou know that, generally speaking, anyone who takes the time to talk\nto you about their pets is probably telling the truth. Or perhaps it\nis because you know that when you ask people about their pets in this\nkind of context, it is highly likely that you will get an honest\nanswer.\n\nRegardless of how these non-testimonially based reasons are acquired,\nit is in this sense that Local Reductionists also think that\ntestimonial justification can be reduced to a combination of\nperceptual, memorial, and inferential justification, i.e., testimonial\njustification only consists in you perceiving that the speaker made an\nutterance and then inferring on this basis that what the speaker said\non this occasion is likely to be true.\n\nLocal Reductionists are well positioned to avoid the problems that\nplague Global Reductionism. This is because they are not committed to\nthe claim that testimony is a unified category, i.e., instead of\nthinking about the reliability of testimony in general, we only need\nto think about the reliability of each piece of testimony that we are\noffered on a given occasion. Moreover, Local Reductionists do not\nmaintain that in order to be justified in accepting a speaker\u2019s\nsay-so, one needs positive reasons for thinking that testimony in\ngeneral is a reliable source of knowledge. Thus, even if you lack the\nresources to confirm that most people generally speak the truth, you\ncan still have non-testimonially based reasons for thinking that what\nthe speaker said is likely to be true on this occasion. For instance,\nif your relationship is long enough, you can come to know that your\nfriend has a great track record of saying true things about getting\nnew pets, since anytime they say this, you can just go over to their\nplace and see their new puppy for yourself. And because you\ndon\u2019t need to rely on the testimony of a third party to acquire\nthese positive reasons, there is no worry of running into the kinds of\nvicious circles or insurmountable regresses that Global Reductionists\nneed to explain away.\n\nHistorically, though, there are at least three problems that cause\ntrouble for Local Reductionists. First, opponents have objected to\nLocal Reductionism on the grounds that it problematically excludes\nyoung children (e.g., 3-year-olds) from justifiably accepting what\ntheir parents tell them. For if Local Reductionism is true, then in\norder to be justified in accepting a parent\u2019s testimony, a young\nchild would need non-testimonially based reasons for thinking that\nthis parent is a reliable testifier. But youngsters simply lack the\nworldly experience to have good reasons for thinking that their\nparents\u2019 reports are usually true, i.e., they have not been\naround long enough to have confirmed enough of these reports for\nthemselves. Thus, Local Reductionism problematically precludes young\nchildren from being able to learn from the say-so of their parents.\nSee, e.g., Audi (1997), and see also Harris (2002), Harris and\nCorriveau (2011) and Koenig and Harris (2007) for empirical results\nabout children accepting the testimony of others. (Note: This\nobjection poses a worry for Global Reductionists as well).\n\nSecond, opponents have objected to Local Reductionism on the grounds\nthat we can be justified in believing a speaker, S\u2019s,\ntestimony that p even if we lack the relevant non-testimonially\nbased reasons to support the inference from \u201cS said that\np\u201d to \u201cp\u201d. (See, e.g., Webb [1994:\n263\u2013264], Strawson [1994: 25], Schmitt [1999: 360] and Lackey\n[2008: 180]). For instance, suppose you arrive in a new country and\nspot someone on the street. And suppose that you approach this person\nand ask them for directions. Now, if that person tells you that your\nhotel is three blocks down the road, then it seems like you are\njustified in accepting their testimony that this is the case. But\nLocal Reductionism cannot accommodate this result. For insofar as the\nonly thing that justifies your belief is your inference from\n\u201cThis person said that my hotel is just down the road\u201d to\n\u201cMy hotel is just down the road\u201d, then since you know next\nto nothing about this stranger, and since you also know very little\nabout whether anyone in this area is likely to answer this sort of\nquestion honestly, it is hard to see how your non-testimonially based\nreasons for accepting this person\u2019s testimony are strong enough\nto justify you in believing what you are told on this occasion. (But\nsee, e.g., Kenyon [2013], who defends Local Reductionism from this\nworry by arguing that even if a hearer knows very little about the\nspeaker in question, they can still appeal to other contextual\ninformation to support their inference).\n\nThird, others have argued that given the current results in social\npsychology, there is good reason to reject Local Reductionism on the\ngrounds that it makes testimonial justification too hard to come by.\nThe worry here is that the evidence from social psychology suggests\nthat humans are not very good at determining when a particular\ninstance of testimony is false or unlikely to be true. Thus, insofar\nas Local Reductionists maintain that hearers need to be good at\nmonitoring for these signs of falsehood and unreliability in order to\nhave positive reasons for thinking that a particular instance of\ntestimony is worth accepting, Local Reductionism problematically\nentails that we have way less testimonial justification than we\npreviously thought. See Michaelian (2010, 2013) and Shieber (2012,\n2015) for more on this style of objection, and see Sperber (2013) and\nHarris et al. (2018) for an empirical arguments to the contrary.\n(Note: This objection is not meant to just target Local Reductionism,\nbut Reductionist views more generally).\n\nReductionists have offered responses to all of the worries mentioned\nabove. For instance, see Owen (1987), Sobel (1987), and Alvin Goldman\n(1999: Ch. 4) for a Bayesian analysis of how a hearer can acquire\npositive reasons for accepting a speaker\u2019s testimony. See also\nE. Fricker (1995), Lipton (1998, 2007), Schiffer (2003), and Malmgren\n(2006) for more on how hearers can acquire these positive reasons via\ninference to the best explanation. And for more on debates surrounding\nReductionism in general, see Faulkner (2000), Elgin (2002), Lackey\n(2005a, 2006), Goldberg and Henderson (2006), Kenyon (2013) and Graham\n(2018). Whether or not these responses succeed remains an open\nquestion.\n1.2 Non-Reductionism\n\nAccording to Non-Reductionists, Positive Reasons is false, i.e., we\ndon\u2019t need positive reasons for thinking that a speaker\u2019s\ntestimony is reliable in order to be justified in believing what we\nare told. Instead, we have a defeasible but presumptive right to\nbelieve what people tell us. More specifically, Non-Reductionists\nendorse\n\n\nPresumptive Right: A hearer is justified (or\n warranted[5])\n in believing what a speaker says if they do not have an undefeated\ndefeater that indicates that the speaker\u2019s testimony is false or\nunlikely to be true. (Some Non-Reductionists (e.g., Goldberg &\nHenderson 2006) maintain that in addition to simply lacking any\nrelevant undefeated defeaters, the hearer must also be\ncounterfactually sensitive to, or on the lookout for, the\npresence of defeaters in their environment).\n\n\nNon-Reductionism traces at least as far back as Thomas Reid\u2019s\n(IE [1983, 94\u201395])\u2014see Wolterstorff (2001) for more on\nReid\u2019s view. More recently, various versions of Non-Reductionism\nhave been defended by Austin (1946 [1979]), Welbourne (1979, 1981,\n1986, 1994), Evans (1982), A. Ross (1986), Hardwig (1985, 1991), Coady\n(1992, 1994), Burge (1993, 1997, 2013), Plantinga (1993), Stevenson\n(1993), Webb (1993), Dummett (1994), Foley (1994), McDowell (1994),\nStrawson (1994), Williamson (1996, 2000), Millgram (1997), Alvin\nGoldman (1999), Schmitt (1999), Insole (2000), Owens (2000), Rysiew\n(2000), Weiner (2003), Graham (2006a), Sosa (2006), McMyler (2011) and\nBaker and Clark (2018). See also Audi (1997, 1998, 2004, 2006), who\ndefends Non-Reductionism about testimonial knowledge but not about\ntestimonial justification.\n\nOne motivation for Non-Reductionism stems from the desire to avoid the\nproblems associated with the various forms of Reductionism, e.g., if\nhearers are not required to have positive reasons for thinking that\nthe speaker\u2019s testimony is reliable on this occasion,\ntestimonial knowledge will not be too hard to acquire. Another\nmotivation (i.e., Reid IE [1983, 94\u201395]) is rooted in the following\nidea: Whatever reason we have for thinking that perception is a basic\nsource of justification, we have an analogous reason for thinking that\ntestimony is a basic source of justification too. For instance, we can\nrely on a speaker\u2019s testimony unless we have a good reason not\nto because humans are endowed\u2014perhaps by God or just by\nnature\u2014with the disposition to (a) tell the truth (b) believe\nwhat they are told and (c) have some sense of when a speaker is not to\nbe trusted.\n\nHowever, because Non-Reductionists reject Positive Reasons, opponents\nhave objected to the view on the grounds that it permits hearers to be\nirrationally gullible. For instance, recall the case in which you read\na bit of testimony from an anonymous blogger on an arbitrary website\n(i.e., E. Fricker 2002). Or consider this situation: While on your way\nhome from work you see a group of aliens from another planet drop a\nnotebook written in what appears to be English. Upon reading the\nnotebook, you see that the aliens seem to have testified that hungry\ntigers have eaten some of their friends (i.e., Lackey 2008:\n168\u2013169). While these cases are different in certain respects,\nthey are related by the fact that while you do not have any defeaters\nthat indicate that the testimony in question is false or unlikely to\nbe true, you also do not have any positive reasons for accepting what\nthe speaker says. Opponents of Non-Reductionism argue that because it\nwould be irrational for you to accept either of these reports, these\ncases show that Non-Reductionism is false and that in order to be\njustified in believing what a speaker says, you really do need\npositive reasons for thinking that the speaker\u2019s testimony is\nlikely to be true.\n1.3 Hybrid Views\n\nFinally, some epistemologists reject both Reductionism and\nNon-Reductionism in favor of various hybrid views. The primary\nmotivation for these hybrid views is to capture what seems promising\nabout the Reductionist and Non-Reductionist approaches while also\navoiding the objections discussed above.\n\nFor instance, instead of endorsing Reductionism and requiring that\nall hearers must possess strong, non-testimonially based\npositive reasons for thinking that the speaker in question is\nreliable, one might opt for a qualified hybrid view according to which\n(a) adults need to possess these positive reasons but (b) youngsters\nin the developmental phase do not, i.e., children are justified in\nbelieving a speaker\u2019s testimony so long as they do not have any\nreasons to not do so. One upshot of this hybrid view is that unlike\nstandard versions of Reductionism, it is possible for young children\nto be justified in believing what their parents tell them. See, e.g.,\nE. Fricker (1995).\n\nOr, one might opt for a hybrid view according to which the hearer and\nthe speaker both have an important role to play in the hearer\u2019s\nability to acquire testimonial justification, i.e., it takes two\nto tango, so to speak. For instance, perhaps a hearer does need\nto possess at least some non-testimonially based reasons for thinking\nthat the speaker in question is a reliable testifier on this occasion.\nBut insofar as the hearer\u2019s inference from \u201cS said\nthat p\u201d to \u201cP\u201d is not the only thing\nthat justifies the hearer\u2019s belief, these reasons do not need to\nbe nearly as strong as standard Reductionists have made them out to\nbe; that is, so long as the hearer\u2019s non-testimonially based\nreasons render it not irrational to rely on the speaker\u2019s\nsay-so, then this is good enough. And this is because, in addition to\nthe hearer having these weaker kinds of positive reasons, the speaker\nin question needs to actually be a reliable reporter. The hope here is\nthat by requiring contributions from both the speaker and the hearer,\nall of the worries associated with standard versions of Reductionism\nand Non-reductionism can be avoided. For instance, by requiring that\nthe speaker has these weaker kinds of positive reasons, this hybrid\nview can explain how young children can acquire testimonial\njustification while also avoiding the worries associated with\ngullibility. See, e.g., Lackey (2008). And for defenses of other\nhybrid views, see E. Fricker (2006b), Faulkner (2000), Lehrer (2006),\nand Pritchard (2006).\n\nWhether any of these hybrid views will ultimately succeed is still\nvery much an open debate. However, opponents have worried that at\nleast some of these accounts either run into the same objections that\nplagued standard versions of Reductionism and Non-Reductionism, or\nthat they incur entirely new problems of their own, e.g., Insole\n(2000), Weiner (2003) and Lackey (2008).\n2. Knowledge Transmission and Generation\n\nConsider this scenario: Gretchen knows that the bakery is closed. If\nGretchen tells you that this is the case, and if all goes well, then\nit is uncontroversial that you can acquire testimonial knowledge that\nthe bakery is closed too.\n\nNow, contrast that scenario with this one: Gretchen does not know that\nthe bakery is closed (perhaps because she simply lacks any\njustification for believing this). Nevertheless, she testifies to you\nthat the bakery is closed anyway. If you come to believe that the\nbakery is closed on the basis of Gretchen\u2019s testimony, and if\nthe bakery really is closed, then is it possible for your belief to\namount to knowledge?\n\nDepending on how the details are filled in, things are much more\ncontroversial in this second scenario. The controversy centers on the\nfollowing question:\n\n\nSecond Big Question: Can testimony generate knowledge, or can\nit merely transmit it?\n\n\nOtherwise put, can a hearer acquire testimonial knowledge that\np from a speaker who does not know that p\nthemselves?\n\nBefore moving on, two clarification points are in order. First, while\nmuch of the debate about the Transmission View has centered on whether\ntestimony can only transmit knowledge, there is also some\ndebate about whether testimony can transmit justification.\n(See, e.g., Audi [1997] who maintains that while testimony can\ngenerate justification, it can only transmit knowledge. See also\nWright 2016a for a recent discussion of other views according to which\ntestimony transmits knowledge but generates justification). Second,\ndebates about knowledge transmission bear on debates about the\nInheritance View\n (Section 3.1.2)\n and on the Individualism vs. Non-Individualism debate\n (Section 4).\n2.1 The Transmission View\n\nAccording to the Transmission View, testimonial knowledge can only be\ntransmitted from a speaker to a hearer. Here is one (but not the only)\nway of formulating this view in terms of necessity and\nsufficiency:\n\n\nTV-S: For every speaker, A, and hearer,\nB, if\n\nA knows that p,\nB comes to believe that p on the basis of\nA\u2019s testimony and\nB has no undefeated defeaters for believing that p,\nthen B comes to know that p too.\n\n\n(See Austin 1946 [1979]; Welbourne 1979, 1981, 1986, 1994; Evans 1982;\nE. Fricker 1987; Coady 1992; McDowell 1994; Adler 1996, 2002; Owens\n2000, 2006; Burge 1993; Williamson 1996, 2000; and Audi 1997).\n\nTV-N: For every speaker, A, and hearer,\nB, B knows that p on the basis of\nA\u2019s testimony only if A knows that p\ntoo.\n\n(See Welbourne 1979, 1981, 1986, 1994; Hardwig 1985, 1991; A. Ross\n1986; Burge 1993, 1997; Plantinga 1993; Williamson 1996, 2000; Audi\n1997, 1998, 2006; Owens 2000, 2006; Reynolds 2002; Adler 2002;\nFaulkner 2006; Schmitt 2006).\n\n\nOne of the main motivations for the Transmission View comes from an\nalleged analogy between testimony and memory: Just as I cannot acquire\nmemorial knowledge that p today if I did not know that p\nat some earlier point in time, I cannot acquire testimonial knowledge\nthat p from you today if you do not know that p\nyourself. (But see Barnett 2015 for a recent discussion of the\nimportant differences between memory and testimony, and see Lackey\n2005b for why memory can generate knowledge.)\n\nDespite the intuitive and theoretical appeal, the Transmission View\nhas challenged in a variety of ways.\n2.2 The Generation View\n\nOpponents have raised two importantly different kinds of arguments\nagainst TV-N. First, suppose that there is a creationist teacher,\nStella, who does not believe, and thus fails to know, that homo\nsapiens evolved from homo erectus (= p). That is,\nwhile Stella has read the relevant text books on evolutionary theory,\nher creationist commitments prevent her from believing that p\nis true. Now, suppose that during one of her biology lessons Stella\ntells her fourth grade students that p, and suppose that her\nstudents come to believe that p on the basis of Stella\u2019s\ntestimony.\n\nThe argument here is that the fourth graders can come to know that\np on the basis of Stella\u2019s testimony even though Stella\nherself does not believe, and thus does not know, that p is\ntrue. Thus, TV-N is false, i.e., testimonial knowledge can be\ngenerated from a speaker who lacks the knowledge in question.\n(This Creationist Teacher case comes from Lackey (2008). Other school\nteacher cases have been discussed in Graham (2006a) and Carter and\nNickel (2014). Goldberg (2005) and Pelling (2013) also give cases in\nwhich a speaker\u2019s belief is unsafe and does not amount to\nknowledge even though the hearer\u2019s belief\n does).[6]\n\nWhile this first case involved a speaker who did not know that\np because they did not believe it, the second type of objection\nto TV-N involves a speaker who does not know that p because\nthey are not justified in believing it. For instance, consider Persia,\nwho is a persistent believer in the following sense: Persia goes to\nher eye doctor, Eyal, who tells her that the eye drops she was just\ngiven will make her vision unreliable for the next three hours. While\nEyal is a highly reliable testifier, he is wrong on this occasion,\ni.e., for some strange reason, the drops did not have this side-effect\non Persia. However, while Persia has no reason to distrust Eyal, she\nignores him on this occasion, walks out of his office, and sees a\nBadger in the parking lot. Because Persia is a persistent believer,\nshe forms the true belief that there is a badger in the parking lot\ndespite Eyal\u2019s (misleading) testimony about the unreliability of\nher visual faculties. Later that day Persia runs into her friend,\nFred, and tells him that there was a badger in the parking lot (=\np).\n\nThe argument here is that Eyal\u2019s testimony constitutes an\nundefeated defeater that defeats Persia\u2019s justification for\nbelieving that p. However, since Fred is completely unaware\nthat Persia has the defeater, and because he has positive reasons for\nthinking that his friend is a reliable testifier, he does come to know\nthat p on the basis of Persia\u2019s say-so. Thus, TV-N is\nfalse (This Persistent Believer case comes from Lackey [2008]. It is\nworth noting that this case purports to show that testimonial\njustification can also be generated, i.e., Fred can acquire\ntestimonial justification for believing p via Persia\u2019s\ntestimony even though Persia was not justified in believing p\nherself).\n\nIn addition to targeting TV-N, opponents of the Transmission View have\nalso targeted TV-S. Consider for instance, Quinn, who is so infatuated\nwith his friend, Kevin, that he is compulsively trusting, i.e., Quinn\nbelieves anything that Kevin says, regardless of how outrageous\nKevin\u2019s claim may be. One day Kevin testifies to Quinn that he\nis moving to Brooklyn (= p). Kevin is being truthful, and he\nhas terrific evidence that p is true (he is the one who is\nmoving, after all). Unsurprisingly, Quinn believes what Kevin says.\nHowever, Quinn would also have believed Kevin even if he had massive\namounts of evidence that Kevin was lying, or joking, or whatever.\n\nOpponents argue that while Kevin knows that p, Quinn does not,\ni.e., because of his compulsively trusting nature, Quinn\u2019s\nattitude is insensitive to counterevidence in a way that precludes his\nbelief from being amounting to knowledge. Thus, TV-S is false. (This\nCompulsively Trusting case comes from Lackey 2008. See also Graham\n2000b).\n\nMuch of the recent work on whether testimony generates or transmits\nknowledge concerns carefully distinguishing between different versions\nof TV-N and TV-S, and arguing that while some versions may face the\nproblems mentioned here, others do not. See, e.g., Wright (2016a).\n3. Testimony and Evidence\n\nConsider this scenario: Your friend testifies to you that the taco\ntruck is open. Because you know that your friend is almost always\nright about this kind of thing, and because you have no reason to\ndoubt what they are telling you on this occasion, you believe what you\nare told.\n\nWhile it is uncontroversial that your belief is justified in this\ncase, scenarios like this one have generated lots of debate about the\nfollowing question:\n\n\nThird Big Question: When a hearer is justified in believing\nthat p on the basis of a speaker\u2019s testimony, is the\nhearer\u2019s belief justified by evidence? And if the hearer\u2019s\nbelief is justified by evidence, where does this evidence come\nfrom?\n\n3.1 Evidential Views\n\nSome epistemologists maintain that our testimonially based beliefs are\njustified by evidence. However, there is disagreement about where\nexactly this evidence comes from. On the one hand, some maintain that\nthis evidence must be supplied by the hearer. On the other hand, some\nmaintain that this evidence must be supplied by the speaker. Let us\nconsider these two views in turn.\n3.1.1 Reductionist Views\n\nAs we saw in\n Section 1,\n Reductionists maintain that because a hearer must have positive\nreasons for accepting a speaker\u2019s testimony, testimonial\njustification can be reduced to a combination of other epistemic\nresources that the hearer possesses, i.e., the hearer\u2019s\nmemorial, perceptual, and inferential capacities. For this reason,\nReductionists can maintain that a hearer\u2019s testimonial-based\nbeliefs are justified by evidence, where this evidence comes from the\nhearer\u2019s inferences, i.e., inferences from the premise that the\nspeaker said that p, to the conclusion that p is\ntrue.\n\nHowever, as we also saw in\n Section 1,\n Reductionists face a number of difficult challenges. For this reason,\nthose who are sympathetic with an evidential approach to testimonial\njustification have offered an alternative account of how our\ntestimonially based beliefs are justified.\n3.1.2 The Inheritance View \n\nInstead of thinking about testimonial justification in terms of the\nevidence that a hearer possesses, some have offered an alternative\naccount in which the hearer\u2019s belief is justified by evidence\nthat is supplied by the speaker. More specifically, consider\n\n\nThe Inheritance\n View:[7]\n If a hearer acquires testimonial justification for believing that\np on the basis of a speaker\u2019s testimony, then the\nhearer\u2019s belief that p is justified by whatever evidence\nis justifying the speaker\u2019s belief that p. (See, e.g.,\nBurge 1993,\n 1997;[8]\n McDowell 1994; Owens 2000, 2006; Schmitt 2006; Faulkner 2011; and\nWright 2015, 2016b, 2016c,\n 2019[9]).\n\n\n(It is worth noting that while this debate about evidence and\njustification is importantly different from the debate between\nReductionists and Anti-Reductionists, some of the biggest proponents\nof the Inheritance View also endorse Anti-Reductionism, e.g., Burge\n1993, 1997.)\n\nTo begin to get a handle on the Inheritance View, suppose that you are\njustified in believing that the taco truck is busy because your friend\njust told you so. And suppose that your friend\u2019s belief is\njustified by some excellent evidence, i.e., they are standing in front\nof the truck and can see the long lineup. According to the Inheritance\nview, the evidence that justifies your belief comes from, or is based\non, the very same evidence that justifies your friend\u2019s belief,\ni.e., your belief is based on your friend\u2019s perception of a huge\ngroup of people waiting to order tacos.\n\nOr, consider this example from David Owens (2006: 120): Suppose that\nyou are justified in believing that some math theorem, T, is true\nbecause you just proved it yourself on the basis of some impeccable\na priori reasoning. If you testify to me that T is true such\nthat I come to acquire testimonial justification for believing that\nthis is the case, then according to the Inheritance View, my belief is\nalso based on your impeccable a priori\n reasoning.[10]\n\nNow, while many epistemologists are sympathetic to the idea that your\ntestimonial-based beliefs are justified by evidence, they disagree\nthat the evidence in question is literally inherited from the speaker.\nHere are two reasons why.\n\nThe first objection starts with the observation that a hearer can\nacquire testimonial justification for believing p even though\nthe speaker\u2019s evidence does not justify them in believing\np. For instance, suppose that after an eye exam your\noptometrist tells you that your eyes will be dilated for a few hours\nand that your visual faculties will be unreliable during this time.\nSuppose also that as you are walking home it appears to you that there\nis a small puppy playing fetch in a field (= p). Thus, because\nyou decide to completely and irrationally ignore what your doctor\nsaid, you decide to believe that p. Finally, suppose that\nunbeknownst to you, your doctor was a bit off and the effects of the\neye medication have worn off such that your eyes are now functioning\nin a highly reliable way.\n\nHere it seems like your total evidence does not justify you in\nbelieving p. After all, given what your doctor said, you ought\nto think that your vision is still unreliable, i.e., your\ndoctor\u2019s testimony provides you with a defeater that makes it\nirrational for you to believe that what you are looking at is a small\npuppy (as opposed to, say, a really big kitten or an average sized\nraccoon).\n\nBut, suppose that you decide to call and tell me that p anyway.\nInsofar as your visual faculties are actually working great, and\ninsofar as I have no reason to think that your vision is screwed up,\nit does seem like I can acquire testimonial justification for\nbelieving that p on the basis of your say-so.\n\nAnd herein lies the problem. For if the Inheritance View is true, then\nI could not acquire testimonial justification on the basis of what you\ntold me. After all, if your total evidence does not justify you in\nbelieving p, and if my belief is literally based on the\nevidence that you have, then I could not be justified in believing\np either. But since I do seem to acquire testimonial\njustification for believing that p in this case, the\nInheritance View is false. (This objection comes from Lackey\u2019s\n[2008] Persistent Believer case. Graham (2006b) gives a similar\nobjection, and Pelling (2013) offers a case in which a hearer seems to\nacquire testimonial justification from a speaker who has no good\nreason to believe what they say, but does so anyway on the basis of an\nirrational hunch.)\n\nTo see the second problem with the Inheritance View, notice that a\nhearer can receive testimony from multiple speakers who each have\nexcellent evidence for believing that p, but where their\nevidence conflicts in an important sense. For instance, suppose that\ntwo detectives are investigating who stole the curry from\nSonya\u2019s restaurant. And suppose that the first detective, Dell,\nhas excellent evidence that justifies him in believing that that Steph\nis the only one who committed the crime. Thus, Dell infers that there\nis exactly one culprit. Moreover, suppose that the second detective,\nDoris, has excellent evidence that justifies her in believing that\nSeth is the only one who committed the crime. Thus, Doris also infers\nthat there is exactly one culprit.\n\nNow, suppose that while Dell does testify to you that there is exactly\none thief, he does not fill you in on the evidence that he has for\nthinking this. And suppose while Doris also tells you that there is\nexactly one thief, she does not fill you in on the evidence that she\nhas for thinking this either. Even so, it seems like you are clearly\njustified in believing that there is exactly one culprit on the basis\nof what these detectives have told you. However\u2014and herein lies\nthe problem\u2014if the Inheritance View is true, then it is hard to\nsee how you could be justified in believing this. After all, you have\ninherited Dell\u2019s evidence for believing that there is exactly\none culprit (i.e., his evidence for thinking that Steph is guilty),\nand you have also inherited Doris\u2019 evidence for thinking that\nthere is exactly one culprit (i.e., her evidence for thinking that\nSeth is guilty). But taken together, your combined body of evidence\nconflicts in the sense that it does not justify you in thinking that\nthere is exactly one thief. Thus, the Inheritance View is false. See\nLeonard\n (2018).[11]\n3.2 Non-Evidential Views\n\nInstead of further developing these evidential views, some\nepistemologists maintain that our testimonial-based beliefs are not\njustified by evidence. More specifically, some argue that testimonial\njustification should be understood in terms of non-evidential\nassurances, while others contend that it should be understood in terms\nof the reliability of the processes that produced the belief in\nquestion. Let us consider both of these positions in turn.\n3.2.1 The Assurance View\n\nAccording to proponents of the Assurance View (also called the\nInterpersonal View), the problem with all of the theories discussed\nabove is that they do not appreciate the epistemological significance\nof the interpersonal relationship that obtains between a speaker and\ntheir audience in a testimonial exchange. More specifically,\nconsider\n\n\nThe Assurance View: Because of the interpersonal relationship\nthat obtains in a testimonial exchange, if a hearer acquires\ntestimonial justification for believing that p on the basis of\na speaker\u2019s say-so, then the hearer\u2019s belief is justified,\nat least in\n part,[12]\n by the speaker\u2019s assurance, where this assurance is\nnon-evidential in nature. (A. Ross 1986; Hinchman 2005, 2014;\nMoran 2005, 2018; Faulkner 2007, 2011; Zagzebski 2012; and McMyler\n2011).\n\n\nIn order to get a handle on this view, there are two things that need\nunpacking here. First, how should we understand the nature of the\ninterpersonal relationship that is said to obtain in a testimonial\nexchange? And second, why is testimonial justification non-evidential\nin nature? Let us consider these questions in turn.\n\nFirst, proponents of the Assurance View maintain that the speech act\nof telling is key to understanding the relationship that a\nspeaker has with their audience. This is because when a speaker\ntells their audience that p is true, she is doing much\nmore than merely uttering p. Rather, she is inviting her\naudience to trust her that p is true; that is, she is assuring,\nor guaranteeing her audience that p is the case. More\nspecifically, in order for a hearer to acquire testimonial\njustification, the speaker must tell them that p is true, where\ntelling is understood along the following lines:\n\n\nTelling: S tells A that p iff\n\nA recognizes that S, in asserting that p,\nintends:\nthat A gain access to an epistemic reason to believe that\np,\nthat A recognize S\u2019s (ii)-intention, and\nthat A gain access to the epistemic reason to believe that\np as a direct result of A\u2019s recognition of\nS\u2019s (ii)-intention (Hinchman 2005: 567).\n\n\n\nThe idea is that when your friend testifies to you that the ice cream\nshop is open (= p), they are not merely uttering something;\nrather, they are telling you that p. And by telling\nyou that p, they are thereby assuring you that this\nreally is the\n case.[13]\n\nThus, when your friend tells you that p, i.e., when conditions\n(i)\u2013(iv) are satisfied, they have established an important,\ninterpersonal relationship with you, and you alone. This is because\nyou are the only one that has been assured by your friend that\np is true.\n\nIt is in this sense, then, that proponents of the Assurance View\nmaintain that there is an important interpersonal relationship that\nobtains between a speaker and their audience.\n\nThis brings us to the second key question about the Assurance View:\nEven if testimony should be understood in terms of the speech act of\ntelling, why does this mean that testimonial justification cannot be\nunderstood in terms of evidence?\n\nThe idea here is that when your friend tells you that p, they\nare assuring you that p is true, and that this assurance is\nwhat is justifying your belief. Moreover\u2014and this is the\nkey\u2014these assurances are non-evidential in nature.\n\nHere is one way that proponents of the Assurance View have argued for\nthis claim: a piece of evidence, e, counts in favor of a proposition,\np, regardless of what anyone intends (e.g., my fingerprint at\nthe ice cream shop is evidence that I was there regardless of whether\nI wanted to leave the print behind); but a speaker\u2019s assurance\nthat p only counts in favor of p because they intended\nit to, i.e., a speaker cannot unintentionally assure you of anything;\nthus, the assurances that justify your testimonial-based beliefs are\nnon-evidential in\n nature.[14]\n\nIt is for this reason, then, that proponents of the Assurance View\nmaintain that testimonial justification cannot be understood in terms\nof evidence.\n\nHowever, the Assurance View is not without problems of its own. One\nobjection is that it is unclear how these non-evidential assurances\ncan actually justify one\u2019s belief. For instance, suppose that\nonce again your friend tells you that the ice cream shop is\nopen (= p). But suppose that unbeknownst to both of you, Evelyn\nis eavesdropping on the conversation. Thus, while your friend does not\nissue Evelyn an assurance (namely because they do not intend for her\nto believe what they say and thus fail to satisfy conditions\n(i)\u2013(iv) in Telling), Evelyn clearly hears what your\nfriend says. Finally, suppose that you and Evelyn are equally reliable\nconsumers of testimony, that both of have the same background\ninformation about your friend, and that neither of you have any reason\nto doubt what your friend says on this occasion.\n\nThe key question here is this: Insofar as you and Evelyn both believe\nthat p because of what your friend said, epistemically\nspeaking, is there any sense in which your belief is better off than\nEvelyn\u2019s?\n\nGiven the details of the case, it is hard to see what the important\ndifference could be. Thus\u2014and herein lies the problem\u2014even\nthough you were issued an assurance and Evelyn was not, the assurance\nin question seems epistemically superfluous, i.e., it makes no\ndifference to the epistemic status of one\u2019s belief. Thus,\nproponents of the Assurance View must explain how assurances can\njustify one\u2019s beliefs, given that they seem epistemically inert.\n(This case comes from Lackey 2008. Owens 2006 and Schmitt 2010 raise\nsimilar worries).\n\nA second problem is that in order to make the case that testimonial\njustification is non-evidential in nature, proponents of the Assurance\nView have over-cognized what is involved in a testimonial\nexchange.\n\nTo see why, notice that Telling requires that the speaker and\nthe hearer both have the cognitive capacity to recognize that other\npeople have higher-order mental states, i.e., both parties\nmust be cognitively capable of recognizing that people have mental\nstates about other people\u2019s mental states. For instance, in\norder for you to satisfy all of the conditions in Telling,\nyou must believe (that your friend intends [that you\nbelieve (that your friend is intending [that you\nacquire an epistemic reason for belief because you recognizes that you\nfriend is intending to offer one)]). But decades of literature in\ndevelopmental psychology suggest that for neuro-typical children, the\nability to recognize that people have higher order mental states is\nnot acquired until around five or six years old. Moreover, this\nliterature also suggests that for people with autism, the ability to\ndo this is not acquired until much later in life, if it is acquired at\nall. Thus, insofar as young children and people with autism can\nacquire testimonial justification from their parents, say, then the\nAssurance View should be rejected on the grounds that it\nproblematically excludes these people from acquiring something of\nepistemic importance. See Leonard (2016).\n3.2.2 Testimonial Reliabilism\n\nTestimonial Reliabilists also deny that our testimonial-based beliefs\nare justified by evidence. But instead of claiming that they are\njustified by non-evidential assurances, the idea is that:\n\n\nTestimonial\n Reliabilism:[15]\n A hearer\u2019s testimonial justification consists in the\nreliability of the processes involved in the production of the\nhearer\u2019s testimonially-based belief. (See, e.g., Graham 2000a,\n2000b,\n 2006a;[16]\n Goldberg 2010a; and Sosa 2010).\n\n\nTo get a better handle on this view, suppose that your friend tells\nyou that the concert starts in an hour and that you thereby acquire\ntestimonial justification for believing that this is the case. In very\nbroad strokes, Testimonial Reliabilists can explain the nature of your\njustification as follows: When it comes to concerts, your friend\ntestifies truly almost all of the time; moreover, you are great at\ndifferentiating cases in which your friend is speaking honestly and\nwhen she is trying to deceive you; thus, you have testimonial\njustification in this case because the processes involved in the\nproduction and consumption of the testimony in question are highly\nreliable.\n\nIt is worth noting that there are at least two important processes\ninvolved in a testimonial exchange. First, there are the processes\ninvolved in the production of the speaker\u2019s testimony, i.e., the\nprocesses that are relevant to the likelihood that the testifier\nspeaks the truth. Second, there are the processes involved in the\nhearer\u2019s consumption of the testimony, i.e., the processes\ninvolved in the hearer being able to monitor for signs that what the\nspeaker says is false or unlikely to be true. For this reason,\nTestimonial Reliabilism can be developed in a number of importantly\ndifferent ways. For instance, one could opt for a view according to\nwhich a hearer\u2019s testimonial justification for believing that\np is only a matter of the reliability of the processes involved\nin the production of the speaker\u2019s say-so. Or, one could opt for\na view according to which testimonial justification only amounts to\nthe reliability of the processes involved in the hearer\u2019s\nconsumption of the speaker\u2019s testimony. Or, one could also opt\nfor a view according to which all of the relevant processes matter.\nSee Graham (2000a, 2000b, 2006a), Goldberg (2010a), and Sosa (2010)\nfor recent defenses of Testimonial Reliabilism, and see\n Section 4\n for additional versions of this view as well.\n\nTestimonial Reliabilism is motivated by the considerations that\nsupport Reliabilist theories of justification more generally, as well\nas its ability to avoid the problems that plague the views discussed\nabove. Nevertheless, opponents have argued that Testimonial\nReliabilism faces at least two problems of its own.\n\nFirst, insofar as there are at least two processes involved in a\ntestimonial exchange, Testimonial Reliabilists are faced with the\nsubstantial challenge of specifying which of these processes are\nrelevant to the hearer\u2019s testimonial justification, i.e.,\nTestimonial Reliabilists must give an account of which processes are\nrelevant here, and they must do so in a way that captures every\ninstance in which a hearer intuitively acquires testimonial\njustification from a speaker. (See Wright 2019, who argues that this\nis not merely an instance of the generality problem that poses a worry\nfor Reliabilist views of justification more generally).\n\nSecond, consider cases that involve one hearer and two\nsources of information. For instance, suppose that Rebecca, who\nis in fact a reliable testifier, tells you that traffic on I405 is\nbad. And suppose also that Umar, who is in fact an unreliable\ntestifier, tells you that traffic on I90 is all clear. Finally,\nsuppose that you do not have any reason to prefer one source of\ninformation over the other, i.e., for all you know, Rebecca and Umar\nare equally reliable testifiers.\n\nNow, consider the versions of Testimonial Reliabilism according to\nwhich the processes that are relevant to acquisition of testimonial\njustification are those that are involved in the speaker\u2019s\nproduction of the testimony in question, as well as the hearer\u2019s\nability to discern when the speaker is being sincere. It seems that\nthese Testimonial Reliabilists are committed to giving an\nasymmetric verdict in this case; that is, because the\nprocesses involved in the production of your belief based on\nRebecca\u2019s testimony are reliable, and because the processes\ninvolved in the production of your belief based on Umar\u2019s\ntestimony are not, this version of Testimonial Reliabilism is\ncommitted to the claim that while you do have testimonial\njustification for believing that the traffic on 1405 is bad, you do\nnot have testimonial justification for believing that I90 is all\nclear.\n\nHowever, opponents have argued that this verdict is highly\ncounterintuitive. After all, how could you possibly be justified in\nbelieving Rebecca\u2019s testimony but not Umar\u2019s, given that\nyou have no reason to think that the former is in any way better than\nthe latter? Thus, this version of Testimonial Reliabilism should be\nrejected. See Barnett (2015).\n3.3 Hybrid Views\n\nWe have seen that the evidential and non-evidential views discussed\nabove offer very different takes on how our testimonial-based beliefs\nare justified. We have also seen that while these views have their\nadvantages, they face some serious problems as well. Consequently,\nsome epistemologists have argued that testimonial justification cannot\nbe explained in a unified way. Instead, the strategy has been to offer\nhybrid views that combine various components of the accounts discussed\nabove.\n\nFor instance, some have tried to combine Reductionist and Reliabilist\ninsights such that testimonial justification consists partly in the\nhearer\u2019s evidence for accepting the speaker\u2019s testimony,\nand partly in terms of the speaker\u2019s and hearer\u2019s\nreliability at producing and consuming testimony respectively, e.g.,\nLackey (2008). Others have tried to combine insights from\nReductionism, Reliabilism and the Inheritance View such that a\nhearer\u2019s belief can be justified by their own evidence for\naccepting what the speaker says, or by the reliability of the\nspeaker\u2019s testimony, or by inheriting the evidence that is\npossessed by the speaker, e.g., Wright (2019). (For other hybrid\nviews, see Gerken 2013 and Faulkner 2000).\n\nMuch of the recent work on testimonial justification concerns whether\nthese hybrid views ultimately succeed, or whether they run into\nproblems of their own.\n4. Individualism and Anti-Individualism\n\nConsider\n\n\nFourth Big Question: Should testimonial justification be\nunderstood individualistically, or anti- individualistically?\n\n\nSome epistemologists endorse\n\n\nIndividualism: A complete account of testimonial\njustification can be given by appealing to features that only have to\ndo with the hearer.\n\n\nOther epistemologists endorse\n\n\nAnti-Individualism: A complete account of testimonial\njustification cannot be given by only appealing to features that have\nto do with the hearer.\n\n\nFor instance, according to some Anti-Individualists, acquiring\ntestimonial justification involves features having to do with both the\nhearer and the speaker. And according to other Anti-Individualists,\nacquiring testimonial justification involves features having to do\nwith both the hearer and the other speakers in the hearer\u2019s\nlocal environment. For various defenses of Anti-Individualism, see,\ne.g., Graham (2000b), Lackey (2008), Goldberg (2010a), Kallestrup and\nPritchard (2012), Gerken (2013), Pritchard (2015), and Palermos\n(forthcoming).\n\n(Note: In formulating these two views, I am being deliberately\nopen-ended about how the \u201cfeatures\u201d in question should be\nunderstood. As we will see below, this is because the debate between\nIndividualists and Anti-Individualists cuts across the other debates\nabout testimonial justification that we have explored above.\nConsequently, different members of each camp will want to give\nimportantly different takes on what these features amount to.)\n4.1 Individualism\n\nSuppose that Amanda tells Scott that the roller rink is open (=\np) and that Scott thereby acquires testimonial justification\nfor believing that p.\n\nTo get a grip on one version of Individualism, recall the Reductionist\nviews discussed in\n Section 1.1.\n According to Reductionists, testimonial justification consists in an\ninference that the hearer makes, i.e., the hearer\u2019s inference\nfrom the claim that (a) the speaker said that p to the\nconclusion that (b) p is true. Thus, Reductionists are\nIndividualists in the following sense: they maintain that whether or\nnot a hearer acquires testimonial justification for believing p\ndepends entirely on features having to do with the hearer, where these\nfeatures include, e.g., the hearer\u2019s perception of the speaker\nuttering p, the hearer remembering that testimony is generally\nreliable, and the hearer inferring on these grounds that what the\nspeaker said on this occasion is likely to be true.\n\nTo see a second version of Individualism, recall the our discussion of\nTestimonial Reliabilism in\n Section 3.2.2.\n According to some (but certainly not all) Testimonial Reliabilists,\ntestimonial justification should be understood Individualistically\nbecause it consists only in the reliability of the cognitive processes\nthat are internal to the hearer, i.e., the cognitive processes that\ntake place exclusively in the mind of the hearer herself. See Alvin\nGoldman (1979, 1986) and Alston (1994, 1995).\n\nWhile we have seen a variety of problems for both of these views\nabove, it is worth considering one challenge to this individualistic\nversion of Testimonial Reliabilism in particular. Doing so will not\nonly help shed light on why some Testimonial Reliabilists opt for an\nanti-individualistic view, it will also help illustrate how the debate\nabout Individualism and Anti-Individualism cuts across the other\ndebates we have considered above.\n\nTo begin, consider these two cases from Goldberg (2010a):\n\n\nGood: Wilma has known Fred for a long time; she knows\nthat he is a highly reliable speaker. So when Fred tells her that\nBarney has been at the stonecutters\u2019 conference all day, Wilma\nbelieves him. (Fred appeared to her as sincere and competent as he\nnormally does, and she found nothing remiss with the testimony.) In\npoint of fact, Fred spoke from knowledge.\n\nBad: Wilma has known Fred for a long time; she knows\nthat he is a highly reliable speaker. So when Fred tells her that\nBarney has been at the stonecutters\u2019 conference all day, Wilma\nbelieves him. (Fred appeared to her as sincere and competent as he\nnormally does, and she found nothing remiss with the testimony.)\nHowever, in this case, Fred did not speak from knowledge. Instead, he\nwas just making up a story about Barney, having had ulterior motives\nin getting Wilma to believe this story. (Fred has never done this\nbefore; it is out of his normally reliable character to do such a\nthing.) Even so, Fred\u2019s speech contribution struck Wilma here,\nas in the good scenario, as sincere and competent; and she was not\nepistemically remiss in reaching this verdict\u2026 As luck would\nhave it, though, Barney was in fact at the conference all day (though\nFred, of course, did not know this).\n\n\nContrasting these two cases motivates the following line of thought:\nIt seems like Wilma knows that Barney was at the stonecutters\u2019\nconference (= p) in Good but not in\nBad. It also seems like the cognitive processes that\nare internal to Wilma are the same across both cases. Thus, insofar as\njustification is what turns an unGettiered, true belief into\nknowledge, and insofar as Wilma\u2019s unGettiered, true belief that\np amounts to knowledge in Good but not in\nBad, the cognitive processes involved in the\nacquisition of testimonial justification cannot just be the ones that\nare internal to Wilma. Thus, Testimonial Reliabilists should not\nendorse Individualism. See Goldberg (2010a) for this argument.\n4.2 Anti-Individualism\n\nContrasting the Good and Bad cases\nhas motivated some Testimonial Reliabilists to endorse one version of\nAnti-Individualism. The core idea here is that insofar as testimonial\njustification should be understood in terms of the cognitive processes\nimplicated in the production of the hearer\u2019s belief that\np, the relevant processes must include both (a) the processes\ninvolved in the production of the speaker\u2019s testimony and (b)\nthe processes involved in the hearer\u2019s consumption of what the\nspeaker said. For instance, the cognitive processes internal to Wilma\nwere the highly reliable in both Good and\nBad, e.g., in both cases she was equally good at\nmonitoring for signs that Barney was being insincere. However, the\nprocesses internal to Barney that were implicated in his utterance\nthat p were reliable in Good (i.e., Barney\nspoke from knowledge) but unreliable in Bad (i.e.,\nBarney uttered that p in an attempt to be deceptive). Thus, by\ngiving an account of testimonial justification that requires both the\nspeaker and hearer to be reliable producers and consumers of testimony\nrespectively, Testimonial Reliabilists who endorse this\nAnti-Individualistic approach can explain why Wilma\u2019s belief\nseems better off in Good than it is in\nBad. (Goldberg [2010a] defends Anti-Individualism on\nthese grounds, and Graham (2000b) and Lackey (2008) also defend\nAnti-Individualistic views by requiring that in order for a hearer to\nacquire testimonial justification, not only does the hearer need to be\na reliable consumer of testimony, the speaker needs to be a reliable\ntestifier as well. Finally, Kallestrup and Pritchard (2012), Gerken\n(2013), Pritchard (2015), and Palermos (forthcoming) have recently\ndefended versions of Anti-Individualism according to which the\ntestifiers in the hearer\u2019s local environment need to be reliable\nin order for the hearer to acquire testimonial knowledge from the\nparticular speaker in question).\n\nTo see a second and importantly different version of\nAnti-Individualism, recall the Inheritance View from\n Section 3.1.2.\n On this view, when a hearer acquires testimonial justification for\nbelieving p, this is because they literally inherit the\njustification that the speaker has for believing p. Thus,\nproponents of the Inheritance View are Anti-Individualists in the\nfollowing sense: they maintain that whether or not a hearer acquires\ntestimonial justification for believing p crucially depends on\nfeatures having to do with the speaker, i.e., whether the speaker has\nany justification for the hearer to inherit.\n\nWhether or not either of these Anti-Individualistic approaches will\nultimately succeed is a topic of current debate.\n\nBefore moving on, it is worth noting that while we have been focusing\non testimonial justification, similar debates between\nIndividualists and Anti-Individualists can be had about testimonial\nknowledge. While many epistemologists endorse Individualism\n(Anti-Individualism) about both justification and knowledge, one need\nnot do so. For instance, Audi (1997) endorses Reductionism about\njustification and the Transmission View about knowledge. On this\npicture, then, Individualism is true with respect to justification\nbecause whether or not a hearer acquires testimonial justification\ndepends solely on the inferences that they make. However,\nAnti-Individualism is true with respect to knowledge because in order\nfor a hearer to acquire testimonial knowledge that p, the\nspeaker must also know that p. Keeping these distinctions in\nmind further illustrates how the debate between Individualists and\nAnti-Individualists cuts across so many of the other debates we have\nseen above.\n5. Authoritative Testimony\n\nHere is a conversation that we might have:\n\n\nYou: This plant is Pacific Poison Oak. Don\u2019t touch it!\nMe: How do you know that?\nYou: Suneet told me. He lives in this area a knows a little bit\nabout plants.\n\n\n\nAnd here is another:\n\n\nYou: This plant is Pacific Poison Oak. Don\u2019t touch it!\nMe: How do you know that?\nYou: Margae told me. She has a PhD in plant biology and studies\nthis plant in particular.\n\n\n\nIn both cases you have acquired testimonial knowledge. But in the\nsecond case it seems like your belief is better off, epistemically\nspeaking. This is because in the first case your belief is based on\nthe testimony of a layman who is somewhat knowledgeable about the\ntopic at hand, whereas in the second case your belief is based on the\ntestimony of an epistemic authority (or, someone who is both\nyour epistemic superior and an expert about the domain in question).\n(See Zagzebski 2012; J\u00e4ger 2016; Croce 2018; and Constantin &\nGrundmann 2020 for more on how the notion of an epistemic authority\nshould be understood.)\n\nBut how exactly should the difference between epistemic authorities\nand everyone else be accounted for?\n\nBroadly speaking, those working on the epistemology of authoritative\ntestimony endorse one of two accounts: Preemptive Accounts\nand Non-Preemptive Accounts. Those who endorse a Preemptive\nAccount of authoritative testimony accept\n\n\nPreemption: The fact that an authority\u2026 [testifies]\nthat p is a reason for me to believe that p which\nreplaces my other reasons relevant to p and is not simply added\nto them. (Zagzebski 2012: 107)\n\n\nThe key idea here is that when you get testimony from an authority\nthat p, the authority\u2019s testimony is now the only reason\nthat you have for believing p, i.e., any other reasons you may\nhave had are now preempted in the sense that they no longer count for\nor against p. Proponents of the Preemptive Account, then,\nexplain the difference between authoritative and non-authoritative\ntestimony as follows: Authoritative testimony can provide you with a\npreemptive reason for belief, whereas non-authoritative testimony\ncannot. For defenses of various versions of the Preemptive Account,\nsee Zagzebski (2012, 2014, 2016), Keren (2007, 2014a, 2014b), Croce\n(2018) and Constantin and Grundmann (2020). See Anderson (2014),\nDougherty (2014), J\u00e4ger (2016), Dormandy (2018), and Lackey\n(2018a) for some worries with this view.\n\nThose who endorse a Non-Preemptive Account of authoritative testimony\nargue that Preemption has wildly unintuitive consequences, e.g., if\nPreemption is true, then you can be justified in believing your pastor\n(who is otherwise reliable) when he tells you that women are\ninherently inferior to men (see, e.g., Lackey 2018a). Instead of\nthinking about authoritative testimony as providing preemptive reasons\nfor belief, proponents of the Non-Preemptive Account take an\nauthority\u2019s testimony that p to provide a very strong\nreason to believe that p, where this reason is to be added to,\nor combined with, all of the other reasons that you have related to\nthe proposition in question. See Dormandy (2018) and Lackey (2018a)\nfor defenses of Non-Preemptive Accounts.\n\nFor related debates about testimony and expertise, see Hardwig\u2019s\n(1985) seminal paper on expert testimony in general, Alvin\nGoldman\u2019s (2001) paper on determining which experts to trust\nwhen there is disagreement amongst them, and Goldberg\u2019s (2009)\npaper that links issues in epistemology and philosophy of language by\ndiscussing how expert testimony bears on the semantics of technical\nterms. See also Kitcher (1993), Walton (1997), Brewer (1998) and\nGolanski (2001) for a discussion of expert testimony in the scientific\nsetting, and for discussion of expert testimony in a legal setting,\nsee Wells and Olson (2003).\n6. Group Testimony\n\nWhile much attention has been paid to issues surrounding\nindividual testimony, i.e., cases in which one speaker tells\nsomeone that p is true, recently epistemologists have started\nexploring a number of related questions regarding group\ntestimony, i.e., cases in which a group testifies to someone that\np is true. Here is one case that motivates this line of\nresearch.\n\n\nPopulation Commission: Consider the UN Population\nCommission that was established by the Economic and Social Council of\nthe United Nations in 1946. The Commission was designed to assist the\ncouncil by arranging studies and advising the council on population\nissues, trends, developments, policies, and so on. It is also charged\nwith monitoring the implementation of policies designed by the United\nNations to regulate population and to provide recommendations to the\ncouncil and United Nations as a whole. The commission is composed of\n47 members with a representative from almost every country in the\nUnited Nations. In 2002, the Commission released a report entitled\nCharting the Progress of Populations that provides information on 12\nsocio-economic indicators, including total population, maternal\nmortality, infant mortality, and so on. (Tollefsen 2007:\n300\u2013301)\n\n\nThere are three things to notice here. First, consider a particular\nclaim in the Charting the Progress of Populations report. For\ninstance, let p be the claim that\n\n\nWhile the population in North America has risen, the population in\nCentral America has stayed the same, and the population in South\nAmerica has declined.\n\n\nAt the time the report was released, no single member of the UN\nPopulation committee believed p. That is, none of the committee\nmembers were aware that p was true until the report was\nreleased and they read it for themselves.\n\nSecond, and relatedly, before the report was released, none of the\ncommittee members had any evidence, or justification, for believing\np. That is, while some members might have justifiably believed\nthat the population in North America was on the rise, and while others\nmight have justifiably believed that the population in South America\nwas on the decline, and while others still might have justifiably\nbelieved that the population in Central America had stayed the same,\ngiven the way in which the labor was divided amongst the researchers,\ni.e., given that none of them had communicated their findings with one\nanother, nobody had justification for thinking that p itself\nwas true until after the report came out.\n\nThird, and finally, the UN Commission did seem to testify that\np, i.e., their report did contain the group\u2019s testimony\nabout the population changes in the Americas.\n\n(Of course, this is not the only case that motivates the need for an\nepistemology of group testimony. Wikipedia, for instance,\npresents a number of interesting questions about what it would take\nfor a group to testify, and when and why we should accept what a group\nsays. See, e.g., Tollefsen 2009; Wray 2009; and Fallis 2008. Cases\ninvolving testimony from scientific groups also raise similar issues.\nSee, e.g., Hardwig 1985 and Faulkner 2018).\n\nCases like this give rise to at least five important questions. First,\nconsider\n\n\nHow should we understand the relationship between a group\u2019s\ntestimony that p and the testimony of the group\u2019s\nindividual members?\n\n\nOn the one hand, Summativists maintain that a group\u2019s\ntestimony that p should be understood in terms of the testimony\nof some (or most, or all) of its members. On the other hand,\nNon-Summativists maintain that it is possible for a group to\ntestify that p even if none of its members do. (See Tollefsen\n(2007) and Lackey (2014) for a defense of different Non-Summative\npositions).\n\nRelatedly, Deflationists maintain to a group\u2019s\ntestimony that p can be reduced to some individual\u2019s\ntestimony that p (regardless of whether those individuals are\nmembers of the group, or just mere spokesmen), whereas\nInflationists maintain that a group itself can be a\ntestifier. (See Tollefsen (2007) for a defense of the latter, and see\nLackey\u2019s (2014) for a deflationary account of the epistemology\nof group testimony and her (2018a) for an inflationary account of the\nnature of group assertion).\n\nSecond, consider\n\n\nUnder what conditions is a hearer justified in believing a\ngroup\u2019s testimony that p?\n\n\nThe debate surrounding this question is analogous to the\nReductionist/Anti-reductionist debate about individual testimony in\n Section 1.\n See Tollefsen (2007) for a defense of a reductionist view.\n\nThird, consider\n\n\nIf you are justified in believing that p on the basis of a\ngroup\u2019s testimony, is your belief justified by\nevidence?\n\n\nThe debate surrounding this question is analogous to the debates about\nindividual testimony discussed in\n Section 3.\n For instance, suppose that you are justified in believing that\np on the basis of a group\u2019s testimony that p.\nMiranda Fricker (2012) defends an Assurance View according to which\nyour belief is justified by the group\u2019s assurance that p\n(but see Faulkner (2018) for a criticism of this view). Lackey (2014)\ndefends a reliabilist account according to which your belief is\njustified by the reliability (or truth conduciveness) of the\ngroup\u2019s statement that p (but see Faulkner (2018) for a\ncriticism of this view too). Finally, Faulkner (2018) defends a\nqualified Inheritance View according to which your belief that\np can be justified by the justification that the group has (or\nat least has access to).\n\nFourth, consider,\n\n\nCan group testimony generate knowledge, or can it merely transmit\nit?\n\n\nThe debate surrounding this question is analogous to the debates about\nindividual testimony in\n Section 2.\n On the one hand, Faulkner (2018) defends a qualified Transmission\nView according to which you can only acquire testimonial knowledge and\njustification from a group\u2019s testimony that p if that\ngroup has, or at least has access to, a body of justification\nthat supports p. On the other hand, Lackey (2014) defends a\nview that is compatible with a group\u2019s testimony generating\nknowledge and justification.\n\nFifth, and finally, consider,\n\n\nWhat, if anything, does a group\u2019s testimony that p\nentail about that group\u2019s knowledge (and thus belief) that\np?\n\n\nMore specifically, suppose that a group testifies that p and\nthat you come to know that p on this basis. Does the fact that\nyou acquired testimonial knowledge in this case entail that groups\nthemselves can be knowers (and thus believers)?\n\nOn the one hand, John Hardwig (1985) argues for a positive answer\nhere. That is, Hardwig argues that if we acknowledge that groups can\ntestify, we should also acknowledge that groups themselves can be\nknowers, and thus believers too (see also Lackey (2016) for an\nargument to the effect that groups can possess justified beliefs). On\nthe other hand, Faulkner (2018) argues against this line of thought\nand suggests that even if groups can testify, this does not entail\nthat they possess any mental states.\n\nOf course, there is much more work that can, and should, be done about\nthe epistemological significance of receiving testimony from\ngroups.\n7. The Nature of Testimony Itself\n\nUntil now we have been operating with an intuitive but inexact notion\nof what counts as testimony, i.e., for the most part, we have just\nbeen looking at cases in which speakers say stuff. But how exactly\nshould the speech act of testimony be understood? That is, how should\ntestimony be individuated from the other things that one can do with\ntheir words?\n\nOne answer is that testimony should simply be identified with\nassertion, i.e., one testifies that p if, and only if, one\nasserts that p. (E. Fricker 1987 and Sosa (1994) offer passing\nremarks in defense of this position). But while it is widely accepted\nthat one must assert that p in order to testify that p,\nthere is much debate about whether asserting that p is\nsufficient for testifying that p. (See Goldberg 2010b, though,\nwho argues that asserting that p is not even necessary for\ntestifying that p, and see the entry on Assertion for more\nabout how this speech act should be understood).\n\nFor instance, in addition to asserting that p, one influential\naccount maintains that in order to testify that p, the\nfollowing conditions must also be met:\n\n\nTestimony: S testifies by making some statement that p\nif and only if:\n\n(T1)\nS\u2019s stating that p is evidence that p\nand is offered as evidence that p.\n(T2)\nS has the relevant competence, authority, or credentials to\nstate truly that p.\n(T3)\nS\u2019s statement that p is relevant to some\ndisputed or unresolved question (which may or may not be whether\np) and is directed to those who are in need of evidence on the\nmatter. (Coady 1992: 42).\n\n\n\nHowever, opponents have objected to each of T1\u2013T3. Here is just\none example. Some have rejected T1 on the grounds that one can testify\nthat p even though the testimony itself does not provide the\nhearer with any evidence that p is true, e.g., if I tell you\nthat humans spontaneously combust all the time, and insofar as you\nknow that I am wildly unreliable about this issue, it seems like I\nhave testified to you even though my testimony provides no evidence\nwhatsoever for the proposition in question. (See E. Fricker (1995) and\nLackey (2008). See Lackey (2008: Ch. 1) for a discussion of other\nproblems with this view).\n\nIn light of worries like these, many authors have offered alternative\ntakes on how testimony should be characterized. For instance, E.\nFricker (1995: 396\u20137) argues that testimony should just be\nunderstood in a very general sense, with \u201cno restrictions either\non the subject matter, or on the speaker\u2019s epistemic relation to\nit.\u201d (See also Audi (1997) and Sosa (1991) for views in this\nballpark). And, as we saw in\n Section 3.2.1,\n proponents of the Assurance View understand testimony in terms of\nTelling.\n\nGraham (1997: 227) offers a different account of testimony based on\nconveying information, i.e., a speaker, S, testifies that\np if, and only if, (i) S\u2019s stating that p\nis offered as evidence that p (ii) S intends that his\naudience believe that he has the relevant competence, authority, or\ncredentials to state truly that p and (iii) S\u2019s\nstatement that p is believed by S to be relevant to some\nquestion that he believes is disputed or unresolved (which may or may\nnot be whether p) and is directed at those whom he believes to\nbe in need of evidence on the matter. (J. Ross 1975 and Elgin (2002)\nalso offer accounts that crucially hinge on the speaker\u2019s\nstatement purporting to convey information).\n\nAnd Lackey (2008: 30\u201332) offers a disjunctive account of\ntestimony according to which we need to distinguish between\nspeaker testimony and hearer testimony as\nfollows.\n\n\nSpeaker Testimony: S s-testifies that p by\nperforming an act of communication a if and only if, in\nperforming a, S reasonably intends to convey the\ninformation that p (in part) in virtue of a\u2019s\ncommunicable content.\n\nHearer Testimony: S h-testifies that p by\nmaking an act of communication a if and only if H,\nS\u2019s hearer, reasonably takes a as conveying the\ninformation that p (in part) in virtue of a\u2019s\ncommunicable content.\n\n\nOne upshot of this disjunctive account is that it captures the sense\nin which testimony is often an intentional act performed by the\nspeaker, as well as the sense in which testimony is a source of\nknowledge and justified belief regardless of what the speaker intended\nto say.\n\nRegardless of how testimony itself should be understood, all of these\nauthors agree that it is possible to learn from the testimony of\nothers. As we have seen, though, explaining how it is that we can\nlearn from what other people tell us has proven to be a difficult\ntask.\n",
