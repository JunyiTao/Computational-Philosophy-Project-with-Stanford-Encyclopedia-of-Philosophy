    "main_text": "The Later Wittgenstein || Transition and Critique of Tractatus\n3.1 Transition and Critique of Tractatus\n\nThe idea that philosophy is not a doctrine, and hence should not be\napproached dogmatically, is one of the most important insights of the\nTractatus. Yet, as early as 1931, Wittgenstein referred to\nhis own early work as \u2018dogmatic\u2019 (\u201cOn\nDogmatism\u201d in VC, p. 182). Wittgenstein used this term\nto designate any conception which allows for a gap between question\nand answer, such that the answer to the question could be found at a\nlater date. The complex edifice of the Tractatus is built on\nthe assumption that the task of logical analysis was to discover the\nelementary propositions, whose form was not yet known. What marks the\ntransition from early to later Wittgenstein can be summed up as the\ntotal rejection of dogmatism, i.e., as the working out of\nall the consequences of this rejection. The move from the\nrealm of logic to that of the grammar of ordinary language as the\ncenter of the philosopher\u2019s attention; from an emphasis on\ndefinition and analysis to \u2018family resemblance\u2019 and\n\u2018language-games\u2019; and from systematic philosophical\nwriting to an aphoristic style\u2014all have to do with this\ntransition towards anti-dogmatism in its extreme. It is in the\nPhilosophical Investigations that the working out of the\ntransitions comes to culmination. Other writings of the same period,\nthough, manifest the same anti-dogmatic stance, as it is applied,\ne.g., to the philosophy of mathematics or to philosophical\npsychology.\n",
