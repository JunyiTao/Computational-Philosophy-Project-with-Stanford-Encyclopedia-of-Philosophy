    "main_text": "\n\nThomas of Erfurt was the most influential member of a group of later\nmedieval philosophers known as the speculative grammarians or\nModistae (Modists), after the central place they assigned to\nthe modi significandi (modes of signifying) of a word in\ntheir analyses of human discourse. The notion that a word, once it has\nbeen imposed to signify, carries with it all of its syntactical modes,\nor possible combinations with other words, had been around since the\ntwelfth century. What the Modistae did was to posit the\norigins of the modi significandi in terms of parallel\ntheories of modi intelligendi (modes of understanding) and\nmodi essendi (modes of being). The result was a curious\namalgam of philosophy, grammar, and linguistics. Thomas of Erfurt\u2019s\nDe modis significandi became the standard Modist textbook in\nthe fourteenth century, though it has since enjoyed even greater fame\nlater thanks to its misidentification as a work of Duns Scotus. The\ntext appeared in early printed editions of Scotus\u2019s Opera\nOmnia, where it was read and commented upon by later figures such\nas Charles S. Peirce and Martin Heidegger, whose 1916 doctoral thesis,\nDie Kategorien- und Bedeutungslehre des Duns Scotus, should\nhave been titled, Die Kategorienlehre des Duns Scotus und die\nBedeutungslehre des Thomas von Erfurt.\n",
