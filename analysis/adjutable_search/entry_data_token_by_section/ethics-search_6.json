    "main_text": "Ethical Implications and Core Ethical Issues || Search Engine Bias and the Problem of Opacity/Nontransparency\n3.1 Search Engine Bias and the Problem of Opacity/Nontransparency\n\n\nWhat is search-engine bias, and why is it controversial? In\nreviewing the literature on this topic, it would seem that the phrase\n\u201csearch-engine bias\u201d has been used to describe at least\nthree distinct, albeit sometimes overlapping, concerns: (1)\nsearch-engine technology is not neutral, but instead has embedded\nfeatures in its design that favor some values over others; (2) major\nsearch engines systematically favor some sites (and some kinds of sites)\nover others in the lists of results they return in response to user\nsearch queries; and (3) search algorithms do not use objective criteria\nin generating their lists of results for search queries.\n3.1.1 The Non-Neutrality of Search Engines\n\n\nWhile some users may assume that search engines are\n\u201cneutral\u201d or value-free, critics argue that search engine\ntechnology, as well as computer technology in general, is value-laden\nand thus biased because of the kinds of features typically included in\ntheir design. For example, Brey (1998, 2004) and others (see, for\ninstance, Friedman and Nissenbaum 1996) have argued\nthat computer technology has certain built-in features that tend to\nfavor some values over others. Brey worries that some of these\ntechnological features have embedded values that are \u201cmorally\nopaque.\u201d Because the values embedded in these features are not\nalways apparent to the technical experts who develop computer systems,\nBrey believes that a methodological framework, which expands upon what\nhe calls the \u201cstandard\u201d applied-ethics model typically used\nin \u201cmainstream computer ethics,\u201d is needed to identify or\ndisclose the \u201chidden\u201d values at the design stage. He refers\nto this model as \u201cdisclosive computer ethics\u201d (Brey 2004, 55\u201356).\n\n\nIdentifying the human values embedded in technological design and\ndevelopment has been the main objective of a movement called Value\nSensitive Design or VSD, which Friedman, Kahn and Borning\n(2008, 70) define as a\n\ntheoretically grounded approach to the\ndesign of technology that accounts for human values in a principled and\ncomprehensive manner throughout the design process.\n\n Friedman et al. illustrate their model using the example of\nInternet cookies\u2014i.e., small text files that a Web browser\nplaces on a user\u2019s computer system for the purposes of tracking and\nrecording that user\u2019s activities on a Web site. In particular, they\nexamine the design of cookies in connection with the informed-consent\nprocess vis-\u00e0-vis Web browsers. They further argue that embedded\nfeatures in the design of cookies challenge the value of informed\nconsent and that this value is important because it protects other\nvalues such as privacy, autonomy, and trust.\n\n\nCookies technology is not only embedded in the design of contemporary\nWeb browsers, it is also used by major search engine companies to\nacquire information about users. In so far as these companies place\ncookies on users\u2019 computer systems, without first getting their\nconsent, they also seem to contribute to, and perhaps even exacerbate,\nat least one kind of technology-related bias\u2014i.e., one that\nthreatens values such as privacy and autonomy, while favoring values\nassociated with surveillance and monitoring. However, since this kind\nof bias also applies to design issues affecting Web browsers, it is\nnot peculiar to search engines per se.\n3.1.2 The Manipulation of Search Results\n\n\nSome critics, including Introna and Nissenbaum (2000), tend to view\nthe schemes used to manipulate search results as the paradigm case of\nbias in the context of search engines.  In their highly influential\npaper on this topic, Introna and Nissenbaum argued that search\nengines\n\nsystematically exclude certain sites\nand certain types of sites, in favor of others, systematically giving\nprominence to some at the expense of others.\n\n There has been\nconsiderable speculation as to why this is the case, but we briefly\nexamine two reasons that have been prominent in discussions in the\nliterature: (a) the interests of advertisers who sponsor search\nengines; and (b) schemes used by technically-savvy individuals and\norganizations to manipulate the ordered ranking of sites returned by\nsearch engines. (A third reason that is also sometimes suggested has to\ndo with the nature of the algorithms used by major search engine\ncompanies; that issue is examined in this Section 3.1.3).\n3.1.2.1 Online Advertising Strategies and Search Bias\n\n\nSome critics, including Hinman (2005) and Noble (2018), point\nout that search engine companies are \u201canswerable\u201d to the\npaid advertisers who sponsor them. So, for many of these critics,\nbias-related concerns affecting the inclusion/exclusion of certain\nsites can be attributable mainly to the interests of paid advertisers.\nGoogle founders Brin and Page (1998, 18), who initially opposed\nthe idea of paid advertisement on search engines, noted that it would\nseem reasonable to \n\nexpect that advertising funded search engines\nwill be inherently biased towards the advertisers and away from the\nneeds of consumers\u2026 Since it is very difficult even for experts\nto evaluate search engines, search engine bias is particularly\ninsidious\u2026[and] less blatant bias are likely to be tolerated by\nthe market.\n\n\n\nIt is worth noting that advertising schemes used by search engines\nhave evolved over time. For example, Diaz (2008, 21) points out that\nbanner ads, which were common on the Internet during the Web 1.0 era,\nhave been replaced by \u201cpaid placement of ads.\u201d He also\nnotes that \u201cpaid listings\u201d (unlike the earlier banner ads)\ndo not always look very different from the normal results returned to\nusers. Elgesem (2008) points out that search engines such as GoTo,\nwhose lists of search results were based entirely on \u201cpaid\nhits\u201d from advertisers, allegedly failed because of user\ndissatisfaction with the results they received. Eventually, however,\nGoTo was taken over by Google, which continued to use GoTo\u2019s\nmethod for generating paid-ad-based search results but physically\nseparated those results from the \u201corganic\u201d results that\nappear on the center of its pages (Elgesem 2008); this scheme, which\ncontrasts the two different kinds of results, seems to have been\naccepted by Google users.\n\n\nDiaz describes two other kinds of bias-related concerns that affect\nadvertising schemes used by search engine companies: (i) the arbitrary\n(and seemingly inconsistent) criteria used by these companies in\naccepting advertisements, and (ii) the imprecise (and sometimes\nconfusing) criteria used to separate editorials (approved by a search\nengine company) from their paid advertisements. (Although the kind of\ndiscrimination with regard to the ads that Google accepts or rejects\nmay seem arbitrary in an innocuous sense, Diaz notes that Google has\nalso refused to accept ads from some organizations that have been\ncritical of corporations that were already sponsors for Google.)\nRegarding (ii), Diaz explains how bias-related concerns affecting paid\nadvertisements can sometimes be confused with editorials that are also\ndisplayed by search engine companies on their Web pages. Whereas\neditorials and ads may look very different in newspapers, Diaz notes\nthat this is not always the case in search engines. (We also examine\nsome aspects of search engine bias in the context of online\nadvertisements in our analysis of moral-accountability issues for\nsearch engine companies in Section 4.\n\n\nSome critics assume that as conflicts affecting online\nadvertisements in the context of search engines are eventually resolved, the amount of\nbias in search engine results will also decline or perhaps disappear\naltogether. However, other schemes can also be used to influence the\nprivileging of some sites over others, in terms of both their inclusion\n(vs. exclusion) and their ranking.\n3.1.2.2 Technological Schemes Used to Manipulate Search Results\n\nWe have already noted that some technically-savvy\nindividuals and organizations have figured out various strategies for\n\u201cgaming the system\u201d\u2014i.e., positioning their sites\nhigher in the schemes used by search engine companies to generate\nresults (see, for example, Goodwin 2018). These schemes are commonly referred to by\n\u201cinsiders\u201d as instances of SEO, or Search Engine\nOptimization, and we briefly consider what can now be regarded as a\nclassic SEO ploy. Some organizations and individuals had effectively\nused HTML meta tags and keywords (embedded in HTML source code) to\ninfluence search engine companies to give their sites higher rankings\nin the ordering schemes for their respective categories of search.\nEventually, however, search engine companies recognized the\nmanipulative aspects of these HTML features and began to disregard them\nin their ranking algorithms (Goldman 2008).\n\n\nMany organizations now use a different kind of strategy to achieve a\nhigher ranking for their sites\u2014one that takes advantage of the\n(general) formulas currently used by major search engine companies.\nBlanke (2005, 34) notes that in Google\u2019s algorithm, Web pages\n\u201cachieve a better ranking if they optimize their relationship\nwithin the system of hubs and authorities.\u201d Whereas\n\u201cauthorities\u201d are Web pages that are \u201clinked by many\nothers,\u201d hubs \u201clink themselves to many pages.\u201d Diaz\n(2008) points out that highly referenced hubs will have the highest Page\nRanks. So Web site owners and designers who know how to exploit these\nfactors (as well as how to use various SEO-related schemes) to\nmanipulate ranking in search engine results will have the highest\nranked sites. Diaz also notes that these sites \u201ctend to belong to\nlarge, well-known technology companies such as Amazon and eBay,\u201d\nwhile \u201cmillions of typical pages\u2026will have the lowest\nranking.\u201d Thus, it would seem that the kind of search engine bias\nidentified by Introna and Nissenbaum that, whereby certain Web sites\nare systematically included/excluded in favor of others, will not\nnecessarily be eliminated simply by resolving conflicts related to paid\nadvertising in the context of search engine companies. In all\nlikelihood, organizations will continue to figure out ways to use\nSEO-related techniques to achieve a higher ranking for their sites and\nthus gain better exposure on search engines, especially on Google. As\nHinman (2005) puts it, \u201cEsse est indicato in Google (to be is to be\nindexed on Google).\u201d\n3.1.3 The Problem of Objectivity\n\n\nConcerns affecting search engine bias vis-\u00e0-vis questions\nhaving to do with \u201cobjectivity\u201d have two distinct aspects:\n(A) objectivity regarding criteria used in search algorithms; and (B)\nobjectivity with respect to the results returned by a particular search\nengine in its responses to multiple users entering the same search\nquery. With regard to (A), we saw that the traditional criteria used by Web search engine\ncompanies to rank sites was based on two factors: the number of visits\nto a page, and the number of other pages that link to a given page;\nHinman (2005) believes that this technique would seem to give the user\n\u201csome semblance of objective criteria.\u201d He points out, for\nexample, that even if search engines were to \u201cget it wrong\u201d\nin returning the best results for a particular search query, there was\nan \u201cobjective fact of the matter to be gotten wrong.\u201d And\neven though the early search engines ranked their sites in terms of\n\u201cpopularity,\u201d there was, as Hinman (2005, 22) puts it, a\n\u201ctechnical and objective meaning\u201d of popularity. But we\nalso saw that this formula has changed dramatically in the case of Web\n2.0-era search engines, where increasingly \u201cpersonalized\nalgorithms\u201d tend to tailor search results to fit the profile of\nthe user entering the query.\n\n\nThis trend toward the \u201cpersonalizing\u201d of algorithms feeds\ndirectly into concerns affecting (B). Even though many sophisticated\nusers might suspect that the lists of returns for their search queries\nare biased, for any number of possible reasons\u2014e.g., paid\nadvertising, unfair influence by large corporations, editorial\ncontrol, and so forth\u2014many search engine users still tend to\nassume, perhaps na\u00efvely, that when any two users enter the exact\nsame search query in a major search engine such as Google, they would\nreceive identical lists of responses. In other words, even if the\nformula used is skewed, or biased in a way that favors some sites over\nothers, the search algorithm would nonetheless return results based on\na formula that is internally consistent, and thus standard or\n\u201cobjective\u201d in some sense. But, this is no longer the case\nin an era where formulas based on \u201cpersonalization\u201d\ngenerate search results tailored to a user\u2019s profile. For example, if\nI enter the term \u201ceagles\u201d in a search box, the list and\nthe order of returns that I receive will likely depend on the profile\nthat the search engine company has constructed about me. If the\ncompany determines that I am interested in biology, for instance, I\nmay be directed to a site sponsored by the Audubon Society. But, if\ninstead, it determines that I am a sports enthusiast living in the\nPhiladelphia area, I may be directed first to the Philadelphia Eagles\nWeb site. On the\ncontrary, if my profile suggests that I like rock/pop music, I may be\ndirected first to the site for the Eagles music group. So there would\nnot appear to be any overall \u201cobjective\u201d formula used by\nthe search engine in question.\n\n\nSome question whether a lack of objectivity with respect to the\nresults returned to users in response to their search queries is\nnecessarily a problem. For example, Blanke (2005, 34) believes that\nwe should \u201cneither demand nor expect to receive information from\nsearch engines that is objective\u201d (i.e., information that is\neither \u201cneutral or complete\u201d). So, he argues that any\ncritique of search engines as being biased \u201cmisses its\ntarget,\u201d because one should not expect search engines to deliver\nonly neutral and objective results. His rationale for this claim,\nhowever, seems to be based on the view that search engine technology\n\u201cwas not designed to do this.\u201d But this analysis seems to\nbeg the question, unless, of course, Blanke means that search engine\ntechnology could not, in principle, be designed to deliver neutral and\nobjective results.\n\n\nQuestions concerning objectivity in the context of search engines\nare also examined by Goldman (2008), who seems to defend\u2014and,\nat times, perhaps even applaud\u2014search engine bias in that\nrespect. First, he notes that search engine companies \u201cmake\neditorial judgments about what data to collect and how to present that\ndata\u201d (2008, 122). However, he also believes that search\nengine bias is \u201cnecessary and desirable\u201d\u2014i.e., it\nis \u201cthe unavoidable consequence of search engines exercising\neditorial control over their databases\u201d (p. 127). So he is\nwilling to concede that \u201csearch engine companies, like all other\nmedia companies, skew results.\u201d But while many assume that search\nengine bias is undesirable, Goldman sees it as a \u201cbeneficial\nconsequence of search engines optimizing content for their\nusers.\u201d He also believes that \u201cthe \u2018winner takes\nall\u2019 effect caused by top placement in search results will be\nmooted by emerging personalized search technology\u201d (p. 121). He\nfurther argues that \u201cpersonalized ranking algorithms\u201d will\n\u201creduce the effect of search engine bias because there will\nlikely be multiple \u2018top\u2019 search results of a particular\nsearch term instead of a single winner [and] personalized algorithms\nwill eliminate many of the current concerns about search engine\nbias\u201d (p. 130). Thus Goldman seems to suggest, paradoxically\nperhaps, that any problems affecting objectivity will be solved by\nincreased subjectivity in the form of personalization of\nresults achieved by personalized search algorithms. However, this\ndirection in search engine evolution can have serious negative effects\nfor democracy and democratic ideals (discussed further in\n Section 3.4).\n\n\nConcerns affecting objectivity and bias in the context of search\nengines are also closely related to controversies pertaining to the\nlack of \u201copenness\u201d or \u201ctransparency\u201d (see,\nfor example, Noble 2018). Some critics point out that search engine\ncompanies are not fully open, or transparent, both with respect\nto why they (a) include some sites and not others (in their\nlists of results for users\u2019 queries), and (b) rank some pages in\ntheir list of search results higher than others. These kinds of\nopacity/non-transparency-related concerns tend to fall under a\ndescription that Hinman (2005) calls \u201cthe problem of\nalgorithm.\u201d Hinman notes that the algorithms that govern\nsearches are well-kept secrets, which he also believes is\nappropriate. Because Google\u2019s PageRank algorithm is \u201ca\npatented and closely guarded piece of intellectual property\u201d\n(Halpern 2011, 4), we don\u2019t know the algorithm\u2019s\nformulas. And this factor, of course, makes it difficult to comment on\nan algorithm\u2019s objectivity or lack thereof.\n\n\nAnother set of worries affecting opacity/non-transparency arise\nbecause search engine companies do not always disclose, either fully or\nclearly, their practices with respect to two important points: (i)\nwhether (and to what extent) they collect information about users; and\n(ii) what they do with that information once it has been collected.\nThese kinds of opacity/non-transparency concerns involving search\nengine companies, which are also related to privacy issues affecting\nmonitoring and surveillance, are examined in detail in\n Section 3.3.\n",
