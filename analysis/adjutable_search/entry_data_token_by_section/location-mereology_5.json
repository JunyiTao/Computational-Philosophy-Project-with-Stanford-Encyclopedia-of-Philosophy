    "main_text": "Interpenetration || For Interpenetration #1: from Universals or Tropes\n4.1 For Interpenetration #1: from Universals or Tropes\n\nImmanent realists say that a universal is in some sense \u2018wholly\npresent\u2019 in each thing that instantiates it (Armstrong 1978: 79;\nBigelow 1988; O\u2019Leary-Hawthorne 1995; Smith 1997;\nO\u2019Leary-Hawthorne and Cover 1998; Paul 2002, 2006, 2012; Newman\n2002; Hawley and Bird 2011; Lafrance 2015; Peacock 2016). This makes\nit natural to hold that disjoint universals frequently\ninterpenetrate.\n\nTo see why, let e be an electron, and suppose that it\ninstantiates two different universals: a mass universal,\num, and a charge universal,\nuc. Suppose that e is exactly located\nat region r. Then it will be natural for the immanent realist\nto say that (i) um is exactly located at\nr as well, or at least at some region\nrm that has r as a part, and (ii)\nuc is exactly located at r or at some\nregion rc that has r as a part. (If\nthese universals are also instantiated elsewhere, then it will be\ndebatable as to whether they are exactly located at r.\nPerhaps um has only one exact location, which\nfuses the exact locations of its instances (Effingham 2015). Likewise\nfor uc.) Either way, the immanent realist\nwill say that um and\nuc have exact locations that overlap. But\npresumably um and uc\ndo not overlap. Assuming that these universals are non-structural,\nnon-conjunctive, and perfectly natural, they are plausibly\nsimple, in which case they overlap only if they are\nidentical, which they are not. It would seem that a similar point can\nbe made in terms of\n tropes\u2014particular,\n spatiotemporally located \u2018cases\u2019 of properties or\nrelations. For trope theorists who take tropes to be located at\nspacetime regions, it will be natural to say that mass tropes and\ncharges tropes, for example, frequently interpenetrate. (Since\nelectrons have charge and mass, trope theorists will find it natural\nsay that if an electron is exactly located at a region r, then\nthe electron's mass trope and the electron's charge trope are both\nexactly located at r as well, hence that those tropes'\nlocations overlap (by being identical). But presumably the tropes\nthemselves are not identical and do not overlap. Three responses to\nthis argument are worth considering.\n\nThe first response says: so much the worse for tropes and immanent\nuniversals. This response uses a mereo-locational principle, No\nInterpenetration, as a premise in an argument against certain\nmetaphysical views, namely those that posit tropes or immanent\nuniversals. Is there some reason why mereo-locational principles\nshould not be used in this way? The principles of pure mereology are\noften so used. For example, Lewis (1999: 108\u2013110) rejects states\nof affairs and structural universals on the grounds that they would\nviolate the Uniqueness of Composition, the principle that no entities\nxx have more than one\n fusion.[5]\n Why not give the same status to certain mereo-locational principles?\nWhy not, for example, say that No Interpenetration is better justified\nthan is the view that universals or tropes are spatiotemporally\nlocated? True, it is hard to say much by way of argument for No\nInterpenetration. But the same can be said of various purely\nmereological principles, such as the Transitivity of Parthood, and\nthis is often treated as a non-negotiable constraint that any\nmetaphysical position must obey.\n\nThe second response says that while immanent universals or tropes are\nspatiotemporal entities that are \u2018in their instances\u2019,\nthey are not exactly located anywhere. Armstrong writes that\n\n\nTalk of the location of universals, while better than placing them in\nanother realm, is also not quite appropriate\u2026 To talk of\nlocating universals in space-time then emerges as a crude way of\nspeaking. Space-time is not a box into which universals are put.\nUniversals are constituents of states of affairs. Space-time is a\nconjunction of states of affairs. In that sense, universals are\n\u201cin\u201d spacetime. But they are in it as helping to\nconstitute it. (1989: 99)\n\n\nSimplified somewhat, the response holds that (i) universals are parts\nor constituents of entities that have exact locations, and in that\nsense they are \u2018in their instances\u2019, but (ii) universals\ndo no themselves have exact locations and hence do not have\noverlapping exact locations. Given (ii), the universals or tropes in\nquestion no longer count as examples of interpenetration. Call this\nthe Burying Strategy, since it \u2018buries\u2019\nuniversals and/or tropes in located entities, rather than treating\nthem as being located.\n\nHere is an especially vivid instance of the Burying Strategy: All\ntropes are instantaneous, spatially point-sized, and\nmereologically simple. All spacetime points are\ninstantaneous, spatially point-sized, and mereologically complex. In\nparticular, each spacetime point is a fusion of some tropes (each of\nwhich is at zero distance from each of the rest), and each trope is a\npart of exactly one spacetime point. Something counts as a\nspacetime region if and only if it is either a\nspacetime point or a fusion of some spacetime points. Each spacetime\nregion is exactly located at itself and nothing else has an exact\nlocation.\n\nOn this view, tropes are parts of spacetime points and regions but\nthey do not have exact locations. Hence, even if two tropes are both\nparts of the same spacetime point, they do not interpenetrate, in our\nsense.\n\nThe third response to the argument from universals and tropes is to\nsay, \u2018True, universals and/or tropes can interpenetrate, but\nmaterial objects can't\u2019. This grants the argument and rejects No\nInterpenetration in favor of a weaker, restricted principle. If we\nintroduce a one-place predicate, \u2018M\u2019, for \u2018is\na material object\u2019, then we can state the restricted principle\nas\n\n(2)\n\u25a1\u2200x\u2200y\u2200z\u2200w[(M(x)\n& M(y) & L(x, z) &\nL(y, w) & O(z, w))\n\u2192  O(x, y)]\n\nNecessarily, if material objects x and y have exact\nlocations that overlap, then x and y themselves\noverlap.\n\n\nThis response also handles potential counterexamples to No\nInterpenetration arising from regions, sets, events, portions of\nstuff, holes, spirits, and other \u2018immaterial\nentities\u2019.\n\n(On the location of regions, see Casati and Varzi (1999: 123), who\nhold that regions are located at themselves, and Simons (2004b: 345),\nwho holds that nothing is located at itself. On the location of sets,\nsee Maddy (1990), Lewis (1991), Effingham (2010b; 2012), and Cook\n(2012). On the location of events, see Casati and Varzi (1999), Price\n(2007), Giordani and Costa (2013, 2016) and Costa (2017). On the\nlocation of portions of stuff, see Markosian (1998), (2004a), and\n(2015). On the location of holes and shadows, see Lewis and Lewis\n(1970), Casati and Varzi (1994), Wake, Spencer, and Fowler (2007),\nDonnelly, Bittner, and Rosse (2006), and Sorensen (2008). On the\nlocation of spirits, see Thomas (2009) and Inman (2017). Sanford\n(1970) discusses many of these topics, and Hudson (2005: 4) mentions\nmany of them briefly.)\n\nThe next two pro-interpenetration arguments count equally against No\nInterpenetration and (2), but we will continue to focus on No\nInterpenetration for simplicity.\n",
