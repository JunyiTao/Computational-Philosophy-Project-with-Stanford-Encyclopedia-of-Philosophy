    "main_text": "Human\u2013Divine Atonement\n3. Human\u2013Divine Atonement\n\nAtonement is deeply important for religions such as Judaism and,\nespecially, Christianity. (See Cornille 2021 for a comparison of these\nwith other religious approaches to atonement.) In this and the\nfollowing sections we will focus on the Christian notion of God and\nwhat atonement might look like in a Christian context.\n\nJust as humans can wrong each other, so can they wrong\n God.[24]\n Atoning to God can differ from atoning to a fellow human because the\nvictim, the nature of the wrongdoing, and the kind of relationship\nthat one aims to or should aim to reconcile all differ. First,\nGod\u2019s nature may affect the seriousness of wrongs against him.\nAnselm and many others in the medieval Christian theological\ntradition, for instance, hold that sinning against God is infinitely\nworse than wronging a fellow human being because God is perfectly,\ninfinitely good whereas fellow humans are not (CDH II.14; see\nalso Aquinas ST I-II.87.3\u20134).\n\nSecond, how God is wronged differs in some ways from how humans are\nwronged. Wronging God disrespects and insults him and wronging someone\nis always \u201cin itself objectively harmful\u201d (Cross 2001:\n401). However, God is harmed by sin differently than humans are harmed\nby wrongdoing. God\u2019s safety or existence is never threatened.\nGod cannot be physically or emotionally injured in his divine\n nature.[25]\n But God can be harmed in other ways: his desire that humans love and\nobey him can be frustrated, his plans for humanity can be frustrated\n(Anselm CDH I.23), and he is indirectly harmed by the harm\ndone to other things he loves (Hick 1993 [2005:\n 123]).[26]\n The latter harm implies that atoning to God will require atoning to\nthe human victims of one\u2019s wrongdoing (Thurow\n 2017a).[27]\n\nThird, the shape of atonement to God for human sin depends on the kind\nof reconciled relationship humans want or should want to have with\nGod, or that God wants to have with them\u2014especially important\nif, as Christians believe, God plays a crucial role in helping humans\natone (Thurow\n 2021b).[28]\n This relationship has been depicted many different ways: as a certain\nsort of union of love (John 17:20ff; Stump 2018), a familial\nrelationship\u2014being brothers and sisters of Christ, with God as\nfather (Hebrews 2:10ff), friendship with God (John 15:12ff; Aquinas\nST II-II.23.1), fellowship with God (1Cor. 1:9; Taylor 1941),\ncovenantal love (Deut. 7:9\u201310; Levenson 2016), all followers of\nGod being unified in one body, with Christ as the head (Ephesians\n4:1ff; De Lubac 1947 [1988]), and deification/theosis/renewing the\nimage of God in humanity (2Cor. 3:18; Athanasius On the\nIncarnation). These are each more robust relationships than\nmerely moral reconciliation.\n\nUnsurprisingly, there are several different accounts of how humans can\nand should atone to God for human sin. In the next two sections we\nwill survey several different theories of the Christian doctrine of\natonement. Each theory tends to emphasize one or more of the ways of\natonement described in\n section 2\n in their accounts of how Christ atones for human sin. Thus the\ntheories implicitly grant that atoning to God resembles to some degree\natoning to humans\u2014although the nature of God, the severity of\nhuman sin, the weakness of humans, and other contextual factors are\ntaken to imply that atoning to God will in practice and detail look\ndifferent than atoning to humans (Thurow 2021a).\n\nFor a summary of work on the issue of how the Christian doctrine of\natonement might help make sense of moral phenomena, see the appendix,\nAtonement, God, and Morality (LINK).\n",
