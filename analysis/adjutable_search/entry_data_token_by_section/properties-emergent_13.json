When two (or more) quantum particles or systems\ninteract in certain ways and are then (even space-like) separated,\ntheir measurable features (e.g., position and momentum) will correlate\nin ways that cannot be accounted for in terms of \u201cpure\u201d\nquantum states of each particle or system separately. In other words,\nthe two need to be thought of as a coupled system, having certain\nfeatures which are in no sense a compositional or other resultant of\nindividual states of the system\u2019s components (see Silberstein\n& McGeever 1999 and entries on\n holism and nonseparability in physics\n and\n quantum entanglement and information).\n Humphreys (2016) construes this as an instance of emergent fusion\n (section 4.2.4).\n Insofar as these features have physical effects, they indicate a\nnear-ubiquitous failure of whole-part property supervenience at a very\nsmall scale. However, it should be observed that quantum entanglement\ndoes not manifest a fundamental novelty in feature or associated\ncausal power, as it concerns only the value or magnitude of a\nfeature/associated power had by its components. (Correlated\n\u201cspin\u201d values, e.g., are permutations on the fundamental\nfeature of spin, rather than being akin to mass or charge as wholly\ndistinctive features.) As such, it does not fit the criteria of many\naccounts of strongly emergence. It is, however, relevant to the\nepistemic status of such accounts: if one thinks that the existence of\nstrong emergence is implausible on grounds that a kind of strong local\nsupervenience is a priori very plausible for composed systems\ngenerally, then the surprising phenomenon of quantum entanglement\nshould lead you to be more circumspect in your assumptions regarding\nhow complex systems are put together.\n5.2.2 Quantum Chemistry\n\nThe interface of physics with chemistry has long been thought to\nsupport ontological reductionism (or physicalism, more generally).\nThis sentiment goes back to an early declaration by Paul Dirac, one of\nthe founding figures of quantum mechanics:\n\n\nThe underlying laws necessary for the mathematical theory of a larger\npart of physics and the whole of chemistry are thus completely known,\nand the difficulty is only that exact applications of these laws lead\nto equations much too complicated to be soluble. (1929: 714)\n\n\nIn recent decades, there has recently been reconsideration of this\nperspective. Hendry (1998, 2010, 2017, 2019), following Woolley (1978,\n1998) and Primas (1981), contends, to the contrary, that molecular\nstructure is (or may well be) strongly emergent, in failing to be\nwholly determined by the arrangements of a molecule\u2019s quantum\nconstituents; isomers, which have distinct molecular structure yet the\nsame subatomic constituents, are a particular focus in these\ndiscussions. Scerri (2012) criticizes this line of thought, suggesting\nthat it overlooks the possibility that a molecule\u2019s\nquantum-mechanical interaction with its environment may contribute to\nfixing its overall structure. It should be noted that the details of\nScerri\u2019s counter-proposal depend on a particular\n(collapse-based) interpretation of quantum mechanics. There has been a\nsteady uptick of discussion of this issue among philosophers of\nchemistry, and it appears to be unresolved at present. This in turn\nsuggests that, contra Dirac, strong emergence even at the interface of\nphysics and chemistry remains a live possibility. (For further\ndiscussion, see Hettema (2015) and entry on\n philosophy of chemistry,\n Section 6.)\n5.2.3 Spacetime\n\nFundamental physics encompasses two successful theories, General\nRelativity (GR) and Quantum Field Theory (QFT), that are mutually\ninconsistent. In recent years, a number of Quantum Gravity theories\nhave been put forward as candidate deeper theories that can account\nfor core dynamical principles and successful predictions of both\ntheories within one consistent framework. Strikingly, in almost all\nsuch theories, spacetime is not part of the fundamental ontology, it\nbeing supplanted by a framework that lacks at least some of its\nstructure. Many theorists say that the spacetime of GR is thereby\nrendered emergent. Its dependence is reflected in how the many roles\nthat spacetime plays in GR and the spatiotemporally structured\nexperimental observations themselves (and indeed, ubiquitous\nperceptions of everyday life!) are grounded in nonspatiotemporal\nstructures in the proposed fundamental theories. Its autonomy takes\nthe form of nonfundamental spacetime\u2019s being qualitatively\ndifferent from any feature of the fundamental theory.\n\nThe issues raised by such radical proposals are complex, and it is\neven debated whether they are empirically coherent, given the role\nthat space and time play in our understanding of physical causation\nand empirical observation, and hence of empirical evidence itself. For\npresent purposes, the key point is that such theories propose\nsystematic theoretical reductions, akin to the reduction of\nthermodynamics to statistical mechanics, with a concommitant\nontological reduction of the structures of the reduced theories. In\nthis, the case appears unlike the relationship between physics and\nbiology as weak emergentists see it, in which biological entities\nappear to be special kinds of organized physical structures that\nexplain equally distinctive phenomena that are unexplained by more\nfundamental theories. For a non-technical introduction to some of the\ntheories at issue and the case for describing them as entailing\nspacetime emergence, see W\u00fcthrich (2019). For more general\nphilosophical reflection on our ordinary concepts of space and time\nand their compatibility with theories that treat them as\nnonfundamental, see Chalmers (forthcoming).\n5.3 Pluralist interpretations of the general ontology of the sciences\n\nChampions of physicalism see the marked successes of the physical and\nbiological sciences in the twentieth and twenty-first centuries as\nestablishing, at a minimum, that the characteristic processes at all\nlevels of these domains are fixed by fundamental physical states and\nprocesses. However, some draw a different conclusion from these\nadvances, seeing new bases for strongly emergentist perspectives.\n\nMany sciences treating complex systems of one or other variety have\nundergone extensive and impressive development in the last fifty\nyears. Theorists in these disciplines freely use terms such as\n\u201cemergence\u201d and \u201ctop-down causation\u201d to\ndescribe the phenomena they study. It is often unclear, however,\nwhether they are best interpreted as describing weakly or strongly\nemergent states and associated behavior. Among those who have\nreflected recently on the state of their discipline, solid state\nphysicist Laughlin (2005), systems biologists Noble (2006) and Boogerd\n(Boogerd et al. 2005, 2007), and neuroscientist Walter Freeman (1999,\n2000) and cosmologist Ellis (2016) appear to advocate\nstrongly emergentist accounts of aspects of solid state\nphysics, biological life, and the human mind, respectively. They argue\nthat the pertinent sciences encompassing these domains give equal,\ncomplementary places to \u201cbottom up\u201d and \u201ctop\ndown\u201d determinants and principles, and argue that we cannot\nunderstand the latter as themselves ultimately fixed by instances of\nthe former. The general thrust of their detailed arguments is that\nthere is no fully \u201cbottom up\u201d way to describe, let alone\nexplain, certain organized phenomena. See also Ellis, Noble, and\nO\u2019Connor (2012) for a collection of state-of-the-art overviews\nof the interaction of top-down and bottom-up principles in numerous\nscientific domains, from fundamental physics to sociology.\n\nFinally, philosopher Nancy Cartwright (1983, 1994, 1999) has defended\nover several decades a thorough-going \u201cpatchwork\u201d or\npluralistic understanding of the relation between the sciences, as an\nalternative to the sort of \u201cphysics-at-the-bottom\u201d,\nasymmetrical hierarchy common to weak emergentists and reductionists\nalike. She argues that close consideration of scientific practice\nsuggests that fundamental physical laws hold only in certain\nartificial contexts limited to small-scale systems, which systems are\nmaintained by macroscopic barriers and mechanisms serving to screen\noff \u201cdownward\u201d causal effects. She suggests that such\ncarefully contrived results can give us no reasonable confidence in a\nvision on which all of natural reality is fixed by the unfolding of\nbottom-up physical laws alone. While arguing in somewhat different\nways, Dupr\u00e9 (1993) is sympathetic to the general pluralist or\n\u201canti-fundamentalist\u201d thrust of Cartwright\u2019s\nperspective. More generally, if anything like Cartwright\u2019s view\nis correct, and the right ontological characterization of the\nunderlying pluralism is one according to which there is fundamental\nnovelty across the spectrum of natural reality, one might naturally\ntake strong emergence to be much more prevalent than even its\nproponents have usually assumed. This perspective has affinities to\nthe \u201ctransformational\u201d accounts of emergence noted in\n section 4.2.4.\n For discussion of the broad issues raised by Cartwright, see Cat\n(1998) and entry on\n the unity of science,\n Section 5.",
