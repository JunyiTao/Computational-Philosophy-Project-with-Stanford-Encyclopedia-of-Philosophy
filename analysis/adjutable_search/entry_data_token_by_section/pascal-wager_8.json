The second\nconclusion, that you should wager for God, does not obviously\nfollow. All that we have granted is that one norm\u2014the norm of\nrationality\u2014prescribes wagering for God. For all that has been\nsaid, some other norm might prescribe wagering against God.\nAnd unless we can show that the rationality norm trumps the others, we\nhave not settled what you should do, all things considered.\n\nThere are several arguments to the effect that morality\nrequires you to wager against God. Pascal himself appears to\nbe aware of one such argument. He admits that if you do not believe in\nGod, his recommended course of action \u201cwill deaden your\nacuteness\u201d (This is Trotter\u2019s translation. Pascal\u2019s\noriginal French wording is \u201cvous ab\u00eatira\u201d, whose\nliteral translation is even more startling: \u201cwill make you a\nbeast\u201d.) One way of putting the argument is that wagering for\nGod may require you to corrupt yourself, thus violating a Kantian duty\nto yourself. Clifford 1877 argues that an individual\u2019s believing\nsomething on insufficient evidence harms society by promoting\ncredulity. Penelhum 1971 contends that the putative divine plan is\nitself immoral, condemning as it does honest non-believers to loss of\neternal happiness, when such unbelief is in no way culpable; and that\nto adopt the relevant belief is to be complicit to this immoral plan.\nSee Quinn 1994 for replies to these arguments. For example, against\nPenelhum he argues that as long as God treats non-believers justly,\nthere is nothing immoral about him bestowing special favor on\nbelievers, more perhaps than they deserve. (Note, however, that Pascal\nleaves open in the Wager whether the payoff for non-believers \\(is\\)\njust; indeed, as far as his argument goes, it may be extremely\nunjust.)\n\nFinally, Voltaire protests that there is something unseemly about the\nwhole Wager: \u201cThat article seems a bit indecent and childish;\nthat notion of gambling, of losses and winnings, does not suit the\ngravity of the subject\u201d (Voltaire 1778 [1961, 123]). This does\nnot so much support wagering against God, as dismissing all talk of\n\u2018wagerings\u2019 altogether. Schlesinger (1994, 84) canvasses a\nsharpened formulation of this objection: an appeal to greedy,\nself-interested motivations is incompatible with \u201cthe quest for\npiety\u201d that is essential to religion. He replies that the\npleasure of salvation that Pascal\u2019s Wager countenances is\n\u201cof the most exalted kind\u201d, and that if seeking it counts\nas greed at all, then it is \u201cthe manifestation of a noble greed\nthat is to be acclaimed\u201d (85). Franklin (1998, 2018) regards\nVoltaire as caricaturing Pascal's Wager and missing his key point that\n\u201cyou must wager\u201d. Franklin argues that given that the\nchoice Pascal presents is unavoidable, it should be made on the basis\nof a rational calculation, and that his conclusion concerns\naction, not the truth of theism.\n",
