    "main_text": "Further Possibilities || Death as a Process, Not a Determinate Event\n4.1 Death as a Process, Not a Determinate Event\n\nEach of the approaches considered so far asserts the correctness of a\nsingle standard of death. Might different standards be appropriate for\ndifferent purposes? If so, then the debate characterized in previous\nsections has reflected, to some extent, an exercise in futility: a\nsearch that wrongly seeks a determinate event, which can be captured\nby a single standard, rather than a process.\n\nAccording to two authors who develop this line of reasoning, the\nnearly simultaneous emergence of organ transplantation and mechanical\nventilators provoked three practical questions: (1) When may doctors\ntake organs for transplantation? (2) When may doctors unilaterally\ndiscontinue treatment? (3) When is a patient dead for legal purposes\nand appropriately transferred to an undertaker? (Halevy and Brody\n1993). Rather than assuming that one standard for death will\nadequately answer these three questions\u2014a possibility rendered\ndoubtful by the interminable debate over standards\u2014we should\nanswer each question on its merits, disaggregating death\naccordingly.\n\nProviding one example of how these practical questions might be\nanswered, the authors argue that organ procurement is appropriate when\nthe whole-brain standard has been met (apparently precluding DCD),\nunilateral discontinuation of treatment is appropriate when the\nhigher-brain standard has been met, and a patient should legally count\nas dead when traditional criteria have been met (ibid). (Here we need\nnot consider the authors' specific arguments for these\ndeterminations.)\n\nBut why must each answer invoke a standard of death? An alternative\nwould be to adopt an updated traditional standard, which would supply\nlegal criteria for death, while denying that unilateral\ndiscontinuation of treatment and organ procurement must await death.\nTo be sure, harvesting vital organs from living patients would require\nan exception to the dead-donor rule, the social risks of which might\nwell be avoided if death were disaggregated along the lines suggested.\nBut the alternative possibility of separating death from particular\n\u201cdeath behaviors\u201d motivates the question of whether there\nare further grounds for disaggregating death into a process.\n\nA possible further ground is the thesis that life and death, although\nmutually exclusive states, are not exhaustive: \u201cAlthough no\norganism can fully belong to both sets [life and death], organisms can\nbe in many conditions (the very conditions that have created the\ndebates about death) during which they do not fully belong to either.\n\u2026 Death is a fuzzy set,\u201d (Brody 1999, 72). What are we to\nthink of this proposal?\n\nIt seems undeniable that the boundary between life and death is not\nperfectly \n sharp.[4] \n The specification of any\nstandard will require some arbitrary line-drawing. Operationalizing\nthe whole-brain standard requires a decision about which brain\nfunctions are too trivial to count and need not be tested for. Making\na traditional standard clinically useful requires a cut-off point of\nsome number of minutes without heartbeat or respiration for the loss\nof functioning to count as irreversible. A higher-brain approach needs\ncriteria for determining what sorts of brain damage constitute\nirreversible loss of the capacity for consciousness and which count as\nreversible. Yet, while some arbitrariness is inevitable, and\nhighlights a blurred boundary, the blurring in each instance concerns\nvery specific criteria and clinical tests for determining that a\nstandard has been met, not the standard itself. None of the blurred\nboundaries just considered is inconsistent with the claim that some\nstandard is uniquely correct. Moreover, if essentialism regarding\nhuman persons is true\u2014that is, if we human persons have an\nessence locating us in our most basic kind (e.g., animal, minded\nbeing)\u2014this would strengthen the case for a uniquely correct\nstandard by suggesting a foundation for one.\n\nBut we must consider the possibility that there is no correct\nstandard. Perhaps death is no more determinate than adulthood. Some\npeople are clearly adults and some people are clearly not adults. But,\nas any college professor knows, many people are ambiguously\nadults\u2014mature enough to count as adults in some ways but not in\nothers. Socially and legally, we treat 16-year-olds as adults for\npurposes of driving, 18-year-olds as adults for purposes of voting and\nbearing the full weight of criminal law, 21-year-olds as adult enough\nto drink alcoholic beverages, and so on. Nor is this disaggregation of\nadulthood incoherent or even particularly awkward; rather, it seems to\nfit the facts about the gradual development of maturity, acquisition\nof experience, and accumulation of birthdays. Disaggregating death,\none might argue, would be similarly faithful to facts about the\nfrequently very gradual demise of human persons.\n\nEven if this argument persuades us that death is more process-like\nthan event-like\u2014and to do this it must persuade us that it is\ndeath itself, not dying, that is process-like\u2014it does\nnot follow that we ought to draw several lines for the determination\nof death. Consider the confusion that would likely result from such\nstatements as \u201cGrandmother is partly dead, but less dead than\nGrandfather, although he's not fully dead.\u201d People are so\naccustomed to thinking of life and death as mutually exclusive,\nexhaustive sets that there would be considerable practical advantage\nin insisting on some sensible line that demarcates death in this way.\nIt is true that disaggregating adulthood poses no insuperable\npractical difficulties, but death is importantly different. For we\ngenerally assume that one goes out of existence (at least in this\nworld) at death, a rather momentous change with\u2014at least in the\nstatus quo\u2014far-reaching social and legal ramifications.\nConfusion as a result of plural lines for death may be more troubling\nand more likely, for the idea of someone's only partly existing is of\nquestionable intelligibility. On the other hand, a proponent of\ndisaggregating death might reply that (1) we could either reserve the\nlanguage of death for the traditional standard or get used to the\nlanguage of someone's being partially dead, and (2) we should\nappreciate that existence is sometimes partial as in the case\nof a half-assembled car.\n",
