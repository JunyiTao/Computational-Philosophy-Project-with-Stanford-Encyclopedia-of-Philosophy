    "main_text": "Arguments for and Objections to Animalism || Thinking Animal Argument\n3.1 Thinking Animal Argument\n\nThe standard argument for (1) is variously referred to as the\n\u201cthinking animal argument\u201d (Olson 1997, 2003), the\n\u201ctoo many minds objection\u201d (S. Shoemaker 1999), the\n\u201ctwo lives objection\u201d (S. Campbell 2006), and the\n\u201ctoo many thinkers problem\u201d (Parfit 2012: 7). It was\ndeveloped by Snowdon (1990: 91), Carter (1988), McDowell (1997: 237),\nand Ayers (1991, vol. 2: 283). It has since been sharpened and\npopularized by Olson (1997: 106\u201309, 2003: 325\u201330, 2007:\n29\u201339). Here it is:\n\n(P1)Presently sitting\nin your chair is a human animal.\n(P2)The human animal\nsitting in your chair is thinking.\n(P3)You are the\nthinking being sitting in your chair.\n(C)Therefore, the\nhuman animal sitting in your chair is you.\n\n\nWhilst none of (P1), (P2), and (P3) is incontestable, nor is any one\nof them easily contested. Save perhaps for far-reaching metaphysical\nreasons (e.g., an antecedent commitment to idealism), few would deny\nthe very existence of animals, nor the fact that a perfectly good\nspecimen of the species Homo sapiens is presently seated in\nyour chair. So (P1) is not easily rejected.\n\nMoreover, concerning (P2), since it would be odd (to say the least) to\ndeny that human animals think while accepting that porpoises and\nporcupines do, and since we can assume that the human animal in your\nchair is not atypical of its kind, whatever reasons one has for\naccepting that various nonhuman animals think apply equally to the\nhuman animal in your chair. While there are those who deny (in a\nsense) that any animal can think (e.g., Descartes, Johnston, S.\nShoemaker), their positions strain empirical credibility and/or depend\non fairly sophisticated metaphysical machinery. At first glance,\nanyway, (P2) is much easier to accept.\n\n(P3) is also difficult to resist, since its denial would seem to\nrequire positing the existence of a thinking being in your chair other\nthan yourself. For if (P1) and (P2) are true, and if it is true that\nyou exist and are thinking, then denying (P3) results in the\nimplication that you are but one of (at least) two thinkers seated in\nyour chair. Such a view faces a host of difficult questions: practical\nquestions (e.g., which of these beings owns the car parked out\nfront?), epistemic questions (how do you determine which of these\nbeings you are?), linguistic questions (to which of these beings do\ninstances of the first-person pronoun refer?), ontological questions\n(what is the relationship between you and the qualitatively identical\nbeing with which you are associated?), and so on. These challenges\nhave not passed unnoticed, and serious attempts have been made to\naddress them. But, the animalist says, the trouble can be avoided from\nthe start simply by conceding the truth of (P3).\n\nSo, while not necessarily unanswerable or insurmountable, the\nquestions and problems that await one who rejects any of (P1) through\n(P3) are not insignificant. Animalism, then, has at least this much\ngoing for it.\n",
