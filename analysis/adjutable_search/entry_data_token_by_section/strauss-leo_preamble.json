    "main_text": "\n\nLeo Strauss was a twentieth-century German Jewish \u00e9migr\u00e9\nto the United States whose intellectual corpus spans ancient, medieval\nand modern political philosophy and includes, among others, studies of\nPlato, Maimonides, Machiavelli, Hobbes, Spinoza, and Nietzsche.\nStrauss wrote mainly as a historian of philosophy and most of his\nwritings take the form of commentaries on important thinkers and their\nwritings. Yet as he put it: \u201cThere is no inquiry into the\nhistory of philosophy that is not at the same time a\nphilosophical inquiry\u201d (PL, p. 41). While much of his\nphilosophical project involved an attempt to rethink pre-modern\nphilosophy, the impetus for this reconsideration and the philosophical\nproblems that vexed Strauss most were decidedly modern. Strauss\nespecially worried about the modern philosophical grounds for\npolitical and moral normativity as well as about the philosophical,\ntheological, and political consequences of what he took to be modern\nphilosophy\u2019s overinflated claims for the self-sufficiency of\nreason.\n",
