Constructing Concepts or Knowing Universals?\n\nThe problem of universals, as we have seen, is at the epicentre of the\ndebate between Hindu philosophers and their Buddhist opponents. The\ndoctrine of exclusion (apoha) is the Buddhist attempt to\naccount for the relation between concepts and sensory content. The\ndoctrine of apoha basically claims that the term \u2018cow\u2019\ndoes not refer to the universal \u2018cowness\u2019 or\n\u2018cowhood\u2019 because there is no such general entity; rather,\nthe term refers to every individual that is not a non-cow. The\napoha theory of meaning is originally propounded by\nDigna\u0304ga and his followers is an attempt to explain the\nfunctioning of language, conceptual thought and inference without\nappeal to real universals. For these Buddhists, universals are merely\nimaginary constructs which lack causal efficacy and the awarenesses\nthat they produce are faint (asphut\u0323a\u0304bha). The\nunique particulars alone are ultimately real, but they do not have any\ncommon properties, and thus cannot be brought under any concept, nor\ncan they be expressed by words. They are inexpressible. Digna\u0304ga\nexplains that language functions through what is known as\n\u201cexclusion of the other\u201d\n(anya\u0304poha/apoha). This claim needs to be\nunpacked. Matilal explains,\n\n[A] word expresses a concept, and a concept, being a fiction, cannot\nPOSITIVELY qualify or characterize the particular \u2026 but it can\nNEGATIVELY disqualify the particular from being claimed by other\nfictions or concepts. Thus, construction and verbalization are to be\nunderstood as \u201cexclusion\u201d of all rival claims. If we\nassociate the name cow, or the cow, with a particular, it means that\nit is not what we cannot call a cow (1971, 44\u201345).\n\n\nThe idea is that the meaning of the word \u2018cow\u2019 is a\nnegation: not non-cow. If you exclude all the things that are not\ncows, you have the reference of the word \u2018cow\u2019. The\nHindus, in particular the Nya\u0304ya philosopher Uddyotakara and the\nMi\u0304ma\u0304m\u0323sa\u0304 philosopher Kuma\u0304rila raise many\nepistemological and metaphysical objections to Digna\u0304ga\u2019s\napohavada. The basic problem metaphysical problem is how to\nunderstand apoha as a non-existence. Both the Hindu schools\nregard non-existence as a real property of a thing (absence of a pot\nin a room) and therefore are not convinced that by introducing\napohas the Buddhist will be able to ultimately avoid reference\nto universals. The epistemological issues concern how it is possible\nto know apohas as they cannot be known by perception and any\nappeal to inference would be circular. These philosophers also raise\nlinguistic concerns that are important because the apoha doctrine does\ndouble duty as a Buddhist theory of meaning. First, since apoha\nis basically an absence, the meanings of all words would be\nsynonymous. Second, how is it possible to learn which apoha a\nword refers to?\n\nMore recently, two new annotated translations of primary texts, the\nfirst by Eltschinger et al. (2018) and the second by Taber and Kataoka\n(forthcoming) have become available. These translations\noffernew insights into the debates between the Hindus and Buddhists.\nIn the text Kuma\u0304rila takes up the linguistic concerns raised\nabove. He notes that if the relation between a word and a meaning is\nestablished by not observing that the word is applied to certain\nthings, and one never observes what the word is applied to, then the\nword simply would have no meaning at all (Apohava\u0304da, 75).\nKuma\u0304rila developed this concern into what is known as the mutual\npresupposition argument. The objection goes: If someone is taught the\nmeaning of the word \u2018cow\u2019 by being told, \u201cThe word\n\u2018cow\u2019 refers to what is not non-cow,\u201d then one must\nknow what a non-cow is. But how can one comprehend what a non-cow is\nif one does not already know what \u2018cow\u2019 means. The meaning\nof \u2018cow,\u2019 it seems, presupposes the meaning of\n\u2018non-cow,\u2019 while the meaning of \u2018non-cow\u2019\npresupposes the meaning of \u2018cow\u2019 (Apohava\u0304da,\n83\u201385ab, reprinted in Taber). The apoha theory, as we can see\nin the examples, is introduced using general terms like cow, white and\nso on. The theory may seem to work in the case of general terms\nbecause there are entities that are cow and others that are not cow,\nthere are entities that are white and others that are not white and so\non. But such a dichotomy does not hold in the case of every word. Sen\n(2011) offers the example of the word \u2018all\u2019\n(sarva). There is no entity called \u2018not all\u2019\n(asarva), which may be obtained by negating the meaning of the\nword \u2018all\u2019. Nor can it be suggested that the expression\n\u2018not all\u2019 is applicable to unity, duality, etc., because\nthe word \u2018all\u2019 stands for a collection, the components or\nconstituents of which may be things that are one, two, and so on in\nnumber; and once all the constituents of this collection are negated,\nthe word \u2018all\u2019 will become an empty expression (Sen, 2011,\n182). Kuma\u0304rila also argues that the Apohava\u0304da is unable to\naccount for words which designate actions, connectives like\n\u2018and\u2019, \u2018or\u2019 \u2018not\u2019 and\n\u2018but\u2019, verbal prefixes and prepositions, adjectives like\n\u2018knowable\u2019 and \u2018cognizable\u2019 and so on (Taber\nand Kataoka forthcoming).\n\nThe Buddhist philosopher Dharmak\u012brti (a follower of Dign\u0101ga)\ntakes up these concerns on behalf of the Buddhist in his\nPram\u0101\u1e47av\u0101rttikasvav\u1e5btti (PV(SV) heceforth).\nDharmak\u012brti responds to this concern but rather than addressing\nall the categories separately; he offers a general argument. He claims\nthat all meaningful discourse serves to rule things out: \u201can\nutterance is inseparably related to delimitation\u201d (PV(SV)\n122\u2013123). The point is illustrated by using examples of commands\n(PVSV61, 20\u201326). If one desires only water and does not care how it is\nbrought one says \u201cBring water\u201d, but if one desires a pot\nof water, one would have to say, \u2018Bring water in a pot\u2019.\nSimilarly, one mentions \u2018water\u2019 to rule out other\nsubstances, \u2018bringing\u2019 to rule out other actions. Taber\nand Kataoka (forthcoming) summarise it thus: \u201ca word is only\nuttered when certain things are to be excluded by uttering it, not\notherwise, and presumably this would be true of all parts of\nspeech\u201d. Dharmak\u012brti adds two other conditions. First,\nwords are uttered only when there is some doubt. Second, words are\nalmost always uttered in a sentence and their excluding function is\nspecified by the context and relation to other words in the context.\nDharmak\u012brti\u2019s also responds to the first concern raised\nabove: aren\u2019t all words synonymous on the Buddhist view? No,\nsays Dharmak\u012brti, because apohas are not real properties,\nrather they are \u201cdifferences\u201d. Apohas are contrasts\nthat distinct individuals share by differing from the same (more\nexactly, qualitatively similar) other things. They are not properties\nthat things in themselves have by virtue of belonging to a class (say\nof cows). Rather, they are absences things have in virtue of not\nhaving certain properties. So, for example, a certain individual\n\u2013say a spotted cow\u2014has one absence (that of being a not\nnon-cow) insofar as it is viewed, together with certain other\nindividuals as different from non-cows, and has another absence (that\nof being not non-spotted) insofar as it is viewed together with\ncertain other not non-spotted individuals which may include cows,\nhorses, humans. Different words that are applied to the same object\n\u2013 cow and spotted \u2013 have different meanings depending on\nthe corresponding differences or exclusions from other things.\nExplaining these stanzas in his PV(SV) Dharmaki\u0304rti\nsays,\n\nTherefore, although the nature [of a particular, which might serve as\nthe subject of an inference] is undivided, the\n\u201cdifference\u201d (vis\u0301es\u0323a) [that is,]\ndistinction that is known through any \u201cproperty\u201d\n(dharma) [that is,] name whatsoever cannot be imparted by\nanother [property or word] (because that other word would exclude\nother things). Thus, all words do not have the same meaning (25, 24\u201325\n).\n\n\nThere is an unusual view of the nature of particulars expressed in\nthis passage. Dharmaki\u0304rti, following Dign\u0101ga, holds that\nthe nature of a particular is one, unified. Sometimes he expresses\nthis misleadingly by saying that a thing is \u201cwithout\nparts\u201d or \u201cwithout aspects\u201d, when what he probably\nmeans is that the different aspects of its nature are fused into one;\nthey are inseparable, completely integrated. If one apprehends any\npart of the nature of a thing one must apprehend the thing in its\nentirety, because its nature is undivided. This is exactly what\nhappens in perception, a thing is grasped completely. It is only\ninference (and other conceptual cognitions) we ascertain apohas\nwhich are not intrinsic properties of the thing nor aspects of their\nnatures. Perception is always veridical owing to its direct link with\nreal thing, provided that all of its causes are in place. Conceptual\ncognition or inference is characteristically erroneous insofar as it\nmistakes the general features that it abstracts from and superimposes\non a particular for the thing in itself. Still, some conceptual\ncognitions are \u2018correct\u2019 in a sense. Kellner clarifies the\nsense in which they are correct is that they identify things correctly\nand can serve as a solid basis for successful action, whereas others\nare incorrect because they misidentify things and lead people astray \u2013\nidentifying a mirage as a reflection caused by sun\u2019s rays is in\nthis sense correct, whereas identifying it as a water body is false\n(2004, 2). In addition, Kellner clarifies that there is a kind of\nperceptual ascertainment, over and above sensory perception, which\nenables us to superimpose or ascribe features/properties of the\nobject. We may superimpose them correctly or incorrectly depending on\nthe environmental factors (lighting, distance, etc.) as well as the\ncognisor\u2019s mind being focussed in ascertaining certain aspects\nof perceived reality (Kellner, 2004, 42). Concepts, in this Buddhist\nsense, are well-formed rules for identifying exclusions. Even though\nthe Buddhists talks about the awareness produced by concepts as faint\nimpressions, it is not meant to be taken in the sense of Hume\u2019s\nideas which are a blurry expression of the real thing. Rather, the\npoint is that the concepts are constructed from abstracting general\nfeatures of objects and then superimposing them back on the objects.\nGeneral features or properties cannot be known in sensory perception\nas the Nya\u0304ya and the Mi\u0304ma\u0304m\u0323sa\u0304 opponets\nbelieve. Rather, as we see, general features can be correctly or\nincorrectly superimposed on the particulars in the perceptual or\ninferential ascertainments. They are correctly ascertained when they\nlead to successful action, incorrectly ascertained when they lead us\nastray.\n\nIn the secondary literaure discussing the apoha theory, Tillemans\n(2011) draws a useful distinction between the two versions of the\napoha doctrine offerd by Di\u1e45n\u0101ga and Dharmak\u012brti: the\ntop-down approach and the bottom-up approach. The former is presented\nby Di\u1e45n\u0101ga. According to the top-down version, the negation\noperator in the exclusion, the apoha somehow manages pick out\nreal particulars in the world while avoiding any commitment to\nuniversals. Apoha, in this sense functions like a sense or\nmeaning, a not-non X expressed by the word X, which enables us to pick\nout real particulars while at the same time avoiding a commitment to\nreal universals in virtue of the special features of double negation.\nThe latter is presented by Dharmak\u012brti who uses the causal\napproach to link language and the world. According to this version of\nthe doctrine, apoha provides a way to bridge the gap between\nsensory perception of particulars and expressions of belief and\njudgement in thought and language. The top-down version of the apoha\ndoctrine was subjected to various criticisms from the Hindu realists,\nespecially by Kum\u0101rila who criticised the doctrine on grounds of\ncircularity. The thought is that in order to understand the exclusion\nclass of non-cows, we have to first have an idea that some particulars\nare cows. In other words, one must be able to refer to cows before one\ncan refer to non-cows. The bottom-up approach developed by\nDharmak\u012brti was basically a response to this circularity worry.\nHis version of the apoha doctrine is developed as a strategy to bridge\nthe gap between non-conceptual perceptual content and conceptual\ncontent. Dreyfus (2011) develops Dharmak\u012brti\u2019s naturalized\naccount of concept formation by elucidating the mediating role of\nrepresentations that link reality to conceptuality. Representations,\nin this sense, stand for agreed-upon fictional commonalties and are\nprojected on to discrete individuals (Dreyfus, 2011, 216).\n\nThe top-down approach is promising but there is a concern that a\nbottom-up account might not succeed in offering a completely reductive\nstory about concepts. In response to this concern, Ganeri (2011)\ndevelops a hybrid account that combines the resources of the top-down\nand bottom-up approaches. The idea is that we work up from basic\nsentience and down from the language of reference and predication to\nmeet at the middle-ground of feature-placing in the formation of\nproto-concepts (Ganeri, 2011, 244). These proto-concepts show that\nsense experience can normatively constrain belief and judgement,\nthough it does not give us a full-blown reductive account of concepts\nin non-conceptual terms.\n\nThe doctrine of apoha and Ganeri\u2019s hybrid version may\nwell be ingenious, but it is a far cry from what would satisfy the\nHindu realist. According to Ny\u0101ya-Vai\u015be\u1e63ika,\nuniversals exist in this very world of ours. We do not need to\nconstruct concepts from sensory content, rather universals are part\nand parcel of this sensory content. Chadha (2014, 289) explains that\naccording to Ny\u0101ya, for a universal to exist all that is required\nis that it be exemplified; in a Quinean twist \u2013 to be is to be\nexemplified. There is no further requirement that it exist\nindependently as an abstract entity or in Plato\u2019s heaven;\nuniversals are given directly in perception insofar as their loci are\nperceived. Taber (2017) develops the M\u012bm\u0101\u1e43sa views\nabout how universals are cognised. In the first verse of his\n\u0100k\u1e5btiv\u0101da, the Kumarila explains what is at stake for\nthe M\u012bm\u0101\u1e43sakas in the debate about universals. Unlike\nthe Naiy\u0101yikas, the M\u012bm\u0101\u1e43sa philosophers are not\nmotivated merely by epistemological requirements, their main aim is to\ndefend the eternality of the Vedas. This requires that the language,\nand in turn the words and their meanings are eternal. Therefore, the\nmeaning of a word cannot be a particular which is perishable. It must\nbe a universal that exists eternally. But like the Naiy\u0101yikas,\nthe M\u012bm\u0101\u1e43sa philosophers believe that universals are\nnot merely inferred, but are directly perceived. Kumarila\u2019s\nargument for the perceptibilty of universals s developed in response\nto the Buddhist doctrine of apoha. To the Buddhist who says that we\ncannot perceive universals distinct from particulars, because\nperception can only cognise particulars. Kumarila replies by offering\nexample. When we perceive a man at a distance and wonder whether he is\na Brahmin or some other kind of man, we do so because we perceive the\nuniversal humanity directly. This would be possibble if at least some\nuniversals were not directly given in perception.\n\nIt is useful to think of a universal in this sense as a non-particular\nindividual (Chakrabarti, 1995). Examples abound: Dusky is what many\nparticulars are, though they may be spatiotemporally separated by many\nmiles and years; rainy is what several days of the year can be at the\nsame time in different places and at different times in the same\nplace. If we are not thinking of universals as abstract entities in\nPlatonic heaven or in the mind, but as individuals out there in the\nworld, it is easier to grasp the idea that they can be perceived. The\nNy\u0101ya equation of universals and properties might tempt one to\nthink that Ny\u0101ya conceives of universals as natural properties in\nDavid Lewis\u2019 sense of the term (Lewis, 1983), but such is not\nthe case. Ny\u0101ya universals are as robust as Armstrong\u2019s\nuniversals: they capture facts of resemblance and the causal powers of\nthings. Naiy\u0101yikas will happily endorse Armstrong\u2019s\n\u2018One over Many\u2019 argument as the main reason for including\nuniversals in their ontology (Armstrong, 1978). Udayana puts the point\nthus: \u201cCausality is regulated by universals, so is effect-hood.\nIt is a natural universal if there is no obstruction [in establishing\nit]; it is a conditional [nominal] universal when we have to establish\nit through effort [construction?]\u201d\n(Kira\u1e47\u0101v\u0101l\u012b, in Pra\u015bastap\u0101da\n1971, 23).\n\nAlthough Gautama mentions universals in the\nNy\u0101yas\u016btras as the meaning of general terms,there is\nno explanation in these original s\u016btras as to how they\nmight be known. Pra\u015bastap\u0101da was the first to argue that\nuniversals are sensorily given. He argues that universals, when they\ninhere in perceptible loci (e.g., \u2018cowness\u2019 in an\nindividual cow), are perceived by the same sense organs that also\nperceive those loci (Pad\u0101rthadharmasa\u1e43graha, 99).\nThis thesis is explicated in detail by Jayanta Bha\u1e6d\u1e6da in\nNy\u0101yama\u00f1jar\u012b where he argues against the\nBuddhist nominalists as well as the holistic monist pan-linguist\nBhart\u1e5bhari and his followers. Jayanta makes an allusion to the\nview that universals are given in indeterminate perception, a view\nlater developed in detail by Ga\u1e45ge\u015ba in\nTattvacint\u0101ma\u1e47i (the chapter on\n\u201cPerception,\u201d the section on \u201cIndeterminate\nPerception\u201d). Most of Jayanta\u2019s arguments against the\nBuddhist nominalist are discussed in detail in Chakrabarti (2006),\nhowever, he does not discuss the issue about universals being given in\nindeterminate perception. This is, as we have mentioned in the above\nsections, because Chakrabarti is sceptical about the coherence of the\nnotion of indeterminate perception. Chadha (2014) argues that\nGa\u1e45ge\u015ba makes a unique contribution to this debate in\nproposing the idea that universals or qualifiers are given as objects\nin indeterminate perception. He spells out his argument in terms of\nqualifiers rather than real universals, because the logical and\nepistemological role of a real universal is the same as that of a\nsimple nominal property. Ga\u1e45ge\u015ba is concerned with basic,\nunanalyzable properties that can be grasped as such in our awareness.\nBasic properties in this sense are simple; they can be grasped without\nfurther qualification. They are, according to Ny\u0101ya, the\n\u2018epistemic firsts\u2019 comparable to non-conceptual perception\nin Buddhist epistemology. Ga\u1e45ge\u015ba\u2019s argument is\npresented by Bhattacharya (1993, 10\u201311) using a specific form of\ninference (par\u0101rth\u0101num\u0101na) developed in\nNy\u0101ya for convincing others. It has a five-proposition\nstructure:\n\nProposition: The determinate perception of the form \u2018a\ncow\u2019 (or \u2018that\u2019s a cow\u2019) is produced by the\ncognition of the qualifier.\nReason: Because this is a qualificative cognition.\nPervasion with an example: Every qualificative cognition is\nproduced by a prior cognition of the qualifier, for example,\ninference.\nApplication: The perception of the form \u2018a cow\u2019 is a\nqualificative cognition.\nConclusion: Hence, it is produced by the cognition of the\nqualifier.\n\n\nThe weight of the argument rests on the third sentence.\nGa\u1e45ge\u015ba supports it offering various examples of\nqualificative cognition, namely inference, recognition, analogy,\nverbal testimony, and so on. The point is that unless some awareness\nof dung is present in a person, (s)he cannot infer that there is dung\non the hill on the basis of seeing some animals grazing on the hill.\nUniversals like fireness and dungness are given directly in\nindeterminate perception. Ga\u1e45ge\u015ba\u2019s argument\nmaintains a causal uniformity among pram\u0101na-generated cognitions\nof an entity as qualified (Phillips and Tatacharya 2004, p. 398).\nHowever, there is a problem: if anything that is known through a\nqualifier requires a prior cognition of the qualifier, there will be a\nregress of cognitions. Ga\u1e45ge\u015ba\u2019s answer is that an\nindeterminate perception blocks the threat of such a regress, because\nthe qualifier is then grasped directly rather than through another\nqualifier. In other words, the object is perceived through the\nproperty, but the property itself is perceived directly rather than\nthrough another property. The indeterminate perception, which precedes\nthe determinate perception of an object through a mode, that is, as\npossessing a certain property, is not itself a perception through a\nmode. Simply put, we need to grasp the universal cowness in order to\nhave an awareness of a particular as qualified by cowness. Chadha\n(2014) argues that Ga\u1e45ge\u015ba\u2019s argument thus shows that\nthe postulate of indeterminate perception of universals is a necessary\nrequirement for realism.\n",
