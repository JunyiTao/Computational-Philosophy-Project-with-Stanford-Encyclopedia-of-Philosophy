    "main_text": "Recent developments || Metaphor and the Context Wars\n5.3 Metaphor and Make-Believe\n\nIn 1962 the Australian philosopher Colin Murray Turbayne brought out a\nlittle book on Berkeley\u2019s theory of vision called The Myth\nof Metaphor. It had as much say about metaphor in general as\nabout Berkeley in particular.\n\nDescartes and Newton understood physical objects as complex\nmechanisms, clockworks, artifacts of a divine clockmaker, operating on\neach other and on human perceivers to welcome or unwelcome effect in\naccord with simple exceptionless mechanical laws. Berkeley understood\nthem as assemblages of visual ideas, conventional signs in a language\nGod employs to point out potentially pleasurable opportunities and\npotentially painful dangers to dependent finite spirits like\nourselves. Turbayne thinks these disparate understandings of physical\nobjects are best viewed not as competing theories but as compatible\nand complementary metaphors.\n\nMetaphor involves the use of a term or other sign in a novel sense\ndifferent from its customary sense, what Turbayne calls\n\u201csort-crossing.\u201d Yet not every sort-crossing, not every\ntrope, counts as a metaphor, just those involving \u201cthe pretense\nthat something is the case when it is not,\u201d as when Descartes\ncandidly says he will describe \u201cthis earth, and generally the\nwhole visible world, as if it were merely a machine\u201d\n(13\u201314). When I say man is a wolf, \u201cthough I give him [man] the\nsame name I do not believe he is another sort of wolf. I only make\nbelieve he is\u2026 That is, I pretend that something is the case\nwhen it is not, and I implicitly ask my audience to do the same\u201d\n(14). The pretending here comes with some intending:\n\u201cI intend that [man] shares some of the properties of wolves but\nnot enough of them to classified as an actual wolf.\u201d Similarly\n\u201cwhen I say that vision is a language I intend that vision\nshares some of the properties of language but not enough to let it be\nranged alongside English and French\u201d (15). It appears that what\nI say when I resort to metaphor, what I intend by it in\nTurbayne\u2019s special sense, is whatever it would take to sustain\nmy pretense and render it worthwhile. Pretense about the world goes\nhand in hand with pretense about language: the sense of semantic\nstrain (zeugma) involved in \u201cMen and timber-wolves are\nwolves\u201d shows that the word \u201cwolf\u201d is really being\nused in two different senses even though it is as if it were being\nused in just one (15); there is a shared pretense that the two senses\nare the same (17), despite awareness on all sides that they are really\ndistinct. Often what is expected to sustain and reward such a\npretense, what we intend in pretending, is some set of resemblances\nbetween primary and secondary subjects. But this needn\u2019t be the\ncase, and when it isn\u2019t, metaphor ceases to be a trope of\nresemblance entirely. Poetically ambitious synecdoches and metonymies\nare metaphors without being similitudes.\n\nIt is easy to lose sight of metaphorical pretense. We may mistake the\nmodel for a real instance of what it models, drift from make believe\nto outright belief, confuse the mask with the face beneath it, take\nliterally what was originally meant metaphorically. Turbayne seems to\nthink this happened to Berkeley and his mechanist rivals. They set out\nto offer metaphors but ended up propounding theories; they lost track\nof their own \u201cas ifs\u201d and became victims of their own\ninsights.\n\nTurbayne\u2019s thought about metaphor was a collection of\nundeveloped gestures. It took Kendall Walton (1993) to rediscover\nthese ideas and make an organized theory out of them. Walton has\npioneered an approach to imaginative play in children and its\nanalogues in adult human culture built around the notion of a game\nof make-believe. Such a game is governed by complex, tacit,\nmutually understood rules or norms, principles of generation,\nthat render what\u2019s fictional in the game, what players\nof it are supposed to imagine in playing it, a fixed function of the\nactual states and behaviors of various things and people they\nperceive, manipulate, and otherwise interact with as they play\nit. Walton calls such generators of fictional content\nprops.\n\nIconic and verbal representations of various familiar traditional\nkinds\u2014dolls, hobby horses, statues, paintings, novels\u2014are\ninanimate props, artifacts whose whole raison\nd\u2019\u00eatre is to help generate fictional content in\nmake-believe games of various familiar recurrent kinds. What such\nrepresentations represent is a matter of how they stand ready to\nfunction as props, how they stand ready to shape fictional content by\nhelping to generate it when games of these familiar recurrent kinds\nactually get played. Actors, on the other hand, are animate\nprops, props of a peculiarly active and self-conscious kind. They help\nto author and direct (in their capacity as autonomous agents) the\nfictional content they help to generate (in their capacity as props)\nand go on to consume (in their capacity as obedient imaginers). Actors\nbehave so as to deliberately shape what comes out fictional in the\ngames they play with one another and with salient inanimate bits of\nthe world around them, thereby deliberately orchestrating their own\nimaginings and those of their fellow players.\n\nThe most conspicuous games of make-believe, those involving\npremeditated acting, prefabricated representations, or both, are games\nwhose players vividly and eagerly imagine what they are supposed to\nimagine under the rules because doing so is intrinsically satisfying\nin some way. Props in such games are means to imaginative ends,\nderiving their instrumental value or interest from the intrinsic value\nor interest of the fictional content they help generate. Such games\nare content oriented. Examples include playing cops and\nrobbers, putting on Hamlet, reading a novel for the sake of\nits story. Walton (1990) analyzed various important modes of\nrepresentation in and outside the arts\u2014depiction, narration,\ndramatic enactment, etc.\u2014in terms of the special sorts of prop\nand special sorts of principle of generation characteristic of such\nanthropologically conspicuous, intrinsically satisfying, content\noriented games.\n\nBut not all games of make-believe are like this. Sometimes the games\nwe play and the fictions we generate in the course of playing them owe\nmuch of their value and interest to the manner in which they enable us\nto perceive, conceive, and manipulate their own props. Sometimes our\nthought and speech about objects that already really exist and are\nalready of vital interest to us can be helpfully structured or\nrestructured by pressing these objects into service as props in a\nsuitable game of make-believe, turning them for the time being into\nimprovised representations of something almost entirely different.\nPretend for a moment that Italy is a boot, turn Italy for the time\nbeing into an improvised representation of a boot, and you have a\nreadymade scheme for locating particular Italian cities in relation to\neach other, deriving from familiar established ways of thinking and\ntalking about boots and their component parts. Games of this second\nsort are prop oriented (Walton 1993). Since little turns on\nhow vividly we imagine the things such games call on us to imagine, we\nmay be only dimly aware of playing them even as we do so. Yet we are\nare remarkably skilled at playing such games with one another on a\npickup basis, never formulating, let alone stipulating, the principles\nof generation that govern our imaginative collaborations for as long\nas they last.\n\nHearing \u201cJuliet is the sun\u201d in its concrete conversational\nsetting, we come to suspect that Romeo is imagining his new love to\njust plain be exactly that, the sun. We come to suspect that Romeo is\nenabled to imagine this and in his personal opinion\ncalled on to image it by the rules of a game of make-believe\nhe spontaneously finds himself playing, a game we attempt to join him\nin playing as we struggle to make appropriate sense of his words.\nRomeo imagines Juliet to be the sun because he feels called on to do\nso, and he feels called on to do so because of the rules he takes\nhimself to be playing by (on the one hand) and what he seriously\nbelieves about Juliet herself (on the other).\n\nPerhaps Romeo\u2019s game is such that in going through the motions\nof asserting that Juliet is the sun, he renders it fictional that he\ndoes assert this and does so sincerely and truthfully. (Many games of\nmake-believe do work this way, after all.) If so, his utterance is an\nact of verbal participation in the game on which it comments,\na fiction-generating move in the game under the rules: going\nthrough the motions of asserting that Juliet is the sun will\nfictionally count as sincerely and truthfully asserting this very\nthing. Or perhaps not: perhaps Romeo isn\u2019t pretending to say or\nassert anything at all in speaking as he does. Perhaps he isn\u2019t\nspeaking in his capacity as make-believe actor at all; perhaps he\nspeaks merely in his other capacities as make-believe author and\ndirector and audience. In either case, his words serve to signal an\nunderstanding on his part that it is fictional in the game he\u2019s\nplaying that Juliet is the sun: an understanding on his part that\nunder the rules of the game that he and any suitably attuned listeners\nare playing together, he and they are to imagine Juliet to be the\nsun\u2014imagine her to just plain be exactly that.\n\nAs we have already seen, this understanding on Romeo\u2019s part is\nin turn a joint product and joint expression of his working\nunderstanding of the rules he\u2019s playing by (on the one hand) and\nhis working understanding of what Juliet herself is actually like (on\nthe other). So: what would Romeo\u2019s signal do for a listener who\nis already suitably attuned with him, a listener already reliably\ndisposed to play by the same rules he plays by? It would ascribe to\nJuliet the properties that in Romeo\u2019s opinion render it\nfictional that she is the sun, the properties that in\nRomeo\u2019s opinion make the role of the sun fall to her,\nunder those rules. And these are the very properties that turn up in a\nsuccessful paraphrase of Romeo\u2019s utterance when it gets taken as\na metaphor. We listeners undertake to discover what properties these\nare by responding to Romeo\u2019s utterance as a make-believe signal,\ndoing our best to enter into the spirit of a game already in progress,\nand reflecting on the rules we find ourselves playing by if and when\nwe succeed in doing so.\n\nAt any rate, this is how things go in the basic case. Sometimes the\nrules by which the maker of a metaphor is playing are so familiar and\nstereotyped that we can recover them without any prior effort to join\nin and play along, in which case we may not bother to do so. For that\nmatter, sometimes the initiator of the game may merely go through the\nmotions of playing it himself, failing to imagine the things he is\nnominally called on to imagine by make-believe signals he himself\nemits, in which case he merely alludes to a game that even he\ndoesn\u2019t bother to play.\n\nAll of which suggests the broad outlines of a novel account of how we\ngo about interpreting many metaphors:\n\nThe metaphorical statement (in its context) implies or suggests or\nintroduces or calls to mind a (possible) game of make-believe. The\nutterance may be an act of verbal participation in the implied game,\nor it may merely be the utterance of a sentence that could be used in\nparticipating in the game. In saying what she does, the speaker\ndescribes things that are or would be props in the implied game. It\nmay be possible in favorable cases to paraphrase what she says about\nthem with reasonable fidelity. Typically, the paraphrase will specify\nfeatures of the props by virtue of which it would be fictional in the\nimplied game that the speaker speaks truly, if her utterance is an act\nof verbal participation in it.
