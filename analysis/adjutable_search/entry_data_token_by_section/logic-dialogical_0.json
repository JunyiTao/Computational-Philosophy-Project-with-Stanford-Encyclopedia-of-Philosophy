A Brief Overview of Dialogical Logic\n\nIn the dialogical framework the meaning of an expression is explained\nin game-theoretic terms, as opposed to the main-stream model-theoretic\nsemantics. In this fashion, the meaning of the logical constants is\nexplained by means of rules prescribing how to use these constants in\nargumentation games. Various traditions can be distinguished in the\ngame-theoretical approach (see also Rahman & Keiff 2005):\n\n\n\nThe constructivist tradition of Paul Lorenzen and Kuno Lorenz.\n\nThis is the main tradition of dialogical logic and the present entry\nwill focus on it and its recent developments. Dialogical logic is\nconsidered (especially by Lorenz) as a semantic project, and was\ninitially developed in order to overcome the limitations of operative\nlogic (Lorenzen 1955; see also Schroeder-Heister 2008). Dialogues are\nfinitary games about an initial formula, which is said to be\nvalid if, and only if, the proponent has a winning\nstrategy for it (see\n Section 2.1.2).\nExpanding this tradition, Shahid Rahman and collaborators have made dialogical logic a framework for expressing various logics other than the initial intuitionistic logic, as presented in \n Section 2.2\n (see in particular Rahman 1993, Rahman and R\u00fcckert 2001, Rahman and Keiff 2005).  \n\nWalter Felscher (1985) follows a common method for writing winning strategies\n(Lorenzen & Lorenz 1978; Lorenz 1981) that uses the semantic\ntableaux of Beth (1955), and his technical achievements have strongly\ninfluenced some logicians when working with the dialogical framework\nor some variation of it, notably S\u00f8rensen and Urzyczyn (2007);\nAlama et al. (2011); Uckelman et al. (2014); Dutilh Novaes (2015; 2020);\nDutilh Novaes and French (2018); French (2021). Another author which\nhad considerable influence for these works is Christian Ferm\u00fcller, for\nexample Ferm\u00fcller (2003). \n\n\nThe game-theoretical tradition of Jaakko Hintikka (1968), called GTS\n(see the\n entry on independence friendly logic).\n\nThis tradition shares the game-theoretical tenets of dialogical logic\nfor logical constants, but switches to standard model theory at the\nlevel of elementary statements, for which standard truth-functional\nformal semantics comes into play. \n\n\nThe argumentation theory tradition of Else Barth and Erick Krabbe\n(1982; see also Gethmann 1979).\n\nThis tradition links dialogical logic with informal logic (or critical\nreasoning), which originated in the work of Perelman and\nOlbrechts-Tyteca (1958), and studies the underlying logical\nregularities of concrete dialogues. In this tradition figures\nToulmin\u2019s argumentation theory (Toulmin 1958), Barth and\nKrabbe\u2019s theory of dialogue (Barth & Krabbe 1982), Douglas\nWalton (1984), Ralph Johnson (1999), Woods\u2019 argumentation theory\n(Woods 1989; Woods et al. 2000), and critical thinking (Anand\nJayprakash Vaidya 2013, among others). \n\n\nThe ludics tradition of Jean-Yves Girard (2001).\n\nThis tradition provides an overall theory of proof-theoretical meaning\nbased on interactive computation. Andreas Blass (1992) proposed a\ndialogical semantics (in the sense of tradition 1) for linear logics,\nto which ludics is often associated. \n\n\nThe recent developments of dialogical logic in constructive\nmathematics.\n\nNew developments in this field are becoming more and more important\nand it can safely be called a full-fledged tradition. Nowadays, these\ndevelopments are deeply related to the links between dialogical logic\nand constructive type theory, and have even started to make\ninteresting connections with new programs in Philosophy of Mathematics\nsuch as Homotopy Theory. Prominent works related to this field are for\ninstance Coquand (1995) and Sterling (2021). \n\n\nThese traditions sometimes share common features, sometimes challenge\nfeatures of other traditions, sometimes try to make links with other\ntraditions. Thus, traditions 1 and 3 share an epistemic and\nproof-theoretical background. Traditions 2 and 3 challenge the\ndialogical conception of logic of tradition 1 in order to bring about\na framework in which meaning is not reduced to a formal approach, but\nis understood as setting out content. Recent works claim to answer\nthis kind of challenge while still staying within tradition 1 (see\n Section 3.2).\n Other recent efforts have tried to link traditions 1 and 3: Prakken\n(2005), for example, focuses on logical analysis in the context of\nlegal reasoning and non-monotonic reasoning; more recent and quite\ndifferent perspectives explore substructural approaches to paradoxes\nin terms of natural argumentation and its treatment in a\ngame-theoretical setting inspired by tradition 1 (French 2015; Dutilh\nNovaes & French 2018; Dutilh Novaes 2020). The present entry focuses on the original\nwork of Lorenzen and Lorenz (tradition 1) with its developments during\nthe last decades. Historical remarks on the relations between logic\nand dialogues can be found in\n the entry on logic and games,\n and in Lorenz (2001).\n\nSection 2\n presents the essential features of the standard dialogical framework,\nand how it can accommodate various logics.\n Section 3\n presents two variations on the standard framework: a first that\nendeavors to stay within tradition 1; a second that emancipates itself\nfrom tradition 1 while stressing the merits of such a dialogical\napproach for dealing with problems of philosophy of logic.\n",
