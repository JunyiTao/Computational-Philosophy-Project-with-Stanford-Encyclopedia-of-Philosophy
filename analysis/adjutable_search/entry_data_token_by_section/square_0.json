    "main_text": "Introduction\n1. Introduction\n\n\nThe doctrine of the square of opposition originated with Aristotle in\nthe fourth century BC and has occurred in logic texts ever since.\nAlthough severely criticized in recent decades, it is still regularly\nreferred to. The point of this entry is to trace its history from the\nvantage point of the early twenty-first century, along with closely\nrelated doctrines bearing on empty terms. \n\n\nThe square of opposition is a group of theses embodied in a diagram.\nThe diagram is not essential to the theses; it is just a useful way to\nkeep them straight. The theses concern logical relations among four\nlogical forms:\n\n\n\nNAME\nFORM\nTITLE\n\n\nA\nEvery S is P\nUniversal Affirmative\n\n\nE\nNo S is P\nUniversal Negative\n\n\nI\nSome S is P\nParticular Affirmative\n\n\nO\nSome S is not P\nParticular Negative\n\n\n\n\n\nThe diagram for the traditional square of opposition is: \n\n\n\nThe theses embodied in this diagram I call \u2018SQUARE\u2019.\nThey are:\n\nSQUARE\n\n\u2018Every S is P\u2019 and \u2018Some\nS is not P\u2019 are contradictories.\n\n\n\u2018No S is P\u2019 and \u2018Some\nS is P\u2019 are contradictories.\n\n\n\u2018Every S is P\u2019 and \u2018No\nS is P\u2019 are contraries.\n\n\n\u2018Some S is P\u2019 and \u2018Some\nS is not P\u2019 are subcontraries.\n\n\n\u2018Some S is P\u2019 is a subaltern of\n\u2018Every S is P\u2019.\n\n\n\u2018Some S is not P\u2019 is a\nsubaltern of \u2018No S is P\u2019.\n\n\n\nThese theses were supplemented with the following explanations: \n\nTwo propositions are contradictory iff they cannot both be true and\nthey cannot both be false.\n\n\nTwo propositions are contraries iff they cannot both be true but\ncan both be false.\n\n\nTwo propositions are subcontraries iff they cannot both be false\nbut can both be true.\n\n\nA proposition is a subaltern of another iff it must be true if its\nsuperaltern is true, and the superaltern must be false if the subaltern\nis false.\n\n\n\nProbably nobody before the twentieth century ever held exactly these\nviews without holding certain closely linked ones as well. The most\ncommon closely linked view that is associated with the traditional\ndiagram is that the E and I\npropositions convert simply; that is, \u2018No S is\nP\u2019 is equivalent in truth value to \u2018No P\nis S\u2019, and \u2018Some S is P\u2019\nis equivalent in truth value to \u2018Some P is\nS\u2019. The traditional doctrine supplemented with simple\nconversion is a very natural view to discuss. It is Aristotle\u2019s view,\nand it was widely endorsed (or at least not challenged) before the late 19th century. I call this\ntotal body of doctrine \u2018[SQUARE]\u2019:\n[SQUARE] =df SQUARE + \u201cthe E and I forms convert\nsimply\u201d\n\n\nwhere \nA proposition converts simply iff it is\nnecessarily equivalent in truth value to the proposition you get by\ninterchanging its terms.\n\n\nSo [SQUARE] includes the relations illustrated in the diagram plus the\nview that \u2018No S is P\u2019 is equivalent to\n\u2018No P is S\u2019, and the view that\n\u2018Some S is P\u2019 is equivalent to\n\u2018Some P is S\u2019.\n",
