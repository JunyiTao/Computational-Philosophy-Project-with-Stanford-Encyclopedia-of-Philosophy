    "main_text": "Pains and Pleasures || Felicific Calculus\n3.2 Felicific Calculus\n\nThough Bentham did not use this terminology, the calculus he\ndevised\u2014commonly known as the \u201cfelicific\ncalculus\u201d\u2014describes the elements or dimensions of the\nvalue of a pain or pleasure. To an individual the value of a pain or\npleasure will be more or less according to its\n\u201cintensity\u201d, \u201cduration\u201d, \u201ccertainty or\nuncertainty\u201d, and its \u201cpropinquity or remoteness\u201d.\nWhere the object is to measure the value of a pleasure or pain in\nterms of the tendency of an act, there are two additional\ncircumstances to be taken into account: \u201cfecundity\u201d or\n\u201cthe chance it has of being followed by sensations of the\nsame kind\u201d, and \u201cpurity\u201d or \u201cthe\nchance it has of not being followed by sensations of the\nopposite kind\u201d. Where there are a number of persons,\nwith reference to whom the value of a pleasure or a pain is\nconsidered, a further circumstance must be factored into the calculus,\nthat is the \u201cextent\u201d or the number of persons who are\naffected by the pleasure or pain (1970, 38\u201339). Although Bentham\nbelieved there was nothing in what he had proposed \u201cbut what the\npractice of mankind, wheresoever they have a clear view of their own\ninterest, is perfectly conformable to\u201d, it has often been said\nthat applying the felicific calculus is impractical. Bentham\nrecognised that neither the individual nor the legislator could\nstrictly follow the process he described. Rather, he presented it as a\nmodel of the ideal calculation, and \u201cas near as the process\nactually pursued on these occasions approaches to it, so near will\nsuch process approach to the character of an exact one\u201d (1970,\n40).\n\nAs is well known, while adhering to the basic Benthamic analysis of\nmotives, in Utilitarianism (1861) J. S. Mill introduced the\nconcept of\u201chigher pleasures\u201d, by which he meant aesthetic\nand spiritual gratification and the pleasures of the intellect, and\nclaimed these were intrinsically more desirable than other pleasures.\nThis tended to undermine the aggregative dimension of the theory laid\ndown by Bentham, since the depth of feeling associated with such\npleasures resist quantification. Recent commentators, however, have\nquestioned whether the distance between Bentham and Mill is as large\nas commonly supposed, arguing for example that \u201cintensity\u201d\nand \u201cpurity\u201d are qualities of pains and pleasures that, in\nprinciple, are still subject to measurement, at least when comparing\nalternative actions on the same index (Warke 2000; Rosen 2003, Ch.\n10).\n",
