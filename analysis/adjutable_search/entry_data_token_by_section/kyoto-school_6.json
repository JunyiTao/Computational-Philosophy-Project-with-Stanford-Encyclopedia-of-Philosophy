    "main_text": "Absolute Nothingness: Giving Philosophical Form to the Formless || The Buddhist and Daoist Background for the Idea of Absolute Nothingness\n3.2 The Buddhist and Daoist Background for the Idea of Absolute Nothingness\n\nBefore looking more specifically at how Nishida and other members of\nthe Kyoto School attempt to give philosophical form to the formless,\nit will be helpful to look at some of the threads in Eastern\ntraditions on which the Kyoto School thinkers are explicitly and\nimplicitly drawing as they weave their texts on absolute\nnothingness.\n\nTheir explicit references are primarily to Mah\u0101y\u0101na\nBuddhism, especially to the East Asian Buddhist schools of Zen\n(predominantly the Rinzai tradition but also notably D\u014dgen of\nS\u014dt\u014d) and Pure Land (predominantly Shinran\u2019s Shin)\nBuddhism. The key Sanskrit term in Mah\u0101y\u0101na Buddhism here is\n\u015b\u016bnyat\u0101 (\u201cemptiness\u201d;\nk\u016b in Japanese). With the noteworthy exception of the\nlater Nishitani, however, the Kyoto School tends to favor the Chinese\nglyph mu (\u201cnothingness\u201d; wu in Chinese),\nwhich is found predominantly in Zen, and which reflects the early\nattempt to \u201cmatch terms\u201d with Daoism in the translation\nand interpretive development of Buddhism in China. Let us briefly\nexamine both of these Asian sources for the Kyoto School\u2019s\nphilosophies of absolute nothingness, \u015b\u016bnyat\u0101\nand\n wu/mu.[7]\n\nIn Mah\u0101y\u0101na Buddhism \u015b\u016bnyat\u0101 refers\nfirst of all to the fact that all things come into being in\n\u201cinterdependent origination\u201d (Sanskrit:\nprat\u012btya-samutp\u0101da; Japanese: engi), and\nthey are therefore \u201cempty\u201d of any independent substantial\nself-nature or \u201cown-being\u201d (Sanskrit:\nsvabh\u0101va). This thought is closely tied to the basic\nBuddhist thesis of \u201cno-ego\u201d (Sanskrit:\nan\u0101tman; Japanese: muga). All beings, including\nthe ego, are interconnected and in flux. Psychologically,\n\u015b\u016bnyat\u0101 refers also to the releasement from\nall attachment to beings, from all reification and willful\nappropriation of them. Such attachments are both based on and in turn\nsupport the primary attachment to the fabricated ego, since the ego\nboth strives to possess and is unwittingly possessed by its\nreification of beings. To awaken to the emptiness of all things, to\ntheir lack of substantial own-being or egoity (Japanese:\nshogy\u014dmuga), therefore, is to free oneself from both an\nego-centered and reified view of things as well as from the illusion\nof the substantial ego itself.\n\nYet, if the movement of negation stops here at a one-sided negation of\nbeing (i.e., at negation of the illusory independent substantial\nreality of things and the ego), then the idea of\n\u201cemptiness\u201d is not itself\n emptied.[8]\n That would leave us with either a pessimistic nihilism or,\nironically, a reified view of emptiness itself. These are what the\nBuddhist tradition calls \u201cemptiness-sickness\u201d (Japanese:\nk\u016bby\u014d). True emptiness must be understood to\ndynamically negate the very opposition of being and (relative)\nnothingness (see Nakamura 1975, Vol. 1, 278). Hence, in\nMah\u0101y\u0101na we find an explicit return\u2014through a\n\u201cgreat negation\u201d of a reified misunderstanding of\nbeing\u2014to a \u201cgreat affirmation\u201d of a non-reified\nunderstanding of being. Emptiness thoroughly understood is nothing\nseparate from or opposed to \u201cbeing\u201d properly understood.\nAs the often chanted lines of the Heart Sutra put it:\n\u201c[phenomenal] form is emptiness; emptiness is also [phenomenal]\nform; emptiness is no other than form; form is no other than\nemptiness\u201d (see Bercholz & Kohn 1993, 155). The famous\nMah\u0101y\u0101na Buddhist philosopher of\n\u015b\u016bnyat\u0101 N\u0101g\u0101rjuna (ca. 150\u2013250\nCE) went so far as to provocatively state: \u201cThe limits (i.e.,\nrealm) of nirv\u0101na are the limits of\nsams\u0101ra. Between the two, also, there is not the\nslightest difference whatsoever\u201d (Inada 1993, 158). In other\nwords, nirv\u0101na is neither a nihilistic extinction of nor\na transcendent escape from the phenomenal world\n(sams\u0101ra); it is rather an enlightened manner of\nbeing-in-the-world here and now (see Garfield 1995, 332). This radical\nreaffirmation of the phenomenal world was particularly stressed in\nEast Asian developments of Mah\u0101y\u0101na Buddhism, where we find\nsuch remarkably affirmative phrases as: \u201ctrue emptiness,\nmarvelous being\u201d (Japanese: shink\u016b-my\u014du).\n\nEven though he never disavows the term Nishida coined, \u201cabsolute\nnothingness\u201d (zettai-mu), in his mature writings\nNishitani explicitly employs the Mah\u0101y\u0101na term\n\u201cemptiness\u201d (\u015b\u016bnyat\u0101,\nk\u016b) in his attempt to think a way beyond both the\nexacerbated attachment to being and the reactive nihilism that\ntogether plague the modern world (see Ueda 2011a). Nishitani writes as\nfollows: On the one hand, emptiness can be termed \u201can absolute\nnegativity, inasmuch as it is a standpoint that has negated and\nthereby transcended nihility, which was itself the\ntranscendence-through-negation of all being.\u201d In this sense,\n\u201cemptiness can well be described as \u2018outside\u2019 of and\nabsolutely \u2018other\u2019 than the standpoint shackled to being,\nprovided we avoid the misconception that emptiness is some\n\u2018thing\u2019 distinct from being and subsisting\n\u2018outside\u2019 it.\u201d On the other hand, then, emptiness is\ntruly emptiness \u201conly when it empties itself even of the\nstandpoint that represents it as some \u2018thing\u2019 that is\nemptiness. \u2026 [True emptiness] is to be realized as something\nunited to and self-identical with being\u201d (NKC X, 109\u201310;\nNishitani 1982, 97). Following in the wake of Nishida\u2019s\ntopological thinking of absolute nothingness (see subsection 3.3\nbelow), Nishitani also thinks of emptiness as a \u201cplace\u201d or\n\u201cfield\u201d (ba) wherein beings can appear as they\ntruly are in their proper basis or \u201chome-ground\u201d\n(moto).\n\nThe idea of a nothingness that radically transcends, or underlies,\nboth being and its simple negation can also be traced back to\npre-Buddhist Chinese thought. A Chinese scholar laments the\nphilosophical ambiguity inherent in the Chinese character wu\n(nothingness). He writes that \u201cin Chinese\n\u2018wu\u2019 can mean both the contrasting pair of\n\u2018you\u2019 [i.e., \u2018being\u2019] and the\nmetaphysical source of both \u2018you\u2019 and\n\u2018wu\u2019\u201d (Zhang 2002, 150). In the terminology\nof the Kyoto School, the former sense of wu (mu in\nJapanese) is a matter of \u201crelative nothingness,\u201d while the\nlatter sense is akin to what they call \u201cabsolute\nnothingness.\u201d The latter sense of wu is expressed in\nchapter 40 of the Daodejing as follows: \u201cThe myriad\nthings under heaven are generated from being. Being is generated from\nnothingness (wu).\u201d This unnamable non-dualistic source\nof all being and relative non-being is also referred to as the Way\n(dao). Of the latter it is said, in chapter 14 of the\nDaodejing: \u201cIt is called the shapeless shape, the image\nof no-thing\u201d (see Izutsu 2001, 50\u201351 and 104). It is not\nhard to link this thought with Nishida\u2019s professed intention of\ngiving philosophical foundation to the \u201cform of the\nformless\u201d that he maintained lies at the heart of the traditions\nof the East.\n\nIn the Daoist tradition we also find an idea of nothingness used in\nthe context of radically emptying the mind in order to attune the\nfinite self to the\n in-finite[9]\n rhythm of the Way. The Zhuangzi speaks in this regard of the\npractice of \u201csitting down and forgetting everything\u201d and\nof \u201cbeing empty like a mirror\u201d (see Watson 1968, 90 and\n97). When Zen talks of returning to one\u2019s \u201coriginal face\nbefore one\u2019s parents were born,\u201d we find the Daoist ideas\nof \u201cforgetting the ego\u201d and \u201creturning to the\nroot\u201d combined with the Mah\u0101y\u0101na Buddhist notion of\nthe \u201coriginal purity of the mind.\u201d The original brightness\nand purity of the mind, which lies hidden beneath the clouds of\ndefiling passion, is also frequently expressed in Mah\u0101y\u0101na\ntexts with the analogy of a mirror that is able to spontaneously\nreflect the world without egoistic discriminations.\n\nZen presumably inherits this analogy of the original mind as mirror\nfrom both Mah\u0101y\u0101na and Daoist sources. In the traditional\nedition of The Platform Sutra of the Sixth Patriarch,\nhowever, all residues of dualistic discrimination\u2014including\nthose that remain even in the notion of a mirror that needs to be\ncontinually wiped clean of impurities\u2014are swept away in the\nfamous lines: \u201cOriginally there is not a single thing\u201d\n(Chinese: benlai wu-yi-wu; Japanese: honrai\nmu-ichi-motsu). In this quintessential Zen expression are wedded\ntogether the meontological and psychological senses of\nwu/mu: a rejection of an ontology of independent\nsubstances, a declaration of an originary (self-negating) nothingness,\nand an expression of a radical freedom from egoistic attachment as\nwell as freedom for spontaneous creativity and compassion.\n\nIn Zen we find the Mah\u0101y\u0101na Buddhist notion of emptiness and\nthe Daoist notion of nothingness fully intertwined and developed into\na practice of living both completely unattached and completely engaged\nin the world of \u201ctrue emptiness, marvelous being.\u201d In the\nfamous wu or mu k\u014dan that opens the\nGateless Barrier, Wumen (Mumon) urges those who wish to reach\nenlightenment, that is, those who wish to pass through the\n\u201cbarrier of the gate of nothingness,\u201d to concentrate their\nentire life force on this wu (mu), taking care to\nunderstand it neither as \u201cnihilistic nothingness\u201d nor\n\u201cin terms of being and non-being\u201d (Nishimura 1994, 22; see\nCleary 1999, 71). This was the k\u014dan that Nishida finally passed\nafter nearly a decade of intense practice of Zen (see Yusa 2002,\n45ff.). And as Nishida confided many years later to Nishitani, it was\nfrom early on his \u201cimpossible desire\u201d to somehow bring Zen\nand philosophy together (NKZ XIX, 224\u201325). Even more than did\nNishida, several subsequent Kyoto School philosophers, most notably\nNishitani, Hisamatsu, Abe, and Ueda, explicitly endeavored to bring\nthe practice as well as the thought of Zen into relation with\nphilosophy (see Davis 2021; 2022, 275\u201389).\n",
