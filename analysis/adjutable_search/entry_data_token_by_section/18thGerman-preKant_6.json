    "main_text": "The Controversy between Wolff and the Pietists || The Controversy and its Aftermath\n3.3 The Controversy and its Aftermath\n\nThe controversy between Wolff and his Pietist colleagues is not\ntypically held to be of much philosophical significance. Rather, the\nPietists\u2019 hostility towards Wolff is taken to be a reflection of\ntheir fundamentally un-enlightened anti-intellectualism, and the\noutbreak of the controversy itself a result of personal and\nprofessional rivalries\u2014competition for students and university\nchairs. That this appraisal is generally accepted is to no small\nextent due to the efforts of subsequent histories of the dispute\nwritten by devoted Wolffians, such as C. G. Ludovici (1707\u201378)\nand Georg Volckmar Hartmann (fl. 1729\u20131737). And while it cannot\nbe denied that the voluminous texts exchanged during the course of the\ncontroversy, on both sides, only infrequently rise above the level of\nthe polemical, it would be unfair to dismiss the ground of the\nPietists\u2019 objections as philosophically insignificant, or indeed\nirrelevant for the subsequent development of German philosophy (up to\nand including Kant).\n\nThe controversy itself was the result of long-simmering tensions\nbetween Wolff and the Pietists. Wolff\u2019s turn to lecturing on\nphilosophical topics, such as metaphysics (including a treatment of\nnatural theology), beginning in 1710, not to mention his discussion in\nthe German Logic of Scriptural interpretation, provoked the\nire of the theology faculty and led to warnings to their students\nabout attending Wolff\u2019s lectures (on account of his\n\u201cAtheisterey\u201d; cf. Beutel 2007: 165\u20136). The\npublication of Wolff\u2019s German Metaphysics in 1719, with\nits peculiar proof of God\u2019s existence and apparent endorsement\nof natural necessitation, provided a broad target for their critical\nattention. This largely behind-the-scenes friction broke into the open\nwith Wolff\u2019s address on 12 July 1721, on the occasion of the\ntransition of the pro-rectorship from himself to Lange, in which he\ndefended the consistency of Confucian (i.e., non-Christian) practical\nphilosophy with Enlightened reason (and Wolffian moral philosophy in\nparticular; cf. M. Albrecht 1985).\n\nThe address caused an uproar among the Pietists and Francke demanded\nto see a copy of Wolff\u2019s address to scrutinize for himself,\nwhich request Wolff denied citing the independence of the philosophy\nfaculty. Lange at this point took up the study of Wolff\u2019s\nmetaphysics, penning a damning appraisal for the theology faculty that\nwas sent to the authorities in Berlin. Wolff was invited to reply, and\nhis rejection of the hostile characterization of his views led to the\nformation of an official commission in late October 1723 to\ninvestigate the charges against Wolff. The king himself would soon\nintervene, and decisively: after the dangers of Wolffian philosophy\nwere explained to two of his generals visiting Halle\u2014the\ndoctrine of the pre-established harmony in particular was said to\njustify the desertion of soldiers (Beutel 2001: 189)\u2014and this\nthreat conveyed to the king, Friedrich Wilhelm I asked his trusted\nadvisor Francke to outline the problematic doctrines defended by\nWolff, which he promptly did. Horrified by Wolff\u2019s evident\ngodlessness, the king dismissed Wolff from his position and ordered\nhim to leave Prussia in 48 hours on pain of hanging, an order that was\nreceived in Halle on 12 November 1723. Wolff reacted swiftly, crossing\nover to nearby Electoral Saxony, refunding his students\u2019 fees,\nand ultimately took up the offer of a position in Marburg where he\nreceived an enthusiastic reception.\n\nWolff\u2019s expulsion only meant that the dispute moved into the\npublic domain, and the next decade would see dozens of treatises\nexchanged between Wolff (and his defenders) and his opponents, Lange\nand Budde foremost among them. A range of issues were canvassed in the\ndebate. So, the issue of the libertas philosophandi had\nalready surfaced in the conflict between the philosophical and\ntheological faculties, and there were significant differences between\nWolff and the Pietists concerning the ground of moral obligation\n(Grote 2017); however, the principal topics were metaphysical. These\ninclude the pre-established harmony, which Lange rejected as\ninconsistent with any proper union between soul and body, defending\ninstead a natural connection between them achieved through physical\ninflux (Lange 1724: 48\u201350 [2019: 141\u20132]).\n\nEven so, the Pietists\u2019 foremost philosophical concern was with\npreserving the genuine freedom of the human (and divine) will against\nWolff\u2019s Leibniz-inspired assaults (cf. Bianco 1989). According\nto Lange, Wolff\u2019s endorsement of the principle of sufficient\nreason has the consequence of reducing the soul to an automaton and\nrendering the series of events that constitute the world a fatally\ndetermined concatenation. The result is a necessitarianism\ndistinguishable from total Spinozism only because Wolff accepts a\nplurality of substances (Lange 1724: 72\u20133 [2019: 153]). Against\nthis, Lange contends that the freedom (rather than mere spontaneity)\nof the will is directly evident through experience (particularly\nthrough our conscience) and constitutes the essence of the human\nbeing, that it is required for morality and religion, and that it\nserves to exempt human beings from the chain of natural necessitation.\nIn spite of his unsympathetic reception in the history of philosophy,\nLange succeeds in outlining a coherent antithesis to the\nLeibnizian-Wolffian conception of the soul and its place in nature,\none that would prove influential for later Pietist critics (like\nCrusius) and that would also form an important part of the background\nto Kant\u2019s own later discussion of freedom.\n\nAfter their initial success with Wolff\u2019s expulsion, Lange and\nthe Pietists suffered diminished influence at the Prussian court. By\ncontrast, the affair only served to burnish Wolff\u2019s European\nreputation. In Prussia, Wolff\u2019s works on metaphysics and\npractical philosophy were added to the list of atheist books, but he\nnow saw himself as speaking to Europeans, not merely Germans, and\nbegan a series of Latin works, commencing with the Philosophia\nrationalis sive logica (Latin Logic) in 1728. Friedrich\nWilhelm I seemed to think better of his precipitous decision and\ninvited Wolff to return to Prussia in 1733, an invitation which Wolff\ndeclined. But the ban on his writings was reversed in 1734, and the\nverdict of an inter-confessional Prussian commission in 1737\nvindicated Wolff\u2019s philosophy of the charges levelled by the\nPietists. The crown prince (later Friedrich II) was an enthusiastic\nbooster of Wolff at the court (and no friend of the Pietists), and\nwith his ascension in 1740 he invited Wolff to return to Prussia.\nAfter turning down the proffered presidency of the Berlin Academy,\nWolff returned to a professor- and vice-chancellorship in Halle to\ngreat acclaim, devoting his remaining time to completing his works on\npractical philosophy.\n",
