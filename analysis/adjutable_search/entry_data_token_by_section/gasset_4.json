During the same\nperiod, Ortega, together with the physician and writer Gregorio\nMara\u00f1\u00f3n (1887\u20131960) and the novelist and poet\nPerez de Ayala, published the manifesto of the \u201cAgupaci\u00f3n\nal Servicio de la Rep\u00fablica\u201d (\u201cGroup in the Service\nof the Republic\u201d), appealing for an association of intellectuals\nand professionals dedicated to the implementation of the goal that\nwould unite all classes and geographical regions under a national\nbanner. The Agrupaci\u00f3n proposed to pursue the path between the\n\u201cdead ends\u201d of Communism and Fascism: a Republic. Ortega\u2019s\npolitical vision and intellectual style provided the inspiration and\nleadership sought by La Agrupaci\u00f3n and Lorca\u2019s intellectual\ncohort after the sudden abdication of Alfonso XIII and the\nproclamation of the Republic on April 14, 1931. Though limited through\nlegal restrictions, La Agrupaci\u00f3n supported the platform of\nSocialist Republican candidates. Fourteen members of the group,\nincluding Ortega, Mara\u00f1\u00f3n and Ayala, were elected in the\nparliamentary elections in June. Ortega was elected to the Constituent\nCortes in the provinces of Le\u00f3n and Ja\u00e9n; he demitted\nthe latter seat. The election returns revealed that Republican\ncandidates received three times as many votes as the Monarchists. The\nConstituent Cortes convened on July 14, a date chosen consciously to\nsymbolize the Second Republic\u2019s identity with the French Revolution of\n1789. The Second Republic, when observed in the broader context of\nEuropean history, was the fifteenth and last of a series of republics\nwhich had been installed during the first decades of the twentieth\ncentury.\n\nAs a member of the Cortes, Ortega experienced the practical\ndifficulties inherent in the nature of political leadership. Manuel\nAza\u00f1a y D\u00edaz (1880\u20131940), a dominant figure in\ngovernment at the time, and his political following continually\nopposed the ideas and leadership of Ortega and his associates of La\nAgrupaci\u00f3n. In the fall of 1932, Ortega left active politics\nwhen communication became virtually impossible due to incessant\narguments and conflicts between the followers of Ortega and\nAza\u00f1a. Daunted but not distressed, Ortega returned to his chair\nof metaphysics at the Central University of Madrid. Between the time\nof his return to the university and the outbreak of the Spanish Civil\nWar, Ortega continued writing political articles in El Sol,\nidentifying and criticizing politicians he thought were primarily\nresponsible for veering the Republic in the wrong direction.\n",
