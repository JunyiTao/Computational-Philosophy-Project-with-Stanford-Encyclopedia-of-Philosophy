    "main_text": "Semantic Theories of Counterfactual Dependence || Summary\n4. Conclusion\n\nPhilosophers, linguists, and psychologists remain fiercely divided on\nhow to best understand counterfactuals. Rightly so. They are at the\ncenter of questions of deep human interest\n (\u00a71).\n The renaissance on this topic in the 1970s and 1980s focused on\naddressing certain semantic puzzles and capturing the logic of\ncounterfactuals\n (\u00a72).\n From this seminal literature, similarity analyses (D.\nLewis 1973b; Stalnaker 1968) have enjoyed\nthe most widespread popularity in philosophy\n (\u00a72.3).\n But the logical debate between similarity and strict analyses is\nstill raging, and strict analyses provide a viable logical alternative\n (\u00a72.4).\n Criticisms of these logical analyses have focused recent debates on\nour intuitions about particular utterances of counterfactuals in\nparticular contexts. Structural equation analyses\n (\u00a73.3)\n have emerged as a particularly prominent alternative to similarity\nand strict analyses, which claims to improve on both in significant\nrespects. These analyses are now being actively developed by\nphilosophers, linguists, psychologists, and computer scientists.\n",
