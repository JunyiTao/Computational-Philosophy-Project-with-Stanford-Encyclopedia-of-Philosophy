    "main_text": "The Humanity Formula\n6. The Humanity Formula\n\nMost philosophers who find Kant\u2019s views attractive find them so\nbecause of the Humanity Formulation of the CI. This formulation states\nthat we should never act in such a way that we treat humanity, whether\nin ourselves or in others, as a means only but always as an end in\nitself. This is often seen as introducing the idea of\n\u201crespect\u201d for persons, for whatever it is that is\nessential to our humanity. Kant was clearly right that this and the\nother formulations bring the CI \u201ccloser to intuition\u201d than\nthe Universal Law formula. Intuitively, there seems something wrong\nwith treating human beings as mere instruments with no value beyond\nthis. But this very intuitiveness can also invite\nmisunderstandings.\n\nFirst, the Humanity Formula does not rule out using people as means to\nour ends. Clearly this would be an absurd demand, since we apparently\ndo this all the time in morally appropriate ways. Indeed, it is hard\nto imagine any life that is recognizably human without the use of\nothers in pursuit of our goals. The food we eat, the clothes we wear,\nthe chairs we sit on and the computers we type at are gotten only by\nway of talents and abilities that have been developed through the\nexercise of the wills of many people. What the Humanity Formula rules\nout is engaging in this pervasive use of humanity in such a way that\nwe treat it as a mere means to our ends. Thus, the difference\nbetween a horse and a taxi driver is not that we may use one but not\nthe other as a means of transportation. Unlike a horse, the taxi\ndriver\u2019s humanity must at the same time be treated as an end in\nitself.\n\nSecond, it is not human beings per se but the\n\u201chumanity\u201d in human beings that we must treat as an end in\nitself. Our \u201chumanity\u201d is that collection of features that\nmake us distinctively human, and these include capacities to engage in\nself-directed rational behavior and to adopt and pursue our own ends,\nand any other rational capacities necessarily connected with these.\nThus, supposing that the taxi driver has freely exercised his rational\ncapacities in pursuing his line of work, we make permissible use of\nthese capacities as a means only if we behave in a way that he could,\nwhen exercising his rational capacities, consent to \u2014 for\ninstance, by paying an agreed on price.\n\nThird, the idea of an end has three senses for Kant, two positive\nsenses and a negative sense. An end in the first positive sense is a\nthing we will to produce or bring about in the world. For instance, if\nlosing weight is my end, then losing weight is something I aim to\nbring about. An end in this sense guides my actions in that once I\nwill to produce something, I then deliberate about and aim to pursue\nmeans of producing it if I am rational. Humanity is not an\n\u201cend\u201d in this sense, though even in this case, the end\n\u201clays down a law\u201d for me. Once I have adopted an end in\nthis sense, it dictates that I do something: I should act in ways that\nwill bring about the end or instead choose to abandon my goal.\n\nAn end in the negative sense lays down a law for me as well, and so\nguides action, but in a different way. Korsgaard (1996) offers\nself-preservation as an example of an end in a negative sense: We do\nnot try to produce our self-preservation. Rather, the end of\nself-preservation prevents us from engaging in certain kinds of\nactivities, for instance, picking fights with mobsters, and so on.\nThat is, as an end, it is something I do not act against in\npursuing my positive ends, rather than something I produce.\n\nHumanity is in the first instance an end in this negative sense: It is\nsomething that limits what I may do in pursuit of my other\nends, similar to the way that my end of self-preservation limits what\nI may do in pursuit of other ends. Insofar as it limits my\nactions, it is a source of perfect duties. Now many of our\nends are subjective in that they are not ends that every rational\nbeing must have. Humanity is an objective end, because it is\nan end that every rational being must have. Hence, my own humanity as\nwell as the humanity of others limit what I am morally\npermitted to do when I pursue my other, non-mandatory, ends.\n\nThe humanity in myself and others is also a positive end,\nthough not in the first positive sense above, as something to be\nproduced by my actions. Rather, it is something to realize, cultivate\nor further by my actions. Becoming a philosopher, pianist or novelist\nmight be my end in this sense. When my end is becoming a pianist, my\nactions do not, or at least not simply, produce something, being a\npianist, but constitute or realize the activity of being a pianist.\nInsofar as the humanity in ourselves must be treated as an end in\nitself in this second positive sense, it must be cultivated,\ndeveloped or fully actualized. Hence, the humanity in oneself is the\nsource of a duty to develop one\u2019s talents or to\n\u201cperfect\u201d one\u2019s humanity. When one makes one\u2019s\nown humanity one\u2019s end, one pursues its development, much as\nwhen one makes becoming a pianist one\u2019s end, one pursues the\ndevelopment of piano playing. And insofar as humanity is a positive\nend in others, I must attempt to further their ends as well. In so\ndoing, I further the humanity in others, by helping further the\nprojects and ends that they have willingly adopted for themselves. It\nis this sense of humanity as an end-in-itself on which some of\nKant\u2019s arguments for imperfect duties rely.\n\nFinally, Kant\u2019s Humanity Formula requires \u201crespect\u201d\nfor the humanity in persons. Proper regard for something with absolute\nvalue or worth requires respect for it. But this can invite\nmisunderstandings. One way in which we respect persons, termed\n\u201cappraisal respect\u201d by Stephen Darwall (1977), is clearly\nnot the same as the kind of respect required by the Humanity Formula:\nI may respect you as a rebounder but not a scorer, or as a researcher\nbut not as a teacher. When I respect you in this way, I am positively\nappraising you in light of some achievement or virtue you possess\nrelative to some standard of success. If this were the sort of respect\nKant is counseling then clearly it may vary from person to person and\nis surely not what treating something as an end-in-itself requires.\nFor instance, it does not seem to prevent me from regarding\nrationality as an achievement and respecting one person as a rational\nagent in this sense, but not another. And Kant is not telling us to\nignore differences, to pretend that we are blind to them on mindless\negalitarian grounds. However, a distinct way in which we respect\npersons, referred to as \u201crecognition respect\u201d by Darwall,\nbetter captures Kant\u2019s position: I may respect you because you\nare a student, a Dean, a doctor or a mother. In such cases of\nrespecting you because of who or what you are, I am giving the proper\nregard to a certain fact about you, your being a Dean for instance.\nThis sort of respect, unlike appraisal respect, is not a matter of\ndegree based on your having measured up to some standard of\nassessment. Respect for the humanity in persons is more like\nDarwall\u2019s recognition respect. We are to respect human beings\nsimply because they are persons and this requires a certain sort of\nregard. We are not called on to respect them insofar as they have met\nsome standard of evaluation appropriate to persons. And, crucially for\nKant, persons cannot lose their humanity by their misdeeds \u2013\neven the most vicious persons, Kant thought, deserve basic respect as\npersons with humanity.\n",
