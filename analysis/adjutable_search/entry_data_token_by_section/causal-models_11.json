    "main_text": "Probabilistic Causal Models || The Markov Condition\n4.2 The Markov Condition\n\nSuppose we have a SEM with endogenous variables \\(\\bV\\), exogenous\nvariables \\(\\bU\\), probability distribution P on \\(\\bU\\) and \\(\\bV\\)\nas described in the previous section, and DAG \\(\\bG\\) representing the\ncausal structure on \\(\\bV\\). Pearl and Verma (1991) prove that if the\nerror variables \\(U_i\\) are probabilistically independent in P, then\nthe probability distribution on \\(\\bV\\) will satisfy the Markov\nCondition (MC) with respect to \\(\\bG\\). The Markov Condition has\nseveral formulations, which are equivalent when \\(\\bG\\) is a a DAG\n(Pearl 1988):\n\n\n(MCScreening_off)\n\nFor every variable X in \\(\\bV\\), and every set of variables\n\\(\\bY \\subseteq \\bV \\setminus \\bDE(X)\\),\n\\(\\Pr(X \\mid \\bPA(X) \\amp \\bY) = \\Pr(X \\mid \\bPA(X))\\).\n\n\n(MCFactorization)\n\nLet \\(\\bV = \\{X_1, X_2 , \\ldots ,X_n\\}\\). Then\n\\(\\Pr(X_1, X_2 , \\ldots ,X_n) = \\prod_i \\Pr(X_i \\mid \\bPA(X_i))\\).\n\n\n(MCd-separation)\n\nLet \\(X, Y \\in \\bV, \\bZ \\subseteq \\bV \\setminus \\{X, Y\\}\\). Then\n\\(\\Pr(X, Y \\mid \\bZ) = \\Pr(X \\mid \\bZ) \\times \\Pr(Y \\mid\n\\bZ)\\)\nif \\(\\bZ\\) d-separates X and Y in \\(\\bG\\)\n(explained below).\n\n\n\nLet us take some time to explain each of these formulations.\n\nMCScreening_off says that the parents of variable X\nscreen X off from all other variables, except for the\ndescendants of X. Given the values of the variables that are\nparents of X, the values of the variables in \\(\\bY\\) (which\nincludes no descendants of \\(X)\\), make no further difference to the\nprobability that X will take on any given value.\n\nMCFactorization tells us that once we know the conditional\nprobability distribution of each variable given its parents, \\(\\Pr(X_i\n\\mid \\bPA(X_i))\\), we can compute the complete joint distribution over\nall of the variables. It is relatively easy to see that MCFactorization follows from MCScreening_off. Since \\(\\bG\\)\nis acyclic, we may re-label the subscripts on the variables so that\nthey are ordered from \u2018earlier\u2019 to \u2018later\u2019,\nwith only earlier variables being ancestors of later ones. It follows\nfrom the probability calculus that \n\n\\[\\Pr(X_1, X_2 , \\ldots ,X_n)  = \\Pr(X_1) \\times \\Pr(X_2 \\mid X_1) \\times \\ldots \\times \\Pr(X_n \\mid X_1, X_2 , \\ldots ,X_{n-1})\\] \n\n (this is a version of\nthe theorem of total probability). For each term \\(\\Pr(X_i \\mid X_1,\nX_2 , \\ldots ,X_{i-1})\\), our ordering ensures that all of the parents\nof \\(X_i\\) will be included on the right hand side, and none of its\ndescendants will. MCScreening_off then tells us that we can\neliminate all of the terms from the right hand side except for the\nparents of \\(X_i\\).\n\nMCd-separation introduces the graphical notion of\nd-separation. As noted above, a path from X to Y\nis a sequence of variables \\(\\langle X = X_1 , \\ldots ,X_k =\nY\\rangle\\) such that for each \\(X_i\\), \\(X_{i+1}\\), there is either an\narrow from \\(X_i\\) to \\(X_{i+1}\\)or an arrow from \\(X_{i+1}\\) to\n\\(X_i\\) in \\(\\bG\\). A variable \\(X_i , 1 \\lt i \\lt k\\) is a\ncollider on the path just in case there is an arrow from\n\\(X_{i-1}\\) to \\(X_i\\) and from \\(X_{i+1}\\) to \\(X_i\\). In other\nwords, \\(X_i\\) is a collider just in case the arrows converge on\n\\(X_i\\) in the path. Let \\(\\bX, \\bY\\), and \\(\\bZ\\) be disjoint subsets\nof \\(\\bV\\). \\(\\bZ\\) d-separates \\(\\bX\\) and \\(\\bY\\) just in case every\npath \\(\\langle X_1 , \\ldots ,X_k\\rangle\\) from a variable in \\(\\bX\\)\nto a variable in \\(\\bY\\) contains at least one variable \\(X_i\\) such\nthat either: (i) \\(X_i\\) is a collider, and no descendant of \\(X_i\\)\n(including \\(X_i\\) itself) is in \\(\\bZ\\); or (ii) \\(X_i\\) is not a\ncollider, and \\(X_i\\) is in \\(\\bZ\\). Any path that meets this\ncondition is said to be blocked by \\(\\bZ\\). If \\(\\bZ\\) does\nnot d-separate \\(\\bX\\) and \\(\\bY\\), then \\(\\bX\\) and \\(\\bY\\)\nare d-connected by \\(\\bZ\\).\n\nNote that MC provides sufficient conditions for variables to be\nprobabilistically independent, conditional on others, but no necessary\ncondition.\n\nHere are some illustrations:\n\n\n\nFigure 6\n\n\nIn\n Figure 6,\n MC implies that X screens Y off from all of the other\nvariables, and W screens Z off from all of the other\nvariables. This is most easily seen from MCScreening_off.\nW also screens T off from all of the other variables,\nwhich is most easily seen from MCd-separation.\nT does not necessarily screen Y off from Z (or\nindeed anything from anything).\n\n\n\nFigure 7\n\n\nIn\n Figure 7,\n MC entails that X and Z will be unconditionally\nindependent, but not that they will be independent conditional on\nY. This is most easily seen from MCd-separation.\n\nLet \\(V_i\\) and \\(V_j\\) be two distinct variables in \\(\\bV\\), with\ncorresponding exogenous error variables \\(U_i\\) and \\(U_j\\),\nrepresenting causes of \\(V_i\\) and \\(V_j\\) that are excluded from the\n\\(\\bV\\). Suppose \\(V_i\\) and \\(V_j\\) share at least one common cause\nthat is excluded from \\(\\bV\\). In this case, we would not expect\n\\(U_i\\) and \\(U_j\\) to be probabilistically independent, and the\ntheorem of Pearl and Verma (1991) would not apply. In this case, the\ncausal relationship among the variables in \\(\\bV\\) would not be\nappropriately represented by a DAG, but would require an acyclic\ndirected mixed graph (ADMG) with a double-headed arrow connecting\n\\(V_i\\) and \\(V_j\\). We will discuss this kind of case in more detail\nin\n Section 4.6\n below.\n\nMC is not expected to hold for arbitrary sets of variables \\(\\bV\\),\neven when the DAG \\(\\bG\\) accurately represents the causal relations\namong those variables. For example, (MC) will typically fail in the\nfollowing kinds of case:\n\nIn an EPR (Einstein-Podolski-Rosen) set-up, we have two particles\nprepared in the singlet state. If X represents a spin\nmeasurement on one particle, Y a spin measurement (in the same\ndirection) on the other, then X and Y are perfectly\nanti-correlated. (One particle will be spin-up just in case the other\nis spin-down.) The measurements can be conducted sufficiently far away\nfrom each other that it is impossible for one outcome to causally\ninfluence the other. However, it can be shown that there is no (local)\ncommon cause Z that screens off the two measurement\noutcomes.\nThe variables in \\(\\bV\\) are not appropriately distinct. For\nexample, suppose that X, Y, and Z are variables\nthat are probabilistically independent and causally unrelated. Now\ndefine \\(U = X + Y\\) and \\(W = Y + Z\\), and let \\(\\bV = \\{U, W\\}\\).\nThen U and W will be probabilistically dependent, even\nthough there is no causal relation between them.\nMC may fail if the variables are too coarsely grained. Suppose\nX, Y, and Z are quantitative variables. Z\nis a common cause of X and Y, and neither X nor\nY causes the other. Suppose we replace Z with a coarser\nvariable, \\(Z'\\) indicating only whether Z is high or low. Then\nwe would not expect \\(Z'\\) to screen X off from Y. The\nvalue of X may well contain information about the value of\nZ beyond what is given by \\(Z'\\), and this may affect the\nprobability of Y.\n\n\nBoth SGS (2000) and Pearl (2009) contain statements of a principle\ncalled the Causal Markov Condition (CMC). The statements are\nin fact quite different from one another. In Pearl\u2019s\nformulation, (CMC) is just a statement of the mathematical theorem\ndescribed above: If each variable in \\(\\bV\\) is a deterministic\nproduct of its parents in \\(\\bV\\), together with an error term; and\nthe errors are probabilistically independent of each other; then the\nprobability distribution on \\(\\bV\\) will satisfy (MC) with respect to\nthe DAG \\(\\bG\\) representing the functional dependence relations among\nthe variables in \\(\\bV\\). Pearl interprets this result in the\nfollowing way: Macroscopic systems, he believes, are deterministic. In\npractice, however, we never have access to all of the causally\nrelevant variables affecting a macroscopic system. But if we include\nenough variables in our model so that the excluded variables are\nprobabilistically independent of one another, then our model will\nsatisfy the MC, and we will have a powerful set of analytic tools for\nstudying the system. Thus MC characterizes a point at which we have\nconstructed a useful approximation of the complete system.\n\nIn SGS (2000), the (CMC) has more the status of an empirical posit. If\n\\(\\bV\\) is set of macroscopic variables that are well-chosen, meaning\nthat they are free from the sorts of defects described above; \\(\\bG\\)\nis a DAG representing the causal structure on \\(\\bV\\); and P is the\nempirical probability distribution resulting from this causal\nstructure; then P can be expected to satisfy MC relative to \\(\\bG\\).\nThey defend this assumption in (at least) two ways:\n\nEmpirically, it seems that a great many systems do in fact satisfy\nMC.\nMany of the methods that are in fact used to detect causal\nrelationships tacitly presuppose the MC. In particular, the use of\nrandomized trials presupposes a special case of the MC. Suppose that\nan experimenter determines randomly which subjects will receive\ntreatment with a drug \\((D = 1)\\) and which will receive a placebo\n\\((D = 0)\\), and that under this regimen, treatment is\nprobabilistically correlated with recovery \\((R)\\). The effect of\nrandomization is to eliminate all of the parents of D, so MC\ntells us that if R is not a descendant of D, then\nR and D should be probabilistically independent. If we\ndo not make this assumption, how can we infer from the experiment that\nD is a cause of R?\n\n\nCartwright (1993, 2007: chapter 8) has argued that MC need not hold\nfor genuinely indeterministic systems. Hausman and Woodward (1999,\n2004) attempt to defend MC for indeterministic systems.\n\nA causal model that comprises a DAG and a probability distribution\nthat satisfies MC is called a causal Bayes net.\n",
