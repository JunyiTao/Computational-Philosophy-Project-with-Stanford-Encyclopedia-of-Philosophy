    "main_text": "Logical Doctrines under Dispute || Modal Propositions and Modal Syllogisms\n2.3 Modal Propositions and Modal Syllogisms\nThere were a number of modal systems developed and debated among\nthe Arabic logicians. The material devoted to the topic is too\nvoluminous for anything more than a sketchy account of one line of\ndevelopment and debate. I follow a few aspects of Avicenna's\nsyllogistic through its treatment in the thirteenth century, and its\ntransformation into a compact body of doctrine taught in the\nmadrasa. With regret, in this redaction of the entry I omit mention of\nAlfarabi and Averroes, not because they are not important, but\nbecause, first, Alfarabi's most important treatment of the syllogistic\nis lost and, secondly, Averroes stands outside the Avicennan tradition\nof logic.\n\nIt will become clear that Avicenna's syllogistic puzzled those who\ncame after him, and still puzzles those today who try to work out what\nAvicenna was doing. There is some ground to think that Avicenna's\nsyllogistic is, from a systematic point of view, something of a\nfailure; that was a fairly common assessment among thirteenth-century\nlogicians. This in turn gives rise to the thought that perhaps\nAvicenna wasn't trying to produce a systematic syllogistic, that he\nhad other goals in mind as he dealt with material descended ultimately\nfrom Aristotle's Prior Analytics (some of it, from the\ncommentators, seemingly in conflict with what Aristotle is doing). If\nI understand correctly, this is broadly speaking how Hodges approaches\nAvicenna (see Hodges 2011b, 2012a, and 2012b in\n Other Internet Resources).\nOn the other hand, it may be that Avicenna has a complex system that\nrepays close analysis; Thom's studies of Avicenna's syllogistic\nproceed on that assumption. I tend to think the Thom approach is the\nmore promising. In any event, thirteenth-century logicians took\nAvicenna to have tried and failed to present a coherent system.\n\nIn this brief overview, I describe one aspect of Avicenna's\ntruth-conditions for modal propositions which became common doctrine\namong later Arabic logicians. I go on to examine some of what Avicenna\nsaid about the subject term of a proposition, and some of the\ninferences he defended. Avicenna's doctrines on both subject term and\nmodal inferences became much-debated issues in thirteenth-century\nlogic; I follow one line of the debate.\n2.3.1 Avicenna\n\nIn a famous and much-quoted passage, Avicenna lays out six conditions\nunder which a proposition may be said to have a given modalization\n(all his examples are of necessity propositions, but the same\nconditions apply to propositions under all modalizations); the first\ntwo conditions are the most important:\n\nText 16. Necessity may be absolute\n(\u2018al\u00e2 l-itl\u00e2q), as in God exists;\n[265] or it may be connected (mu\u2018allaqa) to a condition\n(shart).  The condition is either [1] perpetual [relative] to\nthe existence of the substance [of the subject] (dh\u00e2t),\nas in man is necessarily a rational body; by which we do not\nmean to say that man is and always will be a rational body, because\nthis is false taken for each human individual. Rather we mean that\nwhile he exists as a substance (m\u00e2 d\u00e2ma mawj\u00fbda\ndh-dh\u00e2t) as a human, he is a rational body.  Likewise for\nevery negative which resembles this affirmative statement. \nOr [the condition may be] [2] the duration (daw\u00e2m)\nof the subject's being described with what is set down with it, as in all\nmobile things are changing; this is not to be taken to mean [this\nis so] absolutely, nor while the subject exists as a substance, but\nrather while the substance of the moving thing is moving. [266]\n Distinguish between this condition and the first condition,\nbecause the first condition has set down [as the condition] the\nprinciple of the substance, man, whereas here the substance is set\ndown with a description which attaches to the substance, moving thing;\nthe moving thing has a substance and an essence (jawhar) to\nwhich movement and non-movement attach; but man and black are not like\nthat (Avicenna Ish\u00e2r\u00e2t [1971] 264\u2013266).\n\n\nAvicenna takes a proposition under condition [1]\u2014later\ntermed, for obvious reasons, the dh\u00e2t\u00ee\u2014to\nbe the right proposition to use while laying out the system Aristotle\nshould have laid out in the Prior Analytics, and for laying\nout the central claims of his own metaphysics. Avicenna focussed most\nof his attention on the dh\u00e2t\u00ee, and when he looked\nfor the strongest converse of a dh\u00e2t\u00ee\nproposition, he ignored wasf\u00ee converses. Later\nlogicians approached the issue of wasf\u00ee/dh\u00e2t\u00ee\nconditions differently, and often found wasf\u00ee converses\nfor dh\u00e2t\u00ee propositions; they had integrated the\ntwo readings in a way Avicenna had not.\nAvicenna stipulated for the subject term of all his\npropositions, whether explicitly modalized or not:\nText 17. Know that when we say every\nJ is B, we do not mean the totality (kulliyya)\nof J is the totality of B. Rather, we mean that\nevery single thing described as J, be it in mental\nsupposition or extramental existence, be it described as J\nalways, or sometimes, or whatever; that thing is described\nas B without further adding that it is so described at such\nand such a time (waqt), or in such and such circumstances\n(h\u00e2l), or perpetually. All of these [modalizations\nwould make for a proposition] stronger than one being described as\nabsolute (mutlaq). So this is what is understood\nfrom every J is B, with no addition of modal operators\nattached. On this understanding it is called a general\nabsolute\u2026 (Avicenna\n Ish\u00e2r\u00e2t [1971] 280 &\n282).\nThe phrase \u201cbe it in mental supposition\u201d might be taken\nto mean that the subject term is ampliated to the possible, so that\n\u201cevery J is B\u201d is to be taken as\n\u201cevery possible J is B.\u201d This is how\nFakhraddiin al-R\u00e2z\u00ee understood Avicenna (and two recent\nmodels for Avicenna's syllogistic ampliate the subject term; Thom\n2003, 2008b).\nAvicenna gave a number of accounts of modal propositions and\nsyllogisms. Here, I follow a few points made in the one given\nin Pointers and Reminders, the cynosure of thirteenth-century\nlogicians (though I also refer to Salvation which,\nlike Pointers, is available in English\ntranslation). Avicenna's syllogistic includes propositions without\nexplicit modalization (an absolute proposition, taken by Avicenna to\ncontain an elided temporal modality \u201cat least once\u201d, so the\na-proposition is understood as \u201cevery J is at least once B\u201d, the\ne-proposition as \u201cno J is always B\u201d) both one- and two-sided,\npossibility propositions both one-sided (\u201cevery J is possibly B\u201d) and\ntwo-sided, and necessity propositions (\u201cevery J is necessarily\nB\u201d,\u00a0 e-proposition \u201cno J is possibly B\u201d).\nEarly in his presentation, Avicenna considered whether the absolute\ne-proposition, \u201cno J is B\u201d, converts to\n\u201cno B is J\u201d (a conversion accepted by his\npredecessors and contemporaries). Avicenna rejected absolute\ne-conversion and offered a counter-example found in Aristotle,\n\u201cno horse is sleeping\u201d (Avicenna Naj\u00e2t [1985] 39), and\none of his own, \u201cno man is laughing\u201d (Avicenna\nIsh\u00e2r\u00e2t [1971] 322). He accepted that absolute a- and\ni-propositions convert:\n(1) \u201cEvery J is B\u201d and \u201csome J is\nB\u201d convert to \u201csome B is J.\u201d\n\nHe offered an ecthetic proof for the conversion (Avicenna\n Ish\u00e2r\u00e2t [1971] 330; Avicenna\nNaj\u00e2t  [1985] 44). And he proved the conversion of the\nnecessity e-proposition:\n(2) \u201cNo J is possibly B\u201d converts\nto \u201cno B is possibly J.\u201d\n\nText 18.  The universal negative\nnecessity proposition converts as itself, that is, as a universal\nnegative necessity. If necessarily no B is A, then\nnecessarily no A is B; were that not the case, then\npossibly a given A is B\u2014let that be J, such\nthat at a given moment what has become A will have become B, so\nthat it will be B and A, so that that B is an\nA; this is impossible. (Avicenna Naj\u00e2t [1985]\n44\u201345) \nAvicenna shifted on whether the necessity a- and i-propositions\nconvert to absolute i-propositions (Avicenna\nNaj\u00e2t [1985] 45), or to possibility i-propositions; his\nlater position is that they convert as possibility i-propositions\n(Avicenna  Ish\u00e2r\u00e2t [1971]\n335\u2013336).\n(3) \u201cEvery J is necessarily B\u201d\nand \u201csome J is necessarily B\u201d convert to\n\u201csome B is possibly J.\u201d\nAvicenna rejected the conversion of the possibility e-proposition\n(\u201cno J is necessarily B\u201d) with the same\ncounter-example used to reject absolute e-conversion (\u201cno man is\nnecessarily laughing\u201d). And he argued for the conversion of the\npossibility a- and i-propositions as i-propositions:\n(4) \u201cEvery J is possibly B\u201d\nand \u201csome J is possibly B\u201d convert to\n\u201csome B is possibly J.\u201d\nText 19.  If \u201cevery J is\npossibly B\u201d or \u201csome J is possibly\nB\u201d, then \u201csome B is possibly J\u201d\n(as a one-sided possibility proposition); were that not the case, then\nno B is possibly J, which as you know amounts to\n\u201cnecessarily no B is J\u201d, which converts to\n\u201cnecessarily no J is B\u201d; this is\nabsurd. (Avicenna Ish\u00e2r\u00e2t [1971]\n339ff.)\nNotice that the proof for necessity e-conversion depends on\npossibility i-conversion, and the proof for possibility i-conversion\non necessity e-conversion. Alternative proofs could be proposed; for\ne-conversion, for example, one could argue that \u201cno J is\npossibly B\u201d converts to \u201cno B is possibly\nJ\u201d, if not, then \u201csome B is possibly\nJ\u201d, but this with the first proposition produces by Ferio\n\u201csome J is not possibly J\u201d, which is\nabsurd. This proof is open to Avicenna, given that he took\nfirst-figure syllogisms with a possibility proposition as its minor\npremise to be perfect, or nearly so; this syllogistic mix was rejected\nby most later logicians, along with the other proofs.\n2.3.2 Post-Avicennan Logicians\nBy and large, logicians who came after Avicenna adopted many of his\nassumptions and distinctions: his understanding of the absolute\nproposition (at least with respect to the modalization of its\npredicate), the wasf\u00ee/dh\u00e2t\u00ee\ndistinction, the division of the syllogistic into repetitive and\nconnective. They worried, however, about a number of his claims\nconcerning modal propositions and the productive syllogisms that can\nbe built from them. By the middle of the thirteenth century, a primary\nconcern was about finding truth-conditions for propositions that could\nbe useful for the sciences (see Text 24 below),\nthough everyone started from Avicenna's formulations. A central\ndistinction in these later discussions was between externalist and\nessentialist readings of the propositions. This is what the terms\n\u201cexternalist\u201d and \u201cessentialist\u201d mean:\nText 20.  \u201cEvery J\nis B\u201d is considered at times according to the essence\n(whereupon it's called \u201cessentialist\u201d, as though [the\nsubject] is an essence in a proposition used in the sciences), and at\nother times according to external reality (whereupon it's called\n\u201cexternalist\u201d, and what is meant by \u201cexternal\u201d\nis what is external to the senses).  (Taht\u00e2n\u00ee\n1948: Tahr\u00eer 94.6\u20138)\nFakhradd\u00een al-R\u00e2z\u00ee was the first to introduce the\ndistinction between externalist and essentialist readings (see notes\nto R\u00e2z\u00ee 2002: at 400). When we say \u201cevery J\nis B\u201d,\nText 21.  \u2026we don't mean by it\nwhat is described as J externally, but rather something more\ngeneral, which is: were it to exist externally it would be true of it\nthat it is J, whether it exists externally or not. For we can say\n\u201cevery triangle is a figure\u201d even if there are no\ntriangles existent externally. The meaning is rather that everything\nwhich would be a triangle were it to exist would be\u2014in so far as\nit existed\u2014a figure. (R\u00e2z\u00ee Mulakhkhas\n[2002] 141.6\u201310)\n[\u2026]\nBy the second reading, we mean by \u201cevery J\u201d\nevery single thing which exists externally among the\nindividual Js\u2026 On this hypothesis, were there no\nseptagons existent externally, it wouldn't be correct to say\n\u201cevery septagon is a figure\u201d; if the only figures existent\nexternally were triangles, it would be correct to say \u201cevery\nfigure is a triangle.\u201d On the first reading, both of these would\nbe false. (R\u00e2z\u00ee Mulakhkhas [2002]\n142.13\u2013143.1)\n\nR\u00e2z\u00ee went on to investigate inferences in both\nreadings,\nand found the inferences from propositions with essentialist readings\nlined up closely with Avicenna's. The readings gave R\u00e2z\u00ee\nall the conversions mentioned in \nsection 2.3.1 above except 1 (he took\nthe absolute\naffirmative to convert as a possibility proposition). He also accepted\nsyllogisms with possibility propositions as minor premises to be\nproductive. Interpretive considerations may have been at play in his\nclear preference for the essentialist reading, but what explicitly\nmotivated the distinction is the need to have propositions refer to\nthings which do not exist \u201cexternally\u201d; the examples are always of\nnon-instantiated geometric figures.\nR\u00e2z\u00ee was clear that he did not intend the essentialist\nreading to amount to an ampliation of the subject term to the possible\nsuch as he attributed to Alfarabi (\u201cAlfarabi claimed that with\nrespect to \u2018every J\u2019 one shouldn't [only] take\naccount of actually occurring Js, but everything whose\ndescription as J is possible\u201d; R\u00e2z\u00ee\nMulakhkhas [2002] 142.4\u20135).  But with the phrase\n\u201cwere it to exist externally it would be true of it that it is\nJ\u201d, R\u00e2z\u00ee posited a domain of discourse\nincluding non-instantiated Js, and he seemed to take his\npropositions thereby to refer to possible-Js.\nThat at least is how Kh\u00fbnaj\u00ee understood\nR\u00e2z\u00ee's solution; he took it to amount to no more than an\nampliation of the subject term to the possible. Unlike\nR\u00e2z\u00ee, Kh\u00fbnaj\u00ee understood the phrase\n\u201cwere it to exist as a J\u201d to include reference to\nimpossible Js, and modified or rejected the conversions 1, 2, 3\nand 4.  Before turning to how Kh\u00fbnaj\u00ee used the\nessentialist reading, consider his assessment of R\u00e2z\u00ee's\nreading at the end of the chapter on conversion in\nDisclosure.\nText 22. Know\nthat these valuations relating to conversion which we have mentioned\ndon't differ much from the claims of the ancients, even though they\nmay differ from what some recent logicians have said. Were we to be\nsatisfied, as Alfarabi was, that for something to be a subject the\npossibility [of its coming under the subject term would be enough],\nand not consider [the subject term's] affirmation of it in actuality,\nit would follow that the [universal] negative necessity proposition\nwould convert as a necessity proposition, affirmative possibility\npropositions would convert as a possibility proposition, the\nconversion of absolute propositions wouldn't result in more than\npossibility, and the syllogism in the first figure with a minor\npossibility proposition would be productive, as will be clear to you\nafter coming to know what has gone before, and having given due\nconsideration to the propositions under this technical usage. Since\nthe later scholars have changed the technical usage without changing\nthe valuations they arrive at\u2014such that the valuation differs\naccordingly to the difference in technical usage\u2014, they have\nbeen mired in nonsense. Perhaps Avicenna hesitated over the conversion\nof absolute propositions as either possibility or absolute\npropositions just because of his hesitation over technical usage. When\nhe says that they convert as possibility propositions, he doesn't\nconsider affirmation in actuality with respect to the subject; when he\nsays they convert as absolute propositions, he does (because the fact\nthe absolute follows on this technical usage is just about patently\nevident, such that it wouldn't be appropriate for Avicenna to deny\nit).  (Kh\u00fbnaj\u00ee Kashf [2010]\n145.3-u)\nHaving rejected R\u00e2z\u00ee's understanding of the\nessentialist reading, Kh\u00fbnaj\u00ee deployed his own modified\nessentialist reading to come to different inferences. Take absolute\ne-conversion, which Avicenna and R\u00e2z\u00ee agreed fails\n(according to R\u00e2z\u00ee, it fails on either externalist or\nessentialist reading). Kh\u00fbnaj\u00ee agreed that it fails on the\nexternalist reading (which he took in the same way R\u00e2z\u00ee\ndid). Taken in Kh\u00fbnaj\u00ee's essentialist reading, however,\n\u201cno J is always B\u201d converts as a perpetuity\no-proposition, \u201csome B is never J.\u201d To show\nthis is so, Kh\u00fbnaj\u00ee had to offer a proof for the\nconversion, then resist counter-examples to it. I skip the proof, and\ngo straight to how Kh\u00fbnaj\u00ee dealt with the\ncounter-examples.\n\n\nText 23. They argue\nconversion fails for these propositions because it is true, \u201cno\nmoon is eclipsed\u201d\u2026and \u201cno animal is\nbreathing\u201d\u2026 yet [130] their converses are not true,\nnamely, \u201csome eclipsed is not a moon\u201d, and \u201csome\nbreathing is not animal\u201d\u2026\nThe answer to this is that we reject that \u201csome eclipsed is\nnot a moon\u201d and similar statements are false if the subject is\ntaken according to the essentialist reading. This is because, in this\ncase, its meaning is some of what would be eclipsed, were it to come\nto exist, would not be a moon, insofar as it had come to exist. [The\nclaim this is false] is to be rejected; the most that can be said in\nthis matter is that every eclipsed that has come to exist is a moon,\nbut from this is does not follow that it is true that everything that\nis eclipsed, were it to come to exist, would be a moon insofar as it\ncomes to exist. This is because [the proposition with an essentialist\nsubject] deals with actual, possible and impossible items [that come\nunder the subject term]. Were we to stipulate the possibility [of\nthese items] along with [the other stipulations], their status would\nbe that of externally existent things. So the\neclipsed-which-is-not-a-moon, even though it is impossible, is among\nthose individuals which would be eclipsed, were they to come to exist,\neven though it is not necessary that any would be a moon if they came\nto exist.\nOverall, if these propositions\nare taken\nin the essentialist reading, the proof we have given for their\nconversion works, the counter-arguments are not compelling, and the\nproper view must be that the conversion is correct.\n(Kh\u00fbnaj\u00ee Kashf [2010] 129.14\u2013130.12)\n\nWhat this means for the counter-example considered before, \u201cno man\nis always laughing\u201d, is that it converts on this account to \u201csome\nlaughing is not ever a man.\u201d This is because we may, under\nKh\u00fbnaj\u00ee's essentialist reading, posit the impossible\n\u201claughing-which-is-not-a-man.\u201d With this modified essentialist\nreading, Kh\u00fbnaj\u00ee ended up with the following\nconversions:\n\n\n(1*) \u201cEvery J is at least once\nB\u201d converts as \u201csome B is necessarily\nJ\u201d (Kh\u00fbnaj\u00ee Kashf [2010] 143);\n(2*) \u201cNo J is possibly B\u201d\nconverts as \u201cno B is ever J\u201d\n(Kh\u00fbnaj\u00ee Kashf [2010] 135);\n(3*) \u201cEvery J is necessarily B\u201d\nconverts as \u201csome B is necessarily J\u201d\n(Kh\u00fbnaj\u00ee Kashf [2010] 143);\n(4*) \u201cEvery J is possibly B\u201d has\nno provable converse (Kh\u00fbnaj\u00ee Kashf [2010]\n144).\n\n\nThe Maragha logicians\u2014whose work included the compositions\non logic\nmost frequently taught in the Islamic world\u2014reflected critically on\nAvicenna, R\u00e2z\u00ee and Kh\u00fbnaj\u00ee. Everyone accepted\nthat there were problems with Avicenna's inferences, but also that\nKh\u00fbnaj\u00ee's critique of R\u00e2z\u00ee's essentialist\nreading (which had saved most of Avicenna's inferences) was correct.\nKh\u00fbnaj\u00ee's alternative development of the essentialist\nreading led to its own problems, however; first Abar\u00ee proved that\nan e-proposition couldn't be true on Kh\u00fbnaj\u00ee's version of\nthis reading, then T\u00fbs\u00ee proved, nor could an a-proposition.\nBy the time K\u00e2tib\u00ee came to deal with the problem, he took\nKh\u00fbnaj\u00ee's comment in Text 23 above seriously: \n\u2026the proposition with an\nessentialist subject] deals with actual,\npossible and impossible items [that come under the subject term]. Were\nwe to stipulate the possibility [of these items] along with [the\nother stipulations], their status would be that of externally existent\nthings.\nK\u00e2tib\u00ee further modified Kh\u00fbnaj\u00ee's\nreading to\nlimit propositions with essentialist subjects to those with\nself-consistent subjects. In the Shamsiyya,\nin consequence, the externalist and essentialist readings are taken to\nbe of the same status, which is to say, all and only the inferences\nprovable in one reading are provable in the other. On the conversions\nin question, K\u00e2tib\u00ee held: \n\n\n\n(1)\n \u201cEvery J is at least once B\u201d\nconverts as \u201csome B is at least once J\u201d; \n\n\n(2*)\n \u201cNo J is possibly B\u201d converts\nas \u201cno B is ever J\u201d;\n\n\n(3**)\n \u201cEvery J is necessarily B\u201d converts as\n\u201csome B is at least once J\nwhile B\u201d;\n\n\n(4*)\n \u201cEvery J is possibly B\u201d has\nno provable converse.\n\n\n\nTaht\u00e2n\u00ee, writing in the early fourteenth century,\nlooked back over the efforts of his thirteenth-century predecessors\nand summed up the nature of their inquiries. If his account is\ncorrect, the thirteenth-century logicians limited their investigations\nto scientifically useful propositions, acknowledging at the same time\nthat there are many other propositions with different truth-conditions\nthey could be investigating.\nText 24. It is\nnot to be leveled as a criticism that, because the craft should have\ngeneral rules, there are propositions that cannot be taken under\neither of these two considerations (namely, those whose subjects are\nimpossible, as in \u201cthe co-creator is impossible\u201d, and\n\u201cevery impossible is non-existent\u201d).  Because we say: No\none claims to limit all propositions to the essentialist and the\nexternalist. They do however claim that propositions used in the\nsciences are used for the most part under one of these two\nconsiderations, so they therefore set these readings down and extract\ntheir qualifications so they may thereby benefit in the sciences. The\nqualifications of the propositions that cannot be taken under either\nof these two considerations are not yet known; the generalization of\nrules is only to the extent of human capacity.
