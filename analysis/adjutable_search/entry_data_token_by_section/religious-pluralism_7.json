Religious Diversity in Public Education\n\nPublic education in Western culture has always been to some extent a\n\u201cmelting pot.\u201d[10] But the increasing number of students with\nnon-Western cultural values and religious traditions is causing public\nschool educators to grapple in new and sometimes uncomfortable ways\nwith the challenges such diversity poses. Some of these challenges are\npractical\u2014e.g., should Muslim girls be allowed to wear hijabs,\nshould schools designate only Christian religious holy days as school\nholidays? The focus of this section, however, will be a pedagogical\nquestion of increasing interest in the philosophy of education: How\nought the increasing religious diversity to which students are exposed\naffect public school curricula?\n\nMost public school educators agree that increasing student\nunderstanding of diverse religious perspectives is important as this\nwill have positive social outcomes. It is often argued, for instance,\nthat helping students better understand the increasing diversity,\nincluding religious diversity, they face will better prepare them to\nlive in a peaceful, productive manner with those with differing\ncultural and/or religious values (Kunzman 2006).\n\nMany educators, however, want to go further. It is also important,\nthey maintain, for students to clarify their feelings about other\nreligions and their followers. Specifically, they want to foster a\nmore empathetic understanding of other religious perspectives, an\nunderstanding that encourages students to appreciate the other\nreligions from the perspective of an adherent of that religion\n(Kunzman 2006). While few challenge this as a valid goal, there is,\nthough, continuing controversy over one common method by which\neducators attempt to engender this type of empathy in students. As\nsome see it, while having students think about diverse religions is an\nimportant step past the mere dissemination of factual information\ntoward empathetic understanding, having students directly experience\nthese religions in some way\u2014for instance, having students visit\na local mosque or having a representative from a Hindu Temple share\nwith students in a class\u2014is also necessary (or at least very\ndesirable). Not surprisingly, though, while no one denies that these\nforms of direct experience might broaden a student\u2019s empathetic\nunderstanding of a religion, concerns have been raised.\n\nFirst, some believe that having students experience a religion, even\nas \u201cobservers,\u201d can test the limits of the separation of church\nand state. While the intent of having students attend a mosque or\nhaving a Buddhist talk with students is seldom to \u201cpromote\u201d a\nreligion, the line between \u201cexposure\u201d and intended or unintended\npromotion (and even proselytization), they maintain, is a fine one.\nThis is especially the case given the widely varying communication\nskills and deeply embedded values and preconceptions of the teacher\nand/or the representatives of a given religion to whom students might\nbe exposed. Second, there is growing ethical concern that to\nexperience a religion as an observer might in some cases trivialize or\ndemean the religion in question. Some Native Americans, for instance,\nare becoming increasingly concerned with the growing desire of\n\u201coutsiders\u201d to seek understanding of their religion(s) by watching\nor experiencing sacred ceremonies since such observation, they\nbelieve, can trivialize these ceremonies (Kasprisin 2003: 422).\n\nIs it justifiable for the public school educator to go even further\nthan the dissemination of accurate information and the attempted\nengendering of empathetic understanding? Specifically, ought an\neducator attempt to bring it about that all students affirm a core set\nof \u201cappropriate\u201d beliefs about other religions and their\nadherents?\n\nIt is clearly the case that almost all public school educators\ncurrently do attempt to bring it about that students hold certain\nbeliefs related to pervasive human characteristics, such as race,\ngender, and disabling conditions. Students are encouraged, for\ninstance, to continue to believe, or come to believe, that engaging in\nintolerant or discriminatory behavior is wrong and that they should\naffirm, or come to affirm, the inherent worth and rights of the\ndisabled, those of other racial/ethnic backgrounds, etc. So if the\ndesire is simply to also encourage students to believe it wrong to\ntreat those of other religions in intolerant or discriminatory ways\nand to believe it right to accept those of other religions as persons\nwith equal inherent value, few will object.\n\nHowever, need teachers stop there? Might there not be other beliefs\nabout religions and their adherents that public school educators can\njustifiably attempt to bring it about that all students accept? We can\nextrapolate from some work on religious diversity by Robert Wuthnow to\nintroduce two beliefs that some might propose fit into this category.\nAs Wuthnow sees it, the most appropriate response to the increasing\nreligious diversity we face in the United States is what he labels\n\u201creflective pluralism\u201d (Wuthnow 2005: 286\u2013307). To engage\nin this sort of reflection, he tells us, is not simply to become\nbetter informed, or to strive to \u201clive peacefully with those with\nwhom one disagrees\u201d (be tolerant), or even to attempt to develop an\nempathetic understanding of diverse religions. It is to engage\nintentionally and purposefully with \u201cpeople and groups whose\nreligious practices are fundamentally different from one\u2019s own\u201d\n(Wuthnow 2005: 289). And such engagement, as he understands it,\nincludes both (1) the recognition that since all of our beliefs,\nincluding our religious beliefs, depend on a point of view \u201cshaped\nby the culture in which we live,\u201d we should not regard our \u201cown\nposition[s] as inherently superior\u201d and (2) \u201ca principled\nwillingness to compromise\u201d in the sense that we must be willing to\nmove out of our social and emotional comfort levels \u201cin order to\narrive at a workable relationship with another person\u201d (Wuthnow\n2005: 292).\n\nThe benefit of this form of engagement, we are told, is not only that\nit can minimize the likelihood of the sorts of \u201creligious\ntensions, conflicts, and violence [that] have been so much a part of\nhuman history\u201d (Wuthnow 2005: 293). Such reflective engagement\nalso allows us to focus on \u201cthe shared concerns for basic human\ndignity\u201d found in the teachings of many of the world\u2019s\nreligions, which can furnish a basis for inter-religious cooperation\nto combat social ills and meet basic social needs (Wuthnow 2005:\n294).\n\nIt is important to note that Wuthnow does not explicitly claim or deny\nthat encouraging students in a public school setting to become\nreflective pluralists would be appropriate. But not only does he\nhighlight two increasingly popular pluralistic claims about\nreligions\u2014(1) that the beliefs of many religions are equally\nvalid expressions of faith, expressions that adherents of these\nreligions should be allowed or even encouraged to maintain and (2)\nthat religious believers of all faiths should identify and focus on\nwhat these religions have in common\u2014he highlights what such\npluralists often note as the main benefits of widespread affirmation\nof these beliefs: a reduction in violent religious conflicts and an\nincrease in socially beneficial inter-religious cooperation. And these\noutcomes are clearly quite compatible with what we have seen to be a\nkey reason why public school educators want to increase student\nunderstanding of other religions\u2014namely, their desire to better\nprepare students to live in a peaceful, productive manner in social\ncontexts that will increasingly be characterized by religious\ndiversity. Accordingly, since it seems reasonable to believe that\nwidespread acceptance of the validity of diverse religious\nperspectives and increased focus on the commonalities in diverse\nreligions might well result in more peaceful, mutually beneficial\ninteraction among followers of diverse religions, the question of\nwhether public school teachers can justifiably attempt to bring it\nabout that students affirm the beliefs in question appears worthy of\nexploration.\n\nLet\u2019s first consider the contention that many religions contain\nequally valid expressions of faith. Even if we make the debatable\nassumption that this is true, it won\u2019t be clear to many that public\nschool teachers could justifiably attempt to bring it about that their\nstudents believed this to be so. The problem is that various religions\naffirm conflicting doctrinal beliefs on significant issues. For\nexample, while conservative Christians maintain that one must affirm\ncertain beliefs about the saving power of Christ to spend eternity in\nGod\u2019s presence, conservative Muslims strongly deny this. Orthodox\nChristians and Muslims are taught not only that the sacred scriptures\nof other religions contain false beliefs; they are often encouraged to\ntry to convert those of other religions to their religious\nperspective. And while many Muslims and Christians believe in a\npersonal supernatural creator and personally immortality, some\nBuddhists deny both. This, however, means that an educator can\njustifiably attempt to convince students that all religions are\nequally valid expressions of faith only if she or he can justifiably\nattempt to convince conservative proponents of some of these religions\nthat some of their core doctrinal beliefs need to be modified or\nrejected. To attempt to do this in a public school setting will be\nseen by many as violating the prohibition against both restricting the\nfree exercise of religion and promoting a given religion (Basinger\n2010)\n\nMight it not, though, at least be justifiable for a public school\neducator to encourage students to respect the right of adherents to\nother religions to retain their current religious beliefs? If we\ninterpret this as asking whether an educator can justifiably encourage\nstudents not to attempt to prohibit adherents to other religions from\nexpressing and acting in accordance with their beliefs, a positive\nresponse is noncontroversial since this is only to say once again that\neducators should encourage students to be tolerant. However, to\nencourage respect for the religious beliefs of others often carries\nwith it the explicit or implicit assumption that it is inappropriate,\nif not unethical, to attempt to convince adherents of one religion to\nconvert to another. And for a public school educator to attempt to\nconvince all students that it is wrong to proselytize will again be\nseen by some as placing this educator in the legally and morally\nquestionable position of attempting to convince some students to\nreject or modify what for them is a very fundamental, core religious\nbelief.\n\nPerhaps, however, there is a different, less controversial option for\nthose educators who want to do more than simply encourage tolerance of\nexpression and empathetic understanding. Is it not at least\njustifiable for the public school teacher to attempt to point out the\nimportant common values affirmed by most of the world\u2019s major\nreligions, values that we can all accept and should all desire to see\nlived out? Is it not justifiable for an educator to point out, for\ninstance, that most of the world\u2019s major religions prohibit such\nthings as killing, lying, stealing, dehumanizing racism, and sexual\nexploitation, and that these same religions encourage such things as\nhelping those in need and treating adherents of other religions with\nrespect. To do so, it has been argued, would not simply be of value\nwithin the classroom or community. Since religious convictions clearly\ninfluence social, political, and economic activity on a global scale,\nemphasizing the shared common values of religions has the potential to\nfacilitate better global relationships. And to encourage such\nrelationships is surely an appropriate goal of public education\n(Shingleton 2008).\n\nSome, of course, will see any focus on \u201cpositive\ncommonalities\u201d as yet another thinly veiled attempt to encourage\nstudents to modify their current religious beliefs in ways that make\nsuch beliefs more accommodating of other religious perspectives.\nHowever, most see no legal or ethical reason why a teacher should not\nexpose students to the \u201cpositive commonalities\u201d in diverse\nreligious perspectives, and many see this as a helpful step.\n",
