    "main_text": "Vagueness || Argument from Meaning\n7.3 Argument from Meaning\n\nThe final argument is not set out as clearly, but it has perhaps the\nmost persuasive force. Unger says that if exactly one of the\noi is a cloud, then there must be a\n\u2018selection principle\u2019 that picks it over the others. But\nit is not clear just what kind of selection principle that could be.\nThe underlying argument seems to be something like this:\n\n\nM1.\nFor some j, oj is a cloud.\nM2.\nIf oj is a cloud and the rest of the\noi are not, then some principle selects\noj to be the unique cloud.\nM3.\nThere is no principle that selects oj to be\nthe unique cloud.\nC.\nAt least one of the other oi is a cloud.\n\n\n\nThe idea behind M2 is that word meanings are not brute facts about\nreality. As Jerry Fodor put it, \u201cif aboutness is real, it must\nbe really something else\u201d (Fodor 1987: 97). Something makes it\nthe case that oj is the unique thing (around here)\nthat satisfies our term \u2018heap\u2019. Maybe that could be\nbecause oj has some unique properties that make it\nsuitable to be in the denotation of ordinary terms. Or maybe it is\nsomething about our linguistic practices. Or maybe it is some\ncombination of these things. But something must determine it, and\nwhatever it is, we can (in theory) say what that is, by giving some\nkind of principled explanation of why oj is the\nunique cloud.\n\nIt is at this point that theories of\n vagueness\n can play a role in the debate. Two of the leading theories of\nvagueness, epistemicism and supervaluationism, provide principled\nreasons to reject this argument. The epistemicist says that there are\nsemantic facts that are beyond our possible knowledge. Arguably we can\nonly know where a semantic boundary lies if that boundary was fixed by\nour use or by the fact that one particular property is a natural kind.\nBut, say the epistemicists, there are many other boundaries that are\nnot like this, such as the boundary between the heaps and the\nnon-heaps. Here we have a similar kind of situation. It is vague just\nwhich of the oi is a cloud. What that means is\nthat there is a fact about which of them is a cloud, but we cannot\npossibly know it. The epistemicist is naturally read as rejecting the\nvery last step in the previous paragraph. Even if something (probably\nour linguistic practices) makes it the case that\noj is the unique cloud, that need not be something\nwe can know and state.\n\nThe supervaluationist response is worth spending more time on here,\nboth because it engages directly with the intuitions behind this\nargument and because two of its leading proponents (Vann McGee and\nBrian McLaughlin, in their 2001) have responded directly to this\nargument using the supervaluationist framework. Roughly (and for more\ndetail see the section on supervaluations in the entry on\n vagueness)\n supervaluationists say that whenever some terms are vague, there are\nways of making them more precise consistent with our intuitions on how\nthe terms behave. So, to use a classic case, \u2018heap\u2019 is\nvague, which to the supervaluationist means that there are some piles\nof sand that are neither determinately heaps nor determinately\nnon-heaps, and a sentence saying that that object is a heap is neither\ndeterminately true nor determinately false. However, there are many\nways to extend the meaning of \u2018heap\u2019 so it\nbecomes precise. Each of these ways of making it precise is called a\nprecisification. A precisification is admissible iff\nevery sentence that is determinately true (false) in English is true\n(false) in the precisification. So if a is determinately a\nheap, b is determinately not a heap and c is neither\ndeterminately a heap nor determinately not a heap, then every\nprecisification must make \u2018a is a heap\u2019 true and\n\u2018b is a heap\u2019 false, but some make\n\u2018c is a heap\u2019 true and others make it false. To a\nfirst approximation, to be admissible a precisification must assign\nall the determinate heaps to the extension of \u2018heap\u2019 and\nassign none of the determinate non-heaps to its extension, but it is\nfree to assign or not assign things in the \u2018penumbra\u2019\nbetween these groups to the extension of \u2018heap\u2019. But this\nis not quite right. If d is a little larger than c,\nbut still not determinately a heap, then the sentence \u201cIf\nc is a heap so is d\u201d is intuitively true. As\nit is often put, following Kit Fine (1975), a precisification must\nrespect \u2018penumbral connections\u2019 between the borderline\ncases. If d has a better case for being a heap than\nc, then a precisification cannot make c a heap but\nnot d. These penumbral connections play a crucial role in the\nsupervaluationist solution to the Problem of the Many. Finally, a\nsentence is determinately true iff it is true on all admissible\nprecisifications, determinately false iff it is false on all\nadmissible precisifications.\n\nIn the original example, described by Lewis, the sentence \u201cThere\nis one cloud in the sky\u201d is determinately true. None of the\nsentences \u201co1 is a cloud\u201d,\n\u201co2 is a cloud\u201d and so on are\ndeterminately true. So a precisification can make each of these either\ntrue or false. But, if it is to preserve the fact that \u201cThere is\none cloud in the sky\u201d is determinately true, it must make\nexactly one of those sentences true. McGee and McLaughlin\nsuggest that this combination of constraints lets us preserve what is\nplausible about M2, without accepting that it is true. The term\n\u2018cloud\u2019 is vague; there is no fact of the matter as to\nwhether its extension includes o1 or\no2 or o3 or \u2026. If there\nwere such a fact, there would have to be something that made it the\ncase that it included oj and not\nok, and as M3 correctly points out, no such facts\nexist. But this is consistent with saying that its extension does\ncontain exactly one of the oi. The beauty of the\nsupervaluationist solution is that it lets us hold these seemingly\ncontradictory positions simultaneously. We also get to capture some of\nthe plausibility of S2\u2014it is consistent with the\nsupervaluationist position to say that anything similar to a cloud is\nnot determinately not a cloud.\n\nPenumbral connections also let us explain some other puzzling\nsituations. Imagine I point cloudwards and say, \u201cThat is a\ncloud.\u201d Intuitively, what I have said is true, even though\n\u2018cloud\u2019 is vague, and so is my demonstrative\n\u2018that\u2019. (To see this, note that there\u2019s no\ndeterminate answer as to which of the oi it picks\nout.) On different precisifications, \u2018that\u2019 picks out\ndifferent oi. But on every precisification it\npicks out the oi that is in the extension of\n\u2018cloud\u2019, so \u201cThat is a cloud\u201d comes out true\nas desired. Similarly, if I named the cloud \u2018Edgar\u2019, then\na similar trick lets it be true that \u201cEdgar\u201d is vague,\nwhile \u201cEdgar is a cloud\u201d is determinately true. So the\nsupervaluationist solution lets us preserve many of the intuitions\nabout the original case, including the intuitions that seemed to\nunderwrite M2, without conceding that there are millions of clouds.\nBut there are a few objections to this package.\n\nObjection: There are many telling objections to\nsupervaluationist theories of vagueness.\n\n\n\n\nReply: This may be true, but it would take us well beyond the\nscope of this entry to outline them all. See the entries on\n vagueness\n (the section on supervaluation) and the\n Sorites Paradox\n for more detail. \n \nObjection: The supervaluationist solution makes some\nexistentially quantified sentences, like \u201cThere is a cloud in\nthe sky\u201d determinately true even though no instance of them is\ndeterminately true.\n\n\n\n\nReply: As Lewis says, this is odd, but no odder than things\nthat we learn to live with in other contexts. Lewis compares this to\n\u201cI owe you a horse, but there is no particular horse that I owe\nyou.\u201d \n \nObjection: The penumbral connections here are not\nprecisely specified. What is the rule that says how much overlap is\nrequired before two objects cannot both be clouds?\n\n\n\n\nReply: It is true that the connections are not precisely\nspecified. It would be quite hard to carefully analyze\n\u2018cloud\u2019 to work out exactly what they are. But that we\ncannot say exactly what the rules are is no reason for saying no such\nrules exist, any more than our inability to say exactly what knowledge\nis provides a reason for saying that no one ever knows anything.\nScepticism can\u2019t be proven that easily. \n \nObjection: The penumbral connections appealed to here are\nleft unexplained. At a crucial stage in the explanation, it seems to\nbe just assumed that the problem can be solved, and that it is a\ndeterminate truth that there is one cloud in the sky.\n\n\n\n\nReply 1: We have to start somewhere in philosophy. This kind\nof reply can be spelled out in two ways. There is a\n\u2018Moorean\u2019 move that says that the premise that there is\none cloud in the sky is more plausible than the premises that would\nhave to be used in an argument against supervaluationism.\nAlternatively, it might be claimed that the main argument for\nsupervaluationism is an inference to the best explanation. In that\ncase, the intuition that there is exactly one cloud in the sky, but it\nis indeterminate just which object it is, is something to be\nexplained, not something that has to be proven. This is the\nkind of position defended by Rosanna Keefe in her book Theories of\nVagueness. Although Keefe does not apply this directly\nto the Problem of the Many, the way to apply her position to the\nProblem seems clear enough. \n\n\nReply 2: The penumbral connections we find for most words are\ngenerated by the inferential role provided by the meaning of the\nterms. It is because the inference from \u201cThis pile of sand is a\nheap\u201d, and \u201cThat pile of sand is slightly larger than this\none, and arranged roughly the same way,\u201d to \u201cThat pile of\nsand is a heap\u201d is generally acceptable that precisifications\nwhich make the premises true and the conclusions false are\ninadmissible. (We have to restrict this inferential rule to the case\nwhere \u2018this\u2019 and \u2018that\u2019 are ordinary\ndemonstratives, and not used to pick out arbitrary fusions of grains,\nor else we get bizarre results for reasons that should be familiar by\nthis point in the story.) And it isn\u2019t too hard to specify the\ninferential rule here. The inference from\n\u201coj is a cloud\u201d and\n\u201coj and ok massively\noverlap\u201d to \u201cok is a cloud\u201d is\njust as acceptable as the above inference involving heaps. Indeed, it\nis part of the meaning of \u2018cloud\u2019 that this inference is\nacceptable. (Much of this reply is drawn from the discussion of\n\u2018maximal\u2019 predicates in Sider 2001 and 2003, though since\nSider is no supervaluationist, he would not entirely endorse this way\nof putting things.) \n \nObjection: The second reply cannot explain the existence\nof penumbral connections between \u2018cloud\u2019 and\ndemonstratives like \u2018that\u2019 and names like\n\u2018Edgar\u2019. It would only explain the existence of those\npenumbral connections if it was part of the meaning of names and\ndemonstratives that they fill some kind of inferential role. But this\nis inconsistent with the widely held view that demonstratives and\nnames are\n directly referential.\n (For more details on debates about the meanings of names, see the\nentries on\n propositional attitude reports\n and\n singular propositions.)\n \n\n\n\nReply: One response to this would be to deny the view that\nnames and demonstratives are directly referential. Another would be to\ndeny that inferential roles provide the only penumbral\nconstraints on precisifications. Weatherson 2003b sketches a theory\nthat does exactly this. The theory draws on David Lewis\u2019s\nresponse to some quite different work on semantic indeterminacy. As\nmany authors (Quine 1960, Putnam 1981, Kripke 1982) showed, the\ndispositions of speakers to use terms are not fine-grained enough to\nmake the language as precise as we ordinarily think it is. As far as\nour usage dispositions go, \u2018rabbit\u2019 could mean undetached\nrabbit part, \u2018vat\u2019 could mean vat image, and\n\u2018plus\u2019 could mean quus. (Quus is a function defined over\npairs of numbers that yields the sum of the two numbers when they are\nboth small, and 5 when one is sufficiently large.) But intuitively our\nlanguage is not that indeterminate: \u2018plus\u2019 determinately\ndoes not mean quus.\n\nLewis (1983, 1984) suggested the way out here is to posit a notion of\n\u2018naturalness\u2019. Sometimes a term t denotes the\nconcept C1 rather than C2 not\nbecause we are disposed to use t as if it meant\nC1 rather than C2, but simply\nbecause C1 is a more natural concept.\n\u2018Plus\u2019 means plus rather than quus simply because plus is\nmore natural than quus. Something like the same story applies to names\nand demonstratives. Imagine I point in the direction of Tibbles the\ncat and say, \u201cThat is Edgar\u2019s favourite cat.\u201d There\nis a way of systematically (mis)interpreting all my utterances so\n\u2018that\u2019 denotes the Tibbles-shaped region of space-time\nexactly one metre behind Tibbles. (We have to reinterpret what\n\u2018cat\u2019 means to make this work, but the discussions of\nsemantic indeterminacy in Quine and Kripke make it clear how to do\nthis.) So there\u2019s nothing in my usage dispositions that makes\n\u2018that\u2019 mean Tibbles, rather than the region of space-time\nthat \u2018follows\u2019 him around. But because Tibbles is more\nnatural than that region of space-time, \u2018that\u2019 does pick\nout Tibbles. It is the very same naturalness that makes\n\u2018cat\u2019 denote a property that Tibbles (and not the trailing\nregion of space-time) satisfies that makes \u2018that\u2019 denote\nTibbles, a fact that will become important below.\n\nThe same kind of story can be applied to the cloud. It is because the\ncloud is a more natural object than the region of space-time a mile\nabove the cloud that our demonstrative \u2018that\u2019 denotes the\ncloud and not the region. However, none of the oi\nare more natural than any other, so there is still no fact of the\nmatter as to whether \u2018that\u2019 picks out\noj or ok. Lewis\u2019s theory\ndoes not eliminate all semantic indeterminacy; when there are equally\nnatural candidates to be the denotation of a term, and each of them is\nconsistent with our dispositions to use the term, then the denotation\nof the term is simply indeterminate between those candidates.\n\nWeatherson\u2019s theory is that the role of each precisification is\nto arbitrarily make one of the oi more natural\nthan the rest. Typically, it is thought that the denotation of a term\naccording to a precisification is determined directly. It is a fact\nabout a precisification P that, according to it,\n\u2018cloud\u2019 denotes property c1. On\nWeatherson\u2019s theory this is not the case. What the\nprecisification does is provide a new, and somewhat arbitrary,\nstandard of naturalness, and the content of the terms according to the\nprecisification is then determined by Lewis\u2019s theory of content.\nThe denotations of \u2018cloud\u2019 and \u2018that\u2019\naccording to a precisification P are those concepts and\nobjects that are the most natural-according-to-P of the\nconcepts and objects that we could be denoting by those terms, for all\none can tell from the way the terms are used. The coordination between\nthe two terms, the fact that on every precisification\n\u2018that\u2019 denotes an object in the extension of\n\u2018cloud\u2019 is explained by the fact that the very same thing,\nnaturalness-according-to-P, determines the denotation of\n\u2018cloud\u2019 and of \u2018that\u2019. \n \nObjection (From Stephen Schiffer 1998): The\nsupervaluationist account cannot handle speech reports involving vague\nnames. Imagine that Alex points cloudwards and says, \u201cThat is a\ncloud.\u201d Later Sam points towards the same cloud and says,\n\u201cAlex said that that is a cloud.\u201d Intuitively, Sam\u2019s\nutterance is determinately true. But according to the\nsupervaluationist, it is only determinately true if it is true on\nevery precisification. So it must be true that Alex said that\no1 is a cloud, that Alex said that\no2 is a cloud, and so on, since these are all\nprecisifications of \u201cAlex said that that is a cloud.\u201d But\nAlex did not say all of those things, for if she did she would be\ncommitted to saying that there are millions of clouds in the sky, and\nof course she is not, as the supervaluationists have been arguing.\n\n\n\n\nReply: There is a little logical slip here. Let\nPi be a precisification of Sam\u2019s word\n\u2018that\u2019 that makes it denote oi. All\nthe supervaluationist who holds that Sam\u2019s utterance is\ndeterminately true is committed to is that for each i,\naccording to Pi, Alex said that\noi is a cloud. And this will be true if the\ndenotation of Alex\u2019s word \u2018that\u2019 is also\noi according to Pi. So as long\nas there is a penumbral connection between Sam\u2019s word\n\u2018that\u2019 and Alex\u2019s word \u2018that\u2019, the\nsupervaluationist avoids the objection. Such a connection may seem\nmysterious at first, but note that Weatherson\u2019s theory predicts\nthat just such a penumbral connection obtains. So if that theory is\nacceptable, then Schiffer\u2019s objection misfires. \n \nObjection (From Neil Mackinnon 2002 and Thomas Sattig\n2013): It is part of our notion of a mountain that facts about\nmountain-hood are not basic. If something is a mountain, there are\nfacts in virtue of which it is a mountain, and nearby things are not.\nYet on each precisification of \u2018mountain\u2019, this\nwon\u2019t be true; it will be completely arbitrary which fusion of\nrocks is a mountain.\n\n\n\n\nReply: It is true that on any precisification there will be\nno principled reason why this fusion of rocks is a mountain, and\nanother is not. And it is true that there should be such a principled\nreason; mountainhood facts are not basic. But that problem can be\navoided by the theory that denies that \u201cthe supervaluationist\nrule [applies] to any statement whatever, never mind that the\nstatement makes no sense that way\u201d (Lewis 1993, 173).\nLewis\u2019s idea, or at least the application of Lewis\u2019s idea\nto this puzzle, is that we know how to understand the idea that\nmountainhood facts are non-arbitrary: we understand it as a claim that\nthere is some non-arbitrary explanation of which precisifications of\n\u2018mountain\u2019 are and are not admissible. If we must apply\nthe supervaluationist rule to every statement, including the statement\nthat it is not arbitrary which things are mountains, this\nunderstanding is ruled out. Lewis\u2019s response is to deny that the\nrule must always be applied. As long as there is some sensible way to\nunderstand the claim, we don\u2019t have to insist on applying the\nsupervaluationist machinery to it.\n\nThat said, it does seem like this is likely to be somewhat of a\nproblem for everyone (even the theorist like Lewis who uses the\nsupervaluationist machinery only when it is helpful). Sattig himself\nclaims to avoid the problem by making the mountain be a maximal fusion\nof candidates. But for any plausible mountain, it will be vague and\nsomewhat arbitrary what the boundary is between being a\nmountain-candidate and not being one. The lower boundaries of\nmountains are not, in practice, clearly marked. Similarly, there will\nbe some arbitrariness in the boundaries between the admissible and\ninadmissible precisifications of \u2018mountain\u2019. We may have\nto live with some arbitrariness. \n \nObjection (From J. Robert G. Williams 2006): When we look\nat an ordinary mountain, there definitely is (at least) one mountain\nin front of us. That seems clear. The vagueness solution respects this\nfact. But in many contexts, people tend to systematically confuse\n\u201cDefinitely, there is an F\u201d with \u201cThere is\na definite F.\u201d Indeed, the standard explanation of why\nSorites arguments seem, mistakenly, to be attractive is that this\nconfusion gets made. Yet on the vagueness account, there is no\ndefinite mountain; all the candidates are borderline cases. So by\nparity of reasoning, we should expect intuition to deny that there is\ndefinitely a mountain. And intuition does not deny that, it loudly\nconfirms it. At the very least, this shows a tension between the\nstandard account of the Sorites paradox, and the vagueness solution to\nthe Problem of the Many.\n\n\n\n\nReply: This is definitely a problem for the views that many\nphilosophers have put forward. As Williams stresses, it isn\u2019t on\nits own a problem for the vagueness solution to the Problem of the\nMany, but it is a problem for the conjunction of that solution with a\nwidely endorsed, and independently plausible, explanation of the\nSorites paradox. In his dissertation, Nicholas K. Jones (2010) argues\nthat the right response is to give up the idea that speakers typically\nconfuse \u201cDefinitely, there is an F\u201d with\n\u201cThere is a definite F\u201d, and instead use a\ndifferent resolution of the Sorites. \n \n\n\nSpace prevents a further discussion of all possible objections to the\nsupervaluationist account, but interested readers are particularly\nencouraged to look at Neil McKinnon\u2019s objection to the account\n(see the Other Internet Resources section), which suggests that\ndistinctive problems arise for the supervaluationist when there really\nare two or more clouds involved.\n\nEven if the supervaluationist solution to the Problem of the Many has\nresponses to all of the objections that have been levelled against it,\nsome of those objections rely on theories that are contentious and/or\nunderdeveloped. So it is far from clear at this stage how well the\nsupervaluationist solution, or indeed any solution based on vagueness,\nto the Problem of the Many will do in future years.\n8. Rethinking Parthood\n\nSome theorists have argued that the underlying cause of the problem is\nthat we have the wrong theory about the relation between parts and\nwholes. Peter van Inwagen (1990) argues that the problem is that we\nhave assumed that the parthood relation is determinate. We have\nassumed that it is always determinately true or determinately false\nthat one object is a part of another. According to van Inwagen,\nsometimes neither of these options applies. He thinks that we need to\nadopt some kind of\n fuzzy logic\n when we are discussing parts and wholes. It can be true to degree\n0.7, for example, that one object is part of another. Given these\nresources, van Inwagen says, we are free to conclude that there is\nexactly one cloud in the sky, and that some of the \u2018outer\u2019\nwater droplets are part of it to a degree strictly between 0 and 1.\nThis lets us keep the intuition that it is indeterminate whether these\noutlying water droplets are members of the cloud without accepting\nthat there are millions of clouds. Note that this is not what van\nInwagen would say about this version of the paradox, since he\nholds that some simples only constitute an object when that object is\nalive. For van Inwagen, as for Unger, there are no clouds, only\ncloud-like swarms of atoms. But van Inwagen recognises that a similar\nproblem arises for cats, or for people, two kinds of things that he\ndoes believe exist, and he wields this vague constitution theory to\nsolve the problems that arise there.\n\nTraditionally, many philosophers thought that such a solution was\ndownright incoherent. A tradition stretching back to Bertrand Russell\n(1923) and Michael Dummett (1975) held that vagueness was always and\neverywhere a representational phenomenon. From this perspective, it\ndidn\u2019t make sense to talk about it being vague or indeterminate\nwhether a particular droplet was part of a particular cloud. But this\ntraditional view has come under a lot of pressure in recent years; see\nBarnes (2010) for one of the best challenges, and Sorensen (2013,\nsection 8) for a survey of more work. So let us assume here it is\nlegitimate to talk about the possibility that parthood itself, and not\njust our representation of it, is vague. As Hudson (2001) notes\nthough, it is far from clear just how the appeal to fuzzy logic is\nmeant to help here. Originally it was clear for each of\nn water droplets whether they were members of the cloud to\ndegree 1 or degree 0. So there were 2n candidate\nclouds, and the Problem of the Many is finding out how to preserve the\nintuition when faced with all these objects. It is unclear how\nincreasing the range of possible relationships between each\nparticle and the cloud from 2 to continuum-many should help here, for\nnow it seems there are at least continuum-many cloud-like objects to\nchoose between, one for each function from each of the n\ndroplets to [0, 1], and we need a way of saying exactly one of them is\na cloud. Assume that some droplet is part of the cloud to degree 0.7.\nNow consider the object (or perhaps possible object) that is just like\nthe cloud, except this droplet is only part of it to degree 0.6. Does\nthat object exist, and is it a cloud? Van Inwagen says, in a way\nreminiscent of Markosian\u2019s brutal composition solution, that\nsuch an \u2018object\u2019 does not even exist. \n\nA different kind of solution is offered by Mark Johnston (1992) and E.\nJ. Lowe (1982, 1995). Both of them suggest that the key to solving the\nProblem is to distinguish cloud-constituters from clouds. They say it\nis a category mistake to identify clouds with any fusion of water\ndroplets, because they have different identity conditions. The cloud\ncould survive the transformation of half its droplets into puddles on\nthe footpath (or whatever kind of land it happens to be raining over),\nit would just be a smaller cloud, the fusion could not. As Johnston\nsays, \u201cHence Unger\u2019s insistent and ironic question\n\u2018But which of o1, o2,\no3, \u2026 is our paradigm cloud\nc?\u2019 has as its proper answer \u2018None\u2019\u201d\n(1992: 100, numbering slightly altered).\n\nLewis (1993) listed several objections to this position, and Lowe\n(1995) responds to them. (Lewis and Lowe discuss a version of the\nproblem using cats not clouds, and we will sometimes follow them\nbelow.)\n\nLewis\u2019s first objection is that positing clouds as well as\ncloud-constituting fusions of atoms is metaphysically extravagant. As\nLowe (and, for separate reasons, Johnston) point out, these extra\nobjects are arguably needed to solve puzzles to do with persistence.\nHence it is no objection to a solution to the Problem of the Many that\nit posits such objects. Resolving these debates would take us too far\nafield, so let us assume (as Lewis does) that we have reason to\nbelieve that these objects exist.\n\nSecondly, Lewis says that even with this move, we still have a Problem\nof the Many applied to cloud-constituters, rather than to clouds. Lowe\nresponds that since \u2018cloud-constituter\u2019 is not a folk\nconcept, we don\u2019t really have any philosophically salient\nintuitions here, so this cannot be a way in which the position is\nunintuitive.\n\nFinally, Lewis says that each of the constituters is so like the\nobject it is meant to merely constitute (be it a cloud, or a cat, or\nwhatever), it satisfies the same sortals as that object. So if we were\noriginally worried that there were 1001 cats (or clouds) where we\nthought there was one, now we should be worried that there are 1002.\nBut as Lowe points out, this argument seems to assume that being a\ncat, or being a cloud, is an intrinsic property. If we\nassume that it is extrinsic, if it turns on the history of the object,\nperhaps its future or its possible future, and on which object it is\nembedded in, then the fact that a cloud-constituter looks, when\nconsidered in isolation, to be a cloud is little reason to think it\nactually is a cloud.\n\nJohnston provides an argument that the distinction between clouds and\ncloud-constituting fusions of water droplets is crucial to solving the\nProblem. He thinks that the following principle is sound, and not\nthreatened by examples like our cloud.\n\n(9\u2032) If y is a paradigm F, and x is\nan entity that differs from y in any respect relevant to\nbeing an F only very minutely, and x is of the right\ncategory, i.e. is not a mere quantity or piece of matter, then\nx is an F. (Johnston 1992: 100)\n\n\nThe theorist who thinks that clouds are just fusions of water droplets\ncannot accept this principle, or they will conclude that every\noi is a cloud, since for them each\noi is of the right category. On the other hand,\nJohnston himself cannot accept it either, unless he denies there can\nbe another object c\u2032 which is in a similar position to\nc, and is of the same category as c, but differs\nwith respect to which water droplets constitute it. It seems that what\nis doing the work in Johnston\u2019s solution is not just the\ndistinction between constitution and identity, but a tacit restriction\non when there is a \u2018higher-level\u2019 object constituted by\ncertain \u2018lower-level\u2019 objects. To that extent, his theory\nalso resembles Markosian\u2019s brutal composition theory, though\nsince Johnston can accept that every set of atoms has a fusion his\ntheory has different costs and benefits to Markosian\u2019s\ntheory.\n\nA recent version of this kind of view comes from Nicholas K. Jones\n(2015), though he focusses on constitution, not composition. (Indeed,\na distinctive aspect of his view is that he takes constitution to be\nmetaphysically prior to composition.) Jones rejects the following\nprinciple, which is similar to 4 in the original inconsistent set.\n\nIf the water droplets in si constitute\noi, and the objects in sj\nconstitute oj, and the sets si\nand sk are not identical, then the objects\noi and oj are not\nidentical.\n\n\nHe rejects this claim. He argues that some water droplets can\nconstitute a cloud, and some other water droplets can constitute the\nvery same cloud. On this view, the predicate constitute x\nbehaves a bit like the predicate surround the building. It\ncan be true that the Fs surround the building, and the Gs surround the\nbuilding, without the Fs being the Gs. And on Jones\u2019s view, it\ncan be true that the Fs constitute x, and the Gs constitute\nx, without the Fs being the Gs. This resembles Lewis\u2019s\nsolution in terms of almost-identity, since both Jones and Lewis say\nthat there is one cloud, yet both si and\nsk can be said to compose it. But for Lewis, this\nis possible because he rejects the inference from There is one\ncloud, to If a and b are clouds, they are identical.\nJones accepts this inference, and rejects the inference from the\npremise that si and sk are\ndistinct, and each compose a cloud, to the conclusion that they\ncompose non-identical clouds. \n9. Rethinking Parthood\n\nAfter concluding that all of these kinds of solutions face serious\ndifficulties, Hudson (2001: Chapter 2) outlines a new solution, one\nwhich rejects so many of the presuppositions of the puzzle that it is\nbest to count him as rejecting the reasoning, rather than rejecting\nany particular premise. (Hudson is somewhat tentative about\nendorsing this view, as opposed to merely endorsing the claim\nthat it looks better than its many rivals, but for expository purposes\nlet us refer to it here as his view.) To see the motivation behind\nHudson\u2019s approach, consider a slightly different case, a variant\nof one discussed in Wiggins 1968. Tibbles is born at midnight Sunday,\nreplete with a splendid tail, called Tail. An unfortunate accident\ninvolving a guillotine sees Tibbles lose his tail at midday Monday,\nthough the tail is preserved for posterity. Then midnight Monday,\nTibbles dies. Now consider the timeless question, \u201cIs Tail part\nof Tibbles?\u201d Intuitively, we want to say the question is\nunderspecified. Outside of Monday, the question does not arise, for\nTibbles does not exist. Before midday Monday, the answer is\n\u201cYes\u201d, and after midday the answer is \u201cNo\u201d.\nThis suggests that there is really no proposition that Tail is part of\nTibbles. There is a proposition that Tail is part of Tibbles on Monday\nmorning (that\u2019s true) and that Tail is part of Tibbles on Monday\nafternoon (that\u2019s false), but no proposition involving just the\nparthood relation and two objects. Parthood is a three-place relation\nbetween two objects and a time, not a two-place relation between two\nobjects.\n\nHudson suggests that this line of reasoning is potentially on the\nright track, but that the conclusion is not quite right. Parthood is a\nthree-place relation, but the third place is not filled by a time, but\nby a region of space-time. To a crude approximation, x is\npart of y at s is true if (as we\u2019d normally\nsay) x is a part of y and s is a region of\nspace-time containing no region not occupied by y and all\nregions occupied by x. But this should be taken as a\nheuristic guide only, not as a reductive definition, since parthood is\nreally a three-place relation, so the crude approximation does not\neven express a proposition according to Hudson.\n\nTo see how this applies to the Problem of the Many, let\u2019s\nsimplify the case a little bit so there are only two water droplets,\nw1 and w2, that are neither\ndeterminately part of the cloud nor determinately not a part of it. As\nwell there is the core of the cloud, call it a. On an\northodox theory, there are four proto-clouds here, a,\na + w1, a +\nw2 and a + w1 +\nw 2. On Hudson\u2019s theory the largest and the\nsmallest proto-clouds still exist, but in the middle there is a quite\ndifferent kind of object, which we\u2019ll call c. Let\nr1 be the region occupied by a and\nw1, and r2 the region occupied\nby a and w2. Then the following claims\nare all true according to Hudson:\n\nc exactly occupies r1;\nc exactly occupies r2;\nc does not occupy the region consisting of the union of\nr1 and r2;\nc has w1 as a part at\nr1, but not at r2;\nc has w2 as a part at\nr2, but not at r1;\nc has no parts at the region consisting of the union of\nr1 and r2.\n\n\nHudson defines \u201cx exactly occupies s\u201d as\nfollows:\n\nx has a part at s,\nthere is no region of space-time, s*, such that\ns* has s as a subregion, while x has a part\nat s*, and\nfor every subregion of s, s\u2032, x\nhas a part at s\u2032. (Hudson 2001: 63)\n\n\nAt first, it might look like not much has been accomplished here. All\nthat we did was turn a Problem of 4 clouds into a Problem of 3 clouds,\nreplacing the fusions a + w1 and\na + w2 with the new, and oddly behaved,\nc. But that is to overlook a rather important feature of the\nremaining proto-clouds. The three remaining proto-clouds can be\nstrictly ordered by the \u2018part of\u2019 relation. This was not\npreviously possible, since neither a + w1\nnor a + w2 were part of the other. If we\nadopt the principle that \u2018cloud\u2019 is a maximal predicate,\nso no cloud can be a proper part of another cloud, we now get the\nconclusion that exactly one of the proto-clouds is a cloud, as\ndesired.\n\nThis is a quite ingenious approach, and it deserves some attention in\nthe future literature. It is hard to say what will emerge as the main\ncosts and benefits of the view in advance of that literature, but the\nfollowing two points seem worthy of attention. First, if we are\nallowed to appeal to the principle that no cloud is a proper part of\nanother, why not appeal to the principle that no two clouds massively\noverlap, and get from 4 proto-clouds to one actual cloud that way?\nSecondly, why don\u2019t we have an object that is just like the old\na + w1, that is, an object that has\nw1 as a part at r1, and does\nnot have w2 (or anything else) as a part at\nr2? If we get it back, as well as a +\nw2, then all of Hudson\u2019s tinkering with\nmereology will just have converted a problem of 4 clouds into a\nproblem of 5 clouds.\n\nNeither of these points should be taken to be conclusive refutations.\nAs things stand now, Hudson\u2019s solution joins the ranks of the\nmany and varied proposed solutions to the Problem of the Many. For\nsuch a young problem, the variety of these solutions is rather\nimpressive. Whether the next few years will see these ranks whittled\ndown by refutation, or swelled by imaginative theorising, remains to\nbe seen.",
