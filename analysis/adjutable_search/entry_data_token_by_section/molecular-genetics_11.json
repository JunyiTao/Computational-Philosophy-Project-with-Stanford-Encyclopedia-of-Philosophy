The analysis underlying this\nargument begins by distinguishing between two different ways\ncontemporary geneticists think about genes. Classical geneticists\noften conceived of genes as the functional units in chromosomes,\ndifferences in which cause differences in phenotypes. Today, in\ncontexts where genes are identified by way of observed phenotypic\ndifferences, geneticists still conceive of genes in this classical\nway, as the functional units in DNA whose differences are causing the\nobserved differences in phenotypes. This way of conceiving of genes is\ncalled the classical gene concept (Waters 1994). But\ncontemporary geneticists also think about genes in a different way by\ninvoking a molecular-level concept. The molecular gene\nconcept stems from the idea that genes are units in DNA that\nfunction to determine linear sequences in molecules synthesized via\nDNA expression. According to this analysis, both concepts are at work\nin contemporary geneticists.  Moss 2003 also distinguishes between two\ncontemporary gene concepts, which he calls \u201cgenes-P\n(preformationist)\u201d and \u201cgenes-D (developmental)\u201d. He\nargues that conflation of these concepts leads to erroneous thinking\nin genetics.\n\n\nMuch confusion concerning the classical way to think about genes is\ndue to the fact that geneticists have sometimes talked as if\nclassically conceived genes are for gross phenotypic\ncharacters (phenotypes) or as if individual genes produce phenotypes. This talk was very misleading on the part of\nclassical geneticists and continues to be misleading in the context of\ncontemporary genetics. The production of a gross phenotypic character,\nsuch as purple eye-color, involves all sorts of genetic and\nextra-genetic factors including various cellular enzymes and\nstructures, tissue arrangements, and environmental factors. In\naddition, it is not clear what, if any, gross phenotypic level\nfunctions can be attributed to individual genes. For example, it is no\nclearer today than it was in Morgan's day that the function of the\npurple gene discussed in section 2.1 is to contribute to the\nproduction of eye color. Mutations in this gene affect a number of\ngross phenotypic level traits. Legitimate explanatory reasoning\ninvoking the classical gene concept does not depend on any baggage\nconcerning what genes are for or what function a gene might have in\ndevelopment. What the explanatory reasoning depends on is the\ndifference principle, that is, the principle that some difference in\nthe gene causes certain phenotypic differences in particular genetic\nand environmental contexts (section 2.1). Many gene-based explanations\nin contemporary biology are best understood in terms of the classical\ngene concept and the difference principle.\n\n\nPerhaps the reason gene skeptics overlooked the molecular gene concept\nis that they were searching for the wrong kind of concept. The concept\nis not a purely physicochemical concept, and it does not provide a\nsingle partition of DNA into separate genes.  Instead, it is a\nfunctional concept that provides a uniform way to think about genes\nthat can be applied to pick out different DNA segments in different\ninvestigative or explanatory contexts. The basic\nmolecular concept, according to this analysis, is the concept of a\ngene for a linear sequence in a product of DNA expression:\n\n\n A gene g for linear sequence l in product p\nsynthesized in cellular context c is a potentially\nreplicating nucleotide sequence, n, usually contained in DNA,\nthat determines the linear sequence l in product p\nat some stage of DNA expression (Waters 2000) \n\n\nThe concept of the molecular gene can be presented as a 4-tuple:\n<n,l,p,c >.  This analysis\nshows how geneticists can consistently include introns as part of a\ngene in one epistemic context and not in another. If the context\ninvolves identifying a gene for a primary, preprocessed RNA molecule,\nthen the gene includes the introns as well as the exons. If the\ncontext involves identifying the gene for the resulting polypeptide,\nthen the gene includes only the exons. Hence, in the case of DNA\nexpression that eventually leads to the synthesis of a given\npolypeptide, geneticists might talk as if \u201cthe\u201d gene\nincluded the intron (in which case they would be referring to the gene\nfor the primary, preprocessed RNA) and yet also talk as if\n\u201cthe\u201d gene excluded the introns (in which case they would\nbe referring to the gene for the mature RNA or\npolypeptide). Application of the molecular gene concept is not\nambiguous; in fact, it is remarkably precise provided one specifies\nthe values for the variables in the expression \u201cgene for linear\nsequence l in product p synthesized in cellular\ncontext c.\u201d\n\n\nGene skeptics have suggested that there is a lack of coherence in gene\ntalk because biologists often talk as if genes code for polypeptides,\nbut then turn around and talk about genes for RNA molecules that are\nnot translated into polypeptides (including genes for RNA [tRNA],\nribosomal RNA [rRNA], and interference RNA [iRNA]). This account shows\nthat conceiving of genes for rRNA involves the same idea as conceiving\nof genes for polypeptides. In both cases, the gene is the segment of\nDNA, split or not, that determines the linear sequence in the molecule\nof interest.\n\n\nAn advantage of this analysis is that it emphasizes the limitations\nof gene-centered explanations while clarifying the distinctive causal\nrole genes play in the syntheses of RNA and polypeptides: genes\ndetermine the linear sequences of primary RNA transcripts and often\nplay a distinctive role, though not exclusive, in determining the\nsequence of amino acids in polypeptides.\n",
