    "main_text": "Does conceivability entail possibility? || Russellian monism\n5.3 Russellian monism \n\nFollowing Russell (1927), some philosophers suggest that physics tells\nus only about the \u2018structural\u2019 properties of things\n\u2014 such as their dispositions and nomic relations \u2014 rather\nthan the \u2018intrinsic\u2019 properties which supposedly underlie\nand account for those structural properties. Thus Daniel Stoljar\n(2001) argues that there are two distinct notions of the physical and\ncorrespondingly of physicalism, depending on whether one appeals only\nto what is provided for by physics or also to the intrinsic properties\nof physical objects. He suggests that even if one of the corresponding\ntwo versions of the conceivability argument is sound, the other is not\n\u2014 because (roughly) physicalists can always object that, since\nwe do not know enough about the physical world (in particular, about\nits intrinsic properties), we cannot \u2018strongly\u2019 conceive\nof the possibility of zombies.\n\nThese ideas are exploited in what Chalmers calls \u2018Russellian\nmonism\u2019 (a variety of neutral monism). In our world, he\nsuggests, the underlying intrinsic properties might be\n\u2018phenomenal properties, or they might be protophenomenal\nproperties: properties that collectively constitute phenomenal\nproperties when organized in the appropriate way\u2019 (2010: p.\n151); while in some other worlds the corresponding intrinsic physical\nproperties did not provide for consciousness. If the intrinsic\nproperties which supposedly provide for our consciousness are\nnevertheless classified as physical, exponents can deny the\npossibility of zombies if these are understood to be our\n\u2018full\u2019 physical duplicates. At the same time they can\nconcede the possibility of zombies which duplicate us only in their\nstructural properties. As he points out, this view is \u2018a highly\ndistinctive form of physicalism that has much in common with property\ndualism and that many physicalists will want to reject\u2019\n(Chalmers 2010, p. 152; see also Pereboom 2011). One obstacle to\ncounting it as physicalism is that it seems unable to explain why the\nspecial intrinsic properties in our world should provide for\nconsciousness, while those which perform the same functions in those\nother worlds do not: this has to be accepted as a brute fact. \n\nPhilip Goff (2010; see also his 2017) suggests that this loophole for\nRussellian versions of physicalism weakens the zombie argument. He\nrecommends instead an argument from ghosts: pure subjects of\nexperience without any physical nature. He argues that such ghosts are\nconceivable and possible, and that they provide an argument against\nphysicalism which leaves no loophole for Russellian monism.\n(Physicalists are likely to object that arguments against the\nconceivability of zombies can also be mobilized against ghosts.) \n",
