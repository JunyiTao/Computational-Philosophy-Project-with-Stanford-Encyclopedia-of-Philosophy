    "main_text": "Language Acquisition\n4. Language Acquisition\n\nThe three approaches to linguistic theorizing have at least something\nto say about how languages are acquired, or could in principle be\nacquired. Language acquisition has had a much higher profile since\ngenerative Essentialist work of the 1970s and 1980s gave it a central\nplace on the agenda for linguistic theory.\n\nResearch into language acquisition falls squarely within the\npsychology of language; see the entry on\n language and innateness.\n In this section we do not aim to deal in detail with any of the\nvoluminous literature on psychological or computational experiments\nbearing on language acquisition, or with any of the empirical study of\nlanguage acquisition by developmental linguists, or the\n\u2018stimulus poverty\u2019 argument for the existence of innate\nknowledge about linguistic structure (Pullum and Scholz 2002). Our\ngoals are merely to define the issue of linguistic\nnativism, set it in context, and draw morals for our three\napproaches from some of the mathematical work on inductive language\nlearning.\n",
