    "main_text": "Critique of multiculturalism || Universalist ideal of equality\n3.4 Universalist ideal of equality\n\nA fourth objection takes issue with liberal multiculturalist\u2019s\nunderstanding of what equality requires. Brian Barry defends a\nuniversalist ideal of equality, in contrast to the\ngroup-differentiated ideal of equality defended by Kymlicka. Barry\nargues that religious and cultural minorities should be held\nresponsible for bearing the consequences of their own beliefs and\npractices, just as members of the dominant culture are held\nresponsible for bearing the consequences of their beliefs. He does\nthink that special accommodations are owed to people with\ndisabilities, but he believes religious and cultural affiliations are\ndifferent from physical disabilities: the former do not constrain\npeople in the way that physical disabilities do. A physical disability\nsupports a strong prima facie claim to compensation because it limits\na person\u2019s opportunities to engage in activities that others are able\nto engage in. In contrast, religion and culture may shape one\u2019s\nwillingness to seize an opportunity, but they do not affect whether\none has an opportunity. Barry argues that egalitarian justice is only\nconcerned with ensuring a reasonable range of equal opportunities, not\nwith ensuring equal access to any particular choices or outcomes\n(2001, 37). When it comes to cultural and religious affiliations, they\ndo not limit the range of opportunities one enjoys but rather the\nchoices one can make within the set of opportunities available to\nall.\n\nIn reply, one might agree that opportunities are not objective in the\nstrong physicalist sense suggested by Barry. But the opportunity to do\nX is not just having the possibility to do X without facing physical\nencumbrances; it is also the possibility of doing X without incurring\nexcessive costs or the risk of such costs (Miller 2002, 51). State law\nand cultural commitments can conflict in ways such that the costs for\ncultural minorities of taking advantage of the opportunity are\nprohibitively high. In contrast to Barry, liberal multiculturalists\nargue that many cases where a law or policy disparately impacts a\nreligious or cultural practice constitute injustice. For instance,\nKymlicka points to the Goldman case (discussed above) and other\nreligion cases, as well as to claims for language rights, as examples\nin which group-differentiated rights are required in light of the\ndifferential impact of state action (1995, 108\u2013115). His\nargument is that since the state cannot achieve complete\ndisestablishment of culture or be neutral with respect to culture, it\nmust somehow make it up to citizens who are bearers of minority\nreligious beliefs and native speakers of other languages. Because\ncomplete state disestablishment of culture is not possible, one way to\nensure fair background conditions is to provide roughly comparable\nforms of assistance or recognition to each of the various languages\nand religions of citizens. To do nothing would be to permit\ninjustice.\n",
