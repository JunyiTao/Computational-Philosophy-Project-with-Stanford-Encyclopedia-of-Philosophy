    "main_text": "Ontic Structural Realism (OSR) || OSR and the Special Sciences\n4.4 OSR and the Special Sciences\n\nMuch of the work on ontic structural realism focuses on physics, but\nvarious authors have applied it much more widely. Gower (2000) argues\nthat structural realism seems less plausible about theories from\noutside of physics, and Mark Newman (2005) argues that structural\nrealism only applies to the mathematical sciences in therefore cannot\naccount for retention of theoretical commitments across theory change\nin, for example, biology. However, Sarkar (2020) is more optimistic\nabout the prospects for structural realism in biology if the focus is\non organisational structure rather than laws, and French (2011 and\n2014) also considers the implications of his form of ontic structural\nrealism for the ontology of biology. French (2016) defends eliminative\nOSR across the sciences. On the other hand, Ladyman and Ross (2007)\nargue for OSR as part of a form of realism about the sciences as a\nwhole, invoking the idea of real patterns due to Dennett and developed\nas part of Ross\u2019s \u201crainforest realism\u201d (see below).\nHarold Kincaid (2008) and Ross (2008) defend structural realist\napproaches to the social sciences. Tulodziecki (2016) considers the\nprospects of structural realism beyond physics. Ladyman (2008)\nconsiders the causal exclusion problem in the light of OSR, as does\nCordovil et al (2023). Beni (2019) develops a form of structural\nrealism for the cognitive sciences based on an analysis of\nrepresentation and the scientific understanding of the brain in terms\nof connectionist networks and activation patterns. Ryan Nefdt (2021,\n2023) develops a structural realist account of generative linguistics.\nPierpaolo Donati and Margaret Archer (2015) argue for a relational\nontology of individuals in sociology.\n\nThere are two ideas of general application to the special sciences\nassociated with OSR, namely, effective ontology and real patterns.\nTogether they provide for a degree of reconciliation of entity realism\nand structural realism in recent work, and both involve the idea of\nmodal structure which is of wider signficance. Arguably in all of\nscience except perhaps the ultimate physics, ontology is required only\nto be \u201ceffective\u201d in the sense of applying in some domain\nor regime which may be characterised in terms of the kinds of\nprocesses involved, or in terms of scales of energy, length and time.\nMost of physics is in fact like the special sciences in the sense of\nnot being fundamental, and not being applicable in all domains or\nregimes. For example, most of condensed matter physics \u2014 the\nstudy of all the properties of solids and liquids\u2014is not\napplicable to energy scales at which there is no ordinary matter, as\nin the heart of the sun or in the early universe. In physics,\nquasi-particles like phonons are taken to exist when their half-life\nis effectively infinite relative to the scale of the interactions that\nare being studied. As mentioned above, the quantum field theories of\nthe Standard Model of particle physics, and many other if not all\ntheories in physics are effective (see Wells 2012). In general,\nLadyman and Ross (2007) argue that ontology is scale-relative, in the\nsense that different energy levels and regimes, as well as different\nlength and time scales, feature different emergent structures of\ncausation and law, and that we should not assume that there is a\nfundamental level to reality.\n\nThe question of how the ontologies of the special sciences relate to\nmore fundamental theories obviously relates to structural realism\nbecause in many cases the strongly empirically successful theories of\nthe past are also the theories currently used in the relevant domain\n(see Robertson and Wilson forthcoming). For example, engineers and\nphysicists still use Newtonian forces and classical optics despite the\nfact the theories about them have more fundamental successors. The\nontology of such theories is effective as part of successful\nexplanations and predictions. The idea of effective ontology readily\nrelates to Dennett\u2019s idea of real patterns. A real pattern is,\nvery roughly, something that makes for a simplified description\nrelative to some background ontology. Real patterns are entities of\nwhatever ontological category that feature non-redundantly in\nprojectable regularities. For example, a wave on the beach is a real\npattern to a surfer, or a lifeguard, because it is taken as the basis\nfor prediction and explanation. Waves are ephemeral and fuzzy real\npatterns, and in general real patterns are more or less definite and\ndurable. David Wallace (2003) argues for the real-patterns account of\neffective emergent entities including worlds in the Everett\ninterpretation as well as quasi-particles. Seifert (forthcoming)\napplies the idea of real patterns to chemical bonds which must also be\nconsidered as part of effective ontology. The precise definition of\nreal patterns is a matter of debate. Ross sought to improve on\nDennett\u2019s original definition, Ladyman and Ross further refined\nit, and Su\u00f1\u00e9 and Mart\u00ednez (2021) criticise them\nand develop their own account. All agree that real patterns must be\nprojectable in the sense of supporting prediction and explanation and\nhence modal. It is natural to characterise this in\ninformation-theoretic term in terms of compressibility, though it may\nalso be thought about in terms of reduction in the effective number of\ndegrees of freedom needed to model the dynamics of the system\n(Millhouse 2021 argues that compressibility is not apt for capturing\nreal patterns that are coarse-grained with respect to the underlying\nontology).\n\nLadyman and Ross (2007) defend Rainforest Realism, which is realism\nabout the ontologies of the special sciences, by conjoining it with\nontic structural realism in the philosophy of physics. They adopt\nscientific realism about effective ontology, and use their account of\nreal patterns to provide a criterion of existence. According to the\nreal-patterns account old ontologies are retained in much of\nscientific practice because they continue to identify projectible\nregularities in their domains of applicability. Relatedly, David Glick\n(2021) argues that the basis of the structural realist\u2019s reply\nto the problem of theory change may be applied synchronically to allow\nfor a pluralist structural realism. The problems of vagueness of\ncomposition and identity over time, and hence of generation and\ncorruption all apply to both special science objects and everyday\nones. Composition is often dynamical, especially in science, but the\ntimescale of the interactions of the parts is very short compared to\nthe timescale characteristic of the whole. Generation and corruption\nare not events at the level of the parts, but real patterns can indeed\nbe created and destroyed by changes in the behaviour of other real\npatterns, and they can also persist over long time scales relative to\nthe scale of the interactions of their parts. Hence, the real-patterns\naccount of scale-relative ontology might provide a unified solution\nfor both problems (Ladyman 2017). Such an account could be interpreted\nas being of the pragmatics of an ultimately epistemological kind of\nemergence as perhaps for Wallace. However, if there is not, or might\nnot be, a fundamental level of reality, nor ultimate individuals of\nwhich everything else is made, then all real patterns are on a par. In\nthis or some other way, the structural realist, like all scientific\nrealists must give an account of the relationship between the\nontology, causation and law described by theories and models that\napply at different scales and so also in different sciences.\n",
