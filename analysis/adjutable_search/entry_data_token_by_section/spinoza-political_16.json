    "main_text": "The Tractatus Politicus || General Aim of the State\n4.2 General Aim of the State\n\n\nHaving established in the preceding chapters that anything that can\nbe done is done by right, Spinoza turns directly the question of how\nthe sovereign should exercise its power in Chapter Five,\nnoting that there is an important distinction between doing something\nby right and doing it in the best way (5/1). Here his concern is just\nto delineate the general aim of the state on the basis of which he can\ngive more fine-grained recommendations relative to regime forms (see\n4.3). The fundamental aim of the state, according to Spinoza, is\n\u201cpeace and security of life\u201d [pax vitaeque\nsecuritas] (5/2). To grasp what Spinoza means here we must try to\nunderstand what he means by peace. Spinoza rejects Hobbes\u2019\ndefinition of peace as the \u201cabsence of war\u201d (De\nCive 1, 12), calling it instead \u201ca virtue which comes from strength\nof mind\u201d (5/4), or a \u201cunion or harmony of minds\u201d\n(6/4). It is one thing for a state to persist or to avoid the ravages\nof war, it is quite another for the state to flourish. Spinoza makes\nthis point by way of an organic metaphor:\n\n\nSo when we say that the best state is one where men pass their lives\nin harmony, I am speaking of human life, which is characterized not\njust by the circulation of the blood and other features common to\nanimals, but especially by reason, the true virtue and life of the\nmind. (5/5)\n\n\nBut if the aim of the state is peace, and peace consists in the\n\u201charmony of minds\u201d or the rational activity, one might\nwonder how it is that the state could hope to achieve its end in light\nof Spinoza\u2019s skepticism concerning human rationality (1/5; 2/5;\n6/1). How is it that the state can promote the civic virtue or\n\u201cstrength of mind\u201d [fortitudo] on which peace\ndepends (5/2, 5/3)? This is perhaps the central normative question of\nthe TP (see Steinberg 2009; Steinberg 2018a). Spinoza addresses this\nquestion by way of offering institutional recommendations for each\nregime type.\n",
