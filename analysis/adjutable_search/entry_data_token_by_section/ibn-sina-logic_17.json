    "main_text": "Demonstration || Necessity\n6.3 Necessity\n\nOne of the single most important theoretical revisions of the\nAristotelian model concerns the notion of necessity (\u1e0dar\u016bra), which in fact\ntakes on a new role in Avicenna\u2019s system in a number of\ndifferent ways. At a general level, there is an epistemic notion\nassociated with the idea of certainty mentioned above; then there is a\ntechnical sense involved in Avicenna\u2019s reading of necessity\nstatements (which are unsurprisingly a major ingredient of scientific\ntheories); and finally there is a notion of necessity associated with\nscientific predication, which in a way is the most fundamental of\nall.\n\nTake \u201ctriangle\u201d as a subject of predication and consider\nthe following two sets of attributes: (i) \u201cbeing a\nplane figure enclosed by three straight lines\u201d or simply\n\u201cbeing a plane figure\u201d, and (ii) \u201chaving three\nangles\u201d or \u201chaving the sum of the internal angles equal to\ntwo right angles\u201d. All of these attributes are necessarily true of\n\u201ctriangle\u201d but, according to Avicenna, they are necessarily true of\ntheir subject in two quite different ways. The first two attributes,\n\u201cbeing a plane figure\u201d and \u201cbeing a plane figure\nenclosed by three straight lines\u201d are essential\nattributes of \u201ctriangle\u201d (the former is its genus, the latter is its\ndefinition); they are constitutive of it in a way that\nthe other attributes are not. Furthermore, \u201cbeing a figure\u201d is\nconceptually inseparable from \u201ctriangle\u201d and contained\nin its definition, in the sense that we cannot properly define\n\u201ctriangle\u201d, in its true nature, without appealing to that notion. By contrast\n\u201chaving the sum of the internal angles equal to two right angles\u201d\nis not at all required to define \u201ctriangle\u201d, even if it is necessarily\nimplied by it, and is in fact an attribute that we typically prove to\nhold of its subject. Essential attributes of the first kind are captured\nby definitions, and in general have an explanatory role with respect\nto attributes of the other kind. They explain the fact that attributes\nof the other kind hold of their subjects. In Aristotle\u2019s theory\nof science, these two types of attributes are usually designated by\nthe technical term \u201cper se\u201d.\n\nAvicenna also originally puts his own distinction between the\nreferential/substantial and descriptional reading to use in his theory\nof science. Each of the above two types of necessity (essential and\nnon-essential) can hold on either reading. In particular, the\ndescriptional reading, which Avicenna takes to be the default sense of\nnecessity in scientific discourse, allows us to study the properties\nof a given object qua object of a certain kind (a bronze\ntriangle qua triangle) and to make true, necessary\npredications about it as long as it is a triangle (but not as\nlong as it exists, as a bronze triangle could be re-cast into a\ndifferent shape and lose some of the properties that necessarily hold\nof it qua triangle) (Strobino 2015a).\n",
