    "main_text": "The Rights and Wrongs of Non-intuitionism\n4. The Rights and Wrongs of Non-intuitionism\n\nPrichard works initially with Sidgwick\u2019s contrast between\nintuitionism as the view that conduct is right when conforming to\ncertain principles known to be unconditionally binding, and\nnon-intuitionism as the view that there are ends at which we should\naim. (The view that there are ends that we should do what we can to\nrealize, which is a different view, is according to Prichard not\nSidgwick\u2019s official view, but a better view that Sidgwick should\nhave adopted instead.)\n\nPrichard argues that when one asks oneself what it is to aim at an\noutcome, the answer has to be that it is to act from the desire of it,\nthat is, to be motivated by the prospect of achieving it. But in that\ncase, Sidgwick (as a non-intuitionist) is maintaining that right\nactions are those that have a certain motive. And Prichard has his\nargument (which we have already seen) that we cannot be required to\nact from a certain motive, since our motivation is not something over\nwhich we have the required control. This form of non-intuitionism,\nthen, is a non-starter, despite the fact that it appears to be\nSidgwick\u2019s preferred form.\n\nWhat is more, Prichard thinks that even if it were true that we ought\nto aim at this end, it would not follow that we ought to do what (we\nthink) will lead to it. The derived \u2018ought\u2019 here can only\nbe identical with the sort of \u2018ought\u2019 that we derive in\nnon-moral cases, as when we say to a poisoner \u2018you ought to give\na second dose\u2019, and such an \u2018ought\u2019 has no force for\nthose who have not adopted the relevant end. This is partly because it\nis not true that we have a moral duty to do those actions that will\nlead to outcomes that we have a duty to aim at. We might, for\ninstance, have a duty to help the sick, and it may be that the only\nway to achieve that end is to write begging letters to our more\nprosperous friends. But it does not follow that we have a duty to\nwrite those letters. It will be true that we ought to write those\nletters, but this only means (says Prichard) that if we do not write\nthem, we will not achieve our end. The \u2018ought\u2019 here is the\nnon-moral \u2018ought\u2019.\n\nWe might think (and Broad did think) that Prichard cannot be right to\nsay that there are only two sorts of \u2018ought\u2019: the moral\none, full-blown, and the means-end one which only has force for those\nwho have adopted the end, and only says that if they don\u2019t take\nthis means they will not achieve that end. I myself would want to\nappeal to the normative force of advice. But Prichard\u2019s main\npoint might survive such a response. For all that he needs to\nestablish is that in order to show that we have a moral duty to write\nthe begging letters we need to do more than show that it is the best\nor only means to something which we have a moral duty to aim at.\n\nPrichard thinks, however, that Sidgwick never really considered the\nquestion what it is to aim at an outcome, and that if he had he would\nhave abandoned his official view for a very different view, namely\nthat our duty is not to aim at certain outcomes, but to achieve them\nor ensure them.\n\nThis new view, however, comes in two forms, which emerge when we ask\nwhat it is about those outcomes that gives us a duty to ensure them.\nThe first answer, which again we can attribute to Sidgwick, is that it\nis the value of those outcomes that grounds the relevant duty. But we\nhave already seen Prichard\u2019s attack on this view. He claims that\nit doesn\u2019t survive the test of instances; nobody thinks that\ntheir sense of obligation, when they feel obliged to do something,\narises from their recognition that in so acting they will be\noriginating something good. And even if they did, it is impossible to\nunderstand how the supposed duty can be derived from some fact about\ngoodness. For duty is imperatival in nature and goodness is not. We\nwould have to find some link between the goodness of the action and\nthe duty to act, and all such links are spurious.\n\nThe only remaining alternative is to say that the ground for our duty\nto ensure certain outcomes lies not in their value but in their\nnature. But Prichard claims that this is just a form of intuitionism\nin its conception of our duties \u2013 at least in its conception of\nthose duties that are grounded in outcomes (137\u201342). We are\ndealing with principles that are unconditionally binding, and which\nrequire us to achieve certain ends, or ensure certain outcomes. There\nis nothing here that is inconsistent with intuitionism, or even hard\nfor the intuitionist to explain. At this stage non-intuitionism\ncollapses into intuitionism. For the act which it is our duty to do is\nthe origination of a change, and the act of originating that change is\nnot a duty in virtue of its consequences, or outcomes; it is a duty in\nits own nature.\n\n(For an excellent discussion of Prichard\u2019s argument in this\nconnection, see Shaver 2018.)\n",
