Russell\u2019s logical\natomism is set forth chiefly in his 1918 work \u201cThe Philosophy of\nLogical Atomism\u201d (Russell 1956), Wittgenstein\u2019s in his\nTractatus Logico-Philosophicus of 1921 (Wittgenstein 1981).\nThe core tenets of Wittgenstein\u2019s logical atomism may be stated\nas follows: (i) Every proposition has a unique final analysis which\nreveals it to be a truth-function of elementary propositions\n(Tractatus 3.25, 4.221, 4.51, 5); (ii) These elementary\npropositions assert the existence of atomic states of affairs (3.25,\n4.21); (iii) Elementary propositions are mutually independent \u2014\neach one can be true or false independently of the truth or falsity of\nthe others (4.211, 5.134); (iv) Elementary propositions are immediate\ncombinations of semantically simple symbols or \u201cnames\u201d\n(4.221); (v) Names refer to items wholly devoid of complexity,\nso-called \u201cobjects\u201d (2.02 & 3.22); (vi) Atomic states\nof affairs are combinations of these objects (2.01).\n\nAlthough these doctrines are recognizably atomist in spirit, the term\n\u2018logical atomism\u2019 is not used by Wittgenstein. It was\nintroduced by Russell in his 1911 lecture to the French Philosophical\nSociety, Le R\u00e9alisme Analytique (Russell\n 1911).[1]\n Russell had advertised \u201cThe Philosophy of Logical\nAtomism\u201d as being \u201cvery largely concerned with explaining\ncertain ideas which [he had] learnt from [his] friend and former pupil\nLudwig Wittgenstein\u201d (Marsh, 177). No doubt partly as a result\nof this description, the term \u2018logical atomism\u2019\nsubsequently became associated with Wittgenstein\u2019s early\nphilosophy. The term is now standardly used to apply to a vaguely\ndefined set of doctrines centered on theses (i)\u2013(vi). In\nRussell\u2019s opinion, what makes it appropriate to speak of\nlogical atomism is that the atoms in question are to be\narrived at by logical rather than physical analysis (Russell 1956,\n179). For Wittgenstein too, the ultimate constituents of reality are\nto be revealed by a process of logical analysis; so, to that extent,\nthe label seems apt. It is not, however, uncontroversial (see Floyd\n1998 and\n 2007).[2]\n\n", "toc": [{"#NamObj": "1. Names and Objects"}, {"#LinAto": "2.

Names and Objects\n\nThe \u201cnames\u201d spoken of in the Tractatus are not\nmere signs (i.e., typographically or phonologically identified\ninscriptions), but rather signs-together-with-their-meanings \u2014\nor \u201csymbols.\u201d Being symbols, names are identified and\nindividuated only in the context of significant sentences. A name is\n\u201csemantically simple\u201d in the sense that its meaning does\nnot depend on the meanings of its orthographic parts, even when those\nparts are, in other contexts, independently meaningful. So, for\nexample, it would not count against the semantic simplicity of the\nsymbol \u2018Battle\u2019 as it figures in the sentence\n\u201cBattle commenced\u201d that it contains the orthographic part,\n\u201cBat,\u201d even though this part has a meaning of its own in\nother sentential contexts. For Wittgenstein, however, something else\ndoes count against this symbol\u2019s semantic simplicity, namely,\nthat it is analyzable away in favour of talk of the actions of people,\netc. This point suggests that in natural language Tractarian names\nwill be rare and hard to find. Even apparently simple singular terms\nsuch as \u2018Obama,\u2019 \u2018London,\u2019 etc., will not be\ncounted as \u201cnames\u201d by the strict standards of the\nTractatus since they will disappear on further analysis.\n(Hereafter, \u2018name\u2019 will mean \u201cTractarian name\u201d\nunless otherwise indicated.)\n\nIt is a matter of controversy whether the Tractatus reserves\nthe term \u2018name\u2019 for those semantically simple symbols that\nrefer to particulars, or whether the term comprehends semantically\nsimple symbols of all kinds. Since objects are just the referents of\nnames, this issue goes hand in hand with the question whether objects\nare one and all particulars or whether they include properties and\nrelations. The former view is defended by Irving Copi (Copi 1958) and\nElizabeth Anscombe (Anscombe 1959 [1971, 108 ff]), among others. It is\nsupported by Tractatus 2.0231: \u201c[Material properties]\nare first presented by propositions \u2014 first formed by the\nconfiguration of objects.\u201d This might seem to suggest that\nsimple properties are not objects but rather arise from the combining\nor configuring of objects. The Copi-Anscombe interpretation has been\ntaken to receive further support from Tractatus 3.1432:\n\nWe must not say, \u201cThe complex sign \u2018aRb\u2019\nsays \u2018a stands in relation R to\nb;\u2019\u201d but we must say, \u201cThat\n\u2018a\u2019 stands in a certain relation to\n\u2018b\u2019 says that aRb.\u201d\n\n\nThis has suggested to some commentators that relations are not,\nstrictly speaking, nameable, and so not Tractarian objects (see, for\nexample, Ricketts, 1996, Section III). It may, however, be intended\ninstead simply to bring out the point that Tractarian names are not\nconfined to particulars, but include relations between particulars; so\nthis consideration is less compelling. \n\nThe opposing view, according to which names include predicates and\nrelational expressions, has been defended by Erik Stenius and Merrill\nand Jaakko Hintikka, among others (Stenius, 1960, 61\u201369;\nHintikka and Hintikka, 1986, 30\u201334). It is supported by a\nNotebooks entry from 1915 in which objects are explicitly\nsaid to include properties and relations (NB, 61). It is\nfurther buttressed by Wittgenstein\u2019s explanation to Desmond Lee\n(in 1930\u20131) of Tractatus 2.01:\n\u201c\u2018Objects\u2019 also include relations; a proposition is\nnot two things connected by a relation. \u2018Thing\u2019 and\n\u2018relation\u2019 are on the same level.\u201d (LK,\n120).\n\nThe Anscombe-Copi reading treats the forms of elementary propositions\nas differing radically from anything we may be familiar with from\nordinary \u2014 or even Fregean \u2014 grammar. It thus respects\nWittgenstein\u2019s warning to Waismann in 1929 that \u201cThe\nlogical structure of elementary propositions need not have the\nslightest similarly with the logical structure of [non-elementary]\npropositions\u201d (WWK, 42).\n\nGoing beyond this, Wittgenstein seems once to have held that there\n can be no resemblance between the apparent or surface forms\nof non-elementary propositions and the forms of elementary\npropositions. In \u201cSome Remarks on Logical Form\u201d (1929) he\nsays: \u201cOne is often tempted to ask from an a priori standpoint:\nWhat, after all, can be the only forms of atomic propositions, and to\nanswer, e.g., subject-predicate and the relational propositions with\ntwo or more terms further, perhaps, propositions relating predicates\nand relations with one another, and so on. But this, I believe, is a\nmere playing with words\u201d (Klagge and Nordman, 1993, 30). A\nsimilar thought already occurs in a more compressed form in the\nTractatus itself: \u201cThere cannot be a hierarchy of the\nforms of the elementary propositions. Only that which we ourselves\nconstruct can we foresee\u201d (5.556).\n\nIt is possible, then, that the options we began with represent a false\ndichotomy. Perhaps Wittgenstein simply did not have an antecedent\nopinion on the question whether Tractarian names will turn out to be\nnames of particulars only, particulars and universals, or whatnot. And\nperhaps he believed that the final analysis of language would (or\nmight) reveal the names to defy such classifications altogether. This\nbroader range of interpretive possibilities has only recently begun to\nreceive the attention it deserves (See Johnston 2009).\n2. Linguistic Atomism\n\nBy \u201cLinguistic atomism\u201d we shall understand the view that\nthe analysis of every proposition terminates in a proposition all of\nwhose genuine components are names. It is a striking fact that the\nTractatus contains no explicit argument for linguistic\natomism. This fact has led some commentators \u2014 e.g., Peter\nSimons (1992) \u2014 to suppose that Wittgenstein\u2019s position\nhere is motivated less by argument than by brute intuition. And\nindeed, Wittgenstein does present some conclusions in this vicinity as\nif they required no argument. At 4.221, for example, he says:\n\u201cIt is obvious that in the analysis of propositions we\nmust come to elementary propositions, which consist of names in\nimmediate combination\u201d (emphasis added). Nonetheless, some basic\nobservations about the Tractatus\u2019s conception of\nanalysis will enable us to see why Wittgenstein should have thought it\nobvious that analysis must terminate in this way. \n2.1 Wittgenstein\u2019s Early Conception of Analysis\n\nA remark from the Philosophical Grammar, written in 1936,\nthrows light on how Wittgenstein had earlier conceived of the process\nof analysis: \n\nFormerly, I myself spoke of a \u2018complete analysis,\u2019 and I\nused to believe that philosophy had to give a definitive dissection of\npropositions so as to set out clearly all their connections and remove\nall possibilities of misunderstanding. I spoke as if there was a\ncalculus in which such a dissection would be possible. I vaguely had\nin mind something like the definition that Russell had given for the\ndefinite article (PG, 211).\n\n\nOne of the distinctive features of Russell\u2019s definition is that\nit treats the expression \u201cthe x such that\nFx\u201d as an \u201cincomplete symbol.\u201d Such symbols\nhave no meaning in isolation but are given meaning by contextual\ndefinitions that treat of the sentential contexts in which they occur\n(cf. PM, 66). Incomplete symbols do, of course, have\nmeaning because they make a contribution to the meanings of the\nsentences in which they occur (cf. Principles, Introduction,\nx). What is special about them is that they make this contribution\nwithout expressing a propositional constituent. (For more on the\nnature of incomplete symbols, see Pickel 2013)\n\nRussell\u2019s definition is contained in the following clauses (For\nthe sake of expository transparency, his scope-indicating devices are\nomitted.).\n\n\n[1] G(the x: Fx) =\n\u2203x(\u2200y(Fy\u2194y=x)\n& Gx) \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Df.\n\n(cf. Russell 1905b; Russell 1990, 173) \n\n[2] (the x: Fx) exists =\n\u2203x\u2200y(Fy\u2194y=x)\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Df.\n\n(cf. Russell 1990, 174)\n\n\nThe fact that existence is dealt with by a separate definition shows\nthat Russell means to treat the predicate \u2018exists\u2019 as\nitself an incomplete symbol. \n\nOne can understand why Wittgenstein should have taken there to be an\naffinity between the theory of descriptions and his own envisioned\n\u201ccalculus,\u201d for one can extract from his remarks in the\nTractatus and elsewhere two somewhat parallel proposals for\neliminating what he calls terms for \u201ccomplexes\u201d: \n\n[3] F[aRb] iff Fa & Fb &\naRb\n\n\n[4] [aRb] exists iff aRb\n\n\nClauses [1] to [4] share the feature that any sentence involving\napparent reference to an individual is treated as false rather than as\nneither true nor false if that individual should be discovered not to\nexist. \n\nWittgenstein\u2019s first contextual definition \u2014 our [3]\n\u2014 occurs in a Notebooks entry from 1914 (NB,\n4), but it is also alluded to in the Tractatus: \n\nEvery statement about complexes can be analysed into a statement about\ntheir constituent parts, and into those propositions which completely\ndescribe the complexes (2.0201).\n\n\nIn [3] the statement \u201cabout [the complex\u2019s] constituent\nparts\u201d is \u201cFa & Fb,\u201d while the\nproposition which \u201ccompletely describes\u201d the complex is\n\u201caRb.\u201d If the propositions obtained by applying\n[3] and [4] are to be further analysed, a two-stage procedure will be\nnecessary: first, the apparent names generated by the analysis \u2014\nin the present case \u2018a\u2019 and\n\u2018b\u2019 \u2014 will need to be\n replaced[3]\n with symbols that are overtly terms for complexes, e.g.,\n\u2018[cSd]\u2019 and \u2018[eFg];\u2019 second,\nthe contextual definitions [3] and [4] will need to be applied again\nto eliminate these terms. If there is going to be a unique final\nanalysis, each apparent name will have to be uniquely paired\nwith a term for a complex. So the program of analysis at which\nWittgenstein gestures, in addition to committing him to something\nanalogous to Russell\u2019s theory of descriptions, also commits him\nto the analogue of Russell\u2019s \u201cdescription theory of\nordinary names\u201d (cf. Russell 1905a). The latter is the idea that\nevery apparent name not occurring at the end of analysis is equivalent\nin meaning to some definite description. \n\nWittgenstein\u2019s first definition, like Russell\u2019s, strictly\nspeaking, stands in need of a device for indicating scope, for\notherwise it would be unclear how to apply the analysis when we\nchoose, say, \u201c~G\u201d as our instance of\n\u201cF.\u201d In such a case the question would arise\nwhether the resulting instance of [3] is [5]:\n\u201c~G[aRb] = ~Ga & ~Gb\n& aRb,\u201d which corresponds to giving the term for a\ncomplex wide scope with respect to the negation operator, or whether\nit is: [6] \u201c~G[aRb] = ~[Ga &\nGb & aRb],\u201d which corresponds to giving\nthe term for a complex narrow scope. One suspects that\nWittgenstein\u2019s intention would most likely have been to follow\nRussell\u2019s convention of reading the logical operator as having\nnarrow scope unless the alternative is expressly indicated (cf.\nPM, 172). \n\nDefinition [3] has obvious flaws. While it may work for such\npredicates as \u201cx is located in England,\u201d it\nobviously fails for certain others, e.g., \u201cx is greater\nthan three feet long\u201d and \u201cx weighs exactly four\npounds.\u201d This problem can hardly have escaped Wittgenstein; so\nit seems likely that he would have regarded his proposals merely as\ntentative illustrations, open to supplementation and refinement.\n\nAlthough Wittgenstein\u2019s second contextual definition \u2014 our\n[4] \u2014 does not occur in the Tractatus, it is implied by\na remark from the Notes on Logic that seems to anticipate\n2.0201: \n\nEvery proposition which seems to be about a complex can be analysed\ninto a proposition about its constituents and \u2026 the proposition\nwhich describes the complex perfectly; i.e., that proposition\nwhich is equivalent to saying the complex exists (NB,\n93; emphasis\n added)[4]\n\n\nSince the proposition that \u201cdescribes the complex,\u201d\n[aRb], \u201cperfectly\u201d is just the proposition that\naRb, Wittgenstein\u2019s clarifying addendum amounts to the\nclaim that the proposition \u201caRb\u201d is equivalent to\nthe proposition \u201c[aRb] exists.\u201d And this\nequivalence is just our [4].\n\nIt turns out, then, that existence is defined only in contexts in\nwhich it is predicated of complexes. Wittgenstein proposal thus\nmirrors Russell\u2019s in embodying the idea that it makes no sense\nto speak of the existence of immediately given (that is, named)\nsimples (cf. PM, 174\u20135). This is why Wittgenstein was\nlater to refer to his \u201cobjects\u201d as \u201cthat for which\nthere is neither existence nor non-existence\u201d (PR, 72).\nHis view seems to be that when \u2018a\u2019 is a\nTractarian name, what we try to say by uttering the nonsense string\n\u201ca exists\u201d will, strictly speaking, be\nshown by the fact that the final analysis of some proposition\ncontains \u2018a\u2019 (cf. 5.535). But of course, the\nTractatus does not always speak strictly. Indeed, what is\ngenerally taken to be the ultimate conclusion of the\nTractatus\u2019s so-called \u201cArgument for\nSubstance\u201d (2.021\u20132.0211) itself tries to say something\nthat can only be shown, since it asserts the existence of\nobjects. The sharpness of the tension here is only partly disguised by\nthe oblique manner in which the conclusion is formulated. Instead of\narguing for the existence of objects, the Tractatus argues\nfor the thesis that the world \u201chas substance.\u201d However,\nbecause \u201cobjects constitute the substance of the world\u201d\n(2.021), and because substance is that which exists\nindependently of what is the case (2.024), this is tantamount to\nsaying that objects exist. So it seems that Wittgenstein\u2019s\nargument for substance must be regarded as a part of the ladder we are\nsupposed to throw away (6.54). But having acknowledged this point, we\nshall set it aside as peripheral to our main concerns. \n\nThe most obvious similarity between the two sets of definitions is\nthat each seeks to provide for the elimination of what purport to be\nsemantically complex referring expressions. The most obvious\ndifference consists in the fact that Wittgenstein\u2019s definitions\nare designed to eliminate not definite descriptions, but rather terms\nfor complexes, for example the expression\n\u201c[aRb],\u201d which, judging by remarks in the\nNotebooks, is to be read: \u201ca in the relation R to\nb\u201d (NB, 48) (This gloss seems to derive from\nRussell\u2019s manner of speaking of complexes in Principia\nMathematica, where examples of terms for complexes include, in\naddition to \u201ca in the relation R to\nb,\u201d \u201ca having the quality\nq\u201d, and \u201ca and b and c\nstanding in the relation S\u201d (PM, 44).). One\nmight wonder why this difference should exist. That is to say, one\nmight wonder why Wittgenstein does not treat the peculiar locution\n\u201ca in the relation R to b\u201d as a\ndefinite description \u2014 say, \u201cthe complex consisting of\na and b, combined so that aRb\u201d? This\ndescription could then be eliminated by applying the\nTractatus\u2019s own variant upon the theory of\ndescriptions: \n\nThe F is G \u2194 \u2203x(Fx\n& Gx) & ~\u2203x,y(Fx\n& Fy)\n\n(cf. 5.5321)\n\n\nHere the distinctness of the variables (the fact that they are\ndistinct) replaces the sign for distinctness \u201c\u2260\u201d (cf.\n5.53).\n\nSince Wittgenstein did not adopt this expedient, it seems likely that\nhe would have regarded the predicate \u201cx is a complex\nconsisting of a and b, combined so that\naRb\u201d as meaningless in virtue of \u2014 among other\nthings \u2014 its containing ineliminable occurrences of the\npseudo-concepts \u201ccomplex,\u201d \u201ccombination,\u201d and\n\u201cconstitution.\u201d Only the first of these notions figures on\nhis list of pseudo-concepts in the Tractatus (4.1272), but\nthere is no indication that that list is supposed to be exhaustive.\n\n\nThere is a further respect in which Wittgenstein\u2019s analytical\nproposals differ from Russell\u2019s. Russell\u2019s second\ndefinition \u2014 our [2] \u2014 has the effect of shifting the\nburden of indicating ontological commitment from the word\n\u2018exists\u2019 to the existential quantifier. In\nWittgenstein\u2019s definition, by contrast, no single item of\nvocabulary takes over the role of indicating ontological commitment.\nInstead, that commitment is indicated only after the final\napplication of the definition, by the meaningfulness of the names in\nthe fully analysed proposition \u2014 or, more precisely, by the fact\nthat certain symbols are names (cf. 5.535). The somewhat paradoxical\nconsequence is that one can assert a statement of the form\n\u201c[aRb] exists\u201d without thereby manifesting any\nontological commitment to the complex [aRb] (cf.\nEPB, 121). What this shows is that the two theories relieve\nthe assertor of ontological commitments of quite different kinds. In\nRussell\u2019s case, the analysis \u2014 our [2] \u2014 removes a\ncommitment to an apparent propositional constituent \u2014 a\n\u201cdenoting concept\u201d\n [5]\n \u2014expressed by the phrase \u2018the F,\u2019 but it\ndoes not remove the commitment to the F itself. For\nWittgenstein, by contrast, the analysis shows that the assertor never\nwas ontologically committed to the complex [aRb] by an\nutterance of \u201c[aRb] exists.\u201d \n\nRussell\u2019s conception of analysis at the time of the theory of\ndescriptions \u2014 c.a. 1905 \u2014 is relatively clear: Analysis\ninvolves pairing up one sentence with another that expresses the very\nsame Russellian proposition but which does so more perspicuously. The\nanalysans counts as more perspicuous than the analysandum because the\nformer is free of some of the latter\u2019s merely apparent\nontological commitments. By the time of Principia\nMathematica, however, this relatively transparent conception of\nanalysis is no longer available. Having purged his ontology of\npropositions in 1910, Russell can no longer appeal to the idea that\nanalysans and analysandum express one and the same proposition. He now\nadopts \u201cthe multiple relation theory of judgment,\u201d\naccording to which the judgment (say) that Othello loves Desdemona,\ninstead of being, as Russell had formerly supposed, a dyadic relation\nbetween the judging mind and the proposition Othello loves\nDesdemona, is now a non-dyadic, or, in Russell\u2019s\nterminology, \u201cmultiple,\u201d relation whose relata are the\njudging mind and those items that were formerly regarded as\nconstituents of the proposition Othello loves Desdemona\n(Russell 1910 [1994, 155]). After 1910 Russell can say that a speaker who\nsincerely assertively uttered the analysans (in a given context) would\nbe guaranteed to make the same judgment as one who sincerely\nassertively uttered the analysandum (in the same context), but he can\nno longer explain this accomplishment by saying that the two sentences\nexpress the same proposition. \n\nA further departure from the earlier, relatively transparent\nconception of analysis is occasioned by Russell\u2019s resolution of\nthe set-theoretic version of his paradox. In this resolution one gives\nan analysis of a sentence whose utterance could not be taken to\nexpress any judgment. One argues that the sentence\n\u201c{x: \u03c6x} \u03b5 {x:\n\u03c6x}\u201d is nonsense because the contextual definitions\nproviding for the elimination of class terms yield for this case a\nsentence that is itself nonsense by the lights of the theory of types\n(PM, 76). It\u2019s (apparent) negation is, accordingly,\nalso nonsense. In Principia, then, there is no very clear\nmodel of what is preserved in analysis. The best we can say is that\nRussell\u2019s contextual definitions have the feature that a\n(sincere, assertive) utterance of the analysans is guaranteed to\nexpress the same judgment as the analysandum, if the latter\nexpresses a judgment at all. \n\nSome of the unclarity in the conception of analysis introduced by\nRussell\u2019s rejection of propositions is inherited by\nWittgenstein, who similarly rejects any ontology of shadowy entities\nexpressed by sentences. In the Tractatus a\n\u201cproposition\u201d (Satz) is a \u201cpropositional\nsign in its projective relation to the world\u201d (3.12). This makes\nit seem as though any difference between propositional signs ought to\nsuffice for a difference between propositions, in which case analysans\nand analysandum could at best be distinct propositions with the same\ntruth conditions. \n\nEnough has now been said to make possible a consideration of\nWittgenstein\u2019s reasons for describing the position I have been\ncalling \u201clinguistic atomism\u201d as \u201cobvious.\u201d\nSince the model for Tractarian analysis is the replacement of apparent\nnames with (apparently) co-referring \u201cterms for\ncomplexes,\u201d together with eliminative paraphrase of the latter,\nit follows trivially that the endpoint of analysis, if there is one,\nwill contain neither \u201cterms for complexes\u201d nor expressions\nthat can be replaced by terms for complexes. \n\nWittgenstein, moreover, thinks it obvious that in the case of every\nproposition this process of analysis does terminate. The\nreason he supposes analysis cannot go on forever is that he conceives\nan unanalyzed proposition as deriving its sense from its\nanalysis. As Tractatus 3.261 puts it: \u201cEvery defined\nsign signifies via those signs by which it is defined\u201d (Cf.\nNB, 46; PT 3.20102). It follows that no proposition\ncan have an infinite analysis, on pain of never acquiring a sense. So\nthe process of analysis must terminate, and when it does so the\nproduct will be propositions devoid of incomplete symbols. \n\nThat much, at least, is plausibly obvious, but unfortunately\nit does not follow that the final analysis of language will be wholly\ndevoid of complex symbols. The trouble is that for all we have said so\nfar, a fully analysed proposition might yet contain one or more\ncomplex symbols that have meaning in their own right.\nClearly, Wittgenstein must have been assuming that all genuine\nreferring expressions must be semantically simple: they must lack\nanything like a Fregean sense. But why should that be so? The seeds of\none answer are contained in Tractatus 3.3, the proposition in\nwhich Wittgenstein enunciates his own version of Frege\u2019s context\nprinciple: \u201cOnly the proposition has sense; only in the context\nof a proposition has a name meaning\u201d (3.3). Wittgenstein\u2019s\njuxtaposition of these two claims suggests that the context principle\nis supposed to be his ground for rejecting senses for sub-sentential\nexpressions. But just how it could provide such a ground is far from\nclear. Another, more concrete, possibility is that Wittgenstein simply\naccepted the arguments Russell had given in \u201cOn Denoting\u201d\nfor rejecting senses for sub-sentential expressions. \n3. Metaphysical Atomism\n\nBy \u201cMetaphysical atomism\u201d we will understand the view that\nthe semantically simple symbols occurring in a proposition\u2019s\nfinal analysis refer to simples. The Tractatus does not\ncontain a distinct freestanding argument for this thesis,\nbut, as we will see, the needed argument is plausibly extractable from\nthe famous \u201cArgument for Substance\u201d of 2.0211\u20132:\n\n\n2.0211 If the world had no substance, then whether a proposition had\nsense would depend on whether another proposition was true.\n\n\n2.0212 It would then be impossible to draw up a picture of the world\n(true or false).\n\n\nTo see what precisely is being contended for in this argument one\nneeds to appreciate the historical resonances of Wittgenstein\u2019s\ninvocation of the notion of \u201csubstance.\u201d\n3.1 Objects as the Substance of the World\n\nThe Tractatus\u2019s notion of substance is the modal\nanalogue of Kant\u2019s temporal notion. Whereas for Kant, substance\nis that which \u201cpersists\u201d (in the sense of existing at all\ntimes) (Critique, A 182), for Wittgenstein it is that which,\nfiguratively speaking, \u201cpersists\u201d through a\n\u201cspace\u201d of possible worlds. (Compare the idea of a road\nthat crosses several U.S. States. Such a road might be said,\nmetaphorically speaking, to \u201cpersist\u201d from one State to\nthe next: in such a locution, as in Wittgenstein's, a temporal notion\nis enlisted to do spatial duty, though in Wittgenstein's case the\nspace in question is logical rather than physical space and\npersistence amounts to reaching through the whole of logical\nspace.) Tractarian substance is the \u201cunchanging\u201d in the\nmetaphorical sense of that which does not undergo existence change in\nthe passage (also metaphorical) from world to world. Less\nfiguratively, Tractarian substance is that which exists with respect\nto every possible world. For Kant, to assert that there is substance\n(in the schematized sense of the category) is to say that that there\nis some stuff such that every existence change (i.e., origination or\nannihilation) is necessarily an alteration or reconfiguration of that\nstuff. For Wittgenstein, analogously, to say that there is substance\nis to say that there are some things such that all \u201cexistence\nchanges\u201d in the metaphorical passage from world to world are\nreconfigurations of them. What undergo \u201cexistence changes\u201d\nare atomic states of affairs (configurations of objects): a state of\naffairs exists with respect to one world but fails to exist with\nrespect to another. Those things that remain in existence through\nthese existence changes, and which are reconfigured in the process,\nare Tractarian objects. It follows that the objects that\n\u201cconstitute the substance of the world\u201d (2.021) are\nnecessary existents. The Tractatus , rather wonderfully,\ncompresses this whole metaphorical comparison into a single remark:\n\u201cThe object is the fixed, the existing [das\nBestehende]; the configuration is the changing [das\nWechselnde].\u201d (2.0271). \u201cWechsel,\u201d it\nshould be noted, is the word that Kant expressly reserves for the\nnotion of existence change as opposed to alteration\n(Critique, A 187/B 230). (Unfortunately, however, whether\nWittgenstein had read the Critique in time for this\ncircumstance to have influenced his own phrasing in the\nTractatus is unknown.)\n\nTractarian objects are what any \u201cimagined\u201d\u2014or, more\naccurately, conceivable\u2014world has in common with the\nreal world (2.022). Accordingly, they constitute the world\u2019s\n\u201cfixed form\u201d (2.022\u20133). \u2018Fixed\u2019 because,\nunlike the world\u2019s content, objects (existentially speaking)\nhold fast in the transition from world to world. \u2018Form\u2019\nbecause they constitute what is shared by all the worlds. (On\nWittgenstein\u2019s conception of possibility, the notion of an\n\u201calien\u201d Tractarian object \u2014 one which is\nmerely possible \u2014 is not even intelligible). If the\nobjects make up the world\u2019s form, what makes up its content? The\nanswer, I think, is the various obtaining atomic states of affairs.\nDistinct worlds differ with respect to content because they differ\nwith respect to which possible states of affairs obtain in them. A\ncomplication arises becasue possible atomic states of affairs also\nhave both form and content form and content. Their form is the manner\nof combination of their components, their content those components\nthemselves (that is, their contained objects). It follows that\nsubstance \u2014 the totality of objects \u2014 is indeed, as\nWittgenstein says, \u201cboth form and content\u201d\n(2.024\u20135). It is at once both the form of the world and the\ncontent of possible states of affairs (These and further details of\nthis interpretation of Wittgenstein\u2019s conception of substance as\nthe fixed or unchanging are provided in Proops 2004; see also\nZalabardo 2015, Appendix II for more on simples, names, and necessary\nexistents). \n3.2 The Argument for Substance\n\nAs we have seen, the immediate goal of the argument for substance is\nto establish that there are things that exist necessarily. In the\ncontext of the assumption that anything complex could fail to exist\nthrough decomposition, this conclusion entails that there are simples\n(2.021). While the argument is presented as a two-stage modus\ntollens, it is conveniently reconstructed as a reductio ad\nabsurdum (The following interpretation of the argument is a\ncompressed version of that provided in Proops 2004. For two recent\nalternatives, see Zalabardo 2015, 243\u2013254 and Morris 2008, ch.1,\nand 2017; and for criticisms of Morris, see Potter 2009): \n\nSuppose, for reductio, that\n\n\u00a0\u00a0[1] There is no substance (that is, nothing exists in\nevery possible world).\n\nThen\n\n\u00a0\u00a0[2] Everything exists contingently.\n\nBut then\n\n\u00a0\u00a0[3] Whether a proposition has sense depends on whether\nanother proposition is true.\n\nSo\n\n\u00a0\u00a0[4] We cannot draw up pictures of the world (true or\nfalse).\n\nBut\n\n\u00a0\u00a0[5] We can draw up such pictures.\n\n\nContradiction So\n\n\u00a0\u00a0[6] There is substance (that is, some things exist in\nevery possible world).\n\n\n\nOur [5] is the main suppressed premise. It means, simply, that we can\nframe senseful propositions. Let us now consider how we might try to\ndefend the inference from [2] to [3] on Wittgensteinian principles. As\na preliminary, note that, given Wittgenstein\u2019s equation in the\nNotes on Logic of having sense with having truth-poles\n(NB, 99), it seems reasonable to suppose that for a sentence\nto \u201chave sense\u201d with respect to a given world is for it to\nhave a truth value with respect to that world. Let us assume that this\nis so. Now suppose that everything exists contingently. Then, in\nparticular, the referents of the semantically simple symbols occurring\nin a fully analysed sentence will exist contingently. But then any\nsuch sentence will contain a semantically simple symbol that fails to\nrefer with respect to some possible world (As we will shortly see,\nthis step is in fact controversial.). Suppose, as a background\nassumption, that there are no contingent simples. (It will be argued\nbelow that this assumption plausibly follows from certain Tractarian\ncommitments.) Then, if we assume that a sentence containing a\nsemantically simple term is neither true nor false evaluated with\nrespect to a world in which its purported referent (namely, a complex\nexisting contingently at the actual world) fails to exist \u2014 and,\nfor now, we do \u2014 then, for any such fully analysed sentence,\nthere will be some world such that the sentence depends for its truth\nvaluedness with respect to that world on the truth with respect to\nthat world of some other sentence, viz., the sentence stating\nthat the constituents of the relevant complex are configured in a\nmanner necessary and sufficient for its existence. It follows that if\neverything exists contingently, then whether a sentence is senseful\nwith respect to a world will depend on whether another sentence is\ntrue with respect to that world.\n\nThe step from [3] to [4] runs as follows. Suppose that whether any\nsentence \u201chas sense\u201d (i.e., on our reading, has a\ntruth-value) depends (in the way just explained) on whether another is\ntrue. Then every sentence will have an \u201cindeterminate\nsense\u201d in the sense that it will lack a truth value with respect\nto at least one possible world. But an indeterminate sense is no sense\nat all, for a proposition by its very nature \u201creaches through\nthe whole logical space\u201d (3.42) (i.e., it is truth-valued with\nrespect to every possible\n world).[6]\n So if every sentence depended for its \u201csense\u201d (i.e.,\ntruth-valuedness) on the truth of another, no sentence would have a\ndeterminate sense, and so no sentence would have a sense. In which\ncase we would be unable to frame senseful propositions (i.e., to\n\u201cdraw up pictures of the world true or false\u201d). \n\nOne apparent difficulty concerns the assumption that to have sense is\njust to be true or false. How can such a view be attributed to the\nWittgenstein of the Tractatus given his view that tautology,\nwhich is true, and contradiction, which is false, are without sense\n(sinnlos) (4.461)? The seeds of an answer may be contained in\na remark from Wittgenstein\u2019s lectures at Cambridge during the\nyear 1934\u20131935. Looking back on what he\u2019d written in the\nTractatus, he says:\n\nWhen I called tautologies senseless I meant to stress a connection\nwith a quantity of sense, namely 0. ([AM]), 137)\n\n\nIt is possible, then, that Wittgenstein is thinking of a\nsinnlos proposition as a proposition that \u201chas\nsense\u201d but has it to a zero degree. According to this\nconception, a tautology, being true, is, in contrast to a nonsensical\nstring, in the running for possessing a non-zero quantity of sense,\nbut is so constructed that, in the end, it doesn\u2019t get to have\none. And, importantly, in virtue of being in the running for having a\nnon-zero quantity of sense its possession of a zero quantity amounts\nto its, broadly speaking, \u2018having sense\u2019. Such a view,\naccording to which, for some non-count noun N, an N-less entity has N,\nbut has a zero quantity of it, is not without precedent in the\ntradition. Kant, for example, regards rest (motionlessness) as a\nspecies of motion: a zero quantity of it (Bader, Other Internet\nResources, 22\u201323). If, in a similar fashion,\nSinnlosigkeit is a species of Sinn, the equation of\nhaving Sinn with being true or false will be preserved. To\noffer a full defence of this understanding of Sinnlosigkeit\nwould take us too far afield, but I mention it to show that the\ncurrent objection is not decisive.\n\nAnother apparent difficulty for this reconstruction arises from its\nappearing to contradict Tractatus 3.24, which clearly\nsuggests that if the complex entity A were not to exist, the\nproposition \u201cF[A]\u201d would be false,\nrather than, as the argument requires, without truth value. But the\ndifficulty is only apparent. It merely shows that 3.24 belongs to a\ntheory that assumes that the world does have substance. On\nthis assumption Wittgenstein can say that whenever an apparent name\noccurs that appears to mention a complex this is only because it is\nnot, after all, a genuine name \u2014 and this is what he does say.\nBut on the assumption that the world has no substance, so that\neverything is complex, Wittgenstein can no longer say this.\nFor now he must allow that the semantically simple symbols occurring\nin a proposition\u2019s final analysis do refer to complexes. So in\nthe context of the assumption that every proposition has a final\nanalysis, the reductio assumption of the argument for\nsubstance entails the falsity of 3.24. But since 3.24 is assumed to be\nfalse only in the context of a reductio, it is something that\nWittgenstein can consistently endorse (This solution to the apparent\ndifficulty for the present reconstruction is owed, in its essentials,\nto David Pears (see Pears 1987 [1989, 78]).\n\nTo complete the argument it only remains to show that Tractarian\ncommitments extrinsic to the argument for substance rule out\ncontingent\n simples.[7]\n Suppose a is a contingent simple. Then \u201ca\nexists\u201d must be a contingent proposition. But it cannot be an\nelementary proposition because it will be entailed by any elementary\nproposition containing \u2018a,\u2019 and elementary\npropositions are logically independent (4.211). So \u201ca\nexists\u201d must be non-elementary, and so further analyzable. And\nyet there would seem to be no satisfactory analysis of this\nproposition on the assumption that \u2018a\u2019 names a\ncontingent simple \u2014 no analysis, that is to say, that is both\nintrinsically plausible and compatible with Tractarian principles.\nWittgenstein cannot analyse \u201ca exists\u201d as the\nproposition \u201c\u2203x(x = a)\u201d\nfor two reasons. First, he would reject this analysis on the grounds\nthat it makes an ineliminable use of the identity sign (5.534).\nSecond, given his analysis of existential quantifications as\ndisjunctions, the proposition \u201c\u2203x(x =\na)\u201d would be further analysed as the\nnon-contingent proposition \u201ca = a\n\u2228 a = b \u2228 a =\nc\u2026\u201d. Nor can he analyse \u201ca\nexists\u201d as \u201c~[ ~Fa & ~Ga &\n~Ha\u2026]\u201d \u2014 that is, as the negation of the\nconjunction of the negations of every elementary proposition involving\n\u201ca.\u201d To suppose that it could, is to suppose that\nthe proposition \u201c~Fa & ~Ga &\n~Ha\u2026\u201d means \u201ca does not\nexist,\u201d and yet by the lights of the Tractatus this\nproposition would show a\u2019s existence \u2014\nor, more correctly, it would show something that one tries to put into\nwords by saying \u201ca exists\u201d (cf. 5.535,\nCorr, 126)). So, pending an unforeseen satisfactory analysis\nof \u201ca exists,\u201d this proposition will have to be\nanalysed as a complex of propositions not involving a. In\nother words, \u2018a\u2019 will have to be treated as an\nincomplete symbol and the fact of a\u2019s existence will\nhave to be taken to consist in the fact that objects other than\na stand configured thus and so. But that would seem to entail\nthat a is not simple.\n\nThe argument for substance may be criticized on several grounds.\nFirst, the step leading from [2] to [3] relies on the assumption that\na name fails to refer with respect to a possible world at which its\nactual-world referent does not exist. This amounts to the\ncontroversial assumption that names do not function as what Nathan\nSalmon has called \u201cobstinately rigid designators\u201d (Salmon\n1981, 34). Secondly, the step leading from [3] to [4] relies on the\nassumption that a sentence that is neither true nor false with respect\nto some possible world fails to express a sense. As Wittgenstein was\nlater to realize, the case of intuitively senseful, yet vague\nsentences plausibly constitutes a counterexample (cf. PI\nSection 99). Lastly, one may question the assumption that it makes\nsense to speak of a final analysis, given that the procedure for\nanalysing a sentence of ordinary language has not been made clear (See\nPI, Sections 60, 63\u20134, and Section 91). \n4. The Epistemology of Logical Atomism\n\nHow could we possibly know that something is a Tractarian object?\nWittgenstein has little or nothing to say on this topic in the\nTractatus, and yet it is clear from his retrospective remarks\nthat during the composition of the Tractatus he did think it\npossible in principle to discover the Tractarian objects (See\nAM, 11 and EPB, 121). So it seems worth asking by\nwhat means he thought such a discovery might be made. \n\nSometimes, it can seem as though Wittgenstein just expected to hit\nupon the simples by reflecting from the armchair on those items that\nstruck him as most plausibly lacking in proper parts. This impression\nis most strongly suggested in the Notebooks, and in\nparticular in a passage from June 1915 in which Wittgenstein seems to\nexpress confidence that certain objects already within his ken either\ncount as Tractarian objects or will turn out to do so. He says:\n\u201cIt seems to me perfectly possible that patches in our visual\nfield are simple objects, in that we do not perceive any single point\nof a patch separately; the visual appearances of stars even seem\ncertainly to be so\u201d (NB, 64). By \u201cpatches in our\nvisual field\u201d in this context Wittgenstein means parts of the\nvisual field with no noticeable parts. In other words, points\nin visual space (cf. KL, 120). Clearly, then, Wittgenstein at\none stage believed he was in a position to specify some Tractarian\nobjects. However, the balance of the evidence suggests that this idea\nwas short-lived. For he was later to say that he and Russell had\npushed the question of examples of simples to one side as a matter to\nbe settled on a future occasion (AM, 11). And when Norman\nMalcolm pressed Wittgenstein to say whether when he wrote the\nTractatus he had decided on anything as an example of a\n\u201csimple object,\u201d he had replied \u2014 according to\nMalcolm\u2019s report \u2014 that \u201cat the time his thought had\nbeen that he was a logician; and that it was not his business as a\nlogician, to try to decide whether this thing or that was a simple\nthing or a complex thing, that being a purely empirical matter\u201d\n(Malcolm 1989, 70).\n\nWittgenstein was not suggesting that the correct way to establish that\nsomething is a Tractarian object is to gather evidence that its\ndecomposition is physically impossible. That reading would\nonly have a chance of being correct if Wittgenstein had taken\nmetaphysical possibility to coincide with physical possibility, and\nthat is evidently not\n so.[8]\n His meaning seems rather to be just that the objects must be\ndiscovered rather than postulated or otherwise specified in advance of\ninvestigation (cf. AM, 11). But since Wittgenstein was later\nto accuse his Tractarian self of having entertained the concept of a\ndistinctive kind of philosophical discovery (see WVC\n182, quoted below), we must not jump \u2014 as Malcolm appears to\nhave done, to the conclusion that he conceived of the discovery in\nquestion as \u201cempirical\u201d in anything like the contemporary\nsense of the word. \n\nWe know that Wittgenstein denied categorically that we could\nspecify the possible forms of elementary propositions and the\nsimples a priori (4.221, 5.553\u20135.5541, 5.5571). But he\ndid not deny that these forms would be revealed as the result of\nlogical analysis. In fact, he maintained precisely this view. This\nidea is not explicit in the Tractatus, but it is spelled out\nin a later self-critical remark from G. E. Moore\u2019s notes of\nWittgenstein\u2019s 1933 lectures at Cambridge: \n\nI say in [the] Tractatus that you can\u2019t say anything\nabout [the] structure of atomic prop[osition]s: my idea being the\nwrong one, that logical analysis would reveal what it would reveal\n(entry for 6 February, 1933, Stern et. al., 2016, 252)\n\n\nSpeaking of Tractarian objects in another retrospective remark, this\ntime from a German version of the Brown Book, Wittgenstein\nsays: \u201cWhat these [fundamental constituents] of reality are it\nseemed difficult to say. I thought it was the job of further logical\nanalysis to discover them\u201d (EPB 121). These remarks\nshould be taken at face value: it is logical analysis \u2014 the\nanalysis of propositions \u2014 that is supposed to enable us to\ndiscover the forms of elementary propositions and the objects. The\nhope is that when propositions have been put into their final, fully\nanalysed forms by applying the \u201ccalculus\u201d spoken of in the\nPhilosophical Grammar we will finally come to know the names\nand thereby the objects. Presumably, we will know the latter by\nacquaintance in the act of grasping propositions in their final\nanalysed forms.\n\nAdmittedly, Wittgenstein\u2019s denial that we can know the objects\na priori looks strange given the fact that the analytical\nprocedure described in Section 2 above seems to presuppose that we\nhave a priori knowledge both of the correct analyses of ordinary names\nand of the contextual definitions by means of which terms for\ncomplexes are to beeliminated. But some tension in\nWittgenstein\u2019s position on this point is just what we should\nexpect in view of his later rather jaundiced assessment of his earlier\nreliance on the idea of philosophical discovery:\n\nI [used to believe that] the elementary propositions could be\nspecified at a later date. Only in recent years have I broken away\nfrom that mistake. At the time I wrote in a manuscript of my book,\n\u201cThe answers to philosophical questions must never be\nsurprising. In philosophy you cannot discover anything.\u201d I\nmyself, however, had not clearly enough understood this and offended\nagainst it. (WVC, 182, emphasis added)\n\n\nThe remark that Wittgenstein quotes here from \u201ca manuscript of\nthe Tractatus\u201d did not survive into the final version,\nbut its sentiment is clearly echoed in the related remark that there\ncan: \u201cnever be surprises in logic\u201d (6.1251). Wittgenstein\nis clear that in the Tractatus he had unwittingly proceeded\nas though there could be such a thing as a philosophical\nsurprise or discovery. His idea that the true objects would be\ndiscovered through analysis, but are nonetheless not known a\npriori, is plausibly one instance of this mistake.\n\nOn the conception of the Tractatus, objects are to be\ndiscovered by grasping fully analysed propositions, presumably\nwith the awareness that they are fully analysed. But\nsince that is so, we shall not have fully explained how we are\nsupposed to be able to discover the simples unless we explain how, in\npractice, we can know we have arrived at the final analysis of a\nproposition. But on this point, unfortunately, Wittgenstein has little\nto say. In fact, the only hint he offers is the rather dark one\ncontained in Tractatus 3.24: \n\nThat a propositional element signifies [bezeichnet] a complex\ncan be seen from an indeterminateness in the propositions in which it\noccurs. We know that everything is not yet determined by this\nproposition. (The notation for generality contains a prototype).\n(3.24)\n\n\nIt is an indeterminateness in propositions \u2014 whatever this might\namount to \u2014 that is supposed to alert us to the need for further\nanalysis. In Wittgenstein\u2019s view, then, we possess a positive\ntest for analyzability. However, since the notion of\n\u201cindeterminateness\u201d in question is unclear, the test is of\nlittle practical value. The indeterminateness in question is plainly\nnot the one we considered in section 3: what is in question at the\npresent juncture is the indeterminateness of propositions, not of\nsenses. But what does that amount to?\n\nAccording to one line of interpretation, due originally to W. D. Hart\n(Hart 1971), a proposition is indeterminate when there is more than\none way it can be true. Thus if I say \u201cBarack Obama is in the\nUnited States,\u201d I leave open where in particular he might be.\nThe source of the indeterminacy is the implied generality of this\nstatement, which is tantamount to: \u201cObama is somewhere\nin the United States.\u201d This line of interpretation has the merit\nof promising to make sense of the closing parenthetical remark of\n3.24. But it cannot be correct. The kind of indeterminacy that\nWittgenstein has in mind at 3.24 is supposed to serve as a sign of\nfurther analysability. But Hart\u2019s notion cannot play this role,\nsince any disjunctive proposition would be indeterminate in his sense,\neven a fully analysed proposition consisting of a disjunction of\nelementary propositions.\n\nAccording to a second line of interpretation, a proposition is\nindeterminate in the relevant sense if the result of embedding it in\nsome context is structurally ambiguous. Consider, for example, the\nresult of embedding \u201cF [A]\u201d in the\ncontext \u201cit is not true that,\u201d where\n\u2018A\u2019 is temporarily treated as a semantically\nsimple term designating a complex (Keep in place the assumption that a\nsentence containing a non-referring semantically simple term is\nneither true nor false). In this case the question would arise whether\nthe result of this embedding is neither true nor false evaluated with\nrespect to a world in which A does not exist, or simply true.\nThe first option corresponds to giving the apparent name wide scope\nwith respect to the logical operator, the second to giving it narrow\nscope. Such a scope ambiguity could not exist if\n\u2018A\u2019 were a genuine Tractarian name, so its\npresence could reasonably be taken to signal the need for further\nanalysis.\n\nSo far, so good, but where does the business about the generality\nnotation \u201ccontaining a prototype\u201d come in? Nothing in the\npresent explanation has yet done justice to this remark. Nor does the\npresent explanation really pinpoint what it is that signals the need\nfor further analysis. That, at bottom, is the fact that we can imagine\ncircumstances in which the supposed referent of\n\u2018A\u2019 fails to exist. So, again, there is reason to\nbe dissatisfied with this gloss on indeterminacy. \n\nIt is hard to resist the conclusion that Wittgenstein never supplied\nan adequate way of recognizing when a proposition is fully analysed,\nand consequently that he failed to specify a means for recognizing\nsomething as a Tractarian object.\n5. The Dismantling of Logical Atomism\n\nWittgenstein\u2019s turn away from logical atomism may be divided\ninto two main phases. During the first phase (1928\u20139),\ndocumented in his 1929 article \u201cSome Remarks on Logical\nForm\u201d (Klagge and Nordmann, 1993, 29\u201335), Wittgenstein\nexhibits a growing dissatisfaction with certain central details of the\nTractatus\u2019s logical atomism, and notably with the\nthesis of the independence of elementary propositions. During this\nphase, however, he is still working within the broad conception of\nanalysis presupposed, if not fully developed, in the\nTractatus. The second phase (1931\u20132) involves a\nrevolutionary break with that very conception.\n5.1 First phase: The colour-exclusion problem\n\nThe so-called \u201ccolour-exclusion problem\u201d is a difficulty\nthat arises for the Tractatus\u2019s view that it is\nmetaphysically possible for each elementary proposition to be true or\nfalse regardless of the truth or falsity of the others (4.211). In\nview of its generality, the problem might more accurately be termed\n\u201cthe problem of the manifest incompatibility of apparently\nunanalysable statements.\u201d The problem may be illustrated as\nfollows: Suppose that a is a point in the visual field.\nConsider the propositions P: \u201ca is blue at\nt\u201d and Q: \u201ca is red at\nt\u201d (supposing \u201cred\u201d and \u201cblue\u201d\nto refer to determinate shades). It is clear that P and\nQ cannot both be true; and yet, on the face of it, it seems\nthat this incompatibility (or \u201cexclusion\u201d in\nWittgenstein\u2019s parlance) is not a logical\nimpossibility. In the Tractatus Wittgenstein\u2019s\nresponse was to treat the problem as merely apparent. He supposed that\nin such cases further analysis would reveal the incompatibility to be\nlogical in nature:\n\nFor two colours, e.g., to be at one place in the visual field\nis impossible, and indeed logically impossible, for it is excluded by\nthe logical structure of colour. Let us consider how this\ncontradiction presents itself in physics. Somewhat as follows: That a\nparticle cannot at the same time have two velocities, that is, that at\nthe same time it cannot be in two places, that is, that particles in\ndifferent places at the same time cannot be identical (6.3751)\n\n\nAs F. P. Ramsey observes in his review of the Tractatus\n(Ramsey, 1923), the analysis described here actually fails to\nreveal a logical incompatibility between the two statements in\nquestion; for, even granting the correctness of the envisaged\nreduction of the phenomenology of colour perception to facts about the\nvelocities of particles, the fact that one and the same particle\ncannot be (wholly) in two places at the same time still looks very\nmuch like a synthetic a priori truth. It turns out, however,\nthat Wittgenstein was well aware of this point. He knew that he had\nnot taken the analysis far enough to bring out a logical\ncontradiction, but he was confident that he had taken a step in the\nright direction. In a Notebooks entry from August 1916 he\nremarks that: \u201cThe fact that a particle cannot be in two places\nat the same time does look more like a logical impossibility\n[than the fact that a point cannot be red and green at the same time].\nIf we ask why, for example, then straight away comes the thought:\nWell, we should call particles that were in two places [at the same\ntime] different, and this in its turn all seems to follow from the\nstructure of space and particles\u201d (NB, 81; emphasis\nadded). Here Wittgenstein is conjecturing that it will turn\nout to be a conceptual (hence, for him logical) truth about\nparticles and space (and presumably also time) that particles in two\ndistinct places (at the same time) are distinct. He does not yet\npossess the requisite analyses to demonstrate this conjecture, but he\nis optimistic that they will be found. \n\nThe article \u201cSome Remarks on Logical Form\u201d (1929) marks\nthe end of this optimism. Wittgenstein now arrives at the view that\nsome incompatibilities cannot, after all, be reduced to logical\nimpossibilities. His change of heart appears to have been occasioned\nby a consideration of incompatibilities involving the attribution of\nqualities that admit of gradation \u2014 e.g., the pitch of\na tone, the brightness of a shade of colour, etc. Consider, for\nexample, the statements: \u201cA has exactly one degree of\nbrightness\u201d and \u201cA has exactly two degrees of\nbrightness.\u201d The challenge is to provide analyses of these\nstatements that bring out the logical impossibility of their being\ntrue together. What Wittgenstein takes to be the most plausible\nsuggestion \u2014 or at least a sympathetic reconstruction of it\n\u2014 adapts the standard definitions of the numerically definite\nquantifiers to the system described in the Tractatus,\nanalysing these claims as respectively:\n\u201c\u2203x(Bx & A has x)\n& ~\u2203x,y(Bx & By\n& A has x and A has y)\u201d\n(\u201cBx\u201d means \u201cx is a degree of\nbrightness\u201d) and \u201c\u2203x,y(Bx\n& By & A has x and A has\ny) & ~\u2203x,y,z(Bx\n& By & Bz & A has x\n& A has y & A has\nz).\u201d But the suggestion will not do. The trouble is\nthat this analysis \u2014 absurdly \u2014 makes it seem as though\nwhen something has just one degree of brightness there could be a\nsubstantive question about which (if any) of the three mentioned in\nthe analysis of the second claim\u2014 x or y or\nz \u2014 it was\u2014as if a degree of brightness were a\nkind of corpuscle whose association with a thing made it bright (cf.\nKlagge and Nordmann, 33). Wittgenstein concludes that the independence\nof elementary propositions must be abandoned and that terms for real\nnumbers must enter into atomic propositions, so that the impossibility\nof something\u2019s having both exactly one and exactly two degrees\nof brightness emerges as an irreducibly mathematical impossibility.\nThis, in turn, contradicts the Tractatus\u2019s idea that\nall necessity is logical necessity (6.37). \n5.2 Second phase: Generality and Analysis\n\nUnlike Frege and Russell, the Tractatus does not treat the\nuniversal and existential quantifiers as having meaning in isolation.\nInstead, it treats them as incomplete symbols to be analysed away\naccording to the following schemata:\n\n\u2200x. \u03a6x \u2194 \u03a6a &\n\u03a6b & \u03a6c\u2026\n\n\u2203x. \u03a6x \u2194 \u03a6a \u2228\n\u03a6b \u2228 \u03a6c\u2026\n\n\nUniversal (existential) quantification is treated as equivalent to a\npossibly infinite conjunction (disjunction) of propositions.\nWittgenstein\u2019s later dissatisfaction with this view is expressed\nmost clearly in G. E. Moore\u2019s notes of Wittgenstein\u2019s\nlectures from Michaelmas term 1932.\n\nNow there is a temptation to which I yielded in [the]\nTractatus, to say that\n\n\n(x).fx = logical\n product,[9]\nfa . fb . fc\u2026\n\n\n(\u2203x).fx = [logical] sum, fa \u2228\nfb \u2228 fc\u2026\n\n\nThis is wrong, but not as absurd as it looks. (entry for 25 November,\n1932, Stern et. al., 2016,\n 215)[10].\n \n\n\nExplaining why the Tractatus\u2019s analysis of generality\nis not palpably absurd, Wittgenstein says: \n\nSuppose we say that: Everybody in this room has a hat = Ursell has a\nhat, Richards has a hat etc. This is obviously false, because you have\nto add \u201c& a, b, c,\u2026 are\nthe only people in the room.\u201d This I knew and said in [the]\nTractatus. But now, suppose we talk of\n\u201cindividuals\u201d in R[ussell]\u2019s sense, e.g., atoms or\ncolours; and give them names, then there would be no prop[osition]\nanalogous to \u201cAnd a, b, c are the\nonly people in the room.\u201d (ibid.)\n\n\nClearly, in the Tractatus Wittgenstein was not making the\nsimple-minded mistake of forgetting that \u201cEvery F is\nG\u201d cannot be analysed as \u201cGa &\nGb & Gc\u2026\u201d even when a,\nb, c, etc. are in fact the only Fs.\n(Unfortunately, his claim that he registered this point in the\nTractatus is not borne out by the text). His idea was rather\nthat the Tractatus\u2019s analysis of generality is offered\nonly for the special case in which a, b, c,\netc, are \u201cindividuals\u201d in Russell\u2019s sense.\nWittgenstein had supposed that in this case there is no proposition to\nexpress the supplementary clause that is needed in the other cases.\nUnfortunately, Wittgenstein does not explain why there should be no\nsuch proposition, but the answer seems likely to be the following:\nWhat we are assumed to be analysing is actually \u201cEverything is\nG.\u201d In this case any allegedly necessary competing\nclause \u2014 for example, \u201ca, b, c\netc., are the only things\u201d (that is, Tractarian\nobjects) \u2014 would just be a nonsense-string produced in the\nmisfired attempt to put into words something that is shown by\nthe fact that when analysis bottoms out it yields as names only such\nas figure in the conjunction \u201cGa & Gb\n& Gc\u2026\u201d (cf. Tractatus 4.1272).\n\nWhat led Wittgenstein to abandon the Tractatus\u2019s\nanalysis of generality was his realization that he had failed\nadequately to think through the infinite case. He had proceeded as\nthough the finite case could be used as a way of thinking about the\ninfinite case, the details of which could be sorted out at a later\ndate. By 1932 he had come to regard this attitude as mistaken. The\npoint is made in a passage from the Cambridge Lectures whose\nmeaning can only be appreciated after some preliminary explanation.\nThe passage in question makes a crucial claim about something\nWittgenstein refers to as \u201cThe Proposition\u201d. By this\nphrase in this context he means the joint denial of all the\npropositions that are values of the propositional function\n\u201cx is in this room\u201d. This proposition can be\nwritten: \n\n(x is in this room) [- - - - - T]\n\n\n(Entry for November 25th, 1932, Compare Stern et. al, 217)\n Here the symbol \u2018[- - - - - T]\u2019 symbolizes\nthe joint-denial operation, and the whole symbol expresses the result\nof applying this operation to arbitrarily many values of the\npropositional function \u201cx is in the room\u201d. The\ndashes in the symbol for joint denial represent rows in the\ntruth-table on which one or more of the truth-arguments\u2014that is\nvalues of the propositional function\u2014is true. The result of\napplying the operation of joint denial to those truth-arguments is\naccordingly false. (In a variant on this notation each of the dashes\ncould be replaced with \u2018F\u2019). Wittgenstein is interested in\nthe fact that while we write down finitely many dashes we intend the\narguments for the joint-denial operation to be arbitrarily many and\npossibly infinitely many. His criticism of these conceptions runs as\nfollows:\n\n\nThere is a most important mistake in [the] Tract[atus]\u2026I\npretended that the Proposition was a logical product; but it\nisn\u2019t, because \u201c\u2026\u201d don\u2019t give you a\nlogical product. It is [the] fallacy of thinking 1 + 1 + 1 \u2026 is\na sum. It is muddling up a sum with the limit of a sum (ibid.)\n\n\nHis point is that the Proposition does not, despite appearances,\nexpress a logical product. It rather, he now seems to be saying,\nexpresses something like an indefinitely extensible process.\nWittgenstein came to see his earlier hope that it did express a\nlogical product rested on the mistake of confusing \u201cdots of\ninfinitude\u201d with \u201cdots of laziness.\u201d. The upshot\ncould scarely be more important: if Wittgenstein is right, the\nTractatus\u2019s very conception of the general form of the\nproposition, because it makes essential appeal to the idea of the\njoint denial of arbitrarily many values of a propositional function,\nis itself infected with confusion.\n\nWittgenstein, however, does not think that the confusion of kinds of\ndots was the deepest mistake he made in the Tractatus. Beyond\nthis: \u201cThere was a deeper mistake \u2014 confusing logical\nanalysis with chemical analysis. I thought\n\u2018(\u2203x)fx\u2019 is a definite\nlogical sum, only I can\u2019t at the moment tell you which\u201d\n(November 25, 1932, ibid.; cf. PG, 210). Wittgenstein had\nsupposed that there was a fact of the matter \u2014 unknown, but in\nprinciple knowable \u2014 about which logical sum\n\u201c(\u2203x).fx\u201d is equivalent to. But\nbecause he had failed to specify the analytical procedure in full\ndetail, and because he had not adequately explained what analysis is\nsupposed to preserve, this idea was unwarranted. Indeed, it\nexemplified an attitude he was later to characterize as amounting to a\nkind of unacceptable \u201cdogmatism\u201d (WWK, 182).\n", "bibliography": {"categories": ["<a name=\"PriSou\">Primary Sources</a>", "<a name=\"SecSou\">Secondary Sources</a>"], "cat_ref_text": {"<a name=\"PriSou\">Primary Sources</a>": ["</h3>\n<ul class=\"hanging\">", "Kant, I., 1781/1787 [<em>Critique</em>], <em>The Cambridge Edition\nof the Works of Immanuel Kant: Critique of Pure Reason</em>, P.
