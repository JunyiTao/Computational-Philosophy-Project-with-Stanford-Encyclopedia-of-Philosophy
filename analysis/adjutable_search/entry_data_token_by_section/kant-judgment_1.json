    "main_text": "The Nature of Judgment || The power of judgment and the other faculties of cognition\n1.1 The power of judgment and the other faculties of cognition\n\nAccording to Kant, a \u201cjudgment\u201d (Urteil) is a\nspecific kind of \u201ccognition\u201d\n(Erkenntnis)\u2014which he generically defines as any\nconscious mental representation of an object (A320/B376)\u2014that is\nthe characteristic output of the \u201cpower of judgment\u201d\n(Urteilskraft). The power of judgment, in turn, is a\ncognitive \u201ccapacity\u201d (F\u00e4higkeit) but also\nspecifically a spontaneous and innate cognitive\ncapacity, and in virtue of these it is the \u201cfaculty of\njudging\u201d (Verm\u00f6gen zu urteilen) (A69/B94), which\nis also the same as the \u201cfaculty of thinking\u201d\n(Verm\u00f6gen zu denken) (A81/B106).\n\nFor Kant the mind is essentially active and vital\u2014\u201cthe\nmind (Gem\u00fct) for itself is entirely life (the principle\nof life itself)\u201d (5: 278)\u2014and a cognitive capacity in turn\nis a determinate conscious propensity of the mind to generate\nobjective representations of certain kinds under certain conditions.\nWhat do spontaneity and innateness add to a mere capacity for\ncognition, so that it becomes a \u201cfaculty of\ncognition\u201d (Erkenntnisverm\u00f6gen)? A cognitive\nfaculty is spontaneous in that whenever it is externally stimulated by\nraw unstructured sensory data as inputs, it then automatically\norganizes or \u201csynthesizes\u201d those data in an unprecedented\nway relative to those inputs, thereby yielding novel structured\ncognitions as outputs (B1\u20132, A50/B74, B132, B152). So cognitive\nspontaneity is a structural creativity of the mind with\nrespect to its representations. It is a controverted question of\nrecent Kant-interpretation whether cognitive spontaneity derives\nexclusively from the conceptual or discursive capacity of the rational\nhuman mind (B152) (Longuenesse 1998, chs. 1\u20133, 5, 8), or can\nalso derive independently from the intuitional, non-conceptual, or\nsensible capacity of the rational human mind, shared with minded\nnon-rational human or non-human animals (B151) (Hanna 2006b, ch. 1,\nMcLear 2011). Correspondingly, it is also a controverted question\nwhether according to Kant there is only one basic kind of synthesis,\ni.e., conceptual/discursive synthesis, or two basic kinds, i.e.,\nconceptual/discursive synthesis and\nintuitional/non-conceptual/sensible synthesis. These controverted\nquestions, in turn, are closely connected with the recent vigorous\ndebate about Kant\u2019s conceptualism vs. Kant\u2019s\nnon-conceptualism in relation to his theory of judgment, and the\nimplications of this for interpreting and critically evaluating\nKant\u2019s transcendental idealism and the Transcendental Deduction\nof the Pure Concepts of the Understanding, a.k.a. \u201cthe\nCategories\u201d (see the supplementary document\n The Togetherness Principle, Kant\u2019s Conceptualism, and Kant\u2019s Non-Conceptualism\n and Sections 4.1 to 4.2 below). \n\nKant also uses the term \u2018spontaneity\u2019 in a somewhat\ndifferent sense in a metaphysical context, to refer to a mental cause\nthat can sufficiently determine an effect in time while also lacking\nany temporally prior sufficient cause of itself (A445/B473). Call this\npractical spontaneity. What is shared between the two senses\nof spontaneity, practical and cognitive, is the unprecedented,\ncreative character of the mind\u2019s operations. But in the\ncognitive sense of spontaneity, what is crucial is that the sensory\ndata manifest \u201cpoverty of the stimulus\u201d (Cook & Newson\n1996, 81\u201385)\u2014significant underdetermination of the outputs\nof an embodied cognitive capacity by the relevant inputs to that\ncapacity, plus previous experiences or habituation\u2014although the\nfaculty\u2019s spontaneity must also always be minimally conditioned\nby external sensory triggering (B1\u20132). Correspondingly, a\nKantian cognitive faculty is innate in the threefold sense that (i) it\nis intrinsic to the mind, hence a necessary part of the nature of the\nrational animal possessing that faculty, (ii) it contains internal\nstructures that are necessarily or strictly underdetermined by any and\nall sensory impressions and/or empirical facts\u2014which is the same\nas their being a priori (B2), and (iii) it automatically\nsystematically synthesizes those sensory inputs according to special\nnormative rules that directly reflect the internal structures of the\nfaculty, thereby generating its correlatively-structured outputs. So\nKantian innateness is essentially a procedure-based\ninnateness, consisting in an a priori active readiness of the mind for\nimplementing normative rules of synthesis, as opposed to the\ncontent-based innateness of Cartesian and Leibnizian innate\nideas, according to which an infinitely large supply of complete\n(e.g., mathematical) beliefs, propositions, or concepts themselves are\neither occurrently or dispositionally intrinsic to the mind. But as\nLocke pointed out, this implausibly overloads the human mind\u2019s\nlimited storage capacities.\n\nIn contrast to both Rationalists and Empiricists, who hold that the\nhuman mind has only one basic cognitive faculty\u2014reason or sense\nperception, respectively\u2014Kant is a cognitive-faculty\ndualist who holds that the human mind has two basic\ncognitive faculties: (i) the \u201cunderstanding\u201d\n(Verstand), the faculty of concepts, thought, and\ndiscursivity, and (ii) the \u201csensibility\u201d\n(Sinnlichkeit), the faculty of intuitions/non-conceptual\ncognitions, sense perception, and mental imagery (A51/B75). The\nessential difference between the faculties of understanding and\nsensibility, and correspondingly the essential difference between\nconcepts and intuitions (A50\u201352/B74\u201376), as distinct kinds\nof cognition, is a fundamental commitment of Kant\u2019s theory of\ncognition generally and of his theory of judgment more specifically.\nConcepts are at once (a) general representations having the logical\nform of universality (9: 91), (b) discursive representations\nexpressing pure logical forms and falling under pure logical laws\n(A68\u201370/B92\u201394, A239/B298), (c) complex intensions ranging\nover \u201ccomprehensions\u201d (Umfangen) that contain all\nactual and possible objects falling under those intensions, as well as\nother narrower comprehensions (9: 95\u201396), (d) mediate or\nindirect (i.e., attributive or descriptive) representations of\nindividual objects (A320/B376\u2013377), (e) rules for classifying\nand organizing perceptions of objects (A106), and (f)\n\u201creflected\u201d representations expressing the higher-order\nunity of rational self-consciousness, a.k.a.\n\u201capperception\u201d (B133 and 133n.). Intuitions by contrast\nare conscious object-directed representations that are (1) singular\n(A320/B377) (9: 91), (2) sense-related (A19/B33, A51/B75), (3)\nobject-dependent (B72) (4: 281), (4) immediate, or directly\nreferential (A90\u201391/B122\u2013123, B132, B145), and, above all,\n(5) non-conceptual (A284/B340) (9: 99) (Hanna 2001, ch. 4).\n\nUnderstanding and sensibility are both subserved by the faculty of\n\u201cimagination\u201d (Einbildungskraft), which when\ntaken generically is the source or engine of all sorts of synthesis,\nbut which when taken as a \u201cdedicated\u201d or task-sensitive\ncognitive faculty, construed as either \u201cproductive\u201d or\n\u201creproductive,\u201d more specifically generates (\u03b1) the\nspatial and temporal forms of intuition, (\u03b2) novel mental imagery\nin conscious sensory states, (\u03b3) reproductive imagery or\nmemories, and (\u03b4) \u201cschemata,\u201d which are\nsupplementary rules for interpreting general conceptual rules in terms\nof more specific figural (spatiotemporal) forms and sensory images\n(A78/B103, B151, A100\u2013102, A137\u2013142/B176\u2013181) (7:\n167). At least in principle, then, the imagination mediates between\nthe understanding and the sensibility by virtue of being an autonomous\nthird basic cognitive capacity containing elements of each of the\nbasic dual capacities (see,e.g., A115\u2013119 and\nA139\u2013142/B178\u2013181)\u2014which would, in effect, make Kant\na cognitive-capacity trinitarian. But sometimes, contrariwise\nand somewhat incoherently, Kant seems instead to say that the\nimagination at once (i) belongs to sensibility and yet also\n(ii) is caused by the action of the understanding on\nsensibility. This deep unclarity about the nature of the imagination,\nin addition to being a flashpoint for important longstanding\ndisagreements in Kant-scholarship on his theory of judgment (see,\ne.g., Heidegger 1990, Waxman 1991, Longuenesse 1998), also has some\nserious implications for Kant\u2019s theory of judgment itself\n(again, see the supplementary document\n The Togetherness Principle, Kant\u2019s Conceptualism, and Kant\u2019s Non-Conceptualism\n and Sections 4.1 to 4.2 below).\n\nJust as understanding and sensibility are subserved by the\nbottom-up cognitive processing of the imagination, so in turn they are\nalso superserved by the top-down cognitive processing of the\nfaculty of \u201creason\u201d (Vernunft), which produces\nlogical inferences, carries out pragmatic or moral choices and\ndecisions, a.k.a. \u201cpractical judgments\u201d), imposes\ncoherence and consistency on all sorts of cognitions, and above all\nrecognizes and implements strongly modal and categorically normative\nconcepts such as necessary truth and unconditional obligation, in the\nform of lawlike \u201cprinciples\u201d (Principien,\nGrunds\u00e4tze) (A299\u2013304/B355\u2013361,\nA800\u2013804/B828\u2013832).\n\nFinally, the objective unity of any judgment whatsoever is guaranteed\nby the faculty of apperception or rational self-consciousness, which\nplays the \u201cexecutive\u201d role in the corporate organization\nof the mind by introducing a single higher-order unity into all of its\nlower-order representations, via judgment, and whose characteristic\noutput is the cogito-like self-directed judgment-forming\nrepresentation \u201cI think\u201d (Ich denke): as\nin \u201cI think about X\u201d (where X is some\nconcept, say the concept of being a philosopher) or \u201cI think\nthat P\u201d (where that-P is some proposition, say\nthe proposition that Kant is a philosopher) (B131\u2013132). The\nI think according to Kant is \u201cthe vehicle of all\nconcepts and judgments whatever\u201d (A341/B399), because it is both\na necessary condition of the objective unity of every judgment and\nalso automatically implements one or another of a set of primitive\npure a priori logical forms or functions of unity in judgments or\nthoughts\u2014\u201cthe pure concepts of the understanding\u201d or\n\u201ccategories\u201d (A66\u201383/B91\u2013116)\u2014in the\nseveral semantic constituents of that judgment.\n\nThe power of judgment, while a non-basic faculty, is\nnevertheless the central cognitive faculty of the human mind.\nThis is because judging brings together all the otherwise\nuncoordinated sub-acts and sub-contents of intuition,\nconceptualization, imagination, and reason, via apperception or\nrational self-consciousness, for the purpose of generating a single\ncognitive product, the judgment, under the overarching pure concepts\nof the understanding or categories, thereby fully integrating the\nseveral distinct cognitive faculties and their several distinct sorts\nof representational information, and thereby also constituting a\nsingle rational human animal. For Kant then, rational humans are\njudging animals.\n",
