    "main_text": "Further Kinds of Logical Pluralism || Pluralism About the Objects of Logical Consequence\n5.2 Pluralism About the Objects of Logical Consequence\n\nAnother variety of logical pluralism results if we consider that there\nmight be different correct logics for different kinds of truth-bearer,\nas is argued in Russell (2008). Suppose that logical consequence is\nindeed a matter of truth-preservation over cases. Then we could\ncoherently talk of truth-preservation relations on (sets of)\nsentences, on (sets of) propositions, or on (sets of) characters (as\nin Kaplan 1989), and ultimately on any truth-bearer whatsoever. This\nwould not be very exciting if those logics all turned out to determine\na single \u201cparallel\u201d consequence relation, so that, for\nexample, a sentence, \\(S_1\\), had a sentence, \\(S_{2}\\), as a logical\nconsequence if and only if the proposition \\(S_1\\) expressed (namely,\n\\(P_{1}\\)) had the proposition expressed by \\(S_{2}\\) (namely,\n\\(P_{2}\\)) as a logical consequence. Russell uses various examples\ninvolving names, rigidity, direct reference, and indexicals to argue\nthat this is not always the case. To take just one, on the assumption\nthat the sentence \\(a=b\\) contains two different, directly referential\nnames, \\(a=b\\) and \\(a=a\\) express the same proposition. Given the\nminimal assumption that the relation of logical consequence is\nreflexive, that means that proposition expressed by \\(a=b\\) is a\nlogical consequence of the proposition expressed by \\(a=a\\), even\nthough the sentence \\(a=b\\) is not a logical consequence of the\nsentence \\(a = a\\). Hence the relation of logical consequence on\nsentences is interestingly different from that of the relation of\nlogical consequence on propositions, and there are at least two\ndifferent, correct relations of logical consequence.\n",
