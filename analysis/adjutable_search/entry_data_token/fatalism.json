Logical Fatalism: Aristotle\u2019s argument and the nature of truth\n\nThe classic argument for fatalism occurs in Aristotle (384\u2013322\nB.C.E.), De Interpretatione, chapter 9. He addresses the\nquestion of whether in relation to all questions it is necessary that\nthe affirmation or the negation is true or false.\n\nWhat he says could be presented as an argument along the following\nlines.\n\n\nSuppose that (i) p is true or p is false and (ii)\nnot-p is true or not-p is false.\n\nThen p is true or not-p is true.\n\nNow suppose that in 1900 one person says that a sea-battle will take\nplace on 1/1/2100, and another says that a sea-battle will not take\nplace on 1/1/2100.\n\nThen either what the first person says is true or what the second\nperson says is true.\n\nBut, in that case, either it is necessary in 1900 that a sea-battle\ntakes place on 1/1/2100, or it is necessary in 1900 that one does not\ntake place.\n\nBut the date of the predictions is irrelevant, and it is irrelevant\nwhether any prediction is actually made at all.\n\nSo it is necessary at all times that a sea-battle takes place on\n1/1/2100, or that a sea-battle does not take place on 1/1/2100.\n\nBut the argument can evidently be generalised.\n\nSo, everything that happens, happens of necessity.\n\n\nFirst of all we need to be clear about what is meant by\n\u201cnecessity\u201d here. What is at issue here is not logical\nnecessity. It is rather inevitability. When the occurrence of a\nsea-battle on 1/1/2100 is said to be necessary at a certain date, what\nis meant is that at that date nothing can prevent a sea-battle from\ntaking place on 1/1/2100. In particular, no one has the power to\nprevent it. Now Aristotle accepts that \u201cWhat is, necessarily is,\nwhen it is; and what is not, necessarily is not, when it is\nnot.\u201d So, he accepts that, if a sea-battle is actually taking\nplace on 1/1/2100, then on 1/1/2100 it is (in this sense) taking place\nof necessity. Nothing can then stop it happening, because it is\nhappening. What this argument appears to establish, however, is that,\nif a sea-battle takes place on 1/1/2100, not only is it necessary then\nthat a sea-battle takes place on 1/1/2100, but it was always\nnecessary. No one could ever have prevented it. And the same applies\nto everything that can happen. So, in particular, no one ever has the\npower to do anything other that what they actually do.\n\nSo, is there anything wrong with the argument?\n\nWell certainly there is a move which seems to require some\nexplanation: the move from truth to necessity. Why should it follow\nfrom the fact that it was true in 1900 that a sea-battle would take\nplace on 1/1/2100, that it was necessary that it should? This looks,\nindeed, suspiciously like a fallacious move from \u201cOf necessity,\nif it is true that a sea-battle takes place on 1/1/2100, a sea-battle\ntakes place on 1/1/2100\u201d to \u201cIf it is true that a\nsea-battle takes place on 1/1/2100, a sea-battle takes place of\nnecessity on 1/1/2100\u201d. But such suspicions are probably\nill-founded. It is more likely that the move invokes a certain form of\nthe correspondence theory of truth: if what someone says at a certain\ntime is true, then the state of the world at that time must be such as\nto make it true. But since what is, necessarily is when it is, the\nstate of the world will be necessary. So, anything that is true is\nnecessarily true.\n\nHowever, even if this crucial move does not rest on a simple fallacy,\nthe idea that the truth of what someone says is determined by the\nstate of the world at the time is questionable. We shall return to\nthis point.\n1.1 Aristotle\u2019s solution\n\nFirst we should notice Aristotle\u2019s solution. Aristotle is in no\ndoubt that not everything that happens, happens of necessity. He\naccepts indeed (19a23\u20135) that \u201cWhat is, necessarily is,\nwhen it is; and what is not, necessarily is not, when it is\nnot.\u201d But he goes on to say, \u201cBut not everything that is,\nnecessarily is; and not everything that is not, necessarily is\nnot.\u201d So what is his solution? Here it must be said that there\nis more than one view (Aristotle, Categories and De\nInterpretatione, 137\u201342). On one view he rejects the move\nfrom truth to necessity. That may indeed be the right move to make,\nbut in what follows I shall take it that Aristotle actually offers a\ndifferent solution, which, rightly or wrongly, I shall refer to as\n\u201cthe Aristotelian solution\u201d. On this view his solution is\nto deny that it is necessary that the affirmation or the negation is\ntrue or false when this relates to things that do not happen of\nnecessity. That is to say, his solution is that neither what the first\nperson said in 1900 (\u201cThere will be a sea-battle on\n1/1/2100.\u201d) nor what the second person said (\u201cThere will\nnot be a sea-battle on 1/1/2100.\u201d) was true. What each person\nsaid was in fact neither true nor false. So we may represent the\nAristotelian solution as one which rejects the law of bivalence:\n\nThe law of bivalence: every proposition is either true or false.\n\n\nIt is to be rejected in particular in relation to such propositions\nas, \u201cthere will be a sea-battle on 1/1/2100\u201d; that is, in\nrelation to propositions about future contingents, about what is\nneither necessary nor impossible. (For the view that Aristotle does\nnot reject the law of bivalence see Whitaker 1996.)\n\nThough Aristotle does not explicitly say so, it seems that he would\nalso accept that if a sea-battle takes place on 1/1/2100, then what\nthe first person said would then be true, and if it does not, what the\nsecond person said would then be true. So we may represent the\nAristotelian solution as holding the following:\n\nSome propositions are true at some times and not at others.\n\n\nAre there any objections to this solution?\n\nOne objection is that the solution appears to require the rejection of\nthe law of the excluded middle in addition to the law of bivalence.\nNow it is true that it involves the rejection of one form of the\nlaw:\n\nLEM1: in the case of any proposition, p, either p is\ntrue or not-p is true.\n\n\nBut another form of the law is:\n\nLEM2: in the case of any proposition, p, either p or\nnot-p.\n\n\nDoes it involve the rejection of this? One might think it does, on the\ngrounds that \u201cp\u201d is equivalent to\n\u201cp is true\u201d. So LEM1 and LEM2 stand or fall\ntogether. Or one might think like this: \u201cp or\nq\u201d can be true only if either p is true or\nq is true (or both are). But, where p is a\nproposition about a future contingent it is not true, whether the\ncontingent state of affairs comes about or not; neither is its\nnegation true; so the disjunction, \u201cp or\nnot-p\u201d is not true.\n\nAs a matter of fact, though, this is not what Aristotle seems to have\nthought. He says (19a28\u201332):\n\nEverything necessarily is or is not, and will be or will not be; but\none cannot divide and say that one or the other is necessary. I mean,\nfor example: it is necessary for there to be or not to be a sea-battle\ntomorrow; but it is not necessary for a sea-battle to take place\ntomorrow, nor for one not to take place.\n\n\nSo, on the assumption that he would have accepted that \u201cthere\nwill or will not be a sea-battle tomorrow\u201d is equivalent to\n\u201cthere will be a sea-battle tomorrow or there will not be a\nsea-battle tomorrow\u201d, he would, it seems, have accepted LEM2.\nHow could this be? Well, what stops its being true that there will be\na sea-battle tomorrow is that there is nothing yet to determine that\nit is true. But there is something to determine that there will be or\nwill not be a sea-battle tomorrow; in the nature of things one or the\nother must occur. So it is now true that there will be a sea-battle\ntomorrow or there will not be a sea-battle tomorrow.\n\nThis suggests adopting the following rule for determining the\ntruth-value of complex propositions some of whose constituents are\nneither true nor false. One considers in turn each of the possible\nways in which things may turn out, and works out what truth-value the\ncomplex proposition would then have. If it turns out to be true in\nevery case, it is true; if it turns out to be false in every case, it\nis false; otherwise it is neither true nor false (van Fraassen\n1966).\n\nOf course this is not a wholly cost free line to take. Apart from the\nfact that it means that \u201cp\u201d and \u201cp\nis true\u201d are not in general interchangeable, it also creates\nproblems for truth-functionality. We normally think of\n\u201cor\u201d, \u201cand\u201d and \u201cnot\u201d as being\ntruth-functional. That is to say, we think that the truth-values of\n\u201cp or q\u201d, \u201cp and\nq\u201d and \u201cnot-p\u201d are determined by\nthe truth-values of \u201cp\u201d and\n\u201cq\u201d. But if we adopt the Aristotelian solution,\nand accept the way outlined just now of determining the truth-value of\na complex proposition, \u201cor\u201d, for instance, will not be\ntruth functional. In some case \u201cp or q\u201d\nwill be true when neither p nor q is true (when, for\ninstance, \u201cq\u201d is \u201cnot-p\u201d),\nand in some case it will not be (if, say, \u201cp\u201d is\n\u201cthere will be a sea-battle tomorrow\u201d and\n\u201cq\u201d is \u201cthere will be a football match\ntomorrow\u201d). (If one thinks in terms of there being a third\ntruth-value, indeterminacy, say, in addition to truth and falsity, the\nposition will be that, when p and q are both\nindeterminate, sometimes \u201cp or q\u201d is\ntrue, and sometimes it is indeterminate.). Similarly \u201cp\nand q\u201d will be false in the one case and indeterminate\nin the other.\n\nHowever, this objection might not seem very pressing compared with the\nthreat of fatalism. If accepting a lack of equivalence between\n\u201cp\u201d and \u201cp is true\u201d and a\nfailure of truth-functionality for \u201cor\u201d and\n\u201cand\u201d were the only alternative to accepting fatalism,\nmost people would find it easier to accept these theoretical oddities,\nif oddities they are.\n\nBut there is another objection to the Aristotelian solution which\nmakes it harder to accept \u2014 the way we treat bare predictions.\nIf someone had said in 1972, \u201cRed Rum will win the Grand\nNational next year\u201d, surely, we would think, he was right. Not\nright in 1973, but right in 1972. That is to say, surely what he said\nwas true, when he said it; not just later. Of course, we would not\nhave known in 1972 that what he said was true; nor, presumably did he.\nNor, of course would we have supposed that there was anything\ninevitable about the victory; these things, we naturally suppose, are\na matter of chance. But, of course, this objection to the Aristotelian\nsolution is also an objection to the argument for fatalism which was\nbased on the assumption of bivalence. We are, effectively, rejecting\nthe idea that if what someone says at a time is true at that time,\nthen the state of the world at the time must determine that it is\ntrue. What we seem to be quite prepared to accept instead is the idea\nthat for what is said to be true at a time it is sufficient if the\nstate of the world will sometime be such as to determine that\nit is true.\n\nThere is another problem about the theory of truth which the\nAristotelian argument seems to be invoking. If the theory really is\nthat the truth of what is said depends on the state of the world at\nthe time of the saying, does not that raise a problem for statements\nabout the past? Suppose someone says that a dinosaur stood on this\nspot millions of years ago. For this to be true, must the present\nstate of the world be such as to determine that it is? Some people\nhave indeed thought this; and they have thought that, just as some\npropositions that were not true come to be true, so also some that\nwere true cease to be true (\u0141ukasiewicz 1967). But this is even\nfurther from what we are naturally inclined to say. A more attractive\nalternative, if we wished to retain something like this theory of\ntruth, would be to say that what happened in the past counts as part\nof the present state of the world, because the past, like the present,\nis necessary. But it is not clear why that should be enough to make it\npart of the present state of the world. Perhaps it would be better to\ntake the view simply that something is true at a time only if it is\nnecessary at that time. But then we would need some argument for this\nposition which went beyond the simple thought that what is said is\nmade true by the way the world is at the time it is said.\n\nIt is worth noticing some other solutions which are closely related to\nthe Aristotelian solution, but avoid some of the problems.\n1.2 Related solutions\n\n1. (Prior 1967). One could agree with Aristotle that \u201cthere will\nbe a sea-battle tomorrow\u201d is not true, even if it turns out that\nthere is a sea battle; but instead of saying that it is neither true\nnor false, one could say that it is false. What is more, one could say\nthat the negation, \u201cthere will not be a sea-battle\ntomorrow\u201d is true. Then we could retain the law of bivalence,\nand the equivalence between \u201cp\u201d and\n\u201cp is true\u201d. Effectively we would be treating\n\u201cp\u201d as equivalent to \u201cit is necessary that\np\u201d. And we would, no doubt, distinguish between\n\u201cthere will not be a sea-battle tomorrow\u201d, where this is\nthe negation of \u201cthere will be a sea-battle tomorrow\u201d and\n\u201cthere will be no sea-battle tomorrow\u201d which, like\n\u201cthere will be a sea-battle tomorrow\u201d, is false. One might\neven say that \u201cthere will not be a sea-battle tomorrow\u201d is\nambiguous; it could be equivalent to \u201cit is not necessary that\nthere will be sea-battle tomorrow\u201d or it could be equivalent to\n\u201cit is necessary that there will be no sea-battle\ntomorrow\u201d. Certainly it is in favour of this view that one would\nretain the law of bivalence and also the truth-functionality of\n\u201cor\u201d and \u201cand\u201d. But there would be a heavy\nprice to pay. Now we should have to say what the person said about Red\nRum was false.\n\n2. (Lucas 1986) One could make use of Reichenbach\u2019s distinction\nbetween the time of the utterance of a proposition, the time of the\nreference point and the time of the event (Reichenbach 1947). One\ncould then say that the truth of what is said depends not on the state\nof the world at the time of the utterance, but on the state of the\nworld at the time of the reference point. One may then say that the\nreference point of the utterance in 1972 of \u201cRed Rum will win\nthe Grand National next year\u201d is 1973, not 1972. So, it was\ntrue. (Whereas, if someone had said \u201cRed Rum is going to win the\nGrand National next year\u201d, the use of \u201cis going to\u201d\nrather than \u201cwill\u201d might perhaps have meant that the\nreference point was the time of the utterance, rather than the time of\nnext year\u2019s Grand National. So what was said would not have been\ntrue.)\n\n3. (Tooley 1997) One could distinguish between truth at a time, which\ndepends on the state of the world at the time, and truth\nsimpliciter, which does not. One could then allow that the\nprediction about Red Rum was true, as long as we are talking about\ntruth simpliciter. Also, where truth simpliciter was\nat issue, we could retain the law of bivalence and the equivalence\nbetween \u201cp\u201d and \u201cp is\ntrue\u201d.\n1.3 Rejection of the theory of truth\n\nBut finally we should not forget that, even if we wish to retain a\ncorrespondence theory of truth, we can reject the idea that truth\ndepends on the state of the world at the time of the utterance of a\nproposition or even the state of the world at the time of the\nreference point. We can say that it depends on the state of the world\nat the time of the event spoken of; or, more generally, that it\ndepends on the state of the world at the times spoken of, if any\n(Westphal 2006). The solution we prefer is, however, likely to be\nrelated to the view we take about the nature of time.\n1.4 A-theories and B-theories of time\n\nOn a B-theory of time an event\u2019s being past, present or future\nis simply a relational matter; it is simply a matter of its occurring\nat a time which is earlier than, or simultaneous with, or later than\nsome time which is taken as the reference point \u2013 the time at\nwhich I am having this thought, say. On an A-theory, on the other\nhand, that this time (or this event) is now is an absolute (if\ntemporary) fact about it. But, in addition, a B-theory will typically\nhold that all times are equally real, whereas, typically, an\nA-theory will hold either that only the present and the past are real\n(type 1), or that only the present is real (type 2). So, on a\nB-theory, there can be future facts to make propositions about the\nfuture true; but, on an A-theory of type 1, a proposition about the\nfuture can be made true only by present and past facts together with\ntimeless facts; and, on an A-theory of type 2, propositions both about\nthe future and about the past, can be made true only by present facts\ntogether with timeless facts. And, evidently, on either type of\nA-theory a proposition may be true at one time, but not true at\nanother, depending on what facts exist at the time. (For a fuller\ndescription of the A-theory and B-theory, see the Section 5 of the\nentry on\n time.)\n Suppose, then, that we hold a correspondence view of truth, and that\nwe espouse a version of the A-theory of time which says that there are\nno future facts. In that case we will naturally be attracted by the\nAristotelian solution. If, on the other hand, we espouse a version of\nthe B-theory which allows that there are future facts, we will\nnaturally reject this solution.\n\n1.5 Truth and fatalism\n\nAristotle\u2019s problem seemed to have arisen as a result of a\ntheory of truth according to which, if a statement is true at a time,\nthere has to be a state of the world at that time which makes it true.\nHowever, it has been argued that, if every meaningful statement is\neither true or false (once and for all), that alone implies fatalism;\nthe very fact that a statement is true is enough to make what it\ndescribes unavoidable (Taylor 1983, Chapter 6). Suppose, for example,\nthat John shaved one morning. Then the statement, \u201cJohn shaved\nthat morning\u201d, is true. But, it is argued, that means that John\ndid not have the power not to shave; because to have that power would\nbe to have the power to render a true statement false. But no one has\nsuch a power; no one has ever succeeded in making a true statement\nfalse.\n\nNow the final claim is certainly true, on the assumption that\nmeaningful statements have just one truth-value. No one has ever\nbrought about a situation in which a statement which was true is\nfalse; that is, a situation in which (a) there is a statement which\nwas true and (b) that statement is now false. However, to have the\npower to render a true statement false, one does need to have the\npower to bring about such a situation. It is enough that (a) there\nshould be a statement which is true, and that one has the power merely\nto bring about a situation in which (b) that statement is (and always\nwas) false instead. So for John to have had the power to\nrender false the true statement, \u201cJohn shaved that\nmorning\u201d, it is enough that he should have had the power not to\nshave instead of shaving. Of course, he did not exercise that power;\nbut, in the absence of some other argument to the contrary, presumably\nhe could have done; in which case he would have made the statement,\n\u201cJohn shaved that morning\u201d false instead of true. So, it\nseems that there is no simple move from truth to fatalism.\n2. Logical fatalism: Diodorus Cronus and the necessity of the past\n\nDiodorus Cronus (late 4th \u2013 early 3rd centuries B.C.E.) had an\nargument for fatalism, known as \u201cThe Master Argument\u201d. Its\nconclusion was, \u201cthe possible is that which either is or will\nbe\u201d. We know the premisses but, unfortunately we do not know the\nintermediate steps. The premisses were (1) \u201cEverything that is\npast and true is necessary\u201d, (2) \u201cThe impossible does not\nfollow from the possible\u201d (Kneale and Kneale 1962, 119).\n\nI shall not try to reconstruct the way the argument actually went, but\nconsider an argument to it which might have been akin, which argues\nfor fatalism on the basis of the necessity of the past. The argument\ngoes:\n\n\nWhat is true of the past is necessary.\n\nSuppose that there is a sea-battle on 1/1/2100.\n\nThen it was true in 1900 that there would be a sea-battle on\n1/1/2100.\n\nThen it was true of the past that there would be a sea-battle on\n1/1/2100.\n\nSo it is necessary that there will be a sea-battle on 1/1/2100.\n\nTherefore, if there is a sea-battle on 1/1/2100, it is necessary that\nthere will be a sea-battle on 1/1/2100 (and impossible that there\nshould not be).\n\n\nIs anything wrong with this argument?\n2.1 An Aristotelian solution\n\nWe could certainly make an Aristotelian objection to the argument. We\ncould deny that if a sea-battle takes place on 1/1/2100, it was true\nin 1900 that a sea-battle would take place.\n2.2 An Ockhamist solution\n\nWe could also question either the first premiss or the application of\nit.\n\nIs what is true of the past necessary? Well certainly pretty well\neveryone thinks that what happened in the past cannot be undone. The\npast cannot now be altered. For if one were to undo the past, that\nwould mean that something which did happen did not happen; or, at the\nvery least, that it was true that something happened and then later\nwas not true that it happened. Most people (but not such a large\nmajority) also think that something else is impossible, namely\naffecting what happened in the past or causing something to have\nhappened in the past. (This is not the same thing, of course, as\naltering the past. If one caused something to have happened, one would\nnot thereby bring it about that something that did not happen did\nhappen.) But it is one thing to think that one cannot make it true\nthat there was a sea-battle yesterday, and quite another thing to\nthink that one cannot make it true yesterday that there will be a\nsea-battle tomorrow.\n\nThis might be called the Ockhamist solution to the problem. What\nOckham (c1285\u20131347) says is:\n\nSome propositions are about the present as regards both their wording\nand their subject matter (secundum vocem et secundum rem).\nWhere such [propositions] are concerned, it is universally true that\nevery true proposition about the present has [corresponding to it] a\nnecessary one about the past\u2026 Other propositions are about the\npresent as regards their wording only and are equivalently about the\nfuture, since their truth depends on propositions about the future.\n(Ockham, Predestination, God\u2019s Foreknowledge and Future\nContingents, 46\u20137)\n\n\nIn the spirit of this we may say that some propositions about the past\nare really (at any rate in part) about the future. And in these cases\nthey are not necessary. And we may then apply this to \u201cit was\ntrue in 1900 that there would be a sea-battle on 1/1/2100.\u201d\nThis, we may say, is (in part) really about 1/1/2100.\n\nPropositions which are in this way verbally about one time,\nt, but are really (in part) about a later time, are often\nsaid to express \u201csoft facts\u201d about t.\nUnfortunately it is not at all clear quite how the notion of a soft\nfact should be made precise. One might, for instance, say that if a\nproposition about t logically entails a proposition about a\nlater time, it expresses a soft fact about t. But if that is\nthe correct account, it seems that many propositions expressing soft\nfacts about the past will be necessary, even when they are partly\nabout the future. For instance, a proposition which conjoins some\nplausibly necessary proposition about the past with a law of nature to\nthe effect that in these circumstances something in the future will\nensue would seem to entail something about the future; but since it is\na conjunction of two plausibly necessary propositions, it seems to be\nnecessary itself.\n\nHowever it seems there is one variety of proposition which presumably\nexpresses a soft fact about the past, but is very plausibly not\nnecessary, namely a proposition which is equivalent to a conjunction\nwhere one of the conjuncts is plausibly wholly about the future, and\nwhere the other conjunct does not entail it. And, if the Aristotelian\nsolution is wrong, our example seems to fit this bill. The\nproposition, \u201cit was true in 1900 that there would be a\nsea-battle on 1/1/2100\u201d is plausibly equivalent to \u201cthere\nwas such a time as 1900 and there will be a sea-battle on\n1/1/2100.\u201d And this proposition will not be necessary, if it is\nnot necessary that there will be a sea-battle on 1/1/2100.\n\nNotice that this does not show that the fatalist is wrong. It could\nstill be that the proposition that there will be a sea-battle on\n1/1/2100 is necessary. But it does seem to show that this\nargument does not show that fatalism is correct. The position seems to\nbe that, either the argument does not work, because the Aristotelian\nsolution is correct, or the argument does not work because, in the\nabsence of an independent reason to suppose that the proposition that\nthere will be a sea-battle on 1/1/2100 is necessary, we have no reason\nto suppose that the proposition, \u201cit was true in 1900 that there\nwould be a sea-battle on 1/1/2100\u201d is a necessary\nproposition.\n3. Logical fatalism: Richard Taylor\u2019s argument and the conditions of power\n\nRichard Taylor argues that certain commonly accepted presuppositions\nyield a proof of fatalism (Taylor 1962). The presuppositions are:\n\n\n1. Any proposition whatever is either true, or if not true, false.\n\n2. If any state of affairs is sufficient for, though logically\nunrelated to, the occurrence of some further condition at the same\ntime or any other time, then the former cannot occur without the\nlatter occurring also.\n\n3. If the occurrence of any condition is necessary for, though\nlogically unrelated to, the occurrence of some other condition at the\nsame time, or any other time, then the latter cannot occur without the\nformer occurring also.\n\n4. If one condition or set of conditions is sufficient for (ensures)\nanother, then the other is necessary (essential) for it, and\nconversely, if one condition or set of conditions is necessary\n(essential) for another, then that other is sufficient for (ensures)\nit.\n\n5. No agent can perform any given act if there is lacking, at the same\ntime or any other time, some condition necessary for the occurrence of\nthat act.\n\n6. Time is not by itself \u201cefficacious\u201d; that is, the mere\npassage of time does not augment or diminish the capacities of\nanything and, in particular, it does not enhance or decrease an\nagent\u2019s powers or abilities.\n\n\nHe then produces an argument to show (what most of us believe) that\neither it is not in my power to read a headline saying that there was\na sea-battle yesterday or it is not in my power to read a headline\nsaying that there was no sea-battle yesterday, at any rate if we make\nsome obvious assumptions about the relation between the headlines and\nwhat took place. Letting S be the act of reading a headline\nthat there was a sea-battle, and S\u2032 be the act of\nreading a headline that there was no sea-battle; and letting\nP and P\u2032 be the propositions that there was\nand was not such a battle, the argument goes:\n\nIf P is true, then it is not in my power to do\nS\u2032 (for if P is true, then there is, or was,\nlacking a condition essential for my doing S\u2032, the\ncondition, namely, of there being no sea-battle yesterday).\n\n\nBut if P\u2032 is true, then it is not in my power to do\nS (for a similar reason).\n\nBut either P is true or P\u2032 is true\n\nSo, either it is not in my power to do S or it is not in my\npower to do S\u2032.\n\n\nThe argument, he claims is sound, given the six presuppositions.\n\nBut suppose, his argument continues, we let O and\nO\u2032 be the act of ordering a sea-battle and the act of\nordering no sea-battle, and Q and Q\u2032 be the\npropositions that there will and will not be such a battle; and we\nsubstitute O and O\u2032 for S and\nS\u2032, and Q and Q\u2032 for P\nand P\u2032, and \u201ctomorrow\u201d for\n\u201cyesterday\u201d in the argument above, then (if we make some\nobvious assumptions about the relation between what we order and what\nhappens) we have a parallel argument which goes:\n\nIf Q is true, then it is not in my power to do\nO\u2032 (for if Q is true, then there is, or will\nbe, lacking a condition essential for my doing O\u2032, the\ncondition, namely, of there being no sea-battle tomorrow).\n\n\nBut if Q\u2032 is true, then it is not in my power to do\nO (for a similar reason).\n\nBut either Q is true or Q\u2032 is true\n\nSo, either it is not in my power to do O or it is not in my\npower to do O\u2032.\n\n\nAnd this argument seems equally sound. And evidently it can be\ngeneralised to yield the fatalist conclusion that it is never in our\npower to do anything other than what we actually do.\n\nAre there any objections to his argument?\n\nWell, one might certainly object to presupposition 6, on the grounds\nthat it does indeed seem to be the passage of time which makes a\ndifference to my power to bring about or prevent a sea-battle on a\ncertain day. Till the day is over, I may have the power, but after the\nday, I have not. However, presupposition 6 does not in fact seem to\nplay a significant role in the parallel arguments. So that cannot be\nthe whole story.\n3.1 An Aristotelian solution\n\nThe objection that Taylor himself suggests is the Aristotelian one: we\nreject presupposition 1 (and also, presupposition 6, since we embrace\nthe idea that a proposition may fail to be either true or false at one\ntime and come to be true or false later, as a result of the mere\npassage of time). We would also, presumably, need to amend\npresupposition 5, so that it was not the lack of a necessary condition\nfor an act which was problematical, but the existence of a condition\nwhich was sufficient for the non-performance of the act.\n\nIs that the only objection? Must we accept the Aristotelian solution\nif we wish to escape the fatalistic conclusion?\n3.2 The conditions of power\n\nIt seems that there is an alternative to the Aristotelian solution,\nbecause Taylor\u2019s presupposition 5 seems dubious. A symptom of\nthis is that it seems to yield the fatalist conclusion a bit too\neasily. For supposing that I do not perform act S (whatever\nit is), then it follows immediately that there is lacking a necessary\ncondition for my performing S, namely the occurrence of\nS. So, if presupposition 5 is right, it follows immediately\nthat I never have the power to perform any act which I do not actually\nperform. Of course, that does not show that this conclusion is wrong;\nbut it enough to make one question the presupposition which entails\nit. And one might suggest that not only is this presupposition false,\nbut that it seems true because it is easily confused with another much\nmore plausible proposition (equivalent to Hasker\u2019s PEP5; see\nHasker 1989, 115):\n\n5\u2032. No agent can perform any given act if there is lacking, at\nthe same time or any other time, some condition which is necessary for\nthe occurrence of that act and which it is not in his power to\nbring about.\n\n\nAnd if we substitute that for Taylor\u2019s presupposition 5, the\nparallel argument is no longer sound.\n4. The necessity of the past and Aristotelian solutions\n\nIt is possible, it seems, to reply to the arguments for fatalism which\nwe have considered so far, without appealing to the Aristotelian\nsolution. We can reject the theory of truth which is crucial to\nAristotle\u2019s argument; we can reject the idea that all statements\nwhich are about the past are necessary; we can reject Taylor\u2019s\naccount of the conditions of power. And we can do this without\nquestioning the idea that we cannot affect the past, except, at any\nrate, in the rather ill-defined collection of cases to which Ockham\ndraws our attention. However, it is open to the fatalist to argue that\nwe have no good reason for making the distinction we do between\naffecting the past and affecting the future. So, if we accept that we\ncannot affect the past, we ought also to accept that we cannot affect\nthe future. Of course, this cuts both ways. We might equally come to\nthe conclusion, in the absence of a good reason for making the\ndistinction, that since we can affect the future we can also affect\nthe past; or, if that seems outrageous, we could affect the past if\nnatural laws did not prevent our doing so.\n\nThis objection by the fatalist is surely right about one thing.\nIf we cannot affect the past, it would be good to know\nwhy we cannot. One possible answer would be that which an\nA-theorist of time might give, namely that there is a fundamental\nontological difference between the future on the one hand and the\npresent and past on the other, which consists in the fact that the\npresent and past are real or actual, while the future is not. And it\nis this fact, that the future is not real or actual, which means that\nit is open, can be affected by what happens now; and it is the fact\nthat the present and past are real or actual which means that they\ncannot be affected by what happens now (Lucas 1989a, Tooley 1997).\n\nSuch accounts, as we have noted above, seem to support the\nAristotelian solution. But they are not the only accounts. On some\naccounts there is no such fundamental ontological difference between\nthe future and the present and past; the impossibility of affecting\nthe past lies not in the fact that the passage of time puts a\nconstraint on what can be caused, but rather in the fact that it is\nthe direction of causation which determines the direction of time\n(Swinburne 1994, Mellor 1981 and 1998). On yet other accounts the\nimpossibility is simply a fundamental metaphysical fact which is not\nopen to further analysis or explanation.\n\nIt is, of course, possible that the fatalist challenge about the\ndifference between the future and the present and past cannot be\nsuccessfully met. For instance, it could be argued (a) that the only\nsuccessful answer would be one which appealed to a fundamental\nontological distinction between the future and the present and past,\nbut that (b) there is in fact no such distinction (Shanks 1994;\ndiscussed in Oaklander 1998). But, as we have noted, even if this\nchallenge cannot be met, it does not show that the fatalist is\ncorrect. The possibility remains that we can, in principle, affect the\npast.\n5. Theological Fatalism: Pike\u2019s argument and God\u2019s omniscience\n\nA problem which has been much discussed by philosophers, at least\nsince the time of Augustine (354\u2013430), is whether divine\nomniscience is compatible with free will, and in particular with our\nhaving the power to do other than we do.\n\nOne way of arguing for this incompatibility is due to Pike (Pike\n1965).\n\n\nLet us suppose that being omniscient involves being infallible, and\nbelieving that p if and only if it is true that\np.\n\nLet us also suppose that God existed in 1900, and that omniscience is\npart of his essence.\n\nNow, suppose that Jones mowed his lawn on 1/1/2000.\n\nThen God believed in 1900 that Jones would mow his lawn on\n1/1/2000.\n\nDid Jones have the power to refrain from mowing his lawn?\n\nNo. Because that would mean either (1) that he had the power to do\nsomething which would have brought it about that God had a false\nbelief in 1900, or (2) that he had the power to do something which\nwould have brought it about that God did not believe in 1900 that\nJones would mow his lawn on 1/1/2000, or (3) that he had the power to\ndo something which would have brought it about that God did not exist\nin 1900. And each of these alternatives is impossible.\n\n\nAre there any objections to this argument?\n\nNaturally it would be possible to object to some of the suppositions\nabout the existence and nature of God. I will return to them.\n\nFirst we should notice that the argument depends on a certain\nprinciple about power which is very similar to the plausible amended\nversion of Taylor\u2019s presupposition 5:\n\nIf it is in S\u2019s power to do something which would bring\nit about that p, and p entails q, and\nq is false, then it is in S\u2019s power to do\nsomething which would bring it about that q .\n\n\nThis seems plausible. One might, though, prefer to avoid all mention\nof bringing about, and to rephrase the argument in terms of\ncounterfactuals. So, one would say instead, \u201c\u2026that would\nmean either (1) that he had the power so to act that God would have\nhad a false belief in 1900, or \u2026\u201d (Fischer 1989,\n8\u201311) However, the argument seems at least as plausible when\nrephrased in this way.\n\nSince, given Pike\u2019s assumptions about the existence and nature of\nGod, it would have been impossible for Jones to act in such a way\nthat God would have had a false belief or would not have existed, we\ncan confine our attention to the question of whether he had the power\nso to act that God would not have believed in 1900 that he would mow\nthe lawn on 1/1/2000.\n\nPlantinga (1974a, Part 1, b) claims that the argument\nfails to show that Jones did not have the power to refrain from\nmowing since there is a possible world in which he refrained from\nmowing, and so a possible world in which he acted in such a way\nthat God would not have believed that he would mow. Pike\nreplies (Pike 1977) that the fact that there is such a\npossible world is not enough to show that Jones had the power to\nrefrain; he cites the fact that there is a possible world in which he\njumps ten feet, but says that that does not mean that he has the power\nto jump ten feet.\n\nIt seems that, if Plantinga were right, there would be a ready answer\nto the claim that powerlessness to do anything other than what we\nactually do follows from causal determnism; in particular to the\nclaim that, if Jones\u2019s mowing were causally determined by\ncircumstances, natural or supernatural, prior to his birth, he would\nnot have the power to refrain. The answer would be that there was a\npossible world in which the circumstances before his birth were such\nas not to prevent Jones from mowing.\n\nHowever, it is beyond the scope of this entry to discuss the question\nof whether the power to do anything other than what we actually do is\ncompatible with causal determinism. Let us, therefore, consider\nwhether there is any other reason for thinking that Jones might\nhave had the power to act in such a way that God would not have\nbelieved that he would mow the lawn on 1/1/2000.\n5.1 An Aristotelian solution\n\nOne might object to the conclusion that God believed in 1900 that\nJones would mow his lawn on 1/1/2000, on the grounds that propositions\nabout future contingents are not true. So if God is omniscient in the\nway assumed, he would not hold this belief.\n5.2 An Ockhamist solution\n\nOckham\u2019s answer to the problem of divine foreknowledge was to\ninvoke the difference between propositions which are really about the\npast (those that express \u201chard\u201d facts about the past) and\nthose which are verbally about the past but which are really in part\nabout the future (those that express \u201csoft\u201d facts about\nthe past). The crucial point was that, even if someone lacked the\npower to do something inconsistent with a hard fact about the past,\none might have the power to do something inconsistent with a soft fact\nabout the past. To make such a solution work in the case of the\nproblem posed by Pike\u2019s argument, it would be necessary to show,\nor at any rate to make it plausible, that to act in a way which was\ninconsistent with God\u2019s belief that Jones would mow the lawn in\n1/1/2000 was in fact open to Jones, because what he would be\nbringing about would be inconsistent with a soft fact about the past,\nnot a hard fact. The difficulty for this strategy, though, is to give\nan account of soft facts about the past, or at least a species of soft\nfacts about the past, which meets two conditions: (1) it makes it true\nthat what Jones would be bringing about would be inconsistent with a\nsoft fact of the right sort, and also (2) it is such that it is\nplausible (at any rate in advance of any fatalist proofs to the\ncontrary) that in the case of soft facts of that sort it is in\nprinciple possible at a later date to bring things about which are\ninconsistent with them. (The Introduction to Fischer 1989, and many of\nthe articles in it are relevant to these issues.)\n\nIt is easy enough to give an account of soft facts which fails,\napparently, to meet the second condition. For instance we might say\nthat the following makes it a soft fact that God believes that\nJones will mow the lawn: given the nature of God, the fact that God\nbelieves that Jones will mow the lawn entails and is entailed\nby the fact that Jones will mow the ;awn. But that would not help\nus to see how it would be possible to act in a way which is\ninconsistent with a soft fact of this sort, if we did not already have\nan answer to Pike\u2019s argument. \n\nIt is also, as we have seen in connexion with logical fatalism, easy\nenough to delineate a species of soft facts about the past\nwhich meet the second condition. We have already met an example\nof one such species: \u201cit was true in 1900 that there would be a\nsea-battle on 1/1/2100.\u201d Another example is: \u201cit was true in 1900\nthat Jones would mow the lawn in 1/1/2000.\u201d These are cases where the\ntruth of the propositons is constituted, in part, by a fact about\nthe future. But it is difficult to see how the truth that God\nbelieves that Jones will mow the lawn is constituted, in part, by the\nfact that Jones mows the lawn. Another species of soft fact that would\nmeet the second condition is exemplified by, \u201cthe construction of\nStonehenge predated Jones\u2019s mowing of the lawn.\u201d The truth of this is\nconstitued by a relation the first element of which does not\nnecessitate the second element, and the second element of which\nis a future event (the relation of temporal prioriy, of course).\nBut it is difficult to see how the truth that God believes that Jones\nwill mow the lawn is constituted by a relation which something bears\nto Jones\u2019s mowing without necessitating it.\n\nThis is not to say that there could not be a solution in terns of soft\nfacts, but it is not at all obvious what such a solution would look\nlike.\n\nOf course, the prospects of providing a solution would be satisfying\nif it could be made plausible that in some cases it is in\npeople\u2019s powers to do things which are inconsistent with\nhard facts about the past, not just soft facts. But to take\nthat approach is, in effect, to abandon the idea of an Ockhamist\nsolution, and to move on to the next solution.\n5.3 Affecting the past\n\nOne possible solution is to suggest that Pike\u2019s second\nalternative is possible, without any appeal to softness of facts.\nAccording to this solution, in some cases people have the power do\nthings which are inconsistent with the actual facts about the past,\neven though they are hard facts. That is to say, in some cases people\nhave the power to affect the past. In particular the suggestion is\nthat Jones had the power to do something which would have brought it\nabout that God did not believe in 1900 that he would mow the lawn\n(Anglin 1990). The plausibility of such a solution will depend largely\non the strength of the arguments for the impossibility of affecting\nthe past.\n\nNow some such arguments seek merely to demonstrate this impossibility\nwithout offering any further explanation for it. And it may be\ncontended that most of the arguments of this sort which are at all\ncompelling involve appealing to the obvious impossibility that an\nevent might prevent its own occurrence, and to the slightly less\nobvious impossibility that an event might bring about its own\noccurrence. But, in reply to such arguments, it may be claimed that\nthese impossibilities are not sufficient to rule out the possibility\nthat one event might bring about an earlier event, as long as the\nworld is so organised as to avoid these impossible outcomes. If so, it\nis not clear why God should not have so organised it. And in\nparticular it is not clear why God should not have so organised things\nthat it is possible for us to do things which affect what beliefs he\nholds.\n\nHowever, as we have seen, other arguments for the impossibility of\naffecting the past go further, and incorporate an explanation for the\nimpossibility. A successful defence against theological fatalism which\nappealed to the possibility of affecting the past would have to deal\nwith these further issues.\n5.4 A Boethian solution\n\nBoethius (c480\u2013524) offered a solution to the problem which in\neffect denied the supposition that God existed in 1900 or believed\nanything in 1900 (Boethius, The Consolation of Philosophy,\nBook V). God is, on this view, outside time; he is timelessly eternal.\nThomas Aquinas (1225\u201374) also offered this solution (Aquinas,\nSumma Theologica, Article 13). The idea behind the solution\nis, of course, that if God\u2019s knowledge is not temporal there is\nno reason why Jones should not have the power to bring it about that\nGod knows that he refrains from mowing the lawn on 1/1/2000 instead of\nknowing that he mows the lawn then, since possessing that power would\nnot require having the power to affect the past.\n\nThere may be a number of problems about whether a personal God could\nbe timeless, and how, if at all, he could relate to a temporal world,\nbut it is worth noting one particular problem. The problem is that,\nalthough this solution does not appeal to the possibility of affecting\nthe past, it may be vulnerable to some of the considerations which\nwould tell against that possibility. For suppose that we are unable to\naffect the past, and that the explanation for this inability is that,\nwhereas the future is not real, not actual, the past and present are\nreal and actual. Then it would seem that we would not be able to\naffect a timeless God\u2019s beliefs because, not being future, they\nwould be as real as any past beliefs (Adams 1987, 1135; Zagzebski\n1991, 61). Or suppose instead that the explanation for our inability\nto affect the past is that, if our action brings anything about, that\nin itself would constitute our action\u2019s being earlier than the\nthing brought about. Then it might seem that the idea that we could\nbring about a timeless belief would have to be dismissed; the very\nfact that a belief was brought about would make it later than whatever\nbrought it about, and so not timeless. (Though there would be some\nlogical space, perhaps, for a view that, whereas it was true of\ntemporal events that, if they were brought about, they must\nbe later than what brought them about, this was not true of events in\ngeneral.)\n\nOf course, such considerations need not be fatal to the Boethian\nsolution, because the view that the future is unreal, and the view\nthat the temporal order is determined by the causal order are both\ncontroversial. What it does seem to mean, though, is that there is\nless room than one might have supposed for the success of the solution\nif it is impossible to affect the past.(Rice 2006)\n\nIt is worth noticing a further potential awkwardness for the Boethian\nsolution. If it is really impossible to affect the past, then, even if\nthe Boethian solution would mean that God could know that Jones would\nmow the lawn on 1/1/2000 without compromising Jones\u2019s power to\nrefrain, he could not, on the basis of this knowledge, bring about\nevents in the world before 1/1/2000, which he would not have brought\nabout if Jones had refrained; for if he did, this would mean that\nJones had the power so to act that things would have been different\nbefore 1/1/2000; that is, he would have had the power to affect the\npast.\n5.5 The nature of God\u2019s knowledge\n\nPike\u2019s argument rests on the supposition that God\u2019s\nomniscience involves having beliefs. But this may be questioned\n(Alston 1986). Instead his knowledge, in particular of our actions,\nmay be thought of as Russellian acquaintance knowledge; that is, as\nconsisting of a simple cognitive relation between the knower and what\nis known (Russell 1912, Chapter 5). The idea would be that, although\nin humans acquaintance knowledge gives rise to beliefs, God has just\nthe cognitive relation to what he knows, without any consequent\nbeliefs. This seems to have been the way Boethius and Aquinas thought\nof it (Boethius, The Consolation of Philosophy, Book V, Prose\n6; Aquinas, Summa Theologica, Article 13).\n\nHow would this view about God\u2019s knowledge affect the question of\nwhether divine omniscience entails fatalism?\n\nBoth Boethius and Aquinas thought of God as outside time, but this\nview about God\u2019s knowledge could also be combined with the view\nthat he is inside time. In that case it seems that it would be be\npossible to adopt an Ockhamist account of how his knowledge in 1900\nmight be dependent on what Jones does on 1/1/2000. Certainly it looks\nas if \u201cGod was aware in 1900 of Jones\u2019s mowing the lawn on\n1/1/2000\u201d is partly about 1/1/2000. And \u201cwas aware of\u201d like\n\u201cpredated\u201d expresses a relation the first element of which does not\nnecessitate the second. We should notice, however, that the same\nawkwardness could arise in connection with God\u2019s use of\nhis knowledge as arose for the Boethian solution. If it is\nimpossible to affect the past, then God could not make use of his\nknowledge that Jones would mow the lawn on 1/1/2000 to bring something\nabout before that date, if Jones had the power to refrain from\nmowing.\n\nThere is no reason, of course, why this account of the nature of\nGod\u2019s knowledge should not be combined with the view that the\nfuture is unreal. In that case God would not come to know of\nJones\u2019s mowing of the lawn before 1/1/2000, because there would\nas yet be no fact for him to be aware of. But this would not\ncompromise his omniscience, since, presumably, on this account of\nknowledge, omniscience would be a matter of knowing all the facts.\n\nFor that matter, the account could also be combined with both the view\nthat God is outside time and the view that the future is unreal\n\u2014 as long as these two views themselves are indeed compatible.\nIn that case it would not be true before 1/1/2000 that God timelessly\nknows the Jones mows the lawn, but would be true on 1/1/2000 and\nthereafter. Of course, a timeless being cannot change, but this would\nnot involve a change in God, but merely a change in what he is related\nto. (The number 10 does not change when I refer to it.)\n5.6 Must God be omniscient?\n\nOf course the threat of fatalism, when it arises from God\u2019s\nexistence, could be averted by denying that God exists. But it could\nalso be averted by denying that God needs to be thought of as\nomniscient \u2014 at any rate if omniscience involves infallible\nknowledge of all facts. It could be argued that God\u2019s perfection\ndoes not require the infallible knowledge of all facts, but at most\nsuch knowledge of all facts that could possibly be known infallibly.\nSo, if it is logically impossible for someone to have infallible\nknowledge that Jones will mow the lawn and for Jones to have the power\nto refrain, it is no imperfection in God if he lacks such knowledge\n(Swinburne 1977, 172\u20138). It could also be argued that there is\nno need to attribute infallible knowledge to God at all (Lucas 1986\nand 1989b).\n6. Theological Fatalism: Molina, Plantinga and middle knowledge\n\nSome philosophers, notably Luis de Molina (1535\u20131600) and Alvin\nPlantinga, have held that God knows not only what actual people will\nfreely do in the future, but what each possible free creature would\nhave freely done in each set of possible circumstances, if fully\nspecific; and that he had this knowledge at the creation. (An action\nis free in the required sense if not causally determined and not\npredetermined by God.) Propositions about what a creature would do in\na set of circumstances (possible as well as actual) are commonly\ncalled \u201ccounterfactuals of freedom\u201d, and God\u2019s\nknowledge of them is called \u201cmiddle knowledge\u201d (Molina,\nOn Divine Foreknowledge (Part IV of the Concordia); Plantinga\n1974, IX).\n\nIf God\u2019s knowledge of actual future actions would constitute a\nfatalistic threat, his middle knowledge could not be less threatening,\nsince, given middle knowledge, he would have knowledge of actual\nactions on the basis of his knowledge of the circumstances. In fact it\nseems that it is more threatening.\n\nOf course, one way of avoiding the threat would be to deny that there\nare in general any facts about what people would have freely done in\ncircumstances that have not actually arisen; there may be facts about\nwhat they might have done, or what they would very probably have done;\nbut not what they would have done (Adams 1977; Hasker 1989,\n20\u20139). Indeed this seems to be quite plausible if we really\nthink of people\u2019s actions as undetermined. It may help us to see\nthis if we consider the tossing of a coin. Let us suppose that a coin\nis tossed on some occasion, and it comes down heads; and suppose we\nthen ask if it would have come down heads again if we had tossed it\nagain in exactly the same circumstances. It seems plausible, if we\nthink that how it landed was undetermined, that the right answer is\nthat it might have come down heads and it might have come down tails,\nbut that it is not the case that it would have come down heads, nor\nthe case that it would have come down tails.\n\nSo one solution to the fatalistic threat posed by middle knowledge is\nakin to the Aristotelian solution. Since there are no facts of the\nrelevant sort, God cannot have knowledge of them. But, because there\nare no such facts, God\u2019s lack of knowledge of how free creatures\nwould freely act is no bar to his omniscience.\n\nAre there any other solutions?\n\nIt is difficult to see how there could be. In the case of actual\nactions, the solutions depended on suggesting ways in which it might\nhave been possible for Jones to do something which would bring it\nabout that some fact about God was different; that is to say that they\ndepended on showing how some fact about God might be dependent on what\nJones did. Now in the case of middle knowledge we know how such a\ndependence would have to operate; it would have to operate by way of\nGod\u2019s knowledge of counterfactuals of freedom. So, could the\ntruth of counterfactuals of freedom related to Jones be dependent on\nJones\u2019s actions? It seems that they could not be, because the\nfacts that make them true were available to God at the creation,\nbefore he had decided to create anything, let alone Jones. So the\nfacts, like God\u2019s decision, must have been ontologically prior,\nit seems, to any act of Jones\u2019s. So it seems that it could not\nbe in Jones\u2019s power so to act that any actually true\ncounterfactual of freedom relating to him would not have been true\n(Hasker 1989, 39\u201352; see Hasker et al. 2000 for a collection of\nwritings on middle knowledge).\n7. The Idle Argument\n\nAristotle mentions, as a corollary of the conclusion that everything\nthat happens, happens of necessity, that \u201cthere would be no need\nto deliberate or to take trouble (thinking that if we do this, this\nwill happen, but if we do not, it will not).\u201d (Aristotle, De\nInterpretatione, 18b31\u20133)\n\nThis thought was spelt out in what was known as \u201cthe Idle\nArgument\u201d (Bobzien 1998, Section 5). It went like this:\n\n\nIf it is fated that you will recover from this illness, then,\nregardless of whether you consult a doctor or you do not consult a\ndoctor you will recover.\n\nBut also, if it is fated that you will not recover from this illness,\nthen, regardless of whether you consult a doctor or you do not consult\na doctor you will not recover.\n\nBut either it is fated that you will recover from this illness or it\nis fated that you will not recover.\n\nTherefore it is futile to consult a doctor.\n\n\nThe thought, presumably, is that it is futile, because what you do\nwill have no effect. If so, the reply given by Chrysippus\n(c280\u2013c206 B.C.E.) to this argument seems exactly right (Bobzien\n1998, 5.2). The conclusion does not follow, because it may have been\nfated that you will recover as a result of seeing the doctor. The\ncorresponding reply would be equally apt if we substituted\n\u201cnecessary\u201d for \u201cfated\u201d.\n\nSome versions of the argument omit \u201cit is fated that\u201d\n(Bobzien 1998, 189). It goes without saying that the corresponding\nversion of Chrysippus\u2019s reply would deal with those versions of\nthe argument.\n\nThis is not to say that fatalism does not pose any problem at all for\nthe rationality of deliberation. It is just to say that the Idle\nArgument does not show that it poses a problem.\n\nThe idle argument as originally presented was designed to show, not\nthat fatalism was correct or incorrect, but that it would have a\ncertain consequence. However, a generalised form of the version that\nomitted \u201cit is fated that\u201d would, if sound, seem to\nthreaten to establish something akin to fatalism: not, indeed, that we\nare powerless to do anything other than what we actually do, but that\nacting is futile. Although it seems that Chrysippus\u2019s reply\nwould show that such an argument would not in fact be sound, it is not\nat all clear where exactly it would go wrong. A detailed discussion of\nthis question can be found in Bledin 2020.\n8. Conclusion\n\nThere are a number of arguments for fatalism, and it seems that one\nway of countering all of them would be to adopt the Aristotelian\nsolution, or something akin to it. It would be neat if it could be\nmade out that this was the only solution, so that the fate of fatalism\nwas inextricably linked to the fate of the Aristotelian solution. But\nit does not seem that this is so, except possibly, on the assumption\nthat an omniscient God exists, in relation to middle knowledge. But\neven then, the solution is only a poor relation to the Aristotelian\nsolution.\n\nSo it is possible that both fatalism and the Aristotelian solution are\nwrong. And it is, of course, always possible, for all that has been\nsaid, that fatalism is correct.\n", "bibliography": {"categories": [], "cat_ref_text": {"ref_list": ["Adams, Marilyn McCord, 1987, <em>William Ockham</em>, Notre Dame,\nInd.: University of Notre Dame Press.", "Adams, Robert, 1977, \u201cMiddle Knowledge and the Problem of\nEvil\u201d, <em>American Philosophical Quarterly</em>, 14:\n109\u2013117; reprinted in Hasker <em>et al</em>. 2000.", "Alston, William, 1986, \u201cDoes God Have Beliefs?\u201d,\n<em>Religious Studies</em>, 22: 287\u2013306.", "Anglin, W.
