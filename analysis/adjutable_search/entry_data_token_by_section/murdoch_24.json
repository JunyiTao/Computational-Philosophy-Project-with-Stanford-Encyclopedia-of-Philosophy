    "main_text": "Metaphysics as a Guide to Morals || Duty\n15.2 Axioms\n\nThe notion of duty is connected with a third \u201cmode of moral\nbeing\u201d, part of the field of force constituted by all these\nmodes, that she calls \u201caxioms\u201d. Axioms are roughly the\npolitical counterpart of duties, the latter understood as operating in\nthe terrain of personal behavior (Antonaccio 2000: 159). Axioms are\n(relatively) fixed and unavoidable constraints and requirements\ngoverning behavior in the political domain. Like duties, they do not\nform a system, but are distinct in their individual character, as\nillustrated by Murdoch\u2019s most frequent example of an axiom-type,\nthat of rights. She mentions, for example, the right to happiness, the\nright to vote, rights animals have (presumably not to be made to\nsuffer), and the rights of women. Even if all are rights, they have\ndifferent valuational characters. Axioms operate by being regarded as\nreadily understood unconditional and inviolable standards, and so can\nbe invoked and expect to be honored (Browning 2019: 185).\n\nIn contrast to (though not strictly incompatible with) what she says\nabout duties, axioms are historical products, and this is connected\nwith their being unsystematic and piecemeal. Women\u2019s coming to\nbe seen as having equal rights with men might not have happened, but\nit did, and now (Murdoch thinks) equal rights for women has the status\nof an axiom. Axioms are products of genuine, if historically\ncontingent, moral insight.\n\nIn MGM, Murdoch sees the individual-moral and the political\ndomains as governed by very different norms and principles, each\nneeding to be protected from too much influence from the other. \n\n\nLiberal political thought posits a certain fundamental distinction\nbetween the person as citizen and the person as moral-spiritual\nindividual. (MGM 1992: 357) \n\n\nShe sees the individual-moral domain (notably excluding duty) as\ngoverned by a \u2018perfectionism\u2019 that is continuous from\nSovereignty to Metaphysics. The aspiration to the\nhighest moral goodness is the proper aim of the human person. By\ncontrast, the polity cannot be \u2018perfected\u2019; its proper aim\nis to be \u2018decent\u2019 (MGM 1992: 356), to try to limit the\nevil contained therein (MGM 1992: 368, from Simone Weil). This view is\na radical departure from Murdoch\u2019s political thinking in her\nfascinating 1958 essay, \u201cA House of Theory\u201d, her only\npre-Metaphysics political philosophy writing. There, and in\noccasional remarks in Sovereignty, Murdoch sees moral ideas\nand ideals as the appropriate normative source for sociopolitical\narrangements\u2014for example, as in \u201cHouse\u201d, the ideas\nof dignity in work, and the communal bonds of work. In\nMetaphysics this view is largely (not entirely) rejected\n(Blum forthcoming).\n\nThough, in contrast to duties and moral vision, axioms concern the\npolitical rather than the individual-moral realm, Murdoch conceives of\nthem as part of the fabric of moral being. They bear on individual\nconduct through the individual\u2019s status as a citizen, wherein we\nrecognize, support, and honor human rights, though it is the state that\nadopts policies that officially recognize rights (and other axioms). Civic\nmorality is part of the individual\u2019s moral being. The inclusion\nof the political as a distinct aspect of moral thinking and being does\nnot take Murdoch in the direction of envisioning the human person as\ndeeply embedded in a rich web of social/institutional relationships\nthat shape her moral being and her moral requirements\u2014for\nexample, in social role relationships, as explored in her friend\nDorothy Emmet\u2019s 1966 Rules, Roles, and Relations (Emmet\n1996). Alasdair MacIntyre (Emmet\u2019s student and collaborator)\nmakes this point in a review of Metaphysics: \n\n\n[W]hat is absent is any conception of the achievement of the Good as a\ntask for human beings in community, so that the transformation of the\nself has to be a transformation of social relationships. (MacIntyre\n1993: 2)\n\n\nThe pluralistic conception of morality in the field of force idea goes\nbeyond the rejection of a single principle governing conduct, such as\nutilitarianism, Kantianism, or certain versions of virtue theory.\nThese monistic views concern only conduct, and their rejection\n(discussed earlier in relation to McDowell\u2019s Murdochian\nAristotelianism) leaves in place, in Sovereignty, a unity\ninvolved in the idea of moral vision/purification of consciousness.\nThe pluralism in Metaphysics\u2019s modes of ethical being\nidea rejects a unity of that sort as well, seeing the purification of\nconsciousness as only one, though the most significant, aspect of\nmorality in the overall \u201cfield of force\u201d of our ethical\nbeing (Hopwood 2019).\n",
