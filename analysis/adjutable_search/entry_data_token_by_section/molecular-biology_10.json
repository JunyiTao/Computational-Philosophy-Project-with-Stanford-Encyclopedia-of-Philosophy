    "main_text": "Molecular Biology and General Philosophy of Science || Reduction\n3.1 Reduction\n\nReduction may be understood in multiple ways depending on what it is\nthat is being reduced (see the entry on\n scientific reduction).\n Theory reduction pertains to whether or not theories from one\nscientific field can be reduced to theories from another scientific\nfield. In contrast, explanatory reduction (often united with\nmethodological reduction) pertains to whether or not explanations that\ncome from lower levels (often united with methodologies that\ninvestigate those lower levels) are better than explanations that come\nfrom higher levels. Philosophical attention to molecular biology has\ncontributed to debates about both of these senses of reduction (see\nthe entry on\n reductionism in biology).\n\nPhilosophy of biology first came to prominence as a sub-specialty of\nphilosophy of science in the 1970s when it offered an apparent case\nstudy by which to judge how theories from one field may reduce to\ntheories from another field. The specific question was: might classic,\nMendelian genetics reduce to molecular genetics (see the entry on\n \nmolecular genetics)?\n Kenneth Schaffner used and developed Ernst Nagel\u2019s (1961)\nanalysis of derivational theory reduction to argue for the reduction\nof classical Mendelian genetics (T2) to molecular\nbiology (T1) and refined it over many years\n(summarized in Schaffner 1993). The goal of formal reduction was to\nlogically deduce the laws of classical genetics (or its improved\nsuccessor, \u201cmodern transmission genetics\u201d\nT2*) from the laws of molecular biology. Such a\nderivation required that all the terms of T2* not\nin T1 had to be connected to terms in\nT1 via correspondence rules. Hence, Schaffner\nendeavored to find molecular equivalents of such terms as\n\u201cgene\u201d, as well as predicate terms, such as \u201cis\ndominant\u201d. David Hull (1974) criticized formal reduction, argued\nagainst Schaffner\u2019s claims, and suggested, instead, that perhaps\nmolecular biology replaced classical genetics.\n\nEven though Schaffner and Hull were engaged in a debate over theory\nreduction, they simultaneously admitted that the question of formal\ntheory reduction was rather peripheral to what scientists actually did\nand studied (Schaffner 1974b; Hull 1974). And indeed, while the theory\nreduction debate was playing out, a number of philosophers of biology\nswitched attention from scientific theories to the\nstuff in nature that scientists investigated. William Wimsatt\n(1976) argued for a shift in the reduction debate from talk of\nrelations between theories to talk of decompositional explanation via\nmechanisms. And Lindley Darden and Nancy Maull (1977) focused\nattention on the bridges between fields formed by part-whole\nrelations, structure-function relations, and cause-effect\nrelations.\n\nThis shift in attention was a precursor to understanding the\nphilosophy of science through the lens of mechanisms. Darden, building\non the work of Machamer, Darden, and Craver (2000), has more recently\nreturned to the question of how Mendelian and molecular genetics are\nrelated and viewed it through this lens (Darden 2005). Rather than\nunderstanding the relationship as one of reduction, she suggests they\ncan be understood as relating via a focus on different working\nentities (often at different size levels) that operate at different\ntimes. Thus, the relation was one of integration of sequentially\noperating chromosomal and molecular hereditary mechanisms rather than\nreduction. (For an alternative but still integrative reading of the\nrelationship between classical genetics and molecular biology that\nfocuses on their shared functional units, see Baetu 2010.)\n\nReduction can also be about explanation and methodology. That is,\nreduction can be about using reductive methodologies to dig down to\nlower levels because the thought is that this exercise leads to more\nreductive explanations and more reductive explanations are better than\nexplanations at higher levels. Alex Rosenberg (1997, 2006)\ncontroversially divided biology into molecular biology and everything\nelse, which he dubbed \u201cfunctional biology\u201d.\n\u201cReductionism\u201d, Rosenberg argued,\n\n\nis the thesis that biological theories and explanations that employ\nthem do need to be grounded in molecular biology and ultimately\nphysical science, for it is only by doing so that they can be\nimproved, corrected, strengthened, and made more accurate and more\nadequate and completed. (Rosenberg 2006: 4)\n\n\nHence, the task of this explanatory reduction is to explain all\nfunctional biological phenomena via molecular biology.\n\nCritics and defenders of Rosenberg\u2019s view have discussed\norganizational and contextual features not captured by molecular\nbiological principles. These included orientation of the embryo in the\nearth\u2019s gravitational field and other spatial, regulatory, and\ndynamical properties of developing systems (e.g., see Delehanty 2005;\nFrost-Arnold 2004; Keller 1999; Laubichler and Wagner 2001; Love et\nal. 2008; Robert 2001, 2004). This particular debate can be understood\nas an instance of a more general debate occurring in biology and\nphilosophy of biology about whether investigations of lower-level\nmolecular biology are better than investigations of high-level systems\nbiology (Baetu 2012a; Bechtel and Abrahamsen 2010; De Backer, De\nWaele, and Van Speybroeck 2010; Huettemann and Love 2011; Marco 2012;\nMorange 2008; Pigliucci 2013; Powell and Dupre 2009; see also the\nentries on\n feminist philosophy of biology,\n philosophy of systems and synthetic biology, and\n multiple realizability).\n",
