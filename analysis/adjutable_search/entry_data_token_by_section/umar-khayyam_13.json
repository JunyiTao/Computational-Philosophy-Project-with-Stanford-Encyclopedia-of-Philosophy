Once again the tension between Khayyam\u2019s poetic and philosophical modes of thought surfaces; experientially there is evidence to conclude that death is the end:\n\nBehind the curtain none has found his way\nNone came to know the secret as we could say\nAnd each repeats the dirge his fancy taught\nWhich has no sense-but never ends the lay\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 (Whinfield 2001, 229)\n\nIn the Rub\u0101\u2018iyy\u0101t, Khayyam portrays the universe as a beautiful ode which reads \u201cfrom dust we come and to dust we return,\u201d and \u201cevery brick is made from the skull of a man.\u201d While Khayyam does not explicitly deny the existence of life after death, perhaps for political reasons and fear of being labeled a heretic, there are subtle references throughout his Rub\u0101\u2018iyy\u0101t that the hereafter should be taken with a grain of salt. In contrast, in his philosophical writings we see him argue for the incorporeality of the soul, which paves the path for the existence of life after death. The irreconcilable conflict between Khayyam\u2019s observation that death is the inevitable end for all beings, and his philosophical reflections in favor of the possibility of the existence of life after death, remains an insoluble riddle.[10]\n",
