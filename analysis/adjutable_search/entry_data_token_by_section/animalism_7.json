Arguments for and Objections to Animalism\n\nParticularly when introduced in isolation, animalism\u2014especially\n(1)\u2014might strike one as obviously true. In his book-length\ntreatment of the view, Snowdon demonstrates at length how animalism\n\u201crepresents the default conception of ourselves\u201d (2014:\n106). And in an earlier article, he notes:\n\n\nThe central claim of animalism is in some ways a curious proposition\nto assert. It is natural to respond to its assertion in the words of\nWittgenstein: \u201cOnly whom are we informing of this? And on what\noccasion?\u201d. (1995: 72; Wittgenstein 1953: 101e)\n\n\nOlson echoes this sentiment, writing that we certainly\n\n\nseem to be animals. When you eat or sleep or talk, a human\nanimal eats, sleeps, or talks. When you look in the mirror, and animal\nlooks back at you. Most ordinary people suppose that we are animals.\n\u2026 Compared with [competing] proposals, the idea that we are\nanimals looks like plain common sense. (2007: 23)\n\n\nBut common sense will not settle the issue because some of\nanimalism\u2019s rivals are supported by other, equally intuitive\nconsiderations. In addition to common sense, then, what arguments can\nbe marshaled in support of animalism?\n",
