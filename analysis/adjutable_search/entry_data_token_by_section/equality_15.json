    "main_text": "Relational Equality\n4. Relational Equality\n\nSince the late 1990s, social relations egalitarianism has appeared in\nphilosophical discourse as an increasingly important competitor to\ndistribuitivist accounts of justice, especially its luck egalitarian\nversions (cf. Lippert-Rassmussen 2018). Proponents of social relations\negalitarianism include Anderson (1999), Miller (1997), Scanlon (1996,\n2018), Scheffler (2003, 2005, 2015), Wolff (1998, 2010) and Young\n(1990). Negatively, they are united in a rejection of the view that\njustice is a matter of eliminating differential luck. Positively, they\nclaim that society is just if, and only if, individuals within it\nrelate to one another as equals. Accordingly, the site of justice\n(i.e. that to which principles of justice apply) is society, not\ndistributions. Relational Egalitarianism has a certain overlap with\nmany theories of recognition and non-domination. Certain status\ndifferences are at the core of their objections, like those\nstigmatizing differences in status, whereby the badly off are caused\nto experience themselves as inferior, and are treated as inferiors, or\nwhen inequalities create objectionable relations of\npower(Honneth/Fraser 2003) and domination (Pettit 2001).\n\nWhat does it mean that (and when do) individuals within a society\nrelate to one another as equals? Racial discrimination, for example,\nis a paradigmatic instance of this condition?s violation. But once we\nmove beyond a handful of such examples things become much less\nclear.\n\nThese claims to social and political equality exclude all unequal,\nhierarchical forms of social relationships, in which some people\ndominate, exploit, marginalize, demean, and inflict violence upon\nothers:\n\nAs a social ideal, it holds that a human society must be conceived of\nas a cooperative arrangement among equals, each of whom enjoys the\nsame social standing. As a political ideal, it highlights the claims\nthat citizens are entitled to make on one another by virtue of their\nstatus as citizens, without any need for a moralized accounting of the\ndetails of their particular circumstances. (Scheffler 2003, p. 22)\n\n\nHowever, forms of differentiation that do not violate moral equality\n(see above) are not per se excluded from social equality, if they are\ncompatible with the recognition of the equal social status of\nconcerned parties, as with differences relating to merit, need, and,\nif appropriate, race, gender, and social background (as in cases of\naffirmative action or fair punishment).\n\nWhere there is social equality, people feel that each member of the\ncommunity enjoys an equal standing with all the rest that overrides\ntheir unequal ratings along particular dimensions. (Miller, 1997, p.\n232)\n\n\nThus the question has to be answered whether \u2013 and if so, why\n\u2013 other dimensions, such as a person\u2019s natural talents,\ncreativity, intelligence, innovative skills or entrepreneurial\nability, can be the basis for legitimate inequalities.\n\nRelational egalitarians need a certain conception of what an equal\nstanding in society amounts to and implies in terms of rights and\ngoods. One way to offer such an account would be to rely (like\nAnderson 1999) on the capabilities approach (\u00a73.8) and\nsufficitarianism (\u00a76.2.): In a democratic community that\npreserves the free and equal status of persons, at least three sets of\nconditions have to be fulfilled.\n\nFirst, certain political conditions are necessary to allow citizens to\nparticipate as equals in democratic deliberation. These include, among\nothers, the capabilities to vote, hold office, assemble, petition the\ngovernment, speak freely, and move about freely (Rawls 1999, p.53).\nThe principle of democratic equality (as asked for by Anderson 1999)\nrequires us to eliminate social hierarchies that prevent a\ndemocratically organized society, a society in which we cooperate and\ndecide upon state action as equals. Persons morally owe each other the\ncapabilities and conditions to live as equals in a democratic\ncommunity (Christiano 2008, Kolodny 2014). Democracy can be\ninterpreted as realizing public equality in collective\ndecision-making.\n\nSecond, to participate as an equal in civil society, certain civil\nconditions must obtain. These include the conditions that make it\nrobustly likely that injustices such as marginalization,\npowerlessness, cultural imperialism (Anderson 1999 with reference to\nYoung 1990), or domination (Pettit 2001) can be to avoided. Third,\ncertain social conditions and personal capabilities have to obtain\nthat enable people to enjoy equal standing in society. Citizens need,\nin this regard, adequate nutrition, shelter, clothing, education, and\nmedical care. This last point leads into the debate over whether a\nrelational egalitarian conception of social justice yields intrinsic\nand instrumental reasons of justice to care about distributive\ninequality in socially produced goods, despite its emphasis on just\nsocial relationships and not the distribution of goods per se\n(Schemmel 2011, Elford 2017).\n",
