Immaterialism and the Compositional Structure of the World\n\nIn his Triumph of Philosophy, Taurellus accepts the\ntraditional claim that the elements (earth, water, air, fire) are the\nbasic constituents of the natural world. However, he develops an\nintricate argument for denying the received view that prime matter\nenters into the constitution of elements (see Blank 2014). Thereby, he\noffers a reinterpretation of the nature of the elements. The argument\nstarts with a consideration of the motivation for introducing the\nnotions of form and prime matter. As he describes it, the motivation\narises out of the view that in natural things there are contrary\nproperties: active properties such as the capacity of bringing forth\nchanges in other things, and passive properties such as the capacity\nof undergoing change through the agency of other things. If these\nproperties are understood as contrary, then they seem to require two\ndifferent origins. For this reason, the active properties of natural\nthings were seen as requiring the existence of forms, while the\npassive properties of natural things were seen as requiring the\nexistence of primary matter (PT: 202).\n\nHowever, Taurellus challenges the assumption that active and passive\nproperties of natural things should be regarded as contraries. This is\nwhy: \u201cNothing takes on its contrary but rather cedes when the\ncontrary comes; but passivity increases with the increase of\nactivity\u201d (PT: 284). Hence, his argument against the contrary\nnature of active and passive properties is that an increase of passive\npower is compatible with an increase of active power. But if activity\nand passivity are not contraries, \u201cthey are present in the same\nsubject and proceed from the same cause\u201d (PT: 292). At the same\ntime, Taurellus holds on to the assumption that the active properties\nof things have to be explained by the existence of an active\nprinciple. This is why he does not eliminate the notion of form from\nhis ontology. On the contrary, because active and passive properties\nare not contraries, he believes that they proceed from forms alone:\n\n\n\nWe say that a thing is active and passive with respect to the same\nform; but in such a way that action is its proper effect, while the\nother does not arise from matter conjoined with it but from an\nexternally existing contrary principle. (PT: 294)\n\n\nRegarding forms as the unique kind of origin of the active and passive\nproperties of natural things also leads to a reinterpretation of the\ncompositional structure of the world. In Taurellus\u2019s view, forms\nare the only beings underlying the compositional structure of the\nworld: \u201cMatter plainly does not exist, and nothing but forms can\nbe and can enter composition\u201d (PT, 280). Accordingly,\n\u201cmixture or composition is \u2026 a mere conjunction of forms\nthat in no way changes them\u201d (PT: 276). At the same time,\nunderstanding composition in this way implies that no substantial form\ncan be understood as a composition of other forms (PT: 274). Rather,\nevery composition is accidental (PT). This is why Taurellus formulates\nthe provocative claim that a human being does not possess substantial\nunity but rather is an aggregate of a plurality of forms (PT:\n110).\n\nTaurellus continues to use the term \u201cmatter\u201d. Obviously,\nhowever, his immaterialism about the basic constituents of the natural\nworld leads to a reinterpretation of the meaning of the term. One of\nthe reinterpretations that he offers derives from his view that\ncomplex natural beings contain a plurality of hierarchically ordered\nsubstantial forms. His reinterpretation of matter in terms of\nsubordinate forms allows Taurellus to continue to talk about bodies\n(corpora) and corporeal beings (entia corporalia)\n(PT: 160\u2013162; 182; 352\u2013354; 552\u2013554). As he puts it,\n\u201cif it is not understood as a less noble form, \u2026 matter\ndoes absolutely not compose anything\u201d (PT: 278). Thus, there is\na sense in which one can talk about matter in which one uses a\ntraditional connotation of the notion of matter, namely, that it is\nsomething less noble that underlies something nobler (PT: 296). Thus,\neven if the idea that prime matter underlies form is given up, the\nstructure of something less noble underlying something nobler can be\nupheld. More specifically, less noble forms can be understood as the\nsubjects of nobler forms. In Taurellus\u2019s view, things receive\nthe character of subjects \n\n\nfor the same reason that makes that they are less noble, such that\nforms that are within nothing else but serve as subjects for something\nelse are the most ignoble, but those that do not serve as subjects for\nanything else but are within something else are nobler. (PT: 330)\n\n\nAs Taurellus explains, a form is nobler than other forms if it is more\nprone to cause changes in other forms, and form is less noble than\nother forms if it is more prone to receive the effect of the\nactivities of other forms. Passive changes of forms thus are seen as a\nresult of the contingent activity of other forms together with the\ninternal constitution of the forms that have undergone change (PT:\n298). In this sense, in Taurellus\u2019s view the subordination\nrelation between substantial forms reduces to relations of efficient\ncausation between substantial forms. Consequently, Taurellus regards\nthe activities of substantial forms as the origin of all of the forces\nfound in the natural world: \n\n\nNature is the unique principle of corporeal things and consists in a\nsingle substance, not in two or three substances. This substance seems\nto be manifold because it expresses itself in various forces. (PT:\n376)\n\n\nThere is still another sense in which the notion of matter retains a\nfunction in Taurellus\u2019s metaphysics. This becomes clear when\nTaurellus suggests a metaphorical usage of the notion of prime matter.\nAs he puts it, with respect to God prime matter is \u201cthe\nNOTHING\u201d (in capital letters) out of which God creates the world\n(PT). The connection that Taurellus establishes between the notion of\nprime matter and the notion of nothing strongly differs from the use\nof the term \u201cnothing\u201d that often designates matter in the\nNeoplatonic tradition (see Bovillus 1510: fol. 63v\u201364r).\nTaurellus denies that prime matter is a constituent of created beings\nand holds that immaterial forms have active and passive\ncharacteristics of their own. His point is not that matter, due to its\nlack of determination, is \u201cclose to\u201d nothing, nor that\nmatter is undetermined except for its three-dimensional\ncharacteristics. Rather, when he calls prime matter\n\u201cnothing\u201d he has in mind a strict identity statement. This\nis why it is a suitable metaphor for what is there before the divine\nact of creation, namely, no created being. Prime matter in this\nmetaphorical sense is absolute non-being.\n",
