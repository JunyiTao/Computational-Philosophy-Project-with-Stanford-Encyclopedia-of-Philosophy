If, on the one hand, one accepts a hard deterministic\naccount of responsibility, everything is a matter of responsibility\nluck. A hard deterministic account of responsibility says that\nresponsibility and determinism are incompatible, that determinism is\ntrue, and, hence, that no one is ever responsible for anything. Most\nbelieve that, if hard determinism is true, extensionally speaking,\nluck-egalitarianism collapses into straight equality of outcome (e.g.,\nSmilansky 1997, 156; but see Stemplowska 2008). If, on the other hand,\none accepts a compatibilist, reason responsiveness account of\nresponsibility, many outcomes will not be a matter of responsibility\nluck, at least for some agents. A compatibilist, reason responsiveness\naccount of responsibility for outcomes says that an agent is\nresponsible for outcomes that he or she brings about in the right sort\nof way through the agent\u2019s actions (or omissions) where these\nissue from an action-generating process that is sufficiently sensitive\nto practical reasons, e.g., normal human deliberation, and that\nactions may issue from such mechanisms whether or not determinism\nobtains (Fischer and Ravizza 1998). Still, agents who act from reason\nresponsive mechanisms may face choice situations that differ much in\nterms of how favorable they are in which case inequalities reflecting\nsuch differences may not be just, even if they obtain between agents\nwho are responsible for the choices they made. For this reason (among\nothers), it is open for compatibilist luck-egalitarians to think that\nlittle inequality can be justified by differential exercises of choice\n(see Barry 2005).\n\nOne issue which has received quite a lot of attention in the debate\nabout justice and luck is the regression principle governing luck:\n\nIf the causes of Y are a matter of luck for X,\nso is Y.\n\n\nIf this principle is coupled with control or choice accounts of luck,\neverything turns into luck. For if we couple (9) with, say, the thick,\nchoice-based account of responsibility luck, it follows that for my\npresent reckless driving not to be a matter of (bad) luck, it will\nhave to be the case that I am responsible for, and hence have chosen,\nthe causes of my present reckless driving. In turn, for me to be\nresponsible for these causes I will in turn have to be responsible\nfor, and hence have chosen, the causes of these causes of my reckless\ndriving; and so on. Obviously, at some point, moving back through the\ncausal chain (e.g., prior to my coming into existence, if not long\nbefore that), choice, and thus responsibility, will peter out. So it\nwill follow that I am not responsible for my present reckless driving:\nit is my bad luck that I drive my car in a totally irresponsible way.\nGeneralizing this sort of reasoning, no one would ever be responsible\nfor anything\u2014that everything would be a matter of responsibility\nluck. As Thomas Nagel writes \u201cEverything seems to result from\nthe combined influence of factors, antecedent and posterior to action,\nthat are not within the agent\u2019s control. Since he cannot be\nresponsible for them, he cannot be responsible for their\nresults\u201d (Nagel 1979, 35; compare Strawson 1994; Watson 2006,\n428).\n\nThe view that everything is a matter of responsibility (and desert)\nluck obviously flies in the face of our everyday ascriptions of\nresponsibility. Accordingly, this implication of the regression\nprinciple is often deployed in a corresponding reductio ad absurdum\n(Hurley 1993, 183; Hurley 2003; Nozick 1974, 225; Sher 1997,\n67\u201369; Zaitchik 1977, 371\u2013373). However, this reductio is\nperhaps too hasty. It has been argued that the principle (applied to\ncontrol) is not simply a matter of \u201cgeneralization from certain\nclear cases.\u201d Rather, it is a condition that we \u201care\nactually being persuaded\u201d is correct when we apply it to cases\n\u201cbeyond the original set\u201d, where, on reflection, we find\nthat \u201ccontrol is absent\u201d (Nagel 1979, 26\u201327). If\nthis is right, it seems we need an alternative explanation of why\nmoral responsibility is absent in those cases where control of causes\nis absent. So, for instance, if we agree that a person who offends, as\nan adult, as a result of childhood deprivation is not responsible for\nhis action, we need to explain what, here, nullifies responsibility if\nnot lack of control over causes of the agent\u2019s actions. That is,\nwe need to explain why certain kinds of causal background to action\nthreaten control while others do not even if we are dealing with cases\nwith the shared feature that the agent does not control the early\nparts of those causal backgrounds.\n\nAddressing this problem, Fischer and Ravizza suggest that a\n\u201cprocess of taking responsibility is necessary for moral\nresponsibility\u201d (Fischer and Ravizza 1998, 200). They add that,\nsince processes are necessarily historical, it follows that their\naccount of responsibility attends to an action\u2019s genesis or\norigins. With the same problem in mind, Susan Hurley suggests that\nresponsibility requires that the process \u201cby which\nreason-responsive mechanisms and self-perceptions in relation to these\nmechanisms are acquired\u201d (Hurley 2003, 51) is one in which the\nagent is equipped with mechanisms that are sufficiently responsive to\nobjective reasons (Hurley 2003, 51\u20132). That is, the reasons for\nwhich the agent acts must match the reasons for action that there in\nfact are sufficiently well, although this match need not be perfect.\nWhether either of these suggestions accommodates cases where,\ninitially, responsibility seems to be undermined by lack of control of\ncauses, remains to be seen. \n\nFor a brief discussion of the notion of constitutive luck see the\nfollowing supplementary document:\n Constitutive Luck.\n",
