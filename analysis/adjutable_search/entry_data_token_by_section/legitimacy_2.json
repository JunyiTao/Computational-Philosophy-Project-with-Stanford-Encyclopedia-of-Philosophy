    "main_text": "The Function of Political Legitimacy || Legitimacy and the Justification of Political Authority\n2.1 Legitimacy and the Justification of Political Authority\n\nThe normative concept of political legitimacy is often seen as related\nto the justification of authority. The main function of political\nlegitimacy, on this interpretation, is to explain the difference\nbetween merely effective or de facto authority and legitimate\nauthority.\n\nJohn Locke put forward such an interpretation of legitimacy.\nLocke\u2019s starting-point is a state of nature in which all\nindividuals are equally free to act within the constraints of natural\nlaw and no individual is subject to the will of another. As Rawls\n(2007: 129) characterizes Locke\u2019s understanding of the state of\nnature, it is \u201ca state of equal right, all being kings.\u201d\nNatural law, while manifest in the state of nature, is not\nsufficiently specific to rule a society and cannot enforce itself when\nviolated, however. The solution to this problem is a social contract\nthat transfers political authority to a civil state that can realize\nand secure the natural law. According to Locke, and contrary to his\npredecessor Thomas Hobbes, the social contract thus does not create\nauthority. Political authority is embodied in individuals and\npre-exists in the state of nature. The social contract transfers the\nauthority they each enjoy in the state of nature to a particular\npolitical body.\n\nWhile political authority thus pre-exists in the state of nature,\nlegitimacy is a concept that is specific to the civil state. Because\nthe criterion of legitimacy that Locke proposes is historical,\nhowever, what counts as legitimate authority remains connected to the\nstate of nature. The legitimacy of political authority in the civil\nstate depends, according to Locke, on whether the transfer of\nauthority has happened in the right way. Whether the transfer has\nhappened in the right way depends on individuals\u2019 consent:\n\u201cno one can be put out of this estate and subjected to the\npolitical power of another without his own consent\u201d (Locke 1980\n[1690]: 52). Anyone who has given their express or tacit consent to\nthe social contract is bound to obey a state\u2019s laws (Locke 1980\n[1690]: 63). Locke understands the consent criterion to apply not just\nto the original institutionalization of a political\nauthority\u2014what Rawls (2007: 124) calls \u201coriginating\nconsent\u201d. It also applies to the ongoing evaluation of the\nperformance of a political regime\u2014Rawls (2007: 124) calls this\n\u201cjoining consent\u201d.\n\nAlthough Locke emphasises consent, consent is not, however, sufficient\nfor legitimate authority because an authority that suspends the\nnatural law is necessarily illegitimate (e.g., Simmons 1976). On some\ninterpretations of Locke (e.g., Pitkin 1965), consent is not even\nnecessary for legitimate political authority; the absence of consent\nis only a marker of illegitimacy. Whether an actual political regime\nrespects the constraints of the natural law is thus at least one\nfactor that determines its legitimacy.\n\nThis criterion of legitimacy is negative: it offers an account of when\neffective authority ceases to be legitimate. When a political\nauthority fails to secure consent or oversteps the boundaries of the\nnatural law, it ceases to be legitimate and, therefore, there is no\nlonger an obligation to obey its commands. For Locke\u2014unlike for\nHobbes\u2014political authority can thus not be absolute.\n\nThe contemporary literature has developed Locke\u2019s ideas in\nseveral ways. John Simmons (2001) uses them to argue that we should\ndistinguish between the moral justification of states in general and\nthe political legitimacy of actual states. We will come back to this\npoint in section 3.2. Joseph Raz links legitimacy to the justification\nof political authority. According to Raz, political authority is just\na special case of the more general concept of authority (1986, 1995,\n2006). He defines authority in relation to a claim\u2014of a person\nor an agency\u2014to generate what he calls pre-emptive reasons. Such\nreasons replace other reasons for action that people might have. For\nexample, if a teacher asks her students to do some homework, she\nexpects her say-so to give the students reason to do the homework.\n\nAuthority is effective if it gets people to act on the reasons it\ngenerates. The difference between effective and legitimate authority,\non Raz\u2019 view, is that the former merely purports to change the\nreasons that apply to others, while legitimate authority actually has\nthe capacity to change these reasons. Legitimate authority satisfies a\npre-emption thesis: \u201cThe fact that an authority requires\nperformance of an action is a reason for its performance which is not\nto be added to all other relevant reasons when assessing what to do,\nbut should exclude and take the place of some of them\u201d (Raz\n1986: 46). (There are limits to what even a legitimate authority can\nrightfully order others to do, which is why it does not necessarily\nreplace all relevant reasons.)\n\nWhen is effective or de facto authority legitimate? In other\nwords, what determines whether the pre-emption thesis is satisfied?\nRaz\u2019 answer is captured in two further theses. The\n\u201cdependence thesis\u201d states that the justification of\npolitical authority depends on the normative reasons that apply to\nthose under its rule directly, independently of the authority\u2019s\ndirectives. Building on the dependence thesis, the \u201cnormal\njustification thesis\u201d then states that political authority is\njustified if it enables those subject to it to better comply with the\nreasons that apply to them anyway. In full, the normal justification\nthesis says: \u201cThe normal way to establish that a person has\nauthority over another involves showing that the alleged subject is\nlikely to better comply with the reasons which apply to him (other\nthan the alleged authoritative directive) if he accepts the directives\nof the alleged authority as authoritatively binding and tries to\nfollow them, rather than by trying to follow the reasons which apply\nto him directly\u201d (Raz 1986: 53). The normal justification thesis\nexplains why those governed by a legitimate authority ought to treat\nits directives as binding. It thus follows as a corollary of the\nnormal justification thesis that such an authority generates a duty to\nbe obeyed. Raz calls his conception the \u201cservice\nconception\u201d of authority (1986: 56). Note that even though\nlegitimate authority is defined as a special case of effective\nauthority, only the former is appropriately described as a serving its\nsubjects. Illegitimate\u2014but effective\u2014authority does not\nserve those it aims to govern, although it may purport to do so.\n\nWilliam Edmundson formulates this way of linking authority and\nlegitimacy via a condition he calls the warranty thesis: \u201cIf\nbeing an X entails claiming to F, then being a\nlegitimate X entails truly claiming to\nF.\u201d (Edmundson 1998: 39). Being an X here\nstands for \u201ca state\u201d, or \u201can authority\u201d. And\n\u201cto F\u201d stands for \u201cto create a duty to be\nobeyed\u201d, for example. The idea expressed by the warranty thesis\nis that legitimacy morally justifies an independently existing\nauthority such that the claims of the authority become moral\nobligations.\n",
