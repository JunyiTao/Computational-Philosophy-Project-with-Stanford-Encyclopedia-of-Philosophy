    "main_text": "Introduction || Non-Extensionality\n1.2 Non-Extensionality\n\nAn important philosophical issue concerning the \\(\\lambda\\)-calculus\nis the question of its underlying concept of functions. In set theory,\na function is standardly understood as a set of argument-value pairs.\nMore specifically, a function is understood as a set \\(f\\) of ordered\npairs satisfying the property that \\((x,y) \\in f\\) and \\((x,z) \\in f\\)\nimplies \\(y = z\\). If \\(f\\) is a function and \\((x,y) \\in f\\), this\nmeans that the function f assigns the value \\(y\\) to the argument\n\\(x\\). This is the concept of\nfunctions-as-sets. Consequently, the notion\nof equality of functions-as-sets is equality qua sets, which,\nunder the standard principle of extensionality, entails that two\nfunctions are equal precisely when they contain the same ordered\npairs. In other words, two functions are identical if and only if they\nassign the same values to the same arguments. In this sense,\nfunctions-as-sets are extensional objects.\n\nIn contrast, the notion of a function at work in \\(\\lambda\\)-calculus\nis one where functions are understood as rules: a function is\ngiven by a rule for how to determine its values from its arguments.\nMore specifically, we can view a \\(\\lambda\\)-term \\(\\lambda x[M]\\) as\na description of an operation that, given \\(x\\), produces \\(M\\); the\nbody \\(M\\) of the abstraction term is, essentially, a rule\nfor what to do with \\(x\\). This is the conception of\nfunctions-as-rules. Intuitively, given rules\n\\(M\\) and \\(N\\), we cannot in general decide whether \\(\\lambda x[M]\\)\nis equal to \\(\\lambda x[N]\\). The two terms might \u2018behave\u2019\nthe same (have the same value given the same arguments), but it may\nnot be clear what resources are needed for showing the equality of the\nterms. In this sense, functions-as-rules are non-extensional\nobjects.\n\nTo distinguish the extensional concept of functions-as-sets from the\nnon-extensional concept of functions-as-rules, the latter is often\nreferred to as an \u2018intensional\u2019 function concept,\nin part because of the ostensibly intensional concept of a rule\ninvolved. This terminology is particularly predominant in the\ncommunity of mathematical logicians and philosophers of mathematics\nworking on the foundations of mathematics. But from the perspective of\nthe philosophy of language, the terminology can be somewhat\nmisleading, since in this context, the extensional-intensional\ndistinction has a slightly different meaning.\n\nIn the standard possible-worlds framework of philosophical semantics,\nwe would distinguish between an extensional and an intensional\nfunction concept as follows. Let us say that two functions are\nextensionally equivalent at a world if and only if they\nassign the same values to the same arguments at that world. And let us\nsay that two functions are intensionally equivalent if and\nonly if they assign the same values to the same arguments at\nevery possible-world. To illustrate, consider the functions\nhighest-mountain-on-earth and\nhighest-mountain-in-the-Himalayas,\nwhere highest-mountain-on-earth\nassigns\nthe highest mountain on earth as the value to every argument and highest-mountain-in-the-Himalayas\nassigns the highest mountain in the Himalayas as the value to every\nargument. The two functions are extensionally equivalent (at the\nactual world), but not intensionally so. At the actual world, the two\nfunctions assign the same value to every argument, namely Mt. Everest.\nNow consider a world where Mt. Everest is not the highest mountain on\nearth, but say, Mt. Rushmore is. Suppose further that this is so, just\nbecause Mt. Rushmore is 30.000 feet/9.100 m higher than it is at the\nactual world, while Mt. Everest, with its roughly 29.000 feet/8.800 m,\nis still the highest mountain in the Himalayas. At that world, highest-mountain-on-earth\nnow\nassigns Mt. Rushmore as the value to every argument, while highest-mountain-in-the-Himalayas\nstill assigns Mt. Everest to every object. In other words, highest-mountain-on-earth\nand highest-mountain-in-the-Himalayas\nare extensionally equivalent (at the actual world) but not\nintensionally equivalent.\n\nA function concept may now be called extensional if and only\nif it requires functions that are extensionally equivalent at the\nactual world to be identical. And a function concept may be classified\nas intensional if and only if it requires intensionally\nequivalent functions to be identical. Note that these classifications\nare conceptually different from the distinctions commonly used in the\nfoundations of mathematics. On the terminology used in the foundations\nof mathematics, functions-as-sets are classified as extensional since\nthey use the axiom of extensionality as their criterion of identity,\nand functions-as-rules are classified as intensional because they rely\non the ostensibly intensional concept of a rule. In the present\npossible-worlds terminology, function concepts are classified as\nextensional or intensional based of their behavior at\npossible-worlds.\n\nAn issue from which conceptual confusion might arise is that the two\nterminologies potentially pass different verdicts on the function\nconcept at work in the \\(\\lambda\\)-calculus. To see this, consider the\nfollowing two functions: \n\\[\\begin{align}\n\\addone &:= \\lambda x[x+1] \\\\\n\\addtwosubtractone &:= \\lambda x[[x+2]-1] \n\\end{align}\\]\n\n\nThese two functions are clearly extensionally equivalent: they assign\nthe same value to the same input at the actual world. Moreover, given\nstandard assumptions in possible worlds semantics, the two functions\nare also intensionally equivalent. If we assume that\nmathematical facts, like facts about addition and subtraction, are\nnecessary in the sense that they are the same at every possible world,\nthen we get that the two functions give the same value to the\narguments at every possible world. So, an intensional\nfunction concept would require the two functions to be identical. In\nthe \\(\\lambda\\)-calculus, however, it\u2019s not clear at all that we\nshould identify the two functions. Formally speaking, without the help\nof some other principle, we cannot show that the two \\(\\lambda\\)-terms\ndenote the same function. Moreover, informally speaking, on the\nconception of functions-as-rules, it\u2019s not even clear\nthat we should identify them: the two terms involve genuinely\ndifferent rules, and so we might be tempted to say that they denote\ndifferent functions.\n\nA function concept that allows for intensionally equivalent functions\nto be distinct is called hyperintensional.\nThe point is that in possible-worlds terminology, the function concept\nat work in the \\(\\lambda\\)-calculus may be regarded not as intentional\nbut hyperintensional\u2014in contrast to what the\nterminology common in the foundations of mathematics says. Note that\nit\u2019s unclear how an intensional semantic framework, like the\npossible-worlds framework, could even in principle account for a\nnon-intensional function concept. On the semantics of the\n\\(\\lambda\\)-calculus, see section\n 7.\n The point here was simply to clarify any conceptual confusions that\nmight arise from different terminologies at play in philosophical\ndiscourse.\n\nThe hyperintensionality of the \\(\\lambda\\)-calculus is particularly\nimportant when it comes to its applications as a theory of not only\nfunctions, but more generally \\(n\\)-ary relations. On this,\nsee section\n 9.3.\n It is effectively the hyperintensionality of the \\(\\lambda\\)-calculus\nthat makes it an attractive tool in this context. It should be noted,\nhowever, that the \\(\\lambda\\)-calculus can be made extensional (as\nwell as intensional) by postulating additional laws concerning the\nequality of \\(\\lambda\\)-terms. On this, see section\n 5.\n",
