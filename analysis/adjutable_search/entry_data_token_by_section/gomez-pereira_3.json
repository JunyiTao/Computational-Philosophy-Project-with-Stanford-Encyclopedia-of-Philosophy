    "main_text": "Psychology || The Body-soul compound\n3.2 The Body-soul compound\n\nThis conception adopted by Pereira to explain the integral unity of\nthe rational soul needed to be developed to explain the integral unity\nof the human being. Many of his statements, both in the\nAntoniana and in the Apologia, pointed out that the\nhuman being is not only the soul, but the conjunction of a body and a\nsoul (see, for example, AM: I.687, I.697, II.1077, II.1149). In fact,\nhe never abandoned the formal relationship that the rational soul has\nwith regard to the body (see Gonz\u00e1lez Vila 1975: 41).  However,\nthe concept of form used by Pereira permitted him to speak of a\nplurality of forms in a single subject (as many Averroists defended:\nsee above). For him, the unity of a compound is not given by\nthe uniqueness of a substantial form, but by the hierarchy of\nseveral forms under a superior one that gives the compound its\nultimate denomination. In a human, who is the most complex being of\ncreation, there would be a compound of compounds. Therefore, the\nrational soul is not the only substantial form in him, although it is\nthe only human form since it crowns that hierarchy of forms\nand confers to the whole human being his nature and\ndenomination. Pereira defended what can be considered a\ndynamic hylomorphism which was surely built on his own\nbiological experience as a doctor. However, the body-soul union of\nwhich the Spanish physician spoke in his Antoniana can hardly\nbe considered substantial sensu stricto, mainly because in\nhis book there is no detailed explanation of the relation of the soul\nto the body, or of what kind of union there is between two natures so\ndifferent in themselves. For him it is a factum that in human\nbeings these two natures converge, but he failed to explain this\nquestion \u2013 probably for the sake of a coherence that was perhaps\nimpossible.\n\n\nIt is curious that many of his contemporaries tried to respond to the\nchallenge of proving the immortality of the soul by appealing to\ncoherence, precisely when the Alexandrists emphasized that the\ncoherence of Aristotle was placed in mortality: every substantial form\nis born and perishes with the compound to which it gives the\nessence. Pereira was then not original when he tried to respond to\nPomponazzi\u2019s mortalist thesis by resorting to an alternative\ncoherence based on the radical separation of body and mind. But, in\nthis attempt, he showed, probably as no one before, that the\nhylomorphic explanatory scheme applied to the nature of the human\nbeing led to an unavoidable crossroads: one path ended in an integral\nmaterialism, the other in a strict dualism. Those who chose this last\nroad, as Pereira undoubtedly did, had a peremptory question before\nthem: what is the body for? For Pereira the body was a datum of\nexperience whose negation would have been contrary to the principles\nupon which he wished to sustain his work, i.e., experience and logical\ncoherence. His response came through the allegory of an imprisoned man\n(AM: II.1067). The soul is like a man inside a reticular sheath. This\nman cannot know anything at all if he is not \u201cawakened\u201d by\nthe blows that fall on the surrounding sheath from outside. Such blows\nor affections produced by external realities are necessary for the man\nwrapped in such a sheath to awaken and know, but they are not enough\nto explain knowledge itself. Thus, for Pereira the body is a kind of\n\u201calarm clock\u201d of the soul. This corporeal affection is\nrequired pro statu isto (i.e., the state of union body-soul)\nas conditio sine qua non of human understanding. But it is no\nless true that for Pereira the soul outside this sheath-jail would be\npermanently awake and would possess a more perfect knowledge of itself\nas well as of the other objects. Unfortunately, Pereira did not\nexplain at any time why the soul has to be in such a deplorable state:\nforgetful of itself, and aware only when it is unpleasantly excited by\nexternal stimuli. The tone in which Pereira referred to the situation\nof the incarnated soul shows us the most pessimistic version of an\nanthropological dualism: the knowledge that the soul is capable of\nachieving in this life is only a pale reflection of the one it can\nreach in the other. If, as Pereira seems to think, the soul is\nessentially self-consciousness, this nature can be reached here only\nindirectly, and for a limited time. But Pereira told us nothing of the\nmetaphysical framework that would be needed to explain what universal\norder allows a reality of a higher nature to be restricted in this\nway. If the death of the compound involves the reunion of the soul\nwith its true condition (\u201ccorrupto carcere statim in totum\nexpergiscetur\u201d/\u201conce his prison was destroyed he\nwould be completely awake\u201d AM: II.1068/1069), why should it\nsuffer the unfortunate restrictions to which it is subjected in the\nbody?  Although he wanted to deal with the issue of the soul\u2019s\nimmortality from the point of view of natural reason, in the end it\nwas necessary to transcend the physical realm to give a full\nexplanation of the fact that two natures as different as the spirit\nand the body cohabit in human beings.\n",
