    "main_text": "\n\nIn political theory and philosophy, the term\n\u2018republicanism\u2019 is generally used in two different, but\nclosely related, senses. In the first sense, republicanism refers to a\nloose tradition or family of writers in the history of western\npolitical thought, including especially: Machiavelli and his\nfifteenth-century Italian predecessors; the English republicans\nMilton, Harrington, Sidney, and others; Montesquieu and Blackstone;\nthe eighteenth-century English commonwealthmen; and many Americans of\nthe founding era such as Jefferson, Madison, and Adams. The writers in\nthis tradition emphasize many common ideas and concerns, such as the\nimportance of civic virtue and political participation, the dangers of\ncorruption, the benefits of a mixed constitution and the rule of law,\netc.; and it is characteristic of their rhetorical style to draw\nheavily on classical examples\u2014from Cicero and the Latin\nhistorians especially\u2014in presenting their arguments. In light of\nthe last point, this is sometimes referred to as the \u2018classical\nrepublican\u2019 or \u2018neo-roman\u2019 tradition in political\nthought.\n\nBeyond this brief sketch, there exists considerable historiographical\ncontroversy\u2014with respect to who the tradition\u2019s members\nare, and their relative significance; with respect to how we should\ninterpret its underlying philosophical commitments; and with respect\nto its role (especially vis-\u00e0-vis liberalism) in the historical\ndevelopment of modern political thought. This brings us to the second\nsense of the term \u2018republicanism\u2019. In contemporary\npolitical theory and philosophy, it most often refers to a specific\n(and still contested) interpretation of the classical republican\ntradition, associated especially with the work of Quentin Skinner;\ntogether with a research program dedicated to developing insights from\nthis tradition into an attractive contemporary political doctrine,\nassociated especially with the work of Philip Pettit. According to\nrepublicans in this second sense (sometimes called \u2018civic\nrepublicans\u2019 or \u2018neo-republicans\u2019), the paramount\nrepublican value is political liberty, understood as non-domination or\nindependence from arbitrary power. This entry will primarily discuss\nrepublicanism in this second sense.\n\nIn their interpretation of the classical republicanism tradition,\ncivic republicans are often in debate with civic humanists, with whom\nthey are often confused (see the entry on\n civic humanism).\n Developed as a contemporary political doctrine, civic republicanism\nis broadly speaking progressive and liberal, but not without important\ndistinctive features. Some of its policy implications diverge from\nmainstream liberalism in particular ways, and for this reason civic\nrepublicans are sometimes also confused with communitarians (see the\nentry on\n communitarianism).\n For the strengths or weakness of civic republicanism to be fairly\nassessed, both confusions should be assiduously avoided.\n",
