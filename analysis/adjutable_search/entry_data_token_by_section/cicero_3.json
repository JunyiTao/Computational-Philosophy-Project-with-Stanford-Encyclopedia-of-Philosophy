    "main_text": "Philosophy and Oratory\n4. Philosophy and Oratory\n\nCicero\u2019s main philosophical production can be divided into two\nchronological periods. The first, from around 54\u201351 BCE, sees\nthe writing of his two main works of political philosophy, the\nRepublic and the Laws (the latter apparently\nunfinished), each loosely based on a Platonic archetype, together with\nhis great work on the nature and role of oratory, On the\nOrator. The second period, during which he composed the greater\npart of his philosophical oeuvre, occurred in an astonishing two-year\nburst of creativity towards the end of his life, in 45 and 44.\nAlthough Cicero\u2019s writings on oratory (he composed several works\non the topic) will not be discussed here, they should not be regarded\nas entirely distinct from his philosophical writings. That is because\nthe relation between philosophy and oratory was of central importance\nto him. While this might sound arcane to a modern ear, what it\nencapsulated for Cicero was the vital question of how philosophy is\nbest communicated.\n\nIn the Gorgias, Plato had Socrates mount a passionate attack\non rhetoric, by contrast with philosophy, as concerned with mere\npersuasion rather than truth. For Cicero, as probably the supreme\norator of his day, matters could not be that simple. The use of speech\nto manipulate others for self-serving ends could not, of course, be\ncondoned. But the idea that pure reasoning, divorced from\ncommunicative skill, was sufficient to win people round to philosophy\nstruck Cicero as, if anything, even more dangerously misguided. The\nresources of oratory must be recruited to the vital enterprise of\ndisseminating philosophy to new audiences. Cicero often shows himself\nacutely conscious of criticism that a practical Roman should so much\nas attempt to write philosophy. By writing it in a way that was not\nalienating to its potential audience, he could aspire to draw his\ncritics in despite themselves.\n",
