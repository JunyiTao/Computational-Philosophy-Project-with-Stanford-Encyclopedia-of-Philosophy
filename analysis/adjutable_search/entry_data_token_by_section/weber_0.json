    "main_text": "Life and Career\n1. Life and Career\n\nMaximilian Carl Emil \u201cMax\u201d Weber (1864\u20131920) was\nborn in the Prussian city of Erfurt to a family of notable heritage.\nHis father, Max Sr., came from a Westphalian family of merchants and\nindustrialists in the textile business and went on to become a lawyer\nand National Liberal parliamentarian in Wilhelmine politics. His\nmother, Helene, came from the Fallenstein and Souchay families, both\nof the long illustrious Huguenot line, which had for generations\nproduced public servants and academicians. His younger brother,\nAlfred, was an influential political economist and sociologist, too.\nEvidently, Max Weber was brought up in a prosperous, cosmopolitan, and\ncultivated family milieu that was well-plugged into the political,\nsocial, and cultural establishment of the German\nB\u00fcrgertum [Roth 2000]. Also, his parents represented\ntwo, often conflicting, poles of identity between which their eldest\nson would struggle throughout his life \u2013 worldly statesmanship\nand ascetic scholarship.\n\nEducated mainly at the universities of Heidelberg and Berlin, Weber\nwas trained in law, eventually writing his dissertation on medieval\ntrading companies under Levin Goldschmidt and Rudolf von Gneist (and\nexamined by Theodor Mommsen) and Habilitationsschrift on\nRoman law and agrarian history under August Meitzen. While\ncontemplating a career in legal practice and public service, he\nreceived an important research commission from the Verein f\u00fcr\nSozialpolitik (the leading social science association under\nGustav Schmoller\u2019s leadership) and produced the so-called East\nElbian Report on the displacement of the German agrarian workers in\nEast Prussia by Polish migrant labours. Greeted upon publication with\nhigh acclaim and political controversy, this early success led to his\nfirst university appointment at Freiburg in 1894 to be followed by a\nprestigious professorship in political economy at Heidelberg two years\nlater. Weber and his wife Marianne, an intellectual in her own right\nand early women\u2019s rights activist, soon found themselves at the\ncenter of the vibrant intellectual and cultural life of Heidelberg.\nThe so-called \u201cWeber Circle\u201d attracted such intellectual\nluminaries as Georg Jellinek, Ernst Troeltsch, and Werner Sombart and\nlater a number of younger scholars including Marc Bloch, Robert\nMichels, and Gy\u00f6rgy Luk\u00e1cs. Weber was also active in\npublic life as he continued to play an important role as a Young Turk\nin the Verein and maintain a close association with the\nliberal Evangelische-soziale Kongress (especially with the\nleader of its younger generation, Friedrich Naumann). It was during\nthis time that he solidified his reputation as a brilliant political\neconomist and outspoken public intellectual.\n\nAll these fruitful years came to an abrupt halt in 1897 when Weber\ncollapsed with a nervous-breakdown shortly after his father\u2019s\nsudden death (precipitated by a confrontation with Weber) [Radkau\n2011, 53\u201369]. His routine as a teacher and scholar was\ninterrupted so badly that he eventually withdrew from regular teaching\nduties in 1903, to which he would not return until 1919. Although\nseverely compromised and unable to write as prolifically as before, he\nstill managed to immerse himself in the study of various philosophical\nand religious topics. This period saw a new direction in his\nscholarship as the publication of miscellaneous methodological essays\nas well as The Protestant Ethic and the Spirit of Capitalism\n(1904\u20131905) testifies. Also noteworthy about this period is his\nextensive trip to America in 1904, which left an indelible trace in\nhis understanding of modernity in general [Scaff 2011].\n\nAfter this stint essentially as a private scholar, he slowly resumed\nhis participation in various academic and public activities. With\nEdgar Jaff\u00e9 and Sombart, he took over editorial control of the\nArchiv f\u00fcr Sozialwissenschaften und Sozialpolitik,\nturning it into a leading social science journal of the day as well as\nhis new institutional platform. In 1909, he co-founded the\nDeutsche Gesellschaft f\u00fcr Soziologie, in part as a\nresult of his growing unease with the Verein\u2019s\nconservative politics and lack of methodological discipline, becoming\nits first treasurer (he would resign from it in 1912, though). This\nperiod of his life, until interrupted by the outbreak of the First\nWorld War in 1914, brought the pinnacles of his achievements as he\nworked intensely in two areas \u2013 the comparative sociology of\nworld religions and his contributions to the Grundriss der\nSozial\u00f6konomik (to be published posthumously as Economy\nand Society). Along with the major methodological essays that he\ndrafted during this time, these works would become mainly responsible\nfor Weber\u2019s enduring reputation as one of the founding fathers\nof modern social science.\n\nWith the onset of the First World War, Weber\u2019s involvement in\npublic life took an unexpected turn. At first a fervent patriotic\nsupporter of the war, as virtually all German intellectuals of the\ntime were, he grew disillusioned with the German war policies,\neventually refashioning himself as one of the most vocal critics of\nthe Kaiser government in a time of war. As a public intellectual, he\nissued private reports to government leaders and wrote journalistic\npieces to warn against the Belgian annexation policy and the unlimited\nsubmarine warfare, which, as the war deepened, evolved into a call for\noverall democratization of the authoritarian state\n(Obrigkeitsstaat) that was Wilhelmine Germany. By 1917, Weber\nwas campaigning vigorously for a wholesale constitutional reform for\npost-war Germany, including the introduction of universal suffrage and\nthe empowerment of parliament.\n\nWhen defeat came in 1918, Germany found in Weber a public intellectual\nleader, even possibly a future statesman, with unscathed liberal\ncredentials who was well-positioned to influence the course of\npost-war reconstruction. He was invited to join the draft board of the\nWeimar Constitution as well as the German delegation to Versaille;\nalbeit in vain, he even ran for a parliamentary seat on the liberal\nDemocratic Party ticket. In those capacities, however, he opposed the\nGerman Revolution (all too sensibly) and the Versaille Treaty (all too\nquixotically) alike, putting himself in an unsustainable position that\ndefied the partisan alignments of the day. By all accounts, his\npolitical activities bore little fruit, except his advocacy for a\nrobust plebiscitary presidency in the Weimar Constitution.\n\nFrustrated with day-to-day politics, he turned to his scholarly\npursuits with renewed vigour. In 1919, he briefly taught in turn at\nthe universities of Vienna (General Economic History was an\noutcome of this experience) and Munich (where he gave the much-lauded\nlectures, Science as a Vocation and Politics as a\nVocation), while compiling his scattered writings on religion in\nthe form of massive three-volume Gesammelte Aufs\u00e4tze zur\nReligionssoziologie [GARS hereafter]. All these\nreinvigorated scholarly activities came to an end in 1920 when he died\nsuddenly of pneumonia in Munich (likely due to the Spanish flu). Max\nWeber was fifty-six years old.\n",
