    "main_text": "Evaluating a Theatrical Performance\n4. Evaluating a Theatrical Performance\n\nAgainst the background in\n \u00a72.2\n and\n \u00a73,\n it seems clear that to evaluate an instance of theater demands a\ndecision on the part of the evaluator: to evaluate either the text (as\nan instance of dramatic literature), the performance or production (as\nan instance of a public event), or both of them in relation to each\nother. If both, the evaluator is able to consider the intersection\nbetween performance or production and text, to assess the performance\nor production in relation to the text and to assess the text\nagainst the performance of it. Despite their disagreements on the\nontology of the art form and the pattern such an ontology should take,\ncriticism of both text and performance is what Carroll, Saltz, and\nHamilton all appear to have in mind (Saltz, Hamilton, and Carroll\n2001). Moreover, this appears to be congruent with the practices of\ncritics as well.\n\nBefore discussing how this is to be done, however, there are two major\nissues about criticism, or \u201cevaluation\u201d, of any works of\nart that should be described. For both of them will affect how to\nunderstand the evaluation of theatrical performances.\n",
