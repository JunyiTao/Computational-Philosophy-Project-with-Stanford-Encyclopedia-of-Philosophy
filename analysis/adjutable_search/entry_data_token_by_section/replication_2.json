    "main_text": "Dawkins\u2019 View\n3. Dawkins\u2019 View\n\nRichard Dawkins introduced the distinction between replicators and\nvehicles in The Selfish Gene (1976). For his purposes,\nDawkins found the contrast between genes and organisms too restrictive\nand specific. Everyone agrees that genes are replicators, but genes\nmay not be the only replicators. Dawkins also argued that perhaps more\ninclusive entities than single genes might also function as\nreplicators. At the very least, the possibility should not be ignored.\nSo, Dawkins adopted \u201creplicator\u201d as a more inclusive and\ngeneral term than \u201cgene\u201d. In The Extended\nPhenotype, he defined a replicator as \u201canything in the\nuniverse of which copies are made\u201d (Dawkins 1982b: 83). He also\nintroduced the term \u201cvehicle\u201d for those entities produced\nby replicators that help these replicators increase in numbers by\ninteracting effectively with their environments. This distinction can\nbe expressed in terms of either entities or processes. According to\nDawkins, replicators function in replication, while vehicles function\nin environmental interaction.\n",
