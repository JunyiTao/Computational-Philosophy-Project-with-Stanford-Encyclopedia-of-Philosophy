Arriving at the Repugnant Conclusion\n\nParfit is not the first philosopher to have noticed that influential\nmoral views may have implications of the sort outlined in the\nRepugnant Conclusion. Henry Sidgwick was close to acknowledging the\nimplication when he pointed out that \u201c\u2026 the point up to\nwhich, on utilitarian principles, population ought to be encouraged to\nincrease, is not that at which the average happiness is the greatest\npossible\u2014as appears to be often assumed by political economists\nof the school of Malthus\u2014but that at which the happiness reaches\nits maximum\u201d (Sidgwick 1907 p. 418; for other early sources, see\nBroad 1930 pp. 249\u2013250; McTaggart 1927 pp. 452\u201353;\nNarveson 1967). However, it is Parfit who has brought the conclusion\nto recent philosophical attention both by stressing the importance of\nthe conclusion and by showing how difficult it is to avoid it (Parfit\n1984).\n\nParfit was led to the Repugnant Conclusion by his considerations\nconcerning how we ought to act in cases where our decisions have an\nimpact on who will exist in the future. Consider the following two\nscenarios (see Parfit 1984 chapter 16):\n\nA pregnant mother suffers from an illness which, unless she\nundergoes a simple treatment, will cause her child to suffer a\npermanent handicap. If she receives the treatment and is cured her\nchild will be perfectly normal.\nA woman suffers from an illness which means that, if she gets\npregnant now, her child will suffer from a permanent handicap. If she\npostpones her pregnancy a few months until she has recovered, her\nchild will be perfectly normal.\n\n\nWhat ought the women to do in the two cases? In case (1) the obvious\nanswer is that the mother ought to undergo the treatment since her\nchild will thereby get a better life. However, when we turn to case\n(2), it is problematic to appeal to the improved life of some child as\nthe reason for taking action (i.e., postponing the pregnancy). If the\nwoman postpones her pregnancy, then the child that is brought into\nexistence will not be identical to the child she would have had, had\nshe decided to become pregnant while she was ill (it will not be the\nsame ovum and sperm that meet). Hence, the alternative for the child\nbrought into existence during the mother\u2019s illness is\nnon-existence, and to claim that it would have been better for this\nchild if the mother had postponed pregnancy is tantamount to claiming\nthat the child\u2019s non-existence would have been better for the\nchild. Assuming that the child would have a life worth living, this\nseems wrong if not nonsensical. Indeed, in case (2), there are two\nhypothetical children and whether or not the mother postpones the\npregnancy, neither child will have a \u201cbetter life\u201d as a\nresult of the mother\u2019s action. For both hypothetical children,\nthe alternative is nonexistence. If the mother postpones her pregnancy\nwhile ill, the first child wouldn\u2019t exist, and if she\ndoesn\u2019t postpone, the second child wouldn\u2019t exist. (For a\ndiscussion, see Narveson 1967, Parfit 1984, appendix G; Adler 2012;\nBykvist 2007c, 2015; Arrhenius & Rabinowicz 2015, McMahan 1981,\n2009, 2013; Rabinowicz 2009; Holtug 2010; Fleurbaey & Voorhoeve\n2015). \n\nHow, if at all, should a change in the identity of the involved\nparties in the compared outcomes affect our moral evaluation? Parfit\nrefers to this as \u201cthe Non-Identity Problem\u201d (see the\nentry on\n the nonidentity problem).\n Following what would probably strike most people as the most\nplausible answer Parfit favors what he calls the \u201cNo-Difference\nView\u201d (1984 p. 367), which implies that a change in identity\nshould not affect the answer: the woman in case (2) ought to postpone\nher pregnancy, just as the woman in case (1) ought to undergo the\ntreatment. A straightforward way of capturing the No-Difference View\nis total utilitarianism according to which the best outcome is the one\nin which there would be the greatest quantity of whatever makes life\nworth living (Parfit 1984 p. 387). However, this view implies that any\nloss in the quality of lives in a population can be compensated for by\na sufficient gain in the quantity of a population; that is, it leads\nto the Repugnant Conclusion. Consider the following diagram:\n\n\n\nFigure 1\n\n\nThe blocks above represent two populations, A and Z. The\nwidth of each block shows the number of people in the corresponding\npopulation, the height shows their quality of life or lifetime\nwelfare. All the lives in the above diagram have lives worth living.\nPeople\u2019s quality of life is much lower in Z than in\nA but, since there are many more people in Z, there is a\ngreater quantity of welfare in Z as compared to A.\nConsequently, although the people in A lead very good lives and\nthe people in Z have lives only barely worth living, Z\nis nevertheless better than A according to total\nutilitarianism. Thus, the attempt to provide a plausible solution to\nthe Non-Identity Problem has led to a seemingly unacceptable\nconclusion.\n\nLeaving the Non-Identity Problem aside, there are other arguments\nestablishing that the Repugnant Conclusion is not easily avoided.\nParfit has developed an argument to this effect. Consider the three\npopulation scenarios indicated in Fig. 2.\n\n\n\nFigure 2\n\n\nIn population A, everybody enjoys a very high quality of life.\nIn population A+ there is one group of people as large as the\ngroup in A and with the same high quality of life. But\nA+ also contains a number of people with a somewhat lower\nquality of life. In Parfit\u2019s terminology A+ is generated\nfrom A by \u201cmere addition\u201d. Comparing A and\nA+ it is reasonable to hold that A+ is better than\nA or, at least, not worse. The idea is that an addition of\nlives worth living cannot make a population worse. Consider the next\npopulation B with the same number of people as A+, all\nleading lives worth living and at an average welfare level slightly\nabove the average in A+, but lower than the average in\nA. It is hard to deny that B is better than A+\nsince it is better in regard to both average welfare (and thus also\ntotal welfare) and equality. However, if A+ is at least not\nworse than A, and if B is better than A+, then\nB is also better than A given full comparability among\npopulations (i.e., setting aside possible incomparabilities among\npopulations). By parity of reasoning (scenario B+ and C,\nC+ etc.), we end up with a population Z in which all\nlives have a very low positive welfare. Thus, the final conclusion is\nthat Z is better than A, which is the Repugnant\nConclusion. By what apparently constitute sound steps of reasoning we\nhave arrived at an absurd conclusion. This is paradoxical. Thus, is\n\u2018mere\u2019 addition innocuous, as is here assumed? Well, if it\nis thought to be suspicious, there is a way of avoiding it by starting\nwith a population like the one in A and adding new people\nliving at a slightly lower level than the people in A in a\nmanner that increases the well-being of existing people. You\nthen proceed down the moral alphabet by levelling out the well-being\nbetween the best and worst off in a manner that gives more to those\nwho are worst off than you take from those who are best off; in each\nstep new people are added, in order to make this change of the\nsituation possible (Parfit 1984; T\u00e4nnsj\u00f6 2002). Moreover,\nthere are other abstract arguments leading in the same direction, some\nof them presented by Parfit himself (see section 2.5 and 2.7). It\nseems then that the Repugnant Conclusion is very hard to get\naround.\n\nThe main challenge which Parfit presented in his celebrated work\nReasons and Persons is to develop a theory of\nbeneficence\u2014theory X he calls it\u2014which is able to solve\nthe Non-Identity problem, which does not lead to the Repugnant\nConclusion and which thus manages to block the Mere Addition Paradox,\nwithout facing other unacceptable conclusions. However, Parfit\u2019s\nown conclusion was that he had not succeeded in developing such a\ntheory.\n\nIt might be tempting for people who have little sympathy with\nutilitarian thought to try to set the problems raised by the Repugnant\nConclusion to the side, thinking that it constitutes a problem only\nfor utilitarians. However, most people tend to believe that we have\nsome obligation to make the world a better place, at least if\nwe can do so without violating any deontological constraints, and at a\nnot too high cost to ourselves. Clearly all who think along these\nlines, even without being utilitarians, are faced with the problem of\nthe Repugnant Conclusion. We can assume that other values and\nconsiderations are not decisive for the choice between populations\nA and Z in Figure 1 (e.g., promises, rights). The\nRepugnant Conclusion is a problem for all moral theories which hold\nthat welfare at least matters when all other things are equal.\n",
