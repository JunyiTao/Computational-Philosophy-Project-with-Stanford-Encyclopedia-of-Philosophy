    "main_text": "\n\nNicolaus Copernicus (1473\u20131543) was a mathematician and\nastronomer who proposed that the sun was stationary in the center of\nthe universe and the earth revolved around it. Disturbed by the\nfailure of Ptolemy\u2019s geocentric model of the universe to follow\nAristotle\u2019s requirement for the uniform circular motion of all\ncelestial bodies. Copernicus decided that he could achieve his goal\nonly through a heliocentric model. He thereby created a concept of a\nuniverse in which the distances of the planets from the sun bore a\ndirect relationship to the size of their orbits. At the time\nCopernicus\u2019s heliocentric idea was very controversial;\nnevertheless, it was the start of a change in the way the world was\nviewed, and Copernicus came to be seen as the initiator of what is\ncommonly known as the Scientific Revolution.\n",
