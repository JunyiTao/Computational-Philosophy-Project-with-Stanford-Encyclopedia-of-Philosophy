In other\nwords, it should not be confused with another relation involving\nnegation, namely mutual implication (tal\u0101zum). The\ncontradictory of a conditional a-proposition is a conditional\no-proposition with the same antecedent and consequent and the\ncontradictory of a conditional e-proposition is a conditional\ni-proposition with the same antecedent and consequent. The same\napplies to the case of disjunctions.\n\nAvicenna is keen to point out on various occasions throughout the\ntreatment of conditionals in the Qiy\u0101s that what matters\nare the quantificational aspects of the relation between\nantecedent and consequent (the nisba or the\n\u1e25ukm), not the quantity and quality of the antecedent\nand consequent themselves. In particular, he vigorously rejects the\nview that the contradictory of a conditional statement is a\nconditional statement of the same quality and quantity whose\nconsequent is denied. In his view, the contradictory of (a-\\(\\mathbb{C}\\))aa is\n (o-\\(\\mathbb{C}\\))aa, not (a-\\(\\mathbb{C}\\))ao. In other words, \u201cAlways, if every A is B,\nthen every C is D\u201d is contradicted by \u201cNot always, if every A is\nB, then every C is D\u201d and not by \u201cAlways, if every A is B, then not every C is D\u201d which is in fact a stronger statement equivalent to its contrary, namely  (e-\\(\\mathbb{C}\\))aa (\u201cNever, if every A is B, then every C is D\u201d).[10]\nOn the other hand, (o-\\(\\mathbb{C}\\))aa is logically equivalent to (i-\\(\\mathbb{C}\\))ao\n(\u201cSometimes, if every A is B, then not every C is D\u201d),\nwhich is therefore another contradictory of (a-\\(\\mathbb{C}\\))aa. A set of basic relations is represented in the\nfollowing diagram\n\n\n\nFigure 3: Relations among conditionals: mutual implication, subalternation, contrariety, and contradiction) \n\n",
