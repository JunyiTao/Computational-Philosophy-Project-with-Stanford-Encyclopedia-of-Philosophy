According to Anselm and the Augustinians generally, no\npunishment that a sinner might endure over a finite period of time can\njustly compensate for the slightest offense against God. Anselm thus\nspeculated that if no suffering of finite duration will fully\nsatisfy the demands of justice, perhaps suffering of infinite\nduration will do the trick. But the truth, according to many critics,\nis that no suffering and no punishment of any duration could\nin and of itself compensate for someone\u2019s wrongdoing.\nIn the right circumstances punishment might be a means to something\nthat satisfies the demands of justice, but it has no power to do so in\nand of itself. The Victorian visionary George MacDonald thus put it\nthis way: \u201cPunishment, or deserved suffering, is no equipoise to\nsin. It is no use laying it on the other scale. It will not move it a\nhair\u2019s breadth. Suffering weighs nothing at all against\nsin\u201d (MacDonald 1889, 510). Why not? Because punishment, whether\nit consists of additional suffering or a painless annihilation, does\nnothing in and of itself, MacDonald insisted, to cancel out a sin, to\ncompensate or to make up for it, to repair the harm that it brings\ninto our lives, or to heal the estrangement that makes it possible in\nthe first\n place.[5]\n Neither does it justify God\u2019s decision to permit the wrongdoing\nin the first place.\n\nSo what, theoretically, would make things right or fully\nsatisfy justice in the event that someone should commit murder or\notherwise act wrongly? Whereas the Augustinians insist that justice\nrequires punishment, other religious writers insist that justice\nrequires something very different, namely reconciliation and\nrestoration (see, for example, Marshall, 2001). Only God,\nhowever, has the power to achieve true restoration in the case of\nmurder, because divine omnipotence can resurrect the victims of murder\njust as easily as it can the victims of old age. According to George\nMacDonald, whose religious vision was almost the polar opposite of the\nAugustinian vision, perfect justice therefore requires,\nfirst, that sinners repent of their sin and turn away from everything\nthat would separate them from God and from others; it requires,\nsecond, that God forgive repentant sinners and that they forgive each\nother; and it requires, third, that God overcome, perhaps with their\nown cooperation, any harm that sinners do either to others or to\nthemselves. Augustinians typically object to the idea that divine\njustice, no less than divine love, requires that God forgive sinners\nand undertake the divine toil of restoring a just order. But MacDonald\ninsisted that, even as human parents have an obligation to care for\ntheir children, so God has a freely accepted responsibility, as our\nCreator, to meet our moral and spiritual needs. God therefore\nowes us forgiveness for the same reason that human parents\nowe it to their children to forgive them in the event that\nthey misbehave. Of course, precisely because they do forgive their\nchildren, loving parents may sometimes punish their children and even\nhold the feet of a child to the proverbial fire when this seems\nnecessary for the child\u2019s own welfare. And if the time should\ncome when loving parents are required to respect the misguided choices\nof a rebellious teenager or an adult child, they will always stand\nready to restore fellowship with a prodigal son or daughter in the\nevent of a ruptured relationship.\n\nWe thus encounter two radically different religious visions of divine\njustice, both of which deserve a full and careful examination.\nAccording to the Augustinian vision, those condemned to hell are\nrecipients of divine justice but are not recipients of divine mercy;\nhence justice and mercy are, according to this vision, radically\ndifferent (perhaps even inconsistent) attributes of\n God.[6]\n But according to an alternative religious vision, as exemplified in\nthe work of George MacDonald 1889 and J.A.T. Robinson 1968,\nGod\u2019s justice and mercy are the very same attribute in this\nsense: divine justice is altogether merciful even as divine mercy is\naltogether just. \n3. Free-will Theodicies of Hell\n\nUnlike the Augustinians, Arminian theologians emphasize the role that\nfree will plays in determining one\u2019s eternal destiny in heaven\nor hell; they also accept the so-called libertarian understanding of\nfree will, according to which freedom and determinism are incompatible\n(see the entry on\n free will)).\n Because not even an omnipotent being can causally determine a\ngenuinely free choice, the reality of free will, they say, introduces\ninto the universe an element that, from God\u2019s perspective, is\nutterly random in that it lies outside of God\u2019s direct causal\ncontrol. Accordingly, if some person should freely act\nwrongly\u2014or worse yet, freely reject God\u2019s grace\u2014in a\ngiven set of circumstances, then it was not within God\u2019s power\nto induce this person to have freely acted otherwise, at least not in\nthe exact same circumstances in which the person was left free to act\nwrongly. So in that sense, our human free choices, particularly the\nbad ones, are genuine obstacles that God must work around in order to\nbring a set of loving purposes to fruition. And this may suggest the\nfurther possibility that, with respect to some free persons, God\ncannot both preserve their their libertarian freedom in the\nmatter and prevent them from freely continuing to reject God\nforever. As C. S. Lewis, an early 20th Century proponent of such a\ntheodicy, once put it, \u201cIn creating beings with free will,\nomnipotence from the outset submits to the possibility of \u2026\ndefeat. \u2026 I willingly believe that the damned are, in one\nsense, successful, rebels to the end; that the doors of hell are\nlocked on the inside\u201d (Lewis 1944, 115). \n\nThe basic idea here is that hell, along with the self imposed misery\nit entails, is essentially a freely embraced condition rather\nthan a forcibly imposed\n punishment;[7]\n and because freedom and determinism are incompatible, the creation of\nfree moral agents carries an inherent risk of ultimate tragedy.\nWhether essential to our personhood or not, free will is a precious\ngift, an expression of God\u2019s love for us; and because the very\nlove that seeks our salvation also respects our freedom, God will not\nprevent us from separating ourselves from him, even forever, if that\nis what we freely choose to do. So even though the perfectly loving\nGod would never reject anyone, sinners can reject God and thus freely\nseparate themselves from the divine nature; they not only have the\npower as free agents to reject God for a season, during the time when\nthey are mired in ambiguity and subject to illusion, but they are also\nable to cling forever to the illusions that make such rejection\npossible in the first place. \n\nBut why suppose it even possible that a free creature should freely\nreject forever the redemptive will of a perfectly loving and\ninfinitely resourceful God? In the relevant literature over the past\nseveral decades, advocates of a free-will theodicy of hell have\noffered at least three quite different answers to this question: \n\nPerhaps the most commonly expressed answer concerns the\npossibility of an irrevocable decision to reject God forever. Jerry\nWalls thus describes the damned as those who have made a decisive\nchoice of evil (see Walls 1992, Ch. 5), Richard Swinburne suggests\nthat \u201conce our will is fixed for bad, we shall never [again]\ndesire or seek what we have missed\u201d because we have made an\n\u201cirrevocable choice of character\u201d (Swinburne 1989, 199),\nand R. Zachary Manis interprets Kierkegaard, whose view he defends, as\nsuggesting that the \u201cdamned are so filled with hatred \u2026\nso motivated by malice and spite \u2026 that they will to remain in\ntheir state of torment, all for the sake of demonstrating that they\nare in the right, and that God is in the wrong\u201d (Manis 2016,\n290).\nAnother proposed answer rejects altogether the traditional idea\nthat those in hell are lost without any further hope of restoration.\nBuckareff and Plug (2005) have thus argued from the very nature of the\ndivine perfections (including perfect love) that God will always have\n\u201can open-door policy towards those in hell\u2014making it\n[always] possible for those in hell to escape\u201d (39); and\nsimilarly, Raymond VanArragon has argued that those in hell continue\nto reject God freely only if they retain the power to act otherwise\nand hence also the power to repent and be saved (see VanArragon 2010).\nBecause the damned never lose forever their libertarian freedom in\nrelation to God\u2019s offer of salvation, in other words, and never\nlose forever the psychological possibility of genuine repentance,\nthere is no irreversible finality in the so-called final\n judgment.[8]\n Still, the possibility remains, according to this view, that some\nwill never avail themselves of the opportunity to escape from hell.\n\nA third proposed answer rests upon a Molinist perspective,\naccording to which God\u2019s omniscience includes what philosophers\nnow call middle knowledge, which in turn includes far more than a\nsimple foreknowledge of a person\u2019s future free actions. It also\nincludes a perfect knowledge uf what a person would have done\nfreely in circumstances that will never even obtain. So with\nrespect to the decision whether or not to create a given person and to\nplace that person in a given set of circumstances, God can base this\ndecision in part on a knowledge of what the person would do freely if\ncreated and placed in these precise circumstances\u2014or if, for\nthat matter, the person were placed in any other possible set of\ncircumstances as well. From this Molinist perspective, William Lane\nCraig has defended the possibility that some free persons are utterly\nirredeemable in this sense: short of overriding their libertarian\nfreedom, nothing God might do for them\u2014whether it be to impart a\nspecial revelation. to administer an appropriate punishment, or to\nhelp them in some other way\u2014will ever win them over or persuade\nthem to repent as a means of becoming reconciled to God (Craig 1989).\nCraig himself calls this dreadful property of being irredeemable\ntransworld damnation (184).\n\n\nIn part because it rests upon the idea of middle knowledge, which is\nitself controversial, Craig\u2019s idea of transworld\ndamnation may be the most controversial idea that any proponent\nof a free will theodicy of hell has put forward. It also raises the\nquestion of why a morally perfect God would create someone (or\ninstantiate the individual essence of someone) whom God already knew\nin advance would be irredeemable. By way of an answer, Craig insists\non the possibility that some persons would submit to God freely only\nin a world in which others should damn themselves forever; it is even\npossible, he insists, that God must permit a large number of people to\ndamn themselves in order to fill heaven with a larger number of\nredeemed. Craig himself has put it this way:\n\nIt is possible that the terrible price of filling heaven is also\nfilling hell and that in any other possible world which was feasible\nfor God the balance between saved and lost was worse. It is possible\nthat had God actualized a world in which there are less persons in\nhell, there would also have been less persons in heaven. It is\npossible that in order to achieve this much blessedness, God was\nforced to accept this much loss (1989, 183).\n\n\nAs this passage illustrates, Craig accepts at least the possibility\nthat, because of free will, history includes an element of\nirreducible tragedy; he even accepts the possibility that if\nfewer people were damned to hell, then fewer people would have been\nsaved as well. So perhaps God knows from the outset that a complete\ntriumph over evil is unfeasible no matter what divine actions might be\ntaken; as a result, God merely tries to minimize the defeat, to cut\nthe losses, and in the process to fill heaven with more saints than\notherwise would have been feasible. (For a critique of this reply, see\nTalbott 1992; for Craig\u2019s rejoinder, see Craig 1993; and for a\ncritique of Craig\u2019s rejoinder, see Seymour 2000a.) \n\nIn any case, how one assesses each of the three answers above will\ndepend upon how one understands the idea of moral freedom and the role\nit plays, if any, in someone landing in either heaven or hell. The\nfirst two answers also represent a fundamental disagreement concerning\nthe existence of free will in hell and perhaps even the nature of free\nwill itself. According to the first answer, the inhabitants of hell\nare those who have freely acquired a consistently evil will and an\nirreversibly bad moral character. So for the rest of eternity, these\ninhabitants of hell do not even continue rejecting God freely\nin any sense that requires the psychological possibility of choosing\notherwise. But is such an irreversibly bad moral character even\ncoherent or metaphysically possible? Not according to the second\nanswer, which implies that a morally perfect God would never cease\nproviding those in hell with opportunities for repentance and\nproviding these opportunities in contexts where such repentance\nremains a genuine psychological possibility. All of which points once\nagain to the need for a clearer understanding of the nature and\npurpose of moral freedom. (See section 5.1 below for some additional\nissues that arise in connection with freedom in heaven and hell.) \n3.1 Moral Freedom and Rationality\n\nGiven the New Testament imagery associated with Gehenna, the Lake of\nFire, and the outer darkness\u2014where there is \u201cweeping and\ngnashing of teeth\u201d\u2014the question is not how\nsomeone in a context of ambiguity, ignorance, and misperception could\nfreely choose separation from the divine nature over union with it;\nthe question is instead how someone could both experience\nsuch separation (or the unbearable misery of hell, for example)\nand freely choose to remain in such a state forever. This is\nnot a problem for the Augustinians because, according to them, the\ndamned have no further choice in the matter once their everlasting\npunishment commences. But it is a problem for those free-will theists\nwho believe that the damned freely embrace an eternal destiny apart\nfrom God, and the latter view requires, at the very least, a plausible\naccount of the relevant freedom. \n\nNow, as already indicated, those who embrace a free-will theodicy of\nhell typically appeal, in the words of Jonathan Kvanvig, to \u201ca\nlibertarian account of human freedom in order to provide a complete\nresponse to\u201d the problem of hell (Kvanvig 2011, 54). But of\ncourse such a \u201ccomplete response\u201d would also require a\nrelatively complete account of libertarian freedom. According to\nKvanvig, \u201csome formulation of the Principle of Alternative\nPossibilities (PAP) correctly describes this notion of [libertarian]\nfreedom\u201d; and, as he also points out, this \u201cprinciple\nclaims that in order to act freely one must be able to do\notherwise\u201d (48). But at most PAP merely sets forth a necessary\ncondition of someone acting freely in the libertarian sense, and it\nincludes no requirement that a free choice be even minimally rational.\nSo consider again the example, introduced in section 2.1 above, of a\nschizophrenic young man who kills his loving mother, believing her to\nbe a sinister space alien who has devoured his real mother; and this\ntime suppose further that he does so in a context in which PAP obtains\nand he categorically could have chosen otherwise (perhaps because he\nworries about possible retaliation from other sinister space aliens).\nWhy suppose that such an irrational choice and action, even if not\ncausally determined, would qualify as an instance of acting freely?\nEither our seriously deluded beliefs, particularly those with\ndestructive consequences in our own lives, are in principle\ncorrectable by some degree of powerful evidence against them, or the\nchoices that rest upon them are simply too irrational to qualify as\nfree moral choices.\n\nIf that is true, then not just any causally undetermined choice, or\njust any agent caused choice, or just any randomly generated selection\nbetween alternatives will qualify as a free choice for which the\nchoosing agent is morally responsible. Moral freedom also requires a\nminimal degree of rationality on the part of the choosing agent,\nincluding an ability to learn from experience, an ability to discern\nnormal reasons for acting, and a capacity for moral improvement. With\ngood reason, therefore, do we exclude lower animals, small children,\nthe severely brain damaged, and perhaps even paranoid schizophrenics\nfrom the class of free moral agents. For, however causally\nundetermined some of their behaviors might be, they all lack some part\nof the rationality required to qualify as free moral\n agents.[9]\n\n\nNow consider again the view of C. S. Lewis and many other Christians\nconcerning the bliss that union with the divine nature entails, so\nthey believe. and the objective horror that separation from it\nentails, and suppose that the outer darkness\u2014that is, a soul\nsuspended alone in nothingness, without even a physical order to\nexperience and without any human relationships at all\u2014should be\nthe logical limit (short of annihilation) of possible separation from\nthe divine nature. These ideas seem to lead naturally to a dilemma\nargument for the conclusion that a freely chosen eternal destiny apart\nfrom God is metaphysically impossible. For either a person S is fully\ninformed about who God is and what both union with the divine nature\nand separation from it would entail, or S is not so informed. If S\nis fully informed and should choose a life apart from God\nanyway, then S\u2019s choice would be utterly and almost\ninconceivably irrational; such a choice would fall well below the\nthreshold required for moral freedom. And if S is not fully informed,\nthen God can of course continue to work with S, subjecting S to new\nexperiences, shattering S\u2019s illusions, and correcting S\u2019s\nmisjudgments in perfectly natural ways that do not interfere with\nS\u2019s freedom. Beyond that, for as long as S remains less than\nfully informed, S is simply in no position to reject the true God; S\nmay reject a caricature of God, perhaps even a caricature of S\u2019s\nown devising, but S is in no position to reject the true God.\nTherefore, in either case, whether S is fully informed or less than\nfully informed, it is simply not possible that S should reject the\ntrue God freely. \n\nBy way of a reply to this argument and in defense of his own\nfree\u2013will approach to hell\u2014which, by the way, in no way\nexcludes the possibility that some inhabitants of hell may\neventually escape from it\u2014Jerry Walls concedes that \u201cthe\nchoice of evil is impossible for anyone who has a fully formed\nawareness that God is the source of happiness and sin the cause of\nmisery\u201d (Walls 1992, 133). But Walls also contends that, even if\nthose in hell have rejected a caricature of God rather than the true\nGod, it remains possible that some of them will finally make a\ndecisive choice of evil and will thus remain in hell forever.\nHe then makes a three-fold claim: first, that the damned have in some\nsense deluded themselves, second, that they have the power to cling to\ntheir delusions forever, and third, that God cannot forcibly remove\ntheir self-imposed deceptions without interfering with their\nfreedom in relation to God (Walls 1992, Ch. 5).\n\nFor more detailed discussions of these and related issues, see\nSwinburne 1989 (Ch. 12), Craig 1989 and 1993, Talbott 2007, Walls 1992\n(Ch. 5), 2004a, and 2004b, Kronen and Reitan 2011 (142\u2013146), and\nManis 2016 and 2019. See also sections 4.2 and 5.1 below.\n3.2 Moral Freedom and Irreparable Harm\n\nConsider now the two conditions under which we humans typically feel\njustified in interfering with the freedom of others (see Talbott\n1990a, 38). We feel justified, on the one hand, in preventing one\nperson from doing irreparable harm\u2014or more accurately, harm that\nno human being can repair\u2014to another; a loving father\nmay thus report his own son to the police in an effort to prevent the\nson from committing murder. We also feel justified, on the other hand,\nin preventing our loved ones from doing irreparable harm to\nthemselves; a loving father may thus physically overpower his daughter\nin an effort to prevent her from committing suicide.\n\nNow one might, it is true, draw a number of faulty inferences from\nsuch examples as these, in part because we humans tend to think of\nirreparable harm within the context of a very limited timeframe, a\nperson\u2019s life on earth. Harm that no human being can repair may\nnonetheless be harm that God can repair. It does not follow,\ntherefore, that a loving and omnipotent God, whose goal is the\nreconciliation of the world, would prevent every suicide and every\nmurder; it follows only that such a God would prevent every harm that\nnot even omnipotence could repair at some future time, and neither\nsuicide nor murder is necessarily an instance of that kind of\nharm. So even though a loving God might sometimes permit murder, such\na God would never permit one person to annihilate the soul of another\nor to destroy the very possibility of future happiness in another; and\neven though a loving God might sometimes permit suicide, such a God\nwould never permit genuine loved ones to destroy the very possibility\nof future happiness in themselves either. The latter conclusion\nconcerning suicide is no doubt the more controversial, and Jonathan\nKvanvig in particular has challenged it (see Kvanvig 1993,\n83\u201388). But whatever the resolution of this particular debate,\nperhaps both parties can agree that God, as Creator, would deal with a\nmuch larger picture and a much longer timeframe than that with which\nwe humans are immediately concerned.\n\nSo the idea of irreparable harm\u2014that is, of harm that\nnot even omnipotence could ever repair\u2014is critical at this\npoint. It is most relevant, perhaps, in cases where someone imagines\nsinners freely choosing annihilation (Kvanvig), or imagines them\nfreely making a decisive and irreversible choice of evil (Walls), or\nimagines them freely locking the gates of hell from the inside (C. S.\nLewis). But proponents of the so-called escapism understanding of hell\ncan plausibly counter that hell is not necessarily an instance of such\nirreparable harm, and Raymond VanArragon in particular raises the\npossibility that God might permit some loved ones to continue forever\nrejecting God in a non-decisive way that would not, at any given time,\nharm them irreparably (see VanArragon 2010, 37ff; see also Kvanvig\n2011, 52). Here it is perhaps worth noting how broadly VanArragon\ndefines the term \u201crejecting God\u201d (see 2010,\n30\u201331)\u2014so broadly, in fact, that any sin for which one is\nmorally responsible would count as an instance of someone rejecting\nGod. He thus explicitly states that rejecting God in his broad sense\nrequires neither an awareness of God nor a conscious decision, however\nconfused it may be, to embrace a life apart from God. Accordingly,\npersistent sinning without end would never result, given such an\naccount, in anything like the traditional hell, whether the latter be\nunderstood as a lake of fire, the outer darkness, or any other\ncondition that would reveal the full horror of separation from God\n(given the traditional Christian understanding of such separation).\nNeither would such a sinner ever achieve a state of full clarity. For\ngiven VanArragon\u2019s understanding of libertarian freedom,\ncontinuing to sin forever would require a perpetual context of\nambiguity, ignorance, and misperception. \n4. The Universalist Rejection of Everlasting Separation\n\nA theist of any religion who accepts the traditional idea of\neverlasting punishment, or even the idea of an everlasting separation\nfrom God, must either reject the idea that that all human sinners are\nequal objects of God\u2019s redemptive love (see proposition (1) in\nsection 1 above) or reject the idea that God\u2019s redemptive love\nwill triumph in the end and bring reconciliation to each and every\nobject of such divine love (see proposition (2)). But a theist who\naccepts proposition (1), as the Arminians do, and also accepts\nproposition (2), as the Augustinians do, can then reason deductively\nthat almighty God will indeed triumph in the end and successfully win\nover each and every human sinner. From the perspective of an\ninterpretation of the Christian Bible, moreover, Christian\nuniversalists need only accept the exegetical arguments of the\nArminian theologians in support of (1) and the exegetical arguments of\nthe Augustinian theologians in support of (2); that alone would enable\nthem to build an exegetical case for a universalist interpretation of\nthe Bible as a whole.\n4.1 Divine Grace and the Inclusive Nature of Love\n\nOne argument in support of proposition (1) contends that love\n(especially in the form of willing the very best for another) is\ninclusive in this sense: even where it is logically possible for a\nloving relationship to come to an end, two persons are bound together\nin love only when their purposes and interests, even the conditions of\ntheir happiness, are so logically intertwined as to be inseparable. If\na mother should love her child even as she loves herself, for example,\nthen any evil that befalls the child is likewise an evil that befalls\nthe mother and any good that befalls the child is likewise a good that\nbefalls the mother; hence, it is simply not possible, according to\nthis argument, for God to will the best for the mother without also\nwilling the best for the child as well.\n\nFor similar reasons, Kenneth Einar Himma has argued that some\nwidespread moral intuitions, \u201ctogether with Christian\nexclusivism and the traditional doctrine of hell, entail that it is\nmorally wrong for anyone to have children\u201d (Himma 2011, 198).\nThat argument seems especially forceful in the context of Augustinian\ntheology, which implies that, for all any set of potential parents\nknow, any child they might produce could be one of the reprobate whom\nGod has hated from the beginning and has destined from the beginning\nfor eternal torment in hell. The title of Himma\u2019s article,\n\u201cBirth as a Grave Misfortune,\u201d would seem to describe such\ncases perfectly. (See Bawulski 2013 for a reply to Himma and Himma\n2016 for Himma\u2019s rejoinder.)\n\nIn any event, Arminians and universalists both regard an acceptance of\nproposition (1) as essential to a proper understanding of divine\ngrace. Could God truly extend grace to an elect mother, they might\nask, by making the baby she loves with all her heart the object of a\ndivine hatred and do this, as the Augustinians say was done in the\ncase of Esau, even before the child was born or had done anything good\nor bad? As the Arminians and the universalists both view the matter,\nthe Augustinians have embraced a logical impossibility: the idea that\nGod could extend a genuine love and compassion to one person even as\nGod withholds it from some of that person\u2019s own loved ones. They\ntherefore reject the doctrine of limited election on the ground that\nit undermines the concept of grace altogether. Where they disagree, of\ncourse, is over the issue of whether the objects of God\u2019s love\ncan resist his grace forever. Whereas Arminians hold that, given the\nreality of free will, we humans can, if we so choose, resist\nGod\u2019s grace forever, universalists tend to believe that, even\nthough we can resist God\u2019s grace for a while, perhaps even for a\nsubstantial period of time (while mired in ignorance and ambiguity),\nwe cannot resist it forever. So the issue between these two camps, the\nArminians and the universalists, finally comes down to the question of\nwhich position has the resources for a better account of human freedom\nand of God\u2019s respect for it (see, for example, the exchange\nbetween Walls 2004 and Talbott 2004). Or, to put the question in a\nslightly different way, which position, if either, requires that God\ninterfere with human freedom (or human autonomy) in morally\ninappropriate ways? As the following section should illustrate, the\nanswer to this question may be far more complicated than some might at\nfirst imagine.\n4.2 Universalism and Human Freedom\n\nA widely held assumption among free\u2013will theists is that no\nguarantee of universal reconciliation is even possible apart from\nGod\u2019s willingness to interfere with human freedom in those cases\nwhere someone persists in rejecting God and his grace. Indeed,\nJonathan Kvanvig goes so far as to describe universalism as a\n\u201cview, according to which God finally decides that if one has\nnot freely chosen Heaven, there will come a time when one will be\nbrought to Heaven against one\u2019s will. One will experience, in\nthis sense, coercive redemption at some point\u201d (Kvanvig 2011,\n14). But in fact, no universalist\u2014not even a theological\ndeterminist\u2014holds that God sometimes coerces people into heaven\nagainst their will. For although many Christian universalists\nbelieve that God provided Saul of Tarsus with certain revelatory\nexperiences that changed his mind in the end and therefore\nchanged his will as well, this is a far cry from claiming that he was\ncoerced against his will. Kvanvig\u2019s own understanding of\nlibertarian freedom, moreover, already establishes the logical\npossibility that God can bring about a universal reconciliation\nwithout in any way interfering with human freedom. \n\nBut in addition to defending the bare logical possibility of such a\nuniversal reconciliation on libertarian grounds, Eric Reitan has set\nforth an intriguing argument, which he calls \u201cthe Argument from\nInfinite Opportunity,\u201d for the conclusion that God can\neffectively guarantee the salvation of all sinners without ever\ninterfering with anyone\u2019s libertarian freedom (see Kronen and\nReitan 2011, Ch. 8). The basic idea here is that a sinner could have,\nif necessary, infinitely many opportunities over an unending stretch\nof time to repent and to submit to God freely. So consider this.\nAlthough it is logically possible, given the normal philosophical view\nof the matter, that a fair coin would never land heads up, not even\nonce in a trillion tosses, such an eventuality is so incredibly\nimprobable and so close to an impossibility that no one need fear it\nactually happening. Similarly, in working with some sinner S\n(shattering S\u2019s illusions and correcting S\u2019s ignorance),\nGod could presumably bring S to a point, just short of actually\ndetermining S\u2019s choice, where S would see the choice between\nhorror and bliss with such clarity that the probability of S repenting\nand submitting to God would be extremely high. Or, if you prefer, drop\nthe probability to .5. Over an indefinitely long period of time, S\nwould still have an indefinitely large number of opportunities to\nrepent; and so, according to Reitan, the assumption that sinners\nretain their libertarian freedom together with the Christian doctrine\nof the preservation of the saints yields the following result. We can\nbe just as confident that God will eventually win over all sinners\n(and do so without causally determining their choices), as we can be\nthat a fair coin will land heads up at least once in a trillion\ntosses.\n\nA possible reply to Reitan\u2019s argument, as just briefly\nsummarized, is that our free choices can sometimes create a hardened\ncharacter, which in turn places constraints on future free choices.\nBut either the hardened character of those in hell removes forever the\npsychological possibility of their choosing to repent, or it does not.\nIf it does remove that psychological possibility, then they do not\ncontinue rejecting God freely in the sense that the Principle of\nAlternative Possibilities (PAP) requires; and if it does not remove\nthat psychological possibility, then Reitan\u2019s argument remains\npertinent. Beyond that, the most critical issue at this point concerns\nthe relationship between free choice, on the one hand, and character\nformation, on the other. Our moral experience does seem to provide\nevidence that a pattern of bad choices can sometimes produce bad\nhabits and a bad moral character, but it also seems to provide\nevidence that a pattern of bad choices can sometimes bring one closer\nto a dramatic conversion of some kind. So why not suppose that a\npattern of bad choices might be even more useful to God than a pattern\nof good choices would be in teaching the hard lessons we sometimes\nneed to learn and in thus rendering a dramatic conversion increasingly\nmore probable over the long run? Are not the destructive consequences\nthat alcoholism can have in the lives of some people the very thing\nthat sometimes motivates them to seek help and even to give up alcohol\n altogether?[10]\n For more on the issue of free will and character formation, see\nSwinburne 1989 (Ch. 12), Sennett 1999, Murray 1999, the rejoinder to\nMurray in Kronen and Reitan 2011 (170\u2013177), the discussion of\ncharacter formation in Talbott 2010 (9\u201313), and section 5.1\nbelow.\n4.3 The Limits of God\u2019s Power to Preserve Human Freedom\n\nSuppose that a man is standing atop the Empire State Building with the\nintent of committing suicide by jumping off and plunging to his death\nbelow. One obvious way in which God could interfere with the\nman\u2019s freedom in this matter would be simply to cause him to\nchange his mind; that would effectively prevent the suicide from\noccurring. But there is another, less obvious, way in which God could\ninterfere with the man\u2019s freedom to commit suicide; God could\npermit him to leap from the building and then cause him to float\ngently to the ground like a feather; that too would effectively\nprevent the suicide from occurring. So one is not free to accomplish\nsome action or to achieve some end, unless God permits one to\nexperience the chosen end, however confusedly one may have chosen it;\nand neither is one free to separate oneself from God, or from the\nultimate source of human happiness as Christians understand it, unless\nGod permits one to experience the very life one has chosen and the\nfull measure of misery that it entails.\n\nGiven the almost universal Christian assumption that a complete\nseparation from the divine nature (in the outer darkness, for example)\nwould be an objective horror, it seems to follow that even God would\nface a dilemma with respect to human freedom. For either God could\npermit sinners to follow a path that ultimately leads, according to\nChristian theology, to an objective horror and permit them to continue\nfollowing it for as long as they freely choose to do so, or God could\nat some point prevent them from continuing along their freely chosen\npath. If God should permit sinners to continue along their freely\nchosen path\u2014the one that unbeknownst to them will inevitably\nlead them to an objective horror\u2014then their own experience,\nprovided they are rational enough to qualify as free moral agents,\nwould eventually shatter their illusions and remove their\nlibertarian freedom to continue along that path.\nAlternatively, if God should prevent sinners from achieving their\nfreely chosen goal of separating themselves from the divine nature,\nthen they would have no real freedom to do so. In neither case,\ntherefore, would sinners be able to retain forever their libertarian\nfreedom to continue separating themselves from the divine nature and\nfrom the ultimate source of human happiness. \n\nIf this argument should be sound, it also seems to follow that, no\nmatter how tenaciously some sinners might pursue a life apart from God\nand resist the divine purpose for their lives, God would have, as a\nsort of last resort, a sure-fire way to shatter the illusions that\nmake their rebellion possible in the first place. To do so, God need\nonly honor their own free choices and permit them to experience the\nvery life they have confusedly chosen for themselves. Why interfere\nwith someone\u2019s freedom, after all, at the very point where\nhonoring that freedom would in fact teach a hard lesson and therefore\ndo the most good? Would that not be utterly incompatible with\nGod\u2019s moral character, as most Christians understand it? \n\nHowever one might answer such a question, the Christian\nuniversalist\u2019s understanding of the nature and scope of\nGod\u2019s irresistible grace is very different from the Augustinian\nunderstanding of it. For Christian universalists not only reject the\nAugustinian idea that God\u2019s irresistible grace extends to a\nlimited elect only; they also hold that God\u2019s judgment of sin is\nessentially a matter of permitting sinners to experience the very\ncondition of separation they have confusedly chosen for themselves.\nMany Christian universalists are thus fond of quoting St. Paul\u2019s\nremark that \u201cGod has bound everyone over to disobedience so that\nhe may have mercy on them all\u201d (Rom. 11:32\u2014NIV), and they\ninterpret this as a declaration that divine judgment, however harsh it\nmay seem, is itself an expression of divine mercy and is therefore\npart of what makes God\u2019s grace irresistible in the end. If, as a\nlast resort, God should allow a sinner to live for a while without\neven an implicit experience of the divine\n nature,[11]\n the resulting horror, they believe, will at last shatter any illusion\nthat some good is achievable apart from God; and such a discovery will\nfinally elicit a cry for help of a kind that, however faint it may be,\nis just what God needs in order to begin and eventually to complete\nthe process of reconciliation. \n\nIn sum, opponents of universalism must either restrict God\u2019s\nredemptive love to a limited elect or admit that God\u2019s love will\nsuffer an ultimate defeat in this sense: God\u2019s own desire for\nthe human race as a whole, as expressed in a place like 1 Timothy 2:4,\nwill never be satisfied. Because the Arminians and the universalists\nagree that God could never love an elect mother even as, at the same\ntime, God rejects her beloved baby, they both agree that the first\nalternative is utterly impossible. But because the issues surrounding\nthe idea of free will are so complex and remain the source of so much\nphilosophical controversy, perhaps they can also agree that a\nfree\u2013will theodicy of hell is the best philosophical account\ncurrently available for a doctrine of everlasting separation from God.\n\n5. Heaven: Three Critical Issues\n\nRarely, if ever, are Christian theologians very specific about what\nheaven will supposedly be like, and there are no doubt good reasons\nfor this. For most of them would deny that the primary sources of the\nChristian faith, such as the Bible, provide much information on this\nparticular matter. But three issues have typically arisen in the\nrelevant philosophical literature: first, because so many of the\nrecent Christian philosophers have focused upon free will theodicies\nof hell, it is hardly surprising that the issue of freedom in heaven\nshould likewise have arisen; a second issue is whether the misery of\nloved ones in hell would undermine the blessedness of those in heaven;\nand a third issue is whether immortality of any kind would ultimately\nlead to tedium, boredom, and an insipid life.\n5.1 Freedom in Heaven\n\nLike the arguments over universalism and human freedom, as briefly\nsummarized in section 4.2 above, the issue of freedom in heaven once\nagain illustrates the need for a reasonably clear and complete account\nof free will. It also illustrates how easily a purely verbal dispute,\nwhich is an apparent dispute that arises from different uses of the\nsame term, can sometimes disguise itself as a genuine disagreement\nover some matter of substance. With respect to the issue of freedom in\nheaven, here are a couple of additional examples to consider: (a) the\nhonest banker whose deeply-rooted moral and religious convictions make\nit psychologically impossible for him to accept a bribe in a given\nsituation, and (b) the mother whose great love for her newborn baby\nmakes it psychologically impossible for her knowingly to harm her\nbeloved child physically. The question of whether there is freedom in\nheaven seems relevantly similar to the question of whether our honest\nbanker freely refuses the bribe and whether our loving mother\nfreely refuses to do anything she knows would harm her baby\nphysically. \n\nConsider now three different non-compatibilist accounts of what it\nmeans to act freely and the implications that each of these\naccounts has for the possibility of freedom in heaven. According to\nthe first account, briefly introduced in section 3.1 above, freedom\nalways requires that PAP obtain; that is, one is free with respect to\nsome action A in a given set of circumstances only if it is within\none\u2019s power to do A in that set of circumstances and also within\none\u2019s power to refrain from doing A. So if no one in heaven, as\nChristians typically understand it, will ever have the slightest\ninclination to disobey God\u2014if, that is, it would be as\npsychologically impossible for the saints in heaven to disobey God as\nit would be for our loving mother to torture her beloved baby to\ndeath, then there can be no freedom of that kind in heaven.\nThis is not a matter for dispute; it is instead merely a matter of\nbeing clear about a specified use of the term \u201cfreedom.\u201d\nEither the saints in heaven retain a robust power to disobey God and\nto sin, or they do not have the kind of freedom that PAP specifies.\nOr, to put it another way: if the saints in heaven do have this kind\nof freedom even as Lucifer, according to one traditional\ninterpretation of his supposed fall from perfection, was able to\ncommit the primal sin in heaven, then they also retain the power to\nsin in heaven (see Matheson 2018, 66). \n\nA second account carries no implication that having the relevant\nfreedom in the present always requires an ability to do otherwise\nin the present, though it does require an ability to do\notherwise at various times in one\u2019s life history. For according\nto Robert Kane, \u201cAgents with free will . . . must be such that\nthey could have done otherwise on some occasions of their life\nhistories with respect to some character- or motive-forming acts by\nwhich they make themselves into the kinds of persons they are\u201d\n(Kane 1998, 72). In a similar vein, James F. Sennett defends the free\nwill of the saints in heaven by in effect arguing that they have\nfreely chosen their own moral character. \u201cA character that is\nlibertarian freely chosen,\u201d he therefore suggests, \u201cis the\nonly kind of character that can determine compatibilist free\nchoices\u201d (Sennett 1999, 74; and for a similar view, albeit\ntweaked a bit, see Pawl and Timpe 2008). The basic idea here seems to\nbe that one\u2019s own motives and character can determine a free\naction in the present only when one is fully responsible for the\nmotives and character traits that determine this action. \n\nA possible difficulty here is to provide a coherent account, not to\nmention an empirically verifiable account, of how certain undetermined\nchoices buried in a life history might render one responsible for\none\u2019s present motives and character traits. This is a problem in\npart because, as Manuel Vargas points out, \u201ceven freely chosen\nfeatures of our lives and ourselves can, because of our epistemic\nlimitations, yield unanticipated consequences\u201d (Vargas 2005,\n282)\u2014as, for instance, when someone sincerely cultivates moral\nintegrity and inadvertently produces some of the worst character\ntraits: moral rigidity, self-righteousness, and a lack of compassion.\nSimilarly, someone\u2019s worst choices and the lessons learned from\nthem may be the very thing that has the most profound effect on the\ndevelopment of a good character. So given our epistemic limitations\nand the unanticipated consequences of our free choices, is it any\nwonder that many Christian theologians view a good character as a gift\nfrom God rather than as something for which we can credit ourselves?\n\n\nA third account of freedom, sometimes neglected by those who emphasize\nthe importance of human freedom, is Susan Wolf\u2019s Reason View,\naccording to which \u201cthe freedom necessary for responsibility\nconsists in the ability (or freedom) to do the right thing for the\nright reasons\u201d (Wolf 1990, 94). But unlike the autonomy view, as\nshe calls it, such freedom does not require the ability to refrain\nfrom doing the right thing for the right reasons. Wolf thus commits\nherself to the following asymmetry: whereas committing a wrong (or\nimmoral) act freely requires an ability to do otherwise and\ntherefore to refrain from acting wrongly, doing the right thing for\nthe right reasons freely does not require an ability to act\notherwise. Such a view takes full advantage of the idea, expressed in\nsection 3.1 above, that the relevant freedom requires a minimal degree\nof rationality, and it might be modified slightly as follows. If a\nrelevant threshold of rationality requires only an ability to make\nreasonable judgments, rather than infallible ones, concerning the best\ncourse of action, then perhaps we can say that freedom consists in the\nability to follow one\u2019s own reasonable judgment concerning the\nbest course of action in a given situation (see Talbott 2009, 388).\nWhether one accepts such a modification or not, something like\nWolf\u2019s Reason View seems to accord perfectly with the religious\nview that those in heaven are the freest of all created persons, even\nas those in hell remain in bondage to sin (a bondage similar to an\nalcoholic\u2019s bondage to alcohol). Such a view also seems to\naccord perfectly with St. Paul\u2019s view that salvation is a means\nby which the will is released from its bondage to sin. \n5.2 Concerning the Misery of Loved Ones in Hell\n\nAssuming that love ties people\u2019s interests together in the way\ndescribed in section 4.1 above, one might then wonder how God could\npreserve the happiness of those in heaven who know that some of their\nown loved ones are suffering forever in hell. For the question\ninevitably arises, \u201cHow could anyone remain happy knowing that a\ngenuine loved one, however corrupted, is destined to be miserable\nforever\u201d. When a reporter asked the mother of Ted\nBundy, a serial murderer of young women, whether she could still\nsupport a son who had become a monster, her answer provided a poignant\nillustration of the problem. \u201cOf course I support him,\u201d\nshe declared, as her eyes filled with tears and her body literally\nbegan shaking. \u201cHe is my son. I love him. I have to support\nhim.\u201d She obviously did not support his monstrous crimes, and\nneither did she even object to the severity of his punishment. But\nstill, one wonders how this suffering woman\u2014a committed\nChristian, by the way\u2014could ever achieve supreme happiness\nknowing that the son she continued to love was destined to be lost\nforever without any future hope of redemption.\n\nSuch considerations have led some, including the 19th\nCentury theologian Friedrich Schleiermacher, to argue that the misery\nof those in hell would undermine altogether the blessedness of the\nredeemed in heaven (see Schleiermacher 1830, 721\u2013722; Kronen and\nReitan 2011, 80\u201389; and Talbott 1990b, 237\u2013241). But\nothers have argued that God could always shield forever the redeemed\nin heaven from painful memories of the lost in hell. William Lane\nCraig thus raises the possibility that God could simply\n\u201cobliterate\u201d from the minds of the redeemed \u201cany\nknowledge of lost persons so that they experience no pangs of remorse\nfor them\u201d (Craig, 1991, 306). Given the widespread theological\nview, which Craig seems to accept, that billions of people will\neventually be lost forever, one issue here concerns how much of some\npeople\u2019s minds, particularly those whose entire family is lost\nforever, God would have to wipe out in order to accomplish such a\nstrategy. Another concerns how God, as an infinitely loving being,\nmight expunge the infinitely more painful memories from his own mind.\nBut the main issue to be resolved here is whether blissful\nignorance qualifies as a worthwhile form of happiness at all.\n\nAs a matter of historical fact, in any case, some of the most\ninfluential theologians in the Western tradition, including some who\nare widely admired as heroes of faith, have not only made an eternal\ntorture chamber an important part of their teaching about hell; they\nseem also to have gloried in the idea that the torments of those\nwrithing in hell forever will increase the joy of those in heaven.\nJonathan Edwards thus wrote: \u201cWhen the saints in glory \u2026\nshall see how miserable others of their fellow-creatures are, who were\nnaturally in the same circumstances with themselves; when they shall\nsee the smoke of their torment, and the raging of the flames of their\nburning, and hear their dolorous shrieks and cries, and consider that\nthey [the saints] in the mean time are in the most blissful state and\nshall surely be in it to all eternity; how will they rejoice!\u201d\n(Edwards 1834, sec. II\n [available online]).\n Remarkably, Edwards was also a theological determinist who held that\nGod determined from the beginning to bring a huge number of people to\na horrific end and did so for the precise purpose of increasing the\njoy of the elect in heaven. He even insisted, contra Craig,\nthat the inhabitants of heaven and hell will be acutely aware of each\nother\u2019s condition; so even as the torments of former loved ones\nin hell will contribute to the joy of those in heaven, so the joy of\nformer loved ones in heaven will contribute to the psychological\ntorment of those in hell. He thus made the following kind of warning\nan important part of his preaching: \u201cHow will you bear to see\nyour parents, who in this life had so dear an affection for you, now\nwithout any love to you \u2026 How will you bear to see and hear\nthem praising the Judge, for his justice exercised in pronouncing this\nsentence, and hearing it with holy joy in their countenances, and\nshouting forth the praises and hallelujahs of God and Christ on that\naccount?\u201d (sec. IV).\n\nAs horrifying as such descriptions are apt to appear to someone such\nas Ted Bundy\u2019s mother, perhaps all parties can agree on one\nthing at least. If justice were to require that one suffer\neternally for sins that God himself causally determined, then such\nsuffering would have to be a source of satisfaction, if not outright\nbliss, on the part of any fair-minded person witnessing it. But since,\nas they say, one person\u2019s modus ponens is another\u2019s modus\n tollens,[12]\n a critic of Edwards will simply reply in the following way. No\nfair-minded person would find satisfaction in someone\u2019s\nexperiencing eternal torment as punishment for even the worst of sins,\nparticularly in the case of sins that God himself has causally\ndetermined; therefore, such torment is not what justice requires.\nAccording to Edwards\u2019s own theology, moreover, he was no less\ndeserving of eternal torment himself than are those who suffer in\nhell. Schleiermacher and many others therefore find it hard to\nunderstand how those who receive special favor in this regard could be\nso deliriously happy in the knowledge that some of their own loved\nones do not receive a similar special\n favor.[13]\n\n5.3 Concerning the Supposed Tedium of Immortality\n\nA third issue concerning heaven that sometimes arises is whether\neverlasting bliss is even a possible state of affairs. Bernard\nWilliams has thus suggested \u201cthat immortality would be, where\nconceivable at all, intolerable\u201d (in Fischer 1993, 73).\nCommenting on a play by Karel Capek about a women who at age 42\nreceives immortality and by age 342 no longer wants to live, Williams\nwrote: \u201cHer trouble was, it seems, boredom: a boredom connected\nwith the fact that everything that could happen and make sense to one\nhuman being of 42 had already happened to her\u201d by age 342\n(82).\n\nSuch a statement is reminiscent of a quotation often attributed to\nCharles H. Duell, who became commissioner of the U.S. patent office in\n1898. According to legend, Duell declared that everything that can be\ninvented has already been invented; and even though this wonderful\nstory is probably apocryphal, it nonetheless illustrates in a humorous\nway the possible consequences of an impoverished imagination. It would\nhardly take even 30 years, depending upon the circumstances, for a\ngiven life to become dull and insipid. But the idea that a healthy\nperson could exhaust all the possibilities for adventure and\nmeaningful experience in a mere 300 years will strike many as simply\npreposterous. A mere 300 years is virtually nothing, it is true, when\ncompared to a life without end. So the real issue is whether it is\nlogically possible that an unending life (in which one retains\none\u2019s identity as the same person) should be filled with\nunending joy and ever increasing opportunities for novel and\nmeaningful experiences.\n\nAddressing this very issue, John Martin Fischer writes:\n\u201cRemember [the possibility] that certain \u2026 of one\u2019s\nfamily and friends also have the relevant sort of immortality. It\nseems to me that under such circumstances one could live an attractive\nlife characterized by a desirable mix of fulfilling\nactivities\u201d (Fischer 1993, 10\u2014his italics). Might not an\nunending life even increase the possibilities for such a\ndesirable mix? A favorite symphony not heard for a hundred years or so\nmight be experienced as utterly fresh and exciting. And even if we set\naside anything that might raise a controversy about personal identity,\nthe mere discovery of an unexpected means of traversing our\nextravagant universe, with its billions of galaxies and billions of\nstar systems within each of them, might open up\u2014for adventurous\nspirits anyway\u2014incredible possibilities for new and exciting\nexperiences. Nor should we ignore the further possibility of\nexperiencing infinitely many other realms and universes that are not\nspatially contiguous with our own. Pursuing Fischer\u2019s idea of a\ndesirable mix even further, a longer life could also increase the\nchances for the experience of boredom itself to fit into a larger\ncontext of meaningful experience. In caring for her baby, for example,\na mother typically performs many mundane tasks that might seem utterly\ntedious were it not for the joy of interacting with her baby and of\nwatching it grow and flourish. Similarly, St. Paul found even the\ntedium of prison to be tolerable, so he claimed, because he saw it as\npart of a larger story that he believed to be both true and glorious.\nSo why allow, many religious people would ask, an impoverished\nimagination to exclude the very possibility of an over-arching story\narc perpetually giving fresh meaning to our individual lives?\n\nStill, all of that having been said, Williams\u2019s view concerning\nthe inevitably tedious nature of an unending life is not that far\nremoved from the religious view that in our present unperfected\ncondition we are not yet fit for eternity and not yet capable of\nexperiencing the most worthwhile forms of happiness; indeed, given our\npresent condition, some would claim, we might even turn heaven itself\ninto a hellish experience. And if that be true, then the task of\nrendering someone fit for eternal joy may be far more complicated,\neven for an omnipotent being, than one might have imagined. As many\nreligions including Christianity teach, we must first learn to love\nproperly before we can experience enduring happiness, and this\nrequires that we also be purged of all selfish tendencies, all lust\nfor power over others, every temptation to benefit ourselves at the\nexpense of others, and anything else that might separate one person\nfrom another. Right here, of course, is where Williams would question\nwhether a suitably transformed person would be the same individual as\nthe unperfected person that existed previously. But none of our moral\nimperfections, a religious person might retort, can coherently be\nnumbered among our essential properties\u2014as if we could never\nprogress morally and never learn to become more loving persons. So\nhere, perhaps, is the sum of the matter from a religious perspective:\nthe more self-absorbed we become, the more tedious and dreary our\nlives inevitably become over time. But the more outwardly focused we\nbecome in loving relationships, the more joyful and meaningful our\nlives also become over time.\n\nIn any case, the controversies associated with Williams\u2019s\nunderstanding of immortality are also relevant to the problem of evil.\nFor the same considerations that lead some to wonder whether\nimmortality would eventually become dreadfully boring may also lead\nsome of the religious to consider favorably the following hypothesis.\nFor all we know, an environment such as the one we live in\u2014an\nenvironment in which one encounters real threats and dangers of a\ntemporary kind, where one person\u2019s temporary welfare may depend\nupon the choices of others and upon natural forces over which one has\nlimited or no control, where a quest for truth and genuine discoveries\nabout the glories of God\u2019s creation are possible, and where\nmoral failure would likely provide ample opportunities for repentance,\nforgiveness, and atonement\u2014for all we know, such an environment\nis an important part of the process whereby God renders us fit for\neternal joy. Although the problem of evil is the subject of another\nentry (see the entry on\n The Problem of Evil),\n the relevant point for the topic of heaven is just this: one need not\nthink of heaven (or the coming age, as the Gospel writers sometimes\nrefer to it) as a static ethereal realm in which there is nothing to\ndo. One might instead suppose that God will never stop creating\nadditional persons to love and additional realms for us to experience\nand that we will always have important roles to play, as Paul hinted\nin Ephesians 2:7, in this ongoing process of creation and\nrevelation.",
