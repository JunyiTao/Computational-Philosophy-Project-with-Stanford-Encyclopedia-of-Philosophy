Introduction\n\n\nIn classical Greek and Egyptian myth, chimeras are depicted as having\nparts with the morphological characteristics typical of different\nspecies. The chimera of Greek mythology, for example, has the head of\na lion, the body of a goat, and the tail of a serpent. Not all\nchimeras are mythical, however. In fact, each one of us is most likely\na chimera, according to the modern scientific definition of a chimera\nas a single organism composed of cells with different embryonic\norigins (Nagy and Rossant 2001). As we interact with other organisms\nover the years, their cells become incorporated into our bodies, not only\nthrough a process of consumption and digestion, but also through processes\nthat leave the cells intact. For example, pregnant women acquire cells\nfrom their fetuses and mosquitoes transfer blood between their\nsuccessive victims.  More exotic natural chimeras occur when\nearly-stage human embryos fuse in utero, resulting in a child with two\ndistinct genotypes.  Laboratory-created chimeras include the geep, an\nintraspecies chimera made by fusing a sheep embryo with a goat embryo\nor by transplanting cells from one embryo into another (Fehilly,\nWilladsen, and Tucker 1984; Polzin et al. 1987). Like the\nchimeras of myth, the geep exhibits morphological traits of multiple\nspecies, with wool on some parts of its body and hair on\nothers. Researchers have also created quail/chick chimeras by\ntransferring parts of the neural tube (the precursor of the central\nnervous system) from a quail embryo into a Leghorn embryo, resulting\nin the transfer of vocalizations typical of a quail into the Leghorn\nchick (Couly, Coltey, and Le Douarin 1992). Intraspecies mice/mice\nchimeras, the most common of the laboratory-created chimeras, are\ntypically created by genetically engineering embryonic stem cells\nderived from one mouse embryo and inserting them into another mouse\nembryo at the blastocyst stage. The modified embryos are then\nimplanted into surrogate mice and brought to term. If the gametes\n(sperm or eggs) of the resulting chimeric mice are descendants of the\ngenetically engineered cells, they can then be bred with each other to\nproduce nonchimeric offspring carrying the genetic alteration in all\nof their cells.\n\n\nThe early discussion of ethical issues raised by chimeras occurred\nunder the heading of xenotransplantation, the use of non-human animals\nas a source of cells, tissues, or organs for transplantation into\nhumans (Institute of Medicine 1996). The moral argument in favor of\nxenotransplantation was one of beneficence: the shortage of human\norgans available for transplant and the inadequacy of alternatives\nmeant that if non-human animals could serve as a source of organs,\nhundreds of thousands of human lives could be saved or improved each\nyear (ibid., 14). The main ethical problems included the\nhealth risks for the transplant recipient (e.g., a substantial risk of\nhyperacute rejection and graft-versus-host disease), traditional\nanimal ethics issues, concerns about informed consent (complicated by\nempirical uncertainties and the possibility of legally mandated\nlife-long health surveillance), fair allocation of health care\nresources, and the public health issue that xenotransplantation would\nallow viruses to jump the species barrier into humans.\n\n\nFor the purposes of this entry, however, the term\n\u201cchimera\u201d will be restricted to chimeras formed by the\nintroduction of human pluripotent stem cells (hPSCs) or their more\nspecialized derivatives into non-human animals.  Pluripotent cells are\ncapable of turning into any kind of tissue, and stem cells are capable\nof renewing themselves indefinitely. So hPSCs theoretically provide an\nindefinitely renewable source of any kind of human tissue, thus\noffering tremendous potential for basic research, drug development,\nand regenerative medicine (NIH 2001, 5\u201321). The first sources of hPSCs\nwere human embryos, and are thus referred to as human embryonic stem\ncells (hESCs). These were established by James Thomson and colleagues\nat the University of Wisconsin, Madison, in 1998 (Thomson et al. 1998)\nand their availability has expanded the range of human/non-human\nchimeras that scientists are capable of making. For example:\n\nThe gold standard for ascertaining whether non-human cells are\npluripotent involves injecting them into blastocyst-stage embryos. The\nresulting chimeras are then bred and the offspring examined to see if\nall of their cells are progeny of the inserted cells. If so, then the\ninserted cells were pluripotent, as evidenced by the fact that they\ncould give rise to germ cells and, consequently, to an entire\nindividual. In the case of hESCs, such a procedure would involve the\ncreation of human offspring as a means for testing cell potency, not\nan ethically viable procedure. Instead, the standard method for\nascertaining whether putative hESCs are truly pluripotent is to inject\nthem into postnatal, immune-deficient mice, and see whether they give\nrise to teratomas (tumors that consist of disorganized tissue growth\nof the three embryonic germ layers, endoderm, mesoderm, and\nectoderm).\nSu-Chun Zhang, a researcher at the University of Wisconsin,\nMadison, discovered how to direct undifferentiated hESCs into neural\nprecursors. To begin exploring whether these cells could serve as a\nsource of cells for possible nervous system repair, he transplanted\nthem into neonatal mice. The cells \u201cwere incorporated into a\nvariety of brain regions, where they differentiated into both neurons\nand astrocytes\u201d (Zhang et al. 2001, 1129).\nUndifferentiated hESCs have been transplanted into\nblastocyst-stage chick embryos to determine whether \u201cthe chick\nembryo could be used as an in vivo system for the study of human ES\ncell differentiation\u201d (Goldstein et al. 2002, 80).\nTransplants of hESCs into blastocyst-stage mouse embryos have been\nperformed to see if the chimeras could provide \u201can accessible\nplatform for studying the emergence of many human cell types; and with\nthe expansion of available hESCs to include genetically diseased\nlines, mouse/human chimeras may allow us to elucidate the bases of\ndisease by examining the behavior of such hESC lines in live animal\nmodels\u201d (James et al. 2006, 100).\nAs mentioned, xenotransplantation was traditionally conceived\nof transplanting animal organs into human beings. Such interspecies\ntransplants, though, impose even greater risks than\nallotransplantation (human-to-human transplants) on the organ\nrecipient because animal organs tend to induce a much more extreme\nimmune response than do human organs. Recent research attempts to\ngenetically engineer the animals to remove the most immunogenic\ncomponents. But some researchers are exploring the possibility of\ngoing further by genetically engineering the animal so that it cannot\nproduce the desired organ on its own. This creates an unoccupied niche\nin the animals. Human pluripotent stem cells are then inserted into\nthe animal to occupy that niche, with the result that the relevant\norgan is made entirely of human cells (Waltz 2017.)\n\n\n\nChimera research inherits the ethical issues associated with\ntraditional animal ethics and, when using hPSCs derived from embryos,\nwith hESC research in general, but one striking feature of the chimera\ndebate is the existence of several advisory bodies that exhibit a\ncautious reaction to certain kinds of chimeric research even though\nthey maintain that non-human animal research and embryo research are\ngenerally permissible. For example, the Human Embryo Research Panel of\nthe National Institutes of Health (NIH) issued a general endorsement\nof a wide range of embryo research (including hESC research) and\nresearch on non-human animals. Nonetheless, the panel expressed\nconcern about the \u201cextensive mixing\u201d that would occur in\nsome chimera research and unanimously opposed, \u201con ethical and\nscientific grounds, the creation of heterologous, or human-nonhuman\nchimeras, with or without transfer [into a uterus]\u201d (NIH 1994,\n80). Similar statements have been made by the Ethics Advisory Board of\nGeron, the private biotechnology company that financed Thomson\u2019s\noriginal derivations (Geron Ethics Advisory Board 1999, 34), the\nUniversity of Wisconsin\u2019s Biotechnology Advisory Committee, which\nprovided guidance to UW on hESC research policy (University of\nWisconsin Biotechnology Advisory Committee 2001), the Committee on\nGuidelines for Human Stem Cell Research created by the National\nAcademies\u2019 Institute of Medicine and the National Research Council\n(National Academy of Sciences 2005), and the International Society for\nStem Cell Research (International Society for Stem Cell Research 2006,\n7). This suggests that chimera research raises some ethical concerns\nthat are distinct from the traditional issues discussed about the use\nof non-human animals or human embryos in research.\n2. The Unnaturalness Argument\n\n\nThe argument against chimeras most often discussed is the\nUnnaturalness Argument. It is also the argument against chimeras most\noften rejected. Taken in its most basic form, the Unnaturalness\nArgument alleges that because the creation of chimeras is unnatural it\nis therefore wrong. The source of the alleged unnaturalness lies in the\nfact that creating chimeras involves violating the natural species\nboundaries between humans and non-humans.\n\n\nSome criticisms of the Unnaturalness Argument focus on the\ndifficulties of defining \u201cspecies.\u201d As Jason Robert and\nFran\u00e7oise Baylis (2003) note, although species can be defined\nin terms of reproductive isolation, genetic isolation, shared\nancestry, or homeostatic property clusters, none of these definitions\ntakes precedence over the others. Rather, \u201cBiologists typically\nmake do with a plurality of species concepts, invoking one or the\nother depending on the particular explanatory or investigative\ncontext\u201d (Robert and Baylis 2003, 3).\n\n\nDefinitional difficulties, though, do not in and of themselves\nprovide reasons for thinking that a concept is morally irrelevant.\nThere are, after all, intractable disagreements about how to delineate\nmany key concepts relevant to ethics, including: killing and letting\ndie, life and death, consciousness, rationality, equality, justice,\nrespect, rights, and goodness.\n\n\nOther criticisms focus on the permeability and fluidity of the alleged\n\u201cboundary\u201d between species. Over long spans of time,\nspecies undergo fusion and fission and although wide-crosses (breeding\nbetween individuals of different species) are rare, they can occur\nwithout human intervention. Moreover, bacteria and viruses frequently\ntransfer genes between organisms without any human intervention in a\nprocess called \u201chorizontal gene transfer.\u201d\n\n\nThis criticism is certainly probative against those who believe that\nthe boundary between species is morally relevant because they hold a\n\u201cbiblical or Aristotelian view of species as fixed and immutable\nrather than being slices of a dynamic, ever-changing process\u201d\n(Rollin 2003, 15), but the proponent of the Unnaturalness Argument\nneed not hold such a view. For example, the groups constituting one\u2019s\nfamily and one\u2019s fellow citizens change over time, and yet we owe\nspecial duties to our compatriots and to our kin in virtue of our\nspecial relationships to them. So, fixed boundaries are not necessary\nfor moral relevance. And the mere fact that bacteria naturally\ntransfer genes across species boundaries does not mean that the\nactivity is natural when it is performed by humans.\n\n\nA better objection to the Unnaturalness Argument challenges the\nalleged link between unnaturalness and wrongfulness. Indeed, if\ncrossing species boundaries is sufficient for unnaturalness, and if\nunnaturalness is sufficient for wrongfulness, then the creation of\nmules and all other cross-species hybrids, even hybrid lilies, would\nbe wrong. On those definitions of \u201cunnatural\u201d that make\nhuman intervention sufficient for unnaturalness, the view that\nunnaturalness is sufficient for wrongfulness would entail the even\nmore outlandish conclusion that everything humans do is wrong. If the\nUnnaturalness Argument is to be at all plausible, it must avoid such\nimplications.\n\n\nThe alleged link between unnaturalness and wrongness can be\nsupported in two ways, depending on whether the Unnaturalness Argument\nis intended to be a so-called intrinsic objection or an extrinsic\nobjection. An intrinsic objection alleges that an act is wrong because\nof its intrinsic properties, whereas an extrinsic objection alleges\nthat an act is wrong because of its consequences. A person who claims\nthat it is unethical to feed a certain diet to an animal because the\ndiet is unnatural is presumably making an extrinsic objection: because\nthe diet is unnatural, it will not meet the nutritional requirements of\nthe animal and therefore it will have unacceptable consequences for the\nanimal\u2019s health. A person who claims that the unnaturalness of\nbestiality makes it unethical, even when it does not cause any harm or\npain, is presumably making an intrinsic objection.\n\n\nIf the Unnaturalness Argument is intended to be an extrinsic\nobjection, the link between unnaturalness and wrongness will most\nlikely be supported by pointing to possible adverse consequences for\nthe environment, public health, or the animal subject itself. Adverse\nenvironmental consequences have not received much discussion, probably\nbecause they are presumed to be adequately managed through standard\nguidelines and regulations regarding the use of animals in laboratory\nresearch. The possibility of a public health crisis arising from a\ntransmissible infection crossing species boundaries, a significant\nconcern with xenotransplantation, is greatly reduced when the source\nof the biological material is human and the recipient a non-human\nanimal confined to a laboratory. (It should be noted, though, that\ntransmission of a porcine virus to human cells in a human/porcine\nchimera has already been demonstrated (Ogle et al. 2004).)\nAdverse consequences for the animal are important to address, but\ntheir implications will depend on the moral status of the animal, an\nissue addressed by the Borderline-Personhood Argument. On any of these\nbases of support, the proponent of an extrinsic unnaturalness argument\nwould not be committed to the conclusion that everything unnatural is\nunethical, since unnaturalness is not necessarily connected with these\nkinds of bad consequences, and even when it is connected with bad\nconsequences, the act may be justified on other grounds. \n\n\nThe Unnaturalness Argument is more commonly interpreted as being an\nintrinsic objection. Even as an intrinsic objection, though, it still\nmight take a direct or an indirect form. A person who thinks that\npromise-breaking is intrinsically wrong might think that\npromise-breaking itself is the wrong-making property, or they might\nbelieve that promise-breaking is intrinsically wrong because it is the\nbetraying of an induced expectation (Scanlon 1998; Pratt, 2001), which\nitself is the wrong-making property. On the latter view,\npromise-breaking is still intrinsically wrong because the betraying of\nan induced expectation is not a consequence of a prior and distinct act\nof breaking a promise; rather, in those circumstances, the breaking of\na promise is identical to the betraying of an induced expectation. The\nontological relationship between the two acts is not analogous to that\nbetween pulling the trigger and a person\u2019s death but rather to that\nbetween pulling the trigger and firing the gun. Similarly, those who\nbelieve that it is wrong to create chimeras because doing so is\nunnatural might claim that the intrinsic wrongness of these acts stems\ndirectly from their unnaturalness or they might think that the link\nbetween unnaturalness and wrongness is mediated by another property. As\nJohn Stuart Mill observed, concerns about unnaturalness are, for many,\nderived from concerns about offense to God:\n\n\n\nThe consciousness that whatever man does to improve his condition is\nin so much a censure and a thwarting of the spontaneous order of\nNature, has in all ages caused new and unprecedented attempts at\nimprovement to be generally at first under a shade of religious\nsuspicion; as being in any case uncomplimentary, and very probably\noffensive to the powerful beings (or, when polytheism gave place to\nmonotheism, to the all-powerful Being) supposed to govern the various\nphenomena of the universe, and of whose will the course of nature was\nconceived to be the expression. (Mill 1958 [1847], 14)\n\n\n\nThe content of God\u2019s will with regard to the manipulation of nature,\nthough, is subject to speculation on both sides. Gary Comstock, for\nexample, defends the use of recombinant DNA techniques against the\nobjection that it constitutes playing God:\n\n\n\nIf humans are made in the divine image, and if God desires that we\nexercise the spark of divinity within us, then it should be no surprise\nthat inquisitiveness in science is part of our nature. . .. It is\nunclear why the desire to investigate and manipulate the chemical bases\nof life should not be considered as much a manifestation of our\nGod-like nature as the writing of poetry and the playing of sonatas\nshould be. (Comstock 2000, 185)\n\n\n\nNo matter whether the proponent of an intrinsic unnaturalness argument\nbelieves that the link is direct or mediated, she will still not be\ncommitted to thinking that all unnatural acts are wrong. Even if the\nwrongness stems directly from the unnaturalness, this leaves open the\npossibility that something unnatural could be justified by\nsufficiently strong countervailing considerations, such as those\nprovided by medical benefit or scientific knowledge. The same holds if\nthe link is mediated, with the additional caveat that unnaturalness\nmay not be invariably correlated with the actual wrong-making\nproperty. As Mill noted, the proponent of the Unnaturalness Argument\nneed only object to attempts \u201cto exercise power over\nnature beyond a certain degree and a certain admitted\nrange\u201d (1958 [1847], 15, emphasis added). There is also the\npossibility that the moral relevance of properties, unnaturalness\nincluded, can vary from context to context (See Dancy 1993). In short,\nit could be true that creating chimeras is wrong because it is\nunnatural even though not everything unnatural is wrong.\n\n\nConceding that unnaturalness is not sufficient for wrongness, however,\nopens the proponent of the Unnaturalness Argument to a further\nchallenge, that of providing principled grounds for distinguishing\nbetween those cases in which an act is wrong because it is unnatural\nand those cases in which an act is unnatural but not wrong, and of\nshowing that creating chimeras falls into the former category. If the\nUnnaturalness Argument is intended as an extrinsic objection, there\nare several detailed frameworks available for addressing risks to\npublic health, the environment, or the non-human animal research\nsubject. Any extrinsic Unnaturalness Argument is free to apply those\nframeworks to chimeras, but will be incomplete until it actually does\nso. If the Unnaturalness Argument is intended as an intrinsic\nobjection, then Paul Thompson\u2019s observation regarding intrinsic\nobjections to the use of recombinant DNA techniques states the problem\nsuccinctly: \u201cno one has succeeded in articulating a principled way of\nstating why the unnaturalness associated with the manipulation of DNA\nis unethical, while ordinary plant and animal breeding, computers and\nmodern transport are not\u201d (Thompson 2000, 9).\n\n\nAt this stage in the dialectic, the Unnaturalness Argument can be\nsupplemented by considerations of the \u201cyuck factor.\u201d\nProponents of the yuck factor argue that the reaction some people\nexperience in contemplating certain acts sometimes suffices for\nknowing that the act is wrong, even in the absence of satisfactory\njustification for the reaction (Kass 1998, 687). So proponents of an\nintrinsic unnaturalness argument can insist that in spite of not being\nable to provide principled grounds for distinguishing between the two\nkinds of cases, they still know that creating chimeras is\nwrong. Again, this conclusion is potentially supported by the\nliterature on moral particularism, which allows that a property\u2019s\nmoral relevance can vary not only from context to context, but also in\na way not capturable by a general theory (Dancy 1993).\n\n\nSome have argued that the yuck factor has been discredited because it\nhas been used to rationalize discrimination (Thompson 2000). Racists\nclaimed to \u201cknow simply by looking\u201d that interracial\nmarriages were wrong. But the fact that an argument has been used\ninappropriately in some areas does not mean that it is inappropriate\nin other areas.  Paternalistic arguments were used to rationalize\nunjust treatment of women and racial minorities, but that does not mean\nthat they are inappropriate when applied to toddlers.\n\n\nEven opponents of the yuck factor must concede that, sometimes, we\nknow that an action is wrong merely on the basis of our reaction to it,\neven if we cannot satisfactorily justify that reaction. We know it is\nwrong to kill a healthy person so that his organs can be transplanted\nto save five lives, even though we presently lack any theoretically\nsatisfactory way of distinguishing that case from the various trolley\ncases prominent in the killing/letting-die literature. (See Kamm (2006)\nfor recent discussion.)\n\n\nSo appealing to the yuck factor can insulate an intrinsic\nUnnaturalness Argument from the most common objections. It does so,\nhowever, at significant cost. By conceding that unnaturalness is not\nsufficient for wrongfulness while failing to provide any positive\nargument for thinking that unnaturalness in the particular case of\nchimeras makes them wrong, the proponent of an intrinsic Unnaturalness\nArgument is reduced to the bald assertion that chimeras are wrong\nbecause they are unnatural. This fails to provide any reasons\nwhatsoever to those who do not already share that view. The many\npeople, then, who think that the unnaturalness of a chimera does not\nmake it unethical to create them are in no way epistemically\nirresponsible in simply rejecting the argument out of hand. Moreover,\nthe intrinsic Unnaturalness Argument differs from the killing/letting\ndie example given above in a significant way: although it is true that\nwe presently lack any theoretically satisfactory way of distinguishing\nbetween the organ transplantation case and the various trolley cases,\nwe can nonetheless go a long way towards explaining why it is wrong to\nkill a healthy person so that their organs can be transplanted. We can\ntalk about the harm of death, the frustration of future interests, the\nloss of valuable opportunities, the right not to be killed, and so on.\nBut why think that the mere fact that an activity is unnatural makes\nit intrinsically wrong, or even provides any reason whatsoever for\nthinking so? It is hard to even begin to make the case, at least in\nsecular terms. Although some maintain that certain patterns of\ninference from an \u201cis\u201d to an \u201cought\u201d are valid\n(see Thomson 1990, 1\u201333, for discussion), inferring that\nsomething is even prima facie intrinsically wrong from the particular\nfact that it is not natural certainly seems fallacious. An intrinsic\nUnnaturalness Argument, therefore, is in a much weaker epistemic\nposition than an argument for the conclusion that it is wrong to kill\na healthy person for his or her organs.\n3. The Moral Confusion Argument\n\n\nIn the first journal article focusing on the ethics of chimeras,\nJason Scott Robert and Fran\u00e7oise Baylis (2003) puzzle over\nthe negative reaction exhibited by the public to human/non-human chimeras.\nSome people think that the public\u2019s reaction is explained by a widely\nheld belief in fixed and well-defined boundaries between species, or at\nleast between the human species and non-human species, but in fact \u201cno\nextant species concept justifies the erection of the fixed boundaries\nbetween human beings and nonhumans that are required to make breaching\nthose boundaries morally problematic\u201d (ibid., 6). Others think\nthat what people find objectionable is that crossing species boundaries\nconstitutes playing God, but many people do not believe in God and\nothers believe that God not only licenses, but enjoins the kind of\ncreative research involved in chimeras. Others think that people react\nto the prospect of chimeras with repugnance, but such reactions are not\nthemselves sufficient grounds for concluding that an activity is\nimmoral. Nor do people\u2019s beliefs in its being taboo to blur sharp and\nsignificant conceptual boundaries explain their negative reaction,\nbecause the conceptual boundary between humans and non-humans is not\nsharp.\n\n\nSo what does explain the public\u2019s negative reaction? Baylis and\nRobert speculate that people object to chimeras because\nthey accept the Moral Confusion Argument, according to which it is\nwrong to create chimeras because of the moral confusion that would be\ngenerated by the existence of individuals that cannot be definitively\nclassified as human or as non-human (ibid., 9). This moral\nconfusion would arise because people employ two distinct frameworks for\nunderstanding moral status: if an individual is a human being, then it\nhas full moral status, and it has that status independently of anyone\nelse\u2019s attitudes or intentions regarding it, but if an individual is a\nnon-human animal, then it does not have full moral status, and,\nfurther, the moral status it does have and the nature of the\nobligations we have towards it are contingent upon the attitudes and\nintentions of their human creators or overseers. For a borderline\nhuman/non-human chimera, it would not be clear which framework to employ\nand, consequently, it would not be clear what our moral obligations to\nthis entity would be. Would it be appropriate to kill it for\nfood, or would that be murder? Which set of biomedical research\nprotections would apply, the relatively weak constraints on animal\nresearch or the comparatively strong constraints on human subjects\nresearch?\n\n\nA real-life example that illustrates the possibility that chimera\nresearch might disrupt a useful social practice is the attempt in 1998\nby Stuart Newman (a professor of cell biology and anatomy) and Jeremy\nRifkin (an anti-biotechnology activist) to patent a broad range of\nchimeras resulting from the mixing of human and nonhuman embryonic\ncells (Heathcotte and Robert 2006; Rabin 2006). In 1987, then-United\nStates Commissioner of Patent and Trademarks, Donald Quigg had\nannounced that although human beings were not patentable,\nmulticellular living organisms, including animals, were. Newman and\nRifkin submitted their patent application in the hopes that either (a)\nthe patent would be issued, thus giving them the legal right to\nprevent people from creating such chimeras, or (b) the patent would\nnot be issued, forcing the United States Patent Office to clarify the\ndividing line between human beings and nonhuman animals. In the end,\nthe patent application was rejected, both on technical grounds as well\nas the grounds that it encompassed human beings, which were not\npatentable (Weiss 2005). The Patent Office, however, declined to offer any precise\ndetails as to how to evaluate whether a chimera counted as a human\nbeing or not. But what if, a proponent of the Moral Confusion Argument\nmight ask, the Patent Office had instead decided to revise their view\nand allow patents on human beings or to reject all patents on\nanimals. Either decision would have entailed significant changes in\nthe social practice of patenting with, arguably, significant\ncosts.\nMoreover, the existence of a borderline human/non-human chimera\nwould generate confusion regarding our existing relationships as we\nwere forced to revisit the general question of whether being a human\nbeing really is necessary and sufficient for full moral status. Such\nconfusion, Robert and Baylis say, \u201cthreatens the social fabric in\nuntold ways; countless social institutions, structures, and practices\ndepend upon the moral distinction drawn between human and nonhuman\nanimals\u201d (2003, 10). In these ways, then, \u201cthe creation of\nnovel beings that are part human and part nonhuman is sufficiently\nthreatening to the social order that for many this is sufficient reason\nto prohibit any crossing of species boundaries involving human beings\u201d\n(ibid., 10).\n\n\nThere appears to be no empirical evidence to support the\nsociological claim that the Moral Confusion Argument explains the\npublic\u2019s negative reaction. Among the voluminous social science\nresearch on public attitudes towards biotechnology, the U.S. Office of\nTechnology Assessment\u2019s (OTA) report on public perceptions of\nbiotechnology remains the most comprehensive study of its kind in many\nways. It found that consequentialist concerns were cited by only a\nmeager 1% (for environmental concerns) to 8% (for \u201cunforeseen\nconsequences\u201d) of the respondents who believed that creating\ncross-species plants or animals was morally wrong (Office of Technology\nAssessment 1987). Concerns about playing God and tampering with nature\nwere much more prevalent. And even if these concerns are unfounded, as\nBaylis and Robert contend, it is surely fallacious to conclude that\nthey are not motivating the public\u2019s negative reaction. Conversely,\neven if the threat of moral confusion is a serious one, that does not\nalter the fact that it apparently did not even merit explicit mention by\nthe OTA.\n\n\nSetting aside the sociological claim that the public\u2019s acceptance of\nthe Moral Confusion Argument explains its reaction to chimeras, what\nabout the Moral Confusion Argument itself? (Robert and Baylis\nexplicitly refuse to endorse or reject the argument, but they do invite\nbioethicists to begin assessing its moral weight.)\n\n\nClaims that the social fabric will be threatened by the latest\nscientific research are usually vague and ill-defined enough so as to\nresist conclusive refutation, but two things seem clear about\nthe Moral Confusion Argument. First, it seems highly unlikely that\nchimera research would cause significant confusion along the lines\ndescribed. Second, even if chimeras were to cause confusion, that would\nnot provide much, if any, moral reason against creating them.\n\n\nAs to the first point, chimeras that are truly difficult to\ndefinitively classify as human or non-human are purely hypothetical.\nEven the chimeras involving the most extensive mixing to date\n(Goldstein et al. 2002; Muotri et al. 2005; James et al. 2006) resulted\nonly in individuals easily classified as non-human animals. Such easily\ncategorized individuals pose no more threat to our views about moral status\nthan does a human being with a pig heart valve, that is, no threat\nwhatsoever. Hence, the idea that such confusion is threatened by\n\u201cany crossing of species boundaries involving human beings\u201d\n(Robert and Baylis 2003, 10; emphasis added) is surely mistaken. And\neven if researchers were to create chimeras that were truly on the\nborder between human and non-human, it still would not follow that\nthere would be significant confusion as to the proper moral framework\nfor their treatment. If the chimeras were clearly persons (by\nexhibiting a high degree of autonomy, rationality, self-awareness,\netc.), then it would be clear to most people that they have full moral\nstatus, even if it would not be clear what species they were. As Andrew\nSiegel (2003, 33) notes, most people hold the belief that \u201cspecies\ndoesn\u2019t matter where one possesses other traits that confer moral\nstanding.\u201d Those who do mistakenly believe that being a human being is\nnecessary for full moral status might simply correct their mistaken\nbelief when confronted with an actual example of a non-human or\nborderline-human that was clearly a person. Only the remaining people\nwho retain that belief would be confused.\n\n\nPotentially more confusing would be an individual that was clearly a\nnon-person but who had just enough human material that they could not\nbe definitively classified as human or as non-human; for example, a\nblastocyst-stage chimpanzee embryo which has had half of its inner\ncell mass replaced with hESCs. But even in this extreme case, those\nwho believe that a fully-human conceptus has no moral status prior to\nthe onset of consciousness will simply conclude that a\nblastocyst-stage chimeric conceptus has no moral status either. Those\nwho believe that a fully human conceptus has full moral status from\nconception would need to decide how to classify such a chimera and may\nbe confused by the situation. But it is unclear why Robert and Baylis\nthink that someone\u2019s being confused about the specific case of the\nchimera would also make them revisit their general belief that being a\nhuman being is sufficient for full moral status. If the clear lack of\npersonhood of a human embryo or fetus does not cause such people to\nrevisit the general issue, why would the clear lack of personhood of a\nchimeric embryo, which would seem to have even less going for it from\nthis perspective, cause them to revisit it? Indeed, it is not clear\nwhy borderline cases pose any challenge to a general belief about\nnecessary and sufficient conditions. Someone who believes that being a\nmale sibling is necessary and sufficient for being a brother will not\nbe led to doubt that biconditional by the existence of an intersex\nperson who is on the border between being male and being female. To\nthe extent that it is vague whether the individual is male, it is also\nvague whether the individual is a brother.\n\n\nSo confusion would really only arise for certain subgroups of people\nwith specific beliefs and with respect to chimeras that are, at the\npresent time, purely hypothetical.\n\n\nAs to the second point, even supposing that chimeric research did\ncause society to revisit its views about the comparative moral worth\nof humans and nonhumans, it still remains that this would provide\nlittle reason not to create chimeras. Indeed, it seems more plausible\nthat this would provide, on balance, a reason to create\nthem. Returning to the example of Stuart and Rifkin\u2019s patent\napplication for chimeras, although the United States Patent Office\ndeclined to offer guidance on distinguishing humans from nonhumans for\nthe purpose of patent law, legal scholars have begun to address this\nissue (Stankovi\u0107 2005; Zylstra 2012). Of course, it is logically\npossible that their scholarly efforts will result in changes to patent\nlaw that will be for the worse, but that bare possibility is clearly\ninsufficient to justify an ethical condemnation of the scientists who\ncreated chimeras that led to Newman and Rifkin\u2019s patent application\nwhich in turn led to scholarly efforts that might in turn lead to\nnegative changes in patent law. As another, more urgent example,\nconsider that our willingness to place the gustatory interests of\nhumans ahead of the interests of non-human animals in avoiding pain,\nsuffering, and death has been one of the greatest causes of\nunnecessary suffering in history (Scully 2002). In the United States\nalone, there are approximately 9.5 billion agricultural animals\nslaughtered each year, even though a vegetarian diet could easily\nsatisfy most Americans\u2019 nutritional needs (Humane Society of the\nUnited States 2009). (This count excludes marine animals, which could\neasily triple the total, and for whom death almost inevitably comes\nfrom either suffocation or being crushed.) Revisiting the moral views\nthat are invoked to support this situation is probably essential to\nimproving this social institution. Thus, to prevent scientific\nresearch on the grounds that it would force people to reexamine our\nviews about moral status would be to prevent not only scientific\nprogress but urgently needed moral progress as well.\n4. The Borderline-Personhood Argument\n\n\nMost groups that have issued an opinion on chimeras acknowledge the\nexistence of traditional animal ethics issues, but are content to\nassert without argument that the use of non-human animals in chimeric research is\njustified because of its scientific and, ultimately, clinical\nimportance. On the one hand, this attitude seriously underestimates the\ndifficulties, abundantly articulated in the animal ethics literature,\nof justifying the use of non-human animals along these lines without either (a)\nimplying false and morally odious conclusions about research on\ncognitively disabled humans or (b) taking an uncharitable view of the\ncognitive capacities of non-human animals that is inconsistent with current\nresearch on animal psychology. On the other hand, this attitude\nprobably reflects a realistic assessment of the limited willingness of\nthese groups\u2019 audiences (primarily scientists and research oversight\nbodies) to seriously consider the possibility that most animal research\nis ethically unjustifiable. The earliest evaluation of chimeras in terms of traditional animal ethics considerations is by David DeGrazia,\nwho has argued that the psychological characteristics of great apes\n(chimpanzees, bonobos, gorillas, and orangutans) makes them \u201cborderline\npersons.\u201d Borderline persons have full, or near-full moral status,\nwhich makes it unethical to use borderline persons in what DeGrazia\ncalls \u201cneural chimeric research,\u201d research intended to lead to the\ngrowth of human neurons in the subjects\u2019 brains (DeGrazia 2007,\n325).\n\n\nWhat is it to be a person? Being a human being (viz., being a member\nof the species Homo sapiens) is neither necessary nor\nsufficient for being a person: newborns are human beings but are not\nyet persons, and members of other advanced, now-extinct hominid\nspecies were persons but were not human beings. Rather, DeGrazia says,\nto be a person is to have the capacity for sufficiently complex forms\nof consciousness (ibid., 319). More specifically, albeit\nstill vaguely, to be a person is to have \u201cenough\u201d of the\nfollowing properties to a \u201chigh enough\u201d degree: autonomy,\nrationality, self-awareness, linguistic competence, sociability, moral\nagency, and intentionality in action (ibid., 320).\n\n\nGreat apes deliberate, plan, and reason, thus displaying rationality\nand the capacity for intentional action. They exhibit bodily\nself-awareness, as evidenced through imitations of bodily gestures and\ntheir reactions to mirrors. They also exhibit social self-awareness, as\nevidenced by their knowledge of their position within their group\u2019s\nsocial hierarchies. Their social self-awareness also, ipso facto,\ndemonstrates their sociability, which is also implied by the cultural\ntransmission of accumulated knowledge in primate communities. The\nexistence of a limited degree of moral agency is also supported by\napparently altruistic actions for which no conditioning or instinctual\nexplanation seems plausible.\n\n\nAlthough great apes exhibit such forms of consciousness, DeGrazia also\nnotes that primarily because of their lack of linguistic competence\n(itself important to personhood and also relevant because it limits\nthe cognitive capacities available), non-linguistically trained great\napes \u201care not so well endowed with [personhood-relevant] traits\nthat they clearly qualify as persons\u201d (ibid.,\n321). They do not even fare well compared to normal human children,\nwho \u201care clearly capable of introspective awareness \u2026,\nrobustly competent in language, and more likely to show signs of\nautonomy\u201d (ibid., 322). Despite his use of the adverb\n\u201cclearly\u201d which suggests that this is an epistemic claim,\nthe conclusion is metaphysical: \u201cIt\u2019s not that we don\u2019t know\nenough about them to say whether they are persons. Rather, they exist\nin the gray area between paradigm persons and the vast majority of\nanimals who definitely are not persons\u201d (ibid.,\n322).\n\n\nSo what moral status do borderline persons have? On some views,\nmoral status is a binary property; an individual either has moral\nstatus or it does not. Given that all sentient animals have at least\nsome moral status, it would follow on such a view that all sentient\nanimals have full moral status. A fortiori, borderline persons, being\nsentient, would have full moral status.\n\n\nOn other views, moral status comes in degrees and while paradigmatic\npersons (individuals that fully satisfy the criteria for personhood)\nhave full moral status, merely sentient animals (animals that are\nsentient but that are clearly not persons) have a lower degree of moral\nstatus. DeGrazia distinguishes between two views of what such a\ndifference in moral status consists in, the Unequal Consideration Model\nand the Unequal Interests Model. On the Unequal Consideration Model,\nthis difference consists in its being the case that the interests of\nparadigmatic persons matter more, in and of themselves, than the equal\ninterests of merely sentient animals. For example, causing a harm of a\ncertain magnitude to a paradigmatic person is morally worse than\ncausing a harm of the same magnitude to a merely sentient animal, even\nsetting aside the fact that the harm to the paradigmatic person might\nwell cause additional negative effects not caused by inflicting the\nsame harm on a merely sentient animal (Harman 2003).\n\n\nAccording to the Unequal Interests Model, the difference in moral\nstatus between paradigmatic persons and merely sentient animals\nconsists in the fact that paradigmatic person have interests of\nsignificantly greater weight than the interests of merely sentient\nanimals. These weightier interests mean that killing a paradigmatic\nperson and thereby frustrating those interests will generally be\nmorally worse in and of itself than killing a merely sentient animal.\nMoreover, harms that appear comparable at first glance, say, causing a\ncertain kind of injury, are generally morally worse in and of\nthemselves, when inflicted upon a paradigmatic person than on a merely\nsentient animal. This is because the same kind of injury is likely to\nimpair the interests of the paradigmatic person more severely than it\nwould the interests of a merely sentient animal.\n\n\nIt should be noted that the Unequal Consideration Model is compatible\nwith assigning moral significance to the difference in interests cited\nby the Unequal Interest Model. A proponent of the Unequal\nConsideration Model could, for example, agree that being confined in a\ncage generally causes a much greater harm to a paradigmatic person\nthan to a merely sentient animal. Differences between the two\nframeworks arise when the harms to the interests of the individuals\nare not merely similarly describable (e.g., \u201cbeing\nconfined\u201d), but are in fact of equal magnitude: the Unequal\nInterests Model is committed to the conclusion that such harms are\nequally morally problematic in and of themselves while the Unequal\nConsideration Model is compatible with the conclusion that the harm to\nthe paradigmatic person is more morally problematic in and of itself\nthan the equal harm to the merely sentient animal.\n\n\nAccording to these two models, what moral status do borderline\npersons have? DeGrazia\u2019s argument continues: personhood-relevant\nproperties come in degrees, and so on the Unequal Consideration Model,\nit is plausible to say that the amount of consideration an individual\nis due is proportional to its \u201ccognitive, emotional, and social\ncomplexity\u201d (DeGrazia 2007, 323). Depending on how fine-grained the\naccount is, borderline persons would therefore either have the same\nmoral status as a paradigmatic person (viz., full moral status) or, at\nmost, be due only slightly less consideration than paradigmatic\npersons.\n\n\nAccording to the Unequal Interest Model, the difference between\nparadigmatic persons and borderline persons consists in their different\ninterests. But, here again, DeGrazia maintains, the differences between\nparadigmatic persons and borderline persons are relatively slight, and\nso on this account of moral status, borderline persons will either have\nfull moral status or, at most, have a moral status very near full moral\nstatus.\n\n\nOn any reasonable view of moral status, then, there will not be a\nlarge difference between the consideration due a borderline person and\nthe consideration due a paradigmatic person, and a borderline person\nshould therefore be viewed as analogous to a child: \u201cnot as\nsubstantially autonomous or as having full-fledged moral agency but as\ndeserving moral protections of full strength\u201d (ibid.,\n323).\n\n\nSuch an individual, with full or near-full moral status, should not be\nused in research unless (a) the research is more or less compatible\nwith the individual\u2019s best interests, (b) poses no more than minimal\nrisk, except where greater risks are justified by therapeutic\npotential to the individual, and (c) the individual has not\nmeaningfully dissented, unless participation is of pressing\ntherapeutic urgency for the individual (ibid., 323). But\nneural chimeric research does not come close to satisfying those\nstandards. The research is more than minimal risk, is not intended for\nany therapeutic benefit for the animal, and at this experimental\nstage, could not reasonably be intended as such. To take an extreme,\nalbeit hypothetical, example, the idea of a human/chimp neural chimera\nin which the human and chimp phenotypic traits are thoroughly mixed is a chilling\none. All great apes are social creatures, and such an individual might\nwell be rejected by both species, evoking the tragic plight of\nFrankenstein\u2019s monster. DeGrazia\u2019s argument, however, does not only\napply to such science fiction scenarios. Although he does not draw\nthis conclusion, if great apes have full or near-full moral status,\nthen it is probably impermissible to use them in any kind of chimeric\nresearch in which scientists are currently interested.\n\n\nDefenders of research on non-human animals typically object that\narguments against such research are overbroad. Where a defender of\nanimal research would locate the main problem with the\nBorderline-Personhood Argument depends on whether moral status is a\nbinary property or whether it admits of degrees. If moral status is a\nbinary property, then, given that even merely sentient animals have\nsome moral status, it follows that even merely sentient animals have\nfull moral status. The Borderline-Personhood Argument then implies\nthat any research on any sentient animal is subject to conditions\n(a)\u2013(c). Given that all vertebrates are sentient, this would\nprohibit the use of any vertebrates, even guppies, in any\nnon-therapeutic research that was more than minimal risk, irrespective\nof how large the benefit for other individuals might be. Although some\nanimal rights theorists would accept this conclusion, defenders of\nanimal research will take it as a reductio of the Borderline-Person\nArgument, maintaining that if full moral status really is as\nubiquitous as that, then DeGrazia\u2019s claim about the research\nprotections owed individuals with full or near-full moral status is\noverly strict.\n\n\nIf moral status admits of degrees, then the defender of animal\nresearch would locate the main problem with the Borderline-Personhood\nArgument in its claim that there are only slight differences in\npersonhood-relevant properties between borderline persons and\nparadigmatic persons. In fact, the differences between even a\nlanguage-trained chimpanzee and a normal adult human are quite large.\nAs DeGrazia himself argues elsewhere, for example, only normal adult\nhumans are capable of what he calls \u201cfull-fledged moral\nagency\u201d (1996, 199\u2013210). Now, the Borderline-Personhood\nArgument only requires that borderline personhood be sufficient, not\nnecessary, for full or near-full moral status, but both the Unequal\nConsideration Model and the Unequal Interests Model quite generally\nrelate moral status to personhood-relevant properties. The question\ntherefore arises as to why these vast differences in\npersonhood-relevant properties do not underwrite a large difference in\nmoral status and a concomitant difference in the research protections\nowed to individuals of the two groups.\n\n\nDeGrazia could respond that, were they to do so, it would follow\nthat human borderline persons (he gives the example of an 18\nmonth toddler) would also have significantly reduced moral status,\nwhich is false (ibid., 322). But there are two problems with\nthis reply. First, it begs the question of why, on his view, there\nisn\u2019t a large difference in moral status between human borderline\npersons and human paradigmatic persons. The fact that large variations\nin personhood-relevant properties do not seem to affect the moral\nstatus of humans might support a very coarse-grained or threshold view\nof moral status, but it might instead indicate that personhood-relevant\nproperties are not as central to moral status as the Unequal\nConsideration Model and the Unequal Interest Model posit (Kittay 2005).\nSecond, if, as this response presupposes, the lack of\npersonhood-relevant properties of a non-human reduces its moral status\nonly if the same lack of personhood-relevant properties would reduce to\nthe same degree the moral status of a human, then the range of\nnon-humans with full or near-full moral status is much larger than\nDeGrazia seems willing to concede. After all, despite the near complete\nabsence of personhood-relevant properties of a healthy but premature\ninfant or an elderly person in the late stages of dementia, such\nindividuals have full or near-full moral status and are owed\nsignificant protections against being harmed in research (even though\ntheir cognitive capacities might affect what kinds of treatments are\nharms). Extending full or near-full moral status to all non-humans who\nsatisfied such a minimal threshold would have implications comparable\nto those of the view that moral status is a binary property, and\ndefenders of animal research would find them equally implausible.\n\n\nIt should be noted that the U.S. National Institutes of Health has\nceased funding biomedical research with chimpanzees, and many private\ncompanies have followed suit (Collins 2015; Human Society of the\nUnited States n.d.). With Gabon being the only remaining country that\nhas a captive research population of chimpanzees (Nature 2011), the\nquestion remains as to how applicable DeGrazia\u2019s arguments are to\nother great apes and other non-human primates.\nMore recent evaluations of chimeras in traditional animal ethics\nterms include work by Shaw, Dondorp, & de Wort (2014), who apply a\nthree R\u2019s framework (focusing on reduction, refinement, and\nreplacement) to argue for a generally favorable conclusion regarding\nthe use of chimeric non-human primates as a source of organs for\nxenotransplantation. (For a critical response, see Palacios-Gonz\u00e0les\n(2016)).\n5. The Human Dignity Argument\n\n\nAlthough an evaluation of chimeric research in terms of human\ndignity was first put forward by Josephine Johnston and Christopher\nEliot (2003), since then Philip Karpowicz, Cynthia Cohen, and Derek van\nder Kooy (2004, 2005, Cohen 2007) have been the main proponents of this\nview, and I will follow them here.\n\n\nAn approach to chimeric research in terms of human dignity needs to\nprovide an account of (a) what human dignity is, (b) what kinds of\nindividuals have human dignity, (c) what moral implications human\ndignity has, in terms of generating moral prohibitions, requirements,\nor presumptions, and (d) what constraints those moral implications\nplace on chimeric research.\n\n\nHuman dignity is a kind of \u201cunconditioned and incomparable\nworth\u201d (Karpowicz et al. 2005, 119) and individuals with dignity\nare therefore \u201cuniquely valuable and worthy of respect\u201d\n(ibid., 120). Human dignity, understood in this rarefied way,\nis distinct from the common kind of dignity manifested by someone who\nresponds to difficult circumstances in a dignified manner. Although a\nperson can be stripped of this common kind of dignity by being placed\nin degrading circumstances such treatment would be said to violate,\nnot eliminate or diminish, human dignity in the rarefied sense; thus\nthe two concepts are distinct. Indeed, the individual\u2019s dignity in the\nrarefied sense is often alleged to explain what is problematic about\neliminating this common kind of dignity.\n\n\nHuman dignity is grounded in the possession of certain morally\nvaluable cognitive and emotive capacities, and it is because these\ncapacities are valuable that individuals with human dignity are\nthemselves valuable. Accounts of which capacities are relevant vary,\nbut typically include the following: reasoning, autonomous choice,\ncomplex communication, participation in social relations, sympathy, and\nempathy. Those who possess such dignity-grounding capacities have human\ndignity.\n\n\nWhat kind of moral implications does human dignity have? Although it\nis common to invoke human dignity in condemning a wide range of\nnefarious and odious practices, proponents of human dignity are\nnotoriously vague both on the general principles generated by human\ndignity and on how those principles tell against the activities in\nquestion (Macklin 2003). Part of the vagueness lies in the fact that\nproponents of human dignity frequently use language that implies that\nhuman dignity itself is the subject of the wrong (e.g.: \u201ctorture\nundermines human dignity\u201d, \u201chuman cloning denigrates human\ndignity\u201d), but if we instead understand such language as\nshorthand for saying that an individual with human dignity is wronged,\nand is wronged in a way relating to that individual\u2019s\ndignity-grounding capacities, then the following moral implications\nseem plausible. If an individual with human dignity is uniquely\nvaluable and worthy of respect because she possesses morally valuable\ndignity-grounding capacities, then there would be a presumption\nagainst interfering with the development, maintenance, or exercise of\nher dignity-grounding capacities. More strongly, there might even be a\npositive duty to support the development, maintenance, and exercise of\nher dignity-grounding capacities. The proponent of human dignity is\nalso likely to hold that dignity-grounding capacities and the\nindividuals that possess them have a kind of moral value not\nsusceptible to utilitarian or, more broadly, consequentialist\ntrade-offs. Hence, these presumptions will not be rebuttable merely by\nappeals to increased utility or value. This does not, of course,\ncommit the proponent of human dignity to the claim that the\npresumptions are absolute, but it does mean that the presumptions will\nprobably correspond to rights with a relatively high degree of\nstringency.\n\n\nHow, then, do considerations of human dignity give rise to an\nobjection to certain kinds of chimeric research? Karpowicz et al. say\nthe following:\n\n\n\nBy giving nonhumans some of the physical components necessary for\ndevelopment of the capacities associated with human dignity, and\nencasing these components in a nonhuman body where they would either\nnot be able to function at all or function only to a highly diminished\ndegree, those who would create human-nonhuman chimeras would denigrate\nhuman dignity. The torturer or the enslaver of human beings denies them\nthe option of exercising the capacities associated with human dignity.\nThe creator of the human-nonhuman chimera would do even\nworse\u2014he or she knowingly would diminish or eliminate the\nvery capacities associated with human dignity. (ibid.,\n120\u2013121)\n\n\n\nSo, human dignity generates not only a moral prohibition on denying\npeople with human dignity the option of exercising the capacities\nassociated with human dignity, it also generates a moral prohibition\non diminishing or eliminating those capacities themselves. Chimeric\nresearch, especially the introduction of an undissociated mass of\nhuman stem cells into an animal blastocyst-stage embryo\n(ibid., 126), has the potential to run afoul of this second\nmoral prohibition because such a transplant raises the possibility of\nconferring upon an individual some of the physical components\nnecessary (presumably, biologically necessary) for the development of\ndignity-grounding capacities, but without enabling the individual to\nsignificantly exercise those capacities. Such research, Karpowicz et\nal., maintain, therefore diminishes or eliminates those capacities,\nand is therefore unethical.  As an admittedly fantastical example of\nresearch that would run afoul of the prohibition, Karpowicz et\nal. consider transplanting an entire human brain into a nonhuman\nprimate: \u201cthe decision to manufacture a nonhuman research\nsubject with a human brain and, at most, diminished capacities for\nvarious forms of human-like cognition and action would violate human\ndignity\u201d (ibid., 123).\n\n\nThere are two main problems with the Human Dignity Argument.\n\n\nTo see the first problem, notice that despite the terminology of\nhuman dignity, whether some non-human animals have the\ncapacities that ground human dignity and whether some humans lack the\ncapacities that ground human dignity are empirical questions. As to\nthe former, Karpowicz et al. maintain that \u201c[t]he family of\ncapacities associated with human dignity seem to belong uniquely to\nhuman beings\u201d (ibid., 122); as to the latter, they\nmaintain that \u201cthose who are human and yet display a limited\nsubset of these capacities, say, the newborn infant or the person with\nsevere disabilities, still have human dignity\u201d (ibid.,\n121). These answers are inconsistent.  If the dignity-grounding\ncapacities of a human infant are sufficient to give it human dignity,\nthen the many non-human animals with the same or greater degree of\ndignity-grounding capacities have human dignity as\nwell. Alternatively, if a chimpanzee\u2019s lack of dignity-grounding\ncapacities is sufficient to imply that it does not have human dignity,\nthen the even more meager dignity-grounding capacities of a human\ninfant are also sufficient to imply that it does not have\nhuman dignity.\n\n\nIt is worth noting that this objection does not presuppose any\nparticular amount of dignity-grounding capacities as being necessary or\nsufficient for human dignity. Given the fact that some non-human\nanimals possess the kind of cognitive and emotive capacities cited by\nKarpowicz et al. to a greater degree than some humans, it cannot be the\ncase that (a) those capacities determine whether an individual has\nhuman dignity, (b) that all humans have human dignity, and (c) that no\nnon-human has human dignity. This is true no matter how strict or\nlenient one wishes to be regarding how many of the dignity-grounding\ncapacities an individual must possess to have human dignity.\n\n\nThe second problem for the Human Dignity Argument lies in its claim\nthat dignity-grounding capacities have been diminished or eliminated\nwhenever (a) we give an individual some of the physical components\nbiologically necessary for the development of dignity-grounding\ncapacities and (b) we do not give it significant opportunity to\nexercise those capacities. Consider that having adequate blood pressure\nis a physical component biologically necessary for dignity-grounding\ncapacities. Stitching a wound on a mouse so that it regains adequate\nblood pressure, then, counts as giving it some of the physical\ncomponents biologically necessary for the dignity-grounding capacities,\nbut it fails to provide the mouse with a body sufficient for the\nsignificant exercise of those capacities. It is clearly false to\nmaintain that such a medical procedure diminishes or eliminates those\ncapacities or, more generally, that such a procedure violates human\ndignity in any way. Or, consider again DeGrazia\u2019s views about the\ncapacities of great apes. If he is right about those capacities,\nwhenever we provide for the biological needs of a great ape while\nfailing to provide them with intensive linguistic training, then we\nprovide them components necessary for dignity-grounding capacities\nwithout the opportunity for exercising them. It is implausible that\nsuch an activity is unethical, as implied by the Human Dignity\nArgument, but even if it were, considerations of human dignity seem\nirrelevant here.\n\n\nLater, Karpowicz et al. mention not the physical components\n\u201cnecessary\u201d for the dignity-grounding capacities, but\nrather those \u201cespecially associated\u201d or \u201cclosely\nconnected\u201d with the dignity-grounding capacities. This raises\nthe possibility that the physical capacities at issue are those\nsufficient for the possession of the dignity-grounding capacities. But\nresearch that confers the physical capacities sufficient for the\npossession of the dignity-grounding capacities ipso facto confers the\ndignity-grounding capacities themselves, in which case the research\nhas not diminished or eliminated the dignity-grounding capacities of\nthe animal research subject. Quite the opposite, the research secured\nthose capacities for the subject (Palacios-Gonz\u00e1lez 2015, 493).  More\ngenerally, the proponents of the human dignity argument face a dilemma\nthat limits their argument\u2019s relevance. On the one hand, if the\nintroduction of human stem cells into a non-human confers\ndignity-grounding capacities onto an animal that would otherwise not\nhave them, then the charge that such research diminishes or eliminates\nthose capacities is false. On the other hand, if the introduction\ndoes not confer dignity-grounding capacities, then the charge\nthat such research diminishes or eliminates those capacities is also\nfalse, as the capacities were never there to begin with.\n\n\nConsiderations of human dignity could ground an objection to research\nin which the subject possesses the dignity-grounding capacities at the\nstart of the research, but then has them eliminated or diminished\nduring the course of the research. Such research would certainly be\nobjectionable, but this cannot be the objection that Karpowicz et\nal. have in mind since they believe that non-humans do not have human\ndignity at the start of the research. Finally, considerations of human\ndignity could ground an objection to research in which, although the\nsubject does not possess the dignity-grounded capacities at the start,\nthe research brings it about that the subject comes to possess those\ncapacities but also prevents it from having the significant\nopportunity to exercise those capacities. The problem in such a case\nis not, pace Karpowicz et al., the elimination or diminution of those\ncapacities, but is rather the treatment of the subject after those\ncapacities have been acquired. This objection overlaps with the\nobjection implied by the Moral Status Framework, discussed in the next\nsection. The difficulty for the human dignity version of this\nobjection is to explain why the problematic feature of such research\nis best understood in terms of human dignity as opposed to moral\nstatus, autonomy, rights, and interests (Macklin 2003, DeGrazia\n2007).\nConsiderations of human dignity occupy a central place within\nGerman law: Germany\u2019s Basic Law says that \u201cHuman dignity shall\nbe inviolable.\u201d For extensive discussion of chimeras within the\nGerman legal context, see the German Ethics Council report,\n\u201cHuman-Animal Mixtures in Research\u201d (Deutscher Ethikrat,\n2013 [2011]). \n6. The Moral Status Framework\n\n\nAccording to the Moral Status Framework (Streiffer 2005), what is\ndistinctively problematic about chimera research is the possibility\nthat the introduction of human material would enhance an animal\u2019s\nmoral status to the level of a normal human adult without respecting\nthe moral obligations entailed by that status. That is, such research\nmight cause an animal, which would have had a comparatively low moral\nstatus, to instead have the moral status of a normal human adult, and\nyet the animal might continue to be treated in ways typical of animal\nresearch subjects and which would be profoundly unethical given its\nnew moral status.\n\n\nLet us say that an individual\u2019s moral status is enhanced if it is\nraised from a (significantly) lower degree of moral status to the\nmoral status of a normal adult human. The Moral Status Framework\nraises two general questions about chimeric research. First, under\nwhat circumstances is it permissible to perform research in which an\nanimal\u2019s moral status is enhanced? (If animals already have the same\nmoral status as a normal human adult, then the Moral Status Framework\nbecomes otiose, except as a possible sociological explanation of why\nsome people who believe that animals normally have a significantly\nlower moral status than humans might object to some kinds of chimeric\nresearch.) Second, under what circumstances would the introduction of\nhuman material actually enhance an animal\u2019s moral status?\n\n\nThe moral permissibility of research in which an animal\u2019s moral status\nis enhanced can be evaluated both from the perspective of the research\nsubject and from the perspective of others. From the perspective of\nthe subject, there would seem to be the following main\npossibilities. First, an enhancement in moral status might always be\nan unequivocal good. Any deleterious effects an enhancement might have\non other factors that are relevant from the subject\u2019s perspective are\nalways outweighed by the enhancement itself. This can be labeled the\nMillian View, since it echoes Mill\u2019s remark that it is better to be\nSocrates unsatisfied than a pig satisfied. (If one links moral status\nto the Kantian good will, it also echoes Kant\u2019s remark that the good\nwill, \u201cregarded in itself, is to be valued incomparably higher\nthan all that could merely be brought about by it in favor of some\ninclination and indeed, if you will, of the sum of all\ninclination\u201d (Groundwork, AK 4: 394). \n\n\nSecond, there is the opposite of the Millian View, the No-Enhancing\nView, which holds that conferring an enhanced moral status on an\nindividual is always objectionable from the individual\u2019s\nperspective.\n\n\nIntermediate between these extreme views are various Instrumentalist\nViews, according to which the evaluation of an enhancement from the\nindividual\u2019s perspective depends (at least in large part) on how the\nindividual\u2019s life compares, in terms of other independently relevant\nfactors, to the life that it either would have had (the Instrumentalist\nView with the Non-Moral Baseline) or to the life to which it is\nentitled, given its enhanced moral status (the Instrumentalist View\nwith the Moral Baseline). The two Instrumentalist Views disagree on the\nevaluation of research in which an enhanced individual\u2019s life is better\nthan it would have been had its status not been enhanced, but given its\nnew moral status, it deserves to have its life be even better.\n\n\nBoth of the extreme views are implausible. Imagine conferring an\nenhanced moral status on an individual, and then ensuring that it\nlives a life in which it receives much better treatment than it would\nhave gotten otherwise and in which it is given everything it is owed\nin virtue of that enhanced moral status. It is hard to see how this\noutcome could be objectionable from the individual\u2019s perspective, as\nimplied by the No-Enhancing View. Nor does such research seem\nobjectionable from the perspective of others. It might be objected,\nfor example, that bringing new individuals into existence that have\nthe (previously) distinctive moral status of normal human adults\nsomehow lessens the value of that status for extant humans, as\nexpanding membership in an exclusive club might lessen its value to\nits already existing members. That objection, however, is belied by\nthe fact that every time people reproduce, they engage in just such an\nactivity, and they produce far more individuals with human moral\nstatus than would ever be produced by chimeric research. Another\nobjection might be that the extension of human moral status to\n\u201clesser animals\u201d somehow diminishes the value of that\nstatus for humans, as extending a university diploma to those who do\nnot deserve it lessens the value of that diploma for those who do. If,\nhowever, a transplant truly has enhanced the moral status of the\nchimeric research subject, then in whatever sense we humans\n\u201cdeserve\u201d our special status, it now does as well, and so\nthe value placed on human moral status will not be lessened.\n\n\nThe Millian View is also implausible: what kind of life an\nindividual with an enhanced status will lead surely matters. My life is\nbetter than the life of even a very satisfied pig, but if my\nlife were filled with enough pain and misery, and with extremely\nlimited prospects, it arguably would be worse. Indeed, the Millian view\nis even too extreme for Mill, who agrees that some people\u2019s lives are\nfilled with \u201cunhappiness so extreme\u201d that they would be better off\nexchanging \u201ctheir lot for almost any other, however undesirable in\ntheir own eyes\u201d (1979 [1861], 9).\n\n\nThis leaves the Instrumentalist Views. If one of the Instrumentalist\nViews is correct, then the question arises as to whether the moral\nbaseline or the non-moral baseline is relevant. To decide between these\ntwo options, consider an example from the literature on exploitation in\nwhich a transaction provides someone with a benefit, but with far less\nbenefit than they deserve: an employer who pays an employee a wage that\nis beneficial compared to the alternatives, but is still substantially\nless than what justice requires. In such cases, the relevant baseline\nfor the evaluation of the work is the moral baseline: given that the\nemployee deserves more, it is no defense of the employer\u2019s behavior to\nsay that the employee is better off than he would have been without the\njob (see Wertheimer (1996, 289\u2013291) for extended discussion of the\nanalogous case of an exploitative marriage). Similarly, the relevant\nquestion for evaluating status-enhancing research is surely whether the\nsubject\u2019s new entitlements are respected.\n\n\nBecause the relevant baseline is the moral baseline, research in which\na non-human animal\u2019s moral status is enhanced to that of a normal\nhuman adult raises the following problem. The view institutionalized\nby animal research oversight committees is that almost any valid\nresearch objective justifies sacrificing even the most fundamental\ninterests of non-human animals (Francione 1995). In contrast, the view\ninstitutionalized by human subjects research oversight committees is\nthat humans have a moral status which provides them with substantial\nmoral protections, including a very stringent prohibition on harmful\nresearch without informed consent. So long as experiments that involve\nthe transplantation of human stem cells into non-human animals are\noverseen by animal research oversight committees, or by human subjects\ncommittees attentive only to concerns of those who provided the\ngametes or embryos from which the stem cells were derived, the wrong\nset of moral protections is likely to be afforded to status-enhanced\nchimeric research subjects. If the relevant baseline were the\nnon-moral baseline, then transplants that enhanced moral status\nprobably would be no more problematic than other kinds of biomedical\nresearch on animals.  But because the relevant baseline is the moral\nbaseline, sacrificing the fundamental interests of the chimeric\nresearch subject as they would have been sacrificed in any other\nanimal research is the moral equivalent of sacrificing the fundamental\ninterests of a fully functional adult human being. In status-enhancing\nresearch, what would have been animal confinement, pain, suffering,\nand death, becomes the moral equivalent of\u2014and, on an\nanthropocentric view, also becomes\u2014human confinement, pain,\nsuffering, and death. On all but the most extreme animal rights views,\nthis makes status-enhancing chimeric research much worse than other\nbiomedical research on animals, and on any plausible view, makes it\nabsolutely unacceptable.\n\n\nAlternatively, if researchers adequately respected the chimeric\nresearch subject\u2019s newly enhanced status, then this objection would\nnot apply to the research. But respecting the subject\u2019s newly enhanced\nstatus would most likely frustrate the researcher\u2019s aims since most\nbiomedical research on non-human animals is done on non-humans\nprecisely because it involves procedures that plainly would be\nunethical if performed on individuals with the moral status of a\nnormal human adult. And even if the researchers were willing to try to\nrespect the subject\u2019s newly enhanced status, it is hard to imagine\nthat they could come close to succeeding: what kind of life are they\nproposing to provide for this individual they have created and who is\nnow under their care? Moreover, even if the research in question would\nbe compatible with the protections due to an individual with the moral\nstatus of a normal human adult, another objection would then apply, at\nleast when the research is intended to provide human-relevant\ninformation. Regular, non-chimeric humans will typically provide a\nbetter model in which to learn about human development and in which to\ntest possible therapies intended for human beings. Thus, it would be\nscientifically preferable to perform the research procedures on\nregular human beings rather than on chimeras. To insist on performing\nsuch research on enhanced human/non-human chimeras when they could\nethically be performed on human beings, then, would be scientifically\nunjustified and would arguably constitute unethical exploitation of\nthe chimera for the benefit of others.\n\n\nIf almost any status-enhancing research would be unethical, then it is\nimportant to know what kinds of transplants could enhance an animal\u2019s\nmoral status. Progress on this question can be made by asking why\nnormal adult humans possess their comparatively high moral status.  On\ncognitive capacity views of moral status, an individual\u2019s cognitive\ncapacities give them their moral status, and the high-level cognitive\ncapacities that normal human adults have is what gives them their\nrelatively high moral status (VanDeVeer 1979). Given that high-level\ncognitive capacities are intimately related to the individual\u2019s brain,\nthis view obviously justifies focusing on transplants that could\naffect the brain in a way that enhances cognitive capacities.\nHowever, there are many constraints on the ability of human stem cells\nto significantly enhance an animal\u2019s cognitive capacities. In some\ncases, the subject will be terminated before the development of the\nrelevant cognitive capacities, thus side-stepping the entire\nproblem. In many cases, cognitive enhancements would likely be\nprevented by the animal\u2019s smaller skull size and shorter gestation\nperiod, as well as by the surrounding non-human cellular environment\nthat would provide developmental cues to transplanted cells (Karpowicz\net al. 2005, 124\u2013126). In 2015, the National Institutes\nof Health hosted a workshop on research with animals containing human\ncells. Janet Rossant, chair of the workshop and a leading figure in\nchimera research, summarized several of presentations from current\nresearches as follows:\n\n\nThe state of the art today from all the contributors we heard was that\nyou can do these experiments, if you make the cells perhaps a bit more\nnaive then you can get cells into the blastocyst, but the\ncontributions that you see in post-implantation fetuses are very\nlow. They\u2019re not necessarily in all tissues, and the contributions are\nquite dispersed. So nobody showed us a very extensive contribution of\nhuman cells into an interspecies chimera (National Institutes of\nHealth 2015).\n\n\nFor the kinds of research currently underway, it seems highly\nimplausible that human cells could have significant effects on\ncognitive capacities. There are, however, a few caveats that should be\nnoted.\n\nFirst, following Rossant\u2019 summary, the scientists present had\nextensive discussion about strategies for improving the rates of\nchimerism. Considered purely as a scientific problem, there seems to\nbe significant interest in overcoming the current limitations which\nprevent human cells from having much of an impact. Moreover,\nexceptions to Rossant\u2019s generalization were mentioned later in the\nworkshop, including research in which human neural progenitor cells\nproliferated \u201cextensively\u201d when injected into the adult mouse brain,\nresearch in which some cell lineages continued to act like the\ndonor-species cell regardless of the surrounding animal environment,\nand research in which human-derived glial progenitor cells outcompeted\nthe corresponding mouse glial, \u201cultimately dominating the brain\u201d.\n Second, some researchers might be interested in designing experiments\nthat intentionally seek to overcome existing limitations on cognitive\ndevelopment in non-human animals. Some might want to do basic research\non the neurological development involved in language acquisition,\nmathematical concept acquisition, moral development, or any number of\nother cognitive capacities that are now limited to normally\nfunctioning human beings. Other researchers might be interested in creating chimeras\nin which the limitations on animal\u2019s cognition are overcome so that\nthey can be used as models to study diseases or injuries that impair\nhigh-level cognitive functions in humans. As noted by the NAS\nCommittee,\n\n\n\n[T]he idea that human neuronal cells might participate in\n\u201chigher-order\u201d brain functions in a nonhuman animal,\nhowever unlikely that may be, raises concerns that need to be\nconsidered. Indeed, if such cells are to be used in therapeutic\ninterventions, one needs to know whether they could participate in\nthat way in the context of a treatment. (NAS 2005, 33)\n\n\n\nStatus-enhancing research performed for such ends, were it ever to\nbecome more than science fiction, would be deemed impermissible by the\nMoral Status Framework.\n\n\nSecond, it is not yet clear what kinds of cognitive enhancements might\nbe possible even within a constrained environment. For example, it is\npossible to use genetic engineering to enhance the learning and memory\nof mice without modifying skull size or gestational period (Tang et\nal. 1999). Further, the incorporation of human glia and astrocytes\ninto the brains of neonatal mice was found to \u201csharply enhance\u201d their\nlearning (Han et al. 2013, Cossins 2013, Cole 2013). More extremely,\nif large quantities of hESCs are introduced during the early stages of\nembryonic development, it is possible that the cells themselves could\ninduce changes that would eliminate some of the constraints mentioned\nabove. Although some of the experiments cited above do involve the\nintroduction of hES and neural progenitor cells early in development,\nexperience in this area is limited. As the NAS Committee\nconcluded,\n\n\n\nThis approach [the introduction of human ES cells into a non-human\nblastocyst] is an obvious extension of techniques widely used in\nresearch with [mouse ES] cells\u2014namely, aggregation of\nmorulas from two mice or injection of mES cells into mouse blastocysts.\nIn both cases, the cells can contribute extensively to any mouse that\narises from implantation of such a chimeric blastocyst. Clearly, an\nanimal (e.g., mouse) blastocyst into which human cells are transplanted\nraises other issues because potentially the inner cell mass, the\nprogenitor of the fetus, would consist of a mixture of human and mouse\ncells. It is not now possible to predict the extent of human\ncontribution to such chimeras. (NAS 2005, 34; for further discussion\nsee Streiffer (2005, 355\u2013357, 363\u2013364).)\n\n\n\nIt therefore seems premature to place much confidence in our ability\nto draw a precise line between transplants during the embryonic stages\nof development that will, and those that will not, enhance an animal\u2019s\ncognitive capacities. Moreover, even among those who favor a\ncognitive-capacities view of moral status, it is contentious just what\nlevel of cognitive capacities is needed to attain full moral\nstatus.\n\n\nOn anthropocentric views of moral status, normal human adults have\nthe moral status they do simply because they are human beings, that is,\nbecause they are members of the species Homo sapiens (Noonan\n1970; Devine 1978; Schwarz 1990). As has often been noted,\nanthropocentric views seem to suffer from an explanatory gap: it is\nhard to see how being a member of a certain species could give an\nindividual its moral status (Regan 1978; Feinberg 1980; DeGrazia 1996,\n56\u201361). Nonetheless proponents of these views argue\nthat they provide the only way to adequately explain the equal moral\nstatus of all human beings, even human beings who lack high-level\ncognitive capacities, and thereby to avoid the so-called \u201cmarginal\ncases\u201d that afflict cognitive capacity views.\n\n\nAnthropocentric views raise difficult questions about how much human\nmaterial an individual needs in order to be a human being. Since normal\nhuman embryos are both human and organisms, they are human beings,\nalbeit ones at the earliest stages of development (Feinberg 1980,\n288\u2013291). But when faced with an organism that has\nsome human cells and some non-human cells, how is one to decide whether\nthe organism is human, and hence, whether it is a human being? It is\noverly narrow to focus on transplants that affect neural tissue, since\nit is not plausible to suppose that an individual must have a human\nbrain to be a human being: an anencephalic infant is a human being and\nwould possess human moral status on an anthropocentric view.\nPresumably, replacing the entire inner cell mass of an animal\nblastocyst with hESCs would suffice to make the resulting\nindividual a human being since, in normal human development, the inner\ncell mass is what goes on to form the fetus. In such cases, one could,\nat least in principle, end up with a human being surrounded by a\nnon-human trophectoderm (the layer of cells surrounding the embryo\nwhich goes on to form the placental structures). If an anthropocentric\nview of moral status is correct then the Moral Status Framework would\nclearly condemn such research. On the other hand, having only a few\nnon-human cells in the final individual would not suffice since a human\nwith a porcine heart valve is still a human being. But where to draw\nthe line is unclear, similar to the situation with objects that have\nvague identity conditions (Parfit 1984, 231\u2013243;\nThomson 1987; Thomson 1997; Piotrowska 2014).\n\n\nIn sum, then, although the Moral Status Framework appears to provide\na sound objection to status-enhancing research, its application is\nnonetheless hampered by the empirical uncertainties regarding the\neffects that various kinds of hESC transplants would have and the moral\nuncertainties regarding which effects would be status-enhancing.\n7. Conclusion\n\n\nThe Unnaturalness Argument raises concerns about the unnaturalness\nof crossing species boundaries, and while it is sufficiently inchoate\nthat it may perhaps resist conclusive refutation, it is nonetheless a\nvery weak objection and it fails to provide any reasons for those who\ndo not object to chimeric research to change their minds. The Moral\nConfusion Argument has been alleged to be at the heart of the public\ncontroversy, but this allegation is not supported by the extensive\nsocial science research on public attitudes towards modern\nbiotechnology. Moreover, the consequences posited by the argument as\nbeing morally problematic seem unlikely to occur, and were they to\noccur, would probably be beneficial in the long run, even at the cost\nof some short-term social disruption. The Borderline-Personhood\nArgument focuses on the personhood-relevant properties of great apes\nand concludes that their borderline status as persons confers a high\nenough degree of moral status to make most, if not all, chimeric\nresearch on them impermissible. Like other traditional animal ethics\narguments, though, the argument depends upon controversial claims about\nthe sufficient conditions for full, or near-full, moral status. The\nHuman Dignity Argument attempts to explain why partial humanization of\na certain sort is morally wrong, but mistakenly assumes that such\nresearch would eliminate or diminish an individual\u2019s dignity-grounding\ncapacities. The Moral Status Framework maintains that status-enhancing\nchimeric research is permissible only if reasonable assurances are in\nplace that the individual\u2019s enhanced moral status will be adequately\nrespected. There are, however, several empirical and ethical\nuncertainties as to which chimeric research, if any, would enhance a non-human\nanimal\u2019s moral status.\n\n\nThe foregoing has focused on the ethics of creating chimeras, but much\nof the ethics discussion has either attempted to infer public policy\nconclusions straightaway or has taken place within discussions\nabout what public policy should be. The recommendations of the\nNational Academies guidelines prohibit the introduction of hESCs into\nnonhuman primate blastocysts (NAS 2006, 41), citing concerns about the\npotential human contribution of such cells. The International Society\nfor Stem Cell Research guidelines prohibit research that involves\nintroduction embryos into which hESCs have been introduced into any\nhuman or nonhuman primate uterus (ISSCR 2006). Although the ISSCR\nguidelines do not provide a rationale for this prohibition, the only\npotentially relevant rationale articulated in the accompanying\ncommentary cites a concern for the creation of \u201chumanized cognition,\nawareness, or other mental attributes\u201d (Hyun et al. 2007,\n162). Both groups appear to intend their recommendation to apply to\nall institutions carrying out hESC research, including public\ninstitutions. President Obama\u2019s National Institutes of Health\nregulations prohibit federal funds for research in which hESCs are\nintroduced into nonhuman primate blastocysts (National Institutes of\nHealth 2009). And, of course, proponents of stem cell research\ntypically do not argue only that the research is permissible but also\nthat the research should be eligible for federal funding.\n\n\nIt should be noted, however, that caution is warranted when inferring\npublic policy conclusions from conclusions about substantive,\nfirst-order ethics about biotechnology (Streiffer and Hedemann\n2007). \n\n\nPublic policy should take into account public opinion and comply with\nnorms of transparency (Baylis 2009). With regard to public opinion,\nthe UK Human Fertilisation and Embryology Authority (HFEA) conducted a\n12-week public consultation in 2007 on chimeras and hybrids, providing\nbackground materials on the current state of science, law, and ethics\nand then soliciting people\u2019s opinions on a variety of ethical and\npolicy questions (Human Fertilisation and Embryology Authority\n2007a). Although the consultation did not focus on human/animal\nchimeras as defined in this entry, it did find significance opposition\nto creating human/non-human hybrids, inserting animal cells into human\nembryos, and inserting mitochondrial DNA from animals into human\nembryos. In terms of transparency, a review by Baylis (ibid.)\nof the consultation process found it to be \u201can exercise in strategic\npublic relations\u201d in many respects (ibid., 47) in which the\nHFEA\u2019s preexisting policy preference led to bias in the presentation\nand discussion of options as well as their interpretation and\nreporting of the results (ibid.). \n\n\nA deeper concern about legitimacy also applies to chimera\nresearch. Legal moralism, the view that the fact that an act is\nmorally wrong provides a legitimate reason for the state to ban it, is\nincompatible with very plausible views about the requirement that\nlegitimate public policy be based on considerations that are neutral\non certain kinds of issues. For example, even on the assumption that\nthe Unnaturalness argument, interpreted as a religious objection\nagainst interfering with God\u2019s plans, is sound, it still would not\nprovide legitimate grounds for a public policy restriction on\nchimeras. Similarly, proponents of chimera research cannot\nlegitimately argue that it should be funded, or even just that it\nshould be legally permitted, because it represents humanity\u2019s partial\nfulfillment of a divine imperative to acquire knowledge and improve\nthe human condition. Chimera research raises issues about\nunnaturalness, God\u2019s plan, human dignity, and the moral status of\nanimals and humans at all stages of development. To evaluate these\nissues in the context of chimera research, some scholars are beginning\nto develop faith-based frameworks as well as Aristotelian-Thomistic\nframeworks (DiSilvestro 2004; Degeling, Irvine, and Kerridge 2013;\nEberl and Ballard 2009).
