    "main_text": "\n1. The Origin and Development of the Lvov-Warsaw School\n\nKazimierz Twardowski (1866\u20131938) began his post as professor of\nphilosophy at Lvov University in 1895. He came to Lvov from Vienna,\nwhere he had studied philosophy under Franz Brentano and Robert\nZimmermann. Twardowski belonged to the last group of Brentano\u2019s\nstudents. His Habilitationschrift (1894) concerned the\nconcepts of the content and the object of presentations; it \nclarified and sharpened this important distinction. This work strongly\ninfluenced Meinong and Husserl.\n\nTwardowski appeared in Lvov with the ambitious plan of creating a\nscientific philosophy (in Brentano\u2019s spirit) in Poland (at that\ntime, Poland was partitioned between Austro-Hungary, Germany and\nRussia; Lvov belonged to the Austro-Hungarian Empire.) In fact, he\nsubordinated all his activities to achieving this task and\nconsiderably limited his own scientific work. Twardowski was an\nextraordinary and charismatic teacher. He very soon attracted many\nyoung people to philosophy. After ten years of teaching he sometimes\nhad about 200 candidates for seminars and 2000 attendants of his\nlectures. He propagated a clear style of writing and speaking about\nphilosophical matters, insisted upon justification of philosophical\ntheses and sharply distinguished philosophy as a science from\nworld-views. Following Brentano, he favoured problems on the\nborderline of descriptive psychology, grammar and logic (he\nsupplemented his object/content distinction by that of\nactions/products). A photo of Twardowski\u2019 seminar participants\ntaken during the 1925\u20131926 academic year is available (see the\n supplement),\n with most of the participants identified.\n\nAlthough Twardowski was not a logician and did not consider himself as\nsuch, his program formed a friendly environment for logic in all its\nsubdomains: formal logic, semantics and methodology of science. Jan\n\u0141ukasiewicz (1878\u20131956) was the first of Twardowski\u2019s\nstudents to be interested in logic. He began his lectures in logic in\nLvov in 1906. Kazimierz Ajdukiewicz (1890\u20131963), Tadeusz\nCze\u017cowski (1889\u20131981), Tadeusz Kotarbi\u0144ski\n(1886\u20131981) and Zygmunt Zawirski (1882\u20131948) studied\nmainly under Twardowski, but they also attended courses conducted by\n\u0141ukasiewicz. Stanis\u0142aw Le\u015bniewski (1886\u20131939)\njoined this circle in 1910. Warsaw appeared on the stage exactly in\n1915, when the University of Warsaw was reopened. The academic staff\nwas mainly imported from Lvov; \u0141ukasiewicz was appointed\nprofessor of philosophy.\n\nPoland recovered its independence in 1918 and Polish scholars began to\nbuild national academic life. The program for the development of\nmathematics elaborated by a mathematician Zygmunt Janiszewski (the\nJaniszewski program) had a great importance for the subsequent\ndevelopment of the LWS. According the Janiszewski program, Polish\nmathematicians should concentrate on set theory, topology and their\napplications to other branches of mathematics. In particular, the\nJaniszewski program attached great importance to mathematical logic\nand the foundations of mathematics. Two philosophers, namely\nLe\u015bniewski and \u0141ukasiewicz, became professors of the\nUniversity of Warsaw at the Faculty of Mathematical and Natural\nSciences. Both began intensive teaching of mathematical logic, mostly\namong mathematicians but also among philosophers. Thus, logic in the\nLWS had two parents: mathematics and philosophy.\n\nAlfred Tarski (1901\u20131983) opened the list of young\nmathematicians and philosophers attracted by logic in Warsaw. The\nlogical community in this city included (in alphabetical order and\ncovering the whole period 1918\u20131939: Stanis\u0142aw\nJa\u015bkowski (1906\u20131965), Adolf Lindenbaum (1904\u20131941?),\nAndrzej Mostowski (1913\u20131975), Moses Presburger (1904?\u20131943),\nJerzy S\u0142upecki (1904\u20131987), Boles\u0142aw Soboci\u0144ski\n(1904\u20131980; a philosopher by training)) and Mordechaj Wajsberg\n(1902\u20131942?). The names of three other logicians who graduated\nshortly before 1939 or studied during War World II and began their\nacademic work after 1945 should be added, namely Jan Kalicki\n(1922\u20131953; a mathematician), Czes\u0142aw Lejewski\n(1913\u20132001; a classicist and philosopher) and Henryk Hi\u017c\n(1917; a philosopher).\n\nThe development of logic in Warsaw had two subperiods in\n1918\u20131939, namely 1918\u20131929 and 1929\u20131939. The first\ndecade consisted in intensive teaching and scientific work at the\nseminars of Le\u015bniewski and \u0141ukasiewicz. Not many results\nwere published at that time. The explosion of publications took place\nin 1929 and later. There are several factors which caused the\ndevelopment of mathematical logic in Poland. The Warsaw school of\nlogic appears to be model case, but the power of this circle\ninfluenced other places where the general environment was not so\nfavourable to logic. The fruitful co-operation of mathematicians and\nphilosophers in Warszawa had the utmost significance. The founders of\nthe Polish mathematical school made a brave experiment consisting in\ninviting two philosophers with a modest mathematical background as\nprofessors at the Faculty of Mathematics and Natural Sciences; this\ndid not happen in any other country. The gifts of Le\u015bniewski and\n\u0141ukasiewicz as teachers and the abilities of the latter as an\norganizer attracted young mathematicians. In Poland mathematical logic\nwas considered to be an autonomous science, not a part of mathematics\nor philosophy. From the present-day point of view this might seem as\nan exaggeration, but this ideology contributed essentially to the\nstrength of Polish logic. Their representatives were fairly conscious\nof the fact that the propagation and defence of the autonomy of this\nfield had to be confirmed by important scientific results and\ninternational recognition. Moreover, this view about logic motivated\nvarious purely theoretical investigations on formal systems. On the\nother hand, Polish logicians strongly insisted that logic should not\nbe restricted only to mathematics and required the co-operation of\nrepresentatives of all field in which logic might be used. Still\nanother factor played an important role, namely the conviction about\nthe social significance of logic as a weapon against all kinds of\nirrationalism. Tarski once said \u201cReligion [you can also say\n\u2018ideology\u2019 \u2014 JW] divides people, logic brings them\ntogether.\u201d According to \u0141ukasiewicz, \u201cLogic is\nmorality of thought and speech\u201d. Thus, Polish logicians doing\nlogic and teaching it were convinced that they were performing an\nimportant social service.\n\nKotarbi\u0144ski was appointed professor of philosophy in Warsaw in\n1919. His teaching activity resulted in a group of scholars working\nmainly in the philosophy of science, including Janina Hosiasson (later\nMrs. Lindenbaum; 1899\u20131942), Edward Pozna\u0144ski\n(1901\u20131976), Dina Sztejnbarg (later Mrs. Kotarbi\u0144ski)\n(1901\u20131997) and Aleksander Wundheiler (1902\u20131957).\n\nTwardowski and Ajdukiewicz (appointed professor in 1928) remained in\nLvov. They trained a group that included Izydora D\u0105mbska\n(1904\u20131983), Maria Kokoszy\u0144ska (1905\u20131981), Henryk\nMehlberg (1904\u20131978) and Zygmunt Schmierer (?\u20131943).\nAlthough Twardowski\u2019s students also taught at other Polish\nuniversities (Cze\u017cowski in Vilna, Zawirski in Pozna\u0144 and\nKrak\u00f3w), Lvov and Warsawa were the main centres of the LWS. The\nschool was also joined by a group of catholic philosophers, including\nFather Innocenty (J\u00f3zef) M. Boche\u0144ski (1902\u20131995)\nand Father Jan Salamucha (1904\u20131944).\n\nWorld War II had disastrous consequences for the LWS. Twardowski and\nLe\u015bniewski died before September 1, 1939. Of the people mentioned\nabove who lost their lives (mostly Jews murdered by the Nazis): the\nLindenbaums, Presburger, Salamucha, Schmierer and Wajsberg. Zawirski\ndied in 1947. Many emigrated from Poland during World War II or\nshortly after it: \u0141ukasiewicz (Dublin), Tarski (Berkeley),\nHi\u017c (Philadelphia), Kalicki (Berkeley), Lejewski (Manchester),\nMehlberg (Toronto, Chicago), Soboci\u0144ski (Notre Dame) and\nWundheiler (New York); Boche\u0144ski (Fribourge) and Pozna\u0144ski\n(Jerusalem, before 1939).\n\nThe situation in Poland in 1945\u20131948 was similar as before 1939.\nThe Marxist ideological offensive against bourgeois philosophy started\nin 1949. The policy became more liberal after 1956. Although many\nscholars of the LWS actively taught and worked in the new political\nreality, it would be difficult to say that the school continued its\nformer manner of existence. The tradition of the LWS was rather\npreserved in individual hands, but not as an organized enterprise.\n\nNote: the present essay focuses on the logical wing of the LWS. In\n1939, the entire school comprised about 80 scholars actively working\nin all branches of philosophy as well as in other academic fields,\nlike psychology, sociology, theoretical linguistics, history of art\nand literary studies.\n2. Metaphilosophy\n\nMost philosophers of the LWS understood philosophy as a collection of\ndisciplines, including logic, ethics, aesthetics, metaphysics, and\nepistemology. Philosophy is a science, like any other. All members of\nthe LWS inherited from Twardowski his main metaphilosophical claims\nconcerning clarity, justification and the separation of philosophy\nfrom world-views. It also meant a radical rejection of all kinds of\nirrationalism. A view, called anti-irrationalism by Ajdukiewicz,\ndemanded that every rationally accepted proposition be\nintersubjectively communicable and testable. Although there was no\na priori list of meaningful questions subjected to\nphilosophical work, one should be sceptical about so-called great\nmetaphysical problems and their scientific status. Philosophical\nactivity must begin with a very careful linguistic analysis of\ninvestigated problems and their meaning.\n\nTwardowski himself favoured descriptive psychology as basic, but many\nof his students found logic to be the most important source of\nmethodological criteria for philosophy. Perhaps \u0141ukasiewicz was\nthe most radical in this respect. According to him, a reform of\nphilosophy was needed in order to avoid errors of the past. Philosophy\nshould proceed as logic does, axiomatically starting from clear\nconcepts and evident principles. Other philosophers of the LWS were\nmore modest and did not demand that philosophy should be axiomatized.\nHowever, logical analysis of philosophical discourse became the\nstandard method of analysis. Yet the task of philosophy is not limited\nto the analysis of language. Thus, philosophy, according to\nmethodological claims of the LWS, was analytic but not purely\nlinguistic. Philosophy is concerned with the world but it mainly\n(though not \u2018only\u2019) performs its task also by the analysis\nof language, which is used in speaking about reality. This view about\nphilosophy is to be contrasted with that of the Vienna Circle. In\nparticular, the LWS was not interested in a general metaphilosophical\nscheme that sharply divided philosophy into good and bad, but rather\nwith an analysis of concrete problems. Thus, the LWS was united more\nby a common methodological attitude and very general claims concerning\nrationality than by a commonly accepted philosophical theory.\n\nHowever, some general views were shared by most (\u2018most\u2019 is\nvery important here) members of the LWS. These include:\nanti-scepticism, anti-naturalism in humanities and axiology, realism\nin epistemology and philosophy of science, absolutism in epistemology\nand axiology, and empiricism. These views were characteristic for\nBrentano and became implemented in Polish philosophy by\nTwardowski.\n3. Logic\n3.1 Polish notation, the requirements for logical systems and metalogical concepts\n\n\u0141ukasiewicz invented a parenthesis-free logical notation. The\nidea consisted in writing logical constants before their arguments.\n\u0141ukasiewicz replaced the usual signs for logical operations by\nletters: N (negation), K (conjunction), A\n(disjunction), C (implication) and E (equivalence).\nAny well-formed formula (the present explanations are restricted to\npropositional calculus) must begin with a capital letter\n(propositional variables are symbolized by lower-case Latin letters)\nwhich is the main functor of the entire formula. The main connective\nhas as its arguments variables or formulas consisting of variables and\nconstants. The following are examples: Cpp for (p\n\u2192 p), CCppNq for ((p \u2192\np) \u2192 \u00acq). The structure of a formula (and\nhence also its meaning) in Polish notation is uniquely determined by\nthe position of the letters. The parenthesis-free notation is\nunambiguous in the sense that any finite sequence of symbols for\nconnectives and variables is interpretable in a unique way. This\nimplies that any wff coded in Polish notation has only one translation\ninto the standard symbolism. The main advantage of Polish notation is\nits economy, because it avoids special punctuation devices such as\nbrackets or dots. When \u0141ukasiewicz met Turing in 1949, the latter\nremarked that Polish notation was much better for computers, because\nformulas with function-symbols in front could be better elaborated by\nmechanical devices.\n\nThe parenthesis-free symbolism was closely associated with some ideas\nof Polish logicians concerning the good properties of formal systems.\nOf course, any correct logical system should be consistent and, if\npossible, syntactically and semantically complete. It should also be\nbased on independent sets of primitive terms and axioms. The Warsaw\nSchool of Logic strongly emphasized the last property, often\nconsidered secondary. Thus, the dependence of primitive terms or\naxioms was regarded as an essential defect. Moreover, some additional\nstructural properties of logical systems were recommended: (a) a\nsystem with fewer primitive concepts is better; (b) a system with\nfewer axioms is better; (c) if we define the length of an axiom system\nas the number of symbols occurring in all of its axioms, the shortest\naxiom system is the best; (d) a system with fewer different symbols is\nbetter; (e) if we define an organic theorem as one which has no other\ntheorem inside it (for example, the formula CpCqq is not an\norganic theorem), organic axioms are better than non-organic ones.\nThus, the ideal axiom system consists of a sole organic axiom of the\nshortest possible length, provided that it is consistent. Requirements\n(a)-(f) apply particularly well to propositional calculus. They became\nthe guiding principles of many logical investigations in the Warsaw\nSchool of Logic. Logicians of this school also made precise many\nimportant metalogical concepts, including those of the logical matrix,\nconsequence operation, deductive system and model.\n3.2 Investigations of classical propositional calculus\n\n\u0141ukasiewicz formulated several axiomatic bases for the\nfunctionally complete propositional calculus, that is PC in which all\n16 binary connectives can be defined. The most popular is the\nN-C system, having as axioms the formulas:\nCCpqCCqrCpr, CCNppp, CpCNpq, and the usual\nrules of inference (substitution, detachment). This system is\nconsistent, independent, Post-complete (= semantically complete):\n\u0141ukasiewicz and his collaborators invented new methods for\nproving these properties. According to the criteria mentioned in the\npreceding section, one should look for the simplest axiom bases.\n3.3 Many-valued, modal and intuitionistic logic\n\nThe discovery of many-valued logic is commonly considered to be one of\nthe major achievements of \u0141ukasiewicz. He did it in 1918, a\nlittle earlier than Post. However, although Post\u2019s remarks were\nparenthetical and extremely condensed, \u0141ukasiewicz explained his\nintuitions and motivations carefully and at length. He was guided by\nconsiderations about future contingents and the concept of\npossibility.\n\n\u0141ukasiewicz observed that no functor of classical propositional\ncalculus could be read as \u201cit is possible that\u201d and\nprovided that the formula Mp (it is possible that p)\nis extensional (i.e., that its value depends solely on the value of\np). The difficulty can be solved if we admit a third value.\nSentences about future contingent states of affairs are natural\ncandidates for having the third value (\u00bd). For example, the\nsentence \u201cI will visit Warszawa next year\u201d, is neither\ntrue nor false, it is merely possible and has the value \u00bd. Its\nnegation has the same value. This idea led to three-valued logic. The\nusual equalities for N, A, Kand C\nare supplemented by (I list only some cases) p = \u00bd =\nNp, K \u00bd\u00bd = \u00bd,\nA\u00bd\u00bd = \u00bd. Easy calculations shows that\nApNp and NKpNp have the value \u00bd for\np = \u00bd. This means that the laws of contradiction and\nexcluded middle do not hold in three-valued logic. Later,\n\u0141ukasiewicz generalized it to logics with an arbitrary finite\nnumber of values and finally to an countably infinite number of\nvalues. The sense of implication is given by the equations:\n\nCpq = 1, for p\u2264q\n\nCpq = 1\u2212(p + q), for p>q,\n\n\nand the sense of negation by the equation:\n\nNp = 1\u2212p, where 0\u2264p\u22641.\n\n\nIf we have only two values, these equations determine the usual\ntruth-tables for C and N.\n\nThree problems arose after discovering many-valued logic. The first\nconcerned its axiomatization and metalogical properties, the second\nits philosophical foundations and intuitive interpretation, and the\nthird its applications. Due to the work of \u0141ukasiewicz himself,\nWajsberg and S\u0142upecki, the first group of questions was largely\nsolved. Wajsberg showed that the formulas: CpCqp,\nCCpqCCqrCpr, CCNpNqCqp, CCCpNppp axiomatize\n\u01413 (three-valued propositional calculus). The same\nauthor proved that a finite \u0141n is axiomatizable if it\nincludes the theorems: CCpqCCqrCpr, CCCqrCCpqCpr,\nCCqqCpp, CCpqCNqNp, CNqCCpqNq. If\nn = \u21350, \u0141n can be\naxiomatized by (\u0141ukasiewicz\u2019s conjecture, proved by\nWajsberg): CpCqp, CCpqCCqrCpr,\nCCCpqqqCCqpp, CCCpqCqpCqp, CCNpNqCqp.\nHowever, all of the above axiom-sets are functionally incomplete. The\nproblem was solved by S\u0142upecki for \u01413. He\nintroduced the new functor T defined by T1 =\nT\u00bd = T0 = \u00bd and added the formulas\nCTpNTp, CNTpTp to Wajsberg\u2019s axioms. All\n\u0141ukasiewicz\u2019s many-valued logics are consistent.\nS\u0142upecki proved that \u01413 is Post-complete. Every\n\u0141n (n>2) is contained in two-valued logic,\nalthough the converse does not hold; for example, the formulas\nCCNpNp, CCNppp, CCpqCCpNqNp,\nCCpKNqNp, CcpEqNqNq are theorems in the two-valued\nsystem only. If n = \u21350, \u0141n\nis contained in every finite \u0141n.\n\nAt first, \u0141ukasiewicz called his three-valued logic\n\u201cNon-Aristotelian\u201d, but later he preferred the\nqualification \u201cNon-Chrysippean\u201d. According to\n\u0141ukasiewicz, the Stagirite himself doubted the validity of the\nprinciple of excluded middle in the domain of future contingents. On\nthe other hand, the Stoics believed that every proposition is true or\nfalse, independently of its temporal reference. Thus, the Stoics\naccepted the principle of bivalence in its unrestricted form. Now, the\nfoundation of two or many-valued logic lies not in this or that\nlogical theorem, but in metalogic; in particular, it is determined by\naccepting or rejecting the principle of bivalence. Whoever, as\nChrisippus did, accepts the validity of the principle of bivalence,\nopts for two-valued logic; whoever even partially rejects this\nprinciple, as Aristotle did, thereby opens the door to many-valued\nlogic. \u0141ukasiewicz took the side of Aristotle. However, this did\nnot close the problem of the interpretation of other logical values.\n\u0141ukasiewicz tried to go though indeterminism and causality. A\ntypical difficulty is the following. Take p as valued by\n\u00bd. Its negation also has the value \u00bd. The same holds for\nKpNp, contrary to the firm intuition that any pair of\ncontradictory sentences is false. Difficulties with interpretation\nchanged \u0141ukasiewicz\u2019s primary view concerning the relation\nof many-valued logic to reality. At first, guided by a realistic\nepistemology of logic, he maintained that one of the rival logics\ncould be proved to be the correct description of the physical world.\nLater, he was rather inclined to look at logical systems as formalisms\nhaving their own problems deserving research and as useful devices for\nsolving various questions but not as something leading to the only\n\u201ctrue\u201d ontological scheme. Yet he believed that\nmany-valued logic would play a considerable role in the foundations of\nmathematics.\n3.3.1 Le\u015bniewski\u2019s systems\n\nLe\u015bniewski intended to a formulate the full logical system that\nwould serve as the basis for the whole of science, and in particular\nfor mathematics. This system consists of three parts (a) protothetic\n(a generalized propositional calculus); (b) ontology (a logic of\nterms); (c) mereology (a theory of parts and wholes). Protothetic is a\ncalculus in which quantifiers bind propositional variables and\nvariables referr to arbitrary functors constructible over the usual\nfunctors: that is, functors of propositional variables, functors of\nfunctors, etc. In general, if we start with the category of sentences\nalone, protothetical quantifiers bind variables of all further\ndefinable categories. The shortest axiom of protothetic (written in\nthe Russell-like symbolism) is the formula\n\n[pq] :: p \u2194 . q \u2194\n:.[f]:. f (pf (p [u].\nu)). \u2194 : [r]: f (qr). \u2194\n. q \u2194 p\n\n\n(Soboci\u0144ski). Protothetic is an absolute propositional calculus\nin the sense that the principle of bivalence is its theorem. In fact,\nprotothetic inspired \u0141ukasiewicz\u2019s system with variable\nfunctors, another absolute propositional logic.\n\nIf we add the functor \u03b5 (read as \u201cis\u201d) forming\nsentences from two names, we obtain Le\u015bniewski\u2019s ontology\n(LO). The meaning of the constant \u03b5 is perhaps the most\nimportant matter for a proper understanding of LO. The epsilon\ncorresponds well to the sense of the copula \u201cest\u201d\nin Latin sentences of the type \u201cSocrates est\nhomo\u201d. The epsilon has no spatio-temporal connotations and\ndoes not indicate the membership relation or identity. The rendering\nof the epsilon by the English \u201cis\u201d may be misleading,\nbecause the latter is modified by articles. The axiomatic\ncharacterization of the meaning of the epsilon is given by\n\n(O)\n[Aa]:: (A \u03b5 a) \u2194\n:.[\u03a3B]. (B \u03b5 a):.\n[BC]: (B \u03b5 A). (C\n\u03b5 A). \u2192\n\n(B \u03b5 C):. [B]: (B\n\u03b5 A) \u2192. B \u03b5 a.\n\n\nIts simplified form (discovered by Soboci\u0144ski) is:\n\n(O\u2032)\n[Aa] A \u03b5a:\n\u2194.[\u03a3B]. (A \u03b5B).\n(B \u03b5a).\n\n\nThe right sides of (O) and (O\u2032) are conjunctions. The intuitive\ncontent of (O) is simple in spite of its formal complexity. It\nestablishes that the sentence \u201cA is a\u201d\nis equivalent to the following conditions (a) A is not an\nempty term; (b) there is only one A; (c) whatever is\nA, is also a. Thus, \u201cA is\na\u201d is a singular sentence which is true if and only if\n(a)-(c) hold. In particular, such a sentence is false if A is\na general or an empty term. On the other hand, (O) (or O\u2032) is\nvalid for all terms, even general or empty ones. Thus, LO is valid in\nall domains, including the empty one and can be regarded as the first\nsystem of free logic. In LO we can define two important concepts,\nnamely that of existence and that of being an object. This is done by\n(I use non-symbolic forms): (1) for any A, A exists\n= for some x, x is A; (2) for any\nA, A is an object = for some x, A\nis x. LO performs functions usually provided by predicate\nlogic. The meaning of the constant \u03b5 is sufficiently general\nto define identity and the inclusion of classes. Since these concepts\nare definable in elementary ontology, it is stronger than first-order\nlogic.\n\nMereology, assumes protothetic and ontology as logically prior\ntheories, and has the term \u201cpart of\u201d as its sole primitive\nconcept. Being a part is a non-reflexive and transitive relation.\nThere are no empty classes. Moreover, the class consisting of a single\nelement is identical with it. In general, mereology is a theory of\nsets in the collective (mereological) sense, contrary to ordinary set\ntheory, which describes sets in the distributive sense. The main\ndifference between the two interpretations of the term\n\u201cset\u201d consists in the fact that the membership relation is\ntransitive under the mereological reading, but non-transitive under\nthe distributive one. Le\u015bniewski believed that his theory classes\nwould perform all the tasks of ordinary set theory without generating\nparadoxes. In fact, he invented mereology when he tried to solved the\nRussell paradox. Since there are no mereological classes which are not\ntheir own elements, the question which led to the Russell paradox\nsimply makes no sense in Le\u015bniewski\u2019s systems. On the other\nhand, mereology is weaker than set theory.\n\nLe\u015bniewski\u2019s systems have some formal features, even very\npeculiar ones in some respects. All are axiomatic. According to his\nnominalistic preferences, they are concrete physical objects.\nExpressions are always understood as sequences of concrete\ninscriptions. There are as many expressions as have been written; no\nexpression exists merely potentially. This view is called constructive\nnominalism. According to it, two intuitively equivalent systems, for\nexample, protothetic based on equivalence and protothetic based on\nimplication, are different systems. Every logical system, on\nLe\u015bniewski\u2019s view, is not finished at any time because\nthere is always the possibility of adding new elements to it. Hence,\nthe rules for constructing and developing formal systems are of\ncrucial importance for Le\u015bniewski\u2019s logics. He understood\nthis very well and devoted much attention to explaining the details of\nhis formalization. Le\u015bniewski formulated his procedural\ndirectives purely syntactically and completely. Due to the role of\nequivalence, he was able to treat definitions as theorems. In general,\nLe\u015bniewski\u2019s systems are commonly considered to be perfect\nfrom the point of view of the requirements of correct formalization.\nThe Le\u015bniewski project is a version of logicism.\nLe\u015bniewski\u2019s three systems form a grand logic and provide a\nuniversal language to capture the whole of knowledge. It is certainly\nnot an orthodox system and lies on the margin of contemporary research\nin logic. Yet it continues to attract many logicians and philosophers.\nIn spite of their marginality, Le\u015bniewski\u2019s systems are\ninvestigated in all parts of the world.\n\nLe\u015bniewski suggested the theory of syntactic categories, later\ndeveloped by Ajdukiewicz in the early 1930s. This theory takes the\ncategories of sentences and names (for Ajdukiewicz, following\nLe\u015bniewski, there is no syntactic difference between proper names\nand common nouns) as fundamental and assigns the pointer s to\nsentences and n to names. Now functors have fractions as\npointers. For example, \u201cis\u201d has s/nn as its\ncategorial index; it says that \u201cis\u201d is a two-placed\nfunctor of two nominal arguments which forms a sentence. The\nconjunction as a propositional connective forming sentences from two\nother sentences has s/ss as its index. Consider now\nthe expression \u201cp and q\u201d. Write the\ncategorial indexes of its parts. We thus obtain the sequence:\ns s/ss s. Perform simplifications\nby divisions similar to dividing algebraic fractions. The letter\ns is the result. A simple algorithm says that an expression\nis syntactically coherent if and only if s or n is\nits index after performing all simplifications. Ajdukiewicz\u2019s\nquasi-arithmetical notation was the first system of categorial\ngrammar.\n3.4 Semantics and truth\n\nDue to semantic paradoxes, Hilbert\u2019s formalistic metamathematics\nand the syntacticism of the Vienna Circle, the concept of truth was\nexpelled from the domain of logic. It was Tarski who changed this\nattitude. He was inspired by the Aristotelian tradition in philosophy,\nas well as the non-constructive style of working on the foundations of\nmathematics that was prevailed in Poland. In 1933, he published a book\non the concept of truth (in Polish), translated into German in 1936\nand English in 1956.\n\nTarski\u2019s theory of truth (the semantic conception of truth) has\ntwo aspects: philosophical and formal. Philosophically, it is a\nversion of Aristotle\u2019s idea that truth consists in saying that\nwhat is, is and what is not, is not (it is related to the idea of\ncorrespondence). However, the main problem was formal. Tarski had to\noffer a construction free of semantic paradoxes, in particular the\nLiar. He achieved this goal by postulating that the concept of truth\nmust be defined for a definite, well-constructed formalized language\nL. However, the definition itself should be\nformulated in the metalanguage ML. The definition is\nto be formally correct, that is, it cannot lead to contradictions and\nhas to satisfy the usual conditions of correctness (non-circularity,\netc.). It should also be materially adequate. According to Tarski, the\nbasic intuition is captured by the T-scheme: s is true if and\nonly if P, where the letter s represents the name of\na sentence and P is a translation of this sentence into the\nmetalanguage ML. Now the condition of material\nadequacy (the Convention T) says that a truth definition\nTD is materially adequate if and only if all\nequivalences (that is, for all sentences in L)\nstemming from the T-scheme by appropriate replacements are\nprovable from the definition. The conditions are satisfied by the\nfollowing definition:\n\nA sentence A of a language L is true if and\nonly if it is satisfied by all infinite sequences of objects taken\nfrom the universe of discourse.\n\n\nA more refined version is model-theoretical:\n\nA sentence A is true in a model M if and\nonly if A is satisfied by all infinite sequences of objects\ntaken from the carrier of M.\n\n\nThis definition implies the metalogical principles of excluded middle\nand contradiction, which both are equivalent to the principle of\nbivalence.\n\nTarski\u2019s truth-definition is one of the most debated\ncontemporary philosophical and logical ideas. It strongly influenced\nsemantics, philosophy of language, philosophy of science and\nepistemology. In particular, it became the first step toward\nmodel-theory, a central branch of mathematical logic. Two applications\nof this definition are worth mentioning. Firstly, Tarski succeeded in\nformulating an exact definition of \u201clogical consequence\u201d\n(\u201cfollowing from\u201d or \u201clogical\nentailment\u201d):\n\nA sentence A logically follows from the set\nX of sentences if and only if every model of\nX is a model of A.\n\n\nSecondly, Tarski proved the following limitative theorem:\n\nIf a formal system S captures Peano arithmetic, the\ntruth-predicate (or: the set of S-truth) is not\ndefinable in it.\n\n3.5 The history of logic\n\n\u0141ukasiewicz revolutionized the history of logic. He proposed to\nlook at the history of logical ideas through the glasses of\nmathematical logic. The reason was that he was convinced about the\ncontinuity of formal logic from Aristotle to modern mathematical\nlogic, perhaps with a break from the 16th century to Boole\nand Frege (of course, with the exception of Leibniz). Thus, old sound\nlogical theories should be considered as anticipations of ideas\nadvanced in the 19th and the 20th centuries.\nGuided by this assumption, \u0141ukasiewicz showed that the Stoics\ninvented propositional calculus, contrary to the prevailing view that\nStoic logic was a part of Aristotle\u2019s logic. In particular,\n\u0141ukasiewicz demonstrated that the Stoic logic of propositions was\na system of rules, not theorems. Another of \u0141ukasiewicz\u2019s\nhistorical discoveries consisted in the rehabilitation of medieval\nlogic, commonly neglected as fruitless scholasticism. He was joined in\nthese investigations by Boche\u0144ski and Salamucha.\n\nHistorical work inspired logicians of the LWS toward modern\ninterpretations of traditional logical doctrines. The most famous is\n\u0141ukasiewicz\u2019s formalization of the Aristotelian logic of\ncategorical sentences (the syllogistic plus conversion and other rules\nof so-called direct inference). \u0141ukasiewicz interpreted this\nlogic as a specific formal theory, not as a fragment of predicate\nlogic, as it was usually done (for example by Frege or Russell). Yet\nthe logic of categorical sentences assumes propositional logic as\nprior. The logic of assertoric sentences (\u0141ukasiewicz also\nconsidered its modal extension) has the following form. Let the\nformulas (lower-case letters are term variables) Uab,\nIab, Yab, Oab stand for the sentences\n\u201cevery a is b\u201d, \u201csome a\nare b\u201d, \u201cno a is b\u201d and\n\u201csome a are not b\u201d. We can define\nYab as NIab and Oab as NUab. The\naxioms are as follows: (a) Uaa; (b) Iaa; (c)\nCKUmbUamUab (the Barbara modus); (d) CKUmbImaIab\n(the Datisi mode); the rules are: all the rules of propositional\ncalculus, substitution for term variables, the definitional\nreplacement according to the definitions of Yab and\nOab.\n3.6 The philosophy of logic and mathematics\n\nThere was no official philosophy of logic and mathematics in the LWS.\nMost Polish logicians treated logical studies as independent of\nphilosophical commitments. Only Le\u015bniewski had explicit\nphilosophical views which influenced the form of his systems. This\ndoes not mean that concrete works were not influenced by philosophical\nideas. \u0141ukasiewicz\u2019s many-valued logic and Tarski\u2019s\ntheory of truth are perhaps model cases. The former had the problem of\ndeterminism as its background and the second was strongly inspired by\nthe Aristotelian tradition in thinking about truth. It was also the\ncase that Polish logicians had inclinations to empiricism as a general\nepistemological attitude and this philosophy often resulted in\nsympathies to nominalism (Tarski), constructivism (Mostowski) and\nscepticism concerning the sharp distinction between logical and\nextralogical truth (Tarski). However, the technical side of logical\nproblems decided about investigations and sometimes forced changes in\nphilosophical standpoints. The example of \u0141ukasiewicz is\ninstructive once again. Although he at first thought of logic as a\ntrue or false description of reality, he later adopted a more\nconventionalist and instrumentalistic standpoint. This attitude\nallowed him to accommodate various ideas coming from rival\nfoundational directions, that is, logicism, formalism and\nintuitionism. In fact, Le\u015bniewski and Tarski contributed to the\ntheory of logical types and combined it with the theory of syntactic\ncategories; Tarski\u2019s version in his work on truth is\nparticularly important. Tarski also showed new perspectives for\nlogicism by defining logical concepts as invariants under one-to-one\ntransformations. He also contributed to general metamathematics (the\ntheory of consequence operation) and intuitionistic logic. However, a\nvery special feature of logical investigations performed in the LWS\nconsisted in the free admission of all fruitful mathematical methods,\nincluding non-constructive ones. This was the main point of the set\ntheoretical approach to the foundations of mathematics which replaced\nlogicism.\n3.7 Supplementary and concluding remarks\n\nThe above survey does not do justice to many of the logical studies\ncarried out in the LWS. Let me only mention some of them: particular\nhistorical studies of Boche\u0144ski and Salamucha, several\ninterpretations of traditional logic (Ajdukiewicz, Cze\u017cowski),\npartial propositional calculi (all Warsaw logicians), propositional\ncalculus with variable functors (\u0141ukasiewicz), paraconsistency\n(Ja\u015bkowski), \u0141-modal systems (\u0141ukasiewicz), rejection\nrules, natural deduction (Ja\u015bkowski), intuitionistic logic\n(Ja\u015bkowski, Tarski, Wajsberg), free logic (Ja\u015bkowski,\nMostowski), the elimination of quantifiers (Tarski, Presburger),\nundecidability (Tarski, Mostowski), the foundations of geometry\n(Tarski), the elementary theory of real numbers, the calculus of\nsystems (Tarski), the Kleene-Mostowski hierarchy, generalized\nquantifiers (Mostowski), as well as several particular results: the\ndeduction theorem (Tarski), the upward L\u00f6wenheim-Skolem theorem\n(Tarski), the separation theorem for intuitionistic logic (Wajsberg)\nor the Lindenbaum maximalization lemma.\n4. Philosophy of Science\n\nThe philosophy of science was a favourite field of the LWS. Since\nscience is the most rational human activity, it was important to\nexplain its rationality and unity. Since most philosophers of the LWS\nrejected naturalism in the humanities and social sciences, the way\nthrough the unity of language (as in the case of the Vienna Circle)\nwas excluded. The answer was simple: science qua science is rational\nand is unified by its logical structure and by definite logical tools\nused in scientific justifications. Thus, the analysis of the\ninferential machinery of science is the most fundamental task of\nphilosophers science. Inductivism was a prevailing view about\njustification in empirical science. Hosiasson formulated an axiomatic\nsystem of inductive logic, anticipating Carnap\u2019s later work.\nOther attempts to establish the foundations of inductive inference\nwere undertaken by Ajdukiewicz (via statistics, decision theory and\ngame theory (he mainly investigated the problem of the rationality of\nmodes of fallible inference), Cze\u017cowski (via probability logic in\nthe sense of Reichenbach) and Zawirski (via a combination of\nmany-valued logic and probability theory).\n\n\u0141ukasiewicz worked on problems of the methodology of the\nempirical sciences in 1902\u20131910. At first, he tried to develop\nthe inverse theory of induction (induction as inversed deduction)\nproposed by Jevons and Sigwart. However, he abandoned this project\nvery soon and adopted a radical deductionist standpoint. For him,\ninduction plays no significant role in science. Deduction remains the\nonly credible mode of reasoning in all spheres of science. As applied\nin empirical science, it leads to negative results; that is, it can\nshow that some hypotheses are false in the face of empirical data.\n\u0141ukasiewicz also offered a formal argument against induction\nderived from probability theory. Assume that H is a universal\nhypothesis. Its a priori probability is equal (or close) to zero and\nno further empirical data can increase it. These ideas contain the\nmain points of Popper\u2019s philosophy of empirical science.\n\nTarski\u2019s semantic ideas converted most members of the LWS to\nscientific realism. Formerly, under the influence of conventionalism,\ninstrumentalism concerning scientific theories had adherents\n(Ajdukiewicz, \u0141ukasiewicz). A radical form of anti-realism was\ndeveloped by Pozna\u0144ski and Wundheiler in the 1930s. They pointed\nout that verification in empirical science is cyclic and principally\nanti-fundamentalistic. In particular, it is not possible to identify\nany data without a reference to theories. Hence, truth in science\ncannot consist in a correspondence with facts.\n\nOf many investigations concerning special problems, let me only\nmention Mehlberg\u2019s version of the causal theory of time and some\nworks on the causality problem in quantum mechanics. He admitted a\nuniversal time as a synthesis of physical (intersubjective) and\npsychical (subjective) time. The causal theory does not lead to the\nanisotropy of time. It can be that universal time is symmetric, but\nlocally asymmetry is possible. Mehlberg and Zawirski defended a\nmoderate causalism in quantum mechanics. In particular, Zawirski\nargued that the unpredictability of the future (Heisenberg) does not\nentail that the principle of causality fails.\n5. Ontology and Epistemology Inspired by Logic\n5.1 Reism\n\nKotarbi\u0144ski developed a general doctrine, called reism. It has\ntwo aspects, ontological and semantic. Hence, we can speak about\nsemantic reism and ontological reism, although this distinction was\nclarified by Kotarbi\u0144ski later. In general, reism goes against\nthe acceptance of the existence of general (abstract) objects, that\nis, facts, properties, states of affairs, relations, etc. The main\nontological thesis of reism is as follows (it is subdivided into two\nsubtheses): (R1) any object is a material, spatio-temporal, concrete\nthing; (R2) no object is a state of affairs, property of relation\n(according to Kotarbi\u0144ski, these three categories exhaust the\ndomain of alleged abstract objects). Now (R1), that is, the positive\nthesis of reism has a rich content. Firstly, it marks a formal feature\nof existing objects, namely their concrete character.\n\nSecondly, it characterizes things as material and spatio-temporal\nentities, that is, as physical objects. Leibniz conceived monads as\nspiritual concreta. For the later Brentano, every object is concrete,\nbut there are souls and bodies. Thus, Leibniz\u2019s reism was\nmonistic and spiritualistic, Brentano\u2019s was dualistic, and\nKotarbi\u0144ski\u2019s monistic and materialistic. Although the\nterminology varies (one can equivalently speak about reism, concretism\nor nominalism), two claims of any theory going against general\n(abstract) objects should be very sharply distinguished. The first is\nformal-ontological and points out the formal feature of existents,\nnamely that they are individuals; but the second is\nmaterial-ontological or metaphysical and focuses on their nature as\nphysical or psychical entities.\n\nSemantic reism is parallel to the ontological aspect of this doctrine.\nThe key idea consists in the distinction of genuine names and apparent\nnames (onomatoids). A name is genuine if and only if refers to things,\nthat is, to concrete physical things. By contrast, onomatoids are\nwords that allegedly refer to abstract entities,\n\u201callegedly\u201d because their referents do not exist. At first\nglance, apparent names are similar to empty terms. However, this\nresemblance is merely apparent, because empty nouns are genuine names\nand can always be decomposed into non-empty genuine names (e.g.,\n\u201cround square\u201d). This becomes evident when we try to\nformulate the conditions of meaningfulness for sentences. In general,\na sentence is meaningful if and only if it consists (except for\nlogical constants) only of genuine names or is reducible to such\nsentences. For example, the sentence \u201call cats are\nanimals\u201d is reistically meaningful, but \u201cproperties are\nabstract objects\u201d is not. Furthermore, \u201ca square triangle\nis rectangular\u201d is good, but \u201csets exist outside of time\nand space\u201d is not. The sentence \u201cwhiteness is a property\nof snow\u201d can be reduced to \u201csnow is white\u201d. This\nexample shows how to translate some sentences with apparent names into\npurely reistic statements.\n\nMatters become clearer if one remembers that Le\u015bniewski\u2019s\ncalculus of names is the underlying logic of reism. The copula\n\u201cis\u201d in \u201csnow is white\u201d functions with its\nmeaning defined by the axiom of LO (see above). Thus, this sentence is\ntrue if its subject refers to an individual object. The traditional\ninterpretation of common nouns and adjectives, consistent with LO, as\ngeneral terms referring to many objects, saves their reistic\ncharacter. Thus, one can say that the formal-ontological aspect of\nreism is adequately displayed by LO. Of course, reism as a\nmetaphysical doctrine is an addition to LO.\n\nKotarbi\u0144ski recommended reism as a sound view. In particular, it\ndefends philosophy and ordinary thinking before hypostases, that is,\naccepting the existence of abstract objects on the basis of using\napparent names. Thus, reism defends us against idola fori in\nBacon\u2019s sense. Kotarbi\u0144ski\u2019s reism is perhaps the\nmost radical materialistic nominalism in the history of philosophy.\nReism is exceptional to the main tendency in the LWS in that it\nproposes a uniform language, proper everywhere, including the\nhumanities, sociology and psychology (Kotarbi\u0144ski supplemented\nreism by radical realism, that is, the view that there are no mental\ncontents). In this respect, reism resembles physicalism. The troubles\nof reism are typical those which are in the case of any reductive\nmaterialism and nominalism, and concern the interpretation of\nmathematics, semantics, psychology, the humanities and social\nsciences.\n5.2 Radical conventionalism and semantic epistemology\n\nRadical conventionalism is an epistemological theory developed by\nAjdukiewicz in the early 1930s. It is based on a conception of\nlanguage and meaning. The concept of meaning is taken as a primitive.\nNow, the meaning of expressions in a language L\ninduces the rules for accepting its sentences. Ajdukiewicz lists three\nkinds of meaning-rules (or sense-rules): (a) axiomatic (they demand\nthe unconditional acceptance of sentences, for example,\n\u201cA is A\u201d; (b) deductive (they demand the\nacceptance of a sentence relatively to the prior acceptance of other\nsentences, for example, \u00acA follows from A \u2192\nB and \u00acB), (c) empirical (they demand the\nacceptance of a sentence in a definite empirical situation, for\nexample \u201cit is raining\u201d when it rains).\n\nThe special significance of meaning-rules and their relation to the\nmeanings of expressions appears when special languages are taken into\naccount, namely closed and connected. A language L is\nopen if it can be extended to a new language L\u2032\nwithout changes in the meanings of other expressions; otherwise\nL is closed. A language is disconnected if there is a\nnon-empty subset X of L such that no\nelement of X is linked by the meaning-rules to other\nelements of L; otherwise, L is\nconnected. It follows from the above definitions that if\nL is closed and connected, it cannot be enriched\nwithout changing the meanings of the original expressions.\n\nAccording to Ajdukiewicz, natural languages are open and disconnected.\nBy contrast, scientific languages are closed and disconnected. Let\nL be closed and connected. The set of meanings of\nL is its conceptual apparatus. If A\nand A\u2032 are two conceptual apparatuses, they are\neither identical or mutually non-translatable. Since the acceptance\nand rejection of sentences is always related to a language\nL, empirical data do no force us to accept or reject\nany sentences, because there always remains the possibility of\nchanging a given conceptual apparatus. This is a considerable\nradicalization of the conventionalism of Poincar\u00e9. The\ndifference is the following. For Poincar\u00e9, since theoretical\nprinciples are conventions, we are free to modify them, but\nexperiential reports are perfectly stable. Ajdukiewicz extended\nconventionalism to all sentences, because any sentence, no matter\nwhether experiential or theoretical, depends on a conceptual\napparatus. It is why Ajdukiewicz called this conventionalism\nradical.\n\nIn the middle of the 1930s Ajdukiewicz changed his view. He came to\nthe conclusion that closed and connected languages are fictions. He\nwas influenced by the semantic ideas of Tarski. Tarski also argued\nthat, contrary to Ajdukiewicz\u2019s hopes, the invariance of\nmeaning-rules over permutations of expressions influences their\nmeaning-relations. Gradually, Ajdukiewicz developed the program of\nsemantic epistemology, mainly directed toward the defence of realism\nagainst various forms of idealism. In particular, he criticized\nRickert\u2019s transcendental idealism and Berkeley\u2019s\nsubjectivism. For Rickert, reality is only a correlate of the\nTranscendental Subject. Now the Transcendental Subject can be\nidentified with the set T of true propositions\nobtainable on the basis of axiomatic and deductive rules. However, due\nto incompleteness phenomena, T cannot be generated in\nthis way. For Ajdukiewicz, that was a justification that\ntranscendental idealism fails. Ajdukiewicz compared the language used\nby Berkeley to the language of syntax, because the former reduces\nrelations of the mind to its objects to relations between thoughts. On\nthe other hand, the ordinary way of speaking about objects employs\nsemantic relations. Berkeley\u2019s claim esse =\npercipi is similar to an attempt to define semantics in a\npurely syntactic language. However, due to Tarski\u2019s results\nabout the relation between syntax and semantics, this is impossible.\nFinally, Ajdukiewicz argued that any idealistic language is\nunderstandable only if it is associated with a realistic language.\nHence, any attempt to consider idealistic language as self-sufficient\ncannot be successful.\n6. The Significance of the Lvov-Warsaw School\n\nThe LWS acted in a country which never belonged to the philosophical\nsuperpowers. This circumstance is important for any assessment of the\nsignificance of the LWS. One can measure it on a national or an\ninternational scale. The importance of the LWS for Polish\nphilosophical culture was enormous. Twardowski fully realized his\ntask. He introduced scientific philosophy in his sense into Poland and\ncreated a powerful philosophical school. It did very much for the\nsubsequent development of philosophy in the country. In particular, it\npopularized very high standards of doing philosophy. This was\nimportant in the difficult times after 1945, when Marxism started an\nideological and political offensive against bourgeois philosophy. In\nfact, due to the strong methodological tradition related to the LWS,\nPolish philosophy did not lose its academic quality in\n1945\u20131989.\n\nAs far as the matter concerns international importance, one thing is\nclear. The logical achievements of the LWS became the most famous.\nDoubtless, the Warsaw school of logic contributed very much to the\ndevelopment of logic in the 20th century. Other\ncontributions are known but rather marginally. This is partially due\nto the fact that most philosophical writings of the LWS appeared in\nPolish. However, this factor does not explain everything. Many\nwritings of the LWS were originally published in English, French or\nGerman. However, their influence was very moderate, considerably\nlesser than that of similar writings of philosophers from the leading\ncountries. This is a pity, because radical conventionalism, reism or\nsemantic epistemology are the real philosophical pearls. But perhaps\nthis is the fate of results achieved in cultural provinces.\n",
