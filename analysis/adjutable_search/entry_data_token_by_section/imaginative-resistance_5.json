    "main_text": "Resistance || The Object of Resistance\n2.2 The Object of Resistance\n\nAnother point of contention within imaginative resistance research\nconcerns the object of resistance. What is involved in our resisting\nto engage with a fictional work? So far we have seen various accounts\nthat attempt to give explanations of imaginative resistance while\nassuming that what is resisted is propositional content. There are\nother options. According to Moran (1994), our engagement with works of\nfiction cannot be reduced merely to imagining propositional contents\nbut also includes interpretive and emotional responses to fiction. In\npoint of fact, the content of our engagement is largely\nnon-propositional. He rejects the clear-cut distinction between the\nactual and the fictional and claims that our interpretative and\nemotional responses to fiction are actual rather than imagined. Moran\ndistinguishes between hypothetical and dramatic imagination (1994:\n104\u20135). Hypothetical imagining involves seeing what would follow\nfrom a propositional content you are given, entertaining the\nassumption of its truth. Dramatic imagining or imagining with respect\nto emotional attitudes involves trying on a perspective, a dramatic\nrehearsal so to speak. The phenomenon of imaginative resistance\ninvolves both kinds of imagining. A resistance triggering scenario\nwould do so because (1) we have difficulties entertaining the\nassumption of its truth because the storyline does not add up and (2)\nwe have difficulties inhabiting the perspective because it is alien to\nus. \n\nOne of the problems with Moran\u2019s account is that it is not clear\nhow we can account for what Elizabeth Camp (2017) calls\n\u201cdisparate response\u201d. Disparate response refers to \n\n\nreaders\u2019 ability and willingness to alter their emotional, moral\nand other evaluative responses from those they would have to the same\nsituation in real life. (2017: 73) \n\n\nSince Moran challenges the strict actual/fictional divide, he seems to\nrun into a problem when it comes to explaining disparate response.\nCamp (2017), drawing on Moran\u2019s work, presents a unified\nexplanation of both imaginative resistance and disparate responses by\nappealing to perspectives. She defines perspective as \n\n\nan open-ended disposition to notice, explain, and respond to\nsituations in the world \u2014 an ability to \u201cgo on the same\nway\u201d in assimilating and responding to whatever information and\nexperiences one encounters. (2017: 78) \n\n\nEngaging with works of fiction involves taking on perspectives that\nare prescribed by the narrators. That is how non-propositional content\nis communicated to audiences. In cases of imaginative resistance, what\nwe resist is taking on alien perspectives. Our resistance might be\ncaused by various types of inconsistencies embedded in the work or we\nmight resist on prudential, moral, or aesthetic grounds. One important\naspect of Camp\u2019s theory is that these resistance reactions are\nnot always voluntary (2017: 92\u20133). She also argues that her\naccount has an advantage over competing theories because she does not\nreduce the content of imaginings to propositional content. (See also\nGoldie 2003, for a similar explanation of imaginative resistance.)\n",
