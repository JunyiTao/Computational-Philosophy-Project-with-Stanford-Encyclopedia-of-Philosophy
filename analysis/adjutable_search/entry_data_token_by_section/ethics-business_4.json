Conversely, justifications\nfor why the firm should be managed in the interests of P sometimes\nappeal P\u2019s rights to control it.\n\nFriedman (1970), for example, thinks that shareholders\u2019\nownership of the firm gives them a right to control the firm (which\nthey can use to ensure that the firm is run in their interests). We\nmight see control rights for shareholders as following analytically\nfrom the concept of ownership. To own a thing is to have a bundle of\nrights with respect to that thing. One of the standard\n\u201cincidents\u201d of ownership is control. (See the entry on\n property and ownership.)\n\nAs noted, in recent years the idea that the firm is something that can\nbe owned has been challenged (Bainbridge 2008; Stout 2012; Strudler\n2017). If this is right, then the ownership argument collapses. But\nsimilar contractarian arguments for shareholder control of firms have\nbeen constructed which do not rely on the assumption of firm\nownership. All that is assumed in these arguments is that some people\nown capital, and others own labor. Capital can \u201chire\u201d\nlabor (and other inputs of production) or labor can \u201chire\u201d\ncapital. It just so happens that, in most cases, capital hires labor.\nWe know this because in most cases capital-providers are the ultimate\ndecision-makers in the firm. In a publicly-traded corporation, they\nelect the board. These points are emphasized especially by those who\nregard the firm as a \u201cnexus of contracts\u201d among various\nparties (Easterbrook & Fischel 1996; Jensen & Meckling\n1976).\n\nMany writers find this result troubling. Even if the governance\nstructure in most firms is in some sense agreed to, they say that it\nis unjust in other ways. Anderson (2017) characterizes standard\ncorporate governance regimes as oppressive and unaccountable private\ndictatorships. To address this injustice, these writers call for\nvarious forms of worker participation in managerial decision-making,\nincluding the ability by workers to reject arbitrary directives by\nmanagers (Hsieh 2005), worker co-determination of firms\u2019\npolicies and practices (Ferreras 2017; McMahon 1994), and exclusive\ncontrol of productive enterprises by workers (Dahl 1985).\n\nArguments for these governance structures take various forms. One\nappeals to the value of protecting workers\u2019 interests\n(Gonz\u00e1lez-Ricoy 2014; Hsieh 2005). Another appeals to the value\nof autonomy, or a right to freely determine one\u2019s actions,\nincluding one\u2019s actions at work (Malleson 2014; McCall 2001). A\nthird argument for worker control is the \u201cparallel case\u201d\nargument. According to it, if states should be governed\ndemocratically, then so should firms, because firms are like states in\nthe relevant respects (Dahl 1985; Landemore & Ferreras 2016; cf.\nMayer 2000). A fourth argument sees worker participation in firm\ndecision-making as valuable training for citizens in a democratic\nsociety (Pateman 1970).\n\nSpace considerations prevent detailed examinations of these arguments\n(for critical reviews see Frega, Herzog, & Neuh\u00e4user 2019;\nHsieh 2008). But criticisms generally fall into two categories. The\nfirst insists on the normative priority of agreements, of the sort\ndescribed above. There are few legal restrictions on the types of\ngovernance structures that firms can have. And some firms are in fact\ncontrolled by workers (Dow 2003; Hansmann 1996). To insist that other\nfirms should be governed this way is to say, according to this\nargument, that people should not be allowed to arrange their economic\nlives as they see fit. Another criticism of worker participation\nappeals to efficiency. Allowing workers to participate in managerial\ndecision-making may decrease the pace of decision-making, since it\nrequires giving many workers a chance to make their voices heard\n(Hansmann 1996). It may also raise the cost of capital for firms, as\ninvestors may demand more favorable terms if they are not given\ncontrol of the enterprise in return (McMahon 1994). Both sources of\ninefficiency may put the firm at a significant disadvantage in a\ncompetitive market. It may not just be a matter of competitive\ndisadvantage. If it were, the problem could be solved by making all\nfirms worker-controlled. The problem may be one of diminished\nproductivity more generally.\n",
