    "main_text": "Archytas and the Sciences || Optics and Mechanics\n3.3 Optics and Mechanics\n\nAristotle is the first Greek author to mention the sciences of optics\nand mechanics, describing optics as a subordinate science to geometry\nand mechanics as a subordinate science to solid geometry\n(APo. 78b34). Archytas does not mention either of these\nsciences in B1, when describing the work of his predecessors in the\nsciences, nor does Plato mention them. This silence suggests that the\ntwo disciplines may have first developed in the first half of the\nfourth century, when Archytas was most active, and it is possible that\nhe played an important role in the development of both of them. In a\nrecently identified fragment from his book on the Pythagoreans\n(Iamblichus, Comm. Math. XXV; see Burkert 1972a, 50 n. 112),\nAristotle assigns a hitherto unrecognized importance to optics in\nPythagoreanism. Just as the Pythagoreans were impressed with the fact\nthat musical intervals were based on whole number ratios, so they were\nimpressed that the phenomena of optics could be explained in terms of\ngeometrical diagrams. In addition to being an accomplished\nmathematician, Archytas had a theory of vision and evidently tried to\nexplain some of the phenomena involved in mirrors. In contrast to\nPlato, who argued that the visual ray, which proceeded from the eye,\nrequires the support of and coalesces with external light, Archytas\nexplained vision in terms of the visual ray alone (A25). It is\ntempting, then, to suppose that Archytas played a major role in the\ndevelopment of the mathematically based Pythagorean optics, to which\nAristotle refers. On the other hand, when Aristotle refers to\nPythagoreans, he generally means Pythagoreans of the fifth century.\nElsewhere he treats Archytas independently of the Pythagorean\ntradition, writing works on Archytas which were distinct from his work\non the Pythagoreans. It would thus be more natural to read\nAristotle\u2019s reference to Pythagorean optics as alluding to\nfifth-century Pythagoreans such as Philolaus. Archytas will then have\nbeen responsible for developing an already existing Pythagorean\noptical tradition into a science, rather than founding such a\ntradition.\n\nDiogenes Laertius reports that Archytas was \u201cthe first to\nsystematize mechanics by using mathematical first principles\u201d\n(VIII 83 = A1), and Archytas is accordingly sometimes hailed by modern\nscholars as the founder of the science of mechanics. There is a\npuzzle, however, since, no ancient Greek author in the later\nmechanical tradition (e.g., Heron, Pappus, Archimedes, Philon) ever\nascribes any work in the field to Archytas. What did the ancients mean\nby mechanics? A rough definition would be \u201cthe description and\nexplanation of the operation of machines\u201d (Knorr 1996). The\nearliest treatise in mechanics, the Mechanical Problems\nascribed to Aristotle, begins with problems having to do with a simple\nmachine, the lever. Pappus (AD 320) refers to machines used to lift\ngreat weights, machines of war such as the catapult, water lifting\nmachines, amazing devices (automata), and machines that served as\nmodels of the heavens (1024.12 \u2013 1025.4, on Pappus, see Cuomo\n2000). Pappus emphasizes, however, that, in addition to this practical\npart of mechanics, there is a theoretical part that is heavily\nmathematical (1022. 13\u201315). Given his interest in describing\nphysical phenomena in mathematical terms, it might seem logical that\nArchytas would make important contributions to mechanics. The actual\nevidence is less conclusive. A great part of the tendency to assign\nArchytas a role in the development of mechanics can be traced to\nPlutarch\u2019s story about the quarrel between Plato and Archytas\nover Archytas\u2019 supposed mechanical solution to the problem of\ndoubling the cube. This story is likely to be false (see 2.1 above).\nSome scholars have argued that Archytas devised machines of war (Diels\n1965; Cambiano 1998), as Archimedes did later, but this conclusion is\nbased on questionable inferences and no ancient source ascribes such\nmachines to Archytas. The only mechanical device that can with some\nprobability be assigned to Archytas, apart from the children\u2019s\ntoy known as a \u201cclapper\u201d (A10), is an automaton in the\nform of a wooden dove, which was connected to a pulley and\ncounterweight and \u201cflew\u201d up from a lower perch to a higher\none, when set in motion by a puff of air (A10a). Kingsley is deeply\ncritical of scholars who see these inventions as toys and suggests\nconnections to earlier Chinese inventors who produced a wooden bird\nthat could fly for military purposes (2014: 155\u20139). Others have\nsuggested that, since ancient siege devices were called by the names\nof animals (e.g., \u201ctortoise\u201d and \u201ccrow\u201d),\nArchytas\u2019 \u201cdove\u201d might have been an early catapult\nof his devising, or a projectile hurled by such a catapult, which was\nlater misunderstood to be a mechanical dove (Berryman 2003: 355; 2009:\n78). However, no ancient source explains the dove in this way. A\ncomplicating factor here is that Diogenes Laertius reports (A1) that\nthere was a book on mechanics in circulation, which some thought to be\nby a different Archytas, so that it is possible that the flying dove\nis, in fact, the work of a separate Archytas. Archytas\u2019 solution\nto the duplication of the cube, although it was not mechanical itself,\nwas of enormous importance for mechanics, since the solution to the\nproblem allows one not just to double a cube but also to construct\nbodies that are larger or smaller than a given body in any given\nratio. Thus, the solution permits the construction of a full-scale\nmachine on the basis of a working model. Pappus cites the solution to\nthe duplication of the cube as one of the three most crucial\ngeometrical theorems for practical mechanics (Math. Coll.\n1028. 18\u201321). It may then be that Archytas\u2019 primary\ncontribution to mechanics was precisely his solution to the\nduplication of the cube and that it is this solution which constituted\nthe mathematical first principles which Archytas provided for\nmechanics. For a recent discussion of these issues seen Berryman 2009:\n87\u201397. It is more doubtful that Archytas wrote a treatise on\nmechanics. Schofield has recently argued that the evidence for\nArchytas\u2019 work both in optics and in mechanics is so meagre that\nwe should \u201cbe skeptical about Archytas\u2019 alleged\nrole\u201d (2014: 86).\n",
