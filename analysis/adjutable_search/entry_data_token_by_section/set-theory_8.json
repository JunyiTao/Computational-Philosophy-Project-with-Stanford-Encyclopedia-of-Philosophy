    "main_text": "Set theory as the foundation of mathematics || The incompleteness phenomenon\n5.2 The incompleteness phenomenon\n\nG\u00f6del\u2019s completeness theorem for first-order logic implies\nthat ZFC is consistent\u2014i.e., no contradiction can be\nderived from it\u2014if and only if it has a model. A model\nof ZFC is a pair \\((M,E)\\), where \\(M\\) is a non-empty set and \\(E\\)\nis a binary relation on \\(M\\) such that all the axioms of ZFC are true\nwhen interpreted in \\((M,E)\\), i.e., when the variables that appear in\nthe axioms range over elements of \\(M\\), and \\(\\in\\) is interpreted as\n\\(E\\). Thus, if \\(\\varphi\\) is a sentence of the language of set\ntheory and one can find a model of ZFC in which \\(\\varphi\\) holds,\nthen its negation \\(\\neg \\varphi\\) cannot be proved in ZFC. Hence, if\none can find a model of \\(\\varphi\\) and also a model of \\(\\neg\n\\varphi\\), then \\(\\varphi\\) is neither provable nor disprovable in\nZFC, in which case we say that \\(\\varphi\\) is undecidable in,\nor independent of, ZFC.\n\nIn 1931, G\u00f6del announced his striking incompleteness theorems,\nwhich assert that any reasonable formal system for mathematics is\nnecessarily incomplete. In particular, if ZFC is consistent, then\nthere are propositions in the language of set theory that are\nundecidable in ZFC. Moreover, G\u00f6del\u2019s second incompleteness\ntheorem implies that the formal (arithmetical) statement \\(CON(ZFC)\\),\nwhich asserts that ZFC is consistent, while true, cannot be proved in\nZFC. And neither can its negation. Thus, \\(CON(ZFC)\\) is undecidable\nin ZFC.\n\nIf ZFC is consistent, then it cannot prove the existence of a model of\nZFC, for otherwise ZFC would prove its own consistency. Thus, a proof\nof consistency or of undecidability of a given sentence \\(\\varphi\\) is\nalways a relative consistency proof. That is, one assumes\nthat ZFC is consistent, hence it has a model, and then one constructs\nanother model of ZFC where the sentence \\(\\varphi\\) is true. We shall\nsee several examples in the next sections.\n",
