    "main_text": "The Concept of Progress || Progress vs. Development\n2.2 Progress vs. Development \n\n\u201cProgress\u201d is an axiological or a normative concept, which\nshould be distinguished from such neutral descriptive terms as\n\u201cchange\u201d and \u201cdevelopment\u201d (Niiniluoto 1995a).\nIn general, to say that a step from stage \\(A\\) to stage \\(B\\)\nconstitutes progress means that \\(B\\) is an improvement over\n\\(A\\) in some respect, i.e., \\(B\\) is better than \\(A\\)\nrelative to some standards or criteria. In science, it is a normative\ndemand that all contributions to research should yield some cognitive\nprofit, and their success in this respect can be assessed before\npublication by referees (peer review) and after publication by\ncolleagues. Hence, the theory of scientific progress is not merely a\ndescriptive account of the patterns of developments that science has\nin fact followed. Rather, it should give a specification of the\nvalues or aims that can be used as the constitutive\ncriteria for \u201cgood science.\u201d \n\nThe \u201cnaturalist\u201d program in science studies suggests that\nnormative questions in the philosophy of science can be reduced to\nhistorical and sociological investigations of the actual practice of\nscience. In this spirit, Laudan has defended the project of testing\nphilosophical models of scientific change by the history of science:\nsuch models, which are \u201coften couched in normative\nlanguage,\u201d can be recast \u201cinto declarative statements\nabout how science does behave\u201d (Laudan et al. 1986; Donovan et\nal. 1988). It may be the case that most scientific work, at least the\nbest science of each age, is also good science. But it is also evident\nthat scientists often have different opinions about the criteria of\ngood science, and rival researchers and schools make different choices\nin their preference of theories and research programs. Therefore, it\ncan be argued against the naturalists that progress should not be\ndefined by the actual developments of science: the definition\nof progress should give us a normative standard for appraising the\nchoices that the scientific communities have made, could have made,\nare just now making, and will make in the future. The task of finding\nand defending such standards is a genuinely philosophical one which\ncan be enlightened by history and sociology but which cannot be\nreduced to empirical studies of science. For the same reason,\nMizrahi\u2019s (2013) empirical observation that scientists talk\nabout the aim of science in terms of knowledge rather than merely\ntruth cannot settle the philosophical debate about scientific progress\n(cf. Bird, 2007, Niiniluoto, 2014).\n",
