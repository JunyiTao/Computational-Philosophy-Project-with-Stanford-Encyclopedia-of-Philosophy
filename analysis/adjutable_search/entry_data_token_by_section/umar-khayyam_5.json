    "main_text": "The Philosophical Works and Thoughts of Umar Khayyam || Determinism and Free Will\n2.5 Determinism and Free Will\nBoth his Western and Eastern expositors consider Khayyam to be a predeterminist (jabr\u012b). However, his views on the subject matter are far more complex. Some (Nasr, The Poet Scientist Khayyam as Philosopher; Aminrazavi 2007, 175) have interpreted \u201cOn Being and Obligation\u201d as a treatise on the problem of determinism and free will. According to Aminrazavi (2007, 175), Khayyam uses the term takl\u012bf (translated by Nasr (ibid) and Aminrazavi (ibid) as \u201cnecessity\u201d as well) to denote \u201cdeterminism.\u201d There is a short paragraph in The Necessity of Contrariety that Nasr and Aminrazavi interpret as indicating that Khayyam is inclined to \u201cpredeterminism,\u201d or \u201cdeterminism\u201d as they use the term, provided it is not taken to its extreme:\n\nAs to his question [i.e., Q\u0101d\u0323\u012b Nasaw\u012b\u2019s question] concerning which of the two groups [pre-determinists or free will theorists] are closer to truth, I say prima facie and at the first sight, perhaps the pre-determinists are closer to truth, provided they do not enter into their nonsensical and absurd [claims], for in this case they verily depart far from truth. (The Necessity of Contrariety, N\u0101j\u012b I\u1e63fah\u0101n\u012b (ed.) 2000, 169)\n\nAminrazavi (2007, 177\u201380), then, identifies and explains three types of \u201cdeterminism\u201d in Khayyam\u2019s view as follows:\n\nUniversal-cosmic\nSocio-economic\nOntological\n\nIn the universal and cosmic sense, our presence in this world and our entry and exit is predetermined, a condition that Khayyam bemoans throughout his Rub\u0101\u2018iyy\u0101t. The universal-cosmic determinism is the cause of our bewilderment and existential anxiety. Khayyam expresses this when he says:\n\nWith Earth\u2019s first Clay They did the Last Man knead,\nAnd there of the Last Harvest sow\u2019d the Seed:\nAnd the first Morning of Creation wrote\nWhat the Last Dawn of Reckoning shall read.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 (Rub\u0101\u2018iyy\u0101t, FitzGerald 1859, 41)\n\nThe second sense of determinism is Socio-economic, which is rarely addressed by Muslim philosophers. Khayyam incidentally refers to this notion, for example, in:\n\nGod created the human species such that it is not possible for it to survive and reach perfection unless it is through reciprocity, assistance, and help. Until food, clothes, and a home that are the essentials of life are not prepared, the possibility of the attainment of perfection does not exist. (On Being and Obligation, Hashemipour (ed.) 2000, 143).\n\nFinally there is \u201contological determinism,\u201d which relies on a Neoplatonic scheme of emanation which Khayyam considers to be \u201camong the most significant and complex of all questions,\u201d since \u201cthe order of the world is in accordance to how the wisdom of God decreed it\u201d (On Being and Obligation, Hashemipour (ed.) 2000, 145). He continues, \u201cobligation (takl\u012bf) is a command issued from God Most High, so people may attain those perfections that lead them to happiness\u201d (ibid, 143). This Greek concept of happiness, restated by F\u0101r\u0101b\u012b as \u201cFor every being is made to achieve the ultimate perfection it is susceptible of achieving according to its specific place in the order of being,\u201d (al-F\u0101r\u0101b\u012b 1973, 224) implies that our ontological status or capacity is (at least to some extent) pre-determined.\nHere, we have translated takl\u012bf as \u201cobligation\u201d (not \u201cnecessity\u201d) and jabr as \u201cpredeterminism\u201d (not \u201cdeterminism\u201d). This may be justified as follows: \u201cDeterminism\u201d as we use it today is considered to be compatible with free will (from the compatibilist point of view) but jabr, both in its historical context and in contemporary usage, is not considered to be compatible with free will. Furthermore, we are not sure how to interpret the short quote in response to the second question in The Necessity of Contrariety (N\u0101j\u012b I\u1e63fah\u0101n\u012b (ed.) 2000, 169). It can be interpreted as a formulation of Khayyam\u2019s dissatisfaction with both predeterminism and the free will view. This is because he says that predeterminism is closer to truth \u201cprima facie and at the first sight\u201d and then suggests that if the view is expanded, or fully applied, it can lead to nonsensical consequences. It is noteworthy that in the same passage he does not attempt to defend the free will view either. The original term for what has been translated as the \u201cfree will\u201d view here, is qadariyya (D\u0101nish n\u0101mah-yi Khayy\u0101m\u012b, Malik (ed.) 1998, 344, note 2). The term is associated with different views and problems, one of which is whether humans are the creators (kh\u0101liq) of their sinful acts. The term \u201ccreator\u201d is important in this context, particularly because it is not necessarily synonymous with \u201ccause\u201d and more importantly, because some, particularly in the early Islamic Kal\u0101m tradition, held the view that the only real creator is God. So, the context of this discussion is not just the metaphysics of causation, as we use the term. Finally, the above considerations make reconstructing Khayyam\u2019s view on this matter and mapping it on the contemporary views on \u201cdeterminism\u201d more difficult than it might initially appear. Khayyam has the concept of \u201cnecessitation\u201d (wuj\u016bb) and discusses that in his treatises on existence [references 5 and 6 above] at length. Thus, the three notions of \u201cdeterminism\u201d introduced by Aminrazavi may require further investigation.\n",
