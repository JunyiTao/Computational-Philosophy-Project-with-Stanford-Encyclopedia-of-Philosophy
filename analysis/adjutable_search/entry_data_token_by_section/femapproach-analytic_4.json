    "main_text": "Characteristics of Analytic Feminism || Doctrines, Desires, and Tools\n4.1 Doctrines, Desires, and Tools\n\nAlthough Cudd lists a few traditional concepts that analytic feminists\nwant to retain, she makes clear that this is no manifesto. Many who\nconsider themselves feminists in the analytic tradition hold that\nthere are no doctrines required of analytic feminists; indeed, there\nis even a spirit of contrarianism about such matters, including over\n\u201cthe univocality of \u2018women.\u2019\u201d Nevertheless,\nanalytic feminists share something that we might call a core\ndesire rather than a core doctrine, namely, the desire to retain\nenough of the central normative concepts of the modern European\ntradition to support the kind of normativity required by both feminist\npolitics and philosophy. For example, they believe that feminist\npolitics requires that claims about oppression or denial of rights be\ntrue or false and able to be justified and that philosophy requires\nmuch the same thing.\n\nThis \u201ccore desire\u201d finds its expression, for example, in\nthe ways analytic feminists use some of what we might call the\n\u201ccore concepts\u201d that Cudd mentions above: truth, logical\nconsistency, objectivity, rationality and justice. Although, as noted\nin the\n section 1\n above, analytic feminists agree with other feminist philosophers that\nimportant facets of these concepts are male-biased, analytic feminists\ndefend the concepts in ways that other feminists do not. At\nthe same time analytic feminists disagree among themselves about a\nnumber of matters, for example, what kinds of accounts of truth or\nobjectivity should prevail or whether scientific realism or\nanti-realism is a better strategy. We will spell out some of these\ndetails later as we discuss analytic feminists\u2019 defense of\nanalytic philosophy in the sixth section, on\n analytic feminists\u2019 responses to critiques.\n\nPieranna Garavaso\u2019s 2018 characterization of analytic feminism\nrecasts core concepts or desires in terms of toolkits and ways of\nreading:\n\n\nAnalytic feminists are philosophers who use methodological approaches\noften learned while training in analytic philosophy\u2014that is, the\never-expanding toolkit that may include such instruments as conceptual\nand logical analysis, use of argumentation, thought experiments,\ncounterexamples, and so forth\u2014and who read classical and\ncontemporary philosophical texts through a filter that highlights the\nexistence and the effects of various systems of social inequality such\nas gender, race, class, physical and mental abilities, and sexual\norientation.
