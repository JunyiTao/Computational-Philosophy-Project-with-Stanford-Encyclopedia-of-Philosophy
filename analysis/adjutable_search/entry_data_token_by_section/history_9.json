    "main_text": "Anglo-American philosophy of history\n3. Anglo-American philosophy of history\n\nThe traditions of empiricism and Anglo-American philosophy have also\ndevoted occasional attention to history. Philosophers in this\ntradition have avoided the questions of speculative philosophy of\nhistory and have instead raised questions about the logic and\nepistemology of historical knowledge. Here the guiding question is,\n\u201cWhat are the logical and epistemological characteristics of\nhistorical knowledge and historical explanation?\u201d.\n\nDavid Hume\u2019s empiricism cast a dominant key for almost all\nsubsequent Anglo-American philosophy, and this influence extends to\nthe interpretation of human behavior and the human sciences. Hume\nwrote a widely read history of England (1754\u20131762). His\ninterpretation of history was based on the assumption of ordinary\nactions, motives, and causes, with no sympathy for theological\ninterpretations of the past. His philosophical view of history was\npremised on the idea that explanations of the past can be based on the\nassumption of a fixed human nature.\n\nAnglo-American interest in the philosophy of history was renewed at\nmid-twentieth century with the emergence of \u201canalytical\nphilosophy of history.\u201d Representative contributors include Dray\n(1957, 1964, 1966), Danto (1965), and Gardiner (1952, 1974). This\napproach involves the application of the methods and tools of analytic\nphilosophy to the special problems that arise in the pursuit of\nhistorical explanations and historical knowledge (Gardiner 1952). Here\nthe interest is in the characteristics of historical knowledge: how we\nknow facts about the past, what constitutes a good historical\nexplanation, whether explanations in history require general laws, and\nwhether historical knowledge is underdetermined by available\nhistorical evidence. Analytic philosophers emphasized the empirical\nand scientific status of historical knowledge, and attempted to\nunderstand this claim along the lines of the scientific standing of\nthe natural sciences (Nagel 1961).\n\nPhilosophers in the analytic tradition are deeply skeptical about the\npower of non-empirical reason to arrive at substantive conclusions\nabout the structure of the world\u2014including human history.\nPhilosophical reasoning by itself cannot be a source of substantive\nknowledge about the natural world, or about the sequence of events,\nactions, states, classes, empires, plagues, and conquests that we call\n\u201chistory.\u201d Rather, substantive knowledge about the world\ncan only derive from empirical investigation and logical analysis of\nthe consequences of these findings. So analytic philosophers of\nhistory have had little interest in the large questions about the\nmeaning and structure of history considered above. The practitioners\nof speculative philosophy of history, on the other hand, are convinced\nof the power of philosophical thought to reason through to a\nfoundational understanding of history, and would be impatient with a\ncall for a purely empirical and conceptual approach to the\nsubject.\n\nW. H. Walsh\u2019s Philosophy of History (Walsh 1960 [1951]),\nfirst published in 1951 and revised in 1960, is an open-minded and\nwell-grounded effort to provide an in-depth presentation of the field\nthat crosses the separation between continental and analytical\nphilosophy. The book attempts to treat both major questions driving\nmuch of the philosophy of history: the nature of historical knowledge\nand the possibility of gaining \u201cmetaphysical\u201d knowledge\nabout history. An Oxford philosopher trained in modern philosophy,\nWalsh was strongly influenced by Collingwood and was well aware of the\nEuropean idealist tradition of philosophical thinking about history,\nincluding Rickert, Dilthey, and Croce, and he treats this tradition in\na serious way. He draws the distinction between these traditions along\nthe lines of \u201ccritical\u201d and \u201cspeculative\u201d\nphilosophy of history. Walsh\u2019s goal for the book is ambitious;\nhe hopes to propose a framework within which the main questions about\nhistory can be addressed, including both major traditions. He advances\nthe view that the historian is presented with a number of events,\nactions, and developments during a period. How do they hang together?\nThe process of cognition through which the historian makes sense of a\nset of separate historical events Walsh refers to as\n\u201ccolligation\u201d \u2014 \u201cto locate a historical event\nin a larger historical process in terms of which it makes sense\u201d\n(23).\n\nWalsh fundamentally accepts Collingwood\u2019s most basic premise:\nthat history concerns conscious human action. Collingwood\u2019s\nslogan was that \u201chistory is the science of the mind,\u201d and\nWalsh appears to accept much of this perspective. So the key\nintellectual task for the historian, on this approach, is to\nreconstruct the reasons or motives that actors had at various points\nin history (and perhaps the conditions that led them to have these\nreasons and motives). This means that the tools of interpretation of\nmeanings and reasons are crucial for the historian\u2014much as the\nhermeneutic philosophers in the German tradition had argued.\n\nWalsh suggests that the philosophical content of the philosophy of\nhistory falls naturally into two different sorts of inquiry, parallel\nto the distinction between philosophy of nature and philosophy of\nscience. The first has to do with metaphysical questions about the\nreality of history as a whole; the latter has to do with the epistemic\nissues that arise in the pursuit and formulation of knowledge of\nhistory. He refers to these approaches as \u201cspeculative\u201d\nand \u201ccritical\u201d aspects of the philosophy of history. And\nhe attempts to formulate a view of what the key questions are for each\napproach. Speculative philosophy of history asks about the meaning and\npurpose of the historical process. Critical philosophy of history is\nwhat we now refer to as \u201canalytic\u201d philosophy; it is the\nequivalent for history of what the philosophy of science is for\nnature.\n",
