    "main_text": "\n\nMarsilius of Inghen, master at the Universities of Paris\n(1362\u20131378) and Heidelberg (1386\u20131396), wrote a number of\ntreatises on logic, natural philosophy and theology popular at many\nlate medieval and early modern universities. He adopted the\nlogico-semantic approach of William of Ockham and John Buridan while\nat the same time defending the traditional views of Thomas Aquinas and\nBonaventure. His thinking sheds light on the discussion between\nnominalists and realists and allows insight into the changing\ninterests of philosophy and theology, from the critical attitude of\nmany fourteenth-century authors to the search for tradition which was\ncharacteristic of the fifteenth century.\n",
