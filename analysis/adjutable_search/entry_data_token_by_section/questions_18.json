    "main_text": "Embedded (or indirect) questions || Information provision versus contextualism\n4.4 Information provision versus contextualism\n\nBraun (2006) offers a very different account of knowledge-wh on which\nthe question-answer relationship underlying knowledge-wh is much less\nformal, and this makes it very easy to have knowledge-wh on\nBraun\u2019s account.\n\nConsider this example:\n\n (46) Who is Hong Oak\nYun? \n\n\nExamples like (46) are identity questions, which seem\nintuitively to call for a dimension of context-dependence that\nstandard theories of the question-answer relationship do not\naccommodate. The idea is that different ways of identifying Hong Oak\nYun are relevant in different contexts; accordingly, different\npropositions count as answers (or as correct answers) to (46) in\ndifferent contexts. Aloni (2005) provides a recent example of a theory\ndesigned to accommodate this idea.\n\nBraun (2006), however, rejects the idea entirely. According to\nBraun\u2019s (2006, 26) information provision account of\nquestions, \u201cto answer a question is simply to provide\ninformation about the subject matter of the question.\u201d That is,\n(46) is answered by any proposition that provides information about\nHong Oak Yun, even the proposition expressed by \u2018Hong Oak Yun is\na person who is over three inches tall\u2019. This answer may not\nsatisfy or be useful to or be informative for the speaker who poses\n(46), but it counts as an answer despite these purely pragmatic\nfailings, according to Braun\u2019s theory. To know who Hong Oak\nYun is, according to Braun, is simply to know the truth of a\nproposition that answers (46), which is to say, to know the truth of\nany proposition that provides information about Hong Oak Yun.\nBraun\u2019s view contrasts with the contextualism of Bo\u00ebr and\nLycan (1986) according to which knowing who Hong Oak Yun is requires\nknowing a proposition that provides contextually relevant information\nabout Hong Oak Yun. Another contextualist alternative to Braun\u2019s\nview is the view of Masto (2010), according to which (46) denotes a\ncontextually determined set of possible answers, and knowing who Hong\nOak Yun is consists in being able to choose or recognize the correct\nanswer from that contextually determined set.\n",
