    "main_text": "Conscience as motivation to act morally\n4. Conscience as motivation to act morally\n\nConscience can also be conceived as our sense of duty. According to\nthis understanding, conscience motivates us to act according to moral\nprinciples or beliefs we already possess (e.g., D\u2019Arcy 1963;\nChildress 1979; McGuire 1963; Fuss 1964). Conscience so understood\n\u201cestablishes a general sense of moral obligation in the\nindividual\u2019s consciousness\u201d (Fuss 1964: 116). The\nsubjective character of conscience implies that the motivational force\nmust come entirely from within the individual, as opposed to sanctions\nfrom an external authority.\n\nA powerful motivational source is represented by the feelings that\nconscience generates in its self-assessment function. As we said at\nthe beginning, the different understandings of conscience presented\nhere are not necessarily mutually exclusive. Conscience as\nself-assessment and conscience as motivation to act morally constitute\na good example of perspectives on conscience which are not only\nconsistent with one another, but which actually complete one another.\nIn Kant, for example, the theory of conscience can be seen as \u201ca\nmotivation theory set in the context of a reflection theory\u201d\n(Wood 2008: 183): As Wood interprets the Kantian notion of conscience,\n\u201cconscience is a feeling of pleasure or displeasure associated\nwith myself\u201d that arises when I comply or don\u2019t comply\nwith moral principles and that motivates me to act in one sense rather\nthan the other when the feeling accompanies the contemplation of a\ncertain course of action (Wood 2008: 183\u2013184). Conscience for\nKant is therefore not only an inner court, but also the source of our\nsense of duty in that it takes the judgments of the inner court as\nmotivation to act morally (Kant 1797 [1991]: 161).\n\nMore generally, as we have seen in\n section 1,\n conscience\u2019s self-assessment often produces remorse or other\nnegative feelings (guilt, shame, fear, and so on). Our desire or\ntendency to avoid this form of self-punishment can have motivational\nforce towards acting morally. Thus, for instance, according to\nChildress the motive for acting morally that defines conscience is\n\u201cin part, avoidance of a sanction imposed by the self on\nitself\u201d (Childress 1979: 328).\n\nConsistent with this philosophical view are studies in developmental\npsychology suggesting that the emotion of guilt, which is typically\nseen as one of the products of conscience as self-assessment, is\n\u201cthe motivational engine that infuses misdeeds with negative\npersonal valence\u201d (Kochanska and Aksan 2006: 1589).\nTransgression generates anxious feelings in most children, and these\nnegative feelings help children suppress future wrongdoing and\ninternalize the relative moral norms (Dam\u00e1sio 1994, as reported\nin Kochanska and Aksan 2006: 1595).\n\nHowever, at the same time, the negative self-directed feelings must\nthemselves be generated by previous experience of tension between our\naction and a pre-existing sense of duty. Although it might seem that\nwe are stuck in an infinite regress, where sense of duty and negative\nself-directed feelings presuppose one another, this need not be the\ncase. It is possible to conceive of an external or independent source\nof that most fundamental sense of duty that constitutes our\nconscience, such as for example our moral education and upbringing\n(Mill 1861: ch. 3). But the sense of duty that identifies a\nconscientious person can also be conceived as a primitive function, an\ninnate disposition which is not explained by any other more\nfundamental mechanism. In Kant, for instance, \u201cevery human\nbeing, as a moral being, has a conscience within him originally\u201d\n(Kant 1797 [1991]: 160), and conscience is one of the four\n\u201cnatural predispositions of the mind (\u2026) for being\naffected by concepts of duty\u201d, the other three being moral\nfeeling, love for one\u2019s neighbors, and respect for oneself (Kant\n1797 [1991]: 160). \n\nNegative feelings and sense of duty are not always successful in\nprompting agents to do what their moral principles require. But the\n\u201cbites of conscience\u201d, or just the prospect of bites of\nconscience, act as motivational force towards aligning our future\nbehavior to those norms. Of course, positive feelings associated with\nconscience might also have a motivational force. For example, as seen\nabove, Kant associated conscience also with positive feelings about\noneself when the agent recognizes he has acted according to his sense\nof duty. Rousseau, alongside the epistemic account of conscience\npresented above, also provides in Emile a motivational\naccount of conscience based on positive feelings: while reason gives\nus knowledge of the good, it is conscience, through a sentiment of\nlove for the good, which motivates us to behave morally (Rousseau\n1762).\n",
