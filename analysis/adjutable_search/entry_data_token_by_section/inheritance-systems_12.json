    "main_text": "Classification of Inheritance Systems || Mechanismic Classification of Inheritance Systems\n3.3 Mechanismic Classification of Inheritance Systems\n\nJablonka and Lamb characterize four broadly defined inheritance\nsystems: two fairly specific inheritance systems \u2014 the\ngenetic inheritance system and the symbolic inheritance\nsystem found in human languages \u2014 and two classes of\ninheritance systems \u2014 cellular and organismal epigenetic\ninheritance systems and behavioral inheritance systems.\nThe systems are classified and grouped according to the way they store\nand transmit variations and by the properties of the hereditary\nrelations they give rise to.\n\nJablonka and Lamb\u2019s classification of inheritance systems on the\nbasis of their mechanismic differences is not the only classification\napproach which focuses on hereditary variations. Recently,\nHelanter\u00e4 & Uller (2010) analyzed the inheritance systems\nJablonka and Lamb identified based on their evolutionary consequences.\nThey claim that Jablonka and Lamb\u2019s mechanismic classification\ndoes not match a classification of means of inheritance according to\ntheir evolutionary properties, and suggested classifying them into\nthree categories: vertical transmission which covers cases in\nwhich traits are transmitted from parent to offspring such as genetic\ninheritance and some epigenetic phenomena; induction which\ncovers cases in which the environment determines change between parent\nand offspring such as induced genetic mutations and maternal effects;\nand acquisition which covers cases in which traits originate\nfrom non-parental individuals or other sources, for example horizontal\ngene transfer and various forms of learning. Similarly, Day and\nBonduriansky (2011), using a unified framework based on the Price\nEquation, have argued that while the diversity of inheritance\nmechanisms is very large they give rise to a much more limited set of\ninheritance patterns, characterized as unique combinations of\nreproductive transmission rules.\n\nThe properties of the inheritance systems that Jablonka and Lamb chose\nto study are those they deemed to be most pertinent for understanding\ninheritance, and its evolutionary consequences (Jablonka 2001: 100).\nIn more recent work Jablonka and Lamb (2005/2014) distinguish between\nproperties of the way information is reproduced, and properties\nrelated to whether variation is targeted, responsive to the\nenvironment, or otherwise biased (the so-called \u201cLamarckian\ndimension\u201d). Among the properties of reproduction of information\nthat they identify are whether reproduction results from ordinary\ncellular activity and relies on general purpose cellular mechanisms or\nwhether a dedicated copying system (i.e., cellular machinery) exists;\nwhether the inheritance system can transmit latent (unexpressed)\ninformation or is information necessarily expressed phenotypically;\nand whether information is transmitted solely to offspring (referred\nto as vertical transmission) or to neighbors as well\n(horizontal transmission).\n\nThe properties related to targeting, constructing, and planning of\ntransmitted variation that Jablonka and Lamb identify are:\n\nIs variation targeted, in the sense that the production of\nvariants is biased towards producing some possible variants (i.e.,\n\u201cnon-random\u201d)?\nIs variation subject to developmental filtering and modification\nbefore transmission, as found for example in behavioral\ninheritance?\nIs variation constructed through direct planning by the\norganisms?\nCan variations change the selective environment, for example by\nchanging the environmental niche the organism occupies?\n\n\nWe now describe in more detail each of inheritance systems Jablonka\nand Lamb identified. Jablonka\u2019s and Lamb\u2019s analysis of\ninheritance systems is summarized in tables 1 and 2.\n\n\n\nInheritance system\nOrganizations of information\nDedicated copying system?\nTransmits latent (nonexpressed) information?\nDirections of transmission\nRange of variation \n\nGenetic\nModular\nYes\nYes\nMostly vertical\nUnlimited \n\nEpigenetic\n \n\nSelf-sustaining loops\nHolistic\nNo\nNo\nMostly vertical\nLimited at the loop level, unlimited at the cell level\n\n\nStructural templating\nHolistic\nNo\nNo\nMostly vertical\nLimited at the structure level, unlimited at the cell level\n\n\nRNA silencing\nHolistic\nYes\nSometimes\nVertical and sometimes horizontal\nLimited at the single transcript level, unlimited at the cell\nlevel \n\nChromatin marks\nModular and holistic\nYes (for methylation)\nSometimes\nVertical\nUnlimited \n\nOrganism-level developmental legacies\nHolistic\nNo\nNo\nMostly vertical\nLimited \n\nBehavioral\n \n\nBehavior-affecting substances\nHolistic\nNo\nNo\nBoth vertical and horizontal\nLimited at the single behavior level, unlimited for\nlifestyles \n\nNonimitative social learning\nHolistic\nNo\nNo\nBoth vertical and horizontal\nLimited at the single behavior level, unlimited for\nlifestyles \n\nImitation\nModular\nProbably\nNo\nBoth vertical and horizontal\nUnlimited \n\nSymbolic\nModular and holistic\nYes, several\nYes\nBoth vertical and horizontal\nUnlimited \n\n\nTable 1.

Targeting, constructing, and\nplanning transmitted variation\n\n\n(The tables above are reproduced with permission from Eva Jablonka and\nMarion J. Lamb, Evolution In Four Dimensions: Genetic, Epigenetic,\nBehavioral, and Symbolic Variation In The History Of Life, MIT\nPress 2005.)\n3.3.1 The Genetic Inheritance System (GIS)\n\nThe genetic inheritance system (GIS) uses the nucleotide sequence in\nnucleic acids, typically DNA, to store and transmit information (i.e.,\nhereditary variation), and includes the machinery responsible for DNA\nreplication, error correction etc. The GIS uses encoded\ninformation, as nucleotide sequences code for amino acids that form\nproteins using the genetic code which specifies which amino acid\ncorresponds to each triplet of nucleotides (called a codon). The DNA\nsequence also specifies functional RNA molecules. DNA nucleotides can\nbe modified independently of each other, a property referred to as\nmodular organization; it has been argued that coded\ninformation requires modular replication (Szathm\u00e1ry 2000).\nGenerally speaking, the genetic system provides unlimited\nheredity, since the nucleotide sequence is not limited in size,\nand each position in it can contain any nucleotide. These,\nparticularly the claim that the sequence length is unconstrained, are\nof course idealized assumptions. Unlimited heredity and modularity are\nmost often attributed to the genetic system as a whole, not only to\nprotein coding regions, and it is often argued that they are unique to\nit. Like the GIS, the symbolic inheritance system (discussed below),\nwhich is restricted to human beings, exhibits unlimited and modular\nheredity.\n\nVarious kinds of regulatory regions in DNA are spread throughout most\ngenomes. They comprise \u201cnon-coding\u201d sequences, in the\nsense that they do not code for proteins and do not depend on the\ngenetic code. Regulatory regions affect gene expression and chromatin\ndynamics. It is still debated in the scientific community whether\nthere are general properties of sequence organization that determine\nthese functions, which would suggest a high-order code. It should be\nnoted that various non-coding sequences interact in specific ways with\nepigenetic mechanisms (such as DNA methylation and histone\nmodifications) in order to produce their regulatory effects. The\ngenome which is the seat of genetic information is also a focal point\nfor the operation of critical epigenetic mechanisms, and it may turn\nout not to be possible to fully understand the properties of the\ngenetic inheritance system and its evolution in isolation from\nepigenetic inheritance (Jablonka & Lamb 2008; Lamm 2011,\n2014).\n\nSome mechanisms that generate variation in DNA are invoked in\nparticular conditions (e.g., stress conditions), and produce variation\nthat is non-random in location and/or pattern (e.g., Levy &\nFeldman 2004; reviewed in Jablonka & Lamb 2005: chap. 3). However,\nit is widely perceived that most genetic variations are the result of\nnon-directed processes that are not responsive to specific inducing\nconditions.\n3.3.2 Epigenetic Inheritance Systems (EISs)\n\nEpigenetic inheritance occurs when environmentally-induced and\ndevelopmentally-regulated variations, or variations that are the\nresult of developmental noise, are transmitted to subsequent\ngenerations of cells or organisms (Jablonka & Lamb 2005). The term\nepigenetic inheritance is used in a broad sense and in a narrow sense.\nThe narrow sense refers to the systems that underlie cellular\nheredity. Four EISs in the narrow sense are discussed by Jablonka and\nLamb (2005/2014): (1) Self-sustaining steady-states of metabolic\ncycles. Transmission of the components of the cycle, such as proteins\nand metabolites, can lead to reconstruction of the cycle in the\ndaughter cell. Self-sustaining loops can also maintain the\ntranscription levels of genes. For example, a transcriptional\nself-sustaining loop is most likely responsible for white-opaque\nswitching in Candida albicans, a change in phenotypic state\nthat involves a change in cell appearance, mating behavior, and\npreferred host tissues that is heritable for many generations. (2)\nStructural inheritance of cell structures, such as cellular membranes\nand the cilia on the cell surface of ciliates. (3) Chromatin marking\nof various kinds that consists of molecular marks on chromosomes\n(specifically, DNA methylation and histone modifications, which\ninvolve chemical groups attached to DNA and to proteins around which\nthe DNA molecules are wrapped in eukaryotic cells). Some of these\nmarks are copied by dedicated copying machinery, others seem to be\nreconstructed as a result of regular genome dynamics from partial\nmarkings transmitted to daughter cells (e.g., Henikoff, Furuyama,\n& Ahmad 2004; reviewed in Lamm 2014). (4) Inheritance of small RNA\nmolecules that affect gene expression. The most well-known case\ninvolves RNA silencing (RNAi), a post-transcriptional silencing\nmechanism, though more and more classes of regulatory RNA molecules\nand related pathways are being identified and characterized.\n\nEpigenetics in the broad sense refers to two kinds of inheritance. (1)\nCellular epigenetic inheritance through mitotic cells and\ntransgenerational epigenetic inheritance through meiotic cells.\nTransgenerational heredity of DNA methylation has been observed in\nunicellular organisms, plants, and mammals, suggesting that\ntransgenerational epigenetic inheritance may be more prevalent than\noften suspected (Jablonka & Raz 2009). (2) Hereditary effects that\nby-pass the germline, for example through early developmental inputs\nthat lead to regeneration of previous developmental conditions (e.g.,\nhormonal and neural conditions) and other forms of phenotypic\ntransmission, such as the transmission of symbionts and\nparasites, e.g., gut bacteria (Jablonka & Raz 2009).\n\nIn transgenerational epigenetic transmission, alternative phenotypes\ncan persist for several, possibly many, generations, though their\npersistence may be more limited than that of genetic changes. They may\nthus have evolutionary effects in addition to the role played by\ncellular epigenetic inheritance in the development of multi-cellular\norganisms that was noted above. Generally, epigenetic inheritance\npiggybacks on general developmental and physiological mechanisms of\ncells, and is a by product of other physiological functions, not the\nresult of an independent copying system that is content neutral; DNA methylation is a\nnotable exception. Epigenetic inheritance typically is\nholistic rather than modular in its storage and transmission\n(i.e., it is not comprised of units of information that can be changed\nindependently of one another), and supports a limited\nrepertoire of hereditary variants (e.g., the steady-states of a\nmetabolic cycle). However, one cell may include many instances of\nindependent self-sustaining metabolic cycles and structurally\ntransmitted cellular components, for example, increasing the\nrepertoire of cellular variations that can be inherited via these\nforms of inheritance. Typically, EISs (with some exceptions, such as\nDNA methylation) cannot transmit unexpressed (latent) information,\nalthough the transmission of partial factors or marks, which are not\nsufficient for expression, may be reliably sufficient when additional\ndevelopmental factors are added.\n3.3.3 Behavioral Inheritance Systems (BISs)\n\nJablonka and Lamb (Jablonka 2001; Jablonka & Lamb 2005) focus on\nthree types of behavioral inheritance: (1) Inheritance of\nbehavior-affecting substances. The inducing substances bias the\nbehavior of offspring leading to limited behavioral heredity. A\nparadigmatic case is the \u201ctransmission\u201d of food\npreferences from mother to offspring via molecular cues passed through\nthe placenta. (2) Non-imitative social learning that leads to\nsimilarity in behavior. Here, naive organisms learn through\ninteraction with environmental circumstances that elicit particular\nbehavior and by observing the behavior of experienced adults, though\nnot by copying or imitating their behavior. A famous case of\nnon-imitative social learning involved the spread of milk-bottle\nopening behavior in blue tits and great tits. It appears that the\nbehavior spread through the contact of birds with open milk-bottles or\nwith experienced birds using bottles as food sources, not by imitating\nthe method of opening the bottles. (3) Imitation and instruction. In\ncontrast with the other behavioral inheritance systems, imitation is\nmodular (behavioral patterns are imitated independently of other\npatterns in the same behavioral sequence) and may depend on a\ndedicated copying system or systems.\n\nWhile the GIS and EISs transmit information mostly from parent to\noffspring (i.e., vertically), all behavioral inheritance\nsystems are directly or indirectly influenced by the social\nenvironment, and are thus capable of transmitting information to\nneighbors as well, that is horizontally. A second property\nshared by behavioral forms of inheritance is that for a behavior to be\ntransmitted it has to be expressed.\n3.3.4 The Symbolic Inheritance System (SIS)\n\nThe symbolic inheritance system refers to all symbolic communication,\nbut mainly to linguistic communication, and is unique to humans. The\nsymbolic inheritance system shares some properties with the genetic\ninheritance system, notably modularity, unlimited\nvariability, the use of coded information, and the\ncapacity to transmit latent information. Its origins are in\nbehavioral inheritance and it shares some of the properties of\nbehavioral inheritance, in particular the capacity for horizontal\ntransmission and developmental filtering of variation\nprior to transmission.\n\nJablonka and Lamb\u2019s account of cultural evolution in humans\nappeals to the properties of symbolic inheritance, most critically\nthat variations are not blindly copied but rather reconstructed by\nlearners in ways that are sensitive to meaning, social context, and\nthe history of the individuals involved (Jablonka & Lamb\n2005/2014). They contrast their view with the meme based account of\ncultural evolution presented by Dawkins and Blackmore (e.g., Blackmore\n1999), which takes cultural items to be stored in human brains and\ntransmitted to other human agents in the form of faithful replication,\nand cultural change to involve the differential success of replication\nof the different cultural items. Jablonka and Lamb argue that focusing\non replication and selection rather than on the generation of variants\nand on reconstruction processes is particularly harmful for\nunderstanding cultural evolution.\n",
