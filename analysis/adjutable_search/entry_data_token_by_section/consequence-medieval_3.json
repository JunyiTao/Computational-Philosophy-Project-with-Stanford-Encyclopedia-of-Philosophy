    "main_text": "Early Theories of Consequence || Abelard\n2.2 Abelard\n\nThe period from Boethius in the 6th century to Abelard in the\n12th century remains for now quite understudied, in particular as a consequence of the scarcity of extant manuscript evidence. As far as we can tell, the approach to logic in the 8th and 9th centuries appears to have been largely Platonist and metaphysical in character (Wilks 2016). Subsequently, a more linguistic orientation began to emerge, including investigations into inferential relations between categorical and hypothetical statements (Wilks 2016). It seems fair to say, however, that none of these investigations count as fully-fledged theories of consequence.\n\n\nIndeed, it was only in the\n12th century, with Abelard, that a\nnovel and highly sophisticated theory of consequence/entailment was to\nbe formulated. Abelard\u2019s starting point is the same material inherited\nfrom Boethius which had been available for centuries, and yet what he\ndoes with it is quite extraordinary; in particular, he understood\nbetter than anyone before him the nature of what we now refer to as\npropositional operations. His treatment of the conditional and of the disjunction echoes what is now known as connective logic (Martin 2018) (see entry on connective logic of this encyclopedia). And yet, his account is ultimately untenable, as the resulting system is in fact inconsistent (Martin 2004) (Martin 2018).\n\nTellingly, his theory of consequence is presented in the part of the\nDialectica dedicated to the topical framework (the book\nDe Locis), which again illustrates the close historical\nconnections between theories of consequence and the Topics.\nAbelard speaks mostly of \u2018inferentia\u2019 rather than\n\u2018consequentia\u2019, as the latter is for him a\nsubspecies of the former. He defines the concept of\ninferentia as follows:\n\nTherefore, inference consists in the necessity of consecution, that\nis, in that the sense (sententia) of the consequent is\nrequired (exigitur) by the sense (sensus) of the\nantecedent, as is asserted with a hypothetical proposition \u2026\n(Dial. 253, translation from (Martin 2004, 170))\n\n\nThe phrase \u2018necessity of consecution\u2019 could be viewed as\nAbelard\u2019s formulation of the criterion of necessary truth-preservation\n(TP), but he seems to demand something more than mere\ntruth-preservation, namely a tighter connection of relevance\n(exigitur) between the senses of antecedent and consequent\n(Martin 2004, section II.5). Indeed, Abelard seems to entertain\ndifferent conceptions of the containment relation (Co) between\nantecedent and consequent: as a metaphysical (Dial. 255),\nsemantic (Dial. 253), and epistemic (Dial. 255)\nrelation.\n\nAbelard then further distinguishes perfect from imperfect\n inferences,[6]\n and this distinction sets him apart from the whole preceding\ntradition:\n\nBut inferences are either perfect or imperfect. An inference is\nperfect when, from the structure of the antecedent itself, the truth\nof the consequent is manifest, and the construction of the antecedent\nis so disposed that it contains also the construction of the\nconsequent in itself, just as in syllogisms or in conditionals which\nhave the form of syllogisms. (Dial. 253/4)\n\n\nHe goes on to argue that what warrants a perfect inference, i.e. its\n\u2018vis inferentiae\u2019, is the construction itself:\n\u201c\u2018the truth of perfect inferences comes from the structure\n(complexio), not from the nature of things\u201d\n(Dial. 255). This is a novel development, as for authors such\nas Boethius and those following him, the warrant of all\nconsequences is ultimately to be found in the \u2018nature of\nthings\u2019, and is captured by means of topical principles.\n(Abelard then goes on to provide arguments directed against this\nBoethian view, see (MacFarlane 2000, A.4).) What Abelard refers to as\nthe construction/structure of an inference is indeed roughly what we\nnow understand as a schema (see entry on schemata of this\nencyclopedia), as his discussion of examples suggests: it is the\nsubstitution of terms by other terms while preserving the\nconsecution (i.e. a version of (ST)) that is the hallmark of perfect\ninferences. \u201cWhatever terms you substitute, whether they are\ncompatible or incompatible with one another, the consecution can in no\nway be broken.\u201d (Dial. 255, translation from Martin\n2004, 171)\n\nNow, while proto-traces of the substitutional conception of validity\ncould be perceived in Aristotle as well as in some of the ancient\ncommentators, with Abelard it is (arguably) for the first time\npresented as providing the grounds for a certain class of\nconsequences. And yet, Abelard\u2019s conception of consequence is not\nreduced to (ST), given that imperfect inferences are just as\nlegitimate/valid as the perfect ones: imperfect inferences are those\nthat fail the substitution criterion but satisfy the \u2018necessity\nof consecution\u2019 criterion. Thus, for Abelard, (ST) defines a\nspecial subclass among valid inferences, but a combination of (TP) and\n(Co) remains the true core of his notion of inference/consequence (see\nDial. 283\u20134 for two senses of necessity of consecution).\nIndeed, in his subsequent discussion he deals with imperfect\ninferences much more extensively than with the perfect ones.\n\nMany of Abelard\u2019s logical concepts were tacitly absorbed by later\nauthors, though not by means of direct influence, and often with no\nexplicit attribution to Abelard (Martin 2004). Ultimately, the\nAbelardian approach to consequences did not prevail (Normore 2015). It\nis revealing that we now have only one surviving copy of his\nDialectica, a clear sign that it was not widely read.\n",
