    "main_text": "Small Set Theories\n9. Small Set Theories\n\nIt is commonly noted that set theory produces far more superstructure\nthan is needed to support classical mathematics. In this section, we\ndescribe two miniature theories which purport to provide enough\nfoundations without nearly as much superstructure. Our \u201cpocket\nset theory\u201d (motivated by a suggestion of Rudy Rucker) is just\nsmall; Vopenka\u2019s alternative set theory is also\n\u201cnonstandard\u201d in its approach.\n",
