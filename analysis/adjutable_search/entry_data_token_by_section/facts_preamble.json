    "main_text": "\n\nFacts, philosophers like to say, are opposed to theories and to values\n(cf. Rundle 1993) and are to be distinguished from things, in\nparticular from complex objects, complexes and wholes, and from\nrelations. They are the objects of certain mental states and acts,\nthey make truth-bearers true and correspond to truths, they are part\nof the furniture of the world. Not only do philosophers oppose facts\nto theories and to values, they sometimes distinguish between facts\nwhich are brute and those which are not (Anscombe 1958). We present\nand discuss some philosophical and formal accounts of facts.\n",
