    "main_text": "Gibbsian Statistical Mechanics (GSM) || Equilibrium: Why Does Phase Averaging Work?\n6.2 Equilibrium: Why Does Phase Averaging Work?\n\nThe standard justification of phase averaging that one finds in many\ntextbooks is based on the notion of ergodicity that we have already\nencountered in\n Section 4.4.\n In the current context, we consider the infinite time\naverage \\(f^{*}\\)of the function \\(f\\). It is a mathematical fact\nthat ergodicity as defined earlier is equivalent to it being the case\nthat \\(f^{*} = \\langle f \\rangle\\) for almost all initial states. This\nis reported to provide a justification for phase averaging as follows.\nAssume we carry out a measurement of the physical quantity represented\nby \\(f\\). It will take some time to carry out the measurement, and so\nwhat the measurement device registers is the time average over the\nduration of the measurement. Indeed, the time needed to make the\nmeasurement is long compared to the time scale on which typical\nmolecular processes take place, the measured result is approximately\nequal to the infinite time average \\(f^{*}\\). By ergodicity, \\(f^{*}\\)\nis equal to \\(\\langle f\\rangle\\), which justifies the averaging\nprinciple.\n\nThis argument fails for several reasons (Malament & Zabell 1980;\nSklar 1993: 176\u20139). First, from the fact that measurements take\ntime it does not follow that what is measured are time averages, and\neven if one could argue that measurement devices output time averages,\nthese would be finite time averages and equating these finite\ntime averages with infinite time averages is problematic because\nfinite and infinite averages can assume very different values even if\nthe duration of the finite measurement is very long. Second, this\naccount makes a mystery of how we observe change. As we have seen in\n Section 1,\n we do observe how systems approach equilibrium, and in doing so we\nobserve macro-variables changing their values. If measurements\nproduced infinite time averages, then no change would ever be observed\nbecause these averages are constant. Third, as we already noted\nearlier, ergodicity is a stringent condition and many systems to which\nSM is successfully applied are not ergodic (Earman & R\u00e9dei\n1996), which makes equating time averages and phase averages\nwrong.\n\nA number of approaches have been designed to either solve or\ncircumvent these problems. Malament and Zabell (1980) suggest a method\nof justifying phase averaging that still invokes ergodicity but avoids\nan appeal to time averages. Vranas (1998) offers a reformulation of\nthis argument for systems that are epsilon-ergodic (see\n \u00a74.4).\n This accounts for systems that are \u201calmost\u201d ergodic, but\nremains silent about systems that are far from being ergodic. Khinchin\n(1949) restricts attention to systems with a large number of degrees\nof freedom and so-called sum functions (i.e., functions that can are a\nsum over one-particle functions), and shows that for such systems\n\\(f^{*} = \\langle f\\rangle\\) holds on the largest part of \\(X\\); for a\ndiscussion of this approach see Batterman (1998) and Badino (2006).\nHowever, as Khinchin himself notes, the focus on sum-functions is too\nrestrictive to cover realistic systems, and the approach also has to\nrevert to the implausible posit that observations yield infinite time\naverages. This led to a research programme now known as the\n\u201cthermodynamic limit\u201d, aiming to prove\n\u201cKhinchin-like\u201d results under more realistic assumptions.\nClassic statements are Ruelle (1969, 2004); for a survey and further\nreferences see Uffink (2007: 1020\u20138).\n\nA different approach to the problem insists that one should take the\nstatus of \\(\\rho(x)\\) as a probability seriously and seek a\njustification of averaging in statistical terms. In this vein, Wallace\n(2015) insists that the quantitative content of statistical mechanics\nis exhausted by the statistics of observables (their expectation\nvalues, variances, and so on) and McCoy (2020) submits that\n\\(\\rho(x)\\) is the complete physical state of an individual\nstatistical mechanical system. Such a view renounces the association\nof measurement outcomes with phase averages and insists that\nmeasurements are \u201can instantaneous act, like taking a\nsnapshot\u201d (O. Penrose 1970: 17\u201318): if a measurement of\nthe quantity associated with \\(f\\) is performed on a system at time\n\\(t\\) and the system\u2019s micro-state at time \\(t\\) is \\(x(t)\\),\nthen the measurement outcome at time \\(t\\) will be \\(f(x(t))\\). An\nobvious consequence of this definition is that measurements at\ndifferent times can have different outcomes, and the values of\nmacro-variables can change over time. One can then look at how these\nvalues change over time. One way of doing this is to look at\nfluctuations away from the average: \n\\[\\Delta(t) = f\\left( x(t) \\right) - \\left\\langle f \\right\\rangle,\\]\n\n\nwhere \\(\\Delta(t)\\) is the fluctuation away from the average at time\n\\(t\\). One can then expect that a that the outcome of a measurement\nwill be \\(\\langle f\\rangle\\) if fluctuations turn out to be small and\ninfrequent. Although this would not seem to be the received textbook\nposition, something like it can be identified in some, for instance\nHill (1956 [1987]) and Schr\u00f6dinger (1952 [1989]). A precise\narticulation will have to use \\(\\rho\\) to calculate the probability of\nfluctuations of a certain size, and this requires the system to meet\nstringent dynamical conditions, namely either the masking condition\nor\u00a0the f-independence condition (Frigg & Werndl\n2021).\n",
