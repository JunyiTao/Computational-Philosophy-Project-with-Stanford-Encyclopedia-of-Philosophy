Time and Physics\n\nOur best physical theories have often had implications for the nature\nof time, and by and large, it is assumed that philosophers working on\ntime need to be sensitive to the claims of contemporary physics. One\nexample of the interaction between physics and philosophy of time that\nwas mentioned in\n Section 2\n was Newton\u2019s bucket argument, which used the observed effects\nof acceleration to argue for absolute motion (and thus absolute space\nand time). Another example mentioned above was the worry that the\nA-theory conflicted with special relativity. The latter has proved\nespecially influential in contemporary metaphysics of time and so\ndeserves some further discussion.\n\nAccording to standard presentations of special relativity, there is no\nfact of the matter as to whether two spatially separated events happen\nat the same time. This principle, which is known as the relativity\nof simultaneity, creates serious difficulty for the A-theory in\ngeneral and for presentism in particular. After all, it follows from\nthe relativity of simultaneity that there is no fact of the matter as\nto what is present, and according to any A-theory there is an\nimportant distinction between what is present and what is merely past\nor future. According to presentism, that distinction is one of\nexistence\u2014only what is present exists.\n\nA different way of describing the relativity of simultaneity involves\nthe combination of two claims:\n\nthe claim that whether two spatially separated events happen at\nthe same time depends on the reference frame you use to describe them,\nand\nthe claim that no reference frame is privileged.\n\n\nThis way of putting the relativity of simultaneity requires a new bit\nof technical jargon: the notion of a reference frame. For our\npurposes, a reference frame is nothing more than a coordinate\nsystem that is used to identify the same point in space at different\ntimes. Someone on a steadily moving train, for instance, will\nnaturally use a reference frame that is different from someone who is\nstanding on the station platform, since it is natural for the person\non the train to think of themselves as stationary, while for the\nperson on the platform it seems obvious that they are moving.\n\nThe reason why it is worth introducing this bit of jargon is that once\nyou present the relativity of simultaneity as the combination of\nclaims (i) and (ii), you can also note that the motivation for claim\n(i) is importantly different from the motivation for claim (ii). The\nmotivation for (i) is a series of empirical results at the end of the\nnineteenth and beginning of the twentieth century, including, most\nfamously, the Michelson-Morley experiment. No one should deny this\npart of the relativity of simultaneity. The motivation for (ii), by\ncontrast, is less often explicitly discussed, and seems to involve the\ncommitment to some sort of general extra-empirical principle like\n\u201celiminate unobservable entities whenever possible\u201d, or\n\u201celiminate excess spacetime structure whenever possible\u201d.\nThis means that presentists and other A-theorists have a way of\navoiding the worry from relativity without any conflict with empirical\nresults\u2014they can reject whatever extra-empirical principle\nmotivates (ii). Whether you think the costs associated with this move\nare worth paying will depend on your degree of commitment to the\nA-theory, what exactly you think of the relevant extra-empirical\nprinciple supporting (ii), and whether that principle plays an\nimportant role elsewhere in physics.\n\nIt is often said that philosophers should defer to physics with\nrespect to what the latter says about time. But the interaction\nbetween the A-theory and special relativity illustrates one way in\nwhich that claim is more complicated than it first appears. Must\nphilosophers respect both the empirical and the\nextra-empirical aspects of our best physical theories? Or is it\nsufficient that they respect the former?\n\nAnother way in which this assumption is complicated is that different\nphysical theories often seem to imply different things about the\nnature of time. Consider, for instance, the fact that in general\nrelativity there is sometimes (though not always!) a preferred way of\n\u201cfoliating\u201d spacetime into instants of time and thus\nreintroducing a notion of absolute simultaneity, or the fact that on\nsome interpretations of quantum mechanics, the dynamical laws seem to\nrequire a notion of absolute simultaneity.\n\nTwo additional questions about the nature of time that have been\nespecially influenced by contemporary physics have to do with the\narrow of time and the extent to which time itself might be\nemergent.\n\nTo motivate the first question, start from the observation that the\norder in which events happen in time seems to matter a great deal.\nThere seems to be an important difference, for instance between a\ntrain traveling from Boston to Providence and a train traveling from\nProvidence to Boston. This is because, even though both of these\nsequences may be constituted by the very same events, those events are\nin a different order in each sequence. In the former sequence the\ntrain being in Boston happens earlier than the train being in\nProvidence. In the latter, the train being in Boston happens\nlater.\n\nThese straightforward observations show that we experience time as\nhaving a direction. This is what philosophers call \u201cthe arrow of\ntime\u201d. But is the arrow of time a fundamental feature of the\nworld? Or can it be reduced to some other feature, thus simplifying\nour metaphysics as a whole?\n\nOne way to try to eliminate the arrow of time at the fundamental level\nis to make use of certain interpretations of statistical mechanics\ninspired by Ludwig Boltzmann\u2019s work. Imagine the history of the\nuniverse as a long timeline, but with no indication of which end of\nthe time line represents the first moment of time and which end\nrepresents the last moment. It follows from certain interpretations of\nstatistical mechanics that there is a physical quantity, the\nentropy of the universe, that will be relatively low at one\nend of the timeline and relatively high at the other end and will\nalways increase as you move from the former end of the timeline to the\nlatter. (More carefully, the entropy will almost always increase or at\nleast stay constant.) The thought, then, is that we might be able to\nreduce the arrow of time to this entropy gradient. Earlier moments of\ntime are just moments of time when the entropy of the universe is\nlower.\n\nThis way of eliminating the arrow of time from the fundamental level\nis promising, but has at least some unintuitive consequences. For\ninstance, it seems natural to think that entropy could have decreased\nover time, instead of increasing over time as it actually does. But\ngiven the reduction described above, it is not in fact possible for\nentropy to decrease over time.\n\nThe second question mentioned above is a question about whether time\nitself\u2014as opposed to just some particular feature of time, like\ntime\u2019s arrow\u2014might merely be an emergent feature of the\nworld. This question has become especially pressing as philosophers of\nphysics have turned their attention to theories of quantum gravity in\nwhich there does not seem to be anything like temporal structure at\nthe fundamental level. Work in this area is nascent, but some of the\nquestions of interest include: Does quantum gravity eliminate time\nentirely or does it merely make time a non-fundamental feature of the\nworld? What would it mean for something temporal to be grounded in\nsomething atemporal and what sort of grounding relation would be\ninvolved? What is the distinction between causal structure (especially\nthe causal structure in causal set theory\u2014one approach to\nquantum gravity) and temporal structure? And how can a theory that\neliminates time entirely be empirically confirmed or disconfirmed?\n\nSuggestions for Further Reading: Albert 2000; Emery\n2019 & forthcoming; Godfrey-Smith 1979; Healey 2002; Huggett and\nW\u00fcthrich 2013; Knox 2013; Markosian 2004; Maxwell 1985; Monton\n2006; Price 1996; Putnam 1967; Rovelli 2017; Savitt 2000; Stein 1968,\n1970; Weingard 1972; W\u00fcthrich and Callender 2017.\n",
