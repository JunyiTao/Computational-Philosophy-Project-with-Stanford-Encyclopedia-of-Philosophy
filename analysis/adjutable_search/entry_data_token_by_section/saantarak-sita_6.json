Though its impact could be seen before\n\u015a\u0101ntarak\u1e63ita (in facets of Bh\u0101viveka\u2019s\nwritings), he was the first major Madhyamaka thinker who was also a\ncommentator on Dharmak\u012brti, a contributor to this discourse, and\nwho attempted to integrate its insights into a Madhyamaka framework.\n(Both Dign\u0101ga and Dharmak\u012brti are more closely associated\nwith the Mind-Only school). One can witness one dimension of the\nprofound influence \u015a\u0101ntarak\u1e63ita had on Tibetan\nBuddhist thought, even given the differences in the details, when\nobserving this integration of Madhyamaka and\npram\u0101\u1e47av\u0101da thought in towering Tibetan\nthinkers such as Sakya Pandita and Tsongkhapa among others.\n\u015a\u0101ntarak\u1e63ita\u2019s thought on logico-epistemological\nissues is primarily found in his encyclopedic doxography,\nTattvasa\u1e43graha and in his commentary on\nDharmak\u012brti\u2019s V\u0101dany\u0101ya entitled\nVipa\u00f1cit\u0101rth\u0101. In order to properly situate\n\u015a\u0101ntarak\u1e63ita\u2019s thought on these issues, it is\nnecessary to briefly discuss that of his two most important\npredecessors in this area: Dign\u0101ga and Dharmak\u012brti.\n\nCentral to the logico-epistemological tradition in general and\n\u015aantarak\u1e63ita in particular is the question of what\nconstitutes a means by which one accrues an instance of indubitable\nknowing. In other words, how does one justify considering a moment of\nawareness or cognitive episode as valid knowledge\n(pram\u0101\u1e47a)? What constitutes trustworthy awareness?\nFor \u015a\u0101ntarak\u1e63ita, the pram\u0101\u1e47a that\nis the means of justifying an instant of valid knowing is\nsimultaneously indistinct from the instant of valid knowing itself\n(McClintock 2002, 57).\n\nAs with Dharmak\u012brti, \u015a\u0101ntarak\u1e63ita describes valid\nknowledge or valid cognitions as instants of new knowledge in the\nsense that the cognizer knows newly something which to that point was\nunknown. Generally speaking, Buddhist\npram\u0101\u1e47av\u0101da thinkers categorize two types of\n\npram\u0101\u1e47a[16]:\n perception\n (pratyak\u1e63a)[17]\n and inference (anum\u0101na). Objects of perception are\ncausally efficacious particulars (svalak\u1e63a\u1e47a),\nactual instance of things in the world with temporal and spatial\nlocation. It is only particulars that are considered to be real.\nGenerally, it would be thought that words apply to universals\n(s\u0101m\u0101nyalak\u1e63a\u1e47a) which are conceptual\nconstructs that have no causal efficacy in the world. Thus the early\npram\u0101\u1e47av\u0101da thinkers like Dign\u0101ga and\nDharmak\u012brti can be considered to hold a soft form of\nconnotationism in that they would reject a denotationist view that\nconsiders words to apply directly to actual particulars. The intuition\nthat a word points to a particular would be very objectionable. A word\ncannot express a particular because particulars are limitless and\nwords have limits. Yet they are soft connotationists in that via a\nprocess of elimination or exclusion, they posit a way in which\nlanguage is both not arbitrary and not a reference to particulars.\nInferences are cognitions based on valid reasons that depend on this\nnon-arbitrary use of\n language.[18]\n\nAmong the philosophical issues that are important here is the\nfundamental question of how, if the world is only directly accessibly\nby perception, can one come to valid knowledge by means of inference\nthat relies on words that do not directly refer to particulars? How\ndoes one link the ineffable world of particulars to language, and thus\nto an inference that could produce valid knowledge? Since words do not\napply to actual objects or particulars which are ineffable,\n\u015a\u0101ntarak\u1e63ita, like his predecessors Dharmak\u012brti\nand Dign\u0101ga, needs to explain how it is that we are talking about\nthe world, while at the same time making it clear that we are not\ntalking about the world, but our conceptual scheme. Yet he also must\nmake clear that all conceptual schemes are not equal in that some can\nproduce valid knowledge and some fail to do so. There must be a degree\nof non-arbitrariness to language if inference is to be considered as a\nsource of valid knowledge. There are true and false statements and\nconsequences for beliefs about them. So the challenge is: how does one\nlink the ineffable world of particulars to language?\n\nEach of the pram\u0101\u1e47av\u0101da thinkers, including\n\u015a\u0101ntarak\u1e63ita, begin to address these questions with\nvariations on a theory initiated by Dign\u0101ga and fine-tuned by\nDharmak\u012brti and his followers, known as exclusion\n(apoha) theory. Dign\u0101ga\u2019s response to the problem\nbegins by claiming that language does not refer to universals, as one\nmight presume a Buddhist would argue, but rather, through a negative\nprocess of exclusions or apoha, eliminates that which\ncontradicts the referred object. Words talk about entities in so far\nas they are qualified by the negation of other things. Though nothing\naffirmative is said about reality, by use of exclusions, there is a\nrelationship between concepts and particulars. Apoha or\nexclusions typically involves a double negation. Because in Buddhism\nthe absence of something is a fiction in that absences are not caused\nand do not function, exclusions can be used to explain away universals\nas the referents of words. Because negations are fictions, this\nlightens the ontological commitment. A distinction is drawn between\nentities and pseudo-entities. Only particulars are real; negations are\nnot real, but they are also not universals. Universals are positive or\naffirmative, whereas exclusions are negative. Dign\u0101ga\u2019s\nposition is explained quite succinctly by Bimal Matilal:\n\nEach name, as Dign\u0101ga understands, dichotomizes the universe into\ntwo: those to which the name can be applied and those to which it\ncannot be applied. The function of a name is to exclude the object\nfrom the class of those objects to which it cannot be applied. One\nmight say that the function of a name is to locate the object outside\nof the class of those to which it cannot be applied. (Matilal 1971,\n45)\n\n\nDign\u0101ga argues for a way in which language can be construed to\nsignify particulars, through a double negation that excludes that\nwhich contradicts the referent object while eliminating the\nphilosophical commitment to universals. Though the process of\nexclusion seems quite cumbersome, in actuality our language formation\nand conceptual processes seem to engage in it quite naturally.\n\nDharmak\u012brti adds several components to the thought of\nDign\u0101ga on these issues concerning valid knowledge. In defining\nperception as a source or means of valid knowledge, Dharmak\u012brti\ndescribes it as that cognition that is free from conceptuality\nand non-erroneous. The inclusion of the qualification of it\nbeing non-erroneous eliminates erroneous non-conceptual cognitions,\nsuch as mistakenly seeing two moons, from the category of valid\nknowledge. Dharmak\u012brti further distinguishes two ways of\napprehending objects: through perceptions which apprehend real objects\npositively, as they are, through the mediation of images\n(\u0101k\u0101ra) which perfectly reflect them, and through\nconcepts which get at their objects negatively, through the\nelimination of their opposites. Dharmak\u012brti\u2019s insight is\nfound in the connection he draws between reality and the conceptual\nrealm of universals. For Dharmak\u012brti, experience and\nrepresentations are the bridge. We construct concepts out of our\nexperiences and representations of functional resemblances of real\nentities. In other words, we can validly group together\nrepresentations of actually unique entities on the basis that they can\nbe excluded from the class of things that do not perform a given\nfunction. Georges Dreyfus put it well:\n\nFor Dharmak\u012brti, the conceptual process is neither arbitrary nor\ngroundless, even though it does not reflect reality. Conceptuality\ndoes not arise out of nothing but results from experience. As we may\nrecall, things such as trees, for instance, have functional\nsimilarities. In dependence on our experiences in which the functional\nresemblances of things are registered, we construct concepts. Thus,\nconceptuality arises as a result of our experiences. In this way\nconceptual thoughts are connected indirectly to reality. (Dreyfus\n1997, 226)\n\n\nIn other words, there are several components to\nDharmak\u012brti\u2019s exclusion theory: the entity or particular,\nthe image or representation, and the exclusion. First there are real\nevents of real entities. Then there is a perception that has the mark\nof a real entity because it is caused by something real. It is a\nmirror-like image of the real. This is followed by a conceptual\nrepresentation superimposed on a real image. This is part real, part\nconcept. Finally, after this is done, there is an assumption of\ncommonality with other conceptual representations. This assumption is\nunreal and is the basis of the exclusion or universal. It derives not\nfrom the reality of common characteristics, but judgments of\nsimilarity. This is where concepts are conceived of as representing\nproperties that are thought to exist in the world, such as permanence,\nwhich in fact do not. But it is through this process of exclusion that\none can utilize positive language with the understanding that that\nlanguage only refers to a common negation.\n\n\u015a\u0101ntarak\u1e63ita\u2019s treatment of these issues largely\nrevolves around a response to the criticisms found in such\nnon-Buddhist thinkers as Kum\u0101rila (ca. 600\u2013660) and\nUddyotakara (fl. 525). Kum\u0101rila levels three criticisms\nof apoha theory in particular: that it is circular, that it\nis counter-intuitive, and that it is redundant.\n\u015a\u0101ntarak\u1e63ita\u2019s response to these criticisms\nbegins by describing three primary types of negations which he equates\nwith exclusions: non-implicative negations (Skt.\nprasajyaprati\u1e63edha, Tib. med dgag) and two\ntypes of implicative negations (Skt.\nparyud\u0101saprati\u1e63edha, Tib. ma yin dgag):\nmental exclusions and object exclusions. A non-implicative negation is\na negation that does not imply the existence of some other thing. For\nexample, the negation of the existence of flowers that grows in the\nsky does not imply the existence of other plants that grow in the sky.\nIt is a mere negation with nothing implied. On the other hand,\nimplicative negations, while denying the existence of one thing, imply\nthe existence of another. An example of an implicative negation would\nbe if we were told that either my aunt or my uncle came over last\nnight. If my aunt did not come, it implies that my uncle did. Thus,\nthere is something implied by the negation. Among the types of\nimplicative negations, \u015a\u0101ntarak\u1e63ita includes mental\nexclusions. It is important to point out here that for\n\u015a\u0101ntarak\u1e63ita, negations and exclusions are virtually\nsynonymous. Mental exclusions are conceptual representations that\nrelate to the appearances or representations of entities, as discussed\nby Dign\u0101ga. Object exclusions are not conceptual representations\nof mere appearances or representations, but rather can relate to the\nreal world. Thus, this form of exclusion is a real thing for\n\u015a\u0101ntarak\u1e63ita. It is these three types of exclusions\nthat form the basis of \u015a\u0101ntarak\u1e63ita\u2019s thought on\nthis topic, the basis of his psychological interpretation of\napoha, and the basis of his response to the critics of\nDharmak\u012briti\u2019s apoha theory, such as\nKum\u0101rila.\n\nIn addition to the three types of exclusions, central to\n\u015a\u0101ntarak\u1e63ita\u2019s thought on the topic is his\nunique presentation of representations and the psychological\ndimensions to his exclusion\n theory.[19]\n According to \u015a\u0101ntarak\u1e63ita, it is our experiences of\nunifying similarities among representations that gives rise to our\nconceptual constructs. Mental representations of objects are\nexclusions because they exclude other representations. These\nconceptual representations are misconstrued to be the actual objects\nsince the actual objects do not exist in them. For\n\u015a\u0101ntarak\u1e63ita, both the exclusion of that which is\nother than real particular and the exclusion of that which is other\nthan the representation are both apohas or exclusions. The\npsychological dimension to exclusion is particularly important in\n\u015a\u0101ntarak\u1e63ita\u2019s apoha theory in that he\nemphasizes the role of negation in relation to mental representations\nand mental events in the conceptualizing process. For\nDharmak\u012brti, universals are the objects of concepts.\n\u015a\u0101ntarak\u1e63ita agrees with this point but stresses that\nthe concept is the mental representation or mental event and that is\nan exclusion, whereas for Dharmak\u012brti the representations are the\nbasis which supports the exclusions and concepts. For\nDharmak\u012brti, exclusions are conceptual fictions, whereas for\n\u015a\u0101ntarak\u1e63ita they can be real entities.\n\n\u015a\u0101ntarak\u1e63ita considers that he is fully able to\nrespond to the criticisms of Kum\u0101rila with his presentation of\nexclusions. For example, Kum\u0101rila charges that the Buddhist\napoha theories are counter-intuitive in that our intuition is\nnot that words and concepts refer to negations or exclusions.\n\u015a\u0101ntarak\u1e63ita argues that Kum\u0101rila misunderstands\napoha to always be non-implicative negations. He misses the\ntwo types of implicative negations that \u015a\u0101ntarak\u1e63ita\nclearly specifies as included among forms of exclusions. For\n\u015a\u0101ntarak\u1e63ita, when we use words, the objects of such\nconceptual thoughts are the real objects. They are the indirect object\nof the exclusion that is a form of implicative negation, which\nincludes negative aspects by implication. Thus, words can be\nindicative of positive elements. The external object implies the image\nplus the exclusion of that which is other. The words or concepts thus\ntake external objects as their objects and imply the conceptual\nexclusions. Thus when Kum\u0101rila mistakes all exclusions to be\nnon-implicative negations, he misses this key component to the\npsychological functions at work and mistakes apoha theory to\nbe counter-intuitive.\n\nKum\u0101rila\u2019s charge of circularity in apoha theory\nis one of the most critical for its defenders to answer. The main\nthrust of the argument was already found in Uddyotakara\u2019s\nNy\u0101yav\u0101rttika, where he argues that apoha\nentails the problems of circularity and denotationism (which\napoha theorists consider it is imperative to avoid). This is\nthe case because there must be an affirmative denotation between words\nand particulars since the negation of an object implies that one first\nhave a positive understanding of the object. One must first have an\naffirmative understanding before one can negate its exclusion. Dreyfus\nsummarizes Kum\u0101rila\u2019s presentation of the argument\nsuccinctly as follows:\n\nIf conceptual understanding involves negation of x, then\nunderstanding of x will presuppose that of non-x,\nwhich in turn presupposes that of non-non-x. And this is\nnothing but an understanding of x. (Dreyfus 1997, 242)\n\n\nIn other words, Kum\u0101rila argues that since a conceptual\nunderstanding of a cow is simply an understanding of non-non-cow\naccording to apoha theory, that in order to understand\nnon-non-cow, one must already understand cow. Thus, apoha\ntheory must resort to circularity, or perhaps even more precisely, it\nlacks a beginning point for the circle in the first place. Uddyotakara\nemphasizes that the only way out is to resort to a linguistic\ndenotationism that apoha theorists want to avoid.\nKum\u0101rila stresses the interdependence of knowing cow and knowing\nnon-cow and not non-cow. Both question how a double negation is\nsomething other than a positive universal.\n\nThe crux of \u015a\u0101ntarak\u1e63ita\u2019s response, again,\nrelies on his presentation of three types of exclusions, specifically\nthe mental exclusion that is signified by words, a point he feels both\nUddyotakara and Kum\u0101rila fail to recognize. According to\n\u015a\u0101ntarak\u1e63ita, there is a conceptual image that is an\nexclusion that is generated in the mind of one who hears the words,\n\u201cThis animal is a cow,\u201d for example, but that this idea is\nan implicative negation that only implies that this animal is not a\nnon-cow. According to \u015a\u0101ntarak\u1e63ita, the problem of\ncircularity is thus avoided by a proper understanding of implicative\nnegations: to understand cow one need not understand non-cow, but\nrather the mere idea of cow. Like Dharmak\u012brti,\n\u015a\u0101ntarak\u1e63ita relies on a judgment of similarity in\nfunctional efficacy among distinct particulars as conceptually\nconstrued to generate the idea. For \u015a\u0101ntarak\u1e63ita the\nemphasis is on similarity among the mental representations of them.\n\u015a\u0101ntarak\u1e63ita and Dharmak\u012brti both argue that\nthere is not a problem with grouping things as x and\nnon-x. The distinction between similar and dissimilar classes\nis made and the word merely applied to indicate this understood\ndistinction. For \u015a\u0101ntarak\u1e63ita, based on judgments of\nsimilarity, the classes of cows and non-cows are established. It is\nthe word that is applied to them which is not established. It is the\nword that is used to indicate this judgment of similarity at the\ndiscretion of the speaker. Thus, for \u015a\u0101ntarak\u1e63ita, the\nperceived problem of circularity by Uddyotakara and Kum\u0101rila is\ndue to their misunderstanding of exclusions and negations.\n\n\u015a\u0101ntarak\u1e63ita\u2019s response to Hindu critics of\napoha and the interpretive innovations that spring from it\nrepresent a critical juncture in Buddhist logico-epistemological\nthought. Though we see examples of integration of\npram\u0101\u1e47av\u0101da thinking into the ideas of a\nM\u0101dhyamika philosopher, most notably with Bh\u0101viveka, it is\nnot until \u015a\u0101ntarak\u1e63ita that we see this marriage of\nideas fully integrated and spelled out in a sophisticated way. It is\ndifficult to overstate the tremendous impact this marriage of two\nmajor strands of late Indian philosophical thought in\n\u015a\u0101ntarak\u1e63ita had on the philosophical traditions of\nTibet.\n",
