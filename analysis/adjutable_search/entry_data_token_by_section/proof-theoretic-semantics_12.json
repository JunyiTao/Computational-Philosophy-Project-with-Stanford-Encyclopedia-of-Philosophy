    "main_text": "Extensions and alternatives to standard proof-theoretic semantics || Negation and denial\n3.2 Negation and denial\n\nStandard proof-theoretic semantics is assertion-centred in that\nassertibility conditions determine the meaning of logical constants.\nCorresponding to the intuitionistic way of proceeding, the negation\n\\(\\neg A\\) of a formula \\(A\\) is normally understood as implying\nabsurdity \\(A \\rightarrow \\bot\\), where \\(\\bot\\) is a constant which\ncannot be asserted, i.e., for which no assertibility condition is\ndefined. This is an \u2018indirect\u2019 way of understanding\nnegation. In the literature there has been the discussion of what,\nfollowing von Kutschera (1969), might be called \u2018direct\u2019\nnegation. By that one understands a one-place primitive operator of\nnegation, which cannot be, or at least is not, reduced to implying\nabsurdity. It is not classical negation either. It rather obeys rules\nwhich dualize the usual rules for the logical constants. Sometimes it\nis called the \u201cdenial\u201d of a sentence, sometimes also\n\u201cstrong negation\u201d (see Odintsov, 2008). Typical rules for\nthe denial \\({\\sim}A\\) of \\(A\\) are \n\\[\n\\begin{prooftree}\n\\AxiomC{${\\sim}A$}\n\\AxiomC{${\\sim}B$}\n\\BinaryInfC{${\\sim}(A \\lor B)$}\n\\end{prooftree}\n\\hspace{1.5em}\n\\begin{prooftree}\n\\AxiomC{${\\sim}A$}\n\\UnaryInfC{${\\sim}(A \\land B)$}\n\\end{prooftree}\n\\hspace{1.5em}\n\\begin{prooftree}\n\\AxiomC{${\\sim}B$}\n\\UnaryInfC{${\\sim}(A \\land B)$}\n\\end{prooftree}\n\\]\n\n\nEssentially, the denial rules for an operator correspond to the\nassertion rules for the dual operator. Several logics of denial have\nbeen investigated, in particular Nelson\u2019s (1949) logics of\n\u201cconstructible falsity\u201d motivated by Nelson with respect\nto a certain realizability semantics. The main focus has been on his\nsystems later called N3 and N4 which differ with respect to the\ntreatment of contradiction (N4 is N3 without ex contradictione\nquodlibet). Using denial any approach to proof-theoretic\nsemantics can be dualized by just exchanging assertion and denial and\nturning from logical constants to their duals. In doing so, one\nobtains a system based on refutation \\((=\\) proof of denial) rather\nthan proof. It can be understood as applying a Popperian view to\nproof-theoretic semantics by keeping its intuitionistic spirit.\nFormally, it leads to systems such as dual intuitionistic logic by\ngiving them a proof-theoretic semantics.\n\nAnother approach would be to not just dualize assertion-centered\nproof-theoretic semantics in favour of a denial-centered\nrefutation-theoretic semantics, but to see the relation between rules\nfor assertion and for denial as governed by an inversion principle or\nprinciple of definitional reflection of its own. This would be a\nprinciple of what might be called\n\u201cassertion-denial-harmony\u201d. Whereas in standard\nproof-theoretic semantics, inversion principles control the\nrelationship between assertions and assumptions (or consequences),\nsuch a principle would now regulate the relationship between assertion\nand denial. Given certain defining conditions of \\(A\\), it would say\nthat the denial of every defining condition of \\(A\\) leads to the\ndenial of \\(A\\) itself. For conjunction and disjunction this leads to\nthe common pairs of assertion and denial rules \n\\[\n\\begin{prooftree}\n\\AxiomC{$A$}\n\\UnaryInfC{$A \\lor B$}\n\\end{prooftree}\n\\hspace{1.5em}\n\\begin{prooftree}\n\\AxiomC{$B$}\n\\UnaryInfC{$A \\lor B$}\n\\end{prooftree}\n\\hspace{1.5em}\n\\begin{prooftree}\n\\AxiomC{${\\sim}A$}\n\\AxiomC{${\\sim}B$}\n\\BinaryInfC{${\\sim}(A \\lor B)$}\n\\end{prooftree}\n\\]\n\n\\[\n\\begin{prooftree}\n\\AxiomC{$A$}\n\\AxiomC{$B$}\n\\BinaryInfC{$A \\land B$}\n\\end{prooftree}\n\\hspace{1.5em}\n\\begin{prooftree}\n\\AxiomC{${\\sim}A$}\n\\UnaryInfC{${\\sim}(A \\land B)$}\n\\end{prooftree}\n\\hspace{1.5em}\n\\begin{prooftree}\n\\AxiomC{${\\sim}B$}\n\\UnaryInfC{${\\sim}(A \\land B)$}\n\\end{prooftree}\n\\]\n\n\nThis idea can easily be generalized to definitional reflection,\nyielding a reasoning system in which assertion and denial are\nintertwined. It has parallels to the deductive relations between the\nforms of judgement studied in the traditional square of opposition\n(Schroeder-Heister, 2012a; Zeilberger, 2008). It should be emphasized\nthat the denial operator is here an external sign indicating a form of\njudgement and not a logical operator. This means in particular that it\ncannot be iterated.\n\nThe idea that both assertion and denial conditions give meaning to a\nsentence and thus to logical operations also figures under the term\n\u201cbilateralism\u201d, a term coined by Rumfitt.\n\nFurther Reading\n\nFor the proof-theoretic semantics of negation and denial see\nTranchini (2012b), Wansing (2001; 2017), as well as the special issue\non assertion and denial edited by Carrara, Chiffi and De\nFlorio (2017) and the entry on\n negation,\n the entry on\n connexive logic\n and the entry on\n contradiction.\n\nFor the idea of bilateralism see Rumfitt (2000), K\u00fcrbis (2016;\n2019), Drobyshevich (2021) and the special issue on bilateralism\nand proof-theoretic semantics edited by Sara Ayhan (2023).\n\nFor Popperianism and proof theoretic semantics see Binder et al.\n(2022), Kapsner (2014).\n",
