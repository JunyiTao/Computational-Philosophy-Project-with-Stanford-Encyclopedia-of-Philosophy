    "main_text": "Stating the Question\n1. Stating the Question\n\nThe main question we will address in this article is: Does God\nground the existence of necessarily existing abstract\nobjects? It is perhaps a more general question than a question one\nmight at first ask: Did God create necessarily existing abstracta? But\nit is the main question that philosophers who have written about the\nrelation between God and abstract objects have sought to answer.\n\nOver the last two decades, philosophers have done a great deal of work\non the notion of grounding (see, e.g., Fine 2001, Rosen 2010, Audi\n2012, Schaffer 2009 Koslicki 2012 and the Stanford Encyclopedia entry\non\n grounding).\n It is thought by many currently working on issues in the metaphysics\nof grounding that grounding is a primitive, sui generis\nrelation. In particular, it is not to be understood as a supervenience\nor causal relation. How are we then to understand what it is?\nPhilosophers point to particular cases where it is instanced:\nDispositional properties are grounded in categorical properties, the\nmental is grounded in the physical, the semantic is grounded in the\nnon-semantic, features like smiles or surfaces are grounded in facts\nabout bodies, and so on. To this point, one might think that grounding\ntalk can be captured by our ordinary notion of\n supervenience.[3]\n But Fine (2001) claims that Socrates\u2019 singleton set is grounded\nin Socrates; yet, necessarily one exists just if the other does. Thus\nour ordinary modal notion of supervenience won\u2019t capture this\ncase of grounding. If we assume (as many in the grounding literature\ndo) that the other cases of grounding are of the same sort as the\nSocrates-singleton case is, then our ordinary notion of supervenience\nwon\u2019t capture them either. \n\nOur discussion of the question of God\u2019s grounding the existence\nof necessarily existing abstracta bears on the general conversation\nabout the nature of grounding. First, we can note that our\ndivine grounding case stands alongside the Socrates-singleton case in\nshowing that ordinary supervenience won\u2019t capture the grounding\nrelationship properly. For instance, suppose we say that God grounds\nthe existence of the number 2. We then can note that, necessarily God\nexists just if 2 does (that is, each exist in every possible world).\nAccording to ordinary notions of supervenience, the number 2\nsupervenes on God, and conversely. But we are to think that God\ngrounds the existence of 2, and not vice versa. Second, we\nhave here in the case of divine grounding of abstracta a case where\nthe grounding relationship is typically spelled out in other,\nfamiliar terms (and thus isn\u2019t sui generis). As we will\nsee, a number of different philosophers who think that God grounds the\nexistence of necessarily existing abstract objects think that God does\nso in a causal manner. Others think that the grounding takes\nplace in that necessarily existing abstracta are identical\nwith divine mental states. \n\nOne might look at those who claim that God causes necessarily existing\nabstract objects or that they are identical with divine mental states\nas not asserting that God grounds the existence of necessarily\nexisting abstracta. But as we will see, each of these sorts of\ntheorists really is saying that God grounds the existence of\nnecessarily existing abstract objects. Thus, it might be better to cast our\nlot with those who are skeptical that there is a sui generis\ngrounding relationship that metaphysicians investigate. Or, if there\nis such a relationship in some cases of grounding, it isn\u2019t\npresent in all cases of grounding (it isn\u2019t\n\u201cunivocal\u201d\u2014see Hofweber 2009 and Daly 2012 for\ndiscussion). After all, it is perfectly sensible to recast \u201cDo\nnecessarily existing abstract objects depend on God?\u201d as\n\u201cAre necessarily existing abstract objects grounded in\nGod?\u201d\n\nHowever we think of the dependence relationship between God and\nnecessarily existing abstract objects, we will want to insist that on\nit God is somehow more fundamental than necessarily existing abstract\nobjects.\n Fundamentality (Stanford Encyclopedia entry)\n is an asymmetric relationship. Thus we will construe those who think\nthat God grounds the existence of necessarily existing abstracta as\nclaiming that God is more fundamental than necessarily existing\nabstracta, and not conversely. \n",
