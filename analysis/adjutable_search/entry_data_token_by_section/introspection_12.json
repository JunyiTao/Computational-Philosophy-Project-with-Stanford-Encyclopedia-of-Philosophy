    "main_text": "The Accuracy of Introspection || Varieties of Privilege\n4.1 Varieties of Privilege\n\nIt\u2019s plausible to suppose that people have some sort of\nprivileged access to at least some of their own mental states\nor processes: You know about your own mind, or at least some aspects\nof it, in a different way and better than you know about other\npeople\u2019s minds, and maybe also in a different way and better\nthan you know about the outside world. Consider pain. It seems you\nknow your own pains differently and better than you know mine,\ndifferently and (perhaps) better than you know about the coffee cup in\nyour hand. If so, perhaps that special \u201cfirst-person\u201d\nprivileged knowledge arises through something like introspection, in\none or more of the senses described in Section 2 above.\n\nJust as there is a diversity of methods for acquiring knowledge of or\nreaching judgments about one\u2019s own mental states and processes,\nto which the label \u201cintrospection\u201d applies with more or\nless or disputable accuracy, so also is there a diversity of forms of\n\u201cprivileged access\u201d, with different kinds of privilege and\nto which the idea of access applies with more or less or disputable\naccuracy. And as one might expect, the different introspective methods\ndo not all align equally well with the different varieties of\nprivilege.\n4.1.1 Varieties of Perfection: Infallibility, Indubitability, Incorrigibility, and Self-Intimation\n\nA substantial philosophical tradition, going back at least to\nDescartes (1637/1985; 1641/1984; also Augustine c. 420 C.E./1998),\nascribes a kind of epistemic perfection to at least some of our\njudgments (or thoughts or beliefs or knowledge) about our own\nminds\u2014infallibility, indubitability, incorrigibility, or\nself-intimation. Consider the judgment (thought, belief, etc.) that\nP, where P is a proposition self-ascribing a mental\nstate or process (for example P might be I am in\npain, or I believe that it is snowing, or I am\nthinking of a dachshund). The judgment that P is\ninfallible just in case, if I make that judgment, it is not\npossible that P is false. It is indubitable just in\ncase, if I make the judgment, it is not possible for me to doubt the\ntruth of P. It is incorrigible just in case, if I\nmake the judgment, it is not possible for anyone else to show that\nP is false. And it is self-intimating if it is not\npossible for P to be true without my reaching the judgment\n(thought, belief, etc.) that it is true. Note that the direction of\nimplication for the last of these is the reverse of the first three.\nInfallibility, indubitability, and incorrigibility all have the form:\n\u201cIf I judge (think, believe, etc.) that P, then\n\u2026\u201d, while self-intimation has the form \u201cIf\nP, then I judge (think, believe, etc.) that\nP\u201d. All four theses also admit of weakening by adding\nconditions to the antecedent \u201cif\u201d clause (e.g., \u201cIf\nI judge that P as a result of normal introspective processes,\nthen \u2026\u201d). (See Alston 1971 for a helpful dissection of\nthese distinctions; all admit of variations and nuance. Also note that\nsome philosophers [e.g. Ayer 1936/1946; Armstrong 1963; Chalmers 2003;\nTye 2009] use \u201cincorrigibility\u201d to mean infallibility as\ndefined here, while others [e.g., Ayer 1963; Alston 1971; Rorty 1970;\nDennett 2000] use it with the more etymologically specific meaning of\n[something like] \u201cincapable of correction\u201d.)\n\nDescartes (1641/1984) famously endorsed the indubitability of \u201cI\nthink\u201d, which he extends also to such mental states as doubting,\nunderstanding, affirming, and seeming to have sensory perceptions. He\nalso appears to claim that the thought or affirmation that I am in\nsuch states is infallibly true, at least if that thought is clear and\ndistinct. He was followed in this\u2014especially in his\ninfallibilism\u2014by Locke (1690 [1975]), Hume (1739 [1978]),\ntwentieth-century thinkers such as Husserl (1913 [1982]), Ayer (1936\n[1946], 1963), Lewis (1946), and the early Shoemaker (1963), and many\nothers. Historical arguments for indubitability and infallibility have\ntended to center on intuitive appeals to the apparent impossibility of\ndoubting or going wrong about such matters as whether one is having a\nthought with a certain content or is experiencing pain or having a\nvisual experience as of seeing red.\n\nRecent infallibilists have added to this intuitive appeal structural\narguments based on self-fulfillment accounts of introspection or\nself-knowledge (see Section 2.3.1 above)\u2014generally while also\nnarrowing the scope of infallibility, for example to thoughts about\nthoughts (Burge 1988, 1996), or to \u201cpure\u201d phenomenal\njudgments about consciousness (Chalmers 2003; see also Wright 1998;\nGertler 2001; Horgan, Tienson, and Graham 2006; Horgan and Kriegel\n2007; Tye 2009; with important predecessors in Brentano 1874 [1973];\nHusserl 1913 [1982]), or to beliefs as \u201ccommitments\u201d\n(Coliva 2016). The intuitive idea behind most of these structural\narguments is that somehow the self-ascriptive thought or judgment\ncontains the mental state or process self-ascribed: the\nthought that I am thinking of a pink elephant contains the thought of\na pink elephant; the judgment that I am having a visual experience of\nredness contains the red experience itself.\n\nIn contrast, self/other parity (Section 2.1) and self-detection\n(Section 2.2) accounts of introspection or self-knowledge appear to\nstand in tension with infallibilism. If introspection or\nself-knowledge involves a causal process from a mental state to an\nontologically distinct self-ascription of that state, it appears that,\nhowever reliable such a process may generally be, there is inevitably\nroom in principle for interference and error. Minimally, it seems,\nstroke, quantum accident, or clever neurosurgery could break otherwise\ngenerally reliable relationships between target mental states and the\nself-ascriptions of those states. Similar considerations apply to\nself-shaping (Section 2.3.2) and expressivist (Section 2.3.3)\naccounts, to the extent that these are interpreted causally rather\nthan constitutively.\n\nIntrospective incorrigibility, as opposed to either infallibility or\nindubitability, was held by Rorty (1970) to be \u201cthe mark of the\nmental\u201d\u2014and thus as applying to a wide range of mental\nstates\u2014. Dennett (2000, 2002) defends a similar view, for\nconscious experiences. The idea behind incorrigibility, recall, is\nthat no one else could show your self-ascriptions to be false; or we\nmight say, more qualifiedly and a bit differently, that if you arrive\nat the right kind of self-ascriptive judgment (perhaps an\nintrospectively based judgment about a currently ongoing conscious\nprocess that survives critical reflection), then no one else, perhaps\nnot even you in the future, aware of this, can rationally hold that\njudgment to be mistaken. If I judge that right now I am in severe\npain, and I do so as a result of considering introspectively whether I\nam indeed in such pain (as opposed to, say, merely inferring that I am\nin pain based on outward behavior), and if I pause to think carefully\nabout whether I really am in pain and conclude that I indeed am, then\nno one else who is aware of this can rationally believe that I\u2019m\nnot in pain, regardless of what my outward behavior might be (say,\ncalm and relaxed) or what shows up in the course of brain imaging\n(say, no activation in brain centers normally associated with pain).\n\n\nIncorrigibility does not imply infallibility: I may not actually be in\npain, even if no one could show that I\u2019m not.\nConsequently, incorrigibility is compatible with a broader array of\nsources of self-knowledge than is infallibility. Neither Rorty nor\nDennett, for example, appear to defend incorrigibility by appeal to\nself-fulfillment accounts of introspection (though in both cases,\ninterpreting their positive accounts is difficult). Causal accounts of\nself-knowledge may be compatible with incorrigibility if the causal\nconnections underwriting the incorrigible judgments are vastly more\ntrustworthy than judgments obtained without the benefit of this sort\nof privileged access. Of course, unless one embraces a strict\nself-fulfillment account, with its attendant infallibilism, one will\nwant to rule out abnormal cases such as quantum accident; hence the\nneed for qualifications.\n\nSelf-intimating mental states are those such that, if a person (or at\nleast a person with the right background capacities) has them, she\nnecessarily believes or judges or knows that she does. Conscious\nstates are often held to be in some sense self-intimating, in that the\nmere having of them involves, requires, or implies some sort of\nrepresentation or awareness of those states. Brentano argues that\nconsciousness, for example, of an outward stimulus like a sound,\n\u201cclearly occurs together with consciousness of this\nconsciousness\u201d, that is, the consciousness is \u201cof the\nwhole mental act in which the sound is presented and in which the\nconsciousness itself exists concomitantly\u201d (1874 [1995, 129];\nsee also\n phenomenological approaches to self-consciousness).\n \u201cHigher order\u201d and \u201csame order\u201d theories of\nconsciousness (Armstrong 1968; Rosenthal 1990, 2005; Gennaro 1996;\nLycan 1996; Carruthers 2005; Kriegel 2009; see also\n higher-order theories of consciousness)\n explain consciousness in terms of some thought, perception, or\nrepresentation of the mental state that is conscious\u2014the\npresence of that thought, perception, or representation being what\nmakes the target state conscious. (On same order theories, the target\nmental state, or an aspect of it, represents itself, with no need for\na distinct higher order state.) Thus, Horgan, Kriegel, and others have\ndescribed consciousness as \u201cself-presenting\u201d (Horgan,\nTienson, and Graham 2005; Horgan and Kriegel 2007; the usage appears\nto follow Chisholm 1981, but Chisholm actually has an indubitability\nrather than a self-intimation thesis in mind). Shoemaker (1995, 2012)\nargues that beliefs\u2014as long as they are \u201cavailable\u201d\n(i.e., readily deployed in inference, assent, practical reasoning,\netc.), which needn\u2019t require that they are occurrently\nconscious\u2014are self-intimating for individuals with sufficient\ncognitive capacity. Shoemaker\u2019s idea is that if the belief that\nP is available in the relevant sense, then one is disposed to\ndo things like say \u201cI believe P\u201d, and such\ndispositions are themselves constitutive of believing that one\nbelieves that P.\n\nSelf-intimation claims (unlike infallibility, indubitability, and\nincorrigibility claims) are not usually cast as claims about\n\u201cintrospection\u201d. This may be because knowledge acquired\nthrough self-intimation would appear to be constant and automatic,\nthus violating the effort condition on introspection (condition 6 in\nSection 1.1 above).\n4.1.2 Weaker Guarantees\n\nA number of philosophers have argued for forms of first-person\nprivilege involving some sort of epistemic guarantee\u2014not just\nconditional accuracy as a matter of empirical fact, but something more\nrobust than that\u2014without embracing infallibility,\nindubitability, incorrigibility, or self-intimation in the senses\ndescribed in Section 4.1.1 above.\n\nShoemaker (1968), for example, argues that self-knowledge of certain\npsychological facts such as \u201cI am waving my arm\u201d or\n\u201cI see a canary\u201d, when arrived at \u201cin the ordinary\nway (without the aid of mirrors, etc.)\u201d, is immune to error\nthrough misidentification relative to the first-person pronoun\n(see also Campbell 1999; Pryor 1999; Bar-On 2004; Hamilton 2008). That\nis, although one may be wrong about waving one\u2019s arm (perhaps\nthe nerves to your arm were recently severed unbeknownst to you) or\nabout seeing a canary (perhaps it\u2019s a goldfinch), one cannot be\nwrong due to mistakenly identifying the person waving the arm or\nseeing the canary as you, when in fact it is someone else.\nThis immunity arises, Shoemaker argues, because there is no need for\nidentification in the first place, and thus no opportunity for\nmis-identification. In this respect, Shoemaker argues,\nknowledge that a particular arm that is moving is your arm (not immune\nto misidentification since maybe it\u2019s someone else\u2019s arm,\nmisidentified in the mirror) is different from the knowledge that\nyou are moving your arm\u2014knowledge, that is, of what\nSearle (1983) calls an \u201cintention in action\u201d.\n\nShoemaker has also argued for the conceptual impossibility of\nintrospective self-blindness with respect to one\u2019s\nbeliefs, desires, and intentions, and for somewhat different reasons\none\u2019s pains (1988, 1994b). A self-blind creature, by\nShoemaker\u2019s definition, would be a rational creature with a\nconception of the relevant mental states, and who can entertain the\nthought that she has this or that belief, desire, intention, or pain,\nbut who nonetheless utterly lacks introspective access to the type of\nmental state in question. A self-blind creature could still gain\n\u201cthird person\u201d knowledge of the mental states in question,\nthrough observing her own behavior, reading textbooks, and the like.\n(Thus, strict self/other parity accounts of self-knowledge of the sort\ndescribed in Section 2.1 are accounts according to which one is\nself-blind in Shoemaker\u2019s sense.) Shoemaker\u2019s case against\nself-blindness with respect to belief turns on the dilemma of whether\nthe self-blind creature can avoid \u201cMoore-paradoxical\u201d\nsentences (see Moore 1942, 1944 [1993]; Shoemaker 1995) like\n\u201cit\u2019s raining but I don\u2019t believe that it\u2019s\nraining\u201d in which the subject asserts both P and that\nshe doesn\u2019t believe that P. If the subject is truly\nself-blind, Shoemaker suggests, there should be cases in which her\nbest evidence is both that P and that she doesn\u2019t\nbelieve that P (the latter, perhaps, based on misleading\nfacts about her behavior). But if the subject asserts\n\u201cP but I don\u2019t believe that P\u201d in\nsuch cases, she does not (contra the initial supposition) really have\na rational command of the nature of belief and assertion; and thus\nit\u2019s not a genuine case of self-blindness as originally\nintended. Alternatively, perhaps the creature can reliably avoid such\nMoore-paradoxical sentences, self-attributing belief in an apparently\nnormal way. But then, Shoemaker suggests, it seems that she is\nindistinguishable from normal people in thought and behavior and hence\nnot self-blind. For desire, intention, and pain, too, Shoemaker aims\nto reveal incoherences between having a rational command of the\nconcepts in question and behaving as though one were systematically\nignorant of or mistaken about those states. Shoemaker uses his case\nagainst self-blindness as part of his argument against self-detection\naccounts of introspection (described in Section 2.2 above): If\nintrospection were a matter of detecting the presence of states that\nexist independently of the introspective judgment or belief, then it\nought to be possible for the faculty enabling the detection to break\ndown entirely, as in the case of blindness, deafness, etc., in outward\nperception (see also Nichols and Stich 2003, who argue that\nschizophrenia provides such a case).\n\nBurge has influentially asserted that brute errors about\n\u201cpresent, ordinary, accessible propositional attitudes [such as\nbelief and desire]\u201d are impossible or at least subject to\n\u201csevere limits\u201d\u2014where a \u201cbrute error\u201d is\nan error that \u201cindicates no rational failure and no malfunction\nin the mistaken individual\u201d such as commonly occur in ordinary\nperception due to \u201cmisleading natural conditions or look-alike\nsubstitutes\u201d (1988, 657\u2013658; 1996, 103\u2013104).\nHowever, Burge offers little argument for this claim, apart from the\nargument mentioned in Sections 2.3.1 and 4.1.1 above that for certain\nsorts of self-ascriptions error in general (and not just \u201cbrute\nerror\u201d) is impossible, due to the \u201cself-verifying\u201d\nnature of such self-ascriptions.\n\nDretske (1995, 2004) argues that we have infallible knowledge of the\ncontent of our attitudes without necessarily knowing (or even\nhaving a very good idea about) the attitude we take toward\nthose contents. For example, if I believe that it will rain\ntomorrow, I have infallibly accurate information, which I may\nthen access introspectively, regarding the presence of a mental state\nwith a certain content\u2014the content \u201cit will rain\ntomorrow\u201d\u2014but I may often have little or no information\nabout the fact that my attitude toward that content is the particular\nattitude it is\u2014belief, in this case (as opposed to supposition\nor hope). This view follows from Dretske\u2019s accepting something\nlike a containment account of the introspection of the content of the\nattitude (the introspective judgment employing the same content as the\ntarget attitude; see Section 2.3.1 above, especially the discussion of\nBurge), while he sees knowledge of the attitude one has toward that\ncontent as requiring complex information about the causal role and\nhistory of that mental state.\n\nTranscendental arguments for the accuracy of certain sorts of\nself-knowledge offer a different sort of epistemic\nguarantee\u2014\u201ctranscendental arguments\u201d being arguments\nthat assume the existence of some sort of experience or capacity, then\ndevelop insights about the background conditions necessary for that\nexperience or capacity, and finally conclude that those background\nconditions must in fact be met. Burge (1996; see also Shoemaker 1988)\nargues that to be capable of \u201ccritical reasoning\u201d one must\nbe able to recognize one\u2019s own attitudes, knowledgeably\nevaluating, identifying, and reviewing one\u2019s beliefs, desires,\ncommitments, suppositions, etc., where these mental states are known\nto be the states they are. Since we are (by assumption, for the sake\nof transcendental argument) capable of critical reasoning, we must\nhave some knowledge of our attitudes. Bilgrami (2006) argues that we\ncan only be held responsible for actions if we know the beliefs and\ndesires that \u201crationalize\u201d our actions; since we can (by\nassumption) sometimes be held responsible, we must sometimes know our\nbeliefs and desires. Wright (1989) argues that the \u201clanguage\ngame\u201d of ascribing \u201cintentional states\u201d such as\nbelief and desire to oneself and others requires as a background\ncondition that self-ascriptions have special authority within that\ngame. Given that we successfully play this language game, we must\nindeed have the special authority that we assume and others grant us\nin the context of the game.\n4.1.3 Privilege Without Guarantee\n\nDeveloping an analogy from Wright (1998), if it\u2019s your turn with\nthe kaleidoscope, you have a type of privileged perspective on the\nshapes and colors it presents. If someone else in the room wants to\nknow what color dominates, for example, the most straightforward\ncourse would be to ask you. But this type of privileged access comes\nwith no guarantee. At least in principle, you might be quite wrong\nabout the tumbling shapes. You might be dazzled by afterimages, or\nmomentarily confused, or hallucinating, or (unbeknownst to you)\ncolorblind. (Yes, people often don\u2019t know they are colorblind, a\npoint stressed by Kornblith 1998.) It is also at least in principle\npossible that others may know better than you, perhaps even\nsystematically so, what is transpiring in the kaleidoscope. You might\nthink the figure shows octagonal symmetry, but the rest of us,\nfamiliar with the kaleidoscope\u2019s design, might know that the\nsymmetry is hexagonal. A brilliant engineer may invent a kaleidoscope\nstate detector that can dependably reveal from outside the shape,\ncolor, and position of the tumbling chunks.\n\nWright raises this analogy to suggest that people\u2019s privilege\nwith respect to certain aspects of their mental lives must be\ndifferent from that of the person with the kaleidoscope; but other\nphilosophers, especially those who embrace self-detection accounts of\nintrospection, should find the analogy at least somewhat apt:\nIntrospective privilege is akin to the privilege of having a unique\nand advantageous sensory perspective on something. Metaphorically\nspeaking, we are the only ones who can gaze directly at our attitudes\nor our stream of experience, while others must rely on us or on\noutward signs. Less metaphorically, in generating introspective\njudgments (or beliefs or knowledge) about one\u2019s own mentality\none employs a detection process available to no one else. It is then\nan empirical question how accurate the deliverances of this process\nare; but on the assumption that the deliverances are in a broad range\nof conditions at least somewhat accurate and more accurate than the\ntypical judgments other people make about those same aspects of your\nmind, you have a \u201cprivileged\u201d perspective. Typically,\nadvocates of self-detection models of introspection regard the\nmechanism or cognitive process generating introspective judgments or\nbeliefs as highly reliable in roughly this way, but not infallible,\nand not immune to correction by other people (Armstrong 1968;\nChurchland 1988; Hill 1981, 2009; Lycan 1996; Nichols and Stich 2003;\nGoldman 2000, 2006).\n4.2 Empirical Evidence on the Accuracy of Introspection\n\nThe arguments of the previous section are a priori in at least the\nbroad sense of that term (the psychologists\u2019 sense): They depend\non general conceptual considerations and armchair folk psychology\nrather than on empirical research. To these might be added the\nargument, due to Boghossian (1989) that \u201cexternalism\u201d\nabout the content of our attitudes (the view that our attitudes depend\nconstitutively not just on what is going on internally but also on\nfacts about our environment; Putnam 1975; Burge 1979) seems to\nproblematize introspective self-knowledge of those attitudes. This\nissue will not be treated here, since it is amply covered in the\nentries on\n externalism about mental content\n and\n externalism and self-knowledge.\n\nNow we turn to empirical research on our self-knowledge of those\naspects of our minds often thought to be accessible to introspection.\nSince character traits are not generally regarded as introspectible\naspects of our mentality, we\u2019ll skip the large literature on the\naccuracy or inaccuracy of our judgments about them (e.g., Taylor and\nBrown 1988; Paulhus and John 1998; Funder 1999; Vazire 2010; see also\nHaybron\u2019s 2008 skeptical perspective on our knowledge of how\nhappy we are); nor will we discuss self-knowledge of subpersonal,\nnonconscious mental processes, such as the processes underlying visual\nrecognition of color and shape.\n\nAs a general matter, while a priori accounts of the epistemology of\nintrospection have tended to stress its privilege and accuracy,\nempirical accounts have tended to stress its failures.\n4.2.1 Of the Causes of Attitudes and Behavior\n\nPerhaps the most famous argument in the psychological literature on\nintrospection and self-knowledge is Nisbett and Wilson\u2019s\nargument that we have remarkably poor knowledge of the causes of, and\nprocesses underlying, our behavior and attitudes (Nisbett and Wilson\n1977; Nisbett and Ross 1980; Wilson 2002). Section 2.1 above briefly\nmentioned their emblematic finding that people in a shopping mall were\noften ignorant of a major factor\u2014position\u2014influencing\ntheir judgments about the quality of pairs of stockings. In Nisbett\nand Bellows (1977), also briefly mentioned above, participants were\nasked to assess the influence of various factors on their judgments\nabout features of a supposed job applicant. As in Nisbett and\nWilson\u2019s stocking study, participants denied the influence of\nsome factors that were in fact influential; for example, they denied\nthat the information that they would meet the applicant influenced\ntheir judgments about the applicant\u2019s flexibility. (It actually\nhad a major influence, as assessed by comparing the judgments of\nparticipants who were told and not told that they would meet the\napplicant.) Participants also attributed influence to factors that\nwere not in fact influential; for example, they falsely reported that\nthe information that the applicant accidentally knocked over a cup of\ncoffee during the interview influenced \u201chow sympathetic the\nperson seems\u201d to them. Nisbett and Bellows found that ordinary\nobservers\u2019 hypothetical ratings of the influence of the various\nfactors on the various judgments closely paralleled the\nparticipants\u2019 own ratings of the factors influencing\nthem\u2014a finding used by Nisbett to argue that people have no\nspecial access to causal influences on their judgments and instead\nrely on the same sorts of theoretical considerations outside observers\nrely on (the self/other parity view described in Section 2.1). Despite\nsome objections (such as White 1988), both psychologists and\nphilosophers now tend to accept Nisbett\u2019s and Wilson\u2019s\nview that there is at best only a modest first-person advantage in\nassessing the factors influencing our judgments and behavior.\n\nIn series of experiments, Gazzaniga (1995) presented commissurotomy\npatients (people with severed corpus callosum) with different visual\nstimuli to each hemisphere of the brain. With cross-hemispheric\ncommunication severely impaired due to the commissurotomy, the left\nhemisphere, controlling speech, had information about one part of the\nvisual stimulus, while the right hemisphere, controlling some aspects\nof movement (especially the left hand) had information about a\ndifferent part. Gazzaniga reported finding that when these\n\u201csplit brain\u201d patients were asked to explain why they did\nsomething, when that action was clearly caused by input to the right,\nnon-verbal hemisphere, the left hemisphere would sometimes fluently\nconfabulate an explanation. For example, Gazzaniga reports presenting\nan instruction like \u201claugh\u201d to the right hemisphere,\nmaking the patient laugh. When asked why he laughed, the patient would\nsay something like \u201cYou guys come up and test us every month.\nWhat a way to make a living!\u201d (1393). When a chicken claw was\nshown to the left hemisphere and snow scene to the right, and the\npatient was asked to select an appropriate picture from an array, the\nright hand would point to a chicken and the left hand to a snow\nshovel, and when asked why they selected those two things, the patient\nwould say something like \u201cOh, that\u2019s simple. The chicken\nclaw goes with the chicken and you need a shovel to clean out the\nchicken shed\u201d (ibid.). Similar confabulation about motives is\nsometimes (but not always) seen in people whose behavior is,\nunbeknownst to them, driven by post-hypnotic suggestion (Richet 1884;\nMoll 1889 [1911]), and in disorders such as hemineglect (anosognosia),\nblindness denial (Anton\u2019s syndrome), and Korsakoff\u2019s\nsyndrome (Hirstein 2005).\n\nIn a normal population, Johansson and collaborators (Johansson et al.\n2005; Johansson et al. 2006) manually displayed to participants pairs\nof pictures of women\u2019s faces. On each trial, the participant was\nto point to the face he found more attractive. The picture of that\nface was then centered before the participant while the other face was\nhidden. On some trials, participants were asked to explain the reasons\nfor their choices while continuing to look at the selected face. On a\nfew key trials, the experimenters used sleight-of-hand to present to\nthe participant the face that was not selected as though it\nhad been the face selected. Strikingly, the switch was noticed only\n28% of the time. What\u2019s more, when the change was not detected\nparticipants actually gave explanations for their choice that appealed\nto specific features of the unselected face that were not possessed by\nthe selected face 13% of the time. For example, one participant\nclaimed to have chosen the face before him \u201cbecause I love\nblondes\u201d when in fact he had chosen a dark-haired face\n(Johansson et al. 2006, 690). Johansson and colleagues failed to find\nany systematic differences in the explanations of choice between the\nmanipulated and non-manipulated trials, using a wide variety of\nmeasures. They found, for example, no difference in linguistic markers\nof confidence (including pauses in speech), emotionality, specificity\nof detail, complexity or length of description, or general position in\nsemantic space. These results, like Nisbett\u2019s and\nWilson\u2019s, suggest that at least some of the time when people\nthink they are explaining the bases of their decisions, they are\ninstead merely theorizing or confabulating.\n\nWegner has found that people can often be manipulated into believing\nthat they willed or intended behavior that is in fact caused by\nanother person\u2019s manipulation and, conversely, that they exerted\nno control over movements that were in fact their own\u2014as with\nOuija boards, with or without a cheating, intentionally directive\nconfederate (Wegner and Wheatley 1999; Wegner 2002). The literature on\n\u201ccognitive dissonance\u201d is replete with cases in which\nparticipants\u2019 attitudes appear to change for reasons they do, or\nwould, deny. According to cognitive dissonance theory, when people\nbehave or appear to behave counternormatively (e.g., incompetently,\nfoolishly, immorally), they will tend to adjust their attitudes so as\nto make the behavior seem less counternormative or\n\u201cdissonant\u201d (Festinger 1957; Aronson 1968; Cooper and\nFazio 1984; Stone and Cooper 2001). For example, people induced to\nfalsely describe as enjoyable a monotonous task they\u2019ve just\ncompleted will tend, later, to report having a more positive attitude\ntoward the task then those not induced to lie (though much less so if\nthey were handsomely paid to lie in which case the behavior is not\nclearly counternormative; Festinger and Carlsmith 1959; but see Bem\n1967, 1972 for an argument that the attitude doesn\u2019t change but\nonly the report of it). Presumably, if such attitude changes were\nknown to the person they would generally fail to have their\ndissonance-reducing effect. Research psychologists have also confirmed\nsuch familiar phenomena as \u201csour grapes\u201d (Elster\n1983/2016; Lyubomirsky and Ross 1999; Kay, Jiminez, and Jost 2002) and\n\u201cself-deception\u201d (Mele 2001) which presumably also involve\nignorance of the factors driving the relevant judgments and actions.\nAnd of course the Freudian psychoanalytic tradition has also long held\nthat people often have only poor knowledge of their motives and the\ninfluences on their attitudes (Wollheim 1981; Cavell 2006).\n\nIn light of this empirical research, no major philosopher now holds\n(perhaps no major philosopher ever held) that we have infallible,\nindubitable, incorrigible, or self-intimating knowledge of the causes\nof our judgments, decisions, and behavior. Perhaps weaker forms of\nprivilege also come under threat. But the question arises: Whatever\nfailures there may be in assessing the causes of our attitudes and\nbehavior, are those failures failures of introspection,\nproperly construed? Psychologists tend to cast these results as\nfailures of \u201cintrospection\u201d, but if it turns out that a\nvery different and more trustworthy process underwrites our knowledge\nof some other aspects of our minds\u2014such as what our present\nattitudes are (however caused) or our currently ongoing or recently\npast conscious experience\u2014then perhaps we can call only\nthat process introspection, thereby retaining some robust\nform of introspective privilege while acceding to the psychological\nconsensus regarding (what we would now call non-introspective)\nfirst-person knowledge of causes. Indeed, few contemporary\nphilosophical accounts of introspection or privileged self-knowledge\nhighlight, as the primary locus of privilege, the causes of our\nattitudes and behavior (though Bilgrami 2006 is a notable exception).\nThus, the literature reviewed in this section can be interpreted as\nsuggesting that the causes of our behavior are not, after all, the\nsorts of things to which we have introspective access.\n4.2.2 Of Attitudes\n\nResearch psychologists have generally not been as skeptical of our\nknowledge of our attitudes as they have been of our knowledge of the\ncauses of our attitudes (Section 4.2.1 above). In fact, many of the\nsame experiments that purport to show inaccurate knowledge of the\ncauses of our attitudes nonetheless rely unguardedly on self-report\nfor assessment of the attitudes themselves\u2014a feature of those\nexperiments criticized by Bem (1967). Attitudinal surveys in\npsychology and social science generally rely on participants\u2019\nself-report as the principal source of evidence about attitudes (de\nVaus 1985/2002; Sirken et al. (eds.) 1999). However, as in the case of\nmotives and causes, there\u2019s a long tradition in clinical\npsychology skeptical of our self-knowledge of our attitudes, giving a\nlarge role to \u201cunconscious\u201d motives and attitudes.\n\nA key challenge in assessing the accuracy of people\u2019s beliefs or\njudgments about their attitudes is the difficulty of accurately\nmeasuring attitudes independently of self-report. There is at present\nno tractable measure of attitude that is generally seen by\nphilosophers as overriding individuals\u2019 own reports about their\nattitudes. However, in the psychological literature,\n\u201cimplicit\u201d measures of attitudes\u2014measures of\nattitudes that do not reply on self-report\u2014have recently been\ngaining considerable attention (see Wittenbrink and Schwarz, eds.,\n2007; Petty, Fazio, and Bri\u00f1ol, eds., 2009). Such measures are\nsometimes thought capable of revealing unconscious attitudes or\nimplicit attitudes either unavailable to introspection or erroneously\nintrospected (Wilson, Lindsey, and Schooler 2000; Kihlstrom 2004; Lane\net al. 2007; though see Hahn et al. 2014).\n\nMuch of the leading research on implicit attitude measures has\nconcerned racism, in accord with the view that racist attitudes,\nthough common, are considered socially undesirable and therefore often\nnot self-ascribed even when present. For example, Campbell, Kruskal,\nand Wallace (1966) explored the use of seating distance as an index of\nracial attitudes, noting that racially Black and White students tended\nto aggregate in classroom seating arrangements. Using facial\nelectromyography (EMG), Vanman et al. (1997) found (racially) White\nparticipants to display facial responses indicative of negative affect\nmore frequently when asked to imagine co-operative activity with Black\nthan with White partners\u2014results interpreted as indicative of\nracist attitudes. Cunningham et al. (2004) showed White and Black\nfaces to White participants while participants were undergoing fMRI\nbrain imaging. They found less amygdala activation when participants\nlooked at faces from their own group than when participants looked at\nother faces; and since amygdala activation is generally associated\nwith negative emotion, they interpreted this tendency suggesting a\nnegative attitude toward outgroup members (see also Hart et al 1990;\nand for discussion Ito and Cacioppo 2007).\n\nMuch of the recent implicit attitude research has focused on response\npriming and interference in speeded tasks. In priming research, a\nstimulus (the \u201cprime\u201d) is briefly displayed, followed by a\nmask that hides it, and then a second stimulus (the\n\u201ctarget\u201d) is displayed. The participant\u2019s task is to\nrespond as swiftly as possible to the target, typically with a\nclassification judgment. In evaluative priming, for example,\nthe participant is primed with a positively or negatively valenced\nword or picture (e.g., snake), then asked to make a swift judgment\nabout whether the subsequently presented target word (e.g.,\n\u201cdisgusting\u201d) is good or bad, or has some other feature\n(e.g., belongs to a particular category). Generally, negative primes\nwill speed response for negative targets while delaying response for\npositive targets, and positive primes will do the reverse. Researchers\nhave found that photographs of Black faces, whether presented visibly\nor whether presented so quickly as to be subliminal, tend to\nfacilitate the categorization of negative targets and delay the\ncategorization of positive targets for White participants\u2014a\nresult widely interpreted as revealing racist attitudes (Fazio et al.\n1995; Dovidio et al. 1997; Wittenbrink, Judd, and Park 1997). In the\nImplicit Association Test, respondents are asked to respond\ndisjunctively to combined categories, giving for example one response\nif they see either a dark-skinned face or a positively valenced word\nand a different response if they see either a light-skinned face or a\nnegatively valenced word. As in evaluative priming tasks, White\nrespondents tend to respond more slowly when asked to pair\ndark-skinned faces with positively valenced words than with negatively\nvalenced words, which is interpreted as revealing a negative attitude\nor association (Greenwald, McGhee, and Schwartz 1998; Lane et al.\n2007). However, it should be noted that despite its prominence, the\nImplicit Association Task has recently been criticized as having poor\ntest-retest reliability and weak correlations with other measures of\nracism (Oswald, Mitchell, Blanton, Jaccard, and Tetlock 2013;\nGawronski, Morrison, Phills, and Galdi 2017; Payne, Vuletich, and\nLundberg 2017; Singal 2017).\n\nAs mentioned above, such implicit measures are often interpreted as\nrevealing attitudes to which people have poor or no introspective\naccess. The evidence that people lack introspective knowledge of such\nattitudes generally turns on the low correlations between such\nimplicit measures of racism and more explicit measures such as\nself-report\u2014though due to the recognized social undesirability\nof racial prejudice, it is difficult to disentangle\nself-presentational from self-knowledge factors in self-reports (Fazio\net al. 1995; Greenwald, McGhee, and Schwartz 1998; Wilson, Lindsey,\nand Schooler 2000; Greenwald and Nosek 2009). People who appear racist\nby implicit measures might disavow racism and inhibit racist patterns\nof response on explicit measures (such as when asked to rate the\nattractiveness of faces of different races) because they don\u2019t\nwant to be seen as racist\u2014a motivation that might drive\nthem whether or not they have accurate self-knowledge of their racist\nattitudes. Still, it seems prima facie plausible that people have at\nbest limited knowledge of the patterns of association that drive their\nresponses on priming and other implicit measures.\n\nBut what do such tests really measure? In philosophy, Zimmerman (2018)\nand Gendler (2008a, 2008b) have argued that measures like the Implicit\nAssociation Test do not measure actual racist beliefs but rather\nsomething else, something under less rational control (Gendler calls\nthem \u201caliefs\u201d). Schwitzgebel (2010) argues that people who\nare implicitly prejudiced but explicitly egalitarian are \u201cin\nbetween\u201d believing and failing to believe the egalitarian\npropositions that they sincerely accept (see also Levy 2015). Machery\n(2016) argues that implicit measures reveal multi-track dispositions,\nrather than attitudes. Gawronski and Bodenhausen (2006) advance a\nmodel according to which there is a substantial difference between\nimplicit attitudes, defined in terms of associative processes, and\nexplicit attitudes which have a propositional structure and are guided\nby standards of truth and consistency (see also Wilson, Lindsey, and\nSchooler 2000; Greenwald and Nosek 2009). Mandelbaum (2016) and\nBorgoni (2016) also endorse views on which people who are implicitly\nprejudiced but explicitly egalitarian have contradictory attitudes,\nthough they argue that both the implicit and the explicit attitudes\nare propositionally structured and to some extent subject to norms of\nrationality. Payne, Vuletich and Lundberg (2017) argue that implicit\nmeasures capture the situationally-variable accessibility of\nculturally given concepts.\n\nHow one answers this question about the relation between implicit bias\nand belief or other attitudes bears on the question of the accuracy of\nintrospection of the belief or other attitude in question. On the\nassumption that people are unaware of the extent of their bias, or at\nleast have no direct introspective access to their bias, that failure\nof introspection of bias constitutes a failure of introspection with\nrespect to the attitude in question. On the other hand, if what is at\nstake is merely an association or trait-like disposition, rather than\nan attitude, failure of introspectibility is unsurprising and does not\nbear on the general question of the introspection of attitudes.\n\nThe issue generalizes beyond implicit bias. To the extent attitudes\nare held to be reflected in, or even defined by, our explicit\njudgments about the matter in question and also, differently but\nperhaps not wholly separably (see Section 2.3.4 above), our explicit\njudgments about our attitudes toward the matter in question,\nour self-knowledge would seem to be correspondingly secure and\nimplicit measures beside the point. To the extent attitudes are held\nto crucially involve swift and automatic, or unreflective, patterns of\nreaction and association, our self-knowledge of them would appear to\nbe correspondingly problematic, corrigible by data from implicit\nmeasures (Bohner and Dickel 2011; Schwitzgebel 2011a,\nforthcoming).\n\nSimilarly, Carruthers (2011; see also Bem 1967, 1972; Rosenthal 2001;\nCassam 2014) argues that the evidence of Nisbett, Gazzaniga, Wegner,\nand others (reviewed in Section 4.2.1 above) shows that people\nconfabulate not just in reporting the causes of their\nattitudes but also in reporting the attitudes themselves. For example,\nCarruthers suggests that if someone in Nisbett and Wilson\u2019s\nfamous 1977 study confabulates \u201cI thought this pair was\nsoftest\u201d as an explanation of their choice of the rightmost pair\nof stockings, they err not only about the cause of their choice but\nalso in self-ascribing the judgment that the pair was softest. On this\nbasis, Carruthers adopts a self/other parity view (see Section 2.1\nabove) of our self-knowledge of our attitudes, holding that we can\nonly introspect, in the strict sense, conscious experiences like those\nthat arise in perception and imagery.\n4.2.3 Of Conscious Experience\n\nCurrently ongoing conscious experience\u2014or maybe immediately past\nconscious experience (if we hold that introspective judgment must\ntemporally follow the state or process introspected, or if emphasize\nthe concerns raised in Section 3.2 about the self-undermining of the\nintrospective process)\u2014is both the most universally acknowledged\ntarget of the introspective process and the target most commonly\nthought to be known with a high degree of privilege. Infallibility,\nindubitability, incorrigibility, and self-intimation claims (see\nSection 4.1.1) are most commonly made for self-knowledge of states\nsuch as being in pain or having a visual experience as of the color\nred, where these states are construed as qualitative states, or\nsubjective experiences, or aspects of our phenomenology or\nconsciousness. (All these terms are intended interchangeably to refer\nto what Block [1995], Chalmers [1996], and other contemporary\nphilosophers call \u201cphenomenal consciousness\u201d.) If\nattitudes are sometimes conscious, then we might also be capable of\nintrospecting those attitudes as part of our capacity to introspect\nconscious experience generally (Goldman 2006; Hill 2009).\n\nIt\u2019s difficult to study the accuracy of self-ascriptions of\nconscious experience for the same reasons it\u2019s difficult to\nstudy the accuracy of our self-ascriptions of attitudes (Section\n4.2.2): There\u2019s no widely accepted measure to trump or confirm\nself-report. In the medical literature on pain, for example, no\nbehavioral or physiological measure of pain is generally thought\ncapable of overriding self-report of current pain, despite the fact\nthat scaling issues remain a problem within and especially between\nsubjects (Williams, Davies, and Chadury 2000) as does retrospective\nassessment (Redelmeier and Kahneman 1996). When physiological markers\nof pain and self-report dissociate, it\u2019s by no means clear that\nthe physiological marker should be taken as the more accurate index\n(for methodological recommendations see Price and Aydede 2005).\nCorresponding remarks apply to the case of pleasure (Haybron\n2008).\n\nAs mentioned in Section 3.3 above, early introspective psychologists\nboth asserted the difficulty of accurately introspecting conscious\nexperience and achieved only mixed success in their attempts to obtain\nscientifically replicable (and thus presumably accurate) data through\nthe use of trained introspectors. In some domains they achieved\nconsiderable success and replicability, such as in the construction of\nthe \u201ccolor solid\u201d (a representation of the three primary\ndimensions of variation in color experience: hue, saturation, and\nlightness or brightness), the mapping of the size of \u201cjust\nnoticeable differences\u201d between sensations and the\n\u201climinal\u201d threshold below which a stimulus is too faint to\nbe experienced, and the (at least roughly) logarithmic relationship\nbetween the intensity of a sensory stimulus and the intensity of the\nresulting experience (the \u201cWeber-Fechner law\u201d).\nContemporary psychophysics\u2014the study of the relation between\nphysical stimuli and the resulting sense experiences or\npercepts\u2014is rooted in these early introspective studies.\nHowever, other sorts of phenomena proved resistant to cross-laboratory\nintrospective consensus\u2014such as the possibility or not of\nimageless thought (see the entry on\n \u201cmental imagery\u201d),\n the structure of emotion, and the experiential aspects of of\nattention. Perhaps these facts about the range of early introspective\nagreement and apparently intractable disagreement cast light on the\nrange over which careful and well-trained introspection is and is not\nreliable.\n\nEricsson and Simon (1984/1993; Ericsson 2003) discuss and review\nrelationships between the participant\u2019s performance on various\nproblem-solving tasks, their concurrent verbalizations of conscious\nthoughts (\u201cthink aloud protocols\u201d), and their immediately\nretrospective verbalizations. The existence of good relationships in\nthe predicted directions in many problem-solving tasks lends empirical\nsupport to the view that people\u2019s reports about their stream of\nthoughts often accurately reflect those thoughts. For example,\nEricsson and Simon find that think-aloud and retrospective reports of\nthought processes correlate with predicted patterns of eye movement\nand response latency. Ericsson and Simon also cite studies like that\nof Hamilton and Sanford (1978), who asked participants to make yes or\nno judgments about whether pairs of letters were in alphabetical order\n(like MO) or not (like RP) and then to describe retrospectively their\nmethod for arriving at the judgments. When participants\nretrospectively reported knowing the answer\n\u201cautomatically\u201d without an intervening conscious process,\nreaction times were swift and did not depend on the distance between\nthe letters. When participants retrospectively reported \u201crunning\nthrough\u201d a sequential series of letters (such as\n\u201cLMNO\u201d when prompted with \u201cMO\u201d) reaction times\ncorrelated nicely with reported length of run-through. On the other\nhand, Flavell, Green, and Flavell (1995) report gross and widespread\nintrospective error about recently past and even current (conscious)\nthought in young children; and Smallwood and Schooler (2006) review\nliterature that suggests that people are not especially good at\ndetecting when their mind is wandering.\n\nIn the 20th century, philosophers arguing against infallibilism often\ndevised hypothetical examples in which they suggested it was plausible\nto attribute introspective error; but even if such examples succeed,\nthey are generally confined to far-fetched scenarios, pathological\ncases, or very minor or very brief mistakes (e.g., Armstrong 1963;\nChurchland 1988; Kornblith 1998, with an eye to the distinction\nbetween mistakes about current conscious experience and other sorts of\nmistakes). In the 21st century, philosophical critics of the accuracy\nof introspective judgments about consciousness shifted their focus to\ncases of widespread disagreement or (putative) error, either among\nordinary people or among research specialists. Dennett (1991),\nBlackmore (2002), and Schwitzgebel (2011b), for example, argue that\nmost people are badly mistaken about the nature of the experience of\nperipheral vision. These authors argue that people experience visual\nclarity only in a small and rapidly moving region of about 1\u20132\ndegrees of visual arc, contrary to the (they say) widespread\nimpression most people have that they experience a substantially\nbroader range of stable clarity in the visual field. Other recent\narguments against the accuracy of introspective judgments about\nconscious experience turn on citing the widespread disagreement about\nwhether there is a \u201cphenomenology of thinking\u201d beyond that\nof imagery and emotion, about whether sensory experience as a whole is\n\u201crich\u201d (including for example constant tactile experience\nof one\u2019s feet in one\u2019s shoes) or \u201cthin\u201d\n(limited mostly just to what is in attention at any one time), and\nabout the nature of visual imagery experience (Hurlburt and\nSchwitzgebel 2007; Bayne and Spener 2010; Schwitzgebel 2011b; though\nsee Hohwy 2011).\n\nIrvine (2013, forthcoming) has argued that the methodological problems\nin this area are so severe that the term \u201cconsciousness\u201d\nshould be eliminated from scientific discourse as impossible to\neffectively operationalize or measure. Feest (2014) and Timmermans and\nCleeremans (2015) similarly highlight the substantial methodological\nchallenges using introspective reports in the science of\nconsciousness, though without being quite as pessimistic as\nIrvine.",
