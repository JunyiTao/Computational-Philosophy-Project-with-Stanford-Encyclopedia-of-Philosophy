    "main_text": "The Augustinian Understanding of Hell || Retributivist Objections\n2.1 Retributivist Objections\n\nOne set of objections arises from within the retributive theory\nitself, and here are three such objections that critics have raised.\nFirst, why should the greatness of the one against whom an\noffense occurs determine the degree of one\u2019s personal\nguilt anyway? According to most proponents of the retributive\ntheory, the personal guilt of those who act wrongly must depend, at\nleast in part, upon certain facts about them. A schizophrenic\nyoung man who tragically kills his loving mother, believing her to be\na sinister space alien who has devoured his real mother, may need\ntreatment, they would say, but a just punishment seems out of the\nquestion. Similarly, the personal guilt of those who disobey God or\nviolate the divine commands must likewise depend upon the answer to\nsuch questions as these: Have they knowingly violated a\ndivine command?\u2014and if so, to what extent are they responsible\nfor their own rebellious impulses? To what extent do they possess not\nonly an implicit knowledge of God and the divine commands, but a clear\nvision of the nature of God? To what extent do they see clearly the\nchoice of roads, the consequences of their actions, or the true nature\nof evil? Even many Augustinians admit the relevance of such questions\nwhen they insist that Adam\u2019s sin was especially heinous because\nhe supposedly had special advantages, such as great happiness and the\nbeatific vision, that his descendants do not enjoy. If Adam\u2019s\nsin was especially heinous because he had special advantages, then the\nsins of those who lack his special advantages must be less heinous;\nand if that is true, if some sins against God are less heinous than\nothers, then the greatness of God cannot be the only, or even the\ndecisive, factor in determining the degree of one\u2019s personal\nguilt or the seriousness of a given sin (see Adams 1975, 442 and\nKvanvig 1993, 40\u201350).\n\nSecond, virtually all retributivists, with the notable exception of\nthe Augustinian theologians, reject as absurd the whole idea of\ninherited guilt. So why, one may ask, do so many Augustinians, despite\ntheir commitment to a retributive theory of punishment, insist that\nGod could justly condemn even infants on account of their supposedly\ninherited guilt? Part of the explanation, according to Philip Quinn,\nmay lie \u201cin a homuncular view of human nature itself\u201d\n(Quinn 1988, 99) or in what some philosophers might label as a simple\ncategory mistake. A good illustration of the homuncular view, as Quinn\ncalls it, might be the following chapter heading in Anselm\u2019s\nCur Deus Homo: \u201cWhat it was that man, when he sinned,\nremoved from God and cannot repay\u201d (I, Ch. 23). The implication\nof such language, which we also find in Augustine, Calvin, and a host\nof others, is that humankind or human nature or the human race as a\nwhole is itself a person (or homunculus) who can act and sin against\nGod. Perhaps that explains how Augustine could write: \u201cMan\n\u2026 produced depraved and condemned children. For we were all in\nthat one man, since we were all that one man who fell into sin\u201d\n(City of God, Bk. XIII, Ch. 14). And perhaps it also explains\nhow Calvin could write: \u201ceven infants themselves, while they\ncarry their condemnation with them from the mother\u2019s womb, are\nguilty not of another\u2019s fault but of their own\u201d fault\n(Calvin 1536, Bk. II, Ch. I, sec. 8). The reasoning here appears to\nrun as follows: Humankind is guilty of a grievous offense against God;\ninfants are instances of humankind; therefore, infants are likewise\nguilty of a grievous offense against God. But most retributivists\nwould reject this way of speaking as simply incoherent. Whether one\nagrees with it or not, one can at least understand the claim that\nAdam\u2019s sin had disastrous consequences for all his progeny in\nthat they inherited many defects, deficiencies, and degenerate\ndispositions. One can also understand Calvin\u2019s claim that, as a\nresult of original sin, \u201cour own insight \u2026 is utterly\nblind and stupid in divine matters\u201d and that \u201cman\u2019s\nkeenness of mind is mere blindness as far as the knowledge of God is\nconcerned\u201d (Calvin 1536, Bk. II, Ch. II, sec. 19). One can even\nunderstand the claim that we are morally responsible for doing\nsomething about our inherited defects, provided that we have the power\nand the opportunity to do so. But the claim that we are born\nguilty is another matter, as is the claim that we are all\ndeserving of everlasting punishment on account of having inherited\ncertain defects or deficiencies. Most retributivists would regard such\ninherited defects as excusing conditions that decrease,\nrather than increase, the degree of one\u2019s personal\nguilt. So even though the Augustinians accept the idea of divine\nretribution, they appear at the same time to reject important parts of\nthe retributive theory of punishment.\n\nThird, if, as Anselm insisted, even the slightest offense against God\nis infinitely serious and thus deserves a permanent loss of happiness\nas a just recompense, then the idea, so essential to the retributive\ntheory, that we can grade offenses and fit lesser punishments to\nlesser crimes appears to be in danger of collapsing. Many Christians\ndo, it is true, speculate that gradations of punishment exist in hell;\nsome sinners, they suggest, may experience greater pain than others,\nand some places in hell may be hotter than others. Augustine even\ntried to ameliorate his views concerning the fate of unbaptized\ninfants by suggesting that \u201csuch infants as quit the body\nwithout being baptized will be involved in the mildest condemnation of\nall\u201d (On Merit and the Forgiveness of Sins, and the Baptism\nof Infants, Bk. I, Ch. 21\n [available online]).\n But many retributivists would nonetheless respond as follows. If all\nof those in hell, including the condemned infants, are dead in the\ntheological sense of being separated from God forever, and if this\nimplies a permanent loss of both the beatific vision and every other\nconceivable source of worthwhile happiness, then they have all\nreceived a punishment so severe that the further grading of offenses\nseems pointless. We would hardly regard a king who executes every\nlaw-breaker, the jaywalker no less than the murderer, as just; nor\nwould we feel much better if, in an effort to fit the punishment to\nthe crime, the king should reserve the more \u201chumane\u201d forms\nof execution for the jaywalker. Once you make a permanent and\nirreversible loss of happiness the supposedly just penalty for the\nmost minor offense, the only option left for more serious offenses is\nto pile on additional suffering. But at some point piling on\nadditional suffering for more serious offenses seems utterly demonic,\nor at least so many retributivists would insist; and it does nothing\nto ameliorate a permanent loss of happiness for a minor offense or, as\nin the case of non-elect babies who die in infancy, for no real\noffense at all.\n\nAll of which brings one to what Marilyn McCord Adams and many others\nsee as the most crucial question of all. How could any sin\nthat a finite being commits in a context of ambiguity, ignorance, and\nillusion deserve an infinite penalty as a just recompense? (See Adams\n1993, 313).\n",
