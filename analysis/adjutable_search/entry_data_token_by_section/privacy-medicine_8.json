    "main_text": "Physical Privacy || Solitude\n2.1 Solitude\n\nSolitude is a form of physical privacy of special interest to medical\nethics (Storr 2005; Barbour 2004). The sick do not want to be lonely\nand abandoned, but they may want personal space and time alone.\nSolitude has value as a context for quiet reflection about the\nsignificance of illness and injury. A period of solitude after\nconsultation and self-education is a useful condition in which to make\nup one\u2019s mind about treatment options.\n\nThe sickest patients may both crave and fear solitude. When alone they\ncome face-to-face with the potentially cruel reality of impending\ndeath. Yet in company they may feel patronized or guilty about the\nburdens they impose on family and friends. Whether the suffering is\nthe agony of injury, childbirth, recovering from major surgery or\ndying, persons may feel that they should not have to deal with others\nwhile in such a state or at such a time. Implicit social norms\nvalidate deferring to wishes of the sick or dying for seclusion and\nsolitude (Post 1989; Nissenbaum 2009). These wishes may arise and be\nviolated not only in hospital, hospice or nursing home settings, but\nalso in mental hospitals and prisons, where panoptic policies of\nmonitoring and surveillance prevail (Bozovic 1995; Holmes and Federman\n2006: 16\u201317; Foucault 1977).\n",
