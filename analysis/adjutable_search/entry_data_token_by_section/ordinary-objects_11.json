    "main_text": "Against Revisionary Ontologies || Arguments from Charity\n3.2 Arguments from Charity\n\nOne way of approaching the question of whether there are statues is by\nasking whether the correct interpretation of the English language is\none according to which ordinary utterances of \u2018there are\nstatues\u2019 come out true. The interpretation of populations of\nspeakers is plausibly governed by a principle of charity that\nprohibits the gratuitous ascription of false beliefs and utterances to\npopulations of speakers. Such a principle\u2014which is independently\nmotivated by reflection on how it is that utterances come to have the\nmeanings that they do\u2014can be put to work in arguments for the\nexistence of ordinary objects and for the nonexistence of\nextraordinary objects. Here is one such argument from charity:\n\n(CH1)\nThe most charitable interpretation of English is one on which\nordinary utterances of \u2018there are statues\u2019 comes out\ntrue.\n(CH2)\nIf so, then ordinary utterances of \u2018there are statues\u2019\nare true.\n(CH3)\nIf ordinary utterances of \u2018there are statues\u2019 are\ntrue, then there are statues.\n(CH4)\nSo, there are statues.\n\n\nTo see the idea behind CH1, notice that both eliminativists and\nconservatives can agree that there are atoms arranged statuewise. The\nquestion is whether the English sentence \u2018there are\nstatues\u2019 should be interpreted in such a way that the existence\nof such atoms suffices for it to come out true. Let us call\ninterpretations of \u2018there are statues\u2019 on which the\nexistence of atoms arranged statuewise suffices for its truth\nliberal, and interpretations on which that does not suffice\nfor its truth demanding. The idea then is that, given the\navailability of both liberal and demanding interpretations, the former\nwould clearly be more charitable. CH2 is motivated by the thought that\nthere are no other content-determining factors that favor a demanding\ninterpretation over a liberal interpretation, in which case charity\nwins out and \u2018there are statues\u2019 is true. CH3 looks to be\na straightforward application of a plausible disquotation principle:\nif sentence S says that p, and S is true, then\n p.[60]\n\nOne might challenge CH1 on the grounds that charitable interpretation\nis a holistic matter, and, while the liberal interpretations are\ncharitable in some respects, they are uncharitable in others. After\nall, the puzzles and arguments discussed in\n \u00a72\n seem to show that no interpretation can secure the truth of\neverything that we are inclined to say about ordinary\nobjects. For instance, the liberal interpretations on which MC1 comes\nout true (\u2018Athena and Piece exist\u2019) must, on pain of\ncontradiction, make at least one of MC2 through MC4 come out false.\nBut then some other intuitively true claim\u2014perhaps,\n\u2018Athena and Piece (if they exist) are\nidentical\u2019\u2014will come out false. The demanding\ninterpretations on which MC1 comes out false do better than the\nliberal interpretations on this score, since they can make\nall of MC2 through MC4 come out true. This gain in charity\nmight then be held to counterbalance the loss in charity from\nrendering MC1\n false.[61]\n\n\nOne might also challenge CH1 on the grounds that the principle of\ncharity, properly understood, demands only that the utterances and\nbeliefs of ordinary speakers be reasonable, not that they be true.\nSince it looks to ordinary speakers as if there are statues,\nand since they have no reason to believe that appearances are\nmisleading (having never encountered the arguments for eliminativism),\ntheir utterances and beliefs would be reasonable even if false. The\nprinciple of charity, so understood, would not favor liberal\ninterpretations over demanding\n interpretations.[62]\n\n\nAnother strategy involves resisting the argument at CH2, by\nmaintaining that there are constraints beyond charity that favor the\ndemanding interpretations. Charity, after all, is not the only factor\ninvolved in determining the meanings of our utterances. Certain\npuzzles about content determination have been thought to show that the\ncontent of an expression or utterance cannot be determined solely by\nwhich sentences we are inclined to regard as true; it is also partly a\nmatter of the relative \u201cnaturalness\u201d or\n\u201celigibility\u201d of candidate contents. One who accepts this\nsort of account may maintain that the demanding interpretations,\nalthough less charitable, nevertheless assign more natural contents to\nEnglish sentences than the liberal interpretations, for instance by\nassigning a more natural meaning to the\n quantifiers.[63]\n\n\nFinally, CH3 may be resisted by compatibilists, according to whom what\nordinary speakers are saying is compatible with the\neliminativist\u2019s claim that statues do not exist. Since\nontological discussions (like this one) are not carried out in\nordinary English or ordinary contexts, one cannot infer that there are\nstatues from the fact that ordinary speakers can truly say\n\u2018there are statues\u2019, any more than I can infer that I am\non the moon from the fact that an astronaut truly utters \u2018I am\non the\n moon\u2019.[64]\n",
