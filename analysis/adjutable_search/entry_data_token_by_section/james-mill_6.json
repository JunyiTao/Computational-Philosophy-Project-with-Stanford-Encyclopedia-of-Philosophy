    "main_text": "The Essay on Government || The Reception of Government\n4.3 The Reception of Government\nThe idea that Mill was an apologist for middle-class interests was, of course, a later development. But what of his contemporaries\u2019 views of the Essay on Government? For so short an essay, Mill\u2019s Government proved to be remarkably controversial in his own day. Tories and Whigs thought its message wildly and even dangerously democratic, while many of Mill\u2019s fellow Utilitarians\u2014including Bentham, John Stuart Mill, and William Thompson\u2014believed that he did not go nearly far enough in advocating an extension of the franchise. Although more \u201cdemocratic\u201d in private discussion, Mill publicly advocated extending the franchise to include all male heads of household over the age of forty, leaving them to speak for and represent the interests of younger men and all women:\nOne thing is pretty clear, that all those individuals whose interests are indisputably included in those of other individuals, may be struck off without inconvenience. In this light may be viewed all children, up to a certain age, whose interests are involved in those of their parents. In this light, also, women may be regarded, the interest of almost all of whom is involved either in that of their fathers or in that of their husbands (Mill 1992, 27).\nThis, his eldest son later remarked, was \u201cthe worst [paragraph] he ever wrote\u201d (J.S. Mill 1961, 98). Most of Mill\u2019s critics were quick to seize upon it, if only because its conclusion contradicts two of Mill\u2019s oft-stated premises, namely that each of us is the best judge of our own interests and that anyone having unchecked power is bound to abuse it. As William Thompson argued in Appeal of One Half the Human Race (1825), Mill\u2019s premises pointed to the widest possible extension of the franchise, and not to the exclusion of \u201cone half the human race,\u201d viz. all women.\n",
