    "main_text": "\n\nFriedrich Schlegel (1772\u20131829) is of undisputed importance as a\nliterary critic, but interest in his work among philosophers has until\nrecently tended to be confined to a rather limited circle. However, as\nscholars have come to reassess in the last several years the\nphilosophical importance of early German Romanticism\u2014both as\nsomething of a counter-movement to German Idealism and as a\ncontributing factor within idealism\u2019s development\u2014so interest in\nSchlegel\u2019s distinctive philosophical contribution to his era has\nincreased. The entry below will consider the philosophical aspects of\nSchlegel\u2019s development and their relation to his contributions to\nliterary theory and practice.\n",
