    "main_text": "Objections to Mathematical Platonism || Other metaphysical objections\n3.3 Other metaphysical objections\n\nIn addition to Benacerraf\u2019s, a variety of metaphysical\nobjections to mathematical platonism have been developed. One of the\nmore famous examples is an argument of Nelson Goodman\u2019s against\nset theory. Goodman (1956) defends the Principle of\nNominalism, which states that whenever two entities have the same\nbasic constituents, they are identical. This principle can be regarded\nas a strengthening of the familiar set theoretic axiom of\nextensionality. The axiom of extensionality states that if two sets\n\\(x\\) and \\(y\\) have the same elements\u2014that is, if \\(\\forall u(u\n\\in x \\leftrightarrow u \\in y)\\)\u2014then they are identical. The\nPrinciple of Nominalism is obtained by replacing the membership\nrelation with its transitive\n closure.[14]\n The principle thus states that if \\(x\\) and \\(y\\) are borne \\(\\in^*\\)\nby the same individuals\u2014that is, if \\(\\forall u(u \\in^*\\) \\(x\n\\leftrightarrow u \\in^*\\) \\(y)\\)\u2014then \\(x\\) and \\(y\\) are\nidentical. By endorsing this principle, Goodman disallows the\nformation of sets and classes, allowing only the formation of\nmereological sums and the application to the standard mereological\noperations (as described by his \u201ccalculus of\nindividuals\u201d).\n\nHowever, Goodman\u2019s defense of the Principle of Nominalism is now\nwidely held to be unconvincing, as witnessed by the widespread\nacceptance by philosophers and mathematicians of set theory as a\nlegitimate and valuable branch of mathematics.\n",
