    "main_text": "Vagueness || Argument from Duplication\n7.1 Argument from Duplication\n\nThe first argument, due essentially to Geach, runs as follows.\nGeach\u2019s presentation did not involve clouds, but the principles\nare clearly stated in his version of the argument. (The argument shows\nthat if an ok is a cloud for arbitrary k,\nwe can easily generalize to the claim that for every i,\noi is a cloud.)\n\n\nD1.\nIf all the water droplets not in sk did not\nexist, then ok would be a cloud.\nD2.\nWhether ok is a cloud does not depend on\nwhether things distinct from it exist.\nC.\nok is a cloud.\n\n\n\nD2 implies that being a cloud is an\n intrinsic\n property. The idea is that by changing the world outside the cloud,\nwe do not change whether or not it is a cloud. There is, however,\nlittle reason to believe this is true. And given that it leads to a\nrather implausible conclusion, that there are millions of clouds where\nwe think there is one, there is some reason to believe it is false. We\ncan argue directly for the same conclusion. Assume many more water\ndroplets coalesce around our original cloud. There is still one cloud\nin the sky, but it determinately includes more water droplets than the\noriginal cloud. The fusion of those water droplets exists, and we may\nassume that they did not change their intrinsic properties, but they\nare now a part of a cloud, rather than a cloud. Even if\nsomething looks like a cloud, smells like a cloud and rains like a\ncloud, it need not be a cloud, it may only be a part of a cloud.\n",
