    "main_text": "Criticisms of Neoliberalism || Keynesian Rebuttals\n7.5 Keynesian Rebuttals\n\nNeoliberalism, as noted, arose in part in response to the dominance of\nKeynesian macro-economic policy. But Keynesians, most notably Paul\nKrugman (2012), have struck back by arguing that neoliberal criticisms\nof Keynesian policy fail. This is especially true because neoliberals\noften claimed that fiscal policy is ineffective stimulus\nvis-\u00e0-vis monetary stimulus. During the Great Recession,\nKrugman argued that the Federal Reserve had lowered interest rates so\nmuch that further monetary stimulus would fail, and so fiscal policy\nhad to intervene.\n\nMany of the criticisms of neoliberal regimes engaging in\n\u201causterity\u201d during the Great Recession are based in an\nunderlying Keynesian model, as the critics of government spending cuts\nduring the Great Recession were often based on the idea that they hurt\nthe economic prospects of the poor, whereas according to neoliberals,\nshrinking government spending during a recession is not harmful to the\npoor for a variety of reasons. See entry on\n philosophy of economics.\n",
