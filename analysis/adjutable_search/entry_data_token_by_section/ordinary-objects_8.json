    "main_text": "Against Conservative Ontologies || Overdetermination Arguments\n2.7 Overdetermination Arguments\n\nOverdetermination arguments aim to establish that ordinary objects of\nvarious kinds do not exist, by way of showing that there is no\ndistinctive causal work for them to do. Here is one such argument:\n\n(OD1)\nEvery event caused by a baseball is caused by atoms arranged\nbaseballwise.\n(OD2)\nNo event caused by atoms arranged baseballwise is caused by a\nbaseball.\n(OD3)\nSo, no events are caused by baseballs.\n(OD4)\nIf no events are caused by baseballs, then baseballs do not\nexist.\n(OD5)\nSo, baseballs do not\n exist.[43]\n\n\nFor the purposes of this argument, \u2018atoms\u2019 may be\nunderstood as a placeholder for whichever microscopic objects or stuff\nfeature in the best microphysical explanations of observable reality.\nThese may turn out to be the composite atoms of chemistry, they may be\nmereological simples, or they may even be a nonparticulate\n\u201cquantum froth\u201d.\n\nOne could resist OD1 by maintaining that some things that are caused\nby baseballs are not also caused by their atoms. On one way of\ndeveloping this line of response, baseballs \u201ctrump\u201d their\natoms: atoms arranged baseballwise can\u2019t collectively cause\nanything to happen so long as they\u2019re parts of the baseball. On\nanother, there is a division of causal labor: baseballs cause events\ninvolving macroscopic items like the shattering of windows, while\ntheir atoms cause events involving microscopic items like the\nscatterings of atoms arranged windowwise. Both strategies, however,\nlook to be in tension with the plausible claim that there is a\ncomplete causal explanation for every physical event wholly in terms\nof microphysical items. Moreover, this line of response would seem to\nrequire that baseballs have emergent properties\u2014causally\nefficacious properties that cannot be accounted for in terms of the\nproperties of their atomic parts\u2014which seems\n implausible.[44]\n\nOD2 can be motivated as follows:\n\n(OD6)\nIf an event is caused by a baseball and by atoms arranged\nbaseballwise, then the event is overdetermined by the baseball and\natoms arranged baseballwise.\n(OD7)\nNo event is overdetermined by a baseball and atoms arranged\nbaseballwise.\n(OD2)\nSo, no event caused by atoms arranged baseballwise is caused by a\nbaseball.\n\n\nLet us say that an event e is overdetermined by o1 and\no2 just in case:\n\n(i)\n o1 causes e,\n (ii)\n o2 causes e,\n (iii)\n o1 is not causally relevant to\no2\u2019s causing e, \n (iv)\n o2 is not causally relevant to\no1\u2019s causing e, and\n (v)\n o1\u2260 o2.\n\n\nThis can be taken as a stipulation about how\n\u2018overdetermined\u2019 is to be understood in the argument, thus\npreempting nebulous debates about whether satisfying these five\nconditions suffices for \u201creal\u201d or \u201cgenuine\u201d\noverdetermination. To say that o1 is causally relevant to\no2\u2019s causing e is to say that o1 enters\ninto the explanation of how o2 causes e to occur in one of\nthe following ways: by causing o2 to cause e, by being\ncaused by o2 to cause e, by jointly causing e together with\no2, or\u2014where o2 is a plurality of\nobjects\u2014by being one of\n them.[45]\n\n\nCan OD6 be resisted? The idea would have to be that, although some\nevents are caused both by atoms and by baseballs composed of those\natoms, those events are not overdetermined (in the indicated sense).\nBut if they are not overdetermined, then which of the five conditions\nfor overdetermination do the baseball and the atoms fail to meet? This\nline of response takes for granted that (i) and (ii) are satisfied.\nAnd it is extremely plausible that (iii) and (iv) would be satisfied\nas well. However it is that baseballs \u201cget in on the\naction\u201d, it isn\u2019t by entering into the causal explanation\nof how the atoms manage to cause things. Baseballs\ndon\u2019t cause their atoms to shatter windows, nor do their atoms\ncause them to shatter windows. So those who would deny OD6 will need\nto deny that condition (v) is satisfied, by taking the baseball to be\nidentical to the atoms. See\n \u00a73.3\n below for discussion of the thesis that objects are identical to\ntheir various parts.\n\nWhy accept OD7? In certain cases, overdetermination strikes us as an\novert violation of Ockham\u2019s Razor: do not multiply entities\nbeyond necessity. But given the intimate connection between baseballs\nand their atoms, it is natural to feel that even if these do count as\ncases of overdetermination (in the indicated sense), this isn\u2019t\nan especially objectionable sort of overdetermination. One may then\nattempt to resist OD7 by articulating a further condition which\ndistinguishes problematic from unproblematic cases of\noverdetermination. For instance, one might hold that overdetermination\nby o1 and o2 is unproblematic so long as\no1 and o2 aren\u2019t entirely\n independent.[46]\n\nEven supposing, however, that the line between objectionable and\nunobjectionable sorts of overdetermination can be drawn in some\nsatisfactory way, there would still be pressure to accept OD7. We\nshould accept that something other than the atoms shatters the window\nonly if we have good reason to believe in this something. But there is\nno explanatory need to posit baseballs, since there is a\ncomplete causal explanation for all of the relevant events wholly in\nterms of the activities of the atoms. And the debunking arguments in\n \u00a72.6\n purport to show that our ordinary perceptual reasons for believing in\nbaseballs are no good. So we would seem to have no good reason at all\nto accept that there are baseballs, in which case we ought to accept\n OD7.[47]\n\n\nPremise OD4 can be motivated in much the same way as OD7. If baseballs\ndon\u2019t cause anything to happen, then we have no good reason to\nbelieve in them, in which case we should accept OD4. One might also\ngive a more direct defense of OD4 by appealing to the controversial\nEleatic Principle (a.k.a. Alexander\u2019s Dictum), according to\nwhich everything that exists has causal powers. Together with the\nplausible assumption that if baseballs don\u2019t cause anything\nit\u2019s because they can\u2019t cause anything, the\nEleatic Principle entails\n OD4.[48]\n",
