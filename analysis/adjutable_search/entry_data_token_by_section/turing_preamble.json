It gave a\nfresh approach to the traditional mind-body problem, by relating it to\nthe mathematical concept of computability he himself had introduced in\nhis 1936\u20137 paper \u201cOn computable numbers, with an application to the\nEntscheidungsproblem.\u201d His work can be regarded as the foundation of\ncomputer science and of the artificial intelligence program.\n",
