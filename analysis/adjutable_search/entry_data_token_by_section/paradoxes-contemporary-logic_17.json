    "main_text": "Paradoxes: between metamathematics and type-free foundations (1930\u20131945) || Criticizing standard implication and negation\n5.4 Criticizing standard implication and negation\n\nIn the 1930s, an alternative route to solve the antinomies emerged.\nThis approach exploits the duplication (contraction) combinator \\(W\\)\nwhich satisfies \\(Wfx=fxx\\); if \\(N\\) represents negation and\n\\(Babc=a(bc)\\), then \\(W(BN)(W(BN))\\) is a fixed point of negation,\nand it is a functional analogue of the Russell class. On the logical\nlevel, assigning a type to \\(W\\) leads to the essential inference\napplied in the derivation of Curry\u2019s paradox, i.e., the\ncontraction rule \\(A\\rightarrow(A\\rightarrow B)\n\\Rightarrow(A\\rightarrow B)\\). The role of contraction was noticed by\nFitch 1936, who observed that, in order to derive the Russell paradox\none considers a function of two variables, then one diagonalizes and\nregards such an object as a new unary propositional function. But this\nstep only works if \\(W\\) is accepted. Fitch then proposed a\n\u201cnon-contractive\u201d logic, but his paper did not go beyond a\nbrief sketch of a fragment of classical logic with predicates. One has\nto wait until the mid eighties to see contraction-free logics used\nsystematically in proof theory and in theoretical computer science\n(see the entry\n linear logic).\n\nFitch 1942 proposed a new approach to the problem of finding\nconsistent combinatory logic systems, which were progressively\nexpanded and refined over many years (until 1980). Fitch\u2019s\nmethod to avoid paradoxes consists of the construction of suitable\nsyntactical models, endowed with self-referential notions of class,\nmembership and truth. Truth and membership are inductively\ngenerated by iterating rules that correspond to natural logical\nclosure conditions and can be formalized by means of positive\n(i.e. negation- and implication-free) clauses. This fact implies that\nthe generation process is cumulative and becomes saturated at a\ncertain point, thus yielding consistent non-trivial interpretations\nfor truth and membership. Mathematically, a collection of positive\nclauses always gives rise to an operator, say \\(G\\), mapping sets of\nexpressions into sets of expressions and preserving the inclusion\nrelation (i.e., monotone); the saturated sets then correspond to fixed\npoints of the monotone operator \\(G\\) (i.e., to sets \\(X\\) satisfying\n\\(G(X)=X)\\), which exist according to a classical theorem about\ncomplete lattices (see Birkhoff 1967).\n\nIn the early 1940s, Fitch explored a purely positive (negationless)\ncombinatory system \\(K\\) with the explicit aim of defining a sort of\nuniversal formal system, where every system of logic\ncould be represented. Later he was able to strengthen his approach to\ninclude forms of negation and implication, insofar as he provided\na simultaneous generation of truth and falsehood, and this\nactually amounts to conceive truth as a partial predicate.\nFitch\u2019s approach is radically intensional: classes are always\nclasses of expressions \\(M\\) in some language (say, of the basic\nlogic) and they are identified with attributes, while membership is\nessentially reduced to truth in the sense of \\(K\\). Thus, that \\(M\\in\nT\\) holds, essentially means that \\(M\\) truly falls under the property\nspecified (or expressed) by \\(T\\) (see also the entry on\n combinatory logic).\n Logical systems, along similar lines, were also proposed and proved\nconsistent via proof theoretic methods by Sch\u00fctte in the early\nfifties (see Sch\u00fctte 1960 for a comprehensive treatment).\n\nTo a certain extent, the ideas of Fitch can be regarded as introducing\nthe view that the basic predicates of truth and membership have to be\npartial or, if you like, three-valued. Bochvar\n(1937) outlines a proposal based on the introduction of a three-valued\nlogic, where, besides the standard truth values T (truth) and F\n(false), there exists a third value N, to be interpreted as\n\u201cmeaningless\u201d. His logical analysis leads to the\nconclusion that the paradoxes involve meaningless statements. A\ncharacteristic feature of Bochvar\u2019s formalism is that it\ndistinguishes two types of connectives, roughly corresponding to two\ndifferent modes of assertion. A statement \\(A\\) in itself assumes\nexactly one among the prescribed values (true, false or meaningless);\nbut the internal three-valued logical operations are also\nequipped with external logical operations, which correspond\nto statements on the metalevel and allow the use of classical logic in\ndealing with non-classical statements. Formally, he described three\nvalued truth tables for the main propositional internal connectives\n& (and), \\(\\sim\\) (negation), \\(\\vee\\) (or), \\(\\rightarrow\\)\n(implication), \\(\\leftrightarrow\\) (logical equivalence). The truth\nvalues of \\(\\sim A, A \\amp B\\), etc., coincide with their classical\nvalues if \\(A, B\\) assume classical values; they are meaningless\n(assume value N) if one among \\(A, B\\) has value N (strictness). No\nformula built up with the standard connectives can be valid (or a\ntautology, i.e., is true under all possible assignments), as \\(A\n\\rightarrow A\\) has value N, if \\(A\\) is meaningless. But there are\nconnectives allowing the formation of metatheorical\nstatements such as \\(\\vdash A, \\neg A, \\downarrow A\\), to be read\nas \u201c\\(A\\) is true\u201d, \u201c\\(A\\) is false\u201d, \u201cA\nis meaningless\u201d (in the given order). The value of \\(\\vdash A\n(\\neg A)\\) is true if \\(A\\) is true (false), false (true) otherwise.\nBochvar describes a version of the extended type-free logical calculus\nof Hilbert-Ackermann (1928), and, in order to dispose of the\nparadoxes, he restricts substitution and hence the comprehension\nschema of the form\n\n\\(\\exists F\\forall x(F(x) \\leftrightarrow \\phi)\\), where \\(\\phi\\) is\nany formula in which \\(F\\) is not free and which may or may not have\n\\(x\\) free.\n\nto conditions \\(\\phi\\) with only internal logical operations.\nApparently, Bochvar\u2019s solution is not simply a gap\nsolution, where the logic is weakened; instead, he formalizes the\ndistinction between object level and metalevel in\nthe logic itself. This makes his theory quite expressive (e.g., it can\nhandle the very notion of \u201cnon-sensical\u201d,\n\u201cmeaningless\u201d).\n",
