    "main_text": "Modeling Agreement\n3. Modeling Agreement\n\nSocial contract theories fundamentally differ in whether the parties\nreason differently or the same. As we have seen (\u00a72.3) in\nRawls\u2019s Original Position, everyone reasons the same: the\ncollective choice problem is reduced to the choice of one individual.\nAny one person\u2019s decision is a proxy for everyone else. In\nsocial contracts of this sort, the description of the parties (their\nmotivation, the conditions under which they choose) does all the work:\nonce we have fully specified the reasoning of one party, the contract\nhas been identified.\n\nThe alternative view is that, even after we have specified the parties\n(including their rationality, values and information), they continue\nto disagree in their rankings of possible social contracts. On this\nview, the contract only has a determinate result if there is some way\nto commensurate the different rankings of each individual to yield an\nagreement (D\u2019Agostino 2003). We can distinguish four basic\nagreement mechanisms of doing this.\n",
