    "main_text": "Premise II: The Cause-Law Principle || Justifying the Cause-Law Principle\n3.2 Justifying the Cause-Law Principle\n\nDavidson argues for the cause-law principle\u2014that singular causal\nrelations require strict covering laws\u2014on the basis of a\nconceptual interconnection between the concepts of physical\nobject, event and law. As he says, \u201cour\nconcept of a physical object is the concept of an object whose changes\nare governed by laws\u201d (Davidson 1995a, 274). The\ninterconnections are established partly in response to C.J.\nDucasse\u2019s attempt, in reaction to Hume\u2019s regularity theory\nof causation, to define singular causal relations without appeal to\ncovering laws (Ducasse 1926).\n\nSimply put, Ducasse defined some particular event c as the\ncause of some effect e if and only if c was the only\nchange occurring in the immediate environment of e just prior\nto e. The striking of the match is the cause of the flaming\nmatch just insofar as the striking is the only change occurring in the\nimmediate vicinity of the flaming match just prior to the flaming of\nthe match. Ducasse intended this definition to rebut Hume\u2019s\nclaim that singular causal relations between particular events must be\nanalyzed in terms of regularities between types of events (and thus\nlaws). Indeed, Ducasse claimed that Hume was wrong to deny that we\nhave the ability to perceive singular causal relations\u2014this\ndenial being the basis for Hume\u2019s subsequent regularity account\n (see 3.3).\n For, according to Ducasse, we can perceive that some event is the\nonly change in the immediate environment of some subsequent event just\nprior to that event\u2019s occurrence. (We can, of course, be wrong\nin thinking that this is what we have in fact perceived. But as\nDucasse points out, the same problem plagues Hume\u2019s own\naccount\u2014we can be wrong that what we have perceived are\ninstances of types which bear a regular relation to each other. But\nthis does not lead Hume to hold that since we can\u2019t infallibly\nperceive that some succession is an instance of a regularity, we\ncannot form the concept of causality in terms of regularity. The same\nthus applies to Ducasse\u2019s own account.)\n\nDavidson notes the heavy dependence, in Ducasse\u2019s account, on\nthe notion of a \u2018change\u2019. And he asks whether we really\nhave a purchase on this concept absent appeal to laws. There are two\naspects of this concern. First, the notion of \u2018change\u2019 is\nshort for \u2018change of predicate\u2019\u2014a change occurs when\na predicate true of some object (or not true of that object) ceases to\nbe true (or comes to be true) of that object. And this leads directly\nto questions about how predicates are individuated and their\nrelationship to laws (see below). Second, and at a more general level,\nthe notion of \u2018change\u2019 has itself changed over\ntime\u2014for instance, Newtonian mechanics defines a change\ndifferently than Aristotelian physics, so that continuous motion\ncounts as a change, and thus requires an explanation, according to the\nlatter but not the former. Thus, the very notion of\n\u2018change\u2019 is theory dependent, and therefore (Davidson\nholds) presupposes the notion of \u2018law\u2019, in the sense that\nsomething counts as a change, and thus as having a cause, only against\na background of theoretical principles.\n\nThis second point does not appear to deliver the result Davidson is\nafter\u2014establishing that each causal interaction must be covered\nby a particular strict law. The claim that something is a change, and\nthus has a cause, only if certain theoretical assumptions are in place\nis consistent with the claim that those assumptions (for instance,\nthat uniform rectilinear motion does not count as a change) cannot\nplay the explanatory role for specific causal interactions that strict\nlaws are supposed to play. They are simply of too general a\nnature\u2014they don\u2019t enable predictions or explanations of\nany particular events. And in any case, there appears to be nothing in\nDavidson\u2019s considerations here that forces the requirement that\nthe covering laws be strict as opposed to irreducibly ceteris\nparibus. (As we have already seen\n (3.1),\n Davidson himself has insisted upon the legitimacy and ubiquity of\nsuch laws in scientific explanation.)\n\nReturning to the first point about predicate-individuation, Davidson\nclaims that \u201cit is just the predicates which are projectible,\nthe predicates that enter into valid inductions, that determine what\ncounts as a change\u201d (Davidson 1995a, 272). We know from Nelson\nGoodman\u2019s \u2018new riddle of induction\u2019 (Goodman 1983)\nthat we can invent predicates, such as \u2018grue\u2019 and\n\u2018bleen\u2019 (where an object is grue if it is green and\nexamined before 2020 or otherwise blue, and an object is bleen if it\nis blue and examined before 2020 or otherwise green) so that a green\nobject goes from being grue to bleen over the course of time without\nhaving changed in any intuitive sense. It will continue to be green,\nthough it will also be true that it ceases to be grue and comes to be\nbleen. Contrary to much discussion of Goodman\u2019s riddle, Davidson\nholds that such unusual predicates can be projectible, and figure in\nlaws, but only when appropriately paired with other such predicates (\n\u201cAll emeralds are grue\u201d is not lawlike, but \u201cAll\nemerires are grue\u201d is (where \u201cemerire\u201d is true of\nemeralds examined before 2020 or otherwise sapphires ). What is\ncrucial for Davidson is that to understand the notion of change, which\nis so closely tied to the notion of causation, one must understand the\nnotion of a projectible predicate\u2014one appropriate for use in\nscience\u2014and this notion inevitably brings in the notion of law.\nChanges are described by predicates suitable for inclusion within\nlaws. But how does this relate to the cause-law principle? Once again,\nit is unclear why Davidson would think that it is the notion of a\nstrict law in particular that this line of argument\nmotivates.\n\nA related line of argument that Davidson offers (see\n 4.3)\n appears to suggest that dispositional predicates\u2014those defined\nin terms of the effects they tend to bring about\u2014are not\nsuitable for inclusion in strict laws (generalizations in which they\nfigure are always qualified by a ceteris paribus clause), but\nthere must be strict laws at the bottom, so to speak, of the\ndispositional vocabulary. Davidson\u2019s discussion of this issue\nrefers back to an older debate about the status of dispositional\nterms\u2014specifically, whether they are \u2018place-holders\u2019\nfor predicates that are non-dispositional (\u2018intrinsic\u2019 or\n\u2018manifest\u2019) (see Goodman 1983, 41ff). Whatever one\u2019s\nview about that issue, it again does not appear that Davidson has\nprovided adequate argument for establishing that strict laws\n(as opposed to ceteris paribus laws) are required for our\ndispositional vocabulary to operate as it does. So Davidson does not\nappear to have provided the cause-law principle with a plausible\nrationale (for skepticism about the principle, see Anscombe 1971,\nCartwright 1983, McDowell 1985, Hornsby 1985 and 1993, and\n 3.3 below).\n This is not to say that it is false, or even that it is implausible\nto assume it in his argument for Anomalous Monism. Many find the\nprinciple highly intuitive, and it is worthwhile to explore its\nrelation to the other central claims in Davidson\u2019s\nframework.\n",
