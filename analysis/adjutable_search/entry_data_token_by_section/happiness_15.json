    "main_text": "The pursuit and promotion of happiness || Mistakes in the pursuit of happiness\n5.3 The politics of happiness\n\nJust a decade ago the idea of happiness policy was something of a\nnovelty. While it remains on the fringes in some locales, notably the\nUnited States, in much of the world there has been a surge of interest\nin making happiness an explicit target of policy consideration.\nAttention has largely shifted, however, to a broader focus on\nwell-being to reflect not just happiness but also other welfare\nconcerns of citizens, and dozens of governments now incorporate\nwell-being metrics in their national \nstatistics.[32] \n\nLet\u2019s consider the rationale for policies aimed at promoting\nwell-being. In political thought, the modern liberal tradition has\ntended to assume an optimistic view of human nature and the\nindividual\u2019s capacities for prudent choice. Partly for this\nreason, the preservation and expansion of individual freedoms,\nincluding people\u2019s options, is widely taken to be a central\ngoal, if not the goal, of legitimate governments. People\nshould be freed to seek the good life as they see it, and beyond that\nthe state should, by and large, stay out of the well-being-promotion\nbusiness.\n\nThis vision of the good society rests on empirical assumptions that\nhave been the subject of considerable debate. If it turns out that\npeople systematically and predictably err in the pursuit of their\ninterests, then it may be possible for governments to devise policies\nthat correct for such\n mistakes.[33]\n Of course, government intervention can introduce other sorts of\nmistakes, and there is some debate about whether such measures are\nlikely to do more harm than good (e.g., Glaeser 2006).\n\nBut even if governments cannot effectively counteract human\nimprudence, it may still be that people fare better in social forms\nthat influence or even constrain choices in ways that make serious\nmistakes less likely. (Food culture and its impact on health may be an\ninstructive example here.) The idea that people tend to fare best when\ntheir lives are substantially constrained or guided by their social\nand physical context has recently been dubbed contextualism;\nthe contrary view, that people do best when their lives are, as much\nas possible, determined by the individuals themselves, is\nindividualism (Haybron 2008b). Recent contextualists include\ncommunitarians and many perfectionists, though contextualism is not a\npolitical doctrine and is compatible with liberalism and even\nlibertarian political morality. Contextualism about the promotion of\nwell-being is related to recent work in moral psychology that\nemphasizes the social character of human agency, such as situationism\nand social\n intuitionism.[34]\n\nQuite apart from matters of efficacy, there are moral questions about\nthe state promotion of happiness, which has been a major subject of\ndebate, both because of the literature on mistakes and research\nsuggesting that the traditional focus of state efforts to promote\nwell-being, economic growth, has a surprisingly modest impact on\n happiness.\n One concern is paternalism: does happiness-based policy\ninfringe too much on personal liberty? Some fear a politics that may\ntoo closely approximate Huxley\u2019s Brave New World, where the\nstate ensures a drug-induced happiness for all (Huxley 1932 [2005]).\nExtant policy suggestions, however, have been more modest. Efforts to\nsteer choice, for instance in favor of retirement savings, may be\npaternalistic, but advocates argue that such policies can be\nsufficiently light-handed that no one should object to them, in some\ncases even going so far as to deem it \u201clibertarian\npaternalism\u201d (Thaler and Sunstein\n 2008).[35]\n The idea is that gentle \u201cnudges,\u201d like setting default\noptions on hiring forms to setting aside money for retirement,\ninterfere only trivially with choice, imposing little or no cost for\nthose who wish to choose differently, and would very likely be\nwelcomed by most of those targeted.\n\nAlso relatively light-handed, and perhaps not paternalistic at all,\nare state efforts to promote happiness directly through social policy,\nfor instance by prioritizing unemployment over economic growth on the\ngrounds that the former has a larger impact on happiness. Other\npolicies might include trying to reduce commute times, or making\nwalkable neighborhoods and green space a priority in urban planning,\nagain on happiness grounds. Some may deem such measures paternalistic\ninsofar as they trade freedom (in the form of economic prosperity) for\na substantive good, happiness, that people value unevenly, though it\nhas also been argued that refusing to take citizens\u2019 values like\nhappiness into consideration in policy deliberation on their behalf\ncan amount to paternalism (Haybron and Alexandrova 2013). \n\nA related sort of objection to happiness-based policy argues that\nhappiness, or even well-being, is simply the wrong object of policy,\nwhich ought instead to focus on the promotion of resources or\ncapabilities (Rawls 1971, Nussbaum 2000, Quong 2011, Sen 2009).\nSeveral reasons have been cited for this sort of view, one being that\npolicies aimed at promoting happiness or well-being violate commonly\naccepted requirements of \u201cliberal neutrality,\u201d according\nto which policy must be neutral among conceptions of the good.\nAccording to this constraint, governments must not promote any view of\nthe good life, and happiness-based policy might be argued to flout it.\nWorries about paternalism also surface here, the idea being that\nstates should only focus on affording people the option to be\nhappy or whatever, leaving the actual achievement of well-being up to\nthe autonomous individual. As we just saw, however, it is not clear\nhow far happiness policy initiatives actually infringe on personal\nliberty or autonomy. A further worry is that, happiness isn\u2019t\nreally, or primarily, what matters for human well-being (Nussbaum\n2008). \n\nBut a major motivation for thinking happiness the wrong object of\npolicy is that neither happiness nor well-being are the appropriate\nfocus of a theory of justice. What justice requires of\nsociety, on this view, is not that it make us happy; we do not have a\nright to be happy. Rather, justice demands only that each has\nsufficient opportunity (in the form of resources or capabilities, say)\nto achieve a good life, or that each gets a fair share of the benefits\nof social cooperation. However plausible such points may be, it is not\nclear how far they apply to many proposals for happiness-based policy,\nsave the strongest claims that happiness should be the sole\naim of policy: many policy decisions are not primarily concerned with\nquestions of social justice, nor with constitutional fundamentals, the\nfocus of some theories of justice. Happiness could be a poor candidate\nfor the \u201ccurrency\u201d of justice, yet still remain a major\npolicy concern. Indeed, the chief target of happiness policy advocates\nhas been, not theories of justice, but governments\u2019 overwhelming\nemphasis on promoting GDP and other indices of economic growth. This\nis not, in the main, a debate about justice, and as of yet the\nphilosophical literature has not extensively engaged with it.\n\nHowever, the push for happiness-based policy is a recent development.\nIn coming years, such questions will likely receive considerably more\nattention in the philosophical literature.\n",
