    "main_text": "Formal, Procedural and Substantive Requirements || Substantive Theories\n5.3 Substantive Theories\n\nThough many jurists follow Raz 1977 in thinking that the Rule of Law\nis a purely formal/procedural ideal, others believe in adding a more\nsubstantive dimension. They do not think it is possible to sharply\nseparate our political ideals in the way Raz seems to suppose. At the\nvery least, the formal/procedural aspects generate a certain momentum\nin a substantive direction. Generality\u2014proceeding according to a\nrule\u2014is often said to contain the germ of justice (Hart 1961:\nch. 8). And, stability, publicity, clarity, and prospectivity indicate\na pretty fundamental connection between the Rule of Law and the\nconditions of liberty. We have to be careful, however, to distinguish\nbetween allegedly substantive requirements of the Rule of Law and\nspecification of the deeper values that underlie and motivate the\nideal even in its formal and procedural requirements.\n\nSome jurists believe that there is a special affinity between the Rule\nof Law and the vindication and support of private property. Ronald\nCass (2004: 131) says that \u201c[a] critical aspect of the\ncommitment to the rule of law is the definition and protection of\nproperty rights\u201d. \n\n\n[T]he degree to which the society is bound by law, is committed to\nprocesses that allow property rights to be secure under legal rules\nthat will be applied predictably and not subject to the whims of\nparticular individuals, matters. The commitment to such processes is\nthe essence of the rule of law. Cass (2004: 131)\n\n\nOthers, like Richard Epstein (2011: 10), accept that\n\u201c[a]nalytically, the rule of law is \u2026 a separate\nconception from private property\u201d. But they think nevertheless\nthat a contingent connection between the Rule of Law and private\nproperty can be established by showing that the forms of regulation\ndefenders of private property are concerned about tend to be forms of\nregulation that the Rule of Law, even on a more austere conception,\nprohibits.\n\nIt is also widely believed\u2014though not necessarily by the same\npeople who associate legality with property\u2014that a system of\npositive law that fails to respect fundamental human rights should not\nbe dignified with the term \u201cthe Rule of Law\u201d. The World\nJustice Project in 2011 quoted Arthur Chaskalson, former Chief Justice\nof South Africa, to this effect:\n\n\n[T]he apartheid government, its officers and agents were accountable\nin accordance with the laws; the laws were clear; publicized, and\nstable, and were upheld by law enforcement officials and judges. What\nwas missing was the substantive component of the rule of law. The\nprocess by which the laws were made was not fair (only whites, a\nminority of the population, had the vote). And the laws themselves\nwere not fair. They institutionalized discrimination, vested broad\ndiscretionary powers in the executive, and failed to protect\nfundamental rights. Without a substantive content there would be no\nanswer to the criticism, sometimes voiced, that the rule of law is\n\u201can empty vessel into which any law could be poured\u201d.\n(World Justice Project 2011: 9)\n\n\nOn the other hand, as we have seen, Joseph Raz (1979 [1977]: 211) is\nfamous for insisting that \u201cthe rule of law is just one of the\nvirtues which a legal system may possess and by which it is to be\njudged\u201d, and that we should not try to read into it other\nconsiderations about democracy, human rights, and social justice.\nThose considerations, he said, are better understood as independent\ndimensions of assessment. Tom Bingham, in his book on The Rule of\nLaw, said this in response to Raz:\n\n\nWhile \u2026 one can recognize the logical force of Professor\nRaz\u2019s contention, I would roundly reject it in favor of a\n\u201cthick\u201d definition, embracing the protection of human\nrights within its scope. A state which savagely represses or\npersecutes sections of its people cannot in my view be regarded as\nobserving the rule of law, even if the transport of the persecuted\nminority to the concentration camp or the compulsory exposure of\nfemale children on the mountainside is the subject of detailed laws\nduly enacted and scrupulously observed. (Bingham 2010: 67)\n\n\nLord Bingham\u2019s position has an intuitive appeal in the eyes of\nmany commentators, even if it irritates in its casual rejection of a\npoint whose logic it claims to recognize.\n\nBoth Chaskalson and Bingham seem to want to fill out the formal/\nprocedural conception of the Rule of Law with some human rights\ncomponent. And many liberals are inclined to follow them in that. But\nthis is not the only possibility. Many associate the Rule of Law with\na presumption of liberty or the principle of human dignity.\nOthers\u2014Arthur Chaskalson hinted at this\u2014associate the Rule\nof Law with a substantive dimension of democracy. \n\nAll this sounds an analytic danger signal. Once we open up the\npossibility of the Rule of Law\u2019s having a substantive dimension,\nwe inaugurate a sort of competition in which everyone clamors to have\ntheir favorite political ideal incorporated as a substantive dimension\nof the Rule of Law. Those who favor property rights and market economy\nwill scramble to privilege their favorite values in this regard. But\nso will those who favor human rights, or those who favor democratic\nparticipation, or those who favor civil liberties or social justice.\nThe result is likely to be a general decline in political articulacy,\nas people struggle to use the same term to express disparate\nideals.\n",
