    "main_text": "Environmental Ethics and Politics || Social Ecology and Bioregionalism\n3.4 Social Ecology and Bioregionalism\n\nApart from feminist-environmentalist theories and N\u00e6ss\u2019s\ndeep ecology, Murray Bookchin\u2019s \u201csocial ecology\u201d has\nalso claimed to be radical, subversive, or countercultural (see\nBookchin 1980, 1987, 1990). Bookchin\u2019s version of critical\ntheory takes the \u201couter\u201d physical world as constituting\nwhat he calls \u201cfirst nature\u201d, from which culture or\n\u201csecond nature\u201d has evolved. Environmentalism, in his\nview, is a social movement, and the problems it confronts are social\nproblems. While Bookchin is prepared, like Horkheimer and Adorno, to\nregard (first) nature as an aesthetic and sensuous marvel, he regards\nour intervention in it as necessary. He suggests that we can choose to\nput ourselves at the service of natural evolution, to help maintain\ncomplexity and diversity, diminish suffering and reduce pollution.\nBookchin\u2019s social ecology recommends that we use our gifts of\nsociability, communication and intelligence as if we were\n\u201cnature rendered conscious\u201d, instead of turning them\nagainst the very source and origin from which such gifts derive.\nExploitation of nature should be replaced by a richer form of life\ndevoted to nature\u2019s preservation.\n\nJohn Clark has argued that social ecology is heir to a historical,\ncommunitarian tradition of thought that includes not only the\nanarchist Peter Kropotkin, but also the nineteenth century socialist\ngeographer Elis\u00e9e Reclus, the eccentric Scottish thinker\nPatrick Geddes and the latter\u2019s disciple, Lewis Mumford (Clark\n1998). Ramachandra Guha has described Mumford as \u201cthe pioneer\nAmerican social ecologist\u201d (Guha 1996, 210). Mumford adopted a\nregionalist perspective, arguing that strong regional centres of\nculture are the basis of \u201cactive and securely grounded local\nlife\u201d (Mumford 1944, 403). Like the pessimists in critical\ntheory, Mumford was worried about the emergence under industrialised\ncapitalism of a \u201cmegamachine\u201d, one that would oppress and\ndominate human creativity and freedom, and one that\u2014despite\nbeing a human product\u2014operates in a way that is out of our\ncontrol. While Bookchin is more of a technological optimist than\nMumford, both writers have inspired a regional turn in environmental\nthinking. Bioregionalism gives regionalism an environmental twist.\nThis is the view that natural features should provide the defining\nconditions for places of community, and that secure and satisfying\nlocal lives are led by those who know a place, have learned its lore\nand who adapt their lifestyle to its affordances by developing its\npotential within ecological limits. Such a life, the bioregionalists\nargue, will enable people to enjoy the fruits of self-liberation and\nself-development (see the essays in List 1993, and the book-length\ntreatment in Thayer 2003, for an introduction to bioregional\nthought).\n\nHowever, critics have asked why natural features should be significant\nin defining the places in which communities are to be built, and have\npuzzled over exactly which natural features these should\nbe\u2014geological, ecological, climatic, hydrological, and so on\n(see Brennan 1998b). If relatively small, bioregional communities are\nto be home to flourishing human societies, then a question also arises\nover the nature of the laws and punishments that will prevail in them,\nand also of their integration into larger regional and global legal,\npolitical and economic groupings. For anarchists and other critics of\nthe predominant social order, a return to self-governing and\nself-sufficient regional communities is often depicted as liberating\nand refreshing. But for the skeptics, the worry remains that the\nbioregional vision is politically over-optimistic and is open to the\nestablishment of illiberal, stifling and undemocratic communities.\nFurther, given its emphasis on local self-sufficiency and the virtue\nof life in small communities, a question arises over whether\nbioregionalism is workable in an overcrowded planet. Later bioregional\nproposals have identified ways of connecting with nature by showing\nstewardship for green infrastructure within cities (Andersson et al.\n2014).\n\nDeep ecology, feminism, and social ecology had a considerable impact\non the development of political positions in regard to the\nenvironment. Feminist analyses have often been welcomed for the\npsychological insight they bring to several social, moral and\npolitical problems. There is, however, considerable unease about the\nimplications of critical theory, social ecology and some varieties of\ndeep ecology and animism. Some writers have argued, for example, that\ncritical theory is bound to be ethically anthropocentric, with nature\nas no more than a \u201csocial construction\u201d whose value\nultimately depends on human determinations (see Vogel 1996). Others\nhave argued that the demands of \u201cdeep\u201d green theorists and\nactivists cannot be accommodated within contemporary theories of\nliberal politics and social justice (see Ferry 1998). A further\nsuggestion is that there is a need to reassess traditional theories\nsuch as virtue ethics, which has its origins in ancient Greek\nphilosophy (see the following section) within the context of a form of\nstewardship similar to that earlier endorsed by Passmore (see Barry\n1999). If this last claim is correct, then the radical activist need\nnot, after all, look for philosophical support in radical, or\ncountercultural, theories of the sort deep ecology, feminism,\nbioregionalism and social ecology claim to be (but see Zimmerman\n1994).\n",
