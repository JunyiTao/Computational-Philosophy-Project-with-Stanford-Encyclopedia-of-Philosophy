    "main_text": "Applications of Impossible Worlds || Fiction\n2.3 Fiction\n\nInconsistent information is at issue also in certain works of fiction.\nLewis\u2019s classic 1978 paper proposed an analysis of the\nexpression \u201ctrue in such-and-such fiction\u201d in terms of\npossible worlds. What holds in a certain fictional work is what holds\nat a set of possible worlds, properly selected via a series of (quite\nsubtle and complex) clauses. But fiction can be occasionally\ninconsistent. Sometimes, this happens unintentionally: Conan\nDoyle\u2019s The Sign of the Four describes Watson as\nlimping because of a war wound at his leg. In A Study in\nScarlet, however, Watson has no wound at his leg (for his wound\nis in his shoulder and he doesn\u2019t limp). One may claim that the\nset of worlds that make such stories true has to be split into\ndisjoint subsets, making true consistent fragments of the fiction.\nThis strategy won\u2019t always work, however, for inconsistencies in\nfiction may be intentional (as stressed in Proudfoot 2006). Suppose we\nwrite a novel, and in its first chapter we have the Mad Mathematician\nproduce a round square. If the intentional inconsistency is excised,\nthe fact that mathematicians all over the world are amazed by this\nresult in the second chapter becomes unexplainable. A natural\ntreatment of these cases, then, is obtained by admitting\n(appropriately selected) impossible worlds in the set of situations\nthat realize what is told in the story (see e.g. Priest 1997b; Woods\n2003, Chapter 6; Berto 2012, Chapters 7 and 8; Badura and Berto\n2019).\n",
