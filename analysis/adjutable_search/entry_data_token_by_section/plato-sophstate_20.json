    "main_text": "Method and Metaphysics in the Statesman || Weaving and Statecraft\n7.2 Weaving and Statecraft\n\n\nEarlier we observed (\u00a7 4.2) that the problems of definition to\nwhich the Sophist calls attention, though not unique to the\nsophist, are in his case partially explained by his essence. The same\nis true of the statesman. Why does the statesman have so many rivals?\nThat is the puzzle of the statesman. Reflection on the shortcomings of\nthe first division and the Myth eventually suggests a way\nforward. What is the special manner of the statesman\u2019s care\nas opposed to theirs? We have noticed that the inquirers tangle the\nthreads of theoretical and practical knowledge. This difficulty\narises, because statecraft, as we finally learn, involves both\ntheoretical and practical knowledge (cf. Statesman 284c,\n289c\u2013d, 305c\u2013d, 311b\u2013c). Because of the nature of\nhis expertise, the statesman is intimately connected with everyone\nengaged in the care of humans; he oversees and directs their\nactivities and uses their products and services in his own\nhigher-order activity. Perhaps the statesman somehow combines\ntheoretical and practical knowledge in managing the interactions of\nthe members of his flock. Indeed, perhaps his essence is or includes\nthe art of combining, like weaving (Statesman\n279a\u2013b). The last part of the dialogue recognizes this\nconnection and takes weaving as its paradigm.\n\n\nThe Stranger quickly presents a dichotomous division that yields the\nart of weaving and defines it as the art in charge of clothes\n(Statesman 279c\u2013280a). Like the definition of the\nstatesman reached in the first part of the dialogue, this definition,\nfor all its detail, is too general, since many arts compete for the\nsame title: carding, spinning, spindle-making, mending,\nclothes-cleaning, and others. The dichotomous division fails to\nisolate the mode of clothes-working peculiar to weaving.\n\n\nThe paradigm of weaving serves two main functions (on the paradigm of\nweaving, cf. El Murr 2002 and Blondell 2005). First, it introduces a\nnew procedure allowing the inquirers to differentiate the target from\nother arts akin to it, all located in the lowest kind reached by the\nprevious dichotomous division. As earlier noted (\u00a7 3.2), the new\nprocedure is division \u201cby limbs, like a sacrificial\nanimal\u201d (Statesman 287c) (for a different view of the\nStranger\u2019s strategy, see El Murr 2005). Whereas dichotomous division\nseparates a kind into two parts, and then ignores at each step the\npart that does not lead to the goal, division by limbs breaks off\npieces of an original whole, whose members are interrelated and\ncooperate in tending their common object. All the arts of\nclothes-working have clothes as their object. Many of the kindred arts\nprovide weaving with its tools or materials (these contributing arts\nare characterized as sunaitiai, \u201chelping\ncauses\u201d). The differentiation of weaving from various subsidiary\narts reveals a procedure to define statecraft in relation to the\nsubordinate arts.\n\n\nSecond, weaving exemplifies an essential feature shared with the\ntarget: both weaving and statecraft engage in intertwining. The\nstatesman weaves in a number of ways, and in particular weaves\ntogether into one fabric the virtues of courage and moderation, often\nat odds in a city. The statesman and the weaver have many other\nfeatures in common. Both are experts in measurement, measuring the\nmore and the less not merely in relation to each other but more\nimportantly in relation to some practical goal they aim to achieve\n(Statesman 284a\u2013e) (on the arts of measurement, see\nLane 1998, Delcomminette 2005, Lafrance 2005, and Sayre\n2006). Furthermore, the arts of both experts control the subsidiary\narts, whose products they use in their own activity\n(Statesman 308d\u2013e). The statesman directs the experts\nwho are, as it were, the practical arms of his expertise and\nespecially those identified as his closest kin: the orator, the\ngeneral, the judge, and the teacher. The statesman, an expert in\ntiming (see Lane 1998), determines when the general should go to war,\nthough he leaves it to the general to work out military strategy and\ncarry it out. He determines the good that rhetoric will serve but\nleaves the techniques and practice of persuasion to the\nrhetorician. He decides what is just and lawful but leaves it to the\njudges to implement his decisions (Statesman\n303e\u2013305d). The statesman must further determine what mix of\ncourage and moderation will most advance the good in the city, but he\ncalls on the teachers to instill in the youth the right belief about\nwhat is good (Statesman 308e\u2013310a). The visitor tells\nus that the statesman cares for every aspect of things in the city,\nweaving them together in the most correct way\n(Statesman 305e).\n",
