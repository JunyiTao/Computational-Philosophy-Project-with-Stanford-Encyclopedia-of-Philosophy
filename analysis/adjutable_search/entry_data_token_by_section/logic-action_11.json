    "main_text": "The Logic of Action in Artificial Intelligence || Representing and reasoning about actions\n4.2 Description and specification of intelligent agents\n\nIn the last two decades the notion of an intelligent agent has emerged as a unifying concept to discuss the theory and practice of artificial intelligence (cf. Russell and Norvig 1995, Nilsson 1998). In short, agents are software entities that display forms of intelligence/rationality and autonomy. They are able to take initiative and make decisions to take action on their own without direct control of a human user. In this subsection we will see how logic (of action) is used to describe / specify the (desired) behavior of agents (cf. Wooldridge 2002). First we focus on single agents, after which we turn to settings with multiple agents, called multi-agent systems (MAS) or even agent societies.\n4.2.1 Single agent approaches\n\nInterestingly, the origin of the intelligent agent concept lies in philosophy. \n\nFirst of all there is a direct link with practical reasoning in the classical philosophical tradition going back to Aristotle. Here one is concerned with reasoning about action in a syllogistic manner, such as the following example taken from Audi 1999, p. 729:\n\nWould that I exercise.\n\nJogging is exercise.\n\nTherefore, I shall go jogging.\n\n\nAlthough this has the form of a deductive syllogism in the familiar Aristotelian tradition of theoretical reasoning, on closer inspection it appears that this syllogism does not express a purely logical deduction. (The conclusion does not follow logically from the premises.) It rather constitutes a representation of a decision of the agent (going to jog), where this decision is based on mental attitudes of the agent, viz. his/her beliefs (jogging is exercise) and his/her desires or goals (would that I exercise). So, practical reasoning is reasoning directed toward action, the process of figuring out what to do, as Wooldridge (2000) puts it. The process of reasoning about what to do next on the basis of mental states such as beliefs and desires is called deliberation.\n\nDennett (1971) has put forward the notion of the intentional stance: the strategy of interpreting the behaviour of an entity by treating it as if it were a rational agent that governed its choice of action by a consideration of its beliefs and desires. As such it is an anthropomorphic instance of the so called design (functionality) stance, contra the physical stance, towards systems. This stance has been proved to be extremely influential, not only in cognitive science and biology/ethology (in connection with animal behavior), but also as a starting point of thinking about artificial agents.\n\nFinally, and most importantly, there is the work of the philosopher Michael Bratman (1987), which, although in the first instance aimed at human agents, lays the foundation of the BDI approach to artificial agents. In particular, Bratman makes a case for the incorporation of the notion of intention for describing agent behavior. Intentions play the important role of selection of actions that are desired, with a distinct commitment attached to the actions thus selected. Unless there is a rationale for dropping a commitment (such as the belief that an intention has been achieved already or the belief that it is impossible to achieve) the agent should persist / persevere in its commitment, stick to it, so to speak, and try realizing it,\n\nAfter Bratman\u2019s philosophy was published, researchers tried to formalize this theory using logical means. We mention here three well-known approaches. Cohen and Levesque (1991) tried to capture Bratman\u2019s theory in a linear-time style temporal logic where they added primitive operators for belief and goal as well as some operators to cater for actions, such as operators for expressing that an action is about to be performed \n\\((\\lhappens \\alpha)\\), has just been performed \\(\\ldone \\alpha)\\) and what agent is the actor of a primitive action (\\(\\lact i\\ \\alpha\\): agent \\(i\\) is the actor of \\(\\alpha\\)). From this basic set-up they build a framework in which ultimately the notion of intention is defined in terms of the other notions. In fact they define two notions: an intention_to_do and an intention_to_be. First they define the notion of an achievement goal (A-Goal): an A-Goal is something that is a goal to hold later, but is believed not to be true now. Then they define a persistent goal (P-Goal): a P-Goal is an A-Goal that is not dropped before it is believed to be achieved or believed to be impossible. Then the intention to do an action is defined as the P-Goal of having done the action, in a way such that the agent was aware of it happening. The intention to achieve a state satisfying \\(\\phi\\) is the P-Goal of having done some action that has \\(\\phi\\) as a result where the agent was aware of something happening leading to \\(\\phi\\), such that what actually happened was not something that the agent explicitly had not as a goal.\n\nNext there is Rao & Georgeff\u2019s formalization of BDI agents using the branching-time temporal logic CTL (Rao and Georgeff 1991, Rao and Georgeff 1998, Wooldridge 2000). On top of CTL they introduce modal operators for Belief \\((\\lbel)\\), Goal \\((\\lgoal)\\) (sometimes replaced by Desire \\((\\ldes)\\)) and Intention (of the to_be kind, \\(\\lintend\\)) as well as operators to talk about the success \\((\\lsucceeded(e))\\) and \nfailure \\((\\lfailed)\\) of elementary actions \\(e\\). So they do not try to define intention in terms of other notions, but rather introduce intention as a separate operator, of which the meaning is later constrained by \u2018reasonable\u2019 axioms. The formal semantics is based on Kripke models with accessibility relations between worlds for the belief, goal and intention operators. However, possible worlds here are complete time trees (modeling the various behaviors of the agent) on which CTL formulas are interpreted in the usual way. Next they propose a number of postulates/axioms that they find reasonable interactions between the operators, and constrain the models of the logic accordingly so that these axioms become validities. For example, they propose the formulas\n\\(\\lgoal(\\alpha) \\rightarrow \\lbel(\\alpha)\\)\nand\n\\(\\lintend(\\alpha) \\rightarrow \\lgoal(\\alpha)\\),\nfor a certain class of formulas \\(\\alpha\\), of which\n\\(\\alpha = \\mathop{\\mathbf{E}}(\\psi)\\) is a typical example. Here \\(\\mathop{\\mathbf{E}}\\) stands for the existential path quantifier in CTL. Rao and Georgeff also show that one can express commitment strategies in their logic. For example, the following expresses a \u2018single-minded committed\u2019 agent, that keeps committed to its intention until it believes it has achieved it or thinks it is impossible (which is very close to what we saw in the definition of intention in the approach of Cohen and Levesque):\n\n\\[\n\\lintend(\\mathop{\\mathbf{A}} \\mathbin{\\diamond} \\phi)\n\\rightarrow\n(\\lintend(\\mathop{\\mathbf{A}} \\mathbin{\\diamond} \\phi) \\luntil (\\lbel(\\phi) \\vee \\neg\\lbel(\\mathop{\\mathrm{E}} \\mathbin{\\diamond} \\phi)))\n\\]\n\n\nwhere \\(\\mathbf{A}\\) stands for the universal path quantifier in CTL.\n\nFinally there is the KARO approach by Van Linder et al. (Van der Hoek et al. 1998, Meyer et al. 1999), which takes dynamic logic as a basis instead of a temporal logic. First a core is built, consisting of the language of propositional dynamic logic augmented with modal operators for knowledge \\((\\mathbf{K})\\), belief \\((\\mathbf{B})\\) and desire \\((\\mathbf{D})\\) as well as an operator \\((\\mathbf{A})\\) that stands for ability to perform an action. Next the language is extended mostly by abbreviations (definitions in terms of the other operators) to get a fully-fledged BDI-like logic. The most prominent operators are:\n\n opportunity to do an action (meaning that there is a way the action can be executed leading to a next state)\n practical possibility to do an action with respect to an assertion (the conjunction of ability and opportunity of doing the action, together with the statement that the execution of the action leads to the truth of the assertion)\ncan do an action with respect to an assertion (knowing to have the practical possibility to do the action with respect to the assertion at hand)\nrealizability of an assertion (the existence of a plan, i.e. a sequence of atomic actions, which the agent has the practical possibility to perform with respect to the assertion at hand)\ngoal with respect to an assertion (the conjunction of the assertion being desirable, not true yet, but realizable)\npossibly intend to do an action with respect to an assertion (expressing that the agent can do the action with respect to the assertion of which he knows it to be a goal of his)\n\n\nThe framework furthermore has special actions \\(\\lcommit\\) and \\(\\luncommit\\) to control the agent\u2019s commitments. The semantics of these actions is such that the agent obviously can only commit to an action \\(\\alpha\\) if there is good reason for it, viz. that there is a possible intention of \\(\\alpha\\) with a known goal \\(\\phi\\) as result. Furthermore the agent cannot uncommit to a certain action \\(\\alpha\\) that is part of the agent\u2019s commitments, as long there is a good reason for it to be committed to \\(\\alpha\\), i.e. as long as there is some possible intention where \\(\\alpha\\) is involved. This results in having the following validities in KARO: (Here \\(\\mathbf{I}(\\alpha, \\phi)\\) denotes the possibly intend operator and \\(\\mathbf{Com}(\\alpha)\\) is an operator that expresses that the agent is committed to the action \\(\\alpha\\), which is similar to Cohen & Levesque\u2019s intention-to-do operator \\(\\lintend_1\\) in Cohen and Levesque 1990.)\n\n\\[\\begin{align*}\n&\\vDash \\mathbf{I}(\\alpha,\\phi) \\rightarrow \\langle \\lcommit(\\alpha)\\rangle \\mathbf{Com}(\\alpha) \\\\\n&\\vDash \\mathbf{I}(\\alpha,\\phi) \\rightarrow \\neg \\mathbf{A} \\luncommit(\\alpha) \\\\\n&\\vDash \\mathbf{Com}(\\alpha) \\rightarrow \\langle\\luncommit(\\alpha)\\rangle \\neg \\mathbf{Com}(\\alpha) \\\\\n&\\vDash \\mathbf{Com}(\\alpha_1 \\ ;\\ \\alpha_2) \\rightarrow \\mathbf{KCom}(\\alpha_1) \\wedge \\mathbf{K}[\\alpha_1]\\mathbf{Com}(\\alpha_2)\n\\end{align*}\\]\n\n\nInformally these axioms say the following: if the agent possibly intends an action for fulfilling a certain goal then it has the opportunity to commit to this action, after which it is recorded on its agenda; as long as an agent possibly intends an action it is not able to uncommit to it (this reflects a form of persistence of commitments: as long as there is a good reason for a plan on the agenda it will have to stay on!); if the agent is committed to an action it has the opportunity to uncommit to it (but it may lack the ability to do this, cf. the previous axiom); if an agent is committed to a sequence of two actions then it knows that it is committed to the first and it also knows that after performing the first action it will be committed to the second.\n\nBesides this focus on motivational attitudes in the tradition of agent logics in BDI style, the KARO framework also provides an extensive account of epistemic and doxastic attitudes. This is worked out most completely in Van Linder et al. 1995. This work hooks into a different strand of research in between artificial intelligence and philosophy, viz. Dynamic Epistemic Logic, the roots of which lie in philosophy, linguistics, computer science and artificial intelligence! Dynamic Epistemic Logic (DEL) is the logic of knowledge change; it is not about one particular logical system, but about a whole family of logics that allow us to specify static and dynamic aspects of knowledge and beliefs of agents (cf. Van Ditmarsch et al. 2007). The field combines insights from philosophy (about belief revision, AGM-style (AGM 1985), as we have seen in Section 1), dynamic semantics in linguistics and the philosophy of language (as we have seen in Section 2), reasoning about programs by using dynamic logic (as we have seen in Section 3) with ideas in artificial intelligence about how knowledge and actions influence each other (Moore 1977). More generally we can see the influence of the logical analysis of information change as advocated by van Benthem and colleagues (van Benthem 1989, van Benthem 1994, Faller et al. 2000). Also Veltman\u2019s update semantics of default reasoning (Veltman 1996), an important reasoning method in artificial intelligence (Reiter 1980, Russell and Norvig 1995), can be viewed as being part of this paradigm.\n\nFor the purpose of this entry, it is interesting to note that the general approach taken is to apply a logic of action, viz. dynamic logic, to model information change. This amounts to an approach in which the epistemic (or doxastic) updates are reified into the logic as actions that change the epistemic/doxastic state of the agent. So, for example in Van Linder et al. 1995 we encounter the actions such as \\(\\lexpand(\\phi)\\), \\(\\lcontract(\\phi)\\), \\(\\lrevise(\\phi)\\), referring to expanding, contracting and revising, respectively, one\u2019s belief with the formula \\(\\phi\\). These can be reasoned about by putting them in dynamic logic boxes and diamonds, so that basically extensions of dynamic logic are employed for reasoning about these updates. It is further shown that these actions satisfy the AGM postulates so that this approach can be viewed as a modal counterpart of the AGM framework. Very similar in spirit is the work of Segerberg (1995) on Dynamic Doxastic Logic (DDL), the modal logic of belief change. In DDL modal operators of the form [\\(+\\phi\\)], [*\\(\\phi\\)] and [\\(-\\phi\\)] are introduced with informal meanings: \u201cafter the agent has expanded/revised/contracted his beliefs by \\(\\phi\\)\u201d, respectively. Combined with the \u2018standard\u2019 doxastic operator \\(B\\), where \\(B\\phi\\) is interpreted as \u201c\\(\\phi\\) is in the agent\u2019s belief set\u201d, one can now express properties like [\\(+\\phi]B\\psi\\) expressing that after having expanded its beliefs by \\(\\phi\\) the agent believes \\(\\psi\\) (also cf. Hendricks and Symons 2006).\n\nFinally in this subsection we mention recent work where the KARO formalism is used as a basis for describing also other aspects of cognitive behavior of agents, going \u2018beyond BDI\u2019, viz. attitudes regarding emotions (Meyer 2006, Steunebrink et al. 2007, Steunebrink et al. 2012). The upshot of this approach is that an expressive logic of action such as KARO can be fruitfully employed to describe how emotions such as joy, gratification, anger, and remorse, are triggered by certain informational and motivational attitudes such as certain beliefs and goals (\u2018emotion elicitation\u2019) and how, once elicited, the emotional state of an agent may influence its behavior, and in particular its decisions about the next action to take.\n4.2.2 Multi-agent approaches\n\nApart from logics to specify attitudes of single agents, also work has been done to describe the attitudes of multi-agent systems as wholes. First we mention the work by Cohen & Levesque in this direction (Levesque et al. 1990, Cohen and Levesque 1991). This work was a major influence on a multi-agent version of KARO (Aldewereld et al. 2004). An important complication in a notion of joint goal involves that of persistence of the goal: where in the single agent case the agent pursues its goal until it believes it has achieved it or believes it can never be achieved, in the context of multiple agents, the agent that realizes this, has to inform the others of the team about it so that the group/team as a whole will believe that this is the case and may drop the goal. This is captured in the approaches mentioned above. Related work, but not a logic of action in the strict sense, concerns the logical treatment of collective intentions (Keplicz and Verbrugge 2002).\n\nIt must also be mentioned here that inspired by several sources among which the work on knowledge and belief updates for individual agents as described by DEL and DDL, combined with work on knowledge in groups of agents such as common knowledge (see, e.g., Meyer and Van der Hoek 1995), a whole new subfield has arisen, which can be seen as the multi-agent (counter)part of Dynamic Epistemic Logic. This deals with matters such as the logic of public announcement, and more generally actions that have effect on the knowledge of groups of agents. This has generated quite some work by different authors such as Plaza (1989), Baltag (1999), Gerbrandy (1998), Van Ditmarsch (2000), and Kooi (2003). For example, public announcement logic (Plaza 1989) contains an operator of the form [\\(\\phi]\\psi\\), where both \\(\\phi\\) and \\(\\psi\\) are formulas of the logic, expressing \u201cafter announcement of \\(\\phi\\), it holds that \\(\\psi\\)\u201d. This logic can be seen as a form of dynamic logic again, where the semantic clause for [\\(\\phi]\\psi\\) reads (in informal terms): [\\(\\phi]\\psi\\) is true in a model-state pair iff the truth of \\(\\phi\\) in that model-state pair implies the truth of \\(\\psi\\) in a model-state pair, where the state is the same, but the model is transformed to capture the information contained in \\(\\phi\\). Also in the other approaches the transformation of models induced by communicated information plays an important role, notably in the approach by Baltag et al. on action models (Baltag 1999, Baltag and Moss 2004). A typical element in this approach is that in action model logic one has both epistemic and action models and that the update of an epistemic model by an epistemic action (an action that affects the epistemic state of a group of agents) is represented by a (restricted) modal product of that epistemic model and an action model associated with that action. (See Van Ditmarsch et al. 2007, p. 151; this book is a recent comprehensive reference to the field.)\n\nFinally we mention logics that incorporate notions from game theory to reason about multi-agent systems, such as game logic, coalition logic (Pauly 2001) and alternating temporal logic (ATL, which we also encountered at the end of the section on mainstream computer science!), and its epistemic variant ATEL (Van der Hoek and Wooldridge 2003, Van der Hoek et al. 2007). For instance, game logic is an extension of PDL to reason about so-called determined 2-player games. Interestingly there is a connection between these logics and the stit approach we have encountered in philosophy. For instance, Broersen, partially jointly with Herzig and Troquard, has shown several connections such as embeddings of Coalition Logic and ATL in forms of stit logic (Broersen et al. 2006a,b) and extensions of stit (and ATL) to cater for reasoning about interesting properties of multi-agent systems (Broersen 2009, 2010). This area currently is growing fast, also aimed at the application of verifying multi-agent systems (cf. Van der Hoek et al. 2007), viz. Dastani et al. 2010. The latter constitutes still somewhat of a holy grail in agent technology. On the one hand there are many logics to reason about both single and multiple agents, while on the other hand multi-agent systems are being built that need to be verified. To this day there is still a gap between theory and practice. Much work is being done to render logical means combining the agent logics discussed and the logical techniques from mainstream computer science for the verification of distributed systems (from section 3), but we are not there yet\u2026!\nConclusion\n\nIn this entry we have briefly reviewed the history of the logic of action, in philosophy, in linguistics, in computer science and in artificial intelligence. Although the ideas and techniques we have considered were developed in these separate communities in a quite independent way, we feel that they are nevertheless very much related, and by putting them together in this entry we hope we have contributed in a modest way to some cross-fertilization between these communities regarding this interesting and important subject.\n",
