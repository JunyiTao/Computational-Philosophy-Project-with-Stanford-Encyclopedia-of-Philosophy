The Commentaries of the Book of Changes\n2.1 The Cosmological Approach\n\nThese four aspects of the Changes text\u2014the human\nfinitude, the decision making, the symbols, and the rituals\u2014were\nthe bases upon which the Changes commentators philosophized\nchange throughout imperial China. Over the two thousand years after\nthe canonization of the Changes in 135 BCE, commentators\ndeveloped three distinct approaches toward changes\u2014the\ncosmological approach, the rational humanistic approach, and the\ndivination approach. Now, let us first turn to the cosmology of\nchange.\n\nAfter its canonization in 125 BCE, the Changes text was\nsealed but its meaning continued to grow and expand in the following\ntwo thousand years, as readers repeatedly interpreted the classic to\nrespond to challenges of their times. By writing commentaries to\nexplicate the subtle meanings of the Changes, readers\ndeveloped what Hans-Georg Gadamer calls a \u201cfusion of\nhorizons\u201d (Gadamer 1989: 3\u201391; Tracy 1987: 1\u201327),\nwhere they responded to the \u201ccall to attention\u201d from the\nChanges in finding answers to questions that perplexed them.\nThroughout imperial China from the 2nd century BCE to 1911 CE,\nwhenever there were momentous changes in the socio-political order,\nthe Changes attracted tremendous attention as a living text\nthat offered insights and inspirations to those who were suppressed,\noppressed, or felt downtrodden.\n\nDuring the Han Dynasty (202 BCE \u2013 220 CE), when China was first\nunified for a long period of time, the dominant trend in interpreting\nthe Changes was the Images and Numbers (Xiangshu\n\u8c61\u6578) School. Focusing on the hexagram images and the\nsequence of hexagrams, the Images and Numbers School attracted the\nattention of the ruling elite who were preoccupied with building an\neternal empire. For the ruling elite, they felt that they had a\nmission to build a socio-political system that not only mimicked the\nrecurrent pattern of the universe but also responded proactively to\nthe ebb and flow of cosmic forces (Pines 2009, 2012; Loewe 1994, 2005;\nWang 2000).\n\nWhat underpinned the Numbers and Images School was a correlative\ncosmology. By aligning the hexagrams to depict the ebb and flow of the\ncosmic forces, the Numbers and Images School demonstrated what Sarah\nQueen calls the \u201cmutual responsiveness of heaven and\nhumanity\u201d (Queen 1996: 1\u201353). This mutual responsiveness\nwas based on two assumptions. First, the cosmos is orderly and stable.\nIts orderliness and stability are shown in the regular succession in\ntime, such as the four seasons, the twelve months, the 365 days.\nSecond, the same orderliness of the natural world is found in the\nhuman realm in the forms of life cycles, the rhythm of work and rest,\nand the rise and fall of family fortunes. Despite the vicissitudes on\nthe surface, the natural and human worlds are balanced, systematic and\npredictable. They are perfect mirrors of each other, such that when\none moves, the other responds.\n\nThe goal of correlative cosmology was not to develop a comprehensive\nunderstanding of the universe. Rather, it was to legitimize the\ntransition \u201cfrom the concept of imperial sovereignty based on\nmight into the need to support a claim to rule with intellectual\nsanctions\u201d (Loewe 1994: 121\u201341). Thus, the emperor was\nsaid to be the crucial link between the natural and human realms. In\nfact, according to the Han scholar Dong Zhongshu\n\u8463\u4ef2\u8212 (ca. 195\u2013105 BCE), the Chinese\ncharacter for king (\u738b) reflected the solemn responsibility of\nthe emperor (symbolized by the vertical stroke in the middle) for\nconnecting the three potencies \u2630: heaven (tian), earth\n(di) and humankind (ren) (Redmond & Hon 2014:\n159\u201361). As such, the emperor was indeed the Son of Heaven\n(tianzi) who was omnicompetent, omnipotent and omniscient\n(Loewe 2011; Queen 1996).\n\nTo support absolutism, Han commentators transformed the\nChanges into a cosmological manual reflecting the ebb and\nflow of cosmic forces. They earnestly reorganized the hexagram\nsequence to match the cosmic rhythm, demonstrating that the natural\nand human realms are one and the same. Although most of the writings\nof the Han commentators are lost, in an 8th-9th\ncentury text, Zhouyi jijie \u5468\u6613\u96c6\u89e3\n(A Collection of Explanations on the Changes of Zhou Dynasty)\nedited by Li Dingzuo \u674e\u9f0e\u795a, we have glimpses of the\nambition of the Han commentators who spent their lives fathoming the\ncosmos and ordering the world (R. Smith 2008: 57\u201388).\n\nFor instance, Jing Fang (77\u201337 BCE) created the Hexagrams of\nEight Palaces (ba gong gua): Qian\u4dc0,\nKun \u4dc1, Zhen \u4df2, Xun \u4df8,\nKan \u4ddc, Li \u4ddd, Gen \u4df3,\nDui \u4df9. These eight palace hexagrams are the doubles of\nthe eight trigrams. For Jing, each of these palace hexagrams leads a\ngroup of seven hexagrams. For example, Qian \u4dc0 leads\n\u4deb, \u4de0, \u4dcb, \u4dd3, \u4dd6, \u4de2, \u4dcd.\nIn this new alignment of hexagrams, there is both a steady increase or\ndecrease of the yin and yang cosmic forces, and the\nthe hidden power of the two forces even when they are dormant (for the\nnew sequence of 64 hexagrams based on eight palaces, see Nielson 2003:\n3).\n\nAnother new sequence of hexagrams was the \u201cwaning and waxing\nhexagrams\u201d (xiaoxi gua \u6d88\u606f\u5366)\nperfected by Yu Fan (164\u2013233). Representing the ebb and flow of\nthe yin and yang cosmic forces, the \u201cwaning\nand waxing hexagrams\u201d go as follows:\n\n\nFu\n\n\u4dd7[24]\n \u2192\n\n\nLin\n\n\u4dd2[19]\n \u2192\n\n\nTai\n\n\u4dca[11]\n \u2192\n\n\nDazhuang\n\n\u4de1[34]\n \u2192\n\n\nGuai\n\n\u4dea[43]\n \u2192\n\n\nQian\n\n\u4dc0[1]\n \u2192\n\n\nGou\n\n\u4deb[44]\n \u2192\n\n\nDun\n\n\u4de0[33]\n \u2192\n\n\nPi\n\n\u4dcb[12]\n \u2192\n\n\nGuan\n\n\u4dd3[20]\n \u2192\n\n\nBo\n\n\u4dd6[23]\n \u2192\n\n\nKun\n\n\u4dc1[2]\n \u2192\n\n\n(back to Fu)\n\n\n\nWhen reading from Fu to Qian, the yang\nforce gradually increases while the yin force decreases. When\nreading from Gou to Kun, the yin force\nincreases while the yang force decreases. As a system, the\ntwelve hexagrams are continuous. When the series ends with\nKun, it begins anew with Fu (Nielson 2003:\n275\u201376).\n\nBy developing these new hexagram sequences, the Han Changes\ncommentators wanted to achieve two goals. First, they freed themselves\nfrom the original sequence of the 64 hexagrams that was, to them,\nincoherent and inconsistent. To the Han commentators, the problem of\nthe original sequence was its failure in lining up hexagrams in\naccordance with their graphic images. By creating new sequences, the\nHan scholars were able to match perfectly the hexagram images with the\nebb and flow of cosmic forces (Redmond & Hon 2014: 159\u2013163).\nSecond, with the new sequences, the Han commentators were better\nequipped to synchronize the hexagrams with the lunar calendar, showing\na direct correspondence between the ebb and flow of the cosmic forces\nand the cycles of life in human society (R. Smith 2008: 62\u201377).\nFor instance, the \u201cwaning and waxing hexagrams\u201d were\nassigned to represent months in the lunar calendar (Nielson 2003:\n275\u201376):\n\n\n\nFu\n\u4dd7\nthe eleventh month \n\nLin\n\u4dd2\nthe twelfth month \n\nTai\n\u4dca\nthe first month of the following year \n\nDazhuang\n\u4de1\nthe second month \n\nGuai\n\u4dea\nthe third month \n\nQian\n\u4dc0\nthe fourth month \n\nGou\n\u4deb\nthe fifth month \n\nDun\n\u4de0\nthe sixth month \n\nPi\n\u4dcb\nthe seventh month \n\nGuan\n\u4dd3\nthe eighth month \n\nBo\n\u4dd6\nthe ninth month \n\nKun\n\u4dc1\nthe tenth month  \n\n\nThe same could be done for the hexagrams sequence based on the eight\npalaces. By matching the new sequence of the 64 hexagrams with 12\nmonths, the Han commentators allotted eight months to four hexagrams\nand four months to eight hexagrams (Nielson 2003: 5).\n\nTo Han commentators, while the new hexagram sequences highlighted\ncertainty in the universe\u2019s self-renewal, each hexagram\nrepresented the possibility of coping with the changing environment.\nThese differing functions addressed a fundamental question in ruling a\nhuge empire: How to formulate flexible policies while keeping a\nsemblance of unity and uniformity? To give themselves flexibility in\ninterpreting hexagrams, the Han commentators created new interpretive\nstrategies. One common strategy called for linking one hexagram to\nfour hexagrams. Take, for instance, Qian \u4dc0 (The\nCreative, #1). To interpret the hexagram, one can link it to its\nopposite, Kun \u4dc1 (The Receptive, #2), known as\n\u201claterally linked hexagrams\u201d (pangtong) (Nielson\n2003: 185\u201388). In addition, Qian can also be read along\nwith its preceding hexagram and following hexagram in accordance with\nthe sequence of the \u201cwaning and waxing hexagrams\u201d. So,\nQian can be read in relation to Guai \u4dea\n(Resolution, #43), its antecedent, and Gou \u4deb\n(Encounter, #44), its posterior. And then, within a hexagram, one can\nalso create \u201cinterlocking trigrams\u201d (hugua or\nhuti), that is, using four or five of the hexagram lines to\nform two new trigrams (Nielson 2003: 111\u201314). In the case\nofQian, it is not possible to create \u201cinterlocking\ntrigrams\u201d due to all six lines being yang. But in other\ncases, the \u201cinterlocking trigrams\u201d are significant in\ndeciphering the meaning of a hexagram. Take, for instance, Ge\n\u4df0 (Radical Change, #49). Its second, third, and fourth lines\nform a Sun trigram \u2634 and its third, four, and fifth\nform a Qian trigram \u2630 Combining Sun and\nQian forms Gou \u4deb (Encounter, #44).\n\nAnother strategy of expanding the scope of interpretation was to turn\na hexagram into a different one by transposing some of its lines.\nKnown as \u201cchanging the positions of hexagram lines\u201d\n(yiwei), this strategy allowed Han scholars to introduce\nother hexagrams when having problems interpreting a hexagram. For\ninstance, Tai \u4dca (Peace, #11) can become Jiji\n\u4dfe (Ferrying Complete #63) by transposing its second line (a\nyang) and its fifth line (a yin). Likewise,\nDazhuang \u4de1 (Great Strength, #34) can turn into\nXu \u4dc4 (Waiting, #5) by switching its fourth line (a\nyang) and its fifth line (a yin). Much more\nversatile than other methods, the transposition of hexagram lines gave\nHan commentators the liberty to inject a broad range of alternatives\nwhen interpreting a hexagram.\n\nThus, by giving themselves flexibility in interpreting hexagrams, the\nHan commentators reaffirmed the orderliness, stability, and\npredictability of the cosmic and human realms. They transformed the\nChanges into a cosmological manual to match the rhythm of\ncosmic forces. In doing so, the Han commentators suppressed and\nexternalized the human fear of uncertainty. They suppressed fear by\nfocusing attention on the repeated rhythm of the universe, as\nevidenced by the seasonal changes and the passage of time from month\nto month. They externalized fear by concentrating on the grand scheme\nof the universe\u2019s renewal that did not seem to give room to\nuncertainty or rupture. More importantly, by matching the cosmic realm\nwith the human rhythm, they created an illusion that the\nChanges was a ruler\u2019s playbook to fathom the cosmos and\norder the world (Ch\u2019en 1986: 798\u2013801; R. Smith 2008:\n62\u201388).\n2.2 The Rational Humanistic Approach\n\nBut the fall of the Han dynasty in 220 CE reveals a fundamental\nproblem of correlative cosmology, namely, human beings are incapable\nof fully discerning the cosmic pattern, nor can they completely apply\nthe cosmic pattern to human affairs. Even if they tried to mimic the\ncosmic rhythm in governing the human world, the human world is far too\ncomplicated for anyone to handle. In the following seven hundred\nyears, Changes scholars retreated from fathoming the cosmos.\nInstead, they turned their attention to ordering the human world and\nlooked for its deep structure.\n\nThe major figure who started this turn to the human world was Wang Bi\n\u738b\u5f3c (226\u2013249). Born six years after the collapse of\nthe Han dynasty, Wang Bi was thrown into a situation in which there\nseemed to be few certainties in life. With China divided into three\nseparate kingdoms\u2014the Wei, the Shu, and the Wu\u2014there was\nwidespread disorder in the country. When everything was in ruin, fewer\nand fewer people followed the Confucian precepts of honesty, loyalty,\nand filial piety. Instead, trickery, usurpation and pragmatic\ncalculation became the accepted strategies for survival. Apparently,\nWang Bi\u2019s experience after the collapse of the Han dynasty\nbrought him face to face with fear and anxiety\u2014the two recurrent\nthemes in the Changes (Hon 2010). Before his premature death\nat the age of 23, Wang wrote a commentary on the Changes\nalong with a commentary on the Laozi. Attached to his\nChanges commentary, the Zhouyi zhu\n\u5468\u6613\u6ce8 (A Commentary on the Zhou Changes),\nwere seven essays in which he discussed how to read the classic. In\nthese essays (rendered as \u201cGeneral Remarks on the Changes of\nthe Zhou\u201d by Richard John Lynn, see Lynn 1994:\n25\u201339), he revisited themes that had been discussed in the\nXici, including what a hexagram symbolizes and what the six\nlines of a hexagram tell us about human existence. In these essays, he\npresented a notion of change that was completely new.\n\nFirst and foremost, unlike the Han commentators, Wang Bi did not\nconsider the hexagram sequence as important. Instead, he regards each\nof the 64 hexagrams as a discrete situation. Furthermore, he points\nout that the uniqueness of each hexagram is succinctly summarized in\nTuan (one of the \u201cTen Wings\u201d), such as\nZhun \u4dc2 (Difficulty at the Beginning #3) discusses the\ndifficulty when someone starts an endeavor, Meng \u4dc3\n(Youthful Folly, #4) focuses on how a teacher hone his or her skills\nin teaching; Xu \u4dc4 (Waiting #5) suggests a pause to\nreflect on one\u2019s precarious situation (\u201cMing Tuan\u201d,\nLynn 1994: 25\u201327). As such, readers do not have to strictly\nfollow the hexagram sequence in reading hexagrams. They can pick and\nchoose hexagrams that appear to directly address questions in mind. No\nmatter which hexagrams they pick, the key point is to see a hexagram\nas a field of action where different forces or players interact.\n\nIn his essay \u201cMing Xiang\u201d \u660e\u8c61 (Clarifying the\nImages), Wang Bi explains why he wants to change the way of reading\nthe Yijing. He writes:\n\n\nImages are the means to express ideas. Words are the means to explain\nthe images. To yield up ideas completely, there is nothing better than\nthe images, and to yield up the meaning of images, there is nothing\nbetter than words. The words are generated by the images, thus one can\nponder the words and so observe what the images are. The images are\ngenerated by ideas, thus one can ponder the images and so observe what\nthe ideas are. The ideas are yielded up completely by the images, and\nthe images are made explicit by the words. Thus since the words are\nthe means to explain the images, once one gets the images, he forgets\nthe words, and since the images are the means to allow us to\nconcentrate on the ideas, once one gets the ideas, he forgets the\nimages. (Lynn 1994: 31)\n\n\nHere, Wang Bi is criticizing the Han exegetes for believing a direct\ncorrespondence exists between symbols and reality, words and\nreferents. For him, the Han exegetes are doomed to failure in using\nthe 64 hexagrams to match the unfolding of the universe. Given the\nscope and scale of the universe, whatever system of knowledge that the\nHan exegetes create will not be able to include all the animate and\ninanimate beings, nor can it capture the fluidity and diversity in the\nconstant transformation in the universe. Furthermore, the repeated\npatterns that the Han exegetes identify are merely what human beings\nobserve or experience; they are not the \u201creal cosmic\npatterns\u201d that the universe follows, as the frequent appearance\nof anomalies, calamities, disasters, and unexplained events\ndemonstrate. For this reason, Wang Bi suggested that \u201conce one\ngets the images, he forgets the words\u201d (dexiang zai\nwangyan \u5f97\u8c61\u5728\u5fd8\u8a00) and \u201conce\none gets the ideas, he forgets the images\u201d (deyi er\nwangxiang \u5f97\u610f\u800c\u5fd8\u8c61).\n\nIn the latter part of the essay, Wang borrows the Zhuangzi metaphors\nof \u201crabbit snares\u201d (ti \u8e44) and \u201cfish\ntrap\u201d (quan \u7b4c) to underscore the need to look at\nreality without being distracted by words or images. He writes:\n\n\nSimilarly, the rabbit snare exists for the sake for the rabbit; once\none gets the rabbit, he forgets the snare. And the fish trap exists\nfor the sake of fish; once one gets the fish, he gets the trap. If\nthis is so, then the words are snares for the images, and the images\nare traps for the ideas. (Lynn 1994: 31)\n\n\nFor Wang Bi, \u201cimages\u201d (xiang \u8c61) are traps\nbecause they give us a false sense of reality, confusing a\nrepresentation of reality with the reality itself. Particularly in the\nHan period, the commentators of the Changes deployed the\nhexagrams to depict the rise and fall Yin and Yang forces, as if the\nsequence of hexagrams could accurately map the unfolding of the\nuniverse. In a sarcastic tone, Wang questions the effectiveness of\nusing the hexagrams to mimic the cosmic patterns. He writes:\n\n\nIf the lines really do fit with the idea of compliance, why is it\nnecessarily that hexagram Kun \u5764 (The Receptive, #2)\nrepresent only the cow; and if its concept really corresponds to the\nidea of dynamism, why is it necessary that hexagram Qian\n\u4e7e (The Creative, #1) represent only the horse? (Lynn 1994:\n32)\n\n\nWorse still, when the matching of hexagrams with the unfolding of the\nuniverse did not work, the Han exegetes created even more methods,\nsuch as \u201coverlapping trigrams\u201d and \u201ctrigram\nchange\u201d, to make the correspondence look tenable (Lynn 1994:\n32). For Wang Bi, when more of these methods are created, more gaps\nand exceptions will appear in human systems of knowledge, showing\ntheir falsity and inadequacy.\n\nWang Bi\u2019s goal in critiquing the Han exegetes was to put forward\na new method of reading the text. Rather than creating a system of\nhuman knowledge that matched the vast scope and scale of the universe,\nWang suggested that we should accept the limit of our\nknowledge\u2014namely, we only know what we can know. We know that\nthe universe is a totality, but we can only apprehend its grand unity\nin our daily life and through our surroundings. Because of our\nfinitude, we should see hexagrams as symbols helping us to link with\nthe universe. They are pointers, in the form of temporal-spatial\ngrids, that reveal the totality of the universe in the concrete\nsituation of our life. As such, whichever hexagram is picked, it will\nprovoke a conversation between the symbol and the reader, allowing the\nreader to see the field of action in front of him.\n\nThus, for Wang Bi, the purpose of reading hexagrams is to reflect on\none\u2019s situation (see \u201cMingyao tongbian\u201d\n\u660e\u723b\u901a\u8b8a, Lynn 1994: 27\u201329). The six\nlines of a hexagram\u2014even a bad one like Gu \u4dd1\n(Ills to Be Cured, #18)\u2014offer options to respond to a situation.\nThey represent the room to maneuver within a system or the\npossibilities of altering an existing power structure. Precisely in\nthis juncture that exists between what is already set and what can be\nchanged, Wang Bi sees the fluidity of human affairs. With proper\naction, one can turn what appears to be a failure into a blessing.\nConversely, lacking appropriate action, one can make what appears to\nbe flourishing into a disaster.\n\nFor this reason, Wang Bi does not find the inauspicious hexagram\nSun \u4de8 (Diminution, #41) terribly frightening (Lynn\n1994: 387\u201396). Judging from its hexagram image and line\nstatements, Sun suggests a situation where those who are high\nup take advantage of those who are in lower positions, or those who\nare physically strong victimize those who are weak. Yet, despite the\ninjustice denoted in the hexagram, Wang Bi believes there is still\nroom for optimism. \u201cSupreme good fortune\u201d will come, he\ndeclares, if someone finds ways to benefit the public. Similarly, the\n\u201coppressions\u201d in hexagram Kun \u4dee (Impasse,\n#47) are avoidable (Lynn 1994: 428\u201337). Judging from its line\nstatements, Kun is hopeless. All of its six lines are plagued\nwith some form of oppression: the first line is buried under a barren\ntree, the second line is burdened with excessive drinking and eating,\nthe third line is caught in rocks, the fourth line is locked in a\ngolden carriage, the fifth line is bullied by a man with purple knee\nbands, and the sixth line is wrapped by creeping vines. Yet Wang Bi\nargues that by making the right decision one can reverse what seems to\nbe an oppressive situation into an opportunity for growth and\nadvancement.\n\nBy stressing human agency and activism, Wang Bi sees hexagrams as\npointers, directing our attention to the source of human creativity\nand ingenuity. As pointers, hexagrams and hexagram lines serve\ndifferent functions. While a hexagram connotes a field of action, the\nsix hexagram lines stand for the six players (or the six options) in\nthat field of action (see \u201cMinggua shibian\ntongyao\u201d \u660e\u5366\u9069\u8b8a\u901a\u723b,\nLynn 1994: 29\u201331). Symbolizing the whole, a hexagram represents\na web of relations governing the actions and interactions of the six\nplayers. Symbolizing the parts, hexagram lines represent what the six\nplayers can or cannot do to advance their interests. Hence, in reading\nhexagrams, Changes readers are constantly reminded that every\naspect of human life, big or small, is governed by the part-whole\nrelationship. To cope with change, Wang Bi asserts, we must find out\nthe part-whole relationship in each given situation\u2014be it in\nfamily, society, or a solitary quest for spiritual communion with\nnature.\n\nWith the different functions of hexagrams and hexagram lines in mind,\nwe can understand why Wang Bi stresses the mutual dependency of\nsomethingness (you \u6709) and nothingness (wu\n\u65e0) in his commentary on Xici 1.8 as preserved by Han\nKangbo \u97d3\u5eb7\u4f2f (332\u2013380 CE). As discuss\nearlier, Xici 1.8 describes an elaborate process to select a\nhexagram by counting 50 yarrow stalks. Known as \u201cthe number of\nGreat Expansion\u201d (dayan zhi shu\n\u5927\u884d\u4e4b\u6578), the selection begins with the\ndiviner separating the 50 yarrow stalks into two piles: (a) a group of\n49 stalks that will be used to select a hexagram, and (b) an unused\nstalk that will be set aside in the rest of the divination procedure.\nWang Bi views the group of 49 stalks as somethingness and the unused\nstalk as nothingness. He writes:\n\n\nAfter expanding the numbers of heaven and earth, we find that the ones\nthat are of benefit to us number fifty, and of these we actually use\nforty-nine, thus leaving one unused. Although this one is not used,\nyet through it the use of the other numbers becomes readily possible,\nand although this one is not one of the numbers, yet through it the\nother numbers are formed. As this one represents the supreme ultimate\nof change, the other forty-nine constitute the ultimate of numbers.\nNothingness cannot be brought to light by means of nothingness but\nmust take place through somethingness. Therefore, by applying\nourselves constantly to this ultimate among things that have\nsomethingness, we shall surely bring to light the primogenitor from\nwhich all things derive. (Lynn 1994: 60\u201361; translation\nmodified)\n\n\nIn his comments, Wang Bi cleverly turns the discussion of divination\ninto a meditation on the co-dependence of somethingness and\nnothingness. He argues that somethingness depends on nothingness\nbecause the forty-nine yarrow stalks become useful only when they are\nutilized in casting a hexagram. Conversely, nothingness cannot fulfill\nitself without somethingness because there is no way to perform a\ndivination without the 49 yarrow stalks. Representing the practice of\ndivination, nothingness gives the purpose, the unity, and the\ncoherence to the act of throwing of the 49 yarrow stalks. Representing\nthe actual steps of casting a hexagram by throwing the yarrow stalks,\nsomethingness makes divination possible.\n\nAn analogy would be a performance of Beethoven\u2019s fifth symphony.\nAs members of the audience, we see musicians playing notes under the\nbaton of a conductor. As listeners, we hear Beethoven\u2019s music\nthat is invisible and ineffable yet transcends everything that happens\non stage. Here, the key point is the mutual dependency of the tangible\nand intangible, what we see and what we hear. Without\nBeethoven\u2019s music (a structure of notes), there would not have\nbeen a performance of the fifth symphony. Conversely, without a\nperformance by an orchestra in front of an audience, Beethoven\u2019s\nscores remain but scribbles on paper\u2014a potentiality that is\nuntapped and unrealized.\n\nOne may argue that Wang Bi\u2019s reading of the hexagrams limits the\nChanges to concrete human affairs. Unlike the Han dynasty\ncommentators, Wang had little interest in cosmology and rejected any\nattempt to match the cosmic and human realms. But in seeing the\nhexagrams as temporal-spatial grids, Wang reminds us that the\nChanges is meant to be read metaphorically. In focusing on\nthe hexagrams as pointers\u2014pointing toward something hidden,\nimplicit, yet fundamental in time and space\u2014he avoids the\npitfall of the Han dynasty commentators who turned the\nChanges into a copious system of signs to document the\nmultifarious changes in the universe. For him, the Han dynasty\ncommentators\u2019 attempt is futile because they do not accept the\nbasic tenet of the Changes\u2014the limits of human\nknowledge.\n\nIn returning to the root of the Changes as symbols, Wang Bi\ndirects readers\u2019 attention to the metaphorical significance of\nthe hexagrams. As pointers, hexagrams help readers develop a mental\npicture of their surroundings, allowing them to sort out the\nopportunities as well as the limitations in each given situation.\nHexagrams also expand readers\u2019 horizons by directing their\nattention from what is near to what is distant, from what is apparent\nto what is concealed. Above all, they give readers hope by showing the\ninfinite possibilities of changing our lives if we pay careful\nattention to our surroundings.\n\nOn this score, Wang Bi is right that the Changes is simple\nbut profound. Its symbols appear to be simple but the message they\ncarry is profound. The profundity of the Changes lies in the\nfact that the book not only offers hope and encouragement in facing\nthe challenges of life, but it also stresses human agency and activism\nin coming to terms with serendipity and uncertainty. With a critical\nassessment of our surroundings through a reading of hexagrams, we are\nempowered to turn what appears to be a failure into a blessing, or an\nimpasse into a test of character. We live because we are ready to take\ncharge of our lives. We live because we have (in Paul Tillich\u2019s\nwords) the \u201ccourage to be\u201d as part of the whole and as\noneself (Tillich 1952: 86\u2013147).\n2.3 The Divination Approach\n\nWang Bi\u2019s Changes commentary became the standard for\ninterpreting the classic throughout mid-imperial China. Its august\nstatus was confirmed by the state-approved Zhouyi zhengyi\n\u5468\u6613\u6b63\u7fa9 (The True Meanings of the Zhou\nChanges) edited by Kong Yingda \u5b54\u7a4e\u9054\n(574\u2013648). Throughout the Tang dynasty (618\u2013907) and the\nSong dynasty (960\u20131126), knowledge of Wang Bi\u2019s\nChanges commentary was tested in civil service examinations.\nIts longevity as the standard Changes commentary indicated\nconsensus among the Chinese elite that attention must be paid to\nsolving the pressing problems in the country rather than building an\neternal empire that mimicked the cosmic rhythm (Hon 2004, 2005; R.\nSmith 2008: 89\u2013139).\n\nHowever, while Wang Bi criticized the Han commentators for being\noverly ambitious in blending the natural and human realms, he was also\noverly ambitious in using human reason to discern the hidden principle\nof human affairs. Whereas Han commentators suppressed and externalized\nthe human fear of uncertainty, Wang also suppressed and externalized\nthe same fear. In viewing hexagrams as fields of action, he suppressed\nthe fear by absorbing it into part-whole relations in human affairs.\nBy turning hexagrams into pointers, he externalized the fear by\nconnecting it to a search for the principle of change in the rises and\nfalls of human life. In the end, both the Han scholars and Wang Bi\nwere hubristic in assuming they were omniscient.\n\nIn contrast, Zhu Xi \u6731\u71b9 (1130\u20131200)\u2014a key\nfigure of the Cheng-Zhu School of Neo-Confucianism of late imperial\nChina\u2014argued that the \u201coriginal meaning\u201d\n(benyi \u672c\u7fa9) of Changes was divination.\nOn the surface of it, Zhu Xi\u2019s argument seemed redundant. It had\nbeen well-known that the first two layers of the classics were oracles\noriginating from the Western Zhou period. But Zhu Xi\u2019s point was\nthat for more than a thousand years since the canonization of the\nChanges, the classic had never been read properly as a\ndivination manual. For this reason, Zhu Xi believed that the true\nmeaning of Changes lay in the imagery of the 64 hexagrams. To\ndistinguish the 64 hexagrams from the Ten Wings, Zhu Xi created two\nseparate categories in his commentary, the Zhouyi benyi\n\u5468\u6613\u672c\u7fa9 (The Original Meaning of the Zhou\nChanges). One category was the \u201cclassic\u201d\n(jing \u7d93) which covered the 64 hexagrams; the other the\n\u201ccommentarial materials\u201d (zhuan \u50b3) which\nincluded the Ten Wings. With these two categories, Zhu made clear that\nthe Ten Wings were at best supplementary materials in understanding\nthe hexagrams.\n\nUnderlying his view was a different understanding of the formation of\nthe Changes. Unlike other Changes commentators, Zhu\ndid not see the classic as an evolution from divination to philosophy.\nFor him, the sixty-four hexagrams are the foundation of the\nChanges because they are symbols of the constant changes in\nthe natural and human worlds. This pictorial depiction of\ntransformation\u2014started by Fu Xi and completed by King Wen and\nthe Duke of Zhou\u2014was later turned into a discussion of cosmology\nand morality by Confucian scholars. As a result, the Changes\nceased to be a pictorial description of the awesome and awe-inspiring\ntransformation in the universe; it became merely another text (like\nthe Book of Poetry and the Book of History in the\nConfucian canon) that taught morality to kings, nobles and government\nofficials (Hon 2008).\n\nBy privileging Fu Xi\u2019s hexagrams over Confucius\u2019s Ten\nWings, Zhu Xi wanted to achieve two goals. First, he underscored the\nimportance of divination as a method of self-cultivation. For him,\ndivination is not a superstitious act of seeking guidance from a\nsupernatural power. Rather, it is an enriching experience of\nencountering the unknown and unfathomable. In the process of\ndivination, one faces the multiple forces that shape human life, and\nthereby becomes aware of the opportunities and resources for improving\none\u2019s situation. As Joseph Adler observes, divination is\n\u201ca way of learning\u201d to Zhu Xi because it helps learners\n\u201c\u2018respond\u2019 (ying) to\n\u2018incipient\u2019 change (chi), both in external events\nand in the mind\u201d (Adler 1990: 190). Second, by focusing on the\nvisual imagery of the hexagrams, Zhu Xi saw the Changes as\nsignificantly different from other Confucian classics. Rather than\nlimiting to kings, nobles and government officials, the\nChanges appeals to a broad audience who, literate or\nilliterate, are concerned with uncertainties in life (Hon 2011).\n\nFor this reason, Zhu Xi emphasized the ambiguity of line statements.\nTo highlight their ambiguity, he divided the line statements into two\nseparate utterances: a summary of the image of the hexagram line, and\na prognostication based on a careful consideration of the image of the\nhexagram line. By dividing a line statement into two parts, Zhu Xi\nturns a line statement into a dialogue between the oracle\u2019s\ncalling to attention and the reader\u2019s response. In this\nhermeneutical circle, nothing is certain or preordained. The\nconversation can lead in many directions, sometimes predictable and\nsometimes unpredictable.\n\nOn the surface of it, like Wang Bi, Zhu Xi appears to use the\nChanges to provoke readers to reflect on their surroundings.\nHowever, there is one fundamental difference. For Zhu Xi, a reading of\nthe Changes does not necessarily answer all questions or\nsolve all problems. Rather, it heightens the reader\u2019s\nsensitivity to the uncertainty and serendipity of human existence. For\ninstance, Ge \u9769 \u4df0 (Radical Change, #49) and\nDing \u9f0e \u4df1 (The Cauldron, #50) are known for\nhighlighting the anxiety and fear in a drastic political change. In\nGe, the reader is encouraged to lead a revolt against a\ntyrant ruler who is causing harm to the public. To underscore the\nurgency of addressing the political crisis, the revolt is compared to\nthe renewal of lives in seasonal changes; it is paired with the\npivotal event of the Shang dynasty being replaced by the Zhou dynasty.\nAbove all, it is described as a timely intervention in human affairs\nto restore order for the benefit of the masses (for a translation of\nGe, see WB67: 189\u2013192). While Ge advocates a\nregime change, Ding demands the restoration of political\norder immediately following the revolt. Graphically, the six lines of\nDing \u4df1 resemble a cauldron\u2014the bottom line\nrepresents the legs of the cauldron; the second to fourth lines\nsymbolize the belly of the cauldron; the fifth line denotes the ears\nof the cauldron, and the top line suggests the bar that carries the\ncauldron from place to place. Thus, the reader is encouraged to clean\nthe cauldron to make food, or, in the aftermath of a regime change, to\nimmediately re-establish the political order (for a translation of\nDing, see WB67: 195\u201397).\n\nFor centuries, the Changes\u2019s commentators heeded the\nXugua authors\u2019 advice to read Ge and\nDing together as two phases of a regime change (see WB67:\n635, 641). While Ge discusses the destructive phase of\ntoppling an old regime, Ding refers to the constructive phase\nof rebuilding the political order. The two hexagrams jointly call\nattention to the danger of political corruption, the fear of a tyrant,\nand the anxiety of losing control amid political upheaval. More\nimportant, the two hexagrams highlight the importance of making the\nright decision amidst power struggles. For this reason, through the\ncenturies, Ge and Ding received special attention\nfrom commentators who were interested in political philosophy (see,\nfor instance, Wang Bi\u2019s commentary in Lynn 1994:\n444\u201359).\n\nFor Zhu Xi, however, there was no need to connect Ge with\nDing. Instead, he sees them as separate situations where\nreaders can ask different questions and express different concerns.\nFor him, the anxiety and fear in the Changes appear not in\nthe hexagram sequence, but in the dialogue between the oracle and the\nreader. To downplay the political connotations of these two hexagrams,\nZhu Xi stresses the intensity of the oracle-reader dialogue. Take, for\nexample, the hexagram statement of Ge which seems to suggest\nthe possibility of \u201cthe disappearance of remorse\u201d after\npolitical change. For Zhu, there is no way to tell whether \u201cthe\ndisappearance of remorse\u201d is possible without considering the\nreader\u2019s situation. If the reader is doing the right things,\nthen remorse will automatically disappear. But if the reader is making\na mistake, remorse will remain. Hence, \u201cthe disappearance of\nremorse\u201d is provisional; whether the oracle will come true rests\nin reader\u2019s motive, sincerity and action. Similarly, \u201cthe\ndisappearance of remorse\u201d in the fourth line of Ge is\nprovisional as well. Traditionally, the fourth line is read as a\nleader ready to lead a political change. For Zhu Xi, the fourth line\ndoes not look like a situation ripe for political change. Rather, he\nsees \u201cthe disappearance of remorse\u201d as a warning against\nrushing to make drastic changes (Hon 2008).\n\nLikewise, Zhu Xi does not see in Ding a roadmap to form a new\nregime. Instead, he sees each line of Ding as a separate\nsituation challenging the Changes reader. For instance, in\nthe first yin line, Zhu Xi is not worried about the\nline\u2019s peripheral position. Rather, he is interested in the\nprognostication which indicates that the line is \u201cwithout\nremorse\u201d (wujiu \u65e0\u548e). In his comments, Zhu\nXi focuses on the subtle meaning of \u201cwithout remorse\u201d and\nurges the reader to be positive about the future. He tells the reader\nthat \u201cwithout remorse\u201d is a result of the first\nline\u2019s determination to come back from behind and its will to\nsucceed despite its humble position (Hon 2008).\n\nUltimately, for Zhu Xi, all the Changes oracles are\nprovisional. Their goal is to provoke thought, command attention, and\nabove all, make readers aware of the contingency of human existence.\nBy highlighting fear and anxiety in reading hexagrams, Zhu Xi\nincorporated the Changes into his Neo-Confucian\nproject\u2014an endeavor, he hoped, that would lead to the triumph of\nthe pure and perceptive \u201cmind of the Dao\u201d (daoxin\n\u9053\u5fc3) over the perturbed and perverse \u201chuman\nmind\u201d (renxin \u4eba\u5fc3). To develop a Confucian\nmoral-metaphysics, Zhu Xi turned to the split second of decision\nmaking as a battle ground of one\u2019s moral cultivation. In that\nsplit second, Zhu Xi claimed, the human mind is deeply torn between\n\u201cthe mind of the Dao\u201d and \u201cthe human\nmind\u201d, and between \u201cthe heavenly principle\u201d\n(tianli) and \u201chuman desires\u201d (renyu)\n(Adler 2014; Tu 1985: 131\u201348). In this mental battle, the\nChanges reader is put into a moral-metaphysical journey. The\nhexagrams give the readers hope without losing sight of the immense\nchallenge of overcoming mishaps and failure. They promise success if\nreaders find the means to tame their searching minds and to counter\nthe distractions in their lives. Above all, they give spiritual depth\nto the readers\u2019 moral struggle, turning it into a battle ground\nbetween following the dictates of the flesh, or elevating oneself to\nform a \u201ctrinity with heaven and earth\u201d.\n\nIn this way, Zhu Xi opened the Changes to a wide range of\naudience. By focusing on divination and the symbolism of the 64\nhexagrams, Zhu Xi made the Changes relevant to readers who\nmight not be well educated. While it remained a canonical text, it was\ntransformed into \u201ca book of life\u201d for common people who\nstruggled daily to make the right decision between the purity of\n\u201cthe heavenly principle\u201d and the perversion of\n\u201chuman desires\u201d (Hon 2012). From the Ming dynasty\n(1368\u20131644) to the Qing dynasty (1644\u20131911), Zhu\nXi\u2019s interpretation of the Changes was promoted by the\nimperial government. It was included in the state-approved\nChanges commentaries, the Zhouyi daquan\n\u5468\u6613\u5927\u5168 (The Compendium of Cheng Yi\u2019s\nand Zhu Xi\u2019s Commentaries on the Zhou Changes) of the\nMing dynasty, and the Zhouyi zhezhong\n\u5468\u6613\u6298\u4e2d (Balanced Annotations of the Zhou\nChanges) of the Qing dynasty.\n3. Face Changes with Courage and Dignity\n\nOn the surface, these three approaches\u2014the cosmological\napproach, the rational humanistic approach, and the divination\napproach\u2014appear to steadily narrow the scope of philosophizing\nchange. They seem to continuously move away from the cosmos to the\nhuman world, and from the human world to an individual\u2019s moral\ncogitations. One may even say that in this narrowing of the scope, we\nsee a retreat from the empirical to the intellectual, and from the\nobjective to the subjective.\n\nYet, in their own ways, these three approaches offer answers to the\nhuman anxiety over uncertainty. They give hope to readers by\ntransforming the trigrams and hexagrams into symbols to discuss the\nhuman roles in the unfolding of the universe (Cheng 2003; Cheng &\nNg 2009; Redmond & Hon 2014: 140\u201357; R. Smith 2008:\n31\u201348). Together, they make three arguments:\n\nBecause the universe is an open system that is self-generative and\nself-transformative, we must live with ceaseless change;\nBecause changes take place all the time, we must find ways to\nunderstand their patterns and to navigate their complexity;\nIn every moment, we must be ready to make difficult decisions in\norder to find peace and comfort in life.\n\n\nBy emphasizing our need to make difficult decisions in the world of\nconstant changes, the authors of Changes are not suggesting\nus to be over-worried. Rather, they remind us of our limited ability\nin understanding the complexity and fluidity of our world. After\nhonestly accepting our finitude, the authors of Changes\nsuggest us to be active and aggressive in reshaping our situation.\nHere, the turnaround rests on our wisdom of knowing what we can and\ncannot do. We must remain humble and circumspective in our every step.\nBut based on what we know, we make plans to gradually improve our\nenvironment. Like a droplet, we rise and fall with the wave of the\nocean. Since both the objective reality and the subjective condition\nare perpetually shifting, the moment of finding a harmonious\nintegration between attainable and unattainable is always transient.\nWhen either the objective reality and the subjective condition\nchanges, or worse still, both of them change, the whole equilibrium is\nupset, and the process of searching for a new equilibrium has to begin\nanew. On this note, that is no better ending to the Changes\nthan hexagram Weiji \u672a\u6fdf (\u4dff Ferrying\nIncomplete, #64) because the act of balancing the competing claims and\nfinding certainty in an uncertain world are going to be continuous\nwithout end.\n\nFor us today, this philosophy of change is refreshing and energizing\nbecause it encourages us to be spontaneous, creative, and experimental\nin coping with the complexity in life. It also draws our attention to\nthe reality of the 21st century world that is dynamic,\nfluid, multi-layered, and multi-causal due to the global economy and\nthe transnational networks of circulation. More importantly, it\nreminds us that we are both a subject and an object in making\ndecisions. On the one hand, we are the products of our environment; on\nthe other hand, we are active players in reshaping our environment. In\nthe end, we are who we are\u2014constantly finding our paths in an\never-changing world. ",
