    "main_text": "Implications for Other Debates || Implications for the Philosophy of Language\n4.2 Implications for Metaphysics\n\n\nWe have seen (\u00a72) that the interest in category mistakes in the\n1930s was fueled by the thought that category mistakes reveal some\ndeep facts about ontological categories. While the project of using\ncategory mistakes to define ontological categories is no longer being\nactively pursued, category mistakes still play an important role in\nother debates in metaphysics.\n\n\nConsider the debate about the relationship between a material thing\nand its matter. A lump of clay is molded into a statue. According to\nmonists, the lump is identical to the statue. According to pluralists,\nthey are two distinct objects which occupy the same space. A key\nargument in favor of pluralism proceeds as follows:\n\n(42)\nThe statue is Romanesque.\n(43)\nThe lump is not Romanesque.\n\n\n\nTherefore,\n\n(44)\nThe statue is not identical to the lump.\n\n\n\nAn interesting feature of this argument is that (43) is, at least\narguably, a category mistake. This fact can be exploited by both\npluralist and monists in a variety of ways.\n\n\nFirst, assume that category mistakes are truth-valueless (either\nbecause they are meaningless, or because they are meaningful but\ntruth-valueless).  This poses a problem for the pluralist\u2019s\nargument because if (43) is a truth-valueless category mistake, the\n argument is unsound (one of its premises isn\u2019t\n true).[34]\n The pluralist might respond by arguing that the negation in (43)\nisn\u2019t ordinary descriptive negation but rather an instance\nof meta-linguistic negation, that is the kind of negation\nthat is present in utterances like this:\n\n(45)\nI am not happy, I am elated!\n\n\n\nWhile this might account for why (43) is a felicitous utterance it is\nnot clear that it helps the pluralist: if the negation in (43)\nisn\u2019t standard, then the premise isn\u2019t sufficient to show\nthat the statue and lump genuinely have conflicting properties, and\nare thus distinct. Almotahari (2014) pushes this line even further,\narguing that the sequence \u2018The lump is not Romanesque, but the\nstatue is\u2019 indeed involves meta-linguistic negation, but also\nthat a necessary condition on the occurrence of meta-linguistic\nnegation in such contexts is precisely that, if read with ordinary\nnegation, the first clause (\u2018I am not happy\u2019/\u2018The\nlump is not Romanesque\u2019) is semantically incompatible with the\nsecond clause (\u2018I am elated\u2019/\u2019The statue is\nRomanesque\u2019).  This conclusion, claims Almotahari, is\ndetrimental for the pluralist: in order to involve meta-linguistic\nnegation the two clauses must be (when taken literally) incompatible,\nbut they can only be incompatible if the statue is identical to the\nlump, which is precisely the monist\u2019s contention. Interestingly,\nthe claim that category mistakes are truth-valueless offers the\npluralist a rejoinder to Almotahari\u2019s argument: if we assume\nthat two statements are semantically incompatible just in case they\ncannot be simultaneously true, then the two clauses might be\nincompatible not because the statue is identical to the lump, but\nsimply because one of the two claims is a\n truth-valueless category mistake and hence in itself never\n true.[35]\n\n\nThe claim that (43) is a category mistake can play a role in this\ndebate even if one assumes that category mistakes are truth-valued but\npragmatically infelicitous. Consider a monist who accepts that the\nlump and the statue are identical and reads the negation in (43) as\nordinary descriptive negation. This would render the pluralist\u2019s\nargument to be simply unsound: if the statue is Romanesque and lump is\nidentical to it, then the lump is Romanesque as well and (43) is\nfalse.  However, there is still a burden on the monist to explain why\n(43) seems to many to be true. This is where an account of category\nmistakes might come into play. Speakers often confuse pragmatic\ninfelicity with falsity. So if \u2018The lump of clay is\nRomanesque\u2019 is pragmatically infelicitous (because it is a\ncategory mistake), speakers might mistakenly take it to be false\n(rather than true and infelicitous) and hence assume its negation\n is\n true.[36]\n\n\nFinally, irrespective of the semantic status of category mistakes,\nthe pluralist can present a somewhat different challenge to monism: if,\nas the monist claims, the statue is identical to the lump, how can the\nmonist account for the fact that \u2018The lump is Romanesque\u2019\nis a category mistake, while \u2018The statue is Romanesque\u2019 is\nnot? Whether the monist can respond to this challenge depends on the\nprecise details of one\u2019s account of category mistakes, and to\nwhat extent substituting co-referential terms preserves the relevant\nkind of infelicity.\n\n\nNext, consider a different debate at the intersection of philosophy of\nlanguage and metaphysics, one concerning the phenomenon of\ncopredication. Imagine a context where three copies of War and\nPeace are on the shelf. Each of the following seems to have a\ntrue reading:\n\n(46)\n(Exactly) three books are on the shelf.\n(47)\n(Exactly) one book is on the shelf.\n\n\n\nA natural way to account for these diverging readings is to posit\ntwo respective readings of \u2018book\u2019: one on which it is used\nto pick out physical books (of which we have three), and one on which\nit is used to pick out \u201cinformational\u201d books (of which we\nhave one). However, on further reflection this still leaves a puzzle\nconcerning (47): if \u2018book\u2019 in this sentence picks out an\ninformational book (arguably a kind of abstract entity), how can this\nkind of object have the physical property of being on the shelf? These\nkind of apparently \u2018mixed\u2019 reading are referred to in the\nliterature as instances of copredication.\n\n\nSome solutions to this puzzle involve constructing non-standard\nsemantic and syntactic structures for copredicational sentences (e.g.,\nAsher 2011; Gotham 2017), but Liebesman and Magidor (2017) argue that\nsentences such as (47) should be taken at face-value: the sentence is\nabout informational books, but on their view, informational books can\nhave physical properties such as being on shelves.\n\n\nA central challenge for this view is that it requires us to\ndistinguish between (47) and clearly infelicitous category mistakes\nsuch as:\n\n(48)\n* One prime number is on the shelf.\n\n\n\nTo sharpen the problem, consider any theory of category mistakes which\naccounts for the infelicity of (48) by maintaining that locational\nproperties such as \u2018on the shelf\u2019 are restricted so as to\nonly apply to physical objects (whether the nature of the restriction\nis syntactic, semantic, or pragmatic). This predicts that if (47) has\nthe structure Liebesman and Magidor attribute to it (namely, a\nstraightforward predication of the locational property to an\ninformational book), the sentence should have resulted in an\ninfelicitous category mistake. Liebesman and Magidor (2017,\n148\u20139) respond to this worry by arguing that the restriction\nplaced by \u2018on the shelf\u2019 is not a type restriction such as\n\u2018is a physical object\u2019, but rather a more specific\nrestriction, such as \u2018has a location\u2019 (we have seen this\nidea in \u00a73.4 in the context of the presuppositional approach,\nthough it could in principle be adopted by proponents of any of the\nsemantic accounts as well). This more specific restriction allows them\nto account for how (48) can be a category mistake even if (47) is not:\nwhile neither a number nor an informational book are physical objects,\nthe latter but not the former satisfies (so they claim) the property\nof having a location. Whether or not this account of copredication is\naccepted, we see once again how which theory of category mistakes is\nadopted has substantial implications for debates in metaphysics.\n",
