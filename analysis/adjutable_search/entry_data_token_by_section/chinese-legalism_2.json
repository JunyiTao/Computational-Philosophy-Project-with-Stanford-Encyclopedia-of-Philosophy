    "main_text": "Defining the fa Tradition || Historical Context\n1.2 Historical Context\n\nThe fa tradition is just one of the many intellectual currents that\nflourished in China during the three centuries prior to the imperial\nunification of 221 BCE. This period, often identified as the age of\nthe \u201cHundred Schools\u201d was particularly rich in terms of\npolitical thought. This outburst of interest in political issues took\nplace against the backdrop of a severe systemic crisis. The end of the\nSprings-and-Autumns period (Chunqiu \u6625\u79cb, 770\u2013453\nBCE) was marked by the progressive disintegration of political\nstructures in the Zhou \u5468 (the then Chinese) world. Gradually,\nthe realm became entangled in a web of debilitating struggles among\nrival polities, between powerful nobles and the lords within each\npolity, as well as among aristocratic lineages and among rival\nbranches within major lineages. By the fourth century BCE, a degree of\nre-centralization in individual polities was achieved, but interstate\nwarfare further intensified, giving, in retrospect, the new era an\nominous name: the age of the Warring States (Zhanguo \u6230\u570b,\n453\u2013221 BCE). As wars became bloodier and more devastating, and\nwith no adequate diplomatic means to settle the conflicts in sight,\nmost thinkers and statesmen came to an understanding that unity of\n\u201cAll-under-Heaven\u201d (tianxia \u5929\u4e0b) was\nthe only means to attain peace and stability (Pines 2000). How to\nbring this unity about and how to \u201cstabilize\nAll-under-Heaven\u201d became the central topic addressed by\ncompeting thinkers. In the final account, the fa\ntradition\u2019s ability to provide the most compelling answers to\nthis question became the singular source of its ideological\nappeal.\n\nCrises and bloodshed aside, the Warring States period was also an age\nrife with opportunities for intellectually active individuals. It was\nan exceptionally dynamic period, marked by novel departures and\nprofound changes in all walks of life. Politically, the loose\naristocratic entities of the Springs-and-Autumns period were replaced\nby centralized and bureaucratized territorial states (Lewis 1999).\nEconomically, the introduction of iron utensils (Wagner 1993)\nrevolutionized agriculture, allowing higher yields, prompting the\ndevelopment of wastelands, and bringing about demographic growth, as\nwell as accelerating urbanization and commercialization of the\neconomy. Militarily, new technologies, such as the crossbow, as well\nas new forms of military organization, brought about the replacement\nof aristocratic chariot-led armies by mass infantry armies staffed by\npeasant conscripts, resulting in a radical increase in warfare\u2019s\nscale and complexity (Lewis 1999). And socially, the hereditary\naristocracy that dominated the Zhou world during most of the Bronze\nAge (ca. 1500\u2013400 BCE) was eclipsed by a much broader stratum of\nshi \u58eb (sometimes translated as \u201cmen of\nservice\u201d), who owed their position primarily to their abilities\nrather than the pedigree (Pines 2009: 115\u2013135). These profound\nchanges required new approaches to a variety of administrative,\neconomic, military, social, and ethical issues: old truths had to be\nreconsidered or reinterpreted. For intellectuals eager to tackle a\nvariety of new questions\u2014and particularly for fa\nthinkers\u2014this was a golden age.\n\nEach of the competing \u201cschools of thought\u201d sought ways to\nimprove the functioning of the state, to attain sociopolitical\nstability, and to bring about peace under Heaven; yet among a variety\nof answers those provided by the fa thinkers appear to be most\npractical. This is not incidental: after all, some of the major\nfa thinkers, most notably Shang Yang, were the leading\nreformers of their age. These thinkers were at the forefront of\nadministrative and sociopolitical innovation; they were most ready to\ndispense with bygone norms and paradigms; and they were more pragmatic\nand result-oriented than most of their ideological rivals. Their\nrecipes proved to be highly effective in the age of fierce interstate\ncompetition, but once the imperial unification was attained and the\nneed in full mobilization of human and economic resources receded, the\nappeal of the fa ideas weakened as well (section 7 below). By\nthen, the lingering resentment against the fa thinkers\u2019\ncynicism and their perceived anti-intellectualism resulted in the\nincreasing denigration of the fa tradition in general (Song,\nforthcoming B). In retrospect, Sima Tan\u2019s observation appears to\nbe correct: the fa recipes were highly effective in the short\nrun but less attractive in the long term.\n",
