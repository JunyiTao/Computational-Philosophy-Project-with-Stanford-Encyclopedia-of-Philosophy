    "main_text": "The Physics of Mass-Energy Equivalence || Mass and Energy in Atomic Physics\n1.4 Mass and Energy in Atomic Physics\n\nPerhaps the most common examples used to illustrate Einstein\u2019s\nequation concern collisions among sub-atomic objects. For our\npurposes, it is safe to treat atomic and sub-atomic objects as\nparticles involved in collisions where the total number of particles\nmay or may not be conserved.\n\nThe bombardment of a Lithium nucleus by protons is a historically\nsignificant and useful example for discussing mass-energy equivalence\nin collisions where the number of particles is conserved. Cockcroft\nand Walton (1932) were the first to observe the release of two\n\\(\\alpha\\)-particles when a proton \\(p\\) collides with a \\({^7}\\Li\\)\nnucleus. The reaction is symbolized as follows:\n\n \n\\[\np + {^7}\\Li \\rightarrow \\alpha + \\alpha\n\\]\n\n\nThat the number of particles is conserved in this reaction becomes\nclear when we recognize that the \\({^7}\\Li\\) nucleus consists of three\nprotons and four neutrons and that each \\(\\alpha\\)-particle consists\nof two protons and two neutrons.\n\nIn the bombardment of Lithium reaction above, the sum of the\nrest-masses of the reactants (the proton and the \\({^7}\\Li\\) nucleus) is\ngreater than the sum of the rest-masses of the products (the\ntwo \\(\\alpha\\)-particles). However, the total kinetic energy of the\nreactants is less than the total kinetic energy of the\nproducts. Cockcroft and Walton\u2019s experiment is routinely\ninterpreted as demonstrating that the difference in the rest-masses of\nthe products and reactants (times \\(c^2)\\) is equal to the difference\nin the kinetic energies of the products and reactants (but see\n Section 4\n for further discussion of this experiment as a confirmation of\nmass-energy equivalence).\n\nDescriptions of collisions among sub-atomic particles such as the\nbombardment of Lithium make it seem as though one must admit that mass\nis converted into energy. However, influenced perhaps by the\nwidely-known discussion of mass-energy equivalence by Bondi and\nSpurgin (1987) (see\n Section 2.3.1),\n physicists now explain such reactions not as cases of mass being\nconverted into energy, but merely as cases where energy has changed\nforms. Typically, in these types of reactions, the potential energy\nthat \u201ccontributes\u201d to the rest-mass of one (or possibly)\nmore of the reactants is transformed in a non-controversial\nway to the kinetic energy of the products. As Baierlein (2007, p. 322)\nexplains, in the case of the bombardment of \\({^7}\\Li\\) with protons and\nits subsequent decomposition into two \\(\\alpha\\)-particles, the\napparently \u201cexcess\u201d kinetic energy of the\n\\(\\alpha\\)-particles did not simply \u201cappear\u201d out of\nnowhere. Instead, that energy was there all along as the potential and\nkinetic energy of the nucleons. In other words, one can explain the\nchange in mass and energy in the bombardment reaction by saying (i)\nthat the potential and kinetic energies of the nucleons that make up\nthe \\({^7}\\Li\\) nucleus contribute to its rest-mass and (ii) that the\nvast amount of energy of the \\(\\alpha\\)-particles was not\n\u201ccreated\u201d in the reaction, or \u201cconverted\u201d from\nmass, but was simply transformed from the various forms of energy the\nnucleons possess.\n\nCollisions among sub-atomic particles and their corresponding\nanti-particle are not quite so easily explained as merely involving\nthe re-arrangement of particles and re-distribution of energy. The\nmost extreme example of this sort, and one that is often used in the\nphysics literature, is pair annihilation. Consequently, let us\nconsider a collision between an electron \\(e^-\\) and a positron\n\\(e^+\\), which yields two photons \\(\\gamma\\). Symbolically, this\nannihilation reaction is written as follows:\n\n \n\\[\ne^- + e^+ \\rightarrow \\gamma + \\gamma\n\\]\n\n\nAccording to the currently accepted Standard Model of particle\nphysics, electrons and photons are both \u201cfundamental\nparticles,\u201d by which physicists mean that such particles have no\nstructure, i.e., such particles are not composed of other, smaller\nparticles. Furthermore, the photons that are the products in the\nannihilation reaction have zero rest-mass. Thus, the rest-masses of\nthe incoming electron and positron seems to \u201cdisappear\u201d\nand an equivalent amount of energy \u201cappears\u201d as the energy\nof the outgoing photons. Of course, Einstein\u2019s famous equation\nmakes all of the correct predictions concerning the relevant masses\nand energies involved in this reaction. So, for example, the total\nenergy of the two photons is equal to the sum of the kinetic energies\nof the electron and positron plus the sum of the rest-masses\nof the electron and positron multiplied by \\(c^2\\).\n\nFinally, although mass and energy seem to \u201cdisappear\u201d and\n\u201cappear\u201d respectively when we focus on the individual\nconstituents of the physical system containing the incoming\nelectron-positron pair and the outgoing photons, the mass and\nenergy of the entire system remains the same throughout the\ninteraction. Before the collision, the rest-mass of the system is\nsimply the sum of the rest-masses of the electron and positron plus\nthe mass-equivalent of the total kinetic energy of the particles.\nConsequently, the entire system (if we draw the boundary of the system\naround the reactants and products\u2014which is, of course, a spatial\nand temporal boundary), has a non-zero rest-mass prior to the\ncollision. However, after the collision, the system, which now\nconsists of two photons moving in non-parallel directions, also has a\nnon-zero rest-mass (for a detailed discussion concerning the rest-mass\nof systems of photons, see Taylor and Wheeler, 1992, p.\u00a0232).\n\n",
