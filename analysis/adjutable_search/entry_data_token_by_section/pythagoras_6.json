    "main_text": "The Philosophy of Pythagoras\n4. The Philosophy of Pythagoras\n\n\nOne of the manifestations of the attempt to glorify Pythagoras in the\nlater tradition is the report that he, in fact, invented the word\nphilosophy. This story goes back to the early Academy, since it is\nfirst found in Heraclides of Pontus (Cicero, Tusc. V 3.8;\nDiogenes Laertius, Proem). The historical accuracy of the\nstory is called into question by its appearance not in a historical or\nbiographical text but rather in a dialogue that recounted Empedocles\u2019\nrevival of a woman who had stopped breathing. Moreover, the story\ndepends on a conception of a philosopher as having no knowledge but\nbeing situated between ignorance and knowledge and striving for\nknowledge. Such a conception is thoroughly Platonic, however (see,\ne.g., Symposium 204A), and Burkert demonstrated that it could\nnot belong to the historical Pythagoras (1960). For a recent attempt\nto defend at least the partial accuracy of the story, see Riedweg\n2005: 90\u201397 and the response by Huffman 2008a:207\u2013208; see\nalso Zhmud 2012a, 428\u2013430.\n\n\nEven if he did not invent the word, what can we say about the\nphilosophy of Pythagoras? For the reasons given in 1. The Pythagorean\nQuestion and 2. Sources above, any responsible account of Pythagoras\u2019\nphilosophy must be based in the first place on the evidence prior to\nAristotle and in the second place on evidence that our sources\nexplicitly identify as deriving from Aristotle\u2019s books on the\nPythagoreans as well as from the books of his pupils such as\nAristoxenus and Dicaearchus. There is general agreement as to what the\npre-Aristotelian evidence is, although there are differences in\ninterpretation of it. There is less agreement as to what should be\nincluded in Aristotle\u2019s, Dicaearchus\u2019 and Aristoxenus\u2019 evidence. What\none includes as evidence from these authors will have a significant\neffect on one\u2019s picture of Pythagoras. One particularly pressing\nquestion is whether both chapters 18 and 19 of Porphyry\u2019s Life of\nPythagoras should be regarded as deriving from Dicaearchus, as\nthe most recent editor proposes (Mirhady Fr. 40), or whether only\nchapter 18 should be included, as in the earlier edition of Wehrli\n(Fr.33). It is crucial to decide this question before developing a\npicture of the philosophy of Pythagoras since chapter 19, if it is by\nDicaearchus, is our earliest summary of Pythagorean\nphilosophy. Porphyry is very reliable about quoting his sources. He\nexplicitly cites Dicaearchus at the beginning of Chapter 18 and names\nNicomachus as his source at the beginning of chapter 20. The material\nin chapter 19 follows seamlessly on chapter 18: the description of the\nspeeches that Pythagoras gave upon his arrival in Croton in chapter 18\nis followed in chapter 19 by an account of the disciples that he\ngained as the result of those speeches and a discussion of what he\ntaught these disciples. Thus, the onus is on anyone who would claim\nthat Porphyry changes sources before the explicit change at the\nbeginning of chapter 20. Chapter 19 provides a very restrained account\nof what can be reliably known about Pythagoras\u2019 teachings and that\nvery restraint is one of the strongest supporting arguments for its\nbeing based on Dicaearchus, since Porphyry or anyone else in the\nluxuriant later tradition would be expected to give a much more\nexpanisve presentation of Pythagoras in accordance with the\nNeopythagorean view of him (Burkert 1972a, 122\u2013123). Wehrli gives no\nreason for not including chapter 19 and the great majority of scholars\naccept it as being based on Dicaearchus (see the references in Burkert\n1972a, 122, n.7). Zhmud (2012a, 157) following Philip (1966, 139)\nargues that the passage cannot derive from Dicaearchus, since it\npresents immortality of the soul with approval, whereas Dicaearchus\ndid not accept its immortality. However, the passage merely reports\nthat Pythagoras introduced the notion of the immortality of the soul\nwithout expressing approval or disapproval. Zhmud lists other features\nof the chapter that he regards as unparalleled in fourth-century\nsources (2012a, 157) but, since the evidence is so fragmentary, such\narguments from silence can carry little weight. Nothing in the chapter\nis demonstrably late or inconsistent with Dicaearchus\u2019 authorship so\nwe must follow what is suggested by the context in Porphyry and regard\nit as derived from Dicaearchus.\n\n\nIn the face of the Pythagorean question and the problems that arise\neven regarding the early sources, it is reasonable to wonder if we can\nsay anything about Pythagoras. A minimalist might argue that the early\nevidence only allows us to conclude that Pythagoras was a historical\nfigure who achieved fame for his wisdom but that it is impossible to\ndetermine in what that wisdom consisted. We might say that he was\ninterested in the fate of the soul and taught a way of life, but we\ncan say nothing precise about the nature of that life or what he\ntaught about the soul (Lloyd 2014). There is some reason to believe,\nhowever, that something more than this can be said.\n",
