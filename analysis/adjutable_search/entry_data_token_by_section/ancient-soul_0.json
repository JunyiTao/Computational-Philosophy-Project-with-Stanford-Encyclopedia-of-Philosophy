    "main_text": "The Greek Notion of Soul\n1. The Greek Notion of Soul\n\n The Homeric poems, with which most ancient writers can safely be\nassumed to be intimately familiar, use the word \u2018soul\u2019 in\ntwo distinguishable, probably related, ways. The soul is, on the one\nhand, something that a human being risks in battle and loses in\ndeath. On the other hand, it is what at the time of death departs from\nthe person's limbs and travels to the underworld, where it has a more\nor less pitiful afterlife as a shade or image of the deceased\nperson. It has been suggested (for instance, by Snell 1975, 19) that\nwhat is referred to as soul in either case is in fact thought of as\none and the same thing, something that a person can risk and lose and\nthat, after death, endures as a shade in the underworld. The\nsuggestion is plausible, but cannot be verified. In any case, once a\nperson's soul has departed for good, the person is dead. The presence\nof soul therefore distinguishes a living human body from a\ncorpse. However, this is plainly not to say that the soul is thought\nof as what accounts for, or is responsible for, the activities,\nresponses, operations and the like that constitute a person's\nlife. Homer never says that anyone does anything in virtue of, or\nwith, their soul, nor does he attribute any activity to the soul of a\nliving person. Thus, though the presence or absence of soul marks out\na person's life, it is not otherwise associated with that\nlife. Moreover, it is a striking feature of Homeric usage that, in\nFurley's words (Furley 1956, 4), to mention soul is to suggest death:\nsomeone's soul comes to mind only when their life is thought, by\nthemselves or others, to be at risk. Thus Achilles says that he is\ncontinuously risking his soul (Iliad 9.322), and Agenor\nreflects on the fact that even Achilles has just one soul\n(Iliad 11.569). It should also be pointed out that in the\nHomeric poems, only human beings are said to have (and to lose) souls.\nCorrespondingly, Homer never envisages shades or images of non-human\ncreatures in the underworld. These two facts taken together suggest\nthat in whatever precise way the soul is conceived of as associated\nwith life, it is in any case thought to be connected not with life in\ngeneral, or life in all its forms, but rather, more specifically, with\nthe life of a human being.\n \n Several significant developments occurred in the ways Greeks thought\nand spoke about the soul in the sixth and fifth centuries. The\nquestions about the soul that are formulated and discussed in the\nwritings of Plato and Aristotle to some extent arise from, and need to\nbe interpreted against the background of, these sixth and fifth\ncentury developments.  One factor that is of central importance is the\ngradual loss of the Homeric connection between mentioning a person's\nsoul and the thought that their life is vulnerable or at risk\n(contra Burnet 1916, 253). In ordinary fifth century Greek,\nhaving soul is simply being alive; hence the emergence, at about this\ntime, of the adjective \u2018ensouled\u2019 [empsuchos] as\nthe standard word meaning \u201calive\u201d, which was applied not\njust to human beings, but to other living things as well.  There is\nsome reason to think that the word \u2018soul\u2019 was used in this\nstraightforwardly positive way already in the sixth century. Thales of\nMiletus, who is credited with successfully predicting a solar eclipse\noccurring in 585, reportedly attributed soul to magnets, on the\ngrounds that magnets are capable of moving iron (Aristotle, De\nAnima 1.2, 405a19-21). Thales' thought was presumably that since\nit is distinctive of living things to be able to initiate movement,\nmagnets must in fact be alive or, in other words, ensouled. Thus,\nwhile Homer spoke of soul only in the case of human beings, in sixth\nand fifth century usage soul is attributed to every kind of living\nthing. What is in place, then, at this time is the notion that soul is\nwhat distinguishes that which is alive from that which is not. \n\n However, it is not just that soul is said to be present in every\nliving thing. It is also the case that an increasingly broad range of\nways of acting and being acted on is attributed to the soul. Thus it\nhas come to be natural, by the end of the fifth century, to refer\npleasure taken in food and drink, as well as sexual desire, to the\nsoul. (For detailed discussion, see Claus 1981, 73-85.) People are\nsaid, for example, to satisfy their souls with rich food (Euripides,\nIon 1170), and the souls of gods and men are claimed to be\nsubject to sexual desire (fragment assigned by Nauck to Euripides'\nfirst Hippolytus). In contexts of intense emotion or crisis,\nfeelings like love and hate, joy and grief, anger and shame are\nassociated with the soul. \u201cNothing bites the soul of a man more\nthan dishonor\u201d, says Ajax in a fragment from a tragedy of\nunknown authorship, just before he commits suicide (Nauck, TGF,\nAdesp. fr. 110).  Oedipus says that his soul laments the misery of\nhis city and its inhabitants (Oedipus Tyrannus 64). Moreover,\nthe soul is also importantly connected with boldness and courage,\nespecially in battle.  Courageous people are said, for instance in\nHerodotus and Thucydides, to have enduring or strong souls\n(cf. Laches' second definition of the virtue that is courage, in\nPlato's Laches 192c, as \u201cstrength of the soul\u201d;\nalso relevant is Pindar, Pythian 1.47-8, \u201cstanding in\nbattle with an enduring soul\u201d).  In the Hippocratic text\nAirs, Waters, Places, the soul is thought of as the place of\ncourage or, as the case may be, its opposite: in the case of lowland\ninhabitants, courage and endurance are not in their souls by nature,\nbut must be instilled by law (ch. 23); similarly in benign climates,\nmen are fleshy, ill-jointed, moist, without endurance and weak in soul\n(ch. 24). \n\n The connection between the soul and characteristics like boldness and\ncourage in battle is plainly an aspect of the noteworthy fifth century\ndevelopment whereby the soul comes to be thought of as the source or\nbearer of moral qualities such as, for instance, temperance and\njustice. In Pericles' funeral oration that Thucydides includes in his\naccount of the Peloponnesian War, he says that those who know most\nclearly the sweet and the terrible, and yet do not as a result turn\naway from danger, are rightly judged \u201cstrongest with regard to\nsoul\u201d (2.40.3). This text, and others like it (cf.  also\nHerodotus 7.153), indicate a semantic extension whereby\n\u2018soul\u2019 comes to denote a person's moral character, often,\nbut not always, with special regard to qualities such as endurance and\ncourage. While the connection with courage is obvious in a number of\ntexts, there are other texts in which the soul is the bearer of other\nadmirable qualities, such as a Euripidean fragment that speaks of the\ndesire characteristic of a soul that is just, temperate and good (fr.\n388). Hippolytus, in Euripides' play named after him, describes\nhimself as having a \u201cvirgin soul\u201d (Hippolytus\n1006), obviously to evoke his abstinence from sex. In Pindar's second\nOlympian, salvation is promised to those who \u201ckeep their souls\nfrom unjust acts\u201d (2.68-70). The last two texts mentioned may\nwell be influenced by Orphic and Pythagorean beliefs about the nature\nand immortality of the soul, to which we will turn in due course. But\nit would be a mistake to think that the moralization of the soul\n(i.e. its association with moral characteristics) wholly depended on\nOrphic and Pythagorean speculation. It would, at the very least, be to\ndisregard the soul's connection with courage in poetry, the historians\nand in Hippocratic writings.\n\n To educated fifth century speakers of Greek, it would have been\nnatural to think of qualities of soul as accounting for, and being\nmanifested in, a person's morally significant behavior. Pericles acts\ncourageously, and Hippolytus temperately (or chastely), because of the\nqualities of their souls from which such actions have a strong\ntendency to flow, and their actions express and make evident the\ncourage, temperance and the like that characterize their souls. Once\nwe are in a position properly to appreciate the connection between\nsoul and moral character that must already have been felt to be\nnatural at this stage, it should come as no surprise that the soul is\nalso taken to be something that engages in activities like thinking\nand planning. If the soul is, in some sense, responsible for\ncourageous acts, for instance, it is only to be expected that the soul\nalso grasps what, in the circumstances, courage calls for, and how, at\nsome suitable level of detail, the courageous act must be\nperformed. Thus in a speech of Antiphon, the jury is urged to\n\u201ctake away from the accused the soul that planned the\ncrime\u201d, in striking juxtaposition of the ideas of life-soul (as\nin Homer) and of soul as responsible for practical thought. Somewhat\nsimilarly, in a Sophoclean fragment (fr. 97) someone says that\n\u201ca kindly soul with just thoughts is a better inventor than any\nsophist\u201d (cf. also Euripides, Orestes 1180). Moreover, it\nis easy to see that there are connections between familiar uses of\n\u2018soul\u2019 in emotional contexts and attributions to the soul\nof cognitive and intellectual activities and achievements. There is,\nafter all, no clear-cut and manifest difference between, say, being in\nthe emotional state of fear and having a terrifying thought or\nperception. When Oedipus' soul laments, or Ajax's soul is bitten by\ndishonor, emotion obviously goes hand in hand with cognition, and if\nit is natural to refer the one to the soul, there should be nothing\npuzzling about attributions to it of the other. Thus in\nnon-philosophical Greek of the fifth century the soul is treated as\nthe bearer of moral qualities, and also as responsible for practical\nthought and cognition.  For further discussion, see this supplement\non the contrary claims of Burnet 1916: \n\nBurnet on the Greek Notion of Soul\n\n\n From Homer to the end of the fifth century, the word\n\u2018soul\u2019 undergoes remarkable semantic expansion, in the\ncourse of which it comes to be natural not only to speak of soul as\nwhat distinguishes the living from the dead and (not the same\ndistinction) the animate from the inanimate, but also to attribute to\nthe soul a wide variety of activities and responses, cognitive as well\nas emotional, and to think of it as the bearer of such virtues as\ncourage, temperance and justice. As a result of these developments,\nthe language made available something that Homeric Greek lacked, a\ndistinction between body and soul. Thus the Hippocratic author of\nAirs, Waters, Places writes of \u201cendurance in body and\nsoul\u201d (ch. 23).  Antiphon says of a defendant who is sure of his\ninnocence that though his body may surrender, his soul saves him by\nits willingness to struggle, through knowledge of its innocence. For\nthe guilty, on the other hand, even a strong body is to no avail,\nsince his soul fails him, \u201cbelieving the vengeance coming to him\nis for his impieties\u201d (Antiphon 5). Homer, by contrast, knows\nand speaks of a whole lot of different sources and bearers of\npsychological predicates, but lacks a word to pick out the soul as a\nsingle item to which the predicates in question can, in some way or\nother, be referred and which can be distinguished from, and in\nsuitable contexts contrasted with, the body (cf. Snell 1975,\n18-25). \n",
