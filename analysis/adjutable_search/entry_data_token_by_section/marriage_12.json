    "main_text": "Marriage and Oppression: Gender, Race, and Class || Feminist Approaches\n5.2 The Queer Critique\n\nJust as some feminists argue that marriage is inherently sexist, so\nsome philosophers of gay, lesbian, bisexual, and transgender\noppression argue that it is essentially heterosexist. (Some of these\nphilosophers refer to themselves as queer theorists, reclaiming the\nword \u201cqueer\u201d from its earlier, pejorative usage.) Queer\ntheorists have sought to demonstrate that a wide range of social\ninstitutions display heteronormativity, that is, the assumption of\nheterosexuality and of the gender difference that defines it as a\nnorm. Because queer theorists resist the normativity of gender as well\nas of heterosexuality, there is an overlap between their critiques of\nmarriage and those of some feminists, especially lesbian feminists.\nFor these critics of heteronormativity, same-sex marriage is\nundesirable because it would assimilate same-sex relationships to an\nessentially heterosexual marital ideal: \u201cQueer theorists worry\nthat pursuing marriage rights is assimilationist, because it rests on\nthe view that it would be better for gay and lesbian relationships to\nbe as much like traditional heterosexual intimate relationships as\npossible\u201d (Calhoun 2000, 113). On this view, extending marriage\nto same-sex marriage will undermine, rather than achieve, gay and\nlesbian liberation - and, indeed, further marginalize asexuals,\naromantics, polyamorists, and those who choose to build their lives\naround friendships.\n\nRecall that some arguments for same-sex marriage claim that central,\nexclusive relationships are valuable, and that same-sex marriage would\nbenefit gays and lesbians by encouraging them to enter such\nrelationships (e.g. Macedo 2005; see 3.3). But critics of\nheteronormativity, drawing on gay and lesbian experience, have argued\nthat the central, exclusive relationship ideal is a heterosexual\nparadigm. Such critics note that gays and lesbians often choose\nrelationships which are less possessive and more flexible than\nmonogamous marriage. Instead of recognizing the diverse relationships\nfound in the gay and lesbian community, same-sex marriage would\nassimilate lesbian and gay relationships into the heterosexual model.\nWhile some advocates of same-sex marriage argue that marital status\nwould confer legitimacy on same-sex relationships, these critics argue\nthat the state should not confer legitimacy (and hence, implicitly,\nillegitimacy) on consensual adult relationships, any more than it\nshould so discriminate between children born in or out of wedlock.\nSuch conferrals of legitimacy are thought to discourage diversity.\nMoreover, same-sex marriage would expose gays and lesbians to the\ndisadvantages, even evils, of marriage: economic incentives to stay in\nloveless marriages and reduced exit options which facilitate abuse and\nviolence (Card 1996, 2007, Ettelbrick 1989).\n\nOther philosophers of gay and lesbian oppression have responded in\ndefense of same-sex marriage that it not only serves gay liberation,\nit is essential to it. Excluding gays and lesbians from marriage marks\nthem as inferior, and so same-sex marriage would decrease stigmas\nagainst homosexuality. Further, the costs of same-sex marriage must be\nweighed with benefits such as healthcare, custody and inheritance\nrights, and tax and immigration status (Calhoun 2000, Chapter 5,\nFerguson 2007, Mayo and Gunderson 2000). Finally, in response to\nworries about gay and lesbian assimilation, defenders of same-sex\nmarriage have argued that marriage can incorporate diversity, rather\nthan suppressing it. Marriage need not entail monogamy; indeed, it is\nargued that same-sex marriage could perform the liberatory function of\nteaching heterosexuals that neither gender roles nor monogamy are\nessential to love and marriage (Mohr 2005, 69\u20139, cf. Halwani\n2003, Chapter 3; but see Brake 2018 for discussion of whether\n\u201csubversive weddings\u201d can transform social attitudes if\nthey are not recognized as initiating marriages).\n\nThe feminist and queer critiques of marriage as essentially sexist, or\nessentially heterosexist, face the same objection as do other claims\nabout the essence of marriage. Just because marriage has in the past\npossessed certain features does not entail that they are inherent to\nit. Thus, rather than reproducing sexist and heterosexist patterns,\nsame-sex marriage could serve women\u2019s and gay liberation by\ntransforming marriage, even, perhaps, opening the door to recognition\nof a still wider variety of family forms (Ferguson 2007, Mayo and\nGunderson 2000, Calhoun 2005, Brake 2012).\n",
