    "main_text": "\n\nEconomic analysis of law applies the tools of microeconomic theory to\nthe analysis of legal rules and institutions. Ronald Coase [1960] and\nGuido Calabresi [1961] are generally identified as the seminal\narticles but Commons [1924] and Hale [1952] among others had brought\neconomic thinking to the study of law in the 1910s and 1920s.\n\nRichard Posner [1973] brought economic analysis of law to the\nattention of the general legal academy; by the late 1970s, his work\nhad provoked a vigorous controversy. This controversy was both general\nand doctrinally specific. Posner had claimed generally that the common\nlaw was and ought to be efficient. This latter claim provoked a broad\ncontroversy about the evaluation of legal rules.\n\nMore specifically, controversy recurred each time economic analysts of\nlaw addressed another doctrinal area. More often than not, the\nintroduction of economic analysis into the study of a doctrine\ntransformed that area of scholarship. For a time, economic analysis\ndominated the study of private law in the United States; arguably it\nstill dominates, though a healthy resurgence of moral accounts of\nthese areas has recently emerged to challenge economic analysis of\nprivate law.\n\nMany practitioners and critics alike believe that economic analysis of\nlaw offers a comprehensive theory of law. As traditionally understood,\na comprehensive theory of law has several components. First, a\ncomprehensive theory of law begins with a characterization of the\nnature of law. This component distinguishes law not only from other\nnormative systems such as morality, religion, and social conventions\nsuch as etiquette but also from coercion and politics.\n\nThe second part of a comprehensive theory of law characterizes the\ngrounds of law. Dworkin framed the grounds of law as the truth\nconditions for a proposition of law. From this perspective, much of\nthe debate over the concept of law concerns the role that morality\nplays in these truth conditions. As discussed in section 3 below, the\nfirst and second parts of a comprehensive theory of law have often\nbeen conflated in the debate over the concept of law.\n\nThe third part of a a comprehensive theory of law identifies the\nnature of the reasons for action that law provides. Often, this aspect\nof a theory of law is subsumed under the second part that identifies\nthe grounds of law. For purposes of an exposition of the economic\ntheory of law, however, it is useful to distinguish these two\nquestions.\n\nThe fourth part of a comprehensive theory of law identifies the value\nof legality. The fifth and final part of a comprehensive theory of law\narticulates a normative theory of adjudication, a theory of how judges\nought to decide cases.\n\nFramed this way, it is not clear that economic analysis of law does\nprovide a comprehensive theory of law. The questions posed above have\nrarely been addressed clearly and explicitly by economic analysts of\nlaw. The early debates conflated theories of adjudication with the\nvalue of legality; subsequent debates have largely concerned theories\nof private law rather than of law generally. This essay thus offers\nboth an interpretation of the approach to these five questions\nimplicit in the practice of economic analysis of law and a\nrecharacterization of economic analysis of law generally. \n\nEconomic analysis of law is not a single, unitary practice but a set\nof projects that share a methodological approach. The typical economic\nanalysis of law does not set its task within the framework of a\ngeneral legal theory. Rather, it addresses a specific question about\nthe causes or consequences or social value of a specific legal rule or\nset of legal rules. Phrased differently, the typical economic analysis\nof law investigates a specific legal rule or institution rather than\nmake general claims about the nature of law. \n\nNonetheless, economic analysis of law, or at least strands of it,\nimplicitly offer distinctive, often radical, answers to the questions\naddressed by legal theory. Moreover, some strands suggest a radically\ndifferent perspective on law and legal theory. The next section sets\nout the complex set of claims that emerge from the mass of economic\nanalyses of law and identifies three projects that organize much of\nthe work in the field. Subsequent sections ask what perspective on law\nthese claims and projects implicitly or explicitly provide.\n",
