    "main_text": "Contemporary Theories of Political Obligation || Consent\n4.1 Consent\n\nMost people who believe that they have an obligation to obey the law\nprobably think that this putative obligation is grounded in their\nconsent. Political philosophers are less inclined to think this way,\nhowever, in light of the withering criticism to which Hume and more\nrecent writers \u2013 notably Simmons (1979, chaps. 3 and 4) \u2013\nhave subjected consent theory. The critics\u2019 claim is not that\nconsent cannot be a source of obligations, for they typically believe\nthat it can. Their claim, instead, is that too few people have either\nexpressly or tacitly given the kind of actual consent that can ground\na general obligation to obey the law, and hypothetical consent cannot\nsupply the defect, for reasons already noted.\n\nNevertheless, consent theory still has its adherents among political\nphilosophers. Their versions of consent theory vary considerably,\nthough, with two main branches emerging in response to the criticisms.\nOne response, advanced by Harry Beran (1987), accepts the claim that\nonly express consent can generate a political obligation, but then\ncalls for political societies to establish formal procedures for\nevoking such consent. That is, states should require their members\nopenly to undertake an obligation to obey the law or to refuse to do\nso. Those who decline the obligation will then have the options of\nleaving the state, seceding to form a new state with like-minded\npeople, or taking residence in a territory within the state reserved\nfor dissenters. In the absence of such procedures, it seems that\nBeran\u2019s position is roughly the same as that of the a posteriori\nphilosophical anarchist. Were the procedures he recommends in place,\nthough, it is far from clear that the options available to the members\nwill make their \u201cconsent\u201d truly voluntary (Klosko 2005,\npp. 123\u201329; Horton, pp. 34\u201336).\n\nThe second line of response to the criticisms of consent theory is to\nargue in one way or another that the critics construe\n\u201cconsent\u201d too narrowly. Thus John Plamenatz (1968,\n\u201cPostscript\u201d) and Peter Steinberger (2004, p. 218) have\nmaintained that voting or otherwise participating in elections should\ncount as consent; and Steinberger produces a lengthy list of fairly\nordinary activities \u2013 calling the police or fire department for\nhelp, sending children to a public school, using a public library, and\nmore \u2013 that constitute \u201cactive participation in the\ninstitutions of the state\u201d (pp. 219\u201320). Mark Murphy and\nMargaret Gilbert have sounded variations on this theme by arguing, in\nMurphy\u2019s case, that \u201csurrender of judgment is a kind of\nconsent\u201d (in Edmundson 1999, p. 320), or, in Gilbert\u2019s,\nthat \u201cjoint commitment\u201d is an important source of\nobligations, including political obligations (1993, 2006, 2013). For\nMurphy, surrender of judgment is consent in the usual sense of\nvoluntary agreement or acceptance. As he says, \u201cOne consents to\nanother in a certain sphere of conduct in the acceptance sense of\nconsent when one allows the other\u2019s practical judgments to take\nthe place of his or her own with regard to that sphere of conduct.\n(This consent may be either to a person or to a set of rules: both of\nthese can be authoritative)\u201d (p. 330). As the earlier discussion\nof her ideas indicates (\u00a72.3), Gilbert differs from Murphy, and\nothers, in taking a joint commitment to be something that need not\narise voluntarily. According to her theory, \u201can understanding of\njoint commitment and a readiness to be jointly committed are necessary\nif one is to accrue political obligations, as is common knowledge of\nthese in the population in question. One can, however, fulfill these\nconditions without prior deliberation or decision, and if one has\ndeliberated, one may have had little choice but to incur them\u201d\n(2006, p. 290). Indeed, membership in a \u201cplural subject\u201d\nformed through non-voluntary joint commitments plays such a large part\nin Gilbert\u2019s theory that it may be better to place her with\nthose who advocate an \u201cassociative\u201d or\n\u201cmembership\u201d theory of political obligation than with\nadherents of consent theory.\n\nDavid Estlund (2008, pp. 117\u201358) has recently offered a new\ntwist on consent theory. Most theorists maintain that putative acts of\nconsent are void if it would be wrong to consent to another\u2019s\nauthority. For example, consent to be another\u2019s slave generates\nno obligation even if it genuinely expresses a person\u2019s will.\nEstlund argues on grounds of symmetry that we ought to draw the same\nconclusion in cases where it would be wrong not to consent to\nanother\u2019s authority. Such failures are void, and so a person who\nmorally ought to have consented to another\u2019s authority has a\nduty to obey her. If subjects of a given state ought to consent to\nobey its laws, say because the state performs morally necessary tasks,\nthen their failure to do so is void and no barrier to concluding that\nthey are under a political obligation to that state. Estlund\u2019s\ndefense of what he labels normative consent is subtle and\nsophisticated. Still, one might wonder whether in cases where\nnon-consent is void the duty to submit to another\u2019s authority\nfollows directly from the considerations in virtue of which it is\nwrong for someone not to consent (see Sreenivasan 2009). It is also\nunclear whether there is enough of a connection between the\nagent\u2019s will and her coming to be subject to another\u2019s\nauthority to warrant classifying Estlund\u2019s account as an example\nof consent theory (for responses to both concerns, see Estlund 2008,\npp. 127\u2013131; 2009).\n",
