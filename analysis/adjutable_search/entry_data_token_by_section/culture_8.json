    "main_text": "Minority Cultural Rights Claims || Self-determination rights\n2.3 Self-determination rights\n\nSelf-determination rights are those that confer substantial control to\nsub-state jurisdictions over a particular territory and in particular\nthe right to run the major institutions on that territory. A\nself-determining community is one that, because of control over major\ninstitutions in a territory, is capable of making and enforcing\ndecisions, without interference by outsiders, in multiple policy\nspaces (I. M. Young 2004). The justification for self-determination\nrights is sometimes based on reparation or corrective justice, for\nexample where past state actions have undermined the capacity for a\nparticular cultural group to be self-determining in the first place\n(Song 2009: 184). In other cases, the demand for self-determination is\njustified with respect to the importance of protecting the autonomy of\na culturally distinct sub-state jurisdiction, that is, its capacity to\nrun its own affairs in ways that are consonant with its particular\ncultural preferences. The right to self-determination typically relies\non an understanding of culture-as-encompassing group, or\nculture-as-social-formation, suggesting that without significant\ncontrol over the major institutions that govern the lives of citizens,\nthe relevant group will not be able to be self-determining.\n\nThe right to self-determination is typically attributed to states, so\nits meaning in the context of minority communities operating at the\nsub-state level is not always clear. Among sub-state jurisdictions,\nthe right is often claimed by Indigenous groups as well as sub-state\nnational groups, like the Basques and the Scottish, whose\n\u201csocietal culture\u201d is manifestly distinct from the\nmajority\u2019s societal culture. The demand for self-determination\nis\u00a0a demand to make choices about how children are educated, what\nlanguage is spoken by the relevant political authorities, and how the\npublic space should be organized. The right claimed has at least three\nmanifestations: 1) the right, at a minimum, to \u201cmaintain a\ncomprehensive way of life within the larger society without\ninterference\u201d; 2) the right to recognition by the majority for\nits way of life, and 3) the right to active backing by the majority to\naffirmatively support the relevant way of life so that \u201cthe\nculture can flourish\u201d (Margalit & Halbertal 1994: 498).\nThese three interpretations make distinct demands on the state,\nrunning from simple non-interference to active participation in\nsustaining the conditions for self-determination. As a result, the\nlarger state is sometimes tasked with assessing the extent to which it\nwants to direct its resources to supporting a particular request for\nself-determination, focused on whether associated claims to cultural\npreservation are warranted. These will be considered\u00a0below.\n",
