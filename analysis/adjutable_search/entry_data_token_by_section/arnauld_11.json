    "main_text": "Arnauld and Leibniz\n5. Arnauld and Leibniz\n\nOn February 11, 1686, while the controversy between Arnauld and\nMalebranche was at a peak of intensity, Leibniz wrote to Landgrave\nErnst von Hessen-Rheinfels, asking that the Landgrave send Arnauld a\nsummary of \u201ca short discourse\u201d on \u201cquestions of\ngrace, the concourse of God and creatures, the nature of miracles, the\ncause of sin and the origin of evil, the immortality of the soul,\nideas, etc.\u201d (The Leibniz-Arnauld Correspondence,\nDie Philosophischen Schriften von Leibniz, herausgegeben von K. I.\nGerhardt, Vol. 2, hereinafter LA, 11). The ensuing\ncorrespondence occurred at a crucial point in the development of\nLeibniz\u2019s philosophy. The Discourse on Metaphysics, the\nfinal version of the short discourse, marks the beginning of\nLeibniz\u2019s mature metaphysics, and it shows the influence of the\ncorrespondence with Arnauld.\n\nLeibniz had corresponded with Arnauld some fifteen years earlier, in\nconnection with Leibniz\u2019s efforts to reunite the Christian\nchurches. These efforts took a new turn in March, 1672, when Leibniz,\nthen just 25 years old, left Mainz for Paris on a secret political\nmission for his patron, Baron Johann Christian von Boineburg, who was\nin turn minister to Johann Philipp von Sch\u00f6nborn, the Elector of\nMainz. Both men were converts from Lutheranism to Catholicism.\nLeibniz\u2019s diplomatic mission was a failure, but he had other\nreasons for wanting to visit Paris. He was eager to enter into the\nbrilliant intellectual life of the French capital, and he stayed\nthere, with a brief sojourn in England, until 1676, making the\nacquaintance of a number of leading intellectuals. During this time,\nhe undertook for the first time the serious study of mathematics. But\nhe also continued to work toward a philosophical position that he\nhoped would help reunify the churches.\n\nBefore coming to Paris, he had discussed the project of reunifying the\nchurches with his patron Boineburg, and had corresponded with Arnauld,\nin 1671, about the Eucharist, proposing an account of the real\npresence that he thought would be acceptable to both Lutherans and\nCatholics. But it was Leibniz\u2019s interest in theodicy and related\nproblems about justification that flourished in Paris. There, in 1673,\nhe composed Confessio Philosophi, a dialogue in Latin between\na theologian and a philosopher that is sometimes referred to as\n\u201chis first theodicy.\u201d Thirty-seven years later in the\nTheodicy, Leibniz says,\n\nWhile I was in France, I communicated to M. Arnauld a dialogue I had\nwritten in Latin on the cause of evil and the justice of God. This was\nnot only before his disputes with R. P. Malebranche, but even before\nthe book on The Search after Truth had appeared. The\nprinciple that I here maintain, that sin was permitted because it was\ninvolved in the best plan for the universe, was already employed\nthere, and M. Arnauld did not seem hostile to it. (Theodicy,\n#211).\n\n\nSoon after Leibniz\u2019s arrival in Paris, both Boineborg and von\nSch\u00f6nborn died, and Leibniz turned for support to another\nimportant German noble and convert from Lutheranism to Catholicism,\nJohann Friedrich von Braunschweig-L\u00fcneberg (Hannover). On 26\nMarch 1673, Leibniz wrote as follows to Johann Friedrich:\n\nThe famous Arnauld is a man of the most profound and wide-ranging\nthought that a true philosopher can have; his aim is not only to\nilluminate hearts with the clarity of religion, but, further, to\nrevive the flame of reason, eclipsed by human passions; not only to\nconvert heretics, but, further, those who are today in the greatest\nheresy\u2014the atheists and libertines; not only to vanquish his\nopponents, but, further, to improve those of his persuasion. His\nthoughts, then, come to seeking how, so far as it is possible, a\nreform of abuses, frankly wide-spread among dissidents, would overcome\nthe cause of the division. In this design, on several points of\nimportance, he has made the first step and, as a prudent man, he goes\nby degrees. I am distressed that we have lost von Boineburg just when\nI have struck up an acquaintance with Arnauld; for I had hoped to\nbring these two minds, so similar in their honest soundness, on the\nroad to a closer agreement, The Church, as well as the Fatherland, has\nsustained a loss with this man (Quoted in Sleigh 1990, 15\u201316).\n\n\nThere is no record of any response by Arnauld to the Confessio\nPhilosophi, but when Leibniz returned to the problems of\ntheodicy, in 1686, he once again sought Arnauld\u2019s cooperation by\nsending Arnauld the outline of the Discourse on Metaphysics\nthat was mentioned above. The outline sent to Arnauld was no more than\na list of the propositions that were to appear as the titles of the\nthirty-seven sections of the Discourse; the entire\ncorrespondence was carried out through the intermediary of\nHessen-Rheinfels; and the copies of letters received by the two major\ncorrespondents were sometimes defective. These facts, together with\nthe extreme subtlety of the philosophical contents of the letters,\nhave made interpretation of the correspondence very difficult.\n",
