    "main_text": "Machine Intelligence\n7. Machine Intelligence\n\n\nTuring relished the paradox of \u2018Machine Intelligence\u2019: an\napparent contradiction in terms. It is likely that he was already\nsavouring this theme in 1941, when he read a theological book by the\nauthor Dorothy Sayers (Sayers 1941). In (Turing 1948) he quoted from\nthis work to illustrate his full awareness that in common parlance\n\u2018mechanical\u2019 was used to to mean \u2018devoid of\nintelligence.\u2019 Giving a date which no doubt had his highly\nsophisticated Enigma-breaking machines secretly in mind, he wrote that\n\u2018up to 1940\u2019 only very limited machinery had been used, and\nthis \u2018encouraged the belief that machinery was necessarily\nlimited to extremely straightforward, possibly even to repetitious,\njobs.\u2019 His object was to dispel these connotations. \n\n\nIn 1950, Turing wrote on the first page of his Manual for users of\nthe Manchester University computer (Turing 1950a):\nElectronic computers are intended to carry out any definite\nrule of thumb process which could have been done by a human operator\nworking in a disciplined but unintelligent manner.\n\n\nThis is, of course, just the 1936 universal Turing machine, now in\nelectronic form. On the other hand, he also wrote in the more famous\npaper of that year (Turing 1950b, p. 460)\nWe may hope that machines will eventually compete with men\nin all purely intellectual fields.\n\n\nHow could the intelligent arise from operations which were\nthemselves totally routine and \nmindless\u2014\u2018entirely without intelligence\u2019? This is the core of the\nproblem Turing faced, and the same problem faces Artificial\nIntelligence research today. Turing's underlying argument was that the\nhuman brain must somehow be organised for intelligence, and that the\norganisation of the brain must be realisable as a finite discrete-state\nmachine. The implications of this view were exposed to a wider circle\nin his famous paper, \u201cComputing Machinery and Intelligence,\u201d which\nappeared in Mind in October 1950.\n\n\nThe appearance of this paper, Turing's first foray into a journal of\nphilosophy, was stimulated by his discussions at Manchester University\nwith Michael Polanyi. It also reflects the general sympathy of Gilbert\nRyle, editor of Mind, with Turing's point of view.\n\n\nTuring's 1950 paper was intended for a wide readership, and its fresh and\ndirect approach has made it one of the most frequently cited and republished\npapers in modern philosophical literature. Not surprisingly,\nthe paper has attracted many critiques. Not all commentators note the\ncareful explication of computability which opens the paper, with an\nemphasis on the concept of the universal machine. This explains why if\nmental function can be achieved by any finite discrete state machine,\nthen the same effect can be achieved by programming a computer (Turing\n1950b, p. 442). (Note, however, that Turing makes no claim that the\nnervous system should resemble a digital computer in its structure.)\nTuring's treatment has a severely finitistic flavour: his argument is\nthat the relevant action of the brain is not only computable, but\nrealisable as a totally finite machine, i.e. as a Turing machine that\ndoes not use any \u2018tape\u2019 at all. In his account, the full\nrange of computable functions, defined in terms of Turing machines that\nuse an infinite tape, only appears as being of \u2018special\ntheoretical interest.\u2019 (Of uncomputable functions there is, a\nfortiori, no mention.) Turing uses the finiteness of the nervous\nsystem to give an estimate of about 109 bits\nof storage required for a limited simulation of intelligence (Turing\n1950b, p. 455).\n\n\nThe wit and drama of Turing's \u2018imitation game\u2019 has\nattracted more fame than his careful groundwork. Turing's argument was\ndesigned to bypass discussions of the nature of thought, mind, and\nconsciousness, and to give a criterion in terms of external observation\nalone. His justification for this was that one only judges that other\nhuman beings are thinking by external observation, and he applied a\nprinciple of \u2018fair play for machines\u2019 to argue that the\nsame should hold for machine intelligence. He dramatised this viewpoint\nby a thought-experiment (which nowadays can readily be tried out). A\nhuman being and a programmed computer compete to convince an impartial\njudge, using textual messages alone, as to which is the human being.\nIf the computer wins, it must be credited with intelligence.\n\n\nTuring introduced his \u2018game\u2019 confusingly with a poor\nanalogy: a party game in which a man pretends to be a woman. His loose\nwording (Turing 1950b, p. 434) has led some writers wrongly to suppose\nthat Turing proposed an \u2018imitation game\u2019 in which a machine\nhas to imitate a man imitating a woman. Others, like Lass\u00e8gue\n(1998), place much weight on this game of gender pretence and its real\nor imaginary connotations. In fact, the whole point of the\n\u2018test\u2019 setting, with its remote text-message link, was to\nseparate intelligence from other human faculties and\nproperties. But it may fairly be said that this confusion reflects\nTuring's richly ambitious concept of what is involved in human\n\u2018intelligence\u2019. It might also be said to illustrate his own\nhuman intelligence, in particular a delight in the Wildean reversal of\nroles, perhaps reflecting, as in Wilde, his homosexual identity. His\nfriends knew an Alan Turing in whom intelligence, humour and sex were\noften intermingled.\n\n\nTuring was in fact sensitive to the difficulty of separating\n\u2018intelligence\u2019 from other aspects of human senses and\nactions; he described ideas for robots with sensory attachments and\nraised questions as to whether they might enjoy strawberries and cream\nor feel racial kinship. In contrast, he paid scant attention to the\nquestions of authenticity and deception implicit in his test,\nessentially because he wished to by-pass questions about the reality of\nconsciousness. A subtle aspect of one of his imagined\n\u2018intelligent\u2019 conversations (Turing 1950b, p. 434) is where\nthe computer imitates human intelligence by giving the wrong\nanswer to a simple arithmetic problem. But in Turing's setting we\nare not supposed to ask whether the computer \u2018consciously\u2019\ndeceives by giving the impression of innumerate humanity, nor why it\nshould wish to do so. There is a certain lack of seriousness in this\napproach. Turing took on a second-rank target in countering the\npublished views of the brain surgeon G. Jefferson, as regards the\nobjectivity of consciousness. Wittgenstein's views on Mind would have\nmade a more serious point of departure.\n\n\nTuring's imitation principle perhaps also assumes (like\n\u2018intelligence tests\u2019 of that epoch) too much of a shared\nlanguage and culture for his imagined interrogations. Neither does it\naddress the possibility that there may be kinds of thought, by animals\nor extra-terrestrial intelligences, which are not amenable to\ncommunication.\n\n\nA more positive feature of the paper lies in its constructive\nprogram for research, culminating in Turing's ideas for \u2018learning\nmachines\u2019 and educating \u2018child\u2019 machines (Turing\n1950b, p. 454). It is generally thought (e.g. in Dreyfus and Dreyfus\n1990) that there was always an antagonism between programming and the\n\u2018connectionist\u2019 approach of neural networks. But Turing\nnever expressed such a dichotomy, writing that both approaches should\nbe tried. Donald Michie, the British AI research pioneer profoundly\ninfluenced by early discussions with Turing, has called this suggestion\n\u2018Alan Turing's Buried Treasure\u2019, in an allusion to a\nbizarre wartime episode in which Michie was himself involved (Hodges\n1983, p. 345). The question is still highly pertinent.\n\n\nIt is also a commonly expressed view that Artificial Intelligence\nideas only occurred to pioneers in the 1950s after the success\nof computers in large arithmetical calculations. It is hard to see why\nTuring's work, which was rooted from the outset in the question of\nmechanising Mind, has been so much overlooked. But through his failure\nto publish and promote work such as that in (Turing 1948) he largely\nlost recognition and influence.\n\n\nIt is also curious that Turing's best-known paper should appear in a\njournal of philosophy, for it may well be said that Turing, always\ncommitted to materialist explanation, was not really a philosopher at\nall. Turing was a mathematician, and what he had to offer philosophy\nlay in illuminating its field with what had been discovered in\nmathematics and physics. In the 1950 paper this was surprisingly\ncursory, apart from his groundwork on the concept of computability. His\nemphasis on the sufficiency of the computable to explain the action of\nthe mind was stated more as a hypothesis, even a manifesto, than argued\nin detail. Of his hypothesis he wrote (Turing 1950b, p. 442):\n\u2026I believe that at the end of the century the use of\nwords and general educated opinion will have altered so much that one\nwill be able to speak of machines thinking without expecting to be\ncontradicted. I believe further that no useful purpose is served by\nconcealing these beliefs. The popular view that scientists proceed\ninexorably from established fact to established fact, never being\ninfluenced by any unproved conjecture, is quite mistaken. Provided it\nis made clear which are proved facts and which are conjecture, no harm\ncan result. Conjectures are of great importance since they suggest\nuseful lines of research.\n\n\nPenrose (1994, p.21), probing into Turing's conjecture, has\npresented it as \u2018Turing's thesis\u2019 thus:\nIt seems likely that he viewed physical action in general\u2014which would include the action of a human brain\u2014to be\nalways reducible to some kind of Turing-machine action.\n\n\nThe statement that all physical action is in effect computable goes\nbeyond Turing's explicit words, but is a fair characterisation of the\nimplicit assumptions behind the 1950 paper. Turing's consideration of\n\u2018The Argument from Continuity in the Nervous System,\u2019 in\nparticular, simply asserts that the physical system of the brain can be\napproximated as closely as is desired by a computer program (Turing\n1950b, p. 451). Certainly there is nothing in Turing's work in the\n1945\u201350 period to contradict Penrose's interpretation. The more\ntechnical precursor papers (Turing 1947, 1948) include wide-ranging\ncomments on physical processes, but make no reference to the\npossibility of physical effects being uncomputable.\n\n\nIn particular, a section of (Turing 1948) is devoted to a general\nclassification of \u2018machines.\u2019 The period between 1937 and\n1948 had given Turing much more experience of actual machinery than he\nhad in 1936, and his post-war remarks reflected this in a down-to-earth\nmanner. Turing distinguished \u2018controlling\u2019 from\n\u2018active\u2019 machinery, the latter being illustrated by\n\u2018a bulldozer\u2019. Naturally it is the former\u2014in modern\nterms \u2018information-based machinery\u2019\u2014with which\nTuring's analysis is concerned. It is noteworthy that in 1948 as in\n1936, despite his knowledge of physics, Turing made no mention of how\nquantum mechanics might affect the concept of\n\u2018controlling\u2019. His concept of \u2018controlling\u2019\nremained entirely within the classical framework of the Turing machine\n(which he called a Logical Computing Machine in this paper.)\n\n\nThe same section of (Turing 1948) also drew the distinction between\ndiscrete and continuous machinery, illustrating the\nlatter with \u2018the telephone\u2019 as a continuous, controlling\nmachine. He made light of the difficulty of reducing continuous physics\nto the discrete model of the Turing machine, and though citing\n\u2018the brain\u2019 as a continuous machine, stated that it could\nprobably be treated as if discrete. He gave no indication that physical\ncontinuity threatened the paramount role of computability. In fact, his\nthrust in (Turing 1947) was to promote the digital computer as more\npowerful than analog machines such as the differential analyser.\nWhen he discussed this comparison, he gave the following informal\nversion of the Church-Turing thesis:\nOne of my conclusions was that the idea of a \u2018rule of\nthumb\u2019 process and a \u2018machine process\u2019 were\nsynonymous. The expression \u2018machine process\u2019 of course\nmeans one which could be carried out by the type of machine I was\nconsidering [i.e. Turing machines]\n\n\nTuring gave no hint that the discreteness of the Turing machine\nconstituted a real limitation, or that the non-discrete processes of\nanalog machines might be of any deep significance.\n\n\nTuring also introduced the idea of \u2018random elements\u2019 but\nhis examples (using the digits of \u03c0) showed that he considered\npseudo-random sequences (i.e. computable sequences with\nsuitable \u2018random\u2019 properties) quite adequate for his\ndiscussion. He made no suggestion that randomness implied something\nuncomputable, and indeed gave no definition of the term\n\u2018random\u2019. This is perhaps surprising in view of the fact\nthat his work in pure mathematics, logic and cryptography all gave him\nconsiderable motivation to approach this question at a serious\nlevel.\n",
