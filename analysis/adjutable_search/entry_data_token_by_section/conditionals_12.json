Compounds of Conditionals: Problems for the Suppositional Theory\n\nA common complaint against Supp\u2019s theory is that if conditionals\ndo not express propositions with truth conditions, we have no account\nof the behaviour of compound sentences with conditionals as parts (see\ne.g. Lewis (1976, p. 142)). Probability theory is no help: conditional\nprobabilities never occur inside wider constructions. However, no\ntheory has an intuitively adequate account of compounds of\nconditionals: we saw in \u00a72.4 that there are compounds which Hook\ngets wrong; and compounds which Arrow gets wrong. Grice\u2019s and\nJackson\u2019s defences of Hook focus on what more is needed to\njustify the assertion of a conditional, beyond belief that it\nis true. This is no help when it occurs, unasserted, as a constituent\nof a longer sentence, as Jackson accepts. And with negations of\nconditionals and conditionals in antecedents, we saw, the problem is\nreversed: we assert conditionals which we would not believe if we\nconstrued them truth-functionally.\n\nSome followers of Adams have tried to show that when a sentence with a\nconditional subsentence is intelligible, it can be paraphrased, at\nleast in context, by a sentence without a conditional subsentence. For\ninstance, they read \u201cIt\u2019s not the case that if \\(A,\nB\\)\u201d as \u201cIf \\(A\\), it\u2019s not the case that\n\\(B\\)\u201d, and \u201cIf \\(A\\), then if \\(B, C\\)\u201d as\n\u201cIf \\(A \\amp B, C\\)\u201d. They also point out that some\nconstructions are rarer, and harder to understand, and more peculiar,\nthan would be expected if conditionals had truth conditions and\nembedded in a standard way. See Appiah (1985, pp. 205\u201310),\nGibbard (1981, pp. 234\u20138), Edgington (1995, pp. 280\u20134),\nWoods (1997, pp. 58\u201368 and 120\u20134); see also Jackson (1987,\npp. 127\u201337). (Note that the Lewis-Kratzer strategy (\u00a74.3)\nalso involves paraphrase, so that conditional propositions are not\nembedded in adverbs and operators.) But it would be better to have a\nsystematic solution to this problem, and there have several\nattempts.\n\nThe first attempt to construct a theory of compounds of conditionals,\ncompatible with Supp\u2019s thesis, is due to Bruno de Finetti\n(1936), who, shortly after Ramsey, independently developed a theory of\nprobability as degree of belief, and like Ramsey, saw that conditional\nprobability seemed a good measure of one\u2019s degree of belief in a\nconditional. To deal with compounds of conditionals, he proposed a\nthree-valued semantics for the conditional\u2014true, false,\nundefined. \u201cIf \\(A, B\\)\u201d is true if \\(A \\amp B\\), false if\n\\(A \\amp{\\sim}B\\), and lacks a truth value\u2014is undefined\u2014if\n\\({\\sim}A\\). He called these semantic entities \u201cconditional\nevents\u201d or \u201ctri-events\u201d. The probability of a\nconditional is not the probability of its truth (which is just the\nprobability of \\(A \\amp B)\\), but the probability of its truth given\nthat it is either true or false, which is just the conditional\nprobability of \\(B\\) given \\(A\\). Then de Finetti gave truth tables,\nwhich accommodate compounds of conditionals. A conjunction is true iff\nboth conjuncts are true, false iff at least one conjunct is false,\notherwise undefined. A disjunction is true iff at least one disjunct\nis true, false if both disjuncts are false, otherwise undefined.\nNegation takes true to false, false to true, undefined to undefined. A\nconditional with a false or undefined antecedent is undefined. And the\nprobability of a compound is also the probability that it is true,\ngiven that it is either true or false. For work in this tradition see\nMilne (1997). See also Belnap (1970) and McDermott (1996).\n\nThe idea has a certain appeal. A conditional, if \\(A, B\\), involves\nthe supposition that \\(A\\). It tells us nothing about what happens if\n\\(A\\) is false. But there are costs. On this account, to\nbelieve/assert a conditional is not to believe/assert that it is true.\nIt is no fault in a conditional that it is not true, for it is no\nfault in a conditional that it has a false antecedent. I say \u201cIf\nyou press that button there will be an explosion\u201d. A disaster is\navoided, because, fortunately, my remark was not true. One might say\nthe normative dimension of truth has been lost. We have to give up the\nequivalence between \u201cIf \\(A, B\\)\u201d and \u201cIt is true\nthat if \\(A, B\\)\u201d. Even a necessary conditional such as\n\u201cIf \\(A \\amp B\\), then \\(A\\)\u201d can fail to be true.\nValidity cannot be preservation of truth, for if it were, \u201cIf\n\\(A, B\\); so \\(A \\amp B\\)\u201d would be a valid argument.\n\nFurther, some of the results this theory delivers for embedded\nconditionals are not plausible. Mother says \u201cIf it doesn\u2019t\nrain tomorrow we\u2019ll go to the beach, and if it rains we\u2019ll\ngo to the cinema\u201d. This rightly inspires confident expectations.\nBut on the present theory, as one or the other conditional has a false\nantecedent, the conjunction cannot be true. Yet one or the other\nconditional might be false, due to some unlikely contretemps, such as\nillness, in which case the conjunction is false. So the probability\nthat it is true, given that it is either true or false, is 0. The\nchildren are 99% confident that if \\({\\sim}R, B\\), and 99% confident\nthat if \\(R, C\\), but, on this account, they should be 0% confident\nthat (if \\({\\sim}R, B)\\) & (if \\(R, C)\\). (McGee (1989) raises\nthis objection to the account.)\n\nA second approach gives \u201csemantic values\u201d to conditionals\nas follows: \\(1 (=\\) true) if \\(A \\amp B\\); \\(0 (=\\) false) if \\(A\n\\amp{\\sim}B\\); \\(\\mathbf{p}_A (B)\\) if \\({\\sim}A\\). See van Fraassen\n(1976), McGee (1989), Jeffrey (1991), Stalnaker and Jeffrey (1994),\nSanfilippo et al. (2020). Thus we have a belief-relative three-valued\nentity. Its probability is its \u201cexpected value\u201d. For\ninstance, I\u2019m to pick a ball from a bag. 50% of the balls are\nred. 80% of the red balls have black spots. Consider \u201cIf I pick\na red ball \\((R)\\) it will have a black spot \\((B)\\)\u201d.\n\\(\\mathbf{p}_R (B) = 80\\)%. If \\(R \\amp B\\), the conditional gets\nsemantic value 1, if \\(R \\amp{\\sim}B\\), it gets semantic value 0. What\ndoes it get if \\({\\sim}R\\)? One way of motivating this approach is to\ntreat it as a refinement of Stalnaker\u2019s truth conditions. Is the\nnearest \\(R\\)-world a \\(B\\)-world or not? Well, if I actually\ndon\u2019t pick a red ball, there isn\u2019t any difference, in\nnearness to the actual world, between the worlds in which I do; but\n80% of them are \\(B\\)-worlds. Select an \\(R\\)-world at random; then\nit\u2019s 80% likely that it is a \\(B\\)-world. So \u201cIf \\(R,\nB\\)\u201d gets 80% if \\({\\sim}R\\). You don\u2019t divide the\n\\({\\sim}R\\)-worlds into those in which \u201cIf \\(R, B\\)\u201d is\ntrue and those in which it is false. Instead the conditional gets\nvalue 80% in all of them. The expected value of \u201cIf \\(R,\nB\\)\u201d is \n\n\\[\\begin{align}\n(\\mathbf{p}(R \\amp B) &\\times 1) + (\\mathbf{p}(R \\amp{\\sim}B) \\times 0) +\n(\\mathbf{p}({\\sim}R) \\times 0.8)) \\\\\n&= (0.4 \\times 1) + (0.1 \\times 0) + (0.5 \\times 0.8) \\\\\n&= 0.8 \\\\\n&= \\mathbf{p}_R (B).\n\\end{align}\\]\n\n\nWays of handling compounds of conditionals have been proposed on the\nbasis of these semantic values.\n\nSome of the difficulties of the former account are avoided. Necessary\nconditionals like \u201cIf \\(A \\amp B\\), then \\(A\\)\u201d are\ntrue\u2014get value 1. Conjunctions of the form (if \\(A, B)\\) &\n(if \\({\\sim}A, C)\\) do not all get 0. Indeed, conditionals this form\nalways get the value \\(\\mathbf{p}_A (B).\\mathbf{p}_{{\\sim}A}(C)\\).\n(The expected value of the conjunction if \\(\\mathbf{p}(A \\amp\nB).\\mathbf{p}_{{\\sim}A}(C) + \\mathbf{p}({\\sim}A \\amp C).\\mathbf{p}_A\n(B)\\), which simplifies to \\(\\mathbf{p}_A\n(B).\\mathbf{p}_{{\\sim}A}(C)\\).) Indeed, the stronger result holds,\nthat if the two antecedents are incompatible, the value of the\nconjunction is the product of the two conditional probabilities. So\nour above example about rain, beach and cinema indeed gets a high\nvalue.\n\nHowever, this result for conjunctions of conditionals gives some\nimplausible results. An example due to Mark Lance (1991) concerns a\nwerewolf, such that it\u2019s 50% likely that it is our area tonight.\nIf it is, it will kill everyone outside. \u201cIf John went out, he\nwas killed\u201d gets 0.5. But \u201cIf John went out the back door,\nhe was killed, and if John went out the front door, he was\nkilled\u201d gets 0.25 on this proposal, whereas it should still get\n0.5. Another example, due to Richard Bradley: I must pick one of two\nurns, only one of which contains the prize. \u201cIf I pick the left\nurn, I\u2019ll win\u201d gets 0.5. \u201cIf I pick the right urn,\nI\u2019ll win\u201d gets 0.5. On this proposal, \u201cIf I pick the\nleft urn I\u2019ll win, and if I pick the right urn, I\u2019ll\nwin\u201d gets 0.25, whereas it surely deserves to get 0.\n\nThe flaw in this proposal is that the conditional gets the same value\nin every possible situation in which the antecedent is false. In our\nsecond example, in the \u201cpick left and win\u201d situation,\n\u201cIf pick right, win\u201d deserves 0, not 0.5, despite its\nfalse antecedent, and in the \u201cpick left and lose\u201d\nsituation, \u201cIf pick right, win\u201d deserves 1, not 0.5. In\nthe werewolf example, in the \u201cgoes out front door and is\nkilled\u201d situation, \u201cIf back door, killed\u201d deserves\n1, not 0.5, despite its false antecedent. This point is made by\nBradley (2012), who has a different approach.\n\nBradley\u2019s account can be seen as a modification of\nStalnaker\u2019s (1968) theory discussed in \u00a74.1: consider a\npossible world in which \\(A\\) is true, and otherwise differs minimally\nfrom the actual world; \u201cIf \\(A\\), then \\(B\\)\u201d is true just\nin case \\(B\\) is true in that possible world. First modification:\nBradley abandons the notion of similarity, or of minimal difference,\nin favour of a probability distribution over the candidate A-worlds.\nThe example of the short straws in \u00a74.1 shows that this is a good\nidea. Second modification: conditionals are not propositions. This is\na suppositional theory. Conditionals involve two propositions which\nplay different roles, one a supposition, one a judgement within its\nscope. They cannot be represented by the set of worlds in which they\nare true. Indeed, conditionals are not ingredients of\nworlds\u2014they are cross-world entities. Bradley proposes that the\nconditional \u201cif \\(A, B\\)\u201d can be represented by the set of\npairs of worlds, \\(\\langle w_i, w_j\\rangle\\) such that, if\n\\(w_i\\) is actual, and \\(w_j\\) is the \u201cnearest\u201d\n\\(A\\)-world, i.e. the world that would be actual if \\(A\\) were true,\nthe conditional would be true (because \\(B\\) is true at \\(w_j)\\).\nNote: \u201cnearest\u201d does not mean \u201cmost similar\u201d.\nThere is no ordering of worlds for similarity. It means the world that\nwould be actual if \\(A\\) were true. Often, we do not know which world\nthat is\u2014hence the probability distribution over candidates.\nSometimes it might even be indeterminate which world that is, but\nreflection again on the \u201cshort straws\u201d example in\n\u00a74.1 shows that the probabilities are still in order.\n\nTwo types of uncertainty, Bradley notes, are involved in assessing a\nconditional\u2014uncertainty about the facts\u2014about which world\nis actual; and uncertainty about what would be the case if some\nsupposition, which may be false, were true. These combine in a joint\nprobability distribution over the set of ordered pairs.\n\nHe accepts centering: if \\(A\\) is true, the \u201cnearest\u201d\n\\(A\\)-world is the actual world, and the conditional is true iff \\(B\\)\nis true.\n\nHere is a simple model. There are just three possible worlds: at\n\\(w_1, A\\) and \\(B\\) are true; at \\(w_2, A\\) is true and \\(B\\) is\nfalse; at \\(w_3, A\\) is false. These generate the following\npossibilities for the conditional if \\(A, B\\).\n\n\n\n\n\nIf \\(A, B\\) \n\n\\(w_1\\)\n\\(A,B\\)\n\\(\\langle w_1,w_1\\rangle\\)\nT \n\n\\(w_2\\)\n\\(A,{\\sim}B\\)\n\\(\\langle w_2,w_2\\rangle\\)\nF \n\n\\(w_3\\)\n\\({\\sim}A\\)\n\\(\\langle w_3,w_1\\rangle\\)\nT \n\n\\(w_3\\)\n\\({\\sim}A\\)\n\\(\\langle w_3,w_2\\rangle\\)\nF \n\n\nThe probabilities of these four lines sum to 1.\n\nThe first two lines are the cases in which the antecedent is true, so\nin those the \u201cnearest\u201d world is the actual world. If on\nthe other hand \\(w_3\\) is actual, that does not tell us whether the\nnearest \\(A\\)-world is \\(w_1\\), in which case the conditional is true,\nor \\(w_2\\), in which case the conditional is false.\n\nThe crucial rule governing this non-propositional entity is this: the\nprobability of \u201cif \\(A, B\\)\u201d given \\(A\\), is the same as\nthe probability of \u201cif \\(A, B\\)\u201d given \\({\\sim}A\\); the\nprobability of the conditional is independent of its antecedent. This\nguarantees that \\(\\mathbf{p}\\)(if \\(A, B) = \\mathbf{p}_A (B)\\).\n\nThe non-propositional nature of the conditional is essential here.\nSuppose we just redescribe the four lines above as four possible\nworlds, four ways the world might be, in two of which the conditional\nis true\u2014as Stalnaker did. And suppose we start off thinking each\nof the four is equally likely. Then we learn \\({\\sim}(A \\amp B)\\): the\nfirst line goes out. We learn nothing other than that. \\(\\mathbf{p}_A\n(B)\\) is now 0. But \\(\\mathbf{p}\\)(if \\(A, B)\\) is not 0: the third\nline remains a possibility, and we haven\u2019t eliminated that.\n(Indeed, if probabilities change by conditionalization, the third line\nnow has probability 1/3.) In short, no two contingent propositions are\nprobabilistically independent in all probability distributions. But\nthe conditional\u2014not a proposition\u2014is stipulated to be\nindependent of \\(A\\). On Bradley\u2019s theory, having learned that\n\\({\\sim}(A \\amp B), \\mathbf{p}_A (B) = \\mathbf{p}\\)(if \\(A, B) = 0\\);\nthe third line gets 0; should \\(A\\) turn out to be false, it\u2019s\nfalse that if \\(A, B\\).\n\nWith this machinery, the contents of conjunctions, disjunctions and\nnegations of conditionals are given in the usual way by intersection,\nunion and complements of the contents of the component sentences. When\na sentence has two conditionals, with two antecedents, such as those\nof the form \\((A\\Rightarrow B) \\amp({\\sim}A\\Rightarrow C)\\), their\nsemantics requires not ordered pairs but ordered triples, \\(\\langle\nw_i, w_j, w_k\\rangle\\), such that, if \\(w_i\\) is actual and \\(w_j\\) is\nthe nearest \\(A\\)-world, and wk is the nearest \\({\\sim}A\\)-world, the\nconditional is true. As it is perfectly proper to give probabiity 0 to\nthe possibility: \u201cI pick right and win, and in the nearest world\nin which I pick left, I win\u201d, the problem for the previous\nproposal is avoided.\n\nThis is a remarkable achievement. Probability is probability of truth.\nValidity is necessary preservation of truth, and so Adams\u2019s\nprobabilistic criterion of validity is demonstrable. If B is\ntrue/false at all \\(A\\)-worlds, \\(A\\Rightarrow B\\) is\nstraightforwardly true/false. Plenty of others may be\nstraightforwardly true/false, whether or not we know this. The many\nuncertain conditionals come out with the right probability\u2014the\nconditional probability of \\(B\\) given \\(A\\). The construction is not\neasy to work with, but it is a sort of possibility proof\u2014that\nthe embeddings objection can be met. (Bradley also has a suggested\napproach to conditionals within conditionals, but this has not been\nworked out in detail.)\n\nIt is not ad hoc or unheard-of to claim that some kinds of content\ncannot be represented by a set of worlds\u2014the set of worlds in\nwhich they are true. Some examples: to capture the content of\nindexical thoughts using \u201cI\u201d and \u201cnow\u201d, we\nneed the richer notion of a \u201ccentred world\u201d\u2014an\nordered triple of a world, and individual and a time (see Lewis 1979).\nGibbard (1990) proposes that the content of a normative judgement can\nbe represented by a set of ordered pairs \\(\\langle w, n\\rangle\\) where\nw is a world and n is a set of norms. Moss (2018) argues that the\ncontents of probability judgements are not propositions but sets of\nprobability spaces. And Bacon (2018) argues that the contents of vague\nthoughts cannot be represented by a set of worlds. (He calls them\npropositions nevertheless\u2014that is a verbal issue\u2014but they\nare not propositions in the sense that is relevant here.)\n\nI shall end this section by discussing a notorious example of Vann\nMcGee\u2019s (1985)\u2014a counterexample to modus ponens. Before\nReagan\u2019s first election, Reagan was hot favourite, a second\nRepublican, Anderson, was a complete outsider, and Carter was lagging\nwell behind Reagan. Consider first\n\nIf a Republican wins and Reagan does not win, then Anderson will\nwin.\n\n\nAs these are the only two Republicans in the race, (1) is\nunassailable. Now consider \n\nIf a Republican wins, then if Reagan does not win, Anderson will\nwin.\n\n\nWe read (2) as equivalent to (1), hence also unassailable. \n\nSuppose I\u2019m close to certain (say, 90% certain) that Reagan will\nwin. Hence I am close to certain that\n\nA Republican will win.\n\n\nBut I don\u2019t believe \n\nIf Reagan does not win, Anderson will win.\n\n\nI\u2019m less than 1% certain that (4). On the contrary, I believe\nthat if Reagan doesn\u2019t win, Carter will win. As these opinions\nseem sensible, we have a prima facie counterexample to modus ponens: I\naccept (2) and (3), but reject (4). Truth conditions or not, valid\narguments obey the probability-preservation principle. I\u2019m 100%\ncertain that (2), 90% certain that (3), but less than 1% certain that\n(4).\n\nHook saves modus ponens by claiming that I must accept (4). For Hook,\n(4) is equivalent to \u201cEither Reagan will win or Anderson will\nwin\u201d. As I\u2019m 90% certain that Reagan will win, I must\naccept this disjunction, and hence accept (4). Hook\u2019s reading of\n(4) is, of course, implausible.\n\nArrow saves modus ponens by claiming that, although (1) is certain,\n(2) is not equivalent to (1), and (2) is almost certainly false. For\nStalnaker,\n\nIf a Republican wins, then if Reagan doesn\u2019t win, Carter\nwill win\n\n\nis true. To assess (5), we need to consider the nearest world in which\na Republican wins (call it \\(w)\\), and ask whether the conditional\nconsequent is true at \\(w\\). At \\(w\\), almost certainly, it is Reagan\nwho wins. We need now to consider the nearest world to \\(w\\) in which\nReagan does not win. Call it \\(w'\\). In \\(w'\\), almost certainly,\nCarter wins.\n\nStalnaker\u2019s reading of (2) is implausible; intuitively, we\naccept (2) as equivalent to (1), and do not accept (5).\n\nSupp can save modus ponens by denying that the argument is really of\nthat form. \u201c\\(A\\Rightarrow B\\); \\(A\\); so \\(B\\)\u201d is\ndemonstrably valid when \\(A\\) and \\(B\\) are propositions. For\ninstance, if \\(\\mathbf{p}(A) = 90\\)% and \\(\\mathbf{p}_A (B) = 90\\)%\nthe lowest possible value for \\(\\mathbf{p}(B)\\) is 81%. The\n\u201cconsequent\u201d of (2), \u201cIf Reagan doesn\u2019t win,\nAnderson will win\u201d, is not a proposition. The argument is really\nof the form \u201cIf \\(A \\amp B\\), then \\(C\\); \\(A\\); so if \\(B\\)\nthen \\(C\\)\u201d. This argument form is invalid (Supp and Stalnaker\nagree). It is one of the many argument forms which do preserve\ncertainty, but do not preserve high probability. Take the case where\n\\(C = A\\), and we have \u201cIf \\(A \\amp B\\) then \\(A\\); \\(A\\); so if\n\\(B\\) then \\(A\\)\u201d. The first premise is a tautology and falls\nout as redundant; and we are left with \u201c\\(A\\); so if \\(B\\) then\n\\(A\\)\u201d. We have already seen that this is invalid: I can think\nit very likely that Sue is lecturing right now, without thinking that\nif she was seriously injured on her way to work, she is lecturing\nright now.\n\nI have put this in the terms of the kind of suppositionalist who\neliminates the embedded conditional by paraphrase. If we do develop a\nsystematic account of the embedded conditional, it is surely a\ndesideratum that (1) and (2) are equivalent. In that case, modus\nponens is fine for propositions, but not when applied to a consequent\nwhich is not a proposition.\n\nCompounds of conditionals are a hard problem for everyone. It is\ndifficult to see why this should be so if conditionals are\npropositions with truth conditions. \n",
