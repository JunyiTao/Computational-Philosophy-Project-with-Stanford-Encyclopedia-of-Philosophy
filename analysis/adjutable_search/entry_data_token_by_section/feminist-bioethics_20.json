    "main_text": "Continuing Evolution || Incorporating theoretical developments\n6.3 Incorporating theoretical developments\n\nFeminist bioethics continues to change under the influence of ongoing\nconceptual work in feminist and mainstream philosophy. One notable\ndevelopment over the last quarter century is the rise of\nintersectionality. First formally articulated by Kimberl\u00e9\nCrenshaw in 1989, intersectionality suggests that when identities or\nsocial groupings intersect, they do so in ways that generate novel\nexperiences that are not reducible to the sum of individual categories\n(Crenshaw 1989; Hill Collins & Bilge 2016). A disabled woman, for\nexample, will face some unique barriers to adequate healthcare that\nwould not be encountered by either a disabled man or a non-disabled\nwoman; these would be barriers that do not track neatly according to\nsex and disability, but reflect the interaction of both. For any\ntheorists of justice and equality, including bioethicists, the\nintersectionalities of sex, gender, race, class, sexual orientation,\nand so on, should be illuminating. Although not yet widely\ndisseminated throughout mainstream bioethics, intersectionality has\nbeen taken up with enthusiasm by feminist bioethics for its ability to\ngenerate powerful analyses of the ways in which social\nidentities\u2014the particularities of who one is and how one is\npositioned in society\u2014affect health and healthcare.\n\nFeminist bioethics is also responding to developments in the\nconceptualization of sex and gender. Thinking about the meaning of\nbeing a woman has always been of interest to feminism, for obvious\nreasons, but this engagement has been given new life by contemporary\nactivity in the areas of gender identification and reassignment. Given\nthe role that biomedicine and the pharmaceutical industry continue to\nplay here, it is unsurprising that bioethicists are exploring the\ncontroversies around clinical interventions in the management of\nintersex persons and in gender reassignment, for example. Feminist\nbioethicists have described the barriers to effective healthcare\nencountered by both transwomen and transmen, including practical\nissues such as lack of privacy in healthcare settings, as well as lack\nof knowledge and discriminatory attitudes on the part of healthcare\nproviders (Harbin et al. 2012; Freeman 2018; Drouillard 2021).\nIntersex individuals encounter related issues (Feder 2014). The social\nand biological nature of women\u2019s identity is currently a highly\nfraught area of feminist theory and activism, with some concerned to\nensure that any framework of rights that takes account of gender\nself-definition and reassignment continues to protect the rights and\nneeds of cis or natal women (Nelson 2016).\n\nFeminist bioethics has always had an international feel to it,\nreflecting not just the commonality of women\u2019s shared experience\nbut also an awareness of the global economic and political systems\nthat generate locally specific instances of injustice to women and\nother marginalized groups. In this vein, feminist bioethicists have\nconsidered the health needs of people living in economically\ndisadvantaged areas, the skewed distribution of health research and\ncare resources across societies and the world, and the global\ndominance of western, highly technologized medicine that often diverts\nresources from more basic healthcare services. Other authors examine\nthe impact on women of international health policy, including formal\ninstruments such as the UNESCO Declaration on Universal Norms on\nBioethics (Rawlinson & Donchin 2005).\n\nHowever, during the final decade of the twentieth century it became\nclear throughout the women\u2019s movement that the sense of global\ncommonality through shared experience might be thinner than it seemed.\nBlack women and women of color, Indigenous women, and others protested\nthe exclusion of their own histories and perspectives from feminist\nthinking and activism \u2013 including feminist bioethics (Mohanty 2003).\nMost recently, bioethicists have responded to calls for the\ndecolonization of bioethical research and teaching (Obasogie &\nDarnovsky 2018; Richardson 2019; Shahvisi 2019). Decolonization\ndescribes the awareness that the past 500 or so years of human history\nhave been shaped by colonial power and that coloniality continues to\nstructure our systems of knowledge to this day. Arianne Shahvisi\ndescribes decolonization as\n\n\nthe systematic uncovering, announcing and destabilizing of coloniality\nin the topics of study, methodologies, training and culture \u2026.\n(Shahvisi 2022, 351).\n\n\nShe argues that as a normative discipline, feminist bioethics has a\nparticular obligation not just to note and examine the gendered,\nracialized, and geographical patterns of suffering that result from\ncoloniality, but also to end them (Shahvisi 2022). Feminist approaches\nthat take into account the particularity of women\u2019s experience\nand that are sensitive to the effects of local and global power\ndynamics are therefore well-placed to lead bioethics beyond treating\nthe concerns of the global South as a set of distant issues (Diniz\n& V\u00e9lez 2001; De Castro 2001; Khader 2013; Ganguli-Mitra\n2021). While decolonization generates deep tensions within the academy\nas a whole, the willingness to face the theoretical, professional, and\npolitical tensions that result is part of the critical and avowedly\nself-critical nature of feminist bioethics.\n",
