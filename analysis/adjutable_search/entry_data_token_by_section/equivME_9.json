    "main_text": "Philosophical interpretations of \\(E_o = mc^2\\) || Same-property interpretations of \\(E_o = mc^2\\)\n2.2 Same-property interpretations of \\(E_o = mc^2\\)\n\nThe first interpretation we will consider asserts that mass and energy\nare the same property of physical systems. Consequently,\nthere is no sense in which one of the properties is ever physically\nconverted into the other.\n\nPhilosophers such as Torretti (1996) and physicists such as Eddington\n(1929) have adopted the same-property interpretation. For example,\nEddington states that \u201cit seems very probable that mass and\nenergy are two ways of measuring what is essentially the same thing,\nin the same sense that the parallax and distance of a star are two\nways of expressing the same property of location\u201d (1929, p.\n146). According to Eddington, the distinction between mass and energy\nis artificial. We treat mass and energy as different properties of\nphysical systems because we routinely measure them using different\nunits. However, one can measure mass and energy using the same units\nby choosing units in which \\(c = 1\\), i.e., units in which distances\nare measured in units of time (e.g., light-years). Once we do this,\nEddington claims, the distinction between mass and energy\ndisappears.\n\nLike Eddington, Torretti points out that mass and energy seem\nto be different properties because they are measured in different\nunits. Speaking against Bunge\u2019s (1967) view that their numerical\nequivalence does not entail that mass and energy \u201care\nthe same thing,\u201d Torretti explains:\n\nIf a kitchen refrigerator can extract mass from a given jug of water\nand transfer it by heat radiation or convection to the kitchen wall\nbehind it, a trenchant metaphysical distinction between the mass and\nthe energy of matter does seem far fetched (1996, p.\u00a0307,\nfn.\u00a013).\n\n\nFor Torretti, the very existence of physical processes in which the\nemission of energy by an object is correlated with the decrease in the\nobject\u2019s mass in accordance with Einstein\u2019s equation\nspeaks strongly against the view that mass and energy are somehow\ndistinct properties of physical systems. Torretti continues:\n\nOf course, if lengths and times are measured with different, unrelated\nunits, the \u2018mass\u2019\u2026 differs conceptually from the\n\u2018energy.\u2019 But this difference can be understood as a\nconsquence of the convenient but deceitful act of the mind by which we\nabstract time and space from nature (1996, p.\u00a0307, fn.\u00a013).\n\n\nThus, this footnote in his masterly Relativity and Geometry\nsuggests that, for Torretti, we are misled into using different units\nfor mass and energy merely because of how we perceive space and time.\nAs we have seen, one can use the same units for mass and energy by\nadopting the convention Torretti himself uses of selecting units in\nwhich \\(c = 1\\) (pp. 88\u201389). However, it may be useful to\nremember that merely using the same units for spatial and temporal\nintervals does not entail that space and time are treated \u201con a\npar\u201d in special relativity; they are not, as is evident from the\nsignature of the Minkwoski metric.\n\nThe main merit of Torretti\u2019s view is that it takes very\nseriously the unification of space and time effected by special\nrelativity and so famously announced in the opening lines of Minkowski\n(1908). It is also consistent with how mass and energy are treated in\ngeneral relativity.\n\nInterpretations such as Torretti\u2019s and Eddington\u2019s draw no\nfurther ontological conclusions from mass-energy equivalence. For\nexample, neither Eddington nor Torretti make any explicit claim\nconcerning whether properties are best understood as universals, or\nwhether one ought to be a realist about such properties. Finally, by\nsaying that mass and energy are the same, these thinkers are\nsuggesting that the denotation of the terms \u201cmass\u201d and\n\u201cenergy\u201d is the same, though they recognize that the\nconnotation of these terms is clearly different.\n",
