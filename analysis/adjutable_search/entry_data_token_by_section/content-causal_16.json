    "main_text": "General Objections to Causal Theories of Mental Content || Causal Theories do not Provide a Metasemantic Theory\n5. Concluding Remarks\n\nAlthough philosophers and cognitive scientists frequently propose to\ndispense with (one or another sort of) mental representation (cf.,\ne.g., Stich, 1983, Brooks, 1991, van Gelder, 1995, Haugeland, 1999,\nJohnson, 2007, Chemero, 2009), this is universally accepted to be a\nrevolutionary shift in thinking about minds. Short of taking on board\nsuch radical views, one will naturally want some explanation of how\nmental representations arise. In attempting such explanations, causal\ntheories have been widely perceived to have numerous attractive\nfeatures. If, for example, one use for mental representations is to\nhelp one keep track of events in the world, then some causal\nconnection between mind and world makes sense. This attractiveness has\nbeen enough to motivate new causal theories (e.g. Rupert, 1999, Usher,\n2001, and Ryder, 2004), despite the widespread recognition of serious\nchallenges to an earlier generation of theories developed by Stampe,\nDretske, Fodor, and others.\n",
