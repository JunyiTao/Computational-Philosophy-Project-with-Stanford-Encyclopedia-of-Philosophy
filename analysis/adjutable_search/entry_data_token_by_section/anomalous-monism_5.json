    "main_text": "Premise II: The Cause-Law Principle\n3. Premise II: The Cause-Law Principle\n\nThe cause-law principle states that events related as cause and effect\nare covered by strict laws. In the earliest formulations of Anomalous\nMonism, Davidson assumed but did not argue for this principle. His\nlater argument in support of it will be considered below\n (3.2),\n along with objections to the principle\n (3.3).\n But we need to consider the nature of the requirement contained in\nthis claim, and how it relates to the framework out of which Anomalous\nMonism is deduced.\n",
