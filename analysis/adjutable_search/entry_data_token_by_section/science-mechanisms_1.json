    "main_text": "The Concept of a Mechanism\n2. The Concept of a Mechanism\nThe term \u201cmechanism\u201d emerged in the seventeenth century\nand derived from Greek and Latin terms for \u201cmachine\u201d\n(Dijksterhuis 1961). Descartes understood mechanics as the basic\nbuilding block of the physical world; in Le Monde, he\nproposed to explain diverse phenomena in the natural world (such as\nplanetary motion, the tides, the motion of the blood, and the\nproperties of light) in terms of the conservation of inertial motion\nthrough contact action (see the entry on\n Ren\u00e9 Descartes). Subsequently, the\n idea of mechanism has been\ntransformed many times to reflect an evolving understanding of the\nbasic causal forces in the world (besides conserved motion): e.g.,\nattraction and repulsion (du Bois Reymond), conservation of energy\n(Helmholtz), gravitational attraction (Newton) (Boas 1952; Westfall\n1971; see also entries on\n Hermann von Helmholtz and\n Isaac Newton). The concept\nof mechanism has had an almost separate evolution in the history of\nthe life sciences (Allen 2005; Des Chene 2001, 2005; Nicholson 2012),\nat times eschewing the metaphysical austerity embraced by Descartes\nand many early mechanists.\nThe new mechanists inherit the word \u201cmechanism\u201d from\nthese antecedents, but, in their effort to capture how the term is\nused in contemporary science, have distanced themselves both from the\nidea that mechanisms are machines and especially from the austere\nmetaphysical world picture in which all real change involves only one\nor a limited set of fundamental activities or forces (cf. Andersen\n2014a,b). \nMechanists have generally eschewed the effort to spell out\nnecessary and sufficient conditions for something to be a\nmechanism. Instead, they offer qualitative descriptions designed to\ncapture the way scientists use the term and deploy the concept in\ntheir experimental and inferential practices.\nThree characterizations are most commonly cited:\n\nMDC: \u201cMechanisms are entities and activities organized such\nthat they are productive of regular changes from start or set-up to\nfinish or termination conditions\u201d (2000: 3).\nGlennan: \u201cA mechanism for a behavior is a complex system\nthat produces that behavior by the interaction of a number of parts,\nwhere the interaction between parts can be characterized by direct,\ninvariant, change-relating generalizations\u201d (2002: S344).\nBechtel and Abrahamsen: \u201cA mechanism is a structure\nperforming a function in virtue of its component parts, component\noperations, and their organization. The orchestrated functioning of\nthe mechanism is responsible for one or more phenomena\u201d (2005:\n423).\n\nEach of these characterizations contains four basic features: (1) a\nphenomenon, (2) parts, (3) causings, and (4) organization. We consider\neach of these in detail below.\nA useful canonical visual representation of a mechanism underlying\na phenomenon is shown in Figure 1 (from Craver 2007). At the top is\nthe phenomenon, some system S engaged in\nbehavior \u03c8. This is the behavior of the mechanism as a\nwhole. Beneath it are the parts (the Xs) and their activities\n(the \u03c6s) organized together. The dotted roughly-vertical lines\nreflect the fact that the parts and activities are contained within,\nare components of, the mechanism engaged in this behavior. Thus represented,\nmechanisms are decompositional in the sense that the behavior of the\nsystem as a whole can be broken down into organized interactions among\nthe activities of the parts.\n\n\nFigure 1. A visual representation of a\nmechanism (adapted from Craver 2007).\n\nIn the early literature, these different characterizations were\noften treated as competitors. Tabery (2004) argued instead that they\nreflect different, and complementary, emphases and intellectual\norientations. Many mechanists have adopted this ecumenical stance. For\nexample, Illari and Williamson offer a \u201cconsensus concept\u201d\nof mechanism:\nA mechanism for a phenomenon consists of entities\nand activities organized in such a way that they are responsible for\nthe phenomenon. (2012: 120)\nLikewise, Glennan refers to \u201cminimal\n mechanism\u201d:\nA mechanism for a phenomenon consists of entities\n(or parts) whose activities and interactions are organized in such a\nway that they produce the phenomenon. (Glennan forthcoming: Ch.\n2) \nThese ecumenical characterizations each include the four basic\nelements and are designed to make the characterization more inclusive.\nMDC\u2019s insistence on the regularity of mechanisms is abandoned, for\nexample, to accommodate mechanisms that work only once or that work\nirregularly (Skipper and Milstein 2005; Bogen 2005; see\nalso Section 2.1.2 below). Bechtel and Abrahamsen\u2019s\nemphasis on the \u201cfunctions\u201d is abandoned to accommodate\nmechanisms that serve no end and to distance mechanism from this\nloaded term so often opposed to mechanism (although see Craver 2001a;\nGarson 2013; Maley and Piccinini forthcoming; see\nalso Section 4.5 below).\nThese ecumenical characterizations intentionally downplay the fact\nthat the term \u201cmechanism\u201d is used differently in different\nscientific and philosophical contexts (see Levy 2013 and Andersen\n2014a,b for alternative overviews of the differences). Indeed, much of\nthe progress in the early years involved learning to recognize the\nmany ways that the term \u201cmechanism\u201d can be used and the\nmany commitments that can be undertaken in its name. (For still other\ncharacterizations of mechanism, see Woodward (2002), Fagan (2012),\nNicholson (2012), and Garson (2013)). Taking these ecumenical views as\na starting point, we now consider the four basic components: 1) the\nphenomenon, 2) parts, 3) causings, and 4) organization.\n",
