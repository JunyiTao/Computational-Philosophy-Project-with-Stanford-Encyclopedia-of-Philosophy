    "main_text": "Theories, models, and explanations || Explanatory Pluralism\n2.3 Explanatory Pluralism\n\nExplanatory pluralism can be understood as a special case of\nrepresentational pluralism with important consequences for\ninterdisciplinary approaches that are linked to the prospects of\nrelating different types and levels of explanations. The diversity of\nexplanatory strategies in scientific practice is well-documented\nacross a wide range of scientific fields such as biology (Braillard\n& Malaterre 2015) cognitive science (Dale, Dietrich, & Chemero\n2009) and paleobiology (Grantham 1999). This diversity may reflect\nheterogeneous views on what may count as an explanation (see\n section 4.3\n on pluralism about epistemic concepts) or/and a diversity of views on\nwhat the proper grain or level of explanation should be.\n\nA common account of the sources of explanatory pluralism is pragmatic:\nwhich type, which level or grain of explanation is sought depends on\nthe questions being asked (e.g., van Bouwel, Weber, & De Vreese\n2011; McCauley & Bechtel 2001), which vary with epistemic and\npractical interests. A more radical take on the issue goes further by\ncontending that there is no objective reason to prefer\nmacro-explanations over micro-explanations (or vice-versa), such a\nchoice being a matter of taste (Sober 1999: 551).\n\nWidely discussed in the pluralist literature is the nature of the\nrelationship between various available explanations of a given\nphenomenon. Consider for example the study of health inequalities. Two\nmain levels of explanation are offered by social epidemiology and\nmolecular epidemiology. What is the relationship between these two\ntypes of explanation? Is it an instance of \u201ccompetitive\u201d\npluralism or of \u201ccompatible\u201d pluralism, in\nMitchell\u2019s terminology (1992)? For proponents of\n\u201ccompetitive\u201d pluralism, the co-existence of competing\nexplanations is temporary, allowing scientific communities to keep\nopen several lines of research until one of them can be identified as\nthe right one (Beatty 1987; Kitcher 1990). By contrast, compatible\npluralism does not consider the existence of alternative types of\nexplanations temporary but reflecting the complexity of multilevel,\nmulticomponent target systems, lending themselves to integration\nrather than competition (Mitchell 2003, 2009). A more fine-grained\ntypology distinguishes six types of explanatory pluralism covering\nvarious kinds of relationships (or lack thereof) between explanations\n(anything goes pluralism, isolationist pluralism, interactive\npluralism, integrative pluralism, temporary pluralism and explanatory\nreductionism) (Van Bouwel 2014, building on further distinctions\ndeveloped by Mitchell [2003] and Longino [2013]). More domain specific\ntypologies have also been proposed, such as Marchionni\u2019s (2008)\ndistinction between \u201cweak complementarity\u201d and\n\u201cstrong complementarity\u201d of explanations available on\nmacro and micro levels in the social sciences. To what extent these\noptions are compatible depends, not surprisingly, on the exact content\nassigned to them.\n\nGiven the ubiquitous institutional pleas for more interdisciplinary\nresearch, a crucial task for pluralist philosophers is to investigate\nwhen interactive and integrative approaches may be more successful\nthan isolationist or reductionist ones. Most attempts at addressing\nthis issue have been domain specific and often push at the end for\nintegration of explanations (e.g., McCauley & Bechtel 2001 on\npsychology and neuroscience, Kendler 2005 on psychiatry, Mitchell 2009\non social insect behavior). By contrast, limitations to integrative\ntendencies have been identified as resulting from general\nconsiderations on the very structure of explanations (Gijsbers 2016).\nIn any case, much more philosophical work needs to be done on the\nnotion of integration, what exactly it amounts to in practice and\nunder which conditions it may succeed (Muszynski & Malaterre\n2020).\n",
