    "main_text": "The Subject Matter of Linguistic Theories || Linguistic Ontology\n2.4 Linguistic Ontology\n\nNot all Essentialists agree that linguistics studies aspects of what\nis in the mind or aspects of what is human. There are some who do not\nsee language as either mental or human, and certainly do not regard\nlinguists as working on a problem within cognitive psychology or\nneurophysiology. The debate on the ontology of language has seen three\nmajor options emerging in the literature. Besides the mentalism of\nChomskyan linguistics, Katz (1981), Katz and Postal (1991) and Postal\n(2003) proffered a platonistic alternative and finally nominalism was\nproposed by Devitt (2006).\n\nHowever, the Katzian trichotomy is no longer a useful characterisation\nof the state-of-the-art in linguistic ontology. For one thing,\nKatzian-style linguistic Platonism has very few if any extant\nadherents. One reason for this situation is that linguistic platonists\nattempt to restage the debate on the foundations and metaphysics of\nnatural language within the philosophy of mathematics (see Katz\n1996). But even if this move was legitimate, it would only have opened\nup a range of possibilities including nominalism (Field 1980; Azzouni\n2004), structuralism (Hellman 1989; Shapiro 2007; Nefdt 2016), and\nforms of mentalism in the guise of intuitionism. For instance, while\nRichard Montague is often attributed with the view that linguistics\ncan be viewed as a branch of mathematics, it is unclear whether or not\nhe endorsed a platonistic ontology. Devitt (2006: 26) describes the\npossibility of a \u2018methodological platonism\u2019 in the\nfollowing manner:\n\n\nIt is often convenient to talk of objects posited by these theories as\nif they were types not tokens, as if they were Platonic objects, but\nthis need be nothing more than a manner of speaking: when the chips\nare down the objects are part of the spatiotemporal physical\nworld.\n\n\nDevitt\u2019s nominalism or \u2018linguistic conception\u2019 was\nnot around at the time of the original Katzian tripartite analysis. He\nargues that linguistics is an empirical science which studies\nlanguages as they are spoken by linguistic communities and viewing\nsentences as \u2018idealised tokens\u2019. Devitt\u2019s\n\u2018linguistic view\u2019 (as opposed to the \u2019psychological\nview\u2019 or Chomskyan mentalism) claims that grammars map onto\nbehavioural output of language production, of which speakers are\ngenerally ignorant.\n\nKatz took nominalism to have been refuted by Chomsky in his critiques\nof American structuralists in the 1960s. But, in Katz\u2019s opinion,\nChomsky had failed to notice that conceptualism was infected with many\nof the same faults as nominalism, because it too localized language\nspatiotemporally (in contingently existing, finite, human brains).\nSince contemporary Minimalist theories share in the earlier\nontological commitment, Katz\u2019 argument would presumably extent\nto them. Through an argument by elimination, Katz concluded that only\nplatonism remained, and must be the correct view to adopt. But this is\na false trichotomy and besides predating Devitt\u2019s more\nphilosophically grounded nominalism, it also fails to take linguistic\npluralism into account.\n\nRecent adherents of pluralism are Stainton (2014) and Santana (2016).\nSantana (2016) argues in favour of a pluralistic ontology for natural\nlanguage based on all of the major foundational approaches, including\nsociolinguistic ontology. His approach is thoroughly naturalistic in\nasking the ontological question through the lens of \u201cwhat sort\nof roles the concept of language plays in linguistic theory and\npractice\u201d (Santana, 2016: 501).\n\nThe first thing Santana does is to separate the discussion into two\nrelated questions, one scientific and the other metascientific or\n\u2018descriptive\u2019 and \u2018normative\u2019 in his terms. He\nclaims that \u201c[l]anguage, the scientific concept, is thus\ndescriptively whatever it is that linguists take as their primary\nobject of study, and normatively whatever it is they should be\nstudying\u201d (Santana, 2016: 501). Eventually he advocates a union\nof various ontologies based on the ineliminable status of each\nperspective (in that way the oppose of Katz\u2019 eliminative\nstrategy).\n\nStainton (2014) similarly proposes a pluralistic ontology but with a\nmore intersectional approach. His additional argument relates to how\nall of the views are indeed compatible. This argument is a response to\nan immediate objection along the lines of Postal (2003, 2009) as to\nthe incompatibility of the various ontologies associated with\nmentalism, Platonism, physicalism and public language views. Stainton\nbegins the pluralist apology in this way.\n\n\nThere is an obvious rebuttal on behalf of pluralism, namely that\n\u201cthe linguistic\u201d is a complex phenomenon with parts that\nbelong to distinct ontological categories. This shouldn\u2019t\nsurprise, since even \u201cthe mathematical\u201d is like this: Two\nwholly physical dogs plus two other wholly physical dogs yields four\ndogs; there certainly is the mental operation of multiplying 26 by 84,\nthe mental state of thinking about the square root of 7, and so on.\n(2014: 5)\n\n\nHis main argument against incompatibility, and in favour of\nintersection, is that the former rests on an equivocation of the terms\n\u2018mental\u2019, \u2018abstract\u2019 and even\n\u2018physical\u2019. Once the equivocation is cleared up, it is\nargued, hybrid ontological objects are licensed. The argument goes\nthat appreciating the nuanced physical and mental and what he calls\n\u2018abstractish\u2019 nature of natural language will dissolve\nworries about ontological inconsistency and open the door for\nintersection. Consider some other members of this category of\nobjects.\n\n\nIndeed, our world is replete with such hybrid objects: psychocultural\nkinds (e.g. dining room tables, footwear, bonfires, people, sport\nfishing [...]; intellectual artifacts (college diplomas,\ndrivers\u2019 licenses, the Canadian dollar [...]; and institutions\n(MIT\u2019s Department of Linguistics and Philosophy, Disneyworld\n[...] (Stainton, 2014: 6).\n\n\nDespite the decline in interest in the ontology of language itself,\nphilosophers have recently embraced a subset of this debate in the\nphilosophy of linguistic objects with a special focus on words. There\nis a recent debate in philosophy on the philosophy of what Rey (2006,\n2020) calls \u2018Standard Linguistic Entities\u2019 (SLEs) or\ntokens of word, sentence, morpheme, and phonemes types. Rey then\ndefines a position called \u2019physical tokenism\u2019 or PT as the\nassumption that SLEs can be identified with physical (acoustic)\nspatio-temporal phenomena. He doesn\u2019t think that SLEs share the\nsame kind of existence as his trusty Honda. In fact he thinks that\nthey are \u2018intentional inexistents\u2019 (borrowed from\nBrentano, see the\n SEP entry\n on \u2018Brentano\u2019s Theory of Judgement, see also the section\nentitled \u2018Intentional Inexistence\u2019 in the\n entry on Intentionality)\n or purely intentional uses of the term \u2018represents\u2019 which\ndenote fictions of a particular sort. Linguistic theory according to\nhim is only committed to the intentional contents of things like\nnouns, verbs, verb phrases etc. where \u201can (intentional) content\nis whatever we understand x to be when we use the idiom\n\u2018represent(ation of) x\u2019 but there is no real x\u201d\n(2006: 242).\n\nThere has been some theoretical work on the nature of entities like\nphrases and words in linguistics. For example, Ross (2010) argues that\nthe concept of parts of speech is fuzzy. Similarly, Szab\u00f3\n(2015) rejects the idea that parts of speech should be identified by\ndistributional analysis as is common in syntax. Instead he offers a\nsemantic approach based on predicate logic where the aim is to model\nthe major lexical categories directly in terms of open class\nconstants. This, he claims, results in a reduction of the gap between\ngrammar and logic. So, for instance, nouns become not types\ncorresponding to distributionally defined syntactic objects but rather\nopen lexical constants used for reference such that the semantic\nclause only needs to involve a universal quantifier and a variable\nspecified in terms of reference. Verbs, on the other hand, are\nconstants which purport to predicate (for more details, see\nSzab\u00f3 2015 and Nefdt 2020). For Haspelmath (2011) a central\nproblem is the concept of wordhood. He identifies ten morphosyntactic\ncriteria for words as the best possible candidates over seemingly\ninferior semantic or phonological options. He shows all of them to be\nwanting, with the result among other things being that \u201cthe\nnotion of lexical integrity is not well supported and should not be\nappealed to in explaining grammatical phenomena\u201d (Haspelmath,\n2011: 33). The very notion of wordhood, although intuitive and\ncentral, is unclear upon further scrutiny. Yet, in linguistics there\nis continual hope for a resolution, that there is something more than\nessential inexistence at stake. Haspelmath thinks this is a vain hope,\nand attributes it to the influence of orthography on the thought of\nlinguist researchers.\n\nPhilosophers have been traditionally interested in the metaphysics of\nSLEs with a special focus on the ontological status of words.\nInterestingly, this literature showcases variations on the\nfoundational debates on the ontology of language. As Miller (2020)\nnotes:\n\n\nWords play various roles in our lives. Some insult, some inspire, and\nwords are central to communication. The aim of an ontology of words is\nto determine what entities, if any, can play those roles and possess\n(or instantiate) these properties. (2)\n\n\nHowever the positions advocated are somewhat more nuanced than the\noriginal Katzian trichotomy suggests. They usually start with the\nproblem of word individuation expressed in the following manner:\n\n\nThink of the following line: A rose is a rose is a rose. How many\nwords are there in this line? If we were to count words themselves,\nnot their instances, the answer is three: rose, is, and a. If we were\nto count the concrete instances we see on a piece of paper, the answer\nis eight. The line, however, can be taken as an abstract type; a\nsequence of shapes. (Irmak, 2019: 1140)\n\n\nFurther complications are introduced by reference to words like\n\u201ccolor\u201d and \u201ccolour\u201d. Here the idea is that\nthe phonological profile of a word is a guide to its identity. But\nthis fails in other cases.\n\n\nNow take the name MOHAMMED. Since Arabic does not notate vowels, the\nname has been transcribed in a wide variety of ways in English, and\nsome of such transcriptions present important discrepancies: For\nexample, \u201cMohammad\u201d and \u201cMehmood.\u201d Even if we\nknow that they originated from the same source, the difference between\nthe two forms is considerable, and intuitions about their being\nvariants of the same name are less clear. What is the point up to\nwhich differences in spelling are consistent with word identity?\n(Gasparri, 2021: 594)\n\n\nWord individuation goes beyond this initial characterisation and it is\nnot always clear how the many accounts deal with the more complex\nquestions directly in their metaphysical pursuits. For instance,\nissues not usually mentioned in the literature, but which seem equally\nimportant are related to whether pitch in \u2018They poured pitch all\nover the parking lot\u2019 and \u2018The players swarmed the pitch\nafter they won the game\u2019 are different words. What about words\nwithin different syntactic categories, such as \u2018watch\u2019\n(time-telling device) and \u2018watch\u2019 (observe)? Are\n\u201cain\u2019t\u201d and \u201cisn\u2019t\u201d and\n\u201caren\u2019t\u201d different words? What about simple cases of\ninflectional morphology such as like \u2018toy\u2019 and\n\u2018toys\u2019? \n\nAccording to Nefdt (2019b), the identity of a word is tied to its role\nin the sentence structure. In which case, \u201cain\u2019t\u201d\nand \u201cisn\u2019t\u201d come out as the same word (at least in\nthe singular use) but \u2018watch\u2019 (noun) and\n\u2018watch\u2019 (verb) do not. However, counterintuitively, his\naccount might license the identity of words like \u2018truck\u2019\nand \u2018lorry\u2019.\n\nThere are two strong but separate traditions which can both lay claim\nto being the \u2018received position\u2019. Within linguistics, the\nidea of a word as a LEXEME or mental dictionary entry is commonplace\n(with stipulations for senses, irregular forms, and selectional\ncriteria). Most introductory textbooks assume something of this sort.\nIn the philosophical literature, on the other hand, a mild or\nmethodological version of platonism is often presupposed. This view\nhas it that words can be separated into types and tokens, where the\nformer lack specific spatiotemporal features and the latter\ninstantiate these forms somehow.\n\nThe latter intuition seems to characterize most views on the ontology\nof words. Bromberger (1989) defines what he calls \u201cthe Platonic\nRelationship Principle\u201d or the principle that allows us to\n\u2018impute properties to types after observing and judging some of\ntheir tokens\u2019 (Bromberger 1989, 62). While Bromberger (1989,\n2011) represents the pinnacle of the classical philosophy of\nlinguistics approach to these questions. In a more metaphysical mode,\nDavid Kaplan (1990, 2011) constructs a thoroughly physicalist proposal\nin which words are modelled in terms of a stages and continuants:\n\n\nI propose a quite different model according to which utterances and\ninscriptions are stages of words, which are the continuants made up of\nthese interpersonal stages along with some more mysterious\nintrapersonal stages. (Kaplan 1990: 98)\n\n\nFor him, what individuates words is the intention of the user (see\nCappelen (1999) for an objection to intentional accounts tout court).\nUnfortunately, fascinating as Kaplan\u2019s proposal is, it does not\nattempt to reflect on linguistic theory directly. In fact, one major\ncriticism of his view, courtesy of Hawthorne and Lepore (2011), is\nthat it fails to account for uninstantiated word-types whose existence\nis guaranteed by derivational morphology, whether or not they\u2019ve\nbeen tokened or baptized in the real world. Other notable accounts are\nWetzel\u2019s (2009) Platonism (see the\n SEP entry on abstract objects)\n and Szab\u00f3\u2019s (1999) representational/nominalist view.\n\nThe philosophy of words has recently seen a resurgence in interest\namong philosophers, especially on the ontological issues. Miller\n(2021), for example, attempts to apply a bundle theory to the task of\nword individuation and identification. Irmak (2019) suggests that\nwords are abstract artifacts (similarly to Katz and Wetzel) but\ninsists that they are more akin to musical scores or works of fiction\nwhich have temporal components (\u201ctemporal abstracta\u201d as he\ncalls it). Mallory (2020) advocates the position that words are not\nreally objects in the ordinary sense. However, he opts for an\naction-theoretic approach in which tokens provide instructions for the\nperformance of action-types where our normal understanding of\n\u2018word\u2019 is to be identified with those types. His view is\novertly naturalistic and focuses on the concept of words which is\ndrawn from contemporary linguistic theory. Similarly, Nefdt (2019b)\nproffers a mathematical structuralist interpretation of SLEs in which\nthe definition of words is continuous with the ontology of phrases and\nsentences. Here he follows Jackendoff (2018) who uses model-theoretic\n(Pullum 2013) or constraint-based grammar formalisms to argue for a\ncontinuum between words and linguistic rules. In other words, these\nlatter two authors reject the idea that words are somehow sui generis\nentities in need of discontinuous explanation. Gasparri (2020)\nsuggests pluralism is a more solid foundation for the ontology of\nwords. He evaluates both \u201cbundlistic\u201d views such as\nMiller\u2019s and causal-historical accounts such as Irmak\u2019s\nbefore offering an alternative \u201cview that there is a plurality\nof epistemically virtuous ways of thinking about the nature of\nwords\u201d (608).\n\nThese are of course complex issues and they offer a lens through which\nto appreciate the erstwhile debate on the ontology of language but\nwith a contemporary and more focused flavor. Not all of the authors\nwho work on the philosophy of words consider the role of linguistic\ntheory to be central. Hence their work might be related but it does\nnot quite qualify as the philosophy of linguistics, where this is\nviewed as a subfield of the philosophy of science. By contrast, we\nhave focused on the authors who directly engage with linguistic theory\nin their accounts of the ontology of SLEs. There is also no clear\nmapping between the various ontological accounts mentioned here and\nthe characterizations of linguistic theorizing in terms of\nExternalism, Emergentism and Essentialism. No particular metaphysical\nview unifies any of our three groupings. For example, not all\nExternalists incline toward nominalism; numerous Emergentists as well\nas most Essentialists take linguistics to be about mental phenomena;\nand our Essentialists include Katz\u2019s platonism alongside the\nChomskyan \u2018I-language\u2019 advocates and pluralists embrace\naspects of all of the above.\n",
