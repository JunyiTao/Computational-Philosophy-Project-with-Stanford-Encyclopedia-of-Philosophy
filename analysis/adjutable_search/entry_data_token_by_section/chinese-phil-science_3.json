Shared Intellectual Contexts\n\n\nThere were important differences between the social and\ninstitutional contexts of early philosophy and science, as well as\nimportant differences between sciences. The authors of\nphilosophical or \u201cMasters\u201d texts (discussed below) were\nprivate individuals who often sought, but rarely achieved political\ninfluence. By contrast, astronomy and calendrics in particular were\nclosely linked to government and court patronage, and from Han times\non, located in the Bureau of Astronomy (Loewe 1994, Pankenier 2013,\nRaphals 2013, Sivin 2009).\n\n\nThe origins of science in China seem to lie in an amalgam of ideas\nfrom both Masters textualists (philosophers) and technical\nspecialists.  According to Sivin (1988 and 1990) the basic Chinese\nsciences were established some time between the first century BCE and\nthe first century CE through what he describes as a combination of Ru\n(\u201cConfucian\u201d) ideas and ideas from technical specialists,\nespecially experts in yin-yang, Five Agents (wu xing) and\ntechnical expertise traditions associated with \u201cNumbers and\nTechniques\u201d (shu shu) and \u201cRecipes and\nMethods\u201d (fang ji, both discussed below.)\n\n\nKey to this amalgam were several concepts shared by both groups but\ndeployed in very different ways. Early cosmological thinking\ndepicts a cosmos ultimately composed of qi \u6c23 (the\nenergy that constitutes and organizes matter and causes growth and\nchange) in processes of constant change, based on the interactions of\nyin and yang \u9670\u967d and the Five Agents (wu xing\n\u4e94\u884c, Graham 1986, Raphals 1998 and 2013).\n\n\nPhilosophers deployed these ideas in (1) the yin-yang cosmology of\nthe Yi jing, (2) theories of correlative correspondence\nbetween Heaven, Earth and Humanity as a shared representation of cosmic\norder, and (3) the idea of a \u201cclassic\u201d or\n\u201ccanon\u201d as the founding text of a textual lineage.\nPractitioners of several sciences also deployed these concepts, in\nparticular in models of the human body and of the movements of the sun,\nmoon and stars.\n\n\nFinally, both groups created textual lineages and accounts of\ntextual authority. In a scientific context, authoritative texts\nwere nominally attributed to a culture hero or divine source. \nExamples include the medical \u201cclassic\u201d The Yellow\nEmperor's Classic of Internal Medicine (Huang Di nei\njing, Unschuld 2003, Unschuld and Tessenow 2011) and the Zhou\n[dynasty] Classic of Gnomon Calculation (Zhou bi suan\njing, Cullen 1976 and 1996). By contrast, the evidence of\nrecently excavated texts indicates that such texts derived from prior\ntextual traditions that were subsequently lost (Harper 1998). Other\nMasters created their own texts and apocryphal lineages, but did not\nappear to have debated each other extensively or to have taken\nself-consciously critical stances toward their human or textual\npredecessors (Lloyd 1996, Lloyd and Sivin 2002).\n",
