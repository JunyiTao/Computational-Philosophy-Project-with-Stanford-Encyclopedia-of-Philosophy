As was argued in\n section 3.3,\n even if they are weak, the presence of positive desert makes a\ndifference to the justification of punishment. It might affect, for\nexample, how one understands the forfeiture of the right not\nto be punished. It is a separate question, however, whether positive\ndesert carries much weight in establishing an all-things-considered\nreason to punish.\n\nTo be more precise, there are actually two ways the strength or\nweakness of retributive reasons can be significant. It may affect\nwhether an individual wrongdoer should be punished, even if no\ninstrumental good (primarily deterrence and incapacitation) would\nthereby be achieved, assuming that the institutions for punishment are\nin place. But it may also affect whether institutions of punishment\nshould be established, even if no instrumental goods would thereby be\nachieved. It may be relatively easy to justify punishing a wrongdoer\nby appeal to positive desert, even if her punishment yields no\ninstrumental benefits, if the institutions of punishment are already\nup, running, and paid for (Moore 1997: 100\u2013101; Husak 2000:\n995). It is another matter to claim that the institutions of\npunishment, given all their costs, can be justified by positive desert\nalone. The point of saying this is not to suggest, in the spirit of\nHart (1968: 9) that the justification of institutions of criminal\njustice should be purely consequentialist. The retributivist sees\ndesert as a reason for setting up the institutions as well as for\npunishing the individual wrongdoer (Moore 1997: 154). The point is\nmerely that one should be clear about just what one is assessing when\nweighing costs and benefits.\n\nThe primary costs of establishing the institutions of criminal\npunishment are:\n\nFinancial: (according the U.S. Bureau of Justice Statistics,\nstates spent over $51 billion on corrections in 2015) with\ncorresponding opportunity costs (that money could have been spent on\nschools, medical research, infrastructure, or taxpayer refunds, to\nname only a few alternatives);\nErrors (convicting the innocent, over-punishing the guilty, and\npunishing those who deserve no punishment under laws that\novercriminalize);\nThe risk of the abuse of power (political and other forms of\noppressive uses of the criminal justice system); and\nCollateral harm to innocents (e.g., the families of convicts who\nlose the support from those who are punished). (See Husak 2000 for the\nfirst three.)\n\n\nIt is implausible that these costs can be justified simply by the\nimportance of punishing wrongdoers as they deserve to be punished. The\nonly plausible way to justify these costs is if criminal punishment\nhas large instrumental benefits in terms of crime prevention (Husak\n2000; Cahill 2011; Lippke 2019).\n",
