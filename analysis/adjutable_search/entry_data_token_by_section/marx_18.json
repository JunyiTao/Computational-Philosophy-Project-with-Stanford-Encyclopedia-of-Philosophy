On reading\nMarx\u2019s works at all periods of his life, there appears to be the\nstrongest possible distaste towards bourgeois capitalist society, and\nan undoubted endorsement of future communist society. Yet the terms of\nthis antipathy and endorsement are far from clear. Despite\nexpectations, Marx never directly says that capitalism is unjust.\nNeither does he directly say that communism would be a just form of\nsociety. In fact he frequently takes pains to distance himself from\nthose who engage in a discourse of justice, and makes a conscious\nattempt to exclude direct moral commentary in his own works. The\npuzzle is why this should be, given the weight of indirect moral\ncommentary one also finds in his writings.\n\nThere are, initially, separate questions concerning Marx\u2019s\nattitude to capitalism and to communism. There are also separate\nquestions concerning his attitude to ideas of justice, and to ideas of\nmorality more broadly concerned. This, then, generates four questions:\n(a) Did Marx think capitalism unjust?; (b) did he think that\ncapitalism could be morally criticised on other grounds?; (c) did he\nthink that communism would be just? (d) did he think it could be\nmorally approved of on other grounds? These are some of the questions\nwe consider in this section.\n",
