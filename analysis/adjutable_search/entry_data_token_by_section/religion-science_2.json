    "main_text": "Science, religion, and how they interrelate || Taxonomies of the interaction between science and religion\n1.3 Taxonomies of the interaction between science and religion\n\nSeveral typologies probe the interaction between science and religion.\nFor example, Mikael Stenmark (2004) distinguishes between three views:\nthe independence view (no overlap between science and religion), the\ncontact view (some overlap between the fields), and a union of the\ndomains of science and religion; within these views he recognizes\nfurther subdivisions, e.g., contact can be in the form of conflict or\nharmony. The most influential taxonomy of the relationship between\nscience and religion remains Barbour\u2019s (2000): conflict,\nindependence, dialogue, and integration. Subsequent authors, as well\nas Barbour himself, have refined and amended this taxonomy. However,\nothers (e.g., Cantor & Kenny 2001) have argued that this taxonomy\nis not useful to understand past interactions between both fields.\nNevertheless, because of its enduring influence, it is still\nworthwhile to discuss it in detail.\n\nThe conflict model holds that science and religion are in\nperpetual and principal conflict. It relies heavily on two historical\nnarratives: the trial of Galileo (see Dawes 2016) and the reception of\nDarwinism (see Bowler 2001). Contrary to common conception, the\nconflict model did not originate in two seminal publications,\nnamely John Draper\u2019s (1874) History of the Conflict between\nReligion and Science and Andrew Dickson White\u2019s (1896)\ntwo-volume opus A History of the Warfare of Science with Theology\nin Christendom. Rather, as James Ungureanu (2019) argues, the\nproject of these early architects of the conflict thesis needs to be\ncontextualized in a liberal Protestant tradition of attempting to\nseparate religion from theology, and thus salvage religion. Their work\nwas later appropriated by skeptics and atheists who used their\narguments about the incompatibility of traditional theological views\nwith science to argue for secularization, something Draper and White\ndid not envisage.\n\nThe vast majority of authors in the science and religion field is\ncritical of the conflict model and believes it is based on a shallow\nand partisan reading of the historical record. While the conflict\nmodel is at present a minority position, some have used philosophical\nargumentation (e.g., Philipse 2012) or have carefully re-examined\nhistorical evidence such as the Galileo trial (e.g., Dawes 2016) to\nargue for this model. Alvin Plantinga (2011) has argued that the\nconflict is not between science and religion, but between science and\nnaturalism. In his Evolutionary Argument Against Naturalism (first\nformulated in 1993), Plantinga argues that naturalism is epistemically\nself-defeating: if both naturalism and evolution are true, then\nit\u2019s unlikely we would have reliable cognitive faculties.\n\nThe independence model holds that science and religion\nexplore separate domains that ask distinct questions. Stephen Jay\nGould developed an influential independence model with his NOMA\nprinciple (\u201cNon-Overlapping Magisteria\u201d):\n\n\nThe lack of conflict between science and religion arises from a lack\nof overlap between their respective domains of professional expertise.\n(2001: 739)\n\n\nHe identified science\u2019s areas of expertise as empirical\nquestions about the constitution of the universe, and religion\u2019s\ndomain of expertise as ethical values and spiritual meaning. NOMA is\nboth descriptive and normative: religious leaders should refrain from\nmaking factual claims about, for instance, evolutionary theory, just\nas scientists should not claim insight on moral matters. Gould held\nthat there might be interactions at the borders of each magisterium,\nsuch as our responsibility toward other living things. One obvious\nproblem with the independence model is that if religion were barred\nfrom making any statement of fact, it would be difficult to justify\nits claims of value and ethics. For example, one could not argue that\none should love one\u2019s neighbor because it pleases the creator\n(Worrall 2004). Moreover, religions do seem to make empirical claims,\nfor example, that Jesus appeared after his death or that the early\nHebrews passed through the parted waters of the Red Sea.\n\nThe dialogue model proposes a mutualistic relationship\nbetween religion and science. Unlike independence, it assumes a common\nground between both fields, perhaps in their presuppositions, methods,\nand concepts. For example, the Christian doctrine of creation may have\nencouraged science by assuming that creation (being the product of a\ndesigner) is both intelligible and orderly, so one can expect there\nare laws that can be discovered. Creation, as a product of God\u2019s\nfree actions, is also contingent, so the laws of nature cannot be\nlearned through a priori thinking which prompts the need for\nempirical investigation. According to Barbour (2000), both scientific\nand theological inquiry are theory-dependent, or at least\nmodel-dependent. For example, the doctrine of the Trinity colors how\nChristian theologians interpret the first chapters of Genesis. Next\nto this, both rely on metaphors and models. Both fields remain\nseparate but they talk to each other, using common methods, concepts,\nand presuppositions. Wentzel van Huyssteen (1998) has argued for a\ndialogue position, proposing that science and religion can be in a\ngraceful duet, based on their epistemological overlaps. The Partially\nOverlapping Magisteria (POMA) model defended by Alister McGrath (e.g.,\nMcGrath and Collicutt McGrath 2007) is also worth mentioning.\nAccording to McGrath, science and religion each draw on several\ndifferent methodologies and approaches. These methods and approaches\nare different ways of knowing that have been shaped through historical\nfactors. It is beneficial for scientists and theologians to be in\ndialogue with each other.\n\nThe integration model is more extensive in its unification of\nscience and theology. Barbour (2000) identifies three forms of\nintegration. First, natural theology, which formulates arguments for\nthe existence and attributes of God. It uses interpretations of\nresults from the natural sciences as premises in its arguments. For\ninstance, the supposition that the universe has a temporal origin\nfeatures in contemporary cosmological arguments for the existence of\nGod. Likewise, the fact that the cosmological constants and laws of\nnature are life-permitting (whereas many other combinations of\nconstants and laws would not permit life) is used in contemporary\nfine-tuning arguments (see the entry to\n fine-tuning arguments).\n Second, theology of nature starts not from science but from a\nreligious framework, and examines how this can enrich or even revise\nfindings of the sciences. For example, McGrath (2016) developed a\nChristian theology of nature, examining how nature and scientific\nfindings can be interpreted through a Christian lens. Thirdly, Barbour\nbelieved that Whitehead\u2019s process philosophy was a promising way\nto integrate science and religion.\n\nWhile integration seems attractive (especially to theologians), it is\ndifficult to do justice to both the scientific and religious aspects\nof a given domain, especially given their complexities. For example,\nPierre Teilhard de Chardin (1971), who was both knowledgeable in\npaleoanthropology and theology, ended up with an unconventional view\nof evolution as teleological (which put him at odds with the\nscientific establishment) and with an unorthodox theology (which\ndenied original sin and led to a series of condemnations by the Roman\nCatholic Church). Theological heterodoxy, by itself, is no reason to\ndoubt a model. However, it shows obstacles for the integration model\nto become a live option in the broader community of theologians and\nphilosophers who want to remain affiliate to a specific religious\ncommunity without transgressing its boundaries. Moreover, integration\nseems skewed towards theism: Barbour described arguments based on\nscientific results that support (but do not demonstrate) theism, but\nfailed to discuss arguments based on scientific results that support\n(but do not demonstrate) the denial of theism. Hybrid positions like\nMcGrath\u2019s POMA indicate some difficulty for Barbour\u2019s\ntaxonomy: the scope of conflict, independence, dialogue, and\nintegration is not clearly defined and they are not mutually\nexclusive. For example, if conflict is defined broadly then it is\ncompatible with integration. Take the case of Frederick Tennant\n(1902), who sought to explain sin as the result of evolutionary\npressures on human ancestors. This view led him to reject the Fall as\na historical event, as it was not compatible with evolutionary\nbiology. His view has conflict (as he saw Christian doctrine in\nconflict with evolutionary biology) but also integration (he sought to\nintegrate the theological concept of sin in an evolutionary picture).\nIt is clear that many positions defined by authors in the religion and\nscience literature do not clearly fall within one of Barbour\u2019s\nfour domains.\n",
