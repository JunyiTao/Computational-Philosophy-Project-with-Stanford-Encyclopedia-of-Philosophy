Informal Logic Within A Broader Context\n\nInformal logic\u2019s attempt to understand argument as it occurs in\na broad range of real life situations continues to evolve in a way\nthat is influenced by the study of real life reasoning that takes\nplace within the broader scope of argumentation theory. \n\nOne cognate field of note is Artificial Intelligence (AI). It relies\non step by step accounts of informal reasoning in a wide array of\ncontexts. Informal logics provide this in a general way that has\ninfluenced the attempt to model argumentation between agents in\nmulti-agent systems which mimic or assist human reasoning.\nComputational models have been applied to large-scale collections\n(\u2018webs\u2019) of inter-connected arguments, and to reasoning\nabout medical decisions, legal issues, chemical properties and other\ncomplex systems. Automated argument assistance functions as a\ncomputational aid that can assist in the construction of an argument.\nVerheij 2014 provides an overview of the issues that this raises. \n\nThe development in the empirical study of real life reasoning is the\nstudy of argument \u201ccorpora\u201d \u2014 large collections of\nargument drawn from natural language discourse. In an early study of\nthis sort, Jorgenson, Kock and Rorbech 1991 analyzed a series of 37\none-hour televised debates from Danish public TV. The debates featured\nwell-known public figures arguing for and against policy proposals. A\nrepresentative audience of 100 voters voted before and after the\ndebate. Their conclusions were compared with standard notions of\n\u201cproper\u201d and \u201cvalid\u201d argumentation. Other\nstudies consider corpora made up of large databases of selected\nwritten texts (see, e.g., Goodwin and Cortes 2010, and Mochales and\nIeven 2009). \n\nArgument mining is a subfield of data mining, or text mining (and\ncomputational linguistics). It uses software and algorithms that\nautomatically process texts looking for argument structures \u2014\nfor premises, conclusions, argumentation schemes, and extended webs of\nargument. The texts studied include legal documents , on-line debates,\nproduct reviews, academic literature, user comments on proposed\nregulations, newspaper articles and court cases, as well as dialogical\ndomains.\n ARG-tech,\n the Centre for Argument Technology, has played a central role in\nstudies of this sort. \n\nOther research relevant to informal logic has highlighted many ways in\nwhich the success of real life arguments depends on aspects of\nargumentation which are not well integrated into standard systems of\ninformal logic. The latter include an arguer\u2019s ability to draw\nattention to their argument (using \u201cargument flags\u201d that\nattract the attention of an intended audience); their personal\ncredibility, ethos, or standing; or their ability to situate\ntheir argument within a broader context of debate or dialogue. The\nstudy of these and other pragmatic, social, dialectical, semiotic and\nrhetorical features of arguing will probably play a role in the\ncontinued development of informal logic. \n\nThe expansion of informal logic to account for an ever broader range\nof argument is evident in discussions of the use of narratives within\nargument. In Plato\u2019s Republic, Glaucon uses the\nmythical story of \u201cThe Ring of Gyges\u201d to prove that humans\nare inherently selfish. In this and many other situations, stories of\nvarious kinds (accounts of some historical event, biographies, fables,\nparables, morality plays, etc) are designed to provide support for\nsome conclusion. It is often been said that a novel or some other work\nof fiction is an argument for socialism, freedom of expression, or\nsome other value. \n\nOne can understand the argumentative use of narratives in a variety of\nways: as rhetorical embellishment, as a form of argument by analogy,\nas implicit generalization (the characters in a story functioning as\nvariables within such generalizations), or reasoning that requires the\ndevelopment of unique standards of argument assessment. According to\nFisher 1987, argument itself is best understood as narrative.\nAccording to Nussbaum 1990, literature is a way to better understand,\nand argue about, complex moral situations. Within informal logic,\nWalton, Reed, and Macagno 2008 identify narrative-based schemes of\nargument while others continue to debate the role that narratives play\nin ordinary argument (see Govier and Ayer 2013, Olmos 2014, Plumer\n2015). \n\nInformal logic\u2019s interest in real life argument has, from the\nstart, been tied to its interest in the teaching of reasoning\nskills. In view of this, its interests overlap with fields and\ndisciplines that study education and pedagogy \u2014 links manifest\nin its own influence on critical thinking and the philosophy of\neducation (and movements like \u201cPhilosophy for Children\u201d).\n\n\nSome of the educational issues raised by informal logic are manifest\nin the development of critical thinking tests which attempt to measure\nargumentation skills. They are used to test the abilities of students\nor others and, in a self-reflective way, as an empirical way to test\nthe success of attempts to teach informal reasoning.\n\nCritical thinking (or, even more so, creative thinking) skills are not\neasily assessed using standardized tests which are designed for large\nscale use, and typically rely on multiple choice question and answers\n(see Sobocan 2021). In real life contexts, what counts as good arguing\n(and thinking) is open ended and unpredictable, dialectical, and\ninfluenced by pragmatic and contextual considerations which are\ndifficult to incorporate within standard tests. The California\nCritical Thinking Test reflects the view of critical thinking\nelaborated in \u201cThe Delphi Report,\u201d commissioned by the\nAmerican Philosophical Association in 1987, a report that focuses on a\nnarrow range of critical thinking skills which tends to oversimplify\nthe competencies required for good informal argument. \n\nEnnis 2013 provides a comprehensive proposal for dealing with the\nissues raised by critical thinking tests, and with other challenges\nraised by attempts to teach critical thinking. \n",
