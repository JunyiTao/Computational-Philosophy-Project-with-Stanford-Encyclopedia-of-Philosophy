    "main_text": "\n\nThe Chan School (Chan zong, \u79aa\u5b97) is an\nindigenous form of Chinese Buddhism that developed beginning in the\nsixth century CE and subsequently spread to the rest of East Asia\n(Japanese: Zen; Korean: S\u00f4n; Vietnamese; Thi\u1ec1n). Although\nthe Sinograph \u201cchan\u201d (\u79aa) transliterates the\nSanskrit dhy\u0101na or \u201cmeditation\u201d, and\nChan zong can thus be translated as the \u201cMeditation\nSchool\u201d, Chan was not distinctive within Chinese Buddhism in its\nuse of meditative techniques. What distinguished Chan were its novel\nuse of language, its development of new narrative forms, and its\nvalorization of the direct and embodied realization of Buddhist\nawakening. In contrast with the epistemic, hermeneutical and\nmetaphysical concerns that shaped other schools of Chinese Buddhism,\nChan\u2019s defining concerns were experiential and\nrelational\u2014concerns that fit most comfortably, perhaps, within\nthe horizons of philosophical anthropology. Appreciating the\nphilosophical dimensions of Chan thus requires some familiarity with\nBuddhist thought and practice, and the dynamics of their infusion into\nChinese culture.\n",
