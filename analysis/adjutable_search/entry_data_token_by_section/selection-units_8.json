    "main_text": "An Anatomy of the Debates || Species Selection\n3.2 Species Selection\n\nAmbiguities about the definition of a unit of selection have also\nsnarled the debate about selection processes at the species level. One\nresponse to the notion of species selection comes with a classic\nconfusion: \u201cIt is individual selection discriminating against\nthe individuals of the losing species that causes the\nextinction\u201d (Mayr 1997: 2093). The individual death of species\nmembers is confused with extinction: \u201cthe actual selection takes\nplace at the level of competing individuals of the two species\u201d\n(Mayr 1997: 2093). Once we overcome such difficulties, and succeed in\nconceiving of species as unified interactors, we are still faced with\ntwo questions. The combining of the interactor question and the\nmanifestor-of-adaptation question (in the engineering sense) led to\nthe rejection of research aimed at considering the role of species as\ninteractors, simpliciter, in evolution. Once it is understood\nthat species-level interactors may or may not possess design-type\nadaptations, it becomes possible to distinguish two research\nquestions: Do species function as interactors, playing an active and\nsignificant role in evolution by selection? And does the evolution of\nspecies-level interactors produce species-level engineering\nadaptations and, if so, how often?\n\nFor the early history of the species selection debate, these questions\nwere lumped together; asking whether species could be units of\nselection meant asking whether they fulfilled both the\ninteractor and manifestor-of-adaptation roles. For example, early\nspecies selection advocates used a genic selectionist treatment of the\nevolution of altruism as a touchstone in the definition of species\nselection (e.g., Vrba 1984). The relevant argument is that kin\nselection could cause the spread of altruistic genes but that it\nshould not be called group selection (Maynard Smith 1976). Again, this\nwas because the groups were not considered to possess design-type\nadaptations themselves. Some species selectionists agreed that the\nspread of altruism should not be considered a case of group selection\nbecause \u201cthere is no group adaptation involved; altruism is not\nemergent at the group level\u201d (Vrba 1984: 319; Maynard Smith\ngives different reasons for his rejection). This amounts to assuming\nthat there must be group benefit in the sense of a design-type\ngroup-level adaptation in order to say that group selection can occur.\nThis species selection view was that evolution by selection is not\nhappening at a given level unless there is a benefit or engineering\nadaptation at that level. The early species selection position\nexplicitly equates units of selection with the existence of an\ninteractor plus adaptation at that level (Vrba 1983: 388);\nfurthermore, it seems that the stronger, engineering definition of\nadaptation had been adopted.\n\nIt was generally accepted among early species selectionists that\nspecies selection does not happen unless there are species-level\nadaptations (Eldredge 1985: 196, 134). Certain cases are rejected as\nhigher-level selection processes overall because \n\n\nfrequencies of the properties of lower-level individuals which are\npart of a high-level individual simply do not make convincing\nhigher-level adaptations. (Eldredge 1985: 133)\n\n\nMost of those defending species selection early on defined a unit of\nselection as requiring an emergent, adaptive property (Vrba 1983,\n1984; Vrba and Eldredge 1984; Vrba and Gould 1986). This amounts to\nasking a combination of the interactor and manifestor-of-adaptation\nquestions. But the relevant question is not \u201cwhether some\nparticle-level causal processes or other bear the causal\nresponsibility,\u201d but rather \u201cwhether particle-level\nselection bears the causal responsibility\u201d (Okasha\n2006: 107). An emergent character requirement conflates these two\nquestions. Such a character may be the result of a selection process\nat the group/species level, but it should not be treated as a\npre-condition of such a process.\n\nBut consider the lineage-wide trait of variability. Treating species\nas interactors has a long tradition (Dobzhansky 1956, Thoday 1953,\nLewontin 1958). If species are conceived as interactors (and not\nnecessarily manifestors of adaptations), then the notion of species\nselection is not vulnerable to the original anti group-selection\nobjections from the early genic selectionists (Williams\n 1966).[12]\n The old idea was that lineages with certain properties of being able\nto respond to environmental stresses would be selected for, and thus\nthat the trait of variability itself would be selected for and would\nspread in the population of populations. In other words, lineages were\ntreated as interactors. The earlier researchers spoke loosely of\nadaptations where adaptations were treated in the weak sense as\nequivalent simply to the outcome of selection processes (at any\nlevel). They were explicitly not concerned with the effect of\nspecies selection on organismic level traits but with the effect on\nspecies-level characters such as speciation rates, lineage-level\nsurvival, and extinction rates of species. Some argued, including the\npresent author, that this sort of case represents a perfectly good\nform of species selection, using so-called \u201cemergent\nfitnesses,\u201d even though some balk at the thought that\nvariability would then be considered, under a weak definition, a\nspecies-level adaptation (Lloyd & Gould 1993; Lloyd 1988 [1994]).\nPaleontologists used this approach to species selection in their\nresearch on fossil gastropods (Jablonski 2008, 1987; Jablonski & Hunt 2006), and the approach has also been used in\nthe leading text on speciation (Coyne & Orr 2004).\n\nEarly species selectionists also eventually recognized the advantages\nof keeping the interactor question separate from a requirement for an\nengineering-type adaptation, dropping the former requirement that, in\norder for species to be units of selection, they must possess\nspecies-level adaptations (Vrba 1989). Ultimately, the current\nwidely-accepted definition of species selection is in conformity with\na simple interactor interpretation of a unit of selection (Vrba 1989;\nsee Damuth & Heisler 1988; Lloyd 1988 [1994]; Jablonski 2008).\n\nIt is easy to see how the two-pronged definition of a unit of\nselection\u2014as interactor and manifestor of adaptation\u2014held\nsway for so long in the species selection debates. After all, it had\ndominated much of the group selection debates for so long. Some of the\nconfusion and conflict over higher-level units of selection arose\nbecause of an historical contingency\u2014the early group\nselectionist\u2019s implicit definition of a unit of selection and\nthe responses it provoked (Wynne Edwards 1962; Borrello 2010).\n",
