    "main_text": "The requirement of informed consent\n1. The requirement of informed consent\n\nIn English, \u201cconsent\u201d has several meanings. In the\nrelevant sense, consent transactions have a distinct structure: agent\nA consents to B\u2019s \u03c6\u00ad-ing on\nA, under a certain description of \u03c6\u00ad-ing,\nwhether or not the offer was initiated by B. For example, a\nman may consent to a physician\u2019s touching the man\u2019s\ntesticles as part of a testicular cancer exam upon the\nphysician\u2019s suggestion (compare Kleinig 2010, 6\u20137).\n\nInformed consent is shorthand for informed, voluntary, and\n decisionally-capacitated\n consent. Consent is considered fully informed when a capacitated (or\n\u201ccompetent\u201d) patient or research participant to whom full\ndisclosures have been made and who understands fully all that has been\ndisclosed consents voluntarily to treatment or participation on this\nbasis.\n\nIn its most important role in bioethics, informed consent is a\nlegitimacy requirement for certain actions. Inadequately informed\nconsent makes certain intrusions impermissible. Roughly, when a\nsufficiently capacitated adult does not give sufficiently informed and\nvoluntary consent to intervention in her body or her private sphere,\nthen, at least when the intervention is substantial, not trivial, and\nabsent severe jeopardy for third parties, the intervention is\nimpermissible\u2014even when it seeks to assist her, physicians\nrecommend it, third parties would benefit from it, and the patient\nherself had repeatedly consented to it before expressing a change of\nmind. When the antecedent is inapplicable\u2014for instance, when the\npatient lacks decision-making capacity\u2014similarly spirited rules\napply, such as rules delegating consent \u201cauthority\u201d to the\npatient\u2019s\n advance directive\n or proxy.\n\nWhile consent and informed consent are relevant to medical torts, to\ndistributive and proprietary medical claims, and to ideal (as opposed\nto merely legitimate) doctor-patient relationships, this entry focuses\non informed consent in its central role as a legitimacy requirement\nfor medical intervention. Contemporary medical culture and central\nhuman rights documents support something like this requirement. In the\nU.S., where regulatory commitment to informed consent is especially\nstrong, federal funding for research usually requires review of\ninformed consent procedures, and the constitutional right to privacy\nbinds government to honor patients\u2019 refusal of care. Lack of\ninformed consent can be used to establish negligence (and hence\nmalpractice and torts), or battery and assault.\n\nSince the 1970s, extensive bioethics writing focuses on how to define\nand achieve \u201cvalid\u201d consent\u2014sufficiently\ncapacitated, informed, and voluntary consent\u2014and the conditions,\nespecially in medical research, have become increasingly demanding.\nThe contrast between these post-informed consent expectations and an\nearlier medical ethos is vivid in an excerpt of the Hippocratic Oath\n(fifth century B.C.E.): \u201cConceal most things from the\npatient\u2026 Give necessary orders with cheerfulness and\nserenity\u2026 revealing nothing of the patient\u2019s future or\npresent condition.\u201d Present-day physicians like to think that\nthey treat their patients differently.\n\nSection 2 discusses the potential justifications for the requirement\nof informed consent. Sections 3\u20135 delineate its content with\ngreater detail. Sections 6\u20137 note potential waivers and\nexceptions to the requirement. Sections 8\u20139 review its status\nand its relations to consent requirements in other normative fields.\nSection 10 concludes.\n",
