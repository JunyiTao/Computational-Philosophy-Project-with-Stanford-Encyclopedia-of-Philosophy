According to one (now termed\n\u201cepistemic\u201d) form of \u201cstructural realism\u201d,\nwhatever the intrinsic character or nature of the physical world, only\nits structure can be known, a structure of causal or other modal\nrelations between events or other entities governed by the equations\nof the theory. The gist of this version of structural realism was\nfirst clearly articulated by Russell in his Tarner Lectures at Trinity\nCollege, Cambridge in 1926. As Russell admits, it was the general\ntheory of relativity, particularly in the formulation given within\nEddington\u2019s world geometry, that led him to structuralism\nregarding cognition of physical reality (Russell 1927: 395). Russell,\nhowever, rested the epistemic limitation to knowledge of the structure\nof the physical world on the causal theory of perception. As such,\nstructural features of relations between events not present in the\npercepts of these events could only be inferred according to general\nlaws; hence, posits of unobserved structural features of the world are\nconstrained by exigencies of inductive inference. Moreover,\nRussell\u2019s structural realism quickly fell victim to a rather\nobvious objection lodged by the mathematical Max Newman (see entry on\n structural realism).\n\nIn its contemporary form, structural realism has both an epistemic and\nan \u201contic\u201d form, the latter holding essentially that\ncurrent physical theories warrant that the structural features of the\nphysical world alone are ontologically fundamental (Ladyman & Ross\n2007). Both versions of structural realism subscribe to a view of\ntheory change whereby the sole ontological continuity across changes\nin fundamental physical theory is continuity of structure, as in\ninstances where the equations of an earlier theory can be derived, say\nas limiting cases, from those of the later. Geometrical unification\ntheories seems tailored for this kind of realism. For if a geometrical\ntheory is taken to give a true or approximately true representation of\nthe physical world, it provides definite structure to relations\nposited as fundamental and presumably preserved in any subsequent\ngeometrical generalization. It is therefore instructive to recall that\nfor both Weyl and Eddington geometrical unification was not, nor could\nbe, such a representation, for essentially the reasons articulated two\ndecades before by Poincar\u00e9:\n\n\nDoes the harmony the human intelligence thinks it discovers in nature\nexist outside of this intelligence? No, beyond doubt, a reality\ncompletely independent of the mind which conceives it, sees or feels\nit, is an impossibility. A world as exterior as that, even if it\nexisted, would for us be forever inaccessible. But what we call\nobjective reality is, in the last analysis, what is common to many\nthinking beings, and could be common to all; this common\npart,\u2026, can only be the harmony expressed by mathematical laws.\nIt is this harmony then which is the sole objective reality\u2026.\n(1906: 14)\n\n\nIn Weyl and Eddington, geometrical unification was an attempt to cast\nthe harmony of the Einstein theory of gravitation in a new\nepistemological and so, explanatory, light, by displaying the field\nlaws of gravitation and electromagnetism within the common frame of a\ngeometrically represented observer-independent reality. Their\nunorthodox manner of philosophical argument, cloaked, perhaps\nnecessarily, in the language of differential geometry, has tended to\nconceal or obscure conclusions about the significance of a geometrized\nphysics that push in considerably different directions from either\ninstrumentalism or scientific realism.\n",
