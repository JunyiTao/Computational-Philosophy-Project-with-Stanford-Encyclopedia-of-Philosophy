    "main_text": "Dreaming and theories of consciousness || Beyond dreams: Dreamless sleep experience and the concepts of sleep, waking, and consciousness\n3.3 Beyond dreams: Dreamless sleep experience and the concepts of sleep, waking, and consciousness\n\nPhilosophers have focused almost exclusively on dreaming, largely\nleaving to the side questions about dreamless sleep including whether\nit is uniformly unconscious. In recent years there has been a surge of\ninterest in the possibility of dreamless sleep experience and\nfoundational issues about the definition of sleep and waking. This has\nbeen paralleled by growing interest in dreaming in NREM sleep.\n\nConceptually, interest in dreamless sleep experience has been\nfacilitated by the precise definition of dreaming offered by\nsimulation views (Revonsuo et al. 2015). If dreams are immersive sleep\nexperiences characterized by their here-and-now\nstructure, it makes sense to ask whether this is true for all or just\na subset of sleep-related experiences and whether non-immersive sleep\nexperiences exist. By contrast, if dreaming is broadly identified with\nany conscious mentation in sleep (Pagel et al. 2001), there is no\nconceptual space for dreamless sleep experience.\n\nFollowing Thompson's (2014, 2015) discussion of dreamless sleep in\nIndian and Buddhist philosophy, Windt and colleagues (2016; see also\nWindt 2015b) introduce a framework for different kinds of dreamless\nsleep experience ranging from thinking and isolated imagery,\nperception, or bodily sensations, where these lack integration into a\nscene, to minimal kinds of experience lacking imagery or specific\nthought contents. A possible example of minimal phenomenal experience\nin sleep are white dreams, where people report having had experiences\nduring sleep but cannot remember any details. Taken at face value,\nsome white dream reports might describe experiences that lack\nreportable content (Windt 2015b); others might describe forgotten\ndreams or dreams with degraded content (Fazekas et al. 2018). Another\nexample are reports of witnessing dreamless sleep, as described in\ncertain meditation practices. This state is said to involve\nnon-conceptual awareness of sleep, again in the absence of imagery or\nspecific thought contents, and loss of sense of self (Thompson 2014,\n2015). Some schools in Buddhist philosophy explain claims of deep and\ndreamless sleep by saying we never fully lose consciousness in sleep\n(Prasad 2000, 66; and Thompson 2014, 2015).\n\nEmpirically, interest in dreamless sleep experience is paralleled by\nincreasing interest in experiences in NREM sleep (Fazekas et al.\n2018). Most researchers now accept that dreaming is not confined to\nREM sleep, but also occurs at sleep onset and in NREM sleep. The\ndeeper stages of NREM sleep are particularly interesting as they\ninvolve roughly similar proportions of dreaming, unconscious sleep,\nand white dreams (Noreika et al. 2009: Siclari et al. 2013, 2017). In\nthe search for the neural correlates of dreaming vs unconscious\ndreamless sleep, this makes comparisons within the same sleep stage\npossible and avoids confounds involved in comparing presumably\ndreamful REM sleep with presumably dreamless NREM sleep. Findings\nsuggest that activity in the same parietal hot zone underlies dreaming\nin both NREM and REM sleep (Siclari et al. 2017).\n\nWhere sleep and dream research have traditionally tried to identify\nthe sleep stage correlates of dreaming, newer research suggests local\nchanges occurring independently of sleep stages might in fact be more\nrelevant. Traditionally regarded as global, whole-brain phenomena,\nthere is now increasing evidence that sleep itself is locally driven,\nand local changes in sleep depth might be associated with changes in\nsleep-related experience (Siclari & Tononi 2017; Andrillon et al.\n2019). While sleep and dream research are often considered as separate\nfields, changes in how sleep in general and sleep stages in particular\nare defined appear closely associated with changes in the theoretical\nconception of dreaming and its empirical investigation.\n\nHistorically, discoveries about dreaming have precipitated changing\nconceptions of sleep (for an excellent history of the study of sleep\nand dreaming, see Kroker 2007). Following Aristotle (On Sleeping\nand Waking), sleep was traditionally defined in negative terms as\nthe absence of wakefulness and perception. This is still reflected in\nMalcolm\u2019s assumption that \u201cto a person who is sound\nasleep, \u2018dead to the world\u2019, things cannot even\nseem\u201d (Malcolm 1956: 26).  With the discovery of REM sleep,\nsleep came to be regarded as a heterogeneous phenomenon characterized\nby the cyclic alteration of different sleep stages. REM sleep was now\nconsidered as \u201cneither sleeping nor waking. It was obviously a\nthird state of the brain, as different from sleep as sleep is\nfrom wakefulness\u201d (Jouvet 1999: 5). The folk-psychological\ndichotomy between sleep and wakefulness now seemed oversimplified and\nempirically implausible. At the same time dreaming, which had\npreviously been considered as an intermediate state of half-sleeping\nand half-waking, came to be regarded as a genuine sleep phenomenon,\nbut narrowed to REM sleep.  Today, the framework for describing dreams\nand other sleep-related experiences is more precise, but dreaming has\nalso been cast adrift from REM sleep.\n\nA closely associated issue is how to define waking. Crowther\u2019s\n(2018) capacitation thesis casts waking consciousness as a state in\nwhich the individual is fully switched on to their environment, but\nalso to their own epistemic (cf. O\u2019Shaugnessy 2002) and agentive\npotential; the waking individual is empowered to act and think in\ncertain ways, though this potential need not be actualized. By\ncontrast, dreaming is an \u201cimagining-of consciousness\u201d\n(O\u2019Shaughnessy 2002: 430) and consciousness is conceptually tied\nto wakefulness. Because in lucid dreams, the epistemic and agentive\nprofile of waking is at least partly realized, they might, according\nto Crowther, be regarded as closer to waking than nonlucid dreams.\n\nThis account of waking and sleep may also have consequences for the\nimagination model of dreaming and dream skepticism (Soteriou 2017). As\nin the imagination model, dreaming would be passive and action,\nincluding cognitive agency, would be tied to waking. If dreaming\nnonetheless involved passive episodes of imagining oneself to be\nactive, one would be unable to tell that one were dreaming and\nimagining, as this insight would require the exercise of real agency.\nThe sceptical consequence would be that when dreaming, one would lose\nagency as well as the capacity to gain insight into one\u2019s\ncurrent state. Yet our ability to know we are waking when waking would\nbe unscathed; according to Soteriou, waking would thus have an\nepistemic function connected to the capacity to exercise agency over\nour mental lives.\n\nFinally, definitions of consciousness themselves are bound up with\nconceptions of sleep and dreaming. As dreaming went from a state whose\nexperiential status was doubted to being widely recognized as a second\nglobal state of consciousness, consciousness sometimes came to be\ndefined contrastively as that which disappears in deep, dreamless\nsleep and reappears in waking and dreaming (Searle 2000; Tononi 2008).\nIn light of dreamless sleep experience, such definitions are\nproblematic (Thompson 2014, 2015; Windt 2015b; Windt et al. 2016).\nDreamless sleep experience has been proposed to be particularly\nrelevant for understanding minimal phenomenal experience, or the\nconditions under which the simplest kind of conscious experience\narises (Windt 2015b). The investigation of dreamless sleep might thus\nshed light on the transition from unconscious sleep to sleep-related\nexperience.\n",
