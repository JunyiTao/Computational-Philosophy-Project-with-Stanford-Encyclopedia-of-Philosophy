    "main_text": "F\u00e2r\u00e2b\u00ee\u2019s project of reviving the sciences of the ancients\n1. F\u00e2r\u00e2b\u00ee\u2019s project of reviving the sciences of the ancients\n\nF\u00e2r\u00e2b\u00ee does metaphysics, not by writing a commentary\non Aristotle\u2019s Metaphysics, but by trying to\nreconstruct Aristotle\u2019s aims and demonstrative method and to\nwrite the book that Aristotle would have written had he been writing\nin Arabic for a largely Muslim readership. This is a part of\nF\u00e2r\u00e2b\u00ee\u2019s approach to the \u201csciences of\nthe ancients\u201d, i.e., to Greek philosophy, mathematics, and\nmedicine, with all their sub-disciplines. A brief summary follows but,\nfor a fuller account, see\n Supplement: F\u00e2r\u00e2b\u00ee\u2019s project of reviving the sciences of the ancients.\n\nF\u00e2r\u00e2b\u00ee, more than any other medieval philosopher,\ndistrusts the surface appearance of Greek philosophy as presented to\nhim in the Arabic translations. He tries to go beyond this surface to\nreconstruct the ancient authors\u2019 aims and methods, and even to\nreconstruct the structure of their Greek expressions, which he\nsuspects have been badly served by the Arabic translations. In some\ncases the Greek texts he is interested in were not available to him\neven in Arabic translation, but only in translations of later ancient\nsummaries or descriptions, but this does not stop him from trying to\nreconstruct their underlying thought. (He has access to translations\nof almost all of the texts of Aristotle that we have now, but\napparently to none of the texts of Plato.) He thinks this is worth the\neffort because he thinks that the Greeks, especially Plato and\nAristotle, developed sciences which have since decayed or have been\ntransmitted only imperfectly to the Arabic-writing Muslim-ruled lands,\nbut which it is still possible to reconstruct and to apply to the\nurgent questions of his own time.\n\nF\u00e2r\u00e2b\u00ee is particularly interested in applying the\n\u201csciences of the ancients\u201d, and particularly metaphysics,\nto resolve the issues addressed and disputed by the \u201creligious\nsciences\u201d within Islam, especially kal\u00e2m or\n\u201cdialectical theology\u201d. These issues include whether the\nworld was created in time or has existed from eternity, proofs of\nGod\u2019s existence and of his having no partner or contrary,\nGod\u2019s attributes (knowledge, power, will \u2026) and his\naction in creating the world, and how his causality relates to the\ncausality of creatures. (F\u00e2r\u00e2b\u00ee systematically\naddresses these issues, as well as kal\u00e2m issues about\nprophecy, the religious community, and the \u201creturn\u201d or\nafterlife, in his Principles of the Opinions of the Perfect\nCity: see\n Section 4\n below.) F\u00e2r\u00e2b\u00ee thinks that the arguments about\nthese issues within the Muslim community (and other religious\ncommunities within the Muslim world) have been merely dialectical, so\nthat it is equally possible to argue on both sides of each issue. He\nthinks that if the sciences of the ancients, especially metaphysics,\ncan be reconstructed and practiced according to a demonstrative\nmethod, they will be able to resolve these disputes. He thinks,\nhowever, that earlier philosophers in the Muslim world, in practicing\nwhat they saw as Platonic or Aristotelian philosophy, have argued\nsub-demonstratively, and so have been unable to resolve the disputes.\nF\u00e2r\u00e2b\u00ee claims to be the first person in the Muslim\nworld to have mastered Aristotle\u2019s Posterior Analytics\nand so recaptured Aristotle\u2019s demonstrative method. And he\nclaims to be the first to have understood Aristotle\u2019s\nMetaphysics, and to have mastered the science of being and\nits universal attributes which gives the only scientific foundation\nfor making judgments about God and his causality.\n\nF\u00e2r\u00e2b\u00ee and his contemporaries use the word\n\u201cphilosophy\u201d (in Arabic \u201cfalsafa\u201d),\nborrowed from the Greek, only for those schools and disciplines that\npresent themselves as continuing ancient Greek philosophy. Before\nF\u00e2r\u00e2b\u00ee\u2019s time this kind of philosophy was\nmainly practiced, in the Muslim world, by Christians, often\nSyriac-Arabic bilinguals (and almost all the translators of Greek\ntexts were Christian); although Christian philosophers also had Muslim\nand Jewish students, and although some Isma\u02bfili Shi\u02bfites had\nintegrated a version of Greek philosophy into their ideal of what the\nimam must know. F\u00e2r\u00e2b\u00ee wants to break the\nassociation of philosophy with particular (and often marginalized)\nlinguistic and religious communities. The Arabic grammarian\nS\u00eer\u00e2f\u00ee had accused F\u00e2r\u00e2b\u00ee\u2019s\nChristian teacher Ab\u00fb Bishr Matt\u00e2 of presenting as\nuniversal rules of logic, normative for any rational being, what were\nsimply rules of Greek grammar, as translated from Greek through Syriac\ninto Arabic and probably damaged in translation. Against this charge,\nF\u00e2r\u00e2b\u00ee wants to show that logic, and philosophy is\ngeneral, is not community-bound like Arabic grammar or Muslim\nkal\u00e2m. Logic is to thought as the grammar of a\nparticular language is to that language: its rules apply to all\nthought insofar as it is correct, whatever language it may be\nexpressed in, and they give the common core shared by all languages,\nabstracted from the merely conventional and community-relative aspects\nof particular languages. And philosophy is to religion as logic is to\ngrammar, giving rules for how to think about God and the physical\nworld and human beings, and therefore for how to act to achieve the\naim of human life, which apply to all humans insofar as they reason\nand act correctly; and these rules give the common core of doctrines\nand practical prescriptions shared by all religions, or at least by a\nplurality of correct religions, abstracted from the merely\nconventional and community-relative aspects of particular\nreligions.\n",
