    "main_text": "Central criticisms of Sociobiology and Behavioral Ecology || The Heritability of Behavioral Traits\n4.2 The Heritability of Behavioral Traits\n\nWhile it seems that the accusation that the early \u201cPop\u201d\nsociobiologists were genetic determinists was probably unfair, there\nis a related objection that can be raised to both \u201cPop\u201d\nsociobiology and to the later forms of human and non-human behavioral\necology, i.e. that any trait\u2019s being an adaptation requires that\nthat trait be heritable, and most human behaviors are not\nheritable. To say a trait is heritable in the simplest sense is just\nto say that if the parent has that trait, then the trait tends also to\nappear in the offspring (i.e. to say the trait is heritable simply\nmeans that the trait is inherited reliably). The more\ndemanding population genetic definition of heritability is that a\nheritable trait T is one where variation in T can be accounted for\nprimarily by variation in genes as opposed to variation in the\nenvironment (see also the entry on\n heritability).\n Heritability in this sense is supposed to be required for natural\nselection because in order for natural selection to spread a variant T\nin a population, when T increases the average number of offspring of\nits possessors, those offspring have to reliably also have T if T is\nto spread at the expense of the other variants. The problem, however,\nis that many human behavioral traits do not seem likely to be\nheritable in this way: they tend to vary greatly across and even\nwithin cultures and environments, whereas human genetic variation is\nmuch too low to account for such differences (Buller, 2005; Cosmides\nand Tooby, 1987).\n\nHowever, HBEs can get around this problem, by pointing out that local\npatterns of overt behavior are manifestations of more general\nstrategies; differences in the environment cause the manifestations of\ndifferent elements of these complex behavioral dispositions humans\npossess. For example, the patterns of foraging behavior of the Ache\npeople in the Paraguay rain forest (Hill and Hurtado, 1996) and the\nInuit in the Arctic (Smith, 1991) are very different, and the genetic\ndifferences between these groups are insufficient to explain them.\nHowever, both could be simply local manifestations of a larger and\nmore general foraging strategy (or strategies) which humans possess,\nwhich could be heritable and an adaptation. A behavioral strategy is,\nafter all, simply a complex behavioral disposition, which involves\nresponding in a variety of specific ways to a set of environmental\ncues, most of which would be achieved by having an appropriate\npsychological mechanism or mechanisms underlying the set of\ndispositions. In which case, heritability of a behavioral strategy\nonly depends on there being a psychological mechanism or mechanisms\nthat produces that strategy reliably, and that mechanism\u2019s\nitself being heritable. Of course, whether there are such heritable\nmechanisms for the behavioral strategies in which the HBEs are\ninterested is likely to be a matter of some controversy.\n\nWhat\u2019s more, some philosophers have argued that it is possible\nfor traits to be adaptations in the standard sense even when they are\nnot heritable according to the population genetic\n definition[7].\n Despite the claim above that heritability in the population genetic\nsense is required as a condition of the action of natural selection,\ntechnically all that is required for natural selection to occur on a\ntrait T is for T to be heritable in the weaker sense, i.e. that it be\nrobustly transmitted, such that the trait variant in a parent tends to\nturn up reliably in the offspring. The reason heritability in the\npopulation genetic sense was believed to also be necessary for natural\nselection was that genes were believed to be the only developmental\nresource transmitted to offspring, so only if variation in traits\nfollowed variation in genes would traits be subject to natural\nselection for the reasons described above. However, recently a variety\nof philosophers and scientists have argued (Odling-Smee et al., 2003;\nSterelny, 2003, 2007, 2012) that natural selection can occur on traits\neven if traits vary most with the environment rather than genes,\nso long as environments can themselves be transmitted down\nlineages; Sterelny\u2019s suggestion is that this might be\nachieved by robust niche construction. This has an interesting\nconsequence: if highly reliably transmitted cultural traits could be\nsubject to natural selection, standard evolutionary methods and models\nof the sorts used in behavioral ecology could be used to understand\nthe evolution of such traits.\n\nThis is the not the end of the problem, however. Some philosophers\nhave argued that not all traits that are culturally transmitted or\nlearnt can be properly understood using adaptationist methods, because\nmany of these traits are not heritable even in this weaker sense, and\nhence cannot be adaptations (Driscoll, 2009; Driscoll and Stich, 2008;\nKitcher, 1990). Worse, such traits could appear highly adaptive on\nevolutionary models. For example, traits which are subject to highly\nadaptive individual learning or adaptive social transmission processes\nin populations (Henrich and Boyd, 1998; Henrich and Gil-White, 2001)\nare nevertheless not adaptations because they are not shaped by\nnatural\n selection[8].\n This is because in many of these cases, the features of the\nenvironment that make the trait appear adaptive may not actually have\nfeatured as selection conditions in the causal history of the trait\n(or perhaps as causes in any sense). In such cases, evolutionary\nmethods popular in sociobiology and the current evolutionary social\nsciences (such as optimality modeling) will make traits appear to be\nadaptations to those conditions when they are not. For a more detailed\ndiscussion of dual inheritance theory, gene culture co-evolution and\nthe associated theory, see the entry on\n cultural evolution.\n",
