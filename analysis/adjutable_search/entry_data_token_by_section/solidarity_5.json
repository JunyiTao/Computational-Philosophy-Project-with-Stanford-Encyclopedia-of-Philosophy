In the Church\u2019s\nresponse, Pope Leo XIII\u2019s Rerum Novarum (1891)\u2014a\nstaple of Catholic social thought\u2014tries to steal a march on the\nsocialists by incorporating and reworking one of the socialist\u2019s\nmain rallying points, namely the idea of mutualism within\nworker\u2019s associations. In those passages, Leo cites Ecclesiastes\napprovingly on the importance of fraternity: \n\n\n\u201cIt is better that two should be together than one; for they\nhave the advantage of their society. If one fall he shall be supported\nby the other. Woe to him that is alone, for when he falleth he hath\nnone to lift him up\u201d. And further: \u201cA brother that is\nhelped by his brother is like a strong city\u201d. It is this natural\nimpulse which binds men together in civil society; and it is likewise\nthis which leads them to join together in associations. (Leo XIII\n1891: \u00a750)\n\n\nBut it was not until much later that the term gets used explicitly. In\nthe 1967 encyclical Populorum Progressio, on global\ndevelopment and the inequality between rich and poor nations, Pope\nPaul VI invokes the unmistakably Solidarist notion that\ninterdependence creates social obligations:\n\n\nWe are the heirs of earlier generations, and we reap benefits from the\nefforts of our contemporaries; we are under obligation to all men.\nTherefore we cannot disregard the welfare of those who will come after\nus to increase the human family. The reality of human solidarity\nbrings us not only benefits but also obligations. (\u00a717)\n\n\nThe origin of the Church\u2019s union of interdependence and\nsolidarity lies in an earlier nineteenth-century current of thought\noften referred to as Christian Solidarism. In Ethics and the\nNational Economy (1918), its founder and most prominent advocate,\nHeinrich Pesch (1854\u20131926), writes:\n\n\nChristianity teaches us that people, despite all individual and also\nsocial differences in occupation and ownership, are nevertheless\nsocii, i.e., comrades, precisely by virtue of those\ndifferences. They are dependent on each other and bound together by a\nsolidaristic community of interests in all of their\nindustrial relationships as masters and journeymen, as employers and\nworkers, and in the human race overall, which is the great universal\nfamily of nations. (Pesch 1918 [2004: 104])\n\n\nOn this corporatist understanding, it is not just the shared\nexperience of human suffering, or the understanding of the human being\nas imago dei, but a recognition of the interdependence of\nhuman beings in society that grounds a demand to share one\nanother\u2019s fate. On this picture, we are meant to recognize how\nboth our flourishing and our suffering is a result of mutual influence\nand mutual reliance in and through the multiple associations to which\nwe belong; in response, we have obligations to share others\u2019\nfates by coming to others\u2019 aid and by limiting the harm we\ndo.\n\nAs is widely recognized, John Paul II was also deeply influenced by\nthis strand of Catholic Social Thought (and its realization in Leo\nXIII\u2019s Rerum\n Novarum).[8]\n In Sollicitudo rei socialis, he writes:\n\n\nWhen interdependence becomes recognized [\u2026], the correlative\nresponse as a moral and social attitude, as a \u201cvirtue\u201d, is\nsolidarity. This then is not a feeling of vague compassion or shallow\ndistress at the misfortunes of so many people, both near and far. On\nthe contrary, it is a firm and persevering determination to commit\noneself to the common good; that is to say to the good of all and of\neach individual, because we are all really responsible for all. (John\nPaul II 1987: \u00a7V)\n\n\nOn this reading, the ground of solidarity is, as in Bourgeois and\nDurkheim, an identification based on our role in the division of\nlabor, which includes a recognition that participation in an\nunjust social order perpetuates suffering, and makes us accomplices.\nThe doctrine goes hand in hand with the Church\u2019s teaching on\nsubsidiarity, in which local associations\u2014including perhaps most\nimportantly the family\u2014have ethical priority to more general,\nencompassing associations, such as the state. More general and\nencompassing organizing units should intervene in the affairs of the\nlower only to help or aid them in the accomplishment of their tasks.\nOn this understanding, the response to individual suffering must be\ncollective; it cannot be done by individuals acting alone, but by each\nbody, at each level of generality, working together as a unit to\npreserve the common good. As Pope Francis noted in a follow-up\ncatechism to his COVID19 encyclical Fratelli Tutti, \n\n\nthere is no true solidarity without social participation, without the\ncontribution of intermediary bodies: families, associations,\ncooperatives, small businesses, and other expressions of society.\nEveryone needs to contribute, everyone. (Francis\n 2020)[9]\n\n",
