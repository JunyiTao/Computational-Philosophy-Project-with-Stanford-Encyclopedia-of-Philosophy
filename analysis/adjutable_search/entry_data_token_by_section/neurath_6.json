    "main_text": "Philosophy of psychology, education, and the social sciences || Philosophy of education\n5.3 Philosophy of the social sciences\n\nAs in the case of philosophy of psychology, Neurath\u2019s\nphilosophical theory of the social sciences was his attempt at a\nparadigmatic application of the logical empiricist framework that\nreplaced philosophy as a speculative and autonomous source of\nknowledge. Philosophy was now the reflexive perspective of unified\nscience and it was constituted by two meta-theoretical approaches to\nscience: logical analysis and empirical theory, that is, the\n\u2018logic of science\u2019\u2014emphasized by Carnap\u2014 and\nthe \u2018behavioristics of science\u2019\u2014emphasized by\nNeurath. The non-formal, empirical, perspective, allied to the\n\u2018scientific attitude\u2019, became in 1931 Neurath\u2019s\nphysicalism, his compromise between empiricism and\nmaterialism\u2014Mach and Marx\u2014; this was also his attempt at a\nresolution of the conflict between experience and objectivity (of\nscientific knowledge), which Carnap attempted through the formal\naspect of structural descriptions and logical relations. \n\nWork on the foundation of the social sciences, a critical\nmeta-theoretical discussion, was of special importance to Neurath as a\ncore motivation behind the very program of logical empiricism. Because\nknowledge is a tool (whether propaganda or reform), only the best\npossible tool would help transform society. Science was precisely the\nantidote to the speculative, metaphysical, philosophical discourses\nbehind much racist, classist, nationalistic and oppressive ideology,\npolitics and social theory. In this sense, Neurath\u2019s exposition\nof his own social and economic views was from the beginning of his\ncareer inseparable from an element of meta-theoretical or\nphilosophical discussion and motivation (elicited by the opposition\nfrom the more dominant, orthodox doctrines and their proponents).\nNeurath\u2019s views on the social sciences are also the source of\nmuch of his distinctive, non-reductionistic, views on physicalism and\nunity within the movement of logical empiricism (Cartwright et\nal. 1996).\n\nPhysicalism encompasses psychology, history, economics and sociology\nwithout reducing them to physics. Social sciences are scientific\nwithin the framework of physicalism, namely, insofar as they describe\nconcrete spatially and temporally ordered events and processes and\nmake predictions about them (Neurath 1931b/1973, 325). Social behavior\nis itself a complex and its prediction requires that sociology\nincorporate various sources such as history, ethics, jurisprudence,\neconomics, ethnography, etc. (ibid., 328). For Neurath,\nMarx\u2019s study of capital is important first and foremost as an\ninstance of empirical research that brings together history and\neconomics, and the most complete case of physicalist sociology\n(ibid., 349). Sociology is a synthetic effort part of in turn\na larger synthetic effort that is unified science, the set of all\nconnectible languages and laws required to describe and predict order.\nThe synthetic dimension is inseparable from the empirical one: It is\nthe formal, linguistic and conceptual, expression of the totalistic,\nholist approach required by the conception of empirical reality as a\ncomplex, including the phenomena of \u2018concrete ways of\nlife\u2019. Empirically determinable behaviors are partial\ndescriptions, separations, for instance \u2018peoples\u2019 are\n\u2018loosely separable sections of the mass of men\u2019\n(ibid., 332). In general, concreteness and complexity are\ncharacteristics of reality that language expresses, especially\nunanalyzed and imprecise cluster (Ballung)-type terms.\n\nThe alliance between unity and empiricism, or physicalism, is thrown\ninto further relief by contrast with the post-Diltheyan German\nsociology of Windelband, Rickert, Sombart and especially Weber. They\ndistinguished between the natural and the social sciences and, as\ndistinctive feature of the latter, in Weber\u2019s sociology there\nappear non-scientific, non-behavioristic entities and activities such\nas the spirit of the age (Zeitgeist), and empathy or\nunderstanding, poetic activity that grounds what he calls\n\u2018Verstehende sociology\u2019 (ibid., 353).\nNeurath\u2019s was willing to accept the use of such concepts\nprovided they could be given a physicalistic meaning. \n\nNeurath emphasized attention to individuals and groups, individuated\nin terms of stimulus/response interrelationship and clusters of shared\ncustoms and habits, and, for instance, the transfer of such habits or\ntraditions (ibid., 371), which is how he defined education\n(see above). The empirical conceptualization of the social units is\nGestalt-like and holistic, like the silhouettes, patterns or profiles\nof total life plans: \u2018Peoples, states, age groups, religious\ncommunities, all are complexes built up of single individuals. Such\ncomposite groups have certain interconnections which are ruled by\nlaws, and they have a definite \u2018physiognomy\u2019. The separate\nfeatures of these complexes are not independent of each other but are\nrelated\u2019 (ibid., 387). Decisions and predictions, as in\nthe case of social planning, often involved the \u2018comparison of\ntotal complexes\u2019 (ibid.).\n\nCiting Mill, Neurath noted that empiricism brings the natural and the\nsocial sciences together, but so do some of its limits. The\nmarkers of empirical science are the practices of observation,\nexperimentation and prediction. Laws are merely vehicles for taking us\nfrom the concrete and unique to the concrete and unique, whether in\nbiology or history. Sociology is like geology and biology in that the\npossibility of many experiments is prevented by certain\nconstraints of ethical values or scale (ibid., 365).\nPredictability is characterized by nine conditions. It is\nbased on (1) the availability of generalizations about groups and (2)\nstable conditions, or control, and for a limited period. Control is a\nkey notion that connects empiricism and engineering, mechanical and\nsocial. Neurath didn\u2019t think that laws of physics, for instance,\nare in that sense more universal or unconditioned:\n\u2018Mariotte\u2019s law in physics holds only within certain\nlimits\u2019 (ibid., 331). (3) Correlations on which\npredictions are based are the product of induction, and inductive\nconclusions, in sociology as elsewhere, are based on a decision\n(Neurath 1931b/1973, 407). (4) Moreover, sociology, like the natural\nsciences, often has recourse to information, including laws, from\nother disciplines, in a local synthetic effort of predictive value\n(ibid., 364). (5) Holism prevents sociology from the\n\u2018ideal forecast\u2019 associated with the fiction of the\nLaplacean mind and the availability of molecular descriptions of\nindividuals free from instabilities (in a symposium on Pasqual\nJordan\u2019s quantum mechanics, Neurath addressed the new\nperspective from quantum mechanics on the problem of free will and its\nconflict with the determinism (causality) of natural laws as riddled\nwith metaphysics (Neurath 1935)). One may not expect, however, that\naggregations or complexes will be always more predictable than\nindividuals, since the evolution of the complex might depend on the\ninteraction with individuals and the environment in a way affected by\nchance. Instead, it has to make do with \u2018rough facts of a\ncomplex character\u2019 (ibid., 405) in a \u2018system of\nentangled habits\u2019 (ibid., 371 and 374), and most social\ntypes of behavior in a group are not \u2018autonomously\ncomputable\u2019 and have to be regarded as \u2018parts of the\ncomplex that is being investigated at the time\u2019, considering\n\u2018the whole of life\u2019 of the group, since each\n\u2018historical period = non-analysed complex of conditions\u2019\n(Neurath 1932a/1983, 76 and 85); he would subsequently speak of\naggregations (Neurath 1944a). Any resulting prediction or explanation\n(retrodiction) of individual behavior is an approximation to a\n\u2018world history without names\u2019. (6) A linguistic\nimplication is that empiricism in general and the social sciences in\nparticular are dependent on non-univocal, indistinct\nterms\u2014\u2018a \u201cclot\u201d (German Ballung,\nFrench gr\u00e9gat)\u2019\u2014, in both protocol\nstatements (see above) and theories insofar as they are sensitive to\ncultural phenomena and historically inherited concepts that cannot be\nusefully replaced with precise technical terms of the \u2018modern\ninternational folklore\u2019 (Neurath 1944a, 5\u20137, 18). (7) The\n\u2018multivocality\u2019 of the relation between phenomena and\ntheoretical interpretations is more pervasive than the sort of\npluralism Duhem noted in physics, and leads Neurath to speak of\n\u2018pluri-items\u2019 (ibid., 14). (8) Certain phenomena\nor entities such as inventions can only be predicted provided one has\nalso the means to create them (Neurath 1931b/1973, 405); this insight\nis typically attributed to the critic of Neurath Popper, who published\nit much later. (9) Sociological predictions are co-determinants in the\noccurrence of the predicted event, for instance a position in the\nstock market or a political revolution (ibid., 405); the\nprediction may have a reinforcing or a preventive character (he wrote\nabout self-fulfilling prophecies as early as 1921, in his polemic\nagainst Spengler; Neurath 1921). Theory becomes part of practice;\nscientist becomes part of the social scene (ibid., 406).\n\nA related issue is Max Weber\u2019s issue of value-freedom,\nand objectivity, in the social sciences. Neurath noted that all\nsciences are based on values that determine the choice of relevant\naspects, phenomena, quantities, etc. This is not just consistent with,\nbut an implication of his voluntarism and his\n\u2018rationalism\u2019. Value-free methods are not essential for\nscientific practice. The formulation of a question or the choice of a\nquantity might be value-dependent but their respective answer or\nmeasurement will not be so in the same sense (ibid.,\n364\u20135). Neurath formulated the same idea in terms of\ntheory-dependence: the putting right questions and making the right\nobservations require a \u2018meta-concept\u2019 or an\n\u2018approximate theory\u2019 (ibid., 388\u201389).\n\nIn spite of these caveats, the value of the social sciences remains\nattached to the value of empirical knowledge and the scientific\nattitude in the social roots of our life: \u2018Even where\nsociologists cannot make predictions, they may provide men of action\nor meditation with empiricist material. (\u2026) We argue\ndifferently and act differently when we know the material provided by\nthe social sciences. (\u2026) altering our scientific language is\ncohesive with altering out social and private life\u2019 (Neurath\n1944a, 46).\n\nFinally, we should address the reflexive value of the social sciences\ninsofar as science plays the meta-theoretical and critical role of\nphilosophy, displacing any alternative, autonomous and speculative\nsource of insight. History of science, for instance, will require\nadequate classifications for the purposes of advancing correlations.\nIn that regard, it will benefit from avoiding narrow dichotomies of\nclassification and adopt, instead, the notion of theory \u2013\napplied in economic planning \u2013 that aims at exploring all\npossibilities in the form of a matrix of combinations, realized and\nunrealized (in the tradition of encyclopedic and symbolic calculus of\nLlull and Leibniz). Neurath himself provided an application to the\ncase of optics (Neurath 1916/1983 and Neurath 1944a, 42). Similarly\nfor sociology, the search of an adequate classification of hypotheses\nin the first step. Notice, however, that the epistemological\nrelativism associated with logical empiricism is not the outcome\nsolely of such external sociological perspective or naturalistic and\nempirical considerations about scientific practice, but the\nphilosophical rejection of Kant\u2019s synthetic a priori and, as\nalternative to Kant\u2019s approach to apriorism, the development of\nconventionalism by Carnap, Reichenbach and others inherited from\nDuhem, Poincar\u00e9 and others concerning the exact sciences\n(Nemeth 2007, 283\u20134). Otherwise, Neurath pointed to the\nreflexivity of the social character of science itself and declared\nthat sociologists argued, decided and acted in science as they\nthemselves and others do in society. They are on the same boat with\nus; the boat of social sciences is just like that of the unified\nscience and of social planning itself. This notion of social\nscientists, thinking up and putting in place possibilities under\nconditions of uncertainty, prompted Neurath\u2019s final version of\nthe boat analogy:\n\n\nImagine sailors, who, far out at sea, transform the shape of their\nclumsy vessel from a more circular to a more fishlike one. They make\nuse of some drifting timber, besides the timber of the old structure,\nto modify the skeleton and the hull of their vessel. But they cannot\nput the ship in dock in order to start from scratch. During their work\nthey stay on the old structure and deal with heavy gales and\nthundering waves. In transforming their ship they take care that\ndangerous leakages do not occur. A new ship grows out of the old one,\nstep by step\u2014and while they are still building, the sailors may\nalready be thinking of a new structure, and they will not always agree\nwith one another. The whole business will go on in a way that we\ncannot even anticipate today. That is our fate. (Neurath 1944a,\n47)\n\n\nCriticisms came from Viennese social scientists such as Karl Menger,\nEdgar Zilsel and Felix Kaufmann. Zilsel, an ally of the Circle,\nobjected to the programmatic nature of Neurath\u2019s foundational\nwork, namely, that it was empiricism without empirical research. They\nall objected to the narrow strictures on the relation between the\nnatural and the human sciences imposed by physicalism. Kaufmann, in\nparticular, defended a phenomenological sociology, following Husserl\nmuch more closely than Carnap especially did, based on the value of\nintrospective experience, although without the scientifically\nmysterious Weberian method of empathy (Uebel 2007, 255\u201357).\n\nZilsel, Frank and Neurath had learned from Mach the value of history\nas a creative source of theoretical possibilities and critical\nperspective. Mach had called his approach \u2018historical-critical\nmethod\u2019 which echoed in his heirs\u2019 ears with relevant\nreferences to Kant and Marx, and was understood to support the\nrejection of superhuman metaphysical inevitability. Like Reichenbach,\nZilsel replaced the Kantian inquiry into the preconditions of the\npossibility scientific knowledge with more modest and\nanti-metaphysical projects, in his case, centered on the\nempirical\u2014social political, economic-preconditions. Later on,\nPhilip Frank advocated the empirical historical studies of science as\npart of the more complete answer to the question of the choice of\nhypotheses raised by Duhem and Poincar\u00e9, and the insufficiency\nof the logical inference that grounded their conventionalism. These\nare important sources and precedents of modern empirical studies of\nscience.\n",
