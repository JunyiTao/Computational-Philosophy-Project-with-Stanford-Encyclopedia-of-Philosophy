    "main_text": "Elements of Capacity || Reasoning\n4.4 Reasoning\n\nWithout the mental ability to engage in reasoning and manipulate\ninformation rationally, it is impossible for understanding and\nappreciation to issue in a decision (Buchanan & Brock 1989:\n24\u201325; Grisso & Appelbaum 1998: 52\u201358). Interestingly,\nhowever, the concept of reasoning is often left vague in discussions\nof decisional capacity. Probably this is because insisting on too high\nand specific a normative standard of reasoning might risk ruling that\na majority of subjects lack capacity, which, again, risks ruling too\nmany people incompetent.\n\nYet normative standards of reasoning sometimes do get mentioned, for\nexample, consistency and the ability to derive conclusions from\npremises (Freedman 1981). More often reasoning is said to include the\nability to weigh risks and benefits and evaluate putative\nconsequences. Again, no specific normative criteria for success are\nspelled out. Difficult cases must therefore be assessed\nindividually.\n\nMost theorists seem to agree that possessing these four abilities, at\nleast to some degree, is necessary for capacity. The primary\nissue (explored further in\n \u00a76)\n is about whether the four abilities are always sufficient or\nwhether there are cases in which something else, some further\nabilities or some further feature of the subject\u2019s choice, might\nbe relevant to the assessment of capacity. The three elements most\ncommonly cited by critics are (1) the subject\u2019s emotions, (2)\nthe subject\u2019s values, and (3) the authenticity of a\nsubject\u2019s choice.\n",
