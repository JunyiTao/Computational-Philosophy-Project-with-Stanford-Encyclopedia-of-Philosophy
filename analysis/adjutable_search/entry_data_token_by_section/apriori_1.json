What sorts of propositions can be a priori justified and known: all, and only, modal propositions?\n\nPhilosophers generally agree that we can be justified in believing\n 15bi\n and\n 15biii\n only empirically. Yet many believe that they are necessarily true. If\nthey are necessarily true, that would mean that it\u2019s false that\nwe can be justified in believing necessary truths only a\npriori. But some philosophers think that\n 15bi\n and\n 15biii\n are not necessary truths and the relevant necessary truth that we can\nknow a priori is that the essence of any type of matter is\ngiven by the basic elements of which it is composed. On this view, in\nthe case of water and rubies, we discover empirically what those basic\nelements are and the propositions that state those discoveries are\ncontingent. Philosophers who hold that\n 15bi\n and\n 15biii\n do express necessary truths usually think that there are descriptions\nthat fix the reference of the terms, for example, for water, the\ndescription, \n\n\nthe stuff, whatever it is, that, in the actual world, has the\nproperties of quenching thirst, putting out certain fires, falling\nfrom the clouds as rain, filling the lakes and rivers, etc. \n\n\nWhile the meaning of \u201cwater\u201d is given by this\nreference-fixing description, and can be known a priori, the\nessence of water must be discovered empirically. The meaning of\nnatural kind terms does not give the essence of the kind directly in\nthe way it does with \u201cbachelor\u201d and \u201cvixen\u201d.\n\n\nOne might think that\n 15a\n can be justified only empirically, but gemologists seem to think that\nit is conceptually necessary that rubies are red, that is,\nthat the meaning of \u201cruby\u201d requires that rubies be red. So\ngiven how gemologists use \u201cruby\u201d,\n 15a\n is knowable a priori. The notion of a ruby seems to be a\nhybrid notion: its color is knowable a priori but its\nmaterial essence as given in\n 15bi\n is knowable only empirically.\n\nWhile it is widely believed that some necessary truths are capable of\njustification and can be known only empirically (e.g., \u201cWater is\nH2O\u201d), some contingent truths also seem justifiable, and\nknowable, a priori. Saul Kripke proposed that \u201cthe\nstandard meter stick, S, in Paris is a meter long at\n\\(t_0\\)\u201d is such an example (Kripke 1972: 274\u2013275).\n\u201cThe length of S in the actual world at\n\\(t_0\\)\u201d rigidly designates that length, that is, it refers to\nlength L in every possible world. The reference of \u201cone\nmeter\u201d is given by that reference-fixing description, so\n\u201cone meter\u201d rigidly designates L. However,\n\u201cthe length of S at \\(t_0\\)\u201d does not rigidly\ndesignate any particular length since at \\(t_0\\) in other possible\nworlds S will be longer or shorter than L. So the\nproposition that \u201cS is a meter long at \\(t_0\\)\u201d is\ncontingent because in other possible worlds that very same stick will\nbe shorter or longer than it was in the actual world at that time.\nStill, we can know a priori, that is, independent of any\nempirical evidence, that \u201cS is a meter long at\n\\(t_0\\)\u201d is true in the actual world given that we know how the\nreference of \u201cone meter\u201d is fixed by a description that\nrefers to the length of S in the actual world. If empirical\nevidence plays any role, it is only insofar as we need it to know that\nthere really is a stick, S, that was designated as the meter at\nsome particular time and place. \n\nA second candidate for being a contingent proposition that is knowable\na priori comes from John Turri. He claims that the\nproposition, \u201cThe most unlikely possible event is not presently\noccurring\u201d, is contingent yet can be known simply in virtue of\nunderstanding its content, and hence is knowable a priori\n(2011: 337\u2013338). \u201cThe most unlikely possible event\u201d\nrefers to an event that is maximally improbable. So we know a\npriori that no one could have sufficient reason to believe that\nan event that fits that description is now occurring. Still, it is\npossible that such an event is presently occurring. Thus we can know\na priori that the contingent proposition that says that a\nmaximally improbable event is now occurring is false, and that its\ndenial is true.\n\nA third candidate for being a contingent proposition that is knowable\na priori is offered by Gareth Evans. He thinks that we can be\na priori justified in believing, and know, propositions of\nthe form, \u201cIf actually p, then p\u201d, and particular\ninstantiations of that form. Consider, \u201cif any post is actually\nred, then it is red\u201d. This proposition is contingent because the\npost could be red in the actual world but not red in some other\npossible world. So in some other possible world, \\(w_2\\), its\nantecedent can be true (because its antecedent is about the color of\nthe post in the actual world, \\(w_1\\)) and it\u2019s consequent false\n(because the post is not red in \\(w_2\\) and the consequent is\nabout the color of the post in that world). A conditional that is\nnecessarily true cannot have a true antecedent and a false consequent\nin any possible world. However, we can know independently of\nexperience (that is, a priori) that if the post is actually\nred, then it\u2019s red since it is true in the actual world (cf.,\nEvans 1979: 83\u201385, for his discussion of this topic).\n\nAnother candidate for the contingent a priori is the\nproposition expressed by, \u201cI am here now\u201d. That sentence\nexpresses a contingent proposition, since I do not have to exist, much\nless do I have to be where I actually am at the present time. Yet a\nperson can know it is true wherever and whenever she utters it\nregardless of the experiences she is currently having or has had in\nthe past, and so independently of experience.\n\nLeaving aside now the question of whether there can be contingent\npropositions that are knowable a priori, there seems to be a\ndifference within the class of necessarily true propositions that can\nbe known, or justifiably believed, a priori. The propositions\nexpressed by\n 10a\u201314a\n seem different from the propositions expressed by\n 1a\u20138a.\n Each of the latter propositions seem to be analytic, that is, in each\ncase the sentence that expresses the proposition will express a\nlogical truth if relevant terms and expressions in it are replaced by\nappropriate synonyms. So, for instance, \u201call vixens are\nfemale\u201d will express a logical truth of the form if \\(A \\amp\nB\\), then A if we substitute for \u201cvixen\u201d,\n\u201cfemale fox\u201d, for it will then say: if something is a\nfemale fox, it is a female. But no substitution of synonyms for terms\nor expressions in\n 10a\u201314a\n will yield a logical truth. The propositions expressed by\n 10a\u201314a\n are often said to be synthetic a priori propositions because\nthey are not analytic (they are not true in virtue of their meaning,\nas it is sometimes put) but are a priori knowable and\njustifiable. \n",
