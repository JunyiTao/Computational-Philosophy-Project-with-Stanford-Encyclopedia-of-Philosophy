    "main_text": "Introduction\n1. Introduction\n\nThe fundamental idea of the MWI, going back to Everett 1957, is that\nthere are myriads of worlds in the Universe in addition to the world\nwe are aware of. In particular, every time a quantum experiment with\ndifferent possible outcomes is performed, all outcomes are obtained,\neach in a different newly created world, even if we are only aware of\nthe world with the outcome we have seen. The reader can split the\nworld right now using this interactive\n quantum world splitter.\n The creation of worlds takes place everywhere, not just in physics\nlaboratories, for example, the explosion of a star during a\nsupernova.\n\nThere are numerous variations and reinterpretations of the original\nEverett proposal, most of which are briefly discussed in the entry on\n Everett\u2019s relative state formulation of quantum mechanics.\n Here, a particular approach to the MWI (which differs from the\npopular \u201cactual splitting worlds\u201d approach in De Witt\n1970) will be presented in detail, followed by a discussion relevant\nfor many variants of the MWI.\n\nThe MWI consists of two parts:\n\nA theory which yields the time evolution of the quantum state of\nthe (single) Universe.\nA prescription which sets up a correspondence between the quantum\nstate of the Universe and our experiences.\n\n\nPart (i) states that the ontology of the universe is a quantum state,\nwhich evolves according to the Schr\u00f6dinger equation or its\nrelativistic generalization. It is a rigorous mathematical theory and\nis not problematic philosophically. Part (ii) involves \u201cour\nexperiences\u201d which do not have a rigorous definition. An\nadditional difficulty in setting up (ii) follows from the fact that\nhuman languages were developed at a time when people did not suspect\nthe existence of parallel worlds.\n\nThe mathematical part of the MWI, (i), yields less than mathematical\nparts of some other theories such as Bohmian mechanics. The\nSchr\u00f6dinger equation itself does not explain why we experience\ndefinite results in quantum measurements. In contrast, in Bohmian\nmechanics the mathematical part yields almost everything, and the\nanalog of (ii) is very simple: it is the postulate according to which\nonly the \u201cBohmian positions\u201d (and not the quantum wave)\ncorrespond to our experience. The Bohmian positions of all particles\nyield the familiar picture of the (single) world we are aware of. The\nsimplicity of part (ii) of Bohmian mechanics comes at the price of\nadding problematic physical features to part (i), e.g., the nonlocal\ndynamics of Bohmian trajectories.\n",
