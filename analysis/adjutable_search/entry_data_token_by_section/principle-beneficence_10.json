If the end\nof clinical medicine is healing, which is a goal of beneficence, then\narguably medicine is fundamentally a beneficent undertaking, and\nbeneficence grounds and determines the professional obligations and\nvirtues of the physician. Authors such as Edmund Pellegrino write as if\nbeneficence is the sole foundational principle of professional medical\nethics. In this theory, medical beneficence is oriented exclusively to\nthe end of healing and not to any other form of benefit. The category\nof medical benefits does not, for Pellegrino, include items such as\nproviding fertility controls (unless for the prevention and maintenance\nof health and bodily integrity), performing purely cosmetic surgery, or\nactively helping a patient to effect a merciful death by the active\nhastening of death.\n\n\nThis characterization of the ends of medicine allows Pellegrino to\nlimit severely what counts as a medical benefit for patients: Benefit\nin medicine is limited to healing and related activities such as caring\nfor and preventing injury or disease. This thesis is controversial.\nEven if healing and the like are interpreted broadly, medicine does not\nseem to many in bioethics to have such precise boundaries. If\nbeneficence is a general moral principle and if physicians are\npositioned to supply many forms of benefit, there is no manifest reason\nwhy physicians\u2019 hands are tied to the single benefit of\nhealing, even in their role as medical professionals. The\nrange of benefits that might be considered relevant seems broader and\ncould include prescribing pharmaceutical products or devices that\nprevent fertility (where there is no healing-related purpose),\nproviding cosmetic surgery for strictly aesthetic (by contrast to\nreconstructive) reasons, helping patients write realistic living wills,\ncomplying with terminally ill patients\u2019 requests for\nphysician-assistance in dying by hastening death, and the like. If\nthese are bona fide medical benefits, how far does the range of\nbenefits extend? If a physician runs a company that manufactures\npowered wheel chairs for the elderly, does this activity supply a\nmedical benefit? When physicians consult with an insurance company\nabout cost-effective treatments that save their patients money, is this\nactivity a beneficent component of the practice of medicine?\n\n\nControversy over the ends of medicine requires decisions about what\nis to count as the practice of medicine and, derivatively, what counts\nas medical beneficence. Controversy appears not only in the literature\nof biomedical ethics, but also in some split decisions of the U. S.\nSupreme Court\u2014notably in Gonzales v. Oregon, a case\ndealing with physician-hastened death. The majority decision in this\ncase asserts that there is no consensus among health care professionals\nabout the precise boundaries of the legitimate practice of\nmedicine, a legal notion similar to the medical-ethics notion of\nthe proper ends of medicine. The court notes that there is reasonable\ndisagreement in the community of physicians regarding the appropriate\nprocess for determining the boundaries of medical practice and that\nthere is also reasonable disagreement about the extent to which the\ngovernment should be involved in drawing boundaries when physicians\nthemselves disagree. This court opinion allows that, depending on state\nlaw, a physician may legitimately assist in various ways to help bring\nabout the death of a terminally ill patient who has explicitly and\ncompetently requested this assistance from the physician.\n",
