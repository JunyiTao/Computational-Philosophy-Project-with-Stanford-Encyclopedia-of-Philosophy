    "main_text": "Conception\n2. Conception\n\n\nReid's theory of conception is at the heart of his philosophical\nsystem and his faculty psychology. The term \u2018faculty psychology\u2019\nrefers, at least for Reid, to both the distinction of certain\nbelief-forming systems from others, and the explanatory utility\npurchased with such a set of distinctions. While faculty psychology\nappears to be an obvious way to scientifically study the senses,\nReid's study of intellectual powers\u2014memory, judgment,\nabstraction\u2014under the umbrella of faculty psychology was not\nobvious. Reid would face pointed criticism for multiplying faculties,\nbut this consequence was more than outweighed by the explanatory\nutility of separating mental powers\u2014their inputs, their\noperations, and their outputs\u2014from one another.\n\n  \nThe most ubiquitous mental power is that of conception. Our\nsuite of intellectual faculties supports a wide variety of mental\nevents. Acts of conceiving are embedded in most of them. Whether\njudging that there is a tree before me, imagining there is a tree\nbefore me, or reasoning to a generalization that all trees have roots,\nthese mental events employ the faculty of conception. It is in virtue\nof conception that the first of these mental states is about the\nproposition there is a tree before me; that the second mental state\ntakes as its object a non-existent tree; and that the third uses a\ngeneral conception of \u2018tree\u2019. The Way of Ideas teaches, wrongly, that\nacts of perception temporally begin with an act of simple apprehension\n\u201cand that after we have got simple apprehensions, by comparing\nthem together, we perceive agreements or disagreements between\nthem,\u201d but, Reid continues, \u201cthis appears to me to be all\nfiction, without any foundation in nature\u201d (IHM 2.4,\n29). Instead, simple apprehension\u2014the basic form of\nconception\u2014is bundled within typical acts of perception. The\nmodel of conception received from the Way of Ideas marks its first\nlong step into two types of skepticism.\n\n \nNote that the set of commitments that Reid refers to as \u201cThe Way\nof Ideas\u201d and the \u201cIdeal Theory\u201d is drawn form the\nwork of Locke, Berkeley, Hume and many others going back to Plato and\nAristotle. Its principle commitment is to mental representations,\ncalled \u2018ideas\u2019 or \u2018images\u2019, that are believed\nto mediate all our experience of the world\u2014from conception to\nmemory and perception. Reid regards the Way of Ideas as unscientific\nand founded on a flawed, anti-Newtonian methodology. He also argues\nthat it has highly undesirable consequences.\n",
