    "main_text": "Grounds for Belief in the Existence of God\n4. Grounds for Belief in the Existence of God\n\n\nThe sage proposes to resolve the king's puzzlement by\nmeans of a thought experiment comprised of two hypothetical situations.\nWhile this experiment is ultimately about what counts as sufficient\ngrounds to persuade him of the existence of God as the sage has\ndescribed him, this is neither announced in\nadvance nor immediately obvious from what is said. Accordingly, the\nsage asks the king whether, upon being told that the ruler of India was\na virtuous man and that the people of India also had excellent\ncharacter traits and behaved justly towards one another in all their\ndealings, he would be compelled to revere their ruler and recount his\nexploits with praise. The Khazar king replies that there could hardly\nbe any compelling obligation, if there is doubt about whether the\njustice of India's people was entirely of their own making, and\nthey have no king at all, or whether it really was due to their king,\nafter all, or, finally, whether it was attributable to both. His\nunstated but nonetheless crucial assumption is that, of course, there\nis doubt, because no compelling evidence or argument has been provided\nto establish any of the three alternatives just mentioned.\n\n\nThe second hypothetical case immediately follows. Now the\nking is asked whether he would be obligated to obey the ruler of India,\nif he were to be visited by his messenger, who brought with him gifts\ntypical of India and specifically of its royal palaces, a message\nsigned by the king himself, as well as medicines to cure his illnesses\nand preserve his health, and poisons by which to prevail over his\nenemies. The king's reply is unqualifiedly affirmative, and he\nimmediately explains why. His previous doubt about whether India really\nhad a king would have been dispelled, and he would believe that both\nhis dominion and his order extend to include him. When the sage then\nasks the king how he would then describe the Indian king he has never\nmet, he responds in a way that clearly recalls his earlier remarks\nabout natural scientists confronted by unexplained phenomena. He says\nthat he would describe him, first, in terms of attributes based on\ndirect observation, and then in terms of other attributes that are both\ngenerally accepted and plainly applicable because of those based on\nobservation.\n\n\nIt is only after the king has expressed himself in this way\nthat the sage begins to suggest that the entire thought experiment is\nparabolical and that the king has, in effect, endorsed the rationality\nand appropriateness of the sage's opening remarks. The\nendorsement was in his having responded to the unanticipated diplomatic\nmission to his court with all its concomitant benefits just as the\nbiblical Israelites responded to the unanticipated mission and\nextraordinary benefits that came their way, which by their very nature\nlaid the foundation for a special relationship. By providing additional\nexamples about how God is known to be real only from experience or from\nuninterrupted tradition which is deemed equivalent to it, rather than\nfrom the tenuous and inconclusive arguments associated with\nsyllogistic, governmental religions, both the king and the reader are\nleft to work out the specific correspondences between the two\nhypothetical cases and the claims of philosophy on the one hand, and\nrevealed religion on the other. Even a cursory reading, however,\nestablishes that in both parts of the thought experiment, the king of\nIndia represents God, and India, the divine realm. In the first\nhypothetical case, the justice of India's people seems to\nrepresent either a pervasive, intelligible aspect of the cosmos (e.g.,\nmotion, causation) which serves as the starting point of cosmological\narguments generally, or, more specifically, evidence of intelligent\nordering, on which design arguments are typically based. The possible\nexplanations for the justice that prevails would presumably correspond\nto various philosophical and theological positions that remain to be\nidentified. The key point is that the Khazar king recognizes that there\nis no compelling evidence or argument to establish that the justice of\nIndia's people is due to their king or that they even have a\nking. Hence, he suspends judgment. In the second hypothetical case, it\nis clear that the messenger of the king of India is\neither an angel or a prophet, that the signed letter is most likely the\nrevealed Law, which repeatedly presents God, using his proper name, as\nits author, and that the medicinal gifts are the divine commandments.\nHowever the other elements of the parable might be understood, the key\npoint is that, based on the empirical evidence presented to him, the\nking is not only prepared to acknowledge the existence of the king of\nIndia, but also to recognize the authority of his dominion and obey his\norder. In effect, the diplomatic mission which the second hypothetical\ncase describes creates a sense of indebtedness and obligation on the\npart of the recipient which lays the groundwork for a special\nrelationship, such as that of a suzerain and vassal or patron and\nclient. As the dialogue proceeds, it will be helpful to keep in mind\nboth this brief reference to the Indian king's dominion and order\nas well as the apparently insignificant fact that the king's\nrepresentative comes from India.\n",
