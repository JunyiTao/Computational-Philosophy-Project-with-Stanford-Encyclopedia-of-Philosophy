    "main_text": "\n\nLiberal political discourse was dominant in Latin America during most\nof the nineteenth century. Initially, in the first half of the\ncentury, it was a discourse of liberation from colonial rule in\nHispanic America. Liberal ideas provided the political language to\narticulate the urgently needed new kind of legitimacy for the emerging\nrepublics. Later, in the second half, liberalism was firmly\nestablished as an ideology of nation building in most of the region.\nHowever, by the mid twentieth century, liberalism had mostly vanished\nfrom the political scene, except in Colombia where the liberal party\ncontinued to be a live political option until the end of the century.\nDespite the fact that it became the dominant political discourse in\nthe nineteenth century, there is no such thing as Latin American or\nHispanic American \u201cliberalism\u201d, if by the latter we mean\nsomething like a unified and internally coherent body of political\ndoctrine (\u201cHispanic American\u201d refers to Spanish-speaking\nAmerica as opposed to Portuguese speaking, i.e., Brazil). Instead,\nwhat emerged in the nineteenth century were various political\nmovements that can appropriately be called \u201cliberal\u201d to\nthe extent that political actors either espoused liberal ideas or\nidentified themselves as \u201cliberals\u201d, or both. Though such\npolitical movements began to take shape in the aftermath of the wars\nof independence from Spain and Portugal, self-identification as a\nmember of a liberal group became possible around the mid-century when\nthe liberal position became more definite in relation to usually\n\u201cconservative\u201d adversaries.\n\nA central feature of Hispanic American liberalism (the case of Brazil\nis considered below) is that its multiple variants developed directly\nin response to the political challenges posed by the need to construct\nnew states after the disintegration of the Spanish empire. Liberal\npolitical actors were primarily concerned with addressing\ninstitutional issues and also with pressing for specific political\nends but not with systematic theorizing. Liberal intellectuals were\npublic figures who usually held official positions and were mainly\nconcerned with the practical tasks of constitutional design and\ninstitutional reform. Thus, the various liberal positions principally\nemerged in political and legal practice, not in theoretical works.\nLiberal intellectuals expressed and developed their views in the\nnumerous constitutions that they produced, in legal commentary, and in\nthe public debates that took place in pamphlets and newspapers. For\nthis reason, it is crucial to understand the political challenges that\nthey were forced to confront in the design of the new institutional\nstructures. The various liberal positions that they developed can only\nbe fully grasped as responses to the questions and problems that the\nsocial and political situations forced upon them. This is not to deny\nthat some liberal Latin American intellectuals did produce theoretical\nworks that are worth examining in their own right, such as those by\nJuan Bautista Alberdi in Argentina and Jos\u00e9 Victorino Lastarria\nin Chile.\n\nDespite important differences in the social and political conditions\nacross the region, liberal Hispanic American intellectuals shared some\ncommon themes and concerns. Chief among them was their commitment to\ncarry out a radical break with the past that required the profound\ntransformation of their own societies. Central to this enterprise was\nthe replacement of the religiously grounded monarchical form of\ngovernment with secular republics based on popular sovereignty. In\nlight of this commitment, liberal political actors debated how best to\ncarry out this transformation in political structures and social\npractices: whether constitutional design could be sufficient to\nproduce the desired republican order (i.e., non-monarchical) with full\nprotection of individual liberties and a market economy; or whether it\nwas also necessary to engage in social and economic reform with the\npower of a strong centralized State that was still in the making. They\nasked what was to be done with inherited colonial institutions that\nfiercely resisted the new liberal order (especially the Catholic\nChurch); and how to transform ex-colonial subjects with little if any\nexperience in political representation and participation in a market\neconomy into industrious citizens of the republic. A central\nconcern was how to maintain social and political stability in the\nprocess of a deep transformation premised on the rejection of long\nestablished colonial institutional structures and social practices.\nNot surprisingly, liberal political actors disagreed deeply among\nthemselves about how best to answer questions such as these and what\nexactly liberalism entailed. They disagreed on matters of\nconstitutional design, the extent of individual liberties, the proper\nfunctions of the State, who was entitled to full active citizenship,\nhow to deal with the Catholic Church, among other issues. For all\ntheir disagreements, they took for granted that the\n\u201cIndians\u201d and mestizos, who were in the majority, had to\nbe transformed into industrious citizens, by force if\nnecessary.\n\nWhile the reconstruction of nineteenth century Latin American\nliberalism has been dominated by historians, it is also of\nphilosophical interest for at least two reasons. First, the most\nprominent liberal intellectuals, such as Juan Bautista Alberdi in\nArgentina, Jos\u00e9 Mar\u00eda Luis Mora in Mexico, and\nJos\u00e9 Victorino Lastarria in Chile, did develop distinctive\nliberal positions. As already mentioned, Alberdi and Lastarria also\nproduced theoretical works in which they systematized their own\npolitical views. Second, the consideration of nineteenth century Latin\nAmerican liberalism can contribute to enrich our understanding of\nliberalism as a far more internally heterogeneous ideology than is\nusually assumed since what was meant by \u201cliberalism\u201d turns\nout to be sometimes surprising from contemporary perspectives. For\nnineteenth century Latin American liberals the liberal State could be\nthe main agent promoting economic growth, the principal provider of\nformal schooling, and the champion of political and social\nsecularization in constant confrontation with the Catholic Church.\n\nDespite their lofty ambitions, the struggles of political actors to\ntransform Latin American societies in light of liberal ideas and\nvalues have almost unanimously been met with a harsh judgement. Since\nearly on in the nineteenth century, there emerged the concern that\nliberal ideas were \u201cimported\u201d and inadequate for Latin\nAmerican societies (Bol\u00edvar 1815). Later, in the early\ntwentieth, the discourse that liberalism had been a failure in the\nregion enjoyed ample support given the oligarchical nature of the\nliberal regimes, the establishment of authoritarian\n\u201cliberal\u201d governments, and the inability of the liberal\nestablishments to properly channel social demands for political\nparticipation and the inclusion of the large impoverished majorities\nin the benefits of economic growth. Since then, scholars have debated\non the alleged inadequacy of Latin American societies for liberal\ninstitutions, the ways in which the \u201cadaptation\u201d of\nliberalism in Latin American allegedly \u201cdeviated\u201d from the\n\u201coriginal\u201d European and North American liberal\n\u201cmodels\u201d, and the \u201cforeign\u201d nature of the\nlatter.\n\nHowever, in recent decades there has taken place a renewed scholarly\ninterest in nineteenth century Latin American liberalism and local\npolitical history more broadly. Novel theoretical approaches have\ncalled into question well-established assumptions. Some authors have\nshifted attention from diagnosing the failures of liberalism in the\nregion to offering more sympathetic and accurate reconstructions (Hale\n1968 & 1989, J\u00e1ksic and Posada Carb\u00f3 2011). This\ndevelopment has opened a number of conceptual debates in an evolving\nfield. Scholars now disagree as to what is to count as\n\u201cliberalism\u201d in carrying out this reconstruction. While\nsome maintain that such a reconstruction necessarily presupposes a\nprior theoretical \u201cdefinition\u201d of liberalism in order to\nproperly identify its subject matter (Aguilar 2000 & 2010,\nGargarella 2010 & 2013), others reject all attempts at definition\naltogether (Palti 2005 & 2007). The question then arises whether\nany position that political actors called \u201cliberal\u201d is to\ncount as such for scholarly purposes. For instance, Is the fusion of\nlate nineteenth century liberalism with Comtean positivism that took\nplace in some regions to be considered a genuine liberal development?\nOr should it be considered the demise of liberalism despite the fact\nthat some of those who embraced positivism continued to call\nthemselves \u201cliberals\u201d? What should be the subject matter\nin this reconstruction: the uses of the term \u201cliberal\u201d\n(Rivera-Castro 2021), the concept of \u201cliberalism\u201d\nregardless of the terminology that political actors and movements in\nfact employed (Fern\u00e1ndez Sebasti\u00e1n 2009 & 2012), or\nthe political languages in which they articulated their own views\n(Palti 2005 & 2007)? These debates have brought to the fore that\nthe reconstruction of nineteenth century Latin American liberalism\nposes conceptual and methodologiacl questions regarding what we are to\nunderstand by \u201cliberal\u201d and \u201cliberalism\u201d both\nat the early stage around the time of independence and at the time of\nthe liberll triumph in the closing decades of the century. The\nquestion even arises whether the attribution of a liberal ideology to\npolitical actors at the early stage before the formation of political\ngroups that self-identified as \u201cliberal\u201d is appropriate or\nonly a retrospective reconstruction.\n\nIn light of the variety and complexity of Latin American liberal\nviews, this entry provides only a brief and general introduction to\nthe topic that is far from being the whole story. Since the heyday of\nLatin American liberalism took place in the nineteenth century, this\nentry privileges this historical period, though the last section\nfocuses on the decline of liberalism in the twentieth century, its\nmodest revival in recent decades, and current scholarly debates on how\nbest to carry out its reconstruction. In order to adequately present\nthe liberal political movements, it has been indispensable to provide\nthe highlights of the social and political context that motivated the\ninitial enthusiastic appropriation of liberal ideas as well as their\nfurther development. This entry also provides closer though brief\napproximations to the views developed by the most prominent liberal\nintellectuals mentioned earlier, namely, Alberdi, Mora, and Lastarria.\nSince they articulated their positions in quite different political\ncontexts, their respective liberal views differ greatly from each\nother. Though the entry is organized thematically, it also roughly\nfollows a chronological order. The first section offers a brief\noverview. The second section presents the influence of Spanish\nliberalism in the initial reception of liberal ideas around the time\nof the wars of independence in the early nineteenth century. The third\nsection presents early Hispanic American liberalism as an emancipatory\nideology that commanded wide acceptance among the elites. The fourth\nsection considers the transition from the initial constitutional\noptimism to the search for alternative ways for bringing about the\nmuch desired social and political change. The fifth section focuses on\nthe ideological conflict between liberals and conservatives around the\nmid-nineteenth century. It was in the midst of this conflict that the\ncontours of a liberal political identity came more clearly into view.\nThe sixth section presents the liberal anticlerical response to the\nreligious problem. The seventh section considers the influence of\npositivism and the triumph of liberalism as an ideology of nation\nbuilding. The final eighth section briefly considers the decline of\nliberalism in the early decades of the twentieth century, the debates\non the alleged failure of liberalism in Latin America, and the related\ndiscussions regarding the adequate conceptual framework for carrying\nout its reconstruction.\n",
