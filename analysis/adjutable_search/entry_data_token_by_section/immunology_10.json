    "main_text": "Immunology\u2019s Social Dimensions\n6. Conclusion\n\nTwo conceptual shifts that have marked contemporary research in\nimmunology have influenced philosophical comment on various topics in\nbiology. The first is a major revision in how the mechanics of\nimmunity are conceived. Taking account of the context in which the\nimmune reaction is regulated, the earlier conception of immune\nspecificity as arising from some simple mechanical lock and key\nmatching between selected antibodies binding to noxious antigens has\nbeen replaced with collectivist models of molecular interactions. In\naccounting for the frequency and intensity of an immune encounter,\nthis dynamic orientation portrays the immune system as a sensor of\nchange rather than structure. The sensitivity of such a\ncognitive system that must mediate multifarious immune reactions\nrequires a co-ordination of collective molecular ensembles,\nin which diverse elements together determine the extent of the immune\nresponse (Da\u00ebron 2014). Indeed, only through modulated responses\ncan immunity fulfill its diverse functions, some of which require\ntolerance of recognized substances and others full blown activation of\nrejection. Accordingly, immune theory has departed from the classical,\nself/nonself framework that depicts the immune response as a simple\n\u201con\u201d and \u201coff\u201d binary switch, to multifaceted\nmodels that account for a spectrum of reactivities.\n\nThe second conceptual shift addresses how immunity mediates the\ninteractions of the organism with its environment. That ecological\norientation has inflected immunology from its earlier insular\nconceptions of the organism to a dynamic interactive view that\nhighlights how life experience alters the immune response to external\nchallenges and opportunities. With this broadened perspective, the\nidea of immunity extends beyond defense of an atomistic\nindividual, to include the mediation of the organism\u2019s\necological economy, both defensive and assimilative. This includes the\ninternal environment as well, inasmuch as the microbiome, established\nthrough immune niche formation, has increasingly focused attention on\nthe prevalence of immune tolerance, symbiosis, and the biology\ncharacterized by cooperative relationships of various sorts (Eberl\n2010; Bilate and LaFaille 2012).\n\nIn short, the philosophical challenge of defining immune identity is\nframed by differing orientations, namely, autonomous individuality\nversus collective ensemble (both applicable to the regulation of the\nimmune response and contextual placement in the environment). Which\nversion chosen then leads to strikingly different answers to\nimmunology\u2019s key questions: \n\n What is immunity; \n what are the defining characteristics of individuality as\ndetermined immunologically; \n what are the epistemological standing of immune selfhood and the\nrhetorical uses of agency in its various forms (literal, metaphoric,\nand idiomatic); \n how has the cognitive paradigm framed immune processes as an\ninformation processing system; and \n how might biological causation of the immune system studied as a\nwhole be modeled? \n\n\nEach of these issues directly pertains to philosophical considerations\nabout the character of the organism, the relationships of parts to the\nwhole, principles of biological organization and regulation, the\nconstruction of cognitive schemas, and the ability of models to\ncapture complex organic functions.\n\nIn conclusion, although firmly embedded in philosophy of biology and\nengaging in closely related concerns, the philosophy of immunology has\nbecome an established discipline with distinctive interests and\ncontributions. The immunological matters of interest to philosophers\ndo not always overlap with those that dominate immunology\u2019s\ncontemporary research program. This divergence highlights how\nphilosophy of immunology has emerged as an autonomous field with its\nown subjects of attention and methods of inquiry that complement\nrather than mimic or replicate the pursuits in related areas of\ntheoretical and experimental immunology. Moreover, philosophical\nstudies of immunology have contributed to a wide range of pivotal\ntopics engaged by philosophers of biology\u2014organismal identity;\nindividuality; dynamic causation in complex systems (integrating\ncomplexity theory with big data studies); the characterization of the\ngoals and methods of systems biology; the organization of information;\nthe characterization of the normative and deviant; and personal\nontology (self). Each of these areas of research impact other\nbiological disciplines of interest to philosophers, i.e., development,\necology, genetics, evolution and cognition. And beyond the purview of\nphilosophy of biology, studies of immunology contribute to the more\ngeneral discussions of reductionism/anti-reductionism, theory change\nand conceptual modeling, and social and cultural studies of science\n(i.e., the function of metaphors in science, the role of a scientific\ndiscourse). In sum, a rich two-way traffic between philosophers of\nimmunology and philosophers of science has emerged that allows the\nformer to use tried-and-tested conceptual tools developed by their\ncolleagues, while providing a unique outlook for the latter. Given the\ncentrality of immunology in modern biology and the unique perspective\noffered by this science on crucial philosophical problems, further\nengagement not only seems likely, but an imperative for philosophy of\nscience writ large. \n",
