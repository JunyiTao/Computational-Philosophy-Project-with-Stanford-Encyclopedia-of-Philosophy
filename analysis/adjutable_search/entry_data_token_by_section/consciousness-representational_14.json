    "main_text": "Objections to the Representational Theory || Unconscious Representation\n4.2 Unconscious Representation\n\nSturgeon (2000), Kriegel (2002a) and Chalmers (2004) argue that\nrepresentation cannot suffice for a sensory quality (or for there\nbeing something it is like for the subject to do the representing, but\nthat is not our topic for now), because representation can occur\nunconsciously. This appears to refute pure representationalism, since\naccording to that view representation of the relevant sort of property\ndoes necessarily constitute a sensory quality. The point is not highly\nsignificant, since as before, pure representationalism is an\nunoccupied position. The real question is, whether the concern behind\nthis objection carries over to \u201cquasi-\u201d or other strong\nrepresentationalism.\n\nSturgeon does seem to hold the stronger view that not even\nrepresentation of whatever special sort is appealed to by the\nquasi-representationalist can suffice for a sensory quality, because\nany such representation can occur unconsciously. Since the\nquasi-representationalist maintains precisely that a sensory quality\nis simply a representatum of the relevant sort, this would be an\noutright refutation.\n\nThis objection rests on the crucial assumption that sensory qualities\ncan occur only consciously. That assumption shares the usual multiple\nambiguity of \u201cconscious.\u201d The interpretation on which the\nobjection\u2019s premise is most obviously true is that of sense (1)\nor sense (2) above: Representation can occur without its\nsubject\u2019s being aware of it, and/or without the subject\u2019s\nintrospecting it. But if we then understand the tacit assumption in\nthe same way, it would be independently rejected by most\nrepresentationalists, who already hold that a sensory quality can\noccur without being noticed by its host. (Consider the driver driving\n\u201con autopilot\u201d who obviously saw the red light, and saw\nits redness in particular, but who was daydreaming and quite unaware\nof the redness, or even of applying the brake.) If, rather, sense (3)\nis intended, the assumption would be fine, because tautologous (a\nquality cannot occur without a quality occurring); but the\nobjection\u2019s premise would be, in effect, a flat and\nquestion-begging denial of strong representationalism, saying that the\nrelevant representation can occur without a sensory quality\noccurring.\n\nWhat of sense (4)? Here the objection gets a slightly better foothold.\nThe premise is true; representation can occur without there being\nsomething that representing is like for the subject. And there is at\nleast a sense of the phrase \u201cwhat it\u2019s like\u201d in\nwhich the tacit assumption is true also: Recall that some theorists\nhave used that phrase simply to mean a sensory quality (in sense (3));\nso again the assumption would be tautologous. But the present concern\nis for sense (4), and at this point the objection breaks down. For so\nfar as has been shown, a (first-order) quality can occur without there\nbeing anything it is like for the subject to experience that quality\non that occasion; the subject may be entirely unaware of it.\n\nIn virtue of what, then, does an experience contain, or have inhering\nwithin it, a sensory quality? The representationalist\u2019s answer\nis, in virtue of representing that quality in a distinctive way. What\nare distinctive about that mode of representation are (a) the\nfunctional considerations needed to specify the relevant sense\nmodality, and (b) assuming \u201cexperience\u201d implies\nawareness of the sensory quality, whatever is called for by\none\u2019s account of awareness-of.\n",
