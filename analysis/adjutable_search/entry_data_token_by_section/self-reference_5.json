    "main_text": "Paradoxes of Self-Reference || Paradoxes without Self-Reference\n1.6 Paradoxes without Self-Reference\n\nIn 1985, Yablo succeeded in constructing a semantic paradox that does\nnot involve self-reference in the strict sense. Instead, it consists\nof an infinite chain of sentences, each sentence expressing the\nuntruth of all the subsequent ones. More precisely, for each natural\nnumber \\(i\\) we define \\(S_i\\) to be the\nsentence \u201cfor all \\(j\\gt i,\nS_j\\) is not true\u201d. We can then derive\na contradiction as follows:\n\n\nFirst we prove that none of the sentences\n\\(S_i\\) can be true. Assume to obtain a\ncontradiction that \\(S_i\\) is true for some\n\\(i\\). Then it is true that \u201cfor all\n\\(j\\gt i, S_j\\) is not\ntrue\u201d. Thus none of the sentences\n\\(S_j\\) for \\(j\\gt i\\) are true.\nIn particular, \\(S_{i+1}\\) is not true.\n\\(S_{i+1}\\) is the sentence \u201cfor all\n\\(j\\gt i+1, S_j\\) is not\ntrue\u201d. Since this sentence is not true, there must be some\n\\(k\\gt i+1\\) for which \\(S_k\\)\nis true. However, this contradicts that none of the sentences\n\\(S_j\\) with \\(j\\gt i\\) are\ntrue.\n\nWe have now proved that none of the sentences\n\\(S_i\\) are true. Then, in particular, we have\nthat for all \\(j\\gt 0\\), S\\(_j\\) is not true. This\nis exactly what is expressed by S\\(_0\\), so S\\(_0\\) must\nbe true. This is again a contradiction.\n\n\nYablo calls this paradox the \\(\\omega\\)-liar, but others usually\nrefer to it as Yablo\u2019s paradox. Note that none of the\nsentences \\(S_i\\) refer to themselves (not\neven indirectly), but only to the ones that occur later in the\nsequence. Yablo\u2019s paradox is semantic, but as shown by Yablo\n(2006), similar set-theoretic paradoxes involving no self-reference\ncan be formulated in certain set theories. \n\nYablo\u2019s paradox demonstrates that we can have logical paradoxes\nwithout self-reference\u2014only a certain kind of\nnon-wellfoundedness is needed to obtain a contradiction. There are\nobviously structural differences between the ordinary paradoxes of\nself-reference and Yablo\u2019s paradox: The ordinary paradoxes of\nself-reference involve a cyclic structure of reference, whereas\nYablo\u2019s paradox involve an acyclic, but non-wellfounded,\nstructure of reference. More precisely, the referential structure in\nself-referential paradoxes such as the liar is a reflexive relation on\na singleton set (a cycle), whereas the referential structure in\nYablo\u2019s paradox is isomorphic to the usual less-than ordering on\nthe natural numbers, which is a strict total order (contains no\ncycles). Even though there is this difference, Yablo\u2019s paradox\nstill share most properties with the ordinary paradoxes of\nself-reference. When solving paradoxes we might thus choose to\nconsider them all under one, and refer to them as paradoxes of\nnon-wellfoundedness. In the following we will however stick to\nthe term paradoxes of self-reference, even though most of\nwhat we say will apply to Yablo\u2019s paradox and related paradoxes\nof non-wellfoundedness as well.\n\nGiven the insight that not only cyclic structures of reference can\nlead to paradox, but also certain types of non-wellfounded structures,\nit becomes interesting to study further these structures of reference\nand their potential in characterising the necessary and sufficient\nconditions for paradoxicality. This line of work was initiated by\nGaifman (1988, 1992, 2000), and later pursued by Cook (2004), Walicki\n(2009) and others.\n\nSignificant amounts of newer work on self-reference has gone into\ntrying to make a complete graph-theoretical characterisation of which\nstructures of reference admit paradoxes, including Rabern and Macauley\n(2013), Cook (2014) and Dyrkolbotn and Walicki (2014). A complete\ncharacterisation is still an open problem (Rabern, Rabern and\nMacauley, 2013), but it seems to be a relatively widespread conjecture\nthat all paradoxical graphs of reference are either cyclic or contain\na Yablo-like structure. If this conjecture turns out to be true, it\nwould mean that in terms of structure of reference, all paradoxes of\nreference are either liar-like or Yablo-like. The precise\ncharacterisation of what it means to be a \u201cYablo-like\nstructure\u201d is still discussed.\n\nEven though the structure of reference involved in Yablo\u2019s\nparadox does not contain any cycles (each sentence only refers to\nlater sentences in the sequence), it is still being discussed whether\nthe paradox is self-referential or not (Cook, 2014; Halbach and Zhang,\n2017). Yablo (1993) himself argues that it is non-self-referential,\nwhereas Priest (1997) argues that it is self-referential. Butler\n(2017) claims that even if Priest is correct, there will be other\nYablo-like paradoxes that are not self-referential in the sense of\nPriest. In the analysis of Yablo\u2019s paradox, it is essential to\nnote that it involves an infinite sequence of sentences,\nwhere each sentence refers to infinitely many other\nsentences. To formalise it in a setting of propositional logic, it is\nhence necessary to use infinitary propositional logic. Any finitary\nvariant of Yablo\u2019s sequence\u2014where every sentence only\nrefers to finitely many later sentences in the sequence\u2014must\nnecessarily be consistent (non-paradoxical) due to the compactness\ntheorem in propositional logic (every finite subset of sentences in\nthe sequence induces a well-founded reference relation and the\nsentences can hence consistently be assigned truth-values bottom-up).\nIn finitary first- and second-order arithmetic, one can instead\nattempt to formalise Yablo\u2019s paradox by a unary predicate\n\\(S(x)\\) where, for every natural numbers \\(i\\),\n\\(S(\\inumeral)\\) represents the formalisation of the \\(i\\)th\nsentence \\(S_i\\) of the Yablo sequence (where\n\\(\\inumeral\\) is the numeral representing \\(i)\\). How and\nwhether the Yablo paradox can truthfully be represented this way, and\nhow it relates to compactness of the underlying logic, has been\ninvestigated by Picollo (2013). \n\nYablo\u2019s paradox has also inspired the creation of similar\nparadoxes involving non-wellfounded, acyclic structures of reference\nin other areas than truth, e.g. the \u201cYabloesque\u201d variant\nof the Brandenburger-Keisler paradox of epistemic game theory by\nBa\u015fkent (2016), a variant concerning provability by Cie\u015bli\u0144ski and\nUrbaniak (2013), and a variant in the context of G\u00f6del\u2019s\nincompleteness theorems by Leach-Krouse (2014).\n",
