    "main_text": "\n\nMoral relativism is an important topic in metaethics. It is also\nwidely discussed outside philosophy (for example, by political and\nreligious leaders), and it is controversial among philosophers and\nnonphilosophers alike. This is perhaps not surprising in view of\nrecent evidence that people\u2019s intuitions about moral relativism\nvary widely. Though many philosophers are quite critical of moral\nrelativism, there are several contemporary philosophers who defend\nforms of it. These include such prominent figures as Gilbert Harman,\nJesse J. Prinz, J. David Velleman and David B. Wong. The term\n\u2018moral relativism\u2019 is understood in a variety of ways.\nMost often it is associated with an empirical thesis that there are\ndeep and widespread moral disagreements and a metaethical thesis that\nthe truth or justification of moral judgments is not absolute, but\nrelative to the moral standard of some person or group of persons.\nSometimes \u2018moral relativism\u2019 is connected with a normative\nposition about how we ought to think about or act towards those with\nwhom we morally disagree, most commonly that we should tolerate\nthem.\n",
