Traditional Versions of Neutral Monism\n\nBaruch Spinoza (1632\u201377) and David Hume (1711\u201376) are\noften identified as the originators of neutral\n monism.[4]\n The case for including Spinoza runs as follows:\n\nSpinoza\u2019s metaphysics of substance has been called neutral\nmonism; it is a form of monism because it allows for only one\nsubstance, and it is neutral because he describes the one substance as\nboth a body and a mind. (Rosenkrantz and Hoffman 2011: 287)\n\n\nTo classify Spinoza as an existence monist may be permissible. But the\nneutrality claim is based on the problematical both view of\nneutrality. This suggests that it is best to classify Spinoza as a\ndouble aspect theorist. Hume\u2019s case is more difficult to assess.\nIt has been said that the prevalent 20th century\ninterpretation of Hume has been neutral monist (see Flage 1982: 527).\nH.H. Price\u2019s case for this view has been particularly\ninfluential (see Price 1932: 105\u20136). On the other hand, the\nneutral monist interpretation of Hume has been vigorously resisted\n(Flage 1982; Backhaus 1991).\n\nIn light of these difficulties it is best to start the genealogy of\nneutral monism with the big three: Ernst Mach, William James,\nand Bertrand Russell. Of the three, only Russell uses the label\n\u201cneutral monism\u201d (a term seemingly coined by his teacher\nJames\n Ward).[5]\n But there is widespread agreement that Mach, James, and Russell are\nthe three most important philosophers in this tradition. A striking\nfeature of traditional neutral monism\u2014a reflection of the\nempiricist leanings of its protagonists\u2014is the close tie between\nthe neutral entities and experience. This connection has given rise to\none of the most enduring criticisms of neutral monism: that it\ncollapses into phenomenalism. It is therefore important to note that\nthis salient feature of traditional neutral monism need be no part of\nit.\n",
