We live\nmost of our lives in communities, similar to lions who live in social\ngroups rather than individualistic tigers who live alone most of the\ntime. Those communities shape, and ought to shape, our moral and\npolitical judgments and we have a strong obligation to support and\nnourish the particular communities that provide meaning for our lives,\nwithout which we\u2019d be disoriented, deeply lonely, and incapable of\ninformed moral and political judgment.\n\nCommunitarian ideas have a long history, in the West, China, and\nelsewhere, but modern-day communitarianism began in the upper reaches\nof Anglo-American academia in the form of a critical reaction to John\nRawls\u2019 landmark 1971 book A Theory of Justice (Rawls\n1971). Drawing primarily upon the insights of Aristotle and Hegel,\npolitical philosophers such as Alasdair MacIntyre, Michael Sandel,\nCharles Taylor and Michael Walzer disputed Rawls\u2019 assumption\nthat the principal task of government is to secure and distribute\nfairly the liberties and economic resources individuals need to lead\nfreely chosen lives. These critics of liberal theory never did\nidentify themselves with the communitarian movement (the communitarian\nlabel was pinned on them by others, usually\ncritics),[1]\nmuch less offer a grand communitarian theory as a systematic\nalternative to liberalism. Nonetheless, certain core arguments meant\nto contrast with liberalism\u2019s devaluation of community recur in\nthe works of the four theorists named above (Avineri & de-Shalit\n1992, Bell 1993, Berten et al. 1997, Mulhall & Swift\n1996, and Rasmussen 1990), and for purposes of clarity one can\ndistinguish between claims of three sorts: methodological claims about\nthe importance of tradition and social context for moral and political\nreasoning, ontological or metaphysical claims about the social nature\nof the self, and normative claims about the value of\ncommunity.[2]\n\nThis essay is therefore divided in three parts, and for each part I\npresent the main communitarian claims, followed by an argument (in\neach part) that philosophical concerns in the 1980s have largely given\nway to the political concerns that motivated much of the communitarian\ncritique in the first place.\n", "toc": [{"#UniVerPar": "1.

Universalism Versus Particularism\n\nCommunitarians have sought to deflate the universal pretensions of\nliberal theory. The main target has been Rawls description of the\noriginal position as an \u201cArchimedean point\u201d from which the\nstructure of a social system can be appraised, a position whose\nspecial virtue is that it allows us to regard the human condition\n\u201cfrom the perspective of\n eternity\u201d,[3]\n from all social and temporal points of view. Whereas Rawls seemed to\npresent his theory of justice as universally true, communitarians\nargued that the standards of justice must be found in forms of life\nand traditions of particular societies and hence can vary from context\nto context. Alasdair MacIntyre and Charles Taylor argued that moral\nand political judgment will depend on the language of reasons and the\ninterpretive framework within which agents view their world, hence\nthat it makes no sense to begin the political enterprise by\nabstracting from the interpretive dimensions of human beliefs,\npractices, and institutions (Taylor 1985, ch. 1; MacIntyre 1978,\nchs.18\u201322 and 1988, ch.1; Benhabib 1992, pp. 23\u201338, 89n4).\nMichael Walzer developed the additional argument that effective social\ncriticism must derive from and resonate with the habits and traditions\nof actual people living in specific times and places. Even if there is\nnothing problematic about a formal procedure of universalizability\nmeant to yield a determinate set of human goods and values, \u201cany\nsuch set would have to be considered in terms so abstract that they\nwould be of little use in thinking about particular\ndistributions\u201d (Walzer 1983, 8; Young 1990, 4). In short,\nliberals who ask what is just by abstracting from particular social\ncontexts are doomed to philosophical incoherence and liberal theorists\nwho adopt this method to persuade people to do the just thing are\ndoomed to political irrelevance.\n\nRawls has since tried to eliminate the universalist presuppositions\nfrom his theory. In Political Liberalism, (Rawls 1993) he\nargues in a communitarian vein that his conception of the person as\nimpartial citizen provides the best account of liberal-democratic\npolitical culture and that his political aim is only to work out the\nrules for consensus in political communities where people are willing\nto try for consensus. In the Law of Peoples, (Rawls 1999) he\nexplicitly allows for the possibility that liberalism may not be\nexportable at all times and places, sketching a vision of a\n\u201cdecent, well-ordered society\u201d that liberal societies must\ntolerate in the international realm. Such a society, he argues, need\nnot be democratic, but it must be non-aggressive towards other\ncommunities, and internally it must have a \u201ccommon good\nconception of justice\u201d, a \u201creasonable consultation\nhierarchy\u201d, and it must secure basic human rights. Having said\nthat, one still gets the sense that the liberal vision laid out in\nA Theory of Justice is the best possible political ideal, one\nthat all rational individuals would want if they were able to choose\nbetween the available political alternatives. There may be justifiable\nnon-liberal regimes, but these should be regarded as second best to be\ntolerated and perhaps respected, not idealized or emulated.\n\nOther liberal theorists have taken a harder line against communitarian\nconcessions, arguing that liberal theory can and should present itself\nas a universally valid ideal. Brian Barry, for one, opens his widely\ncited book Justice as Impartiality by boldly affirming the\nuniversality of his theory: \u201cI continue to believe in the\npossibility of putting forward a universally valid case in favor of\nliberal egalitarian principles\u201d (Barry 1995, 3). Barry does\nrecognize that a theory of justice must be anchored in substantive\nmoral considerations, but his normative vision appears to be limited\nto the values and practices of liberal Western societies. He seems\ndistinctly uninterested in learning anything worthwhile from\nnon-Western political traditions: for example, his discussion of\nthings Chinese is confined to brief criticisms of the Cultural\nRevolution and the traditional practice of foot-binding. One might\nconsider the reaction to a Chinese intellectual who puts forward a\nuniversal theory of justice that draws on the Chinese political\ntradition for inspiration and completely ignores the history and moral\nargumentation in Western societies, except for brief criticisms of\nslavery and imperialism.\n\nStill, it must be conceded that 1980s communitarian theorists were\nless-than-successful at putting forward attractive visions of\nnon-liberal societies. The communitarian case for pluralism for the\nneed to respect and perhaps learn from non-liberal societies that may\nbe as good as, if not better than, the liberal societies of the West\nmay have been unintentionally undermined by their own use of (counter)\nexamples. In After Virtue, Alasdair MacIntyre defended the\nAristotelian ideal of the intimate, reciprocating local community\nbound by shared ends, where people simply assume and fulfill socially\ngiven roles (MacIntyre 1984). But this pre-modern Gemeinschaft\nconception of an all-encompassing community that members\nunreflectively endorse seemed distinctly ill-suited for complex and\nconflict-ridden large-scale industrialized societies. In Spheres\nof Justice, Michael Walzer pointed to the Indian caste system,\n\u201cwhere the social meanings are integrated and\nhierarchical\u201d (Walzer 1983, 313) as an example of a non-liberal\nsociety that may be just according to its own standards. Not\nsurprisingly, few readers were inspired by this example of non-liberal\njustice (not to mention the fact that many contemporary Indian\nthinkers view the caste system as an unfortunate legacy of the past\nthat Indians should strive hard to overcome). In short, this use of\nill-informed examples may have unintentionally reinforced the view\nthat there are few if any justifiable alternatives to liberalism in\nmodern societies. Communitarians could score some theoretical points\nby urging liberal thinkers to be cautious about developing universal\narguments founded exclusively on the moral argumentation and political\nexperience of Western liberal societies, but few thinkers would really\ncontemplate the possibility of non-liberal practices appropriate for\nthe modern world so long as the alternatives to liberalism consisted\nof Golden Ages, caste societies, fascism, or actually-existing\ncommunism. For the communitarian critique of liberal universalism to\nhave any lasting credibility, thinkers need to provide compelling\ncounter-examples to modern-day liberal-democratic regimes and 1980s\ncommunitarians came up short.\n\nBy the 1990s, fairly abstract methodological disputes over\nuniversalism versus particularism faded from academic prominence, and\nthe debate now centers on the theory and practice of universal human\nrights. This is largely due to the increased political salience of\nhuman rights since the collapse of communism in the former Soviet\nbloc. On the liberal side, the new, more political voices for liberal\nuniversalism have been represented by the likes of Francis Fukuyama,\nwho famously argued that liberal democracy\u2019s triumph over its\nrivals signifies the end of history (Fukuama 1992). This view also\nrevived (and provoked) the second wave communitarian critique of\nliberal universalism and the debate became much more concrete and\npolitical in orientation.\n\nNeedless to say, the brief moment of liberal euphoria that followed\nthe collapse of the communism in the Soviet bloc has given way to a\nsober assessment of the difficulties of implementing liberal practices\noutside the Western world. It is now widely recognized that brutal\nethnic warfare, crippling poverty, environmental degradation, and\npervasive corruption, to name some of the more obvious troubles\nafflicting the developing world, pose serious obstacles to the\nsuccessful establishment and consolidation of liberal democratic\npolitical arrangements. But these were seen as unfortunate (hopefully\ntemporary) afflictions that may delay the end of history when liberal\ndemocracy has finally triumphed over its rivals. They were not meant\nto pose a challenge to the ideal of liberal democracy. It was\nwidely assumed that liberal democracy is something that all rational\nindividuals would want if they could get it.\n\nThe deeper challenge to Western liberal democracy has emerged from the\nEast Asian\n region.[4]\n In the 1990s, the debate revolved around the notion of \u201cAsian\nvalues\u201d, a term devised by several Asian officials and their\nsupporters for the purpose of challenging Western-style civil and\npolitical freedoms. Asians, they claim, place special emphasis upon\nfamily and social harmony, with the implication that those in the\nchaotic and crumbling societies of the West should think twice about\nintervening in Asia for the sake of promoting human rights and\ndemocracy. As Singapore\u2019s Lee Kuan Yew put it, Asians have\n\u201clittle doubt that a society with communitarian values where the\ninterests of society take precedence over that of the individual suits\nthem better than the individualism of\n America\u201d.[5]\n Such claims attracted international attention primarily because East\nAsian leaders seemed to be presiding over what a U.N. human\ndevelopment report called \u2018the most sustained and widespread\ndevelopment miracle of the twentieth century, perhaps all\n history\u2019.[6]\n In 1997\u201398, however, the East Asian miracle seemed to have\ncollapsed. And it looks like Asian values was one casualty of the\ncrisis.\n\nThe political factors that focused attention on the East Asian\nchallenge remain in place, however. East Asian economies did\neventually recover. China in particular looks set to become an\neconomic and political heavyweight with the power to seriously\nchallenge the hegemony of Western liberal democratic values in\ninternational fora (see Bell 2015). Thus, one hears frequent calls for\ncross-cultural dialogue between the West and the East designed to\nunderstand and perhaps learn from the other side. Failing to take\nseriously East Asian political perspectives risks widening\nmisunderstandings and setting the stage for hostilities that could\nhave been avoided.\n\nFrom a theoretical point of view, however, it must be conceded that\nthe official debate on Asian values has not provided much of a\nchallenge to dominant Western political outlooks. The main problem is\nthat the debate has been led by Asian leaders who seem to be motivated\nprimarily by political considerations, rather than by a sincere desire\nto make a constructive contribution to the debate on universalism\nversus particularism. Thus, it was easy to dismiss\u2014rightly so,\nin most cases\u2014the Asian challenge as nothing but a self-serving\nploy by government leaders to justify their authoritarian rule in the\nface of increasing demands for democracy at home and abroad.\n\nStill, it would be a mistake to assume that nothing of theoretical\nsignificance has emerged from East Asia. The debate on Asian values\nhas also prompted critical intellectuals in the region to reflect on\nhow they can locate themselves in a debate on human rights and\ndemocracy in which they had not previously played a substantial part.\nNeither wholly rejecting nor wholly endorsing the values and practices\nordinarily realized through a liberal democratic political regime,\nthese intellectuals are drawing on their own cultural traditions and\nexploring areas of commonality and difference with the West. Though\noften less provocative than the views of their governments in the\nsense that few argue for the wholesale rejection of Western-style\nliberal democracy with an East Asian alternative these unofficial East\nAsian viewpoints may offer more lasting contributions to the debate.\nLet me (briefly) note three relatively persuasive East Asian arguments\nfor cultural particularism that contrast with traditional Western\narguments for liberal universalism (see Bell 2006, ch. 3):\n\n\n\nCultural factors can affect the prioritizing of rights, and\nthis matters when rights conflict and it must be decided which one to\nsacrifice. In other words, different societies may rank rights\ndifferently, and even if they face a similar set of disagreeable\ncircumstances they may come to different conclusions about the right\nthat needs to be curtailed. For example, U.S. citizens may be more\nwilling to sacrifice a social or economic right in cases of conflict\nwith a civil or political right: if neither the constitution nor a\nmajority of democratically elected representatives support universal\naccess to health care, then the right to health care regardless of\nincome can be curtailed. In contrast, the Chinese may be more willing\nto sacrifice a civil or political liberty in cases of conflict with a\nsocial or economic right: there may be wide support for restrictions\non the right to form independent labor associations if they are\nnecessary to provide the conditions for economic development.\nDifferent priorities assigned to rights can also matter when it must\nbe decided how to spend scarce resources. For example, East Asian\nsocieties with a Confucian heritage will place great emphasis upon the\nvalue of education, and they may help to explain the large amount of\nspending on education compared to other societies with similar levels\nof economic development.\n\n\nCultural factors can affect the justification of rights. In\nline with the arguments of \u201c1980s communitarians\u201d such as\nMichael Walzer, it is argued that justifications for particular\npractices valued by Western-style liberal democrats should not be made\nby relying on the abstract and unhistorical universalism that often\ndisables Western liberal democrats. Rather, they should be made from\nthe inside, from specific examples and argumentative strategies that\nEast Asians themselves use in everyday moral and political debate. For\nexample, the moral language (shared even by some local critics of\nauthoritarianism) tends to appeal to the value of community in East\nAsia, and this is relevant for social critics concerned with practical\neffect. One such communitarian argument is that democratic rights in\nSingapore can be justified on the grounds that they contribute to\nstrengthening ties to such communities as the family and the nation\n(see below, section III).\n\n\nCultural factors can provide moral foundations for\ndistinctive political practices and institutions (or at least\ndifferent from those found in Western-style liberal democracies). In\nEast Asian societies influenced by Confucianism, for example, it is\nwidely held that children have a profound duty to care for elderly\nparents, a duty to be forsaken only in the most exceptional\n circumstances.[7]\n In political practice, it means that East Asian governments have an\nobligation to provide the social and economic conditions that\nfacilitate the realization of this duty. Political debate tends to\ncenter on the question of whether the right to filial piety is best\nrealized by means of a law that makes it mandatory for children to\nprovide financial support for elderly parents as in mainland China,\nJapan, and Singapore or whether the state should rely more on indirect\nmethods such as tax breaks and housing benefits that simply make\nat-home care for the elderly easier, as in Korea and Hong Kong. But\nthe argument that there is a pressing need to secure this duty in East\nAsia is not a matter of political controversy.\n\nThinkers influenced by East Asian cultural traditions such\nConfucianism have also argued for distinctive as-yet-unrealized\npolitical practices and institutions that draw on widely-held cultural\nvalues for inspiration. For example, the Chinese thinker Jiang Qing\nhas argued for a tricameral legislature appropriate for the Chinese\ncontext, with a meritocratic \u201cHouse of Exemplary Persons\u201d\nand a \u201cHouse of Cultural Continuity\u201d that would complement\nand balance a democratic legislature (Jiang 2012). Korean scholars\nHahm Chaihark and Jongryn Mo argue for the need to revive and adapt\nfor the contemporary era such Choson dynasty institutions as policy\nlectures and the Confucian censorate, traditional institutions that\nplayed the role of monitoring the dealings of the Emperor (Hahm\n(Chaihark) 2003, Mo 2003, Bell 2000, ch. 5). \n\n\nIn contrast to 1980s communitarian thinkers, East Asian critics of\nliberal universalism have succeeded in pointing to particular\nnon-liberal practices and institutions that may be appropriate for the\ncontemporary world. Some of these may be appropriate only for\nsocieties with a Confucian heritage, others may also offer insights\nfor mitigating the excesses of liberal modernity in the West. What\ncannot be denied is that they have carried forward the debate beyond\nthe implausible alternatives to liberalism offered by 1980s\ncommunitarian thinkers.\n\nIt is worth emphasizing, however, that contemporary communitarians\nhave not been merely defending parochial attachments to particular\nnon-liberal moralities. Far from arguing that the universalist\ndiscourse on human rights should be entirely displaced with\nparticular, tradition-sensitive political language, they have\ncriticized liberals for not taking universality seriously enough, for\nfailing to do what must be done to make human rights a truly universal\nideal. These communitarians\u2014let us label them the\n\u201ccosmopolitan critics of liberal universalism\u201d\u2014have\nsuggested various means of improving the philosophical coherence and\npolitical appeal of human rights.\n\nIn fact, there is little debate over the desirability of a core set of\nhuman rights, such as prohibitions against slavery, genocide, murder,\ntorture, prolonged arbitrary detention, and systematic racial\ndiscrimination. These rights have become part of international\ncustomary law, and they are not contested in the public rhetoric of\nthe international arena. Of course many gross violations occur off the\nrecord, and human rights groups such as Amnesty International have the\ntask of exposing the gap between public allegiance to rights and the\nsad reality of ongoing abuse. This is largely practical work, however.\nThere is not much point writing about or deliberating about the\ndesirability of practices that everyone condemns at the level of\nprinciple.\n\nBut political thinkers and activists around the world can and do take\ndifferent sides on many pressing human rights concerns that fall\noutside what Walzer terms the \u201cminimal and universal moral\ncode\u201d (Walzer 1987, 24; Walzer 1994). This gray area of debate\nincludes criminal law, family law, women\u2019s rights, social and\neconomic rights, the rights of indigenous peoples, and the attempt to\nuniversalize Western-style democratic practices. The question is: how\ncan the current thin list of universal human rights be expanded to\ninclude some of these contested rights?\n\nCharles Taylor has put forward the following proposal (Taylor 1999).\nHe imagines a cross-cultural dialogue between representatives of\ndifferent traditions. Rather than argue for the universal validity of\ntheir views, however, he suggests that participants should allow for\nthe possibility that their own beliefs may be mistaken. This way,\nparticipants can learn from each others\u2019 \u201cmoral\nuniverse\u201d. There will come a point, however, when differences\ncannot be reconciled. Taylor explicitly recognizes that different\ngroups, countries, religious communities, and civilizations hold\nincompatible fundamental views on theology, metaphysics, and human\nnature. In response, Taylor argues that a \u201cgenuine, unforced\nconsensus\u201d on human rights norms is possible only if we allow\nfor disagreement on the ultimate justifications of those norms.\nInstead of defending contested foundational values when we encounter\npoints of resistance (and thus condemning the values we do not like in\nother societies), we should try to abstract from those beliefs for the\npurpose of working out an \u201coverlapping consensus\u201d (to\nborrow from Rawls\u2019s 1993 terminology) of human rights norms. As\nTaylor puts it, \u201cwe would agree on the norms while disagreeing\non why they were the right norms, and we would be content to live in\nthis consensus, undisturbed by the differences of profound underlying\nbelief\u201d (Taylor 1999, 124).\n\nWhile Taylor\u2019s proposal moves the debate on universal human\nrights forward, it still faces certain difficulties. For one thing, it\nmay not be realistic to expect that people will be willing to abstract\nfrom the values they care deeply about during the course of a global\ndialogue on human rights. Even if people agree to abstract from\nculturally specific ways of justifying and implementing norms, the\nlikely outcome is a withdrawal to a highly general, abstract realm of\nagreement that fails to resolve actual disputes over contested rights.\nFor example, participants in a cross-cultural dialogue can agree on\nthe right not to be subject to cruel and unusual punishment while\nradically disagreeing upon what this means in practice\u2014a\ncommitted Muslim can argue that theft can justifiably be punished by\namputation of the right\n hand,[8]\n whereas a Western liberal will want to label this an example of cruel\nand unusual punishment.\n\nAs we have seen, the debate on universalism versus particularism has\nmoved from fairly abstract methodological disputes between\nAnglo-American philosophers to relatively concrete international\npolitical disputes between philosophers, social scientists, government\nofficials, and NGO activists. The distinctive communitarian\ncontribution has been to cast doubt on universal theories grounded\nexclusively in the liberal moralities of the Western world, on the\ngrounds that cultural particularity should both make one sensitive to\nthe possibility of justifiable areas of difference between the West\nand the rest and to the need for more cross-cultural dialogue for the\npurpose of improving the current thin human rights regime. Various\ncontributions from East Asia and elsewhere have given some meat to\nthese challenges to liberal universalism. In any case, let us now turn\nto the second main area of controversy between liberals and\ncommunitarians\u2014the debate over the self that has similarly moved\nfrom philosophy to politics.\n2. The Debate Over the Self\n\nCommunitarian thinkers in the 1980s such as Michael Sandel and Charles\nTaylor argued that Rawlsian liberalism rests on an overly\nindividualistic conception of the self. Whereas Rawls argues that we\nhave a supreme interest in shaping, pursuing, and revising our own\nlife-plans, he neglects the fact that our selves tend to be defined or\nconstituted by various communal attachments (e.g., ties to the family\nor to a religious tradition) so close to us that they can only be set\naside at great cost, if at all. This insight led to the view that\npolitics should not be concerned solely with securing the conditions\nfor individuals to exercise their powers of autonomous choice, as we\nalso need to sustain and promote the social attachments crucial to our\nsense of well-being and respect, many of which have been involuntarily\npicked up during the course of our upbringing. First, however, let us\nreview the ontological or metaphysical debate over the self that led\nto this political conclusion. \n\nIn an influential essay titled \u201cAtomism\u201d, Charles Taylor\nobjected to the liberal view that \u201cmen are self-sufficient\noutside of society\u201d. (Taylor 1985, 2000) Instead, Taylor defends\nthe Aristotelian view that \u201cMan is a social animal, indeed a\npolitical animal, because he is not self-sufficient alone, and in an\nimportant sense is not self-sufficient outside a polis\u201d (Taylor\n1985, 190). Moreover, this atomistic view of the self can undermine\nliberal society, because it fails to grasp the extent to which\nliberalism presumes a context where individuals are members of, and\ncommitted to, a society that promotes particular values such as\nfreedom and individual diversity. Fortunately, most people in liberal\nsocieties do not really view themselves as atomistic selves.\n\nBut do liberal thinkers actually defend the idea that the self is\ncreated ex-nihilo, outside of any social context and that\nhumans can exist (and flourish) independently of all social contexts?\nIn fact, Taylor\u2019s essay was directed at the libertarian thinker\nRobert Nozick. As it turns out, the communitarian critique of the\natomistic self does not apply to Rawslian liberalism: in Part III of\nTheory of Justice, Rawls pays close attention to the\npsychological and social conditions that facilitate the formation of\nliberal selves committed to justice. But few readers ever got to Part\nIII of Rawls\u2019 massive tome, so communitarians got quite a bit of\nmileage from their critique of liberal atomism. This charge\ndidn\u2019t stick, however.\n\nWhile liberals may not have been arguing that individuals can\ncompletely extricate themselves from their social context,\nthe liberal valuation of choice still seemed to suggest an image of a\nsubject who impinges his will on the\n world.[9]\n Drawing on the insights of Heidegger and Wittgenstein, communitarians\nargued that this view neglects the extent to which individuals are\nembodied agents in the world. Far from acting in ways designed to\nrealize an autonomously arrived-at life-plan, vast areas of our lives\nare in fact governed by unchosen routines and habits that lie in the\nbackground. More often than not we act in ways specified by our social\nbackground when we walk, dress, play games, speak, and so on without\nhaving formulated any goals or made any choices. It is only when\nthings break down from the normal, everyday, unchosen mode of\nexistence that we think of ourselves as subjects dealing with an\nexternal world, having the experience of formulating various ways of\nexecuting our goals, choosing from among those ways, and accepting\nresponsibility for the outcomes of our actions. In other words,\ntraditional intentionality is introduced at the point that our\nordinary way of coping with things is insufficient. Yet this breakdown\nmode is what we tend to notice, and philosophers have therefore argued\nthat most of our actions are occasioned by processes of reflection.\nLiberals have picked up this mistaken assumption, positing the idea of\na subject who seeks to realize an autonomously arrived-at life-plan,\nlosing sight of the fact that critical reflection upon one\u2019s\nends is nothing more than one possibility that arises when our\nordinary ways of coping with things is insufficient to get things\ndone.\n\nSome liberals have replied by recognizing the point that vast areas of\nour lives are governed by unchosen habits and routines, that the\ndeliberate, effortful, choosing subject mode may be the exception\nrather than the rule. They emphasize, however, that the main\njustification for a liberal politics concerned primarily with securing\nthe conditions for individuals to lead autonomous lives rests on the\npossibility and desirability of normative self-determination,\nthat is, on the importance of making choices with respect to things\nthat we value (Doppelt 1989). While it may be true that\ncertain communal practices often, or even mostly, guide our behavior\nbehind our backs, it doesn\u2019t follow that those practices ought\nto be valued, or reflectively endorsed in non-ordinary moments of\nexistence, much less that the government ought somehow to promote\nthese practices. And what liberals care about ultimately is the\nprovision of the rights, powers, and opportunities that individuals\nneed to develop and implement their own conceptions of the good\nlife.\n\nThis qualified version of the liberal self, however, still seems to\nimply that moral outlooks are, or should be, the product of individual\nchoice. One\u2019s social world, communitarians can reply, provides\nmore than non-moral social practices like table manners and\npronunciation norms\u2014it also provides some sort of orientation in\nmoral space. We cannot make sense of our moral experience\nunless we situate ourselves within this given moral space, within the\nauthoritative moral horizons. What Charles Taylor calls \u201chigher,\nstrongly evaluated goods\u201d (Taylor 1989)\u2014the goods we\nshould feel committed to, those that generate moral obligations on us\nregardless of our actual preferences are not somehow invented by\nindividuals, but rather they are located within the social world which\nprovides one\u2019s framework of the lower and the higher. Thus, the\nliberal ideal of a self who freely invents her own moral outlook, or\nprivate conception of the good, cannot do justice to our actual moral\nexperience.\n\nBut once again, liberals need not deny the assumption that our social\nworld provides a framework of the higher and the lower nor need it be\npresumed that we must regard our own moral outlook as freely invented.\nWill Kymlicka, for example, explicitly recognizes that things have\nworth for us in so far as they are granted significance by our\nculture, in so far as they fit into a pattern of activities which is\nrecognized by those sharing a certain form of life as a way of leading\na good life (Kymlicka 1989, 166). That one\u2019s social world\nprovides the range of things worth doing, achieving, or being does\nnot, however, undermine the liberal emphasis on autonomy, for there is\nstill substantial room for individual choice to be made within this\nset. The best life is still the one where the individual\nchooses what is worth doing, achieving, or being, though it\nmay be that this choice has to be made within a certain framework\nwhich is itself unchosen.\n\nCommunitarians can reply by casting doubt on the view that choice is\nintrinsically valuable, that a certain moral principle or\ncommunal attachment is more valuable simply because it has been chosen\nfollowing deliberation among alternatives by an individual subject. If\nwe have a highest-order interest in choosing our central projects and\nlife-plans, regardless of what is chosen, it ought to follow that\nthere is something fundamentally wrong with unchosen attachments and\nprojects. But this view violates our actual self-understandings. We\nordinarily think of ourselves, Michael Sandel says, \u201cas members\nof this family or community or nation or people, as bearers of this\nhistory, as sons or daughters of that revolution, as citizens of this\nrepublic\u201d, (Sandel 1981, 179) social attachments that more often\nthan not are involuntarily picked up during the course of our\nupbringing, rational choice having played no role whatsoever. I\ndidn\u2019t choose to love my mother and father, to care about the\nneighborhood in which I grew up, to have special feelings for the\npeople of my country, and it is difficult to understand why anyone\nwould think I have chosen these attachments, or that I ought to have\ndone so. In fact, there may even be something distasteful about\nsomeone who questions the things he or she deeply cares\nabout\u2014certainly no marriage could survive too long if\nfundamental understandings regarding love and trust were constantly\nthrown open for discussion! Nor is it obvious that, say, someone who\nperforms a good deed following prolonged calculation of pros and cons\nis morally superior than a Mother-Teresa type who unreflectively,\nspontaneously acts on behalf of other people\u2019s interests.\n\nLiberals can reply that the real issue is not the desirability of\nchoice, but rather the possibility of choice. There may well\nbe some unchosen attachments that need not be critically reflected\nupon and endorsed, and it may even be the case that excessive\ndeliberation about the things we care about can occasionally be\ncounter-productive. But some of our ends may be problematic and that\nis why we have a fundamental interest in being able to question and\nrevise them. Most important is not choosing our own life-plans;\nrather, liberalism founded on the value of self-determination requires\nonly that we be able to critically evaluate our ends if need\nbe, hence that \u201cno end or goal is exempt from possible\nre-examination\u201d (Kymlicka 1989, 52; Dworkin 1989, 489; Macedo\n1990, 247). For example, an oppressed woman has a fundamental interest\nin being able to critically reflect upon traditional understandings of\nwhat it means to be a good wife and mother, and it would be unjust to\nforeclose her freedom to radically revise her plans.\n\nThis response, however, still leaves open the possibility of a deep\nchallenge to liberal foundations. Perhaps we are able to reexamine\nsome attachments, but the problem for liberalism arises if there are\nothers so fundamental to our identity that they cannot be set aside,\nand that any attempt to do so will result in serious and perhaps\nirreparable psychological damage. In fact, this challenge to\nliberalism would only require that communitarians be able to identify\none end or communal attachment so constitutive of one\u2019s identity\nthat it cannot be revised and rejected. A psychoanalyst, for example,\nmay want to argue that (at least in some cases) it is impossible to\nchoose to shed the attachment one feels for one\u2019s mother, and\nthat an attempt may lead to perverse and unintended consequences. A\nfeminist theorist may point to the mother-child relationship as an\nexample of a constitutive feature of one\u2019s identity and argue\nthat any attempt to deny this fails to be sensitive to women\u2019s\nspecial needs and experiences (Frazer & Lacey 1993, 53\u201360).\nAn anthropologist may argue on the basis of field observations that it\nis impossible for an Inuit person from Canada\u2019s far north to\nsuddenly decide to stop being an Inuit and that the only sensible\nresponse is to recognize and accept this constitutive feature of his\nidentity. Or a gay liberation activist may claim that it is both\nimpossible and undesirable for gays to repress their\nbiologically-given sexual identity. These arguments are not\nimplausible, and they seem to challenge the liberal view that no\nparticular end or commitment should be beyond critical reflection and\nopen to revision.\n\nLet us assume, for the sake of argument, that we can identify one\nparticular attachment so deeply-embedded that it is impossible to\nreally bring to conscious awareness and so significant for one\u2019s\nwell-being that an individual can only forsake commitment to its good\nat the cost of being seriously psychologically disturbed. This end is\nbeyond willed change and one loses a commitment to it at the price of\nbeing thrown into a state of disorientation where one is unable to\ntake a stand on many things of significance (Taylor 1989, 26\u20137).\nDoes this really threaten liberal politics? It may, if liberal\npolitics really rests on the liberal self. Fortunately, that is not\nthe case. Rereading some of the communitarian texts from the 1980s,\nthere seems to have been an assumption that once you expose faulty\nfoundations regarding the liberal self, the whole liberal edifice will\ncome tumbling down. The task is to criticize the underlying philosophy\nof the self, win people on your side, and then we can move on to a\nbrand new communitarian society that owes nothing to the liberal\ntradition. This must have been an exhilarating time for would-be\nrevolutionaries, but more level-headed communitarians soon realized\nthat overthrowing liberal rights was never part of the agenda. Even if\nliberals are wrong to deny the existence of constitutive\nends\u2014even if the philosophical justifications for a liberal form\nof social organization founded on the value of reflective choice are\nrotten to the core\u2014there are still many, relatively pragmatic\nreasons for caring about rights in the modern world. To name some of\nthe more obvious benefits, liberal rights often contribute to\nsecurity, political stability and economic modernization.\n\nIn short, the whole debate about the self appears to have been\nsomewhat misconceived. Liberals were wrong to think they needed to\nprovide iron-clad philosophies of the self to justify liberal\npolitics, and communitarians were wrong to think that challenging\nthose foundations was sufficient to undermine liberal politics. Not\nsurprisingly, both sides soon got tired of debating the pros and cons\nof the liberal self. By the early 1990s, this liberal-communitarian\ndebate over the self had effectively faded from view in Anglo-American\n philosophy.[10]\n\nSo what remains of the communitarian conception of the self? What may\nbe distinctive about communitarians is that they are more inclined to\nargue that individuals have a vital interest in leading decent\ncommunal lives, with the political implication that there may be a\nneed to sustain and promote the communal attachments crucial to our\nsense of well-being. This is not necessarily meant to challenge the\nliberal view that some of our communal attachments can be problematic\nand may need to be changed, thus that the state needs to protect our\npowers to shape, pursue, and revise our own life-plans. But our\ninterest in community may occasionally conflict with our other vital\ninterest in leading freely chosen lives, and the communitarian view is\nthat the latter does not automatically trump the former in cases of\nconflict. On the continuum between freedom and community,\ncommunitarians are more inclined to draw the line towards the\nlatter.\n\nBut these conflicts cannot be resolved in the abstract. Much turns on\nempirical analyses of actual politics\u2014to what extent our\ninterest in community is indeed threatened by excess liberal politics,\nto what extent the state can play a role in remedying the situation,\nto what extent the nourishment of communal ties should be left to\ncivil society, and so on. This is where the political communitarians\nof the last decade have shed some light. Let us now turn to the\npolitics of community, the third major strand of the communitarian\nthought.\n3. The Politics of Community\n\nIn retrospect, it seems obvious that communitarian critics of\nliberalism may have been motivated not so much by philosophical\nconcerns as by certain pressing political concerns, namely, the\nnegative social and psychological effects related to the atomistic\ntendencies of modern liberal societies. Whatever the soundness of\nliberal principles, in other words, the fact remains that many\ncommunitarians seem worried by a perception that traditional liberal\ninstitutions and practices have contributed to, or at least do not\nseem up to the task of dealing with, such modern phenomena as\nalienation from the political process, unbridled greed, loneliness,\nurban crime, and high divorce rates. And given the seriousness of\nthese problems in the United States, it was perhaps inevitable that a\nsecond wave of 1990s communitarians such as Amitai Etzioni and William\nGalston would turn to the more practical political terrain of\nemphasizing social responsibility and promoting policies meant to stem\nthe erosion of communal life in an increasingly fragmented\n society.[11]\n Much of this thinking has been carried out in the flagship\ncommunitarian periodical, The Responsive Community, which is\nedited by Amitai Etzioni and includes contributions by an eclectic\ngroup of philosophers, social scientists, and public policy makers\n[this periodical, regrettably, folded in 2004 due to financial\nconstraints]. Etzioni is also the director of a think-tank,\nInstitute for Communitarian Policy Studies, that produces\nworking papers and advises government officials in\n Washington.[12]\n\nSuch political communitarians blame both the left and the right for\nour current malaise. The political left is chastised not just for\nsupporting welfare rights economically unsustainable in an era of slow\ngrowth and aging populations, but also for shifting power away from\nlocal communities and democratic institutions and towards centralized\nbureaucratic structures better equipped to administer the fair and\nequal distribution of benefits, thus leading to a growing sense of\npowerlessness and alienation from the political process. Moreover, the\nmodern welfare state with its universalizing logic of rights and\nentitlements has undermined family and social ties in civil society by\nrendering superfluous obligations to communities, by actively\ndiscouraging private efforts to help others (e.g., union rules and\nstrict regulations in Sweden prevent parents from participating\nvoluntarily in the governance of some day care centers to which they\nsend their children), and even by providing incentives that discourage\nthe formation of families (e.g., welfare payments are cut off in many\nAmerican states if a recipient marries a working person) and encourage\nthe break-up of families (e.g., no-fault divorce in the US is often\nfinancially rewarding for the non custodial parent, usually the\nfather).\n\nLibertarian solutions favored by the political right have contributed\neven more directly to the erosion of social responsibilities and\nvalued forms of communal life, particularly in the UK and the US. Far\nfrom producing beneficial communal consequences, the invisible hand of\nunregulated free-market capitalism undermines the family (e.g., few\ncorporations provide enough leave to parents of newborn children),\ndisrupts local communities (e.g., following plant closings or the\nshifting of corporate headquarters), and corrupts the political\nprocess (e.g., US politicians are often dependent on economic interest\ngroups for their political survival, with the consequence that they no\nlonger represent the community at large). Moreover, the valorization\nof greed in the Thatcher/Reagan era justified the extension of\ninstrumental considerations governing relationships in the marketplace\ninto spheres previously informed by a sense of uncalculated\nreciprocity and civil obligation. This trend has been reinforced by\nincreasing globalization, which pressures states into conforming to\nthe dictates of the international marketplace.\n\nMore specifically in the American context, communitarian thinkers such\nas Mary Ann Glendon indict a new version of rights discourse that has\nachieved dominance of late (Glendon 1991). Whereas the assertion of\nrights was once confined to matters of essential human interest, a\nstrident rights rhetoric has colonized contemporary political\ndiscourse, thus leaving little room for reasoned discussion and\ncompromise, justifying the neglect of social responsibilities without\nwhich a society could not function, and ultimately weakening all\nappeals to rights by devaluing the really important ones.\n\nTo remedy this imbalance between rights and responsibilities in the\nUS, political communitarians proposed a moratorium on the manufacture\nof new rights and changes to our \u201chabits of the heart\u201d\naway from exclusive focus on personal fulfillment and towards concern\nwith bolstering families, schools, neighborhoods, and national\npolitical life, changes to be supported by certain public policies.\nNotice that this proposal takes for granted basic civil and political\nliberties already in place, thus alleviating the concern that\ncommunitarians are embarking on a slippery slope to authoritarianism.\nStill, commmunitarian thinkers quietly lifted the call for a\nmoratorium on the minting of new rights, presumably because of growing\nconsensus that marginalized groups, such as same-sex couples seeking\nthe right to legally sanctioned marriage, have a legitimate claim to\nnew rights (Macedo, 2015) and would be paying the price for the\nexcesses of others if the moratorium is put into effect.\n\nMore serious from the standpoint of those generally sympathetic to\ncommunitarian aspirations, however, is the question of what exactly\nthis has to do with community. For one thing, Etzioni himself seeks to\njustify his policies with reference to need to maintain a balance\nbetween social order and freedom, (Etzioni 1996) as opposed\nto appealing to the importance of community. But there is nothing\ndistinctively communitarian about the preoccupation with social order;\nboth liberals such as John Stuart Mill and Burkean conservatives\naffirm the need for order. And when the term community is employed by\npolitical communitarians, it seems to mean anything they want it to\nmean. Worse, as Elizabeth Frazer has argued, it has often been used to\njustify hierarchical arrangements and delegitimize areas of conflict\nand contestation in modern societies (Frazer 1999).\n\nStill, it is possible to make sense of the term community as a\nnormative\n ideal.[13]\n Communitarians begin by positing a need to experience our lives as\nbound up with the good of the communities out of which our identity\nhas been constituted. This excludes contingent attachments such as\ngolf-club memberships, that do not usually bear on ones sense of\nidentity and well-being (the co-authors of Habits of the\nHeart (Bellah et al. 1985) employ the term\n\u201clifestyle enclaves\u201d to describe these attachments).\nUnlike pre-modern defenders of Gemeinshaft, however, it is\nassumed that there are many valued forms of communal life in\nthe modern world. So the distinctive communitarian political project\nis to identify valued forms of community and to devise policies\ndesigned to protect and promote them, without sacrificing too much\nfreedom. Typically, communitarians would invoke the following types of\ncommunities:\n\n\n\nCommunities of place, or communities based on geographical location.\nThis is perhaps the most common meaning associated with the word\ncommunity. In this sense, community is linked to locality, in the\nphysical, geographical sense of a community that is located somewhere.\nIt can refer to a small village or a big city. A community of place\nalso has an affective component\u2014it refers to the place one calls\n\u201chome\u201d, often the place where one is born and bred and the\nplace where one would like to end one\u2019s days even if home is\nleft as an adult. At the very least, communitarians posit an interest\nin identifying with familiar surroundings.\n\nIn terms of political implications, it means that, for example,\npolitical authorities ought to consider the existent character of the\nlocal community when considering plans for development (Jane Jacobs\nfamously documented the negative effects of razing, instead of\nrenovating, run-down tenements that are replaced by functionally\nadequate but characterless low-income housing blocs (Jacobs 1965).\nEven big cities can and should strive to protect and promote a\ndistinctive ethos (Bell and de-Shalit 2011). Other suggestions to\nprotect communities of place include: granting community councils veto\npower over building projects that fail to respect existent\narchitectural styles; implementing laws regulating plant closures so\nas to protect local communities from the effects of rapid capital\nmobility and sudden industrial change; promoting local-ownership of\ncorporations; (Shuman 1999) and imposing restrictions on large-scale\ndiscount outlets such as Wal-Mart that threaten to displace small,\nfragmented, and diverse family and locally owned stores (Ehrenhalt\n1999). \n\n\nCommunities of memory, or groups of strangers who share a\nmorally-significant history. This term\u2014first employed by the\nco-authors of Habits of the Heart\u2014refers to imagined\ncommunities that have a shared history going back several generations.\nBesides tying us to the past, such communities turn us towards the\nfuture\u2014members strive to realize the ideals and aspirations\nembedded in past experiences of those communities, seeing their\nefforts as being, in part, contributions to a common good. They\nprovide a source of meaning and hope in peoples lives. Typical\nexamples include the nation and language-based ethnocultural\ngroups.\n\nIn Western liberal democracies, this typically translates into various\nnation-building exercises meant to nourish the bonds of commonality\nthat tie people to their nations, such as national service and\nnational history lessons in school textbooks. Self-described\nrepublicans such as Michael Sandel place special emphasis upon the\nnational political community and argue for measures that increase\ncivic engagement and public-spiritedness (Sandel 1996). However, there\nis increased recognition of the multi-national nature of contemporary\nstates, and modern Western states must also try to make room for the\npolitical rights of minority groups. These political measures have\nbeen widely discussed in the recent literature on nationalism,\ncitizenship, and multiculturalism (Kymlicka 1995, Miller 1995, Macedo\n2000, Tamir 1993). \n\n\nPsychological communities, or communities of face-to-face personal\ninteraction governed by sentiments of trust, co-operation, and\naltruism. This refers to a group of persons who participate in common\nactivity and experience a psychological sense of togetherness as\nshared ends are sought. Such communities, based on face-to-face\ninteraction, are governed by sentiments of trust, cooperation, and\naltruism in the sense that constituent members have the good of the\ncommunity in mind and act on behalf of the community\u2019s interest. They\ndiffer from communities of place by not being necessarily defined by\nlocality and proximity. The differ from communities of memory in the\nsense that they are more \u201creal\u201d, they are typically based\non face to face social interaction at one point in time and\nconsequently tend to be restricted in\n size.[14]\n The family is the prototypical example. Other examples include\nsmall-scale work or school settings founded on trust and social\ncooperation. \n\nCommunitarians tend to favor policies designed to protect and promote\nties to the family and family-like groups. This would include such\nmeasures as encouraging marriage and increasing the difficulty of\nlegal marriage dissolution. These policies are supported by empirical\nevidence that points to the psychological and social benefits of\nmarriage (Waite 1996). Communitarians also favor political legislation\nthat can help to restructure education in such a way that peoples\ndeepest needs in membership and participation in psychological\ncommunities are tapped at a young age. The primary school system in\nJapan, where students learn about group cooperation and benefits and\nrewards are assigned to the classroom as a whole rather than to\nindividual students, could be a useful model (Reid 1999). \n\n\nWhat makes the political project of communitarianism distinctive is\nthat it involves the promotion of all three forms of valued communal\nlife. This leads, however, to the worry that seeking the goods of\nvarious communities may conflict in practice. Etzioni, for example,\nargues for a whole host of pro-family measures: mothers and fathers\nshould devote more time and energy to parenting (in view of the fact\nthat most childcare centers do a poor job of caring for children),\nlabor unions and employers ought to make it easier for parents to work\nat home, and the government should force corporations to provide six\nmonths of paid leave and another year of unpaid leave (Etzioni 1993,\nch.2 and Etzioni 1996, ch.6). The combined effect of these changes of\nthe heart and public policies in all likelihood would be to make\ncitizens into largely private, family-centered persons.\n\nYet Etzioni also argues that the American political system is corrupt\nto the core, concluding that only extensive involvement in public\naffairs by virtuous citizens can remedy the situation: \u201conce\ncitizens are informed, they must make it their civic duty to\norganize others locally, regionally, and nationally to act on\ntheir understanding of what it takes to clean up public life in\nAmerica\u201d (Etzioni 1993, 244) But few can afford sufficient time\nand energy to devote themselves fully to both family life and public\naffairs, and favoring one ideal is most likely to erode the other.\nSurely it is no coincidence that republican America in\nJefferson\u2019s day relied on active, public-spirited male citizens\nlargely freed from family responsibilities. Conversely, societies\ncomposed of persons leading rich and fulfilling family lives (such as\ncontemporary Singapore) tend to be ruled by paternalistic despots who\ncan rely on a compliant, politically apathetic populace.\n\nCommunitarians who advocate both increased commitment to public\naffairs and strengthened ties to the workplace (to the point that it\nbecomes a psychological community) also face the problem of\nconflicting commitments. Michael Sandel, for example, speaks favorable\nof \u201cproud craftsmen\u201d in the Jacksonian era and of Louis\nBrandeis\u2019s idea of \u201cindustrial democracy, in which workers\nparticipated in management and shared responsibilities for running the\nbusiness\u201d (Sandel 1996, 170, 213) Identification with the\nworkplace and industrial democracy are said to improve workers civic\ncapacities, but that may not be the case. In the same way that\nextensive involvement in family life can conflict with commitments to\npublic life, few persons will have sufficient time and energy for\nextensive participation in both workplace and public affairs. Recall\nthat the republican society of ancient Athens relied on active,\npublic-spirited males freed from the need to work (slaves did most of\nthe drudge labor).\n\nIt is also worth noting that devotion to the workplace can undermine\nfamily life. As Tatsuo Inoue of Tokyo University argues,\nJapanese-style communitarianism\u2014strong communal identity based\non the workplace\u2014sometimes leads to karoshi (death from\noverwork) and frequently deprives workers of \u201cthe right to sit\ndown at the dinner table with their families\u201d (Inoue 1993). Just\nas liberals (pace Ronald Dworkin) sometimes have to choose between\nideals (e.g., freedom and equality) that come into conflict with one\nanother if a serious effort is made to realize any one of them fully,\nso communitarians may have to make some hard choices between valued\nforms of communal life.\n\nStill, there may be some actual or potential win-win scenarios cases\nwhere promoting a particular form of communal life can promote, rather\nthan undermine, other forms\u2014and political communitarians will of\ncourse favor change of this sort. For example, critics have objected\nto residential community associations, or \u201cwalled\ncommunities\u201d, on the grounds that they undermine attachment to\nthe polity at large and erode the social cohesion and trust needed to\npromote social justice and sustain the democratic process (McKenzie\n 1994).[15]\n Might it then be possible to reform urban planning so that people can\nnurture strong local communities without undermining attachment to the\nnational community, perhaps even strengthening broader forms of\npublic-spiritedness? Many practical suggestions along these lines have\nbeen raised. Architects and urban planners in the US known as the New\nUrbanists, for example, have proposed various measures to strengthen\ncommunity building\u2014affordable housing, public transport,\npedestrian focused environments, and public space as an integral part\nof neighborhoods\u2014that would not have the\n\u201cprivatizing\u201d consequences of gated communities. The\nproblem, as Gerald Frug points out, is that \u201cvirtually\neverything they want to do is now illegal. To promote the new urbanist\nversion of urban design, cities would have revise municipal zoning\nlaws and development policy from top to\n bottom.\u201d[16]\n This points to the need for public policy recommendations explicitly\ndesigned to favor complementing forms of communal attachments.\n\nJust as it would be wrong to assume that communitarian goals always\nconflict, so one should allow for the possibility that individual\nrights and communitarian goals can co-exist and complement each\n other.[17]\n In Singapore, for example, it can be argued that more secure\ndemocratic rights would have the effect of strengthening commitment to\nthe common national\n good.[18]\n The Singapore government does not hide the fact that it makes life\ndifficult for many who aim to enter the political arena on the side of\nopposition parties: Between 1971 and 1993, according to Attorney\nGeneral Chan Sek Keong, eleven opposition politicians were made\nbankrupt (and hence ineligible to run in\n elections).[19]\n Whether intended or not, such actions send an unpatriotic message to\nthe community at large: Politics is a dangerous game for those who\nhaven\u2019t been specially anointed by the top leadership of the\nruling party, so you should stick to your own private affairs. As\nSingaporean journalist Cherian George puts it, one can hardly blame\npeople for ignoring their social and political obligations \u201cwhen\nthey hear so many cautionary tales: Of Singaporeans whose careers came\nto a premature end after they voiced dissent; of critics who found\nthemselves under investigation; of individuals who were detained\nwithout trial even though they seemed not to pose any real threat; of\ntapped phones and opened letters\u201d. The moral of these stories:\nIn Singapore, better to mind your own business, make money, and leave\npolitics to the\n politicians.\u2019[20]\n Put positively, if the aim is to secure attachment to the community\nat large, then implementing genuinely competitive elections, including\nthe freedom to run for the opposition without fear of\n retaliation,[21]\n is an important first step (see also Chan 2014). The communitarian\ncase for democratic elections is particularly powerful in small\ncommunities where it is easier to establish a sense of communal\nsolidarity (in larger political communities, such as China, elections\nmay contribute to disharmony; see Bell 2015, chs. 1 and 4).\n\nThe Singapore case, however, points to another dimension of the\npolitics of community that brings us back to the communitarian defense\nof cultural particularism. Democratic reformers in Singapore typically\nthink of democracy in terms of free and fair competitive elections\nwhat Western analysts often label \u201cminimal democracy\u201d. In\nHong Kong, the situation is similar\u2014the aspiration to\n\u201cfull\u201d democracy put forward by social critics turns out\nto mean (nothing more than) an elected legislature and Chief\nExecutive. Put differently, it is quite striking that the republican\ntradition in communitarian thought with its vision of strong democracy\nsupported by active, public-spirited citizens who participate in\npolitical decision-making and held shape the future direction of their\nsociety though political debate seems largely absent from political\ndiscourse in Singapore and Hong Kong, and perhaps East Asia more\ngenerally. Many East Asians are clamoring for secure democratic\nrights, but this rarely translates into the demand that all citizens\nshould be committed to politics on an ongoing basis or the view that,\nas David Miller puts it, \u201cpolitics is indeed a necessary part of\nthe good life\u201d (Miller 2000). At one level, the relative absence\nof republican ideals can be explained by the fact that there are no\nequivalents of Aristotle and Jean-Jacques Rousseau in East Asian\nphilosophy. It can also be argued that republicanism fails to resonate\nbecause East Asians typically place more emphasis on other forms of\ncommunal life\u2014the family in particular has been important theme\nin Confucian ethical theory and practice (relative to Western\nphilosophy). To the extent that different forms of communal life do\nconflict in practice, in short, it may the case that different\ncultures will draw the line in different places. \n\nBut this is not to suggest that each community draws the line in its\nown way, and there is no more room for moral debate or social\ncritique. While there may be a strong case for endorsing \u201cthe\nway things are done\u201d if shared understandings conform to the\nviews shared by both defenders and critics of the political status\nquo, more often than not social critics will find fault with the\ncommunitarian excesses in particular societies. For example, Chang\nKyung-Sup argues that Korean \u201cfamilism\u201d harms individuals\nand poses a serious stumbling block to the establishment of a\ndemocratic polity in Korea (see Chang 2004). In this context, it may\nwell be counter-productive to place too much emphasis on the moral\nqualities of family\n life[22].\n But other societies\u2014relatively individualistic societies\nsuffering from the undesirable social consequences of divorce and\nsingle-parent families or communitarian societies that justify\nsacrificing families in the interests of the workplace\u2014may need\nto rejuvenate family life and they may well look to Korean\n\u201cfamilism\u201d for ideas. In other words, what seems like a\ncommunitarian excess\u2019 in one society can be a source of\ninspiration for another. \n\nSo, the conclusion is, yes, community is valuable\u2014at least as\nvaluable as the need for freedom, if not more\n so[23].\n Communitarians have usefully distinguished between forms of valuable\ncommunities and Anglo-American political communitarians have designed\nmenus of policy options to promote those forms of communities. The\nvarieties of communitarian politics in East Asia offers further\npossibilities. However, which form of community to emphasize and which\nform to deemphasize depends upon the needs and problems of particular\nsocieties. The political implications of communitarianism, in short,\ndepend upon the cultural outlooks and social priorities of particular\n contexts[24].\n \n\nLet me end with the question of why East Asians should look to\ncommunitarianism when the rich and diverse Confucian tradition can be\ndrawn upon to express communitarian values. After all, there is\nsubstantial overlap between the two philosophies\u2014both emphasize\nthe value of relationships for the good life as well as stress the\nimportance of education and non-coercive modes of moral education with\nlegal rights as last resort fall-back mechanisms (see Bell 2008, ch.\n9)\u2014so why not stick to the \u201clocal\u201d philosophy of\nConfucianism? In an East Asian context, it seems strange to promote a\ncommunitarian philosophy that was shaped by concerns about\nindividualistic excesses in Western countries when the communitarian\nConfucian tradition continues to shape values and inform \u201chabits\nof the heart\u201d (see Sun 2013; Hammond and Richey 2015; Billioud\nand Thoravel 2015). And it\u2019s still a matter of argument whether\ncommunitarianism really constitutes a philosophy or tradition, as\nopposed to a critical extension of the liberal tradition. But nobody\ndoubts that Confucianism constitutes its own tradition. So what good\nreason can there be for East Asians to identify with communitarianism\nrather than Confucianism? \n\nOne response is that Confucianism has been tainted by its apparent\nendorsement of immoral practices, such as patriarchal values that have\ncontributed to the subordination and suffering of women. But\ncontemporary feminist theorists have reinterpreted Confucianism to\nmake it more compatible with modern-day values while maintaining\ncommitment to central Confucian values (see, e.g., Chan 2007). And\nthose central Confucian values\u2014commitment to the family, to the\nmaterial well-being of the people, to meritocracy in education and\npolitics, to ritual (li), humaneness (ren),\ndiversity in harmony (he), and this-wordly outlooks\u2014may\nin fact be more appropriate for modern-day societies than many other\nphilosophies (consider the fact that most Western philosophers prior\nto the twentieth century devalued the family). Bai Tongdong, for\nexample, argues that a modernized form of central Confucian values can\ninspire humane governance both at home and abroad (Bai 2019). \n\nIn an East Asian context, what communitarianism can do is help to\nremedy the drawbacks of Confucianism. For example, there is a tension\nbetween the universalizing impulses of early\nConfucianism\u2014Confucius and Mencius did not consider the\npossibility of morally legitimate alternatives to their\nvalues\u2014and the moral pluralism that tends to characterize the\nmodern world. Communitarians can remind Confucians that their\nphilosophy may be more appropriate in certain settings than others,\nand that they should allow for the possibility of morally legitimate\nalternatives in different contexts. It seems strange, for example, for\nConfucians to think that Christian believers should change their\nprimary religious allegiance from God to family ancestors (just as it\nseems strange for Christians to ask Confucians to do the opposite).\n\n\nCommunitarian insights about civil society as the sites for moral\neducation can help to remedy the Confucian focus on the family as the\nonly (or main) springboard for moral learning. Confucians have long\nargued that it is possible and desirable to extend family values\noutside the family, but the family-centered reality in most East Asian\nsocieties with a Confucian heritage suggests that Confucianism may not\nbe sufficient. There has been some work exploring the\n\u2019intermediary associations\u2019 in Confucianism (see, e.g., de\nBary 1998), but the communitarians debates in the West may offer more\ninsights in this respect. Also, the Confucian emphasis on meritocratic\nrule by the most talented and virtuous members of the community may\nencourage excessive political passivity on the part of ordinary\ncitizens. Again, Confucians can look to communitarianism (as well as\ncontemporary debates about deliberative democracy) for insights about\nvalues and practices that allow ordinary citizens to make meaningful\ncontributions to the political process, even in political contexts\n(such as China) without democratic elections to choose top leaders.\nDemocratic education is not, to say the least, a Confucian imperative.\nIn short, communitarian insights can usefully supplement Confucian\nvalues in an East Asian context, just as they can supplement liberal\nvalues in Western societies.  Overall, though, it must be conceded\nthat communitarianism has lost salience as a motivating political\nideal in both East Asia and the West. Do we have any reason to think\nit might be revived? In East Asia, we can expect that communitarian\nthemes will continue to take the form of Confucian values. In the\nWest, however, the excesses of populism may present an opportunity for\ncommunitarian-inspired political activists. Populism, arguably, is a\nresponse to the decline of valued forms of community. Strongmen such\nas Donald Trump rail against elites and promise to restore traditional\nsources of meaning to disempowered and atomized individuals. But the\nproblem is not elitism or hierarchy per se. Any modern society needs\nhierarchies and the task is to distinguish between bad forms of\nhierarchy that benefit the powerful and oppress the weak, and good\nforms of hierarchy that express morally defensible values (Bell and\nWang 2020). Hierarchical forms of communal life can be reinterpreted\nand modernized so they are compatible with progressive values.\nWhat\u2019s missing is a social and political movement that can\nrestore and reinterpret forms of communal life appropriate for the\nmodern world.\n", "bibliography": {"categories": [], "cat_ref_text": {"ref_list": ["An-Naim, A., 1992, \u201cToward a Cross-Cultural Approach to\nDefining International Standards of Human Rights: The Meaning of\nCruel, Inhuman, or Degrading Treatment or Punishment\u201d, in\n<em>Human Rights in Cross-Cultural Perspectives: A Quest for\nConsensus</em>, A.
