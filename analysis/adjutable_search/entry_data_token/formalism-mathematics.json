Introduction\n\nThe locus classicus of game formalism is not a defence of the\nposition by a convinced advocate, but a demolition job by a great\nphilosopher, Gottlob Frege. Not that he was attacking a straw man\nposition: the highly influential diatribe by Frege in volume II of his\nGrundgesetze Der Arithmetik (Frege, 1903) is an attack on the\nwork of two real mathematicians, H. E. Heine and Johannes Thomae.\nMoreover, philosophers of mathematics are wont to claim that the\nposition is still widely adopted by mathematicians. It must be\nemphasised, however, that \u201cformalism\u201d in this\nsense\u2014the Heine/Thomae position as interpreted by Frege, and its\ndescendants\u2014is to be distinguished from a more sophisticated\nposition (it is claimed), namely Hilbertian formalism. For more\ninformation on the latter see Detlefsen (1993) or consult the entries\non\n Hilbert\u2019s program\n and\n the Frege-Hilbert controversy.)\n Detlefsen (2005) also provides a detailed historical treatment of\nformalist themes in thinkers from the ancient Greeks up to the period\nof Frege and Hilbert and beyond which is the focus here. \n\nAlthough it is the non-Hilbertian approach we will be concerned with\nin this entry, we briefly discuss the Hilbertian approach. The\nHilbertian position differs because it depends on a distinction within\nmathematical language between a finitary sector, whose\nsentences express contentful propositions, and an ideal, or\ninfinitary sector. Where exactly Hilbert drew the\ndistinction, or where it should be drawn, is a matter of debate.\nCrucially, though, Hilbert adopted an instrumentalistic attitude\ntowards the ideal sector. The formulae of this language are, or are\ntreated as if they are, uninterpreted, having the syntactic form of\nsentences to which we can apply formal rules of transformation and\ninference but no semantics. Nonetheless they are, or can be useful, if\nthe ideal sector conservatively extends the finitary, that is if no\nproof from finitary premisses to a finitary conclusion which takes a\ndetour through the infinitary language yields a conclusion we could\nnot have reached, albeit perhaps (herein lies the utility) by a\nlonger, more unwieldy proof. The goal of the Hilbert programme was to\nprovide a finitary proof of this conservative extension result; most,\nthough not all, think this goal was proved impossible by\nG\u00f6del\u2019s second incompleteness theorem.\n\nReturning now to our non-Hilbertian focus, the earlier formalism which\nFrege attacked does not divide mathematics into the aforementioned\ndual categories of the finitary/contentful, and the\ninfinitary/essentially meaningless but, on the contrary, treats all of\nmathematics in a unitary and homogeneous fashion. From now on I will\nuse \u2018formalism\u2019, to refer to the non-Hilbertian positions\nand will start with an account of the formalist views distilled by\nFrege from Heine and Thomae and the criticisms he made of them. These\ncriticisms are widely believed now to contain conclusive refutations\nof the Heine/Thomae approach. But there are a number of post-Fregean\nviews which seem heavily influenced by, or strongly analogous to,\nformalism. I will go through these in turn:\n\nWittgenstein\u2019s views on mathematics, primarily the\nconception to be found in his Tractatus\nLogico-Philosophicus;\nformalism as found in the Logical Positivists, particularly\nCarnap;\nGoodman and Quine\u2019s nominalist formalism;\nHaskell Curry\u2019s version of formalism and \nformalist interpretations of the Curry-Howard correspondence.\n\n\nI will conclude with a look at more recent formalist philosophers and\nan overall assessment of the prospects for formalism in contemporary\nphilosophy of mathematics.\n2. Game and Term Formalism\n\nFrege does not extract a unified, consistent position from the work of\nHeine and Thomae, and much of his criticism is devoted to showing that\nthey inconsistently slip into modes of thought which are only\nappropriate for \u2018contentful\u2019 arithmetic, which Frege takes\nto be a body of truths expressed by utterances in which numerical\nexpressions designate abstract referents independent of the mind (or\nat least any particular individual\u2019s mind). Heine and Thomae\ntalk of mathematical domains and structures, of prohibitions on what\nmay be uttered (e.g. against writing \u2018\\(3\\div 0\\)\u2019 which is\ndeemed, in some special sense, meaningless), of numbers being greater\nthan or less than one another (rather than physical marks being larger or\nsmaller, darker or lighter)\u2014all things which make no sense if\narithmetic is a theory of marks and their physical properties or is\njust a body of transformations of referent-less symbols. (Heine\nhowever reserves, with Kronecker, a special place for arithmetic,\ntreating it in non-formalist fashion; this position may thus be more\ncoherent than Thomae\u2019s. See Simons, 2009 especially\n293\u20136.)\n\nNonetheless two distinct positions emerge from the material Frege\nworks over, doctrines which Resnik (1980: 54), and likewise Shapiro\n(2000: 41\u201348) describe as term formalism and game\nformalism, respectively. The term formalist views the expressions\nof mathematics, arithmetic for example, as meaningful, the singular\nterms as referring, but as referring to symbols such as\nthemselves, rather than numbers, construed as entities distinct from\nsymbols. Thus Heine writes:\n\nI define from the standpoint of the pure formalist and call\ncertain tangible signs numbers. (quoted in Frege, 1903 [1980\n\u00a787: 183]).\n\n\nThe game formalist sticks with the view that mathematical utterances\nhave no meaning; or at any rate the terms occurring therein do not\npick out objects and properties and the utterances cannot be used to\nstate facts. Rather mathematics is a calculus in which\n\u2018empty\u2019 symbol strings are transformed according to fixed\nrules. Thomae puts it this way:\n\nFor the formalist, arithmetic is a game with signs which are called\nempty. That means that they have no other content (in the calculating\ngame) than they are assigned by their behaviour with respect to\ncertain rules of combination (rules of the game) (Frege, 1903/80\n\u00a795: 190).\n\n\nThomae also remarks \u2018the formal standpoint rids us of all\nmetaphysical difficulties\u2019 (ibid: 184). One main\nmotivation then seems to be to block, avoid, or sidestep (in some way)\nany ontological commitment to a problematic realm of abstract objects.\nFor standard mathematics entails a plethora of theorems affirming the\nexistence of infinite realms of entities\u2014numbers, functions,\nsets and so forth, entities which do not seem to be concrete.\nFormalists, in general, wish to divest themselves of any commitment to\nthese domains which do, indeed, seem hard to fit into a thoroughly\nnaturalistic conception of reality.\n\nFrege concentrates most of his fire on the term formalist\npronouncements of his targets; but game formalism is the only game in\ntown for the anti-platonist worried about the ontological commitment\nto a realm of abstract objects. For term formalism treats mathematics\nas having a content, as being a kind of syntactic theory; and standard\nsyntactic theory entails the existence of an infinity of\nentities\u2014expression types\u2014which seem every bit as abstract\nas numbers. Indeed, as G\u00f6del\u2019s arithmetisation of syntax\nshowed, the elements and inter-relationships of standard formal syntax\ncan be modelled as an infinite substructure inside the standard model of\narithmetic.\n\nFrege mercilessly exposes the inadequacies of Heine and Thomae\u2019s\nposition\u2010their confusions as they slip from term to game\nformalism; their conflation of sign and signified; the fact that they\ndo not set out an account of the syntax and proof theory which is\nremotely adequate as an account of the mathematics with which they\ndeal; their hopeless attempts to extend their position from arithmetic\nto treat of analysis and real numbers, by this stage in mathematical\nhistory construed by Weierstrass, Cantor and others not geometrically\nbut as infinite sequences. Thus Frege writes:\n\nIn order to produce it [an infinite series] we would need an\ninfinitely long blackboard, an infinite supply of chalk, and an\ninfinite length of time. We may be censured as too cruel for trying to\ncrush so high a flight of the spirit by such a homely objection; but\nthis is no answer. (219)\n\n\nNow Frege, himself, ironically, had revolutionised mathematics by\nintroducing hitherto unprecedented standards of rigour in the\nformalisation of mathematical theories. He recognised (\u00a790:\n185\u20136) that one could improve vastly on Heine and Thomae by\ntreating mathematical theories, their language, axioms and rules, as\nformal, mathematical objects in their own right. This is exactly what\nthe Hilbert programme set out successfully to achieve, creating the\nnew disciple of metamathematics.\n\nHowever Frege lays down very stiff challenges even for a rigorous game\nformalist fully equipped with the techniques and results of\nmetamathematics. Such a theorist gives us a characterisation of a\nlanguage, for example by setting out what the basic elements\nare\u2014primitive symbols, and strings thereof\u2014and then gives\na recursive specification of which strings count as well-formed.\nSimilarly we will be given a rigorous specification of which\narrangements of well-formed formulae count as proofs in a given\nsystem, and of what theorem they prove in each case. If strings such\nas \u2018\\(3+1=0\\)\u2019 or \u2018\\(3 \\gt 2\\)\u2019 come out as provable\nin the system (arithmetic modulo 4, say) then that is enough to count\nthem as correct utterances of the system. No further issue of truth\nneed arise; nor do we need to assume that there is only one system for\na given set of symbols. Nor, furthermore, need we assume that each\nsuch system is complete (though Frege took Thomae to task for the\nincompleteness, massive though readily rectifiable, of his arithmetic\ncalculus). We need make no assumption that the numerals in these\nstrings refer to anything outside the system, indeed we need not\nassume they refer to anything at all. (This game formalist, then, is\nnot subject to the objection that \u20183 \\(\\gt \n2\\)\u2019 should come out as false, on any legitimate formalist reading\nof \u2018\\(\\gt\\)\u2019; no need to think of the numerals as referring\nto concrete marks and \u2018\\(\\gt\\)\u2019 meaning physically greater in\nsize.)\n\nSuch a game formalist is a more worthy opponent for the platonistic\nFrege to tackle, but there are two main objections he sets out which\nstill apply to this more sophisticated position. The first is the\nquestion of applicability: if mathematics is just a calculus\nin which we shuffle uninterpreted symbols (or symbols whose\ninterpretation is a matter of no importance), then why has it been\napplied so successfully\u2014and in so many ways, to so many\ndifferent things\u2014ordinary physical objects, sub-atomic objects,\nfields, properties, and indeed from one part of mathematics to another\n(we can count the number of dimensions in a pure geometric space)?\nFrege writes:\n\nIt is applicability alone which elevates arithmetic from a game to the\nrank of a science. (\u00a791 in Frege 1903 [1980: 187])\n\n\nSecondly, Frege quite rightly and insistently distinguishes on the one\nhand the \u2018game\u2019\u2014arithmetic, set theory, topology or\nwhatever\u2014treated simply as a mathematical object in its own\nright, a formal system, and, on the another, the theory of the game.\n\u2018Let us remember that the theory of the game must be\ndistinguished from the game itself\u2019 (\u00a7107, p. 203). Thus in\nthe \u2018game\u2019 of trigonometry we might derive\n\n\\[\n\\sin^2\\theta +\\cos^2\\theta = 1\n\\]\n\n\nfrom the Pythagorean Theorem. In the metatheory we can prove:\n\n\\[\n\\vdash \\langle \\sin^2\\theta + \\cos^2\\theta = 1\\rangle,\n\\]\n\n\nthe claim that the formula with such and such a code in the\nmathematical representation of the syntax (the code represented in the\nmeta-meta-theory here by \u2018\\(\\langle\\sin^2\\theta +\\cos^2\\theta =\n1\\rangle\\)\u2019) is provable. Likewise in the meta-theory we can\nprove lots of other things about proof and refutation, for instance we\nmay be able to show that lots of sentences are neither provable nor\nrefutable.\n\nThe problem this raises for the formalist is this: the metatheory is\nitself a substantial piece of mathematics, ostensibly committed to an\ninfinite realm of objects which are not, on the face of it, concrete.\nTokens of the expressions of the object language game calculus may be\nfinite\u2014ink marks and the like; but since there are infinitely\nmany expressions, theorems and proofs, these themselves must be taken\nto be abstract types. At best, the formalist can achieve no more than\na reduction in commitment from the transfinite realms of some\nmathematical theories, such as set theory, to the countably infinite,\nbut still presumably abstract, realm of arithmetic, wherein the syntax\nand proof theory of standard countable languages such as those of\nstandard set theory, can, as G\u00f6del showed, be modelled.\n\nCan formalism be developed in such a way as to surmount these two\ncrucial objections, the problem of applicability and the problem of\nthe metatheory, as I will call it? (Not that these are the only\nobjections to formalism, but they are two fundamental ones.) Because\nFrege\u2019s critique did not quash all formalistic impulses in later\nphilosophers of mathematics, we shall look, now, at future\ndevelopments, to see how they fare.\n3. Tractarian Formalism\n\nWittgenstein was a keen student of Frege\u2019s work, directed to\nfurther his studies under Bertrand Russell by Frege himself in the\ncourse of a visit he made to see Frege in Jena. One might, then, think\nhim inoculated against formalism. But definite formalistic elements\nsurface in Wittgenstein\u2019s Tractatus.\n\nTrue, the Tractatus is a notoriously difficult work to\ninterpret. Even the question as to whether the main portion of the\nbook, essentially all of it other than the \u2018frame\u2019 of the\npreface and the end, is to be taken as a serious attempt to present a\nmetaphysics is controversial. If we leave that hermeneutic controversy\naside, and consider the metaphysics which is offered to us, the\nformalistic aspects one finds are twofold. Firstly, mathematical\nsentences are said to express \u2018pseudo-propositions\u2019, and\nso are devoid of truth value (only contingent propositions have a\ntruth value). Secondly, mathematics is described as a\n\u2018calculus\u2019 which is not to be used to represent the world\nas it is in itself but whose value is entirely instrumental. To be\nsure, the most explicit statement of this is not in the\nTractatus but in comments Wittgenstein wrote on\nRamsey\u2019s copy of it:\n\nThe fundamental idea of math. is the idea of calculus\nrepresented here by the idea of operation The beginning of\nlogic presupposes calculation and so number. Number is\nthe fundamental idea of calculus and must be introduced as\nsuch (Lewy, 1967: 421\u20132).\n\n\nIn the Tractatus proper we do get the idea that mathematical\npropositions are mere instruments (all of mathematics, not just an\n\u2018ideal\u2019 fragment, as in Hilbert):\n\nIndeed in real life a mathematical proposition is never what we want.\nRather, we make use of mathematical propositions only in inferences\nfrom propositions that do not belong to mathematics to others that\nlikewise do not belong to mathematics. (In philosophy the question,\n\u201cWhat do we actually use this word or this proposition\nfor?\u201d repeatedly leads to valuable insights.) Tractatus\n\u00b66.211.)\n\n\nThis idea is prefaced by the statements:\n\nMathematics is a logical method. The propositions of mathematics are\nequations, and therefore pseudo-propositions. (ibid, \u00b66.2)\n\n\nA proposition of mathematics does not express a thought. (ibid,\n\u00b66.21)\n\n\nCare must be taken, however. Wittgenstein distinguishes utterances\nwhich are sinnlos, which lack sense (including logical\ntautologies and contradictions here) from those which are\nunsinnig, nonsensical; it is not clear into which class\nmathematical utterances fall. One might well think that the game\nformalist should treat mathematical utterances, on that view just\nstrings of meaningless marks, as unsinnig, not just\nsinnlos. One clear difference from game formalism however is\nthis: for Wittgenstein mathematics should not be conceived of as a\ncalculus separate from other uses of language. Rather he attempts to\nshow that parts of arithmetic, at least, can be seen as grounded in\nnon-mathematical uses of language. Frege by contrast, whilst arguing\nthat a proper account of arithmetic (and analysis) should show how its\ngenerality enables one to give a uniform account of multifarious\ndifferent applications (cf. Dummett, 1991 Chapter 20) also argued\nstrongly for the view that mathematical utterances have a meaning\nindependent of, in conceptually prior to, their use in\napplications.\n\nWittgenstein attempts no theory of mathematics in the\nTractatus beyond arithmetic, a rather narrow fragment of\narithmetic at that. The theory clearly shares the anti-platonism of\nthe game formalist. There are no numbers, arithmetic is to be\nconstrued as a calculus in which one manipulates exponents or indices\nof operators. What is an operator? Wittgenstein distinguishes operator\nterms from function terms but commentators have struggled to explain\nwhat the distinction comes to. It is clear that Wittgenstein held that\ntwo occurrences of a function term \\(f\\) applied to different\nstrings \\(t\\) and \\(u\\) have different meanings, where by\n\u2018meaning\u2019 Wittgenstein means referent, something like\nFrege\u2019s Bedeutung. Thus \u2018\\(f\\)\u2019 in\n\u201c\\(f(t)\\)\u201d does not refer to the same entity\nas the outermost \\(f\\) in\n\u201c\\(f(f(t)\\)\u201d; this is supposed to\nbe the basis of the solution to Russell\u2019s paradox (\u00b63.333).\nIn particular \u2018the father of\u2019 in \u201cthe father of\nJohn\u201d, means something different there compared to its outermost\noccurrence in \u201cthe father of the father of John\u201d. There\ncan be no genuine iterated application of functions in other words, a\ncure for Russell\u2019s paradox that many will find about as bad as\nthe disease.\n\nOperators, however, are to be distinguished from functions in\nat least that aspect: genuine iteration of operators\u2014the\nsentential operators of propositional logic are a prime\nexample\u2014is possible without supposing a change of sense or\nreference from one token to the other. What is their meaning or\nreferent then? Wittgenstein denies they have any referents, this is a\ngeneralisation of his claim that the logical constants are not\nrepresentatives. Peter Hylton (1997: 96\u201398) argues that\nWittgenstein in the Tractatus has Russellian propositional\nfunctions in mind when he talks of \u2018functions\u2019 and is\nat pains to distinguish operators from these \u201csubstantial\u201d\nentities. Russellian propositional functions are not the same as\nordinary mathematical functions, the model for Frege\u2019s notion of\nfunction. Rather they are structured entities, structurally related to\nthe propositions which are their values\u2014 gappy states of affairs\nmight be one way to think of them. Operators, by contrast, do not\nstand for any such entity, they are not parts nor any sort of\ningredients of propositions, they \u201cleave no trace\u201d in\nthem. \n\nSentential operators are conceived as mapping not signs, nor\ninscriptions, to other signs and ascriptions but rather propositions,\n(in Wittgenstein\u2019s rather course-grained sense of the term) to\npropositions. On Wittgenstein\u2019s account of proposition, repeated\napplication of an operation such as negation \\(\\ldots p,\n{\\sim}p, {\\sim}{\\sim}p\\ldots\\) may take one back to an earlier\npoint. Nonetheless Wittgenstein attempts to explicate arithmetic in\nterms of sentential operators applied to non-mathematical language.\n(One can see intimations here of Church\u2019s later rigorous working\nout of a similar idea in his treatment of numbers in the lambda\ncalculus as functions which repeatedly apply input functions.) In\nslogan form, numbers are exponents of operations (ibid.,\n\u00b66.021). Thus where \\(\\Omega\\) is schematic for an operator and\n\\(\\Omega p\\) (or \\(\\Omega(p))\\) for its application to a\nproposition, then we can view the series\n\n\\[\np, \\Omega p, \\Omega \\Omega p, \\Omega \\Omega \\Omega p, \\Omega \\Omega \\Omega \\Omega p, \\ldots\n\\]\n\n\nas the starting point for a \u2018definition\u2019 of numbers, to be\nhad by rewriting it as\n\n\\[\n\\Omega^0 p, \\Omega^{0+1}p,\n\\Omega^{0+1+1}p,\n\\Omega^{0+1+1+1}p,\n\\Omega^{0+1+1+1+1}p,\\ldots.\n\\]\n\n\nHere, then, we have infinitely many schematic rewrite rules. Indices\nsuch as \u2018\\(^{0+1+1+1+1}\\)\u2019 can be abbreviated by\nnumerals in the obvious fashion, with\n\u2018\\(^{0+1+1+1+1}\\)\u2019 being abbreviated \u20184\u2019\nand so on.\n\nWittgenstein\u2019s examples show (though he did not explicitly state\nthis) that addition of two number/exponents\n\\(\\Omega^{n}p + \\Omega^{m}p\\) (likewise\n\\(\\Omega^{n+m}p)\\) is given by the\nrule:\n\n\\[\n\\Omega^{n}p + \\Omega^m p \\Rightarrow \\Omega^{n}(\\Omega^m p)\n\\]\n\n\ntelling us we may replace the expression on the left in a formula by\nthe one on the right.\n\nThis is what underlies the \u2018correctness\u2019 of identities\nsuch \\(n + m = r\\) except that for Wittgenstein\nno such identity expresses a truth. On his account, the identity sign\ndisappears in a full analysis of language, wherein sameness and\ndistinction are shown by sameness and distinctness of names, no two of\nwhich refer, in fully analysed language, to the same object (this view\ngives grounds for interpreting mathematical utterances in the\nTractatus as unsinnig). Wittgenstein himself did not\ntrouble to show that abandonment of an identity sign would not cripple\nthe expressive power of language but others such as Hintikka (1956)\nand Wehmeier (2004) have done so. What is left in the underlying\nlanguage, with identity excised, are substitution rules\n(Tractatus \u00b6 6.23).\n\nThese have to be interpreted in a general, and schematic, fashion.\nThus when we plug in \\({\\sim}\\) for \\(\\Omega\\), we find that (Wittgenstein had no\nintuitionist scruples here) a double application \\({\\sim}{\\sim}p\\) takes us\nback to (has the same sense as) \\(p\\). But this does not ground\nthe truth of \\(2 = 0\\), since for many other operations\n\\(\\Omega \\Omega p\\) is not equivalent to \\(p\\). On the other\nhand\n\n\\[\n\\Omega \\Omega(\\Omega \\Omega \\Omega p) \n  \\text{ always has the same sense as }\n  \\Omega \\Omega \\Omega(\\Omega \\Omega p)\n\\]\n\n\nWittgenstein implicitly assumes suitable rules for the interaction of\nbrackets with operators, in particular, generalised associativity. (In\nfact, he uses a mix of brackets and the notation\n\\(\\Omega 'p\\) to express \\(\\Omega(p)\\).)\n\nSince an equation \\(\\Omega^{n}p=\\Omega^{m}p\\) is, in its underlying\nlogical form, not a universal generalisation \\(\\forall n,m(\\Omega^{n}p\n= \\Omega^{m}p)\\) but a purely schematic generalisation, there is no\nform \\(\\exists n,m(\\Omega^{n}p \\ne \\Omega^{m}p)\\) with which we can\nexpress inequality, even if we can make sense of\n\u2018\\(\\ne\\)\u2019. Nor can we express the inequality \\(n \\ne m\\)\nschematically as the holding of the inequivalence of \\(\\Omega^n p\\)\nfrom \\(\\Omega^m p\\) for every choice for \\(\\Omega\\).  Otherwise \\(2\n\\ne 0\\) would fail since \\({\\sim}{\\sim}p\\) is equivalent to\n\\(p\\). The Tractarian theory cannot handle inequalities.\n\nSo much for addition and the limitations of its account of that\noperation. What of multiplication? Wittgenstein does define it, at\n\u00b66.241, by:\n\n\n\\[\n\\Omega^{n\\times m}p \\Rightarrow (\\Omega^n)^m p\n\\]\n\n\nbut to grasp this as a general principle we need to know how to\ninterpret the notation \\((\\Omega^n)^m\\). In more conventional\nmathematics, one might simply define \\((x^n)^m\\) as\n\\(x^{n\\times m}\\) but clearly this (or rather the equivalent\nfor the interaction of exponents of operators) would introduce a\ncircularity into Wittgenstein\u2019s account. Alternatively one could\nappeal to a recursive theory of exponents \u2013 \\(a^{m\\times 0}= a,\na^{m\\times(n+1)} = a^m + a^{m\\times n}\\). Since the principle of\ninduction needed to show that the recursion is coherent features\nnowhere in Wittgenstein\u2019s system, these rules would presumably\nhave to be taken as primitive. \n\nOverall, then, Wittgenstein in the Tractatus gives us no\naccount of mathematics in general other than for a fragment of\narithmetic, basically positive identities involving only addition. And\nthere he denies that the sentences express propositions with truth\nvalues. Of course the book was written under extraordinarily difficult\ncircumstances. Perhaps his account could have been developed further\nand more plausibly, despite the difficulties noticed above\u2014but\nfor some scepticism on that front, see Landini, 2007. Certainly\nWittgenstein made no attempt to do so whilst engaged with F.P. Ramsey\nand the Vienna Circle in the 1920s. If Wittgenstein\u2019s standpoint\nwas not capable of much further development, we have the choice of\neither abandoning all of mathematics except, at most, a fragment of\nthe arithmetic of addition; or else of rejecting the\nTractarian account. One does not need to be slavishly\nuncritical of contemporary mathematics to see what the reasonable\noption is here. Admittedly, rejecting the Tractatus account\nis also the option Wittgenstein himself seems to adopt at the end of\nthe book; here then we enter the issue of what the point is of taking\nus through such a bizarre and unconvincing theory in order to throw it\naway at the end. (For a more positive appraisal of\nWittgenstein\u2019s Tractarian position, see Floyd (2002).\n\n\nWittgenstein\u2019s later work on philosophy of mathematics, such as\nthe Remarks on the Foundations of Mathematics 1956/1978), for\na long time attracted even less approval than the Tractarian\naccount, though recently philosophers such as Juliet Floyd and Hilary\nPutnam have come to its defence as an interesting and informed account\nof mathematics (Floyd/Putnam, 2000). Its themes include the rejection\nof the actual infinite (indeed the tendency in his writings is\nstrongly finitist); the denial that undecidable sentences are\nmeaningful; a rejection of Cantor\u2019s powerset proof; the idea\nthat proof discovery changes the very meaning of the terms involved;\nand other very radical ideas. Among them we find a continued adherence\nto formalist motifs:\n\nIn mathematics everything is algorithm and nothing\nis meaning; (Philosophical Grammar: 468).\n\n\nAnother persistent theme in Wittgenstein\u2019s thought is that the\nmeaning of mathematics resides entirely in its utility in\nnon-mathematical applications. But there is no systematic theory of\nhow this applicability comes about, no proof of a conservative\nextension theorem, for example, showing how application of\nmathematical calculi to empirical premisses will never lead us to\nderive an empirical conclusion which does not follow from those\npremisses. And there is no resolution of the problem of the\nmetatheory. On the other hand, we should observe that these notes of\nWittgenstein on the philosophy of mathematics were not published by\nhim, but by others after his death. For an overall view of\nWittgenstein\u2019s philosophy of mathematics as a whole see\n Wittgenstein\u2019s philosophy of mathematics.\n4. Formalism and the Positivists\n\nWittgenstein greatly influenced the Vienna Circle. The\n\u2018official\u2019 positivist theory of mathematics, as it were,\nis not a formalist one. Mathematical theorems express truths, albeit\nin a special way: true by virtue of meaning alone. The most\ninfluential positivist has been Carnap, if one does not classify Quine\nas a positivist (but Quine\u2019s views, in the 1930s at any rate,\nwere very close to Carnap\u2019s, indeed arguably Quine remained\ntruer to Carnap\u2019s radical empiricism than Carnap did). And one\ncan certainly discern strong elements of formalism in some of\nCarnap\u2019s writings, for instance in Logische Syntax der\nSprache (1934 [1937]) and \u2018Empiricism, Semantics, and\nOntology\u2019 (1950 [1956]).\n\nThe former book was translated into English as The Logical Syntax\nof Language in 1937. In it, Carnap argued that the correct method\nin philosophy is to engage in conceptual analysis conceived of as\n\u2018logical syntax\u2019, roughly speaking syntax proper and proof\ntheory. To address philosophical differences, one proposes regimenting\nthe disputed positions in formal languages or \u2018frameworks\u2019\nwhich include a system of axioms and rules of proof; given these, some\nsentences are \u2018determinate\u2019, are provable or refutable.\nThese are the analytic, and contradictory, sentences, relative to that\nframework. How do we choose which system to adopt? Carnap\u2019s\nPrinciple of Tolerance (1934 [1937], p. 52) allows us to\nadopt any system we wish:\n\nIn logic, there are no morals. Everyone is at liberty to\nbuild up his own logic, i.e. his own form of language, as he wishes.\n[Italics in original]\n\n\nCarnaps extends this unbridled permissiveness to mathematics:\n\nThe tolerant attitude here suggested is, as far as special\nmathematical calculi are concerned, the attitude which is tacitly\nshared by the majority of mathematicians.\n\n\nAny such calculus can count as a piece of mathematics, even an\ninconsistent one. By downplaying or outright discarding semantic\nnotions, we simply bypass traditional ontological disputes concerning\nthe nature of the entities mathematics is \u2018about\u2019. The\nonly issue is the pragmatic utility, or otherwise, of any given\nmathematical calculus.\n\nA number of concerns arise here. How can Carnap distinguish between\nempirical, scientific theories, and mathematical ones? Secondly, if\npragmatic utility is primarily a matter of empirical applications, how\ndoes the Carnapian formalist know that a given calculus will\nconservatively extend empirical theory, how can this be known without\nappeal to meaningful mathematical results? Carnap writes:\n\nThe formalist view is right in holding that the construction of the\nsystem can be effected purely formally, that is to say without\nreference to the meaning of the symbols; \u2026 But the task which\nis thus outlined is certainly not fulfilled by the construction of a\nlogico-mathematical calculus alone. For this calculus does not contain\n\u2026 those sentences which are concerned with the application\nof mathematics \u2026 For instance, the sentence \u201cIn this\nroom there are now two people present\u201d cannot be derived from\nthe sentence \u201cCharles and Peter are in this room now and no one\nelse\u201d with the help of the logico-mathematical calculus alone,\nas it is usually constructed by the formalists; but it can be derived\nwith the help of the logicist system, namely on the basis of\nFrege\u2019s definition of \u20182\u2019. (Carnap 1934 [1937], p.\n326)\n\n\nadding (italics are Carnap\u2019s) \u2018A structure of this\nkind fulfils, simultaneously, the demands of both formalism and\nlogicism.\u2019\n\nBut what is to stop us freely stipulating, in accordance with the\nprinciple of tolerance, \u2018bridge principles\u2019 for operators\nwhich proof-theoretically behave like numerical operators\u2014\n\u2018the number of \\(\\phi\\)\u2019s\u2019\u2014via their definitional\noccurrence in formulations of arithmetic axioms and where the bridge\nprinciples include the likes of:\n\n\\[\\begin{align}\n\\text{the number of }\\phi\\text{\u2019s} &= 0 \\leftrightarrow \\exists x(\\phi x \\amp{\\sim}\\exists y(\\phi y \\amp y \\ne x)) \\\\\n\\text{the number of }\\phi\\text{\u2019s} &= 1 \\leftrightarrow{\\sim}\\exists x\\phi x\\, ?\n\\end{align}\\]\n\n\nThat is, we link the numeral for zero with a sentence stating there is\nexactly one entity of the appropriate type, the numeral for one with a\nsentence stating there are no such entities. If we do so, add the\nrules for standard decimal arithmetic, and then try to apply this\ncalculus, disaster will ensue; but do we not need a\ncontentful conservative extension result to show that for the\ncalculi we do use, no disaster can occur?\n\nG\u00f6del\u2019s incompleteness theorems pose very difficult\nproblems for Carnap in this and other regards. The first\nincompleteness theorem tells us that in any \\((\\omega\\)-) consistent\nformal theory whose theorems are recursively enumerable and which\nentails a certain (rather limited) amount of arithmetic, there will be\nan arithmetical sentence such that neither it nor its negation is\nprovable. In Carnap\u2019s terminology, this seems to yield\nnon-determinate sentences, which is a problem for him if we are\nconvinced that nonetheless some of these sentences are true; and\nindeed the key type of sentences used to prove the incompleteness\nresult\u2014\u2018G\u00f6del sentences\u2019\u2014are in fact true\nin the standard model of arithmetic if these sentences are constructed\nin an appropriate way (there are different ways of doing this) from a\ntheory itself true in that model.\n\nG\u00f6del himself wrote, but did not publish, a searching critique of\nCarnap\u2019s position (G\u00f6del, 1953\u20139). G\u00f6del focuses\nnot on his first incompleteness theorem but on the corollary he drew\nin his second theorem: that, under a certain natural characterization\nof the property of consistency, a characterization which can be given\nmathematically via his arithmetization of syntax, no formal theory of\nthe type G\u00f6del considered could prove its own consistency. He\nargued that Carnap, in order to make good his positivistic thesis that\nmathematical theorems are devoid of content, needed to give a\nconsistency proof for mathematical calculi in order to show that they\ndo not have empirical content, an abundance thereof indeed, by dint of\nentailing all empirical sentences. Warren Goldfarb notes, however,\n(1995: 328) that this point fails to appreciate the deep holism of\nCarnap\u2019s 1937 position where the distinction between analytic\nand synthetic is relative to the system in question, the\n\u2018linguistic framework\u2019. (This deep holism, of course, has\nthe counter-intuitive consequence that there is no\nframework-transcendent distinction between mathematics and empirical\nsciences.)\n\nCarnap, in fact, understood the import of G\u00f6del\u2019s theorems\n(Tennant, 2008); he knew of the results directly from G\u00f6del, who\nindeed read drafts of the Logical Syntax. Despite this he\ndisplayed what looks like remarkable insouciance with respect to its\nimplications for his position. He acknowledged the need, in\ndemonstrating consistency, to move to a stronger language (\u00a760c),\nand freely helped himself to mathematical techniques which could in no\nsense be classed as finitary (in \u00a714 he used, for example, rules\nwith infinitely many premisses, notably one which was later to be\ncalled the \\(\\omega\\)-rule). In this way he can deny, for arithmetic at\nleast, that there are any non-determinate sentences since every true\narithmetic sentence is provable using the \\(\\omega\\)-rule (relative to a\nfairly weak finitary logic, considerably weaker than classical\nlogic).\n\nCarnap\u2019s relaxed attitude stems from his abandonment of the\nsearch for epistemological foundations. If one hopes to secure our\nknowledge of mathematics by appeal to a formalist interpretation then\nthe search for a consistency proof of the type Hilbert sought makes\nsense and one will look for a vindication of mathematics as a whole\nfrom within a limited fragment with respect to which our knowledge\nseems hard to impugn. But Carnap, perhaps as a result of\nG\u00f6del\u2019s deep theorems, seems to have abandoned that goal\nand thought that the Principle of Tolerance absolved him of any such\nneed. One can stipulate what one likes, including stronger axiom\nsystems from which one can prove the consistency of a weaker theory.\nThis does not give any firmer grounds for believing or accepting the\nweaker theory, but one does not need such grounds anyway.\n\nFew nowadays look for Cartesian certitude in mathematics, so\nCarnap\u2019s position here may seem reasonable. It is not so clear,\nhowever, that he has answered the problem of applicability. Even if a\nconservative extension result can only be given in a more powerful\nsystem, we need the result to be a contentful truth, not just a string\nof symbols we can derive from some system, if we are to have\nreassurance that a particular calculus we are about to use in\ndesigning bridges or computers will be pragmatically useful. And if\nthe Carnapian grants that the result is a contentful truth, we can ask\nwhat, according to this formalistic position, constitutes that truth.\nCarnap, to be sure, was motivated by a horror of becoming embroiled in\nmetaphysical disputation. But if his standpoint is emptied not only of\nepistemological ambition but is so deflationistic as to say little\nmore than that metamathematical techniques can be applied to\nformalisations of mathematical and scientific theories then it is also\nemptied of all philosophical interest and ceases to make an\nintervention in the debates in philosophy of mathematics.\n\nNot that Carnap really is abandoning metaphysics: this erstwhile\nopponent of metaphysics is really a brother metaphysician with a rival\ntheory of his own, as F. H. Bradley might have said. Thus the main\nimport of the later \u2018Empiricism, Semantics, and Ontology\u2019\nis the dismissal of ontological worries as pseudo-problems by dint of\nthe (highly contentious) distinction between \u2018internal\u2019\nquestions, to be settled by the rules of the framework\u2014of\nmathematics, ordinary \u2018thing\u2019 talk or whatever\u2014and\n\u2018external\u2019 questions such as \u2018which framework to\nadopt?\u2019. To these external questions there correspond, Carnap\nclaimed, no propositions with truth values; to no such question, for\nexample, is there a true answer of the form: \u201cYes, infinitely\nmany abstract numbers exist\u201d. Rather, they are to be answered by\ndecisions, decisions to adopt or not based on pragmatic\ncriteria regarding the efficiency, fruitfulness and utility of the\nframework with respect to the aims of the discourse in question. But\nwhat aims could these be? Predicting the flow of \u2018sense\ndata\u2019, taken for granted as forming the ultimate furniture of\nthe world? If so, we see that the vaunted ontological neutrality is a\nsham and we have a radical form of empiricist anti-realist\nmetaphysics.\n\nThe vestige of formalism lies in this: Carnap takes\n\u2018correctness\u2019 to be determined by rules which govern a\nsystem and not to consist, for example, in correspondence with a realm\nof facts independent of the system of rules. And he thinks this\napproach dissolves ontological worries and frees us from any\nobligation to explain how finite, flesh-and-blood creatures like\nourselves could come to have detailed knowledge of this independent\nrealm of facts, this domain of configurations of abstract,\nnon-temporal, non-causal objects and properties, a realm exposed by\nCarnap as a metaphysical illusion. One strong disanalogy with\nformalism is that Carnap takes this line with all areas of\ndiscourse, not just mathematics.\n5. Nominalist Formalism\n\nW. V. Quine famously rejected the positivist\u2019s doctrine of truth\nin virtue of meaning and the quasi-logicist conception of mathematics\nas a body of analytic truths (and, partly as a result, also rejected\nhis mentor Carnap\u2019s internal/external distinction). Quine, in\nconjunction with Nelson Goodman, produced instead what amounts to a\nformalist manifesto. His formalist phase does not seem to have lasted\nvery long: he later settled on a form of mathematical platonism,\ndownplaying, if not largely ignoring, his relatively youthful\nflirtation with \u2018nominalism\u2019. But while it lasted he and\nGoodman greatly advanced the discussion of formalism by tackling\nhead-on the questions which other formalists shirked or ignored.\n\nGoodman and Quine\u2019s \u2018Steps towards a constructive\nnominalism\u2019 (1947) sets forth an uncompromising game\nformalism:\n\nThe gains which seem to have accrued to natural science from the use\nof mathematical formulas do not imply that these formulas are true\nstatements. No one, not even the hardiest pragmatist, is likely to\nregard the beads of an abacus as true; and our position is that the\nformulas of platonistic mathematics are, like the beads of an abacus,\nconvenient computational aids which need involve no question of truth.\n(p. 122).\n\n\nThey regard\n\nthe sentences of mathematics merely as strings of marks without\nmeaning\n\n\nso that\n\nsuch intelligibility as mathematics possesses derives from the\nsyntactical or metamathematical rules governing those marks. (p. 111)\n\n\nCommendably, Goodman and Quine do not shy away from the metatheory\nproblem, the difficulty that syntax and metamathematics itself seems\nas ontologically rich and committed to abstract objects as arithmetic.\nOn the contrary, they face it squarely and attempt to make do entirely\nwith an ontology of concrete objects, finitely many such objects in\nfact. (However they do assume fairly powerful mereological principles,\nessentially universal composition: they assume that any fusion of\nobjects, however scattered or diffuse, is also an object in good\nstanding.)\n\nWith much ingenuity they try to develop a syntax which \u201cwill\ntreat mathematical expressions as concrete objects\u201d\n(ibid.)\u2014as actual strings of physical marks\u2014and\ngive concrete surrogates for notions such as \u2018formula\u2019,\n\u2018axiom\u2019 and \u2018proof\u2019 as platonistically\ndefined. However they do not address the issue of the application of\nmathematics, construed in this concrete, formalistic fashion.\n\nIn addition to the applicability problem, there are two further\ncrucial problems for formalism as developed by Goodman and Quine.\nFirstly it is not clear that they are entitled to the general claims\nthey make about syntax, construed as a theory about certain concrete\nmarks and fusions of marks. Thus when arguing that their definition of\nformula in terms of \u2018quasi-formula\u2019 gives us the results\nwe want, they say:\n\nBy requiring also the next more complex alternative denials in\n\\(x\\) to be alternative denials of quasi-formulas, the definition\nguarantees these also will be formulas in the intuitively intended\nsense; and so on, to \\(x\\) itself. (p. 116)\n\n\n(\u2018Alternative denial\u2019 is the Sheffer stroke operation\n\\(P|Q\\) which is true if and only if one component is\nfalse.) The problem lies with the \u2018and so on\u2019. Goodman and\nQuine are trying to work their way up through an arbitrary formula\nshowing that their definition will ensure that each larger component\nis a formula. It is not clear how we can have a guarantee of this for\narbitrary \\(x\\), without something like induction over formula\ncomplexity; but this is not available as formulas are not generated in\nthe usual inductive set-theoretic fashion. Similar remarks apply to\nthe demonstration that proofs, as defined nominalistically on p. 120,\nhave the internal order of precedence among immediate sub-premisses\nand conclusions that we intuitively expect. The demonstration proceeds\nwith a generalisation over all numbers \\(k\\) which number the\naxioms in a concrete proof and then performs a sequence of selections\non them. This seems to presuppose the truth of generalisations over\nall numbers and indeed countable choice, resources unavailable to a\nstrict nominalist.\n\nSecondly, what can Goodman and Quine say about a sentence such as\n\n\\[\n2^{2^{2^{2^{ 2^2} }}}+1 \\text{ is prime}\\,?\n\\]\n\n\n(That is\u2014with \u20182^\\(n\\)\u2019 representing \u20182 to\nthe power \\(n\\)\u2019\u2014\u2018[2^(2^(2^(2^(2^2))))]\\(+1\\) is\nprime\u2019; cf. Tennant, 1997 p. 152.) They cannot deny the sentence\nexists, for there is the token before our very eyes. But there are\nstrong grounds for thinking that no concrete proof or disproof will\nexist, for the only methods available may use up more time, space and\nmaterial than any human could have at her disposal, perhaps than\nactually exists. There are countless sentences with this property:\nconcrete tokens of them exist but no concrete proof or refutation\nactually exists, none that a human could manipulate as a meaningful\nutterance anyway. (Cf. Boolos, 1987.) Formalists of Goodman and\nQuine\u2019s persuasion seem forced to the conclusion that sentences\nlike the above, sentences which are decidable in the usual formal\nsense, are neither true nor false, since neither (concretely) provable\nnor refutable. To embrace this view, however, would be to butcher\nmathematics as currently practiced; such a consequence should rather\nbe viewed as a reductio ad absurdum of their position.\n6. Term Formalism: Curry\n\nThe most substantive attempt at a non-Hilbertian formalist philosophy\nof mathematics is Haskell Curry\u2019s book Outline of a\nFormalist Philosophy of Mathematics (Curry, 1951). Curry is no\ngame formalist, his position is closer to term formalism, of the two\nviews we started out from. Curry\u2019s philosophy of mathematics,\nhowever, is, or attempts to be, a highly anti-metaphysical one, at\nleast to the extent that he thinks he can remain neutral on the issue\nof the ontological commitments of mathematics.\n\nMathematics can be conceived as a science in such a way as to be\nindependent of any except the most rudimentary philosophical\nhypotheses. (p. 3)\n\n\nHence he is not motivated by an anti-platonist horror of abstract\nobjects. His neutrality, indeed, is somewhat compromised by the fact\nthat Curry is perfectly happy to commit to an infinite ontology of\npresumably abstract expression types. Officially he evinces\ndisinterest in what the primitives\u2014he misleadingly calls them\n\u2018tokens\u2019\u2014of his formal systems are:\n\nWe can take for those tokens any objects we please, and similarly we\ncan take for operators any ways of combining these objects which have\nthe requisite formal properties. (p. 28)\n\n\nBut since for many systems there are infinitely many primitive\n\u2018tokens\u2019, they cannot all be identified with concrete\nmarks which mathematicians have actually produced.\n\nLike the term formalist, Curry takes mathematics, properly\nreconstructed after philosophical reflection, to have an essentially\nsyntactic subject matter, namely formal systems. Unlike Frege\u2019s\nadversaries, though, Curry, writing after the development of the\ndiscipline of metamathematics, is able to give a far more rigorous\n(albeit in his case somewhat eccentric) account of what a formal\nsystem is.\n\nNo restrictions are placed on what form the axioms, rules and\ntherefore theorems of a formal system are to be. Truth for elementary\npropositions of a formal system consists simply in their provability\nin the system. One of his formal systems (Example 7, p. 23) has only\none predicate \u201ca unary predicate expressed by G\u00f6del by the\nwords \u2018ist beweisbar\u2019\u201d (p. 23), i.e., a provability\npredicate. The elementary truths of this system can be interpreted as\nclaims about provability in the underlying system. Any formal system\nof the usual sort could be \u2018reduced\u2019 into one in which\nthere is only one provability predicate and truth (= provability) in\nthe reducing system of the elementary proposition \\(\\vdash \\langle\n\\phi \\rangle\\) holds only when \\(\\phi\\) is provable in the reduced\nsystem (pp. 34\u201335). Curry allows that one can form compounds\nfrom elementary propositions by means of the usual logical operators\nin order to express complex propositions in the language of proof\ntheory (Chapter IX).\n\nThe upshot is that mathematics in general becomes metamathematics, a\ncontentful theory\u2014Curry\u2019s sentences express propositions\nwith truth values\u2014setting out the truths about what is provable\nfrom what in underlying formal systems whose interpretation, or rather\ninterpretations, are not taken to be mathematically important. This\nstandpoint, however, threatens to collapse into structuralism, into\nviewing mathematical utterances as schemata implicitly generalising\nover a range of (in general) abstract structures which satisfy the\nschemata. As to the problem of the metatheory, Curry does not seek to\nanswer this; there is no real attempt to avoid commitment to a rich\nontology of objects, except that, by considering only standard formal\nsystems, one could make do with a countable ontology which can play\nthe role of linguistic expressions. Only, however, at the cost of\ngrossly distorting mathematical practice. Set theorists, topologists,\nanalysts et al. entertain conjectures, and try to prove things\n\u2018about\u2019 sets, topological spaces, functions on the complex\nnumbers and so on. In their philosophical moments they may wonder just\nwhat the concepts they are wrestling with are \u2018about\u2019, but\nthey do not in general entertain conjectures or try to prove things\n\u2018about\u2019 expression strings, except where it is of\ninstrumental value to them in proving things about sets, spaces, the\ncomplex plane and so on (cf. Resnik pp. 70\u201371).\n7. The Curry-Howard Correspondence\n\nHaskell Curry was also to play an important role in\ndevelopments linking logic to computer science which some argue can\nlend support to formalism in mathematics. His work on combinatory\nlogic along with work of W.A. Howard\u2019s led to the\n\u2018Curry-Howard correspondence\u2019 (\u2018Curry-Howard\u2019\nhenceforth written \u2018CH\u2019) or \u2018CH isomorphism\u2019\nlinking logic, proof theory and computer science.\n\nCurry intended to provide a general theory of functionality as part of\na foundation for logic, \u201cpre-logic\u201d, as Curry called it.\nSee in particular (Curry 1934) and, with Robert Feys, (Curry and Feys\n1958). At around the same time as Curry\u2019s first publications in\nthe area, Alonzo Church developed his untyped \\(\\lambda\\)-calculus, also\ndesigned to provide a foundation for logic, indeed mathematics more\ngenerally, and also taking functions, very generally applicable, as\nfundamental. In these functional calculi, (for a comprehensive account\nsee Barendregt (1984), also the entry on\n the lambda calculus)\n a concatenation \\(fg\\) is used to represent the application of\nfunction \\(f\\) to argument \\(g\\) yielding an output value, where\nboth argument and value can themselves be functions and where\nself-application is allowed. Whereas Curry\u2019s system is\nvariable-free, variable binding in Church\u2019s occurs by means of\nthe \\(\\lambda\\) term, the variable \\(x\\) if and where it occurs in\n\\(N\\) being bound in \\(\\lambda x.N\\). The fundamental\noperation in \\(\\lambda\\)-calculus is \\(\\beta\\)-reduction, the transformation\nwhich takes us from \\((\\lambda x.N)M\\) to\n\\(N[x := M].\\) Here \\(N[x := M]\\) is\nthe result of substituting \\(M\\) for all free occurrences of\n\\(x\\) in\n \\(N\\).[1]\n So, for example, \\((\\lambda x.xx)f\\) \\(\\beta\\)-reduces\nto \\(ff\\). We can write this as: \n\n\\[\n(\\lambda x.xx)f \\rhd ff\n\\]\n\n\nThus these calculi achieve what Wittgenstein in the Tractatus\n(see above) seems to be gesturing at in his operations/function\ndistinction, for in Church and Curry we have a fully developed theory\nof \u2018operations\u2019, that is functions which can take\nfunctions as arguments and values. Of course self-application, as in\nthe infinite looping \\(\\beta\\)-reduction:\n\n\\[\\begin{align}\n(\\lambda x.xx)(\\lambda x.xx) &\\rhd (\\lambda x.xx)(\\lambda x.xx) \\\\\n &\\rhd (\\lambda x.xx)(\\lambda x.xx) \\\\\n &\\vdots\n\\end{align}\\]\n\n\nraises worries that paradox may emerge. Church thought that eschewing\nthe use of free variables and restricting excluded middle (Church,\n1932: 346\u20137) blocked paradox but Kleene and Rosser showed\n(1935), using a strategy based on Richard\u2019s paradox, that the\nsystem was trivial: every formula could be derived using the rules.\nChurch fixed this up to produce a consistent untyped \\(\\lambda\\)\ncalculus, but the important step with regard to the CH correspondence\nwas the development of typed \\(\\lambda\\) calculi.\n\nNow \u2018type\u2019 is a very overworked word. Tokens of that type,\nto use one of its meanings (roughly as abstract syntactic object),\nhave sometimes been used to stand for properties, including\nhigher-order properties, as in Russell\u2019s various type theories.\nChurch was to continue this tradition in his simple typed version of\n\\(\\lambda\\)-calculus (Church, 1940). In this usage, types, such as the\nproperty of caninity or of being a shape, have instances such as Fido,\nin the first case, or the lower-order property of being square in the\nsecond case. Thus instances of types in this sense need not be\nabstract entities. Another usage is syntactic, as when the basic\nexpressions of a language are divided into various disjoint categories\n(\u2018types\u2019) and formation rules for generating well-formed\nexpressions are set down making use of the type distinctions. In this\nusage \u2018type\u2019 is an expression in the syntactic metatheory\nof the language of some object theory. In some cases the syntactic\ntheory is in fact part of the object theory under discussion.\nIndependently of this, some presentations of syntactic type theories\n\u2018push down\u2019 the syntactic metatheory into the object\ntheory under discussion by stipulating that the well-formed\nexpressions of the object language contain syntactic proper parts,\ntags as it were, which are correlated with the metatheoretic type of\nthe expression and have no semantic role. In Howard (1969), for\nexample, the well-formed formula of the conditional fragment of\npropositional logic are used as type symbols superscripting terms of\nthe type theory. \n\nThe expression \u00ab\\(N: \\tau\\)\u00bb which is usually read\nalong the lines of: \n\n\\[\n\\text{term } N \\text{ is of type } \\tau\n\\]\n\n\ncan be, therefore, read in a number of ways, for example: \n\nI: Non-syntactic: the entity referred to by \\(N\\) is an instance of\nthe class/set/property referred to by \\(\\tau\\), an instance which need\nnot be syntactic nor, more generally, abstract. \n\nII: Meta-syntactic: the expression referred to by \\(N\\) is an\ninstance of the syntactic category \\(\\tau\\). The syntactic theory in\nwhich the ascription of term to type occurs is \u2018meta\u2019,\nrelative to a background intellectual context, in that it is not there\npresented as (under its intended interpretation) part of a more\ngeneral, non-syntactic theory expressed in a language for which it\nitself provides the syntax. \n\nIII: Syntactic: the expression \\(N\\) is an instance of the\nsyntactic category \\(\\tau\\) and the type theory \\(is\\) a syntactic\ntheory for the language which it itself belongs to. \n\nWhilst some textbooks on type theory can seem, to the logician, to be\nrather hazy on exactly which, if any, of the above interpretations of\n\u2018type\u2019 is at issue this is certainly not generally the\ncase with the pioneers of these theories. Howard, for example, writes\nin his classic paper \u2018The Formula-as-Types Notion of\nConstruction\u2019:\n\nThe title has a second defect; namely, a type should be\nregarded as a [sic] abstract object whereas a formula is the\nname of a type. (1969: 479)\n\n\nand distinguishes between types and type symbols (480).\n\nThere are non-syntactic models of various type theories, though these\nwere developed later, for example (Scott, 1970), and make fairly\nstrong set-theoretic cardinality assumptions, such as the existence of\ninaccessible cardinals. Much more relevant for the formalist are\n\u2018term models\u2019, syntactic models similar to the\ninterpretations of languages which make use of their own symbols as\nthe members of the domain, interpretations to be found in Henkin\ncompleteness proofs; and especially \u2018syntactic semantic\u2019\napproaches, as in some interpretations of Per Martin-L\u00f6f\u2019s\nintuitionist type theory (see the entry on\n intuitionistic type theory),\n or the \u2018proof-theoretic semantics\u2019 of Peter\nSchroeder-Heister\n (see the entry on proof-theoretic semantics)\n which eschew attempts to give meanings to types and terms by\nreference to \u2018external\u2019 truth-conditions: mathematical\nlanguage is not to be taken as a representation of some independent\nreality. \n\nIn such a context, the distinction between meta-syntactic and\nsyntactic readings of \u2018type\u2019 is not very important. Even\nif \u2018type\u2019 is taken to be a purely metatheoretic notion,\nthe axioms and rules of inference of type theory enable us to prove\nmeta-theorems about types. The situation can be compared to the\nrelation between sequent calculus and natural deduction, with the\nturnstile \\(\\vdash\\) of the former interpretable as a relation of\nderivability in some underlying natural deduction system, and the\nsequent calculus providing higher-order theorems about object language\nderivability. Thus whether or not one thinks of types as\nmeta-theoretic notions, the calculi of type theory are such that one\ncan prove theorems to the effect that term \\(N\\) is of type \\(\\tau\\).\n\n\nNow Curry\u2019s work in (1934) and more fully with Feys in (1958)\nhad shown a certain correspondence between provable formulae in the\ntheory of the conditional and the types of basic combinators in type\ntheory. In particular, with \\(\\rightarrow\\) as the conditional and\n\\(\\alpha \\Rightarrow \\beta\\) representing function types, that is\ntypes (construed non-syntactically) whose inputs are type \\(\\alpha\\)\nfunctions and outputs type \\(\\beta\\) functions, we have, (here\n\\(\\vdash_{T\\rightarrow}\\) means provability in the positive\n(non-relevantist) theory of the conditional and \\(\\vdash_{CL}\\) means\nprovability in a suitable combinatory logic): \n\n\n\\[\n\\vdash_{T\\rightarrow} \\mathrm{A} \\rightarrow \\mathrm{B} \\text{ iff for some }\nN, \\vdash_{CL} N : \\alpha \\Rightarrow \\beta\n\\]\n\n\nwhere \\(N\\) is a term built from basic combinators and \\(\\alpha\\) is\nstructurally isomorphic to A (likewise \\(\\beta\\) to B). That is, one\ncan generate A \\(\\Rightarrow\\) B from A \\(\\rightarrow\\) B by replacing\neach occurrence of \\(\\rightarrow\\) by \\(\\Rightarrow\\), given a uniform\nsubstitution (perhaps the trivial identity one) of sentential letters\nin the formulae of the propositional language by names for basic\ntypes. \n\nCurry and Feys (1958) extended the correspondence idea to one between\ntype theory and Gentzen\u2019s sequent calculus. In the paper already\ncited, circulated in 1969, but only published in a volume in a\nFestschrift for Curry in 1980, W.A. Howard (1969) deepened the CH\ncorrespondence by demonstrating a correspondence between\nintuitionistic sequent form natural deduction and type theory in\n\\(\\lambda\\)-calculus format, generalising to encompass intuitionist\narithmetic- \u2018Heyting arithmetic\u2019 (HA)- (thus requiring an\nextension from all of propositional to predicate logic), all as part\nof a project of investigation of the constructivist notion of a\nconstruction. Howard deepened the results by making clear not only a\ncorrespondence between provable formulae in the sequent calculus and\ntype ascriptions, but also between the terms in the type ascriptions\nand proofs of the corresponding\n formulae.[2]\n For example, (to the horror of relevantists) A \\(\\rightarrow\\) (B\n\\(\\rightarrow\\) A) is provable in T\\(_{\\rightarrow}\\). The\ncorresponding type is \\(\\alpha \\Rightarrow(\\beta \\Rightarrow\n\\alpha)\\), the type of the basic operator K, whose action is \n\n\\[\nNM \\rhd N\n\\]\n\n\nand whose \\(\\lambda\\) representation is\n\\((\\lambda x.(\\lambda y.x))\\) (usually abbreviated\n\\(\\lambda xy.x)\\), as can be seen by the \\(\\beta\\)-reduction\n chain:[3]\n\n\\[\n(\\lambda x.(\\lambda y.x)N)M \\rhd (\\lambda y.N)M \\rhd N.\n\\]\n\n\nThe simplest proof of A \\(\\rightarrow\\) (B \\(\\rightarrow\\) A) in T\\(_{\\rightarrow}\\) is:\n\n\n\\[\n\\dfrac{\\dfrac{\\dfrac{}{A}\\scriptsize{1}}{B \\to A}}{A \\to (B \\to A)}\\scriptsize{1}\n\\]\n\nFigure 1\n\n\nin which the second step, to the intermediate conclusion B \\(\\rightarrow\\) A,\nis an instance of \\(\\rightarrow\\)I(ntroduction) with vacuous discharge of the\nunassumed antecedent B (in a sequent calculus version, the rule of\nthinning, adding extra assumptions in the sequent antecedent, would be\nused). The type theoretic proof in type theory\n TT[4]\n of the construction of a term \u201cinhabiting\u201d the type \\(\\alpha\n \\Rightarrow(\\beta \\Rightarrow \\alpha)\\) takes the form: \n\n\\[\n\\dfrac{\\dfrac{\\dfrac{}{x:\\alpha}\\scriptsize{x}}{\\lambda y.x:\\beta \\Rightarrow \\alpha}}{\\lambda xy.x:\\alpha \\Rightarrow (\\beta \\Rightarrow \\alpha)}\\scriptsize{x}\n\\]\n\nFigure 2\n\n\nHere \\(\\lambda\\) abstraction, the introduction of \\(\\lambda\\) terms,\ncorresponds to \\(\\rightarrow\\)I, so the \\(\\lambda\\) term\n\\(\\lambda xy.x\\) which is shown to have type \\(\\alpha \\Rightarrow \n(\\beta \\Rightarrow \\alpha)\\) \u2018codes\u2019 two steps of the type\ncorrelate of \\(\\rightarrow\\)I, namely the rule \\(\\Rightarrow\\)I introducing function\ntypes, and we can recover the above proof of the propositional\ntheorem. Moreover given the tight connection between type theoretical\ncalculi and programs in certain types of programming languages, we can\nalso see the TT proof as a program of steps in the construction of a\ncertain type of computational object.\n\nIn natural deduction systems, normalisation is the procedure by which\nredundant inferential loops are eliminated. In certain logics (such as\nintuitionistic logic), a normalisation metatheorem holds and tells us\nthat any proof can be stripped of its redundancy and reduced to a\nnormal form. A further level of correspondence, brought out by Howard,\nlinks normalisation with the \u2018evaluation\u2019 of programs in\nwhich complex terms are reduced to their simplest forms (this is not\nalways possible in the more expressively powerful type systems). \n\nIt seems to be Kreisel who introduced the slogan \u2018formulae as\ntypes\u2019, with Martin-L\u00f6f responsible for the more widespread\n\u2018propositions as types\u2019 slogan (See again, Wadler, 2015).\nIn the philosophical context, \u2018proposition\u2019 is often used\nto mean something like the meaning of a sentence, i.e. of a formula of\na certain sort. Using this terminology, a widespread intuitionist\nposition is that that the proposition expressed by a formula is the\nset (or species, for the intuitionist) of all proofs of the formula.\nGiven that different provable formulae will correspond to different\ntypes, the CH correspondence allows us to rephrase this\n\u2018syntactico-semantics\u2019 position as: the proposition\nexpressed by a formula of HA is the type of its proofs, where\n\u2018type\u2019 is not a straightforward synonym for\n\u2018set\u2019 or \u2018species\u2019 but the notion from\n\\(\\lambda\\)-calculus. As noted, this calculus is a formal system with\nrich interconnections with programming and computer science and\nreadings in which the instances of types are purely syntactic, for\nexample proof-theoretic entities. Hence the meaning of a formula, the\nproposition expressed, on such readings, does not represent a reality\ndistinct from the linguistic system in which the formula occurs. \n\nThe connection with intuitionism, then, is clear: but what is the\nrelevance of the CH correspondence to formalism? There are, in the\nfirst place, clear overlaps between some forms of intuitionism and\ncertain formalist positions. Not the philosophical intuitionism of the\nfounding father Brouwer, of course, with its ontology of mathematical\nobjects as mental constructions and an epistemology in which\nmathematical knowledge is based on internal reflection on the\nsuccession of ideas; this is a mathematical metaphysics far removed\nfrom formalism. But many constructivists have embraced, without\naccepting his metaphysics, the Brouwerian identification, or close\nlinkage, of mathematical correctness (truth, if one is prepared to\nspeak of mathematical truth) with provability. This sort of\nidentification is more than congenial to a certain brand of formalism,\none which rejects the idea that mathematical theses represent a\nmind-independent reality and which also divides the sheep from the\ngoats on the basis of those which are provable, in some formal system,\nversus those which are disprovable.\n\nBut there are also substantial differences between the intuitionist\nand the formalist. For one thing, not only Brouwer but also many later\nconstructivists refuse to identify provability with provability in\nsome formal system. For another, formalists have generally felt free\nto help themselves to classical logic, and have emphasised the free\ncreativity of the mathematician: she should be free to generate\nwhatever mathematical theories she wishes, subject only to withdrawing\nthem if they turn out to be inconsistent (in the chosen background\nlogic). \n\nOn the first point the formalist will, of course, be a formalist! She\nwill link correctness, at least at the most fundamental level, to\nformal proof. Here, then, the CH correspondence, or better\ncorrespondences, are surely very attractive to the formalist. The\nlinkage between propositions and computations, algorithmic reductions\nof terms coding proofs to irreducible normal forms in particular, fits\nvery snugly with those versions of formalism which take mathematics to\nbe, at heart, shuffling of symbols with no external reference.\n\nOn the second point, further work on the CH correspondences\ngeneralised the results from intuitionistic logic to a wide variety of\nother logics, in particular to classical logic (Griffin, 1990), as\nwell as to other logical frameworks such as modal logic and linear\nlogic. There is no burdensome logical restriction imposed by\n\u2018Formulae-as-Types\u2019 then, no need for the formalist to\nfight with one hand tied behind her back.\n\nWhat of the free creativity the formalist cherishes? Constructivist\ntype theory has, of course, been extended well beyond Heyting\narithmetic, particularly ambitious extensions are to be found in the\nunivalent foundations project based on homotopy type theory (Awodey,\n2014). This, then, is an avenue a formalism based on Formulae-as-Types\nmight pursue. But for a formalist who wishes to be non-revisionist\nabout non-constructivist mathematics the prospects are perhaps less\nclear. It is not enough just to add in the extra axioms or inference\nrules which yield the particular theory, in a standard framework, e.g.\nof a first-order or higher-order language. For one needs to do the\nfurther work needed to show that an extension of the CH correspondence\nobtains in this system. \n\nMoreover there is also an issue with primeness in the sense of the\nproof-theoretic property (which intuitionist logic satisfies) that\nwhen \\(\\vdash\\) A \\(\\vee\\) B then either \\(\\vdash\\) A or \\(\\vdash\\) B. Classical\ntheories typically do not have this property and this will pose\nproblems for generalising the CH correspondence and for justifying\nexcluded middle (assuming the formalist does not simply take all\nnon-trivial calculi as legitimate without need of justification). If\ncorrectness of a mathematical claim, relative to a particular\nframework, is identified with provability and if a disjunction can be\ncorrect where neither disjunct is provable then the formalist would\nseem to require some fancy footwork\u2014supervaluationalism is not\nobviously appropriate here\u2014to justify using classical logic.\n\n\nThere is also the problem of applicability, which Frege thought an\ninsuperable one for formalists. What can the meaning be of applied\nmathematical notions, such as \u00abthe number of \\(\\phi\\)s\u00bb,\nwhere mathematical and non-mathematical discourse is mixed together?\nUnless the formalist wishes to go down the Dummettian anti-realist\nroute and generalise the notion of proof to a notion of verification\nappropriate for empirical language, she will have to find a way of\ncombining, without too much ad hocness, a proof-theoretic semantics\nfor pure mathematics with a different, perhaps a realist,\ntruth-conditional semantics, for empirical language. \n\nFinally it should be noted that CH formalism, if we can call it such,\nwill be unacceptable to the formalist who is motivated by\nanti-platonist concerns and wishes to exclude abstract objects from\nall mathematics, including metamathematics. For the meanings of\nconcrete utterances of mathematical formulae, according to CH\nformalism, are sets/species/types of proofs, and the latter are\nabstract objects, infinitely many of them, of arbitrarily long finite\nlength. The problem of the metatheory, in other words, has not been\nmet. The anti-platonist cannot straightforwardly lift the ideas of\nsyntactico-semantics and apply the CH correspondence in support of\nanti-platonism; a great deal more philosophical work is required.\n8. Contemporary Formalism\n\nLater developments have been primarily in the \u2018Hilbertian\u2019\nwing of the formalist movement. P. J. Cohen\u2019s work on the\ngeneralised continuum hypothesis showed, in tandem with\nG\u00f6del\u2019s relative consistency proof, that it and countless\nrelated set-theoretic propositions concerning the relations of the\ncardinality of a set to that of its powerset are undecidable by\ncurrent axioms. With no obvious, non-ad hoc, ways to extend the axioms\nto decide these questions, this led some mathematicians, such as Cohen\nhimself (Cohen, 1971) and Abraham Robinson, (Robinson, 1965; 1969) to\ndespair of a realistic interpretation of higher set theory. They\ntherefore treat branches of mathematics in which no plausible axiom\nset will decide the key questions as \u2018ideal\u2019 parts of\nmathematics, lacking the content to be found in other areas.\n\nAs to game formalism, although philosophers may accuse mathematicians\nof a tendency to lapse into this seemingly discredited position, very\nfew philosophers advance views resembling the game formalists. Gabbay\n(2010) and Azzouni (2004; 2005; 2006; 2009) have flown under the\nformalist flag. Gabbay\u2019s formalism (which he develops only with\nrespect to arithmetic in the paper cited) occupies \u2018lush middle\nground between traditional formalism, fictionalism, logicism and\nrealism\u2019 (Gabbay, 2010: 219). Moreover he writes \u2018Contrary\nto traditional (game) formalism, my proposal shall not involve an\nattempt to provide formal derivations of each and every arithmetic\ntruth\u2019 (Gabbay, 2010: 221).\n\nAzzouni describes his \u2018version of formalism\u2019 (Azzouni,\n2004: 105) as one in which ordinary mathematical proofs\n\u2018indicate\u2019 formal derivations. The indication relation is\nleft rather open: Azzouni does not claim that the indicated\nderivations all belong to a single formal system; rather ordinary\nproofs can indicate derivations from a \u2018family\u2019 of formal\nderivations. However, the indicated derivations, Azzouni says need not\nexist; certainly concrete tokens of them need not exist in the same\nperiod as the informal proofs which indicate them. Proofs in ancient\nGreek geometry indicate 21st century or later derivations. They may\nnever, in fact, exist\u2014they may be too long ever to be written\ndown (Azzouni, 2006: 154) though these non-existent proofs are\nsupposed to explain the consensus among mathematicians about which\ninformal proofs are correct! In later work Azzouni seems to retreat\nfrom this (or any) brand of formalism:\n\nI kept falling (against my will) into a view that mathematicians had\nto be engaged in something like sophisticated syntactic\npattern-recognition while perusing informal mathematical proofs, so\nthat they would be sensitive (without realizing it) to a background of\nnonexistent formal derivations. (Azzouni, 2009: 25)\n\n\nmoving to an \u2018inference package\u2019 view of mathematical\nreasoning which does not seem formalist: see again Azzouni (2009).\n\n\nThere are, however, another group of contemporary philosophers of\nmathematics whose views seem close to formalism, namely (some among\nthe) fictionalists. Now the term \u2018fictionalist\u2019 can\nmislead as not all fictionalists assimilate mathematics to fiction.\nAnd even if one did, the question would arise: \u2018What\nphilosophical account of fiction, and discourse about fiction, does\none adopt?\u2019 Many philosophers resile from a realist ontology of\nfictional characters just as many reject a\nrealist\u2014platonistic\u2014ontology for mathematics. A very\nsimplistic anti-realism about fictionalism might analyse such\nstatements as \u2018Oliver Twist was born in London\u2019 as true\n(or correct) just in case that sentence, or a synonym, occurs in\nDickens\u2019s novel (Field, 1989: 3). Even if this worked for\nfiction, which it pretty clearly does\n not,[5]\n a parallel approach for mathematics is patently absurd. If a\nmathematical thesis is proclaimed a theorem, with or without proof, in\na journal, be it however respectable then, even if this claim is never\nchallenged and the assertion accepted by the mathematical community\nthis by no means entails that the thesis is true (or correct, if one\ndislikes applying truth predicates to mathematical sentences). Given\nthe number of \u201ctheorems\u201d whose purported proofs were later\ndiscovered to be incorrect, we can be pretty sure some falsehoods will\nwrongly remain accepted for all time as proven. Moreover there will be\nno end of mathematical claims, some true, some false, which never make\nit into the mathematical literature at all, never being considered by\nactual mathematicians.\n\nNow the Oliver Twist example is owing to Hartry Field, the founder of\nthe school of fictionalism, if we may term it such. But he qualifies\nhis position as follows:\n\nmost of us believe that Oliver Twist lived in London only in the sense\nthat we believe that the novel says that or has as a\nconsequence that Oliver Twist lived in London (1989, 3) [emphasis\nmine].\n\n\nWhether or not this will work for fiction (What if the work is\ninconsistent: must one use a relevant consequence relation? How can it\nhandle comparisons among different works as in the Tolstoy/Dostoyevsky\nexample above?) this is an interesting position on mathematics with\ndefinite formalistic overtones. The mathematician can put forward any\n(consistent) theory she likes. The truths of the theory are then just\nthe consequences of the theory, there is no need to think that the\ntheory represents an external reality. Fictionalism along these lines\nhas been investigated by Mary Leng (2010). But a key question is: how\ndoes one read \u2018consequence\u2019? For a formalist, this has to\nbe consequence as derivability. But Leng rejects such a reading: her\nfictionalism is one in which logical consequence is interpreted not\nsyntactically but modally, with the necessity in question taken as\nprimitive. Hence, this subspecies of fictionalism cannot be classed as\nformalist.\n\nWeir, by contrast, explicitly embraces formalism (1991; 1993; 2010;\n2016), moreover formalism in the game formalism tradition. His\nposition, if situated with respect to fictionalism, can be seen as one\nin which \u2018consequence\u2019 is read, in the formalist\ntradition, syntactically, in terms of formal derivability. As a first\napproximation, the position is that a mathematical sentence is true if\nthere exists a concrete derivation of a token of it, false if\nthere exists a concrete derivation of a token of its negation. Since\ntruth and falsity conditions make no appeal to abstract proofs, this\ntype of formalism is firmly anti-platonist. \n\nThis bluntly concretist formalism would seem to face insuperable\nproblems: for example in the shape of the \u2018concretely\nundecidable\u2019, those short theses with unfeasibly long proofs or\ndisproofs mentioned above in connection with Goodman and Quine\u2019s\nnominalism. Weir\u2019s attempt to address such problems takes as its\nbasis a fairly common \u2018post-Fregean\u2019 or\n\u2018neo-Fregean\u2019 perspective on language. Frege, at least\nearly in his career, held that the truth value of a sentence is\ndetermined by two factors, the Sinn, the sense, literal meaning\nor informational content, of the sentence; and the way the world is.\nIndexicality and wider context relativity of sentences he initially\nsupposed could be met by assuming speakers who uttered and grasped\nsuch sentences took them as elliptical for more complete utterances\nwhose sense fixed, in combination with the world, a unique truth\nvalue.\n\nLater work (including Frege\u2019s own) revealed the inadequacy of\nthis picture, revealed that some indexicality, for instance, is\n\u2018essential\u2019 in John Perry\u2019s phrase, to the thought\nexpressed. I can utter \u2018it\u2019s hot now\u2019 truly without\nknowing where, when or even who (if sufficiently disoriented or out my\nhead) I am. Those who are not utterly sceptical, as radical\ncontextualists are, of systematic theories of meaning, will amend\nFrege\u2019s view to a tripartite one. A sentence\u2019s truth\nvalue, in a particular context, is determined by its informational\ncontent, by contextual circumstances related to, \u2018fitted\nto\u2019, the utterance by aspects of the speakers\u2019 practice,\nand finally by the mind and language-independent world. The contextual\ncircumstances need not figure in the sense or informational content of\nthe utterance; thus a specification of them may include dates and\nlocations, though this is not part of the sense of \u2018it\u2019s\nhot now\u2019 (compare Kaplan\u2019s character versus\ncontent distinction, especially the second sense of\n\u2018content\u2019 discussed in his 1989 (fn 28: 503)). \n\nThis picture in turn suggests the idea that the contextual\ncircumstances which \u2018make true\u2019, in conjunction with\nindependent reality, an utterance, may make it true in a non-realist\nfashion. In Weir\u2019s version of game formalism, the fundamental\nidea is that what makes true (or false) \\(\\text{\u2018}\\sin^2\\theta\n+\\cos^2\\theta = 1\\text{\u2019}\\) in a particular system is the existence of\na concrete proof or refutation, though the statement that such a\nconcrete proof exists is no part of the literal meaning or sense of\nthe claim. \n\nThe advantage of this type of formalism is that it not only affirms\nthe meaningfulness, the possession of sense, of mathematical\nutterances; in sharp contrast with traditional game formalism, it\nholds that such utterances have truth values, where proofs or\nrefutations exist. The problem of the metatheory is met if one can\ngive, after the fashion of Goodman and Quine 1947, a non-mathematical\naccount of concrete proof. Of course, as noted above, severe problems\nremain. The problem of applicability has to be met, by providing\nconservative extension proofs for example. And of course the theory is\nthreatened not only by G\u00f6del\u2014type incompleteness and the\nundecidable\u2014but intuitively truth-valued\u2013 sentences it\nthrows up; even more devastating indeterminacy looms in the form of\n\u2018concretely undecidable\u2019 sentences such as Tennant\u2019s\nprimality claim of section 5. \n\nOne strategy for dealing with these problems is to combine formalism\nwith strict finitism (for one brand of which see Yessinin-Volpin\n(1961; 1970) and for criticism Dummett (1975): only feasibly long\n\u201cdigestible\u201d tokens\u2014of formulae and of proofs\u2014exist.\nFormulae with no feasible proofs or disproofs simply lack truth value.\nSince we know from G\u00f6delian speed-up considerations that for many a\nprovable sentence the shortest derivations of it or its negation are\nvastly longer than the sentence itself, this finitist/formalism\nposition threatens to cause havoc across large areas of perfectly\nordinary mathematics. \n\nWeir argues (2010; 2016) that finitist formalism is not only extremely\nradical, it is incoherent. The reason is the all-pervasive role of\nabbreviation which generates complex tokens where most of their\nsubparts will never exist, for example abbreviations which create\nnumerals naming (speaking with the platonist) arbitrarily high\nnumbers. As a result, strict finitist specifications cannot be given\nin the usual inductive fashion, as the intersection of all inductive\nsets containing the base set and closed under the complexity-forming\noperations. And this in turn means we cannot prove even very simple\nfacts about wffs and proof.\n\nIdealisation, then, is essential in metamathematics, including the\nidealised notions of truth and proof found in metamathematics. If the\nformalist is entitled to assert there are infinitely many primes,\nwhilst denying abstract objects exist, there seems no reason why she\ncannot affirm that there are infinitely many formulae or infinitely\nmany proofs, whilst also denying that abstract objects exist. Weir\n(2016: 38\u201339) therefore argues that the formalist can answer the\nproblem of concrete undecidables so long as there are concrete\nproofs (or proof sketches) of results to the effect that formal truth,\nfor a given language or sub-language, coincides with formal\nprovability, and that there is no reason to restrict idealisation for\nfinitary languages. \n\nIn conclusion, the formalist who espouses the meaningfulness and\nindeed truth of standard mathematical theories, including proof theory\nfor example, has more resources to meet such claims than classic game\nformalism. The question is whether these are enough to salvage a\nposition which it is fair to say most philosophers of mathematics\nstill think hopeless. There is, on the other hand, certainly no\nuniversal consensus that formalism is dead and buried and signs of\nstrong sympathy for formalism among some mathematicians and computer\nscientists. \n", "bibliography": {"categories": [], "cat_ref_text": {"ref_list": ["Awodey, Steve, 2014, \u2018Structuralism, Invariance, and\nUnivalence\u2019, <em>Philosophia Mathematica</em> (III), 22:\n135\u2013159.", "Azzouni, Jody, 2004, \u2018The Derivation-Indicator View of\nMathematical Practice\u2019, <em>Philosophia Mathematica</em>, (III)\n12: 81\u2013105.", "\u2013\u2013\u2013, 2005, \u2018How to Nominalize\nFormalism\u2019, <em>Philosophia Mathematica</em> (III), 13:\n135\u2013159.", "\u2013\u2013\u2013, 2006, <em>Tracking Reason: Proof,\nConsequence and Truth</em>, Oxford: Oxford University Press\n(especially Chapter 7).", "\u2013\u2013\u2013, 2009, \u2018Why do Informal Proofs Conform\nto Formal Norms\u2019, <em>Foundations of Science</em>, 14:\n9\u201326.", "Barendregt, H.P., 1984, <em>The Lambda Calculus</em>, Amsterdam:\nNorth Holland.", "Boolos, George, 1987, \u2018A Curious Inference\u2019,\n<em>Journal of Philosophical Logic</em>, 16: 1\u201312; reprinted in\nGeorge Boolos, <em>Logic, Logic and Logic</em> Cambridge, MA: Harvard\nUniversity Press, 1998, 376\u201382.", "Carnap, Rudolf, 1934 [1937], <em>Logische Syntax der Sprache</em>,\nVienna: Springer; translated by A.
