    "main_text": "Philosophical Issues of Secession\n1. Philosophical Issues of Secession\n\n\nPolitical scientists, sociologists, and political economists attempt\nto describe and explain the causes and effects of secessionist\nmovements and of states\u2019 reactions to them. Philosophers focus on\nthe moral issues and on clarifying the conceptual framework for\nthinking about secession. Philosophical work on secession can be\ndivided into three categories: (1) attempts to articulate the\nconditions under which a group has the moral right to secede; (2)\nexaminations of the compatibility or incompatibility of secession with\nconstitutionalism, (3) attempts to determine what position\ninternational law should take regarding secession. Thus far,\nphilosophical theories of secession have not been integrated with two\nareas of normative theorizing that are directly relevant to them. The\nfirst is just war theory. This is surprising, since part of what\nmotivates systematic thinking about secession is a realization that\nattempts to secede often involve or provoke large-scale violence. The\nsecond is theories of territorial justice. This, too, is surprising,\nbecause ideally a theory of secession would be situated within a\nbroader normative theory of a range of claims to territory, including,\nbut not limited to claims to sovereign jurisdiction of the sort now\nassociated with statehood.\n\n\nIt is useful to distinguish secession from other ways in which\n\u201cseparation\u201d or \u201cstate-breaking\u201d can occur. In\nwhat might be called secession in the classic sense, a group in a\nportion of the territory of a state attempt to create a new state\nthere; secessionists attempt to exit, leaving behind the original state\nin reduced form. Second, there is irredentist secession, wherein the\nattempt is not to create a new state, but to merge the seceding\nterritory with a neighboring state. This typically occurs when the\nmajority in the seceding area are of the same ethno-nationality as that\nwhich is predominant in the neighboring state. A third case,\nexemplified by the dissolution of Czechoslovakia, occurs when there is\nagreement between the populations or at least the leaders of two\nregions (which together comprise the whole territory of the state), to\nsplit the state into two new states. A fourth case is that of\nexternally imposed partition of an existing state into two or more new\nstates. In the past partition usually occurred when a deal was struck\nbetween two powerful neighboring states at the expense of the state\nthat was partitioned, as with the partitioning of Poland between Nazi\nGermany and the Soviet Union. At present, externally imposed partition\nis more likely to be considered as a last resort for dealing with\nintractable ethno-national conflict within a state. In what follows,\nthe focus is on secession in the classical sense, but with some\nattention also to irredentist secession.\n",
