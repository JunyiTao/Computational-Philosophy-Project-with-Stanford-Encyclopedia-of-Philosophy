    "main_text": "Defamiliarization of the Familiar\n3. Defamiliarization of the Familiar\n\nIf \u2018everyday\u2019 is characterized as the familiar, ordinary,\ncommonplace, and routine, regardless of the specific content that\nvaries from people to people depending upon their lifestyle,\noccupation, living environment, and other factors, what makes its\naesthetic appreciation possible? The following response dominates\neveryday aesthetics discourse: the aesthetic appreciation of everyday\nlife requires defamiliarization, making strange, or casting an aura.\nBecause we are most of the time preoccupied by the task at hand in our\ndaily life, practical considerations mask the aesthetic potential of\ncommonplace objects and ordinary activities. Furthermore, such\nexperiences lack any coherent structure consisting of unity, pervasive\ncharacter, and a clear beginning and an end. In short, according to\nDewey, our everyday humdrum proceeds mechanically without any internal\norganic evolution, hence \u201canesthetic.\u201d Only when we have\nan experience with all the structural requirements fulfilled\ndoes our everyday life gain aesthetic merit. Once we have an\nexperience with a different attitude and perceptual gear and/or a\ncohesive internal structure, we can unearth latent aesthetic values in\nthe most ordinary and routine. This view can be interpreted as a\nfaithful application of the claim made by the aesthetic attitude\ntheory that theoretically anything can be an object of aesthetic\nexperience. Mundane objects can acquire a kind of \u2018aura\u2019\nthat heightens their aesthetic value (Leonhardt 1985; Tuan 1993;\nVisser 1997; Gumbrecht 2006; Leddy 2008, 2012a; Al Qudowa 2017).\nAccording to this interpretation, what is new about everyday\naesthetics is its illumination of those aspects of our lives that are\nnormally neglected or ignored because they are eclipsed by standout\naesthetic experiences we often have with works of art and nature. More\ncareful attention and a different mindset can reveal a surprisingly\nrich aesthetic dimension of the otherwise mundane, non-memorable,\nordinary parts of our daily life. Many works of art are helpful in\nguiding us through the morasses of everyday life toward a rewarding\naesthetic experience (Dillard 1974; Prose 1999; Stabb 2002; Martin\n2004, Leddy 2012a; Nanay 2016, 2018). This trajectory of everyday\naesthetics is welcomed by a number of thinkers for its contribution to\nenriching life experiences, encouraging mindful living, and\nfacilitating happiness without problematic consequences that often\naccompany a hedonistic lifestyle (Irvin 2008b; Shusterman 2013;\nMelchionne 2014; Leddy 2014b).\n\nAt the same time, some point out the danger of over-emphasizing\ndefamiliarization as a precondition for everyday aesthetics. That is,\nthis way of accounting for everyday aesthetics risks losing the very\neveryday-ness of everyday experience, thereby becoming unable to\ncapture the aesthetic texture of everyday life characterized by its\nfamiliar, ordinary, and mundane quality (Felski 2002, 2009; Highmore\n2004, 2011a; Haapala 2005; Saito 2017a). The challenge then becomes\nhow to capture the very ordinary everyday-ness of everyday life while\nengaging aesthetically. That is, experiencing and appreciating the\nordinary as extraordinary follows a rather well-trodden path in\naesthetics discourse, while experiencing and appreciating the ordinary\nas ordinary poses a specific challenge to everyday aesthetics\ndiscourse.\n\nSeveral responses have been given to account for the aesthetics of the\nordinary as ordinary. One proposed response is to regard qualities\nsuch as the familiar and the ordinary as positively appreciable as a\ncounterpart to those qualities that make some experiences stand out\nfor being intense and extraordinary. Though not stunning or intense,\nthose qualities characterizing ordinary life provide a quiet calm,\ncomfort, stability, and security to our life experience (Haapala\n2005). It is difficult to imagine how we can handle, let alone enjoy,\na constant series of extraordinary, intense experiences with no\nrestful period. Many aspects of domestic life instead offer comfort,\nstability, and respite, in short hominess, because of the very\nordinary and repetitive nature, and such qualities are indispensable\nfor good life and appreciable in their own right (Highmore 2004,\n2011a; Irvin 2008b; Melchionne 2014).\n\nHowever, this response is challenged for failing to explain what is\ndistinctly aesthetic about the sense of comfort and stability. The\nvalue of these feelings, according to the critics, is rather\nexistentially-oriented and possibly relies on the instrumental role\nthey play in assuring a secure foundation for life. An alternative\nsolution to the dilemma proposed is to focus on the functional use of\nobjects of daily life that is not separate from our management and\nflow of daily life or the cultural context and knowledge required for\nits use. When an object functions particularly well, the pleasure we\ngain is still embedded in our daily life and does not render the\nexperience out of gear from the flow of everyday (Forsey 2014).\n\nThis move can also be characterized as a variation of\ncognitively-oriented aesthetics widely discussed in environmental\naesthetics regarding nature. Instead of natural sciences that inform\nthe aesthetic appreciation of nature, the suggestion is that everyday\naesthetic experience be informed by common sense knowledge about the\nobject\u2019s function, significance, and place in our lives that\nprovides the familiarity sought for in aesthetically experiencing the\nfamiliar as familiar (Carlson 2014).\n\nThese solutions address familiarity experienced as familiar as a\npositive value whether regarding hominess or excellent functionality.\nHowever, those who are concerned with developing the classificatory\nsense of aesthetics point out that the the lack of coherent structure,\nslackness, monotony, and humdrum that, according to Dewey, generate\nexperiences that are \u201canesthetic\u201d actually also\ncharacterize the aesthetic texture of everyday life (Highmore 2011a;\nMollar 2014; Saito 2017a). Deficiency in positive aesthetic qualities,\nsuch as exciting intensity, coherent narrative structure, or pervasive\nunifying theme, does not necessarily mean lack of aesthetic qualities.\nThose aspects of our lives can still be regarded as permeated by\naesthetic qualities, though negative, such as dreariness and painful\nmonotony. Such negative characterization of everyday life has often\nbeen the subject of Marxist interpretations of workers\u2019 daily\nlives, whether at work or at home, providing a platform for rebellious\nmovements, such as the Situationist International (Highmore 2010).\n",
