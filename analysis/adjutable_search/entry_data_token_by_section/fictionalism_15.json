    "main_text": "Arguments against Fictionalism || The fictionalist\u2019s preferred analogies\n4.4 The fictionalist\u2019s preferred analogies\n\nAs noted above, one way that fictionalists try to argue for their\ndoctrines is by appeal to cases where, supposedly, fictionalist theses\nare obviously true. Two such cases are motion discourse, and talk\nabout \u2018the average F\u2019. However, in both of these\ncases, it can plausibly be argued that proper attention to the\nsemantics undercuts the fictionalist\u2019s claim.\n\nFirst, critics such as Stanley (2001) stress that while terms of the\nform \u2018the average F\u2019 superficially seem like\nsingular terms, they do not behave semantically like ordinary singular\nterms. But if they do not behave semantically like ordinary singular\nterms there is no call for a fictionalist account explaining why we do\nnot commit ourselves to there being entities such as the average F\nwhen assertively uttering sentences of the form \u201cthe average\nF is G\u201d (see also Kennedy and Stanley 2009).\n\nTurn next to motion discourse. Brendan Jackson (2007) argues that any\ntemptation to be a fictionalist about motion discourse stems from an\noversimplified conception of the semantics of the relevant sentences.\nCompare\n\n\n(1) Europe is small.\n\n(2) That cell phone is a bit heavy.\n\n(3) The remote is to the left of the television.\n\n(4) A lion is hiding behind the bush.\n\n\nJackson notes two things. First, these cases are \u201canalogous to\nwhat is going on when we utter typical motion ascriptions. We can\ndescribe all these utterances as incomplete, in the sense\nthat there is some parameter \u2014 a comparison class, a purpose, a\nperspective or a frame of reference \u2014 that must be taken into\naccount if the utterance is to be regarded as expressing a possibly\ntrue proposition, and yet the utterance contains no explicit word or\nphrase that specifies a value for this parameter\u201d. And second,\nsemanticists typically agree on what is going on in (1)\u2013(4): the\nsentences are simply context-sensitive. There is no need for\na fictionalist proposal to explain why in typical utterances of them\nwe express something true. According to Jackson, the same story can be\ntold in the case of motion ascriptions.\n\nThe points concerning motion discourse and \u2018the average\nF\u2019 in the first instance cast doubt only on some\nspecific examples that fictionalists tend to use to motivate their\nfictionalist theses. But they also suggest a more general lesson:\nfictionalist theses can often be undercut by closer attention to the\nsemantics of the discourse in question. \n",
