    "main_text": "Women as a group || Gender nominalism\n4.1 Gender nominalism\n4.1.1 Gendered social series\n\nIris Young argues that unless there is \u201csome sense in which\n\u2018woman\u2019 is the name of a social collective [that feminism\nrepresents], there is nothing specific to feminist politics\u201d\n(1997, 13). In order to make the category women intelligible,\nshe argues that women make up a series: a particular kind of social\ncollective \u201cwhose members are unified passively by the objects\ntheir actions are oriented around and/or by the objectified results of\nthe material effects of the actions of the other\u201d (Young 1997,\n23). A series is distinct from a group in that, whereas members of\ngroups are thought to self-consciously share certain goals, projects,\ntraits and/ or self-conceptions, members of series pursue their own\nindividual ends without necessarily having anything at all in common.\nYoung holds that women are not bound together by a shared feature or\nexperience (or set of features and experiences) since she takes\nSpelman\u2019s particularity argument to have established definitely\nthat no such feature exists (1997, 13; see also: Frye 1996; Heyes\n2000). Instead, women\u2019s category is unified by certain\npractico-inert realities or the ways in which women\u2019s lives and\ntheir actions are oriented around certain objects and everyday\nrealities (Young 1997, 23\u20134). For example, bus commuters make up\na series unified through their individual actions being organised\naround the same practico-inert objects of the bus and the practice of\npublic transport. Women make up a series unified through women\u2019s\nlives and actions being organised around certain practico-inert\nobjects and realities that position them as women.\n\nYoung identifies two broad groups of such practico-inert objects and\nrealities. First, phenomena associated with female bodies (physical\nfacts), biological processes that take place in female bodies\n(menstruation, pregnancy, childbirth) and social rules associated with\nthese biological processes (social rules of menstruation, for\ninstance). Second, gender-coded objects and practices: pronouns,\nverbal and visual representations of gender, gender-coded artefacts\nand social spaces, clothes, cosmetics, tools and furniture. So, women\nmake up a series since their lives and actions are organised around\nfemale bodies and certain gender-coded objects. Their series is bound\ntogether passively and the unity is \u201cnot one that arises from\nthe individuals called women\u201d (Young 1997, 32).\n\nAlthough Young\u2019s proposal purports to be a response to\nSpelman\u2019s worries, Stone has questioned whether it is, after\nall, susceptible to the particularity argument: ultimately, on\nYoung\u2019s view, something women as women share (their\npractico-inert realities) binds them together (Stone 2004).\n4.1.2 Resemblance nominalism\n\nNatalie Stoljar holds that unless the category of women is unified,\nfeminist action on behalf of women cannot be justified (1995, 282).\nStoljar too is persuaded by the thought that women qua women\ndo not share anything unitary. This prompts her to argue for\nresemblance nominalism. This is the view that a certain kind of\nresemblance relation holds between entities of a particular type (for\nmore on resemblance nominalism, see Armstrong 1989, 39\u201358).\nStoljar is not alone in arguing for resemblance relations to make\nsense of women as a category; others have also done so, usually\nappealing to Wittgenstein\u2019s \u2018family resemblance\u2019\nrelations (Alcoff 1988; Green & Radford Curry 1991; Heyes 2000;\nMunro 2006). Stoljar relies more on Price\u2019s resemblance\nnominalism whereby x is a member of some type F only\nif x resembles some paradigm or exemplar of F\nsufficiently closely (Price 1953, 20). For instance, the type of red\nentities is unified by some chosen red paradigms so that only those\nentities that sufficiently resemble the paradigms count as red. The\ntype (or category) of women, then, is unified by some chosen woman\nparadigms so that those who sufficiently resemble the woman paradigms\ncount as women (Stoljar 1995, 284).\n\nSemantic considerations about the concept woman suggest to\nStoljar that resemblance nominalism should be endorsed (Stoljar 2000,\n28). It seems unlikely that the concept is applied on the basis of\nsome single social feature all and only women possess. By contrast,\nwoman is a cluster concept and our attributions of womanhood\npick out \u201cdifferent arrangements of features in different\nindividuals\u201d (Stoljar 2000, 27). More specifically, they pick\nout the following clusters of features: (a) Female sex; (b)\nPhenomenological features: menstruation, female sexual experience,\nchild-birth, breast-feeding, fear of walking on the streets at night\nor fear of rape; (c) Certain roles: wearing typically female clothing,\nbeing oppressed on the basis of one\u2019s sex or undertaking\ncare-work; (d) Gender attribution: \u201ccalling oneself a woman,\nbeing called a woman\u201d (Stoljar 1995, 283\u20134). For Stoljar,\nattributions of womanhood are to do with a variety of traits and\nexperiences: those that feminists have historically termed\n\u2018gender traits\u2019 (like social, behavioural, psychological\ntraits) and those termed \u2018sex traits\u2019.\nNonetheless, she holds that since the concept woman applies\nto (at least some) trans persons, one can be a woman without being\nfemale (Stoljar 1995, 282).\n\nThe cluster concept woman does not, however,\nstraightforwardly provide the criterion for picking out the category\nof women. Rather, the four clusters of features that the concept picks\nout help single out woman paradigms that in turn help single out the\ncategory of women. First, any individual who possesses a\nfeature from at least three of the four clusters mentioned\nwill count as an exemplar of the category. For instance, an\nAfrican-American with primary and secondary female sex\ncharacteristics, who describes herself as a woman and is oppressed on\nthe basis of her sex, along with a white European hermaphrodite\nbrought up \u2018as a girl\u2019, who engages in female roles and\nhas female phenomenological features despite lacking female sex\ncharacteristics, will count as woman paradigms (Stoljar 1995,\n 284).[7]\n Second, any individual who resembles \u201cany of the paradigms\nsufficiently closely (on Price\u2019s account, as closely as [the\nparadigms] resemble each other) will be a member of the resemblance\nclass \u2018woman\u2019\u201d (Stoljar 1995, 284). That is, what\ndelimits membership in the category of women is that one resembles\nsufficiently a woman paradigm.\n\n4.2 Neo-gender realism\n4.2.1 Social subordination and gender\n\nIn a series of articles collected in her 2012 book, Sally Haslanger\nargues for a way to define the concept woman that is\npolitically useful, serving as a tool in feminist fights against\nsexism, and that shows woman to be a social (not a\nbiological) notion. More specifically, Haslanger argues that gender is\na matter of occupying either a subordinate or a privileged social\nposition. In some articles, Haslanger is arguing for a revisionary\nanalysis of the concept woman (2000b; 2003a; 2003b).\nElsewhere she suggests that her analysis may not be that revisionary\nafter all (2005; 2006). Consider the former argument first.\nHaslanger\u2019s analysis is, in her terms, ameliorative: it aims to\nelucidate which gender concepts best help feminists achieve their\nlegitimate purposes thereby elucidating those concepts feminists\nshould be using (Haslanger 2000b,\n 33).[8]\n Now, feminists need gender terminology in order to fight sexist\ninjustices (Haslanger 2000b, 36). In particular, they need gender\nterms to identify, explain and talk about persistent social\ninequalities between males and females. Haslanger\u2019s analysis of\ngender begins with the recognition that females and males differ in\ntwo respects: physically and in their social positions. Societies in\ngeneral tend to \u201cprivilege individuals with male bodies\u201d\n(Haslanger 2000b, 38) so that the social positions they subsequently\noccupy are better than the social positions of those with female\nbodies. And this generates persistent sexist injustices. With this in\nmind, Haslanger specifies how she understands genders:\n\nS is a woman iff [by definition] S is\nsystematically subordinated along some dimension (economic, political,\nlegal, social, etc.), and S is \u2018marked\u2019 as a\ntarget for this treatment by observed or imagined bodily features\npresumed to be evidence of a female\u2019s biological role in\nreproduction.\n\n\nS is a man iff [by definition] S is\nsystematically privileged along some dimension (economic, political,\nlegal, social, etc.), and S is \u2018marked\u2019 as a\ntarget for this treatment by observed or imagined bodily features\npresumed to be evidence of a male\u2019s biological role in\nreproduction. (2003a, 6\u20137)\n\n\nThese are constitutive of being a woman and a man:\nwhat makes calling S a woman apt, is that S is\noppressed on sex-marked grounds; what makes calling S a man\napt, is that S is privileged on sex-marked grounds.\n\nHaslanger\u2019s ameliorative analysis is counterintuitive in that\nfemales who are not sex-marked for oppression, do not count as women.\nAt least arguably, the Queen of England is not oppressed on sex-marked\ngrounds and so, would not count as a woman on Haslanger\u2019s\ndefinition. And, similarly, all males who are not privileged would not\ncount as men. This might suggest that Haslanger\u2019s analysis\nshould be rejected in that it does not capture what language users\nhave in mind when applying gender terms. However, Haslanger argues\nthat this is not a reason to reject the definitions, which she takes\nto be revisionary: they are not meant to capture our intuitive gender\nterms. In response, Mikkola (2009) has argued that revisionary\nanalyses of gender concepts, like Haslanger\u2019s, are both\npolitically unhelpful and philosophically unnecessary.\n\nNote also that Haslanger\u2019s proposal is eliminativist: gender\njustice would eradicate gender, since it would abolish those sexist\nsocial structures responsible for sex-marked oppression and privilege.\nIf sexist oppression were to cease, women and men would no longer\nexist (although there would still be males and females). Not all\nfeminists endorse such an eliminativist view though. Stone holds that\nHaslanger does not leave any room for positively revaluing what it is\nto be a woman: since Haslanger defines woman in terms of\nsubordination,\n\nany woman who challenges her subordinate status must by definition be\nchallenging her status as a woman, even if she does not intend to\n\u2026 positive change to our gender norms would involve getting rid\nof the (necessarily subordinate) feminine gender. (Stone 2007, 160)\n\n\nBut according to Stone this is not only undesirable \u2013 one should\nbe able to challenge subordination without having to challenge\none\u2019s status as a woman. It is also false: \u201cbecause norms\nof femininity can be and constantly are being revised, women can be\nwomen without thereby being subordinate\u201d (Stone 2007, 162;\nMikkola [2016] too argues that Haslanger\u2019s eliminativism is\ntroublesome).\n\nTheodore Bach holds that Haslanger\u2019s eliminativism is\nundesirable on other grounds, and that Haslanger\u2019s position\nfaces another more serious problem. Feminism faces the following\nworries (among others):\n\n\nRepresentation problem: \u201cif there is no real group of\n\u2018women\u2019, then it is incoherent to make moral claims and\nadvance political policies on behalf of women\u201d (Bach 2012,\n234).\n\nCommonality problems: (1) There is no feature that all women\ncross-culturally and transhistorically share. (2) Delimiting\nwomen\u2019s social kind with the help of some essential property\nprivileges those who possess it, and marginalizes those who do not\n(Bach 2012, 235).\n\n\nAccording to Bach, Haslanger\u2019s strategy to resolve these\nproblems appeals to \u2018social objectivism\u2019. First, we define\nwomen \u201caccording to a suitably abstract relational\nproperty\u201d (Bach 2012, 236), which avoids the commonality\nproblems. Second, Haslanger employs \u201can ontologically thin\nnotion of \u2018objectivity\u2019\u201d (Bach 2012, 236) that\nanswers the representation problem. Haslanger\u2019s solution (Bach\nholds) is specifically to argue that women make up an objective type\nbecause women are objectively similar to one another, and not simply\nclassified together given our background conceptual schemes. Bach\nclaims though that Haslanger\u2019s account is not objective enough,\nand we should on political grounds \u201cprovide a stronger\nontological characterization of the genders men and\nwomen according to which they are natural kinds with\nexplanatory essences\u201d (Bach 2012, 238). He thus proposes that\nwomen make up a natural kind with a historical essence:\n\nThe essential property of women, in virtue of which an individual is a\nmember of the kind \u2018women,\u2019 is participation in a lineage\nof women. In order to exemplify this relational property, an\nindividual must be a reproduction of ancestral women, in which case\nshe must have undergone the ontogenetic processes through which a\nhistorical gender system replicates women. (Bach 2012, 271)\n\n\nIn short, one is not a woman due to shared surface properties with\nother women (like occupying a subordinate social position). Rather,\none is a woman because one has the right history: one has undergone\nthe ubiquitous ontogenetic process of gender socialization. Thinking\nabout gender in this way supposedly provides a stronger kind unity\nthan Haslanger\u2019s that simply appeals to shared surface\nproperties.\n\nNot everyone agrees; Mikkola (2020) argues that Bach\u2019s\nmetaphysical picture has internal tensions that render it puzzling and\nthat Bach\u2019s metaphysics does not provide good responses to the\ncommonality and presentation problems. The historically essentialist\nview also has anti-trans implications. After all, trans women who have\nnot undergone female gender socialization won\u2019t count as women\non his view (Mikkola [2016, 2020] develops this line of critique in\nmore detail). More worryingly, trans women will count as men contrary\nto their self-identification. Both Bettcher (2013) and Jenkins (2016)\nconsider the importance of gender self-identification. Bettcher argues\nthat there is more than one \u2018correct\u2019 way to understand\nwomanhood: at the very least, the dominant (mainstream), and the\nresistant (trans) conceptions. Dominant views like that of\nBach\u2019s tend to erase trans people\u2019s experiences and to\nmarginalize trans women within feminist movements. Rather than trans\nwomen having to defend their self-identifying claims, these claims\nshould be taken at face value right from the start. And so, Bettcher\nholds, \u201cin analyzing the meaning of terms such as\n\u2018woman,\u2019 it is inappropriate to dismiss alternative ways\nin which those terms are actually used in trans subcultures; such\nusage needs to be taken into consideration as part of the\nanalysis\u201d (2013, 235).\n\nSpecifically with Haslanger in mind and in a similar vein, Jenkins\n(2016) discusses how Haslanger\u2019s revisionary approach unduly\nexcludes some trans women from women\u2019s social kind. On\nJenkins\u2019s view, Haslanger\u2019s ameliorative methodology in\nfact yields more than one satisfying target concept: one that\n\u201ccorresponds to Haslanger\u2019s proposed concept and captures\nthe sense of gender as an imposed social class\u201d; another that\n\u201ccaptures the sense of gender as a lived identity\u201d\n(Jenkins 2016, 397). The latter of these allows us to include trans\nwomen into women\u2019s social kind, who on Haslanger\u2019s social\nclass approach to gender would inappropriately have been excluded.\n(See Andler 2017 for the view that Jenkins\u2019s purportedly\ninclusive conception of gender is still not fully inclusive. Jenkins\n2018 responds to this charge and develops the notion of gender\nidentity still further.)\n\nIn addition to her revisionary argument, Haslanger has suggested that\nher ameliorative analysis of woman may not be as revisionary\nas it first seems (2005, 2006). Although successful in their reference\nfixing, ordinary language users do not always know precisely what they\nare talking about. Our language use may be skewed by oppressive\nideologies that can \u201cmislead us about the content of our own\nthoughts\u201d (Haslanger 2005, 12). Although her gender terminology\nis not intuitive, this could simply be because oppressive ideologies\nmislead us about the meanings of our gender terms. Our everyday gender\nterminology might mean something utterly different from what we\nthink it means; and we could be entirely ignorant of this.\nPerhaps Haslanger\u2019s analysis, then, has captured our everyday\ngender vocabulary revealing to us the terms that we actually employ:\nwe may be applying \u2018woman\u2019 in our everyday language on the\nbasis of sex-marked subordination whether we take ourselves to be\ndoing so or not. If this is so, Haslanger\u2019s gender terminology\nis not radically revisionist.\n\nSaul (2006) argues that, despite it being possible that we unknowingly\napply \u2018woman\u2019 on the basis of social subordination, it is\nextremely difficult to show that this is the case. This would require\nshowing that the gender terminology we in fact employ is\nHaslanger\u2019s proposed gender terminology. But discovering the\ngrounds on which we apply everyday gender terms is extremely difficult\nprecisely because they are applied in various and idiosyncratic ways\n(Saul 2006, 129). Haslanger, then, needs to do more in order to show\nthat her analysis is non-revisionary.\n4.2.2 Gender uniessentialism\n\nCharlotte Witt (2011a; 2011b) argues for a particular sort of gender\nessentialism, which Witt terms \u2018uniessentialism\u2019. Her\nmotivation and starting point is the following: many ordinary social\nagents report gender being essential to them and claim that they would\nbe a different person were they of a different sex/gender.\nUniessentialism attempts to understand and articulate this. However,\nWitt\u2019s work departs in important respects from the earlier\n(so-called) essentialist or gender realist positions discussed in\nSection 2: Witt does not posit some essential property of womanhood of\nthe kind discussed above, which failed to take women\u2019s\ndifferences into account. Further, uniessentialism differs\nsignificantly from those position developed in response to the problem\nof how we should conceive of women\u2019s social kind. It is not\nabout solving the standard dispute between gender nominalists and\ngender realists, or about articulating some supposedly shared property\nthat binds women together and provides a theoretical ground for\nfeminist political solidarity. Rather, uniessentialism aims to make\ngood the widely held belief that gender is constitutive of who we\n are.[9]\n\nUniessentialism is a sort of individual essentialism. Traditionally\nphilosophers distinguish between kind and individual essentialisms:\nthe former examines what binds members of a kind together and what do\nall members of some kind have in common qua members of that\nkind. The latter asks: what makes an individual the\nindividual it is. We can further distinguish two sorts of individual\nessentialisms: Kripkean identity essentialism and Aristotelian\nuniessentialism. The former asks: what makes an individual\nthat individual? The latter, however, asks a slightly\ndifferent question: what explains the unity of individuals? What\nexplains that an individual entity exists over and above the sum total\nof its constituent parts? (The standard feminist debate over gender\nnominalism and gender realism has largely been about kind\nessentialism. Being about individual essentialism, Witt\u2019s\nuniessentialism departs in an important way from the standard debate.)\nFrom the two individual essentialisms, Witt endorses the Aristotelian\none. On this view, certain functional essences have a unifying role:\nthese essences are responsible for the fact that material parts\nconstitute a new individual, rather than just a lump of stuff or a\ncollection of particles. Witt\u2019s example is of a house: the\nessential house-functional property (what the entity is for, what its\npurpose is) unifies the different material parts of a house so that\nthere is a house, and not just a collection of house-constituting\nparticles (2011a, 6). Gender (being a woman/a man) functions in a\nsimilar fashion and provides \u201cthe principle of normative\nunity\u201d that organizes, unifies and determines the roles of\nsocial individuals (Witt 2011a, 73). Due to this, gender is a\nuniessential property of social individuals.\n\nIt is important to clarify the notions of gender and\nsocial individuality that Witt employs. First, gender is a\nsocial position that \u201ccluster[s] around the engendering function\n\u2026 women conceive and bear \u2026 men beget\u201d (Witt\n2011a, 40). These are women and men\u2019s socially mediated\nreproductive functions (Witt 2011a, 29) and they differ from the\nbiological function of reproduction, which roughly corresponds to sex\non the standard sex/gender distinction. Witt writes: \u201cto be a\nwoman is to be recognized to have a particular function in\nengendering, to be a man is to be recognized to have a different\nfunction in engendering\u201d (2011a, 39). Second, Witt distinguishes\npersons (those who possess self-consciousness), human\nbeings (those who are biologically human) and social\nindividuals (those who occupy social positions synchronically and\ndiachronically). These ontological categories are not equivalent in\nthat they possess different persistence and identity conditions.\nSocial individuals are bound by social normativity, human beings by\nbiological normativity. These normativities differ in two respects:\nfirst, social norms differ from one culture to the next whereas\nbiological norms do not; second, unlike biological normativity, social\nnormativity requires \u201cthe recognition by others that an agent is\nboth responsive to and evaluable under a social norm\u201d (Witt\n2011a, 19). Thus, being a social individual is not equivalent to being\na human being. Further, Witt takes personhood to be defined in terms\nof intrinsic psychological states of self-awareness and\nself-consciousness. However, social individuality is defined in terms\nof the extrinsic feature of occupying a social position, which depends\nfor its existence on a social world. So, the two are not equivalent:\npersonhood is essentially about intrinsic features and could exist\nwithout a social world, whereas social individuality is essentially\nabout extrinsic features that could not exist without a social\nworld.\n\nWitt\u2019s gender essentialist argument crucially pertains to\nsocial individuals, not to persons or human beings: saying\nthat persons or human beings are gendered would be a category mistake.\nBut why is gender essential to social individuals? For Witt, social\nindividuals are those who occupy positions in social reality. Further,\n\u201csocial positions have norms or social roles associated with\nthem; a social role is what an individual who occupies a given social\nposition is responsive to and evaluable under\u201d (Witt 2011a, 59).\nHowever, qua social individuals, we occupy multiple social\npositions at once and over time: we can be women, mothers, immigrants,\nsisters, academics, wives, community organisers and team-sport coaches\nsynchronically and diachronically. Now, the issue for Witt is what\nunifies these positions so that a social individual is\nconstituted. After all, a bundle of social position occupancies does\nnot make for an individual (just as a bundle of properties like\nbeing white, cube-shaped and sweet do not\nmake for a sugar cube). For Witt, this unifying role is undertaken by\ngender (being a woman or a man): it is\n\na pervasive and fundamental social position that unifies and\ndetermines all other social positions both synchronically and\ndiachronically. It unifies them not physically, but by providing a\nprinciple of normative unity. (2011a, 19\u201320)\n\n\nBy \u2018normative unity\u2019, Witt means the following: given our\nsocial roles and social position occupancies, we are responsive to\nvarious sets of social norms. These norms are \u201ccomplex patterns\nof behaviour and practices that constitute what one ought to do in a\nsituation given one\u2019s social position(s) and one\u2019s social\ncontext\u201d (Witt 2011a, 82). The sets of norms can conflict: the\nnorms of motherhood can (and do) conflict with the norms of being an\nacademic philosopher. However, in order for this conflict to exist,\nthe norms must be binding on a single social individual.\nWitt, then, asks: what explains the existence and unity of the social\nindividual who is subject to conflicting social norms? The answer is\ngender.\n\nGender is not just a social role that unifies social individuals. Witt\ntakes it to be the social role \u2014 as she puts it, it is\nthe mega social role that unifies social agents. First,\ngender is a mega social role if it satisfies two conditions (and Witt\nclaims that it does): (1) if it provides the principle of synchronic\nand diachronic unity of social individuals, and (2) if it inflects and\ndefines a broad range of other social roles. Gender satisfies the\nfirst in usually being a life-long social position: a social\nindividual persists just as long as their gendered social position\npersists. Further, Witt maintains, trans people are not\ncounterexamples to this claim: transitioning entails that the old\nsocial individual has ceased to exist and a new one has come into\nbeing. And this is consistent with the same person persisting and\nundergoing social individual change via transitioning. Gender\nsatisfies the second condition too. It inflects other social roles,\nlike being a parent or a professional. The expectations attached to\nthese social roles differ depending on the agent\u2019s gender, since\ngender imposes different social norms to govern the execution of the\nfurther social roles. Now, gender \u2014 as opposed to some other\nsocial category, like race \u2014 is not just a mega social role; it\nis the unifying mega social role. Cross-cultural and trans-historical\nconsiderations support this view. Witt claims that patriarchy is a\nsocial universal (2011a, 98). By contrast, racial categorisation\nvaries historically and cross-culturally, and racial oppression is not\na universal feature of human cultures. Thus, gender has a better claim\nto being the social role that is uniessential to social individuals.\nThis account of gender essentialism not only explains social\nagents\u2019 connectedness to their gender, but it also provides a\nhelpful way to conceive of women\u2019s agency \u2014 something that\nis central to feminist politics.\n4.2.3 Gender as positionality\n\nLinda Alcoff holds that feminism faces an identity crisis: the\ncategory of women is feminism\u2019s starting point, but various\ncritiques about gender have fragmented the category and it is not\nclear how feminists should understand what it is to be a woman (2006,\nchapter 5). In response, Alcoff develops an account of gender as\npositionality whereby \u201cgender is, among other things, a\nposition one occupies and from which one can act politically\u201d\n(2006, 148). In particular, she takes one\u2019s social position to\nfoster the development of specifically gendered identities (or\nself-conceptions): \u201cThe very subjectivity (or subjective\nexperience of being a woman) and the very identity of women are\nconstituted by women\u2019s position\u201d (Alcoff 2006, 148).\nAlcoff holds that there is an objective basis for distinguishing\nindividuals on the grounds of (actual or expected) reproductive\nroles:\n\nWomen and men are differentiated by virtue of their different\nrelationship of possibility to biological reproduction, with\nbiological reproduction referring to conceiving, giving birth, and\nbreast-feeding, involving one\u2019s body. (Alcoff 2006, 172,\nitalics in original)\n\n\nThe thought is that those standardly classified as biologically\nfemale, although they may not actually be able to reproduce, will\nencounter \u201ca different set of practices, expectations, and\nfeelings in regard to reproduction\u201d than those standardly\nclassified as male (Alcoff 2006, 172). Further, this differential\nrelation to the possibility of reproduction is used as the basis for\nmany cultural and social phenomena that position women and men: it can\nbe\n\nthe basis of a variety of social segregations, it can engender the\ndevelopment of differential forms of embodiment experienced throughout\nlife, and it can generate a wide variety of affective responses, from\npride, delight, shame, guilt, regret, or great relief from having\nsuccessfully avoided reproduction. (Alcoff 2006, 172)\n\n\nReproduction, then, is an objective basis for distinguishing\nindividuals that takes on a cultural dimension in that it positions\nwomen and men differently: depending on the kind of body one has,\none\u2019s lived experience will differ. And this fosters the\nconstruction of gendered social identities: one\u2019s role in\nreproduction helps configure how one is socially positioned and this\nconditions the development of specifically gendered social\nidentities.\n\nSince women are socially positioned in various different contexts,\n\u201cthere is no gender essence all women share\u201d (Alcoff 2006,\n147\u20138). Nonetheless, Alcoff acknowledges that her account is\nakin to the original 1960s sex/gender distinction insofar as sex\ndifference (understood in terms of the objective division of\nreproductive labour) provides the foundation for certain cultural\narrangements (the development of a gendered social identity). But,\nwith the benefit of hindsight\n\nwe can see that maintaining a distinction between the objective\ncategory of sexed identity and the varied and culturally contingent\npractices of gender does not presume an absolute distinction of the\nold-fashioned sort between culture and a reified nature. (Alcoff 2006,\n175)\n\n\nThat is, her view avoids the implausible claim that sex is exclusively\nto do with nature and gender with culture. Rather, the distinction on\nthe basis of reproductive possibilities shapes and is shaped by the\nsorts of cultural and social phenomena (like varieties of social\nsegregation) these possibilities gives rise to. For instance,\ntechnological interventions can alter sex differences illustrating\nthat this is the case (Alcoff 2006, 175). Women\u2019s specifically\ngendered social identities that are constituted by their context\ndependent positions, then, provide the starting point for feminist\npolitics.\n5. Beyond the Binary\n\nRecently Robin Dembroff (2020) has argued that existing metaphysical\naccounts of gender fail to address non-binary gender identities. This\ngenerates two concerns. First, metaphysical accounts of gender (like\nthe ones outlined in previous sections) are insufficient for capturing\nthose who reject binary gender categorisation where people are either\nmen or women. In so doing, these accounts are not satisfying as\nexplanations of gender understood in a more expansive sense that goes\nbeyond the binary. Second, the failure to understand non-binary gender\nidentities contributes to a form of\n epistemic injustice\n called \u2018hermeneutical injustice\u2019: it feeds into a\ncollective failure to comprehend and analyse concepts and practices\nthat undergird non-binary classification schemes, thereby impeding on\none\u2019s ability to fully understand themselves. To overcome these\nproblems, Dembroff suggests an account of genderqueer that they call\n\u2018critical gender kind\u2019:\n\na kind whose members collectively destabilize one or more elements of\ndominant gender ideology. Genderqueer, on my proposed model, is a\ncategory whose members collectively destabilize the binary axis, or\nthe idea that the only possible genders are the exclusive and\nexhaustive kinds men and women. (2020, 2)\n\n\nNote that Dembroff\u2019s position is not to be confused with\n\u2018gender critical feminist\u2019 positions like those noted\nabove, which are critical of the prevalent feminist focus on gender,\nas opposed to sex, kinds. Dembroff understands genderqueer as a gender\nkind, but one that is critical of dominant binary understandings of\ngender.\n\nDembroff identifies two modes of destabilising the gender binary:\nprincipled and existential. Principled destabilising \u201cstems from\nor otherwise expresses individuals\u2019 social or political\ncommitments regarding gender norms, practices, and structures\u201d,\nwhile existential destabilising \u201cstems from or otherwise\nexpresses individuals\u2019 felt or desired gender roles, embodiment,\nand/or categorization\u201d (2020, 13). These modes are not mutually\nexclusive, and they can help us understand the difference between\nallies and members of genderqueer kinds: \u201cWhile both resist\ndominant gender ideology, members of [genderqueer] kinds resist (at\nleast in part) due to felt or desired gender categorization that\ndeviates from dominant expectations, norms, and assumptions\u201d\n(2020, 14). These modes of destabilisation also enable us to formulate\nan understanding of non-critical gender kinds that binary\nunderstandings of women and men\u2019s kinds exemplify. Dembroff\ndefines these kinds as follows:\n\nFor a given kind X, X is a non-critical gender\nkind relative to a given society iff X\u2019s members\ncollectively restabilize one or more elements of the dominant gender\nideology in that society. (2020, 14)\n\n\nDembroff\u2019s understanding of critical and non-critical gender\nkinds importantly makes gender kind membership something more and\nother than a mere psychological phenomenon. To engage in collectively\ndestabilising or restabilising dominant gender normativity and\nideology, we need more than mere attitudes or mental states \u2013\nresisting or maintaining such normativity requires action as well. In\nso doing, Dembroff puts their position forward as an alternative to\ntwo existing internalist positions about gender. First, to Jennifer\nMcKitrick\u2019s (2015) view whereby gender is dispositional: in a\ncontext where someone is disposed to behave in ways that would be\ntaken by others to be indicative of (e.g.) womanhood, the person has a\nwoman\u2019s gender identity. Second, to Jenkin\u2019s (2016, 2018)\nposition that takes an individual\u2019s gender identity to be\ndependent on which gender-specific norms the person experiences as\nbeing relevant to them. On this view, someone is a woman if the person\nexperiences norms associated with women to be relevant to the person\nin the particular social context that they are in. Neither of these\npositions well-captures non-binary identities, Dembroff argues, which\nmotivates the account of genderqueer identities as critical gender\nkinds.\n\nAs Dembroff acknowledges, substantive philosophical work on non-binary\ngender identities is still developing. However, it is important to\nnote that analytic philosophers are beginning to engage in gender\nmetaphysics that goes beyond the binary.\n6. Conclusion\n\nThis entry first looked at feminist objections to biological\ndeterminism and the claim that gender is socially constructed. Next,\nit examined feminist critiques of prevalent understandings of gender\nand sex, and the distinction itself. In response to these concerns,\nthe entry looked at how a unified women\u2019s category could be\narticulated for feminist political purposes. This illustrated that\ngender metaphysics \u2014 or what it is to be a woman or a\nman or a genderqueer person \u2014 is still very much a live issue.\nAnd although contemporary feminist philosophical debates have\nquestioned some of the tenets and details of the original 1960s\nsex/gender distinction, most still hold onto the view that gender is\nabout social factors and that it is (in some sense) distinct\nfrom biological sex. The jury is still out on what the best, the most\nuseful, or (even) the correct definition of gender is.",
