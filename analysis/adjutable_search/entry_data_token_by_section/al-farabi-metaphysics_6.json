Instead he distinguishes (at least) two senses of being\n[mawj\u00fbd], each applicable in both 1- and 2-place\ncontexts, and says that in each case there is a corresponding sense of\nexistence [wuj\u00fbd]. But he thinks that only a conflation\nbetween these two senses of being would lead us to believe that a\nbeing X exists through an existence which is both independent\nof the mind and extrinsic to the essence of X.\nF\u00e2r\u00e2b\u00ee tries to connect these two main senses of\nbeing with differences in how the term \u201cbeing\u201d is\nunderstood in different disciplines, specifically in dialectic and\ndemonstrative science, and with differences in how dialectic and\ndemonstrative science investigate the questions whether X is\nand what X is, which F\u00e2r\u00e2b\u00ee discusses in\nBook of Letters III in connection with the particles\n\u201cwhether\u201d and \u201cwhat\u201d. His discussion is\ncomplicated and difficult, but some of his main points seem to be as\nfollows.\n\nF\u00e2r\u00e2b\u00ee in Book of Letters I,88\u201394\ndescribes the different senses of being [mawj\u00fbd] and\nthe corresponding senses of existence [wuj\u00fbd],\nconcentrating on 1-place\n contexts.[22]\n Aristotle in Metaphysics V,7 distinguishes four main senses\nof being (giving mostly 2-place examples), in some cases with\nsub-senses: being per accidens, being per se (with\nsubsenses corresponding to the different categories), being as the\ntrue, and being in actuality or potentiality. F\u00e2r\u00e2b\u00ee\nhas nothing in I,88\u201394 corresponding to being per\n accidens,[23]\n and his treatment of the other main senses of being corresponds only\nroughly to Aristotle\u2019s\u2014of course, his treatment is longer\nand more detailed, and includes the discussion of existence\n[wuj\u00fbd], which does not correspond to anything in\nMetaphysics V,7. F\u00e2r\u00e2b\u00ee starts in I,88 by\ndistinguishing three main senses of being, namely the sense of being\nwhich is divided into different senses for the different categories\n(pp.115,15\u2013116,3), being as the true, i.e., what \u201cis\noutside the soul and is in itself [bi-\u201baynihi] as it is\nin the soul\u201d (p.116,3\u20136), and being as what is\n\u201ccircumscribed [mun\u1e25\u00e2z] by some quiddity\noutside the soul, whether it has been represented in the soul or has\nnot been represented\u201d (p.116,6\u20137). But in I,90 he says\nthat these three senses of being can be reduced to two, \u201cthat it\nis true and that it has some quiddity outside the soul\u201d\n(p.117,18\u201319). In this discussion F\u00e2r\u00e2b\u00ee is\ngiving his interpretation of two of Aristotle\u2019s four senses of\nbeing, being per se and being as the true. (Later, in\nI,93\u201394, he discusses being in actuality and potentiality, but\nonly as a subdivision within being as what has a quiddity outside the\nsoul, and it does not seem to play a large role in the Book of\nLetters.) In I,89, starting from the I,88 enumeration of three\nmain senses of being, he discusses what kind of existence\n[wuj\u00fbd] corresponds to each of these senses of being\n[mawj\u00fbd]; and in I,92 he tries to show that being as\nwhat has a quiddity outside the soul (unlike being as the true) is\nsaid not univocally, but of some things in more primary senses and of\nother things in derivative senses, across different categories and\neven within the category of substance.\n\nClearly the foundation of F\u00e2r\u00e2b\u00ee\u2019s account of\nbeing is his distinction between being as the true and being as what\nis circumscribed by a quiddity outside the soul. It is not immediately\nobvious what he means by this distinction, and there is no obvious\nprecedent, either in Greek or in Arabic, for his notion of\n\u201ccircumscription\u201d. At first blush, \u201cbeing outside\nthe soul and in itself as it is in the soul\u201d and \u201cbeing\ncircumscribed by some quiddity outside the soul\u201d (or\n\u201chaving some quiddity outside the soul\u201d) sound similar,\nalthough it is clear that F\u00e2r\u00e2b\u00ee wants them to be\nvery different. We might guess that the main difference is something\ncan have a quiddity outside the soul even if it is not represented in\nthe soul (as F\u00e2r\u00e2b\u00ee notes p.116,7); and in this\nsense F\u00e2r\u00e2b\u00ee says that \u201cwhatever is true is\nalso circumscribed by some quiddity outside the soul\u201d (I,91\np.117,20). But the deeper difference is that while \u201cbeing\ncircumscribed by some quiddity outside the soul\u201d is predicated\nof an external object, being in the sense of \u201ctrue\u201d, i.e.,\n\u201cbeing outside the soul as it is in the soul\u201d, is\npredicated of something in the soul, and asserts that what is in the\nsoul has something outside the soul corresponding to it. So in I,89,\nin discussing the kinds of existence [wuj\u00fbd]\ncorresponding to each sense of \u201cbeing\u201d\n[mawj\u00fbd], F\u00e2r\u00e2b\u00ee says that \u201cthe\nexistence [wuj\u00fbd] of what is true is a certain relation\nwhich\n thoughts[24]\n have to something outside the soul\u201d (p.117,4\u20135).\nF\u00e2r\u00e2b\u00ee is explicit that being in the sense of\n\u201ctrue\u201d applies not only to the soul\u2019s judgments but\nalso to its concepts (I,88 p.116,3\u20135): to say of a concept that\nit \u201cis\u201d in the sense of \u201cis true\u201d is to say\nthat it is instantiated. F\u00e2r\u00e2b\u00ee is apparently the\nfirst person to have said that existence, in one sense of existence,\nis a second-order predicate or second-order concept, a concept that is\npredicated only of concepts; but, unlike Frege, he understands\nconcepts psychologistically, as mental\n states.[25]\n\nDespite F\u00e2r\u00e2b\u00ee\u2019s saying in I,91 (cited just\nabove) that being-as-having-a-quiddity-outside-the-soul is more widely\nextended than being-as-true, it emerges from his later discussions\nthat, taking \u201cquiddity outside the soul\u201d in a strict\nsense, having a quiddity outside the soul is more demanding,\nand that we must first ask whether something is in the sense\nof true, i.e., whether a given concept is instantiated outside the\nsoul, and only then, if the answer is yes, ask whether what\ninstantiates it is also circumscribed by a quiddity outside the soul.\nIf a concept is not instantiated outside the soul, such as (for\nAristotle and F\u00e2r\u00e2b\u00ee) the concept of vacuum, then,\nwhile there vacuum has a quiddity-in-an-extended sense, since we can\nask \u201cwhat is vacuum?\u201d and answer the question by giving an\nexplanation of the name \u201cvacuum\u201d, a so-called\n\u201cnominal definition\u201d which identifies what concept the\nword \u201cvacuum\u201d stands for, nonetheless vacuum has no\nquiddity in the proper sense, and certainly no quiddity outside the\nsoul (I,91 p.118,4\u20139). Even after we have determined \u201cthat\nwhat is understood by the expression is the same outside the\nsoul\u201d, we can still ask \u201cdoes it exist [hal\nmawj\u00fbd] or not?\u201d, meaning now not \u201cis it\ntrue?\u201d but rather \u201cdoes it have some thing by which its\nconstitution [qiw\u00e2m] [is] and which is present in\nit\u201d (III,229\n p.214,4\u20139).[26]\n This will be \u201cone of the causes of its existence\u201d, so\nthat \u201cour saying \u2018does the thing exist?\u2019 in the\nsecond way\u201d is equivalent to \u201cdoes it have a cause by\nwhich its constitution [is] in its essence?\u201d (III,229\np.214,11\u201313). For\n\n\nnot everything which is understood by some expression, such that what\nis understood by it is also outside the soul, is such that it also has\nan essence: like the meaning of \u201cprivation\u201d, for it is a\nmeaning which is understood, and it is outside the soul as it is\nunderstood, but it is not an essence and does not have an essence.\n(III,240 p.218,12\u201315)\n\n\nExamples of concepts which are instantiated, but whose instantiations\nare not circumscribed by a quiddity, might include on the one hand\nnegations like not-a-horse or privations like blindness, and on the\nother hand beings per accidens, i.e., accidental combinations\nlike white horse. Each of these will have a nominal definition which\nidentifies what concept the name stands for, but it will not have a\nreal definition expressing a real quiddity, \u201cthe thing by which\nits constitution [is] and which is in it\u201d: things can be\nnot-horses or blind through many different positive causes, and a\nwhite horse will have a cause of being white and a cause of being a\nhorse, but no one cause that constitutes it as a white horse.\n\nIn Book of Letters I,88\u201390 F\u00e2r\u00e2b\u00ee\ndescribes not only the different senses of \u201cbeing\n[mawj\u00fbd]\u201d, but also the corresponding senses of\n\u201cexistence [wuj\u00fbd]\u201d, i.e., that through\nwhich a mawj\u00fbd in each sense is mawj\u00fbd.\nAs we have already seen, \u201cthe existence [wuj\u00fbd]\nof what is true is a certain relation which thoughts have to something\noutside the soul\u201d (p.117,4\u20135). The existence\n[wuj\u00fbd] of something which is a being\n[mawj\u00fbd] in the sense in which being is divided into\nthe categories will just be the category under which that thing falls,\nwhich licenses calling it a being. F\u00e2r\u00e2b\u00ee\u2019s\ntreatment of the existence [wuj\u00fbd] of something which\nis a being [mawj\u00fbd] in the sense of being circumscribed\nby some quiddity outside the soul depends on whether it is a complex\n(divisible) or a simple (indivisible) quiddity.\n\n\nAs for that whose quiddity is divisible, three [kinds of] things are\nsaid to be its quiddity: (i) its unarticulated whole, (ii) [its whole]\narticulated by the parts by which its constitution [is], (iii) each of\nthe parts of the whole, each of them through [?] the whole in turn.\nIts whole is what its name signifies, and what is articulated by its\nparts is what its definition signifies, and each of its parts is genus\nand differentia, each in turn, or matter and form, each in turn. (I,88\np.116,8\u201313)\n\n\nThe existence [wuj\u00fbd] of a being\n[mawj\u00fbd] circumscribed by a complex quiddity, but not\nof a being circumscribed by a simple quiddity, can therefore be\ndistinguished from the being itself:\n\n\nin the case of what is divided so that it has a whole and the\narticulated [result] of this whole, the being [mawj\u00fbd]\nand the existence [wuj\u00fbd] are different: the being is\n[the thing] as a whole (this is the possessor of the quiddity) and the\nexistence is the quiddity of this thing, either articulated or each of\nthe parts of the whole, either its genus or its differentia, and since\nits differentia is more proper to it, [the differentia] is more\nappropriately called the existence which is proper to it. (I,89\np.117,1\u20134)\n\n\n(F\u00e2r\u00e2b\u00ee adds that since the existence\n[wuj\u00fbd] of something which is a being in the sense of\nfalling under a category is the category or highest genus under which\nit falls, this will also be its existence as a part of its quiddity,\nso that being in the sense of falling under a category reduces to\nbeing in the sense of having a quiddity, and the initial three senses\nof being reduce to two, I,89 p.117,5\u20138 and I,90\np.117,14\u201319.) By contrast, \u201ceverything whose quiddity is\nindivisible either is a being which does not exist [yak\u00fbna\nmawj\u00fbdan l\u00e2 y\u00fbjadu]\u201d\u2014because the\nfinite verb \u201cexists\u201d is paronymous and would imply that\nexistence belongs to it as an accident\u2014\u201cor else the\nmeaning of its existence and that it exists [ma\u02bfna\nwuj\u00fbdihi wa-annahu mawj\u00fbdun] are one and the same,\nand that it is an existence [wuj\u00fbd] and that it is a\nbeing [mawj\u00fbd] are one and the same meaning\u201d,\nsince its existence [wuj\u00fbd] is not a further entity\nexplaining the fact that it is a being [mawj\u00fbd], but is\njust that being, which is simple and not explained by any further\ncause to explain it (I,89 p.117,8\u201310). This will be true both of\neach of the categories or highest genera (each category is an\nundefinable highest genus, and not a composite of being as a genus and\nsome differentia added to being), and of \u201cwhatever is not in a\nsubject and is not a subject of anything at all, for it is forever\nsimple in its quiddity\u201d (I,89\n p.117,10\u201313).[27]\n\nIn all of this F\u00e2r\u00e2b\u00ee is broadly following the\nAristotelian idea that, for any composite object X, we can\nask \u201cwhat is X?\u201d and answer the question either\nby giving a definition of X spelling X out into many\nin-some-sense-constituents of X, or by giving some one such\nconstituent of X, which is a partial answer to\n\u201cwhat is\n X?\u201d.[28]\n F\u00e2r\u00e2b\u00ee is also following Aristotle in insisting\nthat all of the things which should be mentioned in the definition of\nX are causes of X\u2019s being (\u201cthe thing by\nwhich [X\u2019s] constitution [is]\u201d), and,\nfurthermore, essential causes, in the sense that it is not simply that\nsome instance of X happens for this reason, but that a thing\nwouldn\u2019t be X if it weren\u2019t caused in this way:\naccording to Aristotle in Metaphysics VIII,4, a scientific\ndefinition of X should mention all and only such causes of\nX. He is also following Aristotle in saying that this process\nmust come to a stop with simples, where there will be no further\ndefinition and no distinction between the thing and any further answer\nto \u201cwhat is it?\u201d. He also follows Aristotle further down,\nin Book of Letters III,244, in saying that in asking for the\ncause of X\u2019s being, we cannot look for a middle term\nbetween the subject and predicate of \u201cX is [X\nmawj\u00fbd]\u201d, or between the subject and predicate of\n\u201cX is X\u201d. Rather, we must unpack this\njudgment so that its subject and predicate are different, so that we\ncan seek a middle term connecting them (\u201cwhy are there\neclipses?\u201d might be unpacked as \u201cwhy is the moon\neclipsed?\u201d or \u201cwhy is the moon darkened at\nopposition?\u201d): if X is simple, so that\n\u201cX is\u201d cannot be unpacked into a judgment with\ndistinct subject and predicate, then there is no further investigation\ninto why X is, and therefore also not into what X\n is.[29]\n But F\u00e2r\u00e2b\u00ee is putting all of this in the service of\nan argument which has no direct parallel in Aristotle, that, contrary\nto the linguistic appearance of the paronymous term\nmawj\u00fbd (being or existent), a thing does not exist\nthrough an accident of existence [wuj\u00fbd] as it is white\nthrough an accident of whiteness (so I,84, p.113,9\u201314, cited\nabove). If we say that X exists [mawj\u00fbd] in\nthe sense that X is true, then the existence\n[wuj\u00fbd] of X is not an attribute of the real\nthing X outside the mind, but only an attribute of the mental\nconcept of X, namely, that that concept is instantiated\noutside the mind. If we say that X exists\n[mawj\u00fbd] in the sense that X is circumscribed\nby a real quiddity, then the existence [wuj\u00fbd] of\nX is that quiddity: either it is the whole essence of\nX as spelled out by its definition, or it is some part of the\nessence of X, or if X is simple it is just\nX itself, but in no case is it an accident of X.\n(F\u00e2r\u00e2b\u00ee also says similar things about two-places\nuses of mawj\u00fbd as a tenseless copula \u201cX\nis Y\u201d: particularly in I,101 he argues that\n\u201cX is Y\u201d has a sense which does not\nassert, e.g., that the quiddity of X is to be Y, or\nthat either X or Y have real quiddities outside the\nmind. What it asserts is something like two-place being-as-truth, but\nF\u00e2r\u00e2b\u00ee says that such a sentence need not assert\nthat something is outside the mind as it is in the mind,\nsince in some \u201cX is Y\u201d is true although\nneither X nor Y exists outside the mind.)\n\nF\u00e2r\u00e2b\u00ee\u2019s distinction between being-as-true and\nbeing-as-having-a-quiddity-outside-the-mind also allows him to resolve\nthe issue about whether being is univocal or whether it is said of one\nthing (or of one kind of thing) primarily and of other things in a\ndependent and derivative sense. Looking only at one-place cases,\nbeing-as-true must be univocal to beings in all categories, and also\nto beings in no category such as negations or privations and beings\nper accidens like white horse. For I must be able to ask\n\u201cis the concept of X instantiated?\u201d before I know\nwhat category the instances of X will fall under, or even\nwhether X will turn out to be merely a privation, or an\naccidental combination of two positive entities. (If X is\neclipse, we might reasonably start by keeping many of these options\nopen: only the investigation of actual eclipses, if it turns out that\nthere are some, will determine which option is right.) By contrast,\n\u201cwhat has a quiddity outside the soul, although [being in this\nsense] is general, is said by priority and posteriority in\norder\u201d (I,92 p.118,14\u201316), since if the quiddity of\nX involves a reference to Y as the cause of\nexistence to X, then Y has a prior and stronger\nclaim than X to have a quiddity outside the soul, rendering\nit capable of independent existence. First, substances will be prior\nin this way to accidents, since for an accident to be is for it to\nbelong to a substance, and the scientific definition of any kind of\naccident will mention the kind of substance that it can be predicated\nof. But then, within the category of substance, \u201cwhat requires a\ndifferentia or genus in this category in order for its quiddity to be\nrealized is more deficient with respect to quiddity than the thing in\nthis category which is a cause of the realization of its\nquiddity\u201d, and by pursuing causes of quiddities in this way we\ncan come to some first substance, \u201cwhether this is one or more\nthan one\u201d, which has a stronger claim to the title of\n\u201cbeing\u201d than all other substances, and a fortiori\nthan accidents (I,92 pp.118,18\u2013119,4).\n\n\nAnd if something is discovered outside all these categories which is\nthe\n cause[30]\n of the realization of the quiddity of the most\n fundamental[31]\n thing in this category [i.e., the category of substance], then this\n*is more deserving to be called \u201cbeing\u201d\n[mawj\u00fbd] than the most perfect thing in this category,\nand this is the first cause of existence [wuj\u00fbd] to the\nmost perfect thing in this category, and this most perfect thing [sc.\nwithin the category of substance] is the cause in the quiddity\n of*[32]\n the other things in this category, and what is in this category is\nthe cause in the quiddity of the other categories: thus the beings,\nwhere what is meant by \u201cbeing\u201d is what has a quiddity\noutside the soul, are ordered by this order. (I,92\np.119,4\u20138)\n\n\nIt was traditional enough to say that God (and only God) is being in\nthe strictest sense, and is the cause of existence to all other\nbeings. But F\u00e2r\u00e2b\u00ee\u2019s version is importantly\ndifferent. F\u00e2r\u00e2b\u00ee is taking up Aristotle\u2019s\nprogram of defining each thing through its essential cause, and\narguing that this kind of cause of X\u2019s existing (such\nthat something would not be an X if it were caused in some\nother way) is the existence [wuj\u00fbd] of\nX and has a stronger claim to the title of being\n[mawj\u00fbd] than X: if this causal chain leads\nultimately to God, so that God is ultimately involved in the quiddity\nof each other thing, then F\u00e2r\u00e2b\u00ee will have a\nscientific Aristotelian way of filling in the program of the Aims\nof the Metaphysics, of showing how an analysis of being and of\nits causes (once we grasp the relevant senses of being and of cause)\nwill lead to God as the first cause of being and universal first\nprinciple. As this is presented in the Book of Letters, it is\njust a program for research, which might or might not lead up to a\nsingle first cause of existence from which all other beings can be\nderived carried out. But in the Perfect City and the\nPolitical Regime F\u00e2r\u00e2b\u00ee gives at least a\nsketch of the upward causal argument to God as a single first cause of\nexistence, and of the downward path from God to all other beings.\nF\u00e2r\u00e2b\u00ee sees a charter for this causal investigation\nof the existence of thing especially in Aristotle\u2019s\nPosterior Analytics II.\n",
