    "main_text": "\n1. Noncausal Theories\n\nNoncausal theories of free will are those according to which free\nactions need not be caused by anything and also need not have any\ninternal causal structure. Some theories of this sort hold that free\nactions must be uncaused, while others allow that they may be\nnondeterministically caused. Carl Ginet (1989, 1990, 1997, 2002, 2007,\n2008, 2014, and 2016) and Hugh McCann (1998 and 2012) have set out the\nmost fully developed noncausal theories of free will. Other accounts\nof this type are advanced by Stewart Goetz (1988, 1997, and 2000), E.\nJ. Lowe (2008: chs. 6\u20139 and 2013), Storrs McCall (1994: ch. 9),\nDavid Palmer (2016, forthcoming), and Thomas Pink (2004: chs.\n7\u20138).\n\nWhy might someone find a noncausal theory of free will appealing? An\nhistorically important motivation for such views concerns the nature\nof causation. Once upon a time, all causation was thought to be\ndeterministic. If that were right, then any nondeterministic theory of\nfree will would have to be noncausal. Not until the 20th century did\nthe idea of nondeterministic or probabilistic causation become\npopular. Once it did, this motivation for noncausal theories of free\nwill was lost. Why, then, do some theorists still insist that free\nactions must be uncaused?\n\n\nOne argument advanced for that conclusion is an argument from luck.\nThe idea, in brief, is that if an action is caused (even\nnondeterministically) by prior events, then it cannot have been up to\nthe agent whether that action was performed. If the causation is\nnondeterministic, it will simply be a matter of luck, a matter of\nnature\u2019s \u201crole of the dice\u201d (Ginet 2014: 24) whether\nthe action occurs. Such an argument from luck poses a problem for\nevent-causal libertarian theories, and agent-causal libertarian\ntheories face a similar problem. We discuss responses available in\ndefense of these theories below, in sections 2.2, 2.3, and 3.2.\n\nNoncausal theories of free will face two main objections. Both are\nobjections, in the first instance, to noncausal accounts of\nintentional action. If the theories at issue can\u2019t give an\nadequate noncausal account of action, then a fortiori they can\u2019t\ngive us an adequate account of free action. Noncausal theories that\nrequire free actions to be entirely uncaused face a further objection,\nin addition to the two just mentioned. We consider each of these\nobjections in turn.\n1.1 Control\n\nThe first objection to noncausal theories of free will concerns\ncontrol. Performing an action\u2014even acting unfreely\u2014is\noften thought to involve active control over what one does, and acting\nfreely is thought to involve an especially valuable variety of such\ncontrol. An account of free will ought to say what this latter variety\nof control is or in what its exercise consists. A common objection is\nthat noncausal accounts fail to do that.\n\nAccounts of active control often appeal to causation. Exercising such\ncontrol when one acts, it is said, consists in causing some event (the\naction, or an event internal to that action). It is often further held\nthat causation by an agent consists entirely in causation by mental\nevents or states of certain kinds, such as the agent\u2019s desiring,\nbelieving, or intending something in particular. Of course, noncausal\ntheories reject any such view, but what alternative have they to offer\nus?\n\nOn Ginet\u2019s view, each basic action is characterized by an actish\nphenomenal quality, its seeming to the agent as if she is directly\nmaking happen the event that is her basic action. Ginet stresses the\n\u201cas if\u201d nature of this appearance; it does not, he says,\nliterally represent to the agent that she is causing the event in\nquestion. And in fact, he holds, it cannot be true that we really are\nagent-causes of what we do, and it need not be the case that any\nevents involving us cause our actions.\n\nMight the actish feel of some occurrence itself constitute that\nevent\u2019s activeness, the agent\u2019s exercise of active\ncontrol? Can an event\u2019s seeming to oneself to be one\u2019s\nperforming an action suffice for its being so? This seems doubtful. As\nGinet (1990: 9) allows, an event with the indicated intrinsic quality\nmight be brought about by direct stimulation of someone\u2019s brain,\nin the absence of any relevant desire or intention on the part of that\nperson. An occurrence produced in this way and in these circumstances\nwould hardly seem to be an exercise of the subject\u2019s agency.\n\nMcCann (1998: 180) holds that an agent\u2019s exercise of active\ncontrol has two aspects: any basic action is a spontaneous, creative\nundertaking on the part of the agent, and it is intrinsically\nintentional. The intentionality of a basic action is said not to\nrequire any internal causal structure or external causal relation, yet\nit may be doubted that something\u2019s being done intentionally can\nbe altogether divorced in this way from causation. Further, supposing\nthat such intrinsic intentionality is possible, it would seem that\nhere too an event with this feature could be brought about by direct\nstimulation of someone\u2019s brain, in the absence of any relevant\ndesire or prior intention on the part of that person. But, again, such\nan occurrence, even if intrinsically something the agent means to be\nan exercise of her agency, hardly seems to be that.\n\nThe other aspect of the control that McCann says is exercised in basic\naction\u2014the spontaneity or activeness of such an\noccurrence\u2014thus appears to be the crucial one. This aspect, too,\nMcCann holds, is intrinsic to basic actions, and he maintains that\n\u201cit has a certain sui generis character that renders it\nincapable of being reduced to anything else\u201d (1998: 185). Other\nproponents of noncausal theories of action (e.g., Pink 2004: ch. 8;\nPalmer forthcoming) likewise take the exercise of active control to be\nan ontologically fundamental or irreducible thing. Whether it is\nremains controversial.\n1.2 Reason-Explanation\n\nThe second challenge facing non-causal theories of free will concerns\nacting for a reason. Free actions can be (and commonly are) done for\nreasons. An action performed for a reason is something for which there\nis a true reason-explanation. It is often objected that noncausal\ntheories of free will cannot provide an adequate account of this\nphenomenon.\n\nAccounts of acting for a reason and of reason-explanation often appeal\nto causation. An agent acts for a certain reason, it is said, only if\nthe agent\u2019s recognizing that reason causes, in an appropriate\nway, the agent\u2019s behavior; and citing a reason contributes to a\n(true) reason-explanation of an action only if the agent\u2019s\nrecognizing that reason caused the action in an appropriate way.\nProponents of noncausal theories generally go for one or another of\ntwo alternative accounts, appealing either to the content of an\nintention that the agent is said to have concurrently with performing\nthe action, or to the intentional content of the action itself.\n\nTo examine the first of these strategies, suppose that S wants her\nglasses, which she has left in her friend T\u2019s room, where he is\nnow sleeping. S also wants to wake T, because she desires his company,\nbut she knows that T needs some sleep, and hence she desires, too, not\nto wake him. S decides to enter T\u2019s room and does so, believing\nas she does that her action will contribute to the satisfaction of\nboth the desire to get her glasses and the desire to wake T. (The\nexample is adapted from Ginet 1990: 145.) What further facts about the\nsituation could make it the case that, in entering the room, S acts on\nher desire to get her glasses, and that citing that desire provides a\ntrue reason-explanation of her action, while she does not act on her\ndesire to wake T, and citing this latter desire does not give us a\ntrue reason-explanation of what she is doing?\n\nGinet\u2019s account of reason-explanations that cite antecedent\ndesires (1990: 143) implies that the following conditions suffice for\nthe truth of the explanation that cites S\u2019s desire to get her\nglasses:\n\n(a) prior to entering the room, S had a desire to get her\nglasses, and\n\n\n(b) concurrently with entering the room, S remembers that\nprior desire and intends of her entering the room that it satisfy (or\ncontribute to satisfying) that desire.\n\n\nGiven the indicated circumstances, citing S\u2019s desire to wake T\nwill fail to give us a true reason-explanation, Ginet holds, just in\ncase S does not intend of her action that it satisfy (or contribute to\nsatisfying) that desire.\n\nSeveral objections can be raised against this account. Suppose that,\nalthough conditions (a) and (b) are fulfilled as S enters the room,\nher desire to get her glasses plays no role at all in bringing about\n(causing) her entry, while her desire to wake T, of which she is fully\naware when she acts, does play such a role. Causalists (e.g., Mele\n1992: ch. 13) will then deny that S really acts on her desire to get\nher glasses and that citing it truly explains her action. Indeed, even\nsome noncausalists deny that having a concurrent intention of the sort\nrequired by Ginet (together with awareness of the antecedent desire)\nsuffices for acting for the reason in question. As McCann (1998: 163)\nsuggests, one might have such an intention but fail to carry it out.\nAn account that requires a concurrent intention of this sort, then,\nwill need to provide for its implementation.\n\nTwo further problems attend the concurrent intention that is required.\nFirst, the required intention is a second-order attitude, an attitude\nabout (among other things) another of the agent\u2019s own attitudes\n(a certain desire of hers). But it seems that S might act on her\ndesire to get her glasses even if her only intention when she enters\nthe room is to retrieve her glasses. Second, intention-acquisitions\nthemselves can be explained by citing reasons. Since Ginet\u2019s\naccount of the reason-explanation of an action appeals to an\nintention, the question arises what can be said about the\nreason-explanation of the acquisition of that intention. Repeating the\nsame sort of account here would generate a regress.\n\nMcCann (1998: ch. 8 and 2012) takes a different approach. On his view,\nan agent decides for a certain reason, and citing that reason explains\nthe decision, just in case, in cognizance of that reason, and in an\nintrinsically intentional act of intention formation, the agent forms\nan intention the content of which reflects the very goals presented in\nthat reason. When S decides to enter T\u2019s room, for example, she\ndecides for the reason of getting her glasses only if the intention\nthat she forms in making that decision is an intention to enter for\nthe sake of getting her glasses. (Ginet [2008] offers a similar\naccount of reasons-explanations of decisions.)\n\nOne question about this account is whether what it proposes suffices\nfor acting for a reason. Here again there will be a clash of\nintuitions between causalists and noncausalists, with the former\nmaintaining that if S\u2019s desire to get her glasses plays no role\nat all in bringing about her decision, then even if the content of her\ndecision is to enter for the sake of getting her glasses, she does not\nreally decide for that reason and citing it does not truly explain her\ndecision.\n\nAnother question about the account concerns whether the required\ncorrespondence between the reasons for which one decides and the\ncontent of one\u2019s decision is really necessary. Sometimes prior\nto making a decision, an agent considers a large number and variety of\nfactors. Her decision might then be made for many different reasons.\nIt is implausible that each and every one of the reasons for which she\nmakes her decision must enter into the content of the intention that\nshe forms in making that decision. (For the same objection to a\nsimilar account of reason-explanation, see Mele 2003:\n42\u201343.)\n1.3 Free Actions with Causes?\n\nA third objection is directed at those noncausal theories of free will\naccording to which free actions must be entirely uncaused.\nIncompatibilists often contend that determinism precludes the ability\nand opportunity to do otherwise and/or the ultimate sourcehood that\n(they allege) is required for free will. But an action\u2019s being\nnondeterministically caused, it has been argued, is unlike determinism\nin this respect, as it is consistent with these requirements being\nsatisfied (Capes 2017). If so, then free actions need not be\ncompletely uncaused, even if they can be.\n2. Event-Causal Theories\n\nCompatibilist accounts of free action are typically event-causal\nviews, invoking event-causal accounts of action. The simplest\nevent-causal incompatibilist theory takes the requirements of a good\ncompatibilist account and adds that certain agent-involving events\nthat cause the action must nondeterministically cause it. When these\nconditions are satisfied, it is held, the agent exercises in\nperforming her action a certain variety of active control (which is\nsaid to consist in the action\u2019s being caused, in an appropriate\nway, by those agent-involving events), the action is performed for a\nreason, and there remains, until she acts, a chance of the\nagent\u2019s not performing that action. (It might be required that\nthere remains, until the action is performed, a chance that the agent\nwill perform a different action instead right then.) It is thus said\nto be open to the agent to do otherwise, even given that (it is\nclaimed) its being so open is incompatible with the truth of\ndeterminism.\n\nOne purported problem for such a view is that the indeterminism that\nit requires is destructive, that it would diminish the control with\nwhich an agent acts to the extent that responsibility would be\nundermined. The most common version of this worry is the problem of\nluck, which holds that indeterminism reduces control by introducing\nluck. A second common objection is the problem of enhanced control,\nwhich holds that the required indeterminism is superfluous, that it\nadds nothing of value that could not exist in a deterministic world.\nWe shall examine these objections below. First, let us consider a type\nof event-causal incompatibilist account that is advocated by writers\nwho accept a qualified version of the first of these objections.\n2.1 Deliberative Indeterminism\n\nSome writers accept that indeterminism located in the immediate\ncausation of a decision or other action would diminish the\nagent\u2019s control but hold that indeterminism confined to earlier\nstages in the process leading to a decision need not do so. Laura\nEkstrom (2000: ch. 4 and 2003) and Alfred Mele (1995: ch. 12, 1996,\n1999b, and 2006: 9\u201314) have advanced the most fully developed\naccounts of this sort. Such views have also been sketched by Daniel\nDennett (1978) and John Martin Fischer (1995).\n\nOvert action is sometimes preceded by a decision, and decision is\nsometimes preceded by a deliberative process in which the agent\nconsiders reasons for and against alternatives and makes an evaluative\njudgment concerning which alternative is best (or better or good\nenough). Focusing on decisions that follow such deliberation, Mele\nadvances a view that allows (but does not require) the deterministic\ncausation of the decision by the making of the judgment, and of the\novert action by the decision. Indeterminism is required only at an\nearlier stage of the deliberative process. For example, the account is\nsatisfied when it is undetermined which of a certain subset of the\nagent\u2019s nonoccurrent beliefs come to mind in the process of\ndeliberation, where their coming to mind combines with other events to\nbring about the agent\u2019s evaluative judgment. (The subset in\nquestion consists of \u201cbeliefs whose coming or not coming to mind\nis not something that one would control even if determinism were\ntrue\u201d [1995: 216].)\n\nMele argues that indeterminism of the sort required here does not\ndiminish (at least not to any significant extent) what he calls\n\u201cproximal control,\u201d a variety of control constituted by\nthe relatively direct causation of behavior, and one that is\ncompatible with determinism. The required indeterminism nevertheless\nsuffices, he holds, to provide the agent with \u201cultimate\ncontrol\u201d over her decision, which an agent has only if at no\ntime prior to the decision is there any causally sufficient condition\nfor the agent\u2019s making that decision that consists entirely of\nevents or states external to the agent.\n\nEkstrom (2019) has recently criticized her older account and defended\na centered view of the sort discussed in the next section. But her\nprevious account is worthy of consideration. Ekstrom\u2019s account\nemphasized preference rather than evaluative judgment. A preference,\nas she understands it, is a desire \u201cformed by a process of\ncritical evaluation with respect to one\u2019s conception of the\ngood\u201d (2000: 106). The formation of a preference, she\nmaintained, is an action. She required indeterminism only in the\nproduction of these preferences. A decision or other action is free,\non her view, just in case it is brought about, in an appropriate way,\nby an active formation of a preference (favoring that decision or\naction), which preference-formation is in turn the result of an\nuncoerced exercise of the agent\u2019s evaluative faculty, the inputs\nto which nondeterministically cause that preference-formation.\n\nEkstrom held that an agent is her preferences and acceptances\n(reflectively held beliefs), together with her faculty of forming\nthese by reflective evaluation. When the formation of a preference is\nnondeterministically caused and it deterministically causes a decision\nand subsequent action, then a preference that partly constitutes the\nagent, one that is generated by an evaluative faculty that partly\nconstitutes the agent, and one that the agent could have prevented (by\nnot forming that preference) causally determines the decision and\nsubsequent action. What the agent does is then, Ekstrom claimed, up to\nher.\n\nBoth Mele\u2019s and Ekstrom\u2019s deliberative theories allow that\na decision or other action can be free even if it is causally\ndetermined by events none of which is a free action, and to none of\nwhich has the agent contributed by performing any prior free action.\nIndeed, given the basic features of these accounts, both of them must\n(on pain of regress) allow this. Incompatibilists do not typically\nallow for such a thing.\n\nIf an event is not itself a free action, and if no free action by the\nagent in question contributed to that event, then, we may say, it is\nnot up to the agent whether that event occurs. Incompatibilists\ngenerally hold that if one event determines another, then it is not up\nto anybody whether if the first event occurs then the second event\noccurs. And arguments for incompatibilism often employ a principle\nlike the following: if it is not up to a given agent whether a certain\nevent occurs, and it is not up to that agent whether if that event\noccurs then the agent performs a certain action, then it is not up to\nthe agent whether she performs that action. Given this principle, it\nwill have to be said of certain decisions that deliberative theorists\ncount as free that it is not up to us whether we make those decisions.\nDeliberative theorists, then, apparently reject this principle; but\nthe rejection raises the question whether their incompatibilism is\nwell motivated.\n2.2 Centered Accounts\n\nEvent-causal accounts of a more typical sort require that at least\nsome free actions be nondeterministically caused by their immediate\ncausal antecedents. Since these views require indeterminism centered\non the production of free actions themselves, we may call them\n\u201ccentered accounts.\u201d The most widely discussed such view\nis that advanced by Robert Kane (1985, 1989, 1994, 1996a, 1996b,\n1999a, 1999b, 2000a, 2000b, 2000c, 2002, 2004, 2005: chs. 11\u201312,\n2007a, 2007b, 2011, 2014a, 2014b, 2016, and 2019). (It should\nbe noted that Kane now rejects the event-causal label, insisting the\nthere is no event-causal reduction of agency; however, it is not clear\nthat he denies that agency is always fully realized in causation by\nevents, and his view focuses on causation by events in exercises of\nagency.) Other accounts of this type are proposed by Mark Balaguer\n(1999 and 2004), Laura Ekstrom (2019), Christopher Franklin (2011a,\n2011b, 2018), David Hodgson (2012), Alfred Mele (2006: ch. 5), Robert\nNozick (1981:294\u2013316), Richard Sorabji (1980: chs. 2 and 14),\nPeter van Inwagen (1983: 137\u201350), and David Wiggins (1973). John\nSearle (2001: ch. 9) endorses a view of this sort as best capturing\nour experience of acting.\n\nConsider an illustration of a simple centered incompatibilist theory.\nSuppose that Elena is considering whether to A or to B. She recognizes\nwhat she regards as fairly strong reasons to A, and she recognizes\nwhat she regards as somewhat weaker reasons to B. At a certain time,\nt, she decides to A. The account requires that the prior deliberative\nevents (such as Elena\u2019s recognizing the reasons to A and judging\nthem to be stronger) that cause the decision to A nondeterministically\ncause it, and that until Elena makes that decision, there remains a\nchance that she not make that decision then. (We may imagine that\nthere remains a chance that, instead, she decides at t to B, in which\ncase prior deliberative events, such as her recognizing the reasons to\nB, will have nondeterministically caused this alternative\ndecision).\n\nAccounts of this sort are often thought to be vulnerable to the\nproblem of luck. There are a various formulations of the problem of\nluck. (Versions of it are advanced by Almeida and Bernstein [2003],\nEkstrom [2000: 105], Haji [1999a, 1999b, 2000a, 2000b, 2000c, and\n2001], Levy [2011: ch. 3], and Strawson [1994]. Mele [1998, 1999a,\n1999b, 2005, and 2006: chs 1 and 5] discusses the argument but rejects\nits conclusion.) Here is one version: suppose an agent decides to\nsteal. If there was a chance, right at the moment of choice, that the\nagent will instead (at that moment) make a different decision, then\nthere is a possible world that is exactly the same as the actual world\nup until the time of the decision, but in which the agent makes the\nalternative decision then. There is, then, nothing about the agent\nprior to the decision\u2014indeed, there is nothing about the world\nprior to that time\u2014that accounts for the difference between her\nmaking one decision and her making the other. This difference, then,\nis just a matter of luck. And if the difference between the\nagent\u2019s making one decision and her instead making another is\njust a matter of luck, she cannot be responsible for the decision that\nshe makes.\n\nOne response to the problem of luck rejects the claim that there is\nnothing about the agent prior to the decision that accounts for the\ndifference between her making one decision and her making the other.\nAfter all, the agent acted for reasons (e.g., a desire for money). If\nthose reasons raised the probability of deciding to steal and\nnon-deterministically caused the decision, that is enough to account\nfor the decision (in a sense that makes it not just a matter of luck).\nIn the world where she decides not to steal, the reasons that increase\nthe probability of that choice (e.g., a desire to act rightly) would\nthen account for the alternative decision. No matter what the agent\nchooses, we can give a contrastive explanation of her action (this\nmeans we can explain why she chose that act rather than the\nalternative.) Franklin (2018) develops (more complex) replies along\nthese lines.\n\nAnother response to the problem of luck is offered by Mele (2006:\n117\u201333). Mele invokes an agent\u2019s influence, by way of her\npast actions, on which options are currently open to her and what\ntheir respective probabilities are. Given her responsibility for those\npast actions, the agent might be responsible for the current\nprobabilities of her pursuing these alternatives. For example, Elena\nmight be responsible for the present chance that she will decide\ncontrary to her ranking of her reasons, because she is responsible for\npast actions that led to her now having features\u2014character\ntraits, desires, and so forth\u2014that ground that chance. An agent\nmight, in this fashion, accumulate over the course of her lifetime\ngreater responsibility for what she does, by increasingly shaping the\nprobabilities of her acting in various ways.\n\nOf course, the maneuver raises a question about how the agent could be\nresponsible for her earlier actions, given that the account in\nquestion will require that some of these, too, were\nnondeterministically caused. Ultimately, we must consider how an agent\ncan be responsible, on such a view, for her earliest free\ndecisions.\n\nThese earliest free decisions, Mele observes, will be those of a\nrelatively young child. Responsibility comes in degrees, and any\nresponsibility such a child has for what she does will be slight. The\nargument from luck might seem threatening if we think that full\nresponsibility is in question, but it loses its bite, Mele suggests,\nwhen we consider a case in which only a small degree of responsibility\nis at issue. It is implausible, for example, to say that a young boy\nwho decides not to snatch away his sister\u2019s toy deserves no\ncredit at all for making the right decision, just because there\nremained until he so decided a chance that he would instead decide to\ntake the toy. Kane (e.g., at 2007b: 174\u201375) makes a similar\nappeal to the build-up of responsibility stemming from slight\nresponsibility for one\u2019s earliest free choices.\n\nCentered accounts also face the problem of enhanced control. Note that\nthe simple centered account we are considering differs from typical\ncompatibilist accounts only by requiring that the agent\u2019s mental\nstates nondeterministically cause her decision. How does this\ndifference in the nature of the causal relationship do anything to\nenhance the agent\u2019s control over her act?\n\n\nA popular response to this question says that indeterminism enhances\ncontrol because it is necessary for the agent to possess the ability\nor opportunity to do otherwise. And having the ability or opportunity\nto do otherwise increases control. Franklin (2011a and 2018) and\nEkstrom (2019) offer responses along these lines. Kane makes a similar\npoint. On the indeterministic picture: an agent exercises dual\ncontrol, a control that can be exercised in either of two different\nways, whereas on the deterministic picture the agent\u2019s control\ncan be exercised in only one way (Kane 1996: 109\u201311).\n\nSome proponents of centered incompatibilist theories have added to the\nrequirements of the rather simple view we have been considering, with\nthe aim of rebutting the problem of luck. We shall examine here the\naccount advanced by Robert Kane.\n2.3 Efforts of Will\n\nKane holds that a free decision or other free action is one for which\nthe agent is \u201cultimately responsible\u201d (1996b: 35).\nUltimate responsibility for an action requires either that the action\nnot be causally determined or, if the action is causally determined,\nthat any determining cause of it either be or result (at least in\npart) from some action by that agent that was not causally determined\n(and for which the agent was ultimately responsible). Thus, on\nKane\u2019s view, an agent can be ultimately responsible for a\ndecision that is causally determined by her possessing certain\ncharacter traits. But somewhere among the events that contributed\n(however indirectly) to her having those traits, and thus to her\ndecision, there must have been some free actions by her that were not\ncausally determined. Kane calls such \u201cregress-stopping\u201d\nactions \u201cself-forming actions\u201d (74). All self-forming\nactions, he argues, are acts of will; they are mental actions. He thus\ncalls them \u201cself-forming willings\u201d (125), or SFWs.\n\nKane identifies six different types of SFW, giving the most detailed\ntreatment to what he calls moral choices or decisions and prudential\nchoices or decisions. We shall focus here on the former; the two are\nsufficiently similar that the points made can be easily transferred to\nthe latter.\n\nIn a case of moral choice, there is a motivational conflict within the\nagent. She believes that a certain type of thing morally ought to be\ndone (and she is motivated to do that), but she also has a\nself-interested desire to perform an action of a type that is, in the\ncircumstances, incompatible with her doing what she believes she ought\nto do. Given her commitment to her moral belief, she makes an effort\nof will to resist temptation, an effort \u201cto get [her] ends or\npurposes sorted out\u201d (1996b: 126). If the choice is to be an\nSFW, then it is required that the strength of this effort be\nindeterminate; Kane likens its indeterminacy to that of the position\nor momentum of a microphysical particle. And the effort\u2019s\nindeterminacy is held to be the source of the required indeterminism\nin the causal production of the choice. Again an analogy is drawn with\nan indeterministic understanding of microphysics. Just as whether a\nparticle will penetrate a barrier might be undetermined because the\nparticle does not have both a determinate position and a determinate\nmomentum, so \u201c[t]he choice one way or the other is undetermined\nbecause the process preceding and potentially terminating in it (i.e.,\nthe effort of will to overcome temptation) is indeterminate\u201d\n(128).\n\nKane further requires that any choice that is an SFW satisfy three\nplurality conditions. These require that the choice be made for a\nreason (which Kane takes to consist partly in the choice\u2019s being\ncaused by the agent\u2019s recognizing that reason) and that it not\nbe a result of coercion or compulsion. Each plurality condition also\nrequires that, when the agent makes the choice, she wants more to act\non the reason for which she makes that choice than she wants to act on\nany competing reasons. An agent wants more to act on a certain reason,\nhe holds, when her desire to act on that reason has greater\nmotivational strength than have any desires she has to act on\ncompeting reasons, and when it is settled in the agent\u2019s mind\nthat that reason, rather than her reasons for doing otherwise, is the\none that she will now and in the future act on. This wanting more to\nact on a certain reason is, on Kane\u2019s view, brought about by the\nchoice in question. Finally, the plurality conditions require that,\nwhichever choice is made, there must have been at least one\nalternative choice that the agent was able to make such that, had she\nmade it, it too would have satisfied the previously stated\nconditions.\n\nIn a situation of moral conflict, Kane maintains, the requirements for\nbeing an SFW can be satisfied by either choice that is made\u2014the\nchoice to do what one believes one ought to do or the choice to do\nwhat one is tempted to do. Where this is so, whichever choice the\nagent makes, she has chosen for the reason that she wants more to act\non, free from coercion and compulsion. If she has chosen to do what\nshe believes she ought to do, then her choice is the result of her\neffort. If she has chosen to do what she was tempted to do, then she\nhas not allowed her effort to succeed. Whichever choice she has made,\nshe could have made the other. She is then ultimately responsible for\nthe choice she has made.\n\nWhat, then, of the argument from luck? Kane offers a complex response\nto this problem. First (1996b: 171\u201372), he counters that with\nindeterminate events, exact sameness is not defined. If an\nagent\u2019s effort of will was indeterminate, then it cannot be that\nin the actual world and in some other possible world she made exactly\nthe same effort. An objection that assumes that such exact sameness is\npossible, he holds, does not apply to his view. Kane infers from this\npoint that free will requires a form of indeterminism in which there\nis chance as well as indeterminacy, with the former stemming from the\nlatter. (He calls worlds with such indeterminism\n\u201cnon-Epicurean.\u201d) The chance in an Epicurean world (an\nindeterministic world without indeterminacy), he implies, would\nconstitute control-diminishing luck.\n\nKane\u2019s claim that indeterminacy precludes exact sameness has\nbeen contested (see Clarke 1999, 2002, 2003a, and 2003b: 86\u201387,\nand O\u2019Connor 1996). Moreover, Ishtiyaque Haji (1999a) and Alfred\nMele (1999a and 1999b) contend that the argument from luck is just as\neffective if we consider an agent in worlds that are as similar as can\nbe until the moment of choice, given the indeterminacy of efforts.\nIndeed, the argument might be advanced without any appeal at all to\nother worlds: given that nothing prior to the choice accounts for the\ndifference between the agent\u2019s choosing one way and her choosing\nanother, it may be said, this difference is just a matter of luck.\n\nA further response by Kane to the argument from luck appeals to the\nactive nature of efforts of will. When an agent in a case of moral\nconflict makes an effort to resist temptation, he says, she is trying\nto make the choice to do what she believes she ought to do. If the\nagent then makes that choice, she succeeds, despite the indeterminism,\nat doing what she was actively trying to do. And Kane points out that\ntypically, when someone so succeeds, indeterminism of this sort will\nnot undermine responsibility (and hence it will not so diminish the\nagent\u2019s control that there is not enough for responsibility). He\ndescribes a case (1999b: 227) in which a man hits a glass tabletop\nattempting to shatter it. Even if it is undetermined whether his\neffort will succeed, Kane notes, if the man does succeed, he may well\nbe responsible for breaking the tabletop.\n\nIf left here, the reply would fail to address the problem of luck in a\ncase in which the agent chooses to do what she is tempted to do rather\nthan what she believes she ought to do. In response to this\nshortcoming, Kane (1999a, 1999b, 2000b, 2000c, 2002, 2005: ch. 12,\n2007, and 2011) has proposed a \u201cdoubling\u201d of effort in\ncases of moral conflict. In such a case, he holds, the agent makes\ntwo, simultaneous efforts of will, both indeterminate in strength. The\nagent tries to make the moral choice, and at the same time she tries\nto make the self-interested choice. Whichever choice she makes, then,\nshe succeeds, despite the indeterminism, at doing something that she\nwas actively trying to do.\n\nAlthough it is common to try to make a choice whether to do something\nor not\u2014for example, to try to decide whether to A\u2014it is\nunclear what sense can be made of trying to make some specific\nchoice\u2014e.g., trying to decide to A. Further, supposing that\nsense can be made of this, it would not seem to be rational to try, at\none time, to make each of two obviously incompatible choices.\n\nA more fundamental problem concerns the efficacy of the appeal to the\nactive nature of such efforts. In the case of the man who breaks the\ntabletop, his breaking the tabletop is free (if it is) not just\nbecause it results from an active effort to break the tabletop, but\nbecause it results (we are to presume) from a free effort to break the\ntabletop. A successful effort to make a certain choice can contribute\nin an analogous way to the choice\u2019s being free, then, only if\nthe effort itself is free. If the appeal to these efforts is to\naccomplish anything, then, what is needed is an account of the freedom\nwith which the agent acts in making these efforts of will (Clarke\n2002, 2003a, and 2003b: 89\u201392; Mele 2006: 51\u201352).\n\nIn recent work, Kane (e.g., at 2007b: 174\u201375) accepts that\nresponsibility for choices that are SFWs requires that we be\nresponsible for the efforts of will that produce these choices. We\ngenerally are responsible for these efforts, he maintains, because\nthey are influenced by character and motives resulting from our prior\nfree choices, and because we generally endorse the outcome of such an\neffort when it succeeds\u2014the resulting choice. The second of\nthese observations seems not to the point, since one\u2019s\nresponsibility for an action cannot depend on whether, subsequent to\nthat action, one endorses one of its results. The first observation\nraises a regress problem: what about an agent\u2019s earliest SFWs,\nin which case no prior free choices have influenced the efforts of\nwill preceding the SFWs? Kane says that we are responsible for the\nefforts in these cases as well. But aside from appealing to our\nendorsement of the resulting choices, he does not explain how this can\nbe so.\n\nKane\u2019s appeal to indeterminate efforts of will, and the appeal\nthereby to indeterminism, do not appear to help meet the luck\nobjection. (Neither does it appear that help comes from his\nrequirement that, in making a choice that is an SFW, the agent comes\nto want more to act on the reason for which she makes that choice.\nFor, on Kane\u2019s view, this wanting more is brought about by the\nchoice. And if an event-causal view is on the right track, the\nagent\u2019s control over the making of the choice is a matter of the\nproduction of the choice, not of what the choice produces.) A simpler\ncentered incompatibilist account, then, may fare just as well against\nthe argument from luck.\n3. Agent-Causal Theories\n\nA number of incompatibilists have maintained that a free decision (or\nsome event internal to such a decision) must be caused by the agent,\nand it must not be the case that either what the agent causes or the\nagent\u2019s causing that event is causally determined by prior\nevents. On what are called agent-causal views, causation by an agent\nis held not to consist in causation by events (such as the\nagent\u2019s recognizing certain reasons). An agent, it is said, is a\npersisting substance; causation by an agent is causation by such a\nsubstance. Since a substance is not the kind of thing that can itself\nbe an effect (though various events involving it can be), on these\naccounts an agent is in a strict and literal sense an originator of\nher free decisions, an uncaused cause of them. This combination of\nindeterminism and origination is thought to capture best the idea\nthat, when we act freely, a plurality of alternatives is open to us\nand we determine, ourselves, which of these we pursue, and to secure\nthe kind of freedom needed for moral responsibility.\n\nGeorge Berkeley (1710 [1998]) and Thomas Reid (1788 [1969]) held views\nof this type in the early modern period. In recent years, agent-causal\naccounts have been advanced by Roderick Chisholm (1966, 1971, 1976a,\n1976b, and 1978), Randolph Clarke (1993 and 1996), Alan Donagan\n(1987), Meghan Griffith (2005, 2007, and 2010), Jonathan Jacobs and\nTimothy O\u2019Connor (2013), T. J. Mawson (2011), Timothy\nO\u2019Connor (1995, 1996, 2000a, 2000b, 2002, 2005, 2009a and\n2009b), William Rowe (1991, 2000, 2003, and 2006), Helen Steward\n(2012), Richard Taylor (1966 and 1992), John Thorp (1980), and Michael\nZimmerman (1984). Derk Pereboom (2001, 2004, 2007, and 2014) has\nargued that we can have free will only if we are agent-causes, but\nthat the evidence is against the existence of agent causation.\n\nSetting aside (for the moment) the question of evidence, agent-causal\ntheories face three main objections. One concerns acting freely for a\nreason and the reason-explanation of free actions; the second is the\nproblem of luck; the last concerns the intelligibility of the notion\nof agent causation and whether causation by an agent (where this is\nunderstood to be causation by a substance) is possible.\n3.1 Agent Causation and Reason-Explanation\n\nWe saw in section 1.2 that difficulties confront accounts of acting\nfor a reason and of reason-explanation that do not appeal to the\ncausation of action by the agent\u2019s recognizing certain reasons.\nStandard agent-causal views deny that events such as the agent\u2019s\nrecognizing certain reasons cause any free action (or whatever event\nthe agent directly causes when she acts freely). Such views must,\nthen, offer some alternative account of the phenomenon in\nquestion.\n\nThe most sophisticated such proposal is that advanced by Timothy\nO\u2019Connor (2000b: ch. 5). At the core of the proposal is an\naccount of the reason-explanation of free decisions. As O\u2019Connor\nsees it, agents do not cause free decisions; rather, a free decision\nis a causally complex event, consisting of the agent\u2019s causing\nher coming to have a certain intention. (Such a causally complex event\nis, in turn, a component of any free overt action, such as one\u2019s\nfreely raising one\u2019s arm.) Suppose, then, that someone freely\ndecides to A right now. The decision can be explained by citing an\nantecedent desire, O\u2019Connor maintains, if\n\n\n(a) prior to making that decision, the agent had the desire in\nquestion and believed that A-ing would satisfy (or contribute\nto satisfying) that desire; and\n\n(b) the intention to A that the agent comes to have in making\nthe decision is caused by the agent and is an intention to A\nhere and now in order to satisfy the desire in question (adapted from\nO\u2019Connor 2000b: 86).\n\n\nOne objection to such a view (raised by Feldman and Buckareff [2003])\nis that it appeals to something that is not necessary for the truth of\nthe kind of explanation we are considering. One can decide on the\nbasis of a certain desire, and citing that desire can yield a true\nreason-explanation of one\u2019s decision, even if the intention that\none forms in deciding is not a second-order attitude, an attitude that\nis about (in part) another of one\u2019s attitudes (a certain\ndesire). O\u2019Connor might accept this point and propose that we\nwill have a true reason-explanation as well if the intention that is\nacquired represents, not the desire in question, but rather the object\nof that desire. The proposal would then resemble McCann\u2019s\naccount of reason-explanation. However, it might be objected that one\ncan decide on the basis of a desire even if the intention that one\nforms in making that decision does not represent, in its content, the\nobject of that desire. As we observed in examining McCann\u2019s\nview, an agent sometimes makes a decision for many reasons, and it is\nimplausible that each and every one of the reasons for which a\ndecision is made must enter into the content of that decision.\n\nA further objection is that O\u2019Connor\u2019s account of\nreason-explanation commits him to an implausible view of the\nexplanation of causally complex events. As he has it, whether an\nexplanation citing a state of an agent truly explains the\nagent\u2019s causing her acquisition of a certain intention depends\ncrucially on whether the effect component of this causally complex\nevent has a certain feature, and the truth of the explanation does not\nrequire that the agent\u2019s being in the cited state cause either\nthe causally complex event, the cause component of that event, or the\neffect component of that event. But we do not find this sort of thing\nto be so in cases of any other kinds of causally complex event.\n\nConsider a case that is in important respects analogous to what we are\nexamining here. Suppose that a flash of lightning has caused a brush\nfire. A drought, let us say, had left the brush dry, and had this not\nbeen so, the lightning flash would not have caused the fire, or at\nleast would have been less likely to do so. Now suppose that the\ndryness of the brush is cited as an explanation of the flash\u2019s\ncausing the fire. Does the truth of the proffered explanation hinge on\nwhether the fire has a certain feature, and can the explanation be\ntrue even if the brush\u2019s being dry did not cause either the\nflash, the fire, or the flash\u2019s causing the fire? Apparently\nnot.\n\nThe difficulty here stems from O\u2019Connor\u2019s requirement,\nlike that imposed by most proponents of agent-causal views, that only\nthe agent cause what is directly agent-caused in a free action. On an\nalternative account, it is required that a free action be caused by\nthe agent and nondeterministically caused by certain agent-involving\nevents, such as the agent\u2019s recognizing certain reasons and\nhaving a certain intention. Such a view, it is said, can provide the\nsame accounts of acting for a reason and of reason-explanation as can\nevent-causal theories of free will. And since the event causation that\nis posited is required to be nondeterministic, the view secures the\nopenness of alternatives, even on the assumption that this openness is\nincompatible with determinism. Finally, the required agent causation\nitself is still held to be distinct from causation by any events, and\nso this view may be said to secure the origination of free actions\nthat seemed an appealing feature of standard agent-causal accounts\n(Clarke 1993, 1996, 2003b: ch. 8, and 2011; Mawson [2011: ch. 5] and\nSteward [2012: 217\u2013219] also allow that events can play a\n[nondeterministic] causal role in the production of free actions in\nadditional to the causal role played by the agent).\n\nHere is a brief illustration of a freely made decision, as this type\nof view would have it. Suppose that on some occasion a certain\nindividual, Leo, is deliberating about whether to tell the truth or to\nlie. He recognizes reasons favoring each alternative and has an\nintention to make up his mind now. Suppose that there is a nonzero\nprobability that Leo\u2019s recognizing the reasons favoring telling\nthe truth (together with his having the indicated intention) will\nnondeterministically cause his deciding to tell the truth; and suppose\nthat there is, as well, a nonzero probability that his recognizing the\nreasons favoring lying (together with his having the intention) will\ninstead nondeterministically cause his deciding to lie. Then, given\nall prior conditions, it is open to Leo to make the former decision\nand open to him to make the latter one instead. Now suppose that, as a\nmatter of nomological necessity, in the circumstances, whichever of\nthe open decisions Leo makes, that decision will be made, and it will\nbe caused by his recognizing the reasons that favor it, only if\nLeo\u2014the agent\u2014causes that decision. Finally, suppose that,\nin fact, Leo decides to tell the truth. His decision is caused by him,\nand it is nondeterministically caused by his recognizing reasons\nfavoring the action decided upon (and his having the intention to make\nup his mind). He would make that decision only if he caused it. On\nthis view, Leo\u2019s exercising control over which decision he\nmakes\u2014his determining which of the open decisions he\nmakes\u2014consists in his decision\u2019s being (appropriately)\ncaused by him and by these mental events involving him.\n\nIt is a matter of some dispute whether event causation and agent\ncausation can be combined in this fashion and, if they can be, whether\nthe combination would provide what incompatibilists think necessary\nfor free will. (For discussion of these points, see Clarke 2003b:\n144\u201348 and 2011; Ginet 2002; O\u2019Connor 2000b: 76\u201370;\nand O\u2019Connor and Churchill 2004.)\n3.2 Luck, Again\n\nWhile the appeal to agent causation might be thought to solve the\nproblem of luck, the objection has been raised that in fact it does\nnot help at all (Haji 2004; Mele 2005 and 2006: ch. 3; van Inwagen\n1983: 145 and 2000). Consider Leo. At a certain moment he agent-causes\na decision to tell the truth, and until he does there remains a chance\nthat he will instead, at that moment, agent-cause a decision to lie.\nThere is, then, a possible world that is exactly like the actual world\nup until the time at which Leo agent-causes his decision but in which,\nat that moment, Leo agent-causes a decision to lie. Nothing about the\nworld prior to the moment of the agent-causing accounts for the\ndifference between Leo\u2019s causing one decision and his causing\nthe other. This difference, then, is just a matter of luck. And if\nthis difference is just a matter of luck, Leo cannot be responsible\nfor his decision.\n\nIf in fact Leo\u2019s causing his decision constitutes his exercising\nfree will, then the difference between his causing a decision to tell\nthe truth and his causing a decision to lie is not just a matter of\nluck; it is a matter of how Leo exercises his free will. But what can\nbe said to support the claim that an agent\u2019s causing a decision\nis his exercising free will? Many hold that when an agent exercises\nfree will, it is up to the agent herself whether she does one thing or\nanother. A plurality of alternatives is open to the person, and the\nperson herself determines which alternative she pursues. It is also\nsaid that when an agent exercises free will, she is an ultimate source\nor origin of her action. An agent-causal account may be said to nicely\nrealize these conceptions of free will. On the assumption that\nincompatibilism is correct, the account\u2019s requirement of\nindeterminism is needed to secure the openness of alternatives. And\nits requirement of agent causation may be thought to secure the\nagent\u2019s determining, herself, which alternative she pursues, as\nwell as her originating her action. (Unlike what we have with any\nevent-causal view, with an agent-causal account, the agent is quite\nliterally an ultimate source or origin of her action.) If the account\nsatisfactorily realizes these conceptions of free will, then it may be\ncredibly claimed that the difference in question between worlds is a\nmatter of Leo\u2019s exercising his free will differently.\n3.3 Causation by a Substance\n\nAll theorists who accept a causal construal of agents\u2019 control\nover what they do\u2014and this includes most compatibilists as well\nas many incompatibilists\u2014can accept that agents cause their free\nactions (or events internal to these actions). After all, we accept\nthat the sun causes sunburn and that, when water dissolves sugar, it\ncauses the sugar to dissolve. However, it is widely thought that\ncausation by such things is reducible to, or consists wholly in,\ncausation by states of these things or events involving them, and this\nis precisely what is denied with respect to the agent causation that\nis invoked by agent-causal theories of free will. The denial raises\nthe question whether any intelligible account of agent causation can\nbe given. Even some proponents of agent-causal views (e.g., Taylor\n1992: 53) seem doubtful about this, declaring agent causation to be\nstrange or even mysterious.\n\nSuch doubts may be viewed in light of the widely held presumption\nthat, free will (or perhaps, more broadly, purposive agency) aside,\ncausation throughout nature is, fundamentally, causation by events or\nstates. Until recently, even most proponents of agent-causal theories\nhave accepted this view. And with this view granted, an appeal to\nagent causation in a theory of free will may strike us an implausible\nclaim of metaphysical exceptionalism.\n\nIn the last couple of decades, however, a growing number of\nphilosophers have argued that causation by substances is ontologically\nfundamental. Some (e.g., Jacobs and O\u2019Connor 2013; Lowe 2008:\n143\u201346; O\u2019Connor 2014; and Swinburne 1997 and 2006) hold that,\nfundamentally, all causation is substance causation. Others (e.g.,\nAlvarez and Hyman 1998; Hyman 2015: 40\u201342; Mayr 2011: 229\u201330; and\nSteward 2012: 207\u201316) advance causal pluralism, on which entities of a\nvariety of different categories\u2014the list includes substances,\nevents, properties, features, aspects, and facts\u2014cause things,\nand causation by each of these kinds of thing is equally fundamental.\nThe pluralist picture is not one of competition but of\ninterdependence; as it may be put, events cause things only when the\nsubstances in which these events are changes cause those things, and\nsubstances cause things only when changes in those substances cause\nthose things. (Hyman [2015: 41] suggests a similar view.)\n\nOften such views are advanced on grounds that are entirely independent\nof free will or purposive agency, having to do with the nature of\ncausation and causal powers generally. Substance causation that is\nontologically fundamental is held to be pervasive, constituting the\nactivity of substances animate and inanimate, macro and micro.\nRejection of the view that causation by events or states is uniquely\nfundamental often stems from a turn away from of a broadly Humean\naccount of causation toward a neo-Aristotelian view, one that takes\ncausal powers to be irreducible features of the world.\n\nIn the context of a view of this kind, an appeal to causation by\nagents that is ontologically fundamental is no claim of metaphysical\nexceptionalism. Further, on a causal pluralist view, an agent-causal\ntheorist can help herself to an understanding of acting for a reason\nin terms of causation by one\u2019s recognition of reasons. For it\nmay be said that a free action is caused by the agent and caused by\ncertain states of the agent, with causation by each of these things\ninterdependent and equally fundamental. The verdict on such a view\nhinges on the tenability of its general account of causation.\n\nAt the same time, if the activity of every substance\u2014an\nelectron, an oak tree\u2014consists in fundamental substance\ncausation, the worry arises whether agent causation can provide what\nfree-will theorists who appeal to it have thought it could provide:\norigination, and the agent\u2019s determining, herself, which of\nseveral open alternatives she pursues. After all, on the view in\nquestion, an electron, too, may be an undetermined determinant of what\nit does. Perhaps, in the end, the difference between the electron and\nthe free agent isn\u2019t a matter of the agent being the ultimate\nsource of her behavior, but rather in the purposiveness involved in\nagent causation.\n4. The Evidence\n\nOur discussion of incompatibilist theories of free will has focused so\nfar on whether they provide an adequate account of what free will\nwould be if it exists. However, even if one or another of these views\nis theoretically satisfactory in this regard, the question remains\nwhether there is any evidence that what the theory says is required\nfor free will actually exists.\n\nIncompatibilist accounts require, first, that determinism be false.\nBut more than this, they require that there be indeterminism of a\ncertain sort (e.g., with some events entirely uncaused, or\nnondeterministically caused, or caused by agents and not\ndeterministically caused by events) and that this indeterminism be\nlocated in specific places (generally, at the time of the occurrence\nof decisions and other basic actions). What is our evidence that these\nrequirements are satisfied?\n\nThe scientific evidence for quantum mechanics is sometimes said to\nshow that determinism is false. Quantum theory is indeed very well\nconfirmed. However, there is nothing approaching a consensus on how to\ninterpret it. Indeterministic as well as deterministic interpretations\nhave been developed, but it is far from clear whether any of the\nexisting interpretations is correct. (For a more in depth discussion\nof rival interpretations of quantum mechanics see section 4.4 of the\nDeterminism entry.) Perhaps the best that can be said here is that\nthere is currently no good evidence that determinism is true.\n\nThe scientific evidence is even less decisive with respect to whether\nthere is the kind of indeterminism located in exactly the places\nrequired by typical incompatibilists. Unless there is a complete\nindependence of mental events from physical events, then even for free\ndecisions there has to be indeterminism of a specific sort at specific\njunctures in certain brain processes. There are some interesting\nspeculations in the works of some incompatibilists about how this\nmight be so (see, e.g., Kane 1996b: 128\u201330, 137\u201342, and\nthe sources cited there), but our current understanding of the brain\ngives us little evidence one way or the other about whether it is in\nfact so.\n\nSome noncausal theories of free will maintain that for us to act\nfreely our actions must be uncaused. However, we seem to have little\nevidence that this (alleged) requirement is ever met. We do, however,\nhave evidence that it often isn\u2019t met, as a compelling case can\nbe made that many of our everyday actions have causes (Capes 2017).\nConsider an ordinary, everyday action: Tony goes to the store to buy\nsome chocolate cake. Why did he do so? In part because his wife asked\nhim to, and the \u2018because\u2019 here is arguably causal. That\nthe request is a cause of Tony\u2019s action is suggested by the\npresence of several causal markers, things that indicate a causal\nconnection between two states or events. For instance, effects often\n(though not always) counterfactually depend on their causes,\nand Tony\u2019s action counterfactually depends on his\nwife\u2019s request; had she not asked him to go to the store and get\ncake, he wouldn\u2019t have done so. Tony\u2019s action also\ncounterfactually varies with the content of his wife\u2019s\nrequest; had she asked for carrot cake instead of chocolate, he would\nhave gotten carrot cake instead. His wife\u2019s request raised\nthe probability (even if it didn\u2019t ensure) that he would go\nto the store and buy some cake, it helps explain why he went\nto the store and got what he got, and it was a means to the\nend of getting Tony to go to the store. The joint presence of\nthese causal markers strongly suggests that Tony\u2019s wife\u2019s\nrequest that he go to the store and get some cake is a cause of his\ndoing so. Note, moreover, that Tony\u2019s action isn\u2019t special\nin this regard. Similar claims can be made about many of our everday\nbehaviors. If so, and if an action must be uncaused in order to be\nfree, then we have reason to suppose that we rarely, if ever, act\nfreely.\n\nWhat about agent causation? It is sometimes argued that agent\ncausation must be anomic, not subject to any laws of nature, and that\non our best evidence this requirement is not met (Pereboom 2001: ch. 3\nand 2014: 65\u201369). However, the claim that free will requires such\nlawlessness is contested (Clarke 2010).\n\nSome incompatibilists (e.g., Campbell 1957: 168\u201370 and\nO\u2019Connor 1995: 196\u201397) claim that our experience when we\nmake decisions and act constitutes evidence that there is\nindeterminism of the required sort in the required place. There are\nvarious ways to develop this claim. A strong version has it that our\nexperience of our own agency represents our actions as being produced\nin just the way that one or another incompatibilist account says they\nmust be if we are to have free will. (For an objection to this claim,\nsee Mele 1995: 135\u201337). A weaker version of the claim is that we\nexperience some of our actions as free (even if that experience\ndoesn\u2019t represent our actions as being uncaused or\nnon-deterministically caused or agent caused) and then infer from this\nexperience, together with the assumption that free will requires\nindeterminism of the relevant sort, that the right sort of\nindeterminism obtains. However, both versions of the claim are open to\nthe following objection. If things are to be the way they are said to\nbe by some incompatibilist account, then the laws of nature\u2014laws\nof physics, chemistry, and biology\u2014must be a certain way. (This\nis so for overt, bodily actions regardless of the relation between\nmind and body, and it is so for decisions and other mental actions\nbarring a complete independence of mental events from physical,\nchemical, and biological events.) And many find it incredible that how\nthings seem to us when we act gives us insight into the laws of\nnature.\n\nWhether they should, though, is a matter of controversy. Suppose one\nexperiences oneself falling. Surely this imposes some limits on how\nthe laws of nature could be. Perhaps there must be something like a\nlaw of gravity in order for this experience to be veridical. Or, more\nminimally, one can at least infer from the experience of falling that\nthe laws of nature don\u2019t preclude falling. So, there is no\ngeneral problem with inferring facts about the laws of nature from\none\u2019s own experiences. The question, then, is whether there is\nsome special problem with inferring from our experience of our own\nagency that the incompatibilist requirements are met.\n\nSome incompatibilists (e.g., van Inwagen 1983: 204\u201313) hold\nthat, although we lack good empirical or experiential evidence that we\nhave free will, we nevertheless have good moral reason to believe that\nwe have it. The claim is that we have good reason to believe that we\nare sometimes morally responsible for our behavior and that moral\nresponsibility requires free will. Together, these claims give us good\nreason to suppose that we sometimes have free will. However, absent\nsolid evidence for the indeterminism that incompatibilists say is\nrequired for free will, if we justifiably believe that responsibility\nrequires free will and that free will requires indeterminism, it seems\nto some that, rather than concluding that we have free will, we should\ninstead withhold judgment on whether we are ever morally responsible\nfor anything.\n\nIf an incompatibilist theory of free will is correct, it thus appears\nto be an open question whether the requirements for free will\nspecified by the theory are ever satisfied, and thus an open question\nas well whether anyone ever has free will.\n",
