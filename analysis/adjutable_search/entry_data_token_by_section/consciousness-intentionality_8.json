    "main_text": "Consciousness in Mind\n9. Why It Matters\n\nConsciousness and intentionality are inherently fascinating. But no\ndoubt part of their interest lies in the sense that understanding them\nis crucial to understanding much else. And an adequate grasp of what\nis at stake in views about them may be lost in the abstract matrix of\npositions generated in this survey (\u201creductive restrictive\nreflexivist\u201d etc.). Perhaps these views will themselves also\nbecome a little clearer if we summarize and make explicit a few of\ntheir connections with the following four broad areas of philosophical\nconcern.\n\nThe nature and boundaries of mind and self\nThe place of consciousness and intentionality in explanation\nForms of knowledge and justification\nKinds and instances of value\n\n\nLet\u2019s take each of these briefly in turn. First: \u201cthe\nnature and boundaries of mind and self\u201d. Here we may be\ninterested in questions about: (a) what distinguishes minded from\nmindless beings; (b) what unifies the domain of the mental; (c) how\nfar beyond the brain of a minded organism its mind (its\nmental content, or its mental states or processes) properly speaking\nextend, and what are their constituents; (d) what\nsorts of non-mental constraints (in constitution or organization)\nlimit the range of minded beings; and finally (e) what constitutes a\nself (e.g., what is required for its existence and continuity, how\nthis relates to the organism, and to its social and natural\nenvironment).\n\nTopics (a) and (c)\u2014what makes a minded being differ from a\nminded one, and what its properly mental content and activity extend\nto encompass\u2014have evident connections with topic (b): the unity\nof the mental. For presumably a minded being will be one whose states\nhave \u201cmental content\u201d and whose activities are properly\nmental or psychological in character; to decide what those contents\nand activities include will be to decide not only what is part of its\nmind, but also what puts something in the domain of the mental at all.\nFurther, insofar as such boundaries of mind also mark\nboundaries of self (or person or psychological\nsubject\u2014however these categories are to be related)\u2014we\nwill find topics (a-c) closely related to topic (e)\u2014regarding\nthe constitution, continuity and situatedness of self.\n\nAs we have seen, disputes over the consciousness-intentionality\nrelationship are strongly tied to all these \u201cboundary\ndrawing\u201d questions. As some rough indication (and reminder) of\nthe connections, we may note, first, that it is difficult to see how a\nunified conception of mind (or of its extent) can be had on strongly\nnon-intentionalist, separatist views, which suggest a deeply\nbifurcated conception of the domain of the mental. Even if one does\nnot embrace separatism, one may wish to draw the boundaries of the\nconscious mind much further \u201cin\u201d than those of\nthe extended mind. Whichever way one goes, questions emerge\nabout where this leaves the self. And turning back to the\nminded vs. mindless question\u2014a rejection of separatism still\nleaves one with the prospect of a division between two rather\ndifferent kinds of mind (conscious and \u201czombie\u201d). Views on\nwhich no being totally lacking in consciousness would have a mind will\navoid such disunity.\n\nQuestions about (d)\u2014the potential constitution and range of\nrealizations of mind\u2014seem to depend partly on one\u2019s\nattitude towards reductive intentionalism. This is readily joined with\nbroadly functionalist or computationalist perspectives friendly to the\nidea that mind is realizable in physically very diverse entities. If\nindeed it is, then a confidence in reductive intentionalism should\ninspire confidence in the wide diversity of constitutions that\nartificial conscious beings can have, and similarly make us more\nconfident of the potential to extend our own conscious existence in\nartifacts transcending our biological limitations. On the other hand,\nif we reject or are skeptical about reductive intentionalism, we lose\ncertain these for such confidence. And if we combine this with the\nidea that the right kind of subjective experience is necessary and\nsufficient for mind, a corresponding biological conservatism\nabout our grounds for attributing mind to highly physically diverse\nentities, and about our own prospects for indefinitely artificially\nextended futures, may seem more reasonable.\n\nBut these statements need qualification. For one thing, once the\ndetails of an acceptable reductive intentionalism about consciousness\nemerge, it could turn out that\u2014as a matter of natural\nfact\u2014something very like the biological organization found in\nourselves and other animals is needed for its realization, so it could\nturn out that consciousness is not as independent of neurophysiology\nas functionalist theories often suggest (consider Prinz\u2019s 2012\n\u201cneurofunctionalism\u201d). On the other hand, one could reject\nreductionism of any sort about consciousness, while still arguing on\nindependent grounds (like Chalmers 1996) that, as a matter of natural\n(though not metaphysical) necessity, the realization of consciousness\nis very loosely physically constrained. And then there are panpsychist\nviews to consider (Strawson 2006, Goff 2017). If there is no genuinely\nnon-mental, or at least non-phenomenal, reality to be found even in\nparticle physics, then the whole \u201cdiversity of\nrealization\u201d question will have to reconfigured. Perhaps the\nquestion then will be something like: which mental or experiential\nproperties can emerge from which others, and how?\n\nFrom this sketch, we can see something of how \u201cnature and\nboundaries of mind and self\u201d questions associated with earlier\ncanvassed issues about consciousness and intentionality gain\nsignificant interest from concerns about what (if anything)\nunifies the field of study that we label \u201cthe\nmind\u201d\u2014the domain of the \u201cmental\u201d or\n\u201cpsychological\u201d\u2014and about how we should regard the\nprospects for engineering new minds or radical\nextensions of our own.\n\nBut to limit ourselves to these remarks may be to neglect another\n(albeit related) dimension to the interest of these \u201cnature and\nboundaries of mind and self\u201d questions, one perhaps more evident\nin the phenomenological tradition\u2014an inherent interest in\nunderstanding what sort of beings we are. If being minded (or\nbeing capable of understanding) is essential to what we are, the\nquestion of how consciousness figures in mind (or understanding) is\nalso a question of how it figures in our nature. And, if a\nsatisfactory philosophical conception of what sort of beings we are\ninvolves a grasp of how our consciousness reveals to us ourselves and\nthe world, \u201cboundary\u201d questions about its detachability\nfrom our natural and social environments take on an additional\ndimension of interest. To answer them, we need also to address the\nthemes of basic forms and reflexivity. If (as some\nphenomenologists\u2019 views suggest) a pre-predicative,\npre-reflective, practical understanding undetachable from the world is\npart of what makes us what we are, we may need to recognize the\nundetachability of our intentional consciousness. And if the right\nconception of basic forms and reflexivity sees us as essentially\nembodied understanders (as in Merleau-Ponty\u2019s view), we should\nperhaps be suspicious of hopes or plans to keep our minds and leave\nour bodies behind. Further, we need to see\u2014against this\nbackground\u2014what kind of distinctive self-understanding\nreflective self-consciousness makes possible, if this is also\npart of what we are. We need to ask how much this sort of\nself-consciousness can do to detach us from social roles and\npractices, and what room this allows for authenticity, autonomy and\nself-constitution. (This brings us to issues prominent in Heidegger\nand Sartre\u2014but also, in Korsgaard, and in Kantian moral\npsychology generally.)\n\nLet\u2019s now consider the second of the four areas labeled above,\nthe \u201cplace of consciousness and intentionality in\nexplanation.\u201d This is intended to cover questions about\nwhat should be taken (or sought) to explain each of them, as well as\nabout what they should be used to explain. It should be clear now\nroughly how a reductive intentionalist would configure these issues.\nConsciousness is to be explained as a form of intentionality (or\nmental representation) that can be characterized without primitive\nappeal to experiential notions (like \u201clooking\u201d or\n\u201cappearing\u201d)\u2014and the facts about representation can\nin turn be explained without primitive appeal to intentional or\nrepresentational notions. But it would be too simple to think that\nreductive intentionalists in no sense explain intentionality in terms\nof consciousness, or that non-reductive intentionalists in no sense\nexplain consciousness in terms of intentionality. As we have seen, it\nis open to both to say (albeit in very different ways) that what makes\nfor the intentionality of mind is the special kind of representation\nthat consciousness is. And both can say (in a very different ways)\nthat to understand how consciousness figures in mindedness, one must\nunderstand in what ways it is intentional.\n\nWhat we think consciousness can account for would seem to vary with\nhow cognitively rich we think experience is, and whether it figures in\nunderstanding generally, or in grounding a substantial \u201cin\nkind\u201d distinction between the minded and the mindless. (For\ninstance, it is hard to see how a strongly separatist\nposition would allow us to explain very much in terms of\nconsciousness.) And our answers to questions about richness affect our\nview of how consciousness is to be explained. For example, certain\ninclusions and restrictions on what\u2019s in consciousness are\npresupposed in reductive intentionalist theories\u2014to question\ntheir views of how consciousness is limited is to question the\nexplanations of it they offer.\n\nThe second \u201cexplanation\u201d category also encompasses\nquestions about how to see non-mental nature explaining mind.\nPhysicalism generally seems committed to saying the former strongly\nnecessitates the latter\u2014and does not merely guarantee it in\nvirtue of contingent laws. Typically this claim has been motivated by\nthe worry that anything less than strong (\u201cmetaphysical\u201d)\nnecessities would leave mind a superfluous add-on, disturbingly\nineffectual or epiphenomenal; our minds would not really explain our\nactions and their results. And that it seems would leave us with no\ncoherent conception of our place in the world that we can live with.\nIt is often thought that consciousness is the real sticking point\nhere: that is what makes it hard to secure the strong form of\nnecessitation desired, or to put to explanatory use such necessity as\nwe have grounds to think is there. These difficulties are articulated\nin modal conceivability arguments (Kripke 1972; Chalmers 1996); in\n\u201cknowledge\u201d arguments (Nagel 1976; Jackson 1982); in\narguments for the \u201cexplanatory gap\u201d (Levine 2001); and in\nthe case for a \u201cmysterianism\u201d about how consciousness\narises (McGinn 1991). Controversies about whether we can justify the\nclaim that the right combination of non-mental facts or properties\nmakes it the case that mind must occur, and about whether\nthis affords us explanations of the facts of mind, will take\ndifferent forms, depending on how one conceives of the\nconsciousness-intentionality relationship.\n\nHere again, a separatist position would seem to accord concerns about\nconsciousness the least general import\u2014though one may\n(like Kim 2011) argue that by closing off the prospect of reductive\nintentionalism, separatism would have us resign ourselves to an\nirreducible, epiphenomenal \u201cmental residue\u201d of qualia. But\nif one is an intentionalist, then the problems of consciousness will\nspread to the intentionality of our minds, and will apparently cut\nmore deeply, the richer one takes experience to be in intentionality.\nAnd if one accounts for the minded/mindless difference in terms of\nconsciousness, then whatever metaphysical problem consciousness raises\nwill affect the mind quite generally. Thus the stakes will evidently\nbe higher in deciding whether we can secure the controversial\n\u201cbottom-up\u201d necessitation of consciousness, and whether\nsecuring this could secure, or is needed to secure,\na place for consciousness in nature\u2014either as explanans\nor explanandum. To deny that it is needed is not\nnecessarily to foreswear the goal of scientifically explaining facts\nabout consciousness, or to embrace the supernatural. It is just to\nallow that such principles as we can appeal to in explaining what sort\nof consciousness arises, in what circumstances, are ones we must\nconfess might have been otherwise than they are. (But\u2014why these\nprinciples aren\u2019t in fact otherwise ultimately has no\nexplanation.) The epiphenomenalist worry may then still rear its head:\naren\u2019t physicalist necessities required if experience is itself\nto explain anything that happens in the physical world? One\u2019s\nanswer will depend on just what one thinks generally needs to be the\ncase for what happens in the physical world to receive legitimate\nexplanations (or be produced by causes) that don\u2019t belong to\nphysics.\n\nTurning now to the third category, \u201cforms of knowledge and\njustification\u201d: our questions here concern the epistemic\nsignificance of consciousness. What role does consciousness have\nin knowledge acquisition, in understanding, and in warranting\njudgments? One might argue that it has none (Lee 2014). If we cannot\nrule out the possibility of beings functionally like us (but\nphysically different) that lack consciousness (this kind of\n\u201czombie\u201d), we should arguably admit that such zombie\ncounterparts would have minds, and then: that the consciousness-free\nepistemology accounting for their knowledge would have all that\nany epistemology really needs. In response to this, one could\nargue (as in Section 8) that nothing that utterly lacked consciousness\nwould really understand anything or have a mind\u2014so there is no\n\u201czombie epistemology\u201d. Alternatively (or in addition) one\ncould argue that we shouldn\u2019t assume the epistemology of\nconscious beings like ourselves would be no different than the\nepistemology (assuming there is one) applicable to such hypothetical\nbeings.\n\nIf pre-emptive challenges to the epistemic significance of\nconsciousness can be met, other issues arise to which the\nconsciousness-intentionality relationship appear relevant. To take\nfirst the question of our knowledge of our surroundings: we want to\nsay sense perception plays a role in this. But what role is played by\nsensory consciousness in our account would seem to depend on\nhow we see that as related to intentionality. As in the other cases,\nthe potential importance of consciousness seems diminished by\nseparatism. Thus we have the Davidsonian view that suggests subjective\nexperience, consisting just in sensations, can play only a causal, and\nno justificatory role in support of perceptual judgments (Davidson\n1982, 1986). Against this, we have the McDowellian argument in favor\nof conceptual content for sensory experience: only if it is this\nrichly cognitive can it play the epistemic role we rightly assume it\ndoes (McDowell 1994). But this suggests difficult questions (of the\nsort canvassed in Section 5) about how to justify an assessment of the\nrichness of phenomenal character.\n\nDifferent views on the theme of basic forms of intentionality will\nface different challenges in accounting for the sources of our\nknowledge, or of warrant for our mundane beliefs about the things we\nfind around us. Roughly, it might seem that in certain respects, the\nstory of justification will be easier, the more the intentionality of\nsensory experience is assimilated to that of full-blown\nconcept-applying judgment or belief\u2014inasmuch as it seems\nunmysterious how beliefs justify beliefs. On the other hand, going\nvery far in that direction can bring puzzles of its own. It seems that\nsense experience should be of the right sort to enable us to\nacquire concepts (which assumes we don\u2019t\nalready have them), and to support our\napplying concepts to things (which assumes we haven\u2019t\nalready done so). But it may seem harder to maintain these\nassumptions, if we make sensory experience itself a kind of judgment\nor belief (see the discussion in Siegel and Silins 2015).\n\nTreatments of detachability may also have epistemic\nimplications. Some (e.g., John Campbell 2002) have argued that we\ncan\u2019t do justice to the role of sense experience in providing\nknowledge of the particulars in our surroundings, unless we regard the\nexperience (and even its subjective character) as essentially\n\u201cobject-dependent\u201d. On the other hand, one may wonder if\none can do justice to the subjectivity of experience, its perspectival\nand error-prone nature, while maintaining some form of\nobject-dependence. Consideration of Husserl\u2019s and\nMerleau-Ponty\u2019s views on perceptual experience, and discussion\nof contemporary disjunctivism\u2019s treatment of illusion and\nhallucination, engages with this aspect of the epistemic significance\nof consciousness.\n\nHow one sees the relationship of consciousness to intentionality will\nalso shape what account one can give of \u201cintrospective\u201d\nself-knowledge. That is, it will bear on our accounts of how we know\nor have warrant for judgments about our own states of mind. One will\nlikely think the difference between what is conscious and what\nisn\u2019t makes some difference to what one can know of one\u2019s\nown mind in a distinctively first-person way. Roughly, what\u2019s\nconscious would seem to be more directly knowable introspectively. But\nholding either a separatist or strongly restrictivist view would\nappear to limit the role consciousness can play in one\u2019s account\nof self-knowledge. For example, Carruthers\u2019 view of phenomenal\nconsciousness restricts it almost entirely to nonconceptual sensory\nstates and patterns of imagery, and correspondingly limits\ndistinctively first-personal self-knowledge: beyond these confines of\nconsciousness, your epistemic relation to your mental life\u2014to\nhow and what you are thinking, for example\u2014is held to be\nbasically the same as it is to another\u2019s (Carruthers 2011).\nAlternatively, one might think that your knowledge of your own\nthoughts is also fundamentally and distinctively\nfirst-personal\u2014but in a very different (perhaps\n\u201crationalist\u201d) way than knowledge of your own sense\nexperience and imagery: knowing one\u2019s own mind comes in two\nquite different varieties (Moran 2001; Boyle 2009). However, assuming\nan inclusive conception of experience, it will be more open to\nmaintain that consciousness accounts in a partly similar way for\nself-knowledge, regardless of whether it is one\u2019s own\nsensing or thinking that is known.\n\nClearly too, understanding the relationship of consciousness to\nself-consciousness with respect to the reflexivity theme will play an\nimportant role in determining what to say about self-knowledge. For\ninstance, proponents of higher-order thought or inner sense theories\nof consciousness will have different strategies available in\naccounting for the special self-knowledge consciousness affords (and\nface different challenges) than those who reject these accounts. For\nexample, obviously, one cannot offer an inner sense account of\nself-knowledge if one thinks there is no inner sense. And if one does\nbelieve in inner sense, special questions arise about how to account\nfor the possibility of introspective error and self-correction. Also,\neven if one distinguishes consciousness from state self-consciousness,\none may think that consciousness makes possible a form of\nself-consciousness\u2014a first-person form of reflection\u2014with\ndistinctive epistemic properties (as, e.g., in Gertler 2012a; Siewert\n2012). We might note further that having a rich conception of\nconsciousness, and putting this to work in a unified and comprehensive\naccount of introspective self-knowledge fits naturally into an\n\u201cinternalist\u201d view of justification: if, as an\ninternalist, you think that what justifies your judgments needs to be\nappropriately available to you, a consciousness-based conception of\nself-knowledge may seem tailor-made to tell us what \u201cappropriate\navailability\u201d comes to here. (See Smithies 2019.)\n\nFinally, a few words about the fourth topic mentioned above: how our\nviews of consciousness and intentionality might affect the kind of\nvalue we recognize. What kind of value do we see in\nexperience? It will not be unusual to think it has for us a\nnon-instrumental (and in that sense \u201cintrinsic\u201d) value.\nOne way to make this explicit: consider what goods you think your own\nexperience brings you, which you could conceive of getting without\nit\u2014in an experience-less, \u201czombified\u201d state. Would\nyou still much rather have experience than not, even on the condition\nthat without it, all the goods you think it provides that\ncould be had without it, were in fact available? An answer\n\u201cyes\u201d seems to indicate you accord conscious experiences\nsome kind of non-instrumental value. Another question: do you think\nsomething very bad has happened if your own or another person\u2019s\nexistence is terminated, even if you (or they) are replaced with an\nexact duplicate? If you say yes, does the badness of such an\nextinction-plus-replacement scenario remain, presuming that prior to\nit, the person\u2019s consciousness has already been\ntotally and permanently extinguished? Suppose you say\nno\u2014the truly terrible part to this story comes at the stage\nwhere one is utterly and forever \u201czombified\u201d; after\nthat, nothing of significant non-instrumental value remains\nto be destroyed by the envisaged replacement. This suggests that for\nyou the kind of irreplaceable value you accord particular\npersons is essentially tied to the non-instrumental value experience\nhas for you (Siewert 1998, 2014, 2021). Intuitive responses to such\nscenarios appear to bring to the surface convictions about the kind of\nnon-instrumental value consciousness has (and conscious beings have)\nfor us. But how should we relate this to our views about consciousness\nand intentionality?\n\nIt seems open still to hold to the value-revealing responses just\nimagined, even if one divorces consciousness from intentionality, or\nmaintains that experience lacks the kind of cognitive richness\ninvolved in conceptual understanding. However, it would then appear\nthat the value you accord consciousness would be importantly detached\nfrom whatever non-instrumental value you accord the exercise of\nunderstanding. And questions would arise about how, on such a view,\nthere could be a valuable pleasure in that exercise, and\nabout how one could continue to tie the irreplaceable value of\npersons to consciousness. In general, giving high intrinsic\nvalue to consciousness and reserving the irreplaceable value of\npersons for conscious beings will likely seem easier, the richer one\ntakes experience to be.\n\nBut even then we may wonder whether, if consciousness\u2014no matter\nhow rich\u2014is strictly inessential to mindedness, we\nshould really care about it so much. On the view proposed by Neil Levy\n(2014), it is assumed that zombies could have minds possessed of\nrational understanding, desires and interests\u2014and so their\nwell-being would count in considerations of value no less or\ndifferently than that of conscious beings. Thus he maintains (by a\nreasoning that parallels Lee\u2019s epistemological deflation of\nconsciousness): even in our own case (phenomenal) consciousness is\nincidental to value. But again, one may contest the assumption of\nzombie minds. And even if one does not, it may well seem that, when it\ncomes to entities that can have no subjective experience of\nfrustration or satisfaction, it should not much matter to us whether\nthey get what they are alleged to want, except insofar as we happen\nindependently to want it ourselves.\n\nThere is surely much more to say about how views of the\nconsciousness-intentionality relationship bear on large questions\nabout mind, self, explanation, knowledge and value. But what has just\nbeen said hopefully brings out some prominent features of the\nphilosophical landscape.\n",
