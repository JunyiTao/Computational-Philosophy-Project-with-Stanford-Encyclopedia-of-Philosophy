    "preamble": "\n\nThe algebra of logic, as an explicit algebraic\nsystem showing the underlying mathematical structure of logic, was\nintroduced by George Boole (1815\u20131864) in his book The\nMathematical Analysis of Logic (1847). It is therefore to be\ndistinguished from the more general approach of algebraic\nlogic.  The methodology initiated by Boole was successfully\ncontinued in the 19th century in the work of William\nStanley Jevons (1835\u20131882), Charles Sanders Peirce\n(1839\u20131914), Ernst Schr\u00f6der (1841\u20131902), among many\nothers, thereby establishing a tradition in (mathematical) logic. From\nBoole\u2019s first book until the influence after WWI of the monumental\nwork Principia Mathematica (1910\u20131913) by Alfred North\nWhitehead (1861\u20131947) and Bertrand Russell (1872\u20131970),\nversions of the algebra of logic were the most developed form of\nmathematical logic above all as presented in Schr\u00f6der\u2019s three\nvolumes Vorlesungen \u00fcber die Algebra der Logik\n(1890\u20131905). Furthermore, this tradition motivated the\ninvestigations of Leopold L\u00f6wenheim (1878\u20131957) that\neventually gave rise to model theory. In addition, in 1941, Alfred\nTarski (1901\u20131983) in his paper \u201cOn the calculus of\nrelations\u201d returned to Peirce\u2019s relation algebra as presented in\nSchr\u00f6der\u2019s Algebra der Logik. The tradition of the\nalgebra of logic played a key role in the notion of Logic as\nCalculus as opposed to the notion of Logic as Universal\nLanguage. Beyond Tarski\u2019s algebra of relations, the influence of\nthe algebraic tradition in logic can be found in other mathematical\ntheories, such as category theory. However this influence lies outside\nthe scope of this entry, which is divided into 10 sections.\n",

    "main_text": "\n1. Introduction\n\nBoole\u2019s The Mathematical Analysis of Logic presents many\ninteresting logic novelties: It was the beginning of\nnineteenth-century mathematization of logic and provided an\nalgorithmic alternative (via a slight modification of\nordinary algebra) to the catalog approach used in traditional\nlogic (even if reduction procedures were developed in the latter).\nInstead of a list of valid forms of argument, the validity of\narguments were determined on the basis of general principles and\nrules. Furthermore, it provided an effective method for proving\nlogical laws on the basis of a system of postulates. As Boole wrote\nlater, it was a proper \u201cscience of reasoning\u201d, and not a\n\u201cmnemonic art\u201d like traditional Syllogistics (Boole 1997:\n136).  Three-quarters of the way through this book, after finishing\nhis discussion of syllogistic logic, Boole started to develop the\ngeneral tools that would be used in his Laws of Thought\n(1854) to greatly extend traditional logic by permitting an argument\nto have many premises and to involve many classes. To handle the\ninfinitely many possible logical arguments of this expanded logic, he\npresented theorems that provided key tools for an algorithmic analysis\n(a catalog was no longer feasible).\n\nBoole\u2019s ideas were conceived independently of earlier anticipations,\nlike those developed by G.W. Leibniz. They emerged from the particular\ncontexts of English mathematics (see Peckhaus 2009). According to\nV\u00edctor S\u00e1nchez Valencia, the tradition that originated\nwith Boole came to be known as the algebra of logic since the\npublication in 1879 of Principles of the Algebra of Logic by\nAlexander MacFarlane (see S\u00e1nchez Valencia 2004: 389).\nMacFarlane considered \u201cthe analytical method of reasoning about\nQuality proposed by Boole\u201d as an algebra (see MacFarlane 1879:\n3).\n\nThis approach differs from what is usually called algebraic\nlogic; though there is some overlap, the historical development\nof the two areas are different. Algebraic logic is understood as:\n\n\na style [of logic] in which concepts and relations\nare expressed by mathematical symbols [\\(\\ldots\\)] so that\nmathematical techniques can be applied. Here mathematics shall mean\nmostly algebra, i.e., the part of mathematics concerned with finitary\noperations on some set. (Hailperin 2004: 323)\n\n\nAlgebraic logic can be already found in the work of Leibniz, Jacob\nBernoulli and other modern thinkers, and it undoubtedly constitutes an\nimportant antecedent of Boole\u2019s approach. In a broader perspective,\nboth are part of the tradition of symbolic knowledge in the\nformal sciences, as first conceived by Leibniz (see Esquisabel 2012).\nThis idea of algebraic logic was continued to some extent in the\nFrench Enlightenment in the work of Condillac and Condorcet (see\nGrattan-Guinness 2000: 14 ff.)\n\nBoole\u2019s methodology for dealing with logical problems can be described\nas follows:\n\nTranslate the logical data into suitable equations;\nApply algebraic techniques to solve these equations;\nTranslate this solution, if possible, back into the original\nlanguage.\n\n\nIn other words, symbolic formulation of logical problems and solution\nof logical equations constitutes Boole\u2019s method (see S\u00e1nchez\nValencia 2004: 389).\n\nLater, in his Pure Logic from 1864, Jevons changed Boole\u2019s\npartial operation of union of disjoint sets to the modern unrestricted\nunion and eliminated Boole\u2019s questionable use of uninterpretable terms\n(see Jevons 1890). Peirce (1880) eliminated explicitly the\nAristotelian derivation of particular statements from universal\nstatements by giving the modern meaning for \u201cAll \\(A\\) is\n\\(B\\)\u201d. In addition, he extended the algebra of logic for\nclasses to the algebra of logic for binary relations and introduced\ngeneral sums and products to handle quantification. Ernst\nSchr\u00f6der, taking inspiration from previous work by Hermann\n(1809\u20131877) and Robert Grassmann (1815\u20131901) and using the\nframework developed by Peirce, developed and systematized the\n19th Century achievements in the algebra of logic in his\nthree-volume work Vorlesungen \u00fcber die Algebra der Logik\n(1890\u20131910).\n\nThe contributions of Gottlob Frege (1848\u20131925) to logic from the\nperiod 1879\u20131903, based on an axiomatic approach to\nlogic, had very little influence at the time (and the same can be said\nof the diagrammatic systems of C.S. Peirce developed at the\nturn of the century). Whitehead and Russell rejected the algebra of\nlogic approach, with its predominantly equational formulations and\nalgebraic symbolism, in favor of an approach strongly inspired by the\naxiomatic system of Frege, and using the notation developed by\nGiuseppe Peano, namely to use logical connectives, relation symbols\nand quantifiers.\n\nDuring the first two decades of the twentieth century, the algebra of\nlogic was further developed in the works of Platon Sergeevich\nPoretzsky (1846\u20131907), Louis Couturat (1868\u20131914), Leopold\nL\u00f6wenheim (1878\u20131957), and Heinrich Behmann\n(1891\u20131970) (see Styazhkin 1969). In particular, elimination\ntheorems in the algebra of logic influenced decision procedures for\nfragments of first-order and second-order logic (see Mancosu, Zach,\nBadesa 2009).\n\nAfter WWI David Hilbert (1862\u20131943), who had at first adopted\nthe algebraic approach, picked up on the approach of\nPrincipia, and the algebra of logic fell out of favor.\nHowever, in 1941, Tarski treated relation algebras as an equationally\ndefined class. Such a class has many models besides the collection\nof all binary relations on a given universe that was considered\nin the 1800s, just as there are many Boolean algebras besides the\npower set Boolean algebras studied in the 1800s. In the years\n1948\u20131952 Tarski, along with his students Chin and Thompson,\ncreated cylindric algebras as an algebraic logic companion to\nfirst-order logic, and in 1956 Paul Halmos (1916\u20132006)\nintroduced polyadic algebras for the same purpose. As Halmos (1956 b,\nc and d) noted, these new algebraic logics tended to focus on studying\nthe extent to which they captured first-order logic and on their\nuniversal algebraic aspects such as axiomatizations and structure\ntheorems, but offered little insight into the nature of the\nfirst-order logic which inspired their creation.\n2. 1847\u2014The Beginnings of the Modern Versions of the Algebra of Logic\n\nIn late 1847, Boole and Augustus De Morgan (1806\u20131871) each\npublished a book on logic\u2014Boole\u2019s Mathematical Analysis of\nLogic (1847) and De Morgan\u2019s Formal Logic (1847). De\nMorgan\u2019s approach was to dissect every aspect of traditional deductive\nlogic (usually called \u2018Aristotelian logic\u2019) into its\nminutest components, to consider ways to generalize these components,\nand then, in some cases, undertake to build a logical system using\nthese components. Unfortunately, he was never able to incorporate his\nbest ideas into a significant system. His omission of a symbol for\nequality made it impossible to develop an equational algebra of logic.\nIt seems that synthesis was not De Morgan\u2019s strong suit.\n\nDe Morgan\u2019s book of 1847 was part of a revival in logic studies that\noriginated at the beginning of 19th Century with Joseph Diez Gergonne\n(1771\u20131859) in France, and Bernhard Bolzano (1781\u20131848) in\nBohemia, among others. George Bentham and William Hamilton in the\nUnited Kingdom were also part of this revival and their studies\nfocused on the nature of variations of the categorical sentences in\ntraditional syllogistic, including what was called\n\u201cquantification of the predicate\u201d; for example, \u201cAll\n\\(A\\) are some \\(B\\)\u201d or \u201cSome \\(A\\) are all\n\\(B\\)\u201d. It was thought that this problem required an extension\nof the syllogistic logic of Aristotle and that some form of symbolic\nmethod was needed both to handle such statements and provide a\nclassification of their different types (see Heinemann 2015 chapters 2\nand 3). \n\nBoole approached logic from a completely different perspective, namely\nhow to cast Aristotelian logic in the garb of symbolical algebra.\nUsing symbolical algebra was a theme with which he was well-acquainted\nfrom his work in differential equations, and from the various papers\nof his young friend and mentor Duncan Farquharson Gregory\n(1813\u20131844), who made attempts to cast other subjects such as\ngeometry into the language of symbolical algebra. Since the\napplication of symbolical algebra to differential equations had\nproceeded through the introduction of differential operators, it must\nhave been natural for Boole to look for operators that applied in the\narea of Aristotelian logic. He readily came up with the idea of using\n\u201cselection\u201d operators, for example, a selection operator\nfor the color red would select the red members from a class. In his\n1854 book, Boole realized that it was simpler to omit selection\noperators and work directly with classes. (However he kept the\nselection operators to justify his claim that his laws of logic were\nnot ultimately based on observations concerning the use of language,\nbut were actually deeply rooted in the processes of the human mind.)\nFrom now on in this article, when discussing Boole\u2019s 1847 book, the\nselection operators have been replaced with the simpler direct\nformulation using classes.\n\nSince symbolical algebra was just the syntactic side of ordinary\nalgebra, Boole needed ways to interpret the usual operations and\nconstants of algebra to create his algebra of logic for classes.\nMultiplication was interpreted as intersection, leading to his one new\nlaw, the idempotent law \\(XX = X\\) for multiplication, rediscovering a\nlogical law already formulated by Leibniz. Addition was defined as\nunion, provided one was dealing with disjoint classes; and\nsubtraction as class difference, provided one was subtracting a\nsubclass from a class. In other cases, the addition and subtraction\noperations were simply undefined, or as Boole wrote,\nuninterpretable. The usual laws of arithmetic told Boole that\n1 must be the universe and \\(1 - X\\) must be the complement of\n\\(X\\).\n\nThe next step in Boole\u2019s system was to translate the four kinds of\ncategorical propositions into equations, for example \u201cAll \\(X\\)\nis \\(Y\\)\u201d becomes \\(X = XY\\), and \u201cSome \\(X\\) is\n\\(Y\\)\u201d becomes \\(V = XY\\), where \\(V\\) is a new symbol. To\neliminate the middle term in a syllogism Boole borrowed an elimination\ntheorem from ordinary algebra, but it was too weak for his algebra of\nlogic. This would be remedied in his 1854 book. Boole found that he\ncould not always derive the desired conclusions with the above\ntranslation of particular propositions (i.e., those with existential\nimport), so he added the variants \\(X = VY\\), \\(Y = VX\\), and \\(VX =\nVY\\) (see the entry on\n Boole).\n\nThe symbolic algebra of the 1800s included much more than just the\nalgebra of polynomials, and Boole experimented to see which results\nand tools might apply to the algebra of logic. For example, he proved\none of his results by using an infinite series expansion. His\nfascination with the possibilities of ordinary algebra led him to\nconsider questions such as: What would logic be like if the idempotent\nlaw were replaced by the law \\(X^3 = X\\)? His successors, especially\nJevons, would soon narrow the operations on classes to the ones that\nwe use today, namely union, intersection and complement.\n\nAs mentioned earlier, three-quarters of the way through his brief book\nof 1847, after finishing derivations of the traditional Aristotelian\nsyllogisms in his system, Boole announced that his algebra of logic\nwas capable of far more general applications. Then he proceeded to add\ngeneral theorems on developing (expanding) terms, providing\ninterpretations of equations, and using long division to express one\nclass in an equation in terms of the other classes (with side\nconditions added).\n\nBoole\u2019s theorems, completed and perfected in 1854, gave algorithms for\nanalyzing infinitely many argument forms. This opened a new and\nfruitful perspective, deviating from the traditional approach to\nlogic, where for centuries scholars had struggled to come up with\nclever mnemonics to memorize a very small catalog of valid conversions\nand syllogisms and their various interrelations.\n\nDe Morgan\u2019s Formal Logic did not gain significant\nrecognition, primarily because it was a large collection of small\nfacts without a significant synthesis. Boole\u2019s The Mathematical\nAnalysis of Logic had powerful methods that caught the attention\nof a few scholars such as De Morgan and Arthur Cayley\n(1821\u20131895); but immediately there were serious questions about\nthe workings of Boole\u2019s algebra of logic: Just how closely was it tied\nto ordinary algebra? How could Boole justify the procedures of his\nalgebra of logic? In retrospect it seems quite certain that Boole did\nnot know why his system worked. His claim, following Gregory, that in\norder to justify using ordinary algebra it was enough to check the\ncommutative law \\(XY = YX\\) for multiplication and the distributive\nlaw \\(X(Y + Z) = XY + XZ\\), is clearly false. Nonetheless it is also\nlikely that he had checked his results in a sufficient number of cases\nto give substance to his belief that his system was correct.\n3. 1854\u2014Boole\u2019s Final Presentation of his Algebra of Logic\n\nIn his second book, The Laws of Thought, Boole not only\napplied algebraic methods to traditional logic but also attempted some\nreforms to logic. He started by augmenting the laws of his 1847\nalgebra of logic (without explicitly saying that his previous list of\nthree axioms was inadequate), and made some comments on the rule of\ninference (performing the same operation on both sides of an\nequation). But then he casually stated that the foundation of his\nsystem actually rested on a single (new) principle, namely it sufficed\nto check an argument by seeing if it was correct when the class\nsymbols took on only the values 0 and 1, and the operations were the\nusual arithmetical operations. Let us call this Boole\u2019s Rule of 0\nand 1. No meaningful justification was given for Boole\u2019s adoption\nof this new foundation, it was not given a special name, and the scant\nreferences to it in the rest of the book were usually rather clumsily\nstated. For a modern analysis of this Rule of 0 and 1 see Burris &\nSankappanavar 2013.\n\nThe development of the algebra of logic in the Laws of\nThought proceeded much as in his 1847 book, with minor changes to\nhis translation scheme, and with the selection operators replaced by\nclasses. There is a new and very important theorem (correcting the one\nhe had used in 1847), the Elimination Theorem, which says the\nfollowing: given an equation \\(F(x,y, z, \\ldots) = 0\\) in the class\nsymbols \\(x, y, z\\), etc., the most general conclusion that follows\nfrom eliminating certain of the class symbols is obtained by (1)\nsubstituting 0s and 1s into \\(F(x, y, z, \\ldots)\\) for the symbols to\nbe eliminated, in all possible ways, then (2) multiplying these\nvarious substitution instances together and setting the product equal\nto 0. Thus eliminating \\(y\\) and \\(z\\) from \\(F(x, y, z) = 0\\) gives\n\\(F(x, 0, 0)F(x, 0, 1)F(x, 1, 0)F(x, 1, 1) = 0\\). This theorem also\nplayed an important role in Boole\u2019s interpretation of Aristotle\u2019s\nsyllogistic.\n\nFrom an algebra of logic point of view, the 1854 treatment at times\nseems less elegant than that in the 1847 book, but it gives a much\nricher insight into how Boole thinks about the foundations for his\nalgebra of logic. The final chapter on logic, Chapter XV, was an\nattempt to give a uniform proof of the Aristotelian conversions and\nsyllogisms. (It is curious that prior to Chapter XV Boole did not\npresent any examples of arguments involving particular propositions.)\nThe details of Chapter XV are quite involved, mainly because of the\nincrease in size of expressions when the Elimination and Development\nTheorems are applied. Boole simply left most of the work to the\nreader. Later commentators would gloss over this chapter, and no one\nseems to have worked through its details.\n\nAside from the Rule of 0 and 1 and the Elimination Theorem, the 1854\npresentation is mainly interesting for Boole\u2019s attempts to justify his\nalgebra of logic. He argued that in symbolical algebra it was quite\nacceptable to carry out equational deductions with partial operations,\njust as one would when the operations were total, as long as the terms\nin the premises and the conclusion were interpretable. He said this\nwas the way ordinary algebra worked with the uninterpretable\n\\(\\sqrt{-1}\\), the square root of \u22121. (The geometric\ninterpretation of complex numbers was recognized early on by Wessel,\nArgand, and Gauss, but it was only with the publications of Gauss and\nHamilton in the 1830s that doubts about the acceptability of complex\nnumbers in the larger mathematical community were overcome. It is\ncurious that in 1854 Boole regarded \\(\\sqrt{-1}\\) as\nuninterpretable.)\n\nThere were a number of concerns regarding Boole\u2019s approach to the\nalgebra of logic:\n\nWas there a meaningful tie between his algebra of logic and the\nalgebra of numbers, or was it just an accident that they were so\nsimilar?\nCould one handle particular propositions in an algebraic logic\nthat focused on equations?\nWas it really acceptable to work with uninterpretable terms in\nequational derivations?\nWas Boole using \u201cAristotelian\u201d semantics (the\nsemantics presupposed in traditional logic, where the extension of a\nterm is nonempty)?\n\n4. Jevons: An Algebra of Logic Based on Total Operations\n\nJevons, who had studied with De Morgan, was the first to offer an\nalternative to Boole\u2019s system. In 1863 he wrote to Boole that surely\nBoole\u2019s operation of addition should be replaced by the more natural\n\u2018inclusive or\u2019 (or \u2018union\u2019), leading to the\nlaw \\(X + X = X\\). Boole completely rejected this suggestion (it would\nhave destroyed his system based on ordinary algebra) and broke off the\ncorrespondence. Jevons published his system in his 1864 book, Pure\nLogic (reprinted in Jevons 1890). By \u2018pure\u2019 he meant\nthat he was casting off any dependence on the algebra of\nnumbers\u2014instead of classes, which are associated with quantity,\nhe would use predicates, which are associated with quality, and his\nlaws would be derived directly from the (total) fundamental operations\nof inclusive disjunction and conjunction. But he kept Boole\u2019s use of\nequations as the fundamental form of statements in his algebra of\nlogic.\n\nBy adopting De Morgan\u2019s convention of using upper-case/lower-case\nletters for complements, Jevons\u2019 system was not suited to provide\nequational axioms for modern Boolean algebra. However, he refined his\nsystem of axioms and rules of inference until the result was\nessentially the modern system of Boolean algebra for ground\nterms, that is, terms where the class symbols are to be thought\nof as constants, not as variables.\n\nIt must be noticed that modern equational logic deals with\nuniversally quantified equations (which would have been\ncalled laws in the 1800s). In the 19th century\nalgebra of logic one could translate \u201cAll \\(X\\) is \\(Y\\)\u201d\nas the equation \\(X = XY\\). This is not to be viewed as the\nuniversally quantified expression \\((\\forall X)(\\forall Y)(X = XY)\\).\n\\(X\\) and \\(Y\\) are to be treated as constants (or schematic letters).\nTerms that only have constants (no variables) are called\nground terms.\n\nBy carrying out this analysis in the special setting of an algebra of\npredicates (or equivalently, in an algebra of classes) Jevons played\nan important role in the development of modern equational logic. As\nmentioned earlier, Boole gave inadequate sets of equational axioms for\nhis system, originally starting with the two laws due to Gregory plus\nhis idempotent law; these were accompanied by De Morgan\u2019s inference\nrule that one could carry out the same operation (Boole\u2019s fundamental\noperations in his algebra of logic were addition, subtraction and\nmultiplication) on equals and obtain equals. Boole then switched to\nthe simple and powerful (but unexplained) Rule of 0 and 1.\n\nHaving replaced Boole\u2019s fundamental operations with total operations,\nJevons proceeded, over a period of many years, to work on the axioms\nand rules for his system. Some elements of equational logic that we\nnow take for granted required a considerable number of years for\nJevons to resolve:\n\nThe Reflexive Law (\\(A=A\\)). In 1864 Jevons listed this as a\npostulate (1890, p. 11) and then in \u00a724 he referred to \\(A = A\\)\nas a \u201cuseless Identical proposition\u201d. In his 1869 paper on\nsubstitution it became the \u201cLaw of Identity\u201d. In the\nPrinciples of Science (1874) it was one of the three\n\u201cFundamental Laws of Thought\u201d.\n\nThe Symmetric Law (\\(B = A\\) follows from \\(A = B\\)). In 1864\nJevons wrote \u201c\\(A = B\\) and \\(B = A\\) are the same\nstatement\u201d. This is a position he would maintain. In 1874 he\nwrote\n\n\nI shall consider the two forms \\(A = B\\) and \\(B = A\\) to express\nexactly the same identity written differently.\n\n\nFor a final form of his algebra of logic we turn to the laws which he\nhad scattered over 40 pages in Principles of Science (1874),\nhaving replaced his earlier use of + by \\(\\ORjev\\), evidently to move\nfurther away from any appearance of a connection with the algebra of\nnumbers:\n\nLaws of Combination \n\n\\[ \\begin{align} A &= AA = AAA = \\& c & \\mbox{Law of\nSimplicity (p. 33)}\\\\ AB &= BA & \\mbox{A Law of\nCommutativeness (p. 35)}\\\\ A \\ORjev A & = A &\\mbox{Law of\nUnity (p. 72)}\\\\ A \\ORjev B &= B \\ORjev A &\\mbox{A Law of\nCommutativeness (p. 72)}\\\\ A(B \\ORjev C) &= AB \\ORjev AC &\n\\mbox{(no name given) (p. 76)}\\\\ \\end{align} \\]\n\n\nLaws of Thought \n\n\\[ \\begin{align} A &= A & \\mbox{Law of Identity (p. 74)}\\\\ Aa\n&= o & \\mbox{Law of Contradiction (p. 74)}\\\\ A &= AB\n\\ORjev Ab & \\mbox{Law of Duality (p. 74)}\\\\ \\end{align} \\]\n\n\nFor his single rule of inference Jevons chose his principle of\nsubstitution\u2014in modern terms this was essentially a combination\nof ground replacement and transitivity. He showed how to derive\ntransitivity of equality from this; he could have derived symmetry as\nwell but did not. The associative law was missing\u2014it was\nimplicit in the lack of parentheses in his expressions.\n\nIt was only in his Studies in Deductive Logic (1880) that\nJevons mentioned McColl\u2019s use of an accent to indicate negation. After\nnoting that McColl\u2019s accent allowed one to take the negation of\ncomplex bracketed terms he went on to say that, for the most part, he\nfound the notation of De Morgan, the notation that he had always used,\nto be the more elegant.\n5. Peirce: Basing the Algebra of Logic on Subsumption\n\nPeirce started his research into the algebra of logic in the late\n1860s. In his paper \u201cOn an Improvement in Boole\u2019s calculus of\nLogic\u201d (Peirce 1867), he arrived independently at the same\nconclusion that Jevons had reached earlier, that one needed to replace\nBoole\u2019s partial operation of addition with the total operation of\nunion (see CP 3.3.6). In his important 1880 paper, \u201cOn the\nAlgebra of Logic\u201d, Peirce quietly broke with the traditional\nextensional semantics and introduced a usual assumption of modern\nsemantics: the extension of a concept, understood as a class, could be\nempty (as well as the universe), and stated the truth values of the\ncategorical propositions that we use today. For example, he said the\nproposition \u201cAll \\(A\\) is \\(B\\)\u201d is true if \\(A\\) and\n\\(B\\) are both the empty class. Conversion by Limitation, that is, the\nargument \u201cAll \\(A\\) is \\(B\\)\u201d therefore \u201cSome \\(B\\)\nis \\(A\\)\u201d, was no longer a valid inference. Peirce said nothing\nabout the reasons for and merits of his departure from the traditional\nsemantic assumption of existence.\n\nPeirce also broke with Boole\u2019s and Jevons\u2019 use of equality as the\nfundamental primitive, using instead the relation of\n\u201csubsumption\u201d interpretable in different ways (subclass\nrelation, implication, etc.). He stated the partial order properties\nof subsumption and then proceeded to define the operations of + and\n\u00d7 as least upper bounds and greatest lower bounds\u2014he\nimplicitly assumed such bounds existed\u2014and listed the key\nequational properties of the algebras with two binary operations that\nwe now call lattices. Then he claimed that the distributive law\nfollowed, but said the proof was too tedious to include. The\nfruitfulness of this perspective is evident in his seminal paper from\n1885. There Peirce introduced a system for propositional logic based\non five axioms for implication (represented by the sign\n\u2018\\(-\\kern-.4em<\\)\u2019), including what is now called\nPeirce\u2019s law. It certainly made the algebra of logic more elegant.\n6. De Morgan and Peirce: Relations and Quantifiers in the Algebra of Logic\n\nDe Morgan wrote a series of six papers called \u201cOn the\nSyllogism\u201d in the years 1846 to 1863 (reprinted in De Morgan\n1966). In his efforts to generalize the syllogism, De Morgan replaced\nthe copula \u201cis\u201d with a general binary relation in the\nsecond paper of the series dating from 1850. By allowing different\nbinary relations in the two premises of a syllogism, he was led to\nintroduce the composition of the two binary relations to express the\nconclusion of the syllogism. In this pursuit of generalized syllogisms\nhe introduced various other operations on binary relations, including\nthe converse operation, and he developed a fragment of a calculus for\nthese operations. His main paper on this subject was the fourth in the\nseries, called \u201cOn the syllogism, No. IV, and on the logic of\nrelations\u201d published in 1859 (see De Morgan 1966).\n\nFollowing De Morgan\u2019s paper, Peirce, in his paper \u201cDescription\nof a Notation for the Logic of Relatives, resulting from an\nAmplification of the Conceptions of Boole\u2019s Calculus of Logic\u201d\nfrom 1870, lifted Boole\u2019s work to the setting of binary\nrelations\u2014with binary relations one had, in addition to union,\nintersection and complement, the natural operations of composition and\nconverse. A binary relation was characterized as a set of ordered\npairs (see 3.328). He worked on this new calculus between 1870 and\n1883. Like De Morgan, Peirce also considered a number of other natural\noperations on relations. Peirce\u2019s main paper on the subject was\n\u201cOn the Algebra of Logic\u201d (1880). By employing\nunrestricted unions, denoted by \u03a3, and unrestricted\nintersections, denoted by \u03a0, Peirce thus introduced quantifiers\ninto his algebra of logic.\n\nIn a paper from 1882, \u201cBrief Description of the Algebra of\nRelatives\u201d, reprinted in De Morgan 1966, he used these\nquantifiers to define operations on relations by means of operations\non certain kind of coefficients. De Morgan gets credit for introducing\nthe concept of relation, but Peirce is considered the true creator of\nthe theory of relations (see, e.g., Tarski 1941: 73). However, Peirce\ndid not develop this theory. As Calixto Badesa wrote, \u201cthe\ncalculus of relatives was never to Peirce\u2019s liking\u201d (Badesa\n2004: 32). He considered it too complicated because of the combination\nof class operations with relational ones. Instead, he preferred from\n1885 onwards to develop a \u201cgeneral algebra\u201d including\nquantifiers but no operation on relations. In this way, he arrived at\nan elementary and informal presentation of what is now called\nfirst-order logic (see Badesa 2004, loc. cit.).\n7. Schr\u00f6der\u2019s systematization of the algebra of logic\n\nThe German mathematician Ernst Schr\u00f6der played a key role in the\ntradition of the algebra of logic. A good example was his challenge to\nPeirce to provide a proof of the distributive law, as one of the key\nequational properties of the algebras with two binary operations.\nPeirce (1885) admitted that he could not provide a proof. Years later\nHuntington (1904: 300\u2013301) described part of the content of a\nletter he had received from Peirce in December 1903 that claimed to\nprovide the missing proof\u2014evidently Peirce had stumbled across\nthe long lost pages after the death of Schr\u00f6der in 1902. Peirce\nexplained to Huntington that he had originally assumed Schr\u00f6der\u2019s\nchallenge was well-founded and that this apparent shortcoming of his\npaper \u201cwas to be added to the list of blunders, due to the\ngrippe, with which that paper abounds, \u2026\u201d. Actually\nPeirce\u2019s proof did not correct the error since the distributive law\ndoes not hold in lattices in general; instead his proof brought in the\noperation of complementation\u2014he used the axiom\n\n\nif \\(a\\) is not contained in the complement of \\(b\\) then \\(a\\) and\n\\(b\\) have a common lower bound.\n\n\nOn the basis of his previous algebraic work, Schr\u00f6der wrote an\nencyclopedic three volume work at the end of the 19th\ncentury called Vorlesungen \u00fcber die Algebra der Logik\n(1890\u20131905), built on the subsumption framework with the modern\nsemantics of classes as presented by Peirce. This work was the result\nof his research in algebra and revealed different influences.\nSchr\u00f6der aimed at a general algebraic theory with applications in\nmany mathematical fields, where the algebra of logic was at the core.\nAs Geraldine Brady pointed out, it offers the first exposition of\nabstract lattice theory, the first exposition of Dedekind\u2019s theory of\nchains after Dedekind, the most comprehensive development of the\ncalculus of relations, and a treatment of the foundations of\nmathematics on the basis of the relation calculus (see Brady 2000: 143\nf.)\n\nThe first volume concerned the equational logic of classes, the main\nresult being Boole\u2019s Elimination Theorem of 1854. Three rather\ncomplicated counter-examples to Peirce\u2019s claim of distributivity\nappeared in an appendix to Vol. I, one of which involved nine-hundred\nand ninety identities for quasigroups. On the basis of this volume,\nDedekind (1897) composed an elegant modern abstract presentation of\nlattices (which he called Dualgruppen); in this paper he\npresented a five-element counter-example to Peirce\u2019s claim of the\ndistributive law.\n\nVolume II augments the algebra of logic for classes developed in\nVolume I so that it can handle existential statements. First, using\nmodern semantics, Schr\u00f6der proved that one cannot use equations\nto express \u201cSome \\(X\\) is \\(Y\\)\u201d. However, he noted that\none can easily express it with a negated equation, namely \\(XY \\ne\n0\\). Volume II, a study of the calculus of classes using both\nequations and negated equations, attempted to cover the same topics\ncovered in Vol. I, in particular there was considerable effort devoted\nto finding an Elimination Theorem. After dealing with several special\ncases, Schr\u00f6der recommended this topic as an important research\narea\u2014the quest for an Elimination Theorem would be known as the\nElimination Problem.\n\nInspired mainly by Peirce\u2019s work, Schr\u00f6der examined the algebra\nof logic for binary relations in Vol. III of his Vorlesungen\n\u00fcber die Algebra der Logik. As Tarski once noted, Peirce\u2019s\nwork was continued and extended in a very thorough and systematic way\nby Schr\u00f6der. One item of particular fascination for him was this:\ngiven an equation \\(E(x, y, z, \\ldots) = 0\\) in this algebra, find the\ngeneral solution for one of the relation symbols, say for \\(x\\), in\nterms of the other relation symbols. He managed, given a particular\nsolution \\(x = x0\\), to find a remarkable term \\(S(t, y, z, \\ldots)\\)\nwith the following properties: (1) \\(x = S(t, y, z, \\ldots)\\) yields a\nsolution to \\(E = 0\\) for any choice of relation \\(t\\), and (2) every\nsolution \\(x\\) of \\(E = 0\\) can be obtained in this manner by choosing\na suitable \\(t\\). Peirce was not impressed by Schr\u00f6der\u2019s\npreoccupation with the problem of solving equations, and pointed out\nthat Schr\u00f6der\u2019s parametric solution was a bit of a hoax\u2014the\nexpressive power of the algebra of logic for relations was so strong\nthat by evaluating the term \\(S(t, y, z, \\ldots)\\) one essentially\ncarried out the steps to check if \\(E(t, y, z, \\ldots) = 0\\); if the\nanswer was yes then \\(S(t, y, z, \\ldots)\\) returned the value \\(t\\),\notherwise it would return the value \\(x0\\).\n\nSumming up, Schr\u00f6der constructed an algebraic version of modern\npredicate logic and also a theory of relations. He applied it to\ndifferent fields (e.g., Cantor\u2019s set theory), and he considered his\nalgebraic notation as a general or universal language\n(pasigraphy, see Peckhaus 2004 and Legris 2012). It is to be\nnoted that L\u00f6wenheim in 1940 still thought it was as reasonable\nas set theory. According to him, Schr\u00f6der\u2019s idea of solving a\nrelational equation was a precursor of Skolem functions, and\nSchr\u00f6der inspired L\u00f6wenheim\u2019s formulation and proof of the\nfamous theorem that every \u201carithmetical\u201d sentence with an\ninfinite model has a countable model. Schr\u00f6der\u2019s calculus of\nrelations was the basis for the doctoral dissertation of Norbert\nWiener (1894\u20131964) in Harvard (Wiener 1913). According to Brady,\nWiener gave the first axiomatic treatment of the calculus of\nrelations, preceding Tarski\u2019s axiomatization by more than twenty years\n(see Brady 2000: 165).\n8. Huntington: Axiomatic Investigations of the Algebra of Logic\n\nAt the turn of the 19th Century, David Hilbert\n(1862\u20131943) presented, in his Grundlagen der Geometrie,\nEuclidean geometry as an axiomatic subject that did not depend on\ndiagrams for its proofs (Hilbert 1899). This led to a wave of interest\nin studying axiom systems in mathematics; in particular one wanted to\nknow if the axioms were independent, and which primitives led to the\nmost elegant systems. Edward Vermilye Huntington (1874\u20131952) was\none of the first to examine this issue for the algebra of logic. He\ngave three axiomatizations of the algebra of logic, showed each set of\naxioms was independent, and that they were equivalent (see Huntington\n1904). In 1933 he returned to this topic with three new sets of\naxioms, one of which contained the following three equations (1933:\n280): \n\n\\[ \\begin{align} a + b &= b + a \\\\ (a + b) + c &= a + (b + c)\n\\\\ (a' + b')' + (a' + b)' &= a. \\end{align} \\]\n\n\nShortly after this, Herbert Robbins (1915\u20132001) conjectured that\nthe third equation could be replaced by the slightly simpler\n\n\\[ [(a + b)' + (a + b')']' = a. \\]\n\n\nNeither Huntington nor Robbins could prove this, and later it\nwithstood the efforts of many others, including even Tarski and his\ntalented school at Berkeley. Building on partial results of Winker,\nthe automated theorem prover EQP, designed by William McCune of the\nArgonne National Laboratory, found a proof of the Robbins Conjecture\nin 1996. This accomplishment was popularized in Kolata 2010.\n\nAccording to Huntington (1933: 278), the term \u201cBoolean\nalgebra\u201d was introduced by Henry M. Sheffer (1882\u20131964) in\nthe paper where he showed that one could give a five-equation\naxiomatization of Boolean algebra using the single fundamental\noperation of joint exclusion, now known as the Sheffer stroke (see\nSheffer 1913). Whitehead and Russell claimed in the preface to the\nsecond edition of Principia that the Sheffer stroke was the\ngreatest advance in logic since the publication of Principia.\n(Hilbert and Ackermann (1928), by contrast, stated that the Sheffer\nstroke was just a curiosity.) Neither realized that decades earlier\nSchr\u00f6der had discovered that the dual of the Sheffer stroke was\nalso such an operation\u2014Schr\u00f6der\u2019s symbol for his operation\nwas that of a double-edged sword.\n\nIn the 1930s Garrett Birkhoff (1911\u20131996) established the\nfundamental results of equational logic, namely (1) equational classes\nof algebras are precisely the classes closed under homomorphisms,\nsubalgebras and direct products, and (2) equational logic is based on\nfive rules: reflexivity, symmetry, transitivity, replacement, and\nsubstitution. In the 1940s, Tarski joined in this development of\nequational logic; the subject progressed rapidly from the 1950s till\nthe present time.\n9. Stone: Models for the Algebra of Logic\n\nTraditional logic studied certain simple relationships between\nclasses, namely being a subclass of and having a nonempty\nintersection with. However, once one adopted an axiomatic\napproach, the topic of possible models besides the obvious ones\nsurfaced. Beltrami introduced models of non-Euclidean geometry in the\nlate 1860s. In the 1890s Schr\u00f6der and Dedekind constructed models\nof the axioms of lattice theory to show that the distributive law did\nnot follow. But when it came to the algebra of classes, Schr\u00f6der\nconsidered only the standard models, namely each was the collection of\nall subclasses of a given class.\n\nThe study of general models of the axioms of Boolean algebra did not\nget underway until the late 1920s; it was soon brought to a very high\nlevel in the work of Marshall Harvey Stone (1903\u20131989) (see his\npapers 1936, 1937). He was interested in the structure of rings of\nlinear operators and realized that the central idempotents, that is,\nthe operators \\(E\\) that commuted with all other operators in the ring\nunder multiplication (that is, \\(EL = LE\\) for all \\(L\\) in the ring)\nand which were idempotent under multiplication (\\(EE = E\\)) played an\nimportant role. In a natural way, the central idempotents formed a\nBoolean algebra.\n\nPursuing this direction of research led Stone to ask about the\nstructure of an arbitrary Boolean algebra, a question that he answered\nby proving that every Boolean algebra is isomorphic to a Boolean\nalgebra of sets. In his work on Boolean algebras he noticed a\ncertain analogy between kernels of homomorphisms and the ideals\nstudied in ring theory\u2014this led him to give the name\n\u201cideal\u201d to such kernels. Not long after this he discovered\na translation between Boolean algebras and Boolean rings; under this\ntranslation the ideals of a Boolean algebra corresponded precisely to\nthe ideals of the associated Boolean ring. His next major contribution\nwas to establish a correspondence between Boolean algebras and certain\ntopological spaces now called Boolean spaces (or Stone spaces). This\ncorrespondence would later prove to be a valuable tool in the\nconstruction of exotic Boolean algebras. These results of Stone are\nstill a paradigm for developments in the algebra of logic.\n\nInspired by the rather brief treatment of first-order statements about\nrelations in Vol. III of the Algebra der Logik,\nL\u00f6wenheim (1915) showed that if such a statement could be\nsatisfied in an infinite domain then it could be satisfied in a\ndenumerable domain. In 1920 Thoralf Skolem (1887\u20131963)\nsimplified L\u00f6wenheim\u2019s proof by introducing Skolem normal forms,\nand in 1928 Skolem replaced his use of normal forms with a simpler\nidea, namely to use what are now called Skolem functions. He used\nthese functions to convert first-order sentences into universal\nsentences, that is to say, into sentences in prenex form with all\nquantifiers being universal (\\(\\forall\\)).\n10. Skolem: Quantifier Elimination and Decidability\n\nSkolem was strongly influenced by Schr\u00f6der\u2019s Algebra der\nLogik, starting with his PhD Thesis. Later he took a particular\ninterest in the quest for an Elimination Theorem in the calculus of\nclasses. In his 1919 paper he established some results for lattices,\nin particular, he showed that one could decide the validity of\nuniversal Horn sentences (i.e., universal sentences with a matrix that\nis a disjunction of negated and unnegated atoms, with at most one\npositive atom) by a procedure that we now recognize to be a polynomial\ntime algorithm. This algorithm was based on finding a least fixed\npoint of a finite partial lattice under production rules derived from\nuniversal Horn sentences. Although this result, which is equivalent to\nthe uniform word problem for lattices, was in the same paper as\nSkolem\u2019s famous contribution to L\u00f6wenheim\u2019s Theorem, it was\nforgotten until a chance rediscovery in the early 1990s. (Whitman\n(1941) gave a different solution to the more limited equational\ndecision problem for lattices; it became widely known as the solution\nto the word problem in lattices.)\n\nSkolem (1920) gave an elegant solution to the Elimination Problem\nposed by Schr\u00f6der for the calculus of classes by showing that if\none added predicates to express \u201chas at least \\(n\\)\nelements\u201d, for each \\(n = 1, 2, \\ldots\\), then there was a\nsimple (but often lengthy) procedure to convert a first-order formula\nabout classes into a quantifier-free formula. In particular this\nshowed that the first-order theory of the calculus of classes was\ndecidable. This quantifier-elimination result was used by Mostowski\n(1952) to analyze first-order properties of direct powers and direct\nsums of single structures, and then by Feferman and Vaught (1959) to\ndo the same for general direct sums and direct products of\nstructures.\n\nThe elimination of quantifiers became a main method in mathematical\nlogic to prove decidability, and proving decidability was stated as\nthe main problem of mathematical logic in Hilbert and Ackermann\n(1928)\u2014this goal was dropped in subsequent editions because of\nthe famous undecidability result of Church and Turing.\n11. Tarski and the Revival of Algebraic Logic\n\nModel theory can be regarded as the product of Hilbert\u2019s methodology\nof metamathematics and the algebra of logic tradition, represented\nspecifically by the results due to L\u00f6wenheim and Skolem. But it\nwas Tarski who gave the discipline its classical foundation. Model\ntheory is the study of the relations between a formal language and its\ninterpretation in \u201crealizations\u201d (that is, a domain for\nthe variables of the language together with an interpretation for its\nprimitive signs). If the interpretation happens to make a sentence of\nthe language state something true, then the interpretation is a\nmodel of the sentence (see the entry on\n model theory).\n Models consist basically of algebraic structures, and model theory\nbecame an autonomous mathematical discipline with its roots not only\nin the algebra of logic but in abstract algebra (see Sinaceur\n1999).\n\nApart from model theory, Tarski revived the algebra of relations in\nhis 1941 paper \u201cOn the Calculus of Relations\u201d. First he\noutlined a formal logic based on allowing quantification over both\nelements and relations, and then he turned to a more detailed study of\nthe quantifier-free formulas of this system that involved only\nrelation variables. After presenting a list of axioms that obviously\nheld in the algebra of relations as presented in Schr\u00f6der\u2019s third\nvolume he proved that these axioms allowed one to reduce\nquantifier-free relation formulas to equations. Thus his calculus of\nrelations became the study of a certain equational theory which he\nnoted had the same relation to the study of all binary relations on\nsets as the equational theory of Boolean algebra had to the study of\nall subsets of sets. This led to questions paralleling those already\nposed and resolved for Boolean algebras, for example, was every model\nof his axioms for relation algebras isomorphic to an algebra of\nrelations on a set? One question had been answered by Arwin Korselt\n(1864\u20131947), namely there were first-order sentences in the\ntheory of binary relations that were not equivalent to an equation in\nthe calculus of relations\u2014thus the calculus of relations\ndefinitely had a weaker expressive power than the first-order theory\nof relations. Actually the expressive power of relation algebra is\nexactly equivalent to first-order logic with just three variables.\nHowever, if in relation algebras (the calculus of relations) one wants\nto formalize a set theory which has something such as the pair axiom,\nthen one can reduce many variables to three variables, and so it is\npossible to express any first-order statement of such a theory by an\nequation. Monk proved that, unlike the calculus of classes, there is\nno finite equational basis for the calculus of binary relations (see\nMonk 1964). Tarski and Givant (1987) showed that the equational logic\nof relation algebras is so expressive that one can carry out\nfirst-order set theory in it.\n\nFurthermore, cylindric algebras, essentially Boolean algebras equipped\nwith unary cylindric operations \\(C_x\\) which are intended to capture\nthe existential quantifiers (\\(\\exists x\\)), were introduced in the\nyears 1948\u20131952 by Tarski, working with his students Louise Chin\nand Frederick Thompson (see Henkin & Tarski 1961), to create an\nalgebra of logic that captured the expressive power of the first-order\ntheory of binary relations. Polyadic algebra is another approach to an\nalgebra of logic for first-order logic\u2014it was created by Halmos\n(1956c). The focus of work in these systems was again to see to what\nextent one could parallel the famous results of Stone for Boolean\nalgebra from the 1930s.\n",
