Aristotle\u2019s Conclusion and Implications for Ethics and Politics\n\nAt the end of chapter 6, Aristotle concludes, \u201cLet this, then\nsuffice to show (1) that the firmest belief is that opposite\nassertions are not true at the same time, (2) what happens to those\nwho speak in this way and (3) why people do speak in this way\u201d\n(Metaph IV 6 1011b13\u201315).\n\nOn the first point, as we saw, it is controversial whether\nAristotle\u2019s conclusion that the firmest belief is a belief in\nPNC carries with it the presupposition that PNC is true, a\npresupposition that is needed for his own project of first philosophy.\nOn the third point, Aristotle discusses views about perception and\nchange that lead people to say that they reject PNC. On the second\npoint, Aristotle shows that those who say that they reject\nPNC do not really do so, or, if they do, they will be giving up\nintelligible discourse and action. It is controversial how much of an\nessentialist or indeed realist view one must accept if one accepts\nPNC, but it is clear that PNC is essential for the project of an\nAristotelian science.\n\nWithout PNC, Aristotle notes, beginners in philosophy who are\ninterested in the truth would be off on a wild goose chase\n(Metaph IV 5 1009b36\u20138). This applies to both\nmetaphysics and science, and to ethics and politics. Without PNC, and\nwithout the truth, we would be living in a world of mere sophistry\nand, although Aristotle fails to spell this out, power.\nAristotle\u2019s discussion of PNC, then, has broader ethical and\npolitical implications.\n",
