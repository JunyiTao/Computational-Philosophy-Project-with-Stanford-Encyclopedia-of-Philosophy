    "main_text": "\n\nIn the past 50 years, there has been burgeoning philosophical interest\nin well-being, health, and personal relationships. There has also been\nincreasing philosophical writing on disability, particularly in\nrelation to justice and equality. Until recently, however, there has\nbeen little philosophical discussion of disability's relevance to well-being,\nhealth, or personal relationships\u2014in contrast to the growing\nscholarship on these topics in the social sciences. Until the past\ndecade, most philosophical discussions of well-being simply treated\ndisabilities as conditions that reduced it. Philosophical\naccounts of health and disease have mentioned disability, but mainly\nto treat it as a form of disease or ill-health; they have had little\nto say about the complex, contested relationship between disease and\ndisability. And with the notable exception of parental attitudes\ntoward one\u2019s actual or possible disabled children, the role of\ndisability in personal relationships has provoked scant philosophical\ninterest.\n\nThis Entry will proceed as follows. Part 1 will discuss disability and\nwell-being. It will begin by reviewing debates on the application of\nthree standard accounts of well-being to disability. It will note the\ndivergence between first- and third-person assessments of the impact\nof disability on well-being under all these accounts and suggest\nsome reasons for this divergence. We will then examine what we regard\nas the most difficult challenge to the claim that many or most\ndisabilities do not necessarily reduce well-being: the widely-held\nview that it is desirable to prevent, correct, or mitigate\ndisabilities, and generally undesirable to acquire one. The concluding\nsection of Part 1 will examine how assumptions about disability and\nwell-being inform a number of contemporary debates in medicine and\nhealth care.\n\nPart 2 will examine philosophical writing on health and disease. It\nwill review different definitions of health and their implications for\nthe question of whether it is necessarily unhealthy to be disabled. It\nwill consider the few attempts that have been made to distinguish\ndisability from disease. It will also note a tension for disability\nscholars in making the distinction between disease and disability:\nalthough that distinction provides a basis for separating the medical\nfrom the socially constructed aspects of disability, it can also\noversimplify the experience of people with disabilities.\n\nPart 3 will discuss disability and personal relationships. It will\nexamine widely shared assumptions concerning the impact of\ndisabilities on a variety of relationships, in particular the doubts\nexpressed by many laypeople about the capacity of adults with\ndisabilities to become friends, lovers, and parents. This Part will\nalso consider how historical and contemporary accounts of friendship\nand love apply to persons with disabilities.\n\nAfter exploring the relevance of disability to well-being, health, and\npersonal relationships, this Entry will conclude by examining common\nfeatures of the philosophical treatment of disability in the three\ndomains. Philosophical scrutiny is particularly needed in these areas,\nbecause of the strength and persistence of popular assumptions about\nthe adverse impact of disability on all three.\n\nThe impact that disability has on each domain is largely a function of\nthe view or model of disability one accepts. Disability scholars and\nphilosophers of disability now refer to two models of disability, the\nmedical and the social (see\n SEP entry on disability: definitions, models, experience).\n For present purposes, we understand the social model of disability as\nholding that the physical and social environment are the primary\nsource of the limitations and disadvantages faced by people with\nalmost all impairments. This model has obvious relevance for the\naccounts of well-being, health, and personal relationships we will\nexamine. It suggests that if people with disabilities appear to be\nunhappy, unhealthy, or socially isolated, it is primarily due to\ncontingent features of their physical and social environments, not to\nany intrinsic features of their impaired functions. In some cases,\nthis recognition will require a reassessment of their present\nwell-being, health, or social relationships. In other cases, it will\nnot challenge that assessment, but will alter the prescription for\nimproving their well-being, health, or relationships, or the\nexpectation of success in doing so.\n",
