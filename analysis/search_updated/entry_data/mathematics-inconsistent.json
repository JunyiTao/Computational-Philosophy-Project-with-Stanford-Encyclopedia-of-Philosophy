    "main_text": "\n1. Foundations of Mathematics\n\nInconsistent Mathematics began historically with foundational\nconsiderations. Frege and Russell proposed to found their mathematics\non the naive principle of set theory: to every predicate is a set. But\nthe naive principle leads rapidly to a proof of the existence of the\nRussell set, the set of all sets not members of themselves, which both\nis and is not a member of itself. This and other set-theoretic\nparadoxes noted by Russell and others led to attempts to produce\nconsistent set theories as a foundation for mathematics. Perhaps the\nbest known of these was Zermelo-Fraenkel set theory ZF. But ZF and\nothers such as NBG and the like were in various ways ad hoc, having to\ninclude multiple independent principles instead of a single simple\ncomprehension axiom. Hence, a number of people including da Costa\n(1974), Brady (1971, 1989), Priest, Routley, & Norman (1989, pp.\n152, 498), considered it preferable to retain the full power of the\nnatural comprehension principle, and tolerate a degree of\ninconsistency in set theory. Brady, in particular, has extended,\nstreamlined and simplified these results on naive set theory in his\nbook (2006). For a clear account see also Restall\u2019s review\n(2007).\n\nThese constructions require, of course, that one dispense at\nleast with that principle of Boolean logic ex contradictione\nquodlibet (ECQ) (from a contradiction every proposition may be\ndeduced, also called explosion). In passing, C.I.Lewis showed that ECQ\nfollows by a simple argument from the principle disjunctive syllogism\n(DS) (from A-or-B and not-A deduce\nB). So DS has to go too. Obviously, ECQ trivialises any\ninconsistent theory (triviality = every sentence is provable).\nNon-triviality should be regarded as a constraint on interesting\ntheories: a trivial theory is useless for mathematical calculation,\nsince a trivial theory does not distinguish principles in the theory\nfrom their negations. Similarly, considerable debate (Burgess 1981,\nMortensen 1983), made it clear that dispensing with DS was not so\ncounter-intuitive, especially when a plausible story emerged about the\nspecial conditions under which DS continues to hold.\n\nIt should also be noted that Brady\u2019s construction of\ninconsistent naive set theory opens the door to a revival of\nFrege-Russell logicism (briefly, that mathematics reduces to logic.)\nLogicism was widely held, even by Frege himself, to have been badly\ndamaged by the Russell Paradox. If the Russell Contradiction does not\nspread, then there is no obvious reason why one cannot hold that naive\nset theory provides an adequate foundation for mathematics, and that\nnaive set theory is deducible from logic via the naive comprehension\nschema. The only change needed is a move to an inconsistency-tolerant\nlogic. Even more radically, Weber, in related papers (2010), (2012),\n(2013), has taken the inconsistency to be a positive virtue, since it\nenables us to settle several questions that were left open by Cantor,\nnamely, that the well-ordering theorem and the axiom of choice are\nprovable, and that the Continuum Hypothesis is false (2012, 284). Some\nof these come out provably both true and false; wherein Weber is\nconcerned to advance proofs of the classical recapture, which\nis the project of showing that traditional results remain provable\n(2010, 72). This is invigorating new ground. Weber also showed\nsomething essential to this project, namely, that Cantor\u2019s\nTheorem continues to hold; that is, it does not depend on\noverly-strong logical principles which are contested by\nparaconsistentists. Retaining Cantor\u2019s Theorem is important in\nWeber\u2019s view, since different orders of infinity remain\navailable in inconsistent set theory.\n\nIn addition, mathematics contains machinery for a metalanguage, that\nis for talking about mathematics itself. This includes the concepts:\n(i) names for mathematical statements and other parts of syntax, (ii)\nself-reference, (iii) proof and (iv) truth. G\u00f6del\u2019s\ncontribution to the philosophy of mathematics was to show that the\nfirst three of these can be rigorously expressed in arithmetical\ntheories, albeit in theories which are either inconsistent or\nincomplete. The possibility of a well-structured example of the former\nof these two alternatives, namely inconsistency, was not taken\nseriously, again because of belief in ECQ. However, in addition\nnatural languages seem to have their own truth predicate. Combined\nwith self-reference this produces the Liar paradox, \u201cThis\nsentence is false\u201d, an inconsistency. Priest (1987) and Priest,\nRoutley and Norman (1989, p. 154) argued that the Liar had to be\nregarded as a statement both true and false, a true contradiction.\nThis represents another argument for studying inconsistent theories,\nnamely the claim that some contradictions are true, also known as\ndialetheism. Kripke (1975) proposed instead to model a truth\npredicate differently, in a consistent incomplete theory. We see below\nthat incompleteness and inconsistency are closely related.\n\nTo simplify the motivation, mathematics, like many another science,\nencounters anomalies, puzzles and paradoxes. Paradoxes typically\nappear in the form of contradictions where there are grounds for\naccepting incompatible sides of the contradiction. Mathematics\nprogresses at least in part by eliminating anomalies in favour of\nconsistent reconstructions. This has typically been the method of\naddressing anomalies, and it is facilitated by noticing that the\ncontradictions emerge in the foundations of mathematics. But it was\nnoticed in the later twentieth century that there is another way,\nnamely accept the contradiction and develop mathematical theories\ncontaining both sides of the contradiction. This would be impossible\nif the contradictory theory was erected on a logical foundation\ncontaining the Boolean principle Ex Contradictione Quodlibet ECQ, from\na contradiction everything follows. So ECQ has to be abandoned, but\nfortunetely that proves possible, indeed mathematically\nstraightforward. What remains is a rich field, of novel mathematical\napplications interesting in their own right, which sidestep the vexing\nquestions of which foundational principles to adopt, by developing\ncontradictions in areas of mathematics such as number theory or\nanalysis which are far from foundations. This is inconsistent\nmathematics.\n2. Arithmetic\n\nBut these remarks have been about foundations, and mathematics is not\nits foundations. Hence there is a further independent motive, to see\nwhat mathematical structure remains wherever the constraint\nof consistency is relaxed. But it would be wrong to regard this as in\nany way a repudiation of the structures studied in classical\nmathematics: inconsistent structures represent an addition to\nknown structures.\n\nRobert K. Meyer (1976) seems to have been the first to think of an\ninconsistent arithmetical theory. At this point, he was more\ninterested in the fate of a consistent theory, his relevant arithmetic\nR#. This amounts to the axioms for Peano arithmetic, with a base of\nthe quantified relevant logic RQ, and Meyer hoped that the weaker base\nof relevant logic would allow more models. He was right. There proved\nto be a whole class of inconsistent arithmetical theories; see Meyer\nand Mortensen (1984), for example. In a parallel with the above\nremarks on rehabilitating logicism, Meyer argued that these\narithmetical theories provide the basis for a revived Hilbert Program.\nHilbert\u2019s program was the project of rigorously formalising\nmathematics and proving its consistency by simple finitary/inductive\nprocedures. It was widely held to have been seriously damaged by\nG\u00f6del\u2019s Second Incompleteness Theorem, according to which\nthe consistency of arithmetic was unprovable within arithmetic itself.\nBut a consequence of Meyer\u2019s construction was that within his\narithmetic R# it was demonstrable by finitary means that whatever\ncontradictions there might happen to be, they could not adversely\naffect any numerical calculations. Hence Hilbert\u2019s goal of\nconclusively demonstrating that mathematics is trouble-free proves\nlargely achievable as long as inconsistency-tolerant logics are\nused.\n\nThe arithmetical models used by Meyer and Mortensen later proved to\nallow inconsistent representation of the truth predicate. They also\npermit representation of structures beyond natural number arithmetic,\nsuch as rings and fields, including their order properties.\nAxiomatisations were also provided. Recently, the finite inconsistent\narithmetical collapse models, a strictly larger class than those\nstudied by Meyer and Mortensen, have been completely characterised by\nGraham Priest. Collapse models are obtained from classical models by\ncollapsing the domain down to congruence classes generated by various\ncongruence relations. When members of the same congruence class are\nidentified, the theories produced are inconsistent. For example,\nMeyer\u2019s initial construction collapsed the integers under the\ncongruence modulo 2. This puts 0 and 2 in the same congruence\nclass, so that in a suitable three-valued logic, both 0=2 and\nnot-(0=2) hold. Priest showed that these models take a certain general\nform, see Priest (1997) and (2000). Strictly speaking, Priest went a\nlittle too far in including \u201cclique models\u201d. This was\ncorrected by Paris and Pathmanathan (2006), and extended into the\ninfinite by Paris and Sirokfskich (2008). Even more recently, Tedder\n(2015) obtained axiomatisations for the class of finite collapse\nmodels with a different background logic, Avron\u2019s A3.\n3. Analysis\n\nOne could hardly ignore the examples of analysis and its special case,\nthe calculus. For a model-theoretic approach to these see Mortensen\n(1990, 1995).\n\nNow Meyer\u2019s original approach to the natural numbers, that is\nR#, was axiomatic rather than model-theoretic. The axiomatic approach\nhas also been taken in analysis by McKubre-Jordens and Weber\n(2012). In axiomatising analysis with a base of paraconsistent logic,\ntheir paper pushes Meyer\u2019s approach to arithmetic via R# a long\nway further. These same authors (2017) rework the theory of\nintegration as it was in Archimedes\u2019 hands, which employs the\nmethod of exhaustion, using paraconsistent reasoning. This gives a\nresult \u201cup to inconsistency\u201d, which means that one is able\nto prove \u201cClassical result or contradiction\u201d. The\nclassical result can be then seen to be recapturable by the classical\nmove disjunctive syllogism applied to the classically-false\n(inconsistent) second disjunct.\n\nIt is certainly important and worthy to pursue this direction, but a\nmild caution is entered here: the axiomatic project is a bit different\nfrom inconsistent mathematics. As noted earlier, Meyer in this phase\nwas consistentist \u2013 he sought a consistent theory with an\ninconsistency-tolerant logic. With similar motivation, he was also\nconcerned to try to settle what he called \u201cthe gamma\nproblem\u201d, which was essentially the question of whether the\naxiomatic theory R# could be shown to contain classical Peano\narithmetic as a sub-theory. If this were so, then his proof of\nnontriviality for R# would immediately yield a new proof of the\nnegation consistency of classical Peano arithmetic! Note that this\nwould not be contrary to Godel\u2019s Second Theorem, since\npresumably the proof of the gamma result would not be confined to\nfinitary techniques. (In the case of Meyer\u2019s theory, it turned\nout to be not so.)\n\nThere have proved to be many places throughout analysis where there\nare distinctive inconsistent insights. The examples in the remainder\nof this section are drawn from Mortensen (1995). For example: (1)\nRobinson\u2019s (1974) non-standard analysis was based on\ninfinitesimals, quantities smaller than any real number, as well as\ntheir reciprocals, the infinite numbers. This has an inconsistent\nversion, which has some advantages for calculation in being able to\ndiscard higher-order infinitesimals. Interestingly, the theory of\ndifferentiation turned out to have these advantages, while the theory\nof integration did not. A similar result, using a different background\nlogic, was obtained by Da Costa (2000). (2) Another place to find\napplications of inconsistency in analysis is topology, where one\nreadily observes the practice of cutting and pasting spaces being\ndescribed as \u201cidentification\u201d of one boundary with\nanother. One can show that this can be described in an inconsistent\ntheory in which the two boundaries are both identical and not\nidentical, and it can be further argued that this is the most natural\ndescription of the practice. (3) Yet another application is the class\nof inconsistent continuous functions. Not all functions which are\nclassically discontinuous are amenable of inconsistent treatment; but\nsome are, for example f(x)=0 for all x<0\nand f(x)=1 for all x\u22650. The inconsistent\nextension replaces the first < by \u2264, and has distinctive\nstructural properties. These inconsistent functions may well have some\napplication in dynamic systems in which there are discontinuous jumps,\nsuch as quantum measurement systems. Differentiating such functions\nleads to the delta functions, applied by Dirac to the study of quantum\nmeasurement. (4) Next, there is the well-known case of inconsistent\nsystems of linear equations, such as the system (i)\nx+y=1, plus (ii) x+y=2. Such\nsystems can potentially arise within the context of automated control.\nLittle work has been done classically to solve such systems, but it\ncan be shown that there are well-behaved solutions within inconsistent\nvector spaces. (5) Finally, one can note a further application in\ntopology and dynamics. Given a supposition which seems to be\nconceivable, namely that whatever happens or is true, happens or is\ntrue on an open set of (spacetime) points, one has that the logic of\ndynamically possible paths is open set logic, that is to say\nintuitionist logic, which supports incomplete theories par excellence.\nThis is because the natural account of the negation of a proposition\nin such a space says that it holds on the largest open set contained\nin the Boolean complement of the set of points on which the original\nproposition held, which is in general smaller than the Boolean\ncomplement. However, specifying a topological space by its closed sets\nis every bit as reasonable as specifying it by its open sets. Yet the\nlogic of closed sets is known to be paraconsistent, ie. supports\ninconsistent nontrivial theories; see Goodman (1981), for example.\nThus given the (alternative) supposition which also seems to be\nconceivable, namely that whatever is true is true on a closed set of\npoints, one has that inconsistent theories may well hold. This is\nbecause the natural account of the negation of a proposition, namely\nthat it holds on the smallest closed set containing the Boolean\nnegation of the proposition, means that on the overlapping boundary\nboth the proposition and its negation hold. Thus dynamical theories\ndetermine their own logic of possible propositions, and corresponding\ntheories which may be inconsistent, and are certainly as natural as\ntheir incomplete counterparts.\n\nOn closed set logic and boundaries as a natural setting for\ncontradictory theories, see Mortensen (2003, 2010). Weber and Cotnoir\n(2015) also explore the inconsistency of boundaries, arising from the\nincompatibility of the three principles (i) there are boundaries, (ii)\nspace is topologically connected, and (iii) discrete entities can be\nin contact (i.e., no space between them). This is a very interesting\nproblem, as all three are plausible; in particular there do seem to be\nboundaries in our world. An initially surprising feature of this\naccount is that boundaries come out as \u201cempty\u201d; after all,\nnull entities are contrary to the spirit of mereology. But this is not\nso shocking as it turns out that they are only empty in the sense that\nthey have members inconsistently.\n\nCategory theory throws light on many mathematical structures. It has\ncertainly been proposed as an alternative foundation for mathematics.\nSuch generality inevitably runs into problems similar to those of\ncomprehension in set theory; see, e.g., Hatcher 1982 (pp.\n255\u2013260). Hence there is the same possible application of\ninconsistent solutions. There is also an important collection of\ncategorial structures, the toposes, which support open set logic in\nexact parallel to the way sets support Boolean logic. This has been\ntaken by many to be a vindication of the foundational point of view of\nmathematical intuitionism. However, it can be proved that that toposes\nsupport closed set logic as readily as they support open set logic, to\ndate the only category-theoretic semantics for a paraconsistent logic.\nThis should not be viewed as an objection to intuitionism, however, so\nmuch as an argument that inconsistent theories are equally reasonable\nas items of mathematical study. See Mortensen (1995 Chap 11, co-author\nLavers). This position has now been taken up, extended and ably\ndefended by Estrada-Gonz\u00e1lez (2010, 2015a, 2015b). The same author\n(2016) undertakes to provide a category-theoretic description of\ntrivial theories, with the aim of showing that triviality is not such\nan uninteresting feature for mathematical theories to have. The\npresent author remains unconvinced, since a trivial theory is surely\nuseless for mathematical calculation; but the ingenuity of the\narguments must be conceded.\n\nDuality between incompleteness/intuitionism and\ninconsistency/paraconsistency has at least two aspects. First there is\nthe above topological (open/closed) duality. Second there is Routley *\nduality. The Routley Star * of a set of sentences S, is\ndefined as S* =df {A:\n~A is not in S}. Discovered by the Routleys (1972)\nas a semantical tool for relevant logics, the * operation dualises\nbetween inconsistent and incomplete theories of the large natural\nclass of de Morgan logics. For example, starring Peano arithmetic\ngives a deductively-closed inconsistent complete non-trivial classical\narithmetical theory containing all of PA, which presents an\ninteresting challenge for the Godel incompleteness results, see\nMortensen (2013). Both kinds of duality interact as well, where the *\ngives distinctive duality and invariance theorems for open set and\nclosed set arithmetical theories. On the basis of these results, it is\nfair to argue that both kinds of mathematics, intuitionist and\nparaconsistent, are equally reasonable.\n4. Geometrical Inconsistency\n\nA geometrical development is the application to explaining the\nphenomenon of inconsistent pictures. The best known of these are\nperhaps M. C. Escher\u2019s masterpieces Belvedere,\nWaterfall and Ascending and Descending. In fact the\ntradition goes back millennia to Pompeii. Escher seems to have derived\nmany of his intuitions from the Swedish artist Oscar Reutersv\u00e4rd,\nwho began his inconsistent work in 1934. Escher also actively\ncollaborated with the English mathematician Roger Penrose. There have\nbeen several attempts to describe the mathematical structure of\ninconsistent pictures using classical consistent mathematics, by\ntheorists such as Cowan, Francis and Penrose. As argued in Mortensen\n(1997), however, no consistent mathematical theory can capture the\nsense that one is seeing an impossible thing. Only an inconsistent\ntheory can capture the content of that perception. This amounts to an\nappeal to a cognitive justification of paraconsistency. One can then\nproceed to display inconsistent theories which are candidates for such\ninconsistent contents. There is an analogy with classical mathematics\non this point: projective geometry is a classical consistent\nmathematical theory which is interesting because we are creatures with\nan eye, since it explains why it is that things look the way they do\nin perspective.\n\nInconsistent geometrical studies are further developed in Mortensen\n(2002a), where category theory is applied to give a general\ndescription of the relationships between the various theories and\ntheir consistent cut-downs and incomplete duals. For an informal\naccount which highlights the difference between visual\n\u201cparadoxes\u201d and the philosophically more common paradoxes\nof language, such as the Liar, see Mortensen (2002b).\n\nMore recently, inconsistent mathematical descriptions have been\nobtained for several classes of inconsistent figures, exemplified by\nEscher\u2019s Cube (found in his print Belvedere), the\nReutersv\u00e4rd-Penrose triangle, and others. See Mortensen\n(2010).\n\nThis raises another interesting issue. Ever since Euclid, the method\nof reductio ad absurdum has been thoroughly exploited in geometrical\nproofs (assume he opposite of what you want to prove and deduce a\ncontradiction). But here we have a different technique (employ a\ncontradiction to describe how inconsistent figures look, to\ndemonstrate that the content is genuinely contradictory). If\nsuccessful, this is a demonstration that human conceptualisation\nexceeds the merely possible (consistent). For discussion see Mortensen\n(2019, 2022).\n\nOne more point: do these geometrical paradoxes lend support to full\ndialetheism? The answer is no. If you can draw a contradictory picture\nthen something exists that is inconsistent. And, distinct\ninconsistent figures imply distinctions between types of\ncontradictions which ECQ does not permit. But this should not be\npushed too far. Nothing says that because a picture has a content,\nthat content must somehow be true: many pictures are\nfictional in content. For more on this theme see Mortensen\n(2019a).\n5. Chunk and Permeate\n\nRecently, an alternative technique for dealing generally with\ncontradictions has emerged. Brown and Priest (2004) have proposed a\ntechnique they call \u201cChunk and Permeate\u201d, in which\nreasoning from inconsistent premisses proceeds by separating the\nassumptions into consistent theories (chunks), deriving appropriate\nconsequences, then passing (permeating) those consequences to a\ndifferent chunk for further consequences to be derived. They suggest\nthat Newton\u2019s original reasoning in taking derivates in the\ncalculus, was of this form. This is an interesting and novel approach,\nthough it must meet the objection that to believe a conclusion\nobtained on this basis, one should believe all the premisses equally;\nand so an argument of the more common form, appealing to all the\npremisses without fragmenting them, should be eventually forthcoming.\nThe objection is thus that Chunk and Permeate is part of the context\nof discovery rather than the context of justification.\n\nLater, Benham et. al. (2014) have extended these methods to\nthe Dirac delta function. This broadens the class of applications, and\nso strengthens the technique. However, it also becomes clear there,\nthat there is a close parallel between (one large class of) Chunk and\nPermeate applications, and (consistent) non-standard analysis:\nwherever Chunk and Permeate takes a derivative by shifting chunks to\none where infinitesimals are zero, non-standard analysis takes a\nderivative by defining derivatives to be \u201cstandard parts\nonly\u201d. Of course, equivalence between these two techniques does\nnot show which is explanatorily deeper. Developments are to be awaited\nwith interest.\n6. Conclusion \n\nTo conclude: there has been appearing lately quite a bit of\nphilosophical material, that is sympathetic to the cause of\ninconsistent mathematics. Colyvan (2000) addresses the issue that\ninconsistent mathematical theories imply inconsistent mathematical\nobjects as their subject-matters. He also takes up the important task\nof providing an account of how inconsistent mathematics can have a\nbranch which is applied mathematics. Priest (2013), like\nColyvan, notes that inconsistent mathematics adds to the platonist\nmix. Berto (2007) usefully surveys paradoxes and foundational issues,\nand sets out some of the arithmetical results that bear on important\nphilosophical issues like the Incompleteness Theorems. Van Bendegem\n(2014) pursues the interesting motivation that change is always a\nstate of anomaly, so that always changing implies always anomalous.\nExamples include infinitesimals, complex numbers and infinity. Caution\nshould be adopted over thinking that inconsistency is always\nanomalous, however, if only because it is simply more material for\nmathematical study.\n\nIt should be emphasised again that these structures do not in any way\nchallenge or repudiate existing mathematics, but rather extend our\nconception of what is mathematically possible. This, in turn, sharpens\nthe issue of Mathematical Pluralism; see e.g., Davies (2005), Hellman\nand Bell (2006), or Priest (2013). Various authors have different\nversions of mathematical pluralism, but it is something along the\nlines that incompatible mathematical theories can be equally true. The\ncase for mathematical pluralism rests on the observation that there\nare different mathematical \u201cuniverses\u201d in which different,\nindeed incompatible, mathematical theorems or laws hold. Well-known\nexamples are the incompatibility between classical mathematics and\nintuitionist mathematics, and the incompatibility between ZF-like\nuniverses of sets respectively with, and without, the Axiom of Choice.\nIt seems absurd to say that ZF with Choice is true mathematics and ZF\nwithout Choice is false mathematics, if they are both legitimate\nexamples of mathematically well-behaved theories.\n\nThe primary question for the philosophy of mathematics is surely\nwhat is mathematics. Duality operations like topological\nduality or Routley* reinforce the point that incomplete/inconsistent\nduals are equally reasonable as examples of mathematics. From this\npoint of view, disputes about which of intuitionist or classical or\ninconsistent mathematics to accept seem pointless; they are all part\nof the subject matter of mathematics. This point is made effectively\nby Shapiro (2014, in contrast see his 2002). Shapiro\u2019s\ndistinctive position has other ingredients: mathematics as the science\nof structure, and mathematical pluralism implying logical pluralism\n(on logical pluralism see also Beall and Restall 2006); but we do not\ntake these up here.\n\nFor what it is worth, the present writer thinks that some version of\nmathematical pluralism is obviously true, if one takes mathematics to\nbe firstly about mathematical theories allowing for inconsistency ,\nand only secondly about the objects internal to those theories. There\nis, of course, no problem about incompatible theories co-existing, if\nconsidered as structures of propositions. The primacy of theories\nfits, too, with the natural observation that the epistemology of\nmathematics is deductive proof. It is only if one takes as a starting\npoint the primacy of the mathematical object as the truth-maker of\ntheories, that one has to worry about how their objects manage to\nco-exist.\n",
