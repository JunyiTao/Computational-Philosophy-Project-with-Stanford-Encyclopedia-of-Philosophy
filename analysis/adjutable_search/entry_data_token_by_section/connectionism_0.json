    "main_text": "A Description of Neural Networks\n1. A Description of Neural Networks\n\nA neural network consists of large number of units joined together in\na pattern of connections. Units in a net are usually segregated into\nthree classes: input units, which receive information to be processed,\noutput units where the results of the processing are found, and units\nin between called hidden units. If a neural net were to model the\nwhole human nervous system, the input units would be analogous to the\nsensory neurons, the output units to the motor neurons, and the hidden\nunits to all other neurons. \n\nHere is a simple illustration of a simple neural net:\n\n\n\n\nEach input unit has an activation value that represents some feature\nexternal to the net. An input unit sends its activation value to each\nof the hidden units to which it is connected. Each of these hidden\nunits calculates its own activation value depending on the activation\nvalues it receives from the input units. This signal is then passed on\nto output units or to another layer of hidden units. Those hidden\nunits compute their activation values in the same way, and send them\nalong to their neighbors. Eventually the signal at the input units\npropagates all the way through the net to determine the activation\nvalues at all the output units.\n\nThe pattern of activation set up by a net is determined by the\nweights, or strength of connections between the units. Weights may be\neither positive or negative. A negative weight represents the\ninhibition of the receiving unit by the activity of a sending unit.\nThe activation value for each receiving unit is calculated according a\nsimple activation function. Activation functions vary in detail, but\nthey all conform to the same basic plan. The function sums together\nthe contributions of all sending units, where the contribution of a\nunit is defined as the weight of the connection between the sending\nand receiving units times the sending unit\u2019s activation value.\nThis sum is usually modified further, for example, by adjusting the\nactivation sum to a value between 0 and 1 and/or by setting the\nactivation to zero unless a threshold level for the sum is reached.\nConnectionists presume that cognitive functioning can be explained by\ncollections of units that operate in this way. Since it is assumed\nthat all the units calculate pretty much the same simple activation\nfunction, human intellectual accomplishments must depend primarily on\nthe settings of the weights between the units.\n\nThe kind of net illustrated above is called a feed forward net.\nActivation flows directly from inputs to hidden units and then on to\nthe output units. More realistic models of the brain would include\nmany layers of hidden units, and recurrent connections that send\nsignals back from higher to lower levels. Such recurrence is necessary\nin order to explain such cognitive features as short-term memory. In a\nfeed forward net, repeated presentations of the same input produce the\nsame output every time, but even the simplest organisms habituate to\n(or learn to ignore) repeated presentation of the same stimulus.\nConnectionists tend to avoid recurrent connections because little is\nunderstood about the general problem of training recurrent nets.\nHowever Elman (1991) and others have made some progress with simple\nrecurrent nets, where the recurrence is tightly constrained.\n",
