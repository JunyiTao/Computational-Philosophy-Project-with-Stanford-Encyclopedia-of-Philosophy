    "main_text": "Ontological Dependence and Metaphysical Grounding\n5. Ontological Dependence and Metaphysical Grounding\n\nThe notion of \u201cground\u201d stormed into contemporary analytic\nmetaphysics in the beginning of the twenty-first century, but the\nroots of the notion go back to Aristotle (for an overview, see Fine\n2012). Sometimes grounding is understood as \u201cmetaphysical\nexplanation\u201d. To be more precise, when some x is grounded\nin some y, it is usually thought that y explains\nx, and grounding either is that explanatory relationship or\n\u2018backs\u2019 that explanation (there is a lot of debate on\nthese issues, see the separate entry on\n metaphysical grounding).\n Moreover, the status of y is generally thought to be somehow\nprior to that of x\u2014grounding is typically\nunderstood to express priority between things. For instance, we might\nsay that the members of a set are prior to the set itself; the\nexistence of the set is grounded in its members. Or to take a more\nconcrete example, the existence of any given composite object is\ngrounded in the existence of its parts. For instance, we might suggest\nthat the existence of any given water molecule is grounded in the\nexistence of hydrogen and oxygen atoms. Somewhat more controversially,\nwe might also say that mental states are grounded in physical states.\nIn each of the mentioned examples there appears to be an ontological\ndependence relation between the grounded entity and the grounding\nentity or entities. In fact, we have already discussed some of these\nexamples in terms of ontological dependence above. This naturally\nleads one to question whether grounding just is (a variety of)\nontological dependence\u2014or whether ontological dependence is\ngrounding. One motivation for finding a systematic link between\nontological dependence and grounding is that it would be more\nparsimonious than having two primitive notions (for discussion, see\nCorreia & Schnieder 2012b).\n\nAn initial reason to distinguish ontological dependence and\nmetaphysical grounding is that the latter is a much stricter notion.\nConsider the idea that ontological dependence could be reflexive:\nthere is nothing in theory that rules out a relation of ontological\ndependence obtaining in such a way that a given object is dependent on\nitself. It is of course controversial whether there actually are any\nsuch entities, but this is not enough to consider irreflexivity as a\nnecessary requirement for ontological dependence. In contrast,\nmetaphysical grounding is usually considered to be necessarily\nirreflexive (of course, there are those who think that this\nrequirement could be dropped in the case of grounding just like it may\nin the case of ontological dependence; see, e.g., Jenkins 2011).\n\nA more general issue concerns the modal implications of each notion.\nIn particular, is there a form of ontological dependence that is both\nnecessary and sufficient for grounding? This seems unlikely (as argued\nin Ryd\u00e9hn forthcoming). While there are some instances of\ngrounding which are clearly rigid in the same sense as rigid\nexistential dependence, it is also clear that this connection is not\nnecessary and sufficient. Take for instance the fact [f] and assume\nthat it is fully grounded in [g]. This entails that [f] cannot be\ngrounded except by [g]. An example would be the case of the set of\nsingleton Socrates, whose existence is rigidly grounded in the fact\nthat Socrates exists. In such cases, [f] rigidly existentially depends\nupon [g], and it is also plausible that [f] depends for its identity\nupon [g]. However, other instances of grounding do not require that\nthe grounded fact rigidly depends upon its grounds. For example,\nsuppose that [f] is the fact that a particular subject is feeling\npain, and that [f] is fully grounded in a particular neural fact about\nthis subject, [g]. It seems possible that this subject could have been\nin pain, so [f] could have obtained, even if [g] did not obtain. This\nwould be the case if [f] had been grounded in a different neural fact,\n[h]. In this case, [f] cannot depend for its identity upon [g], since\n[f] is not rigidly dependent upon [g]. This rules out some simple\noptions for linking grounding and rigid ontological dependence, but\nthere are arguably also problems for linking it with generic varieties\nof ontological dependence (for a more detailed discussion, see\nRyd\u00e9hn forthcoming).\n\nIf grounding cannot be easily analyzed with the help of rigid or\ngeneric dependence, then we might instead suggest that if grounding\nwere to be understood as a type of ontological dependence, it would be\nsome sort of explanatory dependence. The idea that whatever\ndoes the grounding also somehow explains what is being\ngrounded is a crucial part of the notion\u2019s appeal. Relations of\nontological dependence often seem to have a similar type of\nexplanatory role, but the link to explanation may appear weaker: even\nthough the existence of water depends on the existence of hydrogen and\noxygen, it does not seem to be the case that the existence of hydrogen\nand oxygen explain the existence of water. Rather, what\nexplains the existence of water is the ability of hydrogen and oxygen\natoms to form molecules (even though this is rather simplified). So\nthere are at least some difficulties in accounting for all relations\nof ontological dependence in terms of grounding relations.\n\nWe need something stricter than just \u201can explanatory role\u201d\nto identify grounding\u2014otherwise we would end up with a much too\nliberal notion, for we may regard a number of loosely connected things\nexplanatory in some very loose sense. For instance, we might say that\nthe fact that Smith murdered Jones is explained by certain events in\nSmith\u2019s childhood, but a more direct explanation might be\nSmith\u2019s desire to rob Jones. Certain events in Smith\u2019s\nchildhood may help us understand why Smith has murderous\ndesires, but it\u2019s not clear that they serve to ground the fact\nthat Smith murdered Jones (unless we can establish transitivity\nbetween these).\n\nOne suggestion that may help to make grounding more precise would be\nto focus on priority. To reiterate an example used above, if\nthe members of a set are prior to the set itself, then the existence\nof the set is grounded in its members. So the grounding entities are\nprior to\u2014or more fundamental than\u2014the grounded\nentities. Metaphors abound, but a typical way to express the idea is\nto say that x is fundamental or ontologically independent in\nthis sense if and only if nothing grounds x (Schaffer 2009:\n373). This is another sense in which grounding would seem to come\napart from certain types of ontological dependence, as a purely\nmodal-existential understanding of dependence in the lines of\n (EDR)\n (if one accepts them), without any claim to priority, is also\npossible. This is of course the sense which we defined above in terms\nof necessitation: even if x rigidly necessitates y that\ndoes not entail that y must be ontologically prior to x.\nAt any rate, it would be odd to say that parents are more\nfundamental than their children, even if there is a (temporally\nrelativized) rigid existential dependency between parents and their\nchildren.\n\nAll this would appear to suggest that it isn\u2019t straightforward\nto define grounding simply as a variety of ontological dependence, or\nthe other way around. In any case, even if we could define one notion\nin terms of the other, it seems that there are aspects of ontological\ndependence that are not captured by all accounts of grounding as well\nas aspects of grounding that are not captured by all accounts of\nontological dependence. The situation may of course change depending\non one\u2019s preferred account of dependence and grounding.\nAccordingly, for the time being, it is advisable to keep the notions\napart, especially since there are some further, formal differences\nthat need to be taken into account. In particular, grounding is most\ncommonly understood as a strict partial order (see Raven\n2013), which entails irreflexivity, transitivity, and asymmetry. If\nthis is correct, grounding could only capture a very specific variety\nof ontological dependence, as we have seen that there are varieties of\nontological dependence that violate these formal features. Some have\nalso argued that grounding itself violates all or some of these formal\nfeatures, so it is not entirely uncontroversial that grounding truly\nis a strict partial ordering (for discussion, see Jenkins 2011,\nSchaffer 2012, and Tahko 2013). Given this, the exact link between\ngrounding and ontological dependence remains open, subject to further\nspecification of the formal features of ground.\n",
