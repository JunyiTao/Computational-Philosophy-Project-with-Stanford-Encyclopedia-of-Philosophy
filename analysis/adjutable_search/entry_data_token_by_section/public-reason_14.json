    "main_text": "Objections || Truth\n7.3 Truth\n\nMany accounts of public reason, most notably Rawls\u2019s, recommend\nthat we assess moral and political rules while abstaining, in several\nways, from claims about truth. On Rawls\u2019s account, for example,\nphilosophical theories of the truth are the sort of thing over which\nreasonable people are assumed to disagree, and so an account of public\nreason cannot purport to deliver moral or political principles that\nare \u201ctrue\u201d according to some particular philosophical\nconception of truth; rather it can only deliver principles that are\n\u201creasonable\u201d (Rawls 1996, 94). Many accounts of public\nreason also tell citizens that they must refrain, when engaged in\npublic reasoning with others, from appealing to the whole\ntruth as they see it. Regardless of what you may believe is true\nabout religion or the good life, citizens must abstain from appeals to\nsuch truths, and instead appeal only to those public or political\nconsiderations that can be endorsed by other reasonable members of the\nmoral or political community.\n\nThese two ways in which public reason limits appeals to truth generate\nseveral distinct objections. First, some worry that if a system of\nmoral or political justification ignores the whole truth, the\nresulting moral or political principles may be false. For example, if\nit is true that all sinners will go to hell when they die, but we are\nprecluded from appealing to this truth in developing our political\nprinciples, we may endorse a political principle that permits people\nto engage in various sinful activities. If we could appeal to the\nwhole truth about hell, however, we would see that this political\nprinciple is false. Others worry that without some appeal to truth,\nany agreement on political principles will amount to a mere modus\nvivendi (Hampton 1989, 806\u201307). A related worry\u2014that\nprecluding the appeal to certain truths will render us unable to solve\ncertain problems\u2014is considered in section 7.3 below.\n\nSecond, we might worry that if an account of moral or political\njustification seeks to validate conclusions without contradicting\nanything that a diverse group of people believe to be true\u2014for\nexample, without contradicting anyone\u2019s reasonable religious\nviews\u2014such an account will be \u201ccommitted to the view that\nit is desirable to propagate false beliefs or unsound\ninferences\u201d (Raz 1998, 42).\n\nThird, some critics focus on Rawls\u2019s claim that the content of\npublic reason\u2014the principles of a political conception of\njustice\u2014can be presented as merely reasonable, but not true. If\nthese principles are merely reasonable, but not presented as true,\nthen why should individuals accord these principles priority in their\ndecisions about how to behave, particularly when these principles come\ninto conflict with religious or other requirements that individuals\nbelieve to be true, and not merely reasonable (Raz 1990, 23)?\n\nFourth, it might seem that public reason cannot successfully abstain\nfrom some claims about moral or political truth. In order to explain\nwhy we ought to accept a principle of public reason or public\njustification, we cannot simply say it ought to be accepted because\nthe principle itself can be publicly justified. Such a claim might be\ntrivially true\u2014its truth established by restricting the\nconstituency of public reason to those who endorse the idea of public\nreason\u2014but this does not vindicate the principle, nor does it\ndistinguish a principle of public reason from similarly\n\u201cinsular\u201d principles that appear clearly dubious, for\nexample, a principle mandating that moral principles are valid only\nwhen endorsed by Albert, who also happens to endorse this principle\ngranting him exclusive moral authority (Estlund 1998).\n\nFifth, other critics have suggested that the idea of public reason\nentails that individuals must doubt, or be skeptical about, their\nreligious or otherwise nonpublic beliefs (Barry 1995, 901\u2013914;\nMcCabe 2000, 316\u2013324; Wall 1998, 91\u201394; Wenar 1995,\n41\u201348), or at least must accept that their nonpublic beliefs can\nbe disputed by fully competent reasoners (Leland and van Wietmarschen\n2012). Some argue this is entailed by the Rawlsian appeal to the\nburdens of judgment or the fact of reasonable pluralism (see sect. 3).\nOthers claim that only if we were skeptical about the truth of our\nnonpublic beliefs would it make sense to bracket those beliefs when\ndeliberating about moral and political matters. If skepticism is\nentailed for either of these reasons, this poses two potential\nproblems. One is that this looks to be the sort of controversial\nepistemological view that Rawls and others want to avoid in\nconstructing an account of public reason. The other is that many\notherwise apparently reasonable and well-motivated people are not\nskeptical about their religious or nonpublic beliefs, but then does\nthis mean such people cannot endorse the idea of public reason? These\nworries lead some to conclude that there is no coherent way to explain\nhow reasonable persons can (a) accept something like the fact of\nreasonable pluralism, (b) believe her own non-public doctrine is true,\nand (c) be suitably motivated to endorse a principle of public reason\n(Enoch 2017).\n\nProponents of public reason have offered various responses to the\nobjections described above. First, and most generally, not all\nconceptions of public reason purport to do without the concept of\ntruth entirely, in the way that Rawls\u2019s particular account aims\nto do. Second, even those who endorse Rawls\u2019s account, or one\nsimilar to it, argue that it can meet the objections pressed against\nit. According to some, this is because it is a mistake to suppose that\na theory of public reason or political justification must also justify\nthe deliberative priority of its conclusions. On this view, it is up\nto individuals to decide whether, and why, to accord to deliberative\npriority to the conclusions of public reason. If deliberative priority\nis not something a theory of public reason should be expected to\nsupply, the third, fourth, and fifth objections above can be defused\n(Quong 2011, 221\u2013242). Third, proponents of public reason point\nout that when methods of justification require participants to refrain\nfrom appealing to the whole truth, this does not entail the\nconclusions reached will not be true, or that the method is somehow\nindifferent with regard to the truth of the conclusions reached\n(Mendus 2002, 26\u201328; Rawls 1996, 150). Certain appeals to\ntruth\u2014for example, hearsay\u2014are not permitted in a\ncourtroom, but this does not show that we are unconcerned with the\ntruth of the conclusions we reach in criminal trials. Fourth, and\nrelatedly, in contexts when we aim at truth or justification, we also\nrecognize the importance of other considerations and allow these\nconsiderations to constrain the means by which truth is pursued, for\nexample, spouses cannot be required to testify against one another\n(Freeman 2007, 233\u2013235; Rawls 1996, 218). Finally, some might\nargue, following Rawls, that we do not need to affirm any given\npolitical principle or rule as true, only as the most reasonable one\navailable in light of our commitment to certain public political\nvalues; this is sufficient to show why we ought to endorse the\nprinciple or rule in question, at least insofar as we see ourselves as\nreasonable citizens.\n",
