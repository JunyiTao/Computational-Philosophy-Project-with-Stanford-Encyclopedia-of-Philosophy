    "main_text": "Social Philosophy, The Negro Problem, and Race || What is the Negro Problem?\n2.1 What is the Negro Problem?\n\nDu Bois considers the Negro Problem both objectively and\nsubjectively\u2014both from the standpoint of science and from the\nstandpoint of lived experience.\n2.1.1 The Negro Problem Objectively Considered\n\nIn \u201cThe Study of the Negro Problems\u201d (1898), one of his\nearliest publications, Du Bois responded to then contemporary\ndiscussions of America\u2019s \u201cNegro problem\u201d by\nconceptualizing the problem as an object of social scientific inquiry.\nSociology studies social phenomena, and the social phenomena that\ninterest Du Bois are the cluster of social problems affecting American\nNegroes (the Negro is not a problem, in his view, although problems\naffect the Negro [see Gordon, 2000]). In the perspective of sociology,\nthe Negro problem just is a cluster of social problems (1898,\n 77\u201378).[2]\n But what is a social\n problem?[3]\n\nDu Bois answers this question by defining a social problem as\n\u201cthe failure of an organized social group to realize its group\nideals, through the inability to adapt a certain desired line of\naction to given conditions of life\u201d (1898, 78). One example is\nthe failure to enact the ideal of a luxurious home life due to\nprevailing marriage customs. Another is the failure to enact the ideal\nof economic and social development due to crime and lawlessness.\n\nThe historical evolution of the social problems that Du Bois\nidentifies as Negro problems has been a \u201cbaffling adjustment of\naction and condition which is the essence of progress\u201d (1898,\n 82).[4]\n Turning to the present, Du Bois characterizes the then current (circa\n1898) Negro problems as so many failures to enact the ideal of\nincorporating the Negro masses into the group life of the American\npeople. Du Bois attributes these failures to two causes: white racial\nprejudice towards Negroes and Negro cultural backwardness. Racial\nprejudice is the conviction \u201cthat people of Negro blood should\nnot be admitted into the group life of the nation no matter what their\ncondition may be\u201d (1898, 82). Cultural backwardness is economic\ndisadvantage, ignorance, and deficiency with regard to the art of\norganized social life. Each of these causes accounts for one of two\ndistinct classes of Negro problems (1898,\n 82\u20133).[5]\n\nDu Bois\u2019s social ontology and causal explanation of Negro\nproblems lay the basis for his research agenda. The study of the Negro\nas a social group focuses on Negro problems that have arisen\nindependently of racial prejudice in the Negro\u2019s social\nenvironment. In turn, the study of the Negro\u2019s social\nenvironment considers Negro problems that have resulted from\nracial prejudice. Du Bois\u2019s program for studying the Negro as a\nsocial group includes historical study, statistical investigation,\nanthropological measurement, and sociological\n interpretation.[6]\n2.1.2 The Negro Problem Subjectively Considered\n\nIn Du Bois\u2019s view, the Negro Problem is a subjectively lived and\nfelt social condition, not only an object of social scientific\ninquiry. In \u201cStrivings of the Negro People\u201d (1897b) and\nThe Souls of Black Folk (1903a), Du Bois adduces the concept\nof double-consciousness to characterize the subjectively lived and\nfelt experience of the Negro problem. Ascribing double consciousness\nspecifically to the Negro, Du Bois characterizes it as a \u201csense\nof always looking at oneself through the eyes of others, of measuring\none\u2019s soul by the tape of a world that looks on in amused\ncontempt and pity\u201d (1903a, 3). In Du Bois\u2019s view,\ndouble-consciousness obtains when blacks see themselves through the\npitying and contemptuous eyes of the racially prejudiced whites whose\nracial prejudice is one of the causes of the Negro problem.\n\nThe concept of double-consciousness is the most extensively discussed\nconcept in the humanities and social sciences secondary literature on\nDu Bois, and it has received substantial attention from philosophers.\nThe present, brief discussion of the concept is intended simply to\nsituate it within the larger context of Du Bois\u2019s social\nphilosophy. For a more detailed account of Du Bois\u2019s\nunderstanding of double consciousness and a survey of contemporary\nphilosophical disputes about the content and significance of the\nconcept, see the entry on\n double consciousness.\n",
