    "main_text": "\n\nChinese philosophy was developed on the basis of ontological,\nepistemological and metaphysical paradigms that differ from those of\nWestern theoretical discourses. The concepts and categories used in\nChinese philosophy cannot be easily transferred from one\nsocio-cultural context into another, and it is often difficult to\nunderstand this philosophy through the lens of traditional Western\nthought. The exclusive application of Western methods can thus lead to\nsevere misunderstandings and false interpretations of Chinese\ndiscourses. It is therefore important to use caution so as not to\ndiminish the richness and depth of Chinese thought or turn it into a\nweak version of Western philosophical thought.\n\nThe epistemological dimensions of Chinese texts and their role in the\ncontext of Chinese thought has been developed increasingly\nsuccessfully under the aegis of rediscovering and applying specific\ntraditional Chinese methodological approaches and categories (Lenk and\nPaul 1993). The present entry similarly explores Chinese epistemology\nthrough the lens of conceptual and ideational assets created and\ndeveloped in the Chinese tradition (Creller 2014: 196).\n\nAccording to the prevailing traditional European epistemologies,\nknowledge has mainly been gained through observation and reasoning.\nHowever, in traditional Chinese thought, knowledge has been understood\nin a much broader sense, namely as something which also (or primarily)\nstems from moral contents and which cannot be separated from (social)\npractice. The method which determined most of the epistemological\nteachings found in the Chinese classics was based on a holistic world\nview, and was directed towards a comprehension which could be achieved\nthrough education and learning. The basic contents of these teachings\nwere rooted in the premises of pragmatic and utilitarian ethics.\nChinese epistemology was relational (Ro\u0161ker 2012), meaning that\nit understood the external world to be ordered as a network of\nrelations, forming a dynamic structure. The human mind was also\nstructured in accordance with this cosmic all-embracing organic system\n(li \u7406). The relational cor\u00adre\u00adspon\u00addence and mutual compatibility\nbetween the cosmic and mental structures thus represents the basic\nprecondition of human perception and comprehension.\n\nThis entry will provide a systematic overview of the special features,\nthe central methods and the main developmental streams of classical\nChinese epistemological discourses that were based on a structurally\nordered holistic worldview and rooted in axiological premises.\n",
