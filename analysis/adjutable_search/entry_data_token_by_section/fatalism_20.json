Theological Fatalism: Molina, Plantinga and middle knowledge\n\nSome philosophers, notably Luis de Molina (1535\u20131600) and Alvin\nPlantinga, have held that God knows not only what actual people will\nfreely do in the future, but what each possible free creature would\nhave freely done in each set of possible circumstances, if fully\nspecific; and that he had this knowledge at the creation. (An action\nis free in the required sense if not causally determined and not\npredetermined by God.) Propositions about what a creature would do in\na set of circumstances (possible as well as actual) are commonly\ncalled \u201ccounterfactuals of freedom\u201d, and God\u2019s\nknowledge of them is called \u201cmiddle knowledge\u201d (Molina,\nOn Divine Foreknowledge (Part IV of the Concordia); Plantinga\n1974, IX).\n\nIf God\u2019s knowledge of actual future actions would constitute a\nfatalistic threat, his middle knowledge could not be less threatening,\nsince, given middle knowledge, he would have knowledge of actual\nactions on the basis of his knowledge of the circumstances. In fact it\nseems that it is more threatening.\n\nOf course, one way of avoiding the threat would be to deny that there\nare in general any facts about what people would have freely done in\ncircumstances that have not actually arisen; there may be facts about\nwhat they might have done, or what they would very probably have done;\nbut not what they would have done (Adams 1977; Hasker 1989,\n20\u20139). Indeed this seems to be quite plausible if we really\nthink of people\u2019s actions as undetermined. It may help us to see\nthis if we consider the tossing of a coin. Let us suppose that a coin\nis tossed on some occasion, and it comes down heads; and suppose we\nthen ask if it would have come down heads again if we had tossed it\nagain in exactly the same circumstances. It seems plausible, if we\nthink that how it landed was undetermined, that the right answer is\nthat it might have come down heads and it might have come down tails,\nbut that it is not the case that it would have come down heads, nor\nthe case that it would have come down tails.\n\nSo one solution to the fatalistic threat posed by middle knowledge is\nakin to the Aristotelian solution. Since there are no facts of the\nrelevant sort, God cannot have knowledge of them. But, because there\nare no such facts, God\u2019s lack of knowledge of how free creatures\nwould freely act is no bar to his omniscience.\n\nAre there any other solutions?\n\nIt is difficult to see how there could be. In the case of actual\nactions, the solutions depended on suggesting ways in which it might\nhave been possible for Jones to do something which would bring it\nabout that some fact about God was different; that is to say that they\ndepended on showing how some fact about God might be dependent on what\nJones did. Now in the case of middle knowledge we know how such a\ndependence would have to operate; it would have to operate by way of\nGod\u2019s knowledge of counterfactuals of freedom. So, could the\ntruth of counterfactuals of freedom related to Jones be dependent on\nJones\u2019s actions? It seems that they could not be, because the\nfacts that make them true were available to God at the creation,\nbefore he had decided to create anything, let alone Jones. So the\nfacts, like God\u2019s decision, must have been ontologically prior,\nit seems, to any act of Jones\u2019s. So it seems that it could not\nbe in Jones\u2019s power so to act that any actually true\ncounterfactual of freedom relating to him would not have been true\n(Hasker 1989, 39\u201352; see Hasker et al. 2000 for a collection of\nwritings on middle knowledge).\n",
