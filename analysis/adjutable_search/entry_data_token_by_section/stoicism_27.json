    "main_text": "Ethics || Oikei\u00f4sis\n4.6 Oikei\u00f4sis\n\nTo support their account of cosmopolitan justice and their fundamental\naxiological thesis that only virtue is good, the Stoics rely on their\ndoctrine of oikei\u00f4sis (\u201cappropriation\u201d or\n\u201caffiliation\u201d; the Greek term suggests a process whereby\nobjects come to be recognized as oikeion \u2013 as\n\u201cappropriate\u201d or \u201caffiliated\u201d or\n\u201cbelonging\u201d to the creature in question). This doctrine\nbegins with the observation that, straight from birth, every creature\nseeks to preserve its own constitution, even when this is painful\n(Diogenes Laertius, 57A; Seneca, 57B): its own constitution is thus\nthe first thing each creature sees as oikeion to it and,\nhence, as an object of concern. This is because each animal is born\nwith a capacity for self-perception, which enables it to detect, among\nother things, what is appropriate or harmful to its constitution, and\na capacity for impulse, which enables it to pursue or avoid objects\naccordingly (Hierocles, 57C). So, to use Seneca\u2019s example, a\nturtle that has fallen on its back perceives that this situation is\nunfavorable to its constitution and forms an impulse to right itself.\nMoreover, the turtle does all this by nature, without having been\ntrained to do so, showing that non-rational creatures are set-up by\nprovidential nature to perceive what is needed for their own\nteleological success and to act appropriately in pursuit of this goal.\nNewborn infants and children are no exception: as we saw above\n (2.9),\n humans are not born with reason but rather acquire it later in life,\nso that prior to maturing into adults we employ a non-rational soul\nand pursue the objects appropriate for a constitution of this kind.\nThe transition into adulthood comes when \u201creason supervenes as\nthe craftsman of impulse\u201d (Diogenes Laertius, 57A), i.e., when\nwe acquire a rational nature and begin to form \u201crational\nimpulses\u201d (Stobaeus, 53Q). The Stoics maintain that the rational\nconstitution of a mature adult differs from that of a non-rational\nchild (Seneca, 57B), and so too the things favorable to it.\nFurthermore, adding a social dimension to the theory of\noikei\u00f4sis, the Stoics observe that humans, like members\nof certain animal species (bees, ants, etc.), naturally cooperate with\none another, and, in general, \u201cit could not be consistent for\nnature both to desire the production of offspring and not to be\nconcerned that offspring should be loved\u201d (Cicero, 57F).\nHowever, it is not exactly clear how these various observations are\nsupposed to offer support for the Stoics\u2019 ethical commitments.\nScholarly debate has focused on three main issues. First, how, if at\nall, are these apparently descriptive claims able to provide any\nnormative guidance? Second, how could a natural disposition toward\nself-preservation underwrite the other-regarding demands of\ncosmopolitan justice? Third, in what ways, if any, is a non-rational\ncreature\u2019s pursuit of food, shelter, and other things favorable\nto their non-rational constitution analogous to the Sage\u2019s\nattachment to virtue as the sole good? It is worth noting that one of\nour main sources on oikei\u00f4sis concludes with an account\nof the ideal agent\u2019s development, culminating in her\nappreciation that consistency [or agreement, homologia] and\nharmony of conduct is the only true source of benefit in a human life\n(Cicero, 59D). Magrin 2018 and Klein 2016 take up these issues with\nadmirable clarity and should be consulted for further details; they\nalso provide an up-to-date bibliography on this wide-ranging\ntopic.\n",
