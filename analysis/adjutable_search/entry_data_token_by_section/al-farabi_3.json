    "main_text": "Mathematics and Music\n4. Mathematics and Music\n\nAfter logic comes mathematics. For al-F\u00e2r\u00e2b\u00ee\nmathematical sciences include arithmetic, geometry, optics, astronomy,\nmusic, the science of weights and mechanics. Only recently has more\nattention be paid to this aspect of Farabian thought. Gad Freudenthal\n(1988) focused on al-F\u00e2r\u00e2b\u00ee\u2019s views on\ngeometry. Except for pointing to al-F\u00e2r\u00e2b\u00ee\u2019s\nrejection, in contradistinction to al-Kind\u00ee, of the validity of\nwhat we now call astrology, scholars had neglected his views on\nastronomy and cosmology. Damien Janos\u2019s Method, Structure,\nand Development in al-F\u00e2r\u00e2b\u00ee\u2019s Cosmology\n(2012) has filled this gap. His book throws new light on various\naspects of al-F\u00e2r\u00e2b\u00ee\u2019s astronomy, cosmology,\nand philosophy of nature. It also highlights the link between\ncosmology and metaphysics. Johannes Thomann (2010\u201311) pointed to\na newly discovered commentary on the Almagest attributed to\nal-F\u00e2r\u00e2b\u00ee (Ms. Tehran Maglis 6531).\n\nIn the Enumeration al-F\u00e2r\u00e2b\u00ee follows the\ntraditional classification of music under mathematics. In The\nGreat Book of Music he certainly indicates that music derives\nsome of its principles from mathematics but he also insists, as we\nsaid above, on the importance of performance for determining its\nempirical principles. On some points the ear, rather than theoretical\nreflections, is the ultimate judge, even if at times the ear\ncontradicts some mathematical principle. For instance, he is well\naware that a semitone is not exactly the half of a tone. Of The\nGreat book of Music there exists only one full translation, that\nof Rodolphe d\u2019Erlanger into French (originally published in\n1930\u201335 before the Arabic text was edited; reprint 2001). Only\npartial English translations exist. I referred to two of them: one in\nthe section on language and one in the logic section under poetics.\nGeorge Dimitri Sawa (2009) translated the two chapters on rhythm.\nAlison Laywine (McGill University), both a philosopher with excellent\nknowledge of Greek musical theories and a \u2018Oud player, is\npreparing a full English translation of this complex and lengthy text.\nYet, The Great Book is not the only text\nal-F\u00e2r\u00e2b\u00ee dedicated to music. After having written\nit, dissatisfied with his explanation of rhythms, he subsequently\nwrote two shorter texts on rhythms (English translation of both by Sawa\n2009). Apparently al-F\u00e2r\u00e2b\u00ee invented a system of\nnotation for rhythms.  In his Philosophies of Music in Medieval\nIslam Fadlou Shehadi (1995) dedicates his third chapter to\nal-F\u00e2r\u00e2b\u00ee.  Th\u00e9r\u00e8se-Anne Druart (2020) shows how al-Farabi links music to language, logic and even politics.\n",
