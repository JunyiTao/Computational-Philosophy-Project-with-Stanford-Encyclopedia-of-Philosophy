    "main_text": "Philosophical Aspects of Le\u015bniewski\u2019s Logic || Definitions\n4.2 Definitions\n\n \nThe status of definitions in logic and outside it has been\nsurprisingly controversial. Probably the standard view among logicians\nis that of Russell, according to which definitions are mere\nabbreviations whose role is to render complex propositions more easily\nsurveyable by feeble humans. According to this view, when a logician\ndefines, say, conjunction in terms of implication and negation, as\n\n\\[\np \\wedge q =_{df} {\\sim}(p \\rightarrow{\\sim}q)\n\\]\n\n\n \nthis is to be understood as merely a shorter expression substituting\nfor the longer one. In this case the abbreviatory value is negligible,\nbut in the case of some long expressions, such as that for the\nancestral of a relation, or in very many areas of mathematics, it may\nbe considerable. Russell expressed this view somewhat\nover-dramatically by calling a definition an expression of the\nauthor\u2019s will. On this view, a definition cannot be true or false; it\nmay be appropriate or helpful, or not, and there are certain\nproprieties to be observed, such as not having dangling variables in\neither definiens or definiendum, and not trying to define an\nexpression in terms of itself, but beyond this, the methodological\nrequirements on abbreviation are minimal. In many modern logical\nsystems, definitions are said to be confined to the metalanguage only,\nand not to appear in the object language at all.\n\n There is nothing wrong with this view, but it is emphatically not\nthat of Le\u015bniewski. According to him, a definition introduces a\nnew expression into the object language. Again, the proprieties have\nto be respected, and getting these right turns out to be a tricky\nmatter. Also, it is up to the author of a logical system as to which\ndefinitions he or she chooses to introduce. But there is an important\ndifference. Since definitions add new expressions to the object\nlanguage, they add expressions in places where they can be quantified,\nand so can enhance the system\u2019s expressive power. Le\u015bniewski\nadmits this option: according to him it is the logician\u2019s job to keep\nadding to the system. If in the process, new things are provable that\nwere not provable before, so much the better, provided the proprieties\nare respected. If we can prove a theorem not containing a defined\nexpression after a definition has been introduced that could\nnot be proved before, the definition is said to be\ncreative. Most logicians decry creative definitions:\nLe\u015bniewski embraced them. Le\u015bniewski contended that the\nsymbol \u2018=Def.\u2019 used by most logicians actually sneaks an\nunrecognized primitive into their work. He thought this of Whitehead\nand Russell, and it is why he wanted to formulate Protothetic based on\nequivalence alone, since then the same connective is primitive that is\nused for definitions. In his view, definitions are object-language\nequivalences and should be recognized as such. In retrospect we can\nsee that this view was too extreme. There is room for abbreviatory\ndefinitions, and indeed Le\u015bniewski \u201cunofficially\u201d used\none himself, that of the particular quantifier. What Le\u015bniewski\ncalls \u2018definitions\u2019 might better be called\n\u2018definitional axioms\u2019. That these can be added as we go\nalong rather than collected together at the beginning of a logic is\nsimply a feature of his way of doing logic.\n\n Perhaps the most important creative definition used by\nLe\u015bniewski is one from Ontology, due to Tarski in 1921. Is is for\na functor * of category\n \\(\\rN\\langle\\rN\\rangle\\):\n\n\\[\n\\forall AB\\ulcorner A \\isa *(B) \\leftrightarrow \\exists c\\ulcorner A \\isa c \\wedge B \\isa A\\urcorner \\urcorner\n\\]\n\n\n \nwhere \u2018\\(A \\isa *(B)\\)\u2019 can be read as\n\u2018\\(A\\) is the unique \\(B\\)\u2019. It allowed the long\naxiom of Ontology to be replaced by the short one (see below): without\nit, the replacement was not possible.\n",
