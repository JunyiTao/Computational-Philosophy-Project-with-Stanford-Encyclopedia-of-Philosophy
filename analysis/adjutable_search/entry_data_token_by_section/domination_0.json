    "main_text": "Domination: The Basic Idea\n1. Domination: The Basic Idea\n\nThere is, of course, considerable disagreement about what\ndomination really is. Even so, theorists of domination tend to agree\nabout this much: domination is a kind of unconstrained, unjust\nimbalance of power that enables agents or systems to control other\nagents or the conditions of their actions. We can call this \u201cthe\nbasic idea\u201d of domination. The basic idea has the following\ncomponents:\n\nDomination is a kind of power, and usually social\npower\u2014that is, power over other people.\nDomination involves imbalances or asymmetries in power. The\nEnglish domination comes from the Latin dominus. A\ndominus is a master, and mastery represents an extreme of\nsocial power. Masters usually have all but complete control over how\ntheir slaves will act or over the conditions in which they act. As a\nresult, the master/slave relation is often treated as the most obvious\ncase of domination.\nDomination has many forms. Traditional Roman republicanism\nrecognized a distinction between imperium and\ndominium\u2014domination by the state contrasted with\ndomination by private parties (Pettit 1997; 31; 2001: 152ff). The\npower a master has over a slave may be the clearest case of\ndomination, but it is not necessary to have a literal dominus\nin order to be dominated. For example, tyrants over their subjects and\nmen over women in patriarchal societies are also common examples of\ndomination. Combined with the master/slave, these examples are so\ncommon in the literature that we can refer to them together simply as\nthe Paradigms. Failure to explain why the Paradigms count as\ndomination is sometimes considered reason enough to reject a theory of\ndomination (see Lovett 2010, Blunt 2015, and McCammon 2015). Other\nexamples may not manifest the extremes of power we see in the\nParadigms; but it is generally agreed that domination comes in\ndegrees, and that someone may be dominated even if nobody has total\npower over them.\nDominating power is in some sense unconstrained. It is\nup to masters how they will or will not use their power. Such power is\noften described as arbitrary or discretionary; or,\nperhaps, unlimited by the interests of those under its sway; or,\nperhaps, projects only the vision of the world most favorable to the\nempowered while preventing the subjugated from seeing themselves or\nthe world on their own terms. However it is characterized, that claim\nthat domination counts as such because of the absence of some limit\nrecurs in many theories.\nDomination is an unjust or morally illegitimate form of social\npower. Whatever domination turns out to be, it is morally serious. It\nis a complaint (Pettit 2005). To be dominated is typically to have\ncause for indignation and resentment against the dominator or against\ninstitutions that dominate or make domination possible.\n\n\nMuch contemporary disagreement about domination involves competing\nanswers to three questions: (1) Who, or what, can dominate? (2) Is it\npossible to dominate merely by having power with a certain\nstructure, or is domination an exercise or an abuse\nof power? (3) Exercised or unexercised, what kind of power is\ndomination? The remainder of this entry will address each of these\nquestions in turn, then conclude with a survey of how the idea of\ndomination has been used in recent applied ethical theory. It will\nbecome clear as we examine competing answers to these three questions\nthat different theorists have very different ideas of why, exactly, we\nneed a theory of domination. There may be wide agreement that we need\nthe idea of domination to make sense of unjust power relations, but\nunjust power relations are wildly varied, and theorists of domination\ndisagree not only about which varieties most need to be understood,\nbut about how theorizing domination helps us to understand them. \n\nAnother word of qualification before proceeding: what follows is a\nsurvey of work almost entirely from Anglophone political philosophers\nand political theorists, broadly within the Analytic tradition. For\ntheories of domination from the Continental tradition, see the entry,\n feminist perspectives on power.\n",
