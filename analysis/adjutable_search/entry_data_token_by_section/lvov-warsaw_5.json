    "main_text": "Logic || Semantics and truth\n3.4 Semantics and truth\n\nDue to semantic paradoxes, Hilbert\u2019s formalistic metamathematics\nand the syntacticism of the Vienna Circle, the concept of truth was\nexpelled from the domain of logic. It was Tarski who changed this\nattitude. He was inspired by the Aristotelian tradition in philosophy,\nas well as the non-constructive style of working on the foundations of\nmathematics that was prevailed in Poland. In 1933, he published a book\non the concept of truth (in Polish), translated into German in 1936\nand English in 1956.\n\nTarski\u2019s theory of truth (the semantic conception of truth) has\ntwo aspects: philosophical and formal. Philosophically, it is a\nversion of Aristotle\u2019s idea that truth consists in saying that\nwhat is, is and what is not, is not (it is related to the idea of\ncorrespondence). However, the main problem was formal. Tarski had to\noffer a construction free of semantic paradoxes, in particular the\nLiar. He achieved this goal by postulating that the concept of truth\nmust be defined for a definite, well-constructed formalized language\nL. However, the definition itself should be\nformulated in the metalanguage ML. The definition is\nto be formally correct, that is, it cannot lead to contradictions and\nhas to satisfy the usual conditions of correctness (non-circularity,\netc.). It should also be materially adequate. According to Tarski, the\nbasic intuition is captured by the T-scheme: s is true if and\nonly if P, where the letter s represents the name of\na sentence and P is a translation of this sentence into the\nmetalanguage ML. Now the condition of material\nadequacy (the Convention T) says that a truth definition\nTD is materially adequate if and only if all\nequivalences (that is, for all sentences in L)\nstemming from the T-scheme by appropriate replacements are\nprovable from the definition. The conditions are satisfied by the\nfollowing definition:\n\nA sentence A of a language L is true if and\nonly if it is satisfied by all infinite sequences of objects taken\nfrom the universe of discourse.\n\n\nA more refined version is model-theoretical:\n\nA sentence A is true in a model M if and\nonly if A is satisfied by all infinite sequences of objects\ntaken from the carrier of M.\n\n\nThis definition implies the metalogical principles of excluded middle\nand contradiction, which both are equivalent to the principle of\nbivalence.\n\nTarski\u2019s truth-definition is one of the most debated\ncontemporary philosophical and logical ideas. It strongly influenced\nsemantics, philosophy of language, philosophy of science and\nepistemology. In particular, it became the first step toward\nmodel-theory, a central branch of mathematical logic. Two applications\nof this definition are worth mentioning. Firstly, Tarski succeeded in\nformulating an exact definition of \u201clogical consequence\u201d\n(\u201cfollowing from\u201d or \u201clogical\nentailment\u201d):\n\nA sentence A logically follows from the set\nX of sentences if and only if every model of\nX is a model of A.\n\n\nSecondly, Tarski proved the following limitative theorem:\n\nIf a formal system S captures Peano arithmetic, the\ntruth-predicate (or: the set of S-truth) is not\ndefinable in it.\n\n",
