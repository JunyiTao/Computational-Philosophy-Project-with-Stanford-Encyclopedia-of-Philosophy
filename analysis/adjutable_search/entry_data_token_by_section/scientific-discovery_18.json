Social epistemology and discovery\n\nNew perspectives on scientific discovery have also opened up in the\ncontext of social epistemology (see Goldman & O\u2019Connor\n2021). Social epistemology investigates knowledge production as a\ngroup process, specifically the epistemic effects of group composition\nin terms of cognitive diversity and unity and social interactions\nwithin groups or institutions such as testimony and trust, peer\ndisagreement and critique, and group justification, among others. On\nthis view, discovery is a collective achievement, and the task is to\nexplore how assorted social-epistemic activities or practices have an\nimpact on the knowledge generated by groups in question. There are\nobvious implications for debates about scientific discovery of recent\nresearch in the different branches of social epistemology. Social\nepistemologists have examined individual cognitive agents in their\nroles as group members (as providers of information or as critics) and\nthe interactions among these members (Longino 2001), groups as\naggregates of diverse agents, or the entire group as\nepistemic agent (e.g., Koons 2021, Dragos 2019).  \n\n\nStandpoint theory, for instance, explores the role of outsiders in\nknowledge generation, considering how the sociocultural structures and\npractices in which individuals are embedded aid or obstruct the\ngeneration of creative ideas. According to standpoint theorists,\npeople with standpoint are politically aware and politically engaged\npeople outside the mainstream. Because people with standpoint have\ndifferent experiences and access to different domains of expertise\nthan most members of a culture, they can draw on rich conceptual\nresources for creative thinking (Solomon 2007). \n\nSocial epistemologists examining groups as aggregates of agents\nconsider to what extent diversity among group members is conducive to\nknowledge production and whether and to what extent beliefs and\nattitudes must be shared among group members to make collective\nknowledge possible (Bird 2014). This is still an open question. Some\nformal approaches to model the influence of diversity on knowledge\ngeneration suggest that cognitive diversity is beneficial to\ncollective knowledge generation (Weisberg and Muldoon 2009), but\nothers have criticized the model (Alexander et al (2015), see also\nThoma (2015) and Poyh\u00f6nen (2017) for further discussion). \n 12. Integrated approaches to knowledge generation\n\nThis essay has illustrated that philosophy of discovery has come full\ncircle. Philosophy of discovery has once again become a thriving field\nof philosophical study, now intersecting with, and drawing on\nphilosophical and empirical studies of creative thinking, problem\nsolving under uncertainty, collective knowledge production, and\nmachine learning. Recent approaches to discovery are typically\nexplicitly interdisciplinary and integrative, cutting across previous\ndistinctions among hypothesis generation and theory building, data\ncollection, assessment, and selection; as well as\ndescriptive-analytic, historical, and normative perspectives (Danks\n& Ippoliti 2018, Michel 2021). The goal no longer is to provide\none overarching account of scientific discovery but to produce\nmultifaceted analyses of past and present activities of knowledge\ngeneration in all their complexity and heterogeneity that are\nilluminating to the non-scientist and the scientific researcher alike.\n\n",
