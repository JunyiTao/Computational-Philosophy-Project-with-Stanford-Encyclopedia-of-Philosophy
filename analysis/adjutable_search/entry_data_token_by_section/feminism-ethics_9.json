    "main_text": "Themes in feminist ethics || Feminist criticisms and expansions of traditional moral theories\n2.5 Rejections of absolutism: pragmatism, transnational feminism, and nonideal theory\n\nAs is evident from the foregoing, feminist ethics is not monolithic.\nFeminists have sometimes clashed over being essentialist or\nanti-essentialist. Some feminist work is authored by members of\nprivileged groups, while other feminist work is written by and attends\nto concerns of those in marginalized groups. Some feminists have\nlocated solidarity in commonality, while others advocate coalition in\nthe presence of intersectionality. The different approaches of\nfeminists to ethics raise questions as to whether feminist ethics can\nbe either universalist or absolutist. Feminists have observed that\njust as some men in the history of philosophy have falsely\nuniversalized from their own experience to describe the experiences of\nall humans, some feminists have presumed false universal categories of\nwomen or feminists that elide differences between women or presume to\nspeak for all women (Grimshaw 1996; Herr 2014; Tremain 2015).\nRelatedly, some feminist philosophers have criticized absolutism in\nethical theory, that is, the prioritization of rigorous applications\nof principles to ethical situations regardless of the particularities\nof context or the motivations of the individuals affected, in part\nbecause absolutism, like universalism, takes the absolutists\u2019\npriorities to be rational for all (Noddings 1984; Baier 1994).\nFeminist ethicists who have endorsed visions of universal human rights\nas liberating for all women have been criticized by other feminists as\nengaging in absolutism in ways that may prescribe solutions for women\nin different locations and social situations rather than attending to\nthe perspectives of the women described as needing such rights (Khader\n2018b; Herr 2014).\n\nThe predominant association of feminist ethics with an ethic of care,\nwhich is dichotomous with traditional ethical theories on many levels,\ntogether with decades of feminist critiques of the work of canonical\nabsolutist theorists, might lead to a perception that feminist ethics\nis fundamentally opposed to universalism and absolutism in ethics.\nThis perception, however, is not built into the nature of feminist\nethics, which has been employed to understand, criticize, and correct\nthe role of gender in our moral beliefs and practices by\ndeontologists, utilitarians, contractarians, and virtue ethicists, who\nhold some universal principles or absolute requirements to be basic to\ntheir views. However, it is evident that the preponderance of\nscholarship in feminist ethics tends to prioritize all of the\nfollowing: the moral contexts in which differently situated and\ndifferently gendered agents operate, the testimony and perspectives of\nthe situated agent, the power relationships and political\nrelationships manifest in moral encounters, the vulnerabilities of\nembodied actors that yield a plurality of approaches to ethical\nsituations, and the degrees of agency or capacity that are shaped by\nexperiences with oppression and misogyny. Such priorities tend not to\nresult in relativism, though they certainly depart from rigid forms of\nabsolutism. Feminist ethics is often expressed in morally plural ways,\nincluding pragmatism (Hamington and Bardwell-Jones 2012),\ntransnationalism (Jaggar 2013; Herr 2014; McLaren 2017; Khader 2018b),\nnonideal theory (Mills 2005; Schwartzman 2006; Tessman 2009b; Norlock\n2016), and disability theory (Wendell 1996; Garland-Thomson 2011;\nTremain 2015).\n\nThe following sub-entries included under \u201cfeminism\n(topics)\u201d in the\n Table of Contents\n to this Encyclopedia are relevant to the multiplicity of\napplications of feminist ethics:\n\nfeminist perspectives on autonomy\nfeminist perspectives on class and work\nfeminist perspectives on disability\nfeminist perspectives on globalization\n\nfeminist perspectives on objectification\nfeminist perspectives on power\nfeminist perspectives on rape\nfeminist perspectives on reproduction and the family\nfeminist perspectives on science\nfeminist perspectives on sex and gender\nfeminist perspectives on sex markets\nfeminist perspectives on the body\nfeminist perspectives on the self\nfeminist perspectives on trans issues\n\n\nSee also the entries in the Related Entries section below.\n",
