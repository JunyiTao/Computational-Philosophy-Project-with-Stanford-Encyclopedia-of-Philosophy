Pressure to publish, now ubiquitous\nacross academic institutions, means that researchers often cannot\nafford to simply assign \u201cfailed\u201d or statistically\nnon-significant studies to the file drawer, so instead they p\nhack and cherry-pick results (as discussed below) back to\nsignificance, and back into the published literature. Simmons, Nelson,\nand Simonsohn (2011) explained and demonstrated with simulated results\nhow engaging in such practices inflates the false positive error rate\nof the published literature, leading to a lower rate of reproducible\nresults.\n\n\u201cP hacking\u201d refers to a set of practices which\ninclude: checking the statistical significance of results before\ndeciding whether to collect more data; stopping data collection early\nbecause results have reached statistical significance; deciding\nwhether to exclude data points (e.g., outliers) only after checking\nthe impact on statistical significance and not reporting the impact of\nthe data exclusion; adjusting statistical models, for instance by\nincluding or excluding covariates based on the resulting strength of\nthe main effect of interest; and rounding of a p value to meet\na statistical significance threshold (e.g., presenting 0.053 as\nP < .05). \u201cCherry picking\u201d includes failing to\nreport dependent or response variables or relationships that did not\nreach statistical significance or other threshold and/or failing to\nreport conditions or treatments that did not reach statistical\nsignificance or other threshold. \u201cHARKing\u201d (Hypothesising\nAfter Results are Known) includes presenting ad hoc and/or unexpected\nfindings as though they had been predicted all along (Kerr 1998); and\npresenting exploratory work as though it was confirmatory hypothesis\ntesting (Wagenmakers et al. 2012).
