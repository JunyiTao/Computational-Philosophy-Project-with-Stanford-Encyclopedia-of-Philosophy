    "main_text": "Neurobiological Theories of Consciousness || Recurrent Processing Theory\n3.2 Recurrent Processing Theory\n\nA different explanation ties perceptual consciousness to processing\nindependent of the workspace, with focus on recurrent\nactivity in sensory areas. This approach emphasizes properties of\nfirst-order neural representation as explaining consciousness. Victor\nLamme (2006, 2010) argues that recurrent processing is necessary and\nsufficient for consciousness. Recurrent processing occurs where\nsensory systems are highly interconnected and involve feedforward and\nfeedback connections. For example, forward connections from primary\nvisual area V1, the first cortical visual area, carry information to\nhigher-level processing areas, and the initial registration of visual\ninformation involves a forward sweep of processing. At the same time,\nthere are many feedback connections linking visual areas (Felleman\n& Van Essen 1991), and later in processing, these connections are\nactivated yielding dynamic activity within the visual system.\n\nLamme identifies four stages of normal visual processing:\n\nStage 1: Superficial feedforward processing: visual signals are\nprocessed locally within the visual system.\nStage 2: Deep feedforward processing: visual signals have\ntravelled further forward in the processing hierarchy where they can\ninfluence action.\nStage 3: Superficial recurrent processing: information has\ntraveled back into earlier visual areas, leading to local, recurrent\nprocessing.\nStage 4: Widespread recurrent processing: information activates\nwidespread areas (and as such is consistent with global workspace\naccess).\n\n\nLamme holds that recurrent processing in Stage 3 is necessary and\nsufficient for consciousness. Thus, what it is for a visual state to\nbe conscious is for a certain recurrent processing state to hold of\nthe relevant visual circuitry. This identifies the crucial difference\nbetween the global neuronal workspace and recurrent processing theory:\nthe former holds that recurrent processing at Stage 4 is necessary for\nconsciousness while the latter holds that recurrent processing at\nStage 3 is sufficient. Thus, recurrent processing theory affirms\nphenomenal consciousness without access by the global neuronal\nworkspace. In that sense, it is an overflow theory (see\n section 2.2).\n\nWhy think that Stage 3 processing is sufficient for consciousness?\nGiven that Stage 3 processing is not accessible to introspective\nreport, we lack introspective evidence for sufficiency. Lamme appeals\nto experiments with brief presentation of stimuli such as letters\nwhere subjects are said to report seeing more than they can identify\nin report (Lamme 2010). For example, in George Sperling\u2019s\npartial report paradigm (Sperling 1960), subjects are briefly\npresented with an array of 12 letters (e.g., in 300 ms presentations)\nbut are typically able to report only three to four letters even as\nthey claim to see more letters (but see Phillips 2011). It is not\nclear that this is strong motivation for recurrent processing, since\nthe very fact that subjects can report seeing more letters shows that\nthey have some access to them, just not access to letter identity.\n\nLamme also presents what he calls neuroscience arguments.\nThis strategy compares two neural networks, one taken to be sufficient\nfor consciousness, say the processing at Stage 4 as per Global\nWorkspace theories, and one where sufficiency is in dispute, say\nrecurrent activity in Stage 3. Lamme argues that certain features\nfound in Stage 4 are also found in Stage 3 and given this similarity,\nit is reasonable to hold that Stage 3 processing suffices for\nconsciousness. For example, both stages exhibit recurrent processing.\nGlobal neuronal workspace theorists can allow that recurrent\nprocessing in stage 3 is correlated, even necessary, but deny that\nthis activity is explanatory in the relevant sense of identifying\nsufficient conditions for consciousness.\n\nIt is worth reemphasizing the empirical challenge in testing whether\naccess is necessary for phenomenal consciousness (sections\n 2.1\u20133).\n The two theories return different answers, one requiring access, the\nother denying it. As we saw, the methodological challenge in testing\nfor the presence of phenomenal consciousness independently of access\nremains a hurdle for both theories.\n",
