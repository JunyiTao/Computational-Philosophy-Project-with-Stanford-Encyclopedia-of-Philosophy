    "main_text": "Scientific Reasoning || The Equivalence Condition\n3.2 The Equivalence Condition\n\nFew papers in the philosophy of science have produced such a\nvoluminous literature. In a \u201cPostscript\u201d, Hempel addressed\na few of the suggestions that have been advanced to analyze the\nparadoxical quality of the argument (Hempel 1965a). Several were\nintent upon explaining them quantitatively on the ground that, for\nexample, there are many more non-black things than black things or\nthat the probability of being non-black is much great than the\nprobability of being a raven, whereas others appealed to Bayesian\nprinciples and suggested that the prior probability for ravens being\nblack makes testing non-ravens of considerably less relative risk.\nHempel replied that even the existence of a quantitative measure of\nevidential support poses no challenge to his conclusion that the\nparadoxical cases\u2014non-black non-ravens, such as white\nshoes\u2014are confirmatory.\n\nHempel acknowledges that an explanation for why the paradoxical cases\nappear to be non-confirmatory may have something to do with fashioning\nhypotheses about classes that are affected by their relative size.\nSince the class of non-ravens is so much larger than the class of\nravens, where what we are interested in, by hypothesis, is the color\nof ravens, instances of non-black non-ravens might count as\nconfirmatory but to a lesser degree than instances of black ravens. He\nallows the possibility that perhaps the theory of confirmation should\nproceed quantitatively, which might provide a less perplexing basis\nfor assessments of this kind. But he steadfastly maintains that the\nconsequences he identified following from the application of the\nprinciples he employed are logically impeccable, no matter how\npsychologically surprising they may seem (Hempel 1960).\n\nThe most important claim of Hempel (1965a) is that confirmation cannot\nbe adequately defined by linguistic means alone. Here he cites Goodman\n(1955) to demonstrate that some hypotheses of the form,\n\u201c\\((x)(Fx \\supset Gx)\\)\u201d, are not confirmable even by\ninstances of the kind \u201c\\(Fc\\)\u201d and \u201c\\(Gc\\)\u201d.\nIf \u201c\\(Rx\\)\u201d stands for \u201c\\(x\\) is a\nraven\u201d and \u201c\\(Bx\\)\u201d for \u201c\\(x\\)\nis blite\u201d (where \\(x\\) is blite when it has been\nexamined before time \\(t\\) and is black or has not been\nexamined before \\(t\\) and is white), then any raven\nobserved before \\(t\\) and found to be black confirms\nthe hypothesis, \u201c\\((x)(Rx \\supset Bx)\\)\u201d; yet this\nhypothesis implies that all ravens not examined before \\(t\\)\nare white, a consequence that, in Hempel\u2019s\nlanguage, \u201cmust surely count as disconfirmed rather than as\nconfirmed\u201d. And he endorses Goodman\u2019s suggestion that\nwhether a universal conditional is capable of being confirmed by its\npositive instances turns out to depend upon the character of its\nconstituent predicates and their past use.\n",
