    "main_text": "Ontological unities || Ontological unities and reduction\n4.1 Ontological unities and reduction\n\nSince Nagel\u2019s influential model of reduction by derivation, most\ndiscussions of the unity of science have been cast in terms of\nreductions between concepts and the entities they describe, and\nbetween theories incorporating the descriptive concepts. Ontological\nunity is expressed by a preferred set of such ontological units. In\nthis regard, it should be noted that the selection of units typically\nrelies on assumptions about classification or natural order such as\ncommitments to natural kinds or a hierarchy of levels.\n\nIn terms of concepts featured in preferred descriptions, explanatory\nor not, reduction endorses taxonomical monism: a privileged set of\nfundamental kinds of things. These privileged kinds are often known as\nso-called natural kinds; although, as it has been argued, monism does\nnot entail realism (Slater 2005) and the notion admits of multiple\ninterpretations, ranging from the more conventionalist to the more\nessentialist (Tahko 2021; see a critique in Cat 2022a). Natural\nkindness has further been debated in terms, for instance, of the\ncontrast between so-called cluster and causal theories. Connectedly,\npluralism does not entail anti-realism (Dupr\u00e9 1993), nor does\nrealism entail monism or essentialism (Khalidi 2021). Without\nadditional metaphysical assumptions, the fundamental units are\nambiguous with respect to their status as either entity or property.\nReduction may determine the fundamental kinds or level through the\nanalysis of entities.\n\nA distinctive ontological model is as follows. The hierarchy of levels\nof reduction is fixed by part-whole relations. The levels of\naggregation of entities run all the way down to atomic particles and\nfield parts, rendering microphysics the fundamental science (Gillett\n2016). The focus of recent accounts has been placed on the relation\nbetween the causal powers at different levels and how lower-level\nentities and powers determine higher-level ones. Discussions have\ncentered on whether the relation is of identity between types or\ntokens of things (Thalos 2013; Gillette 2016; Wilson 2021; see more\nbelow) or even if causal powers are the relevant unit of analysis\n(Thalos 2013).\n\nA classic reference to this compositional type of account is Oppenheim\nand Putnam\u2019s \u201cThe Unity of Science as a Working\nHypothesis\u201d (Oppenheim and Putnam 1958; Oppenheim and Hempel had\nworked in the 1930s on taxonomy and typology, a question of broad\nintellectual, social and political relevance in Germany at the time).\nOppenheim and Putnam intended to articulate an idea of science as a\nreductive unity of concepts and laws reduced to those of the most\nelementary elements. They also defended it as an empirical\nhypothesis\u2014not an a priori ideal, project or\nprecondition\u2014about science. Moreover, they claimed that its\nevolution manifested a trend in that unified direction out of the\nsmallest entities and lowest levels of aggregation. In an important\nsense, the evolution of science recapitulates, in the reverse, the\nevolution of matter, from aggregates of elementary particles to the\nformation of complex organisms and species (we find a similar\nassumption in Weinberg\u2019s downward arrow of explanation). Unity,\nthen, is manifested not just in mereological form, but also\ndiachronically, genealogically or historically.\n\nA weaker form of ontological reduction advocated for the biomedical\nsciences with the causal notion of partial reductions:\nexplanations of localized scope (focused on parts of higher-level\nsystems only) laying out a causal mechanism connecting different\nlevels in the hierarchy of composition and organization (Schaffner\n1993; Schaffner 2006; Scerri has similarly discussed degrees of\nreduction in Scerri 1994). An extensional, domain-relative approach\nintroduces the distinction between \u201cdomain preserving\u201d and\n\u201cdomain combining\u201d reductions. Domain-preserving\nreductions are intra-level reductions and occur between \\(T_1\\) and\nits predecessor \\(T_2\\). In this parlance, however, \\(T_2\\)\n\u201creduces\u201d to \\(T_1\\). This notion of\n\u201creduction\u201d does not refer to any relation of explanation\n(Nickles 1973).\n\nThe claim that reduction, as a relation of explanation, needs to be a\nrelation between theories or even involve any theory has also been\nchallenged. One such challenge focuses on \u201cinter-level\u201d\nexplanations in the form of compositional redescription and\ncausal mechanisms (Wimsatt 1976). The role of biconditionals or even\nSchaffner-type identities, as factual relations, is heuristic (Wimsatt\n1976). The heuristic value extends to the preservation of the\nhigher-level, reduced concepts, especially for cognitive and pragmatic\nreasons, including reasons of empirical evidence. This amounts to\nrejecting the structural, formal approach to unity and reductionism\nfavored by the logical-positivist tradition. Reductionism is another\nexample of the functional, purposive nature of scientific practice.\nThe metaphysical view that follows is a pragmatic and non-eliminative\nrealism (Wimsatt 2006). As a heuristic, this kind of non-eliminative\npragmatic reductionism is a complex stance. It is, across levels,\nintegrative and intransitive, compositional, mechanistic and\nfunctionally localized, approximative and abstractive. It is bound to\nadopting false idealizations, focusing on regularities and stable\ncommon behavior, circumstances and properties. It is also constrained\nin its rational calculations and methods, tool-binding and\nproblem-relative. The heuristic value of eliminative, inter-level\nreductions has been defended as well (Poirier 2006).\n\nThe appeal to formal laws and deductive relations is dropped for sets\nof concepts or vocabularies in the replacement analysis\n(Spector 1978). This approach allows for talk of entity reduction or\nbranch reduction, and even direct theory replacement, without the\noperation of laws, and it circumvents vexing difficulties raised by\nbridge principles and the deductive derivability condition\n(self-reduction, infinite regress, etc.). Formal relations only\nguarantee, but do not define, the reduction relation. Replacement\nfunctions are meta-linguistic statements. As Sellars argued in the\ncase of explanation, this account distinguishes between reduction and\nthe testing for reduction, and it highlights the role of derivations\nin both. Finally, replacement can be in practice or in theory.\nReplacement in practice does not advocate elimination of the reduced\nor replaced entities or concepts (Spector 1978).\n\nAs indicated above, reductive models and associated organization of\nscientific theories and disciplines assume an epistemic hierarchy\ngrounded on an ontological hierarchy of levels of organization of\nentities, properties or phenomena, from societies down to cells,\nmolecules and subatomic elements. Patterns of behavior of entities at\nlower, more fundamental levels are considered more general, stable and\nexplanatory.\n\nLevels forming a hierarchy are discrete and stratified so that\nentities at level n strongly depend on entities at level \\(n-1.\\) The\ndifferent levels may be distinguished in different ways: by\ndifferences in scale, by a relation of realization and, especially, by\na relation of composition such that entities at level n are considered\ncomposed of, or decomposable into, entities at level \\(n-1.\\)\n\nThis assumption has been the target of criticism (Thalos 2013;\nPotochnik 2017). Neither scales, realization nor decomposition can fix\nan absolute hierarchy of levels. Critics have noted, for instance,\nthat entities may participate in causal interactions at multiple\nlevels and across levels in physical models (Thalos 2013) and\nacross biological and neurobiological models (Haug 2010; Eronen\n2013).\n\nIn addition, the compartmentalization of theories and their concepts\nor vocabulary into levels neglects the existence of empirically\nmeaningful and causally explanatory relations between entities or\nproperties at different levels. If they are neglected as theoretical\nknowledge and left as only bridge principles, the possibility of\ncompleteness of knowledge is jeopardized. Maximizing completeness of\nknowledge requires a descriptive unity of all phenomena at all levels\nand anything between these levels. Any bounded region or body of\nknowledge neglecting such cross-boundary interactions is radically\nincomplete, and not just confirmationally or evidentially so; we may\nrefer to this problem as the problem of cross-boundary\nincompleteness at either intra-level or horizontal\nincompleteness and, on a hierarchy, the problem of inter-level or\nvertical incompleteness (Kincaid 1997; Cat 1998).\n\nIf levels cannot track, for instance, same-level causal relations,\neither their causal explanatory relevance is derivative and contextual\n(Craver 2007), their role is cognitive and pragmatic as in the role as\nconceptual coordinate systems or, more radically, altogether\ndispensable (Thalos 2013; Potochnik 2017). As a result, they fail to\nfix a corresponding hierarchy of fields and subfields of scientific\nresearch defended by reductionist accounts.\n\nThe most radical form of reduction as replacement is often called\neliminativism. The position has made a considerable impact in\nphilosophy of psychology and philosophy of mind (Churchland 1981;\nChurchland 1986). On this view the vocabulary of the reducing theories\n(neurobiology) eliminates and replaces that of the reduced ones\n(psychology), leaving no substantive relation between them (which is\nonly a replacement rule) (see also\n eliminative materialism).\n\nFrom a semantic standpoint, one may distinguish different kinds of\nreduction in terms of four criteria, two epistemological and two\nontological: fundamentalism, approximation, abstract hierarchy and\nspatial hierarchy. Fundamentalism implies that the features\nof a system can be explained in terms only of factors and rules from\nanother realm. Abstract hierarchy is the assumption that the\nrepresentation of a system involves a hierarchy of levels of\norganization with the explanatory factors being located at the lower\nlevels. Spatial hierarchy is a special case of abstract\nhierarchy in which the criterion of hierarchical relation is a spatial\npart-whole or containment relation. Strong reduction satisfies the\nthree \u201csubstantive\u201d criteria, whereas weak reduction only\nsatisfies fundamentalism. Approximate reductions\u2014strong and\nhierarchical\u2014are those which satisfy the criterion of\nfundamentalism only approximately (Sarkar 1998; the merit of\nSarkar\u2019s proposal resides in its systematic attention to\nhierarchical conditions and, more originally, to different conditions\nof approximation; see also Ramsey 1995; Lange 1995).\n\nThe semantic turn extends to more recent notion of models that do not\nfall under the strict semantic or model-theoretic notion of\nmathematical structures (Giere 1999; Morgan and Morrison 1999). This\nis a more flexible framework about relevant formal relations and the\nscope of relevant empirical situations. It is implicitly or explicitly\nadopted by most accounts of unity without reduction. One may add the\nprimacy of temporal representation and temporal parts, temporal\nhierarchy or temporal compositionality, first emphasized\nby Oppenheim and Putnam as a model of genealogical or diachronic\nunity. This framework applies to processes both of evolution and\ndevelopment (a more recent version is in McGivern 2008 and in Love and\nH\u00fctteman 2011).\n\nThe shift in the accounts of scientific theory from syntactic to\nsemantic approaches has changed conceptual perspectives and,\naccordingly, formulations and evaluations of reductive relations and\nreductionism. However, examples of the semantic approach focusing on\nmathematical structures and satisfaction of set-theoretic relations\nhave focused on syntactic features\u2014including the axiomatic form\nof a theory\u2014in the discussion of reduction (Sarkar 1998; da\nCosta and French 2003). In this sense, the structuralist approach can\nbe construed as a neo-Nagelian account, while an alternative line of\nresearch has championed the more traditional structuralist semantic\napproach (Balzer and Moulines 1996; Moulines 2006; Ruttkamp 2000;\nRuttkamp and Heidema 2005).\n",
