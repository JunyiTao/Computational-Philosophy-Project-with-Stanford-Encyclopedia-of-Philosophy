Ronald Coase [1960] and\nGuido Calabresi [1961] are generally identified as the seminal\narticles but Commons [1924] and Hale [1952] among others had brought\neconomic thinking to the study of law in the 1910s and 1920s.\n\nRichard Posner [1973] brought economic analysis of law to the\nattention of the general legal academy; by the late 1970s, his work\nhad provoked a vigorous controversy. This controversy was both general\nand doctrinally specific. Posner had claimed generally that the common\nlaw was and ought to be efficient. This latter claim provoked a broad\ncontroversy about the evaluation of legal rules.\n\nMore specifically, controversy recurred each time economic analysts of\nlaw addressed another doctrinal area. More often than not, the\nintroduction of economic analysis into the study of a doctrine\ntransformed that area of scholarship. For a time, economic analysis\ndominated the study of private law in the United States; arguably it\nstill dominates, though a healthy resurgence of moral accounts of\nthese areas has recently emerged to challenge economic analysis of\nprivate law.\n\nMany practitioners and critics alike believe that economic analysis of\nlaw offers a comprehensive theory of law. As traditionally understood,\na comprehensive theory of law has several components. First, a\ncomprehensive theory of law begins with a characterization of the\nnature of law. This component distinguishes law not only from other\nnormative systems such as morality, religion, and social conventions\nsuch as etiquette but also from coercion and politics.\n\nThe second part of a comprehensive theory of law characterizes the\ngrounds of law. Dworkin framed the grounds of law as the truth\nconditions for a proposition of law. From this perspective, much of\nthe debate over the concept of law concerns the role that morality\nplays in these truth conditions. As discussed in section 3 below, the\nfirst and second parts of a comprehensive theory of law have often\nbeen conflated in the debate over the concept of law.\n\nThe third part of a a comprehensive theory of law identifies the\nnature of the reasons for action that law provides. Often, this aspect\nof a theory of law is subsumed under the second part that identifies\nthe grounds of law. For purposes of an exposition of the economic\ntheory of law, however, it is useful to distinguish these two\nquestions.\n\nThe fourth part of a comprehensive theory of law identifies the value\nof legality. The fifth and final part of a comprehensive theory of law\narticulates a normative theory of adjudication, a theory of how judges\nought to decide cases.\n\nFramed this way, it is not clear that economic analysis of law does\nprovide a comprehensive theory of law. The questions posed above have\nrarely been addressed clearly and explicitly by economic analysts of\nlaw. The early debates conflated theories of adjudication with the\nvalue of legality; subsequent debates have largely concerned theories\nof private law rather than of law generally. This essay thus offers\nboth an interpretation of the approach to these five questions\nimplicit in the practice of economic analysis of law and a\nrecharacterization of economic analysis of law generally. \n\nEconomic analysis of law is not a single, unitary practice but a set\nof projects that share a methodological approach. The typical economic\nanalysis of law does not set its task within the framework of a\ngeneral legal theory. Rather, it addresses a specific question about\nthe causes or consequences or social value of a specific legal rule or\nset of legal rules. Phrased differently, the typical economic analysis\nof law investigates a specific legal rule or institution rather than\nmake general claims about the nature of law. \n\nNonetheless, economic analysis of law, or at least strands of it,\nimplicitly offer distinctive, often radical, answers to the questions\naddressed by legal theory. Moreover, some strands suggest a radically\ndifferent perspective on law and legal theory. The next section sets\nout the complex set of claims that emerge from the mass of economic\nanalyses of law and identifies three projects that organize much of\nthe work in the field. Subsequent sections ask what perspective on law\nthese claims and projects implicitly or explicitly provide.\n", "toc": [{"#ClaiProjWithEconAnalLaw": "1.

Claims and Projects within Economic Analysis of Law\n1.1 Rationality in Economic Analysis of Law\n\nEconomic analysis of law deploys the tools of micro-economic theory to\nstudy legal rules and institutions. The various approaches and\nprojects within economic analysis of law thus share a common core.\nThat core consists of the conception of action at the center of\nmicro-economic\n theory.[1]\n When economic analysis of law first emerged in the 1960s, scholars\nadopted the standard rationality assumptions that dominated\nmicroeconomic theory at the time. This practice still dominates the\nliterature; we shall call it the standard or classical model. In the\n1990s, some scholars (see e.g. Jolls, Sunstein, and Thaler [1998])\nbegan to apply the methods of behavioral economics to economic\nanalysis of law. Behavioral economics rests on a different\nunderstanding of the underpinnings of choice and decision than the\nclassical model. \n1.1.1 Rationality in the Classical Model\n\nRational action in economics means that each agent acts to maximize\nher \u201cpreferences\u201d in whatever environment she finds\nherself. A preference is a ranking of the elements in her\ndomain of preference. The agent\u2019s domain of preference consists\nof the things that fundamentally matter to her. In standard models of\nconsumer behavior, for example, the agent has fundamental preferences\nover consumption bundles. Her decision problem consists of choosing a\nconsumption bundle from the set of feasible consumption bundles, where\nfeasibility is defined by the prices of goods and the agent\u2019s\nincome. Arlen and Kornhauser [2021] elaborate on the structure of\npreferences in economic analysis of law. \n\nIn most economic analyses of law, the situation is more complex. The\nagent has preferences over some set of consequences\u2014her income\nor wealth, her state of health, etc.\u2014and she chooses some action\nthat in part determines which consequence is realized. Typically, her\ndomain of preference differs from her domain of choice, often because\nshe chooses a strategy that, in conjunction with the strategy\nchoices of other agents, jointly determines the consequence. \n\nAt its most abstract level, this conception of rationality is very\nflexible as the constraints on preferences are almost purely formal.\n(The discussion in section 4 essentially investigates the extent of\nthis flexibility.) \n\nBasically, the agent\u2019s ranking of elements of her domain of\npreference must be complete and transitive. Completeness means only\nthat the agent, when presented with any pair A and B of elements in\nher domain of preference can rank A and B. That is, the agent either\nprefers A to B, prefers B to A, or is indifferent between A and B.\nSome, but not all, relations are complete. The relation \u201cPareto\nsuperior to,\u201d discussed at length in section 6.2, for example,\nis not complete.\n\nTransitivity means that if the agent prefers an element A to an\nelement B and she prefers the element B to a third element C, then she\nprefers element A to element C. Many, but not all, relations are\ntransitive. The relation \u201cfriends with,\u201d for example, is\nnot transitive as A may be friends with B and B may be friends with C\nwhile A and C mutually detest each other. The two conditions are thus\nminimal though not empty. \n\nEvery economic analysis of law provides some substantive content to\neach agent\u2019s preference ranking. Typically, the analyst\nattributes self-interested preferences to each agent. The\nagent ranks consequences solely on the basis of their effect on her.\nIn the standard market model, for example, the agent cares only about\nher own consumption not the consumption of others. In the standard\neconomic model of accident law, she cares only about injuries to\nherself and costs that she may incur; she pays no attention to\ninjuries to others or costs that others incur. \n\nOf course, one might define \u201cself-interested\u201d in a broad\nway to include anything that motivates the agent. Typically, however,\nthe analyst assumes that the agent\u2019s preferences are\nnarrowly self-interested; she cares only about her own\neconomic advantage or her own health and safety. The assumption of\nnarrowly self-interested preferences is very restrictive. An agent\nwith narrowly self-interested preferences seems to be incapable of\nfollowing a rule or having anything other than a prudential reason for\naction. The assumption of narrow self-interest thus seems to limit the\nconception of the normativity of law to a bare sanction theory of\nduty. We discuss this issue in section 4 below.\n1.1.2 Behavioral Economic Analysis of Law\n\nBehavioral economic analysis of law takes three forms. The first\naccepts the formal framework of rational choice but rejects the\ninterpretation of preferences in this framework as self-interested.\nCall this the \u201cbroad RCT\u201d branch of behavioral economics.\nThe other two forms of behavioral economics derive from psychology\nwhich seeks to understand the mental processes that agents actually\ndeploy in their decision making. Both of these forms of behavioral\neconomics reject the apparent assumption of the classical model that\nagents consciously and directly maximize their preferences. But each\nform adopts a different stance towards human rationality. The\n\u201cfast and frugal heuristics\u201d branch claims that agents are\necologically rational. The heuristics and biases form of behavioral\neconomics contends that agents are not rational. We discuss these in\nturn. \n\nThe broad RCT approach endorses the formal preference model of the\nclassical model; it only rejects the narrow interpretation of\npreferences as self-interested. Individuals may have\nnon-self-interested preferences. They may have\n\u201cpro-social\u201d preferences that reflect a concern for\nothers. They may have preferences for \u201cfairness\u201d which\nreflect a \u201cpreference\u201d for more equal distributions of\nbenefits and burdens. Indeed, one might posit preferences that reflect\nconcerns for almost anything. The approach thus risks the ad\nhoc ascription of preferences, an issue discussed further in\nsection 4. \n\nThe ecological rationality school accepts the classical model as a\nnormative standard against which individual behavior should be\nassessed. It rejects the classical model as descriptive of individual\ndecision procedures. An agent does not solve the optimization problem\nthat the classical and broad RCT models posit. This school recognizes\nthat computation is costly and that often the agent lacks adequate\ninformation to complete the calculation. Consequently, individuals\ndeploy heuristic decision procedures that, under these constraints,\nperform well as measured by the RCT model of rationality. \n\nThe heuristics and biases school, by contrast, understands the\nexistence of heuristics and biases as evidence that individuals behave\nirrationally. Any decision process that deviates from classical logic,\nBayesian updating, or strict preference maximization constitutes\nirrational behavior. \n\nBehavioral economic analysis of law typically adapts the classical\nmodel to include a heuristic or bias. The model, that is, specifies a\ndecision process that, except on the dimension along which the\nheuristic or bias works, conforms to the classical model. The analysis\nthen identifies equilibrium behavior in this model. The structure of\nanalysis thus parallels the structure of a classical analysis. \n1.2 The Basic Claims Underlying Economic Analysis of Law\n\nPosner [1973] made two claims that have usually defined the debate\naround the philosophical foundations of economic analysis of law. The\nfirst claim, often called the positive claim, asserts that\ncommon law legal rules are, in fact, efficient. The second claim,\noften called the normative claim, asserts that common law\nlegal rules ought to be efficient. In both claims, Posner understood\n\u201cefficiency\u201d to mean the maximization of the social\nwillingness-to-pay but subsequent authors have sometimes used the term\nin its more conventional economic sense of Pareto efficiency. As both\nof these claims predate the emergence of behavioral economic analysis\nof law, each relies on the classical theory.\n\nEach claim is ambiguous. Consider the first claim, the positive claim.\nOn the one hand, it might mean that common law legal rules\ninduce efficient behavior. On the other hand, it might mean\nthat the law is efficient; that is, that the content of the\nlaw is identified by its efficiency. Or the claim might mean that\nefficiency provides the best rationale of the \u201claw\u201d in\nsome doctrinal area. \n\nThe second of Posner\u2019s claims, that the common law ought to be\nefficient, also presents multiple ambiguities. Do we interpret the\nclaim as a theory of adjudication (i.e., as a theory of how common law\njudges ought to decide cases)? Or should we understand the claim as\nasserting that efficiency is the appropriate criterion against which\nto assess judicial performance? Or should we understand the claim as\nasserting that lawmakers, whether judges, legislators, or\nadministrators, should choose efficient rules?\n\nThis disambiguation of Posner\u2019s claims yields six distinct\nclaims about law that fall into a positive and a normative cluster. A\nthird set of two claims follows from the methodology of economic\nanalysis of law\u2014the application of the tools of micro-economic\ntheory to the study of legal rules and institutions.\n\nI begin with the three positive claims that correspond to the\ndisambiguation of Posner\u2019s positive claim and the two claims\nthat flow from economic methodology. Claim (I), the\nexplanatory claim, asserts that common law legal rules induce\nefficient behavior. Claim (II), the content claim, asserts\nthat the criterion of efficiency determines the content of the law. A\npositivist might understand this claim as a claim about the content of\nthe rule of recognition. Claim (III), the doctrinal claim,\nstates that the criterion of efficiency rationalizes\nprevailing legal rules and institutions. This doctrinal claim is\nweaker than the content claim; the latter asserts either that\nefficiency causes the content of the law or that it justifies it. The\ndoctrinal claim, by contrast, asserts only that efficiency makes sense\nof the legal materials.\n\nFor clarity, note the ambiguity in the sense in which a legal rule is\n\u201cefficient\u201d in claims (II) and (III). In the most\nstraightforward, economic interpretation, claims (II) and (III) refer\nto the efficiency of the behavior induced by the legal rule. Claims\n(II) and (III) therefore seem to presuppose claim (I). Many, if not\nmost, economic analyses of law, however, assert only that the legal\nrule is efficient within some\n model.[2]\n A judge, policymaker, or analyst might believe, on the basis of the\nefficiency of a rule in a model, that the rule induces efficient\nbehavior in the world but the efficiency of the rule in the model does\nnot logically entail efficiency in the world. \n\nClaims (I), (II) and (III) apparently all presuppose the classical\nmodel of narrowly self-interested actors as these preferences underlie\nthe first and second welfare theorems of general equilibrium analysis.\nThese theorems state that every competitive equilibrium is Pareto\nefficient and conversely, every Pareto efficient allocation can be\nsupported by a competitive equilibrium. Of course, it is possible that\necological rationality would lead to similar desirable outcomes. \n\nI now turn to the two claims that derive from the methodological\ncommitments of economic analysis of law. These two claims are also\nexplanatory claims. Claim (IV), the behavioral claim, asserts\nthat economic theory explains how individuals respond to legal rules\nand institutions. Claim (V), the causal claim, asserts that\neconomically motivated action by both public officials and private\ncitizens explains the content of legal rules and the structure of\nlegal institutions. Each of these claims in principle has two\nvariants. Claim (IVa) for example asserts that the classical theory\nexplains how individuals respond to legal rules. Claim (IVb)asserts\nthat some behavioral theory explains how individuals respond to legal\nrules. Similarly, claim (V) asserts that private citizens and public\nofficials conform to the same behavioral theory. In practice,\nvirtually all research addressing claim (V) attributes classical,\nnarrowly self-interested preferences to both private individuals and\npublic officials. \n\nBoth claims (IV) and (V) might refer to the classical model or to any\nof the three variants of the behavioral model. In fact most of the\nliterature relies on the classical model though, increasingly,\nscholars are investigating the consequences of the behavioral model\nwithin the context of claim (IV). \n\nClaim (I) differs from claim (IV). The explanatory claim asserts that\n(some) legal rules and institutions induce efficient behavior but does\nnot identify the mechanism through which this efficient behavior\nresults. The behavioral claim, by contrast, identifies the mechanisms\nthrough which legal rules and institutions influence behavior, but it\ndoes not assert that the resulting behavior is\n efficient.[3]\n Claims (II) and (III) are equally silent about the mechanisms that\nyield efficiency though one might think that claim (II) asserts that\njudges and other public officials intentionally pursue efficient\nrules. \n\nNote also that claim (II) differs from Claim (V) for similar reasons.\nClaim (II) states that efficiency is one of the grounds of law. Many\nlegal rules should thus be efficient. Claim (V), by contrast, asserts\nonly that law results from the self-interested behavior of individual\ncitizens and public officials. This behavior does not necessarily\nyield efficient rules or institutions.\n\nFinally, note that the methodological claims (IV) and (V) apparently\nreject standard accounts of the normativity of law, an issue addressed\nmore fully in section 4.\n\nConsider now the three normative claims that follow from the\ndisambiguation of Posner\u2019s initial normative claim. Claim (VI),\nthe adjudicatory, claim asserts that judges ought, in their\ndecision of cases, to promote efficiency. This claim understands\nPosner\u2019s claim as a theory of adjudication. Claim (VII), the\nevaluative claim, asserts that the primary criterion against\nwhich to assess legal rules and institutions is efficiency. Claim\n(VIII), the design claim, asserts that policymakers should\ndesign legal rules and institutions to promote efficiency. Note that\nclaims (VII) and (VIII) are independent. Designing efficient legal\nrules and institutions might be desirable for non-efficiency reasons.\nConversely, efficiency might dictate the design of inefficient\ninstitutions.\n\nIn the late 1970s and early 1980s, controversy raged primarily over\nthe evaluative claim. This debate largely recapitulated the debate\nover the \u201cnew welfare economics\u201d that occurred in\neconomics in the late 1930s and early 1940s. Debate over this claim\nbriefly resurged with the publication of Kaplow and Shavell [2004].\nMore recently, however, claim (III), the doctrinal claim has received\nthe most philosophical attention. \n\nThe philosophy of law has traditionally focused on a limited set of\nquestions centered around the \u201cconcept of law\u201d and the\nexistence or non-existence of an obligation to obey the law. Thus,\nphilosophers of law have investigated the nature of law, its relation\nto coercion and morality, how judges ought to decide cases, and\nwhether, to what extent, and how law gives agents reasons for action.\n\n\nThe eight claims identified above do not correspond directly to these\ntraditional questions in the philosophy of law. As already noted,\nclaim (II) at least implicitly adopts a legal positivist understanding\nof law. Claim (VI) offers an explicit normative theory of\nadjudication, though one apparently at odds with how judges in fact\ndecide cases. Central philosophic questions concerning the concept of\nlaw, its normativity, and the obligation to obey the law, however, are\nnot directly addressed. The behavioral claim (IV) as well as the\ncausal claim (V) and the explanatory claim (I), by contrast, concern\nempirical issues that philosophers of law generally neglect.\nNevertheless, the controversy within the legal academy has generally\nregarded economic analysis of law as providing a comprehensive theory\nof law that challenges traditional approaches to law. Indeed, an\nexplanation of the vehemence of the controversy should identify\ndifferences in fundamental views concerning law.\n1.3 Three Strands of Thought within Economic Analysis of Law\n\nThe vast literature of economic analysis of law is not easily\ncharacterized. As the set of distinct claims suggests, the literature\ncontains a large number of different projects. For purposes of this\nessay, we may identify three distinct strands of thought within\neconomic analysis of law. A large percentage, but not all, of the\nliterature in economic analysis of law falls within one of these three\nstrands. I shall call one strand policy analysis, the second\nstrand political economy, and the third strand doctrinal\n analysis.[4]\n\nPolicy analysis generally focuses on the analysis of the effects of\nlegal rules and institutions on outcomes. An outcome usually\nconsists of the \u201cobjective\u201d effects of the rule or\ninstitution on the behavior of \u201cprivate\u201d individuals.\nPolicy analysis then typically evaluates the rule or institution under\nstudy against some social objective function. Often policy analysis\nadopts \u201cefficiency\u201d as the evaluative criterion.\n\nPolicy analysis is thus linked both to the behavioral claim (Claim IV)\nand the design claim (Claim VIII). Neither of these links is logical\nor conceptual. The behavioral claim concerns the causal mechanism that\ndetermines how individuals respond to legal rules and institutions;\nthese rules have effects through standard economic processes. The\ndesign aspect of policy analysis, however, requires not that the\npolicymaker explain the effects of legal rules on behavior but\nthat the policymaker predict the behavior the rules will\ninduce. Prediction does not necessarily require the identification of\na causal mechanism. Correlation suffices.\n\nA gap also exists between the design aim of policy analysis and the\ndesign claim. The policy analyst may choose to assess the predicted\nbehavior against any criterion she deems relevant; she may thus,\ncontrary to the design claim, adopt non-efficiency criteria to select\na legal rule. \n\nPolitical economy, by contrast, investigates the operation of\npolitical institutions such as electoral systems, courts,\nlegislatures, the executive and administrative agencies. These\ninstitutions make policy or determine which people make policy.\nPolitical economy thus seeks to explain how the content of the law is\ndetermined. In some instances we might understand political economy\nsimply as the application of the behavioral claim to the\nconstitutional and legal rules and practices that structure\nlegislation, administrative action, and adjudication.\n\nBoth policy analysis and political economy examine behavior. The\npolicy analyst focuses on the behavior induced by legal rules and\ninstitutions. Political economy concentrates on behavior that causes\nlegal rules and institutions. Doctrinal analysis, by contrast, focuses\non the content of the legal doctrine developed by courts in\nadjudication. It asserts that efficiency rationalizes the content of\nthe law. We might understand \u201cthe content of the law\u201d in\nat least three ways. First, it might, as the behavioral claim does,\nrefer to the behavior induced by the legal rules announced in judicial\nopinions. Alternatively, the analyst interprets these opinions and\nother texts to extract an economic model that underlies the\ndecision\u2019s legal view of the world. On this interpretation,\nclaims (II) and (III) might be true even though legal rules induced\ninefficient behavior in the real world because the announced legal\nrule might be efficient within the implicit model used by judges but\ninefficient in the world as it actually is.\n\nThe first understanding of doctrinal analysis suggests a connection to\nthe classical behavioral claim (claim (IVa)). It would also suggest\nthat doctrinal analysis would have developed a substantial empirical\ncomponent that investigated what behavior doctrine actually induced.\nAs this empirical component is largely absent, we may understand\ndoctrinal analysis in the second, alternative way. The next section\nexamines the philosophical debates that have emerged from this\nalternative, non-behavioral understanding of doctrinal analysis. \n\nThese three strands may be differentiated in a number of ways. First,\neach strand makes different motivational assumptions about public\nofficials. Policy analysis generally assumes that public officials in\ngeneral, and judges in particular, are conscientious. Judges thus\nenforce the legal rules as they are announced, regardless of the\njudge\u2019s own view of the desirability of the legal rule or its\nimpact on her personally. Political economy assumes that public\nofficials have the same motivation as private individuals; they are\nself-interested (or subject to the same biases that private\nindividuals are). In the context of adjudication, as will be\nelaborated below, the political economist interprets self-interested\njudicial behavior as decisions that promote the policy preferences of\nthe judge. Doctrinal analysis does not analyze the behavior of public\nofficials; it rationalizes the decisions of judges without necessarily\nimputing motivations to them.\n\nSecond, policy analysis and doctrinal analysis generally adopt a\nwelfarist stance towards evaluation of legal rules, while political\neconomy has evolved from a more contractarian tradition. Policy\nanalysts, when evaluating legal rules, ask whether that legal rule\ninduces behavior that satisfies some welfarist criterion, usually\neither Pareto efficiency or (constrained) social welfare\n maximization.[5]\n Political economy, however, has to a large extent emerged from an\neconomic tradition, exemplified by James\n Buchanan,[6]\n that rejects the maximization of social welfare as a criterion and\nseeks to evaluate political institutions on grounds of (actual or\nhypothetical) consent. The political economist often asks not whether\nthe rule induces Pareto efficiency but whether the parties have acted\nvoluntarily, consented to the rule, or would have (rationally)\nconsented to the rule.\n\nFinally, we might understand the distinction among the three strands\nas a difference in the view each adopts about the instrumentalism of\nlaw. \u201cInstrumentalism\u201d here means that an agent designs\nthe law to promote some collective goal. Kornhauser [2000, 2010]\ndiscuss this idea at length. For our purposes, we need only note\nseveral ambiguities in the brief definition just given. A more careful\ndefinition would specify the agent who designs, the meaning of design,\nwhat counts as \u201claw,\u201d and what is a collective purpose.\nRight now, we note only that instrumentalism may occur at the level of\nthe rule, the institution or the legal system as a whole.\n\nPolicy analysis tends to proceed legal rule by legal rule. It asks,\nfor example, how does a change in the standard of care affect the\nbehavior of tortfeasors and tort victims? Or how does contracting\nbehavior differ if the measure of damages shifts from expectation\ndamages to reliance damages? The analyst thus imputes a purpose\n(usually, but not necessarily, the maximization of social welfare) to\nthe promulgator of the legal rule. The analyst then assumes that the\npolicymaker has chosen the legal rule that best promotes her (imputed)\nobjective. Legal rules are then instrumental to the achievement of the\nposited goal; call this approach rule instrumentalism.\n\nThe political economist, by contrast, generally denies that any\npurpose can be attributed to the promulgator of a legal rule largely\nbecause legal rules are not promulgated by a single individual with\npower unilaterally to control the content of the rule. Certainly, from\nthe perspective of political economy, legislators have no common\npurpose and one should not assume or expect that any statute maximizes\nsocial welfare. Legislation results from the interplay of interest\ngroups that do not reflect all interests within society. Even if the\nlegislature did reflect all interests within society, each interest\ndoes not have an equal (or proportionate) say in the formulation of\nthe\n statute.[7]\n Finally, even if each interest did play a \u201cproportionate\u201d\nrole in the formulation of the statute, Arrow\u2019s General\nPossibility Theorem teaches that the aggregation of interests might\nstill not yield a coherent purpose. Political economy thus rejects\nrule instrumentalism.\n\nFurther understanding of the approach of political economy requires\nacknowledgment of divergent views within political economy. I\ndistinguish two such views: constitutional political economy\nand radical political economy. Each rejects rule\ninstrumentalism but only the latter rejects instrumentalism\naltogether.\n\nOne might attribute the rejection of rule instrumentalism within\npolitical economy to a commitment to an explanatory rather than a\nnormative project. At the level of constitutional political economy,\nhowever, the research program usually adopts the perspective of a\nconstitutional designer and this designer arguably has a view of law\nthat includes institutional instrumentalism: i.e., legal\ninstitutions, rather than specific legal rules, promote the specific\ngoals of the constitutional\n designer.[8]\n The constitutional designer seeks a political structure that promotes\nher goals. The project of constitutional political economy is thus\nnormative in nature. Indeed the normative nature of the project\ndominates any explanatory aim. Many within the project \u2014 see\nBrennan and Buchanan [1981, 1985] \u2014 argue that one ought to\nadopt an economic theory of behavior of public officials and private\nindividuals even if that theory is not the best explanatory\ntheory.\n\nRadical political economists reject this reasoning. They carry the\nlogic of the argument about the incoherence of legislative behavior\nthrough to the level of institutional and constitutional design.\nConstitutions are drafted by agents with political and economic\ninterests that they seek to forward when they create the basic social,\neconomic, and political institutions of the society. Incoherence may\nthus infect these institutions as well. The compromises over slavery\nin the US Constitution, for example, illustrate, when viewed against\nthe democratic and equality elements of the document, such\nincoherence. Radical political economists thus reject the claim that\nthe law is designed and hence reject instrumentalism\naltogether.\n\nThe relation of doctrinal analysis to instrumentalism depends on our\nunderstanding of the project of doctrinal analysis. If we understand\ndoctrinal analysis simply as a rationalization of doctrine, it would\nappear to make no assumptions about the instrumental nature of law.\nThe fact that doctrine is efficient might result from intentional\nbehavior on the part of agents or might simply emerge from the\nstructure of the institutions within which public officials work. On\nthe other hand, if we understand doctrinal analysis as a theory of\nadjudication, then it clearly adopts a rule instrumental view of law.\nThe project of doctrinal analysis is discussed at greater length in\nthe next section.\n\nThese differences in the level at which law is instrumental, if the\nlaw is instrumental at all, suggest that the three strands of economic\nanalysis of law will adopt different approaches to the study of\nadjudication. These theories are sketched and discussed in section 5\nbelow.\n\nMore significantly for purposes of this entry, however, the classical\nvariants of both policy analysis and political economy adopt the\nstandard assumption of neo-classical economics that each individual\nseeks to maximize the satisfaction of her preferences. Moreover, they\ngenerally assume that each individual acts in her own self-interest,\nnarrowly defined. This approach presents the single, greatest obstacle\nto the articulation of a general theory of law that confronts economic\nanalysis: it has no room for the normative aspect of law. It\nis this denial of the normativity of law that accounts for the\nvehement resistance that economic analysis provoked within the legal\nacademy.\n2. Doctrinal Analysis\n\nDoctrine organizes the vast legal materials of advanced societies as\nwell as legal education and much of legal scholarship. First year law\nstudents study basic common law courses such as tort and contract;\nupper year courses address subjects such as antitrust, business\norganizations, and administrative law. The casebooks in these courses\nare organized doctrinally. Similarly, legal scholars typically\nspecialize in the study of one or two doctrinal areas. \n\nPosner was trained as a lawyer. Posner [1973] was organized\ndoctrinally. Leff [1973] described Posner [1973] as a picaresque novel\nin which the eponymous protagonist Economic Analysis traveled down the\nriver of doctrinal subjects, offering insight into each set of legal\nrules. Most current work in the field still analyzes some doctrinal\nrule, typically assessing its efficiency.\n2.1 Doctrinal Analysis as a Rationalization of Private Law\n\nScholars thus generally consider doctrinal analysis the core project\nwithin economic analysis of\n law.[9]\n Certainly, legal scholars who work in the central private law areas\nof tort, contract, and property typically understand economic analysis\nof law as doctrinal analysis. This doctrinal analysis has provoked\nsubstantial philosophical attention and critique.\n\nCritiques fall roughly into two groups. The first accepts the\ninstrumentalism of law, at one level or another. It rejects, however,\neither efficiency as the aim of the designer or the assumption of\nrationality underlying any behavioral claim that may be implicated in\na rationalization of doctrine. Issues related to the efficiency\ncriterion are discussed below in section 6. The rejection of economic\nrationality generally rests on its failure to accommodate normativity,\nan issue we discuss in section 4.\n\nThe second set of critics have offered a panoply of alternative\nexplanations of the relevant area of law. These alternative\nexplanations share two features. First, they all take the language of\n\u201cobligation\u201d seriously. Second, and related, they all\nreject the view of doctrine as instrumental. Following Ripstein\n[2016], we shall call these alternative theories deontic\ntheories.\n\nTo assess the debate, however, one must first determine how each side\nin the controversy understands the nature of doctrine and what counts\nas an explanation of it. Phrased differently, we must answer a\nsubstantive and a methodological question: what is private law theory\n(or doctrinal analysis of private law) a theory of? And against what\ncriteria do we assess such theories? \n\nTo begin, consider the substantive question. This question has two\naspects: a jurisdictional aspect and a \u201ctextual\u201d aspect.\nConsider the textual aspect first. In doctrinal analysis, economic\nanalysts of law seek to explain the outcomes of cases. An\n\u201coutcome\u201d here means the disposition of the case;\nthe disposition of a case identifies the party that prevailed in the\nlitigation, i.e, on the facts of the case, whether defendant was\nresponsible or\n not.[10].\n The critics of economic analysis of law understand the task of\ndoctrinal analysis differently. Explaining doctrine requires an\nexplanation not of the dispositions of decided cases but of the\nreasoning of those cases and, often, structural and procedural\nfeatures of the litigation that gives rise to the\n reasons.[11]\n\nThe position of the critics is at least perplexing and arguably\nproblematic. They apparently regard dispositions as mere applications\nof law to fact. Yet the practice of common law adjudication arguably\ntreats the disposition as fundamental, i.e., as the aspect of the\ndecision that requires respect. The priority of the disposition over\nthe rule fits the English practice of seriatim  opinions\nwell. In such a practice, each judge offers her reasons for the\ndisposition and may articulate rules. There are no reasons for\ndispositions or rules announced by the court. The court,\nhowever, does announce a disposition.\n\nSimilarly, it is not clear why an account of doctrine\nrequires a rationalization of the bilateral nature of private law\nlitigation. Critics (such as Coleman [2001], Ripstein [2016] and\nWeinrib [1995]) of the doctrinal analysis project in economic analysis\nof law consider this bilateral nature\u2014the fact that\nthis plaintiff sues that defendant and not someone\nelse\u2014essential. They point to the doctrinal analysts\u2019\nfailure to provide an essential explanation as an important aspect of\nthe superiority of their account of private law.\n\nThough the critics are correct that doctrinal analysis does not\nconsider the bilateral structure of private law as essential, it\nnonetheless can account both for how it emerged and why it persists.\nAt the time of the emergence of private law, states were relatively\nsmall and had little capacity to monitor and enforce rules and\nregulations. Indeed, Henry II arguably introduced the common law\ncourts to exert his power more broadly within England. At the time of\nthe emergence of these private law institutions, there were no\nalternative institutions available to induce the desired behavior.\n\n\nMoreover, the bilateral structure of private law exploits the private\ninformation of injured plaintiffs in enforcing the law. It is costly\nfor the state to monitor everyone\u2019s behavior; it is difficult to\nobserve behavior that does not comply with announced norms. Injured\nvictims, however, are well-placed\u2014and, when the law enforces\nmonetary claims for non-compliant behavior, injured victims have the\nincentive\u2014to observe non-compliant behavior. The state\nfrequently exploits this informational advantage of victims by\ncreating private actions as in the antitrust and employment\ndiscrimination regimes in the United States. \n\nThe systematic use of these \u201cprivate attorneys general\u201d to\npromote public interests points to a deeper reason why the critics err\nwhen they treat the bilateral nature of private litigation as\nessential. This \u201cbilateral nature\u201d is a feature not simply\nof private law adjudication but of adjudication generally. Its\nexplanation should therefore not rest on features peculiar to private\nlaw but on something fundamental to adjudication generally.\n\nTurn now to the jurisdictional aspect of the substantive question.\nWhich outcomes do doctrinal analysts rationalize? The reasoning of\nwhich opinions do the critics analyze? For a practicing lawyer, these\nquestions have an obvious answer: analyze the outcomes or reasoning of\nthe cases in the jurisdiction the law of which applies to the dispute.\nOn this account, we would have a doctrinal analysis of, say, the\ncontract law of New Jersey or the libel law of Montana. Private law\ntheorists, however, have broader ambitions; they seek a more general\ntheory though it is unclear how to generalize from the doctrine of\njurisdiction J to doctrine in the abstract.\n\nDoctrinal analysts within economic analysis of law face a somewhat\nlesser difficulty. Their project simply asks whether a legal rule that\nrationalizes a pattern of outcomes induces efficient behavior (perhaps\nwithin some model). One can pursue this task rule-by-rule and\nindependently of the jurisdiction. The general claim then states\nsimply that the doctrine in most jurisdictions is by-and-large\nrationalized by rules that induce efficient behavior. As more than one\nrule governing the same conduct may induce efficient behavior, there\nis no implication that rules are identical in different\n jurisdictions.[12]\n\n\nFor the critics, however, the problem seems deeper. Some structural\nfeatures of private law may not vary across jurisdictions but the\nrules and the reasons for them do. It is less clear how one explains a\nmass of reasons and rules from different jurisdictions. The difficulty\nincreases the more diverse the set of jurisdictions is. We might\nexpect tort law in the United States to be relatively uniform across\nthe fifty states. After all, the states largely share an approach to\nopinion writing and judges of one state may refer to the decisions of\nanother. We would expect courts from different states to offer similar\n types of reasons. That unity might decrease if we consider\nall common law jurisdictions. After all, the conventions of opinion\nwriting vary across these jurisdictions. Opinions issued from the\njudges of the Queen\u2019s Bench do not obviously offer similar types\nof reasons as those issued by the California Supreme Court. An\nexpansion to civil law jurisdictions increases the range of styles.\nOpinions of the French Cour de Cassation look nothing like the\nopinions of the two previously mentioned common law courts.\n\nThough doctrinal analysts have not been methodologically\nself-conscious, several private law theorists\u2014e.g., Coleman\n[2001], Kraus [2002], Smith [2006], and Ripstein [2016]\u2014have\noutlined the requirements that a theory of private law must satisfy.\nThese authors have articulated at least three criteria that apply to\nthe evaluation of theories of private law: fit, transparency, and\ndeterminancy.\n\n\u201cFit,\u201d of course, refers to the extent to which the theory\naccounts for the observed phenomena\u2014for the doctrinal economic\nanalysts, the extent to which it accounts for the observed outcomes\nand for the deontic critics the extent to which it accounts for the\nreasoning of the courts and the relevant structural features. Though\ncomparing degrees of fit across interpretations may be difficult, fit\nis uncontroversial as a criterion.\n\n\u201cTransparency\u201d requires that the explanation be internal\nrather than external in the sense that the explanation relies on\nconcepts deployed by judges and other actors producing the outcomes\nand reasoning to be explained. Doctrinal analysis, according to the\ncritics, fails as an explanation of private law because it is opaque\nrather than transparent. Indeed, most of the criticisms of doctrinal\nanalysis reduce, in one way or another, either to a claim that (1) it\nfails to satisfy transparency or (2) as discussed above, it fails to\naccount for the bilateral nature of private law. \n\nTransparency, however, seems an important theoretical ambition only\nfor some accounts of doctrinal analysis. Most obviously, the content\nclaim (claim II) that holds that efficiency determines the content of\nthe law requires transparency when we interpret it as part of the rule\nof recognition. But neither the explanatory claim (claim I) nor the\ndoctrinal claim (claim III) presuppose transparency. The content of a\nlegal rule may be efficient even if judges do not aim at efficiency.\nAn external account of the explanatory claim, however, provides an\nincomplete explanation until it identifies some mechanism that\nexplains how judges, unconcerned about efficiency, nevertheless\ngenerally announce efficient\n rules.[13]\n Similarly, the doctrinal claim (claim III) that efficiency\nrationalizes the outcomes reached by the common law does not\nnecessarily require transparency. \n\n\u201cDeterminacy\u201d requires an explanation to make a clear\nprediction of the application of legal rules to facts. Doctrinal\nanalysis often satisfies this criterion; indeed, to the extent it\nseeks to rationalize dispositions, any successful doctrinal analysis\nmust make such predictions. An explanation in doctrinal analysis\nidentifies some \u201cefficient\u201d rule and this rule is\ndeterminate in the sense that it dictates a precise outcome or\ndisposition in specific cases. On the other hand, efficient rules are\noften not unique; more than one rule will induce efficient behavior\nand these rules will not necessarily dictate the same disposition of a\n case.[14]\n\nDeontic theories, by contrast, fare badly under the determinacy\ncriterion. This lack of success may follow from the choice of subject\nmatter to explain. These theories focus on the rules not the\ndispositions.\n\nDeontic critics also reject the instrumentalism of doctrinal analysis.\nDoctrinal analysis treats the law as a means to the end of inducing\nefficient behavior. The value of legal rules derives solely from the\nvalue of the goal sought. On the deontic accounts, by contrast, the\npoint of the law is to do justice between the parties. \n2.2 Doctrinal Analysis as a Concept of Law?\n\nDoes doctrinal analysis implicitly or explicitly rely on some theory\nof law? It might be understood in a number of ways. It might be\nunderstood as the content claim (claim II) that holds that an\nefficiency criterion identifies the content of the law. The literature\ncontains arguments that virtually every (common law) legal rule is\nefficient. This claim has both an empirical interpretation that each\nlegal rule induces efficient behavior and a doctrinal interpretation\nthat the prevailing legal rule is identified by its efficiency. The\nliterature, however, has offered scant explanation or justification\nfor the underlying theoretical claim that efficiency\nidentifies the content of these legal norms. On what theory\nof law does efficiency become a ground of law?\n\nOne might justify the content in a variety of ways. A legal positivist\nmight argue that the rule of recognition identifies efficiency as an\nappropriate ground of judge-made law. Or one might argue, as Dworkin\nhas suggested, that efficiency provides the best interpretation of the\npractice governing the law of accidents. On either account, the claim\nthat efficiency identifies the content of the law is a contingent\nclaim. For the positivist, the content of the rule of recognition is\ncontingent on the social practice of the relevant public officials;\nthey may, but they need not, adopt an efficiency\n criterion.[15]\n Similarly, for Dworkin, the law derives from the best interpretation\nof the past political decisions of the community. These decisions are\nof course contingent; a different history of decisions might yield a\ndifferent account of law. Claim (II) thus does not constitute a\ncompeting concept of law.\n3. The Nature of Law\n\nPhilosophical inquiries into the nature of law have generally gone\nunder the rubric \u201cthe concept of law.\u201d Unfortunately, as\nmultiple projects and questions fall under this single rubric, the\ndebate has generated more confusion than clarity. This section seeks\nfirst to disentangle the various questions that have been conflated\nwithin a single concept of law.\n\nThe section then focuses on two of those concepts, identified in the\nnext subsection as the doctrinal and sociological (or social\nscientific) concepts of law. We argue first that economic analysis of\nlaw is not committed to any specific doctrinal concept. Second, and\nfinally, we argue that economic methodology does suggest how to define\na sociological concept of law that is parasitic on a concept of\ngovernance and on the value of legality. \n3.1 Concepts of Law\n\nSince Dworkin\u2019s initial challenge to Hart\u2019s positivism in\nthe mid-1960s, a robust but unresolved debate over the concept of law\nhas riven the philosophy of law. Hart [1994] viewed this debate with\nsome perplexity as he thought the two sides had not engaged. More\npointedly, he thought there was nothing to argue about as he felt that\nhe and Dworkin asked two different questions; and, consequently,\nexplicated two distinct concepts of law. \n\nDworkin [1986] considered identification of the grounds of\nlaw the central question for the philosophy of law. The grounds\nof law identify the truth conditions of propositions of law. The\ndoctrinal concept of law answered this question. For him, the\njurisprudential debate thus focused on whether the grounds of law\nincluded moral principles or not. Implicitly, then, Dworkin\ninterpreted Hart [1961] as centrally addressing this doctrinal\nquestion. \n\nHart, by contrast, did not understand his project as centrally focused\non the grounds of law. Hart [1961] offered various, non-equivalent\ncharacterizations of his central task. In the first chapter, he\nsuggests as a central aim the differentiation of law from a variety of\nother phenomena, specifically morality, religion, and coercion. In the\npreface, however, Hart suggests that his study might be regarded as an\nessay in \u201cdescriptive sociology.\u201d The answer to the former\nquestion would rely on what Dworkin [2006] called a taxonomic\nconcept of law that distinguished law from other social phenomena; the\nlatter question, by contrast, demands what Dworkin [2006] called a\nsociological concept of law that furthers the aims of social\nscience.\n\nBefore identifying further concepts of law, it is important to\nunderstand how the taxonomic and the sociological concepts of law\ndiffer. A taxonomic concept of law has two functions. As noted, it\ndistinguishes legal norms in society S from other norms in that\nsociety. Second, and derivatively, it makes comparative law possible.\nComparative law must identify which rules and institutions to compare\nacross societies. A comparative study of tort law, for instance, must\nbe able to identify which norms in country X are legal norms governing\naccidents between strangers in order to compare them to the legal\nnorms governing accidents between strangers in country Y. \n\nThe sociological concept, by contrast, must serve the needs of social\ntheorists who seek to understand society and social behavior. It will\nbe a technical concept that emerges from the theory or theories that\nbest explain the phenomena the social theorist studies. Note,\nmoreover, that a social scientist might require more than one concept\nof law. Hart\u2019s descriptive sociology might be interpreted as\noffering a functional concept of law. Anthropologists, by\ncontrast, often seem more interested in an  expressive\nconcept of law. (See Pirie [2010] for a discussion that suggests an\nexpressive account of the concept of law.) \n\nThe doctrinal, taxonomic and (various) sociological concepts of law do\nnot exhaust the possible concepts that might be useful. Obviously, we\nrequire, for instance, an evaluative concept of law that\nidentifies the value of legality. Similarly, some legal philosophers,\nsuch as Raz and Coleman, understand the inquiry as an investigation of\na folk concept of law that underlies ordinary usage of the\nterm. This folk concept will differ from the other concepts of law but\nit may be influenced (or perhaps tainted) by the others, particularly\nthe doctrinal and evaluative concepts. Kornhauser [forthcoming] offers\nan achievement concept of law according to which law is a contingent\nachievement of a functioning governance system in specific\ncircumstances. It realizes some value of legality. This view is\nelaborated at greater length in section 3.3. \n\nA complex web of relations might connect these various concepts.\nHart\u2019s theory does yield a ground of law, and hence a doctrinal\nconcept, from his sociological or taxonomic concept. What makes a\nproposition of law true, for Hart, is its pedigree which must trace\nback ultimately to the rule of recognition in the community.\nSimilarly, we might create a taxonomy by considering how the grounds\nof law differ from the grounds of morality or religion. A taxonomy,\nthat is, follows directly from comparing truth conditions for\npropositions of law to truth conditions for propositions of morality.\n\n\nNo necessary relation, however, holds among the concepts. One might\nhave a sociological concept of law that does not rely on the doctrinal\nconcept of law as their grounds are very different. What makes a\nproposition of law true bears no obvious relation to what concepts\nwill shed light on questions of interest to social theorists.\n3.2 The Doctrinal Concept of Law in Economic Analysis of Law\n\nThe prior section identified a plethora of concepts of law. On which\nof these concepts does economic analysis of law rely? On which of\nthese concepts does it shed light? This section addresses these\nquestions with respect to the doctrinal concept of law that lies at\nthe center of legal practice. The next section addresses these\nquestions with respect to the sociological concept of law that might\nplay a role in the development of social theory.\n\nMost doctrinal analyses take the \u201clegal materials\u201d as\ngiven. They seek to rationalize the decisions of some set of courts.\nAny concept of law that identifies the materials as the relevant ones\nto rationalize serves the doctrinal analysts\u2019 purposes.\n\nPolicy analysis and political economy have also largely been silent\nabout the doctrinal concept of law on which they rely or shed light.\nEach has largely put the questions that motivate the debates over the\nconcept of law to one side.\n\nAn economic analysis of the behavioral effects of a legal rule\ngenerally begins with the assumption that the legal rule is clearly\nknown not only to judges and other public officials but also to those\nsubject to the legal rule. This knowledge of private citizens might\namount simply to the knowledge of what consequences follow from each\npossible action the agent might take. Actions that provoke a response\nfrom public officials generally, or judges in particular, have no\nspecial character to them; the citizen in her deliberations treats the\nconsequences of rule-following or rule-breaking as she treats any\nother price.\n\nSimilarly, investigations into the causes of legal rules and\ninstitutions typically take the background institutions and rules as\ngiven and, generally, known to all parties. It is not clear that the\nanalysis attributes any special character to legal rules and\ninstitutions other than, perhaps, centralized legislation,\nadjudication, and\n enforcement.[16]\n Thus political economy, like policy analysis, seems agnostic about\nthe central philosophical questions. Nothing in the analysis requires\nthat legal rules be distinctive in any way. Indeed, radical political\neconomy holds that self-interest governs individual and institutional\naction all the way down. It leaves no room for any normative force to\nlaw. \n\nThis agnosticism about the doctrinal concept of law is, on two\naccounts, harmless. First, as Murphy [2014] argues, competing\npositions on the role of morality in the truth conditions of\npropositions of law do not have many, if any, substantive consequences\nfor the practice of law. Ignoring the doctrinal concept of law thus\nhas no substantive consequence for economic analyses of these rules.\n\n\nSecond, as argued in Kornhauser [2015], a doctrinal concept of law is\nunnecessary for the practice of law. What legal theory requires is not\na doctrinal concept of law but a set of theories of decision-making\nfor various agents\u2014judges, legislators, public officials, and\ncitizens. \n3.3 Law as an Achievement: Towards a Social Scientific Concept of Law?\n\nBoth policy analysis and political economy pursue projects\nsubstantially different from the philosophical ones. Policy analysis\nseeks to understand how legal rules influence behavior; political\neconomy seeks to understand the ways in which society structures its\npolitical, economic, and legal institutions. These projects suggest a\nsocial scientific concept of law rather than a doctrinal or taxonomic\none. A social-scientific concept of law would help us understand the\nsocial world in general, the emergence and persistence of social\ngroups over time and the causes and consequences of different\ngovernmental structures. Political economy and policy analysis, or a\ngeneral sociology, then seek to answer the question: How do we\ndifferentiate the structures of social governance in order to\nunderstand social phenomena? \n\nAn understanding of society and social phenomena, of course, may not\nrequire anything akin to the concept of law at issue in the\nphilosophical debates. Two different reasons, however, suggest some\nrelation between the philosophical debate and the social-scientific\ninquiry. One should recall that Hart [1961] characterized, perhaps\noff-handedly, his project as one in the descriptive sociology of law.\nSuch a sociological project presumably requires a social scientific\nconcept of law. Moreover, once one has articulated a viable and useful\nset of social-scientific concepts, one might ask what relation they\nbear to the issues at the center of the philosophical inquiries of the\nvalue of legality and of articulating the criterion that distinguishes\nlegal from other grounds of decision. \n\nAdopting Hart\u2019s discussion as a starting point, we shall in the\nrest of this subsection, sketch a social-scientific concept of a\ngovernance structure and suggest how it might relate both to the\nproject of political economy and to the philosophical debate over the\nconcept of law. (Kornhauser [2004, 2015, forthcoming] provide a more\nextended account.)\n\nOne of Hart\u2019s rhetorical devices provides a useful starting\npoint for the development of a social scientific (functional) concept\nof governance. To introduce the concept of a secondary rule, Hart\n[1961] recounts a fable concerning the emergence of a legal system in\na small community. He suggests that a small, homogeneous, stable, and\nclosely knit society requires no differentiated structures of\ngovernance. These structures emerge to resolve problems that arise in\nsocieties that are large, heterogeneous, or subject to environmental\nuncertainty. Though Hart identifies only three such problems, we shall\nidentify four distinct functions that might be distributed across\nsocietal structures: (1) the characterization of socially acceptable\n(or unacceptable) behavior, a task the importance of which grows as\nthe rate of change in society increases;(2) policing of behavior to\nidentify likely instances of deviant behavior; more anonymous\nsocieties may require more institutionalized policing; (3) definitive\nadjudication of non-conformity to social norms; again, when society is\nno longer face-to-face, such adjudication may be necessary to trigger\nsanctions; and (4)sanctioning of deviant behavior; informal sanctions\ngrow more difficult to impose when society is not face-to-face.\n\nGovernance within a society requires that the society somehow\naccomplish each of these four tasks. A society might do so in a number\nof different ways. A governance structure is the set of institutional\nstructures within a society that address one or more of the four\nproblems of adaptation, detection, application, and sanction that are\nthe central elements of governance. An institutional structure is a\ndecision-making protocol that specifies procedures relevant to the\nresolution of one or more of the problems of adaptation, detection,\napplication, and sanction. Clear understanding requires a distinction\nhere between institutional structures, realized institutions, and\nfunctioning institutions. This distinction parallels the distinction\nbetween game forms, games, and plays of a game in the theory of games.\nAs noted before, an institutional structure is simply the basic rules\nor protocol for governance; a realized institution is an institutional\nstructure situated in a given society and populated by particular\nindividuals; and a functioning institution is a realized institution\nas it operates in a society in actual conditions.\n\nAll societies have governance structures. The simplest, face-to-face\nsocieties have undifferentiated structures in which all of these\nfunctions are informal and diffused through the society. As social\ngroups grow more numerous and their environment becomes more volatile,\ngovernance structures become more complex.\n\nA crude taxonomy of governance structures might distinguish them along\nthree dimensions: the degree of institutional differentiation in the\ngovernance structure, the degree of organization (or\n\u201cdirection,\u201d or \u201cstructure)\u201d \u2013 for\nfurther discussion see Kornhauser [forthcoming] \u2013 and the\nmechanism of internal, \u201cbureaucratic\u201d control. \n\nA governance structure may be more or less differentiated from other\ninstitutions (such as those governing exchange or reproduction) in a\nsociety. Hart considered two extremes: a simple society with no\ndifferentiation of governance from other institutions and modern,\nmunicipal legal systems that have distinct institutions for\nadaptation, policing, adjudication, and sanctioning. Indeed, a society\nsuch as the United States has multiple legislative, executive and\njudicial institutions that relate in complex ways. \n\n\u201cOrganization\u201d refers to the degree to which governance in\na given realm or of a given function (such as norm creation or norm\nmonitoring) are \u201ccentralized\u201d or \u201cdirected\u201d by\nspecified individuals. Simple, face-to-face societies typically have\ndecentralized (and undifferentiated) institutions. The community as a\nwhole monitors compliance and sanctions non-compliance. Private law is\ntypically monitored in this decentralized way. Modern municipal legal\nsystems, by contrast, are typically more structured and organized.\n\n\nThe mechanism of internal control refers to the character type that\nthe governance institutions (seek to) select for public officials. As\nnoted above, governance depends on who occupies official roles;\ngovernance structures function differently when public officials are\nself-interested rather than when they are conscientious. Hart\ncontrasted two motivations for compliance with law or legal\nobligations: incentives that rely on the self-interest of individuals\nand acceptance of rules as guides to action. For Hart, law required\nthat a core set of public officials had to accept the rule of\nrecognition as an authoritative guide to action. \n\nPolitical economy, by contrast, aims to explain all legal phenomena in\nterms of the self-interest of agents. This analytic strategy precludes\na Hartian account of law; legal rules cannot play any role in the\nexplanation of behavior of either private individuals or public\nofficials because no agent has the relevant internal attitude towards\nthe rule. An individual faced with a choice considers the costs and\nbenefits that each option presents to her. These costs and benefits\nwill include \u201clegal costs and benefits\u201d but these costs\nand benefits are not determined by rules; they are the result of the\nincentives that private and public officials face. Rules are only\nrules of thumb that express the response of average individuals under\nnormal circumstances to particular events. Which rules of thumb are\nused, of course, may greatly affect the social equilibrium achieved in\na particular jurisdiction.\n\nPolitical economy thus seeks a concept of governance that relies only\non incentives; it consequently denies the existence of legal systems\nin Hart\u2019s sense. It might nonetheless acknowledge a different\nconcept of law. Some political economists, for example, suggest that\nlegality in the sense of an impartial \u201crule of law\u201d\npromotes economic growth. The political economist then might identify\nlaw or legal systems as those governance structures that realize such\na rule of law (in given circumstances). The political economist, then,\nmight adopt two related concepts. The first concept of a governance\nstructure is an explanatory one; it characterizes the mechanisms of\nsocial governance in terms of the degree of institutional\ndifferentiation and the mechanism of bureaucratic control within these\ninstitutions. The second related concept is normative. It identifies a\nvalue that a governance structure might realize. Call this value\nlegality. The concept of law is thus a normative one; that\nidentifies the value of legality. The social scientist then seeks to\nidentify conditions under which specific governance structures will\nrealize the value of legality.\n\nThe above discussion sketches a concept of governance, a concept\nclearly necessary for social science. We might understand law in two\ndistinct ways. The first, traditional way regards law as a\nmode of governance, or, we might say, as a species of\ngovernance. On this account, some specific feature or features of a\nfunctioning governance system characterize law; these features\nidentify the \u201cessence\u201d of law. Debates about the concept\nof law are thus debates over the features that are essential for law.\n\n\nThe alternative approach understands law as an achievement of\na functioning governance system. On this account, the essence of law\nlies in the character of the achievement, i.e., in the value of\n\u201clegality\u201d that the functioning governance system\nrealizes. Debates about the concept of law on this achievement account\nare thus debates over the nature of the value of legality.\n4. The Normativity of Law\n\nTraditional approaches to law treat legal rules as normative,\ni.e., as giving citizens reasons for action. These approaches present\ntwo philosophical questions: what is the nature of the reasons for\naction that law gives? and do individuals have a general obligation to\nobey the law? The first question is generally understood as asking\nwhether a legal rule provides a moral reason for action. The second\nquestion has been extensively examined in the legal and philosophical\nliterature. Murphy [2014] provides a clear perspective on this\nliterature.\n\nClaims (IV) and (V) assert that individuals respond to legal rules in\nan economic way. On classical economic accounts of rationality, an\neconomic response is a prudential rather than a moral response. Legal\nrules, on the economic account, thus do give individuals reasons to\nact, but they are not regarded as moral reasons. A traffic sign\ndesignating a street as within a school zone both indicates that\nchildren may dart into the street and sets a reduced speed limit. Each\nof these indication provides the agent with reasons for action. The\nrule thus affects the agent\u2019s behavior by affecting his beliefs\nabout the likelihood of a causing an injury when traveling at various\nspeeds and his beliefs about the expected costs of different courses\nof conduct. The sign and the legal rule give the agent prudential\nreasons for action. Economic analysis of law in its current form thus\nlargely adopts the Holmesian \u201cbad man\u201d theory of law.\n\nCritics of economic analysis of law contend that this failure to\naddress the normativity of law provides ample grounds on which to\nreject its adequacy as a theory of law. This argument, however, does\nnot satisfactorily address two questions.\n\nTo understand the first question, recall that, in the projects of\npolicy analysis and political economy, micro-economic theory serves as\na positive theory of behavior. For the critics\u2019 objection to\napply, then, the normativity of law must have behavioral implications.\nLegal obligation thus must influence behavior. Whether the economic\ntheory of behavior can accommodate legal normativity must depend on\nwhat behavior that normativity induces. \n\nPhilosophers, however, have not addressed this question. Their\ninvestigations of practical reason generally and of legal reasons in\nparticular typically understand their inquiry as setting the\nrequirements of practical rationality not as being an actual theory of\nbehavior.\n\nThe second question arises once the implications of legal normativity\nfor behavior have been identified. Can the economic theory of behavior\naccommodate the requisite normative behavior?\n\u201cAccommodation\u201d in this context means that economic theory\ncan generate models that predict the behavior that a legal obligation\ninduces. Clearly, standard economic models do not attempt to\naccommodate normativity. The economic theory of behavior, however, is\nvery flexible. Section 4.3 suggests some basic strategies that\neconomic theorists might adopt to accommodate normativity. \n\nTo set the stage for this analysis, we first set out a simple example\nof choice against which to assess different understandings of\nbehavior. We then consider why philosophers of law and lawyers\ngenerally might think that law provides non-prudential reasons for\naction.\n4.1 Interpreting Choice\n\nConsider Liza who has gone to a restaurant with friends. The menu\noffers two main courses: beef and tofu. Liza must choose one. Suppose\nLiza chooses tofu. How can we understand or rationalize her\nchoice?\n\nA rational choice explanation will refer to her preferences, her\nbeliefs, and the environment in which she chooses. Liza might choose\ntofu because she prefers tofu to meat. She might choose tofu because\nshe prefers healthy meals to unhealthy meals and she believes that\ntofu is healthier than meat. She might choose tofu because she is\nbudget-constrained and tofu is cheaper than meat. Or Liza might have\nmore complex preferences. Perhaps all of Liza\u2019s friends have\nchosen tofu and Liza has a taste for conformity.\n\nSuppose, however, that Liza believes that it is wrong to inflict pain\non sentient creatures. She believes she has a moral obligation not to\neat meat. She thus chooses tofu. How does the rational choice model\naccommodate this belief? It might accommodate this moral attitude by\nincorporating it into her preferences in one of two ways. Liza, that\nis, might internalize the norm in two distinct ways. Liza might\ndevelop a substantive preference for tofu over meat. She would\ninternalize the content of the norm. On this account, if her\nmoral view changed, Liza\u2019s preference for tofu over meat would\nremain. The moral norm, or Liza\u2019s endorsement of that norm,\nwould not have had any (direct) influence on her behavior. \n\nOr she might have a preference for norm compliance; that is, all other\nthings equal, she prefers actions that conform to the norm to actions\nthat violate it. One might say that Liza incurs a \u201ccost\u201d\nfrom non-compliance with a norm. Then, if she prefers meat to tofu,\nall else equal, she will choose tofu when the cost of norm violation\nis sufficiently high. If Liza\u2019s moral views changed, she would\nrevert to eating meat. The two forms of internalization thus yield\ndifferent behavioral predictions. This account of normativity,\nhowever, has an ad hoc quality to it as the cost of norm violation is\nnot directly observable. \n4.2 Legal Form\n\nLegal regulation takes a number of distinct legal forms to which\nlegislators and judges pay strict attention. The state might impose,\non the same conduct, one or more of the following forms of regulation:\ncriminal penalties, a civil fine, an administrative fine, a tax, a\nlicense, or a private civil action. Different forms of regulation\nclearly have different expressive features. But typically the legal\nprofession and the public may think the different forms have different\nbehavioral consequences. These different behavioral consequences may\nsuggest that the law, or at least the form the legal regulation takes,\nprovides distinctive reasons for action.\n\nContrast, for example, enforcing an air pollution emission standard\nthrough a criminal penalty rather than a tax. The two regulatory\nregimes clearly express different attitudes towards emissions. The\ncriminal penalty prohibits emissions (above the stated\nstandard); the tax permits emissions (above the stated\nstandard). Lawyers tend to believe that a criminal prohibition will\nreduce emissions more than the tax. \n\nSimilarly, a city might redesignate a section of the curb from\n\u201cno parking,\u201d enforced by an administrative fine to\nmetered parking. The \u201cno parking\u201d designation prohibits\nparking in the identified zone while meters permit parking upon\npayment of the (licensing) fee. The city presumably expects that,\nunder \u201cno parking\u201d, the stretch of curb will remain clear,\nwhile it expects cars to use the same stretch when parking is metered.\nThe distinction between a prohibition and a permission clearly has\nexpressive\n content.[17]\n\n\nThese legal forms, of course, differ not only in their expressive\ncontent but also in their substantive features. Monitoring for\ncriminal violations differs dramatically from monitoring for\nregulation through a private civil action. In the latter case, private\ncitizens identify violations of the standard; in the former,\ngovernment officials police the regulated conduct. Further, the fora\nin which violations are adjudicated may differ not only in the burdens\nand standard of proof but also in the identity of the fact-finder that\nmight be an administrator, a judge or a jury (with varying decision\nrules from majority to unanimity). Finally, the size and nature of\nboth the formal and informal sanction may vary. The policymaker sets\nthe formal sanction but the informal sanction arises from the informal\nsocial response to violation of the norm. Violating a criminal law\ntypically provokes more severe social sanctions than violating an\nadministrative regulation or a norm enforced only through private\ncivil actions.\n\nThese institutional variations suggest that the rational policymaker\nwill determine that different forms, even if they impose identical\nsanctions, will create different expected penalties for violating the\nnorm and give rise to different distributions of type 1 and type 2\nerrors, where a type 1 error incorrectly rejects plaintiff\u2019s\nclaim and a type 2 error incorrectly accepts it. The different legal\nforms will thus create different incentives and induce different\nbehaviors, even when imposed sanctions are identical. Moreover, the\npolicymaker might in fact choose among these forms on the basis of\nthese different incentives and on the relative importance of Type 1\nand Type 2 errors.\n\nThe elaborate differences among these legal forms thus make it\ndifficult to isolate a distinctive account of legal normativity. The\nsubtle variations in form have consequences for behavior on the\neconomic account that might explain variations in responses to the\nvarious legal forms that we might have initially attribute to\nnormativity.\n4.3 Strategies of Accommodation\n\nAs the last subsection noted, prudence can explain differences in\nbehavior that result from the different legal forms. Each form creates\na different expected sanction and an economically rational actor will\nrespond differently to these different expected sanctions. Moreover,\nany differences in expected behavior might be attributable to\ndifferences in the policymaker\u2019s objective function. Different\nburdens of proof generate different distributions of error types. A\npolicymaker might tolerate more deviant behavior to ensure that\ninnocent people do not suffer\n penalties.[18]\n\nNevertheless, one might intuitively expect greater compliance to\nemissions standards regulated through a criminal penalty than to\nemissions standards regulated by a tax, even if the expected payment\nfor each available action were identical under the two regimes. This\nintuition runs counter to the rational choice explanation. Only if\nthis intuition is correct could we say that the law provides\nnon-prudential reasons for action. \n\nThe economic model of behavior, however, is extremely flexible. It\nrequires careful consideration to conclude that the model cannot\naccommodate \u201cnormativity.\u201d This section assesses the\ntechniques available to the economic model of behavior to determine\nthe extent to which ideas of normativity may be accommodated.\n\nFrom the philosophical literature on obligation and the very limited\neconomic literature on obligatory behavior, one may extract four\npossible mechanisms through which obligation influences individual\naction. The first mechanism simply reduces obligations to the standard\nmodel of (narrowly) self-interested rationality. The discussion of\nlegal form above suggested how this reduction might proceed. Further\nmethods of reduction are discussed below. \n\nSecond, one might weaken the assumption of full rationality. Boundedly\nrational agents may have reason to follow rules and these rules,\nthough perhaps best treated as rules of thumb, might cause the agent\nto mimic normative behavior. \n\nThe third mechanism identifies preference as the pathway through which\nobligation operates; obligations motivate when they are\n\u201cinternalized.\u201d Internalization may take at least two\ndifferent forms. One form dissolves the normativity of law while the\nother has an ad hoc quality. \n\nFinally, obligation may influence the agent\u2019s deliberative or\ndecision process. One might understand this mechanism as treating the\nagent\u2019s preferences as context-dependent; how she ranks\nalternatives depends on whether (and which) obligations apply. I\nconsider each of these mechanisms in turn.\n4.3.1 Reduction\n\nEconomic analysis of law easily accommodates sanction theories of\nduty. The analyst here simply reduces the sanction theory to\nself-interested preference maximization. This approach, as noted\nabove, adheres to the assumption that agents are (narrowly)\nself-interested. It recognizes, however, that a legal rule may either\nprovide the agent with relevant information (and hence change her\nbeliefs) or place a price on certain actions. The price a legal rule\nplaces on conduct will depend on the legal form as the legal form\ndetermines the monitoring mechanism and the burdens of proof, both of\nwhich determine the probability that the legal sanction will be\nimposed. \n\nIt is also straightforward to see how a legal rule might provide\ninformation that alters the agent\u2019s beliefs about the likely\noutcome of various courses of action. Consider, for example, a driver\non a mountain road who encounters a sign that indicates an impending\ncurve on which the speed limit has been lowered to 15 miles per hour.\nIn light of this sign, the agent should adjust her beliefs about the\nhighest safe speed at which she can negotiate the road. Regulations of\nhealth and safety may operate in a similar way. \n\nA third way that obligation might be reduced to self-interest relies\non repeated interaction. Agents with foresight understand that\nbehavior that deviates from the legal norm today may have consequences\nfor their subsequent dealings in the future. This harm arises even\nwhen the legal sanction is not imposed. The threat of future harm thus\nmay induce compliance with a legal norm even in the absence of\nsanction. \n\nFinally, in many instances, rational agents need to coordinate their\nactions. In coordination games, for example, each agent ranks the\ndifferent possible outcomes identically; but, when multiple equilibria\nexist, the agents may fail to coordinate on a desirable equilibrium. A\nlegal rule may publicly announce an equilibrium to play and that\nannouncement may coordinate the agents\u2019 actions. \n\nAnnouncement of a legal rule in this context can coordinate the\nplayers\u2019 actions. It gives each agent a reason to choose as the\nrule dictates if it affects the individual\u2019s beliefs concerning\nwhich strategy the other agents will adopt. On this account, the\nsocial fact that individuals accept the law provides each individual\nwith a reason to act. This reason is independent of any sanction that\nthe law might impose for non-compliance. Moreover this reason is\nprudential in that it best promotes the agent\u2019s own welfare. Of\ncourse, one might say that the reason is also moral as it best\npromotes the well-being of all. This coincidence between the moral and\nprudential results from the coincidence of interests of all agents.\n\n4.3.2 Bounded Rationality\n\nA second route to the accommodation of normativity within the economic\nmodel acknowledges that individuals are boundedly rational. The\nassumption of bounded rationality admits the possibility that agents\nshould follow rules. A legal rule would then be justified, in a manner\nconsistent with Raz\u2019s [1979, 1986] account of authority, when\nadherence to the rule improved the decision making of the agent.\n\nIn the simplest model in which such an account exists, agents face a\ncost of deliberation. The more complex the deliberative calculation,\nthe higher the costs the agent incurs. When the marginal cost of\ndeliberation is sufficiently high, the agent might do better to follow\na rule that quickly, and therefore cheaply, identifies a good but not\noptimal\n action.[19]\n If the expected benefit from choosing the optimal action (relative to\nthe good action) is less than the cost, it is prudent for the agent to\nadopt the rule of thumb. More sophisticated accounts of an economic\nrationale for rule-following rely on more complex models of bounded\nrationality. \n\nTo complete an economic account of the authority of law requires that\none explain why the agent should consider legal rules as the relevant\nrules to which she should defer. One might argue that those who\npromulgate legal rules have special expertise that makes it likely\nthat they will enact rules that are better than the rules that the\nagent herself would formulate. For some legal rules\u2014technical\nrules concerning health and safety promulgated by administrative\nagencies\u2014the argument may have merit. After all the decision at\nissue depends on a mass of technical data that is not easily\nassimilable or manipulable. For many other legal rules promulgated by\nlegislatures and courts, however, the argument may not apply.\n\nSeveral other features of this argument merit attention. First, it\nparallels the argument for authority offered by Joseph\n Raz.[20]\n As in Raz\u2019s argument, authority is specific to legal rules\nrather than to law in general. An agent might believe the law more\nexpert than she with respect to some decisions but not with respect to\nother decisions. In fact, agents with different expertise themselves\nwould find different legal rules authoritative.\n\nSecond, on this account of authority, the legal rule affects the\nagent\u2019s deliberation not because of the sanction for\nnon-compliance but because compliance with the legal rule, even in the\nabsence of a sanction, is in the agent\u2019s best interest. This\nfeature of the account of authority conforms to notions, developed\nfurther below, of the way in which rules enter the deliberative\nprocess. But this feature also limits the applicability of the account\nto those legal rules that bear on the agent\u2019s immediate\ninterest. Many legal rules direct the agent to adopt actions that\nraise her own costs; in the absence of a sanction for non-compliance,\nher own interest would dictate non-compliance. For example, a rule\nrequiring that an agent adopt due care in certain activities may raise\nthe agent\u2019s\n costs.[21]\n\nThe prudential account of authority outlined above primarily addresses\nprivate individuals. One might ask the parallel question concerning\nthe obligation to obey the law of public officials. In some respects,\nthis question has greater significance than the question concerning\nprivate individuals because many acknowledge that the motivation of\nprivate individuals to obey the law is usually prudential, the desire\nto avoid sanctions. Moreover, on some jurisprudential accounts, most\nnotably the legal positivism of H. L. A. Hart, the attitudes and\nbehavior of public officials determine the existence and nature of\nlaw.\n\nThe economic account of authority, however, does not provide a\ncompelling explanation of official behavior. Consider how the economic\naccount applies to public officials. The relevant obligations here are\nthe official obligations of the individual: the judicial obligation to\ndecide cases according to the dictates of stare decisis and\nother obligatory practices; or the executive official\u2019s\nobligation to apply the law. Two difficulties arise immediately. How\nis compliance with these official obligations in the\nindividual\u2019s interest? Why must the agent follow a rule rather\nthan optimize in each instance? This second difficulty is less\ntroublesome than the first; Ronald Heiner [1986], for example, has\noffered a prudential account, grounded in bounded rationality, of the\njudicial obligation to adhere to stare\n decisis.[22]\n\n\nOne might attempt to resolve the first difficulty concerning the\nagent\u2019s interest by arguing that compliance with official\nobligation is in the individual\u2019s interest because she desires\nto maintain her employment. But this explanation rests on an incentive\nargument. The sanction of dismissal induces the compliance rather than\nnormative motivation to comply with one\u2019s obligation; it is\nanother prudential account. The prudential account of authority thus\nfails to overcome this first difficulty. It is not clear then that the\nprudential account of authority can ground the normativity of law.\n4.3.3 Obligation within Preference\n\nEconomic theorists offer a highly abstract account of individual\ndecision-making. Its abstract nature renders the theory remarkably\nflexible. As it is an account of instrumental rationality, it can\naccommodate many different substantive accounts that differ in their\nspecification of what ends are rational or, more simply, whatever ends\nthe agent happens to have. \n\nBriefly, the economic explanation of decisions states simply that the\nagent chooses the feasible option that she ranks most highly according\nto her \u201cpreferences.\u201d \u201cPreference\u201d is a\ntechnical term, not a psychological concept. By definition, a\npreference is a linear order over some domain of objects. A linear\norder is complete, asymmetric, and transitive. Less formally, we may\nunderstand preference as a relation \u201cat least as preferred\nas\u201d over the relevant domain. Completeness requires that, for\nany two objects a, b, either a is at least as\npreferred as b or b is at least as preferred as\na. Asymmetry states that if a is at least as preferred\nas b and b is at least as preferred as a then\na is indifferent to b. Finally transitivity requires\nthat if a is at least as preferred as b and b is\nat least as preferred as c then a is at least as\npreferred as c. \n\nAn agent typically has a number of competing ends. One can interpret\nthe agent\u2019s preferences as her all-things-considered ranking of\nall possible outcomes. One might then consider the obligations under\nwhich the agent finds herself as among the agent\u2019s competing\n\u201cends\u201d. The question of compatibility between economic\nrationality as preference and obligation then reduces to the question\nof whether obligations may be integrated with the other concerns of\nthe agent into an all-things-considered ranking that satisfies the\npreference axioms.\n\nIntegrability presents a serious challenge to the economic account of\nrationality. Nevertheless, the theory has substantial resources to\nmeet this challenge. To illustrate, consider Neumann\u2019s [2007]\nanalysis of the famous example used by Anand [1993] and Sen [1993]. In\nthis example, they consider an agent whom we shall call Freddie.\nFreddie is Liza\u2019s guest for dinner and he has been offered a\nplate with three slices of cake on it. One slice is small, one medium,\nand one large. Freddie has two concerns: he wants the largest piece of\ncake available and he wants to conform to the social norm \u201cnever\ntake the largest piece\u201d. In Sen\u2019s and Anand\u2019s\naccount, Freddie cannot integrate these two concerns into a preference\nbecause his choices violate a condition of contraction consistency\nwhich is necessary for transitivity. That is, from the pair (small\nslice, medium slice), Freddie chooses the small slice but from the\ntriple (small slice, medium slice, large slice), Freddie chooses the\nmedium slice. These choices, however, are inconsistent only under the\ndescription given. \n\nSen and Anand use the absolute size of the pieces of cake to describe\nFreddie\u2019s options. As Neumann points out, this description\nignores a decision relevant aspect of Freddie\u2019s choice\nsituation; Freddie cares about the relative size of the pieces\nof cake. Freddie\u2019s choices under a description using relative\nsizes conform to the axioms defining a preference.\n\nWill appropriate redescription resolve all conflicts between\n\u201cpreference\u201d and \u201cobligation\u201d? A related\napproach to this problem suggests that the answer to this question\ndepends on the structure of the norm. Baigent [2007] and Xu [2007]\nconsider the rationalizability of choice when the agent faces\nnormative constraints. In these situations, the agent, facing a set of\nfeasible options, first eliminates those acts that are normatively\nprohibited. He then chooses the best available option from this\nrestricted set of feasible options. Whether we can attribute an\nall-things-considered preference to the agent depends on the structure\nof the obligation and the detail of the agent\u2019s preferences.\n\n4.3.4 Deliberation.\n\nRationality in economics is instrumental; the agent\u2019s ranking is\ntaken as given and as fundamental. The agent does not deliberate about\nher\n ends.[23]\n Accounts of practical reason, however, often involve deliberation\nover ends. The economic account of rationality may have less success\nin accommodating these accounts of obligation.\n\nRaz [1975] provides an account of practical reasoning in which\nobligation plays a central role. On this account, obligations are\nexclusionary reasons that provide the agent with both a first-order\nreason to take the obligatory act and a second-order reason not to\nconsider some set of first-order reasons actions. This structure\ndifferentiates obligations (or prohibitions) from taxes (or\npermissions).\n\nA simple example illustrates this logic. Consider a prohibition on\nemitting more than 75 parts per billion of sulfur dioxide per hour\ninto the air. This prohibition gives a power-generating plant reason\nnot to emit more than that amount of sulfur dioxide per hour. But it\nalso excludes a variety of other first-order reasons for action from\nthe plant\u2019s consideration. On Raz\u2019s account, the firm\nshould not act on, for instance, the fact that emitting more than 75\nparts per billion of sulfur dioxide per hour would increase its\nprofits (or lower its costs). The obligation would not, presumably,\nexclude reasons that arose from a situation in which a temporary\nfailure to exceed the emissions standard posed a substantial threat to\nthe health and safety of employees. \n\nA tax on sulfur dioxide emissions above 75 parts per billion per hour,\nby contrast, provides the firm with only a first-order reason for\naction. The firm regards the rate of taxation as a price on such\nemissions and can weigh that price against its other costs and\nbenefits. On this account, then, a tax and a fine that create\nidentical expected sanctions and the same distribution of type 1 and\ntype 2 errors should induce different behaviors. The fine will never\nlead to higher emission rates and, under some circumstances, should\ninduce lower emission rates. \n\nCan the economic theory of rationality accommodate this understanding\nof normativity? Arguably, the ad hoc assumption that the\nagent incurs a cost when she fails to comply with a legal duty\ncaptures this idea. This ad hoc cost implies that ordinary\ncosts and benefits must be sufficiently large to outweigh the cost\nimposed by the prohibition. But this approach fails to capture some of\nthe potential subtleties of an exclusionary reason as the obligation\nmay not depend on the size of the costs (or force of the reason) but\non the nature of it. An obligation may exclude some types of costs, no\nmatter how large, but not exclude other types of costs, no matter how\nsmall. \n\nAlternatively, one might understand the agent\u2019s preferences as\ncontext-dependent. The agent\u2019s ranking of alternatives depends\non which set of obligations apply to her. In each situation, she faces\na different set of reasons for action and she must adjust her ranking\nof her options to reflect these different reasons.\n5. Theories of Adjudication\n\nAdjudication plays a central role in legal institutions and in legal\nphilosophy. This centrality extends beyond the articulation of\ntheories of adjudication. Debates about the concept of law, for\ninstance, generally highlight the role of the judge. For Hart, judges\nare an important subset of those public officials whose social\nacceptance of a rule of recognition constitutes the community\u2019s\nlegal system. For Dworkin, the theory of adjudication itself\ndetermines the content of the law. \n\nEach strand of economic analysis of law has, at least implicitly,\narticulated a theory of adjudication. Doctrinal Analysis as a theory\nof adjudication was discussed in section 2.2. In this section, I\nconsider the theory of adjudication implicit in each of the other two\nstrands of economic analysis of law. \n\nEach theory occurs at the level at which the strand finds the law\ninstrumental. Policy analysis offers a normative theory of\nadjudication that addresses the judge; it specifies that she should\ndecide cases to maximize social welfare. Constitutional political\neconomy, by contrast, offers a normative theory of court structure. It\nspecifies the design of adjudicatory structures within which judges\nwill, of necessity, act in a self-interested fashion. We briefly\ndiscuss each theory in the following subsections. \n5.1 Adjudication in Political Economy\n\nAs noted earlier, the political economy strand of economic analysis of\nlaw itself contains two strands that are in tension with each other.\nOn the one hand, the radical political economy strand seeks only to\nexplain legal phenomena rather than to prescribe either the structure\nof legal institutions or the content of particular legal rules. One\nmight find within this strand of political economy a positive theory\nof adjudication but not a normative theory. Indeed, the positive\ntheory advanced argues that judges seek to promote their interests.\nUsually, these interests are defined as policy interests, that is, an\ninterest to promote particular policies.\n\nThe second strand of political economy, constitutional political\neconomy, does have normative aims. It assumes that political\nactors will act in a self-interested fashion within existing\npolitical institutions but that agents will act more impartially in\nthe design of the political institutions within which they\nwill\n work.[24]\n A normative theory of adjudication does emerge from this strand of\npolitical economy, but it differs significantly from the normative\ntheory endorsed by the policy analysis strand of economic analysis of\nlaw. For constitutional political economy, a normative theory of\nadjudication must be a structural one; it should describe the\nstructure of adjudication. The theory thus cannot dictate directly\njudicial motivation because, according to political economy, judges\nwill always act self-interestedly. Adjudicative institutions, however,\ncan be designed to align better the interests of judges with the\ninterests of the designer of the constitution.\n\nIn 1975, Landes and Posner offered a justification for the\nindependence of the judiciary that is often understood as a normative\ntheory of adjudication within the tradition of constitutional\npolitical economy. On the account of Landes and Posner, an independent\njudiciary serves the interest of legislators who seek to impose their\npolicies on the jurisdiction for periods that exceed the length of\ntheir majority in the legislature. As a consequence, they find it in\ntheir interest to have the judiciary enforce the original bargain\nstruck in all legislation.\n\nThis argument contains a normative theory of statutory interpretation.\nJudges ought to enforce the bargains reached by the legislature that\nenacted the statute. On this account, a judge ignores the views of the\ncurrent legislative majority. She also eschews interpretation of the\nstatute in terms of her own policy preferences.\n\nOne should note that, from the perspective of constitutional political\neconomy, the argument of Landes and Posner is incomplete. They ground\ntheir theory of judicial independence in the interests of legislators.\nThe interests of legislators within extant legislative institutions\nmay not coincide with the interests of the constitutional\ndesigner.\n5.2 Adjudication in Policy Analysis\n\nThe normative theory of adjudication implicit in both policy analysis\nand doctrinal analysis follows from Posner\u2019s early claim that\nthe common law ought to be efficient. The theories are essentially\nidentical. The two projects differ only in the seriousness with which\nthey take actual behavior. Policy analysis rests on the behavioral\nclaim and hence must look to the actual behavior induced by legal\nrules, while doctrinal analysis often seems to rely only on\n\u201cefficiency\u201d within some specified model.\n\nA normative theory of adjudication was among the earliest claims\nadvanced in the economic analysis of law. Posner [1973, 1979, 1980,\n1985, 1990, 1995] asserted claim VI in the introduction: the common\nlaw ought to be efficient. He interpreted efficiency as\n\u201cwealth maximization\u201d but then interpreted wealth\nmaximization as \u201cwillingness to pay.\u201d This interpretive\nstance yielded an argument that judges in (common law) cases ought to\nchoose the legal rule that maximized the ratio of benefits to costs as\nmeasured by the sum of individual willingnesses to pay.\n\nPosner\u2019s claim evoked great controversy in the late 1970s and\nearly 1980s. (See, e.g., Symposium [1980].) Twenty years\nlater, Kaplow and Shavell [2001] revived and revised Posner\u2019s\nclaim. The revision had two components. First, and most importantly,\nthey chose welfarism generally rather than cost-benefit\nanalysis in particular as the normative basis for adjudication.\nWelfarism requires that evaluation depend solely on the well-being of\nindividuals. Cost-benefit analysis is thus a form of welfarist\nevaluation; but Kaplow and Shavell\u2019s argument allows them to\navoid various criticisms of cost-benefit analysis. Second, Kaplow and\nShavell do not argue primarily for a normative theory of adjudication.\nRather, they contend that evaluation of legal rules and institutions\nby scholars ought to be welfarist. They suggest, however, that judges\nby and large have the same evaluative obligation as the third-party\nanalyst.\n5.2.1 A brief critique of cost-benefit analysis as a theory of adjudication\n\nCost-benefit analysis attempts to implement a Kaldor-Hicks evaluative\ncriterion. According to the Kaldor-Hicks criterion, a distribution of\ngoods (broadly understood) X is superior to a distribution of\ngoods Y if and only if there exists a third distribution of\ngoods Z such that (a) Z is a redistribution of the\ndistribution X; and (b) Z is Pareto preferred to\n Y.[25]\n\nCost-benefit analysis proceeds in two steps. First, for each\nindividual, it identifies a particular representation of the\nindividual\u2019s ordinal ranking of the options open to the policy\nmaker. Second, it aggregates these representations of each\nindividual\u2019s preferences into a social ranking.\n\nThe first step is unproblematic. Consider agent K. K\nhas preferences over states of the world. A representation of these\npreferences begins with a baseline policy and ranks all policies\nrelative to the baseline. Specifically, it assigns a number to each\nstate of the world such that K prefers state X to\nstate Y if and only if the number assigned to state\nX is higher than the number assigned to state Y.\nCost-benefit analysis defines states of the world as (policy, wealth)\npairs and defines the agent\u2019s willingness to pay for a move from\nstate X to Y as the change in wealth in state\nY that would the agent indifferent to the state X.\nThis procedure thus links the range of numbers that the agent may\nassign to the agent\u2019s wealth as willingness to pay is defined in\npart in terms of the agent\u2019s ability to\n pay.[26]\n The procedure for assigning numbers on the basis of an\nindividual\u2019s willingness to pay in fact yields a representation\nof that agent\u2019s preferences. Willingness to pay is a utility\nfunction that accurately represents the agent\u2019s (ordinal)\npreferences over states. Notice, however, that, if the agent chooses a\ndifferent baseline policy, the numbers, though ordered identically,\nwill not be the same as those derived from the original baseline. (One\nsees this immediately when one notes that the baseline policy always\nreceive a value 0.)\n\nThe second step of cost-benefit analysis is more problematic. To\naggregate the individual willingnesses to pay, cost-benefit analysis\nsimply sums the individual willingnesses to pay. One can see\nimmediately several difficulties with this procedure. First, each\nranking is ordinal; the numbers have no significance beyond the order.\nSuppose that, using the status quo Q as a baseline, K assigns\na number 2 to policy X, a number 4 to policy Y and a\nnumber 16 to policy Z while, when using policy P as a\nbaseline, she assigns a number 3 to policy X, a number 9 to\npolicy Y and a number 27 to policy Z. As the\nrepresentations are ordinal, one cannot conclude anything about\nK\u2019s intensity of preference; her Q-based representation\nof her preferences \u201cassesses\u201d the difference between\nZ and Y as six times the difference between\nY and X while her P-based representation of her\npreferences thinks the difference between Z and Y is\nonly three times the difference between Y and X. not\nprefer Z to Y. The choice of baseline may thus\naffect the choice of policy.\n\nSecond, cost-benefit analysis adopts a method of interpersonal\ncomparisons of well-being that is particularly unconvincing.\nInterpersonal comparison of well-being requires that one identify the\nappropriate representation of each individual\u2019s preference\nordering and compare those representations. Cost-benefit analysis,\nhowever, does not identify representations on moral or political\ngrounds; rather it chooses the representations that contingently arise\nfrom the actual distribution of wealth and income in the\n society.[27]\n If Tom is poor while Bill is wealthy, it is unclear why the\nrepresentations of the well-being of each that derives from\nwillingness to pay provide interpersonally comparable measures.\nEqually, if Tom and Bill are equally wealthy but Tom is disabled and\nBill is not, the willingness to pay of each may still not be\ninterpersonally comparable.\n5.2.2 A Structural Critique of Welfarist theories of adjudication.\n\nOne might construct a normative theory of adjudication at either of\ntwo levels. First, one might take as given the general structure of\nadjudication within a particular judicial system and ask what\nobligations the judges within that system ought to have. Second, one\nmight more fundamentally design the judicial system from scratch. On\nthis second account, the institutional environment in which judges act\nas well as the obligations of judges within that institutional\nenvironment would be subject to evaluation.\n\nMost normative theories of adjudication are of the first type. They\ntake the institutional structure in which adjudication occurs largely\nas given and then identify the obligations of judges within that\nsystem. Phrased differently, normative theories of adjudication are\ninterpretive of an ongoing practice rather than efforts to design a\npractice from scratch. Welfarist theories of adjudication face several\ndifficulties when understood as interpretive theories of existing\n(common law)\n practice.[28]\n\nFirst, the structure of adjudication does not generally provide\nadequate or appropriate information for the selection of rules that\nmaximize social welfare. Adjudication in a common law system usually\nfocuses on a past transaction between particular parties. This\ntransaction may not be typical of transactions that were litigated; it\ncertainly will not be typical of the entire population of transactions\nthat a rule would govern. Under a given rule, for instance, the set of\ntransactions that do not lead to litigation are likely to differ\nsystematically from the set of transactions that do give rise to\nlitigation. Equally important, different legal rules are apt to\ngenerate different sets of transactions. The current structure of\nadjudication does not provide any information that would help a\ndecision maker assess these differences across potential legal\nrules.\n\nSecond, the selection procedure for judges does not identify\nindividuals with the appropriate training and background to make\naccurate calculations of social welfare. Judges in common law\ncountries have generally not been trained systematically in economics\nand statistics, two disciplines necessary (but not sufficient) for the\ndetermination of social welfare under alternative legal rules.\n\nThird, and related, judges usually face severe constraints in the set\nof legal rules they may consider in any adjudication. When confronted\nby a tort case, for example, the court usually considers a limited\nnumber of legal regimes; perhaps it will reformulate the standard of\ncare or shift from a regime of negligence to one of strict liability.\nA court, however, is unlikely to adopt a complex scheme of no-fault\ninsurance or to impose a different insurance scheme, even though these\nmore radical transformations of social institutions would provide\nhigher overall welfare.\n6. Evaluation of Legal Rules and Institutions\n\nThe evaluative tradition in economics is resolutely welfarist. That\ntradition extends to the policy analysis branch of economic analysis\nof law. In the prior section, we considered the manifestation of this\ntradition in the advocacy of cost-benefit analysis as a normative\ntheory of adjudication. In this section, we consider arguments for\nwelfarism as the sole evaluative standard against which to appraise\nlegal rules and institutions. \n\nThe critique of cost-benefit analysis described in section 5.2.1 was\ndirected against cost-benefit analysis, a specific and concrete form\nof welfarism developed to implement the more abstract evaluative ideas\nunderlying welfarism. Objections to this specific instantiation of\nwelfarism do not necessarily run against the more general class of\nevaluative criteria. Similarly, the critique described in section\n5.2.2 focused on the institutional structure of adjudication; though\nthis structure may be hostile to an implementation of a welfarist\ntheory of adjudication, it has no bearing on the appropriate criteria\nagainst which a third party should assess legal rules and\ninstitutions. \n\nThe discussion in this section reviews the debate over whether the\nevaluation of legal rules and institutions should rely only\non welfarist criteria. As noted earlier, Kaplow and Shavell [2001]\noffered an extensive argument for welfarism as the sole criterion.\nTheir argument has several\n elements.[29]\n The first element identifies an individual\u2019s well-being with\nher preferences. Thus, an individual K has greater well-being\nin state X than in state Y, if and only if she\nprefers state X to state Y. In the second, key\nelement of the argument, welfarism interprets the agent\u2019s\npreferences as her all-things-considered ranking of alternatives. This\nstep thus incorporates within the agent\u2019s preference ordering\nanything that the agent considers relevant to her decisions.\nConsequently, the claim about an agent\u2019s well-being now becomes:\nK prefers state X to state Y if and only if\nK believes, all things considered, that state X is\nbetter than (or ought to be promoted rather than) state B.\n\n\nK\u2019s all-things-considered judgments, of course, will\nincluded many considerations that, in ordinary language, are not\nusually considered as in K\u2019s self-interest or even as\ncontributing to her well-being. So, for example, her\nall-things-considered judgments will incorporate concerns for the\nwell-being of others as well as considerations of justice and\ndeontological constraints on action. Section 6.1 discusses the\ncounterargument that an individual\u2019s concerns for justice and\nher endorsement of deontological constraints cannot be integrated into\nan adequate concept of well-being.\n\nKaplow and Shavell\u2019s argument for the exclusivity of welfarism\nas an evaluative criterion rests on a third leg. The argument contends\nthat use of any non-welfarist criterion is incompatible with the\nPareto criterion. Section 6.2 accepts this claim for purposes of\nargument. The discussion then points out that the Pareto criterion\nconflicts with principles of rationality, valuation, liberty, and\nresponsibility that have an equally strong\n appeal.[30]\n It is thus not clear that we should accept the Pareto criterion and\nreject these others principles.\n6.1 Preference and Well-being\n\nCall an ordering that incorporates every consideration that the agent\nviews as relevant to her decision \u201can extended preference\nordering\u201d. Kaplow and Shavell include the agent\u2019s moral\nconcerns in this extended preference ordering. We may call this\napproach the \u201cstrategy of incorporation.\u201d \n\nA complete argument that the extended preference ordering does not\ncorrespond to a morally compelling conception of well-being would\nrequire articulation of the concept of well-being, a task well beyond\nthe scope of this entry. Here we outline two formal arguments against\nthe strategy of incorporation that treats the agent\u2019s moral\nconcerns, her views about equality, fairness, and distributive and\ncorrective justice more generally, as elements of well-being.\n\nWe broached the first formal argument in section 4. There we noted\nthat not every norm could be integrated with self-interested concerns\ninto an all-things-considered set of judgments that satisfied the\nformal conditions of a preference. To succeed, the strategy of\nincorporation must show that each of the agent\u2019s moral\n\u201ctastes\u201d or concerns have a normative structure that is\ncompatible with her underlying, self-interested preferences. The\nstrategy of incorporation thus might fail because of the structure of\nthe obligations that the agent endorses.\n\nSecond, a welfarist theory distinguishes between the well-being of\neach agent and the criteria that determine the structure of the social\nwelfare\n function.[31]\n The theory, that is, distinguishes what makes an individual\u2019s\nlife go better and the concerns that determine how one integrates the\nwell-being of individuals into \u201csocial welfare.\u201d These\nlatter concerns weigh the well-being of individual J against\nthe well-being of individual K. Consider two states of the\nworld s and t. Agent J\u2019s well-being is\nhigher in state s than in state t while agent\nK\u2019s well-being is higher in state t than in state\ns. To rank the two states, society must determine the relative\nimportance of the well-being of the two individuals. \n\nMoral norms perform precisely this function. A moral norm determines\nwhen the well-being of agent J should take precedence over the\nwell-being of agent K. Indeed, we say that agent J has a\nright against agent K precisely when we think that the\ndecisions or choices of agent J should prevail over the\ndecisions or choices of agent K. The moral concerns of each\nagent thus reflect the agent\u2019s views about the structure of the\nsocial choice function, not (necessarily) her views about what\nconstitutes her own well-being. \n\nOf course, an agent might believe that her life goes better if she\nlives in a more egalitarian society. But she might also believe to the\ncontrary that her life would go better if she lived in a more\nhierarchical society. Then, the social structure would affect the\nagent\u2019s well-being. The choice of social structure, however, is\nnot dependent on the agent\u2019s well-being. The structure of the\nsocial choice function rather determines the social structure. Thus,\nan agent may believe that an egalitarian social welfare function is\nappropriate (or perhaps even \u201cbetter than\u201d a hierarchical\nsocial welfare function, but she may nonetheless believe that her own\nwell-being would be higher in a hierarchical society than in an\negalitarian one. \n\nThe social welfare function resolves conflicts of\n\u201cinterest\u201d between individuals. Moral disagreements,\nhowever, reflect not conflicts of interest but a dispute over how such\nconflicts should be resolved. The resolution of a moral conflict\ndetermines whose well-being counts not how much well-being the agent\nhas. The strategy of incorporation confuses these two\n concepts.[32]\n\nMany of the concerns that, under the strategy of incorporation, are\nincluded in an individual\u2019s extended preference ordering thus\nbear on the structure of the social choice function; they do not\nnecessarily make the agent\u2019s life go better. Concerns for\ndistributive justice, for example, reflect moral judgments about how\nto integrate different distributions of well-being. They do not\nreflect judgments about how well-off each agent\n is.[33]\n Similarly, respect for deontological constraints on action reflect\nthe judgment that the effects on the well-being of the constrained\nagent do not bear on our assessment of the social state. \n\nThe social welfare function aggregates or integrates the well-being of\neach individual in society into a social ranking of states. It does\nnot integrate or aggregate the differing views of the individuals\nconcerning the appropriate social welfare function. Conflicts over the\nappropriate social welfare function must be resolved through some\nseparate process. Society for example might vote on which social\nwelfare function to adopt. Such a vote might be justified on epistemic\ngrounds; it cannot be justified on social welfare grounds. We do not\nchoose our social welfare function in order to maximize social\n welfare.[34]\n\n6.2 The Pareto Criterion\n\nLet us first define the Pareto criterion. Consider a society of n\nindividuals, each of whom has a well-defined preference over all\npossible states of the world. The Pareto criterion states that a state\nof the world x is socially better than a state of the world\ny if and only if each individual considers state x at\nleast as preferred as state y and at least one person strictly\nprefers x to y. It follows from this definition, of\ncourse, that, if each individual prefers x to y, then\nx is socially better than y. \n\nThe Pareto criterion has a strong intuitive appeal. If everyone agrees\nthat a state x is preferred to a state y, certainly the\ncollective assessment must rank x more highly than y.\nThe Pareto criterion moreover appears to be weak, i.e., to impose few\nconstraints on social choice. After all, each member of the society\nwill only rarely rank two alternatives as every other member of the\nsociety. Nevertheless, the Pareto criterion has strong implications\nfor the aggregation of individual judgments. Indeed, as summarized\nbelow, the Pareto criterion is inconsistent with a large number of\nother principles, each of which also has strong intuitive appeal. \n\nPerhaps the inconsistency that would most disconcert an economist\narises between the Pareto criterion and the demand for aggregate\nrationality under uncertainty. Consider again our society of n\nindividuals. Assume now, though, that society must choose among a\nnumber of policies, the consequences of which will depend on the\nunderlying but unknown state of the world. Each individual has\npreferences over these policies that satisfy the axioms of subjective\nexpected utility theory. Consequently, one may represent each\nindividual\u2019s preference over actions by a set of preferences\nover consequences and a set of beliefs (that satisfy the probability\naxioms) over states of the world; moreover, the individual prefers\npolicy p to policy q if and only if the expected utility\nfrom policy p exceeds the expected utility from policy\nq. \n\nAggregate rationality imposes two constraints on the construction of\ncollective preference over policies. First, it demands the\nconstruction of a collective preference over policies that also\nsatisfies the axioms of subjective expected utility theory. Second,it\ndemands that each the collective preference be responsive to the\npreferences of the members of the collective. This demand implies,\nwhen individual preferences satisfy the axioms of subjective expected\nutility theory, that each component of the representation of\ncollective preference be responsive to the corresponding component of\nthe representations. Both the collective utility function and the\ncollective beliefs must be responsive to the individual utilities (or\npreferences over outcomes) and the individual beliefs about the\nlikelihood of states of the world. \n\nSuppose, in addition, that we demand that the collective preference\nsatisfy the Pareto criterion. That is, if each individual in society\nprefers policy p to policy q, then society collectively\nmust prefer p to q. Unfortunately, Seidenfeld, Kadane,\nand Schervish [1989] have proven that, if at least two individuals\nboth rank two consequences differently and assess the likelihoods of\ntwo states of the world differently, then society cannot\nsimultaneously satisfy the Pareto criterion and the demands of\naggregate rationality.\n\nThe Pareto criterion also conflicts with substantive moral claims.\nLarry Temkin [1993], for example, has argued that the Pareto criterion\nis inconsistent with the existence of communal goods. A communal good\nis one that provides social value but does not improve the well-being\nof any individual. A communal good, that is, is good for us\neven though it is good for no individual. He offers equality\nas an example. A society with equality of well-being, for instance,\nmight be better than a society in which individuals have highly\nunequal levels of well-being even if each person in the unequal\nsociety has higher well-being than she has in the more equal society.\n\n\nCommunal goods often seem scarce or improbable; how could something\nthat is good for us together be good for none of us in particular?\nMany people, for example, reject either the claim that equality is a\ncommunal good or that it is valuable at all. Our prior discussion in\nsection 6.1, however, suggests a host of potential other communal\n\u201cgoods\u201d. There is a sense in which each of the\ndeterminants of the structure of the social welfare function is good\nfor us without necessarily being good for anyone. At least for a\nwelfarist, the structure of the social welfare function is\nconstitutive of the good. Everyone might be \u201cbetter off\u201d\nunder a regime of slavery but that regime would nevertheless remain\nworse than a free society.\n\nThe Pareto criterion is also inconsistent with three different aspects\nof the value of autonomy: liberty, responsibility, and\nself-governance. A formal argument underlies each of these claims.\nAmartya Sen [1971] first articulated the conflict between the Pareto\ncriterion and liberty. He began from the standard social choice\nframework developed by Arrow [1963] in which each agent has\npreferences over final states of the world. He imposed two of the\nArrovian conditions, universal domain and the Pareto criterion, but\nsubstituted the condition of minimal liberty for the other two\n(non-dictatorship and independence of irrelevant alternatives).\nMinimal liberty is indeed minimal; Sen required only that each member\nin society was decisive over two alternatives. He then proved that one\ncould not construct a social preference that satisfied all three\naxioms; the Pareto criterion and minimal liberty conflict.\n\nThe Arrovian framework, however, does not present the ideal\nenvironment in which to study minimal liberty. An agent may have the\nright (or in Hohfeldian terms a privilege) to determine a social\ndecision. Typically, though, he need not exercise his right. Or the\nagent may be willing to trade or waive his right in exchange for some\nbenefit. Gibbard [1974] argued that the power to waive one\u2019s\nrights undermined Sen\u2019s claim. Subsequent authors then\nreformulated Sen\u2019s argument within a more suitable, game\ntheoretic framework. See, e.g., Deb, Pattanaik and Razzolini [1997].\nThe conflict thus persists in a more plausible and appealing formal\nframework. \n\nIn Hohfeld\u2019s taxonomy of legal rights, a legal duty is the jural\ncorrelate of a legal right. We might similarly consider responsibility\nthe ethical correlate of liberty within the conceptual framework of\nautonomy. Recent formal work has shown that this aspect of autonomy\nalso conflicts with the Pareto criterion. \n\nSen defined autonomy as liberty understood as freedom to choose.\nAutonomy as responsibility for one\u2019s choices and actions\nrepresents the obverse side of this freedom to choose. Political\nphilosophers have examined this issue in their study of distributive\njustice. Rawls [1971] famously argued that individuals were not\nresponsible for their innate talents. Dworkin [1981] extended this\nargument through his distinction between \u201cbrute luck\u201d and\n\u201coption luck\u201d. Distributive justice in both arguments\nrequired insurance against bad realization of risks of \u201cbrute\nluck\u201d but responsibility for the bad realizations of option\nluck.\n\nWithin economics, the study of responsibility has emerged from the\nliterature initiated by Duncan Foley [1967] and Hal Varian [1974] on\nfairness. An allocation is fair if and only if it is Pareto efficient\nand envy-free. An allocation is envy-free if no individual would\nprefer the outcome assigned to another individual to the outcome\nassigned to her. In an exchange economy, a competitive equilibrium\nthat results from an initial, equal allocation of resources is both\nPareto efficient and envy-free because each individual has the same\nset of options available to her. The competitive equilibrium is thus\nfair. \n\nIn a production economy, however, a similar argument will fail if\nindividuals have different talents. The argument fails for two\nreasons. First, talents are not transferable though, of course, we may\ntransfer money between agents. Second, when two individuals have\nunequal talents, they face different sets of feasible options. The\nmore talented have better options and hence do better. The less\ntalented may envy them. As a consequence, no efficient and envy-free\nequilibrium exists. \n\nThese arguments apply to the more abstract concerns of distributive\njustice and responsibility. The no-envy test outlined above combines\ntwo distinct ideas. First, individuals with identical attributes for\nwhich they are responsible should have identical well-being. Second,\nindividuals with identical characteristics for which they are not\nresponsible should receive identical compensation for their losses.\nThe first condition addresses option luck; the second brute luck. \n\nFleurbaey [2008] comprehensively explores the tensions between these\ntwo aspects of the no-envy test and between the no-envy test and the\nPareto criterion. The compatibility of these two conditions depends on\nthe nature of the correlation of these effects of brute and option\nluck on the agent\u2019s well-being. If the well-being of agents with\nbad luck is unusually responsive to their bad luck, no fair allocation\nexists. The requirements of no-envy and the Pareto criterion again\nconflict. \n\nWe now turn to a third aspect of autonomy, self-governance. In the\ncontext of collective action, self-governance refers to democratic\ngovernance. The vast literature on social choice theory investigates\nthe relation of self-governance to the Pareto criterion in this\ncontext. \n\nVarious assumptions reflect the value of democratic governance in this\nliterature. The most minimal assumption is non-dictatorship. We may\ninterpret Arrow\u2019s initial result as demonstrating, for direct\ndemocracy, a complex incompatibility between the Pareto criterion and\nseveral other axioms including non-dictatorship, the axiom of minimal\nself-governance. The complexity arises because we cannot easily\ndetermine which of the several axioms is most fundamental. The\nliterature, for example, has investigated the importance of the axiom\nof independence of irrelevant alternatives more thoroughly than the\nPareto criterion. This emphasis perhaps reflects the strong appeal of\nthe Pareto criterion. \n\nRepresentative democracy, however, presents the conflict more starkly.\nIn modern society, communal self-governance generally operates through\nrepresentative institutions. Individuals do not directly enact\nsubstantive legislative programs. Rather, they elect representatives\nto legislatures that then enact substantive legislative programs.\nPhrased differently, election procedures are candidate-based rather\nthan assembly-based or program-based. Notice that this distinction\npersists even in those states that have adopted party-list\nproportional representation schemes. In these schemes, an individual\nvotes for a party rather than an individual candidate that has\nendorsed a specific program. The election determines the party\ncomposition of the legislature. Each contesting party then constitutes\na candidate. \n\nThese candidate-based procedures, however, are inconsistent with the\nminimal demands of communal self-governance. Benoit and Kornhauser\n[2010] have proven that the only Pareto efficient, candidate-based\nprocedure is a dictatorship. Again the Pareto criterion conflicts with\na (minimal) requirement of communal self-governance or autonomy.\n6.3 The Argument for Welfarism Revisited\n\nThe discussion in the previous section has not decisively demonstrated\nthat we should reject welfarism as the sole evaluative criterion for\nlegal rules and institutions. We have argued only that arguments that\nrest on the intuitive appeal of the Pareto criterion are insufficient\nto establish the welfarist claim. The Pareto criterion has great\nintuitive appeal but it also has strong implications that bring it\ninto conflict with other principles that also have strong intuitive\nappeal. \n\nLegal rules and institutions offer a comprehensive guide to and\nregulation of social life. The intuitive appeal of various principles\nmay vary with the range of activity governed by the legal rule or\ninstitution. The intuitive appeal of the Pareto criterion is strongest\nin those areas of law that regulate corporate and commercial behavior.\nPerhaps here, indeed, welfarist considerations should provide the sole\nguide to the structure of legal rules and institutions. Election law\nand laws regulating political speech, by contrast, may be legal\ndomains in which the appeal of principles of communal self-governance\ndominate. In these areas, evaluation based exclusively on welfarist\nconsiderations seems less appropriate. \n\nControversies in many areas of law, however, implicate many of our\nvalues. Environmental regulation, for example, clearly implicates\nwelfarist concerns. Regulation determines in part the relative costs\nof production of various goods and services that contribute to\nindividual well-being. Environmental regulation, however, also clearly\nimplicates questions of autonomy. Productive activities may impose\nunwanted risks on individuals that limit the exercise of the\nindividual\u2019s autonomy. Tort law perhaps raises these issues more\nstarkly. \n\nSimilarly, we may understand conflicts over the appropriate tax and\nsocial welfare policy as raising questions not only of efficiency but\nalso of autonomy as responsibility. Exclusive focus on welfarist\nconcerns distorts these policy debates by ignoring fundamental issues\nthat divide us.\n7. Concluding Remarks\n\nThough the controversy over economic analysis of law has waned, its\nproject continues to disquiet many scholars who study legal phenomena.\nThe prior discussion identifies two distinct sources for that\ndisquiet.\n\nMany legal scholars object to the normative theory of adjudication\nadvanced by policy analysts. These scholars generally reject the\nwelfarism to which policy analysis is committed. The prior discussion\nsuggests, however, that a rejection of welfarism as a moral theory is\nneither necessary nor sufficient for the rejection of the normative\ntheory of adjudication advanced by policy analysts. Moreover, the core\ncommitments and achievements of economic analysis do not lie in the\nconstruction of a normative theory of adjudication. Rejection of the\neconomic theory of adjudication thus leaves the central elements of\npolicy analysis, political economy, and doctrinal analysis largely\nintact.\n\nThe methodology of economic analysis of law poses a more significant\nchallenge to traditional accounts of law. Economic analysis of law\nprovokes disquiet because the model of self-interested maximization of\npreferences apparently does not admit a concept of normativity but\nexplaining the normativity of law is a central pre-occupation of\nphilosophy of law. The logic of this commitment to self-interested\nmaximization of preferences would appear to lead to a denial of the\nneed for a distinct concept of law in the explanation and evaluation\nof social institutions. As section 4 suggested, this denial of\nnormativity may only be apparent as the methodological resources of\neconomic analysis of law allow for at least some accommodation for the\nincorporation of some normative reasons into the explanation of\nbehavior.\n\nEconomic analysis of law seeks primarily to explain how people behave\nin response to legal rules and institutions. This core project of\neconomic analysis of law complements traditional legal theory with its\nemphasis on the nature of law and its normative claims. Within\neconomic analysis of law, however, lies a more ambitious project that\nwould radically reconstruct the debate over the concept of law (as\nsketched above in section 3.3). It replaces the debate over the\nconcept of law with two related inquiries.\n\nThe first inquiry is explanatory. It requires a concept of governance\nthat facilitates our understanding of how societies resolve problems\nof adaptation, monitoring, application, and sanction. Governance\nregimes include purely coercive regimes as well as regimes with some\nnormative aspect to them. It regards the debate over which of these\nsystems should be called \u201clegal systems\u201d as fruitless and\nuninteresting. \n\nThe second inquiry is normative and treats the term \u201claw\u201d\nas an honorific or a term of commendation that we apply to some\ngovernance structures. The value of legality, of course, is neither\nclear nor uncontroversial. It requires much elaboration. However\nelaborated, this approach treats law as an achievement of governance,\nnot a mode of governance.\n\nThese two conceptual inquiries intersect. An analogy with economics\nmay clarify the intersection. Economics at its core studies resource\nallocation mechanisms. In so doing, economists have identified a\nparticular value, efficiency, that good resource allocation mechanisms\nachieve or manifest. Economists then seek to identify the conditions\nunder which specific resource allocation mechanisms, such as\ncompetitive markets, will realize efficiency. \n\nEconomic analysis of law suggests a similar research project. First,\ncharacterize governance structures. Next, specify the value of\nlegality. Finally, identify the conditions under which specific\ngovernance structures realize the value of legality.
