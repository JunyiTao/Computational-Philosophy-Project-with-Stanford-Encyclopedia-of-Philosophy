Even within Western legal traditions,\nthere are significant differences between Anglo-American law and\nContinental European law (see Dama\u0161ka 1973, 1975, 1992, 1994,\n1997). This entry focuses on the modern concept of evidence that\noperates in the legal tradition to which Anglo-American law\n belongs.[1]\n It concentrates on evidence in relation to the proof of factual\nclaims in\n law.[2]\n\nIt may seem obvious that there must be a legal concept of\nevidence that is distinguishable from the ordinary concept of\nevidence. After all, there are in law many special rules on what can\nor cannot be introduced as evidence in court, on how evidence is to be\npresented and the uses to which it may be put, on the strength or\nsufficiency of evidence needed to establish proof and so forth. But\nthe law remains silent on some crucial matters. In resolving the\nfactual disputes before the court, the jury or, at a bench trial, the\njudge has to rely on extra-legal principles. There have been academic\nattempts at systematic analysis of the operation of these principles\nin legal fact-finding (Wigmore 1937; Anderson, Schum, and Twining\n2009). These principles, so it is claimed, are of a general nature. On\nthe basis that the logic in \u201cdrawing inferences from evidence to\ntest hypotheses and justify conclusions\u201d is governed by the same\nprinciples across different disciplines (Twining and Hampsher-Monk\n2003: 4), ambitious projects have been undertaken to develop a\ncross-disciplinary framework for the analysis of evidence (Schum 1994)\nand to construct an interdisciplinary \u201cintegrated science of\nevidence\u201d (Dawid, Twining, and Vasilaki 2011; cf. Tillers\n2008).\n\nWhile evidential reasoning in law and in other contexts may share\ncertain characteristics, there nevertheless remain aspects of the\napproach to evidence and proof that are distinctive to law (Rescher\nand Joynt 1959). Section 1 (\u201cconceptions of evidence\u201d)\nidentifies different meanings of evidence in legal discourse. When\nlawyers talk about evidence, what is it that they are referring to?\nWhat is it that they have in mind? Section 2 (\u201cconditions for\nreceiving evidence\u201d) approaches the concept of legal evidence\nfrom the angle of what counts as evidence in law. What are the\nconditions that the law imposes and must be met for something to be\nreceived by the court as evidence? Section 3 (\u201cstrength of\nevidence\u201d) shifts the attention to the stage where the evidence\nhas already been received by the court. Here the focus is on how the\ncourt weighs the evidence in reaching the verdict. In this connection,\nthree properties of evidence will be discussed: probative value,\nsufficiency, and degree of completeness.\n", "toc": [{"#ConEviWhaDoeEviRefLaw": "1.

Conceptions of Evidence: What does Evidence Refer to in Law?\n\nStephen (1872: 3\u20134, 6\u20137) long ago noted that legal usage\nof the term \u201cevidence\u201d is ambiguous. It sometimes refers\nto that which is adduced by a party at the trial as a means of\nestablishing factual claims. (\u201cAdducing evidence\u201d is the\nlegal term for presenting or producing evidence in court for the\npurpose of establishing proof.) This meaning of evidence is reflected\nin the definitional section of the Indian Evidence Act (Stephen 1872:\n 149).[3]\n When lawyers use the term \u201cevidence\u201d in this way, they\nhave in mind what epistemologists would think of as \u201cobjects of\nsensory evidence\u201d (Haack 2004: 48). Evidence, in this sense, is\ndivided conventionally into three main\n categories:[4]\n oral evidence (the testimony given in court by witnesses),\ndocumentary evidence (documents produced for inspection by the court),\nand \u201creal evidence\u201d; the first two are self-explanatory\nand the third captures things other than documents such as a knife\nallegedly used in committing a crime.\n\nThe term \u201cevidence\u201d can, secondly, refer to a proposition\nof fact that is established by evidence in the first\n sense.[5]\n This is sometimes called an \u201cevidential fact\u201d. That the\naccused was at or about the scene of the crime at the relevant time is\nevidence in the second sense of his possible involvement in the crime.\nBut the accused\u2019s presence must be proved by producing evidence\nin the first sense. For instance, the prosecution may call a witness\nto appear before the court and get him to testify that he saw the\naccused in the vicinity of the crime at the relevant time. Success in\nproving the presence of the accused (the evidential fact) will depend\non the fact-finder\u2019s assessment of the veracity of the witness\nand the reliability of his testimony. (The fact-finder is the person\nor body responsible for ascertaining where the truth lies on disputed\nquestions of fact and in whom the power to decide on the verdict\nvests. The fact-finder is also called \u201ctrier of fact\u201d or\n\u201cjudge of fact\u201d. Fact-finding is the task of the jury or,\nfor certain types of cases and in countries without a jury system, the\njudge.) Sometimes the evidential fact is directly accessible to the\nfact-finder. If the alleged knife used in committing the crime in\nquestion (a form of \u201creal evidence\u201d) is produced in court,\nthe fact-finder can see for himself the shape of the knife; he does\nnot need to learn of it through the testimony of an intermediary.\n\nA third conception of evidence is an elaboration or extension of the\nsecond. On this conception, evidence is relational. A factual\nproposition (in Latin, factum probans) is evidence in the\nthird sense only if it can serve as a premise for drawing an inference\n(directly or indirectly) to a matter that is material to the case\n(factum probandum) (see\n section 2.2\n below for the concept of materiality). The fact that the\naccused\u2019s fingerprints were found in a room where something was\nstolen is evidence in the present sense because one can infer from\nthis that he was in the room, and his presence in the room is evidence\nof his possible involvement in the theft. On the other hand, the fact\nthat the accused\u2019s favorite color is blue would, in the absence\nof highly unusual circumstances, be rejected as evidence of his guilt:\nordinarily, what a person\u2019s favorite color happens to be cannot\nserve as a premise for any reasonable inference towards his commission\nof a crime and, as such, it is irrelevant (see discussion of relevance\nin\n section 2.1\n below). In the third sense of \u201cevidence\u201d, which conceives\nof evidence as a premise for a material inference, \u201cirrelevant\nevidence\u201d is an oxymoron: it is simply not evidence. Hence, this\nstatement of Bentham (1825:\n 230):[6]\n\n\nTo say that testimony is not pertinent, is to say that it is foreign\nto the case, has no connection with it, and does not serve to prove\nthe fact in question; in a word, it is to say, that it is not\nevidence.\n\n\nThere can be evidence in the first sense without evidence in the\nsecond or third sense. To pursue our illustration, suppose it emerges\nduring cross-examination of the expert that his testimony of having\nfound a finger-print match was a lie. Lawyers would describe this\nsituation as one where the \u201cevidence\u201d (the testimony of\nthe expert) fails to prove the fact that it was originally produced to\nprove and not that no \u201cevidence\u201d was adduced on the\nmatter. Here \u201cevidence\u201d is used in the first\nsense\u2014evidence as testimony\u2014and the testimony remains in\nthe court\u2019s record whether it is believed or not. But lawyers\nwould also say that, in the circumstances, there is no\n\u201cevidence\u201d that the accused was in the room, assuming that\nthere was nothing apart from the discredited expert testimony of a\nfingerprint match to establish his presence there. Here, the\nexpert\u2019s testimony is shown to be false and fails to establish\nthat the accused\u2019s fingerprints were found in the room, and\nthere is no (other) factual basis for believing that he was in the\nroom. The factual premise from which an inference is sought to be\ndrawn towards the accused\u2019s guilt is not established.\n\nFourthly, the conditions for something to be received (or, in\ntechnical term \u201cadmitted\u201d) as evidence at the trial are\nsometimes included in the legal concept of evidence. (These conditions\nare discussed in\n section 2\n below.) On this conception, legal evidence is that which counts as\nevidence in law. Something may ordinarily be treated as evidence and\nyet be rejected by the court. Hearsay is often cited as an example. It\nis pointed out that reliance on hearsay is a commonplace in ordinary\nlife. We frequently rely on hearsay in forming our factual beliefs. In\ncontrast, \u201chearsay is not evidence\u201d in legal proceedings\n(Stephen 1872: 4\u20135). As a general rule, the court will not rely\non hearsay as a premise for an inference towards the truth of what is\nasserted. It will not allow a witness to testify in court that another\nperson X (who is not brought before the court) said that\np on a certain occasion (an out-of-court statement) for the\npurpose of proving that p.\n\nIn summary, at least four possible conceptions of legal evidence are\nin currency: as an object of sensory evidence, as a proposition of\nfact, as an inferential premise and as that which counts as evidence\nin law. The sense in which the term \u201cevidence\u201d is being\nused is seldom made explicit in legal discourse although the intended\nmeaning will often be clear from the context.\n2. Conditions for Receiving Evidence: What Counts as Evidence in Law?\n\nThis section picks up on the fourth conception of evidence. To recall,\nsomething will be accepted by the court as evidence\u2014it is, to\nuse Montrose\u2019s term, receivable as evidence in legal\nproceedings\u2014only if three basic conditions are satisfied:\nrelevance, materiality, and admissibility\n(Montrose 1954). These three conditions of receivability are discussed\nin turn below.\n2.1 Relevance\n2.1.1 Legal Significance of Relevance\n\nThe concept of relevance plays a pivotal role in legal fact-finding.\nThayer (1898: 266, 530) articulates its significance in terms of two\nfoundational principles of the law of evidence: first, without\nexception, nothing which is not relevant may be received as evidence\nby the court and secondly, subject to many exceptions and\nqualifications, whatever is relevant is receivable as evidence by the\ncourt. Thayer\u2019s view has been influential and finds expression\nin sources of law, for example, in Rule 402 of the Federal Rules of\nEvidence in the United\n States.[7]\n Thayer claims, and it is now widely accepted, that relevance is a\n\u201clogical\u201d and not a legal concept; in\n section 2.1.3,\n we will examine this claim and the dissent expressed by Wigmore.\nLeaving aside the dissenting view for the moment, we will turn first\nto consider possible conceptions of relevance in the conventional\nsense of logical relevance.\n2.1.2 Conceptions of Logical Relevance\n\nEvidence may be adduced in legal proceedings to prove a fact only if\nthe fact is relevant. Relevance is a relational concept. No fact is\nrelevant in itself; it is relevant only in relation to another fact.\nThe term \u201cprobable\u201d is often used to describe this\nrelation. We see two instances of this in the following well-known\ndefinitions. According to Stephen (1886: 2, emphasis added):\n\n\nThe word \u201crelevant\u201d means that any two facts to which it\nis applied are so related to each other that according to the common\ncourse of events one either taken by itself or in connection with\nother facts proves or renders probable the past, present, or\nfuture existence or non-existence of the other.\n\n\nThe second definition is contained in the United States\u2019 Federal\nRule of Evidence 401 which (in its restyled version) states that\nevidence is relevant if \u201cit has a tendency to make a fact more\nor less probable than it would be without the evidence\u201d\n(emphasis added). The word \u201cprobable\u201d in these and other\nstandard definitions is sometimes construed as carrying the\nmathematical meaning of\n probability.[8]\n In a leading article, Lempert gave this example to show how relevance\nturns on the likelihood ratio. The prosecution produces evidence that\nthe perpetrator\u2019s blood found at the scene of the crime is type\nA. The accused has the same blood type. Suppose fifty percent of the\nsuspect population has type A blood. If the accused is in fact guilty,\nthe probability that the blood found at the scene will be type A is\n1.0. But if he is in fact innocent, the probability of finding type A\nblood at the scene is 0.5\u2014that is, it matches the background\nprobability of type A blood from the suspect population. The\nlikelihood ratio is the ratio of the first probability to the\nsecond\u20141.0:0.5 or, more simply, 2:1. Evidence is considered\nrelevant so long as the likelihood ratio is other than 1:1 (Lempert\n1977). If the ratio is 1:1, that means that the probability of the\nevidence is the same whether the accused is guilty or innocent.\n\nThe conventional view is that relevance in law is a binary concept:\nevidence is either relevant or it is not. So long as the likelihood\nratio is other than 1:1, the evidence is considered\n relevant.[9]\n However, the greater the likelihood ratio deviates from 1:1, the\nhigher the so-called probative value of the evidence (that is, on one\ninterpretation of probative value). We will take a closer look at\nprobative value in\n section 3.1\n below.\n\nWhile the likelihood ratio may be useful as a heuristic device in\nanalysing evidential reasoning, it is controversial as to whether it\ncaptures correctly the concept of relevance. In the first place, it is\nunclear that the term \u201cprobable\u201d in the standard\ndefinitions of relevance was ever intended as a reference to\nmathematical probability. Some have argued that relevance should be\nunderstood broadly such that any evidence would count as relevant so\nlong as it provides some reason in support of the conclusion that a\nproposition of fact material to the case is true or false (Pardo 2013:\n576\u2013577).\n\nThe mathematical conception of relevance has been disputed. At a\ntrial, it is very common for the opposing sides to present competing\naccounts of events that share certain features. To use Allen\u2019s\nexample, the fact that the accused drove to a particular town on a\nparticular day and time is consistent with the prosecution\u2019s\ncase that he was driving there to commit a murder and also with the\ndefence\u2019s case that he was driving there to visit his mother.\nThis fact, being a common feature of both sides\u2019 explanations of\nthe material events, is as consistent with the hypothesis of guilt as\nwith the hypothesis of innocence. On the likelihood ratio conception\nof relevance, this fact should be irrelevant and hence evidence of it\nshould not be allowed to be adduced. But in such cases, the court will\nlet the evidence in (Park et al. 2010: 10). The mathematical theory of\nrelevance cannot account for this. (For critical discussion of this\nclaim, see section 4.2 of the entry on \n legal probabilism.) It is\nargued that an alternative theory of relevance better fits legal\npractice and is thus to be preferred. On an explanatory conception of\nrelevance, evidence is relevant if it is explained by or provides a\nreason for believing the particular explanation of the material events\noffered by the side adducing the evidence, and it remains relevant\neven where, as in our example, the evidence also supports or forms\npart of the explanation offered by the opponent (Pardo and Allen 2008:\n241\u20132; Pardo 2013: 600).\n\nOne possible response to the above challenge to the likelihood ratio\ntheory of relevance is to deny that it was ever meant to be the\nexclusive test of relevance. Evidence is relevant if the\nlikelihood ratio is other than 1:1. But evidence may also be relevant\non other grounds, such as when it provides for a richer narrative or\nhelps the court in understanding other evidence. It is for these\nreasons that witnesses are routinely allowed to give their names and\nparties may present diagrams, charts and floor plans (so-called\n\u201cdemonstrative evidence\u201d) at the trial (McCormick 2013:\n995). The admission of evidence in the scenario painted by Allen above\nhas been explained along a similar line (Park et al. 2010: 16).\n2.1.3 Logical Relevance versus Legal Relevance\n\nThe concept of relevance examined in the preceding section is commonly\nknown as \u201clogical relevance\u201d. This is somewhat of a\nmisnomer: \u201cRelevance is not a matter of logic, but depends on\nmatters of fact\u201d (Haack 2004: 46). In our earlier example, the\nrelevance of the fact that the accused has type A blood depends\nobviously on the state of the world. On the understanding that\nrelevance is a probabilistic relation, it is tempting to think that in\ndescribing relevance as \u201clogical\u201d, one is subscribing to a\nlogical theory of probability (cf. Franklin 2011). However, the term\n\u201clogical relevance\u201d was not originally coined with this\nconnotation in mind. In the forensic context, \u201clogic\u201d is\nused loosely and refers to the stock of background beliefs or\ngeneralisations and the type of reasoning that judges and lawyers are\nfond of labelling as \u201ccommonsense\u201d (MacCrimmon\n2001\u20132002; Twining 2006: 334\u2013335).\n\nA key purpose of using the adjective \u201clogical\u201d is to flag\nthe non-legal character of relevance. As Thayer (1898: 269) famously\nclaimed, relevance \u201cis an affair of logic and not of law.\u201d\nThis is not to say that relevance has no legal dimension. The law\ndistinguishes between questions of law and questions of fact. An issue\nof relevance poses a question of law that is for the judge to decide\nand not the jury, and so far as relevance is defined in legal sources\n(for example, in Federal Rule of Evidence 401 mentioned above), the\njudge must pay heed to the legal definition. But legal definitions of\nrelevance are invariably very broad. Relevance is said to be a\nlogical, and non-legal, concept in the sense that in answering a\nquestion of relevance and in applying the definition of relevance, the\njudge has necessarily to rely on extra-legal resources and is not\nbound by legal precedents. Returning to Federal Rule of Evidence 401,\nit states generally that evidence is relevant if \u201cit has a\ntendency to make a fact more or less probable than it would be without\nthe evidence\u201d. In deciding whether the evidence sought to be\nadduced does have this tendency, the judge has to look outside the\nlaw. Thayer was most insistent on this. As he put it, \u201c[t]he law\nfurnishes no test of relevancy. For this, it tacitly refers to logic\nand general experience\u201d (Thayer 1898: 265). That the\naccused\u2019s favorite color is blue is, barring extraordinary\ncircumstances, irrelevant to the question of his intention to commit\ntheft. It is not the law that tells us so but \u201clogic and general\nexperience\u201d. On Thayer\u2019s view, the law does not control or\nregulate the assessment of relevance; it assumes that judges are\nalready in possession of the (commonsense) resources to undertake this\nassessment.\n\nWigmore adopts a different position. He argues, against Thayer, that\nrelevance is a legal concept. There are two strands to his contention.\nThe first is that for evidence to be relevant in law, \u201ca\ngenerally higher degree of probative value\u201d is required\n\u201cthan would be asked in ordinary reasoning\u201d:\n\n\nlegal relevance denotes\u2026something more than a minimum of\nprobative value. Each single piece of evidence must have a plus value.\n(cf. Pattenden 1996\u20137: 373)\n\n\nAs Wigmore sees it, the requirement of \u201cplus value\u201d guards\nagainst the jury \u201cbeing satisfied by matters of slight value,\ncapable to being exaggerated by prejudice and hasty reasoning\u201d\n(Wigmore 1983b: 969, cf. 1030\u20131031). Opponents of Wigmore\nacknowledge that there may be sound policy reasons for excluding\nevidence of low probative value. Receiving the evidence at the trial\nmight raise a multiplicity of issues, incur too much time and expense,\nconfuse the jurors or produce undue prejudice in their mind. When the\njudge excludes evidence for any of these reasons, and the judge has\nthe discretion to do so in many countries, the evidence is excluded\ndespite it being relevant (e.g., United States\u2019 Federal\nRule of Evidence 403). Relevance is a relation between facts and the\naforesaid reasons for exclusion are extrinsic to that relation; they\nare grounded in considerations such as limitation of judicial\nresources and jury psychology. The notion of \u201cplus value\u201d\nconfuses relevance with extraneous considerations (James 1941;\nTrautman 1952).\n\nThere is a second strand to Wigmore\u2019s contention that relevance\nis a legal concept. Relevance is legal in the sense that the judge is\nbound by previously decided cases (\u201cjudicial precedents\u201d)\nwhen he has to make a ruling on the relevance of a proposed item of\nevidence.\n\n\nSo long as Courts continue to declare\u2026what their notions of\nlogic are, just so long will there be rules of law which must be\nobserved. (Wigmore 1983a: 691)\n\n\nWigmore cites in support the judgment of Cushing C.J. in State v\nLaPage where it was remarked:\n\n\n[T]here are many instances in which the evidence of particular facts\nas bearing on particular issues has been so often the subject of\ndiscussion in courts of law, and so often ruled upon, that the united\nlogic of a great many judges and lawyers may be said to\nfurnish\u2026the best evidence of what may be properly called\ncommon-sense, and thus to acquire the authority of law. (1876\n57 N.H. 245 at 288 [Supreme Court, New Hampshire])\n\n\nWigmore\u2019s position on relevance is strangely at odds with his\nstrong stand against the judge being bound by judicial precedents in\nassessing the weight or credibility of evidence (Wigmore 1913). More\nimportantly, the second strand of his argument also does not sit well\nwith the first strand. If, as Wigmore contends, evidence must have a\nplus value to make it legally relevant, the court has to consider the\nprobative value of the evidence and to weigh it against the amount of\ntime and expense likely to be incurred in receiving the evidence, the\navailability of other evidence, the risk of the evidence misleading or\nconfusing the trier of fact and so forth. Given that the assessment of\nplus value and, hence, legal relevance is so heavily contextual, it is\ndifficult to see how a judicial precedent can be of much value in\nanother case in determining a point of legal relevance (James 1941:\n702).\n2.2 Materiality and Facts-in-issue\n\nWe have just considered the first condition of receivability, namely,\nrelevance. That fact A is relevant to fact B is not\nsufficient to make evidence of fact A receivable in court. In\naddition, B must be a \u201cmaterial\u201d fact. The\nmateriality of facts in a particular case is determined by the law\napplicable to that case. In a criminal prosecution, it depends on the\nlaw which defines the offence with which the accused is charged and at\na civil trial, the law which sets out the elements of the legal claim\nthat is being brought against the defendant (Wigmore 1983a,\n15\u201319; Montrose 1954: 536\u2013537).\n\nImagine that the accused is prosecuted for the crime of rape and the\nalleged victim\u2019s behaviour (fact A) increases the\nprobability that she had consented to have sexual intercourse with the\naccused (fact B). On the probabilistic theory of relevance\nthat we have considered, A is relevant to B. Now\nsuppose that the alleged victim is a minor. Under criminal law, it\ndoes not matter whether she had consented to the sexual intercourse.\nIf B is of no legal consequence, the court will not allow\nevidence of A to be adduced for the purpose of proving\nB: the most obvious reason is that it is a waste of time to\nreceive the evidence.\n\nNot all material facts are necessarily in dispute. Suppose the\nplaintiff sues the defendant for breach of contract. Under the law of\ncontract, to succeed in this action, the plaintiff must prove the\nfollowing three elements: that there was a contract between the\nparties, that the defendant was in breach of the contract, and that\nthe plaintiff had suffered loss as a result of that breach. The\ndefendant may concede that there was a contract and that he was in\nbreach of it but deny that the plaintiff had suffered any loss as a\nresult of that breach. In such a situation, only the last of the\nmaterial facts is disputed. Following Stephen\u2019s terminology, a\ndisputed material fact is called a \u201cfact in issue\u201d\n(Stephen 1872: 9).\n\nThe law does not allow evidence to be adduced to prove facts that are\nimmaterial. Whether evidence may be adduced to prove a material fact\nmay depend on whether the material fact is disputed; for\ninstance, the requirement that it must be disputed\nexists under Rule 210 of the Evidence Code of California but not\nRule 401 of the Federal Rules of Evidence in the United States.\n\u201cRelevance\u201d is often used in the broader sense that\nencompasses the concepts under discussion. Evidence is sometimes\ndescribed as \u201cirrelevant\u201d not for the reason that no\nlogical inference can be drawn to the proposition that is sought to be\nproved (in our example, A is strictly speaking relevant to\nB) but because that proposition is not material or not\ndisputed (in our example, B is not\n material).[10]\n This broader usage of the term \u201crelevance\u201d, though\notherwise quite harmless, does not promote conceptual clarity because\nit runs together different concepts (see James 1941: 690\u2013691;\nTrautman 1952: 386; Montrose 1954: 537).\n2.3 Admissibility\n2.3.1 Admissibility and Relevance\n\nA further condition must be satisfied for evidence to be received in\nlegal proceedings. There are legal rules that prohibit evidence from\nbeing presented at a trial even though it is relevant to a factual\nproposition that is material and in issue. These rules render the\nevidence to which they apply \u201cinadmissible\u201d and require\nthe judge to \u201cexclude\u201d it. Two prominent examples of such\nrules of admissibility or rules of exclusion are the rule against\nhearsay evidence and the rule against character evidence. This section\nconsiders the relation between the concept of relevance and the\nconcept of admissibility. The next section\n (section 2.3.2)\n discusses general arguments for and against exclusionary or\nadmissibility rules.\n\nHere, again, the terminology is imprecise. Admissibility and\nreceivability are not clearly distinguished. It is common for\nirrelevant evidence, or evidence of an immaterial\nfact to be described as \u201cinadmissible\u201d. What this means is\nthat the court will refuse to receive evidence if it is irrelevant or\nimmaterial. But, importantly, the court also excludes evidence for\nreasons other than irrelevance and immateriality. For Montrose, there\nis merit in restricting the concept of \u201cinadmissibility\u201d\nto the exclusion of evidence based on those other reasons (Montrose\n1954: 541\u2013543). If evidence is rejected on the ground of\nirrelevance, it is, as Thayer (1898: 515) puts it, \u201cthe rule of\nreason that rejects it\u201d; if evidence is rejected under an\nadmissibility or exclusionary rule, the rejection is by force of law.\nThe concepts of admissibility and materiality should also be kept\napart. This is because admissibility or exclusionary rules serve\npurposes and rationales that are distinct from the law defining the\ncrime or civil claim that is before the court and it is this law that\ndetermines the materiality of facts in the dispute.\n\nThayer (1898: 266, 530) was influential in his view that the law of\nevidence has no say on logical relevance and that its main business is\nin dealing with admissibility. If the evidence is logically\nirrelevant, it must for that reason be excluded. If the evidence is\nlogically relevant, it will be received by the court unless the\nlaw\u2014in the form of an exclusionary or admissibility\nrule\u2014requires its exclusion. In this scheme, the concept of\nrelevance and the concept of admissibility are distinct: indeed,\nadmissibility rules presuppose the relevance of the evidence to which\nthey apply.\n\nStephen appears to hold a different view, one in which the concept of\nadmissibility is apparently absorbed by the concept of relevance.\nTake, for example, Stephen\u2019s analysis of the rule that in\ngeneral no evidence may be adduced to prove \u201cstatements as to\nfacts made by persons not called as witnesses\u201d, in short,\nhearsay (Stephen 1872: 122). As a general rule, no evidence may be\ngiven of hearsay because the law prohibits it. The question then\narises as to the rationale for this prohibition. Stephen\u2019s\nanswer to this question is often taken to be that hearsay is not\n\u201crelevant\u201d and he is criticised for failing to see the\ndifference between relevance and admissibility (Whitworth 1881: 3;\nThayer 1898: 266\u2013268; Pollock 1876, 1899; Wigmore 1983a:\n\u00a712). His critics point out that hearsay has or can have\nprobative value and evidence of hearsay is excluded despite or\nregardless of its relevance. On the generalisation that there is no\nsmoke without fire, the fact that a person claimed that p in\na statement made out-of-court does or can have a bearing on the\nprobability that p, and p may be (logically relevant\nto) a material fact in the dispute.\n\nInterestingly, Stephen seemed to have conceded as much. He\nacknowledged that a policeman or a lawyer engaged in preparing a case\nwould be negligent if he were to shut his ears to hearsay. Hearsay is\none of those facts that are \u201capparently relevant but not really\nso\u201d (Stephen 1872: 122; see also Stephen 1886: xi). In claiming\nthat hearsay is irrelevant, Stephen appears to be merely stating the\neffect of the law: the law requires that hearsay be treated as\nirrelevant. He offered a variety of justifications for excluding\nhearsay evidence: its admissibility would \u201cpresent a great\ntemptation to indolent judges to be satisfied with second-hand\nreports\u201d and \u201copen a wide door to fraud\u201d, with the\nresult that \u201c[e]veryone would be at the mercy of people who\nmight tell a lie, and whose evidence could neither be tested nor\ncontradicted\u201d (Stephen 1872: 124\u2013125). For his detractors,\nthese are reasons of policy and fairness and it disserves clarity to\nsneak such considerations into the concept of relevance.\n\nAlthough there is force to the criticism that Stephen had unhelpfully\nconflated admissibility and relevance (understood as logical\nrelevance), something can perhaps be said in his defence. Exclusionary\nrules or rules of admissibility\u2014at any rate, many of\nthem\u2014are more accurately seen as excluding forms of reasoning\nrather than prohibiting proof of certain types of facts (McNamara\n1986). This is certainly true of the hearsay rule. On one\nauthoritative definition of the rule (decision of the Privy Council in\nSubramaniam v PP, (1956) 1 Weekly Law Reports 965),\nwhat it prohibits is the use of a hearsay statement to prove the truth\nof the facts asserted\n therein.[11]\n The objection is to the drawing of the inference that p from\nX\u2019s out-of-court statement that p where\nX is not available to be examined in court. But the court\nwill allow the evidence of X\u2019s hearsay statement to be\nadmitted\u2014it will allow proof of the statement\u2014 where the\npurpose of adducing the evidence is to persuade the court that\nX did make the statement and this fact is relevant for some\nother purpose. For instance, it may be relevant as to the state of\nmind of the person hearing the statement, and his state of mind may be\nmaterial to his defence of having acted under duress. Hence, two\nwriters have commented that \u201cthere is no such thing as hearsay\nevidence, only hearsay uses\u201d (Roberts and\nZuckerman 2010: 385).\n\nOther admissibility rules are also more accurately seen as targeted at\nforms of reasoning and not types of facts. In the United States,\nFederal Rule of Evidence 404(a)(1) bars the use of evidence of a\nperson\u2019s character \u201cto prove that on a particular occasion\nthe person acted in accordance with the character\u201d and Federal\nRule of Evidence 404(b)(1) provides that evidence of a crime or\nwrong\n\n\nis not admissible to prove a person\u2019s character in order to show\nthat on a particular occasion the person acted in accordance with the\ncharacter.\n\n\nIt is doubtful that evidence of a person\u2019s character and past\nbehaviour can have no probabilistic bearing on his behaviour on a\nparticular occasion; on a probabilistic conception of relevance, it is\ndifficult to see why the evidence is not relevant. Even so, there may\nbe policy, moral or other reasons for the law to prohibit certain uses\nof character evidence. In declaring a fact as irrelevant for a\nparticular purpose, we are not necessarily saying or implying anything\nabout probability. We may be expressing a normative judgment. For\npolicy, moral or other reasons, the law takes the position that\nhearsay or the accused\u2019s character or previous misconduct must\nnot be used as the premise for a particular line of reasoning. The\nline of reasoning might be morally objectionable (\u201cgive a dog a\nbad name and hang him for it\u201d) or it might be unfair to permit\nthe drawing of the inference when the opponent was not given a fair\nopportunity to challenge it (as in the hearsay situation) (Ho 2008:\nchs. 5, 6). If we take a normative conception of relevance instead of\na logical or probabilistic one, it is not an abuse of language to\ndescribe inadmissible evidence as irrelevant if what is meant is that\nthe evidence ought not to be taken into account in a certain way.\n2.3.2 Admissibility or Exclusionary Rules\n\nOn one historical account, admissibility or exclusionary rules are the\nproduct of the jury system where citizens untrained in assessing\nevidence sit as judges of fact. These rules came about because it was\nthought necessary to keep away from inexperienced jurors certain types\nof evidence that may mislead or be mishandled by them\u2014for\ninstance, evidence to which they are likely to give too much weight or\nthat carries the risk of creating unfair prejudice in their minds\n(Thayer 1898; Wigmore 1935: 4\u20135). Epistemic paternalism is\nsupposedly at play (Leiter 1997: 814\u20135; Allen and Leiter 2001:\n1502). Subscription to this theory has generated pressure for the\nabolition of exclusionary rules with the decline of the jury system\nand the replacement of lay persons with professional judges as triers\nof fact. There is doubt as to the historical accuracy of this account;\nat any rate, it does not appear capable of explaining the growth of\nall exclusionary rules (Morgan 1936\u201337; Nance 1988:\n278\u2013294).\n\nEven if the theory is right, it does not necessarily follow that\nexclusionary rules should be abolished once the jury system is\nremoved. Judges may be as susceptible to the same cognitive and other\nfailings as the jury and there may be the additional risk that judges\nmay over-estimate their own cognitive and intellectual abilities in\ntheir professional domain. Hence, there remains a need for the\nconstraints of legal rules (Schauer 2006: 185\u2013193). But the\nefficacy of these rules in a non-jury system is questionable. The\nprocedural reality is that judges will have to be exposed to the\nevidence in order to decide on its admissibility. Since a judge cannot\nrealistically be expected to erase the evidence from his mind once he\nhas decided to exclude it, there seems little point in excluding the\nevidence; we might as well let the evidence in and allow judge to give\nthe evidence the probative value that it deserves (Mnookin 2006;\nDama\u0161ka 2006; cf. Ho 2008: 44\u201346).\n\nBentham was a strong critic of exclusionary rules. He was much in\nfavour of \u201cfreedom of proof\u201d understood as free access to\ninformation and the absence of formal rules that restrict such access\n(Twining 2006: 232, n 65). The direct object of legal procedure is the\n\u201crectitude of decision\u201d, by which he means the correct\napplication of substantive law to true findings of facts. The\nexclusion of relevant evidence\u2014evidence capable of casting light\non the truth\u2014is detrimental to this end. Hence, no relevant\nevidence should be excluded; the only exceptions he would allow are\nwhere the evidence is superfluous or its production would involve\npreponderant delay, expense or vexation (Bentham 1827: Book IX;\nBentham 1825: Book VII; Twining 1985: ch. 2). Bentham\u2019s argument\nhas been challenged on various fronts. It is said that he overvalued\nthe pursuit of truth, undervalued procedural fairness and procedural\nrights, and placed too much faith in officials, underestimating the\nrisk of abuse when they are given discretion unfettered by rules\n(Twining 1985: 70\u201371).\n\nEven if we agree with Bentham that rectitude of decision is the aim of\nlegal procedure and that achieving accuracy in fact-finding is\nnecessary to attain this aim, it is not obvious that a rule-based\napproach to admissibility will undermine this aim in the long run.\nSchauer has defended exclusionary rules of evidence along a\nrule-consequentialist line. Having the triers of fact follow rules on\ncertain matters instead of allowing them the discretion to exercise\njudgment on a case-by-case basis may produce the greatest number of\nfavourable outcomes in the aggregate. It is in the nature of a formal\nrule that it has to be followed even when doing so might not serve the\nbackground reason for the rule. If hearsay evidence is thought to be\ngenerally unreliable, the interest of accuracy may be better served\noverall to require such evidence to be excluded without regard to its\nreliability in individual cases. Given the imperfection of human\nreason and our suspicion about the reasoning ability of the\nfact-finder, allowing decisions to be taken individually on the\nreliability and admissibility of hearsay evidence might over time\nproduce a larger proportion of misjudgements than on the rule-based\napproach (Schauer 2006: 180\u2013185; Schauer 2008). However, this\nargument is based on a large assumption about the likely effects of\nhaving exclusionary rules and not having them, and there is no strong\nempirical basis for thinking that the consequences are or will be as\nalleged (Goldman 1999: 292\u2013295; Laudan 2006: 121\u2013122).\n\nOther supporters of exclusionary rules build their arguments on a wide\nrange of different considerations. The literature is too vast to enter\ninto details. Here is a brief mention of some arguments. On one\ntheory, some exclusionary rules are devices that serve as incentives\nfor lawyers to produce the epistemically best evidence that is\nreasonably available (Nance 1988, 2016: 195\u2013201). For example,\nif lawyers are not allowed to rely on second-hand (hearsay) evidence,\nthey will be forced to seek out better (first-hand) evidence. On\nanother theory, exclusionary rules allocate the risks of error. Again,\nconsider hearsay. The problem with allowing a party to rely on hearsay\nevidence is that the opponent has no opportunity to cross-examine the\noriginal maker of the statement and is thus deprived of an important\nmeans of attacking the reliability of the evidence. Exclusionary rules\nin general insulate the party against whom the evidence is sought to\nbe adduced from the risks of error that the evidence, if admitted,\nwould have introduced. The distribution of such risks is said to be a\npolitical decision that should not be left to the discretion of\nindividual fact-finders (Stein 2005; cf. Redmayne 2006 and Nance\n2007a: 154\u2013164). It has also been argued that the hearsay rule\nand the accompanying right to confront witnesses promote the public\nacceptance and stability of legal verdicts. If the court relies on\ndirect evidence, it can claim superior access to the facts (having\nheard from the horse\u2019s mouth, so to speak) and this also reduces\nthe risk of new information emerging after the trial to discredit the\ninference that was drawn from the hearsay evidence (the original maker\nof the statement might turn up after the trial to deny the truth of\nthe statement that was attributed to him) (Nesson 1985:\n1372\u20131375; cf. Park 1986; Goldman 1999: 282; Goldman 2005:\n166\u2013167).\n3. Strength of Evidence\n\nThe decision whether to allow a party to adduce a particular item of\nevidence is one that the judge has to make and arises in the course of\na trial.\n Section 2\n above dealt with the conditions that must be satisfied for a\nwitness\u2019s testimony, a document or an object to be received as\nevidence. At the end of the trial, the fact-finder must consider all\nthe evidence that has been presented and reach a verdict. Although\nverdict deliberation is sometimes subjected to various forms of\ncontrol through legal devices such as presumptions and corroboration\nrules, such control is limited and the fact-finder is expected to\nexercise personal judgment in the evaluation of evidence\n(Dama\u0161ka 2019). Having heard or seen the evidence, the\nfact-finder now has to evaluate or \u2018weigh\u2019 it in reaching\nthe verdict. Weight can refer to any of the following three properties\nof evidence: (a) the probative value of individual items of evidence,\n(b) the sufficiency of the whole body of evidence adduced at the trial\nin meeting the standard of proof, or (c) the relative completeness of\nthis body of evidence. The first two aspects of weight are familiar to\nlegal practitioners but the third has been confined to academic\ndiscussions. These three ideas are discussed in the same order\nbelow.\n3.1 Probative Value of Specific Items of Evidence\n\nIn reaching the verdict, the trier of fact has to assess the probative\nvalue of the individual items of evidence which have been received at\nthe trial. The concept of probative value can also play a role at the\nprior stage (which was the focus in\n section 2)\n where the judge has to make a ruling on whether to receive the\nevidence in the first place. In many legal systems, if the judge finds\nthe probative value of a proposed item of evidence to be low and\nsubstantially outweighed by countervailing considerations, such as the\nrisk of causing unfair prejudice or confusion, the judge can refuse to\nlet the jury hear or see the evidence (see, e.g., Rule 403 of the\nUnited States\u2019 Federal Rules of Evidence).\n\nThe concept of probative value (or, as it is also called, probative\nforce) is related to the concept of relevance.\n Section 2.1.2\n above introduced and examined the claim that the likelihood ratio is\nthe measure of relevance. To recapitulate, the likelihood of an item\nof evidence, E (in our previous example, the likelihood of a\nblood type match) given a hypothesis H (that the accused is\nin fact guilty) is compared with the likelihood of E given\nthe negation of H (that the accused is in fact innocent).\nPrior to the introduction of E, one may have formed some\nbelief about H based on other evidence that one already has.\nThis prior belief does not affect the likelihood ratio since its\ncomputation is based on the alternative assumptions that H is\ntrue and that H is false (Kaye 1986a; Kaye and Koehler 2003;\ncf. Davis and Follette 2002 and 2003). Rulings on relevance are\nmade by the judge when objections of irrelevance\nare raised in the course of the trial. The relevance of\nan item of evidence is supposedly assessed on its own, without\nconsideration of other evidence, and, indeed, much of the other\nevidence may have yet to presented at the point when the judge\nrules on the relevance of a particular item of\nevidence (Mnookin 2013:\n 1544\u20135).[12]\n\nProbative value, as with relevance, has been explained in terms of the\nlikelihood ratio (for detailed examples, see Nance and Morris 2002;\nFinkelstein and Levin 2003). It was noted earlier that evidence is\neither relevant or not, and, on the prevailing understanding, it is\nrelevant so long as the likelihood ratio deviates from 1:1. But\nevidence can be more or less probative depending on the value of the\nlikelihood ratio. In our earlier example, the probative value of a\nblood type match was 1.0:0.5 (or 2:1) as 50% of the suspect population\nhad the same blood type as the accused. But suppose the blood type is\nless common and only 25% of the suspect population has it. The\nprobative value of the evidence is now 1.0:0.25 (or 4:1). In both\ncases, the evidence is relevant; but the probative value is greater in\nthe latter than in the former scenario. It is tempting to describe\nprobative value as the degree of relevance but this would be\nmisleading as relevance in law is a binary concept.\n\nThere is a second way of thinking about probative value. On the second\nview, but not on the first, the probative value of an item of evidence\nis assessed contextually. The probative value of E may be low\ngiven one state of the other evidence and substantial given a\ndifferent body of other evidence (Friedman 1986; Friedman and Park\n2003; cf. Davis and Follette 2002, 2003). Where the other evidence\nshows that a woman had died from falling down an escalator at a mall\nwhile she was out shopping, her husband\u2019s history of spousal\nbattery is unlikely to have any probative value in proving that he was\nresponsible for her death. But where the other evidence shows that the\nwife had died of injuries in the matrimonial home, and the question is\nwhether the injuries were sustained from an accidental fall from the\nstairs or inflicted by the husband, the same evidence of spousal\nbattery will now have significant probative value.\n\nOn the second view, the probative value of an item of evidence\n(E) is not measured simply by the likelihood ratio as it is\non the first view. Probative value is understood as the degree to\nwhich E increases (or decreases) the probability of the\nproposition or hypothesis (H) in support of (or against)\nwhich E is led. The probative value of E is measured\nby the difference between the probability of H given\nE (the posterior probability) and the probability of\nH absent E (the prior probability) (Friedman 1986;\nJames 1941: 699).\n\nProbative value of \\(E = P(H | E) - P(H)\\)\n\n\\(P(H | E)\\) (the posterior probability) is derived by applying\nBayes\u2019 theorem\u2014that is, by multiplying the prior\nprobability by the likelihood ratio (see discussion in\n section 3.2.2\n below). On the present view, while the likelihood ratio does not\nitself measure the probative value of E, it is nevertheless a\ncrucial component in the assessment.\n\nA major difficulty with both of the mathematical conceptions of\nprobative value that we have just examined is that for most evidence,\nobtaining the figures necessary for computing the likelihood ratio is\nproblematic (Allen 1991: 380). Exceptionally, quantitative base rates\ndata exist, as in our blood type example. Where objective data is\nunavailable, the fact-finder has to draw on background experience and\nknowledge to come up with subjective values. In our blood type\nexample, a critical factor in computing the likelihood ratio was the\npercentage of the \u201csuspect population\u201d who had the same\nblood type as the accused. \u201cReference class\u201d is the\ngeneral statistical term for the role that the suspect population\nplays in this analysis. How should the reference class of\n\u201csuspect population\u201d be defined? Should we look at the\npopulation of the country as a whole or of the town or the street\nwhere the alleged murder occurred? What if it occurred at an\ninternational airport where most the people around are foreign\nvisitors? Or what if it is shown that both the accused and the victim\nwere at the time of the alleged murder inmates of the same prison?\nShould we then take the prison population as the reference class? The\ndistribution of blood types may differ according to which reference\nclass is selected. Sceptics of mathematical modelling of probative\nvalue emphasize that data from different reference classes will have\ndifferent explanatory power and the choice of the reference class is\nopen to\u2014and should be subjected to\u2014contextual argument and\nrequires the exercise of judgment; there is no a priori way of\ndetermining the correct reference class. (On the reference class\nproblem in legal factfinding, see, in addition to references cited in\nthe rest of this section, Colyvan, Regan, and Ferson 2001; Tillers\n2005; Allen and Roberts 2007.)\n\nSome writers have proposed quantifiable ways of selecting, or\nassisting in the selection, of the appropriate reference class. On one\nsuggestion, the court does not have to search for the optimal\nreference class. A general characteristic of an adversarial system of\ntrial is that the judge plays a passive role; it is up to the parties\nto come up with the arguments on which they want to rely and to\nproduce evidence in support of their respective arguments. This\nadversarial setting makes the reference class problem more manageable\nas the court need only to decide which of the reference classes relied\nupon by the parties is to be preferred. And this can be done by\napplying one of a variety of technical criteria that statisticians\nhave developed for comparing and selecting statistical models (Cheng\n2009). Another suggestion is to use the statistical method of\n\u201cfeature selection\u201d instead. The ideal reference class is\ndefined by the intersection of all relevant features of the case, and\na feature is relevant if it is correlated to the matter under enquiry\n(Franklin 2010, 2011: 559\u2013561). For instance, if the amount of\ndrug likely to be smuggled is reasonably believed to co-vary with the\nairport through which it is smuggled, the country of origin and the\ntime period, and there is no evidence that any other feature is\nrelevant on which data is available, the ideal reference class is the\nclass of drug smugglers passing through that airport originating from\nthat country and during that time period. Both suggestions have\nself-acknowledged limitations: not least, they depend on the\navailability of suitable data. Also, as Franklin stresses, while\nstatistical methods \u201chave advice to offer on how courts should\njudge quantitative evidence\u201d, they do so \u201cin a way that\nsupplements normal intuitive legal argument rather than replacing it\nby a formula\u201d (Franklin 2010: 22).\n\nThe reference class problem is not confined to the probabilistic\nassessment of the probative value of individual items of evidence. It\nis a general difficulty with a mathematical approach to legal proof.\nIn particular, the same problem arises on a probabilistic\ninterpretation of the standard of proof when the court has to\ndetermine whether the standard is met based on all the evidence\nadduced in the case. This topic is explored in\n section 3.2\n below but it is convenient at this juncture to illustrate how the\nreference class problem can also arise in this connection. Let it be\nthat the plaintiff sues Blue Bus Company to recover compensation for\ninjuries sustained in an accident. The plaintiff testifies, and the\ncourt believes on the basis of his testimony, that he was run down by\na recklessly driven bus. Unfortunately, it was dark at the time and he\ncannot tell whether the bus belonged to Blue Bus Company. Assume\nfurther that there is also evidence which establishes that Blue Bus\nCompany owns 75% of the buses in the town where the accident occurred\nand the remaining 25% is owned by Red Bus Company. No other evidence\nis presented. To use the data as the basis for inferring that there is\n0.75 probability that the bus involved in the accident was owned by\nBlue Bus Company would seem to privilege the reference class of\n\u201cbuses operating in the town\u201d over other possible\nreference classes such as \u201cbuses plying the street where the\naccident occurred\u201d or \u201cbuses operating at the time in\nquestion\u201d (Allen and Pardo 2007a: 109). Different reference\nclasses may produce very different likelihood ratios. It is crucial\nhow the reference class is chosen and this is ultimately a matter of\nargument and judgment. Any choice of reference class (other than the\nclass that shares every feature of the particular incident,\nwhich is, in effect, the unique incident itself) is in principle\ncontestable.\n\nCritics of the mathematization of legal proof raise this point as an\nexample of inherent limitations to the mathematical modelling of\nprobative value (Allen and Pardo\n 2007a).[13]\n Allen and Pardo propose an alternative, the explanatory theory of\nlegal proof. They claim that this theory has the advantage of avoiding\nthe reference class problem because it does not attempt to quantify\nprobative value (Pardo 2005: 374\u2013383; Pardo and Allen 2008: 261,\n263; Pardo 2013: 600\u2013601). Suppose a man is accused of killing\nhis wife. Evidence is produced of his extra-marital affair. The unique\nprobative value of the accused\u2019s infidelity cannot be\nmathematically computed from statistical base rates of infidelity and\nuxoricides (husbands murdering wives). In assessing its probative\nvalue, the court should look instead at how strongly the evidence of\ninfidelity supports the explanation of the material events put forward\nby the side adducing the evidence and how strongly it challenges the\nexplanation offered by the opponent. For instance, the prosecution may\nbe producing the evidence to buttress its case that the accused wanted\nto get rid of his wife so that he could marry his mistress, and the\ndefence may be advancing the alternative theory that the couple was\nunusual in that they condoned extra-marital affairs and had never let\nit affect their loving relationship. How much probative value the\nevidence of infidelity has depends on the strength of the explanatory\nconnections between it and the competing hypotheses, and this is not\nsomething that can be quantified.\n\nBut the disagreement in this debate is not as wide as it might appear.\nThe critics concede that formal models for evaluating evidence in law\nmay be useful. What they object to is\n\n\nscholarship arguing \u2026 that such models establish the correct or\naccurate probative value of evidence, and thus implying that any\ndeviations from such models lead to inaccurate or irrational outcomes.\n(Allen and Pardo 2007b: 308)\n\n\nOn the other side, it is acknowledged that there are limits to\nmathematical formalisation of evidential reasoning in law (Franklin\n2012: 238\u20139) and that context, argument and judgment do play a\nrole in identifying the reference class (Nance 2007b).\n3.2 Sufficiency of Evidence and the Standards of Proof\n3.2.1 Mathematical Probability and the Standards of Proof\n\nIn the\n section 3.1\n above, we concentrated on the weight of evidence in the sense of\nprobative value of individual items of evidence. The concept of weight\ncan also apply to the total body of evidence presented at the trial;\nhere \u201cweight\u201d is commonly referred to as the\n\u201csufficiency of \n evidence\u201d.[14]\n The law assigns the legal\nburden of proof between parties to a dispute. For instance, at a\ncriminal trial, the accused is presumed innocent and the burden is on\nthe prosecution to prove that he is guilty as charged. To secure a\nconviction, the body of evidence presented at the trial must be\nsufficient to meet the standard of proof. Putting this generally, a\nverdict will be given in favour of the side bearing the legal burden\nof proof only if, having considered all of the evidence, the\nfact-finder is satisfied that the applicable standard of proof is met.\nThe standard of proof has been given different interpretations.\n\nOn one interpretation, the standard of proof is a probabilistic\nthreshold. In civil cases, the standard is the \u201cbalance of\nprobabilities\u201d or, as it is more popularly called in the United\nStates, the \u201cpreponderance of evidence\u201d. The plaintiff\nwill satisfy this standard and succeed in his claim only if there is,\non all the evidence adduced in the case, more than 0.5 probability of\nhis claim being true. At criminal trials, the standard for a guilty\nverdict is \u201cproof beyond a reasonable doubt\u201d. Here the\nprobabilistic threshold is thought to be much higher than 0.5 but\ncourts have eschewed any attempt at authoritative quantification.\nTypically, a notional value, such as 0.9 or 0.95, is assumed by\nwriters for the sake of discussion. For the prosecution to secure a\nguilty verdict, the evidence adduced at the trial must establish the\ncriminal charge to a degree of probability that crosses this\nthreshold. Where, as in the United States, there is an intermediate\nstandard of \u201cclear and convincing evidence\u201d which is\nreserved for special cases, the probabilistic threshold is said to lie\nsomewhere between 0.5 and the threshold for proof beyond reasonable\ndoubt.\n\nKaplan was among the first to employ decision theory to develop a\nframework for setting the probabilistic threshold that represents the\nstandard of proof. Since the attention in this area of the law tends\nto be on the avoidance of errors and their undesirable consequences,\nhe finds it convenient to focus on disutility rather than utility. The\nexpected disutility of an outcome is the product of the disutility\n(broadly, the social costs) of that outcome and the probability of\nthat outcome. Only two options are generally available to the court:\nin criminal cases, it must either convict or acquit the accused and in\ncivil cases, it has to give judgment either for the plaintiff or for\nthe defendant. At a criminal trial, the decision should be made to\nconvict where the expected disutility of a decision to acquit is\ngreater than the expected disutility of a decision to convict. This is\nso as to minimize the expected disutilities. To put this in the form\nof an equation: \n\n\\[ P\\cdot\\textit{Dag} > (1-P)\\textit{Dci} \\]\n\n\nP is the probability that the accused is guilty on the basis\nof all the evidence adduced in the case, Dag is the\ndisutility of acquitting a guilty person and Dci is the\ndisutility of convicting an innocent person. A similar analysis\napplies to civil cases: the defendant should be found liable where the\nexpected disutility of finding him not liable when he is in fact\nliable exceeds the expected disutility of finding him liable when he\nis in fact not liable.\n\nOn this approach, a person should be convicted of a crime only where\nP is greater than: \n\n\\[ \\frac{1}{1+\\frac{\\textit{Dag}}{\\textit{Dci}}} \\]\n\n\nThe same formula applies in civil cases except that the two\ndisutilities (Dag and Dci) will have to be replaced\nby their civil equivalents (framed in terms of the disutility of\nawarding the judgment to a plaintiff who in fact does not deserve it\nand disutility of awarding the judgment to a defendant who in fact\ndoes not deserve it). On this formula, the crucial determinant of the\nstandard of proof is the ratio of the two disutilities. In the civil\ncontext, the disutility of an error in one direction is deemed equal\nto the disutility of an error in the other direction. Hence, a\nprobability of liability of greater than 0.5 would suffice for a\ndecision to enter judgment against the defendant (see Redmayne 1996:\n171). The situation is different at a criminal trial. Dci,\nthe disutility of convicting an innocent person is considered far\ngreater than Dag, the disutility of acquitting a guilty\n person.[15]\n Hence, the probability threshold for a conviction should be much\nhigher than 0.5 (Kaplan 1968: 1071\u20131073; see also Cullison\n1969).\n\nAn objection to this analysis is that it is incomplete. It is not\nenough to compare the costs of erroneous verdicts. The utility of an\naccurate conviction and the utility of an accurate acquittal should\nalso be considered and factored into the equation (Lillquist 2002:\n 108).[16]\n This results in the following modification of the formula for setting\nthe standard of proof: \n\n\\[ \\frac{1}{1+\\frac{\\textit{Ucg}-\\textit{Uag}}{\\textit{Uai}-\\textit{Uci}}} \\]\n\n\nUcg is the utility of convicting the guilty, Uag is\nthe utility of acquitting the guilty, Uai is the utility of\nacquitting the innocent and Uci the utility of convicting the\ninnocent.\n\nSince the relevant utilities depend on the individual circumstances,\nsuch as the seriousness of the crime and the severity of the\npunishment, the decision-theoretic account of the standard of proof\nwould seem, on both the simple and the modified version, to lead to\nthe conclusion that the probabilistic threshold should vary from case\nto case (Lillquist 2002; Bartels 1981; Laudan and Saunders 2009;\nRibeiro 2019). In other words, the standard of proof should be a\nflexible or floating one. This view is perceived to be\nproblematic.\n\nFirst, it falls short descriptively. The law requires the court to\napply a fixed standard of proof for all cases within the relevant\ncategory. In theory, all criminal cases are governed by the same high\nstandard and all civil cases are governed by the same lower standard.\nThat said, it is unclear whether factfinders in reality adhere\nstrictly to a fixed standard of proof (see Kaplow 2012:\n805\u2013809).\n\nThe argument is better interpreted as a normative argument\u2014as\nadvancing the claim about what the law ought to be and not what it is.\nThe standard of proof ought to vary from case to case. But this\nproposal faces a second objection. For convenience, the objection will\nbe elaborated in the criminal setting; in principle, civil litigants\nhave the same two rights that we shall identify. According to Dworkin\n(1981), moral harm arises as an objective moral fact when a person is\nerroneously convicted of a crime. Moral harm is distinguished from the\nbare harm (in the form of pain, frustration, deprivation of liberty\nand so forth) that is suffered by a wrongfully convicted and punished\nperson. While accused persons have the right not to be convicted if\ninnocent, they do not have the right to the most accurate procedure\npossible for ascertaining their guilt or innocence. However, they do\nhave the right that a certain weight or importance be attached to the\nrisk of moral harm in the design of procedural and evidential rules\nthat affect the level of accuracy. Accused persons have the further\nright to a consistent weighting of the importance of moral harm and\nthis further right stems from their right to equal concern and\nrespect. Dworkin\u2019s theory carries an implication bearing on the\npresent debate. It is arguable that to adopt a floating standard of\nproof would offend the second right insofar as it means treating\naccused persons differently with respect to the evaluation of the\nimportance of avoiding moral harm. This difference in treatment is\nreflected in the different level of the risk of moral harm to which\nthey are exposed.\n\nThere is a third objection to a floating standard of proof. Picinali\n(2013) sees fact-finding as a theoretical exercise that engages the\nquestion of what to believe about the disputed facts. What counts as\n\u201creasonable\u201d for the purposes of applying the standard of\nproof beyond reasonable doubt is accordingly a matter for theoretical\nas opposed to practical reasoning. Briefly, theoretical reasoning is\nconcerned with what to believe whereas practical reasoning is about\nwhat to do. Only reasons for belief are germane in theoretical\nreasoning. While considerations that bear on the assessment of utility\nand disutility provide reasons for action, they are not reasons for\nbelieving in the accused\u2019s guilt. Decision theory cannot\ntherefore be used to support a variable application of the standard of\nproof beyond reasonable doubt.\n\nThe third criticism of a flexible standard of proof does not directly\nchallenge the decision-theoretic analysis of the standard of proof. On\nthat analysis, it would seem that the maximisation of expected utility\nis the criterion for selecting the appropriate probabilistic threshold\nto apply and it plays no further role in deciding whether that\nthreshold, once selected, is met on the evidence adduced in the\nparticular case. It is not incompatible with the decision-theoretic\nanalysis to insist that the question of whether the selected threshold\nis met should be governed wholly by epistemic considerations. However,\nit is arguable that what counts as good or strong enough theoretical\nreason for judging, and hence believing, that something is true is\ndependent on the context, such as what is at stake in believing that\nit is true. More is at stake at a trial involving the death penalty\nthan in a case of petty shop-lifting; accordingly, there should be\nstronger epistemic justification for a finding of guilt in the first\nthan in the second case. Philosophical literature on epistemic\ncontextualism and on interest-relative accounts of knowledge and\njustified belief has been drawn upon to support a variant standard of\nproof (Ho 2008: ch. 4; see also Amaya 2015:\n 525\u2013531).[17]\n\nThe premise of the third criticism is that the trier of fact has to\nmake a finding on a disputed factual proposition based on his belief\nin the proposition. This is contentious. Beliefs are involuntary; we\ncannot believe something by simply deciding to believe it. The\ndominant view is that beliefs are context-independent; at any given\nmoment, we cannot believe something in one context and not believe it\nin another. On the other hand, legal fact-finding involves choice and\ndecision making and it is dependent on the context; for example,\nevidence that is strong enough to justify a finding of fact in a civil\ncase may not be strong enough to justify the same finding in a\ncriminal case where the standard of proof is higher. It has been\nargued that the fact-finder has to base his findings not on what he\nbelieves but what he accepts (Cohen 1991, 1992: 117\u2013125,\nBeltr\u00e1n 2006; cf. Picinali 2013: 868\u2013869). Belief and\nacceptance are propositional attitudes: they are different attitudes\nthat one can have in relation to a proposition. As Cohen (1992: 4)\nexplains:\n\n\nto accept that p is to have or adopt a policy of deeming,\npositing or postulating that p\u2014i.e. of including that\nproposition or rule among one\u2019s premises for deciding what to do\nor think in a particular context.\n\n3.2.2 Objections to Using Mathematical Probability to Interpret Standards of Proof\n\nUnderstanding standards of proof in terms of mathematical\nprobabilities is controversial. It is said to raise a number of\nparadoxes (Cohen 1977; Allen 1986, 1991; Allen and Leiter 2001;\nRedmayne 2008). Let us return to our previous example. The defendant,\nBlue Bus Company, owns 75% of the buses in the town where the\nplaintiff was injured by a recklessly driven bus and the remaining 25%\nis owned by Red Bus Company. No other evidence is presented. Leaving\naside the reference class problem discussed above, there is a 0.75\nprobability that the accident was caused by a bus owned by the\ndefendant. On the probabilistic interpretation of the applicable\nstandard of proof (that is, the balance of probabilities), the\nevidence should be sufficient to justify a verdict in the\nplaintiff\u2019s favour. But most lawyers would agree that the\nevidence is insufficient. Another familiar hypothetical scenario is\nset in the criminal context (Nesson 1979: 1192\u20131193). Twenty\nfive prisoners are exercising in a prison yard. Twenty four of them\nsuddenly set upon a guard and kill him. The remaining prisoner refuses\nto participate. We cannot in the ensuing confusion identify the\nprisoner who refrained from the attack. Subsequently, one prisoner is\nselected randomly and prosecuted for the murder of the guard. Those\nare the only facts presented at the trial. The applicable standard is\nproof beyond a reasonable doubt. Assume that the probabilistic\nthreshold of this standard is 0.95. On the statistical evidence, there\nis a probability of 0.96 that the defendant is criminally\n liable.[18]\n Despite the statistical probability of liability exceeding the\nthreshold, it is widely agreed that the defendant must be acquitted.\nIn both of the examples just described, why is the evidence\ninsufficient and what does this say about legal standards of\nproof?\n\nVarious attempts have been made to find the answers (for surveys of\nthese attempts, see Enoch and Fisher 2015: 565\u2013571; Redmayne\n2008, Ho 2008: 135\u2013143, 168\u2013170; Gardiner 2019b; section 6\nof the entry on \n legal probabilism). \n It has been argued that meeting a\nlegal standard of proof is not merely or fundamentally a matter of\nadducing evidence to establish a mathematical probability of liability\nbeyond a certain level. Standards of proof should be interpreted in\nepistemic rather than probabilistic terms. According to one\ninterpretation, the evidence is sufficient to satisfy a standard of\nproof only if it is capable of justifying full or outright belief in\nthe material facts that constitute legal liability and bare\nstatistical evidence, as in our examples, cannot justify such a\nbelief. (Nelkin 2021; Smith 2018; Buchak 2014; Ho 2008: 89\u201399.)\nOn Smith\u2019s account, the statistical evidence in our two examples\nfails to justify belief in the proposition that the defendant is\nliable because the evidence does not normically support that\nproposition. Evidence normically supports a proposition just in case\nthe situation in which the evidence is true and the proposition is\nfalse is less normal, in the sense of requiring more explanation, than\nthe situation in which the evidence and the proposition are both true.\nWhere all that we have is statistical evidence, it could just so\nhappen that the material proposition is false (it could just so happen\nthat the accident-causing bus was red or that the accused was the one\nwho refused to join in the murder), so no further explanation is\nneeded where the proposition is false than where it is true (Smith\n2018).\n\nOn a different epistemic interpretation, the evidence is sufficient to\nmeet a legal standard of proof, and a finding of legal liability is\npermissible, only if the factfinder can gain knowledge of the\ndefendant\u2019s liability\u2014to be precise, of the material facts\nestablishing such liability\u2014from the evidence (Duff et al. 2007:\n87\u201391; Pardo 2010; for a critical overview of knowledge-centered\naccounts, see Gardiner forthcoming). High probability of liability\nalone will not suffice. On more subtle knowledge-centered theories,\nthe standards of proof are met only if, on the available evidence,\nthere is a sufficiently high probability that the fact finder knows\nthat the defendant is liable (Littlejohn 2020 and 2021; Blome-Tillmann\n2017), or only if the fact finder\u2019s credence in the\ndefendant\u2019s liability exceeds the relevant legal threshold and\nthe credence constitutes knowledge (Moss 2018). It is further claimed\nthat the relevant knowledge necessary for a finding of liability\ncannot be obtained from statistical evidence alone (Littlejohn 2020\nand 2021; Blome-Tillmann 2017; Moss 2018 and forthcoming). According\nto Thomson, this is because the statistical evidence (to take our\nfirst example, the 75% ownership of blue buses) is not causally\nconnected with the fact sought to be proved and cannot guarantee the\ntruth of the relevant belief (that the bus which caused the accident\nwas blue) (Thomson 1986). An alternative argument is that knowledge\nrequires the ruling out of all relevant alternatives and, to take our\nprison scenario, there is no evidence that addresses the possibility\nthat the defendant was the one who refrained from joining in the\nattack or the possibility that the defendant is less likely to be\nguilty than an arbitrary prisoner in the yard. (See Moss forthcoming;\nMoss 2018: 213. Gardiner 2019a adapts the relevant alternatives\nframework to model legal standards of proof in a non-mathematical way\nwhile eschewing a knowledge account of those standards.) Another\npossible explanation for the failure to know relies on the notion of\nsensitivity. The belief that the defendant is liable is not sensitive\nto the truth where it is based on bare statistical evidence; in the\nbus example, evidence of the market share of buses remain the same\nwhether it is true or not that a blue bus caused the accident (cf.\nEnoch, Spectre, and Fisher 2012; Enoch and Fisher 2015; Enoch and\nSpectre 2019 \u2013 while suggesting that the lack of knowledge has\ngenerally to do with the insensitivity of the belief, the authors deny\nthat knowledge should matter to the imposition of legal liability).\nYet another explanation is that it is unsafe to find a person liable\non bare statistical evidence. Though safety is sometimes treated as a\ncondition of knowledge (in that knowledge requires a true belief that\nis safe), one can treat safety as a condition for finding the\ndefendant liable without also taking the position that the finding\nmust be based on knowledge of liability. Safety is commonly understood\nin terms of whether a belief formed on the same basis would be true in\nclose possible worlds. Roughly, a finding of liability is unsafe where\nit can easily be wrong in the sense that little in the actual world\nneeds to change for it to be wrong. Whether the requirement of safety\ncan explain why judgment should not entered against the defendant in\nour two hypothetical cases would depend on whether it can easily\nhappen that the accident-causing bus was red or that the accused is\ninnocent. (See Pritchard 2015 and 2018; Pardo 2018; cf. Gardiner\n2020.) While theorizing of standards of proof in epistemic terms has\ngathered pace in recent years, it is criticised for relying on\nunrealistic hypotheticals that fail to attend to the actual operation\nof legal systems and for making impossible epistemological demands\n(Allen 2020).\n\nThere is another paradox in the mathematical interpretation of the\nstandard of proof. This is the \u201cconjunction paradox\u201d. To\nsucceed in a civil claim (or a criminal prosecution), the plaintiff\n(or the prosecution) will have to prove the material facts\u2014or\n\u201celements\u201d\u2014that constitute the civil claim (or\ncriminal charge) that is before the court (see discussion of\n\u201cmateriality\u201d in\n section 2.2\n above). Imagine a claim under the law of negligence that rests on two\nelements: a breach of duty of care by the defendant (element\nA) and causation of harm to the plaintiff (element\nB). To win the case, the plaintiff is legally required to\nprove A and B. For the sake of simplicity, let\nA and B be mutually independent events. Suppose the\nevidence establishes A to a probability of 0.6 and B\nto a probability of 0.7. On the mathematical interpretation of the\ncivil standard of proof, the plaintiff should succeed in his claim\nsince the probability with respect to each of the elements exceeds\n0.5. However, according to the multiplication rule of conventional\nprobability calculus, the probability that A and B\nare both true is the product of their respective probabilities; in\nthis example, it is only 0.42 (obtained by multiplying 0.6 with 0.7).\nThus, the overall probability is greater that the defendant deserves\nto win than that the plaintiff deserves to win, and yet the verdict is\nawarded in favour of the plaintiff.\n\nOne way of avoiding the conjunction paradox is to take the position\nthat it should not be enough for each element to cross the\nprobabilistic threshold; the plaintiff (or the prosecution) should win\nonly if the probability of the plaintiff\u2019s (or\nprosecution\u2019s) case as a whole exceeds the applicable\nprobabilistic threshold. So, in our example, the plaintiff should lose\nsince the overall probability is below 0.5. But this suggested\nsolution is unsatisfactory. The required level of overall probability\nwould then turn on how many elements the civil claim or criminal\ncharge happens to have. The greater the number of elements, the higher\nthe level of probability to which, on average, each of them must be\nproved. This is thought to be arbitrary and hence objectionable. As\ntwo commentators noted, the legal definition of theft contains more\nelements than that for murder. Criminal law is not the same in all\ncountries. We may take the following as a convenient approximation of\nwhat the law is in some countries: murder is (1) an act that caused\nthe death of a person (2) that was done with the intention of causing\nthe death, and to constitute theft, there must be (1) an intention to\ntake property, (2) dishonesty in taking the property, (3) removal of\nthe property from the possession of another person, and (4) lack of\nconsent by that person. Since the offence of theft contains twice the\nnumber of elements as compared to murder, the individual elements for\ntheft would have to be proved to a much higher level of probability\n(in order for the probability of their conjunction to cross the\noverall threshold) than the individual elements for the much more\nserious crime of murder (Allen and Leiter 2001: 1504\u20135). This is\nintuitively unacceptable.\n\nAnother proposal for resolving the conjunction paradox is move away\nfrom thinking of the standard of proof as a quantified threshold of\nabsolute probability and to construe it, instead, as a probability\nratio. The fact-finder has to compare the probability of the evidence\nadduced at the trial under the plaintiff\u2019s theory of the case\nwith the probability of the evidence under the defendant\u2019s\ntheory of the case (the two need not add to 1), and award the verdict\nto the side with a higher probability (Cheng 2013). One criticism of\nthis interpretation of the standard of proof is that it ignores, and\ndoes not provide a basis for ignoring, the margin by which one\nprobability exceeds the other, and the difference in probability may\nvary significantly for different elements of the case (Allen and Stein\n2013: 598).\n\nThere is a deeper problem with the probabilistic conception of the\nstandard of proof. There does not seem to be a satisfactory\ninterpretation of probability that suits the forensic context. The\nonly plausible candidate is the subjective meaning of probability\naccording to which probability is construed as the strength of belief.\nThe evidence is sufficient to satisfy the legal standard of proof on a\ndisputed question of fact\u2014for example, it is sufficient to\njustify the positive finding of fact that the accused killed the\nvictim\u2014only if the fact-finder, having considered the evidence,\nforms a sufficiently strong belief that the accused killed the victim.\nGuidance on how to process evidence and form beliefs can be found in a\nmathematical theorem known as Bayes\u2019 theorem; it is the method\nby which an ideal rational fact-finder would revise or update his\nbeliefs in the light of new\n evidence.[19]\n To return to our earlier hypothetical scenario, suppose the\nfact-finder initially believes the odds of the accused being guilty is\n1:1 (\u201cprior odds\u201d) or, putting this differently, that\nthere is a 0.5 probability of guilt. The fact-finder then receives\nevidence that blood of type A was found at the scene of the crime and\nthat the accused has type A blood. Fifty percent of the population has\nthis blood type. On the Bayesian approach, the posterior odds are\ncalculated by multiplying the prior odds (1:1) by the likelihood ratio\n(which, as we saw in\n section 2.1.2\n above, is 2:1). The fact-finder\u2019s belief in the odds of guilt\nshould now be revised to 2:1; the probability of guilt is now\nincreased to 0.67 (Lempert 1977).\n\nThe subjectivist Bayesian theory of legal fact-finding has come under\nattack (see generally Amaya 2015: 82\u201393; Pardo 2013: 591).\nFirst, as we already saw in\n section 3.1,\n ascertainment of the likelihood ratios is highly problematic.\nSecondly, the Bayesian theory is not sensitive to the weight of\nevidence which, roughly put, is the amount of evidence that is\navailable. This criticism and the concept of weight are further\nexplored in\n section 3.3.\n\nThirdly, while the Bayesian theorem offers a method for updating\nprobabilities in the light of new evidence, it is silent on what the\ninitial probability should be. In a trial setting, the initial\nprobability cannot be set at zero since this means certainty in the\ninnocence of the accused. No new evidence can then make any\ndifference; whatever the likelihood ratio of the evidence, multiplying\nit by zero (the prior probability) will still end up with a posterior\nprobability of zero. On the other hand, starting with an initial\nprobability is also problematic. This is especially so in a criminal\ncase. To start a trial with some probability of guilt is to have the\nfact-finder harbouring some initial belief that the accused is guilty\nand this is not easy to reconcile with the presumption of innocence.\n(Tribe 1971: 1368\u20131372; cf. Posner 1999: 1514, suggesting\nstarting the trial with prior odds of 50:50, criticized by Friedman\n2000. The problem of fixing the prior probability is said to disappear\nif we base fact-finding simply on likelihood ratios: Sullivan, 2019:\n45\u201359.)\n\nFourthly, we have thus far relied for ease of illustration on highly\nsimplified\u2014and therefore unrealistic\u2014examples. In real\ncases, there are normally multiple and dependent items of evidence and\nthe probabilities of all possible conjunctions of these items, which\nare numerous, will have to be computed. These computations are far too\ncomplex to be undertaken by human beings (Callen 1982: 10\u201315).\nThe impossibility of complying with the Bayesian model undermines its\nprescriptive value.\n\nFifthly, according to Haack, the Bayesian theory has it the wrong way\nround. What matters is not the strength of the fact-finder\u2019s\nbelief itself. The standard of proof should be understood instead in\nterms of what it is reasonable for the fact-finder to believe in the\nlight of the evidence presented, and this is a matter of the degree to\nwhich the belief is warranted by the evidence. Evidence is legally\nsufficient where it warrants the contested factual claim to the degree\nrequired by law. Whether a factual claim is warranted by the evidence\nturns on how strongly the evidence supports the claim, on how\nindependently secure the evidence is, and on how much of the relevant\nevidence is available to the fact-finder (that is, the\ncomprehensiveness of the evidence\u2014see further discussion in\n section 3.3\n below). Haack is against identifying degrees of warrant with\nmathematical probabilities. Degrees of warrant do not conform to the\naxioms of the standard probability calculus. For instance, where the\nevidence is weak, neither p nor not-p may be\nwarranted; in contrast, the probability of p and the\nprobability of not-p must add up to 1. Further, where the\nprobability of p and the probability of q are both\nless than 1, the probability of p and q, being the\nproduct of the probability of p and the probability of\nq, is less than the probability of either. On the other hand,\nthe degree of warrant for the conjunction of p and q\nmay be higher than the warrant for\n either.[20]\n (See Haack 2004, 2008a,b, 2012, 2014 for the legal application of her\ngeneral theory of epistemology. For her general theory of\nepistemology, see Haack 1993: ch. 4; Haack 2009: ch. 4; Haack 2003:\nch. 3.)\n\nSixthly, research in experimental psychology suggests that\nfact-finders do not evaluate pieces of evidence one-by-one and in the\nunidirectional manner required under the mathematical model (Amaya\n2015: 114\u20135). A holistic approach is taken instead where the\ndiscrete items of evidence are integrated into large cognitive\nstructures (variously labelled as \u201cmental models\u201d,\n\u201cstories\u201d, \u201cnarratives\u201d and \u201ctheories of\nthe case\u201d), and they are assessed globally against the legal\ndefinition of the crime or civil claim that is in dispute (Pennington\nand Hastie 1991, 1993; Pardo 2000). The reasoning does not progress\nlinearly from evidence to a conclusion; it is bi-directional, going\nforward and backward: as the fact-finder\u2019s consideration of the\nevidence inclines him towards a particular verdict, his leaning\ntowards that conclusion will often produce a revision of his original\nperception and his assessment of the evidence (Simon 2004, 2011).\n\nThe holistic nature of evidential reasoning as revealed by these\nstudies has inspired alternative theories that are of a\nnon-mathematical nature. One alternative, already mentioned, is the\n\u201cexplanatory\u201d or \u201crelative plausibility\u201d\ntheory advanced by Allen together with Pardo and other collaborators\n(Allen 1986, 1991, 1994; Pardo 2000; Allen and Leiter 2001; Allen and\nJehl 2003; Pardo and Allen 2008; Allen and Pardo 2019; cf. Nance 2001,\nFriedman\n 2001).[21]\n They contend that fact-finders do not reason in the fashion portrayed\nby the Bayesian model. Instead, they engage in generating explanations\nor hypotheses on the available evidence by a process of abductive\nreasoning or drawing \u201cinferences to the best explanation\u201d,\nand these competing explanations or hypotheses are compared in the\nlight of the\n evidence.[22]\n The comparison is not of a hypothesis with the negation of that\nhypothesis, where the probability of a hypothesis is compared with the\nprobability of its negation. Instead, the comparison is of one\nhypothesis with one or more particular alternative hypotheses as\nadvocated by a party or as constructed by the fact-finder himself. On\nthis approach, the plausibility of X, the factual account of the case\nthat establishes the accused\u2019s guilt or defendant\u2019s\nliability, is compared with the plausibility of a hypothesis Y, a\nspecific alternative account that points to the accused\u2019s\ninnocence or the defendant\u2019s non-liability, and there may be\nmore than one such specific alternative account.\n\nOn this theory, the evidence is sufficient to satisfy the\npreponderance of proof standard when the best-available hypothesis\nthat explains the evidence and the underlying events include all of\nthe elements of the claim. Thus, in a negligence case, the\nbest-available hypothesis would have to include a breach of duty of\ncare by the plaintiff and causation of harm to the defendant as these\nare the elements that must be proved to succeed in the legal claim.\nFor the intermediate \u201cclear-and-convincing\u201d standard of\nproof, the best-available explanation must be substantially better\nthan the alternatives. To establish the standard of proof beyond\nreasonable doubt, there must be a plausible explanation of the\nevidence that includes all of the elements of the crime and, in\naddition, there must be no plausible explanation that is consistent\nwith innocence (Pardo and Allen 2008: 238\u2013240; Pardo 2013:\n603\u2013604).\n\nThe relative plausibility theory itself is perceived to have a number\nof\n shortcomings.[23]\n First, the theory portrays the assessment of plausibility as an\nexercise of judgment that involves employment of various criteria such\nas coherence, consistency, simplicity, consilience, and more. However,\nthe theory is sketchy on the meaning of plausibility and the criteria\nfor evaluating plausibility are left largely\n unanalyzed.[24]\n\nA second criticism of the relative plausibility theory is that,\ndespite the purported utilisation of \u201cinference to the best\nexplanation\u201d reasoning, the verdict is not controlled by the\nbest explanation. For instance, even if the prosecution\u2019s\nhypothesis is better than the defence\u2019s hypothesis, neither may\nbe very good. In these circumstances, the court must reject the\nprosecution\u2019s hypothesis even though it is the best of\nalternatives (Laudan 2007). One suggested mitigation of this criticism\nis to place some demand on the epistemic effort that the trier of fact\nmust take (for example, by being sufficiently diligent and thorough)\nin constructing the set of hypotheses from which the best is to be\nchosen (Amaya 2009: 155).\n\nThe third criticism is targeted at holistic theories of evidential\nreasoning in general and not specifically at the relative plausibility\ntheory. While it may be descriptively true that fact-finders decide\nverdicts by holistic evaluation of the plausibility of competing\nexplanations, hypotheses, narratives or factual theories that are\ngenerated from the evidence, such forms of reasoning may conceal bias\nand prejudice that stand greater chances of exposure under a\nsystematic approach such as Bayesian analysis (Twining 2006: 319;\nSimon 2004, 2011; Griffin 2013). A hypothesis constructed by the\nfact-finder may be shaped subconsciously by a prejudicial\ngeneralisation or background belief about the accused based on a\ncertain feature, say, his race or sexual history. Individuating this\nfeature and subjecting it to Bayesian scrutiny has the desirable\neffect of putting the generalisation or background belief under the\nspotlight and forcing the fact-finder to confront the problem of\nprejudice.\n3.3 The Weight of Evidence as the Degree of Evidential Completeness\n\nA third idea of evidential weight is prompted by this insight from\nKeynes (1921: 71):\n\n\nAs the relevant evidence at our disposal increases, the magnitude of\nthe probability of the argument may either decrease or increase,\naccording as the new knowledge strengthens the unfavourable or the\nfavourable evidence; but something seems to have increased in\neither case,\u2014we have a more substantial basis upon which to rest\nour conclusion. I express this by saying that an accession of new\nevidence increases the weight of an argument. New evidence\nwill sometimes decrease the probability of an argument, but it will\nalways increase its \u201cweight\u201d.\n\n\nThis idea of evidential weight has been applied by some legal scholars\nin assessing the sufficiency of evidence in satisfying legal standards\nof\n proof.[25]\n At its simplest, we may think of weight in the context of legal\nfact-finding as the amount of evidence before the court. Weight is\ndistinguishable from probability. The weight of evidence may be high\nand the mathematical probability low, as in the situation where the\nprosecution adduces a great deal of evidence tending to incriminate\nthe accused but the defence has an unshakeable alibi (Cohen 1986:\n641). Conversely, the state of evidence adduced in a case might\nestablish a sufficient degree of probability\u2014high enough to\ncross the supposed threshold of proof on the mathematical conception\nof the standard of proof\u2014and yet lack adequate weight. In the\nmuch-discussed gate-crasher\u2019s paradox, the only available\nevidence shows that the defendant was one of a thousand spectators at\na rodeo show and that only four hundred and ninety nine tickets were\nissued. The defendant is sued by the show organiser for gate-crashing.\nThe mathematical probability that the defendant was a gate-crasher is\n0.501 and this meets the probabilistic threshold for civil liability.\nBut, according to the negation principle of mathematical probability,\nthere is probability of 0.499 that the defendant did pay for his\nentrance. In these circumstances, it is intuitively unjust to find him\nliable (Cohen 1977: 75). A possible explanation for not finding him\nliable is that the evidence is too flimsy or of insufficient\nweight.\n\nProponents of the mathematical conception of the standard of proof\nhave stood their ground even while acknowledging that weight has a\nrole to play in the Bayesian analysis of probative value and the\nsufficiency of evidence. If a party does not produce relevant evidence\nthat is in his possession, resulting in the court facing an evidential\ndeficiency, it may draw an adverse inference against him when\ncomputing the posterior probability (Kaye 1986b: 667; Friedman 1997).\nOne criticism of this approach is that, in the absence of information\nabout the missing evidence, the drawing of the adverse inference is\nopen to the objection of arbitrariness (Nance 2008: 274). A further\nobjection is that the management of parties\u2019 conduct relating to\nevidence preservation and presentation should be left to judges and\nnot to the jury. What a judge may do to optimize evidential weight is\nto impose a burden of producing evidence on a party and to make the\nparty suffer an adverse finding of fact if he fails to produce the\nevidence. This will serve as an incentive for the party to act in a\nmanner that promotes the interest in evidential completeness (Nance\n2008, 2010, 2016).\n\nCohen suggests that the standard of proof should be conceived entirely\nas a matter of evidential weight which, on his theory, is a matter of\nthe number of tests or challenges to which a factual hypothesis is\nsubjected to in court. He offers an account of legal fact-finding in\nterms of an account of inductive probability that was inspired by the\nwork of writers such as Francis Bacon and J.S. Mill. Inductive\nprobability operates differently from the classical calculus of\nprobability. It is based on inductive support for the common-sense\ngeneralisation that licences the drawing of the relevant inference.\nInductive support for a generalisation is graded according to the\nnumber of tests that it has passed, or, putting this in another way,\nby the degree of its resistance to falsification by relevant\nvariables. The inductive probability of an argument is equal to the\nreliability grade of the inductive support for the generalisation\nwhich covers the argument.\n\nProof beyond reasonable doubt represents the maximum level of\ninductive probability. The prosecution may try to persuade the court\nto infer that the accused was guilty of burglary by producing evidence\nto establish that he was found in the vicinity of the victim\u2019s\nhouse late at night with the stolen object on him. This inference is\nlicensed by the generalisation that normally if a stranger is found\nimmediately after a burglary in possession of the stolen object, he\nintentionally removed it himself. The defence may try to defeat the\ninference by showing that the generalization does not apply in the\nparticular case, for example, by presenting evidence to show that the\naccused had found the object on the street. The prosecution\u2019s\nhypothesis is now challenged or put to the test. As a counter-move, it\nmay produce evidence to establish that the object could not have been\nlying in the street as alleged. If the generalisations on which the\nprosecution\u2019s case rest survive challenges by the defence at\nevery possible point, then guilt is proved beyond reasonable\n doubt.[26]\n The same reasoning structure applies in the civil context except that\nin a civil case, the plaintiff succeeds in proof on the preponderance\nof evidence so long as the conclusion to be proved by him is more\ninductively probable than its negation. (Cohen 1977, 1986; cf. Schum\n 1979.)[27]\n\nCohen\u2019s theory seems to require that each test to which a\nhypothesis is put can be unequivocally and objectively resolved. But\nusually this is not the case. In our example, we may not be entirely\nconvinced that the accused found or did not find the object on the\nstreet, and our evaluation would involve the exercise of judgment that\nis no less subjective as the sort of judgments required when applying\nthe standard probabilistic conception of proof (Nance 2008:\n275\u20136; Schum 1994: 261).\n", "bibliography": {"categories": [], "cat_ref_text": {"ref_list": ["Abimbola, A., 2001, \u201cAbductive Reasoning in Law: Taxonomy\nand Inference to the Best Explanation\u201d, <em>Cardozo Law\nReview</em>, 22: 1683\u20131689.", "Aitken, C., P.
