    "main_text": "Five Philosophical Themes || The Definition of Art\n3.1 The Definition of Art\n\nThe problem of defining art is by no means a problem for conceptual\nart alone. Two principal difficulties immediately arise in the context\nof any attempt to form a definition. First, the category of art is\nparticularly heterogeneous. Simply put, there seems to be an infinite\nvariety of things, or kinds of thing, that need to fall under its\njurisdiction. Second, there is great variety of opinion on what any\nputative definition of art should actually consist of.\n\nOn the standard conception, a definition is something that provides us\nwith necessary and sufficient conditions for some thing x to\nbe F, so that, for example, it is a necessary and sufficient condition\nfor a number to be an even number that it is (i) an integer and (ii)\ndivisible by two. Accordingly, a definition of art must be capable of\noutlining a clear set of conditions that must be satisfied.\n\nThere have been no shortages of attempts to define art in this manner.\nMost prominently perhaps, it has been suggested that art ought to be\ndefined in terms of its aesthetic character, so that, roughly,\nx is an artwork if and only if x gives rise to an\naesthetic experience (e.g., Beardsley 1958). Notwithstanding the\ndifficulties that this particular suggestion entails (we shall return\nto this in \u00a73.3), the advent of a kind of art that is as\nprofoundly revisionary and difficult to classify as conceptual art\nrenders the attempt to provide a general definition applicable to\nall art particularly complex. It is no coincidence, then,\nthat a neo-Wittgensteinian approach came to dominate the philosophy of\nart in the late 1950s and 1960s. Drawing support from\nanti-essentialist theories of language, it was suggested that art was\nnumbered among the various concepts that are, by their very nature,\n\u2018essentially contested\u2019 (Gallie 1948; see also Weitz\n1956). That is to say, some concepts \u2013 such as that pertaining\nto sports, for example\u2013 simply do not allow for definitions in\nterms of necessary and sufficient conditions, and art is best as\nunderstood as one of them. In the words of Morris Weitz, art may\nbe\n\nan open concept. New conditions have constantly arisen and will\nundoubtedly constantly arise; new art forms, new movements will\nemerge, which will demand decisions on the part of those\ninterested\u2026 as to whether the concept should be extended or\nnot. (Weitz 1956, 32)\n\n\nThe act of proposing a definition of art thus becomes a less stringent\nexercise of conceptual analysis. The alternative method proposed by\nneo-Wittgensteinians such as Weitz in attempting to identify art and\nexplain how we are to distinguish it from non-art is the notion of\nfamily resemblance (see Wittgenstein 1953,\n\u00a766\u201371). Faced with the question \u2018Is X an\nartwork?\u2019, what we should do is try to detect strands of\nresemblance with paradigmatic instances of an artwork. If some\nsignificant resemblance to such a paradigmatic case is observed, we\ncan rightly call the object of our scrutiny a work of art.\n\nThe proposal, though interesting, is not without its own difficulties.\nOne problem that immediately arises relates to the idea of resemblance\nitself, and the way it rapidly expands in such a way as to render it\nclose to useless. This is for the simple reason that we can always\nfind some way in which some given thing may be said to resemble any\nother given thing. This kind of openness, it is important to note, is\nnot something that fits in with the programme of conceptual\nart. Whilst conceptual art does hold that any kind of object could be\na work of art, it is not saying that every object is a work\nof art. Far from it. Much conceptual art, in exploring the boundaries\nbetween the realms of the artistic and that of function and utility,\nis perceptually indistinguishable from non-art, such as Andy\nWarhol\u2019s Brillo Boxes. In that sense, conceptual art\npresents a particularly difficult case for the neo-Wittgensteinian\nmethod of identification. After all, the only way in which\nWarhol\u2019s Brillo Boxes does not resemble any other stack\nof Brillo Boxes is the sense in which the former is a work of art and\nthe latter is not. The notion of resemblance is clearly of little use\nhere.\n\nPicking up on this concern, Arthur Danto has famously suggested that\nit is in fact a non-manifest relation that makes something an artwork\nrather than an observable property (Danto 1981). That is to say,\nartworks acquire that status in virtue of their relations to the\nhistorical and social setting constituted by the practices and\nconventions of art, our artistic heritage, the intentions of artists,\nand so on \u2014 the \u2018artworld\u2019 (see also Dickie\n1974). The general idea here is that artworks are generated within a\nsocial and artistic context, and so being an artwork is a function of\ncertain social relations. Conceptual art reinforces the idea that art\nand non-art can be perceptually indistinguishable and so cannot be\nmarked off from each other by \u2018exhibited\u2019 properties\n alone.[5]\n\nSetting aside the details of such an account, one of the things\nconceptual art has helped philosophers to grasp more fully is that any\nsuccessful general definition, or indeed principled theory of the\nidentification of art, will need to have the non-manifest properties\nof artworks at its centre. It is the meaning that the artist infuses\ninto the work and the meaning that we as audience stand to gain from\nit that contains the key to its status as art (more on this in\n\u00a73.4). To use the example of Warhol\u2019s Brillo Boxes\nagain, the work of the conceptual artist seems primarily to be the\nwork of imbuing objects with a particular kind of meaning.\n\nA more promising line of enquiry has been developed by David Davies.\nTaking his cue from the problems posed by conceptual art, Davies\nargues that a unified definition of art can only be found if we think\nof art primarily in terms of the creative process or series of actions\nresulting in a material thing or other \u2018focus of\nappreciation\u2019. In that sense, the artwork is primarily\nidentified with the intentional acts through which it comes into being\nrather than with the end-product of that process (Davies 2004). Art,\non this view, is better understood as a kind of performance than as a\nmanifest object. By shifting the focus of our attention in this way,\nwe can overcome many of the difficulties associated with defining art,\nmost notably that of its heterogeneity. It may be, then, that the most\nenduring lesson to be learnt from conceptual art with regards to the\ndefinition of art is not so much that a conceptual analysis of art is\ncompletely unattainable, as that we simply have been looking in the\nwrong place.\n",
