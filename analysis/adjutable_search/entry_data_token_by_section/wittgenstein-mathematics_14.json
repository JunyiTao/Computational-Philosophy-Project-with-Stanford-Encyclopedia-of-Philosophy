    "main_text": "The Later Wittgenstein on Mathematics: Some Preliminaries || Wittgenstein on G\u00f6del and Undecidable Mathematical Propositions\n3.6 Wittgenstein on G\u00f6del and Undecidable Mathematical Propositions\n\nRFM is perhaps most (in)famous for Wittgenstein\u2019s\n(RFM App. III) treatment of \u201ctrue but unprovable\u201d\nmathematical propositions. Early reviewers said that \u201c[t]he\narguments are wild\u201d (Kreisel 1958: 153), that the passages\n\u201con G\u00f6del\u2019s theorem\u2026 are of poor quality or\ncontain definite errors\u201d (Dummett 1959: 324), and that\n(RFM App. III) \u201cthrows no light on G\u00f6del\u2019s\nwork\u201d (Goodstein 1957: 551). \u201cWittgenstein seems to want\nto legislate [[q]uestions about completeness] out of\nexistence\u201d, Anderson said, (1958: 486\u201387) when, in fact,\nhe certainly cannot dispose of G\u00f6del\u2019s demonstrations\n\u201cby confusing truth with provability\u201d. Additionally,\nBernays, Anderson (1958: 486), and Kreisel (1958: 153\u201354)\nclaimed that Wittgenstein failed to appreciate\n\u201cG\u00f6del\u2019s quite explicit premiss of the consistency of\nthe considered formal system\u201d (Bernays 1959: 15), thereby\nfailing to appreciate the conditional nature of G\u00f6del\u2019s\nFirst Incompleteness Theorem. On the reading of these four early\nexpert reviewers, Wittgenstein failed to understand G\u00f6del\u2019s\nTheorem because he failed to understand the mechanics of\nG\u00f6del\u2019s proof and he erroneously thought he could refute or\nundermine G\u00f6del\u2019s proof simply by identifying \u201ctrue\nin PM\u201d (i.e., Principia Mathematica) with\n\u201cproved/provable in PM\u201d.\n\nInterestingly, we now have two pieces of evidence (Kreisel 1998: 119;\nRodych 2003: 282, 307) that Wittgenstein wrote (RFM App. III)\nin 1937\u201338 after reading only the informal,\n\u2018casual\u2019 (MS 126, 126\u2013127; Dec. 13, 1942)\nintroduction of (G\u00f6del 1931) and that, therefore, his use of a\nself-referential proposition as the \u201ctrue but unprovable\nproposition\u201d may be based on G\u00f6del\u2019s introductory,\ninformal statements, namely that \u201cthe undecidable proposition\n[\\(R(q);q\\)] states\u2026 that [\\(R(q);q\\)] is not provable\u201d\n(1931: 598) and that \u201c[\\(R(q);q\\)] says about itself that it is\nnot provable\u201d (1931: 599). Perplexingly, only two of the four\nfamous reviewers even mentioned Wittgenstein\u2019s (RFM\nVII, \u00a7\u00a719, 21\u201322, 1941)) explicit remarks on\n\u2018G\u00f6del\u2019s\u2019 First Incompleteness Theorem (Bernays\n1959: 2; Anderson 1958: 487), which, though flawed, capture the\nnumber-theoretic nature of the G\u00f6delian proposition and\nthe functioning of G\u00f6del-numbering, probably because Wittgenstein\nhad by then read or skimmed the body of G\u00f6del\u2019s 1931 paper.\n\nThe first thing to note, therefore, about (RFM App. III) is\nthat Wittgenstein mistakenly thinks\u2014again, perhaps because\nWittgenstein had read only G\u00f6del\u2019s Introduction\u2014(a)\nthat G\u00f6del proves that there are true but unprovable propositions\nof PM (when, in fact, G\u00f6del syntactically proves that if\nPM is \\(\\omega\\)-consistent, the G\u00f6delian proposition is\nundecidable in PM) and (b) that G\u00f6del\u2019s proof uses\na self-referential proposition to semantically show that there are\ntrue but unprovable propositions of PM.\n\nFor this reason, Wittgenstein has two main aims in (RFM App.\nIII): (1) to refute or undermine, on its own terms, the\nalleged G\u00f6del proof of true but unprovable propositions of\nPM, and (2) to show that, on his own terms, where \u201ctrue\nin calculus \\(\\Gamma\\)\u201d is identified with\n\u201cproved in calculus \\(\\Gamma\\)\u201d, the very idea of\na true but unprovable proposition of calculus \\(\\Gamma\\) is\nmeaningless.\n\nThus, at (RFM App. III, \u00a78) (hereafter simply\n\u2018\u00a78\u2019), Wittgenstein begins his presentation of what\nhe takes to be G\u00f6del\u2019s proof by having someone say: \n\n\nI have constructed a proposition (I will use \u2018P\u2019 to\ndesignate it) in Russell\u2019s symbolism, and by means of certain\ndefinitions and transformations it can be so interpreted that it says:\n\u2018P is not provable in Russell\u2019s system\u2019. \n\n\nThat is, Wittgenstein\u2019s G\u00f6delian constructs a proposition\nthat is semantically self-referential and which specifically\nsays of itself that it is not provable in PM. With this\nerroneous, self-referential proposition P [used also at\n(\u00a710), (\u00a711), (\u00a717), (\u00a718)], Wittgenstein presents\na proof-sketch very similar to G\u00f6del\u2019s own\ninformal semantic proof \u2018sketch\u2019 in the\nIntroduction of his famous paper (1931: 598).\n\n\nMust I not say that this proposition on the one hand is true, and on\nthe other hand is unprovable? For suppose it were false; then it is\ntrue that it is provable. And that surely cannot be! And if it is\nproved, then it is proved that it is not provable. Thus it can only be\ntrue, but unprovable. (\u00a78)\n\n\nThe reasoning here is a double reductio. Assume (a) that\nP must either be true or false in Russell\u2019s system, and (b)\nthat P must either be provable or unprovable in Russell\u2019s\nsystem. If (a), P must be true, for if we suppose that\nP is false, since P says of itself that it is unprovable,\n\u201cit is true that it is provable\u201d, and if it is provable,\nit must be true (which is a contradiction), and hence, given what\nP means or says, it is true that P is unprovable (which is a\ncontradiction). Second, if (b), P must be unprovable, for if P\n\u201cis proved, then it is proved that it is not provable\u201d,\nwhich is a contradiction (i.e., P is provable and not\nprovable in PM). It follows that P \u201ccan only be\ntrue, but unprovable\u201d.\n\nTo refute or undermine this \u2018proof\u2019, Wittgenstein says\nthat if you have proved \\(\\neg P\\), you have proved that P is\nprovable (i.e., since you have proved that it is not the case\nthat P is not provable in Russell\u2019s system), and \u201cyou\nwill now presumably give up the interpretation that it is\nunprovable\u201d (i.e., \u2018P is not provable in\nRussell\u2019s system\u2019), since the contradiction is only proved\nif we use or retain this self-referential interpretation (\u00a78). On\nthe other hand, Wittgenstein argues (\u00a78), \u2018[i]f you assume\nthat the proposition is provable in Russell\u2019s system, that means\nit is true in the Russell sense, and the interpretation\n\u201cP is not provable\u201d again has to be given up\u2019,\nbecause, once again, it is only the self-referential interpretation\nthat engenders a contradiction. Thus, Wittgenstein\u2019s\n\u2018refutation\u2019 of \u201cG\u00f6del\u2019s proof\u201d\nconsists in showing that no contradiction arises if we do not\ninterpret \u2018P\u2019 as \u2018P is not provable in\nRussell\u2019s system\u2019\u2014indeed, without this\ninterpretation, a proof of P does not yield a proof of \\(\\neg P\\)\nand a proof of \\(\\neg P\\) does not yield a proof of P. In other\nwords, the mistake in the proof is the mistaken assumption that a\nmathematical proposition \u2018P\u2019 \u201ccan be so\ninterpreted that it says: \u2018P is not provable in\nRussell\u2019s system\u2019\u201d. As Wittgenstein says at\n(\u00a711), \u201c[t]hat is what comes of making up such\nsentences\u201d.\n\nThis \u2018refutation\u2019 of \u201cG\u00f6del\u2019s\nproof\u201d is perfectly consistent with Wittgenstein\u2019s\nsyntactical conception of mathematics (i.e., wherein mathematical\npropositions have no meaning and hence cannot have the\n\u2018requisite\u2019 self-referential meaning) and with what he\nsays before and after (\u00a78), where his main aim is to show (2)\nthat, on his own terms, since \u201ctrue in calculus\n\\(\\Gamma\\)\u201d is identical with \u201cproved in calculus\n\\(\\Gamma\\)\u201d, the very idea of a true but unprovable proposition\nof calculus \\(\\Gamma\\) is a contradiction-in-terms.\n\nTo show (2), Wittgenstein begins by asking (\u00a75), what he takes to\nbe, the central question, namely, \u201cAre there true propositions\nin Russell\u2019s system, which cannot be proved in his\nsystem?\u201d. To address this question, he asks \u201cWhat is\ncalled a true proposition in Russell\u2019s system\u2026?\u201d,\nwhich he succinctly answers (\u00a76): \u201c\u2018p\u2019\nis true = p\u201d. Wittgenstein then clarifies this answer\nby reformulating the second question of (\u00a75) as \u201cUnder what\ncircumstances is a proposition asserted in Russell\u2019s game [i.e.,\nsystem]?\u201d, which he then answers by saying: \u201cthe answer\nis: at the end of one of his proofs, or as a \u2018fundamental\nlaw\u2019 (Pp.)\u201d (\u00a76). This, in a nutshell, is\nWittgenstein\u2019s conception of \u201cmathematical truth\u201d: a\ntrue proposition of PM is an axiom or a proved proposition,\nwhich means that \u201ctrue in PM\u201d is identical with,\nand therefore can be supplanted by, \u201cproved in\nPM\u201d.\n\nHaving explicated, to his satisfaction at least, the only real,\nnon-illusory notion of \u201ctrue in PM\u201d, Wittgenstein\nanswers the (\u00a78) question \u201cMust I not say that this\nproposition\u2026 is true, and\u2026 unprovable?\u201d\nnegatively by (re)stating his own (\u00a7\u00a75\u20136)\nconception of \u201ctrue in PM\u201d as\n\u201cproved/provable in PM\u201d: \n\n\n\u2018True in Russell\u2019s system\u2019 means, as was said:\nproved in Russell\u2019s system; and \u2018false in Russell\u2019s\nsystem\u2019 means: the opposite has been proved in Russell\u2019s\nsystem. \n\n\nThis answer is given in a slightly different way at (\u00a77) where\nWittgenstein asks \u201cmay there not be true propositions which are\nwritten in this [Russell\u2019s] symbolism, but are not provable in\nRussell\u2019s system?\u201d, and then answers \u201c\u2018True\npropositions\u2019, hence propositions which are true in\nanother system, i.e. can rightly be asserted in another\ngame\u201d. In light of what he says in (\u00a7\u00a75, 6, and 8),\nWittgenstein\u2019s (\u00a77) point is that if a proposition is\n\u2018written\u2019 in \u201cRussell\u2019s symbolism\u201d and\nit is true, it must be proved/provable in another system,\nsince that is what \u201cmathematical truth\u201d is. Analogously\n(\u00a78), \u201cif the proposition is supposed to be false in some\nother than the Russell sense, then it does not contradict this for it\nto be proved in Russell\u2019s sense\u201d, for \u201c[w]hat is\ncalled \u2018losing\u2019 in chess may constitute winning in another\ngame\u201d. This textual evidence certainly suggests, as Anderson\nalmost said, that Wittgenstein rejects a true but unprovable\nmathematical proposition as a contradiction-in-terms on the grounds\nthat \u201ctrue in calculus \\(\\Gamma\\)\u201d means nothing more (and\nnothing less) than \u201cproved in calculus \\(\\Gamma\\)\u201d.\n\nOn this (natural) interpretation of (RFM App. III), the early\nreviewers\u2019 conclusion that Wittgenstein fails to understand the\nmechanics of G\u00f6del\u2019s argument seems reasonable. First,\nWittgenstein erroneously thinks that G\u00f6del\u2019s proof is\nessentially semantical and that it uses and requires a\nself-referential proposition. Second, Wittgenstein says (\u00a714)\nthat \u201c[a] contradiction is unusable\u201d for \u201ca\nprediction\u201d that \u201cthat such-and-such construction is\nimpossible\u201d (i.e., that P is unprovable in PM),\nwhich, superficially at least, seems to\nindicate that Wittgenstein fails to appreciate the \u201cconsistency\nassumption\u201d of G\u00f6del\u2019s proof (Kreisel, Bernays,\nAnderson).\n\nIf, in fact, Wittgenstein did not read and/or failed to understand\nG\u00f6del\u2019s proof through at least 1941, how would he have\nresponded if and when he understood it as (at least) a proof of the\nundecidability of P in PM on the assumption of\nPM\u2019s consistency? Given his syntactical conception of\nmathematics, even with the extra-mathematical application criterion,\nhe would simply say that P, qua expression syntactically\nindependent of PM, is not a proposition of PM, and\nif it is syntactically independent of all existent mathematical\nlanguage-games, it is not a mathematical proposition. Moreover, there\nseem to be no compelling non-semantical reasons\u2014either\nintra-systemic or extra-mathematical\u2014for Wittgenstein to\naccommodate P by including it in PM or by adopting a\nnon-syntactical conception of mathematical truth (such as Tarski-truth\n(Steiner 2000)). Indeed, Wittgenstein questions the intra-systemic and\nextra-mathematical usability of P in various discussions\nof G\u00f6del in the Nachlass and, at\n(\u00a719), he emphatically says that one cannot \u201cmake the truth\nof the assertion [\u2018P\u2019 or \u2018Therefore\nP\u2019] plausible to me, since you can make no use of it except\nto do these bits of legerdemain\u201d.\n\nAfter the initial, scathing reviews of RFM, very little\nattention was paid to Wittgenstein\u2019s (RFM App. III and\nRFM VII, \u00a7\u00a721\u201322) discussions of\nG\u00f6del\u2019s First Incompleteness Theorem (Klenk 1976: 13) until\nShanker\u2019s sympathetic (1988b). In the last 22 years, however,\ncommentators and critics have offered various interpretations of\nWittgenstein\u2019s remarks on G\u00f6del, some being largely\nsympathetic (Floyd 1995, 2001) and others offering a more mixed\nappraisal (Rodych 1999a, 2002, 2003; Steiner 2001; Priest 2004; Berto\n2009a). Recently, and perhaps most interestingly, Floyd & Putnam\n(2000) and Steiner (2001) have evoked new and interesting discussions\nof Wittgenstein\u2019s ruminations on undecidability, mathematical\ntruth, and G\u00f6del\u2019s First Incompleteness Theorem (Rodych\n2003, 2006; Bays 2004; Sayward 2005; and Floyd & Putnam 2006).\n",
