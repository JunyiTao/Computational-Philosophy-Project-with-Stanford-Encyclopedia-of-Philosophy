    "main_text": "\n1. Introduction\n\nAs a number of philosophers have remarked, one of the many puzzles\nabout identity, given its apparent simplicity, is why it proves so\npuzzling. Indeed, one pervasive sentiment is that identity cannot pose\nany philosophical problems. Anything that looks like a problem about\nidentity must really be a problem about something else. David Lewis\ngives striking expression to this sentiment when he says:\n\nMore important, we should not suppose that we have here any problem\nabout identity. We never have. Identity is utterly simple and\nunproblematic. Everything is identical to itself; nothing is ever\nidentical to anything except itself. There is never any problem about\nwhat makes something identical to itself; nothing can ever fail to be.\n(Lewis 1986, 192\u2013193)\n\n\nDespite that, problems about identity appear to play a central role in\na large number of philosophical issues whose discussion dates back to\nthe ancient world. One of the most venerable concerns identity and\nchange. Things change, but remain the same. The same poker is at one\ntime hot, another time cold. How can something be both identical and\ndifferent from one time to another? At first sight this problem\nevaporates once we draw the time honored distinction between numerical\nand qualitative identity. To say that a and b are\nqualitatively identical is to say that a exactly resembles\nb. To say that a and b are numerically\nidentical is, at least, to say a and b are one thing\nand not two. Whether a and b can have all\ntheir qualities in common without being numerically identical is\ncontroversial. Nevertheless, it seems that a and b\ncan be numerically identical without being qualitatively identical by\nhaving different qualities at different times.\n\nSome find problematic the very same thing having different properties\nat different times (see the problem of temporary intrinsics discussed\nbelow). Setting that general problem aside, there are special cases of\nit that generate some of the most intractable issues about identity.\nOne results from persisting things putatively having different parts\nat different times. Consider an object capable of changing its parts,\nsuch as a cup at a time when its handle is still attached. At that\ntime the cup appears to consist of the following two parts: a smaller\none, its handle, together with a larger one consisting of the rest of\nthe cup. Call the larger of these parts the truncated cup. The cup,\notherwise unscathed, proceeds to lose its handle. At the earlier time,\nwith its handle still intact, the cup is surely distinct from the\ntruncated cup. Later, after the removal of the cup's handle, the cup\nspatially coincides with the truncated cup. Each object is, at the\nlater time, composed from exactly the same atoms. As one philosopher\nhas put it about a different example, at the later time the cup and\nthe truncated cup are as alike as one pea in a pod (Denis Robinson, in\nconversation). Should we say that the cup and truncated cup are\nearlier distinct, but later identical? The problem is that saying so\narguably conflicts with a fundamental principle governing identity\ncalled Leibniz's Law.\n\nIdentity looms large in Leibniz's philosophy. He is responsible for\narticulating two principles that, he claims, are constitutive of\nidentity. The first, more controversial, of these, called the identity\nof indiscernibles, says that qualitative indiscernibility implies\nidentity. The second, often referred to as Leibniz's Law or the\nIndiscernibility of Identicals, says that identity implies qualitative\nindiscernibility. According to Leibniz's Law, if a is\nidentical with b, every quality of a will be a\nquality of b. (See the entry on\n identity of indiscernibles.)\n\nHere are two ways in which, it seems, saying that the cup is earlier\ndistinct from, but later identical with, the truncated cup conflicts\nwith Leibniz's Law. Ostensibly one of the cup's later properties is\nhaving earlier had a handle. That is the property the truncated cup\nnever has. So, identifying the later cup and truncated cup appears to\nviolate Leibniz's Law. There is, at least, one property, having\nformerly had a handle, that the cup and truncated cup never have in\ncommon.\n\nHere is a second way in which the claim that the cup and truncated cup\nare sometimes, but not always, identical appears to violate Leibniz's\nLaw. Let us bestow a name on the cup. Call it \u2018Cup\u2019. Let\nus also call the truncated cup \u2018Tcup\u2019. We are envisaging\nthat Cup is sometimes, but not always, identical with Tcup. Leibniz's\nLaw tells us that Cup and Tcup share all their properties at any time\nthey are identical. Some properties are commonly referred to as modal\nproperties. A modal property is the property of possibly or\nnecessarily having some further property. Modal properties include\nsuch properties as being possibly red, necessarily extended, possibly\ntaller than a giraffe, or necessarily cup shaped. Arguably one of\nCup's modal properties is the property of being necessarily identical\nwith Cup. Suppose Cup and Tcup are at some time identical. In that\ncase, by Leibniz's Law, Tcup will, at some time, share with Cup the\nmodal property of being necessarily identical with Cup. So, if Cup is\never identical with Tcup, then Tcup has the modal property of being\nnecessarily identical with Cup. But if Tcup is necessarily identical\nwith Cup, there can be no time when Tcup is distinct from Cup.\n\nLet us say that the identity of a with b is\ntemporary if a is sometimes, but not always, identical with\nb. Later we shall look at other types of puzzle cases that\nprovide some motivation for countenancing temporary identity. Despite\nthe existence of such cases the majority of philosophers are\nreluctant, principally because of the putative conflict with Leibniz's\nLaw, to allow temporary identity. Instead, to deal with puzzles about\nidentity through time a wide range of alternatives have been proposed.\nThese include: maintaining that Cup is later constituted by Tcup\n(where constitution does not imply identity); denying that Tcup is\nearlier a proper part of Cup; maintaining that Cup and Tcup are never\nidentical, but only share a later temporal part in common; holding\nthat the identity between the earlier Tcup and later Cup is not\nliteral, but only loose and popular.\n\nBy synchronic identity we mean an identity holding at a single time.\nBy diachronic identity we mean an identity holding between something\nexisting at one time and something existing at another. One question\nis whether synchronic and diachronic identity are different kinds of\nidentity. Some philosophers are willing to countenance different kinds\nof identity. Others are reluctant to do so. One philosopher who is\nwilling to postulate a multiplicity of different kinds of identity is\nPeter Geach. Geach, among others, has addressed puzzles about both\nsynchronic and diachronic identity by denying that there is a single\nabsolute relation of identity rather than a host of relative identity\nrelations. On this view we cannot simply say that a is\nidentical with b. Instead there must be a concept of a kind\nof thing, a so called sortal concept, that serves to answer the\nquestion: a is the same what as b? This is\nso, according to the champions of relative identity, because the\nfollowing can happen: a and b both fall under the\nsortal concepts F and G, a is the same\nF as b, but a is not the same G as\nb (Geach 1967, and see the entry on\n relative identity).\n\nConsider the case of Cup and Tcup. Is Cup at the later time\nt\u2032 identical with Tcup? Is Tcup at t\u2032\nidentical with Tcup at t? A relative identity theorist would\ndeny that these questions have answers. For such a theorist to have an\nanswerable question we would need to replace, for example, the first\nwith: At t\u2032 is Cup the same cup as Tcup?\n\nHow could insisting on the relativity of the answer to an identity\nquestion to a kind help with the diachronic identity puzzle posed by\nCup and Tcup? Here is one way that it could. Suppose that nothing is a\ncup when it is a proper part of a cup. Then Tcup fails to qualify as a\ncup at t when it is a proper part of Cup. In that case a relative\nidentity theorist can say the following. At the later time\nt\u2032 Cup is the same cup as Tcup. Since Tcup is not a cup\nat the earlier time t, neither Cup not Tcup at\nt\u2032 is the same cup as Tcup at t. Moreover, for\nany kind K, Cup is not the same K as Tcup at\nt. Identifying Cup with Tcup as the same cup at\nt\u2032 places us under no constraint to identify Cup with\none of its proper parts, Tcup, at t.\n\nSome of those who reject relative identity nevertheless accept that\na cannot be identical with b, unless there is a more\nspecific answer to the question whether a is the same\nthing as b. Many philosophers distinguish between\ntwo kinds of concepts which are applicable to whatever can persist\nthrough time. One kind is illustrated by the concepts of gold (as\nopposed to a quantity or piece of gold), snow, or rain. In the case of\nany such concept F, there is no answer to the question: how\nmany Fs are there? In contrast, in the case of other concepts\nsuch as the concept of a horse, a tall person, an artwork, or a statue\nthere is an answer to the question: how many Fs are there?\nFor example, though we may not know it, there is an answer to the\nquestion: how many statues are there? Concepts of this last kind are\noften referred to as sortal concepts. Those who take the view that the\nquestion whether a is the same as b is illegitimate,\nunless it is construed as elliptical for the question whether\na is the same thing of such and such a kind as b\ntypically also hold the following views. We should distinguish between\ntwo types of sortal concepts: phase and substance sortals. A phase\nsortal such as child, utensil or prize is a concept that something can\ncease to fall under without ceasing to exist. If, in contrast,\nsomething falls under a substance sortal, it must always do so. If\na at some time t is the same as b at the\nsame, or a different time t\u2032, it must, say advocates of\nthe view in question, be that, for some sortal S, a\nat t is the same S as b at\nt\u2032. For example, if John's favorite artwork at\nt is identical with Sally's most valuable possession at\nt\u2032, there must be a substance sortal, the concept of a\nstatue as it may be, under which John's favorite artwork at\nt, and Sally's most valuable possession at t\u2032\nboth fall. Moreover, a substance sortal is said to go together with a\ncriterion of identity where a criterion of identity associated with\nsubstance sortal S is, inter alia, a criterion for some\nearlier S being the same S as some later\nS.\n\nFinally, there are a group of issues that fall under the heading of\nthe dispensability of identity. According to one tradition that goes\nback, at least, to Wittgenstein's Tractatus, we can\ntheoretically dispense with identity talk without loss of information.\nSome, but by no means all, who take this view, do so because they hold\nthat the predicate \u2018is identical with\u2019 corresponds to no\ngenuine property. Issues about the dispensability of identity engage\nwith issues about identity across time in the following way. This\nsection opened with a quote from David Lewis claiming that there is\nnever any philosophical problem about identity. The case of Cup and\nTcup raises what is ostensibly a problem about identity across time.\nThat problem only arises, it seems, because the later Cup is\nputatively identical with the earlier Tcup. If the problem is not, in\npart, about that putative identity holding, what is it about?\n\nAccording to a four dimensionalist like David Lewis a table is\nextended through the time of its life, and constituted from temporal\nparts which are themselves short lived tables. As such a four\ndimensionalist like Lewis would not hesitate to give the following\nanswer to the above question. The problem is, in part, a problem about\nwhether a cup-like object that exists only at t\u2032 is\nsuitably related to a cup-like object, itself a proper part of a\nlarger cup-like object, that exists only at t so that both\ncup-like objects are temporal stages or parts of a four-dimensionally\nextended cup.\n\nIf we are not prepared to endorse four dimensionalism, it remains to\nbe seen how the putative problem about Cup and Tcup's identity through\ntime can be reformulated so that it is no longer a problem about\nidentity through time.\n2. Identity and Change\n2.1 Diachronic and Synchronic Identity\n\nIt is customary to distinguish identity at a time from identity across\ntime. An example of an identity holding at a single time is: the table\nin the next room is (now) identical with my favorite table. An example\nof an identity holding across different times is: The table in the\nnext room is identical with the one you purchased last year.\nDiachronic identities pose some of the most intractable problems about\nidentity. Before looking at those problems, and some of the most\nfrequently proposed solutions to them, let us ask whether there is\nanything that distinguishes identity from other relations.\n\nThe most commonly agreed on distinguishing feature of identity is that\nit conforms to the Indiscernibility of Identicals, what was earlier\ncalled Leibniz's Law. Taking \u2018\u2200F\u2019 to be a\nquantifier ranging over properties, here is one way to formulate\nLeibniz's Law:\n\nLL: \u2200x\u2200y[x=y \u2192\n\u2200F(Fx \u2192 Fy)]\n\n\nLL, understood to range over identity properties, if any, such as\nbeing identical with a, says that if x is identical with\ny, then any property of x is a property of\ny. \n2.2 Identity as an Equivalence Relation\n\nA relation R is reflexive if each thing stands in R\nto itself. It is symmetrical if a's standing in R to\nb implies that b stands in R to a.\nIt is transitive if a's standing in R to b\nand b's likewise standing in R to c\ntogether imply that a stands in R to c.\nIdentity is trivially reflexive. Each thing trivially stands in the\nrelation of identity to itself. That identity is also symmetrical and\ntransitive follows from Leibniz's Law. Suppose identity fails to be\nsymmetrical, and for some a and b, a is\nidentical with b, but b is not identical with\na. In that case, a has a property, being identical\nwith b, which b fails to have. Suppose identity is\nnot transitive, and, for some a, b and c,\na is identical with b and b is identical\nwith c, but a is not identical with c. In\nthat case b has a property, being identical with c,\nthat a lacks.\n2.3 Leibniz's Law and the Possibility of Change: The Problem of Temporary Intrinsics\n\nIdentity through time generates a number of problems posed by puzzle\ncases such as the case of Cup and Tcup. Later we will review a number\nof solutions to those problems offered in the literature. One problem\nabout identity through time is not raised by consideration of puzzle\ncases. It arises simply because persisting things can change their\nintrinsic properties. For that reason it has been labeled by David\nLewis the problem of temporary intrinsics (Lewis 1986,\n202\u2013205).\n\nA decent test for distinguishing between extrinsic and intrinsic\nproperties is this. A property F is an extrinsic property of\nan object o if o having F implies that\nsomething distinct from, and not a proper part of, o exists.\nFor example, being married to Sally is an extrinsic property of John's\nsince John can only have that property if something, Sally, distinct\nfrom, and not a proper part, of him exists. A property F is\nan intrinsic property of o if and only if o having\nF is compatible with nothing apart from o and its\nproper parts existing, and also compatible with something apart from\no existing. For example, the property of being round is an\nintrinsic property because a surface S having that property\nis compatible with nothing other than S and its proper parts\nexisting. Here is one reason why this is only a rough way of drawing\nthe distinction between intrinsic and extrinsic properties. It looks\nas though the property of existing in complete isolation, which Lewis\ncalls loneliness, is extrinsic. Nevertheless being, in this sense,\nlonely is not only compatible with, but requires that nothing else\nexists. (For more discussion, see the entry on\n intrinsic vs. extrinsic properties.)\n \n\nSuppose some object, a metal plate we will call Plate, changes from\nbeing round at t1 to being square at\nt2. How can that be? After all, though something\ncan have a round part and a square part, nothing can be round and\nsquare. No problem, you might say. Nothing can be round and square at\na single time, place and world. But something can be round at one time\nand square at another.\n\nAccording to Lewis the original problem of temporary intrinsics\nremains, unless we can show how something can have incompatible\nproperties at different times. To show how that can be so we need to\ngive at least a partial answer to the following question. What is it\nfor something to have a property at a time?\n2.4 Candidate Solutions\n\nLewis considers three answers to this question. According to the first\nfor some object O to be F at t is for the\nrelation of being F to tenselessly, or timelessly, hold\nbetween O and time t. For example, for Plate to be\nround at t1 is for the two-place relation of being\nround at to hold between Plate and t1. Something\ncan stand in the relation of being round at to the earlier time\nt1 without standing in that relation to the later\ntime t2. So there is no reason to think that\nstanding in the relation of being round at to t1\nis incompatible with standing in the relation of being square at to\nt2. By transmuting the ostensibly one place\nrelational properties of being round and being square into the two\nplace relational properties of being round at and being square at we\ncan show how something can be round at one time and square at\nanother.\n\nLewis' principle objection to this first solution is that it\ntransforms intrinsic into extrinsic properties. He takes it as evident\nthat properties such as being round and being red are intrinsic. Why\nso? Call the view that putatively one place intrinsic properties are\ntwo place relational properties the relational view. Why does Lewis so\nadamantly reject that view? One difficulty with answering this\nquestion is a difficulty about locating the source of Lewis' disquiet\nwith the relational view.\n\nIs it that Lewis rejects the relational view because it treats\nputatively intrinsic properties as extrinsic, or because it discerns\nan extra place in a putatively monadic property? That it is the latter\nis suggested by the following. The problem of temporary intrinsics\nappears to arise because nothing can have the intrinsic properties of\nbeing round and being square, unless it has those properties at\ndifferent times. The same goes for pairs of extrinsic properties. The\nproperty of being the same height as the Eiffel Tower is extrinsic as\nis the property of being different in height from the Eiffel Tower.\nSomething can change from being the same height as the Eiffel Tower to\nbeing different in height from that structure even though nothing can\nsimultaneously have the properties of being the same height as, and\nbeing different in height from, the Eiffel Tower. Suppose we say that\nsomething can be the same height as the Eiffel Tower at some time\nt1 without being the same height as the Eiffel\ntower at some distinct time t2. In that case we\nappear to be confronted with the same problem as the one that\noriginally raised the problem of temporary intrinsics. We are\nconfronted with the task of explaining what it is for something to\nhave, in this case, the property of being the same height as the\nEiffel Tower at time t1. If we respond, it is for\nthe three place relation of being the same height as at to hold\nbetween some object, the Eiffel Tower, and time t1\nwe are, treating an ostensibly two place relation as a three place one\neven though we are not treating an intrinsic property as\nextrinsic.\n\nLewis considers an alternative explanation of what it is for an object\nto have a property at a time. What might be called the\n\u2018according to\u2019 explanation. We are used to something\nhaving a property according to one story, but failing to have that\nproperty according to another. If we think of a time as a set of\npropositions describing what holds at that time, we can say that\naccording to one such set plate is round, but according to another it\nis square.\n\nLewis gives the according to explanation short shrift. We may think it\ncannot be so readily dismissed if it is combined with a view about\nexistence and time that has received considerable discussion in recent\nyears. The view is called Presentism. On the Presentist view the only\nthings that exist without qualification are things that presently\nexist. Suppose t1, a time when Plate is round, is\nthe present. In that case if Plate is ever square it will be, or was\nsquare. What is it for Plate to be round? Given that plate is\npresently round what makes it the case that Plate is round is not just\nthat Plate is round according to some set of propositions about the\npresent. Instead what makes it the case that Plate is presently round\nis that plate exists and is round. So, what makes it the case that\nPlate, say, will be square? Not, the Presentist will say, this: Plate\ntenselessly or timelessly exists, and will be square. So what makes it\nthe case that Plate will be square? Perhaps this. What makes it true\nthat Plate will be square is that Plate is square according to some\nrelevant future tensed presently existing propositions.\n\nHere is one reason why we might think that Presentism does not, in the\nend, help with the problem of temporary intrinsics. Suppose that, at\nt1, we send a circular object forward in time to\nt2. At t2 the shape of the\ncircular object changes so that it becomes elliptical. Retaining its\nelliptical shape the object is sent back to t1. Even\nif Presentism is true at t1 we have an object with\nincompatible intrinsic properties.\n\nOf course, to embrace this combination of an according to explanation\nwith Presentism is to embrace just one of a number of options\navailable to the Presentist for giving the truthmakers of future and\npast tense propositions.\n\nWhether or not a Presentist wishes to take over in this way the\n\u2018according to\u2019 explanation, Presentism provides a solution\nto the problem of temporary intrinsics. Presentists can deny that it\nfollows from something at one time being round that will at another\ntime be square that there exists something both round and square.\n2.5 Alternative Solutions\n\n\nLewis, we saw, denies that a sentence such as \u2018Plate is square\nat t1\u2019 states something true just in case\nPlate stands in the square at relation to t1. In\nhis original exposition of the problem of temporary intrinsics, Lewis\ndoes not consider a variety of other ways of understanding sentences\nattributing ostensibly intrinsic properties to objects at times. Here\nis one. Many take it that a relation of instantiation holds between a\nproperty and its instances. Suppose instantiation is not a two place,\nbut, at least, a three place relation holding between an object,\nproperty and time. If so, Plate is round at t1 if\nand only if Plate stands in the instantiation relation to the\n(non-relational) property of roundness and t1.\nMoreover Plate standing in the instantiation relation to roundness and\nt1 is clearly consistent with Plate failing to\nstand in the instantiation relation to roundness and the different\ntime t2. The key difference between this view\nand the relational view that Lewis considers is the following. On the\nrelational view we take an ostensibly non-relational property such as\nbeing circular to be relational and extrinsic [extrinsic because\nhaving it requires an object to stand in a relation to a time]. On the\ninstantiation view we are taking something, the instantiation\nrelation, that is already an extrinsic relation to have an extra\nplace. So, our intuitions about what counts as an intrinsic\nnon-relational property are not violated.\n\n\nAlternative ways of taking \u2018a is red at\nt\u2019 include treating \u2018at t\u2019 as an\nadverbial modifier, or as a sentential operator. According to the\nfirst \u2018at t\u2019, better written as \u2018at\nt-ly\u2019, is an adverbial modifier specifying the way in\nwhich something has a property. So \u2018Plate is round at\nt1\u2019 is true just in case Plate has roundness\nat-t1-ly. Plate, on this view, can be round at\nt1, but square at t2 because\nPlate can have roundness at t1-ly without having\nroundness at-t2-ly (See Johnston 1987, Haslanger\n1989).\n\nAccording to the temporal operator view \u2018at\nt1\u2019 and \u2018at\nt2\u2019 should be understood as the temporal\noperators: \u2018at t1 it is true that\n\u2026\u2019 and \u2018at t2 it is true that\n\u2026\u2019. Just as \u2018it is possible that Plate is\nround\u2019 is consistent with \u2018it is possible that Plate is\nsquare\u2019 so \u2018at t1 it is true that\nPlate is round\u2019 is consistent with \u2018at\nt2 it is true that Plate is square\u2019.\n\nSolutions to the problem of temporary intrinsics abound. Here is\nanother that treats being true and being false as three place\nrelations between propositions, facts and times. Consider the\npropositions:\n\n(i) Plate is round,\n\n\nAnd:\n\n(ii) Plate is square.\n\n\nWe should distinguish between a property of a proposition, and a\nproperty that is a constituent of a proposition. Being a proposition\nis a property of (i), but is not a constituent of (i). In contrast,\nbeing round is a constituent of (i), but is not a property of (i).\nPropositions have no shape. Can we hold that (i) and (ii) are both\ntrue compatibly with taking roundness and squareness to be intrinsic\nproperties?\n\nIt is plausible to suppose that that the truth value of a proposition\nsuch as (i) or (ii) depends on the existence of something distinct\nfrom that proposition. Since that is so, let us, as some adherents of\na correspondence theory of truth would do, allow that if (i), say, is\ntrue, it has a relational property of being true. For example being\ntrue may be a relation that holds between (i) and the fact that Plate\nis round.\n\nHow many places are there in what we may call the truth relation? It\nis often though to be a two place relation. Suppose that is wrong, and\ntruth is a three place relation holding between a proposition, fact\nand time. In that case, the three place relation of truth can hold\nbetween (i), the fact that Plate is round, and t1,\nwithout holding between (i), the same fact and\nt2.\n\nOf course whether this is a solution to the problem of temporary\nintrinsics depends on what that problem is. It is a solution if the\nproblem is to explain time indexing without turning intrinsic into\nextrinsic properties. After all, no correspondance theorist would\nallow truth is an intrinsic property. It is not a solution if the\nproblem is to explain time indexing without adding extra places to, it\nmay be, relational properties.\n\nAlternatively, we can follow Haslanger in Haslanger 1989 and Lowe in\nLowe 1987 and treat the relevant propositions as tensed. A change in\nan intrinsic property corresponds, on this view, to a change in the\ntense of a proposition atrributing that property.\n\nLewis (2002) objects to this last solution on the grounds that a\ntensed proposition should itself be identified with a relational\nproperty. But, such identification leaves it unexplained how something\ncan change its non-relational intrinsic properties. Ben Caplan in\nCaplan 2005 has replied to Lewis that Lewis's objection depends on a\nview about propositions that is not compulsory.\n\nLewis favors a different solution to the problem of temporary\nintrinsics (Lewis 1986). Whether or not there is a problem with the\nsame object being round and square, there is no problem with the same\nobject having a round part and a square part. To solve the problem of\ntemporary intrinsics, Lewis invokes the view that, in addition to\ntheir spatial parts, objects have temporal parts or stages. This\nallows him to hold that Plate is round at t1 and\nsquare at t2 because Plate has a round part at\nt1 and a square part at t2.\nPlate's round t1 part exists only at\nt1, and Plate's square t2 part\nexists only at t2. Hence there is no problem posed\nby either temporal part changing its shape. Plate itself is an object\nconsisting of a suitably interrelated sequence of such temporal parts.\nFor the t1 temporal part of Plate to be round is\njust for it to be round. For the longer lived Plate to be round at\nt1 is for Plate to be appropriately related to a\nround temporal part at t1.\n\nAs we have seen in invoking temporal parts or stages Lewis endorses\none species of what has come to be called Four Dimensionalism. The\nexpression \u2018Four Dimensionalism\u2019 has been applied to a\nnumber of different positions that it is well to distinguish here\nsince not all of them are relevant to identity across time.\n\u2018Four Dimensionalism\u2019 has sometimes been used for the\nthesis, particularly associated with Relativity Theory, that time is\nspace like. On another use of \u2018Four Dimensionalism\u2019 a\npersisting thing is identical with its history. On this view an object\nis a sequence of events. Sometimes \u2018Four Dimensionalism\u2019\nis used to label the view that, contra Presentism, things past present\nand future are equally real.\n\nLewis' version of Four Dimensionalism should be distinguished from all\nof the above. It is the view that, just as an object such as Plate is\nextended in space with spatial parts, so it is extended in time with\ntemporal parts.\n\nThe problem of temporary intrinsics focuses on the possibility of\npersisting things changing their properties, or, at least, changing\ntheir intrinsic properties. Many of the problems about identity\nthrough time are posed by puzzle cases that involve change of parts.\nFour dimensionalism is one, widely accepted, solution to those\npuzzles. It is not overstretching it to suggest that each of the\npuzzle cases we will shortly consider appears to be a case of\ntemporary identity. That is, each one appears to be a case of the\nfollowing. For some x and y, at some time t\nx is identical with y, and at some time\nt\u2032 x is distinct from y.\n\nIn the first section we briefly looked at one argument, the so-called\nmodal argument for the necessity of identities, for denying that there\ncould be temporary identities. Some philosophers have responded to\nsome of the diachronic identity puzzles by maintaining that there\ncould be indeterminate identities. An argument with a similar\nstructure to the modal argument has been deployed to rule out\nindeterminate identities. Give their implications for identity across\ntime the modal argument and the argument against indeterminate\nidentities are set out in more detail in the next section.\n3. Necessary and Determinate Identities\n\nHere are two examples of identity statements:\n\n(i) The table in the next room is (now) identical with my favorite\ntable.\n\n\n(ii) The table in the next room is identical with the one you\npurchased last year.\n\n\n(i) and (ii) are contingent. Even if the table in the next room is my\nfavorite table, it might not have been. Even if the table in the next\nroom is the one you purchased last year, it might not have been. One\nof the most important discussions of identity is to be found in Saul\nKripke's paper \u2018Identity and Necessity\u2019 and his book\nNaming and Necessity (in Munitz 1971, Kripke 1980). One\nlesson to be learned from Kripke's discussion is that it is\nillegitimate to infer from identity statements such as (i) and (ii)\nhaving their truth value contingently that the relation of identity\ncan hold contingently.\n\nWhy is this inference illegitimate? Compare (i) with:\n\n(iii) The table in the next room is the same size as my favorite\ntable.\n\n\nBeing the same size as is an equivalence relation that holds\ncontingently. What does it take for that relation to hold contingently\nbetween the table in the next room and my favorite table? Thinking in\nterms of possible worlds the table in the next room is contingently\nthe same size as my favorite table just in case the following is so.\nThe table in the next room is the same size as my favorite table, but,\nin some possible world W, something identical to (or a\ncounterpart of) the actual table in the next room is not the same size\nas what is actually my favorite table.\n\nWithout having recourse to possible worlds, what this comes to is that\nthe table in the next room is contingently the same size as my\nfavorite table only if, in addition to (iii), the following is\ntrue:\n\n(iv) (\u2203x)(\u2203y)[(x = the table in the next room)\n& (y = my favorite table) & (possibly, x is\nnot the same size as y)].\n\n\nLikewise the table in the next room is contingently identical with my\nfavorite table only if, in some world W, what is actually my\nfavorite table is not identical with what is actually the table in the\nnext room. That condition need not be satisfied for (i) to be\ncontingently true. All it takes for (i) to be contingently true is\nthat, for example, (i) is true, but in some world W something\nqualifies as my favorite table without also qualifying as the table in\nthe next room. For that to be so nothing need be identical, or\ncounterpart related, across worlds.\n\nKripke and Ruth Barcan Marcus offer an argument to show that there are\nno contingent identities. Here is one version of that argument often\nreferred to as the Modal Argument for the Necessity of Identities:\n\nSuppose:\n\n(1) a=b.\n\n\nBut each thing is necessarily identical with itself. Hence;\n\n(2) \u25a1 (a=a)\n\n\nTaking \u2018[\u03bbx\u00a0\u03a6]\u2019 to mean: being an\nx such that \u03a6 (where \u03a6 is some logical formula in\nwhich \u2018x\u2019 is a free variable), we supposedly\nhave:\n\n(3) [\u03bbx\u00a0\u25a1(x=a)]a\n\n\nSince, by Leibniz's Law, if (1) then a and b share\nall properties in common. Hence (1) and (3) yield:\n\n(4) [\u03bbx\u00a0\u25a1(x=a)]b\n\n\nwhich in turn yields:\n\n(5) \u25a1(a=b).\n\n\nThough widely accepted this type of argument can be contested.\nLeibniz's Law, again understood as ranging over identity properties,\nis used to derive step (4)\u2014b has the property of being\nnecessarily identical with a\u2014from step (3), a\nhas the property of being necessarily identical with a. We\nmight deny that there are any such modal properties. Doing so blocks\nthe argument if the application of LL is restricted to properties.\nAlternatively we might allow that there are such properties as being\nnecessarily identical with a, but deny that (3) follows from\n(2). On one view all that follows from (2) is that a has the\nproperty of being necessarily identical with itself expressed by the\npredicate\n\u2018[\u03bbx\u00a0x=x]\u2019. We need\nto distinguish the property of being necessarily identical with\nitself, which every existent has, from the property of being\nnecessarily identical with a\u2014which only a has\n(Lowe 1982). Finally, we might reject (2) on the following grounds.\nThere is a well entrenched convention that repeated tokens of the same\ntype of name, constant or variable are assigned the same value. From\nthe existence of this convention it follows that \u2018a =\na\u2019 expresses a truth. It does not follow that\n\u2018a = a\u2019 expresses something necessarily\ntrue.\n\nHere is one way of making clear why it does not follow. According to\nwhat we may call the identity convention two tokens of the same name\nstandardly refer to the same thing. So in, for example, the sentence\n\u2018Napoleon admires Napoleon\u2019 we are, unless otherwise\nindicated, to take the second occurrence of \u2018Napoleon\u2019 to\nhave a referent identical with the referent of the first. In the case\nof \u2018Napoleon admires Napoleon\u2019 the relation Napoleon is\nsaid to stand in to himself is different from the relation governing\nthe repeated use of a proper name. In the one case it is the relation\nof admiration. In the other it is identity. But, suppose they were the\nsame relation. Suppose, the repeated use of a proper name were\ngoverned, not by the identity convention, but by what we may call the\nadmiration convention. According to the admiration convention a\nsubsequent occurrence of a proper name in a sentence should be taken\nto refer to something only if it is admired by the referent of the\nfirst occurrence. In the light of this, admittedly bizarre, convention\nwhat should we say about the truth value of \u2018Napoleon admires\nNapoleon\u2019. Well if the second occurrence of\n\u2018Napoleon\u2019 refers, it will refer to someone admired by the\nreferent of the first occurrence. So, if the admiration convention is\nadhered to, \u2018Napoleon admires Napoleon\u2019 will, if it\nexpresses any proposition, will express a true one. Despite that,\n\u2018Napoleon admires Napoleon\u2019 expresses a contingent truth.\nLikewise, \u2018a=a\u2019 expresses a true proposition\nif it expresses any proposition at all, since the relation governing\nthe repeated use of \u2018a\u2019 is the same as the one that\na is said to stand in to a. But, as with \u2018Napoleon admires\nNapoleon\u2019 given the admiration convention, there is no reason to\nsuppose that the truth expressed by \u2018a=a\u2019 is\na necessary one. A like observation applies to \u2018a is\nidentical with itself\u2019.\n\nPhilosophers have appealed to contingent identities to solve identity\npuzzles. They have also appealed to vague or indeterminate identities\nto solve such puzzles. Consider a club that over an extended time\nchanges its rules, membership and location. Is the original club\nidentical with the club having a new location, rules and membership?\nCall the original club the Identity Club, and the club with new rules,\nmembership and location the Constitution Club. Is the following\ntrue?:\n\nC: The Identity Club = The Constitution Club.\n\n\nSome would say that that the identity stated by C is vague or\nindeterminate. What does it mean to say that an identity is vague or\nindeterminate? At least this. C is not determinately true, or\ndeterminately false. If C does lack a determinate truth value, is that\nenough to ensure that the identity of the clubs referred to by C is\nindeterminate?\n\nIn the case of the identity sentence:\n\n(i) The table in the next room is (now) identical with my favorite\ntable.\n\n\nwe saw the need to distinguish between (i) having its truth value\ncontingently, and (i) stating an identity that holds only\ncontingently. We likewise need to distinguish C having an\nindeterminate truth value from C stating an identity that holds only\nindeterminately. C may lack a determinate truth value because one, or\nboth, of the referring expressions \u2018The Identity Club\u2019 and\n\u2018The Constitution Club\u2019 lacks a determinate referent.\nNevertheless for any determinate choice of referents for those\nexpressions C has a determinate truth value.\n\nCan it happen that the referring expressions \u2018a\u2019\nand \u2018b\u2019 refer precisely in the identity sentence\n\u2018a=b\u2019 without that sentence being\ndeterminately true or false? Here is one version of an argument, due\nto Gareth Evans and Nathan Salmon, that is supposed to show that it\ncannot (Evans 1978, Salmon 1981). Let \u2018Ip\u2019 mean:\nit is indeterminate whether p, that is p is neither\ndeterminately true nor determinately false, and let\n\u2018Dp\u2019 mean: it is determinate that p. We\nhave:\n\n(1\u2032) I(a=b).\n\n\nBut:\n\n(2\u2032) D (a=a).\n\n\n(2\u2019) yields:\n\n(3\u2032)\n[\u03bbx\u00a0D(x=a)]a\n\n\nSuppose:\n\n(4\u2032) a=b\n\n\nApplying Leibniz's Law to (3\u2032) and (4\u2032) gives:\n\n(5\u2032)\n[\u03bbx\u00a0D(a=x)]b\n\n\nfrom which it follows that:\n\n(6\u2032) D(a=b),\n\n\nwhich contradicts (1\u2032). Hence (1\u2032) implies:\n\n(7\u2032) \u00ac(a=b)\n\n\nIf (7\u2032) is true then it is not true that a is identical\nwith b. So if (7\u2032) is true, a is determinately\ndistinct from b. (1\u2032) cannot be true.\n\nOf course, defenders of indeterminate identity do not let this pass\nunquestioned. One assumption of the argument is that (7\u2032)\nimplies that a is determinately distinct from b\nrather than just that a is not determinately identical with\nb.\n\nArguments against contingent and indeterminate identities appeal to\nLeibniz's Law. Seen as a principle about the transmission of\nproperties across identity Leibniz's Law has rarely been challenged.\nStill, it has been challenged. One interesting challenge is brought by\nBenjamin Schnieder in Schnieder 2006. Similarly, Evans' argument has\nbeen challenged from a number of directions. A recent challenger is\nElizabeth Barnes who in Barnes 2009 invokes counterpart theory to\ndefuse it.\n4. Diachronic Identity Puzzles\n\nIn the introduction we encountered one type of puzzle about identity\nacross time: the case of Cup and Tcup. The puzzle arose because we\nenvisaged Cup losing one of its parts, and coming to have the same\nmaterial constitution (being, for example, composed of exactly the\nsame atoms as), and spatial boundaries as Tcup. Call this the cup\ncase. Let us say that a and b are coincident at a\ntime t just in case the following holds. Something is a\nproper part of a at t if and only if it is a proper\npart of b at that same time. Cup and Tcup are coincident at\nthe later time since something at that later time is, for example, and\natomic part of a if and only if it is an atomic part of\nb.\n\nThere are cases that pose similar diachronic identity puzzles that do\nnot involve change of parts. One of the best known involves a lump of\nclay which, at an earlier time, is coincident with a statue, but, at a\nlater, say as a result of deformation, is just a shapeless lump of\nclay. Other much discussed cases of putatively distinct things at one\ntime being coincident at another involve fission or fusion. One of the\nmost famous examples of a fission case is provided by the ship of\nTheseus. Over a long period all of the planks composing a certain ship\nare replaced one by one. Eventually a ship indiscernible from the\noriginal, but composed of entirely different planks, results. Call\nthat later ship Replacement. As each plank is removed from the\noriginal ship it is used to construct a ship that is constituted from\nall and only the planks belonging to the original ship. Call the ship\ncomposed of the same planks as the ones initially composing the\noriginal ship Reassembly.\n\nIdentity is, very plausibly, an equivalence relation (see\n Section 2.2).\n One consequence of it being an equivalence relation is that it is\nsubject to transitivity: the principle that if aRb and\nbRc, then aRc. Saying that, in the case of Theseus'\nship, Replacement and Reassembly are both identical with the original\nship putatively conflicts with the transitivity of identity since\nReplacement seems to be later clearly distinct from Reassembly.\n\nWhat is the best account of these cases? Here are some of the major\nones on offer:\n4.1 Constitution\n\nConstitution accounts pivot on the distinction between constitution\nand identity. Defenders of such accounts hold that constitution,\nunlike identity, is not an equivalence relation (Baker 2002).\nConstitution is said to be, at least, non-symmetrical. According to a\nconstitution account, we say the following about the three types of\npuzzle cases described above. Cup is never identical with Tcup. Later\nCup is constituted by Tcup [alternatively: Cup and Tcup never\nconstitute each other, but later are constituted from the very same\natoms]. Likewise the lump of clay is never identical with the statue,\nbut earlier only constitutes the statue. Finally, the reassembly ship\nis never identical, but only constituted from exactly the same planks\nas, the original.\n\nKit Fine has deployed a number of novel Leibniz's Law arguments in\nfavour of a constitution accounts. Such arguments are replied to by\nBrian Frances in Frances 2006.\n\nThe constitution view has come in for its share of criticisms. Some\nthink it engages in metaphysical multiple vision, seeing a\nmultiplicity of things at a given place and time where there is\nplausibly only one. Others argue that constitution is\nidentity (see Noonan 1993).\n\nA number of objections have been raised against constitution views.\nOne is an objection from causal overdetermination. Another is an\nobjection from grounding. Consider a statue allegedly constituted from\na statue shaped piece of clay. Someone throws the statue against a\npane of glass, which breaks. What caused the glass to break? Surely,\nthe statue impacting it. But the glass was also impacted by the statue\nshaped piece of clay with sufficient force to break it. So, if\nconstitution is not identity, the glass breaking has two causes. Some\nwould say that is one cause too many.\n\nThe objection from grounding is not so much an objection to the\nconstitution view, but an objection designed to undermine a principle\nreason for adopting it. A principle reason for adopting the\nconstitution view is that it seems to allow, for example, the statue\nand the piece of clay to have different properties. In particular, it\nseems to allow them to have different modal properties such as being\nsquashable. Since constitution, unlike identity, does not conform to\nthe indiscernibility of identicals, the clay can be squashable even if\nthe statue is not.\n\nThe problem is that the clay and the statue are made up of exactly the\nsame atoms organized in the same way. Since that is so it is hard to\nsee how the clay can be squashable without the statue being so as\nwell.\n\nA further problem for constitution views is the so called too many\nminds objection (see Olsen 1997 and Shoemaker 1999). Advocates of\nconstitutionalism typically hold that a person is constituted by a\nliving organism. If so, the person and the living organism\nconstituting that person share the same thoughts. Whenever you\nencounter a person you encounter a distinct living organism having\noccupying the same region and having the same thoughts. Not a good\nresult.\n4.2 Relative Identity\n\nAdvocates of relative identity deny that there is a single identity\nrelation (see Geach 1967, Griffin 1977). On their view it is improper\nto ask whether, say, the statue is the same thing as the later lump of\nclay. Instead we should ask whether it is the same statue, or the same\nlump of clay. For an advocate of relative identity denying that the\nearlier statue is the same statue as the later lump of clay is\nconsistent with allowing that the earlier statue is the same lump of\nclay as the later lump of clay. It is natural for the relative\nidentity theorist to insist on relativising the transitivity of\nidentity to the same sortal concept in the following way. What the\nrelativised transitivity principle says is that: a is the\nsame F as b, and b is the same F\nas c implies only that a is the same F as\nc (see Griffin 1977).\n\nOne objection to relative identity is that it conflicts with Leibniz's\nLaw. Here is one way in which such conflict may be thought to arise.\nConsider the property version of Leibniz's Law:\n\nLL: \u2200x\u2200y[x=y \u2192\n\u2200F(Fx \u2192 Fy)]\n\n\nThe relation of identity mentioned in the antecedent of LL is\nunrelativised to a sortal. To make it acceptable to the relative\nidentity theorist, let us amend LL to:\n\nLLR:\n\u2200x\u2200y[\u2200F(x is\nthe same F as y) \u2192\n\u2200G(Gx \u2192 Gy)]\n\n\nSuppose we replace \u2018is the same F as y\u2019\nin LLR with \u2018is the same lump of clay\u2019,\n\u2018x\u2019 with \u2018the earlier statue\u2019,\n\u2018y\u2019 with \u2018the later clay lump\u2019, and\ninstantiate the quantifier \u2200G with \u2018is the same\nstatue as the earlier statue\u2019. We then obtain:\n\nR: the earlier statue is the same lump of clay as the later clay lump\n\u2192 (the earlier statue is the same statue as the earlier statue\n\u2192 the earlier statue is the same statue as the later clay lump ).\n\n\nThe trouble is that R is false. The earlier statue is the same lump of\nclay as the clay lump, and the earlier statue is the same statue is\nthe same statue as the earlier statue, but the earlier statue is not,\ncontrary to LLR, the same statue as the later clay lump.\n4.3 Identity: \u2018Strict\u2019 and \u2018Loose\u2019\n\nFollowing Bishop Butler [see\n Section 5],\n Roderick Chisholm distinguishes between a strict and a loose sense of\nidentity (see Chisholm 1969a). To see what this distinction comes to,\nand how it might help with the puzzle cases, consider the case of Cup\nand Tcup. For Chisholm things have their parts essentially in the\nfollowing sense. It is impossible for a to be identical with\nb in the strict and philosophical sense, unless a\nand b have all their parts in common. Earlier Cup has a part,\na handle, that later Cup, not to say earlier and later Tcup, lacks.\nHence, on Chisholm's view, earlier Cup is not strictly identical with\nlater Cup.\n\nEarlier Cup is nontheless identical with later Cup in a loose and\npopular sense. What then, according to Chisholm, is it for earlier Cup\nand later Cup to be identical in a loose and popular sense? To\nsimplify let us suppose, unrealistically, that the only change of\nparts that Cup in, Chisholm would say, a loose and popular sense\nundergoes is loss of a handle. Call Hcup the object that consists of\nCup's handle together with Tcup. Chisholm would say this. Cup is\nearlier wholly constituted by Hcup, that is Tcup plus handle, and\nlater wholly constituted by Tcup alone. Moreover Tcup is related to\nHcup in such a way that, as Chisholm puts it, Tcup at\nt2 is the ens successivum of Hcup at an\nearlier time t1. For Chisholm what makes\nTcup at t2 an ens successivum of Hcup at\nt1 seems to be this. Tcup is a proper part of Hcup\nat t1. There is a sequence S of cups such\nthat each member of S that is not identical with Hcup is, at\nsome time, a proper part of some member of S. For each time\nbetween and including t1 and\nt2 Cup is wholly constituted by some member of\nS.\n\nCup is wholly constituted by Tcup at t2. Since the\nlater Cup is wholly constituted by something, Tcup, that is an ens\nsuccessivum of something, Hcup, that wholly constitutes Cup we\nmay say that earlier cup is loosely identical with later Cup.\n4.4 Arbitrary Undetached Parts\n\nOne solution to the problem posed by the cup case is to reject what\nPeter van Inwagen calls the Doctrine of Arbitrary Undetached Parts\n(see van Inwagen 1981). In setting the problem up we assumed that\nearlier Cup consists of the following parts: a handle together with\nTcup. That assumption is justified if the following is. Tcup existed\nas a part of Cup when Cup still had its handle. Van Inwagen would\nreject that assumption. According to him it is illegitimate to assume\nthat any old way of notionally dividing up an object yields an\nexisting undetached part.\n\nInstead of denying that Tcup exists at t1 when it\nis ostensibly a proper part of Cup, we might instead deny that Tcup at\nt1 is identical with what looks very much like\nTcup at t2. In this way we can preserve\ntransitivity without having to identify the earlier cup with one of\nits proper parts.\n\nOne way to allow that Tcup earlier exists without conceding its later\nidentity with Cup is, following Michael Burke, to maintain that Tcup\ngoes out of existence when Cup loses its handle (see Burke 1994).\n4.5 Four Dimensionalism\n\nHere is what a classical four dimensionalist would say about the case\nof the cup. Suppose the interval from t1 to\nt2 is the time during which Cup has a handle\nattached to it, and t2 to t3\nthe interval during which Cup is without a handle, and, so, putatively\nidentical with Tcup. As before Hcup is the fusion of Tcup and Cup's\nhandle. According to the four dimensionalist, Cup, Tcup and Hcup are\nall extended in time as well as space. Tcup has a temporal part that\nextends from t1 to t2 together\nwith a temporal part that extends from t2 to\nt3. Tcup's t1 to\nt2 and t2 to\nt3 temporal parts are distinct from each other as\nwell as being distinct from the temporally longer Tcup. Hcup, that is\nTcup plus handle, is a four dimensional object that extends from\nt1 to t2. Cup itself consists\nof the following two, among indefinitely many other, temporal parts:\nHcup and the t2 to t3 part of\nTcup.\n\nWhat we should say according to the classical four dimensionalist is\nthis. The t1 to t2 temporal\npart of Tcup is a proper temporal and spatial part of Hcup. Hcup and\nthe t2 to t3 temporal parts of\nTcup are proper temporal parts of Cup. Cup is not identical with any\nof Hcup, Tcup from t1 to t2,\nTcup from t2 to t3, or Tcup\nfrom t1 to t3. In particular\nthere is no question of Cup being literally identical with Tcup from\nt2 to t3, when they are\nindiscernible, though, following David Lewis, we may say that Cup and\nTcup are identical at any time between t2 and\nt3 in the sense that they share temporal parts\nduring those times (see Lewis 1986).\n\nMany four-dimensionalists subscribe to a principle that a number of\nwriters call unrestricted mereological composition. According to that\nprinciple any set of, in this case four-dimensional, objects\nconstitute a further four dimensional object. Armed with the\nunrestricted mereological composition principle a four-dimensionalist\ncan say that what there is, in the case of Theseus' ship, is a Y\nbranching object dividable in an indefinite number of ways into four\ndimensional proper parts an indefinite number of which are ships. For\nexample the ship consisting of the stem together with the replacement\nbranch has as two of its proper parts a ship consisting of just the\nstem, and one consisting of just the replacement branch.\n\nApart from the argument that it provides the best solution to\ndiachronic identity puzzles four dimensionalism has been defended on a\nnumber of other grounds. One we have reviewed already; the argument\nthat four dimensionalism gives the best solution to the problem of\ntemporary intrinsics. Another, also offered by David Lewis, invokes\nthe principle that facts in general supervene on facts about the\ninstantiations of intrinsic properties and external relations. Call\nfacts about the instantiation of intrinsic properties and external\nrelations basic facts, and let R be the spatio-temporal\nregion occupied by Plate throughout its career. According to Lewis\nthere is a world W in which a sequence of shorter Plate-like\nobjects occupy R, and all of the basic facts that obtain in\nour world obtain in W. Lewis' supervenience principle tells\nus that all facts supervene on basic facts. The same basic facts\nobtain in both our world and W. So whatever is true of the\noccupant of R in W is true of the occupant of\nR in our world. The occupant of R in W is a\nsequence of, appropriately interrelated Plate-like objects. Hence the\noccupant of R in our world, that is Plate, is likewise a\nsequence of interrelated Plate-like objects.\n\nRecently Sider (2002) developed an argument for Four Dimensionalism\nfrom considerations about vagueness. He argues that Four\nDimensionalism is true if it cannot be vague how many things there\nare, and also that it cannot be vague how many things there are.\n\nIt should be noted that Sider and Katherine Hawley defend an\nalternative version of Four Dimensionalism which identifies objects\nwith what, on the first version, would qualify as their stages (Hawley\n2001, Sider 2002). In order to make this identification Sider invokes\nsomething close to Lewis\u2019 counterpart relation. Will the table I am\ncurrently looking at persist through the next ten minutes? According\nto the classical four-dimensionalist, otherwise known as the\nperdurantist, the table will persist through that period provided it\nhas a present and a ten minutes from now table stage that are both\nstages of the table without either one being identical with the table.\nIn contrast the stage theorist identifies the table with the present\nstage of the table. How can that be since the present table stage only\nexists now, and the table is supposed to be around ten minutes from\nnow? It can be, says the stage theorist, because, though the ten\nminute from now table stage is not now identical with the table, it\nwill be identical with the table. Moreover it will be identical with\nthe table since it stands in the appropriate counterpart relation to\nthe present table stage.\n\nStage theory enjoys the following advantage over classical\nfour-dimensionalism. Consider the case of a person fissioning into two\nlater people. A classical four-dimensionalist like Lewis will say that\nbefore the fission there are two separate people that cannot be told\napart. The stage theorist has no need to say that. Instead the stage\ntheorist can say there is a single present person who will be\nidentical with each of a pair of later individuals in virtue of\nstanding in the relevant counterpart relations to each one.\n\nIt should also be noted that four dimensionalism differs from\nChisholm's invocation of loose and popular identity in, at least, the\nfollowing way. The persistence of an object for any length of time\nwill, on a four dimensionalist view, require the existence of shorter\nlived objects setting aside the possibility of extended simples. The\npersistence for any length of time, on Chisholm's view, of a three\ndimensional object does not require the existence of shorter lived\nthree dimensional objects. It does not do so because the object\npersisting for a lengthy period may undergo no change of parts.\n4.6 Temporary Identity\n\nIn the case of, for example, the truncated cup we saw that one option\nis to claim that Cup is earlier distinct from Tcup [cup minus its\nhandle], but later identical with Tcup. According to this option the\nidentity of Cup with Tcup is only temporary. We also saw that many\nrefuse to countenance temporary identity because it allegedly\nconflicts with Leibniz's Law [LL]. After all, later Cup, but not Tcup,\napparently later has the property of having had a handle.\n\nDespite this putative conflict with LL, some philosophers are prepared\nto defend temporary identity as the best solution to the puzzles about\ndiachronic identity. George Myro does so by restricting the scope of\nLL to exclude such properties as having had a handle (Myro 1985).\nGallois (1998) does so by arguing that if the identity of Cup and Tcup\nis temporary, we cannot infer from Tcup having had a handle earlier\nthat earlier Tcup has a handle.\n4.7 Further Puzzle Cases\n\nWe have focused attention on one type of case that raises a puzzle\nabout diachronic identity. Such a case involves something ostensibly\nbecoming, or ceasing to be identical with something that is ostensibly\none of its earlier or later proper parts. It would be wrong to give\nthe impression that such a \u201cDeon-Theon\u201d case named after\nthe individuals involved in the example is the only, or even main,\ntype of case posing a problem about diachronic identity. In addition\nthere are what are often referred to as fission and fusion cases. A\nfission case has the following features. We have putatively distinct\nthings b and c existing at some later time\nt2. Each of b and c is related\nto a, which exists at an earlier time t1,\nin such a way that each one is ostensibly identical with\na.\n\nFission cases come in two varieties: symmetrical and asymmetrical.\nExamples of symmetrical fission cases include amoebic and hemispheric\ndivision [for the latter see Personal Identity below]. In a\nsymmetrical case there is some relation that each of b and\nc stand in to a, where standing in that relation is\nwhat makes each one putatively identical with a. In an\nasymmetric case, b is putatively identical with a because it\nstands in a certain relation to a, but c is\nputatively identical with a because it stands in a different\nrelation to a. The best known example of a symmetrical\nfission case is the Ship of Theseus described at the beginning of this\nsection.\n\nLet us see how the proposals for dealing with the cup case apply to\nfission cases. Constitution only delivers a candidate solution in a\nsymmetric fission case. As we noted above, a constitution theorist can\nsay the following about Theseus' Ship. The ship resulting from the\nreplacement of the original planks is identical with, but not\nconstituted from the original planks. The ship reconstituted from the\noriginal planks is not identical with the one originally constituted\nfrom those planks.\n\nSome relative identity theorists have this to say about Theseus' Ship.\nIn that case conflict with the transitivity of identity is avoided by\nmaintaining the following. The replacement ship is the same ship as\nthe original, and the original is the same collection of planks as the\nreassembly ship. Conflict with transitivity is avoided because we need\nnot allow that the reassembly ship is the same ship as the\noriginal.\n\nDistinguishing between a strict and loose sense of\n\u2018identical\u2019 yields the following solution in the case of\nTheseus' Ship. Let Original be the original ship, Replacement be the\nship that results from replacing Original's original planks, and\nReassembly the one that results from their reassembly. In that case,\ndeploying the distinction between a strict and loose sense of\nidentity, we can say this. Reassembly is strictly identical with\nOriginal, but Replacement is only loosely identical with Original. A\nconflict with transitivity of identity is avoided for the following\nreason. It follows by transitivity from Replacement being identical\nwith Original, and Original being identical with Reassembly, that\nReplacement is identical with Reassembly only if a single relation of\nidentity is involved.\n\nHere is what a four dimensionalist such as Lewis will say about\nTheseus' ship. In that case there are two initially indiscernible\nships. The first is a four dimensionally extended ship located where\nthe original ship is initially located that ends up coinciding only\nwith the reassembly ship. The second, also initially located where the\noriginal ship is initially ends up coinciding with the replacement\nship. We thus have a Y-branching four dimensionally extended object\nwith one ship constituted by the stem together with one branch, and\nthe other constituted by the stem together with the remaining\nbranch.\n\nFour Dimensionalism, like the thesis that identities can be temporary,\napplies to both symmetric and asymmetric cases of fission.\n\nA temporary identity theorist will hold that Replacement and\nReassembly are identical at t1, but distinct ships\nat t2.\n\nIn the previous section we reviewed an argument designed to rule out\nindeterminate identities. If that argument can be met, it is open to\nus to say the following about Theseus' Ship. Each of Replacement and\nReassembly is indeterminately identical with Original.\n\nThe puzzle cases are puzzle cases because they bring into putative\nconflict intuitions all of which we want to subscribe to. Consider a\nstatue and the collection of atoms that constitute it. We wish to say\nthat the statue is identical with the collection of atoms. We also\nwish to say that the statue, but not the collection, can survive the\nloss of one atom belonging to that collection. Leibniz's Law appears\nto force us to renounce one of these intuitions. Thomas Sattig argues\nfor a compatibilist view according to which we can hold on to both\nintuitions without giving up, or modifying, Leibniz's Law. We can do\nso by relativising identities to different perspectives. From the\nordinary object perspective the statue is distinct from the atoms that\nconstitute it. From the material object perspective the statue is\nidentical with the atoms that constitute it.\n5. Personal Identity\n\nPersonal identity is perhaps the most extensively discussed special\ncase of identity. What is it for a person existing at one time to be\nidentical to a person existing at another? This question was first\nclearly posed by John Locke in his celebrated discussion of personal\nidentity in the Essay (Locke 1975). Locke distinguishes\nbetween being the same man and being the same person. To be the same\nman is to be the same member of the species human being. For Locke\nwhat is crucial is that having the same consciousness is not\nsufficient for being the same man, but is sufficient for being the\nsame person.\n\nFamously Locke calls the concept of a person a forensic concept. For\nLocke much of the importance attaching to being the same person is\nthat moral responsibility for past deeds goes with being the same\nperson, rather than being the same man or even the same immaterial\nsubstance, as a past person. In his view it is enough to be morally\nresponsible for some deed that one is the same person as its\nperformer. It is not required that one be the same man or the same\nimmaterial substance as the one who performed the act in question.\n\nWhat then, according to Locke, is it to have the same consciousness as\nsome past person? He is customarily interpreted as holding that person\nA is the same person as earlier person B just in\ncase A is able to remember enough of what happened to\nB. This is sometimes referred to as the memory criterion of\npersonal identity. The memory criterion was criticized by Butler and\nReid principally because it was said to be circular, and, as a\ncriterion of personal identity, incompatible with the transitivity of\nidentity. (See Section 2.2, and Joseph Butler \u2018Of Personal\nIdentity\u2019 and Thomas Reid \u2018Of Mr. Locke's Account of Our\nPersonal Identity\u2019 in Perry 1975.)\n\nThe argument for the circularity of the memory criterion went like\nthis. Suppose we think of the memory criterion as giving what would be\nlater called an analysis of A being the same person as\nB. If so, we are invited to analyze A being the same\nperson as b in terms of A remembering enough of what\nhappened to B. But any plausible analysis of A\nremembering what happened to B will mention, in the\nanalysans, A being the same person as B.\n\nSydney Shoemaker has responded to the circularity charge by\ndistinguishing remembering from what he calls Q-remembering (Shoemaker\n1975). A Q-remembers something that happened to b\njust in case there is an appropriate causal link between the event\nQ-remembered and A's memory impression of that event. Unlike\nremembering, Q-remembering a past experience does not imply the\nidentity of the one having the Q-memory with the one who had the\nexperience. We can avoid the charge of circularity by restating the\nmemory criterion in the following way. A is the same person\nas some earlier individual B if and only if A\nQ-remembers enough of what happened to B.\n\nThe charge that the memory criterion conflicts with the transitivity\nof identity was illustrated by the famous case of the schoolboy, the\nyoung lieutenant and the elderly general (Reid 1975). The elderly\ngeneral can Q-remember enough of what happened to the young lieutenant\nto qualify, by the memory criterion, as being the same person as the\nyoung lieutenant. The young lieutenant in turn Q-remembers enough of\nwhat happened to the young schoolboy. But the elderly general can\nremember almost nothing of what happened to the young schoolboy. Since\nthe memory criterion has it that A Q-remembering enough of\nwhat happened to B is a necessary condition for A\nbeing the same person as an earlier person B, it follows\nthat, according to the memory criterion, the elderly general is not\nthe same person as the young schoolboy. Hence, the memory criterion\nimplies, contrary to the transitivity of identity, that, although the\nelderly general is the same person as the young lieutenant, and the\nyoung lieutenant is the same person as the schoolboy, the elderly\ngeneral is not the same person as the young schoolboy.\n\nThe memory criterion came to be modified in two further ways. The\nfirst modification provides a way of reconciling the memory criterion\nwith the transitivity of identity in the light of cases such as the\nelderly general. Instead of saying that A is the same person\nas some earlier B if and only if A can Q-remember\nenough of what happened to B, we say the following.\nA is the same person as B if and only if there is a\nQ-memory chain linking A with B. For there to be a\nQ-memory link between A and B, either A\nremembers enough of what happened to B, or A\nremembers enough of what happened to someone who remembers enough of\nwhat happened to B, or A remembers enough of what\nhappened to someone who remembers enough of what happened to someone\nwho remembers enough of what happened to B, and so on. In the\ncase of the elderly general, the elderly general does remember enough\nof what happened to, someone, the young lieutenant, who remembers\nenough of what happened to the young schoolboy to count, by the\nmodified criterion, as the same person as the young schoolboy.\n\nThe second modification extends the memory criterion to include\nforward looking psychological connections, such as that between\npresent intention and future action, as determinants of personal\nidentity.\n\nWith these modifications incorporated the memory criterion has come to\nbe known as the psychological continuity criterion of personal\nidentity. The psychological continuity criterion is an improvement on\nthe original memory criterion. Nevertheless one of the problems\nconfronting the original memory criterion, its putative conflict with\nthe transitivity of identity, can be brought against its successor in\na different form. We saw that making certain identifications in a\nfission case such as the ship of Theseus [see Section 4: Diachronic\nIdentity Puzzles] threatens the transitivity of identity. One much\ndiscussed type of fission case, hemispheric division, is taken by many\nto show that the psychological continuity criterion is, after all,\nincompatible with the transitivity of identity (Nagel 1975).\n\nSuppose, as may one day be medically feasible, an individual\nA's still functioning upper brain is transplanted from\nA's body to the debrained, but living, body formerly\nbelonging to B. Upon being transplanted A's upper brain is\nconnected to what remains of B's central nervous system so\nthat a person, call her A-B, results.\nA-B believes herself to be A, can\nQ-remember what happened to A, has A's psychological\ndispositions, and so on. Should we say that A-B is\nthe same person as A, the same person as B, or an\naltogether new person? Psychological continuity theorists will have\nlittle hesitation in answering that A-B is the same\nperson as A.\n\nA person can function fairly normally with much of their brain\ndestroyed. Suppose A loses an entire brain hemisphere. Given\nthe plasticity of the brain, and aided by our hypothetical future\nmedical technology, it may be that A could survive such a\nloss. If so, it would be unreasonable to deny that A could\nsurvive the transplantation of only one brain hemisphere given that\nshe could survive the transplantation of he entire intact upper\nbrain.\n\nThe putative conflict with transitivity arises when we consider a case\nin which both of the separated hemispheres of A's original\nbrain are transplanted to separate bodies resulting in what certainly\nlook to be distinct individuals. Suppose, one of A's brain\nhemispheres is transferred to B's body, resulting in a person\nPB, and the other to C's body resulting in a person\nPC. It flouts transitivity to say that PC is\nidentical with A, and that A is identical with\nPB, but deny, at it seems we should, that PC is\nidentical with PB.\n\nThere are a number of ways that defenders of a psychological\ncontinuity criterion have attempted to evade this result. One, adopted\nby David Lewis, goes like this (Lewis 1976). We say that earlier, when\nA is around with an intact brain, there are two indiscernible\nindividuals, PB and PC, sharing a single body.\nAnother, advocated by Robert Nozick, concedes that if both hemispheres\nare successfully transplanted, neither of the later individuals with\njust one brain hemisphere is identical with the earlier one with an\nintact brain, but insist that if only one hemisphere is transplanted,\nthe resulting individual is identical with the former possessor of two\nhemispheres. On this view whether, for example, PB is\nidentical with the earlier person with A's body depends on\nwhether there is an equally good later candidate, such as PC,\nfor being the earlier A-body person (Nozick 1981).\n\nIn one of the most influential discussions of personal identity Derek\nParfit defends a view close to Nozick's by distinguishing between\nsurvival and identity (in Perry 1975). In Nozick's view what\npsychological continuity guarantees is not identity, but survival. In\nthe case where both of A's hemispheres are transplanted to\nyield PB and PC, A survives as PB,\nand survives as PC, though she is identical with neither\nPB nor PC.\n\nParfit, Nozick and Lewis all take psychological continuity to be\nintegral to personal identity in the following sense. In cases where\nthere is no branching psychological continuity is sufficient to ensure\nthe identity of a later with an earlier person. A number of\nphilosophers would reject this claim insisting that bodily persistence\nis required for personal identity. Some, for example Eric Olson, would\nargue that psychological continuity is irrelevant to the identity of\nthose things, human beings, who are the only things we know to be\npersons. Instead, on this view, what is crucial to personal identity\nfor humans is continuing to be the same animal (Olson 1997).\n",
