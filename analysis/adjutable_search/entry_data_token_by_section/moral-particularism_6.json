Do Particularism and Generalism Differ in Practice or Only in Theory?\n\n\nParticularists are fond of saying that generalists will make bad\ndecisions. One reason for this is that generalism seems to validate\ncertain patterns of argument that particularists would think of as\ninvalid. For instance, a generalist might think \u2018Feature F made\na difference in that case; so it must make the same sort of difference\nhere too\u2019. If our decision in the second case was influenced by\nsuch \u2018reasoning\u2019, it would have been influenced by a\nmistake, according to the particularist. Particularism supposes that\none cannot extract from one case anything that is guaranteed to make a\ndifference to another.  They recommend keeping one\u2019s eyes firmly fixed\non the case before one rather than trying to squeeze an answer to one\nproblem out of the answer to another. This does not show that there is\nnothing to be learnt from other cases. Particularists can even allow\nthat it might, on occasion, be impossible to see the right answer here\nif one does not work to that answer from consideration of other cases,\nsuitably constructed or provided by experience. One can perfectly well\nsay \u2018this feature mattered there, and so it might well matter\nhere\u2014I had better have a look and see whether it does or\nnot\u2019. What one cannot and should not do is to say \u2018it\nmattered there and so it must matter here\u2019. So\nparticularists allow a relevance to moral experience; they are not\nreduced to just gazing vacantly at the case before them and coming up\nwith an answer that somehow seems appropriate. There is a practical\ndifference between particularism and generalism, but it is not\nthis.\n\n\nThere is another possible practical difference between the two. This\ncomes out when we consider two pretty similar cases of which we\nnonetheless want to make different judgements. Nobody supposes that\nthis is impossible. The question is rather what is rationally required\nof the judge in such a case. The generalist might end up demanding\nthat one make the same judgement in both cases unless one can provide\na principle that distinguishes them. The particularist, by contrast,\nmight demand only that one make the same judgement in both cases\nunless one can offer some reason for not doing so. Some, however,\nwould not even demand that. All agree that there must be some relevant\ndifference between any two cases of which one wants to make different\njudgements.  Might it be enough to allow that there is some such\ndifference, even though one has no idea what it is? Or is one\nrationally required to be able to make some suggestion about what it\nis? Or is one\u2019s suggestion to be formulated as a possible principle\ngoverning all similar cases?  Particularists might be distinguished\nfrom generalists by their answer to these questions.\n",
