    "main_text": "Eastern Han (25\u2013220CE) || Ban Zhao and the Scholarship of Women\n3.3 Ban Zhao and the Scholarship of Women\n\nBan Zhao (c. 45\u2013116 CE) is an interesting figure in early\nChinese history for a number of reasons. The younger sister of the Han\ncourt historian Ban Gu and the grandniece of the famous concubine\nknown as Ban Jieyu (jieyu being a rank title) noted for her\nscholarship, Ban Zhao had an unusually scholarly upbringing for a\nwoman of the era. She became an important scholar of the period,\ncomposing numerous works on ethics, politics, history, and astronomy.\nHer most well-known works are the N\u00fcjie (Instructions\nfor Women), a guide to norms concerning virtue and conduct for women,\nand her completion of the official court history of the Western Han,\nthe Han Shu, after her brother Ban Gu died in prison in 92 CE\nbefore its completion.\n\nThe N\u00fcjie is a compendium of norms for women, social and\nmoral, in line with traditional Confucian views. One of these views\nwas that virtue was relative to role and position in society. Not only\nwould a virtuous ruler and a virtuous servant look different because\nof their different ways of manifesting particular kinds of virtue, but\nthe virtues exemplified by the virtuous ruler and servant were\ndifferent. There was a heavy focus in early Confucianism on roles\nconnected to relationships, with the central relationships in human\nlife being seen as those between parent and child, ruler and servant,\nand husband and wife\u2014part of the so-called \u201cFive\nRelationships\u201d (wu lun \u4e94\u502b). Ban\u2019s\nN\u00fcjie focused specifically on the virtues proper to the\nwoman as wife, that is, mainly in relationship to her\nhusband, and to a lesser extent toward her children. As with\ndiscussions of role norms for other individuals in Confucian texts,\nthe focus in the N\u00fcjie is very much on the\nresponsibilities of the wife toward the husband. The earlier Western\nHan author Liu Xiang\u2019s Lien\u00fc Zhuan\n(\u201cBiographies of Exemplary Women\u201d) contained many examples\nof virtuous women, including Ban Zhao\u2019s ancestor Ban Jieyu. It\nseems that despite the focus on presenting women as ideally\nsubordinate in key ways to men, particularly with respect to a\nhusband, there was no strict regulation against women engaging in\nscholarship. Indeed, Ban\u2019s description of her own situation and\nher motivation for writing the N\u00fcjie gives us a window\nonto the lives and expectations of women in the Eastern Han\nperiod:\n\n\n\u2026at the age of fourteen I was in charge of the work of dustpan\nand broom in the Cao family. Now, more than forty some years have\npassed; during these years, trembling with fear, I was constantly\nafraid that I may be dismissed or humiliated. Such an incident, if it\nhappened, would have brought disgrace upon my parents and burdened\nmembers of my husband\u2019s family, as well as my natal family.\n[\u2026] It grieves me to see you, my daughters, who have just\nreached the age of marriage, to not have been gradually taught more\nnor have you learned proper rituals of being a married woman.\n[\u2026] For this reason, I have composed the seven chapters of the\nN\u00fcjie. (Preface to N\u00fcjie, Pang-White\n[trans.] 2018: 41)\n\n\nWhile it is interesting and unique in the history of this period to\nsee women associated with scholarship as these two famous women of the\nBan family, the virtues of women according to these texts were very\ndifferent than those of men in most roles, with perhaps the exception\nof the role of subordinate to ruler. It is also important to note\nthat, while the responsibilities of women, according to texts like the\nNujie, tends to be other-directed in nature, most of the\nresponsibilities of men share these features as well. One has the\nresponsibility to subordinate oneself to people such as parents,\nsuperiors in society, and the ruler, whether man or woman. The end\ngoal of this is both social harmony and a good name, in terms of\ncontribution to overall harmony (N\u00fcjie 7, Pang-White\n[trans.] 2018: 64).\n\nAccording to Ban, humility is one of the main virtues women should aim\nto cultivate. Humility here is understood as \u201cputting others\nbefore oneself\u201d (xian ren hou ji\n\u5148\u4eba\u5f8c\u5df1). This seems to be an extension of\nthe view expressed in the Analects of Confucius (12.1), that\n\u201crestraining the self and returning to ritual\u201d is the key\nto developing virtue. Despite Ban\u2019s following of traditional\nnorms throughout the N\u00fcjie, there are certain passages\nwhere we see criticism of common practices of her society, including\nthe neglect of education of women and girls. She writes:\n\n\n\u2026only to educate men and not to educate women\u2014are they\nnot being partial in their treatment of the two sides? According to\nthe Liji, at the age of eight, children should begin\nreceiving instruction on the classics. At the age of fifteen, they\nshould receive an adult education. Why is women\u2019s education\nalone not following this as a principle? (N\u00fcjie 2,\nPang-White [trans.] 2018: 48)\n\n",
