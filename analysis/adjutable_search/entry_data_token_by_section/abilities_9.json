    "main_text": "Hypothetical theories of ability || The conditional analysis: some variations\n3.3 The conditional analysis: some variations\n\nThe guiding idea of hypothetical accounts is that abilities are to be\ndefined in terms of what someone would do were he in certain\npsychological conditions. There are a number of ways of developing\nthis idea that do not fit into the form of (CA). At least two such\nproposals deserve attention here.\n\nDonald Davidson takes concerns about the sufficiency of (CA),\nespecially as developed in Chisholm 1964, to tell decisively against\nit. More specifically, he takes the lesson of this problem to be is\nthat:\n\nThe antecedent of a causal conditional that attempts to analyze\n\u2018can\u2019 or \u2018could\u2019 or \u2018free to\u2019 must\nnot contain, as its dominant verb, a verb of action, or any verb\nwhich makes sense of the question, Can someone do it?\n(Davidson 1980, 68)\n\n\nDavidson suggests that we may overcome this difficulty at least by\nendorsing:\n\nA can do x intentionally (under the description\nd) means that if A has desires and beliefs that\nrationalize x (under d), then A does\nx. (Davidson 1980, 68)\n\n\nDavidson proceeds to consider a number of further problems for this\nproposal and for the causal theory of action generally, but he takes\nit to suffice at least to overcome standard objections to the\nsufficiency of (CA).\n\nThe trouble is that it is not at all clear it does so. For these\nobjections did not essentially depend on a verb of action figuring in\nthe antecedent of the analyzing conditional. Consider Lehrer\u2019s\ncase again. It seems true that if Lehrer\u2019s imagined agent\nhas desires and beliefs that rationalized that action under the\ndescription \u2018eating a red candy\u2019\u2014namely, adopting\nthe analysis of Davidson 1963, a desire for a red candy and a belief\nthat this action is a way of eating a red candy\u2014she would eat a\nred candy. But the trouble is precisely that, in virtue of her\npsychological disability, she is incapable of having this desire, and\nso cannot perform this action intentionally. For this reason it does\nnot seem that Davidson\u2019s proposal successfully overcomes the\nsufficiency problem, at least not on Lehrer\u2019s way of developing\nthat problem.\n\nA second and rather different approach to modifying (CA) has been\ntaken in recent work by Christopher Peacocke. Peacocke accepts that\n(CA) is insufficient in light of counterexamples like Lehrer\u2019s.\nBut he argues that we might supplement (CA) in order to\novercome these difficulties. In the terms of the present discussion,\nPeacocke\u2019s proposal is: S has the ability to A\njust in case: (i) (CA) is true of S and (ii) the\npossibility in which S tries to A is a\n\u2018close\u2019 one. The closeness of a possibility as it figures\nin (ii) is to be understood, at first pass, in terms of what we can\nreasonably rely on: a possibility is a distant one just in\ncase we can reasonably rely on it not obtaining; otherwise it is a\nclose one (Peacocke 1999, 310). To modify one of Peacocke\u2019s\nexamples, the possibility of toxic fumes being released into a train\ncar that is safely insulated is a distant one; on the other hand, the\npossibility of toxic fumes being released into a train car where they\njust happen to be blocked by a fortuitous arrangement of luggage is a\nclose one.\n\nPeacocke\u2019s thought is that this suffices to overcome the\nsufficiency objection: though Lehrer\u2019s agent satisfies (i), she\ndoes not satisfy (ii): given the facts about his psychology, the\npossibility that he tries to A is not a close one. The\ntrouble, however, is that Peacocke\u2019s proposal is subject to\nmodified versions of Lehrer\u2019s counterexample. Consider an agent\nwhose aversion to red candies is not a permanent feature of her\npsychology, but an unpredictable and temporary \u2018mood\u2019.\nConsider the agent at some time when she is in her aversive mood. This\nagent satisfies (i), for the same reason as above, and she also\nsatisfies (ii): given the fragility of her mood, the possibility of\nher trying is a close one in the relevant sense. Yet such an agent\nlacks the ability to eat a red candy, in precisely the same way as she\ndoes in Lehrer\u2019s original example.\n\nIt is an interesting question how we might develop other\n\u2018supplementation\u2019 strategies for (CA) (such strategies are\nalso suggested by Ginet 1980), though the track record of this method\nof analysis in other domains (for instance, the project of\n\u2018supplementing\u2019 the analysis of knowledge in terms of\njustified true belief, in response to (Gettier 1963)) does not inspire\nconfidence.\n",
