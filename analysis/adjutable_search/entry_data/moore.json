    "main_text": "\n1. Life and Career\n\n\nMoore grew up in South London (his eldest brother was the poet T.\nSturge Moore who worked as an illustrator with W. B. Yeats). In 1892 he\nwent to Trinity College Cambridge to study Classics. He soon made the\nacquaintance there of Bertrand Russell who was two years ahead of him\nand of J. M. E. McTaggart who was then a charismatic young Philosophy\nFellow of Trinity College. Under their encouragement Moore decided to\nadd the study of Philosophy to his study of Classics, and he graduated\nin 1896 with a First Class degree in the subject. At this point he\nturned his energies towards attempting to follow in the footsteps of\nMcTaggart and Russell by winning a \u2018Prize\u2019 Fellowship at\nTrinity College which would enable him to continue the study of\nphilosophy there. In 1898 he was successful and over the next six years\nhe matured as a dynamic young philosopher, actually leading Russell\naway from the idealist philosophy of McTaggart and others which was\nthen dominant in Britain.\n\n\nMoore's Fellowship ended in 1904; after a spell away from Cambridge,\nMoore returned there in 1911 to a lectureship in the University and he\nthen lived there for the rest of his life (apart from an extended visit\nto the U.S.A. in 1940-44). In 1921 he became editor of Mind,\nthe leading British philosophical journal, and in 1925 he became a\nProfessor at Cambridge. These two appointments confirmed his position\nas the most highly respected British philosopher of the time, and with\nWittgenstein back in Cambridge after 1929, Cambridge became the most\nimportant centre of philosophy in the world. Moore retired as Professor\nin 1939 (to be succeeded by Wittgenstein) and as editor of\nMind in 1944; these retirements marked not only the end of his\npre-eminence, but also of the golden age of Cambridge philosophy.\n\n\nEarly in his time in Cambridge Moore became friends with some of the\nyoung men who went on to form the \u2018Bloomsbury Group\u2019, such\nas Lytton Strachey, Leonard Woolf and Maynard Keynes. Through these\nfriendships Moore exerted an indirect influence on British\ntwentieth-century culture as profound as that of any more\n\u2018engaged\u2019 philosopher. These long-lasting friendships bear\nwitness to Moore's Socratic personality and thus to a side of his\ncharacter which his writings do not convey. Gilbert Ryle, the Oxford\nphilosopher who was Moore's successor both as editor of Mind\nand as the dominant British philosopher after 1945, emphasized this\nside of Moore's personality:\nHe gave us courage not by making concessions, but by making\nno concessions to our youth or our shyness. He treated us as corrigible\nand therefore as responsible thinkers. He would explode at our mistakes\nand muddles with just that genial ferocity with which he would explode\nat the mistakes and muddles of philosophical high-ups, and with just\nthe genial ferocity with which he would explode at mistakes and muddles\nof his own. (Ryle 270)\n2. The Refutation of Idealism\n\n\nMoore was first drawn to philosophy through contact with McTaggart\nand under McTaggart's influence he fell briefly under the spell of\nBritish idealism, especially the work of F. H. Bradley. Thus when in\n1897 he made his first attempt to win a Prize Fellowship at Trinity he\nsubmitted a dissertation on \u2018The Metaphysical Basis of\nEthics\u2019 in which he acknowledges his indebtedness to Bradley and\npresents an idealist ethical theory. One element of this theory is what\nhe calls \u2018the fallacy involved in all empirical definitions of\nthe good\u2019, which is immediately recognisable as a precursor of\nhis famous claim in Principia Ethica that there is a fallacy,\nthe \u2018naturalistic fallacy\u2019, in all naturalistic definitions\nof goodness. This point indicates that although, as we shall see below,\nMoore quickly came to reject the idealist philosophy of Bradley and\nMcTaggart, he held that their criticisms of empiricism, as represented\nby J. S. Mill's philosophy, were sound and he carried this hostility to\nempiricism forward into his mature philosophy. In this respect,\ntherefore, his early idealist enthusiasm had an enduring impact on his\nthought.\n\n\nA substantial part of this early dissertation is devoted to a\ncritical discussion of Kant's moral philosophy, and it is striking that\nalthough in his general approach and conclusions Moore endorses the\nkind of idealism advanced by Bradley, he is already critical of Kant's\nconception of practical reason. He argues that Kant's use of this\nconception blurs the distinction between \u2018the psychological\nfaculty of making judgments and inferences\u2019 and that which is\n\u2018true and objective\u2019. This distinction, Moore maintains,\n\u2018cannot be either done away or bridged over\u2019. Hence, he\nargues, Kant's conception of morality as founded on a priori\nprinciples of practical reason is untenable. It is easy to see how this\nline of thought could be extended to a general criticism of Kant's\nconception of the a priori; and it is precisely this\ngeneralisation that Moore undertakes in his successful 1898\ndissertation. At the same time he comes to see that his previous\nenthusiasm for Bradley's idealism was not well founded (though it still\ntakes him a little time to accept that the arguments of Bradley and\nMcTaggart against the reality of time are flawed). So it is in this\n1898 dissertation that Moore turns decisively against idealist\nphilosophy, both in its Kantian and Bradleian forms.\n\n\nThere are several aspects to this. As I have indicated, he rejects\nKant's conception of the a priori as a muddled form of\nsubjectivism or psychologism. The following passage from Principia\nEthica (1903) is indicative of his polemic which can be found in\nmany of his writings of this period:\nThat \u2018to be true\u2019 means\u00a0 to be\nthought in a certain way is, therefore, certainly false. Yet this\nassertion plays the most central part in Kant's \u2018Copernical\nRevolution\u2019 of philosophy, and renders worthless the whole mass\nof modern literature, to which that revolution has given rise, and\nwhich is called Epistemology. (Principia Ethica\n183)\n\n\nThe distinction Moore is drawing on here between thought on the one\nhand and what is objective or real on the other is one that runs\nthrough his critique of idealism. An important early context in which\nhe elaborates it is his discussion of meaning in his famous paper\n\u2018The Nature of Judgement\u2019 (1899), which comes largely from\nhis 1898 Dissertation. Moore begins here by attributing to Bradley a\nquasi-empiricist view of meaning as abstracted from the total content\nof judgement. This is a mistake, but what is important is what follows:\nas against this view Moore holds that meanings, which he calls\n\u2018concepts\u2019, are entirely non-psychological. They come\ntogether in propositions, which are the \u2018objects\u2019 of\nthoughts and, as such, are to be sharply distinguished from any mental\ncontents or representations. Indeed true propositions do not represent\nor correspond to a fact or real state of affairs; instead they just are\nfacts. He put this point very clearly in a short entry written a year\nlater on \u2018Truth\u2019:\nit seems plain that a truth differs in no respect from the\nreality to which it was supposed merely to correspond: e.g. the truth\nthat I exist differs in no respect from the corresponding reality\n\u2014 my existence. So far, indeed, from truth being defined by\nreference to reality, reality can only be defined by reference to\ntruth. (\u2018Truth\u2019 21)\n\n\nAs Moore came to see ten years later, this radical metaphysics of\ntrue propositions is too simple. But in the present context what is\nstriking about it is the way in which by itself it hovers between\nidealism and realism. If propositions are thought of as contents of\njudgment, then to hold that reality just comprises true propositions is\nto take an idealist stance. What makes the position realist in Moore's\nhands is his uncompromising realism concerning propositions and\nconcepts: although they are possible objects of thought, Moore writes,\n\u2018that is no definition of them\u2019; for \u2018it is\nindifferent to their nature whether anybody thinks them or not\u2019\n(\u2018The Nature of Judgment\u2019 4)\n\n\nMoore's most famous criticisms of idealism are contained in his\npaper \u2018The Refutation of Idealism\u2019 (1903). The basic theme\nof this paper is the extension to sense-experience of the strong\ndistinction between the mind and its objects which we have encountered\nin connection with meaning. Moore concentrates here on the case of a\n\u2018sensation of blue\u2019 and maintains that this experience is a\nkind of \u2018diaphanous\u2019 consciousness or awareness of blue,\nwhich is not a \u2018content\u2019 of experience at all, but\nsomething real whose existence is not dependent on experience. His\nargument here is in part phenomenological: \u2018when we try to\nintrospect the sensation of blue, all we can see is the blue\u2019\n(41); but he also argues that to suppose otherwise, that the\n\u2018blue\u2019 is merely a content of the experience is to suppose\nthat it is a quality of the experience, so that the experience is blue\nin much the way in which a blue bead is blue, which he takes to be\nabsurd. Not surprisingly Moore's critics were not happy with this\ncomparison, but it was not until the formulation of the\n\u2018adverbial\u2019 theory of experience by Ducasse in the 1940's,\naccording to which someone who has a sensation of blue is someone who\n\u2018senses bluely\u2019, that there was a reasonably robust\nresponse to Moore's criticism. What is, nonetheless, odd about Moore's\npaper is that he makes no attempt to address the famous \u2018argument\nfrom illusion\u2019. Moore concludes that \u2018\u201cblue\u201d is\nas much an object, and as little a mere content, of my experience, when\nI experience it, as the most exalted and independent real thing of\nwhich I am ever aware\u2019 (42). As he was soon to realise, more\nneeds to be said to handle cases in which something which is not in\nfact blue looks blue.\n\n\nThe final aspect of Moore's critical response to idealism concerns\nhis rejection of the monism which was characteristic of British\nidealism. This is the holistic thesis that ordinary things are\nessentially inter-related in such an intimate way that they constitute\ntogether an \u2018organic unity\u2019 which is, in a sense, the only\nthing that \u2018really\u2019 exists, since it is the only thing\nwhose existence is not dependent on the existence of anything else.\nThis thesis is especially characteristic of Bradley's idealism,\naccording to which the Absolute is the one real thing. In his early\nwritings and in Principia Ethica Moore engages in a good deal\nof polemical criticism of this thesis, but it is hard to find any\narguments against it, as opposed to a robust affirmation of a realist\npluralism. Rather later, however, in his paper \u2018External and\nInternal Relations\u2019 (written in 1919) Moore focused on the\nidealist conception of internal relations which lies at the heart of\nthe monist thesis. Moore's argument against the thesis that all\nrelations are internal starts from the claim that the burden of proof\nlies on its supporters since it conflicts with our common sense\nconviction that things are not essentially inter-related in such a way\nthat a change to one thing in one respect necessitates changes to\neverything else. Moore then argues that the best reason one could have\nfor the thesis involves a logical fallacy; he shows how the thesis that\nall relations are internal might be plausibly, but fallaciously,\ninferred from Leibniz\u2019 Law, the uncontentious principle that things\nwhich differ in their relations must differ in their identity.\nSimplifying a bit, and using Moore's concept of entailment (see below),\nhis argument runs as follows:\n\nLeibniz\u2019 Law states that \n\nxRy entails (z = x \u2192\nzRy),\n\n\nwhere \u2018\u2192\u2019 is the truth-functional conditional\nSince entailment is a necessary connection, one might infer \n\nxRy \u2192 Necessarily (z = x \u2192\nzRy)\n\nFrom (2) one can immediately infer \n\nxRy \u2192 Necessarily (x = x \u2192\nxRy)\n\nSince x = x is itself a necessary truth, one can now infer\n\nxRy \u2192 Necessarily (xRy)\n\n\nwhich expresses the thesis that all relations are internal.\n\n\n\nSo, on the face of it, this thesis has here been inferred from\nLeibniz\u2019 Law. Moore observes, however, that the step from (1) to (2) is\ninvalid; it confuses the necessity of a connection with the necessity\nof the consequent. In ordinary language this distinction is not clearly\nmarked, although it is easy to draw it with a suitable formal\nlanguage.\n\n\nMoore's argument here is a sophisticated piece of informal modal\nlogic; but whether it really gets to the heart of the motivation for\nBradley's Absolute idealism can be doubted. My own view is that\nBradley's dialectic rests on a different thesis about the inadequacy of\nthought as a representation of reality, and thus that one has to dig\nrather deeper into Bradley's idealist metaphysics both to extract the\ngrounds for his monism and to exhibit what is wrong with it.\n3. Principia Ethica\n\n\nThe main achievement of Moore's early period is his book\nPrincipia Ethica. It was published in 1903 but was the\nculmination of the reflections which Moore commenced in his 1897\ndissertation on \u2018The Metaphysical basis of Ethics\u2019. The\nmain impetus, however, came from a series of lectures in London on\n\u2018The Elements of Ethics\u2019 which Moore gave late in 1898.\nMoore had the text of these lectures typed up with a view to publishing\nthem; but as his thoughts progressed he reworked his text and\nPrincipia Ethica is the result of this reworking (the lectures\nhave recently been published as The Elements of Ethics). Most\nof the first three chapters come from the 1898 lectures; whereas the\nlast three chapters are largely new material.\n\n\nIn the first three chapters Moore sets out his criticisms of\n\u2018ethical naturalism\u2019. At the core of these criticisms is\nthe thesis that the position involves a fallacy, the\n\u2018naturalistic fallacy\u2019, of supposing that goodness, which\nMoore takes to be the fundamental ethical value, can be defined in\nnaturalistic terms, in terms, say, of pleasure or desire or the course\nof evolution. As against all such claims Moore insists that goodness is\nindefinable, or unanalysable, and thus that ethics is an autonomous\nscience, irreducible to natural science or, indeed, to metaphysics.\nMoore's main argument against the possibility of any such definition of\ngoodness is that when we confront a putative definition, such as that\nto be good is to be something which we desire to desire, we can tell\nthat this is not a claim that is true by definition because its truth\nremains for us an \u2018open question\u2019 in the sense that it\nremains sensible to doubt it in a way which would not be possible if it\nwere just a definition which makes explicit our understanding of the\nwords. The merits of this argument are questionable; in many cases we\ncan sensibly doubt the truth of a definition, especially where the\ndefinition makes use of discoveries that have not been part of our\nordinary understanding, as is normally the case with definitions in the\nnatural sciences. But there is, I think, a way of modifying Moore's\nargument which takes it around this objection, namely by taking it to\nrest on the epistemological thesis that ethical questions cannot be\nanswered without the explicit involvement of ethical beliefs. The\nreason that this thesis is inimical to naturalistic definitions of\nethical values is that an important role of definitions in the natural\nsciences and elsewhere is that they enable one to answer questions in\nnew ways that would not otherwise be possible: it is thanks to the\ndefinition of water as H2O, and not in terms of its familiar\nphenotype, that we can be confident that some comets are mainly\ncomposed of water. But there is no way in which we would accept that\nthe answer to a novel ethical question, for example concerning the\nacceptability of the use of human embryos for stem cell research, is to\nbe found by finding a definition of ethical values which enables us to\nanswer this question without drawing on beliefs that are expressed with\nthe familiar ethical \u2018phenotype\u2019, i.e., explicitly ethical\nconcepts.\n\n\nThis defence of Moore's argument does not address a different\nconcern, namely that the argument applies only to versions of ethical\nnaturalism which involve a definition of ethical value, and thus that\nnaturalist positions which maintain that ethical value is an\nirreducible natural property are not touched by the argument. Moore's\nargument against positions of this kind rests on the claim that the\nethical value of a situation is not a feature of it which is\nindependent of its other properties; on the contrary it depends on its\nother properties. As he puts it in the preface he composed for the\nsecond edition of Principia Ethica, but never actually\npublished, a thing's \u2018intrinsic value\u2019 depends on its\n\u2018intrinsic nature\u2019, and he glosses this dependence in terms\nof the relationship which we now call \u2018supervenience\u2019\n(though Moore does not use the term): things with the same intrinsic\nnature, or natural properties, must have the same intrinsic value (see\n\u2018The Conception of Intrinsic Value\u2019 286). Moore took it\nthat supervenience was not an inherently reductive relationship, and\nthus that it was consistent for him to hold that goodness is not a\nnatural property even though it supervenes upon natural properties;\nbut, he assumed, if one takes the view that goodness is itself a\nnatural property, the fact that it supervenes upon other natural\nproperties makes it impossible to avoid a reductive thesis. So the\nsupervenience of intrinsic value removes the option of a non-reductive\nnaturalism without contradicting his version of ethical\nnon-naturalism.\n\n\nSubsequent discussion has shown that the relationship between\nsupervenience and reduction is a complicated matter, and though I think\nthat Moore's position is defensible this is not the place to take the\nissue further. Instead I want to turn to the concept of intrinsic value\nwhich is central to Moore's theory. One aspect of this is easy, namely\nthe distinction between the \u2018intrinsic\u2019 value of a\nsituation and its \u2018instrumental\u2019 value: this is the\ndistinction between the value inherent in a situation and that which\ndepends only on the situation's consequences. Despite this distinction\nit remains the case that intrinsic value is the fundamental type of\nethical value, since instrumental value is definable in terms of the\nintrinsic value of a situation's consequences. But intrinsic value is\nnot merely non-instrumental value; for it is also to be distinguished\nfrom what Moore calls the \u2018value as a part\u2019 of a situation,\nnamely the extra contribution which the situation makes to the value of\na complex situation of which it is a \u2018part\u2019, over and above\nits intrinsic value. This is not a conception which is familiar to us,\nbut Moore illustrates the point by the following case: although\nknowledge has little intrinsic value, the value of the aesthetic\nappreciation of a beautiful work of art (which is, according to Moore,\npotentially one of the most valuable things there is) is greatly\nenhanced by knowledge about it. So this kind of knowledge can have a\nsubstantial \u2018value as a part\u2019 even though it has little\nintrinsic value. As before intrinsic value remains the fundamental\nconception of value, since a situation's value as a part is defined in\nterms of the overall intrinsic value of a complex situation to which it\nmakes a contribution beyond its own intrinsic value. Nonetheless this\npoint implies that a thing's intrinsic value is not simply its value\nirrespective of its consequences; it is also its value irrespective of\nits context. Hence the concept of intrinsic value is to be such that a\ntype of situation has the same intrinsic value in all contexts \u2014\nwhich is why Moore holds that its intrinsic value depends only on its\n\u2018intrinsic nature\u2019.\n\n\nThere are two connected problems here: the first concerns the way in\nwhich something's \u2018value as a part\u2019 depends on accepting\nthat when it occurs as an element of a complex situation it may affect\nthe latter's value in a way which is not simply the result of taking\nits intrinsic value into account. This judgement is enshrined by Moore\nin his \u2018principle of organic unities\u2019, which declares that\nthis kind of non-aggregative valuation of complex situations is liable\nto occur. The problem here is not that Moore's principle is incorrect,\nbut rather that it seems irrational since it puts a block on moral\nreasoning. The second problem concerns the thesis that intrinsic value\nis the same in all contexts. For this just seems wrong, in that the\nvalue of, say, friendship differs from one context to another.\nAlthough, as Moore rightly says, friendship is normally one of the most\nvaluable things there is, it has no value at all where claims of\njustice are at stake, as in a court of law. So Moore's conception of\nabsolutely universal intrinsic values should be replaced by a\nconception which allows for the \u2018bracketing\u2019 of normal\nvalues in certain contexts; and once this is in place, along with a\nmore sophisticated account of normative values than Moore provides, it\nis reasonable to hope that the phenomena captured by Moore's irrational\nprinciple of organic unities will find a more comprehensible\ninterpretation.\n\n\nAnother area where Moore's ethical theory is problematic is his\naccount of ethical knowledge. Because of his hostility to ethical\nnaturalism Moore denies that ethical knowledge is a matter of empirical\nenquiry. But, as we have seen, he is equally hostile to Kant's\nrationalist thesis that fundamental ethical truths are truths of\nreason. Instead he holds that ethical knowledge rests on a capacity for\nan intuitive grasp of fundamental ethical truths for which we can give\nno reason since there is no reason to be given. The trouble with this\nis that if we can say nothing to support a claim to such knowledge,\nthose who disagree with it can only register their disagreement and\npass on; hence ethical debate is liable to turn into the expression of\nconflicting judgements which admit of no resolution. In the light of\nthis, it is not surprising that Moore's ethical theory was regarded as\nundermining the cognitive status of morality, and thus that it led\ndirectly to the development of ethical non-cognitivism by those who\nwere influenced by Moore, such as A. J. Ayer and C. L. Stevenson. Yet\nthere was another side to Moore's discussion of ethical issues, in\nwhich he found himself arguing against the hedonist thesis that\npleasure is the only thing with positive intrinsic value, despite the\nfact that officially he held that no such arguments could be given.\nWhen engaged in this kind of \u2018indirect\u2019 method of argument,\nMoore sees himself as seeking to obtain agreement rather than to\nestablish the truth, though he also acknowledges that from a\nfirst-person point of view there is little difference here. Because\nthis indirect method is not integrated into his official method of\nethical inquiry, he says little about its presuppositions. But it seems\nto me that one can find here the beginnings of a \u2018common\nsense\u2019 approach to ethics which is distinctly preferable to his\nofficial appeal to intuitive judgments concerning the relative\nintrinsic value of situations of arbitrary complexity.\n\n\nSo far I have discussed Moore's \u2018metaethics\u2019, his views\nabout the metaphysics of ethical value and the nature of ethical\nknowledge. This emphasis reflects the fact that this aspect of Moore's\nethical theory has been most influential; but it is also worth\nmentioning briefly some points from his moral theory. Moore presents a\nstraightforward consequentialist account of the relationship between\nthe right and the good: the right action is that which will produce the\nbest outcome. In practice, because it is so difficult for us to\ndetermine by ourselves what is the best outcome, he allows that we\nprobably do best if we follow established rules; thus Moore ends up\nrecommending a conservative form of rule consequentialism, for which he\nwas criticised by Keynes and Russell. Later critics such as W. D. Ross\nargued that because Moore subjects our personal responsibilities to the\nimpersonal test of producing the best outcome his position does not\nadequately capture the way in which they arise from our relationships\nwith particular people; as recent critics put it, Moore's moral theory\nis resolutely \u2018agent-neutral\u2019 and for that reason\ninadequate as an account of the personal responsibilities which involve\nirreducibly \u2018agent-relative\u2019 values.\n\n\nFinally, in the last chapter of Principia Ethica,Moore sets\nout his \u2018ideal\u2019 \u2014 a deliberately unsystematic list of\nintrinsic goods (such as friendship and the appreciation of beauty) and\nintrinsic evils (such as consciousness of pain). Moore's choice of\nvalues is striking: it connects with the \u2018Bloomsbury\u2019 ideal\nof life devoted to Art and Love, and excludes social values such as\nequality and freedom. The individualism of the resulting morality is\nenhanced by the fact that Moore maintains that these intrinsic values\nare incommensurable, and thus that the assessment of priorities among\nthem is inescapably a matter of individual judgment. As Keynes put it,\nMoore's ideal was a kind of secular \u2018religion\u2019 - not much\nuse for public policy but fine for talented individuals who could agree\nto differ in their detailed value judgments.\n4. Philosophical Analysis\n\n\nBy the time Moore returned to Cambridge in 1911 to a lectureship\nthere, Russell\u00a0 and Whitehead were finishing off their massive\nproject of exhibiting the logical foundations of mathematics \u2014\nPrincipia Mathematica. Although Moore was neither a\nmathematician nor a logical theorist he was one of the first people to\ngrasp that Russell's new logical theory was an essential tool for\nphilosophy and offered important new insights. One example of this\nconcerns the status of propositions, the \u2018objects\u2019 of\nthought. As we saw above, in his early work Moore had been emphatic\nthat propositions are altogether independent of thought and had even\nproposed that facts are just true propositions. But as he came to think\nmore about falsehood in his lectures Some Main Problems of\nPhilosophy of 1910\u201311, it became clear to him that this\nposition was a mistake, since the truth of a proposition should not\naffect its\u00a0 ontological status and yet it would be absurd to give\nfalse propositions the status of facts. So he now rejected the view\nthat facts are just true propositions. On his new view, facts are, as\nbefore, constituted by objects and their properties; but what about\npropositions? According to Moore, philosophers talk legitimately of\npropositions in order to identify the aspects of thought and language\nwhich are crucial to questions of truth and inference, and in doing so\nit may appear that they regard propositions as genuine entities. But,\nMoore now holds, this implication is unwarranted: the mistake here is\none of supposing that \u2018every expression which seems to be a name\nof something must be so in fact\u2019 (Some Main Problems of\nPhilosophy, 266). Moore does not allude here explicitly to\nRussell's theory of incomplete symbols and logical fictions, but it is\nclear that this is the kind of position he has in mind. The new logic\nenables one to preserve realist appearances without accepting realist\nmetaphysics.\n\n\nYet Moore was not an uncritical follower of Russell. He was critical\nof Russell's account of implication in which Russell proposes that the\ntruth-functional conditional expresses all there is to the logical\nrelationship of implication between propositions, and introduced\ninstead the term \u2018entailment\u2019 for this latter relationship\n(\u2018External and Internal Relations\u2019 90ff.). While\nrecognising that entailment is closely connected to logical necessity\nhe came to think that entailment is not just a matter of the necessity\nof the truth-functional conditional, thereby setting off a debate about\nthis relationship which continues to this day. Again, Moore was\ncritical of Russell's treatment of existence, in particular his denial\nthat it makes sense to treat existence as a first-order predicate of\nparticular objects (for Russell, existence has to be expressed by the\nexistential quantifier and is therefore a second-order predicate of\npredicates). While agreeing with Russell that existence is not a\nstraightforward first-order predicate (so that the logical form of\n\u2018Tame tigers exist\u2019 is not the same as that of \u2018Tame\ntigers growl\u2019), Moore argued that statements such as \u2018This\nmight not exist\u2019 make perfectly good sense and that they could\nnot do so unless the simpler statement \u2018This exists\u2019 also\nmakes sense (\u2018Is Existence a Predicate?\u2019 145).\n\n\nMoore's uses of Russell's logic take place in the broader context of\nhis use of analysis as a method of philosophy. Although Moore always\ndenied that philosophy is just analysis, there is no denying that it\nplays a central role in his philosophy and it is therefore important to\ndetermine what motivates this role. This question is especially\npressing in Moore's case because he rejected the main analytical\nprogrammes of twentieth century philosophy \u2014 both Wittgenstein's\nlogical atomism and the logical empiricism of the members of the Vienna\ncircle and their followers such as A. J. Ayer. In the first case, Moore\nrejected Wittgenstein's thesis that whatever exists exists necessarily;\nas with the idealist thesis that all relations are internal, Moore held\nthat our common sense conviction that some of the things which exist\nmight not have done so creates a strong presumption against any\nphilosopher who maintains the opposite, and that the logical atomist\nposition does not provide convincing reasons why this presumption\nshould be overturned. In addition Moore held that it is just not true\nthat all necessity is logical necessity, as Wittgenstein maintained; in\nhis early writings, despite his hostility to Kant, he had explicitly\ndefended the conception of necessary synthetic truths and he did not\nchange his mind on this point. This point also provides a reason for\nhis rejection of logical empiricism, since this position famously\nincludes the thesis that all necessary truths are\n\u2018analytic\u2019. But Moore also recognised that his early\ncriticisms of William James' pragmatism can be applied to the logical\nempiricist position. In connection with James, Moore had observed that\nwhere a proposition concerns the past, it may well be that we are in a\nsituation in which a proposition and its negation are both unverifiable\nbecause there is now no evidence either way on the matter. But, he\nargued, it does not follow that we cannot now affirm that either the\nproposition or its negation is true, thanks to the Law of Excluded\nMiddle; in which case it cannot be that truth is verifiability \u2014\ncontrary both to James' pragmatism and to logical empiricism.\n\n\nYet why then did Moore think that the analysis of propositions was\nso important? In part his motivation derives from his acceptance of a\nprinciple which Russell had introduced \u2014 that \u2018every\nproposition which we can understand must be composed wholly of\nconstituents with which we are acquainted\u2019 (Russell 91). For this\nprinciple motivates the \u2018sense-datum analysis\u2019 of\nperception to which he devoted so much attention and which I shall\ndiscuss in a moment. In addition, when explaining the importance of\nphilosophical analysis, he emphasized the importance of getting clear\nwhat is at issue in some debate; but an issue which he himself was not\nclear about was that of the implications of an analysis. In his early\nwritings he took the view that in so far as the analysis of a\nproposition clarifies it, it also clarifies its ontological\nimplications; thus he then held it to be an objection to a\nphenomenalist analysis of propositions about material objects that the\nanalysis calls into question the existence of such objects. But he\nlater took the opposite point of view, maintaining that a phenomenalist\nanalysis just provides an account of what their existence amounts to.\nIn between these two positions, in his 1925 paper \u2018A Defence of\nCommon Sense\u2019 (which I discuss further below), Moore had held\nthat what the sense-datum analysis of perception shows is that\nsense-data are the \u2018principal or ultimate subject<s>\u2019\n(128) of propositions about perception. This remark, I think, reflects\nthe true importance of philosophical analysis for Moore: its importance\nfor him is metaphysical in so far as it reveals the\n\u2018ultimate\u2019 substances which are the subjects of our\nordinary common sense thought and talk.\n5. Perception and Sense-data\n\n\nIt did not take Moore long to realise that the realist position he\nhad advanced in \u2018The Refutation of Idealism\u2019 was too\n\u2018na\u2022ve\u2019 to be tenable; he had to be able to\naccommodate \u2018false\u2019 appearances somehow. But the strategy\nMoore adopted to deal with this remained true to the basic thesis of\n\u2018The Refutation of Idealism\u2019 that one should account for\nthe appearances of things in terms of the properties of the primary\nobjects of experience, and not the qualities of experiences themselves.\nTo elaborate this position Moore introduced the term\n\u2018sense-datum\u2019 to describe these primary objects of\nexperience:\nBut now, what happened to each of us, when we saw that\nenvelope? I will begin by describing part of what happened to\nme. I saw a patch of a particular whitish colour, having a certain\nshape \u2026. These things: this patch of a whitish colour, and its\nsize and shape I did actually see. And I propose to call these things,\nthe colour and size and shape, sense-data \u2026 (Some\nMain Problems of Philosophy 30)\n\n\nMoore implies here that the colour, shape and size are distinct\nsense-data; but he soon revised his terminology so that these are\nregarded as properties of the visual sense-datum he \u2018actually\nsaw\u2019, or \u2018directly apprehended\u2019 as he normally\nsays.\n\n\nOnce the concept of a sense-datum has been introduced in this way,\nit is easy to see that false appearances can be handled by\ndistinguishing between the properties of sense-data we apprehend and\nthe properties of the physical objects which give rise to these\nsense-data. But what is the relationship between sense-data and\nphysical objects? Moore took it that there are three serious candidates\nto be considered: (i) an indirect realist position, according to which\nsense-data are non-physical but somehow produced by interactions\nbetween physical objects and our senses; (ii) the phenomenalist\nposition, according to which our conception of physical objects is\nmerely one which expresses observed and anticipated uniformities among\nthe sense-data we apprehend; (iii) a direct realist position, according\nto which sense-data are parts of physical objects \u2014 so that, for\nexample, visual sense-data are visible parts of the surfaces of\nphysical objects. The indirect realist position is that to which he was\ninitially drawn; but he could see that it leaves our beliefs about the\nphysical world exposed to skeptical doubt, since it implies that the\nobservations which constitute evidence for these beliefs concern only\nthe properties of non-physical sense-data, and there is no obvious way\nfor us to obtain further evidence to support a hypothesis about the\nproperties of the physical world and its relationship to our\nsense-data. This argument is reminiscent of Berkeley's critique of\nLocke, and Moore therefore considered carefully Berkeley's\nphenomenalist alternative. Moore's initial response to this position\nwas that the implied conception of the physical world was just too\n\u2018pickwickian\u2019 to be believable. This may be felt to be too\nintuitive, like Dr. Johnson's famous objection to Berkeley; but Moore\ncould also see that there were substantive objections to the\nphenomenalist position, such as the fact that our normal ways of\nidentifying and anticipating significant uniformities among our\nsense-data draw on our beliefs about our location in physical space and\nthe state of our physical sense-organs, neither of which are available\nto the consistent phenomenalist.\n\n\nSo far Moore's dialectic is familiar. What is unfamiliar is his\ndirect realist position, according to which sense-data are physical.\nThis position avoids the problems so far encountered, but in order to\naccommodate false appearances Moore has to allow that sense-data may\nlack the properties which we apprehend them as having. It may be felt\nthat in so far as sense-data are objects at all, this is inevitable;\nbut Moore now needs to provide an account of the apparent properties of\nsense-data and it is not clear how he can do this without going back on\nthe initial motivation for the sense-datum theory by construing these\napparent properties as properties of our experiences. But what in fact\nturns Moore against this direct realist position is the difficulty he\nthinks it leads to concerning the treatment of hallucinations. In such\ncases, Moore holds, any sense-data we apprehend are not parts of a\nphysical object; so direct realism cannot apply to them, and yet there\nis no reason to hold that they are intrinsically different from the\nsense-data which we apprehend in normal experience. This last point\nmight well be disputed, and at one point Moore himself considers the\npossibility of a distinction between \u2018subjective\u2019 and\n\u2018objective\u2019 sense-data; but once one has introduced\nsense-data in the first place as the primary objects of experience it\nis not going to be easy to make a distinction here without assuming\nmore about experience than Moore at any rate would have wanted to\nconcede.\n\n\nMoore wrote more extensively about perception than about any other\ntopic. In these writings he moves between the three alternatives set\nout here without coming to any firm conclusion. From the outside, it\nseems clear that what was leading him astray was the sense-datum\nhypothesis itself and his reflections on perception can be regarded as\nan extended reductio ad absurdum of this hypothesis. It was\nonly towards the end of his career that he encountered in Ducasse's\nadverbial theory a serious alternative to the sense-datum hypothesis.\nBut the adverbial theory provides no easy way of avoiding the\ndifficulties Moore confronted: Moore rightly objected to Ducasse that\nit is not at all clear how the structure of a sensory field can be\nconstrued in adverbial terms. Yet there were other alternatives: in\nparticular, from the start of the twentieth century the\nphenomenological movement had offered an account of perception based\nupon a recognition of its inherent intentionality which avoids some of\nthe pitfalls of the sense-datum theory. It is, I think, a pity that\nMoore did not engage with this position, but this detachment was all\ntoo characteristic of the relationship at the time between the\nanalytical and phenomenological traditions.\n6. Common Sense and Certainty\n\n\nAn important aspect of Moore's rejection of idealism was his\naffirmation of a \u2018common sense\u2019 realist position, according\nto which our ordinary common-sense view of the world is largely\ncorrect. Moore first explicitly championed this position in his 1910-11\nlectures Some Main Problems of Philosophybut he made it his\nown when he responded in 1925 to an invitation to describe his\n\u2018philosophical position\u2019 by setting this out as \u2018A\nDefence of Common Sense\u2019. Moore begins the paper by listing a\nlarge number of \u2018truisms\u2019 such as that \u2018the earth had\nexisted also for many years before my body was born\u2019. Concerning\nthese truisms he then asserts, first, that he knows them for certain,\nsecond, that other people likewise know for certain the truth of\ncomparable truisms about themselves and, third, that he knows this\nsecond general truth (and, by implication, others do too). So the truth\nand general knowledge of these truisms is a matter of common sense.\nHaving set out these truisms, Moore then acknowledges that some\nphilosophers have denied their truth or, more commonly, denied our\nknowledge of them (even though, according to Moore, they also know\nthem) and he attempts to show that these denials are incoherent or\nunwarranted. These claims might seem to leave little space for radical\nphilosophical argument. But in the last part of the paper Moore argues\nthat his defence of common sense leaves completely undecided the\nquestion as to how the truistic propositions which make up the common\nsense view of the world are to be analysed; the analysis may be as\nradical as one likes as long as it is consistent with the truth and\nknowability of the propositions analysed. Thus, for example, he is\ncontent to allow that philosophical argument may show that a\nphenomenalist analysis of propositions about the physical world is\ncorrect.\n\n\nThis last point shows that Moore's defence of common sense is not as\nmuch of a constraint on philosophical theory as one might at first have\nthought; for philosophical analysis can reveal to us facts about the\n\u2018principal or ultimate subject\u2019 of a truistic proposition\nwhich are by no means what common sense supposes. This implication is\nimportant when one turns to consider Moore's most famous paper, his\n\u2018Proof of an External World\u2019 \u2014 the text of a British\nAcademy lecture delivered in 1939 just when Moore was retiring from his\nCambridge Professorship. Moore here sets himself the task of doing what\nKant had earlier set himself to do, namely providing a proof of the\nexistence of \u2018external objects\u2019. Much of the lecture is\ndevoted to working out what counts as an \u2018external object\u2019,\nand Moore claims that these are things whose existence is not dependent\nupon our experience. So, he argues, if he can prove the existence of\nany such things, then he will have proved the existence of an\n\u2018External World\u2019. Moore then maintains that he can do this\n\u2014\nHow? By holding up my two hands, and saying, as I make a\ncertain gesture with the right hand, \u2018Here is one hand\u2019,\nand adding, as I make a certain gesture with the left, \u2018and here\nis another\u2019 (\u2018Proof of an External World\u2019\n166).\n\n\nMoore then goes to argue that this demonstration of his hands was a\n\u2018perfectly rigorous\u2019 proof of the existence of external\nobjects. For its premises certainly entail its conclusion and they are\nthings which he then knew to be true \u2014\nI knew that there was one hand in the place\nindicated by combining a certain gesture with my first utterance of\n\u2018here\u2019 and that there was another in the different place\nindicated by combining a certain gesture with my second utterance of\n\u2018here\u2019. How absurd it would be to suggest that I did not\nknow it, but only believed it, and that perhaps it was not the case!\nYou might as well suggest that I do not know that I am now standing up\nand talking \u2014 that perhaps after all I'm not, and that it's not\nquite certain that I am! (\u2018Proof of an External World\u2019\n166)\n\n\nThe significance of this performance has been debated ever since\nMoore set it out. It is commonly supposed that Moore here sets himself\nto refute philosophical skepticism; and that his performance, though\nintriguing, is unsuccessful. But this interpretation is incorrect:\nMoore's avowed aim is to prove the existence of an external\nworld, not to prove his knowledge of the existence of an\nexternal world. Moore himself set this out clearly in a subsequent\ndiscussion of his lecture:\nI have sometimes distinguished between two different\npropositions, each of which has been made by some philosophers, namely\n(1) the proposition \u2018there are no material things\u2019 and (2)\nthe proposition \u2018Nobody knows for certain that there are any\nmaterial things\u2019. And in my latest British Academy lecture called\n\u2018Proof of an External World\u2019 \u2026 I implied with regard\nto the first of these propositions that it could be proved to\nbe false in such a way as this; namely, by holding up one of your hands\nand saying \u2018This hand is a material thing; therefore\nthere is at least one material thing\u2019. But with regard to the\nsecond of the two propositions \u2026. I do not think I have ever\nimplied that it could be proved to be false in any\nsuch simple way \u2026 (\u2018A Reply to my Critics\u2019\n668)\n\n\nSetting aside any anti-skeptical intent therefore, what needs\nassessment is the metaphysical significance of Moore's proof, as a\nproof of an \u2018external world\u2019. Clearly, everything here\ndepends on what is to count as \u2018external\u2019, in particular\nwhether Moore's demonstration of the existence of his hands proves the\nexistence of things that are in no way at all dependent upon experience\nor thought. It is, I think, obvious that it does not; for that issue is\none which depends on broader philosophical questions about idealism\nwhich cannot possibly be settled that way. Moore's own distinction\nbetween questions of truth and questions of analysis should be\nintroduced here. Moore's \u2018proof\u2019 demonstrates the\n\u2018empirical\u2019 truth of a simple truism, that he has hands;\nbut it leaves entirely open the question of the analysis of this\ntruism. Yet it is at the level of analysis that the\n\u2018transcendental\u2019 question of whether things such as hands\nare altogether independent of experience and thought is to be\nanswered.\n\n\nAlthough, as I have indicated, Moore did not intend his\n\u2018proof\u2019 as a refutation of skepticism, he did frequently\nargue against skeptical views; and in his early writings, despite the\npassage quoted just now, he does sometimes give the impression that he\nthinks one can refute skepticism by simply bringing forward a\nstraightforward case of knowledge, such as \u2018I know that this is a\npencil\u2019. But on examination it turns out that his strategy here\nis more subtle; he wants to argue that we get our understanding of\nknowledge primarily through straightforward cases of this kind, and\nthus that skeptical arguments are self-undermining: for, on the one\nhand, they rely on general principles about the limits of knowledge and\nthus assume some understanding of knowledge but, on the other hand,\nthey undermine this understanding by implying that there are no such\nstraightforward cases of it. The force of arguments of this kind is,\nhowever, disputable, since the skeptic can always present his argument\nas a reductio ad absurdum of the possibility of knowledge; and\nthe same point applies to Moore's other attempts to convict the skeptic\nof some kind of pragmatic incoherence.\n\n\nIn two of his last writings, \u2018Four Forms of Skepticism\u2019\nand \u2018Certainty\u2019, Moore, perhaps dissatisfied with these\nearlier arguments and with the misunderstanding of his\n\u2018proof\u2019, returned to the issue and set himself the\nchallenge of refuting Cartesian skepticism. Notoriously, by the end of\n\u2018Certainty\u2019 Moore acknowledges defeat: having agreed that\nif he does not know that he is not dreaming, then he does not know such\nthings as that he is standing up and talking, he accepts (with\nreservations) that he cannot know for certain that he is not dreaming.\nMost commentators agree that Moore lost his way here. But it is not\nclear where, since Moore makes no obvious mistake. Nonetheless the\nviability of a \u2018common sense\u2019 response to skepticism\nremains an important feature of later discussions of the topic. Moore\nwas clearly right when, for example, he remarked that despite Russell's\nfrequent skeptical professions, Russell was nonetheless perfectly sure,\nwithout a shadow of doubt, on thousands of occasions, that he was\nsitting down. But what is difficult to achieve here is a formulation of\nthe skeptical dialectic which both shows the importance of Moore's\n\u2018common sense\u2019 affirmations of certainty and yet avoids a\ndogmatic insistence that knowledge does not need to be vindicated in\nthe face of skeptical argument. I myself think that Wittgenstein's\nwritings On Certainty, which were much influenced by Moore,\nbest indicate how this is to be achieved, but this is not the place to\ndemonstrate this achievement.\n7. Moore's Legacy\n\n\nMoore was not a systematic philosopher: unlike Reid's philosophy of\ncommon sense, Moore's \u2018common sense\u2019 is not a system. Even\nin ethics, where he comes closest to presenting a \u2018theory\u2019\nhe explicitly disavows any aspiration to provide a systematic account\nof the good. Hence, as the preceding discussions show, Moore's legacy\nis primarily a collection of arguments, puzzles and challenges. One\nnotable addition to those mentioned already is \u2018Moore's\nparadox\u2019: if I am mistaken about something, then I believe\nsomething which is not the case \u2014 perhaps that it is raining when\nit is not. Yet if I attribute this mistake to myself by saying\n\u2018It's not raining but I believe that it is\u2019 my statement is\nabsurd. Why is this so? Why is it absurd for me to say something that\nit is true about myself? Moore himself thought that the explanation\nhere was just that we generally believe the things we say, so that when\nsaying \u2018It's not raining\u2019 I imply that I believe this; but\nWittgenstein rightly saw that this explanation was superficial and that\nMoore had put his finger on a much deeper phenomenon here which\nconcerns our sense of our own identity as thinkers.\n\n\nThis case is typical. Moore had an unparalleled ability for\nidentifying philosophical \u2018phenomena\u2019. His own discussions\nof their significance are not always satisfying; but he would be the\nfirst to acknowledge his own fallibility. What matters is that if we\nstart where he starts we can be sure that we are dealing with something\nthat will tell us something important about ourselves and the\nworld.\n",
