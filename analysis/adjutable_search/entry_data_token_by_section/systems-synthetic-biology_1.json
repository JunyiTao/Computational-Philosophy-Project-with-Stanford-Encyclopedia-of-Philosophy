    "main_text": "Introduction || Research Practices in Systems Biology\n1.1 Research Practices in Systems Biology\n\nSystems biology can be interpreted as a response to limitations of\nresearch strategies investigating molecules and pathways in isolation.\nTo clarify the significance of their approach, systems biologists\noften stress the need to complement or go beyond what is perceived as\nreductionist strategies in molecular biology (De Backer et al. 2004;\nvan Regenmortel 2004). The contrast between systems biology and\nmolecular biology should not be overstated (see also\n Section 4.1).\n However, the contrasting comparison reveals how systems biology is\nmotivated by the need for a theoretical framework that is better\nsuited for studying the dynamics and organization of many\ninterconnected components (Boogerd et al. 2007; Kitano 2001).\n\nMolecular biology has been extremely successful in generating\nknowledge on biological mechanisms through the twin strategies of\ndecomposition and localization of component parts and molecular\noperations (Bechtel & Richardson 1993 [2010]). But the very\nsuccess of the detailed study of molecular pathways has also revealed\ndynamic interfaces and crosslinks between processes and components\nthat were previously assigned to distinct mechanisms or subsystems. To\naccount for a vast number of interacting components and multiple\nfeedback loops dynamic modeling is needed (Bechtel & Abrahamsen\n2012). Network modeling and computational simulations in systems\nbiology allow for the study of larger integrated systems and thus\nprovide strategies for recomposing the findings in the\ncontext of larger systems (Bechtel 2016; Gross & Green 2017).\nSystems are in this context generally understood as large\nnetworks of integrated components exhibiting non-linear dynamics.\nHowever, there is no unified view of what constitutes a\nsystems-approach (Calvert 2010; Calvert & Fujimura 2011). As\nclarified below, systems biology comprises different research\npractices with different ties to molecular biology, genomics, as well\nas to non-biological disciplines (see also Krohs & Callebaut\n2007).\n\nSystems biology research is sometimes divided into a\nsystems-theoretical and a pragmatic stream\n(O\u2019Malley and Dupr\u00e9 2005). The former is historically\nrelated to the initial use of the term \u2018systems biology\u2019\nin 1968, denoting the merging of systems theory and biology\n(Mesarovi\u0107\n 1968).[1]\n This definition has been taken up as providing a theoretical vision\nand reorientation also for modern systems biology (Wolkenhauer &\nMesarovi\u0107 2005; Drack & Wolkenhauer 2011).\nSystems-theoretical proponents view systems biology as an opportunity\nto revive important theoretical questions that for half a century\nstood in the shade of the success of experimental biology. Examples of\nsuch questions are what characterizes living systems and whether\ngeneric organizational principles can be identified (see\n Section 3.2).\n In contrast, the pragmatic stream views systems biology as a\nsuccessor of genomics and as a powerful extension of molecular\nbiology. This stream is sometimes referred to as molecular systems\nbiology (De Backer et al. 2010), and practitioners within this field\nrelate the emergence of systems biology to the production of data\nwithin genomics and other high-throughput technologies from the late\n1990s and onwards (G\u00fcttinger & Dupr\u00e9 2016).\n\nKrohs and Callebaut (2007) consider omics-disciplines a third\ndimension or root of systems biology due to the impact of data-rich\nmodeling strategies on the development of the\n approach.[2]\n Omics fields allow for large-scale measurements of relations between\nvast number of molecular components (e.g., genes or associated protein\nconcentrations). Since modeling tools in molecular biology have\nlimited capacity for handling large quantitative datasets, researchers\nturned to the exploration and further development of mathematical and\ncomputational strategies developed in engineering and physics\n(Alberghina & Westerhoff 2005).\n\nAlthough not all systems biologists put equal emphasis on the\nprospects of big data, there is a general acceptance in the community\nthat mathematical and computational approaches are required to account\nfor biological complexity. The first international conference on\nsystems biology was held in 2000 (at the first Systems Biology\nInstitute in Tokyo), and thematic journal issues and dedicated\njournals quickly followed (Kitano 2002a,b). Since then, many systems\nbiology research institutions have emerged, and large-scale\ninternational collaborations have been initiated.\n1.1.1 Network Approaches in Systems Biology\n\nWhat is distinctive about systems biology can in part be understood\nthrough the characteristics and implications of different styles of\nrepresentation. Whereas textbooks and research papers in molecular and\ncell biology typically contain mechanistic diagrams tracking\ninteractions between specific genes and proteins, representations in\nsystems biology often display interactions between a vast number of\nmolecular components as abstract networks of interconnected nodes and\nlinks. This difference in representational style is epistemically\nsignificant, because it highlights an increasing focus on the\norganizational structure of the system as a whole.\n\nBy conducting correlation-based studies of how multiple genes and\nproteins are associated with each other, and how these are connected\nto specific biological processes, systems biology research has\nrevealed common patterns in biological networks such as scale-free\nnetwork architectures and multi-level hierarchies (Ravasz et al.\n2002). Systems biologists often distinguish between two major classes\nof networks based on their connectivity distribution (how components,\nor nodes, in the network are connected to other nodes).\nExponential and scale-free network structures are\nillustrated on\n Figure 1\n (for details on the differences, see Albert et al. 2000). An\nexponential network is largely homogeneous with approximately the same\nnumber of links per node, and it is unlikely to find nodes with many\nlinks. In contrast, scale-free networks are inhomogeneous. Most nodes\nhave only a few links but some nodes (called hubs) have a large number\nof\n connections.[3]\n\n\n\nFigure 1: An example of a network\nrepresentation in systems biology, showing the difference between an\nexponential network and a scale-free network. Red\nnodes are the five nodes with most links, green nodes are the first\nneighbors of red nodes (from Albert et al. 2000: 379, reprinted by\npermission from Macmillan Publishers Ltd: Nature, copyright 2000).\n\n\nInterestingly, many real-world networks such as social networks, the\nWorld Wide Web, and regulatory networks in biology display scale-free\narchitectures. This raises important questions about whether\nreal-world networks can be related to more generic structural\ntypes with characteristic functional capacities. For example, the\nscale-free structure makes the average path length between any two\nnodes in the network small, and this structure has therefore been\nassociated with capacities for coordinated regulation throughout the\nnetwork (Albert et al. 2000). Moreover, scale-free networks exhibit a\nhigh error tolerance, understood as robustness against failure of\nrandom nodes and links (e.g., random gene deletion). These functional\nproperties are not shared by exponential networks, and illustrate some\nadvantages of the scale-free structure. However, the functional\nimportance of hubs in scale-free networks at the same time results in\nfragility to attacks on central notes (Albert et al. 2000;\nBarab\u00e1si & Oltvai 2004). Similarly, a multi-layered network\nstructure called a bow-tie network connects many inputs and\noutputs through a central core (the knot of the bow-tie) that consists\nof a small number of elements (Kitano & Oda 2006). This structure\nhas been associated with efficient information flow, but also with\nfragility towards perturbations of the intermediate nodes in the core\nof the network.\n\nSome systems biologists examine network architectures in the hope that\nsmaller functional units or patterns can be identified that are akin\nto modules in electronic networks (Hartwell et al. 1999). One example\nof pattern-detection within large datasets has received special\nattention from philosophers of science, namely research on so-called\nnetwork motifs. Network motifs are defined as \u201cpatterns\nof interaction that recurs in a network in many contexts\u201d (Alon\n2007: 268). By comparing the gene regulatory network of the bacterium\nE. coli to random networks, it was discovered that a few\ncircuit patterns occurred more frequently than expected by chance\n(Shen-Orr et al. 2002). Statistically significant circuits were\ndefined as network motifs. Two examples of network motifs are shown in\n Figure 2,\n called coherent and incoherent feedforward loops (cFFL and iFFL).\n\n\n\nFigure 2: Two examples of network\nmotifs, the coherent and incoherent feedforward loop (cFFL and iFFL).\nThe diagrams represent the regulation of a gene Z, via a direct path\nbetween a transcription factor X to Z, and an indirect connection from\nX via another gene or transcription factor Y to Z. Arrows represent\ngene activation (+) and a vertical bar inactivation (-). In a coherent\nfeedforward loop (cFFL), all connections are activating. In the\nincoherent feedforward loop (iFFL), the path from Y to Z inhibites\ngene expression. (Adapted from Alon 2007: 47).\n\n\nAkin to common circuit types in electronic networks, it was\nhypothesized that the recurring wiring patterns may indicate\ngeneralizable functional behaviors. Mathematical analysis suggested\nthat the cFFL may function as a sign-sensitive delay element that\nfilters out noisy inputs for gene activation (e.g., sporadic levels of\nnutrients in the environment). In contrast, the regulatory function of\nthe iFFL was hypothesized to be an accelerator that creates a rapid\npulse of gene expression in response to an activation signal. These\npredicted functions have been experimentally demonstrated in living\nbacteria (Mangan et al. 2003). Moreover, similar and additional\nnetwork motifs have been found in other species and in other\nregulatory networks important to cell-signaling, metabolism, and\ndevelopmental processes (Alves & Sorribas 2011; Peter &\nDavidson 2015; Tyson & Nov\u00e1k 2010). Such results have\nsparked interesting debates on whether network motifs could be seen as\ndesign principles, whose functions are generalizable across\ndifferent biological contexts (see\n Section 2.3).\n\nPhilosophers and scientists alike have debated the implications of\nresearch focusing on generic properties of biological networks, rather\nthan the properties of specific molecular components (e.g.,\nBarab\u00e1si 2002; Bechtel 2015a,b; Craver 2016). Among the\ncontroversial issues is how the enhanced focus on topological\nproperties relates to more traditional mechanistic explanations in\nbiology\n (Section 4.2).\n A related issue is whether functional capacities can be derived from\nan analysis of network architectures alone. Some systems biologists\nand philosophers have pointed to the limitations and possible biases\nassociated with inferences of functions from automated\npattern-detection in datasets (Calvert 2012; Keller 2005; Krohs 2012;\nsee also Prill et al. 2010). Specifically, some have called for a more\ndynamic approach that can account for the context of the whole network\nand how it changes over time.\n\nNetwork models are also used to study temporal aspects of\ncoordinated processes in cells and the evolutionary dynamics and\nstability of gene regulatory networks (de Lichtenberg et al. 2005;\nHogeweg 2012; Knight & Pinney 2009). Of scientific as well as\nphilosophical relevance is whether and how network approaches can\nextend mechanistic strategies by identifying how multiple biological\nprocesses are\n\norganized and coordinated in time (Green et al. 2018; Bechtel 2020),\nor, alternatively, provide new types of explanations (Kosti\u0107 et\nal. 2020; Su\u00e1rez & Deulofeu 2019). This topic will be\nfurther discussed in Section 4.2.\n1.1.2 Research Objectives and Recent Developments\n\nWhereas some engineering-inspired systems biologists search for\nfunctional units or modules in biological networks, another line of\nresearch emphasizes the need for a \u2018global\u2019 approach\ninspired by dynamical systems theory (Huang et al. 2009; Jaeger &\nCrombach 2012). Drawing on Waddington\u2019s idea of the epigenetic\nlandscape of cell differentiation, the global approach represents\ndynamical states in a network through vectors, attractors, and\ntrajectories in a state space (Huang 2012; for a philosophical\nanalysis, see Fagan 2012). The framework explores how inherent\nmathematical properties of the network architectures may constrain\ndevelopmental and evolutionary processes, in a way analogous to how\nlaws of motion constrain the possible planetary movements (Goodwin et\nal. 1993). The global approach is sometimes highlighted as being in\nopposition to mechanistic or \u201cmodular\u201d engineering\napproaches (Huang 2011; Fagan 2016). Controversies of this kind can\nreveal interesting differences in research aims as well as different\nstandards for models and explanation present in systems biology\n (Section 5.1).\n\nSome systems biologists describe their approach as one occupied with\nfunctional, rather than evolutionary questions (Boogerd et\nal. 2007; Hofmeyr 2007). By stressing the autonomy of functional\nbiology, beyond discussions of selected effects, philosophy of systems\nbiology can help balance the extensive emphasis on evolutionary\nbiology in philosophy of biology (Pradeu 2016). At the same time,\nevolutionary systems biology\u00a0presents a new research\napproach aiming to extend both systems biology and evolutionary\nbiology\n (Section 3.3).\n\nAnother important extension of systems biology is the emergence of\nsystems medicine, the medical application of systems biology.\nSystems biology has from the outset been associated with ambitions to\nsolve grand societal challenges. Examples are the aims to provide a\nbetter understanding of complex diseases like cancer, and the vision\nof developing patient-specific models that will allow for\nindividualized disease prediction and prevention\n (Section 5.3).\n\nThe aforementioned aims are often pursued through large-scale\ninternational collaborations where many research teams provide data\nand models to be integrated in complex models of whole cells (e.g.,\nThe Virtual Cell Project), whole organs (e.g., the\nVirtual Liver Project), and even the whole human body (e.g.,\nThe Virtual Physiological Human and the Physiome\nProject). Such projects raise new exciting questions for\nphilosophy of science concerning strategies for model building and\nmodel validation (Carusi 2014). Moreover, they provide new sources for\nphilosophical discussions on reduction and explanation\n (Section 4)\n and on the societal applications of big data biology\n (Section 5).\n1.2 Research Practices in Synthetic Biology\n\nThe term synthetic biology was used already in the 1970s and 1980s,\nbut the development of synthetic biology in its modern context is also\nconnected to genomics (Morange 2009; O\u2019Malley 2009; Gelfert\n2013). In the wake of big data production around year 2000,\ncomprehensive gene regulatory networks could be constructed that\nallowed for more systematic and more ambitious design projects. Just\nlike systems biologists commonly define their approach in opposition\nto the focus on isolated molecules or pathways in molecular biology,\nso is synthetic biology sometimes framed as a system-oriented approach\nthat moves beyond isolationist approaches in genetic engineering\n(O\u2019Malley et al. 2008). Also in this context, however, the ties\nto precursors are diverse, and there are different views on whether\nmodular approaches are compatible with biological complexity (see\nbelow).\n\nThe term synthetic biology became an official label with the first\nSynthetic Biology Conference in 2004, highlighting the\nBioBrickTM standard as a paradigm example of the\nengineering aim to design living systems through assembling of modular\nparts (Endy 2005; Bensaude-Vincent 2013). But the relation to\nengineering is complex, and synthetic biology displays a plurality of\nepistemic aims, visions and methodological frameworks.\n1.2.1 Aims and Visions\n\nA central research aim in synthetic biology is to modify gene\nregulatory pathways so as to control biochemical reactions and produce\nbiochemicals of societal value. For example, genetically modified\nmicroorganisms can work as biosensors that detect toxic chemicals or\nhelp clean up contaminated soil and water by metabolizing toxic\ncompounds (Khalil & Collins 2010). Many efforts are also directed\ntowards improvements of biomedical research and clinical practices,\ne.g., through\u00a0diagnostic tools, and personalized cancer\ntreatments (Christiansen 2016b). Products of synthetic biology that\nare already commercially available include biomedical compounds used\nin treatments against diabetes and malaria, nitrogen fertilizers, and\nflavouring substances for \u201cbleeding\u201d plant-based burgers\n(Voigt 2020). Most prominently, the fast development of effective\nsynthetic mRNA vaccines against Covid-19 points to the potential\nof\u00a0synthetic biology in supporting \u201cpandemic\npreparedness\u201d (Vickers and Freemont\u00a02022), although these\ndevelopments draw on molecular techniquest that precede the field of\nsynthetic biology.\u00a0\n\nMuch of synthetic biology research can be characterized as\napplication-oriented innovations that utilize and modify biological\nstructures. But not all practices fit this description. Some synthetic\nbiologists pursue a basic science approach to understand the origin of\nlife or the conditions for minimal life\n (Section 3.2).\n Others are driven by the wish to create artificial life in the lab,\ninspired by von Neumann\u2019s (1966) vision of a self-reproducing\nautomaton. This aim may be achieved through the design of macroscale\n\u2018living technology\u2019 (Bedau 2009). Examples are 3D printers\nthat can print biological tissue structures and perhaps\u2014with\ntime\u2014also replicate\n themselves.[4]\n Thus, synthetic biology is an umbrella term covering very diverse\nresearch practices.\n1.2.2 Knowledge-Making Practices in Synthetic Biology\n\nExamining the diversity of knowledge-making practices in synthetic\nbiology, O\u2019Malley et al. (2008) suggest a distinction between\nDNA-based device construction, genome-driven cell\nengineering, and protocell creation.\n\nDNA-based device construction, or what Benner and Sismour\n(2005) characterize more broadly as the engineering trend, explores\nthe extent to which interchangeable and functionally distinct\ncomponents can be designed and implemented in a modular fashion. The\nBioBrick Foundation is a paradigmatic example of this approach\n(biobricks.org). The guiding principles for this approach are\nstandardization, decoupling, and abstraction of parts and functional\ndescriptions (Endy 2005). Examples of DNA-based devices are the\nrepressilator (Elowitz & Leibler 2000, see\n Section 2.1),\n the synthetic toggle switch (Gardner et al. 2000; see\n Section 2.3),\n as well as production of synthetic artemisinin for antimalarial drugs\n(Keasling 2010). The orientation towards functional devices and\nmachine-like control is also explicit in the so-called iGEM\ncompetition (Genetically Engineered Machine) where student teams\ncompete in the task of constructing genetically engineered biological\nsystems to address societal problems. Whether the ideal of\nconstructing standardized and replaceable parts is compatible with\nbiological complexity is an ongoing topic of debate\n (Sections 2\n and\n 3).\n\nGenome-driven cell engineering in synthetic biology departs\nfrom the modularity assumption of DNA-based device construction by\nfocusing on the functioning of whole genomes or whole cells\n(O\u2019Malley et al. 2008). This practice includes transplantation\nof foreign or modified genomes into empty \u2018chassis cells\u2019\nto acquire new functions (Chan et al. 2005), and synthesis of\n\u201cminimal genomes\u201d (Andrianantoandro et al. 2006; Simons\n2021). The notion of a minimal genome highlights the idea that\nexisting organisms may have genomes more complex than necessary for\nthe basic functions of survival and reproduction. The human parasite\nMycoplasma genitalium has been considered a model organism\nfor the exploration of such questions due to its small genome, and it\nhas also been the target for the first whole-cell model in systems\nbiology (Karr et al. 2012). In 2010, scientists at the J. Craig Venter\nInstitute (JCVI) created a synthetic genome of another bacterial\nspecies of the same genus, Mycoplasma mycoides (Gibson et al.\n2010). From the synthetic DNA sequence, the researchers could partly\ncontrol the production of new Mycoplasma mycoides cells. This\ngenome was further reduced to a working approximation for the simplest\nsynthetic minimal genome (JCVI-syn 3.0), allowing cells to function\nand reproduce with only 473 genes (Hutchison et al. 2016; see also\nSung et al. 2016). At the same time as lower boundaries for biological\ncomplexity are explored, other synthetic biologists aim to manipulate\nand control the functions of genomes of more complex species, such as\nyeast and algae (Calvert & Frow 2015; Georgianna & Mayfield\n2012; see Simons 2021).\n\nThe third category of synthetic biology, protocell creation,\ntakes on the ambitious aim to construct simple approximations of\nliving cells de novo (O\u2019Malley et al. 2008).\nResearchers within this stream are often interested in the fundamental\nquestion of what life is, and the notion of applied science may not be\nan appropriate description of this research approach (see\n Section 3.2).\n Historically, the theoretical discussion of what life is has often\nbeen coupled to wet-lab synthesis of compounds associated with early\nor minimal\n life.[5]\n Synthetic biology takes this approach further through synthesis and\nmanipulation of vesicles resembling primitive cells, as well as\nthrough advanced computational simulations of gene regulatory networks\n(Luisi 2006; Kauffman 2015). This research practice connects to\nprojects within genome-driven cell engineering investigating the\nminimal requirements for a living system to function, survive, and\nreproduce. Research on protocells may focus primarily on understanding\nthe origin of life as we know it, or aim to create synthetic life\nforms in other and simpler ways (Rasmussen et al. 2008).\n\nDeplazes (2009) has suggested the following extended classification of\npractices within synthetic biology: i) bioengineering, ii) synthetic\ngenomics, iii) protocell synthetic biology, iv) unnatural molecular\nbiology, and v) in silico approaches (see\n Figure 3).\n While the categories of work on protocells and synthetic genomes\noverlap with the categorization by O\u2019Malley et al. (2008),\nDNA-based device construction is here further divided into\nbioengineering (exemplified by assembly standards like\nBioBricksTM) and unnatural molecular biology.\nUnnatural molecular biology aims to create systems with different\ncomponents, e.g., artificial nucleic acids based on a different coding\nsystem. Philosophers have debated whether the term\n\u2018unnatural\u2019 distinguishes practices in synthetic biology\nfrom other bioengineering approaches (Lewens 2013; Preston 2013). But\nthe emphasis on synthetic artifacts underscores the affinity to\nsynthetic chemistry and perhaps also to the \u2018chemist style of\nthinking\u2019, emphasizing synthesis and invention in addition to\nanalysis and discovery (Bensaude-Vincent 2009, 2013, 2015; see also\nBursten 2020, ed.).\n\n\n\nFigure 3: Schematic representation of\nthe five categories of synthetic biology and their connections. (From\nDeplazes 2009: 431, Copyright 2009 by John Wiley & Sons, Inc.\nreprinted by permission of John Wiley & Sons, Inc.).\n\n\nDeplazes\u2019 fifth category, in silico synthetic biology,\nfocuses on the development and practical implementation of computer\nsimulations. Deplazes argues that in silico synthetic\nmodeling should be a distinct category because many of the\ncomputational models have \u201clittle or no direct reference to\nliving organisms\u201d (Deplazes 2009: 430). As\n Figure 3\n illustrates, computational design is an important part\nof\u00a0research practices in synthetic biology. But the\ncharacteristics of various roles of simulations can shed new light on\nphilosophical discussions of the relation between models and target\nsystems, and between modeling, experimentation, and synthesis\n(Knuuttila & Loettgers 2013a,b; Carusi et al. 2012).\n\nAbstracting from the variety of research practices, a distinctive\nfeature of synthetic biology is that it aims \u201cto go beyond mere\nmodeling and to treat biological systems as fully constructible\nobjects\u201d (O\u2019Malley 2009: 381; see also Schyfter 2013).\nThus, synthetic biology opens new philosophical questions concerning\nthe relation between synthesis and analysis, between artificial and\nnatural target systems, and between machine and organism (Holm &\nPowell 2013; Nordman 2015).\n2. Design Approaches in Biology\n2.1 Designing and Understanding Life\n\nSystems and synthetic biology offer new opportunities to reconsider\nthe prospects and limitations of engineering approaches for biological\nresearch (Braillard 2015; Calcott et al. 2015). Engineering approaches\nare often considered inadequate to grasp biological complexity.\nSpecifically, design thinking has often been associated with\nadaptationism, i.e., the assumption that biological traits are\noptimally \u201cdesigned\u201d by natural selection (Orzack &\nForber 2010). Accordingly, critics have argued that the engineering\napproach may lead to a simplified understanding of evolution as driven\nsolely by natural selection (Lynch 2007). But whereas some approaches\nin systems biology can be described as adaptationist (Green 2014), it\ncannot be assumed that design approaches always entail adaptationist\nimplications. Systems biologists may adopt a \u2018thin\u2019 notion\nof design focusing primarily on the relations between structures and\nfunctions (Green et al. 2015b). Because research in systems and\nsynthetic biology often is often dissociated from evolutionary\nconsiderations, these research practices may force philosophers to\nreexamine the concepts of biological function and design beyond\ntraditional aetiological accounts (Holm 2012; Preston 2008; see also\nMossio et al. 2009).\n\nIn this context, it is debatable whether the thin notion of design is\ncompatible with biological complexity. Some scholars have raised\nconcerns that the machine-view of organisms (and use of design\nmetaphors) may lead to a neglect of distinct biological features such\nas autonomy, evolvability, and intrinsic purposiveness (Nicholson\n2019; see also Jacob 1977; Kogge & Richter 2013; McLeod and\nNerlich 2017). Design approaches may implicitly enforce the view that\noperations and outputs of specific parts are stable and predictable\nacross different contexts. In biology, context-sensitivity and\ndegeneracy between genotype-phenotype-relations may provide severe\nlimitations to the utility of this heuristic (Boudry & Pigliucci\n2013; G\u00fcttinger 2013; see also\n Section 3.1).\n Yet, as outlined in the following sections, the ties to engineering\nare multi-faceted in both systems and synthetic biology.\n2.2 Reverse and Forward Engineering\n\nFeynman\u2019s \u2018last blackboard\u2019 statement in 1988 that\n\u201cwhat I cannot create, I do not understand\u201d is often cited\nin the context of synthetic biology and has sparked philosophical\nreflections on the relation between understanding and design\n(O\u2019Malley 2009; Holm 2012; Calvert & Frow 2013). Although\nsynthetic biology is distinct from systems biology in the explicit aim\nto design synthetic systems, it is often described as a practice\nrelying on systems biology as a theoretical foundation for design\n(Barrett et al. 2006).\n\nSynthetic and systems biology are sometimes described through the\ncomplementary aims of forward and reverse engineering. Forward\nengineering refers to the design of systems with novel functions,\noften by drawing on an existing high-level model (e.g., an existing\ncode or living cell). Forward engineering, or re-engineering, can lead\nto more complex systems, but simplicity may also be pursued through\nimplementation of a more abstract coding language or through reduction\nor rewiring of (genetic) circuits. Reverse engineering refers\nto the aim to understand the functioning of a system\n\u2018backwards\u2019 by examining an existing system in contexts\nwhere consulting a design protocol is not an option. The search for\nrecurring network motifs\n (Section 1.1.1)\n is an example of how systems biologists may reverse engineer the\nstructure of a system to understand its functional capacities. Because\nfunctional features such as robustness are not only important to the\nsurvival of organisms but also to design problems in engineering,\nreverse engineering of organizational features that underpin such\ncapacities is an important aim in both fields (Csete & Doyle 2002;\nHartwell et al. 1999; Kitano 2004; Stelling et al. 2004).\n\nReverse and forward engineering approaches may challenge the\nphilosophical perspective on how-possibly-models, which are often\ntaken to be stepping-stones for how-actually explanations. In systems\nand synthetic biology, however, how-possibly models can be explanatory\nin their own right - in explaining how possibly biological\nfunctions can be realized in natural or artificial systems (Green\n2015; Koskinen 2017). In engineering, reverse engineering is an\nactivity geared towards the identification of generic features of\nsystem design, or design principles, that can be reused in\nother systems. Similarly, reverse engineering in systems biology aims\nto identify biological design principles that can increase\nthe understanding of structure-function relations across different\nsystems (Csete & Doyle 2002; Doyle & Stelling 2006; Voit\n2003), and potentially also be used in the design of novel systems in\nsynthetic biology (Koskinen 2019).\n2.3 Design Principles in Biology\n\nSystems and synthetic biology not only adopt mathematical tools from\nelectronic and control engineering but also a conceptual framework in\nwhich biological functions are understood in terms of control\nprinciples and generic representations such as feedback control\n(Gramelsberger 2013; MacLeod & Nersessian 2013a,b). The search for\nfunctional principles, with applications to different systems in\nbiology and engineering, dates back to the ideals of cybernetics and\nbiochemical systems theory (Savageau 1976; Wiener 1948). Negative\nfeedback control has long been a central principle in mechanical and\nelectronic engineering to maintain stable concentrations and minimize\nfluctuations. An important insight from cybernetics is that the same\nformalization can also describe biological processes, e.g., where a\nreaction is inhibited as a result of accumulation of the product of\nthe same reaction. An abstract model of negative feedback can\ntherefore denote a functional principle that holds for a larger class\nof systems (Green & Wolkenhauer 2013).\n\nCharacteristic of the search for design principles in modern systems\nbiology is that the strategy is enforced through automated\npattern-detection in network models based on large biological\ndatasets, as exemplified by the search for network motifs\n (Section 1.1.1).\n The hope is that simple control principles, using e.g., positive and\nnegative feedback, can make up basic building blocks of biological\nfunctioning such as filters, switches, oscillators, amplifiers,\ndetectors etc. (Alon 2007; Tyson et al. 2003). One such example is the\nso-called toggle-switch, a simple regulatory circuit that is\nconsidered a design principle in both systems and synthetic\nbiology.\n\nLike a toggle-switch that turns an electrical device ON or OFF,\ngenetic toggle-switches have been found to regulate many biological\nprocesses such as the cell cycle of budding yeast and developmental\nprocesses in fruit flies (Tyson et al. 2003; Jaeger & Crombach\n2012). A genetic toggle-switch is a double-negative feedback loop that\nshifts the system between two distinct stable states of gene\nexpression\u2014allowing synthesis of one protein while another is\nrepressed. Synthetic biologists have succeeded in constructing a\nsynthetic toggle switch in E. coli (Gardner et al. 2000), and\nthe toggle switch is now considered part of the design composites or\n\u2018computational templates\u2019 for building new synthetic\nsystems (Choffnes et al. 2011; Humphreys 2004). Recent work in\nsynthetic biology also involve RNA-based regulatory genetic switches,\ncalled riboswitches, that can control gene expression by\nbinding to specific ligands (Mehrshahi et al. 2020). The dynamic\nbehavior of genetic toggle-switches have also been investigated in\nstudies of parameter spaces for robust functioning of network motifs\n(Tyson & Nov\u00e1k 2010), and in approaches combining the\nmodeling framework of dynamical systems theory with reverse\nengineering of gene regulatory networks from experimental data (Huang\net al. 2009; Jaeger & Crombach 2012). Because of the abstract\nnature of proposed design principles, an interesting philosophical\nquestion is how such strategies relate to discussions about the\npossibilities of laws-like generalizations in biology.\n\nBiological systems are often taken to be too contingent, diverse, and\ncontext-dependent to allow for derivation of laws or general\nprinciples akin to those found in physics (Burian et al. 1996). The\nquest for design principles and generic topological features in\nbiology is therefore interesting test cases to explore such issues\n(Green 2015b; Moreno and Su\u00e1rez 2020). A key issue in this\ndebate is whether generalizable functions can be inferred from\norganizational structures, relatively independently of cellular,\norganismal, and environmental contexts. This issue has often been\ndiscussed as a question of multiple realizability, i.e.\nwhether a higher-level state or property is relatively independent of\nthe causal details or properties at a lower level because the\nsystem's structure determines the function. Systems biology bring\nnew light to these debates, e.g., by discussing\u00a0the extent to\nwhich network motifs provide concrete examples of this\nphenomenon\u00a0(Fang 2020).\u00a0Multiple\u00a0realizability of\nfunctions via network motifs has also been argued to provide a design\nheuristic explored in synthetic biology, e.g., when engineering\nminimal genetic systems and artificial biochemical systems (Koskinen\n2019). The search for network motifs and other functional units make\napparent that assumptions of modularity are not completely abandoned.\nRather, the notion of modularity may be reconfigured via strategies\nfor structural decomposition of larger networks (Serban\n2020). However, some systems biologists and philosophers have\nquestioned whether functional \u2018units\u2019 can be meaningfully\nisolated from the workings of the network as a whole (DiFrisco and\nJaeger 2019; Huang 2011; Isalan et al. 2008), thus casting new light\non debates on reductionism and holism in the life sciences. A related\nquestion is how the enhanced focus on generic features of biological\nnetworks relates to mechanistic accounts of biological explanation\n (Section 4.2).\n3. Revisiting Biological Complexity\n\nEngineering is often promoted through the idea of rational design.\nSome synthetic biologists have adopted a similar vision of synthetic\norganisms as structures that can be assembled via replaceable and\nstandardized components, akin to Lego-bricks (front cover of\nScience, 2 September 2011 [333(6047)]). Yet, philosophers\nhave argued that the actual research practices in synthetic and\nsystems biology paint a different picture (Knuuttila & Loettgers\n2013a, 2014).\n3.1 Reverse and Forward Tinkering?\n\nRather than following a fixed design protocol, research in synthetic\nbiology often progresses through what is taken to be the opposite of\nrational design, namely kludging: a solution that is\nklumsy, lame, ugly, dumb but\ngood enough (O\u2019Malley 2009, 2011b). The\nresearch process can perhaps be described as reverse and\nforward tinkering, in which opportunities for modular\ndecomposition and recomposition are explored in iterative cycles to\narrive at piecemeal solutions. Some have argued that synthetic biology\nexhibits a reflexive double bind to engineering, because the design\nassumptions guiding the construction of the synthetic systems are\ncontinuously reevaluated (Knuuttila & Loettgers 2013a). That is,\nsynthetic biology does not only progress through similarities between\nbiology and engineering. Through the exploration of engineering\napproaches, important differences (or negative analogies)\nbetween biological and engineered systems are discovered (Knuuttila\n& Loettgers 2014)\n\nAn example of a possible negative analogy discussed in this context is\nthe role of noise in biological versus engineered systems. In\nengineering, oscillations are often associated with noise and lack of\nprecision, but oscillatory dynamics are characteristic of many\nbiological processes including metabolism and day and night rhythms\n(Knuuttila & Loettgers 2013a; see also Bechtel 2016). To study\noscillations in gene expression, synthetic biologists at the Elowitz\nlab constructed a synthetic genetic circuit called the\nrepressilator (Elowitz & Leibler 2000). The repressilator\nwas designed to test whether the oscillatory dynamics of gene\nexpression could be mathematically described via connected feedback\nloops in a simple regulatory circuit and implemented in a synthetic\nmodel.\n\nInterestingly, important insights resulted from the repressilator\nbecause it failed to produce regular oscillations as\npredicted by the underlying mathematical model. The mismatch between\nthe mathematical and synthetic model led to a reevaluation of the\nassumptions underlying the deterministic mathematical model (Knuuttila\n& Loettgers 2013a, 2014). Subsequent investigation of the dynamics\nof a stochastic version of the same model suggested that noise may be\nan inherent feature of oscillations in gene expression in living\ncells. The exploration of the functional role of noise and the\npotentials for stochastic modeling has since developed into an\nimportant research program of interest to biologists and engineers\nalike (Briat et al. 2016; Munsky et al. 2009; O\u2019Malley 2011b).\nThe repressilator and similar examples also sparked debates on whether\ndesign procedures in synthetic biology need to account for cellular\ncontexts, distributed organization of functions, and other features\nthat are unlike modular machines (G\u00fcttinger\n 2013).[6]\n\nTo what extent the ideal of precision engineering is pursued in\nsynthetic biology is therefore debatable. Some have stressed the\ncentrality of the engineering perspective because the construction of\nsynthetic models is guided by knowledge on which design principles can\nbe expected to create specific dynamic behaviors (e.g., Gramelsberger\n2013). Others have emphasized that synthetic modeling, as a kind of\nmaterial recomposition strategy, offer material constraints\nthat always involve open-ended aspects (Knuuttila & Loettgers\n2013b). The latter view highlights exploratory features of the\ntriangulation of mathematical, computational, and synthetic\napproaches. The notion of exploratory experimentation has\nalso been used to characterize research processes in systems biology,\nwhere scholars search for structural and functional patterns in\nbiological networks without being driven by a specific biological\nhypothesis (O\u2019Malley & Soyer 2012; Steinle 1997). Research\non network motifs\n (Section 1.1.1)\n is one example where engineering approaches were applied in an\nexploratory fashion to generate, rather than test, hypotheses on\nbiological functions (Alon 2007). Also in this context, the analysis\nmay lead to a reevaluation of design assumptions, e.g., whether the\nfunctions of network motifs are independent of the network context\nthey are embedded in (Isalan et al. 2008).\n\nIt should also be noted that synthetic biologists often aim to produce\nbiological technology that is more machine-like than natural organisms\n(Kastenhofer 2013a,b; O\u2019Malley 2011b). An alternative response\nto biological complexity may therefore be to make the designed system\nsimpler, for instance through genetic rewiring that ensures a higher\ndegree of modularity (Knuuttila & Loettgers 2013a). The explicit\naim to simplify synthetic models has been interpreted as\nacknowledgment of biological complexity, and it is therefore debated\nwhether the criticism of the machine-view in synthetic biology is\nmisguided (cf., Holm 2015; Nicholson 2013). The heuristic value of\ndesign approaches is, however, an ongoing topic of debate in both\nsystems and synthetic biology.\n3.2 Defining and Creating Minimal Life\n\nUnlike DNA-based device construction and genome-driven cell\nengineering, synthetic biologists in the practice of protocell\ncreation engage in classical theoretical discussions on what life\nis, and how it originated and evolved (Luisi 2006; O\u2019Malley et\nal. 2008). This research stream connects to discussions of the\nfundamental properties of life in systems biology (Cornish-Bowden\n2006; Letelier et al. 2011; Wolkenhauer and Hofmeyr 2007) and\nphilosophy (Bich 2010; Bich & Damiano 2007; Bedau & Cleland\n2010; Moreno & Mossio 2015).\n\nOne strand of research attempts to design minimal cells resembling\nearly cellular life-forms. Inspired by Maturana and Varela\u2019s\n(1972/1980) formulation of autopoiesis, some synthetic biologists\nexperiment on conditions for minimal cells through chemical models\nthat combine the continuous formation and destruction of the\ncompartment (the cell membrane) with metabolic processes inside the\ncell (e.g., Zepik et al. 2001). This research program specializes in\nsynthesis of lipid compartments, such as vesicles, to study\ncoordinated processes that possibly resemble self-maintenance in the\npre-biotic world (Luisi 2006). Moreover, vesicles have been used to\nexperiment on how catalytic molecules such as ribozymes and peptides\ncould become entrapped in lipid compartments and create precursors for\nmetabolic circuits (de Souza et al. 2014).\n\nAn important research goal is to provide a model for the fundamental\nfeatures that distinguish living systems from the non-living. So far,\nhowever, there is no consensus on the defining features of life.\nWhether this should be seen as a disappointment, indicating the\nuselessness of attempts to define life, is an ongoing issue of\nphilosophical debate. Different views on this question may depend on\ndifferent interpretations of what the project of defining\nlife entails in philosophy and science, e.g., whether the aim is\nto establish demarcate a natural kind (Cleland 2012) or to provide\noperational definitions of practical use in model and theory\nconstruction (Bich & Green 2018; Luisi 1998). More specific topics\nof debate are whether definitions of life must include Darwinian\nevolution, how evolution and units of selection should be defined, and\nwhether it is fruitful to categorize all the varieties of life forms\nunder one definition (Dupr\u00e9 & O\u2019Malley 2009; Laland\net al. 2009; Ruiz-Mirazo et al. 2010; Szostak et al. 2001)\n\nSystems biologists engaging in debates on the properties of life often\nstress the relevance of insights from classical philosophers. Examples\nare references to Aristotle or Kant in discussions on whether our\ncurrent notion of causation can adequately capture how parts and\nwholes in living systems stand in reciprocal causes and effect\nrelationships (Drack & Wolkenhauer 2011; Hofmeyr 2017). Other\nimportant sources of inspiration are Rosen\u2019s formalization of\nmetabolism-repair systems, (mathematical) general systems theory, and\ncategory theory (e.g., Drack 2015; Rosen 1991; Mesarovi\u0107 et al.\n2004; Letelier et al. 2011). The systems-theoretical stream is also\ninfluenced by mathematical biophysics (Rashevsky 1961),\nWaddington\u2019s theoretical biology (Fagan 2012), Biochemical\nSystems Theory (Hofmeyr 2007; Savageau 1976), and classical\nsystems-oriented physiology (Noble 2008).\n\nSystems-theoretical and organizational accounts often highlight the\nfunctional roles of constraints, autonomy, and causal closure of the\nprocesses of self-maintenance (Moreno & Mossio 2015; Wolkenhauer\n& Hofmeyr 2007). While also stressing the utility of the search\nfor general principles, some prefer the term organizing\nprinciples instead of design principles (Green & Wolkenhauer\n2013; Mesarovi\u0107 et al. 2004). This choice of terminology signals\nthe view that understanding living systems requires a\nsystems-theoretical approach in a broader sense than cybernetics. An\nintriguing question in this context is whether a different kind of\nformal or mathematical framework is required\u2014one that is adapted\nto biology rather than to engineering or physics (Bich & Damiano\n2008; Gramelsberger 2017; Rosen 1991).\n\nAnother debated issue in discussions about the fundamental properties\nof life is the relative priority of autonomy, openness and\ncollaboration. Whereas much research in philosophy and origin of life\nhas focused on individual organisms, recent insights from microbiology\nand synthetic biology have extended the focus on individual cells to\nalso include the interactions of cell colonies and pangenomic\npopulations (Dupr\u00e9 & O\u2019Malley 2009; Bich & Green\n2018; O\u2019Malley et al. 2019). For example, synthetic models can\nbe used to investigate the dynamics of colonies of giant oleate-based\nvesicles under hypothesized prebiotic conditions. For example, an\nexperiment conducted by Carrara and colleagues (2012) showed that that\nthe permeability of the vesicles to catalysts and macromolecules were\nmuch higher for the colonies, compared to individual vesicles. In some\ncases, the colonies also attracted each other and exchanged material.\nThe results raise important questions about whether life has arisen\nfrom \u2018cooperative mechanisms\u2019 between prebiotic systems,\nand whether we need to rethink ontological assumptions about what\nconstitutes a \u2018unity of life\u2019. Synthetic models can also\nbe used to study the role of structural and cognitive interactions for\nbiological identity and autonomy (Bich 2020). Meanwhile, research on\nminimal genomes and imagined artificial life forms can explore what is\nbiologically possible beyond what is found in natural systems\n(Koskinen 2017; Knuttila & Koskinen 2021). Synthetic biology,\nunderstood as a technoscience exploring the design of minimal\nand alternative life forms, thus has potential to address questions\nabout universal biology beyond the historical question about how life\noriginated (Simons 2021).\n3.3 Evolutionary Systems Biology\n\nSystems biology is often defined as an approach primarily concerned\nwith functional questions (Boogerd et al. 2007). Evolutionary systems\nbiology (ESB) explicitly seeks to expand this focus through\ninvestigations of the evolutionary dynamics of interacting networks\n(Soyer 2012). ESB aims to put the results of systems biology in a\nproper evolutionary context and also to enhance and extend current\nevolutionary biology. Specifically, ESB aims to develop more detailed\nmodels of genotype-phenotype maps to study causal changes over\nevolutionary time-scales and to enhance the predictive potential of\nevolutionary models. These aims are pursued by combining methods from\nmolecular and evolutionary biology with in silico evolution,\ncomparative genomic analysis, as well as with dynamical modeling of\nnetwork architectures (Bapteste and Papale 2021; Soyer &\nO\u2019Malley 2013).\n\nESB can be considered a meeting ground not only for systems biology\nand evolutionary biology but also for the integrated study of\ndevelopmental phenomena in an evolutionary perspective (O\u2019Malley\net al. 2015). Systems biology complements statistical sequence\nanalysis in population genetics and studies of constraints on\nevolutionary pathways in Evolutionary Developmental biology\n(EvoDevo)\u00a0through in silico modelling of large data-sets\n(Jaeger & Crombach 2012; Kim et al. 2011; see also Brigandt 2015).\nSome projects also draw on synthetic modelling of intracellular\nnetworks to investigate how the evolutionary potential of a lineage is\naffected by specific combinations of mutations (Palmer & Kishony\n2013).\n\nEvolutionary network modeling contributes to conceptual development in\nevolutionary biology, e.g., by throwing new light on discussions on\nthe unit of selection (Bapteste and Papale 2021). Another important\nline of investigation in ESB examines the evolutionary background for\nglobal network architectures, modular structures, and recurring\nnetwork motifs\n (Section 1.1.1;\n see also Krohs 2009). The structures may have arisen due to natural\nselection, but ESB also takes seriously the possibilities that\npatterns can arise as side-effects of genomic evolution and drift, or\nfrom a combination of selective and non-selective factors (Steinacher\n& Soyer 2012). An example of an insight from simulations of\nevolving yeast networks is that hierarchical structures with an\noverabundance of network motifs (feedforward loops) can emerge by\nnon-selective tinkering with promoter regions (Cordero &\nHogeweg 2006). In extended models, the integrated effects of selective\nand non-selective factors can be studied at multiple levels (Hogeweg\n2012). With the emphasis on pattern-generation and the potential for\nfuture evolutionary change, ESB takes up Hugo de Vries\u2019\nchallenge to explain not only the survival of the fittest but\nalso the arrival of the fittest (Wagner 2012, 2014). The hope\nis that evolutionary simulations can extend evolutionary biology by\nproviding a forward-looking account.\n\nEvolutionary biology has traditionally been considered as a historical\ndiscipline that provides explanations without giving predictions. ESB\noffers an opportunity to develop more detailed models of evolving\ngenotype-phenotype relations and to explore whether some evolutionary\npathways are predictable given enough information about the network\nstructures, dynamic states, and environmental conditions. Unlike\nforward engineering in synthetic biology, the aim is not to shape new\ndesigns but to understand the possible trajectories of change under\ndifferent conditions. That is, ESB goes beyond historical accounts in\nexploring the potential for evolvability or innovation\u2014what some\nhave called the \u2018tinkering potential\u2019 of system evolution\n(Koonin & Wolf 2010). Research on evolvability can, however, also\ninform and inspire functional analysis and design in synthetic biology\n(Calvert & Frow 2015; Lewens 2013). Thus, also in this context,\nthe relation between biology and engineering must also be\nreexamined.\n\nThe phenomena of tinkering and contingency in evolution are typically\ntaken to highlight the limitations of engineering approaches\nin biology (Jacob 1977; Lynch 2007). Interestingly, however, some\nsystems biologists and philosophers emphasize that a non-adaptationist\nframework can be reached through further cross-fertilization of\nbiology and engineering (Calcott et al. 2015). ESB and synthetic\nbiology can provide a broader perspective on engineering by\nconsidering how design often operates through modification of existing\nsystems. For instance, there are interesting similarities between\nevolvability in biology and a diachronic\nengineering goal in software engineering, where the aim is to\ndesign systems that can be adapted to serve future functional\nrequests, without having to rewrite the code from scratch (Calcott\n2014; see also Sol\u00e9 and Valverde 2020).\n\nThe ambition to predict evolutionary trajectories, even for simple\norganisms, may turn out to be extremely difficult. But ESB provides\nnew ways to investigate whether evolutionary pathways follow some\nrecognizable dynamical patterns. Simulations of how gene regulatory\nnetworks change over evolutionary time-scales can be coupled to\nexperimental evolution in bacteria or insects. For instance, the\ndevelopment of bacterial antibiotic resistance has been shown to be\nconstrained by interactions between different mutations, which may\nmake evolutionary biology informative also for the development and\ncombination of antibiotics used in medical treatment (Palmer &\nKrishony 2013; Weinreich et al. 2006).\n\nSome proponents expect that ESB will uncover regularities or stable\nevolutionary patterns across various types of networks and species.\nSuch regularities may not resemble universal laws, but the hope is\nthat some general principles underlying evolutionary dynamics can be\nidentified, referred to as \u201claws of evolution\u201d (Koonin\n2011), \u201cevolutionary design principles\u201d (Steinacher &\nSoyer 2012) or \u201cgeneric principles\u201d of evolution (Jaeger\n& Monk 2013). ESB thus offers excellent cases for debating the\npossibility of turning evolutionary biology into a more predictive\nfield with generalizable principles (Lobkovsky & Koonin 2012; Papp\net al. 2011). Moreover, it is a rich field for discussing the\nimplications of an \u2018extended modern synthesis\u2019 that\ncombines molecular, mathematical, computational, synthetic, and\npopulation genetic approaches to evolution (Pigliucci 2007;\nO\u2019Malley et al. 2015).\n4. Revisiting Classical Philosophical Questions\n\nWith the emphasis on systems and interacting networks, both systems\nand synthetic biology explicitly engage in one of the oldest\nphilosophical discussions on the relationship between the whole and\nits parts, or between holism and reductionism. This section examines\nhow classical questions are reframed in the new light of strategies\nfor large-scale data production and dynamic modeling.\n4.1 Reductionism and the Sum of the Parts\n\nAs mentioned in the introduction, proponents of systems biology often\nexplicitly define their approach in contrast to reductionist\nstrategies in molecular biology. Molecular biology is depicted as a\nfield studying molecular components and pathways in isolation, whereas\nsystems biology integrates the pieces of the puzzle in the context of\nthe system as a whole (van Regenmortel 2004; Keller 2005; Kitano\n2002a,b). The contrast between molecular biology and systems biology\nis often overstated, and much of systems biology research is also\nfocused on specific molecular difference-makers (De Backer et al.\n2010; Gross 2017; O\u2019Malley & Dupr\u00e9 2005). However,\nsystems biology may give a novel interpretation of Aristotle\u2019s\ndictum that the whole is more than the sum of the parts by\nspecifying what more means in the context of contemporary\nbiology.\n4.1.1. Modular and Bottom-Up Reductionism\n\nWhen systems biologists criticize reduction in molecular biology, the\nissue at stake is typically the limitations of studying biological\nparts or modules in isolation. Because the target of the criticism\noften differs from the more traditional philosophical focus on\nreduction of higher-level to lower-level explanations (Brigandt &\nLove 2017), systems biologists can be said to oppose what has been\ntermed modular reductionism (Gross & Green 2017). An\nanti-reductionist stance towards modular reductionism needs not reject\nthe idea that living systems can be modelled and explained bottom\nup. For instance, while global approaches within these fields\nreject the modularity assumption, some keep the focus on genomes and\nmolecular networks as the primary determinants of biological functions\n(O\u2019Malley et al.\n 2008).[7]\n\nMany systems biologists have, however, also argued against reduction\nof higher-level models and explanations, and there is an ongoing\ndebate about how far genomics, proteomics, etc. will take us in\nsolving complex problems like understanding cancer (cf.,\nBarab\u00e1si et al. 2011; Hood et al. 2015). Similarly, researchers\ninvolved in projects aiming to simulate multiscale structures like the\nhuman heart emphasize the need to include macroscale parameters as\nthey provide functionally important constraints on the behavior of\nmicroscale processes (Bassingthwaighte et al. 2009; Kohl & Noble\n2009). An interesting reframing of Aristotle\u2019s dictum in this\ndiscussion is that living systems at the same time are more\nand less than the sum of the parts (see Hofmeyr 2017; Noble\n2012). In other words, the system as a whole constrains the degree of\nfreedom of lower-level parts and provides a functional organization of\nthese that are required for some system capacities (see below).\n\nGiven the increasing emphasis on comprehensive multiscale models,\nsystems biology research may have a unique potential for philosophical\ninsights considering the explanatory role of macroscale properties and\ntop-down effects. Systems biologists for instance point to how enzyme\nactivity is constrained by the chemical environment and the cellular\ncontext (Hofmeyr 2017), or how the biophysical properties of muscle\nfibers and cell membranes provide functional constraints on ionic\noscillations central to the generation of heart rhythms (Noble 2012).\nInterpreting top-down effects as constraining relations may exemplify\nwhat philosophers of science have called \u2018medium downward\ncausation\u2019 (Emmeche et al. 2000), which interprets downward\ncausation as boundary conditions. Noble (2012) explicitly endorses\nsuch a view when arguing that downward causation is necessary by\npointing out how equations describing the kinetics of ion channels in\ncardiac modeling cannot be solved without defining the boundary\nconditions (e.g., the cell voltage). Multi-scale modeling may thus\nhelp to give a more concrete mathematical reinterpretation of the\ncontroversial notion of downwards causation (see also Ellis et al.\n2011; Green 2018). Moreover, discussions of downward causation in\nsystems biology have practical as well as theoretical implications,\ne.g., for experimental design in cancer research on studies of cancer\nas a genetic or tissue-based disease (Bertolaso 2011; Soto et al.\n2008; see also\n Section 5.3).\n4.1.2 Emergence and Predictability\n\nDiscussions of downward causation are often connected to debates about\nwhether biological systems exhibit emergent properties (cf.,\nAlberghina & Westerhoff 2005; Boogerd et al. 2005, 2007; Kolodkin\net al. 2011). Emergence in the context of systems biology typically\nmeans that systems properties cannot be explained from\u00a0the\nproperties of parts. Discussions can center on epistemic questions\nabout whether systems properties can be predicted from analyses of\nlower-level constituents (epistemological emergence) to debates on\nwhether multilevel systems are fundamentally irreducible (ontological\nemergence).\n\nSome systems biologists are optimistic that current limitations in the\npredictive capacity of models can be overcome by increasing the\ncomplexity\u00a0of computational models, thus presenting a epistemic\ndeparture from the methodological principle of Ockham\u2019s razor\n(Kolodkin & Westerhoff 2011). Others stress that biological\ncomplexity forces life scientists to draw on abstract and idealized\nmodels (Hofmeyr 2017; Gross 2017; 2019). These debates center on\nfundamental questions about how far biological research can be taken\nby integrating more parameters and data points (Kolodkin et al. 2012),\nand how far we can \u2018extend ourselves\u2019 through\ncomputational approaches (Humphreys 2004; Vermeulen 2011). But they\nalso concern ontological questions about whether there are principled\nlimitations to our ability to predict and control living systems\n\u201cbottom-up\u201d (Bassingthwaighte et al. 2009; Green 2018;\nNoble 2012; Moreno and Su\u00e1rez 2020). Large-scale modeling\nprojects such as the Virtual Cell, the Physiome Project, and\nthe Virtual Physiological Human offer exciting cases for\nphilosophical analysis of the prospects and challenges associated with\nparameterizing and validating complex models (Carusi et al. 2012;\nCarusi 2014; Hunter et al. 2013). Ultimately, such projects may push\nthe boundaries for prediction and control in the life science, or may\nreveal deeper challenges of biological complexity.\n4.2 Explanatory Pluralism\n\nSystems biology also brings new insights to discussions of scientific\nexplanation. In particular, network analysis in systems biology have\nfurther sparked discussion about the roles of mathematical\nabstractions to identify organizational features, counterfactual\ndependencies, and generalizable aspects of biological systems. The\nintegration of different disciplinary inputs and emphasis on\nmathematical modeling make systems biology a particularly interesting\ncase for discussions of whether the mechanistic account can fully\ncapture the diversity of explanatory practices in contemporary\nbiology.\n\nMechanistic accounts initially emphasized the differences between the\nexplanatory ideal of covering laws in physics and explanations in\nmolecular biology (Craver & Tabery 2015). Mechanistic explanations\ncite how biological functions arise from the interactions and\norganization of component parts or entities (Bechtel & Richardson\n1993; Machamer et al. 2000; Glennan 2002). Since research in systems\nbiology is often integrated with research in molecular and cell\nbiology, some have argued that many cases in systems biology can\nreadily be seen as an extension of mechanistic research (Boogerd et\nal. 2013; Richardson & Stephan 2007). But although abstract\nmodeling is compatible with mechanistic research, it is a contested\nissue whether abstract models are developed towards research aims that\nare distinct from mechanistic explanations. While some contend that\nmathematical models are primarily used as inputs to or heuristics for\nmechanistic explanations, i.e., as mechanistic schemas (Darden 2002;\nMatthiessen 2015), others interpret the emphasis on quantitative and\ndynamic aspects as a departure from mechanistic explanations. One\nargument in support of the latter is that the modeling process does\nnot proceed from abstract to more detailed models, but in the opposite\ndirection, suggesting that mechanistic details may be vehicles for\nmore generic explanations rather than the other way around (Braillard\n2010; Serban & Green 2020). A second argument refers to the\ndifficulty of reconstructing a causal story from the abstract\nmathematical models (Issad & Malaterre 2015). Systems biology may\ntherefore also offer cases of non-mechanistic explanations.\n\nTopological or structural explanations emphasize how\nnetworks architectures generically determine dynamic behaviors,\nindependently of the causal details of the network (Huneman 2010;\nKosti\u0107 2020; Kosti\u0107 et al. 2020; Su\u00e1rez &\nDeulofeu 2019). Mathematical analysis of network structures underlying\nbiological robustness has been argued to exemplify this explanatory\ngoal (Jones 2014). Another type of non-mechanistic explanations is\nwhat Wouters (2007) calls design explanations, first outlined\nin the context of comparative physiology. Design explanations do not\ndescribe how a biological function is causally produced but instead\nclarify why a given design (and not an alternative design) is present.\nThey do so by pointing to constraints on the possible designs that\nmake some designs good, some suboptimal, and others impossible. The\nrelevance of design explanations for systems biology lies in the\ninterest to specify relations between functional capacities (e.g.,\nrobustness) and system organization (e.g., integral feedback control)\nvia design principles that are independent of specific contexts of\nimplementation (Braillard 2010; Boogerd 2017, see also Shinar &\nFeinberg 2011 for a candidate example from systems biology). Design\nexplanations highlight explanatory features similar to what Batterman\nand Rice (2014) call minimal model explanations (see also\nGross 2015). These explanatory accounts have been interpreted as\nvarieties of constraint-based explanations (Green and Jones\n2016), because they prioritize physical and formal constraints at the\nexpense of mechanistic details. Aside from highlighting differences in\nthe epistemic aims of explanation, some accounts also provide an\nontological justification for different explanatory\nstrategies, i.e., that higher-level phenomena are characterized by a\nfunctional loss of and autonomy from mechanistic details at lower\nlevels (Batterman and Green 2021; Moreno and Su\u00e1rez 2020).\n\nAnother approach is to consider explanations in systems biology as\nmergers of different types of explanations. Some accounts highlight\nthe compatibility of different explanatory aims as ingredients in a\npluralistic approach to biological explanation (Brigandt et al. 2018;\nMekios 2015). One way to clarify the compatibility is that different\napproaches highlight constitutive or causal aspects\n(Fagan 2015). Distinguishing between these can possibly help identify\nthe distinct contributions of causal mechanistic modeling and\nmathematical analysis of network dynamics. Whereas causal relations\nare often prioritized in mechanistic accounts, Fagan (2015) suggests a\njoint account of collaborative explanations that combine\ndescriptions of the spatial organization and the causal relations in\nthe system. The increasing reliance on formal modeling in systems\nbiology also call for an examination of the relation between\nmathematical and mechanistic explanations (Baker\n2005; Brigandt 2013; Mekios 2015). Some have argued that an updated\naccount of dynamic mechanistic explanations is required,\nhighlighting the importance of mathematical and computational modeling\nfor understanding non-linear dynamics, cyclic organization, and\ncomplex feedback relations (Bechtel & Abrahamsen 2011, 2012;\nBrigandt 2013). In this context, idealized models are important for\nunderstanding the organization of mechanisms within a larger network\nstructure (Bechtel 2015b; Levy & Bechtel 2013; van Eck &\nWright\n 2021).[8]\n\nAlthough much, or perhaps most, of the philosophical work on systems\nbiology has focused on explanation, one cannot assume that explanation\nis the sole aim of systems biology research (MacLeod & Nersessian\n2015; Kastenhofer 2013a,b). Design principle may not only explain how\nbiological functions are realized but also allow for explorations of\nwhether the same function could be realized in other or simpler ways\n(Briat et al. 2016). Thus, synthetic and systems biology also call for\nphilosophers to examine other epistemic aims, such as prediction,\ncontrol, and design, and well as theoretical and practical interests\nin understanding the minimal requirements for biological functions and\nlife itself.\n5. Social and Societal Implications\n5.1 Interdisciplinary Integration, Collaboration and Education\n\nLarge-scale interdisciplinary collaboration is increasingly\nhighlighted as a necessary requirement for addressing the grand\nchallenges of modern science and society (Vermeulen 2010; Calvert\n2010; Andersen 2016). Interdisciplinarity is a hallmark of systems and\nsynthetic biology, and both approaches offer rich sources for\nphilosophical analysis of the epistemic features of interdisciplinary\nintegration (O\u2019Malley & Soyer 2012), interdisciplinary\nidentities (Calvert 2012), and of large-scale collaboration across\ndifferent universities (Calvert & Frow 2015; for examples of\nlarge-scale projects see the list of internet resources below).\n\nStudying the prospects and challenges of interdisciplinary integration\nalso offers a window to the cognitive processes involved in\ninterdisciplinary problem-solving, where research cannot rely on a\nsingle theoretical framework (MacLeod & Nersessian 2013a,b).\nThrough this process, different epistemic ideals operating in\ncontemporary science often become apparent. While combining different\nconceptual frameworks can lead to innovation and scientific progress,\nthe existence of different epistemic cultures can also pose challenges\nfor interdisciplinary collaboration (Calvert & Fujimura 2011;\nCarusi 2011; Kastenhofer 2007). Philosophical analysis has been\nproposed to help facilitate collaboration in situations where\nepistemic standards clash. Philosophy of science can help explicate\nthe differences and the backgrounds for these, and uncover\n\u2018blind spots\u2019 considering the aims, values, constraints,\nand challenges of other disciplines (Nersessian 2017).\n\nOne divide that is commonly highlighted is the gap between\nexperimental biologists and modelers with a background in engineering,\nmathematics, or physics. Empirical analyses of collaborations between\nmodelers and experimentalists in systems biology show that these two\ngroups often have different views on what kinds of data and models are\nmost relevant (Joaquium et al. 2019; Nersessian 2017; Rowbottom 2011).\nFor instance, modelers may not be interested in studying biological\nsystems at the same level of detail as experimental biologists, and\nexperimentalists may find highly abstract and idealized models\ninspired by physics or engineering misleading (MacLeod 2018). From the\nperspective of engineers or physicists, the preoccupation with\nmolecular details involves a risk of missing out on dynamic patterns\nthat could be captured with more generic models, while\nexperimentalists may find that such generic models often lack\nspecificity or merely reproduce current biological knowledge. These\ndifferences may in part be grounded in different explanatory standards\nas also discussed in Section 4.2 (Fagan 2016; Green et al. 2015a).\n\nMaking explanatory standards and values more explicit, and clarifying\nthe relative prospects and limitations of different research\nstrategies, are ways in which philosophy of science could contribute\nto science and science education. At the same time, collaborative\npractices in synthetic and systems biology may call for an extension\nof the scope of philosophical analysis. Whereas philosophers\ntraditionally have focused on logical and argumentative relations in\nscientific texts, understanding collaborative practices in systems and\nsynthetic biology may further require the exploration of the\naesthetic, cognitive, and creative dimensions of scientific practice\n(Carusi 2011; Ginsberg et al. 2015). Important questions are which\naspects underlie choices of visualization strategies, and how the\nrepresentation of biological data through diagrams, heat maps, network\nmodels, or state spaces influence biological reasoning and\ncollaboration (Abrahamsen & Bechtel 2015; Carusi 2012; Jones &\nWolkenhauer 2012).\n5.2 Biology in the Digital Age\n\nThe emergence of systems biology and synthetic biology in the 21th\ncentury is to a large extent driven by the development of techniques\nand strategies for producing, digitalizing, collecting, disseminating,\nand standardizing data. A first step in these research practices is\noften to consult online databases or bio-ontologies that are used for\ndata sharing, data integration, annotation, and curation of\nexperimental datasets (Leonelli 2016). For instance, the search for\nnetwork motifs\n (Section 1.1.1)\n started with the development of network models based on data\ndownloaded from the database RegulonDB as well as other sources\n(Shen-Orr et al. 2002). Numerous databases, bio-ontologies, and\nsoftware tools have been developed, emphasizing the ideals of Open\nData and large-scale collaborative efforts (Leonelli 2013). These\npractices raise questions as to whether some projects within systems\nand synthetic biology may be described as \u2018big science\u2019\n(Vermeulen 2010), and about the epistemic and social implications of\ndata-intensive research practices and collaborations.\n\nOne debated issue is the extent to which big data will radically\nchange or even revolutionize scientific methods, shifting the focus\nfrom hypothesis-driven inquiry to data-driven discoveries (Mazzocchi\n2015). Whereas some have seen data-intensive strategies as a\ntheory-free approach (Allen 2001), others have argued that\ntheory\u00a0plays different, although not less important, roles in\ndata-intensive science (Leonelli 2016). In particular, big data\nbiology presents new opportunities for eliminative inferences and\nexploratory experiments (Ratti 2015). Moreover, since the aim of\nbio-ontologies is to provide a standardized language and repository\nfor shared information, choices concerning vocabulary and\ncategorizations become important philosophical topics, including\nwhether standardization is compatible with local data uses (Leonelli\n2016). Important philosophical questions include how choices\nconcerning collection, sampling, standardization, visualization, and\ninterpretation of data affect the result of the analysis.\nSpecifically, the results of correlation-based methods such as GWAS\nare sensitive to sampling procedures and specific statistical\nthresholds, and the clinical validity and utility of genetic\nbiomarkers is a debated issue (e.g., Hey 2015; Maher 2008; McPherson\nand Tybjaerg-Hansen 2016).\n\nFinally, data-intensive practices also have implications for the\ninstitutional organization of science, as exemplified by the push for\nopen access on one hand and commercial interests in big data on the\nother (Calvert & Frow 2015; Kastenhofer 2013a,b; Leonelli 2013,\n2014; Royal Society 2012; Vermeulen 2011). Data are often produced and\ncompiled without specific aims in mind and are used and reused for\nmultiple purposes, and scholars have stressed the need to reconsider\nthe relation between data and evidence, and between basic and applied\nscience. Moreover, as contexts for ownership of data change, also\nreward-systems in terms of authorship and credits may need to be\nreconsidered (Ankeny & Leonelli 2015).\n5.3 Applications and Ethical Issues\n\nSystems biology and synthetic biology are expected to help address\nsocietal challenges with payoffs for biomedical research, health care,\nand environmental resource management. While offering new exciting\npotentials, concerns have also been raised about the social and\nethical implications of the new techno-scientific strategies.\n\nSystems medicine, the medical application of systems biology, aims for\nmajor breakthroughs towards understanding of complex diseases such as\ncancer and heart conditions (Voit & Brigham 2008; Wolkenhauer et\nal. 2013). Ambitious projects within systems biology such as the\nVirtual Physiological Human raise intriguing questions about\nhow computational modeling will influence future biomedical research\n(Kohl & Noble 2009; Kolodkin et al. 2011; Hunter et al. 2013).\nMulti-scale cardiac models are already being developed with important\nimplications for the potential to address physiological variability,\nand for philosophical discussions of model validation and the relation\nbetween experiment and simulation (Carusi et al. 2012; Carusi\n2014).\n\nDevelopments in systems and synthetic biology have encouraged\nphilosophers to revisit traditional conceptions of disease as\ndysfunctional states (Holm 2013, 2014), or broken mechanisms (Gross\n2011). Rather than focusing on the function or dysfunction of specific\ngenes or molecular mechanisms, network approaches to disease may\nsuggest a more dynamic approach to disease that accounts for an\nincreasing number of integrated processes (Del Sol et al. 2010; Huang\net al. 2009). Cancer research is a major priority of systems biology\nresearch, and exemplifies a field where data-intensive approaches may\nbe needed to address biological complexity (Plutynski 2021).\nDevelopments in cancer genomics have revealed an astonishing diversity\nof tumor types, suggesting that finer-grained disease-categories and\nmore targeted treatments may be needed. This line of research has\nopened new research venues, such as the development of multi-action\nremedies targeting numerous disease-related pathways identified via\ngenomic analysis. The discovered diversity of mutations identified in\nsequenced tumors has, however, also led to heated debates on whether\nthe behavior and identity of cancer cells can fully be understood at\nthe molecular level. Some have stressed the need to move beyond\ngene-centric or cell-centric approaches and to consider cancer as a\nproblem of tissue-organization (Soto & Sonnenschein 2011).\nAlthough some systems biological explanations of cancer illustrate the\npossibility of integrating \u201ctop-down\u201d and\n\u201cbottom-up\u201d approaches (Bertolaso 2016; Plutynski and\nBertolaso 2018), systems biology research also displays a variety and\nsometimes conflicting approaches to cancer. These debates not only\nhave philosophical implications for discussions about reductionism but\nalso\u00a0practical implications for how cancer should be approached\nexperimentally and treated in clinical practice (Bertolaso 2011; Soto\net al. 2008).\n\nOne of the important problems in contemporary medicine is how to\naccount for patient-specific variation. Systems medicine is sometimes\nhighlighted as a route to personalized or precision medicine (Hood et\nal. 2015). The aim to personalize medicine is as old as the medical\nprofession itself, but it is now promoted through data-intensive\ncomputational strategies with exciting new potentials (Tutton 2014).\nProponents are optimistic that large-scale modeling of\npatient-specific data can result in a paradigm-shift from a\none-size-fits-all model in traditional medicine, toward a more\nefficient systemic approach that can tailor disease prevention,\ndiagnosis, and treatment to individual patients. Against this\noptimism, some have raised concerns about uncertainties and potential\nharmful results associated with genetic risk profiling, including the\nrisk of overdiagnosis and unnecessary medicalization of healthy\nindividuals (Green & Vogt 2016; Vogt et al. 2016, 2019).\nPhilosophers and social scientists have also critically examined how\nrisk information is communicated to the public by companies\ncapitalizing on personalized genomics, and discussed how such\ninformation may affect health outcomes and perceptions of health\n(Bartol 2013; Prainsack 2017; Reydon et al. 2012). More generally,\nsystems medicine has spurred debates about whether the vision to\npredict and control future health outcomes is compatible with a\nhumanistic approach to medicine and social complexity (Tutton 2014;\nVogt et al. 2014). Moreover, combination of systems medicine and\nsynthetic biology applications opens also for what O\u2019Malley\n(2011a) termed constructive personalized medicine, where\npredictive modeling and synthetic interventions are combined.\nPromising technologies for these purposes now include CRISPR-Cas9 gene\nediting, organ-on-chip models, 3D bioprinting and organoid-based\nmodels for replacement therapies. While creating unprecedented\npotentials for disease treatment, they also raise ethical questions\nabout artificial chimerism and human enhancement (Pio-Lopez 2021).\n\nIn the context of synthetic biology, discussions often center on\nwhether the attempt to create synthetic organisms and the use of\ndesign metaphors can compromise our perspective on and respect for\nlife (Christiansen 2016a; Douglas et al. 2013; McLeod and Nerlich\n2017). Other ethical debates consider the risk of negative\nconsequences of specific synthetic applications. Discussions often\ninvolve so-called dual-use problems where the benefits of genetically\nmodified organisms are weighted against potential problems and risks.\nExamples are biohazards associated with intentional or unintentional\nrelease of synthetic pathogens, or the possibility that synthetic\nproduction of biomedical compounds opens for efficient and inexpensive\nproduction of illegal drugs (Christiansen 2016b). Concerns have also\nbeen raised about the commercialization of biotechnologies. Examples\nare applications of broad patents concerning minimal genomes or\nsynthetic genes (O\u2019Malley et al. 2008), and considerations about\nstructural injustice if industrial production via synthetic organisms\noutcompete conventional farming in developing countries (Christiansen\n2016b). Thus, the strong push to address societal problems through\nsystems and synthetic biology gives rise to new exciting possibilities\nbut also calls for critical examination from philosophers and social\nscientists.\n6. Concluding Remarks\n\nSystems and synthetic biology are often described as distinguishable\nin their emphasis on analysis versus synthesis, but the ties to\nengineering approaches are complex and multi-faceted in both fields.\nSystems and synthetic biology have been addressed together in this\nentry because many scientific and philosophical issues overlap. Both\napproaches draw inspiration from engineering, mathematics, physics,\nand computer science, but in various different ways and towards the\ndifferent aims of understanding, predicting, and modifying biological\nsystems. Accordingly, both approaches provide excellent sources for\nphilosophical discussions of interdisciplinary integration,\nparticularly the implications of the increasing embedding of\nmathematical and computational approaches in biology. Some practices\nencourage philosophers to revisit classical philosophical topics such\nas reductionism and scientific explanation, but systems and synthetic\nbiology also broaden the scope of philosophical topics to include\ndata-intensive practices and modeling strategies towards the aims of\ndesign and control.\n\nSince this entry has examined the philosophical implications of both\nsystems biology and synthetic biology, much attention has been given\nto the implications of engineering approaches, including the quest for\nso-called design principles. It is, however, important to note that\nsystems biology and synthetic biology cover a broad spectrum of\nresearch practices, some of which are more strongly inspired by\nchemistry or physics than engineering. This entry should thus be taken\nas an attempt to only cover some ground of the vast philosophical\nlandscape that these research fields reach into. With the rapid\ndevelopment of both approaches and their explicit aim to address grand\nscientific and societal challenges, exciting times lie ahead for\nphilosophy of biology.",
