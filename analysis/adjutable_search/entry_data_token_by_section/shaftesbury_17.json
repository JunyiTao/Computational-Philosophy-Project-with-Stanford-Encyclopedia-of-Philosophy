    "main_text": "Religion || Natural religion, the argument from design, and justified enthusiasm\n7.3 Natural religion, the argument from design, and justified enthusiasm\n\nThe central feature of the positive aspect of Shaftesbury\u2019s\nreligion is belief in a perfectly good God based on an argument from\ndesign. (At C 2.364\u20135, he suggests that it is possible to give\nan a priori argument for the existence of God as well). Proper\nattention to the magnificent order of natural phenomena, Shaftesbury\nargues, leads inevitably to the conclusion that the world was created\nby a perfect being. If we found a perfectly designed piece of\narchitecture on a desert island, we would conclude that a mind had\nformed it even if we could see no intelligent being in the area. Just\nso, Shaftesbury argues, we must conclude that a mind has formed the\nworld as a whole, even though such a mind is not present to our\nsenses. Shaftesbury develops this argument most fully in The\nMoralists, in which Theocles convinces Philocles that perfect\ntheism follows from an understanding of nature as a whole (C\n2.284\u20135, 2.340\u2013393). Everything is \u201cfitted and\njoin\u2019d\u201d together, Theocles contends, each contributing to\nthe \u201cOrder, Union, and Coherence of the Whole\u201d (C\n2.287). \u201cAll we can see either of the Heavens or Earth,\ndemonstrates Order and Perfection\u201d (C 2.291). \u201cAll things\nin this world are united\u201d in a \u201cuniversal\nsystem\u201d (C 2.287). And\n\n\nhaving recogniz\u2019d this uniform consistent fabric, and\nown\u2019d the Universal System, we must of consequence\nacknowledg a universal Mind. (C 2.290)\n\n\nShaftesbury contends that such considerations\u2014the argument from\ndesign\u2014constitute a rational basis for theism. They provide\n\u201cabundant Proof, capable of convincing any fair and just\nContemplator\u201d (C 2.288).\n\nShaftesbury also insists, however, that essential to true religion is\na passionate love for the Divine and its creation. Shaftesbury\u2019s\nreligion consists not merely of a calm belief in a creator-God but\nalso of a passionate \u201cAdmiration\u201d of the\nworld\u2019s \u201cMajesty or Graudure,\u201d of\nsomething that \u201ccaptivates the Heart\u201d (C 3.31\u20132).\nIndeed, in what may seem like a surprising twist, Shaftesbury says\nthat in fact the truly religious frame of mind, because it reaches\nbeyond calm understanding, is a kind of enthusiasm. The writer of\nA Letter concerning Enthusiasm, after ridiculing enthusiasts\nthroughout, eventually claims to have \u201cjustify\u2019d Enthusiasm,\nand own\u2019d the Word\u201d and\nsigns off as \u201cyour Enthusiastick Friend\u201d (C 1.55;\nsee also 2.206\u201310, 368\u2013376, 218\u20139, 124, 220, 394;\n3.22, 33). It seems that Shaftesbury wants to develop a religious view\nthat is neither entirely passionate (like the fanatics he ridicules in\nA Letter) nor entirely rational (like the Deists he was\nsometimes associated with). This raises the question of how the\npassionate and rational elements of Shaftesbury\u2019s religion fit\ntogether.\n\nM\u00fcller (2010a) argues that for Shaftesbury the passionate element\nis necessary because rationality cannot fully establish the existence\nof a perfectly good God. Liu (2004), and McAteer (2016) are in\nsubstantial agreement. Reason alone, on this view, cannot get us all\nthe way to perfect theism. The extra distance can be traversed only by\nan emotional aesthetic response to the beauty of creation. M\u00fcller\nwrites,\n\n\nIn contemplating the beauty of nature, fancy transcends the limits of\nthe human mind and ascends into the infinite, imagining the harmonious\nconcatenation of causes. Theocles\u2019 sublime meditations do not\nattempt to produce logically sound arguments; they are allegorical\nverbal paintings of the deity\u2019s creation. The order of the\ndivine cosmos, its inherent goodness, does not lend itself to strict\nphilosophical investigation so that its \u201cMysterious\nBeauty\u201d (C 2.393) cannot be rationally understood by\nhuman beings. (M\u00fcller 2010: 224)\n\n\nThere are \u201csecret truths of divine creation\u201d that we can\nappreciate only through non-rational means (M\u00fcller 2010: 224).\nM\u00fcller argues for this interpretation through an account of\nShaftesbury\u2019s theodicy, i.e., his response to the seeming evils\nin a world supposedly created by a perfectly good, omnipotent God.\nAccording to M\u00fcller, Shaftesbury contends that belief in such a\nGod implies that no real evil can truly exists. All evil is merely\napparent. Everything in the world is actually entirely good. But this\nposition cannot be established rationally. Indeed, according to\nM\u00fcller, this position is \u201canti-rational\u201d (M\u00fcller\n2010: 227). We can only come to accept it through an emotional\naesthetic response\u2014an imaginative \u201cConceit of something\nmajestick\u201d (C 3.30), an \u201cExtasy\u201d (C\n1.36)\u2014to the beauty of the world.\n\nGrean, in contrast, takes Shaftesbury to advance a more thoroughly\nrational basis for perfect theism (Grean 1967: 19\u201336). On\nGrean\u2019s interpretation, an enthusiastic passion is \u201cfair\nand plausible\u201d only if it is tethered to a thoroughly rational\ntheological understanding, not if it goes beyond such an\nunderstanding. Such a reading emphasizes statements such as the\nfollowing from Philocles:\n\n\nNor cou\u2019d God witness for himself, or assert his Being\nany other way to Men, than \u201cBy revealing himself to their\nReason, appealing to their Judgment, and submitting\nhis Ways to their Censure, and cool\nDeliberation\u201d (C 2.333).\n\n\nTheocles also seems to eschew the need for any non-rational means to\ntheism when he says that observation provides \u201cabundant Proof,\ncapable of convincing any fair and just Contemplator, of the Works of\nNature\u201d (C 2.288). In addition, Shaftesbury condemns the idea\nthat a person should ever believe anything not supported by \u201can\nimpartial Use of his Reason\u201d or that is \u201ctoo hard for his\nUnderstanding\u201d (C 1.35). Contemplation of the order of things is\n\u201cthe only means which cou\u2019d establish the sound\nBelief of a Deity\u201d (C 2.333). Without fully rational\nbelief, \u201cTheology must have no Foundation at all\u201d (C\n2.269).\n\nShaftesbury does believe that true theism involves an emotional\nresponse\u2014that a truly religious frame of mind includes something\nmore than simply a calm, rational belief in Deity (at which the Deists\nmight have been satisfied to stop). But on Grean\u2019s\ninterpretation, that additional emotional element is added to rational\nbelief, not something that is needed to carry us to a belief that\nreason alone cannot reach. The model for this kind of emotional\nelement is the profound aesthetic pleasure that a mathematician may\nexperience upon coming to understand an elegant proof, or that a\nbiologist may experience upon coming to understand the perfect\norganization of a complex set of features of an organism or ecosystem\n(C 2.17 and 2.43). The profound aesthetic pleasure of the\nmathematician and the biologist does not go beyond understanding but,\nrather, is entirely posterior to, dependent on it (C\n2.374\u20135).\n\nIt is true\u2014as M\u00fcller, Liu, and McAteer point out\u2014that\nShaftesbury thinks there are certain things that appear to us to be\nbad or evil, things that we cannot understand how to reconcile with a\nperfectly good and all-powerful God. But there is in Shaftesbury an\nattempt at a rational argument for the conclusion that even those\nthings are actually for the best (C 2.288\u201392, 2.363\u20135).\nThere are numerous features of the world whose purpose we have not\ninitially understood. Over time, however, we have come to see the\npurpose that many of those things serve, achieving a rational\nrealization that what had initially seemed bad or evil is in actuality\nentirely to the good. But since we have had so many of these\nexperiences in the past\u2014of initially not understanding a thing\nand its appearing to us to be bad or evil, and of then coming to\nunderstand it and realizing that it is in fact good\u2014it is\nreasonable to conclude that those things we currently do not\nunderstand and that appear to us as evil are also actually for the\nbest. Imagine you know a very brilliant person. In the past she has\ndone things you initially did not understand the rationale for at all.\nBut in time you eventually came to see that those things were\nperfectly planned and executed, and you now realize that they were\nexactly the right things to have done (even if you hadn\u2019t been\nable to see that initially). Now imagine that this person does\nsomething in the present that you do not understand the rationale for.\nYour past experience gives you reasonable grounds for trusting that in\nfact she has perfect justification for what she is doing\u2014that\nher actions really are for the best, even if you currently cannot see\nthe reasons for them. Given the finiteness of our minds and the\ninfiniteness of God\u2019s, it is only to be expected that God acts\nin certain ways we cannot understand. But in the past we have had so\nmany experiences of examining natural objects we initially did not\nunderstand and coming to see the harmonious workings of all their\nwondrous mechanisms, it is reasonable to believe that those things we\ncurrently do not understand are in fact for the best. As Shaftesbury\nputs it,\n\n\nNow, in this mighty Union, if there be such\nRelations of Parts one to another as are not easily discover\u2019d;\nif on this account the End and Use of Things does not every-where\nappear, there is no wonder; since \u2019tis no more indeed than what\nmust happen of necessity: Nor cou\u2019d supreme Wisdom have\notherwise order\u2019d it. For in an Infinity of Things thus\nrelative, a Mind which sees not infinitely, can see nothing\nfully. (C 2.288)\n\n",
