We\nshall successively strengthen Z0 by reflectively adding axioms that\nassert certain levels of the universe of sets exist.\n\n\nThe standard model of Z0 is V\u03c9.  The Axiom of Infinity (in\none formulation) simply asserts that this set exists.  So, when we add\nthe Axiom of Infinity, the resulting theory Z1 (known as Zermelo\nset theory with Choice) not only proves the consistency of Z0; it\nproves that there is a standard model of Z0.  Now the standard\nmodel of Z1 is V\u03c9+\u03c9.  The Axiom of Replacement\nimplies that this set exists.  So, when we add the Axiom of\nReplacement, the resulting theory Z2 (known as ZFC), not only\nproves the consistency of Z1; it proves that there is a standard\nmodel of Z1.\n\n\nA standard model of Z2 has the\nform V\u03ba where \u03ba is a regular cardinal\nsuch that for all \u03b1 < \u03ba, 2\u03b1 <\n\u03ba.  Such a cardinal is called a\n(strongly) inaccessible cardinal.  The next axiom in\nthe hierarchy under consideration is the statement asserting that such\na cardinal exists.  The resulting theory \n ZFC + \u201cThere is a\nstrongly inaccessible cardinal\u201d proves that there is a level of\nthe universe that satisfies ZFC.  Continuing in this fashion one\narrives at stronger and stronger axioms that assert the existence of\nlarger and larger levels of the universe of sets.  Before continuing\nwith an outline of such axioms let us first draw the connection with\nthe hierarchy of interpretability.\n\n\nRecall our classification of the three types of independence.  We\nnoted that there are no known natural examples of the third kind of\nindependence but that there are natural examples of the first and\nsecond kind of independence.\n\n\nNatural examples of the second kind of independence are provided by\nthe dual method of inner and outer models.  For example, these methods\nshow that the theories ZFC+CH and ZFC+ \u00acCH are mutually\ninterpretable with ZFC, that is, all three theories lie in the same\ndegree.  In other words, CH is an Orey sentence with respect to\nZFC.  What about that other sentence we introduced: PM?\n\n\nUsing the method of inner models G\u00f6del showed that \u00acPM holds\nin L.  It follows that ZFC+ \u00acPM is mutually interpretable with\nZFC.  But what about PM?  To show that ZFC+PM is mutually\ninterpretable with ZFC a natural approach would be to follow the\napproach used for CH and build an outer model of ZFC that\nsatisfies PM.  However, it is known that this cannot be done\nstarting with ZFC alone.  For it turns out (by a result of\nShelah (1984)) that ZFC+PM implies the consistency of\nZFC and this implies, by the second incompleteness theorem, that\nZFC+PM is not interpretable in ZFC.  In a sense we have here a\ncase of the independence of independence.  More precisely, even if we\nassume that ZFC is consistent we cannot (in contrast to the case of\nCH) prove that PM is independent of ZFC.  To establish the\nindependence of PM from ZFC we need to assume the consistency of\na stronger theory, namely, that of \n ZFC + \u201cThere is a strongly inaccessible\ncardinal\u201d.  For it turns out that ZFC+PM lies not in the\ninterpretability degree of ZFC but rather in that\nof ZFC + \u201cThere is a strongly\ninaccessible cardinal\u201d.  To summarize: While CH is a case of the\nsecond type independence, PM is a case of the first type independence;\nit is similar to Con(ZFC) in that it is a sentence \u03c6 such that\nonly one of \u03c6 or \u00ac\u03c6 leads to a jump in strength, only now\nthere are two differences; the jump lands in a degree that is much\nstronger and it is represented by a natural theory.\n\n\nIn general, the (known) sentences of set theory are either like CH\nor PM.  Some are like CH in that both ZFC+\u03c6 and\nZFC+ \u00ac\u03c6 lie in the degree of ZFC.  Others are like PM in\nthat one of ZFC+\u03c6 and ZFC+ \u00ac\u03c6 lies in the degree of\nZFC while the other lies in the degree of an extension of ZFC\nvia a large cardinal axiom.\n\n\nLet us now return to our overview of large cardinal axioms.  After\nstrongly inaccessible cardinals there are Mahlo cardinals,\nindescribable cardinals, and ineffable cardinals.  All of these large\ncardinal axioms can be derived in a uniform way using the traditional\nvariety of reflection principles (see Tait 2005) but there\nare limitations on how far this variety of reflection principles can\ntake one.  For under a very general characterization of such\nprinciples it is known that they cannot yield the Erd\u0151s cardinal\n\u03ba(\u03c9).  See Koellner (2009).\n\n\nThe large cardinals considered thus far (including \u03ba(\u03c9))\nare known as small large cardinals.  A large cardinal is small if the associated large cardinal axiom can hold in\nG\u00f6del's constructible universe L, that is, if \n \u201cV \u22a8 \u03ba is a\n\u03c6-cardinal\u201d is consistent, then \n \u201cL \u22a8 \u03ba is a\n\u03c6-cardinal\u201d is consistent.  Otherwise the large cardinal is large.\n\n\nThere is a simple template for formulating (large) large cardinal\naxioms is in terms of elementary embeddings.  In general such an axiom\nasserts that there is a transitive class M and a non-trivial\nelementary embedding\n\nj : V \u2192 M.\n\n\n\nTo say that the embedding is non-trivial is just to say that it is not\nthe identity, in which case there must be a least ordinal that is\nmoved.  This ordinal is called the critical point of j and\ndenoted crit(j).  The critical point is (typically) the large\ncardinal associated with the embedding.  A cardinal \u03ba is said to be\nmeasurable iff it is the critical point of some such\nembedding.[8]\n\n\n\nIt is easy to see that for any such\nembedding V\u03ba+1\u2286 M where\n\u03ba = crit(j).  This amount of agreement enables one to\nshow that \u03ba is strongly inaccessible, Mahlo, indescribable,\nineffable, etc.  To illustrate this let us assume that we have shown\nthat \u03ba is strongly inaccessible and let us show that \u03ba has\nmuch stronger large cardinal properties.  Since \u03ba is strongly\ninaccessible in V and since\n(V\u03ba+1)M\n=V\u03ba+1, M also thinks that \u03ba\nis strongly inaccessible.  In particular, M thinks that there\nis a strongly inaccessible cardinal (namely, \u03ba)\nbelow j(\u03ba).  But then by the elementarity of\nj, V must think the same thing of the preimage of\nj(\u03ba), namely, \u03ba, that is, V must think that\nthere is a strongly inaccessible below \u03ba.  So \u03ba cannot\nbe the least strongly inaccessible cardinal.  Continuing in this\nmanner one can show that there are many strongly inaccessibles below\n\u03ba and, in fact, that \u03ba is Mahlo, indescribable,\nineffable, etc.  So measurable cardinals subsume the small large\ncardinals.\n\n\nIn fact, Scott showed that (in contrast to the small large cardinals)\nmeasurable cardinals cannot exist in G\u00f6del's constructible universe.\nLet us be precise about this.  Let V=L be the statement that\nasserts that all sets are constructible.  Then for each small large\ncardinal axiom \u03c6 (to be precise, those listed above) if the\ntheory ZFC+\u03c6 is consistent then so is the theory\nZFC+\u03c6+V=L.  In contrast, the theory ZFC + \u201cThere is a\nmeasurable cardinal\u201d proves \u00acV=L.  This may seem somewhat\ncounterintuitive since L contains all of the ordinals and so if \u03ba\nis a measurable cardinal then \u03ba is an ordinal in L.  The point is\nthat L cannot \u201crecognize\u201d that \u03ba is a measurable cardinal since\nit is too \u201cthin\u201d to contain the ultrafilter that witnesses the\nmeasurability of \u03ba.\n\n\nOne way to strengthen a large cardinal axiom based on the above\ntemplate is to demand greater agreement between M and V.  For\nexample, if one demands that V\u03ba+2\u2286 M then the fact that\n\u03ba is measurable (something witnessed by a subset of P(\u03ba))\ncan be recognized by M.  And so, by exactly the same argument that\nwe used above, there must be a measurable cardinal below \u03ba.\n\n\nThis leads to a progression of increasingly strong large cardinal\naxioms.  It will be useful to discuss some of the major stepping\nstones in this hierarchy.\n\n\nIf \u03ba is a cardinal and \u03b7>\u03ba is an ordinal then\n\u03ba is \u03b7-strong if there is a transitive\nclass M and a non-trivial elementary embedding\nj: V \u2192 M such that crit(j)=\u03ba,\nj(\u03ba)>\u03b7\nand V\u03b7\u2286 M.  A cardinal \u03ba\nis strong iff it is \u03b7-strong for all \u03b7>\u03ba.\nOne can also demand that the embedding preserve certain classes:\nIf A is a class, \u03ba is a cardinal, and \u03b7>\u03ba\nis an ordinal then \u03ba is \u03b7-A-strong if\nthere exists a j: V \u2192 M which witnesses that \u03ba\nis \u03b7-strong and which has the additional feature that\nj(A \u2229 V\u03ba)\n\u2229 V\u03b7 = A\n\u2229 V\u03b7.  The following large cardinal notion\nplays a central role in the search for new axioms.\n\nDefinition 3.1.\n\n  A cardinal \u03ba is a Woodin cardinal if \u03ba is strongly\n  inaccessible and for all A\u2286 V\u03ba  there is a cardinal\n  \u03baA < \u03ba such that\n\n  \n  \u03baA is \u03b7-A-strong,\n   \n\nfor each \u03b7 such that \u03baA < \u03b7 < \u03ba.[9]\n\n\n\nOne can obtain stronger large cardinal axioms by forging a link\nbetween the embedding j and the amount of resemblance between M\nand V.  For example, a cardinal \u03ba is superstrong if there\nis a transitive class M and a non-trivial elementary embedding\nj: V \u2192 M such that crit(j)=\u03ba and \n Vj(\u03ba)\u2286 M.  If \u03ba is\nsuperstrong then \u03ba is a Woodin cardinal and there are arbitrarily\nlarge Woodin cardinals below \u03ba. \n\n\nOne can also obtain strong large cardinal axioms by placing closure\nconditions on the target model M.  For example, letting \u03b3\u00a0\u2265\u00a0\u03ba a\ncardinal \u03ba is \u03b3-supercompact if there is a\ntransitive class M and a non-trivial elementary embedding j: V \u2192 M\nsuch that crit(j)=\u03ba and \u03b3M\u2286 M, that is, M is closed\nunder \u03b3-sequences.  (It is straightforward to see that if M is\nclosed under \u03b3-sequences then H(\u03b3+)\u2286 M; so this approach\nsubsumes the previous approach.) A cardinal \u03ba is supercompact if it is \u03b3-supercompact for all \u03b3 \u2265 \u03ba.  Now,\njust as in the previous approach, one can strengthen these axioms by\nforging a link between the embedding j and the closure conditions on\nthe target model.  A cardinal \u03ba is n-huge if there is\na transitive class M and a non-trivial elementary embedding j:V \u2192\nM such that j\u2009n(\u03ba)M\u00a0\u2286\u00a0M, where \u03ba=crit(j) and\nj\u2009i+1(\u03ba) is defined to be j(j\u2009i(\u03ba)). \n\n\nOne can continue in this vein, demanding greater agreement between M\nand V.  The ultimate axiom in this direction would, of course,\ndemand that M = V.  This axiom was proposed by Reinhardt and shortly\nthereafter shown to be inconsistent (in ZFC) by Kunen.  In fact,\nKunen showed that, assuming ZFC, there can be a transitive class\nM and a non-trivial elementary\nembedding j: V \u2192 M such that\nj \u2018\u2018 \u03bb \u2208 M, where \n \u03bb=supn < \u03c9\u2009j\u2009n(\u03ba) and\n\u03ba=crit(j).  In particular, there cannot exists such\nan M and\nj such that V\u03bb+1\u2286 M.  This placed a limit on the\namount of closure of the target model (in relation to the\nembedding).[10]\n\n\n\nNevertheless, there is a lot of room below the above upper bound.  For\nexample, a very strong axiom is the statement that there is a\nnon-trivial elementary embedding j:V\u03bb+1\u2192 V\u03bb+1.  The\nstrongest large cardinal axiom in the current literature is the axiom\nasserting that there is a non-trivial elementary embedding\nj: L(V\u03bb+1)\u2192 L(V\u03bb+1) such that crit(j)<\u03bb.  In recent\nwork, Woodin has discovered axioms much stronger than this.\n\nFurther Reading: For more on large cardinal axioms\nsee Kanamori (2003).\n",
