    "main_text": "Methodological: Epistemology Naturalized, Reflective Equilibrium, Rational Choice, and Pragmatic Naturalism || Pragmatic Naturalism\n5.3 Pragmatic Naturalism\n\n\nBuilding on the pioneering work of American pragmatists, notably\nWilliam James (James 1907) and John Dewey (Dewey 1922; Dewey &\nTufts 1932), Philip Kitcher (Kitcher 2011a) has recently revitalized\nthe pragmatic, naturalistic approach to moral knowledge evident in\nearlier thinkers. (For his general defence of pragmatism, see his\npapers in Kitcher 2012.) Like naturalized epistemology,\n\u201cpragmatic naturalism\u201d, to use his term, eschews appeal to\na priori knowledge but also rejects the ideal of moral knowledge of a\nreality to be discovered in nature that is static and not under human\ncontrol. Pragmatic naturalism is thus distinct from ontological\nnaturalism already discussed above in 3.3. Though principles of\nrational choice can play a role in moral learning on this view, all\nprinciples are open to revision and, more importantly, grounds for\nmoral change need not appeal to a reflective equilibrium of principles\nand judgments. Instead, moral knowledge is part of a long cultural\nevolutionary process of humans working out among themselves how they\ncan live together, initially in small groups, through imposing\nconstraints on their interactions and setting goals consistent with\nthem that they can strive toward collectively. Moral knowledge is\nmoral \u201cknow-how\u201d that emerges first out of primitive tendencies\nfashioned by natural selection and from cooperative efforts within\ngroups to live peacefully while competing for resources with other\ngroups. Alliances between groups form when necessary and in some cases\ncodes of conduct apply to allied groups. Humans achieve moral\nprogress, not by discovering truth that exists apart from their\nsocieties, but by fulfilling the various functions of ethical norms as\nthese functions gradually emerge through engagement in \u201cthe ethical\nproject\u201d.\n\n\nSuch pragmatic naturalism, as moral epistemology, has strong\naffinities with the methodologies just canvassed and shares many of\ntheir virtues. For example, when discussing cases of moral progress,\nsuch as the abolition of slavery in the United States and improvement\nover the last century in civil status of women in Europe and the\nUnited States, Kitcher focuses on the reasons for moral change that\nwere in fact operating in these cases rather than on principles that\nmight rationalize the changes without necessarily explaining\nthem. Like naturalized epistemology the focus is on looking for the\nreasons that are also causes. Like reflective equilibrium theory and\nrational choice theory, the focus is sensitive to tensions within\nmoral perspectives both theoretical and practical, such as the\napparent contradiction of maintaining the view that women as wives and\nmothers should not be educated while having to concede, as Mary\nWollstonecraft argued (Kitcher 2011a, 148\u201350), that they would better\nfulfill their role in their families if they were educated or, as John\nWoolman pointed out (Kitcher 2011a, 158\u201361), maintaining a Christian\nview of the equal worth of every human while tolerating chattel\nslavery. Kitcher\u2019s argument in these and similar cases is that\nimprovement in moral knowledge was not achieved through the use of\ngeneral abstract principles but has depended instead on reconciling\nconflicts of moral values so that their emerging functions are better\nserved. See also Elizabeth Anderson\u2019s discussion of how people learned\nthat slavery is wrong (Anderson 2016). At the same time,\nbecause pragmatists, such as Kitcher and Anderson, focus on cases of\nradical moral change from the status quo, the charge of moral\nconservatism that faces reflective equilibrium and rational choices\ntheories of moral knowledge tends to be undercut.\n\n\nWe have to ask, however, whether pragmatic naturalism is a method that\nyields genuine moral knowledge, since it seems to replace reference to\nknowledge of moral truth with knowledge of the practical means for\nresolving human conflict. Are not the two very different? Is not this\npragmatic understanding of moral knowledge, for all its virtues, an\nimpostor that really fails to signify something that has the\ntranscendent moral authority that we intuitively associate with\ngenuine moral truth? There is ample experimental work confirming that\nall of us, including children, are able to distinguish conventional\nauthority from moral authority, where the latter is understood to take\nprecedence over what is claimed to be right by those in positions of\nauthority within a society or what current norms viewed as\nauthoritative are thought to imply (Nichols 2004). If that were not\nso, it would have made no sense for advocates of moral change to hold\nthat conventional moral authority was violating the moral rights of\nhumans treated as property or unworthy of education. Kitcher tries to\naddress this problem by arguing that pragmatic naturalism allows a\nrobust conception of moral truth but one that is not prior to our\nunderstanding of moral progress (Kitcher 2011a, 245\u20139). Another way to\naddress the problem would be to conceive of moral truth so that it\ndoes not imply a realist conception of moral truth but one that is\nrobustly objective in that it allows the possibility of massive moral\nerror among would-be knowers despite all efforts to know the truth\n(Campbell & Kumar 2013). Truth has been a central concern to\npragmatism from its inception (Misak 2013) and the problem of moral\ntruth bears critically on the viability of pragmatic naturalism as a\nmethodology for understanding the possibility of moral knowledge.\n",
