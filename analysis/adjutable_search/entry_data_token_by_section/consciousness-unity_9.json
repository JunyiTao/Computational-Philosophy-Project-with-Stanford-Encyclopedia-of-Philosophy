    "main_text": "Disorders of Unified Consciousness || Do the Conditions have a Common Structure?\n4.2 Do the Conditions have a Common Structure?\n\nCan a single structure account for what is going on in all these\nphenomena? The Kantian taxonomy of forms of unified consciousness\nconsidered in\n Section 2.2\n can give us a way into this issue. \n\nAs we said earlier, one natural way to think of the conditions just\nsketched is to break them into two groups. In one group, however\ndrastic the change in unified consciousness, unified consciousness\nremains in a largely complete form. Arguably, this group would include\nbrain bisection cases, hemi-neglect, anosognosia, and DID. In the\nsecond group, schizophrenia of the severe kind we sketched,\ndysexecutive disorder, and simultagnosia, it is more natural to think\nthat unified consciousness has been damaged or even destroyed. \n\nBrain bisection cases first. On the standard way of conceptualizing\nthese cases, the key evidence for a duality of some kind is that there\nappear to be situations in which whatever is conscious of some items\nbeing experienced in the body in question is not conscious of other\nitems being experienced in that same body at the same time. We looked\nat two examples of the phenomenon in\n Section 4.1,\n the word TAXABLE and the doing of arithmetic. With respect to these\nexperienced items, there is a significant and systematically\nextendable situation in which to be conscious of some of these items\nis not to be conscious of others of them in a single unified\nconsciousness where we would expect such consciousness. If so, brain\nbisection patients fail to meet the conditions for unified\nconsciousness of contents. This seems to be what motivates the\njudgment that these patients have two centres of consciousness. \n\nLet us describe the case a bit more precisely. On the standard\naccount, a brain bisection patient could be conscious that both TAX\nand ABLE are being seen. But nothing in the patient would be conscious\nthat both items are being seen on the basis of seeing them.\nFor at least one of the two items, one of the two centres of\nconsciousness could have only the same kind of behavioural and other\n\u2018outside\u2019 evidence that any observer of the situation\ncould have. \n\nIndeed, the apparent split runs still deeper. Between the two\nhemispheres there seems to be a split in unified consciousness of\nexperiencing, too: Consciousness of doing some experiencing\ngoes with lack of consciousness of doing other experiencing that is\ngoing on in the same body. To use a useful metaphor first coined, so\nfar as we know, by Shoemaker, something is not conscious of acts of\nexperiencing going on in its body \u2018from the inside\u2019, i.e.,\non the basis of doing them, while something else is conscious\nof them on this basis. There seems to be a split in unified\nconsciousness of self, too: Consciousness of oneself as\nsubject on the basis of doing acts of experiencing in that body goes\nwith lack of consciousness of oneself as subject on the basis of other\nacts of experiencing being done in that body. If so, for many\nconscious states in these patients, there two instances of\n joint consciousness (section 2.1.3),\n not the normal one.\n\nTo be sure, this assessment is not universally accepted. As we saw,\nBayne and Chalmers (2003) and Bayne (2010: ch. 9) urge that while\naccess unity is split in these patients, phenomenal unity need not be.\nWhy not? Because there may be no duality of unified consciousness at\nany given time. Rather, a single instance of unified consciousness may\nbe switching back and forth between the material in the two\nhemispheres. As Schechter (2012) has urged, evidence of a simultaneous\nduality of consciousness would be a major problem for this\napproach. We will not attempt to assess the relevant evidence here\n(see Brook 2015 for further discussion). Even if Bayne is right, that\nshould not affect the prospects of a unified account of disorders of\nunified consciousness\u2014what is going on in brain bisection cases\nwould not be a disorder of unified consciousness! \n\nNext, dissociative identity disorder (DID). (We will take up\nhemi-neglect and anosognosia shortly.) In cases of DID, a central\nfeature is either some pattern of reciprocal amnesia or a strong sense\nthat another is inside (and yet still separate). This again seems to\nbe a situation in which being conscious of some experienced objects by\nhaving the experience goes with not being conscious of others in the\nsame body in the same way. The main difference is that the breach\nseems to be at a time in brain bisection cases, but can be either\nacross time or at a time in DID cases. If so, the breakdown in unity\nwill again consist in breakdowns of joint consciousness. The amnesia\nin diachronic DID has this character, clearly (and, except for the\namnesia, is in line with Bayne\u2019s (2010) switch model), but so\ndoes synchronic DID. The person and the \u2018little person\ninside\u2019 have no access from the inside to each other, so no\ncommon unified consciousness of experiencing, and the objects of their\nexperience are not unified, so no common unified consciousness of\ncontents. \n\nNow the second group. For severe schizophrenia, dysexecutive syndrome,\nand simultagnosia/Balint\u2019s syndrome\u2014the cases where\nconsciousness seems to be more shattered than split\u2014the\ndistinction of Kant\u2019s that we introduced in\n Section 2.2\n between two kinds of synthesis is useful. As we saw, Kant\ndistinguishes between the synthesis that gives us consciousness of\nindividual objects (Tye\u2019s object unity) and the synthesis that\ngives us consciousness of a number of objects at the same time. \n\nThis distinction seems to shed some interesting light on the three\nphenomena. The evidence suggests that the first kind of synthesis\ncontinues to be available to dysexecutive and simultagnosia patients:\nthey continue to be conscious of individual objects, events, etc. The\ndamage seems to be with respect to the second kind, being conscious of\nmultiple objects in a single act of consciousness. These people seem\nto achieve some measure of unified focal attention with respect to\nindividual objects but unified consciousness of multiple objects is\neither restricted or missing.\n\nWith the severe forms of schizophrenia that we sketched, patients may\nlack even the ability to perform the first kind of synthesis. In a\ndifferent jargon, these people may lack even the capacity for object\nconstancy. \n\nOn this analysis, hemi-neglect and anosognosia are a bit different\nfrom the other conditions. Here there is no apparent breach of joint\nconsciousness. Neither a split nor a breakdown in unified\nconsciousness is evident. Rather, in both conditions, there appears to\nbe a shrinking of the array of phenomena over which otherwise intact\njoint consciousness can range. Half of one\u2019s body and/or half of\nall perceived objects are excluded in the first condition, the actual\nsituation with respect to sight, limbs, etc., in the second. \n\nTo sum up, it appears that there is some prospect of placing all the\nconditions we have considered within a single structure of (Kantian)\ndistinctions, first between unified consciousness of contents and\nunified consciousness of experiencing, then between conscious\nexperience of individual objects and unified conscious experience of\nmultiple objects. Thought insertion might pose a problem for this\nscheme. Patients experience thought insertion when they believe that\nsome of their thoughts, experiences, emotions, and so on are not their\nown and have been \u2018inserted\u2019 into them from without.\nPeople suffering it are still aware of the \u2018alien\u2019\nthoughts from the point of view of having them. The deficit is in\nsomething to do with thinking of these thoughts as unified with the\nrest of conscious life. Normally, we think of ourselves as the subject\nand agent of all our experiences. In thought insertion, the victim\ndoes not appear to himself to be either subject or agent of some of\nthe experiences of which he is in fact the subject and agent\n(Mylopoulos 2015).\n",
