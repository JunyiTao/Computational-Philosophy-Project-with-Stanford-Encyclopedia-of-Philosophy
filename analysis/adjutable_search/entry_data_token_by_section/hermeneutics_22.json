    "main_text": "Further Developments || Hermeneutics in Anglo-American Philosophy\n8.1 Hermeneutics in Anglo-American Philosophy\n\nHermeneutics, grasped as a historical movement, is typically\nassociated with continental European traditions of thought and the\nreception of these traditions in the global context. This reception\nhas included contributions to the development of hermeneutics made by\nnoteworthy Anglo-American philosophers. Hermeneutics has been adopted\nby Richard Rorty, has been connected with the later Wittgenstein and\nDavidson, and has also been taken up by philosophers associated with\nthe so-called \u2018Pittsburgh school,\u2019 Robert Brandom, and\nJohn\n McDowell.[11]\n\nRorty, in his now classic Philosophy and the Mirror of\nNature, presents a ranging critique of modern philosophy that\nfocuses on epistemology, especially the idea that knowledge is a\nrepresentation or mental \u2018mirroring\u2019 of mind-independent\nreality. Against epistemology, Rorty proposes hermeneutics, which he\ncharacterizes as \u201can expression of hope that the cultural space\nleft behind by the demise of epistemology will not be\nfilled\u2026\u201d (Rorty 1979, 315). Hermeneutics holds this void\nopen with what he calls \u2018conversation.\u2019 In this,\nconversation pursues not the truth, conceived as a correspondence of\nmind and mind-independent reality, but, instead, edification (Rorty\n1979, 318, 360, 378). Edification, itself Rorty\u2019s proposed\ntranslation of the German Bildung (Piercy 2016, 447) concerns\nnot truth, then, but instead the discovery of new and useful\npossibilities.\n\nPhilosophers associated with the University of Pittsburgh have also\ntaken up and developed themes in hermeneutics. Robert Brandom, for his\npart, has argued that his inferentialist approach in semantics is able\nto support major tenets of Gadamerian hermeneutics, thereby suggesting\nthat the traditions of inferentialism and hermeneutics can complement\none another (see Brandom 2002 and 2004; see also Lafont 2007). John\nMcDowell, in his Mind and World, also introduces a notion\nconnected with hermeneutics. In this text, McDowell wishes to resolve\nthe question of how the mind, ultimately, in the\n\u2018spontaneity\u2019 or freedom of reason, relates to the world.\nHe argues that the question itself is a symptom of naturalism, the\nidea typical of modern science that immutable laws govern everything\nin nature. In this, the worry about the place of the spontaneity of\nreason in nature arises precisely from our reductive conception of\nnature in the first place. McDowell resolves the question of the\nrelation of reason and nature, then, through the proposal of an\nalternative naturalism, one that treats reason as a \u2018second\nnature,\u2019 or, a process of the realization of potentials.\nMcDowell draws on notions of tradition and formation\n(Bildung) in order to clarify this second nature. He writes,\n\u201chuman beings are intelligibly initiated into this stretch of\nthe space of reasons by ethical upbringing, which instills the\nappropriate shape to their lives. The resulting habits of thought and\naction are second nature\u201d (McDowell 1994, 84).\n\nIt is an open question how consistent Rorty\u2019s, McDowell\u2019s\nand Brandom\u2019s reactions to hermeneutics are with views developed\nwithin the historical movement of\n hermeneutics.[12]\n Still, Rorty\u2019s and McDowell\u2019s respective critical stances\ntoward modern epistemology and science, their novel uses of the\nconcept of formation (Bildung), as well as Rorty\u2019s\nnovel use of the concept of conversation, place them in a productive\nexchange with continental philosophical scholars on themes more\ncustomarily associated with nineteenth- and twentieth-century German\nphilosophy generally as well as with the historical movement of\nhermeneutics. Moreover, Rorty\u2019s turn to edification and the\ndiscovery of novel possibilities it affords as an alternative to the\npursuit of truth places him in proximity to postmodern hermeneutics,\nin\n particular.[13]\n",
