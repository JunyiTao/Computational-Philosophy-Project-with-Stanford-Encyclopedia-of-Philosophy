    "main_text": "Divine Foreknowledge and Human Freedom\n7. Divine Foreknowledge and Human Freedom\nOn Free Decision is one of Grosseteste\u2019s most influential\nand substantial philosophical works. Its first half is largely devoted\nto the problem of reconciling God\u2019s knowledge of the future with human\nfreedom. Much of the importance of this discussion resides in the\ntheory of modality that Grosseteste develops, but it is also of\nimportance for the argument Grosseteste presents for the\nincompatibility of God\u2019s knowledge of the future and future\ncontingency. Grosseteste correctly takes himself to be presenting a\ndifferent argument, and different solution, from those found in\nBoethius and Anselm, who had written two of the most important earlier\ndiscussions of the issue.  \n Grosseteste presents this argument as follows: \u201cEverything known\nby God is or was or will be; a is known by God (let a be a future\ncontingent); so a is or was or will be. But a neither is nor\nwas; so it will be. Each of the premises is clearly\nnecessary, as is the inference. So the conclusion is not just true but also\nnecessary, for only what is necessary follows from things that are necessary\u201d (Lewis 2017, 111).  The argument is in two parts: A sound argument without modal premises is presented for the conclusion that an event will\noccur. It is then claimed that its premises are necessary, and thus,\nby the principle that entailment transmits necessity from premises to\nconclusion, that its conclusion is necessary too. In his discussion of\nthis argument Grosseteste focuses on premises formulated in terms of\nGod\u2019s knowledge, but he clearly thinks that a range of arguments\nhaving the same form can be constructed, employing in their initial\npart not only premises about God\u2019s knowledge, but also premises\nformulated in terms of prophecy or even just past-tensed truths of the\nform \u201cIt was the case that A will exist.\u201d  \n Grosseteste\u2019s appeal to the principle that entailment transmits\nnecessity from the premises to the conclusions of a valid inference is\na striking feature of the kind of argument he considers.  This\nprinciple forms the focus of much of Grosseteste\u2019s discussion of the\nargument: \u201cIt would seem,\u201d he notes, \u201cthat the only reply that we can give to the [arguments] stated above \u2026 is to say that what is contingent does indeed follow from things that are necessary\u201d (Lewis 2017,\n129).  But in the final analysis Grossetete does not reject the\nprinciple; he holds that entailment does indeed transmit necessity\nfrom premises to conclusion: \u201cBy syllogistic inference, then, what is necessary follows from necessary antecedents with the kind of necessity possessed by the antecedents, and the conclusion, like the antecedents, has truth that cannot cease in the future and from which it cannot be altered.\u201d (Lewis 2017, 139).\n Grosseteste\u2019s response to such arguments is to grant that they in\nfact are sound and do indeed prove the necessity of true propositions\nabout future acts.  But he challenges the further conclusion drawn\nfrom them that if a proposition about a future act is necessary in the\nsense proved by such arguments, the act cannot really be a free\nact. Instead, Grosseteste takes the kind of necessity involved in such\narguments to be compatible with freedom. His strategy is to hold that\nthe freedom of future acts is incompatible only with a different kind\nof necessity, and that such arguments fail when formulated in terms of\nthis conception of necessity, since their premises and conclusions are\ncontingent in the correlative sense of contingency.\n Grosseteste\u2019s response to the conflict between divine\nforeknowledge and free decision and related arguments therefore has\ntwo parts: first, the claim that there is a distinct family of modal\nnotions in respect of which future events and true propositions about\nthem may be contingent; second, the claim that freedom requires only\nthis kind of contingency.  Unfortunately Grosseteste has little to say\nin support of this second claim, but his introduction of a distinct\nfamily of modal notions is of philosophical interest in its own right,\nas it marks an important stage in the development of modal theory.\n",
