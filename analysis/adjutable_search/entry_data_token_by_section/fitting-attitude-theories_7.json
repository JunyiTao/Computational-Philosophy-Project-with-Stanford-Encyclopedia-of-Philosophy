    "main_text": "Attractions || Value \u201cDemystified\u201d\n2.2 Value \u201cDemystified\u201d\n\nA second attraction often claimed for FA theory is its potential to\n\u201cdemystify\u201d value in various ways. Rabinowicz and\nR\u00f8nnow-Rasmussen (2004) suggest, for example, that FA\ntheory \u201cremoves the air of mystery from the normative\n\u2018compellingness\u2019 of values\u201d (391). Their thought is\nthat it\u2019s no mystery why facts about the value of things should\nhave normative implications for our responses to those things if such\nfacts are always grounded in, and so imply, normative facts about our\nresponses. But there are other ways in which FA theories have been\nclaimed to demystify value and, in particular, value\nsimpliciter.\n\nPerhaps the most important way in which FA theory stands to demystify\nvalue is by answering skepticism about it. In an influential paper,\nPeter Geach (1965) argues that there\u2019s no such thing as being\ngood or valuable simpliciter. In particular, he argues that\nthe only intelligible kind of \u201cgoodness\u201d there is, is\n\u201cattributive goodness\u201d, i.e., the kind of goodness that a\nthing has when it\u2019s good as the kind of thing that it is. Thus,\nfor Geach, while it makes sense to claim that things can be good\nas the kind of thing they are\u2014e.g., that there can be\ngood toasters, baristas, and bombs\u2014there\u2019s no sense to be\nmade of claims to the effect that something is just plain\ngood, i.e., valuable in a way that isn\u2019t relativized to a\nparticular kind of thing. Citing Geach, Philippa Foot (1985) and\nJudith Jarvis Thomson (1993, 1997) also marshal versions of this idea\nagainst traditional forms of consequentialism, which, on a natural\ncharacterization, aim to explain the rightness and wrongness of acts\nultimately in terms of facts about the (comparative) value\nsimpliciter of their outcomes. Although Foot and Thomson\ndisagree with Geach that all value is attributive\n(acknowledging the existence of a distinct property of being good\nfor, for instance), they at least agree that there\u2019s no\nsuch thing as being just plain good, or valuable simpliciter.\nThis conclusion is independently interesting, but, if true, would also\nhave devastating implications for traditional forms of\nconsequentialism (not to mention for primitivism about value\nsimpliciter of the kind discussed in sections 1.2 and\n2.1).\n\nAs several authors have noted, however, FA theories seem to offer a\npromising response to this kind of skepticism (Zimmerman 2001; Nye,\nPlunkett, and Ku 2015; Rowland 2016; McHugh and Way 2016). In\nparticular, FA theorists might hold that facts about value\nsimpliciter can be explained\u00a0fully\u00a0in terms of\ncertain kinds of normative facts about certain kinds of valuing\nresponses. Since skeptics about value simpliciter\naren\u2019t similarly skeptical about the kinds of normative facts\nthat FA theorists might appeal to in explaining this property, the FA\ntheorist\u2019s account of value simpliciter would thus seem\nto render the property intelligible, even by the skeptic\u2019s own\nlights. In this way, FA theorists can answer skeptics about value\nsimpliciter.\n\nAnd skepticism about value simpliciter isn\u2019t the only\nkind of value skepticism that FA theories stand to answer. In the last\nseveral decades, a version of consequentialism known as\n\u201cagent-relative\u201d consequentialism has come to prominence,\npromising to account for a range of normative phenomena often held to\nbe incompatible with traditional formulations of the view, e.g.,\nspecial obligations and deontic constraints (Dreier 1993; Portmore\n2005; Smith 2003). This kind of consequentialism can be developed in\neither of two ways. On the first way, agent-relative consequentialism\nposits a distinctive evaluative relation, viz., that of being valuable\nrelative to an agent, where this \u2018agent-relative\nvalue\u2019 is distinct both from value simpliciter, which\nis typically held to be agent neutral, and from the relation of being\nvaluable for the agent (see esp. Portmore 2005). According to\nsome, this relation can be glossed as value from the agent\u2019s\n\u201cpoint of view\u201d, where what\u2019s valuable from an\nagent\u2019s point of view\u00a0is meant to be distinct somehow, at\nleast in principle, from what the agent believes, or should believe,\nto be valuable (see, e.g., Hurka 2003). Agent-relative\nconsequentialists who posit this distinctive relation thus claim that\nwhich outcomes are best relative to an agent might differ\nfrom the outcomes that are either best simpliciter or best\nfor the agent. And, at least sometimes, what an agent ought to do on\nthis view is what would produce the outcome that\u2019s best relative\nto them. Paired with the right substantive assumptions about how to\nrank outcomes relative to particular agents, this apparatus purports\nto allow agent-relative consequentialists to capture the normative\nphenomena noted above. The second way of developing the view works\nsimilarly except that, rather than positing a distinctive notion of\nagent-relative value, on top of value simpliciter and the\nrelation of being valuable for, this variant of the view claims that,\nin fact, there\u2019s just a single kind of value, whose\nnature is fundamentally agent-relative, and which agents ought always\nto maximize (Smith 2009).\n\nHowever, in an influential paper, Mark Schroeder (2007b) questions the\nintelligibility of the kind of agent-relative value to which these\nversions of consequentialism appeal. And many others have also\nclaimed, similarly, that they lack any independent, pre-theoretical\ngrip on the notion of agent-relative value (Dancy 2000; Hurley 2017;\nMaguire 2016; Zimmerman 2011). In response, agent-relative\nconsequentialists (of both kinds) have turned to FA theory, claiming\nthat the relevant evaluative relation can be rendered intelligible by\nexplicating it in terms of certain normative properties of preference\nor desire (see esp. Portmore 2011 and Smith 2009). For example, the\nagent-relative consequentialist might claim that the agent-relative\nvalue of an outcome can be explicated in terms of agent-relative\nreasons for preferring it to its alternatives. They might then claim\nthat what agents ought to do is to bring about the outcomes they ought\nto prefer, all things considered, with the stipulation that\nagent-relative reasons for preference can be relevant to which\noutcomes agents ought to prefer. The details are important here, and\ncertain ways of developing this view seem less tenable than others\n(see, e.g., Schroeder 2007, 292\u201394). Still, FA theories do seem\nto offer agent-relative consequentialists the most promising line of\nresponse to their skeptical critics. (For more on this application of\nFA theory, see the entry on\n value theory).\n",
