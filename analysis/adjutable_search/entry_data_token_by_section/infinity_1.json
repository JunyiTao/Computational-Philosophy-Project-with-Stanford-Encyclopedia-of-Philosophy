Infinity in mathematics: a brief historical overview\n\nIn this section we will begin by showing how Greek mathematics\nstudiously avoided the use of infinity in the presentation of its\nresults by making use of the method of exhaustion (3.1). Then\nwe will look at the widespread use of infinitary objects and\nprocedures in 17th-century mathematics (theory of indivisibles and\npoints at infinity in geometry (3.2), infinitesimals in the calculus\n(3.3)) and Galileo\u2019s problem of extending counting to infinite\ncollections (3.4). By the early 18th-century mathematics had undergone\nits first \u201cinfinitistic revolution\u201d (the second is\nassociated with the name of Cantor, see section\n 3).\n Infinity had become a pressing foundational problem, and this will\nlead us to section\n 3.\n",
