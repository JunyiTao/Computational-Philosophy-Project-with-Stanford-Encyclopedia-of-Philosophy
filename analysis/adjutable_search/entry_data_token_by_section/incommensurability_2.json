He could not believe that someone as extraordinary as\nAristotle could have written them. Eventually patterns in the\ndisconcerting passages began to emerge, and then all at once, the text\nmade sense to him: a Gestalt switch that resulted when he changed the\nmeanings of some of the central terms. He saw this process of meaning\nchanging as a method of historical recovery. He realized that in his\nearlier encounters, he had been projecting contemporary meanings back\ninto his historical sources (Whiggish history), and that he would need\nto peel them away in order to remove the distortion and understand the\nAristotelian system in its own right (hermeneutic history). For\ninstance, when he encountered the word \u201cmotion\u201d in\nAristotle (the standard translation of the Greek kinesis), he\nwas thinking in terms of the change of position of objects in space\n(as we do today). But to get more closely at Aristotle\u2019s\noriginal usage, he had to expand the meaning of motion to cover a much\nbroader range of phenomena that include various other sorts of change,\nsuch as growth and diminution, alternation, and generation and\ncorruption, making an objects motion in space (displacement or\n\u2018locomotion\u2019) just a special case of motion. Kuhn realized\nthat these sorts of conceptual differences indicated breaks between\ndifferent modes of thought, and he suspected that such breaks must be\nsignificant both for the nature of knowledge, and for the sense in\nwhich the development of knowledge can be said to make progress.\nHaving made this discovery, Kuhn changed his career plans, leaving\ntheoretical physics to pursue this strange phenomenon. Some fifteen\nyears later the term \u2018incommensurable\u2019 first appears in\nhis classic The Structure of Scientific Revolutions\n(1962).\n2.2.2 Conceptual replacement and theory-ladenness of observation: Ludwik Fleck\n\nOf all the sources influencing Kuhn on incommensurability, at least\none deserves special attention. In the foreword of The Structure\nof Scientific Revolutions, Kuhn acknowledged a deep debt to\nLudwik Fleck, a bacteriologist who developed the first explicit\nsociology of natural science, and anticipated many contemporary views\nabout the social construction of knowledge. Around 1950, Kuhn was\nenticed by the potential relevance to his experience of\nincommensurability of Fleck\u2019s paradoxical title: Entstehung\nund Entwicklung einer wissenschaftlichen Tatsache: Einf\u00fchrung in\ndie Lehre von Denkstil und Denkkollektiv (1935)(Genesis and\nDevelopment of a Scientific Fact, 1979). There and in other\nearlier works, Fleck had already used \u2018inkommensurabel\u2019 to\ndescribe different styles of thinking within the natural sciences as\nwell as to discuss the ramifications of radical conceptual change in\nthe history of science. For example, Fleck used the term\n\u2018inkommensurabel\u2019 to describe the differences between\n\u2018medical thinking\u2019 and \u2018scientific thinking\u2019.\nThe former addresses irregular, temporally dynamic phenomena such as\nan illness, while the later addresses uniform phenomena (Fleck 1986\n[1927], 44\u201345). Fleck also used the term\n\u2018inkommensurabel\u2019 to describe conceptual replacements in\ntheoretical transitions within what he considered the most vital of\nthe natural sciences, the medical sciences. For example, he claimed\nthat an old concept of disease became incommensurable with a newer\nconcept that was not a completely adequate substitute for it (Fleck\n1979 [1935], 62). While Fleck\u2019s program of comparative\nepistemology anticipates Kuhn\u2019s ideas in many significant\nrespects, it is also strikingly different (Harwood 1986; Oberheim\n2005; Peine 2011). The most pervasive differences concerning\nincommensurability are that Fleck treats meaning and meaning change as\na function of how concepts are received and developed by the\ncollective, while for Kuhn it is individuals who develop and apply the\nconcepts that advance science. Moreover, for Fleck meaning change is a\ncontinuous feature of scientific development, whereas Kuhn\ndistinguishes normal scientific development that does not change\nmeanings from revolutionary developments that do.\n\nEven so, Fleck emphasized all three of the interrelated aspects of the\nshifts that Kuhn called revolutions and tried to capture by calling\ntheories \u2018incommensurable\u2019 (changes in problems and\nstandards (1979 [1935], 75\u201376; 1979 [1936], 89), conceptual\nchange (e.g. 1979 [1935]; 1979 [1936], 72, 83) and world change (e.g.\n1986 [1936], 112). Fleck argued that science does not approach the\ntruth because successive thought-styles raise new problems and discard\nolder forms of knowledge (Fleck 1986 [1936], 111\u2013112; 1979\n[1935], 19, 51, 137\u2013139; cf. Harwood 1986, 177). Fleck\nemphasized that scientific terms acquire their meanings through their\napplication within a particular theoretical context and that those\nmeanings change when theories change in the course of advance, even\noffering the example of \u2018chemical elements\u2019 and\n\u2018compounds\u2019 repeated by Kuhn (Fleck 1979 [1935], 25, 39,\n40, 53\u201354). Fleck emphasized the theory-ladenness of observation\nwith explicit reference to Gestalt switches; stressing that a\n\u2018thought-style\u2019 determines not only the meanings of the\nconcepts it uses, but also the perception of phenomena to be\nexplained, developing examples from the history of anatomical\nrepresentation (1979 [1935], 66; 1986 [1947]). Fleck (like Kuhn,\nFeyerabend and Wittgenstein) acknowledged Wolfgang K\u00f6hler\u2019s\nwork in psychology of perception in this regard. Fleck concluded that\nscientific advance is not cumulative, that conceptual differences\nbetween members of different scientific communities cause\ncommunication difficulties between them (1979 [1936], 109), and later\nfor historians trying to understand older ideas (1979 [1936],\n83\u201385, 89). Fleck even emphasized that meaning change in the\ncourse of scientific advance causes translation failure between\ntheories, anticipating a central aspect of Kuhn\u2019s later notion\nof taxonomic incommensurability (e.g. 1986 [1936], 83).\n2.2.3 Gestalt psychology and organized perception\n\nAnother major source of Kuhn\u2019s idea of the incommensurability of\nscientific theories is Gestalt psychology (Kuhn 1962, vi). Wolfgang\nK\u00f6hler, for example, had emphasized the active role of\norganization in perception and argued that in psychology one begins\nwith Gestalten (organized, segregated wholes such as the\nobjects of human perception or identifiable human behaviours) and then\nproceeds to discover their natural parts (and not vice versa, like in\nparticle physics). In the opening sentences of the condensed English\nversion of K\u00f6hler\u2019s investigation of the relationship\nbetween the mental concepts of psychology and the material concepts of\nphysics, K\u00f6hler wrote: \u201cIn order to orient itself in the\ncompany of natural sciences, psychology must discover connections\nwherever it can between its own phenomena and those of other\ndisciplines. If this search fails, then psychology must recognize that\nits categories and those of natural science are incommensurable\u201d\n(1938 [1920], 17).\n2.2.4 The image of art and the image of science\n\nIn a preliminary draft \u201cThe Structure of Scientific Revolutions,\nChapter 1, What are Scientific Revolutions?\u201d (dated 1958-1960,\nlikely composed in late 1958) of the first chapter of his projected\nbook, Kuhn initially used the idea of incommensurability to\ncharacterize stages of development in the arts in contrast to the\ntraditional image of scientific progress as cumulative that he set out\nto challenge (see Pinto de Oliveira, 2017). Although, this draft\nchapter was entirely rewritten as the introduction of Kuhn (1962), and\nwas explicitly intended only to provoke exploratory discussion and not\nfor publication, it strongly suggests that, at that time, Kuhn began\nto develop the idea of the incommensurability in science in reaction\nto the traditional (e.g. Sarton, Conant) contrast between development\nin the arts and cumulative progress in the sciences (see Pinto de\nOliveira, 2017). In the draft, Kuhn announced his project as an\nattempt to reshape the image of science so as to make it closer to the\nimage of art (see Pinto de Oliveira, 2017). He wanted to challenge the\ncumulative conception of scientific progress promoted by the old\nhistoriography of science, according to which \u201cscience appears\nto advance by accretion\u201d and science is \u201can ever-growing\nedifice to which each scientist strives to add a few stones or a bit\nof mortar\u201d (Kuhn 1958, 2, as cited in Pinto de Oliveira 2017,\n748) in contrast to the image of art according to which \u201cthe\ntransition between one stage of artistic development and the next is a\ntransition between incommensurables\u201d (Kuhn 1958, 3, as cited in\nPinto de Oliveira 2017, 749).\n\nA few pages later, Kuhn proceeds to apply the idea of\nincommensurability to science for the very first time, again while\ncomparing scientific revolutions to the non-cumulative nature of\nprogress in the arts: \u201cOften a decision to embrace a new theory\nturns out to involve an implicit redefinition of the corresponding\nscience. Old problems may be relegated to another science or may be\ndeclared entirely \u2018unscientific\u2019. Problems that, on the old\ntheory, were non-existent or trivial may, with a new theory, become\nthe very archetypes of significant scientific achievement. And, as the\nproblems change, so, often, does the standard that distinguishes a\nreal scientific solution from a mere metaphysical speculation, word\ngame, or mathematical play. It follows that, to a significant extent,\nthe science that emerges from a scientific revolution is not only\nincompatible, but often actually incommensurable, with that which has\ngone before. Only as this is realized, can we grasp the full sense in\nwhich scientific revolutions are like those in the arts\u201d (Kuhn\n1958, 17\u201318 as cited in Pinto de Oliveira 2017, 756). Kuhn\nconcludes that \u201cIf we are to preserve any part of the metaphor\nwhich makes inventions and discoveries new bricks for the scientific\nedifice, and if we are simultaneously to give resistance and\ncontroversy an essential place in the development of science, then we\nmay have to recognize that the addition of new bricks demands at least\npartial demolition of the existing structure, and that the new edifice\nerected to include the new brick is not just the old one plus, but a\nnew building. We may, that is, be forced to recognize that new\ndiscoveries and new theories do not simply add to the stock of\npre-existing scientific knowledge. They change it.\u201d (Kuhn 1958,\n7, as cited in Pinto de Oliveira 2017, 756).\n",
