    "main_text": "Human Nature and the Person\n4. Human Nature and the Person\n\nModern Confucianism has been strongly influenced by Western\nphilosophy. It is therefore not surprising that many modern Confucian\nphilosophical problems can fit tidily in the typical Western\nphilosophy categories. Their concept of the person, however, does not.\nTheir discourses on the person range across metaphysics, philosophy of\nmind, epistemology, and metaethics. The previous section demonstrated\nhow their views on knowledge center around defending knowledge of\nvalue. Here we get deeper into questions of what defines human beings,\nwhat reason means, the source of value, how we know ethical action is\npossible, and more.\n\nBefore looking at the modern Confucians themselves, a few words about\nwhy this issue is so central would be useful. The question of human\nnature has a long history in Chinese philosophy, and as self-conscious\ninheritors of this tradition, modern Confucians wanted to relate their\nviews to major figures of the past, especially the classical thinkers\nKongzi (Confucius) and Mengzi (Mencius), and the Ming Confucian Wang\nYangming. They demoted Zhu Xi, the most influential Song Confucian,\nand had no tolerance for the evidential learning scholarship of the\nQing period. The true Confucian tradition (in their minds) follows\nMengzi in affirming that human nature is good, and Wang Yangming in\nasserting that moral values and motivation must be uncovered in\noneself, not in phenomena. This wing of the Confucian tradition\nasserted that people have not just a potential but tendency toward\nmoral action, and this tendency is definitive of being human. Anyone\ncan become a sage, the paragon of moral excellence. It is what being\nfully human means. This is how these Confucians answer the questions\nof why and how to be moral: it is what is natural for us, and we have\nthe knowledge and motivations in the mind already.\n\nIn the modern period, Confucians had two main concerns. One was the\nexplicit attacks on Chinese culture as well as the general upheaval\nand sense of value instability brought about by the events of the\ntime. What had been a reasonably stable (if inequitable) political and\nsocial structure had collapsed without a clear replacement. Many\npeople were fascinated by novelty and turned away from traditional\nvalues. The other, not unrelated, concern was the reductionism and\nlack of true moral value that they found in Western culture. Xiong\nShili never left China, but Mou, Tang, and Xu all spent time in Hong\nKong and traveled to Europe and the US as well. They were not pleased\nwith what they found. Utilitarianism and related reductionist\napproaches that did not distinguish moral value from happiness, desire\nsatisfaction, survival, or any other non-moral value were entirely\nunacceptable to them. Tang Junyi wrote,\n\n\nThe most important point for our affirming the value of a kind of\ncultural activity is that it directly reveals the value of the human\nspirit itself, and not its instrumental or utilitarian value\u2026.\nWe must strictly adhere to the standpoint of the Chinese cultural\ntradition which emphasizes the distinction between human beings and\nanimals and between right and utility, and apply this in cultural\nchoices. Therefore, for decades we have needed to eliminate by their\nroots utilitarianism, materialism, and any form of naturalism that\ndoes not distinguish between human beings and animals. (TJCW 9:\n328)\n\n\nThese naturalistic approaches are not only philosophically misguided,\nbut extremely harmful to moral practice as well.\n",
