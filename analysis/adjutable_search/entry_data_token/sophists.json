As sophia could designate specific types of\nexpertise as well as general sagacity in the conduct of life and the\nhigher kinds of insight associated with seers and poets, the word\noriginally meant \u2018sage\u2019 or \u2018expert\u2019. In the\ncourse of the fifth century BCE the term, while retaining its original\nunspecific sense, came in addition to be applied specifically to a new\ntype of intellectuals, professional educators who toured the Greek\nworld offering instruction in a wide range of subjects, with particular\nemphasis on skill in public speaking and the successful conduct of\nlife. The emergence of this new profession, which was an extension to\nnew areas of the tradition of the itinerant rhapsode (reciter of poems,\nespecially of Homer), was a response to various social, economic,\npolitical and cultural developments of the period. The increasing\nwealth and intellectual sophistication of Greek cities, especially\nAthens, created a demand for higher education beyond the traditional\nbasic grounding in literacy, arithmetic, music and physical training.\nTo some extent this involved the popularization of Ionian speculation\nabout the physical world (see Presocratic Philosophy), which was\nextended into areas such as history, geography and the origins of\ncivilization. The increase in participatory democracy, especially in\nAthens, led to a demand for success in political and forensic oratory,\nand hence to the development of specialized techniques of persuasion\nand argument. Finally, the period saw the flourishing of a challenging,\nrationalistic climate of thought on questions including those of\nmorality, religion and political conduct, to which the sophists both\nresponded and contributed. It is important to emphasize the\nindividualistic character of the sophistic profession; its\npractitioners belonged to no organization, shared no common body of\nbeliefs and founded no schools, either in the sense of academic\ninstitutions or in that of bodies of individuals committed to the\npromulgation of specific doctrines. In what follows we shall illustrate\nthe diversity of sophistic activities, while considering the extent to\nwhich we can nevertheless identify common themes and attitudes.\n", "toc": [{"#Pro": "1.

Protagoras\n\n\nA key figure in the emergence of this new type of sophist was Protagoras of Abdera, a subject\ncity of the Athenian empire on the north coast of the Aegean. Abdera was\nalso the birthplace of Democritus, whom some later sources represented\nas the teacher of Protagoras. In all probability Democritus was the\nyounger of the two by about thirty years, and the only solid evidence\nof intellectual relations between them is a statement by Plutarch\n(Against Colotes. 1108F) that Democritus argued against Protagorean\nsubjectivism (see below), complemented by Sextus, who reports\n(Against the Mathematicians VII.389\u201390) that Democritus\u2019 arguments included the\nargument that Protagoras\u2019 subjectivism is self-refuting.\nProtagoras was one of the earliest sophists; as presented in\nPlato\u2019s Protagoras (one of our principal sources for\nProtagoras\u2019 life and activities as a teacher) he says (317c) that\nhe is old enough to be the father of anyone present, who included rival\nsophists Hippias and Prodicus, while another Plato passage\n(Meno 91e) says that he practised as a sophist for over forty\nyears till his death at about seventy (probably about 420 BC). In the\nProtagoras he also says (316d\u2013317b) that while the activity of\nsophistry has been practised by poets and other experts from ancient\ntimes, he is the first person to have openly proclaimed himself a\n\u201csophist\u201d and claimed to teach people (sc. how to achieve\nsuccess in life); he thus claims for himself recognition of his\nprofessional status in a role, that of teacher of human excellence as a\nmeans to success in life, which was traditionally claimed by the\npoets\n\n\nSpecifically, in the Protagoras he claims to teach\n\u2018the proper management of one\u2019s own affairs, how best to\nrun one\u2019s household, and the management of public affairs, how to\nmake the most effective contribution to the affairs of the city by word\nand action\u2019, and he accepts Socrates\u2019 account of that\nsubject as \u2018the art of running a city\u2019, which he promises\nwill \u2018make men into good citizens\u2019 (319a). Can we form any\nconception of the means by which this ambitious project of education in\nself-improvement and good citizenship was to be put into effect? In his\n\u2018Great Speech\u2019 in the dialogue (320c\u2013328d) Protagoras\npresents an account of the development of human civilization, with the\naim of showing that the essence of good citizenship consists in justice\nand self-restraint, which are natural to humans in that the\npreservation of the social order, and ultimately the survival of the\nspecies, depend on their being universally inculcated. It is at least\nplausible that this complex of themes, including the development of\ncivilization from primitive beginnings, the nature of social virtue and\nits foundation in human nature, represents some of the content of\nProtagoras\u2019 actual teaching; the list of titles of his works\npreserved by Diogenes Laertius (IX.55) includes \u2018On the\nVirtues\u2019, \u2018On (the) Constitution\u2019 (Peri\nPoliteias) and \u2018On the State of Things in the\nBeginning\u2019. Later in the dialogue he provides a critical reading\nof a poem of Simonides, saying that the ability to specify the good and\nbad parts of a poem and to justify one\u2019s criticisms is a very\nimportant part of education (338e\u2013339a). Relevantly to this, he is\nreported as a pioneer of some aspects of linguistic theory, and of its\napplication to literary criticism. He wrote on correctness in language\n(orthoepeia, Plato, Phaedrus 267c): he is said to\nhave devised a taxonomy of speech acts into assertion, question,\nanswer, command etc. (Diogenes Laertius IX.53\u20134), and to have criticised the opening\nof the Iliad \u2018Sing, goddess, of the wrath of\nAchilles\u2019 on the ground that instead of a prayer, as it ought to\nbe, the phrase is a command (Aristotle Poetics 1456b15\u201316). He is\nalso said both to have classified grammatical genders (Aristotle\nRhetoric 1407b6\u20137) and to have suggested that gender should be\nmodified to fit the sense, so that \u2018wrath\u2019\n(m\u0113nis) in the same line of Homer, which is a\ngrammatical feminine, should be masculine, since wrath is\ncharacteristic of males rather than females (Aristotle Sophistici\nElenchi 173b19\u201320). It is unclear whether these topics and their\napplication to literary criticism are seen primarily as part of an\nindividual\u2019s cultural refinement, something valuable for its own\nsake, or whether the aim is to be able to incorporate exegesis and\ncriticism of poets in forensic or political speeches, as one tactic in\nargument and persuasion.\n\n\nIn any event, we do have some evidence for Protagoras\u2019\nteaching of techniques of argument. Diogenes Laertius\u2019 list of\ntitles includes one, \u2018The Technique of Eristics\u2019\n(Techn\u0113 Eristik\u014dn) which certainly\ndesignates a handbook of argumentative techniques, and another which\nprobably does. The literal title is \u2018On Wrestling\u2019, but it\nis more likely that the wrestling in question is intellectual than\nphysical; there is nothing in our other evidence to suggest that\nProtagoras set himself up as an athletic coach. (It is relevant that\nProtagoras\u2019 celebrated work \u2018Truth\u2019, which began with\nthe famous \u2018Man the Measure\u2019 sentence (see below)\napparently had the alternative title \u2018Overthrowing\u2019 (sc.\nArguments) (Kataballontes).) So Protagoras taught\nargumentative strategies, but we have comparatively little evidence of\nwhat these actually were. The critique of Simonides\u2019 poem\nmentioned above suggests that eliciting a contradiction from\none\u2019s opponent\u2019s statements was one such strategy, since\nwhat Protagoras actually does is to seek to show that Simonides\ncontradicts himself in first asserting that it is hard to become good\nand then in finding fault with Pittacus, one of the so-called\n\u2018Seven Sages\u2019, for saying that it hard to be good.\nSocrates\u2019 description of the audience\u2019s loud applause\n(339d10\u2013e1) is one of the many indications that sophistic argumentative\ncontests had the status of a spectator sport, even to the extent of\nfiguring among the sideshows at the great athletic festivals; in\nPlato\u2019s Lesser Hippias (363c\u2013364a) Hippias\ndescribes how he goes regularly to the Olympic Games to take part in\ncontests of question and answer and has never yet been beaten, and\nsimilarly Protagoras says that he has had verbal contests with many\npeople, and that he would never have become celebrated if he had\nallowed his opponents to dictate the rules of the contest\n(Prot. 335a). According to Diogenes Laertius IX.52 Protagoras\nwas the first to institute such contests. The technique of adversarial\nargument clearly has some connection with two specific claims for which\nProtagoras was famous (or notorious). According to Diogenes Laertius he\nwas the first to maintain that on any matter there are two theses,\nstatements (or perhaps arguments) (logoi) opposed to one\nanother (IX.51 (=DK 80B6a)), and according to Aristotle he claimed\n\u2018to make the weaker (or inferior) logos stronger (or\nsuperior) (ton h\u0113tt\u014d logon\nkreitt\u014d poiein)\u2019 (Rhetoric 1402a23\u20135 (=DK\n80B6b)), for which claim he was, Aristotle says (ibid.), rightly\ncensured. Investigation of what Protagoras may have meant by these\nclaims leads to consideration of his views on truth and reality, and\nspecifically to the \u2018Man the Measure\u2019 doctrine and the\nissue of relativism.\n\n\nWhile relativism, particularly in the area of morality, is popularly\nseen as characteristic of sophists generally (see Bett 1989), in fact\nProtagoras is the only sophist to whom ancient sources ascribe\nrelativistic views, and even in his case the evidence is ambiguous. A\nkey text is the famous \u2018Man the Measure\u2019 sentence, the\nopening sentence of his work entitled \u2018Truth\u2019, which runs\n\u2018Man is the measure of all things, of the things that are that\nthey are and of the things that are not that they are not\u2019\n(Plato, Theaetetus 151e, Sextus Against the Mathematicians VII.60 (=DK 80B1)). In\nthe Theaetetus (our principal source for this aspect of\nProtagoras\u2019 teaching) this is interpreted as a claim of the\nrelativity of the truth of all judgments to the experience or belief of\nthe individual making the judgment, i.e., as subjectivism. On that\ninterpretation, the way things seem to an individual is the way they\nare in fact for that individual. First illustrated by Socrates, who\nquotes this sentence, as a claim concerning sensory appearances, e.g.,\nthat if the wind feels cold to me and warm to you then it is cold for\nme and warm for you, in the course of the dialogue Socrates expands it\nto apply to all judgments, including itself, yielding the result that\nevery belief is true for the person who holds it (and only for them),\nand hence that there is no objective truth on any matter. That this\nsubjectivist interpretation was current in antiquity is shown by\nAristotle\u2019s attribution to Protagoras of the view that \u2018it\nis equally possible to affirm and to deny anything of anything\u2019\n(Metaphysics 1007b20\u201322) and by Sextus\u2019 evidence of\nDemocritus\u2019 critique of Protagoras mentioned above; Sextus\nreports Democritus (and Plato, see Theaetetus 170e\u2013171c) as having\nargued that, given Protagoras\u2019 thesis that every appearance\n(phantasia) is true, the thesis that it is not the case that\nevery appearance is true, \u2018which is itself in accordance with\nappearance (kata phantasian huphistamenon)\u2019 is\ntrue; hence Protagoras\u2019 thesis is self-refuting. But elsewhere in\nthe Theaetetus (167c) Socrates explains Protagoras\u2019 view\nby claiming on his behalf that \u2018whatever things seem to each city\nto be fine and just are so for that city, so long as it maintains them\n(he\u014ds an auta\nnomiz\u0113i)\u2019: i.e., the truth about what\nis fine and just (which appears to indicate the truth of moral\njudgments generally) is relative not to the judgment of the individual,\nbut to that of the society to which the individual belongs. If the wind\nfeels cold to me, and I consequently believe that it is cold, there is\nno objective fact of the matter by reference to which that belief can\nbe false; but if I believe that infanticide is wrong, whereas\ninfanticide is sanctioned by the laws and customs of the state of which\nI am a citizen, then my belief is straightforwardly false, though of\ncourse it would come to be true if the state of which I am a citizen\nchanged its laws and customs so as to condemn infanticide. Within a\nsingle Platonic dialogue, then, Protagoras is represented as\nmaintaining both universal subjectivism and limited social relativism,\nthough those two versions of relativism are mutually inconsistent. And\nthere is a further twist. In the very passage of the\nTheaetetus where, according to Socrates, Protagoras maintains\nthe social relativity of moral judgments (167b\u2013c), he gives a pragmatic\njustification of the role of the expert, both in the individual and in\nthe social context. In the individual case, while no appearance is\ntruer than any other, some appearances are better than others, and it\nis the role of the expert (for instance, the doctor) to produce better\nappearances instead of worse (as those appearances are then judged even\nby the patient); while in the case of cities, some judgments of what is\njust etc. are better than others, and it is the role of the expert (in\nthis case the expert orator) to persuade the city to adopt the better\njudgment. (He adds (167c7\u2013d1) that the sophist improves those whom he\neducates in the same way, implying that not merely collective judgments\nbut also individual judgments (about what?) may be better or worse.)\nThis account of the role of the expert may imply that there are matters\nof fact of what is better and worse independent of the judgement of\nthose whom the expert persuades. E.g., a city might initially judge it\nright to pursue its individual interest without any consideration of\nobligations to other cities, but then be persuaded that it was more in\nits long-term interest to respect treaties. That persuasion presupposes\nthat the question of what is in the city\u2019s long-term interest is\na matter of fact, not merely a matter of how it now seems to the\ncity.\n\n\nThe evidence of the Theaetetus on Protagorean relativism is\ntherefore ambiguous, since in that dialogue he is represented as\nmaintaining a) universal subjectivism, b) social relativism in morality\nand c) objective realism on questions of advantage. The evidence of\nAristotle and Democritus (transmitted by Sextus) indicates that he did\nin fact maintain a), but leaves it open whether the attribution to him\nof b) and c) is historically accurate, thereby indicating inconsistency\non his part, or is due to misinterpretation, deliberate or inadvertent,\non the part of Plato. It should also be recognized that in the\nTheaetetus Socrates only attributes b) and c) to Protagoras in\nhis overarching effort, on Theaetetus\u2019 behalf, to explicate and\ndefend as plausibly as possible the \u2018Man the measure\u2019\ndoctrine before refuting it. The portrayal in the Protagoras\nshows little trace of relativism, either individual or social; instead\nhe maintains that the essential social virtues are justice and\nself-restraint, and that without universal inculcation of those virtues\nthe survival of society is impossible. These claims are presented as\nuniversal truths; there is not the slightest suggestion that in making\nthem Protagoras is merely expressing a preference for these virtues\nwhich happens to prevail, e.g., in Athens, but which might be absent from\nthe mores of some other city. It is clearly implied by his exposition\nthat no such city could exist. On the assumption, adopted above, that\nthe presentation of Protagoras\u2019 social teaching in the dialogue\nis in essentials intended to be historically accurate, we must conclude\nthat Protagoras recognised certain objective truths, not merely on\nquestions of advantage, but in some fundamentals of morality, and\nconsequently that his basic position was inconsistent.\n\n\nYet a further epistemological position is attributed to Protagoras in\na papyrus fragment of the biblical commentator Didymus the Blind\n(fourth century CE), published in 1968. In this he appears neither as\na subjectivist nor as a social relativist, but as a sceptic. In the\nfragment he is represented as saying \u2018To you who are present I\nappear to be sitting, but to someone who is not present I do not\nappear to be sitting. It is unclear whether I am sitting or\nnot\u2019. On this account there is an objective fact of the matter,\nwhich is undiscoverable because different individuals have different\nappearances of what is the case, whereas given subjectivism there is\nno fact of the matter over and above the individual appearances which\nestablish how each thing is for the one being appeared to. This might\nbe yet another inconsistency on the part of Protagoras, but if so it\nis one which has no confirmation from any other source. It is more\nlikely that what the fragment presents is a garbled instance of\nProtagorean subjectivism.  Instead of the genuinely Protagorean\nargument \u2018It seems to A that I am sitting and\nto B that I am not sitting, so I am sitting for A\nand I am not sitting for B\u2019 we have the argument given\nin the fragment. Since the subjectivist thesis is that every belief is\ntrue for the person who has it, from the premisses that A\nbelieves that I am sitting and B does not believe that I am\nsitting (because B has no belief one way or the other), the\ncorrect Protagorean conclusion is not that it is unclear whether I am\nsitting or not sitting, but that it is true for A that I am\nsitting and that it is neither true for B that I am sitting\nnor true for B that I am not sitting.\n\n\nAll of this leaves it unclear what we are to make of the assertion\nthat on every matter there are two logoi opposed to one\nanother, and the claim to make the weaker logos (the)\nstronger. The former cannot be understood as the assertion of universal\nsubjectivism, since it is in fact inconsistent with it. Given universal\nsubjectivism, the claim that the wind is cold for me is not opposed to\nthe claim that it is warm for you, since both are (relatively) true.\nNor, for the same reason, can it be understood as an assertion of\nsocial relativism: the assertion that for girls to exercise naked is\nshameful in Athens is not opposed to the claim that it is not shameful\nin Sparta. Perhaps we should not try to tie this claim tightly to any\ngeneral metaphysical position, but interpret it more loosely as the\nclaim that that on a great many matters there are two sides to the\nquestion. What this might involve is perhaps indicated by the so-called\nDissoi Logoi (i.e., Arguments on Either Side), a short\ntext found appended to some manuscripts of Sextus, generally dated to\nthe end of the fifth century. This text consists for the most part of a\nseries of short discussions of pairs of standardly opposed moral\nproperties, e.g., the good and the bad, the just and the unjust, the\nmost general pattern being a series of arguments to show on the one\nhand that the opposed properties are in fact identical, followed by a\nseries to show that on the other they are non-identical. Mostly the\narguments for identity depend on the relativity of the application of\nthe property, e.g., the bad is the same as the good because disease is\nbad for the patient but good for the doctor, while the arguments for\nnon-identity rely on the absence of relativity, e.g., doing what is good\nfor one\u2019s parents is not the same thing as doing what is bad for\none\u2019s parents. Plainly, there is no inconsistency between the\ntheses of identity and of non-identity, and it is not clear that the\nreader is supposed to be required to choose one rather than the other.\nPerhaps the point is simply to see that, given the appropriate\ndistinctions, there is something to be said either way, with the\nimplication that the correct answer to the question \u2018Is the good\nthe same as the bad, or different?\u2019 is \u2018In one way (i.e.,\nrelative to different things) the same, in another (i.e., relative to\nthe same thing) different\u2019 (see Protagoras 334a\u2013c.).\nThat could be a useful tactic to employ against an opponent who\ninsisted on a \u2018Yes or No\u2019 answer.\n\n\nSimilarly, the claim to make the weaker logos the stronger\nhas nothing to do with relativism, either individual or social. Since,\nas we have seen, relativized beliefs are not in conflict with one\nanother, arguments in favor of them are not in conflict either, and\nhence neither the beliefs themselves nor the arguments in favor of them\ncan be weaker or stronger than one another. Aristotle\u2019s evidence\nin the Rhetoric passage cited above indicates that the context\nof the claim is that of forensic oratory, and specifically that the\narguments in question are arguments from what is likely or plausible,\ne.g., on the one side that it is not likely that a weakling would\nassault a strong man, since he would expect to be beaten up himself\ninstead, and on the other side that it is not likely that a strong man\nwould assault a weakling, since everyone would assume precisely that it\nwas likely that he would do so, hence he would know that he would\nalmost certainly be found guilty, hence in those circumstances it is\nunlikely that he would actually commit the crime. In any case\nof this kind, where it is assumed that the facts cannot be established\nwith certainty, considerations of what is plausible may, given\nsufficient ingenuity, be adduced on either side, and similar arguments\ncan be adduced in the context of political deliberation, where the\nfuture outcome cannot be certain and the decision has to turn on the\nbalance of probabilities. It is likely, then, that this slogan was a\nsales pitch for Protagoras as a teacher of forensic and deliberative\nrhetoric. How ambitious the claim was is hard to determine. It is hard\nto believe that he ventured to claim always to make the prima facie\nweaker case carry the day (which is equivalent to the claim to make\nevery case whatever carry the day), but equally implausible that he\nmerely claimed to make the weaker case stronger than it was before he\ndevised arguments in its favor. Perhaps he simply claimed that he was\ncapable, in the appropriate circumstances, of devising arguments which\nwould turn the weaker case into the stronger one. If so, the claim was\nboth reasonable and, despite Aristotle\u2019s strictures, not\nnecessarily morally discreditable. E.g., the prosecution may have a\nstrong case that Leon committed a theft, since a number of\neye-witnesses identified him as the thief, but if the defence can show\nthat he has an identical twin brother, Pantaleon, who was in the\nvicinity, and further that Pantaleon is a known thief, whereas Leon has\nan unblemished record, the case that Leon is innocent, which was\npreviously the weaker, is now the stronger, and the defence is not\nnecessarily guilty of any sharp practice (even if Leon was in fact\nguilty of the crime). (Of course, a defence counsel who secured an\nacquittal on these grounds while knowing independently that Leon was\nguilty would deserve Aristotle\u2019s disapproval.)\n\n\nTo complete our account of Protagoras\u2019 views on language and\nreality we need to mention the thesis that it is impossible to say what\nis false, which occurs in three Platonic passages, Euthydemus\n284a\u2013c, Theaetetus 188d\u2013189a and Sophist 236e\u2013237e. According\nto this argument falsehood is impossible, since to say what is false is\nto say what is not (legein to m\u0113 on),\nwhereas anyone who speaks has to say something that is (on\nti); hence saying what is not is saying what is not anything, i.e.,\nnot saying anything. Hence, since of contradictory statements one must\nbe false, it is not possible to contradict (ouk estin\nantilegein  (Euthydemus 286b)). This argument has its origin\nin Parmenides\u2019 claim (DK 28B2) that \u2018You could not know\nwhat is not \u2026 nor could you say it\u2019, and its application\nto falsehood and the impossibility of contradiction is ascribed to\nvarious fifth-century figures, including \u2018Protagoras and his\nassociates and even earlier people\u2019 (hoi amphi\nPr\u014dtagoran \u2026 kai hoi eti palaioteroi\n(Euthydemus 286c2\u20133)), Prodicus (in another fragment of Didymus,\npublished in 1966), Cratylus (Cratylus 429d) and Antisthenes (Aristotle\nMetaphysics 1024b32\u20134). In the case of the latter two the\nthesis connects with other more general theses about language which\nthey are reported to have held. Thus Cratylus has attributed to him by\nPlato the thesis that each thing has its own proper name, which\nexpresses, through its etymology, the nature of the things it names,\nand which has significance only when correctly applied, but is\notherwise a mere empty sound. Hence there can no such thing as the\nmisapplication of a name (since a misapplied name is not a name, but a\nmere sound), and hence no such thing as a false statement, since (it is\nassumed) every false statement involves the misapplication of some\nname. Similarly Antisthenes held that each thing has its own proper\ndefinition or description, which cannot be applied to anything else,\nfrom which again the impossibility of falsehood follows. In the case of\nProtagoras it is hard to find any such connection. On the most\nplausible construal of subjectivism no one\u2019s belief can\ncontradict anyone else\u2019s belief, but that does not appear to rule\nout an individual\u2019s having inconsistent beliefs. Further,\nsubjectivism does not rule out false statements; I can falsely assert\n\u2018The wind is cold for me\u2019 when in fact it is not cold for\nme. Though Protagoras seems to have had a fairly high tolerance\nthreshold for inconsistency, it is hard to see how one and the same\nperson could assert both that it is impossible to contradict and that\non every matter there are two opposed logoi. The wording of\nthe attribution to Protagoras in the Euthydemus is\nsuspiciously vague, suggesting that Plato is attributing to Socrates a\nvague memory of Protagorean subjectivism, rather than precise recall of\nany particular doctrine.\n2. Nomos and Phusis\n\n\nProtagoras\u2019 account of social morality in the Great Speech,\naccording to which the universal acceptance of justice and\nself-restraint is necessary for the perpetuation of society, and\nthereby for the preservation of the human species, places Protagoras\nfirmly on one side (the conservative side, we should note) of the\ndebate about the relation between law and convention (nomos)\non the one hand and nature or reality (phusis) on the other,\nwhich was central to moral and social thought in the fifth and fourth\ncenturies. The debate was fundamentally about the status of moral and\nother social norms; were such norms ever in some sense part of or\ngrounded in the reality of things, or were they in every case mere\nproducts of human customs, conventions or beliefs? The question was\ncrucial to the perceived authority of norms; both sides agreed in\nseeing nature as authoritative for correct human behavior, and as the\nultimate source of true value. Critics of traditional morality argued\nthat since that morality was nothing more than a human invention it\nthereby lacked genuine authority (which belonged to the realm of\nnature), thus sanctioning violation of traditional moral norms if the\nviolator could escape punishment or other bad consequences (while\n\u2018following nature\u2019), while the upholders of morality sought\nto show that morality, as reflected in traditional norms, was itself in\nsome sense a part or product of nature. We find examples of the\ncritical stance both in some Platonic dialogues and in some sophistic\nwritings. The starkest expression of the opposition between\nnomos and phusis is that expressed in the\nGorgias by Callicles, a pupil of Gorgias (though there is no\nsuggestion in the dialogue or elsewhere that Gorgias himself held that\nposition): Callicles holds that conventional morality is a contrivance\ndevised by the weak and unintelligent to inhibit the strong and\nintelligent from doing what they are entitled by nature to do, viz.\nexploit their inferiors for their own advantage. He is thus an inverted\nmoralist, who holds that what it is really right to do is what it is\nconventionally wrong to do. The true, authoritative norms are those\nwhich prevail in nature, as shown by the behavior of non-human animals\nsuch as beasts of prey; those who act in accordance with these norms\n\u2018do these things in accordance with the nature of justice and\n\u2026 the law of nature, but perhaps not in accordance with this one\nwhich we lay down\u2019 (Plato, Gorgias, 483e). The sophist Thrasymachus maintains a\nsimilar position in Book I of the Republic, though without\nCallicles\u2019 daring inversion of values. He agrees with Callicles\nin praising the ruthless individual (above all the tyrant) who is\ncapable of overcoming the restraints of morality, but whereas Callicles\ncalls such self-assertion naturally just, Thrasymachus abides by\nconventional morality in calling it unjust. Both agree that a\nsuccessful life of ruthless self-assertion is supreme happiness, and\nthat that is what nature prompts us to seek; both, then, accept the\nnormative authority of nature over nomos. The difference\nbetween them is that Callicles takes the further step of identifying\nthe authority of nature with that of real, as opposed to conventional\nmorality, whereas for Thrasymachus there is only one kind of morality,\nconventional morality, which has no authority. In Book II Glaucon\npresents a modified version of Thrasymachus\u2019 position; while\nmaintaining, as Protagoras does in the Great Speech, that humans adopt\nmoral conventions as a necessary survival strategy in a hostile world,\nhe insists that this involves a stunting of human nature, since people\nare obliged for self-protection to abandon the goal of\nself-satisfaction to which nature, as Thrasymachus insists, prompts\nthem. This assertion of egoism is supported by the thought-experiment\nof Gyges\u2019 ring; if, like the legendary Gyges, we had a magic ring\nwhich rendered us invisible, and hence immune from sanctions, we would\nall seek our own interest without restraint. We find a similar\ndown-grading of convention in favor of nature (though one lacking the\nimmoralist conclusions) in Hippias\u2019 speech in the\nProtagoras (337c\u2013d), where he urges that intellectuals\nsuch as are gathered in the house of Callias ought not to quarrel,\nsince, though according to artificial political conventions they are\ncitizens of many different cities, by nature they are all akin. The\nconventions which make them treat each other as strangers distort the\nreality by which they are all alike; hence they should recognise that\nreality by treating each other as friends and members of the same\nfamily, not as strangers. (The vignette gains added point from the\nfact that Hippias, speaking in Athens, is a citizen of Elis, a\nPeloponnesian state allied to Sparta in the war against Athens.)\nOutside Plato the most extended and explicit expression of the\n\u2018antinomian\u2019 stance is a well-known papyrus fragment of\nAntiphon (DK 87B44), which presents a number of contrasts between the\nrequirements of conventional morality and those of nature, to the\ndisadvantage of the former. Nature prompts us to do only what is\nadvantageous to us, and if we try to act contrary to its promptings we\ninevitably suffer for it as a natural consequence, whereas morality\ntypically restrains us from doing what is advantageous to ourselves\nand requires us to do what is disadvantageous, and if we violate the\nrequirements of morality we come to harm only if we are found\nout. Legal remedies are insufficient to prevent the law-abiding person\nfrom harm, since they are applicable only after the harm has been\ndone, and there is always the chance that the law-abiding person will\nlose his case anyway. Another part of the papyrus (fragment B)\nsuggests that some legal norms are self-contradictory; it is just to\nbear true witness in court, and unjust to wrong someone who has not\nwronged you. So someone who bears true witness against someone who has\nnot wronged him (e.g., witness A who truly testifies that he\nsaw B murder C) wrongs the person against whom he\nbears witness, and therefore acts both justly and unjustly. (The\nargument here depends on an illicit assimilation of harming with\nwronging: the witness certainly harms the murderer by his true\ntestimony, assuming that it leads to his conviction and execution, but\nthere is no reason to agree that in giving that testimony the witness\nwrongs the murderer.) Moreover, he thereby puts himself in danger of\nretaliation by the person whom he has wronged; so once again obedience\nto nomos is disadvantageous.\n\n\nOn the other side of the debate, as we have seen, we have\nProtagoras\u2019 contention in the Great Speech that law and morality\nare themselves natural developments, necessary for human survival and\nthe growth of civilization. Protagoras agrees with Glaucon that moral\nand legal conventions arise ultimately from the need for cooperation in\na hostile world, but rejects the latter\u2019s Thrasymachean egoism,\nwith its implication that morality is merely a second-best, to be\nrejected if circumstances allow the individual to pursue his natural\ngoal of unrestrained self-interest. Morality, for Protagoras, consists\nin justice and self-restraint, dispositions which involve the\nreplacement of Thrasymachean egoism by genuine regard for others as of\nequal moral status with oneself, and the crucial lesson of the Great\nSpeech is that those dispositions, so far from requiring the stunting\nof human nature as Glaucon maintains, in fact constitute the perfection\nof that nature. The idea that law and morality arise from the\nexigencies of human nature is also found in some fragments of\nDemocritus and in the so-called \u2018Anonymous Iamblichi\u2019 (DK\n89), a fragmentary text from the late fifth or early fourth century BCE\npreserved by the neo-Platonist Iamblichus (third\u2013fourth century CE: see\nTaylor 2007). This defence of the authority of nomos rests on\nthe idea that nomos itself, in the sense of legal and moral\nconvention, arises from phusis. A different, though related,\ndefence of nomos assumes a distinction between on the one hand\nthe moral and legal conventions of particular societies, assumed to be\nthe product of human agreement, and on the other certain fundamental\nmoral norms, alleged to be common to all societies, whose origin is to\nbe traced, not to any agreement, but to the original constitution of\nhuman nature, traditionally attributed to the creation of humans by the\ngods; these norms were generally agreed to include the obligations to\nrespect one\u2019s parents and to worship the gods. The conception of\nnatural or unwritten law is frequently appealed to in oratory and\ndrama, notably Sophocles\u2019 Antigone (see Guthrie 1969 pp.\n77\u20139, 117\u201331 and Taylor 2008); one of its most extended expressions\noccurs in Xenophon\u2019s Memorabilia IV.4.14\u201325, where in\nconversation with Socrates the sophist Hippias is represented as saying\nthat since the unwritten laws are common to all countries, they cannot\nhave arisen from agreement among humans who spoke different languages,\nand as being persuaded by Socrates that breach of such laws inevitably\nleads to bad consequences, thus guaranteeing the rationality of this\ndivine legislation. There is, then, no uniform sophistic position in\nthe nomos-phusis debate; different sophists, or associates of\nsophists, are found among the disputants on either side.\n3. Religion\n\n\nFrom its beginnings, Greek speculations about the origin and nature\nof the cosmos had a theological dimension, in that various early\nthinkers attributed divinity either to the cosmos as a whole (as in\nHeraclitus\u2019 \u2018ever-living fire\u2019 (DK 31B30)) or to the\nfundamental cosmic principle or principles (so Anaximander is reported\nas regarding the Infinite (DK 12A15 (Aristotle)) and Anaximenes air (DK\n13A10 (Aetius, Cicero)) as divine, that is, eternal and intelligent).\nSuch speculations were not without their implications for the\ntraditional Olympian pantheon; Xenophanes clearly intends to mock the\ncultural relativity of anthropomorphism, pointing out that different\nraces of humans depict their gods in their own image, and suggesting\nthat if horses and cattle could draw they would do the same (DK\n21B15\u201316). On the positive side he proclaims a single supreme\nnon-anthropomorphic divinity, which appears to be identified either\nwith the cosmos itself or with its intelligent directive force (DK\n21B23\u20136). This type of theology is naturalistic, but non-reductive;\nHeraclitus is not saying that God is nothing but cosmic fire, implying\nthat that fire is not really divine, but rather that divinity, or the\ndivinities that matter, is not a super-hero like Apollo, but the\neverlasting, intelligent, self-directing cosmos itself. In the fifth\ncentury the naturalistic approach to religion exhibits a more reductive\naspect, with a consequent move towards a world-view which is not merely\nnaturalistic, but in the modern sense secular. Some sophists\ncontributed to that process of secularisation.\n\n\nIt is convenient to start with Anaxagoras, who, though not generally\ncounted as a sophist, in that he did not offer instruction in how to\nlive or teach rhetoric, nevertheless shared the scientific interests of\nsophists such as Hippias, and personified the growing rationalistic\napproach to natural phenomena. When he said that the sun was a molten\nrock, larger than the Peloponnese (Diogenes Laertius II.8, cf. Plato, Apology\n26d), he did mean that it was nothing other than a rock, i.e., not a\ndivine being, and he was rightly considered as challenging traditional\nviews of natural phenomena as divinely significant. Plutarch\u2019s\nstory (Life of Pericles 6) of the one-horned ram neatly\nencapsulates the opposed world-views: a ram with one horn in the middle\nof its forehead was brought to Pericles, and the soothsayer Lampon\ninterpreted it as a portent signifying the forthcoming triumph of\nPericles in his political struggle with his rival Thucydides.\nAnaxagoras dissected the animal\u2019s skull and showed that the\nsingle horn grew naturally out of a deformity of the brain. So,\nPlutarch reports, the people admired Anaxagoras (but admired Lampon\neven more when Thucydides was ostracized soon afterwards). The\nnaturalistic approach to meteorology etc. is not as such inconsistent\nwith belief in divinities, and though Anaxagoras does not explicitly\ndescribe his cosmic Nous as divine, his description of it as\nknowing, controlling and organizing everything (DK 59B12) strongly\nsuggests that he thought that it was. Among the phenomena for which\nreductive explanations were offered in the fifth century was the origin\nof religious belief itself. There is an indication of this in\nDemocritus DK 68B30 (preserved by Clement of Alexandria): \u2018A few\nlearned people, holding up their hands towards what we Greeks now call\nthe air, said \u201cZeus thinks of all things and he knows all things\nand gives and takes away, and he is king of all things\u201d\u2009\u2019,\nwhich is supported by the testimony of Sextus (Against the Mathematicians IX.24) that\nDemocritus said that belief in gods arose when primitive people were\nfrightened by thunder, lightning and other celestial phenomena. An\nalternative account, or rather two accounts, equally reductive, of the\norigin of religion is attributed to Prodicus, who is reported by\nvarious sources as holding that the names of gods were originally\napplied either to things which are particularly important in human\nlife, such as the sun, rivers, kinds of crops etc., or else to the\npeople who had originally discovered things of that kind (DK 84B5). It\nwas presumably on the basis of this that Prodicus was counted as an\natheist in antiquity (Aetius I.7.1, Cicero De Natura Deorum I.42.117); he\nwas understood, probably rightly, as meaning that in fact Demeter is\nnothing but corn, Dionysus nothing but wine, and so on. Most commentators agree that Prodicus was an atheist of some kind (for a dissenting view see Sedley 2013, at 329\u2013331), but there is some division of opinion on whether the atheism which he espoused was radical atheism, i.e. denial of the  existence of divine beings of any kind, or a more moderate version which denied the existence of the gods of popular and poetic tradition while allowing the divinity of cosmic items such as the heavenly bodies, water etc. (on the issue see Mayhew 2011, xvii, 183\u20134).  (For more recent discussions of Prodicus\u2019 views on religion, and of their connection with his views on cosmology and language see Kouloumentas 2018, Lebedev 2019 and Vassallo 2018.)\n    Atheism is more overt in the account of the origin of religion in a passage from a play\ncalled Sisyphus (DK 88B25), quoted by Sextus (Against the Mathematicians\nIX.54), attributed by DK and others on the authority of Sextus to the\nAthenian poet and oligarchic politician Critias, but now more usually\nthought to be by Euripides. The speaker (apparently Sisyphus himself)\nbegins with the picture of primitive human origins familiar from\nProtagoras\u2019 Great Speech: at first human life was bestial,\nunregulated by law, so humans invented laws to restrain mutual\naggression. But since legal sanctions were effective only when the\ncrime was discovered, someone \u2018stalwart and wise in his\nmind\u2019 invented the fiction that there are gods who live in the\nheavens, who see everything and punish evil-doing, even when it is\nsecret. Atheism is explicit; the stalwart and wise man \u2018concealed\nthe truth with a false account\u2019 (line 26). Of course atheism\nexpressed by a character in a play cannot be directly attributed to the\nauthor, whoever he was; this is merely one of the expressions in\nfifth-century drama of a wide range of attitudes to religion, ranging\nfrom outright atheism (e.g., Euripides Fragments 7, 286, \u2018Does then anyone say\nthere are gods in heaven? There are not, there are not, if a man is\nwilling not to give foolish credence to the ancient story\u2019) to\npious declaration of faith (Euripides Fragments 8, 912b, \u2018See, all you who think\nthe gods do not exist, how you are doubly in error with your poor\njudgment. They exist indeed, they exist\u2019). The significance of the\nSisyphus fragment is rather as further evidence of the fact\nthat in the late fifth century the rationalistic approach to the\nnatural world, including human nature, provided the intellectual\nfoundation of a range of views hostile to traditional religion,\nincluding explicit atheism. From Protagoras himself we have a\nfirst-person declaration, not of atheism, but of agnosticism, in what\nwas apparently the opening of his work On the Gods:\n\u2018Concerning the gods I am not able to know either that they exist\nor that they do not exist or what their nature is; for there are many\nthings which prevent one from knowing, both the unclarity (sc. of the\nsubject) and the short span of human life\u2019 (DK 80B4). According\nto some sources the outrage occasioned by this work led to his books\nbeing publicly burned and his being forced to flee from Athens to\nescape prosecution, and he is said by some to have drowned while trying\nto escape by sea (DK 80A1\u20134, 12). That story suggests that he was seen\nas a threat to traditional religion, much as Anaxagoras (and later\nSocrates) was, but the evidence of Plato\u2019s Meno 91e (see\nabove) gives an altogether different picture, since in that\npassage Socrates describes him as having had an unblemished reputation\nduring forty years of activity as a sophist, a reputation, moreover,\nwhich has lasted from his death till the present day, i.e., till the\ndramatic date of the dialogue in the last few years of the century.\nProtagoras\u2019 avowed agnosticism did not, then, provoke public\noutrage or even bring him into ill-repute, and it is worth considering\nwhy not. The answer may lie in his social relativism on matters of\nmorality (see above); it is probable that among the things which\n\u2018seem right and fine for each city\u2019 and which therefore\n\u2018are so for that city so long as it maintains them\u2019\n(Theaetetus 167c) are the prescriptions that it is right to honour\nthe gods by the traditional observances. (The verb nomizein,\nhere translated \u2018maintain\u2019, is regularly used to apply,\namong other things, both to religious belief and to ritual practice:\nthe wording of the accusation against Socrates, that \u2018he does not\nnomizei the gods whom the city nomizei\u2019 implies\nthat he neither believes in nor worships the gods of the city.) It is\nprobable, then, that Protagoras was supportive of traditional religious\npractice, while the wording of his proclamation of agnosticism does not\neven offer a direct challenge to conventional belief. He cannot know\nwhether or not the gods exist or what they are like; this presumably\n(though in the light of Protagorean subjectivism the inference is not\nas secure as it would otherwise be) implies that no-one can know these\nthings, but lack of knowledge is no bar to belief, particularly if that\nbelief is socially useful, as Protagoras probably thought it was.\nOverall, it is likely that Protagoras\u2019 position on religious\nbelief and practice was as conservative as his general social and moral\nviews. If Xenophon\u2019s portrayal of Hippias\u2019 moral stance\n(see above) is historically accurate, then he held a deeply traditional\nview of the gods as authors of the unwritten law.\n4. Other sophists\n\n\nAt Apology 19e\u201320c Plato represents Socrates as naming\nfour individuals who undertake to teach or educate people\n(paideuein anthr\u014dpous) in return for fees; they are\nGorgias (from Leontinoi in Sicily), Hippias (from Elis, in the\nnorth-western Peloponnese, Prodicus (from Ceos, off the southern tip\nof Attica) and Euenus (from Paros, in the southern Aegean). Of the\nfour only Euenus is expressly said to teach \u2018human and political\nexcellence\u2019 (t\u0113s \u2026 aret\u0113s \u2026\nanthr\u014dpin\u0113s te kai politik\u0113s, i.e., success in the\nrunning of one\u2019s life and in public affairs), but the context strongly\nsuggests that the other three are seen as offering the same kind of\ninstruction. Euenus is otherwise known chiefly as a poet (though Plato\nPhaedrus 267a mentions some contributions to rhetorical\ntheory), and his appearance in this context indicates the continuation\ninto the sophistic era of the older tradition of the poet as moral\nteacher (see above). If Gorgias is included in this context among the\nteachers of excellence, there is a difficulty in that at Meno\n95c Meno, a pupil of Gorgias, says that what he most admires about him\nis that not only does he never claim to teach excellence, but that he\nmakes fun of those who do. Consistently with that, in the dialogue\nnamed after him he begins by claiming that what he has to teach is not\nany system of values, but a technique of persuasion, which is in itself\nvalue-free, but is capable of being employed for whatever purposes,\ngood or bad, are adopted by the person who has mastered it, just as\nskill in martial arts can be used for good ends or bad (456a\u2013457c). But\nin fact the distinction is not so clear, since Gorgias is readily\ninduced to agree that a political orator has to know what is right and\nwrong, and that he (Gorgias) will teach his pupil those things if he\nhappens not to know them already (460a\u2013c). Perhaps it is assumed that\nnormally the pupil will know in advance what is right and wrong, so\nGorgias will not have to teach him that, and can concentrate on the\nessential skill of persuasion. But the point of learning to persuade\nwill be to gain power over others, and thereby to achieve personal and\npolitical success. So Gorgias will rightly be counted among the\nteachers of excellence; what is distinctive about his teaching is the\nprominence of persuasion in the achievement of excellence. But\npersuasion, though central, was not everything. At the opening of the\ndialogue (447d\u2013448a) Gorgias claims to be able to answer any question\nanyone puts to him, and says that for many years no-one has asked him\nanything new, which seems to mean \u2018asked me any question to which\nI didn\u2019t already know the answer\u2019 (see also Meno\n70b). Making this claim seems to commit him to the kind of encyclopedic\nknowledge which we find Hippias displaying (see below). His extant\nwritings include display speeches, purportedly in defence of Helen and\nPalamedes against charges of treachery (DK 82B11 and 11a); they seem to\nbe intended partly as examples of stylistic brilliance for its own sake\nand partly as demonstration of skill in adversarial argument,\n\u2018making the weaker argument the stronger\u2019 (see above). In\naddition, we have a philosophical essay \u2018On Non-Being or On\nNature\u2019 (DK 82B3), purporting to be a rebuttal of Parmenides, in\nwhich he maintains that nothing exists, that if anything did exist it\ncould not be known and that if anything could be known it could not be\ncommunicated. Scholarly opinion has been and remains divided as to\nwhether this was intended as a parody of Eleatic writing or as a\nserious piece of philosophy. What can definitely be said is that it\nshows some knowledge of Parmenides, that it at least raises serious\nphilosophical questions, such as the relation of thought to reality and\nthe possibility of referring to things which do not exist, that no\nquestion which it raises is developed to any significant extent and\nthat most of its arguments are extremely feeble. It reads like a piece\nwritten by a clever man with no real interest in philosophy, but it is\ndoubtful whether we shall ever know why he wrote it.\n\n\nHippias was above all a polymath. He first appears in the\nProtagoras (315c) sitting in a professorial chair giving\ndetailed answers to questions on science generally and astronomy in\nparticular, and later (318e) Protagoras in effect accuses him of\ndefrauding his pupils by making them study arithmetic, geometry,\nastronomy and mousik\u0113 (music and poetry) instead\nof concentrating on teaching excellence. In the Greater\nHippias (285b\u2013e) he describes how he lectured at Sparta on\ngenealogy and all aspects of ancient history, and he is variously\nreported as lecturing on painting and sculpture, as having developed a\nmnemonic technique which enabled him to repeat a list of fifty names\nafter a single hearing (both DK 86A2 (Philostratus)), and as appearing\nat the Olympic Games wearing and carrying nothing which he had not made\nhimself, down to his signet-ring (Lesser Hippias 368b). His\nwritings included a list of Olympic victors and a work entitled\nSynag\u014dg\u0113, \u2018Collection\u2019 or\n\u2018Miscellany\u2019, which seems to have been a compendium of\nmiscellaneous information collected from the poets and other sources,\nboth Greek and foreign (DK 86B6 (Clement)). At the Olympic Games he\ngave speeches on any subject anyone proposed, and like Gorgias,\nanswered any question anyone put to him (Lesser Hippias\n363c), and in the same dialogue (346a) he says that since he began\ncompeting (ag\u014dnizesthai) at the games he has never been\nbeaten. Presumably the competitions were eristic contests (see\nabove). Like Protagoras and Prodicus he taught the correct use of\nlanguage (Lesser Hippias 368d), and despite Protagoras\u2019\nstricture, he also offered the standard sophistic fare of poetic\nexegesis (Protagoras 347b, Lesser Hippias passim) and\nmoral and practical instruction (Greater Hippias  286a\u2013c). We\nsaw above that his moral and religious stance was conservative, and\nhis championing of phusis against\nnomos (see above) is rather an appeal to cosmopolitan elitism\nthan any kind of challenge to conventional morality. Perhaps more than\nany other single person he encapsulates the complexity of the sophistic\nphenomenon.\n\n\nProdicus\u2019 position on religion was discussed earlier. Apart\nfrom it he is best known for his insistence on the correct use of\nlanguage (Plato, Euthydemus 277e), in particular fine\ndiscriminations of the senses of near-synonyms, a topic in which he\nseems to have specialised. Plato gives numerous examples in the\nProtagoras (especially 337a\u2013c) and in other dialogues (for\ndetails see DK 84A13\u201318), and Socrates says (Cratylus 384b)\nthat he has attended Prodicus\u2019 \u2018one-drachma\u2019 lecture\non names, but was unfortunately unable to afford the full course, for\nwhich the fee was fifty drachmas (a drachma being a day\u2019s wage\nfor a skilled craftsman at this period). He is reported as having had\nsome interest in natural philosophy, including astronomy (DK 84AI\n(Suda), A5 (Aristophanes) and B3 (Galen)), and as having applied his\nlinguistic theory to medical terminology (DK 84B4 (Galen)). All that\nhas survived of his writings is a paraphrase by Xenophon\n(Memorabilia II.1.21\u201334) of his moral fable of the choice of\nHeracles between Virtue and Vice. In this story Heracles is approached\nat a cross-road by two female figures representing Virtue and Vice,\neach of whom tries to persuade him to follow her by describing the\nattractions of a life with her. Both base their appeal on pleasure,\nVice stressing the meretricious allurements of the voluptuous life,\nwhile Virtue offers the genuine and lasting pleasures of the life of\nhonesty and sobriety, including good reputation and the favor of the\ngods, an appeal which wins the day. In contrast to his radical views on\nreligion, the moral stance expressed here is thoroughly\nconventional. (Mayhew 2011 xiv-xvii gives a useful summary of the basics of Prodicus\u2019 treatment of language.)\n\nFor information on other sophists see Guthrie 1969, ch. 11, and (in\nGerman) Kerferd & Flashar 1998 (secs. 5, Thrasymachus; 8,\nAntiphon; and 11, minor sophists).\n\n\nThe major sophists were considerable celebrities, and were active in\npublic affairs. The Protagoras captures the excitement which\nthey engendered on arriving in a city, the cosmopolitan clientele who\naccompanied them and their associations with the rich and powerful.\nSome made a great deal of money; Hippias boasts (Greater\nHippias 282e) of making, in a single visit to Sicily, more\nthan a hundred and fifty minas, i.e., fifteen thousand drachmas,\nsomething in the region of thirty years\u2019 wages for a skilled\ncraftsman, and Socrates says (Meno 91d) that Protagoras earned\nmore than ten sculptors, including the celebrated Phidias. Protagoras\ndrew up the law-code for the foundation of the Athenian colony of\nThurii in 444/3 (Diogenes Laertius IX.50), and Gorgias, Hippias, Prodicus and\npossibly also Thrasymachus acted as diplomatic representatives of their\nrespective cities. But their wealth and celebrity status has to be set\nagainst the negative reaction they aroused in those of conservative\nviews, e.g. Anytus in Meno 89e\u201394e, who saw them (to\na considerable extent unfairly, as we have seen) as subversive of\nmorality and religion and a bad influence on the young. According to\nPlato in the Apology, it was that climate of opinion, most\nstrikingly expressed in Aristophanes\u2019 Clouds, which had\nled eventually to the condemnation of Socrates on grounds of irreligion\nand the corruption of the young. Consequently, his rehabilitation of\nSocrates leads him to contrast the genuine philosopher with the\nsophists, whom he depicts predominantly as charlatans. That hostile\nportrait was the historical foundation of the conception of the sophist\nas a dishonest argumentative trickster, a conception which remains the\nprimary sense of the word in modern usage, but which considerably\ndistorts what can be recovered of the historical reality.\n", "bibliography": {"categories": ["<a name=\"Tex\">Texts</a>", "<a name=\"ModDis\">Modern Discussions</a>"], "cat_ref_text": {"<a name=\"Tex\">Texts</a>": ["</h3>\n<ul class=\"hanging\">", "Barnes, J.
