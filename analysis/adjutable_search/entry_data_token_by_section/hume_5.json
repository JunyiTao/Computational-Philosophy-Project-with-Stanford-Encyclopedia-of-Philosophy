    "main_text": "Account of the Mind || Hume\u2019s Account of Definition\n4.2 Hume\u2019s Account of Definition\n\nAlthough Hume\u2019s distinctive brand of empiricism is often\nidentified with his commitment to the Copy Principle, his use of the\nprinciple\u2019s reverse in his account of definition is perhaps the\nmore innovative element of his system.\n\nAs his diagnosis of traditional metaphysics reveals, Hume believes\nthat\n\n\nthe chief obstacle \u2026 to our improvement in the moral or\nmetaphysical sciences is the obscurity of the ideas, and ambiguity of\nthe terms. (EHU 7.1.2/61)\n\n\nConventional definitions\u2014replacing terms with their\nsynonyms\u2014merely replicate philosophical confusions and never\nbreak out of a narrow definitional circle. Getting clear about the\ncontent of the ideas and the meanings of the terms we are\ninvestigating requires something else.\n\nHume argues that we must \u201cpass from words to the true and real\nsubject of the controversy\u201d\u2014ideas. He believes he has\nfound a way to accurately determine their content\u2014his account of\ndefinition. He touts it as \u201ca new microscope or species of\noptics\u201d, predicting that it will produce equally dramatic\nresults in the moral sciences as its hardware\ncounterparts\u2014telescopes and microscopes\u2014have produced in\nnatural philosophy (EHU 7.1.4/62).\n\nHume\u2019s account of definition uses a simple series of tests to\ndetermine cognitive content. Begin with a term. Ask what idea is\nannexed to it. If there is no such idea, then the term has no\ncognitive content, however prominently it figures in philosophy or\ntheology. If there is an idea annexed to the term, and it is complex,\nbreak it down into the simple ideas that compose it, and trace them\nback to their original impressions. If the process fails at any point,\nthe idea in question lacks cognitive content. When carried through\nsuccessfully, however, it yields a \u201cjust\ndefinition\u201d\u2014a precise account of the troublesome\nidea\u2019s content.\n\nHume uses his account of definition in the critical phaseof\nhis project to show that many of the central concepts of traditional\nmetaphysics lack intelligible content. He also uses it in the\nconstructive phase to determine the exact meaning of our\nterms and ideas.\n",
