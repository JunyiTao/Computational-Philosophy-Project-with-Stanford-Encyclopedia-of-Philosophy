    "main_text": "States of Affairs as Complexes || Are States of Affairs Ontologically Dependent?\n5.3 Are States of Affairs Ontologically Dependent?\n\nFine (1982: 51\u20132) has suggested an answer that invokes the\nindependently motivated idea that the identity of some objects is\nexplained in terms of the identity of other objects (see also Fine\n1995; Bynoe 2011: 99\u2013100; and Keller 2013: 669). Consider\nFine\u2019s example of the singleton of 1. The singleton of 1 is the\nset whose sole member is 1. The singleton of 1 is ontologically\ndependent on 1 because its identity depends on the identity of 1. We\nexplain what the singleton is by appealing to 1, but not the other way\naround. Similarly, the identity of (atomic) states of affairs is\nexplained in terms of objects and properties. Fine (1982: 52) takes\nbasic states of affairs\u2014propositions in his\nterminology\u2014to be the results of the application of the\noperation of predication to particulars and properties. We say what\nthe state of affairs a\u2019s being F is by\nsaying that it is the result of predicating being F to\na. Hence, the state of affairs a\u2019s being\nF depends on predicating being F to\na. Complex states of affairs are the result of the\napplication of such operations as conjunction and disjunction to basic\nstates of affairs (on Operationalism as a general approach see Fine\n2010: 564ff). The notion of predication gives rise to several\nquestions and we will come back to it in the next section.\n\nIf states of affairs are ontologically dependent on particulars and\nproperties, we can satisfy the desiderata (i) to (iii):\n\n(i) An object can ontologically depend on other objects without being\na complex that contains these objects as parts. The axis of the earth\nontologically depends on the Earth, but it does not contain the Earth\nas a constituent. The assumption that the state of affairs\na\u2019s being F ontologically depends on\na and F can therefore solve the problems that arise for\nthe assumption that it contains a and F. Take for\nexample Frege\u2019s intuitive argument against the view that states\nof affairs contain physical objects like Vesuvius. The state of\naffairs Vesuvius\u2019s being a volcano ontologically\ndepends on Vesuvius, but it does not contain it as a part. Hence, it\ndoes not contain the lava parts that are the parts of Vesuvius. There\nis no need to ascribe weight etc. to the state of affairs.\n\nOntological dependence helps us to get around the temporal problems\nraised by the logical complex view of states of affairs. While a\ncomplex cannot exist at a time at which some of its parts don\u2019t\nexist, an object can ontologically depend on objects that no longer\nexist. (I ontologically depend on a particular event, the\nfertilization of a particular egg by a particular sperm, although this\nevent is long past.)\n\n(ii) Fine\u2019s proposal suggests that states of affairs are\nindividuated in terms of the objects and relations in virtue of which\nthey exist:\n\n(Same2) If \\(S_1\\) and\n\\(S_2\\) are states of affairs, \\(S_1 = S_2\\) if, and only if, \\(S_1\\)\nand \\(S_2\\) exist in virtue of the same properties predicated of the\nsame particulars.\n\n\nThis criterion of identity for states of affairs distinguishes between\nthe necessarily co-obtaining states of affairs Hesperus\u2019s\nbeing self-identical and Socrates\u2019 being\nself-identical because they ontologically depend on different\nthings. Hence, they come out as different. In turn,\nHesperus\u2019s being a planet and Phosphorus\u2019s\nbeing a planet come out, as it is desirable, as the same state of\naffairs.\n\n(iii) If the state of affairs Hesperus\u2019s being a planet\nontologically depends on Hesperus, it can only exist if Hesperus\nexists at some time. In contrast, a thought can exist whether or not\nthe objects it purports to be about ever existed or will exist. The\nthought that Pegasus is a horse exists, whether there is such a horse\nor not.\n\nThe notion of ontological dependence sheds light on the sense in which\nstates of affairs \u201cinvolve\u201d particulars and properties: a\nstate of affairs involves those objects on which it ontologically\ndepends. Consider as a representative example Richard\u2019s 2013\nview of propositions as states of affairs. He identifies states of\naffairs with ways for things to be. A way for things to be is, in\nturn, identified by the things and the way these things need to be for\nthe way for things to be to be how things are. A way for things to be\nis a property the world might have. The existence of this property\ndepends on the existence of the properties and particulars we need to\nrefer to in identifying it. If there is no Eiffel Tower, for example,\nthere is no way for the Eiffel Tower to be. Hence, states of affairs\nontologically depend on particulars and properties. Richard (2013:\n704) goes a step further by saying that ontological dependence is\n\u201ca mark of mereological relations\u201d. Hence, states of\naffairs should have constituent structure. But the additional claim\nthat states of affairs are (in some sense) wholes with parts does not\nexplain more than the ontological dependence claim. Rather the\nopposite: it leads to the problems discussed above.\n\nThe notion of ontological dependence helps to articulate how states of\naffairs are related to particulars and properties. But the ontological\ndependence of states of affairs on properties and particulars is not\nbrute. It is because some properties are predicated of some objects\nthat (i) they form a state of affairs (ii) such that this state of\naffairs depends on them and can be said to involve them. A fundamental\nquestion about states of affairs concerns then the conditions of\npredicability. We will come back to this question in section 6.3.\n",
