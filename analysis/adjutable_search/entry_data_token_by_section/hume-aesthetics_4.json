    "main_text": "Beauty and Taste in Hume\u2019s Moral Theory || Imagination and Point of View\n3.3 Imagination and Point of View\u00a0\n\nInformed understanding makes a vital contribution to most aesthetic\nand moral judgment (EPM, 173; SOT, 277). For Hume, taste is improved\nby practice in making \u201ccomparisons\u201d among objects (SOT,\n275) and by the employment of \u201cgood sense\u201d (SOT, 277).\n\n\nHume blurs traditional distinctions between thinking and imagining.\nThoughts would not extend beyond our actual experiences were it not\nfor the imaginative associations established by the force of\nrepetition or \u201ccustom\u201d (T, 170; EHU, 43). Learned\nassociations encourage us to rearrange our ideas in intelligible\npatterns, permitting us to create ideas of things never actually\nexperienced (e.g., fictitious creatures or distant places).\nImagination also creates chains of associated ideas, encouraging\nthoughts to move rapidly from one idea to another.\n\nGood taste therefore presupposes an active imagination. Suppose one\nwakes in the morning and smells the distinctive aroma of coffee, and\nthe experience is pleasurable. This appreciation depends on a learned,\nimaginative association: the smell brings to mind its cause, the\nbrewing coffee, and its purpose, the consumption of the coffee. The\nagreeable sentiment is a response to this complex association of\nimpressions and ideas, not to the smell alone. Critical evaluation is\ntherefore highly contextual: \u201cThe passion, in pronouncing its\nverdict, considers not the object simply, as it is in itself, but\nsurveys it with all the circumstances, which attend it\u201d (S,\n224).\n\nIt is important to recognize that Humean imagination is not a free and\nunrestrained activity. It is constrained by a relatively small set of\npermanent principles of imaginative association (T, 10, 225; EHU, 24).\nAlthough poets may \u201cprofess to follow implicitly the suggestions\nof their fancy\u201d (T, 225), their poetry has little chance of\npleasing others if their \u201cfancy\u201d or imagination employs\nirregular associations. The universal principles of imaginative\nassociation allow artists to predict how their representational and\nnarrative designs will move audiences. With artworks, the intentions\nof the artist must be considered, a point emphasized by Jones (1976,\npp. 55\u201356), and Jones (2009).\n\nHume recognizes a very small class of cases for which imaginative\nassociation is not needed to recognize beauty. In these cases, initial\nimpressions of the mere \u201cform\u201d of a material object\ngenerate approbation (T, 364). Such cases are more typical of natural\nbeauty than art (EPM, 173). So imagination is not always necessary for\ndiscovering beauty. Pleasing form is sometimes sufficient. However,\n\u201c\u2019tis seldom we rest there\u201d (T, 363).\n\nSo Hume does not advocate a simple causal relationship between form\nand sentiment. In most cases, our beliefs about the object alter our\nsentiments. Forms are generally most pleasing when \u201cthe order\nand construction of parts\u201d (T, 299) suggests a corresponding\nutility for humans or expresses agreeable emotions. These suggestions\nneed not be accurate in order to trigger approbation and\ndisapprobation. A particular object might appear balanced, graceful,\nand beautiful despite our knowledge of its limited utility (T, 584).\nObjects may displease taste despite their genuine utility.\n\nA house may displease me by being ill-contrived for the convenience of\nthe owner; and yet I may refuse to give a shilling towards the\nrebuilding of it. Sentiments must touch the heart, to make them\ncontroul our passions: But they need not extend beyond the\nimagination, to make them influence our taste. When a building seems\nclumsy and tottering to the eye, it is ugly and disagreeable; though\nwe be fully assured of the solidity of the workmanship. \u2018Tis a\nkind of fear, which causes this sentiment of disapprobation; but the\npassion is not the same with that which we feel, when obliged to stand\nunder a wall, that we really think tottering and insecure. The\nseeming tendencies of objects affect the mind: And the\nemotions they excite are of a like species with those, which proceed\nfrom the real consequences of objects, but their feeling is\ndifferent. Nay, these emotions are so different in their feeling, that\nthey may often be contrary, without destroying each other; as when the\nfortifications of a city belonging to an enemy are esteemed beautiful\nupon account of their strength, though we could wish that they were\nentirely destroyed. The imagination adheres to the general\nviews of things, and distinguishes the feelings they produce, from\nthose which arise from our particular and momentary situation (T,\n586\u201387).\n\n\nHume\u2019s views on the aesthetic relevance of form and utility are\nexplored by Carolyn Korsmeyer (1976), while utility is emphasized by\nTaylor (2011). Given Hume\u2019s debt to Hutcheson, Korsmeyer notes\nthat it is tempting to read such passages as foreshadowing the\nsubsequent theory of aesthetic response as \u201cdisinterested\u201d\npleasure. However, we should be careful here. Hume uses the term\n\u201cdisinterest\u201d as the contrary of \u201cself-love\u201d\n(EPM, 296), but he does not use the term in relation to aesthetic\nsentiment. Hume\u2019s \u201ccommon,\u201d \u201cuniversal,\u201d\nor \u201cgeneral view of things\u201d is a simpler proposal. He\nwants to remind us that we cannot expect the agreement of others if we\njudge things from a limited and prejudiced perspective (EPM, 272).\n\nRelations of form and function can operate at an extremely abstract\nlevel: \u201cA building, whose doors and windows were exact squares,\nwould hurt the eye by that very proportion: as ill adapted to the\nfigure of a human creature, for whose service the fabric was\nintended\u201d (EPM, 212\u201313). Those who respond with sentiment\nare moved by \u201cimaginary\u201d and general consequences, not\nsimply utility for the person passing judgment (EPM, 217\u201318).\nFurthermore, formal design itself can convey emotions which influence\naesthetic response: \u201cThere is no rule in painting or statuary\nmore indispensable than that of balancing the figures, and placing\nthem with the greatest exactness on their proper centre of gravity. A\nfigure, which is not justly balanced, is ugly; because it conveys the\ndisagreeable ideas of fall, harm, and pain\u201d (EPM, 245).\n\nThus, Hume blocks the conclusion that all taste is equal by\ndistinguishing between two points of view that we can adopt toward any\nperson, object, or action. We can respond from the point of view of\nour own self-interest. But this response is prejudiced and often\nproduces \u201ca false relish\u201d (EPM, 173). Or we can respond\nfrom the general point of view, a reflective evaluation that is not\nmotivated by self-interest. The general point of view is influenced by\nmyriad beliefs about the object and its context. For example,\nbelieving that something is rare greatly magnifies our pleasure (S,\n224). Where self-interest might make me jealous of your new home and\nwill interfere with the sentiment of beauty, a reflective response\nwill allow me to appreciate its construction and design.\n\nFor Hume, normative conflicts can only be resolved by moving to a\nproperly informed general perspective, with \u201cjust conclusions\ndrawn, distant comparisons formed, complicated relations examined, and\ngeneral facts fixed and ascertained\u201d (EPM, 173). The essay on\ntaste defends this position and outlines a theory of how critics can\nplace themselves in such a position:\n\nwhen any work is addressed to the public, though I should have a\nfriendship or enmity with the author, I must depart from this\nsituation; and considering myself as a man in general, forget, if\npossible, my individual being and my peculiar circumstances. A person\ninfluenced by prejudice, complies not with this condition; but\nobstinately maintains his natural position, without placing himself in\nthat point of view, which the performance supposes (SOT,\n276\u201377).\n\n\nHume also invokes the operation of a sympathetic sentiment. Since\nsympathy plays an important role in his moral theory (T, 577; EPM,\n225), he must include it in his aesthetic theory if he is to sustain\nthe close ties he posits between morals and aesthetics. The general\npoint of view takes notice of pleasure that the object is fitted to\nbring to other people. The idea of their benefit generates sympathetic\npleasure, increasing the sentiment of approbation (T,\n364\u201365).\n\nHowever, Hume\u2019s claim that most judgments of beauty require some\nelement of sympathy (T, 363) becomes harder to maintain in cases of\nfine art. It is not clear how the appreciation of a sonnet or melody\ninvolves an idea of the value it has for others. Hume occasionally\ntalks as if artistic beauty is entirely a question of formal design.\nAnd he seems to think that the utility and therefore value of some art\nis the pleasure it affords (e.g., with poetry), as if he advocates an\nearly art-for-art\u2019s-sake position. This interpretation is an\nobvious consequence of any interpretation that takes Hume to say that\nan object\u2019s capacity to provide pleasure exhausts its aesthetic\nvalue. (This reading is endorsed by Levinson (2002) and challenged by\nShelley (2011, 2013.) But the fact that a poem pleases someone else,\nor even large numbers of people, does not encourage sympathetic\napprobation for the poem.\n\nA careful reading suggests that Hume neither separates the fine arts\nfrom the other arts nor places sympathy at the center of aesthetic\nresponse. From the start, he recognizes multiple reasons for\napprobation. He hypothesizes a general but not universal connection\nbetween artificial and natural forms and the appearance of utility (T,\n195). He offers examples of basic design in painting (T, 364\u201365)\nand of \u201cunharmonious\u201d literature (EPM, 224). Poetry has an\nobvious formal element. Reading begins with impressions of dark shapes\narranged in lines on white pages. Readers silently associate the\nprinted text with aural ideas (the voice of a human speaker). Through\nimaginative association, literary forms have expressive human\ncharacters that elicit sympathetic pleasure and pain. Yet a reader who\nis not engaged by the subject matter may still find value in the\n\u201cstyle and ingenuity of the composition\u201d (T, 98). Because\nHume does not operate with assumptions about the uniqueness of fine\nart, his theory cuts across the distinction between fine art and\nrhetoric. Good design and eloquence are beautiful and desirable in all\nartifacts and speech, not merely in fine art (E).\n\nWhere appropriate, the refined taste of a good critic will weigh the\nrelative contributions of all aspects of the object of taste. Formal\ndesign is a contributing excellence and not the sole focus of\naesthetic discrimination. To arrive at a proper moral judgment,\n\u201call the circumstances and relations must be previously known;\nand the mind, from the contemplation of the whole, feels some new\nimpression of affection or disgust, esteem or contempt, approbation or\nblame\u201d (EPM, 290). Aesthetic discrimination works in the same\nway (EPM, 291). In some situations, a single inharmonious element can\nupset the beauty of the whole. Hume discusses such cases in \u201cOf\nthe Standard of Taste.\u201d But then what of tragic literature, in\nwhich sympathy produces ongoing unease? How can there be an impression\nof approbation for a tragic play? Hume addresses this problem in\n\u201cOf Tragedy.\u201d\n\nIn the wake of reader-response criticism, Hume is frequently\nchallenged for not making enough allowances for the legitimate\ndifferences that readers bring to the same piece of writing. No two\nreaders will respond with the same associations of ideas. So how can\nHume hypothesize a convergence of critical response? As a criticism of\nHume, this reply backfires. Hume concedes, \u201ceach mind perceives\na different beauty\u201d (SOT, 268). But he recognizes an even more\nradical problem. He admits that every stable object is really a\n\u201cfiction\u201d posited by the operations of imagination and\nsentiment. We always \u201cbestow on the objects a greater regularity\nthan what is observed in our mere perceptions\u201d (T, 197).\nHowever, this philosophical grasp of the situation has no practical\neffect in making anyone skeptical of the existence of houses, trees,\nand books. It does not detract from the truth and falsity of what we\nordinarily say about them. Novels and plays and paintings are not\nspecial cases. Admitting that they call for complex operations of\nimagination does not differentiate them from other objects and should\nnot count against the possibility of critical judgment.\n\nThe crux of the problem is the difference between saying that\nHamlet is a play by William Shakespeare and saying that\nHamlet is a flawed play. The former claim expresses a matter\nof fact; the latter expresses a normative judgment. Both judgements\nstem from complex imaginative associations. The presence of\nimaginative thought poses no special problem for the convergence of\nevaluative discrimination. Hume\u2019s primary problem is to explain\nhow sentiment, as the essential source of value judgments, is subject\nto principled dispute. Hume directly confronts this problem in\n\u201cOf the Standard of Taste.\u201d\n",
