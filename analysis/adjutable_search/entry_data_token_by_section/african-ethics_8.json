    "main_text": "The Ethics of Duty, Not of Rights\n9. The Ethics of Duty, Not of Rights\n\n\nAfrican ethics, is a humanitarian ethics, the kind of ethics that\nplaces a great deal of emphasis on human welfare. The concern for\nhuman welfare may be said to constitute the hub of the African\naxiological wheel. This orientation of African ethics takes its\nimpulse, undoubtedly, from the humanistic outlook that characterizes\ntraditional African life and thought. Humanism\u2014the doctrine that\nsees human needs and interests as fundamental\u2014thus constitutes\nthe foundation of African ethics (see section 5 above).\n\n\nNow, the natural sociality or relationality of the human being that\nwould prescribe social ethic (see preceding section) would also\nprescribe the ethic of duty (or, responsibility). The natural\nrelationality of the individual immediately involves one in some social\nand moral roles in the form of obligations, commitments, and duties\n(or, responsibilities) to other members of his or her community which\nthe individual must fulfill. Social or community life itself, a robust\nfeature of the African communitarian society, mandates a morality that\nclearly is weighted on duty to others and to the community; it\nconstitutes the foundation for moral responsibilities and\nobligations.\n\n\nThere appears to be a conceptual tie\u2014perhaps also a practical\ntie\u2014between the social ethic prescribed by the communitarian\nethos and the ethic of duty mandated by the same ethos.\n\n\nA morality of duty is one that requires each individual to\ndemonstrate concern for the interests of others. The ethical values of\ncompassion, solidarity, reciprocity, cooperation, interdependence, and\nsocial well-being, which are counted among the principles of the\ncommunitarian morality, primarily impose duties on the individual with\nrespect to the community and its members. All these considerations\nelevate the notion of duties to a status similar to that given to the\nnotion of rights in Western ethics. African ethics does not give\nshort-shrift to rights as such; nevertheless, it does not give\nobsessional or blinkered emphasis on rights. In this morality duties\ntrump rights, not the other way around, as it is in the moral systems\nof Western societies. The attitude to, or performance of, duties is\ninduced by a consciousness of needs rather than of rights. In other\nwords, people fulfill\u2014and ought to fulfill\u2014duties to others not\nbecause of the rights of these others, but because of their needs and\nwelfare\n\n\nIt would be clear from the foregoing discussion that African ethics\ntakes a stand that would be against what are referred to as acts of\nsupererogation. A supererogatory act is defined as an act that is said\nto be \u2018beyond the call of duty\u2019; it is an act that is said\nto be over and above what a person is required to do as a moral agent.\nIn much of the literature on Western moral philosophy, an act of\nsupererogation is held not as a strictly moral duty. Thus, it\nis neither morally obligatory nor forbidden; therefore, it is not\nwrong, so the argument concludes, to omit or neglect performing it,\neven though it is good and commendable by virtue of its value and\nconsequences on others if it is performed. It is supposed to be a\nmeritorious act and yet optional, one that may be performed if the\nspirit moves you, but need not be performed. Thus, a distinction is\nmade in Western literature between moral duty and a supererogatory act,\nthe former considered obligatory and moral duty \u2018proper\u2019\nand the latter nonobligatory and optional, not being a\n\u2018proper\u2019 moral duty.\n\n\nSupererogationism is clearly an oxymoron: for, why should an act\nthat is good and morally commendable and will conduce to the well-being\nof another person (or, other persons) fail to exact obligation or\ncompel performance? We would normally think that there is a moral\nconnection between \u2018good\u2019 and \u2018ought\u2019, and that\ntherefore a morally good act ought to be performed: if an act is\nmorally good, then it ought to be performed.\n\n\nAfrican morality, which is humanitarian, social, and duty-oriented\nrather than rights-oriented morality, does not make a distinction\nbetween a moral duty and a supererogatory duty\u2014one that is beyond\nthe call of duty and so does not have to be performed. In the light of\nour common humanity, it would not be appropriate\u2014in fact it would\ndemean our humanity\u2014to place limits to our moral duties or\nresponsibilities. Even though it is true that, as human beings, we are\nlimited in many ways and so are not capable of fulfilling our moral\nduties to all human beings at all times as such, nevertheless, the\nscope of our moral duties should not be circumscribed. African\nhumanitarian ethics would seek to collapse moral duty and moral\nideals\u2014the latter being the basis of the so-called supererogatory\nduty\u2014into one capacious moral universe inhabited both by the\nmorality of duty \u2018proper\u2019, obligation, and justice\nand the morality of love, virtue, compassion, benevolence, and\nother \u201cmoral ideals\u201d. Such a capacious morality would make\nno distinction between a morally obligatory act and a morally optional\nact. It would insist that no act that is morally good in itself or that\nwill conduce to the well-being of some individual or group of\nindividuals should be considered morally optional, to be morally\nshrugged off or unconscionably set aside, if we understand morality to\nbe something that serves (or, should) serve human needs. Thus, as the\nsecond part of a previous quotation says,\n\n\nA native will give his best house and his evening meal to a\nguest, without the slightest thought that he is doing anything\nextraordinary (Dugald Campbell, section 6 above).\n\n\n\n\nThus, African ethics\u2014an ethics that is weighted on duty, not on\nrights\u2014would, in principle, not consider moral duty of any kind\nas extraordinary, optional, or supererogatory. The African humanitarian\nethic makes all people objects of moral concern, implying that our\nmoral sensitivities should be extended to all people, irrespective of\ntheir cultures or societies.\n",
