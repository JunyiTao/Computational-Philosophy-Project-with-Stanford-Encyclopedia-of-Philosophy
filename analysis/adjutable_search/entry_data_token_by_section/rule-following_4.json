    "main_text": "The Sceptical Solution\n3. The Sceptical Solution\n\nIf the sceptical argument is cogent, it seems to follow that there are\nno meaning-constituting facts, no facts in virtue of which linguistic\nexpressions mean one thing rather than another. As noted above, this\nappears to imply the paradoxical conclusion that \u201cthe entire\nidea of meaning vanishes into thin air\u201d (1982: 22). Kripke\ndistinguishes between two broad ways in which one might attempt to\navoid this conclusion (1982: 66\u20137). On the one hand, one might\nprovide a straight response, by identifying some\nmeaning-constituting fact of the sort called into question by the\nsceptic. The various proposals discussed briefly in\n section 2\n above are instances of straight responses. The two most prominent\ntypes of straight response in the literature\u2014reductive\ndispositionalism and non-reductionism\u2014are discussed in more\ndetail in\n section 4\n and\n section 5\n below. On the other hand, one might provide a sceptical\nresponse. That is, one might concede that there are no\nmeaning-constituting facts of the sort demanded by the sceptic but\ndeny that this leads to a paradoxical conclusion. In this section, we\nshall focus on this strategy.\n\nThe proponent of the sceptical solution can be understood as rejecting\neliminativism about our practices of ascribing meaning. Mirroring\nparallel discussions in metaethics, the two most obvious paths\navailable to her involve providing either an error-theoretic account\nor a non-factualist account of ascriptions of meaning. We shall follow\nBoghossian in viewing these paths as forms of irrealism about\nmeaning, content and rules (Boghossian 1989, 1990). A prominent\ngeneral line of argument in the recent literature suggests that\nirrealist views of any area make presuppositions that irrealist views\nof meaning and content are bound to deny, so that irrealism about\nmeaning and content is ultimately incoherent (Boghossian 1989, 1990;\nHattiangadi 2007, 2017, 2018; Miller 2011, 2015a, 2020). We\u2019ll\nillustrate this general line of attack by sketching an argument to the\neffect that, regardless of whether one pursues an error-theoretic or a\nnon-factualist approach, adopting irrealism leads inexorably to an\n\u201cinsane and intolerable\u201d and \u201cincredible and\nself-defeating\u201d form of eliminativism on which the\nnotions of meaning and content do turn out to \u201cvanish into thin\nair\u201d. We\u2019ll then briefly consider an alternative way of\nproviding a sceptical response, which aims to revise the conception of\nmeaning fact that is at work in the sceptic\u2019s mindset.\n",
