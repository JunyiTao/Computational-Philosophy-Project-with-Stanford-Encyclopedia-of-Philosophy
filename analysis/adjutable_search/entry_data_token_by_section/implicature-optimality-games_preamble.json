    "main_text": "\n\nLinguistic pragmatics studies the context-dependent use and\ninterpretation of expressions. Perhaps the most important notion in\npragmatics is Grice\u2019s (1967) conversational\nimplicature. It is based on the insight that by means of general\nprinciples of rational cooperative behavior we can communicate more\nwith the use of a sentence than the conventional semantic\nmeaning associated with it. Grice has argued, for instance, that\nthe exclusive interpretation of \u2018or\u2019\u2014according to\nwhich we infer from \u2018John or Mary came\u2019 that John and Mary\ndidn\u2019t come both\u2014is not due to the semantic meaning of\n\u2018or\u2019 but should be accounted for by a theory of\nconversational implicature. In this particular example,\u2014a\ntypical example of a so-called Quantity implicature\u2014the\nhearer\u2019s implication is taken to follow from the fact that the\nspeaker could have used a contrasting, and informatively stronger\nexpression, but chose not to. Other implicatures may follow from what\nthe hearer thinks that the speaker takes to be normal states of\naffairs, i.e., stereotypical interpretations. For both types of\nimplicatures, the hearer\u2019s (pragmatic) interpretation of an\nexpression involves what he takes to be the speaker\u2019s reason for\nusing this expression. But obviously, this speaker\u2019s reason must\ninvolve assumptions about the hearer\u2019s reasoning as well.\n\nIn this entry we will discuss formal accounts of conversational\nimplicatures that explicitly take into account the interactive\nreasoning of speaker and hearer (e.g., what speaker and hearer believe\nabout each other, the relevant aspects of the context of utterance\netc.) and that aim to reductively explain conversational implicature\nas the result of goal-oriented, economically optimised language use.\nFor this entry, just as in traditional analyses of implicatures, we\nwill assume that sentences have a pre-existing semantic meaning and\nwill mostly focus on generalised conversational implicatures.\n",
