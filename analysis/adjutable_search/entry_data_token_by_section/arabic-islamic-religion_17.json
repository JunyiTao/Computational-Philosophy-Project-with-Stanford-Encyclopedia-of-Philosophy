Ethics in Islam\n\nIn addition to the role of reason in justifying specific ethical\njudgments like what is morally right and wrong (al-\u1e25usn\nwa-l-qub\u1e25)\u2014a discussion that mirrors those about\nreason and faith in Islam more generally\n (\u00a71.2)\u2014Muslim\n thinkers also were concerned with the ontological status of normative\nproperties, like goodness and badness (see Emon 2010). With respect to\nthis issue, one asks whether ethical facts exist independently of God\nor do they originate from and have their morally binding force as a\nresult of a divine command. On the one hand, if the demands of morally\ngood and bad actions are independent of God, then is God subject to\nthose demands or not? If so, then does God observe them as a matter of\nnecessity, in which case God\u2019s power seems limited, or does he\nobserve them as a matter of will or choice, in which case were he not\nto observe them would he be morally bad, since again these demands\ndetermine morally good and bad actions? On the other hand, if ethical\ndicta have their source and force in God\u2019s commanding them,\ncould God have commanded contrary to what he did and so invert right\nand wrong? For example, could God have commanded us to lie, in which\ncase lying would have been obligatory and even morally good?\n",
