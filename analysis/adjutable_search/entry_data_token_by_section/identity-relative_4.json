    "main_text": "Paradoxes of Identity || The Paradox of 101 Dalmatians\n2.3 The Paradox of 101 Dalmatians\n\n(This paradox is also known as the paradox of 1001 cats; Geach 1980,\nLewis 1993.) Focus on Oscar and Oscar\u2212 at\n\\(t\\)\u2014before Oscar loses his tail. Is Oscar\u2212 a\ndog? When Oscar loses his tail the resulting creature is certainly a\ndog. Why then should we deny that Oscar\u2212 is a dog? We\nsaw above that one possible response to Chrysippus\u2019 paradox was\nto claim that Oscar\u2212 does not exist from \\(t'\\) on.\nBut even if we adopt this view, how does it follow that\nOscar\u2212, existing as it does at \\(t\\), is not a dog?\nYet if Oscar\u2212 is a dog, then, given the standard\naccount of identity, there are two dogs where we would normally count\nonly one. In fact, for each of Oscar\u2019s hairs, of which there are\nat least 101, there is a proper part of Oscar\u2014Oscar minus a\nhair\u2014which is just as much a dog as Oscar\u2212.\nThere are then at least 101 dogs (and in fact many more) where we\nwould count only one. Some claim that things such as dogs are\n\u201cmaximal\u201d. No proper part of a dog is a dog (Burke 1993).\nOne might conclude as much simply to avoid multiplying the number of\ndogs populating the space reserved for Oscar alone. But the maximality\nprinciple may seem to be independently justified as well. When Oscar\nbarks, do all these different dogs bark in unison? If a thing is a\ndog, shouldn\u2019t it be capable of independent action? Yet\nOscar\u2212 cannot act independently of Oscar.\nNevertheless, David Lewis (1993) has suggested a reason for counting\nOscar\u2212 and all the 101 dog parts that differ (in\nvarious different ways) from one another and Oscar by a hair, as dogs,\nand in fact as Dalmatians (Oscar is a Dalmatian). Lewis invokes\nUnger\u2019s (1980) \u201cproblem of the many\u201d. Oscar sheds\ncontinuously but gradually. His hairs loosen and then dislodge, some\nsuch remaining still in place. Hence, within Oscar\u2019s compass at\nany given time there are congeries of Dalmatian parts sooner or later\nto become definitely Dalmatians; some in a day, some in a second, or a\nsplit second. It seems arbitrary to proclaim a Dalmatian part that is\na split second away from becoming definitely a Dalmatian, a Dalmatian,\nwhile denying that one a day away is a Dalmatian. As Lewis puts it, we\nmust either deny that the \u201cmany\u201d are Dalmatians, or we\nmust deny that the Dalmatians are many. Lewis endorses proposals of\nboth types but seems to favor one of the latter type according to\nwhich the Dalmatians are not many but rather \u201calmost one\u201d.\nIn any case, the standard account of identity seems unable on its own\nto handle the paradox of 101 Dalmatians. It requires that we either\ndeny that Oscar minus a hair is a dog\u2014and a Dalmatian\u2014or\nelse that we must affirm that there is a multiplicity of Dalmatians,\nall but one of which is incapable of independent action and all of\nwhich bark in unison no more loudly than Oscar barks alone.\n",
