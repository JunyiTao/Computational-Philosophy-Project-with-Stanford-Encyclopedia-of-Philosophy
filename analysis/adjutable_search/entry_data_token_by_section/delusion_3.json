    "main_text": "The Philosophical Significance of Delusion || Moral psychology and neuroethics\n1.3 Moral psychology and neuroethics\n\nMoral psychology and neuroethics investigate the implications of the\ndebates on the nature of delusions for the way in which our rights and\nresponsibilities are affected by having delusions. Does having delusions undermine our capacity to consent to treatment or to participate in decision making? \n\nIt is also important to understand whether we can be regarded as\nmorally responsible for our actions if we engage in morally\nproblematic behaviour or commit acts of violence or other crimes that\nare motivated by our delusions. As a\nconsequence of the failures of rationality and self knowledge that\ncharacterize some delusions, we\nmay appear as if we are \u2018in two minds\u2019, and we may not\nalways present ourselves as unified agents with a coherent set of\nbeliefs and preferences (e.g., Kennett and Matthews 2009). As a\nresult, we may be judged to be (locally or temporally) unable to\nexercise our capacity for autonomous thought and action. \n\nAnother important question concerns the possibility that we are\nvulnerable to epistemic injustice when we report unusual beliefs that\nare regarded as delusional and symptomatic of mental distress.\nEpistemic injustice occurs when our contribution to\nknowledge is dismissed due to negative stereotypes associated with\naspects of our identity (e.g., \u201cWomen are bad at maths\u201d\nor \u201cBlack people have lower IQ than white people\u201d). In the case of\ndelusions, a risk is that other people come to dismiss our\ncontribution to a conversation or come to consider us as lacking\nauthority or credibility based on the fact that some of our beliefs\nare delusional (Sanati and Kyratsous 2015). But the presence of\ndelusions does not necessarily speak against our overall capacity\nto produce and share knowledge, so dismissing our contribution due to\nour having some delusional beliefs may be unfair.\n",
