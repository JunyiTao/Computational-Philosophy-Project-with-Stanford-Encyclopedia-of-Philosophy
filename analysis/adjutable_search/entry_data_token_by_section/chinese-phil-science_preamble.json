    "main_text": "\n\n\nAt first glance, there may appear to be little connection between\nChinese philosophy and science. Stereotypes of Chinese philosophy as\nconsisting almost entirely of Confucianism and claims that Confucians\nwere not interested in science add to this perception.\n\nFor example, in a recent correspondence in the journal\nNature, Peng Gong, a research scientist at Tsinghua University\nand the University of California, Berkeley gives the following harsh\nassessment of the effect of Chinese philosophy on the development of\nscience in China:\n\nTwo cultural genes have passed through generations of Chinese\nintellectuals for more than 2,000 years. The first is the thoughts of\nConfucius, who proposed that intellectuals should become loyal\nadministrators. The second is the writings of Zhuang Zhou, who said\nthat a harmonious society would come from isolating families so as to\navoid exchange and conflict, and by shunning technology to avoid greed.\nTogether, these cultures have encouraged small-scale and\nself-sufficient practices in Chinese society, but discouraged\ncuriosity, commercialization and technology. They helped to produce a\nscientific void in Chinese society that persisted for millennia. And\nthey continue to be relevant today (Gong 2012).\n\nIs this a fair account? Is Chinese philosophy in some sense\nanti-science? Does it contribute to science in ways that constitute a\n\u201cChinese science\u201d that is different from modern\nscience. Or is the history of science in China part of a\nuniversal science?\n\nThis essay addresses relations between science and Chinese\nphilosophy in several ways. It begins with a detailed argument by the\ninfluential historian of Chinese philosophy Fung Yu-lan almost one\nhundred years ago, claiming that there is no science in China because\nthere is no need for any. The second section presents an opposing\nview from the history of science as presented by Joseph Needham and\nothers, introducing a range of sciences that developed in China, with\nwhat might be called distinctive Chinese characteristics. The\nthird section addresses the particular problem of Needham's\nrepresentation of Chinese science as significantly Daoist.\n\n\nThe next two sections attempt to historicize and reconcile these two\nhistories, one philosophical and one scientific, by turning to the\nintellectual and social contexts for the development of science in\nChina. The fourth section focuses on concepts shared by the\npractitioners and texts of early philosophy and science. The\nfifth section turns to an intellectual divergence between generalist\nand technical specialist knowledge through the categorization of texts\nin a chapter of the dynastic history of the Han dynasty (Han\nshu). The sixth section takes up the social context of the\npractitioners of the early sciences and their relations to\nphilosophical texts and traditions. The last section surveys the\nearly sciences, with specific interest in areas of close relationship\nbetween the sciences and Chinese philosophy, especially in the areas of\ncosmology, astronomy, mathematics and medicine.\n",
