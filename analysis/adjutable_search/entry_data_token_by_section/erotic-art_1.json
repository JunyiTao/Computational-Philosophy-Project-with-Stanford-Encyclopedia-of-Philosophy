    "main_text": "What is Erotic Art? || Some Further Distinctions\n1.2 Some Further Distinctions\n\nLevinson (2005) makes a useful distinction between erotic art and what\nhe calls erotica, that is, images intended to sexually\nstimulate but not to reward artistic interest (such as provocative\nlingerie ads). In general, it is good to keep in mind that the domain\nof erotic art only constitutes a small subsection of the much larger\nclass of items that are called erotic (erotic massages, erotic games,\nerotic toys, etc.). Erotic art also seems to fall within the broader\ncategory of sexually themed art. All works of erotic art have\na sexual theme, it could be argued, but not the other way around: many\nartworks with a sexual theme are not works of erotic art. Ian\nMcEwan\u2019s On Chesil Beach has already been mentioned.\nAnother example might be Tracey Emin\u2019s Is\nAnal Sex Legal? (1998), which simply consists of that\nquestion writ large in pink neon light. (The piece is usually\nexhibited together with its complement, Is Legal\nSex Anal? also from 1998).\n\nSexually themed art should be distinguished from sexually\nstimulating art, i.e., art that stimulates its target audience\nsexually, even though it may not have had the aim to do so. While some\nmay find it difficult to think of any examples in this category,\nSircello argues on phenomenological grounds that everything that is\ntruly beautiful, and hence every work of art that is truly beautiful,\nwill be experienced as sexually titillating. For instance, when he\nstudies The Burghers of Calais, with\nits stooped and despondent old men,\n\n\nthe beauty of Rodin\u2019s restless surface leads me \u2026 to rub\nthat glorious bronze, and once again comes that warmth in the\ntesticles, that stirring in the penis, that itch in the nipples and\nthe tongue. (1979: 225)\n\n\nSimilarly,\n\n\nwhen I inspect the austere and meticulous Zurbaran still life, notice\nthe painstaking precision of its details \u2026 (I) feel forthwith\nthose stirrings in the groin. (1979: 225)\n\n\nHowever, while Sircello judges his arousal to be \u201cneither\nabnormal nor idiosyncratic\u201d and to be fully \u201cappropriate\nand natural\u201d (1979: 226) not everyone might agree with that\nassessment.\n\nThe counterpart of sexually stimulating art is failed erotic\nart (or as Levinson 2006 would have it \u201cnominally erotic\nart\u201d): art that aims but does not succeed in stimulating its\ntarget audience sexually (see also Mag Uidhir 2010). Anti-erotic\nart, on the other hand, is art that aims to induce\nnegative sexual feelings, thoughts, and imaginings in its\ntarget audience. Otto Dix\u2019s Old\nCouple (1923) or George Grosz\u2019s\nSex Murder in the Ackerstrasse (1916\u20137) could\nserve as illustrations. More recently, feminist artists such as Kiki\nSmith have explored the dark, violent, abject aspects of sexuality in\ntheir work (see, for instance, Smith\u2019s\nTale, 1992, and Blood Pool,\n1992).\n\nFinally, because censorship and moral policing have often prevented\nartists from making work that is openly erotic, it is worth drawing\nattention to the existence of covertly erotic art, that is,\nart made with the covert intention to stimulate its target\naudience sexually and that succeeds to some extent in doing so. A good\nexample are the so called \u201csukashi shunga\u201d (hidden shunga)\nthat were popular in Japan at the beginning of the 20th\ncentury. Shunga are woodblock prints, often created by Japan\u2019s\nleading artists, depicting highly erotic scenes. While there were\nalready regulations in the early 18th century against the\ndistribution of shunga, it was only at the end of the 19th\ncentury, in the wake of Japan\u2019s increasing openness towards the\nWest, that censorship laws were really being enforced. As a result,\nhidden (see-through) shunga prints were designed to escape the strict\neye of the censor. What at first sight appear to be beautifully drawn\npostcards depicting landscapes with some space in the middle and at\nthe corners to write one\u2019s message, when held up to the light,\nturn out to be sexually explicit lovemaking scenes (Aki 2013: 47). An\nexample of an entirely different kind might be Maria Scanu\u2019s\nsculpture of Madonna del Naviganti (1999) or Vermeer\u2019s\nMilk Maid (1657\u201358).\nGiven that milk maids had a reputation for sexual availability in 17th\ncentury Holland, some scholars have argued that the painting has a\ncovert erotic message, with the foot warmer on the floor suggesting\nfeminine desire (because foot warmers would heat not only the feet but\neverything under a woman\u2019s skirt) and one of the Delft tiles in\nthe scene depicting Cupid, while another tile shows a traveling man\npossibly suggesting that the maid is thinking of an absent lover\n(Liedtke 2009).\n",
