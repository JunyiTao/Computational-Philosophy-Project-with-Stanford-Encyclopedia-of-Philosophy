    "main_text": "The Bible || Obedience to the Powers That Be\n2.1 Obedience to the Powers That Be\n\nPolitical ideas conveyed by the Bible include the following:\n\n\n\nThe human race is normally ruled by kings or emperors. There are very\nfew traces of republican institutions in the Bible. (There is one\nexception:\n 1 Machabees 8:14\u201316\n is an admiring description of Roman republican government.)\n\n\nKings are very often wicked tyrants and enemies of God. The peoples\noften share the vices of their rulers.\n\n\nThe kingship of King David is a model (though David also often\nsinned).\n\n\nSubjects must obey rulers, even the wicked. It is wrong to rebel, and\nespecially to make any attack on the person of the ruler\u2014see\n 2 Samuel 1:14\u201316.\n\n\nBut obedience to rulers is always limited by obedience to the commands\nof God.\n\n\nThe New Testament writers teach that Christians must obey their\nrulers: \n\n\nLet every soul be subject to higher powers: for there is no power but\nfrom God: and those that are, are ordained of God. Therefore he that\nresisteth the power, resisteth the ordinance of God. And they that\nresist, purchase to themselves damnation. \u2026 For he is\nGod\u2019s minister to thee, for good. But if thou do that which is\nevil, fear: for he beareth not the sword in vain. For he is\nGod\u2019s minister: an avenger to execute wrath upon him that doth\nevil. Wherefore be subject of necessity, not only for wrath, but also\nfor conscience\u2019 sake.\n (Romans 13:1\u20135)\n \n\nBe ye subject therefore to every human creature for God\u2019s sake:\nwhether it be to the king as excelling; or to governors as sent by him\n\u2026 For so is the will of God.\n (1 Peter 2:13\u201315)\n \n\n\nIn the seventeenth century most Protestants and some Catholics\ninferred from these texts that subjects always have a religious duty\nto obey their rulers, reconciling this with the text \u201cWe ought\nto obey God, rather than men\u201d\n (Acts 5:29)\n by means of a doctrine of \u201cpassive\n obedience\u201d.[5]\n Some of the Fathers and the Carolingian writers held a similar\nposition, but most scholastic authors, under the influence of ideas\ndrawn partly from Aristotle and partly from the law texts, held that\nunder some circumstances disobedience and rebellion may be\njustified.\n",
