Racial profiling in the legal system was one\nsuch concern: if people belonging to particular racial and ethnic\ngroups are more likely to be arrested, charged, or convicted of a\ncriminal offense, they are more likely to be required to provide DNA\nsamples to forensic databases, and therefore more likely to come back\ninto the system with future offenses (Kitcher 1996). Another concern\nwas that if genetic discrimination by insurers and employers creates a\n\u201cgenetic underclass\u201d (Lee 1993; Nelkin and Tancredi 1989),\nthen to the extent that race and ethnicity correlate with\nsocioeconomic status, some groups\u2014already affected by\ndisparities in health outcomes unrelated to genetic\ndifferences\u2014will be disproportionately represented among this\n\u201cgenetic underclass.\u201d A further concern was the social\nstakes involved when group-based differences are identified, whether\nthese involve sequences localized to particular groups or varying in\nfrequency among groups (Lapp\u00e9 1994). And given the history of\nusing biological explanations to provide ideological justification for\nsocial inequalities associated with oppressive power structures, the\nprospective use of molecular genetics to explain race differences was\nmet with caution (Hubbard 1994). These concerns were dismissed by HGP\nproponents, who argued that mapping and sequencing the human genome\ncelebrate our common humanity. At the June 26, 2000 White House press\nconference announcing completion of \u201ca working draft\u201d of\nthe sequence of the human genome, Venter announced that the results\nshow that \u201cthe concept of race has no genetic or scientific\nbasis\u201d (see Clinton, et al. 2000).\n\nPost-HGP genetics and genomics have not lived up to the mantra that\nbecause we are 99.9 percent the same, there is no such thing as race.\nIndeed, a predominantly African American racial identity has been\nascribed to the human genome reference sequence itself (Reich et al.\n2009), and the de novo assembly of genomes permitted by long\nread sequencing has led to several countries, such as China, Korea,\nand Denmark, producing their own \u201cethnicity-specific reference\ngenomes\u201d (Kowal and Llamas 2019). The International HapMap\nProject, which was initiated in 2002 with the goal of compiling a\nhaplotype map adequately dense with SNP markers to permit the\nidentification of genes implicated in common diseases and drug\nresponses, sampled the DNA of four populations (European-Americans in\nUtah; Yoruba in Ibadan, Nigeria; Japanese in Tokyo; and Han Chinese in\nBeijing). This reproduction of racial categories (here, European,\nAfrican, and Asian) at the level of the genome has been characterized\nas the \u201cmolecular reinscription of race\u201d (Duster 2015).\nDTC ancestry testing appeals to a range of group categories, which are\ndefined by geography, nationality, ethnicity, and race: Ancestry.com\nadvertises tests for Irish ancestry in early March each year;\nFamilyTreeDNA confirms Jewish ancestry, whether Ashkenazi or Sephardi;\nAfrican Ancestry, Inc. finds ancestral ties to present-day African\ncountries and ethnic groups dating back more than 500 years; and\nDNAPrint\u2019s panels of ancestry informative markers determine\nproportions of (Indo)European, East Asian, sub-Saharan African, and\nNative American heritage.\n\nThe resurgence in biological thinking about race and ethnicity since\nthe HGP is due in large part to the postgenomic use of racial and\nethnic categories of difference to try to capture patterns of group\ngenetic differences in various fields of research. The revolutionary\nbenefits of postgenomic \u201cpersonalized\u201d or\n\u201cprecision\u201d medicine were supposed to focus on individual\ngenetic differences within populations, not group genetic differences\nacross populations. Pharmaceuticals, a powerful engine driving\npost-HGP research into human genetic differences, were supposed to be\ntailored to individual genomes. In 2003, Venter opposed the U.S. Food\nand Drug Administration (FDA) proposal to carry out pharmaceutical\ntesting using the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) racial and\nethnic classification system, arguing that these are\n\u201csocial\u201d not \u201cscientific\u201d categories of race\nand ethnicity and that the promise of pharmacogenetics lies in its\nimplementation as individualized medicine given the likelihood that\nvariation in drug responses will vary more within racial and ethnic\ngroups than among them (Haga and Venter 2003). However, en route to a\n\u201cpersonalized\u201d or \u201cprecision\u201d medicine based\non individual genetic differences and pharmaceuticals tailored to\nindividual genomes, a detour via research into group genetic\ndifferences has been taken. Now that group genetic differences have\nbecome of interest to more than just evolutionary biologists and\npopulation geneticists, impetus is provided to debates to which\nphilosophers of science have contributed: longstanding debates about\nwhether race is biologically real or socially constructed (Andreasen\n2000; Pigliucci and Kaplan 2003; Gannett 2010; Hochman 2013; Spencer\n2014) and more recent ones concerning the appropriateness of the use\nof racial categories in biomedical research (Root 2003; Gannett 2005;\nKaplan 2010; Hardimon 2013).\n\nDespite the detour via group genetic differences en route to\n\u201cpersonalized\u201d or \u201cprecision\u201d medicine,\ngenome-based research into common diseases and drug responses has\nfocused predominantly on Europeans. For GWAS, a 2009 analysis showed\nthat 96 percent of participants were of European descent; by 2016,\nthough the proportion of participants of European descent had\ndecreased to 81 percent, the change was mostly accounted for by a\ngreater number of studies being carried out in Asian countries\n(Popejoy and Fullerton 2016). Even though African populations are the\nmost genetically diverse in the world, by 2018, only 2 percent of GWAS\nparticipants had been African in origin (Sirugo et al. 2019). This\nEuropean bias makes it more difficult to isolate rare genetic variants\ncontributing to disease, to provide accurate and informative genetic\ntest results to nonEuropeans, and to ensure that any clinical benefits\nthat arise from genomic research will be equitably distributed within\nthe U.S. and globally. Sociologist Dorothy E. Roberts (2021) calls for\ngenetic researchers to \u201cstop using a white, European standard\nfor human genetics and instead study a fuller range of human genetic\nvariation,\u201d which will \u201cgive scientists a richer resource\nto understand human biology\u201d as well as promoting equitable\naccess to the benefits of research. That study of human genetic\nvariation, Roberts argues, should abandon use of race \u201cas a\nbiological variable that can explain differences in health, disease,\nor responses to therapies,\u201d as it obscures \u201chow structural\nracism has biological effects and produces health disparities in\nracialized populations\u201d (p. 566). Structural racism is advanced\nas a key determinant of population health: for example, the racial and\neconomic segregation of neighborhoods contributes to health\ndisparities because of differences in quality of housing, exposure to\npollutants and toxins, good education and employment opportunities,\nand access to decent health care (Bailey et al. 2017).\n\nThe NHGRI has affirmed its commitment to improve the inclusion of\nparticipants from diverse populations in research and begun to\nappreciate that genomic studies are designed in ways that fail to\nconsider the contribution of social and physical environments to\ndisease (Hindorff et al. 2018). However, as sociologist Steven Epstein\n(2007) has argued more generally, the \u201cinclusion-and-difference\nparadigm\u201d that has prevailed in U.S. research over the past\ncouple of decades, though correcting researchers\u2019 previously\nheld default assumption of the white, middle-aged, white male as the\nnormative standard, serves to amplify the role of biology in health\nand disease while drawing attention away from society. Genome\nscientists understand the ramifications attached to their use of\nracial and ethnic categories in research, and despite longstanding,\nwell-considered ELSI-funded research that urges care be attached to\nthe use of these categories (Sankar and Cho 2002; Sankar et al. 2007),\nproblems are ongoing and attended to by NHGRI leaders concerned about\n\u201cthe misuse of social categories of race and ethnicity as a\nproxy for genomic variation\u201d (Bonham et al. 2018, p. 1534). The\n\u201cweaponization\u201d of genomics by White nationalists and the\nalt-right has raised the stakes for genome scientists. The\nself-described fascist, White supremacist, racist, and anti-Semite who\nmurdered 10 African Americans at a Buffalo supermarket in 2022 posted\nwritings that cited dozens of scientific studies, including use of a\nGWAS of educational attainment to support hereditarian views of racial\ndifferences in intelligence and use of a principal components analysis\n(PCA) that resolved human genetic diversity into continental-level\nclusters to support realism about biological race (Carlson 2022).\n\nWhite supremacists chug milk to celebrate their origins in European\npopulations that evolved the ability to digest lactose in adulthood\n(Harmon 2018), and they appeal to traces of Neanderthal DNA in their\ngenomes to celebrate their origins in populations that evolved outside\nAfrica (Wolinsky 2019). While it seems incumbent on genome scientists\nto confront racist misuses of their research, they face challenges in\ndoing so. Misuse may result from misunderstanding science, but not\nalways: lay experts among White nationalists capably use cutting-edge\ngenomics research to justify hereditarian views, thereby building a\ncounter-knowledge (Doron, in press) or citizen science of sorts\n(Panofsky and Donovan 2019). In the U.S., White nationalists take DTC\nancestry tests to prove their genetic purity, that they are 100%\nEuropean/White/non-Jewish (Panofsky and Donovan 2019), while in\nEurope, this assumed homogeneity of Whiteness comes into question with\nNordicists and Mediterraneans using genetic admixture mapping as they\nvie to prove themselves the most European of Europeans (Doron, in\npress). When scientists engage with racists, even ones who are\nscientifically literate, there is the risk of unintentionally helping\ntheir cause. \u201cFurthermore,\u201d as Aaron Panofsky et al.\n(2021) argue, \u201cmany of the findings about human evolution and\nvariation are genuinely complex, ambiguous, contested, changing, and\ninvolve historically contingent judgments\u201d (p. 396); hence, it\nmay be difficult to claim that research has been misconstrued. As\nClaude-Olivier Doron notes, insofar as lay experts exploit ambiguities\nconstitutive of scientific discourse in population genetics as they\ntransfer scientific findings to a White supremacist ideological\nframework, these findings operate within the framework without\ndistortion.\n\nGenome scientists have made recommendations about sampling protocols\nand standards for visualizations in population genomics to discourage\nthe misappropriation of research by racists who draw conclusions\ninconsistent with the intentions of scientists (Carlson et al. 2022).\nHowever, these recommendations portray population genetic structure,\nunlike race, as wholly biological, and as science studies scholarship\nsuggests, the challenge of accessing the biological without recourse\nto the social\u2014and the interests, biases, and imaginaries\nassociated with the social\u2014may be impossible to overcome.\nHistorians, sociologists, and anthropologists of science have\ninsightfully documented how social, political, and cultural\nconstructions of identity are incorporated in, and become defined by,\ngenetics and genomics research in ways specific to their locations:\nreenactment of continentally-defined races as biogeographical ancestry\nin the U.S. (Fullwiley 2008; Gannett 2014); influence of population\ngenetics on Irish origin stories and genealogy of the Irish Travellers\n(Nash 2008; Nash 2017); naturalization and even pathologization of\ncaste and regional differences in India (Egorova 2010);\ngeneticization/genomicization of Mestizo identity in the context of\nMexico\u2019s own genome mapping project (L\u00f3pez Beltr\u00e1n\n2011); post-apartheid South Africa\u2019s \u201cgenomic\narchive\u201d bound to apartheid\u2019s racialized subjectivities\ndespite advancing nonracial unity through common origins (Schramm\n2021); genetic ancestry testing as a basis for Jewishness (El-Haj\n2012); Native American DNA as proof of tribal identity (TallBear\n2013); and nationalism\u2019s role in interpreting differences\nbetween the Korean Reference Genome (KOREF) and HGP\u2019s genome\nreference sequence as occurring at the population rather than\nindividual level (Kowal and Llamas 2019).\n\nUse of \u201cancestry\u201d as a category for genetics and genomics\nresearch is considered a means of averting problems associated with\nthe use of \u201crace\u201d and \u201cethnicity\u201d; for\nexample, for the mapping of complex traits, rather than relying on\nself-identified race, it has been recommended that population\nstructure be assessed empirically by genotyping individuals to\ndetermine their \u201ccontinental ancestry\u201d proportions\n(Shields et al. 2005). Critics contend, however, that\n\u201ccontinental ancestry\u201d belies the continuous pattern with\nwhich genetic variation is distributed across the species and reenacts\nrace as it has been traditionally defined, thus contributing to its\nreification (Fullwiley 2008; Gannett 2014; Lewis et al. 2022). In\n2023, the National Academy of Sciences published a Consensus Study\nReport, \u201cUsing Population Descriptors in Genetics and Genomics\nResearch: A New Framework for an Evolving Field,\u201d in response to\na request by the National Institutes of Health to assess the status of\nuse of race, ethnicity, ancestry, and other population descriptors.\nThe report recommends against use of racial labels in genetics and\ngenomics research, a possible exception being studies of health\ndisparities with genomic data, in which race serves as a proxy for\nenvironmental variables (e.g., racism). A distinction is drawn between\ngenetic ancestry (paths through which an individual\u2019s DNA is\ninherited from specific ancestors, known as the \u201cancestral\nrecombination graph\u201d) and genetic similarity (a quantitative\nmeasure of genetic resemblance among individuals that reflects shared\ngenetic ancestry). The report recognizes geographic origins,\nethnicity, and genetic ancestry as appropriate categories for\nreconstructing human evolutionary history, but advocates use of\ngenetic similarity to constitute groups in most other research\ncontexts, including gene discovery for complex traits.\n\nRelying on genetic similarity does not necessarily lead researchers\naway from race, ethnicity, and ancestry. In an ethnographic study,\nsociologists Joan H. Fujimura and Ramya Rajagopalan (2011) found that\nalthough the statistical machinery associated with GWAS allows\nresearchers to avoid race and ethnic categories by analyzing samples\nbased wholly on genetic similarity, there was \u201cslippage\u201d\nfrom genetic similarity to shared ancestry, which, in turn, since\nmediated by geography and genealogy, became interpreted as racial or\nethnic. While ancestral recombination graphs situate individuals in\nthe context of their genealogical relations without assigning them to\ngeographically or culturally defined populations or groups, in\npractice, these categories are almost always incorporated in genetic\nancestry estimation (Lewis et al. 2022). Population geneticist Graham\nCoop (2022) favours replacing genetic ancestry with genetic\nsimilarity, arguing that describing a sampled individual\u2019s\ngenetic similarity to a reference panel (e.g., \u201cX is\ngenetically similar to the GBR 1000 Genome samples\u201d) is\npreferable to attributing genetic ancestry to that individual (e.g.,\n\u201cX has Northwestern European genetic ancestry\u201d),\nas it recognizes the conventionalism of the reference panel and\ncontinuity of genetic variation (pp. 11\u201312). However, given that the\n1000 Genomes Project\u2019s 26 populations across five continental\nregions are named using language that reflects \u201cboth the\nancestral geography or ethnicity of each population and the geographic\nlocation where the samples from that population were collected\u201d\n(Coriell Institute)\u2014e.g., \u201cBritish from England and\nScotland\u201d\u2014the slippage remarked upon by Fujimura and\nRajagopalan is encouraged. Nevertheless, as sociologists Aaron\nPanofsky and Catherine Bliss (2017) observe, \u201cGeneticists face a\ncomplex set of pressures regarding population labeling\u201d (p. 75).\nAmbiguous labels for populations that conflate geography, race, and\nethnicity may offer geneticists the flexibility to fulfill their own\nresearch goals while accessing repositories of preclassified\nbiospecimens and data, collaborating with researchers pursuing quite\ndifferent agendas, and maintaining goodwill with populations studied.\nThese pressures compete with pressures about labels imposed by funders\nand journals, which may provoke skepticism and resistance.\n",
