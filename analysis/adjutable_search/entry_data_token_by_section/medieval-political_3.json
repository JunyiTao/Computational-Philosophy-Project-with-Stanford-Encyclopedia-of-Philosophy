    "main_text": "The Bible || Slavery\n2.2 Slavery\n\nNew Testament writers say that whether a Christian is slave or free is\na matter indifferent: \n\n\nLet every man abide in the same calling in which he was called. Wast\nthou called, being a bondman? care not for it \u2026 For he that is\ncalled in the Lord, being a bondman, is the freeman of the Lord.\nLikewise he that is called, being free, is the bondman of Christ.\n (1 Corinthians 7:20\u201322)\n\nThere is neither Jew nor Greek: there is neither bond nor free: there\nis neither male nor female. For you are all one in Christ Jesus.\n (Galatians 3:28)\n \n\n\nThe ancient Cynics and\n Stoics\n also held that a slave may attain virtue and happiness, since the\nessential freedom of a human being is not incompatible with external\nconstraint.\n\nSince being a slave is a matter indifferent, Christianity did not\ncondemn slavery. Several New Testament texts exhort slaves to\nobedience (the Vulgate servi, which is normally and properly\ntranslated \u201cslaves\u201d, is in the Douai version translated\n\u201cservants\u201d): \n\n\nServants, be subject to your masters with all fear, not only to the\ngood and gentle, but also to the froward.\n (1 Peter 2:18)\n\nServants, be obedient to them that are your lords according to the\nflesh, with fear and trembling, in the simplicity of your heart, as to\nChrist.\n (Ephesians 6:5;\n cf.\n Colossians 3:22)\n \n\n\nPaul wrote a letter to the Christian slave owner, Philemon, exhorting\nhim to treat well a fugitive slave \u201cwhom I have sent back to\nthee\u201d\n (Philemon 1:12).\n",
