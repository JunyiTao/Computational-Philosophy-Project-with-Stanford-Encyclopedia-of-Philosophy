    "main_text": "Cosmology\n6. Cosmology\nIn his 1916 Kosmogonie, Ehrenfels aims at laying out the\nfundamental Gestalt of the world as a whole. Ehrenfels wants to\nelucidate the origin, development, and ultimate destiny of the\nuniverse. On the one hand, he considers it as a Kosmos in the\nclassical sense of an ordered, harmonious whole, governed by an\nordering principle that establishes the wholeness and unity of the\nworld. However, Ehrenfels also acknowledges a principle of disunity\nand entropy: chaos and chance. For Ehrenfels, the world as we know it\nis generated through the complementary activity of these two cosmic\nprinciples (compare PSII, 44 ff.; Valent 2016, 195; H\u00f6fer 2017,\n46; Ierna 2017b, \u00a73).\nThis results in a religious dualism. The contraposition of chaos and\ncosmos explains the presence of both good and evil, reason and chance,\netc. in the world, allowing Ehrenfels to provide a theodicy.\nNevertheless, the cosmic principles themselves cannot be\nstraightforwardly regarded as absolutely good or evil. Moreover,\nalthough Ehrenfels calls the ordering principle \u201cGod\u201d, it\ncannot be understood as the omnipotent creator of western monotheism\n(also dubbed \u201csolotheism\u201d by Ehrenfels), since neither\ncosmic principle is absolute in itself. Creation can only be achieved\nby both principles working in tandem and consists in God ordering and\n\u201cshaping\u201d or \u201cforming\u201d\n(\u201cGestalten\u201d in its verbal form) the world in\nperpetual contrast with chaos. Hence, the Kosmogonie does not\ncarry the tone of a typically Christian religious work, nor is it\nsimply a transposition of ancient or eastern mythologies into modern\nEurope. Rather, Ehrenfels had the ambition to formulate a general\nframework for a (utopian) future world-spanning religion, based on a\nfirm scientific foundation (Ehrenfels 1916, 150, also see PSII,\n52). Indeed, Ehrenfels presents his dualism explicitly as a scientific\nhypothesis to be investigated and proven, and concludes that it can in\nfact explain the world as it is and can be confirmed by experience\n(Ehrenfels 1916, 23, 35).\nIn the fourth paragraph of the sixth chapter, Ehrenfels formulates\nsix dogmas for his new religion: 1) The world is the combined product\nof the active principle of order and form\n(\u201cGestaltung\u201d) and the passive principle of chaos.\n2) The world has a beginning but no end. Order and form are eternally\nprogressing and increasing. 3) The principle of unity is bodiless and\nrather \u201csoul-like\u201d. 4) The eternal progress of the world\nproceeds from an eternal internal development in the principle of\nunity. 5) The world is not a result of a purposeful will, but of a\nblind forming (\u201cGestalten\u201d). 6) We human beings\nare part of the divine and hence collaborators in the divine works.\nThese last two points are particularly relevant, because Ehrenfels\nwill conclude the Kosmogonie with the admittedly\nunsubstantiated claim that the principle of unity and order is coming\nto self-awareness through the human mind and that it is in and through\nhuman beings that its blind creative impulse can acquire a purpose\n(Ehrenfels 1916, 86, 207).\nThe mere formulation of the six dogmas, as Ehrenfels clearly states\nat the end of the fourth paragraph of the sixth chapter, cannot have\nthe pretension to constitute without further ado a fully formed\nreligion. In his 1922 Gedanken \u00fcber die\nReligion der Zukunft, Ehrenfels then sketches in more detail what\nis still missing in the Kosmogonie. Here, as well as in the\nKosmogonie, he provides a description or morphology of\nreligion rather than a definition (in the Kosmogonie he spoke\nof a physiognomy as Weltbeschreibung). Religions in general\nconsist of four aspects:\n\na Weltanschauuung, an encompassing vision of the world\nbased on metaphysical assumptions, that address the \u201cbig\nquestions\u201d of why, whence, and whereto;\na Morallehre or moral standard that tells us which actions\nare good or evil, allowed or reprehensible;\na Kultus, or a system of traditional practices that allow\nthe faithful to relate to whichever powers of the cosmos they\nacknowledge;\nexemplary Idealgestalten, imaginary or historical figures\nto emulate, i.e., heroes and saints.\n\nHowever, Ehrenfels in this writing renounces\nthe soul-like nature of the divine and formulates a new theory of the\n\u201csuperposition of units of consciousness\u201d. Ehrenfels claims\nthat wherever there is a living cell, there we can speak of some form\nof \u201cconsciousness\u201d. This would hold not only for\nunicellular organisms, but also for plants, animals and humans. If\nevery living cell of my body is somehow conscious, then also the\nindividual cells in my brain must be. Yet while each and every\nindividual neuron is conscious in itself, collectively they also\nconstitute my unitary consciousness as a human being. This leads\nEhrenfels through analogy to formulate the idea of \u201cpersonalities\nof higher order\u201d, indeed a Volksseele would be more than\na mere poetic fiction. As support for this thesis Ehrenfels points to\norganic metaphors for social processes (such as competition for limited\nresources) as well as the purposeful unity displayed by bee swarms that\ncollectively act like a single organism. Similarly, a few years later\nin Die Religion der Zukunft, he also states explicitly that\nall intellects participate in the divine intellect (Ehrenfels 1929, in\nPSIV, 286).\nEhrenfels\u2019 thoughts and writings about cosmology and religion\ndidn\u2019t remain at the level of mere academic\n\u201carmchair\u201d speculations. Besides his engagement for sexual\nreform and the racial question in opinion pieces and speeches, he also\nactively sought to concretely establish the new religion sketched\nabove. Indeed, Ehrenfels went so far as to publicly appeal in an open\nletter to the president of Czechoslovakia, his former fellow\nBrentano-pupil Thomas Masaryk, to act as the founder of the new\nreligion (Ehrenfels 1929, in PSIV, 289 ff.). Although\nsympathetic to his concerns, Masaryk politely rebuffed him, clearly\ndistinguishing between his personal religious thoughts and his public\npolitical role (see Masaryk\u2019s letter to Ehrenfels in PSIV,\n294 ff.).\n",
