    "main_text": "Noncausal Theories\n1. Noncausal Theories\n\nNoncausal theories of free will are those according to which free\nactions need not be caused by anything and also need not have any\ninternal causal structure. Some theories of this sort hold that free\nactions must be uncaused, while others allow that they may be\nnondeterministically caused. Carl Ginet (1989, 1990, 1997, 2002, 2007,\n2008, 2014, and 2016) and Hugh McCann (1998 and 2012) have set out the\nmost fully developed noncausal theories of free will. Other accounts\nof this type are advanced by Stewart Goetz (1988, 1997, and 2000), E.\nJ. Lowe (2008: chs. 6\u20139 and 2013), Storrs McCall (1994: ch. 9),\nDavid Palmer (2016, forthcoming), and Thomas Pink (2004: chs.\n7\u20138).\n\nWhy might someone find a noncausal theory of free will appealing? An\nhistorically important motivation for such views concerns the nature\nof causation. Once upon a time, all causation was thought to be\ndeterministic. If that were right, then any nondeterministic theory of\nfree will would have to be noncausal. Not until the 20th century did\nthe idea of nondeterministic or probabilistic causation become\npopular. Once it did, this motivation for noncausal theories of free\nwill was lost. Why, then, do some theorists still insist that free\nactions must be uncaused?\n\n\nOne argument advanced for that conclusion is an argument from luck.\nThe idea, in brief, is that if an action is caused (even\nnondeterministically) by prior events, then it cannot have been up to\nthe agent whether that action was performed. If the causation is\nnondeterministic, it will simply be a matter of luck, a matter of\nnature\u2019s \u201crole of the dice\u201d (Ginet 2014: 24) whether\nthe action occurs. Such an argument from luck poses a problem for\nevent-causal libertarian theories, and agent-causal libertarian\ntheories face a similar problem. We discuss responses available in\ndefense of these theories below, in sections 2.2, 2.3, and 3.2.\n\nNoncausal theories of free will face two main objections. Both are\nobjections, in the first instance, to noncausal accounts of\nintentional action. If the theories at issue can\u2019t give an\nadequate noncausal account of action, then a fortiori they can\u2019t\ngive us an adequate account of free action. Noncausal theories that\nrequire free actions to be entirely uncaused face a further objection,\nin addition to the two just mentioned. We consider each of these\nobjections in turn.\n",
