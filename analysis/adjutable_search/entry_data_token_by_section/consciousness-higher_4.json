Higher-Order Thought Theory (2): Dispositionalist\n\nAccording to the dispositionalist HOT theory, the conscious status of\nan perceptual state consists in its availability to\nhigher-order thought (Dennett 1978a; Carruthers 1996, 2000, 2005). As\nwith the non-dispositionalist version of the theory, in its simplest\nform we have here a quite general proposal concerning the conscious\nstatus of any type of occurrent mental state, which becomes an account\nof phenomenal consciousness when the states in question are\nexperiences (or images, emotions, etc.) with analog content. The\nproposal is this: a conscious mental event M, of mine, is one\nthat is disposed to cause an activated thought (generally a\nnon-conscious one) that I have\nM, and to cause it non-inferentially.\n\nThe proposal before us is therefore as follows:\n\nDispositionalist Higher-Order Thought Theory:\n\nA phenomenally conscious mental state is a state of a certain sort\n(perhaps with analog/non-conceptual intentional content, and perhaps\nheld in a special-purpose short-term memory store) which is available\nto cause (non-inferentially) higher-order thoughts about itself (or\nperhaps about any of the contents of the memory store).\n\n\nIn contrast with the actualist form of theory, the higher-order\nthoughts that render a percept conscious are not necessarily actual,\nbut potential. So the objection now disappears, that an unbelievable\namount of cognitive space would have to be taken up with every\nconscious experience. (There need not actually be\nany HOT occurring, in order for a given perceptual state to\ncount as phenomenally conscious, on this view.) So we might be able to\nretain our belief in the rich and integrated nature of phenomenally\nconscious experience\u2014we just have to suppose that all of the\ncontents in question are simultaneously available to\nhigher-order thought. (Such availability might be realized by the\n\u2018global broadcast\u2019 of perceptual representations to a wide\nrange of conceptual systems in the brain, for drawing inferences, for\nforming memories, and for planning, as well as for forming\nhigher-order beliefs. See Baars 1988, 1997, 2002.) Nor will there be\nany problem in explaining why our faculty of higher-order thought\nshould have evolved, nor why it should have access to perceptual\ncontents in the first place\u2014this can be the standard sort of\nstory in terms of Machiavellian intelligence.\n\nIt might well be wondered how their mere availability to\nhigher-order thoughts could confer on our perceptual states the\npositive properties distinctive of phenomenal consciousness\u2014that\nis, of states having a subjective dimension, or a distinctive\nsubjective feel. The answer may lie in the theory of content.\nSuppose that one agrees with Millikan (1984) that the representational\ncontent of a state depends, in part, upon the powers of the systems\nthat consume that state. That is, suppose one thinks that\nwhat a state represents will depend, in part, on the kinds of\ninferences that the cognitive system is prepared to make in the\npresence of that state, or on the kinds of behavioral control that it\ncan exert. In that case the presence of first-order perceptual\nrepresentations to a consumer-system that can deploy a \u2018theory\nof mind\u2019, and that is capable of recognitional applications of\ntheoretically-embedded concepts of experience, may be sufficient to\nrender those representations at the same time as higher-order\nones. This would be what confers on our phenomenally conscious\nexperiences the dimension of subjectivity. Each experience would at\nthe same time (while also representing some state of the world, or of\nour own bodies) be a representation that we are undergoing just such\nan experience, by virtue of the powers of the \u2018theory of\nmind\u2019 system. Each percept of green, for example, would at one\nand the same time be an analog representation of green and an\nanalog (non-conceptual) representation of seems green\nor experience of green. (Consumer semantics embraces not only\na number of different varieties of teleosemantics, but also\nvarious forms of inferential role semantics. For the former,\nsee Millikan 1984, 1986, 1989; and Papineau 1987, 1993. For the\nlatter, see Loar 1981, 1982; McGinn 1982, 1989; Block 1986; and\nPeacocke 1986, 1992). \n\nAs an independent illustration of how consumer systems can transform\nperceptual contents, consider prosthetic vision (Bach-y-Rita 1995;\nBach-y-Rita and Kercel 2003). Blind subjects can be fitted with a\ndevice that transduces the output from a hand-held or head-mounted\nvideo-camera into patterns of electrically-induced tactile stimulation\nacross the subject\u2019s back or tongue. Initially, of course, the\nsubjects just feel patterns of gentle tickling sensations spreading\nover the area in question, while the camera scans what is in front of\nthem. But provided that they are allowed to control the movements of\nthe camera themselves, their experiences after a time acquire\nthree-dimensional distal intentional contents, representing the\npositions and movements of objects in space.(Note that the patterns of\ntactile simulations themselves become imbued with spatial content. The\nsubjects in question say that it has come to seem to them\nthat there is a spherical object moving towards them, for example.)\nHere everything on the input side remains the same as it was when\nsubjects first began to wear the device; but the planning and\naction-controlling systems have learned to interpret those states\ndifferently. And as a result, the subjects\u2019 first-order\nintentional perceptual contents have become quite different. Likewise,\naccording to dispositional HOT theory, when the \u2018theory of\nmind\u2019 system has learned to interpret the subject\u2019s\nperceptual states as perceptual states: they all acquire a\ndimension of seeming or subjectivity.\n\nProponents of this account hold that it achieves all of the benefits\nof inner-sense theory, but without the associated costs. (Some\npotential draw-backs will be noted in a moment.) In particular, we can\nendorse the claim that phenomenal consciousness consists in a set of\nhigher-order perceptions. This enables us to explain, not only the\ndifference between conscious and unconscious perception, but also how\nanalog states come to acquire a subjective dimension or\n\u2018feel\u2019. And we can also explain how it can be possible for\nus to acquire some purely recognitional concepts of experience (thus\nexplaining the standard philosophical thought-experiments concerning\nzombies and such-like). But we don\u2019t have to appeal to the\nexistence of any \u2018inner scanners\u2019 or organs of inner sense\n(together with their associated problems) in order to do\nthis. Moreover, it should also be obvious why there can be no question\nof our higher-order contents misrepresenting their first-order\ncounterparts, in such a way that one might be disposed to make\nrecognitional judgments of red and seems orange at\nthe same time. This is because the content of the higher-order\nexperience is parasitic on the content of the first-order\none. Carruthers, therefore, also refers to this view as dual\ncontent theory.\n\nOn the downside, the account isn\u2019t neutral on questions of\nsemantic theory. On the contrary, it requires us to reject any form of\npure input semantics, in favor of some sort of consumer semantics. We\ncannot then accept that intentional content reduces to informational\ncontent, nor that it can be explicated purely in terms of causal\nco-variance relations to the environment. So anyone who finds such\nviews attractive will think that the account is a hard one to swallow.\n(For discussion of various different versions of input semantics, see\nDretske 1981, 1986; Fodor 1987, 1990; and Loewer and Rey 1991.)\n\nMoreover, Rosenthal (2005) has objected that dispositional HOT theory\ncan\u2019t account for our actual awareness of our conscious\nmental states, since mere dispositions to entertain thoughts\ndoesn\u2019t make us aware of anything. Two replies can be made (see\nCarruthers 2000, 2005). One is that, in virtue of our disposition to\nentertain higher-order thoughts about it, a perceptual state will\nalready possess an analog higher-order content. It is this\ncontent that makes us aware of the experience in question. But the\nsecond reply is that there does, in any case, seem to be a perfectly\ngood dispositional sense of \u2018know\u2019 and\n\u2018aware\u2019. As Dennett pointed out long ago (1978b), I can be\nsaid to know, or to be aware, that zebras in the wild don\u2019t wear\novercoats, even though I have never actually considered the matter,\nbecause I am disposed to assent to that proposition in light\nof what I occurrently know.\n\nIn addition, Rowlands (2001) and Jehle and Kriegel (2006) have\nobjected that dispositional HOT theory can\u2019t explain the sense\nin which the phenomenal properties of experience are\ncategorical. For the higher-order analog intentional contents\nthat our conscious perceptual states possess\u2014and that are\nidentified with the \u2018feel\u2019 of experience\u2014are said to\nbe constituted by the dispositional property that such states have, of\ngiving rise to HOTs about themselves. This objection,\nhowever, appears to beg the question in favor of irreducible and\nintrinsic qualia as an account of the distinctive properties of\nphenomenally conscious states. In any case it doesn\u2019t seem to be an\nobjection against dispositional HOT theory as such, since it will\ncount equally against any representationalist theory of consciousness.\n(For example, Tye 1995, explains consciousness in terms of the\npoisedness of perceptual states to have an impact on belief\nand reasoning, which is a dispositional notion.) Any theory that\nproposes to reductively explain phenomenal consciousness in terms of\nsome combination of intentional content and causal role will be\nexplaining consciousness in terms that are at least partly\ndispositional. \n\nA well-known objection to dispositionalist higher-order thought\ntheory, however, is that it may have to deny phenomenal consciousness\nto most species of non-human animal. This objection will be discussed,\namong others, in section 7, since it can be raised\nagainst any form of higher-order theory.\n\nCarruthers no longer holds dispositional HOT theory or, for that\nmatter, any form of higher-order theory and actually defends a version\nof first-order representationalism instead (Carruthers 2017). He\nresponds to his own previous two main lines of argument against\nfirst-order representationalism and then finds it unnecessary to\npropose a higher-order theory in order to explain the difference\nbetween unconscious and conscious states. Still, Carruthers thinks\nthat dispositional HOT theory is preferable to actualist HOT\ntheory.\n",
