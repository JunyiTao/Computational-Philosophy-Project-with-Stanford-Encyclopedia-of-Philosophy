    "main_text": "Alternative treatments of convention || Miller: collective ends\n6.2 Miller: collective ends\n\n\nSeumas Miller (2001) introduces the notion of a \u201ccollective\nend.\u201d A collective end is an end that is shared by a group of\nagents and that can be achieved only through action by all of those\nagents; moreover, these facts are mutually believed by the agents. A\nconvention to \\(j\\) in some recurring situation \\(s\\) prevails among\nsome agents iff it is mutually believed by the agents that each one has\na standing intention to \\(j\\) in \\(s\\), as long as others perform \\(j\\) in\n\\(s\\), so as to realize some shared collective end \\(e\\). For\ninstance, the collective end corresponding to the convention of driving\non the right side of the road is avoiding collisions.\n\n\nIn many respects, Miller\u2019s account is more similar to\nLewis\u2019s than to Gilbert\u2019s. Miller shares Lewis\u2019s\n\u201creductionist\u201d perspective, analyzing social convention as\na pattern of interaction between rational agents, without any\nirreducibly \u201csocial\u201d element. In particular, Miller rejects\nsui generis social entities, such as plural subjects, and he\ndoes not invoke specialized norms of convention beyond those engendered\nby morality and rationality.\n\n\nOne objection to Miller\u2019s account is that, in many cases, there\nis no clear \u201ccollective end\u201d subserved by convention. For\ninstance, what collective end must participants in a monetary practice\nshare? It seems that each agent might care only about his own\nindividual welfare, without concern for some more general social end.\nEven where there is a clear collective end served by some convention,\nshould we really build this fact into the definition of\nconvention? As Burge observes, \u201cparties to a convention are\nfrequently confused about the relevant ends (the social functions of\ntheir practice); they are often brought up achieving them and do not\nknow the origins of their means\u201d (1975, p. 252). Thus, it might\nseem that Miller attributes too much self-understanding to participants\nin a convention.\n",
