    "main_text": "A New Law of Thought || Observations on Intension and Extension\n2.3 Observations on Intension and Extension\n\nAlthough the concept of intension plays an important role in\nJones\u2019s theory, she recognizes that grasping the intension of a\nname is neither necessary nor sufficient for grasping its extension.\nOne may grasp the intension of a term and not grasp its extension, or\nconversely, grasp its extension but not its intension. Although\nundeveloped, her observations here are remarkably prescient.\n\nConcerning the possibility that grasping an expression\u2019s\nextension does not require grasping its intension, she writes:\n\n\nI know that metal in extension denotes gold, silver, copper,\niron, lead, tin, mercury, aluminium, etc., and I know these when I see\nthem, but I am not able to give a satisfactory statement of the\nintension which they have in common\u2026\n\nOr again I know, or I may know, all the inhabitants of a country\nparish and be able to greet them correctly by name when I meet them,\nbut may be entirely unable to give a recognizable description of any\nof them. Or I may know real diamonds from paste, or one disease from\nanother, and always apply the names rightly, and yet be unable to set\nout even to myself the connotation or intension. (1911b, 13)\n\n\nThe point applies to the intensions of proper names as well as natural\nkind terms. What these considerations suggest, as similar\nconsiderations later suggested to Gareth Evans (1982), Saul Kripke\n(1980) and Hilary Putnam (1975), is that names and natural kind terms\ndo not pick out their referents descriptively: mastery of either\nproper names or natural kind terms does not require that we associate\nwith them any reference-determining description. Jones, however,\ndoesn\u2019t draw this bold conclusion. In fact, she thinks the\nobservation is harmless, since, on her view, the intension of a term\ncan be reconstructed by reflecting on its extension:\n\nWhat I insist on is that all the names we use have both extension and\nintension; and either of these may be a guide to the other. I may have\nthe things to which a name applies put before me\u2026 and from\nexamination of them reach the intension; or have intension given, and\ngo out and by means of it determine extension. (1911b, 14)\n\n\nIt doesn\u2019t appear, however, that Jones is committing herself to\nany strong thesis here\u2014that, contra Russell, there is a\n\u201cbackward road\u201d from referent to sense; only that, in\npractice, a term\u2019s intension can often be gleaned from\nexamination of its extension.\n\nIn addition, grasping a term\u2019s intension does not guarantee\nbeing able to identify its extension:\n\nOn the other hand I may have full descriptive knowledge of a person or\nplant or precious stone, and yet not be able to recognize the person\nor plant or jewel though it may much concern me to do so. I may even\nknow much more about a person than his ordinary acquaintances, or even\nthan his dearest friend, and be able to give a much more accurate\ndescription of his appearance and manner, and yet not know him when I\nmeet him. (1911b, 13\u20134)\n\n\nTo connect this observation with the previous, we must assume that the\ncompetent use of N, where N is a name or natural\nkind term, involves a capacity to recognize N\u2019s\nreferent. What this passage then shows is that this recognitional\ncapacity is not grounded in our grasping any reference-securing\ndescription or intension. But then grasping a name\u2019s intension\ndoes not, by itself, put one in a position to use it to refer.\n\nOf course, the points are, as indicated, undeveloped, and the above\ninterpretation, written in the light of later discussions by Kripke,\nPutnam and Gareth Evans, may put more weight on Jones\u2019s remarks\nthan they can plausibly bear. But the passage\u2019s placement early\non in the monograph reflects an awareness of its significance. (The\npassage does, of course, fail to register the thought that her\nobservations could undermine a key aspect of her proposal\u2014that\nnames and natural kind terms have intensions, or sense.)\n",
