    "main_text": "Life and Works\n1. Life and Works\n\nGorampa was born in 1429 in eastern Tibet. At age nineteen, he\ntraveled to central Tibet to pursue monastic studies. He briefly\nattended Nalendra monastery, one of the prominent Sakya monastic\ninstitutions in Tibet, where he studied Madhyamaka texts with the\nscholar Rongton Sheja Kunrig (Rong ston Shes bya Kun rigs,\n1367\u20131449). Rongton passed away the following summer, and\nGorampa began to travel throughout central Tibet, studying with a\nnumber of other teachers. In addition to becoming a skilled\nphilosopher, Gorampa mastered a variety of Tantric practices,\nincluding the Lamdre (lam \u2018bras), the defining practice\nof the Sakya School.\n\nAfter completing his studies, Gorampa became a teacher, and in 1473 he\nfounded Thubten Namgyal Ling Monastery, developing a curriculum that\nemphasized both rigorous philosophical education and thorough training\nin meditative practices. Gorampa later spent four years as the sixth\nabbot of Ewam Choden, the primary institution of the Ngor subsect of\nthe Sakya school. He died in 1489.\n\nGorampa lived during a period of political instability in Tibet. From\n1244 until 1354, the Sakya sect had held political control over Tibet,\nand was backed by the support of the Mongol army. Eventually the\nMongolian court\u2019s interest in Tibet weakened, and the Pagmodruk\nsect of Tibetan Buddhism ousted the Sakyapas from power in a violent\nconfrontation. The Pagmodrukpas continued to rule over Tibet for over\na century, but by the latter half of Gorampa\u2019s life, they had\nfallen from power, resulting in a number of groups fiercely competing\nfor religious and political dominance.\n\nGorampa composed his philosophical texts, therefore, at a time in\nwhich the Sakya sect was struggling to re-assert its dominance.\nAlthough verifiable information about the political motivations of the\nSakyapas remains elusive, the unstable political situation in Tibet\ncould have at least partially accounted for the overtly polemical\nnature of some of Gorampa\u2019s philosophical writings. When the\nGelugpas eventually ascended to political power in the sixteenth\ncentury, the fifth Dalai Lama ordered that Gorampa\u2019s texts,\nwhich were so critical of Tsongkhapa, be destroyed or otherwise\nremoved from monastic institutions. However, many of Gorampa\u2019s\ntexts continued to be studied in eastern Tibet, beyond the Central\nTibetan government\u2019s scope of influence.\n\nWhen work began on the republication of Gorampa\u2019s writings in\n1905, thirteen volumes of texts were recovered from monasteries\nthroughout Tibet. In addition to his works on Madhyamaka philosophy,\nGorampa composed a number of treatises on Abhidharma, several\ncommentaries on the Indian text the\nAbhisamay\u0101la\u1e45k\u0101ra, and various practice texts\nbased on Tantra. Gorampa\u2019s complete Madhyamaka texts comprise\nonly two of these thirteen volumes. These are:\n\nDistinguishing the View (lta ba\u2019i shan\n\u2018byed), a polemical text distinguishing Gorampa\u2019s own\nview from those of Tsongkhapa (Tsong kha pa bLo bzang Grags pa,\n1357\u20131419) and Dolpopa (Dol po pa Shes rab rGyal mtshan,\n1292\u20131361);\nElucidating the View (lta ba ngan sel), a\ncommentary on the Indian scholar Candrak\u012brti\u2019s\nMadhyamak\u0101vat\u0101ra;\nSynopsis of Madhyamaka (dbu ma\u2019i spyi\ndon), an encyclopedic text outlining Gorampa\u2019s views on the\nmajor points of Madhyamaka, as well as the views of a number of Indian\nand Tibetan scholars with whom he both agrees and disagrees.\n The main difference in these texts concerns the ways in which\nGorampa presents his philosophical view. Distinguishing the\nView is a polemical text in which Gorampa focuses on the\nmetaphysics of Madhyamaka, positioning his own interpretation as a\nsort of middle way between other interpretations that cast Madhyamaka\nin terms of nihilism or eternalism. Elucidating the View\nfocuses on the process through which a follower of Madhyamaka\ntransforms her mind as she progresses toward complete awakening.\nSynopsis of Madhyamaka presents Gorampa\u2019s interpretation\nof Madhyamaka in three ways: ontologically, in terms of its grounding\n(bzhi) in the two truths; ethically, in terms of the path\n(lam) that a Buddhist must follow; and epistemologically, in\nterms of the mental content that a Buddha experiences as a result\n(\u2018bras bu) of complete awakening.\n\n\nDespite the different emphases of these three texts, Gorampa\u2019s\ngeneral presentation of Madhyamaka remains consistent throughout his\nwritings. This is especially striking when compared to Gorampa\u2019s\nrough contemporaries, including Tsongkhapa and \u015a\u0101kya\nChokden, whose views evolved over the course of their careers. The\nrelative stability of Gorampa\u2019s views over his lifetime is one\nreason why he is held in such high regard among proponents of the\nSakya tradition.\n",
