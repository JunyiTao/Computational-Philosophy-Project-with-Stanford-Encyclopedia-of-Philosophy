    "main_text": "Some varieties of definition || Real and nominal definitions\n1.1 Real and nominal definitions\n\nJohn Locke distinguished, in his Essay, \u201creal\nessence\u201d from \u201cnominal essence.\u201d Nominal essence,\naccording to Locke, is the \u201cabstract Idea to which\nthe Name is annexed (III.vi.2).\u201d Thus, the nominal essence\nof the name \u2018gold\u2019, Locke said, \u201cis that complex\nIdea the word Gold stands for, let it be, for\ninstance, a Body yellow, of a certain weight, malleable, fusible, and\nfixed.\u201d In contrast, the real essence of gold is \u201cthe\nconstitution of the insensible parts of that Body, on which those\nQualities [mentioned in the nominal essence] and all other Properties\nof Gold depend (III.vi.2).\u201d A rough way of marking the\ndistinction between real and nominal definitions is to say, following\nLocke, that the former states real essence, while the latter states\nnominal essence. The chemist aims at real definition, whereas the\nlexicographer aims at nominal definition.\n\nThis characterization of the distinction is rough because a\nzoologist\u2019s definition of \u201ctiger\u201d should count as a\nreal definition, even though it may fail to provide \u201cthe\nconstitution of the insensible parts\u201d of the tiger. Moreover, an\naccount of the meaning of a word should count as a nominal definition,\neven though it may not take the Lockean form of setting out \u201cthe\nabstract idea to which the name is annexed.\u201d Perhaps it is\nhelpful to indicate the distinction between real and nominal\ndefinitions thus: to discover the real definition of a term \\(X\\) one\nneeds to investigate the thing or things denoted by \\(X\\); to discover\nthe nominal definition, one needs to investigate the meaning and use\nof \\(X\\). Whether the search for an answer to the Socratic question\n\u201cWhat is virtue?\u201d is a search for real definition or one\nfor nominal definition depends upon one\u2019s conception of this\nparticular philosophical activity. When we pursue the Socratic\nquestion, are we trying to gain a clearer view of our uses of the word\n\u2018virtue\u2019, or are we trying to give an account of an ideal\nthat is to some extent independent of these uses? Under the former\nconception, we are aiming at a nominal definition; under the latter,\nat a real definition.\n\nSee Robinson 1950 for a critical discussion of the different\nactivities that have been subsumed under \u201creal\ndefinition,\u201d and see Charles 2010 for ancient views on the\ntopic. Fine 1994 defends the conception that a real definition defines\nan object by specifying what the object is; in other words, a real\ndefinition spells out the essence of the object defined. Rosen 2015\noffers an explanation of real definition in terms of grounding: the\ndefinition provides the ground of the essence of the object. The\nmeaning of \u2018essence\u2019 and of \u2018ground\u2019 remain\nunder active debate, however.\n",
