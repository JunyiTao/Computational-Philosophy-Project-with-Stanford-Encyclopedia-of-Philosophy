    "main_text": "\n\n\nArguments from precedent and analogy are two central forms of\nreasoning found in many legal systems, especially \u2018Common\nLaw\u2019 systems such as those in England and the United\nStates. Precedent involves an earlier decision being followed in a\nlater case because both cases are the same. Analogy involves an\nearlier decision being followed in a later case because the later case\nis similar to the earlier one. The main philosophical problems raised\nby precedent and analogy are these: (1) when are two cases the\n\u2018same\u2019 for the purposes of precedent? (2) when are two\ncases \u2018similar\u2019 for the purposes of analogy? and (3) in\nboth situations, why should the decision in the earlier case affect\nthe decision in the later case?\n\n\nThe study of precedent and analogy is of interest for a number of\nreasons:\n\nsome theorists claim that precedent involves a form of reasoning\ndifferent to reasoning using rules;\nalthough arguments from precedent are extremely common in many\ninstitutional and quasi-institutional settings, not merely the law,\nthere is no consensus on the rational basis for their force, nor indeed\non whether such arguments have any rational force;\nsome theorists argue that the use of analogies in law is not a\nform of \u2018reasoning\u2019 at all; and finally,\neven if there is an intelligible form of analogical reasoning, it\nis unclear why the similarity between two situations provides a reason\nfor treating them both in the same manner.\n\n\n\nThe law presents a useful context for considering these issues\nbecause its use of precedent and analogy is well articulated and\nexplicit.
