    "main_text": "Attempts to Explain the Nature of Normativity || Conclusion\n4.9 Conclusion\n\nEach of these eight strategies for explaining normativity has of\ncourse been contested. In cases in which the explanans uses\nnormative concepts, there is the objection that the account\ndoesn\u2019t explain normativity as such, but only reduces\nnormativity to one variety of normative consideration. In cases where\nthe explanans does not use normative concepts, there is the\npotential to provide an analysis of what normativity consists in.\nHowever, of course, every putative analysis invites objections. And,\nin every case where the putative analysis is substantive and\nphilosophically interesting, it can be denied with some\nplausibility.\n\nA familiar challenge is the \u201cso what\u201d challenge. So what\nif this act is required by the system of norms best suited to address\nthe problem of sociality, what is that to me? So what if sustaining my\npractical identity requires this act; what is that to me if doing this\nact would involve a great sacrifice? So what if my agency in a special\nprivileged sense depends on my performing this act; why should I care\nabout being an agent in this sense?\n\nIt is no accident that this all-purpose objection bears a family\nresemblance to Moore\u2019s open question argument. And the best\nresponses to it are similar to familiar responses to Moore. A\nsubstantive analysis of a philosophically interesting concept would\nnot be informative if it were obviously correct. And nothing\nguarantees that the best analysis of a philosophically interesting\nconcept will be obviously correct. Further, a metaphysical analysis of\nwhat the normativity of a worldly property or state of affairs could\nconsist in is not likely to be a priori. The more informative\nand interesting a putative analysis is, the less likely it is that it\nwill seem obviously correct, so the more it will seem open to\nobjection. (See entries on\n analysis\n and\n moral non-naturalism, section on the open question argument).\n",
