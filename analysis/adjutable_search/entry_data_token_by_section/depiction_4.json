    "main_text": "Psychological Theories of Depiction || Recognition-Based Theories\n3.2 Recognition-Based Theories\n\nWe noted in\n \u00a73.1\n that experiential theories seek to explain depiction in terms of the\nkind of experience a picture causes in a spectator, rather than the\nsubpersonal cognitive mechanisms a picture is thought to engage. Some\nphilosophers therefore maintain that theories which explain depiction\nin terms of the propensity of a picture to activate a\nspectator\u2019s recognitional skills are not experiential theories,\non the grounds that recognition can occur without experience (Matthen\n2005: 25\u201326; Newall 2011: 21\u201323). Others either claim or\nassume, on the contrary, that recognition is a kind of\nexperience, at least the kind of recognition that is stimulated by a\npicture (Squires 1969; Schier 1986).\n\nThe basic thought that underlies recognition-based theories of\ndepiction is that a picture must be recognisable:\n\n\nIt must be the kind of thing that can be connected up with what the\nartist had in mind, if looked at in the right way by people with\naptitude and experience. [\u2026] Ultimately, we establish what is\nrecognisable by reference to what is recognised. (Squires 1969:\n203)\n\n\nThe same thought is developed by Schier. As noted above (see\n \u00a72),\n Schier claims that our interpretation of pictures, unlike our\ninterpretation of words, is generated naturally:\n\n\nOnce you have succeeded in an initial pictorial interpretation\n[\u2026] you should then be able to interpret novel icons without\nbeing privy to additional stipulations given only that you can\nrecognise the object or state of affairs depicted. (Schier 1986:\n43)\n\n\nAccordingly, Schier argues that depiction can be defined in terms of\nnatural generativity and recognition: a picture is the kind of\nrepresentation that causes naturally generated interpretations in\ncompetent spectators by activating their recognitional skills. Thus,\n\u201cpictures are symbols whose interpretation can be causally\nexplained by relevant recognitional abilities\u201d (Schier 1986:\n49). Specifically, \u201ca picture of O is precisely something\nwhich can trigger the interpreter\u2019s O-recognising\nabilities\u201d (Schier 1986: 195).\n\nSchier\u2019s basic thought was subsequently incorporated into an\neclectic theory of depiction by Dominic Lopes (1996). Drawing on\nGareth Evans\u2019s information-theoretic account of reference (Evans\n1982; see \u00a72.3 of the entry on\n reference)\n and Kendall Walton\u2019s controversial claim that photographs are\n\u201ctransparent\u201d (Walton 1984), as well as Schier\u2019s\nrecognition-based theory of depiction, Lopes defends the following\nideas.\n\nFirst, pictures belong to \u201cinformation systems\u201d, and\ntransmit perceptual information from their subjects (Lopes 1996: 107),\nthereby engaging (and also extending) the recognitional skills\nspectators exercise in ordinary visual perception. \u201cThe ability\nto work out what pictures depict covaries with the ability to\nrecognize their depicta in the flesh\u201d (2005a: 170). Second,\nLopes adopts Walton\u2019s claim that photographs are\n\u201ctransparent\u201d, i.e., spectators literally see the\nobjects that appear in photographs, as if through a pane of glass, and\nnot merely visual records or sources of information about them.\nHowever, Lopes extends this claim to encompass every kind of picture:\n\u201cthere is as much reason to believe that we see through\npaintings and drawings as through photographs\u201d (1996: 181).\nThird, pictures present aspects of their subjects, by making both\n\u201ccommitments\u201d and \u201cnon-commitments\u201d regarding\ntheir properties: \u201cEvery picture represents its subject as\nhaving some property that precludes it from making commitments about\nsome other property\u201d (Lopes 1996: 125). For example, a picture\nthat depicts a man sporting a beard makes a commitment regarding the\nproperty of being hirsute, but by the same token is non-commital\nregarding the property of having a dimpled chin. Explicit\n\u201cnon-commitment\u201d distinguishes depiction from other kinds\nof representation. (For criticism see Herwitz 2000, Savile 2000,\nKulvicki 2006.) Fourth, pictorial styles, or systems of pictorial\nrepresentation, differ from each other in the kinds of aspects they\ntypically present. Pictorial competence is relative to specific styles\nor systems: to be able to interpret a picture, one needs to have the\nrecognitional skills corresponding to the system to which it belongs\n(Lopes 1996: 152\u20133).\n\nThese ideas face various difficulties, some of which we have already\nconsidered in connection with other experiential theories. First,\nLopes\u2019s ideas about the transmission of perceptual information\nand the transparency of pictures are difficult to apply to pictures of\nfictional individuals and genre pictures (Hopkins 1997). Second, the\ntransparency claim has been criticised even in the case of\nphotographs, where the problem of fictional subjects and genre\npictures does not normally arise (Currie 1995). Third, the claim that\npictures differ from other kinds of representations in that only\npictures explicitly \u201cnon-commit\u201d to properties has been\nchallenged (Kulvicki 2006). Finally, as we have seen, Walton\u2019s\ntheory that picture are props in games of visual make-believe does not\nseem capable of explaining how the shapes of the marks on the surface\nof a picture constrain the shapes of the objects they represent, or\nthe imaginative games they invite spectators to engage in.\nRecognition-based theories are open to a similar objection. Various\ntheories of depiction are compatible with the claim that pictures\nactivate the same recognitional skills as the kinds of objects they\ndepict. The question on which they differ is why they do so. For\nexample, is it because the shape of a region on a picture\u2019s\nsurface is identical to the occlusion shape of the object it depicts?\nOr is it because part of a picture\u2019s surface occupies a region\nof the spectator\u2019s two-dimensional visual field that she\nexperiences as similar in shape to a region in which the kind of\nobject that it depicts could be presented? Or is it for some other\nreason? Without an answer to this question, the problem of explaining\nhow pictures represent is elaborated by introducing ideas about\nrecognition, natural generativity and transparency, but it is not\nsolved (Newman 1998; cf. Neander 1987, Sartwell 1991).\n",
