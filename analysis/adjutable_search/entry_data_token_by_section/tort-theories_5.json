    "main_text": "Contemporary Philosophical Approaches to Tort Law || Other Versions of Corrective Justice Theory\n4.3 Other Versions of Corrective Justice Theory\n\nIn the past three decades, multiple versions of corrective justice\ntheory have been proposed. On Weinrib\u2019s formulation, corrective\njustice is a principle that is limited to transactional wrongs, which\nincludes both breaches of contract and violations of individual rights\nto person and property. On this view, the apparatus of corrective\njustice is brought to bear on only a certain class of\ntransactions.\n\nA more expansive conception of corrective justice was proposed by\nJules Coleman (2001). Coleman compares the principle of corrective\njustice to that of retributive justice. He argues that, just as the\nprinciple of retribution does not contain a complete catalogue of the\ncrimes worthy of punishment, but rather simply says that serious\ncrimes merit retributive punishment, so, too, the theory of corrective\njustice is on its own silent on the question of the types of\ninterpersonal wrongs that are its appropriate subject matter. For\nColeman, then, the principle of corrective justice is a general\nprinciple of responsive conduct, which awaits an independent theory of\ntortious wrongdoing to which it is to be applied. Coleman offered\nseveral different accounts of the principle of corrective justice: on\none version its purpose was to \u201cannul\u201d wrongful gains and\nlosses; a different, later version emphasized the reversal of the\neffects of wrongful acts by the particular person responsible for\nthem. On both of these accounts, the concepts of wrongdoing and\nresponsibility are placeholders, consistent with a wide variety of\nviews about which acts are wrongful and about the conditions under\nwhich someone can be responsible for an outcome.\n\nA still more expansive account of corrective justice was proposed by\nJohn Gardner (2011). For Gardner, the principle of corrective justice\nis a general principle about inappropriate conduct, according to which\nthe failure to do what one has reason to do does not mean those\nreasons come to an end; the normal response to such failure is to do\nthe next best thing. Gardner illustrates this with the example of\nkeeping a promise: having promised someone to meet them for lunch at\nnoon, the promisor who is behind schedule must still show up at 12:15.\nThe promised act of meeting at noon can no longer be done, and so, on\nGardner\u2019s analysis, there can be no duty to arrive at noon, and\nno right that the promisor arrive by noon. Instead, there is a new\nduty, the duty to do the next best thing. Gardner applies this\nanalysis to tort liability. If I had a duty to avoid injuring you\nbecause I had sufficient reason not to injure you, and I injure you\nanyway, my duty to avoid injuring you can no longer be satisfied. But\nall of the reasons that supported the duty will normally still be in\noperation; as such, those reasons put me under a new duty, this time\nto repair the wrong that I have done. Gardner describes his view as an\naccount of corrective justice because it regulates \u201cthe reversal\nof wrongful transactions on the ground of their wrongfulness\u201d\n(2011: 22). Correction is thus the correction of a failure to conform\nto reasons that apply to you: \n\n\nthe reasons why one must pay for the losses that one occasions are the\nvery same reasons why one must not occasion those losses in the first\nplace, when it is true that one must not occasion them. (2011: 34)\n\n\n\nGardner\u2019s account differs significantly from Weinrib\u2019s\nbecause of its exclusive focus on the relation between wrongdoers and\nthe reasons that apply to them, rather than the relation between the\nparties. The fact that those reasons make reference to the wronged\nparty is not essential to the operation of Gardner\u2019s conception\nof corrective justice.
