    "main_text": "Virtues and Character Formation\n5. The Family and the State\n\nEarly Zhou political philosophy as represented in the Classic of\nOdes and the Classic of Documents centered on moral\njustification for political authority based on the doctrine of the\n\u201cMandate of Heaven\u201d (tianming\n\u5929\u547d). This view was that the sage\u2019s virtue\n(de) attracted the attention of the anthropomorphized cosmic\npower usually translated as \u201cHeaven\u201d (tian\n\u5929), which supported the sage\u2019s rise to political\nauthority. These canonical texts argued that political success or\nfailure is a function of moral quality, evidenced by actions such as\nproper ritual performance, on the part of the ruler. Confucius drew on\nthese classics and adapted the classical view of moral authority in\nimportant ways, connecting it to a normative picture of\nsociety. Positing a parallel between the nature of reciprocal\nresponsibilities of individuals in different roles in two domains of\nsocial organization, in the Analects Confucius linked filial piety in the family to\nloyalty in the political realm: \n\n\nIt is rare for a person who is filially pious to his parents and older\nsiblings to be inclined to rebel against his superiors\u2026 Filial\npiety to parents and elder siblings may be considered the root of a\nperson. (1.2) \n\n\nThis section examines Confucius\u2019s social and political\nphilosophy, beginning with the central role of his analysis of the\ntraditional norm of filial piety.\n\nJust as Confucius analyzed the psychology of ritual performance and\nrelated it to individual moral development, his discussion of filial\npiety was another example of the development and adaptation of a\nparticular classical cultural pattern to a wider philosophical context\nand set of concerns. Originally limited to descriptions of sacrifice\nto ancestors in the context of hereditary kinship groups, a more\nextended meaning of \u201cfilial piety\u201d was used to describe\nthe sage king Shun\u2019s \u821c (trad. r. 2256\u20132205 BCE)\ntreatment of his living father in the Classic of\nDocuments. Despite humble origins, Shun\u2019s filial piety was\nrecognized as a quality that signaled he would be a suitable successor\nfor the sage king Yao \u582f (trad.  r. 2357\u20132256\nBCE). Confucius in the Analects praised the ancient sage\nkings at great length, and the sage king Yu \u79b9 for his filial\npiety in the context of sacrifice (8.21). However, he used the term\nfilial piety to mean both sacrificial mastery and behaving\nappropriately to one\u2019s parents. In a conversation with one of\nhis disciples he explains that filial piety meant \u201cnot\ncontesting\u201d, and that it entailed: \n\n\nwhile one\u2019s parents were alive, serving them in a ritually\nproper way, and after one\u2019s parents died, burying them and\nsacrificing to them in a ritually proper way. (2.5) \n\n\nIn rationalizing the moral content of legacies of the past like the\nthree-year mourning period after the death of a parent, Confucius\nreasoned that for three years a filially pious child should not alter\na parent\u2019s way (4.20, cf. 19.18), and explains the origin of\nlength of the three-year mourning period to be the length of time that\nthe parents had given their infant child support (17.21). This\nadaptation of filial piety to connote the proper way for a gentleman\nto behave both inside and outside the home was a generalization of a\npattern of behavior that had once been specific to the family.\n\nIntellectual historian Chen Lai \u9648\u6765 has identified two\nsets of ideal traits that became hybridized in the late Warring States\nperiod. The first set of qualities describes the virtue of the ruler\ncoming out of politically-oriented descriptions of figures like King\nWen of Zhou, including uprightness (zhi \u76f4) and\nfortitude (gang \u525b).  The second set of qualities is\nbased on bonds specific to kinship groups, including filial piety and\nkindness (ci \u6148).  As kinship groups were subordinated\nto larger political units, texts began to exhibit hybrid lists of\nideal qualities that drew from both sets.  Consequently, Confucius had\nto effectively integrate clan priorities and state priorities, a\nconciliation illustrated in\nHan\u2019s Intertextual Commentary the Odes by his\ninsistence that filial piety is not simply deference to elders. When\nhis disciple Zengzi \u66fe\u5b50 submitted to a severe beating from his\nfather\u2019s staff in punishment for an offense, Confucius chastises\nZengzi, saying that even the sage king Shun would not have submitted\nto a beating so severe. He goes on to explain that a child has a dual\nset of duties, to both a father and ruler, the former filial piety and\nthe other loyalty. Therefore, protecting one\u2019s body is a duty to\nthe ruler and a counterweight to a duty to submit to one\u2019s\nparent (8). In the Classic of Filial Piety (Xiaojing\n\u5b5d\u7d93), similar reasoning is applied to a redefinition of filial\npiety that rejects behaviors like such extreme submission because\nprotecting one\u2019s body is a duty to one\u2019s parents. This\nsort of qualification suggests that as filial piety moved further\noutside its original family context, it had to be qualified to be integrated\ninto a view that valorized multiple character traits.\n\nSince filial piety was based on a fundamental relationship defined\nwithin the family, one\u2019s family role and state role could\nconflict. A Classic of Documents text spells out the possible\nconflict between loyalty to a ruler and filial piety toward a father\n(\u201cCai Zhong zhi ming\u201d\n\u8521\u4ef2\u4e4b\u547d), a trade-off similar to a story in\nthe Analects about a man named Zhi Gong \u76f4\u8eac\n(Upright Gong) who testified that his father stole a sheep. Although\nConfucius acknowledged that theft injures social order, he judged\nUpright Gong to have failed to be truly \u201cupright\u201d in a\nsense that balances the imperative to testify with special\nconsideration for members of his kinship group:\n\n\n\nIn my circle, being upright differs from this. A father would conceal\nsuch a thing on behalf of his son, and a son would conceal it on\nbehalf of his father. Uprightness is found in this. (13.18) \n\n\nIn this way, too, Confucius was adapting filial piety to a wider\nmanifold of moral behaviors, honing his answer to the question of how\na child balances responsibility to family and loyalty to the state.\nWhile these two traits may conflict with one and other, Sociologist\nRobert Bellah, in his study of Tokugawa and modern Japan, noted how\nthe structural similarity between loyalty and filial piety led to\ntheir both being promoted by the state as interlinked ideals that\nlocated each person in dual networks of responsibility. Confucius was\nmaking this claim when he connected filial piety to the propensity to\nbe loyal to superiors (1.2). Statements like \u201cfilial piety is\nthe root of virtuous action\u201d from the Classic of Filial\nPiety connect loyalty and the kind of action that\nsignals the personal virtue that justifies political authority, as in\nthe historical precedent of the sage king Shun.\n\nOf the classical sources from which Confucius drew, two were\nparticularly influential in discussions of political legitimation. The\nClassic of Odes consists of 305 Zhou period regulated lyrics\n(hence the several translations \u201csongs\u201d,\n\u201codes\u201d, or \u201cpoems\u201d) and became numbered as one\nof the Five Classics (Wujing) in the Han dynasty. Critical to\na number of these lyrics is the celebration of King Wen of\nZhou\u2019s overthrow of the Shang, which is an example of a virtuous\nperson seizing the \u201cMandate of Heaven\u201d: \n\n\nThis King Wen of ours, his prudent heart was well-ordered. He shone in\nserving the High God, and thus enjoyed much good fortune. Unswerving\nin his virtue, he came to hold the domains all around. (\u201cDaming\u201d \u5927\u660e) \n\n\nThe Zhou political theory expressed in this passage is based on the\nidea of a limited moral universe that may not reward a virtuous person\nin isolation, but in which the High God (Shangdi\n\u4e0a\u5e1d, Di \u5e1d) or Heaven will intercede to\nreplace a bad ruler with a person of exceptional\nvirtue. The Classic of Documents is a collection that\nincludes orations attributed to the sage rulers of the past and their\nministers, and its arguments often concern moral authority with a\nfocus on the methods and character of exemplary rulers of the past.\nThe chapter \u201cAnnouncement of Kang\u201d (\u201cKanggao\u201d \u5eb7\u8aa5) is addressed to one of the sons of\nKing Wen, and provides him with a guide for behaving as sage ruler as\nwell as with methods that had been empirically proven successful by\nthose rulers. When it comes to the mandate inherited from King Wen,\nthe chapter insists that the mandate is not unchanging, and so as\nruler the son must always be mindful of it when deciding how to\nact. Further, it is not always possible to understand Heaven, but the\n\u201cfeelings of the people are visible\u201d, and so the ruler\nmust care for his subjects. The Zhou political view that Confucius\ninherited was based on supernatural intercession to place a person\nwith personal virtue in charge of the state, but over time the\nemphasis shifted to the way that the effects of good government could\nbe viewed as proof of a continuing moral justification for that\nplacement.\n\nConfucius himself arguably served as a historical counterexample to the\nclassical \u201cMandate of Heaven\u201d theory, calling into question the\ndirect nature of the support given by Heaven to the person with\nvirtue. The Han period Records of the Historian biography of\nConfucius described him as possessing all the personal qualities\nneeded to govern well, but wandering from state to state because those\nqualities had not been recognized. When his favorite disciple died,\nthe Analects records Confucius saying that \u201cHeaven has\nforsaken me!\u201d (11.9). Wang Chong\u2019s \u738b\u5145\n(27\u2013c.97 CE)\nBalanced Discussions (Lunheng \u8ad6\u8861) uses the phrase\n\u201cuncrowned king\u201d (suwang \u7d20\u738b) to describe the\ntragic situation: \u201cConfucius did not rule as king, but his work\nas uncrowned king may be seen in the Spring and Autumn\nAnnals\u201d (80). The view that through his writings Confucius\ncould prepare the world for the government of a future sage king\nbecame a central part of Confucius lore that has colored the reception\nof his writings since, especially in works related to the Spring\nand Autumn Annals and its Gongyang Commentary.  The\nbiography of Confucius reinforced the tragic cosmological picture that\npersonal virtue did not always guarantee success. Even when\nHeaven\u2019s support is cited in the Analects, it is not a\nmatter of direct intercession, but expressed through personal virtue\nor cultural patterns: \u201cHeaven gave birth to the virtue in me, so\nwhat can Huan Tui \u6853\u9b4b do to me?\u201d (7.23, cf. 9.5). As\nRobert Eno has pointed out, the concept of Heaven also came to be\nincreasingly naturalized in passages like \u201cwhat need does Heaven\nhave to speak?\u201d (17.19). Changing views of the scope of\nHeaven\u2019s activity and the ways human beings may have knowledge\nof that activity fostered a change in the role of Heaven in political\ntheory.\n\nMost often, in dialogues with the rulers of his time, references to\nHeaven were occasions for Confucius to encourage rulers to remain\nattentive to their personal moral development and treat their subjects\nfairly. In integrating the classical legacy of the \u201cMandate of\nHeaven\u201d that applied specifically to the ruler or \u201cSon of\nHeaven\u201d (tianzi \u5929\u5b50), with moral teachings\nthat were directed to a wider audience, the nature of Heaven\u2019s\nintercession came to be understood differently. In the\nAnalects and writings like those attributed to Mencius,\ndescriptions of virtue were often adapted to contexts such as the\nconduct of lesser officials and the navigation of everyday life.\nKwong-Loi Shun notes that in such contexts, the influence of Heaven\nremained as an explanation of both what happened outside of human\ncontrol, like political success or lifespan, and of the source of the\nethical ideal. In the Analects, the gentleman\u2019s awe of\nHeaven is combined with an awe of the words of the sages (16.8), and\nwhen Confucius explains the Zhou theory of the \u201cmandate of\nHeaven\u201d in the Elder Dai\u2019s Records of Ritual, he\ndoes so in order to explain how the signs of a well-ordered society\ndemonstrate that the ruler\u2019s \u201cvirtue matches Heaven\u201d\n(\u201cShaojian\u201d \u5c11\u9592). Heaven is still\nubiquitous in the responses of Confucius to questions from rulers, but\nthe focus of the responses was not on Heaven\u2019s direct\nintercession but rather the ruler\u2019s demonstration of his\npersonal moral qualities.\n\nIn this way, personal qualities of modesty, filial piety or respect\nfor the elders were seen as proof of fitness to serve in an official\ncapacity. Qualification to rule was demonstrated by proper behavior in\nthe social roles defined by the \u201cfive relationships\u201d\n(wulun \u4e94\u502b), a formulation seen in the writings\nof Mencius that became a key feature of the interpretation of works\nassociated with Confucius in the Han dynasty. The Western Han emperors\nwere members of the Liu clan, and works like the Guliang\nCommentary (Guliang zhuan\n\u7a40\u6881\u50b3) to the Spring and Autumn Annals emphasized\nnormative family behavior grounded in the five relationships, which were\n(here, adapted to include mothers and sisters): ruler and subject,\nparent and child, husband and wife, siblings, and friends. Writing\nwith particular reference to the Classic of Filial Piety,\nHenry Rosemont and Roger Ames argue that prescribed social roles are a\ndefining characteristic of the \u201cConfucian tradition\u201d, and\nthat such roles were normative guides to appropriate conduct. They\ncontrast this with the \u201cvirtue ethics\u201d approach they say\nrequires rational calculation to determine moral conduct, while filial\npiety is simply a matter of meeting one\u2019s family obligations.\nJust as the five virtues were placed at the center of later theories\nof moral development, once social roles became systematized in this\nway, selected situational teachings of Confucius consistent with them\ncould become the basis of more abstract, systematic moral theories.\nYet this could not have happened without the adaptation of the\nabstract classical political theory of \u201cHeaven\u2019s\nmandate\u201d, a doctrine that originally supported the ruling clan,\nto argue that Heaven\u2019s influence was expressed through\nparticular concrete expressions of individual virtue. As a result of\nthis adaptation in writings associated with Confucius, the\nruler\u2019s conduct of imperial rituals, performance of filial\npiety, or other demonstrations of personal virtue provided proof of\nmoral fitness that legitimated his political authority. As with the\nrituals and the virtues, filial piety and the mandate of Heaven were\ntransformed as they were integrated with the classics through the\nvoices of Confucius and the rulers and disciples of his era.\n\nEarlier, the usage of \u201cConfucius\u201d as a metonym for\nChinese traditional culture was introduced as a feature of the modern period. Yet the\ncomplexity of the philosophical views associated with\nConfucius\u2014encompassing ethical ideals developed out of a\nsophisticated view of the effects of ritual and music on the\nperformer\u2019s psychology, robust descriptions of the attitudes of traditional exemplars across diverse life contexts, and the abstraction of normative behaviors in the family and state\u2014is due in part to the\nfact that this metonymic usage was to some degree already the case in\nthe Han period. By that time, the teachings of Confucius had gone\nthrough several centuries of gestation, and dialogues and quotations\nfashioned at different points over that time circulated and mixed. Put\nslightly differently, Confucius read the traditional culture of the\nhalcyon Zhou period in a particular way, but this reading was\ncontinuously reflected and refracted through different lenses during\nthe Pre-Imperial period, prior to the results being fixed in diverse early\nImperial period sources like the Analects, the\nRecords of Ritual, and the Records of the Historian.\nWhat remains is the work of the hand of Confucius, but also of his\n\u201cschool\u201d, and even sometimes of his opponents during the\ncenturies that his philosophy underwent elaboration and drift. This process of accretion and elaboration is\nnot uncommon for pre-modern writings, and the resulting breadth and depth explains, at\nleast in part, why the voice of Confucius retained primacy in\npre-modern Chinese philosophical conversations as well as in many modern\ndebates about the role of traditional East Asian culture.\n",
