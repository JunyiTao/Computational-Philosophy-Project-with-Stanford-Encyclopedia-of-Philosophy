    "main_text": "Eternity of the World\n9. Eternity of the World\n\n\nTogether with his Christian contemporaries, Godfrey believed that\nthe world began to be. But much debated was the question whether\nnatural reason can prove this, or whether it can be held solely on the\ngrounds of religious faith. Probably best known for holding that it\ncannot be demonstrated that the world began to be was Thomas Aquinas\nwho in his De aeternitate mundi went a step beyond his earlier\nwritings and maintained not only this but also that an eternally\ncreated world is possible (Wippel, 1984a, 203\u201314). Bonaventure had\npresented a series of arguments to prove that the world began to be,\nand many others strongly defended this position, including Henry of\nGhent (Dales, 1990; Wippel, 1981, 153\u201358). Thus it is not surprising\nthat in his Quodlibet II, q. 3 of Lent, 1286, Godfrey was asked to\ndetermine whether the world or any creature could be or exist from\neternity.\n\n\nGodfrey develops his position in conscious opposition to Henry of\nGhent, and with a considerable but unacknowledged dependency on\nAquinas\u2019s De aeternitate mundi which, as noted above, was\ncontained in his Student Notebook. But after he has, with Aquinas,\nshown that there is no contradiction in holding that something can be\ncreated and still not have begun to be, Godfrey considers certain\nobjections against this position. One of these objections clearly gives\nhim pause. If the world had been created from eternity, on every given\nday extending backward into a beginningless past God could have created\nsome material object such as a stone. But if that had happened, an\nactual infinity of stones would now exist and God could unite all of\nthem into one infinite body. But an infinite body is an impossibility,\nand so too is an infinity of simultaneously existing finite bodies and,\ntherefore, so is an eternally created world (PB 2.68\u201369, 76; Wippel,\n1981, 160\u201363).\n\n\nGodfrey comments that this objection can also be formulated more\nforcefully in terms of human souls, i.e., the actual infinity of human\nsouls that would have resulted from an eternal world eternally\npopulated by human beings with immortal souls. Aquinas had considered\nthis form of the objection in his De aeternitate mundi, and\nhad noted that it has not yet been demonstrated that God could not\nproduce an actual infinity of spiritual beings. Godfrey does not adopt\nthis solution, presumably because he is convinced that an actual\ninfinity of entities whether spiritual or material is impossible.\nInstead he proposes as a possible alternative an eternally populated\nworld involving the transmigration of a finite number of souls to an\ninfinity of bodies, and ordered only to their natural perfection. But\nbecause this world seems to be intended primarily for human beings\ndestined to enjoy eternal happiness in soul and body, Godfrey grants\nthat it may be argued with probability that this world could not have\nbeen created from eternity under the present dispensation by God\u2019s\nordained power. But, he also remarks, this does not prove that no\ncreature or no world could have been eternally created. He concludes\nthat it cannot be demonstrated either that an eternal world is not\npossible, or that it is possible. Either side may be regarded as\nprobable, and neither is to be rejected as theologically erroneous (PB\n2.79\u201380; Wippel, 1981, 167\u201368).\n",
