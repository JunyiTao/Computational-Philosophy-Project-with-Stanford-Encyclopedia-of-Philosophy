    "main_text": "Neural networks || Arguments for connectionism\n4.2 Arguments for connectionism\nConnectionism excites many researchers because of the analogy\nbetween neural networks and the brain. Nodes resemble neurons, while\nconnections between nodes resemble synapses. Connectionist modeling\ntherefore seems more \u201cbiologically plausible\u201d than\nclassical modeling. A connectionist model of a psychological\nphenomenon apparently captures (in an idealized way) how\ninterconnected neurons might generate the phenomenon.\n\nWhen evaluating the argument from biological plausibility, one should\nrecognize that neural networks vary widely in how closely they match\nactual brain activity. Many networks that figure prominently in\nconnectionist writings are not so biologically plausible (Bechtel and\nAbrahamsen 2002: 341\u2013343; Berm\u00fadez 2010: 237\u2013239;\nClark 2014: 87\u201389; Harnish 2002: 359\u2013362). A few\nexamples:\n\n Real neurons are much more heterogeneous\nthan the interchangeable nodes that figure in typical connectionist\nnetworks.\n Real neurons emit discrete spikes (action potentials) as\noutputs. But the nodes that figure in many prominent neural networks,\nincluding the best known deep neural networks, instead have continuous\noutputs.\n The backpropagation algorithm requires that weights between nodes\ncan vary between excitatory and inhibitory, yet actual synapses cannot\nso vary (Crick and Asanuma 1986). Moreover, the algorithm assumes\ntarget outputs supplied exogenously by modelers who know the\ndesired answer. In that sense, learning\nis supervised. Very little learning in actual biological\nsystems involves anything resembling supervised training.\n\n\nOn the other hand, some neural networks are more biologically\nrealistic (Buckner and Garson 2019; Illing, Gerstner, and Brea\n2019). For instance, there are neural networks that replace\nbackpropagation with more realistic learning algorithms, such as a\nreinforcement learning algorithm (Pozzi, Boht\u00e9, and Roelfsema\n2019, Other Internet Resources) or an unsupervised learning algorithm\n(Krotov and Hopfield 2019). There are also neural networks whose nodes\noutput discrete spikes roughly akin to those emitted by real neurons\nin the brain (Maass 1996; Buesing, Bill, Nessler, and Maass 2011).\nEven when a neural network is not biologically plausible, it may\nstill be more biologically plausible than classical\nmodels. Neural networks certainly seem closer than Turing-style\nmodels, in both details and spirit, to neurophysiological\ndescription. Many cognitive scientists worry that CCTM reflects a\nmisguided attempt at imposing the architecture of digital computers\nonto the brain. Some doubt that the brain implements anything\nresembling digital computation, i.e., computation over discrete\nconfigurations of digits (Piccinini and Bahar 2013). Others doubt that\nbrains display clean Turing-style separation between central processor\nand read/write memory (Dayan 2009). Neural networks fare better on\nboth scores: they do not require computation over discrete\nconfigurations of digits, and they do not postulate a clean separation\nbetween central processor and read/write memory.\nClassical computationalists typically reply that it is premature to\ndraw firm conclusions based upon biological plausibility, given how\nlittle we understand about the relation between neural, computational,\nand cognitive levels of description (Gallistel and King 2009; Marcus\n2001). Using measurement techniques such as cell recordings and\nfunctional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI), and drawing upon\ndisciplines as diverse as physics, biology, AI, information theory,\nstatistics, graph theory, and dynamical systems theory,\nneuroscientists have accumulated substantial knowledge about the brain\nat varying levels of granularity (Zednik 2019). We now know quite a\nlot about individual neurons, about how neurons interact within neural\npopulations, about the localization of mental activity in cortical\nregions (e.g. the visual cortex), and about interactions among\ncortical regions. Yet we still have a tremendous amount to learn about\nhow neural tissue accomplishes the tasks that it surely accomplishes:\nperception, reasoning, decision-making, language acquisition, and so\non. Given our present state of relative ignorance, it would be rash to\ninsist that the brain does not implement anything resembling Turing\ncomputation.\nConnectionists offer numerous further arguments that we should\nemploy connectionist models instead of, or in addition to, classical\nmodels.  See the entry connectionism\nfor an overview. For purposes of this entry, we mention two additional\narguments.\nThe first argument emphasizes learning (Bechtel and\nAbrahamsen 2002: 51). A vast range of cognitive phenomena involve\nlearning from experience. Many connectionist models are explicitly\ndesigned to model learning, through backpropagation or some other\nalgorithm that modifies the weights between nodes. By contrast,\nconnectionists often complain that there are no good classical models\nof learning. Classical computationalists can respond by citing\nperceived defects of connectionist learning algorithms (e.g., the\nheavy reliance of backpropagation upon supervised training). Classical\ncomputationalists can also cite Bayesian decision theory, which models\nlearning as probabilistic updating. More specifically, classical\ncomputationalists can cite the achievements of Bayesian cognitive\nscience, which uses Bayesian decision theory to construct\nmathematical models of mental activity (Ma 2019). Over the past few\ndecades, Bayesian cognitive science has accrued many explanatory\nsuccesses. This impressive track record suggests that some mental\nprocesses are Bayesian or approximately Bayesian (Rescorla\n2020). Moreover, the advances mentioned\nin \u00a72 show how classical computing systems\ncan execute or at least approximately execute Bayesian updating in\nvarious realistic scenarios. These developments provide hope that\nclassical computation can model many important cases of learning.\nThe second argument emphasizes speed of\ncomputation. Neurons are much slower than silicon-based\ncomponents of digital computers. For this reason, neurons could not\nexecute serial computation quickly enough to match rapid human\nperformance in perception, linguistic comprehension, decision-making,\netc. Connectionists maintain that the only viable solution is to\nreplace serial computation with a \u201cmassively parallel\u201d\ncomputational architecture\u2014precisely what neural networks\nprovide (Feldman and Ballard 1982; Rumelhart 1989). However, this\nargument is only effective against classical computationalists who\ninsist upon serial processing. As noted\nin \u00a73, some Turing-style models\ninvolve parallel processing. Many classical computationalists are\nhappy to allow \u201cmassively parallel\u201d mental computation,\nand the argument gains no traction against these researchers. That\nbeing said, the argument highlights an important question that any\ncomputationalist\u2014whether classical, connectionist, or\notherwise\u2014must address: How does a brain built from relatively\nslow neurons execute sophisticated computations so quickly? Neither\nclassical nor connectionist computationalists have answered this\nquestion satisfactorily (Gallistel and King 2009: 174 and 265).\n",
