    "main_text": "\n\nHuman behavior and thought often exhibit a familiar pattern of within\ngroup similarity and between group difference. Many of these patterns\nare attributed to cultural differences. For much of the history of its\ninvestigation into behavior and thought, however, cognitive science\nhas been disproportionately focused on uncovering and explaining the\nmore universal features of human minds\u2014or the universal features\nof minds in general.\n\nThis entry charts out the ways in which this has changed over recent\ndecades. It sketches the motivation behind the cultural turn in\ncognitive science, and situates some of its central findings with\nrespect to the questions that animate it and the debates that it has\ninspired. Woven throughout the entry are examples of how the cognitive\nscience of culture, and especially its elevated concern with different\nforms of diversity and variation, continues to influence and be\ninfluenced by philosophers.\n\nOne cluster of philosophical work falls within the traditional subject\nmatter of philosophy of science, in this case of the cognitive and\nsocial sciences. Philosophers have analyzed and assessed the methods\nand evidence central to the scientific study of cognition and culture,\nand have offered conceptual scrutiny, clarification, and synthesis.\nResearch in a second vein sees philosophers themselves contributing\nmore directly to cognitive scientific projects, (co)constructing\ntheories, helping build computational models, even gathering empirical\ndata. A third kind of work is naturalistic philosophy or philosophy of\nnature, wherein philosophers seek to use results from the cognitive\nscience of culture to inform or transform debates over long-standing\nphilosophical questions, including questions about the nature of\nphilosophy and philosophical methodology itself.\n",
