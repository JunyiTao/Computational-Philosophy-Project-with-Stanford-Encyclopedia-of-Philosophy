    "main_text": "George Campbell and the rhetorical tradition\n7. George Campbell and the rhetorical tradition\n\nA number of eighteenth century Scots, including James Burnett (Lord\nMonboddo), Adam Smith, Thomas Reid, Hugh Blair and James Dunbar, made\nsignificant contributions in the field of language and rhetoric.\nGeorge Campbell\u2019s The Philosophy of Rhetoric (London\n1776) is a large-scale essay in which he takes a roughly Aristotelian\nposition on the relation between logic and rhetoric, since he holds\nthat convincing an audience, which is the province of rhetoric or\neloquence, is a particular application of the logician\u2019s art.\nThe central insight from which Campbell is working is that the orator\nseeks to persuade people, and in general the best way to persuade is\nto produce perspicuous arguments. Good orators have to be good\nlogicians. Their grammar also must be sound. This double requirement\nof orators leads Campbell to make a sharp distinction between logic\nand grammar, on the grounds that though both have rules, the rules of\nlogic are universal and those of grammar particular. Though there are\nmany natural languages there is but one set of rules of logic, and on\nthe other hand different languages have different rules of grammar. It\nis against a background of discussion by prominent writers on language\nsuch as Locke and James (\u2018Hermes\u2019) Harris that Campbell\ntakes his stand with the claim that there cannot be such a thing as a\nuniversal grammar. His argument is that there cannot be a universal\ngrammar unless there is a universal language, and there is no such\nthing as a universal language, just many particular languages. There\nare, he grants, collections of rules that some have presented under\nthe heading \u2018universal grammar\u2019. But, protests, Campbell,\n\u201csuch collections convey the knowledge of no tongue\nwhatever\u201d. His position stands in interesting relation to\nReid\u2019s frequent appeals to universals of language in support of\nthe claim that given beliefs are held by all humankind.\n",
