    "main_text": "Jus in Bello || Necessity\n4.5 Necessity\n\nThe foregoing considerations are all also relevant to necessity. They\nallow us to weigh the harms at stake, so that we can determine whether\nthe morally weighted harm inflicted can be reduced at a reasonable\ncost to the agents. The basic structure of necessity is the same\nin bello as it is ad bellum, though obviously the\nsame differences in substance arise as for proportionality. Some\nreasons apply only to in bello necessity judgements, not to\nad bellum ones, because they are conditional on the\nbackground assumption that the war as a whole will continue. This\nmeans that we cannot reach judgements of the necessity of the war as a\nwhole by simply aggregating our judgements about the individual\nactions that together constitute the war.\n\nFor example, in bello one of the central questions when\napplying the necessity principle is: how much risk to our own troops\nare we required to bear in order to minimize harms to the innocent?\nSome option can be necessary simply in virtue of the fact that it\nsaves some of our combatants\u2019 lives. Ad bellum,\nevaluating the war as a whole, we must of course consider the risk to\nour own combatants. But we do so in a different way\u2014we ask\nwhether the goods achieved by the war as a whole will justify putting\nour combatants at risk. We don\u2019t then count among the goods\nachieved by the war the fact that multiple actions within the war will\nsave the lives of individual combatants. We cannot count averting\nthreats that will arise only if we decide to go to war among the goods\nthat justify the decision to go to war.\n\nThis relates directly to the largely ignored requirement in\ninternational law that combatants must \n\ntake all feasible precautions in the choice of means and methods of\nattack with a view to avoiding, and in any event to minimizing,\nincidental loss of civilian life, injury to civilians and damage to\ncivilian objects. (Geneva Convention, Article 57, 2(a)(ii))\n\n\nThis has deep moral foundations: combatants in war are morally\nrequired to reduce the risk to innocents until doing so\nfurther would involve an unreasonably high cost to them, which they\ncannot be required to bear. Working out when that point is reached\ninvolves thinking through: soldiers\u2019 role-obligations to assume\nrisks; the difference between doing harm to civilians and allowing it\nto happen to oneself or one\u2019s comrades-in-arms; the importance\nof associative duties to protect one\u2019s comrades; and all the\nconsiderations already adduced in favour of Moral Distinction. This\ncalculus is very hard to perform. My own view is that combatants ought\nto give significant priority to the lives of civilians (Walzer and\nMargalit 2009; McMahan 2010b). This is in stark contrast to existing\npractice (Luban 2014).\n",
