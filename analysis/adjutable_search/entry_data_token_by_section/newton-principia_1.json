    "main_text": "The Historical Context of the Principia\n2. The Historical Context of the Principia\n\n\nThe view is commonplace that what Newton did was to put forward his\ntheory of gravity to explain Kepler's already established \u201claws\u201d of\norbital motion; and the universality of the law of gravity then ended\nup explaining the deviations from Keplerian motion by attributing them\nto gravitational interaction of the planets. This is wrong on\nseveral counts, the most immediate of which is that Kepler's \u201claws\u201d\nwere by no means established before the Principia. The\nrules for calculating orbital motion that Kepler put forward in the\nfirst two decades of the seventeenth century had indeed achieved a\nspectacular gain in accuracy over anything that had come before.\nKepler's rules, however, did not yield comparable accuracy for the\nmotion of the Moon, and even in the case of the planets the calculated\nlocations were sometimes off by as much as a fourth of the width of the\nMoon. More importantly, by 1680 several other approaches to\ncalculating the orbits had been put forward that achieved the same\nlevel of not quite adequate accuracy as Kepler's. In particular,\nNewton was familiar with seven different approaches to calculating\nplanetary orbits, all at roughly the same accuracy. Only two of\nthese, Kepler's and Jeremiah Horrocks's, used Kepler's area rule \u2014\nplanets sweep out equal areas in equal times with respect to the Sun \u2014\nto locate planets along their trajectories. Isma\u00ebl Boulliau\nand, following him, Thomas Streete (from whose Astronomia\nCarolina Newton first learned orbital astronomy) replaced the area\nrule with a geometric construction. Vincent Wing had adopted\nstill another geometric construction in the late 1660s after having\nearlier used a point of equal angular motion oscillating about the\nempty focus of the ellipse; and Nicolaus Mercator in 1676 added still a\nfurther geometric\n construction.[4]\nOf these six alternative approaches, only\nHorrocks and, following him, Streete, took Kepler's 3/2 power rule \u2014\nthe periods of the planets vary as the square root of the cube of their\nmean distances from the Sun \u2014 seriously enough to use the periods\nrather than positional observations to determine their\nmean\n distances.[5]\n\n\nAll these approaches followed Kepler in using an ellipse to represent\nthe trajectory. (The primary historical reason for this was\nKepler's success in predicting the 1631 transit of Mercury across the\nSun.) This, however, does not mean that the ellipse was\nestablished as anything more than a mathematically tractable close\napproximation to the true orbit. In fact, the planetary orbits\nknown then are not all that elliptical. The minor axis of Mercury\nis only 2 percent shorter than the major axis, the minor axis of Mars,\nonly 0.4 percent shorter, and in all other cases the difference between\nan ellipse and an eccentric circle was beyond detection. Newton\nhad real grounds for claiming in a letter to Halley in June 1686 a\n\u201cright\u201d to the ellipse, remarking that \u201cKepler knew the Orb to be not\ncircular but oval, and guest it to be Elliptical\u201d [C,\nII, 436]. Entirely independently, the most judicious reader of the\nfirst edition of the Principia, Christiaan Huygens, wrote the\nfollowing summary of the Principia\u2018s achievement in his\nnotebook upon reading the complimentary copy Newton had sent him:\n\n\nThe famous M. Newton has brushed aside all the\ndifficulties together with the Cartesian vortices; he\nhas shown that the planets are retained in their orbits by their\ngravitation toward the Sun. And that the excentrics\nnecessarily become elliptical. [OH, XXI,\n143]\n\n\nSo, all three of Kepler's rules that came to be called \u201claws\u201d after\nthe Principia were known to be nothing more than holding to\nhigh approximation when Newton started on the project in 1684.\nAnd the leading issue in orbital astronomy at the time was not why\nKepler's rules hold, but rather which, if any, of the comparably\naccurate different approaches to calculating orbits was to be\npreferred.\n\n\nThe distinct possibility of the ellipse being only an approximation to\nthe true trajectory explains the appropriateness of the question Hooke\nput to Newton in 1679 and Halley put to him again in 1684 \u2014 what\ntrajectory does a body describe when moving under an inverse-square\nforce directed toward a central body? The inverse-square part of\nthis question came from combining the mathematical theory of uniform\ncircular motion, which Huygens had published in his Horologium\nOscillatorium of 1673, with Kepler's 3/2 power rule: the force in\na string retaining a body in a uniform circular orbit varies directly\nas the radius of the circle and inversely as the square of the period;\nbut the squares of the periods of the planets vary as the cubes of\ntheir mean distances; and hence, at least to a first approximation, the\nforces retaining the planets in their orbits vary inversely with the\nsquare of the radii of their nearly circular orbits. But now\nallow the distance of the orbiting body from the center to vary rather\nthan remaining constant, as in a circle. What trajectory would\nresult if the force toward the center varies as the inverse-square of\nthe distance from the center toward which the force is always\ndirected? The answer in the nine page tract \u201cDe Motu Corporum in\nGyrum\u201d that Newton sent to Halley in November 1684 is, an ellipse,\nprovided the velocity is not too high (and if it is, then instead a\nparabola or a hyperbola, depending on the velocity). The key step\nin developing this answer is a generalization of uniform circular\nmotion to the case of motion under a \u201ccentripetal\u201d force \u2014 a term\nNewton coined from Huygens's \u201ccentrifugal\u201d force, by which he meant the\ntension in the string keeping the body in a circle; and a key to this\nstep was the discovery that a body moving under any form of centripetal\nforce always sweeps out equal areas in equal times with respect to that\ncenter, so that the appropriate geometrical representation of time for\ngeneralizing uniform circular motion is area swept out rather than\nangle or arc length. The tract also confirms that Kepler's 3/2\npower rule continues to hold for bodies orbiting in confocal ellipses\ngoverned by inverse-square centripetal forces.\n\n\nThese were remarkable steps forward at the time, but they and the\nquestions behind them form only an initial part of the context in which\nNewton went on to write the Principia. Shortly after the\n\u201cDe Motu\u201d tract went off to London, Newton revised the tract and added\ntwo further passages. The question precipitating this revision\nappears to have been about the effect the inverse-square centripetal\nforces directed toward Jupiter, as implied by its satellites, have on\nthe Sun. Newton first added two principles that he first called\n\u201chypotheses\u201d and then changed to \u201claws\u201d:\n\n\n\n Law 3: The relative motions of\nbodies enclosed in a given space are the same whether that space is at\nrest or moves perpetually and uniformly in a straight line without\ncircular motion.\n\n\n Law 4: The common center of\ngravity does not alter its state of motion or rest through the mutual\nactions of bodies. [U, 267]\n\n\n\nThe second of the two added passages concerns motion in resisting\nmedia; it provides a context in which to read Book 2 of the\nPrincipia.\n\n\nThe first added passage, which has become known as the \u201cCopernican\nscholium,\u201d we here quote in full because it, better than anything else,\nexplains what led Newton into the further research that turned the\nnine-page tract into the five hundred page Principia. It\noccurs as a single long paragraph, but is here broken into three\nsegments in order to facilitate commenting on it:\n\n\n\n \nMoreover, the whole space of the\nplanetary heavens is either at rest (as is commonly believed) or\nuniformly moved in a straight line, and similarly the common\ncentre of gravity of the planets (by Law 4) is either at rest or is\nmoved at the same time. In either case the motions of the planets\namong themselves (by Law 3) take place in the same manner and\ntheir common centre of gravity is at rest with respect to the\nwhole space, and so it ought to be considered the immobile\ncenter of the whole planetary system. Thence indeed the\nCopernican system is proved a priori. For if a common\ncentre of gravity is computed for any position of the planets, this\neither lies in the body of the Sun or will always be very near\nit.\n\n \nBy reason of this deviation of the Sun\nfrom the center of gravity the centripetal force does not always tend\nto that immobile center, and hence the planets neither move exactly in\nellipses nor revolve twice in the same orbit. Each time a planet\nrevolves it traces a fresh orbit, as happens also with the motion of\nthe Moon, and each orbit depends upon the combined motions of all the\nplanets, not to mention their actions upon each other. Unless I\nam much mistaken, it would exceed the force of human wit to\nconsider so many causes of motion at the same time, and to define\nthe motions by exact laws which would allow of an easy\ncalculation.\n\n \nLeaving aside these fine points, the simple\norbit that is the mean between all vagaries will be the ellipse that I\nhave discussed already. If any one shall attempt to\ndetermine this ellipse by trigonometrical computation from three\nobservations (as is usual) he will be proceeding without due\ncaution. For these observations will share in the very small\nirregular motions here neglected and so cause the ellipse to deviate\nsomewhat from its actual magnitude and position (which ought to be the\nmean among all errors), and so there will be as many ellipses differing\nfrom each other as there are trios of observations employed. Very\nmany observations must therefore be joined together and assigned to a\nsingle operation which mutually moderate each other and display the\nmean ellipse both as regards position and magnitude.\n[U, 280]\n\n\n\nThe first segment highlights a further component of the historical\ncontext in which the Principia was written and read.\nGalileo's discovery of the phases of Venus in 1613 had provided\ndecisive evidence against the Ptolemaic\n system,[6]\nbut it could not provide grounds\nfavoring the Copernican over the Tychonic system. In the latter,\nMercury, Venus, Mars, Jupiter and Saturn circumnavigate the Sun, and\nthe Sun circumnavigates the Earth, with the consequence that these\nseven bodies are at all times in the same position in relation to one\nanother as they are in the Copernican system. Whether any\ndecisive empirical grounds could be found favoring the Copernican over\nthe Tychonic system became one of the most celebrated issues of the\nseventeenth century. Kepler, Galileo, and Descartes all published\nmajor books in the first half of the century purporting to resolve\nthis\n issue,[7]\nKepler and\nDescartes basing their arguments on the physical mechanism each had\nproposed as governing the orbital motion. Nevertheless, the\nleading observational astronomer of the second half of the century, G.\nD. Cassini, was a Tychonist. In the first segment of the\n\u201cCopernican Scholium\u201d Newton identifies the center of gravity of the\nplanetary system as the appropriate point to which all the motion\nshould be referred \u2014 the technical issue behind the issue over the two\nsystems \u2014 and then announces that the centripetal forces identified in\nthe text of \u201cDe Motu\u201d as governing the orbital motion open the way to\nestablishing a slightly qualified form of the Copernican\n system.[8]\nNewton's\ndiscovery of this line of reasoning was surely a major factor urging\nhim on to the Principia.\n\n\nThe second segment of the \u201cCopernican Scholium\u201d addresses an issue in\norbital astronomy that forms a still further component in the\nhistorical context of the Principia. Separate from the\nquestion whether Kepler's or some other approach was to be preferred\nwas the question whether the true motions are significantly more\nirregular and complicated than the calculated motions in any of these\napproaches. The complexity of the lunar orbit and the continuing\nfailure to describe it within the accuracy Kepler had achieved for the\nplanets was one consideration lying behind this question. Another\ncame from Kepler's own finding, noted in the Preface to his\n Rudolphine Tables[9]\nand subsequently supported by others, that the\ntrue motions may involve further vagaries, as evidenced by apparent\nchanges in the values of orbital elements over time. The most\nimportant consideration behind this question, however, came from\nDescartes' claim that, in keeping with the changing motions of his\nvortices over long periods of time, the orbits are not mathematically\nperfect and \u201cthey are continuously changed by the passing of the ages\u201d\n[D, 3, 34]. In the second segment of the quoted\nScholium, Newton concludes that, in contrast to the ellipse that\nanswered the mathematical question put to him by Hooke and Halley, the\ntrue orbits are not ellipses, but are indeed indefinitely\ncomplex. This conclusion is nowhere so forcefully stated in the\npublished Principia, but knowledgeable readers nonetheless saw\nthe work as answering the question whether the true motions are\nmathematically perfect in the negative.\n\n\nFinally, the second and third segments together not only point out that\nKeplerian motion is only an approximation to the true motions, but they\ncall attention to the potential pitfalls in using the orbits published\nby Kepler and others as evidence for claims about the planetary\nsystem. For example, if the true motions are so complicated, then\nit is not surprising that all the different calculational approaches\nwere achieving comparable accuracy, for all of them at best hold only\napproximately. Equally, the success in calculating the orbits\ncould not serve as a basis to argue against Cartesian vortices, for the\nirregularities entailed by them could not simply be dismissed.\nThe spectre raised was the very one Newton had objected to during the\ncontroversy over his earlier light and color papers: too many\nhypotheses could be made to fit the same\n data.[10]\nWorse, the multiplicity\nof tenable hypotheses was a spectre haunting mathematical astronomy as\na discipline from the end of the sixteenth century\n forward.[11]\nSo, the\nconclusion that calculated orbits can at most be mere approximations\nwould have been seen as raising the possibility that truth and\nexactness were beyond the reach of mathematical astronomy. The\nmain reason why the Principia includes so much beyond the \u201cDe\nMotu\u201d tract is Newton's endeavor to reach conclusions that had claim to\nbeing exact and true in spite of the inordinate complexities of the\nactual motions.\n\n\nThe historical context in which Newton wrote the Principia\ninvolved a set of issues that readers of the first edition saw it as\naddressing: Was Kepler's approach to calculating the orbits, or some\nother, to be preferred? Was there some empirical basis for\nresolving the issue of the Copernican versus the Tychonic system?\nWere the true motions complicated and irregular versus the calculated\nmotions? Can mathematical astronomy be an exact science? No\nreader of the Principia at the time had the benefit of seeing\nhow Newton had these questions tied together in the \u201cCopernican\nScholium\u201d because it did not appear in print until two hundred\nyears\n later.[12]\nNothing, however, brings out more clearly the extent to which the\nexpanded scope of the Principia stemmed from Newton's\npreoccupation with the problem of reaching conclusions that had claim\nto being exact from evidence that, by his reckoning, held at best to\nhigh approximation. This is why the \u201cCopernican scholium\u201d\nprovides the most illuminating context for reading the\nPrincipia. Equally, its being unknown for so long helps\nto explain why the Principia has generally been read so\nsimplistically.\n",
