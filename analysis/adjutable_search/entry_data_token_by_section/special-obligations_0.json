    "main_text": "Special Obligations and Consequentialism\n1. Special Obligations and Consequentialism\n\nWhat is special about special obligations? One way to answer\nthis question is to contrast special obligations with some type of\nduty or obligation that is not special. One example of such a\n\u2018non-special\u2019 type of duty or obligation is that\nrecognized by consequentialists. (Special obligations can also be\ncontrasted with another type of non-special duty. See section III).\nAccording to one version of consequentialism, the right action is that\naction which, of all alternatives available to the agent, produces the\ngreatest net sum of intrinsic value, where intrinsic value is value as\nan end or for its own sake and not merely as a means to something\nother than itself. (There are, of course, many forms of\nconsequentialism. The important feature of such views for our purposes\nis that they understand right action as a function of and solely of\nthe consequences (actual, probable, or possible) of the action and its\nalternatives. (The following discussion presupposes a version of\nactual consequence act-consequentialism. But the points made apply\nmutatis mutandis to other versions of consequentialism.)\n\nBut now consider how, according to the consequentialist, I ought to\ntreat my friends (or family members, or colleagues, \u2026). If my\nfriend\u2019s well-being is no more intrinsically valuable than the\nwell-being of any other person, then I ought to be impartial, at least\nin my actions, between promoting the good of my friend and promoting\nthe good of a complete stranger. Thus, the mere fact that someone is\nmy friend (or my mother, or my colleague, or my fellow citizen) does\nnot imply that I have any obligations to such a person that I do not\nhave to any and all persons. Similarly, the mere fact that I have\npromised someone to benefit her in some way does not, considered in\nitself, imply that I have any obligation to benefit that person: my\npromisee\u2019s good carries no greater weight than does the good of\nany other person. On the other hand, commonsense morality, in contrast\nwith consequentialism, seems to regard the mere fact that a person is\nmy friend or that I made a promise to that person as morally\nsignificant. For example, most people do not think that I am justified\nin breaking a promise merely because slightly more good would result\nfrom my breaking the promise than from my keeping the promise.\nSimilarly, most people think that if I have a choice between\nbenefitting a friend or providing an equal benefit to a stranger that\nI ought to benefit my friend. Consequentialism, in so far as it\ndiverges from commonsense morality on these points, strikes many as an\nunacceptable moral theory.\n\nOf course, the consequentialist has more than one possible reply to\nthese sorts of worries about her view. First, the consequentialist can\nargue that, in fact, each person acting so as to benefit her friends,\nloved ones, promisees, etc., will have the best overall consequences.\nPromising, for example, is an instrumentally valuable institution, and\neach of us should do her part to support that institution: one thing\nthat each of us can do is to keep her own promises. Promises also\ncreate expectations in their recipients, and the harm of unrealized\nexpectations or hopes needs to be taken into account when we consider\nwhether the breaking of a promise has better consequences than the\nkeeping of a promise. Similarly, each of us ought to take special care\nof her loved ones, because friendship is a valuable institution. Also,\nwe are well positioned to take care of our loved ones: our efforts are\nmore likely to be efficacious than if we were to attempt to benefit\npersons distant from us whom we do not know and people often\nexperience greater emotional harm when they are slighted by their\nintimates than when they are slighted by strangers. As John Stuart\nMill remarked in Utilitarianism, \u201c[f]ew hurts which human beings\ncan sustain are greater, and none wound more, than when that on which\nthey habitually and with full assurance relied fails them in the hour\nof need\u201d (59).\n\nIn The Methods of Ethics, Henry Sidgwick appealed to the\nconsiderations mentioned in the previous paragraph in an attempt\n\u201cto show that the commonly received view of special claims and\nduties arising out of special relations, though prima facie\nopposed to the impartial universality of the Utilitarian principle, is\nreally maintained by a well-considered application of that\nprinciple\u201d (439). Our \u2018natural benevolent\naffections\u2019 guide us to do good toward some small sector of\nhumankind (a small sector composed of our friends, promisees,\ncolleagues, family, etc.), and stifling such natural tendencies would\nleave only \u201ca very feeble counterpoise to self-love\u201d and\nthus little from which to develop a more extended and generalized\nbenevolence (434). Also, given the naturalness of certain affections,\nwe come to expect others to act on them, and so pain is caused by\ndeviations from these expectations (439). Thus, consequentialists have\nfor a long time been aware of the apparently counterintuitive\nimplications of their theory with respect to special obligations and\nbeen at pains to show that such implications are merely apparent.\n\nThis move, however, does not accommodate genuinely special\nobligations within a consequentialist view. The consequentialist\njustification for an agent\u2019s giving greater attention to the\nwell-being of her intimates is that her doing so will best promote\nintrinsic value. The reason that each of us has to promote the good of\nher intimates does not have any weight that counters the weight of our\nduty to maximize intrinsic value; rather, whatever weight our reason\nto promote the good of our intimates has, it has derivatively\nas a means of our fulfilling our fundamental or basic duty to maximize\nvalue. Whenever we can maximize value by ignoring our intimates or by\nbreaking a promise, then we, in such circumstances, have no even\nprima facie reasons to take care of our intimates or to keep\nour promises. Thus, on this account, the consequentialist secures only\nderivatively special obligations: reasons to take special\ncare of a select group of people that are derived from a more\ngeneral duty to care for all persons as such. Each agent has the same\nfundamental duty or reason to maximize value, but each of us, given\nour unique causal and epistemic position, ought to perform different\nactions in order to be fulfilling that fundamental shared duty.\n\nBut then, of course, whatever derivative reason an agent has to care\nfor her intimates is determined by the nature of her contingent,\nempirical circumstances. If I find myself causally and epistemically\npositioned to do greater good by ignoring my intimates and serving the\nneeds of strangers, then that is what I ought to do, according to the\nconsequentialist. In fact, if I have the choice of providing\nx units of good to my friend or x+1 units of good to\na complete stranger, then, barring any further long-run negative\neffects on my character, my friendship, or the institution of\nfriendship, I ought to provide the x+1 units of good to the\nstranger. Commonsense morality, however, as we have seen, regards the\nfact of my standing in the friendship relation to someone as morally\nsignificant in and of itself. In so far as the consequentialist is\nunable to grant friendship (or promising, etc.) any such independent\nmoral significance, it remains out of step with commonsense\nunderstanding of the status of special obligations.\n\nAnother move that the consequentialist can make is to claim that each\nperson taking care of her own intimates (or keeping her own promises)\nis an intrinsically valuable state of affairs. And my taking\ncare of my intimates is an essential part of this intrinsically\nvaluable state of affairs: it is not merely a contingent matter that\nI, rather than others, am better placed to promote it. Thus, it seems\nthat I have reason to take care of my intimates that no one else has,\nand I have no similar reason to take care of persons other than my\nintimates. But this too is only a derivatively special obligation: it\nis derived from the fundamental duty to maximize value. If I can\nproduce more value by promoting your taking care of\nyour intimates than by taking care of my own, then I ought to\ndo the former rather than the latter. Perhaps your intimate\nrelationships are more valuable than my own, and I could promote more\ngood by devoting myself to helping you to maintain your relationships\nto family, friends, colleagues, and promisees. In such circumstances,\nI ought to devote my resources to promoting your devotion to your\nintimates. My reason to pay special attention to certain persons\nprovides no independent counter-weight to my reason to maximize\noverall value: I must be, at bottom, impartial, at least in action, as\nbetween my own intimate relationships (or my own promises) and anyone\nelse\u2019s intimate relationships (or promises).\n\nPeter Railton has argued that a \u2018sophisticated\nconsequentialist\u2019 agent has reason to cultivate in himself\nmotivational dispositions that support the kinds of partiality that\ncommonsense views as necessary for friendship and other intimate\nrelationships. If moral agents were inclined to reason as\nstraightforward consequentialists, they would be unable to form\nloving, intimate relationships. Given the value of such relationships,\nagents will, in the long run, produce more overall good if they\ndispose themselves to benefit loved ones, even if such dispositions\nlead them, on occasion, to perform an action with less than optimal\nconsequences. Thus, good consequentialist agents are ones who guide\nthemselves to act as though they had special obligations to friends\nand other loved ones. (See Driver for an attempt to show how\nconsequentialism is not in tension with feminist concerns about\n\u201cpartiality and the demands of morality\u201d (197).)\n\nThe difficulty with Railton\u2019s strategy is in its ultimate\nevaluation of the action of a sophisticated consequentialist agent on\nthe occasion when he acts to benefit a loved one even though the\nconsequences of doing so are slightly less good than if he had acted\nto benefit a stranger instead. As Richard J. Arneson says, according\nto the sophisticated consequentialist, \u201cit can be morally right\nto form the intention to do what is morally wrong \u2026 Sometimes\none ought to become a friend, even though this involves disposing\noneself to do wrong, because forming this disposition would be acting\nto produce best consequences\u201d (394). Arneson is quite right to\npoint out that such a claim does not involve the consequentialist in\nany \u201cparadox or inconsistency\u201d (394). However, most people\nare reluctant to view friendship and the dispositions that it involves\nas inevitably an arena of wrongdoing, albeit blameless wrongdoing. If\nthis is the best that consequentialism can do for our reasons to take\nspecial care of friends and of loved ones \u2014 labeling such action\nas wrongdoing that is a byproduct of otherwise instrumentally valuable\ndispositions \u2014 then it seems that consequentialism simply cannot\ncapture our deep-rooted sense of our obligations arising from special\nrelationships.
