First Wave Feminist Analyses of Women and Work\n\nThose feminist analyses which have highlighted the role of\nwomen\u2019s work in the social construction of gender and the\nperpetuation of male dominance have been termed liberal, radical,\nMarxist, and socialist feminism by such influential categorizers as\nJaggar and Rothenberg [Struhl] (1978), Tong (2000), Barrett (1980),\nJaggar (1983) and Walby\n (1990)[2].\n However, the pigeonhole categories of liberal, radical, Marxist, or\nsocialist categories apply poorly to both to first wave women\u2019s\nmovement feminist predecessors and contemporary deconstructionist,\npost-structuralist and post-colonialist perspectives.\n\nA number of first wave feminists write about work and class as key\nissues for women\u2019s liberation, such as socialist-feminist\nCharlotte Perkins Gilman, heavily influenced by Darwinism and\n19th century utopian modernism (Gilman 1898, 1910, 1979),\nanarchist Emma Goldman (1969), and existentialist, radical feminist\nand Marxist of sorts Simone de Beauvoir (1952). This is because the\ndebates that arose around the place of the women\u2019s movement in\nclass politics were different in the early and mid-twentieth century\nthan they were in the 1960s when many feminist theorists were trying\nto define themselves independently of the left anti-Vietnam war and\ncivil rights movements of the time.\n\nThe debate about the economic and social function of housework and its\nrelation to women\u2019s oppression is an old one that has been a\nfeature of both the first and second wave women\u2019s movements in\nthe US, Britain and Europe. In both eras, the underlying issue is how\nto handle the public/private split of capitalist societies in which\nwomen\u2019s reproductive functions have either limited their work to\nthe home or created a \u201csecond shift\u201d problem of unpaid\nhousework and childcare as well as waged work. In the first wave,\nlocated as it was in the Victorian period where the dominant ideology\nfor middle and upper class women was purity, piety and domesticity\n(also called the \u201ccult of true womanhood\u201d), the debate\ncentered on whether to keep housework in the private sphere yet make\nit more scientific and efficient (Beecher 1841; Richards 1915 ), or\nwhether to \u201csocialize\u201d it by bringing it into the public\nsphere, as socialist Charlotte Perkins Gilman advocated (1898).\n\nIn the US, the \u201cpublic housekeeping\u201d aspect of the\nProgressive movement of the 1890s through early 1900s advocated that\nwomen bring the positive values associated with motherhood into the\npublic sphere \u2014 by obtaining the vote, cleaning out corruption\nin politics, creating settlement houses to educate and support\nimmigrants, and forming the women\u2019s peace movement, etc. (cf.\nJane Addams 1914). Disagreements about whether to downplay or valorize\nthe distinctive function and skills in motherhood as work for which\nwomen are naturally superior, or to see motherhood as restricting\nwomen\u2019s chances for economic independence and equality with men\nin the public sphere, were also evident in debates between Ellen Keys\n(1909, 1914) and Gilman. Keys represented the difference side, that\nwomen are superior humans because of mothering; while Gilman and\nGoldman took the equality side of the debate, that is, that, women are\nrestricted, and made socially unequal to men, by unpaid housework and\n mothering[3].\n",
