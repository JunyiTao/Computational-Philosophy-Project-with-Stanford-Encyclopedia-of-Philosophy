    "main_text": "\n\nPragmatist feminism is a developing field of philosophy that emerged\nin the 1990s as a new approach to feminist philosophy. It utilizes and\nintegrates core concepts of pragmatism, including its emphasis on\npluralism, lived experience and public philosophy, with feminist\ntheory and practice with a focus on social change. Pragmatist feminist\nphilosophers have been addressing several different projects over the\npast decades, including a) the recovery of women who were influential\nin the development of American pragmatism but whose work subsequently\nall but disappeared in the history of philosophy, b) a rereading of\nthe \u201ccanon\u201d of pragmatist philosophers, analyzing their\nwriting in light of their philosophies and attitudes about women, and\nc) the utilization of pragmatist philosophies as a resource for\ncontemporary feminist philosophy and activism. The late\n20th century saw a resurgence of interest in American\npragmatist philosophy, and part of the energy of that resurgence was\ndue to feminist interest in pragmatism. Twenty-first century feminist\nphilosophers are incorporating a wider vision of American and global\nactivism into the pragmatist-feminist dialogue.\n\nWhat is now called \u201cclassical\u201d American pragmatism is a\ngrouping of philosophies that developed between the late nineteenth\nand the early twentieth century and were largely influential from the\nProgressive Era (1890\u20131915) up until the Second World War.\nPragmatists, such as John Dewey, William James, and Jane Addams, were\ninterested in the intersection of theory and practice, bringing\nphilosophical thinking into relationship with the social and political\nenvironment. For these thinkers, philosophizing was an active process,\nboth as a way to change social realities and to use experience to\nmodify the philosophies themselves. Early pragmatists were often\nhumanists; they saw the social environment as malleable, capable of\nimprovement through human action and philosophic thought. Because of\nthis, many of the classical pragmatists were engaged in social action,\noften participating in experiments in education and working for\negalitarian social reforms. Both early and contemporary pragmatists\nreject the idea of a certain Truth that can be discovered through\nlogical analysis or revelation and are more interested in knowledge\ngained through experiences of all sorts, while emphasizing the social\ncontext of all epistemological claims. Pluralism is a central value\nfor pragmatists, who understand that knowledge is shaped by multiple\nexperiential viewpoints. As such, women\u2019s experiences are an\nessential part of pragmatist philosophy. \n\nThe weaving together of feminism and pragmatism situates social and\npolitical issues in historical, geographic and relational contexts and\nparticularly addresses systems of oppression that have marginalized\nthe voices of women and people of color.  Biographical and theoretical\napproaches illuminate the connections between feminism and pragmatism\nas activist-orientated philosophies. These efforts are consistent with\nfeminist methodology; they utilize personal experiences as well as\ntheoretical work that focuses on embodied living in a social organism\nto address contemporary feminist social and political concerns.\n\nBoth feminism and pragmatism are fields that extend beyond the\nboundaries of traditional philosophy. Some early pragmatist feminists\nworked in areas that are now considered social science fields. Looking\nbeyond academic philosophy to find the women who were influential\nsocial philosophers has expanded traditional philosophical methodology\nand has opened a a \u201cnew space for thinking\u201d in\nphilosophy. Understanding these reformers as philosophers helps us see\nhow those outside of modern, professional, academic settings\ndeveloped, expressed, and enacted groundbreaking theories and can\nilluminate how philosophers today might span the boundaries between\nscholarship and activism, between philosophy and other disciplines,\nand between the academy and the community.\n\nMany of the historical women discussed here did not call themselves\npragmatists but contemporary scholars and activists rely on their\nphilosophies in a renewed emphasis on public and engaged philosophy in\nthe pragmatist tradition (Lake 2014; Hamington & Bardwell-Jones\n2012; Yun Lee 2011). This entry will first consider the influence of\nparticular women in the classical pragmatist era, then highlight\nfeminist rereadings of classical pragmatist work, describing how\ncontemporary pragmatist feminist philosophers are drawing upon the\nwork of early pragmatist feminist writers in order to pursue projects\nwithin epistemology, education, social action, and democratic\npluralism. Finally, this entry will briefly consider emerging\ncontemporary scholarship from global pragmatist feminist. \n",
