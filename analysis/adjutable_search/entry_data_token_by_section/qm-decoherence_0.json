    "main_text": "Theory of Decoherence\n1. Theory of Decoherence\n\nThe two-slit experiment is a paradigm example of an\ninterference experiment. One repeatedly sends electrons or\nother particles through a screen with two narrow slits, the electrons\nimpinge upon a second screen, and we ask for the probability\ndistribution of detections over the surface of the screen. One might\nnaively try to calculate them by summing over the probabilities of\ndetection at the slits multiplied by the probabilities for detection\nat the screen conditional on detection at the slits. But these are the\ncorrect probabilities for a different experiment, with\ndetections at the slits, whether or not we believe that measurements\nare related to a \u2018true\u2019 collapse of the wave function\n(i.e. that only one of the components survives the\nmeasurement and proceeds to hit the\n screen[2]).\n If there are no such detections, in general there is an additional\nso-called interference term in the correct expression for the\nprobability, and this term depends on both the wave\ncomponents that pass through the\n slits.[3]\n\n\nThere are, however, situations in which this interference term does\nnot appear or is negligible, and the naive formula applies. This is\nthe case if some other systems interact with the electron between the\nslits and the screen, leading to enough\n entanglement\n with the components of the wave going through the two slits. Then,\nthe probabilities of detection at the screen are as if we had\nperformed a detection at the slits.\n\nIt is not difficult to see why this must be so. If Alice and Bob share\na pair of systems that are entangled, then the probabilities for the\nresults of any measurements Bob might make do not depend on\nwhether or not Alice also makes any measurements (this is the quantum\nmechanical no-signalling theorem). In exactly the same way, the\npattern of detections at the screen cannot distinguish mere\nentanglement with some other systems from the actual use of those\nsystems for detection at the slits.\n\nSo, for example, there could be sufficiently many stray particles that\nscatter off the\n electron.[4]\n The phase relation between the two components of the wave function,\nwhich is responsible for interference, is now well-defined only at the\nlevel of the larger system composed of electron and stray particles,\nand can produce interference only in a suitable experiment including\nthe larger system. Such a phenomenon of suppression of interference is\nwhat is called decoherence.\n",
