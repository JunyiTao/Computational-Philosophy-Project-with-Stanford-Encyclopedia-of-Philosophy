    "main_text": "Aristotle || Non-modal Syllogistic\n2.4 Non-modal Syllogistic\n\n\nAristotle\u2019s non-modal syllogistic (Prior Analytics A\n1\u20137) is the pinnacle of his logic. Aristotle defines a syllogism\nas \u2018an argument (logos) in which, certain things having\nbeen laid down, something different from what has been laid down\nfollows of necessity because these things are so\u2019. This\ndefinition appears to require (i) that a syllogism consists of at\nleast two premises and a conclusion, (ii) that the conclusion follows\nof necessity from the premises (so that all syllogisms are\nvalid arguments), and (iii) that the conclusion differs from\nthe premises. Aristotle\u2019s syllogistic covers only a small part of all\narguments that satisfy these conditions.\n\n\nAristotle restricts and regiments the types of categorical sentence\nthat may feature in a syllogism. The admissible truth-bearers are now\ndefined as each containing two different terms (horoi)\nconjoined by the copula, of which one (the predicate term) is said of\nthe other (the subject term) either affirmatively or negatively.\nAristotle never comes clear on the question whether terms are things\n(e.g., non-empty classes) or linguistic expressions for these things.\nOnly universal and particular sentences are discussed. Singular\nsentences seem to be excluded and indefinite sentences are mostly\nignored. At An. Pr. A 7 Aristotle mentions that by substituting an\nindefinite premise for a particular, one obtains a syllogism of\nthe same kind.\n\n\nAnother innovation in the syllogistic is Aristotle\u2019s use of letters in\nplace of terms. The letters may originally have served simply as\nabbreviations for terms (e.g. An. Post. A 13); but in the\nsyllogistic they seem mostly to have the function either of schematic\nterm letters or of term variables with universal quantifiers assumed\nbut not stated. Where he uses letters, Aristotle tends to express the\nfour types of categorical sentences in the following way (with common\nlater abbreviations in parentheses):\n\n\n\u2018A holds of (lit., belongs to) every\nB\u2019\n(AaB)\n\n\n\u2018A holds of no B\u2019\n(AeB)\n\n\n\u2018A holds of some B\u2019\n(AiB)\n\n\n\u2018A does not hold of some B\u2019\n(AoB)\n\n\n\n\nInstead of \u2018holds\u2019 he also uses \u2018is\npredicated\u2019.\n\n\nAll basic syllogisms consist of three categorical sentences, in which\nthe two premises share exactly one term, called the middle term, and\nthe conclusion contains the other two terms, sometimes called the\nextremes. Based on the position of the middle term, Aristotle\nclassified all possible premise combinations into three figures\n(sch\u00eamata): the first figure has the middle term (B)\nas subject in the first premise and predicated in the second; the\nsecond figure has it predicated in both premises, the third has it as\nsubject in both premises:\n\n\nI\nII\nIII\n\n\nA holds of B\nB holds of A\nA holds of B\n\n\nB holds of C\nB holds of C\nC holds of B\n\n\n\nA is also called the major term, C the minor\nterm. Each figure can further be classified according to whether or\nnot both premises are universal. Aristotle went systematically through\nthe fifty-eight possible premise combinations and showed that fourteen\nhave a conclusion following of necessity from them, i.e. are\nsyllogisms. His procedure was this: He assumed that the syllogisms of\nthe first figure are complete and not in need of proof, since they are\nevident. By contrast, the syllogisms of the second and third figures\nare incomplete and in need of proof. He proves them by reducing them\nto syllogisms of the first figure and thereby \u2018completing\u2019\nthem. For this he makes use of three methods:\n\nconversion (antistroph\u00ea): a categorical sentence is\nconverted by interchanging its terms. Aristotle recognizes and\nestablishes three conversion rules: \u2018from AeB\ninfer BeA\u2019; \u2018from AiB\ninfer BiA\u2019 and \u2018from\nAaB infer BiA\u2019. All but two\nsecond and third figure syllogisms can be proved by premise\nconversion.\nreductio ad impossibile (apag\u00f4g\u00ea):\nthe remaining two are proved by reduction to the impossible, where the\ncontradictory of an assumed conclusion together with one of the\npremises is used to deduce by a first figure syllogism a conclusion\nthat is incompatible with the other premise. Using the semantic\nrelations between opposites established earlier the assumed conclusion\nis thus established.\nexposition or setting-out (ekthesis): this method, which\nAristotle uses in addition to (i) and (ii), involves choosing or\n\u2018setting out\u2019 some additional term, say D, that\nfalls in the non-empty intersection delimited by two premises,\nsay AxB and AxC,\nand using D to justify the inference from the premises to a\nparticular conclusion, BxC. It is debated\nwhether \u2018D\u2019 represents a singular or a general\nterm and whether exposition constitutes proof.\n\n\n\nFor each of the thirty-four premise combinations that allow no\nconclusion Aristotle proves by counterexample that they allow no\nconclusion. As his overall result, he acknowledges four first figure\nsyllogisms (later named Barbara, Celarent, Darii, Ferio), four second\nfigure syllogisms (Camestres, Cesare, Festino, Baroco) and six third\nfigure syllogisms (Darapti, Felapton, Disamis, Datisi, Bocardo,\nFerison); these were later called the modes or moods of the figures.\n(The names are mnemonics: e.g. each vowel, or the first three in cases\nwhere the name has more than three, indicates in order whether the\nfirst and second premises and the conclusion were sentences of type\na, e, i or o.) Aristotle\nimplicitly recognized that by using the conversion rules on the\nconclusions we obtain eight further syllogisms (An. Pr.\n53a3\u201314), and that of the premise combinations rejected as\nnon-syllogistic, some (five, in fact) will yield a conclusion in which\nthe minor term is predicated of the major (An. Pr.\n29a19\u201327). Moreover, in the Topics Aristotle accepted\nthe rules \u2018from AaB infer\nAiB\u2019 and \u2018from AeB\ninfer AoB\u2019. By using these on the conclusions\nfive further syllogisms could be proved, though Aristotle did not\nmention this.\n\n\nGoing beyond his basic syllogistic, Aristotle reduced the\n3rd and 4th first figure syllogisms to second\nfigure syllogisms, thus de facto reducing all syllogisms to\nBarbara and Celarent; and later on in the Prior Analytics he\ninvokes a type of cut-rule by which a multi-premise syllogism can be\nreduced to two or more basic syllogisms. From a modern perspective,\nAristotle\u2019s system can be understood as a sequent logic in the style\nof natural deduction and as a fragment of first-order logic. It has\nbeen shown to be sound and complete if one interprets the relations\nexpressed by the categorical sentences set-theoretically as a system\nof non-empty classes as follows: AaB is true if and\nonly if the class A contains the class\nB. AeB is true if and only if the classes\nA and B are disjoint. AiB is true\nif and only if the classes A and B are not\ndisjoint. AoB is true if and only if the class\nA does not contain the class B. It is generally\nagreed, though, that Aristotle\u2019s syllogistic is a kind of relevance\nlogic rather than classical. The vexing textual question what exactly\nAristotle meant by \u2018syllogisms\u2019 has received several rival\ninterpretations, including one that they are a certain type of\nconditional propositional form. Most plausibly, perhaps, Aristotle\u2019s\ncomplete and incomplete syllogisms taken together should be\nunderstood as formally valid premise-conclusion arguments; and his\ncomplete and completed syllogisms taken together as (sound)\ndeductions.\n",
