    "main_text": "Mind-Independent Existence\n2. Mind-Independent Existence\n\nWhy do some find the notion of mind-independent existence inadequate\nfor the task of formulating metaphysical realism? The most common\ncomplaint is that the notion is either obscure, or, more strongly,\nincoherent or cognitively meaningless. An eloquent spokesman for this\nstrong view was Rudolf Carnap: \u201cMy friends and I have maintained\nthe following theses,\u201d Carnap announces [Carnap 1963,\np.868]:\n\n(1) The statement asserting the reality of the external world\n(realism) as well as its negation in various forms, e.g. solipsism and\nseveral forms of idealism, in the traditional controversy are\npseudo-statements, i.e., devoid of cognitive content. (2) The\nsame holds for the statements about the reality or irreality of\nother minds (3) and for the statements of the reality or\nirreality of abstract entities (realism of universals or\nPlatonism, vs. nominalism).\n\n\nIn spite of his finding these disputes meaningless, Carnap indicates\nhow he thinks we could reconstruct them (sic.) so as to make some\nsense of them: if we were to \u201creplace the ontological theses\nabout the reality or irreality of certain entities, theses which we\nregard as pseudo-theses, by proposals or decisions concerning the use\nof certain languages. Thus realism is replaced by the practical\ndecision to use the reistic language\u201d.\n\nCarnap does not have in mind a factualist reformulation of\nmetaphysical realism here\u2014his \u201creistic\u201d language is\nstrictly limited to the description of \u201cintersubjectively\nobservable, spatio-temporally localized things or events\u201d.\n\nWhat matters here is not Carnap\u2019s sense of a commensurability\nbetween a metaphysical thesis about reality and a practical decision\nto speak only about observable things, but rather that he thinks he\ncan explain how the illusion of meaningfulness arises for the\nmetaphysical theses he declares \u201cdevoid of cognitive\ncontent\u201d. His explanation has to do with a distinction between\ntwo types of questions \u2014 internal and external\nquestions: \n\nAn existential statement which asserts that there are entities of a\nspecified kind can be formulated as a simple existential statement in\na language containing variables for these entities. I have called\nexistential statements of this kind, formulated within a\ngiven language, internal existential statements. [Carnap\n1963, p. 871]\n\n\nWhereas internal questions about the existence of physical objects are\nto be answered by observations that confirm or disconfirm sentences\nasserting their existence, existential statements about abstract\nobjects are analytic, Carnap contends:\n\nJust because internal statements are usually analytic and trivial, we\nmay presume that the theses involved in the traditional philosophical\ncontroversies are not meant as internal statements, but rather as\nexternal existential statements; they purport to assert the\nexistence of entities of the kind in question not merely within a\ngiven language, but, so to speak, before a language has been\nconstructed. [1963, p. 871]\n\n\nHaving dismissed all external existential questions as devoid of\ncognitive content, Carnap decides that both realism which asserts the\nontological reality of abstract entities and nominalism which asserts\ntheir irreality are \u201cpseudo-statements if they claim to be\ntheoretical statements\u201d (ibid).\n\nWhere Carnap could make no sense of the notion of mind-independent\nreality, Albert Einstein had no such difficulty. For, together with\nPodolsky and Rosen, Einstein famously proposed a test for elements of\nreality in their EPR paper [Einstein, Podolsky and Rosen 1935:\n777\u20138]:\n\nIf, without in any way disturbing a system, we can predict with\ncertainty (i.e. with probability equal to unity) the value of a\nphysical quantity, then there exists an element of physical reality\ncorresponding to this physical quantity.\n\n\nTim Maudlin [2014, p.7] explains the significance of the EPR criterion\nthus:\n\nSuppose \u2026 I can without in any way disturbing a system\npredict with certainty the value of a physical quantity \u2026 then the\nrelevant element of reality obtained \u2026 independently of the\ndetermination being made. Because, as we have said, the means of\ndetermination did not (by hypothesis) disturb the system.\n\n\nRealists might wish to endorse the EPR criterion as an idealized test\nfor the mind-independent reality of (macro-)physical quantities\n\u2014 even if we rarely (if at all) are able to \u201cpredict with\ncertainty\u201d the outcome of an experiment, we can, some would\nargue, approach near-certainty in a significant class of cases without\ndisturbing the system. Carnapian anti-realists, however, will deny the\nEPR criterion validates any external notion of mind-independent\nexistence, regarding it instead as a means of settling internal\nexistence questions about physical quantities.\n",
