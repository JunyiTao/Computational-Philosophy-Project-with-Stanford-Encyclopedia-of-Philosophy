    "main_text": "\n\nSimon of Faversham (\u2020 1306) was a thirteenth-century scholar,\nmainly known as a commentator on Aristotle\u2019s logic and natural\nphilosophy. He is considered a modist, among other things because of\nhis use of the notions of modi praedicandi and modi\nessendi in his commentary on Aristotle\u2019s\nCategories (cf. Marmo 1999). Simon\u2019s work as an\nAristotelian commentator heavily relies on Albert the Great\u2019s\nparaphrases on the Aristotelian corpus. Simon\u2019s\nquestion-commentaries often portray key medieval discussions in a\nsomewhat undeveloped state. But in some issues, such as the discussion\non empty reference, he exhibits good philosophical analysis and\nresourcefulness. Simon\u2019s works are also of great historical\ninterest because they represent an important stage in the development\nof thirteenth-century philosophical ideas. His corpus is relatively\nunexplored, and although an important part of it is extant, a large\npart is also unedited.\n",
