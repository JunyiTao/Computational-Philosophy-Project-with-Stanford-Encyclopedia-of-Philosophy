The heart-mind and its ontological relation to the body in classical Chinese philosophy\n\nComparative interpreters frequently address whether the heart-mind is\nconceived as being separate or ontologically distinct from the body as\nthey are, for example, in Cartesian dualism. The dominant view in\nscholarship is that Chinese thought is not dualistic in any fashion.\nThe minority view is that it does not fall into ontological\ndualism, and that it is all the better for avoiding it, but other\nforms of dualism may fairly be attributed to Chinese thought.\n",
