    "main_text": "Historical Outline || Farabian Aristotelianism\n1.2 Farabian Aristotelianism\n\nSoon after, however, Baghdad philosophy was dominated by self-styled\nPeripatetics who presented themselves as reestablishing Aristotle's\ntrue teachings after a period of rupture. The leading lights of this\nmovement were the Syriac Christian Ab\u00fb Bishr Matt\u00e2 ibn\nY\u00fbnus (d.\u00a0940) and his younger Muslim colleague, Ab\u00fb\nNasr Alfarabi (d.\u00a0950). In the early 900s, Ab\u00fb Bishr added\ntranslations from the Syriac of the Poetics and the Posterior\nAnalytics to the growing Arabic Organon. He and his\ncolleagues also contributed to a commentary tradition on each component\nof the Organon.\n\nAb\u00fb Bishr lumbers into every piece that has been written on the\nhistory of Arabic logic as the clumsy advocate of the view that\nspeakers of Arabic need to learn Greek logic. In a disputation on the\nrelative merits of grammar and logic convened for the amusement of the\nVizier, he confronts a dashing young opponent,\nS\u00eer\u00e2f\u00ee, who confounds him with a series of\ngrammatical subtleties. To these, Ab\u00fb Bishr responds:\nThis is grammar, and I have not studied grammar. The\nlogician has no need of grammar, whereas the grammarian does need\nlogic. For logic enquires into the meaning, whereas grammar enquires\ninto the expression. If, therefore, the logician deals with the\nexpression, it is accidental, and it is likewise accidental if the\ngrammarian deals with the meaning. Now, the meaning is more exalted\nthan the expression, and the expression humbler than the\n meaning.[5]\n\nWhatever the merits of Ab\u00fb Bishr's view of the relation of logic\nto language, it weathered S\u00eer\u00e2f\u00ee's storm of\ncriticism badly. Assessments differ as to what we should learn from\nthis discussion,[6]\nbut it serves at least to show that some were sceptical of the utility\nof Aristotelian logic. Other Muslim scholars went further than\nS\u00eer\u00e2f\u00ee and considered the study of logic impious,\nmainly because of its association with metaphysics. As one fideist\nscholar put it many years later, \u201cthe access to something bad is\nalso bad\u201d (Ibn as-Sal\u00e2h (d.\u00a01245), quoted in Goldziher\n1981: 205\u2013206). \n\nIt was Ab\u00fb Bishr's younger colleague, Alfarabi, who was the\noutstanding contributor to the Aristotelian project, though not as a\ntranslator (see now Rudolph 2012). On the question of the relation of\nlogic to language, Alfarabi offers a view somewhat more nuanced than\nAb\u00fb Bishr's (see 2.1.1 below). He also\nclaimed that logic was indispensable for analysing the argument-forms\nused in jurisprudence and theology, a claim that was to be taken up a\ncentury later by Ab\u00fb Hamid al-Ghaz\u00e2l\u00ee\n(d.\u00a01111), thereby preparing the way to introduce logic into the\nmadrasa (see 1.4.1 below). To support his claim,\nAlfarabi wrote The Short Treatise on Reasoning in the Way of the\nTheologians.\n\u2026in which he interpreted the arguments of the\ntheologians and the analogies (qiy\u00e2s\u00e2t) of the\njurists as logical\nsyllogisms in accordance with the doctrines of the\n ancients.[7]\n\nBut Alfarabi's main contribution to the Aristotelian project was a\nseries of commentaries on the books of the Organon\u2014many\nof them\nsadly lost\u2014which represent the finest achievement in the study of\nAristotelian logic in Arabic. His work in this area aims at the Lesser\nHarmony, the \u201cproject of forging a single, consistent doctrine\nout of the sometimes incongruent theories found in Aristotle's many\ntreatises;\u201d and this marks him out as clinging\nto a major hermeneutical commitment of late antiquity (see Wisnovsky\n2003: 15, 266). The quality of Alfarabi's arguments is clear from his\nremaining long commentaries on\n Aristotle.[8]\n He is the first truly independent thinker\nin Arabic logic, a fact commemorated by the honorific bestowed upon him\nby Avicenna: the Second Teacher (after Aristotle). When Avicenna laid\nout his own syllogistic, he noted each point on which he differed from\nAlfarabi (Street 2001).\n\nThe tradition with which Alfarabi was associated, a tradition centred\non exegetical problems in the Organon, reached its crowning\nachievement\u2014a superb and heavily glossed translation of\nthe\n Organon[9]\u2014at\n the same time that Avicenna was\nsetting about his work in the East, work which was to make\nthe Organon irrelevant for the vast majority of subsequent\nArabic logicians.\n\nThis is a watershed moment: the Farabian tradition continued its work\non the Aristotelian texts, though ever more defensively and reactively\nto challenges posed by Avicenna. The Avicennan tradition by contrast\nsimply ignored the Aristotelian texts. The Farabian tradition shrank\naway so quickly that even by the late twelfth century, to study\nFarabian logic meant traveling to North\n Africa.[10] Spain and North\nAfrica were its last strongholds, and the work of Averroes \n(see 1.4.2 below) is best understood as a\ncommentary on Aristotle determined in its focus and direction by the\ncriticisms of Avicenna.\n",
