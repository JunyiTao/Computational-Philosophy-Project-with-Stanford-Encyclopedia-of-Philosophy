    "main_text": "Dreaming and theories of consciousness || Dreaming as a model system and test case for consciousness research\n3.1 Dreaming as a model system and test case for consciousness research\n\nDreams are a global state of consciousness in which experience arises\nunder altered behavioral and neurophysiological conditions as compared\nto standard wakefulness; unlike other altered states of consciousness\n(such as drug-induced or deep meditative states) and pathological wake\nstates (such as psychosis or neurological syndromes), dreams occur\nspontaneously and regularly in healthy subjects. For both reasons,\nmany regard dreams as a test case for theories of consciousness or\neven an ideal model system for consciousness research (Churchland 1988;\nRevonsuo 2006).\n\nExisting proposals differ on the phenomenology of dreaming: referring\nto dream bizarreness, Churchland describes dream experience as\nrobustly different from waking, whereas Revonsuo argues dreaming is\nsimilar to waking and the purest form of experience:\n\n\nthe dreaming brain brings out the phenomenal level of organization in\na clear and distinct form. Dreaming is phenomenality pure and simple,\nuntouched by external physical stimulation or behavioural activity.\n(Revonsuo 2006: 75) \n\n\nRevonsuo argues dreaming reveals the basic, state-independent\nstructure of consciousness to be immersive: \u201cdreaming depicts\nconsciousness first and foremost as a subjective\nworld-for-me\u201d (Revonsuo 2006: 75). This leads him to\nintroduce the \u201cworld-simulation metaphor of\nconsciousness\u201d, according to which consciousness itself is\nessentially simulational and dreamlike. This is taken to support\ninternalism about conscious experience.\n\nThis latter claim is also contentious. No\u00eb (2004: 213) argues\nthat phenomenological differences between dreaming and waking (such as\ngreater instability of visual dream imagery) result from the lack of\ndynamic interaction with the environment in dreams. He proposes this\nshows that neural states are sufficient for dreaming but denies they\nare also sufficient for perceptual experience.\n\nA possible problem for both views is their reliance on background\nassumptions about the phenomenology of dreaming and its disconnection\nfrom environmental stimuli and bodily sensations. Windt (2015a, 2018)\nargues both internalism and externalism mistakenly assume dreams to be\nisolated from external sensory input and own-body perception; she\nbelieves both the phenomenology of dreaming and its correlation with\nexternal stimuli are complex and variable. She argues the analysis of\ndreaming does not clearly support either side in the debate on\ninternalism vs externalism (but see Rosen 2018a). Generally, in the\nabsence of a well worked out theory of dreaming and its sleep-stage\nand neural correlates, proposals for using dreaming as a model system\nor test case run the risk of relying on an oversimplified description\nof the target phenomenon (Windt & Noreika 2011).\n\nRecent accounts appealing to generative models and predictive\nprocessing (Clark 2013b; Hohwy 2013) suggest a new, unified account of\nperception, imagination, and dreaming. In these accounts, different\nmental states, including perception and action, embody different\nstrategies of hypothesis testing and prediction error minimization.\nPerception is the attempt to model the hidden external causes of\nsensory stimuli; action involves keeping the internal model stable\nwhile changing the sensory input. Clark argues that on such a\nmodel,\n\n\nsystems that know how to perceive an object as a cat are thus systems\nthat, ipso facto, are able to use a top-down cascade to bring\nabout the kinds of activity pattern that would be characteristic of\nthe presence of a cat. [\u2026] Perceivers like us, if this is\ncorrect, are inevitably potential dreamers and imaginers too.\nMoreover, they are beings who, in dreaming and imagining, are\ndeploying many of the very same strategies and resources used in\nordinary perception. (Clark 2013a: 764) \n\n\nPredictive processing accounts have also been used to explain specific\nfeatures of dreaming. Bizarreness has been associated with the\ncomparative lack of external stimulus processing, implying dream\nimagery is relatively unconstrained by prediction errors (cf. Hobson\n& Friston 2012; Fletcher & Frith 2008; Bucci & Grasso\n2017). Windt (2018) suggests a predictive processing account of dream\nimagery generation that links bodily self-experience to own-body\nperception and subtle motor behaviors such as twitching in REM sleep\n(Blumberg 2010; Blumberg & Plumeau 2016). She argues that movement\nsensations in dreams, in relation to REM-sleep related muscle\ntwitching, involve a form of bodily self-sampling in which coordinated\nmuscular activity contributes to the generation and maintenance of a\nbody model. This is important because in predictive processing\naccounts neither the bodily nor the external causes of sensory inputs\nare known; at the same time, having an accurate body model is a\nprerequisite for action, requiring the system to disambiguate between\nself- and other generated changes to sensory inputs. Especially in\nearly development, sleep might provide the ideal conditions for\nexploring one\u2019s own body via subtle but coordinated muscular activity\nwhile processing of visual and auditory stimuli is reduced.\n\nDreams have also been suggested as a test case for whether phenomenal\nconsciousness can be divorced from cognitive access (e.g., Block 2007;\nbut see Cohen & Dennett 2011). Sebasti\u00e1n (2014a) argues\nthat dreams provide empirical evidence that conscious experience can\noccur independently of cognitive access. This is because during\n(non-lucid) REM-sleep dreams, the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex\n(dlPFC) as the most plausible mechanism underlying cognitive access is\nselectively deactivated (see also Pantani et al. 2018). This would\nchallenge theories linking conscious experience to access, such as\nhigher-order-thought theory (Sebasti\u00e1n 2014b). However, both\nthe hypoactivation of the dlPCF in REM sleep and its association with\ncognitive access have been debated. Fazekas and Nemeth (2018) suggest\nthat certain kinds of cognitive access may be independent of dlPFC\nactivation, necessitating a more complex account.\n",
