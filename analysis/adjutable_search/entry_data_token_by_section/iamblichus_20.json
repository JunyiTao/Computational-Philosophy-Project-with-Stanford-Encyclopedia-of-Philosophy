    "main_text": "The Soul, Theurgy and Religion || Soul\u2019s ascent and salvation; religion\n6.3 Soul\u2019s ascent and salvation; religion\n\nBelittled as it is in the grand scheme of things, and unable to\nachieve any perpetual union with the intelligible world, the human\nsoul is deemed connatural to \u201cnothingness\u201d (Reply to\nPorphyry III, 18 [SS-2013: 108.16\u201317]). It now needs\nexternal help from the gods\u2014that is, grace\u2014in\norder to perform any relevant action. Broken in its essence,\nit is, however, able to regain some ground through its\nactivity. Co-action with the gods, \u201cgodlike\naction\u201d (theourgia, i.e., theurgy), is the purpose of\nthe Iamblichean soul, which it attains through religious acts such as\nprayer, offerings, sacrifice, etc., that is the very liturgy that\nPorphyry had attacked in the Letter to Anebo. Hence the\nnecessary connection between two fields, psychology and the philosophy\nof religion, which was clearly set out by Shaw (1995). Ritual is given\nprecedence over philosophical ascesis or discursive thinking, although\nIamblichus would say that he is merely giving philosophy its due place\nrather than abolishing it: it is also true that he underlines the need\nfor the religious practitioner to be virtuous, individual sanctity\nbeing a requisite to make the medium apt to receive the gods\u2019\ninflux. But Iamblichus heavily stresses that the key to the whole\nprocess always lies in the gods: very interestingly,\n\u201chuman\u201d, \u201cartificial\u201d or \u201cnatural\u201d\ncontributions are equally side-lined and relegated to the status of\nmere auxiliary causes (see, e.g., Reply to Porphyry III, 9\n[SS-2013: 89.7\u20139]). He is also adamant about the human inability\nto extort any effect from the higher beings (i.e., via\n\u201cmagic\u201d), since they are by nature impassible.\n\nIt remains beyond doubt that his stance on the matter is\nanti-intellectualist in nature and thus in stark contrast with the\nteachings of Plotinus and Porphyry. One does not start with\nself-knowledge, as Porphyry had set out to demonstrate in a treatise\nOn the phrase: \u201cKnow thyself\u201d, which he had\ndedicated to Iamblichus, no doubt cognizant of all the implications of\nthis (Fr. 273 Smith = Stobaeus, Anthology III, 21, 26).\nInstead, knowledge of the gods encompasses self-knowledge (Reply\nto Porphyry X, 1 [SS-2013: 212.2\u20133]) and should be taken as\nthe correct starting-point. What remains intellectualistic in\nIamblichus\u2019 approach is the conviction that not acting in the\nlight of theological knowledge leads to the failure of the ritual\nprocess (ibid. II, 10 [SS-2013: 68.25\u201369.20]).\nAccordingly, the best theurgist is also the best theologian: and since\nIamblichus\u2019 theology is highly philosophical in nature, insofar\nas it strives to identify the Pagan gods with metaphysical forces or\nconcepts and submits them to the authority of the Platonic One, it\nseems necessary that, in Iamblichus\u2019 system, precedence be given\nto Neoplatonist religious specialists deriving their information from\nthe appropriate literature. In this respect, theurgy represents a\nrationalization of the irrational, rather than the converse. It is\nalso important to note that the conflict between the\nPlotino-Porphyrian approach and Iamblichus\u2019 one does not simply\namount to a conflict between philosophy and religion; rather, it\nopposes two different modes of access to the divine, with\nIamblichus\u2019 predecessors laying emphasis on silent ascesis and\nthe shedding of our external identity, and accordingly viewing\ncorporeality and materiality as something inherently negative.\n\nAccording to Iamblichus, the gods help mankind overcome its inherent\nweakness by revealing symbols to them that will establish some sort of\nconnection: one of the criticisms he lays on Porphyry is that his\nviews will \u201cleave earth deprived of the presence of the superior\nbeings\u201d (Reply to Porphyry I, 8 [SS-2013:\n21.12\u201313]; on related issues concerning Porphyry\u2019s\nand Iamblichus\u2019 contrasting views on dreams and divination, see\nTimotin [2022] 109\u2013126). These symbols may differ in nature:\nitems, rituals, myths, theological revelations such as the\nChaldean Oracles, etc.; and most of them are placed under the\npatronage of a particular deity, thus creating a \u201cchain\u201d\n(seira) of, say, sun-like entities. In this manner,\nIamblichean ontology necessarily leads to cultural traditionalism; it\nalso opens up the possibility of a grandiose sumph\u014dnia\nof all Pagan schools or currents, be they Hellenic or\n\u201cbarbarian\u201d, the latter actually being assigned even more\nprestige insofar as the Egyptians, Assyrians, Phoenicians etc. enjoy\ngreater antiquity and\u2014supposedly\u2014avoided innovation,\ncontrary to the Greeks (Reply to Porphyry VII, 5 [SS-2013:\n192.22\u201324]). A whole new field thus opened up for Platonists in\nwhich they could exercise their exegetical virtuosity in search of\nremarkable analogies. It is no wonder, then, that Iamblichus\u2019\nviews were heartily embraced by later proponents of a \u201cPagan\nrevival\u201d, of whom the most prominent was Julian the Apostate: a\nRoman emperor as well as the pupil of Maximus of Ephesus, who was a\nphilosopher in the tradition of Iamblichus in addition to being the\nmost infamous theurgist of his time.\n",
