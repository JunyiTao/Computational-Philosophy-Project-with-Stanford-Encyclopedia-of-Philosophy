    "main_text": "The Interim Account: 1903\n3. The Interim Account: 1903\n\nIn 1903, Peirce gave a series of lectures at Harvard, and at The\nLowell Institute. Part of these lectures was an account of signs.\nHowever, the 1903 account of signs showed considerable developments to\nthe early account of the 1860s. First, where the early account\nsuggested three classes of sign, the 1903 account suggests ten classes\nof sign. Second, where the account the 1860s treats the general sign,\nor symbol, as the main focus of sign theory, the 1903 account counts\nmany more sign types as within the focus of philosophy and logic.\nThird, Peirce dropped the claim that an infinite chain of signs\nprecedes any given sign (see Short 2004, 221\u20132).\n\nThese changes seem to be partly a consequence of developments in\nsymbolic logic made by Peirce and his Johns Hopkins student, Oscar\nMitchell, in the early 1880s. As is well known, during this time, and\nindependently of Frege, Peirce and Mitchell developed quantification\ntheory (see Peirce 1883, and W5. 162\u2013191). An essential part\nof this development was the inclusion of singular propositions and\nindividual variables for objects that cannot be picked out be definite\ndescriptions. Peirce treated these non-general signs as indices, which\nin turn led him to identify the index as an essential part of logic.\nThis made his earlier account of signs seem underdeveloped. (See, for\ninstance, Short 2004, 219\u2013222; Hookway 2000, 127\u2013131;\nand Murphey 1961, 299\u2013300). This appears to have led Peirce to\ntake signs other than the symbol more seriously. In particular, it led\nPeirce to realize that some symbolic signs had distinctly indexical\n(that is non-general) features. Similarly, symbols with heavily iconic\nfeatures, especially in mathematics (see Hookway 1985 Ch 6), were more\nimportant than he thought. What this meant, of course, was that the\naccount of the 1860s was now woefully inadequate to the task of\ncapturing the range of signs and signification that Peirce thought\nimportant for philosophy and logic.\n\nA further point worth noting about Peirce\u2019s developing\nsign theory is that by 1903, he had begun to think of his overall\nphilosophy in architectonic terms, and this included a broadening of\nhis view of semiotics (see Atkin 2015, 15\u201320). Put simply, Peirce\nthought that all domains of thought were connected and structured\nhierarchically, and that logic, \u201cin its general sense, is\n\u2026 only another name for semiotic\u201d (CP2.227 1897).\nLogic, construed as extensive with semiotic, in Peirce\u2019s\nhierarchy contained three domains \u2013 Speculative\nGrammar (which is the study of sign classifications);\nCritical Logic (which is the study of the form and evaluation\nof arguments); and Methodeutic (which is the student of\nscientific inquiry). The discussion of Peirce\u2019s sign theory here\nis placed firmly in the domain of speculative grammar, however, in the\nlater developments of his work, Peirce began to think of these\nthree areas of \u201clogic\u201d as involving semiotics. (See\nBellucci 2017 for a discussion of speculative grammar and its\ndevelopment in Peirce\u2019s thought).\n\nPeirce\u2019s 1903 account of signs, then, is notable for its broader\nscope, relative neatness, and completeness. In it Peirce returns to\nthe basic sign structure we gave above and by paying close attention\nto those elements of signs and the various interactions between them\ngives what seems to be an extensive account of signification, and an\nexhaustive typology of signs far beyond the range of his early account\nof the 1860s. To understand Peirce\u2019s 1903 account, we must return to\nthe three elements of signification, namely, the sign-vehicle, the\nobject, and the interpretant and see how Peirce thinks their function\nin signification leads to an exhaustive classification of sign\ntypes.\n",
