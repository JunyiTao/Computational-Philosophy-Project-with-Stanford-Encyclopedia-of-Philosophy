    "main_text": "Historiographical Debates\n2. Historiographical Debates\n\nBroader currents in society have influenced the ways in which scholars\nand activists have approached research into sexuality and same-sex\nattraction. Some early 20th century researchers and\nequality advocates, seeking to vindicate same-sex relations in\nsocieties that disparaged and criminalized it, put forward lists of\nfamous historical figures attracted to persons of the same sex. Such\nlists implied a common historical entity underlying sexual attraction,\nwhether one called it \u2018inversion\u2019 or\n\u2018homosexuality.\u2019 This approach (or perhaps closely related\nfamily of approaches) is commonly called essentialism. Historians and\nresearchers sympathetic to the gay liberation movement of the late\n1960s and 1970s produced a number of books that implicitly relied on\nan essentialist approach. In the 1970s and 1980s John Boswell raised\nit to a new level of methodological and historical sophistication,\nalthough his position shifted over time to one of virtual agnosticism\nbetween essentialists and their critics. Crompton\u2019s work (2003)\nis a notable contemporary example of an essentialist methodology.\n\nEssentialists claim that categories of sexual attraction are observed\nrather than created. For example, while ancient Greece did not have\nterms that correspond to the heterosexual/homosexual division, persons\ndid note men who were only attracted to person of a specific sex,\nhence the lack of terminology need not be taken as evidence of a lack\nof continuity in categories. Through history and across cultures there\nare consistent features, albeit with meaningful variety over time and\nspace, in sexual attraction to the point that it makes sense of speak\nof specific sexual orientations. According to this view, homosexuality\nis a specific, natural kind rather than a cultural or historical\nproduct. Essentialists allow that there are cultural differences in\nhow homosexuality is expressed and interpreted, but they emphasize\nthat this does not prevent it from being a universal category of human\nsexual expression.\n\nIn contrast, in the 1970s and since a number of researchers, often\ninfluenced by Mary McIntosh or Michel Foucault, argued that class\nrelations, the human sciences, and other historically constructed\nforces create sexual categories and the personal identities associated\nwith them. For advocates of this view, such as David Halperin, how sex\nis organized in a given cultural and historical setting is irreducibly\nparticular (Halperin, 2002). The emphasis on the social creation of\nsexual experience and expression led to the labeling of the viewpoint\nas social constructionism, although more recently several of its\nproponents have preferred the term \u2018historicism.\u2019 Thus\nhomosexuality, as a specific sexual construction, is best understood\nas a solely modern, Western concept and role. Prior to the development\nof this construction, persons were not really \u2018homosexual\u2019\neven when they were only attracted to persons of the same sex. The\ndifferences between, say, ancient Greece, with its emphasis on\npederasty, role in the sex act, and social status, and the\ncontemporary Western role of \u2018gay\u2019 or\n\u2018homosexual\u2019 are simply too great to collapse into one\ncategory.\n\nIn a manner closely related to the claims of queer theory, discussed\nbelow, social constructionists argue that specific social constructs\nproduce sexual ways of being. There is no given mode of sexuality that\nis independent of culture; even the concept and experience of sexual\norientation itself are products of history. For advocates of this\nview, the range of historical sexual diversity, and the fluidity of\nhuman possibility, is simply too varied to be adequately captured by\nany specific conceptual scheme.\n\nThere is a significant political dimension to this seemingly abstract\nhistoriographical debate. Social constructionists argue that\nessentialism is the weaker position politically for at least two\nreasons. First, by accepting a basic heterosexual/homosexual\norganizing dichotomy, essentialism wrongly concedes that\nheterosexuality is the norm and that homosexuality is, strictly\nspeaking, abnormal and the basis for a permanent minority. Second,\nsocial constructionists argue that an important goal of historical\ninvestigations should be to put into question contemporary organizing\nschemas about sexuality. The acceptance of the contemporary\nheterosexual/homosexual dichotomy is conservative, perhaps even\nreactionary, and forecloses the exploration of new possibilities.\n(There are related queer theory criticisms of the essentialist\nposition, discussed below.) In contrast, essentialists argue that a\nhistoricist approach forecloses the very possibility of a \u2018gay\nhistory.\u2019 Instead, the field of investigation becomes other\nsocial forces and how they \u2018produce\u2019 a distinct form or\nforms of sexuality. Only an essentialist approach can maintain the\nproject of gay history, and minority histories in general, as a force\nfor liberation.\n",
