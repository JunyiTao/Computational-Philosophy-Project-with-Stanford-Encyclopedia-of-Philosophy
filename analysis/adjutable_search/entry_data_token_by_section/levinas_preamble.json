    "main_text": "\n\nEmmanuel Levinas\u2019 (1905\u20131995) intellectual project was to\ndevelop a first philosophy. Whereas traditionally first philosophy\ndenoted either metaphysics or theology, only to be reconceived by\nHeidegger as fundamental ontology, Levinas argued that it is ethics\nthat should be so conceived. But rather than formulating an ethical\ntheory, Levinas developed his philosophy in opposition to\nboth these aforementioned approaches. It takes the form of a\ndescription and interpretation of the event of encountering another\n person.[1]\n Giving rise to spontaneous acts of responsibility for others, the\nencounter unfolds, according to Levinas, at a precognitive level,\nthanks to what he called our embodied\n \u201csensibility\u201d.[2]\n That is why a phenomenology of intersubjective responsibility would\nbe \u2018first\u2019 philosophy; viz., in the sense of\ninterpretively reconstructing a level of experience precursive to both\nreflective activity and practical interests. \n\nSome commentators have called Levinas\u2019 work an ethics of ethics,\nothers a meta-ethics, while still others have urged that his thought\ncan accommodate many ethical theories, from intuitionism to\nrationalism (see below). However that may be, his work is in\nongoing, critical dialogue with three philosophers: Husserl,\nHeidegger, and Hegel. Given these targets\u2014as well as\nphilosophical interlocutors like Maurice\nMerleau-Ponty\u2014Levinas\u2019 philosophy begins from an enlarged\nconception of lived embodiment and a powerful extension of\nHusserl\u2019s technique of suspending conceptualization to reveal\nexperience as it comes to light. He is also indebted to Heidegger for\nhis hermeneutics of being-in-the-world. \n",
