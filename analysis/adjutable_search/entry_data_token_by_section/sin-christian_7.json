    "main_text": "Sin as State || Original Sin\n4.2 Original Sin\n\nThe Christian doctrine of original sin can also be understood as a\nkind of state or \u201ccondition\u201d (see Mann 2001: 47). While,\nas discussed in\n section 2.1,\n primal sin refers to the temporally first sin, original sin is\noriginal in the sense that \u201cit is an evil at the origins of\nhuman agency, and from which human agency flows\u201d (Couenhoven\n2016: 193). Original sin is sometimes referred to as human beings\npossessing a \u201csinful nature\u201d. This view leads to certain\nChristological worries, however: if the Second Person of the Trinity\nbecomes incarnate and assumes a human nature, then if human nature is\nsomehow itself sinful, Christ would also be sinful. But all Christian\ntheories hold that the Incarnate Christ is fully human as well as\nfully divine, and yet without original sin. (For discussions of the\nrelationship between Christ\u2019s divine nature and the human nature\nassumed in the Incarnation, see Pawl 2019 and 2016). Some Christian\ntraditions also hold that Mary the mother of Jesus also was free from\nsin via the immaculate conception. Because such language about human\nnature itself becoming sinful can be misleading (see Copan 2003: 523)\nand also potentially in conflict with the conviction that all things\ncreated by God are good, original sin is perhaps better described in\nterms of human nature\u2019s being distorted. In virtue of its\ndistorting effects, original sin thus \u201cbecomes the origin of\nactual sins\u201d (Blocher 1997: 19), and perhaps even a condition\nthat almost inevitably leads to sinful actions (see Franks 2012:\n3).\n\nWhile the doctrine of original sin isn\u2019t explicitly taught in\nthe Christian scriptures, it \u201cwas developed from scriptural\nwarrants\u201d (Green 2017: 115). It also is a distinctively\nChristian doctrine (Quinn 1997: 541), rejected by both Judaism and\nIslam. Augustine played a central role in the historical development\nof the doctrine of original sin. In contrast to Pelagius and\nCaelestius who denied that humans inherit original sin via the fall\n(see Timpe 2014a: chapter 4 and Couenhoven 2013), Augustine maintained\nthat through Adam\u2019s sin, the whole human race is now\n\n\nbound by the chain of death and justly condemned, \u2026lead by a\nsuccession of miseries from its depraved origin, as from a corrupt\nroot. (Augustine City of God, XIII.14)\n\n\nAugustine\u2019s view in this debate was codified by the Councils of\nCarthage (418) and Orange (529), with Pelagius\u2019 view being\ndeclared heresy in the West, and thus the components of this view\ndeserves a closer look. (For a discussion of the history of the\ndoctrine, see Vanneste 1971.)\n\nIn what follows, I will follow Jesse Couenhoven, who argues that\nAugustine\u2019s doctrine of original sin has five parts and\ndistinguishes between them as follows:\n\nthe primal sin;\nthe participation of the rest of the human race (except Jesus and,\nin some traditions, Mary) in that sin because of their solidarity with\nthose who committed the first human sin;\ninvoluntary and inherited common guilt that all humans (again\nexcept Jesus and, in some traditions, Mary) are subject to because of\nthat solidarity;\npenalty to human nature because of the primal sin; and\nthe transmission of inherited sin and its penalty. (Couenhoven\n2013: 46; for slightly different categorizations, see Blocher 1997 and\nCrisp 2019: chapter 7)\n\n\nOf these, (1) has already been dealt with above in\n section 2.1.\n (2) is a claim about the scope of those who are affected by original\nsin, and in what follows I will assume the restriction that excludes\nJesus and, in Catholicism and parts of the Orthodox tradition, his\nmother Mary. I address claims (3) and (4) respectively in\n section 4.3\n and\n section 4.4.\n Other than noting that there are a range of options regarding how\noriginal sin (which is sometimes referred to as hereditary sin, or\nerbs\u00fcnde in Germanic languages) is transmitted, ranging\nfrom Augustine\u2019s view that this transmission occurs via semen as\npart of sexual intercourse to its occurring through participation in\nsinful human community (see Couenhoven 2013: chapter 7), I will not\nfocus on claim (5) either in what follows.\n",
