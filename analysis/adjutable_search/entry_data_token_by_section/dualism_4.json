One is\nthat of substance, the other is the dualism of these\nsubstances. A substance is characterized by its properties, but,\naccording to those who believe in substances, it is more than the\ncollection of the properties it possesses, it is the thing\nwhich possesses them. So the mind is not just a collection of\nthoughts, but is that which thinks, an immaterial substance\nover and above its immaterial states. Properties are the properties of\nobjects. If one is a property dualist, one may wonder what\nkinds of objects possess the irreducible or immaterial properties in\nwhich one believes. One can use a neutral expression and attribute them\nto persons, but, until one has an account of person,\nthis is not explanatory. One might attribute them to human beings\nqua animals, or to the brains of these animals. Then one will\nbe holding that these immaterial properties are possessed by what is\notherwise a purely material thing. But one may also think that not only\nmental states are immaterial, but that the subject that possesses them\nmust also be immaterial. Then one will be a dualist about that to\nwhich mental states and properties belong as well about the\nproperties themselves. Now one might try to think of these subjects as\njust bundles of the immaterial states. This is Hume\u2019s view. But if one\nthinks that the owner of these states is something quite over and above\nthe states themselves, and is immaterial, as they are, one will be a\nsubstance dualist.\n\n\nSubstance dualism is also often dubbed \u2018Cartesian\ndualism\u2019, but some substance dualists are keen to distinguish\ntheir theories from Descartes\u2019s. E. J. Lowe, for example, is a\nsubstance dualist, in the following sense. He holds that a normal\nhuman being involves two substances, one a body and the other a\nperson. The latter is not, however, a purely mental substance that can\nbe defined in terms of thought or consciousness alone, as Descartes\nclaimed. But persons and their bodies have different identity\nconditions and are both substances, so there are two substances\nessentially involved in a human being, hence this is a form of\nsubstance dualism. Lowe (2006) claims that his theory is close to\nP. F. Strawson\u2019s (1959), whilst admitting that Strawson would not have\ncalled it substance dualism.\n",
