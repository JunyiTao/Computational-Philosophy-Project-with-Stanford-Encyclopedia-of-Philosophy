Armstrong (1997) argues that irreducible\ndeterminables are needed to make sense of functionally specified laws\nin physics. Consider Newton\u2019s law of gravitation:\n\n\\[F = K (M_1 M_2)/D\\]\n\n\nAs Armstrong notes (see also Fales 1990: 61, Mellor 1998: 190, 208,\nand French 2014), substitution of the determinable quantities \\(F\\),\n\\(M\\), and \\(D\\) with determinate values gives rise to \u201ca law\nwhich stands as determinate to the original, determinable, law\u201d\n(1997: 63). One might try to provide an anti-realist or reductionist\ntreatment of these seemingly determinable laws. Armstrong (1997)\nargues, however, that such deflationary treatments cannot make sense\nof the role of functional laws in sustaining counterfactuals, at least\nif properties are Aristotelian universals, whose existence depends\nupon their being instantiated; for then there will typically (and\nperhaps necessarily, for the case of continuous quantities) be gaps in\nthe actual instantiations of functional laws. As such, the unity of\ndeterminates in these cases involves not just partial identities (as\ndiscussed in\n \u00a73.3)\n but \u201cstrictly identical second-order properties\u201d, which\nare the \u201creal [\u2026] determinables\u201d (1997: 247).\nMellor similarly maintains that in Newton\u2019s law, \u201cthe\ndeterminables ... are second order universals\u201d which exist along\nwith associated first-order determinate universals (1998: 209).\nFunctional laws of nature are then taken to be relations between these\ndeterminable universals.\n\nFrench offers a structuralist account of laws of nature as expressing\ndeterminable relations (a position Mellor also considers; 1998: 209).\nAs regards Newton\u2019s law, French says:\n\n\nIf we insert specific values [\u2026], we obtain a determinate\ninstance of the law, expressing the relation that holds between\ndeterminate properties. So, the law as a whole can be regarded as\nexpressing a determinable relation, which can be made determinate in\nspecific situations. (2014: 300)\n\n\nAgain, French allows that determinable laws/relations may be\nfundamental. Reflecting that one reason for taking (some)\ndeterminables to be fundamental is that these are partly constituted\nby modal facts pertaining to their possible determinations (see Wilson\n2012), French moreover suggests that the determinable nature of laws\nprovides a basis for physical modality:\n\n\nthese determinate instances correspond to solutions that can be\nrepresented by (more) specific models of the theory, and it is the\nshared structure between these models that yields the relevant\nphysical modality. The relationship between the more generic and more\nspecific models can be captured by that between determinables and\ndeterminates. (2014: 300)\n\n\nAnother application of determination to the metaphysics of laws\nconcerns whether these are contingent, in having at best a restricted\nphysical or nomological modality, or rather are metaphysically\nnecessary. Kistler (2005) argues that such laws are metaphysically\nnecessary, first arguing that the quantities in \u2018laws of\nassociation\u2019 such as the ideal gas law are reasonably seen as\ndifferent determinables of the same determinate states, such that such\nlaws are necessary; then generalizing on the base of systematicity\nconsiderations to other kinds of\n laws.[43]\n",
