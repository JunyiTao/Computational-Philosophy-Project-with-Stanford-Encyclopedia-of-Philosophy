Historical Background\n\n\nIn the twelfth and thirteenth centuries, southern France (the Midi,\nOccitania, what the Jews called \u201cProvence\u201d) was the most\nactive center of Jewish philosophy. There, in the communities of\nB\u00e9ziers, Carcassonne, Narbonne, Lunel, Montpellier, Arles, and\nMarseilles, Jewish scholars devoted themselves to the translation and\ndissemination of philosophical texts and ideas. During the period\n1148\u20131306 in particular\u2014from the Almohad persecutions in Islamic\nSpain to the expulsion of the Jews from France\u2014much of the\nclassical tradition, as translated into Arabic and developed in the\nIslamic world, was made available in Hebrew. This included works of\nphilosophy and theology, logic and grammar, mathematics, astronomy,\nastrology, and medicine.\n\n\nThe main translators during this period were members of a single\nfamily. Judah Ibn Tibbon (c. 1120\u20131190), a native of Granada,\nresettled in Lunel, where he devoted himself to the translation of\nJudaeo-Arabic works, including texts by Saadia Gaon, Jonah Ibn Janah,\nSolomon Ibn Gabirol, Bahya Ibn Paquda, and Judah Halevi. His son\nSamuel (c. 1165\u20131232) translated Maimonides, and produced the first\nHebrew versions of Aristotle (the Meteorology) and Averroes\n(\u201cThree Treatises on Conjunction,\u201d two by Averroes and one\nby Averroes\u2019 son \u2018Abd Allah). Most prolific was the next\ngeneration of translators. Thus Jacob Anatoli (c. 1194\u20131256), the\nson-in-law and chief disciple of Samuel, translated Ptolemy,\nAverroes\u2019 abridgement of Ptolemy, al-Farghani, and\nAverroes\u2019 middle commentaries on Aristotle\u2019s Organon;\nwhile Samuel\u2019s son Moses (fl. 1244\u20131283) translated dozens of\nworks by Euclid, Geminus, Theodosius, Themistius, Hunayn b. Ishaq, Abu\nBakr al-Razi, Ibn al-Haytham, al-Hassar, Ibn al-Jazzar, al-Farabi,\nAvicenna, Ibn al-Sid al-Batalyawsi, Averroes, Jabir Ibn Aflah,\nal-Bitruji, and Maimonides. The last major figure of the family was\nJacob b. Makhir (c.  1236\u20131306), who translated additional works from\nArabic, by Euclid, Menelaus, Autolycus, Theodosius, Qusta b. Luqa, Ibn\nal-Haytham, Ibn al-Saffar, Azarquel, Jabir ibn Aflah, and Averroes. He\nalso seems to have rendered a work from the Latin: a medical text by\nhis contemporary Arnold of Villanova.\n\n\nThe Ibn Tibbon dynasty of translators was instrumental in creating a\nphilosophical library in Hebrew. They also developed a technical\nterminology, which was used by translators, philosophers, and\ncommentators throughout the Middle Ages. Perhaps more significant,\nhowever, were their contributions as original authors. Thus Samuel and\nMoses wrote philosophical commentaries on the Bible and rabbinic\nliterature and philosophical-exegetical monographs, while Jacob\nAnatoli wrote a collection of philosophical sermons. These writings,\ninspired by the work of Maimonides and saturated with the philosophy\nof al-Farabi and Averroes, laid the foundations for a whole\nmovement of Jewish philosophy and exegesis: Maimonideanism. This\nmovement attracted enthusiasts in Provence, as well as in Italy,\nByzantium, and to a lesser extent Spain. It exercised influence and\ncaused controversy throughout the thirteenth and fourteenth centuries\nand even into the fifteenth, when Jewish philosophy gradually turned\nto Christian-Latin rather than Graeco-Arabic and Arabic sources for\ninspiration.\n",
