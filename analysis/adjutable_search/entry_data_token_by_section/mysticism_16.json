Here is a sampling of soft\nconstructivist arguments:\n\n\n\nPCEs are impossible because of the \u201ckind of beings\u201d that we are\n(Katz 1978, 59). It is a fact about being human that we can\nexperience only with the aid of memory, language, expectations, and\nconceptualizations. Thus, we cannot have a\n\u201cpure\u201d awareness empty of all content. (Also see\nSection 4.2). \n\n\nWe should distinguish an \u201cexperience\u201d from an \u201cevent\u201d\n(Proudfoot 1985, chap. 4; Bagger 1999, chap. 4). That\nX has an experience E entails that X\nconceptualizes E during the event. Hence, even if pure\nconsciousness events happen to occur, they do not count as\n\u201cexperiences\u201d until the subject conceptualizes them, and\nat that moment they cease to be \u201cpure\nconsciousness.\u201d \n\n\nA survey of mystical literature shows that mystical experiences always\nhave conceptual content and thus are not empty of\nconceptualizations. \n\n\nSubjects could not know they had undergone a PCE if the\nexperience were truly empty of all conceptual content\n(Bagger 1999, 102\u2013103) since there would be nothing to\nobserve while it is going on, and hence nothing to retain later. Nor\ncould a subject surmise that a PCE had transpired by remembering a\n\u201cbefore\u201d and an \u201cafter\u201d with an unaccounted for middle. This\nwould fail to distinguish a PCE from plain unconsciousness. \n\n\nSuppose a PCE has occurred and that a subject somehow knows that.\nStill, there is a problem of the relationship of a PCE to the\nsubsequent claims to knowledge: if a PCE were empty of all\nexperiential content, the experiencers could not claim to have\nhad acquaintance of anything (Bagger 1999,\n102\u2013103). Nothing could be retained from the experience to\nshape a mystic\u2019s beliefs or values. \n\n\nSo too, if PCEs were empty of everything but a featureless\nconsciousness, they could not have an impact on the life of a\nmystic, and yet the experiences do have an impact.\nThus, the state must have some differentiated content. \n\n",
