    "main_text": "Immanental Themes and Methods || Feminist Standpoint Epistemology\n5.1 Feminist Standpoint Epistemology\n\nEpistemological questions constitute an important part of the agenda\nfor feminist philosophies of religion. What has the status of\nknowledge in various religious traditions? What gets valorized as\nworth knowing? What are the criteria evoked? Who has the authority to\nestablish religious meaning? Is religious meaning something distinct\nfrom or independent of ordinary linguistic meanings of words? Who is\nthe presumed subject of religious belief? How does the social position\nof the subject affect the content of religious belief? What is the\nimpact upon religious life of the subject\u2019s sexed body? What do we\nlearn by examining the relations between power, on the one hand, and\nwhat counts as evidence, foundations, modes of discourse, forms of\napprehension and transmission, on the other? In view of the intimate\nconnection of power/knowledge, how do we handle the inevitable\nocclusion that attends all knowledge production? What particular\nprocesses constitute the normative cultural subject as masculine in\nits philosophical and religious dimensions?\n\nThe work of feminist philosopher of religion Pamela Sue Anderson\noffers a good example of the feminist standpoint theory approach to\nreligion and gender, unadulterated by any loyalty to Christianity. In\nthe first book-length study to be entitled A Feminist Philosophy\nof Religion (1998) Anderson set out to revise and reform\nphilosophy of religion by using feminist standpoint epistemology as\ndeveloped by Sandra Harding in philosophy of science. A feminist\nstandpoint is not the same as a woman\u2019s experiences, situation, or\nperspective but is rather an achievement of an epistemically informed\nperspective resulting from struggle by or on behalf of women and men\nwho have been dominated, exploited, or oppressed. Applied to\nphilosophy of religion, feminist standpoint epistemology involves\nthinking from the perspective of women who have been oppressed by\nspecific monotheistic religious beliefs. Anderson challenges both the\nprivileged model of God as a disembodied person and the related model\nof reason as neutral, objective, and free of bias and desire. Spinning\nnew myths or devising new conceptions of a divine reality are not part\nof this agenda. There is only the double imperative: \u201cto think\nfrom the lives of others\u201d and \u201cto reinvent ourselves as\nother\u201d.\n\nHowever, adequate understanding of the religious beliefs of embodied\npersons, according to Anderson, requires a deeper analysis of the\nmultiple intertwinings between reason and desire than philosophy of\nreligion normally shows.\n\nBut how are feminists to talk about the material content of female\ndesire? At just this point feminist standpoint epistemology yields to\npoststructuralist insights and Anderson finds in the work of Irigaray,\nKristeva, and bell hooks themes that are missing in mainstream\nepistemology and some feminist epistemology. She articulates her\nphilosophy of religion around \u201cyearning\u201d as a cognitive\nact of a creative and just memory. As used by bell hooks (1990),\nyearning is a positive act that motivates struggle in the search for\npersonal and communal justice. It shapes a spirituality. According to\nAnderson, yearning is the vital reality of human life which gives rise\nto religious belief. Therefore, philosophical analysis of and feminist\nconcern with reason combined with desire, as found in expressions of\nyearning for truth whether epistemological, ethical (justice), or\naesthetic (love or beauty), need to supplement standard approaches to\nphilosophy of religion.\n\nOne must be careful, Anderson says, not to conflate yearning with only\na disguised form of the philosophical aspiration to be\ninfinite. Her analysis of the concept of the infinite reveals a\ncorrupt striving to become infinite or \u201call there is\u201d at\nwork in both masculinist and feminist philosophy of religion. In place\nof this Anderson calls for an approach that would allow instantiating\nthe regulative ideals of truth, love, goodness, and justice as\nconditions for any incorrupt craving for infinitude. Humans can yearn\nfor truth or crave infinitude while at the same time acknowledging\nself-consciously held and embodied locations (Anderson 2001). This\nmeans that, as other philosophers have pointed out, there is no\n\u201cGod\u2019s eye view\u201d, no actual infinite (Aquinas\u2019s\n\u201cactus purus\u201d); the notion of infinity pertains only to\nabstract potentiality, whereas concrete actuality is incurably\nfinite.\n\nQuestions of the justifiability of religious belief have previously\nbeen center stage in philosophy of religion. Anderson does not\nconsider this question per se, but instead analyzes the prior\nquestion of the rational construction of belief and the production of\nknowledge. She considers the ways in which an exclusive focus on\njustification of dominant beliefs excluded women\u2019s beliefs and women\u2019s\nrole in reasoning by assuming that only certain privileged beliefs\nshould be assessed for their truth. At the same time she argues\nagainst any swift dismissal of justificatory questions, as well as\nagainst a strict focus on the justification of theistic\nbeliefs. The myths of Mirabai, the legendary Hindu poetess-saint, and\nAntigone, the mythical figure of insurgence in Greek tragedy, are\nuseful in understanding the notion of yearning as a rational passion\nlinked to bodily experiences (1998: chap. 5). Anderson finds the\ndisruptive mimings of these myths helpful for challenging the narrow\nparameters of empirical realist forms of theism.\n",
