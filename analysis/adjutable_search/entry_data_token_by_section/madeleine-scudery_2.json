    "main_text": "Philosophy\n3. Philosophy\n\nInterpreting the philosophy of Mademoiselle de Scud\u00e9ry requires\ncertain cautions. First, a lifelong disciple of Montaigne,\nScud\u00e9ry repeatedly expresses skepticism concerning the\nenterprise of philosophy itself. The disputes of philosophical schools\noften appear to be nothing more than a Babel of discordant\nauthorities. Despite the furor, no definitive solution to\nphilosophical disputes can impose itself. The contemporary dispute\nover Descartes\u2019s theory of vortices illustrates the obscure,\nendless controversies generated by philosophical pride. \n\n\nThis argument will go on forever. The problem is so complicated. Any\nresolution of it is beyond the power of the human mind. The result\nwill always be an unstable mixture of half-truths and unanticipated\ndifficulties. This problem arises because philosophers generally try\nto say something new rather than saying something true. [EM,\n1: 211] \n\n\nDespite her periodic endorsements of skepticism, Scud\u00e9ry\nclearly maintains that some philosophical theses are true. Her\nreligious philosophy insists that God\u2019s existence can be\ndemonstrated through an argument from design; her moral philosophy\nemphatically praises certain moral qualities as virtuous and condemns\nother moral dispositions as vicious. The skeptical cast of\nScud\u00e9ry\u2019s rhetoric, nonetheless, indicates the\ntentativeness with which her philosophical positions are often\naffirmed.\n\nSecond, Scud\u00e9ry\u2019s dialogical form of philosophy can make\nit difficult to discern which philosophical position Scud\u00e9ry\nactually supports. In the typical \u201cconversation,\u201d multiple\nspeakers defend contrasting views on a given theoretical topic. In\nthis open-ended dialogue, each speaker\u2019s position usually\ncontains certain merits and defects; theories are corrected, altered,\nor abandoned as the exchange progresses. Certain dialogues, such as\nOf Lying, end on an inconclusive note; the disputants cannot\nagree as to whether lying is a universally evil act. In most\ndialogues, however, the speakers clearly concur on a certain\nphilosophical issue or one of the positions defended by a particular\ndisputant is clearly more convincing than the positions defended by\nothers. Unlike the philosophical essay, with its mono-authorial voice,\nthe multiple voices of the philosophical dialogue make the\ndetermination of the author\u2019s actual philosophical position a\ncomplicated enterprise. The irony employed in many Scud\u00e9ry\ndialogues renders this determination of philosophical position even\nmore delicate. \n",
