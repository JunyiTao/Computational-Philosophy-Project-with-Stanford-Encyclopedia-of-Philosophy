    "main_text": "The heart-mind and its ontological relation to the body in classical Chinese philosophy || Critical discussion of holistic interpretations\n1.2 Critical discussion of holistic interpretations\n\nAmes\u2019s and Jullien\u2019s interpretations treat Chinese\nphilosophy as starting from the unity to which Western monists like\nHeraclitus, Spinoza, and Whitehead and the pragmatists William James\nand John Dewey aspired. The matter of modern physics, moreover, is\ncontinuous with energy. The puzzles of quantum entanglement suggest\nthe entire universe might be intermeshed in a single holistic process,\nnot a plethora of separable events in mechanistic causal chains.\n\nIn Chinese thought, qi constitutes not merely the somatic,\nbodily dynamics, but also the motivating force of thoughts, emotions,\nand intentions of the individual. Originally identified with the blood\nand breath of living animals, Zou Yan\u2019s theory of qi as\nthe stuff of everything became China\u2019s common view. The\nMengzi (latinized form \u201cMencius\u201d, 4th\ncentury BCE) postulates a coherence of qi in the world with\nthe qi of the heart-mind. He asserts the will, the capacity\nof the heart-mind to form aims or intentions, directs (shuai\n\u5e25) the body\u2019s qi (Mengzi 2A8). When he\nis asked what he means by saying that he is good at nourishing his\nflood-like qi, he answers that his qi is exceedingly\ngreat and strong, and if he nourishes it with uprightness\n(zhi \u76f4), it will fill the space between Heaven and\nearth (Mengzi 2A14). Qi, cultivated in appropriate\nways, realizes the moral virtues attributed to the heart-mind.\nMencius\u2019s heart-mind is the part of a person\u2019s qi\nthat has the function of guiding the rest of its qi.\n\nOn the other hand, Chinese popular beliefs about ghosts and spirits\nhave been discussed as weighing against or at least calling into\nquestion the idea that Chinese thought is free of dualistic\ntendencies. One such belief that appears in some early Chinese texts,\nsuch as the Chunqiu Zuozhuan\nzhu\u6625\u79cb\u5de6\u50b3\u6ce8), is that if people\ndie a violent death, their po \u9b44 soul and their\nhun \u9b42 soul become stirred up and take malicious action\nagainst the living. This suggests the hun and po\nsouls are hived off from the body\u2019s qi, perhaps in a\nvery rarefied form. Nowhere is there a clear and consistent statement\nruling this out (Goldin 2015: 62, n. 13). Separate from ghosts, early\nChinese texts refer to shen (\u795e) as somethings ghosts\nmay or may not have which gives the capacity for behavior guidance\nthat the living have. It is sometimes depicted as leaving the body at\ndeath and taking up residence in a realm where it can be addressed\nthrough sacrificial rituals by descendants. Translators routinely\nrender shen as \u201cspirit\u201d, that sapient part of a\nperson that can be cultivated to promote by their behavior what is\ncentral or important in the world. (Zhuangzi and\nXunzi). Neither bifurcates shen from qi but\nsuggests shen is the special kind of qi that is pure\nenergy\u2014like light.\n\nPaul Goldin points out passages in the Zhuangzi\n(\u838a\u5b50) where the heart-mind seems to be unaffected by\nquite drastic changes in the body, e.g., (Zhuangzi, Da\nZongshi \u5927\u5b97\u5e2b, sec. 5; Goldin 2003: 228).\nEdward Slingerland (2013) cites another passage in Zhuangzi\n(De Chong Fu \u5fb7\u5145\u7b26, sec. 4), a story of\npiglets who stop nursing at the body of their dead mother and run\naway, sensing she was not like them. They didn\u2019t love their\nmothers shape (xing \u5f62) but what moved or commanded\n(shi \u4f7f) it. Slingerland also cites what he describes\nas a random sample pre-Qin texts, including the recently discovered\nGuodian texts which he believes to manifest a strong folk belief in a\ndistinction of some sort. He acknowledges that his reading of the\npassages is controversial but hopes that it is supported by his\ncomprehensive sampling of texts. He allows that the distinction might\nnot be the Western ontological, substance dualism.\n\nThe distinction, he notes, is not a fundamental dualism of substance\nbut of a range of phenomena, from the bodily organ xin to the\npo and hun ghosts to the sapient shen\nwhich, Slingerland notes, can be compounded. And in\nMengzi 2A, the heart-mind and bodily qi interact:\nthe heart-mind not only commands the qi through its\nintentions, but can be moved by its qi when it is not unified\nin its intentions. Unlike Descartes\u2019 mind, xin\u2019s\nqi can interact with both the body\u2019s qi and\nthe wider qi filling the space between Heaven and earth. That\nimage merges physical stuff, the body and heart-mind in a spiritual\nand moral, as well as physical, space. It suggests human unity with\nthe rest of the world as an organic whole.\n\nThe heart-mind is not only the seat of cognition but also of emotions\nand desires, which consist of qi. Chinese philosophers do not\nexplain behavior by a combination of cognitive and affective factors.\nFinally, even though Slingerland labels the strong holism defended by\nAmes and Jullien a \u201cmyth\u201d, he grants that in early Chinese\nphilosophy neither the mind nor postmortem spirits are immaterial.\nThey are rather some rarefied stuff that is continuous with natural\nphysical world (Slingerland 2013: 37). He (2013: 9) calls this\ninterpretive option a \u201cweak holism\u201d. Raphals (2015:\n133\u201334) observes that there is no clear boundary between\n\u201cweak holism\u201d and \u201cweak dualism\u201d. Given that\nphysicalism acknowledges the continuity of matter and energy, we can\nperhaps circumvent these attempts to fit Chinese philosophy into\nWestern categories, and simply observe a similar continuity of these\nelements of Chinese qi-naturalism that explain the functions\nof the heart-mind, thinking, feeling and intentions in behavior. The\nrest of bodily qi, as the Mengzi says, carries out\nthe commands of the heart-mind, or as the Zhuangzi responds,\nother bodily organs (e.g., the stomach) can exert their own\nmotivational influence, and their guidance sometimes manifests itself\nin behavior.\n\nWe conclude the Chinese view is a genuine alternative to substance\ndualism, differing from reductive materialism in a way arguably\ncompatible with modern physics. This could lead one to treat the\nChinese conception of qi as referring to matter-energy while\nnot having the same intension. It leaves open the choice to see it as\na form of panpsychism (David Chalmers 1996 and Thomas Nagel 1979) or\nnot.\n\nFunctional distinctions between heart-mind and body accord with the\nfunctional holism exhibited by organic wholes constituted by systems\nof their parts (Wang 2013; Wong 2020). The relationships are sometimes\ncharacterized as \u201ccorrelative\u201d. What is meant by this term\nvaries (see Granet 1934; Needham 1954; Graham 1989; Hall & Ames\n1998), but all refer to analogies between kinds (lei\n\u7c7b). The most general of these kinds were yin and\nyang, two types of qi that constitute other things\nby their interaction: yin to contract and yield (associated\nwith darkness and the feminine), and yang to expand and\ndominate associated with light and the masculine). Together, they form\na whole, whether in the world or the human person. Their interaction\ncan involve opposition, complementarity, and cyclical alternation\n(Wang 2013).\n\nThough the nature of the interactions is sometimes described as\nnon-causal, the contrast is most plausibly made with reference to\nmechanical and linear notions of causation in which the effect (like a\nbilliard ball hit by another billiard ball) is purely passive and\ninert. The interactions envisioned in Chinese philosophy are not\nnecessarily incompatible with alternative notions of causation in\nwhich the cause \u201cworks with the tendencies of the thing\naffected\u201d (Perkins 2019). This is in keeping with the paradigm\nof wholes being the biological and the organic. Mengzi conceives of\nmoral seeds/sprouts in human nature (discussed in\n \u00a72.4\n below) that grow into moral virtues through the agent\u2019s moral\nreflection and action as these are influenced by secure material\nlivelihood and ethical education. Cultivating a person\u2019s\nvirtue-seed, then, is an instance of external factors interacting with\ninnate tendencies.\n\nOne distinctive characteristic of Chinese philosophy is its practical\nand ethical orientation (\u2018ethical\u2019 is here meant broadly\nto include all normative guidance and not merely morality). Daoist\ndao is broader than the moralist\u2019s concern with\nyi (morality). The Zhuangzi focuses on this broad\nsense of how (the way) to live (see\n \u00a72.5\n below). The organization and function of these parts of humans as\nwell as our interaction as part of the natural world (natural\ndao) are relevant to this discussion. The Confucians,\nespecially Mengzi, focus more inwardly on a hierarchy of\nfunctions/organs. Daoists, and to a lesser degree, Mohists and the\nXunzi address a broader arrangement of humans as a part of\nnature. These different conceptions of how the heart-mind is to relate\nto other parts of the body (the appetites and moods) and natural world\nground ethical discussion in ancient China. The Zhuangzi\noffers a less hierarchical conception than the Mengzi.\n",
