    "main_text": "Arguments for Moral Responsibility Skepticism || Luck\n2.4 Luck\n\nAnother argument that maintains that regardless of the causal\nstructure of the universe we lack free will and moral responsibility\nholds that free will and basic desert moral responsibility are\nincompatible with the pervasiveness of luck (see N. Levy\n2009a, 2011; cf. Haji 2016). This argument is intended not only as an\nobjection to event-causal libertarianism, as the luck\nobjection is, but extends to compatibilism as well. At the heart\nof the argument is the following dilemma: either actions are subject\nto present luck (luck around the time of the action), or they\nare subject to what Thomas Nagel (1979) influentially named\nconstitutive luck (luck that causes relevant properties of\nagents, such as their desires, beliefs, and circumstances), or both\n(N. Levy 2011). Either way, luck undermines moral responsibility since\nit undermines responsibility-level control. This is what Neil Levy\ncalls the Luck Pincer and it can be summarized as follows\n(Levy 2011: 84\u201397; as summarized in Hartman 2017: 43):\n\n\nUniversal Luck Premise: Every morally significant act is\neither constitutively lucky, presently lucky, or both.\n\nResponsibility Negation Premise: Constitutive and present\nluck each negate moral responsibility.\n\nConclusion: An agent is not morally responsible for any\nmorally significant acts. \n\n\nLet us examine the argument in more detail, focusing first on what\nexactly is meant by \u201cluck.\u201d\n\nWhile there are several competing accounts of \u201cluck\u201d in\nthe literature, the Luck Pincer is couched in terms of a modal account\n(N. Levy 2011; cf. Pritchard 2005, 2014; Driver 2012; Hales 2015,\n2016; Latus 2000, 2003; Hartman 2017; Zimmerman 1987, 2002, 2009;\nCoffman 2015; see also entry on\n moral luck).\n The modal account, as developed by Levy (2011), defines luck by way\nof possible worlds without reference to indeterminism or determinism,\nand it classifies luck as either chancy or not\nchancy. An agent\u2019s being chancy lucky is defined\nas follows: \n\n\nAn event or state of affairs occurring in the actual world is chancy\nlucky for an agent if (i) that event or state of affairs is\nsignificant for that agent; (ii) the agent lacks direct control over\nthe event or state of affairs; and (iii) that event or state of\naffairs fails to occur in many nearby possible worlds; the proportion\nof nearby worlds that is large enough for the event to be chancy lucky\nis inverse to the significance of the event for the agent. (N. Levy\n2011: 36)\n\n\nOn the other hand:\n\n\nAn event or state of affairs occurring in the actual world that\naffects an agent\u2019s psychological traits or dispositions is\nnon-chancy lucky for an agent if (i) that event or state of affairs is\nsignificant for that agent; (ii) the agent lacks direct control over\nthat event or state of affairs; (iii) events or states of affairs of\nthat kind vary across the relevant reference group, and\u2026in a\nlarge enough proportion of cases that event or state of affairs fails\nto occur or be instantiated in the reference group in the way in which\nit occurred or was instantiated in the actual case. (N. Levy 2011:\n36)\n\n\nNote that the first two conditions are the same for an agent\u2019s\nbeing chancy and non-chancy lucky\u2014i.e., (i)\nsignificance, and (ii) lack of direct control. And\nwe can say that an event is significant for an agent if she\ncares about the event and it can have either good or bad significance\nfor her (N. Levy 2011: 13). It may, for instance, be chancy whether I\nhave an odd or even number of hairs on my head at 12 noon, but it\nwould be strange to say that this is a matter of luck since we\ngenerally reserve the appellation \u201cluck\u201d for events that\nmatter (N. Levy 2011: 13)\u2014i.e., we do not generally\nspeak of entirely trivial events as lucky (i.e., as good or bad for an\nagent). With regard to the second condition, we can say that an agent\nhas direct control over an event if the agent is able (with\nhigh probability) to bring it about by intentionally performing a\nbasic action and if the agent realizes that this is the case (N. Levy\n2011: 19; cf. Coffman 2007).\n\nTo help understand how the third condition differs in the two\ndefinitions\u2014i.e., the modal condition (chancy luck) and\nthe uncommon instantiation condition (non-chancy\nluck)\u2014lets consider some examples. A paradigmatic example of a\nchancy lucky event is Louis\u2019s winning the lottery. This is\nbecause (i) he lacks direct control over winning the lottery since\nthere is no basic action that he can perform to bring it about, (ii)\nthe event of his winning the lottery is also at least minimally\nsignificant, and (iii)\u2014the modal condition\u2014in most close\npossible worlds with a small divergence from the actual world, Louis\ndoes not win. On the other hand, Elaini may be non-chancy lucky for\nbeing a genius with a high IQ in comparison with her peers (Hartman\n2017: 44\u201346). This is because (i) Elaini lacks direct control\nover being a genius, (ii) it is significant for her, and\n(iii)\u2014the uncommon instantiation condition\u2014being a genius\nis not commonly instantiated in that reference group (assuming, of\ncourse, that most of her actual peers are not geniuses).\n\nTo these three conditions, we can now also add the distinction between\npresent luck and constitutive luck. We can say that\nan agent\u2019s decision is the result of present luck if a\ncircumstantial factor outside of the agent\u2019s control at or near\nthe time of action significantly influences the decision. Such\ncircumstantial factors could include the agent\u2019s mood, what\nreasons happen to come to her, situational features of the\nenvironment, and the like. For instance: \n\n\nOur mood may influence what occurs to us, and what weight we give to\nthe considerations that do cross our mind\u2026Our attention may\nwander at just the wrong moment or just the right one, or our\ndeliberation may be primed by chance features of our environment. (N.\nLevy 2009a: 245; see also 2011: 90) \n\n\nIn contrast, we can say that an agent\u2019s decision is the result\nof constitutive luck if that decision is partially settled by her\ndispositional endowment, which is outside of her control (N. Levy\n2011: 87). Finally, while present luck is limited to cases of chancy\nluck, constitutive luck can be a subspecies of both chancy and\nnon-chancy luck since it can refer to a disposition that an agent\npossesses in either a chancy or a non-chancy way (N. Levy 2011:\n87).\n\nWith these definitions in place we can now return to the Luck\nPincer and see how libertarian and compatibilist accounts fare\nagainst it. Libertarian accounts famously face the problem of\nexplaining how a decision or action can be free, given the libertarian\ndemand for indeterminacy immediately prior to directly free action.\nMoral responsibility skeptics and compatibilists alike have long\nargued that such indeterminacy makes the action unacceptably chancy,\nin a way that is responsibility-undermining (see, e.g., N. Levy 2009a,\n2011; Mele 1999a,b, 2006; Haji 2002, 2004, 2005, 2014; van Inwagen\n2000; Pereboom 2001, 2014a; for some replies see\nKane 1999; Clarke 2005b; Mele 2017). And it is argued that this\napplies to both event-causal and agent-causal versions of\nlibertarianism (see Mele 2006; Haji 2004, 2016; N. Levy 2011). The\nkind of luck that is problematic here is present chancy luck,\nsince the agent\u2019s putatively \u201cfree\u201d decision is\nchancy (i.e., the same decision would fail to occur in many nearby\npossible worlds), significant, and the circumstantial factor outside\nof the agent\u2019s control (i.e., the indeterminate event(s)) occurs\njust prior to the decision. \n\nPeter van Inwagen (2000) makes vivid the lack of control a libertarian\nagent has over genuinely undetermined events by considering what would\nhappen if God rolled back the relevant stretch of history to some\npoint prior to an undetermined event and then allowed it to unfold\nonce more (N. Levy 2009a: 238). Since events would not unfold in the\nsame way on the replay as they did the first time round, since these\nare genuinely undetermined, and nothing the agent does (or is) can\nensure which undetermined possibility is realized, the outcome of this\nsequence (in this case the agent\u2019s decision) is a matter of\nluck. Such luck, skeptics argue, is responsibility-undermining.\n\nCompatibilist accounts of moral responsibility, on the other hand, are\nvulnerable to their own powerful luck objection (N. Levy 2009a, 2011;\nHaji 2003, 2016; cf. Vargas 2012b). We can divide compatibilist\naccounts into two main categories: historical and\nnon-historical. Historical accounts are sensitive to the\nmanner in which an agent comes to be the kind of person they are, in\nthe circumstances in which they find themselves (see Mele 1995, 2006;\nFischer & Ravizza 1998). If an agent, for instance, decides to\ndonate a large sum of money to Oxfam, historical accounts of moral\nresponsibility hold that it is important how the agent came to have\nsuch a generous nature and make the decision they did\u2014for\nexample, did the agent have a normal history and acquire the\ndisposition to generosity naturally, or did a team of neuroscientists\n(say) engineer them to have a generous nature? Non-historical\naccounts, on the other hand, maintain that moral responsibility\ndepends instead on non-historical factors\u2014like whether an agent\nidentifies with his/her own desires (Frankfurt 1971) or the quality of\nan agent\u2019s will (Scanlon 1998).\n\nThe main problem with historical accounts is that they cannot\nsatisfactorily explain how agents can take responsibility for their\nconstitutive luck. The problem here is analogous to the problem raised\nby manipulation arguments (N. Levy 2009a, 2011). Manipulated agents\nare the victims of (very bad) luck: the manipulation is significant\nfor them, they lack control over its (non-) occurrence, and it is\nchancy, in as much as there are nearby possible worlds in which the\nmanipulation does not occur (N. Levy 2009a: 242). The problem of\nconstitutive luck is similar in that an agent\u2019s\nendowments\u2014i.e., traits and dispositions\u2014likewise\nresult from factors beyond the agent\u2019s control, are significant,\nand either chancy or non-chancy lucky. A historical compatibilist\ncould respond, as they often do to manipulations cases, that as long\nas an agent takes responsibility for her endowments,\ndispositions, and values, over time she will become morally\nresponsible for them. The problem with this reply, however, is that\nthe series of actions through which agents shape and modify their\nendowments, dispositions, and values are themselves significantly\nsubject to present luck\u2014and, as Levy puts it, \u201cwe cannot\nundo the effects of luck with more luck\u201d (2009a: 244). Hence,\nthe very actions to which history-sensitive compatibilists point, the\nactions whereby agents take responsibility for their endowment, either\nexpress that endowment (when they are explained by\nconstitutive luck) or reflect the agent\u2019s present luck, or both\n(see N. Levy 2009a: 247, 2011).\n\nIf this argument is correct, present luck is not only a problem for\nlibertarianism it is also a problem for historical compatibilism. And\nwhile present luck may be a bigger problem for libertarians,\nsince they require the occurrence of undetermined events in the causal\nchain leading to free action, the problem it creates for historical\ncompatibilists is nonetheless significant. With compatibilism, we need\nto assess the implications of present luck in conjunction\nwith the implications of constitutive luck. When we do, we see that\nthough it might often be the case that the role played by present luck\nin the decisions and actions of compatibilist agents is relatively\nsmall, it is the agent\u2019s endowment\u2014directly, or as\nmodified by the effects of present luck, or both\u2014which explains\nwhy this is so (N. Levy 2009a: 248). An agent\u2019s pre-existing\nbackground of reasons, desires, attitudes, belief, and\nvalues\u2014against which an agent deliberates\u2014is the endowment\nfrom constitutive luck, inflected and modified, to be sure, but\ninflected and modified by decisions which either express\nconstitutive luck, or which were not settled by the endowment, and\ntherefore were subject to present luck (N. Levy 2009a: 248).\nHence, the Luck Pincer: actions are either the product of constitutive\nluck, present luck, or both. \n\nNon-historical accounts, on the other hand, run into serious\ndifficulties of their own with the epistemic condition on control over\naction. The epistemic condition maintains that moral responsibility\nfor an action requires that the agent understands that, and how, the\naction is sensitive to her behavior, as well as appreciation of the\nsignificance of that action or culpable ignorance of these facts (N.\nLevy 2011: ch.5; cf. Rosen 2003, 2004, 2008; Zimmerman 1997, 2009;\nVargas 2005a). Because the epistemic condition on control is so\ndemanding and itself subject to the Luck Pincer, non-historical\naccounts of compatibilism (as well as other accounts that may survive\nthe above arguments) face a serious challenge (see N. Levy 2011,\n2009b). Consider cases of non-culpable ignorance. Imagine, for\ninstance, that a 16th century surgeon operates on a patient\nwithout washing his hands or sterilizing his equipment, and as a\nresult his patient gets an infection and dies. The surgeon would not\nbe blameworthy in this situation because he was non-culpably ignorant\nof the risks of non-sterilization, since germ theory was not\nestablished until much later. In this and other cases of non-culpable\nignorance, the fact that agents are ignorant of the relevant details\nis frequently a matter of luck\u2014either present luck or\nconstitutive luck or both.\n\nWe can say that non-culpable ignorance is chancy lucky when an agent\nfails to know that p (where p is significant for\nher), lacks direct control over whether she knows that p, and\nin a large proportion of nearby possible worlds does know that\np. Lets say I drop my daughter Maya off at a friend\u2019s\nhouse for a play date. She has a peanut allergy and I forget to inform\nthe other parent, Dolores, at the time of drop-off. When I get to the\ncoffee shop, I realize this and immediately text Dolores about the\nallergy, but because I\u2019m in a \u201cdead zone\u201d the\nmessage does not go through. Not having received my text, Dolores\nproceeds to give the kids a snack with peanut butter in it, resulting\nin Maya having a near-fatal reaction. Dolores\u2019 non-culpable\nignorance in this case is chancy lucky since in a large portion of\nnearby possible worlds she would have received the text. The\n16th century surgeon example, on the other hand, is better\nseen as an example of non-chancy luck, since his ignorance is the\nresult of bad luck inasmuch as beliefs about germs vary across agents\nin different historical periods (the relevant reference group here),\nrather than nearby possible worlds. \n\nSince non-culpable ignorance is responsibility-undermining and much\nmore common than philosophers typically think, it gives additional\nforce to the Luck Pincer. Thanks to luck, distant or present, agents\nwho perform wrongful actions typically lack freedom-level\ncontrol over their actions because they fail to satisfy the epistemic\ncondition on such control (N. Levy 2011: 115\u201316). In cases of\nunwitting wrongdoing, there often is no plausible candidate for a\nculpable benighting action that could ground blameworthiness\n(N. Levy 2011: 131). Furthermore, it is often the case that we cannot\nreasonably demand of agents that they do not act in ways that express\ntheir epistemic vices (N. Levy 2011: 126). When an agent does not see\nthat she is managing her moral views badly, it would be unfair to\nblame her for doing wrong if she had no internal reasons for omitting\nher bad behavior. This is because, when an agent is managing her moral\nviews badly from the point of view of objective morality, it\nis often the case that her subjective moral values and\nbeliefs\u2014which ex hypothesi she does not know are\nwrong\u2014are governing herself in a perfectly rational and\nconsistent way. Since these internal moral values and beliefs are\nthemselves a matter of luck\u2014either present, constitutive, or\nboth\u2014we once again arrive at the Luck Pincer. It would seem,\nthen, that present luck, constitutive luck, or both, swallows all, and\nboth libertarian and compatibilist accounts fail to preserve moral\nresponsibility.\n\nFor some objections to the Luck Pincer, see Talbert (2013, 2016),\nHartman (2017), Hales (2016). For a different argument based on luck for the conclusion that agents are far less morally blameworthy than we have hitherto\npresumed, see Haji (2016). For a compatibilism that is responsive to\nconcerns of luck but that resists full-blown skepticism about free\nwill and moral responsibility, see Paul Russell\u2019s free will\npessimism (2017). \n",
